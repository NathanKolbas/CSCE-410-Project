Barney's Version

Based on the novel by Mordecai Richler
WHITE 10-23-09 1.
INT. DEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A tumbler of Scotch. A half empty bottle of Macallan's. A
burning Montecristo cigar in an ashtray.

A hand picks up a telephone and dials.

BARNEY
I'd like to speak with my wife.
BLAIR (V.0.)
(groggy) ; ;
Barney...? It's three in the morning.
BARNEY
Put my wife on the phone.
BLAIR (V.0.)
She's not your wife and I'm not waking
her.
BARNEY

Then just ask her what she wants me to

do with these nude photos I have of

her. Come to think of it, you might

actually want them if only to see what

Miriam looked like in her prime.
Click. Dial tone.

Barney hangs up, puffs on his cigar. Feeling good. Photos
of him and Miriam strewn over the table. None of them nudes.

CUT TO:
INT. DEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - MORNING
The bottle of Macallan's now empty. The cigar burned to the nub.

An ALARM CLOCK DRONES on and on from the bedroom. It finally
gets turned off.

BARNEY PANOFSKY (64), hung over and in his robe, lumbers
down the hallway and to the front door.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BARNEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

He picks up the morning newspaper. Scans the front page.
Something he reads upsets him.

BARNEY
Fuck.

A SOCCER BALL rolls and stops at Barney's feet.
WHITE 10-23-09 2.

JUSTIN (8) runs up and grabs the ball. He stares up at
Barney. Barney stares back

NEIGHBOR (0.S.)
Justin, come on, we're late.

JUSTIN
Hi Barney.

BARNEY
Good morning.

Justin runs off. Barney turns back inside.

INT. KITCHEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - LATER

Now dressed, Barney reads the paper as he finishes his bagel
and lox. He looks at his watch -- shit, he's late. Drops
the paper on the table. Puts the dishes in the sink.

INSERT - NEWSPAPER BLURB - FRONT PAGE

"BOOK REVIEW: Detective Sean O'Hearne writes his own account
of the scandal that rocked the city 30 years ago..."

Beside the blurb is an old picture of BARNEY IN HANDCUFFS.
INT. KITCHEN - BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

He grabs his cell phone and turns it on, then notices the
answering machine.

INSERT - BLINKING ANSWERING MACHINE: 10 MESSAGES.

He presses PLAY, but only listens to the first few words of
each message before fast forwarding to the next.

ANSWERING MACHINE
(female voice)
Hi dad, I know it's early... hi dad,
me again... where are you... dad,
call meeee...

The next few messages from an angry MALE VOICE.
ANSWERING MACHINE (CONT'D)
Dad, its Michael.... Dad, I know
you're there... Are you screening?...

Barney turns the machine OFF. Now he can't find his keys.
Scours the house for them. His cell phone RINGS.

BARNEY
Hello?
WHITE 10-23-09
EXT. STREET - MORNING

INTERCUT WITH KATE (24), Barney's daughter. Walking to her
job as a grade school teacher, carrying a bag and thermos.

KATE
Daddy, where were you? I've been
calling all morning.

BARNEY
The ringer was off.

KATE
Blair had a heart attack last night.

BARNEY
Really?

KATE
Really.

BARNEY
How bad?

KATE

Minor. He thought it was indigestion.

BARNEY
Putz.

He finds his keys. Rushes out the door

KATE
Dad, it's still a heart attack.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Barney hurries down the hallway to the elevator.

BARNEY
That's true. The long term effects
of these things don't often show up
until later. Impotence is still on
the table.

KATE
Are you not at all concerned that
you might have caused this?

BARNEY
Why would I be?

KATE
Mom told me about the phone call
last night.
WHITE 10-23-09 4.

That triggers a distant alcohol fogged memory. DING. The
elevator arrives. He steps in.

BARNEY
I'll call you back. I'm stepping in
the elevator.

KATE
You better.

Barney grins from ear to ear, filled with glee at this news.
On the elevator doors closing we...

CUT TO:
INT. CAR - DRIVING - MORNING

Barney driving his Mercedes, back on the phone with Kate who
is approaching the school she teaches at.

BARNEY
I may have accidentally dialed their
number.

KATE

Sure, dad. But you do have an out -
it seems that Blair was already having
chest pains when you called but he
didn't want to bother mom with it.

It was your call that woke her, and
she then insisted on taking him to

the hospital.

BARNEY
So I saved his life.

KATE
My hero.

BARNEY
Did you see the paper today?

KATE
I did. Are you okay?

BARNEY
Yeah, I'm fine.
(beat)
I'll call you later.

KATE
Okay. Love you.

BARNEY
Love you too.

EXT. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS - DAY

Barney drives up to the offices of TOTALLY UNNECESSARY
PRODUCTIONS and pulls into his personal parking spot.

CUT TO:
INT. TV SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

We drop right into a scene of Barney's TV show, the long
running soap - "O'MALLEY OF THE NORTH".

The CONSTABLE, O'MALLEY, mid-50's and still handsome, is
being tended to by a female NURSE played by SOLANGE (52),
making a "house call" to the local bar.

SOLANGE
(wrapping a bandage)
How does that feel, O'Malley?

O'MALLEY
Warm and tight.

SOLANGE, originally cast as the "sexpot" of the show, her
uniform is inappropriately low cut and tight for a woman her
age, but she works it like she's still the cat's meow.

Barney quietly walks onto the sound stage, and sits in his
producers chair. The scene is painful for him watch. He
pulls over a WARDROBE GIRL.

BARNEY
Can we do something about her outfit?

WARDROBE GIRL
I tried. She has them altered
herself.

DIRECTOR
CUT!
(to Barney)
How was that?

BARNEY
Appallingly bad.

DIRECTOR
Great. MOVING ON.

Solange's bright smile instantly sours as she eyes Barney.

SOLANGE
I want to talk to you!

Barney immediately hustles himself away.
WHITE 10-23-09

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
Don't you run away from me!

She tries to go after him but is stopped by the sound guy
who needs to remove her mic.

FOUR EXECUTIVES descend upon him, struggling to keep pace,
including MARK (40). Everyone talking over each other

MARK EXECUTIVE
Did you see today's We need to go over the
paper? opening for next week's
episode.
MARK EXECUTIVE
The teaser is a minute And we lost the location
long- - so we have to rewrite it

for the studio--
Barney pushes through a door, leading everyone into --
INT. TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Rows of desks occupied by accountants, story editors
assistants. Barney whisks through the aisles - everyone
still hot on his tail.

BARNEY
(announcing to entire
office)
Good morning everyone. Yes I've
seen today's paper, no I don't give
a flying fuck and neither should
you, let that be the end of it.

MARK
Barney, the network wants to make a
really big deal about the 30th season.

BARNEY
That's in a year.

MARK
They're looking ahead, and they're
open to renewing for two more seasons.
(nervous)
But they have a few suggestions.

BARNEY
How long have you worked for me?

MARK
Eighteen years.
WHITE 10-23-09
BARNEY
So why do you still act like a girl
asking permission for a sleepover?
Tell me what the hell it is.
Barney heads into --

INT. BARNEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The exec's all follow inside and stand in silence.

Mark

steps forward as Barney flips through mail on his desk.

MARK
They want to bring in a new face.
Someone young. Maybe give Solange a
sexy, young niece who comes to live
with her--

BARNEY
They want to fire Solange?

MARK
They want us to write her down in
favor of a new character

BARNEY
No. No way.

MARK
We'll do it in a classy way--

BARNEY
I won't humiliate her like that.
She's been on the show since day
one. I'll give her your job before
that happens.

MARK
They're not asking.
If we don't do it, this is our last
season. No one under fifty watches

the show.

BARNEY
So they want to bring in some tits
and ass?

MARK

Isn't that why you first hired her?

Solange suddenly bursts through the crowd of Exec's and slams

a FOLDER down on Barney's desk.

SOLANGE
I want a word with you NOW.
WHITE 10-23-09

Barney opens the folder and scans the papers inside.

BARNEY
What language is this?

SOLANGE
They're from Bulgaria. Press
clippings about me and they just

keep coming. They love me over there.

This proves what I'm really worth to
the foreign market.

Barney tosses the folder aside.

BARNEY
I'll give it my utmost attention.

SOLANGE
I hired a new lawyer, a real shark
and he says--

MARK
Whoa, whoa, Solange, why do we need
to bring lawyers into this?
Solange turns around and pushes the Exec's out.

SOLANGE
Out! I want to talk Barney alone.

MARK
Barney, we have to discuss--

SOLANGE
OUT!

She slams the door on them and turns to Barney.
instantly softens.

 

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
I feel like everyone is laughing at
me. Tell me honestly, how do I look?

Beat.

BARNEY
You look like the reason we're still
on the air. Sexy as hell.

SOLANGE
(teary)
Thank you.
(beat)
But you're still going to pay me
what I deserve.

Her tone
WHITE 10-23-09 9.
She stops just before exiting.

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
I saw the paper. How are you doing?

BARNEY
Fine.

Not wanting to get into it, Barney busies himself with moving
around papers. Solange takes the cue, then takes a deep
breath, puts her game face on and storms out, slamming the
door behind her for effect.

CUT TO:
INT/EXT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

Barney drives through downtown Montreal, eventually parking
in front of Grumpy's Bar

INT. GRUMPY'S BAR - DAY

Barney walks into his regular watering hole - GRUMPY'S BAR.
The bar spotted with regulars who mumble hello to him.

JILL THE BARTENDER serves him his usual.

JILL
You get home okay last night?

BARNEY
I got home.

With a glance, Jill directs Barney down the bar.

JILL
He's had more than a few already.

DETECTIVE SEAN O'HEARNE, around 60, slides off his barstool.
Grossly overweight, blotchy salmon red complexion.

O' HEARNE
You see that review in the paper
today? Not bad.

Barney ignores him. O'Hearne places a copy of the infamous
book he's written "WITH FRIENDS LIKE THESE" on the bar

O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
That's for you. I even signed it.

Barney opens the book - dumps a handful of peanuts on the
page, POUNDS it shut with his fist, then flips it back open
and starts eating from the cracked nuts.
WHITE 10-23-09 10.

O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
Why do you have to be like that? I
wrote a nice little note to you.

O'Hearne slides the book back over to himself and clumsily
flips to his hand written inscription. He's very drunk.

O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
"To Barney, none of this would have
been possible without you. All the
best, Detective Sean O'Hearne".

BARNEY
What the hell are you doing here?

O' HEARNE
This is a big day. I thought I'd
buy you a drink, share in the moment,
be a "mensch", like you might say.

Barney looks at O'Hearne. Marvelling at his idiocy.

BARNEY
For someone who professes to hate me
so much, you sure do go out of your
way to come around here a lot.

O' HEARNE
I just want to know what you did
with the body already.

BARNEY
You really want to know? Fine. I
carved him up with a chainsaw, dumped
the parts in the St. Lawrence river

O' HEARNE
Chainsaw, my ass. You'd never have
the guts to cut him up. If you won't
tell me now, promise you'll at least
leave me a note in your will.

BARNEY
C'mon O'Hearne, you're bound to go
first. Look at you - prick you with
a fork on a hot summer day and you'd
explode like a pan fried sausage.

O' HEARNE
This heart will still be pumping
strong when your prostate turns to
marble, Panofsky.
WHITE 10-23-09 11.

JILL
Why don't you just leave him alone
already?

O' HEARNE
Because he got away with murder,
sweetie.

(looking at Barney)
You screwed over everyone you ever
knew or cared about, and now the
whole world is going to know what a
cocksucking murderer you really are.

O'Hearne is right up in his face. INTENSE stare.

BARNEY
Your breath stinks.

O'Hearne has to tear himself away before he tries to kill
Barney. He slides the book back over to him.

O' HEARNE
It's a real page turner.

O'Hearne marches out. Barney's eyes reluctantly drift to
the COVER PHOTO of the book

INSERT - BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO CIRCA 1974, Barney with his
arm around his best friend BOOGIE.

FLASHBACK TO:
EXT. RESTAURANT - TRASTAVERE, ROME - NIGHT - PAST
TITLE: ROME, 1974

Barney is out cavorting with his crew - over educated
contemporaries living the bohemian life in Rome.

Barney's Algonquin Round Table.

Copious amounts of food and drink. Lively conversations
overlap, as we move around a crowded table. Locals, ex-pats
and plenty of girls. A few of Barney's standout friends being:

CEDRIC RICHARDSON, African American, actor, extremely handsome,
three fawning girls with him. LEO FASOLI, Italian bearded
artist, his pants and t-shirt speckled with paint.

CEDRIC
...I know that I can't just sit around
and wait for something to happen.

(MORE )
WHITE 10-23-09 12.

CEDRIC (CONT'D)

So I call up the director and tell
him: "I've been offered Othello for
the third straight year and I'm not
going to pass it up just to play the
fucking Chuck Wagon cook again. Who
do I look like, Roscoe Lee Brown?
"But that's how it's written" he
answers. So I tell him - "Roberto,
the time has come for the black man
to hold a gun instead of a spatula".

BARNEY
Amen!

CEDRIC
And he had the role rewritten for
me. I am now posse member number 4.

LEO
To Cedric, living the lessons of the
Bard: "be as great in act, as you
have in thought".

Everyone toasts. Barney's eyes light up as he leaps from
his chair to greet --

BARNEY
BOOGIE!

EVERYONE
Boogie/Welcome back! !

BOOGIE, Barney's best and most cherished friend. Tall and
lean, he possesses a physical and intellectual magnetism
that enchants everyone who meets him. He has a stunning girl
(THE COUNTESS) on his arm.

Boogie is greeted by all and handed some wine. Cedric makes
it a point to introduce himself to The Countess.

CEDRIC
I'm Cedric.

COUNTESS/MARIA
Maria.
(flirtatious)
You look familiar to me.

CEDRIC
I'm an actor.

MARIA
I knew it. You look like a movie
star.
WHITE 10-23-09 13.

The Countess then slides up to Boogie, whispers something in
his ear, kisses him deeply, then walks off to the bathroom.
Her exquisite beauty silences them all.

CEDRIC
Who is that?

BOOGIE
Ah, the Countess. A descendant of
Giuseppe Garibaldi, no less.

LEO
Where did you meet her?

BOOGIE

Somewhere between my blackout in
Lake Como and my hangover in Ste-
Maxime. If you could find out AND
get her name, that would be great.
But enough about that, I want to
hear about all of you. Leo, how was
your showing at Galerie Des Points?

The silence around the table indicates - "not so good".

BARNEY
His work is too bold for that crowd.

LEO
The show was a bust. I only sold
one piece - to Barney.

Barney holds up the painting to show Boogie.

CEDRIC
Barney - our very own patron of the
arts. Otherwise known as our only
friend with a real job.

Everyone toasts.

BOOGIE
(to Barney)
And so, my High Priest, did you get
through those books I sent you?

BARNEY
A few of them.

BOOGIE
Only a few? I sent them months ago.
What have you been doing with yourself?

BARNEY
Well, actually, I'm getting married.
WHITE 10-23-09 14.

BOOGIE
What?! To who?

CLARA (0.S.)
To me.

Boogie turns around to find CLARA CHAMBERS (26), tall, skinny,
pale and beautiful, gypsy shawl and skirt. Three months
pregnant, and slightly showing at her belly. She downs a
shot of Grappa and lights a cigarette as she sits.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Prince Charmingbaum here knocked me
up by way of a magical thirty seconds
of friction.

BARNEY
Where have you been? You didn't
come home last night.

CLARA
Who remembers?
(to Boogie)
Has he told you what he's doing now?
Exporting olive oil to some guy,
Hymie back in Montreal. It's like a
bad Jewish sitcom.

BARNEY
Someone needs to make a living.

CLARA
He comes to Europe and sells oil.
It's fucking humiliating. You're
not one of us. You're a voyeur--

BOOGIE
Okay, A toast to the newlyweds! To
your health, your happiness- -

CLARA
(at Barney)
And a three inch prick

EVERYONE
L'CHAIM!

Everyone drinks. Barney scowls at Clara. She instantly
switches gears to soft and loving.

CLARA
I'm sorry, baby. You're still my
yummy yid.
WHITE 10-23-09 15.

She gets on his lap, curling herself around him like a cat.
He starts to soften, the party around them continues on....

EXT. ROME STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Closing down the bar, the whole gang pours out into the
street. Barney and Boogie lead the way, sharing a flask
Barney shlepping Leo's painting with him.

BOOGIE
Why did you agree to marry her?

BARNEY
I got her pregnant.

BOOGIE
So? Clara's crazy. She's a
conversation piece, not a wife. And
how do you even know it's yours?

BARNEY
It's mine.

BOOGIE
If you say so.

Boogie turns to the gang: Leo pulling up the rear with his
girl. Cedric walking with one arm around Clara and the other
around the Countess, who is quite smitten with him.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)
So what's the plan everyone? What
are we doing?

CEDRIC
I have an early call time tomorrow.

LEO
Yeah, I'm exhausted.

BOOGIE
Oh, come on. TI don't believe what
I'm seeing.

CLARA
(lighting a cigarette)
Count me out. I'm already hung over
and I'm not even done being drunk
yet. Oh, yeah, and I'm fucking
pregnant too. C'mon, Barney.

BOOGIE
He's coming with me.
WHITE 10-23-09 16.

CLARA
Where are you going?

BOOGIE
Taking him out for a proper bachelor
party.

CLARA

Oh no, you're not.

BOOGIE
You don't own him just yet.

Boogie drags Barney down a side street.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)
Got any money?

BARNEY
Some. Why?

BOOGIE
Provisions.

INT. BOOGIE'S ROOM - HOTEL CISTERNA - LATER
Laid out on the table in Boogie's hotel room:

A bottle of Scotch, two packs of Gauloises, a pack of rolling
papers, a small ball of TINFOIL.

Barney finds two clean glasses in the messy room and pours
them each a drink. Boogie unwraps the tinfoil to reveal a
ball of OPIUM inside. Then gathers his drug paraphernalia.

BOOGIE
We have to do it all, Barney. Opium,
Horse, Hash - everything under and
behind the sun, on and off the table.
We only go around once.

They toast and drink. Boogie then hands Barney a thick
MANUSCRIPT off the floor

BARNEY
You finished it?!

BOOGIE
Not quite yet. But you can read it
so far.
Barney drops onto the mattress and starts right away.

3/4 OF A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH LATER
WHITE 10-23-09 17.
Barney has gone through a hundred pages so far
BARNEY

Boogie, this is brilliant. Absolutely
brilliant. When are they publishing it?

BOOGIE
They're not.

BARNEY
Why?

BOOGIE

I didn't submit it.

BARNEY
Why the hell not?

BOOGIE
I told you, it's not finished yet.
And anyway, I'm never giving it to
that feckless editor.

BARNEY
What about the advance they paid you?

BOOGIE
I wrote him another one.

BARNEY
Which?

Boogie reaches over and tosses Barney a manuscript.
INSERT - MANUSCRIPT: "VANESSA'S PUSSY"

BARNEY (CONT'D)
What's it about?

While Boogie weaves his tale, he heats up and crumbles some
of the Opium, preparing to smoke it in a pipe.

BOOGIE
It's a new interpretation of the
Book of Job, as told through Vanessa's
vaginal lips. Pious and pristine
Vanessa's Pussy is a pillar of
religious devotion. Then one day,
without warning or reason, Vanessa's
Pussy is suddenly fucked over and
over and over again by The Supreme
Being; a deity who erects himself
into this temporal world as The Great
Cock. After an ungodly amount of

WHITE 10-23-09 18.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)
drilling, and now a shell of the
hole she used to be, Vanessa's Pussy
surrenders her absolute devotion to
The Great Cock. As reward, her
elasticity is restored, but she's
left with a recurring odorous rash.

(beat)
For some reason the editor passed.

Barney looks at him dumfounded.

BARNEY
Let me guess - Vanessa is the editor's
wife.

BOOGIE
Was.

Boogie takes a hit off the pipe. Barney tries to stare him
down like a disapproving parent, but the sheer bravado of
the story makes them both crack up.
BARNEY

Jesus, Boogie, stop dicking around

and finish your book already.
Barney pours himself more Scotch and continues reading.

CUT TO:

EXT. STAIRS - CAMPIDOGLIO - DAY

Wedding day. Boogie, Cedric, Leo accompany Barney and Clara
up the steps to the Mayor's Marriage Office.

Clara is seven months pregnant, wearing a black veil. Cedric
helps her up the stairs.

Barney wears a mix and match tuxedo. He and Boogie walk
ahead of the others.

BOOGIE
Listen, you don't have to go through
with this.

BARNEY

You're saying this to me now?

BOOGIE
I'm just saying, no one will think
anything less of you.
WHITE 10-23-09 19.

BARNEY
(beat )
C'mon, we're already late.

INT. MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE - CAMPIDOGLIO - DAY
Everyone waits for the JUDGE who looks over their paperwork.
(JUDGE'S DIALOGUE IS IN ITALIAN AND SUBTITLED).

JUDGE
I vistri passaporti, prego

The Judge takes a cursory glance and hands them to his CLERK.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
I testimoni, prego - Bernardo
Moscovitz, Leonardo Fasoli.

Boogie and Leo step forward and sign the marriage license.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Barney Panofsky, firmi qui.

Barney signs.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Clara Charnofksy, firmi qui.

BARNEY
(in bad Italian)
Charnofsky? No, is chiama Clara
Chambers.

JUDGE
Non secondo il suo passaporto.

Clara says nothing. Barney grabs her passport to see for
himself.

CLARA
I was married to a Russian gangster
for maybe five days. I ran away on
the honeymoon. I just never bothered
to do the paperwork to change the
name back.

BARNEY
Did you not think to mention this?

CLARA
Don't worry, you still got yourself
a true blue Shiksa.
WHITE 10-23-09 20.

BARNEY
What else haven't you told me? Any
kids I don't know about?

CLARA
Only two - Yosel and Chaim. They're
locked in our attic. When you're
out getting the hockey scores I let
them down and force feed them pork
roast milkshakes through a funnel.

Dumfounded silence. Then --

Clara SNATCHES the pen from Barney's hand and signs the
license in a flash.

CLARA (CONT'D)
There.

CEDRIC
(beat)
Mazel Tov!

INT. BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THUNDER and LIGHTENING rage outside.

Barney holds Clara in his arms as she is curled on the bed,
clutching her black wedding veil, trembling with white knuckle
fear; a child terrified of the thunder.

All around the apartment we see scraps of half written poems,
sketches and paintings.

CLARA
I'm sorry.
(beat)
You still love your crazy Clara,
don't you?

BARNEY
(beat)
Of course.
(beat)
Can I get you anything? You haven't
eaten a thing all day.

CLARA
Maybe a piece of fruit.

Barney reaches over and hands her a BANANA off the table.
Clara begins to peel it from the WRONG END.

BARNEY
Why do you peel it like that?
WHITE 10-23-09 21.

CLARA
I read somewhere this is how monkeys
do it. I figured they should know.

She may be crazy, but she has her odd charms. Barney holds
her tight as she flinches at another rumble of thunder

CUT TO:
INT. AGOSTINO GEMELLI UNIVERSITY POLYCLINIC(HOSPITAL) - DAY

Barney runs through the halls of the hospital in Rome,
frantically demanding help from the nurse's desk.

BARNEY
(to Nurse, in Italian)
I need to find my wife - Clara
Panofsky. Or Chambers. Or maybe
Charnofsky.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - HOSPITAL - DAY
THE DOCTOR sits down, lights up a cigarette.

DOCTOR
Signor Panofsky - mi dispiace - I
will speak in English. I am afraid
the infant was a stillborn.

Barney is speechless.

DOCTOR (CONT'D)

But your wife is healthy and will

certainly be able to bear other children.
(beat)

I must ask if you know the biological

father - for our records.

BARNEY
I'm the father.

The doctor looks at Barney incredulously, then to his charts,
than back at Barney.

DOCTOR
Then you must be an Albino.

INT. CLARA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Barney enters and sits at Clara's bedside. She's sketching

a picture of Barney on a pad as they talk. Barney won't
look her in the eye.
WHITE 10-23-09 22.

CLARA
Every four hours they attach clamps
to my nipples and milk me like a
cow.
(beat)
I was sure it was yours--

BARNEY
Can we talk about this later?

Barney is visibly hurt and angry. Clara strokes his arm.

CLARA
Oh Barney, you really do wear your
heart on your sleeve.
(beat)
Now put it away, it's disgusting to
look at.

BARNEY
(up and leaving)
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

CLARA
I'm not going to let you divorce me!

Barney is already out the door
INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - DAY
Barney walks down the hallway where his friends are gathered
and looking somber. The Countess and Leo are consoling
Cedric. Barney makes a bee-line for Cedric and SUCKER PUNCHES
him. Boogie jumps in and wrestles Barney away from Cedric.
BOOGIE
Easy, man. C'mon. He just lost a
son.

Barney looks at Boogie - "what the fuck?". With an
incredulous grunt, he walks off.

EXT. BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Barney helps Clara out of a taxi and into their apartment
building.

INT. BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - DAY
Barney helps Clara onto the bed, pours her a glass of water

CLARA
Okay, I'm ready to talk now.

Barney waits.
WHITE 10-23-09 23.

CLARA (CONT'D)
I've already spoken with a lawyer.
If you divorce me I'm entitled to
half your income for the rest of
your life.

BARNEY
Clara, I never knew you had such a
practical streak in you.

CLARA

Surprise. Not all us Shiksa's are
chumps.

(lights a cigarette)
Look, I'm not a pig despite what you
might think. I'll settle for a year's
rent on this dump and an allowance
of fifty dollars a week.

BARNEY
I'll move out tomorrow.

CLARA
Oh look, the color's come back into
your cheeks. Now you can finally go
back home, tongue your way into proper
society and find yourself a nice
Jewish girl - someone who shops.

BARNEY
(grabbing a few clothes)
As always, your insight is dazzling.

CLARA
Come now, I did you a great favor.
You'll be able to entertain them all
at the United Jewish Appeal galas
with stories about Crazy Clara
Chambers before she got famous. Now
get the hell out while I try and
rustle up a proper fuck.

Barney walks out and never looks back.
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
Clara runs out and screams down the stairwell after Barney.
CLARA
Wait! I'm sorry, Barney! Let's

start over! Please, Barney! Please!

INT. BOOGIE'S ROOM - HOTEL CISTERNA - DAY

Barney is aggressively chopping vegetables as he prepares
food. Boogie crumples some hash to roll in a joint.

BARNEY
My uncle Irv offered to get me into
TV production. He says there's all
these tax loopholes in Canada that
make it foolproof.

BOOGIE
Pass the lighter off the table.

Barney reaches for the lighter. He sees an ENVELOPE addressed
to him. He opens it and pulls out a HANDWRITTEN NOTE:
CLARA'S VOICE (V.O.)

Dear Barney, Please come for dinner

tonight at eight. I think it's

important we talk. I'm sorry. I

really do miss you. I need you.

I'll even make latkes. Yours, Clara.

BARNEY
When did this come?

BOOGIE
What? Oh, that. Shit. Sorry, I forgot.
I think it came a few days ago.

Barney looks at Boogie with disgust, throwing the lighter at
him on his way out the door.

INT. STAIRWELL - VILLA DELLA FONTE - DAY
Barney runs up the stairs.
INT. BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Barney rushes in and finds a table set for a candlelight
dinner for two. The candles completely burned away.

BARNEY
Clara?

He slowly moves through the apartment...
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

A charred chicken and a tray of latkes out on the stove.
WHITE 10-23-09 25.
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Where Clara lies dead on the bed. An empty bottle of sleeping
pills at her side. Her sketches and poetry scattered all
over the room.

Barney drops to her, feels for a pulse. Nothing. His eyes
well up with tears...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - DAY

PANNING OVER soiled laundry, empty wine bottles, ashtrays
the abstract painting of Leo's... to a hung over Barney,
snoozing on the sofa, wakening to a POUNDING on the door.

Rising unsteadily, Barney climbs over packed cartons labelled:
"Clara's poetry, Clara's Sketches, Clara's Paintings". He
opens the door.

CHARNOFSKY (50), stands there. An Orthodox Jew, black hat,
black wool coat and a Van Dyke beard. His tie has been neatly
rent (cut) with scissors.

BARNEY
Are you here about the apartment?

CHARNOFKSY
I'm Chaim Charnofsky.

BARNEY
The Russian?

CHARNOFKSY
Brighton Beach. I'm Clara's father
Your machuten. Are you going to
invite me in?

Still in a haze, Barney steps to the side. Hands clasped
behind his back, Charnofsky wanders in, studying the
apartment. He is immediately drawn to a specific INK SKETCH:

The completed sketch Clara started in the hospital: Barney,
drawn to look like Satan, along with a group of demons
ravishing a pregnant young woman who looks much like Clara.

CHARNOFKSY (CONT'D)
Who would buy such a disgusting thing?

BARNEY
Actually, Clara made it.
(beat)
She said her parents were dead.
WHITE 10-23-09 26.

CHARNOFKSY
She's been saying that since she was
ten.
(looking Barney over)
So you're the one she married?
(off Barney's nod)
I understand there was a child.

BARNEY
We lost him.

CHARNOFKSY
So you lost a son and I lost a
daughter. May there be no more
mourning in your house or mine.
(beat)
You have a bisel Schnapps?

CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Barney pours them each a Scotch.

CHARNOFKSY
I'm the Cantor of the B'Nai Jacob
synagogue. It's not a princely
living, but they provide us with an
apartment.
(looking at boxes)
Clara's things?

BARNEY
Her notebooks. Poems, diaries, ink
drawings. People think highly of
her work. You should have a publisher
look at them.

CHARNOFKSY
Diaries, you said? Filth about me
and her mother, I'm sure. Ship them
to my nephew. He's a professor of
literature at NYU. He used to
encourage her.

Charnofsky finishes his drink. Pours himself another

CHARNOFKSY (CONT'D)
I can imagine the guilt you're
carrying right now, but you should
know this wasn't the first time my
Clara tried to kill herself. It all
started when she was twelve.

(MORE )
WHITE 10-23-09 27.

CHARNOFKSY (CONT'D)
Tearing her hair out in clumps, "I'm
not Jewish", "you're not my parents"
she'd scream. She would refuse to
eat, we'd have to force feed her
chicken soup through a funnel, then
she would vomit all over me on
purpose. She'd run away for days
and sneak black boys into the house
so the whole neighborhood could see.
My wife wanted to die. That's when
I started locking her in the attic.
She was a danger to everyone. My
wife would bring her food, leave it
outside the door.
Once she goes to collect the dishes
and lets out a shriek - you know
why? Clara left a number two on the
plate.

BARNEY
She was obviously sick.

CHARNOFSKY

You're telling me? We went to Dr.
Kupner. The Head Rabbi's son-in-
law, went to Harvard, the best in
town. You think Clara was grateful?
"He felt up my tits" she would scream
in front of everyone at the hospital.
It was a horror.

BARNEY
I think you should leave.

CHARNOFSKY
What? I've upset you?

BARNEY
Get out of here.

CHARNOFSKY
You dare speak to me that way? After
all my wife and I endured for that
child. We did everything we could,
but only God determines the outcome.

BARNEY
God didn't lock a sick child in the
attic. God didn't place his daughter
in the hands of a molester then
apologize for any embarrassment she
may have caused him.
WHITE 10-23-09 28.

CHARNOFSKY
You act all high and mighty with
me?!

Barney takes hold of his arm and frog-marches him to the
door and out into the hallway.

INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE BARNEY/CLARA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

CHARNOFSKY
You couldn't have made her so happy
either or she wouldn't have done
that to herself.

BARNEY
Get out.

CHARNOFSKY
The man at the embassy told me she
was dead two days before you found
her. Two days! Where were you her
loving husband?!
An irate Barney takes a menacing step toward him.

BARNEY
Get out NOW.

Charnofsky scrambles down the stairs, yelling back at Barney--
CHARNOFSKY
Murderer, oysvorf, mamzer. I wish
makkes on you and your unborn
children!

BACK TO PRESENT DAY.

Barney stirring a pot of boiling pasta. It's ready. Turns
the burner off. Pulls out a STRAINER from a cupboard.

He pauses for a moment, looking at the strainer quizzically.
He grabs the phone and dials.

BARNEY
Michael.

INT. MICHAEL'S LOFT - BROOKLYN - SAME TIME
MICHAEL (26), Barney's son, in his Brooklyn loft. Sparsely

decorated and immaculate except for his cluttered work area
filled with papers and stacks upon stacks of books.

INTERCUT

MICHAEL
Hi dad.

BARNEY
What do you call that thing you use
for pasta...?

MICHAEL
What?

BARNEY
I'm holding it in my goddamn hand -
the thing to strain pasta...

MICHAEL
A strainer?

BARNEY
The other word.

MICHAEL
Colander.

BARNEY
COLANDER. See, this is what you
have to look forward to.

Barney prepares his pasta as he talks.

Beat.

MICHAEL
This is why you called?

BARNEY
And to say hello.

MICHAEL
Hello.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
I read online that O'Hearne's book
finally came out.

BARNEY

Yeah, I heard about that.
MICHAEL

How is it?
BARNEY

How would I know? I wouldn't read
that garbage.
WHITE 10-23-09 30.

Barney shuts O'Hearne's book, which we now see was open and
dog-eared on the counter

Just then, Michael's fiancee CAROLINE (28) comes home. A
young lawyer in a power suit. She flips off her heels, gives
him a kiss.

CAROLINE
(whisper )
Who's that?
MICHAEL
My dad.

Caroline sneers.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Dad, I have to go, Caroline just got
home. She says hi.

BARNEY
No she doesn't. How's the thesis
coming along?

MICHAEL
It's not, but I did find a title:
"The colonialist racial ideologies of
Western modernism in Bellow's work".

BARNEY
Catchy.

MICHAEL
Thanks. I gotta go.

BARNEY
Sure.

Michael hangs up.

MOVE WITH BARNEY as he carries his bowl of pasta out to the
BAR where he fixes himself a Scotch.

After pouring his drink he pauses for a moment to stare at
one of the many personal photos hanging behind the bar
When he walks away WE REMAIN ON THE PHOTO he was looking at:

In Black & White - Barney and his uncle IRV NUSSBAUM posing
at a Fundraiser for Israel.

FLASHBACK TO:

TITLE: MONTREAL 1975

Barney is in the office of his uncle, IRV NUSSBAUM (60).
While Irv is on the phone, Barney peruses a wall of PLAQUES
dedicated to Irv for his efforts in supporting Israel.

IRV

(into phone)
--Abe, you know what happened last
night?
Some nazi punks took a shit right on
the steps of the Beth Zion... that's
right. That's why you can't get
complacent with your support - we need
Israel. I don't have to tell you where
things like this lead to - it starts
with a turd, next thing we're wearing
arm bands again... (nodding)...
wonderful, oh and you're coming for
dinner this Friday, right? Great.

Irv hangs up, pleased as punch.
IRV. (CONT'D)
Donations go through the roof when
shit like this happens. Let's eat.
Irv gets up and exits. Barney follows.
INT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS
Irv leads Barney through the factory.
IRV
I'm going to trust you with a few
pledge cards to begin with. You do
good for Israel, good will come your
way. Now, the rules of the game:
Never visit your target in the office
where he's king shit and you're just
another shmuck looking for a handout.
You lure the lion out with meat --

INT. MOISHE'S STEAK HOUSE - DAY

Lunch time. Black tie waiters carry big juicy steaks, cole
slaw, and pickles to businessmen in booths.

Barney having steak with ROBERT LANTOS. Barney looks a little
green around the collar.

IRV (V.0.)

stride in 'proper' society.
WHITE 10-23-09 33.

BARNEY
--And I hate to say it, but it could
happen here.

TARGET 3
Absolutely, we get that, but tell
Marv about the TV deal.

TARGET 2
Is it a good show?

ROBERT LANTOS
It's a mound of shit but it's the best
goddamn tax shelter I've ever had.

IRV
Gentlemen, I need to borrow my nephew
for a moment.

Irv escorts Barney away.

IRV (CONT'D)
What did I tell you, boychick?
Fundraising, producing, it's all the
same dance. Now listen, I got a
girl I want you to meet.

BARNEY
Irv, I don't need to be set up.

IRV
Listen, this girl's got it all -
comes from a VERY good family, she
has a master's from McGill, and she's
a real looker. Sit.

Irv taps the shoulder of THE SECOND MRS. P (30). The ultimate
'JAP'. Cute, voluptuous, stylishly dressed.

SECOND MRS. P
You must be Barney. Irv's told me
all about you.

LATER

 

Barney and The Second Mrs. P sit in a corner away from the
rest of the guests. They're hitting it off.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
--throughout the entire second year
of my master's degree I kept having
the same recurring dream where I'm 16
again, standing in Reuben's Butchershop
on St. Viateur wearing my hair ina
pigtail tied with this velvet ribbon

WHITE 10-23-09 34.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
my Aunt Sarah got me from Saks -- Did
you know Reuben? He was such a card.
When I was ten he'd come around from
behind the counter and ask "how come
a beauty like you isn't married yet?" -
So it's true your father is really a
cop? That's why you're not a square
like most of the Jewish boys I meet --
what are you smiling about? You're a
little devil aren't you...

Her grating qualities aside, she is sexy and the picture
perfect Jewish wife. Maybe Irv's right.

EXT. THE SECOND MRS. P'S PARENTS MANSION - NIGHT

Barney and IZZY (60), his father, walk up the steep steps.
Izzy's carrying a bottle of Scotch for a gift.

BARNEY
So, dad, remember, watch the language
and mind the manners.

IZZY
I got it, kid. Don't worry.

They reach the door. Barney rings the bell. The door opens--

A short, Polish housekeeper, stares at them coldly.

IZZY
Swanky.

INT. FORMAL DINING ROOM - LATER

Classical music. The gentle tinkling of silver cutlery on
fine china.

Dinner with the soon to be IN-LAWS - the WASPiest Jews you've
ever seen. It's clear they are far from happy about this
union. Everyone eats in horribly awkward silence.

SECOND MRS. P
Mr. Panofsky, I bet you have a lot
of interesting stories, having been
a detective and all.
WHITE 10-23-09 35.

IZZY
Please, gorgeous, call me Izzy. And
I was just a beat cop. Jews don't
get promoted to detective in this
town.

MOTHER-IN-LAW
Have you encountered anti-semitism
in your profession?

IZZY
What do you think? Let me give you
an example: One of my first shifts
on the job, I corner four guys doing
a dope deal in an alley. Big score
for a rookie. I call for backup
"cuz the rules say you can only put
three in a patrol car, and I'm trying
to play it by the book. You think
they send anyone to help? The
dispatcher says to me: "your people
are good with numbers - you figure
it out". So I toss three in the
back, throw the fourth across the
hood, handcuff him to the side-view
mirror, then haul ‘em all in.

OTHER- IN-LAW
Oh my God, that's so dangerous.

IZZY
Only when he blocked my view.

 

MOTHER-IN-LAW
I meant for him.

IZZY
You can't be soft with these
degenerates.

FATHER- IN-LAW
Are you saying you were gratuitously
violent with suspected felons?

IZZY
Gratuitously? I always got paid, I
ain't gonna work for free.

BARNEY
He means unnecessarily.

IZZY
Look, when a feller is young and you
give him authority, he likes to push

WHITE 10-23-09 36.

IZZY (CONT'D)
people around. But I had to be extra
careful because I knew my name was
Panofsky. And most of the time I
was.

FATHER- IN-LAW
Most? Did you ever consider that
maybe your career advancement was
stunted by your professional conduct
and not by imagined prejudices?

IZZY

I call it like I see it. I wore my
name on my badge for everyone to see
and all I ever did was walk the beat.
But you're the one with the mansion
on the hill, so what do I know?

(to Second Mrs. P)
You got brains from him and beauty
from her - what a sweet little
casserole you are. Let's make a
toast.

Izzy, Barney and The Second Mrs. P raises their glasses.
The In-Laws don't even reach for theirs.

IZZY (CONT'D)
To the blessed match of our lovebirds.
You never know what tomorrow brings.

So get to shtupping and multiply
already.

Under the table Mrs. P squeezes Barney high up his leg.
Barney flinches, then drinks along with Izzy and Mrs. P.
The In-Laws set their glasses back down without sipping.
Everyone continues eating.

IZZY (CONT'D)
This chicken is great.

Cutlery tinkling...

MOTHER-IN-LAW
It's fish.

BARNEY
I was starting to think you weren't
going to show up. It's been two
months since I last heard from you.

BOOGIE
Has it really? Shit, have I got
stories for you.

BARNEY
That, I have no doubt of.

BOOGIE
Listen, man, are you sure you want
to go through with this? We can
turn around and be on a flight to
Rome in a few hours - no questions
asked. Lunch at Dal Bolognese on me.

BARNEY
C'mon, you haven't even met her yet.
Anyway, I have two tickets in the
reds to the Stanley Cup game tonight.
Do you think after the dinner I can
slip out to catch the third period?
BOOGIE
I don't know. Brides tend to be a
little touchy about things like that.

BARNEY
Fuck me.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

300 guests. A huge affair. The band is ripping it up through
a raucous HORA that carries over the following moments:

Barney and his mates do the Hora the way it should be done.

THE SECOND MRS. P SQUEALING and BARNEY feeling queasy as
they are HOISTED up and down on chairs.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

AN ARMY OF SERVERS burst forth from the kitchen carrying
entrees. PLATES LAND at various tables.

MOVING DOWN THE HEAD TABLE:

The Second Mrs. P talking with her mother --

MOTHER-IN-LAW
Darling, I just have to tell you
again how gorgeous you look. And
did you see how Marsha was looking
at you?

SECOND MRS. P
Did I ever? Poison from her eyes
she was so jealous. Do you remember
her dress? She looked like a futon.

IZZY making eyes at a curvaceous woman with a plunging
neckline -- Father-In-Law watching Izzy with disdain but
Maintaining a polite smile for appearances. His gaze is
then drawn further down the table by --

BOOGIE, LEO AND CEDRIC toasting him.

Shit.

Barney downs another shot, then looks back to the dancefloor
where he sees IZZY slow dancing with The Second Mrs. P.

DANCEFLOOR

IZZY
--I was denied the first time I tried
to get on the force because I was

Well, dark and handsome you most

trust me, he's the lucky one.

Izzy grins and lays his head and her ample bosom.

Boogie emerges from behind the band, wiping his nose from
having just done a hit of coke. He joins Barney, Izzy and
friends at the bar watching the game.

AT THE BAR
Everyone ROARS at a near miss.

BARNEY/BARTENDER
Go Habs! Come on!

They all do a round of shots. Then more shots. And more
shots. His FATHER IN LAW watching in disgust.

The Second Mrs. P lunges onto him from out of nowhere--

SECOND MRS. P
Barney! Your father is sitting with
the Rabbi! Go to do something quick!

She SHOVES him toward the table.
RABBI'S TABLE

The Rabbi and the other guests are visibly horrified by Izzy's
anecdotes. Irv, knowing Izzy, loves every minute of it.

IZZY
--so we're shaking down a rub and
tug - I never bust the girls, they
provide a valuable service - but we
do it for appearances. Anyway, we're
doing our thing and one of the clients -
some crazy Hungarian Nazi loaded on
Slivovitz starts going ape shit - he
comes at me with a chair, butt naked
with a hard-on like a can of hairspray--

IRV
Iz, maybe you should tone it down a
little.

IZZY

What, like they've never heard about
such things?

RABBI
Mr. Panosfky, there are ladies present.

IZZY
C'mon Rabbi, everyone knows The
Almighty tests the Jewish man with
two great temptations: shiksas and
bacon.

BARNEY
Dad, can I steal you away for a minute?

IZZY
Don't anybody move. I'll be right back.

As Barney escorts Izzy away, the ENTIRE TABLE, except for
Irv, disperses.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

IZZY
Nice bunch of folks here tonight.
I thought they'd all be snobby but
I'm actually having a hell of a time.
What are you laughing at?

BARNEY
Come here.

Barney gives his father a big hug. At this moment he couldn't
love him more. But then...

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Dad, what's in your pocket?

IZZY
I almost forgot.

Izzy takes Barney to a quiet corner

IZZY (CONT'D)
Your wedding present.

From inside his jacket, Izzy pulls out a GUN In Hanukkah
wrapping paper.
WHITE 10-23-09 41.

IZZY (CONT'D)
My first gun. I want you to have it.

BARNEY
I don't know what to say.

IZZY
Say thank you and get us a drink

BARNEY
Thank you.

They walk to the bar. Slide out their glasses for refills.

BARTENDER
Your father-in-law said that neither
of you was to have any more to drink

Barney grabs a bottle himself and refills their glasses.

BARNEY
Where is that asshole?

IZZY
Barney, don't embarrass me.

Barney stomps off, pushing through the crowd. Gets his father
in law in his sights. Just as he is about to reach him,
something catches his eye that stops him in his tracks.

BARNEY POV

ACROSS THE ROOM - MIRIAM GRANT (28), Gorgeous, classy,
striking eyes. Barney is mesmerized.

FATHER IN LAW (0.S.)
Barney? Can I help you?

BARNEY
Uh, no, forget it...

Barney turns away, but then cuts right back --

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Don't ever tell my father what he
can or cannot do again.

FATHER IN LAW
He traumatized the Rabbi's wife--

BARNEY
I don't care if he fingered her under
the table. He's my father and he'll
have your respect.
WHITE 10-23-09 42.
Father-In-Law is speechless.

And Barney sets out again for Miriam.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

He emerges from a cluster of guests and spots Miriam. She's
chatting with a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN (JEFF) who excuses himself
and goes to the bar. Barney walks right up to her.

BARNEY
We haven't met yet. I'm Barney.

MIRIAM
I'm Miriam. Thank you for having me.

Barney is like a nervous and awkward teenager, not to mention
really drunk.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Are you alright?

BARNEY
Fine. Perfect.

MIRIAM
I understand you're in television.

BARNEY
Totally Unnecessary Productions.

MIRIAM
That's a little harsh.

BARNEY
That's the name of my company.

She laughs. That's something he can never tire of. Miriam
notices the UNLIT cigar he's holding.

MIRIAM
Your cigar is out.

BARNEY
Oh, that's okay, I wouldn't want it
to bother you.

MIRIAM
Please, It's a Montecristo.

She grabs a box of matches from the table. As she lights
his cigar and talks it's as if the whole world around him
has disappeared. The entire moment incredibly intimate.
WHITE 10-23-09 43.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Do you know why they're called
Montecristo's?

BARNEY
Not a clue.

MIRIAM
Fine cigars are all still rolled by
hand. The workers who perform this
task are called "torcedores", and
they all chip in from their own wages
to employ 'lectors' - people who
read them stories as they work.
Entertainment to make the day pass
better. At the factory which produces
this Montecristo, the workers favorite
story was, you guessed it, the Count
of said name.

BARNEY
Lectors.

MIRIAM
Nice touch, don't you think?

He's utterly smitten. Over her shoulder he spots the
Bartender waving to get his attention the score now 1-1.

BARNEY
YES.
MIRIAM
What is it?
BARNEY
Nothing. The hockey game.
MIRIAM
Who's winning?
BARNEY
Habs just tied it up. You follow
hockey?
MIRIAM

No, but I do read newspapers.

BARNEY
Are you doing anything later? Wwe
can still catch the flight to Rome.
Lunch at Dal Bolognese on the Piazza
del Popolo.
WHITE 10-23-09 44.

MIRIAM
The bride may take issue with that.
Anyway, I have to catch my train
back to New York later

She nods, and with perfect manners, rises and extends her hand.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Congratulations again.

He stands, takes her hand and would never let go if she didn't
take it back. He stares at her walking away until--

SECOND MRS. P (0.S.)
Barney?

The Second Mrs. P directly behind him.

BARNEY
Yes!

SECOND MRS. P
I see you met Miriam. She's sucha
snob that one, don't you find?

BARNEY
Yeah - sure - no - why?

SECOND MRS. P
She went to McGill with me, works in
radio now. The kind who subscribes to
The Economist then buys Vogue off the
stand. Now come explain to Judy and
Leon that you don't make pornography.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

LATER

Barney downs yet another Scotch. His tie loose around his
neck, he's drunk and looks miserable. Boogie sits beside
him, wiping his sniffling, coked-up nose.

BARNEY
Thanks for being here, Boogie.

BOOGIE
I'll never miss any of your weddings.

They knock glasses.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)
Oh, I almost forgot.

Boogie rifles through his pockets then hands Barney a NOTE.
WHITE 10-23-09 45.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)
Classy dame. Smart as a whip too.

BARNEY
Who?

Boogie points Barney across the room to MIRIAM. She has her
coat on and is walking out with the Handsome Young Man.

INSERT - HANDWRITTEN NOTE
"CANADIENS 2 BRUINS 1 IN OVERTIME. CONGRATULATIONS. MIRIAM."

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Boogie, for the first time in my
life I am truly, seriously,
irretrievably in love.

The Second Mrs. P appears behind him, draping her arms around
his neck.

SECOND MRS. P
Oh Barney, so am I. So am I.

EXT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - NIGHT

Barney darts out of the Ritz Hotel and jumps into a taxi.
It's raining. Cars are honking, people pouring out into the
streets to celebrate their Hockey team's victory. Traffic
is at a standstill so Barney hops back out and decides to go
by foot.

INT. CENTRAL TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Barney, soaking wet, sprints down the stairs into the station.
He sees the FLASHING LIGHT indicating the entrance to the

NEW YORK CITY PLATFORM, where a porter is checking passengers
tickets. Thinking fast on his feet, Barney hurtles down the
UPWARD rolling escalator to sneak onto the platform.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

Barney makes his way through the train, passing from car to
car, looking for Miriam... whom he finally spots.

She's wearing her reading glasses, engrossed in a novel.
Barney takes a moment just to watch her. Just being able to
look at her makes him feel good.

He drops into the seat next to her. She's stunned.

BARNEY
I like you with glasses.

She takes them off. Shuts her book - Herzog by Saul Bellow.
WHITE 10-23-09 46.

MIRIAM
What are you doing here?!
BARNEY
Run away with me.
MIRIAM
What?
BARNEY

Run away with me, or stay with me,
or I'll go with you--

MIRIAM
Are you out of your mind?!

BARNEY
I'm heels over head, bent over
backwards in love with you--

CONDUCTOR (0.S.)
Leaving Montreal in two minutes!

MIRIAM
How can you say you're in love with
me? We just met - on your WEDDING NIGHT.

Barney grins from ear to ear, overtaken by an unfamiliar
sense of euphoria.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
This isn't funny! Get off this train
right now.

Every word he says - every breath between every word -
completely sincere and sober:

BARNEY
I can't believe this really happens.
It really does, just like that. And
I don't care if it happened on my
wedding night, at a funeral, on my
death bed. It's happened.

Beat.

CONDUCTOR (0.S.)
I.D., tickets.

Miriam hands over her documents to the conductor

BARNEY
I don't have I.D. or a ticket.
WHITE 10-23-09 47.

CONDUCTOR
Then you'll have to get off the train.

MIRIAM
Go home, Barney. Among other things,
sobriety and regret are anxiously
waiting up for you.

Barney finally concedes. He stands - the train LURCHES
forward as it begins to pull out.

BARNEY
You look fantastic in that dress.

Barney gets off the train.
INT. TRAIN PLATFORM - NIGHT

Barney runs along with the train as it picks up speed. Miriam
sits at the window, but won't look at him.

But then her eyes turn to Barney, watching him still chasing
after her, unconcerned with how utterly foolish he appears --
and she smiles at him.

That smile is enough to melt his heart. He runs faster -
into a flat-out sprint trying to get back on and then--

TRIPS and falls HARD onto the concrete platform.
INT. THE SECOND MRS. P'S PARENTS MANSION - NIGHT

The door opens revealing Barney - he's a mess. Ripped pants,
bloody knee and palms.

FATHER IN LAW
We thought you were dead.

Whether that was concern or hope is unclear.

Barney steps inside. The Second Mrs. P runs out and wraps
herself around him.

SECOND MRS. P
Oh my God, are you okay? We thought
you were dead!! We called the police,
the hospitals, I was so ferklempt
Dr. Stein gave me a half a Valium--

THUD. Everyone falls silent. THE GUN has fallen out of
Barney's jacket onto the floor. Oops.

CUT TO:
WHITE 10-23-09 48.
EXT. PIAZZA DI SPAGNA - ROME - DAY

On their honeymoon, Barney and The Second Mrs. P are walking
through the shopping district adjacent to the Spanish Steps.
The Second Mrs. P trying to manage a huge fold-out map of
Rome. Barney is morose and ill-tempered.

BARNEY
Could you put that away please? It's
our honeymoon not a travel junket.

SECOND MRS. P
I'm embarrassing you?

BARNEY
Yes.

SECOND MRS. P
Like with the bidet?

BARNEY
You didn't have to ask the concierge.
I could have told you what it was for.

SECOND MRS. P
Do you have a Masters degree?

BARNEY
No.

SECOND MRS. P
Am I embarrassed?

She stares him down for a moment.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
Snap out of it. We came to Rome to
have fun not mourn the death of your
first wife.

She yanks him into a LINGERIE STORE. That perks him up
slightly.

CUT TO:
INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - HOTEL - ROME - DAY

The Second Mrs. P models her acquisitions for a bored Barney
as she talks long distance to her mother.

SECOND MRS. P

already stuffed three bars in my
suitcase for you...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - HOTEL - ROME - DAY

The Second Mrs. P cuts the labels off her designer clothes
while on the phone to her mother. Barney lays on the bed
reading the sports section of the International Herald Tribune.

SECOND MRS. P

(into phone)
--It's from Dior. I wore it today
and boy did I turn a lot of heads.
I'm going to wear it to temple on
the high holidays. Arlene will die
on the spot... Barney only likes
going shopping when I'm buying
lingerie... What's wrong with that?
Would you prefer he be like cousin
Cyril?... Ma, they banned Cyril
from the men's locker room at the
Y.M.H.A... I'm just saying... Okay,
sure, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Okay, tell Daddy I love him, I'll
talk to you tomorrow.

She hangs up and starts putting away the day's purchases.

BARNEY
I was just thinking about the wedding.

SECOND MRS. P
It was beautiful wasn't it?

BARNEY
Lots of relatives.

SECOND MRS. P
Well, we do have a big family.

BARNEY
You certainly do.
(beat)
Who was that guy from Chicago?

SECOND MRS. P
My cousin Isaac?

BARNEY
Right.
(MORE)
WHITE 10-23-09 50.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
And what about that girl, I think
she was from New York, the one in
the blue dress...

SECOND MRS. P
Miriam Grant.

BARNEY
Right. Who was she again?

SECOND MRS. P
She was a few years behind me at
McGill. I didn't even invite her.
My cousin Jeff brought her.

She gets onto the bed beside him.

BARNEY
Jeff seems gay.

SECOND MRS. P
Jeff is gay. He just pretends for

the family.
BARNEY
Oh good.
Beat.
SECOND MRS. P
Good?
BARNEY
(covering)

Better he should live a lie than
inconvenience your family.

(gets under bedspread)
I'm going to take a quick nap before
dinner.

SECOND MRS. P
Nap? I don't think so.

The Second Mrs. P slides underneath the covers and starts
going down -- but then POPS back up.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
Did you wash it like I asked?

BARNEY
Yeah.

SECOND MRS. P
With soap?
WHITE 10-23-09 51.

BARNEY
Yes.

SECOND MRS. P
Okay.

She dives back under and starts in again. It's like enduring
a highly invasive procedure.

CUT TO:
EXT. MONTREAL STREET - BOOKSTORE - DAY - PRESENT DAY
BACK TO PRESENT DAY.
Hurrying down the street, Barney passes a BOOKSTORE where a
new biography of CLARA CHAMBERS is prominently featured in
the window display. The familiar ink drawing she made of
Barney drawn as Satan, gracing its cover.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS
KATE is already waiting in line. Barney squeezes through

the crowd, accidentally bumping the young woman standing
behind them without apologizing. We'll call her ORGANI-GIRL.

BARNEY

Sorry, I'm late. I took a cab.
KATE

That's okay, I just got here.
BARNEY

And how are you, my favorite

offspring?
KATE

To tell you the truth - perplexed.
BARNEY

By what?
KATE

By you.

(to cashier)
Two double espressos.

(to Barney)
You do something awful, but instead
of trying to make up for it, you opt
for something infinitely worse.

BARNEY
What are you talking about?
WHITE 10-23-09 52.

KATE
Are you kidding?

BARNEY
I'm really not.

ORGANI -GIRL
(leaning in)
My father does the same thing.

KATE
Doesn't it make you crazy?

ORGANI-GIRL
They just don't listen to anything--

BARNEY
(to Organi-Girl)
Hey, flaxseed - this - is not going
to happen. No crazies today.
(to Kate)
Continue.

KATE
Dad, before the recent phone incident
you got Blair a subscription to "Boy
Toy" monthly using his work address.
Before that, you signed him up to an
Al-Queda website. The man still
can't fly out of the country.

BARNEY
I've upset Claire, haven't I?

KATE
You've upset Mom. Blair is too much
of a chicken shit to say anything.

BARNEY
(kissing her cheek)
You are truly my proudest achievement.

They get their coffees and walk to the door.

KATE
My point is, it's time to lay off
Blair.

BARNEY

He stole her from me.

KATE
No he didn't. You got divorced.
She got remarried.
WHITE 10-23-09 53.
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

KATE
There was no one rooting for a
comeback more than I was, but it's
time to let it go. They're happily
married. I'm sorry.

BARNEY
They're married. Stick to the facts.

KATE
An apology wouldn't hurt either.

BARNEY
Apologize to who?

Kate gives up.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Why don't you come up to the cottage
this weekend?

KATE
Actually, I have a date.

BARNEY
Nice boy?
KATE
No, he's a nasty piece of work.
BARNEY
Funny.
KATE

He's very nice. We'll see. It's
our third date and I'm not bored
silly or madly in love. I like him.
I think that's a sign of maturity.

Barney stops walking. Looks around. Confused.

KATE (CONT'D)

What?
BARNEY
Where did I park my car?
KATE
You took a cab.
BARNEY
Right.

Well, I definitely need a weekend in
the country.

INT/EXT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - MONTREAL BRIDGE - DAY

Barney drives out of the city. The gorgeous Montreal skyline
behind him.

INT/EXT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Barney drives along a country road toward his cottage.
EXT. DECK - COTTAGE - NIGHT

Barney is relaxing on the deck of his lakeside cottage. A
Montecristo, Macallan's, reading "THE LIFE OF HEINRICH HEINE"

A RUSTLING comes from the woods. Barney looks up but it's
pitch black out there. Probably a squirrel.

Something RUSTLES again, this time a little closer. Barney
stands, leans on the wood railing, trying to see through the
darkness. Waiting for something to appear. Hoping.

From a distance, he hears the faint sound of a TWIN ENGINE
AIRPLANE approaching. The sound carries over to --

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. TV SOUNDSTAGE - DAY - PAST (1978)

A young Solange is acting in a scene staged in an obviously
fake mock-up of an AIRPLANE COCKPIT SET. We now see why she
was originally hired; she's a total knockout.

Wearing a tight, low cut outfit, she's tending to O'MALLEY
who has a small cut on his forehead.

O'MALLEY
Thank you, nurse.

SOLANGE
Thank you for landing us safely,
Constable.

O'MALLEY
Hopefully the weather will be more
forgiving next time I pass through.

SOLANGE
Well you can be sure my landing strip
will be cleared for you.
WHITE 10-23-09 55.

DIRECTOR (0.S.)
CUT! Great, turning around!

Solange immediately bursts into tears. The crew go about
their business.

DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
(to Barney)
What's wrong with Solange?

BARNEY
Her fiancee died in a plane crash.

DIRECTOR
That was over a year ago. Look at
her, you'd think it just--

BARNEY
To let you finish that thought would
be an insult to stupidity.

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT
Barney, there's a call for you. A

Barney BOLTS from his chair.
INT. OFFICE - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

INT. NEW YORK RADIO STATION - OFFICE - SAME TIME
Miriam closes the door to a tiny office for privacy.

MIRIAM
Barney, this has to stop.

INTERCUT

BARNEY
You got my flowers?

MIRIAM
I got the flowers, and the gifts -
every week it's something else. I
don't know where to start with how
inappropriate all this is.

BARNEY
Just skip ahead to where I've already
gone from annoying and inappropriate
to charming and endearing.
WHITE 10-23-09 56.

MIRIAM
You're a married man and I won't be
involved with you in any way.

BARNEY
I know, I'm sorry. Why don't we
talk about it over lunch. I could
be there tomorrow--

MIRIAM
Are you listening to me?
BARNEY
Every word.
MIRIAM

Really? Well, words matter. Actions
matter. They have consequences.

If you want people to take you
seriously, then act accordingly. Do
you understand me, Barney?

BARNEY
Yes.
MIRIAM
What am I saying?
BARNEY
(beat)
"Be great in act, as you have in
thought".
MIRIAM

(surprised)
Well, yes, exactly.

(curt)
I have to go. Stop this nonsense
and focus on your marriage.

BARNEY
I'm so happy you called. Thank you.

Barney smiles, feeling like progress is being made.
EXT. BARNEY AND THE SECOND MRS. P'S HOUSE - MORNING
A nouveau riche house in a nouveau riche neighborhood.
INT. BARNEY AND THE SECOND MRS. P'S HOUSE - MORNING

The furnishings of their home are excessive and overbearing.
There's no doubting it's The Second Mrs. P who decorated it.
WHITE 10-23-09 57.

SHOPPING BAGS from high end department stores stretch along
the entire length of the ground floor hallway.

With the phone tucked to her ear, The Second Mrs. P flutters
about, rearranging knick-knacks.

SECOND MRS. P
(into phone)

--I had a bowl of cottage cheese and
fruit, I'm watching my figure... Ma,
so don't eat bagels if they make you
bloated... No, you have a wonderful
figure for a woman your age.... what
did I say wrong?... Well it's the
only voice I have so if you don't
like it we can start sending each
other telegrams instead...

She's flipping through a stack of framed wall hangings leaning
against a wall, deciding on something to hang. She pulls out
the familiar sketch CLARA made of Barney drawn to look like
Satan. It makes her gag. She carries it into the kitchen--

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Where Barney is reading the sport section with breakfast.

SECOND MRS. P

(re: Clara's Drawing)
Get rid of this filth... No, ma, I
wasn't talking to you... To the king
of Macedonia, who do you think?...
Listen, I have to go, I still have to
vacuum the Broadloom downstairs... I
had to fire the maid... Why? Because
when Barney and I would go out his
father would sneak over and have sex
with her... I know it's disgusting...
Ma, you asked!... Okay, I'll pick you
up at noon. Goodbye.

She hangs up. Looks at Clara's drawing again.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
If you don't throw this out, I will.

BARNEY
I'll bring it up to the country house.

SECOND MRS. P
And make sure your buddy doesn't
throw up all over the place. We
just changed all the carpets.

Barney continues reading - tuning her out completely.
WHITE 10-23-09 58.

SECOND MRS. P (CONT'D)
Barney!

BARNEY
Absolutely.

SECOND MRS. P
Tell me something - you were at the
game last night, do you think the
score somehow changed overnight?

BARNEY
(standing)
I have to get going.

SECOND MRS. P
BARNEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT! !

BARNEY
What's important?

SECOND MRS. P
THIS. Talking. Communicating.
This is what marriage is.

BARNEY
(annoyed)
You don't want Boogie puking all over
the carpets and your mother's bloated.
Does that pretty much cover it?

SECOND MRS. P
Do I talk down to you like that?

BARNEY
I really have to go. See you ina
couple days.

A quick peck on the forehead and he's gone.
EXT. FLEABAG HOTEL - DAY
Barney waits in his car outside a fleabag hotel. Boogie
emerges from the building, high, stumbles toward Barney's
car. He looks like the full-fledged junkie he has become.
His appearance is shocking to Barney.
BOOGIE
Guess I don't qualify for the "you
look great" greeting.

BARNEY
Just get in.

Boogie gets in the car. In bad shape.
WHITE 10-23-09 59.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
I thought you came here to kick.

BOOGIE
C'mon, I was on a fifteen hour flight
I had to fix one more time.
(beat)
I'm really going to kick this time.
A week locked up in the country and
I'll be good as new.

EXT. COTTAGE - DAY

Barney pulls up to the cottage with Boogie passed out in the
front seat. THE SECOND MRS. P is on the porch, drinking
wine, looking very attractive in a tight fitting summer dress.
Barney helps Boogie up the steps.

SECOND MRS. P
I thought I'd surprise you.

BARNEY
Surprise.

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - COTTAGE - DUSK
Barney drops Boogie onto the bed. He's out cold.
INT. DINING ROOM/KITCHEN - COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
Dinner is already laid out. A roast, potatoes, greens.
SECOND MRS. P
Why didn't you tell me this was why
you were coming up here?
BARNEY
He asked me not to tell anyone, and
he needed somewhere safe to kick.

SECOND MRS. P
Yeah, it's called rehab

Barney goes to the bar and fixes himself a drink

BARNEY
Do you want one?

SECOND MRS. P
Just bring the bottle to the table
so you don't have to jump up every
two minutes.
WHITE 10-23-09 60.

BARNEY
Wow, are we ever in for a good time
this weekend.

SECOND MRS. P
You don't know the half of it. Look
what I found while going through
your pockets.

She produces a BILL from 'GRAND FLORISTS'

BARNEY
What about it?

SECOND MRS. P
Well played, no hesitation.

BARNEY
You're going to be very embarrassed
when those show up.

SECOND MRS. P
Stop. I called the florist. While
usually discreet about their clients,
the ray of sunshine that is you left
the manager eager to tell me you
have a standing order of roses to
someone in New York every week.

BARNEY
Jesus Christ. This is ridiculous.
You want to pick through every receipt
I have? I'm not going to stay here
and take this.
Barney storms out to the DECK.
EXT. DECK - COUNTRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
She follows him out.

SECOND MRS. P
Be a man, Barney.

Barney stares out at the lake. He won't look her in the eye.

BARNEY
I've never been unfaithful to you.

SECOND MRS. P
So who are the flowers for?

BARNEY
An actress we're trying to get for a
new pilot.
WHITE 10-23-09 61.

SECOND MRS. P
What's her name?

BARNEY
Can we talk about this in the morning?

SECOND MRS. P

No. I don't understand what you
want anymore. Before we got married
you couldn't keep your hands off me.
Now it's been months since we made
love. You say you've never been
unfaithful, so what is it then?

(softer)
On our wedding night I came up behind
you and you were saying how hopelessly
in love you were. It was the happiest
moment of my life. I keep going
back to that just to have something
to hold onto.

(beat)
What happened? Why did you even marry me?

He can't bring himself to answer her. It hurts her like
hell, but she's not going to cry in front of him.

SECOND MRS. P_ (CONT'D)
I'm so ashamed. And you are such a
liar. Fuck you.
She goes back inside.
EXT. COTTAGE - DAWN

The sound of cicada. The calm of the lake. Barney's cottage
is a true country paradise.

INT. KITCHEN - COTTAGE - MORNING

Wiping the sleep from her eyes, The Second Mrs. P shuffles
into the kitchen and finds a note on the fridge:

"Had to go into town for the day. Call you later - Barney".

SECOND MRS. P

BARNEY
What are you talking about?

IZZY
Maybe you just need to take a step
back before you do anything rash.
Let's take a good, hard look at the
situation. You're married to a well-
bred woman who's loaded, makes a
nice, flaky kugel and has a great
rack. Many successful marriages
were built on far less.

Can we drop this? Just forget I
ever said anything.

IZZY
She's a tough cookie. If you divorce
her, she's gonna take you to the
cleaners.

BARNEY
You know how rich her father is.
She's going to inherit a shitload of
money.

IZZY
And you think that'll stop her from
taking all of yours?

BARNEY
I don't care.

IZZY
Is that so?

BARNEY

Yeah.

Izzy registers the depth of Barney's true feelings.

IZZY
So tell me her name.

BARNEY

Alright then, let's do this.

Barney holds the phone away from his ear as she drones on.
He considers responding, but then just hangs up.

INT/EXT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - COUNTRY ROAD - MORNING

Still hungover, chugging coffee, Barney drives up to the
cottage. The RADIO NEWS tells us it's 8:25 AM.

INT. COTTAGE - MORNING

Barney enters the house. Walks down the hall. Hears noises
coming from the guest bedroom. He opens the door to find...

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The Second Mrs. P, naked, moaning, and riding Boogie in the
midst of hot, hard sex until she sees Barney:

SECOND MRS. P
AAAAAAA! ! !

The Second Mrs. P rolls off Boogie and falls onto the floor
with a cringe worthy THUD.
WHITE 10-23-09 65.

Kicking and screaming, she scrambles to cover herself with

Barney is frozen with shock

SECOND MRS. P
This is all your fault, you bastard,

In tears, she throws on whatever clothes she can find.

I brought him something to eat, he
was trembling, his sheets were soaked,
I only laid down beside him to try
to keep him warm... I still don't
know how he got my nightie off.

BARNEY
It must have been magic, then.

SECOND MRS. P
We shouldn't talk about this now

Tell her we're getting divorced!

She exits.
EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS
She goes toward her car. Barney right behind her
SECOND MRS. P
You tell her yourself! No, don't -
she has a root canal today.
She gets in her car, starts the engine, rolls down the window.
BARNEY
I was coming back to try to work
things out.
SECOND MRS. P
Bullshit. I bet the two of you
perverts arranged this together
BARNEY
Ha! I'm going to kill him for this
then I'll come for you, and just for
kicks, your mother after that!

SECOND MRS. P
Go to hell! Animal!

She drives away, kicking up a cloud of dust in her wake.
INT. DEN - COTTAGE - MORNING

Barney walks in to find Boogie chugging right from a bottle
of Scotch. He's already very drunk.

BARNEY
I should kill you for this.

BOOGIE
What you should have done was call first.

Boogie pours Barney a glass, who reticently takes it.

BARNEY
How could you do that to me?
WHITE 10-23-09 67.

BOOGIE
She did it to me. It was innocent
enough to start with - she brought
me something to eat, started talking -
you know how that goes - tells me
how you've been shirking your
husbandly duties, que sera sera...

BARNEY
So you fucked her?

BOOGIE
It was the only thing that would
shut her up.

Boogie shakes the empty Scotch bottle at Barney.

BARNEY
Check the dining room. I'm going to
need you to do something for me.
Testify that I came home to you in
bed with my wife.

BOOGIE
You sly bastard - you planned this
all along.

BARNEY

Who could plan this?

BOOGIE (0.S.)
I don't see any Scotch, but look
here...

Boogie comes back up with an open WOOD BOX containing the
GUN from Izzy. He takes it out, waves it around.

BOOGIE (CONT'D)

What do you say? Duel at high noon?
But I don't think we have enough
booze to get us there.

Barney grabs the gun away from Boogie.
BARNEY
That's loaded, shmuck. There's more
Scotch in the kitchen.
INT. DEN - COTTAGE - LATER

Ice is dropped into two tumblers. More Scotch poured.
They've gone through half the bottle and are visibly drunk

Boogie peruses Barney's book collection. He picks up Clara's
sketch that's leaning against the wall.
WHITE 10-23-09 68.

BOOGIE
Did you hear they named a new
auditorium at Barnard after her?
Crazy Clara Chambers - she wasn't
too bad a poet, actually.
I bet this is worth a pretty penny
now. Hey, who gets the residuals
from her books?

BARNEY
I signed the rights over to charity
right after she died. Listen, will
you testify or not?

BOOGIE
I'll think about it.

BARNEY
You know what? It's time you came
through for me for once.

BOOGIE
Really?

BARNEY
How many times have I bailed you out
over the years?

BOOGIE
I wasn't counting.

BARNEY
Neither was I.

BOOGIE
You sure about that?

BARNEY
When I had nothing, I borrowed for
you. You owe me.

BOOGIE
Well isn't this getting interesting.
But I'd like to go for a swim and
think it over. You must have a
snorkel and flippers here.

Boogie grabs the bottle of Scotch and heads to the sunroom.
Barney follows him out, the gun still in his sweater pocket.

EXT. SUNROOM - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Boogie rifles through a trunk and finally comes up with a
SNORKEL, MASK AND FLIPPERS.
WHITE 10-23-09 69.

BARNEY
How's your novel coming along?
BOOGIE
Are you asking as a friend or an
investor?
BARNEY
Both.
BOOGIE

I'm still working on it.

BARNEY
You're a fraud.

BOOGIE
Oh, have I let poor Barney down?

BARNEY
Yeah, you have.

BOOGIE
Too fucking bad. You know what,
man? I brought you in. I educated
you. I put the right books in your
hands, and look what you've become.
A TV hustler, married to a rich man's
vulgar daughter.

BARNEY
Not so vulgar that you wouldn't bang her.

BOOGIE
And she wasn't the only wife of yours
I had. Next time I'm in New York
I'll call on your tart and make it a
trifecta.

Boogie pushes through the screen door
EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Boogie staggers toward the dock, drunk and barely able to
walk a straight line.

BARNEY
FUCK YOU.

Barney CHARGES Boogie. They start to wrestle but are too
drunk to really take it anywhere serious. They break apart
winded and woozy.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
What happened to you?
WHITE 10-23-09 70.

BOOGIE
Nothing. Absolutely nothing happened
to me; and that's what you take as a
personal offense. I am not your pet
project. Not your vicarious life.
Not your hope.

BARNEY
Not my friend?

Boogie doesn't even think to answer. He just swigs from the
bottle again.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Do you realize you haven't come close
to giving me an apology?

BOOGIE

Let me recommend another book to stock
your shelf with; "The Life of Heinrich
Heine", who upon his death bed was
begged by his loved ones to ask for
God's forgiveness before he passed.

But good old Heinrich had only this

to say: "God will surely forgive me -
after all, that's his fucking job".

BARNEY
Don't count on it.

BOOGIE
I'm going for a swim.

Boogie slips on the flippers, waddles onto the dock

BARNEY
Boogie, stop! You're too drunk and
you can barely swim anyway. I'll
shoot, you prick, I will!

Barney fires a WARNING SHOT straight up into the air.

BOOGIE
There you go!
But this time shoot it at me you
fucking coward! See for yourself
what's really inside this mossy,
dampened cavity you think is a heart.
C'mon, do it!

Barney stares him down. A silent rage boiling inside. Boogie
grins, snaps on the goggles and the snorkel, spreads his
arms wide, tilts his head back...
WHITE 10-23-09 71.

BARNEY
Don't you fucking move.

Barney drunkenly staggers forward, pointing the gun at Boogie --

AND THIS ALL HAPPENS IN HAZY FLASH: Barney TRIPS -- the gun
FIRES -- Boogie lets himself FALL backward into the lake.

It appears the gun fired into the air, but he could have easily
fired in Boogie's direction. We can't be sure.

Barney turns and heads back up into the house. We DO NOT
see Boogie resurface.

INT. DEN - COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Barney stumbles in.

Barney hits the bottle hard - one shot after another.

The bottle now empty. Barney's passed out on the sofa.

Barney on the floor, woken by the the RUMBLING of a TWIN ENGINE
AIRPLANE, starting from a distance and approaching fast.

miles east.

DETECTIVE SEAN O'HEARNE, younger, slimmer, healthier than we
know him to be, steps up along side Barney.

O'HEARNE (CONT'D)
Twenty cottages burned so far

BARNEY
They're wasting their time out there.
I told them I looked all over the
lake in my boat. He's broken into a
cottage, emptied it of all the booze
and pills he could find and moved on.

O' HEARNE
But he leaves his clothes and wallet
here?

BARNEY

He took someone else's clothes.
O' HEARNE
No break-ins have been reported.
Got something to drink?
INT. KITCHEN - COTTAGE - MORNING

Barney opens the refrigerator and passes O'Hearne a cold beer
O'Hearne saunters through the house, sipping the beer

He stops at the FRAMED SKETCH BY CLARA leaning against the wall.

O' HEARNE
That's kind of sick.

BARNEY
My first wife made that.

O' HEARNE
(taking out notepad)
Oh yeah? What's her name?

BARNEY
She's dead.

O' HEARNE
Did you catch her fucking someone
too?

BARNEY

She killed herself.

O' HEARNE
Beat you to it, I guess.
WHITE 10-23-09 73.

BARNEY
What the fuck does that mean? I
called you guys.

O' HEARNE
Yeah, you did. So why didn't you
mention this gun?

O'Hearne pulls out Barney's GUN, in a plastic evidence bag.
BARNEY

My dad is a retired cop. He gave it
to me for protection.

O' HEARNE
(dawning)
Are you fuckin' Izzy Panofsky's kid?
BARNEY
Yes.
O' HEARNE
No shit. So why are there two rounds
missing?
BARNEY

Boogie and I were horsing around.

O' HEARNE
By shooting off rounds?

BARNEY
We were drunk.

O' HEARNE
This was after you caught him fucking
your wife?

BARNEY
It wasn't like that.

O' HEARNE
You shot off the rounds before you
walked in on them screwing?

BARNEY
No.

O' HEARNE
After.

BARNEY

Yes.
WHITE 10-23-09 74.

O' HEARNE
So you did shoot him.

BARNEY
Yeah, right through his fucking heart,
Jesus Christ--

O' HEARNE
(take notes)
Now we're getting somewhere.

BARNEY
Are you a complete idiot? Why are
you wasting your time here? Go find
him! Have you thought that he might
be hurt somewhere?

O' HEARNE
And what about this piece of ass you're
keeping in New York - the florist
gave us her name - Miriam Grant...

Barney grabs O'Hearne --

BARNEY
You keep her out of this--

O'Hearne drives a knee into his groin, then lays one into
Barney's face, sending him to the floor

O' HEARNE
Two bullets shot from your gun just
after you caught your best friend
banging your wife. You threatened
to kill them both, and now he's
missing. Unless you ate him, we'll
find the body before sundown. So
tell me where the body is and I'll
say you were cooperative and
remorseful, you'll get yourself a
smart Jew lawyer and be out in no
time. No one cares about a useless
junkie anyway.

Barney lifts himself to one knee.

BARNEY
Go to hell.

O'Hearne kicks him in the gut once, then again, when...
IZZY grabs O'Hearne from behind and throws him off Barney.

O' HEARNE
What are you doin' here, Panofsky?
WHITE 10-23-09 75.

IZZY
I got a call from my son.

O' HEARNE
Very sweet, but he attacked an officer
of the law.

IZZY
From where I'm standing this looks
like police brutality.

O' HEARNE
Like you're one to talk.

IZZY
You leave your hands off him.

O' HEARNE
He's goin' down for murder.

IZZY
Really? It seems those razor-sharp
detective skills of yours missed one
tiny detail; you don't have a body.
Now you got anything else to say,
talk to his lawyer.

O'Hearne exits. Izzy kneels to look at Barney's face.

IZZY (CONT'D)
So, did you do it?

Alright, alright. Let me get you

Alphonse Daudet..." Barney drops his pen. This is idiotic.
He starts pacing. Then dials the concierge.

Barney splashes his face with water, pats himself dry. Looks
at himself in the mirror. Takes a deep breath.

From the bathroom, he walks a short corridor back into the

Did you want to order now?

MIRIAM

BARNEY

Of course, take your time.

(to waiter)
Just the Champagne. And some Beluga.
The Iranian stuff, the Russian is
too salty...

It is hot in here...

Barney opens his collar. Perspiration forming on his brow.

MIRIAM
Are you okay?

BARNEY
I'm great. There's so much I want
to talk about... Oh, I know - have

you read, uh, what's it called...
give me a second--

BARNEY
Of course I did.

MIRIAM
You hardly know me.

Wonderful, now we can celebrate.

What would you like to talk about -
All The President's Men, Herzog or
Alphonse Daudet - nice reference, by

BARNEY
I'm an idiot.

MIRIAM
Don't be so modest. You obviously
expected me to come up to your room.

BARNEY
Never.

MIRIAM
So the champagne and roses are for
another woman?

Barney lifts his throbbing head to see for himself. Sure
enough there's two bottles of champagne and two dozen roses.

BARNEY
Oh God...

He covers his face and begins to MOAN. Miriam finds it all
utterly amusing. She pries his hands from his face.

MIRIAM
Why don't you get cleaned up, we'll
get some fresh air, and maybe a slice
of pizza. I'm absolutely starving.

Off Barney's delight --
EXT. STREET - CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

They stroll along the park. Barney rambles on, desperately
trying to keep Miriam engaged. He hardly even breathes
between words.

BARNEY
--"The Big Apple" is actually an old
racetrack term, credited to John
Fitzgerald - a sports writer for the
herald in the 30's. He'd heard old
stable hands from Mississippi use it
when referring to the New York
racetracks. Getting to race in New
York was considered hitting the big
time - getting a bite of that "Big
Apple" and I'm just going to keep
talking because I'm afraid if I stop

I don't want it to happen. Ever.

And then he finally just runs out of steam. They stop walking
and face each other for what seems like an eternity to him.

MIRIAM
There it was. The pause.
BARNEY
Yeah.

MIRIAM

I'm still here.
EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

They walk along the East River. Their body language now
more intimate.

sleeping with every factory girl he
could get on the side.

It killed my mother. That's what
gave her cancer.

That's a bit unfair.

MIRIAM
No, it's not. It devastated every
part of her. Mind and body. Heart

to me.

BARNEY
I would never do that to you.

MIRIAM
I want one thing from you.

BARNEY
Anything.
WHITE 10-23-09 83.

MIRIAM
See, that's what scares me about
you. Don't answer ‘anything’. That's

not real, and life is real. It's
made up of little things - minutes
and hours and errands and naps and
routine, and that has to be enough.
After all you've done to pursue me,
how can I ever trust you?

BARNEY
That's a reasonable question.

Barney thinks hard. He knows he needs to come up with
something good. Then he rifles through his pocket and pulls
out a CIGAR CLIPPER. He SNAPS it shut for effect.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
I'll cut it off. Right away.

MIRIAM
Now you're offering to be my eunuch?

BARNEY
Like I said, I'll do anything for
you, Miriam.

Michael (12) and Kate (9) play frisbee by the lake with Miriam.
The sun is setting. The sky a perfect orange hue.

Barney looks out at the stunning landscape, his children
and his gorgeous wife.

He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, holding onto this
moment of perfection.

He opens his eyes. Izzy's watching him. Barney expects a

Izzy puffs away on his cigar, leaving it at that.

Barney riding in a yellow cab with a bag from SCHWARTZ'S on
the seat beside him. He sees a young couple kissing in the
same spot where he and Miriam first kissed.

CUT TO:
INT. MICHAEL'S LOFT - BROOKLYN - NIGHT

Barney and Michael watch a hockey game together. Barney is
yelling at the TV, halfway through a bottle of Scotch and
smoking a cigar. The table littered with remnants of a meal
from Schwartz's Smoked Meat.

BARNEY
(yelling at TV)
Useless goddamn pansy ref, get your
head out of your ass!!

Caroline enters - business suit, briefcase. A belligerent
Barney coupled the disorderly mess of the apartment is the
last thing she wanted to end her day with. Michael greets
her at the door.

CAROLINE
I thought you were going out for
dinner.

MICHAEL

(apologetic) )
Dad brought in smoked meat from
Montreal.

CAROLINE
(to Michael)
Didn't we agree to no cigars in the
house?

Barney looks to Michael for backup, but is met with silence.
He grudgingly taps out the cigar.

BARNEY
Am I still allowed to use the bathroom
or would you prefer I leave my
business in paper bags by the door?
Recyclable ones, of course.

CAROLINE
Turn that down please, I have to get
up early.

She heads off to the bedroom. Michael scowls at Barney.
WHITE 10-23-09 90.

BARNEY
What? The woman hates me.

MICHAEL
Maybe she wouldn't hate you if you
didn't behave like a child.

BARNEY
Chicken and the egg.

MICHAEL
No, dad, it's not. You can't keep
acting this way. Not with us, or
Mom and Blair.

BARNEY
So you're speaking for your mother now?

MICHAEL
Just leave them alone already. She's
not coming back to you.

BARNEY
If that's what you're so angry about,
then fine. Tell your mother from this
moment on she is forgotten. Erased.
Nothing but a wisp of gray on the
otherwise full, dark mane of my life.

MICHAEL
I'm sure she'll appreciate the sentiment
if not the poetry. Good-night.

Michael starts to walk out--

BARNEY
Michael...
MICHAEL
What?
BARNEY
What have you told her about me?
MICHAEL
I tell her everything. That's what
couples do.
BARNEY

Spare me the sermon. I see the way
she looks at me.

MICHAEL
What are you talking about?
WHITE 10-23-09 91.

BARNEY

I saw O'Hearne's book on her night
table. She can't even be bothered
to hide it from me. How could you
let her read that? She even has all
these pages dog-eared in it...

(beat)
When she asks about Boogie, what do
you tell her?

Michael doesn't answer

Barney readies himself for one of the hardest things he's
ever had to ask.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Do you think I could have possibly
done that?
Beat.

MICHAEL
Only you really know.

Michael exits. That devastates Barney. He simply deflates.

From outside, a CAR ALARM has begun to whine. Its incessant
squeal turns into --

FLASHBACK TO:

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT - PAST
(2000)

A KETTLE WHISTLING.

Barney pours two cups of tea. Then smells a jar of HONEY,
not sure if it's still good.

INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS

Barney carries the tea and honey on a tray. Miriam is on
the sofa watching a NEWS MAGAZINE PROGRAM.

MIRIAM
(re: on TV)
That's Taylor Gates.

BARNEY
(re: honey)
Tell me if this is still good.
WHITE 10-23-09 92.

MIRIAM
She was my intern before we got
married. She could barely string
two words together.

Miriam drips the honey into her tea without smelling it. She
passes it to Barney who is still not convinced it's edible.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Honey doesn't go bad.

BARNEY
Ever?

MIRIAM
Archeologists found honey in Egyptian
tombs thousands of years old and it
was still edible.

Barney shrugs, uses the honey. Miriam curls herself into
the corner of the sofa, feeling depressed.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Everyone seems to be doing pretty
interesting things nowadays.

BARNEY
Giving birth and raising two amazing
children is pretty interesting.

MIRIAM
But it doesn't command much respect
now does it?

BARNEY
Miriam- -

MIRIAM
It doesn't matter.

Miriam grabs a magazine from the coffee table, shutting down
the conversation.

EXT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Autumn. Michael (now 18) and a few buddies have loaded the
last of his things into a small U-Haul. It's off to college.

MIRIAM
(crying)
My baby.

MICHAEL
Mom, I'm not going to war. I'll be
back for thanksgiving.
WHITE 10-23-09 93.
She kisses Michael one last time.

MIRIAM
Okay, I'm going inside.

MICHAEL
(to Barney)
Any last words of wisdom?

BARNEY
You need money, ask me. Don't start
selling dope.
MICHAEL
No selling dope. Got it. Anything
else?
Barney takes him in his arms.

BARNEY
I love you.

MICHAEL
I love you too, dad.

A quick goodbye to Kate (16).

KATE
Take care of yourself.

Michael jumps into the truck, starts to pull out.

BARNEY
Pull over if you get tired!

EXT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL GARDEN - DAY

Barney and Miriam having lunch out in the lush, beautiful
garden of the Ritz.

Miriam stares absently at her plate. Her mind elsewhere.
She sets down her cutlery. Her food only half eaten.

BARNEY

He had to move out eventually.
MIRIAM

I know. That's not it.

(beat)
I want to go back to work. I've been
thinking about this for a while.
Blair said he can get me freelance
work. It's just research and writing
for now but it could lead to other
things. Maybe even on air.
WHITE 10-23-09 94.

BARNEY
And I'm sure Blair will do everything
he can for you.

MIRIAM
Stop that.
BARNEY
(beat)
Are you unhappy?
MIRIAM
No. Not in the way you're trying to
get at.
BARNEY

Then in which way?
JEAN THE MAITRE'D comes over.

JEAN
How is everything?

MIRIAM
Excellent, as always.

JEAN
May I get you anything else?

BARNEY
We're fine. Thank you, Jean.

Jean leaves. Barney sulks, polishing off his wine.

MIRIAM
I knew how you would take this.

BARNEY
It's just that I've worked this hard
so you wouldn't ever have to. So you
could be here with the kids and me.
We both agreed that was important.

MIRIAM

It was important. But Michael's
gone, soon Kate will be too, and
you're as grown up as you'll ever
be. Where does that leave me? I
need more stimulation in my life. I
have to believe I can be something
other than just a wife and mother.

BARNEY
I'll quit working.
(MORE )
WHITE 10-23-09 95.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
We'll retire early, travel, go to
Italy, get a Villa on Lake Como.

MIRIAM
You can't just fix this like you do
everything else. I don't want you to.
(beat)
I need to do this. Can you try and
understand?

BARNEY
Of course. Whatever you want to do,
I'm behind it. A hundred percent.
He fakes through the deep panic he's feeling inside.
INT. CBC RADIO STATION - BOOTH - NIGHT
Miriam interviews a distinguished looking man on the air
MIRIAM
...Well, Mr. Dalhousie, that's all
the time we have. Thank you so much
for coming in.

GUEST
It is was a pleasure. Thank you.

The ON AIR light turns OFF. Miriam lets out a big sigh of
relief. The staff on the other side of the glass APPLAUD.

INT. CBC RADIO STATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Miriam walks down the Hall with BLAIR.

MIRIAM
I hope that wasn't too painful.

BLAIR
Are you kidding? It was fantastic.

MIRIAM
Stop it, Blair.

BLAIR
Really, Miriam, you're a natural.

MIRIAM
Thank you. Would you excuse me, I'm
going to call Barney.

BLAIR
Of course.

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The phone RINGS through an empty house.

INT. GRUMPY'S BAR - NIGHT

Barney is sitting at the bar, watching the hockey game. The
bar ERUPTS at a bad penalty call.

BARNEY
What the hell kind of call is that??!!

INSERT - BARNEY'S CELL PHONE - on the bar, ringing. He
doesn't hear it.

INT. HALLWAY - CBC RADIO STATION - NIGHT
Miriam hangs up. Upset that Barney didn't answer
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Barney tiptoes into the dark, quiet apartment. He's drunk
and trying very hard to be quiet.

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Miriam is already asleep. Barney is about to crawl into bed--

MIRIAM
Where have you been?

Miriam turns on the bedside lamp.

BARNEY
I was at Grumpy's watching the game.

MIRIAM
Did you hear my interview?

BARNEY
I'm sorry, I just lost track of--

MIRIAM
This was important to me. You knew
that right?

BARNEY
(beat)
Yes.

MIRIAM
But you missed my first on air
interview because you were drunk and
watching a hockey game, like you've
done a thousand times before.
WHITE 10-23-09 97.
BARNEY
(beat)
Yes.
MIRIAM
Okay. I wanted to be sure we're
clear on what happened here tonight.
Miriam flips back over and turns the lamp OFF.

BARNEY
Should I sleep on the sofa?

She turns the lamp back ON.
MIRIAM
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're not sleeping on the sofa, we
don't sleep apart. Good night.
She turns the light OFF.
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Barney has accompanied IZZY to his Mother's grave.

IZZY
You got yourself a plot yet?
BARNEY
No.
IZZY
You should get one. The good ones go
fast.

Izzy places a rock on the double headstone:

ESTHER PANOFSKY - 1925 - 1972, Wife to Izzy, Mother to Barney.
Engraved beside hers is Izzy's name: ISRAEL PANOFSKY

BARNEY
You okay?

IZZY
Sure.

But he's not very convincing.

BARNEY
I was thinking, why don't you move
in with us? Now that the kids are
gone we have more than enough space.
WHITE 10-23-09 98.

IZZY
Thanks, but no thanks.

BARNEY
I don't like the thought of you being
alone.

IZZY
I'm not alone. See that? That's alone.

Izzy points to a single grave beside theirs.

IZZY (CONT'D)
Buried alone. No wife. No kids.
That's alone. I'm going to be right
here with your mother.
When you get to my age you'll see
what a comfort that is.

BARNEY
I know it must be hard without her

IZZY
I'm used to being without her. I
need to get laid.

BARNEY
(walking away)
Jesus Christ...

IZZY
What? How long have you ever had to
hold out, Mr. THREE wives!

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A group of Miriam's friends including BLAIR, are over for
dinner. Blair holds court while Barney broods over his Scotch
bored and annoyed with Blair's politically correct discourse.

BLAIR
--I think it's fair to say that in 50
years we'll look back on this time
and our inhumane treatment of animals
for the sake of mass consumption, as
a shameful and barbaric chapter in
our history, much like how we perceive
segregation or McCarthyism- -

Barney can't stand another second of this. He gets up and
brings a cigar back to the table.

MIRIAM
Barney, please don't smoke that.
You know it irritates Blair's asthma.
WHITE 10-23-09 99.
Without a moment's pause, Barney heads out to the den.
EXT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - CONTINUOUS

Barney lights his cigar with great pleasure. The dinner
guests continue with their conversation.

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Barney crawls into bed with a moan. Miriam's reading. Barney
stares at the ceiling, exhausted. Long silence. Miriam
sets down her book.
MIRIAM
If you can't at least be civil with my
friends then don't bother joining us.

BARNEY
I thought I was perfectly civil.

MIRIAM
You fell asleep at the table.

Beat.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
I forgot to ask, how was the cemetery?

BARNEY
Good times.

The phone RINGS. Barney groans. Reaches for the phone.
EXT. MASSAGE PARLOR - NIGHT

A non-descript building with a red neon sign: MASSAGE. Barney
parks right in front, then enters.

INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - RECEPTION - NIGHT

PUSH IN through a beaded curtain and into the waiting room
of an old school "rub and tug" massage parlor.

The Madame, GOLDIE (45) is consoling a working girl, who is
sobbing. Goldie looks up at CAMERA --

GOLDIE
Barney...?

Barney nods. She takes his hand. Barney's eyes searching.
He's at a loss. She takes him by the arm and leads him down
the hall.
WHITE 10-23-09 100.

GOLDIE (CONT'D)
After they finished, the girl left
the room to get a hot towel. When
she went back in... At least he went

happy.

She stops in front of room #4.

GOLDIE (CONT'D)
He talked about you all the time.
You made him so proud.

She opens a door and lets Barney go in --
INT. MASSAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Barney enters, takes in the room. Goldie shuts the door
leaving him alone. The lighting dim. The walls bare. A shelf
with a bottle of baby oil, a box of kleenex.

Izzy's body lays on the table, covered in a white sheet. A
peaceful, half-grin on his face.

Barney sits on a small chair beside the body. He lifts the
edge of the sheet and takes his father's hand in his. He
starts to laugh at the situation, patting his father's hand.
Then he squeezes it tighter, holding it with both his hands
pressing it to his forehead, and starts to cry.

INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - RECEPTION - LATER

Barney exits the room. He sits beside Goldie in the
reception. They share a quiet moment.

GOLDIE
He didn't get a chance to settle up.

 

Beat. Barney reaches into his pocket, hands her a couple
hundred from his wallet.

CUT TO:
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - NIGHT - PRESENT
Barney grabs an ice cube from the freezer for his Scotch.
Before shutting the door he pulls out an ONION - stares at
it quizzically - then puts it back.

BARNEY
You sure you don't want anything?

KATE (0.S.)
No, thanks.
WHITE 10-23-09 101.

Barney goes into the DEN and refills his Scotch before sitting
down to continue his Scrabble game with Kate.

KATE (CONT'D)
It's your turn.

BARNEY
What did you do?

KATE
Right there.

Barney stares at the board. Confused.

KATE (CONT'D)
Dad....?

BARNEY
Sorry.

He sets down his pieces.

KATE
What word is that?

INSERT - SCRABBLE BOARD. His pieces spell: "ATTNY"

BARNEY
Attorney.

KATE
You're missing half the letters.

BARNEY
It's the abbreviation.

KATE
When you get that lazy with cheating,
I know you're tired.
She gets up and starts to clean up.

BARNEY
Leave that, I'll do it.

KATE
No, dad. Let me.

Barney can tell that she needs to keep herself busy. He
takes her arm to stop her and pull her down to sit.

BARNEY
Do you want to talk about it?
WHITE 10-23-09 102.

KATE
I'll be fine. I'm just happy it
only took eight months to realize he
was a jerk.

He pulls her into a comforting embrace. That's all it takes
for her to start crying in his arms.

BARNEY
It'll be okay. I promise.

She cries as long as she needs to.
They break apart, she wipes her eyes on her sleeve.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Let me get you a tissue.

KATE
No, I'll get it.

She gets up to go to the washroom. Barney watches her go.
His eyes drift over and stop on LEO'S PAINTING prominently
displayed on the wall. It's an abstract multi-colored
whirlpool that winds down to a black center. Barney's mind
follows it down to the black nothingness...

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. CBC RADIO STATION - BOOTH - DAY - PAST (2003)

Miriam is interviewing Barney's old friend, LEO FASOLI (61)
He's now a famous painter with an air of success and gravitas
about him.

Barney and Blair watch from the booth, along with Leo's flavor
of the month, a stunning 28 year old BIMBO.

MIRIAM
--and we're back talking with renowned
painter and artist, Leo Fasoli.
Leo, you recently signed a seven
figure deal with Simon and Schuster
to publish your autobiography. But
then you returned the money, saying
you no longer wanted to do it. what
happened?

LEO
It proved to be more difficult than
I originally thought it would be.

MIRIAM
In what way?
WHITE 10-23-09 103.
Leo pauses.

LEO
Andre Gide, the French author, once
said "nothing is as destructive to
happiness as the remembrance of
happiness lost".

EXT. CBC RADIO STATION - DAY

Barney escorts Leo and his Bimbo out. A LIMO waits right
outside the door. Leo lights a cigarette. For all his
success, there's a sense of melancholy to him.

LEO
(to Bimbo)
A spetta un minuto, cara mia.

BIMBO
I love it when you speak Italian.

She gives Leo a kiss, then slips into the limo.
BARNEY
(re: Bimbo)
You like this one?
Leo just shrugs.
BARNEY (CONT'D)

Thanks again for doing the interview.
It's a real coup for Miriam.

LEO
It was my pleasure. She's an amazing
woman.

BARNEY

Are you sure you can't stay the night?
We'd love to have you over.

LEO
There's nothing I would enjoy more
but I have to get back to New York.
They hug.
LEO (CONT'D)
You've made a wonderful life for
yourself. It makes me happy.

Leo gets in the limo and is driven away.

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Blair has joined Barney and Miriam for dinner. Miriam and
Blair enjoy lively conversation, while Barney broods in
silence and polishes off another Scotch.

BLAIR
Allow me a toast to you Barney. You
really came through getting Leo to
do the interview.

MIRIAM
Yes you did. And a toast to Blair
and his new job in New York

BLAIR
I don't have it yet.

BARNEY
Here's hoping.

They drink. Miriam begins to clear the table.

BLAIR
Let me help you.

MIRIAM
Guests don't clean.

Miriam heads to the kitchen. Long silence.

BARNEY
So when are you going to find out?

BLAIR
Probably not for another month.

BARNEY
A month? Jeez, don't be so soft.
Push them. Let them know they'll
lose you if they sit on their asses.

BLAIR
I'm not one to be aggressive like that.

BARNEY
Just because you're gay, doesn't
mean you can't be assertive.

BLAIR
I'm not gay.

BARNEY
I didn't think so, but Miriam--
WHITE 10-23-09 105.

BLAIR
Miriam thinks I'm gay?

BARNEY
I told her you weren't, but--

Miriam enters.

MIRIAM
So what you are boys talking about?

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Miriam kisses Blair good-night.

MIRIAM
Thank you for coming.

BLAIR
Thanks for another incredible meal,
and again, congratulations, it was a
fantastic interview.

MIRIAM
Thanks.

Blair exits. The moment the door closes she puts on her game
face and marches into the...

INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS
...to confront Barney, who is just lighting up a cigar

MIRIAM
What's with you? And don't say
"what?". Let's just skip that whole
part, okay?

BARNEY
I was giving him a few life lessons.

MIRIAM
By telling him I think he's gay?
And who even jokes about that anymore?

BARNEY
I don't want to fight about Cher

MIRIAM
We're not fighting about Blair.
We're fighting about you.

BARNEY
Why?
WHITE 10-23-09 106.

MIRIAM
Getting Leo to come in doesn't negate
all the other interviews you've missed
to get drunk and watch the game, or
all the dinners you've ruined because
you're incorrigible with my friends.

BARNEY
It doesn't?

Miriam is NOT amused.

MIRIAM
I'm going to visit Michael for a
week.

BARNEY
What? When?

MIRIAM
Next weekend.

BARNEY
Okay, I'll take the week off.

MIRIAM
No. I think a little time apart will
do us both good.

BARNEY
What? Where is this coming from?
MIRIAM
We've hardly been away from each
other since we've been married.
It'll be good for us to circulate
the air in here a little. It's only
a week - okay?

Barney nods but he's not happy about this. Actually, he's
scared to death. She gives him a kiss and exits.

CUT TO:
INT/EXT. TAXI CAB - MORNING - PRESENT DAY
BACK TO PRESENT DAY. Spring has arrived.

Barney rides in a taxi. Coffee in hand. The cab stops at a
red light in front of the MONTREAL MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS.

Barney looks out the window to see workers unraveling a
DRAPERY announcing the next exposition:

"LEO FASOLI - IN MEMORIAM. A RETROSPECTIVE."
WHITE 10-23-09 107.
ON THE DRAPERY is a PHOTO OF LEO from back in his Rome days.

The thought of his departed friend hits him hard. The taxi
pulls away.

INT. OFFICE - TOTALLY UNNECESSARY PRODUCTIONS - MORNING

Barney enters the office in a foul mood. The RECEPTIONIST
greets him with a smile.

RECEPTIONIST
Good morning, Barney.

BARNEY
My car was stolen. Find out what I
have to do to report it.

RECEPTIONIST
It's parked in the lot. I have the
keys right here.

Barney grabs the keys, walks away.
INT. TV SOUNDSTAGE - MORNING

Barney slips into the soundstage just as they start rolling.
He's fidgety. Anxious.

ON THE SET

A scene is playing out between O'Malley and the new, young,
ditzy, SEXPOT (21), cast as the new Nurse.

O'MALLEY
I have a feeling you're going to
work out just fine around here.

SEXPOT
Oh, I won't work out here. I go to
the gym for that.

SOLANGE (0.S.)
And CUT! Check the gate!

Solange gets up from the DIRECTOR'S CHAIR. She's now
directing the show, yet still dressed in the same type of
revealing, tight outfit her character would have worn.

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
And that everyone, completes the
first episode of our 30th season! !

The whole crew bursts into applause.
WHITE 10-23-09 108.

Even though it's Barney's show, the merriment around him
seems to only make him more lonely and bitter. He ducks out.

INT. BARNEY'S OFFICE - LATER

Barney's rifling through drawers and shelves looking for
something. He's frustrated, angry. SOLANGE enters.

SOLANGE
Why did you leave the set? I thought
you might want to give a speech.

BARNEY
Nope.

Solange stands there grinning from ear to ear, eager to tell
him something. Barney continues his searching.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
I'm not interested.

SOLANGE
You don't even know what I'm going
to say.

BARNEY

I'm not interested in what you're
going to say. That's the point.

SOLANGE
What if it were something really
interesting?

This is annoying the hell out of him.
BARNEY
Right now, I'm in a state of complete
disinterest to all things. Is that
clear or should I have someone
translate?
Solange drops an AIRPLANE TICKET in front of Barney.

SOLANGE
I'm going to Bulgaria. First Class.

Barney looks at the ticket.

BARNEY
You haven't flown in thirty years.

Barney hands her back the ticket and walks out of his office,
Solange follows...
WHITE 10-23-09 109.
INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Barney goes to the coffee machine. One of those automatic
ones where you press a button and it makes you a latte

He makes his choice. The machine REVS and GRINDS, forcing
them to raise their voices.

SOLANGE
I've been in systematic
desensitization therapy to get over
my fear of flying.

BARNEY
Are you out of your mind? Some idiots
keep printing thirty year old pictures
of you in bikinis so old Bolsheviks
can have something to jerk off to and
you're going to fly half way around
the world because of it? What do you
imagine it will be like - that you'll
step off the plane right onto the
tarmac, Chanel glasses, Hermes scarf
wrapped around your new 'do', a gaggle
of paparazzi awaiting your arrival?
You're a hundred and eighty years old
Solange, get over it.

The coffee machine stops. Dead silence. The entire office
watching them. Solange fights back tears.

MARK
What the hell is wrong with you?

BARNEY
With me? My friend Leo just died!

Silence.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Did you hear me?!

SOLANGE

DR. MANDEBAUM
Just answer it.

BARNEY
A... you know, goddamn it... it's
German... I can't even find the

fucking thing. Why should I care
what it's called?

(to Solange)
And why are you crying?

PRE-LAP: A phone dialing, then ringing.

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - DAY - PAST (2003)

Scotch in hand, Barney paces while on the phone. Desperate
and frantic without Miriam around.

MICHAEL (V.0.)
Hello?

BARNEY
Michael, hi, put your mother on the
phone, please.
INT. MICHAEL'S LOFT - BROOKLYN - DAY
Miriam is cleaning up clutter around Michael's apartment.
MICHAEL

Nice to talk to you too, dad.
(holding out phone)

Mom. .
MIRIAM
(into phone)
Hello.
INTERCUT
BARNEY

Miriam, please come home already. I
can't sleep without you beside me.

MIRIAM
I know. I keep reaching over for
you in bed and--

BARNEY
I bought our cemetery plots today.
MIRIAM
(beat)
What?
BARNEY

I can't handle being without you for
even a few days, and that got me
thinking and, well, I just needed
that settled. That we'll be together
forever.

MIRIAM
Barney...
WHITE 10-23-09 113.

BARNEY
I've learned my lesson. Come back
tonight. Please.

MIRIAM
I wasn't punishing you. And you
shouldn't have done that without talking
to me first. That's a big thing.

BARNEY
What does that mean? You're not sure?

MIRIAM
Why is everything all or nothing
with you? I say I need a little
space, and you go out and buy real
estate for our afterlife.

BARNEY
I'm sorry, I just--

MIRIAM

Overreacted? Yes, you did.

(beat)
I'm sure what you bought is fine.
What am I saying - if you bought it
it's certainly the best plot in the
whole city. But I'm still not coming
home today. I'm enjoying my week
with my son. Now I have to go, Blair
is waiting for us at the restaurant.
I love you--

BARNEY
Blair?!

MIRIAM
Don't even start. He actually took
YOUR advice and told them he had
another offer. So they called him
down for a final interview.

BARNEY
I can't believe you're there with
Blair.

MIRIAM

Barney, I'm not going to have this
discussion with you. I love you
but I really do have to go. Goodbye.

BARNEY
I love you.
WHITE 10-23-09 114.

She hangs up. Barney looks around the big, empty house,
going out of his mind, not knowing what to do with himself.

INT. GRUMPY'S BAR - NIGHT

Barney's sitting at the bar chatting it up with Jill anda
BLONDE (38) patron. He's already quite drunk.

JILL
--And so he leaves his OWN wedding
and chases after her onto the train.

BLONDE
No way! You're crazy!

Barney shrugs. Jill goes to serve another customer

BLONDE (CONT'D)
You don't remember me do you?

BARNEY
Should I?

BLONDE
I had a small part on your TV show a
few years ago.

BARNEY
Really? I'm sorry, I don't remember.
BLONDE
That's okay. I remembered you right
away.
(standing)

I'm going to freshen up a bit, would
you mind ordering me another?

The look in her eye tells us exactly where this is going.
Barney watches her walk away.

HARD CUT TO:
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - NIGHT
The blonde from the bar rolls off of Barney, naked, sweaty
and satisfied. Barney stares up at the ceiling. Too drunk
and too horrified to process what he's just done.
INT. DR. MANDEBAUM'S OFFICE - DAY

Barney, in a state of panic, bursts into Morty's office who
is eating lunch at his desk

BARNEY
I need a test. Now.
WHITE 10-23-09 115.

DR. MANDEBAUM
Test for what?

BARNEY
VD, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, AIDS--

DR. MANDEBAUM
Whoa, whoa, slow down. What the
hell happened?

BARNEY
Just give me the test, Morty. And I
need the results as soon as possible.

INT. BARNEY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

Driving home from the airport - a HUGE bouquet of roses with
a "Welcome Home" card sits in between Barney and Miriam.
Barney is conspicuously silent and nervous.

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

They walk in from the airport. Barney's acting strange.
Both anxious and nice. Too nice.

MIRIAM
It's good to be home.

BARNEY
Let me put these in water and I'll
unpack your bags. Go, relax.

MIRIAM
I have a better idea.

She wraps her arms around his waist and kisses him; she's in
the mood for love.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
I missed you.

BARNEY
I missed you too.

He squirms out of her arms and carries the roses to the
kitchen, talking from the other room.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
But you must be exhausted - I'll put
on some tea - and run you a bath
how does that sound?

She follows him into the kitchen.
WHITE 10-23-09 116.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Barney fills a GLASS VASE with water

MIRIAM
What's wrong?

BARNEY
Nothing. Why?

MIRIAM
Barney...

The phone RINGS. Barney LEAPS to answer it.
BARNEY
Hello? Hold on...
(to Miriam)
It's work. Problems on the set.
MIRIAM
When you're done hiding whatever it
is you screwed up while I was gone,
I'll be in the bedroom. Naked.
Miriam exits. Barney takes a deep breath.
BARNEY
Morty, so?... oh, thank God. Thank
you... okay, bye.

He hangs up. He closes his eyes and remains silent and still
for a long beat.

MIRIAM (0.S.)
Are you off the phone?

BARNEY
Yes, I am.

He takes another deep breath to compose himself and exits.
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ready for some good lovin', Barney walks into the bedroom,
but stops in his tracks when he sees--

Miriam crying. The phone in her hand.
MIRIAM
I don't know why, but I dialed star
69. You were acting so strange...

She has to sit down. She's trembling. Terrified.
WHITE 10-23-09 117.

MIRIAM (CONT'D)
Why did you lie about it being Morty
on the phone? Tell me the truth -
are you sick?

(beat)
TELL ME.

BARNEY
I'm not sick.

MIRIAM
The way you cough at night, all those
cigars--

BARNEY
Miriam, I'm not sick.

MIRIAM
Then what is it? What are you hiding
from me?
Beat.

BARNEY
It meant nothing to me.

Miriam is completely devastated.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Please, Miriam. We have a life.

MIRIAM
HAD a life.

She storms out. Off Barney, completely shell shocked we --

CUT TO:
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY
PRE-LAP - A KNOCKING at the door

The door opens revealing KATE, her eyes filled with tears
she throws her arms around Barney and won't let go.

BARNEY
Easy, kiddo.
(beat)
Let's not mourn just yet. Morty
says I've got at least a year before
I'm totally bonkers.

He has to gently pry her arms from around his neck.
WHITE 10-23-09 118.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Your mother's show is on. Why don't
you fix us a couple drinks. You
could use one.

She nods - that's for sure. She starts toward the kitchen --

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Have you talked to her yet?

KATE
No.

BARNEY
Don't worry her with anything. Okay?

Kate nods.
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - MOMENTS LATER
Barney's sitting at his desk. His eyes drifting over old
photographs and items of nostalgia. The final bars of Leonard
Cohen's "I'm Your Man" playing on Miriam's radio show.
MIRIAM (V.0.)

That was Leonard Cohen's "I'm Your

Man" - a request from our ever

faithful listener, Alphonse, all the

way from Montreal. And here's one

for you Alphonse - "I Don't Want To

Hear It Anymore" by Dusty Springfield.
Barney grins.

Kate is standing in the door watching him. She steps in and
hands him his drink.

KATE
Here you go, Alphonse.

Barney looks at her with surprise. Kate exits.

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BARNEY'S APARTMENT - DAY - PAST (2003)
Movers carry boxes down the hallway to the elevator. Barney
steps aside to let Michael past with a box in hand. Michael
won't even look at his father. We follow Barney back inside --

INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Through the apartment and into the kitchen where Kate is
helping to pack. Her eyes puffy from crying.
WHITE 10-23-09 119.
Barney paces back and forth. Back and forth.

Michael walks in to grab another box. He won't even look at
his father.

BARNEY
Michael, wait.
(beat)
I know how difficult this is for
both of you, but your mother and I
will work through this.

MICHAEL
Do you even understand what you did
here?

BARNEY
Of course.

MICHAEL

Then how could you have fucked this
up? How? She deserved so much better
but she still loved you, you
miserable, ungrateful prick

BARNEY
Watch your mouth. I'm still your
father.

MICHAEL

There's nothing I can do about that.
Barney SLAPS Michael.

It's so utterly shocking to both of them, that no one can
move or say a word. Michael then storms out of the house.

BACK TO:
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - DEN - PRESENT DAY
CRASH -- Barney shatters a framed photo, tearing the room
apart. Kate runs in and tries to stop him, but it's hard to
get past his flailing arms.

KATE
DADDY, STOP, PLEASE, STOP!!

He finally stops. Kate is unsure what to do.
He just stares at the TELEPHONE RECEIVER in his hand.

He looks up her. His eyes filled with tears.
WHITE 10-23-09 120.

BARNEY
I can't remember your mother's number.

FADE OUT:
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BARNEY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
TITLE: 6 MONTHS LATER
DING. The elevator doors open revealing Solange, carrying
two cups of coffee. She walks down the hallway to Barney's
apartment and lets herself in with a key.
INT. BARNEY AND MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
She enters and sets the coffees down.
SOLANGE
(calling out)
Allo? You better be decent.

INT. WALK-IN CLOSET - BEDROOM - BARNEY'S APARTMENT - SAME
TIME

Barney's side of the closet is filled with his clothes, while
the other that once held Miriam's wardrobe is completely bare.

Barney, in his best suit, is trying but unable to do his
tie. His frustration finally boils over.

BARNEY
Goddamn it!

He sees Solange in the doorway watching him.

SOLANGE
Here, let me do it.

She steps to him and does his tie. They say nothing. He
won't make eye contact.

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
There. As handsome as you've ever
been.
Barney double checks the knot in the mirror.

SOLANGE (CONT'D)
It's time to go.

She walks out first. He takes one last look in the mirror.
WHITE 10-23-09 121.
EXT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - GARDEN - DAY

Barney sitting at his table in the Ritz Garden, drinking a
glass of sparkling water

His breath is taken away when he sees --
BARNEY POV

Miriam entering the garden. Every bit as gorgeous, elegant
and graceful as she ever was.

Barney sits tight, taking advantage of every second he has
to simply watch her.

She sees him and smiles as she approaches the table.

MIRIAM
You look great.

BARNEY
You look fantastic.

They play through an awkward exchange of leaning in for a
kiss, and shaking hands before Barney just takes her into
his arms and hugs her. They sit.

MIRIAM
You're not going to get sick on me
again, are you?

BARNEY
Only coffee for me now. But I do
have crib notes...

(pulls out a paper)

My address and number, Kate's numbers,
Solange -- all the important stuff
in case I get lost. I was actually
thinking a dog collar might be easier

She tries to laugh, but has to fight off tears instead.

MIRIAM
I've been doing some research.
They're always coming out with new
treatments and trials--

BARNEY
Let's not do that whole thing. We
all know where this is going.
She nods.

MIRIAM
We can be friends now, can't we?
WHITE 10-23-09 122.

BARNEY
No. We can't.

MIRIAM
I'm here for you if you'll let me.
We had a beautiful marriage, but
it's over. I want you to be at peace

with that.
BARNEY
Have I ever given up when it comes
to you?
MIRIAM
Never.
BARNEY
So what makes you think I would start
now?
Beat.
JEAN

Bonjour, are you ready to hear the
specials of the day?

BARNEY
Sure.

EXT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - GARDEN - DAY

LATER

CU - A PIECE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE.

Barney and Miriam each have one. They grin with anticipation.

Miriam slices through the moist, warm chocolate sponge.
Carries it past her lips and savors... Mmmm. Heaven.

She opens her eyes to see--

BARNEY'S HAND hovering above his cutlery. He can't remember
which one he is supposed to use.

Miriam hands him his fork.

BARNEY
Thank you.

And they eat cake.
MIRIAM

Would you excuse me? I have to use
the ladies room?
WHITE 10-23-09 123.
INT. LADIES BATHROOM - RITZ CARLTON - MOMENTS LATER

Miriam crying in a stall.

INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

Miriam returns from the washroom and is panicked when Barney
is missing from the table. She races over to Jean.

MIRIAM
Jean, did you see Barney?

JEAN
No, Madame, he paid the bill, but
forgot his wallet on the table.

Jean hands her Barney's old, beat up WALLET.

A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER is sticking out of the wallet. Without
thinking why - she pulls it out. The paper old and cracked.
She carefully unfolds it--

INSERT - THE PAPER

"CANADIENS 2 BRUINS 1 IN OVERTIME. CONGRATULATIONS. MIRIAM"
It's the note she passed to him the night they first met.

He's carried this on him all these years. Seeing it literally
takes her breath away.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

She enters the same hall where she and Barney first met.
Barney is standing there, grinning from ear to ear as if
nothing is wrong.

BARNEY
What's wrong?

MIRIAM
I couldn't find you, I got so scared.

BARNEY
It's beautiful in here isn't it?

MIRIAM
You forgot your wallet at the table.

BARNEY
Look at you, you're practically
shaking.

MIRIAM
I thought I lost you.
WHITE 10-23-09 124.

BARNEY
Lost me? Hey, the kids are gone,
why don't we go home, curl up in
bed, watch a movie...

Miriam cocks her head, wondering why he said that.

MIRIAM
The kids...?

BARNEY
Yeah, the kids. You're the one who
dropped them off at school. Are you
okay?
(off her crying)
Oh my love, don't cry.

He pulls her close. She falls into his embrace, having
realized he's forgotten they ever split up.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
Have I not loved you enough today?

She buries her face in his neck to stop from completely
breaking down.

BARNEY (CONT'D)
So what do you say? Can we play hooky?

She can't bring herself to shatter his fragile reality.

MIRIAM
Let's get you home.

He takes her by the arm and walks her out of the lobby, as
happy as he's ever been.

It was in a ravine on Mount Orford
that Hydro workers stumbled upon the
remains of Bernard "Boogie"

REPORTER (CONT'D)
Moscovitch, who went missing over
thirty years ago. His friend, Barney
Panofsky, producer of the long running
soap "O'Malley Of The North", was
the only suspect in the case.

IDENTIFIED ON SCREEN, A PATHOLOGIST RESPONDS TO REPORTERS.

PATHOLOGIST
Our findings show that Mr. Moscovitch
died from either being severely beaten
with a blunt instrument or had fallen
from a considerable height. There
were NO gunshot wounds whatsoever.

O'HEARNE IS MOBBED BY A THRONG OF REPORTERS ON THE STREET.

O' HEARNE
Just because he didn't shoot him,
doesn't mean he didn't kill him.
This just brings us one step closer
to proving the truth.

A LONG SHOT OF THE HILLSIDE WHERE THE REMAINS WERE FOUND.

REPORTER
Police say the pathologist's findings
don't shed any new light onto who
may have been responsible for this
death --

As the report continues we PULL OUT from the TV into--
INT. KITCHEN - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

REPORTER
(on TV)
But at least one part of a thirty
year mystery has finally been solved.

Where Kate is pouring them each a tea. Michael has a thick
DOCUMENT in his hands that he's looking over

MICHAEL
Okay, what is this regular payment
out of the company?

Kate takes the document.

KATE
(laughs)
Oh, that. For years now, Daddy has
been paying some guy to make up those
fake tabloid items about Solange.
WHITE 10-23-09 126.

MICHAEL
Why?

KATE
I don't know. To make her feel good.
He even had them faxed from Bulgaria,
just in case she checked the number.
Daddy asked me to keep it going.

Kate drips honey into her tea. Hands it to Michael.
MICHAEL

(smelling honey)
Is this honey still good?

KATE
Honey doesn't go bad.

MICHAEL
Ever?

KATE
Ever.

MICHAEL

Where did you hear that?

KATE
I don't remember, but it's true.

Michael uses the honey and follows Kate out to the --
INT. DEN - COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Where they pass the well known sketch by Clara.

MICHAEL
I can't believe he's leaving that to
her.

KATE

As if running out on their wedding
to chase mom wasn't enough of a rub.
You know she hated that thing?

MICHAEL
She's not gonna hate it when she
finds out how much it's worth.
They continue out to the --
INT. SUNROOM - CONTINUOUS

MOUNDS OF PAPERWORK everywhere. Michael and Kate sit. He
passes her a flagged contract from one of the paper piles.
WHITE 10-23-09 127.

While she signs the pages, Michael looks out onto the lake.
It's a picture perfect day.

MICHAEL
What do you want to do about the
cottage?

KATE

We're never selling this cottage.

MICHAEL
Yeah. I agree.

She finishes signing the agreement. Hands it back.

Beat.

KATE
Okay, done. What's next?
MICHAEL

"To my wife, Miriam Grant Panofsky,
I leave our city condo, the original
painting by my late friend, Leo
Fasoli, and the adjoining plot to my
own in Mount Royal cemetery where my
wish is for her to buried along side
me"

(beat)
He shouldn't have included that.
It's not fair to her. She's married
to Blair.

KATE
Only until death do them part.

MICHAEL
There's one last thing, but it's not
relevant anymore. He left Boogie
money to publish any original writings
of his choosing when he should return.

KATE
See? He always hoped Boogie would
come back.

MICHAEL

That doesn't mean anything.

KATE
Of course it does. Why would he
leave Boogie money if he killed him?
WHITE 10-23-09 128.

MICHAEL
So no one would think he did.

KATE
Stop it. He didn't do it. Why can't
you let go of this already?

MICHAEL
You brought it up. I'm just saying
that we'll never really know what
happened.

KATE
He's our father. What else do you
need to know?

It's a touchy subject he'd rather not get into. Michael
stares out at the lake --

MICHAEL POV
BARNEY sitting on a lawn chair by the lake.

MICHAEL
I'm going to go down to the lake.

Michael exits.
EXT. COTTAGE - DAY
Michael walks to the lake and sits beside BARNEY.

Barney's mind is now almost completely gone. He doesn't
even react to Michael's presence.

Barney is slowly trying to peel a BANANA from the WRONG END.

MICHAEL
Try it this way.

Michael turns the Banana over for him. Barney looks at it
oddly. Turns it back over again.

Michael and Barney look out ACROSS THE LAKE where a young
family with two children play with a BEACH BALL in the water
From here they look much like Barney's family did years ago.

Michael takes out a cigar from his breast pocket. Clips and
lights it.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Here, just don't tell Kate.

He exchanges the banana for the cigar. Barney is able to
smoke it just fine.
WHITE 10-23-09 129.

Michael hears a RUMBLING in the distance. He spots a WATER
PLANE approaching. His eyes light up with excitement.

The plane descends toward the lake. Floating in the middle
of the lake is the BEACH BALL, having gotten away from the
young family previously.

The plane's HULL opens and SWALLOWS up water, ALONG WITH THE
BEACH BALL. It pulls back up into the sky, the hull closes.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Do you remember how much we loved
that when we were kids?

The WATER PLANE is still in the air and has begun to swing
back around.

It opens its hull and drops its water load - along with the
BEACH BALL onto the side of a MOUNTAIN which we can easily
identify as the spot where they found Boogie's remains.

Watching this, it suddenly comes together for Michael.
MICHAEL (CONT'D)
Boogie... Oh my God... dad, did you
see that?

He turns to Barney who, much to his surprise, is watching
the plane too.

Barney continues to puff on his cigar, but his thoughts, if
any, are a mystery to all.

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, dad... I'm so sorry...

Michael takes his father's hand, holding it, then pressing
it to his forehead just as Barney did with Izzy when he died.

KATE
Standing on the deck, watching them. Tears in her eyes.

FADE TO:
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Bright, green leaves on a tree moving with a gentle breeze.
A perfect blue sky behind them.

Blades of thick, green grass flutter.
The sounds of footsteps on a rocky path.

fresh flowers.
WHITE 10-23-09 130.
EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY

She reaches the highest peak on the only hillside in the
cemetery. A view of the entire city. Maybe the most
picturesque spot ever.

She mutters a silent prayer before laying the flowers down.
Her eyes moist with tears, she grazes the tombstone with her
fingertips, then starts back down the hill.

We remain on the hillside and move toward the grave.... the
