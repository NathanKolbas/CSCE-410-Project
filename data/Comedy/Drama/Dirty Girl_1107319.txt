Norman, Oklahoma~ 1989
OVER BLACK:

CLARKE (V.0,
Every gixl is born ‘with a
reputation.

EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL-~ LUNCHTIME
A PRETTY BLONDE GIRL takes a seat with her friends.

CLARKE {V.0.)
Some girls are sweet, dream of
pageant glory arid republican meat.

A HOMELY GIRL makes her ‘way across the front lawn with a
stack of books.

CLARKE (V.0.)

Some girls are hunchbacks, believe
what they‘re told. Never knowing
that their poo-nannies are gold.

THREE AVERAGE~LOOKING GIRLS pile into a car giggling.

CLARKE (V.0.)
Some girls fall in between, live
their lives unremarkable and clean.

A CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG rocks to and fro, steam fills the
windows .

CLARKE (V.O.)
--.and some girls...

Clarke (15, a soft-natured, overweight nerd with a bruise on
his face) watches as the Mustang climaxes.

CLARKE (V.0.)
-..that is, the best girls...

The car door flies open. A STOCKY BOY emerges putting on his
letterman’s jacket. A curly-headed figure, DANIELLE, sits up
in the backseat. She’s pissed about something.

CLARKE (V.0.)
++. are born dirty.

DANIELLE
Fuck you, asshole!
_ dust then, THREE LARGE BOYS tackle Clarke and begin to beat
him.

Title : “DIRTY GIRL”

INT. LIFESTYLE CHOICES CLASS

MR. POTTER (35, a hip-but~not-really sort a fellow) stands
before a blackboard with the word, “Choices”, scrawled across
it.

MR. POTTER ‘
Who can give me an example of a
good choice?

A NICE GIRL raises her hand.

NICE GIRL
Waiting. I mean if a guy really
likes you, he'll wait. And if he
doesn't understand then, you know,
so what.

Stocky Boy passes a folded note labeled “Danielle”.

MR. POTTER
Most excellent. But I know how it
is. I was young too. Our hormones
will get the better of us. The only
safe sex is no sex. If you don’t
stay busy, and practice abstinence,
you could end up like this guy my
mom knows. §o tell me, what’s a
healthy alternative?

THE NOTE makes its way across the classroom, reaches its
destination.

A REDHEADED GIRL raises her hand. Mr. Potter points to her.

REDHEADED GIRL
You could have a pizza party.

THE NOTE is opened.
MR. POTTER
Right on! Who doesn’t love pizza?
Anyone else?

A CLAMMY BOY this time. Mister Potter points.
CLAMMY BOY
Bowling’s always fun.

THE NOTE reads, “Wanna Fuck? Same time.-Same Place.”
MR. POTTER
You said it, man. Although I have
to admit I myself am pretty rusty.

The CLASS laughs.

DANIELLE (16) raises her hand, her fingernail polish is

chipped. She’s that girl that every high school has. The one

who is more mature, more sexual, and somehow, just

inexplicably dirty. Her clothes are always too small, her

hair is teased. She’is a skinny girl with disproportionately

large breasts, which are her pride and joy.

Mr. Potter notices Danielle, but does not point. She speaks

without being called upon.

DANIELLE
What are your thoughts on the
pullout method?

MR. POTTER
Huh?

DANTELLE

I mean if he spills on your belly
you should be okay, right? of
course right after the moment of
enchantment it only takes like five
seconds for things to get all
drippy.

(Yelling at Stocky Boy)
AND PRACTICALLY RUIN YOUR
UPHOLSTERY! !}

{back to Mr. Potter)
It’s so hard to have nice things.

INT. PRINCIPAL MULRAY'S OFFICE

Danielle sits across from PRINCIPAL MULRAY (late 40‘s,

balding).

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
You must like the time we spend
together.

DANIELLE
It's a real hoot.
Ne

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
Your classmates. are impressionable,
Miss Edmonston. Your ears might be
used to that kind of talk, but most
of these kids come from good
families.

Danielle, ignoring Principal Mulray, adjusts her bra,
checking to make sure “the girls” look good.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY (CONT’D)
Do you have any positive males in
your life?

Danielle, pulis out her compact, fixes her lipstick.

DANIELLE
No, I'm pretty sure everybody’s
negative, but you can never be too
careful.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
I mean...

DANIELLE
It's none of your business.

She begins poofing her hair.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
You are an exasperating girl, Ms,
Edmonston. According to Mr. Potter,
you spoke quite explicitly about
male projectile.

_ DANIELLE
Its a sex education class.

_ PRINCIPAL MULRAY
(correcting)
Lifestyle choices.

DANIELLE
Whatever .

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
I’m putting you in challengers.

With this news Danielle stops fidgeting.

DANIELLE
Special ed? That’s for retards.
 

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
(correcting)
Challengers. It’s either that or
expulsion. Mrs. Pierce will give
you your schedule.

DANIELLE
What's to know? It’s like that one
room in the basement all the time.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
You're a smart girl, you just make
poor choices. If you do your
homework and stop being a
distraction to others, you’li be
back with the normal kids in no
time.

Danielle starts to leave.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY (CONT’D)
Danielle, nobody likes a dirty
girl.

DANIELLE
Gosh, thanks for that really
awesome advice.

Principal Mulray busies himself with some paperwork.

DANIELLE (CONT‘D)
By the way, the challenger blew up.

Danielle exits.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
(into speaker phone)
Mrs. Plerce, hold my calls.

Principal Mulray closes his mini blinds, sits across from

Danielle’s empty chair, stares at it intently. We hear him
unzip his fly.

INT. CHALLENGERS CLASS ROOM

MRS. HATCHER (50's, a hand-dyed-linen-pantsuit kind of gal)
stands before the CHALLENGERS (mostly ethnic kids, with one
notable exception, CLARKE, who sits not at a desk, but at a
table apart, chewing his nails)
6.

MRS. HATCHER
Okay. Today we are going to start a
project that will hopefully teach
us that parenthood is no joke,
right Sabrina?

SABRINA, a very pregnant teen, shakes her head, “no”.

MRS. HATCHER
Okay, everybody partner up with
someone of the opposite sex.

Clarke watches as the other students partner up. His face is
bruised from the morning beating. His lip is cut.

MRS. HATCHER
Who doesn't have a partner?

THREE STUDENTS, Clarke included, raise their hands.

MRS. HATCHER
Okay, Benita, why don’t you move
over next to Juan. And Clarke...

Clarke seems resigned to the humiiiation of people not
knowing what to do with him.

MRS. HATCHER
»-we‘ll think of something.

Clarke puts a set of headphones on his head, presses play on
a walkman. Melissa Manchester's ‘You Should Hear How They
Talk About You’ is faintly heard.

The classroom door swings open, Danielle enters, hands a pink
slip to Mrs. Hatcher. ,

MRS. HATCHER
Class, this is Danielle Edmonston,
she’s joining us today, say
hello...

The class is completely uninterested.
DANIELLE
{vaising a black power
fist)
Agsalaam Alaikum.

This gets a stunned, silent response.
MRS. HATCHER
Danielle, we were just partnering
up. Why don’t you have a seat with
Clarke back there.

Danielle plops herself across from Clarke at his private
table, he removes his headphones.

DANIELLE
You're that fag, right?

Clarke bites his thumbnail.

Mrs. Hatcher pushes a cart between the desks, handing out
sacks of flour. During the following speech, Clarke and
Danielle stare at one another in silence.

MRS. HATCHER
For the next six weeks you are
married to your partner, and these
precious sacks of flour are your
bundles of joy. You will have to
name your baby, change your baby,
and most importantly, make sure no
harm comes to him-slash-her. You
will make daily entry journals of
your experiences.

Mrs. Hatcher sets a sack of flour between Clarke and
Danielle. Danielle looks from the dumpy sack of white flour
to Clarke.

DANIELLE
It takes after you.
EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL LOCKERS-— LATER

Danielle puts her books into her locker and slams the door,
revealing Clarke behind it holding the sack of flour.

DANIELLE
What do you want?

CLARKE
We're partners.

Danielle prowls down the hallway, Clarke right on her tail.

DANIELLE
No offense bud, but my designated
is, as of this morning, no longer
designated.
CLARKE
I don‘t know what that means.

DANIELLE
Danielle's three D’s of dating.
Discriminate, designate, dump. And
since the unfortunate dumping of
Greg, due to his lack of sanitary
respect, I am onto the next, and
quite frankly as a dick smoker you
don’t qualify.

CLARKE

But we’re supposed to be married.
DANIELLE

We're not on the samé level.
CLARKE

Ms. Hatcher said we need to be good

parents.

Danielle sees what she’s looking for, a hot prospect named
BOBBY(i6, thin, but cute), smoking in his car with friends.

DANIELLE
(pointing at Bobby)
Discriminate.
She pulls a mirror out of her bag and hands it to Clarke.

DANIELLE
Hold this.

Clarke holds the mirror up as Danielle fixes herself.
- DANIELLE
Ms Hatcher is a hippie twat, and
you are currently lowering my
market value.

Danielle freshens her lipstick.

DANIELLE
How do I look?

CLARKE
Great,

DANIELLE
Designate.

Danielle struts over to Bobby’s car and knocks on the window.
DANIELLE
Hey, you got a light?
(to the other guys)
Hey fellas.

Bobby lights Danielle's cigarette.

BOBBY
(knowing)
You're that girl, aren’t ya?

DANIELLE
(flirting back)
Yep I'm that girl.

BOBBY
You know what I heard about you?

DANIELLE .
Don't believe everything you hear.
Unless it’s really good. Then it’s
true.

BOBBY
i hear you're with the retards now.

The boys start to laugh, peel out, leaving Danielle in a
cloud of exhaust. :

Clarke watches as Danielle is humiliated. The Three guys who
clobbered him before, come seemingly out of nowhere and
tackle him again.

INT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER- AFTER SCHOOL

Danielle’s mom, SUE-ANN (mid-30's, but looks younger,
certainly not old enough to have a 16-year-old daughter.
Formerly trashy, she has cleaned up her act, but the
transformation isn’t entirely convincing). She is studying
the book of Mormon. She calls to Danielle as she heads to her
bedroom.

SUE-ANN
Your principal called me today. I
am very disappointed in you.

Danielle slams her bedroom door.
10.

INT. DANIELLE'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS
The walls of Danielle's bedroom are covered with photos of

men ripped from magazines— a mad collage of dashing,
idealized male images.

Danielle retrieves a spiral notebook from her closet. Inside
there are names and phone numbers- a scrapbook of conquests,
ink drawings and snapshots fill its lined pages. Danielle
picke up the phone and dials one of the numbers.

DANIELLE
Hey, is this Patrick?

On the other end we hear garbled Spanish.

DANIELLE
Sorry, wrong number.

Undaunted, she dials another...

DANTELLE
I’m looking for Wes.

WOMAN'S VOICE
Who’s this?

DANIELLE
My names Danielle, I’m a friend...

WOMAN'S VOICE
Listen bitch...

Danielle hangs up, dials another.

MAN'S VOICE (MIKE)
Hello?

DANIELLE
Mike? It's Danielle.

MIKE
Hey chicken, how you doin’?

DANIELLE
I could be doin’ better.

INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE- LATER

Darkness.
il.

THERAPIST
Just say whatever comes to mind.

An explicit slide of a naked woman circa 1978 flashes on the
wall.

CLARKE
Popcicles.

Another slide, the same woman, this time with a well hung man
with a beard,

CLARKE
Orange popcicles.

THERAPIST
And this one?

Another slide, this one of Jesus Christ, acting like Jesus.

CLARKE
Christian popcicles.

The florescent lights come on. Clarke is temporarily blinded.

THERAPIST
Pretty racy stuff, huh?
CLARKE
I quess.
THERAPIST

You know Clarke, sexual feelings
aren't something to be afraid of.
You wanna know what I think?

CLARKE
Okay-

THERAPIST
I think those pictures scared you.
That's why your responses were so
random. Do you follow?

CLARKE

You said to say what's in my head.
THERAPIST

Right.
CLARKE

i'm hungry.
iz.

THERAPIST
Tell me Clarke, now talking man to
man, here. Just us guys. What’s
your favorite kind of breast?

CLARKE
Huh?

THERAPIST
Long ones? Pointy ones? If ya had
to pick your favorite kind of
booby, what kind of booby would you
pick?

CLARKE
Boobies?

THERAPIST
Sure! Knockers, cha-cha’s, hoo-
ha’s! How do you Like ‘em?

“CLARKE
Hairy.
INT. DANIELLE’S BACKSEAT-NIGHT

Danielle rips open MIKE’s shirt revealing a very appealing
hairy chest. Mike is in his early thirties.

MIKE
Did you miss big Mike?
DANIELLE
Uh-huh.
MIKE
Tell him how much.
DANIELLE
A lot.
MIKE

A whole lot?

DANIELLE
A whole whole lot. A whole, whole,
whole, whole, whole...

A flashlight in Mike’s face stops his rather athletic
petting. A COP knocks on the window.
13.

INT. THERAPISTS LOBBY- LATER

Clarke waits on a leather bench. Muzak plays. He puts on his
headphones. Laura Branigan‘s “Gloria” is faintly heard.

Clarke's Dad, JOSEPH (40’s vaguely militant) leaves the
doctor's office followed by his mother, PEGGY (40's- vaguely
vague). Joseph is clearly pissed.

JOSEPH
Let's go.

INT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE-NIGHT

Sue-Ann is making out with her Boyfriend, RAY (40's, a
pallid, milk-toasty king of fellow).

RAY
Waiting brings its own rewards, but
you sure do look sweet tonight.

SUE-ANN
Stop.

RAY
I might be tempted to break a few
rules, if you'd let me.

SUE~ANN
Far as I know, the lord didn’t say
nothin’ ‘bout second base.

Sue-Ann unbuttons her shirt. Things get hot and heavy.

RAY
(whispering)

There’s a way that don’t count.
SUE~ANN

You know that upsets my tummy.
RAY

I'll be gentle.
SUE-ANN

You marry me, you can have the

front door.
Ray buries his head in Sue-Ann’s neck.

The DOORBELL interrupts them.
14.

INT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE- MOMENTS LATER

An OVERWEIGHT COP and his VERY THIN PARTNER stand over
Danielle with Sue-Ann.

OVERWEIGHT COP
Near as we could tell they were in
the early stages of groping.

SUE-~ANN
So she wasn’t hurt? You weren‘’t
hurt, were you baby?

VERY THIN PARTNER
If you pull her hair back, you'll
see he left a mark.

Sue-Ann brushes Danielle's hair to the side revealing a
monstrous hickey. She flashes Danielle a look of disapproval.

OVERWEIGHT COP
He says your daughter initiated
contact, but that doesn’t mean you
can't press charges, since she’s a
minor and he’s what?

Very thin partner checks his note pad.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Thirty-four.

Sue-Ann swallows hard.

OVERWEIGHT COP
But we suggest you leave the
punishing to his wife. She seemed
pretty P.o.’d.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Whew!

RAY
Well, we’ll be sure to straighten
things ont on our end.
Danielle looks at Ray, rolls her eyes and heads to her room.
CVERWEIGHT COP
{calling to Danielle)
You be a good girl now.

Danielle slams her door.
is.

SUE-ANN
Don’t you worry, officer.
{taking Ray's hand)
She just needs a good man in her
life.

INT. CLARKE‘S DAD'S CAR- THE RIDE HOME

Clarke's dad, Joseph, drives. Mom, Peggy, sits comatose on
the passenger side. Clarke sits in the middle of the back
seat.

JOSEPH
We had a deal son, and it seems to
me you're not holding up your end.
You know what that makes you? That
makes you a welcher. Only thing
worse then being a gay is being a
welcher.

CLARKE
I'm trying.

JOSEPH
Who am I supposed to believe- a
fifteen-year-old welcher or a
qualified medical physician?

CLARKE
He‘s a chiropractor.

JOSEPH
He‘s got experience! And he says
you are downright belligerent.
{then} *
Never met a harder nut to crack.

This last bit makes Clarke giggle.

Joseph pulls over to the side of the road and smacks Clarke's
face, grabs him by the shirt, and pulls him into the front
seat. .

JOSEPH
You think this is funny you little
shit? You are a hair’s breath from
getting that fat faggot ass of your
sent away for good, I still got the
we brochures, and right about now that
military academy is looking like a
pretty sweet option to me and your
mother.
16.

PEGGY
He's just scared of girls aren’t
you, honey?

A knowing look from his mother, tells Clarke that agreeing
with her will free him.

CLARKE
Yes.

Joseph lets go, resumes driving.

JOSEPH
Girls are the last thing in the
world you need to be scared of.
Some little piece peaks your
interest all you go to do is walk
right on up to her and say, “how's
about...

EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL- LUNCHTIME
Clarke trying out his father's advice on Danielle.
CLARKE

++» you and me catching a movie

sometime?” .
Danielle, hard at work on another boy, GREG (17, curly-
headed, good stock) laughs at Clarke. Greg blows a bubble
with his gum.

DANIELLE
T want a piece of that.

Danielle plants a kiss on Greg,

CLARKE
We got a presentation to do.

Greg goes along with the kiss, but is embarrassed in front of
Clarke.

GREG
(pushing off Danielle)
Not right now.

Danielle, having retrieved Greg's gum from his mouth, blows a
bubble.
17.

. CLARKE
(re: the sack of flour)
You're not being a very good

mother,
DANIELLE
Fuck off, fat boy.
(to Greg)

Am I gonna see ya later?
Clarke, slowly walks away, then turns back.

GREG
I gotta work.

DANIELLE
In life Greg, windows of
opportunity don’t stay open too
long. Right now, my window is, as
they say, open. Who knows if it’1l
stay that way. You are the chosen
one, meet me by my car after
school.

Greg notices SOME GUYS watching them.

GREG
I’1ll see what I can do,

Clarke holds their sack of flour, watching.

INT. CHALLENGERS CLASS ROOM- LATER

Benita and Juan are finishing up their flour baby
presentation. Their baby has a face and wears a diaper.

BENITA
«.-Maggie enjoys long walks by the
creek, stopping for sodas at Sonic,
and shopping.

MRS. HATCHER
Very good guys. Clarke, Danielle,
you're up.
The class turns to look at Clarke and Danielle sitting at
their table in the back with theix untouched sack of flour.
INT. CHALLENGERS CLASS ROOM- AFTER SCHOOL

Clarke and Danielle stand before Mrs. Hatcher's desk.
18.

MRS. HATCHER
Frankly, you both seem like smart
kids, you shouldn’t even be in this
class, but as long as you don‘t do
the work, this is where you're
gonna stay.

EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT~ AFTER SCHOOL
Danielle sits on the hood ef her Mustang waiting for Greg.
She spote him and gets excited, but he gets into a car with
his friends and takes off.
EXT. BUS STOP-AFTER SCHOOL
Clarke waits on the bench wearing his headphones.
Panielle’s ‘Mustang screeches to a halt.
DANTELLE
{calling to Clarke)
Get in, we got homework.
Clarke pulls off his headphones suspiciously.
DANTELLE
As long as I'ma retard, ain't
nobody gonna fuck me!
INT. DANIELLE’S LIVING ROOM~ LATER
Danielle enters, followed by Clarke.
DANIELLE (CONT'D)
Don't worry about being nice to my

mom. She’s a cunt.

Sue-Ann pops her head through the cubby that separates the
Living room from the kitchen.

SUE-ANN
Danielle, is that you?

DANIELLE
This is Clarke. He’s from school.

Sue-ann extends a hand through the cubby.
19.

SUE-ANN
Sue-Ann. I’m Danielle's mom, but
you wouldn't know it to look at me.

DANIELLE
That’s like a totally gross thing
to say.

SUE-ANN
(to Clarke)
People always think we’re sisters.
It's polite to clarify.

Sue-Ann extends a burnt cookie on a spatula.

SUE-ANN
Cookie?

DANIELLE
Nobody wants your sad instant
cookies, Sue~Ann.

SUE-ANN
You said you liked these.

DANIELLE
I said I liked the dough.

Danielle takes Clarke to her BEDROOM.

CLARKE
She seemed nice.

DANIELLE
If you need to use the bathroom,
avoid the mohogrammed towels.
Mama's certifiably herpified.

CLARKE
Ew.

DANIELLE
She was a big slut when I was
little, but now she’s with this
Mormon guy so she thinks she’s Suzy
homemaker .

Sue-Ann opens Danielle's bedroom door.

SUE-ANN
‘We talked about this. You can have
boys over, but this door stays
open.
20.

. DANIELLE
We're just doing homework, besides,
Clarke’s a fag.

Clarke is shocked that he has been outed so casually. Sue-Ann
is a bit worried.

SUE-ANN
Ray's bringing the kids over for
dinner, you guys think you'll be
finished by then?

DANIELLE
Maybe if you shut the God damn door
and leave us alone, we could
concentrate.

Sue-Ann reluctantly closes the door.
CLARKE
If I talked to my mom that way, my
dad would kick the shit out of me.
DANIELLE
I don't have a dad, so I do what i
want.

INT. DANIELLE’S BEDROOM- LATER

Danielle and Clarke work on their project. Clarke draws a
face on the bag of flour. Danielle writes in a notebook.

DANIELLE
Boy or girl?
CLARKE
I think I’d ruin a boy.
DANIELLE
(writing)

Girl. Name?

CLARKE
I don‘t know. Something regal.

DANIELLE
What about Joan? Like Joan Jett.

CLARKE
Ox Crawford? Yeah that’s nice.
21.

DANIELLE
Is there some sort of special gene
that made you say Crawford, when I
said Joan?

CLARKE
Why? What?

DANIELLE
It's like the more times a person
gets poked in the butt, the more
likely they are to say stupid faggy
shit.

CLARKE
I'ma virgin.

Silence.

DANIELLE
It's not that big of a deal.

CLARKE
Tell that toe my dad. He‘d be
happier if I didn’t exist.

DANIELLE
That's not true. I’m sure my dad
loves me, and I don't even know
hin.

CLARKE
That don’t make any sense.

DANIELLE
You know if you’re not careful,
you're gonna turn into one of those
overweight homos with no one to
love you but a gerbil named Bruce.

EXT. CLARKE'S HOUSE- LATER

Joseph waters the lawn like he’s taking a big macho pee.

As the mustang comes to halt in front of the house,

Joseph leers at his son, who visibly recoils in the passenger

seat.

DANIELLE
Is that your dad?

Clarke nods.
22.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
What is he, some kind of marine?

CLARKE
He likes people to think that.

JOSEPH
Where the hell have you been?

Clarke gets out of the cax sheepishly, forgetting his bag in
the back seat.

CLARKE
I had homework.

JOSEPH
You getting high? Answer me boy,
were you getting high? I will cart
you off so fast...

Danielle gets out of the car with Clarke’s bag.

DANIELLE
You forgot this.

Danielle hands Clarke his bag. She plants a big wet kiss on
him.

DANIELLE
(whispering) :
You ruined me for anyone else.
{to Joseph)
Hi.

Danielle gets back in the car, Joseph watches her ass as she
goes. He locks at his son, smiles.

JOSEPH
(proud)
Shit.

INT. CLARKE'S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS

Clarke's sanctuary is covered in posters of 1980’s female pop
stars, Pat Benatar, Laura Branigan, Melissa Manchester.

He turns on his stereo. Pat Benatar’s “Bit Me With Your Best
Shot" fills the air with defiant joy.

Clarke‘’s body puises. He is rather good dancer, given his ,
size.
23.

OUTSIDE HIS BEDROOM

His mother, Peggy, listens as her son sings along to the
music. She smiles.

INSIDE HIS BEDROOM

Clarke reaches under his mattress and removes a few gay porn
mags. As Pat warns us that she is about to, "put another
notch in her lipstick case,” Clarke opens a magazine to its
centerfold— a thin blonde male.

INT. DANIELLE’S LIVING ROOM- LATER

Sue-Ann sits at the table with Ray and his son, CHARLIE (16,
middle American cute). Danielle enters.

RAY
(announcing happily)
There she is!!

SUE-—ANN
Baby, we saved you some. It's on
the stove.

Charlie’s back is to Sue-Ann and Ray. He flicks his tongue
through his V‘d fingers.

DANTELLE
No offense, but I’m coming down
with something.

SUE-ANN
A cold?
DANIELLE
(to Charlie)
Bulimia.
RAY

Your mother and I have something we
want to discuss with you.

Danielle looks around the table. Something's wrong.
DANIELLE
Where’s Mindy?
INT. DANIELLE’S BEDROOM- CONTINUOUS

Danielle pushes her bedroom door open. ”
24.

out, Bitch}

Mindy (8, Blonde, perky) plays Barbie’s on the floor. She
holds up a doll.

MINDY
You can be Skipper!

: DANIELLE
Get out of my room.

MINDY
It's my room, toc.

Sue-ann appears behind Danielle in the doorway.

SUE-ANN
Why don’t you come have a talk with
us, honey.

INT. DANITELLE’S LIVING ROOM- LATER

Danielle sits on the couch between Mindy and Charlie. Ray and
Sue-Ann sit across from them in matching arm chairs holding
hands.

DANIELLE
This is bullshit. You can marry
this Mormon loser if you want to,
but there's no way I’m sharing my
room with that little twat.

RAY
Now that will be rule number one.
Anybody caught swearing under this
roof, gonna get their mouth washed
out with soap.

DANIELLE
Fuck you.

RAY
Don’t test me.

MINDY
What's a twat?

RAY
Now you see there. That's what I'm
talking about. Evil has a unique
way of spiraling.
25.

SUE-ANN . )
Very well put, honey.
DANIELLE
{to Mindy)
A twat is an ugly, flatulent,
hairless vagina.

RAY
Mindy, go to your room.

Mindy heads to Danielle’s room.

DANTELLE
Hey!

Danielle runs past Mindy and blocks her bedroom door. Mindy
kicks Danielle in the shin, and passes.

DANIELLE
Little bitch!

CHARLIE
Girl fight!

Sue-Ann tries to pull Danielle off of Mindy.

Danielle elbows her mother in the gut, Sue-Ann falls to the
side.

Ray steps in and easily hoists Danielle off of Mindy.

MINDY
My head hurts.

Danielle flails in Ray’s arms.
RAY
Calm down! I am stronger and I will
win.
Danielle gives Ray a backward kick to the groin.
Ray falls next to Sue-Ann. Danielle has defeated all.

DANIELLE
You're not my dad.

SUE-ANN
That’s something we'd like to talk
to you about.
26.

INT. DANIELLE’S LIVING ROOM- LATER

Danielle, Mindy, and Charlie are re-set on the couch, Sue-Ann
and Ray present a united, if wounded, front.

RAY
Let's pray.

All close their eyes, except Danielle.

RAY (CONT'D)

Dear lord, life.is a struggle, and
we are only as good as the
struggles you make us fight.

Charlie begins to play with the back of Danielle's neck.

RAY (CONT'D)
We pray to you, dear friend, to
make the struggle worthwhile...

Danielle elbows Charlie in the stomach.

RAY (CONT’D)
Amen.

ALL (EXCEPT DANIELLE)
Amen.

RAY
Have you heard of the Personal
Kingdom, Danielle?

MINDY
That's the magical place in the sky
where we'll live for all eternity!

RAY
Very good Mindy.
DANIELLE
So?
RAY

We need you there with us,
Danielle. If not, there‘ll be a
problem...

SUE-ANN
With getting in.
27.

DANIELLE
You're worried about being on the
list?

RAY

After your mother and I are
married. I'm gonna adopt you.

DANIELLE
The hell you are.

RAY
The hell I’m not.

MINDY
We're gonna wash your mouth out
with soap, daddy.

SUE-ANN
Danielle, you have a choice, being
sixteen and all. Law says you get
to decide.

DANTELLE
Then, no. That’s it. I'm not doing
it.

SUE-ANN

Think about it, Danielle. You
always wanted a dad.

DANIELLE
I have a dad.

RAY
I am taking this family on a
retreat this weekend. A little
fishing, a little hot cocoa, help
you get used to the idea.

DANIELLE
I'm not going anywhere. Clarke and
I have to work on our project.

SUE~ANN
I‘m sure he’ll understand.

DANIELLE
You told me I was a disappointment
to you, now you're keeping me from
doing my homework. Nice.
28,

SUE-ANN
Danielle...

DANIELLE
Do you want me in special ed
forever? desus Christ!

SUE-ANN
You and I both know that I can’t
leave you alone.

MINDY
I have a baby sitter, and I'm
seven.

CHARLIE
E'll stay if you need someone to
watch her.

DANIELLE
Screw you,

RAY
It's tough love time Danielle. You
don’t want us. We don’t want you
either. You can stay.

DANIELLE
Thank you.

SUE-ANN
Ray?

RAY

But we're taking all the food out
ef the kitchen, the money out of
your pockets..

DANIELLE
Fine.
RAY
--. and the keys to your car.
DANTELLE
What?
RAY

Then you'll know what it's like to
be alone and stranded for all
eternity.
29.

_SUE-ANN
Ray, this is not a good idea.

RAY
Now heck Sue-Ann, you want me to be
the man of the house, you gotta let
me make the tough decisions, After
this weekend, Danielle will be
begging me to be her daddy.

DANIELLE
{referring to Charlie)
Yeah? That would mean this guy
would be my brother.

RAY
Is that a problem?

DANIELLE
Yeah, considering I fucked him.

INT. DANIELLE’S BEDROOM- LATER
Danielle lays in bed staring at the many men on her ceiling.
Sue-Ann pushes the door open.

SUE-ANN
You happy now? Wouldn’t surprise me
if he gave up on us.

DANIELLE
Fine by me.

SUE-~ANN
Ray’s a good man, he'll be a good
father.

DANIELLE
Could you close my door, please?

SUE-ANN
We got a man who’s willing to be
the man for us...

DANIELLE
You can try and make me be a
Mormon, but you’re still a shitty
mother.
30.

SUE-ANN
Good guys don’t come around that
often. I’d like to keep this one.

DANTELLE
He’s not even cute.

SUE-ANN
We got a nice little family goin’
here. Don’t screw it up.

DANIELLE
I don’t want your stupid fake
family.

SUE-ANN
Well, we'll see how you do on your
own.

Sue-Ann closes the door.

Danielle opens her spiral notebook, pulls out a strip of
photos taken in an amusement park booth. The pictures show
Sue-Ann at 16 with a very good-looking young man- silly
faces, rabbit ears, and finally, kissing. Danielle touches
the young man’s face.

INT. DANIELLE’S KITCHEN- THE NEXT MORNING

RAIN tinkles on the trailer’s aluminum roof.

Sue-Ann and Ray pull the last of the food from the cupboard
and pack it in Grocery bags.

A groggy Danielle emerjes from her room in time to see them
exit with it. She follows them to the FRONT DOOR

Sue-Ann puts the food in the trunk of Ray's car. Mindy and
Charlie sit in the backseat, road trip ready. Ray heads to
Danielle's Mustang.

RAY
(to Danielle)
You sure you don‘t wanna to come?

_ Danielle gives him the finger.

Sue-Ann begrudgingly nods to Ray, “it’s okay”, he, in turn,
locks up Danielle's Mustang, and puts the keys in his pocket.

DANIELLE
How am I supposed to get to school?
31.

EXT. RAINY STREET

Danielle makes her way to school, She‘s dry enough under her
umbrella.

A CAR speeds past, dousing her in a wave of gutter-water.

INT. CHALLENGERS CLASS ROOM

Clarke, Danielle and Joan the flour baby stand before the

class. Danielle is very soggy, her curly hair matted, make-up
smeared.

DANIELLE
Meet Joan.

CLARKE
..» so named for the irrepressible
lead singer of the Blackhearts...

DANIELLE
+++ and a notoriously alcoholic,
child abusing movie star.

EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY- LATER

CLARKE
You look like shit.

DANIELLE
Don't fuck with me. I haven't eaten
in like 13 hours.

CLARKE
Why not?

DANIELLE
Because my mother thinks she can
starve me into being a Mormon.

CLARKE
That sucks.

DANIELLE
I’m having a really shitty day. If
you don't mind, I just want to be
alone.
32.

CLARKE
My dad said I could take you out
tonight, his treat. I have
discriminated and designated, and I
pick you. -

DANIELLE
Really Clarke, just go away.

CLARKE
He’d give me his credit card, if
you wanted to go to dinner or
something.
Some CUTE GIRLS pass, giggling.

CLARKE (CONT‘’D)
You gotta eat.

DANIELLE
We're ordering in.
EXT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE-NIGHT
Clarke parks his father’s Oldsmobile in the driveway.

Danielle opens the FRONT DOOR to find Clarke standing in a
shirt and tie holding a corsage.

DANIELLE
Nice flower.

CLARKE
It was my mother’s idea.
INT. DANIELLE’S LIVING ROOM- LATER

Chinese take-out ie spread all over the coffee table.
Danielie sits on the couch, Clarke is on the floor.

Danielle struggles with her chopsticks.
DANIELLE
Screw this, I need a fork. You want
cne?

Clarke nods. Danielle goss to the kitchen. Clarke turns down
the lights and moves over to the couch.
33.

DANIELLE

(from kitchen)
Chinese men, must be good with
their fingers, I swear. I hear they
have straight pubic hair. I tried
to get a look at Shani Suzuki’s in
the locker room once, but she’s
really careful with her towel so I
never saw shit.

(back in living room)
Why are the lights off?

CLARKE
Plorescent bulbs hurt my eyes.

DANIELLE
Sue-Ann’s so cheap.
(taking a seat next to
Clarke)
You'd figure at her age she’d wanna
give her face the benefit of the
doubt, but it saves money, so I
guess she don’t mind being green.
{Clarke puts his arm
around Danielle)
What are you doing?

CLARKE
Nothing.

DANIELLE
You're hitting on me and I don’t
appreciate it.

CLARKE
I have discriminated and
designated.

Clarke clumsily goes in for the kill, tries to kiss Danielle.
She stands up to get out of the way, and Clarke, unable to
control his large body slams his nose into the wood arm of

DANIELLE
What the fuck? I thought you were a
faggot.

CLARKE

Only 65 percent.

DANIELLE
What?
34.

CLARKE
My therapist showed me a chart, and
it says right now I am 35 percent
hetero. If I get it up to 50
percent, my parents won’t send me
to military school.

DANIELLE
You're bleeding.

Clarke touches the blood trickling from his nose.

DANIELLE

I‘1l get you a Kleenex.-~
CLARKE

Thanks.
DANTELLE

Well, I don’t want you getting your
AIDS all over my sofa, now do I?

Danielle hands Clarke a Kleenex. He lays his head back,
pinching the bridge of his nose with one hand, shoving the
Kleenex up his nostril with the other.

DANTELLE
Soon as that bleeding stops, you'd
best go. This is the part where you
get dumped.

CLARKE
You send me back now, they're gonna
know we didn’t do it.

DANIELLE
Contrary to popular belief, I am
not the world’s personal whore bag.

CLARKE
I’m sorry.

DANIELLE
Yeah, well, you should be.

CLARKE
I just figured after yesterday you
wouldn’t mind,

DANIELLE
Yesterday was a rare act of pity
bestowed upon the pitiful.
CLARKE
T suck.

DANIELLE
Yes you do.

CLARKE
Joan’s family tree is due tomorrow.
Shouldn‘t we work on it?

DANIELLE
You go on home now.

CLARKE
Sometimes he hurts me.

Long Pause.

DANIELLE
Well, they already think we're
doin’ it, what am I gonna save my
reputation now?
(then)
You owe me one.

DANIELLE’S DINING AREA-LATER

CLARKE
It's lopsided.

DANIELLE
Looks like we’re gonna be spending
the holidays with your side of the
family.

CLARKE
We should put something on your
side to balance it. Maybe draw some
birds or something to sit in’ the
branches.

CLARKE ‘
It just doesn't look very good.

Danielle leaves the room.

35.

Danielle and Clarke survey their work. On a piece of poster
board, they have sketched out Joan's family tree. Clarke's
side is heavy with names extending back a couple of
generations, Danielle’s side ends with Sue-Ann‘s parents.

Danielle quietly ponders her side of the tree, then Clarke’s.
36.

CLARKE
(calling after her)
Where you goin’?

Danielle returns with something behind her back.

DANIELLE
I'm gonna show you something, and
when I do you can't say it's stupid
or nothin’.

CLARKE
Okay.

Danielle hands him the photo strip of her parents.

CLARKE (CONT’D)
What'd you do to your hair?

DANIELLE
That’s my mom, idiot.

CLARKE
This your dad?

DANTELLE
I found it in my mom‘s jewelry box
when I was little and swiped it.

CLARKE
He‘s hot.

Danielle takes the photo back as if reclaiming her privacy.

DANIELLE
Thanks. .

CLARKE
Let’s put him in.

DANIELLE
Don’t know his name.

CLARKE
I'm a real good draw-er. Could
draw him in.

DANIELLE
dust do birds or something.
37.

CLARKE
Poor Joan. She only has one grandpa
and he's a total dick. What are we
gonna tell her?

DANIELLE:
That they were high school
sweethearts, and that he was
handsome and magical.

CLARKE
You know if they were high school
sweethearts, he’d be in her
yearbook. -

DANIELLE
I’ve been through those things like
a zillion times, he didn’t go to
her school.

CLARKE
Maybe he wasn’t a student.

It is clear that Danielle has never thought of the
possibility of her father having been a teacher.

She races to her MOTHER'S BEDROOM CLOSET
Pulls the yearbooks down from high, hands Clarke one.
DANIELLE
You take this one.
INT. SUE-ANN’S BEDROOM-LATER
Clarke and Danielle are on the floor flipping through the
pages of Sue-Ann‘’s yearbooks. Clearly, they have found
nothing.
DANIELLE
It's just as well, I wasn't
thrilled with the idea of my daddy
being a pedophile.
Clarke flips through Sue~Ann’s Senior book.
CLARKE

This one doesn’t have any
signatures.
38.

DANIELLE
That's the year she dropped out
‘cause of me.

Clarke casually flips the pages.

CLARKE
Football players, yummy.

DANIELLE
They‘re the worst. I mean the idea
and all is hot, but that cream they
use is so nasty.

CLARKE
I like the way they smell. It's
like Ben Gay and ferns.
DANIELLE
You have no self respect. I’m gonna
get some more food, you want some?
Clarke shakes his head no. Danielle leaves the room.

Clarke spots something in the yearbook.

INT. DANIELLE'S RITCHEN-—CONTINUOCUS
Danielle is fixing herself a plate.

CLARKE (0.8.)
Danielle?

DANIELLE
What? '

Clarke enters the kitchen holding the yearbook open to face
Danielle.

CLARKE
TI found him.

Danielle drops her plate. It shatters on the floor. She moves
slowly toward Clarke. She takes the book from him. She’s so
anxious, she doesn't know where to look.

Clarke points to the head of her father in a group photo of
the football team.
39.

DANIELLE
(reading)
Second assistant coach, Danny
Briggs.

CLARKE
Danny?

Danielle looks up at Clarke.

CLARKE (CONT‘D)
You're named after him.

The telephone rings. Danielle is stunned, cannot answer it.
After four rings, she finally picks up the receiver.

 

DANIELLE
Hello?

INT. CABIN-CONTINUOUS

Sue-Ann is on the phone, Ray is preparing a fishing rod next
to Mindy.

SUE-ANN
We made it in. Just checking on
you. Everything going okay?

DANIELLE
Fine.

RAY
Ask her if she's done any good
thinking?

SUE-ANN
Have you had time to think about
things?

In the KITCHEN Danielle picks up a magic marker.

DANIELLE
Yeah... You’re right. I do need a
man in my life.

At the CABIN, Sue-Ann covers the receiver.
SUE~ANN

(mouthing to Ray)
It worked.
40.

RAY
Told you so.

SUE-~ANN
Listen baby, under the lamp in my
bedroom I left you some cash. Go
ahead and order yourself a pizza.

DANIELLE
Okay-

In the KITCHEN, Danielle begins to write something down.

SUE-ANN
We'll be back on Monday.
DANIELLE
Okay.
SUE~ANN
Love you.
DANIELLE
Okay.

Danielle finishes her writing.

In the space left vacant on the familly tree, Danielle has
written the name, DANNY BRIGGS.

CLARKE
Now what?

Danielle gestures to the stack of phone books behind Clarke
DANIELLE
Hand me that phone book.

EXT. QUIET STREET- LATER

Danielle and Clarke stop the Oldsmobile in front of a small
but immaculate home. Joan is strapped into the back seat.

CLARKE
This it?

DANIELLE
{referring to the phone
book)

816 South Lahoma.
41.

CLARKE
Maybe there’s another Danny Briggs
in Norman.

DANIELLE
No this is it. I feel it. Somethin’
simple about it, makes it true.

CLARKE
Maybe you shoulda’ called first?

DANIELLE
And said what? Hi, I‘m your
illegitimate daughter come back to
haunt you.

Just then, a GOOD LOOKING MAN (late thirties, put together)
exits the house with a bag of garbage.

DANIELLE
Oh my god.
. CLARKE
Phat him?
DANIELLE

He's been nine blocks away for
sixteen years. And now he’s right
in front of me.

CLARKE
He’s gorgeous.

DANIELLE
Bet your sweet ass he is.

The Good Looking Man goes back into the house. Danielle, who
can't lose him again, impulsively gets out of the car, and
heads up the walk way. Clarke follows a few steps behind.

Nervously thrilled, Danielle takes a moment before ringing
the doorbell.

The Good Looking Man opens the door, but leaves the screen
shut.

GOOD LOOKING MAN
Yeah?

DANIELLE
Hil
Ne

42.

Good Looking Man spies Clarke hovering on the stairs behind
Danielle.

GOCD LOOKING MAN
(svapicious)
Hi.

DANIELLE
I'm sorry. I’m Danielle, that there
is Clarke.

GOOD LOOKING MAN
Uh-huh.

DANIELLE
I'm Sue-Ann’s little girl.

Danielle waits for his response, but Good Looking Man draws
only a blank.

GOOD LOOKING MAN
Good for you. Is there something I
can help you with?

Danielle doesn’t know what else to say. Clarke picks up the
slack.

CLARKE
We're looking for Danny Briggs. You
him?

A shot of recognition passes over the man’s face, he’s about
to speak when we hear...

MAN'S VOICE (0.8.)
Who is it, Billy?

Danielle gets excited all over again, her hope revived.

BILLY

Couple of kids.
MAN'S VOICE

Tell ‘em we don't want any.
BILLY

I don’t think they’re selling

anything.
A SECOND GOOD LOOKING MAN appears in the doorway as well.

DANIELLE
Daddy?
43,

SECOND GOOD LOOKING MAN
I should hope not. .

BILLY
They're looking for Danny. Are you
his kid or something?

Danielle nods yes.

SECOND GOOD LOOKING MAN
I knew something was up with those
people. :

INT, 816 SOUTH LAHOMA, LIVING ROOM-LATER

The decor is heavily mission, but clean and sparse, with well
chosen, well placed art on the walls.

Danielle and Clarke lock out of place on the fine leather
sofa.

Billy enters with a tray of tea for four. Then sits beside
the good looking man, PETER.

BILLY
Okay we have lemon ginger, cinnamon
yerba matte or classic chamomile.

DANIELLE
So my daddy lived here? When?

CLARKE
Is that how you say that? Kam-o-
mile? I've never known how to say
that. .

DANIELLE
Would ya shut the fuck up? We're
trying to have an adult
conversation here.

PETER .
Let’s see we moved in here what,
two years ago?

BILLY
Three. Remember? It was just after
my sister’s wedding which was a
week before the space shuttle blew
up.
44.

PETER
What a sad time for the country.

CLARKE
I’m still not over it.

DANIELLE
I don’t want to be rude or nothing,
but where the fuck is my dad?

BILLY

You're saucy, I like that!
CLARKE

Z like your house. It’s super

‘tasteful.
Danielle shoots Clarke a nasty look.

PETER
You should have seen it when we
moved in. That wife of his had it
all dene up in faux country.

CLARKE
I hate that. Like everything is an
antique, but when you get closer to
it, you realize that everything is
actually new and just made to look

old.

BILLY
Exactly.

CLARKE
So tacky. ‘

DANIELLE

He has a wife?

BILLY
dudy, I think her name was.

PETER
No, Janet, like the middle Brady.

BILLY
Well if you asked me I think she
Looked more like Sam the butcher.
We almost didn’t get the house
because of her.
45.

PETER
Once she found out that we were in
a long term committed life

partnership.
BILLY
Bitch.
DANIELLE
You got their address?
BILLY
Does she know about you? Danny’s
wife?
PETER

Wretched sack of shit that she is.

DANIELLE
I didn’t know about her.

Billy gets up and leaves the room.
CLARKE
(vethis tea)
This is delicious.

Billy returns with a shoebox full of mail and a note card.

BILLY
They wanted us to forward their
mail.

PETER

We never did.

BILLY
You wanna deliver it?

Danielle takes the shoebox and the note card.
PETER
She's gonna shit twice and die.
INT. CLARKE’S DAD’S BLUE OLDSMOBILE~ LATER
Clarke drives as Danielle ponders the box of mail in her lap.
CLARKE

I've never seen a real live
homosexual couple.
46.

DANIELLE
Get over it, you fuckers are
everywhere. :

INT. CLARKE’S BEDROOM- NIGHT

Peggy, makes her son’s bed. As she tucks in the sheets, her
hand finds something under the mattress. She pulls out
Clarke's cornucopia of gay porn. Joseph enters, sees what his
wife is holding.

INP. DANIELLE’S DINING AREA~LATE NIGHT

Clarke is asleep on the sofa. Danielle sits at the dining

room table, going through her father’s mail, mostly outdated
pills and junk mail, but she opens it nonetheless.

INT. DANIELLE’S LIVING ROOM-~ THE NEXT MORNING

Clarke snoozes. Danielle pokes him. She has a rather large
pack slung over her shoulders.

DANIELLE
Get up!

CLARKE
What?

DANIELLE

We got’s to go.

Clarke gets up and heads to the bathroom. We can hear him

‘yelieving himself on the other side of the door.

CLARKE
Where do you wanna eat breakfast? I
think Sambo’s takes credit cards.

DANIELLE
You're taking me to California.

The peeing sound stops suddenly. The bathroom door opens
slowly.

CLARKE
You’re a crazy person.

DANIELLE
I don't have a car, or I’d drive
myself.
al.

CLARKE
Danny you gotta be more sensible.
Talk to your mom when she gets
back,

DANIELLE
It's a three day trip if we haul
ass. By the time Sue~Ann notices
I’m gone, I’11 already be there.

CLARKE
My parents will kill me.

DANIELLE
Tell them you were manipulated by
my pussy.

CLARKE
I feel for you, I do, but I can’t
steal my dad’s car. I don’t know
what would happen , but somehow I
imagine it would hurt... a lot.

DANIELLE
I don’t want to be a Mormon,
Clarke, and I don’t want to share
my room with that pissy little cunt
bag. This is my chance. I’ve never
known my daddy, and now I got a
name and an address, and some hope.

CLARKE
To ocan’t.

DANIELLE
You disgust me.

CLARKE
I’m sor...

DANIELLE
Get Out!

INT, CLARKE’S HOUSE- A LITTLE LATER.
The house is quiet, somewhat empty. Clarke enters.

CLARKE
I’m home! Mom?

No answer.
48.

Clarke goes. to the KITCHEN, opens the refrigerator door,
drinks milk from the carton.

. Then, his father's voice from behind...

JOSEPH
You have a good time?

Clarke turns around to find his parents sitting at the
kitchen table, clearly in conference mode.

Clarke sees his PORN COLLECTION spread all over the table.
JOSEPH
Now what are we gonna do about you?
You know you’re not supposed to
drink from the carton.
Clarke's eyes meet his father’s, he knows that look.

Clarke makes a break for it, darts for the FRONT DOOR,
dropping the carton of milk.

Joseph tries to chase him but is hindered by the table,
giving Clarke enough of a head start, so that he makes it to

THE OLDSMOBILE
Clarke starts up the car and peels out.

Joseph flies from the house, trips over a SPRINKLER, hops
down the street after his son.

Clarke is too fast for hin.

INT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE

Danielle eats cold Chinese food in the kitchen. Somebody
outside lays on their CAR HORN.

Danielle opens the mini blinds in the LIVING ROOM window to
see what's up.

Clarke yells from THE OLDSMOBLIE.

CLARKE
Bring Joan!

Danielle grabs her bag, and Joan, then heads out the FRONT
DOOR.
49,

Clarke takes the tape out of his walkman and inserts it into
the car radio, sharing his music for the first time.

Melissa Manchester, full voiced, blasts out of the speakers,
“You should hear how they talk about you!” as.

INSIDE THE BLUE OLDSMOBILE ON THE OPEN ROAD
Clarke drives. Danielle has her feet up on the dash.
Slow push in on Joan strapped into the backseat.

CLARKE (V.O AS JOAN)
Dear diary, I’m super excited about
our family vacation. I'm only a
week old and already am seeing all
the great sites of this great
land...

Danielle rolls up the window as they speed past a cattle
ranch.

CLARKE (V.O. AS JOAN)
It is said that most American
families don’t spend enough quality
time together...

The Oldsmobile speeds past a sign that says, “Now leaving
Oklahoma. Ya'll come back now, ya hear?”

Danielle opens the smal] sun roof. She stands up raises her
arms and screams as the wind blows through her hair.

Clarke looks up at her, smiles, and presses his foot harder
on the gas .

CLARKE (V.O AS JOAN)

My parents are different. They’re
rebel outlaws, out to cause trouble
and have a good time.

DANIELLE
AHHHHHHEHHH t

Danielle plops back into her seat, a giggling mad woman.
DANIELLE

I’ve never been out of Oklahoma.
God Damn!
50.

CLARKE
My grandma lives in Dallas, so I'm
used to travelling.

DANIELLE
You ever see the ocean?

CLARKE
No.

DANIELLE
When we get to Fresno, we'll go to
the beach,

Melissa Manchester finishes her song and fades out.

CLARKE
Don’t you just love Melissa
Manchester?

DANIELLE
I'm more of a Whitesnake girl.

CLARKE
I was thinkin’ we could enter the
talent show when we get back. Do
one of ker songs together.

DANIELLE
I’m not gettin' on no stage,
especially with you.

Danielle notices that she has hurt Clarke’s feelings.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
You got to uhderstand Clarke, you
and I come from different worlds.
It just wouldn't be right in the
public eye to see the two of us
belting out the theme from Ice

Castles.

CLARKE
What if we did, “Don't Cry Out
Loud"?

DANIELLE

Clarke, I’m not going back.

CLARKE
Danny? He may not want you.
Sl.

DANIELLE
I'm a fucking babe.

CLARKE
What about his wife?

DANIELLE
I’m sure I can handle her, thank
you very much.

Danielle begins to paint her toenails on the dash.

CLARKE
If you spill that, my dad‘1] kill
me.

DANIELLE

Baby, you came out of the closet,
stole his car and took off with the
class whore. You are the definition
of dead.

Danielle turns up the radio. Pat Benatar screeches “Hell is
for Children”.

DANIELLE
(ret song)
Now this is me!

Danielle thrashes her head as she paints her nails.

INT. POLICE STATION- DAY

Joseph and Peggy stand before VERY THIN PARTNER (one of the
cops that brought Danielle home) who is behind a tall
counter.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Why don’t you go on home. I’m sure
your son is probably already there
waiting for you.

JOSEPH
My son is a problem child who has
gone off the deep end.

PEGGY
He’s special.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Oh, he’s a retard.
52.

JOSEPH
I wish he were.

VERY THIN PARTNER
He's probably at a friend‘s house.

PEGGY
He has difficulty making friends.

JOSEPH
There's that trashy Danielle girl.

PEGGY
I wish you hadn’t encouraged that.
“JOSEPH ,
Are you questioning my ability to
parent effectively?

PEGGY
He took up with that girl and now
he's gone. Perhaps you shouldn't
have forced him is all.

JOSEPH
Shut up, woman.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Does this Danielle girl have long
curly hair?

JOSEPH
Yes.

VERY THIN PARTNER
A cherry red mustang?

JOSEPH
Yes.

VERY THIN PARTNER

lady back trouble in the future?

JOSEPH
That’s her.

CLARKE
Bag of pork rinds.
DANIELLE
Gimmie your dad's credit card.
CLARKE
Huh?
DANTELLE

You still got his card, right?
CLARKE

I don't think he’d take kindly to

fitting the bill for your trip.

DANIELLE
Our trip. You’re here too.

CLARKE
You didn’t bring any money?
DANIELLE
I got the thirty bucks Sue-Ann left
under the lamp, but we should save
our cash.

CLARKE
This was not well planned.

DANIELLE
My daddy will pay your daddy back.

Clarke hands Danielle the card.

Danielle goes inside, Clarke finishes pumping the gas. He

Yes. Clarke, honey, where are you?

CLARRE
Is daddy really mad at me?

PEGGY
You best hurry home, the way he’s

afraid of what he might do.

CLARKE
Do you still want to send me away?

PEGGY
Honey, I never wanted to send you
away. Why don’t you come home and
we'll discuss it.

CLARKE
Does daddy stiil want to send me
away?

PEGGY

Your father gets very determined
when he makes his mind up about
something.

CLARKE
rT know.

PEGGY
We’ll just have to try to convince
him together. Clarke, are you with
that girl?

Danielle appears behind Clarke. He does not notice her.

CLARKE
No.

PEGGY
She's bad news, honey.

Danielle reaches over Clarke’s shoulder and cuts off the

CLARKE
You were right. I am dead.

DANIELLE
Why don’t I drive.

INT. INSIDE THE BLUE OLDSMOBILE ON THE OPEN ROAD- ARIZONA
Danielle drives. Clarke stares vacantly out the window.

DANIELLE
Did you tell your parents where we
are? If you did I swear to god T
will pull this car over and kick
your ass out.

CLARKE
This is my car you selfish cunt!

DANIELLE
That is an ugly, hateful word.

CLARKE
I learned it from you.

DANIELLE
Well it's not nice to call people
names to their face. Especially a
friend.
564.

CLARKE
Are you my friend?

Danielle will not answer this. She stiffens and returns to
the matter at hand.

DANTELLE
Are you gettin’ cold feet?

Clarke does not answer.

_ DANIELLE (CONT'D)
Why is it that every pussy I know
has a dick attached? You can’t
count on men for shit.

CLARKE
You’re runnin’ toward somethin’.
I'm just runnin' away.

DANIELLE
Ain’t that just poetic.

CLARKE
You're gettin’ to live your dream,
I’m just gettin’ into deeper shit.
(then)
You're not even nice to me.

DANIELLE
Did you tell them where we are?

CLARKE
Maybe I did. Maybe I didn‘t.

DANIELLE
Oh I get it we're playing mind
games now. Did you learn that from
your therapist?

CLARKE
You haven’t even said thank you.

DANIELLE
(put off}
Well, some things go without
saying.
57.

CLARKE
Then, I guess it goes without
saying that I think you are the
neatest person I have ever known,
and I feel less afraid when I’m
around you, cause you‘re braver
then I'll ever be. And it also goes
without saying, I would never tell
on you.

DANIELLE
You didn’t tell?

Clarke shakes his head no,

DANIELLE (CONT'D)
I promise I'll find some way to
thank you.

EXT. DANIELLE’S DOUBLE WIDE- SUNSET
Joseph eyes Danielle’s mustang in the carport.

He goes to the front door, knocks on it vigorously, but there
is no answer.

He walks around the side of the trailer, peaks in through the
window, sees his son’s backpack inside.

Joseph removes the vertical slats of glass in the window,
sets them on the floor inside. He hikes his injured foot
through the window first and awkwardly pulls himself through
the opening.

one good heave and he thrusts himself into SUE-ANN’S BEDROOM,
landing ass first on the slats of glass.

JOSEPH
AHHHHHA!!

ACROSS THE STREET

A FAT FEMALE NEIGHBOR (tragic, but jolly) heats up her franks
n’ beans in a dirty microwave. She hears Joseph's pained
scream, looks out her window to see him hopping around
freakishly.

FAT FEMALE NEIGHBOR

911! 911!

INT. POLICE STATION- NIGHT

Joseph stands behind bars in darkness. Very Thin Partner
clicks his tongue disapprovingly. .

VERY THIN PARTNER
You should of left it to the
professionals. Breaking and
entering, was that really
necessary? Couldn’t you have
called, wouldn't that have been the
neighborly thing to do?

JOSEPH
My son is a troubled boy.

VERY THIN PARTNER
My friend, all sons are troubled.

JOSEPH
I need to see a doctor, my ass is
bleeding.

VERY THIN PARTNER
You think that’s news around here?
I‘ll see if I can round you up a
band-aid.

Very thin partner exits.

Joseph heads over to the toilet, gathers up a wad of toilet

paper. He unbuckles his pants, reaches around to pat down his
injury. Not only can he not reach it, but he can’t quite see
it either. He struggles, then out of the darkness he hears...

MAN'S VOICE
You need some help with that,
Chief?
A BIG BIKER DUDE (late thirties, 2Z-Top beard) emerges from
the shadows.

Int. A SHITTY DAY’S INN LOBBY- NIGHT

A CONCIERGE (Male early 20’s, but has yet to outgrow acne) is
asleep behind the counter. Danielle nudges him awake.

DANIELLE :
Me and my husband need a room.
59.

CONCTERGE
Can‘t rent you a room unless you‘re
eighteen.

DANIELLE

But this here's our wedding night.

CONCIERGE
I’m onto you two.
(then to Danielle)
You're Jimmy’s new girl ain’t ya?
they just keep getting younger and
younger.

CLARKE ©
This is my wife. We were married
this afternoon.

DANIELLE
(whispering)
Sort of a shotgun situation.

CONCIERGE
I know how it is when you want get
your nut for the first time. We've
all been there. You‘re smart to use
a workin’ girl, gets everything out
of the way, no fuss, no muss. I
assume you'll be paying cash.

CLARKE
Credit.

Clarke reaches for his dad's card.
CONCIERGE
{re: Danielle)
You know she don’t take cards?

DANIELLE
He knows.

Clarke signs the slip. The concierge hands over a key.
CONCIERGE
(winking)
I'm giving you the honeymoon suite,
You enjoy yourself now.

CLARKE
Thanks.

Clarke and Danielle head to the elevator.
CONCIERGE
{calling to Danielle}
Jimmy usually sends me over a free
sample.

DANIELLE
You can work that out with Jimmy.

Danielle and Clarke step onto the ELEVATOR.
CLARKE

He can’t tell the difference
between a slut and a hooker.

DANIELLE
I’m not a slut.

CLARKE
Okay.

DANIELLE

Just because I've had sex with
many, many, many men, doesn’t make
me a slut. You forget, I
discriminate.

CLARKE
Jesus, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize
it was such a touchy subject.
DANIELLE
Yeah, well when was the last time
someone thought you were a hooker?

CLARKE
Never.

DANIELLE
Well then, there you go.

CLARKE
But I wish someone would.

The elevator door opens.

RAY
Now Mindy, your brother and I
killed this special for you, and
Sue~Ann‘s been slaving away. Time
to show a little appreciation.

Mindy licks her fish.

MINDY
Tastes poopy. ~

SUE-ANN .
It's always hard to try new things.
I understand.

Sue-Ann winks at Mindy.

RAY
Isn’t this fun all of us here
together? Makes a man thankful.

Mindy takes a bite of her fish, swallows it.

SUE-ANN
I wish Danielle were here to see
how nice things are working out.

Mindy projectile vomits across the table.

INT. HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT,

Clarke lays on the vibrating bed. Joan, the flour baby, is
next to him. His whole body shakes. He begins to sing, the
bed gives his voice the added vibrato of a chipmunk.

Joan slowly, but surely bounces closer and closer to the edge
of the bed...

CLARKE
(singing)
Ooco, baby do you know what that's
worth? You make heaven a place on
earth...
62.

HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM

We can hear Clarke’s Belinda Carlisle impersonation from the
other room. Danielle, fresh out of the shower, wrapped in a
white towel, performs for herself in the mirror.

DANIELLE

We were just passin’ through,
thought we'd stop off and say
hello.

(tries another)
People tell me all the time how
much we Look alike, and its true,
isn’t it?

She notices the hickey on her neck left by Big Mike.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
Shit.

She grabs a piece of ice from the ice bucket, and presses it
to her hickey.

Back on the BED, Joan finally falls off the mattress and onto
the floor. A small puff of flour escapes.

Danielle enters from the bathroom.

DANIELLE
(re: Hickey)
No wonder he thought I was a
hooker, I look like a fuckin’
leper. Where’s Joan?

Clarke looks around. Scrambles to the side of the bed, looks
over the edge to see Joan on her head.

CLARKE
Oops.
DANIELLE
You gotta be more careful with her.
CLARKE
Sorry.
DANIELLE

How would you like to be dropped on
your head?
63.

CLARKE
I have been dropped on my head.
Daddy says, momma dropped me and
that's what accounts for my
feminine ways.

DANIELLE
So you wanna make Joan a lesbian.
Nice. You gays always trying to
convert everybody.

Clarke laughs.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
(picking Joan up)
Well, I don’t see any damage. None
that Mrs. Hatcher would notice
anyway.

CLARKE
If you're not going back, why are
“you worried about your grade?

DANIELLE
Go to sleep. We gotta long day
tomorrow.

CLARKE
Have you ever tried magic fingers?

Danielle lays down on the bed next to Clarke, Joan between
them. Clarke puts a quarter in the machine.

The bed vibrates.
CLARKE
Now do this.
{he opens his mouth)
Ahhhhhhhh!

DANIELLE
Ahhhhbhhh!

Joan and her parents jiggle happily on the bed.

She wasn't this fat when I married

The Officer begins to unlock the cell.

glass in my ass cause of that boy.

JOSEPH
He has humiliated me for the last

PEGGY

You're the humiliation. Drag me
away from that phone, cause you've
gone off and lost it again. Our son
could have called and here I am
bailing my husband out of jail.

JOSEPH
Open the God Damn door.

PEGGY
Officer, if I refuse to take my
husband right now, what's gonna
happen?

JOSEPH

heads out the window to get some fresh air.

RAY
8o much for family time.

SUE-~ANN
I never made cat fish before.

Sue-ann looks to Ray, he says nothing.

SUE-ANN (CONT’D AS RAY)
"No baby it isn’t your fault. I
know you were doing your best.”

Silence,

Pull over!

Ray jumps out of the car and hurls in the bushes.

Sue-Ann looks away, notices a sign along the side of the road
that reads, "No fishing due to spill.”

INT. INSIDE THE BLUE OLDSMOBILE- I-40, NEW MEXICO- MORNING
Clarke and Danielle speed closer to their destination.

CLARKE (V.O. AS JOAN)
Dear Diary, New Mexico is a great
big bore.

Clarke writes in a spiral notebook.

CLARKE {V.O. AS JOAN)
Mom does most of the driving

too slow. Daddy is happy, being a

a most excellent map reader.

CLARKE (V.O. AS JOAN) (cont'd)
With the division of labor so
neatly divided, and both of them
willing to stay in their designated
roles, I am convinced that T have
the happiest family there ever was.

Danielle turns up the music, this time it’s Blondie’s
Rapture.

The Rap Section of Rapture comes on, Clarke and Danielle have
choreographed hand movements to it. They look like the best
friends the world has ever known.

BLONDIE
“Pab Five Freddie told me
everything was fine/ DJ spinning he
said, my my...and you don’t stop,
do the punk rock”

They pass a HITCHHIKER (early 20's, great ass). The sight of
him shuts Clarke up.

CLARKE
Did you see that guy? Pull over I
want to ask him if those are Bugle
Boy jeans he’s wearing.

DANIELLE
Press on we must Clarke, press on
we must.

CLARKE

You're the one who keeps saying you
need to get me laid.

DANIELLE
You’re not his type, Clarke.

CLARKE
And you are?

DANIELLE.
I’m everybody’s type.

CLARKE
Where do you get your confidence?

DANIELLE
It's the natural result of having
one’s beauty repeatedly affirmed.
The more people tell you you're
hot, the more you're gonna believe
it. “

CLARKE
Nobody nowhere’s has ever called me
hot.

Sue-Ann, Ray, Charley and Mindy pull into the drive way.
Peggy stirs at the sound of their car, but does not wake up.

SUE-ANN
Everybody go on in and lay down.

MINDY
Can I sleep in Danielle's room?

Peggy wakes up at the sound of their voices.

SUE-ANN
You can sleep wherever you want.
Ray? I got a set of big bowls under
the stove make sure everybody’s got
one.

PEGGY
Excuse me? This is incredibly
embarrassing, but I am a desperate
woman. I have reason to believe my
son has run off with your daughter.

SUE-ANN

I shoulda never left that brat
alone. Listen, I got a house full
of sick people, horny children are
the least of my worries right now.
They're gonna turn up. They always
do.

PEGGY
My son is gay.

Sue-Ann stops on the steps.

That's the first time I’ve ever

Peggy follows Sue-Ann into the trailer.

The house is just as Danielle and Clarke left it, a complete

RAY
Sue-Ann, there’s glass all over
your bedroom floor.

PEGGY
My husband's a might high strung

sure to take care of any damages.

Sue-Ann notices the family tree left behind on the coffee
table. She picks it up and touches the name, "Danny Briggs”.

SUE~ANN
Oh my god..

In walks the sexy hitchhiker Clarke and Danielle passed
earlier. He takes the urinal next to Clarke.

Clarke peers over casually and is shocked to see whe it is.
The Hitchhiker peers back, smiles knowingly.
Clarke goes to wash his hands. The Hitchhiker soon follows,
the two make eye contact through the mirror. Clarke quickly
looks away, and heads for the door.
He stops just short of exiting, turns and asks...

CLARKE

Excuse Tey are those bugle boy

The Hitchhiker smiles.

DANIELLE
This is a distraction from the

JOEL

CLARKE

JOEL
I’m not all that technical, I’m
more free form.

CLARKE
Can you do the splits?
73.

DANIELLE
You dance for tips, right? That‘’s
why you got all those singles.

JOEL
It's my art, if people want to give
me money for my art, that just
makes me a professional artist.

DANIELLE
You're a stripper.

JOEL
Erotic entertainer.

DANIELLE
Stripper.

CLARKE

Lots of people can't make a living

I’m going to take care of it and

This isn’t about anything else but

An awkward silence sits between Peggy and Sue-Ann.
A man across the aisle begins to snore. The moms notice him.

Sue-Ann takes Peggy's hand. They are a team.

Joel is stoking a fire. Danielle and Clarke are huddled in a

JOEL
Are we competing?

DANIELLE
I’m just saying I probably had it
worse.

JOEL

You know what it's like then, don’t
you? That crazy thing when you look
for him everywhere. Anytime you're
in a crowd, there’s a chance, so
you walk around a little straighter
hoping to look your best just in
case. I could never be on the
freeway, my neck would get so sore,
looking in every car window,
thinking one of these guys is my
daddy. Looking everywhere for
somebody who don't want to be
found. You got that look Danny,
like me.

Oh yeah?

there's that little teeny tiny bit

DANIELLE
The artist wants a ballad.

Danielle fast forwards the tape to the next song, The Bangles

JOEL
I can’t believe I am doing this out
in the middle of nowhere. You best
appreciate it.

Promise I do.

Danielle stays back by the car. This show is for Clarke.
79.

Joel begins to move slowly in headlights. He is a terrible
dancer, but there is something raw in his movements that make
him attractive. It is the utter conviction that even without
any sense of discernible rhythm, he is sexy. He unbuttons his
shirt.

Clarke takes a deep nervous breath.

Danielle wraps herself in the covers they stole from the
Day's Inn, picks up Joan, and walks away, leaving Clarke and
Joel alone.

Joel begins to unbutton his pants.

Clarke pulls out a dollar bill, holds it up.

Joel grooves over to Clarke. Clarke tucks the bill into
Joel’s pants.

Joel takes Clarke's hand and pulis him to his feet.

He takes off Clarke's glasses and kisses him. The two dance
close for a moment.

Joel leaves Clarke in the headlights, gets into the backseat
of the Oldsmobile.

Clarke is blinded and nervous, standing next to the fire in ,
the harsh headlights.

JOEL
Come on then.

THE BANGLES
Is this burning an eternal flame?

Joel extends his hand, Clarke takes it and gets into the
backseat.

Danielle leans against the billboard next to Joan.
DANIELLE
Well Joan, what do ya know? Daddy‘s
a man now.

EXT. THE SAME FIELD BY THE FREEWAY- THE NEXT MORNING.

Clarke wakes up in the backseat of the Oldsmobile with a
smile on his face.

Joel is nowhere in sight.
80.

INT. INSIDE THE OLDSMOBILE ON THE OPEN ROAD, SOMEWHERE IN THE
DESERT- DAY

Clarke sits in the backseat looking out the window forlornly.
Danielle, as always is at the wheel.

DANIELLE
I know you don’t want to hear this
right now, but you’ll get over it.

CLARKE
I fell in love last night, and now
he's gone. My one chance at
happiness. .

DANTELLE
Stop acting like a girl.

CLARKE
You drove him away.

DANIELLE
Clarke, I’m gonna stop thie
conversation right now while you re-
adjust your thinking.

CLARKE
Welcome to life, Clarke. You're
jast another tainted grown up.

DANIELLE
Jesus Christ.

c
There is no room in the world for a
love like ours, they hate us for
it. Such a fragile thing, too
beautiful and precious for this
world. You will never be safe in
this land of jealous saboteurs.

The Oldsmobile stalis. Danielle looks at the gas gage. Empty.

DANIELLE
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

Danielle gets out and kicks the car repeatedly, making a huge
dent.

DANIELLE
You fucking bitch!
gi.

CLARKE
Joel would know what to do, if he
were here.

DANIELLE
We best start walking.
CLARKE ~
Yes, you best.

DANIELLE
Clarke, let’s go.

CLARKE
You're the one with the reason to
live, You walk.

DANIELLE
Okay when I get to the next town,
I’m gonna call your father and tell
him his son is waiting for him with
a torn rectum in his stolen car 20
miles East of Reno.

Clarke presses eject on the stereo, puts the mix tape in his
headphones and gets out of the car. He walks three paces
behind Danielle as he listens to his headphones.

Joan, the flour baby, is left behind.

EXT. HOME OF DANNY AND JANET BRIGGS- MORNING

A Taxi stops in front of a small, white, perfectly manicured
house. A suburban dream. Peggy and Sue-Ann get out.

SUE-ANN
Do I look okay?

Peggy smiles, and the two head up the walkway.

EXT. ROADSIDE- SOMEWHERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT- LATER

A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulls up behind the car on his
motorcycle.

Joan sits in the backseat of the Oldsmobile, where her
parents left her.
82.

INT. POLICE STATION- DAY
Very thin partner opens the cell for Joseph.

VERY THIN PARTNER
Alright mister, your time is up.

JOESEPH
{to Big Biker Dude)
I wish I could say it's’ been a
pleasure.

BIG BIKER DUDE
You be good to that boy of yours.

JOESEPH
Or what? He’ll end up like you.

BIG BIKER DUDE
No. He'll end up like you.

VERY THIN PARTNER
We found your car,
EXT. OKALHOMA CITY ATRPORT- DAY
An airplane takes off.
INSIDE THE AIRPLANE

A STEWARDESS offers Joeseph some peanuts.

EXT. ROADSIDE- SOMEWHERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT~ LATER

Danielle walks with her thumb out trying to hitch a ride.
Clarke still trails her.

CLARKE
Might as well put your arm down,
ain’t no cars coming.
Danielle scowls at Clarke.
Just then, Clarke's tape stops.

CLARKE
Shit. Fucking batteries.
83.

DANIELLE
Guess you’re gonna have to talk to
me now.

CLARKE
Never.

DANIELLE

He didn’t leave because of me. He
left because that’s the kind of guy
he is.

CLARKE
It really bugs you don't it? That a
man found me more attractive then
you. Maybe you're just not as cute
as you used to be.

A semi~truck comes barreling down the freeway.

DANIELLE
Oh yeah?

Danielle sticks out her thumb. The truck squacks to a halt at
the sight of her.

DANIELLE
E still got it, bitch.

INT. SEMI-TRUCK- LATER

Clarke and Danielle are squeezed in with the most HIDEOUS
TOOTHLESS TRUCKER the world has ever seen.

HIDEOUS TOOTHLESS TRUCKER
You two are lucky I came along,
it's hotter then blazes out there,
wouldn’t want a pretty thing like
you gettin’ dehydrated.

CLARKE
(to Danielle)
What’s that word you're always
using to describe yourself?
Discriminating.

INT. GAS STAION OUTSIDE OF VEGAS- EVENING

A SWEATY ATTENDANT (40's, inexplicable hair) stands behind a
counter ringing Danny and Clarke up.
NY

CLARKE

Cash.

84,

SWEATY ATTENDANT
Tank of gas, will be fifteen
dollars. My son’ll drive you back
to your car. Will that be cash or
charge?

DANIELLE
Charge.

CLARKE
I’m sick of paying your way. You
are hateful and ungrateful.

DANIELLE
Don’t be an asshole. You‘re just as
stuck as T am.

CLARKE

You got an emergency fund. Use it.
DANIELLE

I can't.
CLARKE

Why spend your own money when you
can spend someone else's?

DANIELLE
I don’t have it anymore.

CLARKE
You spent it! The only cash we
have? You aré such a selfish bitch.
What did you buy yourself?

DANIELLE
It's what I bought you!

Clarke is truly confused.

DANIELLE (CONT'D)
I wanted to do something nice for
you. To thank you.

Clarke still doesn’t get it.

DANIELLE (CONT‘D)
And you liked him so much.

Tt dawns on Clarke slowly.
85.

CLARKE
He didn’t think I was sexy?

DANIELLE
I’m sure he did. It was just extra
encouragement.
Clarke is dumbfounded, he turns and heads for the door.
DANIELLE (CONT!D)
(yelling)
Clarke!
Clarke stops.

DANIELLE (CONT’D)
I need your credit card.

Clarke takes the credit card out of his pocket and throws it
at Danielie. Unfortunately, because he throws like a girl it
doesn’t hit her, rather, lands limply right in front of him.
Exasperated, Clarke exits.
The Attendant gives Danielle a confused look.
DANIELLE
(off look)
That’s what I get for marrying a
faggot.

The Attendant swipes the card.

EXT. THE SAME GAS STAT[ON- MOMENTS LATER
Clarke diais a number at the PAY PHONE.

CLARKE
Yes. Collect. From Clarke.

Suddenly, Danielle bursts out of the gas station.

DANIELLE
Clarke! Run!

Danielle grabs Clarke, pulls him from the phone booth.
Bewildered, Clarke tears off after her, leaving the receiver
dangling.

The Attendant barrels out of the Gas Station
86.

SWEATY ATTENDANT
Hey! Get back here!

Clarke and Danielle duck behind a dumpster.

CLARKE
What the fuck?
DANIELLE
Your card's been reported stclen.
CLARKE
That’s what we get for breaking the
rules.
DANTELLE

They're gonna know we're here.
Shit! Shit! Shit!

CLARKE
So, it's over.

DANIELLE
Now that you got what you wanted,
you want to throw in the towel?

CLARKE
I want. to call my mom.

Aeross the street Danielle spots a neon sign that says, “The
Bullet”, and below that in plastic, changeable letters
“Amateur Strip Contest.”

DANIELLE

Come on.

Danielle crosses the freeway toward “The Bullet”. Clarke
reluctantly follows.

The Gas Station Attendant watches as Clarke and Danielle
enter the bar.

EXT. ROADSIDE- SOMEWHERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT-~ LATER

A tow truck pulls the Oldsmobile away. Joan doesn't have her

seat belt on and so tumbles into the rear window. Her face
seems to let out a scream as it is pressed to the glass.
87.

INT. THE BULLET—- LATER

The bar is smoky and crowded. Danielle goes up to a BALD DOOR
MAN in a leather vest.

DANIELLE
Hey. I want to enter the stripping
contest. Where’s the sign up sheet?

BALD DOORMAN
You’re looking at him.

DANIELLE
Great.

BALD DOORMAN
Not great. Wouldn't exactly be
appropriate, now would it?

DANTELLE
I’m young but I got the moves,
trust me. My friend can vouch for
me.

CLARKE
She's done her research.

DANIELLE
That prize money is mine. Just give
me a chance.

BALD DOORMAN
The winner is picked by the
audience, Yop think you can win
these boys over be my guest...

Upon closer inspection of the crowd, Danielle and Clarke
quickly surmise it's a gay bar.

DANIELLE
What is it with you people? You're
taking over the world.

BALD DOORMAN
You kids run along now.

They start to go.

DANIELLE
Clarke, you have to do it.
88.

CLAKRE
No way.

DANIELLE
You wanna prove you’re sexy, now's
your chance.

CLARKE
I'm sick of doing your dirty work.

DANIELLE
Don't do it for me. Do it for you.

CLARKE
These guys won’t like me.

DANIELLE
{to the doorman)
Six? You’re a hot blooded, bald,
American homosexual. Is or is not
my friend a chicken hawk’s dream?

BALD DOORMAN
Bock Bock.

DANIELLE
You see that? He clucked for you
Clarke. It’s time you stood up and
said, I'm Clarke, I'm here. I am
two tons of home fun.

CLARKE
I’m liable to piss myself.

DANIELLE
That would giarantee you a victory.
Clarke, what would Joel do?

INT. THE BULLET~ LATER

JADE, (a skinny stripper, too old to still act like a
bottom), wearing an American flag g-string finishes up his
act on THE SMALL STAGE. He picks up the two dollar bills that
were thrown at him.

JADE
Thanks mom.

ANNOUNCER
Let's hear it for last week’s
winner, Jade. Six weeks and still
undefeated.
89.

JADE (0.8.)
Seven.

Danielle hands the Announcer Clarke’s tape.

ANNCUNCER
I stand corrected, seven weeks
undefeated, and might I add,
uncontested.

Clarke runs out on stage with a cane back chair, sets it
center stage, and nervously runs back to the wings.

ANNOUNCER
But not this week. Direct from
tornado alley. Don’t call him jail
bait, don’t call him chicken, just
call him...

The lights fade. The opening strains of Blondie's “Call Me”
burn through the sound system.

Clarke takes the stage timidly. His knee pulses to the music.
All he can muster in terms of dance is snapping his fingers.

HECKLER 1
Take it off.

JADE’S MOM
You suck.

Clarke begins to unbutton his shirt, trying to move like
Joel.

DANIELLE
(to announcer)
Turn it up.

The music gets louder. Clarke closes his eyes and lets the
music carry him away.

The music segues to “Manhunt” from the Flashdance soundtrack.

Clarke rips off his shirt, revealing an undershirt that has
been cut ala Jennifer Beals in Flashdance.

DANIELLE
Woooac0ce!

The crowd starts to get into it. Clarke pulls off his pants.
In just his Flashdance T-shirt, BVD's and black socks he
mounts a cane back chair.
90.

This is Danielle's cue. She rushes the stage with a bucket of
water and douses Clarke.

The Audience goes crazy! They start throwing money at the
stage, singles, fives, tens....

The song ends. Clarke Basks in the glow of his clear victory.
He is sexy, Damn it!

Danielle crawls abcut the stage gathering up the money.

ANNOUNCER
By an overwhelming margin, the
winner of the fifty dollar prize
money, and new champ is ....

An unmistakable voice shouts out...

JOSEPH
Clarke!

Joseph is revealed in the back of the bar standing with the
sweaty gas station attendant.

INT. INSIDE THE OLDSMOBILE- HEADING HOME

Clarke and Danielle ride in the backseat, like guilty
troublemakers. Joseph drives.

JOSEPH
It's over for you boy, soon as we
drop off your little friend here
it’s straight to the academy with
you.

Clarke, still dripping wet, stares out the window.

DANIELLE
You have no right to kidnap me, you
ugly mother fucker.

JOSEPH
And I'll hear no lip from you, it’s
because of you my son has gone off
the deep end.

DANIELLE
Your son was a miserable, whiny
douche bag before I got my hands on
him.
91.

JOSEPH
And turned him into a cock sucker.

DANIELLE
Mister, for a man clearly desperate
to get his tool drained, it
wouldn't be wise to knock the
willing.

JOSEPH
Don’t make me pull this car over.

CLARKE
What are you gonna do, huh? Smack

her around? Knock some sense into
her?

JOSEPH .
That's enough out of you.

Clarke slips Danielle the wad of money. She shoots him a,
What are you doing? look.

CLARKE
I tell you what. I like cocks! The
bigger the better.

. JOSEPH

Don’t make me come back there.
CLARKE

I like the dreamy, creamy taste.
JOSEPH

Shut up! .
CLARKE

Somebody pass me a cracker for that

cheese!

Joseph pulls the car over, gets out and heads for Clarke’s
side of the car.

DANIELLE
Don't you hurt him!

CLARKE
(to Danielle)
If I'm good at anything, it's how
to take a punch.

Joseph opens the door, grabs Clarke, and pulls him from the
car.
92.

CLARKE (CONT‘D)
Run! Now!

Joseph throws Clarke to the ground. Danielle can’t leave him.

CLARKE
Got

Danielle grabe her bag and Joan and takes off across the
freeway.

Joseph notices the escape.
JOSEPH
(to Danielle)
You get back here you two bit slut!

Joseph tries to chase Danielle, but is hindered by the
traffic.

Danielle runs up the freeway with her thumb out.

A station wagon pulls over. Danielle dives in, and is gone.

EXP. VEGAS BUS STATION- NIGHT.

The station wagon pulls up to the bus stop. Danielle gets
out.

INT. VEGAS BUS STATION- LATER

Danielle waits on a bench with Joan. Over the loudspeaker we
hear...

ANNOUNCER
Now boarding 12:15 bus to Fresno,
with stops in Barstow, Bakersfield
and Visalia.

EXT. VEGAS BUS STATION- LATER

Danielle boards a bus headed for Fresno.

A friendly male BUS DRIVER (40's, with a kind face) greets
Danielle as she boards.

BUS DRIVER
You travelling alone little girl?
93.

DANIELLE
Yep.

BUS DRIVER
sit up front behind me, then. Some
sketchy characters on these buses.

Danielle takes the seat directly behind the bus driver. ~

INT. ON THE FRESNO BOUND BUS- LATER

Danielle can‘t sleep. She holds Joan tight and looks out the
window.

BUS DRIVER
Don’t mind that sign says you can’t
talk to me. I like it. Helps keep
me awake.

DANIELLE
You're a little old for me.

BUS DRIVER
You think I’m hitting on you? Can't
say I don’t blame you for the
misunderstanding. What are you
‘bout 16?

DANIELLE
Most people say I look older.

BUS DRIVER

Well you don’t. My daughter’s your
age, ever since she begun to fill
out, every man, every age seems to
hit on her some way. Not when I'm
around, mind you. Men know better
then to hit on your little girl
right in front of you.

DANIELLE
You're a good dad?

BUS DRIVER
Not perfect, but I try.

DANTELLE
I’m going to see my daddy.

BUS DRIVER
Been a while since you’ve seen him?
94.

DANTELLE
Forever.

BUS DRIVER
He's gonna be happy to see you.
Somethin’ about daddies and their
little girls. It's its own kind of
love.

Danielle looks out the window and smiles.

EXT. FRESNO BUS STOP- THE NEXT MORNING

Danielle gets off the bus, heads for the taxi stand, but
turns and goes inside the station.

INT. FRESNO BUS STOP- LADIES ROOM- MOEMENTS LATER.

Danielle stands before the mirror. She pulis out her make-up
case and begins to freshen up.

She stops, pulls her hair back, looking for the hickey that
Mike left her. It's gone.

She turns on the faucet and washes off all of her makeup.

INT. TAXI

Looking fresh and clean for the first time ever, Danielle
passes the suburban houses of Fresno.

She looks at the photo strip of her mother and father, takes
a deep breath. .

EXT. HOME OF DANNY AND JANET BRIGGS-— LATER

The taxi pulls up to the house. Danielle does not get out.

TAXI DRIVER
We're here.

DANIELLE
I know.

TAXI DRIVER
Means you can get out now.

DANIELLE
Okay.
95.

Danielle gets out of the taxi.

TAXI DRIVER
You still gotta pay me.

DANIELLE
Right, I’m sorry.

Danielle gives the cabby his money, then slowly makes her way
up the long concrete walk.

At the FRONT DOOR she hesitates. She cannot bring herself to
ring the doorbell.

Fuck it, she seems to say to herself, she almost rings the
doorbell, when the door opens. Danielle looks up.

Sue-Ann stands in the doorway before her.

SUE-ANN
You got some explaining to do.

DANIELLE
Where‘s my father?

SUE-ANN
Danielle, it's best if we just go
on home now.

A horsy blonde woman, JANET, peers through the front drapes,
gives Danielle the once over.

Peggy appears in the doorway behind Sue~Ann.

DANIELLE
(ver:Janet in the window)
Is that his wife?

SUE-ANN
Yes it is.

DANIELLE
Can I say hello to her?

SUE-ANN
Peggy and I have caused these
people enough trouble. It's time we
get out of their hair.

. PEGGY
Where‘s my boy?
Ne

96.

DANIELLE
His daddy found us. They’re
together now.

PEGGY
Jesus.

DANIELLE
Can I just come in? I‘m really
tired, and I need to use the
bathroom.

PEGGY
Tf he’s hurt I am going to hold you
personally responsible, young lady.

SUE-ANN
The three of us are gonna go to the
airport and head on back to
Oklahoma, and when we get there
we'll get all our feelings squared
away.

Danielle sees Janet pass in the hallway beyond.

DANIELLE
{calling out, getting more
desperate)
Janet? That’s your name right? Can
I use your bathroom? I just need to
go. Is that okay?

Janet heads upstairs.

Danielle tries to force her way in, but Sue-Ann and Peggy
block the door. Danielle runs around the back of the house.

SUE-ANN
Danielle!

Danielle will not stop. In the BACKYARD she is stopped cold
by the sight of DANNY BRIGGS (a handsome 37 year-old, gone
slightly to seed). His back is to his daughter as he grills
some hamburgers.

DANIELLE
Danny Briggs?

He does not turn around.

DANNY BRIGGS
You Sue-Ann's little girl?
97.

DANIELLE
Uh-huh.

He turns to look at her.

DANNY BRIGGS
If you aren’t the spittin’ image of
your mother.

DANIELLE
People think we’re sisters all the
time.

Janet storms out of the back door.

JANET
You can’t be here!

DANNY BRIGGS
It's okay, Janet.

JANET
Daniel. This is not what we
discussed.

DANNY BRIGGS
Just go on inside.

JANET
(to Danielle)
Say your peace and be on your way.

Janet. goes back inside.

DANNY BRIGGS
Don’t mind hér. She‘s upset.

DANIELLE
Them boys you sold the house to
said she was kinda high strung and
all. I was prepared in my
mentality.

DANNY BRIGGS
Shows that you’re a smart girl.
(then)
You know the trick to making
hamburgers on the grill is to only
flip ‘em once.

Danielle rushes to her father and throws her arms around him.
98.

Sue-Ann and Peggy stand at the gate watching. Peggy leads Sue~
Ann away.

DANNY BRIGGS
(rationalizing to himself)
Okay. Okay.

DANIELLE
I knew it. I knew I’d find you.

DANNY BRIGGS
This wasn’t supposed to be like
this. Your mother was just gonna
take you home... .

DANIELLE
But I'm here now.

DANNY BRIGGS
Yes. I guess you are.

DANIELLE
And we never have to be apart
again.

DANNY BRIGGS
Sweetie. I think you and I need to
have a talk. A real good talk.

Danielle sits down eagerly on at the picnic table.

DANIELLE
We can talk about anything you
want. We don’t have to force
nothing. We can just sit here and
wait til one’of us, or both of us,
is inspired.

DANNY BRIGGS
Danielle honey, the last couple of
days have been real strange for me,
I hadn’t seen your mama in a long,
long time.

DANIELLE
Must've been weird. Seventeen years
is a long time not to see somebody.

DANNY BRIGGS
Yes, that was weird.

DANIELLE
Super duper weird.
 

99.

DANNY BRIGGS
Yes, I guess, super duper weird.

DANIELLE
She's a real hag, ain’t she? Not
the fine thing you fell in love
with.

DANNY BRIGGS
Danny, I didn’t know about you.

DANIELLE
She didn’t tell you?

DANNY BRIGGS
Well, no, not exactly... I thought
she had goten rid of it.
(then)
You gotta understand. We weren’t in
love, we just liked hanging out I
guess.

DANIELLE
You're wrong. She loved you. She
named me after you.

DANNY BRIGGS
I’m not proud of myself. Sometimes
people act on their impulses, and
it doesn’t always work out for the
best.

DANIELLE
She decided to keep me?

DANNY BRIGGS
I had no idea.

DANIELLE
You know what this means?

DANNY BRIGGS
What?

DANIELLE
It means I don’t have to forgive
you for runnin’ out on us. I was
kind of looking forward to that.

DANNY BRIGGS
If you would forgive me anyway, it
would mean a lot to me.
100.

DANTELLE
Done.

DANNY BRIGGS
You must've missed a lot of school
coming to see me.

DANIELLE
Just a couple of days. I brought my
homework.

DANNY BRIGGS
Bet you're in a hurry to get back:

DANIELLE
I don't know what Sue-Ann has told
you, but our situation ain‘t really
ideal.

DANNY BRIGGS
Uh-huh.

DANIELLE
I know it's a shock, me being here
and all, but if it's alright, and I
know it would take a lot of
adjustin’ for everybody...

DANNY BRIGGS
You can't stay here, honey.

DANIELLE
I'll keep my room real nice.

DANNY BRIGGS
I’m sure you'wonld, it just
wouldn't be right is all.

DANIELLE
Families are suppose@ to be
together, it's what’s natural.

DANNY BRIGGS
Danielle, I’m a stranger.

DANTELLE
You're my daddy.

DANNY BRIGGS
You seem like a real nice girl and
all, and I'm sure I’d be real proud
of you...
101.

DANIELLE
Don't bet on it.

DANNY BRIGGS
But...

A CHILD'S VOICE from the back door.

CHILD'S VOICE
Daddy, who’s that? oe

TIFFANY BRIGGS (8) is revealed in the doorway.
DANNY BRIGGS
Just one of daddy’s students. You
go on up and take your nap like a
good girl.

Tiffany defies her father and heads over to Danielle anyway.

TIFFANY

What's your name?
DANIELLE

I'm Danielle, what’s your's?
TIFFANY

Tiffany, and you know what?
DANIELLE

What?
TIFFANY

My daddy is gonna take me to
Disneyland on my birthday.

DANIBLLE
Well, that makes you a real lucky
girl.
TIFFANY
Are you in my daddy’s class?
DANIELLE
Yes.
TIFFANY

The only time his students come
here is when they're failing. Are
you failing?

DANIELLE
Yes.
J

a

102.

Danny Briggs picks up Tiffany and begins tickling her.
Tiffany screams gleefully.

DANNY BRIGGS
Tickle monster, coming to get you!

TIFFANY
Nooooolli!!

DANNY BRIGGS
You gonna go upstairs, take your
nap?

TIFFANY
Bye, Danielle.

DANIELLE
Bye, Tiffany.

"iffany runs back into the house.

DANNY BRIGGS
Sorry about that.

DANIELLE
She's real cute.

DANNY BRIGGS
That she is.

DANIELLE
Ske must be your pride and joy,
huh?

DANNY BRIGGS
You could sa} that.

A long awkward silence as missed years pass between them.

DANIELLE
I think I need to go, huh?

DANNY BRIGGS
Probably be a good idea.

Danielle turns to go.

DANNY BRIGGS
Danielle? You be a good girl now.
103.

EXT. HOME OF DANNY AND JANET BRIGGS, FRONT YARD- MOMENTS
LATER.

Peggy sits on the front stoop as Sue~Ann paces nervously.
Danielle appears from the side of the house.
DANIELLE
{sobbing)
Mommy?

Sue-Ann rushes to her daughter, and throws her arms around
her.

DANIELLE (CONT'D)
I’m so stupid. I'm so stupid.
INT. AIRPLANE
Danielle sits between Peggy and her mother. She is asleep
with her head-on Sue-Ann’s shoulder.
INT. DANIELLE’S BEDROOM- LATER
Danielle enters her room to find Mindy asleep in her bed.

She stands on a chair and begins removing the collage of men
from her walls.

Sue-ann enters.

SUE~ANN
Can I do anything for you, baby?

. DANIELLE
Bring me a trash can?
EXT. CLARKE‘S HOUSE-DAY

Danielle pulls up in her Mustang, gets out of the car and
rings the doorbell. No answer.

Peggy appears from around the side of the house, taking the
trash to the curb.

DANIELLE
Mrs. Gardner?
PEGGY
What are you doing here?

DANIELLE
I wanted to know how Clarke‘s
doing.

PEGGY .
He's going to be fine. It’s all |.
gonna be fine. You just go on...

DANIELLE
Is he at that school?

. PEGGY
There's so much going on here. It's
the. best place for him right now.

DANIELLE
He must totaily hate it.

PEGGY
I’ve got to figure a few things
out.

DANIELLE
I'm sorry if I caused you any
problems.

PEGGY
Honey, our problems started long
before you.

DANIELLE
Where's his daddy?

PEGGY
He's getting himself a little
apartment.

DANIELLE
I broke up your family. I’m sorry.

PEGGY
Sometimes things need to get broken
so's they can be fixed. I’m not the
person I should be. We got these
ideas about what being a good
parent is. As long as we're doing
our best that's all that matters,
but it’s not true. I mean, if your
best stinks, what good are you?

104,
10s.

DANIELLE
Clarke would rather be with you.

PEGGY
All those times I let him hurt my
son. I'm not what’s best.

DANIELLE
I don’t mean to do you no
disrespect, Mam, but that’s fuckin’

stupid.
. PEGGY
You'll understand when you're
older.
DANIELLE

Will Clarke? What’s worse, growing
up with a weak mama, or no mama? He
loves you now, but he’s gonna hate
you for this.

PEGGY
This is really none of your
business,

DANIELLE

I know what it’s like to find out
you're not wanted, to find out that
for your whole life, nothing's ever
gonna be perfect. Seems to me
though you should try to make the
most of it if you love somebody.

INT. MORMON TEMPLE- pay

A MORMON PREACHER marries Sue~Ann and Ray. Danielle and Mindy
are the bridesmaids, Charlie is best man.

MORMON FREACHER
We stand before you in the eyes of
the lord and ask that he accept
this family, Sue-Ann and Ray and
their children, Charlie, Mindy and
Danielle, into his holy kingdom
everlasting.

INT. CHALLENGERS CLASS ROOM-DAY

Danielle stands alone before class with Joan, who looks
rather beaten.
106.

DANIELLE
I guess you could say that our
little girl has been through a lot
in her short life. She has learned
that sometimes you gotta accept
what life throws at you, but only
after a really good fight to find
out what you're made of. It's the
fight that will make accepting
bearable.

MRS. HATCHER
Very nice, Danielle.

DANIELLE
I'm not done.

MRS. HATCHER
okay.

DANIELLE
She also misses her daddy a whole
lot, and hopes that someday her
family will be brought back
together, because it’s fun.

INT. PRINCIPAL MULRAY’S OFFICE-DAY

Danielle sits as before in a chair across from Principal
Mulray.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
You’ve come a long way Danielle.
What happened to that girl who
would act out at the drop of the
hat?

Danielle shrugs.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
Mrs. Hatcher says you're doing
great, that you're more involved,
says you even signed up for the
talent show.

DANIELLE
I’m working at being a more
traditional kind of person.
 

107.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
I might be taking a risk here, but
if you promise that I can trust
you, I’1l put you back with the
normal kids. Can I trust you?

INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM-DAY ~

A GROUP OF BOYS finish up their act, a rather sad break
dancing routine on a square of linoleum.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
Let’s hear it for the Mid-City
Gangsters.

The Audience claps, as the boys do a choreographed bow out of
a “wave”.

PRINCIPAL MULRAY
And now the musical stylings of
Miss Danielle Edmonston.

There is mild-to-no applause.

The curtain opens, revealing Danielle in spotlight behind a
microphone.

DANIELLE
This is for my baby’s Daddy.

A piano intro...

DANIELLE

(singing as best she can,

but still rather badly)
Baby cried the day the circus came
to town/ Cause she didn‘t want
parades just passing by her/ So she
painted on a smile and she took up
with some clown/ While she danced
without a net upon the wire/ I know
a lot about her ‘cause you see,
baby is an awful lot like me/ Don’t
cry out loud/ just keep it inside
and learn how to hide your
feelings/ Fly high and proud/ and
iff you should fall/ remember you
almost had it all...

The door to the auditerium opens, revealing the silhouette of
@ mane...
108.

DANIELLE
Baby saw that when they pulled the
big top down/ They left behind her
dreams among the litter...

The man makes his way slowly down the aisle of the
auditorium. We cannot make him out fully in the darkness, but
he appears to be in uniform...

DANIELLE

And the different kind of love she
thought she had found/ There was
nothing left there but saw dust and
some glitter/ But baby can't be
broken, cause you see, she had the
finest teacher that was me, I told
her...

The man begins to sing, cutting off Danielle.

CLARKE
(singing)
Don’t exy out loud, just keep it
inside and learn how to hide your
feelings/ Fly high and proud, and
if you should fall, remember you
almost had it all!

The spotlight finds Clarke in the aisle, dressed to the nines
in full military regalia, his entrance rivaling Richard
Gere’s in ’An Officer and a Gentleman’.

Modulation...Clarke takes the stage to Danielle's utter
delight, the two finish the song as a defiant duet.

DANIELLE / CLARKE
Don’t Cry out loud/ Just keep it
inside and learn how to hide your
feelings/ Fly High and proud, And
if you should fall remember you
almost made it / Don’t cry out
loud/ Just keep it inside and learn
how to hide your feelings/ Fly High
and proud and remember you almost
had it all!itittt

Danielle and Clarke finish with flourish. There is absolutely
no reaction from the audience.

EXT. NORMAN HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT- AFTER SCHOOL

DANIELLE
They let you out for good behavior
or something?

CLARKE
My mama came and got me. Said she
was compelled. ~

DANIELLE
It was the least I could do after I
ruined your family.

CLARKE
Thank you for that.
DANIELLE
How's it feel to be free?
CLARKE
Actually, I kinda miss that place.
DANIELLE
What?
CLARKE

In a school with no girls, I was
very popular.

DANIELLE
You fuckin’ whore!

CLARKE
Taught by the best.

DANTELLE
Clarke, nobody likes a dirty girl.

CLARKE
Yeah, right.

Clarke and Danielle get into the Mustang and pull away.

Clarke pops his tape into the stereo and presses play. A hard
rock downbeat. Debbie Harry begins to sing “Dreaming”.

The top is down. The wind blows through their hair.
In the backseat, Joan smiles.

The End.
