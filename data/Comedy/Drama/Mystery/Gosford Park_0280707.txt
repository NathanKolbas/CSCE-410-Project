Pre-Title Sequence
EXT. THE COUNTESS OF TRENTHAM’S HOUSE. DAY. NOVEMBER. 1932.

It is a grey day. Mary Maceachran, a young Scottish lady's maid,
watches a liveried chauffeur trying to start a green 1920s
Daimler in front of a London house. The chauffeur, Merriman,
climbs out with a crank handle which he fits and turns.

MERRIMAN
Just start, you filthy heap of scrap.

MARY
She’ll hear you one of these days.

MERRIMAN
I don’t care if she does.

MARY
Don’t you just?

The motor catches and he stands. While the passenger seats are
enclosed, the front, driving seat is open to the weather. Mary
places a basket with a thermos glass and a sealed, tin sandwich
container on the rear seat. As she does so, it begins to rain.

BUTLER (VO)
Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?

With a final check, she looks up to where a butler in a black
morning coat waits.

MARY
Yes, Mr Burkett.

We can hardly hear his “Everything's ready, milady,” nor can we
see the face behind the veil of the figure who hurries down the
steps. This is Constance, Countess of Trentham. Muffled in furs
against the cold, she hurries into the waiting vehicle.

The titles run over the following sequence.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.

Merriman drives. Mary sits silently next to him, huddling into
her coat. Unlike the passenger, the servants, in the roofless
front seat, are exposed to the rain.

INT. CONSTANCE’S CAR. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.

Gloved hands try lazily to open the thermos, give up immediately

and reach for the polished brass speaking tube. The veiled
indistinct mouth gives some instructions.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.

They pull over and the dripping maid gets out as a large Lagonda
stops. It is bright with shining chrome. It looks like Tomorrow
next to the Daimler’s Yesterday. A man in the front passenger
seat looks out helpfully. He speaks in a Californian accent.

WEISSMAN
Do you need any help? Are you O.K.?

The door is open now and, behind the maid, the indistinct
passenger speaks.

CONSTANCE
Am I what?

MARY
We‘re quite all right. Thank you.

IVOR
Excuse me but.. is that.. Lady Trentham?

Constance does not answer.

IVOR (CONT'D)
You don't remember me.. I’m William
McCordle‘s cousin. Ivor Novello.

At this Mary gasps in recognition but Constance merely nods.

CONSTANCE
Of course.

IVOR
May I present a friend of mine from
California, Morris Weissman? And —

Having indicated the American on the passenger side in front, he
has turned to a very handsome young man sitting behind but, on
second thoughts, he breaks off.

IVOR (CONT'D)
I was wondering if we were all headed
in the same direction...

CONSTANCE
I dare say we might be.
IVOR
Well.. if you’re sure you don’t need

any help..

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Mary has opened the folding table for the refreshments. The
other car drives away.

MARY
Was that really Ivor Novello?

CONSTANCE
Could we get on before I freeze to
death?

The maid shuts the car door, climbs in and the journey
continues. The credits end.

EXT, GOSFORD PARK. DAY.

The great house stands confidently in its park, proclaiming its
social pre-eminence. As the car continues down the drive, it
catches the attention of a beautiful woman who is cantering on
her horse, Topaz. She wears jodphurs and a loosely tied neck
scarf over her hacking jacket. This is Lady Sylvia McCordle,
daughter of an earl and doyenne of Gosford. She digs in her
heels and heads for the house.

As she arrives at the front steps, the Novello car is moving
away to the side and Novello himself, with his companion, is
being shepherded inside by the butler, Jennings. A footman
(Arthur) holds an umbrella. With them is the owner of all he
surveys, Sir William McCordle, bart, a rich parvenu and proud of
it. In his arms he holds a wiry unattractive terrier The arrival
of Constance makes him turn back.

WILLIAM
Constance, Welcome.

The visitor nods as Sylvia jumps down from her horse, tossing
the reins back over its head. She gives her aunt a kiss.

CONSTANCE
If he has to call me by my christian
name, why can’t he make it “Aunt
Constance”? I’m not the upstairs maid.

SYLVIA
You know what he's like.

CONSTANCE
I see he's still got that vile dog.

SYLVIA
It's so typical. The ones you hate
live forever. Have you had a horrid
journey?

{CONTINUED}
CONTINUED :

CONSTANCE
Fairly horrid.

SYLVIA
You must be frozen. Come and have some
tea,

Mary eyes the standing horse warily. With a snort, it shakes its
head and, rather gingerly, she stretches out her hand to take
the reins under the animal’s chin. At once it starts to fidget
and plunge. Sylvia looks across.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
Leave him alone. He knows what to do.

The embarrassed maid drops the reins as a groom appears and
leads the docile horse away. Mary, of course, does not know what
to do.

Sylvia and her aunt start up the steps but we do not follow as
they move off camera.

Jennings steps forward.

JENNINGS
Take the car round the back to unload
it.

The car starts up and heads towards the side of the house.
Still, Mary waits. Jennings looks over to the maid as he also
starts to reclimb the front steps

JENNINGS (CONT'D)
You'd better follow him. Mrs Wilson‘11
look after you.

A lone figure, she trudges off through the puddles, clutching
the dressing case, as the car carrying the Stockbridge party
sweeps up to the front.

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. DAY.

Chaos reigns. Servants duck past the piled up trunks and cases.
Valets and maids (Barnes and Sarah, joined later by Renee and
Robert) struggle to check that none of their luggage has gone to
the wrong rooms. Surveying it all, clipboard in hand, is Mrs
Wilson, the house-keeper, an opaque woman in her middle years.
Barnes, who is carrying a large flat, crested case approaches.
She does not look up.

(CONTINUED )
CONTINUED:

MRS WILSON
Just leave everything in one pile,
make sure it’s properly labelled and
it'll be taken up.

BARNES
These are the guns. Where’s the gun
room?

His voice could scarcely be more disdainful. She nods at a side
corridor.

MRS WILSON
At the end on the left. You’1l find
the keeper, Mr Strutt, in there. He’ll
show you what to do.

BARNES
I know what to do.

He goes as Mary arrives timidly, sheltering behind a laden
Merriman .

MRS WILSON
Yes?

MARY
Hello.

MERRIMAN

The Countess of Trentham.

Merriman has carried in the three smart cases. He knows the
ropes. Mrs Wilson nods and checks her list, handing a label to
the man.

MRS WILSON
Leave them over there by the luggage
lift and tie this to the top one.
You’ll find the chauffeur, Mr Raikes,
in the courtyard. He’1ll tell you where
to put the car. You’1l sleep in the
stable block with the grooms.

He sets about the task, leaving Mary feeling more alone than
ever.

MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
Her ladyship is in the Blue Damask
Room. You'll be sharing with the Head
Parlourmaid.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)
MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
She'll show you where everything is.
Elsie, this is Miss Trentham.

A young, uniformed maid, Elsie, turns at the sound of her name
and comes near

MARY
Excuse me, m’m, but.. my name’s
Maceachran..

ELSIE
Not here it's not.

Mrs Wilson has moved away as Elsie takes Mary's case.

MARY
What about the jewels?

She indicates the dressing case still in her hand.

ELSIE
This way. George is in charge of the
safe. He’s the First Footman. And you
want to watch where he puts his hands...

They turn another corner in the maze of service corridors that
xun beneath the house. At the door of the Butler's Silver
Pantry, stands a supercilious figure in livery. Next to him,
just inside the room, is a large wall safe. The iron door is
open revealing a felt-lined closet, filled with laden shelves.
George, the first footman, is receiving a case from another maid
(Renee). Mary takes a key on a chain around her neck under her
dress and opens the case, removing the jewel box which she is
about to hand over

ELSIE (CONT'D)
Have you got the ones for tonight?

MARY
Oh...

Mary unlocks the box. Inside are gleaming trays, each one with a
complete parure of gems. She takes out a set of sapphires and
puts them in the pocket of her coat.

ELSIE
Always take a separate box with the
first night’s jewels. Saves bother.

Mary nods, re~locking the box and handing it over to George who
gives her a wink as he takes it. As they walk away, re-crossing
the back hall, they almost collide with a tall stranger carrying
a suitcase. Mrs Wilson arrives.

(CONTINUED }
CONTINUED: (3)

MRS WILSON
Elsie, this is Lord Stockbridge’s
valet. Show him the footmen's
staircase, will you? And he’1l need
the ironing room.

She starts to leave. The new arrival turns to the two maids

ROBERT
The name’s Robert, Robert Parks.

This seems to halt the retreating Mrs Wilson. Robert looks at
her enquiringly.

MRS WILSON
I meant to say you'll be sharing with
Mr Weissman's man. You could have gone
up together but I don't know where
he's got to.

Other business claims her. Elsie sighs. They might as well get
on with it.

ELSIE
Has his lordship’s luggage gone up?

ROBERT
Supposedly. He's in the Tapestry Room
wherever that is.. Oh well, here, we go
again.

But Mary cannot return his casual pleasantry. Instead she half
whispers.

MARY
That‘s just it. I’ve never done a
house-party before. Not properly.

ROBERT
You'll be all right.

Elsie, above them on the back stair, has overheard.

ELSIE
How d’you manage to be taken on as a
countess’s lady’s maid if you didn’t
‘ave no experience?

MARY

She wants to train me. She said she
didn’t care about experience.

{CONTINUED }
CONTINUED: (4)

ELSIE
She didn’t want to pay for it, you
mean.

INT. KITCHEN. DAY.

A handsome face displays the brilliant smile of Henry Denton,
Morris Weissman's valet. At the long table, the cook, Mrs Croft,
is working on a tray of quail. The senior kitchen maid, Bertha,
slices carrots and the junior, Ellen, slowly turns an ice-cream
churn. They ogle the visitor who speaks in a Scottish accent.

MRS CROFT
Get on with your work. Yes?

HENRY
I just —

But before he can say more, Mrs Wilson spies him from the
corridor and enters.

MRS WILSON
Ah, Mr Weissman, there you are.
MRS CROFT
I'm dealing with this. What is it, Mr

Weissman?
The dislike between the two women is almost tangible.

HENRY
Well, to start with my name is Denton.
Henry Denton.

MRS WILSON
You are here as valet to Mr Weissman.
That means you will be known, below
stairs, as Mr Weissman for the
duration of your stay. You'll find we
keep to the old customs, It avoids
confusion.

He would answer back but decides against it.
HENRY

It's about Mr Weissman’s diet ~

MRS WILSON AND MRS CROFT
Yes?

(CONTINUED }
CONTINUED:

HENRY
He's a vegetarian.

MRS CROFT
A what?

HENRY

A vegetarian. He doesn’t eat meat. He
eats fish but not meat.

MRS CROFT
Well, I never.

HENRY
I’m sorry if it’s inconvenient.

MRS CROFT
Well, it’s not very convenient, I must
say. Doesn’t eat meat? He’s come for a
shooting party and he doesn’t eat
meat?

HENRY
Mr Weissman doesn’t intend to shoot. I
think he just wants to walk out with
them. Get a bit of air.

MRS CROFT
Get a bit of air?

MRS WILSON
Thank you. We’1ll make the necessary
adjustments. Now, if you'd like to get
one of the servants to take you
upstairs... Mr Weissman is in the
Mulgrave Room and you’1ll be sharing
with Lord Stockbridge’s valet.

Henry nods his thanks and walks out of the room watched by Mrs
Croft.

MRS CROFT
He's very full of himself, I must say.
Doesn’t eat meat!

MRS WILSON
Come along, Mrs Croft. We don’t want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?
Mr Weissman is an American. They do
things differently there.

She goes, leaving Mrs Croft seething.

(CONTINUED)
10
CONTINUED: (2)

MRS CROFT
I’ll give her ‘unsophisticated’!

Her assistants giggle but their response does not please the
cook.

MRS CROFT (CONT'D)
What are you gawping at? Those are no
good. I said ‘julienne.’ And Ellen
that is ice-cream you are churning not
concrete. Calm down.

INT. ELSIE’S ATTIC ROOM. DAY.

This is a simple, plainly furnished room with two beds. Mary
hangs up her coat then opens the valise on the bed. She
unbuttons her wet travelling dress and takes a black frock from
the case then a cap and a frilly, black apron. Elsie watches
her.

ELSIE
I thought ladies’ maids never wore
aprons.

MARY @
Her ladyship used to have a French

maid who wore a black one like this.
She thinks it’s got a bit of style.

ELSIE
I bet she does. And I'll bet she took
it out of your wages, too.

MARY
She likes to have everything just so.

Elsie rolls her eyes.

ELSIE
Don’t they all?

Behind Elsie’s bed are various pictures of movie stars,
postcards or cut from magazines. Mary goes over to the
collection to admire it. She points.

MARY
That‘s him!

This is surprising as the picture is principally of Garbo with a
man behind her,

ELSIE
Who'd you mean?

MARY
Ivor Novello. He passed us on the road
today, on his way here, and he spoke
to me. Well... he spoke to her ladyship
but I answered.

ELSIE
I only cut it out for Garbo. I prefer
the American stars. I think they've
got more oomph.

MARY
Go on. Is he really Sir William's
cousin? Imagine having a film star in
the family. Lady Sylvia must be
thrilled.

ELSIE
I don't think.

MARY
Why wouldn't she be?

ELSIE
Because she's a snobbish cow. Because
she looks down on anyone who got to
the top with brains and hard work.
dust like she looks down on her
husband. Except when it's time to foot
the bills. Then she’s got her hand out
all right.

MARY
What was her family, then?

ELSTE
What you’d expect. Toffee-nosed and
useless. Her father was the Earl of
Carton which sounds good except he
didn‘t have a pot to piss in.

MARY
What's she like to work for?

ELSIE
Horrible but he.. he’s O.K., Come on.
We’d better get cracking.

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. DAY.

Probert, Sir William's valet, is carrying a boiled-front dress
shirt past Mrs Wilson.

PROBERT
Can’t think why I’m so behind today.
The gong hasn’t gone, has it?

MRS WILSON
Oh no, you've plenty of time yet.

PROBERT
‘Cos you know what a fuss he’s in when
he’s playing Mine Host...I think I'11
go and get him a paper if there's
time...

This last is to himself as he hurries on. Mrs Wilson notices
something in the corridor that displeases her.

MRS WILSON
George? What are you up to? Hasn't Mr
Jennings given you anything to do?

GEORGE
I‘m just going to help him with the
tea. Then I'm to finish the table with
Arthur.

MRS WILSON
Well get on with it then.

With a movement suspiciously like the discarding of a cigarette,
he nods, starting up the service stair that leads to the main
house.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. DAY.

Emerging from the green baize door, George crosses a magnificent
staircase hall. As he goes, he hears a whispered, angry exchange
although he cannot detect the source.

MAN (VO)
What do you mean “no”? You promised!

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I never promised! I said I’d do my
best... Anyway, I’m going to ask him
tonight.

MAN (VO)
You'd bloody well better! What —
This is provoked by George stepping from the rug to the polished
floor. The speaker, The Hon. Freddie Nesbitt, emerges. His

anxiety dissolves at the sight of a footman.

FREDDIE
It's all right. It’s nobody.

He is joined by a young woman, Isobel McCordile.

ISOBEL
You shouldn’t sneak up on people like
that.

GEORGE

Sorry, Miss Isobel.

The camera stays with the servant as the others walk away, their
voices fading.

FREDDIE (VO)
Do you really think you’1l have a
chance to talk to him tonight?

ISOBEL (VO)
Oh, do stop going on about it.

FREDDIE (VO)
That’s all very fine but why the hell
do you think I’ve come here?

George turns the handle of the saloon door, without knocking,
and goes silentiy in.

INT. SALOON/LIBRARY. DAY.

Sitting at a table, surrounded by the evidence of a large tea,
are Constance Trentham, Morris Weissman, and Mabel Nesbitt. Ivor
is holding court, enthralling Mabel with Hollywood gossip, The
others sprawl around the room, balancing plates and cups with
magazines and cigarettes as they drawl and chatter, Jennings
presides over the teapot. George, followed by Isobel, Freddie
and the Stockbridges, enters and takes his position by the door
as Lt. Commander Anthony and Lady Lavinia Meredith approach the
tea table, He is ex-navy, she is Sylvia's sister, Their tone is
urgent and could not be overheard - except possibly by the
butler.

ANTHONY
What do you mean “leave it?”

LAVINTA
I just meant let it come up naturally.
Don't steer the conversation. It makes
you sound so desperate.

ANTHONY
Well, I am fucking desperate.

They cross the room to sit down, passing the tea-table.

Constance.

MABEL
What's Greta Garbo really like? Did
you get to know her?

IVOR
I did. As a matter of fact, she's
coming to stay with me next month.

Mabel gasps. Her shop-girl awe reassures Ivor but it irritates

CONSTANCE
Tell me, how much longer do you think
you'll go on making films?

IVOR
That depends how much longer the
public wants to see me in them.

CONSTANCE
I expect it's hard to know when it's
time to throw in the towel...What a
pity about that last one of yours.
What was it? *The Dodger"?

IVOR
"The Lodger“

CONSTANCE
It must be so disappointing...When
something just flops like that. After
all the hard work.

IVOR
Yes, I suppose it is rather
disappointing.

Sylvia arrives at the table.

WEISSMAN
You have some beautiful antiques, Lady
Sylvia. Real museum quality.

WEISSMAN (CONT'D)
I'm interested: How much would a
picture like that set you back?

SYLVIA
I hope you've all got everything you
need,

She shares the moment with Constance before walking back towards
the open library door where McCordle is sitting at a work table
covered with gun tools and a pistol feeding his terrier, Pip.
Keeping him company is Louisa Stockbridge.

LOUISA
Who's the funny little American?

WILLIAM
Morris Weissman? A friend of Ivor's.
He makes films in Hollywood. Ivor
asked if he could bring him and I
didn't see why not. I thought he might
be interested in shooting but...

LOUITSA
Never mind. He adds to the glamour of
the gathering. I didn't expect
anything half as exotic.

During this, William goes to pour two whiskies. He splashes a
little soda into them. Nearby a door set into the books opens
and Probert appears. He is surprised to find the room occupied.

PROBERT
I beg your pardon, Sir. I just thought
I'd take the Times up with me. In case
you want to read it when you dress.

WILLIAM
Good thinking, Probert.

As the valet looks for the paper, William hands the drink to
Louisa but she shakes her head.

LOUISA
Not for me. Far too early. And you
know I never drink whisky.

WILLIAM

Nonsense. Come on. Drink up. It's good
for you.

LOUISA
Really, Bill. You're such a bad
influence. Don't blame me if I pass
out at dinner.

But she takes the drink and sips it as the valet takes the paper
and leaves.

WILLIAM
I don't know how impressed your
husband is with our Showbiz folk. He
looks as if he's being forced to share
a railway sleeper with a garage

mechanic.

LOUISA
Tim afraid he only feels safe with his
own kind.

WILLIAM

Poor old Raymond.

LOUISA
Tf you think he's dull you should've
met his father. He made Raymond look
like Buster Keaton.

12 INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. EVE.

Mary carries three evening frocks while Elsie carries one. She
holds it up.

ELSIE
Mrs Nesbitt. She’s only got this one
with her. Says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

MARY
Do you always look after visitors if
they don’t have a maid?

ELSIE
Sometimes Dorothy helps. Though why
Mrs Wilson makes the Still Room Maid

annoy Mrs Croft.

Which one does Dorothy answer to?

She opens a door and goes in.

INT. IRONING AND SEWING ROOM. EVE.

In the centre are several ironing boards. Barnes, Robert, Sarah
and Renee are in there working. Robert brushes glaze on an

evening waistcoat as he irons it.

ELSIE
You found it, then?

She smiles at Robert. Then points to a cupboard.

ELSIE (CONT'D)
This one's yours.

MARY
Thanks.

ROBERT
What's your name?

MARY
E think here I’m called Trentham..

ROBERT
No. I meant your real name?

MARY
Mary. Mary Maceachran.

ROBERT
Blimey. What does her ladyship call
you?

MARY

Well, it should be Maceachran. That’s
what my mother says. Now I'ma lady’s
maid. But she can’t pronounce it so
she calls me Mary.

ROBERT
I don’t blame her.

Elsie irons with contempt.

BARNES

ELSIE

RENEE
What d’you expect from a woman without
her own maid?

SARAH
Lady Lavinia always says a woman who
travels with no maid has lost her self-
respect. She calls it “giving in.’

ELSIE
I don’t have a maid and T haven’t
“given in.”
SARAH
That's different.
ELSIE
Why?
BARNES

Yes, why is it different, Sarah?

SARAH
Miss Morse to you.

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. EVE.

Henry is carrying some clothes and a pair of stout shoes. As he
goes, he opens every door and looks inside.. He marvels at the
complexities of the still room, then at the larders and so on.
He jumps at the sound of a voice. It is Arthur, the Second

Footman.

ARTHUR
Can I help you?

HENRY
I er.. I was looking for the brushing
room. I thought I'd give Mr Weissman’s
tweeds a going-over for tomorrow.

ARTHUR
The boot room’s next door...Do you
really live in Hollywood?

HENRY
I do.

ARTHUR
But how did you get there? I mean,
where did you start from?

HENRY
Where do you think? Scotland.

This answer is not quite satisfying to Arthur. He looks at
Lewis. Then he presses on.

ARTHUR
Were you always in service? Or did you
ever think of trying to get into
films? I wanted to be an actor
once...when I was little...

HENRY

Was that a bell?
LEWIS

It’s not the dressing gong, is it?
ARTHUR

Can't be time for them to change yet,

surely.

He goes off to investigate as Henry tries different brushes to
suit the tweed.

INT. RED SALOON. EVE.

Tea is nearly finished. Jennings hands an empty tray to George.

JENNINGS
Its nearly time for the gong. If they
don't want any more, take their cups

them much.

George walks towards the sofa on the left of the fire-place.

RAYMOND
Sylvia, I mean it. There mustn't be
any nonsense.

SYLVIA
I don't know what you're talking
about.

Sylvia, without her hacking jacket but still in jodphurs, speaks
to her other brother-in-law, Raymond Stockbridge. With George on
camera, we hear them before we see them. Raymond sits reading a
magazine but it is clear that something has set him on edge.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
Have you done a lot of shooting this
year?

RAYMOND
Quite a lot

GEORGE
Are you finished, your ladyship? or
would you like some more tea?

SYLVIA
All finished, thank you, George. So is
Lord Stockbridge.

He starts to clear as she looks across at the silent peer.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
Does Louisa always go out with you?

RAYMOND
Usually.

SYLVIA
How good she is...It bores me stiff,
I'm afraid. And William's such a
rotten shot, he doesn't really like
anyone standing with him. I try and
duck out of it. Particularly if it's
Scotland.

RAYMOND
I'm very fond of Scotland..

He speaks without looking up as George takes his tray and us
over to the table.

CONSTANCE
But what a waste! If you‘re not
shooting either, then they'll only be
six! William? Isn‘t that a shame...

She addresses William who stands in the library doorway with
Louisa. Anthony makes a move to speak to him but William's words
deter him.

WILLIAM
It doesn't matter...I'm going up to
change.

CONSTANCE

Well, I am surprised. Normally
anything to do with shooting or those
wretched guns is sacrosanct. What is
your secret, I wonder?

Ivor drifts over to Sylvia.

IVOR
Zam sorry about that. I should have
made it clear. Stupid of me.

SYLVIA
Nonsense. It's William's fault. He
just has this idea that all Americans
sleep with guns under their pillows.

IVOR
So they do. But they’re more for each
other than for killing birds.
She laughs as Raymond looks up from his reading.
RAYMOND
Remind me, how are you related to
William exactly?

IVOR
Qur mothers were first cousins.

RAYMOND
Really? I don't know that I ever met
William's mother. Didn't she do
something rather original?

George crosses back to the now clear tea-table.

IVOR

She was a teacher. So was mine.
RAYMOND

Oh? Well, of course that's marvellous,

isn't it?

Back at the table, Constance is ingratiating herself with her
neighbour.

CONSTANCE
Sylvia's so clever. She always finds
such wonderful servants. I don't know
how she manages. I'm breaking in a new
maid and I'm simply worn out with it.
There's nothing more exhausting, is
there?

MABEL
I don't have a lady's maid.

She gives the information flatly but Constance remains light.
Sylvia has given up on Raymond and come to look for a cigarette
in a box on the tea-table.

CONSTANCE
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid. Honestly, for all
the help I have to give her, she
should be paying me...

SYLVIA
She does look rather young.

Constance drops her voice so that only Sylvia (and George) can
hear.

CONSTANCE
Well of course what she is, my dear,
is wonderfully cheap.

She laughs softly with her niece. During all this, George has
removed the cloth, and folded the tea-table.

SARAH
I s'pose Old Mother Trentham'1ll have
her begging bowl out while she's here.

RENEE
She won't be bothering your employer.
That's for sure.

MARY
What d‘'you mean? Why not?

ELSIB
‘Cos Lady Lavinia Meredith hasn’t a
penny to bless herself with

BARNES
And who's fault is that?

SARAH
There’s nothing wrong with the
Commander. He's just been a bit

unfortunate.
BARNES
T'll say. I think he's pathetic.
SARAH
Then why don't you hand in your
notice?
RENEE

Well, the other two sisters fell on
their feet. ‘Course, it helps that
they’re good-looking.

MARY
Lady Sylvia's lovely.

ELSIE
Doe you think so?

SARAH
She might have done a bit better for
herself, really.

ELSIE
I beg your pardon. Lord Carton was
determined to get Six William for
either of the two eldest. I was told
he could have had his pick.

BARNES

for six months a year. Come to that,
who keeps Ma Trentham in stockings
and gin? Old Money Bags, that's who.

ELSIE
I think it's disgusting. The way they
use him. Especially when they all look
down on him ‘cos he’s made it himself.
None of them have got the brains to
make the price of a packet of tea.

Have you finished, Elsie?

ELSIE
Nearly, Mrs Wilson. I’ve just got
these cuffs to do.

MRS WILSON
When you're ready make your way to the
Servants' Hall. We dine after the
guests are dressed and before we serve
dinner.

Barnes follows, saying,

BARNES
Here we go. Yes sir, no sir, three
bags full, sir.

MARY
What’s Lord Stockbridge like?

ROBERT
He thinks he's God Almighty but they
all do.

INT. DINING-ROOM. EVE.

A beautiful and complicated table-setting fills the screen with

six glasses of different shapes and sizes, and silver cutlery
ranged sideways out from a place mat supporting a folded napkin.

On the right, among the spoons and knives is a single fork while
all the other forks are on the left. A hand enters the frame and
takes it up.

HENRY (VO)
Why does this fork go on the right?

Henry is examining it. Arthur, wearing green baize gloves for
moving silver, takes it back, spits on it, rubs it lightly and
replaces it.

ARTHUR
Because they eat their fish with two
of them. One in each hand.

HENRY
Why's that then?

ARTHUR
Search me.

George enters. He carries a tray holding some full, xed wine
decanters.

GEORGE
What are you doing here?

HENRY
Just looking around.

George unloads the tray onto the sideboard then takes a ruler
out of a drawer and starts to measure the exact distance between
the place settings.

GEORGE
Mr Jennings‘ll be up in a minute. If I
were you, I‘d go and ‘look around’
somewhere else.

HENRY
Whatever you say.

With a smile, he leaves. Arthur waits until the door shuts.

ARTHUR
There's something funny about that
bloke..

GEORGE

JENNINGS
Are you finished? What about Lord
Rupert Standish and Mr Blond?

He stands in the other door. Frowning, he moves an entire place
setting slightly to the left.

GEORGE
Her ladyship said not to lay for them.
The stuff’s ready if they get here in
time. We can stick two more places on
in a jiffy.

JENNINGS
When they arrive, you'll be dressing
Mr Blond, Arthur. George, you’11 have
Lord Rupert. Tf they’re very late,
they can change by themselves. You can
tidy up when they're downstairs. Is Mr
Nesbitt settled?

GEORGE
I‘ll go up and finish him off now.

ARTHUR @
And Mr Novello?

JENNINGS

Mr Weissman’s man will attend to him.
Right. As soon as you’re done, join me
in the drawing-room for the drinks.

He goes. George folds up the ruler and puts it away.

GEORGE
What's the matter with you?

ARTHUR
Nothing.. only I thought I'd be doing
Mr Novello, that’s all.

GEORGE
And now you won’t see him in his under-
drawers? Never mind. Better luck next
time.

Arthur attempts to conceal his furious blushing.

So, how’s it going? Are you enjoying

HENRY

Very much. Are you, sir?
INT. TRENTHAM BEDROOM. EVE.

Constance, wearing the blue dress we saw Mary ironing and the
sapphires, is sitting in front of her looking glass. Mary
arranges a small tiara in her mistress’s hair.

CONSTANCE
Rather a mixed bag. That Mr Weissman’s
very odd. Apparently he's in films. He
directs something called “The Charlie
Chan Mysteries.” Or does he produce
them? I never know the difference.

MARY
Really? I enjoy those, milady.

Constance lights a cigarette. She isn’t interested in Mary’s
movie-going.

CONSTANCE
I suppose it’s fun to have a film star
staying but there’s always so little
to talk about after the first flush of
recognition. And why has Freddie
Nesbitt brought that awful, common
wife of his? Isobel only asked him
because a gun dropped out and that’s
no excuse to inflict her on us all.
And I'm told he’s been sacked from his
bank now, Thank heaven he’s a younger
son... So, what's the gossip in the
servants’ hall?

MARY
Nothing, really, milady.

But Constance knows better than that as she puffs away.

CONSTANCE
Nonsense. Out with it.

MARY
Well... is it true that Sir William
could have married Lady Stockbridge?
If he'd wanted to?

Only that Lord Carton was after Sir
William for one of them and he didn't

CONSTANCE
What would you say if I told you they
cut cards for him?

MARY
What? They didn’t, did they?

For a moment Constance relishes the shock on her maid’s face.

CONSTANCE
O£ course not. Now, tomorrow morning
I'll breakfast in bed and get straight
up into the tweeds. What shirt have
you brought?

MARY
The pink with the green check.

CONSTANCE
Oh no, dear. Quite wrong. Always
something very plain for country
sports. The one IT had on today will
do.

MARY
But it’s soiled.

CONSTANCE
Well? You can wash it, can’t you. God,
I hate shooting. Why does one have to
do these things?

MARY
Couldn’t you stay indoors? Lady Sylvia
wouldn’t mind.

CONSTANCE
Maybe not but he would. He’s terribly
touchy. Worse since they made him a
baronet. Now he thinks he’s the last
Plantagenet and takes offence
accordingly.

INT. MCCORDLE DRESSING ROOM. EVE.

Probert is putting the finishing touches to Six William's
evening dress. The new baronet looks at the reflection of
himself. His dog also checks out the final effect.

WILLIAM
And you really don’t think a
handkerchief?

PROBERT
No, sir

MeCordle reluctantly accepts his valet’s judgement. Probert (and
the camera) crosses the door at the moment it opens and Sylvia
appears, her hard beauty accentuated by the superb cut of her
clothes. When she speaks, it is difficult to mask her
indifference.

SYLVIA
I'm going down. Lewis said you wanted
me.

WILLIAM (VO)
Who’s next to me at dinner?

SYLVIA
You know who. Aunt Constance and
Lavinia.

WILLIAM

Why do I have to have the old trout
the whole bloody time? Why can't I
have Louisa?

SYLVIA
Do you really want me to explain the
Table of Precedence now? Or can it
wait?

Her voice is dripping with sarcasm.

WILLIAM (VO)
Who gives a shit about precedence?

Probert walks over to put something into a tall-boy near Sylvia

in time for us to see her shrug, speaking wearily as she would
to a tiresome child.

SYLVIA
You rage when people look down on you
and then you insist on behaving like a
vulgar ignoramus.

Her contemptuous words have their effect. This is how she
controls him.

WILLIAM (VO)
Has Constance asked you for any money
yet?

The camera has followed Probert as he continues to tidy the
dressing-room. Now he takes a crested, ivory clothes brush from
a tall-boy and returns to Sir William.

SYLVIA
No.

WILLIAM
Raymond says she’s been complaining
that her allowance isn’t big enough.
I’ve a good mind to stop it
altogether.

SYLVIA
I thought it was settled for her
lifetime,

WILLIAM
Says who?

His manner is bullying and unpleasant but Sylvia is
uninterested.

SYLVIA
Will that be all, sir?

Probert restrains a smile as he carries the clothes brush back
to the dressing-table.

WILLIAM (VO)
I wish Anthony wasn’t here. Try and
make sure he doesn’t get me on my own,
can you?

SYLVIA (VO)
Why?

WILLIAM (VO)
I’m pulling out of his scheme.

Probert brings the camera back to them and he stands, waiting to

SYLVIA

WILLIAM
No. And I’m not going to if I can help
it. Louisa thought I should do it next
week. Then he can sob in private.
Spare Lavinia’s blushes

SYLVIA
Far be it from me to contradict
Louisa.. Poor little Anthony. I thought
he was looking unusually pathetic at
tea...Get away from me.

She shoves Pip off her foot as Probert bows.

PROBERT
Will there be anything else, sir?
WILLIAM
C No, thank you, Probert.

21 INT. GALLERY. EVE.

As Probert emerges, Elsie is coming down the gallery looking
harrassed.

PROBERT
Bverything all right, girl?

ELSIE
Honestly, I don’t know how I'll
manage. She’s forgotten her hairpins.
She hasn’t packed the right shoes.. I’m
making bricks without straw, Mr
Probert. Really I am.

Mary appears, carrying the dirty shirt.
ELSIE (CONT'D)
I don’t suppose you've got any

hairpins to spare, have you?

George is emerging from the Nesbitts’ bedroom as Elsie arrives.

ELSIE
Is he done?

He nods, raising his eyebrows, and goes. She reaches for the
door handle when there is a movement at the end of the gallery.
William and his dog are both looking at her. With a secret
smile, Elsie returns his gaze before she opens the door.

INT. NESBITT BEDROOM. EVE.

Mabel is at the dressing table and, for a moment, it seems that
Freddie has his wife’s wrist in his fist. He swings round and,
if he did have hold of her, he releases it

ELSIE
I’ve got some pins, madam, From Lady
Trentham’s maid.

FREDDIE
We should be downstairs already.

MABEL
You go on. T‘ll be as quick as I can.

FREDDIE
Try and make her look respectable.

He says this to the maid and goes without a comment from either
woman. They stare at each other through the glass. Mabel with
her pasty face and lank hair looks terrible.

MABEL
Well, there’s no harm in trying.

INT. DRAWING~-ROOM, EVE

Jennings carries a salver with two martini glasses to Ivor who
is playing the grand piano. Is it ‘I Can Give You The
Starlight”? He and Weissman take the drinks.

WEISSMAN
Thank you, Mr Jennings.

JENNINGS
Just Jennings, sir

WEISSMAN
Then thank you, Jennings.

JENNINGS
I'll clear the piano for you, sir.

He lifts the photographs and albums that litter the closed lid
of the grand as Sylvia approaches. Ivor stands but she makes him
play. Behind her, the others drift in.

SYLVIA
Jennings, can I have a martini when
you've done that? Oh, don’t get up. Go
on. Please. What is it? I don’t
believe I know it.

IVOR,
Nothing.. an idea I’ve been fiddling
with.

WEISSMAN

By the way, Jennings. I’ve a telephone
call booked. For California. If you
could let me know as soon as they get
through.

JENNINGS
Very good, sir.

SYLVIA
I can't imagine how one could ever
invent a tune.. How do you start?

IVOR

It's rather hard to say exactly.
SYLVIA

Well I think it’s too clever for any

words .

She strolls back to join the others. Weissman watches her as
Jennings finally lifts the lid of the piano, filling the room
with music. He starts back to the drinks table.

WEISSMAN
How do you manage these people?

IVOR
You forget. I make my living
impersonating them. What does he want?

Across the room, Henry has come in. He lingers by the door as
Jennings approaches

JENNINGS
Can I help you?

HENRY
You know.. I really enjoy the way you
do things, Mr Jennings.

JENNINGS
I beg your pardon.

Weissman has left the piano and crossed the room.

WEISSMAN
What is it, Henry?

HENRY
Nothing. I just wanted to be sure you
have everything you need. Sir.

WETSSMAN
Yes. Thank you

Henry goes, leaving Jennings completely bewildered. Weissman
acknowledges him.

WEISSMAN (CONT'D)
It’s so good to find a servant these
days who takes an interest.

25 INT. SERVANTS’ HALL. EVE.
A table is laid for dinner with a nervous boy ready to serve.
All the indoor servants except the kitchen staff are here
including two housemaids, May and Janet. Merriman nods at Mary.
Jennings enters with George and Arthur.

DOROTHY
Everything satisfactory, Mr Jennings?

JENNINGS
Yes, thank you, Dorothy. They have
their drinks. We can take our leisure
for half an hour, I think.

At the head of the table, he looks at Renee who stands on his
right. His brow darkens.

JENNINGS (CONT'D)
What’s this?

DOROTHY
I did tell her, Mr Jennings.

RENEE
tT believe this is my place, Mr
Jennings -

JENNINGS
Qh? Since when did a baroness outrank
a countess? Or is that some foreign
custom you've picked up on your
travels?

Renee purses her lips but says nothing.
JENNINGS (CONT'D)
Miss Trentham? Would you like to come
and take the seat of honour?

But Mary does not recognise her ‘name’. He repeats it and Arthur
nudges her

MARY
t'm all right here, Mr Jennings, thank
you.

DOROTHY

Go on. Don't keep him waiting.

Jennings stands. Mary, blushing, moves to his right hand side,
displacing Renee who moves to Jennings’s left but even that does
not satisfy him,

JENNINGS
Miss Meredith, you may come to my left
if you please.

As Renee stalks down the table, Mary turns queryingly to George.
He whispers.

Her mistress married a baron so she
lost her rank as an earl’s daughter.
Renee always tries to catch Mr
Jennings out but no one can.

LEWIS
Naturally I’m nothing when there’s
visitors in the house. Never mind. I’m
used to it.

No one pays her any attention as the housekeeper, Mrs Wilson,
makes her own stately entrance and takes her place at the far
end between Robert and Probert.

MRS WILSON
Good evening, Mr Jennings.

Jennings nods, says Grace and they sit. The boy holds a plate
for Mrs Wilson and then the butler. Unlike upstairs, they pass
vegetable dishes across the table.

JENNINGS
Right. Start when you get it. No time
for loitering.

HENRY
Can I ask a question?

JENNINGS
Certainly, Mr Weissman. How can we
help?

HENRY
I just wondered. How many people here
had parents in service? And was that
why they chose to go into it?

JENNINGS
That‘s an interesting point and one I
can’t answer. All those of you whose

parents were in service raise your
hand.

Most hands go up. We hear “not both of them” or “just for a bit,
before they married,” “I s'pose they expected me to,” and so on.
Only Dorothy, Barnes and Robert are left.

Not you, Dorothy?

HENRY
What about you, Mr Stockbridge?

Robert looks up. Something in this attracts Mrs Wilson's

attention

He shrugs.

GEORGE
What’s the matter? Don’t you know?

ROBERT
Yes I know. I know what both of them
did as a matter of fact. But it didn’t
have no effect on me. On my choice.
MRS WILSON
Why is that?

ROBERT
Because I grew up in an orphanage.

This wrong foots the company. Jennings quickly pulls a veil over
matters.

JENNINGS
Thank you, Mr Weissman. For giving us
something to think about... I must
compliment Bertha on this stew. And
Mrs Croft on the choice of the beef,
of course. It’s delicious.

Mary now has George on her other side. She whispers to him.

GEORGE
Always eats with her own staff.

JENNINGS
Something amusing, Miss Trentham? Can
we share it?

Mary is saved by the arrival of Lady Sylvia McCordle. In her

couture clothes and jewels,

fairy kingdom. The company jumps up.

SYLVIA
IT am so sorry to disturb you all but a
major crisis has arisen. I’ve just
learned that Mr Weissman doesn’t eat
meat. Is it a Jewish thing? I always
thought that was pork and prawns...But
the point is: What are we to do? I
can’t tell Mrs Croft. I simply don’t
dare.

MRS WILSON
Everything’s under control, your
ladyship. Mr Weissman’s valet informed
me as soon as they arrived. We’ve
prepared a special version of the
soup, he can eat the hors d’oevres and
the fish and we'll do Welsh Rabbit for
the game course. I’m not sure about
the entree but we'll think of
something.

Sylvia's response is not as warm as it might be.

SYLVIA
Thank you, Mrs Wilson. Of course
you're ten steps ahead. Which one of
you is Mr Weissman’s valet?

You're all set, then.

A few junior servants giggle which does not amuse Mr Jennings
one bit.

JENNINGS
Yes, George?

GEORGE
Nothing, Mr Jennings.

They transfer their attention to their plates.
EXT. KITCHEN COURT. NIGHT.

Mary, carrying a cup of tea, is walking across the courtyard
towards the garages for the visitors' cars. We can see Merriman
there working on Constance's car. There is a sound from the
shadows. Bertha is sitting by herself, smoking.

MARY
You gave me a turn. I didn't see you
there. Aren't you cold?

BERTHA
It feels good to be cold after a day
in that kitchen.

Mary walks on until Merriman comes towards her.

MARY
I thought you could do with this.

MERRIMAN
That's kind, love. How are you getting

Before Mary can answer, they are interrupted by the arrival of
an open roadster which sweeps in, all headlights and bright

man to carry them. I thought it made
more sense to bring them to the back

He leans down to feed Pip who sits beneath his chair.

CONSTANCE
You'll make that dog sick.

Weissman is talking to Louisa.

WEISSMAN
Of course I'm going out with them.
Ivor's promised to look after me.

LOUISA
Ivor's going with you?

WEISSMAN
Certainly. He says he's looking
forward to a good walk.

LOUISA
Is he? Doesn't sound very like Ivor
He normally stays in bed and comes out
with the ladies for luncheon.

WEISSMAN
Well, he wants to show me how it all
works.

Before she can respond to this, a dish is brought by Arthur to
Weissman’s left side.

On her right, Raymond eats in silence. There is a crack of
thunder as she turns to him

SYLVIA
Ivor and Mabel are talking in the
wrong direction so you’d better join
us. It never seems to work when I’m
mot at the end.. What a filthy night
it's turning into. I’m afraid you'll
all be drenched tomorrow but of course
you'll say it doesn’t matter.

RAYMOND
It doesn’t.

Beyond him, Isobel is listening to Anthony on her other side.

ANTHONY
What do you mean he’s losing interest
in that sort of thing?

ISOBEL
Not just that. The whole Empire. He
thinks the steam’s gone out of it.

Anxiously Anthony talks down the table, making the conversation

general.

ANTHONY
That’s not true is it, William? That
you think the Empire’s finished?

FREDDIE
Surely everyone feels the war changed
things. Don’t they?

LAVINIA

for Raymond. At least the family had
one representative in the front line

Mabel turns to Ivor on her right, speaking sotto voce.

MABEL
What about Commander Meredith? He must
have done something right.

TVOR
Not much. After ten years in the navy
you're made Lieutenant Commander if
you're not dead or in prison. No,
Stockbridge was the here. Once he
captured an entire battalion single-
handed. He wal
ked into the middle of them by
accident and instead of panicking he
told them he was the advance guard
whereupon they all flung down their
rifles on the spot. Trouble was there
were three thousand of them and only
one of him.

MABEL
But how splendid!

SYLVIA
It was splendid. How many times were
you mentioned in despatches, Raymond?

RAYMOND
I forget.

Throughout this, George and Arthur move round the table.
Jennings stands surveying his troops. He moves forward from time
to time to replenish an empty (red) wine glass. He is at the
table when he sees Elsie. Crossing over to her, he is almost

fierce.

SYLVIA
No, they're too late. Give them a tray
in the billiard room. They can join us
later.

JENNINGS
Very good, milady.

Isobel has heard. She leans over eagerly, her plain face flushed
with pleasure.

ISOBEL
Is Rupert here? Shall I go and say

hello? e@

SYLVIA
I don’t think so.. Thank you, Jennings.

As Jennings walks away, we can just hear one final interchange.

MABEL

But I’m not a country girl at all.
IVOR

Oh?
MABEL

No. I grew up in Leicester. My father
had a glove factory. One thing I do
know is how a glove should fit.

FREDDIE
Really, darling! You’re boring poor Mr
Novello to death!

Off camera, Ivor protests “Not at all” as Jennings reaches the
door.

INT. BILLIARD-ROOM. NIGHT

Arthur is carrying a tray and he moves discreetly as the two
young men play billiards in a pool of light from the overhead
fitting. They pay the footman no attention.

JEREMY
Face it. You're a younger son. With
the tastes of a marquess and the
income of a vicar. Here's the
solution. She likes you. Her mother
likes you. She’s not exactly a show-
stopper but you can’t have everything.

RUPERT
Why’s it so important to you?

JEREMY
Because if you marry badly, who's
going to give me decent shooting in my
old age?

RUPERT
The father’s not keen on the idea.

JEREMY
He’ll come round. ‘Have you met my
daughter, Lady Rupert Standish?’

RUPERT
Maybe... He thinks I’m after her money.

JEREMY
Of course he does but you can’t let
that put you off... “Faint heart never
won fair lady.” Or, in this case, rich

lady.

RUPERT
He’s more of an obstacle than you
think.

JEREMY
Then you must overcome it, mustn’t
you?

During this, Arthur quietly unloads plates from a tray onto a
bridge table laid with a cloth, silver and glass. He strikes a
match to light the candles in its centre. The noise and flash of
flame alert the young men to his presence and they straighten
up.

Her ladyship asks if you would join
her in the drawing-room after you've
finished.

RUPERT
Certainly.

ARTHUR
Tf you'd ring when you're ready for
your next course...

He indicates a bell pull in the dado.

JEREMY
We will. Thank you.

Arthur goes. As he leaves Rupert speaks softly.

RUPERT
Do you think he heard?

INT. DINING-ROOM. NIGHT.

The men are standing as the women leave. Jennings is the only
servant present.

SYLVIA
Now, don’t be too long.

William shuts the door and returns to his seat, inviting the
other men to join him.

WILLIAM
Move up, all of you.. Thank you,
Jennings.

They sit at his end of the table, irrespective of where they
were before.

WEISSMAN
I don't suppose there's any sign of my
telephone call?

JENNINGS
Not yet, I’m afraid, sir. The lines
can be very busy...

Jennings places a decanter of port in front of William, removing
its stopper.

JENNINGS (CONT'D}
Would you like me to ask Lord Rupert
and Mr Blond to join you, sir?

WILLIAM
Leave them be. They can entertain the
ladies. Give Mr Novello a rest.

FREDDIE
Is that Rupert Standish? Has he
arrived?

ANTHONY

Why? Do you know him?

FREDDIE
Certainly. We younger sons have to
stick together. We’ve a lot in common.

He imagines this will amuse William but, instead, his host looks
at him with disdain as he pours himself a glass and passes the
port to his left. Jennings brings the cigars.

WILLTAM
Yes. I expect you have.

The butler leaves and we go with him.

INT. SCULLERY. NIGHT.

Among the bottles in this ancillary room, there are two with the

skull and

cross bones sign of poison. Bertha checks the contents

of a drawer. Mrs Croft is watching her.

BERTHA
Arthur said he had to shout it down
the table. Makes you feel sorry for
him.

MRS CROFT
He's got nothing to be ashamed of.
It’s not his fault if they put him in
an orphanage.

BERTHA
It's nobody's fault if it comes to
that.

MRS CROFT

How do you know?

BERTHA
No. It’s not here. And Mr Jennings is

MRS CROFT
So he says.

BERTHA
But if it’s a silver carving knife, he
must have it. It's just gone in the
wrong drawer in the silver pantry. It
wouldn't have been put in here.

MRS CROFT
That's what I told him. How old would
you say he was?

For a moment Bertha is puzzled then she remembers what they were
talking about.

BERTHA
What do you think? Thirty one or two?
Why?

MRS CROFT

No reason.. I think T/11 turn in. We've
got an early start.

INT. WEISSMAN BEDROOM. NIGHT.

Weissman, in his dressing-gown, reads a book by the fire in this
sumptuous room.

WEISSMAN
Of course he won’t mind. I’1ll just say
Iowant you with me.. By the way, I
talked to Sheehan at the studio. The
figures are worse than they thought.
Not a single winner in the year. He
sounded pretty desperate.

He looks at the valet.

WEISSMAN (CONT'D)
Will you come back later?

HENRY
I don’t think I should risk it, do
you?

There is something smug in the way he says this. He goes to the

chair. They exchange a

look. Silently, Henry picks them up and leaves.
INT. SYLVIA‘S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

Lewis helps Sylvia into a silk peignoir. The four-poster bed has
een turned down. An embroidered, gauze blanket-cover has
replaced the counterpane.

LEWIS
Pleasant evening, milady?

SYLVIA
Not really... I‘m worn out.

She throws herself back among the pillows, Lewis strains to hang
the frock. She is old and the effort is great. But if there is
irony in their situation, neither is aware of it.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
Is there any chocolate left in that
pot?

Lewis pauses to lift the lid of an exquisite little Sévres pot
on the dressing table.

LEWIS
I’ll go down and make some more.

INT. GALLERY. NIGHT.
Lewis vanishes through the door to the back staircase as Henry
Denton enters the gallery. He is passing Sylvia’s door when ait
suddenly flies open.

SYLVIA

The suddenness of her apparition startles him for a moment. He
returns Sylvia's gaze.

HENRY
Would that be hot milk? Or cold?
SYLVIA
What do you think?
HENRY
I couldn't say, milady.
SYLVIA
Hot, then... and with something to

make it sweet...or I know I'll never
shut my eyes.

HENRY
Why? Do you have trouble sleeping,
milady?

SYLVIA

Well, I've a feeling I will tonight. In
fact, I know I'1li be wide awake at one
and bored to sobs...

HENRY
Then we must try to think of something
to amuse you -

As Barnes appears through a door further down, they break off,
their contract made. Sylvia closes her door as Henry hears
Anthony's voice.

ANTHONY (VO)
I knew it. I knew he had something
like this planned ~

Barnes rolls his eyes in Henry’s direction as they push through
onto the back stair.

INT. FOOTMEN’S ATTIC CORRIDOR. NIGHT.
Mary is climbing the stairs. At the top, she stops. She is

clearly lost. After a moment, she goes to one of the doors and
knocks. There is an invitation to ‘come in.’

INT. ROBERT'S ATTIC ROOM. NIGHT.

Henry is in his shirtsleeves. He looks up as Mary enters. She
stands, dumbstruck.

MARY
Oh... I’m ever so sorry.. I must have
taken the wrong stairs..

But Henry is too quick for her. He pushes the door shut behind
her.

HENRY
Don’t want to be seen up here or
you'll be for it

MARY
I'd better go down...

HENRY
There’s no rush, is there? Since
you’re here now..

She is frozen, receiving his advances like a gazelle cornered by
a tiger.

HENRY (CONT'D)
What about a drink? I think we’ve both
earned one.

Out of his bag on the bed, he takes a bottle of whisky and
sloshes some into two toothmugs on the wash stand. Holding out
the glass with one hand, he slips the other round her waist,
pulls her to him and leans to kiss her when, she is suddenly
transformed into a vicious, spitting, fighting cat. As he backs
away, stunned, they hear the noise of someone on the stairs.
Quick as a flash, Mary pulls herself together. When the door
opens and Robert enters, there is no trace left of the rumpus.
Naturally, he is amazed to see her.

ROBERT
What's this? Why are you in here?

MARY
I came up the wrong staircase.1I was
just waiting ‘til the coast was clear.

ROBERT

Well, you'd better get down again.
Before anyone catches you.

Holding open the door, he checks the corridor and nods. She
goes. He shuts the door.

ROBERT (CONT'D)
Tt think she's nice, that one.

HENRY
Then you'd better go after her. You
know what they say. He who hesitates
is lost.

This is not Robert's style at all but, if anything, he is amused
by his companion's brashness. Henry scoops up the fallen mug and
smoothly pours two more drinks.

HENRY (CONT'D)
So what do you make of the place?

Robert shrugs. He sips the drink and sits, watching Henry hang
his things.

HENRY (CONT'D)
I mean, is this a well run house,
would you say? Do you think Sir
William would be good to work for? e

ROBERT
No.

He does not elaborate. After a moment, Henry continues.

HENRY
How long have you been doing this?

ROBERT
What? Valeting? About seven years. I
was a footman before that.

HENRY
And working for Lord Stockbridge. Is
that a promotion?

ROBERT
No. I used to be with the Rarl of
Flintshire

HENRY
Then why did you move?

ROBERT

Henry nods. Beside Robert's bed there is a framed but old
photograph of a woman.

HENRY
Who‘s that?

ROBERT
My mum.

HENRY

Where’s she live?

ROBERT
She doesn’t. That's why they put me in
the orphanage.

HENRY
Of course. I’m sorry.. What happened to
her?

ROBERT

What d’you mean?

HENRY
Well... why did she die. I mean, was she
young? Was it in childbirth?

ROBERT
You're not very curious, are you? Yes,
she was young. She worked in a
factory, she had me and a little while
later she died. End of story.

HENRY
So why didn’t you say she was a
factory worker at dinner?

ROBERT
‘Cos I didn’t fancy discussing my
private life with a table of
strangers.

He picks up a book. Bven Henry is aware that he has overstepped
the mark.

HENRY
I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn,
mate. Didn’t mean to offend you.

ROBERT

I’m not offended. And don’t call me
‘mate.’

Henry has put his jacket and tie back on again. He looks down at
Robert. Clearly he is not going to get any more out of him.

HENRY
Well. See you later. I've got a date
with a glass of milk.

He slips out of the room.
INT. ELSIE’S ATTIC ROOM. NIGHT.

Elsie pulls off her cap and shoes and slips out of her dress.
Mary is finishing unpacking. She is still a little shaken. Elsie
flops onto the bed.

ELSIE
Shouldn’t worry about it. Goes with
the territory... I’m bushed. I think Mrs
Wilson forgets I do Miss Isobel on top
of everything else.

She is flicking through a Hollywood fan magazine. “Watch Your
Step, Ann Dvorak!” or “Joan Crawford and Douglas Faixbanks: O£
Course It’s For Keeps!” Until...

ELSIE (CONT'D)
Ooh, look.

There is a still of Ivor Novello with Benita Hume. Mary looks
over her shoulder.

MARY
dust think of him sleeping downstairs...

ELSIE
I shall have to watch you, my girl. I
can see that.

MARY
Her ladyship says that Mr Weissman’s a
Hollywood producer. He makes the
Charlie Chan films.

ELSIE
I like those. I enjoy a bit of a
fright in the cinema.

MARY

You could go with his valet. He'd give
you a fright.

MARY (CONT'D)
You'd better keep your eye on him. I

Scotland for a start. At least not
from any part of it that I know.

Elsie shrugs and goes back to her magazine.

MARY (CONT'D)
What's Mrs Nesbitt like?

ELSIE
She’s 0.K. I feel a bit sorry for her,
really.. ‘Course it never works.

MARY
What never works?

ELSIE
When a man like that marries beneath
him. He hasn’t got the brains to carry
it off.
C MARY
ZI think it’s romantic. To marry for
love.

Mary picks up Elsie’s dress and cap. Elsie is more interested in
her magazine.

ELSIE
Oh, it wasn’t love. Not him, He’s a
nasty piece of work. The ‘honourable’
Freddie Nesbitt. That’s a laugh. It
was her father’s money he was after
but there was less than he thought.
Now it’s spent and all he’s got to
show is a wife he’s ashamed of. And
he’s lost his job. He wants Miss
Isobel to put in a word with Sir
William.

MARY
Will she?

ELSIE
She might.

MARY
Ned Why should she?

Mary has been distracted by the sight of a crumpled shirt on the

chest.

ELSIE

Do you want me to come with you?
MARY

No, no. You stay there. I’1l be all

Shyly, Bertha emerges from the shadows, smoothing down her
skirts.

She's not giving anything away. Mary nods and moves off but as
she is about to leave the room, she looks back into the dark
corner where a shaft of moonlight illuminates black shoes,
crumpled trousers and underpants revealing the hairy lower
calves of a man. The rest of him is in shadow. He is quite
still. Without a word, she hurries out.

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR, NIGHT.

Mary is walking down the corridor when Mrs Wilson emerges.

MRS WILSON
Miss Trentham? Can I help you?
MARY
i was just washing a shirt of her
ladyship's.
MRS WILSON

I hope you found everything you
needed. Lady Trentham’s tea will be
laid out in the still-room any time
after seven tomorrow. We‘ve remembered
the cucumbers. Her breakfast tray may
be collected at a quarter to nine.

MARY
She likes it at half past eight.

MRS WILSON

I know but the shooting breakfast can
delay the trays a little. It won’t be
later. They move off at nine. Does she
have to have marmalade? Dorothy made
too little last January so we’ve run
out of our own.. She wouldn't care for
strawberry jam, I suppose?

MARY
Not really..

MRS WILSON
Very well. It isn’t a problem.

There is a noise. Sir William McCordle is approaching down the
corridor.

A fire crackles merrily in the grate. Constance is sitting up in
bed. She smooths the sheet before her, eagerly anticipating the
tray that Mary is carrying in from the door.

CONSTANCE
They always send up a good breakfast

not at all mean in that way...

Mary places the pretty tray across her mistress. Constance lifts
the lid of a china jam pot and wrinkles her nose.

CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
Bought marmalade! Dear me. I call that
very feeble.. Oh well. I suppose one
can’t have everything. Mary, I don’t

Strutt is with the loaders. It is drizzling slightly.

STRUTT
We're only six guns now and, apart
from Sir William, they’re shooting
doubles or singles so we won't need
you all. D’you want to toss for it?

DERWENT
What happened?

STRUTT
The American gentleman. He’s a
vegetarian. And vegetarians don’t
shoot, apparently.

CROSBIE

They all start to laugh, including Strutt, but then he quietens
them down.

George and Arthur. Probert is polishing a fob watch and a couple
of the maids, including Mary, look on.

BARNES

HENRY
Mr Weissman wants me to accompany him.
Nothing wrong in that.

ARTHUR
But what for? You're not even loading.
He hasn’t got a gun.

HENRY
Well... he might need something. @

GEORGE
What could he need?

George is imitating Henry's voice insultingly. Probert comes to
Henry’s aid.

PROBERT
Of course the very idea of service is
offensive to you, George, but there’s
no need to take it out on the rest of
us. Please forgive our ill manners, Mr
Weissman

Henry smiles a trifle nervously as he heads for the door.

STRUTT
Haven’t a clue. Right. Baker, you take
Lord Stockbridge. You won't have to
teach him much. Derwent and Crosbie,
Sir William as usual. Tozer, Mr
Nesbitt there...

Once instructed, the men break away from the group and approach
the gun they have been allotted to. William has three guns
shared between his two loaders. Stockbridge, Standish and
Meredith all have a pair. Nesbitt and Blond have one each.
William holds out a slotted pouch containing flat, ivory spills.
One by one, the guns choose a spill and read a number although
William keeps his finger fixed on one. At the end, he pulls ait
out before gathering the others

€ WILLIAM

Evens go up two, odds down two. No
ground game. Any white pheasants will

WEISSMAN
I’ll come and cheer you on.

But this suggestion does not seem to find favour. As Weissman
settles himself into the wagonette, Raymond, next to him, speaks

softly.
RAYMOND
He won’t let you. He can’t stand
witnesses.
WEISSMAN
But I keep hearing how he’s such an

ISOBEL
He won’t do it.

ISOBEL,
I don’t know, Something to do with why
Freddie was sacked but I can’t get a
straight answer out of either of them.

EXT. AN OPEN DRIVE. DAY.

The drive is about to begin. A horn blows. McCordle is ready,
gun in hand. Behind him stand his loaders, Derwent and Crosbie,
each holding a gun. The first flush of birds fly over. Sir
William lifts his gun and fires both barrels, one after the
other.

WILLIAM
Damn!

He swiftly changes guns with Derwent who reloads as Sir William
fires again.

CROSBIE

With Constance’s foot on her lap, Mary removes the broken one

Mary. And hurry.

George lifts two covered jugs from a bucket of ice on the floor
of the wagon and starts toward the temple. He passes MecCordle

STRUTT
Well, they didn’t, sir. It was a heavy
drive, the loaders were busy and

we hear only what the footman hears.

RAYMOND

What? What exactly are you warning me
of?

She falls silent as she sees the footman. At the top of the
stair, George enters the temple. Jennings hurries in behind him
and starts to unload the stew from the baskets. Henry Denton
watches as George arranges glasses on a tray.

HENRY
Can I do anything to help, Mr
Jennings?

Jennings is threatened with the spectre of bad management. After
a second, he nods.

JENNINGS
Well, since you're here.. you might
take the sherry round..

Henry lifts a tray with a decanter and glasses. As he and George
start for the terrace, they pass the Merediths who appear to be
arguing out of sight of the other guests.

LAVINIA
Just calm down.

ANTHONY
You don't seem to understand how
serious this is.

LAVINIA
We'll manage, we always have.

ANTHONY
Oh yes. And how long do you think
we'll go on managing if he sticks to

it. I don't see why you can't get your

sisters to help.

LAVINIA
Darling, I've tried. Of course I've

tried. But you know what they're like.

ANTHONY
I know they couldn't care less if we
go under. Why should they? Their
dressmakers will still be busy and
their dinners served on time.

LAVINIA
What does that matter? Why can't you
see that we've got what they'll never
have. And they know it. Do you
honestly think I'd change places with
either of them?

ANTHONY
That's not the point.

LAVINIA
Isn't it? Anyway, promise me you'll
leave it for now. This is not the
right moment.

ANTHONY
There is no sodding right moment!

Anthony moves outside. McCordle is talking to Jeremy and Rupert.
Anthony waits for him as George and Henry start to hand round

the drinks. We follow them and hear snatches of what is being

said. All

these exchanges overlap each other.

FREDDIE
That’s your problem.

ISOBEL
But I don’t see what more I can do.

In the background, Sylvia is winding a gramophone. She lifts the
needle and it starts to play “The Land Of Might Have Been.” A
few clap as Ivor bows to his hostess.

IVOR
Very tactful.

SYLVIA
I thought so. I borrowed it off Lewis.

CONSTANCE
Isn't this fun? There’s nothing like a
day out with the guns, is there?

SYLVIA
Nothing. Shall we go in? It's going to
pelt in a minute.

Ivor moves over to Weissman taking a telegram out of his pocket.

IVOR
I nearly forgot. This came for you.
About an hour ago.

Henry joins them as Weissman reads it.

HENRY
Good or bad?

WEISSMAN
Neither. Winfield Sheehan wants to
talk to me. I’11 call him later.

He explains to Ivor.

WEISSMAN (CONT'D)
The Head of Production at Fox. He's
handling the next Charlie Chan.

tsobel has left Freddie and joins Rupert, passing Jeremy and
Raymond on the way

JEREMY
You had a fantastic one in the third
drive. It was a mile high.

RAYMOND
That’s generous but I don’t think so.

RUPERT
Would you like to come and see how we
manage it at Stanton?

This is to Isobel who smiles. Then she sees as Jeremy winks at
Rupert. Behind, McCordle crosses. Anthony pounces.

ANTHONY
William!

He tries what he imagines is a casual chuckle.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
You weren’t serious last night, were
you?

WILLIAM
I’m afraid so. I was going to tell you
next week but since you asked

William is irritated. This is exactly what he wanted to avoid.
He looks about for help and seeing George, he holds up his glass
for some more.

ANTHONY
The thing is.. I don’t think you’ve
grasped what this would do to the
whole project. What it would do to me.

WILLIAM
Come on. It’s not as black as all
that.

ANTHONY

Yes, it bloody well is.

WILLIAM
Well, I’m sorry to hear it, Anthony.
But business is business. I‘m not a
Charity Commissioner, you know.

ANTHONY
For Christ's sake, William, I’m
begging you —

Impulsively, he siezes the other man’s forearm forgetting about
the full glass of Bloody Mary. It shatters on the paving.
Anthony is horrified. He takes out a handkerchief, offering it
to McCordle.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
I’m so sorry, old man.

His anger is obvious but contained as George stoops to pick up
the pieces and Jennings comes into the doorway. He is just in
time. The rain is starting again.

JENNINGS
Luncheon is served.

The company hurries in to the gorgeous table where the servants
wait for them.

CONSTANCE
I love a picnic, don’t you?

INT. MAIDS’ ATTIC CORRIDOR. DAY.

Elsie, in a dressing-gown and carrying a sponge bag, opens a
door at the end of the corridor. We hear a squawk and a splash.

INT. SERVANTS’ ATTIC BATHROOM. DAY.

The room is small and spartan without decoration of any sort
Mary, embarrassed and covering herself, has been surprised in
the bath.

MARY
Shut the door for heaven’s sake.

ELSIE
It's only Lewis. If any of the men
were found up here they’d be sacked on
the spot. Worse luck.

She settles herself on the mean, cork-covered stool. Mary
finishes her washing, uneasily concealed behind her arm and her
flannel. Elsie watches her, amused

ELSIE (CONT'D)
Don’t tell me you’re a convent girl.
Or is it Presbyterian modesty? Is the
water hot?

MARY
Not very.

ELSIE

No. And it won't be ‘til the guns come
home. I'd better get into yours.

Her Ladyship says Sir William loves

ELSIE
Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door
but he does love it. Sweet, really

MARY
Last night - no, I shouldn't say.

ELSIE
Yes, you should. What is it?

MARY
Only that...when I went down to wash
that shirt, I think he was in the
ironing-room. With one of the kitchen
maids.

ELSIE
No. It wouldn't have been him.

She is surprisingly definite.

MARY
I think it was. Leastways, he came
down the passage a moment later and I
don't see how -

BLSIE
No, it wasn't him. Hurry up.

She starts to undress.

INT. SERVANTS ATTIC BATHROOM. DAY

Now Mary is putting on her dressing-gown and drying her hair
while Elsie ig in the bath. She is more comfortable to bathe
with a witness than Mary was. They have settled into a gossip.

MARY
You know when you said Sir William
could have had his pick? Between Lady
Sylvia and Lady Stockbridge?

ELSIE
Yes.

MARY

and she said...they cut cards for him.

She shares the wicked thought with Elsie.

ELSIE
No!

MARY

I can't believe it either. I s'pose it
was a joke.

ELSIE
I wouldn't be too sure. I heard...

She breaks off with a sigh, catching herself out.

ELSIE (CONT'D)
Just listen to me.

MARY
What?

ELSIE
Why do we spend our time living
through them...? Look at poor old
Lewis. If her own mother had a heart
attack, she'd think it was less
important than one of Lady Sylvia's
farts. He always says -

She remembers herself and breaks off.

MARY
Who? Who says what?

ELSIE
Never mind. Doesn't matter...I
dunno...all I want is to be at the
centre of my own life. ‘Course if you
say that in this house, Mr Jennings
thinks you're planning to blow up the
Romanovs .

There is a bang on the door. From outside we hear an anguished
voice.

LEWIS
Are you ever coming cut?

INT. TRENTHAM BEDROOM. EVE.

Mary is fastening Constance into another of the dresses that we
saw being hung up earlier with another of the sets of jewels.
The mistress is in a jolly mood.

CONSTANCE
You must know. You can’t fool me. If
there’s one thing I don’t look for in
amaid, it’s discretion. Except with
my own secrets, of course.

MARY
Well, I don’t know much, milady..
Apparently, he was counting on Sir
William for an investment and had
“guaranteed his interest” — whatever
that means.. Anyway, Mr Barnes — the
Commander’s valet — said he wanted to
leave at once but Lady Lavinia’s
persuaded him to stay until tomorrow.
To make less of a thing of it.

There is a brisk knock and Sylvia enters. She completely ignores
Mary .

SYLVIA
I’m on my way down. This is just a
quick warning. For God’s sake be
careful not to rub him up, tonight.

CONSTANCE
EZ don’t know what you mean.

SYLVIA
You know exactly what I mean. He’s in
a filthy mood. With everyone... He’s
talking about stopping your allowance.

CONSTANCE
But it’s for life! That was settled!
He can’t do that!

SYLVIA
Just you watch him. He’s absolutely
spoiling for a fight and if you'll
take my advice, you won’t give him
one... I’ve got to go.

She hurries out. This exchange has been in and out of vision as

we follow Mary putting things away. Constance catches her eye
through the mirror.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. EVE

Jennings, with whisky, glasses etc., crosses the hall. Weissman
is on the telephone.

WEISSMAN
What am I going to do about it? I‘m
going to call his Goddamn bluff. I‘l1l
meet his fucking deadline. That’s what
I’m going to do about it!

We just see Sylvia and Louisa respond to his language as
Jennings gets to the library.

INT, LIBRARY. EVE.

Jennings opens the door without knocking. He stops dead. Three
men are seated round the fire. William, Novello and Henry.
William is surly as he pets his dog.

WILLIAM
Is her ladyship down yet?

JENNINGS
They’re just assembling in the drawing-
room now, sir.

WILLIAM
Well, it won’t kill them to wait five
minutes.

He starts to pour as Weissman comes in behind him, taking a
drink from the tray.

WEISSMAN
Wait for it: Sheehan wants a final
seript by the fifteenth.

IVOR
That's crazy. You‘ve only just worked
out the story.

WILLIAM

INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. EVE.

Jennings is walking toward his own room when Mrs Croft sees him.

MRS CROFT
Oh, Mr Jennings, has that knife turned
up yet?

JENNINGS
Not now.

He goes into his room and shuts the door. Further down the
corridor, Mrs Wilson is watching. Mrs Croft retrieves her
dignity and retreats into the kitchen.

INT. DINING-ROOM. EVE.

Dinner is almost finished. In contrast to the night before, the
atmosphere is terrible. George, Arthur and Elsie are carrying
round the savouries. Jennings pours wine. William is sulking. A
few of the guests are trying to keep things going.

LAVINIA
Goodness, isn't it pretty, here? The
house has such a lovely position.

RAYMOND
The best view’s from the old water
tower. We might walk up there
tomorrow. I suppose you really do have
to get back to London?

ANTHONY
I'm afraid we should. When you're
ruined, there’s such a lot to do.

This succeeds in further flattening the company as well as
exasperating Lavinia and infuriating William. The servants
exchange glances as they labour on round.

CONSTANCE
Would anyone care for a game of bridge
after dinner?

FREDDIE
I wouldn’t mind.

CONSTANCE
Who else? What about you, Louisa?

LOUISA
q don’t think so. I've rather gone off
cards. I've never been very lucky with
them.

Almost inadvertently, she catches William’s eye. He holds her
glance, subdued.

WILLTAM
Nor me.

For some reason, this both annoys Sylvia and spurs her into her
duty as a hostess.

SYLVIA
Tell me again, Mr Weissman, what’s
this film you’re working on?

WEISSMAN
“Charlie Chan in London.” It’s a
detective mystery.

MABEL
Set in London.

WEISSMAN
Not really. Most of it takes place at
a country house-party. Rather like

this one... That’s where the murder
happens.

CONSTANCE
How horrid! And who turns out to have
done it?

WEISSMAN

~ couldn’t tell you that. It‘d spoil
it for you.

CONSTANCE
But none of us will ever see it.

Her rudeness is quite unconscious. Rupert feels sorry for
Weissman.

RUPERT

And are you thinking of making it
here?

WEISSMAN
Oh no. We'll build it in the studio, I
just wanted to experience a little
country living while I was in England
and Ivor was good enough to say he
could fix it for me.

IVOR

It was William who could fix it.
JEREMY

Are you interested in films, sir?
SYLVIA

Not likely.
WILLIAM

Why shouldn’t I be? You don’t know
what I’m interested in.

SYLVIA
Well, I know you’re interested in
money and in fiddling with those
dreary guns but I agree. When it comes
te anything else, I'm stumped.

ELSIE
That’s not fair, is it, Bill? You
always —

With these words, she has broken the basic rule of domestic
service. She has released terrible reverberations by speaking as
she did to William. Not only has she called him ‘Billi,’ she has
engaged in the conversation of the family. The table is as
Silent as the dead, forks are stilled in mid-air, glasses half-
way to lips. Elsie realises that in one tiny second, in less
than a second, she has terminated her employment in that house.
After a moment of total immobility, William throws down his
napkin and storms out.

Raymond is the first to break the silence. With his voice,
normality returns.

RAYMOND
Sylvia, did you ever manage to track
down that magnolia you were after?
Because, if not, I may have rather a
good substitute.

INT. MAIDS’ ATTIC CORRIDOR. EVE.

Mary comes out of her room, heading for the stairs when Elsie,
in tears, pushes past.

MARY
Elsie? What's the matter?

But the girl only goes into the room and slams the door.

INT. DINING-ROOM. EVE.

Mary slips in. George and Arthur, with butler’s trays, are
clearing. George, in baize gloves, helps himself to the end of
the odd wine glass. Lingering in the room are Probert, Barnes,
Sarah, Renee, Robert, Dorothy, Lewis and May.

MARY
it’s true then?

GEORGE
You should have seen it.

RENEE
What's going to happen to her?

LEWIS
She‘1l be lucky if they don’t boot her
out before the morning.

MARY
But she’s worked here so long..

BARNES
Shall I tell you what that means to
them? Bugger all.

PROBERT
Please, Mx Meredith. There are ladies
present... Where is he now?

GEORGE
In the library and he won’t come out
again tonight

At this point the door opens and Jennings appears. He looks
around at the company.

JENNINGS

I’m surprised at you.

DOROTHY
But Mr Jennings —

To her dismay, he simply turns and leaves. George winks at Mary
as he follows.

GEORGE
Bet you're glad you came.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM. EVE.

Janet has brought in a tray. She goes into the dining room as
George takes the tray to hand round the coffee. Constance is at
the bridge table waiting. Rupert is talking softly to Isobel.
Sylvia approaches Ivor by the chimneypiece.

SYLVIA
Ivor, darling, is it too awful to ask
you to play something? And brighten
things up a bit? It would be such a
treat

IVOR
Of course.

He and Weissman walk towards the piano.

WEISSMAN
I've booked a passage and I'11 live on
the ‘phone ‘til I sail. But I have to
get back to London tomorrow. I can go
by train, if you’d rather stay.

IVOR
No, no. I'll take you.

You're providing a lot of
entertainment for nothing.

JEREMY
Good work, old chap. You're doing
awfully well.

RUPERT
You don't understand. I -

George holds the tray for Constance who looks up as she pours
herself a cup at Mabel lingering for a moment by the card table
behind Freddie.

CONSTANCE
My maid was saying how sensible you
are to travel light. After all, why
should one wear a different frock
every evening. We're not in a fashion
parade.

The players have drawn for dealer and Constance has won. As
Isobel cuts the cards for her, Mabel wanders over to the piano
in her humiliation.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. EVE.

Robert and Mary are walking towards one of the two green baize
doors.

ROBERT
How could she let him touch her?

MARY
You sound as if you don’t like him.

Rupert whispers to Isobel over their cards.
RUPERT
I was wondering if we could have a

word later.

ISOBEL
Of course. If you like.

Constance

Nearby, Jeremy winks in approval, which Isobel notices. As

Constance has won the bidding, Freddie is dummy. Having laid out

his cards, he stands.

FREDDIE
I won't be a minute.

He walks to the door. Mabel, by the piano, watches him go.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. EVE.

Mrs Wilson appears with a tray of coffee things. She crosses the

hall.

INT. LIBRARY. EVE.

William works at his gun table. The tools of his hobby surround
him. He has re-routed his rage and now he files a metal part

with angry passion and finesse. The door opens.

WILLIAM
What do you want?
MRS WILSON
I’ve brought you some coffee.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM. EVE

Ivor is still singing. The house-party has had enough. Rupert is
dealing the next hand.

CONSTANCE
You‘re spoiling us, Mr Novello. Quel
embarras de richesses...Where on earth

JEREMY
I'll play if you like. Until he gets
back.

He sits between the lovers. At the other end of the room,
Anthony silently steals from the room. Lavinia starts towards
him,

LAVINIA
Anthony -

But he has gone. She returns to her seat on the sofa. Meanwhile,
Jennings, near the door, is in heaven. George tips the remainder
of the milk jug into a cup. He then turns to the enraptured
butler and whispers to him.

GEORGE
Better get some more milk, Mr
Jennings... I won’t be a moment.

He holds the empty jug for Jennings to see. He goes to the
dining-room door.

INT. DINING-ROOM. EVE

As he comes in, Janet and May have paused in their clearing.
Arthur stands unashamedly by the connecting door. George almost

SARAH
Where’s Mr Denton?

The others 'sssh' her, further emphasising the illicitness of
their presence.

LEWIS
This isn't right, Mr Probert.

PROBERT
Oh, go on. We're not the only ones.

He nods towards Mary standing listening a little way off. She
smiles guiltily.

MARY

She looks round and to her surprise, he has gone.

MARY (CONT'D)

Mrs Croft, the kitchen maids and Dorothy listen. Mrs Wilson

MRS WILSON
What’s going on? Dorothy. Get on with

Henry arrives at a door and knocks gently. Elsie opens it. She
has been crying but she is calm now.

ELSIE
Yes? What do you want?

HENRY
I thought you might need cheering up...

ELSIE
Did you? Well, you were wrong.

She shuts the door, leaving him alone.
INT. /EXT. BACK DOOR/COURTYARD. NIGHT.

The door opens and a pair of male legs and feet, clad in black
trousers and shoes appear (it could be any of the men, above or
below stairs). It is raining and, for a second, the feet
hesitate. Their owner appears to spy some large, muddy walking
over-shoes left by a gardener in the porch. The man slips his
feet, still in their black pumps, into them. There is a noise.
He freezes. Mrs Croft appears through the crack of the open
door. She pulls it to and we hear the bolt. After a moment the
legs approach. They strain but the door won’t budge.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM. NIGHT.

Constance, bored to sobs, looks around as she takes a liqueur
from Jennings.

CONSTANCE
Where’s Anthony? You don’t suppose
he’s gone to worry William again, do

SYLVIA
Even Anthony couldn’t be that stupid.

Mabel looks over sharply at Constance who greets her with a
cheery smile.

INT. LIBRARY. NIGHT,

A secret door in the bookshelves opens gently as the booted feet
slip in. Leaving a trail of mud, he moves softly across the
floor until William’s feet come into view. The camera moves up
to reveal William in a fiercely concentrated position, holding
some part of a gun quite still. He seems frozen. The empty glass
is on its side on the table. The hand of the intruder lifts into
sight. It is covered in a green baize glove, the type we have
seen in Scenes 15 and 61 and it holds the missing knife. With a
semi-circular arc, the blade flashes down, over William’s
shoulder and into his heart. Silently, William slumps forward
onto the table, his face crushed into the tools of his hobby.
Below him, the wretched Pip whines. After a fraction of a
second, the unknown assailant retreats. The concealed bookcase
door closes behind him.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM. NIGHT.

Freddie returns. Jeremy makes to rise but Freddie stops him as
Mabel comes over.

FREDDIE
No, no. Finish the hand.

MABEL
Where have you been?

FREDDIE
Never mind.

Now Anthony Meredith slides back into the room. In answer to
Lavinia's enquiries, he just shakes his head reassuringly.
George returns with the jug. Jennings speaks sharply under his
breath.

JENNINGS
Well if that’s a ‘moment’ I’d like to
know what happens when you take a real
break. Now give her ladyship some more
coffee.

George takes the tray and approaches Sylvia. She holds out her
cup.

SYLVIA

Would you, really? He much prefers you

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR / RED SALOON. NIGHT.

Mary, Probert and Lewis are still listening as Robert rejoins
them. He carries two hot water bottles and hands one over to
Mary. It is in a cover bearing the coronetted ‘T.’

ROBERT
Here. I did yours as well. Before the
rush starts.

Probert and Lewis acknowledge it is time to get to work. They
walk away, past the door of the red saloon where we see Louisa.
In front of her, Pip noses his way out of the almost closed
library door and looks around. Louisa picks him up.

LOUISA
Come here you horrid little thing.
William, I -

But the rest of her speech is swallowed in a scream. At once,
the music stops. The guests, followed by the different groups of
listening servants, cluster into the red saloon. Isobel cranes
forward but Rupert shields her until a sob from Probert brings
them all to the door of the library. Mabel screams.

GEORGE
Bleedin' hell...

The body of Sir William McCordle is slumped over his work table.
The eyes are open in the red face and the tongue is lolling out.
It is clear that Sir William is very dead.

EXT. GOSFORD PARK. NIGHT.

A police car arrives. The driver, Constable Dexter, is joined by
Inspector Thompson. Vain and clottish, he feels he belongs
‘upstairs’. The house party will not agree

INT. SERVANTS' HALL. NIGHT.

The servants are all seated round the table. Some of them,
including Elsie, are in dressing-gowns. The atmosphere is mixed.
The news is shocking but not particularly sad. Apart from Elsie
and the upper servants, many of them, even the resident staff,
hardly knew William except by sight. The ‘front door’ bell
jangles on the bellboard.

JENNINGS
I‘l1l go.

Jennings leaves. Elsie is sobbing aloud. Mrs Croft leans over
and squeezes her hand. She speaks softly but loud enough for
Bertha to hear her.

MRS CROFT
Come on, love. No man's worth it. At
any rate, he isn't.

JANET
What are you going to do now, Mr
Probert?

PROBERT

T don’t know.. I can’t think straight...

GEORGE
When I leave here, I want to open a
garage... Nothing gawdy. Just enough for
a decent living.

RENEE
That's a funny ambition for a footman.
Why aren’t you a chauffeur?

LEWIS
I don’t understand. Head footman in a
house like this! You could be a butler

Weissman is on the telephone as Jennings crosses to the front
door .

WEISSMAN

agreed it was a birdshoot.. Why is fox
hunting more cinematic? Who said
that?...Oh... Well, OK, if it’s a big
deal, make it a fox humt but what the
hell are we doing here?

Jennings opens the door to the two policemen.

JENNINGS
We've been expecting you.

THOMPSON
Good evening. I’m Inspector Thomp —

Sylvia strides purposefully towards them, talking as she does
so.

SYLVIA
You must be the police.

Just so. I’m Inspector Thomp —

SYLVIA
I'm Lady Sylvia MecCordle. We haven't
moved him but I didn’t know whether to
ring for a doctor or not. William's
real one’s in London and it seemed
very hard to wake him at this time of

night.

THOMPSON
The police doctor will be here ina
minute.

SYLVIA

Good. I mean I suppose it doesn’t
really matter if it’s a stroke or a
heart attack or whatever but we might
as well get it right.. Let’s go
straight to the red drawing-room. I've
got everyone rounded up there.

Thompson glances at Weissman who is getting heated but Sylvia is
in control.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
Oh, don’t mind him. He's just an
American who’s staying with us.

She has led them into the saloon, Jennings follows. All the
upstairs members of the party are gathered in varying states of
shock. Pip is in the corner, whining.

SYLVIA (CONT'D)
I‘d better tell you who we all are
then we can go to bed and leave you
with poor William. Is that a good
plan?

DEXTER
Do we need to worry them just now,
sir? We could do it in the -

THOMPSON (CONT'D)
I once had the pleasure of serving on
a committee with the late Barl.. I’m
only sorry we have to meet in such
tragic circumstances.

His pompous enunciating of Constance’s full title tells her
everything about his petit bourgeois origins. She wasn’t aware
that they were ‘meeting’ at all. Sylvia continues.

SYLVIA
My brother-in-law, Lord Stockbridge.
My sister, Lady Stockbridge, ...my
youngest sister, Lady Lavinia
Meredith, and her husband, Commander
Meredith. Mr Novello, I suppose you
knew that without my telling
you...That'1ll be all, thank you
Jemnings...no, wait. Would you like to
talk to any of the servants tonight,
Inspector —

THOMPSON
Thomo —

SYLVIA
Perhaps you should see Probert. My
poor husband’s valet. Would you tell
him to come up, Jennings? Now, where
was I? This is Mr and Mrs Nesbitt, my
daughter, Miss McCordle, Lord Rupert
Standish and Mr Blond...

But Jennings has picked up Pip and left before she has finished
the list.

INT. SERVANTS’ HALL. NIGHT.

They are still seated as Jennings enters. He gives Pip to the
odd man who takes the dog reluctantly. After a moment, Mrs Croft
speaks

MRS CROFT
Well? Don’t leave us on tenterhooks.

JENNINGS
The police would like to see you for a
moment, Mr Probert.

PROBERT

Me? Why? I don’t know what I can tell
them...

sympathetic glances

JENNINGS
There’s no point in the rest of you
waiting up.

ELSIE
What about me, Mr Jennings?

JENNINGS
You can leave as soon as the police
release you. I dare say that'll be
some time tomorrow.

MRS WILSON
Until then stay in your room.

ELSIE
I’m not contagious, you know.

BARNES
I‘m sorry, Mr Jennings, but my two
want to get away. So we'll be off
early.

JENNINGS
Neobody’s going anywhere... Now, those of
you with remaining duties, see to them
as quickly as you can. Otherwise, good
night everyone.

He stands aside to let them pass. We hear some exchanges about
the dog as they go. ‘What's going to happen to it?' ‘I should
think she'll have it put down.''Best thing for it, nasty little
beast.''No one can stand it except Sir William.' Alone among
them, Elsie gives the animal a stroke. ‘Don't do that, dear.
He'll have your hand off.' While this is going on, Henry
hesitates, unusually ill at ease.

JENNINGS (CONT'D)
Yes, Mr Weissman?

HENRY
I’m afraid I have a confession to
make..
He speaks in an American accent.

INT. ELSIE’S ATTIC ROOM. NIGHT.

The two young women lie, trying to sleep. Elsie’s half~packed
case is visible.

MARY
I’m really sorry... about everything...

ELSIE

Don’t feel sorry for me. Pity that
poor Dorothy. She’s got all the early
morning teas to do, then trays and
she’s got to get Miss Isobel down to
the dining-room — if she can find
anything in black. I’m well out of it.
She's the one who needs your sympathy.

MARY
E should think Miss Isobel might stay
in bed tomorrow.

ELSIE
Unmarried girls don’t have breakfast
trays. Not at this house.

They are silent for a bit.

MARY
I wish I could help.

ELSIE
Well, you can’t.

INT. STOCKBRIDGE BEDROOM. NIGHT

Renee is arranging the blanket cover on the bed. Behind her,
Louisa sits at the dressing-table, wiping her eyes. In an open
doorway, Raymond stands quite still as Robert slides his gown on
and then comes round to set the lapels and tie the sash.

ROBERT
Is that everything, m‘lord?

RAYMOND

Yes, thank you, Parks. I think we'd

INT. SALOON. NIGHT.

George is tidying up. He gives a cold glance over to where Henry
is helping himself, Weissman and Novello to brandy from a tray.
Ivor remarks his expression.

WEISSMAN
That’s the main problem. Fox hasn't
got anyone. Apart from a few washed-up
silent stars.. How are you getting on?

HENRY
Mrs Wilson's put me in the meanest
room she could find.

IVOR
What did you expect? The State
Bedchamber? You've made them feel like @
idiots. And they don’t like it.. Has

anyone told Sylvia?

WEISSMAN
She‘1ll be OK. She can take a joke.

Henry and Ivor exchange a look. They are not so sure.

IVOR
You‘d better be the one to say it. I
should go now. Before she hears it
from someone else.

WEISSMAN
But don't tell her ‘til afterwards. I
wouldn’t want to spoil it for her.
Tonight of all nights.

His bitter tone does not merit an answer. Henry goes to the
door. Weissman follows.

He goes. Weissman turns disconsolately back into the room.

IVOR
That's not like you. Don’t tell me
you're jealous. He's not in the least
interested, you know. He’s just using
you.

WEISSMAN
Why shouldn’t he? I’m using him. It’s
a deal and I stick to my deals... I'm
just surprised McCordle was right
about her, that’s all.

IVOR
I suppose a man knows his own wife.
Besides, she has a point. Good-looking
servants are the best. They don’t dine

INT. SYLVIA‘S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

Sylvia, dry-eyed, lies on her bed as a sniffing Lewis goes round
turning off the lights.

LEWIS
T’/ll say goodnight then, milady.
Unless you'd like me stay with you?

Lewis goes. Sylvia crosses to the window. A noise tells her
Henry has come in. He stands, hesitating to speak.

SYLVIA
What is it? Please tell me you haven't
come with condolences.

She looks very beautiful and he is reluctant to jeopardise his
fun.

embarrassed,

THOMPSON
Try and pull yourself together, Mr
Probert. I know it's hard but iff you
could be patient. They’1l be here any
minute...

PROBERT
Couldn't I just make him comfortable,
sir? Please?

William, his face crushed into his tool collection, does look
very uncomfortable in his present position. Probert’s grief has
brought Ivor and Weissman to the door.

IVOR
Come on, Inspector

DEXTER
It wouldn't be wise, sir. And it's not
long to wai -

THOMPSON
Oh, very well. I don't suppose it can
do any harm.

Probert takes hold of the dead man’s shoulders. Is there a
moment of tenderness? He gives a cry and the body falls back. As
William's arms flop open and his head drops back, mouth gaping,
his chest is revealed. The handle of the knife protrudes from
it. By this time, Weissman has joined them. The five live men
stare at the dead one.

THOMPSON (CONT'D)
Right. Well. Now you can see why we
have the rules.. Yes, Dexter? What is

It’s a good question.
EXT. GOSFORD PARK. EARLY MORNING.

The dawn of a new day. An undecorated hearse, laden with a
coffin, drives away. The only sign of life is the small dog
watching sadly from the steps.

INT. KITCHEN. EARLY MORNING.

The scullery maid blows on the range fire, trying to get it
going. Bertha is laying out breakfast food. Ellen puts the
silver entrée dishes in the warmer. Mrs Croft consults a menu
book and writes her proposals for the day. Pip sniffs around.

BERTHA
George says Mr Novello was in on it.
And Six William. He says it was a joke
on Lady Sylvia but I can’t see that...
The point is he’s playing a butler in
the next Charlie Chan and he wanted to
make it authentic.

ELLEN
Well, he’d better not model his
performance on Mr Jennings or they'll
think he’s as stiff as a board.

Their laughter is stilled as Thompson‘s head looks round the
door. They all freeze, watching him. At first he faces the wrong
way and so the room must appear empty to him. Then Ellen giggles
and he spins round, stands and enters. Dexter is with him.

‘THOMPSON
Ah... Mrs Croft? I wonder if you could
spare a few minutes. My name’s
Inspector Thomp —

MRS CROFT

INT. MRS CROFT’S ROOM. DAY

Mxs Croft has ushered Thompson into a cosy, little room at the
back. He glances at an old tinted photograph of a baby in blue
ribbons on her desk.

THOMPSON
My word, but you've a bonny lad there.
What‘s he up to these days?

MRS CROFT
He’s dead.

Once again, his jocularity has failed. He smiles nervously. Mrs
Croft is quite cold.

MRS CROFT (CONT'D)
I don‘t know what I can tell you.
Shouldn't you be looking for signs of
a break-in?

THOMPSON
I gather there’s no one here who’s
worked for Sir William longer than you
have.. Sad day...

it wasn’t in the silver pantry. It's

Isobel, in night things, is discussing it all with Elsie who is
now in civilian clothes.

he take anything?

ELSIE
No, but.. I s’pose he ran for it.. when
he saw what he’d done... Are you going

ISOBEL (CONT'D)

ELSIE
What is it?

Isobel hands it over.

ELSIE (CONT'D)
‘This is your final warning. If I have
not received an offer from your father
by luncheon tomorrow, I will tell him
everything. Freddie.’ Stupid idiot. At
least he’s off your back. That's
something. He's got no one to tell
now. At least, no one who'd give him a
job to shut him up

ISOBEL
You can’t be sure. He might tell
Rupert just for the fun of it.. No @
doubt I'll hear from him soon enough.

The girl shrugs, limp with misery.

ELSIE
I‘d better be off. I might not see you
again. I’m only staying ‘til the
police give the nod.

ISOBEL
You're not in any.. difficulty, are
you?

ELSIE

Other than having no job and no home,
you mean?

She relents, lightly stroking her stomach. Isobel, after all,
has done her no harm.

They're bound to cancel the shooting
today.

ROBERT
Why?

The others are silenced for a moment by his response. Then:

MARY

RENEE
If I were her, I'd go to London. Set
up as a glamorous widow with all the
gentlemen chasing me for my money.

Is that where the orphanage was?

ROBERT
On the edge. Isleworth.

MARY
And you don’t get homesick?

DEXTER

It might be more sensible if I drove
you down to the village, sir.

THOMPSON
Thank you, Dexter. I know what I'm

He is very important as he considers the exposed position of the

BARNES
So? What was he saying?

course I want you to wake him up. How

Rupert, Jeremy and Raymond are eating while Jennings stands by.
Constance, choosing her food, looks up as the Merediths come in.
The men read newspapers -

CONSTANCE
Good morning, dear. Have you heard?
Too tiresome. That frightful inspector
won't let anyone leave! So we're to be
treated to another day of Mr Weissman
shouting down the telephone.

TVOR
He has a problem with his work in Los
Angeles, I’m afraid.

CONSTANCE
Well, he conducts his business very
oddly. Coming down stairs just now, I
thought I’d been transported to a bar
in Marseilles.

Ivor doesn’t contradict which is the right way to handle her.

CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
I gather they carted poor William off
this morning. So strange and sad. Will
they want to delay the funeral? I do

day like this we all have to pull our

The door opens and Isobel enters. Her black frock and air of
sadness cast a pall on the room. Rupert jumps up to help her
with breakfast and Jeremy looks on.

EXT. KITCHEN COURT. DAY.

Robert is emerging from the laundry. In one corner of the yard
is a game larder. Ellen is there holding some birds and Bertha
comes out with more. She nods at Robert.

ROBERT
Do you want a hand?

He relieves her of some of the birds as Pip jumps up at them.

ROBERT (CONT'D)
Get away! Ugh. These smell as if they
could walk in on their own. I don't
know how they can eat them like that.

ELLEN
You heard Mr Denton's made a right
chump out of Mr Jennings

BERTHA
Never mind that. What about Sir
William? Apparently he wasn’t stabbed
after all. I mean he was but that’s
not why he died.. He was poisoned
That's what killed him. The Inspector
told Mrs Croft. They don’t know why
the killer stabbed him as well but he
must have been dead already. That's
why there was no blood. Dead bodies
don’t bleed, you know.

Robert looks at her. She’s awfully proud to have the facts.

poison. Probert watches but does not help

ARTHUR
Did he say anything about changing his
will, Mr Probert?

PROBERT
Not in so many words...

They all look at the valet. Clearly he does know something
whatever he says.

PROBERT (CONT'D)
Well, I remember him looking at a
picture of her ladyship a week or two
age... the one on the tallboy in his
dressing-room where she’s laughing...
Anyway, he said ‘her nose is due for
re-setting’ and I said ‘why’ and he
said ‘cos it’s about to go out of
joint.’

ARTHUR
Except it isn’t.

GEORGE
Exactly.

ARTHUR
Why do you think he was murdered, Mr
Jennings?

JENNINGS
Don’t talk nonsense. Of course he
wasn’t murdered! Not like that. Some
ruffian broke in, thinking the library
was empty, Sir William surprised him
and paid the price for it. And very
tragic it is, too.

JENNINGS
What are you suggesting?
GEORGE
i'm not suggesting anything. Just.
JENNINGS
Just what?
GEORGE

Well, it looks to me like Sir William
was killed by someone who meant to do
it. That's all. No wonder they won’t
let anyone leave. Tough luck on
whoever’s got any secrets to hide.

JENNINGS
If you can only talk rubbish, George,
I suggest you don’t talk at all.

George’s tone was almost jocular. Jennings’s is not. George

But wasn’t it risky? With factory
girls? Suppose they’d complained?

MRS CROFT
Who to, exactly?
BERTHA
But suppose they got...?
MAUD
Got what?
MRS CROFT

I don't know why you're looking so
shocked. Didn't happen that often but
if it did, he'd arrange an adoption.

BERTHA
But if you didn't want it adopted? Té
you wanted to keep it?

MRS CROFT
Then you lost your job. Kicked out.
You take my word for it. He was a hard-
hearted randy old sod.

EXT. KITCHEN COURT. DAY.

Lewis stands in the back entrance watching as her mistress
canters into the yard. To the maid’s surprise, Raymond steps out
of the shadows. He hurries to Sylvia as she dismounts. We can
only just hear that Sylvia is indignant. “Why shouldn’t I? I
wanted some air.” Raymond appears to be remonstrating as soon as
the groom leads the horse away. Drawn by curiosity, Lewis edges
nearer until she is within earshot.

RAYMOND
They seem to be asking a whole Lot of
questions about things that can’t
possibly have anything to do with
William’s death... and I thought...

He hesitates, noticing the approaching maid.

SYLVIA
Never mind Lewis. The Seal of the
Confessional’s got nothing on her. Has
it, Lewis?

LEWIS
I should hope not, milady.

Sylvia smiles at her indignation, addressing Raymond in a stage
whisper.

SYLVIA
She's rather anti-Catholic... So?

RAYMOND
It’s only that the police seem to be
raking about, looking for their grubby
motives, and I don't want them muddled
with with silly tales from the distant
past...

SYLVIA
But darling, you're quite safe. I'm
sure it's not illegal. Even for
someone who does it as badly as you
do.

(CONTINUED )
112
105 CONTINUED:

She shares this with Lewis who, despite the personal morality of
a Carmelite nun, delights in her mistress's defeat of a mere

man.

RAYMOND
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You say things to be funny that can‘t
be unsaid...And it's not important.

SYLVIA
But isn't it for them to say what's
important and what isn't? Yes, Lewis?
What is it?

LEWIS
The Inspector's been asking for you,
milady, and I wanted you to know... he’s
been talking to the lawyers in
London...

SYLVIA
Has he, indeed? Well, he’1ll have to
wait. I want a bath. Who’s in the
firing line at the moment?

LEWIS
I think Lady Trentham’s in the library
just now, milady.

SYLVIA
God help them.

106 INT. LIBRARY. DAY.

Mary is by the. door. Thompson has been talking to Constance.
Dexter is an observer.

THOMPSON

Inspector Thomp —

CONSTANCE
There you are, Mary. This is all too
tiresome and absurd. They're making
the greatest fuss over —

questions I‘d like to ask the young
lady.

CONSTANCE
Well, I'm certainly not leaving if
that’s what you think.

Thompson looks to Dexter. This is just the kind of woman he
could do without.

THOMPSON
Would it bother you if Lady Trentham
stays?

MARY

Why should it?

THOMPSON
No reason. Only... we understand that
there may have been some difficulty
between the late Sir William McCordle
and your employer —

CONSTANCE
Really, this is too vulgar almost to
be believed —

MARY
I wasn’t aware of that, sir. They got
on well as far as I could see.

Constance relaxes with a superior smile at Thompson as he flails
about.

THOMPSON
So you weren’t conscious of any
trouble over an allowance? An
allowance, I might add, that Sir
William’s death has now made secure.

MARY
What sort of an allowance would that
be, six?

Constance regards the girl with far more interest than she has
ever done before.

107 INT. IRONING AND SEWING ROOM. DAY.

Dorothy is mending a black dress. She looks up. Jennings is in

Miss Isobel’s only got two black

JENNINGS
I’m sorry the business with Elsie’s
landed you with so much work. That's
what you get for being so reliable.

This comment, simply meant, lights a fire in Dorothy's soul.

DOROTHY
Never mind me.. Have you spoken to the
police again?

JENNINGS
Not yet.

DOROTHY
I suppose they have to ask their
questions.

JENNINGS
Oh yes...

DOROTHY
Will they be talking to all of us?

JENNINGS
I shouldn’t think so...Well, I'll
leave you to it. I could ask Miss
Lewis to give you a hand with that if
you like...

Plainly he is distracted with some sort of worry. She looks at
him tenderly.

DOROTHY
No need. It’s nearly done.. Mr
Jennings.. You know I‘d say anything
you want me to.

JENNINGS
What?

DOROTHY
Anything at all. I don’t care what I

INT. LIBRARY. DAY

George is arranging tea on a table for Thompson, Dexter and
Sylvia.

THOMPSON
No. The point I’m trying to make is
only that if he had signed it, then
your position would have been quite
altered.

SYLVIA
I suppose so. But he didn’t.

THOMPSON
Precisely.. May I pour you some tea?

In his brain, he is Poirot as he reaches down and picks up the
milk jug.

SYLVIA
How kind you are. But could you bear
to put my milk in afterwards?

She smiles, enjoying his gaffe as he clumsily replaces the jug
and picks up the pot

INT, JENNINGS’S ROOM. DAY.
Gathered at the door, the servants listen to Jennings.

JENNINGS
t assume, by this time, you all know
that Mr Denton has played a trick on
us in posing as a valet. Since Sir
William was aware of the plan, it is
not for me, or any of you, to
criticise it. However, it leaves us
with a few adjustments to make for
this evening. Arthur, you can take
over dressing Mr Weissman. Which
leaves us with the problem of Mr
Novello. I really don’t want to ask Mr
Probert.

ARTHUR
I don’t mind, Mr Jennings.

Arthur's hopes are dashed again. Robert looks up.

That's very generous of you, Mr
Stockbridge. Otherwise, I could always
do him, myself.

ROBERT
No, no. It’s no trouble. It’s only for
a night or two.

JENNINGS
Good. That's settled then. And I think
Mr Denton can dress himself. Thank you
all. You can go

With Lewis muttering ‘cheeky beggar,’ they file out leaving only
Probert and Mrs Wilson. Jennings goes to a table where he has a
bottle of port, a decanter, a glass and a funnel. He starts to
open and then taste and decant the port with care.

JENNINGS (CONT'D)
I’m giving them a glass of the 1912
tonight. They’1]l need a bit of
cheering up.

MRS WILSON
What about you, Mr Probert? How are
you getting on? Have you made any
plans yet?

PROBERT
I think I’11 go to my sister’s for a
week or two. Sort something out. I've
an idea she and I might open a little
hotel together, well, a B and B

Maybe we're nothing but a race of

He smiles sadly at his little joke. His next words confirm this
is the end of an era.

JENNINGS (CONT'D)
As a matter of fact, I too may be
leaving here soon.

MRS WILSON
IT very much hope not.

JENNINGS
Me too. Me too.. but one is not Always

MRS WILSON
There are worse people than you in

INT. BOOT ROOM. DAY.

Robert and Mary are cleaning evening shoes. They wear aprons and

INT. LIBRARY/UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. DAY.
Barnes, the valet, is being questioned.

THOMPSON (VO)
‘The bastard’s death may have saved my
bacon...” What do you think he meant by
that?

Nothing is obvious to Thompson.

Perhaps he meant that the investment

Captain Meredith to join us.

BARNES
You won't... tell him what I said, will
you, Inspector — ?

THOMPSON
Thompson. My name is Inspector
Thompson. Now please fetch him down.

Barnes, slightly unnerved by the anger he has released,
retreats. As he closes the door, we can hear Weissman on the
telephone. Barnes walks past him through the hall.

WEISSMAN
You tell me: Who is Ray Milland? O.K.
but no Clara Bow, no Janet Gaynor.
Tell him I’1l sign Milland if we can
be free of the un-dead.. No, the study
was fine. No the shoot-out in the
study is fine. Yes, I'm sure. Philip
may be writing it but I’m living it.
The stables? Why would anyone be
murdered in the stables?.. What is it
with Sheehan and these fucking horses?

1l2 INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. EVE.

George is smoking and gossiping with Arthur. Nearby May and
Janet are unloading coal scuttles full of a mixture of coal and
debris from the upstairs fires. The men make no effort to help.

ELSIE
Pssst!

They look up. Elsie is above them on the stairs. Again, she is
wearing her own clothes.

GEORGE
They’11 be coming in a minute. The
dressing bell’s just gone.

ELSIE
I'm going mad up there.. I’ve read all

RENEE

I don’t think mine’s bothered. She
hasn’t got any black here, anyway.

MARY
Funny lot, aren't they? When you think
about it. Changing for dinner on a day
like this —

She breaks off as Henry Denton appears, behind Elsie, on the
stairs. There is a pause.

BARNES
Well. We are honoured. In case you've
forgotten, this is the servants’ area.
Six. Yours is on the other side of the
door at the top, there. Sir.

HENRY
It was just.. I wanted to explain.

GEORGE
No explanation’s necessary, Mr Denton,
now if you’11l excuse us, we have work
to do. Come on, Arthur.

The footmen take the scuttles and go. The others push past him.
Robert is the last.

HENRY
Robert, surely... It was just a laugh...

ROBERT
Then perhaps you'd better enjoy your
laugh in the drawing~room, sir.

He speaks without malice but, having spoken, he too is gone.
Elsie speaks.

Robert is walking down the gallery. He hears voices coming from
an open doorway.

ISOBEL
You can tell him but he won't give you
any money...and Mummy wouldn't pay
five pounds to save me from the
gallows

FREDDIE
Don't keep talking as if I was
enjoying this. What I wanted was a
job...

As Robert reaches them, by Isobel's door, they are silent. Then,
after he has passed:

ISOBEL
My chequebook's in the library. I'll
do it after dinner.

Freddie leaves as Robert is hailed by Raymond at the far end of
the gallery. Before the valet can reach him, Raymond sees
Anthony approach, looking haggard.

RAYMOND
You look as if you've had rather a
pasting.

ANTHONY

They kept on and on about that low
shot yesterday...They wouldn't let it
go. I told them it was nothing to do
with me.

With a quick "very good, m'lord", Robert moves off. Anthony has
been hovering, trying to get a word in.

ANTHONY
Raymond, I don't know why you -

RAYMOND
I saw you. Of course it was an
accident. When a man's as short as you
are, it must be hard to gauge the
height of the birds. But, next time,
do be more careful. Please.

His tone is quite dismissive as he goes into the room and shuts

the door, leaving Anthony completely humiliated in front of the
valet.

Constance is finishing her toilet with Mary’s help

MARY
You heard he was cutting Lady Sylvia
out in favour of Miss Isobel?

CONSTANCE
That’s nothing. Wait for this...in the
new will he‘d left Lady Stockbridge a
hundred thousand pounds. Can you
imagine? Sylvia thinks it’s a huge
joke. Particularly since she won’t
have to pay it.

MARY
But were they...?

CONSTANCE
Well, as the saying goes, the time to
make up your mind about people is
never... Which reminds me, I haven't
complimented you on how you managed

frame and is guided into the shoe.

I feel a little bruised.

He glances out of the dark window. When he speaks, he does not
turn to her.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
Why is it, would you say, that some
people seem to get whatever they want
in life? Everything they touch turns
to gold. While others can strive and
Strive... and have nothing.

He looks across with a face devoid of hope. Still she stands,
listening.

ANTHONY (CONT'D)
I wonder... Do you believe in luck? Do
you think some men are lucky and some
just.. aren’t, and there’s nothing they
can do about it?

Dorothy ponders for a moment. Of course he has asked her own
question.

DOROTHY
I believe in love. Not just getting
it.. giving it. I think as long as you

Turning to say this, her eye is caught by Isobel handing
something to Freddie by the door. Louisa speaks from the card
table as she takes a drink from Jennings.

Mabel and Freddie are talking softly as Jennings arrives back at
the drinks table

MABEL

I...Z thought you'd like to know that
Mabel Nesbitt left this on my dressing~
table...I think it's over

She hands Elsie an envelope with the torn cheque and a note.
Elsie nods, pleased.

ISOBEL (CONT'D)
And I just wanted to be certain...You
never did speak to Daddy about it that
night? About Freddie and everything?

ELSIE
I told you. I never had a moment...

TSOBEL
No, I'm glad...that he wasn't bothered
with it before he...Well...I suppose
I'd better go...Good luck, Elsie.

ELSIE
Good luck to you, Miss.

A thoughtful Elsie holds the door as Tsobel slips away. Mary
looks curiously at her companion.

ELSIE (CONT'D)
Don't ask.

MARY
Do you think Sir William was in love
with you?

ELSIE
Nah, I was a bit of fun, that’s all.

MARY
What about you?

ELSIE
dn‘t love him but.. I didn’t mind
I liked the way he’d talk.

He only talked to me ‘cos he was sick

me I could be anything I wanted... if I
wanted it enough...

MARY
You're not sorry, then. Even with the
way it’s turned out.

ELSIE
No. I'm not sorry... it’s time for a
change. Who knows? Might be the making
of me. What was it ‘e used to say?
Carpe Diem. Sieze the day.

This strikes a chord with Mary. She gets out of bed and puts on
her dressing-gown.

ELSIE (CONT'D)
What’s up? What have I said? Where are
you off to?

INT. ROBERT'S ATTIC ROOM. NIGHT.

Robert is sitting on his bed. The door opens. It is Mary. He is
dumbfounded

ROBERT
What are you doing here?

But she is silent, trembling in her sad little, candlewick
dressing~gown.

ROBERT (CONT'D)
You'd better get back to your room.
They mustn’t find you up here.

For a moment, she cannot decide if she wants to put the next
question.

MARY
You didn’t really dislike him, did
you..? Not really..? At least... not
enough to kill him..

But he says nothing. Her eyes fill.
MARY (CONT'D)
You can’t have! You didn't know him!

You'd have to hate him and why would
you?

{CONTINUED )
134
128 CONTINUED:

She is so desperate that he should not be guilty. Robert’s eyes
meet hers

ROBERT
Can’t a man hate his own father?

Mary could scarcely be more shocked if he’d hit her. She stares
at him,

ROBERT (CONT'D)
Sir William McCordle was my father. He
didn't know it. But he was.

MARY
But.. you said you were an orphan.

ROBERT
I said I grew up in an orphanage.

Now he decides to tell a little bit of the truth.

ROBERT (CONT'D)
Not long before I left, a group of us
got into the Warden’s office one
night. We unpicked the lock and took
out our files. It was a prank, really.
I didn’t expect any shocking
discoveries, Just a birth certificate
with my mother's name and ‘father
unknown'. This picture was with it.

She takes the picture and studies it.

MARY
But how did Sir William come into it?

ROBERT
They had my admission form. I was two
days old. Guess who brought me to the
door .

MARY
But that doesn’t mean —

ROBERT
Yes it does. After that, I found out.
She was a factory worker.She wasn't
the only one.. either the authorities
didn't know or they didn’t want to
know.They took the babies and they
took his donations.

MARY
What happened to her?

ROBERT
I asked them once. She died. When I
was little.. I always say she died of a
broken heart but it was probably
cyrrosis of the liver... “Broken heart”
sounds a bit nicer, don‘t you think?

MARY
Is that why you took the job with Lord
Stockbridge? To get to Sir William? To
poison him?

ROBERT
I didn't poison him.
MARY
What?
ROBERT
I didn't poison him.
( This is wonderful news.
MARY

But then you didn't kill him...Tell me
you didn't stab him either.

At this he is silent. Nevertheless it is still good news.

MARY (CONT'D)
I know you didn't. I'm sure you
didn't...Even if you did, that didn't
kill him. And whoever did it knew
that. No one could stab a corpse and
not know it.

ROBERT
Is that right? When did you last stab
a corpse?

MARY

But...who really murdered him?

ROBERT
T don‘t know. And I don’t care.

With those words, she knows her theory is correct. The mood has

altered between them. He comes to her. When he takes her in his
ad arms, she does not resist his kiss.

INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING.

The morning light glints through the drawn curtains. The door
opens softly and Janet, the little housemaid, wearing a long,
‘kneeling’ apron and carrying a bucket of coal tiptoes to the
fire. She puts on thick, felt gloves and sets to work.

HENRY (VO)
Who is it?

The voice startles the girl. She turns. He sits up.

JANET
I‘m ever so sorry, sir.

HENRY
Sorry for what?

JANET
I'm supposed to get the fire lit
without waking you.

HENRY
Why does everyone treat me as if I was
just one of the guests? I spent half
the week downstairs with you all.

JANET
But you can’t be on both teams at
once, sir.

HENRY
More's the pity.

He is sad as he watches her light the fire. With a nervous bob,
she hurries out.

INT. MRS CROFT’S ROOM. DAY.

Jennings... Did you tell them any of
that stuff in the end?

MRS CROFT
I did not. I’m sorry if I shock you,
Bertha, but the plain fact is he only
got what he deserved. There. I’ve said
ait.

BERTHA
I can’t stop thinking about those
girls..the ones that got...you know...

MRS CROFT
I don't wonder at it. The way you

happens to you, my girl.

She is severe but not unkind. Tt is clear that she knows what
Bertha is up to.

BERTHA
But the ones who kept their
babies...who wouldn't give them
up...Didn't he ever let them back?

MRS CROFT
There was one time... but.. that was
because her baby died...

But Mrs Croft has said enough. With a sigh, she stands. It is
the beginning of a new working day.

MRS CROFT (CONT'D)
Come on. Enough of this gabbing. Let’s
get started.

She moves away from her desk, revealing once more the poignant
little tinted photograph of the long-dead, unforgotten infant.

Jennings is bringing his cellar list up to date. Dexter looks

JENNINGS
What about the poison? Haven't you
traced that, at least?

DEXTER
Hardly. This house is a poisoner's
paradise. We found the stuff in
practically every room. And
unfortunately no one’s got a police
record. ‘Cept you, of course

He chuckles but Jennings freezes. His worst nightmares are made
flesh.

JENNINGS
What do you intend to do about it?

Dexter is genuinely surprised. He‘d only been joshing.

DEXTER
What? You mean — ? Nothing. What
should we do?

JENNINGS
Nothing?

DEXTER
Nah. I had a brother who was a
conscientious objector. He did a bit
of time, too. Why? Don’t they know?
Haven't you told them?

Jennings just looks at him.

DEXTER (CONT'D)
T should forget about it. The war’s
over. And you’re too old to fight in
another one. Right. Better be off.
‘Bye then, Mr Jennings.

He is gone. A huge, leaden weight slides off the butler’s
shoulders.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALL AND CORRIDOR. DAY.

George is carrying the Nesbitts’ cases down the stairs. They
follow, talking softly.

FREDDIE
You're a fool. Now what are we
supposed to do?

MABEL
Oh Freddie. Do try not to be so
frightened all the time.

They move off camera as Arthur, climbing the stairs, takes us up
to Barnes whe is carrying luggage down with Sarah. Behind them
are the Merediths.

ANTHONY
I don’t know.. I got to the door of the
library and then I just thought...
what‘s the point..? The truth is, I've
made rather a fool of myself

LAVINIA
Maybe... but you’re my fool.

She squeezes his arm as they turn into the entrance hall where
Jennings is seeing out the Nesbitts and Weissman is on the
telephone.

WEISSMAN
What do you mean the butler didn’t do
it? If he didn’t do it, then who the
hell did?

Jennings, both wounded and mortally offended by this, holds the
door for Anthony and Lavinia as the servants take out their
things.
WEISSMAN (CONT'D)
What? Are you sure? When? Check it and
call me in London.

Absently, he gives a smile to Jennings but the butler only
returns a hurt glare as Renee passes by.

INT. STOCKBRIDGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

Renee enters. Raymond stands by the window. Louisa reads a
newspaper. She looks up.

RENEE

do about the packing?Only you said
last night that you might be staying
on for a while...

Louisa does not answer but instead looks enquiringly at Raymond.

RAYMOND
It's not my decision.

LOUISA
On the contrary. It is entirely your
decision,

She holds his gaze. No arm wrestlers in a dock-side pub could be
more absorbed in their contest of wills. It is Raymond's
knuckles which hit the tables first.

RAYMOND
Very well.

LOUISA
Don't say it if you don't mean it.

RAYMOND e@

IZ do mean it...I won't mention the
subject again.

His capitulation is clear: He has purchased a scandal-free zone
at the cost of never challenging his wife again over the whole
William question, She is content.
LOUISA
Then thank you, yes, do pack. I'll be
leaving with his lordship after all.

that's true it's too long to wait. You
can do better.

Rupert opens his mouth to answer but before he can, Isobel steps
round the corner at the base of the staircase. She must have
heard. She looks carefully at Rupert.

ISOBEL
Have you checked your room? You
mustn’t leave anything behind

INT. ELSIE'S ATTIC ROOM. DAY

Elsie lies stretched out on her bed, reading a film magazine.
She is smoking. The door opens. It is Mrs Wilson. Elsie glances
over and then back to her magazine.

MRS WILSON
You know smoking up here is strictly
forbidden.

Elsie takes a long, deep drag on her cigarette and blows a smoke
ring.

MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
The other guests aren’t leaving by
train so the luggage car can run you
to the station. You'll find it outside
the front.

ELSIE
And that’s it?

MRS WILSON
Let us know where you would like your
reference to be sent.

She is about to go as Elsie stands.
ELSIE
I didn’t mean nothing to him, you

know. It was never serious...

MRS WILSON

136 EXT. GOSFORD PARK. DAY.

George and Arthur are loading the last things into Jeremy's
roadster. Off screen, the two young men and Isobel loiter by the
vehicle.

ISOBEL (VO)
No, I shouldn’t think of it. I know
how your father hates it when
someone's been in the papers and I'm
afraid I’m bound to be.

RUPERT (VO)
What about January? When things have
cooled off a bit.

The footmen come round to open the doors making them visible.

Before Rupert can answer, she has gone, across the gravel, @
towards the house.

JEREMY
That was pretty painless.

RUPERT
No it wasn't.

In answer to Jeremy’s curious stare, Rupert follows Isobel with
his eyes.

RUPERT (CONT'D)
Not for me, anyway.

Amazing as it would be to Isobel, Rupert is in love with her.
But it will do no good for she will never believe him now. With
a sigh, he climbs into the car and starts it up.

137 INT. HALL/EXT. GOSFORD PARK. DAY.

As Jennings waits by the door, Weissman and Ivor cross the hall,
dressed for travel.

IVOR
Why? What’s happened?

WEISSMAN
They've brought in Sidney Kent as the
new President of the Studio. He likes
the Chan series and he’s over-ruled
Sheehan. The deadline’s been dropped

and I can cast whomever I like. Panic
over.

IVOR
Just like that? What a weird and
savage world you Live in.

They have come out through the front door. Henry is already in
their car. Pip sits alone and unloved on the steps watching as,
at the far side of the house, Elsie’s case is being put into one
of the estate vehicles. Mary is with her

MARY
Good luck. Don't do anything I
wouldn't do.

ELSIE
Well, at least I know now that gives
me some room for manocevre.

ro

To their surprise, Weissman hails her from across the forecourt

WEISSMAN
Hey! You there! Where are you going?

ELSIE
To the station.

WEISSMAN
Do you want a ride to London?

When she compares the battered farm car to the gleaming lagonda,
the choice is easy.

ELSIE
Sure. Why not?

With a laugh, she siezes her case and runs to the car. As she
climbs in she is distracted for a moment. The head of the
unloved Pip makes a brief appearance from the top of her hold-
all. Firmly, she pushes him back and climbs into the car. Ivor
turns to see a look of disapproval on Jennings’s face, though he
can't know if he saw the dog. Maybe he did.

IVOR

creature deserve a second chance?

138 INT, TRENTHAM BEDROOM. DAY.

Mary is putting the last things in the suitcase, each carefully
encased in a layer of tissue paper with crushed tissue to ease
the folds. Constance is in travelling clothes. She addresses two
envelopes, seals them and leaves them on the dressing-table.

CONSTANCE
Honestly, it's getting so expensive.
By the time one does Jennings, and
leaves something for the housemaids,
one might as well have taken a suite
at the Ritz. Tell me, what happened to
William’s little maid. I never saw her
again after that dinner.

MARY
She’s gone.

CONSTANCE
Pity really. I should have thought it
was a good idea to have someone in the
house who's actually sorry he’s dead. @

Sylvia looks round the door. If she heard she doesn’t show it.
Or, possibly, care.

CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
There you are, dear. Did you have a
nice ride?

SYLVIA
i feel rather guilty. Apparently
they've all gone. Except for you and
Louisa.. but there’s no hurry. Why not
stay for luncheon?

CONSTANCE
T’d better be off. Leave you in peace.

Sylvia, once more in jodphurs, sits on the bed near where Mary
is packing, idly fingering a garment that is waiting to go in
the case. Constance is applying lipstick.

CONSTANCE (CONT'D)

Now you will telephone with the
funeral plans?

SYLVIA e
You don’t have to come if it’s a bore.

CONSTANCE
Nonsense. Of course I'm coming... Have
you decided what you're going to do?

SYLVIA
Not really. I thought I might travel
for a bit.. Amelia Northbrook rang up
this morning. They’ve taken a house in
Alexandria for the winter and she’s
given me an open invitation...

CONSTANCE
That sounds lovely... and what about
Gosford?

Sylvia shrugs, holding a scarf against herself to test the
colour.

SYLVIA
I don’t know., William loved it, of
course. Fiddling with his guns...
Tramping over his acres... not killing
his pheasants.. Poor William.

She finds another scarf better suited to her colouring.
Constance nods, carefully patting her lipstick dry with a
handkerchief she keeps for that purpose.

CONSTANCE
Yes. Poor, dear William. We shall miss
him.. So will you keep the place going,
then?

SYLVIA
It's so difficult.. I mean, these days,
does one want the bother? It’s not a
family house, after all. Just bought
with William’s ill-gotten gains. I
suppose I could shut it up for now and
then make a decision when my head
stops spinning.

CONSTANCE,
Mrs Wilson can manage things until
you're ready.

SYLVIA
Oh yes, she could manage things. Let's
not worry about that.. No doubt she’1l
sieze the chance to get rid of the
wretched Mrs Croft.

CONSTANCE
Why are they such enemies?

SYLVIA

Who knows? Something to do with when
they were both in one of William's
sweat shops. Mrs Croft was the senior
then. She was a cook when Mrs Wilson
was a lowly factory worker. Now she’s
gone up in the world and Mrs Croft
can't adjust. Usual rubbish...

CONSTANCE
Was there ever a Mister Wilson? I
Can't imagine it.

SYLVIA
Nor me. Although, funnily enough, I
think there must have been.

CONSTANCE
Really? You amaze me.

SYLVIA
Well, unless she just changed her
name...I know she had a different one
when she first worked for William.
Parker or Parkis or something.

A missing piece has fallen into place for Mary. She shuts the
case and stands.

MARY

bags.
INT. MRS WILSON’S ROOM. DAY.

Mrs Wilson is making notes in a linen book. She puts down her
pen.

Mrs Wilson stands and strolls over to the window, watching the
activity outside.

MARY (CONT'D)
How did you know it was him? Was it
the name? Or did you see the
photograph in his room?

MRS WILSON
Ah. The photograph... What a miracle it
survived...His mother put it in his
blanket...She just wanted to feel he
had something of hers, I
suppose...What does he think happened

to her?

MARY
They said she died. Just after he was
born.

MRS WILSON

Well she didn't die. She gave him up.
He promised the boy would be adopted.
Said he knew the family. Turns out we
all clung to that dream - all us
girls. A better chance in life for our
children and all the time he was
dumping them - his children - in some
godforsaken place ~- and I believed
him. Maybe it was easier that way. My
sister has always hated me for it.

MARY
Your sister?

MRS WILSON
Mrs Croft. Didn't you know? She kept
hers - not many did, and it was very
hard for her. She lost her job and
then he died anyway - Scarlet Fever.

so the food is waiting. I know when
they will be tired so the bed is made

MRS WILSON
Why would I? What purpose could it

They can never touch him, That's

Won’t we, Raymond?

She glances at her husband. She is prepared to live in peace if
he is.

Nearby stands Constance’s car. Merriman puts in the luggage
Mary comes out, with dressing case and valise, as the
Stockbridges get in. Robert strolls over as Renee tucks in
Louisa and climbs into the front seat. The rear dicky is waiting
for Robert.

MARY
Goodbye then.

ROBERT
Goodbye.

She hesitates, trying to think of what to say, but he touches
her cheek.

ROBERT (CONT’D)
It’s all right.. It's over. It’s
finished.

Raymond opens his car door impatiently.

RAYMOND
Parks, for heaven's sake, can we get
started?

With a smile, Robert crosses to the car, jumps in and they are
away with Sylvia waving them off. As Mary walks over to give
Merriman her valise, she sees Mrs Wilson’s face, pressed against
the basement window watching the dark head in the dicky as it
moves off down the drive. Merriman takes the case and straps it
on.

MERRIMAN

She kisses her niece and climbs into the car. Mary leans in and
straightens the rug on Constance’s knees, finds the basket with
the thermos and sandwich box and places it nearby. Clearly
while, in one way, everything has changed, in another, nothing
has.

Mary climbs in and with a wave to Sylvia, the car moves off.

CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
Heavens, what a relief to be going.
It'll take me a month to recover.

141 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL. DAY.

Mrs Wilson is on her way past the servants’ hall when she
catches sight of Dorothy.

DOROTHY
Have they gone?

MRS WILSON r )

Yes. I’1l ask her ladyship if we’re to
lay luncheon in the dining-room. She
may want a tray upstairs.

Dorothy nods but Mrs Wilson hasn’t quite finished. She lowers
her voice.

MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
Thank you for your help last night,
Dorothy.

DOROTHY
You don’t have to thank me. You know
I'd kill for him if I had to.

This naked exposure of feeling is rather more than Mrs Wilson
bargained for. She recoils slightly and, in doing so, moves
until she can see into the servants’ hall. George, Arthur and
several others, headed by Mrs Croft, are sitting, doing various
tasks. One by one they look up at the house-keeper but Mrs Croft
is their spokesman.

INT. CONSTANCE’S CAR. DAY.

Constance has relaxed a little. She winds down the window that
divides her own seat from the two servants and speaks to the
maid.

CONSTANCE
Mary, do you suppose, if there’s a
trial, I’d have to testify? Or you? I
do hope not. I can’t think of anything
worse. Imagine a man being hanged
because of something one said in a
courtroom...

Mary looks at the countryside flashing by, thinking for a
moment.

MARY
I know... and what purpose could it
possibly serve?

Constance looks at her maid curiously for a moment before she
winds up the window.

As the final credits roll, Constance picks up the thermos from
the seat beside her and feebly tries to open it. Once again, she
fails and reaches for the speaking tube. But this time, instead,
she replaces the tube and tries the top of the thermos again.
With the tiniest bit of effort she opens it, pours herself a
drink and, with something like a sense of achievement, she sits
back. Perhaps things have altered, after all. Just a little.
