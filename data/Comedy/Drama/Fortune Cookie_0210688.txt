INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON

Fresh flowers are delivered to the loading dock of an upscale
Chinese restaurant. Hands pick up a tub of long-stemmed,
white flowers and ferry them through a kitchen where food
preparation has begun. Vegetables are chopped. Woks are taken
down off hooks. Ducks get stuffed, etc. The hands move
through swinging kitchen doors and into an elegant dining
room. A slender vase sits in the middle of a plain white
tablecloth. The hands insert three of the flowers in the
vase, removing offending leaves and fluffing up the
arrangement. The camera retreats to reveal a dining room full
of similarly accoutred tables and satisfied restaurant
manager HUE LING.

HUE returns through the kitchen doors and picks up a tray of
pre-cut fortune cookie dough. He holds the tray over his head
as he, again, navigates the kitchen. He sets it down in front
of a frazzled twenty-something-year-old non-Asian, GARRETT
HENRY.

HUE
No more fortunes with the word "suckle"
in them.

GARRETT
What?

HUE

A customer last night brought me his
wife's fortune and it had the word
"suckle" in it.

GARRETT
Do you remember how it was used?

HUE
I don't care how it was used! No more
suckle.

GARRETT

It's another word for nourish, you know.

HUE
Then use "nourish," just no more suckle,
«Suckling, «may one day suckle.

GARRETT
Bisuckle?

MR. HUE wags a warning finger at GARRETT who takes a black
felt tip pen and adds the word suckle to a list that includes
the words "dictator," "sponge," and "yankee."

INT. TRENT KENNEDY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Casually-dressed TRENT KENNEDY enters his living room
carrying mail. The home avoids usual bachelor trappings.
There are no Ferrari Poster or dishes piled in sink, etc. An
entire wall is lined with full bookshelves, but miscellaneous
books are strewn about as well.

TRENT pushes play on his answering machine. He enters his
kitchen and approaches a crib. We can't see who/what he's
talking to.

TRENT
Hey little guy. Still illin'?

WOMAN'S VOICE
Hey Trent. This is Teresa. God, this is
embarrassing, but I think I left a pair
of earrings over there last weekend.
Anyway, they sort of go with what I'm
wearing tonight, and I was wondering if
maybe--if you're not going to be there--
if you could leave them out in your
mailbox. I can just run by and pick them
up later. ..0r whatever.

TRENT walks back into his bedroom and pulls out the drawer of
his night stand. He opens a cigar box revealing condoms, a
dozen earrings, and a couple watches.

TRENT
Shit.

TRENT rifles through the box while a second message plays.

MAN'S VOICE
This is Kevin--Kevin from the Black
Hearted Irish. I was wondering if you
were going to play that single I sent you
on your show anytime soon? Give me a
call.

The third message is again TERESA.

WOMAN'S VOICE
They're green. And dangly.

Relieved, TRENT pulls the correct pair of earrings out of the
box. He grabs an envelope off his desk and seals the earrings
inside.

INT. PATTERSON KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Seventeen-year-old HEATH PATTERSON inserts a compact disk
into a jambox. The Jackson Five's "I'll Be There" purrs out
of the speakers. Arms outstretched, he performs a cornball
waltz towards his sister, twenty-three-year-old BETH
PATTERSON. She laughs.

BETH
They won't really play this, will they?

HEATH
I want to be prepared for anything.

BETH grabs her brother's hands and places them on her hips.
Then she puts her hands on his shoulders. She leads them into
a slow dance shuffle.

HEATH (CONT'D)
So this is it? This is simple!

BETH
I'm leading.

HEATH
So? I don't have a problem with that. She
can lead.

BETH
She might expect you to. Here. I'm going
to stop, and you take over.

After an awkward moment, the two resume the dance.

HEATH
This isn't too hard.

BETH
Remember, there is a beat.

HEATH works to find the beat.

HEATH
You may not realize this, but we kids
today--what with the decline in family
values and all--dance a bit closer than
this.

BETH

We're doing what is commonly known among
the female sex as type four dancing.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 4.

3 CONTINUED:
HEATH
Ah, type four. Maybe I should be taking
notes.
BETH

Perhaps. Notice the signs. We could fit a
third person between us. My hands rest
lightly and significantly above your hip
bone. I'm staring not at you, but at the
cute basketball player across the dance
floor.

HEATH
And type four dancing represents?

BETH
Utter disinterest.

HEATH
Show me type three.

BETH moves in closer to her brother.

BETH
OK, type three. Friendlier. Room to chat
without bumping noses, but the invisible
wall is still there. She's reserving
judgement, but you've got her attention.

HEATH
I'd take type three.

BETH
Who is this girl anyway?

HEATH
A sublime beauty. A goddess. Poetry in a
supermodel's body. Her name's Doug.

BETH
That's poetic.

HEATH
Ann Douglas, but everyone calls her Doug.

BETH
And I assume she's been making a fool of
herself pursuing you.

HEATH
It's been embarrassing, really.

The two dance for a moment in silence.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 5.
3 CONTINUED:

HEATH (CONT'D)

The truth is, I'm not sure she knew my
name before I asked her out. She's in my
trig class.

BETH
Pretty gutsy.

HEATH
Show me type two.

BETH closes in on HEATH, eliminating the gap between them.

HEATH (CONT'D)

(feigning disgust)
Your things--they're touching me. Hey!
Hey! Hey! Watch the hands, sister!

BETH
(ignoring him)
Here's where you'll want to slide your
hands down to the middle of her back.
Unless they're sweaty. If they're sweaty,
put ‘em on her hips ..on her jeans where
she won't notice.

HEATH
Is this where the sweet nothings come in?

BETH
Whoa, Tiger. We don't even have the
training wheels off yet. So what made
this girl say yes if she didn't know who
you were?

HEATH
Boatloads of charm. Plus, and probably
more importantly, she just gut publicly
dumped by a jock of some renown

BETH
And like a circling buzzard, my brother...

HEATH
.Swooped down on the carcass.

BETH
A class act.

The pair type-two dances for a few more seconds.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 6.
3 CONTINUED:

HEATH
Okay, this is starting to creep me out. I
think I've got it.

They separate and plop down in chairs.

BETH
Well let's hope she doesn't expect to be
dipped.

HEATH

Let's hope. So what are your plans for
this glorious Friday night? You think
they might tie up all the loose ends on
The X Files.

BETH
Uh, I have a date.

HEATH
Our long national nightmare is over. Who
is he?

BETH

His name is Trent. He works at that radio
station you and all your little skinhead
buddies listen to.

HEATH
If you insist on labeling us--we're
"alternative." Oh wait a minute. I don't
believe it. My sister has a date with
Trent "The Dead" Kennedy.

BETH
I do?

HEATH
I think Mom and Dad should know about
this.

BETH

He seemed nice.

HEATH
How'd you meet him?

BETH
He's in my book club.

HEATH

can read. We can put that in the plus

BETH
It probably won't amount to anything.

HEATH
(baiting his sister)
He's no Daniel, hunh?

BETH
Lay off, Heath.

HEATH
Well, I'm sorry, but as cool as Daniel
was, the dude's gone. He made his
decision. I say it's time to get over it.

BETH
If I ever see Daniel again, I'll tell him
it's over between the two of you.

EXT. JAMES MADISON HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

A line of expensive looking cars wait in a circular drive
next to a gymnasium. CAROLYN DOUGLAS, sitting behind the
steering wheel of the one clunker in the row, reads Fortune
Magazine as she waits for her daughter DOUG. A group of pom
pom carrying girls approach the cars. They tell each other
goodbye or, alternately, "see you tonight." DOUG gets in the
clunker.

INT. DOUGLAS CLUNKER - AFTERNOON

Still engrossed in the article, CAROLYN absently starts the

We were making one of those giant

they experiment on in biology lab? Well
he was the top of the pyramid.

CAROLYN
(absently)
Yeah?

DOUG
Yeah? Anyway, I was supposed to be
spotting, but I realized that I hadn't
painted my nails, so I wandered over to
my purse to get the polish--I saw no
option--and then I heard this thud
followed by all these manic cheerleaders
screaming.

CAROLYN
(still engrossed in magazine)
Uh huh...
DOUG

I ran back to where I was supposed to be
standing, and there was James laying ina
pool of blood, staring up, his eyes still
open. He looked like that picture in our
history book of Robert Kennedy after he
had been assassinated.

DOUG poses briefly like Robert Kennedy on the floor of the
Ambassador Hotel. CAROLYN starts the car, and begins to pull
out of the lot.
CAROLYN
Blockbuster stock is up again.
DOUG
No kidding.
CAROLYN

They're the fastest growing franchise in
America.

7 INT. JEWELRY STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

Nervous forty-year-old DEAN JEFFRIES stares at engagement
rings through a glass case. A humorless and matronly SALES
CLERK waddles over.

SALES CLERK
Is there anything you'd like to take a
closer look at sir?

DEAN
Uh, that one.

The SALES CLERK withdraws the ring from the case and hands it
to DEAN. DEAN examines the dangling price tag. A look of
concern passes across his face.

SALES CLERK
Three months salary is the rule of thumb
sir.

DEAN
What?

SALES CLERK
For how much you should spend, that is.

DEAN
Who do you suppose came up with that
rule?

SALES CLERK
Sir?

DEAN
Well--and this is only a theory--but I
suspect that whoever decided that three
month's salary was the rule was sitting
on your side of the counter.

invented Secretaries Day.
SALES CLERK
No, those were the flower shop people. We
had nothing to do with that.
DEAN laughs. The SALES CLERK still refuses to smile.

DEAN
I have a question.

The SALES CLERK stares at DEAN who remains uncomfortable.

DEAN (CONT'D)
Can you return them?

SALES CLERK
Within seventy two hours.

DEAN
Um.. Do you.. I mean... Is there...

SALES CLERK
No questions asked, sir.

DEAN
Do people laugh? Point and stare?

SALES CLERK
Not until you've left the premises.

DEAN continues to study the ring.

DEAN
I'll take it.

SALES CLERK
Will that be cash or credit?

DEAN
I'll be using my first born.

SALES CLERK
I'll find a fancy box.

EXT. STRIP CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

Camera reveals an expansive and pristine Blockbuster Video

INT. LES VIDEO - LATE AFTERNOON

CAROLYN stands behind the counter while DOUG shelves videos
in the tiny store.

DOUG
The Unbearable Lightness of Being. It was
about Czechoslovakia, but it was made in
England.

CAROLYN
True.

DOUG
Thanks, but where does it go.

CAROLYN
In the Daniel Day Lewis section.

DOUG
Oh. You realize this is the reason that
in the history of civilization no one has
ever been able to find a movie at a video
store without asking. I think we should
start a trend. Let's just alphabetize
every last one of them. No more
subdividing by category, by country, by
star, by director. Every movie in it's
place.

CAROLYN
Most people don't come in looking for a
particular film. Most come in and browse.
They like all the comedies being
together. They like all the subtitled
films together. There's an article in
Video Entrepreneur that explains the
strategy if you want to read about it.

DOUG
(sarcastically)
The new issue of Video Entrepreneur came
in and you didn't tell me?

CAROLYN

I was saving it for a special occasion.
Your birthday isn't far off.

DOUG

You've been going out, what, a year?
CAROLYN

To the day.
DOUG

Well I want to know what his intentions
are. He's a great guy. You're crazy about
him. I'm tired of you two having to sneak
around behind my back. I don't see what
the hold up is here.

CAROLYN
Honey, there are things you don't know
about Dean.

DOUG
He's a vampire, a bloodsucking prince of
darkness. I had a feeling he was too good
to be true.

CAROLYN
And that's not even that bad part, honey.
The thing is.. The thing is..

DOUG
The thing is...

CAROLYN
The thing is that it's none of your
business, but just know that Dean is
understandably a little gun-shy when it
comes to marriage.

DOUG
And how do you feel about it?

CAROLYN
I can think of worse things, but I'm not
going to let Dean know that. I'm sure it
would scare him to death.

Yes, and speaking of which, don't you

DOUG
Don't remind me.

CAROLYN
Not looking forward to it?

DOUG
I think I'm going to call him and tell
him I can't go. Help me think of
something. Hey, you said you wanted to
start staying open late. Let's start
tonight. I'll work.

CAROLYN
You don't like this boy you're going
with?

DOUG

I don't know him. I don't know why he
asked me. I was just too shocked to think
of anything to say except yes. God,
everybody in school knows I'm single, and
Troy's already asked a freshman--A
FRESHMAN--to the dance. Most of the
time, if I have a clue somebody likes me
who I don't want to go out with, I can
manage to avoid being alone with him, or
I'll already have an excuse--a good one--
just right there, ready, you know. At the
tip of my tongue. This guy tricked me. He
gave none of the usual preliminary signs.

CAROLYN
The usual signs?

DOUG
Stuttering. Shortness of breath.
Describing his car stereo.

CAROLYN
Is he cute?

DOUG
That's the thing: I've never noticed.

He's probably already rented a tux.

Probably white. Probably with tails and a
top hat. A pink cummerbund.

CAROLYN
You know we used to think of dating as a
chance to get to know people.

DOUG
You and Betty and Wilma?

CAROLYN
You know I met your father on a blind
date.

DOUG
That settles it. I'm staying home.

CAROLYN
I think you should go.

DOUG
I'll make you a deal.

CAROLYN
I'm listening.

DOUG
I'll go, but you've got to promise to
snatch that corsage out of his hand right
off. Otherwise I'll end up bleeding and
felt up before I'm even out of the house.

CAROLYN
And you promise not to run up and hug
Dean and call him Daddy?

DOUG
You gotta learn to take a joke, Mom.

GARRETT
The notice in the English grad student
lounge said "Creative Writers Needed
Bad," and of course, someone had added
"Competent Grammarian Needed Worser"
below that. When I saw it, I couldn't
figure out what a Chinese Restaurant
would need a "creative writer" for, but I
needed a job. Mr. Hue told me the
concept. He wanted someone who would
write fortunes. You know..for the fortune
cookies. No two, he said, could ever be
the same. He didn't want any that said,
"Confucious say, yadda yadda." He didn't
want them pulled out of quotation books.
And they had to be handwritten. He told
me to give him one on the spot. I said,
"Nine dollars an hour is a small price to
pay for piece of mind." So I got the job.
I try to be philosophical about it. I
figure in the literary hierarchy, what I
do comes somewhere between being the
lyricist for Bryan Adams and writing
street signs. Some of those street signs
are brilliant by the way. I saw one once
that said, "Men Laying Pipe Beware." I
would have signed my name to that one.

INT. TRENT'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 11

TRENT sits in front of his high tech stereo system. He has
several CDs laid out in front of him: Van Morrison, Terrence
Trent D'arby, Elvis Costello, Bob Marley, etc. He humms "I'm
in the mood for love" as he refers to the song listings on
the CDs and programs in appropriate mood music. He adjusts
the volume to a level that's been marked on the amplifier. As
he pushes the final two buttons on the CD player, he speaks.

out of the refrigerator, sniffs it, then dumps it out. Again

TRENT sits in the DJ booth at an alternative rock station.
Something grungy buzzes out of the earphones hanging around

his neck.

TRENT
There was this time--I think I was 16--
that I got asked to one of those Sadie
Hawkins dances by this girl I didn't
really know, but I said yes because, you
know, I didn't want to be a dick.
Technically, the girl is supposed to pick
you up, but she didn't have a car and she
lived like a thousand miles outside of
town, so I drove out to get her. The
first thing I do when I get there is lock
my keys in the car. As if that's not
enough, the motor's running, her parents
have left for the evening, and my Dad's

sledding on a big hill near her house
which is a blast. You know how you have
to hold on to each other, and we're
screaming and laughing. We're out there
living some sort of Norman Rockwell
painting, and I'm thinking, "Gee, this
girl is swell." Our fourth or fifth time
down the hill, we slide into this huge
pile of slush. When her parents get home,
I'm standing in front of the fireplace in
nothing but her Dad's bathrobe and a
smile. But the Dad is cool. He's like,
"Could I get you my slippers, Son?" I
think that was the last time I had a good
time on a date. Before it became a
science. God, I can't even remember if I
kissed her.

EXT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 30

TRENT arrives at BETH'S door. Dressed sharply, he carries a
single rose. He knocks. BETH answers. AMANDA remains on the
couch facing both the TV and the door.

TRENT
Hi. You ready?

BETH
(concerned)
I don't look ready?

TRENT
No, I mean yeah, you look ready. It was
rhetorical..sort of. I guess I meant are
you available to leave?

AMANDA
A flying start.

BETH
Yeah, let's go.

TRENT
(holding out rose)
This is for you.

BETH
Thanks.

BETH holds the flower self-consciously trying to decide

whether she should carry it or leave it in a vase. TRENT
notices.

BETH and TRENT, both horrified, turn and gape at AMANDA.

BETH
Thank you, Miss Manners.

AMANDA
Just thought you should know.

INT. DOUGLAS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 31

HEATH fidgets in the living room. CAROLYN puts on her own
shoes as she tries to stall for her daughter.

CAROLYN
Ann says the two of you have math
together.

HEATH

Trig--and boy does it come in handy.

There's a pause while CAROLYN decides whether HEATH is being
intentionally funny.

CAROLYN
Ann says those college prep course are
difficult.

HEATH

Pretty tough.
A moment of awkward silence.

CAROLYN
So what are your plans?

HEATH
Well, after graduation, I think I want to
go to a four-year school, you know, study
art, maybe go into animation.

CAROLYN
Uh, I'll need Ann home before that.

Fortune Cookie - 24.

HEATH
Sorry. You mean tonight. Dinner before
the dance at Louie's On The Lake. A bunch
of friends of mine are eating there. Then
I was going to take her to this coffee
shop down by the university. They've got
one of my pieces on display there. I
don't know. You think that would look
like showing off?

CAROLYN
I'm not sure what...

CAROLYN stops speaking when she sees HEATH'S jaw drop. Behind
her DOUG has entered the room looking stunning. HEATH stands
up. He's holding the corsage box in his trembling hand.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Would you like some help with that,
Heath?

HEATH hands the box off to CAROLYN without taking his eyes
off DOUG.

DOUG
Hi, sorry I'm running late.
HEATH
These aren't the socks I wanted to wear.
DOUG
What?
CAROLYN
Oh, what do you know? This is a wrist
corsage.

CAROLYN helps DOUG on with the corsage while HEATH fidgets.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Now, Ann, I want you home no later than...

DOUG mouths the word "early" to her mother.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
midnight.

DOUG
Oh, mom.

CAROLYN

Midnight, and I mean it. I need you to
inventory the store in the morning.

CAROLYN works the group towards the door.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Nice meeting you, Heath.

HEATH
Thanks, you too.

CAROLYN
I think she'd like to see your work.

DOUG
See his what?

CAROLYN closes the door on the couple.
32 EXT. DOUGLAS HOUSE - NIGHT

As HEATH and DOUG stroll up the sidewalk, DEAN pulls up in
front of the house.

DOUG
Hey, Dean!

DEAN
Hey, Kiddo. Bowling tonight?

DOUG
Tractor pull.

Unintroduced, HEATH stands uncomfortably.

DEAN
Is your mom ready?

DOUG
For a hostile takeover, yes. For a date?
Who knows.

DEAN
Actually, with our dates, it's tough to
tell the difference.
DOUG

I don't want to hear about it.
DOUG finally remembers HEATH.

HEATH laughs nervously.

DOUG

HEATH

Trig.
DEAN

Maybe you'll be able to get some homework
done tonight.

DEAN reaches out to shake Heath's hand. When he does, the
ring box falls out of the jacket he's carrying. He stuffs it
back in his pocket quickly, but not before DOUG notices.

DEAN (CONT'D)
(upon box retrieval, shaking
Heath's hand)
Sorry about that. Never know when you're
going to need that spare glass eye. Good
to meet you.

HEATH
Uh, yeah.

DOUG
We better go. Mom gives him demerits for
tardiness. See ya, Dean.
DOUG leads HEATH away.
DEAN
(calling after them)
Have fun.
DEAN knocks on the door while opening it up.
INT. DOUGLAS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 33
DEAN enters the house.

DEAN
Hi, honey. I'm home.

DEAN plops down on the couch and kicks his feet up on an

ottoman. CAROLYN enters room with a cordless phone pressed to
her ear. She nods at DEAN, but continues the conversation.

shop which is where you should be anyway.
You promised me those VCRs last week.

DEAN
Big day at the office.

CAROLYN
I rent them. You fix them. It works
better that way.

DEAN
Naw, you wouldn't want to hear about it.

CAROLYN
Well where are the parts coming from? The
eighteenth century? We have this thing
now. It's called next-day delivery?

DEAN
Okay, Okay. They want me to head up the
new software division.

CAROLYN
No they don't use ponies anymore.

DEAN
And, from what I understand, San
Francisco is a beautiful city.

CAROLYN
Can I get that in blood?

DEAN
Good weather. Fancy rice dishes.

CAROLYN
Always a pleasure, Mr. Willis.

DEAN
Great restaurants.

CAROLYN clicks the phone off emphatically.

CAROLYN
What about great restaurants?

DEAN
We're going to one. You ready?
Fortune Cookie - 28.

34 INT. TRENT'S CAR - NIGHT 34

TRENT and BETH drive to the restaurant.

TRENT
It's called The Empire. Have you heard of
it?

BETH
No.

TRENT

I've just been a couple times. Food's
great. Service is unbelievable. And they
have this thing.

BETH
This thing?

TRENT
This thing they do. They handwrite your
fortunes in the fortune cookies. Last
time I went the ink was still wet.

BETH
That's hygienic. Do you remember what it
said?

TRENT

Clearly. It said, "Risk your heart
without fear. Loneness gone. Romance

near."
BETH
And was it?
TRENT

Real near. The guy one table over from me
was performing a non-surgical
tonsillectomy on his date.

BETH
God, I hate that.

TRENT
Yeah.

BETH

It said "loneness"--not loneliness?

TRENT
That's what made me remember it.

loneliness is bad--we can all agree on
that--but I'm not sure "loneness" is.

TRENT
It's like people think that if you're
alone, you're automatically unhappy.

BETH
I'm very content by myself.

TRENT
Same here.

INT. HEATH'S CAR - NIGHT 35
DOUG and HEATH ride in Heath's car in uncomfortable silence.
DOUG
Hey, what do you think about eating at
The Empire?
HEATH
(hesitating)
Sounds fine.

DOUG
Did you already have plans?

HEATH
No, not really.

The pair returns to the uncomfortable silence.

HEATH (CONT'D)
Mr. Jeffries coached me in Little League.

DOUG
Dean? He didn't remember you?

HEATH
I was seven at the time. I think he might
have if I would have sat next to him and
yelled, "Hey batter, batter, batter,
batter, swwwwwwing"

Again with the silence.

HEATH (CONT'D)
Don't you hate Mrs. Shropshire?

HEATH

No.
DOUG

Civics?
HEATH

(uneasily)

No.
DOUG

Have you ever had her for a class?
HEATH

No.
DOUG

So why do you hate her?

HEATH
I've just heard, you know, people say
things that, I guess, umm, make me hate

her.
DOUG
Oh.
HEATH
The food in the cafeteria--that's really
bad too.
DOUG

I've never had any.

HEATH
Well, I don't recommend it.

More uncomfortable silence.
HEATH (CONT'D)
I don't think the Beatles were all that

DOUG looks quizzically at HEATH.

CAROLYN
You know what. Did anything special
happen down at the accounting firm of
Ross and Harvey today?

DEAN
Oh. You mean the stripper who came in and
sang happy anniversary to me in the
middle of a staff meeting.

CAROLYN
It wasn't a stripper. It was a man ina
gorilla suit.

DEAN
Boy, I sure wasted a lot of dollar bills,
then. And, once again, you one-upped me.

CAROLYN
The flowers you sent were lovely.

DEAN rests his head on CAROLYN'S shoulder as she drives.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
And I did not one-up you.

CAROLYN wraps her arm around Dean's shoulder.

DEAN
Honey, that light was red.

CAROLYN
No it wasn't.

INT. THE EMPIRE KITCHEN - NIGHT 37
The restaurant is operating at full-tilt now. The kitchen is

a buzz of activity. An impatient waiter, JOHN LU, speaks

above the din to GARRETT who is up to his elbows in strips of
paper, cookies and ink.

LU
Table seventeen. Conventioneers.

GARRETT
Reduce them to stereotypes for me.

LU
"Conventioneers" isn't enough?

GARRETT shakes his head no.

LU (CONT'D)

(sighing)
All right. The man sent the first bottle
of wine back. He said the nose was too
herbal.

GARRETT
Enough said. The date?

GARRETT begins scribbling down the first fortune.

LU
The woman is artificially tan, except for
mysterious pale band on ring finger of
left hand.

GARRET
Charlie Chan!

LU
I see number one son impressed.

GARRETT
For the lady.

GARRETT hands LU first fortune.
LU

Stop and smell the poseurs.

GARRETT
And for the gentleman...

Reading second one as he writes it.
Sometimes ..cheaters ..win. Mostly ..they
wend up ..like ..the ..couple ..in ..the
Towering ..Inferno. There. That should
make for an interesting denouement.

GARRETT
Wisdom ain't pretty.

38 EXT. UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY 38
BETH is stretched out on the grass, a book bag nearby.

BETH
There are a number of horrors I prefer to
dating, balancing my checkbook, getting a
pap smear, watching Saturday Night Live.
First of all, I'm not very good at it.
Dating, that is. I always say the wrong
thing. I know you're supposed to act a
certain way, but I can never make myself
do it. You know, appearing entranced by
every detail of his life or being
impressed because he's in a band or owns
a boat.

39 INT. THE EMPIRE DINING ROOM - NIGHT 39
TRENT is talking to BETH over wine.

TRENT
We'll be live on air, and I'll take calls
off the request line,and I just know
these guys are already stoned. I do the
morning show. So it's like seven a.m.,
and I've got Jeff Spicoli calling into
ask me about radio. Not how to break into
the business, but how to fix them. "Yo,
Dead, there's too much distortion." And I
can hear it cranked in the background,
but you can't tell these guys to just
turn it down.

TRENT looks for encouragement from BETH, but she seems
uninterested.

BETH

TRENT
The strained metaphor game. The correct
answer is no, because I just made it up.

We're giving up on natural conversational
flow this early.

BETH looks at her watch and gives TRENT a playful expression
of concern.

TRENT
We're irrigating the conversation.
Replenishing it.

BETH
How do you play?
TRENT
I'm not sure. I just liked the title.
BETH
O.K.
TRENT

All right. I've got it. The first person
names two random items or concepts. The
second person has to complete the
strained metaphor.

BETH
Sounds challenging.

TRENT
No, the challenging version is the
precise metaphor game. It's in your best
interest not to confuse the two.

BETH
Can we play a sample round?

Sure. Let me think. O.K. First dates are

understand the game. So, onto round one.
How about a heart and an edible garnish.

BETH
Give me a second.

BETH drums her fingers on the table and thinks.

BETH (CONT'D)
Let's see, the human heart, like an
edible garnish, tempts the hungry who,
but then chew it up and, having tasted
its fruit--no make that essence--, spit
it out.

TRENT
Bonus points for extra strained. But I
think I can see a theme here.

BETH
You do, huh? Let's create a window into
your psyche.

Glancing around, BETH notices a snuggly couple at a nearby

table.

BETH (CONT'D)
How about love and ..The Empire.

TRENT
That's easy. Love is an empire that
conquers all.

BETH
Or that crumbles into dust?

TRENT
God, I feel like I'm on a date with the
walking wounded.

BETH
That's what Amanda--she's my roommate--

lie.

in love. I've heard he existed, but I
never thought I'd be going out to dinner
with him.

TRENT
I've been in love. Well, it felt like.. I
thought it was.. There was this girl who..
Jesus, I lived with a woman for three
years!

You've never been in love. You've never

BETH
Thought so.
TRENT
Do you think this somehow gives you more
soul.

Not soul, necessarily, but insight. Yeah.
TRENT
Don't confuse being cynical with having
insight.
BETH

I'm just saying, one of his spent a few
nights in Heartbreak Hotel, one of us

Hi.
BETH

Heath and Doug, this is Trent.

So what are you doing here? I thought all
your friends were going to Louie's.

40 INT. HEATH'S BEDROOM - DAY 40

HEATH is interviewed in his room. Various art projects
surround him.

HEATH
Just be yourself. Just be yourself.
Maybe, if yourself happens to be the bass

LU leans against the desk where Garrett is feverishly
working. There is a bulletin board above GARRETT'S work
station. On it, an extra large, Post It note-sized fortune is
tacked up. LU notices it while he's addressing Garrett. When
LU speaks in the kitchen, he has no accent.

intimate, confidential. Because I have a
general belief in the goodness of man.

LU

You are radiant and sublime.

GARRETT
You're robbing me of my innocence, Lu.

LU
If there's longing inside you, if it

GARRETT
I might as well take that job at the
nuclear plant.

LU
K, L, M, two, three, one, nine. Yep, I
think this could get you fired.

GARRETT
I haven't sent it out. I just saw this
woman in here once. This woman. More than

Now that's a woman.

GARRETT
Yeah. So if I ever see her in here again,
I'm risking it all.

43 INT. THE EMPIRE DINING ROOM - NIGHT 43

HEATH and DOUG look over the menus. DOUG has been positioned
so that she has to keep looking over her shoulder to see her
mother's table. She does this with annoying frequency.

DOUG
You wanna split the rib appetizer?

HEATH
Sounds good.

DOUG
Do you feel kind of stupid here? Dressed
like this? I'll bet everyone around us is
checking us out, and they're telling each
other about their own proms. We're like
this conversation piece saving everyone
who's trying to keep a conversation
going, don't you think?

HEATH
Yeah.

The two glance about a bit with this thought in mind.

DOUG
Wouldn't it be funny if I threw a glass
of water in your face and yelled, "With
my sister!? MY SISTER!?"

HEATH
Yeah.

HEATH glances around again, this time because he thinks
DOUG'S being a little loud. DOUG begins realizing she can
push HEATH around.

HEATH
Yeah.

DOUG
You wanna do it?

HEATH

(nervously)

Really?

DOUG
No.

LU approaches the table. When he's in the dining room, he
adopts a thick Chinese accent. He's extremely accommodating
to a customer's face. Less so, in the back.

LU
An appetizer to start?

DOUG waits for HEATH to order the appetizer they've decided
on, but he's in outer space. She orders with barely-hidden
annoyance.

DOUG
The ribs.

INT. LES VIDEO - DAY 44
CAROLYN stands behind the counter at Les Video.

CAROLYN
Well, the nice thing about dating someone
for a long time is that all that silly
stuff you go through at first--you know,
nervously laughing when you don't know if
something he says is supposed to be a
joke or fretting about the attempted good
night kiss--it's all behind you. No more
game playing. I can just tell what Dean

I'll say. But it's not a done deal yet.

CAROLYN

BETH

How so?

BETH

TRENT
So, if you're the broken heart expert,
tell me what it's like--this love thang.

Pat Metheney with you."

TRENT

Wait a minute. This is still the good

blip in time, it hits you. You feel
complete for the first time ever ..even
though you didn't know you were missing
anything. Every song on the radio becomes
"Ode to The Two of Us." You're not sure
if the planet has continued to spin

TRENT
Are we still in the good part?

BETH
Until one day, one of you wakes up and
decides it's not right. It's not perfect.
It's time to move on.

BETH stops abruptly and takes a drink of water.

I've heard something about swooning.

BETH
That's from lack of oxygen. Side-effect
of rushing in where angels fear to tread.

DOUG wears her cheerleading practice clothes.

DOUG
I think it took me until eighth grade to
completely figure out boys. Then, once I
had, I was embarrassed it took me that
long. I mean, they're that simple. What I
figured out was that, if you want one,
you make him the center of the universe.
Everything revolves around him. His day.
His football practice. The little bruise
on his elbow. The kind of car he wants to
drive someday. Then, during my sophomore
year--I think it was pretty soon after my
boyfriend at the time, Bobby Snowden,
missed my Dad's funeral because of an
Aerosmith concert--I decided I wanted the
world to revolve around me.

I meant it sounded good ..for you. If

We could have gotten something else.
HEATH

I don't really like Chinese food.
DOUG

Why did you say you wanted to come here?
HEATH

It's fine. Really. I can find something

DOUG is clearly exasperated.

DOUG

Look, could we trade seats?
HEATH

Um, yeah.
DOUG

Thanks.

The pair gets up and changes seats. The process is awkward.
All the dishes and glasses have to be traded as well. Once
the process is complete, it's clear that DOUG is looking over

DOUG
Dean's spare glass eye? I think it's
really a ring which means he's going to
pop the question to Mom tonight, and I
want to see her reaction if he does.

HEATH
Oh. What'll she say if he does?

DOUG
Yes. I'm almost positive.

HEATH
Not many people get to see one of their

HEATH
Do you get to see your real Dad much?

DOUG
Nope. He's dead.

DEAN
You know how, sometimes, something that
just starts as a little misunderstanding
gets repeated and changed so much, that
it becomes, like, a new reality. That's

from the same hometown, and I think we
invited everybody. I told Carolyn how
awful it is for someone to get stood up
at the alter. I guess it's the way I told
the story--she always assumed I was the

I know where I've met Doug's date.

CAROLYN

DEAN
But I know why I remember him now. I
mean, I've coached a lot of kids. But
there was this play, I don't think I'll
ever forget. Something you just don't see
in most lifetimes. We were in the
playoffs, and we were into extra innings.
We had a one run lead, but whoever we
were playing had runners at second and
third with two outs. Their batter hits a
line shot out to right. I figure the game
is over. That kid, Heath, he did have
some speed, but he couldn't catch a cold.
Anyway, he runs this fly ball down,
dives...

CAROLYN
Catches it, and you win the game? The
Rocky theme music plays.

DEAN
Well that's what it looked like from
where I was sitting. And from where the
ump was to, because he called the batter
out which meant we won. So everyone is
celebrating. The team is throwing their
hats in the air, and I spot Heath talking
to the umpire. The next thing I know,
we've lost the game.

CAROLYN
How?

DEAN
He's told the umpire that he trapped the
ball. He didn't catch it on the fly, so
the two runners scored.

CAROLYN
So you've always resented this kid?

he's got balls that big.

If that doesn't work, make fun of the

HEATH looks at TRENT with something approaching shock.

TRENT (CONT'D)

That's a joke. I tell you, though, it's
like an Olympic event. You get better the
more you practice.

HEATH
Sort of ironic, isn't it?

TRENT

Ironic? You are your sister's brother.

DOUG
I mean, do you just not like meat? Or do
you not believe in killing animals? Or
are you just into the health factor?

HEATH
None of those I guess. I used to eat
meat. I liked it fine. I just don't
anymore. I'm not really much of a
vegetarian either. I don't like
vegetables all that much.

DOUG
So what happened? Did you get locked in a
slaughterhouse or something?

HEATH
This is a really bad anecdote. Makes me
look stupid.

DOUG
What?
HEATH
I'll tell you, but you won't believe it.

It's because of my pen pal.

Mine was from Somalia. His name is Achmad
Housbhenni, and we still write every once

DOUG
Wow, really? And he convinced you to
become a vegetarian?

HEATH
It's not quite that simple. He's not even
a vegetarian. He just wrote to me a lot
about being hungry. All of his letters
were about meals he had or questions
about what I eat. After a while, I
started thinking about what I was eating
every time I put food into my mouth,
imagining how Achmed would be enjoying
this burrito more than me, or the poetry
he would write if he ever got his hands
on one Big Mac. I started reading about
the famine, what caused it, the relief
efforts, all that, and one of the things
they kept mentioning, one of the reasons
the U.S. couldn't export more grain, is
because we use it to feed livestock.

DOUG
Well, doesn't that balance out? Wouldn't
we be eating that grain if we weren't
eating those cows?

HEATH
Yes and no. See, it takes like three
times as much energy and land to produce
the same amount of food as meat as it
does food as grain, but in first world
countries, that doesn't seem to bother
anyone. We can afford it. In third world
countries, it's a different story.

DOUG

Forgive me. I'm still surprised.

Not that you can read, that you're well-

Sure. I was afraid to go outside, and
Meemaw didn't have a TV, or it was always

with the number that matched and that was
your partner.

DOUG
Yeah.

HEATH
Well, if one of us happened to luck out
and draw someone recognizably female and
then refused to trade, the football
players would threaten to dismember us.
So, even under this outwardly egalitarian
system, the bold and the beautiful still
always ended up together. There's only
one time I can remember that it didn't
play out like that. You ended up with
this dork who had grown six inches in
fourteen months. He could hardly stand
upright let alone swing to the left.
Anyway, some walking Coke machine tapped
this lucky fellow on the shoulder and
gave him a quick lesson on social
Darwinism. So this guy's already walking
back down to dance with Paleolithic

DOUG
I'll look in the paper for any openings
for absorbers.

HEATH
Well, there are travel writers, museum
guides.

DOUG

But that's not absorbing. That's the
opposite of absorbing--things going out
instead of things coming in.

HEATH
You're saying those would be a good jobs
for an exuder.

DOUG
Right.

HEATH
Hmmm. You're right, you don't have much
ambition.

DOUG

I told you. But it's not like I mind
working, you know--waiting tables,
dealing blackjack, bottlecapping at a
brewery.

HEATH
I don't think they do that any more.
Robots and all.

DOUG
I just have a more European way of
thinking about it. You know, where you
work to live rather than live to work

HEATH
Yeah, those whimsical Germans.

DOUG
No, like the Spanish or Italians. Work
for a couple hours in the morning. Take a
three hour lunch, maybe a nap. Sunbathe.
Come back to work for a couple hours in
the afternoon.

HEATH

Overthrow the fascist regime that's taken
power while you've been getting tan.

DOUG
You don't approve. You think I sound

HEATH
No, no. I think it sounds great. I hope
you're able to do it.

Lu approaches the table, but a customer scoots out his chair
causing the fortune cookies he's carrying for HEATH and DOUG
to pop into the air. He catches them without dropping them,
but it's obvious he no longer knows which cookie goes to
which diner.

HEATH (CONT'D)
Thank you.

DOUG
So what about you? Do you have ambition.

HEATH
(facetiously)
Oh, yeah, me? I'm going to make millions.
Swimming pools, movie stars...

DOUG
Doing what?
HEATH
I'm going to be an avant garde artist.
DOUG
Oh we are talking big bucks.
HEATH
You know what I hate, maybe more than
anything.
DOUG

Racism, poverty...

HEATH
Furniture stores that sell paintings.

DOUG
I was going to say that.

HEATH
Have you seen them. They set up those
fake little rooms. You've got your taupe
love seat. You've got your taupe coffee
table. Then, you've got some sorry fruit

See, you've got passion. I don't have
anything I'm passionate about.

HEATH
Don't even get me started on the stuff
they hang up in hotel rooms.

DOUG picks up her cookie.

DOUG
Do you know the deal with the fortune
cookies here?

HEATH
No.

DOUG
(adopting a very serious tone)
They always come true. No, just kidding.
But they are supposed to be original.
They write a new one for everyone who
comes in.

HEATH
Wow.

They both crack open their cookies.

DOUG
What does yours say?

HEATH
(reading)
Lyle Lovett, Billy Joel, Ric Ocasek--you
never know who's going to win a Grammy.

DOUG
That's just weird.
HEATH
Let's hear yours.
DOUG
(reading)

What do these things have in common:
lawnmower, revolving door, sap?

HEATH shrugs. DOUG shakes her head in wonder.

64 INT. THE EMPIRE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 64

The food in front of DEAN and CAROLYN is half-eaten and
getting cold.

DEAN
So let me get this straight. You don't
even think there's a point in trying it
out, seeing if we could make it work. I
don't think that's fair.

CAROLYN
What's not fair? I'm just saying it never
works.

DEAN

Well the first thing that's not fair, is
that you're saying it won't work out
because I'll be too busy or that I'll
find someone new. You're the busiest
woman I know. Sorry, the busiest person.
You never slow down, and it's this curse,
that all the things that I love about you-
-the way you save receipts when we go to
movies so you can write them off; the way
that, when you get an idea in your head
for the store, you can go ten minutes
without hearing a word I say; even the
way you fax me love notes--these same
things are what will keep us apart.

CAROLYN
How?

DEAN
You would never sell that store.

CAROLYN
How could you even ask me to?

DEAN
I'm not asking you to. My point is, it's
more than a store for you. It's
validation. Proof that you can make it
without a husband. Well I think you've
proved it to yourself and to your in-
laws. You said yourself, you don't see
pity on their faces anymore. So who are
you proving it to now? Blockbuster is
offering you enough money that you could
open a new store, twice the size anywhere
you wanted...

Fortune Cookie - 71.

CAROLYN
Not here. They said I can't open one
here. This is where Ann goes to school.

DEAN
For a few more months. Still, you act
like the offer is an insult.

CAROLYN
I'm beginning to see the disadvantages of
having your boyfriend doing the books.

DEAN
What are your views on love?

This is where LU approaches the table to clear dishes.

LU
(noticing the leftovers)
Was there something wrong with the food.
We will gladly execute the chef.

CAROLYN
(flustered)
No. It was fine. Can we get it in a bag.

LU glances distatefully at the picked at remains.

LU exits.

LU
I suppose.

CAROLYN
My views on love?

DEAN
Maybe we should have talked about this
earlier, but, what I'm saying is, where
does love rank? We say it all the time.
"I love you." For some people it's this
consuming thing. It's like a drug, makes
them think in sonnet form. For some
people it's companionship and comfort.
Where does it stand with you?

CAROLYN
Dean, this is difficult. I'm not sure you
should be asking me this.

DEAN

Maybe it should have been a first date
question.

Fortune Cookie - 72.

CAROLYN
Would've been a short first date.
DEAN
I still want to know. I think I need to
know.
CAROLYN
It ranks high.
DEAN
How high?
CAROLYN
Very high.

CAROLYN looks to Dean to see if the answer will suffice. His
expression indicates that it won't.

CAROLYN (CONT'D)
Below motherhood. Is that what you want
to know?

DEAN
Where in comparison to the free
enterprise system?

CAROLYN
You're being mean.

DEAN
But I'm serious. Where do we rank in
comparison to your store.

CAROLYN
You see, you want to make this an easy
comparison--you or the store, but it's
not that simple. It's not about the
store. It's about me. The store is
independence. It's self worth. Look, I
married Tom straight out of high school.
I went straight from being somebody's
daughter to somebody's girlfriend to
somebody's wife to somebody's widow.
Opening that store was the first thing I
did completely on my own.

DEAN
So if both the store and me caught on
fire, and you only had one bucket of
water...

We return to TRENT'S interview scene.

TRENT
Most of the women I date? Let's see, if
there's one recurring trait, I would have
to say that they're all fun. All fun
girls. Definitely out to have a good
time.

66 EXT. TRENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66

TRENT and BETH arrive at Trent's house. They round a shrub,
or wall, or similar barrier and run into a tipsy TERESA who
is fishing her earrings out of the mailbox.

TRENT
Teresa ..this is a surprise.

TERESA
Found them!

TERESA turns and holds up the earrings. Only now does she
notice BETH. She tries to cover.

TERESA (CONT'D)
«and you're right. They'll be perfect for
my audition.

BETH
Someone's doing Bus Stop?
TERESA
What?
BETH
Nothing.
TRENT opens the front door of his house and ushers BETH
inside.
TRENT
(to Beth)
Let me just make sure she makes it out to
the cab.
BETH

Chivalry is not dead.

TRENT shakes his head and escorts TERESA out to the cab.

TERESA

TRENT
Don't worry about it.

TERESA
Is that going anywhere?

TERESA gestures towards the apartment. TRENT shrugs. They
reach the waiting cab.

TERESA (CONT'D)
I'll be up for a while. If you want to
come by afterwards. You've got my number
in that little black book of yours, don't
you?

69 EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DAY 69
We return to BETH'S interview scene.

BETH
I think my problem, on dates, is that I
think of them as automatically
confrontational. Let's face it, guys have
a different set of goals by which they
measure a date's success. I've been
thinking about giving up on men. Maybe
become romantically linked with, say, my
refrigerator, or follow Amanda's advice
and find love online. At least at the end
of the evening, I won't have to hear the
phrase, "I'll call you." Translation--
we'll bump into each other several months
from now, you'll be wearing sweats and
have a cold sore, and I'll introduce you
to my new supermodel fiance.

70 INT. TRENT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 70
TRENT enters his house.
TRENT
So, Stallone's rented a couple movies for
the limo ride. He gives you the choice of
either Rocky Three or...

BETH

TRENT continues walking towards the kitchen while Beth begins
examining the books on the shelves--not the ones left out for
her perusal.

TRENT
«Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. Whatever you
say.

BETH
So you're a jewelry consultant. Very
impressive.

TRENT

She's a friend. We hang out sometimes.

BETH
There's a term for that.

BETH continues examining the book collection

BETH (CONT'D)
Norman Mailer? You like Norman Mailer.

TRENT (0.S.)
You don't?

BETH
As far as corny, narcissistic, adolescent-
sounding, sexist writers full of glib
schtick on highbrow topics, he's not bad.
Oh look, you have his entire oeuvre.

TRENT (0.S.)
Well, we can't all aspire to Ann Tyler
status.

BETH

What's wrong with Ann Tyler?

TRENT (0.S.)
She's boring.

BETH
Where is this phantom dog of yours? Here
Rover! Here Rover!

TRENT returns to the living room with an obviously sick
kitten wrapped in a blanket.

TRENT
Sic her boy. Attack!

The sight of the sick kitten melts BETH a bit.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 76.
70 CONTINUED: 70

BETH
I think it's against some law, naming a
cat Rover. Fines are involved.

TRENT
Not Rover--Ro VAIR. He's named for the
French poet.

BETH
(suspiciously)
RoVAIR?
TRENT

Man, you don't let anything slide. Can
you help me here.

BETH
What do I need to do?

TRENT
Just wrap up his legs here in the
blanket.

BETH
Like this?

TRENT
Yeah, that's good.

The maneuvering and repositioning TRENT and BETH undertake in
order to medicate the cat forces them into close physical
proximity to each other.

TRENT (CONT'D)
This is not the most pleasant part of his
day. He's like one of those Aliens trying
to claw out of someone's chest. Okay, Ro--
it's time for your Shirley Temple.

TRENT withdraws a small bottle of pinkish medicine and a
dropper that he tries to force into Rover's mouth.

TRENT (CONT'D)
(singing)
"On the good ship, Lollypop. It's a
something, something, to the candy shop."

BETH
Sweet trip. How old is he?

Fortune Cookie - 77.
70 CONTINUED: 70

TRENT
I'm not sure. I just found him out in the
alley going through my garbage. I don't
think he comes from a very good family.

TRENT successfully gets ROVER to swallow his drops. He sits
down on a couch and pets the kitten while Beth wanders back
to the bookcases.

BETH
You have every Doctor Seuss book.

TRENT
(slightly embarrassed)
Not every one.

BETH
What are you missing?

TRENT
The Cat In The Hat Comes Back. I don't go
for sequels.

BETH
You're so cool.

71 INT. HEATH'S CAR - NIGHT 71

HEATH and DOUG drive towards the dance. DOUG appears
distracted or upset.

HEATH
I'm sorry you didn't get to see Dean
propose.

DOUG
It's not just that. They didn't look
happy.

HEATH

My parents never look happy. I think
that's just part of being old.

DOUG
Yeah, but you should see them together
most of the time. It's like they can't
keep their hands off each other. It
always embarrasses Troy.

The present tense mention of Troy seems to bother HEATH.

DOUG (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. That's rude.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 78.
71 CONTINUED: 71

HEATH
It's not that. I just got this mental
picture of my mom kissing some strange
man.

HEATH shudders.

DOUG
Well Dean's cool. And I want Mom to be
happy.

HEATH

I think that's what makes you different.

DOUG
Different from what.

HEATH
From the stereotype.

DOUG
What stereotype?

HEATH
From the "Girls who could get by on their
looks" stereotype.

DOUG
In case you were wondering. I'm not
taking this as a compliment.

HEATH
Yeah. I'm sorry. That does sound bad. All
I mean is that it must be a challenge.
Everybody wants to make you happy,
somehow or in some way. I think it would
be hard to keep from thinking the world
revolved around you.

DOUG
What makes you think I don't? Because I
danced with your friend in junior high?

HEATH
No. More than that. That you're excited
for your Mom. That you don't care if she
embarrasses you in front of your
boyfriend. That you actually try hard in
Trig. I don't know, partly it's because
you said you'd come to this with me.

DOUG

Let's not go to the dance.

HEATH
I don't get it. Are you serious?

DOUG
I just don't feel like it.

HEATH
You don't feel like it.

DOUG
Have you ever been to these things? The
band is always lame. It costs too much. A
bunch of drunks stepping on your feet.

HEATH
To answer your question, no, I haven't
been to one. Four years of high school.
Zero formal dances. You're the first
person--well, no, your mom is the first
person--you're the second person ever to
see me in a tuxedo. These things may be
stupid, but I'd like the chance to find
out for myself.

DOUG
We could do something else.

HEATH sighs and shakes his head.

HEATH
I don't know exactly what your problem
is. I don't know if you're embarrassed to
be seen with me. Maybe you're afraid
you'll see Troy with someone else. Maybe
you really do hate dances. But I wish you
would have just said no when I asked you.

DOUG
Just take me home.

a small tray beside them.

DEAN
So that's it. I guess I'll tell them I'll

DEAN
They want me out there in a month.

CAROLYN
Then let's make it a good month.

DEAN
I don't think so.

CAROLYN
You just want to call it off right here.

DEAN
One year. It has a certain mathematical
perfection to it.

CAROLYN

And we all know how important that is. It

Return to DOUG'S interview scene.

DOUG
Mom doesn't know this, but I did go out
with a college guy for a couple months. I
think those were the months right after
my lobotomy. The only difference I could
ever figure out is that he didn't ask me
to wear his letter jacket. The thing
about guys--and I can't decide if this is
a minus or a plus--is that they're
predictable. You know exactly what
they're going to do.

74 INT. HEATH'S CAR - NIGHT 74
HEATH and DOUG ride in silence.

DOUG
Heath, I want to tell you something.
First of all, I wouldn't be embarrassed
to go to the dance with you. Not at all.
When we left tonight. I had every
intention of going through with it.

HEATH
Go through with it?

DOUG
I don't mean it like that. The truth is,
Troy called me before you came to pick me
up. He wants to get back together--after
tonight. He already had a date.

HEATH
So you don't want to screw it up by going
in there with me.

DOUG
No. That's not it. I was going to make
him jealous. To punish him. To show
everyone I wasn't just sitting around
waiting for him to come back to me. And
I was using you to do that. And that was
okay when you were just some guy I didn't

DOUG
On what?
HEATH
On the surprise factor ..when I asked you.
DOUG
Good strategy.
HEATH
So what made you change your mind?
DOUG
About the dance?
HEATH
Yeah.

Trent "The Grateful Dead" Kennedy.

BETH doesn't respond.

That was a joke. Anyway, I ran across the
hall with a tape recorder and got him to
sign my book and do a promo.

BETH
A promo?

TRENT
Yeah, I play it every once in a while for
a laugh. It's him saying, "I'm John
Irving, and whenever I'm in town, I rock
harder on one oh one point seven."
Afterwards, I get all these calls wanting
to know if John Irving plays bass for

Primus.

BETH
You don't strike me as the DJ-type,
Trent.

TRENT

That's what my station manager was saying
the other day.

BETH
I just figured DJs were obnoxious all the

INT. LES VIDEO - DAY 79

CAROLYN continues her interview.

CAROLYN
There was this guy who asked me out every
day for two weeks. He was probably close
to seventy, and he kept renting the
raciest things we had in the store,
anything with the word erotic on the
cover. He would rent the maximum six
tapes at a time then return them the next
day and rent six more. I'd ask him if he
enjoyed the movies, and he'd say, "Not as
much as I would if you'd watch them with
me." Then he'd laugh this little evil
laugh. Turns out, he was dubbing
portions of "The Greatest Story Ever
Told" over every steamy scene. I had to
take him to small claims court. But I
remember, very clearly, missing the daily
proposition.

Watch it sister. That's a little friendly

CAROLYN
Sorry, forgot. I really couldn't believe
you had the nerve to take me to a drive-
in on our first date.

DEAN
Why's that? Do you have some unwholesome
memories you want to share?

CAROLYN
Not at all. We didn't have a drive-in in
my hometown. It's just the reputation,
you know, drive-ins equal hanky panky.

DEAN
Not for me. My oldest brother used to
take all five us here when we were kids.
I'll always think of drive-ins as John
Wayne, Coke down my shorts, and a trip to
the swing set when the kissing started.

CAROLYN
You know what I remember most about our
first date?

DEAN
My punctuality?

Well you'd be surprised. You know I
didn't date much, hardly at all, before
you, but every time I tried to pay, it
was like I was asking my date to get a
vasectomy. Like somehow I was neutering
him by not letting him pay. It showed
you were confident. There's nothing more
attractive than confidence.

DEAN
Now, in all fairness to those weenies you
went out with before, it is a tough call.
I mean, I asked you out. It only stands
to reason that I should pay.

CAROLYN
What do you mean, you asked me out? I
asked out you out.

DEAN
You asked me if I could come over to go
over your books with you. That's not a
date.

CAROLYN
I mentioned food.

DEAN
You asked me if I liked Pringles. I'm the
one who suggested we make a night of it.

CAROLYN
I'm glad you did.

CAROLYN leans over onto DEAN'S shoulder.
DEAN
Do you think I should let my buddies out
of the trunk yet.

CAROLYN
Make ‘em suffer.

EXT. FLIGHT PATH COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 82

HEATH'S car pulls up in front of the coffee shop. As it does,
the rumble of a jet drowns out all other sounds.

INT. HEATH'S BEDROOM - DAY 83

We return to HEATH'S interview scene

HEATH
I think my biggest fear in all this is
being a sap. You know that little red
headed girl that Charlie Brown has been
after for, uh, let's see ..eternity.
Everybody knows it ain't gonna happen. It
makes you want to scream at him. Charlie
hang it up. She doesn't know you're
alive. But what can you really tell a guy
who falls for the football trick every
time? I just don't want to be like that.

INT. FLIGHT PATH COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT 84

A few late night laptop-clacking screenwriters, bohemians and
college students inhabit the eclectically decorated and dimly-
lit Flight Path Coffee Shop. A twenty-something woman, ELLEN,

works the

counter. She sees HEATH and begins preparing his

caramel cappuccino.

ELLEN
Heath, I see you got our mailing about
the new dress code. (Louder) None of
these other slackers did.

HEATH

Yeah. Uh, Ellen, this is Doug.
ELLEN

Hi.
DOUG

Hello.

ELLEN sets HEATH'S drink down.

ELLEN
And what can I get for you?

DOUG
Strawberry Smoothie?

ELLEN
That's a lot of work.

DOUG
I can get something else.

ELLEN
I'll suck it up. Why don't I bring it out
to you. Heath, I believe your table is
available.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 91.
84 CONTINUED: 84

HEATH
Thanks, Ellen.

HEATH begins leading DOUG to the appropriate table.

DOUG
You must come here a lot.

HEATH
My rare visits are memorable.

DOUG
Mmhhhmmm.

HEATH leads DOUG to two high-back antique chairs that face a
liver shaped vintage coffee table and a puffy couch.
Displayed on the wall above this conglomeration is Heath's
piece d'art--a 3D cityscape fashioned out of painted boxes of
various size and shape, toy soldiers, Weebles, model trains,
Hot Wheels, etc. Everything is cemented down. It hangs like a
normal, if bulky, painting. HEATH gives DOUG the chair with
the better view of the work.

DOUG (CONT'D)
(noticing the piece)
Whoa, funky.

HEATH
Funky good or funky bad?

DOUG
(pausing for serious
consideration)
Funky good. This won't match anyone's
couch.

HEATH
Thanks.

DOUG
You did this?

HEATH
Yeah.

DOUG
Very cool. Is there a theme, some special
meaning?

HEATH

You mean like man's inhumanity to man or
something like that?

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 92.

84 CONTINUED: 84

DOUG

Yeah.
HEATH

No.
DOUG

Good.
HEATH

You know what would be funny?
DOUG

What?
HEATH

If, right here in front of everybody, we
took it down off the wall and started
playing with it. Moving stuff around,
making car sounds.

DOUG
Wobbling the Weebles.

HEATH
Are you going to get back together with
Troy?

DOUG

I told him I would.

HEATH
He seems all right.

DOUG
He is.

ELLEN delivers the Strawberry Smoothie.

ELLEN
Here you go.

DOUG
Thanks.

ELLEN

So how was prom? If I'm going to have to
listen to you go on about it for three
weeks, I deserve the scoop.

HEATH

Boring. The band was lame. Drunks
everywhere.

ELLEN
Ah, too bad. Well the really important
thing is you guys look great.

HEATH
Thanks.

ELLEN leaves HEATH and DOUG at their table. DOUG is somber.

DOUG
I am so sorry.

HEATH
It's nothing.

EXT. ICE CREAM SHOP - NIGHT

BETH and TRENT eat ice cream cones as they sit on a bench or

at a sidewalk table outside of an ice cream shop.

TRENT
I don't know what the Chinese did before
ice cream. If I eat anything spicy, I've
gotta have ice cream.

BETH
You know what they say. You can't miss
what you've never had.

TRENT
Now that sounds like a fortune cookie.

BETH
That must be where I heard it.

TRENT
I read this thing the other day. It was
too long to be a fortune cookie. I think
it was a quote from someone semi-famous.
It said that a relationship was
impossible between two people if their
favorite movies couldn't stand to be in
the same room together at a party.

BETH
Their favorite movies?

TRENT
Yeah. If movies were personified, would
they hit it off? Like, I doubt The
Bicycle Thief and Porky's Revenge would
be hanging out by the punchbowl together.
So what's yours?

BETH
My favorite movie?

TRENT
Yeah.

BETH
Guess.

TRENT

Something by Bergman.

BETH shakes her head.

TRENT (CONT'D)
Fellini?

BETH
Please.

TRENT
Thelma and Louise.

BETH doesn't respond. She looks disgruntled. TRENT laughs.

TRENT (CONT. )
(CONT'D)
That's it! That was so easy.
BETH
So what's yours? American Gigolo?
TRENT
No, but that's a party I wouldn't want to
miss.
BETH

So what is it?

TRENT
Not important. How is that vanilla? I
can't believe you ordered vanilla.

BETH
Not so fast, pal. Favorite flick. Let's
hear it.

TRENT

I'm not saying. I'm hoping this way
you'll describe me as mysterious to your
roommate.

(CONTINUED )
85

86

CONTINUED:

Fortune Cookie - 95.
85

BETH
After the way I've laid my soul bare to
you tonight. So, what does that leave us
with? Are we back to first date word
games?

TRENT
I think it may be the only safe
territory. You haven't been exactly
forthcoming, and every time I've gutted
it up and started to tell a story, a real
story, you either look like you're going
to nod off or you make fun of me.

BETH
Really? I don't mean to; it's just that
your stories--I don't know--the way they
come out; they sound rehearsed. Maybe
rehearsed is a bit harsh. It sounds like
you're even tired of telling them. I know
everyone has stories that they repeat all
the time, but...

TRENT
You don't.

BETH
I don't. It's too easy. It's like going
on dating autopilot. One story to show
you're strong. One story to show you're
sensitive. One story to show you've got a
sense of humor.

TRENT
But isn't that what dating's about. You
tell each other your stories. If you like
each other's stories, you keep going out.

BETH
There has to be something more to it. I
mean, what happens when you run out of
stories?

TRENT
You live together.

EXT. LES VIDEO - NIGHT 86

DOUG uses a key to open the door of the closed video store.
She punches in the alarm code as soon as she enters, but she
doesn't turn on the lights. Light is provided by
streetlights, exit sign, cars, etc.

(CONTINUED )
86

CONTINUED:

Fortune Cookie - 96.
86

HEATH
(whispering)
Are you sure this is okay?

DOUG
(normal volume)
Sure. I'm just leaving the lights off, so
people don't try to come in and rent
something. So what do you want to see?

HEATH starts walking down the aisles checking out the titles.
DOUG follows him, not really looking at the videos.

HEATH
You know my friend Ryan? The first day he
went to work at Dunkin' Donuts, they told
him he could eat all the donuts he wanted
for free, so, of course, Ryan just pigged
out, ate like twenty on his first day.

DOUG
I can't believe they let him do that.

HEATH
Yeah, well, they know what they're doing.
Ryan ended up getting so sick that he
says he'll never eat another donut again.
That's their little plan.

DOUG
Devious.

HEATH
So is that how you are with movies? Sick
of them?

DOUG

They're on when I'm working, so I don't
take them home very often. Besides, if
there's a movie in the house, it's too
easy not to do my homework.

HEATH
If there's a toaster in my house, it's
easy for me not to do my homework.

DOUG
Well, I have this secret goal. I got two
B's my freshman year, but I haven't made
any since.

HEATH
Same here.

(CONTINUED )
86

CONTINUED:

Fortune Cookie - 97.

86
DOUG
The rest have been A's.
HEATH
Oh.
DOUG

If I get A's the rest of the year, I'll
be the salutatorian.

HEATH
Wow. I always knew you were smart, but
there's smart, then there's salutatorian
smart. I wouldn't have guessed you were
up there. I mean... Don't take that wrong.

DOUG
No. I understand. That's the secret part.
I don't want anyone to know. I never tell
anyone what I made on tests or homework
or what I got in a class. I don't even
think Troy knows. And it's not that I'm
all that smart; my SATs prove that. I
just work hard at it.

HEATH
That sounds like ambition to me.

DOUG
Ambition to make good grades seems kind
of pointless if there's nothing you
really want to do with it, but the
scholarship money will come in handy.

HEATH
So why don't you want anyone to know.

DOUG
Because it's so uncool. Not to be smart,
really, but to try really hard for
something. You say one of the reasons you
asked me to the dance was because you
didn't think I fit some stereotype, but
in a lot of ways, I do. Look at me. I'ma
cheerleader who dates a football player
and doesn't want anyone to think she's
has a brain.

HEATH
Man, I hope nobody finds out I went out
with you.

INT. CAROLYN'S CAR - MAJESTIC DRIVE-IN - NIGHT 87

The drive in parking lot is empty except for CAROLYN'S car.
The movie is over. CAROLYN is asleep against Dean's shoulder.
DEAN is awake and staring blankly at the screen.

DEAN
Wake up little Susie.

DEAN squeezes CAROLYN with the arm he has wrapped around her.
CAROLYN opens her eyes, yawns...

DEAN (CONT'D)
You missed it. The swamp monster managed
to organize all the textile workers into
a union.

CAROLYN
I was dreaming about the lake house.

DEAN
What lake house.

CAROLYN
The one you said I'd be living in when
I'm retired.

DEAN
Was it nice?

CAROLYN
It was too big.

DEAN
Where to now?

CAROLYN
On our first date, you took me straight
home. I thought you must not have liked
me very much, you were in such a hurry to
get rid of me.

DEAN
I had forgotten about that.

CAROLYN
I wasn't sure you were going to slow down
when we got there. I thought I was going
to have to do a Charlie's Angels roll out
of the car.

DEAN and CAROLYN both realize.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Shit.
CAROLYN
She's on the West Coast, she's probably
still awake.
CAROLYN starts up the car.
DEAN
Yeah, methodically clipping my face out
of every family photo.
INT. TRENT'S CAR OUTSIDE BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 88
BETH and TRENT sit in TRENT'S parked car.
BETH
I don't see how you do it. You're not
even going to get five hours of sleep.
TRENT
The really demented part is that this is
what DJs strive for--the morning shift.
Prime time in radio land. It's not like,
if I get better, they'll give me a shift
where I can sleep in.
The car is consumed in silence.
BETH
Well thanks. I had a nice time.
EXT. BETH'S APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - NIGHT 89

BETH pulls at her door handle and starts to get out of the
car. TRENT quickly follows suit. The two converse while
moving towards the door.

TRENT
I'll walk you up.

BETH
I'm fine, really.

TRENT
If I don't I won't get my merit badge.

(CONTINUED )
Fortune Cookie - 100.
89 CONTINUED: 89

The rest of the short walk is taken in silence. They arrive
at the door.

TRENT (CONT'D)
Do you have a clock alarm?

BETH
Sure.

TRENT
Set it for seven.

BETH
Why?

TRENT

I'll say something to you in code on the
air. Everyone will hear it, but you'll be
the only one who'll understand.

BETH
Oh. I don't think that'll work.
TRENT
Sure it will.
BETH
My clock alarm--that's all it is. No
radio.
TRENT

You don't have a radio?
BETH shakes her head.

BETH
I've thought about getting one, though.

As she says this, TRENT leans in and tries to kiss BETH. BETH
head dodges. After appropriate awkwardness...

TRENT
Sorry.

BETH
(curious, not mean)
Have you sent secret coded radio messages
to a lot of women?
TRENT doesn't respond right away.

BETH (CONT'D)
You see what I mean?

Women, men, friends, relatives. I guess I

BETH
Yeah, well, thanks again.

TRENT
I had fun.

BETH
Me too.

TRENT
I'll give you a call.

BETH gives a "Yeah, right" nod and opens her door.

BETH
Good night, Trent.

TRENT
Good night.

BETH closes the door. TRENT trudges away. He points an
imaginary gun at his head and pulls the trigger.

INT. BETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 90

BETH comes out of her own bedroom having changed into sweat
bottoms and a T-shirt. She knocks on AMANDA'S door and walks
in. AMANDA is still camped in front of her computer

BETH
Hey, what're you doing?

AMANDA
Having sex. Can't you tell?

BETH
I'll come back later.

BETH exits the room. She wanders into the kitchen, opens the
freezer and contemplates her pint of Ben & Jerry's. Shaking
her head in disgust, she pulls it out and gets a spoon. BETH
then sits down on the couch and uses the remote control to
turn on Saturday Night Live. She watches a few seconds of
some lame skit, but she quickly begins eyeing the CD rack
next to the TV.

BETH pulls her fortune out of her purse and begins rifling
through the CDs. She refers, once again, to the fortune.

thirteenth track. She takes out the CD and puts it in the
deck. "Take A Chance On Me" begins to play. BETH counts the
verses out loud.

ABBA
If you change your mind...
BETH
Line one.
ABBA
On the mercy line...
BETH
Line two.
ABBA
Honey I'm still free...
BETH

ABBA
Take a chance on me...
BETH

vocalists)

Take a chance. Take a chance.
INT. TRENT'S CAR - NIGHT 91

TRENT drives home from BETH'S apartment. He's cranks the song
"Fortune Cookie" that's playing on the radio.

EXT. THE DOUGLAS DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 92

DEAN is leaning on his Suburban. He's talking to his mother
on a cellular phone. CAROLYN is close enough that she can
hear what he's saying.

DEAN

lot closer. ..Well, she's got the business

DEAN hangs up the phone and tosses it in his vehicle. As the
two talk they make their way towards the front door...

DEAN (CONT'D)
Sorry. Her opinions are her own and don't
reflect those of her offspring.

CAROLYN
I'd invite you in, but it looks like
Ann's here with her date.

DEAN

Do you want to come over?
CAROLYN

I don't think so.
DEAN

So this is it.
CAROLYN

How soon do they want you out there?
DEAN

A month.
CAROLYN

We could still see each other until you
have to leave.

DEAN
That's no good. I'm one of those people
who likes to rip the band aid off, not
peel it off slowly. It doesn't hurt as
long that way.

CAROLYN
I've never broken up with someone that
I'm still in love with before. This is
one of those times when you know what it
feels like to be an adult.

By now, they've arrived at the front door.

DEAN
Anything you need. Ever. Just call.

CAROLYN
I need you to do something awful--cheat

kindness. I need you to break my heart.

INT. DOUGLAS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 93

DOUG and HEATH sit on the couch, a safe distance between
them. They watch The African Queen.

HEATH
I think that would have been a cool time
to be alive.

DOUG
Yeah, you'd have World War One and the
depression to look forward to.

HEATH
I just liked the idea of wearing a cool
hat and getting to say "dames," but since
you put it that way.

CAROLYN comes in the front door, obviously upset. She walks
right past the teenagers on the sofa and enters the kitchen.
DOUG follows her.

DOUG
Mom? What's wrong? Are you okay?

CAROLYN
I'm okay. I just need something to drink.

DOUG pours her mother a glass of water. CAROLYN has taken a

DOUG
Then what was the ring for? Who gives a
‘breaking up' ring?

CAROLYN
What was what ring for?

DOUG
He had a ring. It fell out of his pocket
before he picked you up. I saw it. I
thought he was going to pop the question
tonight. That's why we went to The
Empire. I wanted to see your expression
when he asked you.

CAROLYN
He did.

DOUG
He asked you? What did you say?

CAROLYN
(realizing)
I told him not to be silly.

DOUG
Mom...

CAROLYN stands. She takes the phone down off the wall and

begins to

dial. Deciding against that plan of action, she

hangs it back up. She repeats that process. She picks up her
purse, then sets it back down again. Terribly confused, she

sits.

DOUG (CONT'D)
Go.

CAROLYN
All right. What do I say when I get
there? Using my X-ray vision, I've
noticed a diamond ring in your pocket. Do
you mind telling me what you were
planning on doing with it?

I won't wait up.

CAROLYN pops her head back in the door.

CAROLYN
Heath, nice seeing you again. You guys
can have another half hour before Heath
needs to head home.

DOUG
But Mom, that doesn't give us enough time
to watch...

CAROLYN shuts the door.

DOUG (CONT'D)
Caligula

HEATH
Do you think she was mad because I'm over
here and it's after midnight?

DOUG
Why would she be mad?

HEATH
She said she wanted you home early,
because you had to work in the morning.

DOUG
Oh yeah, that. She won't care. Hey, you
paused the movie.

HEATH
I didn't want you to miss it..

DOUG
Wow. You're the first male of the species
I've ever known to pause the movie when
somebody else leaves the room.

Embarrassed, HEATH finishes his sentence.

because then I'd have to tell you what
happened when you weren't watching.

DOUG
I'm glad you asked me out. I've needed to
meet someone like you.

HEATH
I'm glad I did too. I don't think I'd
rent the tux if I had it to do all over
again, or take dance lessons.

DOUG
You took dance lessons?

HEATH
I figured it was necessary--unless you
planned on square dancing. Don't worry. I
didn't go out and pay for them. I just
had my sister show me.

DOUG uses the remote control to turn the TV off. She walks
over to a jambox, inserts a cassette and hits play. Some
romantic slow song comes on.

DOUG
Let's see it. Show me what you've
learned.

HEATH

Where's the mirror ball. I don't boogie
without a mirror ball.

Doug beckons him with her finger.

HEATH (CONT'D)
All right. Try to keep up.

DOUG places her hands on HEATH'S shoulders. HEATH nervously
positions his hands on DOUG'S waist. They begin a type four
dance. After a moment, DOUG scoots in a little closer.

HEATH (CONT'D)
Cool. Type three dancing.

Type three, according to Beth, a girl, is
a sure sign of non-revulsion.

DOUG
You're not going to cut off your ear and
mail it to me, are you?

HEATH
No, but in my next masterpiece, there
might be a weeble-ette in a red dress.

DOUG
All right--immortality.

They dance for a moment.

HEATH
Wait a minute. I know the answer ..to the
riddle ..your fortune. They all get pushed
around.

DOUG
A lawnmower. A revolving door.

HEATH
And a sap.

DOUG
Oh wow. I wasn't thinking of it that way.
What do you think it's supposed to mean?

I don't know. I think there's a law
against siblings attempting it.

DOUG burrows in closer--cheek to cheek or lips to ears now.
As they spin and we see DOUG'S face, he wears a sublime
smile.

DOUG

97 EXT. DEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAROLYN knocks on DEAN'S door. DEAN answers. The two
there awkwardly for a moment.

CAROLYN
Marry me.

DEAN
No.

CAROLYN

Is that soup bowl of mine still here.

DEAN
You don't get to ask that question. It's
mine. I bought a ring and everything.

DEAN produces the ring.

CAROLYN
Have I spoiled the drama?

DEAN
I'm still shaking. Carolyn, the backwards
way I asked earlier--I deserved a no.

CAROLYN
Try again.

DEAN
Marry me.

CAROLYN
I can't think of a single reason not to.

The two kiss joyfully.
INT. THE EMPIRE - NIGHT 98
We return to GARRETT'S interview scene.

GARRETT

Call me jaded, but at least I know what
my job is here. I'm not in the fortune
business. I'm just supposed to provide a
conversation piece for our customers.
Not everybody gets it. I know this guy
who swears by fortune cookies, because he
got four out of six numbers on the
lottery off a fortune cookie and won a
few hundred bucks. If it were me, I'd
wonder why the cookie didn't give me the
other two digits. If anything I write
ever does come true, it's because it's
self-fulfilling. People believe what they
want to believe. And most people want to
believe in happy endings.

(Long, long pause)
Not me. I like it when endings are
unapologetically grim. The hero gets
committed to an asylum and his lover has
to marry a drug lord to pay the bills.
Now that's a finale.

FADE TO BLACK.
