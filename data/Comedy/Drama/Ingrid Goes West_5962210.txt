CUT TO:
ECU: The images are reflected in the eyes of a YOUNG WOMAN.

CLOSE on her THUMB scrolling through Instagram, compulsively
‘Liking’ EVERY SINGLE POST. Tap-tap, tap-tap, tap-tap.

CHARLOTTE (V.O.)

Happy to be sharing this day with
all of my favorite humans. Hashtag
blessed.

I/E. CAR - NIGHT

INGRID THORBURN, 29, stares at the photo of Charlotte on her
phone, the hood of her sweatshirt pulled up over her head,
mascara tears running down both cheeks. She looks up.

HER POV - She is parked outside the LAKE HOUSE from the
photos. A wedding party is in full swing, music thumping.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ingrid steps out of the car, wearing running shoes and a
cocktail dress underneath her sweatshirt. We TRACK with her
as she makes her way across the lawn, towards a large TENT
filled with tables and people dancing.

Ingrid weaves her way through the crowd, unnoticed. She
grabs a glass of champagne from a passing caterer and slugs
it, tossing the empty glass aside as she notices --
CHARLOTTE

-- sitting at her table, still in her wedding dress, telling
an animated story to a group of enthralled WEDDING GUESTS.

INGRID
Hi Charlotte.

Charlotte and a few of her guests turn, smiling. Charlotte
recognizes Ingrid and just as suddenly her smile vanishes.

CHARLOTTE
Ingrid...?
INGRID
Congratulations.

Ingrid holds up a PEPPER SPRAY GUN and blasts Charlotte in
the face. Charlotte squeezes her eyes shut, screaming.

INGRID (CONT'D)
THANKS FOR INVITING ME, CUNT!

The party erupts into chaos. Charlotte’s bridesmaids rush to
her aid. Ingrid tries to make a run for it but is tackled to
the dance floor by a couple of athletic GROOMSMEN.

CLOSE on Ingrid writhing on the floor and sobbing as we --
CUT TO:
A STATIC SHOT of the Pacific Ocean shimmering under a pink
and orange sky. We HEAR the sound of waves crashing against
the shoreline as the TITLE FADES IN --
INGRID GOES WEST

We PULL BACK to reveal that the beach is a motivational
poster hanging on an otherwise empty wall.

INGRID (V.O.)
Dear Charlotte.

A calmer, healthier-looking Ingrid sits on the edge of a twin
bed inside the sterile room, staring up at the poster. She
looks down at the notebook in her lap and continues writing --

INGRID (V.O.)
I just want you to know how sorry I
am about what happened.

INT. HALLWAY - THE MEADOWS - MORNING
Ingrid steps up to a window where a nurse hands her a paper
cup filled with medicine. She tosses back her pills and
opens her mouth wide, sticking out her tongue.
INGRID (V.O.)

In a lot of ways, having this time

apart has been good for me. It’s

given me a chance to reflect.

INT. REC ROOM - THE MEADOWS - DAY

Ingrid plays ping-pong against a pale 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
INGRID (V.O.)
I’m learning how to be present.

INT. CAFETERIA - THE MEADOWS - DAY

Ingrid is eating a sandwich and reading a worn copy of The
Language of Letting Go, highlighting her favorite passages.

INGRID (V.0.)
How to live in the moment.

INT. REC ROOM - THE MEADOWS - DAY

Ingrid sits in a circle with a small group, nodding in
sympathy as a female patient shares a harrowing story.

INGRID (V.O.)
How to listen.

INT. REC ROOM - THE MEADOWS - NIGHT

Ingrid and her fellow patients are sitting in chairs watching
Clueless on a pull-down projector screen. Ingrid laughs,
then pauses, remembering something.

INGRID (V.O.)
Sometimes I’1l hear a joke or see
something that reminds me of you
and I feel sad because I have no
way of telling you about it.

EXT. GRASSY AREA - THE MEADOWS - MORNING
Ingrid sits cross-legged, meditating next to a large oak tree.
INGRID (V.O.)
But maybe that’s okay. Maybe it’s
good to feel alone once in a while.
INT. REC ROOM - THE MEADOWS - DAY
Ingrid waves goodbye to the other patients, exchanging hugs.
INGRID (V.O.)
I don’t know what the future holds

for me. I just know that things
are going to be different now.
INT. LOBBY - THE MEADOWS - DAY

Ingrid is waiting at the front desk clutching a faded L.L.
Bean backpack with her name stitched across the top. She
makes sure no one is watching then reaches over the counter
and slides a stamped envelope into the OUTGOING MAIL bin.

INGRID (V.O.)
Hopefully someday you and I can
look back on all of this and laugh.

A NURSE appears, handing Ingrid a plastic bag filled with her
personal items. Ingrid opens the bag, taking out her IPHONE.

CLOSE on the phone. We SEE Ingrid’s face reflected in the
glass. She cradles it in her hand, caressing the screen.

INGRID (V.O.)
Your friend, always --

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
Ingrid!

Ingrid turns, snapping out of her reverie.

HER POV - Ingrid’s sister, ERIN, 32, pregnant and dressed in
catalog casual, stands in the lobby. She waves, hopeful.

I/E. ERIN’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY

Erin drives while Ingrid rides shotgun with her head out the
window, staring out at the Pennsylvania suburbs as they pass
by. She notices a Corona billboard with the slogan “Find
Your Beach” and smiles.

ERIN
Sorry I’m late. I had to pull
Logan out of karate class. His
sensei had a cold sore.

Ingrid turns towards the backseat, still glowing.

INGRID
How’s my little black belt, huh?

Erin’s son, LOGAN, 4, sits in the back with headphones on,
staring at his iPad. He doesn’t look up.

ERIN
Oh, by the way, if anyone asks, we
told people you were at a yoga
retreat.
6.

Ingrid looks at Erin, confused. She laughs uncomfortably.

INGRID
For eight weeks?

ERIN
We thought it’d be easier for you
to not have to keep explaining to
everyone where you were.

INGRID
Yeah, the thing is... a big part of
the healing process is learning how
to talk about what happened and not
care what other people think.

ERIN
Totally get it. Keith and I just
feel like all the hospital stuff
might be a little heavy for Logan.
He’s only in Pre-K.

INGRID
So what? You want me to pretend
like everything's perfect?

ERIN
No! Of course not. You can talk
about it as much as you want. Just
as long as we're talking about yoga
and not, you know...

Ingrid is silent. This doesn’t sit well with her.

ERIN (CONT'D)
So... do you want to talk about it?

INGRID
Not anymore.

They continue driving in silence. Ingrid turns back towards
the window, her glow fading a bit.
EXT. ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING

A single-story Colonial house with a big yard. A police
motorcycle is parked next to Erin’s SUV in the driveway.
INT. NURSERY - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - DAY

The door opens and Erin’s husband KEITH, 39, enters wearing a
short-sleeved cop uniform, his shirt unbuttoned revealing a
white tee underneath. He flicks on the light.

KEITH
-- and last but not least, I give
you the Ingrid Suite. Voila.

Ingrid enters, looking around, with Erin close behind.

HER POV - A baby’s nursery has been transformed into a
temporary guest room. There is a cozy-looking bed with fresh
flowers on the nightstand, a flat-screen TV, a basket filled
with snacks and a banner that reads: “WELCOME HOME, INGRID!”

INGRID
(touched)
You guys, this is so nice.

ERIN
Stay as long as you want.

KEITH
Our casa is su casa.

INGRID
You didn’t have to do all this.
I’1ll only be here a few days.

Ingrid sets down her backpack and opens the closet. Erin and
Keith exchange a worried look.

ERIN
Where were you planning on going?

INGRID
(read: obviously)
Back to Mom’s house? Where all my
stuff is?

Ingrid turns on the closet light and pauses. It’s filled
with clothes and cardboard boxes labeled: “INGRID”

ERIN
We were gonna wait until you were
settled in to tell you but --

KEITH
(ripping off the band-aid)
We sold the house, Ingrid.
Ingrid stares at them, completely blindsided.
CUT TO:
Erin and Keith are standing outside the bathroom door.

INGRID (0.S.)
Half that house was mine! She left
it to both of us!

ERIN
Exactly. Which is why we put half
of the money in a checking account
under your name.

KEITH
Big ol’ chunk of change, Ingrid.

No response.

ERIN
We figured you could use it. How
else were we supposed to pay for
all your medical bills?

The door flies open and Ingrid appears, eyes red.

INGRID
Don’t you mean my yoga retreat?!

KEITH
Easy, Ingrid --

INGRID
No! Ever since Mom died, you guys
have been waiting to kick me out.
You just couldn't help yourselves,
could you?!

ERIN
Ingy, that house was a dump. It
was not a healthy environment for
you.

Ingrid sits on the bed and closes her eyes, doing a breathing
exercise, trying to calm herself.

INGRID
I'd like to be alone now, please.
KEITH
(to Erin)

Why don’t you tell her how much we
got for it?
INGRID
Why don’t you go fuck yourself?

Silence. Erin gives Keith a look telling him to wait outside.

KEITH
Okey-dokey.

Keith exits. Erin sits next to Ingrid on the bed.

ERIN
Look, I know how close you were
with Mom. I can’t even imagine how
hard that must have been for you.
And after what happened with
Charlotte --

INGRID
Erin...

ERIN
My point is, try and see this as an
opportunity. A chance to put all
that negativity behind you and
start fresh. You can build a whole
new life for yourself. The life
you always wanted.

INGRID
I don’t know what life I want.

ERIN
Don’t worry. It’ll come to you.

Ingrid says nothing. Erin takes her cue and exits, leaving
behind a BANK FOLDER with Ingrid’s name on it.

Ingrid buries her face in a pillow and SCREAMS. She lies
there for a moment, then tosses the pillow aside, pulling out
her phone and powering it on. The warm glow of the screen
lights up her face as she stares at it longingly.

ON THE SCREEN - She opens Instagram and searches
@badcharlotte. Charlotte’s profile appears with a message:

“This User Is Private.”

Ingrid sighs. She lies back on the bed, listening to the
muffled family sounds downstairs, feeling empty and alone.
10.

INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

ECU: A series of items being scanned -- an at-home facial
kit, a bag of gummy worms, the latest issue of Vanity Fair, a
six-pack of Corona, a bottle of prescription pills...

Ingrid stands at the pharmacy counter with her earbuds in,
listening to an audiobook while a PHARMACIST rings her up.

MELODY BEATTIE (V.O.)
Maybe our pain is showing us we
need to set a boundary. Maybe it’s
showing us we’re going in a wrong
direction...

Ingrid looks up to see two of CHARLOTTE’S FRIENDS (JENNY and
NICOLE) walking past. They make knowing eye contact with
Ingrid, who quickly turns the other way.

The pharmacist hands Ingrid a plastic bag. She grabs it,
throwing down cash and making a beeline for the exit.

MELODY BEATTIE (V.O.)
It’s okay to feel hurt; it’s okay
to cry; it’s okay to heal; it’s
okay to move on to the next
feeling, when it’s time...

Ingrid is almost to the door when she sees Jenny and Nicole
rounding the corner right in front of her. Ingrid hides
behind a cardboard display filled with candy.

We HOLD on Ingrid’s face as she waits for them to pass,
removing her earbuds so she can hear them whispering --

JENNY (0.S.)
-- what is up with her hair?

NICOLE (0.S.)
Seriously. Who’s your stylist?
Helen Keller?

They laugh. Ingrid touches her hair self-consciously.

JENNY (0.S.)
Didn't they send her to an insane
asylum?

NICOLE (0.S.)
Yep. Her sister told everyone she
was at a yoga retreat.

JENNY (0.S.)
So dark.
11.

They disappear around a corner. Ingrid puts her earbuds back
in and heads for the exit, trying not to show any emotion.

MELODY BEATTIE (V.O.)
Today, I will not strike out at
those who cause me pain. TI will
feel my emotions and take
responsibility for them...

I/E. NICOLE’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

A popsicle stick picture frame with a photo of Nicole and her
family dangles from the rearview mirror.

We RACK FOCUS to Ingrid through the windshield as she exits
the drugstore, recognizing Nicole's car.

ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE CAR

Ingrid makes sure no one is watching, then reaches into her

purse and pulls out Erin’s CAR KEY. She drags the key along
the length of Nicole’s car, leaving a jagged white scratch.

I/E. ERIN’S SUV - EVENING

Ingrid is parked in a suburban housing development, eating
gummy worms and staring out the window.

HER POV - A brand-new two-story home. Charlotte and her
husband exit, carrying a wrapped gift and a bottle of wine.
As they get into their car, Charlotte glances over at us --
Ingrid ducks down. She peers over the steering wheel.

HER POV - Charlotte is squinting in our direction. She
whispers to her husband, who looks over at us, alarmed.

Ingrid throws the car into reverse, knocking over a garbage
bin. She jams on the gas and peels off, tires squealing.
INT. BATHROOM - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid is lying in the bathtub, drinking a Corona, wearing a
green face mask and flipping through her copy of Vanity Fair.

She pauses on an article featuring a photo of a confident,
bohemian-looking young woman in faded overalls sitting cross-
legged on her front porch. The headline reads:

MEET TAYLOR SLOANE, YOUR NEWEST GIRL CRUSH
12.
CLOSE on the photo of TAYLOR SLOANE, 29. Her elegant beauty
is offset by an effortless style and laid-back warmth.
CLOSE on Ingrid’s face. Something inside her has shifted.
She is transfixed. Who is this perfect-looking creature?
INT. NURSERY - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
Ingrid is in bed with her phone and a towel around her head.

ON THE SCREEN - She types the name “Taylor Sloane” into the
Instagram search bar. Her handle pops up - @welltaylored.

Ingrid opens Taylor's profile. She has 267K followers.

INGRID
Whoa.

She taps on Taylor’s most recent PHOTO.
CUT TO:
CLASSICAL MUSIC MONTAGE

A PHOTO of Taylor on a beach in Malibu, wearing a halterneck
swimsuit and covering her face with her hands --

A PHOTO of Taylor and Ezra wearing Jean-Luc Godard-inspired
Halloween costumes --

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Pierrot Le Fou? Oui.

We see perfectly-composed PHOTOS of Los Angeles, Joshua Tree,
vintage cars, flower arrangements, whimsically-patterned

wallpaper, Navajo rugs, designer shoes, artisanal cocktails,
restaurants, music festivals, travel, travel, more TRAVEL --

We see VIDEOS of Taylor showing off her house, riding around
Venice on a beach cruiser, being interviewed for Vanity Fair --

THE IMAGES SPEED UP AS WE ZOOM THROUGH THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF
TAYLOR'S LIFE, HER VOICE OVERLAPPING WITH ITSELF, THE IMAGES
CUTTING FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL WE --

CUT TO:
A VIDEO of Taylor on her wedding day in Big Sur. She stands
at the altar wearing a 1930s lace dress and flower crown
across from Ezra who wears a white tux and black felt hat --

VOICE (0.S.)
.-. You may now kiss the bride.

Taylor and Ezra kiss. It’s an incredibly intimate moment.

INT. BATHROOM - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
Ingrid is watching the video in bed, wiping away tears.

ECU: Her thumb presses the ‘Follow’ button.

INT. LIVING ROOM - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid and Logan are on the couch in their pajamas watching
cartoons while Erin makes dinner in the background. Ingrid
scrolls through Taylor’s Instagram on her phone.

ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of an enchilada on top of a plate
emblazoned with the phrase “What are you grateful for?” --

TAYLOR (V.O.)

I Am Grateful for this vegan

enchilada with raw cacao mole
sauce. Praying hands emoji.

Ingrid taps on the ‘Comment’ bubble, thinking of what to say.
We hear INGRID’S VOICE as she types --
14.

INGRID (V.O.)
Damn, girl! That looks yummy.
What’s your email address?

Ingrid pauses. Something doesn’t feel right. She deletes
her comment and tries again.

INGRID (V.O.)
I am SUCH a foodie. Should we be
best friends?
Ingrid frowns. Still not right. She tries again.

INGRID (V.0.)
OMG! Where is this place??

She adds a ‘Licking Lips’ emoji to the end of her comment.
Ingrid smiles. Nailed it. She presses SEND.

Keith enters from the garage, taking off his cop helmet, a
serious look on his face.

KEITH
Hey, Ingrid, can I talk to you for
a second? In private?
Ingrid freezes, looking worried.
CUT TO:
Ingrid and Keith are standing in the hallway, whispering.
KEITH (CONT'D)
Did you stop by Charlotte’s house
yesterday?

INGRID
No.

KEITH
Ingrid. Don’t lie to me.

INGRID
I’m not lying.

KEITH
Should I get Erin in here? Maybe
you'd feel more comfortable telling
her what happened.

Erin appears in the doorway, drying her hands with a towel.
15.

ERIN
Tell me what?

KEITH
I got a call from Charlotte’s
lawyer this morning. Apparently
she saw Ingrid lurking outside her
house last night.

INGRID
(defensive)
I wasn’t lurking. I was just
feeling low and I wanted to see if
she got my letter --

KEITH
You sent her a letter?!

ERIN
Ingrid, why would you do that?!

INGRID
I needed to apologize and let her
know there were no hard feelings.

ERIN
What do you mean no hard feelings?

INGRID
I mean, none of this would’ve
happened if she’d just invited me
to her wedding in the first place.

Keith and Erin stare at Ingrid, dumbfounded.

ERIN
Ingrid, Charlotte didn’t invite you
because you’re not her friend.
She's just a girl we went to high
school with who reached out to you
after Mom died. That’s it!

INGRID
I’m sorry, okay? It won’t happen
again.

ERIN

That is such bullshit!

KEITH
Babe, calm down --
16.

ERIN
No, I can’t do this anymore.
(to Ingrid)
It’s clear you don’t want our help
so you know what? I’m done. Do
whatever you want. This is your
problem, not ours.

Erin storms off. Keith gives Ingrid one last disapproving
glance and exits. Ingrid stands there, looking hurt.
INT. BATHROOM - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ingrid is sitting on the toilet, crying softly to herself.
Her phone BUZZES. She looks down. A new notification.
ON THE SCREEN - Taylor has responded to Ingrid’s comment.
TAYLOR (V.O.)
Cafe Gratitude. It’s the best.

Come check it out next time you’re
in L.A.! Winking face emoji.

 

Ingrid’s expression changes. She smiles, wiping away tears.

INT. NURSERY - ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ingrid is staring at the Vanity Fair profile of Taylor.

HER POV - The caption beneath the photo reads “Taylor and her
dog, Rothko, at home in Venice, California.”

PUNCH IN on the words: “Venice, California."

TIME CUT:
Ingrid opens the bank folder Erin left her and checks her
account balance sheet. We scroll down a page filled with
useless financial jargon until we land on --

“AVAILABLE BALANCE: $91,234.21”

Ingrid stares at the number in disbelief.

INT. BANK - MORNING

Ingrid watches, mesmerized, as $100 bills are spit out of a
counting machine and arranged into neat piles by a BRANCH
MANAGER. One by one, Ingrid places the stacks of money into
her old L.L. Bean backpack.
17.

EXT. ERIN AND KEITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is asleep. A window opens on the top floor and
Ingrid’s backpack is tossed out onto the lawn followed by a
duffel bag. Ingrid climbs out, carefully lowering herself to
the ground. She grabs her bags and runs to a waiting CAB.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. VENICE BEACH - SUNRISE

The Pacific Ocean shimmers under a pink and orange sky, waves
crashing against the shoreline.

We PULL BACK to reveal Ingrid sitting in the sand with her
bags, staring out at the sea. She looks down at her phone.

ON THE SCREEN - Ingrid is creating a new Instagram account.
The cursor blinks in the empty ‘Username’ field. She thinks
for a moment, then types in the words:

INGRID (V.O.)
Ingrid Goes West.

Her new profile POPS UP. A completely blank canvas.

Ingrid raises her phone, snapping a picture of the sunrise.
She pauses, thinking of the perfect caption.

She glances around, her eyes landing on a CORONA AD plastered
to the side of a nearby building, then types:

INGRID (V.O.)
Finally found my beach. Happy face
emoji.

ECU: Ingrid’s thumb presses the ‘Share’ button.

EXT. VENICE STREETS - DAY

QUICK SHOTS of Ingrid pedaling a brand-new beach cruiser
through the streets of Venice, soaking it all in.

She pauses in front of an old Victorian house. There is a
brand-new black pick-up truck parked out front with a Batman
symbol in place of the Toyota emblem. A sign posted in the
yard reads: “AVAILABLE: 1 BR + 1 BATH"
18.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid looks around while the owner, DAN PINTO, 34, rides a
two-wheeled scooter around, talking on his phone and puffing
on a vape pen. He wears a flat-brim hat, an XXL Jordan Bulls
jersey, board shorts and Adidas slides with tube socks.

DAN PINTO
(into phone)
Last night was haywire, dude. You
see that girl I was talking to?
Total smoke show. Bounced her back
to my place for some YouTube and
chill. We were up all night.

Pinto glances over at Ingrid, clearly saying this for her
benefit, but she isn’t paying attention at all.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Nah, we didn’t hook up, but it’s
all good. I’m juggling too many
bitches right now anyway. Gotta
whittle down my body count --

Ingrid clears her throat. Pinto lowers his voice.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Hey listen, I gotta run but hit me
up later if you wanna blaze.
(awkward beat)
Okay, yeah, no worries. Maybe some
other time --
(beat)
Hello...? Jeremy?

Pinto hangs up and turns to Ingrid.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Bad connection.

(extends his hand)
Hey. Dan Pinto.

INGRID
Ingrid.
(confused beat)
Are you the landlord?

DAN PINTO
I don’t really like the term
landlord. Just think of me as the
chill guy who lives next door and
collects rent every month.
19.

INGRID
But... this is your place, right?

DAN PINTO
It’s really more of a side hustle
to keep me cash-positive while I
pursue my true passion.

Pinto hands her a card that reads “DAN PINTO // SCREENWRITER”
in Batman Forever font with all of his social media handles.

INGRID
You write movies?

Pinto nods, exhaling a thick cloud of smoke from his vape.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Anything I’ve seen?

DAN PINTO
You familiar with Batman?

INGRID
Wow. You wrote that?

DAN PINTO

Not exactly. But I am working on a
script for a new installment in the
franchise. It ain’t exactly
“authorized” but my producer Jeremy
used to be Joel Schumacher’s
assistant and he pretty much
guaranteed he'd forward it along
once I finish this new draft.

Ingrid has already stopped listening and is making her way
into the bedroom. Pinto chases after her.

INGRID
How much is this place?

DAN PINTO
All business, huh? C’mon, Ingrid.
(Dr. Evil voice)
Throw me a frickin’ bone here!

Pinto grins, expecting a laugh. Ingrid looks uneasy.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)

(clearing his throat)
It’s, uh, twenty-nine hundred a
month plus two month’s security
deposit. No pets allowed but we
are most certainly 420-friendly.
Pinto offers Ingrid a hit of his vape pen.

Silence.

INGRID
No thanks.

DAN PINTO
Very cool. I'’11 just run a quick
credit check and I’1l also need
some proof of income --

INGRID
Can I pay you in cash?

Pinto seems impressed and a little turned on.

INT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY

20.

The place is a glorified dorm room filled with wall-to-wall
Batman merchandise, framed posters of classic 90s movies like

“The Matrix” and “12 Monkeys” and a giant fish tank.

Pinto watches as Ingrid digs through her backpack, counting
out nine grand in cash on a table littered with weed jars.

DAN PINTO
Don’t take this the wrong way,
but... are you a prostitute?
INGRID
Nope.
DAN PINTO

Drug dealer?

(no response)
‘Cause if you were, my producer
Jeremy has a legit hook-up --

INGRID
I’m not a drug dealer, okay? My
mom died and she left me some money
and I just want to start over.

Pinto takes a solemn drag on his vape pen.

Ingrid hands him the cash.

DAN PINTO
My condolences.

INGRID
Thanks.

He smiles, handing her the keys.
21.

DAN PINTO
Welcome to La La Land, Ingrid.
(pause)
So, uh... what are your plans the

rest of the day? Wanna grab some
In & Out animal-style? My treat.

INGRID
I’m pretty tired but thanks anyway.

Ingrid heads for the door. Pinto calls out after her.
DAN PINTO
If you need help moving, lemme know
and I’1l fire up the Batmobile.

INGRID
Okay! Will do.

Ingrid exits quickly, the screen door slamming behind her.
DAN PINTO
Peace out, roomie!
INT. GUEST HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Ingrid stands inside her empty apartment, looking around
contentedly. Her phone DINGS. A new notification POPS UP:

“@officialdanpinto is now following you.”

Ingrid opens Pinto’s profile. A measly 178 followers. She
taps on his most recent post.

ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of Pinto at Six Flags, crouching and
throwing up double peace signs in front of BATMAN: THE RIDE.

DAN PINTO (V.0.)
Six Flags solo mission. Shit just
got real.

Ingrid frowns. She opens Taylor's page instead, pulling up
her vegan enchilada photo. She taps on the geotag for “Cafe
Gratitude” and a MAP appears showing the exact location.

INT. CAFE GRATITUDE - DAY

Ingrid sits at a table alone. She cranes her neck, looking
around for any sign of Taylor.
22.

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
What’s your biggest emotional
wound?

Ingrid turns. A WAITRESS with a nose ring is smiling at her.

INGRID
I'm sorry?

WAITRESS
That’s our question of the day.

She points to a chalkboard hanging on the wall that reads:
“Today’s Question: What is your biggest emotional wound?”

WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Mine’s my relationship with my dad.
It’s cool if you don’t want to
answer. We have to ask everyone
who comes in. Company policy.

INGRID
Uh... I’m good, thanks.

WAITRESS
In that case, welcome to Gratitude!
My name’s Eden. How can I nourish
you today?

INGRID
I’m meeting a friend of mine for
lunch. Have you seen her?

Ingrid holds up a PHOTO of Taylor on her phone that’s been
cropped to look like an original.

WAITRESS
Taylor Sloane? Yeah, she comes in
all the time. She was just here
like an hour ago.

(confused)
You say you’re meeting her for
lunch?
INGRID
Oh, uh... shoot. I must have
gotten the time wrong.
(quick beat)

Do you remember what she ordered?

CUT TO:
23.

Ingrid sits in front of a plate of yam cauliflower samosas,
concentrating as she takes a birds-eye PHOTO of it.

ON THE SCREEN - Ingrid posts the photo on her Instagram
account. We HEAR her voice as she types out the caption:

INGRID (V.O.)
Well, I made it. Thanks for the
rec @welltaylored! Hashtag I Am
Grateful.

Ingrid taps ‘Share’ and smiles, feeling good about herself.
Ingrid sets down her phone to take her first bite. She
immediately gags, spitting the half-chewed food onto her
plate, drawing stares from some of the other customers.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid sits cross-legged on the floor of her empty apartment,
eating an In-N-Out burger and looking at Instagram.

ON THE SCREEN - A street-style PHOTO of Taylor in front of a
row of surfboards, wearing a linen sack dress, suede boots
and a straw hat, holding a Claire Vivier clutch.
TAYLOR (V.O.)
New @stevenalan threads got me
like... Princess emoji.

EXT. STEVEN ALAN - DAY

Ingrid walks out wearing the exact same outfit as Taylor and
carrying two shopping bags. She looks down at her phone.

ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of Taylor getting a haircut.
TAYLOR (V.O.)
Summer chop courtesy of the lovely
ladies @trimsalon.

INT. TRIM SALON - DAY

Ingrid sits in a chair, scrolling through her phone, as the
stylist applies highlights to her hair with bits of tin foil.

ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of a first edition of Joan Didion’s
The White Album framed next to an Intelligentsia coffee cup.
24.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
“We tell ourselves stories in order
to live.” Joan Didion.

INT. INTELLIGENTSIA COFFEE - DAY

Ingrid is at the coffee bar, hair styled exactly like
Taylor's, sipping a latte and reading a first edition of The
White Album. Her phone DINGS. A notification POPS UP:

“@officialdanpinto has commented on your post.”

ON THE SCREEN - Ingrid swipes on the notification. Her PHOTO
from Cafe Gratitude appears, now with one like from Pinto.

DAN PINTO (V.O.)
Cauliflower samosa game on fleek.
Devil Horns emoji.

Ingrid sighs, disappointed.

INT. CORNER STORE - MORNING

Ingrid is wearing sweats and flip-flops, her hair in a messy
bun, grabbing a sixer of Coronas out of the fridge. As the
door closes, she hears a familiar voice and turns to see --

TAYLOR SLOANE

-- standing at the register, buying a New York Times and
making small talk with the CASHIER.

TAYLOR
-+. I love the feel of ink on
paper. It’s so tactile.

Ingrid turns back around, trying not to freak out. She pulls
out her phone and uses the front-facing camera to check her
appearance then immediately closes it, disgusted.

INGRID

Okay. Relax. Just be cool.

(cheerful voice)
Hey! How are you?! I’m a huge
fan! Fuck...

(beat)
Oh my god! Hi! It’s me! Ingrid!
No! Shut up! Just be yourself...

A MOM pushing a stroller comes around the corner. She sees
Ingrid standing there with her eyes closed, muttering to
herself, and immediately turns the other way.
25.

Ingrid takes a deep breath and turns, opening her eyes. As
she looks at the counter, her expression changes.

HER POV - Taylor is gone.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
Ingrid rushes out of the store looking both ways.

HER POV - We PAN AROUND frantically then ZOOM IN on Taylor,
across the street, walking into a store.

Ingrid is about to cross the street when Pinto cruises by in
his pick-up truck, grinning, music thumping.

DAN PINTO
‘Sup, Ingrid!

Ingrid tries to see past Pinto’s truck, but it’s too big.

INGRID
Get out of the way!

Pinto watches, confused, as Ingrid dashes across the busy
intersection, cars honking as she runs past.

INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

An upscale Venice boutique. Taylor is browsing a table of
knickknacks. Ingrid walks up, eyeing Taylor and pretending
to flip through a coffee table book about bread.

INGRID
Mmmm. This looks so bread.

Ingrid winces, realizing her mistake. Taylor looks up.

TAYLOR
Sorry?

INGRID
I mean good. This bread looks so
good.
(awkward)
Sounds like somebody didn’t have
their coffee this morning!

Ingrid forces a laugh. Taylor smiles politely and looks
away. Ingrid remains frozen, a grin plastered on her face.

INGRID (CONT'D)
I think I'll buy this.
26.

Taylor pretends not to hear her. Ingrid approaches the
register, glancing back at Taylor longingly.

EXT. VENICE STREET - LATER

Taylor is walking with her earbuds plugged in, scrolling
through her phone. In the background, we see Ingrid
following her at a safe distance.

EXT. TAYLOR’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Taylor opens the gate of her beautiful Craftsman house,
checking the mail. There is an Airstream and a vintage
Mercedes in the driveway. A dog YAPS from inside.

Ingrid hides behind a parked car, watching Taylor as she
enters her house. Ingrid pauses, noticing something.

HER POV - Taylor’s dog, ROTHKO, sits at the window, panting.

EXT. TAYLOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Taylor exits, followed by her husband, EZRA O'KEEFE, 33, now
sporting an impressive beard. They hop into Taylor's
Mercedes and she backs out of the driveway.

ANGLE ON - INGRID

She watches them from the shadows of a nearby alleyway,
holding an In-N-Out bag and sucking on a milkshake.

Ingrid tip-toes up to the gate, looking both ways. Rothko
appears at the window, BARKING incessantly. Ingrid crouches
low, hurrying around the side of the house. She tries one of
the windows. Locked. Then another. Also locked.

Ingrid continues around to the back of the house, trying
every window until finally one OPENS revealing a small powder
room. Ingrid tries climbing inside but it’s too small.

ANGLE - INSIDE THE HOUSE

Rothko comes sprinting up to the window with his teeth bared.
Ingrid pulls out a loose hamburger patty, holding it up.

INGRID
Here! Want some?

Rothko stops barking and sits, eyes trained on the patty.
Ingrid dangles the meat inside the window, just out of his
reach. Rothko JUMPS up and down, trying to get at it.
27.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Come on, Rothko. Come on, boy...

Ingrid grabs Rothko mid-jump, pulling him outside.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
ECU: Rothko’s face, barking incessantly.
Ingrid stands above him, desperately trying to placate him.
INGRID
(hissing)
Shh! Please stop barking!
There’s a KNOCK at the front door. Ingrid looks startled.
She grabs Rothko, looking around frantically, placing him in
the cabinet under the sink. She tosses an already-opened bag
of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos inside and shuts the cabinet door.
CUT TO:
The front door opens, revealing Pinto.
DAN PINTO
Hey, sorry to bug you, but... did
you by any chance get a dog?
Ingrid stares at Pinto blankly.

INGRID
Nope.

DAN PINTO
Oh... Really? Maybe it’s the kush
talking but I swear I heard barking
coming from your place.

INGRID
I was watching a movie. About
dogs.

DAN PINTO

Like Beethoven?

INGRID
Yes! Beethoven! Love that movie.

DAN PINTO
What! Me too! Wanna finish it at
my place? We can take my new
bubbler for a test drive.
28.

Before Ingrid can respond, Rothko wanders into the living
room with orange dust all over his face, violently ripping
apart the Cheetos bag. Pinto gives Ingrid a look.

INGRID
My friend asked if I could dog-sit
for a few days.

DAN PINTO
Yeahhhh. Unfortunately, it’s kind
of a “no dog” situation up in here.

INGRID
Totally. It’s not my dog though.

DAN PINTO
Right. The thing is, I’m actually
super allergic to pet dander. One
whiff of that guy and I could go
into anaphylactic shock.

INGRID
It’s only for one night. He won't
come near you, I promise.
(pouty face)
Please?

Pinto looks at Rothko, then back at Ingrid.

DAN PINTO
Well I guess I can let it slide
this one time.

INGRID
Thanks, Dan. You’re the best.

Pinto goes to leave, then quickly turns back around.

DAN PINTO
Oh, by the way, I’m putting
together a little table read for my
script this weekend and I'd love to
have you in the mix.

INGRID
(winces )
Ooh, this weekend? I don’t think I
can.
DAN PINTO

You sure? There’s free sushi.

INGRID
Yeah, no. Sorry.
29.

Awkward beat. Pinto is disappointed but plays it off.

DAN PINTO
Hey, all good. More sushi for me,
right?

Pinto grins, lingering in the doorway. Ingrid raises her

eyebrows, indicating the conversation is over. He takes a
step back and she closes the door, heaving a sigh of relief.

EXT. VENICE STREET - MORNING

ECU: A “MISSING DOG” poster with an artfully-shot photo of
Rothko from Taylor’s Instagram is tacked to a telephone pole.

REVEAL Ingrid staring at the poster. She rips it down and
slips it into her purse, walking away quickly.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid is on the phone, holding the MISSING DOG poster.

EZRA (V.O.)
Hello?

Ingrid freezes. She wasn’t expecting a man’s voice.

INGRID
Um, hi... I’m calling about your
dog? I saw your poster --

EZRA (V.O.)
Oh my God! Rothko! Is he okay?

INGRID
Yeah, he’s totally fine.

Rothko is lying on the floor, chest heaving, surrounded by
empty fast-food wrappers and Cheetos bags.

EZRA (V.O.)
Where do you live? I’11 come by
right now.

Ingrid looks around the empty apartment.

INGRID
Oh, I’m... stuck in traffic. Why
don’t I swing by your place in,
like, twenty minutes?
30.

EZRA (V.O.)
Perfect.

INGRID
Great! See you then.

EZRA (V.O.)
(confused)
Don’t you need the address?

Ingrid silently curses at herself for being so careless.

INGRID
Yep. Ready when you are.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

QUICK SHOTS of Ingrid styling her hair, putting on make-up,
slipping into a brand-new Rachel Comey dress...

EXT. TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid walks up to the front gate with Rothko in one arm and
her Claire Vivier clutch in the other.

The door opens to reveal Taylor, wearing an embroidered white
Mexican peasant dress and Birkenstock sandals.

TAYLOR
Rothko! We missed you!

Rothko leaps out of Ingrid’s arms and runs to Taylor. Ezra
appears behind her, wearing a chambray apron covered in paint
splatters. He leans over, letting Rothko lick his mouth.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Oh my god, thank you! We were so
worried. You have no idea.
(extends her hand)
Hi. I’m Taylor.

CLOSE on Taylor's perfectly-manicured hand. Ingrid stares at
it. She’s been waiting for this moment. Their hands touch.

INGRID
Ingrid.

TAYLOR
This is my husband, Ezra.

EZRA
Hola. Where’d you find him?
31.

INGRID
Oh, just... a few blocks from here.

Ezra inspects Rothko’s eyes, looking concerned.

EZRA
He looks sick. Must have been
eating garbage or something.

TAYLOR
Poor Rothko.
(to Ingrid)
Hang on, before I forget...

Taylor reaches into her Clare Vivier clutch and pulls out her
checkbook. Ezra notices Ingrid’s matching bag and smiles.

EZRA
Hey, you guys have the same purse.

INGRID
(feigning surprise)
Oh my God. So random.

TAYLOR

Should I make it out to cash?
INGRID

Oh, I can’t take your money.
TAYLOR

We insist.
INGRID

I’m just glad he’s okay. Really.

TAYLOR
Are you sure?

EZRA
Why don’t you stay for dinner? Let
us cook for you.

TAYLOR
Yes! I love that idea.

SLOW PUSH IN on Ingrid. She is freaking out on the inside
but trying to play it cool...
32.

INT. TAYLOR'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Taylor and Ezra lead Ingrid through their house. It’s even
more perfect in real life -- Midcentury modern furniture,
color-coordinated bookshelves, macrame plant hangers,
Moroccan rugs, and tons of natural light.

TAYLOR
Can we get you something to drink?

INGRID
I’d love a Corona.

Taylor laughs. Ingrid joins in on a slight delay.

TAYLOR
I think we can do better than that.

EZRA
Taylor makes a killer South Side.

TAYLOR
It’s the same recipe they use at
the 21 Club in Manhattan.

INGRID
(so confused)
Um... sure.

INT. KITCHEN - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid watches as Taylor pours freshly-made cocktails into
copper mugs, adding muddled lime and a sprig of mint.

TAYLOR
Sorry, we've been so stressed about
Rothko that I haven’t had a chance
to run to the farmer’s market.

Ingrid looks over at Ezra, searing a fresh piece of tuna with
a blowtorch. He places the wilted dandelion greens atop the
plate of seared tuna using a pair of tweezers.
EZRA
Hope you don’t mind if we improvise
a little.
Ingrid seems slightly intimidated by how nice everything is.

INGRID
I feel like I’m at a restaurant.

Taylor smiles, handing the finished drink to Ingrid.
33.
TAYLOR
More like Kitchen Nightmares.
Ingrid takes a sip. It’s the best drink she’s ever tasted.

INGRID
Holy shit. This is amazing.

Taylor stares at Ingrid with a flicker of recognition.

TAYLOR
Have we met before?

INGRID
(nervous )
No. Definitely not.

TAYLOR
Huh. Your face looks so familiar.

Awkward silence. Ingrid is desperate to change the subject.
INGRID

You mind if I use your bathroom?
INT. HALLWAY - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY
Ingrid wanders down the hallway towards the bathroom.
She pauses, eyeing a cluster of photos on the wall. Each one
is of Taylor and Ezra in a different desirable location -- on
a beach in Tulum, standing atop Machu Picchu, eating sushi

with Jiro, wearing costumes at Burning Man...

Ingrid leans in closer, noticing a graduation photo of Taylor
and her brother, NICKY, a handsome puckish young dude.

Ingrid notices an open door. She peers through the crack.

HER POV - A bright, minimalist bedroom with a few art pieces
on the walls and even more books and plants. Ingrid scans
the room like a Terminator, taking note of every detail.

INT. BATHROOM - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid turns the faucet on full blast. She throws back the
shower curtain, opens the medicine cabinet and digs through
the trash can, snapping pictures with her phone. Perfume,
shampoo, make-up, candles, feminine hygiene products --
34.

INT. KITCHEN - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Ingrid sits back down. Taylor snaps her finger, realizing.

TAYLOR
I know where I saw you!
(off Ingrid’s look)
The Echo Park Craft Fair! You were
selling those Bolivian clay pots.

INGRID
I actually just moved here a week
ago.

EZRA

Maybe you’re confusing her with one
of your crazy internet fan-girls.

Ingrid tenses up. Taylor touches her arm, reassuringly.

TAYLOR
He’s giving me shit because I
happen to engage with people on
social media like the rest of the
known universe. My husband suffers
from chronic technophobia.

EZRA
That’s not true. I just don’t want
someone forming an opinion of me
based on what kind of shoes I wear
or what I ate for breakfast.

TAYLOR
(teasing)
Here we go...

EZRA
No, wait a second. Let’s ask
Ingrid what she thinks.

Taylor and Ezra both shift their attention to Ingrid. She
pauses, choosing her words carefully.

INGRID
I think you can tell a lot about a
person based on what they like.

TAYLOR
Yes! Thank you. I mean, in an
ideal world we wouldn’t all be so
judgmental but we can’t help
ourselves, so why pretend
otherwise?

(MORE )
35.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
(to Ingrid)
Like with you. I knew I'd like you
the moment I saw you just based on
what you were wearing.

Ingrid smiles, pleased with herself. Ezra shakes his head.

EZRA
I prefer to keep some parts of my
life private, that’s all. I want
my work to speak for itself.

TAYLOR
(proudly)
Ezra’s an artist.

INGRID
What kind of stuff do you do?

INT. GARAGE - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A three-shot of Ingrid standing between Taylor and Ezra,
staring thoughtfully at a painting out of frame.

EZRA
I guess you could label it “pop
art” but I’m not sure yet.

REVERSE SHOT of a wall of canvases featuring Ed Ruscha-style
paintings of popular phrases like “CURRENT MOOD” and “ON
FLEEK” and “I CAN'T EVEN” over classic American landscapes.

INGRID
I love this.

Taylor smiles at Ezra, squeezing his arm encouragingly.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Are any of these for sale?

EZRA
Uh... I mean, not technically --

TAYLOR
(cutting him off)
Yes. Of course they are.

Ingrid approaches a painting that reads “SQUAD GOALS” over an
image of wild horses galloping through a field.

INGRID
How much is this one?
36.

Ezra looks to Taylor for guidance.
EZRA
How much did we say “Squad Goals”
was, babe?

TAYLOR
I think it was twelve hundred?

Taylor and Ezra watch as Ingrid reaches into her clutch and
pulls out a wallet filled with CASH. She counts out twelve
hundred dollars and hands it to a stunned Ezra.
TAYLOR (CONT’D)
(smiles)
I’ll grab the champagne.
EXT. BACKYARD - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ezra is filling Taylor and Ingrid’s glasses with champagne.
TAYLOR
To Ingrid. Rescuer of dogs, patron
of the arts, and all around good
neighbor.

EZRA
Salut!

They all cheers. Ingrid blushes, smiling as she takes a sip.
CUT TO:
VARIOUS SHOTS of Ingrid, Taylor and Ezra hanging out, talking
and laughing, sipping cocktails and smoking cigarettes. For
the first time, Ingrid feels like she’s where she belongs.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - LATER

It's late. Taylor and Ezra are saying goodbye to Ingrid, who
is carrying Ezra’s enormous painting with both hands.

TAYLOR
So great meeting you, Ingrid.

INGRID
Yeah, you too.

Ingrid lingers for a moment, not wanting to leave...

Taylor’s phone BUZZES. She looks at it, frowning.
37.

TAYLOR
Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.

EZRA
What’s wrong?

TAYLOR
Ahna cancelled on me again. I
can’t even deal with her right now.

Ezra rubs Taylor’s back, consoling her.

EZRA
Babe, don’t worry. We'll figure it out.

INGRID
(concerned)
Is everything okay?

Taylor sighs, gesturing to the AIRSTREAM in the driveway.

TAYLOR
We bought that monstrosity at an
estate sale and I’ve been trying to
move it out to our place in Joshua
Tree but my old Mercedes can’t tow
it. My friend has a truck but she
keeps flaking on me --

INGRID
(blurting out)
I have a truck.

Taylor and Ezra look at Ingrid, surprised.

TAYLOR
Oh, no... I couldn’t. You’ve done
so much for us already.

INGRID
No, really. I don’t mind.

EZRA
Great. Problem solved.

Taylor gives Ezra a look, feeling put on the spot. Ingrid
picks up on this, adding:

INGRID
I was actually thinking of going
out there soon anyway. I don’t
really know anyone here yet and you
both seem like nice people.
38.

BEAT. Taylor smiles, warming to the idea.

TAYLOR

Okay, yeah. How’s this Saturday?
INGRID

Perfect!
TAYLOR

Here, I’1l give you my number.
Ingrid hands Taylor her phone. She watches as Taylor punches
in her info, struggling to contain her excitement.
EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid knocks on the door. It opens, revealing a shirtless
and sweaty Pinto. He looks completely caught off-guard.

DAN PINTO
Ingrid! Hey. Sorry, you caught me
in the middle of a workout sesh --

We HEAR the unmistakable sounds of porn emanating from his
laptop. Pinto exits quickly, shutting the door behind him.

INGRID
Is this a bad time?
DAN PINTO
Nope. All good. What’s up?
INGRID
(wincing)

Can I borrow your truck?

DAN PINTO
The Batmobile? Sure thing. Where
we headed? Ikea? Home Depot?

INGRID
I actually need it this Saturday.

DAN PINTO
Ooh, sorry, Ingrid. No can do.
Got my big table read that night.

INGRID
Is there any way I could borrow it
during the day? Without you?

Pinto laughs, then realizes Ingrid isn’t joking.
39.

DAN PINTO
Are you for real?

INGRID
Please? I’11 do anything.

Pinto pauses to consider this, stroking his chin.

DAN PINTO

Well, now that you mention it, one
of my actresses booked a
Nickelodeon show so we’re looking
for someone to fill in as Catwoman.

(grins)
Whaddya say, Ingrid? You ready for
your close-up?

We HOLD on Ingrid as she swallows uncomfortably...

EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY
Pinto is leading Ingrid around his pick-up, all business.

DAN PINTO
No texting and driving. No
smoking. Premium fuel only. Oh,
and there’s a little blind spot on
the passenger side. You’re not
gonna be towing anything, are you?

INGRID
No. Why?

DAN PINTO
Her engine’s been supercharged so
she'll overheat if she’s pulling
too much weight. Guess that’s the
trade-off you gotta make if you
wanna burn rubber, am I right?

Pinto laughs. Ingrid laughs with a slight delay.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Well, that concludes the tutorial.
Just be back here by five on
Saturday and we'll cruise to
Jeremy’s dad’s house for the read.

INGRID
Dan, thank you so much.
40.

DAN PINTO
No worries, Ingrid. Or should I
say... Catwoman?

INGRID

Ingrid’s fine for now.
Pinto puts his arm around her in a friendly but awkward way.

DAN PINTO
It’s funny. I always said I'd
never let anyone else drive the
Batmobile, but... I have a good
feeling about you, Ingrid.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Pinto’s truck flies down the highway with Ingrid behind the
wheel and the Airstream hitched to the back. She attempts to
change lanes and narrowly misses a HONKING SEDAN.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Ingrid drives with both hands gripping the wheel, looking
stressed out. Taylor rides shotgun, scrolling through her
Instagram mentions and firing off replies.

TAYLOR
I can’t believe you've never been
to Joshua Tree. We should swing by
the Integratron for a sound bath.

Ingrid nods, confused. Taylor pulls out a CD case from the
center console, holding up the Batman Forever soundtrack.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Wow. I had no idea you were so
into Batman.

Ingrid laughs uncomfortably. Taylor pops in the CD.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
You would love my brother. He was
obsessed with this movie when we
were kids.

INGRID
You have a brother?

TAYLOR
Nicky. We’re twins, actually.
He’s the best.

(MORE )
41.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)

He’s so funny and, like, genius-
level smart. I keep telling him to
move out here but he and Ezra don’t
really get along.

INGRID
Why’s that?

TAYLOR
Nicky used to be a bit of a party
animal. He had a few brushes with
the law but he’s totally sober now.

A loud CHIME sounds from inside the truck. A RED EMERGENCY
LIGHT flashes on the dashboard.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Yikes. Should we pull over?

Ingrid checks the time on her phone. It’s past noon already.

INGRID
I’m sure it’s nothing.

Ingrid turns up the music but the CHIME is still audible.
TAYLOR
It sounds pretty serious. I/’1l
check the manual.

Taylor pops open the glove and a bunch of crap tumbles out,
including a box of MAGNUM CONDOMS and a baggie of COCAINE.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ, Ingrid!

INGRID
Oh no, those aren’t mine.

Taylor picks up the vehicle registration, reading aloud.

TAYLOR
Who's “Daniel Pinto”?

We HOLD on Ingrid’s face as she thinks of what to say --

EXT. ROY’S MOTEL & CAFE - DAY

Ingrid and Taylor are sitting underneath the iconic sign
while a MECHANIC works on Pinto’s truck in the background.
42.

TAYLOR
I can’t believe you didn’t tell me
you had a boyfriend.

INGRID
It’s not serious or anything.

TAYLOR
How long have you guys been dating?

INGRID
A little over a week?

TAYLOR
And he’s already letting you borrow
his truck? Wow, you move fast.

The mechanic approaches, wiping grease off on his coveralls.

MECHANIC
Car's good to go, ladies. Just
needed to cool down a bit.

TAYLOR
Oh my God, thank you. You’re the
best. Would you mind snapping a
quick picture of us before we go?

Ingrid’s heart skips a beat. Taylor hands the mechanic her
phone and stands next to Ingrid while he lines up the shot.

MECHANIC
Say cheese.

Ingrid smiles wide. Taylor touches her arm, whispering.

TAYLOR
Don’t smile. Here. Put these on.

Taylor gives Ingrid her sunglasses. Ingrid puts them on, her
smile vanishing. They pose while the mechanic snaps a few.

MECHANIC
Okay, I think we got it.

He hands Taylor back her phone. She swipes through the
pictures and frowns, shaking her head.

TAYLOR
Sorry, but would you mind taking a
few more? This time, try framing
it with the two of us in the middle
and the sign right above our heads.
43.

She hands her phone back to the puzzled mechanic.

MECHANIC
Um... sure.

Taylor tries out a series of different poses as the mechanic
steps back and continues snapping, growing impatient.

TAYLOR
(to Ingrid)
Should we do one with a peace sign?

MECHANIC
(annoyed)
Last one!

Taylor flashes a peace sign. Ingrid flashes one too. CLICK.

EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - DAY

A picturesque 1950s-era homestead cabin surrounded by cacti
and desert flowers. The Airstream is parked out front.

Ingrid and Taylor wander around the property, enjoying the
outdoors and sipping fresh-squeezed lemonade from mason jars.

INGRID
This is heaven.

TAYLOR
You should've seen it when we moved
in. It was vile. The inside
smelled like cat urine and the roof
was caving in. Ezra and I did all
the renovations ourselves.

Ingrid nods, impressed. Her phone DINGS.
ON THE SCREEN - A text from Pinto: “Yoooo! Where u at?”

INGRID
Should we head back?

TAYLOR
(laughs )
Are you crazy? We just got here.

Taylor turns to Ingrid with a mischievous smile.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
I have an idea.
44,

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - EVENING

ECU: A fingernail with a tiny palm tree painted on it dips
into the baggie of cocaine.

The truck is parked outside a desert bar called PAPPY &
HARRIET’S. Ingrid watches Taylor do a lady-like bump off her
nail, tipping her head back to sniff the drip like a pro.

INGRID
(alarmed)
Do you do this a lot?

TAYLOR
Not anymore. I went through a
brief coke phase in college but I
haven't done any since Burning Man.
I know Ezra and I may seem like a
couple of old fogies but we still
know how to cut loose every once in
a while. Have you been to Burning
Man? You should totally join our
camp next year.

Taylor rubs her gums as she passes Ingrid the bag of coke.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
I’m so glad we came here, by the
way. Pappy’s is the best. The
crowd's a bit sketchy but they
always have great live music and
the most amazing desert vibes --

Ingrid’s phone DINGS repeatedly from inside her bag.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Um, is everything okay?

Ingrid reaches into her bag and subtly checks her phone.

ON THE SCREEN - Ingrid’s has 13 MISSED CALLS from Pinto and a
series of frantic text messages: “Is everything OK Ingrid?”
“Why aren’t u answering ur phone??!!” “Helloooocc0000."”

INGRID
Just Dan checking up on me.

TAYLOR
That is so sweet. Ezra never texts
me when I’m out of town. His
communication skills are atrocious.

Ingrid’s phone LIGHTS UP with another call from Pinto.
45.
TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Come on, let’s dance!
Taylor hops out. Ingrid hesitates for a beat, then presses
“Decline” and powers her phone OFF. She dips her nail into

the bag of blow and accidentally does a HUGE BUMP as we --

CUT TO:

INT. PAPPY & HARRIET’S - NIGHT

Ingrid and Taylor are at the bar, toasting margaritas.
Taylor holds up her phone, snapping a photo of them together.

CUT TO:
Taylor and Ingrid are on the dance floor. Taylor moves her
body with a sexy confidence, while Ingrid shuffles around
self-consciously, trying to imitate Taylor.

CUT TO:

Ingrid and Taylor are doing Fireball shots by the pool tables
with a group of DRUNK MARINES. Taylor snaps another photo.

CUT TO:

Ingrid, Taylor and the Marines are all on the dance floor.
Ingrid is starting to get loose. One of the Marines tries
grinding with Taylor but Ingrid wedges herself between them.

CUT TO:

Ingrid, Taylor and two of the Marines are crammed inside the
bathroom stall, doing lines. Taylor is talking non-stop
while Ingrid nods, hanging on her every word.

CUT TO:

The Marines have formed a circle, cheering as Taylor and
Ingrid tear up the dance floor. Ingrid lets herself go, her
body erupting into a series of bizarre spasms. Taylor
follows Ingrid’s lead, allowing her own moves to get bigger
and weirder. They jump up and down, sweating and laughing.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT

Ingrid and Taylor are tearing down a desert highway, smoking
cigarettes and singing along to Seal’s “KISS FROM A ROSE”.

We hear HONKS off screen. The Marines from the bar pull up
alongside them in a Jeep, whistling and cat-calling.
46.

TAYLOR
Watch this.

Taylor lifts her shirt and FLASHES the soldiers her breasts.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Spring break! Woo!

The Marines are cheering and HONKING like crazy. Ingrid
turns and lifts her shirt, taking both hands off the wheel.

INGRID
Spring break, bitches!

Taylor looks ahead, eyes widening.

TAYLOR
Ingrid! Look out!

HER POV - A RABBIT is standing in the middle of the road...
Ingrid jerks the wheel, swerving sharply onto the shoulder.

REEEEEEEEEE! The passenger side of the truck SCRAPES loudly
against the guard rail, sparks flying everywhere...

Ingrid SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, all the color draining from her
face. She and Taylor exchange a concerned look.

EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

Pinto’s truck is parked in the driveway with a HUGE SCRATCH
running down the entire passenger side.

Taylor and Ingrid are sitting on the porch, wrapped in Navajo
blankets. They pass a joint back and forth, both coming down
hard. Ingrid stares at the damaged truck.

INGRID
Dan is gonna kill me.

TAYLOR
Relax. It’s just a scratch. You
can buff that right out.

INGRID
What do I say happened?

TAYLOR
Just tell him it was an honest
mistake. He’ll understand. Come
on, don’t let one little scratch
ruin an otherwise perfect night.
47.

INGRID
Yeah, I guess you're right.

Silence. Taylor takes a thoughtful drag and exhales.

TAYLOR
So... what made you wanna move to

L.A.?
Ingrid stares at Taylor, looking hopeful.

INGRID
You really want to know?

TAYLOR
Yeah, why? How bad can it be?

INGRID
Pretty bad.

TAYLOR
Try me.

Ingrid pauses, taking a long drag. She exhales.

INGRID
Well, let’s see. My mom died about
a year ago, so... that happened.
Then my best friend decided not to
invite me to her wedding and we had
this big falling out. And if that
wasn’t enough, my sister sold our
mom’s house behind my back while I
was still living there.

Taylor is staring at Ingrid with a mix of pity and sadness.

TAYLOR
Oh my God. You poor thing.

Ingrid pauses, suddenly feeling self-conscious.

INGRID
Sorry. Am I being too intense?
TAYLOR
No! Not at all. I love how real
you are.
(beat)

Can I tell you a secret?

INGRID
Um, yes! Hello! Spilling my guts
over here...
48.

Taylor laughs, easing the tension.

TAYLOR
Okay. See that house over there?

Taylor points toward a similar-looking HOUSE next door.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)

I’ve been thinking about buying it.

(beat)
I know it sounds crazy, but... I
have this idea of opening a
boutique hotel filled with all of
my favorite things where everything
in it is for sale.

Ingrid stares at Taylor in stoned amazement.

INGRID
That is such a good idea.

TAYLOR
Right? It’s so simple. Basically,
if you see something you like, you
can take it with you and we'll add
it to your bill. It would be like
my Instagram but in real life.

INGRID
Okay. That sounds incredible and
you need to do that right now.

TAYLOR
I'm thinking of calling it...
Desert D’Or.

INGRID
How did you come up with that?

TAYLOR
It’s from this Norman Mailer book.
The Deer Park. I'm obsessed with
it. Promise me you won’t repeat
any of this. I haven’t even told
Ezra about it yet.

INGRID
Why not?

Taylor takes the joint and drags on it, sighing.
49,

TAYLOR
I dunno. Ever since I convinced
him to quit his job and become an
artist full time he’s been kind of
weird about money.

INGRID
(confused)
I thought his paintings were really
popular.

TAYLOR

Oh, they are. Don’t get me wrong,
he’s absurdly talented but he
refuses to self-promote. He thinks
it’s phony or something --

(catching herself)
God, listen to me rambling on like
an insane person. You must think
I’m the worst.

INGRID
Are you kidding? You’re perfect.

Taylor laughs, faux-embarrassed.

TAYLOR
Yeah. Perfectly fucked up.

INGRID
No, I’m serious. You’re by far the
coolest, most interesting person
I've ever met.

Taylor cocks her head to the side, staring at Ingrid as if
she just said something incredibly profound.

TAYLOR
Oh my God. Thank you.

She leans her head on Ingrid’s shoulder.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
You're a good friend, Ingrid.

Ingrid’s heart flutters at the word “friend”. She smiles.

INT. BEDROOM - JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - NIGHT

Taylor is passed out on the couch, fast asleep, while Ingrid
lies next to her, wide awake, watching her. She takes out
her phone, snapping photo after photo of them together.
50.

EXT. TAYLOR’S HOUSE - DAY

Pinto’s truck rolls to a stop in front of the house. Taylor
gives Ingrid a big warm hug. She pauses before she gets out.

TAYLOR
Hey, so... about last night.

INGRID
Oh no, don’t worry about it.

TAYLOR
All that stuff about Ezra --

INGRID
My lips are sealed.

TAYLOR
Thanks. And tell Dan sorry about
the truck. Can’t wait to meet him!

Taylor exits. Ingrid’s smile disappears as reality sets in.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - MINUTES LATER

Ingrid pulls onto her block to see a COP CAR parked outside
of Pinto’s house. Pinto is talking anxiously to a pair of
COPS, gesticulating wildly and chain-vaping his e-cig.

Pinto sees his truck and a look of angry relief washes over
him. He runs over as Ingrid pulls up in front of the house.

DAN PINTO
Ingrid! Where the fuck were you?!

INGRID
I’m so sorry. I can explain.

Ingrid parks the car and jumps out. Pinto turns to the cops.

DAN PINTO
Sorry, fellas. False alarm.

The cops shake their heads and walk back to their car. Pinto
sticks his head inside the truck, sniffing the air.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Were you smoking in here? I
specifically said “No Smoking”!

INGRID
My friend might have had, like, one
cigarette --
51.

DAN PINTO
Your friend...?!

INGRID
My friend Taylor. I told you she
was coming with me.

DAN PINTO
No. You didn’t.

Ingrid nervously watches Pinto make his way around the truck.

INGRID
So... how was the table read?

DAN PINTO
Cancelled, obviously.

Pinto sees the damage and freezes, lowering his vape pen in
shock. Ingrid tries to remain upbeat.

INGRID
You can buff that right out.
(no response)
It was an honest mistake.
(more silence)
Don’t worry, I‘’1l pay for it.

Pinto leans against the truck with his head down, fighting
back tears. He bites his lip, trying to remain gangster.

DAN PINTO

Anything else I should know about?
INGRID

Well... we may have found something

in the glove box --

DAN PINTO
Are you fucking kidding me?!

INGRID
One thing led to another --

DAN PINTO
You stole my coke too?!

The cops, still idling in their car, both look up at Pinto.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Thanks again, officers!

Pinto angles Ingrid away, leading her back to the house.
52.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
I don’t know what to say to you
right now, Ingrid. I trusted you.

INGRID
I said I was sorry!

Pinto looks away, shaking his head.
DAN PINTO

I thought you were Catwoman. Turns

out you were Two-Face all along.
Pinto storms back to his house, SLAMMING the door behind him.
Ingrid stands there, feeling guilty. DING! She looks down
at her phone. A new notification:
“@welltaylored has tagged a photo of you.”

Ingrid opens her Instagram excitedly.

ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of her and Taylor standing under the
Roy’s Motel & Cafe sign, looking like best friends.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Feet on the ground, head in the
sky. Twin Ladies Emoji.

ECU: The photo already has 2,487 ‘Likes’ while the COMMENTS
section is littered with phrases like “Great shot!" and
“beauties” and “#squadgoals” and “Inspiring! !"

CLOSE on Ingrid as an elated smile spreads across her face.

INGRID (V.O.)
Dear Erin.

MUSIC CUE: MOZART’S “EXSULTATE, JUBILATE, K.165”

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

QUICK SHOTS of Ingrid printing out the INSTAGRAM PHOTO of her
and Taylor, cutting it out and sliding the finished image
into a standard-sized photo frame.

INGRID (V.O.)
You're probably wondering what I’ve
been up to the last few weeks.
53.

EXT. VENICE BEACH - MORNING

Ingrid is wearing a brand-new halterneck swimsuit, straw hat
and sunglasses, reading Norman Mailer’s The Deer Park.

INGRID (V.O.)

Well, I decided to take your advice
and give myself a fresh start in
beautiful, sunny Los Angeles.

Her phone BUZZES. She lifts her sunglasses, squinting at it.

ON THE SCREEN - A text from Taylor reads: “Gallery opening
tonight. Wanna come?” Ingrid replies with a Thumbs Up emoji.

EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Through the front window, we see Taylor and Ezra introducing
Ingrid to a bunch of hip L.A. people.

INGRID (V.O.)

L.A. is the best. I found an
amazing house right by the beach
and I can’t believe how nice and
cool everyone is.

 

INT. CAFE GRATITUDE - DAY

Ingrid is having brunch with Taylor and a group of her
girlfriends. Ingrid cracks a joke about their waiter and
everyone laughs. She smiles, feeling a little boost.

INGRID (V.O.)
I’m making a ton of new friends.

INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

Taylor leads Ingrid through the store, helping her pick out
stuff for her apartment. She hands Ingrid a ceramic pendant
lamp, gushing over how amazing it is. Ingrid waits until
Taylor walks away then peeks at the price tag: $1,350.

INGRID (V.O.)

My friend Taylor’s been helping me
explore my creative side, a part of
myself I never knew existed.
54.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

The ceramic pendant lamp now hangs from the ceiling. The
apartment has been transformed into a miniature version of
Taylor's house, with Ezra’s “SQUAD GOALS” painting hanging
prominently on the wall amidst books and hanging plants.

Ingrid holds up her phone, snapping a photo of her space.

INGRID (V.O.)
Lately, I’ve been getting really
into photography.

IN QUICK CUTS we see Ingrid add a filter to the photo, post
it to Instagram, and watch as it starts racking up ‘Likes’.

INGRID (V.O.)
You should follow me on Instagram.
I have almost a thousand followers
and I’m adding new ones every day.

EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid walks up to the front porch, leaving an envelope
labeled “INGRID RENT” on the door mat.

INGRID (V.0.)
I have a boyfriend now too. His
name is Dan and he’s an absurdly
talented screenwriter.

Ingrid walks away, glancing back over her shoulder.

HER POV - Pinto is spying on her from a second-floor window.
He quickly disappears behind the curtain.

INGRID (V.O.)
He’s writing the new Batman movie.
How cool is that?

INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid unzips the L.L. Bean backpack. There is noticeably
less cash than before. Ingrid frowns and quickly zips it
back up, trying not to think about it.

INGRID (V.O.)
Turns out you were right. All it
took was some money and I finally
have the life I always wanted.
55.

EXT. VENICE STREET - DAY
ECU: A letter with no return address drops into a mailbox.

INGRID (V.O.)
With love, always... Ingrid.

Ingrid pedals away on her bike, wearing a light-colored
sundress, a bottle of rosé in her front basket. We hear LOUD
ROCK MUSIC blasting from an approaching car as --

A red Mustang convertible blows through the stop sign just as
Ingrid is crossing the intersection. She swerves, crashing
into a row of trash cans and flipping over the handlebars.

Ingrid sits up just in time to see the driver, a DUDE ina
backwards “Make America Great Again” hat, speeding away.

INGRID
Fucking asshole!

EXT. TAYLOR’S HOUSE - LATER

Ingrid walks up, flustered, her dress covered in dirt. She
pauses, noticing the RED MUSTANG parked in the driveway.

EXT. BACKYARD - TAYLOR’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ingrid enters to see Taylor laying out food on a small table
surrounded by floor pillows. Ezra is crouched in the corner,
flipping through a crate of LPs. Taylor looks up, concerned.

TAYLOR
What happened to you?

INGRID
Some idiot ran a stop sign and
almost killed me.
(re: Mustang)
Whose car is that in the driveway?

The screen door slams 0.S. Ingrid turns to see the DUDE in
the Trump hat (NICKY SLOANE, 29) emerge from the house
wearing Chubbies shorts and a Patagonia fleece, drinking milk
from the carton. Ingrid freezes, instantly recognizing him.

NICKY
God I love L.A. I just saw two
homeless chicks on the street
duking it out bumfight-style.

Nicky notices Ingrid and stares at her, confused.
56.

NICKY (CONT’D)
Who are you?

TAYLOR
Nicky, this is Ingrid. Ingrid,
this is my brother Nicky. He flew
in from Paris this morning without
telling us.

Nicky nods at Ingrid indifferently.

NICKY
‘Sup.

Ingrid flashes Nicky a tight-lipped smile.

INGRID
So nice to meet you. How long are
you in town for?

NICKY
(shrugs )
Haven't decided yet. I figure at
least a few weeks.

EZRA
(looking up, alarmed)
A few weeks?

Taylor smiles, hugging Nicky and leaning on his shoulder.

TAYLOR
Best surprise ever.

CUT TO:

Brunch is underway. Nicky is dominating the conversation,
chain-smoking and drinking La Croix. Taylor is hanging on
his every word while Ezra feigns interest. Ingrid glares at
Nicky, eyes filled with contempt for this unwelcome intruder.

NICKY
-- so I’m in the Ritz lobby minding
my own business, when I happen to
strike up a conversation with this
Chinese billionaire named Bruno.

TAYLOR
(to Ingrid)
Nicky and I took Mandarin in
college.

Nicky says something to Taylor in Mandarin that makes her
CRACK UP. Ezra and Ingrid both watch, feeling excluded.
57.

NICKY

Anyway, next thing I know, we’re at
some random wedding with our shirts
off, having a push-up contest. I’m
winning, obviously, when all of a
sudden the groom’s dad grabs us
from behind and jacks us up by our
throats like he’s Darth Vader or
some shit. So I decide it’s a good
idea to take a swing at him --

EZRA
You were sober during all this?

NICKY
(raises his right hand)

Scout’s honor. Of course the cops
show up and everyone scatters. I
end up hitching a ride to the
airport only to realize I left my
credit card at the hotel. So there
I am, stranded at De Gaulle with my
dick in my hand, when who do I see?

Nicky pulls his eyes into two slits.

NICKY (CONT’D)
Herro, Nicky!

Ingrid blanches. Taylor’s smile fades a little. Ezra looks
like he’s had enough, standing up.

EZRA
Great story, Nicky. If anyone
needs me, I’1l be in my studio.

Ezra walks into the garage, the door slamming behind him.
Nicky rolls his eyes at Taylor, who says nothing. Ingrid
looks between them, uncomfortable.

NICKY
Anyway, this little fucker Bruno is
so grateful to me for showing hima
good time, he buys me a first class
ticket to L.A. I watched twelve
hours of Family Guy and got a hand-
job from some fashion chick named
Harley something or other --

TAYLOR
Harley Chung?!

NICKY
Bingo. That’s the one.
58.

TAYLOR
I’m obsessed with Harley. Her
stuff is the best. She has, like,
over a million followers.

NICKY
We're having dinner tomorrow night
at the Chateau if you wanna join?

TAYLOR
Um, obviously!

Ingrid leans forward, sucking air.

INGRID
Actually, we’re supposed to see
Willy Wonka at the Hollywood
Forever Cemetery tomorrow. I
already bought the tickets, so...

Taylor looks crestfallen.

TAYLOR
Oh yeah... that’s right.

NICKY
Hey, no worries. You guys should
totally go see a forty year old
dogshit kids movie at a cemetery
instead. That sounds way more fun.

Ingrid blushes, feeling embarrassed.

TAYLOR
Don’t be a prick, Nicky.

NICKY
I was joking! I’m sure you can
meet her some other time.

Taylor turns to Ingrid with an apologetic smile.

TAYLOR
Do you mind if I bail? Nicky and I
literally never see each other.
But you should absolutely go
without me. You can bring Dan!

INGRID
(deflated)
Oh, um... yeah, sure --
59.

NICKY
(to Taylor)
Hey, remember that girl from
Andover who looked exactly like
Gene Wilder?

TAYLOR
Oh my God, yes! What a weirdo!

Taylor and Nicky crack up. Ingrid feels left out.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - EVENING

Ingrid is sitting on her couch, sipping a Corona and
scrolling through Instagram when she pauses.

ON THE SCREEN - We see a PHOTO of Taylor, Nicky and HARLEY
CHUNG doing silly poses inside a candy-themed photo booth.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Wonka vibes with @harleychung at
the Hollywood Cemetery tonight.

Ingrid stares at the photo, feeling a torrent of emotions.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - EVENING

A swarm of people are seated on the lawn with chairs and
picnic blankets, eating and drinking. A DJ spins music in
front of a giant mausoleum that doubles as a movie screen.

Ingrid appears, sweaty and out of breath, holding a Navajo
blanket. She frantically scans the crowd for Taylor.

HER POV - Taylor, Ezra and Nicky are sitting in a VIP SECTION
filled with pillows, blankets and ATTRACTIVE L.A. PEOPLE.

INGRID
Hey guys!

They all turn as Ingrid approaches. Taylor looks surprised.

TAYLOR
Ingrid! What are you doing here?

Ingrid is hurt but tries not to show it.

INGRID
Um... I invited you, remember?
60.

TAYLOR
Oh, right! Turns out Harley knows
the guy who runs this and she
hooked us up with VIP passes.

Ingrid stands there, expectantly, for an awkward beat.

INGRID
Is it cool if I sit with you guys?
EZRA
Yeah, totally.
(turning)

Harley, this is our friend, Ingrid.

Nicky’s date, HARLEY CHUNG, 30s, smiles up at her, looking
like a prettier, more polished version of Taylor.

HARLEY CHUNG
Hey. Nice to meet you.

Ingrid nods. Nicky peers over at her, smiling mischievously.

NICKY
What up, Ingrid? Where’s your
imaginary boyfriend?

Taylor punches Nicky’s arm, whispering.

TAYLOR
Stop.
(to Ingrid; explaining)
We were just talking about how we
still haven’t met Dan and Nicky
made a joke about him being your
imaginary boyfriend. It was dumb.

Ingrid forces a laugh, trying to be a good sport about it.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
So... when can we meet him?

INGRID
Oh, Dan’s really busy with work
stuff right now. He’s a writer --

NICKY
(singing)
Oompa loompa doopity doo, I lied
about my boyfriend to you.

Harley laughs. Ingrid’s smile vanishes.
61.

EZRA
You should bring him this weekend.
Harley's house-sitting this rad
place in Malibu.
(to Harley)
I mean, if there’s room, obviously.

NICKY
No no, go ahead, Ezra. Invite
whoever the fuck you want.

HARLEY CHUNG
(to Ingrid)
It’s totally fine. You guys are
more than welcome.
INGRID
(cheery)
Great. Sounds fun!

Just then, a FRAT GUY stumbles by, accidentally spilling beer
all over Harley’s dress without noticing. She gasps.

NICKY
Hey! Watch where you're going,
jackoff!
The frat guy turns, realizing.

FRAT GUY
Oh shit. My bad.

NICKY
You call that an apology?

FRAT GUY
Sorry. Didn’t see you there.

Nicky stands, getting in the guy’s face.

NICKY
Can you see me now?

FRAT GUY
Dude, relax. It was an accident.

Nicky shoves the guy, causing him to stumble backwards.

NICKY
Sorry. Didn’t see you there, dude.

Taylor quickly pulls Nicky away, holding him back.
62.

TAYLOR
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you trying to get arrested
right now?

NICKY
He started it.

A SECURITY GUARD with a clipboard comes lumbering over.

SECURITY GUARD
Is there a problem here?

HARLEY CHUNG
No, no, everything’s fine.

SECURITY GUARD
Can I have everybody’s name please?

HARLEY CHUNG
Harley Chung?
(adding)

I'm friends with John.

SECURITY GUARD
(scanning his list)
Okay, you’re good.
(to Ingrid)
Your name, miss?

INGRID
Ingrid Thorburn?

The security guard scans his list, shaking his head.

SECURITY GUARD
I don’t have you on here.

INGRID
Right, well... I’m not technically
on the list but these are my
friends, so --

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry, but if you’re not on the
list you can’t be here.

Ingrid looks to Taylor, who flashes a conciliatory smile.
TAYLOR

We'll hang this weekend! I/’11 text
you all the info.
63.

Ingrid nods, getting the message. Nicky waves ‘bye-bye’ as
the security guard escorts her out of the VIP area.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY - NIGHT

The screening is underway. Ingrid is sitting alone on the
steps of a mausoleum, looking miserable.

WILLY WONKA (V.O.)
Yes, the danger must be growing,
‘cause the rowers keep on rowing,
and they’re certainly not showing
any signs that they are slowing!

HER POV - Taylor and Harley are sharing a joint while Nicky
cracks jokes. They all laugh, having a blast without Ingrid.

EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY

Pinto glides up on his two-wheeled scooter, rounding the
corner to find Ingrid sitting on his doorstep. He pauses.

INGRID
Hi Dan.

Silence. Pinto looks past Ingrid, avoiding eye contact.

DAN PINTO
What do you want?

INGRID
Nothing. Just wanted to say hey.

DAN PINTO
(long beat)
Hey.

INGRID
I brought you something.

She produces a box from behind her back and hands it to
Pinto. He reluctantly opens it, revealing a mint-condition
Batman Forever varsity bomber jacket. Pinto rolls his eyes.

DAN PINTO
Nice try, Ingrid.

INGRID
What? You don’t like it?
64.

DAN PINTO
Of course I like it. That’s why I
bought one off eBay two years ago.

INGRID
Check the front pocket.

Pinto finds a JAR OF WEED in the pocket. He shakes his head.

DAN PINTO
This is indica. Everybody knows I
only smoke sativa. Besides, a
replacement eight-ball would have
been more appropriate.

INGRID
Look, I’m trying, okay?

DAN PINTO
You did eight grand worth of damage
to my car, Ingrid! Try harder!

INGRID
Fine! You're right! I took
advantage of you and I’m really
sorry! I just wish we could start
over and pretend like none of that
stuff ever happened.

DAN PINTO
(curious)
You mean, like a reboot?

INGRID
Um... Sure.

Pinto nods, considering this. He takes a quick vape hit.

INT. THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A cheesy tiki restaurant with bamboo and faux-Polynesian
tchotchkes everywhere. Pinto and Ingrid are sitting ina
booth wearing matching Batman Forever jackets and sharing a
Flaming Volcano with two straws.

DAN PINTO
I read somewhere that Darren
Aronofsky was attached to direct
Batman: Year One. How sick would
that have been?

Ingrid is clearly bored but trying to seem engaged.
65.
INGRID
Oh my God. So sick.
Pinto leans back, taking in the ambiance.

DAN PINTO
This place is fucking tight.

Ingrid glances around, visibly unimpressed.

INGRID
You come here a lot?

DAN PINTO
I’m what you’d call a regular.
(calling out)
Hey, Cindy! What up, girl?

A waitress (CINDY) walks by. She pauses, confused.

CINDY
Hi. Can I help you?

Silence. Pinto laughs.

DAN PINTO
Cindy, it’s me. Dan Pinto.

CINDY
(awkward beat)
Oh! Right. Well, um... Let me
just finish with this other table
and I’1l be right with you, Don.

DAN PINTO
Dan.

She smiles politely and walks off. A long, painful silence.

INGRID
I’m sure she’s just really busy.

DAN PINTO
Yeah, no, totally.

Pinto sucks on his straw. More silence.

INGRID
Can I ask you something?

DAN PINTO
Go for it.
66.

INGRID
Why do you like Batman so much?

DAN PINTO
Gee, I don’t know. Maybe because
he’s the most dynamic bad-ass in
the history of entertainment?

INGRID
Really? That’s it?

Pinto looks down, uncomfortable.

DAN PINTO
Actually, uh... both my parents
died when I was a kid, so... I
guess I related to him since we're
both orphans.

Ingrid stares at Pinto with newfound sympathy.

INGRID
Oh my God. I’m so sorry. I had no
idea.

DAN PINTO

(shrugs it off)
It’s cool. At the time, I didn’t
really know how to cope so... I
started wearing a Batman mask to
school every day and made the
teachers call me Bruce. The other
kids made fun of me, but I think it
kind of helped me to pretend like
it happened to someone else. Like,
even though I was wearing a mask, I
felt more like myself, you know?

(beat)
What about you?

INGRID
Oh, I don’t really like Batman.

DAN PINTO
No, I mean, how did your mom die?

Ingrid is caught off-guard by Pinto’s sincerity.

INGRID
Heart attack.
(adding)

She drank a lot.
67.

DAN PINTO
Were you guys close?

Ingrid pauses, as if considering this for the first time.

INGRID
Yeah. We were. It felt like I
lost my best friend, you know?

Ingrid shrugs it off, eyes welling with tears. Pinto looks
concerned. He scoots over to Ingrid’s side, consoling her.

INGRID (CONT'D)
(sniffing)

God, listen to me. You must think

I’m the worst.

DAN PINTO
No way. Are you kidding?
(reassuring)

I know I might seem like a cold-
blooded gangster on the outside,
but... I really like you, Ingrid.

Ingrid stares at Pinto like no one has ever said this to her
before. They lock eyes for a long moment, then --

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid and Pinto are having sweaty, alcohol-fueled sex.
Ingrid lies face-down on the bed while Pinto jackhammers her

from behind. He pauses, catching his breath.

DAN PINTO
Wait.

Ingrid looks back at him, confused.

INGRID
What’s wrong?
DAN PINTO
No, nothing, it’s just...
(awkward)

Would you mind calling me Bruce?

INGRID
You want me to call you Bruce?

DAN PINTO
Like Bruce Way--
68.

INGRID
Yeah, no, I got it.
(turns back around)
Fuck me, Bruce.

Pinto resumes thrusting with renewed vigor.

DAN PINTO
Say “Gotham Needs You.”

INGRID
Gotham needs you.

DAN PINTO
Say it like Catwoman.

INGRID
(sexy voice)
Gotham needs you.
(then)
Meow.

DAN PINTO
Oh shit I’m gonna come --

CLOSE on Ingrid’s face turned to the side as Pinto finishes
on her back. She stares longingly at something 0.S.

HER POV - The framed Instagram photo of her and Taylor in
Joshua Tree is propped up on her bedside table.

CUT TO:

Ingrid and Pinto are lying on their backs. Pinto is enjoying
a post-coital vape while Ingrid stares at the ceiling.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
You were really great, by the way.

INGRID
Thanks. So were you.
(awkward)
Hey, so... some friends of mine are

going up to Malibu this weekend if
you wanna come?

Pinto looks conflicted.

DAN PINTO
Man I'd love to, but my producer
Jeremy's getting married in
Martha’s Vineyard this weekend.
69.

INGRID
(surprised)
Oh. Okay. Nevermind then.

Ingrid rolls over on her side. Pinto looks panicked.

DAN PINTO
You know what? Fuck it. I didn’t
feel like schlepping all the way
out there anyway. Count me in.

Ingrid smiles. She turns back, cuddling up to Pinto.

INGRID
You're the best, Dan.

Pinto places his arms around her, stroking her skin.

DAN PINTO
Whaddya say? You ready for round
two? I can feel the Dark Knight
rising...

INGRID
I'm pretty tired actually.

DAN PINTO
(disappointed)
Yeah, no, me too. I’11 just run
and grab my toothbrush.

INGRID
Actually, um... Is it okay if you
don’t sleep over tonight? I have
trouble falling asleep when there's
somebody else in bed with me.

DAN PINTO
Oh. Yeah, no worries.

Ingrid picks up her phone and starts scrolling through her
Instagram. Pinto slips out of bed, getting dressed.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Excited for this weekend.

INGRID
(distracted)
Yep.

Pinto stands there, nodding awkwardly, then quietly heads
out. He pauses at the door, turning back and smiling.
70.

DAN PINTO
Sweet dreams, Ingrid.

INGRID
Goodnight.

Pinto exits. Ingrid sighs, feeling relieved.

EXT. MALIBU HOUSE - DAY

Pinto’s truck pulls up outside a beachfront house in Malibu.
Ingrid jumps out followed by Pinto, who is now dressed
exactly like Ezra in a felt hat, chambray shirt buttoned all
the way, white jeans, and a pair of Red Wings.

INGRID
Hurry up! We’re already late.

DAN PINTO
(tugging his collar)
Do I seriously have to keep this
buttoned up all the way?

INGRID
Yes. It looks better like that.
Don’t be such a baby.

DAN PINTO
(whiny)
I’m not.

They make their way down a footpath towards the beach.

INGRID
Let’s go over some ground rules.
First, I kind of need you to act
like you're my boyfriend.

DAN PINTO
Seriously?

INGRID
It’s a long story and I can’t
really get into it right now but --

DAN PINTO
Ingrid, I get it. You don’t have
to make up some elaborate story to
hide your feelings. It’s obvious
you're into me.

INGRID
Huh?
71.

DAN PINTO
Relax. I’m into you too. Of
course I’ll be your boyfriend.

INGRID
Um... okay, fine, whatever. Rule
number two. No Batman talk.

DAN PINTO
I’m sorry, what?

INGRID
These people don’t care about
superheroes, okay? They care about
stuff that’s actually cool. Like
food and clothes and Joan Didion.

DAN PINTO
(sighing dramatically)
Anything else, your majesty?

INGRID
Yes. Whatever you do, stay away
from Nicky.

DAN PINTO

Who's Nicky?

NICKY (0.S.)
Yo, Thorburn!

They turn to see Nicky walking up from the beach, wearing his
Trump hat and neon swim trunks, carrying a bunch of firewood.

INGRID
(hushed; to Pinto)
Taylor’s brother. He’s a liar and
a drug addict and he’s not to be
trusted under any circumstances.
(to Nicky)
Hey! Sorry, bad traffic --

NICKY
(re: Pinto)
Who’s this fuggin guy?

INGRID

Nicky, this is Dan Pinto.
(no response)

My “imaginary” boyfriend?

Ingrid smiles. Nicky squints at Pinto, trying to place him.
72.

NICKY

Wait... Dan Pinto? From Chicago?
DAN PINTO

Do we know each other?
NICKY

You're Mark Pinto’s son, aren't you?
DAN PINTO

Uh...
NICKY

Get the fuck out! Thorburn, why
didn’t you tell me?

Ingrid looks between Pinto and Nicky with a confused smile.

INGRID
Tell you what?

NICKY
Your boyfriend’s dad runs one of
the biggest hedge funds in the
world. He pulled in over three
hundred mil last year. Dude’s a
fucking Viking.

Ingrid stares at Pinto, who now has a guilty look on his
face. He glances awkwardly up at the sky.

DAN PINTO
Gonna be a scorcher today, huh?

INT. BEDROOM - MALIBU HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid and Pinto are in the middle of a heated argument.
Pinto is wearing Nicky’s hat for some reason.

INGRID
You told me your parents were dead!

DAN PINTO
I'm sorry, okay? I didn’t want you
thinking I was just some spoiled
rich kid.

INGRID
What was all that shit about you
wearing a Batman mask to school?

DAN PINTO
That part was true actually.
73.

INGRID
You're unbelievable.

DAN PINTO
Me? You’re the one dressing me up
like your little twink so you can
impress these hipsters --

There is a KNOCK. Taylor peeks inside, looking concerned.

TAYLOR
Hey. Is everything okay?

Ingrid’s demeanor changes completely. She smiles.

INGRID
Totally! We were just talking
about how incredible this place is.

TAYLOR
Can I grab you guys a drink?

DAN PINTO
Yeah, I’d love one.

TAYLOR
Nicky won’t stop talking about you
by the way. I think somebody might
have a little man crush.

They look out the window to see Nicky building a fire in the
backyard and holding a lit cigar. He glances up at them.

NICKY
Pinto! Get your ass down here! I
got a Cohiba with your name on it!

DAN PINTO
Hell yeah! One sec!

Taylor smiles and exits. Pinto turns back to Ingrid.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
Why did you tell me to stay away
from Nicky? From what I can tell,
he seems like a pretty chill guy.

INGRID
He’s only being nice to you because
of your dad! Can’t you see that?!
74.

DAN PINTO
Oh, right, because there’s no way
he could possibly like me for my
personality. Is that it?

Ingrid sighs, feeling bad.

INGRID
Fine. You can hang out with him if
you want. Just don’t embarrass me.
(re: Trump hat)
Where did you get that hat?

DAN PINTO
Nicky gave it to me.

INGRID
Take it off. Now.

Ingrid glares at Pinto. He sighs, taking it off.

INT. MALIBU HOUSE - LATER

Ingrid comes downstairs to see Taylor and Harley making
dinner in the kitchen. She pauses, eavesdropping.

HARLEY
Nicky tells me you guys have a
place in Joshua Tree.

TAYLOR
Yes! Have you been?

HARLEY
No, but I’m dying to go. I've been
thinking of doing a pop-up out
there for our resort collection.

TAYLOR

Okay, can I tell you a secret?

(beat)
It sounds crazy, but I’ve been
thinking of buying the house next
door to us and turning into a
boutique hotel where everything in
it is for sale. I’m calling it
Desert D’Or.

CLOSE on Ingrid as she overhears this, looking hurt.
HARLEY CHUNG

That’s genius. Would you ever
consider doing a collaboration?
75.

TAYLOR
Yes! We should totally join
forces.

Ingrid steels herself and enters the kitchen, smiling.

INGRID
Hey! Either of you noble humans
need a hand?

Taylor and Harley turn, exchanging a confused look.

TAYLOR
“Noble humans”...?

INGRID
Yeah, you know. The last lines of
Deer Park? You said you were
obsessed with it so I figured I
should read it. So good!

TAYLOR
Oh, cool. Glad you liked it.
(to Harley)

Hey, why don’t you and Nicky come
out next weekend? We’ll take you
to Pappy’s. They have great live
music and the best desert vibes.

Ingrid feels a stab of jealousy. She is about to speak when
Nicky and Pinto enter from outside wearing swim trunks.

NICKY
Who wants to go skinny dipping?!

Nicky pulls down his trunks, revealing a MANGINA. Taylor and
Harley burst out laughing as Nicky prances around the room
like Mick Jagger. Ingrid looks isolated and miserable.

EXT. BEACH - MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

Dinner has ended and everyone is drinking around a crackling
fire. Ingrid takes out her phone, punching in her password.
Feeling eyes on her, she looks up to see Nicky sitting next
to her, glancing over her shoulder. He turns away quickly.

EZRA
I was at some tech start-up the
other day and they had this absurd
art collection... which really
bugged me, you know? Like, what
kind of statement are they trying
to make?

(MORE )
76.

EZRA (CONT'D)
That they, as a company, have good
taste? That’s bullshit. You can’t
just acquire taste. It’s something
you earn, something you cultivate
over years and years --

Nicky looks at Pinto making a jerk-off motion. Pinto laughs.

EZRA (CONT'D)
(annoyed)
Something to add, Nicky?

NICKY
I just don’t think you’d be saying
that if they had one of your
paintings up on their walls.

Ezra pauses, looking flustered.

EZRA
You're missing the point.
(to Taylor)
C’mon, back me up here, babe.
TAYLOR
I mean... I kind of agree with

Nicky. If someone likes what
you're doing and wants to be a part
of it, why does it matter what
their intentions are?

Ezra looks at Taylor, feeling betrayed. He gets up and
quietly trudges off down the beach.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Ezra, come back.

Ezra gives her the finger. Taylor looks embarrassed.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
So, Dan. I hear you're a writer?

DAN PINTO
Screenwriter, actually.

HARLEY
What are you working on?

DAN PINTO
I just finished a draft of my new
feature, but --
INGRID
(cutting him off)
He can’t really talk about it yet.

NICKY
Fuck that Hollywood bullshit.
We're all friends here. Give us
your elevator pitch.

Pinto looks at Ingrid, not sure what to say.

DAN PINTO
Well, it’s kind of a re-imagining
of a classic superhero story.

TAYLOR
Is it Batman?

DAN PINTO
How’d you know?

TAYLOR
Ingrid and I were admiring your CD
collection on our way to J-Tree.

NICKY
I always thought the third movie was
the most underrated.

DAN PINTO
Dude, that’s exactly how I feel!

NICKY
So when can I read this thing?

DAN PINTO
Ehh, it’s sort of a work in
progress. I was supposed to do a
table read a few weeks ago but one
of my actresses flaked on me.

Pinto shoots a pointed look at Ingrid.
NICKY
Let’s do that shit right now. You
have it on you?
DAN PINTO
No, but I can email you guys a PDF
and we can read it off our phones.

Ingrid tenses up.

77.
78.

INGRID
Come on, guys. Do we really want
to be sitting here in this amazing
house just staring at our phones
the whole night?

TAYLOR
Yeah, I’m with Ingrid.

Ingrid smiles, relieved. Harley shrugs.

HARLEY
I dunno. I’ve never acted before.
Could be fun.

TAYLOR
(backpedaling)
I mean, I’m down if everyone else is.

NICKY
Sorry, Thorburn. Majority rules.

Pinto is psyched. Ingrid looks at Taylor, feeling betrayed.
TIME CUT:

A live read of Pinto’s script is underway. Pinto reads the
action aloud while the others follow along on their phones.

DAN PINTO
“Catwoman removes the blade from
his back and does a backflip off of
the roof.”

Pinto looks at Ingrid. She reads her lines aloud:

INGRID
(monotone)
“Sorry, Bruce. If you play with
cats, you’re bound to get
scratched.”

Pinto mouths along to this line, satisfied, as he scrolls.

DAN PINTO

“Batman collapses onto the ground,
clutching his wound. Through the
darkness, we can see blood seeping
out from beneath his cape. As the
camera cranes upward, we see that
the pool of blood has formed into
the shape... of a BAT.”

(dramatic beat)
Fade out.
79.

A long silence. Ingrid glances around, trying to gauge
everyone’s reaction.

NICKY
Holy shit, Pinto.

DAN PINTO
That bad, huh?

INGRID
I told him it needed more work.

NICKY
No. It’s fucking incredible.

DAN PINTO
Come on. Seriously?

TAYLOR
Yeah. That was really good. And I
don’t even like those movies.

HARLEY
Me neither. I feel like I need to
catch my breath. I mean... wow.

Pinto blushes. Ingrid looks completely bewildered.

NICKY
I got one note. You ready for it?

DAN PINTO
Bring it on, brother.

NICKY
You gotta lose the Batman shit.

Pinto’s smile fades. A deafening silence.

DAN PINTO
What? That’s the whole movie.

NICKY
No. Fuck no. This is a movie
about discovering your true
identity in a world where everybody
wears masks. Don’t get me wrong,
that stuff kills, but I’m just
gonna go ahead and assume that you
don’t own the rights to the Batman
franchise.

DAN PINTO
Correct.
80.

NICKY
So just change all the names and
you've got a completely original
script on your hands.
(shrugs )
But hey, what do I know? You’re
the artist. I’m just a fan.

Pinto is scrambling to type all of this into his phone.

DAN PINTO
No, keep going. This is great.

NICKY
I don’t like to talk shop in mixed
company. What do you say we
continue this conversation in
private over some fine Cuban
cigars? Excuse us, ladies.

Nicky leads Pinto away. Taylor looks around, confused.

TAYLOR

Has anyone seen Ezra?
HARLEY

He’s been gone for a while.
TAYLOR

Shit. I'd better go look for him.
HARLEY

I‘1l come with you.
INGRID

(standing)

Me too.

TAYLOR

We should split up actually.
Harley and I’11 look by the beach.
Ingrid, you check the house.

Taylor and Harley walk off together, leaving Ingrid alone.

INT. MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid is walking through the house, knocking on doors and
peering inside.

INGRID
Ezra...? Hello...?
81.

All the rooms are empty. As she heads for the stairs, she
pauses, hearing VOICES coming from a nearby bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid opens the door and freezes. Nicky and Pinto are
hunched over, shirtless, chopping up gorilla fingers of coke
on Pinto’s Batman Forever CD case.

INGRID
What is going on here?!

NICKY
What’s it look like, Thorburn?
Keep your voice down.

Nicky snorts a line, rapidly pumping his fist. Ingrid shoots
Pinto a look, grabbing the bag of coke and holding it up.

INGRID
Is this yours?
DAN PINTO
Yeah, I mean... you guys did so

much in Joshua Tree, I just assumed
you were all huge cokeheads.

Ingrid starts cleaning up all the drug paraphernalia.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

INGRID
Getting rid of this shit.

NICKY
Whoa, whoa, hang on --

INGRID
Do you know what would happen if
your sister found out about this?!

Just then, the door opens, revealing Taylor and Harley.
Ingrid turns, frozen, still holding the bag of coke.

TAYLOR
Seriously, you guys?

NICKY
Pinto and I were just talking about
the script when Ingrid came in and
started racking lines --
82.

INGRID
What?! That is not true!

Taylor shakes her head, disappointed.

TAYLOR
Whatever, Nicky. It’s your life.
If you wanna waste it, be my guest.

Taylor and Harley exit. Nicky makes an ‘eek’ face at Pinto.

INT. MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT
Ingrid comes downstairs, chasing after Taylor.

INGRID
Taylor, wait! I can explain!

TAYLOR
(turning around)
What is there to explain? You knew
Nicky was sober.

INGRID
It was Dan’s! I had no idea!

TAYLOR
Oh, come on, Ingrid. I saw how
much you did that night at Pappy’s.
I was there, okay?

INGRID
Nicky’s lying! I wasn’t doing any!

TAYLOR
Doing hard drugs a couple times a
year is one thing, but every
weekend? Not a good look.

Taylor walks off. Harley consoles her, flashing Ingrid a
look. Ingrid is speechless.

EXT. BEACH - MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid is sitting by herself, smoking a cigarette and staring
out at the ocean, when she notices Ezra perched on a rock,
wearing a towel and drinking wine from the bottle.

INGRID
(squinting)
Ezra...? Is that you?
83.

He ignores her, taking another swig. Ingrid walks over.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Where have you been? We’ve been
looking for you all night.

EZRA
(distant)
I went skinny dipping.

INGRID
By yourself?

Ezra says nothing. Ingrid sits down next to him.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Is everything okay?

EZRA
No. Not really.
(long pause)
Do you ever wish you could just
walk into the ocean and disappear?

Ingrid stares at Ezra, genuinely confused.

INGRID
Why would you say that? Your life
is perfect.

Silence. Ezra stares off into space.

EZRA
Nicky’s right, you know. I’m not an
artist. I’m a fucking charlatan.

INGRID
Hey, come on. Don’t listen to him.
I think your paintings are awesome.

EZRA
Yeah, well... that makes one of
you. So far, you’re my only sale.

INGRID
(confused)
I thought Taylor said they were
really popular.

EZRA
She would say that, wouldn’t she?
Everything's “the best” with her.
You have to try this restaurant.
It’s “the best”.

(MORE )
84.

EZRA (CONT'D)
Have you seen these clothes?
They’re “the best”. It’s
exhausting after a while.

INGRID

Yeah. I know what you mean.

(confessing)
When we were in Joshua Tree she
told me this secret and she said
not to tell anyone, but then I
heard her telling the exact same
thing to Harley earlier tonight.

EZRA
What secret?

Ingrid looks at Ezra, debating whether to tell him or not.

INGRID
Okay, don’t tell her I told you,
but... she wants to buy the house

next door to you guys and turn it
into some hotel-slash-store thing

called... Desert D’Or.
EZRA
(incredulous)

Desert D’Or...?

INGRID
It’s from her favorite book. The
Deer Park. Which fucking sucks by
the way.

Ezra laughs to himself, shaking his head.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Why are you laughing?

EZRA
The Deer Park is my favorite book.
Taylor’s never even read it.

Ingrid considers this. Ezra pauses, looking wistful.

EZRA (CONT'D)
I wish you’d known the old Taylor.
Back when she first moved here.
She didn’t know anyone yet. She
was this total preppie sorority
chick. Her favorite band was
Coldplay, for fuck’s sake.

(faint smile)
(MORE )
85.

EZRA (CONT'D)
It was refreshing how earnest she
was. Kind of like you, actually.

Ingrid seems unsure of how to take this remark. Ezra sighs.

EZRA (CONT'D)
I miss how things used to be. When
it was just the two of us. I miss
having a day job. I miss waking up
and going to the office. I miss
being around people...

More silence. Ingrid places a hand on Ezra’s shoulder.

EZRA (CONT'D)
Sorry to burden you with all of
this, it’s just... Sometimes I
feel like I don’t have anyone I can
talk to about this stuff, you know?

Ezra looks at Ingrid, placing a hand on her thigh.

EZRA (CONT'D)
You're a good listener.

INGRID
(blushing)
Aw, thanks. So are you.

A sweet moment. Ezra smiles at her, his gaze lingering a
beat too long. Ingrid looks down, noticing Ezra’s hand
making its way up her thigh, towards her crotch --

INGRID (CONT'D)
Ezra...

He leans in suddenly, kissing her on the mouth. Ingrid
pauses, stunned, then pushes him away.

INGRID (CONT'D)
What is wrong with you?!

Ezra freezes, looking stunned.

EZRA
I thought this is what you wanted.

INGRID
What?! Why would you think that?!

EZRA
I dunno. Why else would you have
bought one of my shitty paintings?
I’ve seen the way you look at me.
86.

Ingrid stares at Ezra in disbelief then storms off towards
the house. Ezra chases after her, looking scared.

EZRA (CONT'D)
Ingrid, wait! You’re not gonna
tell Taylor about this, are you?

Ezra grabs Ingrid’s arm, pleading with her.

EZRA (CONT'D)
Please don’t tell her. I’m begging
you. She’s all I’ve got.

Ezra’'s face contorts into a sad grimace. He hunches over,
crying softly. Ingrid watches, not sure what to do.

EZRA (CONT'D)
Oh fuck...

(sobbing)
Please don’t tell her. Please.
I‘1l do anything.

We HOLD on Ingrid, an idea dawning on her...

INT. KITCHEN - MALIBU HOUSE - MORNING

Ingrid comes downstairs, rubbing her eyes, to see Taylor
making coffee and cleaning up from the night before.

INGRID
Morning.

TAYLOR
Hey.

INGRID

Did Ezra ever come home last night?
Taylor sighs, wiping her brow.

TAYLOR
Yeah. He and Nicky got in this
huge fight and Ezra told him he
can’t live with us anymore. He was
acting really strange. You didn’t
talk to him, did you?

INGRID
Nope.

TAYLOR
The whole coke thing must've set
him off I guess.

(MORE )
87.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Anyway, Nicky got pissed and made
Harley drive him back at five in
the morning.

INGRID
Oh my God. That’s horrible.
(extends her arms)
Come here.

Taylor leans in for a hug. Ingrid wraps her arms around her.

TAYLOR
I’m sorry I freaked out at you last
night. I was really stressed out
and... I know it wasn’t your fault.

INGRID
No, I’m the one who should be
sorry. I had no idea my boyfriend
was such a loser.

They glance out at the deck, where Pinto is passed out on the
ground wrapped in a Garfield blanket.

INGRID (CONT'D)
So what’s the plan for today?

TAYLOR
Ezra thought he and I could use a
romantic night together so he
booked us a room at the Chateau.
INGRID
(slightly disappointed)
Oh... Okay.

TAYLOR
Maybe we can grab lunch tomorrow?

Ingrid’s face brightens immediately.

INGRID
Great! Sounds good.

Ingrid turns away, a tiny smile forming on her face.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Pinto and Ingrid are driving in hungover silence. Ingrid
unplugs her phone and powers it on. She pauses, frowning.

ON THE SCREEN - The background image is a PHOTO of Nicky
doing the “eat pussy” gesture with his fingers.
88.

Ingrid turns to Pinto, confused.

INGRID
Did you change the background on my
phone?

DAN PINTO

Why would I do that?
Ingrid tries typing in her password but it doesn’t work.

INGRID
I think I have someone’s else's
phone. Can you try calling me?

Pinto dials Ingrid’s number. Waits a beat.

DAN PINTO
Straight to voicemail.

INGRID
(suddenly anxious)
We have to go back.

DAN PINTO
Are you crazy? We’re almost home.

INGRID
Well what the hell am I supposed to
do without my phone, Dan?!

DAN PINTO
I don’t know. Buy a new one?

Ingrid gets an idea. She pulls out Rothko’s MISSING DOG
flyer from her purse. Ingrid grabs Pinto’s phone and dials.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)
(under his breath)
You're welcome...

Ingrid rolls her eyes, turning away.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Hello...?

INGRID
Taylor?! Hey! It’s Ingrid. Have
you seen my phone anywhere? I
think I may have left it there.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Oh no, we found it.
89.

INGRID
You did? Thank God...

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Yeah, Nicky has it. He said he
grabbed it this morning by
accident.

All the blood instantly drains from Ingrid’s face.

INGRID
Nicky...?

TAYLOR (V.O.)

Don’t worry, I gave him your

address. He said he’d be in touch.
(silence)

Hello...?

EXT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY
Ingrid walks up. There is a note taped to the door that
reads: “Mélisse, 8 PM. Love, Nicky :-)"
INT. MELISSE - EVENING
A fancy French restaurant. Ingrid enters to see Nicky seated
at a table with an array of food, talking to a WAITER and
consulting a wine list. He looks up as she approaches.

NICKY

Thorburn! You made it. Have a
seat. You prefer red or white?

INGRID
Uh... I’m good, thanks.
NICKY
No, no. I insist.
(to Waiter)

What’s your most expensive bottle?

WAITER
That would be the ‘82 Chateau
Lafite.

NICKY

And how much is that?

WAITER
Three-thousand nine-hundred, sir.
90.

NICKY
Perfect.

The Waiter scuttles off. Ingrid takes a seat across from
him, watching as Nicky garnishes a plate of oysters.

NICKY (CONT’D)
I don’t know about you but I could
really use a drink right about now.

INGRID
Where’s my phone, Nicky?
NICKY
Phone? What phone?
(quick beat)

Oh, you mean this?
He pulls out Ingrid’s phone from his pocket.

NICKY (CONT’D)
Funny. My sister has the exact
same case. You guys are so similar
it’s almost... creepy.

INGRID
Give it back.

Ingrid reaches for her phone but Nicky yanks it away.

NICKY
I gotta hand it to you, that was a
bold move, convincing Ezra to throw
me out on my ass like that.

INGRID
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.

NICKY

Come on, Thorburn. You might have
my sister fooled but not me.

That’s the thing about Taylor. She
only wants to see the best in
people. Me? I’m the exact
opposite. I knew you were bad news
from the moment I saw you. And now
I have proof.

Ingrid watches as Nicky punches in her password.
91.

NICKY (CONT’D)
It’s amazing how much you can learn
about someone just by looking
through their phone.
(swiping through)
Here's a picture of you with my
sister’s dog. Here’s the inside of
her medicine cabinet. Here’s one of
her sleeping. There’s a lot of
those. But my personal favorite are
the notes. These really kill me.
(reading)
“Taylor’s favorite brunch spots”
“Taylor's favorite books” “Taylor's
favorite music”... This one’s just
called “TAYLOR” and is basically a
list of everything she owns --

INGRID
Look, I’m not a bad person, okay?
I just want to be her friend. Can
I please have my phone back?

Nicky winces, sucking air.

NICKY

Can’t do it, Ingrid. This is just
too good an opportunity to pass up.
You're fucked here no matter what.
So here’s the deal. I’m not gonna
give you your phone back, but... I
would consider renting it to you.
For a nominal fee, of course.

INGRID
(sighs)
How much do you want?

NICKY
You pay me, let’s say... five grand
once a week and I promise not to
tell my sister and everyone else in
L.A. what a fucking loser you are.

INGRID
Once a week? For how long?

NICKY
What do you mean? For however long
you want your friendship with my
sister to continue.

INGRID
I don’t have that kind of money.
92.

NICKY
Sure you do. Disco Dan told me all
about your dead mom and your
backpack full of cash. Makes
sense. How else could someone with
no job afford to drop everything
and move to L.A.

Ingrid swallows, panicking.

INGRID
I can pay you the five grand but
that’s it.

NICKY

This isn’t a negotiation, Ingrid.
Ingrid stares at Nicky, shaking her head in disbelief.
INGRID
Fine. Now can I have my phone
back, please?
Nicky smiles. He slides her phone across the table.
NICKY
I’m staying at the Jolly Roger down
by the marina. Room 237.
The waiter appears, presenting the bottle of expensive wine.
WAITER
Here you are, sir. This is the
Chateau Lafite 1982 --

NICKY
Thanks, boss. I got this.

The waiter leaves the bottle on the table and exits. Nicky
pours a glass and holds it up to his nose, inhaling deeply.

NICKY (CONT’D)
Cheers.

Nicky downs the entire glass. He grabs the bottle of wine
and stands, motioning to all of the half-eaten food.

NICKY (CONT’D)
This one’s on you by the way.

Nicky exits, whistling to himself. We HOLD on Ingrid, eyes
burning with hatred...
93.

EXT. VENICE STREET - NIGHT

Ingrid rides her bike home, looking spun out. She pauses at
a stoplight and stares up at a billboard.

HER POV - A battered woman’s face with the caption, “IF YOU
CAN SEE IT, YOU CAN CHANGE IT. DON’T TURN A BLIND EYE.”

She hears laughter nearby, noticing a group of TEENAGE BOYS
smoking weed at a playground across the street.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
The boys all look up, whispering as Ingrid approaches.

FAT BOY
Can we help you?

INGRID
I‘'1l give one of you two hundred
bucks to punch me in the face.
Silence, then... the boys burst out laughing.

FAT BOY
Yo, get the fuck outta here!

Ingrid pulls out two hundred in cash. The boys get quiet.
INGRID
If you pussies can’t handle it I'll
find someone else.

The boys all shake their heads, muttering to themselves.
Ingrid is about to leave when one the boys steps forward.

TALL BOY
Fuck it. I/’11 do it.

The other boys start shouting and covering their mouths.

OTHER BOYS
Oh shit! Hell yeah!

INGRID
(to Tall Boy)
You ready?

TALL BOY
Let me see that money first.

Ingrid hands him two hundred dollars. One of the other boys
starts filming the whole thing with his cell phone.
94,

INGRID
Hit me as hard as you can. Right
in the face.
The Tall Boy readies himself, having second thoughts.

TALL BOY
You sure about this?

Ingrid nods, closing her eyes. The Tall Boy winds up and
PUNCHES HER RIGHT IN THE FACE...

Ingrid doubles over, clutching her face and moaning. The
Tall Boy feels guilty. He puts his arm on Ingrid’s back.

TALL BOY (CONT’D)
You okay?

Ingrid nods. She stands, revealing her face. It’s bright
red and she has a cut on her nose that is bleeding profusely.

OTHER BOYS
Oh shit! Damn! You got fucked up!

Ingrid gets in the Tall Boy’s face, egging him on.

INGRID
That all you got, bitch?

TALL BOY
(backing away)
Yo, let’s get the fuck out of here.
The boys look disturbed, turning and sprinting away.

PRE-LAP: A fist pounding urgently on a door.

EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
Pinto opens his door, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

DAN PINTO
Ingrid? It’s four in the morning--

His expression falls when he sees Ingrid, now sporting a
prominent shiner under her left eye and crying profusely.
INT. PINTO’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ingrid is on the couch, wrapped in a blanket and sipping a
Monster Energy Drink while Pinto paces back and forth.
95.

INGRID
-- when I got home, I turned on the
lights and Nicky was there waiting
for me. He seemed drunk or on
drugs or something. I asked him
for my phone back but he wouldn’t
give it to me. He said he wanted
fifty thousand dollars.

DAN PINTO
Are you fucking serious right now?!

INGRID
I told him I didn’t have that kind
of cash, but he didn’t believe me.
He said you told him about the
money my mom left me.
(hurt)
Is that true?

Pinto is speechless.

DAN PINTO
I mean... I don’t know! We were so
fucked up! I may have mentioned it
at some point --

INGRID
Dan! Why would you do that?! I
told you how dangerous he was!

DAN PINTO
Fuck it. I’m calling the cops.

Pinto reaches for his phone but Ingrid stops him.

INGRID
No! He said he’d kill me if I told
anyone. Please. You don’t know
what he’s capable of.

DAN PINTO
This is bullshit! We can’t let him
get away with this!
(beat)
You want me to go pound his ass?

INGRID
No, Dan. Believe me, I don’t like
this any more than you do but if
we're going to do something we have
to be smart about it.

Pinto looks at Ingrid, intrigued.
96.

DAN PINTO
What’d you have in mind?

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - NIGHT

Ingrid and Pinto are parked outside of the JOLLY ROGER MOTEL.
Pinto is wearing a trenchcoat and dressed in all black.

DAN PINTO
You really think this'll work?

THEIR POV - Nicky’s red Ford Mustang is parked in the lot.

INGRID
You're asking me this now? After I
just bought a thousand dollars
worth of cocaine? Yes, I’m sure.

DAN PINTO
What if someone sees me?

INGRID
You’1l be in and out in two
minutes. Just break into his car,
plant the drugs, and leave.

Pinto pulls on a BATMAN MASK and picks up a crowbar.
DAN PINTO

(deep breath)
Rock and roll.

EXT. JOLLY ROGER MOTEL - NIGHT

Pinto hops out of his car and zig-zags through the parking
lot, keeping his head low. He pulls out a walkie-talkie.

DAN PINTO
(into walkie talkie)
Ingrid, do you read me? Over.
INTERCUT WITH -- I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
Ingrid speaks into her walkie-talkie.
INGRID
(annoyed)

Yes, Dan. I can hear you.

Pinto arrives at Nicky’s car. He notices Nicky has left his
driver's side window slightly cracked.
97.

DAN PINTO
We got an open window here. I
think I can fit my arm inside so we
should be good to go.

INGRID
Copy that. Great work, Dan.

DAN PINTO
10-4. Commencing radio silence.

CLICK. Pinto switches off his radio.

INGRID
Wait, what? No. Keep your radio
on. Hello? Dan...?!

Ingrid sighs. She puts down the walkie-talkie and picks up
her phone, dialing 9-1-1. The EMERGENCY OPERATOR answers.

EMERGENCY OPERATOR (V.O.)
9-1-1. What’s your emergency?

INGRID
(frantic)
Help! I’m at the Jolly Roger Motel
in Marina Del Rey and there’s a man
dealing drugs out of his car! It’s
a red Ford Mustang convertible!

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
Okay, ma’am, try and stay calm.
What is your name, please?

INGRID
Oh my god, he has a gun! Hurry!

Ingrid hangs up the phone and smiles.

Pinto rolls up his sleeve and squeezes his arm through the
window, tossing the bag of coke onto the driver’s seat.

DAN PINTO
(smiles)
Mission accomplished.

He tries pulling his arm back out but it won’t budge. The
gap is too narrow. He tries again. Still nothing.

Ingrid watches as Pinto struggles to free himself.

INGRID
Use the crowbar!
98.

But Pinto can’t hear her. Ingrid notices something out her
window and her expression falls. She slides down in her
seat, peering over the steering wheel to see --
NICKY
-- walking up with a RANDOM COLLEGE GIRL, drunk and laughing.
Ingrid picks up the walkie-talkie, panicking.
INGRID (CONT'D)
(hissing; into radio)
Dan! Abort! Abort mission!

Not knowing what else to do, Ingrid HONKS the horn.

Nicky pauses, hearing the car horn. He looks around, seeing
Pinto with his arm stuck in the car window.

NICKY
Holy shit. That’s my car, you son
of a bitch!

Nicky starts sprinting towards his car at full speed.
Pinto turns just in time to see Nicky running towards him --

DAN PINTO
Oh shit!

Pinto SMASHES THE WINDOW with the crowbar, freeing his arm,
and takes off in the opposite direction.

Ingrid watches, helpless, as Nicky sprints towards Pinto at
full speed, tackling him onto the pavement.

INGRID
(covering her mouth)
Oh my God!

CLOSE on Nicky as he pulverizes Pinto with a string of
relentless punches. The girl comes running over.

RANDOM COLLEGE GIRL
Stop! You’re gonna kill him!

Nicky pauses, catching his breath. He looks down at Pinto,
unresponsive, the mask still covering his face. Nicky cocks
his head to the side, reaching down to lift up the mask as --

A COP CAR comes barreling around the corner, screeching to a
halt. Nicky turns to see TWO COPS jump out, guns drawn.
99.

COP #1
PUT YOUR HANDS UP! GET ON THE
FUCKING GROUND, ASSHOLE!

Nicky stands, confused, raising his hands in the air. The
COPS run over and forcibly throw Nicky on the ground, cuffing
him from behind. The girl is yelling at them to stop.

One of the cops comes over to Pinto, surveying the damage.
CLOSE on masked Pinto, mouth bloody, a few teeth missing...

COP #2
Jesus Christ.
(into radio)
Send an ambulance, now.

The first cop shines his flashlight through Nicky’s car
window, noticing the bag of coke on the driver's seat.

COP #1
Well, well. What do we have here?

Ingrid quietly slips out of Pinto’s truck, tip-toeing away
from the scene unnoticed.

PRE-LAP: EKG MACHINE BEEPING SFX

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Pinto is lying in a hospital bed, unconscious, wearing a neck
brace, his forehead wrapped in bandages and a tube sticking
out of his mouth. An EKG machine BEEPS continuously.

Ingrid is sitting next to his bed, watching a commercial on
TV for Dominos Cinna Stix. Her phone RINGS. It’s Taylor.

INGRID
(excited)
Hey, girl! What’s up?

TAYLOR (V.O.)
(flatly)
Hey. You called me?

Ingrid reacts to her tone. Her voice seems cold and distant.
INGRID
I was... just checking in. Hadn't
heard from you in a few days so --

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Now’s not really a good time.
100.

INGRID
What’s wrong?

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Nicky’s in jail.

INGRID
Oh my God. Have you talked to him?

TAYLOR (V.O.)
No, not yet.

Ingrid closes her eyes, giving herself a little fist pump.
INGRID
Taylor, I am so sorry. Do you want
to grab a coffee and talk about it?

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Shit, I gotta go. It’s my mom.

INGRID
Okay. Feel better --

CLICK. Ingrid hangs up, feeling uncertain.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - DAY

Ingrid is sitting in Pinto’s truck, wearing the same clothes
from the night before, eating a box of Dominos Cinna Stix.

HER POV - She is parked across the street from Taylor's
house. Taylor’s car is gone and the curtains are drawn.

Ingrid looks at her phone, refreshing her Instagram feed.

ON THE SCREEN - A recent INSTAGRAM PHOTO of Taylor’s Joshua
Tree house with the caption:

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Last minute escape to J Tree. Joni
Mitchell on repeat. Hashtag blue.
I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY
Ingrid is driving at full speed through the desert, blasting
Joni Mitchell’s “Blue” through the speakers.
I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - LATER

Ingrid pulls up outside of Taylor’s house in Joshua Tree.
101.

HER POV - The driveway is empty. No one’s home.

INT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - DAY
We are inside the house looking out through the sliding glass
doors leading out to the patio. Ingrid appears, pressing her
face against the glass and peering inside. She KNOCKS twice.
INGRID
(muffled)
Hello?!
EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - DAY

Ingrid walks up to the Airstream and KNOCKS on the door. She
tries the handle and it opens. She peeks inside.

HER POV - The trailer is empty, its contents undisturbed.
Ingrid sighs, frustrated. She checks her phone again.

ON THE SCREEN - A recent INSTAGRAM PHOTO of Taylor at Pappy &
Harriet’s holding a margarita with the caption:

TAYLOR (V.O.)

It’s five o’clock somewhere.

Umbrella drink emoji.
INT. PAPPY & HARRIET’S - DAY
Ingrid is sitting by herself at the bar, sipping a margarita.
HER POV - Regulars mill about but there’s no sign of Taylor.
Ingrid types out a text message to Taylor on her phone.

INGRID (V.O.)

Hey girl! Saw your Instagram. I’m

actually in Joshua Tree with some

friends for a yoga retreat. Wanna

hang later? Dancing Ladies Emoji.

She hits SEND and downs the rest of her drink.

EXT. ROY’S MOTEL & CAFE - DAY

Ingrid stands in front of the sign, talking on the phone.
102.

INGRID

Hey! It’s Ingrid. I’m at Roy’s
right now. Remember when we took
that picture? So fun.

(awkward beat)
Anyway... just wondering if you got
my text message. Still haven't
heard from you. Hope everything's
okay. Talk to you later!

EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - SUNSET

Ingrid is sitting in their driveway. Her thumb hovers over
Taylor’s name, debating whether or not to call again.

She presses the CALL button. A beat as it rings, then --

EZRA (V.O.)
Hello?

INGRID
Ezra! Hey! Where are you guys?

EZRA (V.O.)
We're at dinner. Why?

INGRID
Oh. Well, I saw on Taylor’s
Instagram that you guys were in
Joshua Tree and I’m actually here
randomly on a yoga retreat so I
thought maybe we could --

EZRA (V.O.)
Ingrid. We’re not in Joshua Tree.

INGRID
You're not?

EZRA (V.O.)

No. We’re in L.A. staying at a
friend’s house. Funny how you just
happened to be there right when
Taylor posted about it.

INGRID
What do you mean?
EZRA
(sighs)
Look, I don’t know how to say this,
but... Taylor doesn’t want to see

you anymore.
Silence.

103.

Ingrid feels a sharp pain in her chest.

INGRID
Ezra, put Taylor on the phone.
EZRA (V.O.)
She doesn’t want to talk to you
either.
INGRID
Okay, well... should I call back
tomorrow?
EZRA (V.O.)

Ingrid. It’s over, okay? Nicky
told us everything. Don’t call us
anymore.

INGRID
Ezra, wait --
(click)
Hello...? Ezra?

The line is dead. We HOLD on Ingrid’s face for a long beat
as she tries to process what just happened...

CUT TO:
Ingrid is on the phone, pacing the driveway.
TAYLOR (V.O.)
Hi, you’ve reached Taylor. Leave a
message. (BEEP)
INGRID
Hey. It’s Ingrid. I just hada
weird call with Ezra and I feel
like we should talk about this. I
don’t know what Nicky said to you
but... he’s lying. The fact is,
he’s a drug addict and he can’t be
trusted, so...
(beat)
Call me back.
(quick beat)
It’s Ingrid.
TIME CUT:

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Hi, you’ve reached Taylor. Leave a
message. (BEEP)
104.

INGRID
Hey! Me again! Still haven't
heard back. I’m starting to worry.
This isn’t like you. Call me!

TIME CUT:
Ingrid is sitting in Pinto’s truck, polishing off a Corona.

TAYLOR (V.O.)
Hi, you’ve reached Taylor. Leave a
message. (BEEP)

INGRID
You think you’re so cool, huh?
(Taylor voice)

Ooh, look at me. I’m Taylor. I
take lots of pictures and my life
is so perfect... NOT. Turns out,
I’m a huge bitch who won't admit
that my brother’s a criminal and my
husband is a sad loser who still
uses a flip-phone. I saved your
dog's life! The least you could do
is pick up your fucking phone!

TIME CUT:
Ingrid is laying on the hood of Pinto’s truck. BEEP.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Hey! Sorry about that last

message. I was just kidding...
Gotcha! I’11 be around for the

next hour or so if you wanna talk --

(beep)
Oh, hang on, you're beeping in.
(perking up)

Hey!

EZRA (V.O.)
Listen, you fucking psycho. If you
don’t stop this shit right fucking
now, I’m calling the fucking cops,
you understand? It’s five in the
fucking morning. Just leave us the
fuck alone!

CLICK. Ingrid looks stunned. She hits redial.

AUTOMATED VOICE (V.O.)
The voice mailbox you are trying to
reach is full and cannot accept new
messages. Goodbye.
105.

Ingrid closes her eyes, breathing heavily.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - MORNING

Ingrid is asleep in the front seat, her hair matted to her
forehead, her lips dry and cracked. A MAIL MAN walks up and
peers through the window. He knocks, startling her awake.

MAIL MAN
(muffled)
You okay, miss? You shouldn’t
sleep in your truck. It’s too hot.

Ingrid squints at the Mail Man, confused and dehydrated.

INGRID
(a whisper)
I’m fine. Thanks.

She starts her car. As Ingrid pulls away, she notices the
empty house next to Taylor and Ezra’s place and stops.

HER POV - There is a “FOR SALE” sign in the front yard with a
photo of a long-haired man in a grey suit and bolo tie.

INT. REALTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Ingrid sits across from the realtor in the photo, GARTH
LAFAYETTE, 60s, long hair, grey suit and bolo tie.

GARTH LAFAYETTE
Which property did you say you were
interested in?

INGRID
22 Flamingo Lane.

GARTH LAFAYETTE
Unfortunately, the couple who lives
next door already made an offer on
that house. I do have a handful of
other properties in that same price
range --

INGRID
I don’t want another property. I
want that one.

Garth looks at her for a beat, puzzled. He chuckles.
106.

GARTH LAFAYETTE
Well, I’m sorry, Miss Thorburn, but
there’s not much I can do. If
you'd like, I can add your name to
a waiting list and we’ll give you a
call if anything changes --

Ingrid places her L.L. Bean backpack on the table, unzipping
it to reveal the last of her cash.

INGRID
It’s all the money I have. Please.

Garth leans back in his chair, scratching his chin.

EXT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - DAY
ECU: The “FOR SALE” sign now has a “SOLD” slapped across it.

Ingrid is unloading her things from Pinto’s truck when she
HEARS a screen-door slam. She looks up to see Taylor
storming across the yard towards her. Ingrid waves, beaming.

INGRID
Hey! There you are! I’ve been
trying to reach you all week --

TAYLOR
I don’t believe this! I
specifically told you I wanted this

house!
INGRID

I bought it for both of us.
TAYLOR

What are you talking about?
INGRID

I figured we could join forces.
TAYLOR

On what?
INGRID

Um, hello? Desert D’Or. Our
little secret, remember?

TAYLOR
My brother is in jail right now
because of you. I can’t believe I
actually thought we were friends.
107.

INGRID
We are friends!

TAYLOR
No, we're not! You’re just some
stranger who found me on Instagram!

INGRID
Okay, I think we’re both feeling a
little emotional right now. Why
don’t we go to Pappy’s, have a
margarita and just talk about this?

Taylor turns to leave.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Taylor, wait!

(beat)
I really didn’t want to have to be
the one to say this but... Ezra

cheated on you.
Taylor turns around, stunned.

TAYLOR
What...?

INGRID
He tried to finger me in Malibu.
He made me promise not to tell you,
but I just don’t want to see you
get hurt.

Taylor backs away. She looks like she’s about to cry.
TAYLOR
You're a fucking liar. Stay the
fuck away from me.
Taylor walks off. Ingrid calls after her.
INGRID
I'll be right here if you need me!

INT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - NIGHT

Ingrid sits on the floor, looking through her back window
with a pair of binoculars, eating popcorn from a bag.

HER POV - Through the back window, we can SEE Taylor and Ezra
having a heated argument. Ezra storms outside, gets into his
car and speeds off. Taylor collapses on the couch, sobbing.
108.

EXT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - MORNING
The door opens. Ingrid steps outside and freezes.

HER POV - Pinto’s truck has been keyed with various curse
words and derogatory terms for the female anatomy.

Ingrid turns, looking back at the house.

A WIDER ANGLE reveals the words “EAT SHIT AND DIE” have also
been spray-painted across the entire front of the house in
the same font that Ezra used in his artwork.

MUSIC CUE: THE LOUVIN BROTHERS “SATAN IS REAL”

INT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - DAY

We TRACK through the living room, revealing the place is a
Grey Gardens-style mess. The house is falling apart and
there are clothes and fast food wrappers strewn around.
Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and swarming with flies.

REVEAL Ingrid sitting on the toilet, talking on the phone.
She has no make-up on, her hair is a mess and she’s wearing a
designer dress covered in food stains.

INGRID
I sent you a check two weeks ago.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT (V.O.)
Unfortunately, your account is
still showing as past due.

INGRID
Look, just give me one more week.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT (V.O.)
Ma’am, this is simply a courtesy
call. If you don’t pay your bill
in the next twenty-four hours we're
going to have to shut off your
electricity. Now, we do offer a
payment plan for customers
experiencing financial hardship --

Ingrid hangs up the phone.

INGRID
Asshole.

She reaches for the toilet paper but the roll is empty. She
sighs, looking around for something she can use.
109.

HER POV - Her vintage copy of Joan Didion’s The White Album
is sitting on the floor.

CUT TO:

Ingrid plunges the toilet, angrily. The book lies open on
the floor, a handful of pages torn out.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY
Ingrid is at the register. A teenage CASHIER rings her up.

CASHIER
Fourteen eighty-six.

Ingrid empties her pockets, dumping a handful of crumpled up
bills and coins on the counter. The cashier watches as she
sifts through. It’s clear that she does not have enough.

CASHIER (CONT'D)
Maybe we can take something off?

Ingrid looks at her items. A six-pack of Corona and a big
thing of toilet paper.

I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Ingrid is driving up to her house when she notices a rental
car parked out front. As she pulls into the driveway, she

sees Erin and Keith are standing in front of the house with
the words “EAT SHIT AND DIE” hanging above them.

EXT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - DAY
Ingrid gets out of the truck with her grocery bag, confused.

INGRID
What are you guys doing here?

ERIN
We hadn’t heard from you. We just
wanted to make sure you were okay.

INGRID
Didn't you get my letter?

ERIN
Yeah, but you haven’t responded to
any of our calls or emails.
110.

INGRID
Things have been pretty crazy.
(quick beat)
How did you find me?

KEITH
Your name popped up on a police
database after you bought this
place.
(re: plastic bag)
What you got there, Ingrid?

INGRID
Just some groceries.

CLOSE on the plastic bag which contains a six-pack of Corona
and nothing else. Ingrid looks uncomfortable.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Come on in. I’11 give you the tour.

Ingrid heads inside. Keith and Erin exchange a look.

INT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - DAY

Ingrid unpacks her “groceries” while Erin and Keith take a
look around, reacting to the squalor.

INGRID
Sorry about the mess. I’ve been
doing all the renovations myself.
(pause)
Can I get you guys anything?

KEITH
I'd love a water.

INGRID
My water’s on the fritz right now.
How ‘bout a Corona instead?

Ingrid pops the tops off of three bottles of Corona and hands
one to Erin and Keith, smiling.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Cheers! Welcome to Cali.
(they clink)
So... how’s Logan?

An uncomfortable silence. Ingrid takes a long swig.

ERIN
Ingrid. We’re worried about you.
111.

INGRID
Why would you be worried about me?

ERIN
Look at this place. Look at how
you're living.

INGRID
You’re the one who told me to start
over.
KEITH
This isn’t what we had in mind.
ERIN
We think you should come home.
INGRID
I am home.
ERIN

Ingrid, this isn’t healthy. The
house is a mess. You’re drinking
beer at eleven A.M. on a Tuesday.
It’s like mom all over again.

INGRID
You know what? We’re done here.
So nice of you to drop by.

ERIN
You need help, Ingrid.
INGRID
Oh, now you want to help me?
ERIN
(confused)

What is that supposed to mean?
INGRID

You didn’t seem so eager to help me

when mom got sick.

Erin looks stunned.

ERIN
That is not fair. I did everything
I could --

INGRID

Bullshit. You did everything you
could for yourself. You’re so
selfish it makes me wanna puke.
112.

ERIN
What did you want me to do? Mom
was a black hole that neither of us
was ever going to fill. So you
know what? I moved on.

INGRID
No, you left me to clean up the
mess. You abandoned us.

ERIN
I didn’t abandon you! I did what I
needed to do for my own sanity!

INGRID
Oh. Now I get it.
(then)
Well if I’m so crazy, then why you
don’t you do us all a favor and
stay the fuck out of my life?

KEITH
(to Erin)
Let’s go. We’re leaving.
Erin stares at Ingrid, eyes welling with tears.

INGRID
You heard me. Get the fuck out.

Keith ushers Erin outside, shaking his head at Ingrid.
We HOLD on Ingrid for a long moment, feeling guilty...

INGRID (CONT'D)
Erin, wait --

She opens the front door in time to see Erin and Keith
pulling away. Ingrid watches them drive off, looking sad.
INT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - NIGHT

Ingrid is sitting in the dark, staring at her phone, her face
illuminated by the light of the screen.

ON THE SCREEN - She is posting an OLD PHOTO of her and her
Mom on Halloween. Ingrid is dressed as Dorothy and her mom
is on the couch, looking frail, dressed as the Wicked Witch.

INGRID (V.O.)
Happy Birthday, Mom. Hashtag TBT.
113.

She is about to hit the ‘SHARE’ button when the screen
suddenly goes blank. The battery icon appears.

INGRID
No no no no no...

She jams her thumb on the home button repeatedly.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Come on. Please.

Ingrid tries plugging the phone into the wall but nothing
happens. She tries one of the light switches. Nothing.

Ingrid collapses onto the floor, moaning. The house is
eerily quiet. A beat, then --

We HEAR voices, music and laughter drifting across the
backyard. Ingrid looks up, peering through the blinds.

HER POV - Taylor is having a Halloween party. The lights are
on and there are people in costumes, drinking and dancing.
EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

A costume party is underway. MUSIC blasts as Ingrid enters
wearing a sheet with eye holes, weaving through the crowd.

She finds an outdoor outlet and plugs in her phone, noticing
a platter of tiny sandwiches on the table next to her. She
grabs one and lifts her sheet, devouring it quickly.

Ingrid stuffs a few more into her pocket and is about to head
for the bar when she hears a familiar voice. She turns.

HER POV - Taylor is standing nearby, dressed as Cher from
Clueless and talking to Harley who is dressed as Dionne.

Ingrid tries to quickly walk past them when someone steps on
her sheet, pulling it off her in one fell swoop. She
scrambles to cover herself when Taylor looks over, confused.

TAYLOR
Ingrid...?

Ingrid covers herself with the sheet, pretending not to hear.

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
Ingrid, I can see you. We all can.

Everyone turns, staring at Ingrid. Ingrid slowly removes the
sheet, trying to play it cool.

INGRID
Hey, Taylor. Happy Halloween.

TAYLOR
What are you doing here? You
weren’t invited.

INGRID
The music was really loud, so... if
you wouldn't mind keeping it down,
I have an important meeting
tomorrow, SO...

TAYLOR
A meeting for what?

INGRID
(sadly)
What the fuck do you care?
A dude starts filming the confrontation with his phone.

Ezra appears from inside, sporting a new short haircut and
moustache and dressed as Bernie from Weekend at Bernie’s.

EZRA
You want me to call the cops?
TAYLOR
It’s fine.
INGRID
(re: Ezra)

You're still with this guy?

TAYLOR
Not that it’s any of your business,
but our marriage is fine. Unlike
you, we’re working through our
issues.

EZRA
I’m ninety days sober.

TAYLOR
(proudly)
Ezra’s a concept designer for
Levis.

INGRID
I know, I saw your Instagram.
Congratulations.
115.

TAYLOR
Go home, Ingrid. People like you
aren’t welcome here.

Ingrid starts to leave then pauses, turning.
INGRID
Ezra told me everything, you know.
How you used to dress like a
sorority girl. How your favorite
band was Coldplay. How when you
moved here you didn’t have any
friends. You were just like me.
Ezra says nothing. Taylor looks at Ingrid with pity.

TAYLOR
I was never like you, Ingrid.

A long, painful silence. Everyone stares down at their feet.

CLOSE on Ingrid, fighting back tears. She nods, taking a
deep breath, steeling herself...

INGRID
If you could keep the music down
I'd really appreciate it.
Ingrid walks back towards her house. She pauses, turning
around. Everyone watches as she walks across the entire
party and unplugs her phone.

INGRID (CONT'D)
Forgot my phone.

Ingrid exits once again. A long beat, then --

Everyone resumes dancing and partying as if nothing happened.
We TRACK with Ingrid as she walks across the desert, the
party continuing behind her, tears running down her cheeks...
INT. 22 FLAMINGO LANE - NIGHT

ECU: A cheap tealight candle being lit with a match.

Ingrid is seated on the floor of her now-spotless living
room, surrounded by lit candles. She stares at her phone.

POV —- THROUGH AN IPHONE CAMERA

We are CLOSE on Ingrid’s face as she presses the red RECORD
button on an Instagram video. She takes a deep breath.
116.

INGRID
They say that friends are the family
you choose, but... What if the
people you choose don’t choose you?
(pause)

I thought moving to L.A. would be
my chance to start over. A chance
to live the life I always wanted --

The video STOPS at the 15-second limit. Ingrid sighs. She
presses ‘Share’ and hits the record button again.

INGRID (CONT'D)
I thought if I made my life seem
perfect and happy, maybe someone
would choose me, but... it didn’t
matter. I guess the problem is me.
The only person who ever chose me
is gone now, so... why even bother?

(pause)

I’m so tired --

The video STOPS recording.

INGRID (CONT'D)
shit!

Ingrid presses ‘Share’ and hits the record button again.

INGRID (CONT'D)
I'm tired of having to pretend to
be something I’m not. I guess the
reason I’m doing this is because I
wanted to show people the real me,
if only this one time. So...

(shrugs )

Here I am.

Silence. Ingrid picks up a bottle of prescription pills and
dumps it into her mouth, washing it down with a Corona and
wincing. She hits the ‘Share’ button and sets down her phone.

Ingrid lies back onto the floor, surrounded by candles, and
presses play on her laptop. Seal’s “KISS FROM A ROSE” plays.

She sets up the framed Instagram photo of her and Taylor and
smiles at it one last time. She leans her head back and
closes her eyes, drifting away, finally at peace...

FADE TO BLACK:
117.

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
Ingrid?

(beat)
Ingrid? Can you hear me?

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
CLOSE on Ingrid’s eyes. After a beat, they flutter open...

HER POV - A NURSE is hovering over us, smiling warmly.

NURSE
There she is.

Ingrid looks down at her body, realizing she is in a hospital
bed. She tries to sit up but the nurse eases her back down.

NURSE (CONT’D)
Whoa, whoa. Slow down, girl.

INGRID

(groggy)
Where’s my phone...?

Ingrid glances around the room. It is filled with FLOWERS,
BALLOONS, CARDS and STUFFED ANIMALS.

INGRID (CONT'D)
(re: gifts)
What’s this?

NURSE
Apparently you’ve got a lot of fans
out there. As a matter of fact,
one of them is here to see you.

Ingrid stares at the nurse, confused.

INGRID
Taylor...?

We HEAR the sound of a motorized wheelchair coming down the
hall. DAN PINTO enters, wearing a halo brace. He smiles.

DAN PINTO
‘Sup, Ingrid!

Ingrid seems disappointed.
NURSE

Dan’s the reason you’re still with
us. You're a lucky girl.
118.

DAN PINTO
I saw your three-part suicide note
on Instagram and called 9-1-1.

Ingrid stares at him, bewildered.

INGRID
You still follow me?

Pinto looks at her as if he doesn’t understand the question.

DAN PINTO
‘Course. You’re my girl, Ingrid.

Ingrid looks touched. Her eyes well up with tears.

NURSE
I’ll leave you two alone.

She smiles at them and exits.

DAN PINTO
Whaddya think of my new wheels?

Pinto spins around in his wheelchair.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)

Turns out getting my neck broken
was the best thing that ever
happened to me. I had so much time
on my hands that I completely
retooled my script. And guess
what?

INGRID
You sold it?

DAN PINTO
Not quite. But people are really
responding to the material. I have
an agent now and I just got staffed
on a TV show. How sick is that?

Ingrid manages a weak smile.
INGRID
That’s great, Dan. I’m really
happy for you.

Pinto frowns, sensing something is not right.
119.

DAN PINTO
Hey. Why so serious?
(smiles)
I know what’1ll cheer you up.

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out INGRID’S PHONE.

Ingrid’s face lights up. She looks at the home screen. Her
notification list is flooded with comments from people on
Instagram. A headline at the top reads:

“You have 27,683 new followers.”
Ingrid stares at the number in disbelief.

DAN PINTO (CONT'D)

Some chick from the Huffington Post

got hold of your suicide vids and

re-posted the shit out of ‘em.

Your face is all over the internet.

You’ve even got your own hashtag.
(beat)

Hashtag... I Am Ingrid.

Ingrid opens up her Instagram. As she scrolls through all
the comments, we HEAR each one being read aloud:

COLLEGE GIRL (V.O.)
We love you, Ingrid!!!

COLLEGE BRO (V.O.)
Stay strong, Ingrid. Flex emoji.

ARGENTINIAN WOMAN (V.O.)
Hello, Ingrid. I’m from Argentina.
I saw your video. I think you are
beautiful inside and outside.

TEENAGE GIRL (V.O.)
I feel like we should be best
friends. Please follow me?

THE VOICES START TO BLEND TOGETHER, WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT
AND PRAISE COMING FASTER AND FASTER...

CLOSE on Ingrid as she feels this outpouring of love from so
Many complete strangers. Her heart swells. Her breath
shortens. Her face scrunches up as tears roll down her
cheeks. A SMILE spreads across Ingrid’s face as we --

CUT TO BLACK.
