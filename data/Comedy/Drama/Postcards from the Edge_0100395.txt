INT. SOUTH AMERICAN AIRPORT 1

WIDE, WIDE SHOT of busy airport PROM HIGH UP. People
busy coming and going, standing in line for inter—
national departing flights. Customs-Passport Control
looms in the center at the end of the hall. _-

We SLOWLY PUSH IN to a ticket counter where three
typically Club Med gals are getting their boarding
passes. The AIRLINE EMPLOYEE hands them their tickets.
She has a heavy South American accent. The THREE WOMEN
have midwestern accents.

AIRLINE EMPLOYEE
Flight 92 to Miami departing Gate
17. After you pass through
Passport Control, you will see it
on your right.

MISS VARLANE
‘(bad Spanish)
Muchos gracias, por favor.

. MISS PETERSON

Vicki, the lady speaks English. Tf
don't know why you talk your lousy
old Spanish to them all the time.

MISS JENNINGS
It's a courtesy, Janet. We're in
their country.

MISS VARLANE
Will you two quit it? You've been
bickering all morning.

MISS JENNINGS
She's just upset because she came
down here to have a romance with a
fiery Latin, and all she got was a
fiery case of dysentery.

 

We FOLLOW the three of them to Passport Control. Three
other passengers waiting in line briefly, coming up to
an OFFICIAL behind a partition they hand their pass~
ports and their tickets to him as they continue
chattering.

he customs official hands Miss Peterson and Miss
Varlane their passports and tickets back. He holds
Mary Jennings.

The SENIOR OFFICER approaches with the other officer in

Miss Jennings?
MARY
Yes?
OFFICIAL ,

Mary Jennings?

MARY
Don't tell me. It's a bad
picture. I know. It was very
last minute and I didn't have time
to do my hair on the side so my
face doesn't look fat.

OFFICIAL
(interrupts)
One moment please.

MARY
Bad luck again, Janet. All these
fiery types seem to be drawn
hopelessly to me, bad passport
picture and all.

MISS PETERSON
Wait a minute, girls -~ what about
me?

SENIOR OFFICER
Mary Jennings?

MARY
That's my name, don't wear it out.

 

MISS VARLANE .. 3
What's the problem, senor? * ~

SENIOR OFFICER
Come with me, please.

MISS PETERSON
Excuse me, sir, but we have a
flight that's just leaving, we're
with a group -~

SENIOR OFFICER
(interrupts)
You two will continue. We must
detain your friend. it is
unavoidable.
{to Mary)
Follow me, please.

Mary follows him, continuing to talk:

MARY
Well, girls, you know how I can't
resist a man in uniform. See you
on board.

Mary follows the Officer through a few other passen~ 2
gers en route to their flights, through a doorway
marked Security in English and Spanish -- and down a
hall.

MARY

(continuing)
Wait'll I tell my students back
home about this. They think
nothing ever happens to me. Well,
look at me now. No, seriously,
what is the problem? ‘Cause I
don't want to miss this flight. I
have a special rate. Excursion
rates, they're called.

SENIOR OFFICER
{interrupts)
This way please.

He ushers her into a room where two officers stand 3
behind a table, waiting. On the table is an open suit-
case. Mary looks at the suitcase and then the two

men. The Senior Officer closes the door behind her.

MARY
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
What the heck is going on here,
boys? Wait a minute, wait a
goddamn minute -~ Is this some
kind of Candid Camera thing?
Huh? Where's the camera?

She looks around the room.

SENIOR OFFICER
Shut up.

MARY
I beg your pardon?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SENIOR OFFICER
I said shut up. This is your
suitcase, is it not?

MARY
Why, yes, I believe it is. ‘Those
look like my old chinos -- with _-

the rosebuds -~

SENIOR OFFICER
Then can you please explain how
this came into your possession?

The O£ficer holds aloft a piece of microfiim concealed
in a bra.

MARY
Doesn't look like anything of
Mine, although I'm such a sloppy
packer, I'm not surprised at
anything -~

The Senior Officer slaps Mary hard, sending her halfway
across the room where she lands with her head down -~

SENIOR OFFICER
Did you think that your affair
with a government official would
go unnoticed? We are not fools,
Miss DuBois.

Mary slowly turns her head, regarding the Officer
steadily. Her lip is bleeding. Her demeanor is com-
pletely transformed. She is no longer a midwestern
Carol Burnett dingbat, but Marianne DuBois, heroic
political mole.

MARIANNE
That's your best evidence for not
being foolish? You wish you were
foolish -- foolish should be a
goal of yours. But you're not
even a fool; you're nothing more
than a thug, a second-rate thug.

The Officer starts toward Marianne as if to strike her
again.

MARIANNE
{continuing)
Go ahead, hit me. But we will
survive. We have more spirit and
more resources than you.

MARIANNE (CONT'D)
All it'll cost us is money, while
you... there isn't enough mommy in
the world to further a cause like
yours --

Marianne pauses. A look of consternation flashes
across her face. One of the guards starts to break,
eausing the Senior Officer to blow. Finally Marianne
starts laughing.

MARIANNE/SUZANNE
Fuck... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
MALE VOICE
Cut!
SUZANNE
(laughing)

You shut up, Raoul! All you have
to say is...

(imitates him)
we. come with me please -- this is
your suitcase, is it not? You'd
want your mommy too if you had to
say all that.

A bearded man walks INTO THE SHOT and walks over to
Suzanne. This is the director, LOWELL.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
I'm sorry, Lowell ~- can you use
any of it? No, of course you
can't; there are no cutaways. You
hate me now, don't you?

LOWELL
Don't be silly. It was terrific
up to that point.

SUZANNE
I told you, you should never give
me inches of talk. One inch at
the most, but inches and inches --
it's like a nightmare.

LOWELL
You're one of the few actresses I
know that doesn't like acting.
And you're so good at it.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

The crew has started wandering around. Suzanne
invisibly signals her stand-in, a girl barely notice-
able, standing by a camera.

SUZANNE
I don't like acting as much as I
like hanging around sets. -

LOWELL
You should be a grip.

SUZANNE
I would but I don’t like beer.
Speaking of which, can I go to the
men's room before we start again?

LOWELL
You bet.

FIRST A.D.
Everybody get back to one. We're
going again.

The SOUNDMAN comes and checks Suzanne's body mike as
she talks to Lowell.

SOUNDMAN
fry not to hit your chest when you
do that last speech, Suzanne.

SUZANNE
Listen, Jerry, I'm lucky to get
through that speech at all -~ if Tf
have to hit my chest to do it,
forgive me.

The Soundman with Suzanne looks at another soundman
seated behind a recorder who is laughing at what
Suzanne is saying. We hear the last part of her
dialogue through his headphones ("cans").

SUZANNE
{continuing)
You'd hit my chest too if you had
this speech.

Hair and makeup come to touch Suzanne up.
ROBBY (FIRST A.D.)
Let's go, people -- work with us
-~ get back to your marks as
quickly and quietly as possible.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (4)

Lowell has gone over to the video TV and is watching
the take on video.

SUZANNE

(to hair and makeup)
Maybe 1 shouldn't go to the
bathroom. Maybe I should somehow
use it in the scene -- No, really,
I could play it as though Marianne
had to go to the bathroom -~ aside
from everything else, it would
play much faster. I don't know,
maybe I'm still in character.
Sometimes I can't tell.

MAKEUP
(smiling, shaking
his head)
Wacko. Definitely wacko.

SUZANNE
I'll be right back.

Suzanne makes her way through the crew regrouping for
the next shot.

CAMERAMAN
Re-load!
SUZANNE
You can say that again.
CAMERAMAN
i probably will after the next
shot.
SUZANNE
Only if I make it all the way
through.

Suzanne is very popular with the crew. They clearly
like her and think she's funny.

Suzanne slips into the ladies' room. The door closes
and an instant later, her stand-in slips out.

We GO BACK to the soundman with the headphones around
his neck. Through them we hear someone snorting
cocaine. Both soundmen look at each other knowingly.
One puts a finger up to his nose. He hears the SOUND
of a TOILET FLUSHING THROUGH the HEADPHONES.

Lowell is directing the Senior Officer.

LOWELL
It was very good, Raoul. This
time, you know, when you Say Miss
DuBois -- try not to punch it
quite as hard. Be more victorious
with your discovery than ominous.
You're plenty ominous as it is. -
RAQUL
Yes, sir.

Suzanne re-emerges from the bathroom.

SUZANNE
Is the airplane in this shot ~~ or
are you just glad to see me? i'm
coming, I'm coming.
(she subtly wipes
her nose)
Show business is my life -~

A blood ampule is thrust deep into her mouth.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
-- and boy, are my arms tired.
Where's my plane ticket?

FIRST A.D.

Charlie, props!

LOWELL

T£ you fuck up my movie, I'll kill

you.
SUZANNE
(blankly)
Whaa -- ?
LOWELL

(interrupts, angry}
You know exactly what I mean. And
so does everybody else on this
set. I don't care what you do to
your body on your time. But this
is my time. My movie. I care
about what I do. I work very hard
to get good resuits and I don't
intend to let some spoiled,
selfish, coked up little actress
ruin my movie.

LOWELL (CONT'D)
Now, there are a lot of people
here trying to work together to
make this a good movie. I expect
you to pull yourself together for
these last couple of days on this
film and work with us or... I'll
kill you. I'll kill you before
you kill yourself. And I'll doa
better job ‘cause you're so out of
it you'd probably even botch that
up. Now, do you think you can do
the scene straight through this
time?

Suzanne just looks at him, humiliated and dumbfounded.

LOWELL

(continuing)
Try to use the humiliation in the
scene, it'll give you more depth.
Use your vulnerability instead o£
making jokes to cover it up. Or
taking drugs. One more hit of
cocaine on this picture and I'm
going to make sure that everyone
in this town who doesn't already
know, knows what a fuck up you
are. I'll ruin you forever. And
then I'11 kill you.

 

Suzanne nods the smallest of nods.

Okay, everybody, back to one,
we'll give it another try.

Hey, slugabed -- it's almost

He shakes her.

JACK
(continuing)
Yoohoo -- Sleeping Beauty. What's
the name of the man that slept for
a hundred years -- Rapunzel?
No. Rip Van Winkle -~ Mrs.
Winkle, this is your wake-up call.

Jack now looks concerned, to the degree that he can.
It’s clear that something is wrong. Jack turns Suzanne
on her back. Her head flops back. She is unconscious.

JACK
(continuing)
Oh, great. Fabulous. Suzanne!
Oh please don't be dead. I don't

He checks for her pulse on her wrist -- her neck.

Oh, God.

Suzanne has been wrapped in a blanket. Her clothes and
her purse are ina pile on her lap.

JACK
Never date actresses. Never date
actresses.

Jack drives his car into the emergency room parking
lot. There is an ATTENDANT in the booth.

JACK

Delivery.

ATTENDANT
Excuse me?

JACK

ATTENDANT
Yes.

JACK
Well, this is an emergency!

7 INT. CEDARS-SINAI LOADING ZONE ~ A PEW MINUTES LATER 7

Suzanne is being loaded into a wheelchair by two
nurses. A DOCTOR has a clipboard.

DOCTOR
Are you a relation of the patient?

JACK
No. No relation. I barely know
her. I found her like this and
brought her here. Will she be all
right?

Jack is walking backwards to his car.

DOCTOR
I don't know, sir. Where can we
reach you?

JACK
I'll call you, okay? There's some
empty bottles of pills in her bag
-- that's probably what she
took. Thanks!

Jack dives into his car. As he slams the car door, we
hear a THUD. It is:

INT. HOSPITAL 8
A hospital door being pushed open. We see:

A very bright fluorescent light being shined in
Suzanne's unconscious face. One of her eyelids is
drawn open. A light is shined into it. Her pupil
doesn't really react.

DOCTOR
Any idea what she's taken?

NURSE
Pills, sir, as far as we know.
Percodan, Placidil and alcohol.

Suzanne's blood pressure is taken. We see the cuff
strapped to her arm.

DOCTOR
{loud)
Suzannet

Suzanne doesn't respond.

pocTOR
(continuing; louder)
Suzanne!

Suzanne, unconscious, tries from deep within her to
become conscious.

fhe Doctor slaps her hard across her face, Suzanne
reacts. She mumbles.

DOCTOR
(continuing)
What's she saying?

SUZANNE
(slurred)
That's your best evidence for not
being foolish? Foolish should be
a goal of yours.

Her speech from her fine political torture film.

NURSE
Something about being foolish.

DOCTOR
She can say that again.
(loudly, to Suzanne)
Suzanne! We're going to have to
pump your stomach.

Suzanne almost opens her eyes, focusing briefly on the

Doctor.

SUZANNE
Do I have to be there?

An oxygen mask is put to her face. Life indicating
suctions (EKG wires) are stuck on her to monitor her

vital signs.
The Doctor reaches for a hose.

Suzanne is being held down by a nurse. A black,
Chalkish fluid is forced down her. Moments later
hear her throwing up.

NURSE
Funny. I just rented the video of
"Mist on the Lake."

We see Suzanne's vital signs. They are low. Her
heartbeat slow.

The Doctor's hand brings the hose into Suzanne's face.

NURSE
(continuing)
She had french fries for dinner, t

DOCTOR

And some kind of meat product.
And a pickle.

They begin to insert the hose into her nose.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY 10

A woman is running down the hallway, wailing, every~
thing flying -~ purse, wig askew, blouse untucked,
false eyelashes removed. Clearly this woman was caught
mid-something for the apparent emergency. She is DORIS
MANN, about 60, formerly beautiful and more than some-
what currently. She was an enormous star in the 50's
and 60's and bears that mark. o

She is currently very upset, theatrically so. Cutting
a wide swath as she makes her way down the hall --
things dropping out of her purse, mostly makeup ~- a
pack of cigarettes. People watch her as she moves by
moving aside to avoid impact. Doris Mann is very up-
set. Perhaps she has lost a shoe.

DORIS
My baby, my baby.

She is breathless.
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM ~ SEVERAL HOURS LATER 1z

Suzanne is unconscious following her procedure. She is
still being monitored. An IV runs into her arm.

Suzanne's mother, Doris Mann, has flung herself across
her daughter's inert form.

There is something childlike about Doris at the same
time as she is theatrical. She is far from a monster
as many stars from her generation have been depicted.
She is tough, but at the same time, touching, almost
adorable. She is a product of complete self-invention.
Dirt poor to rich and famous. Though the following has
a touch of theatricality about it, almost as though
"done" for the two nurses ~~ there should be no doubt
about Doris' sincere feelings and concern for Suzanne.

Several NURSES try to comfort her.

NURSE A
She's resting comfortably, Miss
Mann. She should be (fine).

DORIS

(not hearing,

interrupting)
How did this happen? I was a good
mother. I had my career, but I
was there. She had a happy
childhood. I can prove it -- I
have films.

here?

NURSE A
No.

DORIS
Of course not, He's not here,
that's why. I’mhere. That's
who. Me. Her mother.
(goes to tuck
Suzanne in)
At least she's sleeping now.
(to Suzanne)
You never could sleep, could you?
(kisses her)
That's my girl.

SUZANNE'S DREAM 12

Suzanne is wandering down a hospital hallway. There
are pictures on the wall. Marilyn Monroe, Lenny Bruce,
Elvis Presley, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland, Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin, John Belushi, Jim Morrison. She
regards them curiously. Suddenly she sees the nurses'
station. It is empty. She looks around to make sure
the coast is clear then makes her way to an enormous
medicine cabinet, which she carefully opens. It is
filled with pills. She starts dumping them into her
hands -- but then she looks down and her hospital gown
has no pockets to put the pills in. She panics that
gomeone is coming. A woman rounds the corner, catching
Suzanne in the act. The woman is Nancy Reagan.

INT. SUZANNE'S HOSPITAL ROOM 13

Suzanne wakes up, horrified, sweating from her drean.
A therapist, JULIE, is standing at the edge of her
bed. She is middle-aged, dressed rather youthfully,
with dark hair and very long red nails. She smokes
Lucky Strikes. She is the queen bee in this rehabili-
tation hive. She carries a pad and pencil.

JOLIE
Nasty dream? Everybody has those.
You'll have them for a while.

JULIE ~"
(briskly)
I'm Julie Marsden, Director of the
Dawn o£ New Hope Rehabilitation
Program. I'm here to admit you.

SUZANNE
Nice to meet you.

JULIE
Your blood work was done up in the
emergency room the other night.
Since you've been basically
sleeping since then —— we're going
to have to find out a couple of
things before we officially admit
you to the unit.

SUZANNE
Shoot.

JULIE
All right, we'll start.

She refers to her notes on a clipboard, as she sits in
a chair at the end of Suzanne's bed.

JULIE

(continuing)
Approximately how long have you
been a drug addict?

Suzanne looks at Julie blankly.

SUZANNE
A drug addict?

JULIE
You've admitted yourself into a
drug and alcohol rehabilitation
unit. Surely that implies some
sort o£ drug problem.

SUZANNE
Drug problem. Yeah, I guess, but
not... not a drug addict. See, T
never took any one drug.

SUZANNE (CONT'D)
(thinks a beat)
I guess that makes me a drugs
addict, huh? My doctor told me ft
didn't so much have a serious drug
problem as a drug problem I should
take seriously. -
JULIE
(raises her eyebrows)
I see. And did you?

SUZANNE
What?

JULIE
Take it seriously?

SUZANNE
I guess so. I got here. You
can't get much more serious than
this.

Julie makes a note.
JULIE

Did you deliberately try to take
your Life?

SUZANNE
(flabbergasted)
What?!
JULIE
You know, kill yourself, suicide,
overdose.
Suzanne is affronted.
SUZANNE
No.
JULIE

I'm sorry if my question offends
you, but having to have your
stomach pumped indicates fairly
suicidal behavior.

(3) 13

SUZANNE
Well, the behavior might be, but
I'm certainly not. I always
describe my drug taking as taming
the beast. When I go to someone's
house, I go to their bathroom, run
the water and go into their
medicine cabinet. If they have
pain killers -- I take them.
They're mine, I usually leave a
few. I'm like Robin Hood. I take
from the straight and give to the
potentially stoned. Me.

Julie makes a note.

JULIE
Do you always have to be funny?

SUZANNE
No. Not unless it's a very
serious situation. Then it's
necessary. {I think they call it
gallows humor. This way to the
gas, ladies and gentlemen.

JULIE
(interrupts)
You're going to have to learn to
handle a reality without drugs.

SUZANNE
Hey, you teach me how to identify
it, I'll try to learn how to
handle it.

JULIE
Everybody has their own particular
reality. Only you can identify
yours.

SUZANNE
Well, then we're both out of luck.
I'm in the business of fantasy.
My family's in the business of

fantasy -~ Fantasy is my reality.

I don't understand how I almost

wanted to do.

JULIE
What did you want to do?

SUZANNE
(shrugs)
Just... get out of everything.

JULIE
That's very different isn't it.

SUZANNE
Can you tell me what to do?

JULIE
That's your first step to recovery
-- is to recognize that you don't
know. That your best thinking got
you into an emergency room. But
we've all been there. Here we're
all recovering addicts and
alcoholics. I've been clean for
thirteen years. Off heroin.

INT, DRUG REHABILITATION HOSPITAL — NIGHT 14

An oversized hospital room which serves as the family
therapy room, or movie room, or cafeteria.

Family night at the Dawn of New Bope Drug and Alcohol
Rehabilitation Center in Century City.

patients are seated in a circle on cafeteria chairs
with two chairs in the middle. In the hot seat (center
chairs) are ROB, an agent, and his wife, CAROL, the
cocaine addict. JIM, a therapist, is conducting the
session. He is an attractive, large black man in his
thirties. Rob is impeccably dressed, down to his
socks.

He is an ambitious workaholic whose manner is arrogant
and cold. Carol is a nervous gentle girl who is intim-
idated by her husband. She chain smokes. Other
addicts and their families sit and watch Carol and Rob
in the hot seat.

JIM
(good~naturedly)
It's nice to see you here again,
Rob.

ROB
I'd like to say it's nice to be
here, Jim, but...

JIM
I know it must be very unpleasant
for you to have to deal with all
this.

ROB
Of course it's not pleasant, but
Carol feels that it's important
for me to participate, so I come.

JIM
Iosee. But it's difficult for you
to see the point, is that it?

ROB
Of course not. It's just that, as
you know, this is Carol's second
visit with you people and the
first time I came down here
happily.

Carol laughs ironically and rolls her eyes.
Suzanne watches Rob and Carol intently.

(confrontive)
What, Carol?

CAROL
(reluctantly)
Nothing. I don't know. I never
felt you were happy to come here
at all, is all.

ROB
That's not true, dear. Tf
specifically remember you noticing
how involved I was last time.
This time, admittedly, I'm not
quite as enthusiastic. I have a
lot more work that is impossible
to interrupt as easily as last
time and I know I don’t have to
remind you that when we married we
had an understanding that my work
came first. You said that you
could live with that arrangement.
You know how important it is for
me to devote a lot of time to my
job in order to do well. And
certainly you benefit from my
success. Don't I give you
everything you want? Don't we
live in a nice house? All I ask
from you in return is a little
support and some peace and quiet
while I read my scripts on Sunday.

As this dialogue continues, the group looks very uncom
fortable, squirming in their seats, particularly the
women, and most particularly, Suzanne.

still feasible.

Good evening.

Jim stands to one side, watching. The rest of the

Well?

Carol watches fearfully from Suzanne's seat.

Suzanne starts out haltingly and gains confidence as
she continues.

SUZANNE
This is my first post overdose
performance, SO bear with me.

(clears her throat)

I wouldn't feel comfortable telling
you how I felt. I'd be afraid I
might get it wrong. I might make a
mistake and say the wrong feeling
and then you'd correct me. You
talk to me like I'ma child. So
officious and grand. I can feel
you massing on my borders; a Little

She seems very unusual. What did

Doris throws her bag on the bed and pulls out a pack of
cigarettes. She looks around for an ashtray. Suzanne
gets a paper cup, puts a small amount of water in it
and hands it to Doris. Doris lights up, sits down and
crosses her legs dramatically.

SUZANNE
I think she was making a joke.

DORIS
Oh well, I'm glad you're making
friends. Now, did you call Mort?

SUZANNE
Not yet.

you should change agents. f don't

Instant gratification takes too

myself I wouldn't do this and now
look. I didn't want you to see me

for you. I never wanted you to go
through any pain. I tried so hard
to shield you, protect you. I
always worried that I'd lose you.

Ah, I'll just rinse these out. I

They're so handy for the road.

Suzanne grabs her underwear from her mother's hands.

SUZANNE
Leave them. I can do them.

Suzanne and Doris wrestle with the underwear for a
moment. They gaze at one another silently for a beat.
Suzanne's face is red. She isn't breathing. Doris

SUZANNE
Well, I'm always a little bit
nervous; SO...

MARK
You don't seem nervous. You seem
different. Like Manson. .

SUZANNE
Uh-huh. That makes a certain kind
of sense.

Mark pushes Suzanne higher and higher. The light
sparkles through the trees.

MARK
Did I tell you what Manson said
about Redwoods?

SUZANNE
Yes.

Mark pushes Suzanne high into the sky. We STAY in the
sky.

As we PAN DOWN, we hear... the BUSTLE of a film set~- 23
ting up. Men SHOUTING at one another, equipment being
moved, generators humming, lights being set up.

EXT. MOVIE SET - BACK LOT OF STUDIO - DAY

Several camera equipment and wardrobe trucks, prop
truck, makeup and hair truck, toilet truck, catering
truck, and one long trailer which contains six com-
partments. These are the artists’ dressing rooms, all
with names on the doors. Among the names are the
stars' names, ROBERT MUNCH and SUZANNE VALE.

We see a car approaching from a distance as we watch
the hum and activity of the film set organizing for its
first day. The station wagon that has been approaching
now drives up. Suzanne is in the back seat with wet
hair. The car is met by a young man with a beard, TED,
carrying a walkie-talkie.

TED
Yep, she just got here. I'11 show
her to her trailer.
{to Suzanne)
I'm Ted, designed to make your
life a more annoying place to he.

SUZANNE
{bowing slightly)
Suzanne, designed to be annoyed.

doors. Each door has a name on it.

TED
(continuing;
indicating door)
And this, of course, is your...

SUZANNE
(interrupts)
My hamster cage.

Suzanne climbs the three little steps that lead into
her allotted space. Ted follows her.

TED
I was going to say resting place.

SUZANNE

(laughs)
My final resting place. I always
suspected it would end like this
-- alone in a tiny room with an
air-conditioner, a toilet and an
A.M. radio in the middle of
nowhere.

INT. LITTLE ROOM 24

fhe little room is very little. Along one wall is a
sort of makeshift bed with a cushion to lie down on or
be used as a couch. There is a makeup mirror with a
counter under it and a chair beneath that. There is a
small closet on the left as you enter at the foot of
the bed, and in the right-hand corner is a little room-
ette containing a toilet and a sink. The air~-
conditioner is over the door, the radio on the wall.

fed stands in the doorway as Suzanne surveys her space.

TED
Hopefully it won't end like this;
it'll just middle.

SUZANNE
Yeah, hopefully, it'll end ina
large, air-conditioned room with
an A.M./F.M. radio.

TED
I know what'll cheer you up. The
producer is coming to see you. I
mean, one of the producers.

SUZANNE
How many producers are there? 7

TED
Three. The Father, the Son and
the Holy Ghost.

SUZANNE
And which am I endearing myself to
this morning?

Before Ted can answer, a large man, JOE PIERCE, appears
at the door and knocks. He is middle-aged and looks
like someone's stepfather. He is followed by Rob
Sonnenfeld, the agent Suzanne Lambasted in the drug
hospital.

JOE
Anybody home?
SUZANNE
Who is it?
JOE

Joe Pierce. Just came to welcome
you aboard.

Ted squeezes past Joe and Rob as he exits.

TED
(to Joe)
Morning, sir.
{to Suzanne)
So, can I tell them you're about
ready?

SUZANNE
I guess.

Joe Pierce walks into the trailer and sits largely on
Suzanne's small trailer bed.

JOE
Any more people in here and we'll
need a lubricant.

Suzanne laughs uneasily. Joe laughs heartily, slapping
his thigh. Ted exits.

See you later, Ted!
{to Suzanne)
Suzanne, this is my agent, Rob
Sonnenfeld, who's just come to
make sure we're all A-okay.

ROB
{testily)
We've met.

Rob remains as aloof as possible considering the tight

quarters.

SUZANNE
(awkward)
Good to see you.

JOE
We just came by to say hello and
make sure everything is up to

snuff.

SUZANNE
Everything's great.

JOE
And we're going to need a drug
screen.

SUZANNE

Excuse me?

Joe shifts his large body heavily.

JOE
It's not for us, you understand.
We aren't worried about you at
all. [It's that damn insurance
company. They refuse to cover you
without a screen.

SUZANNE
I see.

JOE
Of course, we're behind you one
hundred percent. It's just one of
the formalities of the business.

SUZANNE
I understand totally. Do you want
urine or blood?

JOE
I'm sure urine will do just fine.

SUZANNE
Great. Do you have a cup or
something I can put it in?

JOE
Oh, don't worry about that. The
nurse'll come by and get it from
you later today.

Joe slaps his thighs and stands up.

JOE
(continuing)
Well, I'm glad we had the chance
to have this little talk. Well,
I'll leave you to get ready. See
you out there.

SUZANNE
Okay. Thanks.

We HOLD on Suzanne's face as she watches Rob and Joe
disappear out of her tiny trailer.

EXT, FILM SET - DAY (ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES LATER) 25

Gaffers and electricians, setting up a shot around a
large cactus. The lights are being arranged with paper
in front of them or screens to dim the lights. Stand-
ins are tied to the cactus. The D.P. checks the lights
on their faces with his meter. He shouts instructions
to his assistants, one of whom is checking the distance
between camera and stand-ins with a tape measure. It's
a movie set, for chrissakes.

Suzanne wanders to the edge of the set, watching them
set up. Her hair and makeup have been done and she is
in costume. She looks rather attractive for an under-
cover cop.

Ted appears at Suzanne's elbow.

TED
We're about ready for a line-up.

SUZANNE
Are we going to get a rehearsal,
by any chance?

(CONTINUED)
49,
25 CONTINUED: 25

TED
I think you've got this film
confused with a big budget film.
The lower the budget, the fewer
the rehearsals, the worse the
food. Get the picture?

SUZANNE
(from the song "Leader
of the Pack")
Yes, we see.

Ted guides Suzanne over to the cactus and she is tied
up to it with Robert Munch.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Hi, I'm Suzanne.

ROBERT
Morning. Robert.

Rocky, the First A.D., shouts over the bullhorn.

ROCKY

Quiet please. We're going to do a
block for camera, everybody.
There's a lot of dialogue, so
we'll need your total cooperation.
Also, keep in mind, there are live
snakes in this shot, so we'll need
you to be very, very careful.

Robert and Suzanne look at each other. Live snakes?

26 INT. SUZANNE'S DRESSING ROOM 26
It is the end of the day. Suzanne is removing her
makeup in front of the mirror and eating a doughnut and
drinking a Coke. There is a KNOCK at the door.

SUZANNE
(calls)
Yeah.

TED (0.S.)
Your mom's here.

Suzanne gives her reflection a perplexed look.

Suzanne approaches. We hear Doris talking.

DORIS
I haven't been on this lot since
tony Randall and I shot “The Ghost
of Rubber Boot Farm" in 1952.

WOMAN
It remember that one. You rode a
donkey in it.

DORIS
Oh, that donkey! I even remember
her name. Stella. Stella the
donkey. Her trainer couldn't get
her to do anything. Except pee.
All it seemed to do was pee. f
said where is it all coming from?
It can't be the straw.

Doris sees Suzanne.

DORIS
(continuing)
Oh, hello, dear, surprise. Your
old mother came to pick you up,
see?

Suzanne flushes in embarrassment at her mother's public
persona. She gets into the car next to her mom. Ted
sticks his head in through the window. Doris kisses
Suzanne.

TED
So I take it you don't need your
driver, Miss Vale.

DORIS
No, she doesn't. I'm her driver.
I'm her reason.

SUZANNE
Ted, this is my mother, Doris.

heard her talk; you're working
with her.

SUZANNE
Mom...

DORIS
I'm embarrassing my daughter. She
hates when I taik.

SUZANNE
Only when you talk about me like
I'm not here. Like I've passed on
to my great reward.

You know your call for tomorrow,

SUZANNE
Yeah. Thanks.

Doris starts the car. Suzanne eats her doughnut.

DORIS
Bye-bye, all.

DORIS

You shouldn't eat so much, dear.
You're starting to look years
older than yourself.

SUZANNE
Great. I'll just have some
heroin, then. No, better yet,
some of that near~heroin that just
came on the market. You know,
like near beer?

DORIS
You've made your point, dear.
Don't let's fight. Well, how was
your day, darling?

SUZANNE
They made me do a drug test.

DORIS
I knew it. I knew you shouldn't
do this film.

SUZANNE
Yeah, but you knew I shouldn't do
it because it was a bad film, not .-
because they were gonna make me do
a drug test.

DORIS
I don't analyze like you do. It
just felt wrong to me. I had a
dream that it wasn't right.

Suzanne rolls her eyes.

DORIS

(continuing)
I know you don't take my dreams
seriously; not even the one that
predicted your kidney stone. You
know, I had a dream the other
night that I was drowning.
Sinking to the bottom of the
ocean, with a heavy sequined dress
dragging me down,

SUZANNE
What does that mean?

DORIS
I'm not trying to alarm you, dear,
Ifm just trying to prepare you.
You know, I didn't want to tell
you before, ‘cause you were in the
Clinic and all that, but you know
the hysterectomy I had?

SUZANNE
Yeah, the one last year?

DORIS
They found tumors.

SUZANNE
Really?

DORIS

Fibroid tumors.

SUZANNE

But you know, dear, in our family
all the women die young. All have
weak systems.

SUZANNE
But Gramma's still alive.

DORIS
Barely. And don't contradict me,
dear. I'm trying to tell you I
might not be here much longer. Tf
don't want to alarm you, I just
want to prepare you for my death.

SUZANNE
(sotto)
Fuck me, what are you gonna wear.

DORIS
{not hearing her)

It's important you understand how
precious your life is. I left you
my emeralds and the rehearsal hall
in my will, so when I die, I can
look down from heaven and watch
you pay off your house. Although
if you keep spending money like
you do, I'm not going to leave you
anything. Or if I do I'll leave
it to you in trust.

SUZANNE
Great. Then you can even have
control from beyond the grave.
How did we end up talking about
your death from my drug test?
Could we just not talk, Mother? I
don't feel very well.

DORIS

You should let Dr. Feldman look at
you; maybe you have tumors. I had
one the size of a grapefruit.

(sighs)
My own daughter won't even listen
to me. If only you'd change back
to my business manager, I bet
you'd feel better. I certainly
would.

SUZANNE
I'm going to kill myself.

you've gotten out of a drug
Clinic. People might take it the
wrong way.

EXT. DORIS MANN'S ENCINO HOME - TWENTY MINUTES LATER 29

Doris and Suzanne drive up. Many cars are in the
driveway. It looks as though there's a party going on.

SUZANNE
It looks as though there's a party
going on.

DORIS

Surprise! I thought I'd invite a
few people over to celebrate your
coming home.

SUZANNE
But, Mom, I have to get up in the
morning...

DORIS
All right, if you want me to, I‘1l
go in there and tell them all to
go home.

INT. DORIS MANN'S FRONT ENTRANCEWAY - A FEW MOMENTS 30
LATER

The door flies open and Doris stands there with her arm
around Suzanne.

DORIS
{calls)
My little girl is home!!!

About twenty people or so stand around. Mostly friends
of Doris. Also her friend Aretha from the clinic.
Suzanne looks mortified.

Her grandparents are there, PEARL and OWEN, as is her
housekeeper/nanny, MARY, a black woman about the same
age as her mother. Her grandmother is seventy-five.
Suzanne's stepfather, Sid Roth, sits drinking and
watching television. Sid essentially never speaks.
Suzanne's grandmother, Pearl, is an extremely critical
woman. Her grandfather, Owen, has the beginnings of
Alzheimer's Disease, and doesn't quite know where he
is, but has a general idea that he wishes that his wife
(or whoever she is) wasn't there too.

All converge on Suzanne. Except Sid who watches TV and
Owen who smokes and perhaps plays some senile version
of solitaire.

EXT. DORIS MANN'S HOME ~ SEVERAL HOURS LATER 31

Suzanne stands outside with Aretha, looking in through
the windows at the assembled guests. Suzanne is
eating. Suzanne eats a lot now. Candy, potato chips,
Coca Cola.

SUZANNE
(chewing)

I mean, there are people here I
haven't seen since high school.
Nor would I want to. Louis
Karasik, for chrissakes! Where
did she come up with Louis Karasik
-- the last time I saw him, he
threw up scrambled eggs out of his
nose on the way to the library.

ARETHA
He looks like that guy at the (AA)
meeting.

SUZANNE

Wouldn't it be fabulous if my
whole class ended up in AA making
coffee, cleaning up, praying.

Suzanne's grandparents, Pearl and Owen, come out onto
the patio. Owen is holding an empty can of cashew
nuts.

PEARL
Let me look at you, lovebug,
before your fat old grandmother
hauls her rear off to bed.

Pearl smells Suzanne as she embraces her.

PEARL
(continuing)
Mamm. You sure do stink pretty.

SUZANNE
You're not going, Grandma?

PEARL
Well, your mother's started
drinkin’ her wine and unless I
want to sit up all night listenin’
to her rattle off at the mouth, I
thought I'd high tail it outta
here.

PEARL (CONT'D)
Hey, now that you're better why
don't you try to get her to stop?

Suzanne gives Pearl a look.

PEARL

Oh, I know, she's as ornery aS a2
mule, just like Owen.

OWEN
I heard that!
PEARL
Well, you are builheaded, honey.
SUZANNE
Hey, Grandpaw, want some more
cashews?
OWEN

Did I have some already?

Pearl shakes her head.

PEARL
He gets worse every day.

OWEN
Who gets worse -~ I heard that!
Get off my back, woman. I want to
go home.

PEARL

We're going, dear.

OWEN

Not with you! I wanna go home.

Are we going soon?

ARETHA
Soon, Mr. Harmon, very soon.

you do all the live long day.

Owen wanders back into the house singing.

Peari shakes her head.

OWEN
(continuing)
And the farmer hauled another load
away.
PEARL

The other day he punched me when I
was trying to put some clean
pajamas on him.

(embraces Suzanne)
Well, babydoll, I'm gonna
skeedaddle.

You ought to eat more, young lady.
You're no bigger than a pound of
soap after a hard day's wash.

{to Suzanne)
Good night, sugar. Have to let
the dogs out. Howdy has worms.

Pearl exits. Suzanne looks at Aretha.

SUZANNE
I have nothing to say.

ARETHA
The same can't be said for the
rest of your family. What's the
matter with your grandfather?

SUZANNE
Psychologically my grandmother -~
medically Alzheimer's. A very bad
combination. He seems to be
Losing every part of his brain
except for the one that realizes
that the rest of it is going. And
what he doesn't notice, she points
out. As though he's doing it
deliberately. Like Alzheimer's is
an evil vice.

ARETHA
He should go to a senility detox
unit. They could send him to
meetings with other Alzheimer
victims.

SUZANNE
AA. Alzheimers Anonymous. So
anonymous, even you don't know who
you are. "Hi, I'm... and I'm...
I'm... uh... Hi, I'm... what're we
talking about?"

Suzanne laughs.

Doris' drama coach, SYLVIA RICHTER, comes out of the
house and joins them on the patio. Sylvia is ninety
years old and very dramatic. Doris is very like Sylvia
sometimes.

SYLVIA
There you are, Suzanne darling.
Well, dear, I was just saying to
your mother that your taking the
cure makes up for everything.
Give me a kiss good night, dear.

Sylvia embraces Suzanne roughly.

SYLVIA

(continuing)
You remind me so much of your
mother as a young girl in this
light -- it makes me want to weep.
In those early days at the studio,
when she first came to me for
elocution lessons. As soon as she
walked in the door I knew she was
going to be an enormous star.
Just as I knew it about you, dear,
when your mother brought you out
at parties and you did the twist.

 

Mary comes out of the house.
MARY
Miss Suzanne, your mama wants you
inside to cut the cake.

Suzanne looks at Aretha. What cake?

INT. DORIS MANN'S LIVING ROOM 32

Suzanne stands in front of a cake of her face with
candles around it. She blows out the candles, which
had essentially made her hair look like it was on fire.
Doris embraces her daughter proudly. Suzanne looks
exhausted.

A very gay-looking OLDER MAN starts up a chant.

GARY
Sing something, Suzanne!

A large body of the group murmur: “Yes! Yes, sing!"

SUZANNE
(humiliated)
No, really, please, I can't.

DORIS
C'mon, sweetheart. Do one of your
old numbers from my act.

SUZANNE
No, Mama, really.
DORIS
Just one number to please your old
mother.
INT. DORIS MANN'S LIVING ROOM - SOME MOMENTS LATER 33

Suzanne is standing next to the piano, singing. Doris'
accompanist, ROGER, accompanies. Her voice is soulful,
beautiful. She holds onto the piano for dear life.

She is almost visibly trembling. She keeps her eyes
trained on the ground.

Doris’ face is a mixture of emotions from pride to
envy. Sometimes she mouths the words to the song with
her daughter. She occasionally shushes the other
guests, even if they aren't talking. As Suzanne fin-
ishes her ballad, Doris is in tears. Suzanne is miser-
able. She finishes and gives her mother a helpless,
caught look.

The song she sings is a baliad like "If I Loved You,"
"Skylark" or "Better Luck Next Time," a yearning, sad
song.

SUZANNE
«ee SO don't say
Better luck next time
That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be
No next time for me.

All are visibly moved. The room explodes in applause.
Doris runs to her daughter's side, embracing her.

DORIS
That was lovely, dear. I don't
know why you don't sing anymore.

SUZANNE
I get so nervous,

DORIS
But you shouldn't be. You've got
a terrific voice -- a terrific
talent -~ a much bigger talent

than mine.
Now Gary starts another chant.

GARY
Now, Doris, Doris, sing something!

The room chimes in once again: "Yes! Oh, yes!"

DORIS
No, no I couldn't. Really, it's
my daughter's night.

SUZANNE
(knowing she wants to)
Go on, Mama. Sing.

DORIS
(to Suzanne)
You think I should?

SUZANNE
Yes.

DORIS
All right. You sang for me; I'1l
sing for you.

(to Roger)
"Gee But It's Good To Be Here" --
in A~flat.

Doris wows them with her song, completely eclipsing
Suzanne. She is a true performer -~ loving it, born to
do it. Nerves of steel, she plays completely to the
crowd.

Suzanne watches. The room is electrified, whipped up
as they can only be in the face of a great and true
entertainer.

Doris casts a long shadow.

INT. SUZANNE'S ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER 34

The party has dispersed. Suzanne has miraculously
escaped. She enters and closes the door behind her,
looking enormously exhausted and relieved. She moves
to the sink intending to prepare for bed.

A voice startles her from a chair in the corner of the
room.

TONY
Hi, baby.

Suzanne jumps in fright and looks around, seeing her
father, TONY VALE, seated in the chair. He stands. He
is in his late fifties, short, dark and formerly hand~
some. He has tremendous boyish charm.

SUZANNE
Jesus, Daddy, don't do that -- you

glad to see your old dad? You
were always thrilled to see me
when you were little.

SUZANNE
I was always thrilled to see you
partly because I never saw you
enough. I mean, that often.

TONY
That was your mother's fault. I
wanted to see you, but she
wouldn't let me -- you were in
Palm Springs or somewhere. Ugh,
I'm defending myself and I don't
want to. It's just that when you
say things like that, you twist
the knife in my heart. I mean, I

No, she hasn't. I do love you,

each other a month ago. I calied

TONY
I never got a message. Who'd you
leave the message with?

SUZANNE
Some woman.

Ah -- Margie.

SUZANNE
Who's Margie?

TONY

The woman I've been living with
for the past four years.

SUZANNE
Oh.

TONY
Baby, is there anyone in your New
York apartment?

SUZANNE
What happened to yours?

TONY
Oh that landlord is crazy ~~ he
kept my furniture. Says I was
screaming. I was screaming
because my finger was infected.

SUZANNE
He's keeping your furniture ‘cause
your finger was infected?

TONY
Oh, he's an asshole. You know I
wouldn't come to you if I had
somewhere else to go ~~ and once
this Marquis thing goes through,
I’1l be out of your hair -~ Baby,

ROGER, the hair dresser, wets down her hair, SIMON, the
English director, approaches and crouches down next to
Suzanne's open car door. He looks embarrassed.

SIMON
Hello, darling.

SUZANNE
Hey, Simon.

He looks at his hands. The soundman finishes and walks
away.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
What's happening? Did you have to
take a drug test, too?

Simon looks confused.

SIMON
Oh, no, no, no. It's nothing
really. They just... the
producers saw the rushes last
night and had some rather
interesting notes.

Roger gives Suzanne one last spritz, sees that Simon
wants to talk to Suzanne privately and discreetly re-
moves himself. Suzanne tries to seem calm.

SUZANNE
Well, what?

SIMON
Now, don't take it the wrong way.
I saw them this morning and you
were fine.

SUZANNE
(gloomily)
It was my first day.

SIMON

(emphatically)
It was your first day, absolutely.
I couldn't agree with you more.
The producers simply felt you
should have fun with it.

Just have more fun with it, that's
all.

Simon, if I knew how to have fun
with stuf£, I wouldn't be in
therapy. I wouldn't need to take
drug tests.

SIMON
Now, now. I think they had some
very interesting comments. Maybe
I'm not saying it properly. What
I think they meant is that you
could own your performance. Make
it more your own. Just sort of
have fun.

Suzanne stares at her feet.

SUZANNE
(sarcastically)
Really? And here I thought
everything I did had to be fraught
with incredible torment. This is
amazing. Why didn't one of my
shrinks tell me this?

SIMON
(patiently)
Now, Suzanne, you shouldn't be in
this business if you can't take
criticism.

Suzanne stares at her feet.

SUZANNE
But, Simon, please. Have fun with
it. Don't you think I would do
that with everything I did if it
was at all possible?

Simon puts his arm around Suzanne.

SIMON
I know you can do this part. Just
relax into it. Be yourself and
you'll be wonderful.

Simon kisses the top of Suzanne's head and walks off to
talk to BUDDY, the D.P., as Ted arrives with a can of
Diet Coke.

they have box office, in which
case, they're treated with respect
without being respected.

Suzanne takes a swig of soda and pulls a candy bar out
of her pocket, taking the wrapper off and taking a big
bite.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
At least with me, there's an
honest level of contempt. They
don't respect me and they don't
treat me with respect.

Ted nods sympatheticaily.

TED
You ought to be an assistant
director if you want to sample the
motherlode of contempt. And
preferably a second assistant
director.

Ted takes Suzanne's arm.

TED

We need to get you touched up.
You're in the next shot.

Ext. BACK LOT OF STUDIO - THAT AFTERNOON 36

Suzanne is headed to the prop truck. She moves through
the warm hum of the crew as they check lights, change
lenses, position extras. She is humming "Gee But It's
Good To Be Here" as she arrives at the prop truck for
her Diet Coke. As she rounds the corner of the truck
heading for the metal steps at the back, Suzanne almost
collides with NEIL BLEENE, the youngest of the
producers.

NEIL
{stepping aside)
Well, fancy meeting you here.
Neil Bleene, associate producer.

Suzanne smiles a startled smile and goes up the steps.
She gets a Coke out of the ice chest, opens it and
stands on the edge of the truck looking down on Neil
Bleene.

Neil looks at his shoes and clears his throat.

NEIL .
Well, no, we felt the performance ~
was fine, but...
(he searches for
the right word)
You're holding something back.

SUZANNE
{repeats solemnly)
Holding something back.

NEIL
It felt like you weren't... that
you didn't make a choice. You
made a non-choice. Like you were
concentrating more on not doing
something than on doing something.

SUZANNE
I see.

NEIL
I've been in theatre. I've also
directed theatre. I'm producing
this basically to make money. I'm
actually a theatre director. From
what I was told, you spontaneously
hit Bobby during a rehearsal, and
Simon stopped you. I don't think
he should stop your impulses. The
other thing is that sometimes
certain line readings are
appropriate, like in comedy, it's
a rule that inflections go up at
the end.

Suzanne kneels down to look in Neil's eyes.

SUZANNE
There's a comedy rule?

Neil runs his hands through his hair.

NEIL
Well, there's not necessarily
rules so much as guidelines.

Suzanne stops, realizing she's gotten pretty defensive

Look, I may not take criticism
well, but that doesn't mean I'm

wish I was someone who welcomed
criticism and immediately
understood its value, but I'm not

Iam. I've had one day of work on
this and this is my second
conversation about what's missing
in my performance.

NEIL

We're talking about two minutes of
film. Two minutes of screen time
out of ninety.

SUZANNE
Is it correctable?

NEIL

Come on, it's not as though you

Thanks for the acting tips and the

Suzanne heads back in the direction of the set, leaving
Neil and his leather pants at the prop truck.

We FOLLOW Suzanne as she takes a swig of soda and
rounds another corner of a truck. This is the wardrobe
truck. As she approaches the back of it, she hears
what turns out to be Simon's voice. Suzanne slows,
eavesdropping on the ongoing conversation. She pulls a
bag of honey roasted cashews out of her pocket and eats
them quietly as she listens to the two voices.

SIMON
Can't you get her into a girdle or
something?

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.)
Not with that dress, sir. We
might be able to use a pantyhose
with a control top. Although, I'm
net sure if that will be
sufficient.

SIMON
All right, all right -- anything.
Just try to do something. And
we're going to have tO put her in
pants instead of shorts. The tops
of her legs are very...

Simon trails off, searching for a polite term for the
tops of bad legs. Suzanne stops chewing, in suspense.
Somehow she knows they are talking about her.

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.)
Bulbous. She has cellulite.

Suzanne winces. Bulbous? Cellulite?

SIMON
I do wish we could get her to stop
eating so much. But then, I
suppose having just given up
drugs, she has to do something.
Maybe we could get her to start
smoking.

What are we going to do about the

SIMON
Cheat the angle somehow, I
suppose. Her breasts are rather
.. out of shape, aren't they?

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.}
I£ you have her on her back, like
the script indicates, her tits
will just move off into her
armpits.

SIMON
How unpleasant. Well, perhaps you
should purchase some sort of
camisole or something. JI had no
idea when I hired her that she was
this... out of shape. Though, I
suppose we couldn't have gotten
her if she was still... in her
prime.

WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.)
I€ you'll forgive me, Mr. Woodruff,
with her reputation she is lucky to
have a job at all. She pretty much

destroyed the career she had.’ This
iS a break for her.

SIMON
I suppose you're right. It's sad,
isn't it, really. She was so good
in “A Night Full Of Shoes." Well,
I hope all this isn't too much
trouble for your wardrobe
department. I'm almost sorry we
didn’t get Valerie Rogers, at this
point.

George Lazan. Executive producer

SUZANNE
Fine... Suzanne ——
GEORGE

Vale, I know. Anyway, have I
caught you at a bad time?

George is silent for a moment, then just suddenly
launches into the purpose of his visit. He walks as he
talks. Suzanne follows, puppy-like.

GEORGE

(continuing)
Well, look, I saw the rushes and
frankly, you're holding back.
See, I think of this piece as a
light fluffy piece, a kind of
“What's Up, Doc?" for cops. So
you just gotta relax. You gotta
just enjoy yourself and trust the
process.

; Suzanne is incredibly uncomfortable as she walks along~
side George Lazan through the back lot of the studio.

SUZANNE
(evenly)
Well, I can't promise you I'm
going to turn in a Barbra
Streisand performance.

GEORGE
No, no, no. You see, I think of
Robert Munch as a kind of Ryan
O'Neal type. He's a reactive
actor. What we need is for you to
be the one who governs the pace of
the piece. If you dictate the
pace, then Bob will follow you.

Night" kind of thing. You know
what I mean. Look, do you think
you can do this part?

SUZANNE
(tiny voice)
Yeah. Why?
GEORGE

I always ask my actors that.
Look, just because we imagined
Goldie Hawn or a Marilyn Monroe
kind of thing in this part... now
we've got to deal with what you
have to bring to it. We hired
you, now we have to go with what
you have.

SUZANNE

(sighs)
I appreciate your comments, Mr.
Lazan. I'11 certainly give
relaxing my best shot. If I'm not
enjoying myself, though, it's not
because I'm deliberately trying to
sabotage your film.

GEORGE
I realize that. Just do the best
you can. Oh, and, by the way,
don't worry about the nose.

SUZANNE
{touches her nose)
The nose?

The driver holds open the door. Suzanne watches him

go.
Suzanne walks back onto the set and approaches Simon.

SIMON
Hello, darling. What's the
problem?

SUZANNE

(stern)
The problem, Simon, is that
hundreds of people have had
conversations with me concerning
my low enjoyment levels and my
nose... and... and it bothered
me. I would prefer to receive
direction solely from you.

Simon looks concerned and the wind almost blows off his
straw hat. .

SIMON
(affronted)
Really? Hundreds of people? That
shouldn't be. I'll have to have a
word with them.

SUZANNE
I mean, we're talking about one
day of work here. A scene where I
was tied to a cactus and assaulted
by snakes all day. As if I were a
child! I mean, why don't I give
them my mother's phone number?
She can stand by and make sure I'm

This is incredibly upset. If this
is the quality, then maybe...

Simon puts his arm around her and walks her toward the
platform where the crew waits.

SUZANNE

(interrupts)
Darling, just be yourself and
you'll be fine. I know it sounds
trite, but trust me. I'll talk to
the producers and make sure what
occurred yesterday is not
repeated. Now try to calm down.

Suzanne looks at Simon like one of them is insane.

Suzanne is once again removing her makeup at the end of
a long, overwhelming day.

She takes a last look at her reflection, and then exits
her dressing room/hamster cage.

EXT. BACK LOT STUDIO SUNSET - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 38

Suzanne is walking down a western street, then turns a
corner into a suburban street, reminiscent of “Leave It
To Beaver."

Jack Burroughs appears behind her, catching up to her.
Suzanne looks at him blankly for a second. She has no
idea who he is. Then seeing as how she'd better con-

best determine his identity, she smiles.

I could apologize to you for not

bad stuff, don't you, dear? What

played at that party? Do you
remember that? No. You just
remember that my skirt accidentally
twirled up and that --

SUZANNE

And that you weren't wearing any
underwear! Why do you have to
take over every situation that
you're in? Why do you have to
overshadow me?

DORIS
I haven't overshadowed you! What
have I done to deserve such a
bitter daughter? It twirled up, Tf

got here ~~ I was just coming to
get you! And I don't care if he
likes me or not!

SUZANNE
Sure you do! You want everyone to
like you.

Suzanne is sulking slightly.

JACK
Your stepfather is a very dynamic
man. We had quite a chat while
you were gone.

SUZANNE
(distracted)
Yeah, right.
JACK

I didn't realize your mother was
Doris Mann. What's it like having
a mother that's a movie star?

SUZANNE
Compared to what? When I didn‘t
have a mother that was a movie

JACK

SUZANNE
No. Well, there was a brief

JACK
I don't want to have a casual

JACK
Do you joke about everything?

SUZANNE
Frequently when things get too
serious or stray too far from my

JACK

SUZANNE
Officially, yes. Look, I just got

Suzanne opens the front door very quietly and shuts it
very quietly behind her. She tiptoes gingerly down the
fall, past the living room, where Doris Mann sits in
the dark, smoking.

DORIS
(evenly)
Have you any idea what time it is,
dear?

Suzanne jumps, startled.

SUZANNE
Jesus, Mother, don't do that! You
scared me!

Doris turns on the light on the table next to her. She
is in her robe. There is a bottle of wine on the floor
next to her and she holds a glass. The ashtray is
almost full and she smokes.

DORIS
I suppose it never occurred to you
that you might have scared me by
staying out so late. I was about
to call all the emergency rooms.

SUZANNE
I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't call

Doris starts pouring herself another glass of wine.

She looks

up to see Suzanne watching her.

DORIS
(continuing)
Do you mind if I have a drink?

SUZANNE
Do you mind if I drop acid?

DORIS
Dear, I drink socially.

SUZANNE
I took acid socially.

DORIS
I hardly think my drinking can be
compared with your drug taking,
dear. And even if it could be, I
think your involvement with drugs
has vindicated me. I hardly think
you're in a position to judge me.

SUZANNE
Mom...

DORIS
I hope you weren't out sleeping
with someone.

SUZANNE
No, I wasn't out sleeping with
someone, Mother.

DORIS
Well, if you were, I hope you used

you.

SUZANNE
Oh, and I suppose you do?

DORIS
I think IT do, yes.

SUZANNE
That's the drunk calling the
kettle stoned.

DORIS

How did we become so estranged,
Suzanne? I have always tried to
be a good mother to you, only to
be met with this fresh, superior
attitude of yours. You have felt
my intellectual superior since you
were fourteen years old -- and
rightly so; you were always more
verbal than I. Me. Whatever.
But why have you turned away from
me? I just want you to like me.
I just want to be your friend.

SUZANNE
I didn't need a friend. I needed
a mother.

DORIS
Well, you can accuse me of many
things, but not of not being your
mother. What is the thing that
annoys you about me? Isn't it
that I mother you? You know,
dear, it's very hard to have a
conversation with you. Do you
hear how you're talking to me?

SUZANNE
Oh please, these are the options?
You, or Lana, or Joan?

DORIS
You'll never Eorgive me for
falling under the pressures of
life. For not living up to the
standards I set for myself. For
being the person I am in your
looking-glass, for not remaining
that person ~- so I broke under
the money pressure. If it wasn't
for you, I would've killed myself.

SUZANNE
There ~~ see, it's like that that
you say. I don't know what to do
with that.

DORIS
Just know how much I love you.
Oh, I know, maybe you needed a
different mother, one that baked
cookies. I don't knit, I don't
embroider, but I have always tried
to give you the best and you throw
it away. I came from nothing and
made something out of my life.
You came from somewhere and are
trying to make nothing out of
yours. You're going to have to
get over what happened to you in
your adolescence, dear. It's time

The camera and crew on the truck film the scene.
Robert and Suzanne have a conversation above the din of
the scene.

ROBERT

for pills. Sees some Darvon. Not her favorite, but
why not? She removes the bottle, opens it. Pours
pills into her hand and pauses. She looks at her face
in the mirror. Is this what she wants? No. But some~
thing. She must have something. She puts the pills
back into the bottle, puts the bottle in her pocket,
closes the medicine cabinet. This time, however, it
makes a loud SQUEAK.

throw away. You could be as big a
star as that... that Madonna girl.

you have to deprive me of some
precious stolen moments of self
pity for having lost my money?

Stolen moments?! You've been

the time for having a monster of a
mother like me. Everything about

me --

SUZANNE

Mother, I never said you were a
monster.

DORIS
No, you don't say it; you're even
too smart to think it. But, you
feel it. You somehow lay the
entire blame of your drug taking
on me.

SUZANNE
I do not, Mother. I took the
drugs, nobody made me.

Oh, sure, that's your logical
brain telling you that, but in
your heart you feel that I'm an...

DORIS
Well, maybe I was an alcoholic --

when you were a teenager. I had a.

nervous breakdown when my marriage
failed and I lost all that money.
But I got over it. Now I just
drink like an Irish person--

SUZANNE
{interrupts )
I know, I know, like an Irish

person -- you just enjoy your wine
-- you drink to relax -- you've
told me.

DORIS

Don't be fresh.

SUZANNE
Is there a cut off age for fresh
or does it just go on indefinitely
as long as you have older
relatives? You don't want me to
be a singer Mother, you're the
singer -~ you're the performer. I
can't compete with you. What if
somebody won? Oh, you want me to
do well -- just not better than
you.

DORIS
Maybe you're just jealous, cause I

anymore. I can handle it and you
can't.

SUZANNE
Handle it!?! How the hell do you
handle it?

DORIS
I'm your mother!

SUZANNE
And I'm your daughter! And I'm

what to do. Look at this! A

This is tragic.

DORIS
I wish my mother had been as
concerned about me when I was a
girl.

SUZANNE
Your mother beat you and locked
you in closets!

DORIS
One closet! And she didn't beat
me, she used a strap on me

They're not sleeping pills,

You don't acknowledge you drink,

INT. LOOPING STAGE - HALF AN HOUR LATER , 56
Lowell sits behind a table with two other men -~ the

editor and the sound editor. The room is in semi-
darkness. There is a music stand with some script
pages on it under a microphone. Also on the music
stand are some headphones.

Suzanne enters, slightly bedraggled and harassed.

SUZANNE
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
LOWELL
What're you sorry for?
SUZANNE
Aren't I late? I thought I was
late.
LOWELL

No, as a matter of fact, you're

Elliot Morse.

Suzanne and Phil and Elliot shake hands and exchange

greetings.

Suzanne continues to look uncomfortable as the scene
progresses. As though she had sand in her soul.

VICTOR (0.S.)
Ready, Lowell.

LOWELL
Thank you, Victor.

Well, shall we begin?

SUZANNE
Okay.

Suzanne stands in front of the little music stand.

LOWELL
You're really much better in the
film than you deserve to be.

Suzanne looks distressed and nods.

SUZANNE
Good. I mean, thank you. I'm
sorry that I was such a nightmare.

LOWELL
Well... you seem -- better now.

SUZANNE

fhe movie comes up on the screen that we saw filmed at
the beginning of the movie only in black and white.
Suzanne is being slapped by the prison guard. She
flies across the room, turns her head slowly and says
her speech. We see Suzanne see herself with a mixture
of fascination and horror. Her eyes squint and she
takes a step backward as though to protect herself from
herself. This version of herself. She is good in the
scene until she fucks up the line.

SUZANNE (V.0.)

(on screen)
»»» We will survive any
humiliation. We have more spirit
and more resources than you. All
it'll cost us is money, while
you... there isn't enough mommy in
the world to further a cause like
yours --

SUZANNE

Shit.

LOWELL
That's as good as it got all day.
We didn't get one full take after
that. You only got progressively
worse.

SUZANNE
I know. I'm... sorry.

LOWELL
Don't be sorry... fix it.

SUZANNE
What?

Lowell motions for Suzanne to put on the headphones.

SUZANNE
(continuing)
Oh.

Suzanne puts on the headphones and they run the film
back. Suzanne watches herself backwards. The film
starts forward again. We hear the three beeps before
the words "there isn't enough mommy in the world" and
after which Suzanne says it correctly.

Perfect.

LOWELL
Let's look at it.

The film is run again. This time with the sound cor~
rection. It is “perfect.” Normal. It has an odd
effect on Suzanne. Her eyes fill with tears. She
controls herself and looks down.

LOWELL
(continuing)
Lucky for you we can cut away to
the guard.

Lowell looks over and notices that Suzanne is more than
somewhat upset. He very quietly sends the two editors
away -~ clearing the room. Lowell moves to Suzanne.

LOWELL
(continuing)

What could possibly be the matter?
Here you've gone back and
corrected the past -- at least in
your work. What could be a better
metaphor? It couldn't be
something I said.

SUZANNE
{cerying)
Nothing you to say to me is as
horrible as what I say to myself
and at least it's happening
outside my head where I can deal
with it easier.

LOWELL
So, what is it? Do you want me to
abuse you more?

SUZANNE
Help me. I can't do it. Any of
it. I don’t know how and I can't
ask.

LOWELL
What are you doing now?

SUZANNE
Don't you get it? I just know how
to talk. I give self-awareness a

The trouble with you is you've had

SUZANNE
No, I do know it. That's the
trouble. I torture myself over
it.

LOWELL
You're not going to get too much
sympathy from anyone. Do you know
how many people would give their
right arm to be in show business?
To lead the kind of life you lead?

SUZANNE
The trouble is I can't feel my
life. I can see it all around me
and I see that so much of it is
good and I just... take it the
wrong way. It's like this thing
with my mom -- I know she does all
this stuff ‘cause she cares about
me, but I can’t seem to... believe
it. And... other stuff.

Lowell hands Suzanne a Kleenex and she blows her nose

hard.

LOWELL
I don't really know what's
happening with your mother, but
maybe she will stop mothering you
when you grow up.

SUZANNE
You don't know my mother.

LOWELL
No, but I know you. You could
make a mother out of anybody.
Look, your mother did it to you
and her mother did it to her and
back and back and back all the way
to Eve and at some point you have
to just stop it and say, "Fuck it,

LOWELL
You just like it ‘cause it sounds
a little like movie dialogue.

SUZANNE
Yeah, that's me. I don't want life
to imitate art, I want life to be
art.

LOWELL
Look, look up on the screen. See
what you can do? And you weren't
even conscious then. Imagine what
you could do now.

SUZANNE
Maybe I should just go back into
the clinic.

LOWELL
Speaking of art? Look, growing up
is a process, not an event. It's
not like in the movies, where you
have a realization and your life
changes. In life you have a
realization and your life changes
a month or so later.

Lowell and Suzanne look at each other.

LOWELL
Well, it doesn't start for 4

Plenty of time to have your

admit I was a little taken aback
when you did a second rate cop

I know everything... Except.

He looks at her.

He smiles.

LOWELL
You know.

Suzanne smiles and nods slowly.
INT. SUZANNE'S CAR ~ DRIVING HOME 57

Suzanne is feeling much better as she drives back to
Doris'. The fever is broken. She is hopeful,
inspired. Possibly the song “Don't Worry, Be Happy" is
on the radio as she drives down Doris' street. At the
end of the block, where Doris' house is, Suzanne
notices lights. What is that? Police cars? No. Oh
no. What's happening? Many people are in the street
as Suzanne drives up. She rolls down her window and
calls to a POLICEMAN.

SUZANNE
Can I see her?

INT. DORIS MANN'S HOSPITAL ROOM 60

Suzanne enters. Doris looks tiny and frightened
sitting in her bed. There is a bandage on her head.
We are seeing her without her wig and makeup for the
first time. She looks startled and vulnerable as
Suzanne enters -- her eyes fill with tears. When she
talks, she sounds very childlike and unaffected.

Pearl sits on the bed near her looking victorious and
smug. Sid sits watching TV, Owen sits playing
solitaire or reading a Louis L'Amour novel. It is a
tableau of vivid women and shadow men.

PEARL
There she is. My other monster.
I can't seem to keep you two out
of the hospital lately.

SUZANNE

Are you okay?

PEARL
She's fine. She just bumped her
