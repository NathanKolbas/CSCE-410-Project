TERMS OF ENDEARMENT
A Screenplay
by

James L. Brooks

Based on the novel by
harry McMurtry -

REVISED Second Draft
March, 1982
rw

OPEN ON: i

A black screen at the lower left hand corner of which
shines a small clown's face. It is barely noticeable
as we BEGIN TITLES.

The music is bright but not so full that we don't
discern with ever increasing awareness the off-screen
voices of a man and a woman, AURORA and RUDYARD GREENWAY.
We hear the downstairs front door close as AURORA arrives
home and shouts upstairs to her husband. "I can't stand
being a mother." "Give it a chance. It's only been a
week." "Are you still in that tub?" "The dector says
I'm supposed to soak.” “Have you gotten out to check
her?" “Yes, she's fine. How was your evening?"
“Everybody was having fun tonight and all I got te do
was worry about the baby." Her footsteps approach;

her conversation continues. We hear one more exchange
between husband and wife. “Aurora, you've just got to
stop imagining that something terrible is happenings to
her all the time." "I know, I know." The door at
screen right opens and we now can recognize from the
light flowing in from the hall that we are in a baby's
room--the clown's face a small nicht light. The

infant is in a hand worked, excellent and therefore
memorable crib. AURORA'S back is to the camera--her
rear end a larse one, perhaps tempting to some--ané

her back-lit outline is round and cushy. She tosses

eft one more comment to her husband. "She is just

about a week old. How endless is the fascination
supposed to be?" And now she turns towards the room

and is facing the camera still illuminated from behind--
the mother's form we may all remember framed in the
doorways of our rooms as we lay helpless and needing.
AURORA stands still for a beat and then, in a tone
fearful but firm, says her first on screen words.

AURORA
Rudyard, she's not breathing.

RUDYARD'S VOICE
Oh, not again.

The lump under the pink blanket behind the licht
wooden bars of the crib is not budging.

AURORA
No, this time she's dead.

RUDYARD'S VOICE
She's asleep.

(CONTINUED)

AURORA
It's crib death.

RUDYARD'S VOICE
: (annoyed) -
. Aurora, it's just that she hasn't
Slept today.

AURORA
Maybe.

The thirtyish mother pads quietly to her infant
daughter's crib and coos softly.

AURORA
Emma... Emma?

The infant lies still. AURORA leans over...then

hixes herself up by placing her foot on the mattress

so she fully leans over the bars--gracelessly to place
her ear almost atop the infant's chest. She hac heard
something but doubt still lingers. Very deliberately
AURORA pinches the infant who instantly begins wailing.

AURORA
(now more hersel?)
There, that's better.
She moves swiftly from the room and exits without a
thought of pacifying the crying baby. As she closes
the door.
cUuT TO:

EXT. GREENWAY HOME - EIGHT YEARS LATER

ie]

A two-door, dark car arrives. From the driver's seat
steps a man of 40 in a dark blue suit and cowboy boots.
He was RUDYARD'S employer. He holds a hand out to
assist ROSIE DUNLOP, AURORA'S maid for years and, though
she doesn't know it, the last white maid in Houston.

She refuses the hand and concentrates on the next one
out, folding back the front seat for EMMA GREENWAY--
misshapen for a child of eight--her legs too short,

her hands too thick--that sort of thing--hair, unusually
stringy, is even worse after the sweaty and emotional
funeral, a black ribbon hangs lifeless in her tresses.
She too refuses help and indicates that the man should
instead help the next cecupant. That's AURORA, who
emerges in black, one hand held by the man, the cther

by her maid. The first thing she does on emerging from
the car is to remeve her shoes. She has her arm around
her young daughter as she moves barefoot across the lawn.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 2

AURORA
Thank you, Rosie.
(then to man)
Thank you.

AURORA is totally composed. The man stands there granite
strons, West Texas' best.

MAN
Glad to help. He was about the
most dependable man who ever
worked for me.

She starts for the house holding EMMA by the hand as
ROSIE goes on ahead.

AURORA
It was nice knowing you.
EMMA
(to man)
Bye.
MAN

I'm real sorry about your daddy.

EMMA .
Me too. I loved him. He stuck
up for me sometimes.

MAN
Rey.
(Emma turns)
Take care of your momma.

EMMA shifts uncomfortably as her mother looks at her,
wanting the man's words to register.

As they enter the house, AURORA walks straight to the 3
mantle over the never used fireplace where there is a
framed picture of EMMA as a baby with her mother and

a framed picture of RUDYARD. AURORA takes down the
picture of RUDYARD. Then suddenly AURORA reacts

having just thought of something.

ROSIE
What's wrong?

AURORA

I just remembered Rudyard wanted
*o be cremated.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 3

AURORA sighs briefly and shakes her head at her
forgetfulness.

EMMA
(entering scene)
What are you going to do with
Daddy's picture?

AURORA
I don’t think we should leave it
on the mantle. There comes a time
when we have to stop living in
the past.

EMMA
Can I have it?

AURORA hands it to her daughter. RCSIE loving the
child from the doorway cf the dining room where she
is already setting the table for lunch. We follow
EMMA past the stairs to the first floor room that
is hers.

INT. EMMA'S ROOM - DAY 4

There is a zoo's worth of stuffed animals, a cheap
record player, an original cast movie soundtrack of
"Wizard of Oz" in evidence, very little free space.
EMMA stands over the table next to her bed containine
a lamp and several of the stuffed animals. She removes
two of her favored ones, a dog and a panda bear, ané
puts her father's picture in their place. She must
remove one more animal to make room.

INT. AURORA'S BEDRCOM - NIGHT 5

So feminine it's hard to believe a man shared this room
until this evening. A small, original Renoir hangs
prominently over the dresser. The bed is larce and
soft. A window seat, also cushy, overlooks the back
garden. AURORA sits in her nightgown at the window
seat. Her bed has been turned down but she cannot
quite bring herself to go to it; she is angry at being
upset. She rises and goes to the door.

INT. AURORA'S HOUSE - STAIRWELL . 6
As she marches down and enters her daughter's room.

She sces directly to the child, turns on the lights.

AURORA
Emma...Emma, wake up.

EMMA
What's wrong?

AURORA
I just feel so tense. And I
wondered how you felt. Do you
want to sleep in my bed?

EMMA
No, thank you.

AURORA
Oh.

EMMA

(a beat, then)
Do you want to sleep in my bed
again?

AURORA
Yes. All right.

As EMMA makes room and AURORA slides in next to her
¢Griping about the number of stuffed animals, she
glances at her daughter's limp, stringy tresses.

AURORA
What will we ever do with your hair?

She turns cut the lights.
EXT. AURORA'S BLOCK - DAY (EIGHT YEARS LATER)

EMMA, her hopeless hair, unaided by the style of the dav,
is the kind of high school girl whose near dumpiness
seems only a minor hindrance because she so totally
accepts it. She is walking with her best friend,

PATSY CLARK. PATSY is a bright, blonde Bayou Club
beauty. She is athletic, warm and sensitive, seemincly
perfect in every way with even the good ¢race to have a
bit of a tortured soul. As they arrive at the house,
there is some activity next door.

PATSY ,
Hey, Emma, what's that?

EMMA
We have an astronaut moving in
next door.

PATSY
Which one?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

EMMA
Garrett Breedlove.

PATSY
Judy has one on her block too. I'11
wait for you. I don't feel up to
handling your mother today.

EMMA
It would be nice to have a mother
somebcdy liked.

She enters the house.
INT. AURORA'S HOUSE - DAY
As EMMA enters, ROSIE is cleaning.

EMMA
Where is she?

ROSIE
(matter of factly)
She's out back with that old fart
who's tryinc to get into her pants.

EMMA
Thank you, Rosie.

She exits.
EXT. AURORA'S BACKYARD - DAY

A good lawn--a garden AURORA cares for, trees to give
her privacy from her River Oaks neighbors--another
aspect of AURORA'S perfect nest.

AURORA can now be fully and clearly seen for the first
time without veil or shadews. She is nearing 40 and
she has a rather simple method for appearing younger.
She allows herself to be courted by much older men.
Standing over her as she reclines in her chaise is
EDWARD JOHNSON. He's S6 years old. He's here to
assert himself but once more AURORA is putting him
through some trying paces.

EDWARD
Iomight not be able to get away
later--Tahiti might make a difference
for us. Why don't you face up to the
fact that you have certain biological
needs?

romantic ones, though.

EDWARD
Well, I might not be a poetic man,

AURORA

Don’t be so sure.
EDWARD

Hello.

EMMA
Hi. Hello, Mr. Johnson.

AURORA
(to Emma) ;
You're not getting hair on your lip?

EMMA
(exasperated)
Nooe.

AURORA -
Oh, good...It was just a shadow

EMMA
(worried)
You sure?

AURORA
Yes. It's fine.

EMMA
I wanted to borrow the car. I got
invited over to the Bayou Club.

AURORA
{to Edward)
We'll be right back.

As they walk away, EMMA anxiously checking her lip with
her finger.

EDWARD
Don't worry. I'll just wait here
in the lush and heavy air.

EMMA
I can't believe how you tease
these men. They've got feelings, too.
AURORA
Oh, you always make too much of the
wrong things.
INT. BRIDAL SALON = DAY - FIVE YEARS LATER 10

EMMA (now 21) posing in a bridal dress. She is flushed,
tickled to the core that the dress is so fantastic. She

has never looked so beautiful. PATSY is wearing a new
maid of honor dress while AURORA sits observing. She
is trying to be a good sport and not dampen the spirits.
It is a difficult chere for her.

- EMMA
. Well, isn't it something how much
fun this is?
(neting cap)
«+. enobody will see my hair.

AUROPA
You lock very nice.
(to saleswoman)
How much is it?

SALESWOMAN
Four hunéred and eighty dollars.

AURORA groans so loudly it jolts the sales¢irl.

EMMA
It is too much, isn't it?

AURORA
Well, Neiman's isn't the only place
to look for a wedding dress. And it
isn't like we're having a lot of people.

EMMA
(accepting)
Yeah, I guess, and just to wear once.

. PATSY
(suddenly to Emma)

Emma, it's my wedding gift to you.
(to salesgirl)

She'll take it.

AURORA and PATSY exchange a look. PATSY will not be
cowed.

EXT. AURORA'S HOUSE ~ NIGHT 11
Two lit windows. One upstairs where we can make out

the figure of AURORA'S pacing--through the other window,
we can see two young women.

INT. EMMA'S ROOM - NIGHT 12

PATSY and EMMA are in pajamas, the stuffed animals still
in evidence. "King and I" is playing as EMMA ties

together a stack of original cast albums, some blues,
some jazz vocals. EMMA'S a mark for a good lyric.
PATSY is rubbing a Marlboro back and forth between her
fingers, the tobacco running out into an ashtray. She
now begins to stuff the empty cigarette with marijuana.
The wedding gown and maid of honor's dress hang
prominently in the background.

PATSY
You getting nervous vet, Emma?

EMMA
No. It feels so natural. Is
something wrong with me?

INT. AURORA'S ROOM - NIGHT 13

She sits at her window seat eating from a box of
checolates. She is troubled. She sighs, rises and
Starts downstairs.

INT. EMMA'S ROOM 14

The cirls are smoking their revised Marlboro. Mary
Martin is singing "Cockeyed Optimist" from “South Pacific."

PATSY
I feel a little foolish cetting
stoned to hear Ethel Merman.

: EMMA
Mary Martin. You're crazy if you
smoke these in a car, Patsy. The
Texas troopers have gone crazy. Flap
knows this one fella in the English
department where a trooper was
following him so he swallowed his
grass--so they scraped his tongue
and used that as evidence. He's going
to get five years.

PATSY
(Patsy has not been listening)
This is the last time we'll be like
this.

EMMA
I just plain refuse to get into that
kind of thinking. Oh, God, this is
the last time we'll be like this,
isn't it?

But we'll always love each other
and our babies will be best friends.

As they hug.

PATSY
It's always meant so much to me
that someone as nice as you loved me.

EMMA
(sobbing)
Oh, Patsy, give me a break.

There is a knock on the door.

AURORA'S VOICE
Emma?

Instantly the two girls part and grab four aerosol cans
and spray the room, a can in each hand.

AURORA'S VOICE
Open the door.

EMMA
You can't come in.

AURORA'S VOICE
What do you mean?

EMMA
(to Patsy)
What the hell? I'm getting married.

She opens the door. The marijuana cigarette in her
mouth. PATSY hysterical in the background.

EMMA
What is it, Mom?
AURORA
(annoyed)

Oh, really. I need to talk to you.

We hear her walk away. EMMA is curious and a bit
apprehensive.

PATSY
Maybe she's going to tell you how
to have sex.

{Patsy laughs)
- Oh, I shouldn't say things like
. that. I didn't mean it.

She bites her tongue.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS AREA - NIGRT 15

To show EMMA a bit wobbly, pause near the living room
getting the small pulse of pleasure she always receives
from taking in the original Klee painting which han¢s
prominently there--a few sharply angled lines, some
black, some grey and some red.

INT. AURORA'S ROOM 16

AURORA sitting under her favored painting--that small
Renoir of two handsome women wearing hats and gowns.
She looks grim.

AURORA
Would you want me to be silent
about something that's for your
own good even if it might hurt
a little?

EMMA
Yes, ma'am, I sure would.

She dashes out, closine the door behind her. We hear
her lauching, giddy--hich on life, Texas weed and her
own wit. AURORA is thrown by the totally unexpected
behavior. She starts after EMMA who reappears, still
havine a creat time.

EMMA
What is it, Momma? I really would
like to get some sleep so I can
look halfway decent tomorrow.

AURORA can't say what she has to in this atmosphere.
Sulky and beleaguered, she retreats to the comfort of
her window seat. I+ looks out on her garden; it is
soft and well-cushioned and safe.

EMMA

Come on, what is it?

She moves to join her. AURORA looks at her examining
her daughter's face, liking the eyes, the round cheeks,
distressed with the limp hair.

AURORA

I was sitting here trying to
concentrate on what wedding ¢ift
to get you...

(Emma waits her out)
For a second, I thought of my
mether's Renoir...

(Emma waits)
So I've been trying--trying to
ignore tke truth.

(launching in)
I am totally convinced that your
getting married to Flap Horton
tomorrow is a mistake of such
proportions that it would eripple
your destiny and make wretched
your lite.

EMMA doesn't know what hit her.

AURORA
Flap is limited, he has no
imagination. Even at this ace,
all he wants is a secure teaching
job. He's not that attractive...
his teeth...

EMMA
You don't know anything about me.
Shut up...just shut up or I'll get
you back. Just how can you do this
to me now? How can you? How can
you? How can you? How can you?

AURORA
Because I'm your mother and I know
you're not special enough to
overcome a bad marriage.

EMMA
(shocked--crazy mad)
Oh. Oh. Occoccoe. I'm going to
get you back.

AURORA
Will you stop taking what I'm
saying personally? Use your brain.
I'm telling you the truth.

EMMA
I can get you on your looks. You're
so worried about aging--well?...
You know your neck's losing shape...

EURORA'S remarkable gifts for self preservation come
into play. With muscles never before needed nor
flexed she moves to stifle her daughter's rage.

AURORA
No. You will not do this.

EMMA
I'm not that scared of you. You
know, your rear end...

AURORA
No. I mean it. This is a crossroads
for us. Don't make a mistake. Do
you want to stay my daughter or not?

Almost literally AURORA is shoving her daugher's words
back down her throat. Wills lock only briefly before
EMMA'S gives way.

EMMA
(calmer)
You're just so awful to me.

AURORA
That's more like it.

EMMA
Thank God for Flap Horton for
getting me out of here.

She starts out then wheels on her mother.

EMMA
If this is your attitude, I don't
think you should bother to come
to the weddinc.

AURORA
I think you're right. The hypocrisy
was bothering me too.

EMMA exits in disbelief.

EMMA
My own mother's not coming to my
wedding.

AURORA
Now I suppose you're mad at me.

EXT. AURORA'S STREET - DAY 17

A yellow '69 XKE convertible, it's top down, is forced
to move slowly behind a beer delivery truck. In the
truck are ROSIE and her husband, ROYCE. In the car are
GARRETT BREEDLOVE and an 18-year-old girl. GARRETT is

a once famous astronaut for the United States of America.
He is in his mid 40's and sexy. He's an easygoing over-
achiever who truly believes that life can be simple and
fun. GARRETT and his date are hung over from a night

of carousing.

ANGLE ON AURORA. 18

In a housedress as she stands barefoot on her front

lawn, a garden tool in hand. She is looking with
undisguised contempt at the former national hero as he
pulls into the driveway immediately adjacent to her own,
as ROYCE steers his truck into AURORA'’S driveway. It
conceals BREEDLOVE'S car from our view. AURORA quickly
shifts her attention to ROSIE as she steps from the truck.

ROSTE
No matter what my kids do to me,
I hope I'm never such a stump as
to not be at their wedding.

AURORA
They don't seem to have weddincs--
they just have christenings, don't
they?

ROSIE
Den't get me pissed at you. You're
having a hard enough time.

AURORA nods, a bit downcast.

ROSIE
(continuing)
Just do me a favor and give me a
while before I have to feel sorry |
for you.

AURORA
How was it?

ROSIE
Let me get changed and I'll tell
you everything.

“ROYCE has gotten down from the truck and hovers into
view. His beer belly is fabulous-~the buckle of his
belt pointing straight down to the ground.

ROYCE

I just wanted to say congratulations
and that the bride looked almost as
pretty as her momna.

AURORA
Thank you. I'm pleased you dropped
by.

ROYCE
I'm pleased that I did, too. Gooc-
bye, then.

ROSIE starts for the house, loathing ROYCE for finding
AURORA so attractive. ROYCE backs the truck up
revealing GARRETT'S XKE. He and the young woman have
passed out in the car, their heads laying together, the
girl's hand resting on his crotch. There is a NASA
sticker in the window shield. AURORA takes in this
picture post card from the second level of heli ané
then advances on the car. She taps the young bicnde
girl gently on the shoulder.

AURORA
Miss...Miss...

The hungover girl mumbles incoherently--the chain
reaction to AURORA'S pushing her shoulder is to have
the girl's hand jiggle the man's privates.

AURORA
(shaking harder)
Young woman...young woman...?
(to man)
Chile molester?

GIRL
{mumbling sexily as she feels him)
Uh-oh, here goes the rocket.

AURORA, shocked, shakes her violently. The ¢irl's eyes

open and focus on this angry woman old enough to be
her mother.

So far I've avoided meeting him

As she moves to her house.
EXT. FLAP AND EMMA'S HOME - THAT NIGHT 19

This is a garage apartment in the area around Rice
University--poor housing to some--a “find" to graduate
students of which FLAP HORTON is one. There are stairs
leading up to the door and an area at the top of the
stairs with just enough room for a somewhat rusty

porch swing. Houston is built on a swamp. It is
tropical; the air is extraordinarily sensual and, for
EMMA, sitting outside on one of those humid, fragrant
summer nichts is part of what being Houstonian is all
abeut. So she sits here now with her new husbande, still
halt dressed in the clothes they were married in, a bit
drunk from champagne, with their belongings inside
awaiting the setting up of housekeeping if energy ever
strikes. Their clothes are dirty from the porch. They
are somewhat sweaty as they eat from a Kentucky Colonel
carton. FLAP finishing off some corn-on-the-cob. FLAP
is 23 and looks like a nice guy.

EMMA
I'm glad we didn't try to do a
honeymoon.

The phene begins ringing.

EMMA
She's going crazy. I'll make
her wait till noon tomorrow.
That's about all she could take.

FLAP
You're totally justified to stay
clear away from her forever.

EMMA
Oh, she just came apart because I
was leaving and she was feeling
more alone.

CONTINUED: ig

FLAP
(as if to a simpleton)
Emma, your mother boycotted your
wedding. She hates your husband and
she only holds you in medium esteem.

EMMA
"Medium esteem"=--you're so cute.

FLAP stands and helps her up, finishing some corn-on- 20
the-cob. She gives him a little kiss and hand-in-hand
they walk across their threshold. Books are stacked

in piles, most of them paperbacks. As they move

past the stacks.

EMMA

Wouldn't it have been strange i=
one of us married someone who

' @idn't like to read? And there
must be millions of interesting
people in the world who just don't
like to read. I feel so totally
good about us. I hope I get
pregnant tonight.

PLAP
It would be nice. I love the
way you look. You're so nice
and round.

Now FLAP tosses his corn away and embraces her in
good-natured sexuality and moves her towards the
mattress lying on the floor without boxspring.

EMMA
(between kisses)
The only thing I don't like
about sex is that it always
means the end of a conversation.

Now they go at it on the mattress, the windows open,
lamps on at the other end of the room provice illumi-
mation. When FLAP gets horny, it would never occur
to him to close doors or shut out lights. Sut he
pauses for some atypical foreplay, kisses her body,
touches her, they grin at each other.

EMMA
(impressed with his foreplay)
Well, aren't we being leisurely
tonight?

She holds his head to her chest, gives it a sudden
squeeze. Then a wave of tenderness as he begins to
kiss her friendly buds. The phone, finally after
some 35 rings, stops.
. EMMA

It's just a shame that my mother's

too arrogant to ever admit how

‘wrong she was about you and how
levely and wonderful you are.

But now she pauses because the SOUND of FLAP sucking
the corn from his teeth between kisses of her breast
is distracting her.

ON FLAP 221

Pausing over the breast, making the noise that's
somewhere on the graph between annoying and plain
disgusting. His nose wrinkled in concentration as
he tries to suck loose another kernel. He finally
goes and busies himsel£ once more with EMMA'S breast,
then feels her staring down at him.

EMMA
(swatting him)
What are you dcing?
He realizes suddenly ané they both laugh.
FLAP
(embarrassed and pleased
with himsel£)
Come on, it's not that terrible.

He picks at his teeth. A kernel of corn falis to
EMMA'S breast as she flicks it away.

EMMA
Flap, for God's sake. What's
the opposite of romantic?
EXT. EMMA'S APT. - MORNING 22

From the record player, we hear Ethel Merman and
Russell Nype singing "I Hear Music” from "Call Me Madam”.

He smiles and reaches next to him for a paperback book.
The phone starts ringing from the kitchen. FLAP makes
a sour face. EMMA decides to answer it. Scampering
from the bed, she is wearing one of FLAP'S T-shirts and
nothing else.

INT. EMMA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 24
EMMA picks up the phone.

EMMA
(into phone)
I'm not ready to forgive you.
I'm happy--leave me alone. I
don't want to talk now.

She starts to hang up, then reconsiders.

EMMA

(continuing)
Oh, did you see the table cloth
Rosie made me? Oh, it's beautiful.
No, not yet. I thought omelettes.
No, I'll do them sort of Tex-Mex.
I don't feel like talking now. No,
I mean it. That was the worst thing
you ever did to me.

FLAP comes padding in shirtless, zipping up his jeans
as EMMA sees him.

EMMA
{continuing into phone)
Well, I think you owe my husband an
apology. Well, until you do tell
it to my husband, I'm not going
to listen to any of your gossip.
He's right here.

FLAP gestures he wants no part of the phone. EMMA mimes
that he must do this. He shakes his head. finally she
wins the silent debate, FLAP taking the phone. EMMA'S
concentration on his end of the conversation is
extraordinary.

Hello, Mrs. Greenway...No, ma'am,
I'm not enjoying your predicament.

EMMA
(shouting towards phone)
Momma, be nice. I'm not kidding.

FLAP

(overriding her)
As a matter of fact, I don't need
or desire an apology. All I want is
for you to understand and appreciate
my position, to respect our marriage
and to maybe wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning.

(he grins)
Yes, I guess I've said my piece.
Okay. I'll put her on.

EMMA gives him a big kiss. Takes the phone.

EMMA
Hi. Isn't he great?

INT. AURORA'S BEDROOM - MORNING - ONE YEAR LATER 25

The legend ONE YEAR LATER appears on the screen. AURORA
is still asleep though the sun is shining in and from
the television set, left on from the night before, we
can see the TODAY SHOW with Hugh Downs as host. There
is noise outside--vulgar, male “walla". She gets up

and walks to the window.

EXT. STREET - AURORA'S POV 26

An all night party breaking up at GARRETT'S house. A
motley group of spent revelers saying goodbye to him

at the door. He accepts their embraces while holding

a waste basket full of empty liquor bottles in the

other hand. Now he restrains one girl, bidding her

to stay; she nods acquiescence. She waits for him
while he happily goes around to the side of the house--
the driveway adjoining AURORA'S--removes the lid from one
of his main garbage cans to empty his container into it.
He misses. The bottles crash. He looks at the mess,
then does some twinkle-toed broken glass running back
to the girl. She laughs.

once more arrested.

EXT. STREET - AURORA'S POV 23

ROYCE'S truck pulls to the curb. ROSIE gets out one
door, ROYCE the other. He reaches into the cab and
loads her with some shopping cartons, then looks up.

ROYCE'S POV 29

AURORA in her nightgown, pink folds of satin, white
lace straps, the goddess of middle-age come to haunt
his next erotic beer dream.

ON ROYCE AND ROSIE 30

As she follows his glance while burdened with packages,
then looks back at AURORA, still visible. She gestures
for AURORA to step away from the window, which AURORA
does. She nudges ROYCF sharply.

ROYCE
(defensively)
Even a priest can look.

ROSTE
Is that why you drove me today--
to catch a glimpse ef your dreamboat?

She marches off towards the house.
ANGLE ON KITCHEN DOOR. 31

ROSIE can see AURORA dialing the phone. ROSIE balances
the carton and struggles with the key, all within plain
sight of AURORA who makes no effort to help her.

Finally AURORA hangs up and busies herself with breakfast
rather than open the door fer ROSIE.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY 32
As ROSIE enters.

AURORA
(into phone)
Hi, it's me. I don't want to
rive in this rain. Would you
pick me up?

for a little male approval?

ROSIE

I didn't think of that.
EXT. HOUSTON SHOPPING MALL - DAY . 33
Sheets of rain are falling. Women waiting in the slim
shelter of the department store awning for men to
pick them up in the car...Traffic is heavy-~the pick-up
area three and four cars deep.
INT. EMMA'S CAR - DAY 34
As she maneuvers towards the area--four cars from the
curb. She beeps. AURORA gestures for EMMA to get
her car closer.
EMMA
(yelling)
Iean't. You're just going to
have to get a little wet.
EXT. HOUSTON STREET - DAY 35

Pouring rain--EMMA'S old, clearly run-down car in late
afternoon rush hour traffic.

INT. EMMA'S CAR - DAY 36

AURORA, her packages in her lap, notes a bit of water
running into the car from the top of her window.

AURORA
Look at this--it's raining in.

EMMA

Well, heavens.

She is straining to see out, wiping at the fogged
windowshield with her hand.

We don't need language like that now.

The car comes to rest blocking two lanes.
INT. CAR ~ DAY 38

The engine is silent. EMMA takes a breath of relief,
tries to start the car; it will not turn over. AURORA
shakes her head in disapproval. EMMA crimaces at her
mother's attitude then puts her hand on the door handle.

EMMA
We'd better get out of here.

AURORA
Why do I have to?

EMMA
It's too easy for another car
to plow into us.

EXT. CAR - DAY 39

EMMA gingerly getting out the driver's side, no protec-
tion from the rain, the cars rushing by. A hand reaches
through the passenger's window, an umbrella opens;
AURORA steps out being ever so careful as she switches
the umbrella to the other hand, steps gingerly to the
street, is startled by a passing car and falls face

down into the street. As EMMA rushes around the car
towards her, the spray from the wheels of a passing
truck drench AURORA, the packages she was carrying moisten
and open showing the garments she purchased. As EMMA
struggles with her mother, they look up and react:

calmly setting down flares, his car parked a few feet/

now he helps her to her feet; she is dirty and wet and
staggered by her fall, but, even so, the muddy mess of
a woman flashes a smile, laughs at herself, pulls the
wet dress a bit more snug against her breast.

VERNON
You're not hurt or anything, are you?
AURORA
No.
EMMA
Thanks for stopping. What's your
name? .
VERNON

Vernon Dahlart. So you ain't hurt?

AURORA
No. I'm very grateful. My name's
Aurora Greenway and this is my
daughter, Emma, and I won't blame
you if you don't forgive us for the
way we look.

VERNON
I'm just glad you weren't hurt.

AURORA
I just don't know what we do now.

VERNON
Well, I own some garages, so let me
phone from my car. I'll have your
car picked up and fixed up and arrange
for a loaner for you and I’11 run you
on home and there's some blankets in
the back and a thermos of hot pea
soup and one of vegetable.

AURORA
(overwhelmed)
Thanks.

AURORA takes VERNON'S arm. EMMA following, they walk
to his car. He tugs nervously at his ear.

AURORA
Don't tug at your ears like that.
You'll stretch your earlobes.

VERNON

AURORA
Where else do you go?

VERNON
Alberta.

A car comes by. VERNON ducks AURORA down and takes 41
the spray full in his face. She didn't get it,
however, prompting him to say with sincerity:

VERNON
That was close.

AURORA
What's in Alberta?

VERNON
Oil.

She turns to see EMMA to see if she heard.

EMMA
I guess we're dropping me off first.

INT. VERNON'S CAR - DAY 42

As EMMA gets in the back seat, AURORA in the front.
While VERNON circles the car, they have the oppor-
tunity to take in the two phones, the TV set built in
the back, the safe between the two front seats, the
front dashboard of cowhide, the kind with the hair
still on it. VERNON gets into the car.

EMMA
What a car.

AURORA

Except for this--how'd that happen?

VERNON

AURORA, a blanket around her, sipping soup.

Where do you live?

VERNON
Right here mostly when I'm in town.
The seat becomes a bed and I own a
six-story parking lot so I just park
up top. I keep a hotel room for
clothes and cleaning up but I'm on
the go out of state a lot. I have a
pack of nieces and nephews down here,
though, that I get fun out of. That's
my family and my top men work out of
Houston...I might change that though
because of...whew...what's happening
here?...I never talked so much about
myself in my life.

As VERNON'S car pulls up.

VERNON
This it?

AURORA
Yes. Why do you look so upset?

VERNON
I guess I wish we weren't strangers.

AURORA
I'm giving a dinner for some family
on Wednesday. Are you free?

VERNON
Lord, yes.

My mother gave me money to shop so
I wouldn't look poor next to Patsy.
I got you something.

FLAP'S VOICE
Oh, is Patsy going to be there
tonicht?

EMMA.
(annoyed how this pleases him)
Yesss. You want to dress better?

FLAP enters. He is dressed for the dinner. A sport
coat and slacks. FLAP enters the bedroom as EMMA
snips the tags.

FLAP
Aw, come on.

She hands him a box. He opens the cover and finds a tie.
He is annoyed.

FLAP
How often do I wear a tie?

EMMA
Tonight you are.

PLAP
You didn't get that tie for me.
You were worried about how I'd
look to your mother. I wish
you'd stop being such a quisling
where she's concerned.

—MMA is hurt as she looks at him.

EMMA
Every time I feel really happy,
you turn perverse on me.

FLAP
(disbelief)
And buying that tie made you happy?

EMMA
Yes. Yes. I wish you would under-
stan@ that because you really don't.
It made me very happy describing your
jacket to the salesman, thinking how
it would go absolutely perfectly with
what you're wearing...

dumb to understand that kind of
happiness.

FLAP
I'm sorry. I was terrible. Going

little irrational.

A car horn sounds from outside. FLAP moves towards the
door.

EMMA and FLAP’S father, CECIL. He's wearing a good suit
that doesn't look like it belongs on him. AURORA is
wearing a long green gown and some silver jewelry. In
a series of quick cuts they go through a ritualistic
inspection.

As AURORA closes the door.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT s5

ROSIE is passing a tray with goodies. She's smoking.
AURORA is guiding CECIL through the room. VERNON enters
with a drink in each hand. Never, at any moment, do his
eyes leave AURORA. At one point PATSY stares at him as
he drinks in AURORA.

PATSY
You like her, huh?

He doesn't hear her. Because at that moment AURCRA
laughs at something. VERNON loves her laugh, his eyes
shine, he shakes his head in utter wonderment at how
perfect the laugh is.

VERNON

Lord, she's somethin’.

PATSY

I'm too good for you to stop with
any meal.

Well, we'll see.

FLAP
Don't make fun of him.

AURORA
Really, every time you get two
sips of a drink in you, you start
looking for a way to confront me.
Don't do it in my house.

CECIL
Whut's going on? Leave her alone.
She's fine to me.

AURORA
Let's sit down--Patsy, Vernon.
Patsy, find Emma.

EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT : 56

ROSIE, smoking, has a tray of drinks beside her as she
and EMMA sit with feet up on the back porch. They are
drinking.

ROSIE
So he stays away four whole days
and when he comes back, he doesn't
even stay awake long enough to rub
my back.

ROSIE.
You was always the best child I
knowed. I always feel bad inside
that I love you more than my...Own.
Anyways, after he fell asleep, my
throat just closed on me. I got
the choking feeling. You know what
I'm talking about?

EMMA
No.
ROSIE
(surprised)
Oh, good.

PATSY now decides she can interrupt.

PATSY
You mother's serving.

ROSIE
Let's go.

She walks briskly inside. PATSY and EMMA walking in
behind her. EMMA feeling natural. For her the episode
with ROSIE was not particularly special but PATSY, as
happens to her with some frequency in this friendship,
feels shallow next to EMMA. There is a half-beat of
alienation as PATSY walks alongside her.

EMMA
You okay?

PATSY
Yes.

She puts her arm around PATSY'S shoulders as they walk in.

Seated at the head of the table, VERNON and CECIL on
either side. She catches VERNON staring at her intently
and pushes his face a bit so it is pointing in another
Girection. She, in turn, is fixed on the spectacle of
CECIL using a prawn to mop up the very last traces from
his plate. He is really into it, dipping the prawn in
the gravy and slurping it dry, then re-dipping it.
cEcIL .

And you thought I couldn't do...

AURORA
I'm sorry but I just can’t understand
you if you talk with your mouth full.

CECIL
Sorry.

He takes the food from his mouth and holds it in his hance.

Now I was saying...

Just wanted to see your face.

He chuckles and replaces the food in his mouth.

AURORA keeps a steady eye on her daughter since they

are handling the good china.

AURORA

What do you mean?

EMMA
I didn't get the test back but
you know me, I'm never late.

I'm going to get so mad if you're
not happy for me. I mean it.

AURORA
And what abcut meee? What about
my being a grandmother?

EMMA
What's wrong with that?

AURORA

Nothing. It's wonderful. It
just might not be true.

EMA
I think it is so you might as well...

AURORA
{angry but clenched)
But maybe it's not. So let's not
start the celebration prematurely.

She stalks out the side door leading to the front vard.

AURORA walks the lawn barefooted under the stars. 60
This moment staggers her. She moves into a darker

area so that we can just see her, but we hear her
sighing, collecting herself. Suddenly she is illumi-
nated by headlights as a long Lincoln pulls in the
bordering driveway.

GARRETT
I'll let you know after I stretch

That's okay. Come inside.

DORIS
No, thank you.

DORIS

GARRETT
Well then, Doris, why not come in?

GARRETT

This wasn't a good time.

He tries to pull himself up by grabbing a full garbac
can. Instead it tips over. Garbage is on him, he is
bleeding considerably, grunting in genuine pain that
has sobered him instantly as the heavy metal cans
crashed against his head. Now AURORA steps out. He
sees her.

Will you give me a hand?

The final tyranny is not how the

TOMMY'S crying is now so pronounced that EMMA excuses

PATSY'S car and AURORA'S Cadillac are in evidence as
are the two women and ROSIE.

FLAP holds TOMMY by the hand as they look with curiosity
at the women doing their leave-taking. AURORA is waiting
with growing impatience for ROSIE to finish hugging and
kissing EMMA goodbye. Just as they seem to have finished
their last squeeze, one of them gets the need for just
one mere; it’s almost an informal reception line with

the reception growing colder as they move from EMMA

to TOMMY to his father.

ROSIE and EMMA are locked in still another embrace.

her face towards FLAP; he kisses her once, leaning
forward to barely brush her cheek with his lips;

they don't touch. PATSY gives him a hug; he squeezes
a might too hard.

She thinks it's me. It's not.
(turning to others)
You're her friend, Patsy, tell her.

She moves to her grandson. He stares at her. They
are not close.

- AURORA
Well, Tom.

She pats his head absently.

TOMMY
Goodbye, Aunt Aurora.

TOMMY gets in the back of the car. FLAP and EMMA in
front. ROSIE starts to cry. AURORA looks at her with
d@isapproval so ROSIE moves off to enter AURCRA'S car
and cry in private.

PATSY
Write as soon as you get there
so I know your adéress and all.

EMMA nods, not able to speak.
EMMA'S POV FROM INSIDE CAR 67
PATSY and AURORA standing just a few feet apart. AURORA
s a bit more vulnerable than we might have imagined anc
a bit less than we'd hope.
AURORA
(to Emma)
The phone bill is going to be enormous.
EMMA smiles at her mother. AURORA backs off, but before
the car pulls out, EMMA beckons PATSY over to the car
for a private word.
ON AURORA 63
Overhearing what EMMA is saying.
EMMA
Do me a favor. Look in on my mother
once in a while.
PATSY
I think she's glad she finally
deesn't have to see me anymore.

EMMA
No. You interest her.

PATSY
Okay. Be happy. I love you.

EMMA
Me, too.

They kiss through the open window.

FLAP
Can we go now?

EMMA
_ (wanting a last, long look)
Okay. But go slow.

FLAP hits the accelerator, burning rubber. They move
quickly out of sight.

69 AURORA AND PATSY 69

Standing several feet apart. Their first moment ever
tosether without EMMA as intermediary. From the look
on AURORA'S face, it is obvious to PATSY that she has
overhearé. An awkward pause, then:

PATSY
I really would like to come see
you from time to time.

AURORA
(nicely, even warm)
I think we both know I'm not old
enough to need a welcome wagon
and you've got too much going
for you to be one.

PATSY
Oh, Mrs. Greenway.

She shakes her head and walks. We can almost see the
minute beat where AURORA decides not to linger and look
back at the apartment her daughter lived in as a bride
and young mother.

70 EXT. BUS STOP =~ DAY 70

As AURORA'S car comes to the curb to drop ROSIE off.

ROSIE erying, AURORA can't bear it. She leans
ROSIE to open her door.

AURORA
- Here's your bus stop. Will you

she shoves at her.

ROSIE

Den't push me when I'm erying.

- AURORA
It's not the end of the world.

ROSIE
It's the end of your world. Emma's
the only one who can take ya.

AURORA
That's right, I don't have a devoted
husband like yours to comfort me.

ROSIE

Oh, you shit-head.

You don't know how lucky you are.
Everybody wants to go to Des Moines.
People come from all over the world
to get one look at Des Moines before
they die. Some people think it's
the best city in Iowa.

FLAP grins at her.

TOMMY
I know you're teasing. Texas is
the best.

EMMA gets on her knees and begins to fix up a bed for
TOMMY in the back seat. As she does so...

EMMA
Stop worrying. We're going to see
terrific new things.

As she turns back, her eye is caught by something
out the window.

EMMA'S POV 73

A sign lit by a billboard lamp. It reads “You are
now leaving Texas."

BACK TO EMMA 74

Her eyes filling with tears. She is surprised and a
bit embarrassed by her reaction. She turns to FLAP,
pointing at the tears in her eyes, feeling foolish.

EMMA
Well, look at me.

EXT. AURORA'S HOUSE - EVENING 75

AURORA upset--barefoot. Walking her backyard, working
the garden. We hear a man running, whooping, then the
splash of water, then swimming, then a man emerging
from a pool. AURORA does not approve.

GARRETT, toweling himself, naked to the waist, at least
from what we can see, comes to the fence separating the
property.

GARRETT
Sorry. I just took a sauna and
you can't help yelling when you
hit that cold water.

She nods and continues putterinc, unnerved by his near
presence.

GARRETT

You're not going to ignore me
when I speak directly to you?

AURORA
I'm not ignoring you. What amTi
supposed to say? Okay. I suppose
it is hard not to yell when you
hit that cold water.

He grins, muses whether to confess something tc her.
She has turned away.

GARRETT
Hey.

Hey?

She almost looks straight at him but is unable to and
busies herself again.

GARRETT

Well, what is your name--Aurora?

She looks at him with astonishment.

GARRETT
(continuing easily)
Then they canceled the evening. But
I was really going to ask you out
for a minute there. In spite of
everything. Isn't that a shocker?

AURORA
Sure. Imagine you having a date with
someone where it wasn't necessarily
a felony.

GARRETT
(having fun)
What would you have said if I'é
asked you--seriously?

AURORA--just a bit unnerved--thinks for a beat, then:

AURORA
I would have said I'd like to see
the White House.

So you would have gone. Well,

She turns, suspecting she's being teased, ready to be angry.

76 AURORA walks to her shoes and picks them up. She 76
wiggles her toes in the grass, looks at the attractive,
grinning man.

AURORA
You know, your manner isn't--there's
something like you think you're
toying with me.

GARRETT
Yes, I'm playing with you, Aurora.
Want to play? Have Lunch.

There were countdowns when I had

they strap you in an@ you're in the

powerful than yourself, you might as

AURORA
I’m not going. There’s really

She half-runs to the house. GARRETT chuckles.
EXT. SMALL PARK - SMITH COUNTY, KANSAS - CLOSE ON SIGN 77

Ite fills the screen and tells us that we are at the exact
epicenter of the United States--the middle of it all. We
ARM UP and BACK from the plaque embedded in the ground
ané see the three HORTONS posing for a picture being
saken by a young Japanese. TOMMY is biting his fingers
te the quick. EMMA and FLAP have their arms around each
other. They look young and frightened anc lost.

On this image, we:
GO TO BLACK.
EXT. HORTON HOUSE - DES MOINES - SIX A.M. 78

We are looking through bug splattered glass--the wind-
shield of the HORTON'S car, the bug bodies so prominent
that they lend irony to EMMA'S first comment on her new
home.

EMMA
It locks pretty.

INT. HORTON ROUSE - DAY 79

The house is simple, close set on either side by very
gimilar homes. FLAP begins toting the many boxes inside
while EMMA struggles to manage TOoMMY'S absolutely dead
weight out of the rear seat of their two-door car. Finally.
she gets him on her shoulder and moves on wobbly legs
towards the front door of her new home while her husband
carries in two stacks of books. There is in her a growing
excitement. This far away from her mother, there comes

a vague feeling of extra power, a kind of maturity.

(CONTINUED)
79 CONTINUED: 79

EMMA'S happy. As they get into spoon-style sleeping
position. Even though the shade is down, the sun is
rising and the room is fairly well illuminated.

EMMA
God, I'm exhausted.

FLAP
You ever made love in Iowa?

EMMA
(turning to him; she's tickled)
Even after all that driving.
(a few kisses then)
It's great that Tommy's room is all
the way in the back, and we can get
‘ noisy when we want to.

FLAP
You get to do that little high
pitched squeak of yours.

EMMA
(swatting him)
Fonestly...how about you?
(imitating him, she shouts)
Oh my God--here I go again. Yes!
Yes! Yes!

FLAP
(sexy, soft)
Oh, God, here I go again. Yes--yes--yes.

EMMA
(surprised, shy)
You know your voice just made me wet.
(suspicious)
How come you know how to make your
voice like that all of a sudden?
{sudden flash)
You know we can't hear Tommy either.
I'll check him.

She gets out of bed. He scowls at her. Before he can
say a critical word...

EMMA

- I'll just be a second. Don’t get
pissy.

As she moves through the house made maze-like by cartons
and boxes. She stops at TOMMY'S door, then deliberately
catches herself and stops herself from entering. As

she walks back to her own room.

r DISSOLVE TO:

SAME HOUSE - SIX MONTHS LATER 81

Some furniture has been purchased, the place homey.
Notably different from Houston as FLAP has moved

from poor student to poorer teacher, his furnishings
have kept pace. We are looking at TOMMY who is taking
on the sophistication of an aging toddler. We HEAR
FLAP and EMMA'S conversation from their bedroom, as
does TOMMY, who is not especially interested. They
are talking in loud whispers.

FLAP'S VOICE
I have eight or nine papers left
to grade--this isn't love; it's
selfishness.

EMMA'S VOICE
It's been almost a week since we've
been together. We've never gone @
whole week.

INT. HORTON'S BEDROOM 82

EMMA in bed pulling her dressed husband's arm. Even
though they each have conflicting priorities at this
moment, this is more fun than argument. The reason
they are whispering is apparent in the back¢round
where we see EMMA'S old crib holding her baby, TEDDY.

FLAP
Sure, we've gone a week.
EMMA
(releasing him)
Only during the real pregnant months.
Forget it. Just do me a favor. Don't

make me feel silly and I won't make
you feel guilty.

noise of his father returning. FLAP takes EMMA by the hand.

FLAP
Let's hurry.
EMMA
(gleeful)

I absolutely love that you came
back. I absolutely love it, you
have no idea. I feel like you've
saved our lives.

We'll have breakfast in a minute,

The bedroom door closes behind them. TOMMY walks to
the door and outside.

EXT. HORTON'S HOUSE - DAY 84

As TOMMY sits on the steps we HEAR the faint sound of
a woman's squeak.

DISSOLVE TO:
SAME SCENE - FIVE YEARS LATER 85

ToMMy is now ten. TEDDY is five and wearing at least
part of the outfit we saw on TOMMY in the previous
scene. They are sitting in front of the house and
HEARING the off-stage argument their parents are having.

FLAP'S VOICE
I don't know why you don't get a job
if you're so worried about money.

EMMA'S VOICE
What am I going to do with the boys?

FLAP'S VOICE
It's supposed to be a great day when
you get tenure. -

unable to resist scurrying after his brother.

As they move down the block.

FLAP'S VOICE
Then I don’t see why you can’t
ask your mother for money.

The beys are both upset, TEDDY seeking camaraderie,
TOMMY withdrawn.

TEDDY
Tommy?

TOMMY
I don't want to talk.

. TEDDY
What do you want to do?

TOMMY
(flaring out)
How about punching each other in
the stomach and seeing who can hit
harder? You want to do that?

TEDDY looks at him, disappcinted. There is a half-
second attempt to stare him down, then:

TEDDY
Maybe later.

EMMA comes out of the house in the distance, distraucht, 87
looks up and down, spots her kids and comes marching

towards them. TEDDY sees her and runs towards her,

hugging her hard. She hugs him back. She is 30 years

old and obviously distraught. She comforts TEDDY and

eyes TOMMY who has refused to budge.

EMMA is made more angry than guilty by the remark.

EMMA
Okay. We'll let you say one really
mean thing to your mother each year.
So that'll do till you're eleven.

TOMMY
You're driving Daddy away.

EMMA
Don't make me hit you on the street.

They walk to the car.

EMMA pushing a full basket, her sons in tow. She
pauses at the frozen food bin.

EMMA
(to Teddy)
You have never eaten Texas style
gumbo.

TEDDY
(excited)
No, can we?

He nudges TOMMY to join in the lobbying but TOMMY,
though dying for anything with the word "Texas"
attached, remains aloot.

EMMA
Why not? It's a good time for a treat.

She takes some frozen shrimp, reacts to the high price,
and drops it in her basket.

As the checker rings up the sale, a few people
waiting in line behind the HORTONS. The checkout
girl rings up the total.

GIRL
Forty-four dollars.

EMMA digs at her purse, stalls for a time while
@igging for additional money.

TOMMY
(mortified)
You don't have enough money?

EMMA
(to girl)
I have thirty-eight dollars and
forty cents. I guess I'll have
to leave some things here.

The girl rolls her eyes. =MMA surveys what she's
bought. As she does, the girl addresses her colleague
at the next counter.

GIRL

Could I have the recister key?
She deesn't have enough money.

TOMMY stands a few steps off. TEDDY clings to her.
He suspects he's supposed to be mortified.

EMMA

There's nothing wrong with this.
I just took the wrong purse.

She hands back the TV Guide. The girl deducts 25 cents.

He indicates a box of Mydol.

EMMA
No way.

EMMA hands back the candy bars. She has just taken
candy from her baby.

GIRL
Forty dollars and thirty-five cents.

TOMMY

Mommy !

EMMA quickly takes a single bar from the rack and hands
one to TOMMY.

GIRL
Forty dollars and forty-five cents.

She looks at TEDDY who does not complain. EMMA takes
another candy bar from the rack and gives it to TEDDY.

GIRL
Forty dollars and fifty cents. We're
going in the wrong direction.

EMMA

merest of hints that he may have had a few drinks.

have just panicked, Flap, and trying
to save yourself, you have thrown out
your character and principles. The
only way you can possibly redeem
yourself and be the man God intended
you to be is to take the responsibility
and admit anything that you may have
been doing tonight. If you don't do

INT. AURORA'S DINING ROOM ~ NIGHT 99

Gathered around the table, a birthday cake in the center,
are AURORA, VERNON, the BANKER who wanted to take AURORA
to Tahiti on Page 6, and a new face, the newly widowed
DR. DOUGLAS RATCHER, a family physician--he delivered
TOMMY. The BANKER is finishing, reading a poem he

wrote especially for the evening while AURORA busies
herself licking the icing from some of the burnt out
candles. :

BANKER
And so another birthday for a gal
named Aurora Greenway.
Even though 50, she stiil takes my
breath away. :
Mere mortals just gaze as she lights
up their sky.
A heavenly object--a siren's cry.

The poem has come from his heart. He looks at her.

BANKER
You're the best...Happy Bizthday.

DR. RATCHER
You're not lying about your age,
are you?

AURORA
Of course not!

DR. RATCEHER
I thought you were 52. Come on,
Aurora, how do you expect to fool
the family doctor?

She stares at him.

DR. RATCHER
(xindly voice of reason)
I'm just saying it's better for you
emotionally to tell everyone your ace.
We'll all still like you just as muck.

She looks at him, staggered that he's pursuing it. 100
ROSIE has entered with more coffee. She is enjoying
AURORA'S predicament.

VERNON
It seems to me she said her age.

AURORA
Thank you so much, Vernon. Now...

DR. RATCHER
My point is the number doesn't
matter, but the effort to conceal
it does.

AURORA
(to Rosie)
He's still talking about it.

ROSIE
Dr. Ratcher...

DR. RATCHER
Damn it--I'm trying to do some
good here. The way to adjust to
old age is...

AURORA is on her feet. She flees towards the kitchen.
RATCHER coes after her. ROSIE grabs RATCHER in a
bear hu¢ from behind.

ROSIE
Doctor, you're a might confusec
now because of being recently
widowed. So let me go after her.

In her stocking

In the back-

staring at her.

The three male faces in the window--VERNON, the IDIOT
DOCTOR, the PATHETIC BANKER--slim pickings.

ON AURORA

As she looks across at the astronaut's house, through
the side window, we get a glimpse of his moving from

view, apparently cooking.

Now with sudden and

extraordinary purpose, she runs across the lawn to

strangely in the shadows a good ten feet away when
GARRETT opens the door. He's in his 50's now. His
face and body show it. His blessing is that he's
hlissfully unaware of that fact. He is wearing one of
those short velour bathrobes with nothing on underneath.

105 ON GARRETT 105
At first he doesn't see her, then does.

AURORA
I was curious whether you still
wanted to take me to lunch.

GARRETT
I doen't remember when we were
supposed to...

AURORA

A few years back you asked me to...

GARRETT
(incredulcus)
A few years...

AURORA

...lunch and I wanted to know if
the invitation still exists.

GARRETT pauses. She stares dacgers from the dark. He
then takes the easiest out.

GARRETT
Why not?

AURORA
When?

GARRETT
Tomorrow?

AURORA
All right.

She walks back to her house, GARRETT locking after her.

ROSIE nods in agreement.

As ROSIE enters. She hears some noise from the kitchen.
AURORA is in a slip talking on the phone to EMMA. The
breakfast table is covered with make-up items anc a
mirror has been set up. She is almost wildly energetic,
perhaps even happy.

AURORA

Emma, don't be an idiot. Of course
he's seeing someone else. Catch him,
confront him and leave him. Well, —
are you happy the way things are?

Good morning.

I've got better things to worry

107 INT. AURORA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - HOUSTON

GARRETT waiting at the bottom of the staircase. She
comes down. She is clearly giving this her best shot,
dressed just so, her hair a tribute to its dresser,
delicately and perfectly done.

AURORA
Hello, Garrett. Let's get going.
I'm starving...
(nervous)
...and there are no hidden meanings
in that.

As it moves into a parking place at a shopping center
in Des Moines. She gives herself a quick onceover

His grin is too wide. He is shrugging with his face,
a sort of helpless gesture of raising his eyebrows

and ears. He's a Lucky man for he is approaching one

of the few women around who would find his machinations

endearing.

SAM BURNS

As GARRETT opens the door of his yellow Corvette and
AURORA slides in, with some difficulty. The top is
down. Now GARRETT gets in, puts on his seat belt,
glances at her as she pats at hersel?.

GARRETT
-~If you mind the open air, I can...

AURORA
No, don't worry. Grown women are
prepared for life's little emergencies.

She removes a scarf matching her outfit. As she ties it
in place, they pull out.

An eight track playing loudly to override the force
of wind in the open car. GARRETT is relaxec. He
shouts over the wind to her.

GARRETT

Us going out together. Not bad.

AURORA is trying to be inconspicuous as she holds onto
her scart. She turns to give him a tight returning smile.
The scarf flies off and her carefully created mane whips
wildly in the air.

AURORA
Would it be too much trouble to put
the top up?

GARRETT
The top's home in my garage.

She takes this in. The CAMERA shows the huge, expansive
sweep of road yet still ahead of them.

Four younger women are seated at a nearby table.

women when you're with me.

GARRETT

114 INT. COFFEE SHOPPE ~ DES MOINES OUTSKIRTS - DAY 114

The lights are brighter than the restaurant we just
left. This place is not designed for leisurely dining
or mid-day rendezvous. It is fast-order functional,
kids with ketchup on their faces, but there is a knotty
pine bar in the back which is where we find SAM BURNS
and EMMA. They are holding hands in the shy manner of
decent people preparing for mortal sin. SAM is being
overwhelmed by both his good fortune and inner guilt.
He is between a rock and a soft place.

SAM BURNS
You know, the thing I didn't expect
was that there would be moments where
I forget to be scared someone will
see us together.

EMMA
Don't be so scared. Contemplating
sin is all we've done.

He moves. There are some bruises. She is bending over him.

He starts back towards the car rubbing his wrist. He

Taking a bit of her eclair and then throwing it into a
waste basket. She is experiencing the first gnawing
staces of an anxiety threatening to escape and ravage
her after decades of quiet. She crosses to a dresser
and searches for a particular nightgown, finds it.

She sits, nightgown on her lap, anc goes through the
phone book. She writes down a number which she finds,
all the while throush the open window we HEAR GARRETT
doing his laps. She takes off one earring and tosses
her head a bit to get the receiver just right before
Gialing. The phone rings until eventually we hear
the SOUND of laps stop. We hear the muffled voice of
GARRETT at the other end saying, "Hello".

AURORA

Hello, Garrett. I was just sitting

Sometimes it's really stupid to pretend
you're stupid. JI am saying what I mean.
I'm inviting you to lock at my Renoir.
Yes, it happens to be in my bedroom.
Don't cackle. Do you want to see it?
Whenever you like. You could come
right now or be a fool. See you in
a bit then.

- If I don't answer the bell, the back

door's open.

She hangs up, holds herself briefly. The excitement so
great that it's unwelcome. She stands and crosses to
the bathroom, more frightened than she expected.

We remain in the bedroom area where we HEAR the rustle
of satin and then the doorbell ring.

AURORA'S VOICE
Oh, my--he ran it?

She rushes from the bathroom dressed in her nightgown

and carrying a largish mirror which she sets up near the
door GARRETT will soon enter. Now she turns off the
light, moves quickly back to the doorway of the bathroom
and poses, backlit, in the doorway trying to make out her
image. The nightgown is simple and sexy. Then we HEAR
GARRETT on the stairs. She rushes across the room,

takes the mirror back inside the bathroom. There is

a knock on the bedroom door. AURORA enters wearing a
bathrobe over her nightgown.

AURORA
Garrett?

GARRETT'S VOICE
Sure.

She opens the door. He is wearing wet swimming trunks.

GARRETT
(apelogetically)
I was doing laps when you called.
Lucky for you I'd only done eight.

He grins at her. She turns her back on him and looks
up at the painting as he approaches from behind. He
puts his hands on her shoulders.

GARRETT
I like the painting. I like
everything in here.
(into her ear)
Relax, baby, it's going to be great.

She wheels on him, sputtering in indignation, feeling
genuinely and deeply reduced and insulted.

AURORA
Just who do you think you're talking
to like this? Don't you realize
I'm a grandmother!

Ané with that she takes his face and gives him a stunning,
open-moutheé, expert kiss. They break. He is staggered.

AURORA
It's not flattering if you look
too surprised. Just give me a
minute.

Her self-image buoyed by her own actions, she moves
towards the bathroom pausing to scoop up & perfume
atomizer from her dresser.

GARRETT waits, a hand reaches around to turn off the
light and then we see AURORA as she posed earlier,
backlit and intriguing.

GARRETT
I like the lights on.

AURORA
Then go home and turn them on.

He accepts her conditions and stands waiting in the
shadows. She moves towards the bed. In the darkness
we can see him stepping out of his elasticized swim
trunks, hopping a bit as he fails to release the
second leg smocthly while AURORA turns back the covers
and slips inside. He joins her under the covers.

GARRETT
This is the softest mattress I've
ever been on!

AURORA
Well, coming from you...
(then a whispered secret)
I always like to splurge on bedding.

we hear a rustle and see him start to move with enormous

enercy.
AURORA
No.

Let's lie still for a while.

EMMA and FLAP asleep, her arm over his chest. TOMMY
and TEDDY enter. TEDDY begins to move towards his
mother's side of the bed to wake her. TOMMY restrains
him and leads the way to FLAP. In the b.g. now that
the door is open, we hear a fierce, barking cough.

remains asleep.

FLAP

What's wrong?

TEDDY
(soft)
Melanie's sick--hear her?

FLAP listens for a second, then jostles EMMA vigorously.

FLAP
The baby's sick.

EMMA is sleepily but nonetheless quickly on the move.
In the instant before she's awake she has already
covered a good deal of floor space and mumbled some
comforting words. Now, awake, she turns the lights on
at the door, turns to FLAP, sitting in bed.

EMMA
You coming?
FLAP gets out of bed.

Which has been turned into a nursery. As EMMA turns the
lights on and hears MELANIE'S seal-like couch and notes
the baby's limbs are geing.

EMMA
I need a thermometer.

FLAP, standing in the doorway, starts to think about
where the thermometer might be. TEDDY dashes to a
drawer, tearing at things inside.

EMMA

Den't get frantic.

He brings the thermometer. TOMMY, an old hané, gives
her a nearby bottle of Vaseline. .

FLAP walks to her, his manner suggesting that it is

she who is in danger of becoming unglued. He takes

the baby; EMMA sticks the thermometer in. She stands
there holding it. TEDDY is patting the baby consolingly.
TOMMY is loitering in the doorway.

EMMA
Teddy, she doesn't even feel that
hot. You go ahead to bec.

TEDDY
I won't be able to sleep, so why
can't...

EMMA

Please. I'll come in scon...

FLAP
Come on, boys, it's bad enough we’re
making this a drama. It's not going
to qualify as high drama.

The boys exit.

EMMA

I’m sure it's the croup.

INTERCUT WITH:
EMMA'S KITCHEN : 135
Steam and MELANIE and croup.

EMMA
What do you mean if it's important?

AURORA
I'm running a little behind schedule.

She lauchs atypically, then stops herself.

EMMA
You Gon't know the night I had.

AURORA smiles a bit, wondering whether to confide her
own night.

EMMA

(continuing)
Melanie has the croup. Naturally
it happened about two a.m. I still
haven't been to sleep and I don't
know whether he means it or not, but
Flap's talking about moving us to this

EMMA
Okay, I'll let you go. So leng.
I feel so good for you.

EMMA hangs up. Her spirits buoyed. She checks out
her baby daughter, sees that she’s looking better,
says some words of encouragement, i.e., "Well, we're
bouncing right back, huh, Melanie?" Turns off the
kettles, wipes away some perspiration and resumes
her own day.

137 EXT. RIVER OAKS BUS STOP - DAY 137
The bus stops--ROSIE gets off. A bit lifeless as she

ROSIE

VERNON
Just.
She gets in the car.

EXT. AURORA AND GARRETT'S HOUSES - NIGHT 142
We can see GARRETT cooking through the side window. A

Steak, fries and a bottle of wine.

Well, I think it's sad that you

girls.

GARRETT
(angrily)
Need it? Sometimes it isn't enough.
I don't think there's a thing wrong
with using all your assets.

AURORA
Except it turns your profession
into a sex trap.

GARRETT
Oh, come on. We all use whatever
we have. TI earned it. It's as
much a part of me as anything
else.

AURORA
I didn't realize I was tripping
over such a deeply felt principle.

GARRETT

than being out in a field in west
Texas except the sky is black and
you keep thinking how far away you
are from people.

AURORA
That's your stock answer.

And it’s true.
AURORA

And you always leave it at that.

GARRETT
I wouldn't know what else to say
and that happens to be all they
require.

INT. GARRETT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 145

He is in AURORA'S arms, the moonlight filtering throuch
the windew. GARRETT, for now anyway, feels understood,
challenged, loved. He is talking about himself in

the manner of a hungry man having his first meal in
months. She is, as he will later comment, a girl you
can really talk to.

. . GARRETT

You know what bothers me? None of

us ever got together one night, closed
all the doors and compared notes on
the experience. You'd swear there
was a rule that we had to pretend

it wasn't the fun that it was--that

if we started saying just how much fun
it was they wouldn't let anybody go

up anymore. I even got a little
talking to for laughing through a

AURORA makes a motion that he should stop that stuff
and continue.

GARRETT

Anyway,.at this one point, I could
see part of the spacecraft and tell
that it's whistling across the ground,
but it doesn't make a sound so that
the one thing you can hear, the only
noise in the world, is your heartbeat.
It's indescribable, or 2 just can't
tell it better--but that was my moment-~
the one that doesn't go away. You

He shifts uncomfortably.

It is sunny, warmth returning. Iowa cornfields in the
near distance. EMMA is driving SAM this time as her
old station wagon moves along the lengthy dirt road

to this empty farm house and barn.

The car stops, SAM BURNS opening the door for EMMA.
As they move around to the back of the wagon and tug
at an old child's mattress of EMMA'S which they have
packed for love making.

EMMA
It's so strange not having her call.
- You sort of get into the habit of
the phone ringing at 8:00 A.M. sharp.
It's almost as if the things happening
to me now aren't official because she
hasn't given me the business over them yet.

The romance of Iowa--sun, hay, shadows, legends of
farmers’ daughters and plow boys dance in our couple's

never figured to.

As he takes a radio from his briefcase and hanger with

SAM BURNS
That's how I feel every time
we're in each other's company.
EMMA moves towards him...
EMMA
I've just got to grab your ears

She grabs his ears holding his blushing face.

EMMA walking and searching near the English building
of FLAP'S college. She stops.

FLAP, his back to her and us, but we recognize the

winter jacket. He is talking with what appears to

be intimacy to a tall, attractive woman in her late
20's, a colleague. They are under a street light.

The girl has her hand up to PLAP'S face. They are

clearly lovers. Her name is JANICE.

EMMA i54

Her suspicions confirmed. The truth jolts her and
turns her mean. She advances on the couple with the
stealth of Indians and wronged, plump women.

EMMA'S POV 155
Now she is close enough to make out mezmured voices.

JANICE
Will you please, please, please,
please stop telling me this is
just a crush?

FLAP'S MURMURED VOICE

Janice, the whole fun in getting
mixed up with somebody unavailable
and a little older is that sometimes
you get to hear what's really going on.

and we SEE for the first time that he has their beautiful
baby in a pouch over his chest. The baby is making it
enormously difficult for FLAP to catch up with EMMA
because he has to keep his hand on MELANIE to keep her
from bouncing around too much. Though net long--this

is our chase scene.

As she rounds a corner, breathing hard, she sneaks a
Little look back at her husband and child. She slows,
looks again, stops and faces FLAP.

EMMA
Stop jiggling her. She's going
to throw up!

FLAP slows to a walk, catches his breath. EMMA walks
quickly and ignores FLAP while checking out the baby
strapped to his body.

FLAP
Your timing was great. You caught
us before we did anything.

preposterous sentence she has ever suffered.

PATSY, some seven years older than when we last saw
her, is sitting next to EMMA in a cushy chaise lounge,
holding and marveling over MELANIE while, in the back-
ground, TOMMY and TEDDY are having a terrific time
swimming with PATSY'S daughter, MEG, who is just between
the two boys in size and age. TOMMY is notably more
animated and joyous than we've seen him. PATSY is
still a knockout, though no longer a natural one.

EMMA watches with pleasure as her blonde friend cudéles
her blonde daughter.

It was interesting dating Jews

EMMA is nibbline as she helps prepare the gumbo ingredients.

EMMA
I haven't noticed that.

PATSY
In Los Angeles they were so anxious
to make you feel as if they under-

EMMA
That does sound good. I do that

The station wagon packed, the kids saying their last
goodbyes solemnly entering the car. ROSIE handing them
packages of food for the trip. EMMA and AURORA kiss
on the cheek, ROSIE hugs EMMA.

Raising kids in Nebraska, my God.

EMMA gets in, tears in her eyes, drives away. ROSIE
stands there with AURORA.

ROSIE
I thought Flap was just dumb
but he might be a son-of-a-bitch.

AURORA sighs. ROSIE follows her gaze to the house
next door. -

ROSIE
(with disapproval)
See you tomorrow.

She starts off towards her bus stop. AURORA waits a
beat then takes off her shoes and heads across the
iawn to her house.

178 GARRETT comes out of the house. He is subdued, 178
ill-at-ease.
GARRETT
Aurora?
AURORA

Well, hello, stranger. Has it only
been two days?

GARRETT
Can we go someplace and talk?

AURORA
My garden.

They stroll back towards the garden--AURCRA feeling
that "choking feeling"-=she keeps looking, waiting
for him to notice that she's anxious and lighten
the mood. When she does catch his eye, he breaks
eff the contact.

You're some kind of woman, but I'm
the wrong kind of man and it doesn't
look like my shot at being the right
kind is as good as I was hoping.

AURORA
Are you intentionally sounding like
an idiot to make this easier for me?

GARRETT
Well... .

Several beats, she looks at him, he shifts embarrassed.
Some code insisting that he can't leave until she
dismisses him.

AURORA
(continuing low)
You don't even know that you're
going to miss me.

GARRETT
Look, I don't want to blow smoke
up your ass.

AURORA
What a relief.

GARRETT
It's just that I'm starting to feel
an obligation here that makes it rouch,
especially when I live right next door.
I started to feel like I had to watch
what I was doing in my own house. I
hope you know that my feelings for
you are...

She is nakedly pained and angry as she looks at him.
It's unsettling and there is a trace of real anguish in
GARRETT as he awkwardly exits. We hold on AURORA

for a beat then:

As her car pulls up, the kids run to see their father.
FLAP emerges from inside and embraces the boys, moves
over to greet MELANIE, all the while avoiding contact
with EMMA.

FLAP
{conciliatory to Emma)
I've been packing for us all week.

FLAP kisses MELANIE who reacts with delight.

EMMA
She sure remembers her daddy.

FLAP
You going to stay mad?

EMMA

Yes, I thought being uprooted with
my children without my consent was
at least worth a pout.

She digs into her purse and hands him some Kleenex
which he uses with his back to her.

SAM BURNS

Don't know what I'll do.
EMMA
Oh, my.
SAM

I bought a going away thing for

Dottie's right. I'm a born bumbler.

EMMA
Oh, you are not.

SAM BURNS

Wiping away some tears, she goes through the junk of
her glove compartment hurriedly, opens her wallet.
And removes a picture.
“EMMA

She wanted her daddy to see her

The young woman turns, the same young woman EMMA caught
FLAP with in Des Moines, JANICE. EMMA looks at her,
now certain who she is.

EMMA
How long have you been here or
are you the reason we moved to
Nebraska?

JANICE
I think Flap should talk to you.
I've been telling him sc. I
shouldn't say anything before he
does, except that I don't think
there's an emotion you're having
that I couldn't validate.

EMMA
Well, if he wants to talk, just
tell him his wife and his baby
will be at the doctor's getting
their flu shots.

DR. BUDGE is an overweight version of a Norman Rockwell
G.P. He has just finished giving MELANIE her shot and
she is erying and screamins.

EMMA
Come on, Melanie. It's all over.
If it makes you feel better, I
have to get a shot now myself.

MELANIE calms and smiles. The doctor swabs her arm
and then begins moving it, looking underneath. EMMA
indicates a box of lollypops.

EMMA
(to doctor)
Can I give Melanie one of these?

The dector nods and continues to examine her. Then stops,

his attention focuses on her arm. EMMA leans to give
the lollypop to MELANIE.

How long has it been there?

EMMA
I don't know. Melanie, stop
kicking that cabinet.

MELANIE gives the metal file cabinet one more little
kick, then stops.

DR. BUDGE
There are two of them, not very
big though. I have to be out of
town for a week and I hate to
leave them that long because
they're going to have to come
out and be looked at.

EMMA
Goodness. Do I have to be scared?

DR. BUDGE
All it means if you're scared is
that you'll be that much happier
when it turns out to be nothing.

EMMA nods, managing a smile. She takes MELANIE by

the hand.
MELANIE
Mommy should get a pop too. For her
shot.
EMMA

That's richt.

The doctor hands her one. She unwraps it and puts it
in her mouth.

EMMA
Sure. So I shouldn't worry, right?

AURORA
It’s a cyst--it's right where your
oil glands are and they've stopped
up because you've never learned
what to eat or how to wash.

was that he wanted to do it so fast.
Janice--straight hair.

I'm going to get myself one of

VERNON

They're taking a biopsy.

GARRETT grimaces broadly as if just suffering an
incredibly sharp stomach pain.

AURORA
What's wrong with you?

GARRETT
Sorry.’ Nothing. I'm squeamish
about words like "biopsy". It's
just a thing with me. Go ahead.
I'm sorry.

But his expression remains enormously strained. VERNON
looks at him with distaste.

VERNON
Let's go inside.

He starts to escort her away, then turns to GARRETT.

VERNON
I don't know why you'd feel squeamish
about anything. Didn't you fellas

The East River traffic just a few feet away, the
Brooklyn Bridge overhead, the city beyond, a piano
player at work on the atmosphere. There isn't a Welsh
coal miner who wouldn't instantly guess which of the

five women was the rube. EMMA is out of her element,

but there is enough inner security to make her only
vaguely uncomfortable in the midst of these well-groomed,
seemingly-sure-of-themselves contemporaries.

PATSY

Emma, this is Lizbeth.

Hi, Elizabeth.

LIZBETH
Hi. It's Lizbeth.

EMMA,

EMMA

Can you just tell them it's okay to
talk about cancer? I mean it's not
so terrible. In less than two hours

had abortions and three of them had
been divorceaé and how one of them
hasn't spoken to her mother in four
years and how one of them has her
“little Natalie” at boarding school

okay to talk about...

Oh, and there was the one with the

EMMA
It is okay.

EMMA
What kind did he have?

PHIL
Skin cancer.

Before she can say anything.
PHIL

I knew. That's the best kind.

I'd really like to take you out
sometime.
EMMA

I'm sorry. I have to go back very

Broadway shows and things--and I'm
married and have three kids--and
there is the cancer.

PHIL
Yeah, I figured it was a long shot.

Fine.

EMMA picks up the phone and begins to dial.

MEG
Will you tell Tommy I said hi?

EMMA .
I'll do better than that. I'll
tell him you have a crush on hin.

MEG
Aunt Emma, you wouldn't.

EMMA laughs, then hangs up the phone, thinks for a
beat, then:

EMMA
Mec?

MEG
Uh-huh?

EMMA

From your point of view, having
lived in three or four places,
how is it being in New York?

MEG
Well, I think it’s my favorite
because no matter what you're
fond of, they have it.

EMMA
Not if you like nature.

MEG
Yes. Because we “ave a house in
East Hampton that's right on the
ocean and has woods out behind.

Melba, there are certain options
you have to consider on the kind
of treatment we'll be following.
We need to decide whether to operate.

MELBA
What do you think, Dr. Maise?

DR. MAISE
Well, the problem is that if we
don't operate, the chances are
one in four of achieving a cure.
But if we operate, the chances
of a cure become one in two.

MELBA
(heartened)
Oh.

DR. MAISE
But the chances of survivine
the operaticn are two in three.

MELBA
Oh. So if we just keep on doinc
what we're doing, my chances are
one in three.

DR. MAISE
(correcting)
One in four.
MELBA
One in four--sorry.
DR. MAISE
That's okay.
MELBA

What's one in three?

DR. MAISE
There is no one in three. The
chances of surviving the operation
are two in three.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT 216

As a cab leaves AURORA off at her hotel. The sion
contains a provocative message: “Home of the Pleasure
Dome."

INT. HOLIDAY INN + NIGET. 217

As AURORA walks past the reception desk where first by
din and then by actual sight we see:

INT. PLEASURE DOME - NIGHT ‘ 218

A monument to a certain type taste. It has a giant
indoor area with a sweating indoor pool, some matted
and torn artificial turf serving as a miniature golf
course, ping-pong tables, shuffleboard and scores of
pinball machines, all of it covered by a plastic top
creating an eerie translucence. Most of the rooms at
this Holiday Inn have balconies facing out on the
Pleasure Dome. So it is a weary AURORA we see climb
up to the balcony and open the door to one of these
rooms.

pinball bells which cannot be shut out. She sits
on the bed.

INT. EMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 220

AURORA, dressed colorfully, is supervising the two men
hancing AURORA'S Renoir and Klee. She also squeezes
her armpit periodically. EMMA is in bed. She is
genuinely cheered by the additions.

EMMA
(leoking at paintings)
I can't believe you did this.

AURORA
Sure.
(to men)
Be careful. Those paintings are
worth more than you'll make in your
lifetime.

The men turn and react.

EMMA
(sotto)
You treat them like that, they're
going to start pissing in my soup
to get even.

INT. HOLIDAY INN COFFEE SHOP ~ NIGHT 221

AURORA eating a desultory meal with VERNON. There is
so little to say. He is concerned for her. She
catches him looking at her at one point as she
unconscicusly squeezes her armpit. She stops anc
pats his hand in reassurance.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT 222

AURORA at the nurse's station. There is a large clock
rominent in the background which reads seven minutes
past eight. AURORA is extraordinarily agitated, hyper,

manic.

You act like...

AURORA
She only has to hold out till

NURSE
Your attitude isn't...
AURORA
We'll talk later. Give her the shot.
NURSE

her outburst. The nurse scurries towards EMMA'S room.

INT. EMMA'S ROOM - DAY 223

EMMA lying in bed, the doctor sitting at her bedside.
EMMA looking intelligent and relaxed despite the
doctor's words. His manner is not the least bit
emotional. A professional rendering facts.

DR. MAISE
The response to the drugs we've
tried isn't what we'd hoped. But
there are investigatory drugs which
we are willing to utilize. However,
if you become incapacitated or it
becomes unreasonable for you to
handle your affairs for a block of
time, it might be wise to make some
decisions now so that your areas of
responsibility don't become notably
disordered.

TOMMY calls to his brother from the pool.
TOMMY
Pushing Grandma in isn't a half
bad idea.
AURORA

You'd better not. I'm not kidding.
Push your father in if you want.

element, and still trying to postpone fully dealing
with EMMA'S condition.

EMMA
God, how I miss washing this mane of
hers. Wherever did she get it from?

ROSIE

Oh, you and your thing about hair.

They hug again holding each other's rears.

AURORA starts away from him, stops. 236

He stops, she walks to him.

AURORA
I can't help being curious. Do you
have any reaction to my telling you
that I love you?

GARRETT
IT was just inches from a clean getaway.

AURORA
Well, you're stuck now so you might
as well face up. You're old enough
to tell and I'm old enough to hear

EMMA
Oh, everything isn't always about

AURORA
Let's not fight so much.

EMMA

You don't put any gravy on the
cottage cheese, do you?

WOMAN
You crazy?

AURORA
I'll have some cottage cheese and
some whole wheat toast.

WOMAN -
You want gravy on the toast?

AURORA
No, thank you.

The woman hands her the food. AURORA walks with her tray.
She sees PATSY with the three kids just finishing a meal.
PATSY looks tanned ané gorgeous. They are all wearing

ski clothes. They greet each other. TOMMY, a perfunctory
huc; TEDDY, a squeeze; MELANIE, utterly kissable. TOMMY
puts down a different water glass in front of AURORA.

TOMMY
Can we go back to the shop?

PATSY nods.

PATSY
Wouldn't you know? I take them
away skiing and the most excited
they got is when they found this
novelty section in the gift shop.
De you think they should see
their mother today?

AURORA
I'd wait.
PATSY
I told Emma I thought Melwnie should -”

AURORA did not expect this. She sips her water. rt

AURORA
You don't have the resources,

FLAP
You can't make an argument out of this.

She is growing angry and trying not to. She sips some
water; it rung down her chin. The problem of getting water
to stay in her mouth is beginning to vie for her attention.

AURORA
Raising three children and working
full time and Tunning after women
requires a lot more energy than you
have. You've always had a knowledge
of your own weakness--don't lose that
quality now that you need it most.

years and we did a lot of talking--
and some people don't get that...
Listen, I want you to make a lot of
friends. And don't be afraid of
girls--they're going to be so much
help to you, I swear.

TOMMY
We're not afraid of girls. What
makes you think that?

EMMA

Well, you micht be later on.
TOMMY

I doubt it.
TEDDY

(sobbing to Tommy)
Why don't you just shut up?

TOMMY
(hal f-heartedly)
You shut up.
EMMA
Shhh. Come on. Teddy? Give me

a kiss.

They kiss on the lips. TEDDY kisses her a few extra
times and so does she. She does the last extra

kisses in a way which makes him smile. She gestures
to TOMMY who kisses her cheek cuickly. He is tortured
and somehow being stiff and foul is simpler for him
right now.

EMMA
Tommy, be sweet. Be sweet, please.
Don't keep pretending you dislike
me. That's silly.

TOMMY
(strained)
I like you.

EMMA
Then will you listen to me especially
hard?
. TOMMY
. What?
EMMA
You'll listen close?
TOMMY
I said, what?
EMMA

(petting his arm)
I know that you like me. I know it.
But for the last year or two you've
been pretending you hate me. I love
you a let, as much as I love anybody,
as much as I love myself. And in
a few years when I haven't been
around to be on your tail about
something or irritating you, you're
going to remember my buying your
baseball glove when you thought
we were too broke, and how I read
you these stories and let you goof
off instead of mowing the lawn...
lots of things. You're soins to
realize you loved me. And maybe
you're going to feel badly because
you never told me. Don't. Because
I already know you love me. So you
must not ever do that to voursels.
Okay?

TOMMY pauses. His brother looking at him with hope
and urging that he says "I love you". He doesn't.

TOMMY
Okay.

EMMA
Good. You'd both better run alone
now. Take care. I was scared of
this, but I think it went really
well, don't you?
The boys nod.

AURORA
Come on, your father's back at the
hotel.
MOVING SHOT - CLOSE ON TOMMY 251

As he moves along, glancing back occasionally.
EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY 252

AURORA making conversation to soothe TEDDY who keeps
lapsing unexpectedly into tears or sniffling. TOMMY
lags behind, pausing, looking back at the hospital,
then catching up.

AURORA
You know, I was speaking to this
boy back in River Oaks where I live
and@ he was telling me how great the
Cub Scouts are in Houston, just
about the best there are.

TOMMY
(simply)
We never were Scouts. Our mother
was too lazy to check it out.

AURORA'S hand hits him so hard that he is knocked down
ané several feet away by the blow. MELANIE giggles
nervously. TOMMY starts to scamper away. AURORA

goes after him. He almost runs for it. She has him
by the arm. Finally, he stops strucgling; he starts
crying. AURORA comforts him. Gentler than we've

seen her.

AURORA
That's a boy. I just can't have
you criticize your mother around me.

INT. EMMA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 253

One light on. FLAP dozing in a chair. AURORA seated
across the room, looking at EMMA, who is on even more
life support systems, and now EMMA looks back. Her
mother smiles at her with quiet and mystic reassurance--
their final communication. EMMA turns; AURORA looks

out the window. The door opens, a nurse enters. She
ehecks EMMA. This is the same nurse who had the run-in
with AURORA. She's a bit reluctant to approach her.

She touches FLAP, who awakens.

NURSE
Mr. Horton. She's gone.

FLAP gets to his feet. He looks at AURORA, who rises.

AURORA
i'm so stupid. After all she's been
through, “I thought I'd feel relief
when she went...0h, my sweet little
thing..-
(a wail)
Oh, Emma...please.

She catches herself, looks at FLAP, sadness flowing
again. He stands quite still, something approaching
dignity.
. AURORA .
(continuing)
There's nothing harder, is there?

She looks at FLAP again, a step and they are in each
other's arms, AURORA kisses his brow, he kisses her
pack. They look towards the bed. Then:

AURORA
Let's go.

FLAP opens the door, waits for her; she gestures that
he should go first. An instant where she looks back
from the doorway.

FADE OUT:
{TO END TITLES OVER:
EXT. AURORA'S HOUSE - DAY 254

As the last of the three limousines return from EMMA'S
funeral.

INT. AURORA'S KITCHEN - DAY 255

ROSIE, PATSY and AURORA preparing some food. They argue
with AURORA and each other about who should not be
doing this.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 256

GARRETT, VERNON, the BANKER, the DOCTOR, TOMMY, TEDDY,
MELANIE, FLAP, PATSY'S husband, MEG, CECIL HORTON and
SAM BURNS, off by himsels, lost until PATSY comes up
and begins to tell him how much EMMA cared about him.
The casual, mournful, unstructured conversation of our
characters, as they drink, eat and talk about EMMA and
inevitably about her mother as well. This to continue
as we finally...

FADE OUT.
