INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM ~ NIGHT

TWO LITTLE GIRLS, sound asleep. It’s 1974. A poster of

the Banana Splits on the wall. A BALLERINA MUSIC BOX is
TINKLING “Lullaby and Good ge” while the ballerina
Cwirls before the mirror. All's right with the world.

CUT TO:
A FRESCA BOTTLE being dug out from a trash can by FEMALE
HANDS. Wiped off with a wide, 70’s-style cuff. .

INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

The ballerina’s tinkling. One girl rolls over, clutching
a@ Snoopy. This is GWEN, S$. Her face is angelic.

CUT TO:
A VODKA BOTTLE is dug from behind a row of books. Vodka

is Poured into the Fresca bottle. It goes all over the
table. Whoever’s pouring has already had quite a few.

cuT TO:
INT, GIRLS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

The ballerina finishes her song. Just _as she’s resuming,
the door opens and MOM enters, FRESCA BOTTLE in hand.

MOM
Girls! Get up! It’s magic outside!

She flicks on the light. Mom’s a party girl without the
arty. A fading meauty erying to wring some fun out of
er increasingly dull life. rinking is a start.

Gwen and her sister LILY, 7 squint against the light.

GWEN
I’m tired.

Mom goes to rustle them out of bed.

MOM
Nonsense. Come on, lazyheads. Get up
and go get your sleds. Right away.

LILY
We don’t have sleds.

MOM
You don’t?
(they shake their heads}
Well then we’ll just have to
improvise.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

She pulls out a drawer and DUMPS the clothes out, onto
the girls. They LAUGH as the clothes rain down on them.

EXT. MOM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A cheep New Jersey row house on top of a hill. Nothing
special about it. Although everything looks a little
special when it’s SNOWING like this. Snow covers the
road. Puffs of it float down under the streetlights.

Mom, Gwen, and Lily are each sitting in a DRESSER DRAWER
in the middle of the street. The girls are in parkas,
boots and nightgowns, with excited looks on their faces.
Gwen has Snoopy with her. Mom hasn’t put on a coat.

MOM
Ready, set -- GO!

They PUSH OFF and start down the hill. WHEEE! The
drawers skid over bumps, carom against snowbanks. The
girls and Mom LAUGH and SCREAM as they gain speed.

At the bottom of the hill, they SLAM into a snowbank .and
spill into the snow. They all LAUGH hysterically.

MOM
Hey, do we know how to have fun, or do
we know how to have fun?

LILY
We know how to have fun.

As they dig their drawers out of the snowbank:

MOM
And that’s what matters, right? Cause
if you’re not having fun, peanuts --

LILY/GWEN
(a familiar refrain)
-- what’s the frigging point?

MOM
Exactly. What’s the frigging point?

They all put their drawers on top of their heads and head
back up the hill.

INT. MOM’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Mom is asleep on the floor in last night’s sledding
clothes. Gwen and Lily are squatting next to her in
school uniforms. Gwen blows on her face. No reaction.
Lily pinches her cheek. Nothing. Gwen pinches harder.
Nada. Lily hauls off and SLAPS Mom HARD. Mom GRUNTS and
rolls over. Satisfied she’s alive, Lily and Gwen leave.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Gwen and Lily are sitting,

AUNT HELEN.
cinched belt,

Everything about Aunt Helen is tight:
her pursed lips.

PRINCIPAL

I’m afraid your Aunt has some bad
news.

AUNT HELEN

It’s your mother. She’s passed.

Her voice is

facing the PRINCIPAL and their

her

cold. A woman with little love for either
children or drunks.

Lily understands immediately. Her face goes blank.
Gwen’s younger. She doesn’t get it.

GWEN

It’s okay, she does that all the time.
Just slap her real hard and she‘’ll
wake up.

Not
on.

AUNT HELEN

Gone.

GWEN

Gone where?

Helen looks to the Principal for help.

PRINCIPAL

Sometimes, qirts. God looks down at

all his chi

dren, and sees one that

He’d like to have with Him in Heaven.
fe that’s what He does. He ... moves
them.

(beat)

That’s what He did with your mother.
He moved her to Heaven.

Gwen thinks about this long and hard. Finally:

GWEN

He better have Fresca there.

But
INT. CHURCH - DAY

ORGAN MUSIC. About FORTY MOURNERS are in the pews. Aunt
Helen enters, holding Gwen and Lily’s hands. hey sit in
a pew and take off their coats. Aunt Helen PRAYS.

Gwen sits there for a beat, CLACKING her heels together.
She CLACKS her feet against Lily’s. But Lily yanks her
feet out of range and looks the other way.

Gwen sits there a beat more. Then she notices the CASKET
on the altar. She stares at it. Then, with Aunt Helen
still bent in prayer, she gets up walks toward it. .
Gwen marches up to the casket, gets up on her fippy-toes,
and looks in. There’s Mom, laid out ail peaceful. Gwen
stares for a moment. Then:

GWEN
HEY!

Aunt Helen looks up. Sees Gwen peering in the casket.

GWEN (cont’d)
She’s not in Heaven! She’s RIGHT
HERE!

AUNT HELEN
Sweet Jesus --

Aunt Helen jumps up out of the pew, mortified.

GWEN
You said she was in Heaven! You said
she MOVED!

As Aunt Helen picks Gwen up and carries her out of the
church, Gwen calls out to the other mourners:

GWEN (cont'd)
Look for yourself! She’s right there!

INT. AUNT HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A weird, unfamiliar house. Gwen watches AUNT HELEN,
whose irritation is palpable, making up a sofabed. Lily
sits in a corner, staring into space.

GWEN
I didn’t mean to ruin it.

Aunt Helen doesn’t respond. Just tightens her hospital
corner. When she’s done with the bed:

AUNT HELEN
I cleared out that chest there. You
can use it for your clothes.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

; _ AUNT HELEN (cont‘d)
This is just for now. Till we figure
out something more permanent.

She gives them each AN AWKWARD PAT on the head and
LEAVES.

Lily opens her suitcase and starts unpacking. Gwen
watches, then pulls out a drawer and looks at it for a
moment. She pulls it all the way out and looks at the
METAL RUNNER along the bottom. he looks up at Lily.

GWEN :
Hey. This one’s probably really fast.

Lily looks at her. Suddenly, a cold, angry little girl

LILY
It’s not a sled. It’s a drawer. Put
it back.

Gwen looks at Lily, neatly filing her clothes away, and
thinks about this. Finally, she puts the drawer back and
starts unpacking. Then, under her breath:

GWEN
It’s a sled. I'm just using it as a
drawer for now.

CUT TO:
MAIN TITLES.

CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY

Loud. Dirty. And from the look of the graffiti and
billboards, PRESENT DAY. A JACKHAMMER starts.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - PRESENT - DAY

TWO BODIES are crashed on a mattress on the floor. The
apartment,s a tiny, cruddy studio.

On A SMALL, DISORGANIZED DESK, a LAPTOP COMPUTER is open
and on. Next to it is a copy of the “Manhattan Weekly”
newspaper, open to a column called “Cummings and Goings”.
The byline says, “by Gwen Cummings”, The photo is of
Courtney Love giving the camera the finger.

BEER CANS and VOOKA BOTTLES spill out of a trash that
desperately needs dumping. Dirty dishes fill the sink.
The TV is on, with the sound turned off. Cartoon animals
chase each other across the screen.

The only tidy things in the place are a SUIT and a GREEN
VELVET DRESS hanging in plastic on the back of the door.

The JACKHAMMER noise rattles the building. One of the
heads stirs. We hear a PAINED FEMALE GROAN.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Another JACKHAMMER joins in. A TRUCK backs up. BEEP
BEEP. The other body moves; its voice is deep and groggy.

JASPER

(equally weak}
Jackhammers. Saturday. Bad.

The statement hangs in the air. Then the woman‘’s head
ops up, alarmed. It‘s GWEN, all grown up -- more or
ess -- again. She's 30, naked, and very hung over.

GWEN
Fuck. Saturday.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY

Gwen is half-in the green dress, rinsing her armpits at
the sink. Her hands are shaking.

GWEN
What'd we do last night?

JASPER (0.S.)
Little of everything, looks like.

Jasper comes in, drinking a beer, pulling on suit pants
without underwear. He’s the kind of guy who manages to
twinkle no matter how bad the hangover.

GWEN
Did we have fun, at least?

JASPER
I’m choosing to believe yes.

Gwen grabs about five aspirin from the medicine cabinet

GWEN
Never again, Jasper.

JASPER
Never again.

She pops the aspirin, grabs the beer, takes a big pull.
EXT. NEW YORK, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY

Gwen and Jasper tumble out of the building, semi-dressed.
They hail a CAB and climb inside.

GWEN
Grand Central. Fast.

EXT. NEW YORK - DAY
The taxi speeds downtown, slams into a cavernous pothole.

INT. TAXI - DAY

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Jasper and Gwen, still getting dressed, go flying.
Gwen’s head smacks the roof of the cab.

GWEN
Ow! Jesus --
(to the Cabbie)
Hey, alive. fast and alive. The
alive part is very --

(then:)
Damn it!

In the bump, Gwen has poked a finger through her
stockings, ripping a big hole, ruining them.

GWEN
{to Cabbie)
Excellent, thank you. That’s perfect.

As she throws the stockings out the window, she notices
Jasper’s shirt. It’s a ratty, old I-Love-NY T-shirt,

GWEN
That’s what you're wearing?

JASPER
I couldn’t find my good one.
(off her unamused look)
Hey, at least it has a heart on it.
The taxi lurches, sending them both into the ceiling.
EXT. GRAND CENTRAL - DAY
The taxi pulls up in front of the station.
INT. GRAND CENTRAL - DAY
Gwen and Jasper run across the lobby.
INT. GRANO CENTRAL, TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
Gwen and Jasper get on the train just as the doors close.
INT. TRAIN - DAY

Gwen and Jasper, very QUIVERY, are looking for seats.
Ahead, the CONDUCTOR is taking a PASSENGER’s ticket.

PASSENGER
Where’s the bar car?

CONDUCTOR
Three cars that way.

He points over Gwen and Jasper’s shoulders. They do an
immediate about-face and head that way.

EXT. BEDFORD, NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - DAY

The train arrives. Gwen and Jasper spill out of it in

HYSTERICS, VERY WELL-OILED. |
EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A small, white church, Wildflower arrangements by the
door. Lots of CARS in the parking lot. A SOLE
BRIDESMAID, also in green velvet, is waiting out front.

INT. CHURCH - OAY

More wildflowers inside. 70-odd GUESTS are all seated, .
waiting for a wedding.

ANOREW, the handsome, lawyer groom, is at the altar with
his BEST MAN and the MINISTER. He checks his watch, then

catches eyes with his PARENTS -- stuffy GOP’ers -- who
are by the door, They shoot him a questioning look --
what's going on? He shrugs -- beats me.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A TAXI pulls up. Gwen and Jasper spill out of it, still
LAUGHING, and land right in front of the Bridesmaid.

BRIDESMAID
You're late.
GWEN
Jasper, this is ... what’s her name.
BRIDESMAID
Really late, Gwen. Like, 45 minutes
late.
GWEN

She has absolutely no sense of humor
but she’s really good at telling time.

The Bridesmaid drags Gwen inside.
INT. CHURCH - DAY

As the Bridesmaid drags Gwen off to the Bride’s room,
Jasper saunters in, kisses Andrew's Mother’s hand.

JASPER
How do you do. Pleasure.
(to Andrew’s Father)
Sir. An honor.

He kisses Andrew’s Father’s hand too. They both seem a
little. disconcerted.

ANDREW'S MOTHER
And you are ...?

JASPER

(whispers)
The bride’s lover. Ssh.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

He winks at them, snaps a flower off an arrangement, and
Sticks it in his lapel as he find himself a seat.

INT. BRIDE‘S ROOM - DAY

LILY, 32, is the impatient bride. She’s standing with a
SECOND BRIDESMAID when Gwen enters.

GWEN
Sorry. There was a water main break,
and then the train got stopped in Rye,
some electrical something, and --

Lily turns to her, livid.

LILY
You know what I can’t figure out?
Which pisses me off more: your being
late, or your coming at all.

GWEN
What do you mean? This is your big
day -- of course I’m gonna be here --
LILY
Right, to watch me marry -- how was it
you put it last night? -- “a guy with

as much personality as a tube sock.”
On Gwen, horrified, as the memory hits her:

INT. BAR ~ NIGHT

Late last night. Gwen, Jasper and TEN FRIENDS are at a
table, SLOPPY-ORUNK. While everyone talks at once, Gwen
YELLS into her CEL PHONE.

GWEN
I’m not saying he’s the most boring
person on Earth, Lil, but --
{to her noisy bar-mates)
Do you MINO? This is IMPORTANT!
(back to the phone}
-- but as your only living relative, IT

think it’s my duty to te you ...
(whispers)

«+. he’s the most boring person on

Earth.

INT. MAIN HOUSE, FRONT ROOM - DUSK

Gwen simultaneously mortified by, and trying to cover up,
the memory.

GWEN
Oh -- you thought I was -- cause that
was a joke, I was -- I was joking.

Lily levels her unforgiving gaze at Gwen.

(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:

LILY
Gwen? When you're old and alone and
you have nothing to do on holidays
because you've alienated everyone
you‘ ve ever met, I want you to
“remember these words: You make it
impossible to love you.

She hands Gwen a bouquet and swooshes out, followed by
her two other Bridesmaids. Gwen stands there a moment. |

GWEN
Fuck.

INT. CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY
Procession time. Gwen is waiting her turn. After a
moment, she discreetly pulls a BOTTLE OF PILLS out of her

pocket, pops a couple, washes them down with Holy Water,
then heads up the aisle.

INT. CHURCH, ALTAR - DAY

Gwen is standing with Lily, Andrew, the Minister, and the
Best Man. Lily and Andrew KISS. Gwen's head bobs around
like one of those bouncy-neck dolls in the back of a car.

INT. INN - DAY

Reception. A SMALL BAND is playing Lester Lanin-like
wedding music. Some tame wedding dancing going on.
Lily and Andrew are greeting people in a receiving line.

Gwen and vasper snake through the crowd holding big, fat
drinks, still loopy. Their speech is loose and jangly.

GWEN

Did you see me? No mistakes. No
criseses. I did everything right.
JASPER

You say that like it’s a good thing.

A WAITER passes with some puffy hors d’oeuvres. Instead
of taking one, Gwen takes the whole tray from him.

GWEN
It isn’t?

As Jasper talks, Gwen eyes the hors d’oeuvres hungrily.
But she has a drink in one hand and the tray in another.
The only way to eat them is to pick them up off the tray
with her tongue. So that’s what she does.

JASPER
No. Nobody wants to come away from a
wedding with memories of perfection
and beauty. They want to bring home a
story ...

(CONTINUED)
li.
CONTINUED:

NEARBY, some GUESTS spot Gwen drunkenly licking cheese
puffs off the tray. Whispers, pointing. “The sister.”

JASPER (cont’d)
+--+ Something juicy. Like the one
~ about the groom who ran off with the
maid of honor. Or the bride whose
tits fell out of her dress during the
ceremony.

He leans forward and licks an hors d’oeuvre off too.

ACROSS THE ROOM, Lily sees them eating off the tray like
a couple of dogs. Then she spots Andrew's Father among
the people staring, and is mortified.

JASPER
{mouth full)
That’s all anyone wants out of life,
Gwennie. A good story.

GWEN
(mouth full)
You think?

JASPER
Not if it can be avoided. Come on,
this is a party. Let’s have some fun,
for Christ's sake.

He takes the tray and puts it on a chair, not seeing
Andrew’s Mother 1s about to sit down on the very same
chair. SQUOOSH, SPLAT. As Andrew’s Mother reacts,

Jasper and Gwen hit the dance floor without noticing
they’ ve horrified yet another entire group of guests.

ON THE DANCE FLOOR, couples are dancing tastefully. But
Gwen and pasper change ail that. They land on the dance
floor with all the decorum of a neutron bomb. Normally,
Jasper’s a good dancer, but as drunk as he is, he’s just
a safety hazard. Every time he SPINS Gwen, she THWACKS
into another Dancer. Bam! Bam! Bam! Backs whacked,
toes stepped on, hats knocked off. Not that Jasper and
Gwen even notice. They’ re having fun, for God's sakes.
He throws her over his head. Her shoe flies off and hits

a woman. He slides her under his legs. Her dress flies
up -~ who cares?

ALL AROUND THE RECEPTION, people stare at them. From her
place on the receiving line, Lily sees the display, sees
everyone talking and Pointing. She starts over to the

dance floor, to pet an end to it

Just then, Jasper spins Gwen, but instead of holding on
to her, he accidentally lets her hand slip out of his.
She goes flying across the dance floor

+++ RIGHT INTO THE WEDDING CAKE, being wheeled past by

some CATERERS. SPLAT! CRASH! Gwen tumbles to the floor

in a pile of velvet and butter cream.

Everyone freezes. Gwen turns and sees everyone staring
er

at her. Sees Lily starting to cry. She scrambles to
eet.

GWEN
Tfll ... rceplace that.

She staggers away, dripping butter cream in her wake.
EXT. INN - DAY

A CHAUFFEUR is wandering around the driveway, smoking.
Gwen stumbles out, swatting at her dress, trying to get
the frosting off. Finally, she gust unzips the dress,
drops it on the ground, and climbs into the nearest car:
the Limo. She starts it up.

CHAUFFEUR
Hey!

He runs up to the car, just in time to catch a glimpse of
GWEN IN HER UNDERWEAR putting it in drive and taking off.

EXT. BEOFORD RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

The Limousine 200MS and WEAVES down the road.
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

Gwen zooms down the road, looking around.

GWEN
Cake store, cake store, cake store.

The Limo swerves around a bend and slams a Stop sign.

Gwen turns around to see what she hit ...

GWEN

EXT. BEOFORD RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

The Limo takes out the picket fence in front of a CHURCH.
EXT. BEDFORD HOUSE - DAY

At the end of the block sits a little white RANCH HOUSE,

and loses control of the car. BUMP, up the curb.
EXT. BEDFORD HOUSE - DAY

The Limo hurtles up the lawn. The LAWN JOCKEY flies
through the air.

EXT. ANOTHER BEDFORD STREET - DAY

This street is quiet. An OLD STATION WAGON is toodling
along at an ultra-safe speed.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

An ELDERLY MAN is hunched up close to the steering wheel.
His ELDERLY WIFE is beside him, wearing a “Disneyworld” t-
shirt over her dress. There are suitcases in the back.

ELOERLY WOMAN
I bet you forgot to put in the bulbs.

ELDERLY MAN
That’s right, Mother, I let it all go
to heck. You won’t even recognize it.

He chuckles and turns into his driveway. Then he STOPS
SHORT when he sees his house: the lawn’s shredded; the
tail of the Limo, complete with “JUST MARRIED” sign, is
sticking out of his destroyed living room window.

As the Elderly Man and his wife get out of the‘car,
aghast, their front door opens. Gwen staggers out, blood
dripping down her face and onto her scantily-clad body.
GWEN
{slurred}

Hey. Old people. Where cI get a

A STATION WAGON with a HOME-MADE TAXI SIGN pulls off the
interstate and slowly heads up the long dirt drive,

INT. TAXI _- DAY
The DRIVER checks his rear view mirror and sees:

Gwen, staring eut the window, watching the center come
closer and closer. She has a bruised forehead and some
stitches near her hair. A suitcase is beside her.

EXT. 8LUE RIOGE REHAB CENTER, PARKING AREA - DAY

The taxi pulls out, leaving Gwen in the cloud of dirt.
She has on jeans and a coat that’s missing its buttons.

Gwen pulls the coat tight around her and looks around --
at the buildings, the ducks on the pond, the winter sun
Playing off the hills in the distance. Through the doors
to the Main Building, she sees an ADMISSIONS sign.

The door to a dorm opens, and a rag-tag group of FIFTEEN
PEOPLE, all ages, races, genders, emerges. hey gather
in a circle and MUMBLE for a bit, then SCREAM:

CHANTERS
TOGETHER! WE'RE BETTER! WE'RE
BETTER! TOGETHER! NOOOOOO0O DRUGS!

Gwen stares, horrified, as they break up and head toward
the Main Building. She digs her cel phone out and dials.

JASPER (0.S.)
(very sleepy)
Yeah.

GWEN
Huge mistake, Jasper. Massive.

JASPER (0.S.)
Hey. Good morning.

GWEN
Ha. Easy for you to say. I should
have picked that place in the city.

JASPER (0.S.)
What about all that “I don’t wanna run
into anyone I know” bullshit?

GWEN
I was wrong. This place is horrible.
It’‘s miles away from anything, the
people chant, and, oh, guess what,
there’s no booze or drugs.

JASPER (0.S.)
The people what?

Because this place is a fucking

Could be worse. Could be prison.

GWEN
Is that worse?

JASPER (0.8.)
You never hear of anyone being raped
with a plunger in rehab.

GWEN

Maybe it’s covered up. Maybe rehab is
the plunger-rape capital -- HEY!
Her cel phone is snatched from her hand. She turns to
see BETTY MARQUETTE towering over her. Betty’s a big
woman ~- about 6/1”, mid-40's, with zero sense of humor.
GWEN

Excuse me, I was talking!

BETTY
No cel phones.

Betty turns and heads into the main building.

BETTY
Get your own bag there. This isn’t
the Sheraton.

Gwen picks up her bag and follows.
INT. MAIN BUILDING, OFFICE - DAY

Betty tosses Gwen’s cel phone into a box, then rifles
through Gwen's suitcase, which is OPEN on a desk.

BETTY

Are you insurance or self-pay?
GWEN

Well -~ seeing as I don’t happen to

have ten thousand dollars sitting

around just now, yeah, insurance will
be helping out.

Betty hands Gwen a stack of INSURANCE FORMS then goes
back to the suitcase. As Gwen looks the forms over,

Betty sets Gwen's LAPTOP in the box with the cel phone.

GWEN
Hey, whoa, I need that.

| BETTY
No you don’t.

GWEN
Oh, yes I do. I have a column to
write. It’s very important.

BETTY
Those aren’t the kinds of things we
want you worrying about here.

GWEN
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll just choose what
to worry about. That always works.

Betty pulls out a BUDWEISER T-SHIRT, adds it to the box.

GWEN
I sleep in that.

BETTY
Not here, you don’t.

Betty roots around some more, sniffing Gwen’s toiletries.

GWEN
Tell you what, Betty. was it?, while
you're going through my things, what
say [ go through yours?

Gwen tries the drawer. It’s locked. Betty shakes a
shoe. TWO PRESCRIPTION BOTTLES fall out.

GWEN
That’s ... for back pain.

Betty dumps them in the box with all the other things.

BETTY
These will all be returned to you when
you check out. Except the Vicodin,
which will be flushed. Smile.

FLASH! She takes Gwen's Polaroid, then hands her a
HOSPITAL GOWN.

BETTY
Open to the back.

Plenty of sunshine, comin’ my way ...

ID bracelet on Gwen's wrist.

BETTY
No drugs or alcohol, obviously. No
isolating -- that’s sitting around in

your room, feeling sorry for yourself.
No phone calls, except on visiting
days, and then only for ten minutes.
No fraternization -- that’s romance
and/or sex between patients.

Betty opens the door to the dorm for Gwen. As she enters:

GWEN
Zip-a-dee doo dah, zip-a-dee ay.

INT. PARKER HOUSE, GWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Like a Holiday Inn room. A SKINNY TEENAGE GIRL is lying
on a bed, reading the Big Book. This is ANDREA. She has
dark roots showing under her bleached hair and a silver
hoop through an eyebrow.

BETTY
Your room. You're responsible for
keeping it clean.
(to Andrea)
Andrea, this is Gwen. Settle her in.

Betty leaves. Andrea looks up from her book.

a moment, then heads into the bathroom.

Gwen watches as they head off toward the cafeteria.

* DANIEL, 45, well-dressed; kind of handsome in an angry,
beat-up kind of way, with a SCAR on his neck;

* ROSHONDA, 35, black, all braids, bosoms, and maternal
instinct.

* OLIVER, 30, Park Avenue party boy, born with a silver
spoon up his nose.

* GERHARDT: 26, German accent and poofy hair; in a tight
T-shirt that says “Denial Is Not Just River In Egypt.”

ROSHONDA

GWEN

Oh. I guess I drink.

OLIVER
Yes! Come to Papa.

As Gerhardt and Roshonda hand Oliver their desserts,
Oliver smiles and WINKS at Gwen. She looks away, toward
Oaniel. The minute her eyes hit him, he barks at her:
DANIEL

DANIEL
How would you know, faggot? You're
about as perceptive as Helen Keller.

OLIVER
Actually, when you think about it,
Helen Keller was probably --

DANIEL
Shut the fuck up.

BOBBIE JEAN
We're all friends, here, Daniel.
Can't we be courteous?

DANIEL
Talk to her. She’s the one staring.

ROSHONDA
It’s his problem, but if I was you,
I'd apologize.

Gwen looks around, sees everyone Staring at her.

GWEN
Sorry. My mistake.

OANIEL
Yeah, no shit.

Bobbie Jean turns to Gwen in her sweetest Southern lawn-
Party way, with a great big smile.

BOBBIE JEAN
Are ya drunk now?

GWEN
Excuse me?

BOBBIE JEAN
I was pickled as a dill cucumber when
I checked in. Can’t even remember my
first meal, which I guess is a
blessing, because they tell me I
passed out in my creamed corn.

He rolls over and starts KISSING her. one hand pushes up
her shirt; the other reaches around to her ass. [It’s
nothing they haven’t done before, but it’s suddenly all
awkward. Their hands feel huge. The room goes quiet.

Gwen's hands twitch uncomfortably on Jasper's back. No
placement feels right. When he yanks her shirt off, she
covers her chest with her arms, oddly shy, Everything's
weird. After an awkward beat, Jasper sits up.

JASPER
Hey. Check it out.

He pulls out a bottle of WILD TURKEY out of his bag.

I_ know, verboten, but you can’t have
tawdry sex in a cheesy Southern motel
without at least one sip of Southern
moonshine. It’s actually against the

He takes a big sip. Gwen Pauses for a moment. Then:
GWEN
Well. Can’t go ending up on the wrong
side of the law.
She reaches for the bottle and takes a HUGE SLUG.

GERHAROT
Oancing is a very important art form.

Okay, that’s it. No way. You are

On one side of the room, Gerhardt is showing Bobbie Jean
how to dance like he does in the club. .

EXT. PARKER HOUSE, PORCH - SAME

Gwen is sitting alone, trying to write her column. But
she can’t focus. Finally, she gets up and goes to:

INT. CAMPUS STORE - NIGHT

Gwen makes her way over to the SELF-HELP BOOKS and looks
them over. She locks in on one: “HOW TO BE YOUR OWN BEST
FRIEND.” She takes it off the shelf. From behind her:

EDDIE
Hey.

Gwen jumps and tries to put the book back, but just ends
up knocking them all over. Eddie comes over to her.

EDDIE (cont’d}
Even I coulda come up with at least

three things that are good about you,
and I only just met you.

He picks up the book, hands it to her, then heads out.

“How to Be Your Own Best Friend” is on Gwen’s nightstand.
Gwen is making her bed extremely neatly.

Andrea emerges from the bathroom. She’s cut off her

EXT. PARKER HOUSE, PORCH - DAY

  
     

Gwen, in Andrea‘’s jeans, is pacing around the porch. She
looks around the visitor-heavy campus and sees:

* Oliver with HIS FATHER, a stern, 60-ish statue of a man
who's writing Oliver a check without looking at him.

* Eddie walking by with a very slick MAN IN AN ITALIAN
SUIT and SUNGLASSES, carrying a briefcase.

* Roshonda’s THREE KIOS running toward her. They jump
all over her. Her ex-husband watches froma distance.

Gwen hears a match strike. She turns to see Daniel alone
in a corner of the porch, lighting a cigarette.

GWEN
Hey, wanna give me one of those?

OANIEL
Get your ecwn.

GWEN

You're just a walking advertisement of

DANIEL

You're no personality primer yourself,

Just then, Jasper BOUNDS up the stairs, carrying a
Balducci’s bag.

JASPER
There she is! There’s my girl!

He throws his arms around her, just like the last time.
They tumble to the ground, but this time, Gwen winces.

JASPER
Yeah, five years, not a peep. And she
stops in her tracks, looks at me, and.
says, in this thick Yiddish accent
“Thanks God you got rid of the girl.
She’ s nothing but bad news.”

He laughs. Gwen stop walking.

GWEN
That’s not funny.

JASPER
Sure, it is.

GWEN
No. Jasper. Anonymous strangers

JASPER
It is, believe me. Everyone I've told
has laughed really hard.
He takes her hand and keeps walking toward the lake.

EXT. ON THE LAKE - DAY
Gwen and Jasper are out on a rowboat. She’s reading her
column in the WEEKLY. He’s unpacking the bag of food.
JASPER
Reads like you were there, doesn’t it?
GWEN
Yeah. Doesn’t make my job feel very
important.

He takes off the Thermos top and starts to pour, but Gwen
grabs it from him and throws it overboard. SPLASH. He
watches it GLUB down to the bottom of the lake.

GWEN
No, it doesn’t. There’s a world of

ive right. They don’t do drugs, and
they don’t drink, and they're happy.

JASPER

That’s a crock of shit. No adult
human being is happy; People are
born, they have a limited time during
which they go around thinking life is
dandy, but then inevitably, at some
point, tragedy strikes, their heart
gets broken for the first time, and
they realize life equals loss, and the
point of the game is to minimize the
pain caused by that equation. Some
people do it by having kids, or making
money, or taking ue coin cotlecting
and telling themselves they're really
jazzed because they snagged a rare

5th century French sou. And some do
it by getting wasted and letting
reality recede into deep focus every
now and again. It’s all the same.

GWEN
Nobody gets hurt if you collect coins.

JASPER

Tell that to the lady whose husband
spent last month’s rent on that French
sou. Everybody hurts everybody. It’s
the human condition.

INT. PARKER HOUSE, TV AREA - NIGHT

Eddie's slumped down on the couch, staring at the Tv.
Gwen wanders in. He PAUSES the TV. Looks up at her.

GWEN
They’ re out of ginger snaps.

Eddie picks the ginger snaps box up off the floor. Gwen
takes it from him and sits next to him. She digs out a
handful and sits there, CRUNCHING away.

Then, very slowly, Gwen closes her eyes and leans her

head over toward Eddie -- ultimately resting it on his
shoulder. His eyebrows pop up, a little Surprised.

They sit there, her with her head on his sheaider, eyes
closed; him sitting there, eyes wide open. Sradually,
her body softens. She starts to relax. Eddie glances
over at her. Then he lifts his hand -- so slowly and
carefully, like a l3-year old guy at the movies -- and
Places it gently on her head.

Her breathing becomes deeper and more peaceful. It’s
like he’s lain a warm blanket over her. They sit there.

Until the PAUSE on the VCR releases. From the TV:

Gwen’s eyes pop open.

GWEN
What the Hell are you watching?

Gwen and Eddie are sitting next to each other. Not

CORNELL (cont'd)
Here's my rule of thumb. When you get

years, the plant and the pet are stiil
alive, then you can think about a
relationship.

INT. PARKER HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

unpleasant. And look at you now.
Okay, well, not right now, cause

GWEN

No, we‘re not. This is not a grou
decision. It’s my business. My life.

ROSHONDA
Hey. we put a lot of energy into that
life in the last couple weeks. We got
a say in how it turns out.

GWEN
The only people who have a say in my
life are the ones who are in it. And
none of you will be. When we leave
here, we're never gonna see each other
again. Or if we do -- say I run into
Oliver on the subway -- f guarantee
we'll pretend we've never met. So,
fine, tell me to give up drinking or
whatever, but don’t you dare tell me
to give up the one friend I have.
Because, know he’s not perfect. but
that’s what Jasper is. The one person
T_know will show up on my birthday and

Full moon. The lake is still and bright. Eddie marches
down the dock carrying the BOX FROM THE ORIOLES, all pert-

BASEBALLS. He HURLS one into the lake. SPLASH!

He hurls another. SPLASH! Hurl. SPLASH! Hurl. SPLASH!
There’s a violence to it -- like he’s throwing punches.
The balls detonate on the surface like little bombs.

Eddie’s looking out at the hundred or so balls bobbing in
the moonlight on the surface of the lake.

INT. PARKER HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Betty’s arranging the mail table again. It’s full of
stacks. As the patients mill about, looking for their
mail, Gwen comes up behind Betty.

GWEN
You don’t have to do it like that, you
know. You could put the mail in our
rooms. Or, if you don’t actually want
to move your ass, put it in one big
heap and let us sort it out ourselves.
There are plenty of alternatives to
these piles, lined up on the table
like a bar graph showing the relative
fullness of everyone’s lives. I know
my life is empty, I don’t need your
God damn stacks to remind me.

BETTY
This is for you.

Betty hands Gwen a letter.
EXT. PARKER HOUSE - OAY

Gwen comes out of the house with the letter. It has the
letter “J” scrawled on in the corner. She opens it.

A YELLOW POST-IT is on_a letter written on “WEEKLY”

She reads the letter. It starts: “Dear Gwen, Having
tried unsuccessfully to reach you by phone ...”

As she reads the letter, her face falls.

clean All-American fun.

He puts down the dumbbells, grabs his towel, to leave.

GWEN

Oh, come on, you can’t still be mad at
me. It’s not allowed.

EDDIE
If I wanna be mad at you, I’m gonna be
mad at you, and there isn’t a damn

hurt, then follows him.

She sags under the weight of the memory.

GWEN (cont’d)
Fuck.

So ... now she doesn’t want anything
to do with me. And how can I blame
her? What have I ever done to deserve

family -- this life, finally -- would
you want to hang onto the disaster
case -- the fucking embarrassment

ou’ ve been lugging around your whole

chance you got.

He sees an overwhelming shame coming over her.

GWEN (cont'd)
I mean, Ged -- why would anyone want
to be associated with an ugly person
like me, if they didn’t have to be?

He steps over to her.

EDDIE
Gwen. You are not an ugly person.

softens her. A rim of tears ecolleces on her lower lids.
Eddie wipes one away, then leaves his hand on her cheek.

They stand there looking at each other. So engrossed
they don’t notice someone watching them. Until that
someone CLEARS HIS THROAT. Gwen and Eddie turn to see
JASPER standing nearby. Gwen steps away from Eddie.

GWEN
Jasper. Wow, what are you -- I didn’t

Jasper looks from Gwen to Eddie, and back again,
JASPER

Looking for you. Betty the Bulldyke
said she thought she'd seen you head

this way.
. GWEN
No, I mean -- I thought you were --
what about visiting your parents?
JASPER

Oh, that. Well, I realized, what with
them both being completely senile, I
could just call in a week, thank them
for the great time, and they'll think
I made the trip.

(beat, pointed:)
See -- I thought you might be lonely.

GWEN
(flustered)
Oh, no, I -- this is just ... Eddie.
Eddie’s here. I mean, he’s a patient
here. He grew up in Oklahoma.

JASPER

Well. How do you do, Eddie from
Oklahoma. I’m Jasper.

He holds out his hand. Eddie shakes it but doesn’t say
anything. Doesn’t like this threesome.

EDDIE
I should go.

JASPER
Oh, now I don’t know about that.

Scenario number one: we let Eddie from
Oklahoma head off to the showers to
wash off all that very many sweat,
and you and I have a nice little
Christmas visit, maybe hum a carol or
two -- basically bullshit our way
through the afternoon. Or, scenario
number.two: we all acknowledge the
awkward situation we find ourselves in
here.

(beat)
Preferences?

GWEN
IT don’t know what you're talking
about.

JASPER
A clear vote for scenario number one.
How about you, Eddie from Oklahoma?
Care to weigh in?

Eddie just looks at him.

JASPER

Abstaining. Interesting. T guess
that leaves only me in favor of
calling a spade a spade, baying it all
out in the open, if you wil and

sa ing, pardon me, s ry but if it’s

all the same to you, I’d prefer it if
you wouldn't fuck my fiancée. :

Eddie holds his gaze. Getting pissed off.

EDOIE
You're way off base, pal.

JASPER
Don’t call me pal. I’m not your pal.
And don’t treat me like a idiot -- do
me that one courtesy, please --
because I'm not that either. I've got
more brain cells than your entire red
neck family all put together, so --

EDOIE
Okay, shut the fuck up.

GWEN
Jasper, don’t be an asshole --

JASPER

arrive at parties sober, not break a
thing while we’re there, and leave
well before things get very; We'll

laundry and be on time and return
library books and floss and replace
toilet paper rolls and deduct ATM fees

JASPER
Grab a chair, God, it’s been --

ELAINE
Forever, I know. Marty's been out of
town and I’ve been finishing my --

She stops short, stares at Gwen.

ELAINE
Did you get a face-lift?

. JASPER

She quit drinking.
Marty and Elaine LAUGH, not believing it for a minute.
Marty waves at the waiter. .

MARTY
Signore -- house red --

Gwen smiles tensely.
FOUR WINE GLASSES CLINK DOWN ON THE TABLE.

While Jasper, Marty and Elaine all talk at once -- the
animated loud chatter of old friends -- Marty fills all
the glasses up. Jasper looks at her for permission.

JASPER
One glass is cool, right?

On the spot, she shrugs a little. What the heli. Jasper
lifts his giass. She doesn’t touch hers.

ANOTHER BOTTLE LANDING ON THE TABLE.

Refills. So much for just one lass. Jasper keeps
drinking. Gwen watches him. It’s like he’s floating
away from her.

Someone delivers a punch line. Marty, Elaine and Jasper
all CRACK UP. Still not drinking, Gwen tries to laug
along, but it doesn’t seem that funny to her. They seem
like they’ re having a much better time than she is.

ANOTHER BOTTLE ARRIVES.

As Jasper pours, he KNOCKS Gwen’s glass of wine onto the
table. It’s HYSTERICAL. Jasper, laine, and Marty all
LAUGH, No one notices that half the glass has spilled
into Gwen’s lap. She looks around at them while she pats
her skirt dry. Suddenly they look awful. Leaden, messy.”

CONTINUED:

Like a bunch of sloppy, pathetic drunks. She feels their
chaos closing in around her and starts hyperventilating.

Jasper puts his arm around her as he launches into a
story. Gwen feels the weight of his arm, his boozy
breath in her hair. She suffers it a moment, then stands.

GWEN
Be right back.

She grabs her bag and coat and gets up from the table.

After a moment, Jasper looks up from his wine and sees

Gwen walking by the window of the restaurant. He gets up.
and follows her.

EXT. DAMIANO’S - NIGHT

Gwen is a few paces down the block when Jasper comes out
of the restaurant in his shirtsleeves.

. JASPER
Hey! Hey --

Gwen stops, turns.

JASPER (cont’d)
What's -- where are you going?

GWEN
IT gotta go.

JASPER
Hang on, come here --

GWEN
No, I gotta go.

JASPER
Why, cause I had two glasses of wine
instead of one? All right. Lesson
learned, it’1l never happen again.
Now let me just go ins pay the bill,

grab my coa and we'll --
GWEN
No. No, yu go back. You were having
fun. I/1l just ...
JASPER
What? What’ re you gonna do?
GWEN
I don’t know. Something else.
JASPER

Something without me.

GWEN
You have all the right intentions,
Jasper: Ina perfect world, that
would be enough. But --

She trails off, shakes her head, and turns and starts
away from him.

JASPER
Gwennie --

But she just bundles her coat tighter around her. and
hurries down the sidewalk.

When she rounds the corner, she slows, suddenly caught by
an overwhelming loneliness. She sits next to a HOMELESS
WOMAN at a bus stop and starts to CRY. :

CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK, MIDTOWN - DAY

Summer now. Heavy air, hot pavements. Lots of traffic
and noise.

EXT. MIDTOWN BUILDING - DAY
An office building.

GWEN (0.58.)
And how old was your father when he
passed, ma’ am?

INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

A rinky-dink office. For a cruddy paper. As we MOVE
down a row of crappy desks, we hear:

GWEN (0.S8.)
Would you like me to indicate the
cause of death? ... Well, we could
just say something like “natural
causes” or “after a long iliness” ...

We FIND Gwen, slumped at a desk, her head leaning heavily
in her hand, taking notes while she talks on the phone.

GWEN {(cont’d)
Long Illness, great ... No, I’m sorry,
I didn’t mean great about the long
illness, I meant ~-- You're absolutely
right, I should be more -- Exactly.
My mistake.

She leans way back in her chair and closes her eyes. On
her desk, beside the phones is her KEYCHAIN. There’s a
FIVE MONTH CHIP attached to it.

GWEN (cont’d)
How about survivors?

EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY

End of the workday. Gwen is one of HUNDREDS of BLANK-
FACED COMMUTERS pouring into the subway station. She

puts on a pair of EARPHONES. They‘ re playing MUSIC.
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

The subway RATTLES its way uptown.

INT. SUBWAY - DAY

It's RATTLING in here too. Gwen_is hanging onto the
strap, listening to her MUSIC. Elsewhere Qn the car, a
YOUNG GUY is blaring RAP from a BOOMBOX; two GIRLS are
chattering loudly; and a GRUMPY OLD GUY is listening to
the BALL GAME on a TRANSISTOR RADIO. Through all the
other noise, we barely hear:

ANNOUNCER (0.S.)
~.. that ends the inning, Philadelphia
leading three-oh, a8 we go into the
top of the sixth.

The subway starts coming to a Stop. On top of all the
other noise, now there’s SCREECHING.

INT. SUBWAY STOP - DAY
The train comes to a stop in the station.
INT. SUBWAY ~- DAY

A big JOSTLE to get out. As Gwen pushes her way to the
door, she walks right by the Old Man.

FROM THE TRANSISTOR RADIO:

COLOR GUY (0.S.)
That’s Foy’s tenth strike-out tonight.
He’s having himself a gene.

ANNOUNCER (0.S.)
And he’s still throwing awfully hard.
That last one was clocked at 98 miles
an hour.

She pushes by. not hearing, because of her Walkman. As
she's about to get out the door, a TEENAGER pushing onto
the train bumps into her, knocking her earphones off.

GWEN
Hey!

Like he cares. As she picks up her earphones,

FROM THE TRANSISTOR RADIO:

She stops, looks at the Old Man. As other passengers
push on and off the train, she goes over to him.

GWEN
Excuse me -- is that -- you're
Listening to --

OLD MAN
Mets. They’ re losing. I don’t wanna
talk about it.

Gwen nods, heads out. Then she stops in the door and
turns back again.

| GWEN
Are they -- is it -- a home game?

OLD MAN
Yeah. Can’t even win at Shea. Putzes.

Gwen smiles, “what do you know”, and gets off the train.
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Gwen steps off takes one step toward the stairs. Then
she stops. Thinks. She turns back to the train, looks
at the open doors. Then they start closing. She dives
and shoves her bag in them. They bounce open again.

She steps back on the train, feeling oddly self-
e

conscious. She goes back over to t Old Man.
GWEN
Sorry to bother you again, but -- this

train does go to the stadium. Right?
EXT. SHEA STADIUM STOP - OAY

Train pulls in. The doors open. Gwen gets off, looks at
the Stadium looming ahead of her, then eads toward it.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM, ENTRANCE - DAY

FANS are leaving as Gwen walks up to the entrance. She
finds an usher.

GWEN
One, please.

He heads away from her. She tries to keep up with him.

GWEN (cont'd)
IT just -- Ifd like to see one of the
players. He’s a friend --

USHER
Yeah, Steinbrenner’s my uncle.

He disappears into the stadium. As she’s wondering what
to do now, a KID, 11, taps her.

KID .
The player parking lot’s around back.
EXT. YANKEE STADIUM, PLAYER PARKING LOT - DAY

A CROWD -- mostly SCREAMING YOUNG BOYS -- is pressed u;
against a CHAIN LINK FENCE, watching the players trickle
out. The Kid carves out a piece of fence for him and
Gwen. He pulls a baseball and a pen out of his pocket.

Gwen keeps her eye on the door watching the freshly-
showered players come out and head for their fancy cars.
As each comes out, the kids at the FENCE all scream his
name, trying to get him over to sign autographs.

Finally, Eddie comes out. Amid a chorus of “EDDIE!*‘s,
he goes over to the fence and works his way slowly down

the line, trying to sign everything. Gwen waits as he
moves his way toward her.

But he stops before he reaches her and heads to his car.
GWEN
No. Wait. Eddie.

(louder)
Eddie --

Not loud enough. He keeps walking away.

GWEN (cont'd)
Eddie!

No luck. Then, from next to her:
KID

Eddie stops, turns around.
KID {(cont’d)

You gotta be loud or they won't hear
you.

Eddie looks at the fence. It’s a sea of SCREAMING FACES.
And then, in the middle of them all, he sees hers. She
waves. He comes up to her.

GWEN
Hi.

EDDIE
Hi.

They gawk at each other a moment.

EDOIE (cont’d)
You were at the game?

: GWEN
No. I just ~- heard you were in town,

BODIE
You came all the way out here and
didn’t even see the game?

GWEN
Well, it was -- kind of -- not at all -
- on my way.

He smiles.
INT. INSIDE SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT

The LIGHTS ARE STILL ON. The GROUNDS CREW is cleanin
up. Gwen and Eddie are sitting on the pitcher’s mound,
facing Home Plate.

EDDIE
See, I told you you’d get a good job.

GWEN
Reality check, Eddie. Making millions
of dollars playing rofessional
baseball is a go Sop. Writing obits
for a crappy rag is not.

EDDIE
You'll find a better one soon. You
get too much going for you not to get
exactly what you want.

GWEN
This from the guy who couldn't even
come up with a third good thing about
me.

He takes a beat, looks at her.

EDOIE
You just keep your mind on what's

GWEN
Keep it simple.

EDOIE
Pretty much. Yeah.

They smile knowingly at each other.

EDDIE
So -- how's it working? You happy at
happy hour now?

GWEN
I don’t know. Happy’s a different
thing, isn’t it?

EDDIE
Yeah.
GWEN
How about you? Are you okay?
EDDIE
Yeah, I’m not bad.
GWEN
But?
EDOIE

I don’t know. I'm having a real good

Season. I haven't slipped.

Everything’s good.

EDDIE

Yeah. And other things.

EDOIE

such a close eye on myself. Like
cutting loose.

He thinks lang and hard about going on. Then finally:

EDDIE
Like you. I miss you.

Gwen smiles. Pleased, but not completely comfortable.

GWEN
This is right about where I’d order @
Vodka straight up.

EDDIE
I think I just broke a sweat.

GWEN
We’re pathetic.

He smiles.

GWEN
You ever wonder what would’ ve happened
if we had met somewhere else? Under
different circumstances?

EDDIE
You mean, before rehab, or after?

GWEN
Either. Both.

EDDIE
Well. Before, we’da probably gorten
naked real quick, I'da been a big
disappointment in the sack, you woulda
puked on my sheets before morning, and
we never woulda gotten each other’s

names.
GWEN
That sounds about right.
EDOIE
After -- I don’t know. I’m not up to

asking girls out yet. I probably
woulda wanted to call you, but instead
some guy I know who has his shit
