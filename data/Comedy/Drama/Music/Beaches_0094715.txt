TITLE SEQUENCE
EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

It is snowing hard. A BUM is pawing through & trashcan
limos and taxis line the street waiting for the crowe to
emerge, DRIVERS stand under the overhang talking to each
other. From inside the theater, we hear thunderous app-
lause. The poster and marquee simply read “BLOOM" in
large, black letters.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

cc BLOOM, at forty-one, has the figure of a thirty-year~
ola, and a wild explosion of red hair surrounds her arrest-
ing face like @& lion's mane. She is dressed in a perfect
black evening gown and is spotlit standing in the center
of an otherwise empty stage, taking bows to a standing
ovation from an opening night CROWD. She exhudes a brash,
outrageous and completely engaging charm.

ec
(into microphone)
Thank you! Thank you:

As the applause continues, she loses her composure and
starts pacing the stage with excitement, a brilliant smile
on her face. ,

ec
You people are too much:
You make being alive worth
the excercise:
(applause con-
tinues)
If you calm down, I'll do
one more song, but that's
it! I'm getting old: I'll
be thirty on my next birthday:

Laughter, then a silence 80 profound you could hear a

pin drop. CC nods at the CONDUCTOR, then we hear the in-
troduction to "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME." CC sings the song
in a pure, rich voice, her phrasing original and moving.
. 2.

When the song ends, she leaves the stage to & standing
ovation.

INT. WINGS - CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

PEOPLE close in on CC to congratulate her. As she moves
slowly through the crowd the STAGE MANAGER pushes his way
to her and hands her a piece of paper.

STAGE MANAGER
Phone message, CC.

cc is still accepting congratulations from people as she
unfolds the paper. . -

EXT, CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

Snow falls in a thick, white cloud. PEOPLE are still ex-
iting the theater, climbing into limos and taxis. Unnoticed
by the crowd, CC rushes from the building, now in street
clothes, still pulling on her fur coat and scarf. An empty
taxi is cruising past. She runs down the street after

it, grabs the door handle, sliding dangerously in the snow,
and runs along with it for a few feet until it skids to

a halt. As she pulls the door open and slides into the
back seat:

ce
(urgent)
La Guardia, please. Bos-
ton Shuttle.

The door slams shut behind her.
INT. TAXI = NiGHT

As ‘the DRIVER starts to pull away, he suddenly turns to
leok at her with a frown.

DRIVER
Hey. Aren't you...

ce
No.

He shrugs and goes back to his driving. CC leans her head
against the window and stares out at the falling snow
anxiously. The only sound is the driver talking softly to
the dispatcher over the radio, tires moving over the cushion
of snow and the windshield wipers slapping back and forth.
Slowly, the sound of people at a beach bleeds in.
TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.
EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - HOT SUMMER DAY ~ 1957

The boardwalk is packed with PEOPLE. A very pretty, meti-
culous-iooking girl of eleven, HILLARY WHITNEY, wearing

a sundress and sandals walks anxiously through the crowd,
scanning her surroundings with a@ panicky expression. She
finally walks over to the railing and looks out over the
beach with despair.

EXT, BEACH - DAY

Hillary slowly descends the stairs to the sand, then sudden-

ly sinks onto the bottom step, puts her face in her hands

and starts crying.
cc

{v.0.)

Don't tell me. You're

lost. I must see a hun-

dred cases like you every

day.

Startled by the childish but oddly mature voice coming
from the darkness under the beardwalk, Hillary quickly
turns, A thread of cigarette smoke drifts out.

ec
(v.0.)
Want a drag?

HILLARY
(wiping tears)
A drag..?

cc

 (V.0.)
On my cigarette. It'll
calm your nerves. .

HILLARY
(upset)
I want to go back to our
hotel, but I can't remem-
ber the name. My mother said..

cc
(cutting in,
bored V.0.)
Big or small?

HILLARY
My mother..?
cc
(exasperated V.0.)
The hotel.

HILLARY
Big.

cc
(v.0.)}
Ritzy or cheap?

HILLARY
I guess it's...ritzy.

(v.0.)

. - Does it have a fountain in
front, a pool inside and a
bunch of fruits in monkey
suits playing violins in the

lobby?
HILLARY
(excited)
Yes:
cc
(v.0.)

You bet your ass it's ritzy.
It's the Marlboro Blenheim.

HILLARY
(shrieking)
That's it! Do you know where
it is?

ce
(resigned V.0.)
Yeah. I*11 walk you back

if you want.

HILLARY
Oh, yes, please...what's your
name?

cc

(dramatic V.0.)
What's my nacre? I am none
other than tre fantastic,
world-famous, cnild-wonder...

An outrageous-looking litte girl of eleven leaps out of
the darkness into the lisnt, still clutching the lit cig-
arette.
cc
cc Bloom:

cc has a mop of wildly curly red hair on her head and

a long, skinny frame with well-developed legs. She is
wearing a red=sequinned leotard, red polish on all nails
and is clutching a pair of glittering red tap shoes.

HILLARY
I'm Hillary Whitney.
cc
(annoyed)
Don't you recognize me?
HILLARY
No.
ce
I do the Mama number in the .

Tony Grant Kiddie Show:

HILLARY
The what...?

ce

Jesus Christ, kid, what plan-
et do you live on? The Tony
Grant Show just happens to be
the most popular show in Atlan-
tie City and I'm the most popular
act in it:

(grudging)
Along with Karen Lewandowski,
the hand-walking queer.

LEONA
(scream V.C.)
cc! Where are you, CC?:

ce
(stubbing cut
: cigarette)
Shit.
(yelling)
Don't blew a gasket, Leona.
I'm down here.

A vulgar-looking FAT WOMAN in her forties appears at the
top of the steps.

LEONA
Thank God: When I couldn't
find you in your dressing
room I thought you were dead:
cc
You watch too many movies,
Leona.

LEONA

We have to get back to the
theater right away: There's
a Hollywood talent scout who
wants to: see your act:

Cc stares at her.

ec
Is this your idea of a sick
joke?

LEONA

No! He caught the midnight
show last night and he's
erazy about you: He‘s looking
for a kid to star in a movie:

cc is suddenly taking the steps two at atime. She pauses
to look over her shoulder at Hillary.

ec
Well, don't just stand
there! C'mon: This is my
break into the big time:

Hillary hesitates for a split-second, then races after CC.
EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

As the two girls rapidly pass Leona in the direction of
the theater:

LEONA
And how many times do I
have to tell you not to
wear your costumes on the
beach?! I'm not made of money,
you know:

cc
Get off my back, Leona:

HILLARY
(soft)
Who is that woman...?

cc
What woman?

Hillary nods over her shoulder toward Leona, who is having
a hard time keeping up because of her weight.

ec
That's no woman, that's
my mother.

Hillary looks away, completely shocked.
INT, THEATER - DAY

While a MAN plays a piano, CC, now fully made-up as well

as in costume, tap dances to the center of the stage, does

a cartwheel and then in perfect control and with very mature
and suggestive gestures, sings in a strong, pure voice. .

ec
(singing)
You gotta see Mama every night
or you can't...
No, you can't...
I said you can't see your Mama
at all:

There is something freakish in both CC's appearance in
adult make-up and in hearing a fully developed voice emerge
from a child's body. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Hillary,
Leona, TONY GRANT, a small, fat man in a cheap suit and
MR. MELMAN, a sleazy-looking character in Sy Devore whites,
as they burst into enthusiastic applause.

TONY
cc! cC'mere and meet Mr.
Melman:

Her face on fire with excitement, CC runs to the edge of
the stage. Just as she reaches it, & STAGE-HAND shoves a
lighted staircase centerstage behind her. CC quickly
glances over her shoulder, then turns back, her face darken-
ing.

cc
Karen Lewandowski's audi-
tioning too?

TONY GRANT
Hey, CC, it wouldn't be fair
not to let...

cc
(sharp)
I thought it was just me,
Leona:

LEONA
It was, sweetie, but Mrs.
Lewandowski found out and...
cc.
(voice rising)
She found out from you,
didn't she?: You were
bragging again, weren't you,
Leona?:

During this,, a perfectly beautiful little GIRL is led on-
stage by her driven MOTHER. Before Leona can reply:

MOTHER
(fawning)
Karen's ready for you, Mr.
Melman.

Mr. Melman is looking past CC at the little girl with de-
lighted surprise.

MELMAN
What a beautiful child:

As the piano starts playing "STAIRWAY TO PARADISE” CC
slowly turns, Singing sweetly, Karen flips herself onto
her hands and starts walking up the lighted staircase.
As CC stares, her eyes fill with tears.

ce
(soft)
Who cares what she looks
like? All she knows how to
do is walk on her hands:

INT, DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Leona tries to calm CC as she hurls herself around the
room, pounding the walls, ripping costumes from racks,
screaming and sobbing hysterically.

cc
It's your fault it happened:
It's your fault they picked
her! It should have been me:
She's like something in a cir-
cus! I wish I was dead: You'll
be sorry when I'm dead? You'll
all be...

Hillary appears holding out a lit cigar helpfully.
HILLARY

cc: I brought you a cigar
from Mr. Melman:
. LEONA
A cigar from Mr. Melman?: Why?:

‘HILLARY
Why else? To calm her nerves.

CC stares at her, then slides along the wall to the floor,
puts her face in her hands and breaks into soft, broken
laughter. Leona watches her anxiously, then:

LEONA
Listen, sweetie, what do you
say we pack it in and go back
to the Bronx? You could hang
out with the other kids at the
pool and we could see Daddy.
Wouldn't that be nice, Ceece?
Don't you want to go home, baby?

Pause, then CC slowly lifts her head with exhaustion.

ce
(soft, lost)
Okay, Leona. Let's go home.

Leona grabs the cigar from Hillary, takes a deep drag and
exhales loudly with relief.

INT. PHOTO MACHINE - SAME DAY

The machine takes several snaps of CC and Hillary in various
poses, CC still in make-up and costume.

INT, MAIN STAIRCASE - MARLBORO BLENHEIM HOTEL - AFTERNOON

cc and Hillary climb the stairs to the mezzanine as Hillary
tears the photo strip in half. CC is still in make-up and
costume and they are in childish high spirits.

HILLARY
You take these and I'll take those.

ec
You're taking the best ones:

HILLARY
(traaing)
I am not, bet you can have them:
(sudden, inspired)
You know what you need? A
theme song: Like Dinah Shore.
(sangiag)
See the U.S.A. in your chevrolet
America is as<ing you to call.
(throwing kiss)

ce
I don't want to sing about a car.
10.

ec (cont'd.)
(dreamy)
Give me a Gershwin tune.

HILLARY
What's that about? A bike?

They have reached the top of the steps and CC freezes. The
elegant mezzanine restaurant is packed with well-heeled
PEOPLE having tea and the tables are attended by uniforned
WAITERS.

ce
(anxious)
What're we doing here?:

Hillary clamly starts walking toward a free table.

HILLARY
I want to buy you a soda
for walking me back.

CC hesitates, then goes after her, glancing around nervous-
ly at the people she passes, who are staring at her with
shocked disapproval.

ec
There's soda on the board-
walk:
HILLARY
It's better here.
ec
But people are looking at me:
HILLARY
So what?
Hillary sits down.
cc

So they'll probably kick
me out of a place like this:

HILLARY
They can't.

cC stares at her, then just as she is about to sit:
WAITER

Just a minute you two:
You can‘t sit there:

ce
(mortified hiss)
I told you:
1.

She remains standing as the WAITER rushes up. Hillary
stares at him with an unwavering gaze.

HILLARY
Yes, we can, My name's
Hillary Whitney, I'm staying
here with my parents and I want
a chocolate soda. What do you
want, CC?

CC hesitates, staring anxiously at the waiter, then:

ce
(quick)
The same.

The waiter looks at CC with distaste, glares back at
Hillary, who stares back firmly, then with an angry sniff
suddenly lifts his pad, writes in it, turns on his heel
and walks off. CC quickly sits down, impressed.

cc
How'd you do that?

HILLARY
(dismissive shrug)
Easy. My father's rich.
(excited)
Promise when you go home
you'll write to me in Boston?

ce
(puzzled)
Sure,.but how come you want
to write to me so much?

HILLARY
Are you crazy?: You just
happen to be the most fantastic
person I ever met in my entire
life:

cc
I am..?

HILLARY
O£ course you are! ‘You smoke,
you wear make-up, you even curse
in front of your mother:

ce
(delighted)
Well, now that you put it that
way, I guess I am pretty amazing.

HILLARY
When you started singing...
12.

HILLARY (cont'd.)
‘(singing loudly,
raunchy voice, hold=-
; ing imaginery breasts)
You gotta see Mama every night
or you can't see Mama at all.
You gotta treat Mama...

MOTHER
(soft, amazed V.0.)
Hillary? What are you doing?

Hillary spins around to see her MOTHER, a tall, slender
woman in her thirties with beautiful, patrician features,
dressed in a white linen suit and sunglasses, walk up to
her with a dried-out woman of the same age, AUNT VESTA.

HILLARY’
(excited)
Mom, Aunt Vesta: This is
cc! I got lost and she
showed me the way back after
she did her Mama number:

VESTA
(soft, horrified)
Her Mama number. ..?

As Hillary's mother looks at CC she breaks into a warm,
charming smile.

MOTHER
I'm sure it was wonderful.
Look at that amazing outfit
you have on. :
(to Hillary)

We were looking everywhere
for you: Did you forget
we were going with your
father to the golf club?

HILLARY
But CC and I are having a soda.

CC, who has been staring at Hillary's mother as if she is
a@ goddess, comes around and stands up awkwardly.

ce
Hey, forget it: If I don't
go back Leona'll start foam-
ing at the mouth anyway.

As Hillary gets up her mother takes her hand and smiles
at CC. Vesta is fumbling in her purse.
13.

MOTHER
Thank you for looking after
my girl.

As they turn away, Vesta suddenly shoves some bills into
cc's hand with distaste.

cc
(taken aback)
What's this for..?

VESTA
(disapproving)
It keeps people like you
honest.

As Vesta walks after Hillary and Hillary's mother, Hillary
suddenly looks back over her shoulder at CC.

HILLARY
(bright, excited)
Be sure to keep in touch,
cc, okay?

cc
Well, sure, we're friends
aren't we..? .

Hillary doesn't hear as she vanishes down the steps with
her mother and Vesta. CC looks after them with longing for
a moment, then looks down at the money in her hand. The
waiter arrives and she suddenly shoves the money into his
pocket.

WAITER
(taken aback)
What's this for..?

cc
(teugh, cocky)
It keeps people like you
honest, buddy.

As she walks off toward the stairs, her taps clicking
cheerfully on the marble floor, her step quickly turns

into a defiant, little walking dance which attracts the
stares of everyone she passes. When she reaches the top

of the stairs, all eyes upon her, she suddenly breaks into a
quick combination step, as if she is exiting @ stage, then
taps her way lightly down the marble stairs until she dis-
appears from sight.

INT. ENTRY OF EPISCOPAL CHURCH - BOSTON - RAINY DAY - 1959

Two years older, dressed in black and looking as if she
14.

has been crying, Hillary stands next to the closed street
door, reading a letter. As she reads, we hear:

ce

(v.0.)
Leona won't let me go to
Julliard, so I have to
keep taking dancing lessors
from Miss Jean Kayton, the
freaky fat vaudeville star.
Her studio's in the cellar,
which means you only graduate
when you're tall enough to
hit your hea on the ceiling.
What's a genius like me doing
in a place like this?; By
the way, I'm sorry your mother's
sick. Is she better?

At that moment, the door to the street is abruptly pulled
open. A handsome man in his forties, also dressed in black
and looking shattered, stands under an umbrella on the steps.
At the curb, we see a coffin being slipped into the back of
a hearse, which is surrounded by a group of MOURNERS under
umbrellas. Hillary stares at the vision with a stunned
frightened face, then care fully folds CC‘s letter and puts
it into her pocket, takes her father's hand and walks out
into the rain. ,

INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - 1962

It is decorated for a dance and packed with teenagers danc-
ing a slow dance to recorded rock and roll. Locking un-
happy, CC stands with a group of unattractive girls at the
pase of the stage near the refreshments table. Her clothes
are too tight fa her voluptuous body so make her look fat,
her curly hair is crushed to her head with clips and her
make-up is designed to exaggerate her worst features.

She clearly has no idea of what she looks like but sus~
pects it is not good. As she reads a letter, we hear:

HILLARY

(v.02)
I've definately decided
on Vassar. You asked what
I'm going to be wnen I grow
up. I have a feeling I'm go-
ing to be my father. He never
lets me out of his sight since
my mother died.
is.

During this a boy walks up to the group. The girls look
at him hopefully, including CC. ‘His eyes meet hers, she
smiles invitingly, he stares for a moment longer, then
turns and walks away. She sighs with despair as she goes
back to the letter.

HILLARY

(v.0.)
By the way, I really res-
pect your decision to de-
dicate your life to art in-
stead of boys. That kind of
sacrifice shows great charac-
ter.

EXT. VASSAR CAMPUS - SUNNY SPRING DAY - 1968

Hillary, now a stunningly beautiful woman, walks slowly
across the lawn toward a building in a crowd of STUDENTS,
carrying books and clumsily writing a letter. She has the
kind of fresh, intelligent face that will still be beautiful
in old age, bones that promise character and an innate
grace that expresses itself effortlessly.

HILLARY

(vV.0.)
It's not the same for me,
I don't have yur talent,
which is why I've decided
to stay in Boston and take
the job in my uncle's law
firm. Drawing up wills and
dissolving marriages is bor-
ing no matter where you do it
and my father would be desolé
(that's French for fucked up)
if I left. Will I ever see you
again? How is New York? I'm
sure by now you've taken it by
storm.

INT. MACY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - NEW YORK - DAY - 1971

The place is decorated for Christmas and packed with SHOPPERS.
A special display features an excercise bed ~- a double bed
mattress which vibrates and undulates simultaneously.

CC, wearing a negligee and writing a letter, is strapped to
the mattress, oblivious to the stares of the buying public.
Gone is the insecure teenager and in her place is a striking
woman with a lush body and a great mane of blinding red hair.
CC the adult knows what she looks like and makes the most of
it.

ce
(v.0.)
Forgive the writing
16.

cc (cont'd.)
(v.0.)

but I'm trying to do it
while making a special
guest appearance at Macy.'s.
I was just about to committ
suicide by taking an overdose
of vitamin A when your letter
arrived telling me I am a genius
and not to lose heart. I de-
cided to live even though I
have not had a single performing
job in eight months, I have been
turned down by every agent in
«town, I‘m broke and desperately
lonely during this festive season.
Lucky you.

 

The sound of a train station bleeds in.
INT. PENN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A DISCARDED TIMETABLE as many feet walk over it.
The date is February 11, 1972

cc
(v.0.)
' Tucked safely in the bosom
of your family.

As a very expensive pair of woman's boots walk over it.
CAMERA MOVES UP AND BACK AND FOLLOWS HILLARY as she makes
her way with the crowd toward the main terminal building.
She is struggling with a few pieces of expensive luggage
and has a crumpled Boston Globe jammed under her arm. She
is @ressed in conservative but stylish clothes - man's
cashmere coat, wool challis skirt, silk shirt, etc.

INT. PENN STATION ~ MAIN TERMINAL - NIGHT

Hillary quickly walks to a bank of pay phones, an anxious
look on her. face, takes a great pile of change from her .
purse, lights a cigarette hungrily, then feeds change into
the phone and dials a long distance number. The phone
rings, then:

HILLARY

(bright, tense)
Hi, Dad? It's me, Hillary.

(pause, anxious)
Well, no, I won't be joining
you ‘for dinner tonight, I'm...
I'm in New York...

(pause, desperate)
Well, I. don't know...I thought
17.

HILLARY (cont'd.)
maybe I'd check out some
job possibilities here and...
(pause, pleading)
Please, Dad, please don't be
upset, I've been trying to tell
you for months I wanted to go but
you wouldn't listen so I...
(pause, uneasy)
Dad..? Are you still there...?
(flat, firm)
Fuck you, Dad.

She hangs up, tosses her Boston Globe dramatically into

a nearby trashcan and resumes her journey to the street
with her luggage, anxiety replaced by an excited determina-
tion. .

INT. SEEDY PIANO BAR ~ MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Wearing a skin-tight thirties evening gown, a huge fake er-
mine boa and lots of rhinestone jewelry, CC sings GOOD MORN-
ING HEARTACHE to an indifferent crowd, accompanied on the
piano. At one table a drunken couple talk and laugh loudly,
at ancther a woman sobs next to a man who sits with his face
in his hands, at the bar businessmen are hustled by hookers,
etc. Although CC has a. desparate lock on her face, she

sings honestly and from the heart to her dismal audience.
When the song ends, she waits expectantly but nothing happens.
She smiles slightly and bows.

cc

Thank you, thank you:
You're too, too kind!

INT. PIANO BAR OFFICE - NIGHT

The mom is more like a dirty, little broom closet than
an office and a gay man of forty, HARRY, with a tired, ruined
face is counting money into a strong-box when CC walks in.

ec

(bright, strained)
So, Harry, did you catch
that set? Those people are
crazy about me:

(no response)
They're so crazy about me
they're spending money hand
over fist:

(no response; sweet)
So I was wondering, Harry,
could you lend me fifty bucks
until payday?
18.

HARRY
(counting money
No.

ce

(hysterical fit)
That's it: That's the end:
I can't take anymore: I mean,
what is this place, a piano bar
or a Nazi work camp?! I'm dying
of malnutrition from living on
dogfood, I sing my heart out for
peanuts and you can't part with
fifty fucking bucks you already
owe me?! Do you realize how lucky
you are to have me for two weeks?
When my run ends you could end
up with some bimbo who’walks on
her hands for a living: You...

Without looking up, he holds up a fifty dollar bill, and
she quickly walks over and takes it. -

cc
(grateful)
sare an angel, Harry, straight
from heaven. I£.your mother :
hadn't been such a bitch we might
have shared something important,
you know?

As he gives her a look, we hear:

HILLARY
(breathless excite-
ment)
cc..? CC Bloom..?

eC turns to see Hillary standing in the doorway. She looks
at her without recognition.

ee
Yeah?

Hillary steps into the room.

HILLARY
Oh, CC; I'm so thrilled:
I can't believe we're finally
in the same room together:
I've been dreaming of this
moment for so long:

cc stares at her, then frowns slightly.
219.

ce
Look, honey, I don't know
what you're after, but if
it's what I think it is,
you've got the wrong girl.

HILLARY
(taken aback)
What?
ce
You're not my type, com-
prenez-vous?
HILLARY

cc: Don't you recognize
me?: It's Hillary:

CC stares at her, then her eyes begin to widen.

ce
(soft)
Whitney...?

Hillary nods. CC stares at her, then slowly walks toward
her.

cc
(soft, amazed)
How could I recognize you?
I haven't seen you since
we were eleven...

She suddenly lets out a great shriek of excitement and Harry
slaps his hands over his ears in pain as the two women em-
brace.

“ ec

I don't believe this:

(to Harry)
Do you believe this, Harry?
We've been writing since we
were eleven:

(to Hillary)
What are you doing in
York?!

HILLARY

: (confused laugh)
I don't know,

(emotional)
I just walked out on my life
in Boston tonight. I felt
so suffocated I couldn't stand
it anymore so I just left.
. 20.

HILLARY (cont ‘d.)
My job, my apartment, my family...

ec
(cutting in, tense)
Your money too..?

HILLARY
(startled)
Well, I hadn't thought about
it, but yes, I guess my money
too.

With a heartbroken cry, CC puts her face in her hands.
EXT, SOHO STREET - NIGHT

The wind blows bits of newspaper around as CC and Hillary,
carrying Hillary's luggage, approach the lighted doorway

of a loft building. CC is now wearing a huge, second-

hand fur and English riding boots and Hillary is looking
around at the overturned trashcans, seedy bars and collapsed
DRUNKS uneasily.

HILLARY
(bright, strained)
I really appreciate the offer,
cc, put I'm sure I can find
a place of my own to live.

ec
In this neighborhood?: Never:

HILLARY
(soft)
Yes, well, I guess there's
always uptown.

ec
You're broke! And anyway, Leona‘’d
have a heart attack if I didn't
invite you to move in.

. HiuLaRyY
She lives in Miami. She'd
never know.

CC is opening the door with her key. A drunken WOMAN sits
on the step clutching a bottle in a brown paper bag.

ce
Hi, Marjorie. How's life
treating you?
21.

The drunk falls against the wall, her eyes shut,the bottle
still clutched in her hand. CC shoves some money in her
pocket.

cc
Cut down on the gasoline,
Marge, It's bad for the
complexion.

Cc quickly climbs over the drunk and enters the biilding.

HILLARY
(staring at drunk)
She could be dead.

ce
(holding door,
cheerful) ‘
Nah. I£ she was dead she
would have dropped the bottle.

Hillary looks at her with a strained smile, then gingerly
climbs over the drunk and enters the building.

BLACK SCREEN

We hear a door opening and then a light snaps on.
INT. .cC'S LOFT - NIGHT ,
Hillary and CC walk in and drop the luggage on the floor.

ce
(bright)
So? What do you think?

Hillary slowly looks around the room which, except for a
few rudimentary pieces of furniture and a storm of dis-
carded clothes, is bare and gives the impression it is in
a bombed-out building. A jerry-built kitchen stretches
along a wall beneath a row of large, dirty, uncurtained
windows looking out on the empty street. Hillary suddenly
bursts into tears.

ce
(offended)
Hey: So it's not Buck-
ingham Palace: It's home
to me:

HILLARY
(wiping away
tears, excited)
You don't understand: I'm
erying because I'm happy:
It just hit me I'm finally

HILLARY (cont'd.)

involved in real life, not
the sanitized version you
get on Beacon Hill:

(pacing room)
Do you realize for the first
time in my life I'm free?:
For the first time I'm doing
exactly what I want to do ra~
ther than what I‘ve been train-
ed to do?! I feel like scream~
ing and shouting free at last,
free at last, thank God Almighty
I'm free at last:

ccC stares at her shining face.

cc
(soft)
Are you like this all the
time..?

HILLARY
(puzzled)
No.

CC smiles sweetly as she kicks the door shut.

cc
Good. Then you can stay.

INT, COPY SHOP = MID-TOWN - DAY

It is packed with PEOPLE. CC and the Manager, a mean-
looking fat WOMAN in late middle-age, are behind the coun-
ter frantically helping customers.

ce
(exasperated)
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't
fit all that on one rubber
stamp.

MAN
But it has to be on one
acemp: Why can't you fit
it

cc
(acid)
Because you would either need
- a microscope to read the print
or we'd have to order a stamp
so huge it would take a hydrau-
lic lift to pick it up:

cc (cont 'd.)
(tossing order form
at him)
Think it over and come back
when you've made up your little
mind: Next:

A telephone rings as the man throws the form on the floor
and storms out. As the manager answers the phone, a little
MAN in a raincoat appears.

MAN
I want to use the color copier.

cc
(irritated)
Go away or I'll call the cops.

MAN .
I have a right to use it:

MANAGER
cc: Telephone:

ce
I have to call back.

I've told you a hundred times
already, it's against the law
to even have those pictures much
less copy them:

MANAGER
You can't call back.
ec
Why not?
MANAGER

It's your roommate, She's in
jail and needs you to bail her
out.

cc stares at her.
INT. HOLDING TANK - POLICE STATION = DAY

It is packed with scurilous-locking WOMEN ~ hookers,
thieves, fight victims, etc. In one corner, a GROUP

of antiewar types huddle anxiously together. While she
talks, Hillary walks amongst the unwashed handing out
leaflets featuring her smiling face beneath a headline
reading “VOTE DEMOCRATIC = HILLARY WHITNEY FOR CITY COUNCIL,
16TH DISTRICT.” Hillary's conservative clothes are gone
and she is now dressed in army surplus fatigues, leyers of
sweaters and scarves, etc. In spite of it all, she still
24.

looks as if she belongs on the mver of Vogue. The down-
trodden accept the leaflets with docile, blank faces.

HILLARY

(passionate, in-

spiring)
You've got to vote, you've
got to tell your friends
to vote. This city doesn't
just belong to Wall Street

to you too and

I promise once

I'm on the city council things

As the now exasperated-looking cop leads Hillary and cc
to the front desk Hillary practically assaults him.

HILLARY
Nobody read re my rights

Shut-up, lady.

HILLARY
I will not shut-up:

: She starts pulling.Hillary down the hall. Hillary yanks
her arm away but keeps walking, pulling a cigarette out
of her pocket.

(lighting up)
God, what an experience:
First my civil rights were
violated and then a hooker
threatened to stab me with
, a bobby pin if I didn't give

CC looks at her as if she is insane.

cc
What is with you?: First
you quit your low-paying job
with the ACLU to run for
some cockamamey political
office in a district full of
congenital idiots and killers,
and now you have to go to jail
too?

HILLARY
I didn't do it on purpose. .
I was on a run-of-the-mill
o~ . anti-war march when a few zea-
lots started throwing bottles
at the cops: Do you think I
like having tear gas bombs thrown
in my face?

Yes. I do.
She walks out. Hillary goes after her. 26.
*™ EXT, POLICE STATION - DAY _ ,

As they start down the steps:

HILLARY
Going back to work?

ce
I was fired.
HILLARY

I'm retiring the last of my
eredit cards today.

ce
I can hardly hold back my
i tears.

HILLARY
What do you say we send it
off in style?

oo Cc leoks at her with sudden interest.
cc
Lunch and a facial?

HILLARY
Lunch, a facial and Bendels.

cc
(delighted)
Now you're talking:

As they start off down the street arm in arm, Hillary
suddenly looks at her curiously.

HILLARY
Don't you care about any of
this stuff?

cc
What stuff?

HILLARY
What's going on in the world.
The injustices, the wrongs,
ro . the problems.

ec
Sure I do. We just have a
. Gifferent approach te things,
that's all. :
27.

HILLARY
What do you mean?

ec
I mean you want to change
the world.
(looks at her)
I want to rule it.

INT. -VW BUG - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING

Hillary is behind the wheel and driving like a maniac,
leaning on the horn, practically going up on curbs to pass
people, etc. We see campaign posters and leaflets covering
the back seat, CC is in the passenger seat, gripping the
dashboard, dressed in a rabbit costume complete with rubber
muzzle, teeth and plastic whiskers.

 

ce
After all I've done for you,
you're complaining?

HILLARY

No, I'm just saying you al-
ways take these jobs when I'm
in a rush to be somewhere.

(yelling out window)
What are you doing, asshole?
Taking your vacation at the
interesection?

She skids to a halt in front of a tenement building, just
missing a garbage truck.

ce
(sort, horrified)
You must have gotten your
license out of a cereal box.

HILLARY
Do you want me to wait?

cc turns to her and snaps the muzzle against her face.

ec
What do you think?

As she speaks, Hillary grabs a bunch of envelopes and leaf-
lets and starts stuffing.

HILLARY ,
Then you'd better step on
it. I'm speaking at a rent
strike raliy in an hour.
27A.

cc stares at her as if she is a rare species of bird,
then quickly jumps out of the car, slams the door
and runs into the building.

INT. TENEMENT ~ MORNING

CC walks past a couple of doors in the dark, seedy corri-
dor, the muzzle sitting on her head, checking apartment
numbers. She stops in front of a door and rings the bell,
then slips the muzzle on her face. Inside we hear a couple
of crashes, a number of locks being undone and the door is
finally pulled open by JOHN CHASE, an extremely attractive,
intense-looking man in his early thirties who looks as if
he just woke up from a sound sleep after a very late night.
He is barefoot and wearing hastily pulled on jeans and t-
shirt. She smiles brightly.

cc
Good morning: TI have a
birthday message for you
from your darling bunny
girl Barbara: .

JOHN
. (@azed, horrified)
My what..?

ce
’ I don't make the stuff .
up, pal. I just deliver it.
(singing)
Happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday darling bunny boy
. happy birthday to you.

Without a second's hesitation, she begins to sing “CRAZY
BE CALLS ME.“ John listens, transfixed by her lovely voice,
then when she finishes he leans against the wall.

JOHN
You have a great voice.

CC smiles flirtateously as she removes the bunny muzzle.

ec
Do you really think so?
(light laugh)
Of course I'm not the type
to believe flattery, but
some critics have even call-
ed me a genius.
28.
JOHN

(amused)
Oh, I see. You're a pro.

ce
(grand)
My last engagement was in
a divine little supper club
in mid-town called The Dew
Drop Inn.

JOHN
(taken aback)
The what?

cc
(quick)
Never mind.
(holding out hand,
flirtaeous smile)
cc Bloom.

JOHN
(shaking it)
John Chase. So, CC Bloom,
where are you appearing now?

ec
(evasive)
I'm in between club dates.
I'm at a turning point in
my career, you know? And
I have to be very, very selec-
tive.

There is an awkward pause.

. JOHN
Well. Nice meeting you, CC.

CC looks at him with a slightly desperate look on her face,
wanting to prolong the moment.

ce “
Yeah...nice meeting you...

She hesitates, then with a little, reluctant wave turns
and starts walking away, trying to think of some reason
to turn back. John is watching her with a thoughtful
expression on his face.

JOHN
(sudden)
Wait a minute.

cc
(turning, excited)
I'm free tonight and all weekend:
29.

He ignores her remark as he walks over to her.

She stares at

JOHN
Have you ever acted?

ce

No. . Why?

JOHN
I run a little repertory com-
pany and we need someone with
@ strong voice. Interested in
auditioning?

ce
(shrugging),
Well...I don't know...what 's
the name of the company?

JOHN :
The East Side Players.
hin.

cc
Are you serious? The company
that sends all those shows
to Broadway?

(he nods; astonished)
Jesus. And you still live in
a@ place like this?

(sudden, panicky)
Forget it. I'm just a singer,
you know? JI don't know the first
thing about...

JOHN
(impatient)
You don't have to. You're ob-
viously talented...

ce
(thrilled)
You think so0..?

JOHN
You've got great natural tim-
ing and you can learn the rest.
Anyway, it's just an audition.
All either one of us has to lose
is a little time,

him adoringly, falling in love.

ec
When?
39.
JOHN

Next Fraday at
3:00 sharp.

cc
(soft, thrilled)
You know, the second I saw
you in that doorway I had
a feeling we would...

At that moment, the street door opens and Hillary walks in.

HILLARY
If you want me to drive
you home, CC we have to
leave now:

cc turns to her with a radiant smile.

ce
John Chase, my roommate,
Hillary Whitney.

When Hillary's eyes meet John's it is electrifying for both.
They stare at each other, then Hillary quickly walks for-
ward and holds out her hand with an awkward smile.

HILLARY
Hello. Sorry to be s0
abrupt, but I'm running
late for an appointment.

They shake hands, transfixed by one another.

JOHN
An audition..?

HILLARY
An audition. .?
(sudden, laugh)
Oh, no! I'm not a performer.

JOHN
The way ,ou look...I just
assumed...

HILLARY
(handing him a leaflet)
I'm running for city council.

| JOHN
I'll vote for you.

HILLARY
Wrong district.
JOHN
My loss. 31.

ce
(sudden, shrill)
Isn't it time to get moving,
dear?!

Hillary quickly glances at her, ther looks back at John
as she starts edging out the door after CC,

HILLARY
, Goodbye, John, Nice meeting
you.
JOHN

Very nice meeting you.
The door bangs shut.
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

As CC and Hillary descend the stairs, Hillary glances at
her with excitement.

HILLARY .
He's very attractive, isn't
he?

ec:
(sullen)
I suppose, if you like
the type.
She flops into the car and pulls the door shut.
INT. CAR - DAY
As Hillary climbs in and starts the engine:
HILLARY
I wonder why that woman

calls him her darling bunny
boy. .

cc turns to look at her, their eyes lock for a moment,
then CC turns away.

HILLARY
(soft, intrigued)
Oh. I see,
Int. EAST SIDE THEATER - ONSTAGE - DAY

It is in an abandoned church on the lower east side.
32.

cc
is finishing up a reading from Streetcar Named Desire.
She is surprisingly good as Blanche DuBois except she
plays her as a girl from The Bronx. John sits watching
her in wonder.

ce
He'd stuck a revolver into
his mouth and fired: so that
the back of his head had been -
blown away! It was because on
the dance floor - unable to stop
myself - I'd suddenly said “I
know! I saw! You disgust me."
And then the searchlight which
had been turned on the world
was turned off again and never
for one moment since has there
been any light stronge than this
kitchen candle...

There is a pause, then she looks up anxiously and slowly
lowers the script. John stares at her.

ce,
So..?
* JOHN
(soft)
Blanche Dubois is from the
South. ce

(tough, belligerent)
Yeah? So? I'm from The Bronx:

INT. LOFT BATHROOM = DAY

Sunlight streams through dirty windows. In theix under-
wear, CC and Hillary are dying their hair. CC is rinsing
hers in the sink and Hillary is drying hers with a blow-
dryer.

ee
(defensive)
Well, no, it's not a big
part, I only have four lines,
« but each one is dense with
meaning.

HILLARY
John called me yesterday.

cc, who is drying her hair with a towel, @arts her a look
of surprise.

ec
Why?

HILLARY
For lunch, but I had to speak
to the chamber of commerce.
(pause, casual)
Is he still with the set de-
signer?

cc
(casual)
Nah. He dumped her for &
dancer in A Chorus Line.

HILLARY
How'd she taxe it?

ec .

(with relish)
Sui-i-cidal: He's absolutely
heartless when it comes to
women.

HILLARY
(soft, uneasy)
Really. :
CC drops the towel, shakes her hair out and looks at
Hillary expectantly. Her mane is now blonde.

cc
Wnat do you think?
33.

HILLARY
It's fabulous:
(patting hair,
excited)
What do you think of mine?

cc
It's the same color.

HILLARY
What?

cc turns her to face the mirror.

ce
You just spent the last two
hours dying your hair ex-
actly the same color.

INT. EAST SIDE THEATER - LOUNGE ~ DAY

CC sits on a broken=-down couch in the dusty room sipping
coffee and reading a script.

Through an open door-
way leading into the main part of the theater we hear a pi-
ano playing and see a play being rehearsed. CC suddenly
slams the script shut and walks off down a hall with @ set,
belligerent expression.on her face.

INT, HALLWAY - DAY

CC stops in the doorway of a small, cluttered office. John
is at the desk paying bills.

ce
I've been cast as a pri-
gon guard on death row.

JOHN
(looking up)
I know. I did the casting.

ce
I thought I'd have a bigger
part.

JOHN
Not yet.

ce

But this isn't me.

JOHN
Act like it is.
34.

~~ : She stares at him, he stares back, then she walks out of
the room with an exasperated, defeated sigh. He goes
back to his bills.

INT. SEEDY LAUNDROMAT - LATE NIGHT

The place is empty except for CC, who is stretched out on
a bench staring at the ceiling, and Hillary, who is re-
moving things from a dryer and folding then.

ce
Tell me the truth. I mean
really, really tell me the
truth.

HILLARY
Okay.

cc
Do you think I'm very tal-
ented or just moderately
talented? :

i HILLARY
, . (faint sigh)
I think you're very talented,
Cc. I've told you that at

, least eight million times.

 

, ce
. - I know, but maybe you're
just being nice. How do
I know you mean it and
‘ that you're not just being

nice?
(silence)
Do you mean it?
HILLARY
(exasperated)
Yes: I mean it!
ec
(quiet)
He thinks I'm very talented
too.
HILLARY

(folding, casual)
How is he? Still with the
erying waitress?

ce
No. She entered an Ashran
when he started seeing the
gymnast.
35.

ce (cont'd.)

(pause)
Did he ever call you again?

HILLARY
No. My schedule's so tight
I said I'd call him.
(sudden)
The girl who entered the Ashram,
was she religious?

cc
No.
(leoking at her)
E-motionally shattered.

HILLARY
_ BY him?
ce
Uh-huh.
(pause)
Are you going to do it?
HILLARY
What?
ce
Call him.
HILLARY

I don't know.

They sink back into their own thoughts as Hillary folds,
then CC turns to look at her.

ee
I'll never forget this
for as long as I live.

HILLARY
What?

cc
You doing my laundry for
me. I hate doing laundry
more than anything on earth
and this is the kindest thing
anyone has ever done for me,
(looking back at
ceiling, thoughtful)
A man would never do this for
you no matter how much he loved
you.
36.
INT. CC AND HILLARY'S LOFT - NIGHT

A seraggly, haphazardly decorated Christmas tree with a
few wrapped presents under it provides the only light.

The loft has been transformed by Hillary into @ place
where people live. Her sleeping area has prints on the
wall, lush plants, filled bookshelves, cluttered desk

over which hangs evidence of her political campaign, news-
paper clippings, posters, photographs, etc. CC and Hillary
are in their beds, falling asleep.

HILLARY/CC

(singing softly)
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
the Little Lord Jesus
Lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky
Looking down where he lay
The little lord Jesus
Asleep in the hay.

They both stare dreamily at the tree through half-closed
eyes.

HILLARY ,
How about Good King Wenceslaus?

cc
Not tonight, Hill.

HILLARY
Okay.
(shutting eyes)
Goea night, CC.

ce
(drifting off)
Goodnight, Hillary

The Christmas lights blink on and off in the dark as their
breathing deepens into sleep.

INT, RAPPAPORT'S DAIRY RESTAURANT - LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY

The place is packed with a lunch crowd. CC sits alone at
a window table eating and reading a script. As John
passes the window he knocks on it, then a moment later he
slips into the seat across from her.

JOHN
So. What do you think of
the new play? Brilliant,
isn't it?
37.

ce
(indifferent)
Yeah. Revolutionary. What
do I play? A piece of scenery?

JOHN
One of the two leads.

She stares at him, then shakes her head,

cc
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
possibly do that.

JOHN
(slight laugh)
What?

[a
It's out of the question.

He reaches across and takes her hands reassuringly.

JOHN
I promise you, CC. You
ean't fail.

ce
(startled)
Pail? Of course I can't
fail. I know that.

He drops her hands with irritation.

JOHN
Then what the hell is the
problem?

She leans toward him.

cc

(emotional,

frightened)
If I do that, everything
will change. Forever. I
know it. Right now I feel
like I'm remembering me hav-
ing this conversation with
you. I don't want things to
change that much. I don't want
to leave things behind. It's
lore ly.

John stares at her, then stands up.
38.

JOHN

(disgusted)
What a lot of self-in-
dulgent crap.

(teugh)
You know the saying better
lueky than good? You were
born with the kind of talent
that will always have some-
place to go. That's very lucky.
Don't ask me to feel sorry for
you for being lucky.

He turns and walks out of the restaurant. She watches
him go with an anxious expression on her face, then looks
down at the script as if it is going to attack her. She
finally takes a deep breath and as she opens it to read
‘she suddenly blesses herself, then throwg up her hand in
exasperation.

ce
(mutter)
What are you doing?:
You're a Jew:

She nervousiy flips through the pages, pausing on one
near the end. As she reads, she unconsciosly begins to
hum a tune under her breath. It turns into:

INT. EAST SIDE THEATER - ONSTAGE - NIGHT

The show is similar to The Rocky Horror Show - wildly made-
up and costumed, CC sings the final song, a show-stopper,
whieh includes the entire chorus. When the song ends, the
theater ‘suddenly goes completely dark, then the houselights
go up and the audience, composed primarily of downtown
types and a sprinkling of critics, goes crazy. The entire
company is assembled onstage, with CC at the center of the
line. As the applause continues undiminished, they bow
deeply, then as CC straightens up CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON
HER. The actors on eitherside of her gently prod her for-
ward so she is standing alone, just in front of the line,
and the applause turns into cheers and a standing ovation.
She suddenly breaks into a smile, her face lit with wild
excitement and triumph. CC is finally on her way.

MATCH SHOT
. 39.
INT. EAST SIDE THEATER - BACKSTAGE ~ NIGHT

A large, noisy party is underway. CLOSE ON CC. Still in
costume and make-up, she is trying to appear happy in spite
of the fact that she is utterly miserable.

ce
(stiff smile)
Happy? I'm out of my mine
with happiness: This is
the most wonderful night of
my life:

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the party and Hillary, who
seems to be oblivious to CC's state.

HILLARY
(warm, excited)
When you first appeared I
actually cried. I couldn't .
help it. You were like a
stranger up there, a...

John suddenly appears with a bottle of champagne.

JOHN
(cutting in, happy)
Refills anyone? :

Hillary quickly turns and smiles brilliantly at him.

HILLARY
(holding out glass)
You're a genius: Where did
you find more champagne?

cc
{acid)
In the office where he put
the fifteen cases he bought
this afternoon. They taught
him how to do it at Yale.

John and Hillary are only aware of each other.

JOHN
(to Hillary)
You know, it's the strangest
thing, but I can't shake the
feeling that I know you well.

: HILLARY
I know, I feel the same way
about you. I wonder why?
40.

ec
That's obvious: You must
have met in a former life:
(bitter laugh)
I'm sure it has nothing to
do with the fact that [ talk
about both of you incessantly.

John and Hillary look at her with puzzled frowns, then John
turns back to Hillary.

JOHN
How's the campaign going?

HILLARY
(excited)
Well, it's amazing. I was
way behind but the latest
poll shows me running even!
I have a good chance of
winning:

JOHN

(intense)
I really respect what you're
doing, you know? It makes
all this, the theater, art,
seem trivial somehow. Having
a deep social committment
makes...

CC suddenly shoves her glass in front of his face.

ce
(hard)

Me thirsty: More cham-
pagne, please.

He looks. at her as if she is a wild animal as he refills
her glass. At that moment, .

an ACTOR appears, wearing his coat and carry-
ing a great stack of newspapers.

ACTOR *
Okay, everybody, this is it:

As he tosses the papers on a chair ., PEOPLE rip them up,
opening to the reviews, including CC and John, everything
else temporarily forgotten. Several people crush around

each paper, reading avidly over one another's shoulders,

etc. An actors' head snaps up.

ACTOR
The Voice said it's the
musical of the decade:
41.

cc
(reading)
We got a rave from the News:

John looks up from the New York Times.

JOHN
John Simon said it was
fresh.
(scattered laughter)
He also made special men-
tion of CC Bloom's perfor-
mance, which he called promis-

ing.
(John lifts his
glass)
To a great playwright and
a@ great company:

Cheers, everyone drinks.

. ACTOR
To a long run:

More cheers and drinking.

ce
And to a great theater
director:

As she turns to drink to John her face falls. He is
leading Hillary away from the others, engaged in inti-
mate conversation. CC looks completely heartbroken as
she downs her champagne in one desperate swallow.

EXT. CC AND HILLARY'S LOFT - DAWN

A squad car cruises along the deserted street and pulls
to a halt in front of the loft. The door opens and CC
stumbles out dressed in the same clothes, but now soaking
wet and carrying her shoes, She has sodden confetti and
streamers in her hair, which is matted and dripping, her
stockings are shredded and her make-up is smeared. She
is carrying her coat.

ce
(shrill)
I don't have to sleep
anything off and I'm
telling you for the last
time I wasn't the ring-
leader:

fhe slams the police car deor shut and stumbles into the
oft.
42.
INT. LOFT - DAWN -

Hillary is curled up in a chair near the window, wrapped
in a blanket, drinking coffee and lost in her own, very
happy thoughts as we hear a few crashes in the hallway.
The locks on the door are thrown and CC walks in. Hillary
sits up in shock.
BILLARY
My God: What happened to
you?:

cc heads for her sleeping area without looking at Hillary.

ec
(flat)
Some people and I went
‘for a swim in the Central
Park Boating Pond.

Hillary hesitates, then gets up, wraps the bianket around
herself and follows cc.

INT. CC'S SLEEPING AREA - DAWN

CC is getting out of her wet clothes and into a robe when
Hillary walks in.

HILLARY
(excited)
Don't you want to know what
happened to me?

CC gives her a quick glance, then turns away as she starts
removing her smeared make-up.
cc
(flat)
Wnat happened to you?
Hillary sinks down onto her bed.
HILLARY
Everything. I just spent
the most wonderful night of
my life.
CC keeps her face turned away.

With John?

Hillary leans back and shuts her eyes.

(dreamy)

With John. oh, CC, it was
so incredibly romantic. We
got & room at the Plaza, had
@ magnum of champagne sent up
«He's an incredible lover,

we didn't sleep all...

ce
(sudden, harsh)
Hand me that brash, will you?

Hillary sits up, finds the brush on the bedside table and
hands it to CC. CC quickly starts brushing her hair, her
back carefully turned to Hillary.

cc
{sudden, light)
So did the two of you fail
in love?

HILLARY
I don't know...we just met
really... °
(soft, happy)
We will.

cc is now brushing her hair very, very hard.

HILLARY
Oh, by the way, my father's
got some bug and I have to
go to Boston for a couple of
days. Will you water my plants
while I'm gone?

CC hesitates in her brushing, her back turned, then she
turns to look at Hillary, in torment. She finally sinks
down into a chair with a sigh, pulling confetti out of
her hair dejectedly.

ec
Oh, sure. We're friends,
aren't we,.?

INT. LOFT - MORNING

Wearing a robe and dark glasses, CC waters Hillary's lush
plants.

INT. RAPPAPORT'S DAIRY RESTAURANT - DAY

CC and John are having lunch in the crowded restaurant.

ce
. I'm telling you, thi
are changin ¥ For ne? “Some-
body asked for my autograph:
44,

JOHN
You were recognized by
someone in the street?:

cc
Well, no, by the janitor
who works in the theater
but, believe me, he's a
very picky guy.

John'leoks away. They eat in silence for a moment, then:

JOHN
Any word?

ce
About what?

He stares at her. She looks oat the window.

cc
(£lat)
Her father took a turn for
the worse. She has to stay
in Boston Longer than ex-
pected.

INT. LOFT - MORNING

Wearing a robe and dark glasses, CC waters Hillary's plants.
They look much less lush. She finds a couple of dead ors
and tosses them into the trash.

INT, BEACON HILL HOUSE ~ NIGHT

Tne silent house is beautifully decorated with antiques,
Morris paper, aubusson carpets, etc. While she avidly reads
a letter, Hillary climbs the sta irs to the second floor
carrying a dinner tray, CAMERA FOLLOWING.

cc
(v.0.)
I'm sorry you had to drop
out of the city council race,
bat don't lose heart. Your
father will be better soon
and you can run again.

Hillary opens a bedroom door and enters.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
It is dimly lit. She puts down the tray, glances anxiously

at the bed where we see a shadowy figure asleep under the
covers, then sinks into a chair and goes back to the letter.
45.

ec
(v.0.)
Did I tell you? There's
talk of taking the show
to Broadway: I can't be-
lieve it: All my dreams
are coming true:

Hillary looks up with a sad, lost face.
INT, ‘THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

We can hear the audience out front as the orchestra plays
the overture. CC emerges from her cubbyhole dressing room
and starts walking toward the wings. John appears behind her.

_JORN
Where the hell were you
all day yesterday?

He walks with her.

cc
Long Island. — Wny?

JOHN
I called you about twenty times.

ce
Oh, yeah? How come?

He stares at her, then laughs slightly in surprise and
embarrassment.

JOHN
I guess I missed you.
(they stare at
: each other)
Want to have dinner again
after the show?

ec
(soft, thrilled) .
Yeah. Sure.

As she starts to walk away:

JOHN
By the way, any news?

ec
(flat, over
shoulder)
The funeral was yesterday.
She has to stay a while
longer to settle the estate
with her father's lawyer.
46.
INT. CC'S LOFT - MORNING

Wearing @ robe and dark glasses, she fills a kettle with
water and walks over to Hillary's plants. They are dead,

ec
(sad sigh)
Suicide.

She puts the kettle down and climbs back into bed where
she resumes reading a letter.

HILLARY

(v.0.) .
Michael wasn't just my
father's lawyer, he was the
son my father never had and
in my father's final days it
gave him great joy to see us
together. The ceremoney was
civil and our wedding recep-
tion small, but it was lovely.
The only flaw was your absence,
but I understand the show must
go on. By the way, how's John?
Do you see much of him socially?

INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAWN

First light filters in through the open windows along with
the occasional metallic crash from garbage being collected.
A fan turns overhead and John is under a sheet, fast asleep,
his arms around CC, who is wide awake and staring into space.
She finally turns to him.

cc
dohn...?

JOHN
Mmmm...

ec

Last night. When we were
making love. Did you say you
loved me?

Pause. John's eyes open.

JOHN
What?

ce
I thought I heard you say
you loved me. Did you?

JOHN
Yes,

cc
Is that usual?
-46A,

JOHN
What do you mean?

ec
Do you say it to everyone?
Is it part of your routine?

JOHN
I don't have a routine and
I haven't said it to anyone
in ten years.

ce
(amazed)
Is that true?

JOHN
(offended)
I may be a womanizer, CC,
I'm not a liar.

She stares at him,then slowly begins to smile.

cc
(warm, happy)
Oh, good, because I just
had the most wonderful idea.

. JOHN
(warm, happy)
Oh, yeah? What's that?

INT. NEW YORK CITY HALL - INDIAN SUMMER DAY

CC, looking ecstatic, is standing in front of a JUDGE,
wearing @ thirties yachting suit and clutching a small
bouquet. John, looking panicky, stands next to her dressed
in a summer suit and tie. They are flanked by TWO WITNESSES
they dragged in off the street.

JUIGE
By the power vested in me
by the State of New York
I now pronounce you man and
wife.

cc and John slowly turn to look at each other, then CC
suddenly slaps him hard in the face,

JCHN
What the hell did you do
that for?:

ec
(in tears)
Because this is the happiest
manent of my entire life and
I never want you to forget it!
 

47.
INT. BOSTON SHUTTLE DEPARTURE LOUNGE - LA GUARDIA AIRPORT -
NIGHT - THE PRESENT

It is empty except for a few trapped BUSINESSMEN asleep

in chairs. Wrapped in her fur coat, CC stands at the
window gazing out at the airfield, which is shrouded by

a deep blanket of snow. The snow is still falling heavily.
She turns and walks past the chairs up to the desk where

a lone ATTENDANT is reading.

. cc
(desperate)
Any change?
(reading, shaking
head)
Absolutely nothing's tak-
ing off, not even private
planes:

ATTENDANT
(bored, reading)
That's right.

She sighs with exasperation and despair, then starts back
to the window. As she passes one of the sleeping business—
men, she notices the headline at the top of & newspaper
section which is spread over his face. It reads "GERSHWIN
IN BLOOM = CC triumphs in Carnegie Hall." She snatches

up the paper and starts reading the review. He moans and
she pats his shoulder comfortingly, he smiles, then she
unceremoniously drops the paper back over his face and re-
turns to her post by the window. She stares back out at
the snow with an anxious face, her forehead pressed against
the glass. CAMERA MOVES IN ON CC'S FACE.

EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

CLOSE ON HILLARY'S FACE AT EXACTLY THE SAME ANGLE. She is
staring up at something with a strange intensity, complete
ly lost in her own thoughts. CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK to
take in the heavy traffic, the CROWDS and finally an enor-
mous billboard showing CC as her character in the show from
the East Side Theater, which has moved to Broadway, It

is SRO. People shove past her, knocking her about a bit, ~
but she is oblivious to everything but the billboard and
her thoughts. She is dressed very conservatively. Her
husband, MICHAEL HAMILTON, a handsome man in his early
thirties, also very conservatively dressed, is standing
next to a taxi with the door open.

MICHAEL
Hillary:
(no response)
Hillary, wake up: I've got
a taxi:
48.
She comes to with a jolt.

HILLARY
Sorry, Michael:

She quickly climbs into the cab and he climbs in after her.
As it pulls away from the curb, we see that the license
plate has 1974 stickers.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TAXI as it cruises through traffic and
finally pulls to a halt in front of an old, elegant build-
ing. Hillary and Michael climb out of the cab and enter
the building. She takes in her surroundings with a tense,
guarded lock on her face.

INT. CC AND JOHN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

The place has clearly been put together by a decorator

and although tasteful it has a sterile quality to it.
Everything is overdone, expensive and new. Wearing a

very trendy designer outfit, CC is attempting to beat back
a violently lunging, very large, great dane puppy with a
newspaper as she, Michael and Hillary edge their way toward
the living room.

HILLARY
(tense, bright)
I'm so happy to finally
see you: :

ec .
(fierce) :
Down, Arthur, down:
(tense, bright)
I know! It's been ages:
‘ (pleading to dog)
Sit, Arthur, please sit
honey dog, sit for CC...
(to Michael)
It's so exciting to finally
meet you, Michael.
(swinging at
dog, shrieking)
Sit you brain-damaged bag
of bones or I'll have you
gassed:

As the living room door slams shut behind them Arthur hits
it with a shuddering crash.

INT. LIVING ROOM ~ DAY

CC spins around with a brilliant smile on her face.
49.

cc
Welcome a chez nous:

Michael has walked over to the windows ‘overlooking the
park as he takes off his coat.

MICHAEL
What a view of the city.
Spectacular.

cc

(bragging)
Ours is the only apartment
with that view from every

« window. aturally, we pay

through the nose, but it's
worth every penny.

(dramatic)
I couldn't bear that downtown
squalor another minute.

Hillary is looking at her with narrowed eyes, but before

she can speak John darts into the room and quickly slams
the door shut behind him. There is another shuddering crash
as the dog's body hits the wood. Hillary turns toward him
with excitement.

Jonn: = ¥

John quickly turns and his face lights up with pleasure
as he walks over to her. CC is watching them like a hawk.

JOHN
Hillary. My God.
(studying her)
I haven't seen you since
the night the play opened, have I..?

As the memories flood back, Hillary blushes.

HILLARY"
(flustered smile)
No. It's been a long time.

JOHN
(warm)
You haven't changed. Still
as beautiful as ever.

As they move to embrace, CC suddenly steps between them,

grabs John's arm and yanks him over to Michael, leaving
Hillary off balance.
50.

ce
John! You haven't met
Michael yet: Michael
Hamilton, John Chase.

As the two men shake hands, CC darts a worried lock at

Hillary whose
they stare at
sweetly.

Hillary looks

eyes are already on CC. For a split-second
each other with mistrust, then CC smiles

ec
So what do you think of
the place, Hill? Not
exactly the old loft on
Green Street, is it?

around the room cooly.

HILLARY
No, it's not. It's all
BOwee
(sweet smile)
as.

INT, TAXI - NIGHT

Hillary, Michael, CC and John are dressed for a night on

the town,

"HILLARY
(irritated)
No. I don't miss politics
at all. Why would I?

ec
(insistant)
Because it meant so much
to you, that's why.

MICHAEL

It's a little hard to have
a@ corporate lawyer and a
liberal politician in the
game household.

(pleasant laugh)
Someone has to do the enter-
taining.

Hillary quickly looks at John.

HILLARY
(strained, bright)
What have you been doing, John?
51.

JOHN
The usual. Mounting new
productions and sending them
on to Broadway. The company's
had a great year.

HILLARY
(intense, admiring)
- If I were in the theater

I'd want to be like you:
You have an artistic inte-
grity that seems to be lack-
ing in... -

(darting a look at

cc)
»eein Bo many others.

cc hasn't missed this. She slowly -turns to her with a
brittle smile.

ec
So tell me, dear, just. what
do you do with yourself all
day now that you're a house-
wife?

Hillary turns to her with cold eyes.

HILLARY
I beg your pardon?

cc
I'd go crazy doing nething:
(confiding to
Michael)
But then I've always been
a very energetic person.
(to Hillary)
Don't you get bored sitt-
ing around the house all day?

HILLARY
(sharp)
No, because I don't sit
around the house all day.
I‘m an extremely busy person.

The taxi has pulled to a halt in front of Twenty-One.
Before the doorman can reach them, Hillary slams the taxi-
door open and steps out, her lips a thin line.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE TWENTY-OSE - NIGHT

As they approach and enter the restaurant:
52.

ce
Doing what?

HILLARY
I beg your parden?

cc
How do you keep busy?
Doing what? .

JOHN
(tense laugh)
What is this, CC? The
Spanish Inquisition?

co
(defensive)
We haven't seen each other
for awhile. I just want
to know how she spends her
time. Is that a crime?

He gives her a warning look and she looks away with wounded

innocence.

INT, TWENTY-ONE - NIGHT

As they enter

Hillary darts

and check their coats:

HILLARY
(clipped)

I spend it working on var-
ious charities, I'm on the
Board of the Junior League,
The Stately Homes Preserva-
tion Society and I'm a docent
at the art musuem.

MICHAEL
(helpful)
Don't forget your horticul-
ture classes.

him an irritated look.

cc
(soft)
Horticulture classes..?

HILLARY
(sharp)
You may not be aware of it,
but gardening happens to be
an art:
. 53.
cc stares at her, then shrugs slightly.

cc
Hey. Who's criticizing.
The important thing is
you're happy, right?

Hillary takes Michael's arm.

HILLARY
Iam: I am very, very, very
happy:

At that moment, the HEAD WAITER rushes up to CC and John.

HEAD WAITER
(fawning)
Mr. Chase, Miss Bloom:
We've got your favorite
table ready for you:

As the Head Waiter leads them inside Hillary smiles at no
one, clutching Michael's am.

HILLARY
Mery happy:

“INT. CC'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Wearing casual clothes, CC and Hillary sit across from one
another with grim faces playing cards. They silently snap
up ecards and slap them down.

HILLARY
(slamming down
hand)
Gin:
She counts CC's points, then while CC rapidly shuffles
the cards, Hillary adds them on a pad.
ec
Who's winning?
. HILLARY
Tt am:
¢¢ starts dealing so hard and fast you can barely see the
cards. We hear the front door open and close.

JOHN
(v.02)
Anybody home?

cc
(clipped)
In here: , .
54.

Without a word to each other, they pick up their cards
and start arranging them with sharp snaps. John appears
in the doorway and stops with surprise.

JOHN
You're still playing cards?:

They start playing.

ce
Yes.

She rapidly rearranges her cards and discards.

JOHN
You were playing when I
left this morning:
(silence)
Want to stop and have a
late lunch?

ce
Idon't. Hillary?

+ HILLARY
No, thanks.

He watches them for a moment. They play in a grim, deter-
mined silence, as if engaged in a life and death battle.

ce

' (triumphant shriek)
Gin:

As she slams down her cards, he walks out.

INT. HENRI BENDEL'S - DAY

cc and Hillary walk through the ground floor of the crowd-
ed department store glancing at things as they talk.

ec
(using lip-
stick tester)
This is a great color on
me, isn't it?

Hillary is checking nail polish colors.

HILLARY
I guess.
ee ~
(snapping)

Well, is it or isn't it?

Hillary slams the nail polish down a Little too hard,
55.

HILLARY
No, it's not. It makes
you look like @ corpse. Is
that specific enough for you?

They walk on in silence for a moment, trying to put &
damper on their tempers. Hillary picks up @ hat and
tries it on.

cc
(sudden, desper-
ate)
I've got a great idea! Let's
get a facial:

HILLARY
(putting hat back)
Ican't. Michael's meeting
ends in an hour and we have
to leave for the airport.

cc suddenly picks up a baby's snowsuit made to look like
a teddy bear.

ec
Oh, Hill, look: Isn't this
divine?

HILLARY
Very sweet.
(unguarded)
I can't wait to have a baby.

ce
(emotional)
Are you doing it soon?

HILLARY
(nappy nod)
Absolutely. Having children
is the most important thing
to me. I'd feel incomplete
without them.

cc
I know what you mean.

HILLARY
(surprised)
You do?

cc
(defensive)
Sure, I do. Way wouldn't I?
56.

HILLARY
(superior)
I just.didn't think someone
like you would care about
children. You're 80 obsessed
with your career and ali.

ce
(sharp)
I am not obsessed and just
because I work doesn't mean
that “someone like me" doesn't
want kids:

HILLARY
(sharper)
Wanting then and caring for
them properly are two differ-
ent things. Having children *
is a full time job.

cc
(hard)
For some people:

HILLARY
(harder) :
Yes. The ones who take the
responsibility seriously and
don't just have children to
gratify their overweaning egos:

cc
(exploding)
What the hell is going on here?:

People turn to look at then.

HILLARY
(furious hiss)
Will you please lower your
voice?:

cc
No, I won't: I want to know
what's eating you: You've been
a total bitch ever since you
arrived in New York:

HILUARY
(furious)
I could say the same about you!

ce
(superior)
I've simply been reacting to you:
57.

HILLARY
(sudden, cold)

Oh, for God's sake, CC,
don't you get it? We have
nothing in common anymore.
It happens to the best of
friends and it's happened
to us. We've grown apart
and it's time to accept it.

ec
You're wrong. We haven't
grown apart. You've fallen

apart.
HILLARY
(icey)
I don't think I want to
pursue this.
(turning, heading
for exit)

S50 long, CC. Take care.

ec

(sudden, loud)
Oh, no, you don't, you
stuck-up little witch:
You're not getting off
that easy:

(going after

her angry)
When your father died he
took the best of you with
him, my old friend:

(grabbing her arm,

tarning her)
You tried to be an interest-
ing person for a while, but
you couldn't take the heat:
At the first sign of trouble,
you caved in, reverted back to
type! You're nothing but
a tight-assed, small-minded
little snob these days:

HILLARY
(low, vicious) .
How would a pretentious little
climber like you know that?

ec
(harsh)
Experience! And I know what's
eathing you too: Plain, old-
fashioned jealousy:
58.

HILLARY
(contemptuous)
Jealousy? Of what? Your raw

ambition? Your new money?
Your marriage of convenience?

ec
(low, mortally
wounded)
My what?

HILLARY
(furious)

Every time John looks at me
you come apart at the seams:
What's the problem? Are you
afraid he doesn't love you?
Arve you afraid you got him by
default?

cc stares at her.

ce

(low, even)
Maybe I am, but at least I
belong to myself, which is
more than I can say for you.
rt'm doing what I want to do,
remember? Free at last, free
at last? I'm living the life
you wanted to live but didn't
have the courage for, so don't
tell me you're not jealous. You're
s0 jealous you can hardly breathe.

CC suddenly turns and walks out. As she vanishes inte
the crowd on the street, Hillary becomes aware of people
staring at her. She casually pretends to examine some

stockings, but as she picks them up her hand is shaking.
INT. PLANE - SUNSET

Hillary and Michael sit side by side as the plane levels
off after take-off. He is working on a file and she is
calmly reading a magazine. When the seat belt light snaps
off she calmly undoes her belt and gets up.

HILLARY
I'll be right back.

He nods without looking up from the file. She walks off
down the aisle toward the bathroom.

INT. PLANE BATHROOM ~ SUNSET

Hillary walks in, pulls the door shut and locks it, then
suddenly doubles over. as she is swept by great wracking
sobs.

INT. CC AND JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

The light is almost gone. They sit on the couch looking
cut the windows at the park, the dog stretched out asleep
on their laps. John has his arms around CC and it is ob-
vious she has been crying for a long time. Pause, then:

ec
(sudden)
If she hadn't gone back
to Boston, would you have
ended up with her instead
of me?

JOHN
Would you believe me if I
said no?

cc
(soft)
No.

JOHN :
Then why bother asking the
question.

Pause,

ec
(soft)
What will I do without a
best friend..?

JOHN
{comforting hug)
You have me.

She looks at him levingly, then looks back out at the park.
cc °
(low)
It's not the same.

They sit silently, holding each other, as the last light
fades.

EXT, BEACON HILL STREET - BOSTON - DAY

A NEWSPAPER BOY on a bike moves along the tree-shaded
street tossing papers onto the front steps of perfectly
restored and meticulously maintained 18th century town-
houses. CAMERA STAYS ON ONE AS THE PAPER LANDS. A moment
passes, the door opens and Hillary comes out. In spite of
the fact that her face is pale and drawn with unhappiness,

. she is still beautiful. She picks up the paper and goes

back inside,
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

It is furnished almost exactly as it was when it belonged
to her father. Listlessly reading the headlines, Hillary
wanders down the hall to the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Dressed for work, Michael is at the table finishing up
breakfast. Hillary walks in and sits down, still reading
the paper, then as Michael gets up and starts gathering
his things together to leave: :

HILLARY
(reading, dull)
Coming home for dinner
tonight?

MICHAEL
(distant)
I doubt it. I'm swamped
with work,
(forced interest)
Wnat are you doing today? .

HILLARY
(reading, dull)
I have another appointment

at the infertility clinic
and I have to buy a wrench.

He stares at her.

MICHAEL
A wrench? Why?

She looks at him.

HILLARY
We don't have one.

He stares at her, gives her a light kiss on the cheek and
walks out. She goes back to the paper.

CLOSE ON TELEVISION SCREEN
61.

On screen, a few depressed-looking PEOPLE sit at tables

in a seedy nightclub as a ruined-looking EMCEE with very
large, white caps introduces the next act. There is a drum
roll, the curtains part and CC emerges to applause and whis-
tles from a larger audience we cannot see. As she goes into
a routine which is a witty take-off on her days as a
cabaret singer at the Dew Drop Inn, CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BAG
and we realize we are in Hillary's bedroom. She is sitting
on the floor in front of the t.v. watching CC with longing.
A moment passes, then we hear:

MICHAEL
(calling v.0.)
Hillary?:

She turns the sound down guiltily and rushes out of the room.
INT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

She leans over the bannister to see Michael looking up at
her from the first floor.

MICHAEL
(amazed)
Are you watching television?

HILLARY
No, of course not. I was.
just in the bathroom.

MICHAEL
Our guests are getting ready
to leave.

I'll be right down.
As he walks away, she rushes back into the bedroom.
INT. HILLARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She rushes to the t.v. and turns the sound up slightly,
but CC's performance is over. As the end credits roll and
applause continues, CC mills around the stage of Saturday ~
Night Live with other members of the cast. Hillary stares
at her with hungry longing, then reaches out and gentiy
touches her on-screen figure with her finger tip. It
vanishes and is replaced by a commercial.

INT. MICHAEL'S STUDY - DAY

Michael is stretched out cn the couch watching the tennis
matches at Wimbledon when Hillary appears in the doorway.

HILLARY
It's time.

Michael gets up with an exasperated sigh and backs out
of the room, eyes on the t.v.

INT. HILLARY AND MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY

They try to make love with as much enthusiasm as two pieces
of wood. Michael falls away from her.

MICHAEL
Iocan't. I'm sorry, but
I just can't.

They both stare at the ceiling for a moment.

MICHAEL
Mind if I go back to
Wimbledon?

She shakes her head ‘no.' He is out of bed, into a robe
and out the door like a shot. She remains in bed, staring
at the ceiling.

CLOSE ON A PORTRAIT OF CC in the Sunday New York Times
Magazine section for June, 1976. It is part of an inter-
view. The magazine section is strewn on top of a pile of
Sunday papers, a straw hat, a cluster of wild flowers,

small overnight bag complete with umbrella, tennis racket
and shoes - the accoutrements of a weekend in the country.
All this is tossed onto the seat of a moving car. PULL BACK.

A limo drives along the road, which is lined with large,
garish apartment complexes, It pulls to a halt in front
of one of the biggest and most vulgar.

EXT, APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

The DRIVER jumps out,, runs around to the passenger side

and pulls the rear door open. There is the sound of a
struggle, curses, barking, then Arthur, now fully grown,
leaps from the car yanking CC out after him. She is wear-
ing dark glasses,a very extreme Fendi leather suit with
enormous padded shoulders, studs and an extremely tight

the dog while CC regains her balance. She lifts her glasses
and looks at the building with horror , then replaces them.

cc
I'll be back.

Do you want the dog?

ce
Do I want small pox?

She stumbles up the steps and passes through the main
entrance of the building into the courtyard. Her skirt is

so narrow at the knees she is forced to take very tiny
steps.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

It is vast and dominated by a large swimming pool. It is
packed with OLD PEOPLE sitting on beach chairs, fully
dressed and shielded from the sun by hats and umbrellas,
playing games. CC stumbles along between the tables, peer-
ing around as if she is looking for someone.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY - ANOTH:R ANGLE

FOUR WOMEN are sitting around a table under an umbrella
playing backgammon. One of them is Leona, who is fatter
and more horribly dressed than ever. CC appears behind
her, stumbling along through the maze of tables. While
Leona shakes the dice, the woman next to her catches sight
of cc.
OTHER WOMAN
Oh, my God, will you look
at that slut:

Leona glances behind her, suddenly stops shaking the dice,
leans back in her seat and starts screaming in short fran-
tic bursts. The other women look at her with alarm.

WOMEN
What's wrong?: Leona:
Is it your heart, your
bunions? What hurts? Leona:
Why are you screaming? What
is it?!

Leona struggles to her feet and throws her arms out drama-
tically.

LEONA
(shrieking)
It's my daughter the Broad-
way star!

She starts running toward CC, which is not an easy task
for a woman her size, arms thrown out and still screaming.
CC suddenly freezes and looks as if she is about to turn
and run in the opposite direction, but Leona reaches her
before she can move and throws her arms around CC.

LEONA
(hysterical)
I can't believe it's you!
I can't believe you're
here: It's like a gift from
God: A dream come true:
65.
CC gently struggles out of her death grip.

cc
I just saw you a month ago
in New York, Leona.
LEONA
(somber)
At my age a month means a
lot. It could be all I have.
(excited)
Is he with you?

cc
Who?

LEONA
Who?, Who else: The man of
my dreams, that handsome hus-
band of yours, adorable John:
Where is he?

cc
I left hin.

Leona stares at her in shock, then shakes her head in des- .
pair.

. LEONA
I don't believe it. Af-
ter only three years..
(sad sigh)
Why'd you walk, sweetie?
Was it another woman. .?

CC looks away, fighting back tears, obviously very upset.

ce
No, it's more complicated
than that..
LEONA
(kind)

Teil me, honey, get it off
your chest. Did he smack
you around?

cc

No!

(leoking away,

upset)
Something just died between
us, that's all...he used to
care about what happened to
me and..I don't know. he just
stopped paying attention to me.

 
66.

Leona stares at her, then turns and starts waddling back
to the table, laughing softly to herself. CC goes after
her.

ec
(disturbed)
Why are you laughing, Leona?

LEONA
Never mind. I'11 get my
purse and we'll go upstairs
to the apartment.

ce
(frantic)
Tell me why you're laughing:
Wny did you laugh when I said
that?:

Leona turns to look at her with a sigh.

LEONA
Honey, why do you think
I'm living in Florida?

cc
You like the sun.

LEONA

I don't give a shit about
the sun. I'm here because
it's peaceful.

(kind)
You want too much attention,
cC. You want so much atten-
tion all the time from every-
body that you wear people out.
You wore me and your father out
by the time you were fifteen.
I love you, but sometimes I just
can't pay any more attention to
you, do you know what I mean? I
want to, but I just can't do it.

(deep sigh)
If I were you I wouldn't leave
anybody for not paying attention
to you because sooner or later
you'll have to leave everybody.

cc stands staring after Leona with a frightened expression
on her face as Leona walks back to the table.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

A taxi pulls up to the curb in front of CC's building and
she jumps out, wearing the same clothes and accompanied

she struggles past the DOORMAN into the building, shouting
commands at the hysterical animal which it completely ig-
nores,.

INT. CC AND JOHN'S APARTMENT ~- DAY ©

We hear a key in the leck, then the door opens and CC is
pulled in by the dog. She gratefully drops the suitcase
to the floor.

ce
(happy shout)
John: I'm back: Where
. are you?:
There is no answer as she releases the dog from the leash.
She straightens up and glances around anxiously as he runs
off down the hall,

ec
(soft, scared)
John..?

Silence. CAMERA FOLLOWING she walks down the hall and turns
into his study. Pictures have been removed from the walls
and shoved clumsily into boxes, along with books, scripts,
ete.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE OF EAST SIDE THEATER - DAY

CC walks rapidly down the seedy street with a set, tense
expression on her face, staring at the sidewalk as she
goes. When she reaches the theater she hesitates, almost
as if she is afraid of entering, then she runs up the steps
and goes inside.

INT. EAST SIDE THEATER - LOUNGE - DAY

The place is empty. CC walks down the hall to John's office.
INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - DAY

CC stops in the doorway. The room is empty, but a couple
of open suitcases holding John's clothes sit on the couch.
She hears a noise in the main part of the theater.

INT. MAIN PART OF THEATER - DAY

Holding a seript, John is moving some furniture around on
@ set when CC bursts into the room,

ce
: (upset)
I've been looking everywhere
for you:

He tarns and looks at her calmly as she walks over to him.

JOHN
I'm restaging the third
\ act of Fly By Night. It’s
too stiff.

She stares at him, shaken by his cool composure, then walks
over to him slowly.

ce
(nervous)
How come you packed your
things? ,
(small laugh)
Not moving out, are you?

JOnN
Yes. I an.

They stand staring at each other, then she sinks down
onto the set couch.

- ce

(desperate)
I was only kidding when I
left: .I never meant to stay
away for good!

Waen she gets no response, her eyes begin to fill with tears,
then with a deep sob she slowly lowers her face to her knees.
John quickly sits down next to her and gently strokes her
hair as she cries,

ce
Why is this happening?
He shrugs, very upset.

JOHN
We want different things
out of life, that's all.

ce
But I lwe you.

JOHN
T know. I love you too.
(slightly amazed)
Do you realize I was ac~
tually faithful to you all
this time?

She straightens up.

ce
(astonished)
You're kidding. I always
thought you were having affairs.

They ponder this surprising bit of information for a mo-
ment, then she looks at him.

She stares

cc
(heartbroken)
Then why is everything
falling apart?

JOHN
Love's not enough.
(leoking away)
My idea of what's important

Let's just say I'm not an
uptown type.

Big deal; We'll live down-

That's not what I mean.

I don't care about success
the way you do, CC. Moving

interest me.

ce
(suddenly angry)
Why not?: Are you such a
great artist you're too good
for it or something?:

JOHN

(tough)
I'm just more interested
in other things - the work
itself, discovering what's
new, taking a chance on the
unknown.

Don't you get it? I don't
want to go where you're go-

I want to spend my life.

Okay. I won't go.

JOHN

You're already gone, Cecilia.
You're long gone.

Her eyes fill with tears as they stare at each other.

cc
(heartbroken)
Better lucky than good, huh..?

John reaches out and gently moves her hair away from her
face. .
. JOHN
Yeah. Better lucky than
good.

They stare at each other, then they hold eacn other,
rocking slightly, as she cries. She leans back to look
at him.

cc
(small voice)
Will you take Arthur...?

JOHN
(horrified)
Are you out of your mind?

They go back to holding each other. John's eyes have
tears in them.

CLOSE ON AN ALMOND JOY as a woman's hand rips it up from
a make-up strewn counter and frantically tears the wrapper
off.

INT. MAKE-UP TRAILER - SOUND STAGE = DAY

Wearing a robe, CC sits in front of a mirror clutching the
candy bar while a tough-looking WOMAN in late middle-age
paints her face. CC looks terrible - overweight, skin
pasty, eyes puffy, hair brittle, ete.

ce
Sure I did. They're
smaller, aren't they?

WOMAN
Smaller? Those aren't

INT. SOUND STAGE - MOVIE SET - DAY

A scene is in progress and is being watched by a silent
CREW, The set is a seedy hotel room. CC sits on the bed
dressed in a cheap wrapper, looking like a tart, while a
MAN her age gets dressed.

ee
(lighting cig-
arette, upset)
How can you just leave,
Freddie? The only thing
that kept me going was wait-
ing for you to come back...
(jumping up, stubb-
ing out cigarette)
This doesn't work for me:

The other actor spins around with a groan and slams his
fist against the wall as the buzzer sounds, the stage ex~

_plodes with noise and the DIRECTOR, a pinched-looking man

in middle-age, walks over to her with a lethal look on his
face,

DIRECTOR
What's wrong this time?:

ce
I just wouldn't do that:

DIRECTOR
(soft, explosive)
Do what..?

cc
Beg that asshole to stick
around after he screwed my
sister and stole my Winnebago;
I'm not that kind of person:
I mean, why would someone like
me ever do such a pathetic thing?:

DIRECTOR
(suddenly screaming)

Because you are playing a pros-
titute named Loretta, not your-
self, so will you please just
worry about the terrifying way
you look these days and let me
worry about the script:

ec
(shouting)
How can I? The script is al-
_ Most as shitty as your direc=
tion:

He stares at her, then suddenly slaps her hard in the face.
Everyone on the set freezes in shock. She recovers her
balance, then as her eyes fill with tears of pain and hum-
iliation, she suddenly swings hard and punches him full in
the face. He goes down like a piece of lead.

IN«. HILLARY'S KITCHEN - BOSTON = DAY

It is a complete mess. Her hair stringy and uncombed,
Hillary sits at the counter in front of a small t.v. which
is tuned to a soap opera, looking through a paper. She is
dressed in a ratty housecoat over an even rattier nigit-
gown, argyle anklets and large fuzzy slippers and her face
has a haggard cast to it. A moment passes and a shanty—
Irish cleaning woman in her fifties, MAURA, wearing a slo-
venly uniform, walks in with a lit cigarette stuck in her
mouth and an armload of dirty sheets which she drops on
the floor near the sink. She goes to the counter and pours
herself more coffee.

MAURA
Anything happen?

Hillary glances at her with dull eyes.

HILLARY
Yes. They had to call the
paramedics for Anita's back
and Glenn took the job at the
ear dealership after all.

Maura sits down and opens a tabloid. They read in silence
for a moment, listening to the soap.

MAURA
(reading, soft)
Amazing.
HILLARY
Wnat?
MAURA

(reading, smoking)
According to this article
Russian scientists replaced
a human eye with a fish eye
and it worked.

Maura! at ¥

MAURA
Yeah?

HILLARY
You didn't do any laundry
last week. Will you be sure
i to finish it today?

MAURA
(reading, smoking)
! Sure, honey. I'm just wait-
‘ ing for some of that hardened
dirt to come off those dishes
in the sink and I'll start on
the coloreds.

Do leaps out of her seat in a panic.

HILLARY
(frantic)
Mr. Hamilton: IZ don't want
' him to see me like this:

MAURA
(going back to
paper, disgusted)
You always say that and it's
never him. He hasn't even
called you once since he moved
in with the other one.

HILLARY
(shrill fury)
Who cares?: I told you to
answer the door and I want
you to answer it now!

Maura slowly looks up from her paper, deeply offended.

MAURA
You have no right to talk
~~ to me that way, Mrs. Hamilton,
just because I've had a less
fortunate life than you have.

The doorbell rings again. Hillary glares at her, then

spins on her heel and stalks from the room. Maura goes
back to her paper with an insulted sniff.

INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

It is also a mess. Hillary reaches the door, hesitates
anxiously, smoothing her hair and rearranging her dread-
ful housecoat, then, her back very straight and head held
high, she pulls open the door. She stares in shock. CC
stares back apprehensively looking even worse than she did
on the movie set, wearing & voluminous sweat suit and very
dark glasses, A taxi is waiting in the street.

HILLARY

Hillary stares at her with dazed, unbelieving eyes.

HILLARY
Yes. Very long.

Oh, yeah? Well, you're not
exactly a fashion plate your-
self, you know?

(Hillary's eyes

£ill with tears;

HILIARY
(emotional, battling
sobs)

Oh, CC, you have no idea how
much I've missed you: Will
you ever forgive me for those
terrible things I said?:

ec
(emotional, re-
lieved)
Me forgive you?: I came here
to ask you to forgive me:

HILLARY

For what? All you did was
tell the truth. I was so
jealous of you for doing
everything you said you
were going to do I couldn't
see straight.

{low, ashamed)
And because John was so ob-
viously in love with you.

ec
(misexable shrug)
Yeah, well, that's all water
under the bridge now. We
broke up.

Oh, no: ® ¥

cc nods, then sinks down onto the step. Hillary sits
down next to her.

ec
It really did me in. Tf

down my first movie.

HILLARY

Wnat happened?

cc

I was a little edgey, that's

I also broke the director's

jaw.

Oh, but that's not the worst

He died...

just like that:

HILLARY
At least he didn't suffer,

(tortured)
No, but the thing is I al-
ways thought I hated him
when I really loved him so
I never showed it: He never
knew how much I really cared!

I'm sure he guessed. You .
mustn't torture yourself about
it now.

sings along with the others.

Shine forth upon our clouded hills? |
And was Jerusalem builded here

Hillary suddenly grabs CC's hand and puts it on her sto-

Did your wife think it

It was before we were married.

Queen Mother outfit. An ELDERLY WOMAN is at the gilt and
white baby grand piano and Richard's MOTHER, a large, bossy
woman in her late sixties is holding out the receiver of

MOTHER
C'mon, Ceece. Just one
little tune so my sister
Esther knows it's you!

Just one song. You'll make

die any minute and who has
a skin disease that would make
you faint a very happy woman.

CC stares at her, then smiles sweetly.

Okay, Lillian.

It's for you. Your agent.

awake, then gets up and quickly walks out of the room.

As Hillary sits down at the table she glances at the cover -

I feel terrible about it.
HILLARY
Then have the decency to tell
him you're leaving:

Pause. CC looks up at her.

ec
I will...but I was just won-
dering..

HILLARY
(wary)
Wondering what?

ec
(innocent)
Well, it's just that I'm
in such a mad rush to make
the next shuttle and...

HILLARY
(low, hard)
No.

ce
(ignoring her,
eajoling)
I just thought it might
be better if you...

HILLARY
(hard, loud)
No, no, no, no.

EXT. HILLARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hillary stands in the open doorway in front of Richard
who stands on the steps holding a corsage in a plastic
box.

RICHARD
(stunned) :
She's gone? Just like that?

HILLARY
(desperate)
It's the part of a lifetime,
Richard,
(frantic)
Won't you come in for a drink?
We could talk better inside.
87.

RICHARD
(heartbroken)
No, no, I'd rather not...
(confused, wounded)
ZI don't understand it. Just
yesterday she was talking
about becoming a nurse,

Hillary looks away, He stares at the ground, shattered,
then suddenly thrusts the corsage at her.

RICHARD :
You might as well have this.

HILLARY
Oh, thank you, Richard. It's
lovely.
. (desperate)
- Are you sure you won't come in?

RICHARD
(backing down steps)
No, no, thank you... -
(walking away)
Goodnight, Hillary, and thanks.

She watches him as he disappears into the night, then
with a little sigh she takes the corsage out of the box
and pins it on as she shoves the door shut with her hip.
EXT, WEST FORTY= SEVENTH STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

CC walks to a large theater, a nervous look on her face,
and enters.

INT. THEATER - DAY
It is empty and dimly lit, the stage set for a performance.
The door is pushed open and CC walks in. She glances around.
cc
Hello? Anybody here?
No answer, She walks to the stage, mounts it and stands
staring out at the empty seats for a moment, then there is

a sound to her left and she turns. John Chase walks Slowly
toward her from the wings.

JOHN
Hi, cc. .

He stops next to her, She smiles nervously.

ce
You haven't changed.

JOHN
Neither have you.
Pause.

She stares at

I couldn't believe it

JOHN

I heard you weren't busy.

(soft, dry)
I bet.

JOHN

And you're the only person
talented enough te play the
part. Will you do it? Even
though I'm directing?

onto the street and pause.

cc
Rehearsals start Monday?

JOHN
Ten sharp. Want a taxi?

How's your wife?

JORN
Just great.

ce
(tense smile)
And the baby?
BBA,

JOHN
A real terror.
(sudden, tense)
How are you, CC? In love
with anybody?

She stares at him, then shrugs lightly.
89.

ec
No. I try, but it never seems
to work. But don't worry.
(£lippant)
I'll get over you yet.

She turns and starts walking away.

JOEN

(sudden, emotional)
cc:

(she looks back)
For whatever it's worth, I've
never loved anybody as mich
as I loved you.

(silence)
I've often wondered if we
should have stayed together.

Pause,

ce
(quiet)
Maybe we should have. The
point is, we didn't.

With a slight wave, she turns and walks off down the
street. She locks sad and moved by their exchange, but
she also looks as if a weight has been lifted from her.

INT. . BOSTON SHUTTLE DEPARTURE LOUNGE - LA GUARDIA AIRPORT -
MORNING - THE PRESENT

Wrapped in her fur coat, CC is curled up in a chair,

fast asleep, completely oblivious to the activity around
her. Through the window we see the airfield bathed in
brilliant sunlight, it has stopped snowing, machines are
Clearing the field and a healthy crowd is preparing to

board the shuttle. The attendant walks over to CC and gently
shakes her shoulder. She opens her eyes looking confused.

ATTENDANT
We're boarding right away,
Misa Bloom.

She quickly straightens up witn excitement.

ce
Thank God: Do I have
time to make a phone call?

ATTENDANT
I don't think so. We're :
taking off imnediately.
But you'll be in Boston in
an hour.

As he walks away, CC stands up and stretches her cramped
limbs, a happy, relieved expression on her face.

INT, PLANE - MORNING

As the plane takes off from the snowy field, CC rests her
face against the glass, staring out at the blinding light,
lost in thoughts that amuse her.

INT. .HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

As Hillary, who is in labor, is moved from her bed onto
a guerney by ATTENDANTS, CC stands slightly away from
her clutching a surgical gown, a look of sick terror on
her face. She is now wearing designer punk clothes and
has a green streak through her very red hair. |

HILLARY
(furious, panting)
What do you mean you can't
do it?!

cc
(frantic)
Just what I said! You
know how some people are
afraid of snakes?!

HILLARY
(shrieking)
What does that have to do
with anything?

cc
I'm afraid of blood and
@eath and medical instru-
ments: I can't. even stand
to hear someone say mucuous

HILLARY
(raging, reacting
to contractions)
Yau promised to be my part-
ner in this:

INT, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
ec goes after the querney as it is wheeled down the hall.

cc
(offended)
What do you mean by that?

Throughout this Hillary responds to her contractions.

HILLARY
I mean have you forgotten
the time you left me waiting
in the lobby of the Plaza
Hotel and you never showed
up?! .

. cc
I cannot believe you're bring-
ing this up again:

HILLARY
It was the most inconsiderate
thing anyone has ever done to
me:

cc
I explained what happened
a hundred times: I went to
the Iranian Queen for a pedi-
CUTE.coe

She's so caught up in the story she doesn't notice that
they are slamming into the delivery room.

RICHARD :

Cc quickly turns and her eyes meet Richard's as the delivery
team starts setting Hillary up.

ec
(nervous)
Richard.

They stare at each other, emotionally shaken by the reunion.
Pause,
92.
RICHARD
(sudden)

Congratulations on your play.
I hear it's a hit.

ce
Yeah. Thanks.

(pause, soft)
Congratulations on your
engagement. I hear she's
a wonderful person.

As they stare at each other, caught up in the moment, Hillary
suddenly grabs CC's hand and clutches it tightly in response
to a severe contraction, which breaks the spell. Richard
swings into action, issuing instructions to the delivery
team, and CC looks around the room with horror.

cc
(soft, stunned)
How did I get in here?

HILLARY

(panting)
Will you stay?

c¢ leoks at her, glances around the room once -again, her
gaze comes to rest on a tray of instruments and she faints
dead away.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

cc is fast asleep in a chair. Hillary is in bed with her
new born baby, looking exhausted but blissfully happy. A
moment passes, CC turns, stirs, then her eyes open. The
first thing she sees is Hillary and the baby. She stares
with amazement.

ec
(soft)
It's over?

Hillary looks at her and nods. CC gets up and walks over,
looking at the baby with wonder and delight. ~

ce
What is it?

HILLARY
A girl.
(sudden, intense)
Remember this.
93.

What?

HILLARY
This moment. It's the
happiest one of my entire
life. Remember it for me.

Victoria jumps up from the mirror she was looking into.

VICTORIA
Nothing:

INT, VICTORIA'S BEDROOM = DAY

It is a cheerful child's room filled with books, old toys,
drawings stuck to the walls, maps, cluttered desk, etc.
Victoria, who is wearing a school uniform, rips the slip off
her head and quickly grabs her bookbag and jacket from the bed.

VICTORIA
I was just looking for my
jacket;

As she starts out of the room, she pauses in front of a
wall calendar and crosses off the day, like all the days be-
fore it, with a large, careful black “x", The calendar

is for June 1987. Written across the bottom of the month,
in large black letters, is "NO MORE SCHOOL?" Victoria flies
out of the room.

Tne front door is open and Hillary is wating in it. She is

wearing @ suit and holding a briefcase and in middle-age

is as beautiful as ever, however, her face is drawn and
tired. Victoria runs noisily down the steps, then as she
heads for the door she suddenly Sweeps a cat up from a chair
into her arms. :

VICTORIA

(hugging cat,

waltzing to door,

singing)
Pouncer, Pouncer the wonder cat
I'm so glad you're not a rat
or a bat
or too fat...

HILLARY
(exploding)
Goddamn it, put that cat ~
down now and let's go!

She turns and storms out of the house. Victoria looks at
her with surprise, sheepishly puts the cat down and quickly
goes after her, shutting the door behind her.

INT. HILLARY'S CAR -DAY

As Hillary and Victoria talk, the car approaches a school
attached to the Episcopal Church, which is surrounded by

a sea of babbling children in uniforms. Hillary is slightly
short of breath and very pale.

HILLARY
You may invite Melissa to
visit the last week in Au-
gust, not before!

VICTORIA
But I thought she could stay
the whole month: I already
told her. :

Hillary stops the car at the curb.

HILLARY
Then untell her. I want
this summer at the Cape to
be peaceful. I have a flu
I can't shake, I'm tired and
I don't want to spend my time
taking care of anyone else's
children, understood?

VICTORIA
But who will I play with..?
95.

HILLARY
The same children you've been
playing with every summer since
you were born. The ones who
live there.

Hillary leans across, opens the passenger door and gives
Victoria a kiss.

HILLARY
I'm late.

Victoria gives her a wounded look, then gets out of the
ear. Hillary suddenly looks remorseful.

HILLARY
I'm sorry, puss, but I‘m
just very tired.

VICTORIA
(slamming door)
You're always tired.

Hillary watches her run off into the sea of children, call-
ing her friends’ names, then takes a deep breath and drives
away.

her breath. .

INT. LOBBY OF COURTHOUSE - DAY .

calls to her from nearby.

LAWYER

minute?

less)
Just. I'm due in court right

He walks over to her and they start up the steps, CAMERA

HILLARY

(breathless)
I bet they do. Forget it.

LAWYER
C'mon,Hillary. Get off your
high moral horse for a change.”
Going to court isn't going to
change anything, it's just going
to complicate what should be a
simple financial deal for your
client and mine.

During this, Hillary has been climbing the steps with a
pained frown on her face. With each step she becomes more
and more short of breath, more and more fatigued. Just as
she reaches the top, she suddenly stops, & terrified ex-
pression on her face, then she collapses onto the step,
gasping for air. The lawyer quickly leans down to her, fri-
ghtened.

tal signs.

INT, HILLARY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

It is £illed with flowers. Victoria walks up to the bed,

bag and straightens cut the covers. Hillary slowly opens

her eyes, recognizes her daughter and hugs her tightly.

HILLARY
(happy, surprised)
Hi, puss, what are you do-
ing here alone?

She lets Victoria go and leans back into her pillows, fati-
gued, Victoria sits in the chair next to the bed, never
taking her eyes off her mother.

VICTORIA
Aunt Vesta's talking to the
doctor.
(pause, scared)
Are you okay?

HILIARY
Sure I am. I,'11 be home

Victoria stares at her, still scared.

VICTORIA
What's wrong with you?

BILLARY
(reassuring)
I caught a virus, that's all.

VICTORIA
(puzzled)
In your heart..?

HILLARY
(quiet)
Who told you that?

VICTORIA

Hillary stares at her, then looks away,

HILLARY
(soft, even)
Yes. I caught a virus in
my heart.

INT. HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

It is packed with STUDENTS preparing for exams. Looking

fragile and very pale, Hillary enters the library and goes
to the desk where the LIBRARIAN, a man in his late twenties
vith? gentile face is working. The large wall clock reads

diously making notes, The librarian glances at her as he
locks his desk and picks up his jacket. The wall clock
reads 6:00.

LIBRARIAN

Hillary looks up in surprise.

HILLARY
Oheee
(leeking at books)
I see.

As he walks over to her:

LIBRARIAN
I can put a hold on those
books for another day if
you want.

She slowly looks up at him with a dazed smile as she ga-
thers her papers together.

HILLARY
Oh, thanks, but that won't
be necessary. I've got all
I need.

As he starts stacking the books back on the trolley, she
gets up, drops her glasses and papers into her purse, slips
on her jacket and starts walking away.

HILLARY
Goodnight.
99.

LIBRARIAN
(working)
Goodnight.

She walks a few yards, then she suddenly leans heavily
against one of the tables and breaks into a deep, gut-
wrenching sob. The librarian quickly looks up in alarm,
then stares helplessly as Hillary sinks down into a chair,
puts her hands over her face and sobs with complete aban-
don.:

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

A full orchestra is backing CC up as she sings @ ballad.
She is thin and vibrant-looking, at the peak of her powers
as a performer and a woman. She screws up a lyric, apolo-
gizes to the producer and orchestra, then after a little
amiable laughter, they start up again. She sings the song
through to the end perfectly.

EXT. CC'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A taxi pulls up, the DOORMAN opens the door and CC climbs

ang medication litters the bedside table. CC paces the
room, carefully avoiding looking at Hillary.

ce

(frantic)
Why didn't you tell me
when it first happened?.
I mean, it's unbelievable
that you can just get some-
thing like this out of the
blue:

{darting her a look)
So what do you have to do?

HILLARY
(shrugging)
A few things. I've chosen
medication and rest.

Pause.

cc
(soft, scared)
And you'li get better..?

Hillary stares out the window in silence. CC suddenly
snatches up a bouquet of flowers from the bureau and
quickly walks to the door.

ec
(frantic)
I'd better get these
101.

cc (cont'd.)
flowers in some water soon
or they'll die! I mean wilt:
fhey'11 wilt! Not...you know...

HILLARY
(sudden)

CC turns to look at her apprehensively from the doorway.

ec
Yeah?

HILLARY
(quiet)

toria to the Cape for the
summer, but we can't go alone.

cc
(soft, scared)
Oh, right.
(pause, desperate)
‘Don't worry about it:
I'll hire a nurse:

Hillary looks away.

HILLARY
(quiet)
Thanks, CC, but I can do
that myself. You'd better
put those flowers in water
before they die.

INT, HILLARY'S HALLWAY - DAY

As CC walks down the hall, looking very upset, she passes
a table holding a phone and a number of framed photographs.
She suddenly stops and stares at one with surprise, drops
the flowers onto a chair and picks it up.

framed photograph.

cc
This picture of us from
Atlantie City.

Hillary glances at it, then looks back out the window.

HILLARY
(uninterested)
Victoria found it in a box.

Silence as-CC studies the photograph, in torment.

ce
(sudden, nervous)
You know, once I finish
the album I'm free for a
few weeks until rehearsals
start for the new show.

HILLARY
(remmte)
That's nice.

Pause.

ec
(sudden, tense)
Maybe I could go to the
Cape with you instead of
a nurse.

Hillary keeps her face turned away, but her eyes fill
with tears.

HILLARY
(soft, even)
Thanks, CC. I'd like that.

CC gives her a shakey smile.

ec
Hey. We're friends, aren't we?

Are you okay?:

HILLARY
Yes. Why?

You made a noise.

HILLARY
I did not make a noise.

ce
I heard you make a noise.

HILLARY
I did not make a noise and
what are you doing?:

CC is practically picking Hillary up to put her in the
front seat of the car.

: ec :
Helping you into the car.

HILLARY
(tried patience)
That's very kind of you, CC,
but I still have the use of
my legs.

As CC walks around to the driver's side in a huff.

> cc
I was just being helpful.

HILLARY
(climbing into car,
to Victoria)
Get in the car, Victoria.

Victoria stands on the sidewalk looking at her with out-
rage.

VICTORIA
But I always sit in front
with you:

HILLARY

I know, but CC's driving so
you have to get in the ck.
104.

victoria glances at CC with resentment, then:

‘VICTORIA
Will you sit in the back with
me?

BILLARY

There isn't enough room.

Victoria hesitates, then flops into the back seat with
a sullen look and yanks the car door shut.

INT. CAR - DAY

As the car pulls away from the curb, Victoria suddenly
moves forward, squeezes her body into the space between
the two front seats and puts her hand on top of Hillary's
head. .

VICTORIA
When we get there will you
go swimming with me, Mom?

HILLARY
(tight)
I can't go swimming.
(bright)
But CC will, won't you, CC?

VICTORIA
(sullen)
Never mind. I'11 go by myself.

ec
(stung, childish)
Be my guest: Who said I
wanted to swim anyway:

They sink into a silence.

HILLARY
(sudden, tense)
That's not very comfortable,
dear.

VICTORIA
What?

HILLARY
Riding in the car with your
hand on my head.

victoria hesitates, then pulls her hand away, drops back
into her seat and looks out the window unhappily.

The car moves along through the sunlight past the dunes.

You are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy
when skies are grey...

Hillary's wristwatch alarm goes off and she stops singing
as she takes several pills from bottles in her purse and
swallows them with water from a canteen. Victoria watches
her with an anxious expression. -
CC/VICTORIA

(voices fading)
You'll never know dear
how much I love you
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

They all sink into their own thoughts.

EXT, SUMMER HOUSE - DAY

It is a turn-of-the-century, weathered woodframe house
with rambling porch and garden bordered by the beach.

CC and Victoria are unloading the car. CC puts a hibachi
on the right side of the porch.

VICTORIA
That doesn't go there.

Victoria moves it to the left side of the porch.
cc
(brittle smile)
Thank you, dear.
As they go back to unpacking the car:
VICTORIA
(sudden)
Are you staying all summer?

ce
It looks like it.
106,

VICTORIA
(sharp)
Why?

CC gives her a glance as she pots a deck chair in the
sand near the porch.

cc
To help your mother.

VICTORIA
(upset)
She doesn't need you to help
her, she has me:
(in tears)
And the chair doesn't go
there, it goes on the porch:

She rips up the chair, runs up the steps, slams it down
on the porch and races into the house.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ashen-faced and almost whimpering, CC takes a vial of
medicine from the refrigerator and fills a needle.
Hillary leans against the counter next to her. CC

turns to Hillary with the needle and freezes with fear.”
They stare at each other, then Hillary takes the needle
from her and awkwardly injects herself in the arm. CC
sinks into a chair and takes deep breaths, trying to keep
from fainting.

EXT. CAPE COD BEACH ~ DAY

Hillary sits on a low beach chair under an umbrella wear-
ing a sunhat, sweater and a blanket over her legs, reading
a book. Wearing a bathing suit and still wet from a swim,
victoria sits next to har on the blanket. She is looking
at Hillary's hands carefully.

VICTORIA
(sudden)
We have the same hands
don't we, Mom?

Hillary looks at her with mild surprise, Victoria holds
up her hand and Hillary raises hers next to it.

HILLARY
{slight smile)
You're right, we do. We
have exactly the same hands.
 

107.

As Hillary goes back to her book, Victoria studies her
own hand thoughtfully.

INT. HILLARY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wearing a nightgown, Hillary is pulling a large, card-
board box down from the shelf, slightly out of breath.
The room is littered with boxes, some torn open and spill-
ing contents. Letters and photographs litter the floor.
An urgent look on her face, Hillary drops the box to the
floor and rips the top open. She starts rummaging fran-
tically around inside, looking for something, tossing
things to the floor impatiently. A moment passes, then
CC appears in the doorway, rubbing her eyes, suntanned
and wearing a huge t-shirt.

ce
What are you doing...?
It's three in the morning...

Hillary darts her a haunted look as she rummages in the box.

HILLARY
Looking for a picture:

Cc walks further into the room, more alert.

ec
Are you crazy?! You're
not supposed to be lifting
things and..

HILLARY
(cutting in,
hysterical)
I don't care: It's a pic-
ture of my mother and I
have to find it:

She suddenly stops and slowly looks around the room at the
things strewn on the floor.

HILLARY
(soft, frightened)
I couldn't remember her hands.

She suddenly sits heavily on the bed and puts her hands
over her face. -

HILLARY
(desperate)
I'm so scared, CC? I'm
just so scared:

CC watches helplessly as Hillary rocks back and forth
108.

Slightly, her face covered. CC suddenly kneels down and
starts going through the photographs. As she empties
another box onto the floor, Hillary finally lowers her
hands from her face and takes a deep breath. She wetches
Cc for a moment, then kneels down next to her and without
a word also starts to go through the photographs. They
work side by side in silence, then CC finally holds out a
picture to her, ,
ce
Is this it..?

Hillary takes it and stares at it.

HILLARY
(quiet)
Yes, it is. Thank you.

INT. HALLWAY ~ MORNING

In her nightgown, Victoria comes out of her room and
walks to the bathroom, which is still steamy. She stops
in the doorway. A wet towel is on the floor.

VICTORIA
Mom?! (sharp cry)

A second later, Hillary's bedroom door opens and she steps
into the hall, wearing a robe and looking very tired.

HILLARY
What?

VICTORIA
(outraged)
CC*s towel is on the floor!

Hillary looks at her as if she is insane.

HILLARY
Well, pick it up!

VICTORIA
(priggish)
If I leave my towel on the
floor you alwaya make me
pick it up myself,

Before Hillary can respond, CC's door slams open and she
stalks out. Without a word, she brushes past Victoria,
tips the towél up, folds it and hangs it on the rack.

ce

{acid smile)
Happy, dear?!
109.

She stalks back into her room and slams the door.
victoria enters the bathroom and also slams the door.
Hillary rests her head against the doorframe with a groan.
She looks very ill.

EXT. MEADOW - CAPE COD - DAY

Filled with wildflowers, bordered by a stream and woods
and the sea visible in the distance, it is an idyllic spot.
Hillary and Victoria are on the blanket playing a board
game.while CC unloads a picnic basket.

ce
Egg salad for you, Hill?

HILLARY
Yes, please.

Victoria snatches the sandwhich from CC.

VICTORIA
I'll give it to her.

They glare at each other, then as Victoria hands the
sandwhich to her mother, CC pulls another one out of the
basket.

ce
(hard) .
Here's your chicken sal-
ad, Victoria, dear.

Victoria looks at her.

VICTORIA
But I don't like chicken
salad.
cc
(grim)

When I asked you what you
wanted you said chicken
salad,

VICTORIA
I did not.

HILLARY
What difference does it
make? You like egg salad
so take mine.

Victoria and CC ignore her, fully engaged in battle now,
cc

You dia too: You said
chicken salad on wheat:
110.

VICTORIA
I didn't! I just said chic-
ken on wheat:
(petulant)
I don't like it when it's
chopped up.

cc
(exploding)
What the hell difference
does that make?! Chicken's
chicken, mayo's mayo...

Hillary is on her feet.

HILLARY
(shrieking)
I can't take this anymore:
I've had enough of this
endless bickering and...

She suddenly puts her hand to her chest and. leans her
weight against Victoria as she slowly sinks to her knees
on the blanket, a terrified expression on her face.

HILLARY
. _ (soft, gasping)
My chest hurts...I can't
breathe...it's bad, CC...

CC stares at her, then suddenly grabs her purse and rips
the keys out.

ce
(to Victoria)
Can you start a car?:

Victoria neds, her eyes wide with fear and shock,
and CC throws the keys at her.

ce
Do it:
(embracing Hillary)
Try to stand up. I can't
earry you.

As Victoria runs to the car,. jumps in and starts it,

CC half-drags Hillary to the car, helps her into the
back seat, then slides into the front, shoving Victoria
to the side. The car skids along the dirt track as CC
pulls the door shut.

INT. CAR - DAY

As the car pulls onto the road and takes off, victoria
lll.

climbs into the back and puts her arms around her
mother, Crying. Hillary is breathing with great diffi-
culty and_locks as if she is in great pain.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - EVENING

Victoria sits alone, looking very young and very lost. A
moment passes, then CC appears in the doorway looking ex-
hausted.

ec
She's fine, Victoria.

VICTORIA
Can I see her..?

cc
The doctor said: tomorrow.
She's sleeping now.

They stare at each other, then CC suddenly holds out her
hand.

cc
Let's go home.

Victoria hesitates for a moment, then gets up and slowly
walks over to her. She pauses, then:

VICTORIA
(soft)
I'm sorry.

ec
I know. So am If.
(faint smile)
You're like me. You get
mean when you're scared.

Victoria stares at her, then with a small sigh slips her
hand into CC's outstretched one with relief and trust.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As CC and Victoria walk down the hall hanc in hand, Vic-
toria suddenly looks at her. :

VICTORIA
Is my mother going to die?

CC quickly looks at her, then smiles reassuringly.

ce
What are you talking about?
She's sick because her medi-

cation's not right, that's
all! She'll be home in a
couple of days:

Victoria looks away with relief. As they exit the build-
ing, CC is fighting back tears.

EXT. SHORELINE - LOW TIDE - SUNSET

Wearing sweaters, their pants rolled up, CC and Victoria
are clamming. SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE are doing the same
thing a short distance away.

VICTORIA
(excited, embarr-
assed laugh)
I can't do that: -

cc
Why not? You think you'll
get arrested?

Victoria glances at the other people with a shy laugh.

VICTORIA
Those people will see me:

ec
So what? We're not asking
them to pay, are we? C'mon.

She suddenly straightens up, sandy hands clutching clams.

cc
(singing)
First you put your two knees
close up tight...
(stern)
I seem to be the only one
singing:

Victoria glances at the people with an excited laugh, then .
looks back at CC with bright eyes. She shyly starts sins~
ing along with her, copying her movements.

CC/VICTORIA

(singing, dancing)
Then you swing them to the left
and you swing them to the right
you waik around the floor
kind of nice and light
and then you twist around
and twist around...
113.

Victoria twists so violently she loses her footing and
falls into the wet sand, laughing loudly.

ce
(singing, laughing)
with all of your might...

Soaked and covered with sand, Victoria quickly gets up
and continues with the song and dance, happy and noisy
now, completely unself-conscious.

CC/VICTORIA
(singing, dancing)
Spread your loving arms
way out in space...

EXT. PORCH ~ HILLARY'S SUMMER HOUSE - SUNSET

Hillary sits in a chair watching CC and Victoria on the
beach. Their voices drift tinnily up from the water's
edge.

CC/VICTORIA
. (laughing, dancing)
And then you do the Eagle Rock
with style and grace...

Hillary suddenly gets up, goes into the house and slams
the screen door behind her. CC and Victoria, silhouetted
against a brilliant sunset, continue dancing happily in
the sand, their voices drifting. up to the empty porch.

CC/VICTORIA
(singing, dancing)
You put your left foot out
and bring it back
and that's what I call
Balling The Jack.

INT, SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM ~ MORNING

Hillary, wearing a nightgown, is stretched out on the
couch, under a blanket in the semi-darkened room reading
a book. Pills litter a nearby table. Tne phone is ring-
ing 0.S., it is answered, then we hear: :

ce
(shout 0.8.)
Hillary: It's for you!

HILLARY
(reading, grim) .
Tell whoever it is I'm not
here,
114.

A moment passes, then CC walks in from the hallway wearing
a bathing suit and carrying a towel, suntan lotion and mag-

azines.

cc
(tense smile) .
You make me say that to
everyone. Your friends
will think I'm holding you
prisoner.

HILLARY
(reading)
I don't care what they think.

We can hear children playing outside. CC stares at her
for a moment, then heads for the door. Just as she reaches

it,

she turns back.

cc
We're going down to the
dock to buy steamers later.
Want to come?

HILLARY
(reading, sharp)
You know I can't walk that

far.
ec
I'll drive.
HILLARY
(reading)
I'd rather not.
cc
‘(belligerent)

Okay, then why don't you
get dressed and sit out-
side on the beach with us.

HILLARY

T‘m happy here.

(throwing down

book, furious)
So what?: Who the hell
are you?, The clothes
police?:

(getting up)
Just leave me alone, okay?
That's all I want: To be
left fucking alone:

Breathing harshly, she walks out of the room. A moment
later, we hear her bedroom door slam shut. CC hesitates,
then goes after her.

INT. HILLARY'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Hillary sits in a chair by the window staring out at tne
sea, her face. expressionless. There is a knock on the
door, but she doesn't respond. A second later, CC walxs
into the room.

cc
Listen, Hill, I'm sorry I
blew up like that. =
know how hard this is for..

HILLARY

(shrieking)
No, you don't:

(spinning around,

hard) :
You don't know what this i:
like at all: My chances of
seeing my child grow up are
next to nothing: My chances
of living a normal life have
vanished: My chances of even
living a few more years aren't
worth more than a two dollar
bet! Don't say you know what
that's like because you don't!
You're still in the land of the
living:

ce
(shouting)
So are you!

They stare at each other.
116.

ce
(fierce)
You're not dead yet, Hillary,
go stop living as if you are:

cc slams out of the room. Hillary stares at ‘the door,
showing no traces of emotion, then turns and looks back
out the window.

EXT. .SUMMER HOUSE - KITCHEN PORCH - DUSK

CC and Victoria are sitting on the steps snapping beans
while they watch CC give an interview to a smarmy, over~
dressed WOMAN interviewer on a amall television which is
propped in the open kitchen window. CC watches with an
anxious"expression on her face. Victoria is fascinated.

INTERVIEWER
(sincere)
Tell us the truth, CC.
Pull the stops out. We
know the star, but who is
the person. Who jis CC Bloom.

ec
(sick matter)
Don't do it; fool, don't do it...

ec

(on t.v.,

thoughtful)
Oh, Lala, you have no idea
how many times I have asked
myself that same question.
Who is CC Bloom. I suppose
first and foremost CC Bloom...
feels things! Deeply. cc is
a deeply feeling person and be-
cause of that she is deeply emo-
tional. Deeply feeling, deeply
emotional...

(wistful smile)
Can these things exist separately,
Lala? I don't think so.

cc groans.

INTERVIEWER

I'd like to know more about
this duality, CC, but we've.
run out of time. Thank you
for joining me on Star Talk...

(to audience)
And until tomorrow night
this is Lala Lake saying don't
judge, keep sharing.
117.

As the commercial comes on, CC gets up to turn off the
tev.

cc
(anxious)
So? Wnat'd you think?

Victoria shrugs slightly, her eyes averted.

VICTORIA
(matter)
I don't know...

c¢ turns to look at her.

ce
Please. I want the truth.
Victoria leoks up with a shrug.

VICTORIA
You sounded dumb.

CC's eyes become narrow and flinty as she snaps the t.v.
off with a hard twist.

ec

(sharp)
Yeah, well, I gave that
interview last year and
you have a lot to learn,
you know? Giving inter-

views isn't...

VICTORIA
Mom:

She is looking past CC with a happy smile. CC quickly
turns to see Hillary standing shyly in the doorway, dressed
in casual clothes, her hair washed and shining, a little
make-up on her face.

HILLARY
Hi, puss,

She darts CC a sheepish smile, then looks back at Victoria
as she walks out onto the porch.

HILLARY
I thought I'd help with
dinner. What can I do?

VICTORIA
Beans: Sit here:
cc watches Hillary as she walks over and takes Victoria’

seat on the steps, then as she starts snapping beans CC
goes back to her seat on the steps and does the same.

VICTORIA
Can I make braids?

HILLARY
Sure.

As Victoria happily starts braiding her mother's hair,
cc's and Hillary's eyes meet for a moment. Hillary's
glance is a thank you.

EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON

118.

On the shore we can see Victoria playing with a few FRIENDS.
CC and Hillary are sitting under an umbrella playing cards,

cc in her bathing suit, Hillary in shorts and t-shirt.

They play in silence for a moment, then CC smiles slightly

to herself. Hillary glances at her as she discards.

HILLARY
Why are you smiling..?

ce
Do you remember that |
Christmas we spent in the
loft? ~

HILIARY
(frowning, vague)
Sure...we had a tree, dida't
we..?

cc
A stick.
(shaking head)
I was just remembering those
stinking Christmas carols.

HILLARY
What Christmas carols?

oc

What Christmas carols?:
The ones you forced me to
sing every night.

HILLARY
t didn't force you: You loved
te

ec

By the time we hit Good King
Wenceslaus for the fifth time

I was ready for a draino cocktail:

HILLARY
Gin and game, as usual. :
(smug)
You will never beat me
at cards.

cc gives her a look as she gets up, tosses down her
ecards and grabs her bathing cap.
HILLARY
You make things up as
you go along, you know?

cc

(putting on cap)
No, I don't, so you had
better be very nice to me.

(threatening)
I know everytnang there is
to know about you, my friend,
arm my memory is long. My
memory is very, very long.

As CC turns and heads for the water, all traces of play-
fulness vanish from Hillary's face. She watches CC go
with a far-away look in her eyes.

HILLARY
(soft murmur}
I know. I'm counting on it.

CLOSE ON DESK CALENDAR

The date is December 1, 1987. As a child's hand comes
into frame and rips the page off, revealing December 2,
1987, we hear: :

HILLARY
(exasperated V.0.)
Have you lost your mind?:
What is all this stuff?!

CAMERA PULLS BACK
INT. VICTORIA'S BEDROOM - =AY

The sky outside is very grey. Two overflowing suitcases

are open on Victoria's bed. As Victoria tosses the cal-
endar page into the trash next to her desk and walks over

to the bed, Hillary turns to her with despair. She is
dressed casually in a large sweater ané tights and although
she is still beautiful, her looks are beginning to show signs
ef chronic ill-health - dark carcles around the eyes, deep
pallor, ete. °

VICTORIA
My clothes.
. 120.

HILLARY
{sorting through
bag)
You're going to New York
for two days in December:
(holding up bikini)
Why are you bringing this?:

VICTORIA
You never know what might
come up.

HILLARY
(holding up tennis
racket)
And this?:

VICTORIA
I told CC I'd teach her how
to play.

HILLARY
Not this weekend. She's giv-
ing a concert at Carnegie Hall.

Hillary overturns one of the suitcases onto the bed and
drops it to the floor.

HILLARY
Get my brown carry-on bag
-. €rom the hall closet. That's
Bll you're taking.

VICTORIA
But..

: HILLARY
No buts. Get it.

As Victoria turns to leave, Hillary suddenly stops and
stares out the window, her face lighting up like a child's.

HILLARY
Oh, Victoria, look: It's
snowing:

They quickly walk to the window and look out at the snow,
which is beginning to fall heavily.

HILLARY
(soft)
I love the first snow.

She suddenly turns, propelling Victoria to the door as
she rushes back to the bed.
121.

HILLARY
Get going: The taxi will
be here in less than five
minutes:

Victoria flies out of the room and we hear her banging
around in the hallway. Hillary looks at the mess on the
bed, then starts sorting through it. She laughs slightly
as she pulls a pair of hiking boots out of the pile, then
she suddenly stiffens, &@ strange, startled look on her
face. She drops the boots and reaches out for the bedpost,
knocking most of the clothes to the floor in the process,
clings to the bedpost for a moment, then slowly begins

to slide to the floor, gasping for air as she fails.

HILLARY
(choked cry)
Victoria...

Victoria appears in the doorway clutching a suitcase. She
stops and stares at her mother with stunned horror as Hillary
hits the floor, then she drops the bag and races over to her.

VICTORIA
, (terrified cry)
Mom?.

Hillary has lapsed into unconsciousness. Victoria sits
on the floor next to her and lifts her head into her lap,
sobbing with terror, rocking back and forth.

VICTORIA

(erying, frantic)
Please get up, Mom, please,
I don't know what to do,
please get up, oh please
get up.

EXT, STREET IN BOSTON - EARLY MORNING - THE PRESENT

A taxi moves cautiously along the snow-shrouded street.
INT. TAXI - EARLY MORNING

CC, looking exhaustec, sits stiffly in the back seat.
Silence except for the rattle of the chains on the wheels
and the dispatcher's voice crackling over the radio.

The taxi pulls to a halt. CC doesn't move.

DRIVER
This is it. Boston General

cC sits very still for a moment longer, then shoves some
large bills into the driver's hand.
122.

DRIVER
(shocked)
But this is way too much:

CC is out of the taxi. The door slams shut.

EXT, STREET OUTSIDE OF BOSTON GENERAL HOSPITAL - EARLY
MORNING

cc stands staring at the hospital entrance with a fear-
fal expression on her face, then she finally takes a deep
breath and goes inside.

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

As CC walks toward the elevators, she passes a flower shop.
She backtracks and goes inside. Through the window we

see her pick out a bunch of long-stemmed yellow roses, pay
for them, then return to the lobby. She reaches the
elevator just as the doors are closing and slips through.
They slam shut.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EARLY MORNING

CC exits the elevator and walks to the nurses’ station.
There is no one around. She looks around and spots the
entrance to the cardiac care unit and walks over to it.
Through the glass door, clearly marked NO ADMITTANCE we
can see cubicles containing beds and elaborate equipment.
A few of the beds are occupied. CC hesitates, then walks
in.

INT, CARDIAC CARE UNIT - EARLY MORNING

An anxious expression on her face she walks along, glancing
in the cubicles, then stops in front of one. Hillary is

in the bed, under the covers, slightly turned away. A
resuscitator is pushed to the side. CC hesitates, then
steps .inside.

INT. CUBICLE - EARLY MORNING

ec .
(soft, anxious)
Hill..? It's me...

No response. CAMERA MOVES WITH CC as she rounds the bottom
of the bed and comes up the other side to see Hillary's face
more clearly. Hillary's eyes are closed and she looks
utterly peaceful.

cc
Hill...?

She suddenly stops and stares, then her fingers go limp
123.
and the flowers slide out of her hand to the floor.

ce
(soft, stunned)
Oh, Hill...

A NURSE has walked up to the entrance to the cubicle.

NURSE
You will have to leave
right now: Didn't you
see that no admittance
sign on the...

ec
(sharp ery)
Get out:

The nurse hesitates, then backs out of the cubicle.
CC's eyes are riveted to Hillary's face as she moves
closer, then reaches out and gently touches her hair.

cc
{soft, amazed)
What will I do...?

She suddenly sinks heavily in the chair next to the bed
and takes her friend's lifeless hand, lowering her face
to the edge of the bed.

cc
(deep sob)
What will I do without
you..?

EXT, CEMETARY - BOSTON - DAY

Hillary's family and friends stand around an open grave,
next to her flower draped coffin, while an episcopal
PRIEST performs the burial service. CC stands with
Victoria, hand in hand. They both look as if they are
in shock. Snow is falling heavily again.

INT, HILLARY'S STUDY - DAY

CLOSE ON A WOMAN'S HAND holding a letter covered with a
childish scrawl. Other letters, written by a child,

are in her lap. The only sound is the ticking of a grand-
father clock. CAMERA PULLS BACK. CC sits at Hillary's
desk, which is covered with papers, staring off into space.

INT. VICTORIA'S ROOM - DAY

A tray of untouched food sits on the bedside table. Fully
dressed in the clothes she wore to the cemetary, Victoria
is stretched out on the bed, face down, completely cried

out. One arm is wrapped tightly around her cat. A

moment passes and there is a knock on the door. She doesn't
move. A second later, the door opens and cC walks in.

She looks at Victoria in silence for a moment, then walks
over and sits on the edge of the bed. She reaches out

and touches Victoria's coat.

cc
(soft)
That's wet. If you don't
take it off, you'll get
a cold.

Silence. CC looks away, at a loss, then looks back.

ec

Iwas just going through
your mother's papers,

(silence)
It's amazing..I found letters
I wrote to her over thirty
years ago...

(pause)
I couldn't believe it. She
saved every single one.

Silence. CC takes a deep breath.

ec
In her will she said she
wanted you to live with me.

Pause, then Victoria finally turns to look at her, her
eyes red and swollen from erying. CC reaches out and
brushes her hair away from her face.

cc
(soft, kind)
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to. Your
Aunt Vesta wants you, every
body wants you.

Victoria stares at her.

VICTORIA
(lew)
Can't I live here, in my
house?
Pause.

(soft)

No.

Victoria looks away. Silence.

VICTORIA
(sudden, low)
Does my father know she died..?

cc stiffens with surprise.

ce
I don't know.
(cautious)
I thought you didn't see him.

VICTORIA
(lew)
I know who he is. I saw him
in the street twice.

cc.
(anxious to please)
I could call him if you want.

VICTORIA

No.

Yeah, well, maybe someday..

If you want to stay in Bos-

a loss)
I mean, I don't know what
kind of mother I'd make,
You wouldn't want to know
what goes on inside my hea
sometimes...and I'm very sel-
fish, you know..?

(soft, stunned)
I don't know what she was
thinking of when she picked
me..

 

(quick, reassuring)
Not that I don't want to
do it! There's nothing I
want to do more than be with
you:

Pause, Victoria slowly turns to look at her again.
VICTORIA

If I go with you, can Tt

CC looks away as her eyes fill with tears.

ce
(low)
Oh, my God, of course
you can bring your cat.
You can bring anything
you want.

INT. VICTORIA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Most of her things are carefully packed away in boxes.

She is sitting in a small chair looking around the room
with wide, frightened eyes, wearing her coat, hat and
boots. Through the window we can see that the street is
covered by a deep layer of snow, the parked cars are
half-buried and more snow is falling. Her eat is curled up
in her lap. A moment passes, then:

INT, FRONT HALLWAY - MORNING

CO waits at the open front door in her fur coat and boots,
two suitcases in her hands, as Victoria comes down the
stairs. The furniture has been covered by dust sheets
and the place has an abandoned look to it.

. cc

The road isn't clear so

we'll have to walk a couple

of blocks for a taxi. Can

you make it? :
Victoria nods,’ pauses at the door to look around ence with
confused eyes, then she turns and walks out. CC also hesi-
tates, looking around the hall and remembering happier times
in that house, then she walks out and pulls the door shut
behind her, The lock clicks.

EXT, HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWING, CC and Victoria come down the front steps,
turn out the gate and start picking their way along the
snowy street in silence. CC finally glances at Victoria,
who is withdrawn and depressed.
127.

cc

(sudden)
Your mother and I met
in Atlantic City when we
were your age, did you know
that?

Victoria doesn't even look at her.

VICTORIA
Yes.

boardwalk smoking a cigar~

vietoria looks at her with interest for the first time.

VICTORIA
Mom didn't tell me that.
You amoked when you were
my age?:

cc
Yeah. I quit when I was
twelve. Anyway, I just
finished doing the matinee
at the Tony Grant Kiddie Show...

CAMERA STOPS FOLLOWING. As they walk on through the snowy
street their figures grow smaller, their voices indistinct.

ec
What song was I singing
then...oh, I remember:
My Mama number.

VICTORIA
What was that?

cc : .
(laughing, singing) ‘
You gotta see Mama
every night
or you can't see Mama at all...

Victoria says something to her, but we can't hear it.
cC says something else and Victoria laughs slightly,
almost against her will. As they walk on, now deep in
conversation:

INT. MARLBORO BLENHEIM HOTEL - DAY

Hillary, as a child, quickly locks back over hex shoulder
as she moves away.

HILLARY
