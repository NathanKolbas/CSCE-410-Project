Title card:

New York City
1961

The card fades out. We hold in black.

Hard cut to a singer accompanying himself on guitar, performing “I’ve Been All Around
This World.” He is Llewyn Davis. He is spotlit, seated on the small stagé’of a New.
York club, maybe The Gaslight.

He finishes the song to applause.

Llewyn
Thank you. You've probably heard that one before, but
what the hell. . .

He rises to go but dips back into the mike:

_.. If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it’s a
folk song.

As the applause abates something, catches Llewyn’s attention:

Nick Porco, the owner of the club, Greenwhich Village Italian, nods Llewyn over. He is
broadly smiling.

Nick
Boy you were some mess last night.

Llewyn
Yeah, sorry, Nick. I’m an asshole.

Nick
Oh I don’t give a shit. I even agree about the music.
Funny to hear you say it though.

Llewyn
Yeah, I’m a funny guy.

Nick
S’very true. Anyways, someone wants to see you out back.
Llewyn
Who?

Nick
Guy in a suit?

A clatter offscreen attracts Llewyns attention:

Backlit in the smoky spotlight someone with a battered guitar is just sit
stool onstage.

BACK ALLEY

The steel door of the club swings open and Llewyn emerges. A thin, an,
than Llewyn, in a suit a size too big is leaning against, the far wall-of th
cigarette. He studies Llewyn for a beat, then, in a Kentucky accent:

Man
You a funny boy, huh?

Llewyn
What?

The man tosses the cigarette away and pushes himself off the wall.

: Man
Had to open ya big mouth, funny boy?

Llewyn

Had to—what? It’s what I do. Fora living. Who’re— |

Man

I’m sorry, what? I’m—oof!
The'man has just socked him in the mouth.

Man
You sit there in the audience last night yellin yer crap?

 
Llewyn is holding his mouth.

Llewyn
Oh for Christ’s sake. You yell stuff, it’s a show.

Man
Ain’t a fuckin fag show!

He hits him again.
... Wasn’t your show!
He hits him again and Llewyn goes down in the slush of the alleyway.

Llewyn
It’s not the opera, jackass!

He kicks. Llewyn curls into a defensive ball and bellows from behind protective
forearms:

Llewyn
It’s a fucking baskethouse!

The man kicks again.
Man
We leavin this fuckin cesspool. You kin have it, smartass.
TRACKING

We are pushing forward at floor-level along a hallway dimly daylit from the room in the
background that it opens into.

Music enters at the cut, an Italian tenor, singing opera. The music has some perspective:
a record-playing in another apartment, perhaps, down an airshaft.

A cat’s feet enter frame and it leads the continuing push in.
The cat enters the background room, camera keeping pace. The cat veers to one side
bringing into frame the bottom of a sofa. The arm of someone above frame asleep on

the couch lolls down onto the floor. We can hear the sleeper’s heavy breathing.

The cat leaps up, leaving frame.
Close on the sleeper: Llewyn Davis, lying on his back. At the sound of

His point of view: the cat stands on his chest staring back, purring with 4 loud rhythmic

tumble.

Llewyn raises a hand to swipe the cat away.

As we hear the cat padding around the room we cut wider on Llewyn. i stirs and rises,

swinging his feet out. He is in his undies.

The walls in this den are decorated with masks and totems and other naf'
civilization art.

Llewyn sits gazing stupidly about for a beat.
He reaches for pants, plops them into his lap.
He look down at the end table just off the sofa arm. On it, some change

Close on him as he looks, then flips the wallet shut and shoves it into another pocket.

DOWN A HALL

We are looking'down the length of a darkish hallway giving onto the brighter den.

Llewyn’s head appears at the far end as he cranes to peer down the hall.
for a still beat.

Llewyn
. .. Hello?

No answer.

He stares out

Llewyn relaxes, enters the hall, walks toward us in his underwear. The cht crosses the

room behind him.

 
LIVING ROOM

Llewyn enters and bends with an oomph to pull his guitar out of a case.

He sits on a sofa, experimenting idly with chords til he finds his way into the continuing
opera. He accompanies it through a couple of chord changes, humming. He loudly
clears phlegm.

KITCHEN

Eggs are cracked into a bowl.

Wider: Llewyn, still undied, whisks the eggs.

Aller a long beat of vigorous whisking he looks about, pulls open a drawer, doesn’t see
what he is after. He looks around, lost, at all the:cabinetry.’.

HALLWAY

Liewyn walks down the hall forking scrambled egg from a plate to his mouth, idly
looking at the pictures on the walls, :

LIVING ROOM AGAIN

Llewyn stands, mouth agape, before a shelf of records, running a finger along the frayed
cardboard spines of the record jackets. The plate of eggs, empty now, sits abandoned on
the hi-fi cabinet next to him.

He lands on a record, pulls it out. He looks at the sleeve with a half-smile, slips out the
LP, puts it on the'hi-fi spindle.

MINUTES LATER

“Dink’s Song” issues from the hi-fi, sung by a harmonizing male duo.

Dressed now, wearing a corduroy sport coat, Llewyin is hunched at a sideboard,
scribbling something onto scratch Paper:

Thanks for the couch. I was a sorry mess last night.
He signs:

While waiting, he pointlessly tries the first apartment door again.

We hear the elevator arriving, a cage door being slid. The outer door is opened by the
attendant.

Llewyn grabs his guitar and steps in.

Hi. . . Could you, could I leave this cat with you?

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

The attendant closes the doors and sets the car in motion.

  

 

Attendant
With me?
Llewyn
Yeah, I, it’s the Gorfeins’ cat. Just til one of them gets
back. oe

Attendant

Llewyn

That’s not a problem, is it? It’s the Gorfeins’.
Attendant
No no. I have to run the elevator.
ADDRESS BOOK

It is being held open: a well-worn address book with sloppy entries faded to different
degrees, some made in pencil, some in ink.

We hear ringing filtered through a phone line.
Wider shows Llewyn standing in a phone booth with the handset wedged between
shoulder and ear and one hand holding the address book and the other hi gging the cat to
his chest.

City traffic rumbles through slush in the background, and people walk by in winter wear
all heavier than Llewyn’s corduroy coat.

The ringing is cut off by a female voice:

Voice
Sociology.

Llewyn
Professor Gorfein, please.

Voice
He’s in a lecture, could I take a message?
B

Llewyn

Yeah, could you tell him, don’t worry, Llewyn has the caf.
Voice

Llewyn is. . . the cat.
Llewyn

Llewyn has the cat. I’m Llewyn. I have his cat.

STREET

“Dink’s Song,” dipped for the preceding dialog, comes back full for this predit
sequence,

An Upper West Side sidewalk subway entrance. The sign is for the A, S E lines.
Llewyn descends, guitar case in one hand, cat hugged to his chest.

TURNSTYLE

Guitar hoisted over it.

 

 
SUBWAY CAR

Llewyn in the middling-crowded train, seated, body jiggling with the motion of the car.
He looks:

A strap-hanging businessman in overcoat and narrow-brimmed fedora holds a folded-
back newspaper, not reading it. He is staring at lightly dressed, cat-hugging Llewyn.

Back to Llewyn. An eye shift.

Two black kids, probably on their way to school, also staring at him.

Back to Llewyn. The cat jumps free.

Llewyn leaps up and crouch-hustles after it. People make way for cat and pursuing man,
giving looks.

WEST 4" STREET

Another sidewalk subway entrance. Llewyn emerges, the recovered cat once again held
to his chest.

VILLAGE STREET

Llewyn walks, guitar in-hand, cat to chest. As the credits end he turns into a tenement
building halfway up the street.

TENEMENT FOYER

Llewyn scans the tenant list and presses the buzzer for BERKEY 6C. No answer. He
presses the button for SUPER IC.

INSIDE

Llewyn is buzzed in. An older Italian man in a wifebeater and blue work pants cinched
high on his midriff cracks open a door at the end of the hall.

Llewyn
Hey Nunzio.
Nunzio
Yeah, they ain’t home though.

Llewyn
It’s okay, I know. Can I use the fire escape?

AIRSHAFT

As Llewyn tops the fire escape stairs on the sixth floor. He sets the cat down on the

metal-slat landing to free a hand and slide up an apartment window., As
cat makes to bolt. Llewyn corrals it, hugs it while he finishes getting th
cases inside.

INSIDE THE BERKEY APARTMENT

Before setting the cat down Llewyn closes the window behind him, then
window next to it, which is cracked open, and closes that.

He sets down the cat.

Small, seedy. Musician photos on the wall suggest the business is musictrelated, Each
posing musician has an arm around the same small stout middle-aged man. Some of the

pictures are autographed, with sentiments to “Mel.”

A pebbled-glass door standing ajar shows an inner office where the short}middle-aged
Mel of the pictures sits behind a desk. His chin rests squarely on the desktop. His

shoulders are slumped down behind the desk. |

 
We see effort in his body as we hear something being dragged along the floor.

Mel relaxes and rolls his castored chair back. He stoops out of the chair and rises
hoisting a filebox he has just pulled from under the desk. He drops it on the desktop and
starts leafing through.

Llewyin is entering.

Llewyn
How we doin?
Mel
We’re doin great!
Llewyn

Really? New record’s doing well?
Mel is instantly sad:
Mel
Oh—how we doin. Notso hot, I gotta be honest.
(projects) Ginny, where's:Cincinatti?

Her voice projects, like his, on the back and forth:

Ginny's Voice
... What?

Mel
Cincinatti. It's not in here.

Ginny’s Voice
It should be in there.

Mel
It’s not in here. I’m tellin ya.

Ginny’s Voice

Mel is still rummaging.

Mel
... Yeah.

Mel

Ginny’s Voice
Yeah. You want it?
Mel

Ginny’s Voice
Should I bring it in?

Mel
Yeah.
Llewyn tries to reclaim the floor:
Llewyn

Do you owe me anything? You have to owe me
something.

I wish.

Ginny enters with a file that Mel examines. She leaves.

Cincinatti is not good.

Ginny’s Voice
That’s it, right?

Mel
(sad)
Yeah, this is it. God help me.

Llewyn
Nobody knew us when we were a duo. It’s not like me and
Mike were ever a big act. It’s not a big reeducation. For
the public. Mel. Mel.

Mel is roused from the file:

Mel
Yeah. Yeah. How ya doin?

Llewyn
Mel, there was no advance: on my solo record, there’s gotta
be some royalty. F shitist’ s sake, it’s cold out I don’t
even have a winter :

  

Mel
Jesus Christ! Ya kiddin me!

He drops the file, shocked.
He rounds the desk and leaves the office.
Llewyn looks around, puzzled.

Through the open door we see a wedge of the outer office. There is a coat rack. Mel’s
hand enters to pluck a coat from it.

The hand disappears and after a moment Mel reenters with the coat.

Mel
Take this, kid.

Llewyn
BUILDING DIRECTORY
A finger enters to buzz BERKEY.
The door buzzes and clicks off its latch.

Llewyn pushes through it.

FIRST FLOOR

Nunzio is leaning out of his apartment door.

Mel—no.
Mel
T insist! I insist!
J
Llewyn
I don’t want your fuckin coat! What’ll you wear?
Mel
Kid—I’Il get by.
Llewyn

It won’t even fit me! This is bullshit, Mel! This is just a
big fat fucking bluff!

Mel
BLUFF! Kid, what, what do you—Bluffl. F offer you

Llewyn
All right. Thanks for the coat. |

Mel

What? All right, wait, shit—Lemme give ya forty dollahg.

 

 

Nunzio

They home.

Llewyn
Yeah.
15

He starts up the stairs.

HIGH LOOKING DOWN

We hear Llewyn panting as we see his hand sliding up the bannister.

APARTMENT DOOR
It is swung open by Jean, a young woman.

Jean
Explain the cat,

Beyond him, in the apartment’s main room, a young man.in’camo fatigues and boots sits
on a rocker, stroking the cat now in his lap. The:young man’s buzz cut shows off a high
forehead.

Llewyn :
It’s the Gorfeins’, Sorry. I crashed there last night—
Young:Man
What's its name? : ~
Llewyn

I don’t know. He snuck out the door when—

Jean
Do you think you’re staying here tonight?

Llewyn
Hoping to. Jim around?
Young Man
It’s a lovely cat.
Jean

Jim’s not here. We told Troy he could crash here.

Young Man
Troy Nelson. How are you?
Llewyn
Yeah, hey. Llewyn Davis.

Troy
Oh—hello! I’ve heard your music—and heard many nice
things about you. From Jim and Jean, and from others.

 

Llewyn
You have not heard one nice thing about me from Jean.
Ever. Have you, Troy.

Jean
You tell the Gorfeins’ you'll take care of their cat, and then
bring him here for us to take care of?

Troy
[ve heard nice things from Jim and Jean. And others.

Llewyn
I didn’t—it just happened—

Troy
Its a peaceful cat. Very contented.

Liewyn |
So I can’t stay here tonight. {

Jean
Look. We told Troy he could stay, We don’t keep the
couch free on the chance you'll show up.

Troy
If this is awkward, I could hitch back to Fort Dix, after I
perform tonight.

Jean
Don’t be silly. We offered you the couch. !

Llewyn
You’re gigging somewhere?

Jean
Troy is playing at the Commons tonight. We’re meeting
Jim there.

 
17
Troy
Well, I could sleep on the floor, here. Llewyn could have
the couch. I’m certainly not a man of comforts.
Alternately—I could hitch back to Fort Dix after the show.

Jean scribbles furiously on a page of a spiral notebook. As she rips the page out and
hands it to Llewyn:

Jean
Llewyn can sleep on the floor. With his cat.

Llewyn
It’s the Gorfeins’ cat.

He looks at the paper:
I'm pregnant.

He looks up at Jean.

... What the fuck!

 

THE COMMONS
Onstage, now wearing slacks and sweater, Troy performs “The Last Thing on my Mind.”

In the audience, Llewyn sits near Jean, one empty seat between, both of them gazing up
at the performance.

Hands enter from behind Llewyn to grab his shoulders and squeeze. The person—a
young man—drops into the empty seat.
Jim
Hey Llewyn! Good to see you, man!

Llewyn
Hey.
Llewyn smiles and is immediately uncertain whether to look as Jim lears away to give

Jean a kiss.
Jim looks up at the performance.

At length, sotto voce, eyes still directed up at the stage:

Llewyn
. .. What do you think?
Jim
(also looking up)
What.
Llewyn
Him. Troy.
Jim shakes his head admiringly.
Jim
Wonderful performer.
Llewyn
Is he?
Jim
Wonderful.
Llewyn

Does he have. . . higher function?

Voice
Sshh!

Llewyn looks around for the shusher, then leans in closer to Jim.
Llewyn
Look Jim, I didn’t want to mention this in front of Jean,

you know how she gets.

Jim
What do you mean?

Llewyn

 

 

18
19
You know, just—I need a little money. I can pay you back soon. That,
and the last loan. There’s a girl I know who’s in trouble.
Needs to get fixed.

Jim
Not again.

The song is ending. Healthy applause; Llewyin leans in closer.

Onstage:

Llewyn
Different girl. Don’t tell Jean.

Jim
I can’t get it without Jean knowing. It’s okay, she’ll be
okay with it.

Llewyn
No no no, that’s okay, I, uh, I cai find it somewhere else.

Troy
Thank you very much. Thank you. There’s someone
special in the audience tonight, who'll maybe get up and
help me out here if you give a round of applause. . .

 

Llewyn rolls his eyes.

Llewyn
I don’t have my guitar.

Troy
I know that you folks know’m and love’m, ladies and
gentlemen—Jim and Jean!

Llewyn
Uh. Yeah.

He applauds with the crowd as Jim and Jean take the stage.

Three guitars and three voices: they perform “Early Morning Rain.”

Jean swivels at the mike she shares with Jim, giving the crowd eye contact. When her
look crosses Llewyn it darkens.
He gives her a what-did-I-do.
Her look moves on.

Nick Porco plops himself into the empty chair next to Llewyn.

Nick
Boy they’re not bad.
Llewyn
Uh-huh.
Staring beat. Then:
Nick

That Jean, I'd like to fuck her. i

Llewyn

. Yeah. T guess.

APARTMENT |
Night. Light snoring.
The cat walks past a large shape on the floor—Troy Nelson—and leaps up out of frame.

|

Llewyn’s light snoring stops in a grunt of surprise as the cat lands on hisichest.
‘

He and the purring cat look at each other. i

MORNING i

The clinking of a spoon.

 

Llewyn stirs, looks around.

Troy Nelson sits in a low rocker, knees sticking up, once again in his fatigues and boots,

spooning cereal from a bowl.

Troy

Sorry. Early. Tried not to wake anyone.
21

Llewyn
S’okay.
Troy
Morning mess.
Llewyn

Uh-huh.
Another clink; the crunch of corn flakes between teeth.
And another.

Troy sets his spoon down and looks at the bowl for a beat. Then-he raises. it with both
hands and drains the milk from it. He clears his throati

Troy
Well. That was very good.

Llewyn, resting on his side, props his head on a fist and stares.

Llewyn
Well, . .What's next?
Troy
Whaddya mean?.
Llewyn
Do you. . . plug yourself in somewhere?
Troy blinks at him.
Troy
No.

His look holds for a beat, then wanders around the apartment. When it reaches Llewyn
again he sighs, then slaps his belly.

Well. Report for duty. Back to Fort Dix.

it’s part of the job.

Llewyn

toys.
Llewyn
Is it a career? 1

Troy j

No, no. I get out in a few months. Bud Grossman has
expressed interest in representing me.

This gets Llewyn’s attention.

Llewyn
Bud Grossman. What’s he like?

Troy
Mr. Grossman is a: wonderful man. He’s been very !
supportive, I played at his club in Chicago on my last |
furlough, right after I got back from Germany.

 

Llewyn swings his feet out and puts his pants on.

Llewyn
You meet Elvis?

Troy
No. Everyone asks that. I did not meet Private Presley.

He has finished packing. Llewyn puts a cigarette in his mouth and pats himself down for

Llewyn

So you played at the Gate of Horn.

Troy
Yes. Mr. Grossman liked what he saw, I guess. He thinks I
can have a career.

Llewyn
Uh-huh.

He pushes the window open a foot and reclines on the couch head-towards-window, to
smoke.

‘Troy pauses with his kit at the door. Near the bedroom, he keeps his voice low:

... Thank Jim and Jean for me. Don’t want to wake them.

Llewyn
Will do.
Troy
Good meeting you.
Llewyn

You too.
Troy goes through the door and eases it shut behind him.

Llewyn draws on the cigarette, angles the exhale towards the window, then looks back
into the room,

The cat walks toward him, tail up, purring.

Llewyn
What’s your name, again?

The cat Jeaps onto the sill and is out the window.
... Fuck!

He lunges for it, sticking an arm through the window over the fire escape—but is not
even close.

He sticks his head out the window.
24
His point-of-view down: the cat pat-pat-pats away down the fire escape| toward the
alley below, each step on the metal stairs giving the faintest clung.

Fuck! Llewyn

He draws his head back in, banging the back of it on the window sash, and bolts for the
apartment door and through it, letting it close behind him with a SLAM
STAIRWAY

He passes a surprised Troy Nelson one flight down.

Llewyn
Cat!

Llewyn bangs out the front door and sprints several feet to the alley mouth and into the

Jean
I don’t know!

Llewyn
You don’t know if it’s mine.

Jean
No! How would I know?

Llewyn
So it could be Jim’s.

Jean
Yes! Asshole!

Llewyn
But you don’t want it either way. To be clear.

Jean
To be clear, asshole, you fucking asshole, | want very
much to have it if it’s Jim’s. That’s what I want. But since
I don’t know, you not only fucked things up by fucking the

Jean
You’re joking.
Llewyn

Not for me, it’s for the Gorfeins. Their cat got out—could
you leave the fire escape window open?

She stares at him.

Jean
It’s winter.

Llewyn
Just enough for the cat? To squeeze back in? It could
come back.
Jean

Come back? To our apartment? It was there like six hours!

Why would it come back there?
For the first time in the conversation Llewyn is exercised.
Llewyn
I don’t know, I’m not a fucking cat! Think about it, I lo:

That's what you feel bad about?

of the car.

Long hold.

The window pops into brightness:as the train emerges onto a bridge-approach, giving us

a brief view down the East River.

QUEENS STREET

Llewyn is a small figure receding down a quiet residential street.

STOOP
Llewyn sits on a stoop reading a newspaper, elbows on knees.

Ata sound, he looks up.

A woman a little older than him is coming up the walk with a bag of groceries. She is

surprised to see him.

Woman \
(leaving) |

He looks idly around.

Working-class kitchen. Oilcloth on the table. Some seafaring knickknadks.

Projected, from off:

Woman
I cleaned it out, the house. There was some stuff. I put ya

stuff in a box. . i

32
33
She reenters with an open box.

... What I thought ya might want.

She sets it on the table in front of him. He looks with no particular interest, flips through
a couple of things, shrugs.

Llewyn
I don’t know, Joy, just, what would I. . . just stick it out at
the curb.

Woman
Llewyn! Are you kiddin? Lookit this. You know what
this is? :

She is pulling out an EP-sized record ina plain white sleeve.

.-. This is when you recorded “Ladies of Spain” for Mom
and Dad!

He looks at her, shrugs a so-what.

... You're whateva, you're like cight years old! It’s so
cute!

Llewyn
Well, see, Joy, in.the entertainment business you’re never
supposed to let your practice shit out. Ruins the mystique.

She is disappointed that he won’t share her enthusiasm.

Joy
I’m sorry, I don’t know a lot about the entertainment
business.
Llewyn

Yeah. Well. Don’t be sorry.

SUBWAY PLATFORM

No, he.said it’s urgent.; A session this afternoon at RCA, | i
somebody got sick, dropped out—he thought you’d like the
work— \
i
Llewyn projects over the roar of an approaching train which, from our pérspective, buries
the voice at the:other end. i

Llewyn :
What? WHAT? Do I need my guitar?. .. DID HE SAY |

DOI NEED MY GUITAR?. .. NO?—

The approaching train roars into frame.

SWANK DOUBLE-DOORS

The RCA logo adorns the large reception desk inside.
35
Llewyn bangs through the doors.
INSIDE
He goes up to the receptionist:

Llewyn
I’m here for Mr. Cromartie’s session? Llewyn Davis?

Receptionist

Have a seat, I’ll let him know you’re here.
SEATING AREA
Minutes later.
Liewyn sits waiting, on furniture more expensive than he is used to.
Very, very quiet.
He looks around.
Gold records on the wall, tastefully framed.

Black-and white photographs, nicely lit, of performers, in the studio. Different genres
are represented—Dizzy Gillespie; Johnny Matthis, a young Leonard Bernstein.

The muted click of a door latch draws Llewyn’s attention.

Ambling down the hall, hands dug into pockets, is a distinguished, Waspy gentleman in
tweeds. Llewyn jumps to his feet.

Cromartie
Llewyn?

Llewyn
Mr. Cromartie, an honor to meet you.

Cromartie
Where’s your guitar?

Jim
You’ll play a Gibson, right?

A nice but not especially large studio. Jim is walking Llewyn in, beams arm around

Llewyn

Yours? Sure. You’re playing— |

Jim j

The D-15. You know Al? |

i

Another young man, with guitar, is at one of the three stools ranged around a
microphone. }

Llewyn
Hey man.

Voice through the talk-back:

Voice
Read a chart, Llewyn?

It is Cromartie who, in the control:‘toom, stands behind the board.

Llewyn
I... 1... can stare at a chart and fake it, sir. '
Mutely, behind the glass, Cromartie laughs. We get the tail of the laugh as he punches
in:
i

Cromartie
Jim and Al will teach it to you. Take your time. We’re
here to have fun.

Llewyn
Okay. (to Jim) So... we’re the, the what? The John
Glenn Singers?

He looks up.

His point-of-view: a high ceiling. Hanging sound reflectors of blond wood.
37

Cromartie’s Voice
It’s not the most serious music we’ ve recorded here.

Jim
(explanatory)
It’s a thing.
MANY MINUTES LATER
The three men are setting themselves at the microphone.

Llewyn
So I'm going down on “capsule,” I’m doing this... .

He demonstrates on guitar.

Al
Yeah, I'm taking the high. . .

They run through a couple of phrases, voice and guitar, not full volume.

Llewyn

Okay. Okay. (low) I’m happy for the gig, but... who

wrote this?
Jim looks uncomfortable.

Jim
I did.
Cromartie
(through talk back)
Okay?

Some last minute arranging of weight on stools. Throat clears.
Jim
So, okay.

Cromartie
Good?
38
Al
Okay.

Cromartie
One second.

Waiting beat.

Muted back-and-forth in the control room between Cromartie and the erigineer.
Cromartie laughs silently. Engineer, smiling, nods. Engineeer checks spmething.
Cromartie gets serious, leans forward for the talk-back button:

|
Cromartie |

Okay. . . “Please Mr. Kennedy” take one. Sound of a blabt-
off and. . . we're rolling. i

Al and Llewyn look to Jim who nods in time, whispering a count-off:

Jim

. two three four...

And they perform the song.

CORNER OF THE STUDIO

Some time later. 1

Llewyn sits on a folding chair, one of several along one wall, near atable on which sit a
coffee percolator and some cups and other paraphernalia. Mike stands ae ranged nearby.

Jim and Al are-shrugging into coats. Another man, in shirtlseeves and td stands over
Llewyn who has a pen.and a clipboard holding papers. As he squints at the top sheet,
Llewyn addresses:Jim: \

Llewyn i
No, thank you, I appreciate it. I needed this. As you know.
Jim
Don’t thank me, thank Richie Sheridan. Puked his way out
of the John Glenn Singers.

Llewyn
Tough ruck. We’ll be touring, right?
39

Al laughs.
Al
Touring my ass.
Llewyn
Pll get my vaccinations. (to shirtsleeved man as he
continues to squint at papers) Where?
Man
You are AF of M right?
Llewyn
Yeah.
Man
Sign there and there. You don’t have a label?
Llewyn
1 do—Legacy.
Man
You're exclusive to Mel? [’ll need a permission. He’ll
give you one.
Llewyn
But it'll take, shit... [ need the money now.
The man shrugs:

Man
You wanna just be an independent contractor, accounting’ lI
give 'you a check today. Bill us for services, $200. It’s
more than the session fee ’cause you don’t get royalties.

Llewyn
Okay. And I can cash it?

Man
Sure, right around the corner. But you don’t go on the
session sheet then.

Llewyn
That’s fine. That’s okay. . .
As he signs:

. .. Where do you live, Al?

Al
Downing Street.
Llewyn
Nice place?
Al
Dump.
Llewyn

Uh-huh. Got a couch?

LEGACY RECORDS

The seedy office where carlier we met'Mel Novikoff.

i
We hear the clack of a typewriter as.we pushin. Now, though, the insid¢ doorway to

Mel’s office stands ajar, exposing desk’ and émpty chair and late sun.
Llewyn looks over at-Ginny, typing something.

Llewyn
Where’s.Mel?

Ginny, eyes om her work, replies absently while still typing:

Ginny
Mel, is at. . . a funeral.

Llewyn
Boy, that man goes to a lot of funerals.

Ginny
He likes people.

Llewyn
Fewer and fewer!

\

4)
She continues typing.
Ginny
This is family. His nephew Georgie is engaged to a girl

whose mother just passed.

Llewyn
I... don’t know if that’s family.

Ginny’s eyes remain on her work.

Ginny

He likes funerals, I don’t know what to tell you:
Llewyn

I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday. So pissed at Mel.
Ginny

Ya didn’t forget to pick up your mail.
Licwyn

Yes I did.
Ginny

You don’t have any mail.
Llewyn

Oh. (beat) Shit. Nothing? (she types on; he is hesitant) .
.. I didn’t get anything from Bud Grossman? In Chicago?

Ginny
You were supposed to get something from Bud Grossman?
Llewyn
IT had Me! send him my solo record. When it came out.
Whenever, more than a month ago.

Ginny
Oh!

She stops typing and rises, giving Llewyn momentary hope.

... No, you didn’t get anything, but we were making space
42
in the stock room and dumped the rest of the old record. | All the
remainduhs. Yours and Mikey’s. . .

She hoists a box from behind the counter.

. Mel set one box aside, thought you might want to keg
some copies.

Llewyn pulls a copy from the box, shaking his head, and looks at the cover.

The artists are Timlin and Davis, Llewyn himself recognizable though clean-shaven,
looking only a little younger, on a stool with a guitar, mouth frozen midtsong. Standing
behind him is, presumably, Mike Timlin, transported by the music, joyously vocalizing
to the heavens with his body tensed and his hands turned up. The namejof: the record is,
“If We Had Wings!”

Llewyn
Whuh. .. 1... (shrugs) What'm I gonna do with ’em?

Ginny resumes typing.

Ginny
Should I throw ’em out? ;

HALLWAY |
4
The dingy hallway of the office’s. building. “Dink’s Song” plays.

Llewyn has the box at the elevator and presses it with his body against the wall in order
to free one hand and hit the call button. :

!

|
STREETS

The song, continues to play as Llewyn walks down slushy Village streets sweating, the
box held awkwardly out before his stomach. :

VESTIBULE }

The box is body-pressed against the vestibule wall and Llewyn’s freed hand goes to the
directory. It finds CODY, 6A, and buzzes.
43
STAIRWELL
We are looking down six flights’ worth of stairwell. We catch glimpses of Llewyn
ascending, midway up, some of his shoulder and his arm pressing box to stomach
swinging into view with each laborious footfall.
SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

A spent Llewyn drops the box to the floor and leans against the door jamb of 6A and
knocks, panting. ue ae

We jump in as Al, from the recording session, opens the door.

Al
Good, here’s the key. I’m Tunning out to Jersey to pick up
my mother’s car. :

Llewyn
(heavy panting)
Okay.
INSIDE THE APARTMENT

Llewyn looks around the small studio, hands on hips.

He sits and bounces, experimentally on the couch: how’s this one? He swings his legs up
and lies back:ta:see iftit affords'full extension. Pretty close.

He rises, and beiids down to shove his record box under Al’s couch. It won’t go under all
the way; something is ‘blocking.

Llewyn peeks, reaches under, pulls out an uncovered box similar to his, packed with
LP’s.

He pulls one out showing that the box Contains copies of one record. Its title: Another
Point of View. The artist: Al Cody. The cover photograph of Al, whom we've only seen
happy, has him looking rather pensive.

 

Llewyn gazes at the album.

CAFE REGGIO

Jean sits into close shot. We are in a dark Italian coffee shop.

Jean
Who won the lottery tonight?

Llewyn
Huh? Oh, I’m staying at Al Cody’s. So. When do you
want to do this thing?

Jean
The abortion? The sooner the better. Tomorrow if I can.
Jim won’t be around, I won’t have to make up a story

44
45
where I’m going.

Llewyn
Okay, I'll see if the guy can do it then.

Jean
The guy? ! hope he’s a doctor.

Llewyn
Yeah yeah, he’s a doctor,
Jean
You got the money?
Llewyn
Yeah, | got the money—don’t worry.
Jean
With you I worry.
Llewyn
Well you shouldn’t.
Jean

Yes I should. God knows you never do. You just let other
people. Like your method of birth control.

Llewyn
Please don’t start with the double-condoms again.

Jean
Do you ever think about the future at all?

Llewyn
The future? You mean like, flying cars? Hotels on the
moon? Tang?

Jean
And this is why you’re fucked.

Llewyn
No, it’s why you’re fucked. Trying to blueprint a future.
Move to the suburbs. With Jim. Have kids.

Jean ;

That’s bad?

Llewyn |

If that’s what music is, for you, a way to get to that placd,

then yes—it’s a little careerist. A little square. Anda little
sad. |

Jean
I'm sad! You’re the one who’s not getting anywhere! Ybu
don’t even want to get anywhere! Me and Jim try!

Llewyn gropes: |

Llewyn
I do wanna. . . | wanna— i

Jean
We try! You sleep on the couch!

Llewyn
Bad thing to throw in my face, man!

 

You don’t wanna go‘ariy whe ind that’s why all the same
shit is going to keep-happening to you. Because you. want
it to. 4

Llewyn .
Is that'why. )

Jean
And also because—you’re an asshole! Let’s not forget
that! Who sleeps with other people’s women!

Llewyn 4
Well you're being pretty kind to yourself now, aren’t you!

Jean
Who’s couch are you on tonight?

Llewyn i
I told you, Al Cody’s.

46
47
He is tensing, rising, looking out the window.

... You don’t listen, you just, spout vitriol. . .
Jean looks at him, puzzled by the trance he has entered, His eyes widen further.
. .. Keep an eye on my shit!

He bolts.

OUTSIDE
Llewyn pounds down the sidewalk, missing most—but bumping some—of ‘the
pedestrians.

Llewyn
HEY!

A couple of people glance around; none of them are his focus. He pourids along.
... HEY!
As he nears the object of his pursuit his syeline drops.
... Hey! Hey! Hey!
He is hastily crouch-walking now and he reaches forward and scoops—
The Gorfeins’ cat, which twists and struggles, but only a little, as Llewyn tucks him
against his chest.
BACK IN THE COFFEESHOP
Llewyn enters with the cat.
Llewyn
God damn. | am one lucky bastard. Thank you for

suggesting this place.

He glances furtively around, then takes his coffee cup off its saucer and pours cream into
it from the silver creamer. He sets the cat on the table to feed.
| 48
... Thing can’t have eaten since yesterday, it’s a damn Te

Jean watches the cat lap milk. Llewyn pets it and it pushes back agains{ his hand, purring
as it continues to lap milk.
|
... Do you know his name? I can’t remember its name. i

Jean
I don’t know its name. I barely know the Gorfeins.

Llewyn ;
Jesus. Thank God. Good kitty. Well—where were we?!

 

All the acrimony is spent. The exchange is matter-of-fact:

Jean {

You were calling me a careerist. And I was calling you @

loser, :
Llewyn

Right. Well. Those are your categories.

Jean
No—those are your, categories.

Llewyn
Ya know, in my:experience the world is divided into two
kinds:of people: Those who divide the world into two
categories—

Jean
—and losers?

FOLLOWING THE CAT

We follow at floor level as the cat pads through Al Cody’s apartment. When it reaches a
table leg it leaps up out of frame.

We cut up as it lands on the table. It pads onto a pile of mail, starting to disarrange it,
until Llewyn hooks its belly with one hand and dumps it back on the floor.

Llewyn
Not your house.
   

49

He nudges the mail back into a pile as the apartment door opens and Al enters, shucking
his coat. Llewyn’s look has caught on the mail.

Llewyn
Who’s Arthur Milgram?

Al
That’s me. Gonna change it legally. At some point.
What’s up with the cat?

Llewyn
It’s not staying, I’m bringing him back to—long story.
Taking him home to the Gorfeins’ tonight.

Al
Okay. No, that’s fine. But, uh... Llewyn, tonight and
tomorrow is good here, but then my girlfriénd’s coming
down from Boston.

Licwyn
Okay okay, thanks for the two days.
Al
You don’t want to go to Chicago do you?
Llewyn
Why the fuck would I want to go to Chicago.
Al
Right.
Llewyn
Why do you ask?
Al

I’m loaning my mother’s car to a friend who does stuff for
Roland Turner. You know Roland Turner? (Llewyn
shrugs ignorance) Old timer. Jazz guy. He won’t fly.
They’re driving out to Chicago for a gig, looking for
someone to help pay for gas.

Llewyn
No reason for me to go to Chicago. But—thanks—I’Il find

INNER OFFICE !
Llewyn is now seated across a desk from the doctor, Gary Ruvkun.
Llewyn is shaking his head.

Gary
Okay, well, she should have a friend though, someone who

Llewyn
Okay, I’II tell her.

Gary

SUBWAY CAR

Llewyn sits in the middling-crowded car, cat hugged to his chest, staring vacantly down,
mentally chewing, body moving with the motion of the car. At length hé shrugs away his
thought, whatever it was, and his look drifts.

It catches on something.

A straphanging businessman is looking at him. Is it the same one he sa going
downtown from the Gorfeins’?

INSIDE AN ELEVATOR |

The same operator is holding the throttle down in the Gorfeins’ élevator poking
suspiciously behind him as the floors slip by outside the gate. Llewyn‘is ' standing at the
back of the cab holding the cat securely against his chest, We hear a fist tapping.

THE GORFEINS’ DOOR

As it swings open to reveal a short bespectacled middle-aged man ina cardigan.

Mitch
There's the cat!

 

It spills out of Licwyn’s arms and runs into the apartment. Mitch hugs Llewyn.

++» Home from the hill! Llewyn, welcome! Come on in,
Lillian is in the kitchen making her famous moussakal!

Llewyn
Oh, that’s okay, I can’t barge in for dinner, I just wanted
to—
Mitch pulls him into the apartment.
Mitch

No, what’re you talking about, one more person—
moussaka?! C’mon. .. Do you know Marty Green and
Janet Fung?

A Jewish-looking man and a Chinese woman nod and smile greeting.

Llewyn’s not an Upper West Side guy. We only get to see
him when he’s. . . i
{
Llewyn ;
When I've rotated through my Village friends,

Mitch :
We're the last resort. Marty is in my department—and Joe
is a musician, this is Joe Flom, he plays in Musica Anticha
with Lillian.

Llewyn
Hey, how ya doing.
Joe
Nice to meet you.
Llewyn

What’s your instrument?

Joe
Well anything with a keyboard, I play celeste and
harpsichord in MA. I’m a piano instructor most days.

Llewyn
Bum a cigarette?

Joe
Sure.

Mitch

54
55
Glass of wine, Llewyn? Little dago red?

Llewyn
Sure, I uh, I should’ve brought something.

Mitch
Don’t be silly, you brought the cat.

Llewyn
I took piano lessons when I was a kid, from Mrs.
Sieglestein. You don’t know Mrs. Sieglestein do ya? Very
big calves, orthopedic shoes? Lives in Far Rockaway?
Upstairs from the Kurlands?

Joe
Does she play Early Music?

Llewyn.
Harry James, on the radio. On piano she played mostly,
what, we played, uh, Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes.
I don’t know. Sounded early.

Joe
Uh-huh.
Llewyn
She was not a swinger.
Joe
Well—Harry James.
Llewyn
Well, okay. Her playing though, pretty on the beat.
Joe
You still play piano?
Llewyn

I'll sit down and fiddle with anything, but not really. Not
so’s it sounds pretty.

Joe
Well, pretty is overrated.
56
Llewyn
Yeah, I agree. That’s why I sing. I’m kind of a shouter.

Mitch
What did Anton say? When Llewyn takes a solo. . .

BABY PICTURE

Insert on a picture of a strange looking two-year-old, half Asian, half seething else.

At the cut the clink-clank of a dinner table, and Llewyn’s voice: {

Llewyn
He's. .. he’s adorable. How old is he?

Wider on the dinner table as he hands the picture back to Janet Fung.

Janet
Turned two in April. He’s,With my mother now.

 

Marty
Grandmas come in handy.
Llewyn
What’s:his name?
Marty
Howie.
Janet

He already calls him Howie. Howard.

Marty

What, like, Green, Fung? Hyphenated?

Marty
Leaping in:

Mitch rises.

57
No no, one word. Greenfung.

Janet

Llewyn
You’re—kidding, right?

Janet
(puzzled; ready to take offense)

Mitch
Why don’t you give us a song, Llewyn?
Llewyn
Oh—no, I—
Lillian

Oh, please—he’s very good. Joe should hear you.

Mitch
And Marty and Janet:

Lillian
Well of course Marty and Janet.

Llewyn

No, they don’t need to sit through—

Mitch
I’m getting my Kalamazoo. You get to play it if and only
if you sing.

Llewyn
Okay, yeah, I can tell, this is one of those things, I keep
saying no you think I’m just asking you to beg more.

Lillian
That’s right.
Llewyn
You know, I’m not a trained poodle.

Mitch reenters with guitar case.

Mitch
Not even housebroken.

Llewyn
Yeah yeah, okay. Boy. Nice instrument.

He takes it, runs a couple of licks.

... This is, this one’s pretty early, Joe should like it.

Receptive chuckles from the little audience.
Llewyn starts playing, and singing, “Dink’s Song.”

The small group listens, genuinely taken with the performanc.

As Llewyn begins the second verse, Lillian Gorfein cases in a high, sweet harmony.

Llewyn stops playing.
~~ Llewyn
s (sharply)
What-are you doing.

The spell is broken. The little audience is puzzled. Lillian is lost.

Lillian
... What?

Llewyn
What is that? What’re you doing?

Lillian
I—

Llewyn

Don’t do that.

Llewyn
I know what it is. Don’t do that. You know what?

He is more and more testy as he opens the guitar case and lays the guitar inside.

... This is bullshit. I don’t do this. I do this for a living,
you know? I’ma musician. [ sing for a living. It’s not a
parlor game.

Mitch
Llewyn, please—that’s unfair to Lillian—

Llewyn
This is bullshit. I don’t ask you over for dinner and then
suggest you give us a lecture on the peoples of Meso-
America or whatever your pre-columbian shiftis, This is
my job. This is how I pay the fucking rent.

Lillian rises. She is choking up.

Lillian
Llewyn, that’s not, this is not—this is a loving home!
Llewyn
I’m a fucking professional. And you know what, fuck
Mike's part.
Lillian
This is terrible. This is dreadful.
Mitch
It’s okay Lillian.
Lillian

I’m going—I’m going—I do not want to be in this room.
She leaves, weeping.
Llewyn

Well she doesn’t have to leave. I’m leaving. Obviously.
Thank you for the moussaka. I’m sorry if I fucked up your
evening.

 

Walla of protestation, calls for calm, from Mitch, Joe, Marty Green—cut short by a
scream.

Everyone freezes, looking to where Lillian exited.
A still beat.
Lillian rushes in, holding the cat up, face-out, by its front paws.

Lillian
This is not our cat!

A staring beat. Mitch’s mouth hangs open.

BLACK

FADE IN

A point-of-view through a windshield, moving down a Village street. Slushy, grey, early
morning. A figure is waiting at the curb, guitar case and small bag at his feet, holding a
cat to his chest.

Cut outside as we pull up.

The car is a big four-door. The driver is an all-American young'man, good-looking
although something not quite right about his face makes him less than d matinee idol. His
blond hair is combed back in a pompadour. The stub of a'cigarétte hangs:from his lip.

Llewyn looks in the back seat. A large man ina fedorais very still inside, either asleep
or passed out. Next to him are two canes with silver animal knobs:

The pompadoured driver, though he has stapped for Llewyn, seems to be ignoring him.
Llewyn holds up his guitar case.

Llewyn
Trunk?

Driver
Tt’s full.

He jerks his thumb toward the back seat.

Llewyn operis the back door and stows the case upright, carefull not to disturb the—
sleeping?—fat'man. He has a goatee and sunglasses. He has a feather in his broad-
brimmed fedora and an animal fetish tie pin. His french cuffs are secured with bangles.
Llewyn gingerly shuts the door and climbs in front.

The driver puts the car in gear and starts driving.

Llewyn, somewhat bewildered, looks at the wordless driver—white t-shirt, leather
jacket—staring out at the road. Llewyn looks back at the big man in the back seat, whose
body now joggles with the motion of the car.

Llewyn turns back to the driver.
Llewyn
Hello.
The driver’s eyes stay on the road.
Driver
Yeah, heya.
COUNTRYSIDE

Some time later.

Llewyn is vacant, nodding, looking out.

Elaborate gagging and wake-snarfling noises from the.Wack seat drdw hb attention.

The man in back stirs, smacks his lips, looks around.

He sees the guitar case,

Driving beat.

Roland Turner
What's this.

Liewyn
My guitar,

Roland Turner

Sure; move in, make yourself at home, don’t mind me.

Roland Turner
I'm Roland Turner. This is my valet, Johnny Five.

63

Llewyn looks at Johnny Five.

Johnny Five is still unemotively focused on the road. The butt still burns on his lower
lip, though it seems to be the same length.

Llewyn looks back at Roland Turner.

Llewyn
Yeah, we met. I think.

ANOTHER TIME CUT
Roland Turner is fully awake and has a lot to say.

Roland Turner
And that was the last time I was.in Murfreesboro. Gave me
to understand I would not be welpomed back. I said, that’s
okay, brother, I might have managed on my own not to
make it back to your little flyspeck horseshit town. What's
the N stand for?

Llewyn
... What? :

Roland Turner
What's the N stand for? Lou N. Davis?

Llewyn
Llewyn. Llewyn. L-L-E-W-Y-N. It’s Welsh.

Roland Turner
Well it would have to be something, stupid fuckin name
like that. Here, this would interest you, Johnny and I were
in Seatttle, playing The High Spot—remember this,
Johnny?—and I became indisposed after eating a toasted
cheese sandwich. May well have been a rancid slice of
bacon. Found myself purging from every orifice—one of
them like a firehose—I said to the manager, What do you
call that thing I just ate? He said “Welsh rarebit.” | said
okay, does everything from Wales make you shit yourself
or just this piece of toast. He said, and I’ll never forget it
because it almost made the experience worthwhile, he said
64
Mr. Turner—Holy Jesus what is that thing?

He has seen the cat, peeking over Llewyn’s shoulder.

Llewyn
My cat. Well not my cat, it’s uh. . .

Roland Turner
Grown man with a cat? Is it part of your act?

Llewyn
No.

Outside.the window something attracts his attention.

Johnny, hold up, there’s a Sinclair station. Your turn to
pay for gas, Elwyn.

GAS STATION LOT i
65
In the foreground Llewyn, back to us, leans against the car. Receding across the lot
toward the station in the background is Roland Tumer, elegantly dressed, herky-jerking
away with his two canes.
MINUTES LATER

Llewyn comes out of the gas station office with a soda.

Johnny Five is leaning against the building, one knee bent and foot planted against the
brick. His thumbs are hooked in his pockets.

Llewyn looks at the empty car, looks at Johnny Five.

Llewyn
He still in there?
Johnny Five
Yup.
MINUTES LATER

Llewyn is leaned back in the front. passenget:seat, its door open. His eyes are closed.
The sound of a distant door.

He looks out: Roland Turner is rounding the corner of the building, herky-jerking
towards the car, slower than on his walk in,

Johnny Five‘unperches from the building and goes to help.

CAR

Traveling. Minutes later.

Quiet. Llewyn looks back.

Roland Turner is in the back seat, eyes closed again. A trace of drool.
Johnny Five drives, smoking cigarette on his lip.

Llewyn
 

67
Llewyn
Couldn’t tell you.

Roland Turner
Clay. But! Not just any fucking clay, Belgian clay. They
have this clay—what did you say your name was?

Llewyn
Llewyn.

Roland Turner
That’s right. They have this clay, only place in the world
they can find it, just outside of Bruges. Harder than my ae
dick if it’s fired properly. Throw it against a wall. Many
times as you want, go ahead, Elwyn, you.ain’t gonna break
those little bastards. No massé shots, no coinsion cloth:
My ass. Girl scout rules, Like music: you play like you
play. Well you don’t. But in jazz, you know, we play all
the notes. Twelve notes ina scale, dipshit. Not three
chords on a ukelele.

An assaultive drone:

Beat.

  

Geeee. ... Geeee.... Ce . Geee, .. Ceeee. .. Deee. .
.. Gee. Jesus Fucking’ Well, if you make a living
at it more power to'you. Solo act?

Llewyn
Yeah, Now,

; Roland Turner
& Now? Used to, what, work with the cat? Every time you
played'aC major it’d puke a hairball?

  

4 Llewyn
I used to have a partner.

Roland Turner
What happened?

Llewyn
He threw himself off the George Washington Bridge.
Roland Turner
Well shit, I don’t blame him, I couldn’t take it either
having to play Jimmie Crack Corn every night. Although,
pardon me for saying so, but that’s pretty fucking stupid
isn’t it? George Washington Bridge? You throw yourself
off the Brooklyn Bridge. Traditionally. George
Washington Bridge, who does that? What was he, a
dumbbell?

Llewyn
Not really.

Roland Turner
And that’s when you picked up the cat? Thank God I never
had to resort to gimmicks. People pay. to sec Roland’
Turner. Playing what he plays, going where-he goes.
Exploring. It’s the freedom theyre’ paying’to, see. .They
don’t wanna see some jackass playing.a.song they’ve heatd
eighteen hundred times before. Though if you make a
living at it more power to you.

 

The cane whacks Llewyn’s shoulder again.

understanding, from Chano Pozzo in New Orleans. You say you'll
mess me up? I don’t have to make those childish threats, I
just do my thing. I do my thing and one day you wake up
wondering why do I have this pain in my side? I stretch
and I eat right and I take warm baths but it just won’t go
away, this pain, why is that? Or maybe it won’t even be
that specific, depends, maybe it’s just Why is nothing
going right for me? Doesn’t matter what I do, it just won’t
come out, I just can’t make anything come out right. My
life is a big bowl of shit. I don’t remember making this big,
bowl of shit. And meantime, Roland Turner is somewhere
a thousand miles away laughing his ass off. Thats what

happens.

A beat.
Think about that, Elwyn. In this car, bad: manners won’t
work. Your turn to pay for gas.

GAS STATION

Roland Turner is herky-jerking away into the background,

Johnny Five is once again in the.driver’s séat, Llewyn in the Passenger seat. Llewyn’s
look shifts from the receding jazzman to Johnny Five.

Llewyn
Bum a cigarette?

Johnny Five
I’m out.

Roland Turner recedes: clack-clack.. . clack-clack. . .

Tire chirp as the car pulls out of the station.

Llewyn
How come?
73

He hoists himself with a grunt and clacks away across the nearly deserted restaurant.

LLEWYN AT THE REGISTER
The cash register’s ring-open hits the cut.
A waitress takes Llewyn’s cash and makes change.

Llewyn
How far are we from Chicago?

Waitress
Three hours. A little more, this weather.
TABLE
Johnny Five sits alone, elbow on table and hand. up;extended thumb propped against his
temple and burning cigarette wedged between two fingers. He stares with a quizzical
expression at the book he once again reads. His mouth hangs open.

Llewyn is arriving back at the table. He drops some change on the tabletop.

Johnny Five
Ha ha-ha ha hat

With his eyes still onthe book, Johnny Five’s mirth mellows into a smile. The smile
slowly fades. His mouth once.again hangs open as he reads on.

Llewyn looks at the empty throw of restaurant.

MEN’S ROOM
Llewyn enters.

A clean, empty, fairly high-ceilinged bathroom with a long row of urinals and a long row
of stalls.

Roland Turner’s legs are visible beneath the door of one the nearer stalls.

Mindful of privacy, Llewyn goes a few stalls over and bumps its door open.
74

INSIDE THE STALL
Llewyn lowers himself into close shot.
He sits for a beat, waiting for things to develop.
His eyes idly shift. His look catches on something: |
Grafitti on the partition wall:

What are you doing!
Llewyn gazes at it.

There is the sound of slithering fabric ending with a flop-thump that echoes on the tile,

Licwyn frowns. He starts to rise.

BATHROOM
Llewyn emerges from his stall and goés'to the other occupied stall. Roland Turner is

partly visible lying on the floor. Part of an arm is visible: coat off, sleeve pushed up,
hose wrapped. {

He is face-up head toward us so that the top half of his face is visible. Hf is unconscious,
eyes rolled up;‘sheened with sweat. He twitches.

Roland Turner is twitching more violently.

Llewyn reenters the bathroom leading Johnny Five. ‘

}
You stay with him, I'll call an ambulance. i

Johnny Five, unconcerned, flicks the match with which he has lit a fresh cigarette.
75

Johnny Five
Nah, he’s fine.

He goes for the body.

Grab his sticks.

RESTAURANT

Johnny Five has one of Roland Turner’s arms draped over his shoulder and is helping
him—all but hauling him—toward the door. Llewyn follows with his canes.

CAR

Johnny Five is easing Roland Turner into the back seat.

The displaced cat walks circles around the part of the seat still unoccupied.

Llewyn dumps in the canes with a clatter,

The door is slammed shut,

DRIVING

Johnny Five gazes out, driving orie-handed, cigarette on his lip.

His free’hand fiddles the radio knob,

Very intermittent headlight-bys, accompanied by the whoosh of tires on wet asphalt.
Whining static hisses into music as Johnny finds a live station.

The thud of our car’s wheels on road seams.

Llewyn eases his head back against the headrest.

Johnny Five starts humming along with a pop song.

FADE OUT PICTURE AND SOUND

Close on Llewyn opening his eyes, i
The car is parked. It is still night.
Llewyn looks to his left:

Johnny Five is also stirring. Past him, a sweep of light ends with:another shwack: a
flashlight rapping against the driver’s window. 7

Johnny rolls it down. Our view from the passenger’s sideicrops:the head of the leather-
jacketed cop standing outside. 5

The wheels of a passing car whoosh by behind the cop: we-are lower than the roadbed,
pulled off on a shoulder. {

The cop shines his light into Johnny Five's face. i

Cop
I didn’t ask you. You, get out of the car.
Johnny Five
Me?
Cop

You. Get out of the car.
Johnny Five opens the door, gets out.

Cop
C’mere.

The cop grabs him by the upper arm.

I want you to walk this—
From Llewyn's point-of-view: Johnny Five shakes the hand off; The two torsos are
taked by a twirl of white light as the flashlight is-dropped. A confusion of body parts as
the officer regrabs Johnny and Johnny violently swings his arm away. Johnny’s body is
spun and slammed into the car chest-first.
Llewyn recoils at the impact.

Johnny’s arms are being twisted béhind his back. He is yanked away.

Llewyn’s look follows, view half-obscured by car body and sleeping Roland Turner in
the back seat.

Johnny is frogma rched, hands cuffed behind his back, toward and past the headlights of a
car parked behind. ‘Its:slowly turning gumball light sketchily shows the cop opening the
back door, putting his hand on top of Johnny’s head to sit him in, then climbing in front.

After a beat the siren fires up and the police car lurches into gear and bumps up onto the
toad, spitting shoulder gravel. It hangs a hard U-turn.

Red tail lights grow smaller. The siren recedes.
Llewyn’s look shifts from back window to back seat.
Roland Turner sleeps on, breathing softly, sweating lightly.

The disturbed cat walks back and forth on the seat.

Llewyn closes the door.
He mounts the shoulder to the road.

Sparse traffic both ways. Headlights hit him from front, from back. Thet backlight shows
his breath vaporizing, \

He takes a few steps in the direction the parked car was pointed, glances back.
His point-of-view: the car, a toppy view since it sits on a low shoulder. Dark inside.

Back to Llewyn. A few more steps. A car is approaching: he walks backwards, sticking

Down from the shoulder a little ditch separates highway from broad weedy verge.
Further still is a service road and on ita CTA bus terminus: fenced-in lot with a bus
shelter outside of it.

Wind blows. The verge is patched with old snow.

The car pulls away and Llewyn goes down the shoulder, wades into the grass clogging
the ditch, tries to hop and jump over the lowest point.

We hear a liquid squush.

Llewyn
Goddamnit.

He comes grimacing up the other side.
Goddamn. Shit. Fuck.

He looks down at shoes and cuffs, soaked through.
Goddamn piss,

He crunches across crusted snow patches toward the bus stop.

BUS INTERIOR.
Llewyn is one of two Passengers:in the parked bus.
Suddenly its'public address’sounds.

The driver, talking into his handset, says something about the route unintelligible through
the PA.

The other passenger sits reading a newspaper, not listening.

The driver muscles the door shut and puts the bus in motion.

BACK OF CLUB

There is a stage door. Llewyn pushes on it: it gives.

INTERIOR CLUB
The house is dark. Llewyn has entered from just off a little stage.

Llewyn
Hello?

There is an office door ajar in back. A young man sticks his head out.

Man
Hello?
Llewyn
Is Bud Grossman here?
Man

Isn’t in yet.
The person disappears back into the office,
Llewyn looks around, a little lost. He projects:

Can I wait here?

From inside the office:

Sure. Maybe an hour,

LATER

Llewyn has one of the chairs down off a table and his guitar out and is playing, idling.

The scrape of the stage door. Llewyn stops playing.

Bud Grossman enters, stamping off snow. He has a nice coat.

He walks toward the back, past Llewyn, noticing him but not interested. |

Llewyn, perhaps waiting for Bud Grossman to speak first, now watches him pass and

disappear into the back office.
Murmur of voices.

Llewyn leans the guitar against the table, picks up his bag and goes'to t

Bud Grossman and the young man we saw earlier look up from their cor\ersation,

Llewyn

Bud Grossman
Yeah?
Llewyn
I, uh. I’m Llewyn Davis.

i, Bud Grossman
Uh-huh.,

va Llewyn
I’m sorry—do you know who I am?

Bud Grossman

No.

Llewyn

“Inside Llewyn Davis”—

Bud Grossman
Oh, you’re with Mel?

 

84
85
Llewyn
Yeah, I was in Chicago—just Passing through, uh—do you
like the record?

Bud Grossman
Don’t know. Didn’t get it.

Llewyn digs in his bag.

Llewyn
Here it is, this is it anyway. It’s, here it is.

Bud Grossman takes it, looks at it,
That’s five dollars.

Bud Grossman doesn’t react.

He looks up from the record, Llewyn holds his look for a beat.
... T was joking,

Bud Grossman
Uh-huh.

Liewyn
Well, I’m interested in maybe gigging here but also in
: Obtaining management.—

Bud Grossman

Llewyn
Not, uh. . . not, uh—

Bud Grossman
Yeah I'll bet.

The faintest smile fades, He shrugs.

Okay. Let’s hear something.
Llewyn -
... You don’t want to listen to the record?

Bud Grossman
Why should I, you’re here. Play me something.

He looks down at the record.
Play me something from. . . Inside Llewyn Davis.

87
Llewyn keeps éye contact and does not display emotion either.

At length:

Llewyn
Okay.

Another beat. Bud Grossman doesn’t get up; neither does Llewyn.
Okay. That’s it?
Bud Grossman shrugs a What else would there be?

Bud Grossman
You're okay. You're not green.

Llewyn nods at the compliment, such as it is. He hesitates; then:

Llewyn
But I don’t have what, say, Troy Nelson has,

For the first time, Bud Grossman seems pleasantly interested:

Bud Grossman
You know Troy?* oe

Llewyn
Yeah.

Bud Grossman
Good kid. (nods thoughtfully) Good kid.

Llewyn rises. Bud Grossman continues:
- +. Yeah, he connects with people.

Bud Grossman watches Llewyn stowing his guitar.
Look, I’m putting together a trio. Two guys and a girl
singer. You're no front guy but if you can grow a goatee,
stay out of the sun, we might see how your voice works

with the other two. Comfortable with harmonies?

Llewyn
No. Yes, but, no. I-had a partner.
Bud Grossman

Uh-huh, well that makes sense. My suggestion? Get ba¢k

together. :

Llewyn
That’s good advice. Thank you Mr. Grossman.

The bus terminal is in the background. A very low, very weak; Brayed-qut sun hangs at
the horizon. The wind blows hard. :

Llewyn is negotiating the ditch, coming toward the foreground highway} guitar across his
back and bag in hand. i

i
SAME PLACE
Several minutes later.

Now dusk: some ambient light but the cars all have headli ights on. It hasistarted to snow.

A car pulls over to where Llewyn stands with his thumb out. A crew-cut college-age

youth leans over to roll dowir the passénger window and look up at him. |

 

ay wes Youth \
‘Where’ you going? t
: . Llewyn
New York.
Youth \

“ I
Man, that’s great! I’m going home to New Jersey, I have |
not slept—you drive, right?

Llewyn
Yeah.

Youth
Well as long as you drive and let me sleep, we can do it al
the way, man! Put your cello in back.
$*

89

Llewyn opens the back door to stow his gear. The youth unstraps his seatbelt and slides
over to the passenger side. .

You're not gonna try to talk to me?
Llewyn
No. Just show me the knob for the windshield wipers.
FULL NIGHT

A point-of-view: heavier snow swirls into headlights and sticks soft and:dark to the
foreground windshield. The wipers, beating a soporific thid-thud, take ‘it away.

Passenger seat: the crew-cut youth, asleep. Regular, heavy breathing.
Llewyn driving. Bedraggled.
Llewyn looks around the dash, locates, and reaches.

The radio goes on. The tuner is thumbed through static hiss. Coming through it, finally,
distant music. Knob-fiddling cannot make.clear. More exploring. Radio off.

Llewyn blinks himself more awate.” He reset ‘to something he sees:
Hinging point-of-view:of appréaching’sign: it marks the turnoff for Cleveland.

Liewyn’s head turns-as he tracks.the sign. His eyes shift in the direction of the sign’s
arrow. ‘ e
A glow through the snow of distant city lights.

Back to Llewyn. His eyes hold on the ghost of the city for a brief beat, then shift back
forward.

He drives.

FADE OUT

LATER

Still snowing.
As he drives Llewyn sings, half aloud, “Ladies of Spain.”
A glance over at:
The youth, still sleeping deeply.

A look back forward—and a startled reaction:

90

Almost as soon as we see it, movement in the headlights is lost below tile hood.

Impact thud. Squeal of brakes.

3

Llewyn rocks forward at the hard brake and so does the youth, who then; flops back. His

deep breathing continues undisturbed,

Llewyn takes a wide-eyed moment, He looks around through the back window,

Nothing is visible outside except dimly falling snow.

Llewyn opens his door,

EXTERIOR

Driver's side headlight in the foreground. Blood on the bumper.

\

|

{

Llewyn is walking into the foreground to look. A looking beat. He receties into the

background.

He stands behind the idling:car, looking at the highway behind.

No traffic, peaceful, dark, falling snow. Nothing visible on the road.
Llewyn’s 100K travels.

‘Something catches his eye.

Movement, perhaps thirty yards back, off the shoulder: a smal] animal?

Llewyn squints against snow,

1

A badger- or ferret-sized creature is hauling itself haltingly toward the woods that line the
highway. Before we get a good look at it, it disappears into the dark:of the trees.

 

t
 

91

On Llewyn, looking.

CAR INTERIOR

Llewyn sits in.

The engine rumbles in park.
The wipers thud.

The youth breathes in and out.

After a beat, Llewyn puts the car in gear.

EXTERIOR
Locked-down: the car pulls away from us, into the background. Tail lights recede, leave
us in falling'snow.
SUBWAY CAR
Loud train clatter bangs in at the cut,
No time of day: we.are underground. Llewyn sits in a mostly empty car, still with guitar
and bag, and still—judging by his unrelieved haggard look—sleepless.
CLOSE ONILLEWYN ASLEEP
Early morning—somewhere.
Llewyn emetges from peaceful sleep. He rolls onto his back, looking up.
Cottage-cheese ceiling, underlit by light leaking around a curtain.
Llewyn rises to an elbow, looks around, orienting himself.
_ Achild’s room. He is in a child’s bed.

A plastic red-framed something on the nightstand at his elbow: he picks it up.
An Etch-a-Sketch. Written on it in the spidery way permitted by the delice:

Welcome Uncle Llewyn

EXTERIOR

Morning. Llewyn emerges from his sister’s Queens house.

GREAT HALL

Cut in with a crash of echoing walla. It is the interior hall'of a once-grand beaux-art
institution gone to seed.

Llewyn sits at the battered wooden desk of an aging man who seems more working-
class than bureaucrat. |

 

Man |
No you cannot. |
Llewyn |
Why? \
Man }
Ya not on the rosta.
; Be a Llewyn
Well, okay:€an you put me on the roster?
Q Man \
Me?: No I cannot. {
Llewyn |
Why?
Man ‘
Why ya think? |
1
Llewyn

I don’t know. Because I’m a communist.
93
The man, suddenly less bored, glances around and then leans in, voice lowered:
Man
Shachmanite?
Llewyn
What?
Man

(‘my mistake”)
Nah, no. It ain’t that. Y’ain’t current. °

Llewyn
I’m not current.

Man
That’s another way of puttin it.

Llewyn
Is that a nautical term?

Man
Y’ain’t current, on ya dues;..Pay ya dues, ya go back on the
rosta, I can ship.ya out. Ss a post on The Maid Of
The Gate, Seanian First Class} weighs anchor this Friday
6pm.

  

Llewyn is looking in his wallet.

i
|

Llewyn
The money, what I owe, can’t they take it out of, whatever,
the first week? I can’t run out on it, I’m in your fucking
sardine can.

Man
Yeah, they don’t do that. Ya gotta be current to ship out.

Llewyn finishes thumbing through his wallet.

Llewyn
Okay. Wow. I just make it. [’m leaving naked, man.
Clean start. Can I pay you?

Man
| 94
Yeah. I’ll write yaa receipt. And the pier and ship number, and the
time. Still got ya Masters Mates and Pilots License, right?
Ain’t shippin out without that. /

Llewyn
Yeah, I got it. 1
{
Man |
Okay. Here it is. “Llewyn Davis.” Ya not Hugh’s kid
ya?
Llewyn
Why not. i

OCEAN

Looking out at gray ocean and gray sky. Waves beat,weaklyagainst foreground rocky
shore. .

A building: a hulking brick institutional building facing the water. Over'a rectilinear
portico is the building’s name: Landfall: :

INSIDE

A card set into a metal frame on:atile wall, next to an interior door. Below the card is a
glass display box. On the card, in marker, two names:

Hugh Davis
John Corsicatto

x aré little personal mementos and snapshots. Some of the photos show an
1.a'sWweater with a grandson, and with grandson and Joy and a man presumably
_Joy’s husband. There is also a ship-in-the-bottle inside the display box, and a few
“greeting cards.

  

From off, the sound of a door being pushed open.

INSIDE ROOM

As Llewyn enters with guitar case.
95

Llewyn
Hiya.

Hugh Davis sits by the window, not looking out. He does look up at Llewyn’s entrance.

The other occupant of the room, on the bed further from the window, is mostly hidden
by a curtain:on a ceiling ring. We see only. his slippered feet.

Llewyn sets:down his guitar and swings a chair around to face his father.
.-. How’s it going.
No answer, but none, it seems, is expected.

... Taking off, Pop. Won’t see you for a while, shipping
out.

His father’s look rests upon him, not with much expression.
A beat of looking at each other.
Llewyn rises, not uncomfortable, to look out the rib-height window.
... Try something new.
He looks out for a beat.
see mean, something old.
His point-of-view: parking lot, some marshy grass, ocean.
He shrugs, looking out. He sits back down.
. .. How’s it going.
The old man's eyes have followed him back and forth.
Llewyn leans forward to unclasp the guitar case. He withdraws the guitar.
... Okay, here’s this. You used to like this.

He limbers his fingers briefly, then plays, and sings, “Ladies of Spain.”
\ 96
The old man watches him sing. Once, even, his eyes shift to look at the guitar
fingering. \

Second verse. The old man’s eyes shift, dreamily, to the window. They hold there fora
long beat, then return to Llewyn as the song finishes, The last chord is held, and rings
out. The two men look at each other, lost, it seems, in the music as it i away.
A long beat, and then, from Llewyn, softly: :

.. Wow.
Another silent beat, and a more definite:

. Wow.

He looks briefly at John Corsicatto, then back at his father.
He ealizes he still holds the guitar and stirs, learis: forward:to lay it gently in its case,
and rises, ‘ welt

HALLWAY

Wide, looking the length of the hall with. sun:glaring on the linoleum and streaking the
tile walls. Llewyn emerges from his father’s room small, in the background, without the

guitar.

Emerged fully into the hall he stops, and looks briefly up and down its length.
He walks toward us, head turning to look into the rooms he passes.

We jump in'oit'His wailk as he checks to the side, and then stops:

A young:black orderly is making a bed in an empty room.

Llewyn
Excuse me.

The man looks up.
+». Can I... trouble you... My father, uh, had an accident

and uh. . . might need some help. . . He needs to be
cleaned.
97
QUEENS HOUSE

Llewyn enters with his guitar. His sister is in the kitchen at the stove, and a six-year-old
sits eating at the table.

Joy
How is he?
Llewyn
He’s great. Good to see what I have to look forward to.
Joy
What. Llewyn.
Llewyn

No, I’m not kiddin. I’ve got it all figured out now. Put in
some hard years, yeah, but eventually ya get to kick back,

Llewyn

Llewyn

From the house, where’s my file box?

She stares at him,
i
Joy

98
He stares back.
I
Llewyn ;
All the old stuff! Fuck, Joy, you threw out my file box? i
Joy

Llewyn i
Yeah, no cursing, except now I gotta go back to the fuckihg
union hall! It had my Masters Mates and Pilots license, |
Jesus Christ, Joy! :
i
She comes close so that Danny won’t hear. A fierce whisper:

; i
Joy . 1
You told me to put it out by the curb. It's what I did. I
want you to leave. Get outta heah:

Angry, not apologetic:

Llewyn
Fuck. Yeah. I know, I’m adick, right?
Joy
That’s right.
Llewyn looks at the eating child:
Llewyn
Danny, your uncle’s a bad man.
. Danny 4
Okay.
“FOYER. DIRECTORY

The, familiar glass-covered tenant listing, showing BERKEY 6c.
A finger enters to buzz.

Filtered:
Jean
Hello?

Wider on the foyer as Llewyn, guitar on back and bag in hand, leans in to a round mesh
grill:

Llewyn
It's Llewyn don't hang up | don't wanna stay, I just need a
place to dump my stuff please I'm tired of dragging it all

UPSTAIRS:
As Jean lets:Llewyn into the apartment. She indicates where the bags may be stowed:

Jean

This gets a genuine laugh from Jean.
. Jean
Oh come on.
LOW SHOT
Llewyn in the union hall.

Llewyn
Are you shitting me?

A different old geezer than in the first visit.

Man
In what way, buddy?
Llewyn
Eighty-five dollars. To replace the license.
Man
You don’t row out the licerise. That’s the one thing you

Llewyn

THE GASLIGHT

Three Irishmen in Aran Island sweatéts are performing traditional music;

The house is full and:some people wateh leaning back against the bar. Liewyn is the only
Person seated at the bar and facing it, glowering, a drink in his fist.

Nick Porco sits in, sqtieezing Llewyn's shoulder.

aan Nick
Hey. We gonna hear you tomorrow.

Llewyn
(no warmth)
I guess you are.

Nick
Well—ya welcome. (no answer) Wuddya think a these
guys?

Llewyn swivels, drink still in hand, and looks darkly at the stage.
 

103
At length:

Llewyn
I like the sweaters.

Nick stares at the stage also, mouth open, nodding.
At length:
| Nick
Ya know, you wouldn't fuckin believe the rent here. This
folk shit, I don't know.
Both men stare at the stage.
--+ You know any comics?

A beat.

Llewyn
Only you, Nick.

   

wm. (after a beat gazing at

2 phical) Comics, they don't look
like much,.most of' em. Jews, by'n large. Lookin like that

Llewyn
You mean they wanna fuck Jim.

: Nick
. Exactly! (he nods) Exactly. Well. (sighs) Me... I've
| only fucked Jean.

The Irish trio's song, and set, is ending, to applause. Nick's line has brought Llewyn's
look around from the stage.
104

Llewyn i
Huh? '

Nick is thumping his hands together for the trio.
Nick :
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Ya know. Ya wanna play the
Gaslight... .
Nick shrugs. !
Llewyn's look darkens further, and swings back to the stage. :

Llewyn
Huh. yoo4

Irish Singer : :
Thank you ladies and gentlemen; Thank you’. ::Thank you
Nick Porco, and let's all give a great big welcome to
Elizabeth Hobby, from Elinora, Arkansas!

An older woman smiles thanks as she takes the stage with an autoharp. She has stringy
blond hair and a gaunt face and frame, and her smile, though warm, shows that she is
missing a tooth or two.
Elizabeth Hobby ;
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Yer so nice, Thank you.
This is my first show in New York— i

Llewyn bellows:

° Llewyn
How'd ya get the gig, Betty?

A few: uncomprehending titters from the house.
Elizabeth Hobby, flustered, shades her eyes. i

Elizabeth Hobby
. +» Hello?

Llewyn, with a significant look to Nick, points a finger at the woman onstage and cocks
his head to pose a question. :
105
Nick Porco laughs.
ie
Nick
Aw c'mon Llewyn, gimme a little credit.

Elizabeth Hobby
I'm gonna do a song, it's like most of the songs I do, it's a
‘song I grew up with.

She starts playing and singing.
Llewyn
Where’s your heybale!

Looks and shushes from other customers,

... Where’s your corncob pipe! . Ya wearing gingham
panties? Show us your panties!

Nick ©
C'mon Llewyn. It's enough.

He shakes off Nick's hand.

Llewyn
_ Uhate fucking folk music.

Nick motions to the. bartender,
‘ Nick
, Okay Eddie. We might need Bob.

: . Llewyn
Fuck Bob! Fuck you, Nick!
FRONT OF THE GASLIGHT

Wide on the front of the club as Llewyn stumbles out, under impetus from the bartender
and another man.

There is the beginnings of a line for the second set. Llewyn glares at the onlookers, and,
as he starts to wander off:
106

Llewyn :
The show is bullshit. Three micks and Grandma Moses.;

 

STREET
A phone booth seen in wide shot,
Wind blows, traffic goes by. {

Llewyn is a small figure in the booth, not on the phone but looking‘down motionless,
studying something held in one hand. é

 

We jump in as he reaches for it with his other hand: his open address
turns the page, lingers for a moment, turns again. : t

APARTMENT DOOR SWINGING OPEN

Mitch Gorfein beams out,
Mitch

Llewyn

Thanks, Mitch. Ereally ‘appreciate this, after last time. I
just can’t tell you:how sorry I—

os Mitch
OK forget it! We all get a little emotional over Mike: It

Llewyn
Yeah. Uh-huh.

Mitch

Llewyn
Just a day or two, if it’s okay. Just until I figure out the
next, um. . . the next—

Mitch

This is Arlen and Dodi Gamble. This is Llewyn Davis, our
folksinger friend. Arlen knows Jim Berkey.

Arlen
You’re Jim and Jean’s friend!

Well—sort of —

Kennedy.” It was hysterical.

i
i Arlen

_ So funny! That’s gonna be a hit, man. Royalties on that,

Llewyn stares, then nods, blankly.

: Llewyn

T wish I was in your business—one hit can fix you up!
Llewyn
Uh. Yeah, I—
Lillian
¢ .Llewyn!
She enters, beaming, bearing a large bowl that she hastily places on the table so as to be
able to hug Llewyn.
Llewyn
Hi Lillian.
Lillian
I’m so sorry I upset you—
Llewyn

No no!—You’re apologizing to me? Jesus, Lillian, I—holy
108

 

shit!

He breaks the embrace, looking off.
A white Persian cat has trotted in,

-.. Well—that’s good. You got a new cat.

Mitch . ;
No. . i
Lillian :
He came home, i
She scoops the cat up,

Mitch
He found his way back, :

She is holding the cat up, belly out, by its forepaws,
++. It’s Ulysses,

Llewyn‘logks frditi'the cat’s scrotum to Lillian,

Llewyn
It’s what?

Lillian
Ulysses.

Llewyn

I didn’t, uh. . . That’s its name?
 

109
LATER
Llewyn plops down onto the study couch. Lights are off. The apartment is quiet.

He digs into pockets to empty them onto the nightstand. Coins and tokens trom one
pocket. His wallet from another. He pokes through the bill compartment: six dollars.

He shakes his head, dumps it on the nightstand.

LATER STILL
Close on Lléwyn, eyes closed, on his back, the regular breathing of deep sleep.

After a long’ beat: a soft thud and a “Huh!” of surprise from Llewyn as his body tenses
and his eyes fly open.

After a moment to register where he is, he looks down his body.

Close on the cat, standing on his chest, looking back at him, purring loudly.

NEXT MORNING
Looking down the dim hall towards'the less dim study.
Llewyn’s head peeks out.

i Llewyn
Hello?

No answer.

He emerges to walk down the hallway in his undies.

COMMON HALLWAY
Outside the apartment door.

Llewyn emerges, dressed, and takes care with one foot to keep the cat hemmed in the
apartment as‘he exits.
110
STREET

Llewyn is walking. After a beat his attention is caught by something to-one side. He
slows, looking, and stops. .

His point-of-view: an illustration of a housecat. On either side of it is a dog. The three
pets are out in the wild.

Llewyn looking.

Wider point-of-view: the illustration is a poster in a movie-theater lightbox, the:theater
not yet open. i

It is a poster for The Incredible Journey. The tag line Promises‘ 4. Fantastic True-Life
Drama.

As Llewyn stares, music fades in: Llewyn himself, perfotming “I’ve Been All Around
This World.”
CLUB

The music is a pre-lap of Llewyn in The Gaslight, spotlit as at the beginning of the
movie.

He finishes the song to applause,
: Llewyn
Thank'you. You?ve probably heard that one before, but
what the hell. . .

He rises to go but dips back into the mike:

... If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it’s a
folk song.

As the applause abates something catches Llewyn’s attention:
Nick Porco nods Llewyn over. He is broadly smiling.

Nick
Boy you were some mess last night.
11
Llewyn
Yeah, sorry, Nick. I’m an asshole.

Nick
Oh I don’t give a shit, T even agree about the music.
Funny to hear you say it though.

Liewyn
Yeah, ’ma funny guy.

“Nick
S'very true. Anyways, someone wants to see you out back.

Whe? Llewyn
10?

Nick
Guy in a suit?

A clatter offscreen attracts Llewyns attention:

Backlit in the smoky Spotlight a young:man with a dutch-boy cap and a guitar and a
harmonica on a rack is just sitting down on.the stool onstage.

He blows a couple times on the harmonica.

BACK ALLEY

The steel dogr ‘of the club swings open and Llewyn emerges. The man waiting against
the wall: :

i

j Man
' You a funny boy, huh?
|

Llewyn
. What?
The man tosses his cigarette away and pushes himself off the wall.

Man
, Had to open ya big mouth, funny boy?

Llewyn
 

112
Had to—what? It’s what I do. For a living. Who’re—

Man
What ya do? Make fun a folks up there. Folks up there
sangin?
Llewyn

I’m sorry, what? I’m—oof!
The man has just socked him in the mouth.

Man
You sit there in the audience last night yellin yer crap?

Llewyn is holding his mouth.

Llewyn
Oh for Christ’s sake. You yell stuff; it’s a show.

Man
Ain’t a fuckin fag show!

He hits him again.
... Wasn’t your show!
He hits him again and Llewyn goes down in the slush of the alleyway.

. Llewyn
It’s not the opera; jackass!

He kicks. Llewyn'curls into a defensive ball and bellows from behind protective
forearms:

Llewyn
It’s a fucking baskethouse!

The man kicks again.

Man
We leavin this fuckin cesspool. You kin have it, smartass.

More kicking.
113
Yellin yer crap when my wife is up there tryin to sang! And there was
a record man there ya fuckin fag! I took her home eryin!

As the kicking and Llewyn’s reaction abates, we can hear the performer inside the club.
It is Bob Dylan performing “I Was Young When I Left Home.”

The man is striding down the alley.

Llewyn stays balled up for a long moment. Once he is certain no more kicks are
coming, he begins, slowly and painfully, to straighten out, exploring tender places with
one hand. .

The man has disappeared around the alley corner.

Llewyn rises experimentally to a crouch, straightens a little more. He takes a few
uneven steps toward the mouth of the alley, one hand brushing the wall for balance.

Near the mouth of the alley he sinks back down to seated position, back against the wall,
looking down the street in the direction the man exited.

The mar is halfway down the block. He raises his hand and whistles down an oncoming
cab. He climbs in.

After a short beat, the cab starts moving again.
As it passes the mouth of the alley, Llewyn touches two fingers to his forehead in salute.

Llewyn
Au revoir.

i
The cab is Ppt
Its tail lights recede.
