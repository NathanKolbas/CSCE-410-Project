FADE IN:

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 1

BRAD SLOAN, lies in bed, staring anxiously up at the ceiling.
His wife, MELANIE, is asleep beside him. Moonlight
illuminates the room. It is deathly silent, then we HEAR a
NARRATOR's voice.

NARRATOR
Brad was lying in bed at 3AM
wondering why he felt so anxious.

CLOSE ON BRAD as his mind wanders from thought to thought.

NARRATOR
He scanned through all the possible
sources of his dread - as there
were many - until he seized upon
the Architectural Digest.

Brad winces as his memory is stirred.

INT. SACRAMENTO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 2

TEN PEOPLE are gathered in a living room, drinking and
chatting.

NARRATOR
That night, he and Melanie had gone
to a dinner party with some of her
co-workers.

Brad spots an ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST on the coffee table. He
notices the cover and picks it up.

ON ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST
Photos of some sleek modern house.
NARRATOR
There was a photo spread of a

hideous steel and glass monstrosity
in Los Angeles.

The page flips. The owner of the house, NICK and his LATINO
BOYFRIEND sit on the couch, grinning, in one of the photos.

NARRATOR
Brad realized the home belonged to
a college friend, Nick Pascale.

ON BRAD - he grimaces at the photo - a stricken look.

NARRATOR
The article stated he bought the
house for nine million dollars and
put another two into it.

BACK AND CLOSER ON PHOTO OF NICK AND HIS HUSBAND.

NARRATOR
Brad knew Nick had become
successful, but felt gut-punched
nonetheless.

Brad tosses down the magazine.

OMIT 3

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 4

As the other GUESTS, including Melanie, laugh and chat, Brad
glumly stares into space.

NARRATOR
This ruined the dinner party for
Brad. He stared into space mostly.

GLIMPSES of the other DINNER GUESTS, talking and eating.

NARRATOR
He realized the other people at the
table were mediocrities.
Underachieving beta males, living
in Sacramento, a secondary market.
Guys thinking they were big fish in
the most inconsequential of ponds.

Brad looks around at the others with a sour expression.
NARRATOR

He felt contempt for himself and
everyone there.
BRAD'S STATUS - WHITE VERSION - Sept 13, 2016 - Page 3

INT. BRAD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 5

Brad rolls over in bed, restless and agitated. He picks up
his cell phone on the side table. It GLOWS to life.

NARRATOR
Brad’s mind went to other successes
that pained him.

ON PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

We SEE Brad’s finger scroll across a SERIES of GOOGLE IMAGES
of Craig Fisher - a political wonk and talking head. Craig -
in a studio, posing with the President, getting interviewed.

NARRATOR
There was Craig Fisher - who had
worked for the White House. He had
written two successful books and
was always on TV. He had always
been a self-confident know-it-all
and now life had affirmed his
delusions of grandeur.

We now SEE Brad’s fingers ZOOM in close on a PHOTO of Craig,
his WIFE and TWO DAUGHTERS all smiles, at an event.

ON BRAD - illuminated by the light of the phone, he grimaces.
He puts the phone down. He looks back up at the ceiling.

NARRATOR
He thought about Jason Hatfield...

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY 6

JASON HATFIELD walks with TWO EXECS. An attractive ASSISTANT
intercepts him and they hop in the back of a waiting SUV.

NARRATOR
..+-whose hedge fund had made him
obscenely wealthy. That he was a
nice guy who was a philanthropist
and had even given money to Brad's
non-profit somehow made it even
worse.

EXT. MAUI BEACH - DAY 7

A tan BILLY WERSTLER sits on the beach with TWO YOUNG SURFER
GIRLS, chatting them up.

(CONTINUED)
BRAD'S STATUS - Pink Revision - Sept. 29, 2016- Page 4

NARRATOR
And Billy Werstler who had made
enough money from his tech start-up
to retire in Maui before he was
even forty.

INT. BRAD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 8
Brad grits his teeth, his mind reeling.

NARRATOR
Everyone had won the lottery but
him. Bitter adrenaline pumped
through Brad’s body. He was never
going to get back to sleep.

INT. BRAD’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 9

Brad's son, TROY, age six, is playing something for him on an
electric keyboard. Brad looks over at...

...THE TV - where Craig Fisher is being interviewed on a news
program.

NARRATOR
He remembered the first time he’d
seen Craig Fisher being interviewed
on TV.

ON BRAD - he stops listening to Troy and stares mesmerized at
the TV. He rises, pointing at Craig’s talking head.

NARRATOR
The memory was like a cluster of
needles in his heart. This wasn’t
a fleeting jealousy. It was pain.
It was real pain.

BRAD
(calling toward kitchen)
Melanie!

CLOSER ON BRAD - as he digests this vision.
NARRATOR

Why was it so painful? What was
wrong with him?

10 INT. BRAD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 10

Agitated and trying to get comfortable, Brad accidentally
swats Melanie in the face, waking her.

MELANIE
Brad!

BRAD
Shit, sorry.

MELANIE
(half-asleep)
What the hell? You just hit me in
the face.

BRAD
Sorry, sorry. I can’t sleep.
(beat)
How much do you think your parents
house is worth?

MELANIE

My parents’ house? I don’t know.
BRAD

Like two million? Two and a half?
MELANIE

I don’t know.
BRAD

You've never thought about it?
MELANIE

Not really.
BRAD

(grabs his phone)
It’‘ll say on Zillow.

MELANIE
Why are you doing this?

BRAD
(types into phone)
It says 1.857. That seems low, no?
For Seattle? 4300 square feet.
Zillow is always low. I bet 2.5 at
least. Don’t you think?

What does it matter?

BRAD
Well, aren’t you getting the house
when they die?

MELANIE
When they die? I mean, I split it
with my brother.

BRAD
Really?

MELANIE
What?

BRAD

But your brother married into a ton
of money. He and Vanessa don’t
need your parents’ money.

MELANIE
It doesn’t matter anyway, Brad. I
mean...

BRAD
Why? Because of climate change?
You think the world’s gonna end
before we retire?

MELANIE
Uh, no.

BRAD
We might need that money, Mel.

MELANIE
I think they’re considering leaving
it all to the grandkids.

BRAD
What do you mean?

MELANIE
Splitting everything among the
grandkids.

BRAD
What? Steve has three kids. And
they’re already rich. We only have
one. How’s that fair?

MELANIE
It’s not up to me. They’ve also
thought about just leaving it all
to charity so who knows?

BRAD
Seriously? That’s absurd. That's
mean.

MELANIE

You work for a non-profit - and you
think that’s absurd?

BRAD
Right. I work for a non-profit.
And you work for the government.
We need the money.

MELANIE
Look, I’m gonna be so distraught
when my parents die, I’m not gonna
give a fuck about the money.

BRAD
Really? Not at all? I think you
will.

MELANIE

What about your dad? You have
money coming to you.

BRAD
He’s an academic. Two hundred
thousand dollars maybe.

MELANIE
It’‘ll help pay for Troy’s college.
Is that why you’re worrying about
money? We’ll be fine. We’1l
figure it out.

BRAD
Thank god we only had one kid.

MELANIE
Oh my god.

BRAD
How much do you think your parents
are worth total? Four? Five?
Split in half. Then taxes. That’s
like 1.5, 1.2.

And they’1ll probably have health

living places can eat up the whole
entire thing in no time...

MELANIE
What is wrong with you?

BRAD
I just feel like we’re running out
of time here. There’s no more
potential - this is it - we've
plateaud - and clearly there’s not
gonna be some windfall out of
nowhere that’s gonna change the
situation...

MELANIE
We're not poor, Brad.

BRAD
In some circles. Yeah.

MELANIE
What circles? The one per cent?
Please. Go to sleep.

Brad rolls over, then rolls back to her.

BRAD
I can’t.

MELANIE
Stop thinking about this.

BRAD
We didn’t work this hard to end up
dying in a flophouse. You know?

MELANIE
(turning away from him)
You're freaking me out. Enough.
We have a great life.

BRAD
I think you should talk to your
parents and get some clarity.
The grandkids don’t need the money.
Especially Steve and Vanessa's.
I've seen their posts. They live
like Saudi Arabian princesses. They
have their whole lives ahead of
them anyway. You and I are done!

Please shut up.

Brad shuts up. He stares into the middle distance.

EXT. SACRAMENTO NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN 11

The sun is rising over Brad’s residential neighborhood -
modest, but attractive homes.

A YOUNG CYCLIST barrels down the center of the empty road.
SPRINKLERS go off at a nearby house.

A NEIGHBOR closes his trash can and pulls it up the drive.

EXT. BRAD’S HOUSE - DAWN 11A

ESTABLISHING SHOT as a CAR drives by.

INT. BRAD’S HOUSE - MORNING 12
A few images of the house.

A FRAMED PHOTO of Brad, Melanie and their son, Troy - in the
photo, maybe nine years old. They are all smiling.

A SUITCASE on ROLLERS is placed by the front door.

INT. TROY’S BEDROOM - MORNING 13

Troy, now 17, sits in a towel on his bed, with his BULLDOG.
Troy stares lovingly at the dog.

CLOSE on Bulldog as he lifts his neck so Troy can scratch it.

TROY
I know you get mad when I go away.
Please don’t piss on the bed.

Brad opens the door.

BRAD
We have ten minutes.

TROY
(rising)
Yeah, I’m ready. I just gotta put
on my clothes.

14 INT. MELANIE’S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY 14

Melanie drives, talking to Troy, who sits in the back. Brad
is in the passenger seat, looking out the window.

TROY
I have it, Mom. It’s all on my
phone.

MELANIE

Will you forward it to your dad? I
don’t think he has any sense of the
schedule. Do you Brad?

(no response)
I don’t think he has any idea. So
it’s really on you, honey...

CLOSE ON BRAD - he is lost in thought. We can HEAR Melanie
and Troy continue to talk in the b.g.

NARRATOR
The entire ride to the airport,
Brad kept thinking about his
protege, Chris Kanew - and about
how Chris Kanew had quit that week.
And all the things he said.

15 INT. CHIPOTLE - LUNCH 15
Brad sits at a LUNCH PLACE with a young colleague, CHRIS.

BRAD
So wait - I don’t understand?
Sounds like you’re quitting.

CHRIS
(solemn nod)
I am quitting. I got another job
actually. I start in two weeks.

BRAD
What? Where?

CHRIS

San Francisco. At City National.
In their brokerage office.

Wait a minute. You’re getting into
banking?

CHRIS

(nods)
I've loved working with you, Brad.
I’ve learned a lot from you. But I
think this job has made me... kinda
depressed. And I actually think I
can do more good by just making a
lot of money - and giving it away.
Instead of spending all my time
asking other people for their money
to give away. You know?

Brad stares at him, floored.

INT. MELANIE’S CAR - TRAVELING - DAY 16

As Melanie and Troy chat, Brad stares out the window, sinking
into a deep funk.

NARRATOR
As he remembered the exchange, Brad
felt a hot flush of humiliation.
He felt exposed in some essential
and embarrassing way. It seemed so
obvious that his life’s work was an
absurdity. It might as well be
tattooed across his face.

Brad absently covers the invisible tattoo on his forehead.

EXT. SACRAMENTO AIRPORT - DAY 17

Brad pulls their bags from the trunk. Melanie comes gives
Troy a big hug.
MELANIE
Call me all the time. I want to
know everything. This is so
exciting! I love you!

TROY
Thanks, Mom. Should be cool.

Melanie approaches Brad. She’s emotional.

BRAD

He’s not leaving yet. We’re just
looking at schools.

MELANIE

(in tears)
I know. It just feels like a big
moment. I’m so jealous. I wish I
didn’t have this stupid conference.

(composes herself; smiles)
The flight info’s all on your phone
- the hotels - it’s all there. Be
happy. Be present. Okay?

(hugs BRAD)
And take pictures. I love you.

Melanie gives Troy one last kiss, then gets back in the car.
They wave her off.

INT. SACRAMENTO AIRPORT - DAY 18
Brad hands his and Troy’s tickets to a TSA OFFICER.

TSA OFFICER
The economy entrance is that line.

BRAD
Well, what is this?

TSA OFFICER
Business, first class only. Are
you TSA Pre?

BRAD
No, but I have a Silver Flyer card.

TSA OFFICER
Sorry.

Brad nods and shuffles off, with Troy in tow.
INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY 19

Brad and Troy sit in the crowded terminal, waiting for their
flight to board. Troy listens to music.

Brad watches - a YOUNG FATHER, nearby - playing with his
TODDLER SON.

After a moment, Brad turns to Troy and motions for him to
take off his headphones. Troy does.

BRAD
You know what I’m thinking? Let’s
try for an upgrade.

TROY
What do you mean?

BRAD
This is a big moment. You’re gonna
go find your college. You and me -
how many trips are we gonna have
like this again? Let’s fly
business.

TROY
Business. Really? Okay.

BRAD
I have a lot of miles I think.
Might cost a little money. It’ll
be fun. Let’s make this fucking
special. Right?

TROY
I’ve never flown business.

Brad gives Troy an emphatic that-settles-it grin then rises.

INT. GATE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER 20

Brad has waited his turn in line. He approaches the FEMALE
AIRLINE REP.

AIRLINE REP
How can I help you?

BRAD
Hi. I’m flying today with my son -
he’s a senior in high school and
we're going East to look at
colleges.

(no response)

Pretty cool. Umm, wondering if
there’s any room in business so we
could upgrade.

AIRLINE REP
Let me see. I believe there might
be. Two of you are traveling?
(taps away on computer)
Good news. There are two seats
available in business.

BRAD
Awesome.

AIRLINE REP
Can I see your tickets?

Brad hands over his tickets. As she types...

BRAD
I was hoping I could use my miles.
I have a bunch of miles I think...

AIRLINE REP
Unfortunately, no - not for this
flight, you can’t. The cost to
upgrade to business would be eight
hundred and twenty one dollars a
ticket.

(types away)
So the total would be sixteen
hundred and forty-two dollars.

BRAD
Sixteen hundred dollars? For a
domestic flight?

AIRLINE REP
Sixteen forty-two, yes.
(as he stalls)
Do you want to go ahead and
purchase the tickets?

BRAD
Uh... hmmm... sixteen...

AIRLINE REP
Do you want to sit down and think
about it while I help some of the
other passengers in line?

BRAD
You know what, let’s just do it.
(gets out wallet)
I'll put it on the Amex. I mean,
the MasterCard. No, the Amex.

BRAD

It’s a once in a lifetime thing.
My only kid - going to college.

AIRLINE REP
Mr. Sloan, actually, unfortunately -
we can’t upgrade you. I’m sorry.

BRAD
Why not?

AIRLINE REP
It seems as though you bought your
tickets on a discounted website.
With that type of ticket, we can’t
upgrade you.

BRAD
Even if I pay sixteen hundred
dollars?

AIRLINE REP
There’s actually no amount of money
you could pay to get an upgrade.
I’m so sorry. Anything else?
BRAD
Uh, no. It’s no big deal. What if
I'm a Silver Flyer Member...?
The Rep shakes her head and waves the next customer up.
Brad, disappointed, returns to his seat.
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 21
Troy and Brad board the plane, passing...

...the PASSENGERS in FIRST CLASS. They are being served
mimosas and champagne. They’re all wealthy and well-dressed.

Brad looks at them as he slowly makes his way down the aisle.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 22

Troy and Brad sit toward the back of the plane. They look
cramped and uncomfortable. Brad pulls out his SILVER FLYER
CLUB MEMBER CARD from his wallet.

BRAD
I’m sorry I couldn’t get us the
upgrade. I...

TROY
It’s no biggie.

BRAD
This Silver Flyer Card is totally
meaningless. It means nothing. It
gets you nothing.

TROY
Well, get rid of it.

BRAD
I’m gonna. I’m tossing it. Should
I? Yeah, fuck it - it’s trash.
(nowhere to throw it)
I'll just keep it for now.

Brad puts it back in his wallet and SIGHS.

INT. AIRPLANE - LATER 23

Troy listens to music and thumbs through a magazine. Brad,
deep in thought, looks out the plane’s window.

NARRATOR
On the flight, Brad wondered when
was the last time Craig Fisher flew
economy. Probably not in decades.

INT. FIRST CLASS - DAY 24

We SEE Craig Fisher, sitting in First Class, drinking a
mimosa, approached by a FLIGHT ATTENDANT.

NARRATOR
Brad imagined Craig enjoying all
the perks of first class.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Mr. Fisher, can I offer you a warm
towel?

Craig places it over his face and reclines in his cushy seat.

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY 25

Jason Hatfield and his ELEGANT WIFE and their FOUR TOWHEADED
CHILDREN cross a tarmac towards their PRIVATE PLANE.

NARRATOR
Then Brad thought about how Jason
Hatfield has his own private plane.
Probably never has to fly
commercial at all.

EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - DAY 26

Nick Pascale and his BOYFRIEND and their DOGS get out of a
HELICOPTER and cross the tarmac, then walk the stairs to
their private plane.

NARRATOR
Nick Pascale probably flies
private, too. Brad thought what a
high it must be for these guys to
always feel important and special
and better than. It must be like a
drug - a drug Brad distrusted yet
coveted, and never seemed to have
the opportunity to try.

INT. PRIVATE PLANE - DAY 27

The Hatfield family enters the plane. They begin eating,
playing, taking pictures.

NARRATOR
Brad imagined all the great
vacations they went on - the exotic
destinations.

Jason and his wife drink champagne from flutes, then chuck
the glasses. She then takes a selfie of her and Jason.

The same SELFIE PHOTO is on an INSTAGRAM page of JACQUELINE
HATFIELD.

WE SEE Brad scrolling through Jason’s wife’s Instagram page,
a sour look on his face.

ON PHONE - more PHOTOS of Jason’s family living the good
life.

NARRATOR
The adventures. And the sense of
possibility. No door ever closed.
Everything an option.

Brad puts away the phone and stares out the window.
NARRATOR
The world for them is not a
battlefield. Not even an obstacle
course.
He looks out at the clouds and the landscape below.
NARRATOR
It’s a playground. A dream. A
Heaven manifest.

Troy taps Brad on the shoulder. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands
behind him with her cart.

TROY
Dad, can I get some Pringles?
They’re seven dollars.

BRAD
Seven dollars? Yeah. Okay.

TROY
I need your credit card.

Brad pulls out his wallet and hands over the card.

29 INT. AIRPLANE - LATER 29
Troy has fallen asleep. Brad sits and stares, thinking.

EXT. TUFTS UNIVERSITY - SUNSET 30

The late ‘80’s. From a grassy knoll, we WATCH a GROUP of
MALE STUDENTS gather and greet each other. It’s a nostalgic,
beautiful image.

NARRATOR
Wasn’t Brad then the golden boy?
Wasn’t he the one destined for
great things? How did he end up
the one compromised by life and
living in the margins? Brad
likened it in his mind to a love
affair. When he was young, he was
in love with the world. And the
world loved him.

EXT. SHOT OF PLANE LANDING 30A

The SCREECH of TIRES on the runway.

INT. AIRPLANE - AFTERNOON 31
The plane has just landed. It taxis across the runway.

NARRATOR
It pained him to admit the world
had fallen out of love with him
first. This realization made him
want to cry.

Brad looks like he might cry, then realizes Troy is talking
to him.

TROY
...-they say air travel leaves a
huge carbon footprint - and with so
many people flying now, it’s a big
contributor to global warming.
Kinda sucks.

Brad snaps out of it, feigns attention to Troy.

tried to locate the moment where
things had gone wrong for him. And
when. His first thought was
Melanie.

INT. BRAD’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 33A

Brad works at the dining room table. He looks over at
Melanie - she has pulled Troy close to her and plays with his
hair as they watch TV. The Bulldog is in Troy’s lap.

NARRATOR
Yes, Melanie was a great mother and
she loved Brad and was clearly
happy with their life together.

Melanie looks over at him and smiles. He smiles back.

INT. BRAD’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 34

Brad and Melanie are having a discussion in the kitchen as
they make dinner.

Brad approaches her with a spoonful of sauce to try.

NARRATOR
But she was also easily satisfied -
and maybe her contentment
undermined his ambition.

Melanie tastes the pasta and smiles, nodding. Brad remains
skeptical that it tastes good.

INT. PRIVATE PLANE - DAY 35
Nick Pascale’s Boyfriend shows him a watch in a magazine.

NARRATOR
Nick Pascale’s boyfriend obviously
loved expensive things. Maybe his
appetites spurred Nick’s drive to
succeed.

Nick takes out a WATCH BOX and hands it to Xavier. Xavier
opens it - it’s the same watch. Xavier exults.

Craig and his wife, DIANE, are both being interviewed
separately on a red carpet before an event.

NARRATOR
And Diane Fisher was a celebrated

to become a stand-out in his field.

They stop and pose for photos.

BRAD'S DAD, a rumpled academic, sits in a reading chair,
jotting his thoughts onto a yellow legal pad.

NARRATOR
His dad had been a professor and
had spent years writing an
exhaustive study on Institutional
Fascism that was never published.

Brad's Dad reads over what he’s just written, finds it
lacking and scratches it out. He starts over.

NARRATOR
Brad found his father self-pitying
and defensive.

INT. BRAD’S PARENTS’ KITCHEN - NIGHT 41 *
Brad and his dad, now older, have an argument over dinner.

BRAD'S DAD
I don’t need the humiliation. I
know they have no interest. It’s
not about vampire children - or
whatever. These publishing
houses...

As his dad pontificates, we HEAR:

NARRATOR
His lifelong commitment to exposing
the tyranny of the powerful had
hardened over the years into a
crippling paranoia. It bothered
Brad that his father had no
perspective on his own failings -
but found fault everywhere else.

University, corporate America.

INT. PRIVATE PLANE LOUNGE - DAY 42 *

Jason Hatfield’s FATHER and MOTHER have joined the family. *
They are a distinguished-looking older couple. Jason and his
Father have an animated conversation, while his Mother

attends to her grandkids. We SEE the plane in the b.g. *

NARRATOR
Meanwhile, Jason Hatfield’s dad had
been a state senator and a
businessman. Steadfast,
uncomplicated, cheerful. Of course
Jason had been given all the tools
he needed to succeed.

They all stand to exit. A hand reaches in for a forgotten *
sweater. *
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 43

As Troy unpacks his bag, Brad sits on the bed, thinking.

NARRATOR
Unlike Brad, who had inherited his
father’s indecisiveness, his
authority complexes, his tendency
to lay blame. Even now, here he
was blaming his father for his own
disappointments.

Brad shakes his head with self-loathing.
NARRATOR
Enough. Brad's choices were his.
Brad did it. He’s the piece of
shit.
Suddenly, Troy tosses his baseball cap, hitting Brad’s head.

Brad and Troy lie back on their twin beds, both illuminated
by the glow of their laptops.

On Brad - he is wide-eyed, energized - as he stares at the
computer screen. We can HEAR classical piano leaking from
his ear buds.

NARRATOR
Brad was electrified by this latest
development. Here - suddenly - an
unexpected lifeline - something
tangible - an outward proof.

ON COMPUTER - Brad is watching a home video of Troy playing
piano. He’s clearly a prodigy.

NARRATOR
Of course. His child. His son.

Brad has tears in his eyes as he watches the video.
NARRATOR
A genius. With substance. His
heart could burst with this deep
satisfaction.
He looks over at...
...Troy, watching GAME OF THRONES on his laptop.
NARRATOR
Brad realized along the way, he’d
somehow lost the plot. Cured of
his amnesia, he now remembered what
he’d been doing for the last
seventeen years.
Troy senses he’s being watched. He looks over.

Yeah? I didn’t know about it.

NARRATOR
Brad felt numb. The fact that he’d
not been invited to Nick Pascale’s
wedding seemed to confirm every
doubt he ever had - about his
friendships, himself and his place
in the world.

Brad stops in his tracks.

INT. NICK PASCALE’S HOUSE - DAY 69

A small wedding party. Nick and Xavier are congratulated by
Craig and Diane, then Jason Hatfield and his family.

NARRATOR
Brad kept picturing the wedding
party in his mind. Everyone there,
enjoying themselves. Basking in
each other’s glow.

EXT. NICK PASCALE’S HOUSE - DAY 70
We watch Nick and Xavier exit the house and greet people on
the expansive lawn. They are approached by Billy and his Two
tan Girlfriends.
NARRATOR
Brad wondered if he’d been excluded
or simply forgotten and couldn’t

decide which was worse.

Everyone continues hugging each other and enjoying the day.

EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - DAY 71
Brad shakes his head, grimacing.
NARRATOR
Whatever. He was a non-presence.
A blip. A zero. A no-name. For a
moment, he wished he were dead.

TWO HARVARD GIRLS pass by him, laughing about something.
This snaps him out of it.

He watches them pass, then looks over...

..-under a tree, there is a HOMELESS WOMAN, talking to
herself. She looks miserable.

Brad felt a sudden kinship with
everything that was ever unloved.

CLOSE on Brad as he spots about other sad creatures.

- A MISERABLE TEEN GIRL, looking lonely, passes; An ASIAN
LADY, struggling with a heavy grocery bag; An OLD MAN, alone
on a bench, feeding pigeons.

He then looks at the HEADSTONES of an old GRAVEYARD.

NARRATOR
The abandoned, the forgotten, the
despised - those who never found
love. Never, ever, ever.

INT. BRAD’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY 72

Brad's Dad, looking old and frail, searches for something in
his den.

NARRATOR
Brad thought about his father and
how his book had been rejected by
every single publisher. How lonely
he was. How little affirmation he
received - even from Brad.

EXT. HARVARD CAMPUS - DAY 73
Brad is now emotional as he wanders back toward the campus.

NARRATOR
How cruel is this world. How
unfair. The prejudices of humans
who shower their attention on the
already popular - and ignore those
who need it the most.

save for an OLDER WOMAN, working the counter.

TROY
There’s no one in there, Dad. What
about that place?

Troy points across the street, where there’s a FESTIVE LUNCH
PLACE and a CROWD is dining, al fresco.

BRAD
Just because no one’s in here
doesn’t mean it’s not good, Troy.

TROY
Usually it does, actually.

No response. Brad puts down the laptop and rises.

Brad steps off the elevator and crosses toward the exit.
He stands in the lobby, having second thoughts.

He shakes them off and heads out, passing the same Doorman.

Ananya, Maya and a few other STUDENTS are drinking at a

Brad watches them, from the bar, looking awkward.

He turns and calls out to the BARTENDER.

BRAD

BARTENDER

Just the whiskey? Eight dollars.

Brad takes out his wallet and pulls out a TEN. He drops the

NARRATOR
Brad could tell he had lost Ananya -
lost her respect - and he
desperately wanted it back. He
thought if he could summarize the
trajectory of his life - she would
understand him - maybe even respect
him - as someone who had lost the
good fight - but had fought it
nonetheless.

INT. THE DRUID - LATER 99

Brad and Ananya are now seated at the bar with new drinks.
Brad continues talking. Ananya just listens, a blank
expression on her face.

NARRATOR

He told her about his career
mistakes - his years in journalism
just as the newspaper business was
folding. His attempt to start a
digital muckraking magazine in San
Francisco but how no one wanted to
read long-form pieces anymore - and
how he had won a few prestigious
prizes, which he rattled off - but
his magazine still had gone bust.

As Brad spews, Ananya takes a big GULP from her drink.

INT. THE DRUID - NIGHT 100

Ananya and Brad sit at the booth with her friends. As Maya
and the other STUDENTS laugh and chat, Brad continues to
monologue his life story for Ananya.

NARRATOR
He talked about Craig Fisher and
his other college friends and how
they had sold out and gotten rich
and how they didn’t even invite him
to their milestone events anymore
even though he had been the heart
and soul of their group. Brad may
have failed in their eyes, but at

And even though his consulting non-

he still felt he had done some real
good with it.

BRAD
Maybe if I were more in the field -

people that we’re helping - but I
just feel kind of disconnected...

On Ananya - she is silent, but there’s visible contempt in
her eyes.

NARRATOR
Ananya just listened, saying
nothing, taking him in. Finally,
Brad became so self-conscious, he
couldn’t stand it anymore.

Brad, suddenly embarrassed, blurts...

ANANYA
Why are you competing at all?

BRAD
It’s the way this world is.

ANANYA
From my point of view - you
competing with your friends from

He pictured his friends in their
private, anxious moments. No one
is immune to pain.

Jason nervously cracks his knuckles.

EXT. TUFTS CAMPUS - DAY 125
Brad walks, then stops to look at...

.+.a MEMORIAL PLAQUE, commemorating a departed University
President.

NARRATOR
Brad’s thoughts then turned to
death. The great equalizer.

Brad studies the memorial, closely.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA STUDIES OFFICE - DAY 126

DIPLOMAS and DEGREES for “ROBERT CONNOR” have been placed
into various boxes on the shelves to be taken away.

In one box, we SEE a PHOTO of the distinguished, old
PROFESSOR shaking some important person’s hand.

NARRATOR
His professor gone - without a
trace - a brilliant man with a
unique mind - and at the
institution he had given his whole
life to - already replaced.

We SEE now the Female Professor - she types blithely away at
her computer.
INT. BRAD’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY 127
A HOSPICE NURSE tends to Brad’s dying dad.
NARRATOR
He imagined the moment his father
would die - and what his legacy

would vanish.

On a nearby couch, Melanie holds Brad’s hand in hers,
comforting him.

EXT. TUFTS CAMPUS - DAY 128

Brad, deep in thought, sits on the stairs outside the
Admission Office.

NARRATOR
Brad wondered which friend of his
would die first.
EXT. NICK PASCALE’S HOUSE - DAY 129

The after-party for Nick's wedding. A gorgeous sunset.

We SEE Billy Werstler, drinking with his TWO GIRLFRIENDS.

INT. NICK PASCALE’S HOUSE - DAY 130
Craig and Diane have a spirited debate in the kitchen.
Nearby, Jason and his Wife corral their Kids, preparing to
leave.

Nick and his Husband share a sweet kiss by the wedding cake.

EXT. TUFTS CAMPUS - DAY 132
Brad, looking wistful, still sits on the stairs.

what a beautiful, profound thing.

Brad smiles at the sight. He continues to watch them.

NARRATOR
Something felt changed in Brad - he
felt he would never see things the
same again.

Brad looks over...

...the COLLEGE TOUR is returning. Troy is among the group.
He gives Brad a half-wave.

Brad rises and waves back, smiling. Then his CELL PHONE
BUZZES. He takes out his phone.

Ah, I didn’t do anything.

I don’t hate him. I like him.

TROY
You said he was a jerk and you
hated his guts.

BRAD
Nah, he’s a good guy. He’s an old

HOSTESS
Okay, yeah. You’re the first to

the bar or go ahead to the table?

BRAD
I think - just go to the table.

The Hostess leads him toward a small table - right by the
bar. PATRONS mill around. It’s loud.

BRAD
I’m sorry, but is there another
table? It’s just really loud right
here...

HOSTESS
We're fully booked tonight.

BRAD
Well, what about that table?

Brad points to a bigger, empty table in the corner.

BRAD
Well, he sounded stressed. His kid

wrong with her spine.

CRAIG
That sucks. Which one? He has

BRAD
I think I might have offended him.
I thought he had his own jet for
some reason - and I brought it up -
maybe I sounded glib - I don’t
know. But he seemed annoyed that I
accused him of having his own
plane. I felt bad.

CRAIG
He does have a plane.

He’s getting sued. He lost a lot
of money for a lot of powerful
people. He’s running scared. And
there was this brutal take-down
piece in the Times - actually
written by a friend of mine - which
put me in a really awkward
position. It talked about his
lavish lifestyles - the houses in
the Hamptons - the private planes.

BRAD
Oh my god.

CRAIG
Might be why he was a little
sensitive.

BRAD
Oh. I thought... I got it all
wrong, I guess.

CRAIG
Jason's a pillar of society. He’s
a family man. He’s a good dude.
And he’s a total crook.

Craig laughs.

Really?

He’s a thief. And there’s a chance
- albeit slight - he goes to jail.

executive boards, non-profit
