Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.

The sound of car HORNS.
INT. DANNY'S SUBARU OUTBACK. DAY
Danny Meyerowitz, mid-40's, is backing up on the Bowery.
He wears a soft brown leather jacket and shorts. Eliza,
his 18 year old daughter, is flipping channels on the
radio.
ELIZA
I'm really thinking about being
vegetarian again.
Eliza--

DANNY

ELIZA
Do you realize, eating meat
is worse than driving an SUV
for a year.

DANNY
Eliza, am I fitting?
A car honks.
DANNY
I'm parking asshole!
(twisting the wheel)
I can't believe that's true.
ELIZA
It's true, Dad.
Podcast.

I'll send you the

DANNY
I don't think I'm fitting.
ELIZA
I'm telling you. It's a big thing
we can do for the environment.
DANNY
Let's look it up. But not while
I'm pulling THIS maneuver.
He turns the wheel dramatically.
followed by a thud.

There's a scraping sound

ELIZA
It’s too small a space.

Shit!

DANNY

He shifts back into drive and pulls out into traffic.
horns.

DANNY
(to the car behind him)
What?!
Eliza fiddles with the radio, looking for a song.
DANNY
Go back to the Mets game.
ELIZA
It's a commercial.
DANNY
I splurged and got the satellite.
She lands on "Head to Toe" by Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam.
Ooh, nice.

DANNY
Turn it up.

Eliza turns up the song.
DANNY
"Head to toe --"
(cutting himself off)
I put this on a tape for you when
you were like twelve.
ELIZA
(mildly interested)
Cool.
Danny looks over his shoulder, realizes something, and hits
the wheel in frustration.
DANNY
Shit, was that...was that a spot?
ELIZA
(looking back)
Yeah, he's taking it.
DANNY
How did I miss that?
Fucking shit.

ELIZA
Let's go around.

3
DANNY
We've been around. I'm going to
try further East.
(an idea)
There should be an App for
parking. Is there an App for
parking?
ELIZA
They're working on it.
(re: the street they're on)
This is all No Parking.
DANNY
How did I do this wrong?
ELIZA
It's OK, Dad. Why don't we just
garage it?
Do you
garage
garage
That's

DANNY
know how much it is to
it around here? If we
it, you can't go to college.
why.

ELIZA
(smiling)
I'll pay half.
DANNY
I'm not taking your money.
(sighs)
What's the matter with me?
usually very good at this.
It's OK--

I know.

I'm

ELIZA

DANNY
I'm an extremely good
parker. I have a real eye
for it.

ELIZA

DANNY
Now, I'm over-thinking it.
I'm getting gun-shy.

Sweating, he wrestles with his jacket trying to take it
off. He drives while doing this.
ELIZA
Dad, wait until we’re stopped.
DANNY
I’m hot, it’s interfering
with my mobility--

ELIZA
Let me help you then.

4
She leans over and helps him take it off.
DANNY
(looking in the rear-view
mirror)
Are these the same people that
were behind us?
ELIZA
I don't know.

DANNY
(re: his jacket)
Keep it right-side up, my
wallet’s in there.

He turns the song down.
DANNY
The song was distracting.
ELIZA
It's too good!
DANNY
(half smiling)
It is too good.
They stop at a light.

Danny gazes outside.

DANNY
(musing)
There's so much construction in
Manhattan. They're just endlessly
building. I used to go dancing
around here. At Danceteria. Me
and your uncle Matthew. Now, it's
all banks.
ELIZA
You guys went dancing together?
DANNY
We went together, we didn't dance
together. For a short time in the
80's we hung out. I had moves,
I'm telling you. Is this a museum
now? Everything's glass.
ELIZA
Do you like the photographer, Cindy
Sherman? Marcus and me went to the
Cindy Sherman show at MOMA last
week.
They start moving.

5
DANNY
(pointedly)
Yes, I like Cindy Sherman.
ELIZA
(confused)
What?
DANNY
I told you about Cindy Sherman
like two years ago.
ELIZA
(shrugs)
I don't remember.
I did!

DANNY
And you had NO interest.

ELIZA
I don't know.
DANNY
When Marcus tells you, suddenly
you listen. I'm telling you, I've
got good recommendations. I mean,
I have a few years on you.
He hits the brakes.

HORNS!

DANNY
Is this a spot?
signs say?

What do these

ELIZA
Um, I'm trying to see.
Another car honks behind them.
DANNY
Quick, Eliza...
Blaring honking.

ELIZA
I find parking signs
confusing. What's today?
Danny swerves back into traffic.

DANNY
This asshole is riding my tail.
ELIZA
I think it was a good space.
DANNY
Can I back up?

6
ELIZA
(looking over her shoulder)
I don't think so.
Horns!
DANNY
Shit! He's on my tail.
to go around.

I've got

ELIZA
We should just garage it.
Son.

DANNY
A. Bitch!

Of.

ELIZA
Stop yelling in the car! He can't
hear you. Only I can hear you.
DANNY
(looking in the rearview)
This is just Nobody Can Fucking
Drive Day.
(horns!)
SHUT THE FUCK-EXT./INT. TOWNHOUSE, LOWER MANHATTAN. DAY
The door opens with a light creak.
DANNY
(softly)
Yoo-hoo. Hello?
Danny carries a duffel bag, holds a suitcase and walks with
a slight limp. Eliza follows behind him.
DANNY
(to Eliza, concerned)
The outer door was ajar. And the
button on the foyer door was
pressed and unlocked.
ELIZA
Something smells weird.
A big poodle leaps up on Danny and Eliza.
Oh wow!

ELIZA
Hello!

HAROLD (O.S.)
Down Bruno! Bruno, down!

Eliza screams.

7
DANNY
Whose dog is this?

Brune!

HAROLD

Harold Meyerowitz, 70's, is bearded, wearing a green polo
shirt with a knit tie and a knee-high work coat. He also
has a red bruise on the side of his face.
ELIZA
(to the dog)
Where did you come from?
HAROLD
Maureen and I bought him from a
very elegant apricot poodle farm
near the country house.
ELIZA
Hi Bruno! Oh, you're crazy,
aren't you?
DANNY
(while hugging his Dad)
Dad, the outer door was left open.
(demonstrating)
And someone pressed the button in
on the foyer door-HAROLD
Maureen is always doing something.
(shouting)
Maureen!
DANNY
I'm telling you, you got to be
careful. It's crazy to leave the
doors open. This isn't the
country.
HAROLD
(to the leaping dog)
Brune!
(to the air)
Maureen!
(to Danny and Eliza)
This house isn't very big, but she
never seems to be able to hear me.
(again)
Maureen!
What?

MAUREEN (O.S.)
HAROLD
Did you leave the front door open?

8
MAUREEN (O.S.)
For the Con Ed guy?
HAROLD
That was three days ago!
He shakes his head, irritated.
DANNY
I'm sorry we're late, we had to
garage the car.
ELIZA
And Dad had to sell me into child
slavery to pay for it.
DANNY
That's basically right.

HAROLD
Did you try East?

DANNY/ELIZA
We did./Twice.
The dog lunges at Danny.
HAROLD
Bruno! He does this elegant
pirouette.
Danny now reacts to the bruise on Harold's face.
DANNY
Dad, what happened?
into a fight?

Did you get

HAROLD
I was walking Bruno in the country
when he lunged for a feral hare in
the brush and I tumbled forward.
Shit.

DANNY
Did you see a doctor?

HAROLD
I'm fine. My joke is, you should
see the other dog.
He smiles slyly at Eliza.
ELIZA
Good one, Grampa.

9
HAROLD
Maureen won't even walk that path
anymore. She was mauled by a
buck.
A buck?

DANNY
In the Berkshires?

HAROLD
A male deer.
Really?

DANNY
HAROLD
Maybe it was a big dog or a small
boy. In her indomitable way she
survived with just a nasty
raspberry on her knee, but her
wallet was gone.
He takes Eliza's hand and leads her further inside. They
pass the living room where the TV is on the baseball game.
HAROLD
The Mets just relinquished the
lead.
DANNY
Shit, it was tied when we
were in the car.

HAROLD
Collins shouldn’t have left
Syndergaard in. He was
clearly tiring.

Jean, 50's, rises from the couch, watching the game.
Danny's older sister.

She's

JEAN
I could tell Dad wanted to say Hi
to you guys by himself.
DANNY
(startles)
Hey. When'd you get here?
HAROLD (O.S.)
Your sister is here.
Her hair is graying and she doesn't dye it. She wears a
blazer with an abstract pin on the lapel and big hanging
earrings and glasses. She dresses how she probably dressed
twenty-five years ago.

Couple hours ago.
showing up late.

Thanks for

DANNY
Sorry, we were--

JEAN
I made cookies but I stepped
in dog shit.

She hugs Eliza and Danny.
JEAN
I like your jacket.
Thanks.

ELIZA
I like your pin.

JEAN
Are you excited for college
tomorrow?

ELIZA
I really can't wait.
JEAN
Dad keeps saying he wishes he
hadn’t retired now so that you
could take his class. If that’s
even allowed at Bard.
ELIZA
I couldn’t make sculpture,
that’s too intimidating.

DANNY
She's very excited which I'm
trying not to take
personally. I'm bad with
transitions.

JEAN
You don't leave the house.
are no transitions.
(whispers to Danny)
Maureen's plastered.
HAROLD
(yelling up the stairs)
Maureen, every one is here!
down!
(to the group)
She's making shark.
ELIZA
I don't think I've ever had
shark.

There

Come

HAROLD
Maureen's a real gourmand.

JEAN
(meeting Eliza's eyes)
Well, you're in for a treat.

11
HAROLD
(loud whisper to Danny)
Maureen's been sober for six
weeks.
Oh, OK.

DANNY
HAROLD
I tell her, I don't like you when
you drink. She becomes a
different person.
(to Eliza)
I made her a deal, I told her, if
you stop drinking, we'll get a
dog.
INT. DINING ROOM
CLOSE: A bowl of bouillabaisse. All the clam and mussel
shells are still closed shut. A fork picks through the
uncooked slab of shark.
HAROLD (O.S.)
This is very handsome shellfish,
Maureen.
Eliza makes a face.
MAUREEN
The Dad says you're going to study
film at college.
The family sits around a wooden table. Maureen, 50's,
looks plastered. She wears an Indian patterned caftan and
a big bulky necklace she probably got at a craft fair.
Yeah.

ELIZA
MAUREEN
That seems to be what everybody is
doing these days. I think the Dad
hoped you’d follow in his
footsteps and take sculpture-HAROLD
No, I think it’s good she’s doing
her own thing. Since Clarence had
his stroke and I retired, the art
department at Bard has really
suffered.

12
DANNY
She's quite a good editor.
Danny is trying to pry open a clam shell. Eliza moves the
food around on her plate. Harold eats quickly and messily.
HAROLD
So, now we have a sculptor and a
filmmaker in the family.
ELIZA
(re: Danny)
And a musician.
HAROLD
And an accountant which sounds
uninteresting, but Matthew's in
fact the only one in the family
who's figured out how to make
money. Sign of the times.
He laughs at his own remark.
HAROLD
I would have thought we'd have had
more artists in this family.
ELIZA
What about Dad?
Eliza looks over to Danny, who listens closely, perhaps
waiting to be mentioned himself.
DANNY
(finally)
I'm artistic.
HAROLD
Matthew showed interest in fine
art and Danny had musical talent.
But Matthew was also talented
musically and a wonderful mimic.
He looks at Jean and hesitates.
HAROLD
Jean, you showed interest in
photography.
JEAN
At Montessori, yeah. In my office
at Xerox, I'm known as the resident
auteur. I make funny movies for my
co-worker's birthdays.

13
ELIZA
They’re really good.
Danny finally breaks open his clam shell. He meets eyes
with Eliza. She slowly shakes her head at him: Don't do
it. He drops the shell back into the bowl, nodding, OK.
MAUREEN
We have no idea what Jean does at
Xerox.
JEAN
I’m a facilities manager for
special--

MAUREEN
When was the last job you
had, Danny?

ELIZA
(helping out her Dad)
Those piano lessons-DANNY
Well...except for the piano
lessons--

ELIZA
--and there was a gig at
Beefsteak Charlies.

DANNY
I haven't really worked in
a...since Eliza was born...
HAROLD
Danny was a house-husband. But
now with the separation, he's
going to have to get a job. You
can't take alimony, that's not
right.
MAUREEN
What will you do for money?
DANNY
Well, we just sold the apartment
and we'll split that.
(reassuringly placing his
hand on Eliza's back)
Karen...Karen is getting an
apartment in Ditmas and I'm...I'll
be staying here for a little, of
course, while I figure it out.
Thank you, again.
He looks to his Dad for some acknowledgement.
none.

He gets

14
MAUREEN
While you're staying here, would
you please go through all the
boxes upstairs and take whatever
papers and posters you want from
your childhood.
HAROLD
(to Eliza)
Maureen is taking a fancy
trip to Easter Island on
Monday with a group.

MAUREEN
And when I'm back, we're
going to start throwing
things away.

DANNY
We don’t really have
anything here.

JEAN
We lived in Queens with our
mother.

DANNY
Yeah, it’s mostly Matthew's stuff,
but OK.
HAROLD
(excitedly)
Matthew's coming out from the
coast in a few weeks. He
corresponded with me about meeting
for lunch.
Danny looks up, surprised.
Matt is?

DANNY
Danny absentmindedly puts some shark in his mouth and then
takes it right back out.
MAUREEN
He has some wealthy clients who
are coming here on Sunday to look
at the Dad's work.
DANNY
Matt does?
HAROLD
Apparently they're both admirers
of mine.
MAUREEN
We never hear from him and then
suddenly...poof!

15
HAROLD
That's not true, he and I
correspond quite frequently.
ELIZA
He texts with me.
They all look at Eliza.

Danny frowns.

DANNY
You guys text? About what?
ELIZA
(shrugs)
I don't know. Things.
Life.

DANNY
Maybe I'll try to see him
when he's here.

HAROLD
He's only here for a day to see a
client and he wants to see me
during that time. Eliza, have
more shark. Maureen, give my
granddaughter more shark!
Maureen heaps more shark on Eliza's plate.
MAUREEN
You kids don't eat.
Jean starts clearing. Maureen and Danny help her. Eliza
remains with her grandfather, pretending to eat her shark.
We MOVE between the adjacent kitchen and the dining room.
JEAN
It's amazing how much Matthew's
clients make when you think about
what a teacher or nurse earns-HAROLD
I think I would have had greater
success if I had been more
fashionable.
MAUREEN
Well, you were always out of step
with the times.
HAROLD
That's true, I was a vanguard.
L.J. Shapiro said that about me.
Jean reenters from the kitchen bringing out coffee cups.

16
JEAN
You know L.J.'s having a
retrospective at MOMA.
HAROLD
(didn't know)
Is he? L.J. was always very
political. He's not untalented,
but he's a very skillful operator.
MAUREEN (O.S.)
You didn't play the game.
HAROLD
You know L.J. and I showed
together at Paula Cooper in the
late 60's. And believe it or not,
I was the headliner.
Danny, still distracted by discussion of Matthew says to
Jean:
DANNY
Do you think I should e-mail Matt
about his visit?
Why not?

JEAN
DANNY
I don't want to be presumptuous.
JEAN
He's your brother, Dan.
DANNY
(shrugs)
Half.
Maureen reenters.
MAUREEN
Isn't that when the Whitney bought
a piece of yours?
HAROLD
Yes. They were going to buy more
work too, but Bernie, my dealer at
the time didn't like the deal. I
probably shouldn't have listened
to him.

17
DANNY
(continuing to Jean)
I don't know, he didn't respond
the last time I reached out.
Harold pries open another clam and eats it.
disgusted face to herself.

Eliza makes a

JEAN
When I called and wrote the
Whitney about it, they couldn't
find it.
HAROLD
It's there.
JEAN
They can't find it.
HAROLD
Jean, damnit, they have the work!
JEAN
(chastised)
OK, OK...
Jean takes Eliza's full plate, rescuing her from eating
anything more, and says in her ear:
It's lost.

JEAN
INT. HALLWAY
We hear family conversation from the other room. Danny
turns the knob on the bathroom door. It opens and Maureen
immediately comes out, wearing rose tinted glasses, but
where you can see her eyes.
DANNY
Oh...sorry.
Maureen mumbles something.

Danny enters.

INT. BATHROOM
Danny flushes. A strange rattling sound. He lifts up the
back of the toilet. Inside, bouncing around the chain, are
several small, pint-size liquor bottles.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Danny and Eliza sit at an upright piano.

Danny plays the

DANNY
This is a Meyerowitz/Meyerowitz
composition.
ELIZA
We wrote it when I was nine.
CUT TO: CLOSE on a book of Harold's work.
HAROLD (O.S.)
The work looks stunning all
together like this. Danny, you
made this?
Harold sits with Jean on a old corduroy couch. They eat
cookies Jean made. Harold hands the book to Maureen.
MAUREEN
(reading)
Harold Meyerowitz: A
Retrospective.

DANNY
Jean and I did it, yes.

JEAN
You send in the pictures and they
make it for you.
DANNY
(from the piano)
Oh, Dad, Jean and I spoke with a
woman at the museum at Bard-Danny looks at Jean who nods for him to continue.
HAROLD
Is that Hilma Federman?
DANNY
Hilma, yes. And there's some
interest at Bard in doing a show-MAUREEN
That's the least they can do for
you after all those years you've
given them.
Maureen randomly clears a plate and leaves the room.
DANNY
I think with Eliza going this fall
and your history there as a
teacher, we have a good shot--

19
HAROLD
Danny, make sure Hilma sees the
book. A retrospective at this
point would be a real feather in
my cap. And I think bring
attention to the new work.
Jean looks at Danny, who stops playing.
DANNY
Well, the thing is Dad...it
would be part of a group
show.

JEAN
Bard Faculty.

HAROLD
A group show? No. That's
essentially an insult. I think
Hilma's angry because I voted
against her chairmanship. Tell
Hilma, No.
DANNY
Hilma hasn't offered it yet.
HAROLD
Well, when she does, tell her, No.
Danny continues playing.

Eliza and Danny finish the song.

JEAN
That sounded great.
good, Eliza.

You've gotten

ELIZA
(putting her head on
Danny's shoulder)
I had a good teacher.
EXT. HAROLD'S HOUSE, BLEECKER STREET. NIGHT
Eliza waits with Danny outside the house.
DANNY
Is shark bad or was that bad
shark?
ELIZA
Dad, it was raw! The rice was
hard, the shell fish was closed.
Danny removes a piece of trash that's blown up on the walk.
He walks uneasily over to a trash can and chucks it.

20
ELIZA
Dad, your limp is worse.
DANNY
It's always worse after I've been
sitting. I need to stretch it.
ELIZA
Please see someone about it.
DANNY
I have an appointment with an
acupuncturist on Tuesday.
ELIZA
Someone real please.
He looks at her.

Tears run down her face.

DANNY
I'm telling you, you're going to
meet a lot of wonderful,
interesting new people. Or I
imagine you will as I didn't make
it more than a month at college
because I liked drugs so much.
ELIZA
I'm going to miss you and Mom.
I know.

DANNY
We'll miss you too.

ELIZA
I still haven't wrapped my mind
around it. You not being
together.
DANNY
We wouldn't have made it this long
if it weren't for you.
ELIZA
(wiping her face)
That's a lot of responsibility.
DANNY
You know what I mean. We don't
get along when it's just us. I'm
sorry I don't get to drive you,
but your mom won that one.
It's OK.

ELIZA
She's a good driver.

He hugs her.

21
DANNY
Remind her when you're going up
tomorrow, the Taconic is a speed
trap. There are cops everywhere.
I will.

ELIZA
DANNY
And I'll be up there whenever
you're ready for me.
ELIZA
Will you be OK here?
DANNY
Yeah, it'll be nice to spend time
with Dad while Maureen’s away. You
know I didn't get a lot of time
with him growing up. After he left
my mom and married Julia, and they
had Matt...we didn’t see so much of
him. It's an opportunity to get
closer now.
ELIZA
It's nice you and Jean are getting
him this show.
DANNY
I know it's just a college show,
but I think it could really put
him back on the map. The work is
good and deserves more exposure.
A car has pulled up at the corner.

A bearded guy, 18,

DANNY
Hey Marcus!
MARCUS
Hey, Danny.
DANNY
You're a truly wonderful girl.

You've been a great Dad.

Well, I think I still am.

I didn't mean it that way.
Danny hugs Eliza. He's crying now too.

Harold shows a couple, Brian and James, 40's, both sharply
dressed, his work. Maureen and Danny hover nearby.
BRIAN
This one is interesting.
MAUREEN
I think it's a masterpiece.
HAROLD
It's intended as a sort of sequel
to Gilded Halfwing.
JAMES
That's the squiggly one outside
Lincoln Center?
MAUREEN
Yes, Gilded Halfwing.
HAROLD
That's probably my most well known
work, it has a young man's energy,
but I like to think the later work
is richer and more interesting.
JAMES
When Matthew told me that was
yours, I was like, I walk by that
all the time. We're on Central
Park West now, but have been
looking for the right place
downtown.
James wanders into an adjacent bathroom.

23
MAUREEN
Show them the wood structures.
HAROLD
Yes, I've been working in wood
recently. Danny, give me a hand.
Danny indicates a stacked metal structure tucked in the
back.
DANNY
How about this one with the red?
I always loved this one.
HAROLD
No, not that one.

That's a minor

Danny and Harold lug a couple of pieces into the center of
the room. Brian wanders to the window and looks outside.
BRIAN
How's the noise in this area?
DANNY
It gets very loud. All the
tourists.
MAUREEN
Only on weekends.
James tests the water on the tap and the toilet flush.
Danny pokes his head around the corner finding James
inspecting the fixtures.
DANNY
The art's over here.
JAMES
Yes, great.
He hurries back to find Harold with five new pieces.
HAROLD
It's largely intuitive really and
in its way, a return to the old
masters. I think I'm doing the
best work of my life right now.
But that's just one man's opinion.
INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM
Maureen prepares lunch.

Harold watches the game on TV.

24
MAUREEN
I found Brian very attractive.
He's baby-faced but sinewy like an
old lover of mine, Willem Dafoe.
James has very firm calves.
HAROLD
They were very enthusiastic about
the work.
Danny enters from the other room.

He looks annoyed.

DANNY
Are they interested in the house
or the art?
HAROLD
(considered)
I think, the art.

MAUREEN
(walking past him)
Both.

DANNY
What do you mean, both?
Harold watches the TV.
Danny follows her.

Maureen walks into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN
DANNY
Maureen, what do you mean, both?
MAUREEN
Per Matthew, they're interested in
purchasing all of the work, some of
the furniture, as well as the
house.
DANNY
(alarmed)
The house? What...what did you
tell him?
MAUREEN
That we're open to exploring
it.

HAROLD (O.S.)
(re: the game)
The Mets are staging a
comeback. They've got first
and third with no one out.

DANNY
(suddenly agitated)
You're thinking of selling the
house? Why?

25
MAUREEN
It's very expensive to keep this
place up. And we're spending more
time at the country house now.
DANNY
But the country's yours.
MAUREEN
Well, I had it before we were
married, but it's ours.
Everything is ours now.
INT. LIVING ROOM
She heads toward the living room. Danny limps after her.
Harold jerks back and forth with the movement of the game.
DANNY
(concerned)
You're selling ALL of the art?
Why? Dad...I think...do you want
to sell?
HAROLD
Oh come on! Cabrera just grounded
into a double play.
DANNY
Matt set this up?
HAROLD
(distracted by the game)
I told him it was a family
discussion.
DANNY
I think it is! I don't think you
should sell AT ALL. I'm telling
you.
HAROLD
I didn't expect you to get so
upset about it.
I am.

DANNY
I am upset about it!

MAUREEN
Why do you care?

DANNY
(suddenly emotional)
I don't know. We've lived here
for years.
HAROLD
You haven't. This is where
Matthew grew up. You lived in
Queens with your mother.
DANNY
I lived here for a year when I was
sixteen.
(hesitates)
Your studio is here... They want
ALL the art work? I mean, Dad,
with a show here or there, your
work might become valuable.
HAROLD
That is true.
DANNY
I say, No!
He hits his hand down on a table for emphasis.
HAROLD
Everyone in the family will be
consulted before we sell anything.
DANNY
Matthew isn't here, you know.
Matthew isn't in the house NOW.
(wiping his eyes)
It's a Meyerowitz tradition, this
house.
MAUREEN
(hurt)
I guess I wouldn't know about
that.
Maureen storms out of the room.

We hear a door slam.

DANNY
I didn't mean it like that.
HAROLD
She gets sensitive about these
things. She feels like an
outsider and she doesn't have kids
of her own.

Yes, all on one tape: Videodrome,

incredibly sexy, was quite a deft

HAROLD
Try Matthew.
Jean and Danny meet eyes.
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN: Eliza's movie entitled PAGINA MAN.

It's about a girl wanting to get laid before leaving for
college, played by Eliza. She's partially nude in one
scene. Gets fucked from behind in another. Pisses in a
urinal in another.
ELIZA IN THE MOVIE
(wearing a cape and mask)
I've got a vagina and a penis.
Call me Pagina Man!
It does have a sense of humor, though and style. But
before it's over: Danny hits the space bar, pausing it.
DANNY
I'm going to watch this first,

Wow.

That was a hard R.

It's handsomely shot and shows

(to Danny)
Shhh...
(to L.J. on the phone)
What's that?
He pantomimes for Danny to turn the game down.
Harold angrily motions to do it further.

Danny does.

HAROLD
He was a talented kid when he took
my class, sure...Yeah, I'd think
he'd be an able assistant...OK...
Oh, you know, doing the
work...Bard has come to me about a
show... What's the news
there?...Oh, I didn't know, how
are you doing?
Danny texts Eliza: Yo.
CLOSE ON THE PHONE: It goes through blue and Delivered.
The dots come up as if something is being written back.
Danny brightens.
HAROLD
Maureen says they're fete-ing you
at MOMA...You and Tim
Burton!...Right, Matisse and
Picasso too, sure...
Danny waits.
CLOSE ON THE PHONE: The dots disappear.

Nothing.

Danny, discouraged, puts his phone away.
HAROLD
Let's get a lunch one of these
days, you still in the West
Village?... Brooklyn?...Or to your
opening?... I'm coming if you
invite me...Next Friday...Yes, I
think I can come. Although I've
boycotted MOMA since they've
started doing these theme park

Instantly back to the game.

That was a strike!

Turn it up.

HAROLD
He says he had a prostate surgery,
I didn't know about.
DANNY
And I really like his work.
HAROLD
The early, experimental work is
terrific. You know, he and I
showed together at Paula Cooper
back in the late 60’s.
DANNY
Uh huh. I love the 80's stuff.
Those bears.
HAROLD
You liked the bears? Hmm. I
guess the bears. You know, back
then, I was the headliner.

I'd like to come if that's all
right. It would be a real treat
for me.

I'll see about getting you a

OK, whatever.
INT. KITCHEN
Danny gets up and leaves the room. We FOLLOW him into the
kitchen. He's trying to suppress his anger and hurt. He
opens the fridge and takes out a carton of orange juice and
pours himself a glass. He drinks and spits it across the
kitchen floor.

32

Oh God!

DANNY
Harold comes in.
DANNY
Your orange juice is expired which
I just realized is possible.
HAROLD
Do you have black tie?
DANNY
(can't hide his pleasure)
I have a herring-bone blazer and
slacks with a hummus stain on the
fly?
HAROLD
I think we might have an extra
belonging to Maureen’s late exhusband.
INT. MOMA LOBBY. DAY
They enter the lobby, both in outdated -- and in the case
of Danny, ill-fitted -- tuxedos. Ahead: a spirited crowd
mingles around the exhibit. A few people in suits,
otherwise everyone is dressed pretty casually.
DANNY
Dad, no one is in tuxes.
HAROLD
I think I see a couple of people.
DANNY
I don't see ANYBODY.
Harold and Danny reach a table where two young, opaque
pretty women consult iPads.
DANNY
We're Harold Meyerowitz.
GALLERY GIRL
(checks her iPad)
OK, you're on the list for the
public viewing which starts in
forty-five minutes. Right now,
this is a private viewing.

Tell her to tell L.J. we're-DANNY
Dad, she can hear everything
you're saying. Let's just wait
for forty-five minutes-HAROLD
I'm going to go home.
DANNY
Come on, Dad-Harold pulls away from Danny and hurries toward the
revolving doors. Danny sighs.
DANNY
My father is Harold Meyerowitz, he
was a contemporary of L.J.'s.
Also a sculptor.
The Gallery Girl shrugs.
DANNY
Big night, huh?
Danny?!

L.J. (O.S.)
L.J., late 60's, excitedly approaches from behind. He's in
a white tank top with a tailored blazer over it and suit
pants. A scarf tied around his ankle.

34
Blue tinted glasses on his head. He walks over with Glenn
Twitchell, 60's, in a suit, the MOMA curator.
L.J.
(to the Gallery Girl)
This guy giving you trouble?
She laughs heartily.
L.J.
(hugging Danny)
Danny, you were so damned young
the last time I saw you.
DANNY
Yeah, last time I saw you was at
those Chinatown dinners you guys
would throw. Those were great, I
was living with Dad that year.
Glenn excuses himself and goes inside, greeted by guests.
L.J.
It was you and Matthew. Always
playing music. Your Dad was with
Julia, I was with Maya. Before
the divorces!
DANNY
Well, before his second divorce,
he'd already divorced my mom, but
yeah, those were fun dinners.
L.J.
(confused by the tuxedo)
Are you going somewhere after
this?
DANNY
(muttering)
Dad said it was black tie.
L.J.
You know, Loretta's here.

She is?
L.J.
Yeah, she's floating around this
rat-fuck somewhere.

Oh...I'll look for her.

One of my

Danny looks around: Harold is now walking back toward them.
Harold smiles broadly.
HAROLD
Your hair's darker every time I
see you.
Harold and L.J. embrace.

L.J. holds him warmly.

L.J.
(re: the tuxes)
Look at you. You guys are so
cute.
(taking Harold's arm)
Come have a drink. We're having
Zubrowka. I just reread The
Razor's Edge -- it's Larry
Durrell's drink.
HAROLD
I find Maugham to be skillful
without being an artist, but I'll
sip a red wine, if you have.
L.J.
It's the Museum of Modern Art.
Dammit, they have everything.
Harold follows L.J. into the party. Danny starts to follow
but they're quickly swallowed up by the crowds.

OK.

DANNY
(to himself)
INT. MOMA RECEPTION AREA
Danny, again, assesses the very non-tuxedo crowd, and
attempts to wander the premises as unself-consciously as
possible. He nervously hums an indecipherable tune.
Amongst the sculptures, and old high 8 video of a young
girl (Loretta) on monitors, he sees a woman, 40's, in a
simple, elegant dress.

Loretta?

She has a genuinely open,

LORETTA
I didn't know you were

DANNY
I came with my Dad.
LORETTA
(frowns, re: the tux)
Are you going somewhere after
this?
DANNY
(here we go again)
No...no...
LORETTA
Why are you so dressed up?
DANNY
I don't know.
(so annoyed at Dad)
I don't fucking know!
(laughs)
I don't know.
LORETTA
How is your Dad?
DANNY
He's with your dad now which makes
him happy. L.J.'s good for him,
he knows how to have fun. His
wife, you know, Maureen-LORETTA
I think I met her once at a
Dia show--

DANNY
She's in Easter Island so
I'm staying with him now--

LORETTA
Oh, that's nice of you.

37
DANNY
This is her dead ex-husband’s tux.
She drinks and I worry he's
lonely.
LORETTA
Yeah, that's hard, that stuff.
You know my mom struggled with a
prescription thing for a while
when we were kids. But she's
great now, married again...and you
saw Dad... yeah...life. Blah!
(grabs his arms and
shakes him
affectionately)
Danny Meyerowitz!
DANNY
(blushing)
I'm telling ya.
Loretta undoes his badly knotted tie so it hangs open.
LORETTA
Wow, this was tied like a tennis
shoe. There: More Sinatra.
Yeah.

DANNY
Dad's my Sammy.

Loretta laughs.
INT. MOMA GALLERY ROOM
Harold has a red wine now. L.J. drinks his Zubrowka and is
approached throughout by well-wishers.
HAROLD
The work looks good. I don't know
that the presentation is helping.
L.J.
You think? Yeah, I think some of
the bears are not well served.
HAROLD
In a sense, the work is more
intimate than the space. But,
hey, you're on a streak.
L.J.
(good naturedly)
Don't say that! Streaks end.

Sigourney Weaver says Hi to L.J..
L.J.
Sigourney Weaver, this is Harold
Meyerowitz.
SIGOURNEY
Hi, I'm Sigourney.
HAROLD
I'm Harold.
SIGOURNEY
(to L.J.)
The work is beautiful. It's
startling. Congratulations.
She moves on.

L.J. turns back to Harold.

L.J.
How are you, old man?
Maureen?

How's

HAROLD
Bard has approached me about a
show.
L.J.
Are you still teaching there?
HAROLD
I'm retired, but my grand-daughter
just started as a freshman. She's
making movies.
L.J.
That's what they're all doing now.
I say, don't teach 'em what we do,
there's no damn money in that.
HAROLD
Well, you seem to have found a
way.
Glenn Twitchell, the curator, approaches, his back to
Harold.
GLENN
I hope it's OK, I invited
Sigourney to the dinner
afterwards.

L.J.
Of course. I've known
Sigourney for twenty years.
Glenn, you remember-Good, good.

GLENN
I hear a rave tomorrow from
Michael and Twitter has been
almost entirely glowing.
GLENN
We're going to have a good

Harold sips his wine and smiles along, although he's not
part of the conversation.
L.J.
Glenn Twitchell, Harold
Meyerowitz. Harold, Glenn's the
curator here now.

Nice to meet you.

Harold says oddly

HAROLD
How good are we?
L.J.

He's mobbed by more guests.

Harold sinks back.

INT. MOMA RECEPTION AREA
CUT TO: The old high 8 video work on a monitor. A young
girl with frizzy hair runs down an Upper West Side street.
It's cut in a fragmentary, stuttering way.
DANNY
I remember you like that.
LORETTA
Yeah, I used to have mixed
feelings about being part of Dad's
art, but now I kind of love it.
You know, he dedicated the
catalogue to me.
DANNY
It's definitely a cool thing.
This whole thing is really cool.
It's special for me, I don't go
out like this generally.
LORETTA
How's your family and everything?
DANNY
Well...Karen and I are splitting
up. Split up.
LORETTA
Oh shit, sorry. I'm doing the
same thing.
DANNY
(pleased)
Really!
LORETTA
Yeah, but it's good. He...he's a
good guy but can't get out of his
own way. But my girls are
handling it so great. How are you
doing?
DANNY
Oh, fine. You know, Karen and I
stayed together until Eliza went
to school, but also I just didn't
want to do what my Dad did, you
know? Failed marriages and...you
ever worry we're doing the same
thing as them?

41
LORETTA
Oh, but we're so different, Dan.
DANNY
You think?
LORETTA
So different. We were raised like
animals. We were feral! My worry
is that we're too different.
We're too close to our kids, don't
you think? Parents shouldn't be
best friends with their kids. I
mean, I don't think my girls will
ever move out!
Danny laughs.
DANNY
Yeah, I secretly hoped that about
Eliza, but unfortunately she seems
pretty healthy in that area.
Loretta laughs. Danny smiles broadly, pleased she's so
engaged. Suddenly:
HAROLD (O.S.)
I want to go.
Danny startles.
Dad--

Harold is right behind him.
DANNY

LORETTA
Harold!
(identifying herself)
Loretta!
Loretta hugs him and kisses him warmly on the cheek.
HAROLD
Oh, Loretta. Hi. I didn't
recognize you at first.
(to Danny)
I'm going.
GUEST
(re: the video)
There's that little girl I keep
seeing running down 79th Street!
Loretta is swarmed by more well-wishers.

42
HAROLD
(to Danny)
I want to go.
DANNY
(trying to keep it light)
Just a few more minutes, roomie?
HAROLD
I'm leaving.
Harold hurries toward the EXIT. Danny looks at Loretta,
who is distracted by the bigger group-Danny gazes toward the EXIT where his father is wrestling
open one of the big glass doors. Danny hesitates.
DANNY
Um, Loretta-She doesn't hear him.
Loretta!

He politely waits for a moment.

DANNY
She smiles at him, still talking to the group.
DANNY
(strangely pantomiming
leaving)
I have to go!
LORETTA
Oh, no. You sure? You guys
aren't staying for the dinner?
DANNY
I don't think we were invited to-LORETTA
(to her friends)
Excuse me for a second.
She touches Danny's arm, her face open and welcoming.
DANNY
Yeah, I better...
LORETTA
(to Danny)
OK. Well...
DANNY
Great to see you.

He's old.

So great.

She kisses him on the cheek.

I know you like the bears but it's
a reshuffling of obnoxious cliches,
like listening to music played
slightly off-key.
DANNY
I didn't get to see it.
HAROLD
And the video work is embarrassing - I've never forgiven L.J. for
using Loretta in those pieces. You
don't do that to a child. And it's
a disturbing commentary on the
culture that truly ordinary work,
made mostly by his assistants, gets
reverent reviews by critics who
ought to know better. He's a
talented, pretentious enigma.

I met Sigourney Weaver who was very

He looks for a cab.

Danny shrugs.
HAROLD
You've essentially never worked in
your life.
Danny nods.

yourself.
Danny nods.
HAROLD
Do you ever think about playing
music again?
Danny shrugs.
HAROLD
Maureen will be back next Thursday
and you should think about where
you're going to live. I mean, you
can stay a while longer, but-INT. HAROLD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
A clock reads: 9:40. Danny, still in his tux, walks by the
piano and plays the opening chords of Van Halen's Jump.
He eats a sandwich and makes up the living room couch with
a sheet and pillow. Harold appears in the doorway. He
holds up black Vuarnet sunglasses.
HAROLD
Maureen wanted me to remind you to
go through the boxes and things
upstairs because we're going to
start throwing things away. You
might want these sunglasses.
DANNY
Those are Matthew's.
HAROLD
I'm letting him know too.

DANNY
Yeah, for a little while.

You look tired.
Matt's phone rings.
MATT
I can’t sleep on the red-eye.
RANDY
Let's get you a coffee.
Matt checks his phone.

Dad.

RANDY
I’m glad you’re here, Matt.
MATT
I’m not leaving until we’ve
figured this out-Matt doesn't answer his phone and they step into a shell of
a room that's sealed off with plastic. More workmen.
Hammering. Plaster dust drifts down on them.
RANDY
(marveling)
There are different people here
every day.
The coffee machine sits alone atop a folding table. Randy
pours the beans into the grinder and presses the button.
RANDY
(shouting over the
grinding)
How's your kid?

51
MATT
Good. I'm in a fight with my wife
right now, but...
(re: the sheet)
Randy, I don't want to sound
alarmist, but you're not going to
be able to sustain your lifestyle,
if things continue like this.
Randy frowns like a child.
MATT
And you're not going on tour any
time soon -Randy hands Matt a coffee.
smiles.
Right?

RANDY

Matt sips the coffee and

It's nice.

MATT

RANDY
It's my own espresso bean. SEE,
I'm doing everything I can to make
a buck. The coffee will pay for
the pool!
MATT
That might be too much pressure to
put on the coffee-Matt's phone rings again.

He looks at it.

MATT
Here’s what we’re going to do.
We’re going to get you the pool.
Yes!

RANDY
MATT
But not this year. We’re going to
rent out the bottom floor which is
zoned commercial anyway and we’ll
get a tenant for the second floor.
RANDY
But can’t I afford--

MATT
The income from the rentals
will cover the real estate
taxes and you’ll live on the
top two floors in the
meantime. Everything else
you can have.

MATT
Let me just...
(answering)
Hello?
RANDY
Coffee makes me so happy.
A saw screams loudly in the other room.

EXT. WILLIAMSBURG RESTAURANT. INTERCUT
Harold stands outside a restaurant. He wears a camel
colored blazer with a black turtleneck and baggy slacks. A
denim flat cap on his head. He holds a poster roll and
some envelopes and folders under his arm. He still has a
slight bruise on the side of his face from his fall.
They're jack-hammering in the street next to him.
HAROLD
They won't seat me without you!
MATT
Where are you?!
HAROLD
I'm standing outside the place.
MATT
You're forty-five minutes early.
HAROLD
There are many available tables.
The guy was a real jerk.
MATT
We have a reservation, did you say
my name?
HAROLD
I said my name.
MATT
Well, let me finish up here and
we'll figure it out.
HAROLD
How long are you going to be?
MATT
I'll be there at one when we said
we'd meet.

53
HAROLD
Well, hurry up. Parking was
easier than I anticipated.
MATT
I'll see you soon!
Matt hangs up. Randy is talking to a guy with an open
notebook. He turns to Matt and says decisively.
RANDY
We won’t do the pool now.
MATT
I think that’s the right decision.
Matt puts his hand on Randy’s shoulder.
RANDY
(re: the phone)
Everything OK?
Totally.

MATT
Lunch with my father.

RANDY
Say no more!
MATT
No, now it's easy. When I was
younger, I was so invested in his
grievances, his anger at the
world. They were mine too. Now,
that I live three thousand miles
away and have a good therapist, my
own kid, a thriving business, I
don't even get angry at him
anymore. It's even just funny
now...
(suddenly having trouble
clearing his throat)
You know what's awesome about
middle age, you now know more than
your parents. You can guide the-(coughing a bit now)
I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm
suddenly, I think it's all this
plaster dust and this coffee-RANDY
(nods)
You need something?

54

Like what?

MATT
Let's see--

RANDY

Randy fishes into his pants-pocket and retrieves two loose
different sized pills. He picks some additional lint out
of his palm.
RANDY
--one brings you up and the other
brings you down, but I'm not
totally certain which is which.
MATT
You have a guess?
RANDY
I haven't worn these pants in a
while.
He hands them to Matt.

Matt puts it in his breast pocket.

RANDY
Thanks, Matt. I don’t have anyone
in my life like you.
EXT. WILLIAMSBURG RESTAURANT
Matthew hurries over to his Dad who has remained outside
the restaurant. The street noise continues.
HAROLD
There's my son.
Hey.

MATT
They hug awkwardly. Harold hands Matt the poster roll and
envelopes and papers and the Vuarnet sunglasses. Matt
frowns.
HAROLD
These are yours. They were in the
upstairs room. Maureen is throwing
things out, I wanted you to have
them.
MATT
(not thrilled to be
carrying them)
Thanks. The Vuarnets are Danny's.
HAROLD
He said they were yours.

55

No.

MATT
You can throw them out.

HAROLD
They're quite fancy.
(hesitates)
Maybe Maureen will use them.
He puts them in his jacket pocket.
MATT
What happened to your face?
HAROLD
We got a new dog, did I tell you?
Maybe?

MATT

HAROLD
Bruno...my charge, we call
him Bruno. Named for the
idiot in Werner Herzog's
Stroczek.

MATT
I've never seen it.
HAROLD
Really? I own the cassette
at home if you want to come
over.

MATT
So, what happened?

HAROLD
He lunged for a deranged hare
taking me in the process.
(beat, sly smile)
You should see the other dog.
MATT
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

HAROLD
It wasn't his fault.

MATT
Shall we go in?
HAROLD
I'm not eating here.
MATT
Because they wouldn't seat
you?
MATT
Let me talk to him--

HAROLD
The guy was very obnoxious.

56
HAROLD
No, let's go somewhere else.
MATT
I only have an hour and a half.
HAROLD
This is my protest.
Harold starts walking away.

Like McEnroe.
Matt hesitates.

MATT
OK, let me think...
A man, 30's, Gabe, is trying to get Matt's attention from a
table inside the restaurant. Matthew indicates for him to
follow them.
Matthew and Harold walk. There seems to be construction
everywhere they go. They pass wild-posting of ads for L.J.
Shapiro's retrospective at MOMA.
HAROLD
Not too far, because at three I
have to put money in the meter.
Gabe, sprinting, catches up to them.
HAROLD
This man is treading right on my
heels.
MATT
No, Dad, he's with me. This is
Gabe, he works at my firm in New
York.
Gabe joins them on the sidewalk.
GABE
Nice to meet you, Mr. Meyerowitz.
Gabe reaches out to shake Harold's hand, but Harold doesn't
take it.
MATT
I thought Gabe could join us for
part of lunch. His specialty is
in estate planning-HAROLD
I have an accountant.

57
MATT
Barry Sukenick doesn't work
on this scale, Dad.

GABE
I've had a chance to review
some of the documents--

MATT
And as we move toward selling the
house, I think it might be a good
time to get some affairs in order.
HAROLD
If we sell the house, it
will be my decision.

MATT
Well, Brian and James, who
you met--

HAROLD
They were a very charming,
interracial homosexual couple.
And smart about the work. They
were familiar with Gilded Halfwing.
MATT
Yes, James says they liked the
work very much and they love the
house. And they've made us an
offer.
HAROLD
For the work too?
GABE
For the work, the house, some of
the furniture...
INT. RESTAURANT #2
They enter the new restaurant.
MATT
(to the hostess)
Hi, three, please.
HOSTESS
If you’ll follow me-They follow her to the table.
HAROLD
(pointedly to Matt)
You know, your brother doesn't
want to sell.
Brother?
They all sit.

GABE

58
MATT
Half-brother. We have a different
mother.
(to Dad)
That's a real shame for him, then.
Danny stands the most to benefit.
He doesn't work.
HAROLD
He and Karen have separated.
MATT
(surprised)
Really?
HAROLD
I took him in, but now he's with
Jean in Rochester.
Shit.

MATT
HAROLD
Apparently his mother moved to
Florida, which I didn’t know. Did
you know that?
No.

MATT

HAROLD
She’s also still angry at me
apparently. You know, your
brother and sister have
helped organize a show for
me up at Bard.

MATT
A retrospective?
HAROLD
A retrospective of the faculty,
yes.
MATT
Like a group show?
HAROLD
There are other artists, yes, but
I've been promised a very
prominent place in the gallery.
MATT
(politely)
Sounds good. Congratulations.
Gabe gets out some papers from his briefcase.

59
GABE
You purchased the property in 1973
for 60 thousand dollars. But
since, you've borrowed against the
house a couple of times, the net
proceeds have diminished-HAROLD
Danny thinks after this show, my
work could appreciate considerably
in value and that we should wait.
MATT
(annoyed)
You just told me Danny doesn't
want to sell at all. Dad,
whatever happens at Bard, you
can't afford the real estate taxesGABE
You're paying two grand a month in
utilities. Even things you
wouldn't think, the housekeeper...
Gabe--

MATT

GABE
I'm just giving examples--

HAROLD
(sternly to Gabe)
Mercedes has been with us
for years. And although I
deplore her politics, I'm
not letting her go.
HAROLD
(re: Gabe)
Am I paying for him?

MATT
No, he's doing this as a favor to
me. Gabe's specialty is not my
specialty. I'm in personal
wealth.
HAROLD
Something I wouldn't know
about.

MATT
Gabe would only get paid
when we sell.

HAROLD
I'm not giving Gabe anything.
Absolutely not. And I’m not
having this conversation with him.
This is a private family matter.
OK.

GABE
I understand.

60
HAROLD
Normally a conspiracy is mounted
by people close to you. I don't
even know this asshole.
Harold stands up and walks toward the door.
MATT
(to the waiter)
We'll get a check.
GABE
We didn't order anything.
MATT
(sighs, to Gabe)
Sorry.
Matt rises.

He hands Gabe the poster roll and papers.

MATT
Can you take this to the office
for me?
To file?

GABE
MATT
No, it's some middle school term
papers and a Risky Business
poster.
INT. NEW FANCY RESTAURANT
Matt and Harold are stuffing bread into their mouths while
they consult their menus. They sit at a table for four at
the end of a crowded banquette.
HAROLD
I wanted to punch Gabe in the
nose.
MATT
The owner of this place is a
client, that's why we could get a
table so last minute.
Matt continues, looking to impress his Dad even just a
little.
MATT
That's why they gave us this
bigger table...

61
MATT (CONT'D)
I imagine they'll send us some
complimentary stuff too...
Harold struggles with a small aspirin container.
MATT
Is that Baby Aspirin?
HAROLD
Adult aspirin bothers my
stomach.

Are you OK?

HAROLD
I've had some headaches.

MATT

It's

Harold chews the two aspirin.
MATT
Have you gone to the doctor?
HAROLD
It's not necessary.
Matt lays two phones out in front of him.
one iPhone.

One Blackberry,

HAROLD
You're so important you need two
phones.
MATT
I saw L.J. has a show on at MOMA,
I thought I'd check it out.
HAROLD
(proudly)
I was at the opening.
Sigourney Weaver.
How is L.J.?

Uh huh.

I met

MATT

HAROLD
We chatted. She said to me,
"My name is Sigourney." I
said, "My name is Harold."

MATT

HAROLD
L.J. says he's going to try
to come to the show at Bard.

MATT
(politely)
That's great.

62
HAROLD
I'm sure L.J. would like to see
you there.
MATT
(vaguely)
If I'm in town...
HAROLD
I think I'm going to show the
bronze sphere. It's an early
piece I made when you used to sit
on the floor and watch me work.
You remember that?
MATT
You've told me this before, and I
don't remember it.
HAROLD
You would hand me tools and make
suggestions as if you too were the
artist.
MATT
Well, I wasn't.

HAROLD
It was originally untitled,
but I'm going to call it
"Matthew."

MATT
(changing the subject)
I'd like to see Eliza too. She
sent me her movie which I thought
was really good. Did you like it?
HAROLD
At that time I thought you might
be interested in sculpture. Or
maybe an actor or a comic. You
were a very talented mimic.
MATT
I do the voices of a lot of my coworkers which cracks people up at
the firm.
(doing a voice)
"I'm going to run downstairs for
an esmoke." You don't know Ezra,
but that's a pretty good
imitation.
HAROLD
You were also very musical like
Danny.

63
MATT
But Danny could really play.
HAROLD
He was chubby as a kid but
surprisingly dexterous. No, that's
true, Danny was quite gifted. I
don't know why he didn't pursue it.
I know he raised a child, but in
this day and age, it's possible to
do both.
MATT
There are so many other things
that factor in, don't you think?
HAROLD
I suppose that's true, he had a
difficult mother.
MATT
And poor Jean, I feel like she
just opted out of...life. Has
Jean ever had a boyfriend?
MATT
Or girlfriend?

HAROLD
Apparently her office-movies
show real ability.

HAROLD
I thought you'd do something
artistic.
MATT
I work with artists.
the temperament.

I understand

HAROLD
Maybe Eliza will be my heir in that
department. Although she seems
more commercially minded. And
potentially a lesbian.
MATT
Really? I didn't get that.
(clears his throat)
You know, I think I mentioned to
you, I left the company I was with
and me and a couple of other
people started our own firm.

64
HAROLD
Maureen is talking to a
friend who works at the
Times about getting someone
to come up and review the
show. In recent years, I've
been essentially ignored by
the Times and I think this
might put me back on the
map.

MATT
It was scary, and a big
change, but things have
settled and we're doing
really well. A lot of our
old clients came with us. I
think we're a great
alternative to some of the
bigger firms.

MATT
(showing Harold an image
on his phone)
This is our logo.
Harold unfolds his collapsible drugstore glasses and puts
them on.
HAROLD
Fifty-five dollars for a steak.
MATT
They're known for their meat here.
HAROLD
(reading the menu)
And thirty-five dollars for a
salmon. Do you get the salmon to
blow you for that price?

Do you want to split a salmon?

I'm going to get my own steak.

A whole portion is going to be too

Maybe a spinach for the table.
The potatoes sound good.
Sure.

MATT
HAROLD
Shall we get a wine?
MATT
Live it up.
HAROLD
And maybe this Brunello.
MATT
I'll have the steak. And the
market salad. And we don't have a
ton of time so if you can bring
everything at once...
The waiter leaves.
HAROLD
How's my grandson who I never get
to see?
Here.

MATT

He shows a photo on his phone to Harold.
HAROLD
He's quite handsome.

His hair is

MATT
No, that's his friend, Sebastian.
HAROLD
Oh, he's the one with his hand in
his trousers.
MATT
He was tucking in his shirt.

HAROLD
He looks like the child in
Kubrick's The Shining.

MATT
That's the sweater, I think.
HAROLD
Handsome boy. Has the Meyerowitz
eyes. Does he like the Knicks? I
suppose he'll be a Laker fan since
you're essentially an Angeleno at
this point.
MATT
Yeah, but New York isn’t
what it was. My artist
clients are all moving out
west now.

HAROLD
I've never forgiven Kobe for
what he did.

MATT
It's hard to have a relationship
AND a child.
MATT
I imagine you've felt that too.
HAROLD
No, not really. I didn't find
that difficult.
MATT
Dad, you've been married FOUR
times.
Three.

HAROLD
The first was annulled.

I married her because of Tony,

it would mean to leave, but...even

I go to an

Well, I haven't met his mother so I
can't advise you in that
department.
MATT
You could have met her if you'd
come to our wedding.
HAROLD
You did it in LA.
MATT
There are planes.

HAROLD
I always felt you should
have invited your brother
and sister.

MATT
They're half. I don't talk to
them or know them really...
HAROLD
You and your brother were quite
close as kids. I remember you
dressing like him.
MATT
He lived with us for one year
until you kicked him out.
HAROLD
I didn't kick him out. He needed
to go back with his mom and Jean.
Your mom felt we didn't have
enough space.

68
MATT
Well, anyway, I didn't invite a
lot of people, but everyone I
invited, including Mom, came
except for you.
HAROLD
Well, if you break up what does it
matter anyway?
A fashionable European man and woman are eating at a
smaller table next to Harold and Matt, in the same
banquette. The European man, while in conversation, puts
his glasses case on the Meyerowitz table.
HAROLD
It's so brazen.
What?

MATT
HAROLD
This jerk placed his glasses on
our table.
MATT
I don't think he realizes.
HAROLD
No, he knows exactly what he's
doing.
MATT
Dad, in terms of your estate, I
don't want you to make mistakes
that can be avoided.
HAROLD
Then they will be my mistakes.
They're served their wine.
HAROLD
Before she dried out, Maureen
drank half my wine cellar so I
haven't had any good wine in a
while. But she's been sober now
for six weeks.
MATT
Is she still going to AA?

69
HAROLD
She’s doing it her own way.
Maureen is made uncomfortable by AA
which I can understand. It's quite
infantilizing giving away your
control like that.
MATT
I think that's the idea.
HAROLD
I tell Maureen, I don't like you
when you drink. You become a
different person, I say.
(exasperated)
Do we look like we need two
ketchups?
MATT
What are you talking about?
HAROLD
This son of a bitch just put his
ketchup on our table too.
The ketchup bottle is now next to the glasses case at the
end of their table.
HAROLD
Before you know it, he'll be
sitting in my lap.
The man balls up his napkin and puts it next to the ketchup
and glasses case on their table.
HAROLD
I want to punch this guy in the
nose.
MATT
It's fine Dad, we have the bigger
table. Just let it go.
The man now places his wine glass on their table. Harold
reaches over and takes a sip from the glass and puts it
back. Matt looks horrified.
MATT
Dad, what the fuck-The Man doesn't notice, however. He and his date are
finishing up and preparing to leave.

70
MATT
Please don't do that again.
HAROLD
It's my protest.
MATT
You better hope he doesn't have a
cold.
The European man grabs his jacket from the shared banquette
bench as Harold and leaves with his date.
MATT
They're gone. Can you relax now?
I'd like to relax now?
So brazen.

HAROLD

MATT
(changing the subject)
I think the Knicks might be
interesting this year--

HAROLD
Wait a minute. Where's my jacket?
MATT
Right next to you.
HAROLD
This isn't my jacket.
(he looks around)
That son of a bitch took my
jacket.
MATT
What do you mean?

HAROLD
He has my jacket, Matthew.

Outside the window, the European man and his date are
talking. Their steaks are brought to the table.
MATT
He's still outside-back.

I'll get it

HAROLD
Shit, it's three o'clock. I have
to put money in the meter.
Forget it.

MATT
HAROLD
(sternly)
I'm not getting a ticket, Matthew.

71
MATT
Fuck it, I'm going to grab the
guy, you get the check and settle
up?
HAROLD
I thought you were paying. I
wouldn't have ordered that wine
otherwise.
MATT
Well, what do you want me to do?
HAROLD
Where's our waiter?
(loudly to the waiter)
Excuse me! Excuse me!
People look over at them.
Dad--

MATT

HAROLD
Can we get a bill?!

Matt is given the check and he instantly hands over his
credit card.
HAROLD
(standing)
You're not going to look at the
bill? Make sure that it all adds
up.
MATT
We don't have time Dad, he's
getting away.
HAROLD
We never got the spinach. Or any
of the free stuff you suggested
they might give us-EXT. STREET NEAR FANCY RESTAURANT

the distance)
It's on its way.
CUT TO: Harold is moving as quickly as possible. He stops
to catch his breath. He watches his son up ahead talking
heatedly with the European couple.
He puts his hand into the jacket pocket and retrieves a
small piece of white paper. He stares at it.
CUT TO: The European man removes his right glove with his
teeth and feels the material of his jacket with his bare
hand.

This is my jacket, man.

I think it isn't.

Listen, just wait a second, OK?
Jesus, what does it cost you?
Where you got to be?

So crazy, man.
The couple walks briskly ahead.

Where's he going?
Matt, turning it on now, catches up to the man and touches
his shoulder.
Hey!

Turn around!

The European Man turns around violently, his fist clenched.
EUROPEAN MAN
You want to get hit, man.
MATT
What's your problem? Can't you
see, you took my father's jacket.
He has yours. What's the fucking
problem?!
Matt looks back at his father who is staring at the small
piece of paper.

Dad give him his jacket.
What's that?

And Matthew, you were making up
all of those card games, do you
remember? And there was one in
particular where I asked if it was
based on luck and you said it was
based on “hope.”
Harold gives Matthew a warm squeeze on the neck.

You “hope” you get a good card.

very jealous, I had already sold a
piece to the Whitney.
MATT
Where do they keep that piece?

It's not lost. They catalog these
things.

I didn't say it was.

I thought Cody was a gym teacher.
JULIA
He taught Spanish at PS 182 and
coached the soccer team. Matthew,
Cody's sons are coming for dinner.
I'm making a meatloaf.
OK, good.

MATT
I'm starving.

HAROLD
I told Matthew, this seems
like an elaborate ruse just
to get his parents back
together.

Julia laughs.
MATT
You didn't tell me that.
Matt's phone is ringing.

He checks it.

MATT
This is Tony on Face Time, do you
mind if I-JULIA
Harold, do you want a coffee or
tea or anything?
MATT
He has to go--

HAROLD
Tea would be nice. I can't
have coffee after four. And
if you have a Triscuit or
something. I'm also
starving.

Matt steps away, somewhat hesitantly, as he doesn't like
the idea of leaving his Dad alone with his Mom. He answers
the phone holding it out to see his son on the other end.
MATT
Hi, sweetheart.
TONY
I'm playing a game for a minute,
it's called All The Animals Are
Dead.
MATT
Can you move the phone up so I can
see-- The other way...
That's down.

TONY

MATT
Down then, honey.

Matt watches his father and mother talking.
Harold tea.
JULIA
Sorry, I'm in the middle of
cooking for a big clan tonight.
HAROLD
Is this my Buddenbrooks?
What?

JULIA
Harold removes a book from the shelf
HAROLD
I think this is my copy of
Buddenbrooks.

Harold looks back at the shelf for other books that may
have been his. Matt, distracted by his parents, frowns.
TONY
Would you rather a beard made from
paper or a beard made from a tree?
MATT
What's a beard from a tree?
TONY
A beard made from a tree is like
beard that is like a tree.
MATT
(to Tony)
Like the leaves on a tree?

Yeah.

TONY
But like a beard.

MATT
I guess a beard made from a tree?
TONY
Me too.
(new one)
Would you rather die from old age
or kill yourself?
Matt watches his Dad sloppily blow his nose into a
handkerchief.
MATT
(almost to himself)
Old age, I guess.
Me too.

TONY
VICTORIA
Did you give him regular milk?
MATT
(startles)
Victoria, I didn't know you were
there.
VICTORIA
Of course I'm here, he doesn't
know how to use the phone himself.
Yes, I do!

TONY

VICTORIA
He has red all over his
cheeks and chin, he said

He likes it better--

He can't have dairy.

JULIA (O.S.)
We were very thorough when we
divided the books. That I
remember.
MATT
(approaching his father)
Me too. Put it back, Dad.
He kind of half places it back.
HAROLD
I've been looking for this
edition.
MATT
You've lived without it now for
thirty years, I think you'll
manage.
JULIA
(walking back into the
living room)
You can take it, Harold, if you
want. I've mostly stopped reading
fiction.
MATT
Dad, I'll walk you to your car.
HAROLD
I can stay a bit longer.
Julia embraces Harold.

JULIA
It was so nice to see you again. I
think the last time was Matt’s
graduation. You know, I've always
wanted to say, and I've thought
about writing or calling, but I
just never did it... I have huge
regrets about how I was with Danny
and Jean. I was a kid too, in many
ways, and they were so angry at me.
I took your lead, frankly, and we
were starting over -- we had
Matthew! -- and we didn't want to
look back, which was
understandable, but...I wish I'd
been more nurturing of them, more
generous, more mothering, really.
I think they've suffered in part
because of that and I feel
terrible. Anyway, I just wanted to
say that.
EXT. MATT’S MOM’S APARTMENT. COBBLE HILL. NIGHT
Matt walks briskly, a step or two ahead of his father.
HAROLD
It's called flirting when you're
young, I'm not sure what it's
called when you're over seventy.
MATT
(pointing up ahead)
You're just up here--

HAROLD
She still has my drawing on
her wall next to the gym
teacher's doodle.

MATT
Cody's a good guy.
HAROLD
Your mother's more comfortable
ultimately being with men who are
half-smart, men she can dominate.
I was much too formidable. After
our separation, and before Cody,
she was with a homosexual and
before that a man who had no foot.
They stop at the car.
HAROLD
Her fraudulent claims about not
reading fiction I find offensive.
(MORE)

81
HAROLD (CONT'D)
She's masquerading as a populist so
as not to threaten Cody, but it's a
clever yet bogus subterfuge. It's
a shame your mother, who knows
better, has succumbed to this
fashionable anti-art movement.
This is why we have a Republican
congress.
Matt sees that Harold carries the copy of Buddenbrooks.

It was

MATT
(annoyed)
You have your keys?
HAROLD
She was clearly very happy to see
me. When it ended we weren't on
speaking terms, but now you see
that big hug she insisted on
giving me.
(pause)
You know, Maureen always says your
mother was the love of my life.
MATT
You taking the bridge or the
tunnel?

HAROLD
I thought you were leaving
tomorrow? That's why I
drove all the way into
Brooklyn.

MATT
I'm staying a few days.
(coughs)
I was around all this plaster dust
earlier...
HAROLD
We have lots of room. Maureen is
keen on seeing you as well. You
know, she's your step-mother as
much as Cody is your step-father.
MATT
I told Mom I'd stay here.
HAROLD
Maybe you split half the time
there and half with us?

82
MATT
(snapping)
I'm not splitting the time like I
did at fifteen.
HAROLD
It was very important to me, after
our separation, that I see you
half the time. I wanted to make
it up after Danny and Jean.
MATT
(with growing anger)
Then make it up to them.

HAROLD
I made a real effort with
you. Danny and Jean, I
could have done better, but
I don't see anything
significant I could have
done better with you.

MATT
Really? Nothing? You feel
like that all was great?

HAROLD
Come on, Matthew.

MATT
Danny definitely got shit, and
Jean didn’t EVEN get shit. But I
got your focus and that fucked me
up in a whole other way.
HAROLD
Matthew, we never see each other,
let's not fight.
MATT
(furiously)
I keep thinking I know how to
handle you now, but then I see you
and I get suckered into your shit
all over again. Your career, your
jacket! And when I try to actually
help you like today, you WON'T
LISTEN.
Harold opens the car door and hesitates.
HAROLD
I don't know how I could be such a
bad father, look how successful
you are.
Right--

MATT

HAROLD
I could never be the
businessman you are.

83

OK--

MATT

HAROLD
I've said to Maureen, I
don't know who Matthew takes
after. I certainly didn't
know how to make money.

Matt shouts across the vehicle.
MATT
That’s right, I don’t take after
you. None of us do. You had to
be the only artist in the family.
And it doesn’t matter that I make
money because you don't respect
what I do!
Harold climbs in the car.
HAROLD
What do you need my respect for,
the world respects you because you
make money.
MATT
(throws up his hands)
Ugh, I want to punch YOU in the
nose!
Matt runs around to the driver's side.
HAROLD
I know you think you can treat me
this way because of your money.
MATT
It doesn't matter how much money I
make, you make me feel like a big
piece of shit because YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT IT!
Harold starts the car.
MATT
But you also actually DO! You're
privately obsessed with it. You
know that I BEAT you! I BEAT YOU!
The car pulls away.
MATT
What the fuck am I talking about?
I'm so angry at myself for getting
sucked into THIS!

The Opening
TEXT:
In her twelve years as a neurosurgeon Dr. Malini Soni had never
seen such a dramatic shove.

INT. NURSE’S STATION, PITTSFIELD HOSPITAL. DAY
The sucking and periodic beeping sounds of a hospital.
DR. SONI (V.O.)
It's quite startling.
CUT TO: CLOSE on a CAT SCAN
DR. SONI (O.S.)
A collection of fluids on the left
side of the head was shoving the
brain clear to the right.
A finger enters the frame, pointing.
DR. SONI (O.S.)
His brain experienced so much
pressure and irritation, that he
was in an almost comatose state
before we operated.
Dr. Soni, an Indian woman in her 40's, and Pam, 30's, a
nurse hover above a computer screen at a terminal.
DR. SONI
There was still some bleeding in
the left frontal lobe, but no
tissue was lost. The head trauma
clogged up the spinal fluid
absorption pathways which slows
speech, causes lethargy,
headaches.
Dr. Soni straightens up and heads for the door.
follows her into the --

Pam

85
DR. SONI
(shakes her head)
Honestly, this should have been
taken care of immediately after
the trauma.
PAM
Did you notice, his wife was
heavily perfumed, but I think I
smelled alcohol on her breath.
DR. SONI
Yes, I'm worried about her as
well.
They both stop at a hospital room doorway.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
Danny and Jean sit in adjacent chairs. Danny, slumped, in
his soft leather jacket and shorts stares into space. He
has a brown grocery bag of clothes in his lap. Jean reads
a book. They both look exhausted.
Harold lies unconscious in bed, an oxygen mask on his face
and a drain protruding from a shaved portion of his head.
PAM
Oh, I didn’t realize anyone was
here.
The siblings startle and both stand immediately. Danny's
bag slipping from his lap and hitting the floor, the
clothes spilling out.
Shit!

DANNY
Sorry.

He starts collecting his underwear and socks.
Sleeping.

JEAN

DANNY
Not doing much...sleeping.

Pam checks his blood pressure and oxygen readings.
Good.

PAM
You're family?

DANNY
Yes, we got here once we
heard --

JEAN
Maureen only told us he was
in the hospital this
morning.

86
They look at one another, surprised they're both talking at
once.
DANNY
Via text. We drove from
Rochester.
JEAN
We wanted to talk to a
doctor.
I'm Pam.
Jean.

DANNY
We haven't been able to get
any information.

PAM
This is Dr. Soni.

JEAN
Danny.

DANNY

JEAN
Dr. Soni, can you tell us what's
going on with our Dad?
DR. SONI
When your mother is here we can go
over everything.
DANNY
She's our step-mother.

JEAN
We both have another mother.

JEAN
She would have been seven when she
had me.
DR. SONI
Well, when your step-mother comes
back-JEAN
We can't find her.

DANNY
Her voice-mail is full.

JEAN
Why can't you tell us right now?
DR. SONI
This is awkward.
What?

DANNY
DR. SONI
Um...I don't want to get involved
in family dynamics, but she told
me not to talk to anyone else.

87
DANNY
Well, that's not right, obviously.
We're his kids.
JEAN
You can talk to us.
DR. SONI
No, that's what I'm saying: since
she's the next of kin, I legally
cannot talk to you. I'm very
sorry.
They both stare back at her, desperate.
DANNY
He has an opening on Monday.
JEAN
(oddly)
This is our first real hospital.
DR. SONI
Talk to your step-mother...
EXT. PITTSFIELD BAR. DAY
Maureen furtively exits the local bar, wearing her rose
tinted glasses, and heads briskly down the main street.
DANNY (O.S.)
Why did you tell the doctor not to
talk to us?
She spots Danny and Jean out of the corner of her eye and
picks up the pace.
Maureen!

JEAN
Danny and Jean run to catch up.
before.

Danny, limping worse than

MAUREEN
(re: his limp)
Are you moving that way on
purpose?
DANNY
What? No? It's always worse
after I've been sitting.
MAUREEN
I thought you were mocking me.

88
DANNY
You don't walk that way.
MAUREEN
I thought it was a bad imitation.
Maureen!

DANNY

JEAN
We need to be able to talk
to Doctor Soni.

MAUREEN
Doctor Soni looks very much like a
chum of mine from university who
became an art looter, but that's
of no use to you.
No.

DANNY

JEAN
Absolutely none.

MAUREEN
I'll get the information and you
can ask me. E-mail might be best
if you're going to be in
Rochester.
I'm here.
I'm here.

JEAN
Danny's here.
DANNY

JEAN
You have to tell her it's OK to
speak to me or Danny or Matt,
who’s on his way.
DANNY
Matt’s coming?

JEAN
He texted me. I texted him.

DANNY
He texted you? You texted him?
They reach Maureen's car.
MAUREEN
Do you think I'm not going to tell
you the truth?
She opens the driver's seat door.
JEAN
I can drive, Maureen.

89
MAUREEN
(getting into the car)
Jean, you were wearing that same
sweater that last time I saw you.
JEAN
(baffled)
Was I?
Maureen starts the car, the siblings stand outside.
DANNY
(emotional)
Maureen, we've been sitting in
that room with him and he's
attached to those machines and
there's a drain in his head and
he's unconscious and we don't know
where you are or what's going on?
(snapping)
TALK TO THE DOC-EXT. PITTSFIELD HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. SUNRISE
In the dawn light, a rental car pulls up. Matt climbs out
of the back holding a leather overnight bag. He wears his
suit, rumpled from the flight, with a T-shirt.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
Matt sits across from his father who sleeps.
Oh, hi.

Pam comes in.

PAM
Matt smiles tiredly.
Hey.

MATT

PAM
He's still sleeping?
Pam, the nurse.

MATT
I'm Matt, the son.
PAM
Oh, I met your brother and sister.
MATT
Half brother and sister, yeah.

Is

I'm

90
PAM
Dr. Soni spoke with your stepmother and then with your siblings
-- half-siblings -- and it's all
been cleared up and she can talk
to you freely now.
Oh...OK.

MATT
How's he doing?

PAM
Your father was brought to us the
night before last, but because he
was taking baby aspirin, which
thins the blood, Dr. Soni had to
wait until the morning to operate.
MATT
What happened?
PAM
He had a chronic subdural
hematoma, which in his case meant
there had been steady bleeding in
his head for some time.
MATT
How did he get this?
PAM
Something like this generally
comes from a fall or if he hit his
head-MATT
He fell about four months ago.
Bruno pulled him onto a path.
PAM
Honestly, I'm surprised he had
such a delayed response. He must
have a real tolerance for
discomfort.
MATT
Will he be OK?
PAM
Well, because he waited so long,
there was quite a bit of
irritation in the frontal lobes
and now that the pressure is off
the brain, it causes severe
agitation.
(MORE)

91
PAM (CONT'D)
The frontal lobes are language.
(pause)
But it’s potentially a hundred
percent recoverable.
Harold opens his eyes and looks up at Matt.

I'll leave you guys.
MATT
Thanks, Pam.
Harold smiles brightly, almost innocently.

Of course, it's Matthew.
Matt, encouraged, holds up his phone.
MATT
What is this?
HAROLD

Yes.

MATT
(smiles)
HAROLD
This is...
MATT
What, Dad?
This...

HAROLD
You...

MATT
It's OK, we don't have to talk.
HAROLD
I can say it.
(slowly but clearly)
You're here. Is...what I wanted.
Matt hesitates.

Matt smiles

92
MATT
How...how are you feeling?
HAROLD
I'm happy...you're here.
MATT
I took a red-eye when I

Yeah...
heard.

HAROLD
That makes me happy.
MATT
(wiping his face)
Thank you, Dad. I'm sorry...we...
I'm sorry this happened.
Harold takes Matt's hand.
HAROLD
When is my...?
(he makes a face having
difficulty with the
word)
MATT
Your opening? It's on Monday.
HAROLD
Is that today?
MATT
No, today is Wednesday.
HAROLD
Will...it happen?
MATT
It will happen, Dad. I don't know
if you'll be able to go.
Will you?
Sure.

HAROLD
MATT
I'll go.

HAROLD
You speak for me.
MATT
I can say something, yes.

HAROLD
It's yours...
Harold smiles and closes his eyes. The first light from
outside now arriving through the window.
HAROLD
We made it together.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY
Matt approaches Pam.
MATT
I have a meeting in the City which
I really need to go to.

I think so. Yes.
MATT
You have my number.

Call me if

TONY (V.O.)
Where you are?
EXT. GAS STATION
Matt pumps gas and talks to Tony on Face Time. It's a
chilly morning and he didn't put a coat on when he got out
of the car.

94
MATT
I'm in Pittsfield.
Massachusetts.

It's in

TONY'S VOICE
Is that like New York?
MATT
Well, it's a different state.

MATT
It looks like rain.

You can't fight the weather.

Yeah.

MATT
TONY’S VOICE
And ninjas. You know who is good
at playing ninjas? Jim.
MATT
Who's Jim?
TONY’S VOICE
He's a handyman.
MATT
I've never heard of Jim.
TONY’S VOICE
You used to live here but you
don't anymore. If you did, you'd
know Jim.
MATT
Do you see a lot of Jim?
TONY’S VOICE
He comes on weekends. Is this a
weekend?
MATT
In three days it's a weekend.
TONY’S VOICE
Three days! That's three weeks.

95
MATT
No, sweetheart, it's three days.
Does...does Jim stay over?
TONY’S VOICE
No, Jim doesn't sleep. He stays
up all night with Mommy eating
dinner and leaves in the morning.
MATT
(addled)
Hold on...I'm getting another
call.
TONY'S VOICE
Raise your hand if ninjas are your
favorite thing.
Matt raises his hand.
MATT
Just a second, sweetheart.
TONY’S VOICE
I’m pressing the button.

No, wait... Just hold on.
Matt clicks over.

The elevator doors open. Matt comes running out.

INT. HAROLD'S HOSPITAL ROOM
Matt enters.

Danny and Jean are talking over each other.

JEAN
Danny, stop, it doesn't

DANNY
Maybe if he hears it--

JEAN
(to Harold)
Do you know who this is?

96
HAROLD
(with difficulty)
It's all right.
DANNY
Do you remember when you said:
"Danny."
JEAN
You have to stop giving him the
answers.
Matt looks between his siblings and his Dad with confusion.
DANNY
(pointing at Matt)
Who is this?
We SWING over to find Matt.
HAROLD
(vaguely)
It's all right.
Oh...no.
It’s Matt.

MATT
DANNY
He just got

JEAN
Stop giving him the answers.

A bald male nurse, 40's, enters. The nurse looks at Harold
and says as if speaking to a child.
MALE NURSE
How are we doing?
HAROLD
(weakly)
It's all right.
MATT
Where's Pam?
MALE NURSE
Pam Engels or Pam Chin?
MATT
I don't know? I was JUST here and
he knew what a Blackberry was and
could say my name and everything.
(to Danny and Jean)
We talked about his show.

97
DANNY
(surprised)
You were here?
(and then)
Where were you?
MALE NURSE
Sometimes it can take a little
while to come back from these
surgeries.
MATT
(upset)
No, he was already BACK!
MALE NURSE
(confused)
I'm sorry, who are you?
everybody?
(laughs)
I just got here.
DANNY
We're his kids.

Who is

Where's Pam?

MATT

MALE NURSE
I wasn't here, so I don't know.
MATT
I WAS! That's what I'm telling
you. Where's Pam?
DANNY
(hurt)
Why didn't you call?
you go?
MATT
I was heading back to the
City for a meeting, but I
turned around when Pam
called--

Where did
MALE NURSE
Sometimes tiredness can
cause this. And his blood
pressure is quite high.

MATT
This isn't tiredness! Something
is WRONG. Can't we find Pam?!
MALE NURSE
(offended)
No, I'm the charge nurse.

DANNY
(to Matt)
You were here. Why didn't
you call us?

98
MATT
(sharply to Danny)
Because it never occurred to me!
OK?
JEAN
Where's Dr. Soni?
MALE NURSE
She's on her rounds.
MATT
Something is happening to my
father! I want Pam!
MALE NURSE
(sharply)
Ok, you're going to have to stop
shouting.
DANNY
We’re sorry, he’s just emotional.
JEAN
It's our Dad.

MATT
I’m not emotional, Danny, I
want Pam.

MALE NURSE
Right now, we're waiting for a
neurologist to read his EEG for
brainwave activity.
MATT
When will that happen?
MALE NURSE
I don't know. It's being read in
India.
DANNY
Oh, because of...

Why?

MALE NURSE

In the meantime, I'm going to give
him Lotensin for his high blood
pressure. I'll be right back.
He leaves.

Matt turns to Danny and Jean.

He's giving him Lotensin. What did
he get before for his blood
pressure?

Umm...the other nurse came
through. She did something.

Yeah, she seemed to know-MATT
Did you write it down?

I can't remember...

Me neither.

From now on everything gets
written down. Do you understand?
DANNY

It's one thing. You can read what
number it is now. He's alive.
Jesus. These people do this for a
living.

These people change every five
minutes. If we're not paying
attention he might DIE. Do you
understand THAT?
Danny looks like he’s about to cry like a scolded child.
I do.

INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM
Dr. Soni addresses the three siblings who listen
attentively, scribbling in pads in their laps.
DR. SONI
An up and down is common but this
is more of a down than expected.
If it was his heart, we'd shock him
out of it, but you can't shock the
brain in these cases so we need to
quiet the brain.
The three siblings turn the pages in their books almost in
unison but not quite.
DR. SONI
We're putting him in a barbiturate
coma with a combination of Propofol
and Pentobarbital or Phenobarbital.
Probably Pento. I want to be
aggressive.
JEAN
Will he be OK?
DR. SONI
Think of it like shutting down a
computer and then restarting. Or
if you're a luddite like me, like
a grain of sand becoming a pearl.

chasing her.
JEAN
Do you have to go?
you just push it?

Can't

DANNY
We need you here.

DR. SONI
(laughs)
God, no, my husband will divorce
me! We’re going to China.
MATT
You're putting our Dad in a coma
and then leaving us?
DANNY
Matt, it's not like that.
(then not sure)
(MORE)

102
DANNY (CONT'D)
It's not, right Dr. Soni?
not like that.

It's

DR. SONI
Well, technically, yes, it's that.
DANNY
You can't do that to us.

MATT
First Pam, now you?

DANNY
Can we get Pam back at least?
DR. SONI
I'm not in charge of the nurse
assignments.
(aside to a passing man)
Hi, Doctor Liu.
DANNY
It doesn't feel fair, Dr. Soni,
that you can just live your live
normally while our Dad is lying
here.
DR. SONI
(hesitates)
Maybe it isn't.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY
Matt and Danny end up next to each another, walking down
the hall. Danny hums an indecipherable tune.
DANNY
Dad said you started your own
company?
MATT
Yeah, a couple of other guys
and me decided to--

DANNY
(trying to engage)
So, how does that work? Do
you just tell your boss,
like--?

MATT
Well, I was one of the partners so
I didn't technically have a boss-DANNY
Right, no...so you got a better
offer--

103
MATT
No, there was no offer, that's
what was so scary, we were
creating our own opportunity-DANNY
Because you wanted something smallerMATT
Bigger. Many of the firm's clients
came with us-DANNY
Which was surprising-They reach an elevator.

Matt hits the button.

MATT
No, we expected it. We can't
legally ask the clients to come
with us, but we trusted-DANNY
But they don't have much choice-MATT
It's totally their choice-DANNY
No, I know, because you have their
money-MATT
Well, their money is with the
firm. But their money is in
investments or a bank-The elevator arrives.

They get on.

INT. ELEVATOR
DANNY
I understand. My buddy, Ptolemy,
he lives across the street, or
lived across the street from where
I lived-MATT
Dad told me about your...Karen,
I'm sorry. I've also--

104
DANNY
Ptolemy is like you, he works in
a...
(fishing for it)
Arbitrage.
MATT
Yeah, that's not what I do.
DANNY
No, I wasn't saying-- But Ptolemy
said the system is rigged from the
inside-MATT
That's not entirely true--

DANNY
But mostly--

MATT
So, this is an exciting time for
me.
DANNY
How's your boy?
MATT
Good, Victoria and I are having
some problems.
DANNY
I never met her.

Karen and I

MATT
I know, I just said I was sorry.
DANNY
Did you?
(pause)
I'm sorry too.
MATT
(moving on)
I liked Eliza's movie!
DANNY
(surprised)
She sent it to you?
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY
They get off the elevator and head through the lobby toward
the parking lot.

105
MATT
(to Danny)
Are you limping?
Jean rises from a bench where she's been waiting for them.
Yes!

JEAN
DANNY
It's always stiff after I've been
sitting.
MATT
You should see the other dog.
What?
Nothing.

I borrowed an old cane of Maureen’s

I/E. MAUREEN'S HOUSE. BACK PORCH
Matthew, Danny and Jean are playing cards.
DANNY
(suddenly)
Would you fuck Pam?
Matt’s considers this.
I would.

JEAN
Just kidding.

MATT
Jean, are you seeing anyone?
Danny looks at Matt, surprised.
No.

JEAN
INT. MAUREEN’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. LATER NIGHT
Matt adds up figures on a calculator with lightening speed.
Danny, eats a huge sandwich. Jean flips through a photo
album.
JEAN
You were both such middle-aged men
in the making.
INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP. DAY
The siblings stare at the various nick-knacks.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
Nighttime in the hospital room. Harold is comatose,
intubated and hooked up to machines doing everything for
him. He still has a drain in his head and feeding tube in
his stomach.
Danny is lying between two chairs, asleep. He dips slowly
between the divide in chairs. A hand gently rustles his
shoulder. He looks up. It's Jean. He nods, rises,
gathers his things.
DANNY
(sleepily, but attentive)
The night nurse today is named
Rich. He's OK, but doesn't really
know anything. Dad's blood
pressure was 178 so they gave him
Lopressor. It's down to 154 now.

107
DANNY (CONT'D)
I wrote it down. Keep an eye on
it.
He hands her the notebook.
I will.

JEAN
Jean takes Danny's seat, props up her feet and takes out a
book.
CUT TO: A nurse opens a curtain. Sunlight through the
window. Jean is woken by Matt who relieves her.
JEAN
His blood pressure dropped so they
put him on a Levophed drip, but
that’s hard on his kidneys, so
make sure they keep him hydrated
with the IV...
Matt nods and takes her place at their Dad's side.
CUT TO: Matt works on a stack of tax documents with his
calculator. He hears laughter. He gazes into the hallway.
Two nurses are looking at a menu.

They chat casually.

NURSE #1
It should taste really sweet
too...it was a little gooey.
Eww.

NURSE #2
It freaked me out.

NURSE #1
Do I want meatballs?

Matt watches.
A machine starts beeping.

Matt looks up suddenly.

DOCTOR GONZALEZ (V.O.)
--and overnight he contracted
sepsis, which is a full body
inflammation.
INT. ICU ROOM/HALLWAY
Danny, Matt, and Jean are confronted by a new doctor, Dr.
Gonzalez.
Oh, shit.

MATT

DOCTOR GONZALEZ
Unfortunately the longer
he’s here the more
susceptible he is to
infection.

108
JEAN
What about his brain?
an EEG?

Do we have

DOCTOR GONZALEZ
This is a different unit, we're in
the ICU, so I don't have those
answers as of yet.
MATT
So, now we're in the right unit to
treat his sepsis, but the wrong
unit to treat his head?
DOCTOR GONZALEZ
(nods)
They have a call in to a
neurologist. People rarely come
in on weekends.
MATT
Do people not generally get sick
on weekends?
DOCTOR GONZALEZ
We're working on getting you those
answers.
The doctor hands Matthew a pamphlet.
shows it to Danny.

He looks at it and

DOCTOR GONZALEZ
This is a helpful summary of the
conversations you might want to
have, things you might want to
think about.
DANNY
(reading)
An end of life conversation?
DOCTOR GONZALEZ
It helps you prepare. In case.
EXT. TRAIN STATION
Eliza meets the three siblings outside on the platform.
INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE
The siblings, Eliza and Maureen sit for an end of life
conversation, taking notes. A group of doctors talk to
them from across a large table.

109
DOCTOR
These are things we suggest you
say to your father before it's too
late: "I love you." "I forgive
you." "Forgive me." "Thank you."
"Goodbye."
INT. ICU HOSPITAL ROOM
Eliza unpacks a blue-tooth speaker and a phone from her
backpack and sets it up to play music for her grandfather.
Danny places Harold's catalogue under the speaker as a
base.
She plays a loud Nick Cave song.
ELIZA
He told me he liked this when I
played it once.
Eliza sobs at her grandfather's bedside. Danny, Matt and
Jean regard this. They've been so caught in the hospital
struggle they haven't had much time to be emotional.
TONY (O.S.)
I want to say bye now.
INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA
Eliza and Matthew are at a table looking at Matthew's
phone.
MATT
We just got on the phone!
TONY (O.S.)
I’m going to press the button.

Hi Tony, you remember me?

This is Eliza, your cousin?
Wait...

TONY (O.S.)
I’m pressing the butt--

MATT
Shit!

Eliza laughs. Danny limps over with an unripe banana and a
yogurt on his tray.

110
DANNY
(sitting)
I'm oddly growing fond of this
cafeteria, like I’d almost come
here just anyway to eat. How’s
your boy?
MATT
She fucking gets in his head.
He’s always hanging up on me now.
DANNY
Call him back.
MATT
I don’t want to call him back, it
makes me feel bad.
DANNY
He’s five years old. They hate
phones. Eliza, when you were that
age you’d never talk on the phone.
MATT
She makes it too difficult. I
don’t know, sometimes I think
maybe I sit this kid out and start
another family and then he finds
me when he’s twenty-one. Let him
come to me.
Danny gets up to grab napkins from another table.
DANNY
He’s not a girl you’re trying to
trick into dating you.
ELIZA
Dad, your limp is worse.
DANNY
It's always stiff after I've been
sitting.
ELIZA
I was looking on-line, it could be
your hip.
DANNY
It's my back.

MATT
We should get you checked
out.

111
DANNY
I don't have time to see a doctor
now.
MATT
We're already AT a doctor.
Eliza laughs.

Danny sits back down.

DANNY
I know what it is, OK?
MATT
What is it?
DANNY
It's...I...I mean I
basically KNOW.

ELIZA
Dad, you got to deal with
it.

MATT
Yeah, Dan, I mean, look at Dad.
He ignored his thing and-DANNY
Just let me eat my fucking banana,
OK?!
Matt and Eliza share a quick smile.
DANNY
And call your son!
Matt hesitates and slowly gets up to make the call.
EXT. MAUREEN'S DRIVEWAY. LATE DAY
Maureen pulls into the gravel nodding hello to Matt who
stretches before a run.
MATT
Hi, Maureen.
She drives past Matt. Matt continues to loosen up as we
watch her car slowly veer onto the grass and roll down into
a tree. Matt turns when he hears the soft impact.
INT. MAUREEN’S HOUSE. KITCHEN
It's filled with dusty appliances, yogurt containers full of
tacks and coins, faded photos and outdated menus crookedly
affixed with random refrigerator magnets. Matt finds a musty
water pitcher with an old filter and fills it.

112
MAUREEN
It's a shame the Dad is going to
miss the opening tomorrow. He was
really looking forward to it.
MATT
Dad asked me to say something. I
was going to ask Danny and Jean
too.
He removes some mismatched bowls from a cabinet, looking
for glasses. A Popov vodka bottle is stashed in the back.
He turns around. Maureen quickly averts her eyes. Matt
hesitates and takes the bottle.
MAUREEN
He never would have expected you
to have shown up. We were trying
to figure it out, have you ever
even been to this house before?
No...

MATT
He pours her and him a glass of vodka. She hesitates, but
takes it. She holds a frozen pack of peas to the bruise on
her face.
MAUREEN
The Dad always hoped for a visit
but I guess you always had a lot to
do in the City when you came to
town. And us not being A-list
parents and all. Danny and Jean,
of course, are here all the time,
but that’s less exciting for the
Dad.
Matt drinks his vodka.
MATT
I reached out to some of his old
friends who are going to come
visit.
MAUREEN
(rising)
I hope they understand they'll be
looking at a sleeping man. Hello
Andy Warhol!
MATT
I explained that.
words.

In so many

113
MAUREEN
I spoke to the neurologist, Dr.
Diebert, who seems very
knowledgeable, but has no upper lip
to speak of, and if Harold survives
the infection, they have no idea
what person will be there when he
wakes up. Maybe he'll be Brad
Pitt. Or Neruda. Or Joe the
Plumber.
(with real feeling, but
dramatically)
I just want him to be Harold.
MATT
(changing the subject)
Have you looked over the documents
I sent you?
Maureen rises and retrieves an envelope from a drawer.
MAUREEN
Yes and given where we are with
the Dad...and the Manhattan house
is more than we need right now,
I’ve taken your counsel, and I
think selling the house and art to
James and Brian is the right thing
to do. I signed the places you
marked for me.
She hands the manila envelope to Matthew.
MATT
Then it’s done.
MAUREEN
Some of those pieces are quite
large, how will they be displayed?
MATT
(abashed)
Well, you know, James's family
owns a series of retirement
communities around the country and
they're going to donate the art to
these facilities as a write-off.
MAUREEN
(hesitates)
Oh...OK. I can’t believe Danny is
happy about that and Jean...well,
who knows what Jean feels about
anything.

114
MATT
(trying to rationalize)
Well, with Dad’s illness...I
thought I’d wait until after the
show to tell them anything...I
don’t know, there’s been so much
going on...
MAUREEN
Really they have no power anyway.
I don’t know what happened to them
as children -- Harold says he
tried his best -- but they’re
really such disappointments.
MATT
(sadly)
Nobody took care of them.
Maureen nods.
MAUREEN
I say that as a disappointment
myself. I was neglected too
during my childhood. It’s funny,
I was never interested in having
kids. Maybe once. No, not even
once.
(drinks)
You’re very good at getting the
most for your clients.
MATT
It’s what I do.
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. MORNING
Danny, Matt, and Jean climb out of Danny's Subaru.
MATT
Eliza texted, she came early to be
with Dad.
DANNY
She texted you?

JEAN
The curator is meeting us at
Bard at one. So, let's get
Eliza, say our good-byes to
Dad and get on the road.

A car door slams. They look: An old, frail man, 80's, is
being lifted by his burly, muscular male nurse from the
passenger seat.

115

Oh good.

MATT
Paul came.

DANNY
Paul Epstein? I always liked
Paul. Man, he's gotten older.
MATT
I'm glad Dad still has friends.
(heading in the old man's
direction)
I'm going to say, Hi.
DANNY
(over his shoulder)
Jean, you remember Paul and Lori?
Jean?

DANNY
CUT TO:
TITLE:
(Jean's Story)
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
Jean wanders around the cement columns as she talks.
JEAN
I wrote a short story about this
once, but I never finished it and
it wasn't very good. You remember
that summer I visited Dad on
Martha's Vineyard? Dad never
invited me or Danny-Never.

DANNY (O.S.)
JEAN
--that summer I was a camp
counselor at French Woods in
Vermont--

JEAN
--to the summer places but-DANNY (O.S.)
Was that the one with Alisa
Lirtzman?

JEAN
No, that was Thoreau. I was only
at this one for one summer-- And I
had two days off, and I called him
and he couldn't say, No. He must
have gotten permission from your
mother-- It wasn't as convenient
as I had thought.
(MORE)

116
JEAN (CONT'D)
I had to take two buses and a
ferry. When I arrived nobody met
me. I hitchhiked to the other side
of the island. When I got to the
house it was already night and the
adults were all going out for
dinner. Dad and your Mom and L.J.
and Maya and Paul and Lori. Julia
said something about me having my
bags in the way. They were happy
to have a baby-sitter, so they left
me with the kids. You were there,
Matthew, and Loretta and some other
kids I didn't know. We watched
Three's Company on TV. The next
day, Dad played tennis and worked
in his studio. I went down to the
beach with the kids. I got to swim
in the ocean which was really
special for me. I loved that.
Later, I showered in the outdoor
shower with my suit on. And I
realized someone was watching me.
It was Paul. He smiled at me,
almost politely and then he lowered
his tight bathing suit, took out
his penis and started stroking it.
Oh God.

MATT
Paul did?!

DANNY

JEAN
I watched him until he finished.
Then he walked away.
DANNY
Did you tell anyone?
JEAN
I told Dad that night and he asked
if Paul had touched me and I said,
No. He thought we should probably
just leave it then, they were going
back to the City soon anyway. But
that if Paul did it again, he'd
punch him in the nose. The next
day when I was leaving, I looked
around for Dad to say goodbye, but
he was playing tennis. I thought
about telling your Mom, Matthew,
but I was afraid she'd get angry at
me. I remember crying on my way to
the ferry.

117
Matt and Danny look stunned.
MATT
Jean, can I ask you a question?
Why do you always show up for Dad?
Why are you always HERE?
JEAN
(shrugs and says matterof-factly)
Because I’m a decent person. Even
though he never took care of
us...it’s what you do. Besides, I
like hanging out with you guys.
Matt and Danny awkwardly try to hug her.

She wriggles

JEAN
I'm going to smoke.
INT. ICU HALLWAY
Paul, aided heavily by his burly nurse, shuffles toward
Harold's room.
DANNY (O.S.)
Do we kick the shit out of him?
MATT (O.S.)
He's eighty. We'd kill him.
Danny and Matt watch from a distance.
DANNY
That's true. Or hurt him very
badly.
MATT
And neither of us can take that
nurse.
DANNY
That's for sure.
(starting toward the
room)
I'm going to spit on him.
MATT
(holding him back)
No, I know what to do.

118
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
Matthew grabs a wooden branch, walks over, and smashes it
over Paul's car. It breaks in two.
MATT
But good too!
(grabbing a rock)
You got to try this.
Oww!

Danny comes forward, brandishing his metal cane and smashes
the roof with it. Danny looks at it, bent.
DANNY
Shit, this is Maureen’s dead exhusband’s cane.
Matt chucks the rock, cracking the windshield.

DANNY
I've never done anything like
this!

Me neither!
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY
They run inside, high on adrenaline.

What's that blood?
bleeding?

Who's

They stop and check themselves.
DANNY
I don't see it.
Your hand?
Oh, yeah.

MATT
DANNY
And your face.

MATT
(wipes blood from his
chin)
Yeah.

DANNY
(thrusts his now bent
aluminum cane in the
air)
Yeah!

119
MATT
That felt great.
DANNY
I don't know why we don't do that
more.

Pam!

MATT
(suddenly)
Pam is talking to another nurse in the hallway. She
startles then smiles somewhat uneasily as they both rush
toward her bursting with enthusiasm. They both hug her.
MATT
Last night his blood
pressure was at 173 but they
gave him Hydrolozene--

DANNY
And an extra dose of
Lopressor--

MATT
And got it down to 155.
Oh good.

PAM
DANNY
That sounds OK? He's also
on Kepra and Morphine and...

MATT
It's in our notes.

DANNY
Eliza's got the notes. Did you
meet Eliza? She's my daughter.
(lowering his voice)
He has sepsis, Pam.
Oh, no.

PAM
MATT
And that's after the coma.
Oh...

PAM
I'm sorry.

DANNY
Drug induced! Phenobarbital.
MATT
Pento actually-DANNY
I thought it was Phenobarbital--

MATT
What does it matter, we don't know
what either of them are anyway?

OK. I'll make sure to look in on
him...
MATT
It's so good to see you.

Are you bleeding?
INT. ICU HOSPITAL ROOM
The brothers poke their heads in.
DANNY
Umm, Eliza, we need to go.
ELIZA
(looking up)
Um...
DANNY
What?
Paul is sobbing at Harold's bedside. The burly nurse
gently rubbing his back. Matt and Danny hesitate. Danny
indicates for Eliza to follow. She rises.
ELIZA
(crying)
Bye Grandpa. I'll be back in two
weekends. I love you. I forgive
you. Forgive me-Come on!

DANNY
BURLY NURSE
(to Paul)
We should be getting on too.
No!

DANNY

Paul looks up.

MATT
No, could you stay here for
at least ten or fifteen
minutes more, you think?

He stares at Danny and Matt strangely.

121
PAUL
Is that Harold's brothers?
MATT
We're his sons.
Matthew.

Danny and

You look just like him.
BURLY NURSE

The brothers run.

Eliza behind them.

MATT
Let's go tell Jean!
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
Danny, who holds his bloody hand, and Matt stand excitedly
in front of Jean. They're both sweating.
DANNY
Smashed it.
What?

JEAN
MATT
(points across the lot)
Look!
ELIZA
(aside to Matt)
He has dementia.
What?

MATT

DANNY
(to Jean)
We thought you'd be happy.

JEAN
Why would I be happy about this?
You smashed a sick old man's car.
(re: Danny's hand)
Let's get you a bandage.
DANNY
(jumping up and down)
I don't want a bandage. I want to
let it bleed. Let's go to Bard!

122
MATT
He has dementia?
ELIZA
(nods)
Yeah.
MATT
He has dementia.
DANNY
Well, he didn't have dementia when
he molested Jean.
JEAN
He didn't molest me.
DANNY
(losing steam)
But let's not minimize it, Jean.
What he did was shitty and
damaging and I don't know...that
same asshole is in there
somewhere... Right? Beneath the
dementia.
JEAN
I’m glad you guys feel better.
Unfortunately I’m still fucked up.
DANNY
Do you want to take a swing?
JEAN
I could smash every car in this
parking lot and burn the hospital
down and it wouldn’t un-fuck me
up.
(silence)
You guys will never understand
what it’s like to be me in this
family.
(opening her door)
Let's go to Bard.
INT. BARD GALLERY. DAY
A mix of faculty, students, artists and out-of-towners
mingle amongst the work. Eliza gathers with her friends
and Jean.
And older woman, Hilma Federman, says to another teacher.

123
HILMA
He voted against my chairmanship,
but I always liked him.
From across the room an attractive woman, 30's, talking
with a group, smiles at Matt.
Matt, in his suit with a tie, smiles back. He stands in
front of Harold's bronze sculpture which is prominently
displayed.
DANNY (O.S.)
This toast is really stressing me
out.
Danny appears and hands Matt a champagne. Danny wears his
leather jacket over a shirt and tie and khakis with a
hummus stain on the fly. Jean passes by on her way to the
bar.
DANNY
Jean, you sure you don't want to
say anything?
Fuck no.

JEAN
Matt fishes into his pocket and produces the two pills.
MATT
I've had these for a while but I
think they’re still good. Want
one?
DANNY
What will it do to me?
MATT
It will either bring you up or
down. Hopefully down, I guess?
DANNY

Someone took a bite already?
MATT
That was me. I had a crumb when I
last saw Dad.

Oh, OK.

What did it do to you then?

Made me annoyed at Dad?

Matt and Danny each take a pill and down it with champagne.
A blonde kid drapes his arm around Eliza's neck. Danny
frowns.
DANNY
What about Marcus?
MATT
They broke up.
DANNY
How do you know that--

MATT
This woman keeps smiling at
me.

The attractive woman is smiling at Matt.
MATT
I'm getting a real energy from
her.
Suddenly, she excuses herself from her conversation and
walks toward them.
DANNY
She's walking over here.
Matt runs his hand through his hair.
I look OK?

MATT
DANNY
Yeah, you look handsome.
Matt places his drink on Harold’s sculpture. Danny quickly
removes it. She approaches Matt, her face blushing.
WOMAN
Are you Harold Meyerowitz's son?
Yes.

This is Danny, also Harold

Where's Loretta?
L.J.
Her son got chicken-pox and she had
to stay in town! She was very
disappointed.
DANNY
(disappointed)
That's too bad.

MATT
I never got chicken pox.

L.J.
You should call her, Dan.
she'd like to see you.

I know

DANNY
(resolute)
I'm going to.
L.J.
You'd like her boyfriend too.
He's a good man. A screenwriter.
EXT. BARD GALLERY. DAY
Matt pursues Danny outside.
MATT
Don't beat yourself up.

127
DANNY
I should never have left that
opening at MOMA. It was
just...Dad... I felt obligated.
MATT
You thought you were doing the
right thing...
DANNY
You would've stayed.
MATT
I probably would've, yeah. But I
would have felt bad about it. But
it's a good lesson: Dad can take
care of himself. You have to take
care of yourself.
DANNY
No, he can't, Matt. That's why
he's where he is now.
(beating himself up)
I should've been able to tell
something was wrong. I just
thought he was getting old...
MATT
Shit, I yelled at him. The guy
was suffering and I screamed at
him on the street. There's no
catharsis in shouting at an old
person who's dying.
DANNY
Do you think he's going to die?
ELIZA (O.S.)
Dad, I want you to meet someone,
this is Robin.
Eliza and Robin, the blonde boy, stand by the door with
drinks. Robin smokes. Danny approaches, Matt behind him.
DANNY
(shaking hands)
Nice to meet you.
ROBIN
(trying to sound adult)
You too. Eliza speaks very highly
of you.

128
DANNY
Oh...OK.
(to Eliza)
You speak highly of me?
ELIZA
You know what he means.
Eliza cracks open a beer.
DANNY
Eliza, you've had two wines
already, don't have a beer too.
ELIZA
I can handle it.
DANNY
Eliza, it's not good to mix wine
and beer. You'll feel cruddy
tomorrow. I'm telling you.
ELIZA
I've done it before, Dad.
MATT
Maybe she's right, maybe she has a
constitution that can handle the
grape and the grain.
DANNY
Please, just...stay out of this.
ELIZA
Matt's right, I have the fortitude
for it.
DANNY
I'm telling you, you're going to
feel like crap.
Eliza takes a swallow. Danny grabs the beer from her, and
chucks it. Robin looks scared.
ELIZA
What the fuck, man?!
She storms back inside the gallery.

Robin trailing behind.

MATT
What does it matter if she drinks
wine and beer?

129
DANNY
Stop interfering with my
parenting, Matt.
MATT
She's eighteen. What "parenting"
do you need to do here? She's
just a person now.
DANNY
This is something I do and I'm
quite good at it, OK? She and I
have a very good relationship when
you're not around. So, stop...
ganging up on me.
Matt reaches out and takes Danny's shoulder.
MATT
(trying to diffuse)
I'm sorry. You know, I've enjoyed
hanging out recently.
DANNY
Yeah? Me too. You know, I've
wanted to apologize for a long
time.
For what?

MATT
DANNY
I'm pissed at myself because when
Dad kicked me out of the house and
I moved back with my mom, you
really made an effort to hang out
and I kind of blew you off. And I
feel like I fucked that up. I
think it's really my fault that
we're not close.
Danny hugs Matt strangely.
DANNY
It was hard for me to be around
Dad and your mom at that time too.
They were so critical of me and I
was just FAILING.
MATT
(trying to end it)
We should go back in, give our
toasts.

130
DANNY
(oddly)
Are you disappointed in me?
MATT
No, no.

What?

They both wander, moving, circling -- there's restless pent
up energy that's slowly being released by both of them.
DANNY
I know Dad is. But I felt like
you maybe also were critical of me
for quitting piano and-MATT
No, no, no. You were my big
brother, I looked up to you.
DANNY
I quit because it was my protest.
OK?
OK.

MATT
Like McEnroe.

DANNY
And also...because it was
like...it was like walking
barefoot through broken glass to
get to a milkshake. I loved the
milkshake but, you know, my feet
were...bleeding.
MATT
I can understand that.
DANNY
Can you? Cause my feeling about
you is you can't. It's not your
fault but like Dad, you make me
feel really bad about myself.
I'm sorry.

MATT
DANNY
I said it's not your fault.
MATT
(leaning back toward the
gallery building)
Let's go in.

131
DANNY
Can I ask you something?
MATT
(uh-oh)
What?
DANNY
A few years ago, when Karen and I
had you over to our house when you
were in town and I never heard
from you afterwards. Maybe you
didn't like the food or Karen or I
insulted you in some way. Karen
maybe had too much grappa-MATT
No! That was nice. I went back
to LA, I don't know.
DANNY
Were you bored? Most people seem
to find us interesting enough,
we've had no complaints.
MATT
It's nothing like that. It's
just...life...it's not more than
that.
DANNY
Well, even in life, you can make an
effort. Write an e-mail from one
of your phones. But, I guess
you're fine making no effort with
family. You say you have guilt,
but...
MATT
(angry)
I'm here now. I'm in fucking
Rhinebeck. I was just in
Pittsfield. I've been HERE.
DANNY
(emotional)
It shouldn't come to that! And if
Dad survives, you'll go back to LA
and I'm going to be taking care of
him for a very long time.
MATT
We'll all help out.

132
DANNY
No...we won't ALL. It'll be me.
And Jean. And mainly me.
MATT
I'll come more often.
DANNY
That's what you said when you ate
dinner with Karen and me.
(walking away)
You've made your priorities clear.
MATT
You know what: I'm tired of
apologizing for doing well.
DANNY
Ptolemy asked me why you never
talk Dad's work up to your wealthy
clients. He says you could be
really helpful, that it's all
perception. You know, he's a good
artist and there's no reason he
isn't as well known as L.J.!
MATT
Maybe it's not my responsibility
to help Dad. Maybe THAT.
DANNY
No, it's what you DO.
MATT
And ALSO maybe he's not so great.
Maybe he's undiscovered for a
reason. Maybe THAT! The truth is
we DON'T KNOW, Danny. We were
brainwashed.
DANNY
Why are you so angry at him
anyway. He loves everything you
do.
Does he?

MATT
He doesn't tell me that.

DANNY
He tells ME. I should be angry at
him. I should hate him for
treating me and Jean like second
class citizens.

133
MATT
Then why don't you?!

You SHOULD.

He holds Danny's shoulder again, and says more tenderly.
MATT
Listen, you and Jean are going to
get some money. We got a great
deal on the house and all of the
art and I’m giving my share to both
of you. It doesn’t make up for
everything but you guys really
deserve this.
Danny slips from Matt's grasp, angry.
DANNY
Dad said this was a family
discussion! Wait...did this...did
this happen already?
Yes.

MATT
It’s done.

DANNY
He told me we’d decide
together. And you do this
when he can’t say
anything... He told me,
Matt. You weren’t there.

MATT
If we didn’t do something, we'd be
spending the next few years
throwing his work in dumpsters.
This way we get something for it.
DANNY
I don’t care about money. That
house, that work MEANS something
to me.
MATT
You should embrace this. I should
be the one who cares. I grew up
there. That’s MY house. I SHOULD
care.
DANNY
Then why don’t you?
MATT
Because...I don’t know... You’re
probably right, I should care.
Maybe I do... Maybe I do...
(hesitates)
(MORE)

134
MATT (CONT'D)
But this makes sense, they're going
to donate the art as a tax writeoff. James's family owns a series
of retirement communities around
the country-DANNY
How could you do this to him? Who
could even dream up such a plan?!
Me!

MATT
It's what I do for a living.

Danny shoves Matt.

Matt shoves him back.

DANNY
Ptolemy said you guys make
yourselves indispensable to
vulnerable rich people.
MATT
Why don't you tell me more about my
business? Danny, I really want YOU
or DAD or FUCKING Ptolemy to tell
ME about what I do every day for a
living.
Matt pushes Danny.
Oww!

Danny kicks him in the leg.

MATT
You kicked me in the shin.

And now they're scuffling awkwardly.
MATT
(blurting out)
I WAS disappointed in you for
quitting piano.
Danny swings wildly at him.
MATT
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I know it's hard, it's hard for
all of us. GET IT TOGETHER!
DANNY
(now, just shouting
insults)
And you're doing with Tony just
what Dad did with me and Jean.

Matt slaps Danny hard across the face then slips on the
grass and lands on his ass. Danny tackles him and they
topple onto the lawn hitting each other awkwardly.
People emerge from the gallery.

DANNY
He collapses on the ground.
MATT (V.O.)
We want to thank Bard for making
this show happen.
INT. BARD GALLERY
Matt, bloody, his suit torn, and still picking grass out of
his hair addresses the crowd. He consults note cards and
talks smoothly and professionally despite his appearance.
MATT
And thank many of you for making
the trip. My Dad, and I'm sure
every artist involved in this
show, would be really pleased.
Jean indicates for him to address the bleeding coming from
his nose. Matt wipes it on his arm.

136
MATT
My father was a teacher here for
thirty-three years so this is
particularly special for him. And
this piece is special for me as
it's called Matthew. My father
tells a story of how this piece
came to be. How I would sit on
the hardwood floor of his studio,
getting nails in my ass, and hand
him tools and make suggestions and
he would let me help or let me
THINK I was helping and when it
was done he said we had made it
together. Even though I don’t
remember this time, he does. But
I remember that feeling. Of being
very proud. Of wanting to be an
artist like my dad. Of being
included -- he was interested in
me, he...loved me...
(he wipes tears from his
face)
I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm...
I've been angry at him for so much
of my adult life. I guess I was
trying to outrun him. But I didn’t
-- I’m still that boy helping my
Dad. And he loved me. Even if it
wasn’t how I wanted him to love me,
he loved me. And I’ve given away
his life’s work--it’s gone...
(to Danny and Jean)
I’m sorry. And if Dad doesn’t
make it, he and I aren’t OK. We
never got to be OK...
Danny is there beside him now, holding Matt in his arms.
Matt continues to cry like a baby.
MATT
(to the audience, trying
to sound intelligible,
but just crying)
Danny, do you want to say a few
words...
DANNY
Yes, thank you, Matthew.
He holds out the mike for Danny to take.
anticipating a punch.

Danny flinches,

137
MATT
No, I'm giving this to you...
DANNY
Oh, I see, OK.
Danny takes the mike. Eliza and Jean help Matt to a bench.
Now, Danny, also bloody, clothes torn, looks petrified. He
hums an indecipherable tune. He leans on the back of a
chair for support.
DANNY
You'll have to bear with me as I'm
not a good public speaker and also
I've never done it. It's something
I've gone to great pains to avoid.
When I used to perform music in
front of an audience it was just
too excruciating. The reward was
just not worth the self-hatred.
Not to mention, unlike my brother,
Matthew, I find this particular
piece painful because it was during
a time I wasn't really speaking to
my Dad. He had left my mother and
Jean and me, gotten remarried to
Matt's mom whom we did not like.
Again, unlike Matt, I was NOT
included in the art-making process,
it wasn't MINE too... This piece
is NOT called Danny. In fact,
there are NO Danny's.
Or Jeans!

JEAN (O.S.)
DANNY
(nods)
For me, it's a symbol of what I
will NEVER be able to do. A club I
will NEVER be admitted to. But Dad
and I have gotten to spend more
time together as adults and that's
been good, I think we have gotten
closer. We've certainly watched a
lot of Mets games. Some of you
know, my Dad is in a hospital in
Pittsfield and we don't know how
it's all going to go. Our doctor's
in China and the only really good
nurse got reassigned to a different
floor. Maybe I need to believe my
Dad was a genius because I don't
want his life to be worthless.
(MORE)

138
DANNY (CONT'D)
If he's not a great artist, that
means he was just a prick. I think
he's good, though. I think he
deserved more attention than he
got. I think that's true. Matt?
Matt, eyes bloodshot, face splotchy, shrugs.
DANNY
I wish he'd had more success
because it would have made his
life easier. Even if that kind of
thing doesn't ultimately mean
much. I don't know, L.J.?
L.J.
(shrugs)
I don't know either.
I'd tell you.

If I did,

DANNY
Also, I'm really proud of my
daughter, Eliza, who is a freshman
here and a really talented
filmmaker.

Eliza smiles, embarrassed.

DANNY
Thank you.

Peace.

It's wonderful, honey. I don't

Well, that's difficult.

Bruno-(to Matt)
Did you change your scent?

Maybe a new shampoo?

exercises. Bruno!

I

MATT
How's he doing?
MAUREEN
The earliest appointment we can
get with the neurologist is next
month...
It's a lot for me to do
by myself here.
She enters the house through the kitchen.

Matt follows.

MAUREEN
Fortunately we have a little more
money from the sale. James sent
photos of the sculptures at one of
the retirement homes in Arizona.
They look quite stunning.
(pause)
I have to say I was very surprised
that you tried to stop the deal
after you went through all that
trouble setting it up...
MATT
I just thought...I changed my
mind.
MAUREEN
Well, it was my decision as I’m
the next of kin. It’s too late
now.
She retrieves the black Vuarnet sunglasses from a pile of
odds and ends and hands them to Matt.
MAUREEN
I found these in the Dad's things.
I think they're yours.
MATT
They're Danny's.

143
He puts them in his jacket pocket. Maureen enters the
dining room. There are papers strewn across the table.
MAUREEN
I just have to finish these
insurance forms which seem to be
written in a foreign language-MATT
Maureen, why didn't you ask me,
someone at my company will do
that.
She looks up, tears falling from her eyes.
MAUREEN
(emotionally)
I don't like to ask for help.
MATT
(softly)
Let me do it, OK?
He steps forward about to place his hand on her shoulder,
but she quickly recovers and heads for the door.
MAUREEN
But it's a big day, it's the Dad's
first meal off of the feeding
tube.
INT. MAUREEN’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM
Matt follows into the living room.

Harold is watching TV.

MAUREEN
He's watching TCM.
Matt hesitates. His Dad looks older and wears a knit cap.
There's a weariness and frailty he carries now.
Hey, Dad.
Hi.

MATT
HAROLD
MATT
What are you watching?
HAROLD
I don't know.
Matt sits down next to him and they watch.

144
HAROLD
In these 30's movies the men wore
tuxedos all the time. Things have
gotten much more casual.
MATT
Maybe they dressed up because they
lived shorter lives back then.
They wanted to celebrate life.
LATER
INT. MAUREEN’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM
Matt and Maureen sit beside Harold who lies in a bed made
from the pull-out couch. Bruno sleeps on the floor. They
eat take-out Chinese food. Harold eats quickly, his bites
large.
MAUREEN
We spent three hours today at
Goodwill. The Dad had a funny
joke.
HAROLD
What was that? Oh.
MAUREEN
I'll set you up again: We spent
three hours today at Goodwill.
HAROLD
Which pretty much destroyed mine.
Ha.

MATT
That's good, Dad.

Thank you.

HAROLD
MATT
You should see the other dog.
Harold has no reaction.
MAUREEN
That's true, the Dad got very
impatient. And as we were handing
over the boxes, I saw that I had
accidentally included my good wok.
And I hesitated. But I thought, I
haven't made Chinese food in ten
years.
(MORE)

145
MAUREEN (CONT'D)
I won't make Chinese food
again...but you have your idea of
yourself and you want to hold onto
that.
Harold erupts with a guttural cough.
MATT
Dad, are you OK?

Yes.

HAROLD
(spitting food back on
his plate)
MATT
Take it easy.
MAUREEN
We just got you out of the
hospital, we don't want you to go
back.
HAROLD
It was very unpleasant in the
hospital.
Uh huh.

MATT
HAROLD
You know, I was there for a couple
of months.
I know.

MATT
HAROLD
Maureen has been my savior.
MAUREEN
Harold, you're getting brown sauce
all over the sheets.
Harold wipes at the sheet.
MAUREEN
You're just rubbing it in.
Maureen sighs and gathers the plates.
MAUREEN
Matt can you help the Dad get
ready for his nap?

146
MATT
Sure. I’m going to try to come
visit more. It’s hard, because
Tony starts kindergarten this
year, and I want to be around for
that, but... I’ll try to be here
more.
HAROLD
L.J. is coming for lunch in a
couple of weeks, you should come
for that.
Maureen heads into the other room.
HAROLD
He left me a very effusive message
about my show. And someone wrote
a rave on my Google. It was quite
inspired of you to set that up.
MATT
Jean and Danny organized it, Dad.
HAROLD
Is that right? But you made the
sale.
MATT
Yeah, that was me. But, I bought
a piece back from Brian and James
at a significant mark up, I might
add.
It’s the piece from the
show, “Matthew” because...
”Matthew” and we did it together.
(formal but from the
heart)
Thank you for letting me be part
of your process. It had a big
effect on me, Dad. Your
confidence was contagious. I
think it’s why I’m able to do what
I do now.
HAROLD
I remember I made “Matthew” in
1966, the year the Whitney bought
my piece.
CLOSE on Matthew.
MATT
It couldn't have been 1966.

147
HAROLD
It was, I didn't work in bronze
after that.
MATT
I wasn't born yet.
HAROLD
(the impact of this lost
on him)
Oh...that's right, isn't it, then
it couldn't have been you watching
me, could it. Maybe it was your
brother.
Matthew hesitates.
HAROLD
I guess I wanted it to be you.
MATT
You should have called it “Danny.”
HAROLD
You’re right. I should have. I'm
going to sleep now. Can you close
that shade?
OK.

MATT
Matt rises and pulls the shade.
HAROLD (O.S.)
It’s OK if you want to sit here
longer while I fall asleep.
Sure.

MATT
Matt comes around to his father's bedside. His dad removes
his hat and balls himself up in his sleeping position like
an infant.
MATT
I love you Dad.

Matt tucks the covers up to his neck, leans down and kisses
his Dad on the forehead. He sees, hidden in his father’s
hair, the scar from the surgery.

I can get work done this way.
DANNY
How is Dad?
MATT
I don’t know, still Dad. But I
was sitting there and I just kept
having this thought. This is my
Dad. This is my...Dad. This is
the same guy as all the other
times. And that thought which has
made me so angry also made me love
him.
DANNY
I said goodbye to him so many times
in my head, it's strange, in a way,
I wasn't prepared for him to
survive.
MATT
Well, now we’ll know what to do
the next time. The three of us
had a real rhythm going...
DANNY
I just don't want to have to speak
publicly again. You know,
sometimes I wish Dad had done one
horrible, unforgivable thing.
Something specific I could be
angry about. But it isn't one
thing. It's tiny things every
day. It's drip, drip, drip...

149
MATT
I'm sorry... I couldn't stop the
house and the art from being sold.
In the end, Maureen was
determined.
DANNY
(shrugs)
I'm over it.
I'm not.

MATT
Matt rises and removes the Vuarnet sunglasses from his
coat.
MATT
I think these are your Vuarnets.
DANNY
(takes them)
I thought they were yours.

MATT
(hesitates)
Maybe they were mine.

DANNY
No, I think you're right,
they're mine.

MATT
(reaching for them)
I'm remembering now owning
them.

DANNY
(pulling them away)
They look like a pair I probably
had.
Danny puts them on.

Matt regards him.

MATT
You can have them anyway.
DANNY
Can you help me walk? The nurse
is supposed to be here to do it,
but I get antsy.
Matt helps Danny climb out of the bed.
MATT
I loved Eliza's new movie.
DANNY
It's good, right.
MATT
You've done a great job with her.

DANNY
Thanks. You know, I'm glad she
likes you so much...
Danny holds Matt's arm as he slowly walks.
MATT
Hey, when you get out, do you want
to come to LA?
DANNY
Oh...hmm...I love Los Angeles. I
haven't been there, but I love it.
MATT
You could stay with me, see what
you think. You know, the weather
is nice, I could get you a ticket
and in a couple of weeks-DANNY
I don't know, I think I should
stay and help Maureen with Dad. I
have sympathy for her but I don’t
trust her.
MATT
Well, if you change your mind...
They continue into the hospital hallway.
INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL HALLWAY
MATT
I was going to stay here longer,
but I think I should leave tonight
and get back to Tony because...I
want to be a Dad like you.
DANNY
Yeah, go be with your boy.
(pause)
Thanks for...you know, taking care
of me.
MATT
(shrugs, smiles)
It's what you do.

INT. MAUREEN'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM, PITTSFIELD. DAY
Harold sits, partially slumped, at the breakfast table.
HAROLD
Maureen went into town for
groceries a few hours ago...
Danny places a plate of blueberry pancakes in front of him.
He walks with a cane.
DANNY
The famous blueberry pancakes.
Danny does the flourish.
HAROLD
I don't know what she could be
doing...
DANNY
How's her drinking?
HAROLD
I've made her a deal, I said, we'd
put in a pool if she stopped
drinking.
DANNY
(unsure)
Uh huh.
HAROLD
You know, since the Bard show,
Matthew has personally invested in
a a piece of mine.
DANNY
You should have seen Matt, Dad,
when you were sick. He was there
the whole time, he really whipped
us into shape.
Harold gets up and walks into the living room.
male nurse's aide who is cleaning up.
HAROLD
I think you and Jean should look
into getting me a solo show. That
would really put me back on the
map.

They pass a

DANNY
You know, we were all there the
whole time.
Harold sits on the couch and presses the remote.
HAROLD
(ignoring him)
Every time I turn on TCM, it's
Meet Me in Saint Louis. What's on
the premium channels?
DANNY
It was rough there for a minute,
we thought we might lose you.
HAROLD
There's something called Sex Tape
on Starz. Do you know anything
about that?
DANNY
(giving up)
Not really.
HAROLD
Shall we give it a try?
He places down the remote and settles in.
HAROLD
Maureen is leaving for Cuba on
Monday. I thought you could stay
with me while she's away.
DANNY
You know, Matt invited me to LA.
HAROLD
I'm still recovering.

I really

DANNY
Have you ever been to LA?
HAROLD
You're still recovering too. And,
you know, we've got the premium
channels now. We get the Knicks.
DANNY
I know. I lived here while you
were in the hospital.

DANNY (CONT'D)
(helps with a pillow)
You'll have a nurse with you-HAROLD
You know, I really need you to
stay with me. I'm asking you to
do this, please. You know I don’t
like asking for things. I need
you, Danny.

OK.

DANNY
(hesitates)
HAROLD
I think there are still some of
Jean's cookies in the kitchen if
you take a look-Danny goes into the kitchen. The male nurse's aide is
doing dishes. Danny nods at him.
HAROLD (O.S.)
I'll take you to lunch one day
this week at Babalouies which is
the best pizza in the Berkshires.
Maybe the best pizza period.
DANNY
OK, thanks.
He picks up the plate of cookies-HAROLD (O.S.)
Pick a day. Except for next
Saturday, L.J. is coming up for
lunch, so you'll need to find
something to do, but you can go to
a movie or, I think there's
bowling.
Danny throws the plate of cookies onto the ground,
startling everybody including himself.
DANNY
(to the nurse's aide)
Sorry.

Danny!

HAROLD
What are you doing?

Danny stands in the doorway.
DANNY
Sorry, Dad, I didn't think that
would be so loud.

154
HAROLD
See if you can rescue some of the
cookies from the porcelain.
DANNY
I'm leaving now, Dad. I'm going
to drive back to the city-(again to the aide)
You'll be here, right?
Yes.

NURSE'S AIDE
DANNY
I'll clean this up, don't worry.
(back to his Dad)
And then I'm going to LA to see
Matthew.
(and to himself)
"I love you." "I forgive you."
"Forgive me." "Thank you." "Goodbye."

INT. TOWN CAR. DAY
Danny grabs a handful of complimentary gum from a tray and
puts it in his pocket.
DANNY
The flight leaves at 4:30, you
think we'll be OK?
DRIVER
Yes, traffic looks fine. And
you're business class, so check-in
is quicker.
DANNY
I've never flown business class.
I've never done business. My
brother had miles.
He removes the Vuarnet sunglasses from his pocket and puts
them on. He gazes out the window.
Loretta, in a sweater and jeans, walks briskly down the
street, holding herself against the cold.

155
DANNY
(suddenly)
Can you stop the car!
EXT. MANHATTAN STREET
Loretta continues walking.
Loretta!

DANNY (O.S.)
Loretta's mouth widens into a big smile. Danny emerges
from the town car wearing his big Vuarnet sunglasses and
holding a cane.
LORETTA
Danny!
(they hug)
I'm consulting for a client around
the corner and I just ran out for
a tea without my coat! What are
you doing in Stuy Town?
DANNY
Just going for a ride with my
chauffeur. No, I'm kidding...
Um, I'm on my way out to the
coast.
The coast?

LORETTA

DANNY
(embarrassed)
Los Angeles.

LORETTA
Los Angeles, really?
DANNY
Yeah, thus the town car. Matthew
got it for me. I usually take the
A train.
(removing the glasses and
indicating the car)
This is not representative of
where I am in my life.
Loretta laughs and touches his arm affectionately.
DANNY
I'm going to stay with Matthew for
a while...
LORETTA
Oh, that sounds nice, get out of
this weather.

DANNY
Yeah...I don't know.

I like

LORETTA
I know, me too, I don't know why I
said that.
(pause)
What's this cane?
DANNY
Oh...it's this affectation, I'm
trying...NO, no...new hip.
LORETTA
Oh wow, Dan. Are you OK?
DANNY
Yeah...better. I did my best to
ignore it, but the hip won out.
LORETTA
(realizing)
Oh my God, how's your Dad?
DANNY
He's OK. He's out of the
hospital.
LORETTA
That's great. My Dad was worried.
DANNY
Yeah...he's better...health-wise,
otherwise...the same.
LORETTA
Sometimes they're just the same,
aren't they?
DANNY
Yeah. He's still waiting for his
life to begin.
LORETTA
Oh no, but he's done so well,
don't you think?
DANNY
(honestly)
I don't know, has he?

157
LORETTA
He has. He taught for all those
years at Bard -- I used to love
hearing him talk about art, he made
good work, his kids are great...
It's a shame he can't feel that
way.
CLOSE on Danny.
DANNY
(realizes)
Yeah.
(suddenly)
There's so much I believed without
knowing I believed it.
They both smile silently.
LORETTA
I guess it doesn’t matter if your
parents are alive or dead, we’re
still trying to change the ending,
aren’t we? But you look
different, Dan. I can’t put my
finger on it. And it’s not just
the limo.
DANNY
L.J. mentioned you were seeing a
screenwriter-LORETTA
Oh yeah...that didn't take. You
know, after my divorce, I don't
know what I'm doing. I'm single
now.
DANNY
(abruptly)
I won't be leaving New York for
good. I'll be back.
LORETTA
That's what everyone says when
they go to LA and then it's twenty
years later.
DANNY
See you in twenty years.
Ha.

LORETTA

158
DANNY
No, I have to come back for
Eliza's freshman film festival
anyway in a month.
LORETTA
Can I come?
DANNY
Yeah, it's at Bard.
LORETTA
I'd love to come.
DANNY
It's, uh, not un-pornographic, I'm
warning you.
LORETTA
I'm in the art-world, I've seen it
all.
DANNY
She's really talented, I think.
You know, I think she's got
something...
LORETTA
I'm sure she does.

It's a

LORETTA
Well, that's something to look
forward to, isn't it?
I/E. WHITNEY MUSEUM. DAY
Eliza and Robin shove one another playfully and make their

INT. WHITNEY MUSEUM. DEEP STORAGE
An art handler, holding a slip of paper, leads Eliza and
Robin down a long, cramped, crowded hall of painting and
sculpture packed away and stored on various levels. We

They arrive at a crate.
