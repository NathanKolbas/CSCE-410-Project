Now and Then
(The Gaslight Addition)

By Marlene King

October 19, 1994

The Gaslight Addition

EXT.  Indiana - Early Evening

The sun sits low in the sky and the rolling hillsides take on a golden glow. A rental car cruises downa lonely road which cuts through the countryside. The car passes through an old covered bridge.

Int. Car 

Deep in thought, Samantha Albertson puffs on a cigarette as she drives. Big city hip, Samantha'spale complexion is only made more noticeable by the black turtleneck she wears. She stamps thecigarette out into an overflowing ashtray. Thrown into the passenger's seat is a laptop computer,cellular phone, filo-fax, rental car contract and a carton of Malboro Reds, Samantha reaches forthe carton as we --

Cut To:
Ext. Doctor's Office - Early Evening

A beeper attached to a belt sounds. We pan up to reveal Dr. Roberta Martin. a 33 year old smalltown family practitioner, as she is about to step into her Jeep Cherokee.  Roberta wears minimalmake up and although it rarely occurs to her, she's a natural beauty. She wears a doctor's smockover faded 501's and has an appealing tomboyish quality about her that often attracts men andwomen. She sighs as she turns off her beeper and heads back into her office.
 
Ext. Shelby - Early Evening

A long stretch limousine rolls past the city limits sign:" Welcome to Shelby -- population 11,550"

Int. Bedroom 

The song plays on the tape player. Pink pumps tap to the music on the high-low shag carpet. Wepan up to reveal 33 year old Chistina Dewitt, a slightly overweight housewife, sitting at her vanity.Avon's been knocking on her door. She wears a pink, polyester ensemble and models hair heightonly a mid-western beautician could achieve. She sings along to the song as she looks at her re-flection. Something's not right. She reaches for a can of "White Rain" and lifts her hair even higher.We hear the front door swing 

Page 2

open and slam shut.

Roberta (O.S.)
Anybody home?

Chrissy
Be right there.

She surveys her look and winks at herself. Hot stuff. Then, slowly she stands. It takes an incredibleeffect because she's very pregnant. Looking like she could birth a baby whale, we realize she's dueany second.

Int. Kitchen 

Roberta sets a case of Bud Light on the counter. She twists open a beer bottle and makes herselfat home. Chrissy enters and Roberta fixates on her huge stomach. She immediately jumps back.

Roberta
Everyone duck, she's gonna blow!

Chrissy rolls her eyes. It's not the first joke she's heard.

Roberta
I think you got bigger overnight.

Chrissy 
Yeah, well if this baby grows another inch, I'm gonna reach in and yank it out myself.

Roberta grimaces at the thought then notices the latest issue of "People" magazine lying on thecounter and picks it up.

Close On: Magazine cover. TV Star, Tina Tercell, remarries her ex-husband. Her fourth marriage infour years.

Chrissy
Can you believe that tramp?

Chrissy loads the beer bottles into the refrigerator.

Chrissy
What does she have that people get so excited about?

Roberta looks at the magazine cover.

Roberta
Long legs, a tiny waist and large, perky breasts.

Page 3
 
Chrissy (reprimanding)
Roberta, you know how I feel about swearing.

Roberta
Chrissy, breast is not a dirty word.

Chrissy covers her ears.

Chrissy 
I can't hear you.

Roberta scans the article.

Chrissy (with skepticism)
It says in there she was orphaned at age seven when her mother died in a freak kitchen accidentand her father ran off with a parish nun.

Roberta
It also says she attributes her three failed marriages to her extreme fear of intimacy (thinkingabout it) I think that's probably true.

Chrissy
Please

Roberta tosses aside the magazine and glances outside. She looks at a magnificent old treehouse which is the focal point of the back yard. Memories. A smile on Roberta's face. Goodmemories. She snaps out of her daydream and turns back to Chrissy.

Roberta
Have you talked to Samantha?

Chrissy
I left another message, but I havent heard from her. She probably thinks she's too good for usnow that she's won that book award.

Roberta
I don't think that's true at all. She's just busy, like the rest of us.

Ext Gaslight Addition 

Samantha's parks her rental car at the curb in front of Chrissy's

Page 4

house. She looks around, taking in the neighborhood.

A twenty year old residential village where identical, single story brick houses sit side by side.Paint-trim and flowers differentiate the Smiths from the Jones. A Gas lamp post stands inthe front yard of every house in the area. Large trees line the streets and garnish the homes.

Samantha (V.O.)
There's a point in your life when something in your past calls and pulls you back. Chrissy's callcame out of the blue, asking me to honor a pact we made the summer I turned 12. I didn't reallywant to go, but as the time grew nearer I realized I had no choice.

With an air of reluctance Samantha grabs a garment bag from the trunk of the car and heads upthe driveway towards the front door. She sets down the bag, hesitates for a moment and then ringsthe doorbell. We hear commotion from the inside the house, then suddenly, the door flings openand Flash!

Samantha is momentarily blinded by the glare of a flashbulb as Chrissy snaps her picture. Robertaopens the door and hugs Samantha hello.

Roberta
It's good to see you.

Samantha
You look great, Roberta!

Samantha turns to Chrissy.

Samantha
And you... A pink pregnant sight to behold.

Samantha (speechless)
Look at you.

Chrissy hugs her.

Chrissy 
Thanks for coming.

Beep Beep!  A car horn blares. They all turn to see a long black limousine pulls into the driveway.Little kids run up to see who's inside. The driver opens the passenger door and out steps TinaTercell. Sexy, blonde bombshell. The kids surround her. She relishes the attention. Tina finallyspots her three, long time friends, warching from the porch.

Page 5

Tina
Hey bitches.

Chrissy (flabbergasted)
My Lord

A hug from Roberta. An air-kiss from Chrissy. And then a moment. Tina and Samantha look ateach other then break into smiles. They share a really big hug.

Samantha 
It's good to see you, Teeny,

Teeny  
It's been too damn long.

Int. Foyer - Living Room - Moments Later

Chrissy waddles as she leads the way into the room. Samantha looks around in amazement.

Samantha (thinking it's weird)
It looks just like it did when your mother lived here. 

Teeny
I was sorry to hear she passed away.

Chrissy (it's still painful)
Thanks.

An awkward silence falls over them and for a moment. It's uncomfortable. We realize they're notthe tight knit group they used to be.

Chrissy
Well, what can I get you two to drink?

Samantha
Whatever.

Teeny
Anything.

Roberta (upbeat)
How about a beer?

Samantha and Teeny
Great

Page 6

Chrissy
Be right back.

Roberta
Let me help.

They leave and Samantha immediately comments on the plastic covered early American decor.

Samantha
Who do you think she takes the plastic off for?
(as Teeny shrugs)
I mean, we're company right? If ever trhere was a time to take off the plastic, this would be it.

Ext. Backyard - Evening

Chrissy's husband fires up the barbecue. Hamburgers and hot dogs sizzle.

The women kick off their shoes and pop open some cold beers. The recapture a glimpse of theirpast as they hang in and around the tree house. Samantha and Teeny rock back and forth onswings, hanging from an overhead branch. Chrissy sips on a Fresca as she sits on the bottomof the aluminum slide protruding out of the tree house. Roberta, inside the tree house, hangs outof a window.

Samantha
I can't believe you kept the tree house.

Chrissy 
Morton wanted to tear it down and put in a "Dough Boy" but I just couldn't part with it.

She looks up at the old tree house with great affection.

Chrissy
Besides, it's not mine to tear down. It belongs to all of us. (incredibly sincere) I really want tothank you guys for showing up  (caressing her round stomach) After two false starts, the thirdtry's got me scared to death.

Page 7

Roberta
You'll be a great mom, Chrissy... Alittle overbearing and rigid, but I'm sure the kid will grow upto be, by the grace of God, well adjusted.

Chrissy gives her a pouty sneer.

Teeny
I can't believe you're having a baby. 

Samantha
Suddenly, I feel so old.  

Teeny
No shit.

Chrissy
Could you try, for one day to express yourself without cursing.

Teeny (annoyed)
What are you, the dialogue police?

Roberta jumps out of the tree house and lands solid on her feet.

Chrissy (disapproving)
Roberta.

Roberta (proud of herself)
Still got it.

Roberta pushes Samantha and Teeny on the swings.

Samantha
This whole baby thing baffles me. I mean you have it. You raise it. You inevitable screw it up.It resents you. It feels guilty for resenting you. Then it has a baby and the vicious cycleperpetuates.

They all look at her and realize her depressing theory.
 
Roberta
Well, that's certainly one way of looking at it.

Samantha ignores Roberta's retort and an uncomfortable silence abounds. Unbeknownst toSamantha, Chrissy looks at the others and gestures Samantha is crazy in the head. Teeny triesto lighten the mood.

Page 8

Teeny
So... Sam,  what are you working on now?

Samantha (sarcastic)
My tan

Roberta flashes a look at Samantha's pale complexion.

Roberta
Maybe you should try a lighter sun block.

Chrissy
If you ask me, you ought to write a book about something people can relate to. I didn'tunderstand half of that last thing of yours I read.

Teeny
She'll take that as a compliment.

Samantha
What's not to understand? It was a comprehensive theoretical analysis of Isaac Asimov's work.

Chrissy
Nobody cares about that crap. Why don't you write a romance novel, like Danielle Steel? Now there'sa lady who knows how to write a page turner.

Samantha and Teeny stares at Chrissy. They exchange looks and bust up laughing.

Chrissy (defensive)
Go ahead and laugh, but the jokes on you, not me.

Teeny
Really? How so?

Chrissy
You two have become very peculiar people.

Teeny
You're just jealous

Chrissy
Of your weirdo life. Not in a quazillion years. It's true, isn;t it Roberta? The longer they're gonethe weirder they get.

Page 9

Roberta
I just think it would be nice to see you guys more often. What's it been? Six years?

Chrissy
Roberta, for example, has chosen to be alternative, but she is still normal. She hasn't beenmarried four times or gone through a series of monogamous relationships...or wear all black?She's happy. Aren't you Roberta?

Roberta (embarrassed and amused)
Uh, yeah.

Roberta attempts to pull a distant Samantha back into the group.

Roberta
Samantha, truth or dare?

Samantha snorts a chuckle.

Samantha (skeptical)
Truth I guess.

Roberta
What were you and Billy Wayne doing in the tree house all night when we had that Fourth of Julyparty here?

A slow smile builds on Samantha's face. The others anticipate hearing the story.

Samantha (playful)
I promised I'd never tell.

The others groan as Samantha laughs. She swings higher and higher. She glides up out of frameand when she glides back -- She is a 12 year old girl. We pull back and see Roberta also now 12pushing Samantha and a 12 year old Teeny on the swings of a colorfull metal 70's swing set.We pan over and see Chrissy at 12 sitting on the bottom of the aluminum slide, braiding herpig tails.

Samantha (V.O.)
Many of us spend our adult lives denying our childhoods. So strongly, we shut ourselves off fromthe very things that might help us understand.

Samantha jumps out of her swing and runs off, quickly followed by Teeny and Roberta. Chrissyfinishes her pig tail and runs off

Page 10

after them, into the house.

Int. Chrissy's House 

Chrissy's mother, Mrs. Dewitt, with stiff set hair and a pink apron to match her outfit, puts thefinishing touches on her pastel desert concoction. We get the feeling she spends a lot of timein the kitchen. The girls grab homemade chocolate chip cookies from a platter on the counterand exchange "hello's and thank you's' with Mrs. Dewitt. They walk through the house, towardsthe front door. As we look around, we notice the house does look exactly the same as we sawin 1994.

Samantha (V.O.)
The summer of 1970 started out like any other summer...school ended and we had three monthsof freedom ahead of us. But that year freedom wasn't enough. We wanted independence. Aplace to call our own. That's why we decided to buy the tree house... and the quest to earn themoney was our summer goal.

As the girls walk out the front door we cut to:

Ext. Gaslight Addition 

The girls exist Chrissy's house and head down the sidewalk. We pan through the neighborhood.It's a lazy summer afternoon in the year 1970. Tiny new trees make the houses look bigger thanthey did during present day. Everything looks perfect and exact. New houses. New Paint. Newlawns and sidewalks.

Samantha (V.O.)
The four of us lived in the Gaslight Addition. It was a dream neighborhood. A brand new pre-planned community when new was in and old was out.

A fresh cut grass and neatly trimmed shrubbery distinguishes the Albertson's house. More thanforty bicycles flood the driveway.

Ext. Back Yard 

The biggest game of red-rover you've ever seen. Every kid in the neighborhood has joined in.Fifty kids ranging in age from 8 to 14 form a straight line, join hands and face off against thecompetition. Down to our four twelve year old girls who stand holding hands. They are alldressed similarly in rolled up cut off

Page 11

shorts, various colored shirts tied up at the waist and flip flop sandals.

Samantha, the tallest of the group is lanky, has long, straight hair and wears glasses. Chrissyis a little chubby and a lot pristine. Her hair is in pig-tails and she only wears pink. Roberta isa tomboy who'd almost always rather be playing softball. Tina is the smallest of the four, henceher nickname, Teeny. They huddle and decide who to call over.

Samantha
How about Billy Wayne?

Roberta
The book worm?

Samantha
I think he's cute.

Roberta
What about Bobby Fricker?

Chrissy
Gross. He's always picking his nose... and eating his boogers.

Roberta
So what, he's a wimp.

Teeny
I say we call over Brett Jones.

The girls all look over at -- Brent Jones -- a hunk of a guy who's a year ahead of them in school.

Teeny
This could be my last chance to talk to him all summer.

Samantha
He could break through without even trying.

Teeny (hopeful)
And land right on top of me.

Chrissy
Can you get your mind off boys for maybe a minute?

Teeny
Gee I don't know. I've never tired.

Page 12

Roberta
Knock it off you guys. Who's it gonna be?

Samantha takes charge and looks over their opponents.

Samantha
Bobby Fricker.

They form a straight line and lock hands. Samantha announces the decision. 

Samantha 
Red rover, red rover send Bobby Fricker right over.

The opposing team moans and groans. Bobby Fricker - a little geek - pulls his finger out of hisnose. He takes a deep breath and charges toward the girls as his teammates cheer him on.

The girl's eyes widen as Bobby picks up speed.

Roberta
Booger alert!

Slam! Bobby plows between Samantha and Teeny. They grip-lock hands. Bobby pushes forwardbut doesn't break the chain. He falls back on his ass and all four girls stand united.

Ext. Gaslight Addition - Night

A near full moon shines bright. The gas lamp posts in the neighborhood flame.

Int. Samantha's Bedroom - Night

Lit by moonlight. Numerous bookshelves are filled with fiction and non-fiction all pertaining toghost, witches, vampires and various other supernatural goblings. A poster of Barnabus Collins,from "Dark Shadows" fame, hangs over the bed.

Samantha reads "The Fall of the House of Usher" under the beam of a flashlight. We hearher parents talking. A door slams! Engrossed in her book Samantha's not phased.

Mrs. Albertson (O.S.)
Ted please.

The quarrel escalates, as does the volume of their voices.

Page 13

Mr. Albertson (O.S.)
Please what?

Mrs. Albertson (O.S.)
Everybody has problems. Can't we try and work this out?

Another door slams. Their argument continues, behind closed doors. Samantha looks up from herbook. Angela, her four year old sister, stands at the foot of Samantha's bed. Puppy dog eyes.

Samantha
Okay.

Angela smiles, climbs into the bed and snuggles next to her sister. Samantha turns the page ofher book and reads on.

Samantha (V.O.)
My parents had been fighting for as long as I could remember. It never bothered me. It was theopposite actually. There's comfort in consistency.

Ext. Gaslight Addition - Morning

Fathers leave for work. Mothers wave goodbye.

Int. Roberta's bedroom - Morning

Roberta, alone in her room, rips a piece of masking tape from the roll and sticks it to her dresser.

Close On: Ten long pieces of masking tape affixed to the dresser. Next to them, a small, blackand white photo propped up against the mirror. The woman in the picture is incredibly beautiful.

Roberta, wearing her bra and panties, stands sideways in front of her mirror. She assesses herbreast size with a measuring tape, marks the spot with her finger and looks at her progress.Frustration.

Roberta (discouraged)
No matter what I do, they just keep getting bigger.

Roberta flattens her boobs and wraps a piece of masking tape around her chest. Then another, as she continues what has become her morning routine. A knock on the door.

Page 14

Mr. Martin (O.S.)
Better hurry up. Your breakfast's getting cold.

Roberta hurries to get dressed. She pulls a baggy shirt from underneath the big golden retrieverthat sits on her bed.

Samanth (V.O.)
Roberta grew up with her dad and 3 older brothers. Her mother died when she was four. That'sher in the picture.

Roberta grabs the photo from her dresser and gently slides it in her back pocket.

Samantha (V.O.)
Roberta never left the house without that picture.

Roberta opens her bedroom door just as two of her brothers shove her third brother across thehallway. He slams into Roberta, who unfazed, shoves him back toward the others. She continuesdown the hall, without concern, as the boys beat the hell out of each other.

Int. Teeny's Bedroom - Morning

The walls are covered with movie star posters. A blend of current "Tiger Beat" studs - DavidCassidy and Bobby Sherman mixed in with the greats - Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.

Teeny (O.S.)
Tina, tell us how it felt at the exact moment when you realized you had won.

Teeny, modeling heavy make-up, her mother's most glamorous dress and a huge pair of fakebreasts, stands in front of the mirror and interviews herself.

Teeny
Well Rona, I can only say I've thought about this day....dreamed about this day, for as long as Ican remember,

Her siamese cat lies on the window ledge and curiously watches his master.

Teeny
To win an Academy Award at such a young age is an enormous accomplishment.

Page 15

Teeny (cont.)
Where will you go from here? 
Well, first off Rona, thank you. As for what will come next, I'd like to direct.

Samantha (V.O.)
Teeny was an only child. Her parents were country clubbers. Never around, really. A typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars.

Int. Chrissy's Bedroom - Morning

Pink, for as far as the eye can see. A canopy bed with a matching dresser and vanity, which iswhere we find Chrissy, brushing her curly blond locks.

Chrissy
Ninety two (another stroke) 
Ninety three.

Chrissy's Mother (O.S.)
Chrissy?

The bedroom door opens and Mrs. Dewitt enters. Chrissy is a miniature version of her mom, downto their matching pink outfits. She inspects her daughter's room. Spotless. Wrong. She walks acrossthe room and straightens a small crinkle in the bed spread.

Chrissy (still brushing)
Ninety eight, ninety nine, one hundred.

Mrs. Dewitt sits next to Chrissy. Parts her daughter's hair and braids the tighest pig tails in moviehistory.

Mrs. Dewitt
Chrissy, I've been thinking about what you asked me?

Chrissy
About sex?

Mrs. Dewitt tenses and pulls the pig tails even tighter.

Mrs. Dewitt
You say that word so casually. It scares me.

Page 16

Chrissy
I'm sorry mommy.

Mrs. Dewitt
I think you're much too young to be informed. But, since your friends are trash mouths, I'd ratheryou hear the facts from me.

Mrs Dewitt ponders how to break the news of the "dirty deed" to her daughter.

Mrs. Dewitt
This may come as a shock to you ...

Chrissy stares up at her mommy, waiting to hear the facts of life.

Samantha (V.O)
As a direct results of this conversation, Chrissy will spend a significant part of her adult lifewondering if she's ever has an orgasm.

Ext. Gaslight Addition - Late Morning

Samantha, Teeny and Roberta wait for Chrissy. They sit on the street curb in front of her house.To kill time, Roberta throws rocks at a nearby aluminum trash can. Samantha reads her Poepaperback and Teeny plucks the petals off of a wild flower.

Teeny (while plucking)
He loves me not. He loves me...(distraught) He loves me not.

She tosses the bare stem on the grounmd, next to ten other stems and a pile of petals. 
Samanthaturns the page of her book and glances up for a second, noticing Teeny's large roundbreasts of the day.

Samantha
What are you using today?

Teeny reaches into her shirt and pulls out --

Teeny
Nerf balls. I think they work well.

She stuffs it back in and sticks out her chest.

Teeny
Don't you?

Page 17

Samantha really gives her chest a serious look.

Samantha
It's a natural look. Texture wise I mean.

Roberta dispassionately looks at Teeny's chest.

Roberta
They're too round.

The older mail man. Mr. Winchester, heads up the sidewalk, toward the girls.

Teeny
Hey Mister Winchester, did my package come yet?

He reaches into his bag.

Mr. Winchester
Is this what you've been waiting for?

He hands her a package and she reads the label. As she rips open the box:

Teeny (excited)
It's from the David Cassidy fan club.

She pulls out a Love Bead Necklace.

Teeny
Isn't it cool?

Mr. Winchester
Very cool.

He moves on. Teeny puts on the neckless and models it for Samantha and Roberta.

Teeny
Well?

Samantha
It looks just like the one he wears on the Partridge Family.

Four rambunctious boys, ranging from eight to thirteen years old, tear down the street on theirbicycles.

Samantha (V.O.)

Those are the Wormers. Everyone in the neighborhood felt sorry for their mother.

Page 18

Samantha (cont.)
Like us, the Wormers' also has a summer goal. It was to make our lives miserable. They were theenemy.

Teeny spots the tough guys first.

Teeny
Here comes trouble.

Samantha
Just ignore 'em

Chrissy walks out of her house and approaches her friends.

Teeny
It's about time.

Roberta stands

Roberta (taunting)
Hey, wormy Wormers.

Just then, the Wormers weave across the road and head straight for the girls. The oldest, Scott,leads the pack.

Scott
Now.

Simulyaneously, Scott and his three yound=ger brothers, Roger, Clay and Eric, pull jello-filledballoons from under their jackets.

Roberta
Air raid!

The girls try to run, but it's too late.

Roger
Bombs away.

Chrissy screams as Splat! The girls are drenched in lime jello. The Wormers ride on. Roberta runsafter them. She dives for Scott's bike but misses, landing face first on the pavement. She quicklygets up and ignores her scuffed knees.

Roberta
We owe you Wormers. And we always pay our debts.

Scott looks back over his shoulder.

Scott
Like we're really afraid of a bunch of girls.

Page 19

Roberta
You should be!

She flips them the bird as the Wormers ride out of sight.

Ext. Shelby - Day

It's small town America at it most charming. The town square is lined with mom and pop shops,owned by generations of the same families. In the center of the town square stands the oldbrick county courthouse. On the courthouse lawn, bronze statues remember local war heros fromthe "Heart of America".

And as always, the local soda shop is bustling with activity.

Int. Soda Shop 

This corner drug store and soda fountain is the hang out. "Piece of my Heart" by Janis Joplinplays on the juke box.

Samantha, Teeny, Chrissy and Roberta sit at their regular table, a big red vinyl booth, scootedup next to the front pane-glass window. As usual, they're dressed in their summer uniform ofcut-offs and tied up shirts. Chrissy counts a pile of change and dollar bills as Teeny conducts thelatest "Cosmo" magazine quiz and keeps score.

Teeny
Your idea of foreplay is "A" a candle lit dinner and moonlit walk on the beach? "B" making out ona bearskin rug at a local mountain cabin? "C" watching a sexy movie and or "D" all of the above.

Teeny jots down their answers as they speak up:

Samantha
B

Roberta
E... none of the above.

Teeny
That's not a possible answer.

Roberta (sighs)
Then B....I guess. 

Page 20

Chrissy (while counting)
Definitely A.

Teeny
Surprise Surprise.

Chrissy
What's that supposed to mean, bug brain?

Teeny
Nothing...
(pondering her insult)
...larva lips.

Roberta
Larva lips...I like that. Not bad at all....for a mucus mouth.

Samantha
You're all ... feces faces.

The girls groan. Samantha wins an unspoken victory of grossness.

Teeny
I pick D...all of the above.

Chrissy
Surprise Surprise.

Teeny notices a group of four teenage girls at the counter. They're all wearing tube tops and looking very adult.

Teeny (envious)
Maybe we should incorporate tube tops into our summer look.

Roberta
Forget it.

Teeny quietly relents and tallies up their "Cosmo" score.

Chrissy
That's eighty two dollars and twenty four cents.

She pours the money back into a coffee can.

Samantha
So how much more do we need?

As she flattens a piece of paper out on the table.

Page 21

Chrissy
Twenty three more dollars and the tree house is ours.

Close on: Paper - A page torn out of the Sears catalogue. An ad for a put-it-together-yourselftree house.

Back to scene

Teeny
I say the first night we get it, we have a slumber party.

Samantha 
Definitely.

Roberta
My dad said he'll pay us fifteen bucks if we paint his new garage door.

Samantha
Great. We can handle it after the carnival.

Chrissy
We'll raise at least fifteen dollars there.

Samantha
And the garage door should put us over the top. We'll definitely get the tree house before theFourth of July.

Roberta glances out the window and nudges Samantha.

Roberta (impressed)
Get a load of your mom.

Everyone looks.

Chrissy (shocked)
How short are those shorts?

Teeny (with envy)
How tall are those boots?

Cue Up: Nancy Sinatra's "Boots" as -- Girl Pov. - Samantha's mother struts down the sidewalk,wearing red hot pants and white go-go boots.

Samantha (V.O.)
I had no idea why, but earlier that summer, my mom began to dress like Nancy Sinatra.

Page 22

Back to Scene

Teeny
Your mom is so cool.

Samantha, embarrassed, changes the subject.

Samantha
You guys it's a full moon tonight. A festival of the spirits who return to earth and walk amongthe living.

Just then, their spooky looking waitress, Wiladine, brings their order, Wearing all black, she's aneccentric kook, with a far away look in her eyes. She sets down four mugs, each  filled with a scoopof vanilla ice cream, and four small bottles of Coca Cola in front of the girls.

Wiladine
Four black cows. That's a dollar five, boys.

They dig into their pockets and hand over the change.

Chrissy
We're girls.

Wiladine
I know.

The girls pour their Coca Colas over their ice cream and dig in.

Outside the Window: Unbeknownst to the girls, Samanth's mom enters an Attorney's office.

Wiladine winks at Chrissy and walks away.

Chrissy
She is so off.

Teeny
What do you expect? She's a witch.

The girls don't believe a word Teeny says.

Teeny
I swear. She's got voo doo dolls and everything. I saw'em.

Samantha
Where?

Teeny
At her house. And hear this. One of the dolls looked just like Principal

Page 23

Winters. And do you know what? There was a needle sticking right in the middle of his heart.I saw it the morning before he had his heart attack.

Wiladine returns with their change. They can't help but look at her like she's from Mars. Shegives them a creepy look right back.

Samantha
So, do we try another seance tonight?

Chrissy
It didn't work last time and it won't work this time.

Samantha
I'm telling you. This is the one night when the barrier between the dead and the living can bebroken. I read it in the Encyclopedia of Supernatural Phenomena. It'll work. I promise.

Teeny
You actually read the Encylopedia of Supernatual Phenomena?

Samantha
Cover to cover.

Chrissy
You are so weird.

Teeny
I'm in.

Roberta
Me too.

Chrissy
If I get caught I'm going to be grounded for the rest of the summer.

Samantha
You're not going to get caught. I say we meet in the cemetery at eleven and don't worry. I'llbring a cross to protect us from the evil demons who lurk about in the graveyard.

Page 24

Teeny
Okay, here are the scores. (reading from "Cosmo")
Roberta, you're a women on the verge. Although your sensuality is yet to be tapped, it is likea volcano ready to erupt... Whoa, look out for Roberta.

Roberta
That's crap.

Teeny (reading)
Samantha, you look before you leap and walk the fine line between romanticism and sex appeal.Don't be afraid to take the plunge. You might surprise yourself.

Samantha
I'll keep that in mind.

Teeny (reading)
Chrissy, Let go of your inhibitions before you dry up like a prune.

Chrissy
What's that suppose to mean?

The others exchange a look and share a laugh at Chrissy's expense.

Teeny
Now me. (reading)
Teeny, you are a sexual magnet attracting men from the four corners of the world. Pace yourself.

She lowers the magazine, revealing a shit eating grin on her face.

Ext. Gaslight Addition - Night

The Gaslight Addition sleeps. A deep-orange, full moon hangs low in the sky. An orchestra ofcrickets is all we hear.

Int. Samantha's bedroom - Night

Samantha lies in bed and reads by the light of her flashlight. Again, we hear her parents arguingbehind closed doors. Samantha turns the page of her book. We hear a door swing open. Footsteps

Page 25

in the hall.

Mr Albertson (O.S.)
I'll get the rest when the girls are out of the house.

Samantha looks up from her book. Listens.

Mrs. Albertson (O.S.)
Maybe we should see a counselor.

Mr. Albertson (O.S.)
Don't you listen? We're past that point. This just isn't working for me.

Muffled talking as they move away from Samanth's bedroom door. Samantha jumps out of bedand tries to listen at the door, but can't make out what they're saying. We realize she's fully dressedto sneak out. We hear a car door slam and an engine crank. Samantha moves to the windowand parts the curtains.

Samanth's POV - Mr Albertson, middle American nice guy, backs his middle class car out of thedrive way.

Back to scene

Samantha waves to him, but he obviously doesn't see her. Stunned and clearly disturbed,Samantha watches until he drives out of sight. We hear maternal footsteps approach. Notwanting to deal with her mother, Samantha dives into bed and pulls on the covers.

Mrs. Albertson stands in the doorway. With a worried mother's look on her face, she studies hersleeping daughter. Finally, she leaves and closes the door.

Samantha opens her eyes. She looks at the clock on her nightstand, which reads -- 10:50. AsSamantha climbs out of bed, slides open her bedroom window and very quietly sneaks out:

Samantha (V.O.)
I decided not to tell the others about my father. Call me a fool, but I actually thought he'd beback. A wishful notion I held onto for years. At the time no one in the Gaslight Addition hasgotten a divorce and the last thing I wanted was to be different from my friends.

Page 26

Ext. Cemetery - Night

The full moon hangs over this dark and eerie final resting place.

Crypts are sealed with overgrown vines. Headstones, some chiseled in the 1800's are worn andweathered. Scattered leaves dance in the wind and massive oak trees seem to have faces in thelight and could come to life at any moment.

Samantha, Roberta, Chrissy and Teeny sit on a blanket, in the middle of a fenced-off, familyplot. Arranged in a cirlce, they take this seance business very seriously. Samantha places threewhite candles in the center of the circle and lights them, one by one. The candle flame andcast a flickering glow on the girl's faces.

Chrissy
I'm cold.

Roberta removes her sweatshirt and tosses it to Chrissy.

Roberta
Now I'll be cold, but maybe you'll shut up.

Chrissy slips it on. It fits snugly. She looks chubbier than usual and she knows it.

Chrissy
It makes me look fat.

Teeny (matter of fact)
You are fat.

Chrissy
I'm not fat. Am I fat?

Samantha
Okay people. Lay your hands flat on the blanket and touch your pinkies and thumbs to theperson's sitting next to you.

They comply and spread their hands out on the blanket, forming a complete circle.

Teeny
Let's contact Marilyn Monroe.

Roberta
She didn't cooperate last time.

Chrissy
No one cooperates.

Page 27

Samantha
I think we should bring back someone buried in the cemetery. (as she looks around the area) Howabout Dear Johnny?

Close on: A nearby tombstone. The inscription reads: Rest in Peace Dear Johnny. Born 1933 - Died1945.

Samantha let's find out how he died.

Teeny
Maybe he was skinned alive by some weirdo psycho killer? If we bring him back we'll have to lookat his skinless body.

Chrissy
That's disgusting.

Roberta
No, this is disgusting.

She turns away from the group. Her face hidden. When she turns back towards them, her eyelidsare flipped inside out. Although they've seen this a hundred times, the gag still repulses herfriends. They groan.

Samantha (to Roberta)
Are you through now?

Roberta
Yeah,

She pops her eyelips back into place.

Samantha
Is everyone ready? (as they join hands)
Alright, everyone close your eyes. (as they comply)
Bless us in our pursuit of the spirit world. Keep our circle safe from those who promoteevil and seek to harm.

A moment of silence.

Samantha
Dear Johnny, we know you were just a kid when you died and we want to find out why.

Page 28

Teeny
I'm heeeeeere.

Roberta elbows her.

Teeny
Ouch.

Samantha 
Concentrate.

A strong wind blows and dead leave tumble across the cemetery. Lightning flickers in the distanceas a summer storm heads their way.

Samantha
Can you hear us Johnny? If you can hear me, let us know. Give us a sign, It's okay. We just wantto talk to you. Tell us how you died.

Distant Thunder as the storm blows nearer.

Chrissy (scared)
He's here.

Teeny, Roberta and Samantha open their eyes and look at Chrissy. She's not the type to put theseguys on. Chrissy's eyes remain tightly shut. She rocks back and forth, rhythmically.

Chrissy
He wants to tell us his story.

Samantha
Chrissy?

Roberta breaks the circle.

Roberta
Let's stop.

Samantha grabs Roberta's hand back.

Chrissy
He's afraid.

Samantha
Tell him not to be scared.  It's okay.

Chrissy
He's all by himself. He's lonely. He needs a friend.

Page 29

Chrissy cries as the sky thunders. Roberta and Teeny simultaneously break the circle, scared.

Roberta
Holy shit.

Chrissy's cries turn into the giggles.

Chrissy
Gotcha.

Roberta, pissed, punches Chrissy in the arm.

Chrissy
Hey, that hurt.

Roberta
You deserve it, fart ass.

Samantha
Don't ever do that again.

Chissy
I'm sorry, but you guys are so gullible when it comes to the this stuff. I mean, it's all justpretend. Right?

Crack! A deafening explosion electrifies the sky as a bolt of lightning hits, a nearby tree. Thegirls scream.

Roberta
Let's get outta here!

They all take off except for --

Samantha
I'm right behind you.

Rain sprinkles down as Samantha gathers the candles and tosses them into a back pack. An eeriesong plays and suddenly very cold, Samantha shivers. She feels someone's presence and startled,turns around quickly. A bolt of lightning flashes and illuminates a scary shadow. Spooked, Samanthaquickly hurries after her friends.

Samantha
Hey, wait up.

When she reaches them:

Samantha (out of breath)
There's someone out there.

They all turn back and look.

Page 30

Samantha (pointing)
Over there.

Another bolt of lightning illuminates the grounds but the shadow is gone.

Chrissy
I don't see anyone.

Samantha's eyes search the spot and she no longer sees anyone either.

Chrissy
What are we waiting for?

Teeny
It was probably just the wind or something.

Samantha reluctantly relents. 

Samantha
Yeah, maybe.

Ext. Cemetery Road - Moments Later

The rain subsides and the gang walks home. Chrissy takes great care in avoiding every waterpuddle in her path. Roberta intentionally jumps into every water puddle in her path.

Chrissy
Roberta, why can't you act like a girl?

Roberta
You got me.

Roberta defiantly jumps into another puddle, sending a few spots of mud splashing onto Chrissy'sshirt. Chrissy gasps.

Chrissy
Now, look what you've done.

Roberta
What?

Chrissy frantically attempts to scratch off the spot.

Chrissy
You know how much I hate to get dirty.

Roberta looks at the minimal damage.

Page 31

Roberta
Ah, that's nothin'.

As they turn the corner everyone stops, frozen in their tracks. We hear a high pitched, rhythmicsqueak...squeak.

Samantha (whipsers)
It's Crazy Pete.

The girls forget to breathe when they finally see --

Crazy Pete, a very scary looking old man who rides a battered bicycle down the street. Hisface drawn and remarkably thin. He looks like a human skeleton. Crazy Pete doesn'tnotice the girls and that's just how they want to keep it. After he turns the corner and ridesthe squeaking bicycle out of sight --

The girls breathe a sigh of reief. We realize they're genuinely afraid of this man.

Samantha
Let's cut through the field.

Ext. Field - Moments later

Lit by the blue glow of a bright full moon, the girls walk through a field of waist highgrass.

Roberta
Why do you think Crazy Pete only comes out at night?

Chrissy (a simple explanation)
Because he's crazy.

Samantha
Maybe he's a vampire.

The girls all look to Samantha.

Samantha (with eloquence)
He lives in a world of darkness because the sunlight could burn a hole right through to hisimmortal soul. The blood that runs through his veins is the blood of all the children he'ssucked the life out of. Young blood is what he's looking for. It keeps him eternal.

The girls exchange a frightened look. Teeny considers it:

Page 32

Teeny
That's a logical explanation.

They all pick up the pace and walk out of the field, finding themselves on the back sideof the --

Ext. Gaslight Addition 

Before they go their seperate ways:

Chrissy 
Will someone walk me home?

Samantha
You're only five houses down.

Chrissy
But I'm scared of Crazy Pete.

Teeny
He's probably half way across town by now.

Chrissy knows Roberta's her last chance. She looks at her with pleading eyes.

Chrissy
Pleeeeeese.

Roberta
Alright.

Teeny
See you guys tomorrow.

Samantha
Early, so we can get ready for the carnival.

They split up. Roberta walks with Chrissy. Samantha heads to her house and Teeny walksalone towards hers.

Ext. Chrissy's house - Noon

A colorful bouquet of ballons are tied to the gas lamp post, in the front yard.

Ext. Back Yard 

Page 33

More ballons, Chrissy charges the neighborhood kids a nickel each as they walk through theside gate. Roberta mans the lemonade stand for another nickel a pop.

Cue Up: "Come And Get Your Love" by Redbone as we pan over to where most of the actionis -- Teeny charges a quarter a pop in the kissing booth. Her boobs are exceptionally hugetoday. A long line of boys wait their turn as the first boy in line hands Teeny a quarter. Shedrops the money into a jar, grabs the boy by the collar and plants a kiss on him. He walksaway with a big grin on his face.

Teeny looks down and notices her right boob-of-the-day has slipped down to her waist. She quicklyturns aways from the line and pulls it back into place. She turns back to the boys and --

Teeny
Next.

Another boy hands Teeny a quarter and gets his money's worth when she delivers a lingering kiss.Several boys in line, including Brett Jones (the cute boy from red rover) start to get antsy asthey wait their turn.

Another angle - With a king size sheet draped over it, the swing set has become a gypsy fortuneteller's tent. The sign outside reads: Fortunes told 25 cents.

Int. Tent

Samantha, towel wrapped around her head like a turban, sits at a small table. Morton, a nerdy kid,sits across from her and hands over a quarter. They stare into a crystal ball as Samantha caressesit lightly.

Samantha
Morton, I see a girl in your future.

Morton
Who is it?

Samantha
I probably shouldn't say. Why tempt fate?

Morton
Come on Samantha. Who is it?

Samantha
Well, if you insist. It's Chrissy.

Morton
Chrissy Dewitt? Really ?

Page 34

Ahhhhhhhhh! A horrifying scream emanates from outside the tent. Morton jumps up
and knocksover the table.

Ext. Backyard

Samantha pops out of the tent and surveys the scene as kids run for cover as the automaticsprinkler system sprays water across the yard. Chrissy is shoved aside as kids run past her.

Teeny, now kissing Brett Jones, is drenched by the water but doesn't break away from him.

Roberta spots the Wormers, huddled next to the sprinkler switch, appreciating the laugh. Scottwaves to her.

Scott
Hi Roberta.

Roberta
You're dead, Wormer!

She takes off toward him, but slips and falls.

Scott
Ouch.

Teeny, still entranced in her lip lock with Brett, doesn't bother to come up for air.

Int. Samantha's Kitchen - Evening

Dinner time. Samantha eats meat loaf with her mother and sister. She glances at her father'sempty chair. Angela catches the look.

Angela
Where's my daddy?

Mrs. Albertson
I told you honey, he had to go away for a little while, but you can visit him soon.

Samantha (sarcastic)
Every other weekend and holidays?

Mrs. Albertson gives Samantha a look.

Angela
But I want to see him now.

Mrs. Albertson
I wish you could honey, but you can't.

Page 35

She stands and clears the table. Angela, too youg to remotely understand the situation, lookssad. Samantha attempts to cheer her.

Samantha (to Angela)
Hey, Angela I saw Crazy Pete yesterday.

A frightened and curious look comes over Angela's face.

Mrs. Albertson
You kids leave that lonely old man alone. Do you hear me?

Samantha looks at her mother, who wears another hot pants outfit.

Samantha
Why are you dressed like that, anyway?

Mrs. Albertson
Like what?

Samantha
Like ......that. It's embarrassing.

Mrs. Albertson looks down at her outfit as Samantha gets up from the table and stomps out ofthe room. We hear her bedroom door slam.

Int. Samantha's Bedroom - Late Night

Tick tock tick tock tick tock. The wind up, alarm clock reads 12 o'clock. Midnight. Samantha stirs,enduring a restless sleep.

The familiar eerie music plays in the distance. It grows louder, nearer. Builds to a crescendo as thebedroom curtains billow and a gust of wind burts into the room. Her telescope swivels.

Samantha shivers in her sleep as the room suddenly gets cold.

Her gerbil's go crazy in their habitrail. They run around like mad, screeching and squealing.

Samantha stirs then opens her eyes to find -- Spooky Shadows dancing on the wall. A giant shadowresembling a ghostly silhouette moves across the room toward Samantha. It seems to hoverover her.

Samantha pulls the covers up to her face, leaving only her frightened eyes to peek out. Finally,the music fades aways as the wind dies down and the curtains fall still.

Samantha cautiously climbs out of bed and walks to the window. She

Page 36

reaches up and yanks on a string affixed to the window sill.

Ext. Samanth's house

We follow the string up to a tree, across to a light pole then down to a house.

Ext. Roberta's bedroom

Ding, Ding. Roberta wakes at the sound of the bell. She groggily climbs out of bed. She opensher bedroom window and tugs on the string, signaling she got the message.

Int. Teeny's bedroom - Moments later

Teeny lies asleep in her bed. A circle of light shines on her face. It turns off and on. It'scoming in through the window. She immediately grabs a flashligh from under her bedand hurries to her bedroom window.

Int. Roberta's bedroom

Roberta shines her flashlight into Teeny's room. Across her backyard we see the beam ofTeeny's flashlight returning the signal.

Int. Teeny's bedroom

Teeny grabs a walking talkie from her nightstand and talks into it.

Teeny
Base to Chrissy. Base to Chrissy.

Int. Chrissy's bedroom

Chrissy stirs in her sleep as she hears the walkie talkie on her nightstand blare:

Page 37

Teeny (over walkie talkie)
Base to Chrissy, Do you copy? Over?

Chrissy grabs her receiver.

Chrissy (into the walkie talkie)
What?

Teeny
We need a secret meeting

Chrissy
Now?

Ext. Drive In - Moments later

The secret meeting place. Behind the Gaslight Addition. We find the Skyline Drive-in. Prime. Youdon't see these anymore. It's two in the morning and the place is abandoned for the night.

The girls, in their pajamas and robes are silhouetted against the giant white screen as theywalk back and forth on the wooden plank at its base.

Samantha
Remember, I thought I saw someone in the cemetery the night of the seance?

Teeny
Yeah.

Samantha
Well, I wasn't sure until tonight, when it came into my bedroom.

Teeny
Who?

Samantha
Dear Johnny.

Chrissy
Give me a break.

Samantha (hooking them)
It wasn't like he was a person, but I felt his presense. He came in through the window andinstantly filled the room. He was everywhere all at once.

Page 38

A chill runs up her spine.

Samantha
I could feel his icy breath on my neck.

They all look at her, being reeled in by her persuasive tone.

Teeny
It's him. It has to be.

Chrissy
Oh, come on you guys, this is ridiculous.

Roberta
Why?

Chrissy
Because, the seances were just for fun. None of us actually believed we could bring someoneback from the dead.

Teeny
I did.

Chrissy
Why am I not surprised? You think Marilyn Monroe's your guardian angel.

Teeny
She is, so shut up bacteria breath.

Chrissy
You shut up, butt brain.

Roberta
I believed too.

Chrissy (convincing herself)
It was lightning. Or the wind or something.

Roberta
They why did you haul ass out of the cemetery like you'd seen a ghost.

Samantha
We have to go back there.

Chrissy (hopeful)
Tomorrow right?

Page 39

Ext. Cemetery - Later that night

Wrong. Samantha shines the way with her flashlight as the girls walk through the cemetery.It's late. It's scary.

Chrissy (worried)
We shouldn't be out here this late. I mean, what do you expect to find?

Samantha
I think Dear Johnny might feel more comfortable hanging out here with the dead.

Chrissy (more worried)
I really don't think this is a good idea.

A hoot owl bellows and the girls slow their pace, continually look around, as if they expectthe Boogie Man to jump out from behind a tombstone at any minute.

Chrissy
This is definitely a bad idea.

Everyone's nervous and Chrissy is making it worse.

Roberta
Shut up Chrissy. You're bugging the shit out of me right now.

Teeny
Ditto

Samantha (scared but excited)
We're almost there.

They move onward until Samantha trips over something lying on the ground. She lands flat onher face, in the dark.

Samantha
What the --

Teeny picks up the flashlight and shines it down on Samantha, who's face is right next to --Dear Johnny's tombstone which is laying flat on the ground, cracked down the middle.

Samantha, startled by the sight, quickly climbs to her feet and they all stare down at DearJohnny's grave.

Roberta
Son of a bitch.

Page 40

Teeny
We did it. We actually friggin' did it.

Samantha
He's back... and we brought him here.

We hear an enormous whoosh as the hoot owl swoops down over their heads. Chrissy screamsand on her cue they all take off running.

Int. Roberta's Bedroom - Later

Roberta pulls a rosary out of her dresser and hangs it on the bed post before calling it a night.

Int. Teeny's Bedroom 

Teeny lays in bed and looks, nervously, around her room. Her closet door is open and herclothes look like people, lurking in the dark. Teeny hops out of bed and slams the closetdoor shut.

Int. Chrissy's Bedroom

Chrissy turns off the light and slips into bed. A moment later, she turns the light backon, crawls out of bed and onto the floor. She cautiously lifts her comforter and peeksunder the bed. All clear. Chrissy climbs back into bed but this time, she leaves thelight on. For someone who doesn't believe in ghosts, she's sure got the spooks.

Int. Samantha Bedroom

Samantha lays in bed and watches the silhouetted shadows dancing on her wall. She pullsthe covers up over her head.

Ext. Shelby Library - Late Morning

Teeny, Roberta and Chrissy sit on the library steps, eating orange push ups. Samantha existsthe library.

Samantha
There's nothing on Dear Johnny.

As Teeny hands Samantha her push up:

Samantha
Everything before nineteen forty eight was lost in a fire, but Miss Wendy said the Greenfield library keeps copies of all the county papers.

Chrissy
Well, that settles that.

Samantha
What settles what?

Chrissy
We can't ride our bikes all the way to Greenfield (dreading the response)
Can we?

Country Road - Late Morning

A deserted, country lane, lined with large maple trees on both sides. The girls ride their bikes down the center of the road and pass a sign - Greenfield 9 miles. As they cruise along, Teeny belts out with a unique Diana Ross flair, her rendition of "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."

Teeny
And if you should miss my lovin' One of those old days. If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close. Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly. Just remember what I told you the day I set you free.

Samantha
Bring it home, sister.

Teeny (giving it her all)
Ain't no mountain high enough. Ow! Ain't no valley low enough. Ow! No river wide enough. Nothin' can keep me. Keep me from yoooou....

The ride over a hill and out of sight. Teeny's crooning voice drifting off into the horizon.

Ext. Pond Road - Later

The girls ride past a clear country pond.

Page 42

Ext. Uncle Beans Corner Store - Noon

A general store five miles from anywhere. Four bikes are parked in front. A nearby road sign: Greenfield 5 miles. Samantha dumps change into a soda machine and grabs four bottle of pop.

Lunchtime. Chrissy, Teeny and Roberta sit at a picnic table and unpack a knapsack. Sandwiches, candy bars and chips. Chrissy chows down.

Teeny
Truth or dare Roberta?

Samantha approaches and hands out the sodas.

Roberta
Truth.

Teeny
How big are your boobs now?

Roberta
Drop Dead.

Samantha gives Chrissy the change and she quickly counts it then deposits it back into the "tree house money" coffee can. Everyone eats.

Teeny
She has to say, doesn't she Sam?

Samantha exchanges glances with Roberta, who is embarrassed, looks down at the table. It's apparent the boob thing is a real issue with her.

Samantha
She doesn't have to say if she doesn't want to.

Teeny
Well, then... can we see 'em?

Roberta
No, you can't see them.

Chrissy
Weirdo.

Page 43

Teeny (confessing)
I don't have any real one's yet.

Roberta
You'll get them and you'll hate them.

Teeny
You're lucky Roberta. Men love 'em when they're big.

Teeny sticks her chest out, modeling today's falsie job.

Teeny
Look how big mine are today.

They all survey her breasts.

Samantha (impressed)
They almost look real.

Teeny proudly reaches into her shirt and pulls out a balloon.

Teeny
It's filled with pudding?

Samantha
Pudding?

Teeny
The Wormers actually gave me the idea, but jello was too jiggly. Pudding has a heavier more realistic texture.

She hands the balloon to Samantha who holds it in her hand testing its weight.

Samantha
I think you may have finally got it.

She hands the balloon back and Teeny stuffs it back into her brazier.

Chrissy
What flavor is it?

Teeny
Vanilla

Chrissy nods, thinking it's a good flavor choice.

Teeny
Chrissy, truth or dare?

Page 44

Chrissy
I don't want to play.

Roberta
Truth or dare?

Chrissy (reluctantly yielding)
Truth.

Teeny
Have you ever been french kissed?

Chrissy
Are you kidding? I don't want to get pregnant.

Roberta
You can't get pregnant from kissing.

Chrissy
I know that beetle brain. But, it's common knowledge, if you tongue kiss a boy, he automatically thinks you'll do the deed with him. It's the male curse.

Roberta
The deed?

Samantha (egging her on)
What deed would that be?


Chrissy
You know. Planting the seed and watering the flower.

Teeny
What flower?

Chrissy
The flower a woman grows when she's about to make a baby with her husband.

They give her a confused look.

Chrissy
Isn't that how it works? The man uses his watering can and sprinkles it on the flower?

Laughter from the others.

Page 45

Chrissy
Well, if that's not what happens then how does it work?

Roberta leans over and whispers to Chrissy. As she listens intently her eyes go wide and a horrified look comes across Chrissy's face.

Chrissy (disbelief and shock)
He sticks it in?

Ext. Country Road - Afternoon

The girls continue their journey as they listen to a Transistor radio tied to Teeny's handlebars.Tony Orlando and Dawn's Knock Three Times" plays.

All
Oh my darlin' Knock Three Times on the ceiling if you want me. Twice on the pipe-- (Chrissy dings her bike bell twice) -- if the answer is noooo.  

In the distance, a squawking sound grows louder. Samantha stops her bike.

Samantha
Listen. (as everyone brakes) Turn that off.

Teeny switches off the radio and we are overwhelmed by the sound of a thousand screaming birds.

Roberta
Where are they?

Samantha
In there.

Across the road, a wheat field stretches for as far as the eye can see. The stalks are waist high.No birds are visible but the sound is incredibly loud.

Teeny
There must be a thousand of them.

She climbs off her bike, picks up a stick and tosses it into --

Samantha
Don't.

Page 46

Too late. The stick goes flying. As it lands in the wheat field, a hundred blackbirds flap their wings and take flight.

The sky becomes a moving black cloud.

The girls watch in amazement until -- plop. Bird poop lands on Teeny's bicycle seat and Roberta laughs. Plop Plop Plop. It's everywhere and suddenly not so funny.

Samantha
Let's get out of here!

Teeny jumps on her bike and they all tear down the road, away from the moving black cloud. The squawking's almost unbearable as it rains bird shit. Chrissy freaks out. When she realises she'sbeen hit, she bursts into tears.

Chrissy
Grooooooss!

She loses it as they all ride toward an old barn.

Int. Barn

They enter the barn and wait for the flock to pass over them. Chrissy, completely repulsed, 
sobs hysterically.

Roberta
Chrissy it's okay. It's only bird shit.

Chrissy calms herself and stops crying for a moment. Then she looks down at her dirty clothes and goes nuts again.

Samantha
Real smart, Teeny

Teeny
I didn't know.

Samantha
Next time think. You don't always have to be the center of attention, you know?

Teeny looks at the ground, rejection waves heavily on her.

Teeny
I'm sorry.

Ext. Barn - Moments later

The birds pass over and out of sight. Samantha watches as they fly away.

Page 47

Samantha
They're gone.

Ext. Pond - Moments

Teeny and Samantha, fully dressed, stand on a small cliff. Below them a sparkling. fresh water stream. Samantha jumps. Teeny follows. Splash! They dive into the water, pop their heads up and stand, the water up to their waists.

Teeny
Are you still mad at me?

Samantha ponders the question then smiles.

Samantha
Teeny, even if I try, I can't stay mad at you.

Teeny's all smiles. She splashes Samantha. Samantha returns the favor.

Chrissy (O.S.)
Wooooooooooooooooooo!

Chrissy slides down the hill on her butt. Ouch. She lands in the water with a splash. Samantha and Teeny applaud as Chrissy pop her head up. She stands in the water and takes a bow.

Roberta (O.S.)
Lookout beloooow!

The girls look up to see -- Roberta standing on a tall tree branch, hanging over the water. It's a twenty foot dive into waist high water.

Samantha
Roberta don't. It's too shallow.

Roberta
Bombs away.

She dives off the branch and disappears into the water. The girls watch for her to come up for air, but she doesn't pop out of the water.

Samantha
Where is she?

Page 48

Teeny dives under the water. Chrissy panics.

Chrissy
Roberta?

Samantha dives under as Teeny comes up for air.

Chrissy's POV. - Down stream, Roberta floats toward the shoreline, her face in the water.

Chrissy
No!

Teeny grabs Samantha and they swim as fast as they can toward Roberta. Chrissy follows, but as always lags way behind. Teeny and Samantha grab Roberta, drag her out of the water and onto the shore. Samantha puts her ear to Roberta's mouth.

Samantha
She's not breathing.

Teeny
Somebody's gotta give her mouth to mouth.

Samantha
I'll do CPR. You do mouth to mouth.

Teeny
Other way around.

Chrissy finally reaches them.

Chrissy
Out of the way.

She takes charge and shoves Samantha and Teeny aside. When she bends down to start mouth to mouth resuscitation-- squirt. Roberta spits a mouth full of water into her face.

Roberta
I'm touched.

She was faking the entire time. Everyone falls back, relieved.

Roberta (to Samantha and Teeny)
It's good to know who your true friends are.

Teeny
Hey, I was gonna do it.

Samantha
Me too.

Page 49

Roberta
Yeah, right.

Roberta swings her arm around Chrissy.

Roberta
Chrissy here's the only one who --

Chrissy draws her fist back and pow! She socks Roberta in the eye.

Chrissy
Don't you ever do anything like that again. Ever!

They're all momentarily stunned. Violence is not one of Chrissy's character traits.

Roberta
It was just a joke.

Samantha (V.O.)
That wasn't the first time Roberta faked her own death. Earlier that year, during a slumber party at Teeny's house, she held her breath until she passed out. And the year before, she scared the hell out of us when she jumped off her roof and pretended she broke her neck.

We hear a splash!

Teeny
What was that?

We hear voices and laughter coming from around the river bend. Samantha and Teeny leave to 
check it out.

Roberta
I'm sorry. (as Chrissy pouts)
Look, if it means anything, I really appreciate that you would've done the mouth to mouth thing.

Chrissy
You scared me to death.

Roberta
I'm sorry.

Chrissy
You're my best friend, Roberta.

It's a moment. Roberta smiles, embarrassed.

Page 50

Roberta (making a fist)
Helluva right hook you've got there.

Chrissy
Don't swear.

Teeny (O.S.) (quietly)
You guys, come here.

Roberta and Chrissy join Samantha and Teeny. They peak over the top of the ridge. Chrissy gasps.

Girls POV. - The Wormers skinny dip in the river. Buck naked, Scott climbs out onto a tree branch and dives into the water. We see a lot of white butts as the brothers roughhouse.

Back to Scene

The girls duck down behind the hill.

Teeny
Oh. My. God. I saw his penis.

Samantha & Roberta
Whose?

Chrissy (reprimanding)
You guys.

Teeny
And the balls.

Samantha & Roberta
Whose?

Teeny
Scott's.

Samantha and Roberta peak back over the ledhe and stare wide eyed at Scott's penis. The duck back down behind the hill.

Samantha & Roberta
Oh my God!

Chrissy
Great, now I'm the only one who hasn't seen Scott's thing.

Roberta
So?

Page 51

Chrissy
I know you guys. It'll be the topic of conversation for the rest of the summer. You're forcing me to look.

Samantha
Nobody's forcing you to do anything.

Chrissy
Okay, I'll look. But, I want to make it clear. I'm looking under protest.

Teeny
Yeah, right.

Chrissy peaks over the hill and stares with a blank look on her face that doesn't change. The others look at her curiously as she climbs back down, unfazed.

Chrissy
It's not very big.

The other girls bust up laughing.

Chrissy
What's so funny?

Roberta
It's only big when the guy has a hard on.

Teeny
And when that happens, they get like -- (gesturing two feet) -- this big.

Samantha
I walked in on my dad in the bathroom once. And I saw his, you know, balls. Well, let me tell you... once guys get older, they hang down like cow utters.

Teeny and Roberta
Gross.

Chrissy
What's a hard on?

They all give her looks.

Samantha
Doesn't your mother tell you anything?

Chrissy (distressed)
I'm beginning to think she's been misinformed.

Page 52
 
Roberta's gaze shifts toward a pile of clothes hanging in the bushes across the way. Roberta nudges Samantha, who nudges Teeny, who nudges Chrissy. They all have the same idea andsmile simultaneously.

Roberta
Let's do it.

Roberta sneaks toward the Wormer's clothes. Her friends follow suit.

Samantha
Get ready to make a mad dash for the bikes.

Roberta (to Chrissy)
You better start now.

Chrissy
Buzz off hog head.

Roberta
I'm serious. Get going.

Chrissy gives in and heads toward the covered bridge.

Teeny
This is too easy.

The stand at the edge of the cliff and call down to the boys.

Roberta
Hey, Wormers.

The boys look up.

Roberta
It's pay back time.

Roberta waves a pile of clothes.

Roberta
Come and get 'em suckers

Scott
You better put those down.

Roberta
Dream on, asshole!

Covering their privates, the Wormers rip out of the water and make a mad dash for the girls.

Page 53

The girls run toward their bikes, clothes in tow. The chase is on, across a meadow toward the barn. The girls reach their bikes as a car approaches. The Wormers duck behind an assortment of trees and bushes. Scott peeks out from behind a tree, suddenly very vulnerable.

Scott
Come on, jokes over, huh?

Roberta
Wrong!

The girls hop on their bikes and start down the road.

Roger
Give us our clothes, damn it.

Clay and Eric (suddently sweet)
Pleeeease

Chrissy
Come and get 'em nimrods.

As the girls peddle toward the home stretch of their journey, they drop an item of clothing about every fifty feet.

The Wormers dart from trees to bushes as they hide from passing cars and gather their clothes.

The girls hoot and holler, enjoying the show.

Roberta (ecstatic)
All for one and one for all.

They join hands and ride side by side down the road.

Ext. Geenfield Library - Late afternoon

Int. Library Basement

It's dimly lit and musty. The girls sit at a large table and flip through pages of old newspaper headlines, now hard bound for a quick reference. Chrissy sneezes.

Page 54

Chrissy
I think I'm allergic to dust.

Roberta slams shut a book. Dust scatters and Chrissy sneezes again.

Chrissy
Thanks.

Roberta scoots the book aside.

Roberta
Nothing happened in April.

Teeny
Nothing ever happens in Shelby.

Chrissy
I kind of like it that way.

Roberta stands and reviews the shelves of hard bound newspapers. Samantha reaches the end of her book and closes it.

Samantha
Nothin' (to Teeny)
What month is that?

Teeny
May.

Roberta brings a book back to the table, sits down and flips through the newspaper articles. She stares at an article.

Angle on: A 1962 photo and headline...Local Teacher Killed. A large photo shows a car smashed to hell. Besides it, there's a smaller photo. The same picture Roberta carries in her back pocket.

Roberta reads the article. Chrissy notices her and watches the look on Roberta's face change from curious to pained.

Chrissy
What's wrong?

Roberta
It's my mom.

They all look at the newspaper. The picture says it all. It was a violent end. As Roberta reads:

Roberta
It was a head on collision. The driver of the pick up truck fell asleep at the wheel.

Page 55

She was pinned in the car for an hour and a half before they could get her out. She was fully conscious while rescue workers attempted her extraction from the demolished vehicle. She died during the night at Green County Hospital of massive head injuries and severe internal bleeding.

Roberta stares at the picture of the smashed car. She seems anguished and confused.

Roberta
I don't understand this.

Chrissy
What do you mean?

She doesn't respond to Chrissy's question and continues to stare at the photo.

Roberta
It must have been awful for her. (imagining)
A lot of pain.

Teeny swallows hard, choked up. Nobody knows what to say. Chrissy reaches for Roberta's handand holds it in hers. Roberta welcomes her friend's comfort. Heavy tears fill Roberta's eyes butshe fights them.

Roberta (trying not to cry)
She was really beautiful, wasn't she?

Teeny
Like a movie star.

Suddenly embarrassed, Roberta tries to compose herself. She wipes her runny nose with her shirt sleeve then stands and carries the book across the room. She xeroxes a copy of the article. Herfriends watch her, wishing they knew what to say.

Roberta carefully folds the xerox and slips it into her pocket. She returns to the table. Everyone silently continues the search for Dear Johnny's obituary.

As they flip through pages and pages of old newspapers Teeny quietly hums to herself. We make out the tune to be the Carpenters, "Close to You". Without thinking, Samantha joins in the humming. Soon after, Chrissy hums along also. Even Roberta can't resist.

Samantha
Wait, I think I found something.

Page 56

Teeny
Read it...

Samantha (reading)
Funeral services will be held on Saturday for 12 year old Jonathan Simms and his mother 36 year old Beverly Anne Simms. Services begin at noon at the third street Presbyterian Church. The grieving husband and father asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be given to the church. Due to the unexpected and tragic circumstances involving the deaths, the family has asked that the services remain private and ...

Samantha turns the page, looking for more.

Samantha (surprised)
That's it.

Teeny
What do you mean, that's it. How did they die?

Samantha flips a few pages forward.

Samantha
Wait a minute. The book skips from June 12 to June 16th. Four pages are missing.

Samantha opens the book as wide as possible, revealing --

Samantha
They've been torn out. (reeling them in) 
Somebody has gone to a lot of trouble to keep Dear Johnny's death a mystery.

Ext. Country Road - Late Afternoon

The girls tackle the long ride home. Roberta, still a little emotionally removed, leads the pack, a few yards ahead of the others.

Teeny
I wonder how they died.

Page 57
 
Samantha
I think we need to be very cautious about who we talk about this with.

Chrissy
Why?

Samantha
Because it's entirely possible that whoever ripped those pages out of the library in Greenfield started the fire at the Shelby Library.

The others silently agree. As the peddle through the rolling countryside:

Samantha (V.O.)
Shelby, Indiana was not the most exciting place to grow up. In fact, the most common cause of death before puberty was boredom. Our quest for the tree house was all we had to look forward to that summer... until we discovered the suspicious lack of details surrounding Dear Johnny's death. It was like a gift from God. A mystery only we could solve. The four of us had no way of knowing the answers we were lookig for would change each one of us forever.

Ext. Country Road - Early Evening

The girls continue their journey home as day becomes evening. They pass another sign - Shelby 2 miles. Almost home.

They slowly gain ground on a hitchhiker. He is Private James Conelly (19), a Vietnam vet. Still wearing half his uniform, he back packs down the road, with a slight limp. Teeny is the first to ride past him.

Teeny
Hi.

Conelly
Hi.

She circles around and rides back to him. The other girls catch up. Curious, they size up the vet as they head down the road together. He wears an earring, pony tail and a friendly smile.

Roberta
Are you in the army?

 Page 58

Conelly
Was.

Samantha
Vietnam?

Conelly
Was.

Roberta
Did you kill anyone over there?

Conelly
Not because I wanted to.

Teeny (noticing his limp)
Did you get shot?

"Mama told Me" by Three Dog Night plays comes on Teeny's transistor radio.

Conelly
Good song.

Teeny studies his face. He's handsome. Interesting. Older, but not too old. Teeny pulls a Orange Crush bottle out of her bicycle basket.

Teeny
Wanna sip?

Conelly takes the soda.

Conelly
Thanks.

He swigs then hands it back to her.

Roberta
Does your leg still hurt?

Conelly
Like hell, but getting shot was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Roberta
What do you mean?

Conelly
It got me a seat on a plane home.

Samantha looks at him with keen interest, waiting to hear more. He offers no more, until she probes.

 Page 59

Samantha
But we're winning, right?

Conelly
Nobody's winning.

Conelly sits down in the grass, pulls out a cigarette and lights it. He notices the girls watching him and offers over the pack.

Conelly
Smoke?

A moment. They realize he's treating them like adults.

Samantha         Teeny         Roberta
Sure                 Yeah          I'd love a smoke.

The climb off their bicycles and join him in the grass. Chrissy reluctantly follows. Samantha takes a cigarette from the pack and Conelly lights it for her. Samantha takes a drag and exhales.

Samantha
Smooth.

Teeny lights up. Followed by Roberta. Conelly offers a cigarette to Chrissy who shakes her head no.

Chrissy
Smoking stunts your growth.

Conelly looks her over and cracks a slight smile.

Conelly
You're funny.

They pass around the Orange Crush and enjoy their smokes.

Samantha
On the news they said the U.S. was really starting to gain ground over there.

Conelly
Forget what you saw on the news, okay? You can't believe what you see about it, or what you read about it, or what someone tells you. Even people who have been there lie about what they've seen... (with remorse) ... or done.

They sit in a moment of silence. Samantha takes a drag off of her cigarette. She exhales and watches the smoke rise up and fade away.

Page 60

Samantha
It doesn't seem like we can believe in much anymore.

Chrissy and Teeny look at her, not understanding where this sentiment comes from.

Roberta
No, it doesn't.

Roberta takes a long, deep drag off her cigarette.

Conelly
Yourself maybe, if you're lucky.

Samantha immediately feels a kinship with him. A shared sense of disappointment. After all, he's really no more than a kid himself.

Samantha
Are you going to be sticking around here for awhile?

Conelly
Nah. I try not to stick around anywhere. You know what I mean?

Genuinely having no clue:

Samantha                 Roberta                      Teeny
Yeah                        Sure                           Definitely 

Conelly is different from the local yokels and makes Chrissy nervous. She really looks him over.

Chrissy
Is that an earring you're wearing?

Conelly
Yes.

Chrissy (judgmental)
You're a hippie aren't you?

Conelly (chuckling)
You're a trip. 

Chrissy (holding her ground)
My mom says all hippies are sex fiends.

Conelly
I'm going to tell you something I wish someone would have told me when I was your age.

Page 61

Chrissy (snooty)
And what's that?
