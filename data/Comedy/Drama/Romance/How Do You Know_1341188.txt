WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 1.
FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - SUMMER NIGHT 1

Romantic night - and now moving into camera the couple to
prove it. LISA, a really pretty 27 year old woman who has
made every sacrifice of mind, body and spirit in order not to
feel the way she does at this moment: self-conscious and
threatened by a vague set of ordinary emotions which, worst
of all to her, serve no constructive purpose whatsoever.
Still, here she is, after a lifetime unafraid of anything,
with fear poking secretly away at her while her date, Matty,
(a “hunk” who is frequently mistaken for a “catch”) is in the
background causing a small flurry of excitement signing an
autograph. .He looks and sees her failing to make the turn to
his building. .

MATTY
(calling out)
Left!

Lisa bobbles with distraction and then makes the turn. She is
quickly ensnared by her persistent troubling thoughts.

ON Matty...

As he looks at her and grins with impulse and a veteran’s
sense of mischief based on deep appreciation of the night,
her swirling skirt and the promise of simple pleasures. He
comes up behind her ear and responds to her yelp with the
absolute truth.

MATTY
Night's so great. You look so good.
Just need to grab you.

LISA
Huh. .Sorry I didn‘t..

But that quick he has lifted and swirled her. Then, maybe as

she was just getting into the ride, drops her.

MATTY
We're here..

He gestures with his head to a nearby apartment building, the
best apartment building in town.

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 2.

EXT. APT. BLDG. - NIGHT 2

He walks toward the front door - the doorman greets him by
name..Lisa hesitates, ambivalent..not her usual decisive
self.

LISA
Hey..Matty..I may have to go back
on what I said about finally seeing
your place tonight..there’s a lot
on my mind right now and..

Matty, unaccustomed to even minor adversity, has a flash of
well, not depression..a flash of not feeling fantastic.

MATTY
You sure?
LISA
(Light. .half
laughing. .honest)
Well, no.
MATTY

(cowboy justice)
No pressure here. It should feel
right.

His John Wayne moral center impresses Lisa. .but then he takes
several steps back..

LISA
That’s nice. Thanks. Why are you
moving away?

MATTY
Give you room to think and decide.

The doorman also backs off a few spaces. Lisa looks at the
two men staring at her.

MATTY
Take your time. I get a kick out of
watching you make up your mind.

He means it. He is having a good time giving her space and
enjoying the mystery. She moves forward toward the door.

 

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 3.

LISA
You have all the signs of a
handful .

MATTY
Hope so.

She takes a swing at him, a solid fist and perfectly balanced
are to his stomach...she is surprised by her own action....

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 3

LISA
I'm sorry did I hurt you?

MATTY
dust got me more interested.

He kisses her.

INT. MATTY'S APT. - BEDROOM - MORNING 4

This is a truly expensive apartment -- we are now in the
bedroom where there are a great many trophies in evidence
besides our Lisa, who now lies next to her spanking new lover
having more than held up her end of the just concluded
lengthy and athletic night of love making. She can’t,
however, quite match his grin. Matty’s in a state of some
wonder - celebrating the fact that hig expectations have been
exceeded.

MATTY
Amazing..Female jocks are amazing.

LISA
(a level look)
Could you personalize it a Little?

Matty cracks up..
MATTY
(enthusiastically)
Right, right, right. .I meant it as
tribute to you, Lisa Jorgenson.

Come on, it was amazing, huh? That
was unbelievable.

LISA
Fishing for a compliment?

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 4.

MATTY
(exuberant)
i'm fishing for a celebration.

LISA
I have to get going.

She scoops up her clothes and groans over how wrinkled her
dress is ag she moves toward the bathroom. We move with her --
perhaps noting perfect long smooth muscles in her arms and
legs.

MATTY
(o.c.)
There’s a fresh toothbrush in the
right hand drawer.

INT. MATTY'S APT. - BATHROOM - DAY 5

She stands in front of the sink now and opens the right hand
drawer.

ANGLE ON DRAWER

Two dozen unused toothbrushes lined up -- all in unbroken
glass containers. She takes this in then breaks open the
container and is brushing her teeth when there is a.. knock
on the door..She opens it..

MATTY
You don’t have to wear that dress
home.

He moves past her and opens a cabinet where there is a stack
of unopened women’s sweats.

MATTY
Medium?

He hands her a package. She reacts with extreme distaste..

MATTY
What?

LISA
The stack is a little ---
repulsively unromantic.

MATTY
No it's not. It's classy. I’m being
a good host here.

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09

LISA
It's like I‘m on an assembly line
spitting out girls.

MATTY
That's just negative. Aren't we all
on an assembly line - going through
each other’s lives until one day we
close down the factory, take home a
product and use it monogamously for
the rest of our lives?

She starts putting on her dress.

LISA
Matty, my mistake. .forget about it.

MATTY
If I hid the rest and gave you one
I'd be a great guy. .but because I
am open with you...
she moves past him heading for the front door.

LISA
dust forget it!

MATTY (CONT'D)
Too bad.

CAMERA MOVES AHEAD OF THEM

INT. MATTY’S APT. - HALLWAY/BEDROOM

6

This is purposefully a traditional romantic vignette of hurt

woman, with a backbone, about to express herself with

forceful exit..it‘s why doors were made to slam.

and then that quick she catches herself - holding the door in
pre-slam wind-up then turns toward him, genuinely apologetic.

. LISA

Hey Matty...What am I doing? I know
better.. “Don't judge anybody
before you check yourself out.
You're lucky when it's your fault
because then you can correct the
situation.”

(working it out as if with

a friend)

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 6.

LISA (cont 'd)

I'm nervous over something and a
little worried so I ended up with

, an attractive guy who you'd have to
be an idiot to mistake for serious
material..for anything but a fun
friendship -- and rather than
accept the evening as a chance to
hide out from myself with some
really amazing sex, I start to give
him a hard time for just being who
he is. I really apologize. Please,
forgive me.

MATTY
You may be my “dream girl.”

She grabs her panties and exits.

LISA
You take care.

MATTY
What are you worried about,
anyways?
LISA
(forcefully)
Nothing! I can't believe I’m
whining about it. Crap!

As she turns away.

EXT. STREET - DAY 7
Lisa -- wrinkled dress -- stops —~ takes running shoes from
her purse and puts them on. .She then moves purposefully. -her

walk arresting in its precision and power. ..passing
people. ..she ig in a hurry..

INT. SUBWAY - DAY 8

Lisa standing -- her face tight

EXT. MIDDLE CLASS STREET - NEAR LISA'S APT. - DAY 9

As Lisa moves down a lower middle class block to her apt.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 7.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY 10

As she stops at the foot of the stairs to open a compartment
and withdraw a weighted vest which she puts on..and then
begins to hop up the stairs two at a time..It's a hell of a
stunt..as hard as it looks and this image, of athlete
straining, while wearing a hopelessly wrinkled party dress is
strangely a very appropriate image for what awaits her.

INT. LISA’S APT. - DAY. 11

Easily as many trophies as Matty (including two Olympic gold
medals)..inevitable rows of team pictures, she cares about
team. (Note: how they are displayed is a project for us.)
Furniture is very basic..one of those L shaped rooms with the
bend of the “L” considered the bedroom -- pullout sofa. .She
walks directly to a desk on which sits her computer.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER

Lisa pauses over the keys. She sniffs the air, oxygen her
long time elixir. She does not touch the keys; instead moving
off and leaving the scene. We hear the shower start.

INT. LISA'S APT. - CLOSE ON LISA - A BIT LATER 12

As she sits again at the computer. Here's the thing about
this moment. In the truest sense of the word we are
witnessing an act of private bravery. Lisa's life, as she
knows it and has lived it, is on the line. Yet, the signs are
small as she weighs her dicey options for survival.

CLOSE ON COMPUTER

As Lisa hits the site of the “UNITED STATES NATIONAL SOFTBALL
ASSOCIATION.” She clicks on “NEW ROSTER OF PLAYERS” ..And then
reads: “THIS YEAR’S ROSTER IS DELAYED.”

ON LISA

She is struck by foreboding and simultaneously beats the
feeling back. Her fingers take action..she clicks her way to
on-line ticketing and confirms “least expensive” trip to
Phoenix. A cute tone confirms she has scored for a ticket.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 8.

EXT. NATIONAL TEAM ATHLETIC COMPLEX - TRACKING WITH LISA 13

It is off-seagon but there are college athletes and national
players working on some drills which look enormously hard to
do. When the players spot Lisa they stop immediately. .a
subtle flurry of hero worship ensues. . She exchanges a deep
hug with one or two of her teammates. .

INT, ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - WOMEN’S WING - EDIT BAY - DAY 14

This is the home of champions. Olympic memorabilia in
evidence. NCAA Champion cups, etc. She is drawn to one
crowded editing bin cubicle where coaches and a few athletic
tech support persons watch a television set in a darkened
area. As she passes SALLY, an assistant coach (late 30's-
early 40's -- clearly athletic looking) calls to her.

SALLY
Hey..my fave. What are you doing
here? I didn’t think I'd see you
till the Jersey clinic. We’re just
editing the promotional video.
(to student editor)
Show her part..

Lisa indicates she'd rather not..Sally gestures forcefully
that she should see it.

LISA
Just for a minute.

Before the student editor scrolls the images, Lisa is there
sticking out her hand.

LISA
Lisa Jorgenson.

The student is flattered and gives her name, Jane.

LISA
Good to meet you.

Lisa retreats to the background. We alternate between THE
MONITOR and Lisa, who is a little self-conscious being eyed
by others as she witnesses her own past glories.

ON MONITOR

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 9.

ANNOUNCER
Co-captain and second baseman Lisa
Jorgenson - ended Australia’s
rally..and secures the cup. .The
United States wins its 7th world
championship.

We see a montage of Lisa’s steller play in this game ending
with a backdoor slide, scoring the winning run, after which
she roars in competitive exultation at the opposing catcher.

ANNOUNCER
(horribly fake chuckle)
Captain Jorgenson is the mother hen
of the celebration.

VARIOUS SHOTS..Lisa making sure everyone is taken care
of..she stops one of the players from taking off her shirt
ala Brandy Chastain ..she is also trying to gather her
teammates to shake hands with the Australian team. .she
herself providing spirited consolation to the Australian
girls, simultaneously fighting off her own teammates who are
trying to lift her on their shoulders and somehow getting
them to lift the coach instead..we additionally see her
lifting Sally--a tearful moment for each.

ON LISA
Strangely turned shy by the feelings evoked. Enough.

LISA
Enough. .

On the video, the stars and stripes are raised. .She
successfully fights off emotion but comment is required.

LISA
Whew.

As Lisa prepares to leave the room.

SALLY
Did coach call you here?

LISA
Nope. Just thought I should speak
to him while it could still maybe
do some good.
1s INT. ATHLETIC DEPT. HALLWAY/COACH'S OFFICE - DAY 15

Sally follows her into the hallway.
16

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 10.

SALLY
Wow...The roster’s never been this
late..but no..you can’t be on any
bubble. .

LISA
I was in the top box of his
triangle of success chart in 17 of
the 19 categories.

SALLY
Well, oh my God then, so why? You
think ‘cause Cam is on the college
team here he could go with her? No.
she’s not there yet..dust honestly.

LISA
It's just the last couple of days
an alarm'’s gone off and it feels
more like..truth than nervous crap.

SALLY
Well, hell -- go in. Find out for
sure you're okay and we'll grab a

beer.

Lisa nods...and walks toward the office. The nameplate next
to the door reads “WILLIAM SMITH Head Coach.” Sally can’t
resist getting in her ear to render last minute coaching when
she sees Lisa tense.

SALLY
(sotto)
Confident, confident, relaxed,
confident.. You are the best.

Sally peals off and Lisa pauses a beat. It’s game face time.

INT. COACH SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY 16

She enters the coach’s office overplaying her sense of
security and confidence by a mile or so.

LISA
Hey, coach. How's it going?

WILLIAM SMITH is a good looking guy who excels at pushing and
manipulating others. He is surprised to see Lisa.

COACH SMITH
Hey, you. What‘s doing?

 
17

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 11.

LISA
You have a minute?

COACH SMITH
Sure.

LISA
I've been following the training
guide you sent but doing two a days
and I have shaved my time where you
wanted by point 8.

COACH SMITH
Really good...but two a days can
create different kinds of problems.

LISA
Okay, 1/11 stop. Good seeing you.
Thanks for the time.

COACH SMITH
sure.

She exits.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 17

As she sits in a full plane returning to Washington
D.C...opens an old play book -- she is ‘acting” as if she
were untroubled even though no one is watching.

EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY - VERY CLOSE ON LISA 18

Liga working out with several girls from the national

team. .She is fielding hot fungoes in a circle with
teammates..little grunts..small off-camera utterances, as
they encourage each other..Lisa’s phone starts to ring -- she
hears the distinctive music, turns, and, not seeing the ball
coming at her, takes one hard on the face. She has a bloody
lip..The injury is close to an absolute non-event for her.
She spits some blood with enviable expertise as she walks to
her bag on the sidelines.

LISA
It better be worth it.
(she answers her phone)
Hello.

Intercut with:

 
19

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 12.

INT. OFFICE - DAY 19

GEORGE MADISON, in his mid 30’s. If anyone faults him as
colorless it is because they have never paused on a foggy
morning to consider the vibrancy of grey.. He is solid:
solidly educated, solid in thought and deed and carry
through. And, of course, so many mentions of the word “solid”
portends that he will soon break apart from the intensity of
some serial migfortunes which will make it forever impossible
(as a character will soon remark) to ever again be the person
he is at this moment.

GEORGE
Hi.

(checks a piece of paper)
Liga... This is George Madison. Did
Riva tell you that she gave me your
number?

LISA
No.
GEORGE

She said it might be a good idea
for us to have dinner together.

LISA
Oh..well, let me call her...when
did you have in mind?

GEORGE
No. I wasn’t calling to set a time.
She didn’t know I was seeing

someone -- well, she didn't know
that it had escalated a bit, at
least on my part -- it just added

up for me suddenly and...
(catching himself at
giving too much
information)

Well, anyway...

Lisa seizes on the fun of his oddness..she grins, blood from
the hit on her lip covering her front teeth.

LISA
...80 you're calling me to break
up.

Her teammates gather around on hearing this -- she grins a
bloody grin and gestures that the call is off the charts
goofy. So much so she is enjoying herself.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 13.

GEORGE
I just didn’t think...

A woman enters his office with George’s secretary, ANNIE, a
few steps behind trying to stop her. .they are briefly out of
focus, as we remain concentrated on the phone call as George
attempts to do the same.

WOMAN
George Madison?

He nods - but indicates he has a call to complete. Annie
gives a short hand whispered message.

ANNIE
She just..the rudeness. .

George nods, pats the distraught Annie on the back.

GEORGE
(into phone)
I’m sorry..I got distracted. What
was I saying?

LISA
“You just didn't think..”

GEORGE
Right..thank you.
(to Annie)
Thank you.

The woman ig surprised, unaccustomed to being thanked.

WOMAN
(ironically)
You're welcome.

She exits.

GEORGE
(into phone)
Thank you for holding..I just
didn’t think it was right not to
phone you once I took your number
in case she had talked to you and
you were expecting my call.

LISA
Uh-huh. Okay, then...It was nice of
you to call in a way I guess.
20

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 14.

GEORGE
Right. Sorry for interrupting your
day.
LISA
Yeah.
GEORGE
Goodbye.

He hangs up and mutters to himself..unconscious to the fact
that he is doing so..

GEORGE
CouldIhavesoundedstranger?

He looks down at the folder for the first time.

GEORGE
Oh my God.

INT. UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON 20

As a class breaks the students. . (grad students) flow
out...signs, blackboard, etc. indicate that it is a PHYSICS
CLASSROOM... .George is off to the side sending a text
message...We read it.

GEORGE'S TEXT MESSAGE
Dad? It’s important that we talk. I
need some guidance and maybe Ron
should be folded in as well. 1'11
be in early - Okay - be well.

He finishes and looks off into space and shudders suddenly
and unexpectedly. .registers surprise. It’s a first. He has
never shuddered before. Now the Physics professor comes into
view. This is TERRY DREISER, she is in the argument for the
smartest woman alive - a physicist whose mind holds the
promise of one day explaining it all to us. She is surprised
to see him..

TERRY
George, am I wrong, didn’t I tell
you I'm crashing on the book
tonight?

She holds up the portable data plug which contains all her
work...

 
21

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 1s.

GEORGE
Yeah, you did..I just..I’m not
going to stay around.

INT. CRAMPED ACADEMIC OFFICE - DAY 21

As they enter --- her work is all laid out for her.. A
waiting work cocoon of perfect reading light. .books..two
computers and many, many stacks of research..She must move
sideways to get into the cramped work area where she puts
HER DATA PLUG into its computer port and the screen comes
alive with physics. .words and computations.

TERRY
Maybe that’s better for tonight. I
don’t know why I agreed to this
delivery date..damn me and my need
for approval. .Sorry.

She slides into the cocoon -- no small feat.

GEORGE
Sure. It was nice seeing your face
for a minute. Settles me down.

TERRY
Anyway, I think I know what it is
that's bothering you..

George is puzzled by this.

TERRY

(crossing to him.)
If you're concerned about us now
that we've intensified..we're okay.
I am busy so I can’t demonstrate to
you that we’re okay in all the
little ways like paying attention
to you..but if you could just take
my word for it until the work lets
up that would really help me... and

us.
(beguiling)
I think I like that word better.
Us.
GEORGE
Ok.
TERRY

Thanks. Kiss.
22

23

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 16.

She slides out with some difficulty. .He kisses her.

TERRY
Hot kiss.

He hot kisses her. She moans, pulls him closer with a long
leg..Terry has the ability to get instantly hot... and when
her very plump brain cells get that blood flow, insights
result.

TERRY
(hot and free)
Don't let me get away with too much
- that will never work for me ~
don't be too low maintenance that’s
a ticking bomb.. but thanks for
understanding this one.

George is getting aroused... but not for long. She breaks
off.

TERRY
See. We're good.

He nods and exits as she turns back to her work, then turns
realizing a beat late that her turn-on and sudden turn-off
was sort of funny/strange..she flashes a good guy smile and
shrugs.

EXT. GREAT CAMPUS - DAY 22

As George walks off -- he moves past an outdoor job fair
where dozens of corporations are interviewing soon to be
MBA’s potential employees..an assembly line where the biggest
start to package the best.

EXT. RUNNING AREA - NATIONAL MALL - EARLY MORNING 23

A foot race in progress...Lisa pounding the composite surface
alongside a girl, RIVA, maybe eight years younger. Lisa, even
while running remembers something suddenly. .

LISA
(gasping)
Gotta talk to you after.

RIVA
(gasping less)
I'll wait for you at the finish.
24

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 17.

LISA
Sense of humor.

She turns it on and it is fiercely competitive -- “full out”
as few experience the term. Riva wins barely. CAMERA REMAINS
LOOKING STRAIGHT UP THE TRACK as each of the women goes to a
different side of frame to heave. It is a common occurrence.

EXT. OUTDOOR AREA - DAY 24

The two women have just ordered breakfast.

LISA
So... You gave my number to a guy?

RIVA
Yeah. I hardly know him..he went to
business school with my brother...

LISA
How come you gave him my number
anyway?

RIVA

You don’t remember Wednesday night--
you said you had never dated a non-
athlete and maybe you should try

one. .

LISA
I did?

RIVA
Yeah.

LISA

Don't listen to me when I'm
drinking Guiness.

RIVA
It’s the only time you really say
stuff.

LISA

(briefly worried)
I hope that’s not true.

INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE - DAY 25

George is seated at a gide chair.. Annie opens the door and
is quickly shoved aside by George's father CHARLES, vibrant
with an energy which leaves no doubt he came up through sales
and RON, the company’s legal counsel, who seems to squirt
Protestant genes as he walks with perfect posture.

GEORGE
Good morning, Dad...
CHARLES
You said, bring the company

lawyer..

George hands his father the subpoena. .Ron reads over Charles’
shoulder. They each react instantly -- simultaneously
shaken...Charles doesn’t trust himself to speak..he hands the
paper to Ron and paces off.

RON
(to Charles)
They are apparently investigating
us for possible misstatement of
receivables to inflate earnings.

CHARLES
What do you know about this?

GEORGE
Nothing. But I’m responsible.

CHARLES
What are you being noble. .?

GEORGE
I'm telling you what all recent
legislation says. If it’s true and
I didn’t know, I should have.

CHARLES
The goddamn government’ s become
like this horrible, punishing

Mommy -

RON
Could you ask your assistant to
come in -- we’re going to have to

respond immediately.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 19.

GEORGE
Excuse me, Annie...could you please
come on in and bring your laptop?

Annie enters and looks at George -- worried about him. .She

has worked for him for some time. She adores him. Ron is
clearly grave.

RON
All these items mentioned -- you
must have checked whether we had
actual receipt of funds before we
talked to the analysts..

GEORGE
No..most of them came from Dad‘s
office so I assumed...

His father makes a strangled half-bark of a noise and George
glances at him.

CHARLES
You don’t assume or trust anyone. .
not him..certainly not me..

RON
Good guidelines I'm afraid.

GEORGE
(continuing)
..with everyone working creatively
on the new line I thought I'd wait
until..

Another noise from Dad. Annie stands just behind him -- she

is unable to conceal the concerns and emotions born of her
ferocious loyalty to George.

GEORGE
Just a second, Dad... There’s an
overall involved here. My approach
is different than yours was, which
I tried to make clear when I took
over, And it’s to get finance and
legal out of the way of the
creative.

Charles makes a disparaging noise then:
CHARLES

(about to take over)
Okay, now...
~~~

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 20.

GEORGE
(softly but firm)
Let me finish, please.

CHARLES
No. Drivel doesn’t get to finish.
Drivel gets interrupted.

George continues nonetheless. His earnestness is palpable
and, given his audience, ill advised.

GEORGE
So...shaping the corporate culture
may not bring results as quickly on
the income statement as just
eliminating jobs and wacking
expenses. But, with patience it
will work and, when it does, you've
puilt something.

CHARLES
(shout ing)
You are a fucking moron.
(catching himself)
Too rough..

RON
Much too rough.

GEORGE
Don’t use that language in front of
Annie.

CHARLES

Okay. I caught myself. Now may I
get back to the fucking, sorry
Annie, the fucking, sorry again
Annie...point!

(to George)
You talk “creativity” to me? You
M.B.A./C.P.A. You are a numbers
man. You have one job you are
suited for and that’s to be
practical pig and make sure we
build with bricks here. You are
supposed to know the temper of

these times -- in particular....the
one SPIRIT DRAINING FACT of our
lives:

(resuming)
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 21.

CHARLES (cont'd)

We are potential raw material for
the blame industry..all it takes is
for one of us to stumble on any of
the trip wires our government has
planted.. and the booby trap is
sprung... How many former major men
must shuffle past you into ruin
pefore you realize our lives depend
on never forgetting that any
executive stupid enough...

(having committed to anger

he taps into a well of

genuine rage)
...to sell his product with too
much enthusiasm or optimism...

(parenthetical thought)
...and God forbid cause anyone to
expect that his firm may make an
extra penny or two in whatever
quarter is about to sucker punch us
with more competition from an
UNREGULATED foreign country..

Charles stumbles with near miraculous smoothness to his
original thought.

CHARLES
(continued)
..-will be buried alive..

CAMERA MOVES to feature Annie who is having an out-of-body
experience hearing the favorite boss of her life so raked
over the coals.

CHARLES

(continued)
I've overlooked every limitation I
know you to have because you are my
son. And you're a good guy, as
every prick with half a brain who
ever took advantage of you knows
absolutely. But there is a bottom
line which, because of your notions
of trust and...

(none have said the next

word with such sarcasm)
“creativity,” we may inevitably be
forced to crawl on by some
assistant U.S.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 22.

CHARLES (cont'd)
Attorney who at this moment is
answering a roommate wanted ad in
Brighton and, as his first
professional act, will slay us for
his 80 thousand a year, as he
migrates to a future of defending
us for millions a year..and if this
almost -made-the-law review creature
pins me between a choice of saving
you or the company I founded and
you preside over I think you should
know that I will choose the company
even though doing so may break my
life forever...which is finally my
fault for handing you a job where
your assumptions or notions of
trust can cause such calamity!

Suddenly, in a visceral reflex, Annie takes a swing at
Charles.. George grabs her hand stopping her just in time.
She is shocked by her own action.

ANNIE
(sotto to George)
My god, sorry.

Charles hasn’t noticed..Ron, who witnessed the episode, is
about to confront Annie but George moves quickly, addressing
his father and thereby forces a change of focus.

GEORGE

That might have been better in
private.. To my knowledge I did
nothing wrong but, even if I did, I
don’t want anyone saving me. Ron,
why don’t you have Annie take down
what you need?

(pointedly)
Okay?

He is clearly asking Ron to overlook Annie's swing.

RON
(a beat then)
Alright..You should go home now and
think about interviewing attorneys.
I don’t know whether circumstances
will allow the company to pay..-

CHARLES
The company will pay!
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 23.

Charles crosses to George as Ron begins dictating to Annie
whose fingers fly across the keys with world class speed,
even while trying to get the upper hand on her emotions. A
legalize preamble begins in the background. .NOTE RESEARCH FOR
EXACT COPY.

George begins to feel his life slipping on its foundations.
His father interrupts his dismal reverie.

CHARLES
George, don’t take what I just said
personally.

Charles’ lips pucker and he moves in for a kiss on George’s
cheek. As George moves his head out of range.

GEORGE
(incredulous)
Don’t take it personally?

CHARLES
(anguished)
I was out of body. Non-specific
anger. It was strange. I care
about two things: you and this
place. So I went off.. But, no
matter what, I love you.

Charles’ lips pucker again. George decides to accept this,
nonetheless he has found his own bottom line.

GEORGE
I'd rather you didn’t kiss me
right now.

CHARLES
Understood.

As George prepares to exit, Annie, even as she continues to
type, feels the need to call out to him.

ANNIE
George, everything will be fine.

GEORGE
Thank you.

Ron gives Annie an admonishing look.
ANNIE

{decisively to Ron)
It will!

George has exited the building and stands momentarily dazed
before moving on.

RON
Just a minute..
(he speed dials his phone)

Following is intercut between Ron at the second floor window
and George who stops in the street, others flowing by.

GEORGE
Hello?

RON
I've been through things like this
and I'd like to give you some
difficult advice..if you'd like to
hear it.

George pauses..actively considering whether he does..finally:

GEORGE
(into phone)
Okay.

RON
Accept the enormity. Give up
illusions of containment.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 25.

RON (cont'd)
The hardest fact of all is that, no
matter what the outcome, it is
unlikely that you can ever again be
the person you’ve been until now.

GEORGE
Okay, thanks. Look, let me call you
later.
RON

Sorry. Any other contact now would
be inappropriate. Good luck,
George.

He hangs up and as Ron continues in the bg George continues
his walk toward his be-clouded future as we lose him in the

No problem.....- Now? !?

Could you please stop asking that?

MATTY'S VOICE
Sorry....but...well..n..soon,

LISA’S VOICE

Now....-
(visceral orgasmic
comment )

Thank you.

MATTY’S VOICE
(equally impassioned and
earnest)
You're welcome. .

Great mutual expressions of pleasure in a jumble..i.e.
“Ladies and Gentlemen, a ten..” “You're good..." "You're
Good...” leading to:

LISA’S VOICE
It takes two.

MATTY
At least.

In the dark we hear Lisa laugh despite herself.

He claps his hands simply and quickly, the lights come on.

Lisa shields her eyes and yelps..-

LISA
You clap your hands to pring on the

MATTY
Why? What's wrong?

LISA
Clapping your hands and those dumb
lights makes me feel like.....----

MATTY
Wait no..don‘t tell me...I think I
get it. Like I’m not thinking about
you .. Sorry. What should I do?

LISA
Turn them off.

MATTY
You wanna turn them off yourself?
(holding programmer)
It's kind of..

LISA
Grow up.
MATTY
(earnestly)
No...

She swats him..the lights go off.

MATTY’S VOICE
It is a little fun to do, isn’t it?

She laughs despite herself. Matty, pleased that he has
disarmed her, presses the point, broadly reading her mind.

INT. TERRY‘S APT. - NIGHT 29

Terry is sitting at her work space.. looking uncomfortable.
George is sitting -- working his phone and his psyche.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 28.

GEORGE

(as he dials)
Hi. This is George. Is he there?

(incredulous)
He still hasn’t checked in?!? Well,
tell him I need to talk to
him. .thank you..have a good day.

(after hanging up)
Where is everybody? Anyway, the
basics are all in my favor.. I
wrote them down.

(reading from list)
One..I didn’t do anything. One “b’-
I don’t agree with my father.. The
legal system, though overloaded, is
about finding the truth. Two...”
You haven't said a word..

TERRY
I'm sorry..just thinking.

A beat as she gnaws at her lip..glances at him then away. He
tries another speed dial.

GEORGE
Hi, is Bryant there yet? This is
George. I need to speak with
him..reach him as soon as you can.
(then to Terry)
Well tell me. You must have some
reaction.

TERRY

I have one. I’m just not proud of
it. It’s just me being analytical.

(realizing she must offer

more)
I was thinking of my work and how
weak gravity is ...

(on his confused reaction)
Let me explain the thought.. We
build these elaborate machines-
these giant colliders to amplify
gravity just to get something
measurable.

GEORGE
(mumbling)
IsitmeorisitherIbetitsme.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 29.

TERRY
(making her point)

while you were talking, I related
the weakness of gravity to your
capacity for feeling good right now
and how I would fail if I tried to
be one of those machines for you.
Using all my energy to produce a
drop of well being in you. That‘s
what I thought.

George doesn’t follow at all.

GEORGE
Since I'd really like to understand
what you just said, could you do me
a favor and talk down to me?

She smiles, truly enjoying his remark, takes a breath
(something like an athlete getting ready for exertion) and
then whispers a final intimacy to him before concluding.

TERRY
This is for us. I swear it.

She kneels before his chair, looking up at him. Okay, maybe
that’s not love light in her eyes but it sure contains some
kindness and affection as it get to the core truth.

TERRY
We are not well matched for this
interval in your life. Not with me
against this deadline. And you --
being investigated. We would not
survive. I don’t want our
relationship to become cannon
fodder for this apparition in your
working life. I’1l be there for you
at the end. You can count on that.

George has to maneuver past some disbelief before he gets it.
GEORGE
You want to split up until I’m
problem free..?

TERRY
No.

GEORGE
You're breaking up .--

energies on...stuff. You think I'm
being horrible. I think I’m being
smart..for us.

George has an adrenaline rush which cracks his
composure. .maybe even a slight stutter as he says:

GEORGE
Okay. Just explain to me. .Would you
mind telling me.. ‘cause this part

seems to be bothering the hell out
of me..how can you be so perfectly
composed right now?

TERRY
No, you're misreading me. I’m
rattled.
(on his reaction)
Yes..This is me rattled.

GEORGE
Well, I disagree.

TERRY
I think I’m the best source for my
own feelings.

Calmly, studiously even, George goes to her desk and grabs
HER DATA PORT from the computer...she screams and shouts as a
mother would for an endangered child..

GEORGE
THAT is you rattled!

He puts the port on her desk and exits. She calls after him.
. TERRY
Cheap parlor trick. I mean it! riz
be here at the end. I do love you.

He exits.

He is looped. It helps his perspective. ..He is even able to
go for another round with his phone.

Hi, George..I've left four messages
with you which said they were
“urgent”..and you know I tend to
underplay, so I can’t understand
your failure to call back.

(new number and horrible

imitation of a game host)
“Hi, George here..you may have just
won thousands of dollars” - will
you call back now..

You still haven’t lost your sense
of humor, have you, pal?

He hangs up. Stillness then the phone rings. He does a broad,
“things are looking up take” then answers.

No, fine and thanks for the call.

ANNIE
I can’t sleep. I don’t know what
got into me this morning..I never
took a swat at anyone but..well, I
do know. I’m almost seven months
pregnant and I’m sure it's a girl

by abiding affection which leads quickly to a misstep.

ANNIE
You're a great boss. You go call
another girl...forward motion;
distract yourself. .they can’t stop
outside girls from talking to you.

GEORGE
Is that it? They're directing
people not to talk to me?

liable financially if I..and with
this new gituation...Oh, the hell

happen. Don't tell me anything.
Good night, Annie.

Oh, sure..How you doing, George?

Sorry to be calling so late. Not

It's okay. What's up?

GEORGE
Would you have dinner with me?

No, no..I/m not,.No...I am not. I

INT. LISA'S APT. - MORNING 36

She is fast asleep on her pull-out sofa as she is awakened by
a phone ringing in the b.g...She has slept 50 fitfully that
it takes her a bit of time to free herself from the sheets
and blankets; which she does with great energy..by the time
she gets to her cell phone, which is attached to its charger,
it has stopped...She looks at the name of the person who has
called, "Sally." She clenches..She goes to her computer and
starts it...under her e-mail is an unopened correspondence
from “The United States Softball Federation... Subject: U.S.A
NATIONAL TEAM ROSTER.” She goes for the moment of clicking it
open, almost as a weight lifter summoning all strength for
the lift..but, at the last minute, foreboding stops her cold
and she doesn’t hit the key- The phone rings again. .in
retreat from the decisive event of her life she exits to:

INT. BATHROOM - MORNING 37

She takes a toothbrush and starts to cry so suddenly that it
comes as a shock to her...she begins to vigorously brush her
teeth, ali the while the phone ringing in the bg. .stopping
and ringing again..a great many people are calling her. She
looks in the mirror giving herself a ferocious, get a grip,
look. She exhales with power and reenters the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 38

She sits down and writes a note to herself. It steadies her.
She picks up the phone. Scrolls past the names of the
teammates who have called her.. .She shuts off her phone --
and with enormous suddenness hits the computer key and
engages the document and whatever it states..

LISA AND THE ROSTER

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 36.

It takes considerably longer to catch on when your name isn’t
there than when it is. _And her’s is nowhere to be found. Her
gaze pauses over the name Cam Austin, 2nd base. There is no
way to exaggerate the scale and heft of this trauma. Even the
word “rape” is no exaggeration - a sudden and perverted
intimacy with the core of your identity. So the moment is
odd... out of body..She goes to the phone..hits a speed dial.

LISA

Daddy? Hey. I just hate to have to’
tell you this..They took Cam over
me. No..I‘m sure. They did. I have
really double checked. .trust me.

(life long habits have her

respond to his urging

despite her own feelings)

Okay, Once eka):

And so she looks at the list again. She is starting to feel
the upset of it all --

LISA
Well, it still isn’t there..well, I
don't think it makes sense either
put they made their choice. No, I
don’t want to get mad. That‘’s not
going to help. Daddy, I called
because you had to hear it from me
and to ask that you do me a favor
and not get too ----

(tries to find the word

and when she does it’s a

tough one)
“Sad” ..over this. .sure. .Okay..maybe
I'm a little angry. .-maybe.

(a dutiful daughter she is

beginning to feel rage)
Because I want to take this in
without being a jerk about it. Can
we please drop it? PLEASE!! I don't
want to be angry right now.

She throws the phone suddenly and violently across the room
where it shatters something.. A beat. .she walks over and
picks up the phone.

LISA (CONT’D)
Daddy? Yeah, hi. .the phone slipped.
Look, .would you mind if I got off
now..just don’t be sad..I don’t
know what I’m going to do..I have a

I didn’t call anyone. .They came
down from Jersey on their own. Who
would want this?

A particularly emotional power hitter grabs Lisa.

PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL GIRL
We're not a team without you and
everyone knows it. He just wanted
Cam because she plays for his
school..we should protest and I
don’t care that it wouldn’t do any
good..a futile act which may do
nothing but destroy all our careers
could be just the thing we need to
bring us together.

Lisa disengages herself and immediately sees...
LISA'S POV

Three of her teammates on the sofa locking at her with
extremely intense empathy.

LISA
(broadly sharp. .joking)
Stop staring at me!?!

There is a knock at the door...someone nearby opens it...an
exquisitely beautiful female athlete of 18 enters. There is
an immediate effect...the room stills creating the aura of
hostility..Lisa, however, feels differently.

LISA
Aw, Cam, honey..you didn’t have to
come.

She almost runs to her..As Lisa hugs her, there is the
following whispered, intimate conversation between them:

LISA
But really something that you
did. .congratulations.

CAM
You‘re so much better than me.

One girl on the sofa turns to her seatmate.

Still hushed intimacies. .-

CAM
He just picked me because I‘m on
his college team.

LISA

Nope. Don't you buy into that
one...he gets three positions with
you which allows him more room to
coach..and you are young, baby. .
That counted for me when I
started..let it count for you..

(turns to room)
Hey everyone, how about Cam coming
here...

(shouts and whistles)
Cam...Cam...Cam..

Reluctantly and half heartedly others join the chant,
gathering steam, making Cam feel more welcomed than
outcast. .Lisa has stepped back and finds herself next to
Sally.

SALLY
The way you're acting gives class a
bad name..

Lisa puts her arm around the older woman. .

SALLY
You know you're allowed to cry-

LISA
I just wish everyone would stop
giving me instructions on how I
should handle this..I gotta go-

SALLY
No you don’t -

LISA
Yes I do. I have a blind date.

SALLY
What are you talking about? We're

LISA

Everyone is bemused. .Lisa has grabbed her purse. - .does some
trick with her clothes to look more datey. And then, out of
respect for her teammates, she stops working so hard at false
energy and faces them for an open moment.

Thanks cor HR), everyone...

But the need to go out like a champion is complex. ..so she
says some words (albeit broadly) joking the heaviness of the
absolute key fact..

LISA
(broadly)
I leoooove you all.

And then, because she is a champion, she gets real and says
it simple and true.

LISA
I do.

various teammates ad lib similar sentiments...including Riva,
(the girl who fixed Lisa up.)

RIVA
What can we do for you?

LISA
Oh, please. .I've been through a lot
worse, .when they dropped softball
from the Olympics, when we lost the
Gold to Japan ..it’s not about me.

would mean I didn’t really know you

George continues to drift in the direction he was
heading...his father following.

GEORGE
Because?..No, you know something -

excitement equalling
hope)
I’m going to treat myself like a
company in trouble.

Depersonalize everything, use what

start with absolute basics.. First
step, identify the problem. For
example, I‘/m aware I’m talking too
fast right now but, as yet, I don’t
have the solution to that
problem. .but what's my take-away in
the meantime?

CHARLES
I think you're just indulging a lot
of neurosis.

GEORGE
Business textbook..you start taking
on too much before you're ready and
the game becomes how much you can
handle instead of how well you
handle it. That applies right now.

George is backing up pretty quickly now.

CHARLES
You don’t have the luxury of not
hearing this.

She is heading, as well, toward the rendezvous. .She looks
especially pretty.- “the stride powerful, graceful.. .the face
soft..CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE TO..

OTHER ANGLE

Now following Lisa from behind..and, after a beat, we begin
to notice people looking at Lisa before the camera moves past
them. .and now as she turns toward us to cross the street..we
gee that some tears are flowing down her face..then her jaw
sets with resolve..she flicks the tears away..and continues. .

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 46

Lisa enters and approaches the Maitre’d

MAITRE‘D
Name please?
LISA
(helplessly)
I'm meeting George. .weimmm
MAITRE’D
Madison?
LISA

I’m not sure..

MAITRE’D
Could that be him?

He points to the restaurant floor below.

THEIR POV - ELEVATED SHOT

George slumped at a table his head in both hands in abject
worry.

LISA
I'll bet that is him..I’m having
that sort of day.

The maitre’d starts off to lead her to the table. .she makes a
gesture to stop him, not sure she wants to go through with
the evening...then the maitre’d turns toward her, leaving no
choice. She crosses to the table.

LISA
George? Are you George? I'm Lisa..

He stands up.

GEORGE
It's nice of you to join me.

small thing: he takes half a step to help her with her chair
and she is already in it.

LISA
So, how ya doing?
GEORGE
How are you doing?
LISA
I'm great.
GEORGE

Well, treasure it.
His head goes into his hand again.

LISA
You okay?

GEORGE

(realizing)
Sorry..I wasn’t even aware.. T have
to apologize this might not be a
great first impression. I’ve had a
really...

(small laugh)
“unusual” 24 hours.

LISA
{not wanting to get into
it)
Okay. Don’t worry about it. Is this
an Italian restaurant?

GEORGE
Yes.. A really good one.
29..26..30.
{seeing her confusion)
The Zagats rating.
(seeing her confusion)
Let’s get some drinks.

He gestures for the waiter.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 46.

LISA
Not for me.

GEORGE
I probably shouldn't have anything
either.
LISA

Well, don’t let me..

GEORGE
No. Drinking too much two nights in
a row could be a real mistake.

LISA
(now REALLY not wanting to
draw him out)
Uh-huh. I have not eaten since
lunch yesterday. .

She picks up the menu.

GEORGE
you don’t drink at all?
\
LISA
I follow my father’s rule on

drinking.

(to waiter)
Could I start out with one of those
little pizzas and, oh look at that,
you have spaghetti and meat balls..

WAITER
Kobe beef meatballs..it’s a
signature dish.

LISA
(cheering)
Outstanding!
(a glance at George who
seems to have momentarily
plunged into an emotional
abyss)
Plenty of garlic, please..and that
tomate and onion salad.

The waiter looks at George -- who cannot focus on ordering.

GEORGE
Oh..I/11..wait.
(to Lisa)
Which is?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 47.

She doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

GEORGE
Your father’s rule on drinking?

LISA
Never drink to feel better. Only
drink to feel EVEN better.

GEORGE
Pretty great.

LISA
(cutting him off)
Yeah, it's a good one.

GEORGE
But you know sometimes one drink
can give you a better perspective.

LISA
Well, I don't think so but maybe it
depends on the person. Look, have a
drink if you want.

GEORGE
(snapping)
f wasn’t looking for permission. If
I want to drink I know I can
just...

LISA
(an exclamation)
Jesus! You know I don’t know you.

GEORGE
(getting it)
Yeah. .I’m not good tonight. I’m
sorry. If you want I can explain
it. Maybe it’s good to talk about
it. I haven't really done that yet.

LISA

(like a shot over him)
No! I don’t think that’s a good
idea. Maybe what you need..I know I
do..is to somehow take the strain
out of this dinner. When you feel
yourself trying too hard at
something that should be simple you
know you're in trouble. You have to
wait till it’s natural.
47

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 48.

GEORGE
yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly..

He starts to vigorously rub his forehead.

LISA
What's wrong?

GEORGE
I'm just trying to figure out.. Is
everything you say that smart or
am I that desperate?

Her pizza comes.

LISA
Well, I’ve had a lifetime of great
coaches..

Even that small thought about her athletic life gives her a
flash of the creeps. She takes a quick cleansing breath.

LISA
So what I'm suggesting is that we
eat. Order something yourself
which, all by itself,will make me
more comfortable, and that we don’t
work at conversation. We cut
ourselves a break here and give
ourselves permission to be
quiet...for the whole
dinner. ..completely quiet.

He takes this in for a beat then:

GEORGE
Can I talk to the waiter?

George indicates he’s kidding, she smiles pack half-
heartedly.

LISA
As long as you don’t tell him about
your day.

He laughs..For a few seconds anyway he has enjoyed life.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 4g.

The two of them silently eating..every once in a while
catching each other’s awareness and making a gesture to
disengage that contact with a smile or little wave. But make
no mistake, even though one person is eating while the other
falls in love...there is no flirtation or charming subtext
going on. There is no subtext when two people are in this
kind of trouble, so Lisa’s rules suit them both for this hour
of their lives..hell, it may even be some solution to dating
in general, where someone warms your space while you are knee
deep in your own troubled thoughts; it may be some flawed kin
of early intimacy, though Lisa becomes so lost in her own
thoughts that she almost forgets George is there.

EXT. RESTAURANT - TWILIGHT (REMEMBER THEY ATE EARLY) 48

They each take a breath about to go back to their lives.

GEORGE
Thanks. In a strange way it was
relaxing.
LISA

Yeah. This could have been the
worst and it wasn’t. Thanks for

dinner.

GEORGE
Thanks too. It feels great meeting
you.

Dittle nods. She pats his arm or some such and walks off. He
digs hands in pockets and walks in the other direction.

Good evening, Mr. Madison. Taxi?

They stand curbside as Charles’ cell phone rings. He answers.

GEORGE
Just tell me. I’d rather use the
rest of the night processing the
information.

CHARLES
(to doorman)
I’m sorry..this is private.

The doorman is puzzled...usually his spot is in front of the
door...but he moves off. The coast is clear.

CHARLES

(into phone)
The board, under extraordinary,

INT. LISA’S APT. BLDG. - STAIRWELL - NIGHT 54

As Lisa decides there will be no stair nopping tonight. She
moves slowly up the stairs to her apartment..then catches
herself wearing her oppression physically and picks up the
pace a bit.

INT. LISA‘S APARTMENT - NIGHT 55

She arrives at her door and opens it. Sally looks up..Then
Lisa spote something which alarms all her senses.

LISA'S POV

On the computer table is a bouquet of flowers and 20 little
handwritten notes stuck to the side of the table..little
drawings on some of them, some in color.

SALLY
The girls needed to tell you how
they felt. Something, isn’t it?

LISA
The last time I saw anything like
this is when a kid in another high
school died and they left this
stuff at the scene of the accident.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 52.

SALLY
No. Don’t do the negative take!
Pull out the positive.

LISA
(this actually helps her)
Yeah. Okay. They care. They respect
what I’ve done. The flowers are
pretty. .good...thanks..

SALLY
Come on - head up. Do the right
body language and the spirit might
follow. .How about some straight
talk?

LISA
Sally...right now...

SALLY
Right now you have taken the blow
of your life. Very few people take
a hit like this at your age where
the thing they love most, that they
have given every possible moment to
from very early childhood, that
contains all the identity they ever
had or needed is suddenly gone..I’m
very sensitive to what you’re going
through. .

Sally's straight talk, usually balm for her fighting spirit,
is experienced by Lisa as daggers to the heart..she reacts
with tight horror to hearing the truth said out loud.

SALLY

(continued)
I have been through this myself and
with others. So we’re going to have
a little pajama party where you get
to talk it all out..this is a
fragile time. When it happened to
me I was lucky enough to have
someone with the sensitivity to
help me deal with this. Do you know
what you need most right now?

LISA
Yes.

SALLY
what?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 53.

LISA
Insensitivity. .

56 INT. MATTY'S APT. FRONT DOOR - CLOSE ON MATTY - NIGHT 56

He is scrolling through some text messages. There is an
urgent knock at the door.

MATTY
Who is it?

LISA
(muffled)
Lisa!

MATTY
(a beat then sincerely)
Could you narrow it down?

LISA
No kidding right now.

He realizes it's her and quickly opens the door.

~~ LISA
You're alone, right?

MATTY
Yeah. I was just working up the
night .

\ LISA
You want me to be here?

MATTY
! Yes, I do.

' LISA
' Ok. This is what I need. If in the
middle of the night I start erying
or shaking or get enormously upset
, 1 don't want you asking, “what's
wrong?” I want you to just ignore
it. Is that okay with you?

MATTY
Actually, it’s my preference.

And so she can finally relax. As they walk toward the bedroom
Matty repeats his budding conviction.

extended..very expensive suit.

TOWER
Hi. I'm Tower Endman. Hello,
Charles.

CHARLES:

This is my son, George. Good to be
in your hands.

TOWER
That's my favorite compliment.
Thank you. Why don’t you two come
in?

Charles starts to get up. George is thrown..the other two
walk several paces away so that George has to raise his voice
to be heard.

GEORGE
I think I should do this on my own.

Tower nods. Charles nonplussed as the other two move off.

First there's a little talk I have
to give so you'll understand my
requirements as to..

GEORGE
Excuse me. I did the due diligence
on you and there were just a few
facts not listed. Would it be okay
if I asked a few questions?

Tower, though uncomfortable losing absolute control, nods.

GEORGE
What was your class standing in law
school, as an undergraduate and
then again for the bar exam?

TOWER
(disbelief)
You want to know how I did in
college?

GEORGE
Yes. Please. I have everything from
the time you were a U.S. Attorney
on but not those.

TOWER
That's an inane question.

GEORGE
I don’t think so. I mean this is
the most important hire of my
career so naturally...

TOWER
(insulted/diminished/
defensive)
Hire?

GEORGE
(honestly)
I’m just trying to be thorough. I
mean, really, don’t I have to find
out if your pomposity is justified?

TOWER
I don't wish to be your lawyer.

Baltimore. He is connected.

} The elevator arrives.

61 INT. LAW OFFICE - ELEVATOR - DAY

There are seven or so men and women on board all evidently

lawyers.

CHARLES
Don’t I get a little say in the
choice when I'm willing to pay
anything.

This stops all the laywer’s conversation.

GEORGE
You were going to “help” not
pay..and is it right for a lawyer
to interview a potential defendant
and allow you, someone else
involved in the issues, to be
present at the first interview?

56.

The other lawyers - some nod “no”..some mumble “no” One older

lawyer reacts viscerally and shouts it.

INT. LAW OFFICE - DYLAN LAURIE’S OFFICE - DAY 62

This is the law office of DYLAN LAURIE (the older lawyer.}
Dylan is Irish... Juries and people in general love him.

I recall ete Vas only one “B” and
that had to do with being drunk in
class.

(George likes the answer)
I have an important question of my
own.

George treats his answer to the obvious unstated question as
if it were an oath uttered to Saint Peter.

GEORGE
I did nothing to exaggerate
earnings. To my knowledge, I did
not engage in any wrongdoings
involving payouts to falsify
income..nor anything else illegal
or even questionable.

DYLAN
No not that...Can you afford me?

GEORGE
The firm refuses to pay legal bills
But my father is willing to help.

DYLAN
You can't take money from your
father because of his position on
the board. It would look terrible.

This is a blow..though George attempts to cover it.

GEORGE
Oh..That makes sense. But the
company has frozen my options and
the stock itself has broken down..
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 58.

GEORGE (cont 'd)

so my net worth is... What would
the amount of your retainer be...

DYLAN
Well, young man, unfortunately we
stand at the gates of hell’s toll
booth. Three hundred thousand as a
retainer and another three in
escrow in the event the government
heads toward trial.

' GEORGE
I'm afraid I only have a bit more
than 80 thousand liquid.

They look at each other for many peats..Finally...

DYLAN
This is not a silence T break.

GEORGE
Alright. Maybe I can sell...

DYLAN
(with genuine sympathy)
Everything you can.

GEORGE
(accepting his fate)
Alright.

Lisa and Riva racing..with two other girls..Lisa wins by a
discernible gap. .Riva gecond..the win, though, has taken it’s

toll on Lisa...she is breathing heavily....she is furious
about something but cannot speak yet...she glares at Riva.

RIVA
What’s wrong?

LISA
You let me win!!

RIVA
I did not.

Lisa actually advances pugnaciously on Riva while the others
the others seek to cool things..ie.."Hey, guys. -come
on. .nothing’s wrong..”

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 s9.

LISA
(in Riva's face)
The one thing I ask is don’t treat
me differently and you do this..

RIVA
(firmly and loudly)
Hey, I did not!!!

LISA
I’m not faster than you. .how could
I win if you didn’t hold
back. .you’re always point four
better..point four petter..always,
always...

RIVA
I don't know. Maybe just because
this is just practice. I guess this
meant more to you.

The ring of truth is unmistakable. Lisa knows exactly what
she has just done and it is without precedent. She says her
sin aloud, almost unconsciously...

LISA
I embarrassed myself..
(then to Riva)
Sorry..So sorry, hon. Really..

A helpless gesture as she begins to walk away..The others
jhave seen her only as a champion of great class; so they find
her confession heart preaking..they go after her..she tries
to wave them off but they hang in..embracing Lisa as they
walk away from camera.

EXT. PARTY TERRACE - DRIZZLY NIGHT 64

Lisa, dressed for a night out, stands alone, underneath an
awning steadily beating with rain, as a large party takes
place inside. She looks sad, isolated and introspective. .all
brand new elements in her life. Behind her we see...

THE PARTY

There are about 15 of Matty’s teammates here with their gals
and would be gals; all of the players making well over a
million dollars a year. Matty ig on the food line. The player
next to him has his hand underneath his girl's shirt and is
rubbing her breast. She is turned on and rubs his crotch
some. Impressively they manage to continue loading their
plates.
65

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 60.

Matty considers this poor manners. He catches Lisa‘s eye as
she turns his way and forces the player to stop groping the
girl. The indignant player puts his hand back on her breast.
Matty takes it away and gestures toward Lisa. The girl now
puts the hand back on her breast. Matty accepts defeat.

EXT. PARTY TERRACE - NIGHT 65
As Matty, bearing two plates, joins Lisa.

MATTY
(to Lisa)

I apologize. I thought some of them
were bringing their wives and that
changes the behavior considerably.
Ramino had this maybe the best
barbecue anywhere flown in from
Houston special..I mean he bought
an extra first class seat 50 a
friend could fly it up...wait till
you taste it...

LISA
No hard feelings. You stay. I just
can’t do this now.

MATTY
Come on, there‘s Christian athletes
in the game room..we’ll eat with
them.

LISA

Are you interested at all in what
is going on in my life? You never
ask.

(catching her attitude)
Why am I being pissy? What I mean,
I guess, is that I think you should
finally know what's going on with
me.

He gestures she should go ahead. She does..first time she’s
said it and it doesn't feel good.

tosses the meal.

INT, MATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 67

As he finishes stacking some firewood and then presses a hand
remote control which lights the gas starter underneath.

LISA
I’m going to go to graduate school
at night..and, of course I have to
work a few jobs. I’ve got that
lined up. But, I've got this
problem with my attitude. .and what
I have to do is just get to the
place where I appreciate what the
game gave me and accept and even
embrace the obvious..that the time
comes for every athlete where...

MATTY
It won't come for me.

LISA
Your career will never end?

MATTY
(proud secret)
1‘m working on a knuckleball.

LISA
Okay. Thanks. Going home, Matty.

MATTY
Okay, this will help. f knew a real
good player once and the coach cut
him and he just felt impotent...you
are probably feeling whatever the
female version of that word is..

His strange remark snaps Lisa out of it...

LISA
It's the same word.

‘
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 62.

MATTY
Don’t let what's going on with you
make you give me a hard time.
That's not productive.

LISA
I’m not giving you a hard time.
It's the same word for women.

He stares at her - wondering whether she’s messing with him
and then decides to let it slide.

MATTY
Okay. The tie goes to the pretty
one..s0 it’s the same word and he
was feeling impotent just like you
may be feeling..so...

LISA
I don’t think that’s what I’m
feeling.
MATTY

Can I just finish my thought here?
Maybe it will help, maybe it won't
but I/m trying.

LISA
I'm sorry.

MATTY

It's okay. So his girl had a
cat..and he started to save all the
eat's shit.

(on her reaction)
A little trust...And every few days
or so he took a huge amount and
wrapped it in a different package --
like a gift or a magazine roll..or
something you ordered on line.
Every few days, for eight months,
he sent these cat turds to the guy
who cut him.

Lisa makes a gesture of appealing to the heavens for help.

MATTY
File it away. It worked for this
guy. -

LISA
And he stopped when his anger went
away?
68

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 63.

MATTY
Well, the cat died.
(she laughs briefly)
You feel better?
(she nods)
Great. I hated seeing you touching
bottom.

Lisa looks up with a jolt..shocked.

LISA
That was sweet.

MATTY
(weirded out)
Yeah, you're right.

INT, GEORGE’S NEW SECOND FLOOR APT - NIGHT 68

This is a humble abode..very small one bedroom where George
ig surrounded by boxes filled with copies of all documents
subpoenaed by the government..just a few key pieces of
furniture. On some built in book shelves are his possessions:
sheets, towels, some silverware and glasses. .The place does
have one real feature.. overly large windows which give us a
small view of a low middle income neighborhood.. George has
his laptop open working on evidentiary spread sheets.

CLOSE ON GEORGE

As anxiety grips him. He scratches at himself..gets up..the
key is to keep moving but where and for what? He eyes packed
liquor bottles on the floor..actually goes to the frig for a
celery stalk..but he stops himself with a suddenly powerful
voice.

GEORGE
No. .NOPE..Settled.

He reluctantly heeds the voice from nowhere and not drink. He
bites on the celery stalk. There is a knock on the door..

ANNIE'S VOICE
It’s me, boss.

He opens the door to Annie. She is carrying some wrapped home-
made food. As she walks toward the kitchen.

GEORGE
Ah, Annie.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 64.

ANNIE
Did you call that girl?

GEORGE
No. You've got to stop cooking for
me. It was enough you found this
place.

ANNIE
That was selfish. You dress up my
neighborhood.

She has put her packages on the counter and now goes to the
outer hall to pick up a few more packages. On his reaction:

ANNIE
Cooking relaxes me when I can't
sleep. Why don’t you just call her?

GEORGE
Honestly? Because my first
impression wasn’t great. I'd rather
be more myself when I see her
next...

ANNIE
What if someone beats you to her?

He’s stunned. The thought had never occurred to him..but he
has something of a strategy and he’s sticking to it.

GEORGE
Optimism is sanity for me right
now.

She marches over to his refrigerator and begins loading the
stuff in..Then she turns...her demeanor changing.

ANNIE
Look...I‘m in such a funny position
but I need to tell you something...
Just so I don’t feel creepy. I know
stuff about what happened at work...
I can't tell you what because of
the thing I signed but if you start
guessing..I can’t help it if my
face is an open book....and maybe I
ean give you one hint which. .

George goes out of body -- almost jumping across the room -~
this is a visceral, instinctive, reflexive, urgent action to
save what he holds dear.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 6s.

GEORGE
Stop! You can get in genuine
trouble..And just listening could
be serious wrongdoing on my part.

ANNIE

I haven't slept..it’s killing me --
this information. It’s like
someone's going to shoot you and I
can’t scream...

(she screams)
“WATCH OUT!”

(still screaming)
PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME. or
else I'll just tell you. I have to.

GEORGE
No!

ANNIE
For god's sake let me unburden.

GEORGE
You've got to understand what it's
like for me right now.
(he takes a shot)
Annie, picture a very angry ocean
gtorm and I’m on this very little

boat..
ANNIE
(touched by the image)
Obbhh. .
GEORGE

And miraculously this little boat
ig still afloat and that boat is
that I haven’t done anything wrong.
Like allowing you to tell me
something you are legally
constrained from revealing. Not
doing anything wrong is keeping me
afloat..If I lose that..I’m gone.
Don't rock the boat!

ANNIE
But I know something about the
boat.

GEORGE

Please, stop.
69

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 66.

ANNIE
It's a terrible boat. You have to
get out of the boat.

GEORGE
You have to respect me on
this..And, for what it’s worth, it
doesn’t matter. I think I’ve
guessed the same stuff you know.. I
think I know what you do.

This slows her. Then...

ANNIE
Nope..You couldn’t be functioning
if you knew the stuff I’m talking

I think I could. I think I am.

This is great of you..

EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT 69

EXT. BULLPEN - DAY 70

We see Matty on the bench...a game in progress on the other
side of the bullpen gate. The bullpen coach is focused on a
relief pitcher warming up...on the bench with Matty, who is
deep in thought, is a cute Japanese pitcher, TORI, and a
pitcher in his 30's - DOUG. Tori is eyeing the bullpen coach
and the girls in the stands alternately...he points to one
very pretty girl..and gestures to Doug..the girl looks
over..Tori makes eyes at the girl who smiles. He makes a hand
gesture indicating she should phone him..she is
confused...how could she know the number? He looks over --
acting involved in the warm up as the coach looks his
way..and then, the coast clear again, reaches under a towel.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 67.

INSERT

There is a long printout of his phone number again and again
on a perforated sheet and a sling shot..he tears off one of

the numbers..balls it, loads it and shoots it at the girl --
it goes down her blouse. Doug reacts to the shot.

DOUG
Legendary...
(noticing Matty’s
preoccupation)
You didn’t see it

MATTY
(shakes his head)
Hey, let me ask this, how do you
know when you're in love?

DOUG
Intriguing.

The coach eyes the field on a noise from the crowd.

COACH
Got him out...You can sit.

As the pitcher who had been warming up, RYAN, puts on his
jacket and joins the others on the bench.

RYAN
Well, I’ve got a way..whenever this
one thing happens I know I'm gone..
I‘1l tell you but it’s personal and
I don't want anyone making fun of
me for it.

This is a historically “getting down” bullpen moment as
Matty’s demeanor reflects.

MATTY
Go.

RYAN
Okay. I figure I’m in love with
someone when I wear condoms with
the other girls.

DOUG
Massive!

They take this in. Then:

Lisa is on the phone..

LISA
Yeah.. Well, I don’t want to hold
you. Have a great season, Riva.

let you go....I’m great. Yeah.
Stop..I‘m fine.

She picks up a big piece of cardboard which she has color
coded. It is titled “To Call Before Team Leaves.” There are
close to 40 names..in columns with boxes marked. Each name
has a thought of what to say. Riva is the last name. This is
not a good moment....Her phone rings.

INT. LISA’S APARTMENT - FOUR DAYS LATER 73

Sally sits with her as Lisa closes a third suitcase and packs
a fourth..Sally is shaking her head.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 69.

SALLY
This is such a mistake.

LISA
(through her teeth)
Overstepping alert.

SALLY
Nope. You don’t make important life
decisions when you are mush. It’s
too dangerous. You fight low self-
esteem you don’t give it the wheel.

Lisa is raw, passionate and emotional..game face extremis.
She actually pounds at herself during the following:

LISA
I get him. He gets me.

SALLY
He does not get you.

LISA
Yessss. He gets that I get him
which is, in fact, getting me.
I’m actually doing what you drilled
into me. “I am committing to the
win.” “Don’t wait for your ship to
dock, swim out to meet it.”

Sally remains enormously worried.

SALLY

But, every cute story you tell
about him has to do with his
selfishness. That is not going to
stay cute.

(quoting the advice she

often gave)
“Date up - not down...”

LISA
Matty is every guy I’ve ever
known...teammates, dormmates, boy
friends. I am packed here. So
either back the hell off coach or
do what you have always done for me
and help me pull out some damn
positives because I’m..

Lisa suddenly pauses. She has suffered some sort of emotional
hiccup; losing her full head of steam to a sudden and surging
vulnerability.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 70.

LISA
(softly/naked truth)
It feels weird fighting with you.

Sally moves quickly to embrace her.

SALLY
I'm sorry, honey. Positives! Hell,
the guy has a 94 mile an hour fast
ball and a 40 million dollar
contract. So go get him. I hope he
has some idea of how lucky he is.

Lisa takes this as an endorsement. She is moved and relieved.

LISA
Thanks.

But, as they break the coach looks around.

SALLY
But why are you taking this much
luggage?

Lisa feeling defensive, begins to lift her five pieces of
luggage. .She points at Sally as she quotes her.

LISA
The best thing you taught me,
“Don't do anything half-way unless
you're willing to be half-happy.”

SALLY
Okay, but what does that mean in
this context?

LISA
I sublet my apartment.

SALLY
(genuinely alarmed)
NO! You have no plan B. This is
hysteria.

Lisa gathers her many cases, opens the door, shifts the cases
to the hallway and stands there. She is pugnacious in an
attempt to conceal her own insecurities from herself.

LISA
T am sorry that you lack confidence
in me. But I still appreciate that
you have trained me to go full out.

She closes the door.

I‘m taking it.

CHARLES
Anger can be useful. Watch out for
the bitterness.

GEORGE
What is the news, Dad?

CHARLES
There are strong indications that
they are going to indict you. I’ve
cancelled everything I've got. I’m
dedicating myself to this.

GEORGE
Um...

That's all he can manage. He makes a helpless gesture then
pockets the phone and enters the building, going past the
doorman who, seeing him so stricken, smiles encouragement.

George enters..and stands there..a beat and Lisa enters. She
is carrying several bags of groceries. George is looking down

and doesn’t see her. She leans forward...then:

LISA

George looks up to see literally the girl of his dreams.

Uh, Really Good to see you...

79 INT, MATTY'S APARTMENT - DAY 79

As George helps her carry in the bags of groceries.. She
takes them and walks off-screen into the kitchen. He is so
stunned to have run into her that he doesn’t note the
surroundings or respond to verbal stimuli.

LISA’S VOICE
You don’t live in this building, do
you? Hello?...Did you leave?...are
you still here?

GEORGE
(coming around)
Yes. Absolutely. Here I am.

She appears wearing a quizzical expression. He tries smiling.
It comes off a bit weird.

LISA
Look, sorry if I can’t be
hospitable right now but I have

to...
GEORGE
Can I go first?
LISA
Huh?
GEORGE
I want to explain why I haven’t
called.
LISA

(actively confused)
I don’t understand.

GEORGE
I think I’ve made a really bad
assumption that we’ve been on the
same wave length..Well, I didn’t
mean to quite say that either. Did
you ever want to delete every
sentence you were saying even as
you were saying them?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 74.

LISA
No. Look, sorry I’m rushed but I’m
glad to have bumped into you
because I bit your head off when we
had dinner and I have a thing about
rudeness so I'm glad I get to...

The door opens and Matty enters.

MATTY
Lisa?

LISA
Hey. George, this is my boyfriend,
Matty.

George takes in the news. And damned if some protestant gene
pool doesn't have him treat the moment with some class.

GEORGE
Nice to meet you...

MATTY
(as if George is not
standing there)
Who is he?

LISA
You didn’t say, “hello.”

MATTY
Well, I think you should check with
me before you invite a guy over so
I‘m a little too pissed off to say,

“hello.”
(on her ferocious look)
Just a Little.

Lisa heads for the bedroom and summons Matty to follow.

LISA
Please.

He gives George a territorial look and then follows her.
ON GEORGE
As he overhears the brief conversation in the kitchen.

LISA’S VOICE
Why would I have to check with you?

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 75.

MATTY'S VOICE
You just want me to state the
obvious so you can act mad.

INT. MATTY'S APT. - BEDROOM - DAY 80

Where Lisa and Matty maneuver on the precipice of fatal
disagreement. Lisa forthright, Matty, a veteran of skirmishes
with women who feel wronged, doing the dance.

LISA
(puzzled)
There‘s an “obvious” reason why I
should check with you before
inviting someone who offered to
help carry our groceries?

MATTY
I didn’t know about the
groceries..maybe that changes
things. Yeah, I think it does.
Okay, good talk.

LISA
(simply)
No. I want to know the obvious
thing I’m missing.

MATTY
Okay..You want my foot in the trap?
I‘1l put it there.

LISA
There is no trap. Let's just show
up here. What obvious thing am I
missing?

MATTY
Okay. That this is my place!

Lisa did not see this coming. It takes the wind out of her.
They look at each other for several beats..as the moment
sinks in.

LISA
Oh, boy. So long, Matty.

She opens the closet door where we see she has been living
out of her suitcases..She empties her one small drawer.

Not that far.
(sudden confession)
Well, an hour..by bus. I don’t want

He lifts some of her bags..

Yeah, I guess.

As they begin to walk off, the apartment’s intercom phone
rings and the doorman steps inside to answer it as we
overhear a last word from George.

GEORGE
An hour ten maybe.

He puts the phone down and scurries back to the street. -.He
sees George is carrying the luggage. George catches the
doorman’s eye and breaks into a grin,then turns back to Lisa
to indicate the bus stop.. They stand at the bus stop not 10
yards away from the doorman.

He hangs up and looks on as the bus arrives.

Boy, so dead.

GEORGE
This is a new place. I'm not
totally moved in yet. Hey, you
hungry?

LISA
Lately, always. Why you asking, you

He opens the refrigerator where we see some 30 containers
showing great home made ziti, chicken pot pie. .puddings. .

Yes.

George's cell vibrates. He reads “Dad” then turns it off..

LISA
I’m not going to be great

GEORGE

Are you kidding? Even right now
this is the best conversation I've
had since the night we didn’t say a

You make your own chicken pot pie?

GEORGE
A friend. All the plates and
silverware are over there..

She goes past him and grabs some silverware and paper
napking..it feels “datey” to him..yup, "flying start.” Then
her phone rings, she crosses to where it lies on the floor,
unplugs it, checks whose calling, brightens despite herself
and answers.

LISA

Hey. .

(listens then)
It doesn’t matter where I am.

(disbelief)
You're going to yell at me? That‘s
it? That‘s why you called? Well..I
think..

There is a low battery beep. She looks down.

LISA
Wait a minute..you’re going to lose
me..

In the background George reacts to “you're going to lose me”
with a small fun “take” to himself. His mood has lightened
for the first time in months. Meanwhile, Lisa’s phone goes
dead. She stares at it.

LISA
Just as well..it wasn’t going to go
well from there. I think we need
some time to think..

A pause and then reluctantly she turns off the phone.

I will get Guinness. And I make a
great drink, if you want to try it.
It‘s not an idle remark. Really, I

do.

Okay.. I’11 try something. .Just not

Oh, what am I doing? “Stay honest
with yourself when you know you're
making a mistake and at least there
may be a takeaway.”

(to George)
I am going to get drunk because I
am too lame to stand the way I
feel.

Great choice.

He starts moving away.

He stops.

SHOT. A Mexican maid sees him acting out over another
unanswered call to Lisa as she irons one of his expensive
shirts on a pro pressing machine.

Shot. The man working with the terrace plants looks up from
his crouch and see a forlorn Matty hit his head against the
inside of the glass terrace door right above him, unmindful
of the gardener’s presence.

Shot. Matty standing still..another man in the shot..he is

he take it and gives Matty’s back an encouraging rub.

low slung canvas chair. Lisa crunches on her drink. Nobody is
bad drunk here...rather just right..speech is clear -- maybe
imperceptibly slow...it could pass for thoughtfulness. .

I don't know if I have what it
takes for that regular Plan B. I
don't ever..have never felt that
love like the guy is the whole
deal, or to be honest, the baby
thing..not that either. I'm just
good at this one thing..When girls
talk about how much in love they
are or how a baby is everything..

(a shamed, scared whisper)
I think they're pretending....And
now a little event I was worried
would never get here..I am going to
stop talking about myself. ..What
trouble are you in, George?

Simply put. I’m currently
unemployed. My girlfriend has
recently broken up with me. I will

We are in a large room with cubbies filled with men and women
primarily in their 20’s. We do not know what we are doing
here.

INT. OFFICE - CUBBY - DAY 94

Where a young attractive (though chunky) man works at his
computer. He is about to finish a bit of work when an
attractive female intern (whom he secretly pines for) comes
in and gives him a take-out lunch. She leaves without taking
any notice of him. He looks at his sandwich. Shit..they put
mayo on his sandwich. It is really annoying. He leaves frame.
Comes back with a kleenex and tries to wipe the mayo off the
bread. It is not a good decision..pieces of tissue cling to
the bread. He reacts with some good humor to having done
something moronic and leaves frame for a second and now comes
back with a paper towel..he wipes the bread and it falls
apart..He throws that slice of bread away and takes a messy
bite of the remaining sandwich..the mayo tastes pretty good.
Back to work. He hits his print key while wiping at his
mouth..THE CAMERA FOLLOWS A CORD FROM HIS COMPUTER TOA
PRINTER SITTING ON THE FLOOR.

As out comes a UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT CRIMINAL COMPLAINT:
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT VS GEORGE MADISON.

INT. MATTY'S APARTMENT - TERRACE - NIGHT 95

Another party...lap sitting. .beer..long wooden tables on the
terrace where men with very good hand eye are smashing hard
shelled crabs which are on brown paper. .very pretty dresses
are getting splattered with each swing, so it becomes a
repeated chain reaction..slam, crab juice splatter, dismayed
squeal from a girl...Tori, the Japanese pitcher who tossed
his phone number into the stands, is in the company of the
girl whose bodice received it..He is very nice..noting the
splattered dress on his girl, he covers her with a bib..She
rewards him with a kiss. Tori loves his crab meat. He tosses
a question to a strolling Matty.

TORI
Flown in?

MATTY
Driven..but from the best crab
house in Baltimore. That sauce with
beer it’s...

DOUG
Crazy.

MATTY
Anyone see Lisa?

RYAN
She was inside. By the way,
interesting woman. Beautiful guns.

He indicates upper arm muscles.

MATTY
(sincerely)
Thank you.

INT. MATTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 96

Matty moves inside and sees Lisa on the sofa - next to a
couple necking in good taste. She is about to get up and move
on when she spies the corner of a sport magazine. ..She grabs
it..instantly in a bit of a state.. Matty arrives.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 90.

LISA
Did you see this?

She flips to show him the cover..A headline reading “BEAUTY
AND THE BUDGET.“ And the visual is an arrestingly subtle but
brilliantly sexual photo of CAM, the girl who replaced Lisa
on the roster, wearing her USA uniform with tags hanging from
every garment detailing what amount corporate sponsors had
ponied up to be part of U.S.A. Softball. A tag line streamer
reads.."IF YOU SHAKE IT THEY WILL COME.”

MATTY
Who is she?

LISA
The girl who replaced me. They do
only her and she hasn’t even played
yet. What do you think?

MATTY
Gorgeous.

LISA
Thanks, that helps.

She gets up.

MATTY
Well, they have to market the
program.
(sotto)
You can't be pissed about it now,
you're the hostess.

LISA
Okay, okay..i am furious but not at

you.
She touches his arm, as in no hard feelings, then moves past
him to pick up her cell phone from a hall table.

drinks at a table for two.

Charles looks at his watch (one of the great watches)

As it clicks into a ring.

EXT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT BAR- NIGHT 101

George is just about to suck up the spirit to join his father
when his phone rings. He sees it is his father.

GEORGE
Hi, Dad. I’m just about to..

A call waiting tone and he looks at the face of his phone
which says, “LISA.”

GEORGE
Sorry. I can't talk right now..

CHARLES .
You need my help!

GEORGE
Might have to reschedule - sorry.

He hangs up. And hits another button.

takes a few steps, looks as if he will bump into George but
then turns to his parked car.

EXT.MATTY'S APT TERRACE/EXT.ELEGNT REST BAR: INTERCUT-NIGHLO3

Lisa is into her conversation with George. She is also
shivering a bit from the night wind.

LISA
A little crazy...I’m trying to
figure something out so, you're
smart so see what you....

GEORGE
I’m okay. Not smart smart.

LISA

Good enough. In a nutshell.. I’m
tempted to call my old coach and
unload on him. I did everything he
asked and now I know he bumped me
for someone because she is...

(veally hard to say)
better looking..some use the word
“gorgeous.” But I wanted to check
with a relatively clear headed
person before I..

ON GEORGE

Truly concerned on whether he meets the qualification.

GEORGE
I‘m not sure I’m clear headed when
it's you.

LISA
Please, stop being so....precise.

It's not about me. It’s about the
damn game. Just tell me what you
honestly think. Should I cream him?

GEORGE
Is it okay if I think about it for
a minute? Should I call you back?

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 93.

LISA
No. I'll wait. I can use the
breather.

There is a gust of wind and she audibly shivers.

GEORGE
What was that?

LISA
Nothing. I’m cold. I never was cold
before I went girlie. Hurry up and
think, okay?
EXT. NICELY LIGHTED BUS STOP - NIGHT 104

As George ponders the variables present in Lisa’s question
and considers the best advice.

Revealing that George's jocation is just a short distance
from Matty’s terrace as is made clear by something
architecturally distinctive.

EXT. MATTY’S APT/EXT. ELEGANT REST. BAR: INTERCUT - NIGHT 105
ON LISA

Agitated, as she paces in place, not knowing whether it's

good or bad for George to be taking time like this. Matty
strolls over.

MATTY

Who you talking to?
LISA

George. The guy you met.
MATTY

(carefully)

Uh-huh..... You going to be long?

LISA

I’m on hold sort of..

MATTY
You want privacy?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 94.

LISA
Well, I’m on the phone.
(George has resumed
talking)
Hi..So what do you think?

She listens as Matty monitors.

GEORGE
I’m not sure it fits you but for
me, and maybe it’s because my
father has always been such a hot
head, I don’t know. But a lot of
the time, I feel like I’ve really
accomplished something when I keep
a lid on. The minute you go off on
someone YOU MERES, all other options.
And, the worst thing for me these
days is how much is out of my
control. You understand?

LISA
Fantastically, yes.

GEORGE
So, I would want to keep all
options open.

ON Matty AND LISA

As he watches her hold one ear closed so she can listen hard
to George. Matty is about to say something but Lisa straining
to catch George’s words holds up her hand to stop him.

GEORGE
Well, that’s me. I wouldn’t eall
him, But these days, in particular,
I’m not a get it off your chest
person. Okay?

LISA
Okay. .thanks.
(double checking)
So, you're saying, don’t call him?

GEORGE
Yeah, I am.

LISA
Thanks. And look anytime I can
return the favor...well good, I
want you to remember that. It's why
I said it.

LISA (cont 'd)
(Matty is about to speak)
Got to go.

GEORGE
Nice talking to you.

LISA
Right. So long.

She clicks off..and looks to Matty to say his piece. She is
ready for a skirmish. But Matty fakes her out and goes high
road.

MATTY
You look cold. Would you like my
jacket?

LISA
(disarmed)
Okay, sure.

He puts his beautiful tan cashmere jacket on her shoulders.
As they walk back to the party-goers, we notice in the deep
shadows of the terrace, where Lisa was just standing, a
couple romantically engaged in active foreplay.

EXT. STREET - CAFE - DAY 106

Annie and George sitting at a cafe of some sort.

ANNIE

You have to see your father.
GEORGE:

Why?
ANNIE

He’s one of the few people willing
to talk to you.

George is silent.

Is he out?

DOORMAN
I'll check.

As he dials the house phone George fidgets.
DOORMAN
Your son is here to see you, Mr.

The doorman nods and George enters.

INT. MATTY AND CHARLES’ APT. - ELEVATOR - NIGHT 108

George combatting some enormous tension.

INT. MATTY AND CHARLES’ APT. BLDG. - HALLWAY - NIGHT 109

As he knocks on his father’s door... A housekeeper opens it
and, having been told to leave when George gets there,
carries her things with her so what follows between father
and son will take place in privacy...

INT. CHARLES’ APARTMENT - NIGHT 110
As he enters George takes a quick and enormous breath. He is
vibrant with conflicting emotions which makes even his first

word difficult to utter...

GEORGE
Dad.

Charles has a drink in his hand. He is glad to see him.

CHARLES
Finally..... Have you been avoiding
me?

GEORGE

Yes. Absolutely.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09

CHARLES
why?

GEORGE
(that quick)
Did you do it?

They are now looking at each other. Charles slowly
enunciating his words...

CHARLES
Did..I..?

GEORGE
Do it?

97.

Charles half laughs. George is focused, forceful, wound tight

so as not to shake.

GEORGE
So?!?

His father takes some stock as he sits down. They are now

quite close.

CHARLES
My gogh...you’re not asking. .

GEORGE

(pressing but calmly so)
Did you do something to fabricate
earnings for the analysts and
either knowingly or accidentally
put me in this spot? Did you do
that? And, if you did, are you
still looking, even at this moment,
for a way to handle it and me
without telling me that you
committed a criminal act?

CHARLES
Easy..easy. This ground we are on
is wall to wall mine fields.

GEORGE
Oh, for God’s sakes, you're a
goddamned crook..... Am I right?
CHARLES

Well, how about one question of my
own. Am I talking to my son or 4
recording device?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 98.

George lifts his father to his feet..and shakes him. .Charles
in trying to free himself actually slaps his son who doesn’t
even feel it. He pushes his father away and heads for the
door. His father calls out his concession.

CHARLES
Sorry I asked that. Awful.

GEORGE
(turning)
Do you have any idea whatsoever who
I am? How could you think...

CHARLES
You're right to be offended.

What exact Re you do?

CHARLES
If I did something and if I told
you I would be putting you ina
seriously, legally compromised
position. So will you let me
proceed carefully here?

GEORGE
No, I won't. Just...tell Me. Now.
What did you do, Dad?

CHARLES
I did what everyone who does
business in the Mid-East does..and
I mean everyone..as in
every...bodddy ...who is not
Microsoft or selling something
indispensable...You pay a toll in
the Mid-East no matter what the
country is. If you want to sell in
Egypt you go there, rent an office
and bribe an Egyptian. That’s what
I did.... like Every...bodddddy
does. I bribed the Egyptian. They
put money on our books with an
order knowing I would slip the
money back to them.

George makes a sound.

CHARLES
(continued)
The stock moved more than I
-o thought. It attracted attention.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 99.

CHARLES (cont 'd)
I didn’t think it would ever touch
you..and I wish I could somehow
express how what is happening to
you is the most wrenching
experience of my life. And it’s not
just emotional.

(telling his truth)

It‘s physical. It hurts in a
profound and deep way..my muscles,
my skin..like those side effects I
got from Lipitor. I am anguishing
in every way because of what you
are going th.....

Charles voice cracks..he is about to ecry.. A fact which is
more than George can take. He wigs out -- moving his face
close to his father as he speaks with loud urgency.

GEORGE
(sputtering poetically)
Stop. You damned narcissist..No you
don't.. You can’t cry. You ethical
mutant. .

George is breathing a bit heavily never having come close to
talking to his father like this. Charles wipes his eyes and
meets his son’s gaze and gives him some fatherly advice that
is delivered with strange calm and intimacy.

CHARLES
Better pace yourself, son. It gets
worse.
As George reacts.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. MATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 111

Matty is working his phone with a pleasant frenzy. His bags
packed and standing. He is about to leave for a road trip.
Lisa calls from the next room.

LISA
(o.c.)
I'm going to miss you.

He smiles at a message he just received and taps out an
answer.

MATTY
Echo that. What are you going to do
with yourself?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09

LISA
Coach the rich twins..maybe hang
out with George a little. I’m
seeing him later.

He sends off his reply.

MATTY
What?!?

LISA
No worries. It’s always athletes
for me. And, the team is training
in town and..I dunno..I was
thinking of dropping by. The only
thing is...

100.

But Matty is distracted as a tone signals a reply to his
reply which makes him laugh a little so that, as he continues
to read, he does not sense Lisa’s presence when she enters

to see him enjoying the text..

LISA
Matty?

He immediately disengages the phone, his attitude very caught

in the cookie jar.

LISA
We need to talk for a second.

MATTY
I'll call you from the car.

LISA
Are we monogamous?

MATTY
You're feeling this way because of
the road trip. But we don‘t have
the time to do this.

LISA
How much time does it take to
answer?

MATTY
The answer is, yes, of course,
essentially.

(on her look)
That’s the truth. And my rule
because I love you, is to always
tell you the truth.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 101.

LISA
You love me?

MATTY
I've told you that.

LISA
No, you haven't.

MATTY
Well, I told the whole bullpen.

LISA
What’s “essentially?”

MATTY
I am not anything like the wild man
I used to be. If it bothers you, I
will attempt to cut out even the
anonymous sex. .

{before she can speak)
BECAUSE..I think we may be heading
for the biggest result that can
happen to a dating couple.

LISA
Oh, Jesus, you stinker.

MATTY
A guy is willing to go one thousand
miles for you and you criticize him
because he ‘ADMITTEDLY’ hasn’t
covered the last yard yet.

Lisa has had the wind knocked out of her. This goes
deep..shivering legs, a flash of some prescient terror, the
whole deal..She is briefly helpless to do anything but sort
of hold herself and take stock. She is stunned by her own
sense of internal devastation.

LISA
Um. .Whew..does this feel like shit.
Boy! So this is what everybody is
always talking about.

She takes a breath...her freshly oxygenated brain kicks in.

LISA
You have to get the team bus. You
don't miss the team bus no matter
what. We'll talk. I'm moving out.
But we’1l talk.
112

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 102.

MATTY
Don’t break up with me.

LISA
Well, that’s the thing, I don’t
know if what we have is even
anything breakable.

MATTY
Where you gonna go?

LISA
Well, I'm in luck because my
tenants hate my place - they’ve
been trying to get out of the deal.
(emphatically)

Don’t miss your team bus! We'll
talk this out when you get back.
You can't miss a team bus!!!

MATTY
Okay, I decided. I’m going to be
monogamous while I’m away. You too?
She nods -- it is the furthest thing from her mind.
MATTY
(continued)
This will be okay.

LISA
Go!

He cups her face..her eyes glisten..He means what he says
next but, still, he is also consciously playing his “A” game.

MATTY
Why do women always look best just
as they are shifting away from you?
He gives her a light kiss.

LISA
Oh, stop it! Jesus.

She shoves him toward the door.

INT. CHARLES APARTMENT - NIGHT 112

George is slumped in a cushy chair, virtually
asleep....Charles is on the phone in the next room.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 103.

CHARLES
(into phone)
Well, I’m going to possibly go into
all the ramifications with my son.
Then I can meet with you and the
other lawyers..Okay, then.

He hangs up and enters. He nudges George.

GEORGE
Weird. Never felt this tired.

CHARLES
Take my advice. I think you should
get away from me. Cut me off. I’ve
just been trying to avoid an
inevitable here. Have to give up on
that. I tried to steer you to the
right lawyer. Your guy was wrong. I
could have paid your bills - used
money to make the government lose
heart in a minor matter. But, no,
you picked a shmoe.

GEORGE
I just work better with facts. Just
tell me.

CHARLES

George, I worked for a boiler stock
operation when I was 19. There was
a violation and I got one year
probation.

GEORGE
Why are you bringing that up now?

Charles is reluctant to continue.

GEORGE
Go.

CHARLES
Because of that if they find me at
all responsible for the current
problems I would be a repeat
offender and could get 25 years in
jail...that’s why I didn’t come
forward.

They look at each other...that fact produces a genuine,
though brief, transcendent moment. In a fleeting gesture
George touches his father’s arm in sympathy.

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 104,

GEORGE
Wow Dad, what are we going to do
here?

CHARLES

Finally and at last not your
problem. I need you to go because I
am in some wrestling match with
myself here. I can’t trust myself
not to manipulate you - I don't
know if I’m doing it now.

(gives it some thought}
I think I am.

GEORGE
Has it occurred to you, as a
possibility, that you can just say
what happened..without trying to
control the outcome?

CHARLES
Honestly, no.

George gestures that it is worth a shot.
CHARLES
If you pled out the sentence would
be three years with a chance of
getting it down to less than two..

GEORGE
And you’d....

CHARLES
Get off. Maybe. Probably.

George feels a sudden thrust of energy. -

GEORGE
That's everything?

Charles nods.
GEORGE

Okay. I think this was a good
visit.

know as PARTICULARLY EMOTIONAL GIRL) hits a home run and wins
the game. .some photographers shoves the home run hitter out
of the way to take pictures of Cam, who was on base at the

Gnawing on her lip in anxiety. She is actually considering
leaving before anyone sees her.

BACK TO THE ACTION

As the teams lines up to shake hands..Riva hurries through
the line spots Lisa and dashes up the hill...at least half
her teammates join her...including the home run hitter.

ON LISA
Even as she shouts an admonishment...

LISA
Did you even finish shaking hands
with the other team? Coach’11 blame
me.

But, here come the hugs and oh, God she loves them -- Even as
she experiences the rush of being with them, she is working
her ass off to appear light-hearted. She puts her face close
to the beefy girl.

LISA
Look at you..Little Miss Home Run

As Riva and Lisa sit on the grass together, having a beer.
The vibe is clearly intimate. They look down on the well-lit
playing field...

RIVA.
You're doing okay. Your making the
adjustment. Give it time. Maybe
grad school and odd jobs aren't the
right thing. Anybody would want you
as an assistant coach.

LISA
I have to wade? that one.

RIVA
Till what?

LISA
Till I won't envy my players.

RIVA
Holy shit, Lise.. This isn’t you.

LISA

I hope not. Don’t tell anyone I'm
this bad, or did I show it?

(genuinely alarmed)
Does everybody see it.. Is it
leaking out of me? And all of this
whining I do serves nothing ...like
my mother said to me when she was
sick, “you can’t cry and fix
something at the same time.”

(dabs at her eyes)
Now I'm going to feel sorry for
myself for losing my mother. Just
wallow, wallow, wallow.

Riva moves closer to put her arm around Lisa, who immediately
shifts away, waving it off, not feeling deserving of
comforting. And then, instead, grabs her friends two hands in
an attempt to give instead of take.

LISA
(continued)
Listen to me, Riva, ‘cause this is
my gift to you for putting up with
me tonight. Stay ‘till they tear
you away, honey.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - NIGHT 115

To see Lisa in a very underpopulated commuter train car. She
simply must find surcease.

INT. GEORGE'S APT. - NIGHT 116

As he sits at his computer trying to write a letter. It is a
warm night and his large window is open at his elbow. We move
in on his computer..but just as we begin to read he hits the
delete key sweeping away two paragraphs and leaving just,
“Dear Dad." His phone rings. He mishits the phone as he
answers.

GEORGE
Hello.

Even though he has yet to engage the phone he vaguely hears
Lisa.

LISA‘S VOICE
Hello?

He hits the right phone key.
LISA
Hi.

Puzzled now by having seemingly heard Lisa's distant voice
without benefit of a phone connection. He leans out his
window.

HIS POV

Lisa standing beneath his window..phone in hand. She is
working real hard at being the casual, immediate,
uncomplicated girl she was so recently. But in this time of
distress it is just faux real folk.

LISA
How you doing?

GEORGE
Good. You okay?

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 108.

LISA
Uh-huh. Sure am. Hope it‘s not too
late to call.

She turns around and looks up at the window..he leans away
from the window.

GEORGE
No. What's going on?

LISA
Nothing. Just that we made
indefinite plans to hang out and I
was trying to nail them
down..schedule my week.

GEORGE
Well, anytime, though soon would be
advisable.

LISA

(snorting at the
preposterous thought)
I guess it’s too late for tonight.

GEORGE
No. Not at all. I am waiting for a
call from my friend if she has her
baby tonight..but we can deal with
that if it happens.

LISA
Okay. Well, what the heck. Let’s
take a shot. I can be there
in...less than a half hour.

GEORGE
Good.

LISA
This time of night it could be
faster.

Good. I hope so.

Huh?
LISA

Because I’m nuts and I seem to be
going around dumping this nutty
person on every nice person T know.
I was downstairs when I called you.

GEORGE
I know.
LISA
And you weren't going to say
anything?
GEORGE
No.
LISA
Why not?
GEORGE

I just didn’t want to...

Embarrass me?

You look good. You look rested. But
everyone looks rested to me.
George, help me out.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 110.

He stands poised to do anything.

GEORGE

LISA
I can’t stop griping. You're the
one who said it. “Did you ever want
to delete everything you said just
as you finished saying it?” And I
thought that was the strangest
thing and lately I hear myself
being so weak, and whiny and needy
that I wish I could dele...

George quite suddenly clamps a hand over her mouth..She is
surprised..feels a little violated, in fact..the observant
will note that she actually has made a fist.

CLOSE ON LISA'S EYES

As they appear over George’s hand and she tries to make sense
of the situation.

GEORGE
I think the answer to what you’re
talking about is to stop talking.
Just deny a voice to the thing that
is falling apart. No lip service.
That's my advice. Which I think I
got from you. Sorry to handle you
and the situation like this but it
was an impulse. I’m letting go now.
(noticing the fist)
Don't hit me.

ON LISA‘S EYES

As they reflect understanding and gratitude just before he
releases her...She takes a breath..touches him lightly in
gratitude and moves away to sit down. The phone rings.

GEORGE
{into phone)
Hey. Really...how much? How do you
feel?...Yeah sure..now..can I bring
a friend? See you soon.

He hangs up.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 111.

GEORGE
(to Lisa)
She had the baby. I’m going over.
You want to come?

LISA
No. I’d be in the way and..
(she stops herself/mock
stronger)
Sure. Okay. Thanks.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 119

As George and Lisa sit in Annie’s hospital room..Her parents
are just leaving. Annie has a sleeping baby in her arms..and
is trying to hostess the coming and going..

ANNIE
Hey, boss..Look what I found. .
{to Lisa)
And you’ re?

LISA
Lisa.

ANNIE
(enormously pleased)
Wow. Mom..Dad..that’s boss and..

GEORGE
George Madison.

MOM
Good to see you, George.. Lisa..
Annie has told us about you both.

Lisa is mystified. As they turn to wave to Annie..

ANNIE
Thanks guys and remember Dad there
are lotsa of tv shows with single
mom heroines.

DAD
I'm fine. It's fine. Everybody's
healthy. That‘s it.
(to Lisa)
Yhat's it, right?

Lisa is mystified.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09

LISA
Yes, sir.
They exit.
ANNIE
It’s killing him..
(to Lisa)

Nice to meet you finally.
Lisa is distracted by the size of the baby.

LISA
Gee whiz.

ANNIE
(proudly)
10 pounds 10. And I'm three days
early.

LISA
You exhausted?

ANNIE
Oh..I’m slap happy.

GEORGE
World's luckiest baby.

ANNIE
(pointedly to Lisa)
Leave it to boss to say the great
thing.

The phone rings.

ANNIE

(into phone)
Hello..You're here? Fourth floor.
Oh well, then just ask for Double
Didget’s room. That’s what we're
all calling him for now.

(sheepishly to her baby)
Your dad is here.

112.

George and Lisa smile and start to go. Lisa lingers for a
second to peek at the baby..they turn and George turns to see
his father enter the room. This Chinatown moment is immediate
and visceral --- George speaks in the hushed tone of the

broken.

GEORGE
No. .NO.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 113.

Lisa glances up. George is on the verge of a seizure as
Charles is nudged out the room's doorway by a heavyset man
carrying flowers and an old model video camera..His name is
AL.

GEORGE
{quickly transitioning to
Al)
Hi. Congratulations on the birth of
your baby.

Al leans forward and hugs Annie, kisses the baby on the head.

ANNIE
(to Charles)

It was very nice for you to come
by, Mr. Madison.

CHARLES
Just wanted to drop this off..Tell
you not to worry about your job in

any way.

ANNIE
Well, that’s oh-my-God great to
hear.

Charles, having scored his point, looks around.

CHARLES
(to George)
You okay?

GEORGE
Tops.

CHARLES
Thought you might be here. Would
you like to talk - go over
anything..Any new thoughts?

GEORGE
No. Not yet.

CHARLES
You're thinking things out.

GEORGE
Not at this precise moment. I’m on
a break.

 
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 114.

CHARLES
There's a time factor that I can no
longer shield you from.
(noticing Lisa)
You a relative of Annie’s?

LISA
I'm a friend of George. Lisa.

Charles eyes her more closely and extends his hand.

CHARLES

Good to meet you. Call me Charles.
LISA

Okay.
CHARLES

I spoke to George minutes after he
met you for the first time.

Lisa is mystified.

LISA
No kidding.

CHARLES
Yes..So I was the first to know.

Lisa is mystified.

LISA
Outstanding.

CHARLES
I'm his father.

LISA
Oh. Good to see you.

CHARLES
That's nice of you to say. Okay,
all..I Love you, son. Goodnight
everyone.

Charles exits. George is still coming down from what he
briefly thought.

ANNIE

(to George)
Boss, when he walked in..You didn’t
think?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 115.

George concedes that he did with a look.

ANNIE
You poor guy.

Al and Lisa exchange greetings. Al is flushed with visceral
pleasure. Annie looks over at him...eye contact that contains
the d.n.a. of all that is good and produces huge grins.

ON AL

The moment of his life is upon him. He walks over to George
and whispers as he hands him his video camera.

Hey?! I'm SHORE). do something
record it..Red button.

(he sits on the bed facing

the mother of his child)
I got to say something..to you. For
christ's sake to the two of you. I
don’t want you to think the reason
we aren’t married is because I
think anyone else is anything. It’s
because I am 47 and a failure.

ANNIE
I’11 kill you - you talk like that.

During this exchange Lisa feels she is somehow violating
their privacy and is trying to make her getaway but she can’t
get George’s attention. Nonetheless she decides to exit and
walks to the door.

AL
I’1l get work I guess..but no
seniority anymore or...but don’t
get me sidetracked. The reason I
didn’t talk marriage is I couldn’t
stand to see you -- the princess of
worry -- weighted down by me and my
limited prospects.

And now he has Lisa’s attention. She pauses at the door.

AL
Because I get your worry. And
people could think that’s the bad
thing about you but I get that it’s
because of your great heart..and I
love you for it.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 116.

AL (cont'd)
And then I worried about what would
happen to you - and now the little

hulk - if you ended up with someone
who thought your worry was --

ANNIE
Neurotic?

AL
Yes. Someone who didn’t get
you..who made you feel bad about
yourself..who wanted you to be more
normal..who wanted you to like
yourself more. Who wanted you to
change. Who didn’t love all of it.
Who wouldn’t leave great enough
alone. And, -- I didn’t sleep,
man...I thought I can do that for
you...and that was a legitimate
function for me in your life.

Annie cheers as if at a ballgame.

AL
And that allows me to propose to
you that we get married.

Annie blubbers. Al is emotional. Lisa is rapt. Al hugs
Annie..Lisa and George applaud as Annie and Al have a brief
and intimate exchange.

ANNIE
You‘re not scared anymore.

AL
I am. But scared is a step up from
terror and terror is what I feel
about losing you.

Annie gasps. Al holds her in this, their quintessential
moment. Al looks at George and says through tear glazed eyes.

AL
Did you get it?

GEORGE
(stricken)
Oh my God..I just got caught up
with what you were saying. .

AL
(this can’t have happened)
You didn’t get it?
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 117.

GEORGE
No.

Annie has missed this exchange due to being blissed out.

Al
He didn’t get it.

ANNIE
(stricken)
He didn’t get it????

GEORGE
I can’t tell you how...

LISA
(driving force)
Come on..right away - let‘s do it
again. Just do it now..go ahead,
Al. We'll record it.

Al is willing but there is a problem.

AL
Who knows what I said?

GEORGE
I. sure do..

LISA
Let's just think and piece this
together right away..

Everyone is wiping tears away as they agree to try. Al gets
to his initial position when he said his piece. George, as
deliberately as possible, pushes the record switch. What
follows is very informal..some improvs called for; people
talking on top of one another..this group exercise is marked
by great spirit and enormous light heartedness. .but still
real dedication to the task at hand..recreating the proposal.

ON AL
As he takes his highly self-conscious shot.
AL
I didn't want you to think that the
reason I didn't ask to get married
was because I ever had a thought of
anyone else...

He’s stuck.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 118.

GEORGE
(to Al)
You said it was because you had no
prospects. You used the word
“failure.”

AL
(to Annie)
It's because I don’t want to saddle
you with a 47 year old failure.

Lisa comes in quickly.

LISA
Annie..”I‘11 kill you if..”

ANNIE
{laughing)
Thanks. “I’11 kill you if you talk
like that.”

GEORGE
Then you said that you didn’t want
her to end up with ..

ANNIE
Someone who wanted her to change
what she couldn’t change..

Annie’s line grounds things. The laughter stops---the import
and dignity return -

ANNIE
(cont ‘ d)
Someone who didn’t get me.

GEORGE
There was that whole list.

LISA
(primarily to Annie)

He was worried that you’d be with
someone who made you feel bad about
yourself...who wanted you to like
yourself in a different way. Who
wanted you to change. Who didn’t
love all of you.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 119.

GEORGE
(primarily to Al}
You said that protecting her from
that - appreciating her the way you
do..was a legitimate function for
you in her life.

AL
Wow. I said that?

ANNIE
I feel like you're all proposing to
me.

AL

And then I asked you to marry me.

LISA
No, no, no! What you said was...
(enunciating very
carefully)
*I propose to you that we get
married.”

ANNIE
And you called him, “little hulk,”
which, I don’t know why, is my
favorite thing. I love you so much,
Al. Thanks everybody.
{to George)
I think we have it.

He stops recording. She holds her arms out and gives him a
hug.

ANNIE
I'm so worried about you.

GEORGE
Please don’t.

AL
Let her be.

George nods..claps Al on the back. Lisa approaches Annie and
has to laugh even as she says the nuclear understatement.

LISA
Well, it was nice meeting you.

They hug. Annie laughs as well.
120

121

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 120.

ANNIE
Nice meeting you too. I love you.

And that cracks them up because, like they say, “it’s funny
because it’s true.”

LISA
(helplessly)
Me too.

George is truly digging Lisa. And now the awkwardness as they
nod and exit.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 120

The awful thing is the sharp change in their ethos. A second
ago they seemed a couple..and now, that quickly, much like
Double Digit so recently experienced, they are thrust from
that warm, safe, womb like space into the awkward starkness
of the real world. There is considerable culture shock as
they walk toward the exit of the hospital self-consciously,
the space between them as they walk widening in small
increments.

EXT. HOSPITAL - BUS STOP - NIGHT 121

As they exit - (some horrible but legit sign about heaith
insurance regulations in the background.) It’s a warm night,
light breeze blowing, streetlights providing just the right
light and each of them still looking for a proper punctuation
to the recent experience. A small but persistent shyness has
come into their atmosphere.

LISA
Thanks...

She is surprised that the word comes out with difficulty ..
She is still a bit choked up. She laughs slightly and gives
it another go. There is an unmistakable shyness.

LISA
Thanks for the soul food. I'11 just
catch my bus over there?

GEORGE
I‘1l wait with you.

LISA
{softly)
Okay, good. Thanks.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 121.

And then, with such ill timing that they each take it in with
a bit of horror, the bus turns the corner. Lisa shrugs. And
then, as she boards the bus, notes that George already has
his back to her and is walking away. As the bus starts up.

ON GEORGE

So sullen at being cheated out of his moment with Lisa that
an outburst escapes him just as Lisa, aboard the bus, passes
unnoticed in the background.

GEORGE
{to the heavens)
I can't catch a break!
FULL SHOT - THE STREET

As George continues to walk and sees that Lisa has gotten off
the bus at the next street. She jogs his way.

GEORGE

What?

LISA
What? I saw you..shouting and all
crazy.

GEORGE
No. Just weird that you were off
that fast.

LISA

Well, I can wait for the next bus.
You just charged away.

GEORGE
Yeah. Okay.

Looking up the deserted street.
GEORGE
Well, I think we'll have some time
now. Won’t....

Another bus appears...

LISA
What is this?

GEORGE
I think it’s the opposite of a bus
strike.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09

She nods with a half smile -- it was sort of clever
let it pass.

GEORGE
(continued)
Won’t Matty be worried?

LISA
Ummm. I didn’t tell you we’re not
living together right now? I
thought I did.

GEORGE
No. I would have remembered.

122.

. As they

The bus stops near them. The driver steps out and lights a

cigarette. The bus’ sign shows a change of route

DRIVER
You’ve got till I finish this.

GEORGE
Okay. Thanks.

GEORGE
(to Lisa}
Go ahead. .Matty?

LISA
We're still working on it froma
different slant..he gets back
tomorrow. He’s throwing me a
belated birthday party tomorrow
night. Going all out. Not my choice
but when you're in something you’ve
got to give it everything you have.

GEORGE
Makes sense. Am I invited?

LISA
(totally thrown)
Sure..but it’s a very testosterony
group.

GEORGE
Se I am invited?

LISA
Sure. What are you talking about?
Of course.
122

123

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 123.

The driver tosses his cigarette and reboards the bus as Lisa
starts to follow him.

GEORGE
When is your birthday?

LISA
Tonight...

She leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.

INT. GEORGE'S APT. - NIGHT 122

As he enters propelled by the confusion flying away from his
mind and spirit. One shouted word...

GEORGE
Clarity!

He goes to the table near the ever open window where we
briefly see and read bits of the worksheets (reading REASONS
FOR AND REASONS AGAINST...The top line on one, “fT don’t want
to go to jail.” On the other, “I don’t want my father to
spend the rest of his life in jail.”) He crumples the sheets,
tosses them and speed dials his father who answers before one
ring is finished.

INTERCUT BETWEEN

INT. CHARLES’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 123

GEORGE

indication.

GEORGE
Tomorrow.

CHARLES
George, I...
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 124.

GEORGE
I know. You love me. I love you
too. Tomorrow.

124 EXT. CHARLES AND MATTY‘S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 124

UPBEAT MUSIC as George approaches. . she has worked on his
look..best suit, tie etc. He looks great. In front of the
pbuilding, a card table has peen set up manned by two of the
ballplayers we have previously seen at the parties. They are
in the process of very reluctantly denying admission to two
gorgeous girls.

GORGEOUS GIRL
Why text us if you’re not going to
let us in?

BALL PLAYER
Because I didn’t know Matty wasn’t
going to allow fun.

GORGEOUS GIRL
Well, don't ever invite us again to
anything. I feel degraded.

BALL PLAYER
Okay...I’m sorry, I'll give you
three hundred dollars and my phone
number .

GORGEOUS GIRL
Alright.

George enters in the background.

DOORMAN
Going to the party, George.

GEORGE
Not yet.
125 INT. CHARLES APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 125
George knocks on his father’s door. Charles answers it.
CHARLES
(tense)

Hi, son. Just a minute, my lawyers
were just leaving.
126

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 125.

And so they begin to file out...endlessly..maybe 20 of
them..we don't wait for the last to appear.

INT. MATTY’S WALK IN CLOSET - NIGHT 126

We hear him telling Lisa, off-camera, how great it is to see
her as he leads her toward us. He is carrying a garbage bag --
some of the following speech is off-camera.

MATTY
I haven’t gone without a woman so
long since I had mono in high
school but it felt -- well you saw
the box scores, three one inning
stints, three up, three down, top
five player of the month talk..

He goes to the tooth brush @rawer and dumps them in the bag,
he goes to the sweat outfit drawer and begins dumping them.

LISA
You're not going to throw them
away?

MATTY
Yeah. It's a statement.

LISA
Give them to a hospital or
something.

MANNA

Great idea. The clubhouse guy will
take care of it. And no unattached
women allowed tonight..One guy is

bringing his sister. .Now.

He sits her down in his “valet chair." The kind with a
mahogany wooden hanger, little wooden dish for cuff links,
and little cane seat.

MATTY
I get to give you a gift.

She eyes him -- churning. There is a paper Tiffany bag
suddenly in evidence. This is clearly an important moment
coming up..some flower strewn crossroads..she is gripped by a
tightness which she hopes is excitement but might be terror.
There seems to be only one course open to her and she takes
it.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 126.

LISA
I have to pee.

127 INT. CHARLES APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT 127
Charles sits and indicates the chair for George.

GEORGE
No, thanks. I have to get
someplace.

CHARLES
You look ...

GEORGE
Great? I'm shooting for great
tonight. Okay..I know you want the
bottom line but do you care about
my reasoning?

CHARLES
(wisely lying)
Yes, of course.

GEORGE
First thing..and it was an all
nighter to get there..you know,
same as in anything the answer
starts with asking the right
question..And the question here
wasn't whether I go to jail or you
do?

CHARLES
It wasn’t?

GEORGE
No. The question was will I go to
jail for three years..or live for
25 years feeling awful because of
your being in jail.

CHARLES
(sincerely)
Very good.

GEORGE
I went over different scenarios to
get varying perspectives. If I had
Children I wouldn’t consider going
to jail.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 127.

CHARLES
But you don't.

GEORGE
Right. Or, if I had someone crucial
to the life I want for myself; it
would be perverse - some
denunciation of the experience of
life itself, if I gave that up.

Charles prepares to take some very rough medicine.

CHARLES
Well, that's an extreme point of
view..Do you have such a person?

GEORGE
T.....- don’t ......- know.
I am going downstairs and somehow
find out. There’s a party. She’s
there. There’s another guy.

CHARLES
You mean she may be unavailable?

Just the words kills him. Robs him briefly of his exuberance.

GEORGE
(mumbling)
Tean‘ thinkthatwayrightnowthendon't.

CHARLES
What?

George tries to think of his thought..and does.

GEORGE
I can’t think that way right now.
‘Cause I’m going down there and
take my shot..If I don’t have a
chance with her I‘1l1 go to jail for
you, Dad..But if I have any chance
at ali, I can’t..

(takes an excited breath)

Wish me luck.

And so he exits.
CHARLES

(wanly)
Good luck.

INT. MATTY’S APT. - WALK IN CLOSET - NIGHT 128

As Matty arranges a small Tiffany’s paper bag on the floor
near the valet chair. Lisa enters from the toilet. Matty
indicates she should sit in the chair again. He picks up the
small bag and waves it...then suddenly realizes the
impression he is giving; which might have screwed up
everything which would make him a moron. He quickly blurts
out a key fact to avoid crushing Lisa with disappointment.

MATTY
It’s not a ring.
(on her reaction)
Well, you don’t have to look so
relieved.

She smooches him on the head, patching his ego leak. Now she
sits.

MATTY
Okay. Maybe I don't get on a knee
for this but...

He bows more like a curtsey. It is sweet. She is touched.
Matty takes a breath; scaling a great mountain with great
uncertainty as to the purpose. He takes out a box and hands
it to her..She starts to unwrap it carefully.

MATTY
Come on, not so slow.

He actually starts to rip at it..She joins him in a shared
light moment and looks inside.

LISA
Whoa, whoa, whoa..It's gorgeous.
But...it’s gorgeous.

MATTY
But what?

LISA
Just thinking about when I would
wear it.

MATTY
I‘ll take you places.

She now removes an eleven thousand dollar watch circled in
diamonds.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 129.

-~
MATTY
Do you not get the meaning?
LISA
(no idea whatsoever)
Um..that time is..what? That it‘s
our time to have a new kind of time
that..
MATTY
(gravely)
It means that we’re engaged to be
engaged.
Lisa looks on the back of the watch.
MATTY
It doesn’t say it. You just know
it..my father gave my mother a
watch and four years later they
were engaged.
LISA
Okay.
o~ MATTY

Don't say,”okay.” Ask anyone.

LISA
It’s beautiful. Thank you.

Matty looks disappointed.

LISA
Well, I don’t know what to say.

MATTY
(coaching)
You’re blown away?

LISA
I’m blown away.

Matty grins..suddenly George sticks his head in the door. He
sees them.

GEORGE
Oh, sorry.

LISA
Hey. You showed?

 
129

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 130.

GEORGE
Yes. I'll be right out here.

MATTY
Good to see you.

GEORGE
Thanks.

He ducks out.

MATTY
We better get going. Our first
party as a couple.

LISA
What were we those other times?

He hugs her.

INT. MATTY'S LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT 129

All the ball players crowded in as a man with a jump suit and
a JET HELICOPTER LOGO on his back carries in two large crates
of live lobster to the kitchen. He is moving with
considerable speed. .some of the ballplayers applaud.

ON GEORGE

As he pauses on the outskirts of the gathering. .from his
pocket he takes a small jar shaped gift wrapped box.

GEORGE'S POV

As Lisa enters the room and starts to head over, then shrugs
helplessly, as Matty intercepts her to show off her new
watch.. There are SEVERAL REACTION SHOTS from the players and
their women to the watch. George moves to the terrace where a
buffet line has already formed for the LOBSTER..

ON LISA

Her arm extended showing her watch while her head cranes
looking for George.

LISA
Let me go find George, he doesn’t
know anybody.

MATTY
(uncomfortable then)
I‘11 come with you.

 
130

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 131.

As they start for the terrace, Matty is waylaid by Tori (the

Japanese pitcher.) He is with the girl whose bodice caught
his note. She clearly loves the guy-

ON LISA

As George comes Up behind her and forcefully moves her out to
the terrace..---

EXT. MATTY’S APT. - ‘TERRACE - NIGHT : 130

GEORGE
I have to talk with you.

LISA
Sure. How you doing?

GEORGE
Pretty good.. heightened awareness,
anxious, excited.. I got you 4
gift.

He hands her the package. She sits at a small metal outdoor
table. She opens it elaborately and slowly. He waits
patiently. Somehow she becomes aware of a strange rush of
appreciation for this small fact - that briefly though
enormously touches her. She stops unwrapping to look at him
and unconsciously say 4 mouthful.

LISA
Thanks for not rushing me.

George reacts to the screaming subtext as, finally, she sees
the gift. And whatever petals of hers were just opening slam
shut. She is puzzled. His stock has clearly fallen.

LISA
Man, you are odd.

We now see the gift. It is the can of Play-Doh George took

from his office. We will also have seen it in the background
of a few shots jn his apartment -

GEORGE
Odd good or odd bad?

LISA
Well, I‘ma fan of regular.
WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 132.

GEORGE
That's only half the gift. It's
nothing without the story. The
story makes it regular.

She is skeptical - he starts selling hard.

SHOT

GEORGE
(continued)
This stuff was invented by a man in
central Ohio as a white goo used to
remove soot from wallpaper, which
got really filthy from old
fashioned heating.

So as gas and electric heating came
in there was no more need for this

school teacher...

LISA
(interrupting)
This is a true story?

GEORGE
(triumphantly)
The man’s name was Joe McVicker,
his sister-in-law was Kay zoofall.

LISA
Okay, I believe you.

a lot more than hard modeling clay.
She suggested to her brother-in-law

call it Play-Doh.

So I just kept this around. .for
proof that we're just one small
adjustment away from making our

thought of this for you.

LISA
Yes.

GEORGE
Take back what you said about me
being odd.

LISA
Fair enough.

(she brandishes the gift)
Thanks. I’m going to put it away
before anyone asks me what I’m
doing with it. I could never tell
that story as well as you do.

She exits. George watches her go. So does Matty who now
approaches George.

MATTY
Hey, you try the lobster?

GEORGE
Not yet.

MATTY
You should.
(looking at his watch)
One hour and fifty-one minutes ago
it was swimming in the ocean.

GEORGE
Way to go.

Yeah. Unintended and unwarranted
but, yeah.... Sorry.

Before George can answer.. .the bullpen guys approach. .Doug

that he was in love) and Tori who we have just seen with his

He met his girl when we were all in
the bullpen discussing how you know
when you're in love.

GEORGE
(sincerely)
Great question.

Lisa approaches. Matty, 2 little pugnaciously, seeks to put
George on the spot.

MATTY
Got an answer? We got an answer.

GEORGE
Let's see.

He concentrates. It is a weirdly long beat.

RYAN
You can get back to us.

The players laugh. But George has a bead on the answer.

GEORGE
You're in this space that hasn‘t
existed before and the only two
things you know is that you are in
this space, and..

GEORGE (cont 'd)
(he sees Lisa)
As “odd" ag that is, the only other
thing you are just as sure of is
that she’s in there with you.

MATTY
Yeah, that’s close to our thing.

Doug notes Lisa’s reaction to George.

DOUG
{to Matty)
Curtains.

He walks to Lisa. She is staggered but hanging onto
propriety. She tries to treat it lightly.

LISA
What’s with you tonight?

GEORGE
I need to talk to you. Really. And
that means I have to get you out of
this party. And if that feels out
of the question to you; there's
probably nothing to talk about.

MATTY
Show him the watch.
GEORGE
I'm going to wait at the bus stop
for the next ---SEVEN DAYS. .No.
T’1l hang out there a while.
He leaves.
ON LISA

She goes through the five stages of compliance..what are they
again? Amusement, confusion, awkwardness, resistance,
decision. With decision she tugs at Matty's sleeve to
indicate she needs a moment of privacy with him. They walk to
another area. .Matty with the airs of confidence...once they
find their spot. Before she can speak.

MATTY
Don’t dump me.

LISA
Matty, I think you’re moving a
little too quickly.

WHITE DRAFT 5/29/09 136.

MATTY
First time I've been accused of
that.

LISA

You can’t make important decisions
when your head is mush. And tonight
is extremely confusing to me..
George never...Maybe I’1l just go
hang out with him. I don’t know
what to do at these parties
anyway..And this isn't really for
my birthday...none of my friends
are here.

MATTY
That was my mistake..should have
thought of that. Too little, too
late and stupid. I can learn from

this.

LISA
You're fine, you’re sweet, you're
fun..

MATTY

All the hot words.

LISA
This is positive. We're not ducking
anything. .Everything’s out in the
open.

MATTY
You know what. Go ahead. Hang out.
But I want you to take in that I’m
the kind of guy who has the
confidence to say that. That’s key
to any decision you make.

LISA
Got it.

She puts the diamond watch on the valet chair tray..She looks
at him...this parting not easy for either one..Matty is
trying to duck the unique pang which is enveloping him. With
utter lack of conviction:

MATTY
I’m confident.

She ig touched. She hugs him and exits.

ANGLE ON DOORMAN AND HIS POV

toward him more somber. .

INT. BUS - NIGHT 134

Lisa and George sitting together. .George continues to look at
her but fails to make eye contact. “Lisa steels peeks at

him... not overjoyed by his seeming deliverance.
GEORGE
You know what‘s amazing..---- do
you?
LISA.
No.
GEORGE

All the worst things happened to me
and if they hadn't we wouldn’t be
here now, So. “really something...
Is something wrong?

Liga reacts by burying her head in her hands and rubbing her
hands through her hair.

LISA
Well, yes--

She buries her face in her hands..

GEORGE
Do you have a problem with me?
LISA
Yes.
GEORGE

I'd sure like to know what it is.
She looks at him directly for the first time.
LISA
You're in love with me and I'm on a
second date.
GEORGE

That sums it up-

EXT. GEORGE'S APT - NIGHT 135
As we look in from the street.

The windows open..Lisa at the refrigerator taking out some
food. George leans over to help her. Lisa exits to the next
room.

We see Lisa enter the living room and place plates on the
table by the window; as George puts their dinner in the
microwave in the adjoining kitchen window.

Lisa stands still and tall and thinks..she is, at this
moment, the poster girl for “private moments.” Her thought is
as nervous making as it is insistent. She decides, after a
long layoff from same, to trust her instincts. She exits
frame.

George turns as she enters the kitchen. She kisses him.
