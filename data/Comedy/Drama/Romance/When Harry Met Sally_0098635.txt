DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE i

of an OLDER COUPLE, a MAN and a WOMAN. They're sitting
together on a loveseat looking straight at the CAMERA.

(The documentary dialogue that follows is meant only as
an indication; the movie will use real people, not
actors, and we will be hearing their actual stories,
which will be similar to the ones indicated here.)

MAN

I was sitting with my friend,
Arthur Kornblum, in a restaurant,
it was a Horn & Hardart Cafeteria,
they don't have them any more, and
this girl walked in --

(he points to the
wee. Woman beside him). Le.
-- and I turned to Arthur and I
said, “Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her." And two
weeks later we were married. And
it’s 50 years later and we're still
married.

FADE OUT.

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - DAY 2
CARD: TEN YEARS AGO

A couple in a clinch.

The young man involved is named HARRY BURNS. He's 26
years old, just graduated from law school. Wearing
jeans and a sweatshirt.

He's kissing a young woman named AMANDA. She has long
straight hair that she irons. She's about 20. The
embrace is fairly melodramatic. They pull back to look
at one another.

AMANDA
I love you.

HARRY
I love you.

They begin to kiss again.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: Revised 8/3/88

2 A car pulls up right beside them. Stops. Sits there. 2

Driving the car is SALLY ALBRIGHT. She's 21 years old.
She's very pretty although not necessarily in an
obvious way. She sits there waiting for the kiss to
end. It doesn't end. She clears her throat. They
don't hear her. She shifts position and accidentally-
on=purpose hits the car HORN, which beeps and startles
Amanda and Harry into breaking off their clinch.
Amanda sees Sally, and she and Harry move over to the
car.

AMANDA
Oh. Hi, Sally. Sally -- this is
Harry Burns. Harry, this is
__Sally Albright.____.

HARRY
Nice to meet you.

 

 

They shake hands.

SALLY
(to Harry) *
You want to drive the first shift?
HARRY
No, no == you're there already, you

can start.
Harry looks meaningfully at Amanda.

Then he starts to put his stuff -- a duffel bag, a box

of records -- into the back seat of the car, where
Sally's stuff is, too -- suitcases, stereo speakers, a
guitar, boxes of books, a small TV.
AMANDA *
Cail me.
HARRY *

I'll call as soon as I get there.

AMANDA *
Call me from the road.

. HARRY *
I'll call before that.

Harry and Amanda exchange longing looks outside the

car.

AMANDA
I love you.

BARRY
I love you, too.

They kiss again.
Sally sits waiting, waiting.
She hits the car HORN again. Harry and Amanda break
apart.
SALLY
Sorry.

Harry gets into the car and as it pulls away he and
Amanda exchange more “I love you's” and “I'll call
you's” and “Goodbyes.”

 

EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY 3

City traffic. Sally driving. Harry in the passenger
seat.

INT. CAR - DAY 4
Harry takes out a bunch of grapes, starts to eat them.

. SALLY
Tt have this all figured ont. It's
an 18 hour trip, which breaks down
to 6 shifts of 3 hours each. Or,
alternatively, we could break it *
down by mileage. There's a map on
the visor, I've marked it to show
the locations where we change shifts.
You can do three hours?

HARRY

Grape?

SALLY .
No. I don't like to eat between
meals.

Me, too.

A long awkward silence.

. HARRY
Why don‘t you tell me the story of

The story of my life?

HARRY
We've got 18 hours to kill before

we get to New York. :

SALLY 4
The story of my life isn't even
going to get us out of Chicago. I
mean, nothing's happened to me yet.
That's why I'm going to New York.

HARRY
So something can happen to you.
SALLY
Yes.
HARRY
Like what?
SALLY

Like I'm going to go to journalism

_School and become @ reporter. 2 =
HARRY

So you can write about things that

happen to other people.

SALLY
{after a beat)
That's one way to look at it.

HARRY
Suppose nothing happens to you.
Suppose you live there your whole
life and nothing happens and you
never meet anyone and you never
become anything and finally you die
one of those New York deaths where
nobody evan notices for two weeks
until the smell drifts out into the
hallway.

Sally looks over at Harry. Who am I stuck in this car
with? She looks back at the road.
EXT. CAR - TRAVELING SHOT - DAY 5

As the car turns onto the highway.

SALLY (V.0.)
Amanda mentioned you had a dark
side.

HARRY

That's what drew her to me.
INT. CAR - DAY 6
SALLY
Your dark side?

HARRY
Yeah. Why? Don't you have a. dark
side? No. You're probably one of
those cheerful people who dots her
"i's" with little hearts.

SALLY
(defensively)
I have just as much of a dark side
as the next person --

HARRY
{pleased with himself)
Oh, really? When I get a new book,
I read the last page first. That
way, if I die before I finish I
_ _ know how it comes out. That, my _
friend, is a dark side.
SALLY
(irritated now)
It doesn't mean you're deep or
anything. I mean, I'm basically a
happy person.

HARRY
(cheerfully)
So am I.
SALLY
..eand I don't see that there's
anything wrong with that.

HARRY
Of course you don't. You're too
busy being happy. Do you think
about death?

SALLY
Yes.

HARRY
Sure you do. A fleeting thought
that drifts in and out of the
transom of your mind. I spend
hours, I spend days --

SALLY
(interrupting)
-- and you think this makes you 4
better person?

“Priddy, Helen” comes home, she says,

"I don't know if I want to be married

any more." You know, like it's the

institution, like it's nothing personal,

like it's just something she's thinking

about in a kind of casual way. I'm calm.

I say, why don't we think about it,

take some time, don’t rush into anything. *

Next day she says she's thought about it,

she wants a trial separation. She just

wants to try it, she says. We can still

date, she says, like this is supposed to

cushion the blow. I mean, I got married

so I could stop dating, so I don't see

where “we can still date" is a big incentive

since as far as I'm concerned the last

thing you want to do is date your wife,

who's supposed to love you, which is

what I'm saying to her when it crosses

my mind maybe she doesn't, so I say,

"Don't you love me anymore?“ and you

know what she says? I don't know if

I've ever loved you.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE - NIGHT 138

Barry back in reality. Thinking about what just happened
in his mind. He feels the cold and turns his collar up,
then starts walking slowly away from the arch. We stay
with Harry as his pace start to quicken and finally ends
with him running down the street.

INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY - NIGHT 139

It's almost midnight. Balloons, confetti, the mirrored
ball spinning slowly around.

The excitement in the room builds as we approach midnight.

We see Sally with a group of friends, including Jess and
Marie.

— ~~~ SALLY —
{going for her coat)
I'm going.

MARIE
It‘s almost midnight.

SALLY
I can't stand the thought of not
kissing somebody.

JESS
Big deal. I'11 kiss you. *

SALLY
Thanks Jess. But I have to go.

SALLY
I'll cail you tomorrow.
She turns to go.
She stops dead in her tracks.
It's Harry.

Slowly he comes towards her, and stops in front of her.

HARRY

I've been doing a lot of thinking.

And the thing is, I love you. *
SALLY :

What? *
HARRY

seo. - - TI love youe-—-— -- - ~---- - as of

SALLY

How do you expect me to respond to

this?
HARRY

How about you love me, too? *
SALLY

How about, I'm leaving. *

Sally turns and walks off, parting the crowd.
Harry follows her like a terrier.

RARRY
Doesn't what I said mean anything
to you?

During the following, we hear the countdown to the New
Year, after which everyone breaks into “Happy New
Year", confetti flies, everyone is kissing and breaking
into Auld Lang Syne.
SALLY
What is it supposed to mean? I'm .
sorry, Harry. I know it's New Year‘s Eve
and I know you're feeling lonely, but
you can't just show up here and tell me
you love me and expect that to make it all
right. I mean, what am I supposed to say?
Great, Harry, you love me, that settles every-
thing, now we can waltz off into the sunset
together? It doesn't work this way.

HARRY

Well, how does it work?

SALLY
I don't know, but not this way.
Beat.

HARRY
How about this way. I love how you
get cold when it's 62 degrees out.
I love the way your mouth turns down
just a little bit, right there. I love
how it takes you an hour and a half to
order a sandwich. I even loved when
you used my sweater for a kleenex. I
love it that after spending the day with
you I can still smell your perfume on
my clothes. I love how you're the last
person I want to talk to before I go
to sleep at night. It took me
eleven years to figure this out. And
I came here tonight because when you
realize you want to spend the rest of
your life with someone, you want the rest *
of your life to start as soon as possible.

SALLY
(furious )
See, that's just like you, Harry.
You say things like that, and you
make it impossible for me to hate
ou ==
y {almost in tears)
And I hate you. I hate you, Harry,
I hate you.

She starts to cry.

Harry puts his arms around her.

They kiss.

A long kiss.

The twinkle ball goes around, twinkling.

“They go on kissing.
Auld Lang Syne continues in the background.

HARRY
My whole life I have never known
what this song means.

SALLY
I know exactly what you mean.

HARRY
I mean, should old acquaintance be
forgot. Does that mean we should
forget old acquaintances, or does
it mean if we do happen to forget
them, we should remember them,
which is not possible because we
forgot them --

SALLY
Maybe you're just supposed to
remember you forgot them, or
something -- anyway, it's about old
friends.

They start to kiss again.
And as the camera PULLS UP away from them.
HARRY (V.0.)
The first time we met we hated each

other.
