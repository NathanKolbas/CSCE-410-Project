INT. BLACK 1

The following conversation takes place over BLACK or CREDITS.

BRIE
Hello?

LUKE
Hey Brie?

BRIE
Yeah?

LUKE
It's Luke.

BRIE
Hi Luke.

LUKE

What's going on?

BRIE
Um, I'm actually putting away some
groceries I just got.

LUKE
Oh yeah?

BRIE
Yeah.

LUKE

What'd you get?

BRIE
Um. Are you serious, do you want
me to tell you?

LUKE
No, I guess not. Unless it's,
like, a ton of cat food and you
don’t have a cat.

BRIE
Actually I have fifteen cats.

LUKE
Well, that's weird.

BRIE
Now you know.
LUKE
So, did you still want to hang out
tonight?

BRIE
Yeah, but I have to meet up with
some friends later on so do you
mind if we meet kind of early?

LUKE
Sure, what time were you thinking?
BRIE
Do you want to meet at seven?
LUKE
No.
BRIE
No?
LUKE

I'm just kidding, seven is fine.

BRIE
Is that enough time for you to get
ready? I'm sure that bed head
takes at least thirty minutes to
get into place.

LUKE
So this is how it's gonna be, is
it?
Brie laughs.
BRIE

You scared? You want to call the
whole thing off?

LUKE
No, no. So I'll see you at seven
at The Scene, right?

BRIE
Yeah.

LUKE
Sounds good.

BRIE
Okay. See you there.
LUKE
Okay. Bye.
BRIE
Bye.
EXT. LOS ANGELES- LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING 2

A series of shots show the areas of L.A. County winding down
from a hard days work.

It’s a typical, beautiful evening.

INT. LUKE'S CAR- 6:44 PM 3
LUKE PUTNAM (25) drives down Santa Monica Blvd. listening to
music. He checks his reflection one more time in the rear
view mirror.

EXT. THE SCENE, GLENDALE- 6:58 PM 4
Luke drives by the bar slowly, looking out the window for any
sign of Brie outside. None.

EXT. GLENDALE BLVD.- 7:01 PM 5
Luke walks up to the front of the bar and looks around.

After a minute of looking he pulls out his phone and dials a
number.

COLIN (0.S.)
Hello?
LUKE
Colin. Hey.
COLIN (0.S.)
Hey Luke, what’s up?
LUKE
Not much.
COLIN (0.S.)

Are you on your date?

LUKE
Actually, I’m waiting outside.
We're supposed to meet at seven.
(MORE )
LUKE (CONT'D)
I’m just calling because I felt
like a tool just standing here
waiting for her.

COLIN (0.S.)
Right. Understood. Isn’t seven a
little early?

LUKE
Yeah, I thought so. She said she
wanted to get together early
because she has to meet up with her
friends later. I don’t know if
maybe she was giving herself an out
just in case or if it’s true, but I
said whatever.

COLIN (0.S.)
Definitely sounds like an out.

LUKE
Yeah. Hopefully she won't use it.

Luke turns and looks around again.

COLIN (0.S.)
What’s her name again?

LUKE
Brie, like the cheese. And
actually, I think I see her car.

COLIN (0.S.)
Oh, okay.

LUKE
Wait. Just hang on the line a
second.

COLIN (0.S.)
Okay.

Luke tries to look in the door as someone leaves.

COLIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I'm watching this video on YouTube
and.

LUKE
Alright, I’1l talk to you later
man.

COLIN (0.S.)
Okay, have fun.
Luke closes the flap on his phone
bouncer.

BOUNCER
Got your I.D.?

LUKE
Yeah.

Luke pulls out his wallet and I.D.

Bouncer.

BOUNCER
Alright man, have fun.

LUKE
Thanks.

INT. THE SCENE- CONTINUOUS

and heads over to the

and shows it to the

Luke walks into the bar and sees Brie sitting at a corner
table with three guys. One of them is SCOTT (28), who turns

and looks behind him.

Luke points at him and his expression reads “You?”

Scott acknowledges and turns to Brie.

scott

This is the guy you’re waiting for?

BRIE
Yeah.

Luke gets to the table and extends a hand to shake.

LUKE
What’s up Scott?

BRIE
You know him?

LUKE
Yeah.

sScoTtT

We worked together.

BRIE
Where? At our office?

LUKE

Yeah, Scott’s one of the editors.
One of the other guys at the table, JOSH (30) chimes in.

JOSH
What’s going on?

scoTtT
Sit down, sit down.

LUKE
Uh, I’m gonna get a drink. You-

Luke points at Brie but realizes she has a drink in front of
her.

LUKE (CONT'D)
-are good. Okay. I’11 be back.

Luke heads over to the bar.

sScoTtT
That's really weird.
BRIE
Yeah, I work at the reception desk.
scoTtT
Really? Which floor? I’ve never
seen you.
BRIE

Look harder buddy. I’m there.
AT THE BAR

The bartender is in the middle of telling Luke that they’re
out of the beer he wants.

BARTENDER
No, we don’t have it.
LUKE
Really? Okay, can I get a Coors

Light?

The bartender pours a draft while Luke looks around some
more.

BARTENDER
That’s four.

Luke hands him a debit card.

BARTENDER (CONT’D)
You want to start a tab?
LUKE
Yeah, please.

Luke grabs his drink and heads off.
AT THE TABLE

Luke makes his way over to sit next to Brie, which puts him
slightly and awkwardly out of the circle of conversation.

Scott turns to him.
scoTtT
Hey sorry, this is Josh and this is
Darrell.

Josh and Darrell both give nods or small waves.

LUKE
Hey, what’s up?

Brie turns to Luke and finally exchanges a personal greeting.

BRIE
Hi.
LUKE
Hi. How’s it going?
BRIE
Good.
LUKE
What are you drinking?
BRIE
A little whiskey.
LUKE
Nice.
BRIE
How about you?
LUKE
Uh, Coors Light. The Silver
Bullet.
BRIE
Fancy.
LUKE

Yeah. So you don’t know these
guys?
Suddenly Luke notices that no one at the table has been
talking. It’s just him and Brie while the rest of the guys
sit, arms folded, small smiles on their faces.

BRIE
No, I just said hello while I was
waiting for you. Isn’t that weird?

LUKE
Yeah.

BRIE
I got here a little early and I
didn’t want to do that thing where
you just get out your cell phone
and talk to someone so you don’t
look stupid so I just came in to
get a drink and said hello.

LUKE
Wow.

Scott angles back in.

sScoTtT
So, Darrell here is getting
married.
BRIE
Really?
DARRELL
Yeah.
BRIE
Congratulations! That’s great.
JOSH
Is it?
BRIE
Of course it is.
DARRELL
Thanks.
sScoTtT

We're trying to talk him out of it.
He’s only been dating her for three
months.

LUKE
Wow.
BRIE
Don’t listen to them.

JOSH
Three months! It’s like, a season.

scoTtT
(to Brie mostly)
You want to know why I think he’s
getting married?

Luke takes a sip of beer.

DARRELL
It’s not true.
JOSH
It is.
sScoTtT

It’s because he’s going bald.

DARRELL
Why would you tell them that?

sScoTtT
That's why he’s wearing that cap.

BRIE
So what if he’s going bald?

sScoTtT
Because he’s worried that when he
goes bald he’s not going to be able
to land any other girls.

BRIE
What?

DARRELL
It’s not true.

JOSH

(a la “Seinfeld”)

He’s BALD!

sScoTtT

Take off your hat.

DARRELL
No!
10.

BRIE
There’s plenty of bald guys that
get laid.

JOSH

Not with hot girls.

BRIE
I’m sure I’ve seen some bald guys
with attractive girls.

sScoTtT
Would you date a bald guy?
BRIE
Me? I don’t know.
scoTtT
(answering for her)
No.
BRIE
Maybe! It depends!
JOSH
Come on.
BRIE

Look, flowing locks is the not the
only quality I look for in a man
but I mean, I prefer hair. I can

admit that.
sScoTtT
Everybody prefers hair.
BRIE
But true love is hair-blind.
sScoTtT
Hair-blind?
BRIE
Yeah.
sScoTtT

But you gotta get the girl to fall
in love with you first and that’s
much harder to do if you're bald.

BRIE
I think you are underestimating
most girls.
11.

JOSH
Girls are stupid.

Brie bristles visibly.

BRIE
What?

Brie’s stare is cold as ice. Darrell and Scott pick up on it
but Josh doesn’t.

DARRELL
Look, this is one big conversation
that doesn’t need to be happening
because I’m not going bald.

BRIE
(not budging)
Why are girls stupid?

sScoTtT
Josh is stupid, don’t worry about
it.

JOSH

I’m just saying.
Luke touches the sleeve of Brie’s jacket.

LUKE
I like this jacket.

BRIE
Thanks.

Brie barely registers the compliment. Instead her whole
demeanor changes and she slouches back into her seat.

sScoTtT
Dude Luke, you bailed just in time.
The office is getting insane.

LUKE
Really?

sScoTtT
Mark just started losing his mind
for no apparent reason and the work
load has totally doubled.

LUKE
That sucks.
12.

sScoTtT
Have you found a new job yet?

LUKE
Nope. Not really looking for one.

scoTtT
Nice. Living the dream.

JOSH
What do you do?

LUKE
I was an assistant. Like an intern
at his office.

JOSH
(to Brie)
And you work there too?

BRIE
Yep.
JOSH
Crazy.
DARRELL
Hey. Hey. I’m sorry I forgot your
name.
BRIE
Brie.
DARRELL

Sorry. Brie, like the cheese.
I’1ll remember that.. Let me ask
you something.

JOSH
Dude wait. You know who else is
named after cheese and is amazing?

BRIE
Who?

JOSH
Monterey Jack from Chip ‘n’ Dale
Rescue Rangers.

Scott laughs.
13.

JOSH (CONT'D)
Right?! Whenever he smelled cheese
he would just start floating toward
it like a zeppelin. Amazing.

DARRELL
A zeppelin?
JOSH
Yeah.
DARRELL
Dude stop, I have a serious
question.
BRIE
Okay. . .
DARRELL

I’m getting married in four months
and we have a date set and
everything. And so now my fiancee
wants to stop having sex from now
until the wedding so it can feel
kind of like having sex for the
first time again on the wedding
night.

BRIE
Okay.

DARRELL
Isn't that stupid?

BRIE
That’s the question?

DARRELL
I mean, is this a female thing? Am
I crazy or does it not make any
sense?

BRIE
I don’t know. It doesn’t make
sense to me, but if she feels
strongly about it and it makes
sense to her then you should
probably just do it.

DARRELL
We had sex on the first night we
met.
scoTtT
He tells this to everyone when he
first meets them.

DARRELL
So it’s like, what’s the point?

BRIE
Like I said, I don’t know. I gave
a guy a handjob at an assembly in
ninth grade but some people are
just weird about sex.

Luke’s eyes visibly widen as he takes a big sip of beer.

DARRELL
Wow.

BRIE
She probably just feels guilty. Is
she religious or her parents, are
they really religious?

DARRELL
Not really.

sScoTtT
Wait, so could other kids see you
giving him the handjob in the
assembly?

BRIE
No, he put his backpack on his lap
or something. It was discreet.

JOSH
Dude, tell them what happened.

DARRELL
What happened what?

JOSH
When you met her parents.

DARRELL
No. Stop interrupting!

Scott bursts out laughing. Luke and Brie are lost.

scoTtT
It’s brilliant.

DARRELL
No no.

14.
15.

JOSH

Tell the fucking story!
DARRELL

Shut up.
JOSH

I'm telling it.

DARRELL
God damn you guys.

Scott continues laughing.
Luke is almost done with his beer.

JOSH
So Darrell went and spent the
weekend with his girlfriend's
parents last week. They live in
Michigan.

BRIE
Is this an embarrassing meet the
parents story?

sScoTtT
Big time.

JOSH
He was in Michigan and his
girlfriend's parents took everyone
out for an engagement party kind of
deal and this guy gets hammered.
Just fucking stone cold drunk.

DARRELL
Everybody was buying me shots.

JOSH
So they go back to the house late
that night and him and his
girlfriend try to have sex.

DARRELL
What? What do you mean try?

JOSH
You said you fell asleep like three
minutes into it.

scott
Three minutes into it is two
minutes after it’s over.
16.

DARRELL
Yeah, I fell asleep but we had sex
for a little bit first.

JOSH
Whatever, so they fall asleep naked
and he wakes up at like 4 am
feeling like he’s gonna barf.

DARRELL
It was inevitable.

JOSH
He stumbles to the bathroom, still
naked and pukes like six times.

BRIE
This story is fucking gross so far.

JOSH
Hang on, hang on. So, he finishes
up and stumbles back into the
bedroom, climbs back into bed and
falls asleep. It’s not until the
next morning does anybody realize
that he had gone back into the
wrong room and climbed naked into
bed with his girlfriend’s brother.

DARRELL
My future brother-in-law.

Brie laughs. Scott is cracking up too.

BRIE
That’s not true.
JOSH
It’s totally fucking true.
BRIE
That kind of shit doesn’t happen to
people.
DARRELL
I wish it didn’t but it did.
sScoTtT
Amazing.
BRIE

Was he mad?
17.

DARRELL
He took it pretty well. He was
cool. It wasn’t as damaging as it
could have been.

BRIE
Wow.

DARRELL
I know, I know. Believe me, I
thought that stuff only happened in
John Hughes movies, but no.

BRIE
John Hughes?

DARRELL
Yeah, there’s a scene like that in
Planes, Trains and Automobiles.

BRIE
I haven't seen it.

JOSH
“Those aren’t pillows!”

LUKE
It’s good.

Luke is finished with his beer and sees a break in the
conversation.

LUKE (CONT'D)
(to Brie)
You want another drink?
Brie looks at her drink- just a few sips left.
BRIE
Actually, I should probably get
going to meet my friends.
Luke looks a little frustrated.

LUKE
Oh yeah?

BRIE
Yeah.
18.

sScoTtT
The best part of that movie is when
John Candy turns into the devil for
like three seconds when they are
stuck in between the two trucks.
Like, for no reason, he has a devil
costume on for three seconds and
he’s screaming.

BRIE
(to Luke)
I’m gonna have a cigarette though,
do you want one?

LUKE
Uh, sure.
BRIE
Okay.
EXT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER 7

Luke and Brie stand outside the bar on the corner. Brie
pulls a pack of American Spirits out of her purse and hands
one to Luke.

He twiddles it around his fingers while she pulls one out for
herself.

BRIE
Hang on.

Brie approaches a SMOKER standing next to them.

BRIE (CONT’D)
Excuse me, do you have a light?

SMOKER
Yeah.

Smoker pulls a Zippo out of his pocket and lights it for
Brie. She dangles her cigarette in and takes a puff.

BRIE
Thanks.

Brie comes back over to Luke and offers him her smoke.

BRIE (CONT'D)
Here.
19.

LUKE
Thanks. How come you have
cigarettes but no lighter?

BRIE
It’s a way of trying to quit. Cut
down at least.

LUKE
Does it work?

BRIE
Does it look like it’s working?

Luke lights his cigarette with hers and hands it back.

LUKE
So you gotta go huh?

BRIE
Yeah, I think so. My friends are
kind of waiting for me.

LUKE
That’s cool.

BRIE
I can’t believe you know those
guys.

LUKE

I don’t know all those guys, just
Scott. We just worked together.
But now we don’t.

BRIE
So, this was your first week of
unemployment, right?

LUKE
Yeah, I’m on day three.

BRIE
But you’ve got a plan.

LUKE
I’m working on a piece that I
pitched to the Times.

BRIE
The New York Times? Jesus. You
didn’t tell me that.
20.

LUKE
The L.A. Times.

BRIE
Oh. That’s cool too.

LUKE
Well, they have this kind of long-
winded editorial process so I’m
getting bounced around a little
bit. But they’re giving me time,
which is nice.

BRIE
That is nice of them. You've got
enough money to make it last?

LUKE
That’s the plan. I took out a loan
from the bank.
(beat)
I figure it’s like going back to
school but I get to spend the money
the way I want.

BRIE
That's pretty smart. How much did
you get?

LUKE

They gave me a loan for five
thousand dollars.

BRIE
That’s it?

LUKE
I’m eating sandwiches.

Brie raises her eyebrows.
BRIE

I would have asked for ten. If
you’re gonna go, go all the way.

LUKE
Well I’m just more frugal than you
are.

BRIE

Or less daring.
21.

LUKE
I always thought it would be funny
to do a spoof show of “The
Fraggles”, you know that show?

BRIE
Of course.

LUKE
But have it be “The Frugals”
instead and it’s just a bunch of
tight wad investors and bankers
living underground being like “You
spent how much on socks!?”

Brie chuckles. Luke is pleased.
They take a drag.

LUKE (CONT'D)
How about you? How’ve you been?

BRIE
Uh, fine. Work is boring and
stressful.

LUKE

Yeah but that building would
collapse if you weren't there.

BRIE
Ha, right. And that’s the only
reason I’m still there. To hold
that building up.

LUKE
Well, what else would you be doing?

BRIE
I mean, I don’t know. I guess I
can’t complain. It’s a safe job and
I’m making money. The money’s not
the problem, you know?

LUKE
Yeah, totally.

BRIE
Yeah, for Christmas last year I
bought my mom her first pair of
really expensive shoes. Not her
first pair- you know.
22.

LUKE
How expensive?

BRIE
Just- expensive. They don’t have
them where she lives. I don’t even
think she knew they existed. I
mean, she used to be this fashion
maven but she’s starting to lag a
bit in her old age. So, I gotta
pick up her slack.

LUKE
I know what you mean. I won a game
show and-
BRIE
Wait, you won a game show?
LUKE
Yeah.
BRIE
Which one?
LUKE
You haven't heard of it.
BRIE
How do you know?
LUKE
Nobody's heard of it.
BRIE
Come on, what is it?
LUKE
It’s called On the Cover.
BRIE
What the hell is On the Cover?
LUKE
See?
BRIE

What is it?
23.

LUKE
It’s just. They show you a fake
magazine cover of like, People
Magazine with Denzel Washington's
picture on it and you have to name
who’s “on the cover”.

BRIE
That’s it?

LUKE
Yeah.

BRIE
Sounds easy.

LUKE
It is.

BRIE

And retarded.

LUKE
Have you ever done it? It’s tough
getting that buzzer to work before
anyone else's.

BRIE
Okay, okay. I’m sorry. But you
won, right?

LUKE
Yeah.

BRIE
How much money?

LUKE
Ten thousand bucks.

BRIE
Ten thousand bucks!? For a little
game show no one has heard of?

LUKE
Yeah, so that Christmas was the
first time I could ever afford to
get everyone in my family cool
presents.

BRIE
Jesus Christ.
24.

LUKE
I’m usually the guy that gives
everyone a CD or a book, but I
actually got some cool gifts that
year.

BRIE
Loans and game shows, no wonder you
don’t need a job.

LUKE
Exactly.
BRIE
How much do you have left?
LUKE
Why, you gonna order more expensive
drinks?
BRIE
Maybe.
LUKE
None.
BRIE
Come on.
LUKE

Really, none. I bought a car. Not
a new one or anything. A used one,
but I bought it straight up.
Caaash.

BRIE
So you're broke again?

LUKE
Broke is a strong word. No, I got
the loan. I got some savings. And
I have a car.

BRIE

I could totally win that show.
LUKE

I don’t know if it’s still on the

air.

They pause and smoke their cigarettes.
25.

BRIE
I’d do really well at Jeopardy.
It’s all proper names and places
and one or two-word responses and
I’m good at that stuff.

LUKE
Okay, what's the capitol of Cyprus?

BRIE
Cyprus? Greece?

LUKE
Sure.

BRIE
Nicosia.

LUKE
Really?

BRIE

Look it up. I remember it because
it’s spelled close to Nicoise
salad. Mnemonically.

LUKE
I’m impressed. Most people
something about Cyprus on the news
and think it’s like, a made-up
country.

BRIE
But Jeopardy. Or Presidents! I
know a shit-ton about presidents.
Half the stuff on Jeopardy is
presidential facts, so I wouldn't
even have to study that.

Luke smokes, doesn’t really inhale. Brie catches this, but
says nothing.

BRIE (CONT'D)
I'd win and I'd use the money to
buy my mom a house. A beach house.
Out near Rockport or somewhere
maybe a little less uppity.

LUKE
Moms love beach houses.
26.

BRIE
It was really nice getting a solid
gift for my mother. Even if it was
just shoes.

LUKE
What did your dad get?

BRIE
Dad got a tie. It’s what he likes.

LUKE
My mom asked me to make her a mix
last year. She wanted to know what
I was listening to. I put some
songs on a CD for her and gave it
to her. I made her a mixtape. I
put “2 Minutes to Midnight” by Iron
Maiden as a hidden bonus track at
the end and she wasn’t nearly as
amused about that as I was.

BRIE
I don’t know that one.

LUKE
(sings but trails off mid-

way )
“2 Minutes to Midnight!!!!"

Brie nods and looks around.

A girl clacks outside on her heels. She pulls up next to
Brie. Her name is STACY and she talks loudly into her cell
phone.

STACY
I don’t care what he eats. It bores
me.
(beat)
Did she hit you? Did she hit him?

Brie and Luke listen as Brie finishes her cigarette.

STACY (CONT'D)
It doesn’t matter that he’s from
South America. People aren’t any
different down there. They follow
the same rules as the rest of the
world.

(beat)

There’s meat. And then there’s
grass.
27.

Luke catches Brie’s eye. He makes a face. She makes one back.

STACY (CONT'D)

And that’s what you’ve gotta tell
them.

(beat)
Hold on a second.

(turns to Brie; sotto

voce)
Can I have one of those, I’m so

sorry?
Brie, smiling, hands one over.

STACY (CONT'D)
Thank you.
(back into phone)
No, I’m sorry, I was talking to
someone.

Brie steps her cigarette out. She notices Luke has almost
half of his left.

BRIE
Slow smoker.

LUKE
Savor it, that’s what I say.

BRIE
You don’t smoke do you?

Luke inhales a drag and blows the smoke out confidently, as
if that answers the question.

LUKE
Sometimes.

They look around at the few other people standing outside. A
few feet away stand a GUY and a GIRL seemingly not very happy
with each other.

The guy holds his phone out and is texting away. The girl
looks at him with disgust.

After a moment and in one fell swoop she SWATS the phone out
of his hands and it BOUNCES on the concrete.

GUY
Jesus Christ!

Luke and Brie look at each other with wide eyes.
28.
LUKE
Yikes.

BRIE
I think there’s gonna be a fight.

LUKE
I think so too.

They look again but the couple have wandered off up the

street.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Have you ever been in a fight?

BRIE
No. Have you?

LUKE
Yeah. In eighth grade. Everybody
was picking fights and it was like,
the cool thing. So I picked the
smallest, weakest guy in the class
and I made him fight me.

BRIE
What a jerk!

LUKE
I know. His name was Dawson Mullen
and he was from Canada.

BRIE
Poor Dawson Mullen.

Brie gets out another cigarette to smoke.

LUKE
Our high school was right next to
this movie theatre called the
Bijou. When you wanted to pick a
fight with someone, you went up to
them and said ‘Bijou parking lot.
Two Thirty.’

BRIE
That was the call out?

Still listening, Brie bums another light off of someone.
29.

LUKE
Yeah. The thrown gauntlet. Bijou
parking lot was where all the real
shit went down. Pot smoking. All
that.

BRIE
I guess my friend Lauren’s house
would be our Bijou parking lot
equivalent because that’s where we
always did the bad stuff.

LUKE
So. There were a bunch of kids all
waiting on the grassy side of this
movie theatre. And they form this
big circle and we get in the
middle. And Dawson is like “Come
on, start something. Start

something.” So I pushed him and he
just clocks me in the face. Out of
nowhere.

BRIE
Ha!

LUKE

I didn’t fall over or anything but
man, it hurt. And I guess normal
people get angry when they get
punched in the face but I just kind
of realized that fighting was dumb.

BRIE
Aww, poor little pacifist.

LUKE
He sort of knocked some sense into
me. So, that was the end of the
fight.

BRIE
You lost in one punch?

LUKE
I forfeited.

BRIE
I kind of had a fight once. This
girl was really pissing me off in
tenth grade. She thought I was
flirting with her boyfriend or
something, which I probably was.
(MORE )
30.

BRIE (CONT'D)
But she tried to start something in
the cafeteria. And she was Puerto
Rican so the whole lunch room split
into whites versus Puerto Ricans
for the fight that never actually
happened. It was like the Jets
versus the Sharks.

LUKE
Huh.

BRIE
West Side Story reference. Don’t
worry if you don’t get it, I’m the
nerd, not you.

LUKE
I was in West Side Story.
BRIE
Really? Who’d you play?
LUKE
(thinks)

Like, Jet Boy number four.
Brie laughs.

BRIE
That’s hilarious.

LUKE

I remember we had to give ourselves
names on these character sheets, to
make you feel like you were really
“acting.” And so I turned mine in
with the name “Davey”. But my
friends all turned in these cool
names like “Action” and “One
Punch”. And I was stuck with

“Davey”.

BRIE
I had to do the same thing when I
was a pink lady in “Grease”. We

had those sheets too. You had to
fill in all this unnecessary
information like what our favorite
ice cream flavor and stuff was. So
dumb.

LUKE
Can I have another one of those?
31.

Brie hands Luke another cigarette and he lights it with hers.

LUKE (CONT'D)

My high school did this
Shakespeare play called “The Merry
Wives of Windsor”. I wasn’t in it
but I saw it, and there’s a scene
where two guys are talking to each
other. And they’re talking about
something, but I guess they forget
their lines because there’s just
this sudden silence: like, fifteen
seconds of nothing. Then one guy
turns to the other and says “So,
how ‘bout the Bulls?”

BRIE
No.

LUKE
Swear to God. And this is during
the playoffs, so the other guy’s
like: “Repeat the three-peat!” So
they talk about the Bulls for a
good two minutes. I guess someone
was supposed to enter and they
didn’t or something, but then the
three-peat guy just got up and
started doing the worm.

BRIE
Oh my god.

LUKE
The audience loved it. They all
cheered when he did the worm. In
the middle of “The Merry Wives of
Windsor”.

BRIE
That’s hilarious.

LUKE
That’s Tennessee.

BRIE
I saw a production of “West Side
Story” that was like, the traveling
Broadway production. And you know
how in the end, Chino is supposed
to run out on stage with the gun
and shoot Tony?
32.

LUKE
Yeah.

BRIE
Well I guess the guy playing Chino
forgot the gun because he runs out
on the stage. Pauses for a second.
Then takes off his shoe and yells
“Poison boot!” and throws it at
Tony.

Luke laughs.

BRIE (CONT’D)

And it hits him in the chest and he
just looks at it for a second and
then falls over.

LUKE
Poison boot?

BRIE
Best improv ever. But the best
part is that the scene has to
continue and Maria has to pick up
the shoe and be like “How much
poison is left in this boot, Chino?
Enough for you? Enough for me?”

LUKE
That’s worse than the worm.

BRIE
Way worse.

LUKE
Do you still do any theater?

BRIE
No. I got over that.

LUKE
Yeah, me too. My swansong was the
Head Flying Monkey in “The Wiz”.

BRIE
“The Wizard of Oz"?
LUKE
No, no. “The Wiz”.
BRIE

Really?
33.

LUKE
Oh yeah. Public school’s are all
about color blind casting. We had
white people trying to sing soul in
“The Wiz”, we did “The Sound of
Music” with three white and two
Filipino Von Trapp kids. And we
even had black Nazis in “The Sound
of Music”.

BRIE
Wow.

LUKE
Jesus. I haven’t thought about
this stuff in a long time. It is

absurd.

BRIE
I love it. I love High School
stuff.

They are finished with their cigarettes.

BRIE (CONT'D)
You want to go back inside?

LUKE
Yeah.

They turn to head back into the bar and are met at the
doorway by Scott, Darrell and Josh heading out.

scoTtrT
Hey, we're heading to that other
bar if you guys want to come.

LUKE
Umm. I think we’re gonna hang out
here a bit more.

sScoTtT
Okay. Come to Saddle Ranch on
Sunset if you change your mind.

LUKE
Okay. See you.

DARRELL
Nice meeting you.

BRIE
Bye.
10

34.

INT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER 8

Luke stands at the bar ordering two more drinks.

EXT. LOS ANGELES- EVENING 9

The sun has set and the night takes over the city. It’s a
cool, calm evening all across Los Angeles.

INT. THE SCENE- LATER 10

Brie and Luke stand by the wall of the bar, drinking and
talking.

LUKE
You work with kids, right?

BRIE
Yeah, I do. I work with middle and
elementary school kids. Volunteer
work, mostly.

LUKE
I didn’t know you were a teacher.

BRIE
We do mostly after school stuff and
there’s workshops that we have
during the day. Kids from all these
schools around Venice take field
trips to come see us, so they’re
usually pretty happy to be
somewhere else.

LUKE
What do you work-shop with ten year-
olds?

BRIE

Well, one of them, my favorite
actually, is a storytelling
workshop. They come in and the idea
is to get them to write a story as
a group. I help them through. This
is pretty fun, actually. We have a
computer that projects up onto the
wall so you can see what’s being
typed.

LUKE
Sounds like a big operation.
35.

BRIE
It's pretty big. It’s me and five
other people. Got a typist, an
illustrator who draws on this pad
that’s connected to another
computer, but here’s the best part.
There’s a cranky editor named Mr.
Crabtree who lives in the attic,
and occasionally he'll come in over
this intercom. He’s like: “Where's
my stories! I'm trying to run a
publishing company here! I need
fifteen stories by twelve o'clock
or Brie's going to lose her job!"

LUKE
The kids respond to pressure like
that?

BRIE

Yeah. It’s just another one of the
volunteers in the office talking in
a grumpy voice through a baby
monitor. They get a kick out of it.
They kind of freeze up, but then
after awhile, after the editor
comes back on and yells at them a
little bit more, they get wise.
They usually spend most of the
workshop trying to figure out which
one of us is the voice from the
attic.

LUKE
And what exactly do you do?

BRIE
They come in and I ‘conduct’ them.
All on the floor sitting in a
circle, like fourteen or eighteen
kids. I ask them, what’s the first
thing you need to write a story?

Luke waits. Brie nods at him to answer the question.

LUKE
Oh, a title.

BRIE
No. The title comes last. You can’t
get married to a title early on.

LUKE
A main character?
36.

BRIE
Exactly. I ask them what their
favorite animal is, and we usually
go from there. Sometimes it’s
pirates or astronauts, but animals
always do well in a pinch.

LUKE
You've gotta make sure there’s a
boy and a girl, right?

BRIE
Gotta have both. If there’s more
girls in the class, the main
character becomes a girl squid or a
girl construction worker. Same
thing if it’s more boys.

LUKE
How long does it take.

BRIE
Two hours. We all write the story
together and then the kids have to
go and finish up their specific end
to the story.

LUKE
So you get fifteen stories with all
different endings?

BRIE
For the most part. You'd be
surprised how many of their endings
are the same. We try to push them
to be more inventive, but the kids
are of the same mind about things,
without even knowing it.

LUKE
So they all end with the girl squid
and the boy pirate living happily
ever after?

BRIE
You got a better ending?

LUKE
No. I wish those two all the best.
They deserve it.

The conversation lulls. Different CHARACTERS from the bar
take over.
11

37.

ADAM and MARINA are talking at a table.

MARINA
Delilah.

ADAM
That’s a great middle name.

MARINA
I love it. I’m going to name my
daughter Delilah.

ADAM

Did you grow up religious?
MARINA

Hunh? No.
ADAM

You know there’s major religious
overtones with a name like that.

MARINA
Really?

ADAM
Samson and Delilah? You don’t know
that story? She’s the one who cut
off all his hair when he was
asleep.

MARINA
She did what?

ADAM
Samson was the strongest man in the
city. And Delilah cut off his hair
with a pair of golden scissors. She
took his strength by cutting off
his hair.

MARINA
What book is that from?

Adam is incredulous.
ADAM
The bible?
AT ANOTHER SPOT 11

CHAS and DAPHNE sit at a table. Chas is wasted and scribbling
on a bar napkin.
12

38.
CHAS
Fifteen to ten!
Daphne sips at her drink. Looks horrified.

CHAS (CONT'D)
That's only five more points!

Daphne gets up, puts a napkin over her drink, and exits
frame. Chas sits alone. Eventually, he will go to the
bathroom and insult Luke’s penis.

ANOTHER SPOT 12

LEMUEL and NAN talking about the tissue bank she works at.

LEMUEL
You got a prostate?
NAN
Yesterday. A piece of one.
LEMUEL
Is it like hamburger?
NAN
It’s not cooked.
LEMUEL
What’s it like though? How big is
it?
NAN

Looks like...fibrous...I think it
had a tumor. It was hard.

LEMUEL
You touched it?

NAN
One was a tumor and one wasn’t.
With the forceps.
LEMUEL
Poke me where you think it feels
like.
Nan pokes his arm in a couple of places.

NAN
Kind a like that.

Lemuel pokes his own arm.
13

39.

NAN (CONT'D)
Raw steak. Kind of. Maybe like a
chicken steak.

LEMUEL
You're not a vegetarian, are you?

NAN
Most of the time. No cows.
BACK AT LUKE AND BRIE- LATER 13

Still sitting, Brie unloads her purse onto the table. She
produces a phone from deep inside its guts.

BRIE
We should call Leslie.

Luke holds a hand over his right eye like an eye-patch.

LUKE

Leslie?
Brie punches him.

BRIE
Yes.

LUKE
Why?

BRIE
Because she’s on a first date.

LUKE
Oh really?

BRIE

Yeah, she’s on a date with Average
Man. Have you met him?

LUKE
I don’t think so.

BRIE
He’s on the fifth floor. He’s a
lawyer. He’s nice and everything
but he’s totally ordinary so Leslie
and I call him Average Man.

LUKE
That doesn’t sound very good.
14

40.

BRIE
We should see if he becomes Above
Average Man on a date.

LUKE
Okay.

Brie gets out her phone and dials. Luke takes a sip of his
beer and looks around.

BRIE
Hey Leslie. . . How’s your date? .
. . Really? I assumed it was gonna
be bad since you picked up...
That's good. . . Is he buying you
average priced drinks? . . . Nice.

Luke stretches and works on his beer.

BRIE (CONT'D)

Is he right there? . . . Okay, I’1l
just ask yes and no questions. . .
Does he have man boobs?. . . Can

you see them?
Brie is amusing herself.
BRIE (CONT’D)
Has he mentioned his car more than
two times already? . . . Are you
gonna make him double bag it?

Brie looks at Luke but doesn’t make any indication of trying
to wrap it up.

Luke mimes out “I’m going to the bathroom”.

Brie nods.

INT. BAR BATHROOMS— CONTINUOUS 14

Luke walks into the bathroom and up to the only available
urinal out of two. Next to him stands CHAS.

CHAS
Hey.

LUKE
Hey.

Luke begins to pee.
15

41.

CHAS
Nice cock.

LUKE
What?

CHAS

Just kidding.

Chas zips up his pants and leaves the bathroom without
washing his hands.

Luke stands by himself, peeing. Running through the evening
in his mind.
INT. THE SCENE- SAME TIME 15

Brie is still talking on the phone.

BRIE
I’m hanging out with Luke. . . He
worked for the magazine. . . Yes
you do, he’s the “Supplies!” guy. .
. I know. . . Yeah, it’s fine.

Whatever.
Luke comes back and sits down.
BRIE (CONT’D)
Okay. I’11 talk to you later.
Bye.

Brie hangs up the phone and puts it back into her purse.

BRIE (CONT'D)

Sorry.
LUKE
Sure. How is she?
BRIE
Good. She says Average Man is a
gentleman.
LUKE

That’s good. Is he older?

BRIE
Not like way older but yeah.

LUKE
Well, go Average Man, go!
16

talking to each other.

BRIE
I’m kind of hungry. Are you
hungry?

LUKE
Yeah I could eat.

BRIE
Where can we go?

LUKE
There’s a pizza place nearby.
up the street I think.

BRIE
Is it good?

LUKE

42.

Just

Yeah. I mean, it’s pizza but it’s

good.

BRIE
Pizza sounds amazing.

LUKE
Let’s do it.

LUKE (CONT'D)
O-kay.

EXT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER

LUKE

Brie reaches over and downs the last sip of Luke’s beer.

16

Luke and Brie step outside of the bar to find a small
gathering of people out smoking or talking.

I’m not exactly sure which way it

is.

Luke walks over to them.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Hey man, where is that place?

Luke looks around and sees two guys, TALON and SPENCER
Talon is holding a TO-GO PIZZA BOX

Talon looks up and realizes Luke means the pizza.
TALON
It’s right down the street there.
Why, you want pizza?

LUKE
Yeah, I think we’re gonna get a
slice.

TALON

Dude, you can have some of this, we
can’t eat it all.

43.

Talon opens up the box to show a pristine Hawaiian Pizza.

LUKE
Oh thanks but I think we’re gonna
get our own.

TALON
Seriously man, we can’t eat it all.

LUKE
No thanks.

Spencer leans in and adds-

SPENCER
Dude, we can’t eat it all.

TALON
Come on. Eat it. It’s Hawaiian.

Luke looks to Brie, who shrugs.

LUKE
Okay.

BRIE
Thanks.

Luke and Brie reach in and grab a slice each. Talon
out his free hand.

TALON
I’m Talon. This is Spencer.

Everyone shakes.

BRIE
Nice to meet you. I’m Brie.

LUKE
Luke.

reaches
44,

TALON
Cool. Dig in.

BRIE
You're sure you don’t mind?

SPENCER
Dude, we can’t eat it all.

TALON
(to Luke)
What do you do?

LUKE
Um, nothing at the moment.

TALON
Really? Nothing?

LUKE
Yeah.

Brie and Spencer begin their own conversation.

BRIE
Where are you from Spencer?
SPENCER
Virginia Beach.
BRIE
Really? Is that nice?
SPENCER
I guess. Missy Elliott is from

there too.

While Talon talks to Luke, he tries to keep one ear on
Spencer and Brie’s conversation.

TALON
That’s cool. Have you ever heard
of Fulbright & Lewis?

LUKE
Is that the sofa company?

TALON
No, it’s a law firm. It’s the law
firm I work for.

LUKE
Oh cool.
17

45.

TALON
Yeah, they represent a lot of
celebrities, big civil cases. Like
Denzel Washington was just in our
office.

LUKE
They let you have that beard?

TALON
They let me do whatever the fuck I
want. I’m a genius.
(beat)
Are you guys going inside?

LUKE
Uh.
TALON
Come on, you guys need a drink. I’m
buying.
SPENCER
(to Talon)
You owe me like, two thousand
dollars.
BRIE
Okay.
INT. THE SCENE- LATER 17

Talon continues to tell Luke about his job while Spencer and
Brie talk about something else.

Two SUPER HOT GIRLS come up with their eyes on the pizza box.

SUPER HOTTIE #1
Hey. You guys have pizza?

Spencer and Talon immediately shift their focus to these new
friends.

TALON
Yeah dude, have a slice.

Luke looks at Brie and they silently agree to make a break
for it.

They slip off while the guys are distracted.

BRIE
Those guys were nice.
46.

LUKE
Yeah, you want to play pool?

BRIE
I’m terrible.

LUKE
Good. I’11 win then.

They make their way towards the pool table.

Luke puts some money in and racks the pool balls over the
following:

BRIE
Actually those guys remind me of
these models I used to live with.

LUKE
Those guys?

BRIE
Yeah. Just the way they talked and
acted. I don’t know, the demeanor.

LUKE
You lived with models?

BRIE
Mmm hmm. It was what I like to
refer to as a ‘quick-change’
atmosphere. It’s like theatre,
always changing outfits. Changing
zip codes, changing drugs. Changing
the people you’re friends with.
Everything. You go out to bars in
Beverly Hills and all the drinks
are paid for. It’s an interesting
way to live your life.

LUKE
Living through the kindness of
others.

BRIE

I don’t know if ‘kindness’ is the
word I'd use.

Luke breaks. He pauses. Considers the table.

LUKE
What do you think about that?
47.

BRIE
About what?

LUKE
About the fact that men are
supposed to buy the drinks? Don’t
you think they’re only buying
drinks to get you drunk?

BRIE
And not for the actual enjoyment of
buying someone a drink?

LUKE
Yeah.

Brie holds up her drink.

BRIE
Are you trying to get me drunk?

LUKE
No, but pizza guys might be.

BRIE
Listen. That’s the way it is. I
don’t mind some churlish guy buying
me a couple of vodka sodas. I don’t
have to go home with him. There’s
no contract I’m aware of. There’s
no body promise.

LUKE
Isn't that patronizing?

BRIE
I don’t think about people
patronizing me. It’s just a social
structure. A way of doing things
that’s accepted. ‘A’ leads to ‘B.’

LUKE
So ‘A’ is the initial contact?

BRIE
Sure. Then ‘B’ is the next drink
or the conversation or whatever
comes next.

LUKE
What happens when you get to ‘C’?
48.

BRIE
Well, if ‘C’ means me taking my
shirt off and barreling down on
some guy in the middle of the
bar...There doesn’t have to be a
‘C’. The ball is in my court.

LUKE
What if you make the initial
contact? Then by the time it gets
to ‘C’, the ball is in their court.

BRIE
No. Wrong. When it gets to ‘C’,
the ball is never in the guy’s
court.

LUKE
Oh really?

BRIE
Never. But here’s where the theory
fails: Marriage.

LUKE
Huh?

BRIE
Getting married...

LUKE
Wait, backtrack a second. How
often do you barrel down on some
guy in the middle of the bar?

BRIE
Fuck off. Get your mind out of the
gutter. How would you like it if
girls were always buying you drinks
and staring at your boobs while you
tried to have a conversation with
them?

This startles Luke. He can’t help but glance down at Brie’s
boobs.

BRIE (CONT’D)
You just looked at my boobs.

LUKE
I know! You said the word “boobs”
and it just happened. Sorry.
49.

BRIE
Well, see?

LUKE
I apologize.

BRIE

Think about every girl you know.
What if every relationship you had
with a member of the opposite sex
was based on the assumption that
they would fuck you if they got the
chance? Like, every time some guy
said he wanted to get a drink with
you or go for a walk, that that guy
is actually thinking: maybe I'll
have a chance with her tonight.
Maybe tonight will be the night she
gets drunk and wants to fuck me.

LUKE
That’s pretty dire.

BRIE
It is pretty fucking dire, if you
wanna know the truth. But wait:
marriage. Have you ever heard about
the Coolidge effect?

LUKE
No.

BRIE
Calvin Coolidge. Thirtieth
president of the United States.

1923 to...
(thinks)
1930.
LUKE
Bullshit.
BRIE

I told you. I’m not fucking around
with my presidential knowledge.

LUKE
Jeopardy’s gonna call you any day.

BRIE
But, so. Calvin Coolidge and his
wife...Grace...are taking separate
tours of a farm somewhere.

(MORE )
50.

BRIE (CONT'D)

Mrs. Coolidge is walking along and
she sees all these hens hopping
around and pecking at things and
Mrs. Coolidge says, “Man, that’s a
lot of hens. That’s a lot of work
for one old rooster.” The tour
guide says, “He’s fine, ma’am. The
rooster works very hard.” Then
Mrs. Coolidge says, “Really? He's
working hard every day?” “Oh
sure”, says the man. “Dozens of
times a day”. “Interesting!” says
Mrs. Coolidge. “You be sure to
tell that to the President!”

Brie catches a breath.

BRIE (CONT’D)
So later, Coolidge is walking along
with the same tour guide and he
passes the hens. The tour guide
tells him with Mrs. Coolidge said.
“Same hen every time?” he asks.
“Well, no”, says the guide. “It’s a
different one every time.”
Coolidge leans in to the guide and
smirks and says, “You tell that to
Mrs. Coolidge.”

LUKE
There’s a moral to this story.

BRIE
There is. And it’s that men are
hard-wired to spread their seed as
often as possible with as many
different partners as possible.

LUKE
Well, it makes sense, from an
evolutionary standpoint.

BRIE
No, it’s bullshit! They do these
experiments where they put one male
rat in a cage with ten female rats
and he fucks them all like crazy.
But then he gets tired and just
sleeps in the corner and the female
rats will nudge him and lick him
and stuff but he’s just not into it
anymore. Until they put a new
female in the mix and then all of a
sudden he’s horny as hell again.
18

19

20

51.

LUKE
Really?

BRIE
And they say that’s the Coolidge
Effect but really, they’ve done the
same thing with female rats and
they have the same reaction. It’s
not just a male thing. The real
moral is everybody gets tired of
fucking the same person after a
while.

EXT. LOS ANGELES- EVENING 18

City life continues while Luke and Brie are cooped up inside.

INT. THE SCENE- LATER 19

Luke and Brie are taking turns getting their picture taken.
Luke hops in, then Brie, then Luke again. He waits to see if
Brie will hop in for the last photo, but she doesn’t. He’s
left sitting there with an expectant look on his face.

LATER 20
Luke and Brie wait for the photos to come out.

LUKE
You didn’t play anything?

BRIE
I played tennis in high school.

LUKE
Not a good experience?

BRIE
No. It was fine. My friends all
played field hockey and I didn’t
feel like getting pummeled with
sticks. This girl I knew named
Sarah Neaves, she was always
showing up in the mornings with a
black eye.

LUKE
Poor Sarah Neaves.
52.

BRIE
Yeah. She was really athletic
though. All the guys called her
Steve Neaves.

LUKE
Oh my god. I’m surprised they had
the nerve, those field hockey girls
will fuck you up.

BRIE
Did you have a run in with a field
hockey player?

LUKE
I dated one.

BRIE
That counts.

LUKE
Yeah. My first girlfriend played
field hockey for the rival high
school. I used to go to her games.

BRIE
How old were you? Your first
girlfriend?
LUKE
Um. Fifteen.
BRIE
That’s a good age. Did you do it?
LUKE
Excuse me?
BRIE

With her? Did you all “get it on”?
I'm always asking people when they
lost their virginity, I hope you
don’t mind.

LUKE
When did you first have sex?

BRIE
Far too young.
53.

LUKE

Well, this girl was a field hockey
player, but she didn’t start
playing until six months after we
started going out. She tried out
on a lark: I remember being like,
‘You're gonna do what?’

(beat)
We weren’t very sporty the two of
us. But she liked it. She went to
practice all the time. It is nice
to watch girls in skirts beating
the hell out of each other on a
spring afternoon.

BRIE

Hot. Idyllic.
LUKE

And guess what she’s doing now?
BRIE

Coke.
LUKE

Oh, nice. No, she’s a cop.
BRIE

No way.
LUKE

I'm telling the truth. We used to
sit around and smoke pot and she’d
talk about wanting to join the FBI.
But now she’s really a cop in my
hometown. Whenever I go to see my
parents I have these fantasies of
driving real fast and then getting
pulled over and then there she is.

Brie looks at him questioningly.

BRIE
There’s a male fantasy for you.
Right there. Positions of
authority.

LUKE
No, it’s not like that. I’d just
like to see her again. It’s been...
six or so years since I’ve seen
her.
54.

BRIE
What happened?
LUKE
You mean, why did we break up?
BRIE
Sure.
LUKE
We were in tenth grade. We broke
up.
BRIE

You never said if you had sex.

LUKE
Didn't I?

Brie shakes her head.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Huh.

Luke finishes off his beer.

He smiles.

BRIE
Party pooper.

BRIE (CONT’D)
Speaking of. I really should get
going.

LUKE
Oh, right. To meet your friends.

BRIE
Yeah, it’s my girlfriend’s birthday
and I have to at least make an
appearance.

LUKE
Okay.

BRIE
And I'd better get there before she
passes out.

LUKE
Oh really? She’s one of those
girls?
55.

BRIE
Well, no, she’s not like a drunk or
a sorority girl or anything. But
when it’s her birthday she'll let
herself loose, you know?

LUKE
Sure.

BRIE
So.

Brie finishes off her drink.

LUKE BRIE
Then I guess I’d better be... Do you want to come along?
LUKE BRIE
What? What?
LUKE
Oh, to the party?
BRIE
Yeah.
LUKE
Go to the party?
BRIE
Yeah.
LUKE

Um. Do you think it’1ll be weird, I
mean is it just a bunch of good
friends?

BRIE
No, it’1ll be fine.

LUKE
Okay then. If you think so.

BRIE
You'll be alright.

Brie leads the way as they head out of the bar.

LUKE
Where is it?

BRIE
Highland Park kind of.
56.

21 EXT. THE SCENE - MINUTES LATER 21

Luke and Brie walk outside of the bar.

LUKE
Should I just follow you?
BRIE
Yes. It’s off Riverside, but just
follow me.
LUKE
Okay.
22 INT. LUKE’S CAR - NIGHT 22

Luke drives and talks on the phone to Colin. He’s wearing
glasses.

LUKE
Dude, I am rubbing two sticks
together out here.

COLIN (0.S.)
Is she flirting with you?

LUKE
I don’t know. She’s talking to me.

COLIN (0.S.)
Is she checking her watch all the
time though?

LUKE
No, it’s nothing obvious. She’s
just giving me mixed signals, man.

COLIN (0.S.)
That’s what women do.

LUKE
I mean, it’s fun but what the fuck
am I supposed to do? I suck at
dates.

Still driving, Luke rummages around in the side panel of his
car.

LUKE (CONT'D)

Actually, I don’t even know if it

is a date. Midway through, she

said we should call this girl

Leslie because she is on a date.
(MORE )
57.

LUKE (CONT'D)

And she kept saying the word,
“date”, really casually, like what
we were doing was something totally
different.

COLIN (0.S.)

LUKE
But she invited me to the party, so
that’s something right?

COLIN (0.S.)
Yeah.

LUKE
I just have no clue.

COLIN (0.S.)

Listen. You'd rather be out with a
girl going to some random party,
then over here at my house playing
Guitar Hero, right?

He pulls out a bowl that’s already half-filled with pot.

LUKE
I don’t know any of these people.

COLIN (0.S.)

That’s why you’re perfectly safe,
then. They don’t know you. No harm
no foul. You can pretty much burn
the house down and emerge
unscathed.

LUKE
Yeah.

Still driving, and talking on the phone, Luke sparks up.

COLIN (0.S.)
Is she cool?

LUKE
Christ. She’s gorgeous. And smart.
She’s way smarter than me, man. I’m
not trying to cast any undue
aspersions here, but she’s sharp as
a tack.

COLIN (0.S.)
See. There you go.
23

24

25

26

58.

LUKE
And she might be a little mean. I
like a woman who could beat me up
though.

COLIN (0.S.)
How’s the rack?

LUKE
Good. I think. I mean, fine. Wanna
hear something weird?
(beat)
When she smiles I kinda want to
break down in tears. That’s weird,
right?

COLIN (0.S.)
No, that’s gay.
INT. BRIE’S CAR- SAME TIME 23

Brie drives and occasionally checks her hair and make up in
the rear view mirror.

She also checks on Luke and can see him chatting vivaciously
on his phone.
EXT. MEADOWVALE AVE.- NIGHT 24

Brie parks but Luke has to drive around a bit more to find an
empty spot.

Finally he finds one and he parks his car. It has a dent the
side of the door. It is quite dirty.

INT. LUKE’S CAR - NIGHT 25
He puts the car in park and composes himself.

He pulls an INHALER out of the same side panel he got the
bowl from and takes a big puff. He puts it back in the box
with his glasses. He’s hitting his stride now.

EXT. MEADOWVALE AVE.- CONTINUOUS 26

Luke walks up the street towards the sound of the party.
Brie stands by the front waiting for him.

BRIE
You've gotta meet my friend Dickie?
27

59.
LUKE
Dickie?
BRIE
Yeah, he’s an amazing writer. Like

actually brilliant.

LUKE
Okay.

They walk up to the party, which seems to be taking place as
much outside of the house as inside it.
EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 27

CAMERON, a bubbly young female, is doing cartwheels in the
yard for a crowd. Luke stops to notice her.

Cameron looks up a notices Brie.

CAMERON
Brie! Ahhh!

She runs over and hugs Brie.

BRIE
Hey, happy birthday slut.
CAMERON
Thanks.
BRIE

This is my friend Luke Putnam.
Luke extends his hand.

LUKE
Hey.

CAMERON
Hi, Luke Putnam.

BRIE
What’s going on?

CAMERON
Nothing. Come on back. Drink some
jack and coke.

BRIE
Where’s Dickie? Is he here?
28

29

60.

CAMERON
Yeah. He’s somewhere.

Brie scampers off and Luke begins to follow but Cameron keeps
him around.

CAMERON (CONT’D)
Do you want beer? Because the keg
is in the back back but we have
vodka and whiskey and spooky punch
in the kitchen.

LUKE
Spooky punch?

CAMERON
Yeah, it’s my secret recipe. It’s
supposed to be for Halloween but
it’ll get you drunk quick so I made
some anyway.

LUKE
Well I want to try some of that. I
want to see what’s so spooky about
it.

CAMERON

Ok, come on.
INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 28
Luke walks around, holding a glass of spooky punch. There
are people all around, none of whom he knows. Nobody notices
him.
He sees Brie talking to DICKIE (20s) in the corner of the
living room. He opts not to interrupt.

INT. PARTY - NIGHT 29

Luke wanders around the house. He watches people warily. He
inspects the books or whatever happens to be lying around.

NEARBY

GAIL and HILARY and IAN are talking about wildlife
encounters.

GAIL
We've got this possum in our yard.
30

EXT.

Luke
game

Brie

61.

HILARY
Eeek. They’re so scary. Those
tails...they’re like giant rats.

IAN
I’1ll trade you your possum for my
skunk.

GAIL
No!

IAN

I’m not kidding. He’s been in our
yard for the last two nights.

HILARY
You don’t want to fuck with a
skunk.

IAN

I waved this broom at him. He was
crouching over by the fence. He
just hissed at me and ran off.

HILARY
What are you going to do?

IAN
He bared his damn teeth at me.

GAIL
He’s like This is my yard, bitch!

HILARY
This is terrible. I hit a skunk
with my car. Right after I first
moved here. He just ran out in the
road and I clipped him with like,
my back wheel. The trunk of my car
almost melted off. I had to drive
with the windows down for three
days.

PARTY - NIGHT 30

is back outside, watching and cheering on strangers in a
of beer pong.

comes up to Luke, out of the crowd.
62.

BRIE
So... If Cameron asks you a
question, you need to answer yes.
Okay?

LUKE

Um. Okay. What question? What am I
answering yes to?

BRIE
Just if she asks you anything.

LUKE
I saw her by that bush over there.
I think she lost an earring.

BRIE
She’s fine. She found it.
LUKE
So the answer is yes?
BRIE
Yup.
LUKE
What did you do? Did you do
something?
BRIE
No. I told her we had sex over
there
(points)
And that we did it for five
minutes.
LUKE
Where?
(points)

In the hammock? Five minutes?

BRIE
(nodding)
It was magical.

LUKE
I think I can do that.

BRIE
Now come meet Dickie.
31

63.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 31

In the kitchen, DICKIE (20's) is holding court. GIRLS and a
guy or two stand around him. Brie makes her way through the
room with Luke trailing behind her.

DICKIE
You want to know what the problem
is? I stopped reading books. For
two weeks now I haven’t read a
thing. I haven’t had any time to
myself at all. My attention span is
fucked. I can’t concentrate, my
vocabulary is getting worse...

He spots Brie.

DICKIE (CONT'D)
Hey again.

BRIE
I want you to meet my friend Luke.

DICKIE
Hey Luke.

They shake hands.

DICKIE (CONT'D)
You friends with Cameron?

LUKE
I just met her out front, actually.
She was doing cartwheels.

DICKIE
She should be. You only turn
eighteen once, right?

LUKE
She's eighteen?

DICKIE
No. There would be a lot of people
in jail tonight if she was just
turning eighteen.

BRIE
(raising her hand)
I’m one of them.

DICKIE
(to Luke)
Having fun?
64.

LUKE
Yeah. I just got here.

BRIE
I found him on the side of the
road. He looked lonely. He told me
he was tired from selling his body
all the time.

DICKIE
It’s a tough racket.

LUKE
Those streets are cold, man.

Luke expects a laugh that doesn’t come.

BRIE
Dickie is the most amazing writer.

LUKE DICKIE
So I hear. Oh my God...

BRIE (CONT'D)

No he seriously is. You two would
get along. You could talk and talk
about books.

DICKIE
Are you a writer?
LUKE’ BRIE
Well, right now I’m working Luke is taking time off. He
on... just quit his job to work on
a piece.

DICKIE (CONT'D)
That's fantastic. So you’re
unemployed?

LUKE
I’m working on my own stuff right
now.

DICKIE
What? Journalism? Screenplays?
Everybody out here seems to be
secreting screenplays.

LUKE
Yeah, no. I’m working on a long
piece for the Los Angeles Times.
65.

DICKIE

Oh, do you know Dean Baquet?
LUKE

Who?
DICKIE

He’s the Editor-In-Chief. Last time
I checked. He’s an amazing man.
Just came in from New York and took
the reins. Amazing man. They
treated him like shit in New York.

LUKE
I don’t know him. I’m working with
Karen Middleton in the Sunday
section.

DICKIE
That’s great. One of those big
Sunday features.

LUKE
That’s what I’m hoping for.
BRIE
(to Luke)
Do you know Stanford University?
LUKE BRIE
Sure. I know it. Dickie just finished his

fellowship there.

LUKE
Really? The Graduate Program?
DICKIE
The Stegner.
LUKE
No way.
BRIE

They paid his whole way for two
years. I told you. He’s a brilliant
writer.

DICKIE
(to Brie)
Are you trying to hook us up?

BRIE
I’m just saying!
66.

DICKIE
(to Luke)
It was a cool program. Tobias
Wolff. Amazing man.

LUKE
I love his work. I applied there
last year but I guess they weren’t
having it.

DICKIE
Ah. Fuck ‘em. I mean, you know, the
competition is so fucking fierce
for what? Like twelve places?

LUKE
I didn’t apply to the Stegner
thing. Just for the journalism
department.

DICKIE
Well they’re obviously idiots. Go
back to ‘em next year with your
Times feature. They’1l be
drooling. By that time, you’1ll have
done a bunch of work and you won’t
even want to bother with school.

LUKE
(to Brie and Dickie)
How long have you guys known each
other?

DICKIE
Centuries. What was it? The Boer
War?

BRIE
We used to be roommates. The House
of Clothes.

DICKIE
Yeah. What a mess that was.
(to Brie)
You know I saw Stephanie recently.
She made the cover of...Italian
Vogue I think? She seemed like she
was doing well.

LUKE
(to Dickie)
So you lived with all those models?
32

67.

DICKIE

On and off. They were kind enough
to give me a couch for awhile and
then Stephanie...she’s the
successful one...had to go to Milan
or something...so I just subletted
her room for what turned out to be
the better part of like, a year and

a half.

BRIE
I’m so glad I don’t live there
anymore.

DICKIE

Yeah. It was rough. All those
models prancing around in their
underwear. Pillow-fighting. I
swear. It was like something you
read about.

BRIE
I don’t know, it seemed pretty
normal at the time.

DICKIE
Not this one though.
(points to Brie)
In her room with the door shut and
her nose in a book.

BRIE
Ha. Not always.
DICKIE
(smiling)
Not always.

Dickie and Brie both laugh.

LUKE
Where’s the bathroom around here?

Luke slides away to find the bathroom.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 32

CAMERON finds Luke sitting on the couch, watching people,
drinking beer from a red plastic cup.

CAMERON
Putnam.
68.

LUKE
Yes?

CAMERON
Hi.
Cameron sits down on the couch. She makes whoever was sitting
down get up.

CAMERON (CONT'D)
It’s my birthday.

LUKE
I heard. How old are you?

CAMERON
You’re not supposed to ask a lady
her age.

LUKE

You set me up for it. But if you
want to tell somebody your true
age, it might as well be me since I
don’t know anyone else here.

CAMERON
Guess.

LUKE
I’m not guessing. That is the road
to peril.

Cameron leans in to Luke, uncomfortably close. He might scoot
back a bit into the couch.

CAMERON
You have to guess.

LUKE
You have to tell me.
(beat)
Here. Whisper it into my ear.
Cameron whispers something inaudible in Luke’s ear.

LUKE (CONT'D)
She told you that huh?

Cameron nods. Luke grimaces.

LUKE (CONT'D)
That’s nice of her.
69.

CAMERON
I’m just kidding. She didn’t say
that. You got kind of surly.
That’s cute.

LUKE
Surly is cute?

CAMERON
Have you played beer battleship?

LUKE
No, but I saw a bit. I think I
might come out there in a minute.

CAMERON
You should. It’s amazing.

LUKE
Okay.

ELSEWHERE

EDIE and FEROCIOUS stand in a corner. Ferocious is acting
out his name on the air guitar.

EDIE
You look retarded when you play air
guitar.

FEROCIOUS

I don’t care. I’m gifted.
EDIE

No. I mean it. I’m going to punch
you in the arm.

33 EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 33
Luke and Brie sit outside.

LUKE
You can mingle if you want.

BRIE
No, I did. It’s fine.

LUKE
You don’t have to entertain me.

BRIE
Good, because I left my spinning
plates at home.
Pause.

70.

LUKE
Whenever I go to parties, I usually
just wind up talking with the one
person I came with.

BRIE
Everybody does that.

LUKE
I usually just sit around and watch
people. I’m pretty shy, usually.

BRIE
You’re not shy. You’re the least
shy person I’ve ever met.

LUKE
No. I am in certain situations.
Parties aren’t really my forte.

BRIE
Well, Cameron likes you.

LUKE
That's cool. My confidence points
are increasing.

PARTYGOER
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE SPACE
PROGRAM!

BRIE

Maybe if you're lucky, you'll get
throw-up on your shoes.

Luke
They're pretty serious here.

BRIE
Got a lot of steam to let off.

BRIE (CONT'D)
I know this girl who’s a stand-up
comedian. Totally frightening,
right? She feeds off getting up at
open mic nights and telling jokes,
but when you get her in a party
atmosphere or regular social
situations, she’s just terrified.
71.

LUKE
Yeah. You’re supposed to get
outdoors and meet new people,
right? So now I have a compulsion
to get out of the house and into
new situations. Like maybe there’s
a whole echelon of people I’m
missing out on being with. I think
I'd just like to be better socially

adjusted.
BRIE
I was an insomniac, did I tell you
that?
LUKE
No.
BRIE

Well, I grew up in this really
small town called Dracut and I was
too young to have my own car or
anything and try to make out to
Boston or Lowell or wherever and do
fun things. And I had the worst
time sleeping. The whole house
would be asleep and I couldn’t even
get up and walk around or anything
because I was afraid of waking up
my sister.

(She actually smiles a

little at the following: )
So I'd sit there and stare at the
ceiling and imagine all the fun
things that were happening without
me.

LUKE
Were you ever popular?

BRIE
Yeah. In High School. And
college. I mean, you know. I had
friends. But I had a real awkward
period first. Do you remember when
parties used to be the highlight of
your week? Or at least they were
something that you looked forward
to.

LUKE
Like a county fair in the summer.
72.

BRIE
Exactly. They were unique. Maybe
because we just hadn’t been to so
many. They were still a new
experience. You know...
(eyebrows raised)
.--dancing with boys.

LUKE
Oh God. I hated dancing.
(beat)
Agh. See, I’m having flashbacks.

Luke holds his hands out like a zombie, except that his hands
are turned like he’s holding a phantom dancer. Brie smiles.
He puts his arms down.

LUKE (CONT'D)

This may sound stupid, but maybe
you can help me out with this
thought I’ve been having. I worry
sometimes that what I’m
experiencing won’t be enough. In
the long run. That I’m putting all
my money in this one
bank...or...no...that I’m reading
this one newspaper. And then, one
day, come to find out that this
newspaper is wrong. That it’s been
reporting the wrong news. I’ve been
reading about things never really
happened. Or that happened slightly
different than reported.

BRIE
But if you never find out then it’s
all real news to you.

LUKE
But what happens when the curtain
is suddenly pulled back?

BRIE
Why did you move here?

LUKE
I don’t know. It rained a lot in
Knoxville. We were in the
mountains. When I got out here, it
hadn’t rained in six months. I
thought: this is the place for me
for now. But now I just miss the
rain. I miss having the option of
bad weather.
Pause.

73.

BRIE
That’s it? You moved out here for
the sunshine? That’s pretty
generic.

LUKE
But it’s a good reason. You lived
in a small town. You should know.
All I ever wanted to do was be
somewhere else.

BRIE
Yeah. I know about that. But you
can’t just move for the sake of

moving.

LUKE
I could do stories all over the
world.

BRIE

Do you worry about what people are
thinking about?

LUKE
Worry how? What people are
thinking about me?

BRIE
Sure.

LUKE
I don’t know that it worries me.
But I might get upset if some guy
was talking shit about my haircut
behind my back. Say, if this guy
was my best friend. I might find
that a little unsettling.

BRIE
I worry about people’s priorities.

LUKE
What do you mean?

BRIE
Like what do people really want?
I’m a secretary. You’re an intern.
Cameron is a bartender. We've all
been out of college for a while.
Our priorities are becoming more
streamlined.

(MORE )
74.

BRIE (CONT'D)
Why isn’t anybody really going
after something and putting us all
to shame? I mean, aside from
Dickie, who is amazing and driven,
I don’t think anyone knows what's

next.

LUKE
I feel like I’m going after
something.

BRIE
I mean, I guess we all are. But
not really.

LUKE

Maybe you aren’t, but don’t lump me
in with your slacker friends.

Brie looks at Luke for a long second.

BRIE
You’re twenty-what? Seven? You’re
not married. You think you can be
single and drift. Write your pieces
here and there and do what you

want.
LUKE
And you can’t?
BRIE
I can do whatever I goddamn well

please.

Brie is moving off into her own world. Luke is trying to keep
up, but foundering. He tries to interject when he can, but he
never quite manages to get a word in.

LUKE
But you’re not the only one.

BRIE
(sharply)
I know I’m not. I know I’m not the
only person on the planet. And I’m
sorry for assuming and using you as
an example but I think you know
what I’m saying.

LUKE
But you shouldn’t worry about other
people too much.

(MORE )
75.

LUKE (CONT'D)
It’s like if you let everyone at
the grocery store cut in front of
you in line. You’d never get to the
cash register.

BRIE

No. That’s stupid. It’s not like
that. But I see it when I go home
and see my sister and my cousins
and they're all married and have
kids and they look at me like...

(beat)
...No. It’s not something that
isn’t forced upon me all the time:
I’ve watched my little nieces
growing up and now they’re like ten
years old and playing sports in
school. And taking gymnastics.
My sister’s taken a completely
different path than me. But she’s
completely clueless. And it’s just
going to get worse as I get older.
No one has any idea that doing what
you want actually makes you happy
in the end.

LUKE
That sucks.

BRIE
Don’t try and sympathize with me.
It’s not like it’s something you’1l
ever have to deal with.

LUKE
(quickly, defensively)
I'm just trying to be agreeable.

BRIE
Well, it’s pretty fucking
disagreeable.

LUKE

I don’t know what to say then.
She gets up.

BRIE
I’m going to get a beer.

Luke has nothing to say to this. He moves around in the
backyard for a second and spots DARREN talking on the phone
34

76.

DARREN

Hey. What’s going on?

(beat)
I was wondering, they turned the
shower off at my place and I was
wondering if I could come over and
use yours

(beat)
It's like twelve-forty...

(hopefully: )
I'll bring my own towel.

Luke looks around at the other PARTYGOERS. The party is
dying down a bit.

INT. PARTY HOUSE- MINUTES LATER 34
Luke walks through the party and doesn’t see Brie.

GEANNIE, a girl, approaches Luke.

GEANNIE
I know you, man.

LUKE
Yeah?

Geannie grabs her friend, SAMANTHA, and points to Luke.

GEANNIE
This is amazing. This guy is Harry
Nilsson.

SAMANTHA

Who the hell is Harry Nilsson?
GEANNIE

Lime in the coconut, she drank ‘em

both up. Lime in the coconut.

SAMANTHA
Agh. I hate that song.

GEANNIE
This guy looks just like him.

LUKE
Thanks. Really, I mean it. That
might have just made my night.
Luke walks on and sees Brie, back with Dickie.

He walks over to them.
77.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Hey, I think I’m gonna take off.

Brie looks at him funny. Dickie extends his hand out.

DICKIE
Cool man, it was great meeting you.

LUKE
Yeah. You too.

DICKIE
I’ll keep an eye out for your stuff
in the L.A. Times.

LUKE
Yeah.

DICKIE
Wait, do you have any interest in
like, narrative stuff? Any
fiction?

LUKE
Why?

DICKIE
Me and a bunch of people have this
writing group. It’s just a bunch
of jerks but you get some good
feedback and a place to hear your
stuff out loud. We’re always
looking for more people. Would you
be interested?

LUKE

Uh, yeah, maybe actually.
BRIE
(to Dickie)

How come you’ve never invited me
into the writing group?

DICKIE
Haven't I? You can join. We need
some more females in there.

BRIE
What do you have to do?

DICKIE
Just write something and send it to
everyone and then they read it and
talk about it at the meeting.
35

78.

BRIE
Sounds intimidating.

DICKIE
It’s chill. It’s usually at my
house and my roommate makes these
badass sugar cookies.

LUKE
I like sugar cookies.

DICKIE
Seriously, I’m sure you’d fit right
in.

LUKE
Cool. Brie’s got my number.

Luke leans towards the door overexaggerating his gesture to
leave hoping Brie will call him back.

She bites.
BRIE
(to Luke)
I’m gonna have one more cigarette.
Do you want one?

LUKE
Oh. Okay.

DICKIE
Those give you cancer you know?

BRIE
So do sugar cookies.

DICKIE
Harsh.

Brie gives him a wave.

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - LATER 35
Luke and Brie come back to the spot where they had their
fight. Luke is carrying two beers for them and Brie is
grabbing cigarettes out of her purse.

She hands him a cigarette and lights her own. She lights his
for him and he hand her a beer.

They both exhale a drag in silence.
79.

LUKE
Listen, I’m sorry if I said
something dumb before.

BRIE
No, I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean
to run you off. Just a sore
subject I guess.

LUKE
No, I understand.
BRIE
(soft)
Thanks.

Brie extends her bottle to Luke and he CLANKS his against it.

BRIE (CONT’D)
Cheers.

They sip their drinks and smoke their cigarettes.

LUKE
Did I tell you I can play mouth
trumpet?

BRIE

Oh God. Let’s hear it. What songs
do you play? What’s your
repertoire? All Iron Maiden?

LUKE

For real? You wanna hear it?
BRIE

Yes.
LUKE

Do you have any requests?

BRIE
You're just stalling.

LUKE
Okay okay, hold on.

Luke licks his lips. “Prepares.” Then he blows his way
through the trumpet melody of “The Light” by Rand and
Holland. Complete with pauses where the other instruments
would be filling in the gaps.

He finishes and shoots her a slightly impudent look.
80.

BRIE
That’s not half as bad as I thought
it would be.

LUKE
Thank you. I also do a mean mouth
bass.

BRIE

Upright or electric?

LUKE
It comes off mostly as upright.

BRIE
Swell.

Luke inspects his beer.

LUKE
I think we drank a lot.

Brie edges away. Looks up and around. Whatever spell the two
of them might have been under is broken.

BRIE
I gotta go. I’ve gotta work
tomorrow.

Luke grimaces. He didn’t want to end the night on “mouth
trumpet”.

LUKE
Work is for suckers.

Brie stands up. Luke follows.
BRIE
Yeah. Somebody’s got to hold that
building up.
They begin walking towards the front.

LUKE
Should we say bye to Cameron?

BRIE
I doubt she’s coherent.

Cameron stands in the doorway that they pass on their way
out.

CAMERON
HEY! Luke! Right? Luke?
81.

LUKE
Yeah.
CAMERON
There’s something I was supposed to
ask you.
LUKE
Yes.
CAMERON
What is it?
LUKE
The answer is yes. And it was

magical.

Cameron laughs. Who knows why.

BRIE

Bye babe. We’re taking off.
CAMERON

Bye. Thanks for coming.
LUKE

Nice meeting you.
CAMERON

You too. It was magical.
LUKE

(points to her)

Magical.

Luke and Brie finally exit to the front.

36 EXT. MEADOWVALE AVE.- CONTINUOUS 36

Luke and Brie walk down the dark street with the sounds of
the party fading behind them.

Luke walks slowly, defeated by the pressure surrounding the
next few moments. Brie seems cool as a cucumber.

BRIE
Cameron really likes you.

Luke smiles.

LUKE
She’s got good taste.
82.

BRIE
My God. You are cocky when you’re
drunk.

LUKE
Maybe I see myself through beer
goggles.

BRIE

Did you park close by?

LUKE
I think so. I’m down...
(looks around, locates
himself)
that street. But I’1ll walk you to
your car.

BRIE
Thanks.

LUKE
Unless it’s further away than mine.

BRIE
Ruthless.

LUKE
Pragmatic.

They walk in mostly silence, taking in the night.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Are you gonna be okay to drive?

BRIE
Yeah. I don’t live far.

LUKE
Okay.

They reach Brie’s car and she pauses for a moment by her
door. This is the moment.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Do you want to drive me to my car?

Brie looks at him. The moment is put off for now.

BRIE
Okay, Lazy Bones Jones.

She unlocks the doors and moves some shit off the passenger
seat for him to sit.
83.

37 INT. BRIE’S CAR- CONTINUOUS 37

Luke sits in the passenger seat as Brie gets situated and
drives slowly down the street.

LUKE

What’s your middle initial?
BRIE

Why?
LUKE

I bet I can guess your middle name
from just the initial. It’s a gift

I have.
BRIE
E.
LUKE
Okay, give me three guesses.
BRIE
Okay.
LUKE
Okay. Elizabeth? Eleanor?
Eumpelstiltskin?
BRIE
Yup. Brie Eumpulstiltskin Sampson.
LUKE
It’s a gift.
BRIE
No, you got it. It’s Elizabeth.
LUKE
First guess.
BRIE
What’s yours?
LUKE
Alexander.
BRIE

I meant your initial! You didn’t
let me guess!

LUKE
Oh, sorry. I didn’t know you had
the gift too.
84.

BRIE
Alexander would have been my first
guess from A.

LUKE
Sure.

Luke points.

LUKE (CONT'D)
It’s up here on the right.

BRIE
Here?

LUKE
Yeah, you can pull over. It’s the
Accord there. Yeah, that bad boy
right there.

BRIE
So that’s your game show car?
LUKE
Yeah.
BRIE
Nice dent.
LUKE
Thank you.
BRIE

Is there a good story that goes
along with that dent?

LUKE
No. I woke up one morning and there
it was.

BRIE
A late night dent and run?

LUKE
It was. The mystery remains
unsolved...

BRIE
Yeah...

Luke takes off his seatbelt and looks at Brie.

LUKE
Well.
38

39

85.

BRIE
Well.
LUKE
Thanks for driving me to my car.
BRIE
Sure.
LUKE
And thanks for hanging out, it was
fun.
BRIE
It was.

This is the moment. Luke nods and opens his door.

LUKE
See you later.

BRIE
Bye.

Luke begins to get out of the car but freezes midway through.
He looks back to see Brie watching him leave. He’s suddenly
feeling an urge to kiss her but he’s frozen in an awkward
hover. Just to end it, he climbs fully out of the car and
closes the door behind him.

He puts his hand up as one last parting shot and she salutes
him back.

And then she drives away.

EXT. STREET— CONTINUOUS 38
Luke watches her car while he unlocks the door to his own.
He opens the door and gets inside.

INT. LUKE’S CAR- CONTINUOUS 39
Luke sits in the driver seat, staring ahead.

LUKE
You sir, are an idiot. You fuck.

He quickly punches the ceiling of the car and quickly regrets
it.
40

86.

He reaches into the glove compartment and pulls out his
glasses and puts them on.

He turns the key in the ignition and turns on the radio.
After maybe five beats of the song, he turns it right back

off and reaches into his pocket.
He pulls out his phone and dials a number.

After two rings, Brie picks up.

CUT BETWEEN:

INT. LUKE’S CAR- NIGHT & INT. BRIE’S CAR- SAME TIME 40
BRIE
Hello?
LUKE

Hey. What’s up?

BRIE
I'm driving.

Luke pulls out of his parking spot and begins driving down
the street in the same direction Brie left.

A beat.

LUKE
Cool.

LUKE (CONT’D)

Well, I’m kind of notorious for
missing golden opportunities and
maybe I’m crazy but I think that
you wanted me to kiss you back
there. Am I stupid or did I miss a
golden opportunity?

BRIE
(repeating for
clarification)
Are you stupid or did you miss a
golden opportunity?

LUKE
Yeah.

BRIE
I think you missed a golden
opportunity.
4l

42

87.

LUKE
Oh no. So I guess I’m stupid
either way.

BRIE
Well, what are you gonna do about
it?

LUKE

Um, where are you?

BRIE
I’m on Figueroa and 45th.

LUKE
Well I’m on Figueroa and 37th. Do
you want to meet at Figueroa and
41st.

BRIE
Okay.

LUKE
Okay. See you in a second.

Luke hangs up and can’t contain his high. He turns the music
up loud.
EXT. FIGUEROA & 41ST- MINUTES LATER 4l

Luke pulls his car to the side of the road and gets out. He
looks around but doesn’t see Brie’s car.

After a moment, Brie’s car turns the corner at the other end
of the street and pulls over.

Luke walks briskly to where she is. He gets to her car,
opens the door and gets in.
INT. BRIE’S CAR- CONTINUOUS 42

Before either has a chance to say anything, they embrace in a
long, drunk kiss.

Luke pulls away and clears his throat a little.

LUKE
Sorry about the unconventional. ..

Brie takes off his glasses and tosses them in the back seat.
43

44

88.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Hey now.

BRIE
Where did those come from?

LUKE
Lenscrafters I think.

BRIE
You’re so lame.

They kiss again. The kind of kiss that might lead to
something else if the awkward positioning of the two car
seats weren’t in the way.

EXT. LOS ANGELES- NIGHT 43

The city is cool. Calm. Quiet.

INT. BRIE’S CAR- LATER 44

Brie and Luke are kissing. Luke has his hand on the door
handle.

BRIE
You have your hand on the door
handle.

LUKE

I know. Sorry.

BRIE
In a rush?

LUKE
You're the one that has to work.

BRIE
That’s true. Get out.

LUKE
Okay.

He gives her another quick kiss.

LUKE (CONT'D)
Thanks for making out.

Brie gives him a look. Luke counters quickly.
45

89.

LUKE (CONT'D)
I meant to say ‘hanging out’.
(beat)
That's embarrassing.

BRIE

You too. Thanks for making out.
LUKE

Alright. I’11l see you later.
BRIE

Goodbye.
LUKE

Bye.

Luke reaches into the backseat and pulls out his glasses. He
puts them on and overexaggerates pushing them up on his nose.

He smiles at her and gets out of the car.

Brie watches him leave. And cracks a smile.

EXT. FIGUEROA & 41ST - CONTINUOUS 45

Luke begins to walk back to his car with a swagger. He turns
and gives one last wave to Brie as she drives off.

He walks briskly. And cracks a smile.

THE END
