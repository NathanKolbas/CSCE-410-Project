EXT: 7TH AVE & 34TH ST, NYC - WINTER - DUSK

Snow and ice with big chill winds hit the streets but it
doesn’t slow down the throngs of New Yorkers heading
toward the Long Island Railroad entrance of PENN STATION.
The Camera settles on ONE MAN walking alone fighting the
crowds and the weather. We meet JACKIE BURKE.

INT: ESCALATOR - LIR - PENN STATION - DUSK

Jackie, carrying a small sports bag, rides the escalator
down into Penn Station, stoic, oblivious to the harried
commuters around him.

INT. LONG ISLAND RAIL ROAD TRAIN - LATER - DAY

Jackie sits alone on the train. He reads the NY Times,
every once in a while circling an item, scribbling notes.

An MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN across from him stares. Jackie
offers a brief glimpse then turns away.

OLD WOMAN
Excuse me? I know you... Don’t
I know you?

JACKIE

No!
Jackie returns to his notes. The Old Woman, speechless,
goes back to minding her own business.
EXT: LIR HICKSVILLE STATION SIGN - DAY

The train pulls into Hicksville, Long Island.

EXT. GOVERNOR’S COMEDY CLUB - RAINY - LATE AFTERNOON

A “Long Island Taxi” drives through a suburban shopping
mall parking lot behind Petco, P.C. Richards, Staples,

bringing us to two small, isolated buildings: A tiny

drive-thru “Dairy Mart”, and a red cement-block bunker

with the word “COMEDY” printed across the front.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Jackie glances at the Marquee through the window...

NOSTALGIA NITE! !

Starring
BRETT BUTLER from “GRACE UNDER FIRE” *
JACKIE BURKE from “Eddie’s Place” *
Hosted by
JIMMIE “DYNOMITE” WALKER *

Jackie, expressionless, wraps his scarf around his neck
and reads the computer screen: cash or credit.

CABBIE
(in rear-view mirror)
I knew I knew you. “Eddie”. You’re
“Eddie”. My wife and I were just
watching one of the old shows. She
said you died. I says, no I think

he’s alive. We had a fight. *

Jackie throws the driver a $20 and exits the cab. *

He runs through the pouring rain to the front door. *

INT. GOVERNOR’ S COMEDY CLUB BAR - NIGHT ®

Jackie enters carrying his sports bag to find his female *

agent/manager MILLER waiting for hi. *
MILLER

Are you cold? You need something
to warm you up?

JACKIE
You could torch the club so I
don’t have to do this shit.

MILLER
Be prepared - it’s not as big a
house as they thought. I think the
weather kept people home.

JACKIE
You sure it’s not the marquee?
Reads like Night of the Living

Dead.
INT. KITCHEN AREA - GOVERNOR’S CLUB - CONTINUOUS 8
Miller leads Jackie through a busy kitchen. Jackie *
strips off his peacoat as they pass the kitchen help. *

JACKIE
I should fire you for this.

MILLER *
You said anything. You need money.

*

Jackie sets down his sports bag on a kitchen table, and *
Jackie starts shedding his winter garb: He takes off his *
hat and gives it to Miller. He unzips his sports bag and *
pulls out a pair of tennis shoes - kicking off his rubber *
snow boots, he slides on the loafers. *
MILLER *
Oh, CBS passed on the pilot. *
JACKIE
They give a reason?
MILLER *
They didn’t like it. *
JACKIE *
You tell me this before I go on? *
What you do before you fuck your *
boyfriend? Watch a Holocaust *
movie? *
MILLER *
At least I have a boyfriend. What *
relationship do you have? *
We can see the half-filled showroom through the kitchen *
door. We hear laughter from the showroom. *
JACKIE *
(points at audience) *
I’ve got them. . . the audience.
MILLER
You want to say hi to JJ?
JACKIE
No.
He walks out of the kitchen toward the showroom. Miller *
follows. *

JIMMIE WALKER

JACKIE

JIMMIE WALKER
Good to see you, man. Thanks for
coming.

JACKIE
Thanks for having me.

JIMMIE WALKER
It’s a small house but they’ re

JACKIE
I only need one person to play.
Sometimes I just play with myself.

JIMMIE WALKER
Dy-no-mite!

Jimmie nods, and moves toward the stage as Brett Butler
finishes her act.

Finally, Jackie takes a small mirror out of the sports
bag and hands it to Miller, who now holds all of Jackie’s
discarded cloths. She holds up the mirror so Jackie can
arrange his hair.

JIMMIE WALKER (V.O.)
She’s still “UNDER FIRE”, let’s
hear it once again for Brett
Butler! DY-NO-MITE!!!

JACKIE

MILLER

ONE OF THE GIRLS
Bachelorette party!

JACKIE
Bachelorette party!

JACKIE IN GIRL’S VOICE
Heather, I told you we should have
gone to Chippendales! I don’t
care if they’re all gay.

 

JACKIE
Okay, how many first dates in the
house?

Crowd reaction.

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Quite a few.
(looks at a Table)
J-Date?
(table nods)
I thought so.
(then to WAITRESS)
Table 14 - separate checks.
(audience laughs)
How ‘bout married couples?
(several shouts)
Oh, quite a few

Jackie turns around so he’s facing the Back Wall. He
talks into the mic sotto voce - an internal dialogue.

JACKIE TO HIMSELF
Maybe I shouldn’t do any marriage
jokes. Everyone’s is a good mood.
They just saw Brett Fucking
Butler, they’re happy. I can’t
crush their world with bleak shit
about marriage. Keep it light,
right?

Jackie turns around and faces the audience.

JACKIE
(growling into Mic)

Marriage will suck every speck of
life from your soul until there’s
nothing left but one giant
festering sore! No, really. I’ma
big fan of marriage, Hicksville.
I must be; I’ve been married four
times.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I don’t think it’s just me. I

meant to be together. Want a
relationship? Get a canary. Get
a fish. Don’t get a cat -- that’s
too sad. But get a hamster. Get

you. A dog don’t judge. Like when
You’ re late?

JACKIE AS DOG
Hey, Jackie, no big deal. WOOF.

JACKIE
You forget to feed them.

JACKIE AS DOG
It’s okay, Jackie, I’1l manage.
WOOF.

JACKIE
You can even come home smelling
like pussy, and they’1ll love you
even more.

JACKIE AS DOG
(sniff, sniff)
Jackie, my man! WOOF WOOF..

 

(sniff)
...Dawg, you smell great! You
been into some cool shit. WOOF.

WOOF.

JACKIE
You can even bring another dog
home. Sure, your steady dog might
get a little jealous, but the
worst he’s gonna do is pee on your
carpet, shit on the floor, maybe
chew up a shoe or two. My third
wife did all those things. But
then she went and did what all
wives do -- she got a lawyer.
A dog will never do that. A dog
will never go out and get a
lawyer. And here’s another thing
a dog will never do. When a dog
dies, it will not be resurrected
25 years later on “Nostalgia
Night.” Now I’m not suggesting
anything, but if you get the right
kind of dog--

Jackie is interrupted by a HECKLER seated in front with
his BLONDE GIRLFRIEND.

HECKLER
(shouting)
Enough of this dog shit! Come on,
do Eddie!

JACKIE
Not now pal, I’m working out some
new stuff here.

HECKLER
Yeah, no, I didn’t pay to hear new
material. I paid to see “Eddie”.

As before, Jackie turns his back to the audience, and
speaks into the mic sotto voce - Internal dialogue:

JACKIE TO HIMSELF

Oh Christ, a heckler. This must
be the infamous Hicksville Heckler
I’ve been warned about. Big, loud,
stupid ...I could destroy him,
but I might lose the audience.
They’re on my side now.
I’m ona roll. 1/11 kill him with
kindness, go on with the bit, see
where it leads.

(turns back to

Audience & Heckler)
My friend, this is a place of
peace where brothers and sisters
gather together to nourish their
souls with comedy and
refreshments. You’ve come into
this, and--

Now YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS

JACKIE (CONT’D)
DESTROYED IT ALL YOU SNIVELING,
FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT CUNT, YOU
SCUM SUCKING HIDEOUS FOUL
DETESTABLE POOR EXCUSE FOR A LIFE
FORM. YOU UNEVOLVED, LOATHSOME,
VULGAR REPUGNANT ZIT ON THE ASS OF
MANKIND.

Jackie abruptly turns around again to his “Internal
Dialogue” position.

(CONTINUED)

JACKIE TO HIMSELF
I think it’s working; I’m getting
through to him. That’s what we
comedians do, fix it all witha
joke . . . with our wit.

HECKLER
(yells from Audience)
Hey. I’m the audience. You’re here
to entertain me! You work for me.

JACKIE
(to the audience)
You hear that, I work for him.

He turns back to the Heckler.

JACKIE

YOU SCROFULOUS, PUSTULAR, DISEASED
DICK OF A CUM CHUGGING, MOTHER
FUCKING, SCAT MUNCHING, ASS
LICKING PILE OF RANCID SHIT.

Please enjoy the rest of the show.

Jackie hears the Heckler speak triumphantly to his
girlfriend.

HECKLER
You getting this all, Amy?

Jackie peers past the lights and sees a woman adjusting a
GoPro Camera on a professional GoPro Steadi-Stick.

AMY
I don’t want all that in our show.

JACKIE

HECKLER
This is my show! I did Carrot Top

Jackie gets off the stage and walks to Heckler’s table.

JACKIE
You went down on Carrot Top?

Heckler grabs Jackie’s mic and faces Go-Pro.

HECKLER
Blow job jokes? A sign of
weakness.

Jackie tries to pull his mic out of Heckler’s hands.

JACKIE
Don’t touch the mic.

HECKLER
(into the camera)
This is Archie Severin challenging
Jackie Burke to a comic-face-off.

JACKIE
(pulling at mic)
Let go of my mic.

HECKLER

yours. I challenge you to a comic-

HECKLER

JACKIE

Jackie uses the Heckler’s own force to bang the mic
against the Heckler’s head and face...

HECKLER
OW. ..STOP

JACKIE
HERE! YOU WANT THE MIC ... YOU
WANT THE FUCKING MIC...EAT IT!!!

JACKIE POUNDS THE HECKLER WITH THE MIC -

Blood spurts from the Heckler’s nose, Jackie rips the mic
out of the Hecklers hands and pushes him over the table
onto his girlfriend, who screams.

Jackie grabs the Go Pro and speaks into it in the cadence
of his stand-up:

JACKIE

And if you do get a dog, don’t
take it to a comedy club.

(turns to audience)
I see my time is up. Thank you
everyone. Don’t forget to tip
your waitresses, and be careful
not to step in the puddles of
blood on your way out. GOOD NIGHT!

 

The audience is in shock, but a few shout their approval.
Jackie crosses to Miller and rushes out with her.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP: DIGITAL IMAGE ON AN I-PAD 9

We see the shaky image of Jackie from the Go-Pro’s POV,

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Jackie’s Attorney stands before the JUDGE, Judith
Mansfield, showing her the video on the I-Pad. The
Prosecutor stands beside him also watching.

JACKIE’S ATTORNEY
Your Honor, as you can clearly
see, Mr. Severin grabbed Mr.
Burkowitz first. Mr. Burkowitz
warned Mr. Severin several times
to desist, and he refused.

Jackie sits at the defense table. Miller sits behind him.
The “victim” (Severin) with a bandage over his nose and
bruised eye, sits behind the Prosecutor’s table.

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Any objection to probation?

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
With a strong Public Apology and
substantial Community Service.

Nods to her Clerk. Attorneys return to their clients.
Jackie’s attorney gives him a “we won” thumbs up.

COURT CLERK
Will the defendant please rise.

Jackie stands.

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Jonathan Burkowitz, the court
understands there are mitigating
circumstances, but nothing excuses
your retaliation. It is in the
judgement of the court that you
will serve 100 hours of community
service, attend 10 anger
management sessions and make an
allocution and apology. Do you
understand, Mr. Burkowitz?

JACKIE
Yes, Your Honor.

JUDGE MANSFIELD
And in accordance with the
agreement, are you prepared to
change your plea from ‘not guilty
to ‘guilty.’

Severin in fact has a brain.

Miller covers her face.

the look like Donald Trump fucked
Alfred E Newman after a night of
snorting thalidomide.

More laughter. The Judge pounds her gavel for order.

SEVERIN

Can he say that to me?

JACKIE
Look at him right now, struggling
to understand what I’m saying.

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Stop right now. I’m warning you--

JACKIE
This is more than just about me,
Judge. I think humanity’s fate is
in your hands. Remember, he was
with a female that night. What if
they breed?

JACKIE (V.O.)
Growing up, my family observed all
the Thanksgiving traditions. My
favorite was my Uncle Moshit
telling the Thanksgiving Story.

INT. THE BOWERY MISSION - CONTINUOUS - DAY 22

The cramped space is filled with hungry vets, hookers,
trannies, etc...some still shivering from the cold.

Jackie, wearing a black hair net underneath a sanitary
hat, is dishing out food. While dishing out food, he
speaks into a microphone on a stand;

JACKIE
Uncle Moshit told me that before
the first Thanksgiving, Pilgrims
thought turkeys were sex objects.
They couldn’t fly and “gobble
gobble” was Puritan for “blowjob”.
When the Indians showed up - right
after the Macy’s Parade - they
brought turkeys all trussed up.
The Pilgrims were pissed. They
were like “They’re eating our fuck
birds”. But being Puritans, they
didn’t want to be rude. And it
turned out, turkeys tasted better
than going down on their wives.

Beyond the line of homeless, Jackie can’t help notice -

HARMONY, refilling ice tea and cups of coffee - laughs at
Jackie’s routine along with the crowd.

JACKIE
So the Puritans stopped fucking
the turkeys and started fucking
the Indians instead. And that’s
how we stole their country and
made the turkey our national bird.

Scattered applause and laughs. Jackie’s eye follows
Harmony across the room, filling the coffee cups of two
vets as she talks to them. She’s full of energy. Everyone
seems to like her. Including Jackie.

Jackie walks up a flight of stairs to the chapel office

Suddenly, Uncle Seymour goes over and pulls Harmony onto
the dance floor.

Jackie and James and Flo watch with respective interest

Although Harmony’s steps have nothing to do with the
Uncle’s steps, the crowd gets bigger and the claps get
louder. The Uncle is spurred on by the excitement of
Harmony dancing with him, starts to go faster and faster,

Because she was married to him. I

Oh God, I’m so sorry.

I wasn’t any kind of father. And

I’m a comedian. I did jokes about

Jackie is disappointed. He sees her note:
“Dear Jackie.

May slumps over. Her head hits the table hard, right in
front of her mic. Everyone gasps, leaping to their feet.

Richard Belzer and others hurry to help her. No one is
paying attention to Jackie. The dais guests gather around
May. Jackie is dazed, still in his comic high mode:

JACKIE
Hello everybody. I’m Uncle Jackie
Burke and welcome to “SAY UNCLE”,
the new reality show where we
actually torture people until they
say, “Uncle”. Our first contestant
is Mark Chapel from Brookline,
Massachusetts. How you doing
today, Mark?

MARK
Great.

Reveal MARK - a middle aged dad wearing only goggles and
a bathing suit. TWO SEXY, SCANTILY-CLAD MODELS are
painting his body with molasses.

His wife and kids watch from the front row.

Miller stands with Carol and two of her RIOT TV execs
behind the monitor.

JACKIE
Right now our two anthropology
majors from Camel Toe U are
basting you with molasses. When
they’ re done, all you have to do
is lay down in this geese pen and
we’ll release these hungry birds.

Reveal a GEESE PEN full of squawking geese. Mark lays
down. A small picket fence separates him from the birds.

JACKIE
Don’t forget Mark. If you last two
minutes with the geese, you’1l1 win
this new hybrid car and a
Carribbean vacation for you and
your entire family.

Mark’s family jumps up and down. Jackie takes notice. One
kid - around three - has no idea what’s happening.

JACKIE
You’ re sure you’re ready?

MARK
Yes, Uncle Jackie.

JACKIE
Are you wearing a protective cup?

MARK
No.

JACKIE
Okay then Mark, you better hold on
tight to those butter balls as I
release the angry birds.

Jackie pulls a lever and a wall in the pen lifts up. The
audience cheers as the geese begin pecking at Mark’s
skin. At first it tickles. The audience is laughing.

JACKIE
Hang in there Mark! You’re halfway
home.

Mark begins rolling around frantically as the birds
become more aggressive. The contestant is clearly
bleeding from numerous cuts. He squeals in pain.

In the front row, his children are scared. Jackie sees
Mark’s three old starts to cry. Jackie see

MARK
Ahhh! Ahhh!

JACKIE
You can do it, Mark. This time
next week, you’ll be in the
Bahamas with your beautiful
family.

His family winces, upset and scared. Jackie fights off
the disgust he feels. He looks over to Miller. Everyone
around her is cheering, but she knows Jackie so well.

MARK
AHHH!AHHH! UNCLE! UNCLE!

The cheering suddenly stops as Mark leaps out of the pen.
He is covered in hay, brown sugar and splotches of blood.
His family is horrified. Jackie puts his arms around

Mark, along with a towel and robe, and looks into camera.

JACKIE

“Say Uncle” will be right back.
But as for me, I’d rather have
Stevie Wonder shave my testicles
with a butcher knife than be part
of a this reality shit. So this is
Jackie Burke saying “Uncle”, and
Riot TV can go fuck itself!!!!

Jackie steps off the set. The crew and audience stare in
disbelief. As he crosses Carol, Jackie says:

JACKIE
And I’m keeping the suit.

Miller looks to Carol, then exits after Jackie.

Jackie senses a change. They’re all smiling.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I wanted to call and find out how
you were but it felt strange to
just call after the way we left
things...and I wanted to give you
something anyway so I flew in. You
look great.

HARMONY
Thanks. What’s that?

Jackie takes out some photos from the box.

JACKIE
I leave this to your decision. But
I thought - whether I’m in the
kid’s life or not,

Jackie hands her the box ... an old wooden wine box.

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Just photos of me and my family
he or she may want to know
some things about me.

HARMONY
Wow ... Thanks.

Beat.

JACKIE
I just want to say, I’d like to be
a part of the kid’s life in any
way you're comfortable with. You
make the rules. Whatever you
decide. Think about it. Don’t say
anything now, OK?

HARMONY
OK.

Jackie and Harmony have a silent beat.

JACKIE
Take care of yourself.

HARMONY
You too.

Without another word Jackie walks away. Harmony watches
him leave. Then she looks down into the box:

We see a whole treasure trove of photos of Jackie’s
family life ... not his career ... his family. Jackie as
a young boy, Jimmy and Britany when she was a little
girl, etc. The only momento of his career is one of his
albums: “Inside Jackie Burke”.

Harmony looks after Jackie who has disappeared.

CUT TO:
EIGHT-TEN YEARS LATER.

EXT. FLORIDA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITIORIUM - DAY

A parking lot of cars. A CAB OR TOWN CAR drives up to the
entrance and stops (carrying Jackie from the airport - we
may or may not see him exit)

INT. FLORIDA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITIORIUM - DAY

A BANNER READS: TALENT SHOW. The audiences is filled with
parents with video cameras or phones, recording their
kids. A LITTLE GIRL is on stage singing, off key.

Harmony is sitting with the new man in her life. We’1ll
call him GARY - age appropriate. Working class style.
Nice, down to earth guy. They holds hands. AN EMPTY SEAT
waits beside Harmony.

From the back of the auditorium, Jackie enters with a
carry-on bag. He spots Harmony and sits in the empty
seat. They whisper as the kid on stage sings:

(NOTE: THE GENDER OF JACKIE AND HARMONY’S KID WILL BE
SUBJECT TO CASTING. FOR THE SCRIPT, IT WILL READ HE/SHE
or HER/HIM).

HARMONY
Oh good you made it.
JACKIE
My flight got delayed. Hi Gary.
GARY
Hey Jackie.

The kid on stage finishes on a sour note but everyone
applauds and cheers. Over the Loud Speaker, we hear:

OUR NEXT TALENTED YOUNGSTER IS...
(NAME PENDING CASTING) .

Jackie, Harmony and Gary applaud with the audience.

Jackie and Harmony’s 8 year old crosses to center stage,
stands before a microphone to do a stand-up routine.

JACKIE/HARMONY’S KID
So what’s the deal with chores and
allowances? I turn eight and my
mom says “I’1ll give you ten
dollars a week to make your room,
wash the dishes and clean the
cat’s litter box”. Ten dollars?
That’s slave labor. I go to our
neighbor’s house and I say,
“What’11 you give me if I make
your room, wash your dishes and
clean your cat’s litter box?”
Neighbor says I don’t have a cat.
So I piss in her hallway and say,
“You go to 15 a week and I’1l
supply the pussy”.

Various shots of stunned parents, appalled and shocked.
ON JACKIE and HARMONY - laughs, beaming with pride.

BACK ON THE KID. Not getting a response, he/she taps the
microphone.

JACKIE/HARMONY’S KID
This fucking thing on?

Jackie and Harmony smile proudly.
