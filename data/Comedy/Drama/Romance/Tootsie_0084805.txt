Only one area in focus, It is an actors! character box.
We SLOWLY PAN to see: a monocle, different pairs of

eyeglasses, rubber ap lianceés, Various makeups, a
collection of dental applications, an aSsorctient of
brushes, A hand comes into frame and removes @ small
Bottle. WE FOLLOW to see it is spirit + The other
hand enters frame and uncaps the botclé, FOLLOW one
hand as it applies the spirit gum to a cheek. We see
only a portion of the cheek. Now the hands apply spirit
gun to @ Her scar. Again we FOLLOW the hands as they
Place the scar upon the actor's cheek. The ritual
continues as we watch a moustache being applied. The
hands then search out the dental appliances and pick
one. We study the movement as the appliance is inserted
into the actor's mouth, Throughout the above we HEAR
Someone mumbling, but we cannot make out the words,
Suddenly we HEAR:

light, and begins to look through Sandy's clothes. As he
looks at the dress hanging on the inside of the closet door,
he notices the dress laid out on the bed.

MICHAEL
Oooh!

Michael picks up the dress, looks in the mirror as he holds
the dress in front of himself. He glances again at the
bathroom door, puts the dress down on the bed, and begins
to undress. He throws his sweatshirt onto the bed, undoes
his pants, and bends down while lowering them. Suddenly,
Sandy starts out of the bathroom.
