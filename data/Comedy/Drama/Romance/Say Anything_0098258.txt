LLOYD DOBLER, 19, sits slumped in a small chair, He's tall,

bulky, his nose looks slightly mashed. Hidden in there’
somewhere is a good-looking kid. Lloyd thumbs through a

newspaper, sips a Super Big Gulp from 7-11.

We're in the bedroom of COREY FLOOD, 17. It's a
weigh-station between school and home. Corey's walls
feature photos and collages, most of them featuring a

darkly-handsome young man named Joe... Corey sits on her bed,
playing .Led Zeppelin riffs on an amplified electric guitar.

By ‘her bed is a four-track cassette recorder -- the sign

of a musician. Sitting on the floor, writing in a journal,

is girlfriend D.c. She's a loyal supporter of her two

friends, an introvert who mediates between two extroverts.

Corey looks down at the school annual open on her. bed.

COREY
I don't,feel anything.

D.C.
Come on. It's graduation.

COREY
It's all so phony. Did you see what
Mr. Carroll wrote in my yearbook?
He ridiculed me all year long in
English, then he wrote -~ ‘You're
a real live wire...Love, Mr.

Carroll.' “

D.c.
He wants to leave things on a good
note.

COREY

When Mr. Carroll says ‘love' I start
looking for a new word.

D.c. :
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Lloyd looks up from his newspaper.
: LLOYD
If life was a movie, what would it
be rated?

That's too bad.
LLOYD

I'm doing something about it. I'm
going to take Diane Court out again.

The girls exchange meaningful looks.

COREY
Unlikely.

LLOYD
The movies is a good second ‘date’,
right?

COREY

You never had a first date.

: D.c.
I hate that word 'date.'

/ LLOYD ; -
I sat across from her at Bell
Square. We both ate. That's
sharing eating -- an important
physical event. Why. isn't that
going out?

COREY .
That's not even a scam.

Going out as friends.

No it's not. Scam is lusting.

LLOYD
Then what is a date?

The girls take a moment to consider.
D.c.

A date is...prearrangement with a
- possibility for love.

LLOYD
I'm going to call her.
COREY
Lloyd.
LLOYD
What?
COREY
Diane Court doesn't go’ ‘cut’. She's
a brain...
D.C.

...trapped in the body of a game
show hostess.

COREY
Diane Court doesn't even know how
good-looking she is. All she thinks
about it bio-chemistry.

LLOYD
This all sounds great to me. I'm
going to call her.

COREY :
Lloyd. Brains stay with brains.
The bomb could go off, and their
mutant genes would form the same
cliques.
He gets up, bounces lightly off the walls.
D.c.
I wouldn't get my hopes up, Lloyd.

Did she ever say anything about me,
Corey? Tell me the truth.

_ INT. COURT LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 5

JAMES COURT, 48, is a friendly and charismatic father.

- There is an infectious good humor about him, even in the

way he takes a light nap while San Cooke's "You Send Me"

‘plays on his prized jukebox. Court sings along, harmonizes

with the record -- he's not bad... The PHONE RINGS, Court
leans across the coffee table to pick it up. The phone is
one of those too-new, too-sophisticated models. Court must
unfold it to answer it. He has a tough time with it, as
he deals with the call.

COURT
Jim Court. No, Diane isn't home.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?

expensive-looking black pen from his pocket. He scribbles
on the back of the magazine.

LLOYD
She's really great, isn't she?

COURT
Yes she is. Good luck, kid.
Court puts the phone down. A moment later, it RINGS AGAIN.

COURT
(expecting Lloyd)
Jim Court.

We SEE that this is a new and very different caller. As
he listens, his face travels the gamut of human emotion.

* COURT
Yes, this is her father.
I...really? No, I didn't get the
letter...

«..No...okay, right now. Yes!
Good-bye! Thank you. Yes!

INT. CAR - AFTERNOON 7

Court drives his Volvo through town. He's a rising tide
of emotion, tries: listening to the radio. Can't. He pulls
over, almost cries...does a little...feels pure joy. He
continues on. : ¥ . .

EXT. GOLDEN SEASONS NURSING. HOME - AFTERNOON 8

Court pulls into'the owner's spot in front of the Golden
Seasons Nursing Home. On the porch outside, three elderly
residents come to life as they see him arrive. He has a
caring smile for them, as the home's Administrator ("RUTH")
greets hin. :

of colored pencils rest on her lap. She's been drawing a
mountain range.

COURT
Eleanor darling, that's beautiful.

Eleanor beams, Court moves inside the home.
INT. NURSING HOME 9

It's a well-scrubbed, smallish (54 beds) home. Court moves
quickly, ‘dealing with the residents along the way. He
passes ROBERT ("THE WALKER") TAYLOR. He's 90, with bushy
eyebrows, hefty hearing aid and a cane. He carries an
envelope. :

COURT
Mr. Taylor, you're a vision in
green. Let me mail that for you.

WALKER
Thank you.

‘ COURT
You can trust a man who writes a
letter everyday.

Court keeps moving, Ruth peels away. He passes Sabina, 94.
Her jacket is open.

SABINA
Please please please.

COURT
You need a safety pin for your
jacket, right? You were cold...

Court ‘reaches into a nearby desk for a pin, expertly pins
her jacket. .

SABINA ‘

herself. He routinely pulls it down, hurries around the
corner.

I need to talk to you, honey.
ARTIST :

ur. court, I'm sketching the perfect
girl. I need another minute.

COURT
You've got another minute.

DIANE
What is it?

Diane sees Ter father's impatience. An elder resident
wheels up to Court in the doorway. She is EVA, 86. She
has a throaty voice, dry from cigarettes and medication.

_ EVA
Why didn't you ask me to be in this?

COURT
Because everyone would know you're
my favorite, and they'd get jealous.

.Is that thing done yet?

You're a good man. You helped me
with my finances. when my own brother
wouldn't. Sssssst. . .

looks on with strange wonder. (They're both wearing the
same large earrings.) Diane catches the look.

DIANE
Are you okay, Dad? What are you
looking at?

Something has changed and. she knows it.

that her Confused Boyfriend is following. She gets in her
Corolla -- with LHS 88 frosted on a side-rear window -- and
cries against the steering wheel. Her Confused Boyfriend
follows her, but he walks in zig-zags in the street, torn
between her and friends yelling for him back at the party.

These days ypu have corporations
who own hundreds of nursing homes,
and thousands of beds. They buy
wheelchairs in bulk, and they care
for their residents in bulk
too...and that means the poorer
patients suffer. .

COUNCILMAN
For example.

COURT
As long as you're a private pay
resident, you get a good room. But
if you run out of money, and switch
to a government program ~~ Medicaid
-“- you may find yourself taken to
the hospital for a 'check-up,' and
when you get back...your bed is
filled. So you get switched to a
smaller room, or maybe a different
home, and maybe your buzzer doesn't
get. answered quite as quickly. It's
a nightmare, it's a scam, and you'd
be surprised at the government
agencies who've checked me out once
I started talking about this stuff.

Diane admires her father, who is getting through to this
bored group. :

COURT
My home is a family business. I
feel we can add a new wing and still
provide the personal service which
I. feel makes us the best. This is
not a nursing home where the owner
wears a suit and lives a thousand

miles away..--

INT. SHOT - LLOYD AND DIANE - NIGHT 89

VERY CLOSE ANGLE as they kiss. Their faces are close
together, side-by-side. We SEE a part of a blanket. A
radio plays at low volume. Lloyd wipes a thin stream of
sweat from her cheek. They've just finished making love.

She squeezes him. Lloyd's face is that of someone who knows
he's having a peak experience. He is confident, resolute,

happy.

DIANE
I never thought I'd sleep with you.

We WATCH Lloyd’s face as the confidence peels at the edges.

LLOYD
Really?

DIANE.
I just couldn't picture it. I
didn't think it would work. Boy
was I wrong.

The confidence returns. Then, out of nowhere, he grits his
teeth. He begins shaking.

can almost see Lloyd trying to save it forever, as his teeth
begin to chatter.

I'm going to hang onto the best
thing that ever happened to me.
We want to be together.

COURT
Did she say ‘yes' to this?

LLOYD
That's the word she used, Sir.

couRT
Lloyd, I'm going to tell you
something...and you're going to feel
that little pang in your heart that
says it's true. -Okay? This isn't
what's good for her.

(pause)

And what are you going to do when
she's working? What are you going
to do when she's studying?

LLOYD
sir, you're talking to the man who
is going to bring kickboxing to
Europe.

4 COURT
It's a mistake.

LLOYD
That's what they said to Brad
Hefton.

COURT
Who's that?

LLOYD
I realize you're busy, Sir. Brad
Hefton brought kickboxing to
America. .

COURT
You're not a permanent part of her
life, Lloyd. You're a distraction.

LLOYD
Well, I'm the distraction that's
going with her to England.

Court caves in, head in hand. He registers the pain.

Are you all right, Mr. Court? I

COURT
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd.

Lloyd looks at the guy, truly feels for him. Lloyd pulls
something out of his pocket.

LLOYD
I have a note for you from Diane.

ANGLE ON COURT who looks up.

LLOYD
She left it up to me...whether or
not you were ready far it.

ANGLE ON COURT who looks at Lloyd. Give it to me.

ANGLE ON LLOYD who slowly hands him the letter. Court grabs
it, taps it endwise -- he doesn't want to tear it. He opens
it’ and withdraws a thick, handwritten missive on thin white
airmail stationery. Court leafs through the pages -~ all
ten of then.

ANGLE ON THE LETTER 139

and it has the look of a single, cathartic burst. The pages

script. . = :

Court begins the letter.

LLOYD
‘I wasn't sure which version she
sent.

Lloyd gets up, moves to Court and makes an attempt to look
at the letter. Court pulls the letter closer to himself.

She can't still be this angry. It's

LLOYD

It does if it's the version she
signed 'I can't help loving you...'

Court looks up for a moment, hopeful, then rifles to the
last page. A.long moment while he reads the end. He looks
up slowly.

COURT
(quietly)
Just her name.

Even Lloyd feels the chill. Court continues to stare at
the last page.

LLOYD
Well. Sir. Just knowing she wrote
it, just knowing a version with 'I
can't help loving you'
exists...knowing that she felt that
even for a minute...that's got to
be a good sign. Right? That's got
to be good.

Court looks up.

COURT
No, Lloyd.

LLOYD
No.

No. I don't deserve to lose my
daughter over this. No, I don't

No. Enough of this. No more of

He gets up, guides Lloyd to the door. As he does, the door
opens. A guard leads Diane in. The two men are surprised
out of their clash.

DIANE
Hello.

COURT
Hi.

Lloyd says nothing, fades in the b.g. Diane sees the letter
in her father's hand.

. DIANE
I don't know what to say to you
except good-bye.

She looks at Court, who stands silent. He makes a step
toward her. She shakes her head -- no.

DIANE
Take care of yourself.

COURT
You too.

She leaves. Lloyd lingers a moment. He turns to follow
Diane. :

COURT
Lloyd. Wait...
Lloyd turns.
COURT : ‘
Can you get me an address, where

she'll be?

Lloyd pulls out a piece of paper, and writes out the address
from a card in his wallet.

COURT :
I never meant to hurt her.

Lloyd hands Court the address. Court nods thanks.

INT. APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING . 141

Diane watches as Lloyd releases Constance from a hug. She
stuffs money in his pocket. Lloyd finds Jason, who is
hiding behind the door in Samura uniform. Silently, Lloyd
bows. Jason bows back. :

Lloyd turns the music past the red line. The neighbors
start pounding. ‘Constance lets the music play. Lloyd sits
on his suitcase, struggles to close it.

INT. AIRPLANE - AFTERNOON 142

A Stewardess moves down the aisle, closing overhead bins,

as the plane lurches out onto the runway. We FIND Lloyd

and Diane sitting toward the back of the plane. They occupy
the middle two seats of a five-passenger row. Both look
excited, nervous. Next to Lloyd is an older Gent with a
cane. Next to Diane is a middle-aged Woman who is asleep.

A loud noise starts, like a huge dentist's drill. .

LLOYD
(confidently)
Wing adjustments.

The plane picks up speed, pushing Lloyd and Diane back into
their seats.

LLOYD
Blink twice if you're fine.
DIANE
I'm fine. :
LLOYD
Geed. This is all very normal.
Lloyd turns, smiles at the Woman next to Diane, who returns

only the slightest quiver of her lip. He turns to the GENT
next to him.

LLOYD
How are you today?

GENT
(English accent)
Very well and you.

LLOYD
Fine. That's a nice cane, Sir.
It's a pleasure to be flying with
you.’ 7

 

GENT
Indeed.

Lloyd turns back to Diane.

LLOYD
Now about your dad...

DIANE :
I'mnot ready to talk about this
yet, Lloyd.

LLOYD
Cool. Then later.
(on her look).
Way later.

ANGLE ON THE CEILING COMPARTMENTS which all seem to rattle
independently, as if nothing on this airplane is connected.

LLOYD
That is standard for the 747.

The plane banks sharply, hits an airpocket. Its a turbulent
take-off. Somewhere nearby, a very loud baby begins to cry.
Lloyd immediately leans in close to Diane, as if he's
briefing the President.

Okay. High-level airline safety

happen, it almost always happens
in the first five minutes of the
flight. Got that? So when you hear
that sacking sign ding, that means
everything is okay. :

DIANE
Good...to...know.

Another bump. Another baby cries.

LLOYD -
I'll just continue talking until
that ding occurs. Which will be
soon. :

He opens the box on his lap. Lloyd withdraws an elaborate
supply of flight-items from a bag, including a felt pen
Corey collags/letter written on aluminum foil.

LLOYD
: In the meantime, here is our
Personal Flight Kit from Corey.
Music...headsets...letters...
