"ROUTE 9"
Screenplay by Brendan Broderick and Rob Kerchner

	

FADE IN 

EXT DESOLATE ROAD - DAY

The sound of HEAT BUGS rises -- fat blades of GRASS grow through the cracked asphalt of a DESOLATE THROUGHWAY -- 

In the background weeds grow chest-high, neglected for 
years -- 

A RUSTED HIGHWAY SIGN indicates the stretch was once a vital artery, years ago -- it SQUEAKS as it wobbles, alone 
in the faint wind -- the heat is intense --

Far in the horizon a trail of DUST rises down the road,  and soon we see a beat-up MERCEDES BENZ approach -- 

The car passes, and drives down the road -- 

INT MERCEDES - DAY

CLIFF, a gaunt-looking Hispanic man with bad skin, drives the car -- 

NATE, another Hispanic, sits next to him.  In the back seat is DENNING, a white man with greasy hair slicked back --  

Cliff takes of his sunglasses, looks at them and puts them back on -- the glare is heavy -- 

POV the car passes another sign -- under it is a smaller, rectangular SIGN reading "ROUTE 9."

				NATE
		Maybe this isn't the right road.  
		There's nothing out here -- 

Cliff looks at him -

				CLIFF
		You're like a broken record.
		Shut up and relax!

			DENNING
		We're on Route 9.  This is it.
			(wincing)
		I gotta take a leak sooo bad...

				CLIFF
		Hold it.

Denning looks down the road -- 

Cliff looks ahead -- 
EXT DESOLATE ROAD - DAY

The Mercedes turns on to another road -- 

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

The station has been shut for years and picked clean of most everything -- in the distance we see the Mercedes approach -

INT MERCEDES - DAY

The men look at the station.  No cars.  No nothing.

				NATE
		Where are they?

				CLIFF
		They'll be here.

Cliff puts a stick of GUM in his mouth and chews it, masking his anxiety -- 

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

The Mercedes pulls up, and Cliff and Denning get out -- 

				CLIFF
		Damn it's hot...

Denning heads over into some weeds to pee, walking in pain - 

				DENNING
			(mostly to himself)
		Any longer, I'da pissed my pants.

Cliff stretches, talking to Nate through the open door.

				CLIFF
		All right when they get here, 
		we're gonna play it cool, do 
		it quick and get the hell out 
		of here before some six-toes 
		show up with their hats all 
		bent back.

				NATE
		Close the door, you're letting 
		out the AC -- 

But Cliff ignores the request, staring down the road at something approaching.

				CLIFF
		Here they come.
A white VAN rises over a small hill, appearing for a second, and then disappearing again.  

It appears over the nearest rise, pulling into the station.

The van stops.

The doors do not open.  The sunlight glints off its windows, preventing anyone from seeing inside.

Cliff scrutinizes the van, pulling back the chamber of his .45 AUTOMATIC and sticking it in the back of his pants.

The van is silent for another long beat, but then the side door opens, and THREE MEN get out -- WILLIE, AIELLO, 
AND DIXON.  Mean-looking and untrustworthy,  they close the van door and look around before focusing on Cliff -

Cliff looks at them -- 

Inside the car, Nate has his hands on his concealed UZI -- 

Cliff masks his anxiety, looking at the men -- 

Willie approaches -- 

				WILLIE
		Let's see what you got.

Cliff stares at him for a beat -- then goes to the trunk of the car and opens it -- 

Willie follows and looks at Nate, who coldly returns the stare before looking ahead -- 

Aiello and Dixon stand and face the Mercedes -- 

Cliff appears to open something in the trunk -- Willie inspects it -- 

				CLIFF
			(anxious)
		Now all we have to do is test 
		your product and we'll all 
		be on our way.

Willie looks in the trunk for a beat, then turns to Cliff -- 

				WILLIE
		Test the product?

				CLIFF
		Yeah.

				WILLIE
		Sounds like you don't trust me.

Willie goes for what's in the trunk -- 

				CLIFF
		Standard procedure, bro...

Cliff stands in front of Willie -- 
			
				CLIFF
		...standard procedure.

Willie gives him a steely look -- 

				WILLIE
		Are you saying my word is of 
		no value to you?

Cliff does not like what's happening -- he senses something is wrong -- 

				CLIFF
		Business is business.  Now where
		the hell is it?  I wanna get out
		of here.  That's the plan, we're
		just flunkies, you know what I'm
		saying?

				WILLIE
		You didn't answer my question.  
		Are you saying my word is of no 
		value to you?

				CLIFF
		You said that, I didn't.  

Willie stares at Cliff for a beat -- tension hangs heavy in the air -- 

				WILLIE
		You're getting off on a bad foot
		with me, son.
			(beat)
		You see, I don't like it when 
		people question my integrity.  
		Now nothing's going to happen 
		until you answer my question.  
		Is my word of no value to you?

Cliff stares at Willie -- 



				CLIFF
		Your word?  Well...let me see...
			(beat, then derisively)
		I guess it's fair to say I don't
		give a flying fuck through a 
		rolling donut about your word.  
		All right? Does that answer your 
		question?  

Willie stares at him, nodding -- 

				CLIFF
		Now I'm going to test the shit, 
		that was the plan, and if you have 
		a problem with it that's too bad.  
		Now where is it?

Willie ponders the offer -- 

				WILLIE
		I have a better plan.  You want to 
		hear it?

				CLIFF
			(surprised)
		What?

				WILLIE
		I have a better plan.

Cliff does not understand -- 

				CLIFF
		And what's that?

				WILLIE	
			(Beat)
		How about you give us what you 
		have and leave.  

				CLIFF
		What?

				WILLIE
			(turns to Aiello 
			 and Dixon)
		Am I speaking English here?
			(to Cliff, 
			 enunciating)
		How-about-you-give-us-what-you-
		have-and-leave?

In a flash, Cliff pulls out his gun, pointing it at Willie.

				WILLIE
		I take it that's a "no."

Aiello, Dixon, and Willie all pulls out GUNS.

INT MERCEDES - DAY

Nate grabs his gun, fighting to stay cool -- 

				NATE
			(to himself)
		Oh shit, oh shit...

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Aiello trains his gun on Nate, Willie and Dixon train theirs on Cliff, who aims at Willie -- 

				CLIFF
		What is this?  Don't be stupid 
		man...

				WILLIE
		First you question my integrity, 
		then you call me stupid...
			(shakes head)
		...that hurts, son.

Suddenly another gunman SLICK emerges from behind the van with a shotgun -- 

BLAM!!  Slick BLASTS a hole in Cliff's chest as he flies back collapsing in a bloody mess -- 

Aiello and Dixon aim at the Mercedes and BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM FIRE RELENTLESSLY at Nate -- 

Willie finishes off Cliff with a BLAST then fires at the Mercedes -- 

INT MERCEDES - DAY

Nate ducks down as the bullets tear into the car -- in a total panic he grabs the Uzi and FIRES through the windshield -- 

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Dixon is hit with a few bullets as Aiello dives behind the van for cover -- 

Nate DIVES out of the Mercedes and FIRES at Dixon, ripping him apart as Willie and Aiello return fire -- 

Nate scrambles out firing back until he is out of ammo -- he frantically goes to reload -- 

But Slick emerges from around the back of the gas station -- he aims at Nate who can't reload in time -- 

As Slick goes to fire BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM Denning BLASTS him away as he runs from the weeds, 
his shirttail out-

Willie pokes out from behind the van and FIRES at Denning -- 

POW! a direct hit to the THROAT sends Denning spinning to the ground, gurgling blood -- 

Aiello CHARGES at Nate as the two men literally face each other and empty their guns in an absurd, almost 
comical shower of bullets, tearing each other to bits -- 

Soon there is silence -- Willie slowly emerges, looks around and approaches Nate, firing a bullet into 
his head for good measure -

He then looks around and approaches the back of the 
Mercedes -- 

CLOSE on Denning's bloody hand grabbing his gun -- 
As Willie looks around again, opening the trunk -- 

POW POW POW POW! Denning shoots him offscreen, sending him staggering  -- 

Soon he collapses to the ground in a bloody mess -- 

His face HITS THE DIRT -- 

And it is silent again... 

ROLL CREDITS - "ROUTE 9"

As the credits roll, we see a MONTAGE of desert scenes, ending on --

EST. SHOT - EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY

It's isolated in a cul-de-sac of hills, with a dirt road approachment, and two cars in front.

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

The place is decked out in classic bachelor.  Clothes everywhere, a few beer bottles, magazines.  
Your mother would hate this place, but it's fine with --

SALLY HOGAN, an attractive WOMAN in her early 30's, who rolls on to her side of the bed, into frame.  
She is nude, and has a look of blissful exhaustion on her face.

She says nothing for a beat -- 

				MAN'S VOICE(O.S.)
		What time is it?

Sally looks at the clock on the nightstand -- 

				SALLY
			(Beat, closes her eyes)
		Four-thirty...

				MAN'S VOICE(O.S.)
			(Beat)
		I gotta get ready.

We then see a MAN sit up and swing his legs over the bed.  He is BOOTH PARKER, a trim, clean-cut man in his early 30's.

Sally hugs him from behind -- he reaches his arm around her and they kiss -- 

				SALLY
		We still have time.

Booth gets up, grabbing a random pair of underwear and white socks -- 	

				BOOTH
		I have to go to the bank before
		it closes.

				SALLY
		What for?

				BOOTH
		I gotta take some money out, 
		that's what for.

Booth begins to put on his DEPUTY uniform -- 

				SALLY
		There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.

				BOOTH
		Yeah but I need to take out four
		hundred dollars and the ATM will 
		only give me three.



				SALLY
		Four hundred. Thinking of buying 
		me something nice?

Booth puts on his BELT -- 

				BOOTH
		Well, not that I wouldn't sugar 
		bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're 
		going to take his car.

				SALLY
		He's irresponsible.

Booth puts on his olive green TIE -- 

				BOOTH
		Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.

				SALLY
		Has he?

				BOOTH
		No.  
			(Beat)
		But he would, probably.

Booth sits on the edge of the bed and ties his black leather shoes -- 

Booth gets up and brushes his hair -- 

Sally wraps the sheet around her and stands behind him -- 

Sally turns him around and straightens his tie -- 

				SALLY
		I hope you get it back...
			(Beat)
		We could have a lot of fun 
		with four hundred dollars...
		
They kiss - 

				SALLY
		Get a room in a nice hotel for a 
		few hours...		

				BOOTH
		I might have to look into that...

They continue to kiss -- 

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT SHERIFF'S STATION - EVENING

The building is a small sub-station off a two-lane highway outside the city. Two patrol cars are in front -- 

				JESSE'S VOICE(V.O.)
		I tell you, some people are too damn 
		smart for their own good. Take that
		case in Richfield. 

				DWAYNE'S VOICE(V.O.)
		The mother son thing...

INT SHERIFF'S STATION - EVENING

We see Sheriff DWAYNE HOGAN, a stout, ruddy-faced man in his late 40's talking to the local coroner 
JESSE SEGUNDO, a Hispanic man in his late 30's, with a mildly ghoulish air about him.  

Also in the room are Booth and his partner EARL WHITNEY, a thin man in his late 30ís.  They listen 
to the conversation.

				JESSE
		Soon as they got her on the table
		they knew it was murder, stroke or
		no.  I mean, what was this dumb son
		of a bitch thinking?  Trained 
		professionals wouldnít find a needle 
		mark in her arm?

Dwayne leans back and stretches, somewhat indifferent to the story - 

				DWAYNE
		Just goes to show you.

				JESSE
		I mean at least pick a more discreet
		place, the scalp, under the armpit,
		under the tongue, someplace where the 
		trained eye wonít immediately look.
		
Jesse wipes his forehead with his HANDKERCHIEF - 

				JESSE
		Damn itís hot in here...

				DWAYNE
		He probably figured she was on her
		way out anyhow, no drugs in her
		system, no foul play.


				JESSE
		Dwayne, Iím telling you a coroner has
		the skills and abilities to determine
		those things.  If you pump air into
		someoneís vein, a series of traumas
		occur that are clearly visible upon
		dissection.

Dwayne looks at Booth and Earl, who crack faint 
smiles - 

				JESSE
		Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Iíd have
		found it in a minute.

				DWAYNE
		All right youíre the super sleuth,
		what do you want, a medal?

				JESSE
		No.
			(smiles)
		But what I would like is the forty 
		dollars you owe me, and Iím a busy
		man.

				DWAYNE
		Dammit youíre persistent.  I donít
		want to listen to this anymore.  No
		more bets with you.

Dwayne takes out his CHECKBOOK - Jesse seems put off by 
this - 

				JESSE
		Aw, now thatís gonna take time to 
		clear!

				DWAYNE
			(writing)
		Take it or leave it.

Booth and Earl seem amused by this encounter - 

				BOOTH
		So what was your point, Jesse?








				JESSE
		My point?  My point is that by 
		analyzing all the various ways by 
		which we kill each other, it seems 
		to me there is no perfect crime.  
		Weíll get ya somehow, some way.  
		Except maybe if you use 
		potassium of something.


				BOOTH
		Huh?

Jesse looks at the two me with a comically steely 
expression - 

				JESSE
		Easy to purchase, hard to detect.
		Too much potassium can kill a man.


				EARL
			(laughs)
		You must get a lot of babes with 
		lines like that.

Everyone laughs but Jesse -- 

				DWAYNE
		I think you need to get away from
		all those stiffs.  Find yourself a 
		little senorita of your own.

An awkward beat, as Jesse stares at the floor.  Dwayne picks it up.
				DWAYNE
		Do you even have a girlfriend, 
		Jesse?

				JESSE
		Sort of.

Dwayne gets up, grabbing his lunch box -- 

				DWAYNE
		Sort of!

				BOOTH
		Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce
		him to your funeral parlor cousin?

Dwayne sucks on his teeth for a beat.  From his expression, it's clear he doesn't want 
Jesse's blood in the family line.

				DWAYNE
		She's not his type.
		
				JESSE
		Yeah.  That's all I need, to become 
		one of your in-laws.

Dwayne then grabs his coat off the rack, and begins to head out -- 
				DWAYNE
		Iím out of here.

Jesse stands up - 

				DWAYNE
		All right, deputies, take care, 
		don't let your meat loaf.

				EARL
		Don't worry the real men are in 
		charge now.

				DWAYNE
		Speaking of which that reminds
		me I have to bring something home
		or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and 
		I don't think I could stand that.

				JESSE
		You're always griping.  Cut her 
		some slack!

Dwayne heads out -- Booth watches him leave -- 

				DWAYNE
		You've never had it.  
			(emphatically)
		It's exactly like dog food.

Earl laughs.  Booth gives a courtesy smile.

				EARL
		Ready to roll, partner?

				BOOTH
		Sure thing, and -- 

Booth slaps an envelope into Earl's hand -- 

				BOOTH
		Don't spend it all in one place.

				EARL
		I knew you'd come through.
Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.

				JESSE
		What's that all about?

Booth turns to Jesse as he heads out behind Earl -- 

				BOOTH
		Drug deal.  Pay it no mind.

Jesse watches them leave -- 
									DISSOLVE TO

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A lone PATROL CAR drives down the highway -- 

INT PATROL CAR - NIGHT

CLOSE on the RADIO on the dash, which crackles to life -- a woman's VOICE comes on --  

				TRUDY(O.S.)
		Fourteen, you out there, copy?

Booth, who is driving, Picks up the radio -- 

				BOOTH
		This is fourteen, what's up Trudy?

				TRUDY(O.S.)
		Got a call from Hank Scammel.  He's	
		worried about Otis.  Can't seem to 
		find him anywhere.

				EARL
		He probably died of old age.

The two men laugh -- Booth keys the walkie -- 

				BOOTH
		All right Trudy we'll take a pass
		down Route 9, see if we
		can find him.

				TRUDY(O.S.)
		He'd appreciate that.

				BOOTH
		Don't be a stranger.

				TRUDY(O.S.)
		Thanks, Booth.
Booth hangs up the radio -- 

				EARL
		How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?

				BOOTH
		The horniest dog in Nevada.

Earl looks out the window -- 

				EARL
			(Beat)
		Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll
		have it in a few days, I promise.

				BOOTH
		Well I hope so.  That pretty much
		cleaned me out.

				EARL
		I would have asked my sister, but
		its better to leave family out, 
		always leads to trouble.

				BOOTH
		I hear you.

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The patrol car turns on to the desolate road and drives 
off -- 


INT PATROL CAR - NIGHT

				EARL
		Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law 
		Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally
		got on the show and won seven thousand 
		dollars!  Plus some leather furniture.  
		Do you think I saw any of that?  His 
		excuse was the government got it all.

				BOOTH
		Seven thousand...  

				EARL
		He would have won more but he blew
		it at the end.  Didn't know what 
		Cash and Carry was.

				BOOTH
		Cash and what?

				EARL
		Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World
		War two...

				BOOTH
		Never heard of it.

				EARL
		Oh, you would have done great.

				BOOTH
		I probably would have.  I guess 
		the clues damn near before
		everyone.

				EARL
		That's what everyone thinks.  But
		according to him, when it's the
		real thing, it's quite an intimidatin'
		environment in which to concentrate.

Suddenly Booth sees something up ahead, his expression changes  -- 

				BOOTH
		What the hell is this?

Soon he JAMS on his brakes -- 

POV 	WILLIE lies in the road -- 

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Booth and Earl get out and run over to the body, which has left a trail of blood --   

				EARL
		Who is it?

Booth rolls the man over, checks for a pulse -- 

The gunman's lifeless eyes stare back at him -- 

				BOOTH
		He ain't from around here -- 
			(Beat)
		He's deader than Caesar.

Earl looks around with his flashlight -- then sees something up the road -- 

				EARL
			(ominously)
		Get the car... 

Earl starts walking down the road -- 

Booth watches him, then stands up startled by what he 
sees -- 

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

The patrol car headlines illuminate the scene of the 
crime -- 

Bodies everywhere, blood, broken glass -- 

Earl shines his mag light around the scene as Booth gets out of the car -- 

				BOOTH
			(shocked)
		What the hell...

				EARL
		They're out of towners...
		Arizona plates...

Earl heads over to the back of the Mercedes.  The trunk is still open -- 

Booth goes down and checks the pulse of another dead 
gunman -- 
				BOOTH
		Jesus, they're all dead...

Earl opens the trunk carefully, and reacts with surprise 
at WHAT HE SEES.

Booth gets up, looks around, checks another one's pulse -- 

				BOOTH
		Well I'll be damned, I've never 
		seen anything like this...
		Gangbangers.  Must have been a 
		drug deal or something, whaddya 
		think?
			(beat)
		Let's call this in.


				EARL(O.S.)
		I think you better come over here
		partner...

Booth turns around and looks at Earl, then approaches him -

We see Booth approach the trunk -- as he looks inside his eyes widen -- 

POV inside the trunk there is a STEAMER TRUNK.  Inside the trunk are PACKETS of neatly 
arranged HUNDRED-DOLLAR BILLS, a little under three hundred of them -- 

				BOOTH
		Holy...shit...

Stunned, the men look at each other. Booth takes a packet and flips through it -- 

				BOOTH
		Ten thousand right here.

				EARL
			(digging through bag)
		There must be over a million
		dollars in here.

				BOOTH
		Shit, more than that.

Earl and Booth look at each other -- 

				BOOTH
		This is crazy...

The two stare at the money in startled silence for a beat -- 

				BOOTH
		I'm getting some flares...

Booth heads off, as Earl pulls out a CIGARETTE out of a pack and lights it.  

He thinks for a moment, then drops the cigarette and stomps it, calling after Booth.

				EARL
		Wait a minute!

Earl follows Booth -- 

				EARL
		What are we going to do?

				BOOTH
		What do you mean what are we
		going to do?

				EARL
		I mean -- 
Earl grabs Booth's arm -- 

				EARL
		What are we going to do?

The two men look at each other, both knowing what the other is thinking -- 

				BOOTH
		Call it in I guess.
			(beat)
		Why?

				EARL
		Why?  Are you kidding me?

Booth looks at him, then grabs some flares out of the 
trunk -
				BOOTH
			(beat)
		No.  We can't.

				EARL
		Look around you partner!  You
		said yourself you never saw
		anything like it.

				BOOTH
		We don't know whose money
		it is!  They might have robbed 
		a bank, who knows?

				EARL
		Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you
		think we would have heard if one,
		two -- 
			(looking around)
		shit I don't know how many were 
		at large!  Don't you think there
		would be a bulletin?  This is a 
		big ass drug deal!

				BOOTH
		We don't know that.

				EARL
		Come on Booth!  Look at these 
		scumbags around us.  Who's going 
		to know what happened!  Let's take 
		it and get out of here!

				BOOTH
		Well someone's gonna find them.

				EARL
		Hell, it won't be us!

Booth looks at Earl -- 

				BOOTH
		It won't work.

				EARL
		Why?

				BOOTH
		I told Trudy we were coming down 
		this way, that's why!

				EARL
		We'll figure something out.

Booth says nothing, as if he is actually considering it -- 

				EARL
		When's the next time you'll
		be face to face with a couple
		million dollars in cash, Booth?  
		Never!

Booth looks at him -- 

				EARL
		We would never have to worry about 
		money -- ever again, Jesus!

				BOOTH
		Suppose someone knows about the 
		money?  They're bound to ask 
		questions.

				EARL
		Who's going to question us?  
		Dwayne?  Jesse?

				BOOTH
		It's going to go bigger than that.  
		Could you stare someone straight 
		in the face and lie about it?

				EARL
		I'll worry about that when it 
		happens and if it happens, and it's 
		not gonna happen!

				BOOTH
		What makes you so sure?

				EARL
		Because...I know.

Earl looks at Booth, and pleads his case -- 

				EARL
		It's no accident we stumbled on
		this money.  It's an answer to a
		prayer!  
			(Beat)
		Every night and every day I've 
		prayed that God would just -- 
		help me out a little, give me a 
		little push.  Tonight my prayer 
		came true.

				BOOTH
		Oh so God's like Western Union and 
		he just dropped us a couple million 
		bucks?

				EARL
		That's right!

				BOOTH
		At the expense of six people.

				EARL
			(righteously)
		They killed themselves.  Besides,
		they were breaking the law.  What
		they were doing was wrong!
			(Beat)		
		Whatsamatter Booth, don't you
		believe in miracles?

Booth looks at him, then at the Mercedes -- 

				EARL
		Look, what do you say?  If we're
		going to do this we have to do it
		now.


				BOOTH
		All right hold on!  Lemme think...
			(beat)
		Shit, did you touch the car?

				EARL
		Maybe.  Who cares?



				BOOTH
		I do.  It's little shit like
		that sends people to jail! We 
		have to cover all the bases 
		if we're going to pull this!

				EARL
		All right we will.
		
Earl thinks about it -- crickets chirp in the background -- 

Earl goes to the trunk of the patrol car and pulls out a tank of GASOLINE -- 

				EARL
		We'll cover all our damn bases...

Booth looks at Earl, then back at the Mercedes, riddled with bullets -- 

				EARL
		We'll torch the bases, how's that?

				BOOTH
		Torch it?!

Earl approaches -- 

				EARL
		We'll leave a few packets in the 
		trunk, and stash the rest somewhere 
		else.  Car went up in the gunfight.

				BOOTH
		I don't know.
		
Booth looks at Earl -- 

				EARL
		C'mon Booth.  Let's do this while
		we can.
									DISSOLVE TO

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT - LATER

Earl throws the last packets into a plastic bag held open by Booth -- 
				EARL
		Two million eight hundred thousand -- 
		sweet mother we're millionaires.
			(Beat)
		I'll leave a couple.


				BOOTH
		I've got one condition.

				EARL
		What's that?


				BOOTH
		We're going to be patient. If we 
		start flashing money around, buying 
		fancy cars and fancy clothes, people 
		are going to ask questions.

				EARL
		Well, we won't do any of that shit!

Earl leaves a couple of packets in the trunk, taking one hundred-dollar BILL out of one 
of the remaining packets -- 

				EARL
		At least not for now.
		
Earl then takes a CAN of gasoline and begins to pour it on the ground by the fuel tank -- 

				EARL
		Stick the money in our trunk -- 

Booth wraps the bag tightly around the money and places it in the patrol car trunk -- 
he watches as Earl pours the gas under the car, then begins to splash the car hastily -- 

He then steps back -- the two men look at each other -- 

				EARL
		You got a match?

Booth looks at Earl then gives him his matches -- 

				EARL
		Here goes...get back...

Earl lights the C-note -

CLOSE shot of the bill slowly approaching the fuel -- 
WHOOMP! The fuel IGNITES as Earl and Booth run back to the patrol car -- soon the car 
is ENGULFED IN FLAMES -- 


				BOOTH
		That tank's gonna blow -- 

BOOM!!!! The gas tank of the car EXPLODES, sending debris flying everywhere -- 

Booth and Earl cover themselves, illuminated by the bright orange light -- 

The two men watch -- 

The car is a flaming metal skeleton -- black smoke pours from the burning tires -- 

Earl then looks at Booth -

				EARL
		Let's call this sucker in.

									DISSOLVE TO
EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT - LATER

Earl finishes on the mike. 

				EARL	
		...just south of mile marker 		
		87 on Route 9.  

				TRUDY (O.S.)
		Roger that.

Earl hangs up, walking over to Booth as he checks around the van with his flashlight -- 
			
				BOOTH
		If this was a drug deal, where
		are the drugs?

Earl lights up a MENTHOL CIGARETTE and contemplates the night sky, inspired -- 

				EARL
		First thing I'm going to do is
		check out that new casino, 
		whatever the hell itís called.
		Get a nice suite for myself, 
		some high-priced hookers and 
		some slow-roasted prime rib! 

Booth turns and looks at him, angrily -- 

				BOOTH
		What are you talking about!  
		We have a deal!






				EARL
		When the time comes, that is.
			(Beat, overjoyed)
		Hallelujah Booth!  We are rich!
			(shouting)
		RICH!

Earl slaps Booth on the back, Booth smiles -- 

				BOOTH
		Shhh!

				EARL
		What are you gonna do?

				BOOTH
		Well, I don't know.  
			(Beat)
		I'm putting it out of my mind
		and you should too -- 

Suddenly the air is pierced by the SOUND OF PHLEGMY 
CHOKING -- 

Booth and Earl freeze -- 

				EARL
		What the hell was that?

The two men look around -- the sound is coming from behind the Mercedes -- 

Earl and Booth runs over and stop dead in their tracks -- 

DENNING has rolled over on to his back, struggling to breathe -- his eyes are clear as he 
stares back at the two men -- he tries to speak but it is more of an agonized 
gurgle -

				EARL
		Can you hear me? 

Denning struggles to talk but can't, he nods -- 

				BOOTH
			(panicked)
		Oh shit!

Earl gets down closer to Denning -- 

				BOOTH
		What's he trying to say!!
		

				EARL
		I don't know!  Son of a bitch!  
		Who the hell are you?

				BOOTH
		He saw everything!

Grabbing him -- 

				EARL
			(to Denning)
		How long you been lying there 
		playing possum with us, huh?  
		Answer me!

				BOOTH
		He'll tell them everything to save 
		his ass. That's how they all work 
		it!
			
Earl turns and looks to Booth -- Booth stares back at him -- 

				EARL
		No...no!  No way!
			(clenches fist)
		That money is in our hands!

Earl grabs Denning who stares back at him, mute -- 

				EARL
		What did you hear!  How much did 
		you hear!

Earl kicks the dirt in a rage -- 

				EARL
		Shit!

Booth looks at Denning.  Earl snarls. 

				EARL
		We're gonna have to get rid of
		him.

Booth and Earl look at each other -- 

Then Booth looks around him anxiously, panic beginning to form in his mind.  He's beginning 
to understand what Earl means. 

				EARL
		I'm not letting some gangbanger
		send me to jail.  We can't risk it.

				BOOTH
		What are you thinking?

Earl looks at Denning, who looks pleadingly back at him -- 

				EARL
		I don't know...

				BOOTH
		You're thinking about killing him.
			(backing up)
		I can't do that.  No way.  I've
		never killed a man.  Never even
		shot at one...

				EARL
		Well neither have I, but it's
		us or him.  If he talks, or
		writes a note, or whatever,
		he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, 
		he's a low life scumbag.  
			(turning to Denning)
		His kind is hardly even human 
		anyway.

				BOOTH
		I...I can't do that.

				EARL
		Okay then.  I'll do it.

				BOOTH
		That's not what I mean.  

				EARL
		Listen. Do you want to go to jail?  
		Taking evidence, tampering with a 
		crime scene.  You know what
		they'd do.  

Earl looks at Booth.  Stares hard.  Booth looks down. 

				BOOTH
		He would have done it to us, 
		right?

Booth looks at him -- Earl waits a moment, then rips off his jacket and looks at Booth -- 






				EARL
		Exactly.
			(grabbing Booth's 
			 shoulders)
		This is our little secret,
		partner.

Booth nods.  Earl crumples the jacket into a ball and squats down, jamming the coat down 
hard on Denning's face -- 

				EARL
		No one's gonna miss your ass
		anyhow!

Denning begins to struggle -- 

				EARL
		Dammit help me out here!

Booth hesitates.  

				EARL
		Come on, Booth!

Finally, Booth restrains Denning while Earl presses down with all his might on Denning's face.  
Booth turns his head away.

Denning struggles violently -- 

The men struggle to suffocate Denning -- then Booth perks up, hears something -- 

Soon the faint sound of SIRENS gets louder -- 

				BOOTH
		They're coming!

HIGH SHOT - A small group of lights closes on the gas station --

Earl hears the sirens and furiously crushes the coat down on Denning's face -- but Denning 
keeps fighting -- 

				EARL
		Dammit!

The LIGHTS of the cars soon are visible to both of them -- 

An AMBULANCE is followed by a PATROL CAR and a FIRE 
ENGINE -- 

In the nick of time Earl rips the coat away and lays it out on the ground -- 
Booth looks over his shoulder to see the oncoming vehicles -
 
Earl pulls Denning onto the coat as the vehicles pull up -- 

The PARAMEDIC runs over to Earl -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		What do we have?

				EARL
		Uh, we got a live one here,
		shot in the throat -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		Clear me!

Earl stands up and looks down at Denning -- 

Denning stares back up at him, the hate in his eyes going to glass -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		Where's the ambu bag?!

Dwayne Hogan gets out of the patrol car with Jesse -- 

He approaches Booth as another PARAMEDIC assists the first in stabilizing Denning -- 

				DWAYNE
		What the hell happened here?

				BOOTH
		Looks like some kind of drug
		deal or something, they're not
		from around here -- 
			(looking back at Denning)
		one of them's still alive.

Earl stands above the paramedics -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		Did you move him?

				EARL
		Uh, well he sort of moved himself.
		I was trying to stabilize him,
		clear his throat -- 

Fireman douse the car as Dwayne, Jesse and Booth approach Earl -- 

Booth and Earl play it cool as the paramedics work -- 

				PARAMEDIC 
		He's lost a lot of oil -- can you
		hear me buddy?
				
				DWAYNE
		Maybe he can tell us just what the
		hell happened here.

				PARAMEDIC
		Look at me buddy -- focus!

Denning's eyes continue to glaze over -- the paramedics get him on to a backboard as they use 
a resuscitating bag to give him oxygen -- 

				EARL
		Is he going to make it? 

				PARAMEDIC
		I don't know. I'm getting no radial
		pulse!

The paramedics hoist Denning up and toward the ambulance -- 

Earl watches them, looks at Booth -- 

Booth stands with Dwayne and Jesse and looks back at Earl -- 

				DWAYNE
		I'd like to know what they were 
		doing in my town!
			(to Booth)
		Did you get ID off any of them?

				BOOTH
		None of them had any -- 

The paramedics open the ambulance door and load Denning in -- Earl follows them --  the first 
paramedic gets on the radio -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		OK notify the trauma center team 
		our ETA is twenty-five minutes -- 

				PARAMEDIC 2
			(feeling Denning's 
			 neck)
		Oh shit.  I'm losing the carotid 
		pulse!

				PARAMEDIC
		Stand by.

The first paramedic assists the second -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		Lift the legs!  Come on buddy, 
		fight!

Earl watches -- 

				EARL
		Come on...buddy...

				PARAMEDIC 2
		We're losing him!

CLOSE on Earl -- 

				EARL
			(to himself)
		Come on...come on...

The paramedics begin to administer chest compressions -

				PARAMEDIC
		Come on buddy fight!  Fight!

The paramedics continue in vain -- 

Earl watches, clutching his fists at his side -- 

				PARAMEDIC 2
		He's not going to make it -- 

In another part of the crime scene, Dwayne aims his flashlight at the ground, looking for clues - 
his eyes seem to display a keen ability to find inconsistencies - 

Soon he nears the spot where Denning relieved himself - he shines his flashlight down - 

He locates some FOOTPRINTS, those of Denning, leading away from the scene into the grass -   

Dwayne notices the footprints and aims his flashlight into the grass - seeing nothing, 
he turns the light off and heads back to the others - 

Dwayne approaches Booth, Jesse, and the paramedic --- 

Earl and Booth look at each other -- 

				PARAMEDIC
		He's gone.  We lost him.


				BOOTH
			(takes a deep breath)
		Damn.

				DWAYNE
		I want to get some hounds down
		here.

				EARL
		Why?

				DWAYNE
		Cause we got footprints leading 
		into that brush, I want to see
		where it leads...
			(Beat)
		Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you 
		I've never seen carnage like this 
		in all my seventeen years of 
		sheriffing these parts.
			(Beat, spits)
		I don't like it.  Not in my 
		jurisdiction.

Dwayne heads toward camera as Earl and booth watch him -- 

				DWAYNE
		This is gonna be in the papers,
		fellas.

Booth and Earl look at each other grimly -- 

			     DWAYNE
		I'll finish up here.
									DISSOLVE TO
EXT ROAD -- NIGHT

Booth and Earl's patrol car drives down the highway, away from the scene -- 

INT PATROL CAR -- NIGHT

Booth and Earl say nothing for a stretch -- 

				EARL
		I tell you it was a miracle the
		way things turned out -- 

				BOOTH
		I don't want to hear about miracles
		and God and all that!  We tried
		to murder someone to cover our
		asses!

				EARL
		Well we didn't kill him, he died
		on his own.

Booth flashes a totally unconvinced look at Earl and looks back at the road -- 

EXT DIRT ROAD -- NIGHT

The patrol car pulls up past the camera.

EXT. TRAILER HOME -- DAY.

The patrol car comes to a stop in front of Booth's trailer.

INT PATROL CAR ON DIRT ROAD -- NIGHT

Booth looks at Earl -- 

				BOOTH
		Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is
		going to be a big story.  So big in
		fact that I don't want to even have
		this money around.

				EARL
		Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.

				BOOTH
		Forget it.  We're going to bury it,
		and we're not going to even think
		about it until everything dies down.
			(Beat)
		And no one, I mean no one hears a
		word about it.	 Understand?

Earl looks at Booth for a beat -- 

				EARL
		Deal.

EXT BURIAL SITE ABOVE BOOTH'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

The men are on the hilltop above Booth's place.  The lights of the trailer below, and the 
full moon above, are the only sources of illumination.

The men carry the bag of money to a hole they have finished digging -- 

They lower it into the hole and Booth prepares to tape up the top -- 

Earl stops him, takes a pinch of bills out of one of the packets -

				EARL	
		A little won't hurt us.

Earl looks at Booth as he gives him $600 -- Booth accepts it, looks at him -- 

				EARL
		We're even.			

POV of Booth and Earl looking down at the money.  They begin to shovel the earth back in, 
darkening the frame until it is black -- 
									FADE OUT
									FADE IN

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- DAY

CLOSE on a ringing phone near a clock radio reading 
3:30 PM -- 

Sally answers the phone -- 

				SALLY 
		Hi.

				BOOTH(V.O.)
		Hi.

				SALLY
		Heard you had quite a night.

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Booth is on the phone, looking out the window at the hilltop behind his place, where the 
money lies buried.

BOOTH'S POV of the hilltop burial site.

				BOOTH
		Yeah.  

				SALLY(V.O.)
		It was all over the local news.  
		Dwayne was there, acting all 
		official.

				BOOTH
			(Beat)
		I know.		


				SALLY(V.O.)
			(Beat)
		What's wrong?

				BOOTH
		Nothing.

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- DAY

				BOOTH(V.O.)
		Nothing's wrong.

				SALLY
		Oh.  You coming by tonight?

				BOOTH(V.O.)
		OK.

				SALLY
		Are you sure you're OK?

				BOOTH(V.O.)
		Yeah I'm fine.

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

				BOOTH
		I'm just tired is all.  I'll see 
		you tonight OK baby?

				SALLY(V.O.)
		OK.  I love you.

				BOOTH
		I love you too.

Booth hangs up the phone and looks out the window again -- 

INT SHERIFF'S STATION -- DAY

Booth walks into the station -- he looks ahead, surprised by what he sees -- 

Earl is sitting with Dwayne and an attractive woman in her late 30's, ELLEN MARTIN -- 

				DWAYNE
		Booth I'm glad you're here we've
		been waiting for you.

Booth approaches -- 



				DWAYNE
		This is Agent Ellen Martin.
			(Beat)
		She's with the DEA.

Booth looks at Earl for a split second then shakes Martin's hand -- 

				BOOTH
		How are ya?

				MARTIN
		Hello.

				DWAYNE
		I guess we can get started.

				MARTIN
		I wanted to ask you some questions
		about last night.

				BOOTH
		Sure.
			(calmly)
 		We've all got questions about what
		happened.

Earl pulls out his menthol cigarettes, and lights one up -- 

				MARTIN
		Would you mind not smoking?

Earl looks at Dwayne, and Booth, then back at Martin -

				EARL
		No problem.

Earl drops the cigarette on the ground -- 

				MARTIN
		Thank you.
			(Beat)
		Now, do you remember seeing any 
		vehicles traveling near the site, 
		on your way to or from?

				BOOTH
		No.  Why?

				MARTIN
		Because someone may have gotten 
		away.  


				EARL
		What makes you say that?

				DWAYNE
		We had hounds down at the scene,
		the footprint trail was a bust.
		And there were no other tire
		tracks in the vicinity.

Martin looks at the men. 

				MARTIN
		I understand that.  But from 
		what we know, there was a 
		large sum of money involved in 
		the transaction, about three 
		million dollars.
			(beat)
		It seems to have disappeared.

Booth whistles at the amount --

				BOOTH
		Could it have been in the 
		Mercedes?

				MARTIN
		Maybe.  That's where it was 
		during Denning's last report.

Earl shifts in his chair. 

				DWAYNE
		Denning's their man on the 
		inside.

Martin pulls a photo out of a file in front of her.  Hands it over.

				MARTIN
		He was the man you tried to save 
		last night. Agent Paul Denning.  
		We were working together.
			(sighs, long beat)
		He was deep undercover with these
		dealers for a while.  They ran a 
		big operation in Arizona, Nevada, 
		California.  

Earl fights to play it cool as Dwayne listens to Martin, captivated.  Booth looks to be in 
the worst shape of all, sickened by the revelation.


				MARTIN
		Normally we would have tracked him
		with a wiretap, but it was standard
		for him to occasionally drop out
		when working with these guys. The
		last we heard from him was two days
		ago.

				BOOTH
		You mean that guy was an agent?

				MARTIN
		Yes.  Wife and a kid.  
			(Beat)
		Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You 
		did all you could.  You have our
		deepest gratitude...and my personal
		thanks.

A pregnant pause envelopes the room --  
		
				MARTIN
		In fact, I've asked Sheriff Hogan
		for permission to enter a
		letter of commendation in each 
		of your files.
			(beat)
		Agent Denning was a good man.
		I served with him for nearly
		five years...

Booth looks at Earl, hard.  Earl decides to break the silence.

				EARL
		So I guess we won't find out 
		what happened.

Martin gets up -- 

				MARTIN
		Well, we have one lead and that's 
		what I'm looking into next.

				BOOTH
		What's that?

				MARTIN
		Denning was wearing a bug. 

Booth and Earl look at each other -- Dwayne gets up. 



				MARTIN
		He kept a recording of all such 
		transactions in order to keep 
		track of who's who, what was said, 
		what's happening.  I contacted your 
 		local coroner, and he found it taped 
		to his back.

				DWAYNE
		That's news to me.  So it's over at
		Jesse's office?

				MARTIN
		Yeah.  I told him I'd be there 
		before five.

				DWAYNE
		Excellent. I'll go down with you.

Dwayne looks at Booth and Earl -- 

				DWAYNE
		You boys coming?

Booth and Earl watch the two get ready to leave -- 

				EARL
		We'll follow in our car.

									DISSOLVE TO 
EXT ROAD -- DAY

Dwayne's patrol car zooms down the road -- soon Booth and Earl's follows -- 

INT PATROL CAR -- DAY

Booth and Earl drive, completely panicked.

				BOOTH
		We're dead.  We're dead, 
		We are dead...
			(beat)
		What are we going to do?!

				EARL
		I don't know...

				BOOTH
		This isn't a joke. What are
		we going to do!



				EARL
		I don't know you want me to put 
		on my cape and fly there?!
			(Beat)
		We're going to play it cool...
		besides there might be nothing 
		on that tape anyway...

				BOOTH
		That guy was a Federal agent.
		An officer of the law, just like 
		us.

				EARL
		Well, we didn't know that at
		the time.

				BOOTH
		We assaulted a Federal agent.  We
		killed him.

			 	EARL
		No we didn't.  He died on his own.

				BOOTH
		Oh, right, with a little help from
		his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure
		that's gonna fly real far when they
		hear that tape...

A horrible pause.  Then Booth finally says it.

				BOOTH
		We gotta turn ourselves in, before 
		they hear the tape.

				EARL
		Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for 
		sure.  There's no way we're doin' 
		that, you understand?  No way.

				BOOTH
		It's the right thing to do.

				EARL
		It's the stupid thing to do, 
		that's what it is.

Booth considers for a moment.  Relents.

				BOOTH
		I should have known something like
		this was going to happen!  

				EARL
		Man take it easy!  You're sweating
		like crazy!  

Booth takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down - 

				EARL
		Whatever happens, don't lose your 
		cool.

EXT STREET -- DAY 

The car drives off -- 

INT CORONER'S OFFICE -- DAY

CLOSE on a pair of hands holding a PLASTIC EVIDENCE BAG -- inside the bag is a small TAPE 
RECORDER and a small MICROPHONE attached to a wire -- 

Jesse hands the bag to Ellen Martin -- Dwayne scrutinizes the contents -- 

Booth gets a glass of water and drinks it down -- 

Earl watches as Martin opens the bag -- 

				MARTIN
		All right gentlemen -- maybe this
		will shed some light on what 
		took place.

Martin rewinds the tape and we hear noise on the tape. 

Dwayne is excited by the event, hoping to get some 
answers -- he looks at Booth and Earl.

				DWAYNE
		It's kind of like those black boxes
		on the planes, you know, like the
		last seconds?  I figure most of what
		they hear is "AAAAAAAAAAAGH!"
			(laughs)
		What do you think?

Not amused, Booth and Earl force smiles -- 

				EARL
		I don't know.

				DWAYNE
		This just might be our ticket!


Martin and Jesse look at Dwayne -- just then the tape 
stops -- 

CLOSE on Booth, who looks as if he might start trembling -- 

Earl sniffs, tries to play it cool but there is real fear in his eyes -- 

Martin looks at the two men for a beat, then -- 

CLOSE on Martin's thumb as she presses down the small PLAY button -- 

Dwayne perks up -- 

Jesse perks up -- 

Booth swallows hard -- 

Earl sniffs again -- the tape starts -- 

It is STATIC.  Martin lets it play for a while -- Dwayne soon appears confused -- 

				DWAYNE
		What the hell?

Martin fast forwards -- more static -- 

				MARTIN
		That's odd.

Booth and Earl look at each other -- 

Martin fast forwards again -- static.

				JESSE
		Maybe the microphone was damaged.

				MARTIN
		Looks OK to me...

Martin fast forwards again -- static.  She lets it play.

				MARTIN
		Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe
		the lab can pick something up.

				DWAYNE
		Damn!  
				MARTIN
		I'm sorry to have dragged you all 
		the way down here for that.  I 
		thought maybe it would help.
Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved -- 

				EARL
		What other leads did you come up
		with?

				MARTIN
		Not too many.  But we're still 
		collecting evidence from the scene.

				DWAYNE
		Well we'd like to help you in any 
		way we can.  We're all in this 
		together, as law enforcement 
		officers.

				MARTIN
		We appreciate that.

The tape continues to play static -- 

									DISSOLVE TO
INT HALLWAY -- DAY

Booth and Earl exit the coroner's office, into the busy hallway of central police headquarters 
-- Earl gestures into the room -- 			

				EARL
		We'll be seeing you.

Booth and Earl walk down the hallway, saying nothing until they come to a rear exit -- 

EXT CENTRAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHTFALL

The two men exit -- Booth leans against the wall and Earl bends down, resting his hands on 
his knees -- 

Soon Earl laughs weakly.  Booth does the same.  Soon they are laughing in a wild burst of 
relief -- 

The two men look at each other -- 

				BOOTH
		So what are you doing tonight 
		partner?

The two men laugh even harder -- 

				EARL
		I'm going out partner.  How 'bout 
		you?
				BOOTH
		Me too.
										CUT TO
INT CROWDED BAR -- NIGHT

PAN a crowded bar -- 

MONTAGE of Earl living it up.  Music blares as he treats friends and attractive women to 
drinks, dances, lives it 
up, all the time paying cash -- 

										CUT TO
EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

Long shot of the front of the house, somewhere in the city of Las Vegas.  A sheriff's car 
is parked out front.

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dwayne is dressed in his bowling shirt, standing outside a bathroom door.  His face is red, 
and his voice is soft and slightly slurred -- he pauses for a beat before saying anything --

				DWAYNE
		Come on...I'm sorry.  Really I am.
			(beat)
		Won't you open the door?
		
The door opens, AND THERE IS SALLY.  She is hesitant, and her cheek is slightly swollen.

				DWAYNE
		I'd never do anything to hurt
		you.  You know that, right?

Sally nods, her head slightly bowed.

				DWAYNE
		You just mind that sarcasm. and
		I'll mind my manners.  Deal?

She nods again.  Satisfied, Dwayne reaches down, picks up his bowling bag.

				DWAYNE
		Now I'll be back by 10, for the
		kiss-and-make-up part.  You
		don't have to wait up.  I'll
		wake ya.
				
And with that, he's out the door.


EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

Dwayne gets in his car, driving past a few others parked along the street.  As soon as he turns, 
the headlights on one of the cars turn on, and it drives to house and stops.

INT HOGAN LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Booth opens the door without knocking.  He carries a package inside.

				BOOTH
		Sally?

There's no answer.

				BOOTH
		Sally?  I was beginning
		to think he wasn't gonna leave.

				SALLY
			(o.s., cheery)
		I'm in here.

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Booth enters, as Sally turns from the makeup mirror to greet him.  The bruise is fairly covered, 
and her smile hides it well.

Booth holds out the package.

				SALLY
		You got me something?  What's
		the occasion?

				BOOTH
		You deserve it is the occasion.

Sally opens the box -- her eyes widen as she takes out several articles of very sexy, 
and expensive, LINGERIE -- 

				BOOTH
		I tell you I got hard in the 
		store thinking about you in these!

Sally and Booth burst out laughing -- they kiss.  

Booth looks hard into her eyes, and suddenly his expression changes.  He's seen the bruise.


				BOOTH
		What happened to your cheek?
				SALLY
		Oh I...nothing...

				BOOTH
		Nothing happened?

				SALLY
		Dwayne got a little tipsy is all.
		He doesn't handle pressure well.
			(Beat)
		It's over.

Booth's eyes narrow.

				BOOTH
		Like hell it's over.  You
		told me he wasn't doing this
		anymore.

				SALLY
		He's not, he's...

				BOOTH
		That son of a bitch. 

				SALLY
		Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing.
		It's not worth it.  Remember
		what happened the last time?

Booth looks away.

				SALLY
		Let's not get into this again.
		I know him.  If you said something,
		he'd take it out on me.

				BOOTH
		And I'd take it out on him.

				SALLY
		And I'd end up a widow in two
		ways.  
			(beat)
		Let's forget it.  I'll
		just be a little more careful 
		next time.

				BOOTH
		There isn't gonna be a next time.
		We're gonna get out of here.



				SALLY
		And go where?  He'd find me. I 
		know you don't think so, but he 
		would.

Booth thinks for a beat.
		
				BOOTH
		What if we could go really, really
		far?

Sally tries to put an end to it, with a change of tactic.

				SALLY
		We don't have to.  We've got
		everything we need right here.

Sally wraps her arms around Booth, kissing him deeply.  Then she looks down at the package 
in her hand.

				SALLY
		Baby...this must have been 
		expensive. 

He doesn't want to give in, but Sally's made up her mind.  

				BOOTH
		You're worth every last penny.

				SALLY
		Well, I can't let you down now, 
		can I?

Sally seductively touches his chest, and walks off with the lingerie -- 

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Booth sits on the edge of the bed, watching -- 

Sally comes out, dressed up in the sexy outfit: bra, panties, garter belt, stockings -- 

Booth watches her as she approaches him -- 

She seductively straddles him, kisses him full on the lips, then the neck, the chest...out of 
frame -- Booth reacts accordingly at the right moment -- 
										CUT TO
INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- LATER

Booth is now on top, as the two go at it like animals, Sally's legs wrapped around him -- 

They both climax, and Booth kisses Sally -- Sally looks at him and smiles -- 

				SALLY
		Dwayne's gonna love me in this.

Booth looks at her -- 

				SALLY
		It's a joke, silly.

The two kiss some more -- soon the sound of VOICES rises faintly, high treble.  

				EARL(V.O.)
		How long you been lying there 
		playing possum with us, huh?  
		Answer me!

				BOOTH(V.O.)
		He'll tell them everything to save 
		his ass. That's how they all work 
		it!
	
It slowly gets louder -- 		

				EARL(V.O.)
		No...no!  No way! That money is in 
		our  hands!  What did you hear!  
		How much did you hear!

									DISSOLVE TO
INT JESSE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

PAN a dimly lit room, as the sounds of the voices get clearer, though the sound is poor -- 

				EARL(V.O.)
		Shit!
			(Beat)
		We're gonna have to get rid of
		him.
			(coldly)
		I'm not letting some gangbanger
		ruin my life.  We can't risk it.

				BOOTH(V.O)
		What are you thinking?

				EARL(V.O.)
		I don't know...

As the camera continues to pan we see the voices are coming from a small TAPE RECORDER -- 
				BOOTH(V.O.)
		You're thinking about killing him.
		I can't do that.  No way.  I've
		never killed a man.  Never even
		shot at one.

				EARL (V.O)
		Well neither have I, but it's us
		or him.  If he talks, or writes a 
		note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us 
		in.  Besides, he's just a low life 
		scumbag.  His kind is hardly even 
		human anyway.

				BOOTH (V.O.)
		I can't do that.

				EARL (V.O.)
		Okay then.  I'll do it.

Soon a hand approaches the recorder -- 

				BOOTH (V.O.)
		That's not what I mean.

				EARL (V.O.)
		Listen.  Do you want to go to jail?
		Taking evidence, tampering with a 
		crime scene.  You know what they'd 
		do.

				BOOTH (V.O.)
		He would have done it to us, right?

				EARL(V.O.)
		Exactly.  This is our little secret,
		partner.

The hand shuts off the tape and we see the listener is  Jesse the coroner, who has a determined 
look in his glassy eyes as he takes a swig of BOURBON -- 

									FADE OUT
									FADE IN

INT GARAGE -- DAY

The burned-out Mercedes sits in the center of the room -- 

Ellen Martin looks at it with forensic expert JOE WALLACE, a man in his 40s wearing thick glasses -- 



				WALLACE
		You want to hear the good news
		first, or the bad news?

				MARTIN
		Give me the bad news.

				WALLACE
		We retrieved a few things from the
		trunk, including a steamer trunk, 
		or the remnants of a trunk, the 
		brass clips and so forth.  

				MARTIN
		Anything in it?

				WALLACE
		Money.

Martin looks at Wallace -- 

				WALLACE
		But nowhere near three million
		dollars worth.  I would say
		maybe twenty thousand.

				MARTIN
			(bluntly)
		There was more than that.

				WALLACE
		Not in the trunk.

				MARTIN
		That doesn't tell us much. Did
		you run a check on the gas like
		I told you?

				WALLACE
		Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded,
		high octane.  

				MARTIN
		So...what's the good news?

				MARTIN
		The car's a diesel.  

Again, Martin looks at Wallace -





				WALLACE
		That fire was set.  Deliberately.
		And probably not by anyone found
		at the scene.
			
				MARTIN
		So someone did get away.

				WALLACE
		I don't know how else you'd explain
		it.  The coroner's estimated time of
		death for everyone there was long
		before this fire started, unless of
		course Denning started it, and that
		doesn't make much sense.

				MARTIN
		No, it doesn't.  Neither does his 
		blank tape.  Any news on that?

				WALLACE
		We're doing a check on the 
		manufacturers'	serial number, see 
		if there were other defective tapes 
		in the bunch.
			(Beat)
		What's your take on these local
		boys?  Are they providing any
		answers?

Martin seems deep in thought -- a skeptical look crosses her eyes --

				MARTIN
		No.  I don't think they see much
		of this kind of thing.
			(Beat)
		But they're going to.

									DISSOLVE TO
SHERIFF'S STATION -- DAY

Jesse looks out the window of the station -- 

				JESSE
		I suppose no man can judge another's
		actions unless he has been in the
		same situation himself, presented 
		with the same temptations.
			(beat)
		And money sure is tempting.  Hell,
		some people will pretty much do 
		anything for money...lie, cheat, 
		steal, swindle...
Jesse turns and looks --  

Booth and Earl listen to him, grim expressions on their faces.

				JESSE
		...kill.
			(beat)
		I don't suppose it would be too 
		hard to kill a man, especially if 
		he's half dead, especially if he's 
		of the criminal persuasion.
			(beat)
		How did you know he was a federal 
		officer with a wife, and a baby on 
		the way?

Earl and Booth say nothing.  Jesse laughs -- 

				JESSE
		You gentlemen look like you're
		about to toss your collective
		cookies.

				BOOTH
		Why don't you get to the point.

				JESSE
		My point, well...

Jesse gets up -- 

				JESSE
		Hey we're all friends, right?  
		Friends don't squeal on friends, 
		that's not what Jesse Segundo is 
		all about.

				EARL
		Then what the hell are you all 
		about?

Jesse looks hard at Earl -- 

				JESSE
		Listen Earl.  I covered for you.  
		For both of you.  I put my ass on 
		the line to save yours, so don't
		pull a hostile tone with me!

				BOOTH
			(resigned)
		What's your offer, Jesse?

				JESSE
		My offer?  Well I'd say it's a
		fair one, like I said we're
		friends.  All I want is my share,
		which I guess is...

Booth and Earl watch Jesse as he fast-forwards through the tape until he comes to -- 

				JESSE
		I think it's around here...

Jesse then plays -- 

				EARL(V.O.)
		"Two million eight hundred thousand
		sweet mother we're millionaires."

Jesse clicks the tape off -- 

				JESSE
		I'll settle for a third of that.

				EARL
		And if we refuse?  Your tampering 
		with evidence isn't exactly a 
		misdemeanor, did you ever consider 
		that?

				JESSE
		True, but neither is attempted murder.
		In fact I'd say that's considerably
		worse, wouldn't you, Earl?

Earl says nothing -- 

				JESSE
		Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The 
		tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You 
		can buy 'em at any store.  There's 
		no way they can pin anything on me.	

				BOOTH
		All right, Jesse, we'll play it your
		way, under one condition.

				JESSE
		I'm all ears.

				BOOTH
		We're going to wait.  All of us, 
		until everything dies down.


				JESSE
		Well, I don't know...
	
				BOOTH
		That's the deal.  If you don't 
		like it, forget it, no one wins.

Jesse looks at Booth -- 

				JESSE
		Ok...I'll wait.  For now.
		But I'm going to need a little
		advance, to oil the wheels, so 
		to speak.

				BOOTH
		How much?

				JESSE
			(pondering)
		I understand your logic, Booth, 
		but I don't think...two thousand's 
		going to raise any eyebrows, do 
		you?

				BOOTH
		Two thousand...

				JESSE
			(sternly)
		By Friday.

EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

The lights are on in the house -- 

INT HOGAN LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Holding a remote, Sally flips through the channels, stopping on a "Lifestyles of the Rich 
and Famous" type show -- 

POV of the television -- high-life on the Riviera -- 

Dwayne enters, popping open a can of BEER -- it overflows a bit, and Dwayne sucks up the 
overflow -- 

				DWAYNE
		Son of a bitch!  Did you
		drop these?

Sally looks at him and then back at the screen -- 



				SALLY
		Careful not to get any on the 
		floor.

Dwayne puts the beer on a table next to his chair -- 

Dwayne gingerly lowers himself into his chair, appearing to have pain in his lower back -

Dwayne notices what's on TV and seems mildly disappointed -- 

				DWAYNE
		What's this?

				SALLY
		I don't know...

Sally watches the luxurious scenes on the TV -- 

			DWAYNE
		Is this all that's on?

She gets up and hands him the remote -- 

				SALLY
		Here, watch what you want.  I'm 
		going to take a shower.

Sally heads out of the room and Dwayne watches her leave -- he then starts surfing channels, 
takes another sip of his beer, shifts uncomfortably in his chair, winces a bit -- 

INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Having undressed, Sally wraps a towel around her and walks into the bathroom -- 
the sound of the shower begins -- 

INT HOGAN LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

CLOSE on Dwayne's hand flattening his empty beer can -- 

Dwayne belches loudly -- he then shifts in his chair again -- his back is really bothering him -- 

				DWAYNE 	
		Damn it.

Dwayne gets up and walks offscreen into the kitchen, holding his back -- we hear drawers 
opening and closing -- 

				DWAYNE
		Aw, where the hell is that thing...


INT HOGAN BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Dwayne closes his closet door -- irritated, he goes to the closed bathroom door -- 

				DWAYNE
		Hey where's the hot pad?

				SALLY(O.S.)
		What?

				DWAYNE
		Where's the hot back -- the 
		therapeutic pad thing?

				SALLY(O.S.)
		I can't hear a word you're saying!

				DWAYNE
		Forget it.

Dwayne checks in a dresser, then opens a closet, begins to dig through boxes on a shelf -- 

Dwayne pulls out a CORD which is attached to a HOT PAD -- as he pulls it out some articles 
fall off the shelf onto the ground, including a SHOE BOX -- 	

Dwayne looks at the ground -- 

A LACE STRAP pokes out of the box -

Dwayne crouches down, slowly takes the lid off -- we hear the sound of the shower stop and 
Sally getting out of the 
shower -- 

Dwayne lifts up the EXPENSIVE LINGERIE and looks at it with a frown -- 

				DWAYNE
		What the hell?...

He lifts up the individual garments, turning them around -- 

The bathroom door opens and Sally comes out in a towel and robe -- she freezes and looks at 
Dwayne, playing it cool -

Dwayne looks back at her -- 

Sally approaches him -- 

				SALLY
		What are you digging around in my
		closet for?
				DWAYNE
		I was looking for the hot pad!

Sally goes to grab the lingerie out of Dwayne's hand -- he refuses to let go -- 

				DWAYNE
		You mind telling me where the hell
		this came from? 
			(Beat)
		Is there something I don't know 
		about? 

Sally looks Dwayne in the eye and fights to be casual, acting merely irritated -

				SALLY
		What do you mean?

Dwayne looks hard at her -- 

				DWAYNE
		I mean are you spending my money
		on other things I don't know
		about?  Got any furs in there?

Mildly relieved, Sally grabs the lingerie out of Dwayne's hand and stuffs it back in the box -- 

				SALLY
		Don't be ridiculous!  It wasn't
		so expensive!

Sally puts the box back -- 

				SALLY
		It was going to be a surprise!

				DWAYNE
		A surprise huh?  Well I don't like 
		any surprises, especially if 
		I'm forking over the loot for 
		them!

Sally closes the door and looks at him for a beat before laughing weakly and walking away 
from him -- 

				SALLY
		You're a real smooth talker, you
		know that?

Sally goes to the mirror and combs her hair out -- 


				DWAYNE
		What are you saying?

				SALLY
		I'm saying you're about as romantic 
		as a bag of sand.

				DWAYNE
			(menacing)
		Watch that.  Watch that tone.

Dwayne looks at her with a surly but suspicious expression on his face, then dismisses the 
exchange and leaves with his hot pad. 

When he's gone, Sally looks at herself in the mirror with a troubled expression on her face -- 

EXT TRAILER HOME -- NIGHTFALL

Booth and Earl's PATROL CAR is parked next to the trailer.

EXT BURIAL SITE ABOVE BOOTH'S TRAILER -- NIGHT

Standing in front of where the money is buried, Booth crouches down and opens the bag. 

				EARL
		I could kill that no good son of
		a bitch!

				BOOTH
		All right enough!  I'm tired of 
		thinking about all this!

				EARL
		Well I'm not!
			(Beat)
		Thinks he's got us by the balls.

				BOOTH
		Well doesn't he?  Besides if the
		DEA heard that tape we'd be behind
		bars right now.  Just call it
		the cost of doing business.
			(Beat)
		This whole thing is screwed up.
			(Beat)
		I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell
		'em the truth...

Earl gives Booth a "get real" look. Incredulous.
				

				BOOTH
		...Or get rid of the money.  I don't
		know.

				EARL
		I've got a better idea.  All we 
		have to do is straighten out
		Jesse.

				BOOTH 
		And how do you figure we do that?

				EARL
		All we have to do is get our hands
		on the original tape.  We'll set 
		him up somehow.

				BOOTH	
		He's probably made copies.  He's not 
		going to give them up to us.

				EARL
		Forget the copies!  He could have 
		made up the copies -- the only 
		thing that incriminates us is the 
		original.

Booth rifles through the bag -- 

				EARL
		He's going to be trouble.

				BOOTH
		He's a partner now, Earl, like it 
		or not.

Earl looks around -- 

Booth inspects the money, then looks up at Earl -

				BOOTH
		Have you been back here?

Earl looks at him for a beat, guiltily -

				EARL
		Yeah I just took a little out.  
		I'm keeping track of it, you can
		trust me.

Booth gets up. 



				BOOTH
		We had a deal!  What was I, 
		talking to the wall?

				EARL
		For Christ's sake, Booth, I just 
		needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You 
		got my word on it --I'm not going near it 
		again until everything cools down.

Booth looks at Earl for a beat, then proceeds to take out the two thousand for Jesse 
before hastily sealing up the 
bag --

				BOOTH
		You said that last time!

				EARL 
		Well I mean it this time.
			(Beat)
		Come on.  Let's get this over 
		with!

The men begin to fill the hole with dirt -- 
					
									FADE OUT
									FADE IN
EXT WALKING PATH -- DAY

Booth and Sally walk slowly, and close together, down a remote, scenic walking path -

				SALLY
		I told him I bought the lingerie, 
		as a surprise.  I don't think he
		suspects anything, but now you
		know, if he mentions it. 

				BOOTH
		How the hell did he find it?

				SALLY
		He started digging through my 
		closet, something he never does.

				BOOTH
		Great...
			
				SALLY
		It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.

				BOOTH
		Let's hope so.  
				SALLY
		If he asks me again, I'm gonna
		tell him I returned it all.

				BOOTH
		Dammit, I'm so sick of this.		

				SALLY
			(sighs)
		I know.

				BOOTH
		Every night I think about you
		sleeping with him, him slobbering
		all over you.

				SALLY
		He doesn't slobber, he just snores.
		And I told you we haven't...done 
		anything in over a year.

				BOOTH
		It doesn't matter...he's next to 
		you.
			(Beat)
		You know, I always say to myself, 
		you should have left him years ago.
		Why didn't you?

				SALLY
		I used to think he was something,
		once...
			(Beat)  
		I was eighteen, I didn't know
		any better, and he had something 
		steady to offer.

Booth shakes his head to himself --

				SALLY
		You get into a routine, after a few
		years, when the thrill was gone, I
		just said to myself this is my
		destination, I guess.

Sally looks at Booth --

				SALLY
		And then I met you.

Booth looks back at her --



				BOOTH
		Let's just get out of here, get 
		out of this -- place.  We'll drop 
		out, get a house have some kids, 
		get a satellite dish...

				SALLY
		I hate it when you talk like this.
			(beat)
		Go on.  

				BOOTH
		We'd... I don't know...go to 
		California, New York, maybe a 
		house on a Swiss mountainside...

				SALLY
		It'd have to be Switzerland to 
		make sure Dwayne never finds us.

				DWAYNE
		Whatever it takes...

Sally stops walking -- 

				SALLY
		What's got into you?

Booth notices Sally has stopped walking -- he stops and looks at her -- pausing to 
arrange his thoughts -- 

				BOOTH
		I'm bored, you know?  I'm 
		frustrated.  I want it to work 
		for us.

Sally approaches him, and they embrace -- 

				SALLY
		So do I.

				BOOTH
			(Beat)
		I love you Sally.

				SALLY
		I love you.

They kiss -- Sally puts her head on his shoulder -- 

				SALLY
		What are we going to do?


				BOOTH
		We're going to figure it out.  It
		won't be long.
			(Beat)
		Trust me.

They kiss again, and Booth puts his arm around her -- 

				SALLY
		A satellite dish?

				BOOTH
		Well I was just throwing out 
		ideas...

They walk down the lane, saying nothing --

EXT VEGAS STRIP - DAY

MONTAGE of all the casinos, the crowds, the glitter - 

EXT RESORT - DAY

At the entrance of one casino, people are seen pulling up, loading and unloading 
luggage, leaving and arriving - 

Slowly a figure emerges from the crowd, alone, walking dejectedly - it is Jesse, who 
walks into the harsh sunlight, oblivious to the people around him - he looks haggard, 
exhausted --

He squints from the glare, puts on his sunglasses and looks down the strip - 

He stands there for a beat, then lets out a prolonged, defeated sigh - 

His PAGER goes off - Jesse reads the number - 

EXT PAYPHONE - DAY

Jesse wipes down his forehead with one hand and digs in his pocket with the other - 
he comes up with a measly handful of change and stuffs it back into his pocket - 
he picks up the phone and dials the operator - 

				JESSE
		I wanna make a collect call...


INT SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

Dwayne approaches a phone - 

				TRUDY(O.S.)
		Line six, chief...

Dwayne presses the appropriate extension and picks up the phone - 

				DWAYNE
		Jesse?

				JESSE(V.O.)
		Yeah whaddya want?.

				DWAYNE

		What the hell are you calling
		collect for?

EXT PAYPHONE - DAY

				JESSE
		I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's
		up?

				DWAYNE(V.O.)
		Vegas!  Can you hightail it back 
		here by three o'clock?

				JESSE
		Why?

INT SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

				DWAYNE
		Well, we got the DEA coming down
		here again, I don't know, sounds
		to me like they got some more
		questions they want to ask us.

				JESSE(V.O.)
			(Beat)
		About what?

				DWAYNE
		Well they really didn't go into
		any details on the phone, but
		they did ask for you, and I 
		figure we should try to help
		them out as best we can.  

EXT PAYPHONE - DAY

				JESSE
			(Beat, looks around)
		Uh, sure.  I hear you.

				DWAYNE(V.O.)
		So be here at three.

				JESSE
		I'll do my best...that doesn't
		give me much time.

				DWAYNE(V.O.)
		I  have complete faith in you.  
		But don't you go speeding.

				JESSE
		Yeah...see you at three.

Jesse hangs up the phone with a concerned expression on his face.

EXT EARL'S MOTHER'S HOUSE -- DAY

A car pulls up and Earl gets out in front of the small Las Vegas house -- he gets the
 mail out of the box and approaches the modest house -- he opens the door and goes 
in -- 

INT EARL'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN -- DAY

Earl walks in with the mail -- Earl's MOTHER is washing dishes.

				EARL
		Hi ma.

				EARL'S MOTHER
		Hi.

She turns off the water and dries her hands -- 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		I didn't know you were coming.

				EARL
		I was in the neighborhood.

				EARL'S MOTHER
		Is that the mail?

				EARL
		Yeah.

Earl's mother inspects the mail -- she seems disappointed.

Earl's mother drops the mail on the counter -- 


				EARL'S MOTHER
		How's work?

				EARL
		Well, same ol' same ol'.

Earl pours himself a glass of MILK from out of the refrigerator - 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		People have been asking me about
		that story in the paper.  I told
		them you were the first person on
		the scene.  They were asking me
		for all the details.

				EARL
		It was pretty gory ma, let me tell
		you.  But you have to turn all
		that off, and do your job, just 
		like pop used to say.
				
				EARL'S MOTHER
		Did they ever find out who they
		were?

				EARL
		Nope. If you're a criminal you don't
		carry ID, and if you do you're a
		damn fool.

				EARL'S MOTHER
		I tell you this world just keeps
		getting more and more violent.

				EARL
		At least around here it does.

				EARL'S MOTHER
			(goes to pantry)
  		Are you hungry?

				EARL
		Yeah sure I'll grab something 
		before I go...
			(Beat)
		Hey -- I've got a surprise.

				EARL'S MOTHER
		You do?

Earl takes a sip of his milk, then smiles at his mother - 


				EARL
		You want to see it?

INT EARL'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Earl carries a large, heavy BOX through the front door and rests it on the ground - 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		What is it?

Earl stands up, stretches his lower back - 

				EARL
		There was this raffle going on 
		at the station, some charity or
		church was running it, I forget,
		so I figure what the hell put in
		my five bucks...

				EARL'S MOTHER
		And what happened?

				EARL
		Well basically I forgot about it,
		you know, you never win these
		things, but this time, well... 

Earl rips the paper off the box to reveal a large WINDOW AIR CONDITIONER - 

				EARL
		I won!

Earl's mother heads over to him, looking at the box -- 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		Well what do you know!  An
		air conditioner.

				EARL
		And not just any air conditioner.
		This baby sells for over six
		hundred dollars retail.
	
				EARL'S MOTHER
		That's great Earl!  

				EARL
		Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, 
		enough to cool off this whole 
		place.


				EARL'S MOTHER
		This whole place?

				EARL
		Yeah.  Figured you could have it.

Earl's mother stares at him for a beat -- 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		Don't you want it?

				EARL
		Ah, hell I'll get one soon
		enough.  Besides, I want you 
		to have it.
	
				EARL'S MOTHER
			(laughs)
		Well I don't know -- 

				EARL
		You've done without it long enough, 
		ma.
		
Earl picks up his milk glass - 				

				EARL
		Just like the commercial says, you
		deserve a break today...

He takes a swig of milk -- 

Earl's mother looks at the air conditioner, pleasantly surprised - 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		We can put it in the living room
		window...
			(Beat)
		This is great Earl. 

Earl's mother hugs him -- 

				EARL'S MOTHER
		Thank you honey.  are you sure
		you don't want it?

				EARL
			(casually)
		Absolutely positively.  




				EARL'S MOTHER
		It will certainly be an improvement...
			(Beat)
		what was the charity again?

Earl sets the glass on a table -- 

				EARL
			(Beat)
		I don't remember.  But I'm glad I 
		gave it a shot.

									DISSOLVE TO 
INT SHERIFF'S STATION -- DAY

Dwayne looks at his watch -- 3:25 -- 

Martin, Booth, Earl, and Dwayne sit in the station -- 

Suddenly Jesse walks through the door, with an ashen expression on his face -- 

				DWAYNE
		Nice of you to join us.  I did say	
		three o'clock, didn't I?

				JESSE
		Well I'm here now.

Booth and Earl react to Jesse's expression as he sits 
down -- 

				JESSE
		What's up?

				MARTIN
		I wanted to meet with you all to
		go over some new information about
		the murders.

				JESSE
		Did you find a suspect?

Martin looks at Jesse -- 

				MARTIN
		Uh, no...
				
				DWAYNE
		Don't you think I would have
		told you that!

				EARL
		Well what is it?
				MARTIN
		We discovered something interesting 
		about the tape Denning was wearing.
			(Beat)
		Based on the serial number, we've 
		determined that the tape was 
		purchased locally.

Jesse swallows.  Hard.

				BOOTH
		Yeah?  So?

				MARTIN
		It's odd.  I don't know how Denning
		had the time, or the ability to
		buy something local, based on his
		situation.

				EARL
		Well I suppose you would know
		more about his situation than us.				

Martin stares at Earl -- 
				
				MARTIN
		Maybe.  Maybe not.

				DWAYNE
		What are you getting at?

				MARTIN
		Well, unfortunately Denning's not
		here to tell us, but I would say
		someone got their hands on that tape
		and switched it.

				DWAYNE
		Why would someone do that?

				MARTIN
		Because they don't want anyone to
		hear what's on it, obviously.  

Martin looks directly at Jesse -- Dwayne turns and does the same -- 

Jesse looks at them -- 

				JESSE
		Well, like you said, he's not
		here to tell us.


				MARTIN
		That's true...that's true.

Just then Martin's beeper goes off -- she reads it -- 

				MARTIN
		Excuse me, I have to make a phone
		call.

Martin goes over to a phone -- 

Dwayne looks at Jesse -- 

				DWAYNE
		Something wrong, Jesse?

				JESSE
		No.  Something wrong with you
		Dwayne?

				DWAYNE
		You walked in here looking like 
		you just ate a shit sandwich.

				JESSE
		Well, I just got a lot of things 
		on my mind is all.

Dwayne shrugs and looks at Booth and Earl -- 

				DWAYNE
		What do you think about all this?

				EARL
		Hell, I don't know.  If I had 
		some input I'd offer it up.

				BOOTH
		We gotta roll anyhow.  How long is 
		this going to take?

Martin hangs up -- 

				DWAYNE
		Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you 
		concerned about all of this?

				BOOTH
		I can't get enough of it.

Martin approaches the men as Booth and Earl get up -

				BOOTH
		Anything else we can do for you?
				MARTIN
		Well, I wanted to ask you a few
		more questions, but I have to go.	
		I'm sorry.

Martin looks at Jesse -- 

				MARTIN
		Thanks for coming down.

				JESSE
		Any time.

				EARL
		We're out of here.

				JESSE
		Right behind you.

Booth, Earl, and Jesse all head out -- 

Martin watches them leave -- Dwayne addresses her -- 

				DWAYNE
		We just got started, where you
		headed off to?

Martin continues to watch the men leave, then turns her attention to Dwayne -

				MARTIN
		Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're
		going to check into something.

				DWAYNE
		Maybe I should come along.

Martin appears reluctant for a moment -- 

				MARTIN
		Don't you have to be here?

				DWAYNE
		Hell no. besides I'm just a radio 
		call away if something happens. I
		feel I should keep abreast of what
		happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction
		and all.

				MARTIN
		Mm-hmm...



				DWAYNE
		Look, agent Martin...

				DWAYNE
		Ellen...

				DWAYNE
		Ellen...
			(Beat)
		I know you might think this is a
		small town, and we do things a 
		certain way, but I don't want you
		to confuse that with...a lack of
		resolve.

Dwayne's expression becomes more determined - 

				DWAYNE
		I don't like people getting away
		from me, and I'm prepared to 
		scour the earth for whoever did it.
		I want you to know that.

Martin and Dwayne look at each other for a beat - Martin then gives Dwayne a faint smile of respect - 

				MARTIN
			(Beat)
		Ok, sure.  Let's go.
	
EXT SHERIFF'S STATION -- DAY

Booth and Earl exit and Jesse approaches them from behind -- 

				JESSE
		Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.

				EARL
		What?

				JESSE
		Just do it!  Meet me there, now.

Booth and Earl watch Jesse as he makes a beeline for his 
car -- 

INT "TUMBLEWEED" DINER -- DAY

PAN the local diner -- 

Jesse drags on a cigarette and faces Booth and Earl as they sit in a booth -


				JESSE
		There's going to have to be
		a change in our arrangement.

				BOOTH
		What are you proposing?

				JESSE
		I want my share. All of it.

				EARL
		Forget it.

Jesse takes another drag and stares hard at Earl -

				JESSE
		I'm not asking.

				EARL
		Well you're not getting, either.

				JESSE
		Listen -

Jesse looks around the diner -- 

				JESSE
		I don't like getting grilled
		by that DEA bitch, I don't like
		taking that kind of heat!

				BOOTH
		None of us like it!

				JESSE
		Well I don't know what's going 
		to happen next -- she's pressing 
		this, another interrogation, 
		another problem.

				BOOTH
		Just take it in stride.

				JESSE
			(loud)
		I'm not gonna take -- 	
			(beat, quieter)
		I'm not gonna take it in stride.
			(Beat)
		I had a good run turn to shit
		on me like that - 
			(snaps finger hard)
		cleaned me out.

				EARL
		What do you mean?  You gambled it?
				
				JESSE
		I was on a roll!  Iím a little
		overextended now.

				EARL
		Oh Jesus Christ...

				JESSE
		So I want the money and I want it
		now.

				EARL
		Well you can't have it.

Jesse stares at Earl with a mixture of desperation and iron determination -- 

				JESSE
		Look...I can turn that tape over
		to Martin and come out smelling 
		like a rose, you understand that 
		Earl?  So I'm going to make you a 
		final proposition.  I want two 
		million dollars tonight, or the 
		tape goes into her hands tomorrow
		morning.

Booth and Earl stare at Jesse for a beat -- 

				EARL
		You're out of your mind.

				BOOTH
		Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, 
		Jesse.

				JESSE
		You want to see how more unglued I
		can get?  Try me.  

				EARL
		You're never getting that much.
		
				JESSE
		I think I am.	

Jesse gets up -- 

				JESSE
		I'll give you until nine o'clock
		tonight to bring it to my house.
Jesse look at the table -- 

				JESSE
		Hope you don't mind picking up 
		the tab.

Booth and Earl watch Jesse storm off --

A patrol car zooms down the road --

INT PATROL CAR -- DAY

Booth drives and Earl looks out the window -- 

				EARL
		You think he's bluffing?

				BOOTH
		No.

				EARL
		Neither do I.

Earl sighs loudly and looks out the window -- 

				BOOTH
		Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight.  
		This is all messed up...

				EARL
		If you're any friend at all, you'll 
		stop talking like that!

				BOOTH
		Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give 
		him a third in exchange for the tape.

				EARL
		I don't think he's going to be
		doing any bargaining with us, the
		stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides,
		I'm not giving him a third of
		anything, not after everything
		we had to do.

				BOOTH
		Well what are we supposed to do?

				EARL
		I don't know...we have to shut 
		him up somehow.
Booth looks at Earl -- 

				EARL
		Jesse's a reckless guy, Booth.  
		Got a lot of monkeys on his back.
		Who knows, maybe it all catches 
		up with him somehow.

Booth realizes what Earl is saying.

				BOOTH
		You're crazy.

				EARL
		How badly do you want that money?! 
		How bad do you want to stay out of
		jail?

				BOOTH
		Not bad enough to kill him.

				EARL
		Who said anything about killing?
			(beat)
		Just keep driving straight...

EXT BANK -- DAY

Establish the bank, with a patrol car in front -- 

INT BANK -- DAY

Martin, Wallace, and Dwayne are in a room with the bank manager, MR. CURTIS -- 

On a table are three HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS -

				WALLACE 
		Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon.
		The bills arrived at this branch from
		a cash drop.  Came through a store
		called After Midnight.  There's only
		four employees, none of them can tell
		us who passed them.

				DWAYNE
		Is this marked money, or what?

Dwayne looks at Martin and Wallace -- 

				WALLACE
		Some of it.  Denning only handled
		a small portion of the total, but
		it looks like this was one of his 
		bills. 

				DWAYNE
		So there was money there!  Who
		the hell's money is it?!

				MARTIN
		We don't know.  Whoever got this
		payload together has one hell of
		a laundering system.

				DWAYNE
		Have you known this all along?

				MARTIN
		Well you can understand why we
		didn't say anything.  If word
		got out that we had a track on
		the money it would only work 
		against us.

				DWAYNE
		Well yes I understand that, we
		don't want them high-tailing it
		out of here.

Martin then looks at Dwayne -- 

				MARTIN
		Sheriff Hogan -- 

				DWAYNE
		Dwayne.

				MARTIN
			(smiles)
		Dwayne...
			(Beat)
		It is imperative that we keep 
		this confidential.	Now we know 
		someone's out there.  Very close. 
		It may even be the son of a bitch 
		that killed my partner.  

				DWAYNE
		Fine.  The information doesn't leave 
		this room.

Martin looks at the bank manager -

				CURTIS
		I'm not gonna say anything!

				DWAYNE
		Yeah -- this is confidential.

				MARTIN
		OK...this is good.  Our first
		solid lead.

				DWAYNE
		Did you say After Midnight?

				WALLACE
		Yeah.

				DWAYNE
		What the hell is that, some kind
		of porno store or something?

				WALLACE
		Not exactly.  It's some lingerie 
		store on the strip.

				DWAYNE
		Lingerie...

				WALLACE
		Yeah, racy stuff, you know the 
		kind, right?

				DWAYNE
		Sure...

INT HOGAN LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Dwayne and Sally face each other, eating at a table -- 

Nothing is said for a considerable length, Dwayne focused on his plate, Sally 
occasionally looking up at Dwayne -- 

Soon Sally puts her fork down -- 

				SALLY
		All right what's the matter?

Dwayne looks up, then back at his plate -- 

				DWAYNE
		Nothing.  Nothing's the matter.
				SALLY
		Aren't you going to tell how
		your day went?

				DWAYNE
		Not much to tell.  Nothing
		really happened.

				SALLY
		That hasn't stopped you before.

Dwayne looks up at her -- 

				DWAYNE
		Funny...

Dwayne resumes eating -- 

				DWAYNE
		Suppose I'm not exciting enough
		for you.

				SALLY
		I didn't say that.  You did.

				DWAYNE
		Well you might as well say it.
		Mister Small Time...	
		
				SALLY
		Just trying to be civil Dwayne.

Dwayne continues eating -- 

				SALLY
		Don't you want to hear about my
		day?

				DWAYNE
		Yeah let's hear about your day.

				SALLY
		Well I got the tires rotated,
		I went shopping, and I made dinner.

Dwayne doesn't respond -- 

				SALLY
		And a flying saucer landed in the 
		backyard, aliens abducted me, 
		performed experiments, and let me 
		go.


				DWAYNE
		Well it sounds like you had quite
		a full day.

Dwayne keeps looking at his plate -- Sally looks at him   for a beat then gets 
up, taking her plate -- 

				SALLY
		Whatever...

				DWAYNE
		Look I worked all day, I'm tired as
		hell and I want to sit and eat in
		peace!  Is that asking too much?

Sally turns and faces him -- 

				SALLY
		No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax,
		have a six pack and fall asleep in
		front of the TV, and come upstairs
		and pass out.  And do it all over
		again tomorrow!

				DWAYNE
		Save me the sermon.  I've heard it
		all before, it's boring.

				SALLY
		It certainly is...
		
Dwayne watches her leave -- 

EXT JESSE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Booth and Earl approach the door, Booth carrying a bag.  Earl hesitates, pulling a 
pair of latex gloves out of his pocket.  He hands a pair to Booth.
		
				BOOTH
		Perfect.  He'll freak when
		he sees this.

INT JESSE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Jesse takes a swig of booze out of an old glass -- 

The door knocks and Jesse goes to answer it -- he looks through the peephole -- 

POV Booth and Earl are outside.

Jesse smiles and opens the door -- 

				JESSE
		I was beginning to think you
		weren't going to show.
			(looking at bag)
		That can't be all of it.

				BOOTH
		No.  It's not.

Booth and Earl walk in.

				JESSE
		What's...what's with the gloves?

Earl pulls out his service revolver and aims it at Jesse -- 

				EARL
		Sit down, Jesse.

Jesse stares at Booth and Earl in stunned silence -- he laughs, nervously.

				JESSE
		I don't believe this.

Jesse ignores the request, pouring himself another drink.  The bottle shakes slightly. 

				JESSE
		You know, I had a feeling you just
		might pull something like this, 
		some hard-ass tactic.

Jesse takes another swig and looks at them -- 

				JESSE
		Don't you think I'd be prepared?

Earl and Booth stare at Jesse -- 

				EARL
		Sit down, Jesse.

Jesse stares back at them -- 

				JESSE
		You're not going to shoot me.

Earl looks at him, then puts his revolver back -- 

				EARL
		Nah, I guess I can't.

Booth and Earl then GRAB Jesse -- Jesse struggles as they pin him to the ground --

				JESSE
		What the hell are you doing, you 
		crazy some bitches -- 

				EARL
		We're gonna talk.

They drag him up on his feet, over to a METAL OFFICE CHAIR  where they plunk him down -- 
Booth gets out some CUFFS -- 	

				EARL
		I don't suppose you'll tell us
		where the tape is.

				JESSE
		Well it's not here -- you're wasting
		your time and you're pissing me off!

As Earl restrains Jesse, Booth takes one cuff and clamps it around Jesse's wrist and 
the arm of the chair -- Jesse winces in pain -- 

Earl then quickly jams a wooden STICK between Jesseís teeth and ties the ROPE on both 
ends tightly around the back of Jesseís head -

				JESSE
		What the hell!!!

Earl goes over to the bag and pulls out some LAMP CORD which he tosses to Booth - 

Booth takes the cord and quickly begins to secure Jesse to the chair -- 

				JESSE
		I don't know what the hell you're
		doing but you're as good as dead
		now!

Spittle runs down Jesseís chin - 

Earl continues to rummage thought the bag -- he pulls out some OBJECTS wrapped in 
plastic and sets them on a table --  

Jesse watches Earl -- 

				JESSE
		What the hell is this shit!

Earl reaches for Jesse's pack of cigarettes on the table, looks at the brand with disgust, 
hrows them on the table -- he fumbles in his pockets and finds one MENTHOL cigarette left in a soft pack in his shirt pocket --  he hastily stuffs the pack halfway in his pocket -

				EARL
		You're the only person I know on
		Earth who smokes this bullshit
		brand!

Jesse looks on as Earl lights up the cigarette and begins to open the plastic package,  
revealing first a SPOON, which he places on the table, then a SYRINGE  - and then a small 
white plastic bottle, labeled POTASSIUM - 

A look of genuine concern crosses Jesseís face as he sees the bottle - 

				JESSE
		If anything happens to me I got 
		people who'll go straight -- 
			(struggling)
		straight to a safety deposit box 
		and they'll find out everything!

Booth continues to tie up Jesse as he and Earl look at each other -- 

				BOOTH
		You don't expect us to believe
		that do you?

				JESSE
		You better believe it if
		you know what's good for you!
				
				EARL
		See that's the problem with you.
		You got a big mouth.  A big fat
		mouth.

Earl takes a spoonful of potassium and holds a LIGHTER over it - the heat causes a 
lavender smoke to rise as the potassium liquefies -

				JESSE
		Get me out of this!  Get me out
		of this asshole!!  You try
		anything, you'll leave a thousand
		clues.  We find 'em all the time.  
		We're trained for it.


				EARL
		So are we, Jesse.
		
Jesse begins to struggle wildly, kicking fiercely -- Booth fights to stabilize him -- 

				EARL
		Dammit settle him down!

Booth fights to do so -- he stares at Earl -- 

Earl fills the syringe, hands beginning to shake as he liquid fills the chamber -

				BOOTH
		How long is it going to take?!

				EARL
		I don't know!  Shit, give me a 
		break!
			 
CRASH!!!! Jesse and the chair hit the ground.  His face is smashed against the floor.

				JESSE
		Come on, Booth.  Don't let him 
		do this!!!

				BOOTH
		Don't have much choice, Jesse.
		You saw to that!

				JESSE
		You're only screwing yourselves
		over!
			(Beat)
		Helllllp!
			(louder)
		HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!

				BOOTH
		Shut up, Jesse.

				JESSE
			(at the top of
			his lungs)
		HELLLLLP!!!!

				EARL
		No one's gonna hear you, Jesse.  
		We're in the middle of nowhere!

Earl approaches with the menacing needle --

				EARL
		Look, get him up, all right?

Booth struggles and fails to pull Jesse up -- Earl puts down the syringe and together 
they stand Jesse upright -- 

Jesse is almost in tears now, blood seeps from a cut on his cheek.

				JESSE
		Don't hurt me.

				EARL
		We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough,
		but you didn't leave us any
		choice.  We gotta know where
		the tapes are.

Earl brings the needle over...he begins to bring it toward the direction of Jesseís mouth -

Jesse is coming unglued - Earl stares at him hard - 

				EARL
		Easy to purchase, hard to detect.
		Too much potassium can kill a man.
			(Beat)
		Just have to...pick a discreet spot.

				JESSE
		Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the 
		money.  You can have it all.

				BOOTH
		Where's the tape?  Where are the
		copies?

Jesse looks down as the needle enters his mouth, just under the tongue - his eyes bulge in fear - 

				JESSE
		THERE AREN'T ANY COPIES!  THERE'S
		JUST THE ORIGINAL, AND I'LL TAKE
		YOU THERE!!!  

				JESSE
		I'm not convinced...

Earl then STABS the needle under Jesseís tongue - Jesse SCREAMS as Booth watches with great 
apprehension -

 				BOOTH
		Whoa, Earl!

				JESSE	
		OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED
		TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!

				BOOTH	
		What are you doing, Earl?

Earl looks at Jesse, then back at Booth - he then removes the needle from Jesse's mouth -  

Suddenly, Booth slams Earl against the wall - Earl's cigarette pack goes flying --

				BOOTH
		What are you thinking?
			(under his breath)
		We were only supposed to scare
		him!

				EARL
		I'm just making our intentions 
		clear. Go check the desk.

				JESSE
		See, I'm telling the truth!

Booth pulls the cassette from the bottom, held there by masking tape.

				BOOTH
		Here it is.

				EARL
		There it is...now what about
		the others?

				JESSE
		There are no others, Goddammit!		

Earl turns and smiles at Jesse - 

				EARL
		Better safe than sorry.

Earl then rapidly and unexpectedly STABS the needle under Jesseís tongue and INJECTS the 
contents - 

Jesse screams, then after a second - he JOLTS VIOLENTLY - his eyes roll back into his head - 

				BOOTH
		Earl!!! 

Booth pulls Earl away, but it's too late.  The syringe is empty - 

Jesse JOLTS violently again, and CRASHES to the floor - 

The two men stare at Jesse in shocked silence - 

Jesse exhales one final time, a death gasp from his open, drooling mouth -  

Booth looks at Earl with a mixture of shock and terror - 

				EARL
		We had no choice.

Booth says nothing - 

				EARL
		You know that.  Deep down, you 
		know it.  

Booth then turns and looks at Jesse - 

				EARL
		Even if we have the tape, that 
		wouldn't shut him up!

				BOOTH
		You killed him...

				EARL
			(Beat)
		It's gonna be o.k.

				BOOTH
		Like hell it is.  This is Jesse!
		Jesse!

Jesse's eyes dilate.  His head rocks back.

				EARL
		You know there's no other way.

Earl stands back.  Booth backs away in horror, sweat running down his face - 

				BOOTH
		What's going on?  What's
		happening to us??

Booth runs his hand through his hair, turns to the window again, disgusted by what's happening -- 


				BOOTH
		You...stupid....

Booth then turns and SHOVES Earl violently across the room -

				BOOTH
		Son of a bitch!

Booth looks around and heads out the front door -- 

Earl gets up and follows him - 

EXT DWAYNE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
		
Booth steps out to the porch, feeling his chest as if sickened -- Earl follows him out and 
GRABS HIM, spins him around - 

				EARL
		Wait a minute!

Booth shoves him back, and the two men square off - 

				EARL
		Don't start losing it on me Booth!  
		Do you understand what I'm saying!

Booth stares at Earl for a beat - 

				BOOTH
		Jesus Christ Earl...what are we
		doing?...

				EARL
		We're doing what we gotta do, to
		protect ourselves!  

				BOOTH	
		You don't know if he was really 
		gonna --

			     EARL
		Yes I DO!  It never woulda
		stopped, you know that.  Jesse's
		always gonna be making mistakes
		and we'd be paying for them
		for the rest of our lives.

Earl grabs Booth --
				EARL
		Now you have to get it under control.
		We gotta get out of here, we gotta 
		set him up just right and you
		can't come apart on me now!
Booth takes a very deep breath -- 

				EARL
		Now are you under control?

Booth looks at Earl, fighting to maintain composure --

									DISSOLVE TO
INT JESSE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Jesse's lifeless eyes stare into the camera, his mouth agape, his head lying in a pool of 
saliva -- the camera stays with him for a long moment, pulling back slowly -- all that 
can be heard is the ticking of a CLOCK- 

Booth and Earl look down at the body saying nothing -- the camera stays with them for a 
long moment -- 

We see all three men, motionless, Booth and Earl standing over Jesse -- 

CLOSE ON JESSE'S MOUTH as Booth removes the gag - 

Together, Earl and Booth carefully remove the handcuffs and lamp cord -- 

Earl stands the chair up -- 

Booth and Earl look down at Jesse -- 

Earl takes Jesse's hand and pulls it out above him -- 

He grabs the whiskey glass and places it near Jesse's hand, spilling the contents on the 
ground -- 

Booth scoops up the items on the table --  

Booth turns the TV on with the sound off -- Earl watches this but doesn't protest -- 

Booth stuffs the lamp cord back into the bag -- 

Earl and Booth look at Jesse -- 

Jesse lies on the ground, appearing to have collapsed on his own -- 

Earl and Booth look at him.  They look guilty as hell. 

				BOOTH
		Maybe we should say somethin'.

				EARL
		Come on.
Booth grabs the bag -- 

				EARL
		Do you have everything?

				BOOTH
		I sure as hell hope so.
			(Beat)
		Let's go.

Booth and earl do a final check of the room -- 

Booth opens the front door and turns the inside lock -- 

Together the men take one last look, then exit -

The door closes -

CAMERA PANS over, down, across the floor, and settling onto something under a radiator -- 

It is Earl's empty cigarette pack --

		Hi.

Dwayne plays it casual, looking at the assortment of bras, panties, teddys, garter belts, 
sheer bathrobes, etc., etc...

The salesperson approaches -- 

				SALESPERSON
		Anything I can help you with?

		I have an anniversary coming up,
		thought I'd buy her something 
		special.

				SALESPERSON
		Anything...specific?

				DWAYNE
		Well I don't know...

Dwayne laughs nervously, gesturing to a garment that leaves little to the imagination -- 

				DWAYNE
		I mean, how much is something
		like that?

The salesperson checks -- 

				SALESPERSON
		This is...65 dollars.


				DWAYNE

		Jeez Louise!

				SALESPERSON
		We are having a sale on some items

				SALESPERSON
		Do you know her sizes?

The question catches Dwayne off guard -

		Uh, well I don't know her specific

The salesperson patiently smiles -- 

Dwayne pulls out his wallet -- 

				DWAYNE
		Maybe I can give you an idea...

He produces a PHOTOGRAPH of Sally -- hands it to the salesperson -- 

				SALESPERSON

		Yeah, she is.  She comes up

		Hmmm...

		Shopping here?

				SALESPERSON
		No, I can't say that I have.

				DWAYNE
		Oh.

Dwayne puts the photo back -- the salesperson looks at the rack -

				DWAYNE
		No I don't.  
			(Beat)
		You sure you havenít seen her?

The salesperson smiles and shakes her head politely, taken aback by his curiosity - 

				DWAYNE
		Well...I should have done a 
		little homework, getting all 
		the sizes, and what not.

				SALESPERSON
		Sure.

				DWAYNE
		I'm just not very good...with all 
		of this stuff.

		Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel
		uncomfortable when they come in

		A lot of men come in here?

				SALESPERSON
		Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we

		What did he buy?

				CLERK
		I don't remember.  We get a

		Could it have been this?

She hands over a 3-pack of Maxell cassette tapes.

		When was the last time he was

		Not too long ago.

		Be more specific.  A month, a week...

		A week ago, at most.  

				MARTIN
		Thanks for your time.

WHAM!!! Wallace kicks the door open and he and Martin rush in.

They freeze when they see Jesse on the ground.

				WALLACE
		Oh shit...

Jesse stares blankly through glazed eyes -- 

Martin goes over to the body and checks Jesse's wrist -- 


				WALLACE
		Is he dead?

Martin feels Jesse's neck for a pulse and realizes it's futile -- 

				MARTIN
		Yeah.

				WALLACE
		What do you think?  Heart attack?

Martin inspects the ABRASIONS on Jesse's wrist -- then looks around the room -- 

				MARTIN
		I don't know...  

Martin looks for the phone -- 

				MARTIN
		Get Sheriff Hogan down here,

		This isn't right...

		I'm not getting an answer.

				MARTIN
		Not getting an answer?  For 
		Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's
		get it locked down here!	

Wallace hangs up and dials 911 -- 

Martin crouches down and inspects the wound on Jesse's forehead -- she shakes her 
head and sighs, frustrated -- 

Something then catches her eye in the corner -- 

She gets up, walks over to it, crouches down, and picks it up.

It is Earl's empty cigarette pack.

		Wallace?  Get over here.

		never thought you'd do this to me
		but I guess there's a lot I
		didn't know about you!

				BOOTH
		Dwayne listen to me -

				DWAYNE
		Shut up!  Not another word out of
		you!  You're going down, the Feds
		know all about it!  You didn't know
		some of it was marked, did you!  
		Where's the rest?

				BOOTH
		I don't know what you're -

				DWAYNE
			(enraged)
		Don't lie to me!!!!

				SALLY
		Dwayne please calm down!

				DWAYNE
		Calm down -- 

BLAM BLAM!!!  Booth and Sally cringe as Dwayne fires around the room.

				DWAYNE
		How's that??!   How's that for 
		calm??!

CLOSE ON THE MUZZLE OF A GUN

-- as it goes off.  BLAM!



INT EARL'S CAR -- DAY

The back window BLOWS OUT.  BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Wallace's other bullets go wild.

INT JESSE'S CAR -- DAY

Wallace fights for aim, using his left hand.  

BLAMM BLAMM! --

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

BLAM!  Dwayne fires again --

				DWAYNE
		How's that, you -- 

POW!  Dwayne punches Sally across the face -- 

Booth SPRINGS on Dwayne -- the men CRASH around the room -- 

Booth STRUGGLES for the gun -- 

WHAM!  WHAM! Booth cracks Dwayne's hand against the dresser but he refuses to let go of the gun -- 

Sally stumbles to her feet, heads toward the men -- 

				SALLY
		Stop!   Stop!!!

The two men whirl around -

Dwayne FIRES -- 

BLAM!!! 

The bullet RIPS into Sally's chest and she slams into the wall -- 

Booth SMASHES Dwayne's arm against the wall -- he drops the gun and it 
rattles across the ground into the living room --

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Booth and Dwayne begin to fight ferociously, fists flying -- they SCRAMBLE 
for the gun.  It goes skittering down further across the floor --

Dwayne POUNDS Booth in the face, SLAMMING him back into the bedroom area of 
the trailer -- Dwayne heads for the gun --


INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

Booth shakes it off, is about to follow, when he looks toward  the nightstand.  
Opens it.  His revolver is there --

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Dwayne REACHES for the gun, checks the load.  He stands up, satisfied, brings 
it around, and -- 

BLAM!  A bullet RIPS through Dwayne's forehead -- 

He falls back and his head hits the ground -- Booth holds the smoking gun --

INT. EARL'S CAR -- DAY

Earl reaches across the seat, for the glove compartment.  Opens it.  No weapons.

BLAM! A bullet whizzes through the headrest where Earl's head would have been.

He comes back up, but only then sees the turnoff for Booth's trailer.  Too late.  

He whips the wheel around, and --

-- Earl loses control of the car.

EXT ROADWAY -- DAY

Earl skids, braking sharply into the dust at the side of the road.  A billowing 
cloud of dust follows behind him.

INT JESSE'S CAR -- DAY

Wallace follows close behind, into the cloud, when --

WALLACE'S POV of Earl's car DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM!

Wallace JERKS the wheel around in the nick of time, skittering, SPARKING along 
the side of Earl's car --

EXT HIGHWAY -- DAY

 -- and INTO THE AIR, off the embankment at the side of the road.

Wallace is AIRBORNE, plummeting down, hood first, into the small gorge.

His car EXPLODES in a HUGE BALL OF FLAME.

INT EARL'S CAR -- DAY

Earl sees this, grimaces, and puts the car back into gear, turning off the road 
toward Booth's trailer.

The dust rises behind him as he drives up toward Booth, and the money.

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

Booth staggers into the room, dropping the gun, horrified by the scene -- he 
moves over to Sally -- 

				BOOTH
		Sally!  Oh my God, oh my God -- 

Sally wheezes, in the throes of death, bleeding profusely -- Booth cradles 
her firmly -- 

				BOOTH
		Don't die on me, don't die on
		me, don't die on me -- 

She tries to speak, but can't.  She's gone.

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Earl opens the door -- 

Dwayne stares up at him, his head resting in a pool of 
blood.

Earl bites his lip.

He sees Dwayne's gun on the floor, then hears Booth's cries of anguish.

He heads toward the bedroom, toward the sound.

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

Booth cradles Sally, whose shirt is soaked in blood --  

				EARL
		Oh Jesus...
			
				BOOTH
			(inconsolable)
		He killed her...he killed her...

				EARL
		What happened?  What's Earl doing 
		here?

				BOOTH
		He found us, he shot her...he
		killed her...

				EARL
		Booth, listen to me...Booth!

				BOOTH
		He killed her...

Earl goes over to Booth -


				EARL
		We got to get out of here.  Do
		you understand?  We got to get 
		out of here right now!

				BOOTH
		No.  It stops now.  It stops here.

				EARL
		What do you mean?
			(beat)
		Look.  We can make still make
		it work.  

Earl pauses, his mind racing.

				BOOTH
		Dwayne's dead.

				EARL
		I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, 
		but we can deal with it.  
			(thinking)
		We'll pin it on him.  
			(thinking faster)
		The DEA was driving Jesse's car.  
		No car phone.  No radio.  They 
		couldn't have called me in.

He picks up Booth's gun with a finger.  Holds it out to Booth.

				EARL
		It'll look like Dwayne killed them, 
		then came to kill you, too.  Self - 
		defense.  Sally just got caught up 
		in it.

Booth refuses to take the gun. Earl drops it to the floor instead.

				BOOTH
		What are you talking about?

				EARL
		Dwayne had the opportunity, just 
		like us.  He was at the scene.  He 
		grabbed the cash.  Of course.
			(excited)
		This is perfect!

Booth suddenly stands, grabbing Earl's shoulders.

				BOOTH
		Are you nuts?  Sally's dead!
		Dwayne's dead.  Jesse's dead!
		There's no walking away from this!
		It is OVER!  Do you hear me?

Earl isn't fazed.

				EARL
		We'll need the money.

And with that, Earl is out of the door, headed down the hallway.  

Booth waits a beat, looks down to the floor, grabs up his gun. 

He follows Earl.

INT TRAILER LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Earl grabs the shovel on the way, looks up at the burial site on the hill 
above.  Booth is right behind.

POV of the burial site, from down below.

				BOOTH
		It's too late...

				EARL
		It's NOT too late!

				BOOTH
		Yes it is.  I'm calling it 
		in.  Right now.

Booth picks up the phone with his free hand.  This stops Earl.  He turns around.  

Booth is pointing the gun at him.


				BOOTH
		We've been making the wrong moves
		all along. It's time to make the 
		right one.

Earl replies, gesturing out the window, toward the hill where the money lies.

				EARL
		You're the one who's nuts!
		There's no one left to touch us,
		Booth.  We're home free!  We just
		plant a little of the money on
		Dwayne, and it's all ours.

				BOOTH
		It's not about the money anymore.
		Can't you see that?  It's about

		the lies.  The lies, Earl. 

				EARL
		Just one more.  This one knocks off
		all the rest.

				BOOTH
		I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't
		keep lying...killing.  That's
		not me.  That's not US.

Booth stands his ground.

				EARL
		You gonna shoot me, partner?  Is
		that what you're gonna do?

Booth considers for a moment.  Drops his gun to his side, then tosses it 
onto the couch.

				BOOTH
		No.  
			(beat)
		No, I'm not.  The killing stops 
		here.

Earl turns to look up the hill, as Booth continues.

				BOOTH
		You do what you gotta do, 
		Earl.  You take it all if you
		want.  But I'm going in.

Earl turns to look at his partner for a long beat.  

He turns his head again.  Looks up the hill, to where the money lies.  

				EARL
		That'll bring me down, too.
		Eventually.  You gotta know
		that.

				BOOTH
		Uh huh.  

				EARL
		And you're solid on that?

				BOOTH
		Rock solid.

Then Earl picks up Dwayne's gun in one quick motion, and points it at Booth.

Booth doesn't flinch.

Booth looks Earl straight in the eye.  Almost nods.

Earl can't do it.  He looks at his partner, grits his teeth.  He begins to put 
the gun down, then --

BLAM!!!  

A bullet BLASTS through Booth's chest -- he flies back -- BLAM!!! Another one 
sends him to the ground -- 

BLAM!!! Earl finishes Booth off with a shot to the head -- 

Earl wipes off the gun, almost crying now.

He places it in Dwayne's hand -- 

Earl surveys the carnage around the room for a beat.  Hangs his head.
 
EXT TRAILER HOME -- DAY

Earl trudges up the hill, toward the money.

EXT HIGHWAY -- DAY

A highway patrol car is next to the smoking wreck of Jesse's car.  The officer 
looks down on the scene.

Martin approaches in her car.  She runs over, flashing her i.d.


				MARTIN
		Is he alive?

				OFFICER
		No, ma'am.

She looks down to the tire tracks, which pull off the road and up toward 
Booth's trailer.

				MARTIN
		Officer, follow me.

EXT BURIAL SITE -- DAY

Earl begins to dig -

EXT DIRT ROAD -- DAY

Martin's car heads up the road, the highway patrol car right behind.

EXT BURIAL SITE -- DAY

Earl digs frantically -- 

Something is wrong.  He sees the cloud of dust down below, and the cars 
approaching. 

He digs faster.

EXT TRAILER HOME -- DAY

Martin's car stops, parks next to Earl's.  

She is about to head inside, when she looks up the hill, to where a lone 
figure is standing, bent over.				

				MARTIN
		Stay here, with your gun trained 
		on that door, until backup arrives.

And she heads up the hill.

EXT BURIAL SITE -- DAY

Earl is looking into the hole, puzzled.

He reaches into the hole, pulls something out.

EXT HILLSIDE -- DAY

Martin pulls out her weapon, cautious --

Suddenly -
BLAM!!! A single shot pierces the air -- 

Martin looks around, down at the officer, then back up at the burial site.

EXT BURIAL SITE -- DAY

Earl falls to the ground, a single bullet wound in his forehead.  A smoking 
gun rests in one hand, a note rests in the other.  In a few seconds, Martin 
runs up to the site -- 

The note blows out of Earl's hand -- 

Martin inspects the scene, bewildered -- 

As she picks up the note, the camera begins a long PULL-BACK and CLIMB.

We MOVE up, over the scene, higher still, past the cars, high above the 
desert floor, PANNING as we hear Booth's voice. 

				BOOTH (V.O.)
I know you're gonna kill me for this, partner, 
but your debts are pretty big, and this money is a real temptation. 
 It's not that I don't trust you.  I just know how tough things have 
 been for you recently, and I'll keep helping out all I can. I buried 
 the money somewheres else, and as soon as this blows over, you and 
 I will go dig it up together.  Hope you aren't too mad. You're 
 my partner, come hell or high water, and I'm only doing this 
 for the both of us.  

FADE OUT.

THE END
