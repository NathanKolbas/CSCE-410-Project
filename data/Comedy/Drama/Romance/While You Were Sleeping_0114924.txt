WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING...

by
Dan Sullivan and Fred Lebow
EXT. QUEERS ~ LATE FALL ~ 1974

A subway car rattles beneath a cobalt sky. It’s a cold November
evening. ‘Tarked amid a rdw of storefronts is Moderatz and Hinch
Insurance fo. The door opens, a belli jingles and a little giri
and a man wearing a heavy gray overcoat step out. The man locks
the store, telds the little girl’s hand and they walk down the
street together. A woman’s voice comes up in VOICE OVER.

v.07
My father was a lier.
(beat)

I guess that’s kind of strong.
He was in sales. His motto

was never leave the prospects’
house until they call the cops.

cur TO:

EXT. WOODSIDE RAILYARD

Trains pull in and out of the yard. Heavily bundled workmen
trudge up and down the tracks. The man and the little girl stand
off to the side. The father points to the wheezing passenger
trains. The little girl looks up at him, fascinated.

v.O.
He would tell me stories. Some~-
times they were about all the
places we were going to visit.
Exotic places like Fiji, xuvala
Lumpur, even Paraguay. The
Poconos weren’t good enough
for us.
af
The little girl and the man walk along the railroad tracks.

vV.0.
But mostly the stories he told me
were about my mother. He said
they met at the World’s Fair in
1964. He broke the bell with one
ef these mallets you swing and they
gave him his choice of stuffed bears.
He saw my Mom in the crowd but he
didn’t give her the bear. He gave
it to a little girl. He told ny
Mom he’d get her a real bear if one
was ignorant enough to cross his path.
They spent a magical day together.
When the sun set she gave him her
phone number and told him if
he didn’t call her the next morning
she would know he didn’t truly love
her. He put the number in his wallet
and on the train ride home...
V.0O.

(CONT'D)
«ea pickpocket stole his wallet.

(beat)
Well, he said, a lesser man who
wasn’t so in love would have de~
sSpaired but not him. He remember-
ed she was a school teacher so the
next morning he started at P.Ss. 1
and searched every school in New

York City until he found her.
cur TO:

INT. BEDROGS ~- NIGHT

The little girl sleeps. The man tucks her in gently and turns on
her nightlight. He stands in the glow of the nightlight and
watches his daughter sleep.

V.0.
I asked my father once how I would
know when I was in love and he
told me, "The day I met your mother,
I heard Strangers in the Night."
CUT TO:

INT. SUBWAY STATION - BROOKLYN ~ DECEMBER ~ 1994

CLOSEUP ON LUCY MODERATZ. Lucy, 25, wears glasses and a thick
wool MTA jacket. She sits in her tokenzbooth and peers out.

v.02
Well, I didn't hear Strangers
in the Night but,;when I saw hin
I knew he was the one...

Lucy’s P.0.V. A breathtakingly handsome man strides confidently
down the subway stairs. He wears a cashmere topcoat over a
pinstriped Armani suit and carries himself and his briefcase with
panache. He has strong chiseled features, a square jaw and eyes
Paul Newman would envy.

v.0.
He started coming to my subway
booth in September. Monday
through Friday between 8:00 and
8:20. One Monday he didn’t show
up and I started to panic.
Luckily it was Columbus Day
and he was back again on Tues-
day morning.

He approaches the token booth, and slides §1.25 through the slot.
Lucy smiles broadly and slides him a token. He scoops it up,
never looks at her and pushes through the turnstile.
v.07
I hadn’t actually spoken to
him but I knew someday I would...

He boards the train. The doors BING BONG closed. The train pulls
out of the station and into the tunnel. He stands in the window.

v.02
He was perfect.

The VOICE GVER ENDS as the train disappears into the tunnel.

CUT TO:
EXT. BROOKLYH - NIGHT

Snow falls lightly over the city. Christmas decorations are
strung along Prospect Park. The North star winks above the vast
span of the Manhattan Bridge. A Christmas tree stands on the
sidewalk. Suddenly, as if by magic, it rises slowly in the air.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

Lucy, the token booth attendant, plants her feet, grips the rope
tied to the Christmas tree and pulls. The tree lurches upward.

LUCY
(complains)
45 dollars for a Christmas tree
and they won't deliver. You
order $10 worth of chow mein
from Twin Dragons and the
bring it to your door.

Lucy pulis. Her cat, MEL, watches curiously.
The Christmas tree sways as it climbs into the air.
Lucy
(to Mel)
I should have got the blue
spruce, they’re lighter.

Lucy huffs and puffs as she hauls on the rope. The tree creeps
closer to the fire escape. Suddenly Mel leaps into the air.

LUCY
Mel}

The cat springs onto the Christmas tree. The tree swings wildly
back and forth. Lucy struggles to hold the rope.

LUCY
Don’t look down!

Mel clings to the tree. Lucy tries to lower the rope.
LUCY
Hold on!

The tree swings -~ CRASH! A window shatters. A voice bellows
from belaw!

VOICE (o.s.)
Lucy!

INT. APHRIMENT = LATER

Lucy neryously stands in her landlord, MR. MOLLO’S apartment.
So does Mel, who stands safely behind her. Plastic covers the
broken window. Mr. Mollo sits at a table with a claim forn.

MR. MOLLO
(reads)
Nature of claim...Christmas tree
through window.
(looks at Lucy)
How’m I gonna write that on
my insurance?

Lucy casts her eyes down.
MR. MOLLO

They’re still pissed off about
that arson claim I made in Staten

Island.
LUCY =
I'll pay for it, Mr. Mollo.
MR. MOLLO
Why didn’t you bring it up the
stairs? .
LUCY

I couldn’t carry it myself and
you don’t like pine needles
in the halliway...I’m sorry, Mr.

Mollo.
MR. MOLLO
That’s 0.K., Lucy.
(stands)

My brother Funzie’s in the
glass business.

Lucy heads for the door.

Lucy
I almost forgot.

Lucy slips a tiny present out of her pocket.
LUCY
Merry Christmas.

MR. MOLLO
(surprised)
Lucy, you didn’t have to do
that.

Lucy
I wanted to.

MR. MOLLO
(embarrassed)
I haven't gotten to my shopping
yet.
(beat)
What size shoe you wear?

JOE MOLLO JR. walks in. Joe Jr. is 22 and has his shirt
provocatively unbuttoned to his pot belly. A gold chain with a
Playboy bunny decal hangs around the folds in his neck.

JOE OR.
Hey, Pop, can I give that bottle
of Blue Nun you got from cousin
Ornella to my probation officer?

MR. MOLLO
Joe Jr., can’t you see I’m
talking here? me

Lucy opens the door.

MR. MOLLO
You're a nice girl, Lucy.
(whispers)
You know Joe dr. is still
single.

Lucy looks at Joe Jr. He bends over and looks in the
refrigerator.

Lucy
(uncomfortable)
Yes, well, that’s a shocker.

Joe Jr. perks up. He strikes a pose.
MR. MOLLO
Just thinking out loud.
Night, Lucy.

Lucy smiles and the door closes. The hall is empty. Lucy picks
up her cat and walks down the dingy hallway.
Lucy
(scolds)
Next time you get me set up
with Joe Jr. I’m getting a dog.
CUT TO:
INT. LUCY*"S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT

Lucy looks through her mail. One Christmas card. She opens it.
It’s stamped, "Happy Holidays from YOUR LETTER CARRIER." Lucy
‘places it carefully on her bookcase next to Christmas cards from
the SANITATION MAN, the PHONE COMPANY and KEY FOOD. She finds a
Christmas mecord and puts it on the stereo, she opens a box of
Christmas tree ornaments and starts decorating her battered tree.

EXT, LUCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

LONG SHOT. Lucy is in the window draping tinsel on her Christmas
tree -- alae.

cuT TO:
INT. CHOC-¥0LL-OF-NUTS - DAY

A waitress weaves through the busy restaurant and sweeps past
Lucy. Lucy sits at a small table. She opens her pocketbook and
pulls out a stack of travel brochures. The colorful pamphlets
advertise everything from castles in Europe to sandy beaches in
the Caribbean. She spreads them carefully on the table.

WAITRESS
Ready to order?
Lucy ~
(smiles)
I’ll have the usual.
WAITRESS
What’s that?
LUCY
(embarrassed)

Tuna sandwich on whole wheat.

The waitress scribbles on a pad and moves off. There’s a rap on
the window. Lucy looks up.

Her supervisor, JERRY WALLACE, a black man also wearing an MTA
jacket, waves. Lucy quickly scoops up her travel brochures and
tucks them in her pocketbook. Jerry walks in, blows some warmth
into his hands and joins her.

JERRY
I was hoping I’d find you here.

Lucy
I was hoping you'd find me
in Bermuda.
Jerry leans forward.

JERRY
I’m recot.hending you for the
MTA employee of the month award.

Lucy
(smiles)
Really, I didn’t know there was
an employee of the month award.

The waitress comes over.
JERRY
(to waitress)
The usual,

The waitress nods and moves off. Lucy frowns.

Jerry pulls a

sheet of paper from his pocket. He slips on a pair of glasses.

JERRY
(reads)

Supervisor Jerry Wallace nominates
Lucy Moderatz for MTA employee of

the month. Lucy is never tardy

and always works holidays, even if
she has worked the previous holiday.
Just because she worked Thanksgiving
Lucy is willing to work Christmas too.

Lucy
I’m not working Christmas.

JERRY ,'
They give you a nice plaque with
the mayor’s stamp on it.

Lucy
I didn’t vote.

JERRY
You get holiday pay.

Lucy isn’t impressed.
JERRY
(cheerfully)
You can have your birthday off.

Lucy
My birthday’s Christmas.

Jerry folds his nomination and slides it back in his pocket.
JERRY

(sincerely)
Listen, I know you worked Thanks-
giving. But Arlette got invited
to her mother’s in Buffalo.
Celeste can’t switch because she’s
having a big family thing and I
promised the kids I’d be home for
‘em this year.

LUCY
This stinks, Jerry.

JERRY
(sympathetically)
I know it isn’t fair and I
can’t make you do it.
(softly) .
But you’re the only one...

Jerry stops. He looks embarrassed.

Lucy
Without family.
cur TO:

INT. SUBWAY ~- JAY STREET/BOROUGH HALL ~ CHRISTMAS DAY

Lucy stands in the token booth carefully adjusting a tiny wreath.
A portable radio plays Christmas songs.— Lucy sits and stares
out at the empty station.

An F train clatters into the station. The doors open. A young
couple steps off laughing and carrying Christmas presents.

A family walks out of another car and pushes through the swinging
exit doors. The children follow the parents like baby ducks.

Lucy sits forlornly in the booth. Andy Williams’ "I’1l Be Hone
for Christmas" comes on the radio. Lucy's lower lip quivers and
her eyes start to fill. She takes off her glasses and brushes
away a tear.

$1.25 slides through her slot.
Lucy reflexively slides out a token.
MAN'S VOICE
(o.s., Pleasantly)
Merry Christmas.
Lucy looks up. Mr. Perfect in the cashmere coat stands on the

other side of the glass. He smiles. The entire station seems to
light up. Lucy is stunned. She opens her mouth to answer.
Lucy
Arrrgk.

Cashmere sevops his token, and in an instant -- he’s gone. Lucy
is frozen. A crooked smile is stamped on her face. She sits inh
Silence. The radio seems to fade out. There’s an eerie quiet.

Lucy
{calmly)
Four months. Four months I
waited for this moment.
(her voice rises)
Never took a sick day.

She stands and looks through her bubble. He‘s disappeared.

Lucy
I could have said...
(smiles)
"Merry Christmas to you."
(angrily)
But I said...
(shouts)
“Arrgk!"
(bangs her head
against the glass)
Idiot! Stupid, stupid, idiot!

Suddenly she hears a yell! She looks through the glass.

Lucy’S P.O.V. -- Far down the platform Cashmere is being mugged.
Two men grapple with hin.

Lucy grabs the phone. a

Cashmere lurches backward and falls headfirst off the platforn.

Lucy
Oh, my God!

Lucy bursts out of her booth. She vaults the turnstile and races
along the platforn.

Cashmere lies face down on the tracks.
A train’s lights appear in the tunnel!
Lucy
{runs faster)
A train’s coming! Get off
the tracks!

He doesn’t move. Lucy skids to a stop--gets on her hands and
knees. The train HORN blasts!
io

LUCY
(enunciates)
Can=~you--hear me?! A--train--
is coming!

The man locks up groggily, sees Iucy and passes out.

LUCY
Help!

The train streaks toward him!
Lucy dangles over the edge of the tracks and extends her hand.

LUCY
Grab my hand!

He doesn’t move. Lucy...stretches! The train’s HORN blares!

Lucy looks at the on-rushing train -- looks at the helpless
figure -- shuts her eyes and jumps.

She tumbles next to the unconscious man, scrambles to her feet
and tries to lift him. His coat is caught.

The train bears down...
Lucy pulls -- the coat tears...

The train sweeps past the CAMERA. The dast car disappears into
the tunnel. SILENCE.

Lucy’s head pops up. She has pressed herseif and the man into
the notch workmen use to let trains pass. She looks down. He’s
unconscious but even more breathtaking. Lucy stares at hin.
She's in love.

cuT To:
INT. EMERGENCY ROOM

BOOM! Paramedics sweep through the emergency room pushing a
gurney with the subway victim strapped to it. Lucy scampers
behind them. It’s Christmas day in New York. Chaos. Gun shot
wounds, car accident victims and attempted suicides crowd the
halis. A nurse, WANDA COLES, holds a clipboard and meets then.

WANDA
Head injury, this way.

The paramedics bang through a swinging door. A self-important,
young INTERN stops Lucy.

INTERN
You can’t come in here.
ai

Lucy
But I have to. I have to see
if he’s O.K.

INTERN
You family?

Lucy
No.

INTERN

Staff and family members only.
The gurney is shoved into an elevator.

Lucy
(frustrated)
You don’t understand, I jumped
in front of a train.

The intern stands fast. The elevator closes.

Lucy
Get out of my way!

Lucy shoves past the startled intern. Wanda intervenes.

WANDA
(sympathetically)
Come with me. =

As Lucy follows Wanda we CUT To:

She picks up the phone. .

They storm the front desk.

The nurse quickly looks through a file. She finds Conlon.

The elevator BINGS opens. The family storms out.
CUT TO:

INT. INTENSIVE CARE

The subway victim lies on a bed. Monitors blink and beep. Tubes
are hooked to his arms and nose. He’s still unconscious.

WANDA
(whispers)
I can only give you a minute.

Lucy nods. She edges forward. The unconscious man looks serene.
The room is quiet. Lucy slowly reaches out..

VOICE (0.5.)
Who are you?

Lucy jumps. A doctor enters brusquely and walks to the side of
the bed.
14

WANDA
(quickly)
That’s his...fiance, doctor.

Lucy looks at Wanda.

DOCTOR
(sympathetically)
I’m sorry but we don’t allow
visitors at this hour.

Lucy
Will he be 0.K.?

DOCTOR
(somberly)
He’s stabilized. Nurse.

The doctor motions with his eyes for the door. Wanda leads Lucy
toward the door.

OX (o.s.)
DON’T TELL ME ABOUT PASSES!
WHERE THE HELL IS HE!

Wanda, Lucy and the doctor look at each other. Lucy reaches for
the door. Suddenly a hurricane seems to blow into the room. The
door flies open and the Conlons tumble in.

Ox spots his unconscious son, PETER, tha-subway victim, lying in
the hospital bed. Midge rushes past Ox as they crowd around the
bed. Elsie clutches rosary beads. Midge grabs Peter’s hand. Ox
stands helplessly behind his wife.

"

DOocTOR
(angry)

What is this?!

ox
This is my son! How is he?

DOCTOR
You can’t come bursting into

MIDGE

He’s going to be all right?

The doctor doesn’t answer.
ox

going on?
15

The doctor looks uncomfortable. The family looks at hin,
The doctor answers reluctantly.

DOCTOR
He’s in a coma.

MIDGE
(stricken)
Dear God. on Christmas day.

Elsie fights back a sob. Saul grabs a chair for support. ox
looks like he’s just been punched in the stomach. His huge
shoulders sag.

Ox
Jesus, Peter...

bDocTOR
I‘m sorry but we’re doing
everything we can.

Ox stares helplessly at his unconscious son. The rest of the
family are in disbelief. The room is deathly silent.

SAUL
Are you a specialist?!

MIDGE
How could this happen?

~- *

A VOICE pipes up from the corner of the roon.

LUCY

He was pushed off e# subway
platforn.

The family turns. Lucy, stands against the wall by the door.

Ox
Who are you?

DOCTOR
That’s his fiance. Now please...

The Conlons look stunned. Everyone looks at each other.

MIDGE
His fiance?

Lucy looks confused.
ELSIE

(shocked)
Peter’s engaged?
16

DOCTOR
(surprised)
Yes...I thought...

The Conlons are reeling. Ox looks at Midge.

MIDGE
He would have told us.

ELSIE
(diplomatically)
Maybe he’s been busy.

Ox looks angrily at Peter.

ox
(bel lows)
Too busy to tell his own
mother he’s getting married!

MARY
Don't yell at hin!

ox
I’m not yelling at him!

The intern who barred Lucy in the emergency room barges in.

INTERN
What are you doing in here! -

Wanda steps in front of the intern.

WANDA ,«
(belligerently)
She saved his life...

KIDGE
{to Lucy)
You saved his life?

LUCY
Yes, but...

The Conlons are astonished.
Ox
I thought he got pushed off

Lucy
He did...

WANDA
She jumped on the tracks.
17

SAUL
You jumped on the tracks?

Lucy
Yes, but...

INTERN
(whines to doctor)
It’s family members only.

Ox glares at the intern.

Ox
(powerfully)
She is family!

DOCTOR
(hisses angrily)
She’s the fiance, you idiot.

The intern scurries out of the room. Lucy looks dazed. Midge
dooks at Lucy.

MIDGE
We haven’t seen him. We
didn’t know...

Lucy is speechless. Midge fills up.

MIDGE ~
I wanted so much for him to
find someone.

She looks at Lucy emotionally. ,
HIDGE
Thank God he found you!

Midge breaks down. Hugs Lucy and sobs into her chest. Lucy is
trapped. The whole room is choked with emotion. The rest of the
family embraces Lucy. Lucy stands in the middle of the room in
shock.

cur TO:
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM ~ LATER

Lucy sits rigidly on the couch. Ox paces. The rest of the
family deo their best to distract themselves. Elsie plays Chinese
checkers with Mary. Midge looks exhausted. Saul dozes. His
head falls against Lucy’s shoulder. The door opens and DALTON
CHARLES eases in. He’s wearing his charcoal Brooks Brothers suit
to match the somber occasion.
DALTON
(gravely)
Dalton Charles, colleague of
Peter’s at Lubel, Parker,
Jacobs and Fink.

Ox
I’m Peter’s father.

Dalton grips Ox’s hand firmly.

DALTON
He spoke highly of you.

Ox
We haven’t seen each other

Dalton smiles uneasily.

MIDGE
You know Lucy?
DALTON

Lucy dashes after her. Wanda’s caught.

Lucy
What am ‘! gonna do?

WANDA
(defensive)
I didn’t know they were going
to show up. J was trying to help.

Lucy
She hugged me so tight...I
couldn’t tell her.

WANDA
I know, I know...

Lucy
I’ve got to tell.

Lucy takes a deep breath, turns and bumps into Saul Tuttle.

SAUL
(to Wanda)
You can tell me. Is he gonna

die?

(claps his hands

over his ears)
I don’t want to know. Is there
a pharmacy in the hospital?.

WANDA
What do you need?
SAUL .
Elsie needs her nitroglycerin
pills. .
WANDA
Nitroglycerin? She has a heart
problen?
Lucy looks alarmed.
SAUL

Problem! She’s had three heart
attacks already. You know what
her blood pressure is...

Lucy shakes her head.

SAUL
High. To the roof. It would
be through the roof if it wasn’t |
for you. I’m tellin’ you...
Saul exhales.

SAUL
I think you saved her life. I
think you saved the whole family.

CLOSEUP ON LUCY. HOLD. PULL BACK.

LUCY sits on the couch again. Ox still paces. Mary sleeps in
her mother’s lap. Elsie has her hands folded over her ample
belly and looks at Lucy.

Everyone turns

Ox pipes up.

ELSIE
(smiles)
So tell us how you met Peter.

MIDGE
Ma... she doesn’t want to talk
about that now.

ELSIE
Why not? We could all use a
nice story.

and looks at Lucy. Lucy squirms.

SAUL
So how do you know it’s nice?
- ELSIE =°
Of course it’s nice. Why wouldn't
it be nice?

SAUL
What about that last girl...what’s
her name? He met her in a4 bar.

Ox
(disdainfully)
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
MIDGE
OX.-+
Ox
What?
MIDGE

Is that nice talk?

Ox
All I know is she was pretty
high and mighty for someone
named after a breakfast meat.
MIDGE
Well he has a nice girl now.

Lucy smitkes painfully. The room goes silent again. They
stare at JTary.

ELSIE
(smiles)
I‘ll bet it was love at first
sight.
(coaxes )
Right...

Lucy nods.
ELSIE
I have a sense about these
things.

SAUL
Will you let her tell it.

ELSIE
She is telling it.
(to Lucy)
I’1l bet he picked you up in
that fancy car he drives.

LUCY
(shakes her head)
We were waiting for a train,

SAUL
(impressed)
A train...Claudette Colbert met
Joel McCrea on a'‘train in Palm
Beach Story.

ELSIE
I told you it was a nice story.

MIDGE
What was it about him...you

---It was magical.

SAUL
They’re caps. $600 a tooth.

Elsie shushes him. Ox stops pacing and joins the group around

Lucy. They all] look at her expectantly.
22

Lucy
Well, we saw each other, he smiled
and the next thing I knew...we were
in each other’s arms.

SAUL
Cover your ears, Mary.

Ox puts his hands over the little girl’s ears. Everyone laughs.

Lucy
(sincerely)
And I knew when I first held
him that I couldn’t leave hin.

PULL BACK SLOWLY.

Lucy
And I knew my life would never
be the same...

Lucy sits in the waiting room with the whole family gathered
around her. The CAMERA edges out through the doors. Lucy’s
voice and the scene, FADES.

INT. CHOC-FULL-OF-NUTS ~ NEXT DAY

Jerry and Lucy sit at a table by the window. Jerry sips a cup of
coffee and shrugs.
JERRY =
What’s the big deal.

Lucy i
What’s the big deal! They think
I’m their future daughter-in-law
The grandmother has a heart condition.
If I tell them the truth she'll have
a heart attack and die and it will
be on ny head.

SERRY
So go along with it. When the coma
guy...what his name...

Lucy
(snaps)
Peter.
JERRY

What’s the matter?

Lucy
I told you his name five times.
23

JERRY
The guy’s unconscious Lucy. It’s
not like he’s your boyfriend or
anything.

Lucy doesn*t answer.

JERRY
Right?

Lucy
Of course right. I don’t even
know hin.

Jerry loos at her strangely. Lucy avoids his look.

JERRY
When Peter comes out of the coma
the family will be so happy and re-
lieved they won’t care if you lied
to them. They‘ll probably thank
you for it.

The waitress comes over with their orders. Lucy looks at her
roast beef sandwich.

LUCY
I ordered tuna.

The waitress snatches the sandwich and stalks off.

Lucy
What if he doesn’t come out of
his coma? s

JERRY
Then who’s to know?

LucY

(unconvinced)

Jerry...

JERRY

Listen, when my mother found out
I was marrying my wife her in-
testines ruptured. If you tell
them now you might as well shoot

grandma.
Lucy
(groans)
On God.
JERRY ,

You shouldn’t have left the booth.

INT. LUC¥’S APARTMENT
Lucy walks in. Her phone’s ringing. She picks it up.

Lucy
Hello?

abruptly changes lanes.

SAUL
Did you know I’m Peter’s God-

Lucy
(surprised)
I thought you had to be Catholic?

SAUL

Ox fudged it over with Father
Shea. He donated the oak for
the new church pews.

(pause)
Being a Godfathey is very important
to Catholics. It means you’re
practically part of the family.

LUCY
Youfre lucky. It’s nice to have
someone to watch "It’s a Wonderful

The communion hymn begins. Parishioners file toward the altar.
JACK
He wasn’t talking to the family

The people in the pew behind them kneel so they can listen.

It’s because of the fish.

Everyone looks uncomfortable.

Jack steps out of the Conlons‘ pew and walks against the traffic.

Jack angrily searches in his pants pocket and finds his wallet.
He opens it, yanks out his driver’s license and thrusts it at
her. Lucy looks at it.

JACK
That’s a New York driver’s
license.

LUCY

It’s expired.

Jack grabs his license back, It's expired, Jack is totally
frustrated. Lucy creeps into the parking lot.

Lucy
Lucky thing I’m driving.

Lucy slows.
LUCY
So what’s his type?

JACK
I just can’t picture him dating

reason he rides the subway is
because he paid $70,000 for that

even my body fat. 7 percent.

Lucy
Do you remember the squirrels?
PETER
The squirrels. The picture in
the paper.
LUCY
(nods)

You saved then.

PETER
Not exactly. Actually what
happened was I was cutting
through the woods with my
friends and we hit their nest
with rocks.

Lucy looks disappointed.

PETER
(quickly)
Then I saved then. =

LucY
(disillusioned)
I don’t think that counts.

PETER
(nods)
I’ve never told anyone the
truth about that before.

LUCY
Now it’s my turn.

Peter waits. Lucy takes a deep breath. She looks over her
shoulder to make sure no one’s listening.

LUCY
I’m not your fiance.

PETER
Listen, if you’re mad about
the squirrels that was a long
time ago.
102

LUCY
I work in a subway token booth.
We don’t even know each other.

PETER
(conspiratorially)
We don’t?

Lucy
You can’t say anything because if
your grandmother finds out she’s a
goner.

Peter nods.
Lucy
(whispers)
We were never engaged.

There’s silence. Lucy looks relieved that she’s finally told the
truth. Peter starts crying. Lucy is stunned.

PETER

You’re protecting me.

(sobs)

You must love me very much.
Lucy

I’m not protecting you!

Peter’s doctor and a nurse walk in. ~

DOCTOR

Excuse me, we need to take
his temperature. '

Peter opens his mouth.

NURSE
Not there.

Peter grimaces. He rolls over. The doctor looks at Lucy. Lucy
leaves.

Jack sits in a chair and pulls it to Peter’s bedside.

JACK
Listen, I know you don’t need
advice from me but I’m going to
give you some anyway.

Peter yawns.

JACK
Lucy’s the best thing that ever
happened to you. Treat her right.

Peter puts down his sandwich. He eyes Jack suspiciously.

PETER
What are you saying?

JACK
(fidgets)
I’m saying she’s a great girl.

PETER
What’s going on?

JACK
Nothing’s going on.

PETER ‘
(angrily)
This is my wife we’re talking
about, Jack.

JACK
You don’t even remember her.

PETER
It’s coming back.

JACK
Do you remember the way she
touched you? Do you remember
how she lcoks when the snow is
falling and how the streetlight
shines on her? Do you remember
@riving home and missing the exit
you’ve taken a million times because
you can’t stop thinking about her?

Jack looks intently at Peter.
105

JACK
Do you remember loving her?

PETER
I remember who killed my fish.

JACK
(angrily)
ho cares about your goddam fish!

PETER
Ido! You overfeed my fish and
everyone thinks it’s a big joke.
(mimics)
Oh, well, that’s just Jack.
(angrily)
All my life I’ve worked hard and
met goals while you plan to take
the stairs out of the house and put
in an escalator.

JACK
So what?

PETER
So gain some responsibility.

JACK
I have responsibility. It’s to my
family. Something you’v@® forgotten
about.
Peter doesn’t answer. He looks angrily at Jack.
PETER
(firmly) -
I’m moving the wedding up.

Jack stands--ready to explode. He points at Peter, turns and
walks out.

INT. ELEVATORS

Jack stalks on. The elevator opens. Lucy steps off more
determined then we've ever seen her.

Lucy bursts into the hall.

SAUL

Peter’s dying. ~

Lucy
What are you talking about?

'
SAUL «

I heard the doctor. He’s got

two weeks to Jive.

Lucy
The doctor said that?

Saul nods.
Lucy
Are you sure?

SAUL
Sure as the Kaiser is German.

Lucy sways. She grabs the wall to keep her balance.

Lucy
Does the family know?

SAUL
Nobody knows. You’ve got to :
marry hin.
107

Lucy
Are you nuts!

SAUL
He loves you.

LUCY
He doesn’t know me!

SAUL
He thinks he does. Besides
think about the Conlons.

LUCY
What do you mean?

SAUL
They’11 be losing a son.
If you get married at least
they’11 be gaining a daughter.
It‘ll temper their grief.

LUCY
What if he doesn’t die?

SAUL
He’s a lawyer, a girl could
do worse.

Lucy = ¢
I can’t do it, Saul.

Lucy paces.
SAUL ‘
Lucy, if you marry Peter, you’1]
be a member of the family forever.

Lucy
(embarrassed)
A wedding invitation.

JERRY
It’s your wedding invitation.

JERRY
Now you’re his widow! You

Good, I can return your wedding

The BMW stops. Lucy gets out and sneaks to the house. She sees
Jack getting undressed in his wpstairs bedroom window. She
stealthily moves along the hedges, digs some gravel out of the
cold, hard ground and tosses it against his window. She waits.
Nothing. She tosses some pebbles. The stones rattle against the
window. Still nothing. Lucy throws a snowball. The snowball
bangs off the window, ricochets and hurtles back at her. Lucy
trips. Dogs bark. The light comes on in Jack’s roon.

JACK

Lucy hushes hin.

As he pushes Lucy inside we CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL CHAPEL

There’s a small crowd in the chapel. Mostly people in
wheelchairs or with walkers. The Conions are lined up in the
first pew. They keep looking toward the door. Ox looks anxious.

Ox
I should have picked her-up.

MIDGE
She‘ll be here, Ox.
Ox ”
{looks at his watch)
Maybe she forgot.

MIDGE ‘
A woman doesn't forget her wedding.

Peter and Jack walk out of the side room to the altar. They look
hostile. The wedding march comes to an end. The priest looks
toward the back door for the bride. Nothing. The organist
starts playing again.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY

Lucy and Saul run down the hall. The wedding march begins again.
Saul gets to the doorway.

Oh my God!

Will he survive the ceremony?

INT. CHAPEL

Lucey practically sprints down the aisle. The organist plays
twice as fast to keep up. The chapel buzzes. She bounds up to
the altar next to Peter. She's out of breath.

PRIEST

Dearly beloved...We are
gathered here today...

SAUL(o.s)

Saul runs down the aisle. The chapel is in shock. He runs up to

The priest is flustered. Ox edges up to the altar. Whispers.

Ox

LUCY
I’m in love with your son.

I know.
LUCY

Not that one.

The priest shuts his bible. ox is pissed at Jack.

Ox
What the hell did you do?!

Lucy

He didn't do anything. It was

me, Remember the first day at the
hospital? Well, there was a mix-
up. I saw Peter get pushed on
the tracks and I saved his life.
Only when I got to the hospital
they wouldn’t let me see him so
the nurse told the doctor I was
his fiance only it’s not true.

Jack is stunned. Everyone stares at Lucy--confused.

PETER
(relieved) >
Thank God.
LUCY
I didn’t know how to tell you.
(beat)

I was never engaged to Peter.
We never even met until that
day in the subway. But when we
were in the hospital room every-
thing happened so fast. At first
I couldn’t tell you the truth and
then I didn’t want to tell you the
truth. Because the truth was. I
fell in love with yor. All of yon.
I went from being all alone to having...

a fiance...

a daughter...

a granddaughter...

a friend...
{looks at Mary)
and a sister.

Lucy looks at Peter.

Lucy
I saved your life that day
in the subway but you really
saved mine. You let me be part
of your family. And even if it
was only for a little while, 1711

Lucy looks at Jack.

LUCY
(softly)
Jefferson and Roosevelt.

JACK

LUCY
Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and
Roosevelt. Mt. Rushmore. I’m going
to go see it. I already called a travel
agent. And I’m going to Florence next.

JACK
What about your job?

Lucy .
It’s time to leave the both.

Lucy quickly turns and heads back down the aisle. The family
stands in stunned silence. Lucy stops. She turns to Peter.
t

Lucy
Sorry about your car.

PETER
What about my car!

The doors of the chapel fly open. Bacon storms in.
BACON
Peter Conlon’s engaged to me!
I object to this wedding!

PRIEST
Get in line.

An elegantly dressed older man follows Bacon in.

STRANGER
I object to your objection.
115

JACK
Who’s that?

,, PETER
(sheepishly)
Ashley’s husband.

JACK
You proposed to a married woman?

PETER
(angrily)
I was in a coma and you made
a play for my fiance.

Jack and Peter argue. The chapel’s in an uproar! Everyone’s
arguing. Lucy walks past Bacon. Bacon and her husband are
yelling at each other.

Joe Jr. busts in,

JOE JR.
I object!

LUCY
The wedding’s off.

JOE JR.
(proudly)
I guess the better man wen.”

Lucy walks out. Arguing and shouting fill the chapel behind her.

train rattles along an elevated track. A barking dog is drowned
out as the train rumbles past rows of tenements and rocks past
the hospital.

They hug. Celeste opens the booth.

CELESTE
You take care.

Lucy nods. Celeste leaves. Lucy’s alone. A few commuters cone
up to the window and buy tokens. Lucy turns on the radio. She
pulls a photograph out of her pocket. It’s the picture of Lucy
with the Conlons at Christmas. In the picture, Lucy stands front
and center with a big smile on her face. Lucy’s eyes fill.

Suddenly an object slides through the token slot. She looks at
it. It’s a diamond ring. Lucy looks up. The entire Conlon
family, including Saul, stands by the booth. Jack looks at her
through the glass.

JACK
Lucy, will you marry ne?

Lucy is overwhelmed. She picks up the ring tenderly.

ELSIE
