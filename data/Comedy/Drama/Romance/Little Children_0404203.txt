FADE IN:
SIGHTS & SOUNDS OF WINDING MOVEMENTS ON VARIOUS TIMEPIECES.

Tick Tock, the rhythm overwhelming: Ansonia shelf, wall, mantel,
long-case, table, and bracket. Each movement open escapement.

THE HARD NG OF A ENGINE

HOUSE APTER HOUSE ~- TOWN AFTER TOWN ~ AS SEEN FROM A TRAIN.

The strains of a NEWSCAST,

An ANCHOR WOMAN front and center, super~imposed images behind her,

ANCHOR WOMAN

It has only been two weeks since an East
adam man, Ronald James McGorvey |

returned home from prison after serving
a two-year sentence for indecent
exposure to a minor. And already a
grassroots movement is clamoring to
remove him from the community.

News B-Roll: BADLY XEROXED FLYERS on TELEPHONE POLES depicting a
lump man with wiry, thinning hair and an anxious expression. In
id script it reads: Are your children safe?

_ ANCHOR WOMAN
The group is called The Committee of
Concerned Parents.

A CLOSER DETAIL on the BOTTOM EDGE identifies the supplier of the
flyer as The Committee of Concerned Parents.

ANCHOR WOMAN
Police are advising parents to...

The newscast continues as we WIDEN within a dark livingroom to REVEAL
A MAN sitting in a LA-Z-BOY watching the broadcast. His hand grips a
glass of soda and ice. He takes a sip.

BLACK. COMPLETE SILENCE. A LEGEND APPEARS: LITTLE CHILDREN
Then —
WOMAN'S VOICE .
My husband and I had an actual spiritual
experience...
EXT. WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND ~ DAY

pois is THERESA, mid-thirties, a pale woman, but in her time a real
auty.

THERESA
+;.We were on our vacation in Cabo with
eight other couples, and this Mayan
woman... a goddess, just a goddess...
 

 

MARY ANN, mid-thirties, toothpick-thin, uptight, and clad in
CATALOGUE CASUAL.

HARY ANE
She’s due in September. She says she’s
gonna take three months off, and be back
to work before Christmas. Please. Six
months from now she'll be right here on
this bench with us...

CUr TO:

CHERYL, a woman who has the unfortunate habit of ending her sentences
with an upwardy teenagery question mark.

CHERYL
Well, my friend Beth said the way she did
it, was to just take him with her every
time she went to the bathroom,

. MARY ANN
I find that strange.

CHERYL
That's what I said to Beth.

MARY ANN
It's oedipal.

THERESA .
What's the rush? Although, I will say
when I was potty training Christian? I
opened the diaper and it was huge, like a
grown man.

Snatches of the women talking begin a slow diminuendo, as they shift
to the subject of pre-schools.

On the bench opposite the women is SARAH PIERCE, 30. It is through
Sarah's ears that we have been introduced to these ladies. And because
of this, our idea of them may be less than kind.

As we PUSH IN on her — A NEW VOICE EMERGES. If 1S , CALM, AND NON-
SUDGMENTAL, IN SHORT, GROWN-UP.

VOICE
Smiling politely to mask a familiar
feeling of desperation, Sarah reminded
herself to think like an anthropologist.
She was a researcher studying
behavior of typical suburban women. She
was not a typical suburban woman herself,

CHERYL
John and I were having sex the other
night, and I drifted off right in the
middle of it.

THERESA |
{chuckles sympathetically}
Tt happens.
CHERYL
I guess. But when I woke up and
apologized? He said he hada’t even
noticed.

MARY ANN |
You know what you should de? Set aside a
specific block of time for making love.
That's what Lewis and I do. Every Tuesday
night at nine o’clock.

VOICE
Whether you want to or not, Sarah
thought, her eyes straying over to the
play area...

CHRISTIAN, Theresa’s son, pummels Mary Ann‘’s cowering TROY and -

Cheryl's COURTNEY shows Mary Ann’s ISABELLE her DORA THE EXPLORER
underpants.

VOICE
Even at such a tiny playground as this,
Lucy didn’t interact much with the other
children,

Sarah's three-year-old daughter LUCY, stands alone near the top of
the slide. She appears to talking to herself.

Sarah takes her in.

VOICE
Sarah didn’t really know why they even
bothered coming here, except that she'd
probably go crazy, trapped in the house
all day with this unknowable little
person.

CLOSE ON a watch face. The second hand sweeps past twelve...

VOICE
Morning snack time wag ten thirty on the
dot. A regimen established and maintained
by Mary Ann...

MARY ANN’s face fills the screen as she turns and soundlessly barks
toward the playground.

VOICE
+, who believed that rigid adherence to a
timetable...

The children all turn toward Mary Ann in SLOW MOTION and start
running in her direction,

VOICE
+2-Was not only the key to a healthy
marriage, but toe effective parenting as
well.
CLOSE ON HANDS DIGGING THROUGH A DIAPER BAG.

All the kids,

LUCY {0.C.)
Mommy?

and their mothers are gathered around a picnic table,

shoveling CHEERIOS and GOLDFISH into their months ~

Except for Sarah who is crouched down on the grass a few feet away
rummaging through a diaper bag. Lucy stands facing her mother, an

anxious look on the chi

drama that is

BACK TO SARAH

s face.

Lucy
Where my snack?

SARA
(digging through bag
I'm sure it’s in here somewhere.

Lucy
Where it went? Where my snack?

SARAH . .
I’m sorry, honey. Mommy can’t find it.
(to other mothers)
I forgot the rice cakes. I mst have left
them on the counter.

BENCH the three women, and their offspring watch the
playing out on the grass before them.

CHERYL
Poor thing.

LUCY {0.C.)
I want my snaaaack!

|_MARY ANN
(pointed)
That's the second time this week.
THERESA .
It's hard to keep track of everything.

LUCY (0.C.)
Bad Mommy, bad mommy, bad mommy.

& LUCY

pleading)»
Just calm down.
No! No calm down!

It's not here.

i
Sarah hands her the bag.

. SARAB
Alright, here, See for yourself.

Lucy looks into the bag, and then throws it at her mother’s head.
Sarah winds up with thé strap dangling around her neck.

MARY ANN
Wait!

This single word radiates with such undeniable adult authority that
everything stops.

MARY ANN ;
Troy, honey? Give Lucy your Goldfish.

TROY
Not

He turns his body, forming a barrier between Lucy ahd his snack:

MARY ANN
Troy Jonathan. Give me those Goldfish.

TROY )
(whimpering
But mama, they’re mine.

MARY ANN .
No backtalk. You can share with your
sister.

With no further word of protest, Troy hands the BAG to Mary Ann.

SARAR
(to Lucy) .
Go and sit down, Troy has goldfish for
you,

Lucy runs over to join the others at the picnic bench.
SARAE

{to Mary Ann)
Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

MARY ANN
It’s nothing. I just hate to see her
suffer like that.
Sarah gets down on one knee and begins refilling the diaper bag.
MARY ANN .
Maybe you should make a check list, tape
it to the door so it’s the last thing you
see before leaving the house. That’s what
I do.
Sarah looks up, forcing a smile.

SARAE
Thank you. That's a really helpful
suggestion.
Cheryl's head darts away from the other mothers. She reaches across
the table and grabs Theresa’s hand.

CHERYL
(soft and urgent}
Look.

Theresa glances instinctively toward the PLAY STRUCTURE.

what? THERESA
at?

CHERYL
Over there. The Prom King?

_. THERESA
(smiling)
Oh my God. He’s back.
Sarah looks up from the diaper bag.

VOICE
Sarah followed the other women’s gazes
over to the entrance of the playground,
eager to finally get a glimpse of the
Prom King...

In the middle distance, we see a strapping BLOND MAN enter through
the park’s iron gate. He pushes a STROLLER. One side is empty
and other is occupied by a large STUFFED BEAR. The man’s three~
year-old son sits perched on his father’s shoulders. He wears a
JESTER’S CAP, and shoots his arms out as if he is flying.

VOICE
«+. the handsome and mysterious young
father who had been a regular at the
Walker Street Playground for several
weeks this past spring, before abruptly
dropping out of sight.

With the ease of someone Performing a familiar action, the man lifts

his son off his shoulders, and gallops around the play structure. The

boy squeals as the man bobs, hops, and weaves ~ giving the boy the

time of his life. Unlike the young mothers on the benches watching

their children from a distance, this man is engaged. As if he

couldn't imagine doing anything else, with anyone else, More playmate
an parent.

VOICE
His departure had left a gaping hole in
the emotional lives of Cheryl, Theresa,
and Mary Ann. Barely a day went by
without one of them’ s ating wistfully
about the reason for his absence and the
likelihood of his return.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM ~ DAY
The blond man from the playground rises in and out of frame. This is
BRAD ADAMSON, 30. He is sweating, and breathing heavily, at the end
of a long circuit of daily push-ups.
BRAD
++. One hundred.
KITCHEN
Brad, wearing PLAY~TEX GLOVES, stands at the sink doing dishes.
HALLWAY
Brad vacuums.
LIVING ROOM — LATER (MAGIC)
Brad and Aaron sit on the floor engrossed in their favorite activity:
Train Wreck, a brutally simple game. GORDON and PERCY, two characters
from Thomas the Tank Engine, move in opposite directions around a
circular track, making happy CHUGGING SOUNDS right up to the moment of
an inevitable collision.
AARON
{shouting}
Splang?
This is the sound effect that always accompanies the crash.
AARON
fake that, Gordon.
BRAD
Ouch! That hurt, Percy.
Aaron laughs uproariously at Brad’s pain.

. __AARON
Again! Again!

They set-up for another go, and repeat the game.

The game ends abruptly though, as Aaron scrambles to his feet and
stares toward the The SOUND of someone coming through the FRONT DOOR.

ARRON
Mommy i

Re rips the Jester cap off his head and flings it away.

Brad watches the haberdashery make a wide arc in the air. He cannot
take his eyes from it. Time seems to momentarily stop.

VOICE
The Jester‘s cap was something that truly
disturbed Brad. All day long The boy ate,
played, and napped in it. He would burst
inte tears if nis Father had so much
suggested it be removed.
VOICE (CONT) .
But the moment his Mother stepped In the
house he had no more use for it, as if the
entire day up to that point had been a
pointless and somewhat useless charade.

Aaron flies into the arms of KATHY, 30, and lovely. She drops to one
knee, and holds her arms out wide.

. KATHY
I missed you so so so so mich.

He buries his face against her chest; she strokes his head.
RATEY ,
You got some color, didn't you? Did daddy
forget the sunscreen again?

Brad stares down at the engine he still holds. Gordon’s peevish
expression feels like it’s mocking him.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, KITCHEN ~ MAGIC
Brad, Kathy & Aaron sit around the table at the tail end of dinner.
. BRAD .
I think I’m gonna finally break down and
get a mobile phone.
KATHY
Really? Why?
BRAD .
I have no way of reaching you when I’m
out with Aaron.
KATHY
{to Aaron
You're done, right?
She rises to clear the boy’s dish, and carries it over to the sink.

BRAD . .
+» you've got one. Don’t you think it's
strange I don’t?

KATHY
Yeah, I do. You just never wanted one
before.
She wets a towel, and heads back over to Aaron.
BRAD
Yeah, I know. There's a family plan. We
can talk for free,

Kathy cleans the dinner from Aaron's face, and in the process turns
her back on an uncomfortable fiscal conversation.

EATRY
Let’s see where we are at the end of the
month.
EXT. MAIN STREET — TWILIGHT

Carrying a briefcase, Brad walks alone along an empty street, He passes
an SUV swathed in graphics for the National Guards A recruiting vehicle,
and handy piece of mobile advertisement, A TRIO OF DRAB GREEN Sab
SOLDIERS stare back at him: defiant and brave.

VOICE
As was her custom, each weeknight after
dinner, the boy's mother sent Brad down
to the Municipal library to study for
the bar exam...

EXT. MUNICIPAL LIBRARY ~ TWILIGHT

VOICE .
..-but he never quite made it through the
door of the building.

Brad settles in on a bench. About twenty yards away, FOUR,
SKATEBOARDERS, ages thirteen to sixteen, dressed in knee-length
shorts, baggy T-shirts, and fashionably retro sneakers ~ jump stairs,
metal railings, and retaining walls around a square granite
building. They are all armed with iPODS & MOBILE PHONES.

VOICE
Brad had been watching the boys for weeks
now, sometimes for as long as an hour at a
stretch, but he'd never received the
slightest acknowledgement from any of them,

Brad stares longingly.

VOICE
He had been the same age as these boys
when his mother died.

ONE OF THE BOYS, the one the others call G, ramps off a wall and
sails into the air. He possesses an almost mystical connection to his
board. G returns to the group, whe congratulate him on his last ride.

VOICE
I must have been like this, Brad
sometimes thought. I must have been one
of them.

MARY ANN {0.C.}
He should just be castrated.

EXT. WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND ~ DAY
CLOSE ON the same Randbill from the news broadcast, with the addition of
a stepped-up headline: Decent people Beware!!! There is a Pervert Among
Si
The MOTHERS all stare down at the FLYER on the picnic table.
MARY ANN |
Quick and clean, Just chop it off. Then

you wouldn't have to worry about
notifying the neighbors.
SARAR .

You know what else you should do? Nail
his penis above the entrance to the
elementary school. You know, as a warning
to other perverts.

Cheryl and Theresa chuckle politely at her sarcasm. Mary Amn is not
amused, and fixee Sarah with an icy glare.

. MARY ANN
You think this is funny?

SARAE
I just can’t believe you want to castrate
aman for indecent exposure.

THERESA
My brother used to expose himself, when
we were teenagers. He'd do it in my ~
bedroom, or in the backseat of the car,
even at the dinner table. He always
figured out a way to do it so that no one
could see what he was up to but me.

____ MARY
. {disgusted}
Didn’t you tell anyone?
THERESA
(puzzled) .
No, I didn’t want to get him in trouble.

It didn’t stop until he went away to
college.

SARAH
He should have been castrated.
MARY ANN
(snapping)
It’s not the same thing. He wasn’t doing
it to strangers.
Cheryl's head swivels as if pulled by a magnet.
CHERYL .
Oh My God, look! After all this time.
There he ig. Two days in a row?

Brad and Aaron have arrived at the playground gate.

_ SARAH
Maybe he just needed a vacation.

MARY ANN
{suspicious}
From what?

; THERESA _
From being the Prom King.

~10-
 

~Lie

| CHERYL
Tt’s a dirty job.
(chuckling) .
But someone’s gok to do it.

As Brad and Aaron pass the women on their way over to the far swing-
set, the trio go completely silent ~ pretending not to notice.

Sarah wetches them ~ amused.

SARAB
What's he do for a living?
The others look nervous, and ignore the question.
MARY ANN
(uncomfortable)
We've never actually spoken to him.
. .,, SARAH
You're kidding right?
THERESA
We don’t even know his name.
SARAH .
Really? I thought you said he was a
regular here.
THERESA.
It was awkward,

CHERYL

He made us nervous, You had to think

about what you were going to wear in the

morning? Put on makeup? It was

exhausting?
lucy leaves her position at the top of the SLIDE and wanders over to
the SWING-SET right next to where Brad pushes Aaron. She calis to her
mother.

LUCY
Mommy! Push mei

SARAH
Alright. I’Li be right there.

Sarah smiles at the women, wondering how they'll react to her impending
proximity to “The Prom King." As she rises to go, Theresa calls out.

waits THERESA (0.C.}
ALCL

Sarah stops.

SARAH
What?

Theresa holds up her WALLET, smixking like a schoolgirl.
CHERESA
Five bucks if you get his phone number.

SWING SET — MOMENTS LATER

Aaron observes lucy with a certain amount of skepticism as she swings in
near-unison beside him, He turns to Sarah, his expression unexpectedly

serious.

How old is she?
SARAH

(coaxing) | .
Lucy, honey. Tell the nice boy how old
you are.

BARON
I’m three!

He jabs the corresponding fingers into the air.

AARON |
My grandmother lives in New Jersey! She
doesn't have a swim pool.

SARAB
to the boy}
Do you like to swim?

AARON
I don’t like sharks. They eat you up.

BRAD
Don’t listen to him. We go to the town
pool almost every day.

Brad smiles at Sarah.

BRAD
I’m Brad, by the way.
She smiles back.

SARAR
Sarah.

BRAD
You guys come here a lot?

SARAH
Only for the last few weeks. We used to
go to the one over on Harris, with the
big wood things, and the slide across.

BRAD
Yeah, we actually rent a place right arcund
the corner from there on Ashforth. But that
ice cream truck never leaves ~ what 4
nightmare.
“13

SARAZ
Tell me about it.

BRAD .
+..you know, you're the first person here
who's ever talked to me.

SARAH
You make them nervous.

BRAD
Oh, right. I guess they don’t see too
many fathers here during the weekdays.

They keep pushing the children.

BRAD .
You don’t have to be polite. Go ahead and ask.

SARA
What?

BRAD
What the person who wears the pants in
the family does for a living.

. SARAB
Alright, what does your wife do?
BRAD
She makes documentaries.
SARAH
Oh, wow. Like, Michael Moore?
Like, PBS.

SARAH .

Oh... well, I think it’s admirable that

ou‘re here, There's no reason men can’t
primary caregivers.

BRAD
I finished law school two years ago. But
I can't seem to pass the bar exam. Failed
it twice now.

, SARAH
Maybe you just don't want to be a lawyer.

Brad looks momentarily startled by this suggestion.

BRAD
T'll take the test one more time. If I
mess up Row, I’m just going to have to
find something else to do with my life.

They go back to their swinging.
oj dm

VOICE

Sarah was shocked by how Brad delivered
this confession, with no apparent sense
ef being in the least bit embarrassed by
his failure. Most men weren’t like this.
Her husband, Richard, certainly wasn‘t.
She wondered if Brad was always this
forthcoming. If anything, he seemed a
little lonely, ali too ready to open his
heart at the slightest sign of interest,
like a lot of young mothers she knew.

Sarah breaks the silence.

SARAH
I couidn‘t help poticing your stroller.
Do you have another child’

BRAD
Just Aaron. We got that at a yard sale.
fhe extra seat comes in handy for the
ar.

SARAH
Lucy refuses to be put into a stroller,
or @ car seat. We have to walk everywhere.
Tt takes us half an hour to go three
blocks, unless I carry her.
___ BARON
Daddy finish.
BRAD
You sure? We just got here.
ARRON
Daaady, I finish right now.
. BRAD
Alright. One, two, three.
He stops the swing, leaves Aaron, and attends to the bear. He pulls
it out of the swing, and straps it imto the stroller. Then comes back
or Aaron.

Sarah watches in silence as he cups Aaron by the armpits and attempts
to lift him out of the swing.

The boy’s foot gets caught in one of the apertures, and she hurries
over to free it before Brad has a chance to ask for assistance.

BRAD
Thanks.
No problem.

Sarah watches as Brad buckles Aaron into the stroller.
VOICE
< was then, while watching Brad kneel
down at his son’s feet, that Garah found
herself gripped by an unexpected pang of
sadness.

She looks toward the opposite end of the playground - The women
leaning forward on their bench, completely riveted.

VOICE
Don’t go, she thought. Don’t leave me
here with the others.
Brad stands and turns toward her, as if he’d read her mind.
_ BRAD |
(curious smile)
Well, it was nice talking to you.

SARAH
Yeah, you too.

He starts to leave.

SARAHB
(suddenly)
Hey.

Brad stops and looks at her, confused.

BRAD
Yes?
SARAH |
{conspiratorial}
Come here.
BRAD
what?

Just,..come here.

fle does as he's told.

SARAB
You see those women over there?
He glances in the direction of the PICNIC TABLE. All of the women
suddenly look in the other direction
SARAB
Yeah. Don’t look. Don’t look, You know
what they call you? .

Be takes a small step toward Sarah, intrigued.

BRAD
What?

nL 5
~16—

SARAH
The Prom King.
BRAD
Ouch. That's awful.
_ SARAH
They mean it as a compliment. You’re a
big character in their fantasy lives.
BRAD
Wow.
SARAH
One of them bet me five dollars I
couldn’t get your phone number.
,, BRAD
(smiling)
Five bucks, huh?

SARAH
Yep.

Brad shoots another look at the women.
BRAD
(teasing) .
Could we split it fifty-fifty?
SARAH
{right back at him)
It could be arranged.

A moment.
SARAH
Doesn’t have to be your real number.

BRAD
Well, in that case, sure.
Brad pats himself down, looking for a pen. Nothing.

BRAD
You got a pen?

Sarah doesn’t. She glances toward the table where her diaper bag is.
She doesn’t want to go there. She looks back to him.
SARAH
Oh, shit. Neo, no I don’t.

BRAD
Well, maybe next time.

He turns to go, but Sarah reaches out and grabs his arm.

. SARAR .
No, listen wait... just wait.
~ij~

He’s waiting. She’s thinking. Then ~

SARAE
You know what would really be funny?

BRAD
What?

SARA
-.Lf you gave me a hug.
., 8
(smiles)
You think?

SARA
+. -yeah.

Brad grins. He’s game.

BRAD
Well, alright come here.
Brad opens his arms, and Sarah steps into them. They hug.

MARY ANN (0.C.)
Ob, My God!

Mary Ann’s reaction makes them both start to giggle.
SARAR
{whispers
You wanna really freak them out?
Brad looks at her a moment. Then —

BRAD
«> Yeah,

He leans down and gives her a tentative kiss, half-serious, as if
they're acting in a play.

A COLLECTIVE GASP travels from the ladies at the picnic table to our
couple. Followed by a panicky chorus call from the mothers, summoning
their children from the play structure.

Brad & Sarah part... But they somehow can’t take their eyes off each
other,
SARAR
(glancing at the exodus)
I think that worked,
Both of them are blushing.
BRAD
{per panicky mothers}
+» yeah, I think so,

BRAD
Well, it was nice meeting you.
~ig-

SARAH
+e -¥eD, sum hmmm.

He sets off without another word. Sarah watches his broad back recede
as be pushes the stroller past the other mothers, and out of the park
gates.

She turns to Lucy, sitting motionless in the swing, watching the same
sight as her mother, her feet kicking dreamily in the air.

SARAH
Let's go.

She gathers Lucy from the swing, and carries her like a piece of
oversized luggage back to the bench to retrieve her things. Her face
burning with pride and with shame.

cheryl and Theresa huddle with their children, staring at Sarah in
comp: ete bewilderment. Flanked by Troy and Isabelle, Mary Ann looks
urious.

MARY ANN
I’m sure your daughter found that very
educational.

Sarah reaches down for the diaper bag, and turns to go.

SARAH
His name‘s Brad, He's a lawyer. And he’s
really very nice.

Sarah picks up Lucy and heads home.
EXT. FIELD — DAY

Sarah sits under a tree trying her level best to read Margaret
Atwood’s The Handmaid's Tale. After a moment, she puts it down, and
gazes off, distracted.

VOICE
For the past few days, Sarah hadn't
been able to concentrate on anything
but the Prom King...and the curious
thing that had happened between them
on the playground.

She glances the other direction, where, some distance away ~

LUCY squats on the grass, her back to Sarah, playing alone, and
talking to herself.

Sarah looks away from the child, and away into the expanse.

VOICE
She didn't feel shame or guilt, only a
sense of profound disoriehtation, as if
she had been kidnapped by aliens, and
fren released, unharmed, a few hours
ater.

Mother and child under the shade of the tree, In the distance, an
amphitheater of sorts, a white wing which resembles a flying saucer.
e SOUND af

 

VOICE
As he had so often in recent days...

BRAD sits on his usual bench under the beech tree. But instead of
watching the skateboarders, he closes his eyes. We PUSH IN O8 his
dreamy face,

VOICE
.,.Brad mentally re-enacted the kiss by
the swingset. He still couldn't believe
it had really happened, and with all
those women and children watching.

WE SEE AARON in his stroller at the playground that day looking up
toward Brad and Sarah.
VOICE
Aaron had been particularly curious about
what he'd seen,

IN BRAD'S LIVING ROOM he situates a BLOW-UP PUNCHING CLOWN. Aaron
stands opposite his father.

AARON
Why you hugging that lady?
BRAD
Well, see now, that’s what I'm trying tc
show you here with Bozo.
Brad kneels down in front of the clown.
. _, BRAD
Sometimes it’s a game grown-ups play when
their friends.
Re spreads his arms in an exaggerated way.

BRAD
See?

Brad mechanically embraces the clown.

; BRAD
fi, I’m your friend,

The boy's face wears & dubious look.

VOICE
Aaron was skeptical.

VOICE
They returned to the olayground the
following morning...

BRAD and AARON arrive to an empty PLAYGROUND.

{oe
VOICE
..-bub Ro one was there.

BRAD AND AARON at the TOWN POUL. Brad scans the other PACES.

VOICE
Sarah hadn’t shown up at the tow pool,
either, though Brad remembered telling
her that he and Aaron could be found
there most afternoons. It didn't seem to
matter that Sarah wasn’t his type:
+.Wasn’t even that pretty, at least not
compared to Kathy...

IDEALIZED VISIONS of KATHY, in the way the voice describes.

VOICE
.» who had long legs, and lustrous hair,
and perfect breasts,

BRAD continues his daydreaming.

VOICE
Sarah was short, and boyish ~ and had
eyebrows that were thicker than Brad
ought necessary.

All that is described above is seen.

VOICE
But even so, she'd walked into his arns
that day, as if she was fulfilling a
secret wish he hadn’t remembered making,

MAN (0.C.}
Hey, pervert!

Brad‘s eyes open, startled awake from his fantasy.

MAN {ec}
Yeah you, pervert

Brad cringes, as he looks toward —

A VAN-parked by the curb directly across from him. A man gestures
toward Brad from the vehicle's dark cab.

. MAN
Like little boys, do you?

The teasing note in the Man's voice is clearer now, and Brad drops his
guard and Squints into the van.

Meet LARRY HEDGES, 30. He wears a T-SHIRT with the word GUARDIANS
across the chest, and GRAY ATHLETIC SHORTS. He leans across the
passenger seat into the street-light, and grins at Brad.
BRAD
Larry?
LARRY

yeah, it's fucking Larry.
BRAD

Jesus, don’t even joke about that.
TARRY

What are you doing right now? You busy?
BRAD

Uh, actually, I'm supposed to be

studying.

Brad lifts his briefcase.
BRAD
I’m taking the bar exam next month.
LARRY
Didn't you do that last year?

BRAD
Yeah. See how well I did?

Larry laughs. He pops the lock on the passenger side.

TARRY
Get in. I got a better idea.
Brad hesitates.

LARRY
C'mon, c’mon, c'mon.

Brad does as he is told.

INT/EXT. LARRY’S VAN ~ NIGHT

As Brad climbs in, tarry clears off the passenger seat. He tosses a
FOOTBALL and a pair of BINOCULARS-into the back, and lifts up a fat
stack of BLUE PAPER.

LARRY
You mind?

He drops the stack onto Brad’s lap.

. LARRY
Imm trying to keep them nice.

Brad glances at the top sheet. It’s the same flyer we've seen
throughout the story. His eyes stray to the bottom of the page:
PRID FOR BY THE COMMITTEE OF CONCERNED PARENTS,

LARRY

BRAD :
Wow, that’s quite a commitment.

INT. LARRY’S VAN, MOVING ~ SAME
BRAD.
(somewhat impressed) |

How’d you find out about this creep?

LARRY .
There’s a web site. The state’s required
to disclose the whereabouts of convicted
sex offenders. Don't you check it?

BRAD

(covering)
Not on a regular basis.

Larry’s expression darkens.
xp:

LARRY
hey should just castrate the bastard and
be done with it,
Brad nods as noncommittally as he can.
A moment, In the silence, a familiar tune plays softly on the van’s
stereo system.
_ BRAD
You @ Raffi fan?
LARRY

(startled)
What?

; _ BRAD
That‘s Raffi, right? Big, Beautiful
Planet?

LARRY
Ah, shit,

Larry punches the eject.

After a while I don‘t even know what Im
Listening to anymore.

Larry Stares at Brad, a lingering appraisal.

Brad tries to ignore how uncomfortable this feels.
LARRY

You look good, Been going to the gym?
BRAD

Push-ups, crunches. A little running.

LARRY
(to himself} .
The guys are gonna love this.

_, BRAD,
(a bit anxious)
What guys?

EXT. EAST WYNDAM BOMBERS’ FIELD ~ NIGHT

Brad and Larry head across a running track, passing A SURLY-LOOKING
GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR. This is BULLHORN BOB, a fixture at the stadium.

Brad pauses at the edge of the field, a taut blue-green skin of
ARTIFICIAL TURF glowing with Caribbean purity beneath dazzling
lights. Crisp TE LINES and NUMBERS run from one end zone to the
other. Between the forty yard lines, a half-dozen men toss FOOTBALLS
to each other, and do warm-ups.

_,. BRAD
Wow. This is something.

LARRY
It’s pretty. But it doesn’t have a lot
of give. Like playing on cement.

They approach midfield, Some players strut up to geeet then ~ TOMMY
CORRENTI, a drill~sergeant of a man, with an off-kilter nose, and A
COMICALLY NASAL VOICE, DEWAYNE ROGERS, a squat, bald African~
American man, BART WILLIAMS, a no-neck white with thinning hair
wearing a KNEE BRACE, RICRIE MURPHY, a powerful man with red hair,
and PETE OLAFFSON, a scrawny man whose uniform is intentionally one
size too small.

Larry steps away from Brad and button~holes DeWayne, corralling him
away from the others. :

LARRY
Hey, DeWayne, I really need to talk to
you about the committee. It'd mean a lot
to have your support on this thing.

DEWAYNE
I told yon already Larry. None of us are
ionna get involved with that shit -~ we're
here to play ball. If that's your thing,
fine But leave us out of it man. We
can’t ~

LARRY .
{cutting him off, pissed}
T get it, I get it.

Larry makes a piercing whistle. The guys ail turn toward him.

_  ., GARRY .
Bring it in. C'mon, hustle it up.
The men all gather around Larry.
LARRY
Guys, I want you all to meet our new
quarterback,
Looking slightly out of place in his cargo shorts and polo shirt,
Brad stares at Larry in bewilderment.
BRAD
Quarterback?
CORRENTE
He better not be a pussy.

_ LARRY
He played in college.

. BRAD
I’m a little behind the curve, Who are
you guys?
LARRY
We're The Guardians.
DEWAYNE
We're cops.

PETE

Night League.

BART
Our old quarterback’s wife made him quit.
foo many concussions.
Brad’s glance strays to Bullhorn Bob, who stares back from his
wheelchair.
BRAD
I thought you said it was touch.
The Guardians laugh knowlagly.
CORRENTE
It's tackle. We just call it touch for
insurance purposes.
LARRY

Why don't we work on some simple pass
patterns?
a2

Brad hesitates.

VOICE
Brad waited for his good sense to kick
in. There were lots of excuses available
to him.
He takes in his surroundings, and the faces of the other men.
VOICE .
But it felt so good to be standing here
beneath the bright lights, And he was
filled with a feeling similar to the one
he'd had right before kissing Sarah, like
his world had cracked open to reveal a
thrilling new possibility.

His face fills with certainty.

. BRAD .
Alright. Just let me warm up a little.
CUT TO: IMAGE OF BRAD TAKING THE SNAP AT PRACTICE.
He drops back to pass, and zips a bullet to DeWayne, totally
oblivious as Correnti enters from his blind side and smashes him to
the turf with a VICIOUS CHEAP SHOT. Brad bounces up, angry and
confused, to confront his attacker.
BRAD |
What the fuck? That was a late hit.

Larry's van pulls up in front of a well-tended Cape.
. BRAD
This isn’t me. You turned too soon. I'm
on Ashforth.

Larry doesn’t answer, He just stares out the window at the house.

BRAD
What're we doing here?

Larry presses on his horn three times, Brad startles to attention.

BRAD
Why'd you do that?

LARRY
I want this scumbag to know I'm keeping
an eye on hin.

reey sit for a long moment. Ii suddenly dawns on Brad whose house

BRAD
Oh, God...2 don’t think we wanna be here,
Larry.

LARRY
It's not a question of want.

Larry reaches inte the back seat for his BINOCULARS and trains them
on the house.

LARRY
Joanie thinks I’m obsessed with this
cresp. She thinks if I hada jobI
wouldn’t be driving past his house five,
six times a day. But you know what? I
kinda feel like this is my job.

Larry puts down the binoculars and turns to Brad.
LARRY .
There‘s a roll of duct-tape in the glove
compartment. Could you grab it for me?
INT. BRAD’S HOUSE, HALLWAY — NIGHT

Brad closes the front door removes his shoes, and makes his way on

You remember parry Hedges from the |
sprinkler park? The guy with the twins?
It's his organization.

ATHY
T thought you didn’t like him.

BRAD
He’s okay. But this committee makes a lot
of sense. It’s pretty scary having a gu
like that living right by the playground.

Kathy gazes lovingly at Aaron.

RATHY
I know. I hate to even think about it.

She looks back up at her husband.

RATHY
Well, you better take a shower.
INT. BRAD'S BATHROOM ~ NIGHT
Brad’s in the shower, frantically soaping himself.

EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE — DAY
A formidable colonial on a hilly double lot.

Number two Hillcrest was an impressive
piece of real estate.

INT. SARAR‘S HOUSE, VARIOUS EMPTY ROOMS — SAME

Space and windows. A beautiful floor plan, somewhat grand. Looking
around you will netice a kind of dead beauty to the place, All
dressed up and no place to go.

VOICE
Even so, Sarah was ambivalent about the house
that she occupied, She wasn’t involved with
it’s purchase or design, The place was a hand-
me-down of sorts trom Richard’s mother, and
the furnishings were left-overs from his first
marriage.

INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS ATTIC UTILITY ROOM — SAME

A small dark narrow space with a single window at the end. An old
MATTRESS & BOX SPRINGS rest against the wall.

VOICE
By the time Sarah arrived here, Richard
wasn't all that interested in
redecorating. And so she decided to leave
it as it was...

A YOUNGER and VERY PREGNANT SARAH sorts through a gaggle of movin
boxes adorned with her name. She lifts out stack after stack of BOOKS.

Sarah, wearing reading glasses, sits at a writing table situated
directly under a window, transcribing passages from Working With
Feminist Criticism by Mary Eagleton. S: es notes into a MT.
TOM 6X4 NOTEBOOK from BOB SLATE.

Lucy, carrying her own book, wanders over and stares up at her
mother, Sarah is oblivious.

Lucy

In a minute.

Lucy pulls at Sarah's notebook.

. LUCY
I sit on your lap.

Sarah pulis back.
~ 3B

i said in a minute. Now go on, finish
your program. Go.

The child retreats. Sarah returns to her studies.

VOICE
From the moment Lucy was born, Sarah had
refused to hire someone for child care,
She wasn’t exactly sure why she had taken
this stance. The truth was she spent most
afternoons marking time...

Sarah glances impatiently at her watch.
She spots a toy left behind by Lucy ~ She rises from the writin
table, bends down to pick up the item, moves to the doorway, and
places it on a side-table outside the room. She steps back into her
study, and closes the door.

could finally have a moment to herself.
But even this was not something she could

Sarah opens the door to reveal JEAN, a vigorous 60 year-old woman,
pumping her arms and legs on the front stoop.
JEAN
Ready to roll?

SARAH
Could you wait a few minutes? Richard’s
barricaded in the upstairs office
finishing up some stuff for work.

JEAN
No problem. I have a little surprise for
someone anyway.

Sarah closes the front door.

INT. SARAH'S FRONT ZNTRY WAY — CONTINUOUS

Jean cups her hands around her mouth.

Hellooo? Is there a cute little girl in
the house?

LUCY runs in from the other room, jumps up and throws herself into
the older woman‘s arms as if they're lovers meeting in an airport.

Jean rotates her JUMBO FANNY PACK and tugs slowly on the zipper.

JEAN
Oh my goodness. Look what I found.

With the flair of a magician, Jean produces a TINY STUFFED DOG from
the pouch and hands it to an awestruck Lucy.

Lucy
A Beaniel

SARAR
Jean, you didn’t have to do that.

. JEAN

This dog needed a little girl to take
care of him. And I knew a little girl who
needed a dog.

LUCY
Thank you, Jean.

INT. SARAH'S STUDY ~ LATER (MAGIC)

Sarah sits at her writing table, her impatience growing by the second.
LUCY & JEAN play in the next room at the kitchen table. Sarah extends
her leg, and gently closes the door, She turns and We MOVE IN on her
annoyed face -

VOICE
Sarah was beginning to get angry. Her
evening fitness walk wag the one thing
she looked forward to all day, and
Richard knew this. She didn’t care how
busy he was, it was a simple matter of

equity.
INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS OFFICE — SAME
A SILVER-FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Sarah and Lucy rests on a desk.

A distinguished looking MAN in his mid-forties sits behind the desk,
focusing on the COMPU’ SCREEN in front of hin.

If there was one thing life had taught
Richard, it was that it was ridiculous to
be at war with your own desires,

RICHARD ms his desk drawer and removes a small rectangular Ups
shipping box,

gay if they could see him now...
With trembling hands, he breaks the seal on the box, and withdraws a
MANILA ENVELOPE decorated with STICKERS, RED HEARTS and STARS.

VOICE .

someone had told them that Ray...

Richard glances at A BOX that appears over HIS RIGHT SHOULDER. In it
— RAY, aman in his 30s, dressed in sweats, under~hands a bali to his
son who swings for a hit.

Blone now, in Ray’s imagined bedroom, he gazes into a MIRROR applying LIP-

gay sex at highway rest stops.
Richard glances at A NEW BOX that appears over HIS LEFT SHOULDER. In
it — another man, TED, stands at a bank of URINALS, he gives a side-
long glance to a SKINNY MAN using the next one over.
As Richard looks back down at the envelope in his hands the BOXES
disappear. Richard takes out a LETTER OPENER and slices through the
packing tape on the envelope.
VOICE .
But we want what we want, Richard
thought, and there's not much we can do
about it.
Before removing the contents of the envelope, Richard takes the
photograph of his wife and daughter and turns it face down on the
Sk.
INT. RICHARD'S PLACE OF BUSINESS — DAY -- ELEVEN MONTHS AGO

VOICE
He had stumbled on the site eleven months
ago, while doing research for a
consulting firm.

A SQUARE ROOM with dozens of MANNED CUBICLES, through the maze on the
other side of the place is -

A 600 square-foot office with a window, where —
RICHARD sits at his desk, his attention focused on his FLAT-SCREEN,

VOICE
His office door was wide open.

Richard glances up from the monitor furtively.
He takes a breath, and his eyes go hack to the monitor.

His HAND holding the MOUSE hovers with anticigation.
33

VOICE
But he clicked on the link anyway.

ON the MONITOR is the HOMEPAGE of SLUTTY KAY, a BLONDE WOMAN, in her
thirties. There’s something graphicaily homegrown about the design.
It looks authentic, and not put together by a consortium in Glendale.
in large friendly quotes it says “actively pursuing a swinging
lifestyle, and my God-given sexuality.”
His hand moves the mouse. The cursor clicks on Read More About Me. A
long Q 6A appears next to a new image of Kay bending over a table.
She wears a SHORT TARTAN SKIRT with NO PANTIES.
VOICE oe as
He was deeply engrossed in his discovery
when Ted knocked on his door...

TED, Richard's imagined REST STOP CRUISER stands in the doorway.

VOICE

Richard looks up.

VOICE
Casually, but with great haste,
Richard’s hand invisibly moves his mouse.

Richard banished Slutty Kay from his
screen...
Kay’s homepage collapses, the monitor now shows a spread sheet of
another kind.

Caesar...
Ted nods, and departs.

INT. RICHARD’S PLACE OF BUSINESS — NIGHT — SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
The overhead lights are off for the night. The only illumination iz
eke place emanating from an office on the other side of the room,
where ~

RICHARD sits at his desk, shuffling papers, pretending to be busy. A
middle-aged SECRETARY pokes her head inte the room,

SECRETARY
Do you need me for anything else?

RICHARD
No, why don’t you head home? I'm gonna
catch up on some e-mail.

SECRETARY ;
Well, don’t stay too late. Your dinner‘1l
get cold,

Richard smiles and waves goodbye. He lets a couple of seconds pass,
then gets up and locks his office door.

Richard returns to his desk, his attention now refocused on his flat-
screen.

VOICE
Lately, Slutty Kay had become a problem.

The cursor highlights a BOOKMARK in his preferences entitled —
Slutty Kay positions & implements.

VOICE
He thought about her far too often, and
Spent hours studying the thousands of
photographs available to him.

Richard’s CURSOR flies across the SCREEN and launches his BROWSER.

Kay appears in various positions, outfits, and as the bookmark title
indicated, utilizing all kinds of implements.

VOICE _ .
Some of Kay‘’s practices struck him as
bizarre, even off-putting, She had a
thing about kitchen utensils, spatulas,
barbecue forks, and dressing up like a
little girl and playing with balloons.
But who was Richard to judge?

He pulls a box of KLEENEX from the BOTTOM DRAWER, and licks his lips.
iis eyes dreamy, and hungry. He pulls down his trousers and gets down
to business.

VOICE
Though, as close as Richard sometimes
felt to Slutty Kay — as much as he
believed that he knew her...

Richard keeps yanking, a desperate impatience on his face.
VOICE
-«-he could never get past the
uncomfortable fact that she existed for
him solely as a digital image.

He looks down at his lap, Things don’t seem to he going well.

INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS OFFICE - BACK TO PRESENT — MAGIC

CLOSE ON: Richard's HANDS as they remove the contents of the HEART-

POLKA DOP THONG in various poses. Each of them bear the greeting,
scrawled in black sharpie, Hi Richard!

_. oIck .
The panties were an attempt to solve this
problem.

His HANDS reach back in and pall out the actual THONG in the photos.
He raises it a gouple of inches from his face, tentatively giving it
his nasal appraisal.

VOICE
Maybe a sniff or two would hurry things
along, so he could get back downstairs to
his real life...

He reaches down with his other hand, and jerks off.

VOICE
++, where his wife and daughter were
waiting for him, their impatience
increasing by the minute.

SARAH stands at the bottom of the Stairway staring up. Her patience
at an end. She hesitates just a moment before making the long climb.

Unaware that she is about to play her own version of Aaron’s Train
LeCK.

She arrives outside the office door, and gives a tentative knock.
No answer. She reaches down and turns the knob. The door swings open
to -

RICHARD jerking. He now wears the polka dot thong like a gas mask:
over his mouth and nose. Inhaling its scent with gusto.

SARAH peers inside. Her expression wavering between revulsion and
amazement, Richard is oblivious.

SARA
Ahen.

Richard whips his head around, the thong still pressed over the lower
half of his face. He scrambles to hide the evidence.

, SARAH
Is this going to take much longer? I’d
really like to go for my walk.

Sarah snaps out of it.
What? Yeah.
JEAN .
You'll have to walk without me tomorrow

SARAH
Okay.

Silence. Then.

JEAN .
You're sure everything’s alright?

SARAH .
Yeah, sorry, I guess I'm just a little
tired... 80, what are you reading?

Crime and Punishment.

SARAH
Wow, That‘s pretty highbrow for a book
group.

They turn the final corner onto their own street.

JEAN
We have some very stimulating
discussions. You should come next month.
We're doing Madame Bovary. You could be
my little Sister.

. SARAH
Little sister?

JEAN
We're trying to get younger women
involved. We call them our little
sisters.

SARAH .
I don't know, I read Madame Bovary in
grad school, It’s a pretty misogynist
text.

Sarah slows, squinting at a shadowy figure on her front steps.
JEAN
Well, that’s an interesting perspective.
You should come.

SARAH
Excuse me, Jean. Someone’s at my door.
T’1i call you.

Sarah hurries off, leaving Jean behind in the street.

THERESA from the playground sits on Sarah's front steps, smoking a
cigarette. She smiles stiffly as Sarah approaches.

Sarah stops at the base of the steps.

SARAR
a bit flustered)
Well, this is a surprise. I haven’t seen
you since...

THERESA
I hope you don’t mind. Your husband said
you'd be back any minute.

Not at ali.

she smiles at Theresa.

SARAHB
It’s good to see you. Can I make you a
cup of tea or something?

THERESA :
T can only stay a minute. I just wanted
to warn you. You know that guy? The
pervert? He's been riding his bike near
the playground, checking out the kids.

SARAB
Oh, God. Do the police know?

THERESA ;
Nothing they can do. He’s not breaking —
any laws. I guess they’re waiting for him
to kill someone. I just thought you
should know.

SARAH
Thanks. That’s nice of zou.
(then, plaintively)
You sure you don’t want some tea?

THERESA
I'm sorry.

Theresa stands up,

(after a beat)
I didn’t mean to kiss him. I don’t even
know how it happened.
She pats Sarah gently on the am.

THERESA
I better go. Mike’s gonna worry.

She leaves Sarah standing there alone. Sarah turns and stares at the
front door, stealing herself for what she knows is waiting for her on
the other side. She lets out a groan, reaches for the doorknob and
heads into -
INT. SARAH’S HOUSE, FOYER — SAME
The front entry-way, where Richard stands wearing a hangdo expression.
He stares at her pathetically, like a child waiting to ‘orgiven.
RICHARD
«.-you want to talk?

Sarah brushes past him and heads upstairs.

I'm tired.

Richard looks both disappointed and relieved.
INT. SARAH’S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY — MORNING

Sarah peeks into Lucy’s room. The child is still asleep. THE SOUND OF
A CAR STARTING brings Sarah over to the window at the top of the
stairs. She looks down at —

THE DRIVEWAY
To see Richard’s car pulling away, on his way to work.
UPSTAIRS OFFICE

Sarah closes the door to Richard’s office, moves over to the window,
pulls up the shade, and scans the room. She moves over to the desk,
and begins to investigate - looking at paperwork, rifling drawers,
and examining computer disks. She glances down at a smal] WASTEBASKET
topped with WADDED UP TISSUES. She grimaces, disgusted.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM ~ SAME

Brad sits at the dining room table going through credit card bills
from five different companies, A YELLOW POST IT is attached to the
outside of one of the envelopes. In a neat feminine cursive is
scrawled “Brad! Please look this over.” His hands obey, and puli out
an itemized report, that has multiple items highlighted Sports
illustrated, Men's Fitness, and hothering Magazine, In the margins
the same cursive asks “Do you really need these?” The phone rings,
and Brad answers it.
BRAD
Hello? No, he’s still sleeping... yeah,
i'm going through them now...No, I quess
I don’t need them...alright have a good —

She's already hung up. Brad hangs up, closes his eyes, and steels
himself. He looks utterly defeated.

SARAH'S STUDY — MOMENTS LATER

AN UNTOUCHED MUG OF TEA on the writing table in front of her, Sarah
sits there with a thousand mile stare on her face, Finally, she picks
up her notebook, and book of essays on Feminist Criticism, and tries
to get interested. It’s no use. She sets them down abruptly, and
moves over to ~

A SIDE-TABLE stacked with periodicals. She rifles through and
discards: Ad Busters, Mother Jones, The Utne Reader, The Paris
Review, before finding the object of her desire — the latest
catalogue from J-CREW.

She moves to an old HIGH-BACK CHAIR with her prize, and starts
browsing the pages. She takes a huge gulp of tea, her left hand
absently reaches for the television remote, and turns on the set.

An infomercial for Nature-Bra preaches "the Joys of perk breasts.”
Sarah focuses on a J-CREW Model clad in a NE PIECE BATHING
SUIT, as the seductive spokeswoman for Nature-Bra points out the
possible benefits of using this product “post breast feeding.” Sarah
urns her attention from the catalogue to the screen, just in time
to “learn how to order.”

EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE ~ MORNING
A FED-EX TRUCK pulls away after making it’s appointed rounds.
INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN TABLE ~ DAY

A KITCHEN KNIFE rips through a CARDBOARD BOX past a shipping label
from J-CREW.

EXT. TOWN POOL — DAY

Wearing an unbuttoned MEN’S SHIRT over her BATHING SUIT, Sarah peers
through a CHAIN-LINR FENCE, Lucy at her side.

An enormous rectangle of water framed by a CONCRETE WALKWAY, set at
the bottom of a grassy hill.

A SLY SMILE OF RECOGNITION passes across Sarah’s face.
In the middle-distance BRAD AND AARON SIT SHADED BY A TREE.

Sarah flashes her ID at a BORED-LOOKING TEENAGER reading a Stephen
King novel. The kid waves them in. Sarah takes Lucy straight to

THE WADING POOL. She attaches a pair of INFLATABLE WATER-WINGS to
iucy’s arms, and sits her on the edge of the pool. She sneaks a
glance up the hill toward Brad & Aaron’s tree, hoping to catch a
certain someone’s eye. She does.

BRAD, shirtless, sits on a beach towel in a patch of shade. He looks
in her direction. Then looks away quickly.
~49—

SARAE sets LUCY into the WADING POOL, and makes a show of playing
with her daughter, throwing the occasional glance up the hill to make
sure he's still there -

He is, pretending to read a magazine.. Aaron in his JESTER’S CaP,
stages collisions with TOY TRUCKS. But the boy grows bored and
teddles over to his father, pulling on Brad’s arm.

ARRON
Daddy. I go in pool now.

Brad‘s not sure he’s ready for that.

«ein a minute.

AARON
Daddy, now!

IN THE WADING POOL, Sarah watches Lucy, but she's clearly distracted.
She steals another look,

LUCY
Mommy? I havta to go pee pee.
SARAH
Just go in the pool.
Lucy shakes her head no.

SARAH
Really? Okay, ¢’mon.
She grabs Lucy, and they head to the LADIES'S LOCKER ROOM,

UNDER THE TREE, Brad sees his chance to avoid an encounter, and
satisfy Aaron at the same time. He stands, picks up his son, and
heads down the hill toward the pool.

IN THE WADING POOL, Brad & Aaron roughhouse and play. Brad is more
engaged with his child, but like Sarah, he can't help wishing he had
eyes in the back of his head. He keeps scanning the area, on the
lookout for her. His eyes fixate on the LADIES'S LOCKER ROOM DOOR.
Women and children come and go, but no Sarah or Lucy.

Finally Brad begins to relax, allowing himself to become completely
absorbed in play.

LATER
Brad and Aaron squint into the sun as they trudge up the hill toward
their tree. It’s not until they have almost reached the shady place
that they discover —
SARAH & LUCY spread out on towels right next to their own.
SARAE |
(mock surprise}
Oh my God, it’s you.

Brad stares at her, somewhat surprised, and worried at the same time.

BRAD
How. Hey.

Sarah removes a BOTTLE OF SUNSCREEN from a bag. She squeezes a gob of
it inte her hand and begins slathering it all over Lucy, who 5) its
like a good soldier. She turns to Brad.

SARAH - .
I hope you don’t mind. Lucy has sensitive
skin, She’s better off in the shade.

__ BRAD
{polite} . .
Not at all. It’s nice te see you again.

He sets Aaron down on their blanket, and begins drying the boy off.

After finishing with Lucy, Sarah removes the MEN'S SHIRT; revealing
her RED ONE PIECE. She begins to rub lotion on her arms.

SARAH
{casually)
I'm sorry, could you get my back?

Brad turns around.

BRAD
.. etm, okay, sure.

He squirts lotion into his hand and begins RUBBING IT INTO HER BACK
in a POLITE and BUSINESSLIKE MANNER. Sarah closes her eyes and leans
back into the massage. After a few seconds, she smiles over her
shoulder.

SARAH
Thanks alot. Lucy? Say hi to the little
boy from the playground.

. LUCY

. ARRON
Hi.

Sarah waves back triumphantly.

VOICE
It was the most fun Sarah had had in
years.

Fresh from the pool, Brad leans back and soaks up the sun, his body

glistening with luminous droplets of water.

Sarah devours him with her eyes.

VOICE
But there was always that longing to
touch, to be touched by Brad. And as |
badly as she wanted this, she wanted just
as badly. to hold on to the innocent
public life they'd made for themselves
out in the open, with the other parents
and children.

One more happy day at the pool.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, KITCHEN — MORNING
Aaron sits in his highchair shovelling oatmeal into his mouth. Kath
marks up some copy with a red pen as she finishes with her breakfast.

Brad watches the two of them, waiting to be noticed or acknowledged
in some way, shape, or form, Finally, Kathy speaks.

KATHY
No pasta for dinner, okay? We eat way too
mach pasta around here.

BRAD
I thought you liked pasta.

KATHY
I do. That's the problem. Pretty soon
I’ll be able to séli advertising space on

She rises, gathers up paperwork and the breakfast plates.

BRAD
What is that?

BRAD .

I thought you were already editing.
She carries the dishes over to the sink.

KATHY
So did I. But this family’s story just
got me... the father was killed ina
mortar attack on his base. Left behind a
a little boy, and a baby girl.

She starts rinsing plates.

KATEY
I spoke with his wife on the phone
yesterday... said she didn’t know what
she was gonna do next Christmas.

Oh jeez, I bet.

She shakes her head.

KATHY

_ (reflective)
No, it wasn't like that. It was more
wondering if she should keep a tradition
with her son that she began with the boy's
father... said her husband had had a knack
for requesting odd Christmas gifts. A scuba

next.,.said he wasn't afraid to try

anything.
Over Brad's face ~ THE NOON BELLS TOLL FROM ST. PAUL’S TOWER.
EXT. TOWN POOL — DAY
It’s hot, humid, and horrible. The children sit together on a towel
occupied with their play. Sarah lies on her back BRAD’S T-SHIRT over
her face.
Brad allows himself the pleasure of pouring his eyes over Sarah's
body completely unobserved. Then —

SARAH

Hot enough for you?
For a moment, Brad thinks he’s been caught, but then he realizes it's
an innocent enough question.

BRAD
»ssyeah, it's so humid, I got Football
practice tonight. Be like playing in a
sauna.

SARAH
Watch out for that Italian guy. What's
his name again?

BRAD
Correnti?

Brad smiles, pleased that she’s taken an interest, and has even gone
so far as to remember something he only mentioned in passing.

SARAH
Yeah. Remember what happened to your knee
last week?

She lays the back of her hand surreptitiously on his chest.

SARAH
You should be careful, Brad.

He stares at her hand just as she moves it away.

‘ll be careful.

Promise?

__ BRAD
{smiles}
Yeah. Yeah, I promise

A moment passes between them.
Brad breaks it by talking about - what else? The weather.
BRAD
{looks at the sky}

Weatherman said scattered showers, I

don’t see any scattered showers.
A man in LOUD SWIM TRUNKS, with an ORANGE DIVING MASK on his forehead
and a SCUBA FLIPPER in each hand, stands by the lifeguard chair. He
scans his surroundings. He is —
The face from the flyers, RONNIE MCGORVEY.
McGorvey drops his towel and begins putting on his flippers.
He lowers his mask, slides feet-first into the i, and begins
exploring — participating in water play, and taking in the general
scenery.

SARAH props her self up and reaches for her book. It is at precisely
this moment that she sees him.

Oh my God.

BRAD
What?

. SARAE

It's him.
. oa
{squinting

Oh, Jesus.

At first, no one else seems to notice his presence in the water.
BEACH BALLS float through the air. Kids keep CANNONBALLING and BELLY-
FLOPPING off the diving board.

But then, not far from Brad and Sarah on the hill, an EXTREMELY
AGITATED WOMAN stands up, and shouts,

AGITATED WOMAN
Jimny! Jimmy Mancino! Out of the pool
this instant!

3 SKINNY TEN-YEAR-OLD starts paddling. uncertainty toward the edge of
the pool.

The SHALLOW END empties first, ANXIOUS MOTHERS wading out with

FRIGHTENED TODDLERS in their arms. Before long, the OLDER KIDS are
climbing ovt, too, standing in sullen confusion on the walkway.

All over the hillside, adults are whipping out MOBILE PHONES, dialing

UNDERWATER - Ronnie McGorvey plunges toward the bottom of the deep
end with the heavy grace of a seal. He rises slowly -

Breaking the SURFACE to find himself alone in the pool.
Ronnie’s EYES dart around inside his MASK, absorbing the situation.

He ducks BACK UNDER, cutting through the water, moving his arms in
wide lazy circles. He looks peaceful, unhurried.

He FLOATS on his BACK for a while, his pale belly rising out of the
water like a deserted island.

MINUTES LATER

TWO COPS enter the pool area and approach McGorvey. Aaron and Lucy
have taken notice, too.

_ ley
Why the police is here?
Sarah checks with Brad, uncertain.

: SARAH
There’s a man in the pool that didn’t buy
a ticket to get in, and the police are
asking him to leave.

The cops speak to lcGorvey. The exchange seems polite, almost
friendly. After a moment, one cop reaches down and gives him a hand
getting out of the water.

AARON
What's those? On the feet?

. BRAD
Flippers. They help you swim better.

McGorvey grabs his towel, and begins trudging toward the exit, his
flippers slapping wetly on the ground. He stops to pull them off,
then strips off the mask, turning toward the hillside. Be spreads his
ams wide, addressing the public in a loud voice.

MCGORVEY
E was only trying to cool off:
EXT. TOWN POOL — LATER

Tt seems like the whole town has crowded into the pool, the DECENT
PEOPLE OF East Wyndam reclaiming it for their own.

The COLLECTIVE FUNK has broken. Adults get inte giggly splashing
fights. Everybody tries to keep a beach ball aloft.

THE SUN BEGINS TO DISAPPEAR BEHIND A CLOUD.
The DISTANT RUMBLE of THUNDER. The sky goes DARK. It begins to SHOWER,

it seems like good fun until the LIGHTNING FLASH. A LIFEGUARD speaks
through a LOUDSPEAKER.

LIFEGUARD (0.C.}
Clear the pool, please.

The rain intensifies as Sarah and Brad gather their things.

A SAVAGE CRACK OF THUNDER SOUNDS. Lucy whimpers and latches onto
Sarah’s leg. Sarah lifts her up.

SARAH
We better get going.

BRAD
You're gonna carry her?

SARAH
It'll be faster,

BRAD .
That’s crazy. Put her in the stroller.
Sarah glances at the stroller. BIG BEAR stares back.

SARAH
She won't do the stroller.

BRAD
Hey, Lucy? Want a ride?

Lucy unlatches from Sarah's leg and runs right into Brad‘s arms, and
he Sets her up in the thing.

Sarah is both impressed, and envious.

But it’s out of your way.

We don’t mind, do we, Aaron?

SARAH
Okay, Then run, quick.

EXT. SARAH'S STREET — LATER

Brad pushes the double stroller at a fast clip. Sarah, carrying Big
Bear in her arms, leads him toward her house.

EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE (SUN ROOH) ~ SAME

Sarah kneels down to unbuckle Lucy. Both kids SLEEF LIKE ANGELS,
Lucy’s head lolling on Aaron's shoulder.

Sarah hesitates, uncertain whether to invite Brad in, This AWKWARD
MOMENT is interrupted by a CLOSE LIGHTNING FLASH.
SARAB
You better come in. I can’t let you walk
home in this.
INT. SARAH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM, STAIRS ~ SAME
The two enter with the kids in tow. Sarah heads straight in, Brad a
few paces behind, takes in the place: Expensive, tasteful, and a
couple of notches up the food chain from what he is used to. Sarah
heads upstairs carrying Lucy.
SARAB
We can lie them down in Lucy’s room.

BRAD
Okay.

He follows her up the stairway.

Brad waits on the stairs as Sarah secures the BABY GATE.

Sarah & Brad head down the final stairs, and into the liviag room.

The safety of the public arena removed, makes keeping each other's
company clumsy.

Brad laughs, and pulls at his soaked clothing.

SARAH

Right. I'll just put the children’s
things in the dryer, and get us some
towels.

She heads out of the room quickly, leaving Brad alone.

He looks off the main entry way to a succession of small rooms, an
open door leads to the first room situated behind a back staircase,
clearly what was at one time quarters for a maid. He steps inside.
Nothing much to see. On the other side of the room is another door,
gH htly ajar. He wanders in that direction, and opens the door,

SARAH‘S STUDY

ue steps into the room, and takes a quick inventory of the place, her
place.

He moves toward her old high-back, and pushes a finger into one of
the many holes in its torn fabric.

One of SARAH'S SCARVES is draped across the top of the chair, He
places bis palm underneath the garment —- the material cascading over
nis hand.

At the base of a VASE full of FRESH FLOWERS lie Sarah’s READING

fhe tips of his fingers glide across her writing Kable; past Theresa
Raguin, to a book of English Love Sonnets. The K opens easily,
marked by an, ag yet, not fully dry rose, pressed against an off read

iece: Sonnet 147 by William Shakespeare. Specific Lines appear to
have been recently underlined:

My Love is as a fever, The uncertain sickly appetite to please,
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, Past cure am I.

He turns the page to find a tucked-in SNAP-SHOT of BRAD, AARON, and
LUCY at the town pool.

The book snaps shut.

He puts it back down on the table, like it may burn his hand.

His face a mess of conflicting emotions.

LAUNDRY ROOM ~ SAME

Sarah empties dry bedding and towels from a FRONT LOADER into an empty
laundry basket. She grabs the children’s wet things, throws them into
the dryer and starts the cycle. She moves the basket to a folding
table on the other side of the small basement room, pulls out two
towels and begins folding them into thirds.

Slowly, A SHADOW begins to grow across her back —

Brad’s shoulder, and head appear.

He raises his hand, about to place it on her arm, when suddenly she
turns, coming face-to-face with him. Startled, she gasps.

She looks genuinely frightened. What is he doing down here?

The two of them just stare at each other — both appear unable to move.
Finally, she lifts up the two towels she has folded, and offers one io
him, there is something oddly formal about her gesture.

He takes the towel from her hand and drops it to the floor. She
somewhat timidly drops the other one.

He pulls her into him, and begins toe kiss her, gentle, then forceful.

Her eyes dart all over the place. Then instinct kick in, and she
surrenders to the moment. The kiss becomes completel electrifying,
the kind of kiss that would make perfect sense outside a dorm room at
two in the morning. Their hands find each other for the first time,
all bets are off — the play is real.

LAUNDRY ROOM — MOMENTS LATER

SQUAUK — The dryer announces that it bas reached the end of its
cycle, However, the silence is short-lived. Grateful moans accompany
the view of Sarah perched on the edge of a STONE SOAP SINK, gripping
Brad‘s backside as he thrusts himself into her.

Brad picks up the pace. They’ve reached a level of near-frenzy, when
Brad SUDDENLY STOPS.
BRAD
Do you feel guilty about this?

Sarah thinks this over.
SARAR
No. I don’t.
BRAD
Ido. I feel really bad.
Sarah grimaces, steeling herself for disappointment. But the
deliberate motion of Brad’s body betray his words, putting her
mind at ease, and her body on high alert. She begins to vocalize
uncontrollably. The laundry room door is slightly open, and she
looks toward the ~

through the sections until she finds what she’s after.

That someone is —

MAY, who sits in a swivel BARCALOUNGER with a folded NEWSPAPER on
her lap, a PAD and PENCIL in her hands. She stares across the room
to where Ronnie sits sipping coffee from a mug, and reading Soldier
of Fortune Magazine.

MAY
There are two whole columns of lonely
women here, and only a handful of men.
The odds are on our side. Why wouldn’t
one of these women want to meet a nice

RONNIE
I’m not a nice person.

You did a bad thing. But that doesn’t
mean you're a bad person.

RONNIE

With the exception of two players, the entire Guardian team sits
front and center at a table in the middle of the place. They turn in

unison as Brad § Larry make an entrance through the front deor of the
establishment. Larry looks like shit.

VOICE
Although the Guardians lost by 26 points,
Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar

DEWAYNE

OLAFFSON

WILLIAMS grabs a shot glass from a cork-lined tray in the center of
the table, and offers it to Brad.

Dr. Daniels. His frierids call him Jack.
Williams pours Brad a shot of Bourbon. Brad raises his glass.

BRAD
To the good Doctor,

He throws back the shot.

BRAD
I feel better already.

INT/EXT. LARRY’S VAN ~ MOVING ~ LATER

Brad stares over at an uncharacteristically silent Larry, who holds
an ice-~bag to his eye while driving. Finally -

LARRY
I had no business being out on that field
tonight. I let you down. I let the whole
team down. I'm Slow and I'm fat and I let
those guys piss all over me.

BRAD .
Oh, come on. That guy was off~sides the

LARRY .
Joanie left me. Took the kids and went to

BRAD
Jesus, Larry. That‘s a tough break.

TARRY
I deserved it. Me and my big mouth, I
called her a fucking whore. Right in
front of the kids.

BRAD
Why did you do that?

LARRY
I don’t know. I was in a bad mood or
something? Now I’m fucked.

Brad watches his friend - worried. He tries changing the subject.

BRAD
Hey, you hear about the pervert? He went
swimming at the Town Pool.

LARRY

Larry whips his head in Brad’s direction, turning his attention
completely away from the road.

The cops came.

LARRY

Any of the guys from the team?

BRAD

Larry starts shaking his head and muttering to himself, as if
something were very, very wrong.

Brad looks like he wishes he hadn’t brought it up.

Larry STEPS ON THE GAS.

BRAD
Larry, slow down. SLOW DOWN LARRY!

Larry SPINS THE WHEEL HARD to the LEFT, pulling a cop-show U-turn, The
van does an about-face and SPEEDS STRAIGHT TOWARD US.

A BYPERACTIVE DOORBELL RINGS OVER ~-
INT/EXT. MCGORVEY HOUSE, FRONT DOOR — LATER

May answers the door after the fifth ring. She doesn’t seem surprised
to find two men — one of them with a bruised and puffy eye, the other
with a bag of ice pressed against his cheek ~ standing on her front
stoop at two thirty in the morning.

MAY

What now?

LARRY
Good evening, Mrs. McGorvey. We were
wondering if Ronnie was home.

This is my house. I pay the mortgage, and

Larry cups his hands around his mouth.

LARRY

Yoo hoo, Ronnie! Get your perverted ass
down here!

May steps back inside and tries to slam the door, but Larry catches
it with his foot, and kicks it open even wider.

MAY
I’m calling the police.

LARRY
I hear they’re well-disposed to child
molesters.

All the air goes out of the woman. RONNIE himself appears in the
hallway behind her, blinking and bewildered, clad in pajamas.

RONNIE
It’s okay, Mommy.

He gently insinuates himself between his mother and the men,

RONNIE
Can I help you gentlemen?

Larry takes an aggressive step toward Ronnie, but May’s maternal
instinct kicks in, and she steps in front of her son.

MAY
_ (a demand}
Ronnie, you go on upstairs.

He recedes back into the house.

RONNIE
{like a three-year-old)
Alright, Mommy.

Brad grabs Larry's arms and tries to restrain him.

BRAD
Cone on, Larry. Let's go home, I think he
gets the point.

LARRY
You listen to me, you piece of shit. You
stay the fuck away from the Town Pool,
you hear me? Or I will personally fix it
sc that you no longer have a dick to show
anyone, is that clear?

ERY

following directly to Brad.

Hy Ronnie would never do anything like

He did.

Larry looks scared for the first time.
MAY

What you did to him.

It’s his turn to have the wind knocked out of him, May steps back
inside the house, and closes the door with no resistance.

INT. LARRY’S VAN, PARKED — MOMENTS LATER

A worried-looking Brad sits in the passenger seat staring at Larry.

For once is silent, and entirety still. He stares down at the
steering wheel like a man who has fallen into the deepest possible

BRAD
Larry?
He doesn’t respond.

Larry?

What did she mean by that?
Larry looks up, furious.
LARRY
Oh, don’t pretend you don’t know about
me! Everybody knows! Everybody!
Larry looks Like he may hit Brad.
Brad’s hand slips down to the door, ready to jump out if he has to.
BRAD
(careful, but sincere}
Honest, Larry. I don't know anything, I
mean I remember hearing something a few
years age when ve first moved here.
Something about a shooting at the mall,
but that’s about it. I didn’t even know
you then.
barry looks convinced. Then embarrassed.

LARRY
I’m sorry...sorry.

Brad just stares at hin,

Larry stares down at his hands. Then up te Brad.

A moment.

I still can still see that boy's face,
staring up at me.

LARRY
by rote
Dispatch said there was a shooter loose
at the mall,..It was the end of my shift.
Ten minutes — ten minutes and it woulda
been someone else.

Brad watches his friend disappear. All the air is out of him.

Silence,

BRAD
But it was an accident. You were trying
to stop the guy, and the boy got caught
in the crossfire right?

LARRY
No. I panicked. There was no shooter.
Just the boy. Antoine Harris was his
name. Big for his age, only thirteen-
years-old. He was a good kid. Thought it
was a big joke, waving around an airgun
at his friend at the Big 5. They were
acting out a scene from some movie they
liked. Shop girl saw it from across the
way... called 911,

BRAD
Jesus, Larry — that’s terrible.
But you didn’t know. It coulda been real.

LARRY

this kind of intimacy.

LARRY
I was diagnosed with post-traumatic

LARRY

Like what? Drive a fork lift at Costco?

BRAD
Maybe you could go back to school.

Larry stares daggers into Brad.

LARRY
I loved my job. I don’t want to do
anything else.

Larry's gaze drifts back to the McGorvey’s front porch.

LARRY
You ever think about the term homeland
security? I mean really think about it?

All hills and valleys. The curve of a hip traced by a finger tip. It
moves down the waist and continues to the shoulder. Sarah rolls onto
her back, stares up at the ceiling, and smiles, Brad leans in and
they gently kiss. Lovers who are sated, and comfortable lying in each

INT. TOWNHOUSE, ENTRYWAY ~ MAGIC

A small foyer, flanked on both walls by large framed posters: The
first from Chez Panisse, the other a typical country landscape from
Provence.

SARAH

Really?

JEAN
Don’t worry "re not the only little
sister here’ thnight.

SI
(relieved)
Oh. That’s good.

Sarah peers into the living room, an airy art~filled space lit only
by the early evening sun. Several women chat amiably around a coffee
table -- ONE OF THE WOMEN turns her head toward the foyer. Sarah’s
expression tightens, as if in sudden pain.

INT. TOWNHOUSE, LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Mary Ann’s face. She looks offended.

MARY ANN
Did anybody like this book? _
Because I really just hated it.

PULL BACK to reveal the BOOK GROUP, four OLDER WOMEN, plus two LITTLE
SISTERS, Sarah and Mary Ann. They sit around a coffee table brimming
with wine, cheese, fruit & crackers.

MARY ANN
It’s 30 depressing. She cheats on her
husband with two different guys, wastes
all his money, then kills herseif with rat
poison. Do I really need to read this?

The book group is dismayed by this blunt declaration.
LAUREL, @ youthful sixty year-old, ventures a response.
LAUREL
Well, there is a lot of good descriptive
writing.

The other ladies nod.in vigorous agreement. JOSEPHINE, short and
plump, takes the baton,

JOSEPEINE
It's supposed to be depressing. It’s a
tragedy. Madame Bovary’s undone by a
tragic flaw.
—68-

Next we hear from BRIDGET, a Gertrude Stein look~a~-like.

BRIDGET
What's her flew?

JOSEPHINE:
Blindness. She can’t see that the men are
just using her.

JEAN
She just wants a little romance in her
life. You can’t blame her for that.

BRIDGET
It’s about women’s choices. Back then a
woman didn’t have a lot of choices. You
could be a nun or a wife. That's all
there was,

_ JOSEPHINE
Or a prostitute.

Mary Ann fixes her gaze pointedly on Sarah.

MARY ANN
She had a choice. She had a choice not to
cheat on her husband.

BRIDGET
Usually it’s the man who cheats. I found
it refreshing to read about a woman
reclaiming her sexuality.

MARY ANN
Reclaiming her sexuality? Is that a nice
way of saying she’s a slut?

JOSEPEINE

(miffed)

Madame Bovary is not a slut. She's one of
the great characters in Western
literature.

An uncomfortable silence. Then ~-
LAUREL
I was a little puzzled by the some of
the sexual references.
She opens her PAPERBACK, annotated with POST-IT TAPE FLAGS.

I’m really eager to hear what our other
little sister has to say.

Jean raises her voice to get Sarah’s attention.

JEAN
I'm not sure if you know this, but
Sarah’s got a Ph.D. in English Lit.

Sarah startles to the present, picking up her cue.

SARAH
* Just a Master’s, I never wrote my
dissertation.

JEAN
Well, you still have a lot more expertise
than the rest of us.

Mary Ann rolis her eyes at this. Then levels them at Sarah.

Sarah smiles at Mary Ann, as if the two of them are friends.

SARA
i think I understand your feelings about
this book, I used to feel the same way
myself. When I read it in ged school,
Madame Bovary just seemed like a fool. She
makes one foolish mistake after another.
But_when I read it this time, I just fell
in love with her. She's trapped. She can
either accept a life of misery or struggle
against it. And she chooses to struggle.

MARY ANN

__ SARAE
She fails in the end. But there’s |
something beautiful and even heroic in
her rebellion. My professors would kill
me for sven thinking this, but in her own
strange way, Emma Bovary is a feminist.

MARY ANN

Ob, that’s nice. So now cheating on your
husband makes you a feminist?

SARAK
No, It’s not the cheating. It’s the
hunger. The hunger for an alternative.
And the refusal to accept a life of

unhappiness.
The other ladies beam with approval and fascination.
Mary Ann just shakes her head in disgust.
MARY ANN
Maybe I didn’t understand the book. She
just looked so pathetic...

Sarah resurfaces from the floor of the car looking completely

Sarah tries to look concerned rather than excited.

You did?

BRAD
Yeah. It was are annual argument. About

depends on it.

RONNIE gazes across the place at a nearby booth, where A FAMILY with
TWO YOUNG CHILDREN, a BOY & GIRL, ages 9 and 10, start on their
dessert. The children laugh as their FATHER and’ MOTHER engage them in
some kind of game.

Ronnie, with great difficulty, pulis his attention away from then,

and takes the last bite of his food. He looks across the table at
SHEILA, who stares down at her plate. She hasn't touched a bite.

RONNIE’
Sheila?

Oh, all kinds. Mostly psychotropic.

Sheila nods.

You were that young?
Shelia nods. Grateful for his interest and concern.

RONNIE
What happened?

SHEILA
+-+3'm not really sure,

RONNIE
Nervous breakdowns don't just come outta
nowhere. Something musta caused it.

Sheila sits in front of her untouched meal, concentrating hard, as if
responding to a therapist.

SHEILA
I guess. But I was fine when i left for
college. Maybe it was the stress of being
on my own. Maybe it was a chemical
imbalance in my brain. Every psychiatrist
I go to has a different opinion. This one
gay, Dy. Parris, said I must have been
Sexually abused as a child, When I told
him I wasn’t, he just said I was
repressing the memory.

Uncomfortable, Ronnie changes direction.

Right. So what happened after that? You

Yes. Weap it up, please. I‘1l take it home.

You folks gonna want dessert?
RONNIE

Shelia just stares at Ronnie, Smitten,
EXT/INT. SHEILA'S BUICK, MOVING - NIGHT
Ronnie & Sheila ride in silence.

RONNIE
Let's make a little stop. Take the next left.

She suppresses a smile, enchanted by his take-charge attitude.
INT/EXT, SHEILA’S BUICK, WALKER STREET PARK — NIGHT
he Buick is parked on an empty street with its HEADLIGHTS still on.

RONNIE
Turn off the lights.
Sheila switches them off.
Shelia faces straight ahead, so does Ronnie.

The date seems to have had a positive effect on Sheila, or maybe the
medication’s wearing off. Her voice sounds livelier, a little less
spacey.

I had a nice time tonight.
Ronnie doesn’t reply.

SHEILA
The last guy I went out with, you know
what he did? He ditched me. Got up to go
to the men’s room, and never came back.
Stuck me with the check. Never said
goodbye, never called to apologize.

Still nothing from Ronnie.

super normal ay, a ETF shot CPA. He
dida’t want to dating some psycho.

A smile plays at the corners of her mouth.
~80—

SHEILA
But you seem like a nice person.

She turns slowly, as if volunteering for a kiss. It is only then that
she sees what he is up to.

His right hand begins moving up and down on his lap, and his
breathing rapidly increases.

Shelia watches from the corner of her eye. She sort of hums to
herself, like a child on a ride that they are frightened of, and hope
will be over soon.

Romie looks up at her, his face fierce.

RONNIE
You better not tell on me.

Shelia continues to hum.
RONNIE
{ louder)
You hear me?!
She nods ~ but begins to cry.
RONNIE .
You better not tell, or I'll fuckin’ get
you.

Ronnie stares at her as he huff and puffs. His eyes stray slightly to
the left, and just past her.

She turns away from him suddenly, and it is only then that the true
focus of Ronnie’s attention is visible out the driver's window —

THE PLAYGROUND

Sheila’s car pulls up at the curb. Ronnie gets out, holding his
DOGGIE BAG from the restaurant. Without a word her car speeds away.

Kathy sits waiting in the driver seat, Aaron, securely fastened in
his car seat, oblivious to his mother’s hopes and expectations.

Brad arrives and gets in.

Kathy makes a quick study of her husband's demeanor.

The test, dummy. How'd it go?

Kathy is caught off-guard by this response. She decides to ignore it.
INT/EXT, SARAH‘S HOUSE, SUNROOM — MAGIC
Sarah grabs her overnight bag from the.car and heads toward the
sunroom. The place is transformed: STREAMERS, DRAWINGS on glass
panes, and a HOME MADE SIGN on butcher paper running the width

of the room: UPPER CASE letters written by Jean, and pictures of
people with CIRCLE BODIES, AND LINES OUT OF THEIR HEADS by Lucy ~

The sign reads: WELCOME HOME MOMMY
Sarah eyes the place warily, then turns from the room and heads
outdoors. She rounds the side of the house, looking to make a more
comfortable entrance through the kitchen door.
SARAH'S HOUSE, KITCHEN — MAGIC
Sarah enters to find Jean sitting at the table, knitting and
listening to NPR.
JEAN
Look who's back.
SARAH
Thanks, Jean. You're a lifesaver.
JEAN

SARAE . .
Oh great, great. Thanks for doing this on

The woman leoks surprised, and somewhat insulted.

JEAN
That's not necessary.

Sarah pulls some bills out.

SARAB
No, really. I insist.
Jean’s face wears the look of someone who has just discovered what a
person she thought was a friend, really thinks of her.
JEAN

Please don’t.

SARAB

Jean begins gathering up her knitting and her craft box.
Any calls?

No, it's been very quiet.

busy day.

SARAH

Well, that’s great. Thanks again.
Jean heads out the door.

SARAE

Jean turns around and looks at Sarah. She is about to honestly answer

INT, BRAD'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM — NIGHT — CONTINUOUS

Kathy site next to Sarah, both sipping their wine. They've made
themselves comfortable with each other while secretly Sizing each
other up at the same time.

Brad listens to Richard ~ who’s mid-story in an oft-told tale about
his product consulting business.

, BRAD
So, you're in adverting?

RICHARD
No. That's a common mistake. I’m in
branding. And that's really very
different.

SARAHB
Richard‘s pretty high up in the company.

Kathy smiles at Sarah's seeming support of Richard. She shoots a look
to Brad as if to say, “isn’t it sweet how proud she is of this dolt?”

Brad smiles back at his wife.
This is not lost on Sarah, and she begins eating at a rapid pace.

RICHARD
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like the other da
these guys come to me, and they want to
start a chain of Chinese restaurants.

He pause for dramatic effect.

RICHARD
And not one of them is Chinese!

Everyone at the table is sort of waiting for the punch-line, which
never arrives.

Brad and Kathy force polite laughter. Sarah looks miserable.
Fortunately, Brad tries to pick up the thread.

BRAD
Well, where were they from?

RICHARD
They're a bunch of fat cats from
Tennessee. But they think they can create
a chain of restaurants authentic enough
to fool the average American boob.

More forced laughter from Brad & Kathy. Sarah wishes Richard would
just shut up. She turns to Kathy, and tries to change the subject.

SARAB
. {res dinner)
This is delicious.

RATHY
Ten't it?
bh

She looks across the table at Brad, and smiles.

KATHY
Brad's a fantastic cook.

Sarah is nearly at the end of her rope, and uncertain how much longer
she can endure this very strange dynamic.

RICHARD .
So, have you seen these flyers with the
guy's face plastered ali over the
village? Lots of sturm and drang in our
quiet little town, eh?

BRAD
Tt's crazy.

RICHARD
What T want to know is why they let a
creep like that out of prison.

SARAH
Some of the people going after him are
just as crazy.

KATHY
What do you mean?

SARAH
Well, just today I heard that some nut’s
been geray-paintin ,the poor guy"s house,
pighting ires on his porch, and God
knows what else.

Brad shrinks.
KATHY
Do they know who's doing it?

SARAH
They think it’s some ex-cop.

Kathy glances at Brad.

SARAB
You know, that guy who killed the kid at
the mall.

BRAD
{almost too fast}
T don’t think it’s him.

KATHY
You're biased.
{to Sarah)
Brad is friends with the guy. They're
both on that Committee of Concerned
Parents.

Sarah stares at Brad, perplexed.

SARAHB
I didn't know you were on that.

BRAD
{

(nervous } .
I play on his football team. And he asked
me to distribute some flyers.

SARAB
{wounded}
Hie’s on your team? You never told me that.

Kathy looks startled. It’s odd to hear such a possessive tone coming
out of another woman’s mouth, She studies the dynamics of the table.
Every gesture, and every word, now viewed through a microscope.

RICHARD
You know what's weird? I’ve never even
seen this McGorvey guy.

. SARAB
We did.

RICHARD
No, we didn't.

SARAH
(reclaiming her position}
Not you. Me and Brad. That day at the
pool, remember?

Brad is unable to mask his discomfort with this question.

BRAD
{to Sarah's question)
Oh yeah, I forgot.

Kathy stares at Brad.

VOLCE
Sexual tension is an elusive thing, but
Rathy had pretty good radar for it. It
was like someone had turned a knob a
hair to the right...

Kathy’s view shifts to the RIGHT - To now include SARAH IN THE FRAME
WITH BRAD for the first time in the scene.

VOICE
-.-and the radio station clicked in so
joud and clear it almost knocked her
over, Once she became aware of the
connection between them, it seemed
impossible that she'd missed it before.
On @ hunch...

Kathy steals a look toward her own hand as it ~
Inches toward her FORK.

VOICE
Kathy dropped her fork...
~B8—

Her hand “accidentally” knecks the FORK to the FLOOR, It falls end-
over-end in SLOW MOTION.

She slips under the table to retrieve the utensil.

VOICE
«--in the hopes that while retrieving it
she would catch Sarak and Brad playing
footsie.

Kathy stares at the forest of legs beneath the table. No footsie of
any kind is in progress.

VOICE
But she was mistaken.

Kathy looks frozen, like a deer in the headlights, not sure what to
do next. She makes no move to join the others.

BRAD (0.C.)
Kathy? Are you okay?

Kathy’s tries not to hyperventilate.
She stares dumbstruck at SARAH'S ridiculously PAINTED TOES.

KATEY
Yeah...just a sec.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, BATHROOM — NIGHT

Brad stares into the mirror with a big forced grin on his face, The
image is absurd until his hand appears with a TOOTHBRUSH and he
begins his nightly regime.

VOICE
Brad had convinced himself the dinner
pasty had gone well, that he and Sarah
ad inanaged to put Rathy’s suspicions to
rest, at least temporarily.

INT. BRAD'S HOUSE, BEDROOM — NIGaT

He emerges from the bathroom and heads over to join Kathy, who is
already in bed.

VOICE
She certainly hadn't accused him of
anything, or behaved in a way that made
him think she'd noticed anything untoward.

Brad pulls the covers up and glances at Kathy. She smiles.

KATHY
I’m really glad they came over.

Brad smiles back, confident that his deception has been a success. He
#20 over, kisses her on the cheek, then reaches up and kills the

To the supermarket...

Aaron sits in a SHOPPING CART; Brad and Marjorie stand in a long
checkout line, not speaking a word to one another.

Brad's eyes drift toward the magazine rack and land innocently on a
bikini-clad model on the cover of Fitness.

As he turns his attention back to the line, he becomes aware of
Marjorie’s sternly disapproving face.

EXT. TOWN POOL ~ DAY

Brad & Aaron are in their usual spot, with the addition of Marjorie.

Brad cranes his neck, pretending to reach for something in his bag,

SLOW 200M OUT from the flag high above the stadium, as banks of PAR

The empty bleachers.

Their opponents, the CONTROLLERS, a bunch of spandex-clad, twenty-

With less than a minute to go, trailing

CLOSE ON BRAD'S HANDS, opening like a clamshell against LARRY’S ASS
as he takes the snap.

BRAD bootlegs right, looking first for RITCHIE MURPHY, his short man.
Covered.

Ditto on BART, his middle receiver.
BRAD cocks the ball, ready to throw to —

DEWAYNE, his last and best chance, only to watch him slip and fall as
he makes his cut.

BRAD loops back to avoid the pass rush. He looks up to see open field
ahead. He tucks the ball and runs. Fifteen, twenty, twenty five yards,
the field pitching toward him with each pounding stride.
~9}—

THE CONTROLLERS begin to gain on him. Out of nowhere DEWAYNE pulls up
beside him to run interference, but THE CONTROLLERS NUMBER 39 trips
wp DEWAYNE, leaving BRAD exposed to THE CONTROLLERS speed demon

ER 23, He’s only inches away from the tackle when suddenly LARRY,
screaming like a banshee, flies between the two men and flattens THE
CONTROLLER.

THE CONTROLLERS, NUMBER 9 catches up to BRAD as he crosses the
fifteen yard-line. BRAD slams on the brakes so drastically and
unexpectedly that his pursuer simply goes zooming past him with a
desolate cry of protest stumbling out of bounds and leaving Bi
with a clear path to the end zone. He spins on his heels and jogs
backwards into the end zone, the ball raised triumphantly overhead.

He spikes the ball, his arms stretch wide, his chest heaving.

BRAD searches the STANDS for a witness te his glorious moment. To his
surprise, he sees —

SARAH in the top row of the BLEACHERS - she’s seen it ail. The music
crescendoes to a finale as their eyes meet.

{shouting} .
Karen! Call an ambulance right now!

|, KAREN (0.C.)
I’m doing it.

Larry finally sees what has happened, and tentatively makes his way
over. He stares at May's twitching limbs and hears ah AWFUL GURGLING
NOISE coming from somewhere deep in her throat. Her eyes are WIDE
OPEN, staring straight into his. Her lips are moving, but there
aren’t any words coming out. He looks scared.

LARRY
Oh, Fuck. This is all 7 need,
EXT. HECGORVEY HOUSE, FRONT YARD ~ LATER
GUMBALL LIGHT Rakes everything, People in nearby houses gawk from
their porches, Other neighbors make their way down the street to get
a better look at the scene.

MAY, attached to 02 and an IV DRIP, lies supine on a GURNEY as she is
loaded into a waiting ambulance by two EMT’s.

LARRY sits in the back of a POLICE CRUISER watching it all.

A POLICE OFFICER leads RONNIE away from his mother’s side, and back
toward the front of the house. Ronnie turns his back on the cop. At
this moment he is only interested in looking at one man ~

LARRY -- locked in the backseat of the squad car.

Ronnie’s gaze is filled with an intensity we have never seen,
Larry, sees it too, and is the first to look away.

EXT. TAXICAB, EAST WYNDAM PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL ~ NIGHT

A cab pulls up to the curb. Ronnie gets out of the car, holding a
WOMAN'S TRAVEL CASE, and heads toward the hospital entrance.

INT. ICU, WAITING ROOM — NIGHT

A TELEVISION mounted from the ceiling drones Bloomberg.

Other than a TEENAGE GIRL, reading Time Magazine, Ronnie is alone.
A hand appears in front of him, holding a CUP OF COFFEE. He looks up
in surprise to see -

A 30 year-old PUERTO RICAN WOMAN extending the beverage.

PUERTO RICAN WOMAN
Cafe con leche?

He nods, gratefully taking the cup from her hand. She sits down
beside Aim and drinks from her own cup.

She opens her wallet and leans over to him, displaying its contents:
A Sears portrait of an older Puerto Rican woman.

PUERTO RICAN WOMAN
Madre.

Ronnie pats his pockets, and realizes he has no photo of May to
share. He nods to the woman.

RONNIE
Me too. She's resting now.

IN’. ICQ, MAY'S ROOM - SAME

May lies in a hospital bed, attached to a ventilator, catheter, ERG

INT. EAST WYNDAM POLICE STATION — SAME

A HAND, attached to the HASH MARKED SLEEVE of a POLICEMAN’S SHIRT,

passes a MAN'S BELT, a PACK OF CHEWING GUM, and a WEDDING BAND across

@ recess on the underside of a Plexiglas walled counter. On the other

Side of the divider, a PAIR OF HANDS attached to a familiar SWEAT

SHIRT receive the above.

On a PRISONER RELEASE FORM, a signature is made on a line above a
typed name ~ Larry Hedges. .

A WALL MOUNTED SECURITY MONITOR memorializes the exchange.

EXT. POLICE IMPOUND YARD — LATER

The street is empty, except for Larry, who glances around in all
directions, as he makes his way over to a chain-length-fence, and
rests his hands against it.

Out of nowhere A BARRING GERMAN SHEPARD leaps spread~eagle onto the
fence and tries to bite Larry.

Larry, safely on the other side, jumps back, startled.

A LARGE MAN with a pot belly emerges from the impound office and
pulls the dog back.

LARGE MAN
Get down — knock it off!

He grabs a chain that is permanently fastened to the side of the
bul ding and attaches it to the animal’s collar. Then opens the chain-
length-tence. The dog continues to bark.

Larry backs away, putting as much distance between himself and the
Shepard as he can. Headlights smack Larry in the face as his van
emerges from the back recesses of the lot, and pulls up to the fence.
Larry clocks the dog as he steps forward to retrieve his van.

The animal gives a constant low growl, not taking his eyes off Larry
for a second.

Larry throws the van into gear, and takes off.
INT. LARRY'S VAN — NIGHT
He drives as if in a trance. Larry looks worriedly down at his right

hand, which shakes uncontrollably. He tries to steady it by gripping
the wheel, as if his life depended upon it.

Ronnie stirs.

Ronnie just stares at her.

EXT, HOSPITAL, PARKING LOT ~ FOLLOWING AFTERNOON

A dazed Ronnie leaves the hospital, clutching May's travel case. He
heads down the sidewalk, but stops suddenly when he sees —

The same cab that dropped him off the night before, waiting at the
curb. Ronnie heads over and gets into the back seat. The car pulls
away.

As it leaves the hospital parking lot it passes —

LARRY, sitting in his van at the other end of the parking lot — watching.

Ronnie’s hands unpack May’s travel case, He removes each item, and
gently lays them onto the bed: A compact, a toothbrush, moisturizing
creme, and a hairbrush. He is about to ciose the lid, when he spots
something on the bottom of the case, AN ENVELOPE with a single word
roughly scrawled across its front - “Ronnie.”

INT. MCGORVEY HOUSE, KITCHEN ~— NIGHT

The kitchen light flicks on. Ronnie stands in the doorway, the
unopened envelope in his hand, taking stock of the mess he’s made in
the past few days — UNWASHED DISHES piled up in the sink, yesterday’s
HALF~EATEN DINNER still sitting on the table, right next to an
OVERFLOWING ASHTRAY.

A PLAY~TEX RUBBER GLOVE is tugged over a hand.

The faucet runs, filling a pot with sudsy water.

A determined Ronnie reaches for a sponge & gets down to work.

LATER

The gloves come off, and are tossed in the sink. The kitchen looks
clean.

Ronnie crosses over to the kitchen table and sits.

He stares at_the UNOPENED ENVELOPE, now resting in the fruit basket.
He tentatively picks it up, and slowly turns if over in his hands.
How long should he wait to have this conversation with his mother?
He waits, but a moment, and then opens it.

A single line of script, “Please be a good boy.”
ifs.

His face begins te contort, as if he’s in real pain. He drops the
piece of paper and flees the kitchen.

LIVING ROOM

He flies into the room, talking to himself, while he moves straight
to the many shelves full of HUMMEL FIGURINES. He stares at a myriad
of innocent faces, The little boys & girls in halcyon settings seem
to be mocking him. it is the hour, and suddenly all of the clocks
begin to strike. So does Ronnie. With a frightening intensity -
smashing, throwing, and destroying the figurines, the clocks ~ all of
it, He displays an energy and determination we have never seen.

of husband & wife. Kathy standing in front of Brad — protective.

HALLWAY

Marjorie and Kathy busy themselves with after-dinner clean-up, In the

EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE — NIGHT

Sarah emerges with the child on her hip, her free hand struggling
with the overnight bag and a Barbie backpack. She barrels toward her

impossibility of Lucy’s car seat.

INT. MCGORVEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT
Looking wild-eyed and muttering angrily to himself, Ronnie rummages

sharpness.
EXT. WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND ~— NIGHT

Sarah, carrying Lucy, arrives at the playground, entering through the

without the obstacle of a gatekeeper.

LARRY
Ronnie?

ERT, MAIN STREET — NIGHT

Brad, carrying his bag, walks past the darkened businesses in the

Finally he picks up the pace to his normal gate — breaks into a trot,
and then a full out sprint.

EXT. WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND — SAME

Sarah pushes Lucy on the swing. She steals a look at her watch, and
then glances toward the front gate. She turns back around and
continues pushing the swing. Her ears perk up at the sound of RAPIDLY
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS she smiles. The gate clanks open. She smiles
and turns toward the sound. But instead of finding Brad ~

It's RONNIE.

His hands are buried beneath his shirt, and he is moaning. His
hunched-over figure makes his way past her, and over to the swingset
at the opposite end of the park.

Oh, my God.

Almost unconsciously, she continues to push Lucy. The metronomic
rhythm some sort of odd comfort. She keeps her eyes trained on this
man, and then steals an expectant look back toward —

THE ENTRANCE OF THE PLAYGROUND.

Brad sprints down the street past the library, But at precisely this
moment “G" comes flying through the air on his skateboard, sails
right | across his path. Brad comes to a complete stop. His eyes follow
the boy.

Hey, dude. What‘s your hurry?

As if in a trance, Brad walks straight up to the skateboarders, who

are gathered around a steep concrete stairway. He has never been this

close .to them. Brad stands next to ”G”, who watches one of his

minions fly off the staircase. The boy turns to him, extending his

on with shouts, whoops, and cries of encouragement. He will need it.
His approach to the stairway is coming up fast. It must be right.
Rere it is. He launches off the stairway, catching an unbelievable
amount of air.

EXT, WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND — SAME

Sarah, trying to ignore Ronnie‘s presence, glances over her shoulder
expecting Brad’s arrival.

The SOUND of Ronnie sobbing is something she can no longer ignore.
She turns to see —

Him hunched over on his swing, crying uncontrollably.
She pauses just a moment, and then abandons Lucy’s swing, and makes
her way over toward the other end of the park. Stopping half-way
between the two structures.
She wears a look of uncertainty on her face as she takes a couple of
hesitant steps in his direction.
SARAH

Re looks up at her in shock, and then nods.
RONNIE

He drops his head back down, and continues to sob. What he says from
this point on is to himself. For him, Sarah no longer exists.
RONNIE ;
Mommy died... mommy died...
Sarah is at a complete loss, She stands dumbstruck for a moment.

The SOUND of the ENTRANCE GATE clanking shut, turns her around,
expecting to find Brad.

Instead she finds Lucy's empty swing, swaying back-and-forth.

Sarah panics.

Lucy?!

Nothing.

Lucy!!!
Nothing.
The child is nowhere in sight. Sarah scans the tiny playground.
The child has disappeared. Sarah sprints away from Ronnie, and begins
searching the shadows.

SARAH

Sarah sprints toward the entrance, and emerges onto —
THE STREET ~ She looks up and down in both directions. Her face primal,
as is her cry. .

LUCYILiT
A moment of terror that feels like an eternity.
Finally, about a hundred yards down the sidewalk she sees —

LUCY — The child stands at the base of a street light staring up at
the lamp, as if hypnotized.

INSECTS flutter in groups, propelling themselves against the vapor.
The child is utterly absorbed.

Sarah's face relaxes. Though it wears the confusion of her sudden
outburst and momentary sense of loss.

Lucy looks down at her mother, concerned.

She lifts up her tiny hand and places it on top of Sarah’s head ~
gently stroking it, back and forth.

LUCY
It's okay, mommy. It’s okay.

Lucy continues to caress Sarah's head, and this seems to calm her.
Sarah raises her head up, and looks at her daughter. Her eyes
unwavering, transfixed by the child’s face, which greets her with
unconditional trust. The two suspended together. Nothing else exists.
Lucy stares at her mother curiously.
And it is in this moment that something essential in Sarah completely
transforms.

She leans forward and embraces her daughter.

SARAR

She kisses her daughter's nose, forehead, and cheek.

EXT. WALKER STREET PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

From a distance we see Ronnie sitting alone on his swing, still
hunched forward with his hands in his lap, moaning. Slowly we make up
the distance, moving toward him - The SOUND of gravel under moving
feet — Someone is coming.

As we arrive at his back, the crunch of gravel STOPS. Still lost in
his own private hell, Ronnie is oblivious. A large male hand reaches
out and comes to rest on his shoulder.

MALE VOICE (0.€.)
I'm so sorry Ronnie...I really am.

Ronnie's head pits up. Suddenly present. His face scared, but also
angry. He is looking at —

Ronnie just stares at him.
Ashamed, Larry averts his eyes, and stares at the ground.
and he sees something from this proximity that Sarah completely missed
from her vantage point: beneath the seat of Ronnie’s swing, drops of

trickle to the below. :
Larry’s eyes go wide. He looks up te Ronnie.
