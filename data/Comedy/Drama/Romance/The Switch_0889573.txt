SOMETHING SO RIGHT

INT. MANHATTAN - DAY

And here’comes everybody. Talking on cells, walking briskly
and checking watches.
1 ‘

' . '

CARD: MARCH... 2000

Eighth Avenue alive in the mid-ddy. ‘Hundreds of heads
bobbing up and down as they walk -- all together and at the
same time... all very alone. ' ,

1 VOICE OF WALLY MARS
Look at us. All players of the
genetic lottery filteréd through
thousands of years of evolution.

INT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE/SUBWAY STATION - DAY , \

by :
The daily melting pot of throng... ‘
‘ tor 1
VOICE OF WALLY MARS

Think of all the losers in

history's cache... the ones that

failed to procreate. The ones not

worthy of offspring.

All waiting for the train. Short... tall... thin... fat...

VOICE OF WALLY MARS
The poor victims of evolution that
were too weak or ugly to make it to
this point. The ones that died off
' long ago... undoubtedly alone in
some cave... taking their flawed
blood-lines with them.

... fashion victims... bad haircuts... buck teeth...
VOICE OF WALLY MARS
But we don’t have to worry about
them. Because we're the winners.

A homeless man kicks around an imaginary soccer ball.
People stay well clear of him.

VOICE OF WALLY MARS
Even that guy.

INT. UPTOWN A,C,E - DAY

A full car. They read, they listen to iPods, they stare off
into a distance that isn’t there.
1

‘

‘ VOICE OF WALLY MARS
But we all still have to play the
genetic lottery... even before

we're born.
'

And we find him. WALLY MARS. He looks around the car with a
strain of disdain on his otherwise blank face.

Wally looks at a beautiful girl in her late teens with red hair.

VOICE OF WALLY MARS
Some of us winning a lifetime of
free apple martinis...
And now Wally looks at a rail-thin guy with a pock-marked face.'

VOICE OF WALLY MARS

Others handed extended virginities

laden with excessive masturbation

and confusing misogyny.

AND WALLY
fashionable and youthful but not conventionally handsome.
INT. THE DOWNTOWN 4,5,6 - DAY

We’re on another subway car. Looking at men. One after the
other. Stop on a dark haired man wearing a suit.

VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON
Good posture... clear eyes...
that’s important.

He cracks open the new issue of “The Federalist.”
VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON
Republican... that sucks. I feel
violated for even admiring.
Now we find blond haired guy in an old sweatshirt.

VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON
Great skin-tone. Baby-face.

We scan down to his shoes. Lifts. Three inch soles.

VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON
Boy heels. Such a shame.

And we’re now looking at Professor looking type wearing
circular rimmed glasses and a shaggy sweater.

VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON
Mid-forties with all his hair.
Poor eye-sight...

(MORE )
‘
VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON (cont'd)
but with that new Lasik thing,
what’s it matter? Tall...

The guy lifts up his book... “Letters To, Young Poet.”
VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON

And he reads Rilke... we have a
winner! ' '
And now we see her -- staring straight dt him. ‘

KASSIE LARSON . 1

33, big brown eyes, undeniably feminine, flawless skin, '
cultivated, fashionable without being in fashion... she’s
what. perfection wishes for while'sitting on Santa's lap. ‘

i
VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON ‘

.I have to see the tongue. It’s all ,

about the tongue... our | ‘

grandchildren’s health is in that

tongue. But it might be weird to

ask him to show me.

And he looks up from his book'to catch this beauty staring at :
him. So he smiles -- his teeth yellowed and askew.

As she quickly looks away.

VOICE OF KASSIE LARSON .
Yikes. Not so much. ’

EXT. 14TH STREET — DAY
Wally waits at a light with the bustle around him.
He notices a guy wearing a METS HAT standing on the corner.

Mets Hat sways from side to side and shouts out something to
himself. Wally takes note.

METS HAT
Fat-slanty-eyed-pedaling-—bitch.
Fat-slanty—eyed-pedaling-bitch.

And Wally turns to see a heavy Chinese woman riding by on a
bicycle. Met’s Hat isn’t shouting it at her but more
announcing what he sees to himself -- obviously mentally ill
with some form of Tourettes. And now he spits out...

METS HAT
pig-faced-gimpy-limpin’-mama. Pig-
faced-gimpy-limpin’-mama limpin’ on
by.

Wally turns to see a woman limping by. And her face does
have pig-like features...
' METS HAT ,
Potato~head-looking-motherfucker.
Potato-head-looking-motherfucker.

As Wally turns back to see... Mets Hat starring right at him.
7

METS HAT
I gotta potato-head-looking-
motherfucker lookin’. at me.

Wally’s face falls. He just stands there... stunned... the
world sucked out of him. .

The light changes but Wally doesn’t move... frozen in insult.
Horrified. Absolutely crushed.

INT. PASTIS - DAY

Wally and Kassie eat lunch at this trendy Meat-packing
District restaurant. It’s,crowded. Above the din...
" '
KASSIE
You are not a potato-head-looking-
motherfucker.

WALLY
Iam. I’m a potato-head-looking-
motherfucker.

KASSIE
Wally, he was mentally ill.
Standing on the corner.

WALLY
Exactly. He had no reason to be
polite. It was like this Tourette-
style truth-serum affliction.

She's laughing.

KASSIE
Wally please. This can't really be
bothering you.

WALLY
No, no. Because the “fat-slanty-
eyed-pedaling-bitch” was fat and on
a bicycle. And the “pig-faced-
gimpy-limpin’-mama” did have a pig
face. So I am a potato-head-
looking-motherfucker.

KASSIE
Wally, you’re adorable.
Silence -- he’s genuinely upset. They continue to eat.
Wally moans as he savors the food. It sounds almost sexual.
‘ KASSIE
Wally!
' '
He snaps out of it. '
___ KASSIE mot

Stop making love to your food.
1 . ' i)
WALLY
I don’t even know when I do it.
KASSIE ‘
1 It’s disturbing. , ‘
He continues to eat. Until he looks up to say...

' . WALLY
I have a growth. ' oo
/KASSIE ,
What? ' ‘
WALLY

I think it’s'a tumor. It's ina
very difficult place to tell.

KASSIE
You’re fine, Wally.

WALLY
' It’s down there. In my... under-
carriage.

KASSIE
Your scrotum?

WALLY
No. Behind it. In-between there
and my--

KASSIE
Your perineum. It’s called a
perineum.

WALLY
Well, I had to see it. So I--

She holds up her hand.

KASSIE
I don’t think I want to know.
WALLY
You're right, it’s probably best.

A silence, then...,

KASSIE
Okay, I have to know. What did you
do, Wally?
WALLY '
I took a picture of it. With my
phone.
' KASSIE
What?
WALLY

This Swedish company we’re taking
public places cameras inside cell-

‘ phones. It's the coolest thing...
you can e-mail the pictures.

KASSIE
(incredulous )
You took a picture of it?
WALLY
Well, the mirrors didn’ t work so
Ir lied down on the bed and opened
my legs and--
She stops him there.

KASSIE
Jesus, Wally.

He opens his phone and scrolls through the pictures.

WALLY
I want you to see it.

KASSIE
No. way!

He finds the picture and slides the phone over to her.
WALLY
It’s life or death, Kassie.
I have prostate cancer.
She clinches her eyes shut and slides it back.

KASSIE
You don’t have prostate cancer.
‘WALLY
Just look at it for a second.

‘ KASSIE
Not on your life!

1
Wally accepts that and closes his phone.
 KASSIE rot
Wally... you’re exhausting.

. ’
He nods. Silence. Until he sighs in defeat...
WALLY

I’m a potato-head-looking-
1 motherfucker. .

EXT. HUDSON RIVER WALKING PATH - DAY

tu .
Kassie and Wally walk by the river. A crisp spring day.
She has her arm around him. The pace'is slow.

\KASSIE ,
I had an epiphany: and I'm going to
need your help.

WALLY
An epiphany...

KASSIE
Yes. And I don’t want you to say
anything until I am done talking,
okay?

WALLY
Fine.

KASSIE
Okay. I’m thirty-three years old,
Wally and I want a child. And it’s
all been plan A. One plan. Meet a
man, date, move in together, get
married and then have a child.
Plan A.

WALLY
Thirty-three’s still young.

KASSIE
What happened to the you not
talking part?

He just shrugs.
' RASSIE

Look, I’m done with plan A. Plan A
isn't working. Let’s face it --

the landscape is. littered

with

adulterers, losers, hit and
runners, village burners...

WALLY
You're being dramatic.

KASSIE 1

Am I? You're taking pictures of
your prostate cancer and I'm the

' one being dramatic.

He capitulates with a nod ~- touche.

She continues...

KASSIE ‘
Plan A is what... idealistic...
dated...

WALLY
Did you ever think that you're
being too picky?

KASSIE
Yes. I get that. But whatever.
Because see... the real problem

with plan A is that the longer you
devote to it, you diminish time and
investment for plan B. It’s called
“economies of scale,” you’re an
investment banker -- you know the
texm.

WALLY
Kassie, I think you’re confusing--

She stops and faces him.

KASSIE
I‘m ready for plan B, Wally, and
I'm going to need your help.

WALLY
What’s plan B?

KASSIE
Having a baby by myself. Raising a
baby by myself.

He lets it register. Doesn’t like it.

WALLY
That's crazy. What if you do this
then meet the love of your life?
'KASSIE
I'm not meeting shit.

WALLY ‘
What if you already met the love of
your life and you don’t know it? , '

As she dismissively waves the idea off... .
: ‘ ‘

KASSIE

Time's moving. Life’s in session,

Wally.
‘ 1
WALLY

Where’d you get that... an /

' infomercial?
. KASSIE
No.,- + oo

As they cross the West Side Highway..\ |

-KASSIE
Yes. ‘
(and then)
I didn't buy the program -— it was
the only thing on and it resonated.

WALLY .
I think you’re being irrational. . ‘

And now they’re back on the cobblestone streets of the meat
packing district.

KASSIE
I want a baby... I don’t want to
wait anymore... plan A bites...

it’s time for plan B.

She looks at him. Wants his approval. They both know it.

WALLY
I don‘t know...

KASSIE
I‘m so in love with plan B. It’s
devious and inspired... it doesn’t

depend on the hustle of romance and
it’s brave. Let me be brave,
Wally.

WALLY
You don’t need my approval.
' KASSIE
But I value it... and I’m going to
need your help.

And then it dawns on hiin... what she’s Saying... and ‘he
stops... and with a nervous smile...

WALLY
How are you going to need my help?

KASSIE 1
Okay... I’m in the market for

semen, Wally, and...
She stops short. Too nervous to finish the sentence...

WALLY
And...

She draws in a breath of courage, then...

KASSIE
I need you to help me find some.

She resumes walking. He stands there... stunned.

INT. UPTOWN 4,5,6 ~ DAY

Upset, Wally's hangs on to the pole, shaking back and forth.
Kassie sits.

KASSIE
You’re being ridiculous.

WALLY
Answer the question -- what's wrong
with my sperm?

KASSIE
Nothing. I’m sure you have killer
sperm. I just think having a baby
with you might affect our
friendship.

Angry and rejected, Wally shakes his head in disapproval.

WALLY
So what -- you're going to use a
service? You're going to read
resumes? Those things are all
bulishit. I heard about a woman in
Queens who thought she was buying
the sperm of an Ivy League athlete
and it turned it came froma
homeless guy.
11.

-KASSIE
You didn’t hear that.

WALLY
And the kid ended up being
homeless. And,she sued and lost.

: KASSIE
You just made that up.! ‘

He doesn’t deny it. Just stares straight ahead in grimace.

1 KASSIE
Look, I don’t want to choose off
paper anyway. I don‘t'trust it.

: i
WALLY
‘Trust issues.
fa
‘ .. KASSIE :

Yeah, Wally, whatever. 'I need to
see the man. I need to find the
right genes... I can’t do this
alone and you're my best friehd.

Frustrated, he ponders his reflection in the window of the
subway car. He quickly looks away then back down to her.

WALLY
It’s wrong. It eliminates the man.
We’re not racehorses...

KASSIE
' Let‘s do some math, Wally. I meet
my husband today. I date him for a
year before moving in with him.
Then I move in with him and realize
I hate him. He’s not my husband
after all.
(keeps going)
Okay, so now I'm single for a year
before I meet this other guy. Then
I move in with him after a year and
live with him for another. Then we
get engaged. A year later we get
married. Then I get pregnant after
another year. Now, I’m thirty-
eight.

WALLY
(correcting her)
Thirty-nine.

KASSIE
You get it.
And bhe glares at him!

KASSIE
Why are you even on this train?
It’s going uptown -- don’t you have
‘

to be back at work?
.He doesn’t answer. The train stops. Kassie stands.

KASSIE
I‘m hurt you’re not going to
support this.

The doors open.

KASSIE
And you should know something.
Whether you like it or not, Wally
Mars...
As she goes... ‘ . '
KASSIE
Life’s in session.

... leaving Wally in her wake.

INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY

Wally runs on a treadmill. Next to him is his boss, LEONARD,
50s, who walks very slowly on a treadmill that barely moves.

LEONARD
You're jealous.

Sweating and out of breath...

WALLY
I’m not jealous.

LEONARD
You are. She put you in the friend
zone five years.ago after you guys
were set up and you've been there
ever since.

Wally turns up the speed and runs even faster.
Leonard calmly unwraps a Snickers bar.

WALLY
(correcting)
We put each other in the friend
zone. It was a mutual placement.

Sweating... out of breath...
WALLY
If Kassie and I were lovers it
would be a complete train wreck.
| She’s Narcissistic and afraid of
men -- I’m immature and indulgent.

\
As Leonard rolls his eyes as he enjoys his snickers. '

LEONARD ' 1 '
You can throw denial into that bin.
. ‘ ‘
Wally scoffs then leans over to read Leonard’s treadmill to
change the subject. .

WALLY

That thing’s set to three point one
-- you’re barely moving!

Dh LEONARD /
I’miin the fat~burning zone.
You’re going too fast. ' You're not
burning fat. I am.

(and then)

Wally, I don’t want’ this Kasstie
thing effecting your work.

WALLY
I heard you.

Catching his breath...

WALLY
Leonard, you just ate three hundred
‘ calories and burned nine.

EXT. 67TH STREET - NIGHT
Kassie and Wally carry gift-wrapped presents as they walk.

KASSIE
I don’t know. Internet. I’m
thinking a college kid might be a
good idea so I might place an ad in
the local college newspapers.

WALLY
What gualities are you are looking
for in the donor?

KASSIE

Height, athleticism... intelligence.
Sense of humor is most important...

He rolls his eyes.
, KASSIE
What?

WALLY
‘You all ‘say that.

‘

KASSIE
Okay. Height is most important...
but funny height.
(and then)
Oh! I figured out your dog.

WALLY
‘ I don’t want a dog.

KASSIE
No, you do. Listen to me. What
you need is... are you ready?
(drum roll, and... )
++. a Portuguese water dog!

Wally just shakes his head and laughs.
KASSIE
They're highly intelligent,
incredibly loyal and very
affectionate.

WALLY
No thanks.

KASSIE
Just think about it, Wally... you
need very affectionate.
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Wally and Kassie share the elevator with another couple,
holding gift-wrapped presents.

They all look up to the counting numbers.

WALLY
How much are you going to pay?

KASSIE
Twenty thousand.

A moment, then she turns to him and asks...
KASSIE
Is that too much to pay a college
kid to masturbate?

As the couple standing with them share a look...

INT. UPPER-EAST SIDE PARTY - NIGHT

About forty upscale Manhattanites in a large apartment.
Kassie and Wally wait for a drink at the bar.

Still churning this, Kassie turns to him... 1

5 KASSIE
Intelligence is going to be crucial
so we should hit Columbia before NYU.
. ‘ 1
As Wally nods with a smile to someone he knows.
| WALLY ,
And I thought men were shallow.
They get to the bar and order their drinks.
La KASSIE . sa
I know this all sounds vapid but
I’m in a unique situation here.
Look, what do women do when they
choose a man? Whether they‘re
aware of it or not, Wally, they
analyze which man will produce the
healthiest and strongest offspring.

Drinks now in hand, pulling away from the bar...
KASSIE
So, that’s all I’m doing. I’m just
cutting out the middleman.
As they greet a group they know with big smiles and hellos.

INT. PARTY - LATER

Wally’s bored, sipping his drink and smiling to various
people. He spots Kassie locked in conversation with a good
looking dude sporting a five o’clock shadow wearing two
hundred dollar jeans.

As Wally approaches...

WALLY
I'm tired. Can we go?
g

KASSIE
Wally, this is Sandy... he’s from
L.A. Wally’s an investment banker.
Kassie looks right at Sandy as she addresses Wally.

KASSIE
I‘m going to stick around.
» Gandy likes that, holds her charged look. Wally just ‘stands
there staring at Sandy. Making him nervous.

. SANDY
Um... hey Wally... you have any
good stocks for me?

WALLY
They‘re all going straight up
Sandy... it’s the new economy,
fundamentals don’t matter. Put
everything into telecom... optical
networking. Leverage is everything.
Go on margin -- strong and long.

He turns to Kassie.

WALLY ‘
Can I talk to you for a sec?

He pulls her away. ‘ '

KASSIE
What was that? You keep saying
it’s a bubble and to get out.

WALLY
Yeah, I don’t like him. What are
you doing?

KASSIE

I'm flirting. He’s cute.

And it dawns on Wally...

WALLY
You're not thinking--

KASSIE
I haven't seen his tongue yet.

As she checks out Sandy from a distance.

She's not listening to him anymore. As she Looks at Sandy...

WALLY
You're drunk.

KASSIE
I am not.

WALLY

I know when you're drunk, Kassie.
Your eyes squint and your face
smothers into a permanently amazed
glare.
»KASSIE
Look... he’s tall, he has a great
jawline, he’s smart.

WALLY
Smart? He lives in Los Angeles.

She smiles and kisses Wally on the forehead.
' i

KASSIE
Go home, Crazy. I‘m a grown up.

Kassie returns to Sandy.

AND WALLY

scowl ‘on his face, traverses the party, finds the side of his
friend ARTIE who is overweight, benign and a little drunk.
Wally nods over to Sandy.

WALLY ' oo
You bring him?
ARTIE ‘
Yeah. He was my roommate sophomore
year. I spent a lot of time out in
the hall. ‘

WALLY
What's his deal?

ARTIE
He lives in LA. Works in film.

WALLY
It's a dilettante art-form.

Artie agrees while pondering the ice in his drink.

Wally looks on as Sandy says something that causes Kassie to
flirtatiously exaggerate a laugh.

WALLY
What exactly does he do?

ARTIE
I don’t know -- what do they all
do? He doesn’t really work, still
takes drugs, sleeps with beautiful
women and lives beyond his means.

WALLY
I hate him.

ARTIE
Me too.
‘ '

' WALLY 1
And the French. I hate the French.

Artie nods. Might, agree. As he swirls his drink...

ARTIE
Of course he’s married.
WALLY
What? '
'
ARTIE

But don’t tell Kassie -- I don’ t
' wanna cock-block.

WALLY
Of course I’m going to tell her.
Artie smiles... sly.
ARTIE ‘ '
I know.
AS SANDY

comes in for the kill.

SANDY
I think we should get out of here.

Kassie flirtatiously bites her lip in mock-thought.

KASSIE
I’m not sure...

And Wally sides up to them.

WALLY
Can we get a smoke?

KASSIE
You don’t smoke, Wally.

WALLY
You do. I'11 join you.

She looks at him... reads his urgency.

KASSIE
Sandy, I'll be back in a minute.

Sandy winks at Kassie as Wally leads her off... through
empty bedroom...

18.

an
‘WALLY
He winked. Did you see that?
He actually winked. ‘

And out to the...

BALCONY

Manhattan a carpet of lights beldw. =

' WALLY ' '
He's married.

As Kassie lights up a smoke.

4 KASSIE ,
I know.

an WALLY
You ‘know?
mo
KASSIE
There's a'tan-line where his ring
should be. .

WALLY
Then lose him.

She takes a quick drag, then...

KASSIE
I’m thinking I’m going to do it.

And in jealous mortification...

WALLY
What! Why?

KASSIE
It’s perfect... and I’m pretty sure
I‘m ovulating.

WALLY
But you’re drunk. And this guy.
He's married and he winks and--

KASSIE
He lives in another city so there
will be no strings attached. And
he has good genes.

WALLY
Good genes! He’s an adulterer!

19.
' KASSIE
(correcting)
Nurture not nature.

Wally shakes his head in disapproval. ‘
1

WALLY
It’s cuckoldry... and it’s of ill
turpitude.

KASSTIE
Jesus -- where the fuck do you get

these words, Wally?
1 :
As Wally huffs off back into the party.

WALLY
Ill turpitude, Kassie!

She sucks a staccato drag off her smoke -- shouts out ‘after him.
‘ '

KASSIE
Glass houses, Girlfriend.

He‘s gone. .So Kassie ponders the city below.

She takes a reflective moment. ' Something Wally said
resonates with her... the turpitude thing.

And she comes to a conclusion as she stubs out the smoke.

Kassie heads back for the party... but the door won’t open.
She tries it again... it’s locked.

As she bangs on the door.

KASSIE
Hello! I’m locked out here!

INT. PARTY - SAME

Wally wonders through the party. He turns up the volume on
the stereo as he passes it.

As Wally finds Sandy and pulls him aside.

WALLY
So Kassie had to go.

SANDY
What? Where?

WALLY
To see her dealer. The guy’s
paranoid so she went alone.
(MORE )
WALLY (cont'd)
She‘s picking up some drugs --
ecstacy and I think some viagra.

Sandy raises a brow.

‘ WALLY

Look, she’s a bit of a freak show ‘ '

but great in bed. And she digs noe

you. : :

‘ : ‘ \
SANDY
She digs me? '
As Wally writes something down. 1
WALLY ’ ‘

It’s so on. She wanted me to tell
you that. Those exact words. :

Sandy's eyes, Light up. Wally hands Sandy the slip of paper. +
WALLY . tos '
She wants you to meet you at this
address. , You need to leave right
now. .
EXT. BALCONY - SAME

Kassie bangs on the door... but the music from the party is
too loud for anyone to hear. . '

As she bangs one more time...
EXT. 3RD AVENUE - NIGHT
Furious, Kassie walks quickly. Wally keeping stride.

KASSIE
What did you do, Wally?

WALLY
I sent him to Harlem.

KASSIE
You have no right. I wasn’t even
going to do it.

WALLY
It wasn’t right. It was of il—
you weren't going to do it?

KASSIE
I could never do that... it was
just a fanciful thought that I let

breathe.

She stops and faces him.
!

' RASSIE
But where the hell do you get off,
Wally Mars?

And he blurts out:..

WALLY
Don‘t do it.

KASSIE
You can’t just do whatever you want
because you think you’re right.

4 WALLY ot
Don’t have this kid, Kassie.

KASSIE
You‘re not the moral authority of
life and you’ve got serious impulse
, problems. ;

WALLY
You're acting like those movie
stars who get kids because they
want kids but they don’t want to be
parents.

KASSIE
Don’t tell me what to do!

WALLY
Fine!
(takes a beat, then...)
But don’t do it.

She throws up her arms in frustration.

KASSIE
What is it, Wally? Why does my
wanting a child make you feel so
small?

WALLY
It doesn’t make me feel small.

KASSIE
Then why, Wally? Why is this so
hard for you?

WALLY
Because--

And he stops short.

KASSIE
Why? Because why?
» WALLY
Because if you do this...
everything will change between us
‘ and I'll never see you.

A moment for it to resonate with her. Then...

' WALLY
And because it makes me feel small.

And she looks into his eyes. Sees genuine pain. Softens.

‘ KASSIE
I think it’s best if we take a
break.
He sharply turns away. ‘ ,

a” KASSIE ;
Because ,I’m going to do it, Wally.
I‘m going to have a child.' '
She leans in and kisses his forehead... slow and with care...

KASSIE
I’1l call you when I’m ready.

And she turns... and she goes...
INT. AU MANDARIN - DAY

Wally and Leonard lunch at this upscale Financial District
eatery with a woman in her seventies named MARTHA.

LEONARD
The tax benefits to the foundation
would accrue in a flow-through

situation.
As Wally eats, he quietly moans... making love to his food.
Leonard kicks him under the table. Wally stops.
MARTHA
(cutting through the
bullshit)

I’m willing to commit the liquid
assets right now. Once we sell the
real estate holdings -- those as
well.

Leonard shares a look with Wally. This is big money.
1 ‘

'
' MARTHA
I don’t use the internet but my son
won’t shut up at how well these
stocks are doing. He says I’m
missing the boat.
'
LEONARD
Well, we have access to the
brightest internet and technology
analysts in'the world. '
: '
WALLY
But you should always diversify.

Leonard throws Wally a deadly look.

LEONARD
That's up for debate.' Martha, this
is the new economy... many of the
, old fiscal barometers simply don’t
apply anymore. .
Martha stands.
MARTHA
I’m going to leave the allocation
up to you. Where’s the washroom?

Leonard stands and directs her. When he returns...

LEONARD
What are you doing?

WALLY
I’m sorry, I don’t even realize I'm
doing it... Kassie calls it making

love to my food.

LEONARD
Not that. “Always diversify.”
What is that crap? Do you have any
idea how much more our take is in
the optical and biotech funds?

 

WALLY
It’s a bubble, Leonard.
LEONARD
You don't know that!
WALLY
(exacerbated)

It's a bubble. It’s a bubble.
It’s a bubble.

WALLY

networking, semiconductors and
biotech... : i

foundation. Scholarships and
cancer research... ' '
Martha heads back toward the table. Leonard quietly asserts.

LEONARD
You're pissing me off, Waily.

Under his breath...

WALLY
It’s a bubble.

INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A nice Union Square two bedroom co-op with Southern views.
Tastefully decorated with indirect lighting and framed prints
from recent Met exhibits.

Wally heads in while checking his mail. He stops on a large
envelope and immediately rips it open.

WALLY
You have to be kidding me.

And we see the invitation for Kassie’s “I’m Getting Pregnant”
party... only in New York.

INT. 820 5TH AVE/LOBBY - MORNING

An insanely opulent lobby to one of the most expensive
addresses in the world. In his suit, Wally waits on a couch.

The elevator doors open and Martha emerges with two toy dogs
on leashes. She greets him.
'
MARTHA,
Wally, this is highly unusual.

, WALLY
I know. Thanks for meeting on
short notice. '

MARTHA
Well, you can walk Mitzi and Burt
with me. '
1

EXT. 5TH AVENUE - MORNING

Wally and Martha walk her dogs.

WALLY
My father was an old school broker.
A commission jockey... a relic.

When I was eight years old, he took
me to the local pharmacy.
‘

She’s looks at him -- interested as to where this is heading.

WALLY

He grabbed a can of Barbasol
shaving cream then asked me to ,
predict what would happen to its
price if it were the only one in
the store and everyone in New
Rochelle needed a shave.

(and then)
He must've seen something in me
because most eight year olds
couldn’t grasp the concept of
Keynesian efficiency... but I was
hooked right away. Supply and
demand. It narrowed the world for

me. It was... honest.
And he stops walking, turns to her -- arrives at the point.
WALLY

Martha, what's going on in certain
areas of the market today couldn’t
be farther from efficient or
honest.

She slowly nods. Understanding what he’s trying to tell her.
INT. KASSIE‘S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The party in progress. Think birthday meets Bachelorette.
Nodding hello to a few familiar faces, Wally heads into the

kitchen and fixes himself a drink. He pours it heavy and
sucks it down. Surveying his first and probably only...
27.

I‘M GETTING PREGNANT PARTY

Music. Balloons and baby decorations. Mostly women but some
men. Candles everywhere.

Wally pours himself another drink. Sucks down a large gulp.

And Wally sees Kassie, laughing with a few friends... telling
some story. She catches Wally’s'gaze and holds it for a
beat... then turns back to her group.

: ’
PABLO, Kassie’s rail-thin African American gay friend, joins
Wally's side. : ‘

PABLO
1 Not in the mingling mood, Wally?
. WALLY
No., I’m in the avoiding mood.

'(then)
I’ve counted six women here! that
Kassie set me up with over the last
five years. '
\
PABLO
Aha.

They just stand side by side taking in the party. Until...
WALLY
This whole thing is crazy. A party
for insemination. I mean, who does
that?

PABLO
I think it’s kitchy.

Wally finishes his drink. Then...

WALLY
Gays think everything is kitchy.

As he pours himself another...

WALLY
It’s wrong and it’s induigent.

PABLO
You really need to hear yourself
one of these days, Wally... you're
a poster boy for transparency.

Wally simply lifts his glass to that then downs another gulp.

PABLO
Have you met the donor yet?
' WALLY '
(surprised)
He’s here?

. PABLO
Oh yes.

,AS he goes...
PABLO

(sing song)
And he’s hot...

INT. | PARTY - LATER '

Wally leans against the wall. He’s drunk. A woman in her
late 30's named BECKY faces him.

BECKY
Hi Wally Mars.
+
WALLY
Becky.
BECKY

Still not married I see.

He notices her ring.

WALLY
That’s right, Becky -- you win.

BECKY
I wish my husband were here. I
told him all about you.

WALLY
I’m sure you did.

And she regards him. For a long moment. Then...

BECKY

You weren’t very nice to me.
WALLY

I was honest, Becky. The whole

time.
And he looks over to see Kassie in conversation with someone.

BECKY
Oh -- you're way too late on that
one, Wally.

With that, she goes. Wally takes it in stride. Closes his
eyes in anguish. Then...
‘KASSIE (0.S.)
Is she, still angry?

And Wally opens his eyes to find Kassie in front of him.

WALLY
She’s married now. '
"_ RASSTE Ho

Not happily.

. . ' i)
And she leans against the wall next to him with...

KASSIE
I didn’t know if you'd come.

WALLY |
‘There was a business trip that I 1
was, going on but... here I am.

wh KASSIE , '
‘yy?

With a capitulatory sigh... °

WALLY
Because there wasn’t any business
trip.
KASSIE
I missed you.
He nods.
WALLY
How do you know it’s even going to
work?
KASSIE

I don’t. But my basal body
temperature is raised, my period
was fourteen days ago and my
secretions are luteinized... I’m in
a very follicular place.

He simply shakes his head in disapproval.

KASSIE
What?

As he sucks down the rest of his drink then angrily pulls
away from the wall and heads for the kitchen to refill it...

WALLY
Let’s just say I’m not in a very
follicular place right now.
As she watches him go:
INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Wally sucks down another. Five... six... not sure. |
He turns to be face to face with... '

. ROLAND NILSEN

Tall, long lemon yellow hair, slicing jaw-line, perfect
complexion, big baby blue eyes and a toothy smile of strong
white teeth that he casts onto Wally.

' ROLAND .
Mind pouring me one?

WALLY
Not at all.

Wally pours Roland a drink,and hands it to him.
They stand side by side taking in the party.

Wally zeros in on two guys, both super thin, eating
voraciously off a platter on the dining room table.

WALLY
Look at those shameless
ectomorphs... stuffing their mouths
with refined carbohydrates ...
flaunting their metabolisms.

ROLAND
I can’t eat cheese anymore.

As Wally swigs off his glass...

WALLY
What are they even eating?

ROLAND
It’s a pistou spread served with
crostini.

WALLY
I hate the French.

ROLAND
So do I.

Wally turns to face Roland.

WALLY
You do?

ROLAND
I find them thankless and elitist.
31.

‘WALLY
Yes. That's exactly it.

Wally gmiles and offers a hand.

WALLY ‘
Wally ‘Mars.

Roland shakes his hand. ‘ ,

ROLAND '
Roland Nilsen.

As they both take in the lunacy of the event.

‘ WALLY
Only Kassie would ‘do at this way.
bay ROLAND
Yeah, I,don’t know her well.
(and then)
I’m the donor.

Wally lets it register.

WALLY
I’m um... Wally... Kassie’s best
friend.

ROLAND
Then you’1ll be around to take care
of my kid.

Wally just regards him.

ROLAND
That was of ill-color, I'm sorry.
My wife would kill me if she heard

that.
WALLY
You’re married?
ROLAND
She's right there...
Roland points out his wife across the way... MARIE.
WALLY

She’s beautiful.

ROLAND
Isn't she? She gave up a child for
adoption when she was younger so
she thinks this is fair.

(MORE )
ROLAND (cont'd) :
I don’t particularly see it that
’ way, but...' we need the money.

Wally sucks down another big gulp.

. WALLY '
How much is Kassie paying you?

ROLAND
Thirty thousand. I’m going for a
dual-masters at Columbia. ,

Drunk, Wally looks Roland up and down... this guy is
beautiful, that’s for sure... but also... invitingly benign.

And this kills Wally Mars.
As he glares at this man through rejected drunk small eyes...
WALLY
Roland, did you know that only five
percent of the male elephant Seal '
population gets to mate with ninety-—
three percent of the females?
Roland smiles. Because somehow...

ROLAND
I did.

As Wally sucks in another swig and heads on his way...

WALLY
Good for you.

HALLWAY

Wally waits for the bathroom, turns and finds himself face to
face with...

KASSIE
I thought you left.

He swallows back his anger. Cements his furious gaze onto her.

KASSIE
What the hell is wrong with you,
Wally?

WALLY
(fumbling)
I can’t believe... you... this
is... what...

He can’t get any words out...
- KASSIE
You’re drunk.
WALLY ‘
I mean... how could... I can’t

believe... 1 ,
She’s getting frustrated.

KASSIE
Use your words, Wally! '

And he stops, faces her... calms into a piercing stare.
WALLY ‘
1 Vapid. Insignificant.: Eliminated.
She holds his hurt look. Until... \
Hn :
‘ . _KASSIE :
Holly's sick in there. ' Use the one
off my bedroom.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Wally zips up his pants and flushes the toilet.

There's nothing to wash his hands with so he opens the
cabinet under to the sink to see...

A PLASTIC DISH

closed tight. Officially called a “Semen Bottle.” It looks
like a'small dish that people put baby food in. There’s a
sign on it; “DO NOT TOUCH”. Next to it there’s a turkey
baster next to it and an issue of “Playboy's Girl Of The Ivy
League.”

Wally takes a deep breath, looks at the large breasted woman
on the cover of the magazine then grabs the dish. He lays it
on the sink and opens it.

ROLAND’S SPERM’S POV

looking up at Wally Mars... who looks down at us with pained
squinty drunk eyes.

And we hear...

VOICE OF WALLY MARS
And there you are... commanding
height... lucid blue eyes...
crushes of youth... rows of
straight A’s... first to third
base... permanent parental pride...

AND WALLY

ina fit of anger... in a rush of impulse... in a drunk quick
movement... throws us into the sink --'the barrel of the
faucet staring us down.

VOICE OF WALLY MARS
(threatening) ‘
You don’t look so tough... just a
splash of water... that’s all it
would take... just a... splash...

\ :
And _he turns on the water... which races down at us.

 

And everything...
FADES TO BLACK

VOICE OF WALLY MARS ‘
What did you do, Wally?

FADE BACK IN ON

an anguished Wally Mars. Breathless and sitting on the floor
-- his head buried into his hands.

WALLY
How are you going to tell her?

A long moment. The water splashes about in the sink.
That’s all we hear. Wally is still... a longer moment...
excruciating stillness.

UNTIL WALLY MARS

raises his head... finds his feet... walks over to the
sink... turns it off... a new look on his face... one of
determination... one of concentration... looks down into the
newly washed out dish... turns to make sure the door is
locked... and then unzips his pants.

INT. WALLY'S APARTMENT — LATER

Darkness. Wally sleeps. Then suddenly... he shoots up with
a start.

WALLY
What did I do?!?

EXT. KASSIE'S HELL'S KITCHEN WALK-UP - LATE NIGHT
Wally quietly climbs the steps to Kassie’s brick building and

removes a set of keys. He looks down the street in both
directions like he’s about to rob the place.

i)
INT. KASSIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Darkness. Until, the door knob slowly moves and light spills
in from the hall. Walls heads into the living room
apartment, quietly and carefully.

And Wally tip-toes toward that fateful bathroom to undo. wet
his impulsive crime... but...

KASSIE (0.S.)
What are you doing? ‘

Startled, Wally jumps back. Sees...

KASSIE LARSON

on the couch... in her jammies... with her legs in the air.
tn WALLY So
Jesus! .You scared the hell out of
me.
'KASSIE ,

Oh, I’m sorry I disturbed you'
breaking into my apartment.

WALLY
I didn’t break in. I used the
spare set of keys you gave me.
What are you doing?

KASSIE
They say this helps. Why are you
' here at three in the morning?

WALLY
So, you already... did it.

KASSIE
Yes. Why are you here, Wally?

Good question. Wally takes a beat.

WALLY
I came to talk you out of it.
KASSIE
Not this again.
WALLY
You still can. You can flush it
out.
KASSIE

Flush it out?
'
She leans forward int6 a normal position.

KASSIE
You came here at three in the :
morning to say flush it out?
'

He confirms.

SSIE
Go home, ceny.

WALLY
What are the chances it works?

KASSIE
Because you’re rooting against it?

WALLY
Yes. You don’t understand. I...
‘ Shit... I... 1
She just looks at him. Listening.

KASSIE
You... ?

A long moment. He can’t do it.

WALLY
What are the chances?

KASSIE
Go home.

As he backpedals toward the door.

WALLY
Okay.
And she resumes the fertility position -- legs in the air.
KASSIE
Okay.

But he doesn’t go anywhere. Repeats...

WALLY
What are the chances?

KASSIE
Fifty percent!

Wally thinks about it. Decides he likes the number.

WALLY
Okay. Good night.
He heads for the door. She calls out after him.

KASSIE
Wally?

And he stops and turns.

assets placed in old economy funds.

WALLY
Good for her. She‘ll be safe when
the bubble pops.

LEONARD
You're fired.
WALLY
‘ No, I’m not... you need me.

Leonard takes a seat with a sigh.

LEONARD
I know... but I wanted to say it.

Wally looks at a picture on his desk of he and Kassie on a
beach in the Bahamas... gets lost in it.

LEONARD
Even if it does pop... even if you
did the right thing... the way you
went about it... the arrogance...

Wally’s not listening...

And Wally just shrugs.
EXT. VIVIAN BEAUMONT THEATER - NIGHT

A crowd exits the theater for intermission. The marquee
reads “Susan Stroman’s Contact.” The theatergoers light up
and turn on their cell phones.

Find Wally and Kassie in the mix.

KASSIE
It's not technically a musical.
The recorded music and all. I mean
it’s resonant and moving... just
not a musical.

Wally nods in agreement.
KASSIE

I miss you Wally. How come we
haven’t seen each other that much

lately?
WALLY

I don’t know... I’ve been busy.
KASSIE

Since my party you‘ve been very
unavailable to me.

Wally doesn’t answer her. He just stands there --
thunderstruck and shell-shocked.

Stunned and starring straight ahead, Wally sits on a bench

nursing a water. Kassie has a seat next to him.

KASSIE
You've never been this emotional

suit you...

Wall recedes in thought... aloud...

WALLY
It is best for the kid... isn’t it?
Minnesota. There’s orchards and
plenty of room to play and benign
people who fish and able educators
who aren’t resigned to pass
illiterate children.

A little misty-eyed...

STRIKE PRICE nervously smells the wall. He's a six week old
adorable Portuguese Water Dog.

Wally watches ‘Strike Price from across the way. He smiles
and turns to see that picture of him and Kassie taken in the
Bahamas. And he gets iost in it.

And Wally finally looks back to see his'new puppy’s first
donation to the apartment.

INT, WALLY’'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Strike Price runs full steam ahead and stops... his paws
sliding him across the wood floor. He’s a gorgeous strong
boy of seven, his coat shining... his tongue wagging.
CARD: TODAY

And Strike Price jumps onto the bed. Waking up Wally.

WALLY
Hey buddy.

Strike Price licks his owner voraciously. And seven years
older, Wally now has some gray... just_a little... on the
sides... it looks good. He’s aged well.

The lump next to Wally comes to life. She rubs her eyes.
Her name is PAULINE and she’s cute. Not beautiful but really
sweet with small almond eyes and an accent.

PAULINE
Bon Jour Strike Price...

A French accent. She leans over and kisses Wally.

PAULINE
What’s so bad about falling in love
with you, Wally?

WALLY
I’m not looking for that right now.

She looks down. Hurt. Rejected.

PAULINE
What makes you so special?

I’ve lied to my children. I've
sold information... I’ve pumped and
dumped... I’ve cooked books.

' Great. I know this place on' Bayard
that has the best duck. Does he
like duck?

Wally inadvertently grabs a piece of paper off his desk and
crumples it up. :

KASSIE (0.S.) ’ '
Duck’s fine, Wally.

Wally closes an eye and aims for the trash can across the
way. It’s a pretty easy shot.

WALLY '
This duck is the best. If I get
him a baseball glove will he like
that?

And Wally shoots... and completely misses...

KASSIE (0.S.)
He’s not really that athletic.

WALLY

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY
with Kassie as she’s checking into the Le Meridien hotel.

KASSIE

KASSIE
Yes. It’s weird. He’s weird,

PAULINE
' And how are you, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN
I have cyclothymic disorder.

INT. CANTON RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Sebastian unwraps his gifts -- all picture frames.
With each one, he announces...

SEBASTIAN
Have it. Have it. Oh cool, I
could use another Boom Magna
Lucite...

Wally looks to Kassie who can only shrug.
SEBASTIAN
Have it... Awesome -- a four by six
Lunt Sterling Silver!

That was the last one.
1 ,
!
‘ WALLY \ :
I‘m sure you can return the ones
you already have.

. PAULINE
Think of all the great pictures you
can put in them, Sebastian.

‘and Sebastian shoots her dirty: look.

SEBASTIAN 1
(duh!)
I don’t put pictures in them.

PAULINE
Okay.

Pauline gives Wally a glance. He breaks the moment.

WALLY ,
Do you still go onto Homestar '
runner.com, Sebastian?

SEBASTIAN
Yeah. Strong Bad is so funny.

Pauline rubs her hand through Wally’s hair.

PAULINE
What is this Homestar?

Wally grabs her hand, takes it out of his hair, squeezes it
for a perfunctory beat then lets it go.

SEBASTIAN
Nothing.

KASSIE
They E-mail each other these stupid
cartoon web sites.

SEBASTIAN
They’re not stupid.

The WAITRESS brings a huge platter of roasted duck.

WALLY
Okay, the main attraction. I had
to call to preorder this... it’s
their specialty and it’s the best
duck in the world!

Sebastian blankly looks at the platter.

SEBASTIAN
I can’t eat duck.

w
49.

‘WALLY
What? ,
' SEBASTIAN
Wally, do you know what they do to
the ducks at the waterfowl farms?

KASSIE : :

Sweetie, that was veal! ‘ ' ‘
‘ SEBASTIAN , ‘
No, I read about the ducks ‘too.
KASSIE ‘
I thought I made myself clear about

\ peta.com! .

Kassie already sighs in defeat. Wally looks at her. : \

'

“\ | WALLY ‘ \
What is this? ' so '
\KASSIE ‘
Not good. ' '
SEBASTIAN

They force feed the ducks seven
pounds of food a day through a
plastic tube they drill into their . '

throats.
WALLY
I had to call and specially order
1 this.

They're going to toe to toe. Pauline tries to calm Wally.

PAULINE
C’mon Wally. It’s okay.

SEBASTIAN
The ducks get this liver disease
called hepatic lipidosis and they
can’t walk.

Kassie leans into Sebastian and whispers.

KASSIE
I want you to stop this right now.

WALLY
It costs eighty-four dollars and
it’s one of the most delicious
culinary treats in the world.

Wally stares him down. Sebastian doesn’t budge.
’

' SEBASTIAN,
I won’t do it, uncle Wally... and
I’ll hate you if you do.

The kid is intractable.’ Kassie sighs.
\

KASSIE
He’s stubborn, Wally... maybe more
than you. | :
Wally looks at the sizzling duck: platter.
Then back to Sebastian who simply shrugs.

' SEBASTIAN
I like sushi.

EXT. UNIVERSITY PLACE - NIGHT

Wally and Pauline walk slowly through the village.

PAULINE
The sushi was good, no?

WALLY
Yeah, I mean that duck would've
been better.

She agrees. They walk in silence, until...

PAULINE
Why do you e-mail a little boy,
Wally?

WALLY
What?

PAULINE
It is strange. You would e-mail
Sebastian.

WALLY
No. It’s just...

His thought trails off. They keep walking.
PAULINE
And tomorrow, you are taking off
from work to be with him?
Wally just shrugs.

PAULINE
I’m sorry -- I think it’s strange.

50.

And Wally... just keeps walking... with no answer to that.
51.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY

Wally and Sebastian stand in awe of the PEACOCKS while they
flaunt their impressive plumage.
\
WALLY

Peacocks have always been a bit of
a mystery. ' ot
SEBASTIAN '

I think puppets are a mystery.
Wally regards the boy for a beat, then...

WALLY ,
Yeah. In most other species, the
.females mate with the strongest ,
males but female peacocks mate with
the prettiest. In a sense, peacock
females are more like the males of
most species.

Sebastian points to the peacocks.

SEBASTIAN
Are those males?

WALLY
Yes. It’s evolution. Those
magnificent colors. Do you know
what evolution is, Sebastian?

As they walk through the zoo.

SEBASTIAN
No -- do you know what Parkinson's
disease is?

WALLY
Yes -- there was this guy named

Charles Darwin and he came up with
this theory called natural
selection.

SEBASTIAN

Do you ever get scared that you
could have Parkinson's disease?

Wally ignores the question, continues...
!
' WALLY '

Natural selection basically states

that the females in all breeds mate

with the strongest males and thus

weed out weakness within the

species. '

_ Sebastian looks up at him. Now listening...
WALLY :

But Darwin’s theory was resisted by
scientists across the globe for

years.
'
SEBASTIAN
Why, Wally?
WALLY ‘
Because scientists are by and large
scrawny... and they couldn’t accept

the rejection.

A moment, then...

SEBASTIAN
That was a joke.

WALLY
Yes, Sebastian, it was.

Sebastian thinks about it for a beat, then...
SEBASTIAN
Sometimes a. joke can be funny
without me laughing.
Wally looks down at the boy with easy loving eyes and agrees.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK/PLAYGROUND - DAY

Wally takes it in... a day in the park... with his son.
They swing side by side in silence, until...

WALLY
Sebastian, what do you know of your
father?

SEBASTIAN
I don’t have a father. Mom had me
all by herself. I’m special that

way.
WALLY

But you know -- a man had to be

involved with um... your mother

getting pregnant...
Sebastian stares at his feet as they fly in the air.

SEBASTIAN ‘
Duh...

WALLY '
What do you know about him? The
man that helped your mom get ‘
pregnant. ' ot

Sebastian doesn’t answer. Retreats within a bit.
Wally senses this and doesn’t push.
"SEBASTIAN

Sometimes I get scared'that I have
' Parkinson’s disease. |

WALLY

You, don’t have Parkinson's disease,
Sebastian. .

SEBASTIAN
But I blink too much.

WALLY
Trust me. You don’t have
Parkinson's.
And Sebastian says it so quietly.

SEBASTIAN
I have trust issues.

And Wally admires the boy -- sees himself.
EXT. LE MERIDIEN HOTEL - DAY

Kassie waits at the 57th street entrance of the hotel.
And she sees them before they see her.

WALLY AND SEBASTIAN

walking in a lock step... with the same stride... both of
them completely at ease... Sebastian talking Wally’s ear
off... and Wally truly listening to him.

And Kassie takes this in... this sight... man and boy...
Sebastian now sees his mother, breaks a sprint toward her.

AND KASSIE LARSON

picks up her boy, showers him with kisses, looks up, right
Wally -- eyes connect -~- and she smiles...

AND WALLY MARS

at
\
holds the smile, takes in this, sight -- Sebastian and Kassie
together -- and it registers to him that she’s never looked

more beautiful...
INT. JECKYLL AND HYDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
1

A horror-themed restaurant with costumed creeps and bad food.
_ Sebastian plays a video game across the way while Wally and
Kassie wait for the check.

‘ KASSIE ,
I just thought it was weird because
you hate the French.

WALLY
She’s. great. I’m not sure it will
last but she’s really... great.

As Wally looks over to Sebastian playing the video game.

WALLY | : '
I can’t believe how fast he’s
growing up.

KASSIE
You’re amazing with him. The gifts
and the time you've spent. The
duck thing.
(and then)
The Wally Mars I knew six years ago
wouldn't have given in like that.

WALLY
Well, he’s an incredible kid.

With a smile...
KASSIE
Yeah but... it’s more than that.
You’ve grown up.
And he holds her look with confidence.

WALLY
We both have.

KASSIE
Maybe.

Now they both admire the boy for a beat, then...

KASSIE
I was so arrogant then, Wally. It
was selfish, actually... I wanted a

baby but I didn‘t want a family.
But what I'm learning is... what...
She sorts through her thoughts -~ this is important to her.

KASSIE 1
. I was fearless of rearing but
horrified of love. Truth is -- I

really was only thinking of myself
the way I brought him into this 4 no

world. . . 1
WALLY
But you don’t regret it? |
\ KASSIE
Please -- how could I regret
anything that has to db’with him. ,
' WALLY ‘ ,
.Exactly. : \
KASSIE . \

Let me tell you -- my pathology was '
Narcissistic, I'll admit it. My

romantic head-space was weak, it

was lazy. So yes... everything

that lead to that little boy was

wrong... but something so right

came out of that wrong.

And this resonates Wally into a smile...

WALLY
The ends justified the means.

KASSIE
Exactly.

High off a what feels like a victory, Wally looks around.

WALLY
This place bugs.

KASSIE
Totally.

They share a smile. Sebastian runs over and Wally hands him
another dollar bill before he even asked.

SEBASTIAN
Thanks.

With that... he’s gone.

KASSIE
Jesus, I think I’ve had one too many
Mummy’s Elixirs -- I can’t believe

I’m going to say this.
(MORE )
\ 1
KASSIE (cont'd) +
And it’s not out of weakness,or
' laziness...' but out ,of institution...
out of sentiment... out of biological
and hard-wired need... I want a man,
Wally.
(sums. it up)
I want a man for me and I want a
man for him.

‘and Wally registers this with a slow nod.
INT. TARGET - DAY

Playing hookey from work, Leonard and Wally walk through ‘the
aisles. Every few feet, Wally throws something new into the
cart.

Leonard just looks at him.

WALLY
What?

LEONARD
Are you kidding?

Toys... basketballs...

WALLY '
No. I’m not. I’m not kidding.

LEONARD
I don’t think you fully understand
the situation.

WALLY
Why don’t you explain it to me
then?

... video games... DVDs...

LEONARD
Okay. You’re spoiling your son.
Who doesn’t know he’s your son.
Because his mother never actually
slept with you.

Wally is lost in thought, then...

WALLY
After the male honeybee climaxes,
his genitals explode inside the
female in order to create a
blockage...

LEONARD
Interesting.
As they. make their way to check-out line...
WALLY .
’ Yes, it is. He actually dies for
the sake of this homemade chastity
belt. 1 1

: LEONARD
Wally, do you have a point?
‘ WALLY .
I do. All of this... Darwin...
sperm wars... blood-line battles...
it’s nature... it’s... natural...
'

LEONARD, ;
But we’re not bees.

As they step, pp to the CLERK.

WALLY ' '
The Jordan salamander... Leonard,
the Jordan salamander male will
camouflage himself to look like a
female and then actually have sex
with his rival. And after his
rival is satisfied and has gone off
to produce new sperm, that tricky
salamander will then get with the
female and win the day.

And Wally smiles to the patient clerk then hands her his
credit card.
WALLY
It wasn't his strength or size that
advanced his blood-line, Leonard.
It was his cunning!

LEONARD
It’s a justification.
WALLY
It’s evolution.
LEONARD
Then it‘s an evolutionary
justification.

As he signs the slip, gathers the bags and heads for the
door...

WALLY
All my life I’ve given into
myself... into my emotions... and

I've always gotten away with it.

57.
' ' LEONARD ,
I don’t know what to say.

And Wally stops, turning to his boss... .
WALLY '
I do. I know what you should say.

LEONARD
Okay. Help me out.
\
WALLY
It’s not going to work, Wally. You
' can’t run away from consequence...
nobody can. ‘

LEONARD
That sounds right. ‘

WALLY , ‘ '
The ends don’t justify the means. +

LEONARD
Exactly.

WALLY ,

Honesty will set you:free.

Leonard agrees. They hold the look, until Wally sucks in a
troubled breath, then...

WALLY
And you'd be right.

INT. BEACON RESTAURANT — NIGHT

A midtown restaurant with soft lighting and good fish.
Wally’s nervous. Fidgeting.

Kassie works her wine while talking.

KASSIE
He does it for attention. All the
internet parental control programs
focus on porn. I can‘t find any
that block on medicinal webpages...
it’s ridiculous.

Wally vacantly nods. Not all there.

KASSIE
It was because I was seeing a
doctor in Minnesota. Sweet guy,
didn't feel it. But Sebastian
bonded with him.
(then)
(MORE )
\
KASSIE (cont'd)
That was the worst part of breaking
Se it off. Shit, that’s when I knew I
had to, move back here.

Wally sucks in some air, nervous, readying himself for...
WALLY ‘

Kassie, there’s something I think I
need to confess to you.
1

'
'

Not missing a beat.

' ‘ KASSIE
‘ I know, what it is.

WALLY
I don’t think so., i

, KASSIE ,
Yes, I do... because I feel it too.
'

Wally summons a breath for confidencet ‘And...

. WALLY
The night you threw the part-- feel
what?

KASSIE

It's just since I’ve been back...
oe the way you’ve changed... the way
” you are with Sebastian.

And she takes his hand.

1 KASSIE
That's what you were trying to say.
That you have feelings for me. No?

Overwhelmed, Wally looks at their hands locked in a hold and
doesn’t answer.

KASSIE
I know. I didn’t plan it this way
either. Trust me -- I did not come
back here thinking this would

happen.

And he just looks at her. Not expecting this.
Not knowing how to react...

WALLY
What would happen?

KASSIE
Remember that night in the Bahamas
when we kissed?
\
WALLY 1
No. Not really. I mean, I guess.

. KASSIE
Yes, you do.

Wally removes his hand. He’s somehow now getting angry.

WALLY
We were drunk.

KASSIE
You were a good kisser.

He looks away. Then back... not sure why he’s so upset.

WALLY

This sucks.
KASSIE

Ouch. +
WALLY

I wanted to tell you something
tonight and now...

Stops short. Just regards her.

KASSIE
What? Wally, now what?

WALLY
Now I can’t.

KASSIE
Yes, you can.

WALLY
No. I can’t. Because you're
confusing me.

KASSIE
I’m not trying to confuse you,
Wally, I’m trying to seduce you.
And Wally goes to his feet -- flustered and insecure.
WALLY
I wasn‘t good enough for you seven
years ago but now I am?

KASSIE
That’s not true.

On the defensive... no idea what she’s done wrong...

60.
‘KASSIE
I’m drinking wine. I'm attracted
to you.

WALLY

No you're not., Because I’m not 1
attractive and we both know it.

And he goes.
EXT. 57TH STREET - NIGHT ‘ '
Wally storms down the street. Kassie catches his stride.

KASSIE
You've always been so insecure,
Wally. Like that time the retarded
,guy on the corner called you a
lopsided-faced-asshole.

Still walking. Not looking at her. But correcting...

VWALLY
Potato-head-looking-motherfucker.

KASSIE
Whatever. Stop walking. Wally,
stop walking and look at me.

Now he’s more angry.
WALLY
I can’t believe I have a lopsided
‘ face...

KASSIE
Oh _ my god!

WALLY
You just said it. Lopsided-face-
asshole.

KASSIE
Well the asshole part is true.

And he finally stops and turns to face her.

WALLY
What do you want from me, Kassie?

KASSIE
I want...

With a shrug...
' RASSIE
eee you.

He nods sharply. Listening. Nervous. Angry. Waiting.
: '

KASSIE ‘

You‘re kind and you’re honest and

you‘re funny and you don’t look

like a potato and your face is

symmetrical... ,

: :
She takes a beat, not finished, then...
‘ KASSIE .
And my kid's crazy about you.
And you're incredible with him.
As she moves closer to him. Théir mouths inches apart.

, KASSIE
We were different people back then. '

Silence. The look holds, until... he grabs her.
And he kisses her. Long. Hard. Explosive and unending.

And She has to catch her breath before saying...

KASSIE
That little boy grew me up, Wally.

As they unite in a flurry of baby kisses.

KASSIE
I wasn’t afraid to have
Sebastian... but I was too scared

to have you.
He stops kissing.

WALLY
So, you rather I thought you as
vapid than vulnerable?

She thinks about it for a beat... and confirms with a slight
nod. He falls against the wall with a laugh. His lifetime
frame of inadequacy obliterated in a moment... this moment.

WALLY
I’m blown away.
(and then)
I always thought I wasn’t good
looking enough.

Another kiss... scary good...
| KASSIE
You're beautiful, Wally Mars.

And another. It’s like they’ve been drowning their whole
lives and these kisses are air.

' '
They finally stop. Hold a look.

KASSIE ' 1
I think we need to get out of the
street. ‘
And he’s charged. :
WALLY ‘
1 Jesus.
They both ,are.
my :
' . KASSIE
I know. to
» WALLY
Oh man. '
KASSIE
We should wait -- right?
WALLY
Right. I think so.
KASSIE
Or.
Charged again.
WALLY
Right.
KASSIE
Stop saying right, Wally.
WALLY
Right.
KASSIE
You’re with someone.
WALLY
I’m ending it.
KASSIE
(concerned)

Because of me?
‘ WALLY 1
No. I always end it.

_ KASSIE Y
(sad) ,
So not because of me?

WALLY
I don’t know. Do you want it to be
because of you? :

KASSIE
Only if you want it to be because
' of me. not \
WALLY
Kassie, I don’t know what we’re
saying.
KASSI5, ‘ :

Either do I. : '
Coming to the conclusion.

KASSIE
We should wait. . :

And he looks at her -- draws in a breath. Agrees.

WALLY
We should wait.

She agrees.
KASSIE
Then I have to go right now. Very
quickly. Otherwise--

WALLY
Right.

So she quickly kisses him one more time then runs away in a
little girl skip.

Stunned, Wally just leans against the wall, watches her go
and collects himself.

INT. WALLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Pauline leans against the wall. Tears in her eyes.
Wally sits on the bed... hating this...

WALLY
It’s nobody's fault.
She nods. Wipes a tear.

WALLY ,
‘ It’s just that people are
idealistic -- they want to believe
their relationships are on equal
footing but they rarely are. no
He moves to her, tries to comfort her by placing his hand on
her shoulder but it doesn’t work so he quickly removes it.
: . ' i)
WALLY
There’s always someone with the
power and someone without it. And
when someone falls in love, they
\ give up their power...,and the
imbalance ends up killing the whole ,
thing.

And she looks"up with...

‘ roa

PAULINE
You're very egotistical, Wally
Mars. .

WALLY
I know.

PAULINE

And you're very insecure.
He agrees. Gives her that.
. PAULINE
I didn’t think I could meet someone
who could be both.

And then...
PAULINE
And I sure as hell didn’t think I’d
fall in love with him.
INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - LATER
Wally sadly looks out the window... on the phone...
WALLY
She said I was both egotistical and
insecure.
with...
KASSIE

Folding Sebastian’s laundry.
RASSIE
You are.

(then)
Was it hard?

And he takes to a pace...

WALLY
It always is. There were times
that I thought she might be falling
in love with me but I never really
believed it.

1 KASSIE so
That's because you don’t think you
can be loved, Wally.

And he stops walking. Allows that to hang in silence.
Until...

KASSIE : '
I’m sorry -- I shouldn’t have said
that.

Wally thinks for a moment. Then...

WALLY
Kassie?

KASSIE
Yes.

WALLY

What's Sebastian doing tomorrow?

INT. WALLY’S OFFICE - DAY

Sebastian and Wally sit on the couch eating ice cream.
Strike Price at their feet... concentrating for any spillage.

Sebastian is completely fixated on the large electric ticker
that wraps around the office.

SEBASTIAN
What are all those letters?

WALLY
They represent companies,
Sebastian. I make money by buying
at one price and selling them at a
higher one.

SEBASTIAN
Do you know what all those letters
mean?
» WALLY
Most of them.

Sebastian finishes his cone. Chocolate lice cream smeared all

over his face.

t
SEBASTIAN
?
How? \ /

WALLY
How do you know about all those
picture frames, Sebastian?

As Strike Price jumps on his lap and licks up the ice cream.

SEBASTIAN
I dunno... it’s in my head. ,
WALLY ‘
Same thing.

SEBASTIAN
Does everybody have, as much room in
their heads as we. do, Uncle Wally?

And with a proud smile...

WALLY
No.
And Sebastian -- his eyes fixated on the ticker.
SEBASTIAN

' But what makes them go up and down?
INT. 200 BROAD STREET/GIFT SHOP - DAY

NAHRA, the Pakistani owner of the shop, pets Strike Price
while Wally indoctrinates Sebastian.

WALLY
Okay, see all those cans of
Pringles... let's say the store

only had one can. And let's say
everyone in the building decided
they were hungry for Pringles.
What would Nahra do?

SEBASTIAN
Sell the can to the first person
that came in the store?

WALLY
Let's say fifty people came at the
same time... all wanting that one
can.
1 '

'
Sebastian looks to Nahra... then back at Wally.

SEBASTIAN

Ask for more money?

. : '
WALLY ‘

Exactly. That's called demand.

When there is demand... the price

goes up. Now. let’s say nobody
wanted the Pringles. and Nahra had a
hundred cans. How would he sell
them?

1 SEBASTIAN
But nobody wants them.

WALLY
Let‘s just say they kinda wanted
them but didn’t really care.
Sebastian thinks about it for a moment,’ then... ‘
SEBASTIAN .
He'd lower the price. Or give them
away if someone bought something
else.
Wally smiles proud.

WALLY
That’s called supply.

Sebastian lets the complexity of it register.
WALLY
That's the basic idea of price
fluctuation.

Sebastian thinks for a beat, a deep thought, then...

SEBASTIAN
Wally?

WALLY
Yeah...

SEBASTIAN

Can I have a can of Pringles?

Wally takes a can to the counter while Nahra hands Strike
Price back to Sebastian. As Nahra returns to the counter...

NAHRA
You have a very smart son.

Wally starts to correct him but defers to say...

Sebastian nods. A long moment... until he asks...

SEBASTIAN

Are you my father?

Wally looks down to the kid... who looks back up with big
questioning eyes.

WALLY
No, Sebastian... I’m not.

Sebastian simply nods, inhales his sandwich then washes it
down with a Dr. Brown’s. Wally smiles... delighted at
Sebastian’s appetite.

INT. WALLY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Wally looks in the mirror intently. He’s dressed very nice.
He squints ardently to make sure he looks just right.

And something else... he’s a little nervous.

Excitedly, Strike Price runs up to him, sets to jump...

Kids are cruel. :

And Wally takes this in. And it really seems to bother him.
As she thinks for a moment, then... .

Anything.

She stops short and lightly laughs to herself. ‘

No. It’s embarrassing.

WALLY
Because I've never done anything
embarrassing in front of you...

Good point. Blushing, she leans forward and asks...

KASSIE
Okay, does it get bigger when you
get older?

WALLY
What?

KASSIE
Well, Sebastian. His... you
know... thing. I’m worried it's
smaller than it should be.

WALLY
Jesus.

Covering her face in mortification.
‘KASSIE

I know. Maybe it’s his age.

WALLY

I think so. ' mo
KASSIE ' 1 '

Well, did yours grow?

WALLY

You mean more than the rest of my

body?

Blushing, she confirms. Wally suddenly becomes very
concerned as well as nervous.

Le WALLY / '
You have to understand -- the
difference in size between default
and erect can be substantial.

KASSIE . | '
Default and erect? Why are you
talking like a scientist?

WALLY
(defensive)
I’m just saying it shouldn’t be
judged without the blood.

KASSIE
1 Without the blood?

He’s now sweating.
WALLY
Yes. It’s a completely different
beast.
This is excruciating... Kassie can’t take it anymore.
KASSIE
Know what -- forget I asked. I’m
sure it’s fine.
Pale as a ghost, he nods. She looks over the menu.

KASSIE
Oh -- they have dorado.

Wally just stares blank ahead... disturbed.

WALLY
Excuse me.

moment, then... speaking into it.

LEONARD
It’s fine.

Standing at the sink...

WALLY
Fine? Just fine.

LEONARD
‘ Yes. Wally. Normal.

A guy steps up to the sink and washes his hands.

WALLY
Know what -- that wasn’t erect.
You should see it erect.

Wally half-smiles to the guy at the sink then turns away.

WALLY
I’1ll get erect.

LEONARD
Wally! Listen to me. It’s of
normal size.

WALLY
Okay.

LEONARD
And don't worry about the kid...
mine was on the small side at his
age and you’ve seen it now.

No, I haven't.

standing’ at their table... someone talking to Kassie... and
as he approaches, Wally Mars realizes who that someone is.

WALLY
Roland,

And it is... Mr. Alpha Sperm himself. Seven years later and.
looking even better that he did then.' '

Roland doesn’t recognize Wally.

‘

WALLY
1 Wally. We've met, at the pregnancy
party. .
ROLAND ‘

Right. How are you?
, ros
Wally just nods and has a seat. Roland looks at Kassie.
ROLAND -
You look great, Kassie. Minnesota
was good for you.

KASSIE
I‘m working at CBS now.

ROLAND
Kyle Ford told me it was a boy.

She slowly nods. A little uncomfortable.

KASSIE
How's Marie?

ROLAND
I hear she's fine.

KASSIE
Oh... Roland.

ROLAND
It's okay. Amicable. Woman marry
believing their husbands will
change; men marry believing their

wives won't and well -- they’re
both wrong.
He smiles with resign -- at peace with this.

Kassie returns the smile. And it’s not out of sympathy.
Wally catches the exchange.

His name’s Sebastian.

‘Does he look'like me?

And Wally chimes in.

WALLY
No. '

WALLY

No! I’m sure Roland is here with
people, Kassie.
ROLAND
Actually, since jthe divorce, I’ve
learned to eat alone without ‘shame. 4

WALLY .
You know. Roland... sometimes
there is actual value to the
emotion of shame.
(a beat)
It keeps animals with their herd so
they don't get attacked.

Roland regards Wally for a beat. Then...

ROLAND
Right. I’1ll um... leave you both
to your meal.

KASSIE
Are you sure?

ROLAND
Yes. Enjoy.

He kisses her on the cheek, nods to Wally and heads on his
way. Kassie sits back down.

WALLY
(imitating Roland)
“Women expect change and men don’t
and they're both wrong.” What does
he -- practice that enlightenment
in the mirror?

KASSIE
You were rude.

Wally simply shrugs. Severely upset.
EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - NIGHT

They walk in silence. Wally is clearly upset.
Kassie cuddles up to him.

KASSIE
So... where to now?

And in self-imposed rejection.

KASSIE ' fot
And... well, when we went through

WALLY
What does that have to do with
anything? Everyone has a crush on
him -- have a crush on him.

KASSIE
Every time I see my son, I’m forced
to think about him.

Wally swallows his world.

WALLY
But what about us?

KASSIE
I'm confused Wally. Aren’t I
allowed to be confused?

WALLY
No! Because you have a son! And
people with children waive their
right to confusion.

KASSIE
That’s the thing that makes this so
difficult, Wally. Roland is
Sebastian’s natural father.

And now Wally swallows his tongue.

' KASSIE

I’m not saying I don’t want to see

you anymore... or that I'm

He won't leave his room.

And she bangs on the door.

She bangs on the door.

KASSIE

cried.
KASSIE

I can’t believe this...

You need to go to school!
(to Wally)

You need to go to work.

WALLY
Did he?

As she repeatedly bangs on the door.

It wasn’t about the atrocities, it
was about a little girl who builds
a boat.

Wally rolls his eyes.

Wally doesn’t answer.

SEBASTIAN (0.S.)
Yes I can.

WALLY
Did you kiss him back?

And she’s had it. As she storms down the hall.
KASSIE
Both of you children are driving me
crazy!

And she slams her bedroom door behind her.

Wally has a seat on the floor with a sigh. He leans back

against the wall and throws his head in his hands.
in frustration. That didn’t go well.

A moment, then Wally looks up to see...
SEBASTIAN
standing in his doorway, looking down at him.

mouthful of nicotine and shrugs.

He’s me, Leonard. He's me and he’s

my stubbornness -- he’s her big
brown eyes and her dry unabashed
humor.

Leonard just looks at him. Caring...

I dunno. She went with Roland.

Wally sharply nods with a little wince then looks over to the
kitchen where JANICE, the 17 year old baby sitter, sits. She
vacantly listens to her iPod and stares off into the distance.

Wally steps back into the living room andisniffs a little
more. And it dawns on him. .

As Janice goes into the kitchen and gathers her stuff.

SEBASTIAN
What’s maliciously mean, Wally?

WALLY
With malice. Spiteful. Hateful.

SEBASTIAN
What's baked on hydro?

Wally has no answer for that, so he asks...

just below your chin. » Your
shooting hand should be here and
your non-shooting hand should be...

Right... like so. Now lock your
wrist_and cock it back. See those
wrinkles on the back of your wrist?

Sebastian nods.

WALLY | : ’

That’s good. You always want to

see those right before you shoot.

Now when you shoot, be sure you're
releasing upward and toward the

basket. The shot should feel like

it comes off your fingers not your

hand. Now in the follow through...

you need to visualize literally

putting your hand into the basket.

Wally steps back.

WALLY
Give it a shot.

Sebastian does. Not even close. He sadly looks down to his
feet. As Wally chases down the ball.

WALLY
You need to Practice. Look at me.

And Wally walks very far back. Three point range.
WALLY
I practiced every day... even in

And nails the shot. All net. Sebastian smiles.

INT. KASSIE‘S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The kitchen’s a disaster area. Flour everywhere.
Pots and. cookie trays scattered about.

The lights are all off. Covered in flour and cookie dough,
Strike Price goes to town on the bowl across the way.

Basking in the blue glow of the television set, Wally washes
down a cookie with a swig of whiskey. Pours a fresh glass.
He’s drunk and watching “Carnal Knowledge.”

The movie ends. Wally sighs. He takes another swig and
turns around to see... on the couch behind him...
SEBASTIAN '

awake, feet dangling off the couch, a little confused. ‘

. WALLY
Holy shit. You’re supposed to be
in bed.

‘Sebastian just shrugs,

' WALLY
How long have you been there?

' SEBASTIAN '
Since Jonathan and Susan had sex,
(and then)
What’s a ballbuster?

Wally just looks at the kid. Then...

WALLY |
Okay, you're going to have to learn
it all eventually. A ballbuster is a
woman who backhandedly manipulates a
man into doing things he doesn’t want
to.

Sebastian lets it register. Then asks...

SEBASTIAN
Why did Susan have sex with
Jonathan when she was Sandy's
girlfriend?

Wally ponders his response. Sucks down a big swig.

WALLY
Because Sandy was decent, he was
nice. And some women view that as
weakness and women aren‘t attracted
to weakness. And Jonathan was
kinda mean but very sure of himself
and he was aggressive.

94.

Then...

Wally grabs a cookie and takes a bite. As he chews...

WALLY
See Sebastian, it’s the hypocrisy
of femininity and it’s rooted in
deep psychological and evolutionary
protocol. Women claim they want a
nice guy. They claim they want a
funny guy. A decent man who is
sensitive to their needs.
95.

' SEBASTIAN
Like Sandy.

WALLY
Exactly -- Art Garfunkel. But
they’re lying., They don’t know
they're lying and they don’t mean
to lie, because they believe it
themselves. But what most women
really want is a tall man. A tall
man who is confident and who is,a
little mean to them. Like:
Jonathan. :

SEBASTIAN '
1 Why Wally? :

Good question. Wally takes a moment to sort his answer.

‘WALLY
Maybe because thousands of iyears
ago the tall men fought off
invaders from other tribes while
the nice short men cowered in the
caves telling jokes. Maybe because
people are attracted to what
rejects them and reject what is
attracted to them.

SEBASTIAN
Is Roland mean to my mom?

Wally thinks about it. And honestly assess...
WALLY
No. Roland is actually a good guy.
It’s just that Roland is tall. And
tall is the most important thing to
women. And Roland’s beautiful.
(a long moment, then...)

And I’m not.

SEBASTIAN
Am I going to be tall, Wally?

Wally sadly shakes his head.

WALLY
No.

SEBASTIAN
Then women will never love me?
' WALLY 1
You’11 make a lot of money. And
you'll be funny. And you’1l be
really smart.

Sadly. Quietly.

SEBASTIAN
But they won’t love me because I'm
short. .

WALLY

Maybe not. I don’t know. It feels
that way sometimes. not

Sebastian thinks about it. The perceived iniquity of it all.
And he says...

SEBASTIAN
' Ballbusters!

And Wally agrees.

Wally’s eyes go wide.

KASSIE
He got that from you, didn’t'he?
Making love to his food.

WALLY
' (horrified)
I’m not sure I understand what you
mean...

KASSIE
Well, he didn’t do it in Minnesota
: so he must’ve saw you do it and
followed suit.

WALLY
Right. Of course. Yes, that’s it.
I noticed it when it happened.

KASSIE
But why on earth would you tell him
he would get Parkinson’s Disease?
(confused and shaken)
Why Wally?

Wally thinks about it for a beat.

WALLY
Because it’s my tick. I’m very
protective of my unique traits. He
stole it. It wasn’t right.

Best he could do.

KASSIE
That’s mature, Wally. Threaten a
hypochondriacal child with
Parkinson's disease. Tell him
women are beasts who only love tall
men. Show him provocative Jack
Nicholson films from the seventies.

WALLY
Well, you weren't exactly around,
were you?

You're jealous. You feel
inadequate. : '
(and then)
Truth jis, Wally, I don’t know
what's going on. The whole time I
was with Roland... I missed you.
You Wally. Short you.; Retarded
you. Imperfect you. '

WALLY '
Really? |

KASSIE
But to take out your insecurities
on my child.

WALLY
That’s not what it was...

KASSIE
Then tell me what it was, Wally.

WALLY
We live ina jaded world, Kassie.
And Sebastian’s going to need to
learn feminine hypocrisy early and
often if he plans to survive. He's
not tall or blond, Kassie. He
doesn’t have Roland’s eyes or smile
and he’s never going to. There’s
so much he needs to know. He needs
to develope an outside shot and he
shouldn’t ever play the piccolo.
And there’s more... so much more...

She opens her mouth to argue but he keeps going.

WALLY
I lived it and trust me -- I know
what‘s in store for that kid more
than you know.

He finishes. Kassie doesn’t say anything. She allows it to
resonate, gives it thought, then says...

KASSIE
You have no right.

She sadly looks to her feet... then back up with conviction.

no control.

EXT. UNION SQUARE - DAY

A cold November rain pounds the city. Umbrellas dot the

Find Wally’s building and climb it. To his window... go
inside...

lonely. And reverse back out the window, where...

SNOW

now falls lightly onto the Square. Christmas lights
everywhere. Time is moving.

INT. TOJI SUSHI - NIGHT

The frosted window reveals a snow storm outside. Kassie,
Sebastian and Roland enjoy a fine platter of sushi.

Roland holds a piccolo... explaining...

ROLAND
The guy at the store told me never
play it in the cold. It’s bad for
the instrument.
‘ 101.

While inhaling his sushi...

SEBASTIAN
So I shouldn’t play it outside.

ROLAND '
That's right. And you warm it
gradually by placing it in contact
with your body or hands.

Sebastian nods while eating. - Immersed inithe meal. And
moaning.

ROLAND

Also, gently blow warm air into the

1 instrument before, playing.

Kassie seems lost. Looking out the window into the snow

storm. Sebastian’s moans grow louder. 1

KASSIE ' tos
Sebastian stop that!
SEBASTIAN '

KASSIE
Making love to your food.
SEBASTIAN

And Roland just regards her. Confused at her anger.

Wally rings in the new year with some co-workers. He hugs
Leonard. Both are a little drunk. Balloons fly about.

LEONARD

colleague.

LEONARD
You know, Wally... you need to meet
someone.

ROLAND
I have a confession to make.

KASSIE 1
Okay.

Shoes off, wine in hand, Kassie sits close to Wally.

Just like that?

Do something... react. ' It’s why I
came here. To tell you that. I

was nervous. 1

WALLY
I’m happy for you. I’m crushed...
but happy for you.

She stands up and goes to the window. Looks out of it while
she speaks.

KASSIE

Roland's perfect. And he’s

, Sebastian’s natural father and I
want a traditional family. And
maybe it’s not love but it’s like
and life isn’t about soulmates...
it’s about family and fathers
taking their sons to ballgames...
even if Roland hates ballgames.

And she turns back to face Wally.

KASSIE
Will you kiss me?

WALLY
No.

She walks to him. Speaks quietly. Her mouth inches from his.

KASSIE
I want to sabotage my engagement
and I want to be with you, Wally.
I want to give into my emotions.
, 104.

He s'imply regards her' and coldly says...

WALLY
I don’t do that anymore.

He looks to his feet. Allows the moment to pass.
Allows her to gain her head... her reason.

KASSIE
You're right. .

I never thought you’d be the clear-—

don’t you come? . '

WALLY
I'm going out of town on business.

They both know that’s bullshit.

Sebastian would love to see you.

WALLY

He has Roland now. Roland will be

a great father to him.
She accepts that. And she leaves.
EXT. 14TH STREET ~ NIGHT
It pours. And it’s late at night. Wally walks the streets
alone. Sad. In thought. He gets to the light.at 8th

That crazy homeless man with Tourettes. Mets Hat now wears a
Yankees Hat and looks at a Hasidic man trying to hail a cab.

INT. KASSIE’S APARTMENT - DUSK

Wearing a beautiful dress, Kassie primps in her mirror. She
looks at her own reflection. A trace of uncertainty washes
across her face. But before it takes hold...

SEBASTIAN (0.S.)
Mom.

She turns to see Sebastian looking adorable in a suit.
His tie on completely wrong. As she bends down to fix it.

KASSIE
Baby, hold still.

SEBASTIAN
Is Roland going to be my father or
step father?
She stops working the tie. Looks at her son. Decides it’s time.

KASSIE
Roland is your father.

The Sydney Rothman Center for

provide vital work toward the study

The party in full swing. Drinks being served. Jazz plays.
Martha, a little drunk, grabs Wally’s arm.

MARTHA
You know everybody has you to thank
for this.
They stroll arm and arm.

WALLY
That's not true.

They arrive at the model. She looks down lovingly at it.
MARTHA
Oh, it is, Wally. If you didn’t
risk your job and warn me of the

Wally looks to the complex. Smiles.

MARTHA ‘
That doesn’t diminish what you did.
Honesty is a tricky thing, Wally.

When we have nothing to lose is
when it has most of its power.

Martha leans in, gives Wally a peck on the cheek and greets
some wealthy older couple.

Wally looks at the model. Gets lost in it. And something
washes over him. :

The last time, Wally has this look determination was when we

left him to jerk off in Kassie’s bathroom.

Emotional, Kassie listens. Wally leans down next to her.

KASSIE
Wally, what are you doing?

RAY
And she said... “Will I get married
like you and mommy one day...”

WALLY

I have to talk to you.

KASSIE
Hello! A little busy here!

Sebastian looks over.

SEBASTIAN
Hey Wally.

WALLY
Hey Sebastian.

RAY
And I said; “of course you will.”
And she looked up at me and asked;
“But can I marry you?”

Sweet sighs from the room. Roland sees Wally and gives
Kassie an inquisitive look. She just shrugs.

' WALLY

I'm not here to make a toast as
much as a confession. I have
something to confess, Kassie.
You're not going to like it but it
has to be told. Not because'I
think you're going to forgive me or
choose me or anything like that...
it's just... I don't know... time.

Kassie opens her mouth to object, but...

She fumes... but closes her mouth.

WALLY (CONT'D)

I was drunk and I was hurt. It
wasn't just me you were
rejecting... it was my DNA. You
were passing on my lineage, you
were essentially placing my
ancestors in the friendzone. And
for whom? A stranger.

(he points to Roland)
Okay, I know he's perfect, I know
his sperm is alpha and tall and the
foundation of every schoolgirl's
crush. And I can't even hate
him... which makes me hate him.
And you know my impulse problem and
I was drunk and I was angry. And
none of these are excuses... they
just are what they are.

And Kassie... utterly confused... now standing...

KASSIE
Wally -- what are you saying?

WALLY
I hijacked your pregnancy, Kassie.
I took matters into my own hands.
I replaced Roland's... offering...
with mine. In the bathroom. That
night. Your party. I unzipped my
pants and I thought about the way
you looked in the Bahamas... the
night we fell into that drunken
kiss... I thought of your glowing

wrong -- so wrong. And I know the

something so right... even though

And when someone does something
unforgiveable, maybe... well

Wally doesn’t.

His ability to hold strong... his

into the pool. He lied. Flat out
lied to serve himself. And I
caught him And I really let him
have it. Shouted at him. “You
can't always do what jou want just
because you want to. “The ends
