also told me all about this girl Tony's

me that the apartment in question is

It is a tiny, two hundred and fifty seat theater.
Actually, it is the basement of a church.

On stage, a group of actors sit in a semi-circle
facing a table behind which sits the director.

They all have paper back copies of their scripts.
"Richard ILI". The director, MARK BODINE, is in
his mid-thirties, unkempt, thick glasses, very
scholarly and genuinely obnoxious. If you were an
actor, he is the last person you would want to work
with. He knows it all. Elliot sits on the end,
listening intently. We pick up the session mid-way.

MARK
«.Now then, what about Richard?...
The question is, and this may seem
perfunctory, was Richard actually
deformed? Historically, we know
‘that he was born with a severe curv-
ature of the spine, giving the im-
pression that he was hunch backed.
There was some paralysis of the
left hand and right Foot... Olivier
chose right hand and left foot, God
only knows why..,and nerve damage
to the right cheek and eyelids...
I mean, the man was your basic gimp,
let's face it. Which brings us,
bless the wise and rich Mrs.
Estelle Morganweiss, to this pro-
duction. Is that how we want to
play Richard?... If you do, this
director would prefer to do a six
week scint on the Sonny and Cher
show... Richard the Third was a

not going to put down two shillings
to see a bunch of pansies jumping
around the stage. No, kids, it was
society that crippled Richard and not
childbirth. I mean read your text.
He sent those two cute young boys up
to the tower and no one ever saw them
again. We know why, don't we?...What
I want to do is strip Richard bare --
metaphorically. Let's get rid of the
hump. Let's get rid of the twisted
extremities and show him as he would

The company all look at each other, mumbling. Elliot
seems the most concerned. He raises his hand.

Yes?

ELLIOT
Question...Are you serious?

MARK
What's your objection, Elliot?

ELLIOT
Well, number one, I have to play it.
Number two, I like the hump and the
club foot. And number three, I've
been working on it for three months.

Elliot glares at Paula, then back to attending Lucy.

Deep breaths now...Slow, deep

Come here.
Paula crosses to bed. He motions for her to sit on
other side of bed. She does.

ELLIOT (continuing)
Watch this!

With the flat palm of his hand, he makes gentle,
soothing circles on Lucy's stomach.

ELLIOT (continuing)
You think you can do that?

Lmight be able to manage it.

She makes the gentle circles om Lucy's stomach.

He leans back on the bed and begins to softly play

his guitar...Paula, still rubbing, watches skepcically.

Lucy moans softly. He keeps playing and we see Lucy
starting to relax...Her hands unclench...
