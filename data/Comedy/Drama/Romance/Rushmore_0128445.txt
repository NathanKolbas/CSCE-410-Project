12.may.97
INT. CLASSROOM. CAY

A private day schoci. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in
desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform,
jight blue shirts and khakis. Tne boys look dazed and sleepy.

The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room,
finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard.

MR. ADAMS
Except when the value of the x co-
ordinate is less than or equal to
the value of the -- Yes, Isaac?

A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand.

ISAAC
What about that problem?

Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge
numbers and strange symbols filling-up a forgotten corner of
the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit.

MR. ADAMS
Oh, I really just put that up there
as a joke. That's probably the hard-
est geometry equation in the world.

ISAAC
How much extra credit is it worth?

MR. ADAMS
Well. I've never seen anyone get it
right before, including my mentor Dr.
Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone
here can do it,
(pause)
I'll make sure none of you ever have
to open another math book again for
the rest of your lives.

There is some quiet murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated

over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the
back row.

Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer
with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore repp tie
knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back.
He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER.

Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the
Wall Street Journal.

MR. ADAMS
Max? You want to try it?

Max looks up.

MAX
I'm sorry. Did someone say my name?

Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer
and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and
takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work.

The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares
Max's progress with the notes in his book. Max's equation
quickly fills-up most of the board. He finishes it with a
flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns
to face the class.

Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He
nods .

The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone

surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk.
They hoist him into che air.

CUT TO:

Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the
applause. He mutters: .

MAX
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his
eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK

CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with nearly white hair. Max looks
around.

They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school
uniforms. Dirk puts his finger te his lips.

DIRK
Shh.

Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies
down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker,
HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone.

Mr. Blume is a tough-looking guy about fifty years old ina
black suit. He begins his chapel speech.

MR. BLUME
You guys have it real easy. I never
had it like this where I grew up.
But I send my kids here. Because
the fact is, whether you ceserve
it or not: you go to one of the
best schools in this country.

Max's eyes light-up.

MR. BLUME
Rushmore. You lucked out.

Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen
intently.

MR. BLUME
Now for some of you it doesn't matter.
You were born rich and you're going
to stay rich. But here's my advice to
the rest of you: take dead aim on the
rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs.
And take them down.

Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other
with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on
the flypage of a hymnal.

INSERT HYMNAL:

Rushmore -- best school in country.
rich kids -- bad?

MR. BLUME
Just remember: they can buy anything.
But they can't buy backbone. Don't
let them forget it. Thank you.

Mr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads
the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up.

EXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY

Mr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the
chapel among the throng of students.

Dr. Guggenheim wears 4 wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is
very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing
manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back.

Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Are you free for graduation, Herman?
Maybe you could give us an encore.
(whistles to the dogs)
Nicholas! Copernicus!
MR. BLUME
(lighting a cigarette)
I don't give a shit. I paid for the
whole damn natatorium. The least these
little pricks can do is hear me out.

MAX
Mr. Blume.

Max has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him.

MAX
My name’s Max Fischer. I just wanted
to tell you, I strongly agree with
your views concerning Rushmore.

MR. BLUME
You don't say. Tell me something.
How long have you gone here?

MAX
Ten years.

MR. BLUME
Then you've been in a dreamworld
for ten years.

MAX
I know it, sir.

Max smiles broadly. They each notice that their haircuts are
identical, neatly parted on the side.

MAX
Your speech was excellent. Except
I disagree with your ideas about
rich kids. Because. After all, we
don't choose whe our fathers are.
But that's really my only criticism.

MR. BLUME
(hesitates)
Thank you.

Mr. Blume looks at Dirk staring up at him. Dirk says softly:

DIRK
Hello.

MAX
This is my chapel partner, Dirk
Calloway.
MR. BLUME
(gfiakes Dirk's hand)
Nile to meet you, Dirk.

MAX .
Thank you for coming today, sir.

Max shakes Mr. Blume's hand. Mr. Blume smiles. But Max
doesn't go. He just stands there. Searching for the words.

MAX
I really. I think it's. You're
right about Rushmore. Look around.
It truly is a great school.

Mr. Blume nods. A little uneasy.

MAX
Anyway. Nice to have met you.

Max goes. Mr. Blume and Dr. Guggenheim watch him walk away
with Dirk.

MR. BLUME
What's his name again?

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Max Fischer.

MR. BLUME
He's a sharp little guy.

Dr. Guggenheim looks across the lawn at Max and ‘1s chapel
partner. He says wistfully:

DR. GUGGENHEIM
He's one of the worst students
we've got.

INSERT COVER OF THE RUSHMORE YEARBCSK:

It is called the Rushmore Yankee. The masthead says Max is
editor-in-chief. There is a photograph of him laughing,
surrounded by his staff.

We cut to a series of pictures of:

The French Club, Debate Team, cross-country, lacrosse, golf,
drama, Astronomy Society, Glee Club, student council, Model
United Nations, Stamp & Coin Club, Gun Club, Bombardament
Society, calligraphy, fencing, kung fu, beekeeping, and J.V.
water polo.

Max is president or captain of virtually every one of these.
Other photographs show Max pole-vaulting, dancing at the
Christmas Ball, and giving a thumbs-up from the cockpit of a
Piper Cub.

TITLE:

September.
INT. DR. GUGGENHEIM'S OFFICE. DAY

A panelled room with wooden floors, an old electric fan in
the windowsill, and paintings of ducks and geese on the
walls. Dr. Guggenheim is seated at his little oak desk. Max
sits across from him in an antique leather armchair.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
We're putting you on what we call
sudden death academic probation.

MAX
(pause)
And what does that entail?

DR. GUGGENHEIM
It entails that if you fail another

class you're going to be asked to
leave Rushmore.

MAX
I see.
(raises an eyebrow)
In other words, I'll be expelled.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Right.

Silence.

MAX
Dr. Guggenheim. I don’t want to
tell you how to do your job. But
the fact is no matter how hard I
try I still might flunk another
class. And if that means I have to
stay on for a post-graduate year,
then so be it. But if --

DR. GUGGENHEIM
We don’t offer a postgraduate year.

MAX
Well. We don't offer it vet.
(pause)
And what about the fact that I'm
Probably dyslexic?

DR. GUGGENHEIM
You're not dyslexic.

MAX
Well, I'm a terrible speller.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Just bring up the grades.

Max sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly:

MAX
You remember how I got into this
school?

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Yeah, I do. You wrote a play.

MAX
That's right. A little one act. And
my mother read it and felt I should go
to Rushmore. And you read it and you
gave me a scholarship, didn't you?

Dr. Guggenheim nods.

MAX
Do you regret it?

DR. GUGGENHEIM
No, I don't regret it. But I still
might have to expel you.

Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers:

MAX
Couldn't we just let me float by?
For old times’ sake?

DR. GUGGENHEIM

(grimly)
Can't do it, Max.

EXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY

Max and Dirk come out the door into the cold. They head
across the grass.

MAX
They want to kick me out, Dirk.
DIRK
(concerned)

Oh, no. Not again. What are you
going to do?

MAX
The only thing I can do. Try to
pull some strings with the admin-
istration, I guess.

DIRK
(pause)
Maybe you ought to get a tutor.

MAK
I don't have time for a goddamn
tutor. You know my schedule.

INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:

BACKGAMMON CLUB.
Founder: Max Fischer.

INT. LIBRARY. DAY

A long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a
library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also
playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX.

ALEX
Did you hear they're teaching
Japanese next year?

MAX
That’s the rumor.

ALEX
And they’re cancelling Latin.

MAX
What? I tried to get Latin cancelled

for five years. It's a dead language.
I'd always say.

ALEX
Well, they finally heard you.
Max shakes his head as this sinks in.
MAX

At least I saved Dirk from the
horror.
Max turns the page of his book, There is a little note
written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the
text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it.

INSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK:
which reminds me of a quote from

Henry James: Try to be one of the
people on whom nothing is lost. I

Max's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His
eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex.

MAX
Who's Henry James?

ALEX
I don't know.

Max looks back at the book. He studies the quote. He gets up

and goes to the check-out counter. He shows the book to the
LIBRARIAN.

MAX
What does this mean?

The librarian reads the Henry James quote.

LIBRARIAN
It means try to be worldly.

MAX
You mean like smart.

LIBRARIAN
More or less. Yeah.

MAX
I'd like to see a list of all the

People who've checked-out this book
in the past year.

The librarian goes through the cards in a little wooden box.
INSERT SCRAP OF PAPER:

Miss Cross, lst grade, room 121
INT. HALLWAY. DAY

Max walks down a hallway in the lower school. He is carrying
the little scrap of paper, checking room numbers as he walks.
10

He looks in some of the rooms. He sees kids sitting at tables
with scissors and Paste. Kids watching a movie on science.
Kids curled-up on ts during naptime.

And then he sees room 121. He goes up to the door and looks
through the window.

A class of first graders are sitting Indian-style in a little
circle on the floor. The teacher is in a tiny little kids’
chair, reading aloud from Kidnapped. She is twenty-eight. She
wears a cardigan sweater and her hair pulled back like a
ballet dancer. She is MISS CROSS.

Max's eyes are glued to the glass. He cracks open the door an
inch to listen to her voice.

MISS CROSS
I have seen wicked men and fools, a
great many of both; and I believe
they both get paid in the end.
(darkly: )
But the fools first.

She locks up mysteriously. She turns the page and continues:

MISS CROSS
Chapter fifteen. The Lad with the
Silver Button.

INT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE. DAY

Mr. Blume has a gigantic office with paintings of bk-ctle
scenes and Viking ships, a coat of armor, and a <catue of a
discus thrower. The concrete plant is outside the window.

A portrait of the Blume family hangs on the wall bonind mr.
Blume's desk. His wife and twin sons are ail fai-s-skinned
redheads. Mr. Blume is dark and sullen. He is smoking a
cigarette in the painting.

Mr. Blume sits at his desk with a silver military issue .45
automatic disassembled in front of him. He is cleaning it and
drinking a Bloody Mary. His SECRETARY buzzes him on the
speakerphone. Mr. Blume pushes a button on it.

MR. BLUME
Yeah?

SECRETARY
Mrs. Blume wants you to pick up the
twins from school at --

MR. BLUME
Tell them to take the fucking bus.
il

SECRETARY
OK.

INT. CAR. DAY

Max is sitting in a parked Jaguar with Dirk's mother, MRS.
CALLOWAY. She is beautiful. She is dressed in tennis clothes
and wears a terrycloth visor. .

Max is wearing a fluorescent orange crossing guard's belt
with a badge at the shoulder that says Patrol Chief. He hands
Mrs. Calloway his phone number.

MRS. CALLOWAY
Thank you, Max. I told Mr. Calloway
the other day how fortunate we are
to have someone like you looking
out for Dirk.

MAX
My pleasure. I'm just trying to
impart some of the experiences I've
accrued to help Dirk. There he is now.
Nice talking with you, Mrs. Calloway.

They shake hands. Max gets out of the car and puts his hand
on Dirk's shoulder.

MAX
How'd the math test go?

DIRK
What math test?
MAX
I thought you had a math test.
DIRK
No. Did you turn in your paper on
the Berlin Airlift?

MAX
Yeah. I got an extension.

Dirk gets in the car and drives off. A seventh grader named
BOBBY goes over to Max.

BOBBY
How'd it go?

MAX
I shook hands with her.
BOBBY
Big deal.

MAX .
And I gave her my phone number.

BOBBY
Buchan said he'd have already banged
her by now.

MAX
He said that?

Max looks across the yard at MAGNUS BUCHAN, the burly foreign
exchange student from Scotland. He is seventeen. He has a
straw in his mouth and he shoots a little blowdart at a
littie kid's neck.

Half of Buchan's ear was blown-off in a hunting accident.

MAX
That's a really crude thing to say.
That's Dirk's mother.

BOBBY
But I thought that's why you picked
Dirk as your chapel partner.

MAX
(looks at Bobby, pause)
What are you, a lawyer? All I'm
saying is that gorilla is a guest at
our school for the year, so respect
our women the same way we would in
his jerkwater country.

Mr. Blume pulls up in a brand new black Bentley.

MAX
Mr. Blume!

Max goes over to Mr. Blume's car.

MAX
It's Max Fischer.
MR. BLUME
(weary)
Hi, Max.

They shake hands through the open car window.

MAX
How's the concrete business?
23

MR. BLUME
Oh, I don't know. By the time you
hit 45 you've been fucked over so
many times you don't really care
anymore.

MAX
I'm sorry to hear that.

Mr. Blume sighs deeply. He stares out the windshield.

MR. BLUME
What's the secret, Max?

MAX
The secret?

MR. BLUME
Yeah. You look like you've got it
all figured out.

MAX
{pause)
I don't know. I think you just got
to find something you love to do,
then do it for the rest of your life.
(shrugs)
For me, it's going to Rushmore.

Max looks very serious. Mr. Blume smiles and nods.

MAX
Hey, Ronny. Hey, Donny.

Mr. Blume's red-headed twins RONNY and DONNY come over to the
car. They're Max's age but much more thick and solid.

RONNY
Shotgun.

Denny gets in the front seat anyway. Ronny hollers:

RONNY
I said shotgun, Donny!

MR. BLUME
Get in the back, Ronny.

Denny punches three different buttons on the dash that crank
up the AC full blast. Mr. Blume's hair dances in the cold
burst of air. He shuts off the AC.

MAX
See you tomorrow, Mr. Blume.
{looks off)
Mrs. Reynolds!

Max goes to shake hands with somebody else's parents. Mr.
Blume looks after Max fondly.

MR. BLUME
Did you invite that kid to the
party?

DONNY
(shocked)
Max Fischer?

RONNY
Come on, Dad. There's going to be
girls there.

DONNY
Pull your head out of your ass.

Mr. Blume turns on Donny quickly like he is going to attack
him. Donny cowers grinning in the backseat with his fists up.
Ronny pipes in:

RONNY

Remember what Mom said. Hugs not
hits.

INT. AUDITORIUM. DAY

The school auditorium. The stage is bare except for two
folding chairs. A tall senior plays FRANK. He is wearing a
stocking cap and sunglasses. A fat kid plays WILLIE.

FRANK
Wait a second. What time did the
old lady place the 911 call?

WILLIE
Ten-fifteen.

FRANK
{snaps his fingers)
That's it.
Frank jumps out of his seat.

FRANK
Meet me on the corner in ten minutes.

WILLIE
Where're you going?
FRANK
I Pa tell you in the squad car.

He heads toward the wings, then stops.

FRANK
Oh, and, Willie. You were wrong
about Enrique Sanchez. He died in
his sleep.

He -exits.

MAX
Excellent!

Willie looks into the darkness beyond the stage. Max emerges
and quickly climbs the steps onto the stage. He is followed
by Dirk who is holding a script.

MAX
Excellent. Irving?

The stage manager is a wavy-haired sophomore named IRVING. He
comes out from backstage. Max pulls some money out of his
pocket and hands it to him.

MAX
Get some root beers for anybody
who wants one. I don't want one.
OK. Next scene.
{looks at Dirk's script)
Frank. You enter stage right with
the bag of cocaine.

INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

A small, clean barbershop. MR. FISCHER is a wr.te-haired man
of sixty-five in a white barber's shirt. He nas just finished
giving a buzzcut to a twelve year-old boy named GORDON.

GORDON
May I see the back, please?

Mr. Fischer holds up a hand mirror so Gordon can see the
back. Gordon nods. Max comes in rolling a Japanese ten-speed
at his side.

MR. FISCHER
Hey, Max. How was your day?

MAX
Hm. I'd say
(thinks for a second)
98% good, 2% not so good. I need a
signature on this geometry test, by
the way.

Max leaves his test on the counter and rolls his bike into
the backroom. Gordon gives Mr. Fischer ten dollars.

GORDON
Thank you very much.

Gorden goes out the door. Mr. Fischer looks at the geometry
test. Max comes out of the backroom drinking a glass of
chocolate milk with a straw.

MR. FISCHER

Hm.

MAX
I know.

MR. FISCHER
A 37.

MAX

Pathetic. Just pathetic.

MR. FISCHER
Well. It could've been worse. You

were right more than a third of the
time.

MAX
(exploding)
Come on, Dad! That stinks! I can
do better than that!

MR. FISCHER
Of course, you can.

MAX
For once will you please try not
te look on the bright side?

MR. FISCHER
Sit down and let me give you a
trim.

Max sighs deeply. He sits down. Mr. Fischer signs the

geometry test. He puts a pale blue smock over Max and gives
him a haircut.

MAX
Do you think I'm stupid?
MR. FISCHER
No! You're just Not very good at

math.
MAX
But I'm failing English and History,
too.
MR. FISCHER
(pause)

Well. Maybe you'd be better off at
a school where there's not so much
emphasis on academics.

MAX
What, like barber college?
Mr. Fischer is stricken. Max says quietly:

MAX
No. I love Rushmore. I don't want to
go someplace second rate. Besides,
it would ruin my chances of getting
into Oxford.

Silence. Mr. Fischer looks very sad.

MR. FISCHER :
I wish I knew how to heip you. But
I just don't. I'm sorry, Max.

Max looks at his dad. Mr. Fischer looks down at the floor.

MR. FISCHER
You want to see the back?

MAX
No, thanks. You know how I like it.

INT. THE FISCHER'S HOUSE. NIGHT

An Archie Bunker-type house. Max and Mr. Fischer sit on the
sofa in front of the TV having Tv dinners.

MAX
You think I'm spending too much
of my time starting up clubs and
putting on plays?

MR. FISCHER
I don't know. It's possible.

MAX
I should probably be trying harder
to score chicks. That's the only
thing anybody really cares about.
(sighs deeply)

But it's not my forté, unfortunately.

MR. FISCHER
It'll happen, Max. It's just. You're
like one of those clipper ship
captains. You're married to the sea.

MAX
Yes. That's true.
(paus<)
But I've been out at sea for a
long time.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD. DAY

Miss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class
play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It is 20,000 Leagues
under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and searches
in her pocket for a lighter.

A lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it. He is
wearing a maroon beret. Miss Cross looks at him curiously.

MAX
Hello.

MISS CROSS
Hi.
Miss Cross lights her cigarette on Max's match.

MISS CROSS
I like your hat.

MAX

Thank you. You're a teacher here,
aren't you?

MISS CROSS
Uh-huh.

MAX
What subject do you teach?

MISS CROSS
Well, I teach first grade, so I do
all the subjects. Except music.

MAX
And this is your first year at
Rushmore, I take it.
23

Miss Cross nods.

MAX
I see. How long have you been a
smoker, if you don't mind me asking?

MISS CROSS
(surprised)
Hm. Let's see. How old are you?

MAX
Fifteen.

MISS CROSS
Since I was your age.

MAX
(shocked)
You're kidding.

Miss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this.

MAX
You should quit.

MISS CROSS
You're right.

MAX
(going back to his book)
And I should mind my own business.

Miss Cross laughs. Max looks back up.

MAX
Where’d you go to school, by the
way?

MISS CROSS
Harvard.

MAX
Really? That’s a coincidence. My
top schools where I want to apply
are Oxford and the Sorbonne. But
my safety is Harvard.

MISS CROSS
(smiles)

That’s very ambitious.

MAX
Thank you.
a MISS CROSS
What are you going to major in?

MAX
Well. I haven‘t decided for sure.
But probably a double-major in
Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was
your major?

MISS CROSS
Latin-American studies.

MAX
Ah. That‘s interesting. Did you
hear they're not going to teach
Latin here anymore?

MISS CROSS
This is more like Central America.

MAX
(pause)
Sure. Central America and what-not.
But moving on: they're going to
cancel Latin. They have to make
room for Japanese.

MISS CROSS
Really? That's too bad. All the
Romance Languages come from Latin.
MAX
They do, don't they?
(pause)
Like French, probably.

She nods. She smiles.

MISS CROSS
Nihilo sanctum estne?

MAX
That's Latin, isn't it?

MISS CROSS
Yeah.

MAX
What does it mean?

MISS CROSS
Is nothing sacred?
Long pause. Looking right at her.

. MAX
Sic transit gloria. Glory fades.
I'm Max Fischer.

Max slides down the bench and puts out his hand.
MISS CROSS
Hi.
They shake hands.
INT. LUNCHROOM. DAY

A crowd of MIDDLE SCHOOLERS has gathered around Max. He is
holding a clipboard. One of the kids finishes signing a piece
of paper on it.

MAX
Good. Now you.
(points to the next kid)
Sign here.

The kid signs.
INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:

A long list of signatures. Many of them are written in little
kids' handwriting. Some are neater. Across the top it says
PETITION. This is written in calligraphy.

cuT TO:

The administration conference room. TEN TEACHERS sit in
chairs around a long table. Max stands before them finishing
a speech. The petition is tacked-up on the wall behind him.

MAX
In summation I have only one ques-
tion: is Latin dead? Nisilum sacnus
(pause, looks at his notecards)
estne? Only you can say. Thank you
for your time.

Applause.

INSERT ANNOUNCEMENT:

Thanks in part to the efforts of 10th
class member Max Fischer, Latin will now
be a required course for grades 7 through

INT. HALLWAY. DAY
22

Max and a bunch of other kids are reading this announcement
on the bulletin board. Max is smiling S@renely. The others
are cursing and locking at Max with angry faces. Magnus
Buchan is one of them. He has a strong Scottish accent.

MAGNUS
Bugger off, Fischer. Ya bleedin’
little bollocks.

MAX
Is that Latin? Not bad, Buchan.
Maybe you'll place out of your
firsce year.

INT. GYM. DAY

Mr. Blume's son Ronny is in a wrestling match. He's get his
opponent in a choke hold and is slowly strangling him.

Mr. Blume looks on distastefully from the stands. Max is at
his side.

MR. BLUME
Tell me something, Max. What do
you make of this game?

MAX
(philosophically) ’
Well. I don't mean to be critical.
But, in my opinion, it's not a
very elegant sport.

MR. BLUME
I think you're right.

MAX
Thank you.

Mr. Blume shakes his head and stares across the gym. Ronny is
crushing his opponent's face into the mat with his fist.

MR. BLUME
Never in my wildest imaginations
did I dream I would have sons like
these.

(sighs)
What does your dad do, Max?

(frankly)
He's a neurosurgeon.

MR. BLUME
is he?

MAX
Yeah. Over at St. Joseph's. Personally.
I could never see myself cutting open
somebody's brain. But he enjoys it.
(pause)
You were in Vietnam, weren't you?

MR. BLUME
Uh-huh.
MAX
Were you in the shit?
MR. BLUME
Yeah. I was in the shit.
MAX
(wistfully)

We lost that one, didn't we?
Mr. Blume nods.

WRESTLER
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume.

A stocky WRESTLER with an icepack on his arm walks by on his
way to the showers. Mr. Blume nods to him without looking up.

MAX
What's Sunday? Oh. That's right.
The twins’ birthday party.

Ronny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with his
body. Donny screams encouragement. Mr. Blume looks to Max.

MR. BLUME
You want to come?

MAX
(regretfully)
I'd love to. Except I already have
a previous obligation. But thanks
for the invitation.

Max smiles very sincerely. Mr. Blume looks at him for a
minute.

MR. BLUME
Come work for me.

MAX
What?
24

MR. BLUME
Come work for me.

MAX
(stiffens)
I may not be rich, Mr. Blume. And
my father may only be a doctor. But
we manage.

MR. BLUME
Well, I didn't mean it like that.
I just thought it might be nice to
have you in the company.

MAX
I appreciate the offer. But I've
got everything I need right here at
Rushmore. As long as they don't kick
me out. Besides, it wouldn’t be fair.

REFEREE
110's!

MAX
Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking
with you.

Max pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights
underneath. Mr. Blume looks suprised.

MR. BLUME
You're on the team?

MAX
(shrugs)
I'm an alternate.

Max heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr. Blume
calls after him:

MR. BLUME
What wouldn’t be fair, Max?

MAX
(looking back over his shoulder)
We'd make too much money working
on the same team.

Mr. Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his match.
Max is clearly outclassed and gets quickly pinned.

INT. HALLWAY. DAY
2s

Miss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom. They
are singing a song as they walk down the corridor. Across the
hall a fourth gr. teacher, MRS. GUGGENHEIM, comes out of

her classroom. She is a handsome woman in her late sixties
with black and silver hair.

MISS CROSS
Hello, Mrs. Guggenheim.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Hi, Rosemary. How’s everything
shaping up?

MISS CROSS
Fine, thanks.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
You find a place?

MISS CROSS
Well, I'm just staying over at
Edward's parents' house for now.
They're out of town.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Oh. That‘s good.
(pause)
Edward was one of my students,
you know. I was awfully sorry to
hear about thar.

Miss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points to a
photograph in a collage on the wall.

MISS CROSS
I think I met that boy yesterd.

Mrs. Guggenheim looks at the picture.

INSERT PHOTOGRAPH:

It is a black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a

showtune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top hat in
one hand and a cane in the other.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
That's Max Fischer. He’s one of
my favorites.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB. DAY

Ronny and Donny set upon a pile of birthday presents at a
table by the pool. They are surrounded by kids in swimsuits.
26

Mr. Blume sits alone at the next table drinking a whiskey in
front of the demolished birthday cake. He has a tattoo on his
shoulder that says Semper Fi. There is a bucket of golf balls
in front of him and he absentiy tosses them into the pool one
at a time.

He looks over at MRS. BLUME. She has red hair just like the
twins. She is flirting with a pretty-boy TENNIS PRO. She
lecks back to Mr. Blume coldly.

Mr. Blume gets up and walks around the pool. He pauses to
shake hands with a BIG MAN drinking a glass of scotch. The
big man gives Mr. Blume a sudden shove toward the pool, but
hangs onto him so he doesn't fall in. The big man laughs.

Mr. Blume climbs up the ladder to the high dive. He sets down
his cocktail. He slips and falls and bangs his knee hard on
the edge of the board. He gets up quickly. There is a had cut
on his knee and he is bleeding. He looks out at the birthday
party down below.

People begin to notice him up there.

He sprints down the board, bounces once as high as he can,
and sails out long through the air. He tucks into a
canonball. He nails the water with a huge splash.

Mrs. Blume gets up with a bitter look on her face and heads
for the ladies room.

Kids gather at the edge of the pool to look down at Mr. Blume
playing dead at the bottom with golf balls all around him. A
little boy in a Speedo swims underwater to examine Mr. Blume.
Their eyes meet. The boy turns and swims away.

INT. CLASSROOM. DAY

Miss Cross's classroom. The walls are lined with fishtanks
that glow blue and make bubbling sounds. There are maps and
pictures everywhere. A model of a 747 hangs from the ceiling.
A record player plays the Vienna Boys’ Choir at a low volume.

There is only one KID in the room. He is taking a test. Miss
Cross sits at her desk grading papers.

Max cracks open the door.

MAX
Miss Cross?

Miss Cross and the kid look back at Max. Miss Cross holds her
finger to her lips and gets up. As she walks past the kid she
puts her hand on the top of his head. She goes to Max at the
door. She whispers:
27

MISS CROSS
He's taking a make-up test.

MAX
These guys have tests?

MISS CROSS
Of course.

MAX
I thought they just did coloring
and stuff.

MISS CROSS
Oh, no. They're good readers.

MAX
I'm Max Fischer. We met the other
day.

MISS CROSS
I know who you are. How are you?

MAX
Fine, thank you.

Max just stands there.

MISS CROSS .
You want to help me feed the fish?

MAX
Yes, please.

Max follows her from tank to tank as she shakes out fish
food. They continue to whisper to each other:

MAX
I thought I would just let you know,
as per our conversation the other day --

MISS CROSS
Latin?

MAX
Right. The Romance Languages. I gave
a little speech --

MISS CROSS
I heard about this.

MAX
You did?
MISS CROSS
Uh-huh. I understand you made a
very convincing argument.

MAX
I thought you'd be pleased to hear
they're going to continue the Latin
program.

She looks at Max. She sets down the fish food and shakes his
hand.

MISS CROSS
I'm very impressed.
MAX
Thank you very much.

Max picks up the can of fish food and shakes some into one of
the aquariums.

MAX
You need an assistant?
MISS CROSS
(smiles)
Do we get to have assistants around
here?
MAX

I doubt it. I'm on scholarship,
though. Academic scholarship. So
sometimes I get to do odd jobs.
(pause)

How did you decide to teach at
Rushmore?

MISS CROSS
My husband went here.

Max drops the can of fish food into the tank. He quickly
fishes it out. He picks some little bits of fish food out of
the water and throws them away. Pause.

MAX

I didn’t know you were married.
MISS CROSS

Well, he’s dead now. So I’m not,

actually.

MAX
When did he die?
MISS CROSS
Last year.

Max nods. Silence.

MAX
My mother’s dead.

MISS CROSS
Oh. I’m sorry to hear that.

MAX
She died when I was seven.
(raising an eyebrow)
So we both have dead people in
our families.
They look at each other for a minute.

MAX
Now what's going on in here?

Max kneels down and looks into one of the fishtanks. There
are a hundred little seahorses swimming around in it.

MISS CROSS
Those were just born.

A look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the
blue water.

MAX
You really love fish, don’t you?

Miss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass.

MAX
How much do these cost?

INT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE. DAY

Mr. Blume's office. He is talking on the telephone. Max sits
in a chair across from him.

MR. BLUME
I don't want any alloys. I want steel.
(pause)
I don't give a rat's ass if he did.
(pause)

Steel, Harry.
He hangs up.
30

MR. BLUME
Yoy change your mind? You want the job?
ve

No. But I've got an idea. And I need
some money.

Mr. Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone.

SECRETARY
Mr. Blume, they're ready for you in
Hydraulics.

MR. BLUME

Come with me. Let's hear your idea.
INT. FACTORY. DAY

Max, Mr. Blume, and a big foreman named ERNIE race across the
factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're squeezed together
with Max in the middle.

MAX
Rushmore deserves an aquarium. A
first class aquarium where scientists
can lecture, and students can study
marine life in their natural --

MR. BLUME
I don't know. What do you think,
Ernie?

ERNIE
(skeptical)
An aquarium?

MAX
A huge aquarium. An entire building.

ERNIE
What kind of fish?

INT. FACTORY. DAY

Mr. Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a scaffolding
overlooking a huge vat of bubbling concrete.

MAX
(shouting)
Electric eels. Baracudas. Stingrays.
Hammerheads. Piranhas.

MR. BLUME
Piranhas?
MAX
That's right. Piranhas. I talked to
aman in South America.

MR. BLUME
Really. So you might have piranhas.

MAX
We will have piranhas.

INT. MR. BLUME'S OFFICE OFFICE. DAY

Back in Mr. Blume’s office. They're seated as before. Max is
still wearing his hardhat.

Leng pause.

MR. BLUME
What does Guggenheim say?
MAX
Nothing. I felt I should go to you
first.
MR. BLUME
Why?
MAX

Because at this moment I feel our
best strategy is to keep a low pro-
file. The more preparation I can
do, the stronger our case will be
when we go to the administration.

MR. BLUME
How much do you want?

MAX
$5000 for the initial plans.

Max holds Mr. Blume‘'s gaze. Mr. Blume picks up a pen.

MR. BLUME
I'll give you $2500.

Max nods. Mr. Blume writes out a check, tears it off, and
hands it to Max. Max sticks it in his pocket like it is a
five dollar bill.

RESEARCH MONTAGE:

All of the following events occur during school hours.
32

Max strides across the quadrangle with a determined
expression. He's got an armload of books on marine life.

Max watches a Jaques Cousteau film on i6mm in an empty
classroom. Dirk runs the projector.

Max visits a marine research facility and talks with a
SCIENTIST. Max holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A

killer whale jumps out of the water and takes it in its
teeth.

Max flies over Rushmore in a chopper with Mr. Blume. He
shouts out details of the landscape and Mr. Blume nods
enthusiastically. They are both eating sandwiches.

They set down on the soccer field. Kids come running out to
meet them. Max waves to them as he jumps out of the chopper.
He looks back to Mr. Blume and gives him a thumbs-up. Mr.
Blume smiles and waves as the chopper takes off.

Max walks with a young ARCHITECT among the trees between the
gym and the baseball diamond. They look at some blueprints.
Max pulls up third base and slides it over a few feet.

Max points to some beautiful fish in an aqaurium in a pet
shop. The pet shop OWNER reaches in with a little net.

Max pokes his head into Miss Cross' classroom. He holds up

two plastic baggies full of water with tropical fish swimming
around inside them.

Kids gather all around them as they put the new fish into the
aquariums. Max smiles mysteriously.

MAX
You need any help grading papers
or anything?

INSERT BOOK REPORT:

The title is Young Ben Franklin. Miss Cross writes
Magnificent! Keep up the good work! and draws two stars
across the top of the page with a red pen.

INT. MISS CROSS' CLASSROOM. DAY

Max is staring at Miss Cross in a trance from a desk opposite
hers in the empty classroom. She looks up at him. He
continues to stare at her as if she were a statue.

Miss Cross rubs her eyes and sighs. She sets down her red
pen. She looks back to Max. He is still staring at her.
33

MISS CROSS
Max?

Max looks quickly down to his papers.

MAX
Uh-huh?
MISS CROSS
Can I ask you something?
MAX
Sure.
MISS CROSS

Has it ever crossed your mind that
you're way too young for me?

Max looks up. Miss Cross smiles faintly. Silence.

MAX
It‘s crossed my mind that you might
consider that a possibility, yes.

MISS CROSS
Not to mention that you're a student --

MAX
And you're a teacher. And never the
twain shall meet. I know. I'm not
trying to pressure you into any-
thing, Miss Cross. I'm surprised
you brought it up so blunrly.

MISS CROSS
I just want to make sure --

MAX
We've become friends, haven't we?

MISS CROSS
Yes.

MAX
Good. That's all that matters to me.

Max thinks for a second, then presses on:

MAX
And the truth is neither one of us
has the slightest idea where this
relationship is going. We can‘t pre-
dict the future.
34

MISS CROSS
We don't have a relationship, Max.
MAX
But we're friends.
MISS CROSS
Yes. And that's all we're going to
be.
MAX

That's what I meant by relationship.
You want me to grab a dictionary?

MISS CROSS
I just want to make sure we under-
stand each other.

MAX
I understand. You're not attracted
to me. C'est la vie. I'ma big hoy.

MISS CROSS
Max. You're fifteen. Attraction
doesn't enter into it.

MAX
If you say so. All I'm getting at is
I've never met anyone like you. Take
that for whatever it's worth.

She thinks about this for a minute.

MISS CROSS
I think I can safely say I've never
met anyone like you
(pause)
in a long time, either.

MAX
You haven't, have you?

Miss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly:

MAX
You want to shake hands?

She puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk.
But they don't let.go. They just look at each other.

MAX
I'm glad we had this conversation.

MISS CROSS
35

Me, too.

a
They finally let igo of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks
away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided.

MAX
Bye the bye. Are you free Thursday
night?

MISS CROSS

Free for what?

MAX
Dinner.

She looks at Max strangely.

MAX
We're getting a group together
after the play.

INSERT PLAYBILL:

"SERPICO"
a new play by Max Fischer

INT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT
A very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment.

Four men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'REILLY,
BURNUM, and FIELDS. One has long hair, a beard, leather
pants, and a big silver crucifix around his neck. This is
Frank Serpico. They are all played by high schoolers.

FRANK
I can‘t wear a wire! They're feeling
me up every day!

O'REILLY
Come on, Frank. You'll have complete
protection.

FRANK
(walking off)
I‘ve heard that one before. I got
to go put a dime in the meter.

BURNUM
Look, Officer Serpico. If you agree
to testify in open co --
Frank wheeis around and knocks the clipboard out of

O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields
instinctively draws his firearm.

FRANK
Promise me one thing, O'Reilly.
You're going to follow this ail
the way. To the end
(snaps)
of the line,
(snaps)
where I got to be.

O'REILLY
(looking Frank right in the eye)
So help me, God.

The audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are
sitting on the floor at the very front.

Max watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience.
He sees Mr. Blume smiling proudly in the third row.

He sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired
MEDICAL STUDENT in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him
and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and
whispers something back.

Max stares at them blankly as a shootout erupts onstage.

INT. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT

Frank comes off stage with a bandage on his cheek and a cane
in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a
headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up.

MAX
What happened to the cannoli line?

Max follows Frank as Frank walks quickly toward the dressing
rooms .

MAX
You're supposed to say, Forget
about it, Sanchez --

FRANK
(very angry)
I made a mistake, all right? It
didn't make any difference, anyway .

MAX
Hey, I'm letting it go. But don't
tell me it doesn’t matter, Every
line matters.

FRANK
(yelling)
Get off my back!

MAX
Don't fuek with my play!

Frank turns around and punches Max in the nose. Max takes a
swing and misses and they wrestle around as people try to
break it up.

INT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT

The whole cast is onstage bowing as the audience applauds.
Some of the actors motion to the wings.

Max walks out onto the stage. He's got a bloody kleenex in
each nostril. He waves to the audience. The applause roars.

INT. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT

The crowded dressing rooms. Actors are taking off their make-

up. Max is drinking a champagne cocktail and talking with his
father and an elderly WOMAN.

WOMAN
I thought the acting tonight ‘was
excellent.

MAX
It was better in rehearsals.
(to his father)
I'll catch up with you later, Dad.
I’ve got a dinner to go to.

MR. FISCHER
(interested)
Oh, yeah?

MAX
Yeah.
(pause)
Cast and crew only.

Mr. Fischer feels left out but tries not to show it.

MR. FISCHER
OK. Well, have a good time.
38

Miss Cross walks over to Max through the crowd. Her friend
the medical student follows behind her. Max’s expression is
~~ polite but inscrutable.

MISS CROSS
That was great, Max.

MAX
I'm so glad you could come.

MISS CROSS

I want you to meet a friend of mine.
John Coats. Max Fischer.

MAX
(not looking at him)
Who's this guy?

MISS CROSS
‘ (pause)
: John.

Max looks at John. John smiles. Pause.
JOHN
I really liked your play, man. It
was really cool.

Max nods. He drinks a long sip of his champagne cocktail.

MISS CROSS

What happened to your nose?
MAX

I got punched in the face.

(to John)
What's your excuse?

Mr. Blume comes over to them.

MR. BLUME

Am I going to get to meet your dad
tonight, Max?

MAX
Nah. The old man’s on call tonight.
Mr. Blume, I'd like you to meet Miss
Cross and I didn’t catch this young
gentieman’s name.

INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT

A fancy restaurant. Max is having dinner with Mr. Blume, Miss
Cross, and John. Max is drunk.
MAX .
I like your nurse's uniform, guy.

JOHN
These are OR scrubs.
MAX
(pause)
OR they?

Mr. Blume laughs suddenly and wine goes up his nose. Max
glances to him slyly, then looks back to John.

MAX
Well, they're totally inappropriate
for the occasion.

JOHN
Well, I didn't know we were going to
dinner.

MAX

That's because you weren't invited.

MR. BLUME
Take it easy, Max.

MISS CROSS
(angry)
You're the one who ordered him a
scotch and soda.

MAX
What's wrong with that? I can write a
hit play. Why can’t I have a drink when
I want to unwind a little? So tell me,
Curly. How do you know Miss Cross?

JOHN
We went to Harvard together.

MAX
(shrugs)
And I wrote a hit play. And directed
it. So I'm not sweating it, either.

MR. BLUME
(signalling the waiter)
I'm going to get the check.

MAX
What do you think you're doing?
40

MR. BLUME
" getting the --

MAX
No, you‘re not.

The WAITER comes over. Max intercepts him:

MAX
I just wanted to thank you again for
accomodating us. We only expected to
be a party of three, but somebody
invited himself along. 1 apologize.

WALTER
That's perfectely all right.

The waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns.

MISS CROSS
You're being rude, Max.

MAX
No, I'm not. I'm just trying to
figure out why you brought this
gentleman to my play. And my dinner
which was invitation only.

John reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his
spoon and swats John on the back of the hand.

MAX
Would you like me to pass you the
butter?

Max hands John the butter.

MISS CROSS
What's wrong with you?

MAX
(raising his voice)
What's wrong with you?

Max is making a scene. People all over "ae restaurant are
watching. Max stares at Miss Cross.

MAX
You hurt my feelings. This night
was important to me.

MISS CROSS
How did I hurt your feelings?
41

MAX
I wrote a hit play!
(pause)
And I’m in love with you.

John looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max
looks drunk and dejected.

MAX
How do you like that, Curly?

EXT. PLAYGROUND. DAY

Miss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting
pictures. Each kid has an easel.

Miss Cross sees Mr. Blume standing under a tree at the edge
of the playground. He is wearing sunglasses and smoking a
cigarette. He moves slightly behind the tree. She stares at
him.

He waves. She waves back. He comes over.

MR. BLUME
Hi.

MISS CROSS
Were you hiding over there?
Mr. Blume shrugs. He points at one of the paintings.

MR. BLUME
What's that?

The ARTIST looks up at Mr. Blume. He is a small boy with jet-
black curly hair and piercing eyes.

ARTIST
(makes a swimming gesture)
It's a little swimming snake.

Mr. Blume nods.

MISS CROSS
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume?

Mr. Blume turns to Miss Cross and takes off his sunglasses.
Silence.

MR. BLUME
Max wants to see you.

MISS CROSS
She frowns and

42

What for?

MR. BLUME
To apologize, I guess.

MISS CROSS
He sent you here?

MR. BLUME
Yeah.

Studies Mr. Blume for a minute.

MISS CROSS
Are you his messenger?

MR. BLUME
No. He’s my friend.

(pause)
You were right. I shouldn't have let
him drink.

Miss Cross neds. Silence.

Mr. Blume nods.

MISS CROSS
IT don't think I should see Max any-
more.

MR. BLUME

He's not going to like the sound of
that.

MISS CROSS
I know. But I think I let him get
too attached.

Miss Cross looks uncertain.

MISS CROSS
Don't you think?

MR. BLUME
(shrugs)
I don't know. You did your best.

Miss Cross smiles sadly to Mr. Blume. He Puts his hands in

his pockets.

MISS CROSS
Tell him I'm sorry.

MR. BLUME
OK.
They look at each other for a long minute. Miss cross tucks a
strand of hair behind her ear. Mr. Blume Says quietly:

MR. BLUME
What's your first name?
MISS CROSS
Rosemary. What's yours?
MR. BLUME
Herman.
Silence.
MR. BLUME

Oh, yeah. He wrote you a letter.
He hands her a letter in a sealed envelope. She takes it.

MISS CROSS
Thanks.

They stand there in silence for another minute.

MR. BLUME
OK. So long, Rosemary.

MISS CROSS
(smiles)
Bye, Herman.

Mr. Blume starts to go. He stops. He looks hack <o Miss
Cross.

MR. BLUME
Should we meet somewhere?

She hesitates.

MR. BLUME
To talk about Max.

MISS CROSS
Yeah. I don’t know.
(pause)
Maybe.

Mr. Blume nods. He turns away and walks off. She watches him
go. She looks at the envelope.

I’m going anyway.

Max goes over to the contracter:

MAX
Chop it down, Mr. Chandler! we've
got an aquarium to build.

Max talks to another reporter.

MAX
I don’t give a shit about barracudas.
But fuck it. I'm building it anyway.

appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a SECURITY
GUARD with a waikie-talkie. Dr. Guggenheim screams:

are wrinkled and his head has been shaved like a Marine's.
His eyes have dark circles around them. He's got a little
stack of index cards in his hand.

We have a new student with us today.
His name's Max Fischer and he's

Sure. Thanks very much. I just wanted
to introduce myself.

Max looks quickly at his notecards.

MAX
I'm Max Fischer. I'm a former student
of Rushmore Academy, which I recently
got expelled from.

Max flips to the next notecard.

MAX
This is my first time in a public
school. And I know you probably think
I was born with a silver spoon in my
mouth. But I’m no elitist. I think
you've got some great facilities, and
I'm really looking forward to making
the best of it over here at Grover
Cleveland for a short period of time.

Max sighs deeply. He rubs his eyes. His CLASSMATES have no
idea what to make of him. However, one Asian girl in the back
row is smiling faintly. She has short-cropped hair. The spine
of one of her bookcovers Says MARGARET YANG.

MAX
One footnote: I neticed you don't
have a fencing team. I'm going to
start one up. Let me know if you'd
like to join. Thanks.

INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY

The wide halls of Grover Cleveland High are lined with orange
lockers. A banner stretched down the wall says Murder the

Mustangs. A bustling throng of high schoolers rushes to
class.

Max walks slowly alone down the middle of the hall. A blonde
cheerleader-type GIRL asks him:

GIRL
Why are you so dressed up?
49

Max looks down at his clothes. He looks back to the girl.

MAX
Are you insane?

The girl walks off. Margaret Yang catches-up to Max.

MARGARET
Max?
MAX
(frowns)
Yes?
MARGARET

Hi. I'm Margaret Yang. I’m in Mrs.
Whitney’s class. I just wanted to
tell you I liked your speech. I don’t
think I’ve ever heard of anyone ask-
ing to give a speech in class before.

MAX
How unfortunate.

MARGARET
The silver spoon remark might rub
some people the wrong way. But I
think I know how you mean it.

MAX
Glad to hear it. Goodbye, Miss Chang.

Max ducks into the men’s room. Margaret walks quietly away.
INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY

A tiny figure dressed all in white stands alone at the far
end of the huge gymnasium with a fencing foil. He lunges,
parries, thrusts.

The basketball team suddenly floods dribbling into the
gymnasium throwing passes and taking free throws. Max stops
fencing as they take over the gymnasium. He watches them in
silence. He shakes his head. He walks off the court.

INT. HALLWAY. DAY

Max puts a quarter in the pay phone. He is still wearing his
fencing costume.

MAX
Janet. Max Fischer. Is he in?

EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY
50

Mr. Blume answers on his cellular phone as he gets out of his

car and walks across the lawn at Rushmore. We intercut the
two of them.

MR. BLUME
Hey, Max. How's it going over there?

MAX
Terrible. Tell me something. When
you talked to Miss Cross the other
day, did you get the feeling --

The hall monitor MR. HOLSTEAD comes down the hall toward Max.
He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a
striped tie and his sleeves rolled-up.

MR. HOLSTEAD
{loudly}
Do you have a telephone pass?

Max holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He
covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume.

Mr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms.
Kids look out at him curiously.

MR. BLUME
I got to tell you, Max. I don't knew
what you see in her. I don't think
she's right for you.

MAX
What's that supposed to mean?

Mr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He
stares at her in a trance. He whispers:

MR. BLUME
Well, she's not that beautiful. She's
not that interesting. I mean, sure,
there‘s something about her. But I
see you with someone --

MAX
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are
valuable, but let‘s get to the point.
Will she see me again? Yes or no?

MR. BLUME
(pause)
No.
$l

MAX
I’m going to go see her. Hang on.

Max looks to Mr. Holstead.

MAX
I'm talking on the telephone.

Mr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone.

MAX
Come on. That's rude.

INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL
Mrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window as:

Max opens a red metal door onto the empty concrete courtyard.
He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to
the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away.

EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY

Max rides full speed through the gates onto the Rushmore
campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward
the bike racks standing on one pedal.

Max locks-up his bike and walks across the lawn.

MAGNUS
Fischer. You better beat it, laddie.

Max looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a
cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife.

MAX
I hope you fall out of that tree and
get stuck in the ass, Buchan.

MAGNUS
You know, I‘ve watched you, Fischer.
Showboat, always talking, picking a
kid like Dirk cause his mother's a
great piece and then getting nowhere.
Like everything you do. Big show. No
results.

MAX
And what do you call getting a hand
job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar?

MAGNUS
A bloody lie.
wn
vu

MAX
You think I got kicked our for just
Che aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It
was the hand job. And I'll tell you
another thing. It was worth it. So
eat your heart out out, mick. I got
business to attend to.

EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY

Miss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a
basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her station
wagon and digs in her bag for her keys.

MAX
Can I talk to you?

Miss Cross turns around. Max is Standing across the driveway
with a sad smile on his face.

MAX
Or do you want me to go?

MISS CROSS
{looks around, sighs)
You can talk to me.

Miss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and
they stand there in silence.

MAX

I'm sorry I embarassed you at dinner.
MISS CROSS

That's OK.
MAX

No, it's not. And please apologize
to what's his name for me.

MISS CROSS
I will. Are you Ox?

MAX
I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I
miss the seasons. And watching the
leaves change.

MISS CROSS
But it's only three blocks away.

MAX
I know. And I miss seeing you.
MISS CROSS
(Qause)
~~ sfniss you, too.

\

: Max looks off into the trees. A squirrel leaps from one
branch to another. Max smiles and shakes his head. A crashing

1 noise is heard from the roof of the planetarium. Someone

| ducks for cover, but Max and Miss Cross don’t see hin.

Max reaches into his backpack and says mysteriously:

MAX
By the way. What time does the

library close? I got an overdue
book to turn in.

Max takes out the Jacques Cousteau library book and hands it
to Miss Cross. She looks at it and starts to say something,
but she stops. She opens the book and looks at it in silence.

MAX
That‘s your handwriting, isn’t it?

Max shows her the Henry James quote. Miss Cross nods.

MAX
Not bad. Except it’s probably bad
form for a teacher to write in a
f on

library book.

MISS CROSS

It wasn’t a library book when I
wrote in it.

MAX
What do you mean?

MISS CROSS
I gave this book to Rushmore.

Max looks puzzled. Miss Cross shows him a little card inside
the front cover of the book.

INSERT LIBRARY BOOK:

In Memory of EDWARD APPLEBY
Class of ‘87

MISS CROSS
My husband gave me this book in
seventh grade. And he went to Rush-
more. So when he died I put it in
the library here.
54

MAX
So that's who that is. Edward Appleby.
(looks to Miss Cross)

You already knew him in seventh
grade?

MISS CROSS
I_knew him all my life.
(looks to Max)
You remind me of him. you know.

I do? How?

MISS CROSS
Well. Weren't you in the Rushmore
Beekeepers?

MAX
(frowns)

Yeah. I was president of them.

MISS CROSS
(shrugs)
He founded that club.

MAX
(pause)
I get your meaning. I founded a
few clubs myself in my day.

An acorn falls on Max’s head. He looks up. There is no one
there, but a scurrying sound is heard. Max frowns.

MAX
What was that? A squirrel?

Mr. Blume is crouched just out of view on the reof. He looks
back over his shoulder and sees a small, white-haired, Indian
GROUNDSKEEPER looking at him. The groundskeeper is holding a
rake. Mr. Blume rises slowly. He whispers;

MR. BLUME
Is this the natatorium?

The groundskeeper frowns and shakes his head.

MAX
Do you think we can be friends
again, Miss Cross? In a strictly
Platonic way.

MISS CROSS
Of course, I do. Do you think you
Can make a go of it and settle down
over at Grover Cleveland?

MAX
Yeah. But I need a tutor,

MISS CROSS
I’ll'be your tutor.

MAX
(looking into her eyes)
You will?

Miss Cross smiles and nods.

MAX
Thank you.
(pause)
What are you doing tomorrow?

CUT TO:

Mr. Blume sitting at the desk in his office. Max yells at him
over the speakerphone:

MAX
She's taking me on a field trip!

MR. BLUME
(hesitates) :
Great! You need anybody to help
you chaperone?

MAX

You'd take the time out of your
business to do that?

MR. BLUME
Business schmizness.

MR. BLUME
Does Max know?

DIRK
No. And I don’t want him to know.
Ever. I just want it to stop. Right

They stare at each other.

DIRK
You're a married man, Blume. And
you're supposed to be his friend.

MR. BLUME
Look, Dirk. I am his friend --

DIRK
Yeah. And with friends like you,
who needs friends?

What are you talking about, Buchan?

MAGNUS

He thinks your mum’s good for a bonk.
That's why he picked you for his
chapel partner.

Dirk looks deeply wounded. But he doesn't want to believe it:

DIRK
Who sold you that crock?

MAGNUS
He told me himself. He says she gave
him a hand job in the backseat of her
bloody Jaguar.

DIRK
Max would never say that.

MAGNUS
(smiles)
Yeah. You're probably right. After

INSERT LETTER:

Written neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral
notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm.

Dear Max,

I am sorry to say that I have secretly
found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair
with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I
saw them Frenching at the miseum, and then I knew
for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr.
Blume’s swimming pool, giving each other hand
jobs while you were taking a nap on the front
porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because
you're such a goog friend. Take care, pal.

Fondly,
Dirk Calloway.

Going skinny dipping while I took a
nap. Are you comfortable, Max? I'll
just be out back nude getting hand
jobs with the woman you love.

MR. BLUME
(frowns)

We never went skinny dipping.

MAX
Sure, you didn’t. And next you're
going to tell me you didn’t just
walk out of her house at two
o’clock in the morning.

MR. BLUME
(pause)
I'm in love with her.

MAX
Well, I was in love with her first.
And all that crap about, I don't
think she’s that great, I don't
think she's right for you, Max.
That was all bullshit, wasn’t it?

Silence.

MAX
Do you think she's in love with you?

MR. BLUME
I don't know.

MAX

Well, I guarantee you she's not.
And she never will be.

MR. BLUME

MAX
You want me to cut to the chase?

Silence. Max puts down his sandwich and gathe-~s his thoughts.

MAX
OK. As you know, Mr. Blume and = used
to be friends.

MRS. BLUME
I have no idea what the relationship
is between you and Herman. Honestly,
I find it very bizarre.

I'm not impiving anything. You make
a very strange couple. It's too bad
Herman doesn't have that kind of
Silence.

affection for his own children.

MAX
Well, I'm sure he does,

MRS. BLUME
No, he doesn't.

MAX
IT know you don't really mean that.

MRS. BLUME

Of course, I do.

MAX
From his perspective it's --

MRS. BLUME
Why did you call me?

MAX
That's what I'm trying to tell you,

MRS. BLUME
(icily)
Please. Get to the point.

MAX
Gladly. Your husband's fucking a
school teacher, pardon my French.
I thought you should know.

MRS. BLUME
Why are you telling me this? Are you
trying to hurt Mr. Blume? Or are you
trying to hurt me?

you.

Then you’re trying to hurt Herman.

Max walks into the quadrangle with a cold expression on his
face. It is Halloween and there is a jack-o-lantern cn the
steps. Lots of kids are dressed in costumes.

Suddenly, Max is being pelted with rocks. He looks around

frantically and sees Dirk and a long-haired kid named Tomy
STALLINGS as they set upon

Dirk is dressed as a sorcerer. Tommy has on a karate outfir
with a black belt. Max runs for cover behind some bushes.

MAX
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
DIRK
You're trespassing! This is private
property!
More rocks sail past Max. A pinecone hits him in the head.

MAX
Wait a minute! Stop!

Max raises his hands in the air. Dirk motizns for Tommy to
hold his fire. Max slowly stands up.

MAX
Let's have a truce for a second. I
want to talk.
They meet out in the open. Tommy follows with a rock in each
hand. Silence.
MAX
What's this all about?
Dirk stares at Max.for a long minute.
DIRK

Did you say my mother gave you a
hand job?
7

(shocked)
What?

DIRK
(steely)
Did you say it.

MAX
Who told you that goddamn lie?

Silence.

MAX
Never mind. I know who said it. And
I'm going to stick a knife in his
heart. And I'm going to send him back
to Ireland in a bodybag.

TOMMY
He's from Scotland.

MAX
Well, tell that stupid mick he just
made my list of things to do today.
I'm going to pop a cap in his ass.

INT. TEAROOM. DAY

A little salon with Persian rugs. There is a fire in the
fireplace and a harpsichord plays softly on the radio. pr.
Guggenheim is sitting at a little table having tea with Max.

Dr. Guggenheim has several bottles of prescription medicine
in front of him and a blanket wrapped around him like a

shawl. He stares at Max stonily. There is a manilla envelope
on the table in between them.

MAX
Did you receive the packgage?

Dr. Guggenheim motions to the envelope. Max nods.
MAX
Good. I just wanted to inform you
about what’s going on.
Dr. Guggenheim stares at Max with contempt.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
I never took you for an informer, Max.

MAX
(frowns)
What‘s that supposed to mean?

Silence. Max reaches out to take the envelope. Dr. Guggenheim
slams his hand on it and leans across the table at Max.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
(fiercely)
She resigned this morning. Before 1
even got your little snapshots. so
your latest attempt at sabotage has
backfired.

MAX
(pause)
But she’s one of the best teachers
you've got.
(yelling)
How could you let her resign?

DR. GUGGENHEIM

{yelling back at him)

Why are you trying to get her fired?
MAX

You stupid old fool! I'm trying to
win her back!

Dr. Guggenheim starts coughing and turning red. He knocks the
envelope off the table and the pictures spill out all over
the floor.

INSERT PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE FLOOR:

They're of Mr. Blume and Miss Cross kissing in the window of
a Chinese restaurant.

INT. MISS CROSS’ CLASSROOM. DAY

A crew of MOVERS are rolling one of Miss Cross’ aquariums out
of the room on a dolly as Max comes to the door. Miss Cross
is on the other side of the classroom taking down a map from
the wall. Her books and papers are stacked in boxes.

Max watches her in silence for a minute before saying:

MAX
Miss Cross?

She turns around to look at Max. Silence.

MISS CROSS
Hi, Max

MAX
You need any help?

& MISS CROSS
I have it.

She pricks her finger and holds it to her mouth.

MISS CROSS
Dammit.

Max starts to go in the room to help her.

MAX
Here. Let me see.

MISS CROSS
No. Please, don’t come in here.
Look. I’m sorry I hurt you. I’m
sorry I love your friend instead
of you. But just. Please, Max.

Miss Cross has tears in her eyes. Max goes slowly toward her.

MAX
You honestly believe that you love
Blume instead of me?

MISS CROSS
Yes.

MAX
You'll forgive me if I won't take
your word for that.

MISS CROSS
Stop. If you don't stop with that
ping-pong talk, I'm going to lose
it. Do you understand me?

Max takes Miss Cross' hand and kisses it. She pulls her hand
away. Max tries to embrace her. They struggle and Miss Cross
overpowers Max. She holds his arms behind his back.

MAX
Let me go!

Max struggles some more. Miss Cross pushes him hard across
the room. Max smashes into some chairs and knocks over a
desk. He yells at her:
MAX
I got kicked out because of you!

MISS CROSS

te
74
You got kicked out because ~~

MAX |
Rushmore was my life. Now you are!

MISS CROSS
That's bullshit!

Silence.

MISS CROSS
What do you really think is going
to happen between us? You think
we're going to have sex?

Max looks shocked.

MAX
That's kind of a cheap way to put
it, isn't it?

MISS CROSS
(pause)

Not if you've ever fucked before,
it isn't.

MAX
(stunned)
Oh, my God.

MISS CROSS
How would you put it to your
friends? Do you want to finger me?
Or maybe I could give you a hand
job in the back of a Jaguar. Would
that put an end to ail of this?

Miss Cross moves toward Max with her hand outstretched. Max

retreats backwards, banging into the desks and chairs. Miss
Cross stops.

MISS CROSS
Please. Get out of my classroom.

Max walks out of the room and stands in the doorway.

Miss Cross turns away and goes back to taking down her maps
from the wall. Max watches her for a minute.

Max leaves.
EXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY
75

Max comes out the door of the lower school in a daze. Magnus
Buchan is sitting on a bench eating some candy. He is wearing
the uniform of a green beret. He sees Max and laughs.

MAGNUS
Fischer, ya spotty fucker!

MAX
Hello, Magnus.

MAGNUS
Got any hand jobs lately?

MAX
No, I haven‘t.

Dirk appears with some of his friends.

MAGNUS
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your
Stepfather! Waitin’ for your mum so
he can get a piece.

Dirk is very embarassed. He frowns and looks at the ground,
Max stares at Magnus with bitter contempt .

MAX

Your mind is as warped as your ear,
Buchan.

MAGNUS
{standing up)
Don’t get nasty, brother.

Max breaks into a sprint straight at Magnus.

Magnus draws back and nails Max in the cheek. Max goes down
but gets right back up. They throw a flurry of punches act
each other’s faces. Some kids come running over to watch.

Max tackles Magnus around the legs. Magnus throws a hard
punch straight down at the top of Max's head. Max goes limp
and collapses to the ground.

CUT TO:

Max's eyes opening. He's lying on his back in a Pile of
leaves. A bunch of little kids have circled around him.

Max's nose bleeds profusely. One of his eyes is swollen shut.
He's got several smaller cuts all over his face. His shirt is
torn more or less in half. He looks up at Dirk standing over
him. He lifts up his hand to Dirk.
76

MAX
We got him, Dirk. We got him.
But Dirk does not take Max’s hand. He turns away.
EXT. CEMETARY. DAY

Mr. Blume spots Max sitting Indian-style at the foot of his
mother’s grave on a cold, grey day. The simple epitaph reads
Eloise Fischer, beloved wife of Bert and mother of Max.
Written below it says: the paths of glory lead but to the
grave. Mr. Blume approaches warily.

MR. BLUME
Max?

Max looks up. There is a quiet sadness about him and his
voice has lost all feeling of possibility.

MAX
Hi, Mr. Blume.

Mr. Blume stands there in silence.

MR. BLUME
You wanted to meet?

MAX
When?

MR. BLUME

Right now. You said you wanted to
put an end to this nonsense.

MAX
Oh. Yeah. I was going to try to
have that oak tree fall on you.

Max jerks his thumb over his shoulder. Mr. Blume looks at a
massive oak tree hanging precariously by the roots.

MR. BLUME
That big one? That would have really
pancaked me.

(pause)
What stopped you?

MAX
(shrugs)
What’s the point? She loves you.

Max gets up. They look at each other in silence.
MAX
So long, Mr. Blume.
Max starts to walk away. Mr. Blume calis after him:

MR. BLUME
She's my Rushmore, Max.

MAX
(without stopping)
Yeah, I know. She was mine, too.

Max leaves the cemetary. Mr. Blume stands alone. He goes over
to the tree and taps it. It comes crashing down.

TITLE:

November.
THANKSGIVING MONTAGE:

Max walks down the street with his lunch in a brown paper
bag. He goes into the barber shop. He neds hello to his
father and puts on a white barber's jacket. He has a blank,
hollow expression on his face.

Max gives an old man a haircut while the old man reads the
paper. Max gives another old man a shave. Max combs another
old man’s hair and holds up a mirror so he can see the back.

Dirk rides past the barbershop on his little French three-
speed. He circles back and looks at Max taking the trash out
to the dumpster. Max doesn't see him. Dirk pedals away.

Margaret knocks on the front door of the Fischer's house. mr.
Fischer opens the door. He and Margaret talk for a minute.
Mr. Fischer shakes his head sadly. Margaret nods.

Mr. Fischer closes the door as Margaret walks out to the
sidewalk. She looks back at the house. Max is sitting in the
window, staring off into Space. Margaret hesitates. She goes
across the yard to the window.

She taps on the glass. Max looks out at her. She waves to
him. Max closes the curtains.

Margaret turns away sadly and walks off down the sidewalk.
Max and Mr. Fischer sit in front of the TV having Tv
Thanksgiving dinners as they watch a football game. Mr.

INT. BARBERSHOP “QEVENING

There is a wreath on the door and some blinking lights are
strung-up. The last customer of the day comes out and walks
away through the snow. Mr. Fischer is Putting on his sweater
while Max washes some combs and scissors in the sink.

MR. FISCHER
It‘s been nice having your company
here at the shop, Max.

Max nods.

MR. FISCHER
Have you put any more thought into
giving school another shot?

Max shakes his head. Mr. Fischer puts on a hunting cap with
earflaps and a down parka. He zips it up. Pause.

MR. FISCHER
Max. I like being a barber. I'm
good at it and I enjoy it. But I
always thought you'd try a
different line of work.

MAX
Like what?

MR. FISCHER
I don’t know. You talked about
being a diplomat. Or a senator.

MAX
Pipe dreams, Dad. Nothing but pice
dreams. I'm a barber's son.

Max turns on the radio and goes back to washing the combs and
scissors. Mr. Fischer sighs. He puts on his gloves. He goes
out the door.

Max flips the sign on the door from open to closed. He takes
eff his barber's jacket and hangs it on the coatrack. He goes
into the back room.

He comes back into the shop carrying a broom. He stops.

Dirk is sitting in one of the barber's chairs across the
room. Silence. Max starts sweeping the floor.

MAX
{not looking at him)
Hello, Dirk.
DIRK
Hi, Max.
MAX

What can I do for you?

DIRK
I thought I might get a haircut.

MAX
We're closed.

Dirk nods. Max keeps sweeping.

DIRK
Well. I just wanted to tell you I’m
sorry I threw rocks at you that day.
(getting up)
But I guess I’1l go now.

Dirk sets a little gift-wrapped present on the counter.

DIRK
Merry Christmas.

Max steps sweeping and looks over at Dirk.

MAX
What in the hell is that?

Dirk shrugs. Max goes over to the counter and picks up the
present. He unwraps it. It is a Swiss Army Knife with an
inscription on it.

INSERT SWISS ARMY KNIFE:

Max Fischer
Rushmore Yankee
1985-1997

Max looks at the knife for a minute. He says wearily:

MAX
OK. Sit down.

Dirk sits back down in the barber's chair. Max puts his white
jacket back on and starts giving Dirk a haircut. There is
just the sound of scissors snipping for a minute.

DIRK
Have you heard the news?
80

MAX
T doubt it. I don’t really follow
the news anymore.

DIRK
Dr. Guggenheim had a stroke.

MAX
I'll send him a box of candy.

DIRK
Maybe you ought to go visit him.

Max stops snipping. Pause.

No, thanks.
Max starts snipping again.
EXT. BARBERSHOP. EVENING

Dirk comes out of the barbershop with a terrible haircut. He
waves to Max and rides off on his three-speed.

INT. BARBERSHOP. EVENING

Max waves back to Dirk. He reaches into the cooler and takes
out a bottle of Schlitz. He pops it open with the toctle
opener on the Swiss Army Knife. He drinks a sip and looks out
into the lightly falling snow. He says quietly to himself:

MAX
I always thought I'd he the one
to give him a stroke.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM. NIGHT
Dr. Guggenheim is in his hospital bed with his eyes half-shut
and a bunch of plastic tubes sticking out of him. Mrs.
Guggenheim sits in a chair at the foot of the bed reading a
biography of Churchill. She looks exhausted.
Max appears in the open doorway. He has a bouquet of violets
in his hand. He knocks.
MAX
Mrs. Guggenheim?

Mrs. Guggenhein looks up. Her face brightens and she goes to
greet Max.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
81

Hello, Max. How are you?

MAX
(desolately)
Fine, thanks.

Max starts to shake hands, but Mrs. Guggenheim hugs him and
kisses him on the cheek instead. Max is caught a little
offguard by this. There is lipstick on his cheek.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
These are glorious. Let me put
them in some water. Sit down.

She takes the flowers and points to a chair beside the bed.
Max sits down and stares at Dr. Guggenheim while Mrs.
Guggenheim puts the violets in a vase.

MAX
Should r say hello to pr. Guggen-
heim? Or can he not hear anything?

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Oh, no. He can hear you.

MAX
OK.
(sadly)
Hello, old timer. It's Max Fischer.
IT was just thinking about you the
other day. And Rushmore. And I --

Dr. Guggenheim's eyes suddenly open. Max is taken aback. Dr.
Guggenheim looks at Max suspiciously and whispers:

DR. GUGGENHEIM
What do you want?

Mrs. Guggenheim looks up quickly. Max hesitates.

MAX
I just came by to pay my respects.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
(frowns)
No, you didn't. you don't respect
anybo:

Dr. Guggenheim tries to spit at Max, but his mouth is too
dry. Mrs. Guggenheim comes over to them.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
Nelson?
82

Dr. Guggenheim mutters deliriously:

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Dammit. Goddammit.

Mrs. Guggenheim takes Dr. Guggenheim's hand and holds it. He
calms down. His eyes close and he relaxes. Silence.

Mrs. Guggenheim looks to Max.

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
That's the first thing he's said
in ten days.

Max nods. He sits quietly beside the bed.

MAX
You think he recognized me?

MRS. GUGGENHEIM
I'm not sure.

CUT TO:

Dirk hidden in the bishes across the street from the
hospital. He checks his watch. He raises his binoculars to
his eyes and looks on mysteriously as:

Mr. Blume pulls into the parking lot in his Bentley.

Dirk makes a quick notation in his spiral with a blue crayon.

INSERT NOTEBOOK:

5:25 Fischer arrives via old woman's bicycle.

INT. ELEVATOR. NIGHT

Max rides down in the elevator with a NURSE and a wheezing
OLD WOMAN in a wheelchair. The doors open in the lobby and
Max waits while the nurse wheels out the old woman.

Then he sees Mr. Blume in front of him, waiting for the
elevator. He has a bouquet of carnations in one hand and a
diet Coke in the other. He has a black eye under his
sunglasses. He is very disheveled.

MR. BLUME
Hey, amigo.

MAX
You look horrible.
83

MR. BLUME

Ygu don't look too grear yourself.
qe to see you.

MAX
You here to see Guggenheim?

MR. BLUME

MAX
(frowns)
What partner?

Silence. Mr. Blume shrugs.

MR. BLUME
OK. If you want to Play it that
way. You getting off?

MAX
T'll ride up with you.

MR. BLUME
(getting on)
Suit yourself.

Mr. Blume presses the button for the l4th floor. The doors
close and they go up. Mr. Blume takes out a little airline
bottle of vodka and pours some into his diet Coke. He swirls
it around and drinks a sip.

MAX
Who gave you the shiner?

MR. BLUME
Honestly? I don't actually know.

It was either Ronny or Donny. But
T can't tell the difference anymore.

MAX
Well, he really clocked you.

MR. BLUME
Yeah? Well. Kids don't like their
parents to get divorced.

MAX
I don't blame them.

MR. BLUME
Me, neither.

te
84

Silence.
MAX
How is she?
MR. BLUME
I wouldn't know.
MAX
Why not?
MR. BLUME
Because I haven't seen her in six
weeks.
MAX
(frowns)

What happened?
Mr. Blume shrugs.

MAX
She left you?

Mr. Blume nods.

MAX
How come? I thought she loved you,

MR. BLUME
So did I. I guess maybe I am too
old for her, after all.

MAX
(sadly)
Maybe so. Maybe so.
MR. BLUME
She's still in love with the dead
guy, anyway.
MAX

You mean Edward Appleby?

MR. BLUME
Oh, yeah. She's fucked up.

Mr. Blume lights a new cigarette. Max points to Mr. Blume's
first cigarette, balanced on the handrail.

MAX

You've already got one going, mr.
Blume.
Mr. Blume picks up his first cigarette ang puts it in the
Opposite corner of his mouth from the second. He smiles at

Max through the smoke. They get to the 14th floor and the
doors open.

MR. BLUME
Adios, amigo.

Max waves goodbye. But Mr. Blume does not get off the |
elevator. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees and
takes a series of deep breaths. The doors start to close. He
reaches out and holds them open. Max looks concerned.

MAX
Are you OK?

Mr. Blume looks up at Max. He laughs and shakes his head.

MR. BLUME
I'm kind of lonely these days.

Mr. Blume sighs. He gets off the elevator. The doors close
behind him as Max watches him walk down the hall.

CUT TO DIRK'S BINOCULARS:

Max comes out of the hospital and Stands quietly in the cold
for a minute. He gets on his mother's old bicycle. He rides
off down the street.

EXT. THE FISCHER'S HOUSE. DAY

Max opens the Fischer's garage door. His smashed-up ten-speed
hangs from a peg on the wall. He takes it down and carr:es it
out of the garage.

INT. MISS CROSS’ HOUSE. NIGHT

Miss Cross is sitting up in her bed reading Treasure Island
and listening to the radio. She is wearing pale blue pajamas.
There is a knock on her windowpane. She loe.:s up.

She hears someone trying to open the window. She gets up and
pulls open the blinds. Max is outside cn the roof wearing his
parka and ski cap in the falling snow. He waves.

MISS CROSS
Max!

Miss Cross opens the window.

MISS CROSS
What are you doing here?
86

MAX
(dazed)
I don't know. Jesus. They came at
me out of nowhere. It wag --

MISS CROSS
What?

MAX
So sudden. I just --
(pause)

I'm sorry. Can I use your phone?
I just got hit by a car.

Max points down at his destroyed ten-speed in the street
under a street lamp. Parts are scattered all around it.

MISS CROSS
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

MAX
(disoriented)

What?

Miss Cross notices a little cut over Max’s eye. She lifts up
the front of Max's ski cap. There is blood all over his
forehead. She looks shocked.

MISS CROSS
Come inside.

MAX
(climbing in)
Thank you.

Max goes to Miss Cross’ bed. He lies down and stares at the
ceiling.

Miss Cross goes into the bathroom. She puts on a white
bathrobe and gets some cotton balls and hydrogen peroxide out
of the medicine cabinet.

Max looks around the room.

MAX
So this is where it all happens.

MISS CROSS

(from the bathroom)
All what happens?

MAX
I wouldn't know.
87

Miss Cross comes back into the bedroom.

MAX
Why'd you dump Blume?

Miss Cross stops. Pause.

MISS CROSS
That's none of your business.

MAX
I know it's not. But I'ma little
confused right now. I mean. I

thought you dumped me for Blume.
Then I hear --

MISS CROSS

I never dumped you. Because we were
never going out.

MAX
But it doesn't make any sense. I --

MISS CROSS
Well, I'm confused, too. But why
don't we just deal with getting you --

MAX
Because it would help me if you
would talk to me for a minute. And
tell me what happened.

Silence.

MISS CROSS
OK.

(pause)

Well. A. He's married. And B. he
hates himself. I mean. He smashed
your bicycle, didn't he?

MAX
(pause)
My previous bicycle. res.

MISS CROSS
Well, what kind of person does
something like that?

MAX
I don't know.
(pause)
War does funny things to men.
88

Silence. Miss Cross sits down in a rocking chair beside the
bed. She opens “t bottle of hydrogen peroxide.
‘
MAX .
He thinks you dumped him because
of Edward Appleby.

MISS CROSS
What does that mean?
MAX
I don't know. I mean. You live in

his room.

Max looks around the room. There are trophies and ribbons, a
chemistry set, a poster from the Olympics, three large
fishtanks, a picture of Jacques Cousteau, and some model
planes in dogfights hanging from the ceiling.

MAX
With all his stuff. It's kind of --

MISS CROSS
I was married to him.

MAX
(pause)
I know you were.

Silence.

MISS CROSS
Although I will say Edward has more
spark and character and imagination
in one fingernail than Herman Blume
has in his entire body.

MAX
One dead fingernail.

Miss Cross fixes Max with a hard stare.

MISS CROSS
Right. One dead fingernail.

Silence.

MAX
How'd he die?

MISS CROSS
He drowned.
(pause)
How'd your mother die?
89

MAX
She got cancer.

Miss Cross nods. She sighs.

MISS CROSS
Lie still for a minute, oK?

MAX
OK.

Miss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at
him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with
a cotton ball. She stops.

MISS CROSS
Is this fake blood?

MAX
(pause)
Yes, it is.

MISS CROSS
You knew, you and Herman deserve
each other. You're little children.
Let me show you the door.

Max gets up and goes over to the window. He climbs out onto
the roof. He looks back to Miss Cross.

MAX
That wasn't a very satisfying
conversation.

Miss Cross shrugs. Silence.

MAX
All right. Goodbye, Miss Cross.

MISS CROSS
Geedbye, Max.

Max disappears into the darkness.
EXT. FROZEN POND. DAY

A few ICE SKATERS race around and do figure-8's on the little
frozen pond at the edge of town. Dirk is sitting on his
tacklebox, fishing from a hole in the ice. He stomps his
feet, and even with his mittens on he has to blow into his
hands to keep warm.

Max sits with his bare hands resting on the ice.
30

MAX
People hate me.

DIRK
That's not true.

MAX
Guggenheim tried to spit on me.
Poor old guy couldn't even spit.
And Blume and Cross?
(shakes his head)
They can't stand me. I ruined
their whole relationship.

Dirk looks down at Max's red hands.

DIRK
You should put your mittens on.

(absently)
Oh. They're already numb. I'm
suprised you don't spit on me, Dirk.

DIRK
You're my friend, Max.

Tears starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried.

MAX
I'm sorry about what I said about
your mother giving me a nand job.
I just --

DIRK
I know, Max. Listen. I'm sorry I
didn't take your hand wnen Buchan
kicked your ass.

MAX
(pause)
I got a few licks in. At the very
least, he'll think twice about
spreading that kind of garbage.

DIRK
You should stand up.

MAX
I'm awfully comfortable.
91

Silence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and
Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt
right in front of them.

The skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a
short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half
of her face. She says to Max:

SKATER
Is this your handwriting?

She holds out a little piece of paper torn from a spiral
notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written
on it in blue crayon.

INSERT PIECE OF PAPER:

Please come to the frozen pond at 3:30
PM this afternoon. Thank you very much.

Max looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook.

MAX
No. But it looks familiar.

Max gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her
scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang.

MAX
Do you know Dirk Calloway?

MARGARET
I don't think so.
MAX
Dirk, this is Margaret Yang.
Dirk nods. Margaret waves to him. Silence.
MAX
I heard about your science fair
project on Action 13 the other day.
They said the Navy was going to
buy it from you.
Margaret is polite but cold.

MARGARET
Not anymore.

MAX
Why not?

MARGARET
92

Because it was a fake.

MAX
What do you mean?

MARGARET
(sighs)
I faked all the results.
MAX
Why?
MARGARET

Because it didn't work. I thought
it would, but it didn't,

MAX

(in disbelief)
You mean it was all bullshit?

MARGARET
Not all of it. Just the parts I
didn't get right.

Max stares at her. It is as if he is seeing her for the first
time. He says quietly:

MAX
That's exactly the way I would've
handled that situation.

MARGARET
Well. It's nothing to be proud of.

MAX
But it's true.

Max is completely hypnotized by her.

MARGARET
You were a real jerk to me.

MAX
(pause)
I know. I'm sorry, Margaret.

Silence.
. MARGARET
Well. Anyway. Nice to see you.

MAX
Yeah. Nice to see you, too.
33

Margaret starts skating slowly away backwards, Max waves to
her. She spins agpund and skates off full-speed. Max watches
her go. Silence gf

MAX
You set me up.

Dirk neds. Max says wistfully:

MAX
Not bad, not bad. The child has
become the father of the man.

Max looks out across the frozen pond. He pulls off his ski
cap and feels the cold air against his cheeks. Snowflakes
catch in his eyelashes.

MAX

We might have to get some hockey
skates, Dirk.

DIRK
I already got you some.

Dirk reaches into his backpack and takes out a pair of
skates. He hands them to Max. Max looks at them for a minute.

He nods slowly. Something begins to change in his face. He
says with a quiet intensity:

MAX

Do me a favor, will you?
DIRK

Sure. What?
MAX

(pause)
Pack up your goddamn tacklebox.

Dirk smiles. Max grabs Dirk’s fishing pole and starts
walking. Dirk calls after him:

DIRK
You sure you don't want to stay
here and feel sorry for yourself?
MAX
I'll take a raincheck.
Dirk grabs his tacklebox and follows Max briskly off the ice.
EXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY
94

Mr, Blume stands cn the sidewaix in front of the barbershop.
He stares off into the distance. He has his hands in his
pockets and his hair is blowing in the wind.

Mr. Fischer is inside reading the sports page.

A cab pulls up and splashes water on Mr. Blume, but he does
not appear to notice. Max gets out of the cab. He is dressed
in a beautiful green velvet suit and a bowtie. He smiles.

MAX
Thanks for meeting me, Mr. Blume.

MR. BLUME
What can I do for you?

Max hands Mr. Blume a little white cardboard box. Mr. Blume
frowns.

MR. BLUME
What’s this?

Max shrugs. Mr. Blume starts to open the box. Max flinches
away like the box is going to explode. Mr. Blume stops. Max
smiles and motions for Mr. Blume to go ahead. Mr. Blume opens
the box. There are two little pins inside.

MAX
That's the Perfect Attendance Award
and the Punctuality Award. I got
those at Rushmore. I thought you
could choese which one you like
more, and you could wear that one
and I could wear the other.

Mr. Blume’s face softens. He nods slowly. He studies the Pins
and says quietly:

MR. BLUME
I'll take Punctuality.

MAX
OK.

They put the pins in their lapels.

MR. BLUME
Thank you.

Max nods. He smiles.

MAX
Come on. Let's go inside.

Mr. Blume, this is my father, Bert
Fischer.

Silence. Mr. Blume nods slowly.

MR. BLUME
Nice to meet you, Mr. Fischer.

MR. FISCHER

Mr. Fischer's my father’s name.
Call me Bert.

MR. BLUME

OK, Bert.

MR. FISCHER
Max tells me you could use a haircut.

Mr. Blume hesitates.

Mr. Blume sits down in one of the

get Mr. Blume a cup of coffee?

EXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

Max and Mr. Blume come out of the barbershop and walk quickly
down the sidewalk. Mr. Blume's hair is crisply cut and nearly
combed, but his clothes still look very disheveled.

MAX
How much are you worth, by the way?

MR. BLUME
I don't know.

MAX
Over ten million?

MR. BLUME
Yeah. I guess so.

Good, good.

MR. BLUME
Why?

MAX
Cause we're going to need all of it.

Blume's office. Ernie runs the projector.

Max and Mr. Blume visit a marine research facility. mr. Blume
holds up a fish at the edge of a pool. A killer whale jumps
out of the water and takes it in its teeth.

Max and Mr. Blume sprint down the street and through the park
in warm-up suits. They hurdle bushes and dodge traffic. They
run inte an empty footbail stadium and race up the bleachers.

Max and Dirk skate around on the frozen pond doing
complicated tricks and jumps.

EXT. VACANT LOT. DAY

A large crowd of Rushmore students, Parents, and faculty has
gathered around the vacant lot beside the baseball field. a

huge banner says The Cousteau-Blume Marine Observatory. There
is a bulldozer and a cement truck at the back of the lot.

Max and Mr. Blume shake hands for the yearbook photographer.
Mr. Blume is holding a gold shovel with a ribbon around it.

MR. BLUME
She's not coming, is she?

MAX
(pause)
It doesn't look good.

MR. BLUME
Ah, shit, man. What the hell am I
doing here?

Mr. Blume throws down his shovel and starts to walk off. Max
yells at him:

MAX
Dammit, Blume! How the hell did
you ever get so rich? you're a
quitter!

Mr. Blume looks back at Max in shock.

MR. BLUME
This cost me eight million dollars!

MAX
(hesitates)
And that's all you're prepared to
spend?

Silence.

EXT. THE FISCHER'S HOUSE. DAY

Max carries an old leather typewriter case into the backyard.
He sets it down on a picnic table. The case has an inscrip-
tion on it in gold letters.

INSERT TYPEWRITER CASE:

Bravo, Max! Love, Mom.
Max unzips the case. There is an old portable manual
typewriter inside. Max rolls a piece of Paper into it and
starts typing furiously. He pauses to drink a sip of hot
chocolate. He starts typing again.

EXT. WEBSTER auger SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. DAY

Webster Smalley is Rushmore’s sister school. The doors to the .
lower school burst open and twenty-five first-grade girls in
plaid jumpers run yelling onto the playground.

Miss Cross comes out of the building after the girls. She
sees Max coming down the hill in his green suit.

MISS CROSS
I like your new suit.

MAX
Thanks.

MISS CROSS

Is that velvet?

Max nods. Miss Cross feels his lapel. It has his Perfect
Attendance Award pin in it.

MAX
Sorry you couldn't make it to our
little groundbreaking the other
day. It's kind of a shame, since
he's building it for you.

MISS CROSS
Well, you know, I never asked any-
body to build me an aquarium. I'm
not sure how that rumor got started.

MAX
Hm. Me, neither. You think Edward
Appleby would've built you one?

Miss Cross thinks for a minute. She sounds suprised at her
own response:

MISS CROSS
Yeah. He probably would've. If he
had the money.

(smiles)

That's what I thought. Blume's got
a little more spark and vitality
than you expected, doesn't he?

MISS CROSS
But the aquarium was your idea.

Max smiles and shrugs his shoulders.

MAX
Well, I gave it to my friend,

Max turns and starts walking away. He looks back over his
shoulder and says:

MAX
By the way, I still haven't fucked
anybody yet. But I guess that's
just the way it goes.
Miss Cross smiles sadly.
INSERT TEACHERS' MAILBOXES:

A cabinet of little slots where teachers get their mail and
memos. Someone puts a little envelope into the slot marked
Rosemary Cross.

INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

Max stands at the counter in a huge construction supply
warehouse. A SALESMAN says:

SALESMAN
Fifteen sticks?

MAX
Yes, please. And make the order
out to Ready Demolition, Tuscon.
Max holds up a driver's license. The salesman looks at it and
writes something on a clipboard. Max walks out ef the
warehouse with several large boxes over his shoulder. The
boxes say DYNAMITE on them in large red letters.

EXT. STREET. DAY

Dirk comes out of a hiding place in the bushes as Max walks
over with the dynamite. Dirk is holding a pellet gun.

MAX
Make sure these don't get wet.

Max hands Dirk the boxes and takes the pellet gun.

MAX
I'll see you at 3:15.

Max starts walking away down the sidewalk.
100

DIRK
Where you going?

MAX
(without stopping)
Rushmore. I got one last piece
of unfinished business I got to
attend to.

EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY

Max pumps his pellet gun about twenty times. He raises the
stock to his shoulder as Magnus Buchan walks onto the
quadrangle. He draws a bead on him and follows him in his
sights as he passes by. He fires.

Magnus screams and grabs his only good ear. He spins around
and sees Max cocking his pellet gun.

MAGNUS
Fischer! Ya fuck!

MAX
Hello, Magnus. I’d have shot you
in the other ear, but it got blown
off a long time ago.
Magnus starts to come at Max. Max points his weapon at him.

MAX
Not so fast.

Magnus stops.

MAX
I owed you that one. Now we’re
even.

MAGNUS

(smiles crookedly)
Not for long, kemosabe.

MAX
(shrugs)
We'll see.

Silence. Max holds Magnus at gunpoint.

MAX
I got a proposition for you.

MAGNUS
Shove it up your mother's arse,
ya little prick.
101

MAX
I got to hand it to you, Magnus.
You‘ve got a way with words. You
want to be in a play?

MAGNUS
(puzzled) .
Don't piss with me, Fischer.

MAX
I'm not pissing with you.
(reaching in his backpack)
I brought you a script.

Max hands Magnus a script with a red cover.

MAGNUS
What's all this shite?

MAX
Nothing. I just think you're right
for the part.

Magnus stares at Max. He says quietly:

MAGNUS
I always wanted to be in one of
those frickin’ plays of yours.

MAX
I know you did, mate.

Magnus looks at the script.
INSERT COVER OF PLAY:

Guggenheim in his wheelchair, Mrs. Guggenheim, Mrs. Calloway,
Mrs. Whitney, the Indian groundskeeper, the yearbook
photographer, Coach Beck, Ernie, Mr. Holstead, Mr. Adams, the
police who arrested Max, some old men from the barbershop.

Miss Cross‘ friend John, whom Max humiliated at dinner after
the Serpico play, is seated in the third row. He is dressed
in a coat and tie.

An USHER directs Miss Cross to her seat. She is surprised to
see that it is right next to Mr. Blume’s. She reluctantly
sits down beside him. Mr. Blume sees her.

MISS CROSS
Hi, Herman.

Mr. Blume nods. He pulls his ticket out of his inside pecket
and checks the seat number. He looks to Miss Cross. Miss
Cross smiles.

MISS CROSS
Looks like Max pulled a fast one
on us.
Mr. Blume nods.
MISS CROSS
How's your aquarium coming along?
MR. BLUME
Not too bad. It should be finished
in October.
Miss Cross nods.
MR. BLUME

I just made a deal with a guy in

Singapore for half a dozen electric
eels.

MISS CROSS
That sounds good.

The lights go down. A spotlight appears and Max walks onstage

in a tuxedo. He goes to a microphone in the middle of the
stage.

MAX
I don’t usually do this, but this
Play means a lot to me, and I wanted
to make a dedication. So I'll just
say that this play is dedicated to
the memory of my mother, Eloise
Fischer. And to Edward Appleby. A
friend of a friend.

Neither Mr. Fischer nor Miss Cross were expecting this
announcement, and they are moved by it.
MAX
iso you'll find a pair of safety
sses and some ear plugs underneath
your seats. Please feel free to use
them. Thank you very much.

Max exits the stage and the audience applauds. There is a
moment of rustling and whispering in the dark theatre.

Then the curtain opens on:
vietnam. Napalm smolders in the sky above the jungle.

Dirk runs onstage dressed in a green beret uniform and

sunglasses. He has an M-16. He yells to Max as Max shimmies
down cut of a palm tree:

DIRK
Let‘s reck, Esposito!

MAX
Lock and load, Surf Boy!

There is an explosion and Max and Dirk run through the smoke.

Suddenly the stage is swarmed by VC regulars. Everyone starts
shooting at once.

Bursts of gunfire light-up the audience’s faces and smoke
floats over their heads as we hear the sounds of jets flying

over, bombs exploding, choppers taking off, and a scldier’s
voice screaming into his radio:

SOLDIER
Mayday! Mayday! Seven niner
Almighty! Adjust your coordinates!
Some members of the audience put on their safety glasses and

earplugs. Woody stands nervously in the wings with a fire
extinguisher.

One of the extras accidentally clubs Max in the temple with
the butt of his rifle. Max's eyes close. He crumples to the
floor. The fighting stops. The audience begins to murmur.

Max opens his eyes. He sees the frightened soldiers looking
down at him.

He grabs his M-16 and opens fire. The battle resumes.
INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY:

Intermission.

The sign is leaning on an easel in front of the curtain.
Little roses and tulips are painted around its edges.

INT. DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT

Actors run around frantically backstage. Max has a band-aid
on his forehead. He is touching-up a gory makeup effect over
Dirk’s eye. He turns to Woody.

MAX
How much time we got, Wood?

WOODY
(checks his watch)
Two minutes.

MAX
Bring me some more ketchup.
(points to the band-aid on his head)
And make this look real.

EXT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT

The lobby of the auditorium is buzzing with people talking
about the play and having drinks.

Mr. Blume is standing alone outside, smoking a cigarette. It
is snowing softly. Miss Cross comes out with a cup of coffee
in each hand. Mr. Blume turns around and looks at her.

She goes over to him and hands him one of the coffees.

MR. BLUME
(sadly)
Thank you.

MISS CROSS
Hold this one, too, Herman.

He holds both coffees while Miss Cross pours some little
containers of cream into them and stirs them with a Plastic
straw. She takes back her cup of coffee.

MISS CROSS
So what do you think of Max’s
latest opus?
Mr. Blume gives a thumbs up and stares out into the snow.

MR. BLUME
Let's just hope it’s got a happy
ending.
105

Miss Cross smiles. She smoothes her hand across Mr. Blume’s
hair. He looks into her eyes. She links arms with him gently
and they drink their coffees together.

INT. AUDITORIUM. NIGHT

Max and Magnus Buchan, with a three-day beard and a cigar,
stand together among the fallen bodies and smoldering trees.

MAX
I want you to have something, Sarge.

Max hands Magnus Mr. Blume’s silver .45 automatic.

MAX
I won‘t be needing it anymore.

MAGNUS
Semper fi, Esposito. Semper fi.

MAX
Sic transit gloria, sir.

Max looks out to Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume looks back at him.

MAX
Say a prayer for Surf Bey. Wherever
he is.

MAGNUS

Good luck, soldier.

Magnus salutes Max and walks off. We hear his voice as he
goes into the wings:

MAGNUS
Tag ‘em and bag ‘em, cherr:es!
We’‘re moving out! Let’s DD!

Max throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry
quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling
smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife.

But then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese
villager. She has been through hell.

MARGARET
Hello, Esposito.

Max drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out
his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her.

Miss Cross smiles sadly.
106

Max looks into Margaret Yang's eyes.

MAX
Will you marry me, Le~-Chahn?

MARGARET
(instantly)
You bet I will.

Wagner’s Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from
behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops
to wild applause.

Mrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim
stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the evation. The
rest of the audience quickly follows suit.

The Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically.
INT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT

The gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated
like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the

tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell
Cotillion.

Dirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some
vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of
the Army barracks motif.

Miss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl.

MISS CROSS
Max sent you an invitation?

JOHN
Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie.

Max and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with
Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG.

MAX
Thank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually
wrote a different version of the
story two years ago. But I couldn't
get it done over at Rushmore.

MRS. YANG
Why? Too political?

MAX
No. A kid got his finger blown off
during rehearsals.
107

Max sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching.

MAX
Miss Cross, this is my father,
Bert Fischer. He's a barber.
(to Mr. Fischer)
This is my friend Rosemary Cross.

Mr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands.

MR. FISCHER
Hi, Rosemary.

MISS CROSS
Nice to finally meet you, Bert.

MAX
And, of course, you know Mr. Blume.
I also want everyone to meet Mr.
and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret.

Miss Cross and Margaret smile at each other.

MISS CROSS
Hello, Margaret.

MARGARET
Hello, Miss Cross.

The Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr.
Blume's foreman, Ernie.

COACH BECK
I'm surprised they let him build a
real campfire onstage. That's a
safety hazard.

ERNIE
Well, last year he tried to raise
Ppiranhas.

COACH BECK

What'd you think, Mr. Littlejeans?

GROUNDSKEEPER
Best play all year, man.

Mr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook
photographer are having a conversation.

MAGNUS
Well, Fischer stepped on half my
bleedin’ lines.

Are Ronny and Donny having a good
time at military school?

MR. BLUME
(instantly)
They love it.

MAGNUS
Lucky bastards.

Mr. Fischer is talking with John.

JOHN
I understand you're a neurosurgeon.

MR. FISCHER
No. I'm a barber. But a lot of
people make that mistake.

Mr. Fischer laughs.

Dirk and Dr. Guggenheim watch Max laughing and dancing with
Margaret Yang. Max points to Dr. Guggenheim. Dr.
smiles and points back to him. He says in a hoarse whisper:

DR. GUGGENHEIM
Who's the Chinaman with Fischer?

DIRK
That's Margaret Yang. She's actually
Korean.

DR. GUGGENHEIM
(pleasantly surprised)
I know the Koreans. They're good
people.

Max and Margaret are talking as they dance:

MAX
You were incredible tonight, Mar-
garet. You were that poor girl.

MARGARET
Thank you. I loved it when you
grabbed onto the bottom of the
chopper as it was taking off.

MAX
Margaret nods.

109

That was totally improvised.

They look at each other smiling.

MAX

Can I ask you a question?
MARGARET

Of course.
MAX

Can you do an Australian accent?

Margaret looks puzzled. Max smiles.

MAX
I'm working on something that's
set in the outback.

Mr. Fischer is sitting at a table having a glass of champagne
with Max's math teacher, Mrs. Whitney. She has a slight
English accent. Mr. Fischer wears a sky blue blazer.

MR. FISCHER
That’'s a beautiful dress, by the way.

MRS. WHITNEY
Why, thank you, Bert. That sportscoat
is rather smashing in its own right.

MR. FISCHER
I know it's a little loud. But I feel
like celebrating.

MRS. WHITNEY
Would you care to dance?

MR. FISCHER
(surprised)
I'd love to.

Mr. Blume brings Miss Cross a glass of champagne as Max and
Margaret dance by.

MARGARET
Hello, Mr. Blume!

MR. BLUME
Hi, Margaret!
{to Max)
May I cut in? I haven't had a
chance to cut a rug with your new
girlfriend yet.
110

MAX
(embarassed)
New girlfriend.

MARGARET
Yes, I am. And find your own dance
Partner, Mr. Blume. No offense, but
I'm spoken for.

MAX
No, it's OK. He's my friend.

Margaret and Mr. Blume dance off together. Max and Miss Cross
are left alone.

MISS CROSS
Well, you pulled it off.

MAX
(shrugs)
It went OK. At least nobody got
hurt.

MISS CROSS
Except for you.

MAX
(smiles sadly) .
Nah. I didn't get hurt that bad.

Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross sips her champagne. She
looks back at Max for a minute. She smiles. Mr. Fischer cells
out to them as he dances by with Mrs. Whitney:

MR. FISCHER
Come on, you two! Shake a leg!

They wave to Mr. Fischer. Miss Cross looks to Max.

MISS CROSS
You want to dance?

MAK
Certainly. But let's see if we
can get the DJ to play something
with a little --

Max snaps his fingers. He turns to the DJ and yells:

MAX
Reuben!

The DJ looks to Max. Max makes a little gesture that seems to
say, This is the one. The DJ nods.
dil

The music cuts off in the middle of the song. Everyone stops
dancing. They look around wondering what's going on.

A new song starts up. It is the saddest song of the night.
Max looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross puts out her hand. Max

takes it and walks with her onto the dance floor, into the
crowd, as everyone slowly begins to dance.
