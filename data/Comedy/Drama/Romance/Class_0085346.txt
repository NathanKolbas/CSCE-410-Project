INT. CAFE — DAY
The first morning of the new school year.

In a Paris café, leaning on the bar, FRANCOIS, 35 or so,
peacefully sips coffee. In the background, we can vaguely
make out a conversation about the results of the
presidential election. Frangois looks at his watch and
seems to take a deep breath as if stepping onto a stage.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Frangois comes out of the café. Across the street, we
discover a large building whose slightly outdated fagade
is not particularly welcoming. He walks over to the
imposing entrance that bears the shield of the City of
Paris in wrought iron and beneath which we read “JAURES
MIDDLE SCHOOL”. On the opposite sidewalk, coming from the
other end of the street, a small group of teachers
hurries towards the entrance. Frangois hears them joking.

VINCENT
He’s a really great guy, not the back-
slapping type but...

Frangois greets them in passing.

INT. CORRIDORS - SCHOOL - DAY

We discover the school’s deserted corridors. Through the
doorway of a classroom, Frangois sees a few cleaners who,
in a very calm atmosphere, clean the tables and line them
up neatly, wash the windows.. A short distance further on,
a man in overalls applies one last coat of paint to an
administrative notice board.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

Around the principal in the meeting room, the teachers,
old or new, introduce themselves briefly, as in a casting
session.

HERVE
Hello, everybody, I'm Hervé. I’ve been at
the school three years now. I teach
sports. I’d like to welcome all our new
colleagues. The students can be tough but
they're good kids. There you go.
OLIVIER
Hello, everybody, I'm Olivier. I teach
physical science and I've been here for 4
years.

PATRICK
I'm Patrick and I teach multiplication
tables, and occasionally mathematics!
I've been at this school for a number of
years.

ANNE
Hello, I'm Anne. I used to work in the
Lyon suburbs, in Bron to be precise, and
I teach English. I'm looking for my new
colleagues. Hello...

ISABELLE
Hello, I’m Isabelle...

ANNE
Pleased to meet you. Hello...

CHRISTIANE
I’m Christiane...

FREDERIC
I'm Frédéric, I teach history and
geography and I used to work out in the
suburbs of Paris, in Aulnay-sous-Bois if
anyone knows it. I'm happy to be in the
city now.

JULIE
Hello, I'm Julie, the year supervisor.
I'd like to welcome you all and wish you
a good year.

ALINE
Hello, I'm Aline, I'm the cook and I'd
like to welcome you all.

VINCENT
Thank you, Aline.

GILLES
Hello, everyone. I'm Gilles, I've been
teaching mathematics for many years now.
I'm retiring at the end of this year. I'd
like to wish the new arrivals plenty of
courage.
FRANCOIS
I'm Frangois. I teach French and I'm
starting my fourth year here. Welcome,
everybody.

Then the principal hands out the timetables, eliciting a
few sighs of satisfaction or disappointment.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the staff room, a new arrival listens to the succinct
comments of an older member of staff, OLIVIER, on the
different students in a second-year class as he runs
through a list.

OLIVIER
Nice, nice, not nice, not nice at all...
He's nice, not nice, watch him, not nice
at all, nice, not nice, she's not nice at
all.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

The children noisily enter the glass as Frangois looks
on. The students take their places in general confusion,
the girls on one side, the boys on the other. They show
each other their new gear: pencil cases, brand-name
exercise books.. Frangois, clearly used to this kind of
agitation, raises his voice.

FRANCOIS
All right, all right, all right! Hey,
hey, hey! Calm down now! Stop stirring
things up there and remove your hood,
please. You two back there, there's a
place here. One of you comes up front.

Things start to calm down.

FRANCOIS
Right, let's get one thing clear from the
word go.. Hey! I want to get this clear
from the start. We waste five minutes
lining up outside, five coming up, five
settling down: fifteen minutes out of an
hour. Do you realize what fifteen lost
minutes means? With twenty-five hours a
week and thirty weeks in the year, we
lose thousands of minutes. In other
schools, they do a full hour. Imagine how
far ahead they get in a year. Figure it
out!
KHOUMBA, a girl with long hair in the style of Diana
Ross, speaks up without raising her hand first.

KHOUMBA
We never do an hour!
FRANCOIS
Put your hand up to speak. What is it?
KHOUMBA
We never do an hour. You always say that.
FRANCOIS
What do you mean, “we never do an hour”?
KHOUMBA
Teachers say we do an hour's class but we
never do.
FRANCOIS
Yes.
KHOUMBA

We never do an hour's class. We start at
8.30 and finish at 9.25. That doesn't
make an hour.

FRANCOIS
All right, it's fifty-five minutes.
Thanks, that's an important point.

KHOUMBA
But we never do an hour. Stop saying
other schools do an hour. They don't
either.

FRANCOIS

All right, all I'm saying is that we
waste time. Like right now. To start
with, take out a sheet of paper, fold it
in two so that it can stand on the edge
of your desk clearly and, using block
capitals, write your full name on it.

While BOUBACAR sluggishly obeys, WEY, in the front row,
translates the instructions into Chinese for his neighbor
and shows her how to do it. A few rows behind them,
ESMERALDA, Khoumba’s friend and neighbor, butts in.

ESMERALDA
Why do we have to write our names?

FRANCOIS
So I can get to know who you are.
ESMERALDA
But you know us!

LOUISE
We had you last year.

FRANCOIS
Esmeralda, I don't know if you've
noticed, but half of the kids here are
new. So it can help. Be happy. This way,
people will know your name.

ESMERALDA
I'm not doing it.

FRANCOIS
Cut it out.

ESMERALDA

I won't if you don't.

FRANCOIS
Ah, you have a point. For those of you
who don't know me, I'm Mr. Marin.

ESMERALDA

Ms. Marin.
BOUBACAR

Hey, are you a marine?
SOULEYMANE

He wiped you out, that’s wicked.
FRANCOIS

Very funny.
BOUBACAR

He didn’t wipe you out, he busted you.

FRANCOIS
Come on, it shouldn't take so long. You
should be a lot quicker. Five minutes to
write a name. That's ridiculous!

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

SOPHIE, in passing, offers a biscuit to RACHEL and
Frangois who is sitting nearby.

SOPHIE
A biscuit for the first day?
FRANCOIS
I'm okay, thanks.

ANNE
I wouldn’t mind one.

SOPHIE
Rachel, a biscuit will buck you up.

RACHEL
Thanks.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

On the board, Frangois writes the words that the students
haven't understood in the text that they are studying. A
slightly affected student raises his hand.

FRANCOIS
All right... "Witty". That's a word we'll
try to explain later. Are there any other
words in the text that you don't
understand? Burak.

BURAK
The word "condescension".

Frangois notes the word on the board, just under other
more or less complicated words. He turns to the class.

FRANCOIS
The word "condescension", yes, that's a

complicated word. Do you have any idea,

Burak, what that might mean? Any idea at
all?

BURAK
A vague idea but I'm not sure.

FRANCOIS
You're not sure? All right, we'll talk
about that later then. Yes, Damien?

DAMIEN
"Argentite".

FRANCOIS
Argentite. What does that mean?

DAMIEN
It's people who live in Argentina.
FRANCOIS
Right, exactly, the inhabitants of
Argentina.

ESMERALDA
Wow, what a moron! Wicked!

FRANCOIS
Argentites and Argentitesses.. No, of
course not. Damien, who lives in
Argentina?

DAMIEN
The Argentites.

FRANCOIS
No, you know that's not right, you watch
soccer on TV. Argentina's players are
called...

DAMIEN
Footballers.

SOULEYMANE
Oh, what a big kid!

A discreet-looking student raises her hand.

FRANCOIS
Let's move on. Any other difficult words
in this text? Henriette? Is there
anything that you didn't understand? I
imagine there is.

HENRIETTE
“Henceforth”.

FRANCOIS
"Henceforth". Thanks for the prompt,
Samantha. All right! I think that will
do. Let's take a look at these words. All
right. "Austrian".. Wey was the one who
picked the word "Austrian". Yes,
Esmeralda.

ESMERALDA
I mean, we all know what "Austrian" is.
People from Austria.

FRANCOIS
Okay, but Wey doesn't know and, well,
Austrian isn't really...
ESMERALDA
Maybe, but he's the only one, everyone
else knows!

FRANCOIS

Okay, we get the message. You didn't know
"misleading", so you're not really in any
position to talk about all that. We agree
on that?

ESMERALDA
Yes, but everyone knows what "Austrian"
means! It's easy.

FRANCOIS

Look here, nobody's perfect. Besides,
"Austrian" is not a very important word.
It refers to someone from the land of
Austria, which is a pretty tiny country.
We can live without the word. For
example, can anyone name a famous
Austrian?

Not one hand is raised.

BOUBACAR
Mozart. “Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart.

FRANCOIS
What do you call him?

BOUBACAR
“Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart.

FRANCOIS

He could have been "Wolfang" maybe if he
were English, not Austrian. Mozart was
Austrian, yes, but do you know any other
famous Austrians? So, basically, Austria
could vanish from the map and no one
would notice. But, seriously, it's a
country south of Germany. So check a map,
Wey. You'll see where it is. Souleymane,
can you note the words too, like everyone
else?

Frangois’ blatant insincerity inspires a few collusive
smiles in the class. Wey is delighted to have understood
that his teacher is joking.

SOULEYMANE
I forgot my things.
FRANCOIS
And no one can lend you some paper so you
can do it?

SOULEYMANE
No, it’s okay, I'll do it at home.

FRANCOIS
You'll do it at home. Sure you will.
That's your approach. Not a stroke of
work in class and everything done at
home.

SOULEYMANE
I'm serious. Don’t worry, it’1l be okay,
it’1l be okay... Thanks.

Souleymane, convinced that he has had the last word,
seems fairly pleased with himself. Frangois turns to the
list of words on the board again.

FRANCOIS
All right, let's move on to "succulent".
"Succulent" is a word that we'll try to
guess the meaning of. What's in
"succulent"? Suck...

BOUBACAR
Suck off!

ESMERALDA
Jerk.

FRANCOIS

Very funny, Boubacar. Very witty indeed.

SOULEYMANE
He should be sent out for that, sir.

FRANCOIS
I'll give you a sentence with
"succulent". Bill enjoys a succulent
cheeseburger.

On either side of the word on the board, he writes a
sentence: “Bill enjoys a succulent cheeseburger.” And he
underlines the word “succulent”. A voice speaks out
behind him.

CHERIF
Cheeseburgers are crap, they stink.

FRANCOIS
Who said that?
10.

RABAH
Cheeseburgers are the best.

CHERIF
I said it. Why a cheeseburger?

FRANCOIS
Well, since you say they stink, that
means you think cheeseburgers aren't
succulent.

CHERIF
I don’t care, but cheeseburgers are crap.

FRANCOIS
All right, but what I mean is, what I
just said about cheeseburgers should have
made the penny drop.

Those who know become more and more impatient.

ANGELICA
Sir, sir, what does that mean?

FRANCOIS
What does what mean?

ANGELICA
The penny thing...

FRANCOIS
"To make the penny drop." That should
make the penny drop. No one knows the
expression?

STUDENT (0.S.)
A clue.

FRANCOIS
That's it. If the penny drops, it means
you're given a clue. When I say if Cherif
thinks cheeseburgers stink, it means he
doesn't think they're succulent, that
should help you see what "succulent"

means.
KHOUMBA
What's with the Bills?
FRANCOIS
What bills?
KHOUMBA

Not bills, the name Bill.
11.

ESMERALDA
Bill and Ben.

KHOUMBA
You always use weird names. Why don’t you
use...

FRANCOIS

It's not a weird name. A recent US
President was called Bill, remember.

KHOUMBA
Why don't you use Aissata or Rachid or
Ahmed or...
ESMERALDA
You always use whitey names. It’s wicked.
FRANCOIS
What names?
ESMERALDA
Honky names.
FRANCOIS

What's a honky?

ESMERALDA
Honkies, Frenchies, frogs.

Frangois seems a little put out, as if he had been trying
to avoid this kind of discussion.

FRANCOIS
You're not French, Esmeralda?

ESMERALDA
No, I'm not French.

FRANCOIS
Really? I didn't know.

ESMERALDA
Well, I am French, but I’m not proud of
it.

FRANCOIS

Fine, I'm not either, actually.

ESMERALDA
Wiped him out!
12.

FRANCOIS
Neither am I, in fact, I’m not proud to
be French either.

KHOUMBA
Why do you use these names then?

FRANCOIS
Khoumba, if I start choosing names to
suit your different ethnic origins, it'll
never end.

KHOUMBA & ESMERALDA
But change them a bit..

STUDENT (0.S.)
Yeah, Bill, Ben, Bob..

KHOUMBA & ESMERALDA
Change them a bit.

FRANCOIS
So what do you suggest?

KHOUMBA & ESMERALDA
Er, Aissata...

STUDENT (0.S.)
Mamadou, Bintou...

KHOUMBA & ESMERALDA
Fatou. No, Aissata. Aissata!
INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the depths of his locker, Frangois finds a mandarin
orange that seems to have been there for some time.

Frédéric comes to sit down next to Frangois, a coffee in
his hand.

FREDERIC
Excuse me. Do you have class 4/3 in
French?

FRANCOIS

Yes, I'm the class supervisor too.

FREDERIC
Do you already know what book you'll be
reading?
13.

FRANCOIS
No, I haven't decided yet.

FREDERIC
Because in history, I'll be starting with
the Ancien Régime. If you want to link
into that, what kind of books are there?

FRANCOIS
Well, there's the Enlightenment but
that’s tough for them in their year.

FREDERIC

How about Voltaire? Is he tough?
FRANCOIS

Well, he's not easy.
FREDERIC

I don't know. "Candide" is an easy read...
FRANCOIS

Not in their year.
FREDERIC

“Zadig"..
FRANCOIS

Yes, maybe, but it’d be tough.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

Frangois has bags under his eyes and seems to be having a
bad day. Behind him, on the board, a verb is conjugated
in the imperfect tense. The verb endings have been
underlined.

The whole class, silent, works on an exercise. Frangois
seems to be miles away. His weary gaze sweeps over the
class. All of a sudden, he speaks.

FRANCOIS
Okay, in 20 seconds, we correct it.

BOUBACAR
No, sir, please! We haven't finished.

With some sweeping gestures, DALLA asks Rabah, in the
opposite row, for the time. Rabah starts to reply with
equally exaggerated gestures. Frangois seems to snap out
of his daze and answers curtly.
14.

FRANCOIS

We can't spend two hours on the
imperfect. Dalla, you can ask me for the
time if you want.

With an involuntary wink, she signals to NASSIM whose pen
has leaked over his jacket. Frangois, on discovering the
scene, raises his eyes to the heavens in exasperation.

NASSIM
Sir, this crap pen keeps leaking! It's
getting on my nerves.

FRANCOIS
Who has a handkerchief for..

Rabah takes a tissue out of his pocket and stands to take
it to Nassim.

RABAH
Me!

FRANCOIS
Rabah, Rabah... Ask before you stand, okay.

Rabah sits back down.

RABAH
May I?

In passing, Rabah trips over his neighbor's bag and stops
himself from falling by grabbing Juliette’s shoulder,
sprawling over her exaggeratedly. She pushes him away
roughly.

FRANCOIS
Yes. Gently, okay.

BOUBACAR
The perv! He touched her tits! The perv!

FRANCOIS
Come on, just give him the handkerchief!
Boubacar, spare us your comments.

SOULEYMANE (0.S.)
Goddam pedophile! You big kid!

ESMERALDA
Sir, sir.

FRANCOIS
Okay, okay... Quiet!
15.

SOULEYMANE (0.S.)
You ain’t got a chick or what? You need
to press up against chicks, Rabah!

FRANCOIS
Hey, take it easy!

Only Esmeralda doesn’t burst out laughing. She seems
bothered by something. As she thinks, she ends up asking
her question.

FRANCOIS
(to Esmeralda)
Yes...
ESMERALDA
Sir, why do they say the imperfect
indicative?

SOULEYMANE (0.S.)
If you want chicks, let me know, I’11l
give you contacts.

Frangois seems happy that Esmeralda is so motivated. He
speaks to her with gentleness.

FRANCOIS
Quiet, Souleymane! All right, Esmeralda,
why the indicative?

She raises her eyes to the heavens.

ESMERALDA
You're pushing it! If I knew, I wouldn't
ask!

FRANCOIS
I can imagine. How about the others? Does
anyone know why we specify the imperfect
indicative? Why not just the imperfect?
Nassim.

NASSIM
Do you mind if I go wash my hands
because...

FRANCOIS

Go on, wash them and get it over with.

STUDENT (0.S.)
He’s gonna visit the corridors.

FRANCOIS
Make it quick!
16.

STUDENT (0.S.)
He'll be back in a week! I’m going with
him!

FRANCOIS

All right, enough! If we talk
specifically about the imperfect
indicative, that means it's different
than another imperfect. Which imperfect
is that? Agam?

AGAM answers calmly.

AGAM
The imperfect subjunctive.

FRANCOIS

Exactly. The imperfect subjunctive. Can
anyone give me an example of the
imperfect subjunctive? I don't believe
it, Khoumba, go on.

KHOUMBA
Hold on, I may be wrong...

Frangois gives her an encouraging smile.

FRANCOIS
Yes, I think so too.
KHOUMBA
I were.
FRANCOIS
I were. Of course, from the verb "to
werr"?
KHOUMBA
No, I were.. I don’t know.
ESMERALDA
I wuz.
KHOUMBA
No, I were, you were, you were, they
were...
FRANCOIS

All right. That's not bad but you use it
wrongly. You vaguely recall the imperfect
subjunctive. Imagine I say: "He insists
that I be" - let's say - "in shape." What
is "be" in that example? Eva?
17.

EVA
The present subjunctive.

FRANCOIS
Very good. For the imperfect subjunctive,
we follow the sequence of tenses and use
a past: "He insisted..."

BOUBACAR

He insisted... he insisted that I be.
FRANCOIS

"He insisted that I..." Khoumba?
KHOUMBA

Were.
FRANCOIS

Were, yes!
ESMERALDA

You really think I'll tell my mom. "He
insisted that I were'd been in shape?"
And that she'll understand?

FRANCOIS
Not "I were'd been". Learn to use it
before you start complaining.

ESMERALDA
He insisted that I were'd been in shape.

FRANCOIS
"That I were in shape". Use the sequence
of tenses.

ESMERALDA
But no one says that in real life, it's
true, it's true!

KHOUMBA
I was right! "I were"!

FRANCOIS
All right, will you let me answer the
question that you asked me? If you care.

ESMERALDA
Yes, you may.
18.

FRANCOIS
The first thing I notice is, before
mastering something, the imperfect
subjunctive, you're already telling me
it's no use. Start by mastering it, then
you can call its use into question.

ESMERALDA

Sir, why are you criticizing us?
FRANCOIS

What?
ANGELICA

They're right, it's not the way people
talk now, that's the way they talked in
the old days. Even my gran didn't say
that.

BOUBACAR
Or your great granddad. It's from the
Middle Ages!

FRANCOIS
No, it’s not from the Middle Ages and for
starters

BOUBACAR
It is!

ESMERALDA
Of course it is!

KHOUMBA
It's bourgeois.

ANGELICA
Tell me, when was the last time you heard
someone talk like that? When was the last
time you heard someone talk like that?

FRANCOIS
Yesterday, with friends, we used the
imperfect subjunctive...
(he is briefly interrupted by
jeers)
All right, all right.. Can I reply?

BOUBACAR
Yep!
19.

FRANCOIS
I'm ready to talk this over, but calmly.
All right, it's true not everyone talks
that way. In fact, people who do are
pretty rare, I'll grant you that. I'd
even say only snobs use the imperfect
subjunctive.

ANGELICA
What's a snob?

FRANCOIS
Snobs are slightly affected, slightly
precious people who tend to put on airs.

He makes an precious gesture with his wrist. A student’s
voice rises up from the back of the class, convinced that
he has found the answer.

BOUBACAR
Homosexuals?

This remark makes Frangois smile.

FRANCOIS
No, not homosexuals. You can be affected
and refined without being homosexual,
Boubacar. In any case, what I see is that
this register may seem formal and a bit
affected and even bourgeois. But the
important fact is these different
registers exist as I keep telling you,
and as I shall carry on telling you, I
think. You need to be able to use them
all: familiar, current, formal, oral and
written Move between them and use them
all. Yes, Lucie?

LUCIE
How do we know what's for written and
what's for oral?

FRANCOIS
Why is a word more for one register than
the other? Normally, that's something
that you pick up as you go along. You
need to use intuition.

DAMIEN
What’s intuition?
20.

FRANCOIS

Intuition is when you can't use thinking.
When you can't really... It's not knowing
but more like sensing something. That's
it. Intuition is when you sense things.

DAMIEN
What if you don't sense them?

FRANCOIS

If you don't sense them, well... You gain
intuition by using the language. That's
when you learn to distinguish almost
automatically between oral and written

styles.
BOUBACAR

Sir, Souleymane wants to say something.
SOULEYMANE

Shut your mouth! Shut it!
FRANCOIS

What does Souleymane want to say?
BOUBACAR

But... please... okay... say it!
FRANCOIS

What is it? What? Calm down!
BOUBACAR

If he says it, you'll tell.
FRANCOIS

Cut it out! No fighting!
SOULEYMANE

I'll whop you!
BOUBACAR

Go ahead, bro, just quit playing the

tough guy!

Frangois is surprised to see Souleymane, who has been
talking with his neighbor for the last few minutes, with
his hand raised.

FRANCOIS
Souleymane, what's wrong?

SOULEYMANE
I’1l whop you one!
21.

FRANCOIS
Boubacar, turn round. Boubacar, turn
round. What is it, Souleymane?

SOULEYMANE
Nothing.

Boubacar, who seems to know what his friend’s question
is, takes over from him.

BOUBACAR
Say it, bro.
FRANCOIS
Apparently something is up.
BOUBACAR
Don't send him to the principal if he
says it.
SOULEYMANE

If I tell you, I'm good for Guantanamo!

Frangois takes an obvious pleasure in pushing Souleymane
who, himself, is having fun upping the stakes.

FRANCOIS
No, no.

STUDENTS
(as one)
Guantanamo, Guantanamo, Guantanamo!

SOULEYMANE

Forget it, I'll be tased.
FRANCOIS

No, you won't be "tased", as you put it.
SOULEYMANE

No, no, no.
FRANCOIS

What is it? You have a question?
SOULEYMANE

Yep.
FRANCOIS

So ask it.
SOULEYMANE

It's too wicked. It's too wicked!
22.

FRANCOIS
No, it’s not too wicked.
SOULEYMANE
But it's the pits for you.
FRANCOIS
Look, now we've come to this, just ask
it!
SOULEYMANE
I have your word?
FRANCOIS
Hurry it up!
SOULEYMANE

I don't know.. This is what I heard, okay?
I didn't say it but I heard... People say
you like men. I didn't say it!

FRANCOIS
Who says that?

SOULEYMANE
Well, just people, see..

FRANCOIS
Really?

SOULEYMANE
They say Mr. Marin likes men and all
that.

Different reactions in the class. We hear laughter and
cries of surprise. Frangois smiles as if he had been
expecting this question sooner or later.

FRANCOIS
Okay. So others say that, not you?
SOULEYMANE
No...
FRANCOIS

No, you’re not interested?
Souleymane squirms on his chair, smiling awkwardly.

SOULEYMANE
No, I don’t give a damn.

FRANCOIS
So why ask the question then?
23.

SOULEYMANE
It’s for the others. I'm a spokesman.
FRANCOIS
But the question doesn’t interest you at
all?
SOULEYMANE
I don't give a damn. If you like men,
fine.
FRANCOIS
Exactly!

Unwilling to back down now that he has come this far and
perhaps basking in the prestige that he is acquiring with
the rest of the class, Souleymane insists:

SOULEYMANE
So is it true or not?

FRANCOIS
So you are asking me!

SOULEYMANE
Homosexual isn't an insult, sir. It isn’t
an insult.

FRANCOIS
You say it isn't but it seems to be a
problem for you. You find it odd, men
liking other men.

SOULEYMANE
Maybe it is, I don't know. But is it true
or not?
FRANCOIS
No, it's not. Feel better now?
SOULEYMANE
Yeah? Sure.
FRANCOIS
Sorry to disappoint you. That’s how it

is.
Souleymane simply pouts dubiously.

ESMERALDA
Wiped him out big time!
24.

FRANCOIS
All right, if Souleymane doesn't mind,
now he's settled his hang-ups, let's get
back to the imperfect indicative.

EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

From a high angle, we see the students horsing around
during the break. Souleymane is taking photos with his
cell phone.

SOULEYMANE
Change the pose, change the pose! Yeah,
like that! Not bad. Go on, move. Hey,
what are you doing?

KHOUMBA
Cut it out, please!

SOULEYMANE
What’s up? Who asked you? Look at your
mug!

KHOUMBA

Hey, give me a break, it’s fucking okay!
Take these jerks, then we'll see.

SOULEYMANE
Go on, show me your backs. Yeah, one
more, go on.

ESMERALDA
Wow, that’s a classy display.

SOULEYMANE
You bet!

KHOUMBA
Got one for me?

SOULEYMANE
You can't afford it.

KHOUMBA
How much is it?

SOULEYMANE
Too much.

KHOUMBA

Stop thinking I'm broke like you.
25.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

Justine comes up to the board, looking a little worried.
Her classmates stare at her as if she were climbing the
gallows. She hesitates for a second but then picks up the
chalk and takes the plunge. She starts declining a verb,
making a mess of it, then hurriedly erases the word that
she has just written. The suspense is perceptible.
Justine ends up turning to Frangois.

ANGELICA
Hold on, that’s not it.

KHOUMBA
She screwed up there. She thinks it's a
regular verb.

ANGELICA

No, the verb's "swim". Swimmed.
FRANCOIS

Quiet!
ANGELICA

I swimmed.
LOUISE

Justine... Swummed!
FRANCOIS

Justine, work it out yourself.
BOUBACAR

Swammed!
KHOUMBA

Swummed. That's better, it mixes the two!
BOUBACAR

It’s swammed, it’s swammed!
ANGELICA

That’s not it!
BOUBACAR

It is!
RACHEL

She put swemmed.

STUDENT
Shut up! Swammed is...
26.

BOUBACAR
Try swommed!
FRANCOIS
All right, thank you, you can sit down.
SOULEYMANE
You big kid! Swommed!
FRANCOIS
Let's see...
RABAH
She can't write!
FRANCOIS
She can't write? Can you, Rabah?
RABAH
You bet!
FRANCOIS

Go on then. Conjugate it properly.
Correct her.

RABAH
First, swimmed.

FRANCOIS
No, carry on. Cut it out, the rest of
you!

RABAH
Swammed.

FRANCOIS
Wrong again.

SOULEYMANE
He sucks.

RABAH

Just kidding. That's not what it is. It's
not like that.

FRANCOIS
So what is it?

RABAH
S.W.. Without an "I".
27.

FRANCOIS
Right, no "I". Why make fun of Justine,
when you can't do any better than she
can?

RABAH
I can.

FRANCOIS
At least Justine got off to a good start...
(to the rest of the class)

That's enough now!

ESMERALDA
What’s up, sir?
FRANCOIS
Can I explain something to you?
RABAH
It’s swammed.
FRANCOIS

What I'm seeing here, is that you can't
focus for more than 20 seconds, like 3-
year-olds. People aged 13, 14 or 15 like
you're supposed to be.. If I ask a
question, they should answer fast and
then we waste no more time.

KHOUMBA
Your kidding around goes too far!

FRANCOIS
Not at all, I don’t think I go too far.

KHOUMBA
Everyone thinks you go too far. Sorry
but...

ESMERALDA
I think so too!

FRANCOIS
Just a second, Khoumba. Everyone thinks
so or only you think so?

ESMERALDA
No, everyone!

FRANCOIS
Speak for yourself for once.
28.

KHOUMBA
Everyone thinks so and I think you push
it too, I mean, what is this?

FRANCOIS
I’m ready to cut you some slack and leave
you right where you are...

ESMERALDA
Teach is spitting hate!

FRANCOIS
«but you'll never get anywhere!

KHOUMBA
That’s no reason to push it too far!
That’s no reason to push it too far!

FRANCOIS
It is. That’s exactly why, the reason I
just gave you.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Vincent bursts into the staff room that is particularly
calm today. He sits down and starts to complain.

VINCENT
I'm sick of these clowns! Sick of them! I
can't take any more! They're nothing,
they know nothing, they look right
through you when you try to teach them.
They can stay in their shit! I'm not
going to help them. They're so basic, so
insincere, always looking for trouble. Go
ahead, guys. Stay in your crap
neighborhood. You'll be here all your
lives and it serves you damn well right!
I'll see the principal and tell him I'm
not working with 3/2 again. No more
technology for the rest of the year. Too
bad. It's been three months now and they
haven't done a single thing! Have you
seen them in the yard? It's like they're
in heat! They're all over each other like
animals. It's crazy! It's the same in
class. Kevin spent a whole hour going...
"duh, duh, duh." I've never seen the like
of it in 5 years. Enough! No more. We're
not animals. Sorry, I'm. It's dumb.

HERVE
Come on. Let's get some air.
29.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

It’s cold outside. The students, in their winter
clothing, seem very excitable. On their desks, we see
“The Diary of Anne Frank”. Some of them read the first
few pages of it amid the general hubbub.

FRANCOIS

One extract isn't a lot to read for
today. No one did it? We're wasting a
crazy amount of time here. Okay, let's
read it or reread it then. Who wants to
read? Great.. Excellent work atmosphere
today! Khoumba, go on.

KHOUMBA
I‘m not reading!
FRANCOIS
What do you mean, you’re not reading?
KHOUMBA
I don’t want to read.
FRANCOIS
So the class revolves around your desires
now?
KHOUMBA

I don't want to read!

FRANCOIS
I don’t care if you don’t want to read!

Khoumba’s sole reply is a sneering sound that immediately
annoys Frangois. He addresses the other twenty-four
students as witnesses.

FRANCOIS
What did Khoumba just do? Wey?
WEY
Sneer.
FRANCOIS
No, I meant her attitude. What did she
show?
They all think hard.
BOUBACAR

Insolence.
30.

FRANCOIS
Yes, that's right, you're an expert.

KHOUMBA
You're standing there, all angrulo with
me! What is this?

FRANCOIS
I'm not, that's not true. And try saying
it in French. What am I?

KHOUMBA
“Angrulo".

FRANCOIS
Say it in everyday French, please.

KHOUMBA
You're wired at me.

FRANCOIS
That's normal French?

KHOUMBA
You've got it in for me!

Frangois is clearly spoiling for a fight and doesn’t want
to leave it at this.

FRANCOIS
Not at all, I just want you to read. And
I think I have the right to ask you to
read, don't I?

KHOUMBA
No.

FRANCOIS
You don't think so?

KHOUMBA
No. No one has read it and you're picking
on me! What is this?

FRANCOIS
Not at all, I’m not picking on you. I
want to work and I've chosen you...

KHOUMBA
Yeah, sure, give me a break.

FRANCOIS
And I have the right to as your French
teacher.
31.

KHOUMBA
Just drop it, I said! Drop it!

FRANCOIS
Shut up now! We’re listening!

KHOUMBA
Yeah, sure! No way, I’m not reading. You
tell me to shut up, then to read. What is
this?

FRANCOIS
What’s what?

KHOUMBA
Make your mind up! Think it through!

Frangois has heard enough.

FRANCOIS
All right, you can come see me after
class and we'll talk it over. It won't be
fun.

KHOUMBA
Yeah, great!

FRANCOIS
You won't say that later. All right,
Esmeralda, are you on strike too or can
you read for us?

ESMERALDA
It's her life. I don’t give a damn.
FRANCOIS
Very good. In that case, will you read
for us?
ESMERALDA

I'd be delighted to!

FRANCOIS
All right, Esmeralda, we're listening.

While Esmeralda reads the extract, the other students
listen more or less attentively. Khoumba, on the other
hand, seems as furious as before.

ESMERALDA
"Dear Kitty, I'm known as a bundle of
contradictions. As I've told you several
times, my soul is split in two.

(MORE)
32.

ESMERALDA (CONT'D)

On one side, my exuberant cheerfulness,
my mocking approach to everything, my joy
in life and my ability to take things
lightly. By that, I mean not seeing any
wrong in flirting, giving a kiss,
embracing someone, or telling a tasteless
joke. That side lies in wait, pushing
back the other side which is more
beautiful, purer and deeper. The truth is
that no one knows Anne's better side and
that's why most people can't stand me. I
can be an amusing clown for an afternoon,
but then everyone has had enough of me.
So the nice Anne has never once been seen
in company. But, in her loneliness, she
always triumphs. My best to you. Anne
Frank. Anne's diary ends here."

FRANCOIS
Anne Frank's diary ends here. Why?
Because the police turned up at the rooms
where Anne Frank's family was hiding and
deported them all. Anne Frank died
shortly after. That's what I asked
earlier and what we've talked about
several times already. When I read this,
I learn about Anne Frank because she
talks about herself and so I get to know
her. When I ask you to write your own
self-portraits, I'll expect the same. In
other words, to learn things through your
feelings. You can also talk about facts
that will allow me to know you better.
Yes, Lucie?

LUCIE
What we write won't be as gripping as... as
what Anne Frank wrote. Our lives aren't
as gripping.

FRANCOIS
All right... Juliette?

JULIETTE
Well, someone aged 70 could talk about
their life, but we have nothing to tell
at 13.

FRANCOIS
I don't know, at 14, 15 or even 13,
you've had experiences.
33.

JULIETTE
Less than a man or a woman aged 70.
They've lived a lot more, they're nearly
through...

STUDENT (0.S.)
They have more to pass on.

FRANCOIS
It's funny. Basically, you don't think
your lives are interesting.

ANGELICA
I don't know, sir. What do we do? We just
come to school, go home, eat and sleep.

FRANCOIS
Really? You come to school, eat, sleep.
Fine. Okay, so the bare facts of your
life are dull. But what you feel,
Angelica, that's what's interesting.

ANGELICA
But that's my business.

FRANCOIS
Yes, maybe, but I'm interested.

ANGELICA
Yes, but you’re different.

FRANCOIS
Why am I different? I perfectly normal.

ANGELICA
Because you're a teacher, that's why.

FRANCOIS
But this isn't the teacher talking.

ESMERALDA
It's your job.

FRANCOIS
You could say it's the human being.

ANGELICA
Okay, but well... I think you're only
saying that to get us to talk and stuff
but it's not true.

FRANCOIS
Really? What isn't true?
34.

ANGELICA
The fact that you're interested in
knowing all that.

FRANCOIS
So you think I'm lying, that I'm not
interested in you at all and that I'm
pushing at this to convince you it's
interesting?

ANGELICA
No, it's not that but it's not as
interesting as you say.

FRANCOIS
Maybe I am exaggerating a little. It's
only natural since you don't agree with
me. But, deep down, I'm totally sincere.
Why is it such a problem for you to talk
about your lives? Boubacar?

BOUBACAR
Well, there's stuff.. There's private
stuff.

FRANCOIS
Yes, of course. What could be hard to say
about your private lives? Burak?

BURAK
Well, we may be ashamed to say certain
things.

FRANCOIS
Yes, it has to do with shame. There are
things you find it hard to say and even
harder to write maybe.

BURAK
Well, yes.

FRANCOIS
And... in your life, your personal life,
when were you ashamed?

BOUBACAR
You can be ashamed of a pal's mom.

FRANCOIS
Ashamed of a pal's mom. Why? Because you
find her ugly?
35.

BOUBACAR
No, it's not that. For instance, Rabah's
mom. She offered me lunch at his place
but I refused because I was ashamed.

FRANCOIS
You were ashamed to eat with Rabah's
mother?

BOUBACAR
Yeah.
FRANCOIS
Because you think she’s unworthy of you?
BOUBACAR
No.
FRANCOIS
I don't understand. Tell me why,
Boubacar.
BOUBACAR

I'm ashamed to eat in front of her
because I respect her.

FRANCOIS
So, you never eat in front of people you
respect?

BOUBACAR
No, it's not that. I mean, she's not my
girlfriend!

FRANCOIS
So you can only eat in front of your
girlfriend? Tell me why, Boubacar. I'm
interested.

BOUBACAR
I can't explain it. In any case, I'm
ashamed... I always hang out with Rabah, so
I respect his mom. I don't eat in front
of her, that's all.

FRANCOIS

So we'll know now that if Boubacar eats
in front of us, it means he doesn't
respect us.

BOUBACAR
No, it's not that! You can't understand.
You can't understand.
36.

FRANCOIS
I can't understand, I'm not smart enough?
BOUBACAR
No, it's not that. You just can't
understand.
FRANCOIS
Rabah.
RABAH

The other week, I was at a party with
nothing but Camemberters.

FRANCOIS
Nothing but Camemberters?

RABAH
Yeah, like you.

FRANCOIS
Remind us what a Camemberter is.

RABAH
Someone who stinks of cheese.

FRANCOIS
So you went to a party where everyone
stank of cheese?

RABAH
They were all in suits and ties. I was in
my baggies and got these weird looks.

FRANCOIS
And you were ashamed?

RABAH
Yeah. Because of the looks.

FRANCOIS
Basically, they were embarrassed in front
of you and so you felt embarrassed in
front of them.

RABAH
No, they weren't embarrassed. They looked
at me like I was an E.T.

FRANCOIS
I see.

BOUBACAR (0.S.)
But you are an E.T.!
37.

RABAH
“Why's that Arab here?"

FRANCOIS
Okay, so it was a race thing or
something...

RABAH
I don't know.. I don't know. But the
snacks were bacon-flavored.

FRANCOIS

So? Is that...
RABAH

So I... abstained.
FRANCOIS

Right. Bacon, ham. Okay, I get it. Wey?
WEY

Young people these days have no shame.
FRANCOIS

Young people now?
WEY

Yes.
FRANCOIS

Like you, for instance?

ESMERALDA
Gimme a break! Drop your briefs!

WEY
You see, they have no shame. It's normal.
Always normal.

FRANCOIS
Are you like them, Wey, or do you feel
shame?

WEY
No, I’m not like them.

FRANCOIS
You feel shame from time to time?

WEY
Yes, shame for them.
38.

ESMERALDA
Shut your mouth! I'll waste your ugly
mug! You should be ashamed, looking the
way you do.

FRANCOIS
Hey! Hey! Anyone can speak but you stay
polite, okay. So, Wey, why are you
ashamed for them?

WEY
They have no shame. They yell, they hit
each other. They make jokes, bother
others. No shame.

FRANCOIS
But, Wey, aren't you confusing shame and
discipline? You find the others rowdy and
impolite?

EVA
It can be shameful, sir.
WEY
Yeah. Yeah, that can be shameful too.
FRANCOIS
All right.
LOUISE

You can be ashamed of your appearance.

FRANCOIS
Absolutely. You can be ashamed of your
appearance. Tell me, Louise, are you ever
ashamed of something physical?

LOUISE
My ears.

FRANCOIS
Your ears?

BOUBACAR (0.S.)
Can we see them?

FRANCOIS
You're ashamed of your ears? What's wrong
with them?

LOUISE
They stick out.
39.

FRANCOIS
You think they stick out. Okay, well, I
think that covers it all. You have all
you need to figure it out. Take out your
exercise books. Note the following
exercise for next Thursday. It's very
simple: "Write your self-portrait."
Remember a self-portrait isn't an
autobiography. I don't want your life
story. Describe yourself and your
personality. We'll read them in class and
see how we can use them. Don't forget.

STUDENT (0.S.)
Goodbye, sir.

FRANCOIS
Goodbye. Hey, just a second, Khoumba! You
know I want to see you. Give me your
report book.

KHOUMBA
Why?

Khoumba tosses the report book at him, which he doesn’t
appreciate.

FRANCOIS
You know why. No, give it to me.
Politely. That's enough now. Put your
photo on it someday. Is it normal to
refuse to read when a teacher asks you
to? Is that normal?

KHOUMBA
There's others in the class!

FRANCOIS
Just because you're not the only one who
screws up doesn't mean I can turn a blind
eye to this. Does it?

KHOUMBA
Okay.

FRANCOIS
What happened this summer? What happened
during the vacation?

KHOUMBA
I didn’t see you during the vacation.
40.

FRANCOIS

Yes, I know you didn't. That's why this
is a problem for me. At the end of the
year in June, we'd gotten on pretty well
together. You participated in class.
Since September, since the start of this
year, you're not cooperative, you keep
sulking, you refuse to read, etc, etc...
What happened?

KHOUMBA
I just don't like reading anymore. Can
you hurry, please?

FRANCOIS
No, I won't hurry! Explain. Why have
things changed all of a sudden?

KHOUMBA
I can't stay a kid forever.

FRANCOIS
So it's a kid thing to cooperate? So
that’s it.

KHOUMBA

I don’t like reading anymore.
FRANCOIS

Sure.
KHOUMBA

There's others in the class.

FRANCOIS
Of course, when you work, it's.. I'll give
it back when I've finished. Okay?

KHOUMBA
But I’m in a hurry, my mom's waiting for
me.

FRANCOIS

Maybe, but I want an apology first. An
apology for what you did. "I apologize
for being insolent, sir."

KHOUMBA
Sorry. Okay?
FRANCOIS
No, not "sorry". "I apologize for being

insolent." Go ahead.
41.

KHOUMBA
I apologize for being insolent, sin...

FRANCOIS
No, "I apologize for being insolent." But
be sincere. I want a real apology.

KHOUMBA
Can you hurry up, please? My mom's
waiting. Maybe you have plenty of time...

FRANCOIS
Your mother can wait. She’s waiting for
you to apologize. This is the ideal
moment. I want a sincere apology that'1l
stand for the rest of the year. We won't
go on like this.

KHOUMBA

I apologize for being insolent to you.
FRANCOIS

More conviction!
KHOUMBA

Hey, come on.. I'm not saying it 50 times!
FRANCOIS

You two! What are you up to?
ESMERALDA

Nothing. We’re waiting.
FRANCOIS

Sure, sure...
KHOUMBA

May I?
FRANCOIS

Hurry, I'm listening!

KHOUMBA
I apologize for being insolent. May I go
now, please? Thank you.

ESMERALDA
You joker!

FRANCOIS
Cut it out!

Khoumba has spoken mechanically, with a total lack of
conviction.
42.

Frangois ends up handing her report book back. She takes
it and skips over to the door. Just as she is about to
vanish off along the corridor, she turns to Frangois and
exclaims.

KHOUMBA
I didn't mean it.
ESMERALDA
You wiped him out big time! Way too

wicked!

Frangois leaps up from his desk but it’s too late. The
girl has already vanished off along the corridor, to the
giggles of her friends. Frangois kicks a chair in
annoyance.

INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

It’s night time. We are in the meeting room. The tables
have been set out in a U-shape. Five or six teachers, a
member of the school’s administration, parents’
representatives, two students (a boy and a girl from year
four) are present.

PRINCIPAL

Two weeks ago, at the last meeting, the
teachers suggested introducing a penalty
point system for the students based on
the driving license system. If students
broke a rule, they would lose points. As
it's the teachers' idea, I'll let them
speak.

STEPHANE

Since last September, we've noticed an
increase in problems within the school.
Punishment has no effect on the students.
So we had the idea of a penalty system.
The students would have, for example, six
points each and, depending on the
misdeed, they'd lose one or two points.

PARENTS’ REP #1
And when they run out of points?

STEPHANE
When they get down to zero, they go
before the disciplinary committee.

PARENTS’ REP #2
As a parents' representative, this is
typical of the school's bad habits.
(MORE)
43.

PARENTS’ REP #2 (CONT'D)
You always condemn the students but never
praise them.

SOPHIE
But they earn praise on their own. They
do it with their grades, by moving up a
class and we do it in staff meetings by
encouraging them to work if their grades
are below average. Then there's the honor
roll, the congratulations... That all
counts!

BURAK’S MOTHER
In your system, you take away points for
misdeeds but why not go further and give
points to those who do good things?

SOPHIE
Like gold stars!

JULIE
I'm all for praising the students but if
students collect points and end up with
34 points, say, that leaves room for all
kinds of trouble we can't control.

FREDERIC
Without going as far as these imaginary
34 points, six points to start with means
they can cause trouble without
punishment. I'm sorry, but losing a point
or two isn't a real punishment. It can
create a dangerous sense of impunity. For
me, the idea's totally wrong-headed.

PRINCIPAL
In that case, we could find a punishment
where the students lose all their points
in one go. But why bother with the points
in that case?

SOPHIE
That’s the whole problem.

PRINCIPAL
It’s not simple.

FRANCOIS
You know, what you call a sense of
impunity gives us room to maneuver. When
you're dealing with punishments that are
cut and dried, you can't adapt them to
each case.
44,

FREDERIC
No, I don't agree. The rules apply in the
same way to all the students. They break
them, they're punished. If not, why
bother with rules?

FRANCOIS
Maybe, but dealing with extremely strict
rules creates the greatest tension. Take
cell phones, for instance. We agreed on a
rule that cell phones were not allowed in
class. Well, sorry, but I break that rule
because I realized it wasn't a problem
for me. There's room to maneuver, to be
tolerant.

FREDERIC
Sure, that's the reign of the arbitrary.

FARIDA
No, the law and the spirit of the law.

PRINCIPAL
Now then, I know we could talk all night
but that's not possible. We have other
topics to tackle. In particular, one
vital issue, a very sensitive one,
concerning the coffee machine that the
teachers have asked to talk about.

SOPHIE
It's a sensitive issue, all right!
Everyone agrees there's a real problem
with the coffee machine this year. The
price of a coffee has gone up from 40
centimes to 50 centimes. That may seem
petty but since we drink several coffees
a day at 8, at 10 or at 4 in the
afternoon, it works out at a lot. So
we've clubbed together to buy a coffee
maker. That way, we can drink as much
coffee as we want without having to

count.

PRINCIPAL
Monsieur Pierre will be delighted to
reply.

Monsieur Pierre, the bursar, starts speaking shyly. All
the same, we can tell that nothing will stop him.
45.

MONSIEUR PIERRE
Yes. First of all, I'd like to remind you
that this machine was installed in 2001
to replace a machine that needed the
intervention of an outside company for
restocking, repairs, etc. It was very
expensive and not at all profitable. We
switched to the new machine which isn't
profitable yet.

SOPHIE
I'm sorry to hear that!

Used to the bursar’s endless speeches, the people present
exchange embarrassed looks that Monsieur Pierre, his eyes
glued to his notes, haughtily ignores.

MONSIEUR PIERRE
And so we increased the price of coffee
by ten centimes to fifty centimes. There.
The thing has to be economically viable.

SOPHIE
Isn't anyone shocked by this?

PRINCIPAL
It's clear and logical to me.

INT. MEETING ROOM & CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Gathered around a meager buffet, all the people attending
the meeting sip champagne. Frangois quickly slips out to
smoke a cigarette in the yard.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We find Frangois alone, walking down a long, dark
corridor as the sounds of the small party fade.

INT. STAFF ROOM - NIGHT

He pushes open the door of the staff room. Two CLEANING
WOMEN who were chatting peacefully pick up their gear and
apologize. Frangois tells them that they can stay, but
the two women have already slipped out into the corridor.
Frangois opens his locker and pulls out a pile of papers
on which the mandarin orange is balanced. Frangois puts
the fruit back in the depths of the locker and
automatically sniffs the first sheet before reading it.
It’s the work that he gave Khoumba as punishment.
46.

We can just make out the title, written in block
capitals: “RESPECT”.

KHOUMBA (V.O.)
"Respect." #Adolescents learn to respect
their teachers little by little because
of their threats or the fear of having
problems. For starters, I respect you and
respect must be mutual. For instance, I
don't say you're hysterical, so why do
you say I am? I've always respected you
so I don't understand why I have to write
this. In any case, I know you have it in
for me but I don't know why. I have
decided to sit at the back of the class
from now on to avoid any other conflicts,
unless you come looking for them. I admit
I can be insolent, but only if I'm
provoked. I won't look at you again, so
you can't say my look is insolent. In
theory, in a French class, you talk about
French, not your grandma, your sister or
girls' periods. And so, from now on, I
won't speak to you again. Signed Khoumba.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

Khoumba’s voice continues over this next scene. While
Frangois is at his desk, the students work on their self-
portraits with more or less care. Some have “The Diary of
Anne Frank” open on their desks. Others daydream or chat
in low voices. On the blackboard, we can read, “I work on
my self-portrait”. Frangois goes from table to table,
advising the different students.

FRANCOIS
Why are you hiding it like that? What's
wrong?

RABAH

It's a secret.

FRANCOIS
A secret? It won't stay a secret for
long. Esmeralda, why have you changed
places?

ESMERALDA
No reason, I just wanted to.

FRANCOIS
Is there a problem?
47.

ESMERALDA
No, not at all. No problem. I just wanted
a change of scene.

He turns to Khoumba who immediately looks away.

FRANCOIS
Okay, that's enough. Let's get to work.

BOUBACAR
No, sir, please! Please, sir!

FRANCOIS
You're just copying what you did at home.
You've had plenty of time.

BOUBACAR
That's right, that’s right but, sir, we
have to do it neatly here. Please!

FRANCOIS
Esmeralda, we're listening.

ESMERALDA
Huh? I have to?

FRANCOIS
Yes, absolutely.

ESMERALDA
My name is Esmeralda Ouertani, I'm 14 and
I live at 9, Allée du Pére Julien Dhuit,
Paris 20, with my two parents and my
three brothers and sisters. Later, I'd
like to be a policewoman because people
say all policemen are bad and so we need
good ones. If not, I'd like to be a
rapper and I'ma fan of Bakar, Médine,
Younes, Marvin and Mafiak'l Fry.
Otherwise, I like eating, sleeping and
hanging out in the ‘hood.

FRANCOIS
Yes, or rather?

ESMERALDA
The neighborhood.

FRANCOIS
Yes, so why don't you change it since you
know how? When you write, you use the
standard style. Don't wait until I
correct you. Wey, go on.
48.

WEY
All right. My name's Wey, I'm Chinese,
I'm 15, I have two sisters, I'm the
youngest. My hobby is playing video
games, at least 4 hours a day. I find it
hard using French correctly. It's so hard
expressing myself that others don't
understand me. That's why I don't
communicate much. I hardly ever go out.
Nothing much interests me outside. The
environment doesn't suit me here since
I'm allergic but I don't know what.

ESMERALDA
Allergic to yourself, that's why they
can't find what you're allergic to!

FRANCOIS

That's good, Wey. I feel that I know you
better after hearing your self-portrait.
That's the goal. To tell us things.

RABAH (0.S.)

It just happens to be good when it’s him.
FRANCOIS

What?
RABAH

His just happens to be good, not ours.
Ours never are.

FRANCOIS

No, not at all. If Wey's work is good, I
congratulate him. And I'll gladly
congratulate you if you've managed to do
it well. That's the truth... In fact,
Rabah, you can read us your self-
portrait.

RABAH
No, I’m not reading.

FRANCOIS
So how can I congratulate you if you
don't?

RABAH
I don't need that.

FRANCOIS
Well make your mind up!
49.

BOUBACAR (0.S.)
You want compliments.

FRANCOIS
Go on, we're listening.

RABAH
My name's Rabah, I'm 14, I listen to rap.
I love my village in Kabylia and go there
every year. I like music, rap and slam. I
have two brothers but I don't like
school. I don't like tramps. I like
Zidane, I like to talk and I like Psy 4
de la Rime's videos. Go Marseille!

FRANCOIS
We can manage without Marseille.

ESMERALDA (0.S.)
Go Paris, you mean!

FRANCOIS
We don't really need it in a self-
portrait.

CHERIF

Sir, he didn't read it all! He skipped
two lines!

RABAH
That's all! I read the lot!
FRANCOIS
Hey, cut it out!
RABAH
Go, dude!
FRANCOIS
Boubacar!
BOUBACAR

"I like to make love".

RABAH
I never wrote that!

BOUBACAR
"I like to look good for the women and I
like summer to see girls' cleavage."
50.

FRANCOIS
Okay, all right.
(reactions from the other
students)
Why not, Rabah, why not?

RABAH
I never wrote that! I won't say who did.
FRANCOIS
It looks a lot like your writing though.
RABAH
My writing? No way.
FRANCOIS
It does. But there's no shame in liking
cleavage.
RABAH

Is this my writing?

Frangois looks around the class. His gaze settles on
Souleymane.

FRANCOIS
It's not a sin. Souleymane, stop rocking
and read your self-portrait. I'm curious
to hear it.

The adolescent, sprawled on his chair, sits up straight,
taking his time.

SOULEYMANE
Huh?
FRANCOIS
No, not huh.
SOULEYMANE
I didn't write anything, sir.
FRANCOIS
But I’m sure you did, I saw you writing
earlier.
SOULEYMANE
No, I wrote nothing.
FRANCOIS
You did.
SOULEYMANE

Nothing!
51.

FRANCOIS
We're listening.

SOULEYMANE
I'm Souleymane. I have nothing to say
about me because no one knows me but me.

After a moment’s silence, Frangois says ironically.

FRANCOIS
(calming the jeers of the
other students)
Okay, okay, enough.. That's good. A bit
long maybe. How come you can't make the
effort that the others did?

SOULEYMANE
I don't like talking about myself, that's
all.

FRANCOIS

How come the others make the effort and
you don't?

SOULEYMANE
Well, if they do, that's their problem. I
don't talk about my life, okay.

FRANCOIS
Really?

This leads to a little laughter. Esmeralda can’t stop
herself from making fun of Souleymane.

ESMERALDA
It's not that he doesn't want to, he just
can't write, that's all!

SOULEYMANE
What's up, you cop? You want to be a cop
and you're talking to me? Goddam cop!

ESMERALDA
I can live with it.

FRANCOIS
All right, that’s enough!

SOULEYMANE
Get lost, cop. Arrest guys instead of
talking to me. Got your cuffs?

ESMERALDA
Chill, French guy.
52.

SOULEYMANE
Your breath stinks!

ESMERALDA
Chill, okay.

SOULEYMANE

Heard of Aquafresh?

FRANCOIS
Souleymane, Souleymane, there's no need
to be offensive.

SOULEYMANE
I can lend you a toothbrush if you want!

FRANCOIS

Okay, cut it out. Souleymane, you're a
lot better at oral insults, you're great
at that, but when it comes to writing,
nobody's home.

ESMERALDA
He can't even write his name.

Souleymane’s sole reply is to point to a tattoo in Arabic
that he has on his neck.

SOULEYMANE
Zip it! What does this say?
ESMERALDA
Go on then, the same old shit with your

Koran.
Souleymane becomes indignant.
SOULEYMANE

Shut your mouth. What's wrong with the
Koran? I'll spare you my "shit" when you

calm down!

ESMERALDA
Go on, piss us off, that’s from the
Koran?

FRANCOIS

Hey, calm down.

SOULEYMANE
It’s the Koran so shut your mouth!

ESMERALDA
Stop making this crap up!
53.

SOULEYMANE
I’m not making it up!

Frangois comes over and tries to see the tatoo.

FRANCOIS
What's that tattoo, Souleymane? Why are
you showing it to us?

ESMERALDA
He says it's from the Koran but that’s
not for sure!

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth!

FRANCOIS
Hey, hey! What is it? What is that
tattoo? Why are you showing it to us?

SOULEYMANE
It's nothing, it’s nothing!

Boubacar comes to his rescue.

BOUBACAR
It means shut your mouth, shut your
mouth!

SOULEYMANE
You shut your mouth! That’s not what it
means!

FRANCOIS
So give us the right translation. Go on,
tell us.

SOULEYMANE

I don't want to tell you.

FRANCOIS
You show it in my class so you're going
to tell us what it means.

Souleymane hesitates for a second.

SOULEYMANE
It says here, right here: "If your words
are less important than silence, keep
quiet."

BOUBACAR
That’s what I said!
54.

SOULEYMANE
No, that’s not what you said.
BOUBACAR
Hey, Rabah, isn’t that what I said?
SOULEYMANE
No, it’s not what you said.
FRANCOIS
Why isn't it the same thing that Boubacar
said?
SOULEYMANE

I don't know. It's different. I think it
sounds better.

FRANCOIS
Yes, it's better put. Souleymane, if only
you could write as interesting things on
paper as on your arm, that would be
great.

SOULEYMANE
Yeah, yeah, I think so too.

FRANCOIS
That proves you can do it. Right, after
these first few self-portraits, I'd like
you to rewrite them and polish them,
making sure you answer the questions that
we listed at the start of class: what I
like and don't like, my qualities and
flaws, who I'd like to be..

(a knock on the door)
Come in!

PRINCIPAL
Good morning.

FRANCOIS
Good morning.

The principal has come to introduce a new student, CARL,
to the class. On seeing that the students aren’t going to
move, the principal sets them straight. They stand
reluctantly.

PRINCIPAL
Stand up, please. Good morning. That goes
for those at the back too. Come on, stand
up. Chérif, did you hear me? Everyone has
to stand. It's simply a way of greeting
an adult.

(MORE)
55.

PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
It doesn't mean submission or
humiliation. All right. Sit back down.
I've come to introduce a new student.
Carl. Try to make him welcome until the
end of the year. Thank you. Goodbye.

Frangois gestures to the classroom. As the principal goes
back out, the new students sluggishly takes his place as
the other students look on, intrigued.

FRANCOIS
Thank you. Goodbye. Carl, go sit in the
third row, in that free place. Khoumba,
can you move your things? Take a sheet of
paper and a pen and try to catch up with
the others. We'll talk after.

(the bell rings)
Don't forget the homework for Monday
without fail. Let's finish with this.
Goodbye. Carl, stay here a minute or two.

STUDENTS
Goodbye. Adios, sefior.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

As the other students leave the classroom, Frangois
signals to Carl to wait. The boy looks a little worried.

FRANCOIS
Welcome.

CARL
Thank you.

Now that the other students have left, Frangois adopts a
more confidential tone.

FRANCOIS
I don't know if you know but I'm Mr.
Marin, your French teacher and your class
supervisor. So if there's a problem, you
talk to me about it. I know who you are.
I mean, I know why you're here. The
principal told me but that doesn't
matter. We'll start from scratch here,
okay? It will all go well. You've seen
that we.. We're on self-portraits to be
handed in next Monday. Maybe you could do
one too. You know when the next class is?

Carl looks awkward.
56.

CARL
Monday, at 9.30.

FRANCOIS
Yes, Monday, at 9.30, very good. All
right.. And do you like French?

CARL
Yes, like everyone, I guess.
FRANCOIS
That doesn't mean much. Okay, off you go.
CARL
Goodbye.
FRANCOIS

Goodbye. You know what a self-portrait
is, that’s not a problem?

CARL
Yes.

FRANCOIS
You're sure?

CARL

Yes, have a good day.

INT. CLASS - NIGHT

One evening after the day’s classes, Frangois, sitting at
his desk, sees the students’ parents one by one.

We see a series of portraits of the students’ parents.
Some defend their offspring tooth and nail, others demand
greater severity with their children and others still
seem totally indifferent to what Frangois has to say.

WEY’S PARENTS seem to be concentrating hard and hanging
on Frangois’ every word but the looks on their faces show
that they don’t understand.

FRANCOIS
Good evening. Pleased to meet you.

WEY’S FATHER
Good evening.

FRANCOIS

Sit down, please. Thank you for coming. I

know it isn't easy. Well, we're very

pleased with Wey. Very pleased indeed.
(MORE)
57.

FRANgGOIS (CONT'D)
All the teachers at the staff meeting
said so. He's kind, he's pleasant... It's
good to have him in class. And it's
showing in his grades. We have.. the usual
good grades in mathematics. He's doing
well there. 13/20. In French, we have a 9
here...

WEY’S FATHER
Not a lot.

Meanwhile, Wey’s mother looks on, a big smile on her
face. She clearly doesn’t understand what is being said
but has a vague impression that Frangois is speaking
favorably about her son.

FRANCOIS
Well, he doesn't speak French very well
yet but that's only normal. He talks a
lot. He tells me about a lot of things.
He talks about his computer. He's into
that.

WEY’S FATHER
Yes, yes, always too late.

FRANCOIS
You think he works too late?

WEY’S FATHER
Yes, too late, not sleep good. After,
school not good. Eyes get sick after.

FRANCOIS
Yes, his eyes.. In any case, he may spend
a lot of time on the computer but things
are fine at school for now.

WEY’S FATHER
Yes, thank you.

FRANCOIS
He works well and he doesn't seem tired.

WEY’S FATHER
Thank you.

Nassim comes next, with his FATHER

NASSIM'S FATHER
Nassim.. I'd like him to do.. He can go
far. He has all he needs. At his age, I
wasn't that lucky. I'm right behind him.
Anything he needs, I get him, no problem.
(MORE)
58.

NASSIM’S FATHER (CONT'D)
But he has to do right. It's true, things
are good at home with him but I'd like
him to keep on studying.. and go far. Me
and his mother, we'd like to be proud of
him. That's what we ask of him.

FRANCOIS
I think we all agree on what we need to
do. It's crazy how alike you are.

NASSIM
We're lookers in the family, only
natural.

FRANCOIS

Yes, you're right.
The next parent is ARTHUR’S MOTHER.

ARTHUR'S MOTHER
So an adolescent who talks with his
family, who has good grades, who has
friends, even if he's a bit of a loner,
he's an outcast? He's a boy who talks
with adults, who exchanges with them.
Maybe he doesn't with you but that means
he's just a teenager trying to define
himself, that's all. I was useless at
school for years. I rejected the idea of
making us fit in with the system. Do his
black clothes bother you? The way he
looks? I don't get it.

Then comes Burak’s mother (seen at a meeting earlier),
with her son.

BURAK’S MOTHER
I'd like him to go to the best, to Henri

Iv.

FRANCOIS
Henri IV? Why do you want him to go
there?

BURAK’S MOTHER
Because...

BURAK
Standards again.. Henri IV is all she
thinks about.

BURAK’S MOTHER
Because they have very high standards. A
mother always wants the best for her son.
59.

BURAK
Yeah, my mother's scared I'll feel lost
in high school because the others went to
fancy private schools and Dolto High
isn't as demanding so...

BURAK’S MOTHER
It's a pity that the teachers, well,
maybe not the teachers, I don't want to
accuse anyone... but the school...

FRANCOIS
Go on, accuse us. It's always a pleasure.

BURAK’S MOTHER
Why don't you try to push the better
students a little harder, say? They get
bogged down by other students who aren't
as good.

BURAK
My mom makes stuff up. Dolto High isn't
useless. She thinks private schools...

BURAK’S MOTHER
I didn't say useless, I said average. I
didn't call it useless.

This stream of parents ends with Souleymane’s mother,
accompanied by her older son, aged 17 or so. He is the
one who speaks since his mother doesn’t understand a word
of French.

FRANCOIS

We talked about Souleymane a great deal

at the staff meeting. Many teachers have
complained about his attitude, which is

very negative.

Souleymane’s brother immediately becomes heated.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Oh yeah?

FRANCOIS

Many complain that he comes without his
things. When he comes, that is, as he's
often absent. He's often late too.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Oh yeah?

FRANCOIS
In any case, I think you know that.
60.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
No, we didn't know. Souleymane tells us
he works hard.

A brief conversation with his mother in Malian.
Souleymane’s brother becomes annoyed as he translates for
his mother who also starts to get angry.

FRANCOIS
Can you translate for me?

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She.. she doesn’t believe it.

FRANCOIS
There have been notes in his report book
since September, three months now. Notes
about the problems he was having.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She signs them without knowing because
she can't read, see.

FRANCOIS
What about you? Do you read the notes
too?

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes, but I'm just his brother. You see?

FRANCOIS
Okay, but you knew there was a problem?

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
No, I didn't know. Whenever I ask, he
says things are fine.

FRANCOIS
Do you see him work at home?

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
He stays in his room Sso..

FRANCOIS
I see.

Another conversation in Malian. Souleymane’s mother, as
angry as before, starts talking curtly to her son.
Frangois looks at them in surprise.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She says she doesn't understand the notes
in the report book.
61.

FRANCOIS
Yes, I realize that. In any case, you
know the situation now. I'm telling you
officially: there's a problem. You need
to talk to him.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes, I'll talk to him about it, I'll talk
to him about it.

FRANCOIS
Well, just having a.. Maybe a conversation
with his father could help too.. it would
be interesting.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes, yes, I'll see, I'll talk to my
father and see what we can do tonight.

FRANCOIS
Okay, we're not settling scores. We just
want to improve things.

He stands to say goodbye, shaking hands with Souleymane’s
mother, then with his brother.

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Goodbye.

FRANCOIS
Goodbye.

Another conversation in Malian. Souleymane’s mother has
already turned to leave.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The students wait in the corridor outside the computer
room. Souleymane is showing the others some photos on his
cell phone. We see views of his apartment and of him
clowning around with his friends. His classmates are
impressed by the quality of the photos but start laughing
when they see a photo of Souleymane’s mother,
particularly tense and glum in front of the camera.

BOUBACAR
Is that your mom?

SOULEYMANE
You bet.

STUDENT

Shit, she’s an ugly old crow!
62.

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth, your ma's ugly, and so
are you.

BOUBACAR

She sulking or what?

SOULEYMANE
No, she just hates photos. Me and my bro
had pissed her off.

Frangois comes up discreetly behind them and listens in
on the conversation.

FRANCOIS
Let's get started.

Boubacar, who has noticed Frangois, calls out to him.
BOUBACAR
Hey, sir, look, Souleymane has brought
photos for his portrait.

A little embarrassed, Souleymane looks away.

SOULEYMANE
Cut it out, my photos are crap, they
suck.

FRANCOIS

That's good! It's a great idea.

SOULEYMANE
Get lost you! Get your own cell!

Frangois opens the door and the students rush over to the
computers.

FRANCOIS
Painters do self-portraits. Photographers
too.

SOULEYMANE

Yes, but too bad, I'm no painter.

FRANCOIS
I know that. All right, let’s get
started. Caps off, please. Hello...

EVA
I spend all my free time playing the
guitar.
63.

They are all busy typing up their self-portraits.
Souleymane has taken out a cable and, crouching under the
table, is looking for a free USB connector. Frangois is a
little worried

FRANCOIS
If you're typing, hurry and finish to let
the others type up their self-portraits.
Souleymane, don't blow the place up!

SOULEYMANE
No, no, not right away.
FRANCOIS
You know what you’re doing?
SOULEYMANE
Yeah, yeah.
FRANCOIS

Well, since you're a computer genius, you
can put it all back after.

SOULEYMANE
Don't worry.
FRANCOIS
I'm counting on you. Everything okay,
Carl?
CARL
Yes, sir.

In another corner of the room, Carl is typing something
up. He doesn’t pay any attention to his classmates who
treat him just as indifferently. Frangois comes up behind
him and tries to read over his shoulder. Carl immediately
turns his screen away.

FRANCOIS
I’m not allowed to see it?
CARL
No, not yet.
ESMERALDA
Sir?
FRANCOIS
Yes.
ESMERALDA

How do you spell Lafayette?
64.

FRANCOIS
How do you mean?

ESMERALDA
Like Galeries Lafayette.

FRANCOIS
Why are you mentioning that?

ESMERALDA
I go there often so I want to add it.

FRANCOIS
That's weird. I mean, it's four metro
stops from here. You never usually leave
the neighborhood, that's a huge leap in
one go.

Khoumba gets annoyed.

KHOUMBA
Hey, we're not hicks!
ESMERALDA
We're city kids!
FRANCOIS
Really? You go into the center of Paris?
ESMERALDA
You bet!
KHOUMBA

I go everywhere. The lst, the 5th, the
20th, the 12th, the 19th...

FRANCOIS
Really? Why do you go to the 5th?

KHOUMBA
In the 5th, I go to see pals in high
school. Near Luxembourg.

FRANCOIS
I see. You go to the Luxembourg Gardens?

KHOUMBA
No, not the gardens, I said Luxembourg.

FRANCOIS
You go to the country called Luxembourg?

KHOUMBA
No, the Luxembourg metro station!
65.

Frangois tries to changed the subject.

FRANCOIS

All right. So you do get out and about.
(a beat)

I see you two have made up. That’s good.

KHOUMBA
That's our business.
ESMERALDA
And not yours.
KHOUMBA
So, how do you spell Lafayette?
FRANCOIS
Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E. With a

capital.

All of a sudden, things start stirring in Souleymane’s
corner. Souleymane has uploaded his photos and more or
less added them to his layout.

BOUBACAR

Yeah, they're much better now!
SOULEYMANE

Much better.
BOUBACAR

She looks good.
Frangois comes over and looks at the screen.

FRANCOIS
Yes, that is a good photo.

Souleymane turns to the screen as if to check on what
Frangois is saying.

SOULEYMANE
Yeah.

FRANCOIS
And now you could add a legend.

SOULEYMANE
A legend? Meaning?

BOUBACAR
Like a story or a tale.
66.

FRANCOIS
No, not that kind of legend. A caption
under the photo like in newspapers.

SOULEYMANE

You mean, like in "Le Parisien"?
FRANCOIS

Yes, like in "Le Parisien".
SOULEYMANE

Oh, right.
FRANCOIS

What kind of legend could you put here?
Who is this woman?

SOULEYMANE
My old woman.

FRANCOIS
Meaning?

SOULEYMANE
My mother.

FRANCOIS

Well, you could say she's your mother.
Then you could explain why she's making
this gesture of pushing away the
photographer.

BOUBACAR
Him and his brother had just pissed her
off.

SOULEYMANE
I'm not gonna write that!

FRANCOIS
So why is she making that gesture?

SOULEYMANE
She hates photos.

FRANCOIS
So write that. "My mother hates having
her photo taken." That's a legend, see?

SOULEYMANE
Yeah, yeah.
67.

FRANCOIS
Then do that with all the photos and
you're set.

SOULEYMANE
Yeah...

FRANCOIS
Printed it all out?

SOULEYMANE
Yeah, yeah, I’m all set.

FRANCOIS
Great. This is perfect.

Souleymane’s photos emerge from the printer, perfectly
laid out and captioned. Frangois goes to pin them to the
wall as Souleymane watches, suddenly intimidated.

SOULEYMANE
What are you doing now, sir?

FRANCOIS

As you can see, I'm putting the photos up
to get a global view. The others read out
their self-portraits, so you're going to
put yours on show.

Souleymane looks more like an intimidated child than
ever.

SOULEYMANE

My photos suck, you know that.
FRANCOIS

Not at all, they're very good.
SOULEYMANE

Sure...
FRANCOIS

And when a student does good work, I let
the whole class see it.

SOULEYMANE
You're just doing this to wind me up.

FRANCOIS
No, I wind you up if I feel you can do
better. This is good.

SOULEYMANE
That's bullshit.
68.

FRANCOIS

If you've finished, come and take a look
at Souleymane's masterpiece. Slowly.
We'll straighten them after.

Souleymane, surprised at seeing his “work” on show like
this, has the impression that he is naked in front of the
whole class. The other students come over (only Carl
continues to work on his text). They all make
enthusiastic comments that Souleymane responds to with a
great deal of false modesty. We can tell that he is both
flattered and worried about revealing so much. As we hear
the students’ comments, the camera shows us Souleymane’s
photos in close-up: the members of his family, views of
his neighborhood... he has often photographed himself too,
occasionally in everyday situations, but also at times
from a more narcissistic angle with close-ups on his
tattoos.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

CARL
I like playing soccer. I like playing
computer games. I like playing with
pretty girls. I like vacations in the
Caribbean. I like fries, zouk and
dancehall music. I like watching MTV Base
and I like my parents and my brother. I
like my pals and staying up all night. I
like the TV series on the slave trade. I
like my 'hood. I like the series
"Homeland Security". I like eating in
restaurants and going wild. I hate people
crying for no reason. I hate techno and
tectonic. I hate guys and girls who show
off. I hate visiting my brother in jail.
I hate talent contest shows on TV. I hate
politicians, the war in Irag, Goths and
skaters. I hate teachers who are too
strict. I hate mathematics, racists and I
hate Materazzi. I hated the Paul Eluard
school and I like being here.

The class is perplexed by this whole declaration.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the staff room, Sophie discreetly takes a bottle of
champagne out of her bag and pops it into the small
fridge under the coffee machine. Behind her, the
conversations are interrupted by the arrival of Julie,
the year supervisor, who addresses the whole staff.
69.

JULIE
Hello, I have something to say. Could you
listen to me, please? Rachel, I have
something to say. The mother of Wey, a
student in 4/3, has been arrested. She
was in France illegally. She has been
picked up, she's in a holding center and
may be tried next week. She could be
deported back to China. I thought you
should know as it's important.

CECILE
That's crazy, the family's been here 3
years now!

JULIE
Yes, I know but that's how it goes, wrong
place, wrong time. The police turn up and
she gets taken in.

FREDERIC
What about the father?

JULIE
The father doesn't have papers either but
they're not bothering him for some
reason. So, what I wanted to suggest, to
start with, as lawyers cost a lot, we
could do a collection and maybe even go
to court to try to have some influence on
the verdict.

Julie puts an envelope down on the main table so that
everyone can add his or her contribution. Sophie,
standing near the fridge, looks awkward.

FRANCOIS
Will Wey have to leave too?

JULIE
Not for now but you never know.

A moment’s silence. Sophie decides to take the plunge.
She takes the bottle out of the fridge.

SOPHIE
Well, I feel kind of pathetic after that.
I had something to tell you, but this
isn't a good time.

ANNE
You've said too much now!
70.

SOPHIE
I'm pregnant.

VINCENT
Yeah! That calls for a celebration!

FREDERIC
Congratulations!

The news is greeted with enthusiastic exclamations.
Someone takes the bottle from Sophie, someone else hands
out plastic cups, while Sophie, clearly touched by their
reaction, sits down as if she were about to give birth.
Rachel hands her a glass of champagne.

RACHEL
How far gone?
SOPHIE
Two months. I'll only have a drop. Just a

drop.
Vincent opens the bottle messily.

TEACHER (0.S.)
Bravo, Vincent!

SOPHIE
He's an expert!
VINCENT
I didn't do it on purpose! Who shook the
bottle?
ANNE
Here, Sophie.
SOPHIE
Thank you.
FRANCOIS
Any ideas about names yet? If it's a boy,
say?
SOPHIE
If it's a boy, I’d like to call him
Enguerran.
VINCENT
Enguerran?
SOPHIE

Yes.
71.

TEACHER (0.S.)
Seriously?

FRANCOIS
It's good to give him a handicap in life.
I mean, he'll have plenty of other

advantages...

SOPHIE
Thanks a lot! I hope not. You all have a
glass?

VINCENT

Just a second...

TEACHERS
Cheers!

They all raise their glasses. In the midst of this
agitation, Sophie looks absent for a second. Then she too
raises her glass to make a toast.

SOPHIE
Right, I have two wishes. I have two
wishes. My first wish is that Wey's mom
can stay in France. And my second wish is
that my child will be as intelligent as
Wey. Cheers, everybody.

EXT. YARD - DAY

We see a soccer match in the schoolyard. Carl seems to
have found his place among his classmates. In fact, he is
very sure of himself as he plays, monopolizing the ball
with a great deal of ease.

Souleymane tackles him and make him fall.

SOULEYMANE
(to Wey)
Jackie Chan! Go for it!
(turning to look at Carl)
I didn't do nothing! I didn't do nothing!
He just fell! He came at me, I never
touched him.

PLAYERS (0.S.)
Hand! Hand! Thanks! Play, Souleymane!

SOULEYMANE
Fucking go for it!
72.

A few minutes later, Carl dodges a tackle by Souleymane
and scores.

CARL
What do you say now, Mali man?

SOULEYMANE
What's up, you Caribbean shit?
Motherfucker! Let go of me, I'll waste
the fucker! Caribbean fag! Let go of me!
Shut your mouth! Go blow Thierry Henri,
faggot!

INT. CLASS —- DAY

As the class settles down, Frangois explains the rules of
the game to them.

Nassim is
impatient
a hint of

FRANCOIS
Stand there. Talk loud enough for them to
hear and try to convince them. Go ahead.

the first to react. He seems genuinely
to express himself. He harangues the class with
provocation in his voice directed at

Souleymane.

NASSIM
The Africa Cup of Nations will be
starting soon. I'm glad Morocco's
playing. It's the best team in the world
in my opinion. The sick thing is that my
pals, the Malians, aren't playing. It's
tough for them. They weren't good enough
to qualify. Morocco would have let them
play on a friendly basis but 4-0 really
hurts.

As he speaks, Souleymane simply nods his head, as if to
say, “Go right ahead...”

FRANCOIS
What do you mean 4-0?

NASSIM
Last time Mali played Morocco, they
wasted them 4-0. But the weird thing is
when Mali doesn't play, it's like all the
Africans here aren't African. With each
cup, they all go crazy but when Mali
doesn't play, they keep a low profile.
Weird.
73.

FRANCOIS
So, whether Mali plays in the Africa Cup
of Nations or not, the Africans in this
class feel more or less African. Okay.
Thank you, Nassim. I get the feeling your
words are directed at your neighbor,
Souleymane.

SOULEYMANE
Morocco jerk's not even on my radar.

FRANCOIS
Arthur is next. I see you have your
notes, just like a politician.

ARTHUR
Exactly.

FRANCOIS
Well, that’s good. Speak up, Arthur.

ESMERALDA
You want a slap?

FRANCOIS
Esmeralda, let him speak before you judge
him.

ARTHUR
I want to defend the way I look because a
lot of people say it sucks.

STUDENT (0.S.)
Right on, dude!

ARTHUR
I don't dis your clothes, so you don't
dis mine. Clothes are freedom of speech.
I dress how I want, you dress how you
want, I say nothing to you, you say
nothing to me. I dress like this to be
different and not follow the others like
sheep.

STUDENT (0.S.)
You're the sheep here!

ARTHUR
I feel better being myself and not being
like others. I also think if there were
22 Goths in this class and one guy like
you, you'd keep quiet then.
74.

FRANCOIS
Arthur, I think there's a contradiction
in what you say. You want to be you. But
are those clothes you? Those clothes are
worn by a huge number of people.

ARTHUR
Most people who wear them are gloomy
inside so we're all kind of alike.

FRANCOIS
You're all alike, you're all gloomy, so
that's not you.

ARTHUR
No, by being different.

FRANCOIS
You're different and the same. Thank you
for taking a stand and being brave enough
to do so.

(a beat)
Boubacar, go on.

ESMERALDA
Boubacar, my pal!

FRANCOIS
Quiet. Listen to him.

BOUBACAR
I've come up to reply to Nassim. He says
that since Mali isn't in the Africa Cup
of Nations, black Africans have no team
to support. But he's forgetting one
country, Ivory Coast. With an ace player,
Didier Drogba. Yeah, Didier Drogba.
Didier Drogba beats any Moroccan. He
plays for Chelsea. What Moroccan plays in
England? They're not up to it. I'm
through.

FRANCOIS
Thanks, Boubacar. I think that
rectification was indeed... indispensable.
Who wants to speak now? Carl, go on.

CARL
Actually, I'd like to say they're
starting to piss us off with this Africa
Cup. At break you're there, pissing us
off with your cup. It hasn't even started
yet...
75.

BOUBACAR
Carl, I'll be polite with you. Sorry to
interrupt, but tell me, what's your
national team?

CARL
France.

ESMERALDA
Wiped him out!

CARL
Look at the players on the team.

BOUBACAR
Why don't you say you're French in that
case? Why do you say you're Caribbean?

CARL
We are French. What’s your problem?

BOUBACAR
Why don’t you say...

CARL
Our Caribbean islands are French.

BOUBACAR
Why don't you ever say you're French
instead of saying your Caribbean?

CARL
It's the same thing.

BOUBACAR
No, I don’t think so.

CARL
Look at the players we have. Thierry
Henri, Wiltord, Abidal, Thuram.. Just look
at them.

SOULEYMANE
Where does Diarra play?

CARL
Diarra won't ever play in Mali, bro, he's
not crazy enough.

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth, pal, I'm telling you I'm
not your bro! An ape like this jerk...
76.

FRANCOIS
No need to lose your cool.

SOULEYMANE
Look at him, new here and already the big
shot. Shut your goddam mouth.

FRANCOIS

We can talk calmly! This isn't a slanging
match. It's a debate. Souleymane, watch
your language.

SOULEYMANE
I‘ll get you, you Caribbean shit!

ESMERALDA
He's fuming!

Souleymane’s sole reply is to give her the finger.

SOULEYMANE
Clam up. Go get fucked!

FRANCOIS
Enough of your vulgarity!

ESMERALDA
Know where you can put that?

SOULEYMANE
(to Frangois)
I ain't talking to you, man!

FRANCOIS
No, I'm talking to you!

Esmeralda is splitting her sides.

ESMERALDA
But, sir, he doesn’t know what he’s
saying, just forget it.

FRANCOIS

(to Souleymane)
Hey, is that any way to talk to a
teacher?

SOULEYMANE
(to Esmeralda)
Who are you talking to, dog-face? Shut
your mouth!
77.

FRANCOIS
That’s enough now. Just get your things
and come with me.

SOULEYMANE
I’ll fuck you all!
FRANCOIS
Hey! I’m talking to you!
SOULEYMANE
Don't start yelling at me, okay.
(to Carl)

I'll get you, faggot.

FRANCOIS
You just can't talk normally, can you?
Nobody else moves.

SOULEYMANE
You calling me an ape? Fuck you, man!

I/E. STAIRS & YARD - DAY

They slowly come down the stairs. Frangois is seething.
The teenager drags his feet, forcing his teacher to come
back up a few steps from time to time. The scene
resembles a silent duel.

The crossing of the yard is just as laborious.

FRANCOIS
Hurry it up! Move it!

The teenager stubbornly continues to advance at his own
pace.

SOULEYMANE
Hey, get your hands off me!

FRANCOIS
Aren't you sick of assing around?

These words have echoed around the yard. Frangois then
notices that the other students are pressing to the
windows of the classroom, watching them and laughing.

Souleymane has noticed them too and stops to do up his
shoelaces, just to show off. Frangois tries to recover
his calm but we can tell that he is still on edge. He
waits patiently for Souleymane. After taking his time
doing his laces, Souleymane sets off towards the
principal's office again.
78.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Outside the principal's office, they look each other up
and down one last time, then Frangois knocks on the door.
The principal tells them to come in.

PRINCIPAL
Hello.

FRANCOIS
Sorry to bother you. I have a
troublemaker who's been disrespectful in
class.

Souleymane sits down almost instinctively opposite the
principal's desk.

PRINCIPAL
I didn't ask you to sit down, Souleymane.

FRANCOIS
I have to get back to my class, sorry.

PRINCIPAL
I’ll see to this.

Frangois leaves the room.

PRINCIPAL
Sit down now. All right, I'm listening.
Will you tell me what happened? You think
it's normal that a teacher should have to
leave his class to bring you to the
principal's office?

The teenager seems determined to remain silent.

INT. CLASS MEETING - DAY

Around a table set out in a U-shape, the class meeting
brings together all the teachers that work with the
class, members of the school’s administration and a
parents' representative. As for the students, they are
represented by Esmeralda and Louise who keep chattering
together in low voices.

PRINCIPAL
"Results too uneven. Too much talking in
class." Now let's move on to Louise,
present here today.
79.

VINCENT
The biggest disaster in the whole class.
What can we do with you? No, good work!

PRINCIPAL
Always good, I'd say.

SOPHIE
Excellent and it's a joy having a student
like her. We have to say so when it
happens...

PRINCIPAL
So, shall we offer this young lady a
commendation?

OLIVIER
I'm sorry, but I don't totally agree with
you. She's relatively well-placed in the
class from a numerical angle. But a
commendation? There's room for progress,
huge room for progress and I don't think
her general attitude really merits a
commendation.

FRANCOIS
That's the problem with commendations.
Are they purely numerical and
mathematical or are they also to do with
her attitude and behavior as top of the
class?

VINCENT
Hold on, that means, to get a
commendation, you have to be an excellent
student and, at the same time, be a class
leader? No!

PRINCIPAL
Please, please!

FRANCOIS
A commendation carries a certain weight!

PRINCIPAL
So a commendation this term. Louise is
intelligent and will realize she can do
better to satisfy you. Now, Chérif. Our
friend Chérif.

HERVE
I have a problem with Chérif. He's a kid
with abilities, he could do well.

(MORE)
80.

HERVé (CONT'D)
I could easily give him 17/20 but he
spends so much time talking and
disturbing the class, his average grade
is poor. And that's a pity.

VINCENT
His behavior's irregular. He can be a
disaster and you can't do a thing with
him or he can be really good.

PRINCIPAL
So what do we put for Chérif? A warning
about his work or his behavior?

SOPHIE
For me, behavior, not work.

RACHEL
In my class, it's more his work.

PRINCIPAL
It's more like a work problem, looking at
his grades. Mathematics: 6. French: 8.
History and geography: 9. English: 9.5...

ESMERALDA
(hurrying out, splitting her
sides)
Excuse me!

PRINCIPAL
Science: 12. Music: 11.

FRANCOIS
His grades are pretty low but I have the
impression that it's more a behavior
problem. Why don't we put that for now
and say he can work harder?

PRINCIPAL
So I'll put, "Chérif can succeed as long
as his attitude changes in relation to
his work." Let's move on to Souleymane.

ANNE
Souleymane... Someone else can start.

Knowing smiles around the room.

PRINCIPAL
What do we say?

SOPHIE
Nothing good!
81.

PRINCIPAL
What else?

FRANCOIS
I think we already discussed him in the
first term. We said it all. He has huge
weaknesses, notably in written French. I
don't think there's anything particularly
new this term.

Esmeralda comes back in, having calmed down.

PRINCIPAL
Feeling better, Esmeralda?

ESMERALDA
Yes.

PRINCIPAL

I didn't know being class rep was such
fun. We were talking about Souleymane.

OLIVIER
In relation to what Frangois just said,
he forgot his things most of the time
this term and, I have to admit, didn't do
much.

FREDERIC
But it's not just that, it's way beyond
that. He's more and more unruly. He
prevents the others from working.

Esmeralda butts in, raising her hand to speak.

ESMERALDA
May I say something?

PRINCIPAL
Yes, Esmeralda, if you put the biscuits
away. Remember, you aren't allowed to eat
in a classroom.

ESMERALDA
Well, his overall grade has gone from
6.75 to 7.25... So...

PRINCIPAL
Yes, but we're not discussing his grades
but his behavior for now.
82.

VINCENT
I have the impression we need to consider
disciplinary action. His attitude's

wrong.

ANNE
It's simple. Every other class, I throw
him out.

PATRICK

I don't even throw him out anymore. He's
only too happy when I do, so it makes no
sense.

FRANCOIS
I don't think disciplinary action will
help because things will get really bad
then.

FREDERIC
They're already really bad! It's gone too
far. It's like he's mad at the others for
being normal students.

PRINCIPAL
I'll remind you, Mr. Marin, you brought
him to me only yesterday.

FRANCOIS
Yes, but it was this year's first
incident. He was disrespectful, so I had
to set a limit. I did what I did but I
don't think it will go any further than
that. Since the start of the year, I
don't have any real complaints, apart
from yesterday.

FREDERIC
But our job isn't to make sure students
sit quietly at the back and don't cause
any trouble. We have to bring these kids
out!

Esmeralda and Louise are amused by this lively discussion
between two of their teachers. The principal looks as if
he wants to take things in hand.

FRANCOIS
I won't do that with threats or
punishment. I'd rather stress his good
work because some things interest him. He
can come out with some pretty good stuff.
83.

FREDERIC
Simply because he does something positive
now and then, we let him sink and wallow
in his hole and we do nothing? You just
want to buy social harmony.

PRINCIPAL
That said, what do we say? What do we do?
A warning?

FRANCOIS
I don't think a warning's what he needs.
Maybe we should say Souleymane has
reached his limit because he's limited
scholastically.

ESMERALDA (0.S.)
Shit, that’s tough. He shouldn’t say a
thing like that!

Esmeralda and Louise pretend to be shocked by Frangois’
words but burst out laughing.

PRINCIPAL
Okay, that's all well and good but I'm
dim and have a line to fill. What do we
put?

Frédéric and Frangois remain silent.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

FRANCOIS
Three rhymes, three rhymes per verse.
What do you call that? Verses of three
lines... Wey?

WEY
A tercet.

FRANCOIS
A tercet, very good. And if there were
four rhymes, Wey, what would it be?

WEY
A quatrain.

FRANCOIS
A quatrain, it's easy. From “quatre”,
four. Tercet, three rhymes. Quatrain,
four. How many syllables per line? Can
you tell me that? Khoumba?
84.

KHOUMBA
I know there are ten.
FRANCOIS
You know there are ten?
KHOUMBA
Want me to show you?
FRANCOIS
Yes?
KHOUMBA

“Noir dans la neig-e et dans la brum-e.”
That makes ten.

FRANCOIS
If you say, “Noir dans la neig-e et dans
la brum-e,” you have two extra syllables
by counting the mute Es. Don't count

them, they're mute. “Noir dans la neige
et dans la brume,” that makes eight. If
we count precisely, underlining each

syllable, we have "ils 6-coutent" - I'll
come back to that one - two
octosyllables...

In the middle of the lesson, Rabah suddenly speaks out to
talk about the previous day’s class meeting.

RABAH
Sir, there’s a problem!
FRANCOIS
and one four-syllable line. What is it?
RABAH
11.47, that makes... 11.5?
FRANCOIS
Is 11.47 the number of syllables here?
RABAH
Rounded up, I mean. No, it’s my grade.
It’s down!
FRANCOIS
Can you tell me what that has to do with
poetry?
RABAH

They lowered my grade! 11.47 is 11.5.
85.

FRANCOIS

Who gave you your grade? You shouldn't
have it yet, not until you get your
reports.

RABAH
Esmeralda told me.

FRANCOIS
Ah... So the class reps did do something
after all, they passed on the grades.

LOUISE
Are you kidding? I took a load of notes!

FRANCOIS
I got the impression you weren't really
following the meeting.

Louise brandishes a book full of notes.

LOUISE
Hey, I wrote all this!

FRANCOIS

Louise, I'm delighted. You've done a good
job passing on information. Let's get
back to this poem. The rule is to count
in front of a consonant and not in front
of a...

The two girls look at each other, outraged.
As Frangois finishes writing a poem on the board,

Souleymane, who doesn’t want to leave things at this,
butts in.

SOULEYMANE

Sir, sir, I have a question.
FRANCOIS

What?
SOULEYMANE

I heard you really wiped me out at the
meeting yesterday.

FRANCOIS
Another remark about poetry, I see!

SOULEYMANE
No, I'm not talking about poetry.
86.

FRANCOIS
Yes, I know you're not talking about
poetry. What do you mean, "wiped you
out"?

SOULEYMANE
I dunno. You wiped me out.

FRANCOIS
Some people, not me, said if you carry on
like this.. Some teachers said if you
carry on like this, you'll be in trouble,
not "wiped out".

SOULEYMANE
Yeah, but that's revenge. I don't get it.
Why do all the teachers go for revenge?

FRANCOIS
What do you mean? What does it have to do
with revenge?

SOULEYMANE
If you say stuff about me getting in
trouble and all, that's revenge, right?

FRANCOIS
Revenge has nothing to do with it.
SOULEYMANE
What do you mean, it’s not revenge?
FRANCOIS
Not at all...
SOULEYMANE

It is, it’s revenge.

FRANCOIS
We're not on the streets here. It's a
warning. Our goal isn't revenge, it's
discipline. Get the difference?

SOULEYMANE
I don't get it.

FRANCOIS
When a judge sends someone to jail, he
doesn't do it to get revenge. It's to
help society run smoothly.

SOULEYMANE
I call it revenge, you just want to get
revenge. You're riffed with me.
87.

FRANCOIS
Are you out of your mind? You think all I
care about is revenge? I wake up and say,
"I'll get Souleymane today"?

Esmeralda reacts immediately.

ESMERALDA
You say you have other things to do but
you insulted him yesterday anyhow. He
really laid into you!

FRANCOIS
No I didn’t, absolutely not.

ESMERALDA
What was it he said, Louise?

Louise checks her notes and turns to Souleymane.

LOUISE
He said you were "limited". I underlined
it, I was so shocked.

Souleymane is slightly dazed by this remark. He seems
humiliated that such words should have emerged before the
whole class.

SOULEYMANE
I’m what? I’m limited?

Frangois, startled that Souleymane’s feelings may have
been hurt, focuses his anger on the two girls.

FRANCOIS
Brilliant, brilliant... Esmeralda and
Louise, what's your role as class reps
exactly? You represent the students to
help this class work or you stir up
trouble between me and the students? What
do you do exactly?

LOUISE
We just do our job, that’s all.

ESMERALDA
Wicked! We report on the meeting.

FRANCOIS
Yes, of course. I didn't realize. When I
saw you sniggering at the meeting like
that, I felt bad, you see? I felt bad for
you.

(MORE)
Reactions

88.

FRANgGOIS (CONT'D)
It wasn't the place or time to do that.
It didn't look very serious, quite
frankly, okay?

ESMERALDA
Yeah, well nobody minded in any case.
FRANCOIS
Oh, yes, they did.
ESMERALDA
Only you!
FRANCOIS

No, no, Esmeralda, it bothered me and I
think I can say it bothered the others
too.

ESMERALDA
No, no, it only bothered you.

FRANCOIS
Sorry, but laughing like that, in the
middle of a class meeting, made you look
like two skanks.

LOUISE
What?

from the class.

ESMERALDA
Have you just lost it?

STUDENT (0.S.)
That’s bad!

LOUISE
Sir, you can't dump on your students.

FRANCOIS
The word is "insult".

ESMERALDA
Have you lost it, insulting on us as
skanks.

FRANCOIS
No, no, you say "dump on" or "insult".
It's either one or the other, okay.

ESMERALDA
Yeah, keep on talking.
89.

FRANCOIS
In fact, I never said you were skanks. I
said that at one point in the meeting you
acted like skanks. Understand?

CARL
Hey, sir, don't try to con us, you said
skanks. That's too easy!

FRANCOIS
No, no, I'm not trying to con you, I'm
just explaining the difference. You
understand what I mean?

CARL
No, no, I don’t understand.

Souleymane, who has been seething since the start of the
discussion, suddenly explodes.

SOULEYMANE
Sir, you don't talk to girls like that!
What are you thinking of?

FRANCOIS
Hey, you're going to tell us how to talk
to girls, the way you talk to others! You
always insult everybody!

SOULEYMANE
He wants revenge! The old teach is no use
now, he wants revenge on the girls!

FRANCOIS
No way! The noble knight riding to the
girls’ rescue won't wash, Souleymane!

SOULEYMANE
You don't talk to me, man! You don't talk
to me like that, wacko!

FRANCOIS
I told you before, show some respect for
your teachers!

SOULEYMANE
I will if I want!

FRANCOIS
I told you, you're heading for trouble
unless you show some respect!

SOULEYMANE
Think you're tough?
FRANCOIS
It’s not about toughness, it’s about
discipline and respect!

SOULEYMANE
I'll take you anytime, man!

Souleymane starts putting his things away to avoid

looking Frangois in the eye.

KHOUMBA
Hey, cut it out, stop playing the big
shot. Calm down! Stop playing the big
shot.

SOULEYMANE
Stay outta this!

BOUBACAR
Souleymane, cut it out, bro!

Fearing that a fight is about to break out, Frangois

hurries over.

SOULEYMANE
Hey, don't touch me!

FRANCOIS

You're crazy. You can't just walk out of

my class! Are you nuts?

90.

Souleymane stands, kicking over his chair that crashes to
the floor, and walks over to the door. As he passes, Carl

roughly grabs his arm.

CARL
Calm down, calm down!
SOULEYMANE
Let go of me!
FRANCOIS

Stop it now! Enough! Where are you going?

SOULEYMANE
I said let go of me, fucker!

FRANCOIS
Pathetic...

To break free of Carl’s grip, Souleymane tries to hit him

with his bag. He miscalculates and strikes Khoumba’s
head. She screams as she lifts her hand to her eyebrow

that starts bleeding.
gl.

KHOUMBA
Fuck...

Souleymane goes out as Khoumba’s blood forms a puddle on
the floor at her feet.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Close-up on a sheet of paper on which Frangois starts
writing: “Incident report, April 11, 2008”. Frangois is
alone in a corner of the deserted staff room. He writes a
few words, then breaks off, reads what he has just
written, and puts his pen down.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

The principal reads the report attentively as Frangois
watches in concern. When he finishes reading, the
principal remains silent for a second.

PRINCIPAL
So, what do we do? I think we need to
convene the disciplinary committee, don't
we? This is starting to add up. It begins
with disrespect, then the fight, with a
student injured, and finally he leaves
the class without permission.

FRANCOIS
Yes, but there was only one incident and
it all spread out from there. One thing
led to another, a chain reaction.

The principal stands and concludes:

PRINCIPAL

Well, what I can do is take a protective
measure, since this is so serious, by
suspending Souleymane for 48 hours.
That'll give us a little time to reach a
decision. Shall we do that? However, I
need to see you tomorrow. Could you come
to my office? That would be better.

FRANCOIS
Goodbye.

PRINCIPAL
Goodbye.

Frangois leaves the room.
92.

INT. CORRIDOR & STAIRS - DAY

At the door of the office, Julie, the year supervisor, is
waiting for him.

JULIE
Frangois! I need a word with you. There's
a rumor going around...

They continue their conversation as they head along the
corridor to the yard.

FRANCOIS
A rumor?

JULIE
Yes. Some students came to see me and
told me.. you insulted them in class.

FRANCOIS
Who told you that? Louise and Esmeralda,
was it?

JULIE

They told me you called them skanks and
that led to the incident with Souleymane.

FRANCOIS
And you go right ahead and believe them?

JULIE
Yes, well, no.. That's why I needed to see
you. You didn't mention it in your
incident report so.. yes, I wanted to
know.

FRANCOIS
I didn't mention it because I didn't
mention it. What can I say?

JULIE
Did you do it or not?

FRANCOIS
What?

JULIE
Did you...
(she greets someone who
passes)
Did you call them skanks?

FRANCOIS
Yes, but Souleymane's another matter!
93.

JULIE
I know it had nothing to do with him. But
word's getting around. People are
talking. I wanted to let you know.

FRANCOIS
Well, thanks for letting me know.

Frangois has spoken absently because, out of the window,
he has just spotted Esmeralda in the yard.

EXT. YARD - DAY

Frangois hurries across the yard towards Esmeralda as if
he were ready for a fight.

FRANCOIS
Hey, you two. You complained about me to
the year supervisor. Thanks a lot!

They step away from the other students. Esmeralda, caught
off guard, stammers a little.

ESMERALDA
You're welcome.

FRANCOIS
You could have talked to me about it,
couldn’t you?

Louise comes over to her friend and joins the
conversation.

LOUISE
When a teacher complains about us, he
sees the year supervisor, we can do the
same thing, right?

FRANCOIS
No, it doesn't work both ways.

He has raised his voice. A group has formed around them.
We notice that Khoumba has a dressing over her eyebrow.

LOUISE
Of course it’s the same. Of course it is.

FRANCOIS
Absolutely not. What were you after by
doing this?

ESMERALDA
We wanted to see you punished like us!
94.

FRANCOIS
To see me punished...
ESMERALDA
Yes.
FRANCOIS
You're going to get me punished?
ESMERALDA
Yes, you insulted us, you get punished!
FRANCOIS
And where will that get you, me being
punished?
ESMERALDA
At least I'll have spoken out.
FRANCOIS
Great, that's a lot of use.
ESMERALDA
I mean, do you even know what "skank"
means?
FRANCOIS

That's not the problem because I never
called you skanks!

ESMERALDA
Yes, you did, you called us skanks. For
me, skank means prostitute.

FRANCOIS
Not at all.

ESMERALDA
It does.

FRANCOIS

For me, it doesn't mean that. It's
nothing important at all, just a girl
laughing stupidly. It’s no worse than
that.

Esmeralda turns to the circle of girls around her.

ESMERALDA
Hey, skank means prostitute, right?

GIRLS
You bet!
95.

KHOUMBA
Will Souleymane get expelled?

Frangois is caught off his guard.

Carl butts

FRANCOIS
Of course not.. but...

KHOUMBA
Will he get a disciplinary hearing?

FRANCOIS
We don't know yet. It's a possibility.
Stop yelling before anything's decided.

KHOUMBA
It's all settled anyway. We know that!

FRANCOIS
It isn’t. Why do you say that?

KHOUMBA
Because. It’s always the same.

ESMERALDA
I’s always the same!

FRANCOIS
You know, you're in no position to talk.
You're the one who got hurt during the
incident.

KHOUMBA
So? He didn't mean it. There was a metal
thing in his bag.

FRANCOIS
Whatever happened, he blew a fuse and
that's bad.

in.

CARL
Sir, anyone can blow a fuse.

FRANCOIS
Yes, they can, but they can calm down
after too!

CARL
That’s not so sure.

FRANCOIS
You calmed down, right?
96.

CARL
No.

FRANCOIS
You're a lot calmer since you got here.

CARL
No, I haven’t calmed down. You don’t know
me better than I know myself!

FRANCOIS
All the teachers say your attitude is
perfect now. So don't try to pretend
otherwise.

CARL
So what's the idea? You think you've
tamed me?

FRANCOIS
No, it doesn't mean we've tamed you. But
being sent here by a disciplinary
committee helped you understand things,
see?

CARL
It didn't help me. I don't understand
your shit!

FRANCOIS
In making that decision about you, maybe
your old teachers wanted to help you and
we'll do the same for Souleymane.

CARL
Sorry, but I say teachers who expel
students are fuckers.

ESMERALDA
Right on!

FRANCOIS
Bravo, you want to repeat that?

CARL
Yeah, they’re fuckers.

FRANCOIS
This is incredible. Everyone goes wild
over some word I said. You say fucker and
I shouldn't react?

CARL
I don’t give a damn, they’re fuckers!
97.

FRANCOIS
Cut it out!

ESMERALDA
Hey! You say skanks, we say fucker. You
may not like it but it's the same. It's
the same!

FRANCOIS
First of all, the two words are nothing
alike! And if you can't understand that a
teacher can say certain things that
students can't say, well.. We'll never get
anywhere!

KHOUMBA
We're not allowed to say nothing. We're
not allowed to say nothing!

FRANCOIS
Rubbish! You keep talking all the time!
You never stop speaking!

CARL
Whenever we talk, you yell. What is this?

FRANCOIS
Enough!

Frangois, at a loose end, leaves the group.

INT. HALLWAY - CANTEEN - DAY

As he enters the canteen hallway, Khoumba catches up with
him. She is alone and looks worried.

KHOUMBA
Sir! Sir!
FRANCOIS
What?
KHOUMBA
Tell me, will Souleymane get a hearing or
not?

Frangois, surprised by the emotion in Khoumba’s voice,
turns to look at her.

FRANCOIS
Give it a rest! You sound like you want
him to. It fires you up.
98.

KHOUMBA
Do you know what'll happen if he's
expelled?

FRANCOIS

He'll change schools.

KHOUMBA
No, he won't change schools.

FRANCOIS
He will, it's automatic. It's obligatory.
That goes for Souleymane too.

KHOUMBA
Do you know his father?

FRANCOIS
I've seen him once or twice.

KHOUMBA
No, you don’t know him! If Souleymane is
expelled, his dad'll send him back to
their village!

FRANCOIS
Don't get overdramatic.

KHOUMBA
He'll go back to Mali!

FRANCOIS
I think we all need to keep our heads
here. It's okay, don't worry.

He walks away.

INT. CANTEEN - DAY

Frangois comes into the deserted canteen. There are trays
on the tables, the leftovers of lunch. He sits down ina
He looks a little lost.

We find him a little later smoking a cigarette as two
WOMEN clear the trays away at the other end of the room,
putting them on a trolley. On reaching him, one of them
points to Frangois’ cigarette.

CLEANING WOMAN
You can't smoke here, sir.

FRANCOIS
Yes, I know, but since I was alone...
99.

CLEANING WOMAN
The rules hold for everyone.

Frangois puts out his cigarette in a dirty plate. The
woman takes the tray, glaring at him.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Frangois is with the other teachers, talking about
Souleymane. Frédéric speaks up.

FREDERIC
Okay, you went too far with those girls.
But we all screw up. It doesn't excuse
what Souleymane did.

RACHEL
Listen, Frangois, he's right. I saw
Khoumba. Her face was all bloody. What he
did is unacceptable.

SOPHIE
That’s for sure.

FRANCOIS
That's another thing, her bloody face...
His bag hit her by accident. A split
eyebrow bleeds a lot. That's all.

SOPHIE
You can’t ignore it!

HERVE
Come on, Frangois, don't take it to
heart. You've seen how they talk to us?

FRANCOIS
How's that relevant? Souleymane is going
to get a disciplinary hearing and he'll
be expelled.

SOPHIE
That's kind of logical.

FRANCOIS
So let's talk about that. How many
hearings were there last year? Twelve at
least.

RACHEL
Not that many.
100.

SOPHIE
Yes, he could be right.

FRANCOIS
I know, I'm on the committee so I saw
them all. An average of two a month,
twelve in all, with an expulsion each
time.

HERVE
Come on, the hearing is where we talk
things over. Okay, so twelve students
were expelled but maybe there was no
other solution.

RACHEL
Twelve out of twelve means there wasn't
much of a discussion unfortunately!

FREDERIC
But twelve out of twelve just means... when
a student has a hearing, it's too late.

SOPHIE
Or that it was justified.

FRANCOIS
Okay, things happen that lead to a
hearing. But then what happens? What do
we expect from a hearing?

PATRICK
There are all the prior stages. You know
that, Frangois. The pre-disciplinary
committees, we inform the parents, the
students are warned...

RACHEL
Not in this case.

SOPHIE
We've no time to.

ANNE
It’s pretty rare.

FRANCOIS
It's rare because we know we have this
ultimate punishment that allows us to
ignore the prior steps. And even if we
did use them, the simple fact of
expelling a student.. I don't know, it's a
disavowal of everything we have tried.
101.

HERVE
Okay, but at the same time it's
Souleymane's chance to justify himself.

SOPHIE
Sure! Students at hearings don't speak.
They're scared. They're paralyzed.

Frangois then decides to use what Khoumba told him.

FRANCOIS

Exactly. Let me sum this up. He'll get a
disciplinary hearing, he'll be expelled
and maybe even sent back to Mali.

ANNE
You're being overdramatic.

FRANCOIS

No, I'm not. Students who know him better
than any of us here, who know his father,
say that he is likely to send him back to
Mali after this.

PATRICK
Some kids are threatened with boarding
school but it never happens!

ANNE
It can happen!

FREDERIC
Come on, a lot of parents spend their
time threatening their kids with that.
But you can't take it into account.

FRANCOIS

Even if there’s just a slight risk that a
hearing could lead to him being sent
back, I don't think I can take that risk.
That's all.

SOPHIE
It's like when you hesitate over
punishing a kid because when he goes
home, once that door closes, he'll get a
beating from his parents. We've all seen
that. But we still have to punish them
when they go too far. Whatever the
consequences, which don't concern you.
102.

FRANCOIS
So I ignore that? I know punishment can
have such a consequence but I turn a
blind eye, I don't want to know, is that
it?

SOPHIE
No, but I understand...

HERVE
Hold on a second. You can't take it into
account in every case or you won't get
anywhere. The violence, him being sent
back... True, you have to consider it but
after a while...

SOPHIE
No more Christmas presents.. It happens,
yes.

FREDERIC

Afterwards, it's a question of principle.
We each have a role to play. We can't
substitute ourselves for the parents.

FRANCOIS
Sorry, but if I rewind the movie, it's a
weird chain of events. It starts with
reprimands when Souleymane starts
screwing up, forgets his things, or talks
back. We punish him. Again and again,
until a disciplinary hearing leading to
who knows what. Little by little,
everything gets out of hand.

FREDERIC
Sure, if you look at it that way, it's
really shocking. But, once again, the
school won't be expelling Souleymane.
He's been gone for a while.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
Frangois leaves the staff room. He walks along the
corridor, thinking.

EXT. YARD - DAY

The students start to form into their classes as they
continue to horse about in the yard.
103.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

Frangois knocks on the door and comes in. The principal
doesn’t seem to be very surprised to see him.

PRINCIPAL
Frangois... I didn't expect you so soon.
Have you reached a decision?

FRANCOIS
Well, I don't think I really have much
choice.

He sits down a little heavily on the chair facing the
principal. He doesn't say a word. The principal goes on
in a kindly voice.

PRINCIPAL
By the way, Julie told me you had a
heated exchange with two girls in your

class.

FRANCOIS
Yes, the two class reps but it happened
first so..

PRINCIPAL

You apparently called them "skanks".

FRANCOIS
Let's say that, yes.

PRINCIPAL
Well, that complicates things but the
problem remains. I'd like you to mention
it in your report. I don't want it used
against us at the disciplinary hearing.
Don't bother hiding it, just write it
down.

FRANCOIS
I understand.

PRINCIPAL
I'll let you go back over this before we
launch the procedure.

FRANCOIS
So I.. I just need to add the...

PRINCIPAL
Yes, yes, but without going into detail.
Does that suit you.
104.

Frangois shows no reaction.

FRANCOIS
Okay.

INT. STAFF ROOM - DAY

Frangois, alone in the staff room again, rewrites his
incident report.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

The tables have been set out in a U-shape in the meeting
room. The people come in.

PARENTS’ REPS
Hello. Hello, sir.

PRINCIPAL
Please sit down.

Souleymane and his mother sit on one side, with the two
student representatives. The teaching staff sits on
another side and the parents’ representatives on the
third side of the U.

Frangois remains silent and tries in vain to catch
Souleymane’s eye. The boy, stubborn, stares at the
principal who leads the debate, sitting between Julie,
the class supervisor, and the bursar, Monsieur Pierre.

PRINCIPAL
(to Julie)
Can you take the minutes?

We fast-forward to the heart of the meeting as the
principal reads from Frangois’ report.

PRINCIPAL
"Carl tried to reason with him and stop
him. Souleymane broke free, swinging his
bag that hit Khoumba in the face. Then he
left, insulting everyone and slamming the
door. I didn't go after him because I
needed to help Khoumba whose eyebrow was
bleeding." Those are the facts that led
to today's hearing. Madame, it doesn't
mean Souleymane is a bad boy. That's not
what we're saying.

(MORE)
105.

PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)

But, sometimes, a student in a class,
through voluntary or involuntary
behavior, can create an atmosphere that
prevents the class from working and
getting ahead.

(Souleymane translates)
Do you understand what we're saying?

FREDERIC

If I may say something, it's true that
there had been a number of signs that
should have warned us. We could have
reacted sooner. But now we have to deal
with an incident that is fairly violent
and that's simply unacceptable. I'd like
to know if you realize that, Souleymane?

SOPHIE
You see, we're not saying you're
deliberately violent. The problem is you
can't control what you say and what you
do.

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane, we'd like to hear you. You're
here to express your point of view. Go
ahead.

SOULEYMANE
I don't give a damn. I've got nothing to
say. Do whatever you want to do.

His mother says something in Malian. She seems to be
telling him off for his aggressive reaction to the
teachers’ accusations.

PRINCIPAL
Excuse Mme...

Souleymane’s mother continues to speak in Malian.

SOPHIE
Can you translate?

SOULEYMANE
She says I'm a good boy. I do my
homework. I help my brothers and sisters
with their work when I can. I always wash
the dishes and help her when I can.

PRINCIPAL
Madam, we don't doubt that Souleymane is
a good son. That's not the problem. I'd
like to get back to his school record.
106.

PARENTS’ REP #1
Excuse me, but could we focus on the
facts here? Firstly, I'd like to say that
we're surprised to see the teacher
involved in the incident on this
committee. We find that highly irregular.

BURAK’S MOTHER
(another parents’ rep)
It's true. It's odd to be both judge and
litigant.

PRINCIPAL
First of all, Mr. Marin was elected to
the administrative board as the teachers'
representative. Moreover, I think that
the incident that occurred in Mr. Marin's
class doesn't involve the teacher
directly.

PARENTS’ REP #1
I'm sorry, but you mention some harsh
words spoken by the teacher. Apparently,
if I understand rightly, you used the
word "skanks" to describe the class reps.
And that's a problem.

FRANCOIS
I did say that but it wasn't something
that concerned Souleymane. I think he
used the excuse of a rather heated
exchange with those two students to
express the bad mood he was in that day.

PARENTS’ REP #1
He tried to defend them. So I feel that
it's relevant.

Frangois, awkward, prefers not to reply while Frédéric,
annoyed, answers for him.

FREDERIC
I'm sorry, but absolutely nothing
justifies being disrespectful to a
teacher, insulting everyone and leaving a
class without permission.

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane, do you have anything to say?

SOULEYMANE
I don't know. What can I say?
107.

SOULEYMANE’S MOTHER
Sir, madame...

She then continues in Malian.

SOPHIE
Souleymane?

PRINCIPAL
What did your mother say?

SOULEYMANE
The same thing as before.

His mother says something else in Malian.

PRINCIPAL
Yes, Souleymane?

SOULEYMANE
She apologizes on my behalf.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Souleymane and his mother sit down on a bench in the
corridor. They don’t speak or even look at each other.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

In the meeting room, the vote is under way. Everyone
taking part in the meeting drops a small piece of paper
into a box that is passed around. Everyone is silent.

INT. CORRIDOR & MEETING ROOM - DAY

The year supervisor comes to fetch Souleymane and his
mother who are still in the same position.

JULIE
You can come back in now.

They stand and follow her into the room. As soon as they
sit down, the principal starts speaking.

PRINCIPAL
Madame, the committee has conferred and
has decided to expel Souleymane from the
school for good. You will receive the
ruling by registered mail and have eight
days to appeal. We shall do our best to
find Souleymane another school.
108.

Souleymane translates for his mother who stands and picks
up her bag.

SOULEYMANE’S MOTHER
Goodbye, sir, madame...

Souleymane too stands and goes out with looking back as
the principal continues to address him.

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane, come to see me before the end
of the week, please.

EXT. YARD - DAY

Souleymane and his mother cross the yard to the exit.
From the window, Frangois watches them go.

INT. CLASS —- DAY

For the students’ final class, the atmosphere is relaxed.
We can sense that the tension of the year has eased. The
students are like actors after a show.

Frangois invites the students to weigh up the past year:
what they have learned, what they particularly liked.

LOUISE
Mathematical proportionality.

FRANCOIS
This year, you learned mathematical
proportionality. All right.

BURAK
I liked science.

FRANCOIS

What you learned, not what you liked. If
you liked it, you learned. So what did
you learn in science?

BURAK
All about volcanoes, earthquakes, plates...
Convergence and divergence, movement of
the Earth's plates... It was fascinating.

FRANCOIS
It interested you?

BURAK
Yeah.
109.

FRANCOIS
That's good.

BOUBACAR
Well, in mathematics, trigonometry,
Pythagoras' theorem, Thalés' theorem...

FRANCOIS

I'll stop you there. You can't sit there
and brag you learned Pythagoras' theorem.
Recite it for us.

BOUBACAR
If, in a triangle.. two sides are equal
to.. If the square root.. If the square of
two sides is equal to the square... the
square of the hypotenuse... then the
triangle's a right-angled triangle.

FRANCOIS
More or less, yes.

BOUBACAR
It's spot on.

FRANCOIS
All right. If you say so, I believe you.

ANGELICA
In history, I learned about triangular
trade. The fact that ships left Europe
with manufactured goods that they took to
Africa to trade for men who'd become
slaves that they took to America to work.
Then they took the money they made back
to Europe. That's triangular trade.

CARL
Chemistry.

FRANCOIS
What in chemistry?

CARL
Combustion.

FRANCOIS

Okay and what's that?

CARL
Blending Fehling's solution and glucose.

FRANCOIS
What do you get?
110.

CARL
Heat up the test-tube and it changes
color.

_ FRANCOIS /
What's the interest in knowing that?

CARL
The interest in knowing that? I dunno.
Why teach it to us if there's no
interest?

DAMIEN
Reproduction.

FRANCOIS
What did you learn about human
reproduction, for instance?

DAMIEN
Human reproduction... Well, the sperm gets
into the ovum, then you wait 9 months,
then you do a sonogram and then it comes
out.

FRANCOIS
The sperm does?
DAMIEN
No, the human being that's inside.
FRANCOIS
Khoumba?
KHOUMBA
Me?
FRANCOIS

Yes. That is your name?

KHOUMBA
Yes. In music, I learned to play the alto
recorder... and in Spanish.

FRANCOIS
You learned to play the recorder in
Spanish?

KHOUMBA
No, in music, I learned to play the alto
recorder. And I learned other stuff in
Spanish.
111.

FRANCOIS
Very good. Can you say something to us in
Spanish?

KHOUMBA
Llegan las vacaciones.

FRANCOIS
And that means?

KHOUMBA
It's the vacation soon or the vacation's
coming.

ESMERALDA
I didn't learn anything.

FRANCOIS
You can't spend 9 months at school and
not learn anything.

ESMERALDA
You can, I'm the living proof.

FRANCOIS
You got something from the books we read.

ESMERALDA
Your books are shite.

FRANCOIS
They're what?

ESMERALDA
They're useless.

FRANCOIS
What about a book you read by yourself?

ESMERALDA
A book I read? Well, there's "The
Republic". The book "The Republic".

FRANCOIS
“The Republic” by Plato?
ESMERALDA
Yeah.
FRANCOIS

You read that? How come you read that?

ESMERALDA
My big sister had it.
112.

FRANCOIS
She does philosophy?
ESMERALDA
No, law.
FRANCOIS

So what's it about?

ESMERALDA
Well, there's this guy...

FRANCOIS
Socrates, his name's Socrates.

ESMERALDA
Yeah, Socrates. This guy, he stops people
in the street and he asks them: "Are you
sure of thinking what you think? Are you
sure of doing what you do?" And so on.
After that, people start getting
confused. They ask questions. The guy's

too much.
FRANCOIS
What does he ask people about?
ESMERALDA
Everything. Love, religion, God, people,
everything.
FRANCOIS

It's good you read it.

ESMERALDA
I know.

She hesitates, then adopts a mischievous tone.

ESMERALDA
It's not a skank's book!

This remark elicits laughter from the students who were
starting to get bored with this discussion about
Socrates. There’s an air of reconciliation in the air.
The ringing of the bell creates a mood of general
euphoria that Frangois calms down.

FRANCOIS
Wait a second! Before you leave, here are
your self-portraits. One by one. When you
have yours, you can go. Each one of you
in turn.
113.

As an end-of-year gift, he hands out the book of self-
portraits that he has had bound. The students are over
the moon as they look for their own texts. A moment of
intense pride. Khoumba leafs through the pages of
Souleymane’s photos in silence.

KHOUMBA
Sir, this is really kind of you.

STUDENT (0.S.)
What is it?

FRANCOIS
These are the self-portraits that you
wrote and that we made up with the class
photo and so on.

(to a student)
You don't have yours?

NASSIM
Sir, seriously, why did you put this
here?

FRANCOIS
You look good in it.

NASSIM
Cut it out!

FRANCOIS
You're like a leader. Have a good
vacation.

NASSIM

Thank you. You too.

The students hurry out. For the first time, Henriette
dares to approach her teacher.

HENRIETTE
Sir?

Frangois looks surprised.

FRANCOIS
Yes? What is it?

HENRIETTE
I didn't learn anything.

FRANCOIS
What? Why are you saying that? That
doesn't mean anything.
114.

The girl is edgy, on the verge of tears.

HENRIETTE
Earlier, all the others said they'd
learned something. Compared to them, I
learned nothing.

FRANCOIS

Come on, you learned as much as them.
They had to think hard too. It's not easy
to remember what you learned off the top
of your head like that.

HENRIETTE

But I don't understand.
FRANCOIS

What do you mean?
HENRIETTE

I don't understand what we do.
FRANCOIS

In French?
HENRIETTE

In everything.
