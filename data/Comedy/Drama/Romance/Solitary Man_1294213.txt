Solitary Man

OPEN IN:

A NEW YORK APARTMENT
Spacious. Modernist furniture. Some black lacquer.

A man’s voice is heard. From his tone, we can tell he’s
used to people listening when he speaks.

BEN (V.O.)
The day I turned thirteen...

TRACK into...

THE BEDROOM...
BEN KALMAN sleeps.

BEN (V.O.)
...Actually, it was the night I
turned thirteen, after the party
and the envelopes and speeches and
all that...

An alarm buzzes. Ben slowly sits up. It is a rare
unguarded moment. He doesn't let anyone see him like
this: untucked, groggy, wearing all of his 55-plus years
on his face. It takes him a long moment to reach for his
bathrobe and put it on.

BEN (V.O.)
...My father came into my bedroom,
put a hand on my shoulder and
said, “Ben, a lot of guys are
gonna tell you a lot of shit. But
what I’m gonna tell you applies
across the board. Business,
personal, whatever, what-have-
you...

He reaches into a bottle of children’s aspirin, swallows
one without water, and moves to the...

BATHROOM

Ben checks himself in the mirror. Pulls his robe tight.
Slicks his hair with his hands.

BEN (V.0.)
“Son,” he said, “fuck ‘em where
you find ‘em, and leave ‘em where
you fuck ‘em...”

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Ben clears his eyes, splashes water on his face.

BEN (V.O.)
He was either a hundred per cent
right or a hundred per cent wrong.
I’m still not sure which.

Ben takes one more look at himself in the mirror and
leaves the bathroom as Johnny Cash’s version of Solitary
Man begins to play.

CUT TO:

CITY STREETS

CREDITS roll and the song continues as Ben moves through
the Upper East Side streets of Manhattan.

This is Ben as the world sees him: almost sixty but
fighting it hard, he walks with the authoritative air of
a man who usually gets his way.

Note: Throughout, Ben always wears black Armani, black
slacks, black jeans, black sweaters, black shoes. And if
his hair isn’t quite black, it’s certainly not gray
either. He and his Madison Ave. colorist makes sure of
it once a month.

CUT TO:

RIVERSIDE PARK...

Amidst the Bicyclists and joggers competing for space on
the paths that run along the water, is a basketball court
crowded with KIDS, PARENTS, BALLPLAYERS.

SUSAN PORTER, twenty-seven, with big understanding eyes
and a great laugh, stands with her eight-year-old son,
SCOTTY. The two of them are looking up at...

SCOTTY'S BASKETBALL...

Which is caught between the rim and the backboard of a
basketball hoop.

A TEENAGER jumps up, knocks it through the hoop and hands
it back to Scotty.

Susan nudges her son.

SCOTTY
Thanks.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
He turns to Susan.

SCOTTY
If Grandpa was here, he'd have
gotten it for me, right?

SUSAN
He'd have tried.

SCOTTY
Is he really coming this time?

She is about to answer when she sees Ben entering the
park.

SUSAN
There he is. Dad, Dad!

Scotty sees him too. Fist pump.

SCOTTY
Yes! Grandpa, over here! Come
here, Grandpa!

But Ben doesn't seem to notice them. He moves past,
toward a bench on an opposite court.

As he walks by, he quietly speaks to Susan.

BEN
Don't call me that.

SUSAN
What?

He keeps walking. Susan and Scotty move with him, trying
to keep up.

BEN
Don't call me Dad. And you, don't
call me Grandpa. Not now.

SCOTTY
What should I call you?

BEN
You can call me Dad.

SCOTTY
No. That's what I call my dad.

BEN
Okay...Call me Captain Ben.

Susan turns her head.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

SUSAN
Where’s this one?

Ben gestures behind him.

BEN
Back there. You know what, don't
look. You'll screw me up.

Now Susan stops and does an obvious scan of the park.

SUSAN'S POV: A tawdry looking DYE JOB leans against the
park's fence. She might be staring at Ben.

SUSAN
The Miami blonde?

BEN
I saw her checking me out as I
walked through the fence. Here,
take my arm. Maybe she'll think
we're married.

Susan recoils.

SUSAN
Yuk. Daaaad.

BEN
I told you not to call me that.

SUSAN
How's it supposed to help you if
she thinks you're my husband?

BEN
She's about 29, right?

SUSAN
Yeah.

BEN

At that age she's realistic, but
still plenty vain.

SUSAN
Which means...?

BEN
She might have an affair with a
married man, but there's no way
she's gonna fuck a grandfather.
Oh, excuse me Scotty.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

He reaches down, picks up the little boy and gives him a
big hug.

SCOTTY
Can you put me on your shoulders
Captain Ben?

BEN
Sure.

Ben tries to mask the effort it takes him to smoothly
lift the boy onto his shoulders.

When Scotty finally ends up safely perched, Ben whips
around to show off for the fence leaning Girl.

SUSAN
Too late "Captain." Miami left
three minutes ago.

Ben's face shows disappointment. And a hurt back.

CUT TO:

SCOTTY SWINGING...

...Between Ben and Susan as they walk along Broadway
towards Artie’s deli.

BEN
I'm bushed. I have to go home,
take a nap.

SUSAN
A nap.

They let go of Scotty who walks ahead of them, just out
of earshot.

BEN
Jordan called me over at midnight.
By the time we finished and I got
back to my place--

SUSAN
You're pathetic.

BEN
What'd I do? I was sleeping.
Phone rings, she's using her
bedroom voice--

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

SUSAN
You're pathetic because you're
dying to tell me about it. You're
not going to take a nap. You
don't take naps. You just want me
to know you got laid.

BEN
It's not like I'm detailing the
positions we did it in.

A beat. Susan waits for it.

BEN
She was on top. Then I was. Then
she turned over and--

SUSAN
It's not normal for a man to speak
to his daughter this way.

BEN
That’s your husband talking. He’s
provincial. You’re a grown women.

SUSAN
Gary didn’t say anything. I just--

BEN
You can handle it.

SUSAN
That's what you say about Jordan,
right, to justify the fact that
you’re going to toss her ina
dumpster when you're done.

BEN
She’s got the power in this one.
Not me.

SUSAN

No. She's got something you need.
It's different.

And Ben smiles, real warmth behind it. Susan smiles too.

BEN
Why are you the one I can't con?

SUSAN
If you don't want me to reveal you
to the world, you're coming
inside, say hi to mom.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

BEN
No. I can't stay.
SCOTTY
Aw...
SUSAN
So just say hi and go.
BEN
Your mother doesn't like it when I
leave.
SUSAN

Never stopped you before.

Ben doesn't answer. He just puts his hand on Scotty's
shoulder and, using the boy as a shield, enters...

P.J. BERNSTEIN'S DELI

Scotty breaks away from Ben and Susan and runs to the
back of the restaurant into the arms of NANCY KALMAN, a
mid-fifties woman who has kept it together without
surgery, Botox or excess make-up.

She notices Ben. Reacts. Her words may be sharp; her
manner is not. She's actually glad to see him.

NANCY
Ben. I'm surprised you have the
time to drop in. What's the
matter, no more divorcees left to
bed on the east side?

BEN
That's not fair--
NANCY
You're right. I left out the
widows.
She turns to Scotty.
NANCY

Sit down honey.
Scotty scoots in next to her.

SUSAN
Hi, Mom.

Susan bends over, kisses her mom and drops into a chair.
Nancy gestures toward Ben.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

NANCY
Why is it still good to see him?
(to Ben)
Why is it still good to see you?

BEN
Cause you don’t have to live with
me anymore.

NANCY
Well, join us.

Ben hesitates.

BEN
Just a quick hello, can't stay.

But as he says this, Ben's SPIES a TWENTY-YEAR OLD GIRL
alone at an adjacent table. Furtively tries to make eye
contact.

BEN
Well...I'll sit for a minute.

Ben takes a seat that gives him a clear view of the
Twenty-Year Old Girl.

Nancy laughs.

NANCY
You're too old for that one Benny.

BEN
(covering)
What are you talking about?

NANCY
Deny. Always Deny.

They exchange a smile. There is an easiness to the way
they interact.

A waiter comes over to take Ben's order.

WAITER
Can I get you anything?

BEN
I'll have a cheeseburger.

NANCY
Have a turkey burger, Benny.

BEN
I’1l have a cheeseburger.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

NANCY
It's only a matter of time until I
get that phone call.

BEN
You've been expecting that call
for thirty years...

Ben, catching himself, glances to make sure the Young
Female Diner hasn't heard his age. She is reading a
magazine and not paying any attention to them.

SUSAN
Dad, I'm taking Scotty to the
Natural History this weekend.
Gary has to work, so if you want
to come along with us--

BEN
Can't.

Scotty looks up from his Gameboy.

SCOTTY
Why not?

A beat.

BEN
I’d like to, Scotty, but...

Ben hesitates.

BEN
Oh...You’re gonna love this,
Nance.
NANCY
Out with it.
BEN
I'll be up at our alma mater this
weekend.
Both women react.
NANCY
No.
SUSAN
No way.
NANCY

They finally convince you to come
see the Kalman Pavilion?

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED: (3)

BEN
Nope. Jordan and I are taking her
daughter up for her college

interview.
NANCY/SUSAN
You're what?
BEN
I'm introducing her to the dean.
NANCY
How'd you get roped into that?
SUSAN
Doesn't she have a father?
BEN
Apparently he has a life.
NANCY
So why can't she take the girl
herself?
BEN
Because of my 'relationship' with
the dean.
NANCY

Do you even like this Jordan?
No answer.

The women work the tag team into high gear.

SUSAN
You're a sixty year old--
BEN
I am not--
SUSAN

--Close enough, dating a girl
because of her father's
connections.

A Waiter places food on table.

NANCY
You needed your independence,
right, that’s why you left? Now
you're a kept man.

Ben finally catches the eye of the Twenty-year-old Girl,
smiles at her.

(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED: (4)
BENS'S POV: The Twenty-year-old Girl smiles back at him,
the way one smiles at a kindly older person on a park
bench. No heat.

Ben glances back at Nancy who seems to be looking right
through him.

NANCY
Ben?...

BEN
I've got to go.

Ben gives Scotty a kiss on top of his head.

BEN
I'll get you a check next week,
Nance.

NANCY
What about your burger?

BEN
Better for me that I don’t eat it,
right?

NANCY
Okay, Benny. Okay. Have fun up
there.

Ben turns and walks out the door. Nancy, Scotty and
Susan look to each other.

CUT TO:

JORDAN'S BEDROOM...

...Which could be the centerpiece of an Architectural
Digest spread.

BEN
I'm not going.

JORDAN LANGER, late 40s, beautiful, but in an
uncompromising way, lies in bed. Ben stands over her.

Jordan's daughter, ALLYSON LANGER, great looking,
eighteen, with a cool Dalton detachment, leans against a
wall. She is holding a box of tissues in her hand.

JORDAN
You promised.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

12.

BEN
I promised to go with you.

JORDAN
But I'm sick. I can't go.

BEN
So we'll reschedule--

JORDAN
Allyson can't reschedule her
college interview just because I
have the flu.

BEN
I tried to get you to take the
shot--

JORDAN

--I hate shots.

BEN
--And now you have the flu--

Allyson cuts in.

ALLYSON
--It's fine, Mom. I'11 fly up
there myself. In fact, I'd like
that better.

BEN
You see. She doesn't even want my
company. I'd cramp her style--

Allyson speaks under her breath.

ALLYSON
Stomp on it you mean.

Jordan sits up with effort, turns to Ben.

JORDAN
That's exactly why I want an adult
up there with her. Her style
needs some cramping. Otherwise
she might come home pickled.

Allyson snorts.

ALLYSON
I stopped getting drunk in eighth
grade, Mom.

(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED: (2)

JORDAN
Doesn't matter. You are not going
up there alone. Give me a minute
with Benjamin please.

Allyson hands her mother the tissues and leaves. Ben
tries not to let his eyes follow her out.

BEN
I don't think it's a good idea.
JORDAN
Didn't you retire from thinking?
BEN
And we’re sure her father can’t go
with her?--
JORDAN

--He’s in Macau, closing on some
factory or something. Besides, he
makes her too tense.

Jordan blows her nose. Coughs.

BEN
She's not going to be more relaxed
with me. She doesn't even like me
hanging around you.

JORDAN
What she likes doesn't matter.
What's best for her does.

BEN
That's what my mother used to say
as she tucked me into a giant
purple snowsuit the first day of
November every year. I'd sweat
through the thing on the bus to
school, and everyone thought I wet
my pants.

If Jordan even hears this intimate admission, she does
not acknowledge it.

JORDAN
Ben, she puts on this big
independent act because she thinks
she's supposed to, but I know her.
Please do this for me.

Jordan forces herself out of bed, crosses to her desk,
takes a piece of paper out of the printer.

(CONTINUED)
14,
CONTINUED: (3)

JORDAN
Before I forget, I just got the
confirmation emailed to me. I
printed it for you. They’re
sending a guy out tomorrow
morning.

BEN
And it’s all prepped?

JORDAN
It is. So think of it like a
family weekend. First you’1l go
have the meeting my father
arranged, and then you’1l1 take my
daughter up to her college
interview.

It’s an order. Jordan holds out the piece of paper. Ben
takes it.

BEN (PRE-LAP)
Location isn't the only thing that
matters, of course...

CUT TO:

FOUR WAY INTERSECTION, SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY - DAY

CLOSE ON: An artist’s rendering of a state-of-the-art
car dealership. A giant red sign in the foreground of
the image says ‘Kalman Motors.’

BEN
...But anyone can see, this is a
hell of an open point.

PULL BACK from the mock-up to reveal...
Ben striding with purpose across a large undeveloped lot.

A step behind him is an automotive company exec, PETE
HARTOFILIS.

PETE
Nice traffic patterns.

BEN
Nice? Outstanding! With my
private banking relationships,
I’1l be up and running in no time.
And this zip code spends.
Daughter graduates high-school,
get her an SUV with six airbags.

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

15.

BEN (CONT'D)
Son moves into his own place, put
him in a two-seater with some zip--

PETE
Your old flagship--

BEN
--Was north of here. Twenty-five
miles. The name's still strong in
this community--

PETE
--Our research certainly shows
that the name is known in this
community. But the negative
numbers...

BEN
I'll sponsor the little league,
the soccer, the school car washes.
Negatives will disappear.

PETE
Mr. Kalman, I'm going to speak
freely. Out of respect. I'm
recommending that you get your
dealership. Because the numbers
make sense. Because my first job
was in the finance department of
one of your places. Because I
grew up watching your commercials,
‘I’m Ben Kalman, New York’s honest
car dealer.’ And because you
probably inspired me to go into
this business in the first place.

BEN
Well, Pete, I'm honored to know--

PETE
--But I don't think my
recommendation is going to do any
good. The dealership development
committee is not in the habit of
granting open points to people who
have brought the sort of public
embarrassment to the industry that
you did.

BEN
You get that recommendation sent
up to the committee, I'll worry
about getting them to sign off.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (2)

PETE
Fair enough.

BEN
Good. Let me show you where the
service area will be.

They move off to another section of the lot.

CUT TO:

FOUR WAY INTERSECTION, SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY - LATER

Ben leans against his car, cell phone to his ear. The
mock-up loosely rolled beneath his armpit.

BEN
...It went as well as it could
have, Jordan. Now, remind your
father to speak to the three guys
from Detroit, the younger ones who
weren't there when I had my...

JORDAN (ON PHONE)
Should I lay his clothes out for
him too? Or do you think he can

handle it?

BEN
Okay, alright, Roger that,
Colonel.

JORDAN
Good. Dismissed. Hey, I like
this.

This puts Ben on comfortable terrain.

BEN
Well, we’1l have to put you ina
leather bomber and nothing else.

JORDAN
Now I can’t wait for you to get
back.
A beat.
BEN

Yeah. About this weekend...I’m
sure Allyson doesn’t really want
me around, and--

Total tone change from Jordan.
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:

JORDAN (ON PHONE)

Of course she does. Just like my
father wants to use fifty years of
goodwill and connections, as well
as his position on a board of
directors, to get an admitted
grifter a new dealership, after he
almost tanked an entire company's
reputation.

A beat.

BEN
I’m on my way to the airport.

JORDAN (ON PHONE)
Believe me, she’1l1 feel so much
better with you there to guide her
through the process.

CUT TO:

JFK AIRPORT
Ben and Allyson wait in line to check in.

ALLYSON
Just turn and leave. I can see
how bad you want to.

He looks to her.

ALLYSON
Go to Foxwoods for the weekend.
Or Amagansett’s great off season.
Or wherever. Stay out of sight.
C'mon, it's what you were hoping
for the whole time.

A moment of relief plays on his face.
ALLYSON
Just try not to catch anything
you'll give my mother later. TI
don't want to have to take care of
her.
Ben considers it. Shakes his head.

BEN
No. I don’t lie to your mom.

She almost lets him get away with it. Then can't.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

18.

ALLYSON
I call bullshit, Ben.

BEN
What?

ALLYSON

It means, ask me where I was the
other night for drinks.

BEN
I thought you don't drink.

ALLYSON
I said I don't get drunk. Ask me.

BEN
Okay. Where were you drinking the
other night?

ALLYSON
The bar at the Warwick.

No reaction on Ben's face.

BEN
What night was that?

ALLYSON
The night you hope it wasn't, when
you were in the back booth with
that Eastern European web special?

BEN
Oh. That was Eva. She's my
niece. She was in New York on
business. Why didn't you come
over and say hi?

Allyson spools it out.

ALLYSON
I was on my way to. But that's
when I saw you slip your hand
under her skirt. I thought maybe
you'd dropped something, but then
she started squirming in a way
that made me think, no, he didn't
drop anything...

Allyson gets to the front of the line, hands her ID to

the AGENT.

BEN
...So that's Gin.

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED: (2)

ALLYSON
Huh?
BEN
It means you win the hand.
ALLYSON
I don't play cards.
A beat.
BEN
Well, you didn't sell me out.
Thanks.
ALLYSON

I'd cheat on her if she were my
girlfriend. So have a good
weekend, Ben.

Ben doesn’t move. He just stands there and watches as
Allyson bends down to hand her suitcase to the agent.

ANGLE ON: A pair of BUSINESSMEN checking into first
class appreciate her assets.

ANGLE ON: Ben. He doesn’t like it. Caught, the
Businessmen look away.

BEN
Nope. Still coming with. I'm
gonna do this for you. Not for
your mother. For you. TI know the
school. I know the dean. TI
missed Susan’s college tours, and
I regret it. I was too busy back
then...

The Agent hands Ben back his ticket. They start walking.

ALLYSON
Yeah. Mom says you used to always
be on MSNBC and CNN. That you had
dealerships in every town in
Jersey, Long Island and
Connecticut.

BEN
Slight exaggeration.

ALLYSON
How’d you fuck it up?

BEN
You never googled me?

(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED: (3)

ALLYSON
You want me to believe what's
online? Okay. I was just giving
you a chance to--

BEN
I’m flying up there with you.

She doesn't answer.

BEN

I promise not to ruin your time.
I'll show you around during the
day, walk you to the interview so
I can shake hands with the dean,
smooth it all through for you. At
night, I'll crash at the hotel and
you can do whatever you want. And
this time, I won't tell anyone.

Allyson stops, thinks about it for a second. Meets his
eyes. Something changes between them.

ALLYSON
And you won't treat me like a kid,
right?
BEN
No snowsuit.
ALLYSON
What?
BEN
Forget it. Yeah, you're not a
kid.
ALLYSON
Fine.

A half-smiles comes to her face. And to his. They move
to board the plane.

CUT TO:

BEN'S ALMA MATER

The sun hits a rolling green campus in New England.
FRISBEE GOLFERS, HACKY SACKERS, and DREADLOCKED STONERS
share the quad with some actual SERIOUS-MINDED STUDENTS.

Ben, black framed shades accenting his normal black on
black, and Allyson, walk across the grass.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

21.

BEN
First time stepping back onto this
quad since the day I finished.

ALLYSON
You never even came up for
homecoming? Not even the year
after you graduated?

BEN
Year after I graduated I was
moving six cars a month, on my way
to my own shop. I wasn’t going to
miss a Saturday to spend it with a
bunch of losers reliving glory
they never had. When I was gone,
I was gone.

Ben stops for a moment, looks around. His eyes land on a
BENCH. He looks at it for a second longer then he

should.

ALLYSON
Ben?

BEN
That bench. It...Surprised it’s
still right here.

He shakes the memory off, and points into the distance.

BEN
Admission building is that way.
Some kid was supposed to meet us,
show us the way.

They head off in that direction.

ALLYSON
I thought you were an involved
alumni.

BEN

Alumnus. And that just means I've
written some big checks.

ALLYSON

Then how do you know the Dean and
stuff?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

22.
(2)

BEN
They come to see me. Well, they
used to when they knew they would
walk out of my office with an
endowed chair in the English
department, or the ground breaking
money for an arts center.

ALLYSON
What about now?

BEN
They pay a courtesy call if
they're in town to see someone
else.

ALLYSON
That's nice.

BEN
It's insurance. For when I can
write the checks again.

A FRISBEE is about to hit Ben in the legs. He grabs it
out of the air. Looks to throw it back.

An IRATE STUDENT comes running towards him. Screaming.

IRATE STUDENT
HEY ASSHOLE. Let the big dog
hunt, let the big dog hunt.

Ben doesn't get it.

BEN
Let the?--

IRATE STUDENT
Put the frisbee down. We're
Frolfing. That was my drive. The
hole is over there.

He points to a maple tree 400 yards away.

IRATE STUDENT
You would've cost me a stroke if
you threw it the other way.
Already cost me a few yards by
catching it.

BEN

It almost hit me. I was trying to
help.

(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED: (3)

IRATE STUDENT
Yeah, well thanks but no, grandad.

The Irate Student sticks out his hand for the Frisbee.
Ben almost gives it back. A slow smile comes over his
face.

BEN
No. You called me an asshole.
Now I'm gonna earn it.

Ben takes the Frisbee and whips it in the other
direction. It sails high and gets stuck in a big oak
tree.

The Irate Student gets in Ben's face.

IRATE STUDENT
You motherfucker- -

BEN
--'Ey. There's a woman present.
Short beat.
IRATE STUDENT
Dickwad.

Ben hardly moves. He turns his hips slightly, and lets
his RIGHT FIST go.

It lands in the Irate Student's stomach. The student
doesn't go down though. Just stands there. Then he puts
Ben in a ONE HANDED HEADLOCK. Ben's sunglasses fly off
his face.

Ben tries to free himself. Can’t. The Irate Student
grinds Ben's head under his arm a moment longer.

The Student lets Ben go and pushes him away.

IRATE STUDENT
Like some arthritic punch was
gonna take me out?!

Ben catches his breath, smooths his hair and turns to
Allyson who has been watching with an admixture of horror
and amusement.

BEN
I used to have a pretty good
right.

He turns back to the Irate Student who is now standing
inches from him.

(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED: (4)

IRATE STUDENT
What the fuck were you thinking,
man?

BEN
Well, you know, standard boxing
strategy: go to the body, weaken
you, then go the head.

Ben throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH that catches the Irate
Student flush. This time he falls.

BEN
Seems like a sound strategy.

The Irate Student rears up and takes Ben down to the
ground. They wrestle. Lots of grunting and groaning.
Neither gains a clear edge.

ANGLE ON: Ben is on the bottom. The Irate Student is
about to punch him in the face when a big beefy hand
comes down and lifts him off.

The hand belongs to SGT. JOHN HAVERFORD, Campus Police.
He is an enormous man, about Ben's age, who almost busts
out of his uniform. He speaks with an accent that's
Boston by way of Ireland.

SGT. JOHN
Let’s stop all this.

Ben scrambles to his feet. The Irate Student is silent.
So is Sgt. John.

BEN
Officer. Ben Kalman. Dean
Gitleson is expecting me--

SGT. JOHN
IDs.

Ben and the Irate Student hand ID to Sgt. John.
SGT. JOHN
Someone want to tell me what
happened here?
BEN
Misunderstanding. I'm willing to
forget it if he is.

IRATE STUDENT
Willing.

Sgt. John hands the student’s ID back.

(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED: (5)

SGT. JOHN
Good. Get out of here.

Ben reaches out for his ID. The Sgt. pulls it back.
SGT. JOHN
Not so fast. I want to know what
you're doing on my campus.
Allyson answers.

ALLYSON
Escorting me for my interview.

SGT. JOHN
She your daughter?

BEN
She's not my daughter. She's too
old to be my daughter.
This is not the right answer.
SGT. JOHN
Too young to be anything else that
won't get you arrested.

ALLYSON
He goes out with my mother.

SGT. JOHN
He tell you to say that?

ALLYSON
No.

Sgt. John holds out a hand.

SGT. JOHN
Let me see it.

Allyson takes out her driver's license. Sgt. John stares
at it for a long moment.

SGT. JOHN
Eighteen.

Sgt. John doesn’t like it. But there’s nothing he can
do about it.

He gives the ID back to Allyson, takes one more long look
at Ben’s license.

SGT. JOHN

Kalman. You’re the donor. The
art center and all that.

BEN
I support the school every way I
can.

SGT. JOHN

So you’re also the guy who sold my
cousin in Connecticut on a leased
Jeep that turned out to be
financed. Cost him nine grand on
the back end.

BEN
I had some unscrupulous managers.
I take the blame for not watching
them closer.

SGT. JOHN
You do anything else untoward on
my campus, you’1l1 take more than
the blame.

Sgt. John marches away. Allyson looks at Ben.

ALLYSON
Wow. Smooth.

Ben leans down to pick up his sunglasses. As he comes up

with them,

an earnest looking student, DANIEL CHESTON,

approaches.

CHESTON
Mr. Kalman. I'm Daniel Cheston.
I am the Vice President of the
student senate. Dean Gitleson
sent me to find you. Are you
okay, sir?

Ben takes a deep breath.

BEN
Better than that, Cheston. I'm
great. I hadn't thrown a punch
outside of a gym in years. Whoo!

CHESTON
The dean is ready for you. We
should be getting over there.

CUT TO:
27.

THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS...

EDWARD GITLESON, who is a career fund-raiser in an
academic's clothes. He waits on the front steps of the
imposing admissions building, BRADLETON HALL..

The Dean takes in Ben's appearance.

DEAN GITLESON
Rough morning, Ben?

Ben doesn't give him anything.

BEN
This is Allyson Langer.

After a moment--

DEAN GITLESON
Hello, Allyson.

ALLYSON
Hi.

BEN
She has my highest recommendation,
Edward.

Beat.

DEAN GITLESON
I can hardly imagine a better
endorsement.

BEN
Mmm-hmm.

DEAN GITLESON
Allyson and I are going to go
inside and chat for a while. And
then she'll go on the group tour.
Meanwhile, Mr. Cheston has
volunteered to get you
reacquainted with the grounds.
Thought you might want to see the

Kalman Pavilion. You can pick
Allyson up right here a little
after two.

Allyson and the Dean head inside the hall. Ben and
Cheston watch them go.

BEN
You have anything better to do
than show me around, Cheston?

(CONTINUED)
28.

CONTINUED:
CHESTON
Um...
BEN
Go do it.
Cheston is conflicted.
CHESTON
Don't you want to see the
pavilion?
A beat.
BEN
Because my name’s on the building?
CHESTON
Yeah.
Another beat.
BEN

No.
Ben takes a couple of steps, as if testing his knee.

CHESTON
You’re walking a little funny.
Should we get it checked out at
the school clinic?

BEN
I don’t do doctors. Not anymore.

CHESTON
Do you at least want to get
yourself cleaned up? You can use
my room.
Ben thinks about it for a moment.

BEN
Alright. Thanks. I will.

They turn and walk off into the distance.

Before they go out of frame, ANOTHER FRISBEE comes
sailing very close to Ben.

Ben sticks out a hand, looks like he might catch it, but
then lets the Frisbee FLUTTER by.

CUT TO:
29.

CHESTON'S DORM ROOM

Ben is pulling a T-shirt over his body. Although it is a
little snug, it fits.

BEN
Got a girl, Cheston?

CHESTON
Cheston’s my last name. First
name is Daniel.

BEN
Shouldn’t be. Million Dans.
Anyone can be Dan. You get to be
Cheston. Now about the girl--

CHESTON
Haven't found the right--

BEN
Can't get laid, huh?

CHESTON
I didn't say that.

BEN
Everything about you says it.
Look at this room. If you have
time to put hospital corners on
your bed at college, you're
spending your days the wrong way.

CHESTON
I am making the most of my--

Ben cuts him off.

BEN
You had a high school girlfriend
right? You were both on the...
model UN together or something- -

CHESTON
We were the assistant directors of
the community service outreach--

BEN
And then she went to school and
met some junior who stormed the
admin building or the provost's
house --

CHESTON
--How'd you know he was a--?

BEN
--They’re always juniors. And
you're still stuck trying to
figure out how you lost...Laurie?

CHESTON
Diana.

BEN
Okay. Well lemme tell you
something, Cheston.

Ben points toward the door to Cheston's room.

BEN
Out there exists nothing but
possibility.

CHESTON
But Diana was--

BEN
--Just the same as the other girls
on this campus. Like all young
men you greatly exaggerate the
difference between one young women
and another. G.B. Shaw said that.
Hundred years ago. Still true.

Ben crosses to Cheston's door. Opens it.

BEN'S POV:

STUDENTS walk the dorm's halls. A REDHEAD

and FRIEND laugh.

BEN
Look at her, Cheston. And her.
What's wrong with either of them?

CHESTON
Well, for one, they're not
interested in me.

BEN
Because you don’t know how to
speak to them. Watch.

Cheston is worried about how this will turn out.

CHESTON
No time. We have to pick up
Allyson. We're almost late as it
is.

(CONTINUED)

Ben, not listening, walks out the door into the...

HALLWAY...

Ben approaches the redhead, JOANNE and the friend she was
laughing with, KELLY.

CUT TO:

CHESTON'S DORM ROOM
Cheston watches.

CUT TO:

HALLWAY

CHESTON'S POV: Ben walks over to the young women. He
smiles at them. Says something. They laugh, tell him
something.

Ben turns, begins walking back to Cheston's room.
Surreptitiously gives him a thumbs up sign.

TRACK WITH: BEN INTO...

CHESTON'S DORM ROOM
Ben walks in, shuts the door.

CHESTON
What'd you say?

BEN
Doesn't matter. We're ‘hanging’
with them tonight.

CHESTON
Tonight. I have to--

BEN
You have to go to a party. Where
those women, and plenty of others
just like them are going to be.
Someday you will be my age. And
you will not want to have looked
back on today with regret--

CHESTON
That's why I'm gonna study
tonight - -

(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:

BEN
Nobody regrets taking a night off
from the books to chase some ass.
Especially twenty-one year old
ass.

CHESTON
G.B. Shaw say that too?

CUT TO:

THE QUAD
Ben and Cheston walk at a brisk clip.

BEN
Hold up.

Ben has stopped. He is standing at a series of benches.
He walks to one in particular. Sits down. It's the
bench he stopped at before. From the look on his face
it’s clear the Bench has meaning for him.

BEN
Yep.

CHESTON
I didn’t say anything.

BEN
I know. I’m saying something.
Only saps relive this shit. All
the same, I'm glad this bench is
still here.

Ben takes in the view from the bench. Spreads his arms
wide across its top. Then gets up.

BEN
Onward.

Cheston doesn’t know what to make of it. But he follows
Ben as he moves on.

CUT TO:

BRADLETON HALL

Ben and Cheston arrive to pick up Allyson. They are
late, and the tour has broken up. Allyson stands with
TED, who looks to be about three years older than she is,
with spring-break-ready abs and arms.

(CONTINUED)
33.

CONTINUED:
BEN
Sorry we're late. I tried your
cell--
ALLYSON
No prob. This is Ted. He gave
the tour.
Ted sticks out a hand.
TED
Hey.
BEN
Right.
TED

I told Allyson to come by our
house tonight, we're having a
party. It might give her a good
idea of the social culture we have
here on campus.

Ben already hates the guy, but there is nothing he can
do.

BEN
Sure. If she wants to go. Sure.
Which house is it?

TED
D.U.

This means something to Ben.

BEN
Okay.

ALLYSON
Great. See you later, Ted.

Ted imitates Ben. Thinks Ben won't catch it.

TED
Right.

CUT TO:

A RAUCOUS FRAT PARTY...
...Not out of hand, but active. Ben and Cheston stand by

the keg, filling STUDENTS' cups with beer. Ben's eyes
scope the room. He LOVES what he sees.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

34.

CHESTON
I told you those girls weren't
going to show up here.

BEN
Doesn't matter. Look at that one.
And that one. We are in it now.
Mixing in. We're mixing.

CHESTON
We're standing by a keg. Pouring.
We're pouring.

BEN
And you want to be over...there.
Yeah?

Ben points to a refined looking GIRL in the corner.

CHESTON
No. I uh...

BEN
Your eyes keep moving to her. Go
over, say something.

CHESTON
She uh...

BEN
What?

CHESTON

Not the kind of person you just go
up to at a party. She's serious.
Studious.

BEN
She's here though. She has a
drink in her hand.

CHESTON
Her brother is a member of the
house, so she came by. But nobody
hooks up with her.

BEN
If you're not going to go over
there, you're going to have to
listen to a story. Now, this isa
little raw, but it has the benefit
of being true, so I'll ask for
your indulgence.

(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED: (2)

CHESTON
Granted.

Ben pours himself a Styrofoam stein of amber, pulls from
it, begins.

BEN
This was the first year of
college. I wasn't what you'd call
one of the elite around here.
Certainly wasn't invited to join
this place.

Ben gestures to the Frat House.

BEN
I was one of the ones actually had
a job, help me pay my way--

CHESTON
Me too--

BEN
I know. I saw your’ wardrobe.
Anyway, I wasn't a total innocent,
but I was intimidated by some of
what I saw. Especially the girls.
There was this one girl, sat in
front of me in Freshman
Composition. Name was Jennifer
Angel. Really. And every day I
would stare at the back of her
neck. Sometimes, if she turned to
glance out the window, I'd catch a
glimpse of her face. She was
smart. And real clean looking
too. Cheston my man, I wanted to
get with her in the worst way.
But I couldn't figure it.
Couldn't screw up the courage to
even ask her out. To me, she was
untouchable.

The whole time Cheston is staring at the girl across the
room.

CHESTON
Untouchable.

BEN
One afternoon, I'm tending bar at
some event, and this prick on the
squash team orders a shot of Jack
to help him loosen his hurt back.

CONTINUED: (3)

BEN (CONT'D)
I ask him how he hurt it and he
says: “Jennifer Angel” ."How?", I
ask him. And Cheston, his answer
was like a Joe Frazier left to the
belly. "I was fucking her," he
says, "hard. But she keeps begging
me to do it harder. Harder.
Harder. Finally, I'm nailing her
so fucking hard that the bed
collapses, and I twist my back all
up when we hit the floor."

CHESTON
Jesus.

BEN
"At's right. I actually had to
catch my breath, you know, right
there in front of the guy. My
face turned red hearing about it,
and I'm not exactly the blushing
kind. But you know what? Turned
out to be great. Knowing how she
liked it, that she liked it, freed
me to talk to her. And the next
week, it was my bed that almost
broke. That's what you need to
learn. Some fella has a story like
that on every single one of them.
Might as well be you.

Cheston appears rocked by the story, but he also begins
moving in the direction of the Girl. Ben watches him.

ALLYSON (0.S.)
I thought you were gonna let me do
whatever I wanted by myself.

Allyson stands with Ted. She's all DOLLED UP for the
evening. Ben notices, takes his time answering.

BEN
I was and I am. Close your eyes.
When you open them I'1l be gone.

JAMES J. MCCOUNS...
A local coffee shop/diner.

A few STUDENTS pay their checks and leave.

JIMMY MCCOUNS JR. is wiping down the counter. Jimmy is
roughly the same age as Ben. He hears the door open,
speaks without looking up.

JIMMY
We close in five minutes, so
whatever you order, it's 'to go.'

Ben has entered.

BEN
Was a time I could sit here all
night.

Jimmy still doesn't lift his eyes.

JIMMY
I didn't run the place back then.
My father must have liked you,
some reason.

BEN
If by 'some reason,' you mean
because I saved your ass in every
math class you ever took--

JIMMY
--I remember the ass saving, but I
remember doing most of it, not in
class maybe...

BEN
Well, if there was just one of
them, I could've handled it--

JIMMY
But there were three of 'em if I
recall--

BEN

Yes. There were.
Now Jimmy makes eye contact. A moment between them.

JIMMY
You know I called you when you got
in that trouble a couple years
back. That secretary of yours
wouldn’t put me through.

BEN

Well, she was under orders. I got
the message. I appreciated it.

JIMMY

Didn't expect a call back. Just
wanted you to know.

BEN
I always knew, Jimmy. And I hope
you know--

JIMMY
Of course- -

BEN

No. Let me say it. That wasn't
the only unreturned call. I'm
sorry for it. If there was anyone
from this place I would have
wanted to see, it would have been
you. But when I was gone...

JIMMY
You always said you'd never come
back. Like you always said I'd
never leave.

BEN
You had the business.

JIMMY
Yeah. And now you're here. Is
there something you need?

Ben sits at a stool.

But Jimmy

Any chance I can get a sandwich?
To stay.

very upscale OAK BAR in the Fairmont Copley

They are sitting close to one another. It's clear
they've been drinking for some time. And that Ted is
working it hard.

ANGLE ON: Ben, who stands at the Bar's entrance. He can
see and hear Allyson and Ted. They do not notice him.

BEN'S POV:

TED
...Yeah, and I told the lacrosse
coach that I played attack in
Junior High, was All County attack
in High School, and there was no
way I was playing D for him.

ALLYSON
So you're playing on the front
line now--

TED

--He cut me, but that's not the
point of the story. I stood up
for myself. Went after what I
wanted. And that's what I always
do...

Ted slurps his Jack and Coke.

TED
...I see what I want, and I take a
run at it.

Ben has heard plenty. He walks over to Allyson and Ted,
moves between them and slides the bartender a credit
card.

BEN
For their drinks.

He looks to Ted.

BEN
You regaling her, young man? I
think you are. You look regaled,
Allyson.

Nothing from Ted but a small smile on Allyson's face.
All the encouragement Ben needs.

BEN
Stories of what? Glory? Or its
putative compatriot, noble
failure?

(CONTINUED)

BEN (CONT'D)
I say putative because, and this
is from a man who has failed in
Starburst colors, there is nothing
noble in failure. Do you not
agree, Ted?

Ted doesn't know he's out of his league. Goes with the
College Man approach.

TED
My parents named me after Theodore
Roosevelt. And he said, "It is
not the critic who counts, but the
man who fails while daring
greatly--"

BEN
--Yeah, but that guy didn't
actually fail. It's why we know
the quote. He became President.
See, he bumped up against failure,
found a way to succeed. That's
not what I glean from your
lacrosse story.

Allyson looks to Ted, anticipating some sort of snappy

response.

Gets nothing.

Ben turns to the bartender.

BEN
Scotch for me.

TED
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

Allyson and Ben watch Ted walk away. They Crack Up the

moment he

is out of sight.

BEN
On campus he seemed like one
thing, right? Then you get him
here...

ALLYSON
...Well, he's not from the City,
but he's cute. You going to stop
me from--

BEN

--No. If that's what you want to
do, you do it.

I already told you I wouldn't.

ALLYSON
I don't even care what she thinks.
But for some reason, I care what
you think. What do you think?

BEN
How honest a conversation are you
looking to have here? I can just
drift off to my room now, leave
you with Ted.

ALLYSON
I want your read on the situation.

BEN
He's a waste of time. You'll go
through a lot of trouble for very
little reward.

ALLYSON
You mean, up in the room?

BEN
Do I have to draw it for you? A
guy like that with a girl who
looks like you? He's gonna go
simple. You'll get up there,
begin the proceedings, his face'1l
flush at the sight of it, or, if
he's strong, at the taste, and
he'll be gone. What do you get
from the transaction?

ALLYSON
Transaction?

BEN
That's what it is. Obvious what
he gets. What do you get?

ALLYSON

I need another drink. Here he
comes. What should I do?

Nope. You have all the

She takes a moment, then speaks quickly, before Ted

arrives.

ALLYSON

guardian.

Ted comes back to the bar. Goes for his drink.

BEN
Finish that one, and I think you
should be on your way.

TED
But me and Allyson--

BEN
--Are done for the night. You
made your 'run' at it. Now chalk
it up as another noble failure.

And go.
Ted looks to Allyson, whose face is in her drink. He
downs his drink, departs. Allyson and Ben watch him
leave.
BEN
We should probably call it a night
too.
ALLYSON
Yeah.

TABLE AT THE BAR

Some time

ALLYSON
Is that what the Russian was?

No. She was something worth doing.
It's different.

more relaxed with each moment that passes between them.

Has it always just...been good.
BEN

You mean...
ALLYSON

...You know...when you’re...Ok,
I’ll say it. My first time I was
fourteen.

BEN
Uh huh.

ALLYSON
Well...the thing is...didn't hurt.
But it wasn’t that great either.

Allyson pauses for a moment.

ALLYSON
And. .

Ben makes a hand motion for her to continue.

ALLYSON
It never feels that great really.

BEN
You've never had an--

ALLYSON
Of course I have. But only by
myself. What you said about what
would have happened in the room is
right. I would have ended up
staring at the ceiling all night
while he slept like a log. At
least in New York I could go home.

BEN
It's always like that?

None of the guys I've been with
really know what they're doing, I
guess.

BEN
Can't you tell them what to do?

ALLYSON
How? I don't know what to say.

Ben thinks for a moment. Puts a hand on Allyson's
shoulder. Draws closer to her.

BEN
You hardly have to say anything.
Just take charge, move him how you
want to, take his hands and put
them where they feel right.

Ben drinks, motions the bartender for another, and
another for Allyson.

BEN
And if that doesn’t work. Show
him, you know, yourself. I
promise he’1l never forget you.

ALLYSON
It'll make me seem like a whore.

Drinks arrive. Allyson stares into hers.

BEN
You're thinking about it wrong.
When you're with a guy you like,
don't you want to know what makes
him feel good?

A beat.

ALLYSON

Does my mother know what to do?
BEN

Allyson- -
ALLYSON

No, tell me.
BEN

Sure she does. But...

older. Her body's changed.

There's a thickness as they get
older.

ALLYSON
A thickness. She's stick thin.

BEN
No one over forty is stick thin.
Not really. Trust me.

ALLYSON
But she can get you off--

BEN
Let's not talk about her. We're
all sensual creatures Allyson. We
want pleasure. We want to know
how to give others pleasure. But
we shy away from it. We become
timid. Only that leaves us
wanting. Always. When I'm with a
woman, I make it my business to
solve her. Not out of the
goodness of my heart. But because
it will make her want to solve me.
Do you understand that.

Ben leans into her. She does not back away.
ALLYSON
My God. You must've been an
amazing car salesman.
On Ben:

BEN
I was the best.

CUT TO:

Ben and Allyson enter. They are all over each other...
Ben presses Allyson against the wall.

Allyson laughs.
BEN

She can never find out.

ALLYSON
God no. But she would shit.

Ben laughs too.

BEN
Yeah. She sure would.
ALLYSON
I can picture her face.

Me too. It'd almost be worth it

Allyson makes a shocked face, imitating her mother.

me for breakfast.

ALLYSON
Don't read anything into it. Into
any of it actually. This happened

ALLYSON

Don't worry about anything. I'm

Ben means it...

JORDAN
It's nice of you to say that. I'm
sure you've done quite a bit of
lobbying.

ALLYSON
Really, mom? You think he had to
pull that hard on the strings to
get me in? It's not like my
grades are so bad or anything--

JORDAN
I know how those things are.
You're a suitable enough
candidate, but without Ben...I
can't imagine what you promised
the Dean you'd do if he took her--

BEN
No, he was very impressed, wanted
to make sure he'd be seeing
Allyson in the fall.

JORDAN
We are so lucky to have you in our
lives Right, Al?

Allyson almost chokes on it.

ALLYSON
--Sure, Mom--

JORDAN

I don't tell you often enough. We
are. Lucky.

BEN
Just glad it all worked out.

The waiter comes to clear their plates.

JORDAN
Let's have an after dinner drink.
Allyson you can have a soda. Or,

college girl, a little wine, if

you want.

I'm going out. I'll see you

JORDAN
I'll get that.

She disappears into the other room to take the call. Ben
turns to Allyson. They speak quickly and softly.
Urgently.

BEN

Have you gotten my messages?
ALLYSON

Are you crazy?
BEN

Well, it's hard to talk here, and--

ALLYSON

That's right. We can't talk.
Please, Ben. You know what it was
in Boston. Please. It was a
kick. Really really fun. And so
now I can check two things off my
list, the spite thing and the
daddy thing.

BEN
Daddy thing.

ALLYSON
I didn't even know it was on my
list, or that I had a list. But
now I know. Come on. TI hoped
that was gonna be one more
difference between you and the
guys my age--that you wouldn't "go
simple." That you wouldn't be all
clingy and stuff.

BEN
Not looking to hang all over you.
Just thought we could get some
time together.

ALLYSON
Ben. You need to forget about it.

Then both stop for a moment and listen. Jordan can still
be heard talking on the phone in the other room.

ALLYSON
I appreciate that you took the
time to take me up to school. And
that you spoke to the dean on my
behalf.

ALLYSON (CONT'D)
And I appreciate the advice you
gave me. It's already worked.

BEN
Which advice?

ALLYSON

You taught me to ask for what I
want. The last guy I was with, it
was easy. I just gave him a blow
job first, before anything else.
And then another one. So he could
last when we finally did it. And
then I got on top of him and told
him exactly what to do. It was
awesome. Awesome.

BEN
You're making it up.

ALLYSON
Why would I make it up?

Ben speaks even more quickly, hoping to finish before
Jordan reemerges.

BEN
To put me off you. To put
distance between us. I use that
trick all the time. But only when
I'm afraid I might actually feel
something for someone.

ALLYSON
Well, I'm not. I just did what you
told me to do when you were trying
to get me up to the room.

BEN
I wasn't trying to. It happened.

ALLYSON
I've got to go--

And at top volume...

ALLYSON
Mom, I'm not gonna have a drink.
I have to meet my friends! --

Ben cuts in.

BEN
--Not yet. Allyson. I'ma pretty
cool customer.

BEN (CONT'D)
You know that's what I do most
nights, is find someone to take
home. And I never think about
them again.

ALLYSON
You mean most nights you're not
with her--

BEN

--That's beside the point. But I
can't stop replaying our time
together. And not just in the
room. When we were talking we
were really listening to each
other. Really connecting. I
forgot that you were eighteen.
You forgot that I was--

ALLYSON
No. I didn't.

Jordan enters from the other room. Sees the tension
between them.

JORDAN
Everything alright?
BEN
Of course.
ALLYSON

We slept together, Mom, in Boston.
Jordan can't process.
ALLYSON
Yeah. That's right. We did.
Lucky, huh?
On Ben's face...

SUSAN (PRE-LAP)
Oh, Dad...you didn’t...

SUSAN
What?

BEN
Ask me was it worth it.

SUSAN
No.

BEN
Well, it was.

SUSAN

Are you actually going to gloat
about throwing away--

BEN
Not gloating. Stating something.
Which is, yes. From standing here
now, looking at it, it was worth
it. It was a night and a half,
Suze. The way a eighteen-year old
body responds- -

A voice comes from the darkness.

GARY
No. No way, Ben. You can't keep
dragging her into--

SUSAN
Did we wake you, honey? I'm
sorry--

GARY, Susan's husband, approaches. He's early thirties,
thin, with a slight Chicago accent.

GARY
Forget that. I cannot have you
listening to this crap anymore.
I've told you it's unhealthy, the
shrink told you it's unhealthy--

BEN
Gary, stay out of my relationship
with my daughter.

GARY
My wife.

SUSAN
Well, I'm both.

GARY
Sure, now you are. Cause you're
what he has. But before he blew
up his life, what were you to him?
Really.

SUSAN
Gary!

A beat.

BEN
Well that's a ballsy thing to say,
Garr. Logical. Also, bitter and
small. I'd always hoped Susan
would look to find a big man.

GARY
I take care of her. I'm here for
her. Always.

BEN
You are a hell of a provider.
Good. But me and her, we've got
something else. We bleed the

same.
GARY

Susan, let's go back to bed.
SUSAN

I'll meet you there in a minute.
GARY

But - -
SUSAN

My dad needs to talk to me. I'll
be in soon.

Gary glares at Ben, heads back towards the bedroom.

SUSAN
He's right about a lot of stuff,
you know.

BEN

Guys like Gary are always right
about a lot of stuff. That's why
they have clients who pay them
$450 an hour, and partners who
fast track them and all that crap.
I've never said you didn't pick a
smart husband. He's just not much
of a risk taker.

BEN (CONT'D)
That's why I'm impressed he had
the balls to come at me just now.
Of course, he didn't have the
balls to stand his ground, stay
toe to toe.

SUSAN
You didn't used to talk like this.

BEN
Well, I used to shield you. I
don't bother shielding anyone
anymore. No point to it. Sitting
in a jail cell makes that sort of
thing clear.

SUSAN
You weren't in jail, you paid a
fine, settled.

BEN
I spent a night there. And before
I made my deal I spent plenty of
nights thinking about what it
would be like.

A beat.
SUSAN
We can have this conversation
another time. But you came here
at this late hour for a reason.
A long beat.

Susan goes
back.

BEN
The thing of it is, my
rent...Close as I am to getting
another dealership, and then
rolling ‘em up again, I haven't
gotten it done yet. And as far as
income streams go..

Ben hesitates for a moment. Takes the check and puts it
in his pocket.

BEN
It's only for a short time.
SUSAN
I know.
A long beat.
SUSAN

Look, I'm gonna head back to
sleep. I have an early morning
with Scotty, we're going to the
circus.

BEN
Do you want me to come too?

SUSAN
No. Gary's taking the morning

BEN
Okay. I love you, pumpkin.

SUSAN
Good night dad.

She waits as Ben opens the door and walks out into the
hallway.

FOUR WAY INTERSECTION, SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY
SUPERTITLE: Two Months Later.

He sees Pete Hartofilis standing with another suited man,
GEORGE VINYARATEN. Game face on, Ben strides over to
them.

BEN
Pete, Didn't I tell you this was a
kick ass location!

PETE
Ben. Hi.

Ben gestures to the man next to Pete.

BEN
Ben Kalman.

GEORGE
I know who you are, ‘Ben Kalman,
New York’s honest car dealer.’
It’s a real pleasure.

PETE
Meet George Vinyaraten. It's his
dealership.
GEORGE
Welcome to Vinyaraten Motors.
BEN
Has a certain ring to it.

PETE
Now, Ben, I told you that I loved
this spot.
Ben holds up a hand.
BEN
I'm not here in protest. I need a
job.

You want to come work for me?

BEN
I can sell the shit out of a car.
Always could.

GEORGE
There's no doubt about that.

PETE
George, could you step away for a
moment, leave me with Mr. Kalman.

George extends a hand once more.

GEORGE
A great pleasure.

And he moves off.

PETE
Ben, I'm not even sure corporate
would let you BUY a car from us.
You really crapped the bed on this
one. Understand, I saw the
Paperwork. It was prepared. You
were in. I don't know what you
did, exactly, but now there's no
way...no way.

BEN
Bring me into your house, Pete.
I’1l leave you a real nice parting
gift.
Pete understands the offer being put on the table.

PETE
I can’t do it.

Ben nods, walks away, looking back just in time to see:
A giant sign is being hung atop the dealership. It
reads, VINYARATEN MOTORS.

GINO’S RESTAURANT

Bloomingdales.

Ben and PAUL GERRARD finishing espressos at a table in

Ben puts down his espresso and gestures toward the bar

dad tonight, and is going to play
it for all it’s worth.

GERRARD
FBI should hire you out as a
profiler.

BEN

If they were smart they would.
Double their clearance rate.

He nods in Tan Pants’ direction.

BEN
Not that hard. Look. No wedding
band. But she showed pictures on
her phone to the bartender. The
way he reacted, photos had to be
of her kids. Next, she did one
shot and ordered another. This is
why I was so strong on the lot.
I’d know just what kind of vehicle
to put her in, and I definitely
know what she’s looking for
tonight.

GERRARD
I imagine you do.

Ben waves a WAITER to the table.

GERRARD
Ben. I’ve always enjoyed our
dinners. But I can’t let you out
of here tonight without turning
the conversation in a different
direction.

BEN
Yeah, yeah. We will, we will.

The WAITER comes to Ben’s side.

her I’1l be over there ina

You’ve been a private banking

Ben holds up a hand.

BEN
One sec. Gotta watch it.

ANGLE ON: The Waiter makes the approach. The LADY IN TAN
PANTS takes a moment to get it, but then smiles over at
Ben. He nods back.

BEN
Okay. Now I can listen without
being distracted.

GERRARD
The reason institutions like ours
have private banking clients in
the first place is so that our
highest net worth individuals
don’t have to deal with financial
minutiae in the middle of their
busy days--

BEN
You’re kicking me out of the bank.

ON: Gerrard, caught.

BEN
After all these years. It’s why
you didn’t touch your penne
segreto.

GERRARD
The bank usually sends a letter.
I wanted to tell you in person.

BEN
If I can say this nicely: Fuck
you, Paul. I don’t expect your
sympathy, but I’ve earned your
belief. I’ve done nothing but win
at business since I’m twenty-two
years old.

GERRARD
You had my belief. That’s why,
when you got into your jam, we
continued to keep you and your
family in the private bank.
Continued to steer deals your way.

BEN
I call bullshit.

GERRARD
You call what? What is that?

BEN
It’s what they say. Point is, you
pretend you stick by clients
through ‘difficult times,’ but
you’re just looking for the right
moment to get the deficit off the
books.

GERRARD
We are not the ones who changed.
You used to wake up at three in
the morning to review business
plans and sales reports. Now
you’re finding your way home
through a haze of women and booze--

BEN
You never objected to the women
when some were falling off into
your lap.

GERRARD
They were an amusement six years
ago. Which was fine. Now you
can’t even get through a meal
without jumping up--

BEN
I was just yanking you with the
stuff about the girl at the bar.
I know all that because she’s a
mother from Scotty’s class. Carol
Soloman. I’m not really rolling
her out of here. Just saying hi.

GERRARD
Yanking me?--

A hint of humility comes into Ben’s voice.

BEN
C’mon, Paul, give me a year to get
it going again. This cripples me.
I need the credibility the bank
gives me, the access, the backing--

GERRARD
We have to do this. It’s
finished, Ben.

Ben sees the MAITRE-D. Yells out to him.
BEN
Jason. Check over here! Right
away .

The Maitre-D comes to the table with the check, leans in
close so as not to embarrass Ben.

MAITRE-D
About your house account...

Ben hands the check across the table to Gerrard.
BEN
He’1l pay it. Least he can
fucking do.

Gerrard hesitates for a moment, then reaches into his
pocket.

GERRARD

I really do wish you all the best.
BEN

Sure. Because what does that cost

you?

Ben stands, pushing his chair into the table harder than
necessary, and walks toward the door of the restaurant.

BEN’S BEDROOM

Light comes in around the edges of Ben’s blackout shades.
He slowly opens his eyes. Next to him, Carol Soloman,

CAROL
Baby Aspirin, huh? Have you had
an incident, or are you just
cautious?

BEN
I seem cautious to you?

CAROL
Not the first word I'd use.

BEN
I don’t actually know for sure.
Guy saw something on an EKG once.
Wanted to run some tests.

CAROL
What did they see?

BEN
Never went for ‘em.

CAROL
I couldn’t live like that. And if
you were my husband- -

BEN
Well, thank God for all
involved...

She slaps him, mostly playfully.

BEN
What do I want to know for? I
just want do the things I want to
do, and only the things I want to
do, until it happens. Whatever it
is going to be.

CAROL
You seem to have infected me with
a little of that spirit. Shit.
How did I end up here with the
grandfather of my son’s friend?

BEN
Because you’re in your late
thirties, Carol. In your twenties
you’d have held out for a
dissatisfied father of your son’s
friend.

She slaps at him again. This time a bit less playfully.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

CAROL
Who talks like that?

BEN
Everyone. But most people only
say this shit to themselves. I
let it fly.

CAROL
And you think that’s a good thing?

BEN
What I think is: conversation’s
not our long suit. Let’s just get
dressed.

CAROL
Fine with me.

She begins getting out of the bed

BEN
And, although it shouldn’t need to
be voiced, let’s not tell Susan
about this.

CAROL
Don’t worry, that’s the last thing
I want.

BEN
Hey, can you get a look at that
clock?

CAROL
The clock.

BEN

The one in the drawer on your
side. I threw it in there last
night, so it wouldn’t wake us up
when the alarm went off.

As she’s going to the drawer.

CAROL
Isn’t that the idea?

Ben scrambles out of bed.

OUTSIDE OF ESPN ZONE

Susan stands with Scotty and Gary on the sidewalk in
front of the Times Square arcade and entertainment
complex. They are saying goodbye to a few MOTHERS and
KIDS of Scotty’s age.

Ben comes half-jogging up to them as the last of the Moms
and Kids leave.

BEN
Happy Birthday, Kiddo.

Ben pulls Scotty into a hug. Susan shakes her head at
Ben. Gary can barely look at him.

As Ben and Scotty separate...

SCOTTY
You missed the party, Captain Ben.

Gary bumps an eyebrow at Susan “Captain Ben?” Susan
shrugs, “tell ya later.”

BEN
And I’m sorry about that. I had a
last minute business meeting. But
I’m here now!

SCOTTY
Yeah, but the party’s over. You
didn’t get to sing happy birthday.
You didn’t get any cake.

Ben ignores him. Speaks to Scotty.
BEN

So we’1l have our own after-party.
And we’1l make it even better than

this party.
SCOTTY
We will?
BEN
Definitely.
He turns to Susan.
BEN
Are you heading back to the

apartment?

Susan doesn’t respond, she looks to Gary, who has hailed
a cab.

GARY
C’mon Scotty, Susan, let’s go.

Susan grabs a HUGE BAG of gifts, puts it in the front
seat of the taxi. Then she hustles Scotty into the back
seat, in between Gary and her.

SCOTTY
Can he come over? Please, mom!

Susan shuts the door, shouts out the window.

SUSAN
There’s no room in the cab.

BEN
We can squeeze. Move the presents
to the trunk.

Susan speaks softly enough that Scotty can’t hear, but
her anger still comes through.

SUSAN
If you want to come, get yourself
there. And you better have a
present and a cake with you too.

And the car drives off, leaving Ben standing there with
his hands in his pockets. He turns to head towards the
subway.

CUT TO:

SUSAN'S KITCHEN

Ben, Scotty and Susan stand around a Carvel cake with
nine candles in it. Ben lights the candles and he and
Susan begin to sing. Gary enters the room at the sound
of the singing and joins in for his son.

As soon as Happy Birthday ends, Gary walks back out.

Ben hands Scotty a knife and helps him cut the first
piece.

SUSAN
We’re going to save that for after
dinner.

SCOTTY

But it’s my cake.

SUSAN
You already had cake today.

BEN
It’s his birthday. Let him have a
bite at least, so I can watch.

Ben cuts off a small bite for Scotty, puts it in his
grandson’s mouth. Scotty makes a big show of enjoying
himself. Susan can’t help letting a smile come.

CUT TO:

SCOTTY’S ROOM

Susan stands at the doorway watching Ben and Scotty. The
two of them sit right next to each other on the floor of
Scotty’s room, playing Madden on PS3.

SUSAN
This is the last quarter, guys.
SCOTTY
We just started this game. No

How many have you already played?

SCOTTY
This is the last game of the
regular season. But we’re only
playing three minute quarters so
we’1ll be done really soon.

BEN

enthusiasm)
Really soon.

SUSAN
Half-hour more and that’s it you
two. We have to go to your other
grandparent’s house.

SCOTTY
But I want to stay with Grandpa.
He said I could call him that in
private.

SUSAN
Well, daddy’s parents are
expecting us, so we have to go.

Ben makes some moves with his controller.

BEN
Touchdown!

SCOTTY
Hey, no fair. I was talking to my
mom.

BEN

Snooze you lose young man.

And they are back to the game. Susan watches a moment
more then shuts the door.

Susan and Ben stand by the elevator doors.

BEN
I’m glad we have a minute alone.
I need to ask you for another
small loan.

SUSAN
You are out of your mind. Gary’s
right. You’ve actually lost it.

BEN
What?

SUSAN
I’m not giving you more money.
Especially after today’s
performance.

The elevator comes. Ben lets it go without him.

BEN
You telling me Scotty didn’t have
a great time?

SUSAN
No. He has a better time with you
than anyone. That’s the problem.
He thinks you’re magic.

BEN
That’s how he should think of his
grandfather.

SUSAN

No. He should think of his
grandfather as consistent,
reliable.

BEN
Consistent is boring. His other
grandparents are consistent and he
doesn’t even want to go to their
house.

SUSAN
But when he needs them, he knows
that they’11 come running. And it
makes him feel safe.

BEN
That’s an illusion. You know
that. No one can really protect
anyone. You saw what happened to
me. All those so-called important
pals I had lined up over the years
went running for the hills--

SUSAN
I’m not going to go back and forth
with you about this. You missed
his party. He had a long face on
the whole time, kept looking at
the elevator every time it opened,
thinking that you were going to
come walking out. Mom and I
must’ve tried your cell six times--

BEN
I didn’t mean to miss the party.
My alarm didn’t go off and--

SUSAN
It’s not what you mean to do.
It’s what you do. And you know
whose fault it really is? Mine.
I let him have these hopes. Just
like I did when I was his age.
But I won’t anymore. If you let
him down again, that’s it. I
can’t put him in a position to get
hurt. Not when you can totally
prevent it from happening.

BEN
What are you gonna do, cut me off
from seeing my own grandson? I
love that little boy.

SUSAN
It’s not fair for you to dart in
and out at your own whim to the
extent that he can’t even have fun
at his own birthday party. Either
be in his life or don’t.

Susan pushes the elevator button and neither one says
another word.

The elevator arrives. Ben slowly gets in.

CUT TO:

NANCY’S APARTMENT...
The apartment is huge, but has a warm, classic style.

Nancy hands Ben a glass of red wine, sits across from
him.

NANCY
It’s good for the heart.
Antioxidants.

Ben moves the wine to the side.

BEN
Important as the future health of
my circulatory system is, Nance,
it’s not at the top of my list at
the moment. The truth is: I
can’t give you anymore checks.
Not for a while.

Nancy takes it in.

NANCY
Hmm-hm.

BEN
And...And I need to ask you to
float me some cash.

NANCY
Benny, I’d never let you starve.

BEN
Which is thoughtful considering--

NANCY
--But I can’t support you--

BEN
--How many meals I bought you over
the years, how much cash went
from me to you--

NANCY
Stop. You’re not one of those
guys. You didn’t even make me
take you to court.

Ben opens his palms.

BEN
You put in the years. What was I
gonna do?

Ben gets up, wine in hand, goes to the window and looks
out over New York.

BEN
What am I supposed to do?

NANCY
What people do. What I did. Move
forward. You’re not who you were.
I’m not either--never thought I’d
sell real estate. Turns out I’m
good at it. And I like it. And I
like my wine class and playing
bridge with my friends on
Wednesdays.

Ben gestures out the window.

BEN
And you still have the best view
in the city...

NANCY

That’s why I never sold it.
Ben glances back at her.

NANCY
Or did you think I was holding
vigil that some day you’d return,
and I wanted everything to be the
same for our reunion.

BEN
You made it pretty clear you
weren’t when you shacked up with
Mark, the orthodontist --

NANCY
He’s a financial--

He had the affect of an
orthodontist.

Not a chair. Or a ccouch. Not
even a cushion.

NANCY
Couch still comfortable?

BEN
Most comfortable couch I’ve ever
sat on.

NANCY
Yeah, I don’t make it a habit to
change what works. That’s your
move.

No answer from Ben for a long moment.

BEN
Is that what you think? That it
was working?

NANCY
For a long time. Until you
decided that nothing was working
for you.

BEN
I didn’t decide. Things
happened. Events took place.

NANCY
You’ve never been the kind of
person “things happen” to. You
make things happen. Always have.
You built your business yourself,
destroyed it yourself. Same with
our marriage. You can blame
anyone you want: me for having the
audacity to get older each year,
your general managers for
“engaging in practices” you didn’t
know about, the D.A.’s office for
being politically motivated, but
until you figure out how you
actually got in this position,
you’11 never find your way out of
it.

Ben almost speaks to it. Almost unburdens. Instead, he
just takes a sip of the wine, looks back over the city.

CUT TO:
75.

BEN'S APARTMENT

Ben, in his bathrobe, sits on his couch. He is unshaven.
PACKING BOXES are scattered across the floor. His buzzer
rings.

CUT TO:

BEN'S NEW APARTMENT

Ben, in his bathrobe, sits on his couch, watching
television.

This apartment, a studio with a bed in the corner, is
much smaller than the old one.

His cell phone rings. He doesn't answer it. His land
line rings. He doesn't answer that one either.

And then a knock on his front door. He considers his
options then gets up.

Standing at the door is TODD THE BUILDING MANAGER, cut in
the Kevin Smith mold, plenty of attitude. Ben does not
ask him in.

TODD
Mr. Kalman.

BEN
Todd.

TODD

Mr. Kalman, you’re three weeks
late and it’s only your second
month. When I let you move in
here with questionable financials
you convinced me I could trust
you.

BEN
You can.

TODD
I need that check or I have to
start removal proceedings.

BEN
By tomorrow afternoon. My own
sense of honor won’t let me
default on--

Ben is cut off by a VOICE coming from down the hall. We
recognize it as Susan’s before we see her.

(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:

SUSAN

Carol Soloman? You had to fuck a
friend of mine, someone I see at
school everyday? Then mock her in
the morning, never call her, never
even return her calls. You had to
put me in that position? You’re
priceless, Dad.

BEN
Ho-ho-hold on--

By now Susan is standing at the door with Ben and Todd,
who does not make it more comfortable by leaving.

SUSAN
Scotty has a play date at Sean’s
house, that’s Carol’s son, and
when I get there to pick him up,
she sits me down in their kitchen
and tells me the story. Says her
nanny is going to bring Sean to
the next playdate because it’s too
awkward otherwise.

BEN
What’d she expect, that I’d pin
her, take her to the prom? Tell
her to grow up.

SUSAN
It’s not about what she expects.
It’s about what I expect.

BEN
You expect me to be chaste? To
never have sex again now that your
mother and I are divorced.

SUSAN
No. I expect you not to fuck my
friends.
Ben turns to Todd.
BEN

Do you think you could let us--
Todd, enjoying it, takes his time answering.
TODD
By tomorrow. Certified or
cashier’s. Or you’re gone.

Todd leaves, smirking.

BEN
Do you want to come inside,
Pumpkin? - -

SUSAN

No. Was she really your only
option? Couldn’t you have just
called a hooker if you needed it
that bad?

BEN
I can’t afford to anymore. The
good ones cost too much.

Susan laughs, but as a reflex, not with any joy.

BEN
You used to love my stories.

SUSAN
I liked that you’d treat me as
your friend.

BEN
I still do.

SUSAN
But now we’re both old enough to
know you shouldn’t.

Ben lets this settle for a second. Then meets her eyes.

A beat.

BEN
You’re not a kid anymore. It’s
time to realize you can’t change
your daddy.

SUSAN
I’m still your child. And it’s
time you realize you’re still my
father.

BEN
So what do you want me to do?

SUSAN
I want you to get help. See
someone. Maybe try medication.
Something. Just until you get
your balance back.

BEN
No. You know I’m not doing that.

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED: (3)
SUSAN
Well, then, if you really won’t
help yourself, I need you to leave
me, my friends, my family alone.

BEN
I’m sorry to hear that.

SUSAN
But not sorry enough to do
something about it.
A long beat.
SUSAN
You’re actually going to let us
walk out of your life?

BEN
You’re making the choice. Not me.

Susan hesitates for a moment.
SUSAN
Fine. If that’s the way you need
to hear it. I am making it. Stay
away from us.
She turns and walks away.
On Ben...

CUT TO:

A NEW ENGLAND NEIGHBORHOOD

It’s late at night. No traffic on the tree-lined street.
A SEDAN rolls to a stop and parks in front of a...
MODEST HOUSE

Ben, now cleaned up a bit, gets out of the sedan, walks
up the driveway to the front porch.

He hesitates for a moment at the front door. Knocks.
Takes a beat. Looks through the pane of glass. Takes
another beat. Rings the bell. Steps back as he hears
footsteps.

JIMMY (0.S.)
Yeah?

(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:

BEN
It’s Ben. Ben.

Door opens. Jimmy is in his robe, clearly just awakened.
He steps aside and gestures Ben into the house.

JIMMY
Anne’s still sleeping so...

BEN
Of course.

Ben steps lightly as he enters.
CUT TO:

JIMMY’S KITCHEN

Jimmy takes two beers out of the fridge, hands one to
Ben.

BEN
Thanks. Had to get out of the
city. Didn’t even know where I
wanted to go. I just put it in
drive. Stopped here. I know you
weren’t expecting me.

JIMMY
We're friends, right?

Ben takes a pull on his beer.

BEN
Thanks.

A beat.
JIMMY
I gotta serve breakfast in the
morning, so...

BEN
Of course.

Jimmy points to a room at the other end of the house.
JIMMY
Blankets are in the playroom. A
Pillow too. Use that couch.

Ben nods and Jimmy begins walking down the hall toward
his bedroom.

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:

BEN
Hey, Jimmy...

Jimmy turns back. Ben hesitates for a long moment. This
isn’t easy.

BEN
How you fixed for help. At the
deli. .?

JIMMY
Really?

Ben shrugs.

CUT TO:

JAMES J. MCCOUN’S

Ben, wearing an apron, fits a pound of Roast Beef into
the meat slicer.

BEN
Jimmy, come help me set the
thickness on this thing.

Jimmy comes over, sets the dial for him.

BEN
Hey, thanks for the job.

JIMMY
I’ve needed someone since the kid
quit last semester. Besides--

BEN
I know. Friends.

Ben turns on the machine. Before Jimmy walks away they
both notice a KNOCKOUT come through the front door.

BEN
How the hell do you get your work
done with all these distractions
here.

JIMMY
I look for a second and then I go
back to what I gotta do.

BEN

Uh huh. And you’ve been married
how long?

(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:

JIMMY
Twenty-four years this April.

BEN
And all that time, you’ve never
had so much as a picnic with any
of these girls?

JIMMY
I’m married to Anne.

BEN
Yeah I know. I just said that.
But not once? Not once?

JIMMY
Four times. Early eighties. But
that was before I was married.

BEN
And nothing since then?

JIMMY

It’s not exactly like they’re
begging me for it. These girls
take economics. Micro and macro.
They know what fifty-eight K a
year gets ya. They’re looking to
hook up with guys their own age,
or rich assholes. No offence.

BEN
How could that offend me?

Jimmy grabs a hero roll, slices it in half, makes a sub
as he talks.

JIMMY
You want to know the secret, why
it don’t bother me.

BEN
Yeah.

JIMMY
Truth, it wasn’t easy in the
beginning. First couple years
after I took over for my dad, --
honest, I'd dream about these
girls all night.

Ben takes the sliced roast beef out of the machine, puts

it on a mayo’d piece of white bread, adds lettuce, tomato
and the second piece of bread.

(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED: (2)

JIMMY
But then, as they started coming
back after they graduated, to
homecomings and ball games, and
sat at the same tables, and
ordered the same food, I saw:
they don’t stay like this. None
of ‘em. They put on years,
pounds, lines, everything. And I
got one like that at home. And I
can talk to her. I know her.
I'll always know her.

BEN
And now you never look at these
girls and want to fuck ‘em.

JIMMY
No. I want to fuck all of them for
a minute. Some for a month. But
I can let it go.

BEN
Not me. I don’t know how I didn’t
get up here sooner. Everywhere my
eyes land I see soft targets.
Some of these girls are real
special, James.

JIMMY
Ah, in the end, it’s all the same.
It’s supposed to be young men who
confuse the differences between
young women- -

BEN
Yeah, Shaw. I use it to mean
something different sometimes.

Ben plates the roast been sandwich and walks it around
the counter.

As he moves into the dining area, the front door opens
and Allyson enters with a group of GIRLFRIENDS.

She does not see Ben at first, and works her way to a
table in the rear of the diner.

Ben tries to keep his back to her as he delivers the
sandwich.

On his way back behind the counter though, they make eye

contact. Allyson, playing it as cool as she can in front
of her new Friends, gets up from her seat.

(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED: (3)

ALLYSON
Ben. This is weird, Ben.
BEN
I didn’t chase you up here.
A beat.
ALLYSON
I don't even know what to say.
I...
BEN

Nothing you have to say.

ALLYSON
This is really weird.

Now the Girls at Allyson’s table are watching the
conversation. A few other tables are paying attention
too.

BEN
Let’s go out front for a sec.

CUT TO:

SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF JAMES J. MCCOUN’S

Ben and Allyson walk out of the restaurant. Light snow
falls.

BEN
I needed to get out of the city.
Jimmy gave me a job. That’s the
reason I came up.

ALLYSON
This is the best job you could
get.

BEN
It’s a job.

ALLYSON

But you had to have other options.
BEN

Your mother was very thorough in

eradicating them.

Allyson takes this in.

(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:

ALLYSON
You must be so mad at me.

BEN
I’m not, actually. You had an
opening, took it. Got a hard,
clean shot in on your mom. Boxing
glove can’t get mad at the fist.

ALLYSON
So you're alright...

BEN
It is what it is.

There’s really nothing more to say. They stand for a
moment longer, then Allyson turns toward the restaurant.
Just before she opens the door...

ALLYSON
I didn't do it to get at her. I
did it because I wanted to.

Almost a smile from Ben.

BEN
Me too.

Allyson, and then Ben, walks back inside.

DISSOLVE TO:

JAMES J. MCCOUN’S

It’s another day. Dinner crowd is thinning out. Ben
works the counter.

The front door opens and Cheston enters. He’s with an
attractive girl, MAUREEN. The two of them, in winter
clothes lightly dusted with snow, take seats at the
counter.

Ben sees them.

BEN
Cheston.

CHESTON
Mr. Kalman. Great to see you. I
had heard you were here. I wanted
to give this back to you.

Cheston hands Ben the shirt that got messed up fighting
over the frisbee.

(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:

BEN
You even washed it. Thanks.

CHESTON
De nada.

This is obviously an inside joke to Maureen. She repeats
it...

MAUREEN
De nada...

And the two of them laugh. Ben likes it.

BEN
You seem to be doing just fine,
young man.

CHESTON

Well, I told you I was a good
student. This is Maureen.

BEN
Hi, Maureen. What can I get you?

MAUREEN
Black and White shake, please.

BEN
On its way.

Cheston holds up two fingers.

CHESTON
Dos.
Again, laughs.
MAUREEN
Dos.
BEN

And these are on the house.

CHESTON
Thanks. Hey, we’re having a
little house party Thursday night.
You want to come by?

BEN

You, having a party? Aren’t there
classes the next day?

(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED: (2)
CHESTON
So I sleep late and miss a class.
Is that really such a big deal?
BEN
Not if you’re sleeping late with
Maureen it’s not. I’d love to
come to the party. Gracias por la
invitacion.
Not much laughter.
Ben turns on the blender.

CUT TO

BEN...

...Walking along the street outside James J. McCouns.

The snow has picked up now. He wears a long black woolen
coat. STUDENTS and LOCALS move along the street too, but
in small clusters, together, talking and laughing.

Ben watches it all as he walks.

CUT TO:

MODEST HOUSE - PLAYROOM

Ben gets ready for bed. Takes his shirt off, his pants.
Sits down. Breaths out.

His cell phone rings. He looks at the number, almost
doesn’t answer.

BEN (INTO PHONE)
Yeah.

INTERCUT WITH:

Jordan is in the back seat of a chauffeur driven Town Car
parked outside the Whitney.

JORDAN
I’m going to speak quickly and
clearly so that we don’t
misunderstand one another,
Benjamin.

BEN
That would be fine.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

The phone
his couch.

JORDAN
It has been explained to me that
you are on Allyson’s campus.

BEN
I’m at the school, yes. I got a
job up here.

JORDAN

You are to leave that campus
tomorrow. I will not have my
daughter’s environment threatened.
This is her college experience. I
want her to remember it fondly.

BEN
Did she complain to you?

JORDAN
That’s an irrelevant question.

BEN
Well I’ve never approached her,
never tried to--

JORDAN
You’re mistaking this for a
conversation. I don’t want to have
to tell her father about
everything that’s transpired. But
I will. And, as you know, he has
a wide ranging group of contacts.
And a far reach.

BEN
So you’re asking me to come back
to the city--

JORDAN

I for one, don’t care where you
are. As long as you’re not there.
Tomorrow, Ben. Get going. Or
this file moves from my desk to
Allyson’s father’s.

goes silent. Ben turns it off, lies down on

CUT TO:
88.

CHESTON’S HOUSE

Belle and Sebastian’s Dear Catastrophe Waitress plays on
an Ipod Hi-Fi set up on the lid of an old vinyl
turntable.

Cheston’s ROOMMATES, MAUREEN and a good sized group of
other STUDENTS are hanging out talking over the music.
Drinks, cigarettes, a Bong.

Cheston and Ben, each with a bottle of beer in hand, lean
in close to one another on Cheston’s couch.

At various points during the conversation, Ben makes eye
contact with a TALL GIRL who has BLONDE STREAKS in her
hair.

BEN
...SO now I’m thinking that maybe
Allyson wasn’t trying to get a
rise out of her mother so much as
she was trying to get my attention
through her mother. You see what
I mean?

CHESTON
Trying to understand behavior
through Jungian archetypes is a
slippery slope, Ben...

Ben realizes something.

BEN
You were sneaking in some studying
this afternoon weren’t you?

CHESTON
I still have to do well. I told
her I was crashing out after a
morning wake and bake.

BEN
Well played. But back to Allyson.
See, I just know there was a
message being sent.

Cheston closes his eyes for a moment.
CHESTON
Did you get, like, caught up in
her or something.
BEN
I might have.

(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:

CHESTON
But your counsel to me was to
remember that--

BEN
I say a whole bunch of shit, kid.
Some of it’s even true.

Ben starts moving his head to the Belle and Sebastian.

BEN
Is this new? It’s great.

CHESTON
No. It’s old. Really old. I was
in ninth grade when it came out, I
think.

BEN
Good though. What is it?

CHESTON
Belle and Sebastian. Scottish
seven-piece.

Ben takes a moment, scopes the whole scene Cheston’s
working.

BEN
Nicely done, young man, nicely
done...

And then he gestures toward Maureen, who is lounging
across the room.

BEN
...All around.

CHESTON
Well, being a Junior is nothing
like being a Sophomore.

BEN
That’s for sure. But being a
sophomore is better than being a
senior. Cause it’s all in front
of you.

Belle and Sebastian fades out and the IPOD shuffles to
Hoodrat Friend by The Hold Steady. Ben still keeps the
time with his head.

He downs his drink, gets up, and goes over to the Tall
Girl with Blonde Streaks.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

BEN
Lumberjack, right?

TALL GIRL
What?

BEN

That’s your Sunday morning
breakfast. The lumberjack
special. Two two and two. Cakes,
eggs, bacon.

TALL GIRL
You’re the guy who works at
McCouns. I kept trying to figure
out who you were.

Ben tries to find his in.

BEN
I’m the hash slinger.
TALL GIRL
Okay.
BEN

I noticed the breakfast for two
reasons. First because you’ve got
the same hair Bancroft had in Mrs.
Robinson. And she always drove me
nuts.

No real sign of encouragement, or its opposite.

BEN
And, I loved the fact that you had
the guts to just eat, you know,
fuck what people think, you’re
gonna be you, right?

TALL GIRL
Wow. That’s way more thought than
I put into it. I just like
pancakes.

BEN
Uh huh. Cool.

Music keeps playing.

BEN
Great band, right.

TALL GIRL
They’re my favorite.

(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED: (3)

BEN
I remember when it first came out.
Like around ‘95. I said to
myself, Belle and Sebastian,
they’re the future. And I
listened to it that whole year.

TALL GIRL
Well, this is The Hold Steady
playing now.

BEN
Oh.

TALL GIRL
Yeah. Good talking to you. I’11
um...I’11 see you at McCouns.

She walks to the other side of the party, joins a couple
of her Friends, who try not to look over at Ben.

Ben heads for the cooler to get another drink. Maureen
is getting a refill too. Ben falls into a much more
natural rhythm with her.

BEN
Cheston’s terrific, isn’t he?
MAUREEN
No, he’s superific. He thinks
you’re some kind of arch Doctor
Phil.
BEN

Doctor Phil. No way. I’m much
more cutting edge than that. He’s
mainstream. And a bozo. I’m like
Bill Clinton.

MAUREEN
What is it with men your age and
Bill Clinton?

BEN
Men my age!

Ben really gets rolling now. The preceding failure a
memory. He begins walking to a quiet corner. Maureen
follows.

BEN
It’s just a good analogy. Like
him, I’m strong of jaw and big of
heart.

BEN (CONT'D)
And although no longer on the
front lines, a statesman, who can
tell you just what to say and do
to get the job done.

She laughs, warmly.

MAUREEN
Is that what you told Cheston?
How to get it done? He’s pretty
closed mouthed about the
specifics.

BEN
Well I never reveal confidences.
I want you to know that too. I’d
never tell him anything you said
either. Or anything I saw. Or
anything that happened.

MAUREEN
What’s going to happen, Ben?

Ben closes the distance between them a bit.

BEN
That’s not actually the question
of the moment.

MAUREEN
No?

BEN
The question of the moment is
this: are you getting enough from
the transaction?

MAUREEN
The transaction?

BEN
Yeah. Between the two of you.
Look, you have jokes, that Spanish
gimmick or whatever it is, you can
wear each other’s clothes, study
together, but, how can he be
getting it done for you where it
matters? It’s obvious that you
get it done for him. But what do
you get from the transaction.

She leans in to him. Speaks as quietly as she can, but

with fire.

(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED: (5)

MAUREEN
You are a scumbag. Way worse than
Clinton too. He actually tried to
do some good. Shit. Cheston
thinks you care about him.

BEN
I do. This has absolutely nothing
to do with him. He’d never find
out. Never. Listen, I’m not
asking you to stop being with him.
I think it’s a nice little thing
for both of you. But what I’m
talking about is something else.
And the very fact that you’re
still standing in with me here,
tells me that you know it too.

MAUREEN
I’m still standing here because
I’m deciding whether to throw this
drink in your face or not. But I
don’t want Cheston to know what
you tried to do. So instead, I’1l
just ask you to walk away.

BEN
Hey, nothing personal.

He turns to go. She grabs him by the shoulder.

MAUREEN
That’s it, actually. Since you
asked. That’s what I get.
Something personal. Besides
‘getting it done’ upstairs, which
he does, Cheston and I reach each
other. He’s tender. Funny.
Sweet. Smart. He’s a million
things that you aren’t.

BEN
I was once. It doesn’t last,
honey.

And Ben heads for the door. On his way he grabs another
beer, drinks it down in a gulp.

THE QUAD/SUSAN’S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

Ben careens across the quad, obviously starched. He
walks past the Bench. The one he stopped at before. He
lingers. Runs his hand across the top of the bench.
Takes out his cell phone.

GARY
Hello.

BEN
I want to speak to my grandson.

GARY
He’s been asleep for...six hours.
Jesus, do you know what time it

BEN
Late. I’m sure it’s late. Wake
him up. He’1l want to talk to me.

Ben hears the sound of the phone being passed across the

bed.

SUSAN
Dad. You can’t do this. You're
drunk.

BEN

I need to talk to him. I have
things to tell him. Important
things. Rules. What to do. What
not to do. I can teach him. Who
else is going to?

SUSAN
No.

BEN
This is important stuff. I don’t
want him to fuck it all up. I’m
not gonna be around forever and
when I’m gone who will he have to
show him?

SUSAN
This is hard for me. But I’m
hanging up, dad.

BEN
Okay, okay. I called past his
bedtime. I shouldn’t have. But
I’m sitting here on the Bench, you
know, where I met your mother. I
have to walk past this fucking
bench three times every day. I
try not to look at it. But I
always do. We sat here, talked
from three in the afternoon until
the sun came up again.

How can I be on this bench and not

someone. To Scotty.

SUSAN
I’m sorry--

BEN
Tomorrow. I’11 call back in the
morning.

SUSAN

He won’t be available then either.
He thinks you’re on a long trip
where there are no phones. Which
you are.

Ben puts the phone back in his pocket.

CUT TO:

MODEST NEIGHBORHOOD
Ben walks toward Jimmy’s house.

Five doors down from Jimmy’s place, Ben passes a parked
LINCOLN TOWN CAR. He doesn’t notice that...

A man, NASCARELLA, gets out of the Lincoln and begins
following him.

Nascarella comes up behind Ben and PUNCHES him in the
kidney.

Ben goes straight down.
Nascarella stands over him.
NASCARELLA
I’m gonna tell you a few things.
Then I’m gonna do a few things.
First, you’re not being robbed.
Ben, breathing heavy, tries to get up on hands and feet.

NASCARELLA
Just stay there.

Ben rolls over to a sitting position.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

96.

NASCARELLA
Second, my name is Nascarella.
I’m giving you my particulars, so
you understand that you can forget
going to the cops about this. I
had thirty years in and left with
a gold shield. Plus I squared
things with the campus officer
when he was giving me a copy of a
report he wrote up. Seems you’ve
thrown the first punch before.
Just like tonight.

BEN
The fuck do you want? I paid all
my Vegas debts. AC too.

NASCARELLA

Good. Nothing to do with me. I
run security for Allyson Langer’s
father. And the third thing I
gotta tell you is: leave. As
soon as you can. You were told
once. You ignored it. Are you
gonna ignore me?

Ben meets Nascarella’s eyes.

BEN
No. I’m not. I’11 go.

NASCARELLA
You mean that? Really? That’s a
promise?

BEN

Yes. I’11 leave first thing in
the morning.

NASCARELLA
Not sure you’1l1 be able to get on
your way that quickly.

BEN
What?

NASCARELLA
You can get up now.

Ben gets himself to his feet. The moment he does,
Nascarella is on him. Even if he wasn’t drunk, Ben
couldn’t do much against the man.

(CONTINUED)
97.
CONTINUED: (2)

Nascarella throws punches like a technician. He attacks
the ribs, stomach, kidneys and drops Ben back down to the
concrete with a shot to the face.
NASCARELLA

Don’t ignore me. No broad is

worth it.
Nascarella turns and walks back to his car.
Ben slowly tries to stand, can’t. He falls back again.

JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
We gotta get you to a hospital.

CUT TO:

JIMMY’S FRONT PORCH

Ben sits on the top step. He’s bent over, and has a
homemade ice-pack on his face.

Jimmy sits next to him.

BEN
No. No hospitals. Just want to
lie down.

JIMMY

Uh uh. I won’t let you close your
eyes until we get you checked out.

Ben forces himself to sit up straighter.

BEN
You won’t let me?

JIMMY
No. You could have internal shit
going on. Could’ve hit your head
on the ground. We need a doctor.

BEN
We. We need one?

JIMMY
Yeah.

BEN

fucking good to be true. Why the
fuck do you care if I get looked

friends.’

JIMMY
But we are.

BEN
I hadn’t seen you in thirty years.

JIMMY
Doesn’t change anything.

BEN
See, that’s where we’re different.
I never put much faith in that
whole racket.

JIMMY
The friendship racket?

BEN
Yeah.

JIMMY

You had more pals then you knew
what to do with when you were
here.

Ben wobbles for a moment. Steadies himself with his arms.

Ben tries

BEN
Look, there’s a place for friends.
Know where? In the midrange.
Because that's where everyone’s
comfortable. When you’re just
like them. Right in the middle.
But in the highest moments, the
lowest, you’re alone. When I was
on the cover of Forbes, I was
there by myself. When I was on
the cover of the times business
section in handcuffs, I was by
myself again.

JIMMY
That’s not--

BEN
Please.

BEN
At the top, they pull at you,
smile at you, but they, all of
them, would kill you, literally
kill you, to take your place.

BEN (CONT'D)
And on my way to that court house--
you think anyone wanted to know
what was really going on in my
head, take a real peak in there?
No. It was just me.

JIMMY
I remember Nancy. No way she
treated you like that.

A long beat. Not even Ben can argue against that one.

BEN
Nope. Nancy was legit. And I was
legit with her. When I couldn’t
be anymore, I left.

JIMMY
And where’s that left you? Don’t
you see?

BEN
It’s fine.

JIMMY

But even in jail, that's
considered the worst, isn't it.
Solitary? No companionship--

BEN
Solitary wouldn't be a problem for
me. It wouldn't be any different.

JIMMY
I’m sorry to hear that, Ben. I
really am.

Ben gets to his feet. Steadies himself. Jimmy grabs him
by the arm, leads him to the front door.

Ben puts a hand out to grab the railing. They stop

moving.

JIMMY
For what it's worth, when you were
on the cover of Forbes, felt like
I was on the cover. I saved it
and everything.

Ben says nothing for a long moment. Then.

BEN
I believe you.

CONTINUED: (3)

JIMMY
Good. Let’s get inside then.

Jimmy turns to head in. Ben takes a step toward the door
then BUCKLES, falls to a knee.

BEN
You know something, I think that
guy might’ve busted my rib.
Ben coughs once more. It doesn’t sound good. A little
blood comes up with it, dribbles out of the corner of his
mouth.

BEN
Damn.

Jimmy catches Ben just as he passes out.

CUT TO:

HOSPITAL ROOM

Two nights later. Ben, taped around the chest, lies
motionless.

Susan sits in a bedside chair, hands in her lap.

After a moment, Ben STIRS and opens his eyes.

BEN
Susie.

SUSAN
Hi Dad.

BEN

Hi. I can understand myself now.
Ben struggles to lift his head from the pillow.

SUSAN
They lowered the dose of
painkillers. Had to keep it high
so you wouldn’t move too much,
cause more internal damage.
You’re going to be okay.

BEN
You came. To see me.

She takes his hand in hers.

(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:

SUSAN
Yeah.

BEN
You’re gold, Suze, gold.

Ben puts his head back down.

BEN
How long can you stay?

SUSAN
For now. TI have to head back in
the morning. You rest. I’11 sit
with you ‘til then.

BEN
I’m sorry about Carol Solomon. I
know I shouldn’t have--

SUSAN
Shhh. Forget about that now.
Rest.

BEN

Thanks, Pumpkin.

Ben closes his eyes and Susan sits back in her chair
never letting go of Ben’s hand.

DISSOLVE TO:

MORNING IN BEN’S ROOM

Susan is gone and Ben is woken up by an Eastern European
NURSE, who tends to his bandages.

NURSE
You’re healing quite nicely.

BEN
Still hurts like a beast.

NURSE
It will be sore for some time
still. The doctors will be in
after their rounds. They spoke to
your doctor back in New York, and
while you were under sedation they
ran a series of tests. I know
they want to discuss those results
with you.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

102.

BEN
What kind of tests? How did they
know who to speak to?

NURSE
You told them and signed consent
forms when you came in.

BEN
I don’t remember.

NURSE
You wouldn’t. The alcohol and
shock to your system was pretty
extreme.

BEN
What kind of tests?

NURSE
They did a series, as I said.
Concentrating on your heart.

Ben looks around the room.

BEN
Am I still connected to any of
this?

NURSE
Just the IV.

BEN

Disconnect it, please.

NURSE
That’s against doctor’s orders.

BEN
Well, I’m leaving. And I can’t
drag that thing behind me.

Ben gathers his energy and sits up.

CUT TO:

MODEST HOUSE

A taxi slows in front of Jimmy’s house.

Ben gets out and struggles up the driveway.

He sees Allyson waiting on the porch.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

103.

ALLYSON
I’ve been calling the hospital
every morning. They said no
visitors except family. And then
today they said you left. SoTI
thought I’d wait here for you. I
hope you don’t mind.

BEN
I’ve never had a problem with it.
Your father might not be thrilled
though.

ALLYSON
I told my dad if anything else
happened to you, I wouldn’t ever
talk to him again. He knows I’m
serious because I once didn’t talk
to him for nine months. He won’t
chance it.

Ben eases himself down into a chair.

BEN
Only daughters have that kind of
power.

ALLYSON

Yeah. And it’s almost enough to
keep him around.

BEN
Right. You have that ‘daddy
thing.’ I remember.

Ben’s phone rings. The caller ID reads “Mass General

Hospital.”

Ben hits ignore.
ALLYSON
Do you want me to come in for a
while?
BEN
You know what, I think I need to
rest.
ALLYSON
You sure?
BEN

Yeah. Do me a favor though?..

ALLYSON
What’s that?

(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED: (2)

BEN
Help me up.

She grabs him by the arm and guides him into the house.

CUT TO:

PLAYROOM

It’s morning. Ben opens his eyes to his cell phone
ringing. Caller ID: “Mass General Hospital.” Once
again, he hits ignore.

CUT TO:

JIMMY’S FRONT PORCH
Ben exits the house, a purposeful expression on his face.

CUT TO:

CHESTON’S HOUSE

Ben rings the bell. He has a department store bag in his
hand.

After a moment, Cheston comes to the door.

CHESTON
Ben.

Ben hands Cheston the bag.
BEN

I treated you wrong, kid. I’m
here to make it right.

CHESTON
Really.
BEN
Yep. You gave me back my shirt.

But I never gave you back the one
I borrowed. And that’s wrong.

Cheston looks inside the bag.

CHESTON
This isn’t my shirt.

(CONTINUED)
105.

CONTINUED:

A beat.

Ben nods.

BEN
Well, that particular shirt is in
a box in New York somewhere. But
I picked one out I thought would
look good on you.

CHESTON
Thanks.

Then Ben gets to it.

BEN
It’s possible there have been
other ways I treated you wrong.

CHESTON
I know. She told me. She didn’t
want to, but I saw something was
bothering her...She said you were
drunk, that I shouldn’t be mad.
It was just sad, but that’s who
you are.

BEN
See, she might actually be a Good
One. I forgot to tell you about
the Good Ones. They’re different
than all the others. And rare.
When you get a Good One, you don’t
want to fuck it up.

Ben smiles.

CHESTON
I figured that lesson out on my
own.

BEN

Yeah, Cheston, you would. Because
you’re a good one too.

CHESTON
Thanks for the shirt. I have to--

BEN
Go ahead. Hit those books.

Cheston nods at Ben, goes back inside.

CUT TO:

JAMES J. MCCOUNS

Ben, mostly healed by now, and Jimmy, are closing up as
the last customers leave.

JIMMY
I’m taking Anne to the North End
for dinner tonight. Daily Catch.
You want to come with?

BEN
I think I’ve intruded enough in
your home. You go take your wife
out, have a wonderful time. And
leave a sock on the door if you
need some alone time afterwards.

JIMMY
The sock. That’s right. I forgot
about that.

BEN

You also forget about the time me
and Nance intentionally ‘forgot’
to put the sock out, just so we
could see your face when you
walked in on us.

JIMMY
That I remember. You had a puny
little--

BEN
Hey--

JIMMY

Ass. I was saying a small ass
back then, when we were kids.

The men laugh with each other, remembering.
Jimmy throws some dishes into the washer.
BEN
You know what, go. Let me finish
out. Do the dishes. You have a
great night.
JIMMY
You don’t have to make that offer
twice.
And Jimmy grabs his stuff and leaves.

DISSOLVE TO:
107.

JAMES J. MCCOUNS
Some time has passed. Ben dries the last of the dishes,

puts them away. He grabs his jacket, walks out the front
door and locks it.

QUAD

Ben makes his way across the quad. The first signs of
Spring are about.

It’s fairly quiet, although there is a twilight Frisbee
golf game going on.

Ben watches the kids throw a few, then continues walking.

Suddenly, he stops. He sees...

NANCY, SITTING ON THEIR BENCH.

She smiles at Ben. He returns it. No mixed feelings.
He’s really glad to see her.

She motions for him to come sit down. He does.

BEN
Hi Nance.

NANCY
Let’s save ‘hi’ for a sec.
I just want an answer. No
equivocating.

BEN
Okay.

NANCY
When was the first time a doctor
sent you for a heart scan?

Ben reacts.

BEN
Hospital called you?

NANCY
They called Susan.

BEN
You have the results?

NANCY
I do. Now answer me.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

108.

BEN
Doctor Steinberg ordered that test
about six years ago.

NANCY
How long after that did you start
cheating?

BEN
That day.

NANCY

Uh huh. And you never went for
the test, did you?

BEN
Nope.

Silence from Nancy.

BEN
Look. I can’t use that as an
excuse. It was a factor, but
everything was building up anyway.

NANCY
Building up how?

BEN
I was turning invisible.

NANCY
Invisible?

BEN

You couldn’t understand, Nance.
Thirty years ago, when I walked
into a room, the room changed.
Just ‘cause I showed up. Out of
college, self-made, great shape,
TV commercials, all of it.

NANCY
I remember. I was right there
next to the camera when you shot
them.

BEN
Then you remember what I was like
back then: A lion. And that’s how
people treated me. But it started
to change the past ten or twelve
years. I’d walk into a room and
only the older crowd would notice.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

A beat.

109.

BEN (CONT'D)
Because they knew who I was. But
to everyone else: invisible.

NANCY
You were never invisible to me.
BEN
Doesn’t count. You were my wife.
NANCY
It’s what happens, Bennie, we get
old.
BEN

Hey. I accept that it’s
biological. But I can’t accept
that it happened to me. When
Steinberg thought he saw something
on my EKG, I got nervous at first.
He told me to go get that heart
scan, to see how much blockage
there was. I walked out of his
office with every intention of
getting it checked out.

NANCY
Instead...

BEN
Instead I went to some bar and
grill on Lexington Ave, had a
couple to calm myself, and took
the first young lady who said
‘yes’ to a suite at the Carlisle.

BEN
That was the first time I ever
stepped out on you.

NANCY
What’d it do for you?
BEN
The truth--it did plenty.
NANCY
And then. .?
BEN

And then I felt horrible. I’d
broken something. The only thing
that had ever counted. Me and
you.

BEN (CONT'D)
It was over after that between us.
Even if you didn’t know, I did. I
knew we could never make it work
again after that.

NANCY
So you not only cheated, you
wouldn’t even give me the chance
to forgive you.

BEN
Would you have?

NANCY
I don’t know. I think so.

BEN
I figured you’d see it on my face,
know straight away. But you
didn’t. Nothing happened. So I
kept going.

NANCY
Of course.

BEN
And then, not long after, I was at
my shop in White Plains. And I
saw all those cars sitting there
in the lot. And I thought, why am
I ‘New York’s honest car dealer?’
So I got the guy who inspected the
floorplanning for the car company
and we worked it out. He’d
pretend I had more cars on the lot
than I really did, and I’d send
him on vacations all around the
world. I also let my managers
know that I wouldn’t be checking
their work as closely as I had in
the past, freed them up to work
whatever they wanted. And again.
Nobody seemed to notice. For
years.

NANCY
And the whole time you knew that
your heart could blow at any
second, so you wouldn’t have to
pay the price. Why didn’t you go
get the test to find out for sure?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

111.
(4)

BEN
I’m going to give some doctor that
kind of power over me, to tell me
the where, when and how? No way.
You know how it is at our age. The
best thing a doctor says is: ‘the
survival rate is high.’ Or, ‘it’s
a good cancer.’ Or, ‘we got it
early.’ I decided I didn’t want
to hear any of it. And TI
certainly wasn’t going to let them
put me on a bunch of beta blockers
and other crap to slow me down,
level me out. I was going to
live, on my own terms, right up
until the fucking thing in my
chest exploded.

NANCY
And the screwing around and the
stealing, it all made you feel
alive, like you were cheating
death, didn’t it.

BEN
Worked for a while.

NANCY
Well you can’t cheat it, Benny.
No one can. It’s gonna get you no
matter how many nineteen year olds
you talk into your bed.

BEN
I know that now. I really do
know.

NANCY

Well, I am going to share these
results with you. Since I have
the information, you need the
information.

Nancy takes a MANILLA ENVELOPE from her bag.

NANCY
The cardiologist at Mass General
said you have the heart of a forty-
year-old. No calcium deposits.
No blockages.

BEN
None? But the EKG...

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

112.
(5)

NANCY
The EKG was inconclusive. That’s
why Steinberg ordered the test.
The scan’s in that envelope. With
the report.

Nancy hands the Envelope to Ben.

NANCY
All else being equal, you’re going
to be around for years and years.
You better figure out how you want
to live them.

Ben sets the envelope down on his lap, unopened.

NANCY

I thought a lot about how I want
to live driving here, and what I
came up with is: with the guy I
met on this bench. The guy who
gave me my daughter. But I don’t
know if that guy still exists. If
he doesn’t, I have to move on, for
good. Because I know this ride
isn’t meant to be taken alone.

BEN
Why would you give me that shot?

NANCY
For the same reason I chose you
when we were here. You weren’t
like everyone else. You were
smarter. You worked harder. You
weren’t some rich kid full of shit
and your father’s wing tip shoes.
And you were kind.

BEN
But it was a lie. In the end, I
was just as bad as all of them.

NANCY
No. You just stopped believing
you were different.

Ben listens hard, moved.

BEN
I hurt you. And Susan. I’m
sorry.

They look at each other.

CONTINUED: (6)

NANCY
I’m parked right over there.
Happy to drive you back to New
York if you’re ready. Happy to
let you sleep on our couch while
we figure it all out. And as you
know, it’s a damn comfortable
couch.

Nancy smiles. Ben returns the warmth.

BEN
I knew that’s why you kept it.

NANCY
Hey--that couch is all I’m
offering for now.

BEN
Understood.

Nancy stands.
NANCY
Take a minute. Read those
results. Think about what you
really want.

She walks away, gets into her car, which is parked at the
edge of the quad.

Ben takes the Heart Scan Results out of the envelope,
reads them.

He looks up. Sees Nancy in her car. Smiles at her.
Leans forward to get up.

And then he notices, crossing right by him, a BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG GIRL. His eyes follow her as she approaches the
campus bookstore.

Ben looks back to Nancy.

Looks back to the Girl.

Looks back to Nancy.

Back to the Girl.

And then, after one more moment’s thought, he stands.

We...
