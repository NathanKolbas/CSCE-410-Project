                       One Fine Day 
          
                         DAVID LETTERMAN
          Here's what it is. I heard that my, my 
          son David Jr., you met Dave Jr. on the 
          last -- This is great news. I heard now, 
          I was notified Sunday that David Jr. 
          will be tried as a juvenile for grand 
          theft auto. 
          
                         VOICE
          Dial 911. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy. Mom? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hmm? 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm really thirsty, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay? Okay, sweetie. Mmm. Good night. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Wait! There's one more sip left. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Half a sip. You don't need it. Good 
          night. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I do need it. I do need it, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Now, good night for real, okay? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Good night, Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Night-night, honey. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm really excited about the field trip 
          tomorrow. I love big boats. 
          
                         MELANIE
          That's good. 
          
                         SAMMY
          The Circle Line is big, right? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Good. Mom? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Shhh. Sleepy time now. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Is Daddy coming to my soccer game 
          tomorrow? 
          
                         MELANIE
          He's gonna try, Sammy. Honey, do you 
          remember when I explained to you that 
          daddy has a, uh, different schedule than 
          a lot of other daddies? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yeah. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, musicians, they don't always know 
          exactly when they're gonna get a chance 
          to play? So, uh, there's a chance he 
          might not come tomorrow. 
          
                         SAMMY
          But he's gonna try? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah, he's gonna try. I love you a 
          million, billion, zillion. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Do you love him? Huh, Mommy? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I will always love your daddy because he 
          gave me you. Now go to sleep. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I can't sleep, Mom. I had a bad dream. 
          
                         MELANIE
          In just two minutes, you already fell 
          asleep and had a bad dream? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Ow! Oh, sweetie. Oh, shoot. 
          
                         RADIO
          I don't even think I knew her. No, I had 
          no idea. I divorced her. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Dad! 
          
                         JACK
          Hi. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi, Daddy! 
          
                         JACK
          Hey! I got you! Watch your step. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Maggie, be careful! 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I do it all the time, Mom. 
          
                         JACK
          Does it all the time. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          I can't believe you still haven't gotten 
          the plumbing fixed, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          So what's up, Kristen? 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Um, well, you know that, um, me and Greg 
          got married last Saturday. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, yeah. How's Greg? 
          
                         KRISTEN
          He's downstairs waiting in the car. 
          Waiting with an ulcer hoping you'll say 
          yes. I need you to watch Maggie for me. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. Yeah, I can do that till about 
          six. Would that help? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Well-- 
          
                         MAGGIE
          For the whole week, Daddy. The whole 
          week. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          We were scheduled t-to leave this 
          morning on our honeymoon, but our Nanny 
          called to say t-that, that she's gotta 
          go watch her mother have a benign tumor 
          removed in Ohio. Greg's parents are too 
          old, mine-mine are t-too, too crazy, 
          yours are dead. The tickets are 
          nonrefundable, so that leaves you. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Please, Jack, do this. Please! 
          
                         JACK
          Kristen. Now you liten. I would love to, 
          but you know, I'm-I'm working on a story 
          right now. So-- 
          
                         KRISTEN
          You're always working on a story. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, yeah. It's what I do. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          It's the same, old one about an every-
          other-weekend good-time father for whom 
          responsibility is a dirty word. 
          
                         JACK
          Here's a hint, Kristen? During an 
          attempted manipulation like the one 
          that's in progress, I would've gone with 
          flattery. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Why do I always have to be such grownup 
          where you always get to be the little 
          boy? 
          
                         JACK
          'Cause in the beginning of the 
          relationship when we were choosing 
          upsides, you chose grownup first. This 
          is how you really want it, Kristen. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          No, what I really want is -- just once -
          - for you to make a sacrifice in your 
          career for your daughter. She really 
          want to be with you, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          I'd really like to do that. Come here, 
          my little-- Come on. Come here, my 
          little noodle. I'm a creature. Grrr! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Go pee, wash your hands and face, and 
          brush your teeth. We're in a little bit 
          of a hurry this morning, 'cause we have 
          to take your friend Maggie to school. 
          And we can't be late because of your 
          field trip. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I hate Maggie. She thinks she's so 
          funny. 
          
                         JACK
          Maggie? 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Hey, Jack, here's Maggie's doctor's 
          number. 
          
                         JACK
          Where are you? 
          
                         KRISTEN
          And the number of a really good baby-
          sitter who can help you out tomorrow. 
          She's got a walk-on part on a soap 
          today. And, Jack, there's one last 
          thing. This is really important. My 
          neighbor was supposed to take Maggie to 
          the Westside Montessori School for me 
          this morning. Okay? She lives in my 
          building. Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Upp. Hupp! 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Jack? Apartment 501. This is her number. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Her name is Melanie Parker. 
          
                         JACK
          Melanie Parker. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Now, if you want her to take Maggie to 
          school for you -- if you want her to 
          take Maggie to school for you, bring 
          Maggie to her house before eight, so you 
          don't miss them. If not, call Mel and 
          let her know that you don't need her to 
          take Maggie. Jack, okay? 
          
                         KRISTEN
          I'm gonna miss my plane. You know, I 
          don't think this is a very good idea. 
          Maybe I should just cancel my honeymoon. 
          
                         JACK
          Don't cancel your honeymoon. Give me 
          these. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Are you sure? 
          
                         JACK
          Yep. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Okay. Uh, those are the telephone 
          numbers. 
          
                         JACK
          Say hi to Greg. 
          
                         KRISTEN
          Bye, baby! 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Bye! 
          
                         JACK
          Bye, baby. Bye, baby! Oh, baby, oh! Oh! 
          Oh! Oh! 
          
                         SAMMY
          Come on, Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Press 2, honey. 
          
                         SAMMY
          What? Ah! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Wonder where they are. 
          
                         JACK
          Some more? We got s'mores, but we're 
          gonna need some more. We're having a 
          Manhattan camp-out. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Why don't you bang on the door? 
          
                         MELANIE
          We can't bang on the door of 
          honeymooners. 
          
                         JACK
          What time does your school start? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I don't know. 
          
                         JACK
          It probably starts at 9:00. Everything 
          starts at 9:00. You know, we're gonna 
          get there a few minutes early just to be 
          safe. What's street your school on? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I don't know. 
          
                         JACK
          Ha. We're in trouble. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm gonna miss the boat trip, aren't I? 
          
                         MELANIE
          They're never gonna leave on time. We'll 
          make it. I promise. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Let's run. Just in case. 
          
                         SAMMY
          What's it say? 
          
                         JACK
          "The whole school is on the Circle Line. 
          Sorry we missed you." That's a big "uh-
          oh," right? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You must be Kristen's ex-husband. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi, Sammy. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Hi, Maggie. 
          
                         JACK
          You must be, uh-- 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. You're not, uh, Sheila, the 
          actress/baby-sitter, you're not Maggie's 
          pediatrician, Dr. Feldman. Hey, here you 
          go. "You don't forget to call Melanie 
          Parker." It's underlined three times. 
          We're not quite together this morning. 
          I'm sorry. What do you mean, I must be 
          Kristen's ex-husband? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, that's Kristen's daughter and this 
          is a totally ex-husband thing to do. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, you would know because that's a 
          totally ex-wife remark. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know, I have a day. Taxi! Taxi! 
          
                         JACK
          Get those fish. Let's go. Come on. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Dad! 
          
                         JACK
          Hold it! Got it! Come on! Wait! Wait! 
          Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, you forgot your 
          fish! Take those. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Pier 56, please as fast as you can. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I don't wanna sit next to Maggie. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I don't wanna sit next to Sammy. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. Come on, let's go. Come on. Over 
          the top. Could you please just take 
          those? Thank you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't know where you get off having an 
          attitude since it's your fault that both 
          our kids will probably miss their fielf 
          trip. 
          
                         JACK
          Attitude. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know, I'd rather you not take 
          Central Park West. I think Broadway will 
          be faster. 
          
                         JACK
          My attitude is derived from your 
          attitude. 
          
                         MELANIE
          "Derived?" You must be a writer. 
          
                         JACK
          Let me guess. Your ex-husband is a 
          writer. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. My ex-husband is a musician. 
          
                         JACK
          Huh. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't need to see that. I already have 
          an opining of you. 
          
                         JACK
          And I of you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Liza. Liza, thank God you're home. 
          Listen, I-I need to ask you a huge 
          favor. 
          
                         LIZA
          Melanie? Is that you? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         LIZA
          You sound awful. Where are you? Don't 
          answer. I can't talk right now. I'm on 
          the other line organizing Kyle's Fun 
          Run. Bye, honey. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. No, no, no, no. No, wait. Don't hang 
          up. I really need you-- 
          
                         LIZA
          Oh. Ho ho! Ho ho! Oh, bye, honey. 
          
                         LIZA
          Hello? Hello? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah, I'm here. 
          
                         LIZA
          What's the matter? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, there's this guy, who obviously 
          thinks that a, uh, minor amount of charm 
          replaces integrity and commitment, has, 
          uh, not only ruined my day, but Sammy's 
          as well. He's completely missed his 
          field trip. 
          
                         SAMMY
          My Mom hates your dad. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          So? My Dad hates your mom. 
          
                         SAMMY
          So? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          So? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Liza? 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, it's me. Just wanted to know if 
          you're wearing panties. What color are 
          they? 
          
                         LEW
          Huh? 
          
                         MAN
          Lew, I need this photo approved now! 
          
                         MELANIE
          If I ever act interested in another man 
          again, would you please shoot me? No, 
          don't take 57th across! 
          
                         JACK
          Pink? 
          
                         WOMAN
          When is Jack getting in? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, I will not leave Sammy at the 9th 
          Street Drop-In Center, Liza. 
          
                         LIZA
          Why? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Because he hates it there. You're my 
          sis, how can you not watch him for me? 
          Look, I-I-I-I have to meet my boss in 
          fifteen minutes, then I have this 
          presentation which-which-which could add 
          up to huge promotion for me. And-And you 
          have no job, a Nanny, a cook and a 
          housekeeper? 
          
                         LIZA
          The nanny is leaving to take Courtney to 
          Mommy and me, Angela is cooking all day 
          for our dinner party tonight, Berta is 
          cleaning for our dinner party tonight, 
          and I am working in the school office 
          this morning. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay, what about later? 
          
                         LIZA
          Later I'm getting dressed for our party 
          tonight. Mel, why don't you get a nanny? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Because I can't afford a nanny, Liza. 
          
                         LEW
          You're with a girl, aren't you? You dog, 
          you. Ha ha! 
          
                         JACK
          A real superwoman. Can't open her door. 
          Won't shut her mouth. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me, are you talking about me? 
          
                         JACK
          The First Lady. We're thinking about 
          doing a piece on her. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, you're insulted because I said that 
          I had a presentation and that you don't 
          work. 
          
                         LIZA
          I do work, Melanie. I'm the CEO of this 
          household. I'm sorry if I can't help you 
          out today, but you're perfect. You'll 
          figure it out. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Okay. Bye. DRIVER
          I'm telling you, who do you think-- 
          
                         MELANIE
          Right, right, right. Okay, okay, okay, 
          okay! Stay with me. Stay with me. There 
          are cars. Oh! Oh, thank God it's still 
          here! 
          
                         JACK
          Come on. Let's go! Here we go! Come on! 
          
                         MELANIE
          This is it. 
          
                         JACK
          That's not it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          How do you know? 
          
                         JACK
          There's nobody in there! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maybe they're upstairs. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, they're upstairs. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy. Sammy, wait up for me. 
          
                         JACK
          Here. I got it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, no. I'm fine. Thank you. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay! Excuse me! All right, here we go! 
          Take a boat! 
          
                         JACK
          Go! Go! Watch your step! 
          
                         MELANIE
          It was the first boat. I'm telling you, 
          it was the first boat. 
          
                         JACK
          First boat? There wasn't anybody on the 
          first boat! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, no! 
          
                         JACK
          It's all right. We can still make it, 
          goddammit! 
          
                         JACK
          Hey! Hey, boat! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come 
          in here! Come back! I got kids over 
          here! Come back! Hey! Hey! I got kids 
          here! 
          
                         JACK
          Goddammit! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, who wants to go on a boat in the 
          rain, anyway? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I know. You did. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. Listen, uh, Melanie. I feel 
          awful about this and we'll make it up to 
          you. You too, kiddo. All right? 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay, here's an idea. What say, I watch 
          the kids right now while you do your 
          presentation -- I overheard you said you 
          had one in fifteen minutes -- and then 
          you watch them for me later on today 
          while I do the column? It'll only take, 
          you know, an hour or so. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi. Maggie Taylor calling. I have an 
          urgent message for stupid Sammy Parker. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm not stupid. 
          
                         JACK
          What do you say? 
          
                         SAMMY
          You're stupid. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't think so. I only let incredibly 
          responsible people watch my son. 
          
                         JACK
          I'm incredibly responsible. Huh? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I'm hungry, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          Want a Tic-Tac? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No. 
          
                         JACK
          That's all I got. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Here, baby. 
          
                         JACK
          What's that? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Nothing. Thank you, Melanie. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You're welcome, sweetheart. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You were saying? 
          
                         JACK
          Well, uh, I was saying that maybe we 
          could just help each other, help each 
          other out today. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well... 
          
                         JACK
          Hey. Looks like you missed the boat. 
          
                         WOMAN
          I guess we did. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I really don't need your help. But if I 
          did, you would be the very last person I 
          would turn to. These are the class fish. 
          They were supposed to be back in the 
          classroom at 8:30 this morning. Now they 
          are spending the day with you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          God, I am going to be so late. I have 
          such a day. Oh! A bus! 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Phones aren't toys. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom, it's not your phone. Mom! 
          
                         JACK
          Don't be like that when you grow up. 
          
                         JACK
          She, um, she just drops off the-the, uh, 
          the bag of cookies and asks me to keep 
          them for a week. 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          And how do you feel about the cookies, 
          Jack? 
          
                         JACK
          Love the cookies. I have a big problem 
          with, uh, the, uh... 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          Cookie maker? 
          
                         JACK
          That's right. Because the cookie maker 
          thinks that all I am interested in or 
          all that I am, uh, capable of handling, 
          uh, with respect to the cookie in 
          question, is, uh, the, uh... 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          The frosting? 
          
                         JACK
          Exactly. Exactly. Now, just because the 
          frosting is my specialty doesn't mean 
          that I can't do more. I have many layers 
          to me. And they're not all vanilla, 
          either. I have chocolate in me. I have a 
          deep dark chocolate. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I'm still hungry, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, don't -- I'm so -- Um, Doc Martin 
          and I are finishing. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          But what about the cookies? 
          
                         JACK
          Just a little while, okay? Uh, it's just 
          -- I-I am-- I'm sick of angry, 
          resentful, uh, fish who, uh, think that 
          you, that-that-that you owe them, but 
          who won't trust you for a second to do 
          anything for them. 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          There are other fish in the sea, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, I know. It's just I-- I wish I 
          could find a fish who wasn't afraid of 
          my dark chocolate layer and, well, she'd 
          have to love my cookie, too. You know, I 
          think that my ex-cookie-maker has turned 
          me off to fish entirely. I met a real 
          piece of work this morning. 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          Tell me about her, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          This fish was a fox. She has her own 
          cookie, too. But what a female dog. She 
          shoved her fish in my face. 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          In front of the cookie? What's she doing 
          with another fish, anyway? Is she AC/DC? 
          
                         JACK
          What're you talking about? 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          Fish with other fish in front of 
          cookies. 
          
                         JACK
          Fish. Fish fish. 
          
                         DR. MARTIN
          Oh. I see. 
          
                         GENTLEMAN
          Ah, after you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. After you. 
          
                         GENTLEMAN
          No, I insist. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I insist more. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You can't make any noise in the office. 
          I have a really important meeting, okay? 
          Oh! Ohh! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Don't touch that. 
          
                         SAMMY
          It's empty. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy, I'm really late and I don't need 
          you spilling anything right now. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Whee-ha! Whoo! Whoo! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Please don't do that now. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Why not? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Because I want you to practice being 
          super quiet. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Now, you stay next to me. Got your 
          dino? Don't you start any noises, okay? 
          
                         EVELYN
          You're kidding. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Just five minutes. Please don't give me 
          a hard time now. Evelyn, please. I'm 
          almost twenty minutes late. 
          
                         EVELYN
          Twenty-five minutes late. Mr. Leland, as 
          you might expect, is displeased. 
          
                         MELANIE
          What are those? 
          
                         EVELYN
          The Haskell blueprints. Rob Wilding got 
          them in three weeks ahead of schedule. 
          
                         MELANIE
          He did? 
          
                         EVELYN
          Why would you bring a child here? 
          Remember when Sally Hanson brought her 
          kid here with the poison sumac? Mr. 
          Leland just smelled the calamine lotion 
          and had to take the rest of the day off? 
          
                         MELANIE
          He does not have poison anything, 
          Evelyn. He's not even sick. He just 
          missed his field trip is all. 
          
                         EVELYN
          I don't think so. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Five minutes, please? 
          
                         EVELIN
          And I would be doing this because? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Of our sense of solidarity? You know, 
          we're both women, and this is a tough 
          office and a tough world-- 
          
                         EVELYN
          Five minutes. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thank you. 
          
                         LELAND
          Evelyn, has Ms. Parker come in yet? 
          
                         LELAND
          Ms. Parker, you're late. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes, I'm late. I know. I'm sorry, sir. 
          
                         LELAND
          You're late. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Let me go get the model. I'll be right 
          in. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, my God. Oh... Oh my... 
          
                         LELAND
          Evelyn, would you ask Ms. Parker to come 
          in here, please? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No! Shh! Sh! Shh! 
          
                         EVELYN
          She'll be right in. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Put this in the back room for me, 
          please. Would you -- 
          
                         EVELYN
          Go, go, go, go, go. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You, get behind the desk and stay there. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'm sorry, sir, I forgot, the model is 
          still in the model shop downtown. I'm-
          I'm heading there right now to-- You 
          see, I went by there, um, earlier this 
          morning to pick it up for this morning, 
          but the shop was, um, locked, so-- 
          
                         LELAND
          Oh. 
          
                         MELANIE
          And I promise you you're going to love 
          the model, though, Mr. Leland, sir, and 
          that today at two o'clock, the people 
          from Yates & Yates Construction are 
          going to love it, too. 
          
                         LELAND
          I assume you're ready. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Of course. 
          
                         LELAND
          There's something I'd like to show you. 
          Evelyn, would you bring in the Haskell 
          blueprints? Oh! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh. Oh, ha ha. Ohh! What an adorable, 
          little boy! 
          
                         LELAND
          Also, would you check if my amoxycillian 
          prescription still has refills 
          available? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know what? That's a good idea. Let's 
          go find your mom. 
          
                         EVELYN
          I'm very sorry, sir, but someone spilled 
          my coffee all over the Haskell 
          blueprints. 
          
                         LELAND
          Oh, my God. Do you know that every 
          Thanksgiving I catch strep throat? 
          Children who are perfectly healthy can 
          give you strep throat from other kids 
          they know without your even going near 
          them. My sister sets up a kids table in 
          the next room and I still get strep 
          throat. 
          
                         MELANIE
          We're going to go find his mother, sir. 
          
                         LELAND
          She must work in those new law offices 
          across the hall. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'm sure she does. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Um, excuse me. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hello? 
          
                         LEW
          You asshole! 
          
                         MELANIE
          What? 
          
                         LEW
          You'd better get right over here. The 
          Mayor's called a press conference, five 
          o'clock, City Hall. While you were 
          talking about pink panties, your story 
          was turning to shit! 
          
                         LELAND
          You know, Miss Parker. I don't need to 
          remind you what the Yates account would 
          be worth to this firm and by extension, 
          to you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. No, sir. 
          
                         LELAND
          You know what I think of when I look at 
          him? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. 
          
                         LELAND
          Carrier monkey. 
          
                         MELANIE
          He's not a carrier monkey, sir. He, he 
          looks like a healthy, little -- 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'll go find his mother. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, my God. What am I gonna do? 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm sorry, Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh. It's okay, sweetie. It's really not 
          your fault. It's Maggie's daddy's fault. 
          
                         JACK
          Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! 
          
                         MAGGIE
          This isn't a very good breakfast, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh. You see, that's one of the 
          advantages of being an adult. You've got 
          to act like a kid any time you feel like 
          it. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Mommy would never let me have hamburgers 
          and milk shakes for breakfast. 
          
                         JACK
          See what I mean? 
          
                         JACK
          Hello? 
          
                         RITA
          Who's that? 
          
                         JACK
          Who's this? 
          
                         RITA
          Who's this? 
          
                         JACK
          Who's this? 
          
                         RITA
          Who's this? What are you doing with my 
          daughter's phone? 
          
                         JACK
          Well, uh, damn it. We must have 
          switched. Um, I'm Jack Taylor. Our kids 
          in school together. 
          
                         RITA
          "You don't know Jack", Jack Taylor? 
          
                         JACK
          That's me. 
          
                         RITA
          Oh, my God! You're so adorable. I love 
          your column. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, thanks. 
          
                         RITA
          You married? 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, no. I'm divorced. Uh, um, what's 
          your name? 
          
                         RITA
          Rita. 
          
                         JACK
          Rita. 
          
                         RITA
          Uh, listen, Jack. I've got to go get 
          exfoliated. Now-Now, Melanie has your 
          phone, right? 
          
                         JACK
          That's right. 
          
                         RITA
          Uh, so what is that number? 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, PEnnsylvania 3317. 
          
                         RITA
          PEnnsylvania -- so cute -- 3317. 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, my dad used to tell the story. 
          
                         RITA
          All right, darling, listen. If you speak 
          with her before I do, would you do me a 
          favor? Her sister telephoned me here to 
          see if I would baby-sit Sammy later on, 
          but I'm in the middle of my Spring Spa 
          Day at Elizabeth Arden's. I can't 
          possibly cancel now. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         RITA
          But, uh, tell her that otherwise I would 
          have been happy to baby-sit, because no 
          matter what she thinks, I have forgotten 
          all about Sammy putting my wedding ring 
          up his nose. 
          
                         JACK
          I'll tell her, Rita. 
          
                         RITA
          You're adorable. 
          
                         JACK
          All right, good-bye. 
          
                         RITA
          Good-bye. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hello? 
          
                         JACK
          It's Jack Taylor. 
          
                         MELANIE
          How did you get this number? 
          
                         JACK
          That's my phone you're holding. 
          
                         MELANIE
          This is so typical of you. 
          
                         JACK
          What do we say we bypass the hostilities 
          and just do messages? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Fine. 
          
                         JACK
          Your mother's in the middle of Spring 
          Spa Day and can't baby-sit, but she 
          wants you to know it's not because she's 
          upset about Sammy sticking her ring up 
          her nose. 
          
                         MELANIE
          His nose. Thank you. You have a press 
          conference at five. 
          
                         JACK
          Mm-hmm. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Good-bye. 
          
                         JACK
          Think maybe we oughta arrange to switch 
          our phones back? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Tomorrow morning when we drop the kids 
          off at school. On time. 
          
                         JACK
          Fine. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Fine. 
          
                         JACK
          Maggie, when you grow up, and you are 
          incredibly beautiful and intelligent, 
          and possess a certain sweetness that's 
          like a distant promise to the brave and 
          to the worthy, can ya please not beat to 
          a pulp every miserable bastard who comes 
          your way just because you can? Can you 
          just not do that? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Okay, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. 
          
                         FOREIGN ARTIST
          Uh, let me help you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It's okay. I can get it. 
          
                         FOREIGN ARTIST
          No, no. Please, please. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Really! I got it. I got it. Okay, okay. 
          Sweetie, come on. 
          
                         FOREIGN ARTIST
          Stupid American woman. 
          
                         SAMMY
          That guy called you stupid. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, I am stupid sometimes, honey, but 
          I'd rather be stupid than sorry. Come 
          on. 
          
                         MELANIE
          How bad is it? 
          
                         VICNENT
          Well, it's modular. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Mm-hmm. 
          
                         VICNENT
          So it's conceivable I could lift out 
          that damaged portion and replace it with 
          the same piece from the mock-up. That 
          way, I wouldn't have to start from 
          scratch. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Vincent, that's brilliant! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy! Honey! Sammy, you cannot run 
          around, okay? 
          
                         VICNENT
          It won't be perfect. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm thirsty, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It's okay. 
          
                         VICNENT
          I know you, Mel. You won't be happy with 
          less than perfect. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Today I will. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I can't get the straw part, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't even wanna think about what's 
          gonna happen to my life if I don't have 
          that model by two this afternoon. 
          
                         VICNENT
          All right, then. I'll give it a try. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thanks. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. Now, while I'm doing my 
          column, you need to think of about the 
          six hundred fun things to do, 'cause the 
          rest of the day is yours. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I already know, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          Uh-huh. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I wanna go to the zoo, and go for a 
          carriage ride and to the Carrousel and 
          to the National Museum of History, and 
          visit the Cats. 
          
                         JACK
          No, it's Cats. Not the Cats. 
          
                         WOMAN 1
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey. 
          
                         WOMAN 2
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, Jackson. 
          
                         WOMAN 3
          I never knew you had a daughter. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, this is Maggie. 
          
                         WOMAN 3
          She's so cute. She looks just like you. 
          
                         JACK
          She'll grow out of it. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          How come all the girls are talking to 
          you like that? 
          
                         JACK
          What are you talking about? Like what? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hiii, Jaack. 
          
                         CELIA
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, Celia. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          See, Dad? See? 
          
                         CELIA
          Oh! You know, Jack, I'm doing a story on 
          men like you. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, yeah? What's the hook? 
          
                         CELIA
          Oh, just a little expression my mother 
          used to use
          "Love your guy like a little boy, and 
          he'll grow into a man." 
          
                         LEW
          Jack! Get in here! 
          
                         JACK
          Fish. You're not gonna believe the 
          morning that I have had already. What's 
          the matter with you? You look cranky. 
          You back on that diet again? Honey, you 
          remember Lew? 
          
                         LEW
          Yeah. Maybe we haven't seen each other 
          for a long time. I am cranky, Jack. And 
          I have a very good breakfast this 
          morning. We're in big trouble on your 
          garbage story. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, God. 
          
                         LEW
          Wait a minute, honey. I want to show you 
          something. 
          
                         JACK
          It's okay. Go ahead. 
          
                         LEW
          Now, this is Lois Lane. She lives here 
          in the newsroom. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Wow. 
          
                         LEW
          Wanna pet her, sweetheart? Go ahead. She 
          won't bite. You got this raging scoop 
          disease, my friend. 
          
                         JACK
          Which is what you love about me. 
          
                         LEW
          Why don't you stay here and play with 
          the kitty, honey? Me and your daddy 
          gonna have a little talk, all right? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         LEW
          That's a girl. Let's go. 
          
                         JACK
          Now, would you rather that I wasn't 
          first? 
          
                         LEW
          I'd rather you were right. 
          
                         JACK
          I am right. 
          
                         LEW
          Okay. Who told you that the Mayor's re-
          election campaign were taking illegal 
          contributions from the Mob? 
          
                         JACK
          Manny Feldstein. 
          
                         LEW
          Manny Feldstein told you on the record 
          that the Newark-based trucking company 
          of Grace & Marr, a well-known Mob front, 
          was made an illegal contribution to 
          Mayor Aikens' re-election campaign. 
          
                         JACK
          That's right. On the record. 
          
                         LEW
          In exchange for receiving the city's 
          sanitation contract. 
          
                         JACK
          On the record. 
          
                         LEW
          Which were awarded without bidding. 
          
                         JACK
          Through Grace & Marr. That's right. On 
          the record. 
          
                         LEW
          Manny Feldstein's gonna say he never 
          talked to you! 
          
                         JACK
          What? What? Hey, what? 
          
                         LEW
          During the Mayor's press conference 
          today, Manny Feldstein's gonna say you 
          made the whole thing up. You didn't make 
          it up, did you, Jack? 
          
                         JACK
          Of course not, Lew. Manny told me that 
          he saw the campaign accounts. 
          
                         LEW
          Where's Metro? 
          
                         JACK
          Deposited in unnumbered accounts-- 
          
                         LEW
          Freddy, here. 
          
                         JACK
          Unnumbered. 
          
                         LEW
          The whole page, we may have to print a 
          retraction. 
          
                         FREDDY
          Of what? 
          
                         LEW
          Get back in there. You know, you're 
          gonna give me an ulcer. I can feel it. 
          It's like I swallowed a car battery. Why 
          couldn't you get two sources on this 
          story? 
          
                         JACK
          Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story? 
          
                         LEW
          You know how close we came to getting 
          fired on that story? 
          
                         JACK
          I almost got the Pulitzer Prize on that. 
          
                         LEW
          It's real simple, Jack. Management just 
          doesn't wanna clean up after you 
          anymore. Not now! 
          
                         JACK
          I'm a good reporter, Lew. 
          
                         LEW
          No. You are a great reporter, but 
          sometimes you just get too excited, and 
          then you get me too excited. And now 
          I've given you enough rope to hang us 
          both. And, Jack, nobody almost gets a 
          Pulitzer Prize. 
          
                         WOMAN
          Jack, I-- 
          
                         JACK
          One second. They're not gonna fire me, 
          Lew. My pictures are on buses. 
          
                         LEW
          That's what I said. Then they asked me 
          to have lunch with Frank Burroughs. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Um, Dad? 
          
                         JACK
          Frank Burroughs? 
          
                         LEW
          "Frankly Speaking" is a very popular 
          column. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hey, Dad. 
          
                         JACK
          Frank Burroughs is a pompous, arrogant, 
          humorless asshole. 
          
                         LEW
          Who's won the Pulitzer Prize. 
          
                         JACK
          You know, you know something, Lew? I'm 
          not gonna lose my job, all right? I got 
          alimony and shrink bills, I got all the 
          colleague loans to repay. I got-- One 
          second. I have a-a plumbing situation. 
          Okay? Now, Manny has been my guy all 
          year long. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Dad! 
          
                         JACK
          One second, darling. I played bridge 
          with his mother. I took his niece to 
          Cirque du Soleil. Just one second. I had 
          to sit through him playing Tevye in-in 
          dinner theater, Lew. Dinner theater! 
          
                         LEW
          Jack, I gave you this column, and I love 
          you like a son, but I can't cover for 
          you anymore. Now, you've got less than 
          six hours to that press conference, and 
          no other leads, we've gotta get 
          Feldstein back on the record or find 
          another reliable source to confirm this 
          whole goddamn thing. Otherwise, we're 
          printing a retraction. And I guarantee 
          you, Jack, it'll be your last. 
          
                         JACK
          That's fine. All right. If you need me, 
          I'm at a different number today. 
          
                         LEW
          Now where are you going? 
          
                         JACK
          To find Manny. 
          
                         LEW
          Take care of yourself, kid. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, I will. 
          
                         CELIA
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         CELIA
          Listen, um, I really wanted to say 
          something, to you, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Right. 
          
                         CELIA
          I've noticed that you haven't been 
          dating for quite a while. 
          
                         JACK
          Right. 
          
                         CELIA
          Actually, we've all noticed. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, here we go. Hi. 
          
                         MAN
          Hi. 
          
                         CELIA
          I know that you're sensitive, but 
          frightened. I'm gentle, but brutal. 
          Think about it. Think about me, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          I will. 
          
                         CELIA
          Mmm. Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          Brutal. 
          
                         JACK
          Marla? Marla, hey! Have you seen my 
          daughter? Have you seen Maggie? 
          
                         MARLA
          Uh, no. No, I haven't. 
          
                         JACK
          No? Excuse me, please. 
          
                         JACK
          Have you seen my daughter? No? Uh, 
          Maggie? Aw, damn it! 
          
                         WOMAN
          Hey, Jack. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          "Hi, Daddy"? Do you do this with your 
          mother? This "wandering off" thing? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          'Cause it's not a good thing to do. Now 
          listen, I gotta go talk to a guy 
          downtown. It's kind of a tricky thing 
          and I only have one shot at it, which 
          means... 
          
                         MAGGIE
          That I can't come? 
          
                         JACK
          That's right. You can't come. Now, what 
          am I gonna do with ya? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Look, this is incredibly difficult for 
          me, but you're absolutely the last 
          person I could think of to ask. I'm 
          really in a bind. I could lose my job. I 
          know you're recording, but -- can you 
          hold on a minute? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I know you're recording, but it would 
          just be for an hour. From two to three. 
          Come on, Eddie, you're his father. Fine, 
          never mind. I'll think of something. Are 
          you at least coming to his soccer game? 
          Six. It would mean a lot to him. 
          
                         VICNENT
          Ah! Mel! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy! Sammy, get off of that! Get off 
          of it. Time out! Get-- 
          
                         MELANIE
          What is the matter with you? You almost 
          broke it again! Why can't you just play 
          quietly and not get into trouble for 
          five minutes? Don't you realize how 
          important this is? That's it. I'm taking 
          you to the 9th Street Drop-In Center. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I don't wanna go there, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Too bad. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Those kids will beat me. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, they won't. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yes, they will. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, you'll just have to be really 
          brave, then. Vincent, I'll be back in an 
          hour to pick up the model! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Now when the little hand gets 
          between the four and the five, that's 
          4:30. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I'm sorry. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Honey, honey. You're not being punished. 
          I'll be back and then we can go to your 
          soccer game. 
          
                         SAMMY
          But that's too long. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sweetheart, I set the alarm and you'll 
          wear it, and I'll be here for you by the 
          time it goes off. I promise. Come on. 
          
                         SAMMY
          But I don't wanna go in there, Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          But it'll be fun. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Look, it's Super Hero Day! Hey! Spider-
          Man! 
          
                         SPIDER-MAN
          He can't come in here. He's not a Super 
          Hero! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, yeah? You guys sure about that? 
          
                         THE HULK
          He doesn't look like one. 
          
                         SPIDER-MAN
          He looks like a poo-poo cry baby. 
          
                         PUPPET
          When the big hand gets to, uh, there, 
          and the little hand gets to, uh, there, 
          then... 
          
                         MAGGIE
          You'll be back. 
          
                         PUPPET
          Ah! Wait a minute. 
          
                         PUPPET
          Easy, isn't it? Hang on. Come on. Now 
          you're wearing daddy's watch. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          But I don't have a costume. 
          
                         PUPPET
          Costume? Uh, okay, how about, uh, Bessie 
          the Choreographer? Huh! 5, 6, 7, 8-- 
          Moo! Moo. 
          
                         JACK
          I don't have, you know, I don't-- I got-
          - I don't have a costume. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh! 
          
                         JACK
          Hey. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hey, Maggie! Look, honey! Maggie! 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi, Sammy. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Hi, Maggie. 
          
                         JACK
          I thought you told your sister that you 
          weren't gonna bring him here. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, I got desperate. 
          
                         JACK
          Me too. 
          
                         MELANIE
          So, looks like we need two Super Heros 
          and fast. 
          
                         JACK
          Mm-hmm. 
          
                         JACK
          W-Where'd you get a bag like that? 
          
                         MELANIE
          If those mean boys give you any more 
          trouble, first go to the teacher. If she 
          doesn't help, call me on the mobile. If 
          you can't reach me, call 911. 
          
                         JACK
          Just kick the mean boys in the shins. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Bye! 
          
                         JACK
          Good-bye! 
          
                         JACK
          Thanks for doing that. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sure. Hard enough being a kid. 
          
                         JACK
          It is excellent. 
          
                         MELANIE
          And you would know. 
          
                         JACK
          What about? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Nothing. 
          
                         JACK
          Know what my mother used to say to me? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Gee, no. 
          
                         JACK
          "Love your guy like a little boy and 
          he'll grow into a man." 
          
                         MELANIE
          Huh? 
          
                         JACK
          "Love your guy like a little boy and 
          he'll grow into a man." 
          
                         MELANIE
          She knew back then that you were gay? 
          
                         JACK
          I'm not gay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Then why did she advise you on how guys 
          wanna be loved? Taxi! 
          
                         JACK
          Maybe she was hoping I'd meet a woman 
          like that someday. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know, I really can't stand those 
          people who blame their worst traits on 
          everyone but themselves. It's so 90s. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, God, what are you talking about? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You're blaming your Peter Pan complex on 
          your mother? 
          
                         JACK
          What Peter Pan complex? 
          
                         MELANIE
          The one you're so proud of. 
          
                         JACK
          You got any friends? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't have time for friends. 
          
                         JACK
          That's because of your Captain Hook 
          complex. 
          
                         MELANIE
          My what? 
          
                         JACK
          Captain Hook complex. 
          
                         MELANIE
          There's no such thing. 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, there is and you have it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Here's your phone back. 
          
                         JACK
          Here's yours. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thank you! 
          
                         JACK
          Manny! Hey! Feldstein. Hey. 
          
                         MANNY
          I can't be with you right now, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Manny! Excuse me. 
          
                         JACK
          Manny! Hey, Manny! Arggh! Manny! Hey, 
          Manny. 
          
                         MANNY
          Please, just don't hit me. 
          
                         JACK
          I'm not gonna hit you. Now, what's going 
          on? 
          
                         MANNY
          I've been having thoughts. 
          
                         JACK
          We already had our thoughts. 
          
                         MANNY
          Please don't yell at me. You're very 
          emotional. 
          
                         JACK
          You were the one who said to me this 
          garbage thing stinks. 
          
                         MANNY
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          Now, I've waited for a month for you to 
          get comfortable with this. You get 
          comfortable with this, we print the 
          story, it runs on the front page, and 
          now you are telling me that you are 
          having thoughts. What is the matter with 
          you? 
          
                         MANNY
          I've been having some trouble with a 
          dose of my medication. The thing is, you 
          get the dose, you get drunk, you get a 
          little grandiose. We were talking about 
          taking down the Mayor and the Mob 
          together, right? 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, that's right. 
          
                         MANNY
          That's crazy. 
          
                         JACK
          No, it's not. 
          
                         MANNY
          I'm telling you it is. Now that I'm a 
          little better regulated, I realize they 
          definitely will kill me! 
          
                         JACK
          Manny, come here. Come here. Hey, listen 
          to me. All right. Don't do this to me, 
          all right? Look at me. Hey, I'm the one 
          who started your standing ovation for 
          "If I Were A Rich Man", right? 
          
                         MANNY
          I can't do it. 
          
                         JACK
          You can do it. You're my guy. 
          
                         MANNY
          I got a wife and a family. I'm their 
          guy, too. You're hurting my neck. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. All right. 
          
                         MANNY
          I'm sorry, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, give me the... give me a name. 
          
                         MANNY
          I can't think of any names. 
          
                         JACK
          Think of a name. Give me a name. Whose 
          name is on the account? 
          
                         MANNY
          I don't know. I only saw numbers. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. Who set up the account? 
          
                         MANNY
          I don't-- 
          
                         JACK
          Give me a name. Who set up the account, 
          Manny? 
          
                         MANNY
          I don't know. Eddie McCoy, maybe. 
          
                         JACK
          Maybe Eddie McCoy. Eddie-- how... You 
          know what? I'm gonna figure it out 
          myself. Okay, Manny? Thanks. Thank you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hello? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          What happened? 
          
                         SAMMY
          I don't wanna stay here anymore and 
          neither does Maggie. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sweetie, you're gonna have to stay 
          there. Just for a little while 
          
                         SAMMY
          Ooh! 
          
                         MELANIE
          What happened? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Spider-Man kicked me and She-ra took 
          Maggie's snack. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Let me talk to the teacher. 
          
                         SAMMY
          He's outside talking to The Hulk about 
          not using the "F" word. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy, you're just gonna have to be 
          tough and brave and wait-- 
          
                         SAMMY
          What's LSD? 
          
                         MELANIE
          LSD? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Spider-Man was talking to Maggie about 
          LSD that he got from his brother. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Don't move. Stay right where you are. 
          You'll both be picked up in ten minutes. 
          
                         JACK
          No, Manny's a dead end. 
          
                         LEW
          Did he give you anything? 
          
                         JACK
          Eddie McCoy probably set up the account. 
          
                         LEW
          No, he's the campaign manger. He 
          wouldn't implicate himself. So? 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, city comptroller. 
          
                         LEW
          He'll never talk. 
          
                         JACK
          What about the Sanitation Commissioner? 
          
                         LEW
          Lieberman? Metro! 
          
                         METRO
          Yeah. 
          
                         LEW
          How do we get ahold of Lieberman? 
          
                         METRO
          Lieberman's in Barbados. 
          
                         LEW
          Lieberman's in Barbados. 
          
                         JACK
          The Sanitation Commissioner is in 
          Barbados? 
          
                         LEW
          In the middle of a garbage scandal. 
          
                         JACK
          Maybe the Mayor wanted him out of town. 
          
                         LEW
          Metro! 
          
                         METRO
          What? 
          
                         LEW
          What's Lieberman doing in Barbados? 
          
                         METRO
          He's there with his new girlfriend. 
          
                         LEW
          He's there with his new girlfriend. 
          
                         JACK
          Which leaves his very angry wife. 
          
                         LEW
          Bingo! 
          
                         JACK
          I'm in the lobby. I'll be right up. Huh. 
          Here we go. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Jack, it's Melanie Parker. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey. 
          
                         MELANIE
          We have a major problem with our kids. 
          They're okay, but they can't stay there. 
          They have to be picked up right now. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Can you do it? 
          
                         JACK
          Me? Now? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I would definitely jeopardize my career 
          and by extension, my entire life if I 
          picked them up now. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, I would definitely jeopardize my 
          career and by extension, my entire life 
          if I picked them up now. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay, but your press conference isn't 
          until five, right? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         MELANIE
          My presentation is at two. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay, I've got to see this lady Elaine 
          Lieberman about some information I need. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Couldn't you do that on the phone? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, I-- 
          
                         MELANIE
          Great. 
          
                         JACK
          Well, is there anybody else you could 
          call? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I wouldn't be asking you if there were 
          anyone else I could call. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Look, how about if I watch them both 
          from, say, three o'clock until your 
          press conference ends if you'll watch 
          them both from now until three? 
          
                         JACK
          You're asking me for help? 
          
                         MELANIE
          It would appear that way, wouldn't it? 
          
                         JACK
          I'll agree if you say, "Jack, please be 
          my Knight in Shining Armor." 
          
                         MELANIE
          Jack, don't be a shithead. Go rescue our 
          kids. 
          
                         JACK
          This is hard for you, isn't it? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Are you agreeing or not? 
          
                         JACK
          You know, you're not the only one with a 
          day. I've got a day, too. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sorry. I'll meet you and the kids in my 
          office lobby at Rockefeller Center at 
          3:15. 
          
                         JACK
          Fine. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Fine. 
          
                         JACK
          Marla, tell Celia to get Elaine 
          Lieberman's home number and call me on 
          my cell phone. 
          
                         MARLA
          No, uh-- 
          
                         JACK
          What? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I forgot to tell you that Sammy is 
          allergic to shellfish and dander, and 
          also he's not allowed to watch 
          commercial TV, and no matter what he 
          says, he has to hold your hand when he 
          crosses the street. Oh, and also if you 
          go to the playground, I like to check 
          the sandbox first. You never know what 
          people throw in there. And als-- uh... 
          Okay. Bye. 
          
                         JACK
          Fine. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Fine. 
          
                         JACK
          Hello? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hi, it's me. 
          
                         JACK
          Me who? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You have the kids? 
          
                         JACK
          What kids? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You didn't pick up the kids? 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, you mean those kids. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Look, I was just calling-- 
          
                         JACK
          You just wanted to call and check up on 
          me because you don't really trust me. 
          Sammy! Sammy, no. Put the gun down. And 
          you only asked me to watch Sammy out of 
          sheer desperation. Part of you would 
          feel safer with him at the 9th Street 
          Drop-In Center with LSD. Isn't that 
          true? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, that is not true. I only wanted to 
          warn you that Sammy can get into trouble 
          faster than you can make most women 
          smile. 
          
                         JACK
          Are you flirting with me? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Would you please just really pay 
          attention to him? 
          
                         JACK
          I won't let him out of my sight. Sammy! 
          Hey, guns aren't toys. It's not loaded. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Good-bye. 
          
                         JACK
          Sammy, how long have your Mom and Dad 
          been divorced? 
          
                         SAMMY
          I don't know. It doesn't matter really, 
          because she said she'll always love him. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah? Hey, what's that? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Marble. 
          
                         JACK
          That's a marble. That's what that is. 
          You get to see your Dad a lot? Come 
          here. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yeah, pretty much, usually. He has a 
          different schedule than a lot of other 
          dads. He's a drummer. His favorite thing 
          to do is watch me play soccer. He's 
          probably coming today. And he's taking 
          me fishing this whole summer. Just us. 
          And maybe Mom will come, too. 
          
                         JACK
          Your dad's a drummer, huh? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yep. 
          
                         JACK
          Sounds like a great guy, Sammy. 
          
                         SAMMY
          He is. 
          
                         LELAND
          Kurt, Jake, you remember Melanie Parker? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Nice to see you. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          Nice to see you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Nice to see you. Well, voila'. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          I love this. This is -- What is this? 
          
                         YATES JR.
          A vaulted, um-- 
          
                         MELANIE
          A vaulted pediment. Vaulted pediment. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          I love that. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah? 
          
                         YATES SR.
          But I need to see this with cars. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          You don't need cars, Dad. Just use your 
          imagination. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          My imagination? I have to see it with 
          the cars. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Cars. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Ahem. See? 
          
                         YATES SR.
          She's quite a little discovery. 
          
                         LELAND
          Yes, she is. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Why don't you join us for drinks this 
          evening? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Let's say, 5:30 at the 21. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I--Oh, I don't know if I can. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          What? We'll talk about this project. 
          From what I've seen, you could bring a 
          great deal to this. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'll be there. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Terrific. That's great.

          Spring Spa Day?

          Okay?

          Uh, Elizabeth Arden? Excellent.

          Dad! 
          
                         JACK
          What? You guys are being a-- Oh, man. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          You're so stupid. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Am not. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Are so. You ruined my Dad's marble. He's 
          not gonna want it with your snot all 
          over it. 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, I will. I'll just wash it off. 
          You're gonna be fine. The doctor's just 
          gonna pop that thing right out of there. 
          
                         SAMMY
          How come you couldn't do it? 
          
                         JACK
          Well, you know, that's a little nose, 
          big marble. But, see, the doctor, he's 
          gonna have this-this clamp thing that's 
          gonna come up and just yank it right 
          out. And you're gonna be fine. You've 
          just gotta not worry about it, and 
          you've gotta not think about it. You've 
          gotta think about something else. You've 
          gotta think about...

          This is Celia. I'm a friend of Jack's. 
          And who's this? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Absolutely nobody. 
          
                         CELIA
          Whatever, could you please tell him that 
          Kristen just called from the Bahamas to 
          let him know her number there? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh-huh. 
          
                         CELIA
          And this is very important. Elaine 
          Lieberman will only be at Elizabeth 
          Arden's until 3:30. So if you could pass 
          on those messages, we'd both appreciate 
          it. 
          
                         JACK
          Your mom is gonna kill me if I don't 
          have you guys in the lobby by 3:15 on 
          the dot. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I don't think she'll kill ya. She's not 
          like that, really. 
          
                         JACK
          She isn't? 
          
                         SAMMY
          No. She just acts tough and mean, 'cause 
          she'd rather be safe than sorry. 
          
                         JACK
          What does that mean? 
          
                         SAMMY
          She just says it a lot when men try to 
          open her door and stuff. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah? Whup! Excuse us! Go, go, go, go, 
          go, go, go, go, go, go. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hi, you guys! 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, hey. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Um, your friend, uh, Celia, called to 
          tell you -- Sammy! 
          
                         JACK
          It's okay, only an escalator. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, that Kristen called you from the 
          Bahamas and also that Elaine Lie-- um... 
          
                         JACK
          Lieberman. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Lieberman will be at Elizabeth Arden's 
          until 3:30. 
          
                         JACK
          Great. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thank you so much for watching Sammy. 
          Really. You, you saved my life. Was he 
          any trouble? 
          
                         JACK
          No. Nah, not at all. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Good. So everything worked out great. I 
          was sure you were going to either show 
          up three hours late or not at all. 
          
                         JACK
          Guess what? I'm not like every other man 
          you know. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. I realize that. I was just kidding. 
          
                         JACK
          No, you weren't, but... 
          
                         MELANIE
          Guess what? I'm not like every other 
          woman you know. 
          
                         JACK
          Really? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. You probably think I'm a real 
          control freak, and I'm not at all. Well, 
          I mean, I do like things the way I like 
          them, but who doesn't? And anyway, in my 
          life, I'm the only one who ever does 
          anything, so, uh, what does it matter? 
          
                         JACK
          Maybe you should let somebody help you 
          out every once in a while. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Definitely not. I've got all of these 
          little balls up in the air. And if 
          somebody else caught one for me, I'd 
          drop them all. 
          
                         JACK
          But you're not a control freak? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. I'm a single working mother. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. I have more work to do than time 
          to do it. So before you and I get into 
          yet another, uh, lengthy and exhausting 
          "thing", I have a career to save, okay? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Do you, do you, do you have any 
          instructions for me before you-- 
          
                         JACK
          No, no. I trust you completely. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I-I-I don't suppose you could, um, you 
          could switch your thing from 5:00 to, 
          say, 4:30, because I just found out that 
          I have a new thing at 5:30. 
          
                         JACK
          Can't switch my thing. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'll switch mine. No problem. 
          
                         JACK
          See you guys at the soccer game. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Bye, Dad! 
          
                         SAMMY
          Bye, Jack! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thanks again, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          You're welcome. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I-I realize it's difficult what with, 
          uh, Celia, Kristen, Elaine. 
          
                         JACK
          I know your name, Mel. 
          
                         MELANIE
          So what did you guys do with Jack? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Quit kicking me, Maggie. I wasn't gonna 
          say anything about -- 
          
                         MELANIE
          About what? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Nothing. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          It's a secret. We're not supposed to 
          say. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Secret about what? About your dad? 
          
                         SAMMY
          And you too, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Me too? Come on, you guys. Tell. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Secret about me and Jack. Hmm. Does it 
          have anything to do with feelings? 
          
                         SAMMY
          What do you mean? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know, feelings. Like being scared or 
          hurt or-or-or-or-or happy and excited. 
          You know, those are -- those are 
          feelings. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Definitely about feelings, then. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. Definitely. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Switch. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Sorry, Mom. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It's okay, honey. So, what'd you get? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Frozen hot chocolate. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Mmm. Yum. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          You like chocolate? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I love chocolate. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Daddy told Dr. Martin this morning that 
          he's got deep, dark chocolate inside of 
          him. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Really? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          And that he'd like to meet a fish who 
          wasn't afraid of his dark chocolate 
          layer. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I think I'm beginning to guess the 
          secret. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Are you mad? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Not really. I think he should have 
          talked about it with me, though. 
          
                         SAMMY
          He was afraid you'd hate him. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Of course, I wouldn't hate him. 
          Honestly, that is so silly. 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, you don't understand. This is an 
          emergency. 
          
                         RUTA
          I don't interrupt Mrs. Lieberman during 
          her bikini wax. 
          
                         JACK
          Now, listen. 
          
                         RUTA
          Don't bother with the cute face. I have 
          five sons. You make eyes at me like 
          that, I make you pot roast. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         RUTA
          Oh, excuse me. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         RUTA
          Hello, Mrs. Kempner. Let me get your 
          robe. 
          
                         WOMAN
          Good-bye, Mrs. Lieberman. 
          
                         ELAINE
          Next week. 
          
                         WOMAN
          Yes, indeed. 
          
                         ELAINE
          Down, please. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, uh, is Mrs. Lieberman here? Here? 
          No? Okay. Hi. Hey, hi. Hi, hi, hi. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, uh, is Mrs. Lieberman, Elaine 
          Lieberman in here, by any chance? Hi, 
          it's okay. I'm sorry. 
          
                         JACK
          Hi. Um, I'm looking for Elaine 
          Lieberman. 
          
                         RITA
          She just left. 
          
                         JACK
          Thank you. 
          
                         RITA
          Jack? 
          
                         JACK
          Yep? 
          
                         RITA
          Is that you? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         RITA
          It's Rita! 
          
                         JACK
          Who? 
          
                         RITA
          Melanie's mother. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, Rita. Hey! 
          
                         RITA
          Do you--Sorry. Do you believe what a 
          small world? 
          
                         JACK
          I know, I just spent the whole afternoon 
          with your grandson. 
          
                         RITA
          Yeah. He's cute, but he's a handful. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, I'm just trying to catch up with 
          Elaine Lieberman. 
          
                         RITA
          Li-Listen, I just want to tell you one 
          thing about my daughter, and it's 
          something that you may suspect, though. 
          She can make you want to scream like 
          you're having a body wax. I mean, she's 
          that frustrating. 
          
                         JACK
          Mm-hmm. Yeah. 
          
                         RITA
          Inside, Jack, she's mush. 
          
                         JACK
          Mush. 
          
                         RITA
          So you scream all you want, but just 
          don't run away too soon. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. All right. 
          
                         RITA
          Okay, bye-bye. You're adorable. 
          
                         JACK
          Mrs. Lieberman? Where is she? Yeah? 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, Mrs. Lieberman! Mrs. Lieberman! 
          Mrs. Lieberman! Jack Taylor, Daily News! 
          
                         ELAINE
          Get in. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, all right. Listen. Hey, hey. 
          
                         JACK
          I'm glad I finally found you. I have to 
          ask you kind of a difficult question. 
          
                         ELAINE
          About my husband? 
          
                         JACK
          I don't know how much you know about his 
          business affairs. 
          
                         ELAINE
          You are referring to the illegal 
          account? 
          
                         JACK
          So you know about that? 
          
                         ELAINE
          It's in his name. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         ELAINE
          I have the deposit slips. 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, I don't suppose you'd be willing to 
          go-- 
          
                         ELAINE
          Go on the record? 
          
                         JACK
          I know it's a lot to ask. 
          
                         ELAINE
          Elaine Lieberman. E-L-A-I-N-E L-I-E-B-E-
          R-M-A-N. I only have one request. 
          
                         JACK
          Anything at all. 
          
                         ELAINE
          Fax him a copy in Barbados. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hello? 
          
                         RITA
          Hi, darling. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Mom, thank God. I-I'm in big trouble. I-
          I have to have drinks with clients at 
          5:30, or I'll be fired and I have 
          absolutely no childcare. What time are 
          you done at Elizabeth Arden's? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sammy! Put that down. Honey, you're 
          gonna break it. 
          
                         RITA
          You only think about work. What about 
          personal life? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Actually, Mom, today I thought a lot 
          about my personal life. D-Don't laugh. I 
          did. I'm serious. I-- 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Come here, kitty, kitty-kitty. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Kitty? Kitty. Kitty? 
          
                         MELANIE
          What do you mean, don't be my usual self 
          with him? I don't think my usual self 
          could be all that bad since I'm pretty 
          sure Jack just told the kids he has 
          feelings for me. He wants to ask me out 
          on a date. 
          
                         RITA
          Divine. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie? Sammy, where's Maggie? Take that 
          out of your nose. What is the matter 
          with you? Excuse me. I'm-- the thing is, 
          I'm, I think I, I could have feelings 
          for him too. Or at least I think I might 
          be able to, which is, you know, it's a 
          big step up for me. Mom, could you hold 
          on a minute? Maggie? 
          
                         RITA
          Well, you know, I had no idea from that 
          floating head on top of his column that 
          he was so tall and he's got that good 
          color in his skin, which you also 
          couldn't tell from the black and white 
          photo. He really is altogether yummy, 
          Mel. 
          
                         MELANIE
          And how would you know? 
          
                         RITA
          Because he was just here, darling. 
          
                         MELANIE
          This isn't some horrifyingly elaborate, 
          matchmaking scheme, is it, Mom? Maggie! 
          
                         RITA
          Of course not, darling. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie! Oh, my God. I just lost his 
          daughter! 
          
                         RITA
          You lost his daughter? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie! Maggie! Oh, my God! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl? 
          Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you seen a 
          little girl? She's about six years old, 
          and she's wearing-- Excuse me, sir. Have 
          you seen a little girl? Maggie! 
          
                         MAN
          No, sorry. 
          
                         MELANIE
          She's about six-- 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me. Excuse me. Have you seen a 
          little girl? She's about six. Maggie! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Have you seen a little girl? She's about 
          six years old. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl? 
          Excuse me. Have you seen a lost little 
          girl? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Maggie! Maggie! 
          
                         OLD WOMAN
          Well, hello. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hi. 
          
                         OFFICER
          Is there anything else you can tell us, 
          Ms. Parker? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't think so. I just-- He's still 
          not answering. I-I-I just can't believe, 
          I can't believe this happened. One 
          minute she was there, and then the next-
          - 
          
                         OFFICER
          I understand that. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, you don't understand. I just met 
          this guy this morning and I was horrible 
          to him all day! 
          
                         WOMAN
          Excuse me. 
          
                         OFFICER
          You're shivering. Jimmy, get her a coat! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Why did I have to be so horrible to him? 
          I called him immature and uncharming and 
          irresponsible. And I was my usual self. 
          She said-- 
          
                         WOMAN
          (inaudible) ... now please. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me! But I've lost a little girl! 
          I'm sorry. She said, "Don't be your 
          usual self", but I was my usual self. 
          And he took perfect care of my son for 
          me while I did my presentation which 
          went very well, then I lost his 
          daughter! How could I have done that? 
          
                         OFFICER
          It probably wasn't your fault. 
          
                         MELANIE
          And I didn't even pay my bill from 
          Serendipity's. 
          
                         WOMAN
          Do you mind? 
          
                         MAN
          Is that your mom? 
          
                         JACK
          Mrs. Lieberman. Elaine, you have saved 
          my life. Watch your hand. 
          
                         JACK
          That was smart. 
          
                         MAN
          Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Mike. 
          
                         JACK
          I love you, Lew. I love this town. I 
          love this job. I love Elaine Lieberman. 
          
                         LEW
          That's a lot of love for you, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          I got to tell you something. I met 
          someone today. 
          
                         LEW
          What are you talking about? 
          
                         JACK
          I don't know how to describe her. 
          She's... she's luminous. Her face is-- 
          
                         LEW
          You're talking about women. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         LEW
          Your ass is on the line and you're 
          talking about women? You nuts? 
          
                         JACK
          That is under control. I have Elaine 
          Lieberman on the record and she has 
          proof of a campaign account. 
          
                         LEW
          Elaine Lieberman's an angry wife. All 
          her husband's got to do is her some kind 
          of sorry-gram, and she's off the record. 
          
                         JACK
          You have my word. 
          
                         LEW
          Your word means nothing to management. 
          You better make sure that Elaine 
          Lieberman gets to that press conference 
          this afternoon. Either she confronts the 
          Mayor directly, or I'm gonna have to 
          print a retraction. 
          
                         JACK
          Don't worry. Elaine's my girl. 
          
                         LEW
          I hope so, Jack. Jack? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         LEW
          I just had lunch with Frank Burroughs. 
          Very bright. Very funny. Very humble 
          man. 
          
                         JACK
          You love me, Lew. You know you do. 
          
                         LEW
          Yeah. Come on, Lois. Come on. That's it. 
          
                         MARLA
          Hey, Lew! Lew, where's Jack? 
          
                         LEW
          On the way to City Hall. 
          
                         MARLA
          But I have a ton of urgent messages for 
          him. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I can't sit here like this. I got to go 
          find Jack. He's gonna be at City Hall in 
          fifteen minutes. Come on, honey. 
          
                         JACK
          Uh-huh, five o'clock. That's great. Hang 
          on! Yes, Elaine? Excuse me one second. 
          City Hall, please. Look, I can't thank 
          you enough. 
          
                         ELAINE
          Uh, Dwayne. Please, City Hall. Look, 
          I'll do my best to get there on time, 
          Jack. I was just on my way to Staten 
          Island, so I might be a couple of 
          minutes late. All right? 
          
                         ELAINE
          Dwayne, hurry up! 
          
                         JACK
          Hello? 
          
                         LIEUTENANT
          Mr. Taylor? Lieutenant Bonomo, 18th 
          Precinct. We found your daughter. 
          
                         JACK
          What? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Excuse me. You haven't seen Jack Taylor 
          anywhere, have you? 
          
                         REPORTER
          No, I haven't. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, excuse me? I'm sorry, but you don't 
          happen to know Jack Taylor, do you? 
          
                         CELIA
          Very well, in fact. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You're Celia, aren't you? 
          
                         CELIA
          Yes. And you must be the one who lost 
          his little girl. 
          
                         JACK
          Hello, Maggie! 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Daddy! 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, hi! 
          
                         OLD WOMAN
          Hello. 
          
                         JACK
          Hi, I'm Jack Taylor. That's mine over 
          there. Thank you very much for watching 
          her. 
          
                         OLD WOMAN
          Well, it was my pleasure. 
          
                         JACK
          I'm sure it was. Come on. We got to 
          hurry. Come on. Let's go. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No, Daddy. I wanna play with the 
          kitties. 
          
                         JACK
          There's no time to play with the 
          kitties. We got to go to a press 
          conference. Hi, kitties. How are you? 
          Come on. Let's go. Tag, you're it. Come 
          on, chase me. Let's go, Maggie. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No, Daddy. I wanna play with the 
          kitties. 
          
                         JACK
          Come on. Red light, green light. Come 
          on, come on. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Stop it! 
          
                         JACK
          Come on. Let's go. Maggie, come on. 
          Don't do this right now. Don't you 
          understand? If I don't get there, 
          Maggie-- Want me to lose my job? Come 
          on, come here. Watch your head. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No, stop it! 
          
                         JACK
          Do you want me to lose my job? 
          
                         JACK
          You really love those kittens, right? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          Come on. Come here. Watch your head. 
          There. Okay. So what are their names? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          This one is Bob, 'cause he looks like a 
          Bobcat. And that one's Fred. And that 
          one's -- I forget this one's name. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Okay. Listen, Maggie. I know this 
          has been a rotten day for you. And I 
          know that right now all you wanna do is 
          play with these kittens. I don't blame 
          you, 'cause they're great. But if I 
          don't get to this press conference, I'm 
          gonna lose my job. And I don't wanna 
          lose my job. So we got to work something 
          out for you and me. Some kind of a deal 
          here, so... What if we talk to this 
          beautiful young lady and we ask her if 
          maybe Bob can come to the press 
          conference with us? 
          
                         OLD WOMAN
          Mm-hmm. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          You mean keep him? 
          
                         JACK
          Borrow him. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          But I wanna keep him. 
          
                         JACK
          You'll have to talk to your mother about 
          that. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          She's allergic. 
          
                         JACK
          That's right. She gets all... right. All 
          right. Um, well, you know what? Bob can 
          just stay at my house. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Where would he sleep? 
          
                         JACK
          You know that, uh, the room with all the 
          box in it? We could clear those out. He 
          could sleep in there. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          That's a good idea. 
          
                         JACK
          Of course, you know, you're gonna have 
          to come over and visit even once in a 
          while just to check up and make sure 
          that, you know, I'm feeding him and 
          everything. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I will. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Come here. 
          
                         JACK
          You know, maybe, uh, maybe what we 
          oughta do is put a bed in that room for 
          you, too. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. 'Cause he might get lonely. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, he's not gona get lonely with you 
          there. Come here, let me take a look at 
          this guy. So this is gonna be our cat, 
          huh? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Bob. 
          
                         JACK
          Bob. Yeah. All right. Now, can we get 
          out of here already? Yeah? 
          
                         CELIA
          Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

          Mr. Burroughs. 
          
                         FRANK
          Mr. Mayor, do you plan to sue Jack 
          Taylor and the Daily News for the 
          apparently false and certainly 
          unsubstantiated charges they've made 
          against you? 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Say, that's not a bad idea. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Hey, Dad. That guy's on the bus, too. 
          
                         JACK
          Would you hurry, please? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          He has a bigger picture than yours. 
          
                         JACK
          Do you speak English? 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Last question, please. 
          
                         JACK
          Excuse me! Excuse me. 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Last question, please.

                         SAMMY
          Mom, what are you doing? You're not a 
          reporter. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I got to do something. Mr. Mayor! Mr. 
          Mayor! 
          
                         SAMMY
          What are you gonna say? 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't know. Mr. Mayor! 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Uh, yes! You, on the right. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I, w-what about Elaine... 
          
                         SAMMY
          Lieberman. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Lieberman? 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          What about her? She's the wife of my 
          Sanitation Commissioner. She's got 
          nothing to do with this. What paper are 
          you with, young lady? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, I-I-I-I believe Elaine Lieberman has 
          spoken to Jack Taylor and can back up 
          everything he said. 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Jack Taylor is a reckless man with a 
          gift for manipulating the truth. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, I know Jack Taylor, sir, and-and-
          and-and he is, uh, pretty cocky most of 
          the time, and he does seem to have 
          somewhat of a cavalier attitude, but at 
          least he's honest. 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          I don't know what relationship you have 
          with Mr. Taylor, miss, but it's quite 
          clear you know nothing about politics 
          and nothing about journalism. That's it. 
          No more questions. Thank you.

          Jack, Elaine Lieberman didn't show up. 
          
                         JACK
          I know that. Mr. Mayor! 
          
                         PRESS SECRETARY
          No, no, no, Mr. Taylor. The press 
          conference is over! 
          
                         JACK
          Mr. Mayor, you may be able to strong-arm 
          Manny Feldstein -- that's tough to do -- 
          and you may be able to buffalo my paper 
          into printing a retraction -- they may 
          actually fire me -- but you and I both 
          know this garbage thing stinks, don't 
          we? 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          Pitiful, Mr. Taylor. You and your little 
          friend in the outfit, just pitiful. 
          
                         JACK
          What is pitiful, Mr. Mayor, is that if I 
          had a few minutes more, very well-known 
          Mob front made out to your re-election 
          campaign. 
          
                         MAYOR AIKENS
          That's a blatant fabrication, Mr. 
          Taylor! We both know that no such 
          canceled check exists. 
          
                         JACK
          You know something? You're right. I'm 
          confused. There would be no check, but 
          there would be a deposit slip, wouldn't 
          there, Elaine? Come here. Hi. Can I have 
          that, please? 
          
                         ELAINE
          Hello, Sidney. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. This is dated March 15th of 
          this year. It is a deposit slip for 
          $250,000. That same day, a deposit was 
          made into your campaign account for 
          $250,000, but I guess that was just a 
          coincidence. 
          
                         PRESS SECRETARY
          The press conference is over! I said 
          over! 
          
                         REPORTER
          Mrs. Lieberman, how did you discover the 
          account? 
          
                         JACK
          Elaine, what can I say? 
          
                         ELAINE
          Jack, it was my pleasure. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. See you later. 
          
                         FRANK
          Jack, could I see that document? 
          
                         JACK
          In the paper tomorrow, you can, Frank. 
          You guys wanna go to a soccer game? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. Come on. Let's go. 
          
                         ELANE
          All right, my copy. 
          
                         REPORTER
          Mrs. Lieberman, does your husband know 
          that you've done this? 
          
                         ELAINE
          My husband. Funny you bring that up. 
          He's in Barbados. B-A-R-B-A-D... 
          
                         JACK
          That was an excellent moment of my life. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Congratulations. 
          
                         JACK
          Thank you. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy, can we go to the soccer game now? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes, sweetheart. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, boy, come here. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I really am so sorry about Maggie. Oh, I 
          don't even wanna think about what 
          could've happened. 
          
                         JACK
          I don't wanna think about it either. 
          When I do think about it, I can't 
          believe that I was issued shellfish and 
          dander warnings, sandbox alerts. You 
          even laughed in my face when I showed up 
          at your office on time. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I-I know. 
          
                         JACK
          And then you lost my daughter. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I know. It was the worst thing I 
          could've ever done. I really am so, so 
          very sorry. 
          
                         JACK
          So someone else is the irresponsible 
          one, aren't they? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes, they are. 
          
                         JACK
          I would like to hear you say that. Say 
          it for your kind. 
          
                         MELANIE
          My kind? 
          
                         JACK
          Your kind. The, the one with all the 
          balls in the air. That's the least you 
          could do. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Of course I'll say it, Jack. I was the 
          irresponsible one. 
          
                         JACK
          Great! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Taxi! 
          
                         JACK
          All right. Now say, "I can't do 
          everything on my own." 
          
                         MELANIE
          Why? 
          
                         JACK
          Because with one sentence you'll restore 
          my faith in women again. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Of course, I'll say it for you, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          We're never going to get a cab, you 
          know. 
          
                         JACK
          You can't say it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sure, you can, just as long as you 
          realize that it won't be true. 
          
                         JACK
          I'm waiting. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. I can't do everything alone. 
          
                         JACK
          There. Great. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Even though my daily activities, year 
          after year, immediately contradict what 
          I just said. 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, unbelievable! 
          
                         MELANIE
          You made me grovel for no reason. 
          
                         JACK
          You groveled for great reason. You are 
          an arrogant ball juggler, baby. 
          
                         MELANIE
          First of all, don't call me baby. 
          Secondly, if you don't want your balls 
          juggled, don't throw them in my face. 
          
                         JACK
          I threw them in your face? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes, you did. Starting off this morning 
          when you thrust your stupid column at me 
          as some sort of lame excuse for my son 
          missing his field trip. Balls in my 
          face. Ho ho ho! Big Jack Reporter can't 
          possibly concentrate on mundane details 
          like picking up the phone to say, "Yeah, 
          thanks anyway, but I won't be needing 
          you to take my daughter to school 
          today", and then-- 
          
                         JACK
          Well, that's not quite how it happened. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You have to ask, who I can only assume 
          is gonna be one of your many 
          girlfriends, if she's wearing her 
          panties as loud as you can. Balls in my 
          face. And now in the midst of my obvious 
          remorse, you make me grovel? 
          
                         JACK
          First of all, first of all, I thrust my 
          column in your face because I thought 
          you were the most beautiful woman that 
          I've ever seen in my entire life, and I 
          want-- I wanted to make a good 
          impression. Now, I forgot to call you 
          this morning because I, as opposed to 
          you, am not used to doing everything on 
          my own. So I slipped up there. As for 
          the panties, that remark was directed to 
          my editor Lew, simply to piss you off. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Come on, Dad. I've got a taxi. Can we 
          go? 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, hey. We got the cab. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I think my Dad likes your mom. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Maybe my Mom likes him back. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Men like you have made me the woman I 
          am. 
          
                         JACK
          All the women I know like you have made 
          me think all women are like you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, my God. I almost forgot. I've got, 
          I've got a meeting, drinks with clients. 
          
                         JACK
          5:25. You're never gonna make it. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom, it's the last game of the season. 
          It's for the championship, Mom. And the 
          coach said every kid has to play or they 
          don't get a trophy. Even the losers get 
          a trophy, but you don't get a trophy if 
          you don't play. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I know, Sammy, but it's on the way. 
          We'll make it. Okay? 
          
                         JACK
          Let go of it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I can't let go of it. It's my job. Hold 
          this. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Could we go to the 21 Club, instead? 21 
          West, 52nd Street, and don't try to take 
          14th or 32nd o-or 44th across. You-You 
          can't take a left a-a-at this hour. 
          Okay, I-I-I know I can, I can do this. 
          No, don't take Broadway. It's bound to 
          be a mess. Uh, try 6th Avenue, but not 
          until after 23rd because of the 
          construction. 
          
                         JACK
          French-fried eyeballs floating in a bowl 
          of... 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Snot. 
          
                         JACK
          Snot. 
          
                         JACK
          Here we go. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, why don't you hold the cab? And if 
          I'm not back in fifteen minutes, just go 
          on ahead without me. 
          
                         JACK
          You're gonna take longer than fifteen 
          minutes. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I can do this. Okay, baby. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy, what if you don't come and Daddy 
          doesn't come? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, sweetheart. I'm going to be there. 
          You're the most important thing to me in 
          the entire world. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Your job is. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, you are, but I have to do this now. 
          Sammy, I know I've dragged you places 
          and left you places, and I've-I've been 
          a crazy person today, but it is going to 
          be better tomorrow. A-And I-I-I promise 
          I won't take longer than fifteen minutes 
          in there, okay? Okay? Huh? 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, Sammy, come here. Don't worry about 
          it. She'll make it, okay? Let's get you 
          kids ready for soccer. Grab me that bag. 
          
                         HEAD WAITER
          Hello, how are you? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hi. I see my party. 
          
                         LELAND
          Oh, here she is. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          I'm glad you could make it. What's your 
          poison? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, I'll just have some water. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Nonsense. We're way ahead of you. You 
          have some catching up to do. 
          
                         LELAND
          She'll have a dry vodka martini, 
          straight up. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, what are you thinking about, kiddo? 
          
                         SAMMY
          I hope my Daddy can come to our soccer 
          game. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy hopes he can come, too. Last 
          night... Last night, Mom thought I was 
          sleep, but I really wasn't and I heard 
          her say over and over again, "Please let 
          Eddie come. Please let Eddie come." 
          
                         JACK
          Eddie? Who's Eddie? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Eddie's my Dad. 
          
                         JACK
          I hope he comes, too, there, kiddo. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          We were just discussing plans for a sort 
          of upscale amusement complex for adults. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          You know, with food and games and rides. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          No rides, Dad. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          After drinks, we wanted to take a drive 
          to Stanford. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          We were hoping to take a look at a kind 
          of a bad version of what we have in 
          mind. 
          
                         LELAND
          But before we head out, Melanie, maybe 
          you could toss out a few ideas. Just off 
          the top of your head. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, well, uh, adult amusement complexes 
          u-up until now have been somewhat 
          chessy, uh, usually attached to popular 
          video stores. What I'm thinking of is 
          something, um, a bit more exciting. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          Hmm. 
          
                         LELAND
          A drawing might help, don't you think? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, I... 
          
                         YATES JR.
          I-I love drawings. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I don't have a... 
          
                         LELAND
          Oh. Here you go. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh, okay. Um, uh, let's see. Uh, 
          something like... 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, um... 
          
                         LELAND
          Isn't that the little lost boy from this 
          morning? 
          
                         YATES SR.
          What? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Uh, with, uh, you know, um... 
          
                         MELANIE
          You know, I can't do this now. And I 
          can't go with you to Stanford now 
          either. Yes, Mr. Leland, that is the 
          little lost boy from this morning, only 
          he's not lost. He's my son. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I have a child and he has a soccer game 
          in twenty minutes. If he's late, he 
          doesn't get the trophy. And because I'm 
          in here with you, he's probably going to 
          be late. But what gets to me more than 
          anything is, instead of crying about it, 
          he's out there with a big, old smile 
          blowing fish faces at us. Gentlemen, if 
          you're smart, you'll want me as much for 
          my dedication and ability as for the 
          fact that I am going to ditch you right 
          now and I am going to run like hell 
          across town so that my kid knows that 
          what matters to me most is him. And, Mr. 
          Leland, your real grounds for firing me 
          should be if I were to stay here with 
          you. 
          
                         YATES SR.
          I like her. 
          
                         YATES JR.
          A lot. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, I probably lost my job, but at 
          least we still have ten minutes to get 
          to the game. 
          
                         JACK
          Hey, short cut! Short cut! 
          
                         MELANIE
          In spite of everything, Jack, I, I want 
          you to know that I do sincerely 
          apologize for losing Maggie. 
          
                         JACK
          That's all right. Same thing happened to 
          me this morning. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You lost Maggie this morning? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, she wandered off after the office 
          cat. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It might've been helpful if you'd 
          mentioned her tendency to wander. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Oh! Well, it might've been 
          helpful-- Here we go. Up here-- If you 
          had mentioned Sammy's tendency to stick 
          things up his nose. 
          
                         MELANIE
          He didn't! 
          
                         JACK
          Oh, yeah. Way up there. In fact, they 
          had to use this plier-type thing. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It's called an alligator, a tool I have 
          come to know well. Okay! 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Kiddo, here we go. Come on. 
          
                         MELANIE
          See? I told you we'd make it. Any other 
          catastrophes? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Lois Lane ate the glass fish. 
          
                         JACK
          Why does that not surprise me? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Sorry, Sammy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Lois Lane? 
          
                         JACK
          Well, come on. We got to hurry up. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I gotta go to the bathroom. 
          
                         JACK
          I'll take you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Why don't I take her? 
          
                         MELANIE
          So, Maggie, you know that lady Celia 
          from your dad's office? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Is she your daddy's girlfriend? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          No way. She wants to be, but she isn't. 
          He wants somebody who would love his 
          cookie too, and Celia's not the type. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Here. I'll get that other sock for you. 
          
                         JACK
          Here we go! 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me that. It's my 
          cat. 
          
                         MELANIE
          So maybe you and Maggie could come over 
          for some dinner after the game. We could 
          order out a little Chinese or something. 
          Oh, thank God. He's here. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Dad! 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh! So what do you say? 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, I don't think so. It's been a long 
          day. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Yeah, I'm a little, little tired 
          myself. So I guess I should go over and 
          say hi to Sammy's Dad. 
          
                         JACK
          I usually watch the game over on the 
          sidelines there. That's where I like to 
          watch it. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          It was a good day. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          All right, come here. 
          
                         EDDIE
          What? You can't even look at me? 
          
                         MELANIE
          This is the second game you've made it 
          to in two years, Eddie. 
          
                         EDDIE
          Look, I'm here, aren't I? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Daddy! Are you staying for the whole 
          game? Are you? 
          
                         EDDIE
          You bet I am. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Cool. I'll play my best. You watch me. 
          My really best. 
          
                         EDDIE
          That's great. Go get 'em, tiger. 
          
                         EDDIE
          Come on. I saved us a seat. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Here, Dad. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Hey, Dad! 
          
                         EDDIE
          You know, part of the reason I came here 
          today was to tell Sammy in person that 
          I'm not gonna be able to make our 
          fishing trip this summer. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You can't do this to him, Eddie. 
          
                         EDDIE
          I got a gig playing with Bruce, Mel. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Can't you see how much he needs you? 
          
                         EDDIE
          Come on, Mel. You can't expect me to 
          pass this up. 
          
                         COACH
          Get it, get it! 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom! Hey, Mom. Look! Yes. 
          
                         JACK
          Go, Maggie. Come on! Maggie, come on. 
          Let's go. Down the alley. Right down the 
          alley. Let's go. Watch him. Watch that 
          kid. Bodycheck him, Maggie. Body-check 
          him. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          But that would be rude, Daddy. 
          
                         JACK
          That's not rude. That's sports. There 
          you go. Shag it. What-- Hey! Hey! Come 
          on. 
          
                         COACH
          Who's that guy? 
          
                         JACK
          Get that kid! 
          
                         JACK
          Good game there, Sammy. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Thanks, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          I'll see ya. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thanks for everything. 
          
                         JACK
          You, too. I'll see you. Okay, you ready? 
          Okay, hang on. Got it. 
          
                         EDDIE
          You were great. So I'll see you real 
          soon, okay, big guy? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Okay. 
          
                         EDDIE
          Bye, Mel. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Bye. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hey, let's get your rain stuff on, okay? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Let me see your trophy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Wow! You think that's real gold? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yeah. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You do? What is that on his head? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Soccer ball. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay, you ready? Arrgh! 
          
                         SAMMY
          Should we try to get a cab, Mom? 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. I kind of feel like walking. 
          
                         SAMMY
          In the rain? 
          
                         MELANIE
          What do you care? You're dressed for 
          Niagara Falls. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mom, I'm hungry. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Huh? I'll be right there, honey. 
          
                         JACK
          All right, that's a deal. Gimme this 
          one. Good night. Come here. Good night. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Good night. 
          
                         JACK
          We'll be right here in the box, okay? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          All right. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          You know, Daddy, when me and Melanie 
          were in the bathroom, she asked me if 
          Celia was your girlfriend. 
          
                         JACK
          She did? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Yeah. She really likes you. 
          
                         JACK
          Hmph. Good night. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Good night. 
          
                         JACK
          She told you she likes me? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          It's so obvious, Daddy. Good night. 
          
                         JACK
          Hmm. Did she say anything else about me? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I don't know, Daddy. I'm pretty tired. 
          I'm gonna go to sleep now. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay, yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          What are we gonna do about those fish? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          What? 
          
                         JACK
          We gotta go buy new fish. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Now? 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Now? Yes. Sammy can't go back to 
          class tomorrow without those fish. By 
          noon, he'll kill them. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          But I'm wearing my pajamas. 
          
                         JACK
          All we gotta do is pick 'em out. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Hi. 
          
                         JACK
          Hi. Maggie insisted that we bring Sammy 
          some new fish. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thank you. Um, do you guys-- Do you 
          wanna come in for a minute? 
          
                         JACK
          No, we don't want to-- We don't wanna 
          intrude. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Oh. Okay. Well... 
          
                         JACK
          Yes. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Thanks. 
          
                         JACK
          Here they are. Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Okay. Thank you. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Come on, Dad. 
          
                         JACK
          Um... 
          
                         MELANIE
          Come in. Please. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. A few minutes. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Hi, Jack. 
          
                         JACK
          Sammy. Hi. Unh! Unh! What do you weigh? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Wanna come see my room? 
          
                         MAGGIE
          Okay. 
          
                         JACK
          Huh. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You're investigating my apartment. 
          
                         JACK
          Not as neat as I would've thought. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Well, it's only neat on Sunday mornings 
          when my mother comes for brunch. If she 
          sees it like this, she shakes her head, 
          which means she's unhappy with my life 
          choices. And then she lets out a sigh 
          that means she would've rather have gone 
          to my sister's for brunch. 
          
                         JACK
          Um... 
          
                         MELANIE
          Um, you guys wanna watch a video? 
          
                         MAGGIE & SAMMY
          Yeah! 
          
                         MELANIE
          How about "The Wizard of Oz?" 
          
                         SAMMY
          Yeah! 
          
                         MELANIE
          You can get all snuggled up on my bed 
          and watch for a little while. 
          
                         SAMMY
          I wanna watch the whole thing, Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          It is too late. You can watch for as 
          long as it takes us to drink one cup of 
          coffee. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Two cups of coffee. 
          
                         MELANIE
          We'll see. 
          
                         JACK
          It's always such a dilemma when you have 
          kids. 
          
                         MELANIE
          After Sammy's dad and I got divorced, I 
          put up pictures of him all over Sammy's 
          room. I guess I wanted to reassure him 
          that no matter what, his dad would still 
          be in his life. You want, uh, cream 
          or... 
          
                         JACK
          No, that's fine. Sammy's very proud of 
          his daddy. He talked about him all day 
          today. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I know. I'm sure he did. 
          
                         JACK
          Is he really, uh, rock 'n' rock drummer? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. He's touring with Springsteen this 
          summer. 
          
                         JACK
          Really? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yeah. 
          
                         JACK
          Springsteen? Wow. Uh, you know, um, I'm 
          beating around the bush here a little 
          bit, and there's something I got to ask 
          you. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes? 
          
                         JACK
          Uh, why did you spend the entire day 
          flirting with me if you were thinking 
          about getting back with your ex-husband? 
          
                         MELANIE
          What? I spent the whole day disliking 
          you intensely. You were flirting with 
          me. You even told the kids you wanted to 
          ask me out. 
          
                         JACK
          I never told them that. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Yes, you did. That was your big secret. 
          They told me. It was all about you and 
          me and going somewhere and feelings. You 
          were going to ask me out. 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. The big secret was about Sammy 
          getting my marble stuck up his nose, and 
          I never once even thought about asking 
          you out. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I am so sure. 
          
                         JACK
          I don't know why I would even want to. 
          
                         MELANIE
          You said you thought I was the most 
          beautiful woman you'd ever seen. 
          
                         JACK
          That was a line. 
          
                         MELANIE
          That was not a line, Jack, and you know 
          it. You wanted me ever since I knew you 
          were a writer, and you said your 
          attitude was derived from my attitude. 
          
                         JACK
          And you wanted me ever since the 9th 
          Street Drop-In Center when you saw me 
          putting my watch on Maggie. 
          
                         MELANIE
          For someone who is so totally 
          disinterested in the other person, you 
          sure do remember every single, minor 
          detail of the entire day. 
          
                         JACK
          You remember better than I do. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I do not. 
          
                         JACK
          Yes, you do. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, I don't. 
          
                         JACK
          What would you do if I kissed you right 
          now? 
          
                         MELANIE
          You're not gonna kiss me right now. 
          
                         JACK
          What would you do if I did? 
          
                         MELANIE
          Do you wanna kiss me right now? 
          
                         JACK
          I wouldn't have mentioned it if I 
          didn't. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Fine. 
          
                         JACK
          You're just reeling me in, aren't you? 
          You're like Roy Scheider at the end of 
          Jaws. The minute I open my mouth, you're 
          gonna drop a big bomb in there, then 
          you're gonna wear a set of my teeth 
          around your neck. 
          
                         MELANIE
          So you're admitting you're a big shark. 
          
                         JACK
          I am admitting that I am... scared of 
          getting close to anyone again. 
          
                         MELANIE
          I'm just as scared as you are. 
          
                         JACK
          Don't bite. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No, I won't. 
          
                         SAMMY
          Mommy. 
          
                         MELANIE
          What? 
          
                         SAMMY
          Can you fast-forward for us? That mean 
          lady's on, and we hate that apart. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Sweetheart, you know how to use the 
          fast-forward. 
          
                         SAMMY
          The remote's broken. 
          
                         MAGGIE
          And she's stealing Toto. 
          
                         MELANIE
          There, she's gone. Okay? This is the 
          color part. You love this part. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Wait. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah. Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          No. Let's-Let's do this right. Let me, 
          um, go in and freshen up so I feel a 
          little more like a woman and not a den 
          mommy. Okay? Um, why don't you go in -- 
          go sit over there, and close your eyes, 
          lay your head back and anticipate my 
          return? 
          
                         JACK
          Okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Or you can go in and watch The Wizard of 
          Oz and wait for me to come back. 
          
                         JACK
          Yeah, okay. 
          
                         MELANIE
          Stopped raining. Jack? 
          
                         TV
          You're out of the woods 
          You're out of the dark 
          You're out of the light 
          Step into the sun, 
          Step into the light 
          Keep straight ahead for the most glorious 
          
                         MAGGIE
          I wonder what they're doing.
