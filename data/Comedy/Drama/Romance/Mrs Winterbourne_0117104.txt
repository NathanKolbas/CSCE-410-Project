EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NEW YORK - DAY 1
Blue like the ocean or the sky. Slowly, focus intensifies. The

blue is a knitted fabric, covering something large and full and

round ... A woman's left hand, with no wedding band, gently pats

this roundness.

CONSTANCE DOYLE (19), in blue sweats and a ratty jacket that barely
covers her large, round abdomen, lies on a Park bench. A COP walks
up, raps on the back of her bench. ~

COP
On your feet.

belly.

CONNIE
What time is it?

COP
Four o'clock.
HOO CONNIE

I specifically asked for a three
o'clock wake up call.

COP

She hoists herself onto her feet. The cop prods her a little and
strolls off. Connie hoists a small knapsack onto her shoulder.

CONNIE (0.S.)
Most pregnant women bring out the
best in men ... then there's me.
She walks along, going nowhere in particular. A cool breeze blows
through the trees. She tries to wrap her jacket around herself
but there's too much of her and not enough jacket.

CONNIE (0.S.)
I‘m Constance Doyle. I'm nineteen
years old, pregnant, single and
homeless. How's your day going?

knapsack, looking lost.

CONNIE (0.S.)

INT. NEW YORK DINER ~ DAY 10
Connie sits in a booth, counting out change from a beaded purse.

Across the aisle is STEVE - a smooth guy in sharp clothes, around
thirty. He winks at her. She looks away.

CONNIE (0.S.)
Now, some people will tell you New
York City's fulla nothing but
Ay creeps, hustlers, and sieazeballs.
oS. On my first day I got to meet all
three rolled into one.

Steve sits next to her. She looks the other way. He reaches out
to her - with a little sleight-of-hand, he pulls a business card
out of thin air and hands it to her.

CONNIE (0.S.}
He gimme his card. I thought cards
were official, like a badge or
something. I didn't know you could
run ‘em off at any copy shop.

She looks up at him, amused.
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY ll

Connie and Steve are strolling along together. Connie is still
admiring Steve's card.

CONNIE
It's nice, but it don't say what you do.

STEVE

CONNIE
Wow. For who?

CONNIE (0.S.)

it gave me hope. And to give you an
idea of how stupid I still was, I
couldn't wait to tell him.

INT. STEVE'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - DAY 16
Another gathering of Steve's scuzzy friends, sitting around the

coffee table, full of more stolen goods. Steve is staring at her,
hopped up and angry - she's a terrified little girl.

STEVE
Don't gimme that shit.

He turns to one of his pals, who hasn't been listening.

STEVE (cont'd)
You screwed Connie, didn't you?

The pal looks up, scared.

PAL
No, man, never.

Steve grabs him by the collar and screams at him.

STEVE
I said, ‘Did you screw Connie?'!

PAL
(quickly)
Sure, I did, yeah, lots!

He tosses the pal aside and dismisses Connie.

STEVE
Slut.
But she moves into him.

CONNIE (0.S.)
And if you're wondering why I kept
the baby, well, first of all, it's
none of your/business and second,
I guess I felt like I been alone

I figured ‘here's somebody who can
keep me company,' which is stupid,
I know, but like I told you,
stupid's what I do best.

EXT. CITY STREET - NEW YORK - DAY 20
Connie walks along the busy sidewalk.
CONNIE (0.S.)

MAN

I'm your host. Can I show you to

Connie out of breath and scared,’ leans on a Partition. There's a
guy in the seat next to her. She meets his eyes, trying to guilt
him into giving her his seat. He looks away, uncomfortable, and
starts reading the paper. SUDDENLY -

She looks up to see the Conductor standing right in front of her. —~
She starts rummaging through her bag, vamping for time. Pulls out
her beaded purse and opens it - empty.

CONNIE
My husband must have it.
(looking back to the other car)
Stee-eeve!

The Conductor glances that way - she takes off the other way, using
her last bit of strength to get to the next car. The Conductor
hurries after her - the people on the floor block his way,
accidentally-on-purpose.

INT. TRAIN - CLUB CAR ~ MOVING - NIGHT 40

A handsome young man in his early thirties (HUGH) is lounging
against the bar waitirig for his Grink, WHISTLING "Sunny Side of the

Connie hurries through - sees the empty spot next to him and grabs
onto the bar, grateful for something to lean on. Hugh smiles at
her as he collects his drink. Suddenly, the Conductor is next to
him, jostling him and splashing his drink as he grabs Connie.

CONDUCTOR #2

She looks at him, a deer caught in headlights. But then Hugh is
next to her, holding out two tickets.

HUGH

Connie is amazed. The Conductor is Pissed. He takes the tickets

It's small, but compared to the rest of the train it feels like
St. Peter's. Connie looks around, stunned by the free room and
the relative quiet. She dxops her knapsack to the floor.

CONNIE
This is yours?

HUGH
‘Fraid so. You wouldn't believe what
they charge for this sardine can.

Connie eases into a seat - she can't even remember the jast time
she sat down. It's the ultimate luxury.

CONNIE
It wasn't enough. If it was all the
money in the world, it wasn't enough.

HUGH
I had no idea it would be this

Boy, those college days seem a
million miles away.

CONNIE

The door opens and another woman enters (PATRICIA) - a beautiful,
classy woman about Connie's age, but dressed to the nines with
lovely legs and perfect hair. She's also eight months pregnant,

but she carries’ it lightly, as if it were a helium balloon. As she
walks in, she looks with mild surprise at the pregnant woman in the™
compartment, then glances at Hugh.

PATRICIA
Hugh, is there something I should know?

Hugh smiles at her warmly and introduces Connie.
HUGH
Patricia, this is a pregnant woman I
picked up in the club car.
She smiles and offers her hand to Connie.

PATRICIA

like a pregnant water buffalo under her elegant gaze. She clutches
her beaded purse in her lap, finding the silence between them
uncomfortable ~- she knows she ought to say something, so she leans
forward to introduce herself.

CONNIE
My name's Connie -

But as she leans, the train takes a jolt and she spills her soda
over Patricia.

CONNIE (cont'd)
I'm sorry.

She pulls an old, stained bandanna out of her purse and starts
mopping a startled Patricia.

CONNIE (cont'd)
I'm such a spazz. I should leave
you guys alone.

Connie heads to the door, while Patricia spots her dress with a
handkerchief. She speaks without looking up.

PATRICIA
How far along are you?

CONNIE
Huh? Oh, I don't know, twelve,
thirteen months?

Patricia laughs and this loosens Connie up a little.

PATRICIA
You know you're my first American
conversation? I've been living in
Hong Kong since I was eight.

CONNIE
Oh, well, we all throw soda on each
other now. It's kind of a new thing.

Patricia laughs.

PATRICIA
Don't worry about it. It's these
trains. We'd have flown, but Hugh
wouldn't let me take a plane in ‘my
condition.‘ And we heard such
wonderful things about the Q.E.- Two.

Anyway, I had no idea. My dad worked
for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong, so I
grew up as one of those transplanted
American banking brats.

CONNIE
Oh, those.

PATRICIA
(rolling her eyes)
Guilty as charged. So anyway, about a
year ago, my dad died and I didn't know
what I was going to do. I didn't have
anybody. I don't even remember my mom.

CONNIE
(looking up, touched)
I'm sorry.
PATRICIA

Then I ran into Hugh, and I thought
he was just another preppy American
slumming around the Far East, doing
the Miss Saigon bit? But, guess
what? I fell in love, so we bummed
our way to Europe, really living on
nothing, which I think is the best

Hey, I swear by it.

There's a jolt. The door flies open and Patricia disappears into
the hallway, still holding the purse.

The whole room seems to be tipping onto Connie ..

Then, she hears the sound, the LOUD SCREECH OF RIPPING METAL. The
whole compartment seems to upend, to shift on a crazy axis, so that
what had been the wall before her becomes the ceiling over her.

The floor rises up before her. The door is gone - hopelessly out
of reach ... The emergency lights flash off and on, flickering on
Connie's fearful eyes. As she is propelled backwards, her eyes
flutter closed and we fade out ...

Bouquets of colorful flowers fill the room. She's pleasantly

Okay, sure ... fine. Hugh it is.

Grace can't hold back the tears any longer. She's really crying

GRACE
I miss him so much.

Connie reaches out to touch Grace. She hears someone coming down
the stairs and glances up.

INT. MANSION - FOYER/STAIRCASE - DAY

Connie panics. Is it a ghost? Is Hugh really still alive? Her
first instinct is to flee. Connie grabs the baby from Grace.

“Hugh" is standing next to Grace now. Grace notices the look on
Connie's face.

GRACE
Patricia, didn't Hugh tell you he
had a twin?

CONNIE
(trying to recover)
Yes, but ... I didn't know he was
identical.
GRACE

Oh, that must have been such a shock.

CONNIE
No, I'm still confused from that
train wreck.

Grace shoots an annoyed look at Bill.

GRACE
Anyone with half a brain would be
sensitive to that.
BILL
Thank you, Mother.
He steps forward and offers his hand. His manner at the best of

times is reserved and abrupt, with an acerbic wit that keeps the
world at a distance. And this isn't the best of times.

BILL (cont'd)
I'm Bill.

She's got her hands full with the baby - she awkwardly extends a
finger.and he shakes it, observing all proper decorum.

BILL (cont'd)
I only wish we could have met under
more pleasant circumstances.

Bill stands, slightly panicked, holding the child in his stiff arms. *
Grace tries to smooth over Bill's awkwardness.

GRACE
Isn't he a lovely child, Bill?

He knows he must say the right thing.
BILL
Oh, yes. Lucky for him he doesn't
look anything like us.
Connie swallows,. uncomfortably.

Grace leans in and takes the baby from Bill and heads up the stairs. *

INT. MANSION - CONNIE'S BEDROOM - DAY 81

Hugh's old bedroom, re~done for the happy couple. Colorful, light.
An alcove to one side has been done up as an elaborate nursery, with
every creature comfort a drooling infant could hope for. The baby is
sleeping in an antique crib. Connie is sitting next to him, beating
her head with her fists. . .
CONNIE
What was I thinking!? I'11 never
get away with this!

Grace enters, carrying a couple of photo albums, again decorated with
the Winterbourne crest.
REVISED - BLUE - May 22, 1995 page 38.

Connie immediately wheels to her feet, one hand on the crib, looking
as poised as she can and speaking in her idea of ‘rich people talk. '

CONNIE (cont'd)
Hello, Mother Winterbourne.

Grace smiles at Connie's attempt.

GRACE
That's what I called my mother-in-
law when I first met her. It felt
appropriate. She seemed so cold and

distant.
CONNIE
What did you end up calling her?
GRACE
Mother Winterbourne... She was cold *
and distant. *

She sits on the bed and starts flipping through the albums.

GRACE (cont'd) . *
I had these put together when Hugh
told me you were coming. Old ‘
pictures of the boys to torment you *
with during your visit. Hugh was
particularly embarrassed by this one
of him naked except for the cowboy *
hat and the holster. But, you're
oniy in college once, I suppose.

She closes the books, with a sigh.
GRACE (cont ‘d)}
You know, I just haven't got the
strength to cry anymore.
Pulling herself together, Grace looks at Connie and forces a smile.

GRACE (cont'd) *
Call me Grace.

She bends over the crib, breathing in near the baby's head.

GRACE (cont'd)
Babies have such a wonderful smell.
7 If I close my eyes, I can imagine
it's Hugh.

 

She looks over at Connie, while gently touching the baby's head.

GRACE (cont'd)
Thanks for keeping this one safe.

the look of grief pass over his face.

He pulls himself together.

PACO (cont'd)
We dress for dinner.

Connie gives him a big thumbs-up.

CONNIE
Me too!

Her baggy sleeve flops down her wrist. She tugs at it self-consciously.
Paco exits. Connie goes over to the bassinet and picks up the baby.

CONNIE (cont'd)
All right, Cookie, here's our

Grace and Bill and FATHER BRIAN, a red-faced, obtuse and jolly priest

spotting Connie, the baby and Paco as they enter. Bill and the
Father rise, looking straight at her. She clutches the baby a little
tighter and suppresses the desire to run from the room ... Grace
gestures for her to be seated.

much. Sophie is at her side, holding a serving dish of vegetables. *

Connie grabs the serving dish and helps herself. Then she leans
across the ornate table to Father Brian.

CONNIE (cont'd)
Want some?

Father Brian is a trifle surprised, but nods. Sophie reaches over
to take the serving dish from Connie - Connie hangs on to it.

Sophie takes the serving dish and speaks firmly.

Oh, I don‘t blame you. Hugh probably

Connie wants to say something to make up for Hugh's Slight. She
speaks simply, saying what she can of the Hugh she actually knew.

CONNIE

I know he wasn't always responsible
..- And sometimes that looked like

- thoughtlessness ... But to me, and I
know I knew him such a short time
compared to all of you, but to me,
there was a kindness about him that
was so much sweeter because it was so

EXT. BOSTON CATHEDRAL - DAY
A sunny day.
INT. CATHEDRAL - MAIN CHAPEL ~- DAY

Huge, intimidating Gothic architecture. Stained glass windows and
shafts of rainbow-colored lights falling on the congregation.
Father Brian, in his vestments, speaks beneath the ornate crucifix.

Connie stands with the Winterbournes around the baptismal font.
She is dressed in expensive black and holding the baby who is
dressed in an antique christening gown.

Connie looks pretty good ~ but her hair's still scraggly and she
still wears that Jersey girl make-up. Not too garish, but
definitely not the classy style of the other women around her -
like that of the two high society debutantes, CHRISTINE and SUSAN,
we see seated nearby.

Out of the corner of her eye, Connie watches the others go through
the ceremony. She hears:

ALL
‘I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Creator of Heaven and Earth ...'

She watches their lips, trying to say what they say, which is:

ALL
‘This is our faith. This is the
faith of the Church. We are proud
to profess it, in Christ Jesus,
our Lord.'

but from her sounds more like:

CONNTE
. ‘This is our fade. This is the fade
of the Churg. We are loud to confess
it, in Jesus Christ, our lob.'

The congregation continues as Connie attempts to keep up:

emotionally draining. Paco is there too.

Hugh's head and he begins to howl in protest.

FATHER BRIAN

Holy Spirit.

Grace and Connie are both blinking back tears.
EXT. CATHEDRAL - FRONT STEPS - DAY

The Winterbournes and their guests come out of the church, As they
pause at the top of the steps, a SOCIETY PHOTOGRAPHER approaches.
Grace recognizes him.

SOCIETY PHOTOGRAPHER
Could I get a quick shot of all of
you?

Grace, Connie and Bill pose with the baby, Father Brian walks over
and Connie takes him aside, nervously babbling as Father Brian
listens, befuddled.

CONNIE

I had a question. Just as fer
instance, and by the way, you were
fabulous, am I supposed to tip you?

(he shakes his head, confused)
Anyway, the thing is, if somebody
was to, say baptize their baby with
a fake name, would the mother just
go to hell, or would the baby be in
on that too?

(he stares at her blankly)
I'm not talking about me. This is
for a friend. Long story. Boy, the
scrapes she gets into. She'll work
it out.

She hurries off, leaving Father Brian bewildered. Grace comes over
and gives the baby a kiss .

playing old standards. It looks like a carnival of rich people

Connie shuts her eyes, pained. Then she smiles her best smile.

Connie swallows nervously as she follows Bill. Grace and numerous

Bill nods. They both watch as Connie is bumped by a Passerby and
spills her glass all over the front of her dress. She grabs for a
napkin from a nearby table and tips over a small dip bowl. ‘The dip...

ANOTHER ANGLE - Connie is wiping dip off her fingers with a napkin.
Grace swoops by, carrying the baby.

GRACE
There you are! Come on.

Connie trips over her feet, bumping into a MATRONLY OLD WOMAN, who
shoots her an angry look. Grace is leading Connie to Christine,
who stands talking with her equally deb young friend, Susan.

GRACE (cont'd)
There are so many old fogies here, I
want you to meet someone your own age.
You'll have more in common.

Connie blanches when she sees the two sophisticated young women.

CONNTE
Oh, I'll bet.

They walk up to them.
GRACE

Christine Thornhill, Susan Gillespie,
this is my daughter-in-law Patricia.

CONNIE
How ya doin'?

Connie offers her hand - there's an awkward moment while Christine
passes her buffet plate to Susan and shakes Connie's hand. Connie
then turns to Susan and offers her hand. Susan looks perplexed,
then passes both plates to Christine and shakes Connie's hand.

Grace goes off to mingle. Connie looks after her, a little helpless.
Christine smiles. An uncomfortable silence. A waiter passes with a
tray of hors d'oeuvres. Connie grabs one, glad for something to do.
It's a stuffed new potato. Not bad.

SUSAN
It must be hard to have to suddenly
fit in here, huh?

CONNIE
You don‘t know.

Christine and Susan turn to greet another guest as another waiter-borne
tray passes by. Connie grabs a beggar's purse off it, examining the odd
object curiously. She unwraps it. The messy contents spill out into her
hand. She scoops it all into her mouth, hoping no one notices.

CHRISTINE
Well, we want you to know that if
you ever have any questions, if you
ever need anything, you can always
call on us. Promise?

It's a first kiss, awkward and tentative. It ends quickly and they
look at one another in blank surprise.

He continues to walk toward the dining room, but stops again.

BILL (cont'd)
Wait, I don't live here. I'll go

He turns around and goes toward the back door. As he passes her,
he stops and kisses her again. Warmer now and close. They lose
themselves in the kiss and hold each other close. He pulls away.

‘BILL
Wow.

He moves again toward the back door, but catches himself, comes back.

BILL
No, that’s the back way. My car's out

He leaves Connie out of breath and stunned, her emotions a total

No, no, that was just a brother-in-

CONNIE
(whispering)
Get away from me!

STEVE
(speaking up)
What's wrong, Connie. Is something
bothering you, Connie? Huh, Connie?

People start to look at them. She yanks him further from the others.

Loti
ONY CONNIE
What do you want?

Steve is the picture of innocence wronged.

STEVE
Why do I have to want something?
You always thought the worst of me,
didn't you? Maybe that's why you
always brought it out.

CONNIE
Why are you here?

He looks up at her, doing his best hurt "How could you ask that
question?" face.

STEVE
I thought you were dead. I thought
my only child was dead. That does
something to a man, Connie. I cried,
I really did. I cried for you and
for the kid and for how I'm pissing

real changes, you'd be proud. Then a
few weeks later I'm stealing this car
radio and I run across a People
magazine and there's this picture of
the Winterbourne family, and wouldn't
you know it, their new daughter-in-
law looks just like this tramp from
Jersey I used to know. I had to see
if it was true.

CONNIE
You sent me that note?

He smiles, all warmth.

STEVE
Well, just ‘cause you didn't write,
I didn't see any reason for me to be
insensitive.

CONNIE
Okay, it worked, you got me scared,
So what's next?

Steve laughs.

He starts away as if to leave,

Connie waits.

STEVE

You're so nervous! I just want to
congratulate you on this great life
you've, whaddya call it?
.../appropriated' for yourself.

(over her objection)
Hey, why not? The dead chick wasn't
gonna use it anymore. And, by the
way, marrying the guy's brother? That
is pure genius. I didn't know you had
it in you. Good job.

CONNIE
(quiet)
And that's it?

STEVE

Absolutely.

Connie lashes out. :

CONNIE
I'll give you a goddamn role -

STEVE
If you're uncomfortable, I'd be just
as happy to discuss this with your
mother-in-law. How do you think her
heart would take my news?

CONNIE
No more bullshit. What do you want?

Steve extends his hand to her face - does his old magic trick,
pulling a matchbook out of thin air. The matchbook cover has the
name and address of a motel on it.

STEVE
Come by my place tomorrow. And
bring my boy. What'd you name him,
‘Hugh,' after the dead rich guy?

CONNIE
You come near him, I'll kill you.

Steve shakes his head.

STEVE
You got no class, you know that?
That's why I dumped you. They can
dress you up, but -

CONNIE
(steely)
I'm not kidding.

Steve steps close to her, grabbing her by the hair - the smiling
pretense is gone and his eyes burn with a cold cruelty. She
flinches, fear in his eyes.

STEVE
Be there tomorrow. Or I'll mess up
your life so bad, you'll never see
that kid again.

He steps away from her - her hair is now falling in her face. He
laughs at her.

Bill stands by the wall, watching him go.

GRACE AND PACO stand by the window, their eyes following Steve as
he leaves, snatching an hors d'deuvre and popping it into his mouth
as he saunters out, the picture of arrogance. Paco turns to Grace.

No. But you're going to find out.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ~- COURTYARD - DAY 146
A cloudy day, threatening rain.
One of those motels from the fifties, it hasn't been painted ina
decade or two.
A yellow cab pulls up and Connie climbs out with the baby.
INT. CHEAP MOTEL ~ STEVE'S ROOM - DAY 147

Four dingy walls and an old bed.

Steve is trying to set up an old, stained playpen - he's standing
in it, kicking at the bottom, trying to flatten it out. He steps
out of it and tosses in some toys - a chewed up teddy bear and a
couple of Leggos.

He looks up to see Connie in the window, looking in. He crosses to
the door to let her in ... She enters, pushing the stroller,
looking very out of place in her expensive coat.

Steve doesn't spare her a glance - he goes straight to the baby,
lifting him out of the stroller. :

STEVE
There's the guy! Big boy! Look at
that, that's my chin, that's my
goddam chin!

Connie walks in carefully, keeping her back to the wall as she
circles him.

/ CONNIE
Him;

Steve carries Hugh to the playpen.
WHITE - May 5, 1995 page 96.

STEVE
Hey, Pal, look what I got for you
here.

He plops the kid down in the middle of playpen and stands back -
the baby starts howling.

STEVE (cont'd)
What's with him?

CONNIE
He's got taste.

Connie goes to Hugh - Steve steps in ahead of her and picks him up-—
The baby quiets and looks up at him, curious.

STEVE
You know, this is a very emotional
moment for me. Do you know how much
it means to a man to know that his
name is gonna be passed on? That's an
awful lot you're asking me to give up.
And for what? Have you offered me
anything in return, even a kind word?
No. You just look at me like I'm
going to contaminate your precious
baby ~- like you'd even have the little
bastard if it wasn't for me.

He sits in the playpen, giving the kid a Leggo to chew on.

CONNTE
Did you wash that?

STEVE
Huh? Oh, sure.

Connie steps into the playpen and takes the Leggo away from him -
Hugh starts bawling again. She roots through her purse for
something else to give him.

CONNIE
So you got a plan, right? Let's
hear it.

She hands the baby a pacifier. He sucks on it, happily.

STEVE
I tell you what I ought to do. I
ought to tell the Winterbournes all
about this nasty little con you're
pulling on ‘em. I mean, it's not
right to let the kid grow up livin'
a lie. I should let everybody know
who he really is ... and sue for
custody.
WHITE - May 5, 1995 page 97.
Connie looks back at him.

STEVE (cont'd)
And don't think I wouldn't get it.
Birth fathers are winning cases
like this every day. And look at
the character of the mother.

He starts tickling the baby.

STEVE (cont'd)
A slut con artist, exploiting a
grieving family to get their fortune.
{to the baby) ~
Mommy would never see you again.

The baby giggles. Steve leans back against the Playpen.

STEVE (cont'd)
But the problem with that is, I
still get nothing and I wind up
stuck with a baby, and who needs
that?

Connie stands up and takes a check out of her purse.

CONNIE
It's all filled out. Just tell me
the amount.

STEVE
(picking a number out of the air)
50,000.

She hesitates ... then crosses to the bureau and fills in the
amount and hands him the check.

STEVE (cont'd)
‘Patricia Winterbourne.’ Very nice.

He steps out of the crib and gets an envelope from the bed table. He
puts the check in and seals it. He slips the envelope in his pocket.

STEVE (cont'd)

Thanks, but that's nowhere near
enough. I have a better idea.

(off her reaction)
No, you'll like it. It's an idea
where everybody gets what they want.
And how many ideas like that do you
ever come up with? You want to hear
it?

CONNIE
Why're you asking me if I: want to
hear it?
Wale - bay 2, L999 page 35.

STEVE

Do you want to hear it?

#™ connie walks back and forth, not looking at him.

CONNIE
(in a monotone)
: Sure, I want to hear it, I'll die if
5 I don't hear it.

STEVE
(pleased)
You take the kid out for a walk
somewheres. I‘1l show up and
kidnap him.

Connie stops and looks him dead in the face.

STEVE (cont'd)
Don't worry, I'll give you a good
smack so it looks like you struggled.
They'11 cough up at least a million
for him, right? I take that, drop
off the baby and that way I get a
fair return for sacrificing my
paternal rights.

CONNIE
on You're out of your friggin' mind.
You go near that kid and I'm calling
the police.
STEVE

Then I'll tell them it was your idea.

CONNIE
They wouldn't believe you.

STEVE
Why else would you pay me 50,000
dollars? With a forged check, by
the way.

Connie begins pacing the room, looking for a way out,

CONNIE
I will not hurt those people.

They're not gonna miss a pissant

A cab pulls up to the curb away from the motel. Connie gets out
and starts walking.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 153

Connie walks up to Steve’s motel. Someone is walking toward her.
She nods to the stranger as she passes - she can't make her out in
the night, but she's a very pregnant blonde.

CONNIE
‘Night.

The stranger just walks on ... Once she's gone, Connie hustles to
find Steve's room... She stops in front of his door. She almost
knocks, but then she decides to try the knob instead. She turns
it, quietly, carefully and opens the door ...

Hello, Steve. Your partner's here.
I got a little change in the plan.

He doesn't look up. She walks to the foot of the bed, trying not
to lose her nerve.

CONNIE (cont'd)
Instead of me taking the kid for a
walk and you stealing him...

She pulls the gun out and levels it on him. She speaks, her
trembling voice belying her attempt to sound tough.

CONNIE (cont'd)
+++ you get the hell out of my life
or I blow your head off.

He doesn't even look up. She is thrown off by his apparent lack of
interest.

CONNIE (cont'd)
Stop watchin' the damn Tv.

She switches it off. Still no reaction from Steve. She goes to
him to get a better look. You don't have to be a doctor to see
that Steve is quite dead.

CONNIE (cont'd)
Holy shit!

The shock of seeing the body sends Connie reeling backwards.
Accidentally, the gun goes off.

A LOUD KNOCKING is heard from the door, followed immediately by
Bill bursting into the room.

BILL
Are you all right?

CONNIE
You got a helluva sense of timing,
you know that?

BILL
Are you going to tell me what's
going on, or -

He sees Steve lying on the bed. It takes a moment for it to
register... Then a sick look washes over Bill's face as he realizes
that's a dead man on the bed. He looks back at Connie ~ seeing the
gun in her hand,

BILL (cont'd)
Holy shit ...

Bill smiles at her warmly. Connie moves slowly to him, her face

romantic moment. She reaches up to his face - at the last second
she grabs him by the lapels and yells furiously.

him.
CONNIE

I didn't kill him!

Connie sits down on the shoulder, in the gravel, leaning back on
the hubcap of Bill's car, breathing heavily. Bill squats down next
to her, not sure what to say.

BILL

more forthcoming.

CONNIE
Well, I'm not exactly Miss Honesty

He looks at her ... the relief in having this huge secret lifted from
them is beginning to settle in. It's as if they can both take a full
breath for the first time in weeks. Connie sighs a deep sigh, letting
it all go.

as casually as she can.

Nope. . —

He takes her by the arms and looks at her, dead serious.

his, feeling safe for maybe the first time in her life.

Father Brian and Grace are still conversing on the steps as a few

Glorious day, isn't it?

But Grace isn't listening. Her attention is focused on a late
model Ford, parked illegally in front of the church, and on the
rather WEATHERED WOMAN IN HER MID-FORTIES, most definitely not in
formal attire, who steps out of it and walks up the steps. She's
joined by a nervous young man in an equally cheap suit. Together,
they walk right up to Father Brian and Grace.

The woman pulls out a badge with a studied lack of flourish.

Bill speaks up.

BILL
No, I killed him. He was a
blackmailer. I went to pay him off.

Lt. Ambrose pulls out the check.

AMBROSE
With this check?

BILL
Yes.

AMBROSE

(re: Connie)
Which she signed.

BILL
That doesn't matter. I shot him.
CONNIE
a He's lying. I shot him.

Paco runs into the scene.

PACO
Wait!

AMBROSE
I suppose you shot him, too.

PACO
Yes. I confess.

AMBROSE
Well, okay, those of you who shot

him, how many times did you shoot
him?

They all speak at once.

CONNIE BILL GRACE PACO
Once. Twice. Three times. I emptied
the magazine.

There is an uncomfortable silence.

Where did you shoot him?

Okay. Who wants to take this one?
How far away were you?

Connie speaks first.

CONNIE
I was standing across the room and I
shot him. And I'd do it again.

Ambrose decides it's time to cut through the crap. -

AMBROSE
He was shot twice in the heart at
close range. Now I don't know what
the hell you all are talking about,
I just came here to ask about this
damned check. We know who killed
him. We got the killer in the car.

The Winterbournes stand in silence for a moment. Then they stagger
with giddy relief.

BILL
Jesus!

AMBROSE
I don't know what's going on, but if Ir
ever commit a crime, I'm sure as hell
gonna wish I was part of this family.

Connie finally finds her voice.

CONNIE
You're sure you got the killer?

AMBROSE
You want me to be wrong? We got the
gun, we got fingerprints. We even got
a confession, although there seems to
be a fire sale on those today.

She starts to go.

CONNIE
. Why did he do it?

AMBROSE
It's a she. Some lovers' thing. He
knocked her up and tried to dump her.
Same old story.

Connie takes this in.

Ambrose shrugs and points to the Ford parked at the curb. Connie
runs down the steps to the car.

I'm sorry.

Renee shrugs.

Hey, one of us was bound to whack

Ambrose pushes by Connie and climbs into the car.

You guys really got to learn to wait

She slams the door and the car pulls out.

CONNIE
I want to hire her a great lawyer.
One that specializes in those ’sure-
I-did-it-but-can-you-blame-me?’
defenses. .

BILL
Did you know her?

CONNIE
Yeah, I knew her real well.

Connie looks at the disappearing car, seeing this vision of her
former self speed away. She turns and walks up the steps.

Grace is there, watching her. Father Brian is at her side now,
holding little Hughie. Connie walks up to Grace ... there’s so
much to say to her and she can’t think of how to begin. Grace
turns to the others.

GRACE
I‘d like to speak with Patricia
me for a moment.

BILL

It’s okay, Bill.

The others walk back into the church, leaving Connie and Grace
and little Hugh together. Grace turns to Connie.

GRACE
Who was Stephen DeCunzo?

Connie looks up at Grace, knowing the time for the truth has
come and dreading it.

CONNIE
The baby’s father.

Grace's eyes stay on Connie ... and Connie dies a little inside.

barely knew him. I wish I had. an

GRACE
What are you saying?

: CONNIE
I’ve been lying to you, Grace. I
should have told you the truth the
minute we met, but with your heart

and all ...
GRACE

What truth?
CONNIE

We had no place to go. I didn’t
want my baby to grow up like that.
This is the only home I’ve ever had.
I fell in love with you all and I
didn’t want to leave you.
I love Bill so much ...

(hesitates, indicates baby Hugh)
I‘m just ... I’m just so sorry
he’s not really your grandson.

Grace takes this in ... but she knows she loves this girl and
that this girl loves her son. She takes Connie’s hand.

GRACE

(quietly)
He will be. Let’s go.

Grace leads Connie and the baby up the steps of the cathedral.
Grace glances down at the baby, fondly.

GRACE (CON’T)

My heart could stand three or four
more of these.

Connie looks at her expectantly.

CONNIE
Really?

Grace waits for Connie so they enter the cathedral together.

Grace puts her arm around Connie, but not before swatting her
the behind.

FROM ABOVE - The wedding. The music is filling the room.

Connie walks down the aisle, Paco on her arm, giving her away.
Paco is weeping ~ he always cries at weddings.

Bill stands at the altar, watching her. Grace sits in the front
row with little Hugh in her arms.

AT THE ALTAR - Bill and Connie stand before Pather Brian.

FATHER BRIAN
Do you, William Hazard Winterbourne,
take Patricia to be your wife? To
love, honor and cherish for as long
as you both shall live?

BILL
I do.

Father Brian turns to Connie, who seems lost in thought.

FATHER BRIAN
Do you, Patricia Winterbourne, take
William to be your husband? To
love, honor and cherish for as long
as you both shall live?

She looks at him for a beat ...

CONNIE
No.

There is dead silence in the cathedral.
ON GRACE - she looks up - what now?
ON THE WEDDING PARTY - Father Brian doesn't seem to have noticed.

FATHER BRIAN
Do you have a ring to show -

Excuse me?

CONNIE

I, Constance Helen Doyle ... do

The crowd murmurs. Christine and Susan exchange a look. Paco stands
behind her, shaking her head - he'll never figure this woman out.

Father Brian looks around, confused.

Connie glances back to Grace. Grace mouths ‘Who?'
to herself, apologetically. Grace shrugs, ‘whatever, ‘ Connie

Father Brian.
