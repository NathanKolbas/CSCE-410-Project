as the various channels are being surfed. lingering on each for about
two seconds. We see fragmented bits and pieces of different
programs: ‘The Brady Bunch,* "The Facts of Life," an infommercial,
"Too Close for Comfort,* "What's Happenin‘ ?*

Then the channels start slipping past us even faster: Whatchew

QNVIDEQTAPE/TyY INT./EXT. STADIUM - GRADUATION

A sea of hats: the flat black tops of hundreds of graduation caps. A
few of the graduates have decorated the tops of their mortar boards
with masking tape in the shapes of peace signs, dollar signs, Greek
letrers, "U.H.,* ‘Now What?" etc.

Te is a windy buc sunny June morning at the University of Houston.
The graduating students are sitting in rows of chairs. ‘The stands
are full of relatives and friends.

LELAINA PIERCE, early twenties, stands at the podium on stage, in cap
and gown. One day she could be president, if she could just find her
car keys. She is visibly nervous but pasSionate as she reads her
Speech off the index cards she holds.

LELAINA

-~And they wonder why those of us in our
twenties refuse to work an eighty hour week just
so we can afford to buy their

(truly repulsed)
BMW's. Why we aren't interested in a counter-
culture they invented. As if we did not see
them disembowel their revolution for a pair of
running shoes!

{applause}
Yeah, instant karma's gonna get them!

Wild applause from graduates.

LELAINA
But the question remains: What are we going to
do now? How can we repair all the damage we
inherited? How can we outgrow these bankrupr
hand-me-downs? Fellow graduates, the answer is
simple. The answer...

She turns over the index card. A look of panic spreads across her
face. She wildly flips through her other index cards, wide-eyed.
She looks around.
The video camera finds a single index card lying on the stage about
ten feer from the podium. Lelaina curns to go retrieve it, but a
breeze slides under it and gently floats it off the stage.

Lelaina takes a deep breath and faces the waiting audience.
LELAINA
The answer is...

I don't know.

A 1970's song like "I'm Your Boogie Man“ starts up...

ON VIDEOTAPE EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - EARLY EVENING
The video camera is set up on a tripod om the roof. The Houston
skyline is seen in b.g., fiery as the sun is setting. Lelaina,

holding a Diet Coke. dressed in black (she wears all black all the
time unless otherwise noted), looks into the camera.

LELAINA
I'm not a valedictorian. But I play one on tee-
vee.

TROY

We know you slept your way to the podium.

She rolls her eyes and turns around to find TROY DYER, roguishly
handsome, early twenties. He wears jeans and a t-shirt with an open
Button-down over it, A lit cigarette dangles from his mouth. The
one thing sharper than his mind is his tongue.

SUME_CUD

The video camera is now hand-held. A party's going on up here:
Rolling Rock six-packs, pizza boxes, a jambox. on the ledge sit

VICKIE MINER, early twenties, wearing. a bizarre 70's outfit with big.
round sunglasses pushed back on her head, no make-up, her streaked
hair parted down the middle. She is smoking a joint. She has long
since quit giving a damn.

And SAMMY BUCK, early twenties, dressed in both cap and gown.
Riddled with fear and insecurity, he is very handsome, buc he has no
igea.

The camera finds Troy, who sits next to Sammy.
TROY
Okay, Laney, ZI think the moment has been
captured. Now would you get your face out of
the camera?

LELAINA

It's for my documentary!
VICKIE

Her... "documentary. *
LELAINA

Hey, this is going to be the history book of the
future here. You'll thank me when you see
yourself on PBS.

SAMMY

Yeah right. I have a feeling we're all gonna
end up on stage with Bob Saget.

sOMECur
Vickie is behind the camera now, taping Lelaina and Troy and Sammy.
Being stoned, Vickie's camera work is pretty weird: quick zooms,

dutched angles, decapitated people, etc. Lelaina looks into the
Camera, worried.

LELAINA
You sure you can handle that?

VICKIE(0.C.)
Yes!

Lelaina puts her arm around Troy. These two are crazy about each
other, but caught in the mire of a platonic friendship.

LELAINA
I brought you back a souvenir.

She pulls a tassel from a graduation cap out of her pocket and hands
it to him. Troy grimaces.
SAMMY
Troy, you can go back and graduate next year.
You can still get your B.F.A.

TROY
B.F.D. I'm through with the whole wank-a-rama.

He tosses the tassel over his shoulder and off the building--

Lelaina is operating the camera again, taping Sammy, who is freaking
out. Vickie and Troy are trying not to laugh in b.g.

SAMMY
A liberal arts degree--What does that mean?
I'll tell you what it means. It means, “We're
sorry, Sammy, but we're looking for someone
who's able to make decisions. Have you thought
about telemarketing?"

LELAINA(O.C. )
Sammy, just remember this: you can always go to
graduate school.

Sammy stops, brightens as he considers this:

SAMMY
That's true.

There is a reverent pause... Then:

Lelaina smirks, annoyed, but half-expected that.

LELAINA
And you wonder why we never got involved.

TROY

SAMMY
My goal is... that...

Or... is thar cool?

Sammy, Vickie, Troy and Lelaina sit on the ground.

UME _ooD

VICKIE
Four years of college and it's coffee jobs for
all of us. Except Lelaina.

TROY
Hey, a career is not happiness... or is it
“happiness is not a career"?

SAMMY
Except for clowns.

VICKIE
I think happiness is a warm puppy.

Vickie and Sammy talk into the camera, arm in arm.

Yes, and just think: I wouldn't have to just
pretend to be your girlfriend in front of your
parents anymore.

SAMMY

Vickie pushes him away as she doubles over with laughter.

Vickie picks up her Charlie's Angels lunchbox; she pushes her

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

--Dead silence. Everyone is sitting at a table: Troy and Lelaina siz
on one side; PAT PIERCE (early 50's), Lelaina's successful-iooking
dad, is at the head of the table, and CYNTHIA NICKLE (40's),
Lelaina's attractive mom, is at the other end. CAROL ANN PIERCE
(40's), Pat's clipped, business-like second wife, sits at Pat's
right. DALE NICKLE, barely thirty, Cynthia's rough-looking husband,
sits at her left. They are eating, staring into their plates.
Lelaina sips her Diet Coke...

CYNTHIA
Your sister was really sorry she couldn't come.

Lelaina nods.

DALE
That was a real good talk you gave today,
Lelaina.
CYNTHIA
Didn't you think so, Troy?
TROY
Very hip. Very PC.
DALE
What's PC?
CYNTHIA
(chiding)
Oh, Dale, get with it. Personal computers.
LELAINA
Actually, it's ‘politically correct.°
CYNTHIA

I think so too, honey.

Troy and Lelaina exchange looks. Carol Ann looks into her food,
disturbed. She reaches into her shrimp and pulls out a hair.

CAROL ANN
(disgusted)
LELAINA
»»-Maybe it's one of yours.

Pat raises his glass to take a drink. Dale leans over to get a
closer iook at the hair.

DALE
Maybe it's a puber.

Pat nearly chokes on his drink. Dale laughs at his joke. Carol Ann
and Lelaina put down their forks while Troy tries to stifle his
laughter. Cynthia glares hard at Dale.

PAT
..-Well, I guess I'll go ahead and give you your
graduation present.

He hands her a Mobil credit card.

PAT
T'll pay that bill for one year.

Troy whistles as if he's impressed.

LELAINA
Thanks, dad.

Pat looks at Carol Ann and smiles; she nods. He reaches in his suit
Pocket and pulls out a key. He hands it to Lelaina.

PAT
And since Carol Ann got a new Infiniti, we're
giving you her old BMW. You can pick it up at
our house.

Troy smirks. Lelaina is crestfallen; she starts to speak--

CYNTHIA
. --BMW? Pat, didn't you listen to her speech
today? She doesn't want a BMW.

LELAINA
I'll handle this, mom.

CAROL ANN
With your new job, you're going to need a
reliable car.

LELAINA
It‘s not the reliability I--
10

PAT
--I'm not gonna sit here and listen again to
some strange ethical argument about a damn car.
It's got four wheels, ict runs well, and after
you've been in the real world a while, you're
gonna appreciate that car.

TROY
(devilish)
dust think of all those starving children in

Africa who don't even have cars--

CYNTHIA
--Troy, does your father give you gifts like
that?

LELAINA
-.-Mother...

TROY

Actually, my dad's dying of cancer so
I don't really trouble him for gifts.

A silence beaches itself on the table for a moment: Dale is the only
one who continues to eat.

CYNTHIA
See, Pat?

LELAINA
Mother, please.

CAROL ANN

(to passing waiter)

Check.

CYNTHIA
You don't want a BMW. Tell him,
Lelaina.

PAT

(slowly; as if te a child)
Cynthia, she can make her own decisions.

LELAINA
Dad, come on, don't talk to her like that.
She's not a child.

PAT
(laughs)
She married one.

Troy tries not to laugh. Lelaina is stunned. Cynthia is
speechlessly offended and hurt. Dale looks up.

DALE
(mouth full, confused)
Whac?

Cynthia stands up, about to explode--Lelaina grabs her arm.

LELAINA
Dad! 1'11 take che BMW just until I can afford
to buy a regular car myself. Okay?
(he nods; to Cynthia)

Okay?
She nods, and slowly sits back down. Lelaina breathes a sigh of
relief. There is a long awkward silence. ...Then:
DALE
(to Lelaina;: sober)
Get a Ford.

A woman is at the mirrors. Lelaina enters as the woman starts our.

Sammy lovingly though unnecessarily throughout. Sammy is hugging nis
mom goodbye.

SAMMY
I'll be home pretry late, mom.

Sammy offers his hand to Ira, who pulls him into a hug.

TRA
I'm proud of you, son.

Sammy, surprised, nods and backs off, looks at Jennifer.

Nice meeting you, Jennifer.

Vickie puts her arm around Sammy and looks at Jennifer.

The parents exchange looks. Jennifer smiles.

JENNIFER
They are the cutest couple.

CUT TO:
INT. LELAINA'S CAR/EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

Troy and Lelaina are in her Olds Cutlas. Troy tries to put his feer
on the floorboard. which is covered with empty Diet Coke cans. They
clatter around. She fishes in her big purse for keys; she is edgy.
Troy reads her like a book.

TROY .
Lelaina. Don't. Don't let them do it to you.
Not today.

LELAINA
I'm not.

She finds her keys, takes out a cigarette and lights ic.

TROY
It‘s the same meta-farcical Mardi-Gras with my
parents. The difference is, I don't care
because I don't try to run it.

LELAINA
I'm not trying to run it.

She starts the car, backs out.

TROY
Just forget them. Come on, this is your day.
You just graduated. You don't need your parents
anymore. You got the Mobil card, you got the
beamer, under some duress, and I say fuck ‘em.

Lelaina thinks about that, realizes it's true.
(buoyed)
That's true. I don't need them anymore--

TROY
--Like an aneurism, you need them.

LELAINA
I just graduated--

TROY a

She takes a drag as Troy sighs--

TROY

Passing the torch.

laughs with her. She hits Troy, playfully angry:

LELAINA
How mary times do I have to tell you--Don't make
me laugh when I'm inhaling! God! I think you
do that on purpose!

She takes an entire six-pack of Diet Coke out of her purse.
TROY
Hey, I have an idea--Why not have a Diet Coke?
You've only had twelve today.
(she pops one open)
I've always wanted to ask you something: Is
your urine carbonated?
LELAINA
Wouldn't you like to know.
He smiles, extends his pinky; they engage in a pinky-lock.

pours coffee grounds into it.

He slips on his jacket and holds his keys. He looks at

 

Vickie, who is pretending to sleep so she doesn't have to talk wi

under her futon. She flips to a certain page.

 

Names cover it like this: August 31 - Sean Marelli - 64: September 1:

Sammy is in front of the computer, staring into it. The horror, the
horror. Joyce enters and puts a load of laundry on his bed. Sammy

He runs his hands over his head, trying to relax. He pulls out a

his upright guitar, sweating from the set, is conferring with the
four other members of his band. The manager approaches and hands hin
a large jar: It says “DONATIONS FOR THE BAND* and holds about two

dollars in change.
Troy, angry and disappointed, lets his guitar fall to the floor.
EXT. OUTDOOR NEWSSTAND - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Troy is sitting at register, reading Marleau Ponty's "Review of
Existential Psychology and Psychiatry." He looks around: no one's

THE DOWNTOWN SKYLINE AT DAWN - BACKDROP

"Walk on the Wild Side* is drowned out by synthesized, talk-show
THEME MUSIC. This is the set of “Good Morning, Grant:", the local
morning talk show. It is composed of very homey furniture and a fake
fireplace. The AUDIENCE is 99% female. The theme music reaches a
crescendo, and GRANT GUBLER, late 30s, runs out on stage, in a suit.
There is applause. He applauds the audience.

GRANT
Good morning, ladies--and gentleman. I see a
gentleman right there!

He points to the audience. A camera swings to get a shot of an old
man in the front row.

GRANT
Good morning!

Grant wipes at his eyes, choked up.

LELAINA

God, he's so cheesy, I can't watch him without

crackers.
Damien stifles a laugh.

GRANT
Now, let's take a peek inside our Video View,
and see what we have in store for today.

Grant walks to a standing bookshelf, which holds videocassettes. He
pulls one out, looks at it and feigns surprise:

GRANT
It's a special report on children's birthday
party themes. Taped on location at eight-year
old Timmy Rohbin's party exclusively for our
Video View collection.

Grant walks over and sits on the couch.

GRANT
So come sit with me. Relax. Have a cup o'joe.

He reaches for his coffee mug. It isn't there. He looks around--
it’s nowhere. He looks into the camera, scared like an animal caught
in headlights. He skips three bears.

LELAINA
Oh shit.

She looks at the producer, RICH CARDOUCHE, an overweight man with the
stub of a stogie pinched between his lips. He looks at her, shrugs,
throws his hands up in exasperation.

GRANT
Anyway--it's gonna be a good morning!
(big applause)
You're beauciful!

The THEME MUSIC starts up. A BUZZER sounds.
DAMIEN

We're clear.
Grant rushes over to Lelaina--She knows what's coming, turns away,
but Grant grabs her arm.

GRANT
Am I here to amuse you, Miss Pierce? Am I here
to make you laugh? Is that the real reason I'm
on this show?

LELAINA
Look, Mr. Gubler, when I do cue cards, you're
supposed to get your own espresso. Didn't you
get my "Espress Yourself" memo?

GRANT
I don't have time for your little mind games.
Just remember, we're laying people off, and =
can find an intern who will do your job for free

Grant storms back towards the set. Lelaina looks at Cardouche,
worried. He puts a supportive hand on her shoulder.

CARDOUCHE

An index card with a project title is tacked up under each date. one

DIET.* The Friday spot is blank.

Cardouche is sitting on a desk, holding a blank index card. Lelaina
stands beside him with her clipboard.

CARDOUCHE
Your job is going to be combined with Damien's
since he has seniority.

This takes a minute to sink in; her eyes are wide with panic.

LELAINA
I won't have a job here anymore?

He just looks at the floor. She swallows hard, thinks a second,
looking at the index card in his hand. She takes a deep breath.

LELAINA
Look, I know there's a staff opening on the
Video View. And I have some videotapes I made,
sort of a documentary, that really shows what I
can do. I know it would be a perfect segment on
the View. It's about my friends.
CARDOUCHE
I don't knew. Honestly, Lelaina, = don't see
how that's relevant--~

LELAINA

CARDOUCHE
What?
Lelaina thinks fast, mentally tap-dancing:
LELAINA
I mean, it's AIDS, and environmental stuff and
it's like. you know, the housing shortage, and-~
and eternal recessions and it's very issuey.

CARDOUCHE
Issuey?

LELAINA
Oh, yeah. I mean, I mean, like how we inherited
more problems than opportunities.
He looks at his blank index card, bending it back and forth.

LELAINA
We're the... the Reparation Generation.

She holds her breath. He hands her the blank card; he's sold.
CARDOUCHE
Okay, look. Go ahead and give ic a shot. If
it's good, I'11 put you on staff.

Lelaina wasn't really expecting this:

LELAINA
Really? I mean, I mean, for real?

CARDOUCHE
Of course it's for real.
LELAINA
Oh, thank you Mr. Cardouche!~-I promise it‘ll be

great!

He has to smile at her salesmanship. He leaves. Lelaina breathes a

Vickie waves back. The woman is still admiring herself in the
mirror. Vickie looks back at Lelaina and sticks her finger in her
mouth, gagging-~the woman looks at Vickie--who slyly acts like she's

Lelaina and Vickie are having a great time, singing and bouncing

reading a map spread over the steering wheel as he searches for -he
CD he wants as he tries to talk on the phone:

MICHAEL
Can't we just negotiate with--?... You know
what?--He's lying. Well, we should probably
Call his bluff--wait, I gotta figure out where I
am, I think I'm lost or--What? No, listen, he
needs us--He makes music videos, we show cthem--

--He starts to swerve into the left lane as he reads the map-~A car
HONKS loudly at him--He straightens out--

MICHAEL
{into phone)
Yeah I'm here, I'm just lost--I think I'm lost.

He stops at a red light. tLelaina stops beside him. Vickie and
Lelaina look over at the scattered Michael, then they look at each
other and giggle.

The light changes. Lelaina pulls forward and carelessly tosses her
cigarette out her window...ic flies about two feet...and lands on
Michael's seat. He doesn't see it; he looks over--

MICHAEL
Well I'm not scared of--Jesus!--~

v7and sees the cigarette discoloring the leather. He picks it up and
leans over to throw it out--and swerves his car into the other lane--
and rams the fender of her BMW.

Lelaina, stunned, looks over at him: he’s still on the phone.

MICHAEL
--What?--No, my god, I just got in an accident
--I'm in an accident. I'm okay, I think I‘m
alright. No, I gotta go--my thing is, my fender

Lelaina doesn't move. Vickie tries to discreetly shut the
overflowing ashtray.

Tt was my fault, wasn't it? Did you see what
happened? A cigarette flew into my car like a,
a ballistic missile or something. Did you see?

~-The ashtray finally closes, exploding, and ash flies everywhere.
Vickie and Lelaina start laughing hysterically, really out of
nervousness. Michael gets it.

MICHAEL
Oh. Okay. Great. This is... great.

They can't talk, they're laughing so hard. He can't help but be
somewhat amused by this..

MICHAEL
Are you guys like... stoned or something?

They laugh even harder.

reads the logo on the wall. The office is a mess: a blizzard of
Papers, faxes, CD's, extra phones, etc. Lelaina has stopped
laughing. She stares at a ceramic bank/statuette of Dr. Zaius from
"Planet of the Apes" on his desk. Michael paces behind his desk,
talking into a telephone headset.

MICHAEL

Well, she can say whatever she wants, but we
don't have to show it. I don't care if she does
twelve books of herself naked, that doesn’t
mean~~-,.. Fine, but that's not my decision. I
don't have time--Look, I'm trying to set up an
operation down here. .

(to Lelaina, friendly)
That‘’s Dr. taius. ‘Planet of the Apes.°*
She smiles, nods, picks up the bank.

MICHAEL
You can't do that!-~Don't do thac!

LELAINA
(puts it back)
I'm sorry, I didn't know--

MICHAEL
--What? Hold on--Lelaina, I'm on the phone.

Her face flushes with embarrassment; she looks down.

MICHAEL
{into headset)
Well then tell him J said so.

He presses the hang up button, sighs heavily, looks at her.

MICHAEL
Sorry about that--Can I get you anything?

Lelaina still thinks he's on the phone; she looks at the floor,
examines her nails, etc.

MICHAEL
Lelaina, I'm talking to you now.
{she looks up)
Hi.

LELAINA
Hi.

MICHAEL

(apologetic, sheepish)
Let me just tell you the situation here. I got
my lawyer guy telling me that I have to sue you?
For damages? Not that I want to, but my rates
are screwed if, I mean, I hate to...

(off her look)
What?

She‘s trying very hard to remain calm.

LELAINA
When you say “sue*--?

MICHAEL
--Uh-huh?

LELAINA

You mean like for money ih a courtroom?

MICHAEL
I don't know--I've never done this before. Do
you have a lawyer or anything?

LELAINA
A lawyer? I don't even have a hairdresser. 1
only make four hundred dollars a week and--

MICHAEL
~-What do you do?

She starts to answer, but his intercom BEEPS. He presses the talk
button, signals Lelaina just one second.

MICHAEL
Yeah?. No, I can't talk to him right now.
(hangs up, to Lelaina)
Sorry it's so crazy; we're trying to get the
channel set up down here, and it's just...
Anyway, what did you say you do?

LELAINA
Actually, I work in television too, at the “Good
Morning, Grant’ show. Maybe you've seen it?

MICHAEL
(thinks)
Oh, wait--yeah, with that: *Good morning, good
morning*--What's the deal with that guy?

LELAINA
He's kind of a psycho.

MICHAEL
Well, I really feel really bad about this whole
thing-~Maybe I can get you some CD's?--we just
got the advance on the new Sting thing.

LELAINA
(smiles)
The "Sting things?

MICHAEL
Well, I don't know, it's packaged
environmentally, in like recycled tree bark or
something.

He laughs; she just looks at him curiously. There is a definite
cre action between them, though an awkward silence here: he goes for
the save:

MICHAEL
You know what? Forger the lawsuit or whatever,

the whole deal. Forget it. I don't know, I'll
get in trouble, =I don't care. It was probably
my fault and you seem very sweet and... you like
Dr. Zaius, huh?

LELAINA
Oh yeah--He's really cool--

~~She picks him up again, looks at it. She puts it back, but only
haif on the desk as she looks at Michael-~-

MICHAEL
--Yeah, this friend gave him to me, he‘s like
this walking encyclopedia of *Planet-~--

~cand before she can catch him, Dr. Zaius falls and breaks into
several pieces on the floor--Lelaina gasps--

LELAINA
--Dr. Zaius!

Michael just stares at the floor in disbelief. She quickly bends,
starts gathering up the pieces, trying not to cry.

MICHAEL
That's okay. He was just a collectaor's--

LELAINA
(whimpers)

--I can glue him back--I'm sure I can just--I
think this is his head.

She tries to fit the pieces together, but no matter how hard she
presses, they just don‘t fit. She tries them in a few different
positions. Michael watches her, somehow charmed.

MICHAEL
I think he's gone.

LELAINA
God, I'm like ruining your whole life.

MICHAEL
No, you're not, not at all.

She looks up at him; their eyes lock.

MICHAEL
Just don't touch anything elise.

He laughs. She laughs with him. He clears his throat, kneels down
beside her.

You know, I'd really, I don't even... But
listen, you want to go out sometime and get a
cup of something...?

She smiles up at him, pleasantly surprised.

But with an edge.

Vickie takes the card and looks at it, thinking.

VICKIE
So it is a date?

LELAINA
Oh yeah.

VICKIE
Are you going out for dinner?

LELAINA
For coffee.

VICKIE
And dessert?

LELAINA

I think just coffee.

VICKIE
Caifes or cappuccino?

VICKIE
Hmm. I'm sorry, Laney, but it doesn't sound
like a real dace.

Lelaina stops at the door, confused, kind of bummed out. ‘Then she
looks at Vickie, who has on a Cheshire cat grin. Lelaina smiles as
she realizes Vickie was stringing her along.

LELAINA
You little mind-fuck.

She just smiles, opens the front door--and sees Troy standing there
with a hand-dolly, about to exit.

He will turn this place into a den of slack.

Troy gathers up his stuff. Sammy and Vickie look at Lelaina,
betrayed. Lelaina looks at Troy: she sighs, giving in.

VICKIE
It‘s cool, Troy. Welcome to the maxi-pad.

TROY

My parents got divorced when I was five, and I
only saw my dad about three times a year after
that. When he found out he had cancer, he took
me here. He handed me this big pink seashell
and he goes, "Son, the answers are inside this."
And I'm all, “What?* Then I realize that it's
empty, the shell is empty. There is no point to
any of this. It‘s all a random lottery of
Meaningless tragedy, a series of near escapes.
So I take pleasure in the details. A Quarter

LELAINA
Mr. Gubler, do you have time to take a look at
what I've done here?

GRANT
(totally ignores that)
I need my questions.

She expected that. She hands him a sheet of paper.

LELAINA
Here's the research I did. You should really
try to read it--this guest has quite a history
in politics.

Grant skims it in a nanosecond, then tosses it in the trash.

GRANT
Just give me my questions.

Lelaina shakes her head and gives him a stack of index cards.
INT. TV STUDIO - MORNING SHOW SET - MORNING

Grant is on stage with a guest, a newspaper EDITOR: their interview
is in progress. Lelaina stands next to Damien, following Grant on
her clipboard.

EDITOR
--In fact, in today's paper, we have a special
insert devoted to the problems in the Fifth
Ward.

As Grant says anything to a guest, he discreetly reads it off
notecards on the coffee table.

GRANT

The Posn seems alot more liberal than the
Chronicle. How do you feel abour that?
EDITOR
How do you feel about it?

Grant looks at the cards, kind of laughs.

EDITOR
What do you think, Grant?

GRANT
{not off cards)
I think... it's...

Cardouche holds his breath. Grant is unprepared for this; he looks
around. Lelaina runs into his line of sight. She gives him a cthumbs-
up and neds, exaggerated, as if to a chimp.

Grant mimics her, mods and gives an exaggerated thumbs-up. The
audience applauds. The editor smirks. Cardouche finally breathes.
He puts a thankful hand on Lelaina's shoulder.

Thank you.

She smiles, proud.

Vickie, Troy and Sammy sit around the set, zoning out, sharing a

Lelaina is overjoyed. She shrieks, hugs Vickie.

LELAINA
I'm so proud of you! You made it happen!

VICKIE
Well, it really happened by default. The old
manager tried to kill herself: she ate a whole
pot of poinsettias.

But anyway, I got a raise, and I hired Troy to
work for me part-time.

Vickie takes a drag off the joint, thinking.

VICKIE
What exactly were their principles?--I‘ve never
been really clear on that.

Troy and Sammy look at each other, a little unclear themselves.

LELAINA
Didn't you people ever watch ‘Family Ties"? It
was all explained on “Family Ties‘.

The parents were hippies.

They all nod, ‘oooh*, like this makes total sense. Vickie passes the

Vote or Goat?

MICHAEL
It was a promotional at In Your Face TV to get
young kids to vote. We called up random people
and asked them if they‘d registered to vote, and
if they hadn't, chen we showed up at their house
with a camera crew and gave them a goat. Kids
were really freaked cut. We gave out almost cwo
hundred goats, and who wants a goat, right?
Anyway, it was a big success.

LELAINA
And you thought of the whole thing?--That's
great.

He puts the photo back in his waliler.

Well yeah, I know it sounds kind of ridiculous.

Well, you know, look where I work. We have to
compromise ourselves to get by.

MICHAEL
Yeah, I think it's definitely important to have
your own things.

they form an idencity without any real role-

Wow. Yeah, you know, that's true. And your

Troy, yeah.

He's trying to subtly mine this information.

No, no, no--It's me and Vickie. He just needed
a place to crash ‘cause he got fired from his

MICHAEL
He stole Snickers bars?

LELAINA
Yeah, but he can rationalize it, like, the
establishment owes him a Snickers.

He's trying to get a handle on this guy, but there's no way around
it: he's going to have to just ask:

MICHAEL
And he has--Does he have a girlfriend?

LELAINA
Oh my god, same here exacriy.

MICHAEL
I remember being so happy on the roof of our old
house, just staring at the sky. I want to do
that again, you know, just look at stars and
smell, you know... everything, I've just gotta
find the time.

LELAINA
No, you have to make the time to do those
things. Honestly, it seems like you work so
hard thar if you don't just look at the stars,
you'll totally lose perspective.

MICHAEL

I know, I know. It's like, do you ever have
those moments in life where you just feel okay?
Where you just find yourself happy in a moment
and you go, "Oh,. I'm happy here’? And then it
goes away? Like really quickly? I always seem
ge forget those moments, but I've had a couple
of them.

LELAINA
Yeah, me too. ...Like right now.

She caught him off-guard: he smiles, realizing that this is indeed
one oF nose moments. They are both suddenly aware of the chemistry
at wor! ere.

MICHAEL
Yeah. Like right now.

He leans in and kisses her softly, just for a couple of seconds.
They look at each other, then she kisses him. They start to really
get into it; they slide down into the seat without breaking. The
Opening strains of ‘Beth" by Kiss fill the car... When his car phone
RINGS. He opens his eyes, looks down, torn. Lelaina's like the
Energizer bunny: still going. It keeps ringing. Michael picks ic
up, but as he talks, Lelaina continues to softly kiss him.

Yeah. No, the video is, um--Doesn't he know
it's set at a pre-apocolyptic bomb shelter?
What's the difference, pre or post? Well they
should've thought of that before they shaved his
head--

--She cuts him off, kissing his mouth.

MICHAEL

Look, uh, I gotta, I can'’t--I'm about to go

through a tunnel.

He doesn't even hang up; he just drops the phone and passionately
responds to her.

Troy walks up the alley, partied out, heading home. He hears ‘Beth';
he stops. He sees the Saab and the two forgetten Big Gulps sitting
on it. He quietly walks over to it. Michael and Lelaina are inside,
wrapped around each other.

His face registers no dramatic change of emotion, just the slightest

She eyes him threateningly.

you rationalized sleeping with a yuppie-head

LELAINA
He is not a yuppie!

TROY
He is the reason Cliff's Notes were invented.
He thinks DesCartes is something you put before

He takes his book back, starts reading calmly.

I can't believe this. I'm getting dressed for
work. What am I doing? God.
She sits down, slides the towel off her head, dejected.

MICHAEL
Well I have money--

LELAINA
--I'm not gonna take your money--

She takes a Diet Coke out of her purse.

MICHAEL
~-I'm not saying you have to...

She pours the Diet Coke. He tries to read her.
MICHAEL
(almost frustrated)
What is it?--Is it that, I mean, is 2roy gonna
get pissed off that you're actually doing
something fun and not being all like miserable
with him or--

LELAINA
(very irritated)
What are you talking about? My God, this has
totally zero to do with--I mean, Troy doesn't
have anything to do with anything at all, Jesus
Christ.

MICHAEL
“Jesus Christ." Okay. Alright, I was just...
(sighs)
I probably shouldn't even try to give you this.

Michael hands her the cassette he made.

MICHAEL
I don't know, this whole thing has just been--I
haven't made amyone a tape since I don't even
know when, when I was seventeen and acne and
here I am, twenty-six. I just, I never met
anyone like you before.

Genuinely touched by the gesture, she kisses him softly.

MICHAEL
it's got KISS and I don't know why, but I stuck
the Hershey's jingle on there:

(sings)
Nothin' like the face of a kid eating a
Hershey's bar, nothing like it you'll...

She reaches out and gently touches his face, charmed.

LELAINA

(soft)
--Michael, I love this. But I just can‘t go,
okay? I just can't do it. I'm sorry.

MICHAEL
Alright, forget it. I just thought it would be
fun and funny and you and me, that's all.

He starts out, hurt. She looks over and sees that snow is still on
the TV. She turns the set off and follows him:

Now. What do you know about industrial
filmmaking?

LELAINA
Well, I was a communications major, I--

INDERVIEW.#2: INT. RADIO OFFICE - DAY

There is a sign on the wall: “KRBE-FM". ROGER sits behind his desk.
He lifts a bottle of nasal spray to his nose, and sprays some in each
nostril. Lelaina sits across from him, waiting.

ROGER
To be honest with you, Lelaina, I think you're
overqualified for this position.

LELAINA
(a little desperate)
Oh, I don't know. I'm not really that smart.

INTERVIEW #3: INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

An office in the Houston Chronicle headquarters. LOUISE a burly
woman, sits behind a desk cluttered with papers. Lelaina sits on the
other side of the desk, waiting.

LOUISE
No offense, sweetie, but you don't have
experience on a paper. You're tee-vee.
LELAINA
I'm trying to make the transition to print
journalism.

LOUISE
Why?

LELAINA
(prepared)

Newspapers are the last watchdogs of our
government--they enforce the checks and
balances. And a half-hour of tee-vee news only
adds up to one page of newspaper copy. And this
country is turning away from their local papers
to their tee-vees for info-tainment. I want to
help turn that around.

Louise raises her eyebrows, very impressed.

LOUISE
Well then. I just need to ask you one test
question.

LELAINA
(confident)
Of course.

LOUISE
Define irony.

LELAINA
Irony?
(she nods)
Irony. Iromy... It's a noun that means when
something is... ironic... Um, it's... like...
like... that... I don't... I really can‘t
define irony, but I know it when I see it.

Lelaina's eyes light up; she's very happy to see him. She makes her
way across the cafe. She waves at him, smiling:

LELAINA
Troy! Troy!

He’s surprised to see her, though not necessarily pleasantly. She
reaches his table, sits, talking a mile a minure:

LELAINA
Thank god--I have never been so glad.to see
anyone in my life. You would not believe what
I've been through, Troy, okay? Those
interviews, okay? The word “vivisection* is a
staggering understatement. I mean--Hey, can you
define irory?

TROY
It's when the actual meaning is totally opposire
from the literal meaning.

She slaps the table.

LELAINA
I knew that. I knew it. God.
TROY -

So... where's Mike?
LELAINA
What?--No, no, he's not here, I'm just... I’m

She eats a chip. There is an uncomfortable silence.

TROY
I should get back to work.

LELAINA ~
Wait a minute. Isn't there some statute of
limitations on embarrassing incidents?

TROY

Your bravado is embarrassing.

He marks his page and stands up. She grasps onto his arm.

you can sit with me for one cigarette. Just one
cigarette, some conversation, you and me and
five bucks, right?

No way. Is this the same jerk who locked you

LELAINA
That is so bad for your asthma.

PATTY
I don‘t ever smoke them, Lelaina. I sell them,

Lelaina hands her a pack from her purse and they sit down.

LELAINA
So how are you?

SAMMY
But, Thelma, what about your bullshit
principles?

She just shrugs.

TROY
You can't take my sister away! You'll have to
get through me first!

[roy jumps in front of Michael and starts hopping around, throwing
exaggeratedly feeble punches, doing wildly ineffective karate chops.
The CANNED LAUGHTER is raucous. Michael simply walks around him,
Thelma opens the door, and they leave.

INT. LELAINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
...The phone is ringing as Lelaina slowly wakes up, still wearing
yesterday's clothes and make-up. She tries to pick up the phone, but
her hand can't get a grasp on it: it's asleep. She slaps it, pinches
it until she gets a little feeling. She answers it:

LELAINA
Hello?

INTERCUT:
INT. PHONE BOOTH/EXT. CROWDED STREET - SAME

Michael is standing in a phone booth, but he talks on his cellular
phone.

MICHAEL
Lelaina. Hi--Did I wake you up?
LELAINA(V.0.)
Michael!?
MICHAEL

Listen. Don't kill me. Okay, I took your tape,
I showed it. Don't--just--They freaked out.
Okay? They want to do it, they want to buy it--
They want more stuff, more tapes.

LELAINA
sits up, excited, but still trying to make sense of this.

MICHAEL (V.0.)
Do you hate me? I'm sorry, really.

LELAINA
They liked ic? For real?

MICHAEL (V.0.)
What am I, gonna make it up? They pyschotically
loved it. Is this okay? I mean, I know it's
not PBS, but-- ‘

She stands up, swallows, excited. She smiles.

LELAINA
Qkav!? Are you kidding? I was this close to
selling fruic at intersections.

MICHAEL

MICHAEL
Well, don't, don't. Just keep working, and I'll
be there in a few days, and I'm like, I'm
thinking about you every second here--

MICHAEL
I'm, where am I? I'm in a phone booth.

LELAINA(V.O.)
Why are you on a cellular phone?

That's a good question. He thinks.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM ~- MOMENTS LATER

Lelaina's on the couch, putting a tape in her camcorder, dusting the
lens, etc. Her camera case is opened on the coffee table. She
closes it and finds Vickie's notebook underneath. Curious, she picks
it up. She looks around, then opens it:

most names have been "X"d out, the word "CONDOM" written over them.
A couple have a big question mark beside them.

INT. VICKIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lelaina worriedly enters Vickie‘s bedroom, notebook in hand. Sammy's
lying on her bed, resting his chin on his hands, wearing dark shades.
He is eye to eye with Vickie's phone.

LELAINA

SAMMY
She wouldn't let me go with her.

LELAINA
Where is she?

EXT. CLINIC - LATER

Vickie emerges from the clinic, stone-faced. She walks down the
steps, but stops, surprised, when she sees

LELAINA

in the distance, waiting for her. Lelaina sees Vickie. They just
pook at each other for a moment, then Lelaina begins walking towards
er...

Vickie comes down a few steps. As Lelaina approaches...

VICKIE
What are you doing here?

LELAINA
What am I doing here?--I'm freaking out worried
about you.

VICKIE
(almost disbelief)
Really?
85

LELAINA
I'm sorry, Vickie. I'm sorry about being such a
macro~bitch. God, 1 just kept thinking how you
have that cold and... I started to think, you
know...

VICKIE
...2'm sorry too, Laney.

There is a quiet moment; Lelaina is trying to read Vickie...

: VICKIE
You know, I don't know why I keep thinking about
this, bur remember sophomore Thanksgiving when
we bounced a check on that thirty pound turkey?

LELAINA .
(hesitates)
Yeah?

VICKIE
{nastalgic)
And we tried to cook it on the hot-plate-~-

LELAINA
--Uh-huh.

VICKIE :
And then we went to Popeye's with that sock full
of nickels. Goddamn. I wish we could do that
again.
Vickie sighs nostalgically; Lelaina is now very worried, interpreting
Vickie's sentimentality to mean the worst--She grabs Vickie's
shoulders--

. LELAINA
--Vickie, what are the results?

VICKIE
(dismissive)
Oh, negative.
Lelaina half-laughs, relieved:

LELAINA
Oh god. Why didn't you just tell me?

Lelaina laughs; Vickie laughs with her as they hug.

LELAINA
Hey, are you hungry?

VICKIE
I'm starving.

LELAINA
Then fuck it: Let's go to Popeye's right now.

VICKIE

Okay.

Lelaina puts her arm around Vickie as they walk off.

SAMMY
Yeah. I'm going to get my master's in... the

I was always terrified of the "Permanent

school, "This will go down on your permanent

into a job interview and the boss would look at
my permanent record then ask me, ‘Well, Mr.

you going to talk when I'm talking? Are you

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Troy is reclined on the couch, absorbed in "Aesthetic Theory” by
Theodor Adorno, smoking, looking a little grunged out. Michael pokes
his head inside...

MICHAEL
.+-Hello?

Troy looks up and finds Michael standing there, dressed in a nice
suit, looking very handsome.

MICHAEL
Hi, how ya doin'--Sorry to just walk in, but
your door's open and--

TROY
--Lelaina's getting dressed.

Michael sits down on the arm of the couch, then decides tc stand,
very uncomfortable under Troy's disdainful stare.

MICHAEL
I'll just--I don't know if she told you, but 1
was just up in New York with the tapes she made,
and the stuff she shot of you is really, it's
great stuff. The whole thing about nobody
eating the eggs...

TROY
I was quoting.

He goes back tc his book.

MICHAEL
That's okay, it's still, you know, and anyway,
the airtime will be a good thing for your band

Hey That's My Bicycle.

Troy looks up, just for a second, then goes back to the book, lets
this one slide: too easy.

MICHAEL
‘Cause we're really into new bands at the
channel, especially underground.

TROY
I'll remember that next time I'm on a subway.

Michael thinks abour thac first, then courtesy laughs. Then he
wonders if he should've laughed at all. He looks at Troy, irritated.
starts to say something, but

Lelaina enters, and for the first time, she is not dressed in black.
She wears the light-colored crochet dress. She looks stunning, but
She doesn't look like herself. Both Troy and Michael almost gasp.
Lelaina stops, looks at them watching her.

LELAINA
What?
TROY
What happened to your normal clothes?
MICHAEL
Wow. Lelaina, look at you. Where‘d you get
that dress?
LELAINA

I don't know, I just bought it, I thought for
the premiere and stuff I should--It looks
stupid, doesn't in?--I'll go change.

She starts out, but Michael stops her.
MICHAEL
No, no, you look beautiful. You look like...I
can't even think of, like, like...

TROY
A doily.

LELAINA
I'm gonna change.

MICHAEL
No, don't, don't change.

Lelaina.

Michael turns on Troy:

MICHAEL
Hey, man, what is your glinch?

Lelaina takes Michael's arm, pulling him towards the door.

LELAINA
We're already late, let's just--

MICHAEL
~-No, wait a minute, whoa, hang on a second. If
you have a problem with me, I mean, let's just
get this out. Do I like offend you? Have i
stepped over some line in the sands of coolness?
Well excuse me if someone doesn't know the
secret handshake with you.

There's no secret handshake. There's a secret
IQ prerequisite, but there's no secret
handshake.

MICHAEL

Wha--You--oh man, wait a minute.

TROY
Hey. Rest those synapses.

LELAINA

Troy just laughs: Is Michael really this lame?

LELAINA ‘
Just ignore him!

Done. No.

They both look at her; even she isn't sure whom she was addressing.
Michael takes a breath, calming himself.

MICHAEL
Look, let's just--let's go, Lelaina. You don't
need this.
They go to the door.

TROY
You don't know what she needs.

Michael takes the baic.
MICHAEL
Oh, I think I know what she needs in a way that
you never will.

LELAINA
My god!--Whar is--

TROY
(dismissive, waves him off)
Ah, fuck you and buy me dinner.

Well someone should.

For once, Troy does not have a comeback. He is rendered mute.
Lelaina leoks down, caught, embarrassed. Troy smirks, then walks out
of the apartment, slamming the door behind him.

Lelaina is standing alone at the back of the room, very nervous.
Michael approaches, holding up a remote control.

MICHAEL
You ready?

She nods. He dims the lights. People look over, stop talking.

Okay everybody. It's a special night, ‘cause as

affectionately.

LELAINA
I'm just a bill, yes I'm only a bill, and I'm
sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well it's--

TROY
How'd the big premiere turn out?

LELAINA
Great. It turned out really great.

She knows he knows she's lying. She stands up. He follows her as
she walks into

where she gets a Diet Coke from the fridge. He watches her as she
takes a sip, then rubs her face, tired.

LELAINA .
They're just...videotapes anyway. Who cares?

just me.

He rubs her back, friendly.

LELAINA

I know it's stupid, but it really meant
something to me, you know? It wasn't like gonna
end nuclear war or anything, but it meant
something to me.

He puts a caring arm around her. She's trying hard not to cry. He
gently caresses her cheek.

Honey, the only thing you have to be by the age
of twenty-three is yourself.

LELAINA
I don't know who that is anymore.

TROY
Ido. And we all love her. I love her. She
breaks my heart over and over, but I love her.

He pulls her into a hug. She holds onto him like a life-raft. ‘Troy
helds on to her tightly. He kisses her cheek. Then he kisses her on
the mouth, very passionately. She responds equally passionate.
without thinking. They break. He presses her against him; he smells
her hair, breathes deeply. Then he kisses her again, hotly; they
really fit like this. They look like they're melting together.

INT. LELAINA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Troy and Lelaina are on her futon, nude; he is passionately kissing
her neck as they make love. Her eyes are closed as she abandons
herself. She clings to him, moving with him, digging her fingers
into his back. He looks at her face.

TROY
I've wanted you like this for all these years.

LELAINA
So have I.

He kisses her mouth fervently.

Troy as Greg Brady.

The door to the room flies open, and in walks a woman with cropped
blonde hair carrying an armful of laundry. It's Vickie as Carol

Honey, you can‘t sleep with your brother. We've

told you that.

LELAINA
I'll never do it again--I promise.

Mike Brady walks into the room: he is Michael. He shakes his head,
sighs, walks to the bed.

MICHAEL
I expect a little bit more from you than this.

It's been building up for over four years, Dad.
She just couldn't help herself.

Well, you're grounded. Both of

He stops, stares at her.

No. I'll see you tonight.

He starts out again, but stops. He goes to her and gives her a
mechanical, perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

She walks towards the stage-~-but is stopped by a hand grabbing her
arm: it's Sammy, sitting at a table with Vickie.

SAMMY

Tell me it's not true.

She just looks down. Sammy is shocked: Vickie grabs her hand.

He's getting his doctorate in Medieval History.

Lelaina watches Troy as he steps down from the stage. She starts
off--but Vickie pulls her back.

VICKIE
{low)
Lelaina, it really means alot to Sammy that you
like Luke. Do you know what I mean?

Lelaina looks at Sammy and Luke together. Luke lights a Dunhill,
French inhales, John Waters style. She gets it.

VICKIE
So don't run off yer.
Lelaina sees Troy across the club, gerting coffee.

LELAINA
Okay, okay. Let me just--hold on.

Lelaina again starts off, but doesn't get two steps before she hears
from behind her--

MICHAEL (O.S.)
~-Lelaina?

She does a mental one~eighty as she remembers the date with Michael.
She feels a hard rock in her stomach. She slowly turns to find him,
holding a brochure and two plane tickets. He's pretty wound-up.
Vickie and Sammy stare at him, shocked at his presence.

MICHAEL
(to Vickie and Sammy)
Hi. Hi.

Lelaina is speechless. He moves in close to her. She watches Troy,
who hasn't seen her yet.

MICHAEL
(excited)

Don't say anything-~Look, I screwed up. I'm
getting your tapes back. It's not definite yer,
but listen to me. I want to make this up to
you, you mean so much to me, Lelaina. I got us
two tickets for the Red Rock Trails in Arizona.
We'll go hiking in the desert, just like you
wanted.

TROY

is still at the bar. He watches with complete and total disdain,
almost disbelief, as Michael takes
LELAINA'S

hands. She quickly looks back at the bar for Troy... but he has
left. There is no sign of him.

MICHAEL
This'll be great for us because you were right,
we need to get away and get perspective on
everything.

LELAINA
Michael, I don‘t--~
104

MICHAEL

~-Listen, you and me after a long hike and we're
sweating together and we'll get a saltscrub and
just peel off all the layers, scrub them off and
get down to you and me. I'm telling you, look,
they've got...

(shows her brochure)
...two o'clock canyon explorers, three o'clock
meditation--or, or we don't have to do anything.
They have wallyball too.

LELAINA
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

She frantically scans the club for Troy.

MICHAEL
I'm talking about giving me another chance here.
I serewed up, alright? I know, I'ma jerk, look
at me, I'ma jerk, alright?

LELAINA
Listen, there's something I should tell you...

Lelaina looks around, getting panicky...

MICHAEL
Oh. Hi.

-.-and she bumps right into Troy.

TROY
{mock surprise)
Well hi Lelaina.

LELAINA
Hi.

TROY
Is that a frog in your throat or are you just
glad to see me?

(very nice)

Hi Mike. Thanks for coming down. No hard
feelings, man.

Troy offers his hand, as a truce. Michael thinks a second, then
shakes it. Lelaina is frightened by Troy's congeniality. He knows
this, and he loves it.

TROY
Lelaina, you're looking a little pale.

MICHAEL .
Yeah, are, are you okay? -.
VICKIE
{trying to help out)
She's fine--She just had too many Diet Cokes
today.

TROY
Yeah, this girl is koo-koo for Cocoa Puffs--So
are you gonna tell him or am I?

He is looking at Lelaina, though he keeps that polite smile on his

face. She feigns confusion, but Troy's gaze is relentless.

weighs her options... Troy starts whistling the theme song from

“Jeopardy*. Lelaina is suddenly incensed, livid.

LELAINA
{low but acidic) :
Why do you always have to be so funny! ?
--Why is it so goddamn important for you to be

funny! ?
TROY
Because it‘s all I've got. Isn't it.
LELAINA
{to Michael)

Excuse me one second.
She takes his arm and leads him off to the
PHONE HALL
by the bathrooms.

TROY
You want to tell me what the hell he's doing
here!?--I wanted to talk to you.

LELAINA
What the hell do you care? You totally bailed
on me this morning!

TROY
I panicked. It happens. But I thought we could
work it ouc, you know? Okay, look, I don't know
if this is the right time for us. I mean, I
meant everything I said last night, but...

Lelaina glares at him coldly.

TROY
--Would you--Don‘t lock at me like that. Jesus,
I’m not saying, you know, okay?--I mean, I know
you're the only woman I could ever commit myself
to.
106

LELAINA
So what--do I get a medal? <= won che Great
Commitment Cook-off and you just run away?
(beat)
I knew this would happen.

TROY
I don't want to lose you. I don't know, i've
never had an experience like this before. I've
never--

--She sneers, turns away from him. He grabs her wrist and turns her
ro him.

TROY
I've never had sex with someone I loved before.

She wrests her hands free.

LELAINA
Well, congratulations Troy Dyer. Welcome to the
world of the emotionally mature. It's a nice
place to visit--you might bump into Michael, he
lives there.

TROY
Yeah right, Michael's so mature hecause he lets
you navigate that entire relationship. Well I'm
sorry, but you can't navigate me, Lelaina. I
might do mean things, I might hurt you, I might
even run away without your permission and you
might hate me forever. And I know that scares
the shit out of you, because I'm the only real
thing you have.

Lelaina is struck by this, but incensed. A long beat; she glares
hard at him.

LELAINA
Fuck you to tears.

She walks away, livid. This isn’t what Troy wanted.

TROY
Lelaina--wait a minute--wait! Lelaina!

BAND MEMBER (O.S.)
Troy, we're on.

Troy watches Lelaina as she reaches the table and sits next to
Michael. She scoots her chair closer to him.

A beat. Troy turns and delivers a solid punch to the wall.
107
BACK AT THE TABLE

LELAINA
Michael, listen, I'm sorry-~

MICHAEL
--No, iim sorry. I‘m sorry. Don't you get it?
That's what all this is.

Lelaina opens her mouth to say something--

MICHAEL
(charming, almost laughing)
~-Huh-uh. Listen, you and me, we'll saltscrub
it all away.

Troy and the band take their places on stage and warm up. He looks
at Lelaina who's sitting close to Michael.

TROY
(smiles viciously)
This one's for you, Laney.

Lelaina holds her breath... The guitar begins the intro to ‘The Fuck
Song," a raucous song by Olivia Cornell.

TROY
(Singing)
Well, you ever hear the word fuck, baby?
You ever hear the word screw?
How ‘bout me? How ‘bout you? How ‘bout now?

People begin clapping along. Lelaina looks deeply stung. She closes
her eyes. Vickie looks down, embarrassed for her. Michael is
starting to wonder about all of this.

TROY
Well, I see that look in your eye,
and you know thar it’s been in mine
How ‘bout grabbin' for the gold?
Just put your mind to it
You better damn well do it
before we both get old.

Pretty soon, the audience is going wild, some standing on their
chairs, singing along. Lelaina can no longer stand it. She quickly
walks off, towards the front doors as the song relentlessly
continues. Vickie jumps up, rums to Lelaina, but she waves her off.
Michael looks from Lelaina to Troy and back to Lelaina as she
disappears out of the club.

He gets what's going on. He stands up, angry.
108

MICHAEL
(to himself)
Goddammit.

He walks out of the club as the song finishes. Luke looks act Sammy,
confused. Sammy leans over to him and whispers in his ear. Luke
gasps. Then he shakes his head.

LUKE
The worst thing the Middle Ages gave us is the
concept of romantic love.

EXT. CLUB/INT. BMW - SAME

Lelaina is in her car; she takes several deep breaths, calming
herself down. She puts a cassette tape in. Lolly. Lolly. Lelly from
“Schoolhouse Rock" begins. .

LELAINA

(sings along)
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, get your adverbs here.
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly, got some adverbs here.

She backs out.
AT THE CLUB ENTRANCE

Michael watches Lelaina's car drives out of the lot. Tray bursts cut
of the club, leoking around for Lelaina but he only finds Michael,
whom he purposely ignores as he walks toward the street.

MICHAEL
{to Troy's back)
Nice job. Very well done.

TROY
I don't want co hear it. Not from you.

MICHAEL
Yeah well, I forgot I'm not qualified to talk to
you-~Sorry I can't be Mister Hey-look-at-me-I‘m-
Buddah-on-the-mountaintop. But you know what
you are? You know what you remind me of? That
guy in the hat with the things, with the bells,
the uh, uh--

TROY
--Court jester.
MICHAEL
Yeah, where everything's so easy to laugh at
from a safe distance in CleverCleverland. But
you know what happens to him? They find his
skull in a grave and they say, "I knew him, and
he was fumny.* And the guy, the court jester
dies all by himself.

TROY
Where'd you hear that? The Renaissance
Festival?

Michael shakes his head in disbelief: that‘s his whole point. troy
turns and faces Michael.

TROY
Besides, everyone dies all by himself.

MICHAEL
If you really believe that, then why are you
standing out here in this parking lot with me?

Troy turns away, walks off. Michael remains, unmoving. He hears
Troy's engine starting. He looks at the

Plane tickets in his hand as “Walk on the Wild Side’ starts.

Lelaina enters the Gap, disconcerted, looking around for Troy.

Vickie’s at the counter, bagging a sale. Lelaina approaches her.

Dejected, Lelaina leans on the counter.

Lelaina is lying on her futon, holding the tape Michael gave to her.
She rolls over and puts it in her boombox, presses play--

Troy sits alone in the empty, sterile waiting room, under a ‘No

He rubs his face, exhausted.

He goes to the pay-phone and dials. He waits...

LELAINA(V.0.)
Hello?

He hangs up. He leans against the wall.

There are five chairs arranged in a circle: Pat and Cynthia are

COUNSELOR
Paccy would like to share something with you in
this week's session. Are you ready to share?

PATTY
Forget it--I was just hanging out, okay?--I was
bored. My roommate had this bottle of Final
Net, and I was just curious to see what ic
tasted like.

Lelaina closes her eyes, disappointed. She puts a comforting hand on
Patty's back.
COUNSELOR
So you did not drink that hairspray for its
alcohol content?

PATTY
No!

The counselor holds up a brown paper bag.
COUNSELOR
Patty. Put your bulishic in this bag and level
with us.
Patty dramatically puts her hands to her head.

PATTY
Oh. My. God. I'm spinning--I'm spinning.

COUNSELOR
Find your center. Find your center.

Patty closes her eyes and finds her center.

PATTY
I drank the hairspray because... I'm dying.

Lelaina exchanges worried looks with her parents.

COUNSELOR
Patty, tell us why you're dying.

Patty suddenly starts to cry.
PATTY
Because I don't want to get out of this place
because I don't have a family to come home to!

Lelaina bows her head empathetically. Pat stands up. He walks over
towards Patty--when Cynthia stands up. .

the divorce while 1 was waiting because I

Pat takes the bait; he turns and looks at Cynthia, infuriated.

PAT
Dammit, Cynthia!--You filled their heads with
that kind of crap then sent them off to me for a
weekend, no wonder they're confused.

LELAINA
Stop it!

CYNTHIA
they're confused because their daddy doesn't
care about anything but golf clubs, cars and

I‘m about to walk right out of here.
CYNTHIA

Well, darlin’, what the hell is new?
PAT

That's it--

LELAINA

Shop it!

Everything stops... Everyone looks at her, taken aback. She stands
up. She looks at all of them as if for the first time. She almost

laughs.

LELAINA
I am so sick of you people, I could throw up. I
have tried so hard--se hard--to make everything
okay, but I quit.

She picks up her purse.

CYNTHIA
Honey, nobody ever asked you to make amything
okay.

PAT

My god, Lelaina, what are you talking about?
You've gotten almost everything you‘ve ever
wanted, we never hit you--
LELAINA
--What a big accomplishment. Oh, gee, thank you
SO much for never hitting me, you just scored
extra bonus points, Pat.

She's never talked to him like this before.

CYNTHIA
Your problem is you never had to suffer.

LELAINA
Right, okay, I never had to suffer. God, look
atus. I can't believe that we ever even lived
in the same house. Or went to Disneyworld or
watched “Little House on the Prairie* together.
It's like ict never happened. Family portraits
hidden away. Polaroids cut up. New furniture,
new dishes, new moms and dads, kids split in
half. You two can't even look at each other,
she's drowning herself in Final Net, and I...

She starts to tear up, despite herself. Bur this time she doesn't
run into the bathroom; she stands her ground and makes them watch.

LELAINA
-».God, I'm still taking out the trash. Who am
I if I'm not the one taking out the fucking
trash? I don't even know.

There is a reverent pause. A deep~seated chord has been struck in
all of them. They know it's crue. Lelaina takes a deep breath, like
a brick has finally been lifted off her chest.

LELAINA
But I'm gonna find out. I know it’s net your
fault, and I know you did your best, but I've
gotta get out of here, at least for a while, I'm

proud.

Vickie and Lelaina exchange surprised looks.

EXT. TRANSCO TOWER - WALL OF WATER - HOURS LATER

Michael and Lelaina walk in the park area in front of the huge,
modern-art fountain across from the mall. Lelaina is a little
nervous, glancing at her watch as Michael is intense, excited.

MICHAEL
--Then on the sixth day, I went on the
overnighter, just me and a bottle of water in
the desert. Lelaina. I looked at the stars
again, I made the time, like you said, and I
really got perspective--I smelled everything--I
smelled sand-~I never knew sand had a smell.

LELAINA
(pleads)
Michael, can we talk about this after I get off
work? I mean, I've been gone almost three
hours--Vickie’s gonna kill me.

MICHAEL

T just want to get to this one point, which is
when they made me do this regression thing?--I
mean, I know it's ridiculous, but even if you
don't believe in thac crap, I don't even believe
in ict, but it told me that when we were like in
ancient Egypt or something, you were like a
slave, and I was like this unhappy slave-master
guy, I think--I don't remember everything ‘cause
Iwas kind of in this trance, but the upshot of
it is that I was crowding you. So what I need
to do now is give you space. And that's good,
because I need to be by myself too, and I'm so
okay on my own right now. We just need space.

LELAINA
Okay. Alright.

This was not the answer he wanted.

MICHAEL
Really? Okay... I mean, it's space. and I
think we can still see each other with the
space. Like, within the space.

She sighs; this isn't going to be easy.

LELAINA
Listen, I still want to be friends--

He stops walking; so dees she.

MICHAEL
--Look, I know I'm serewed up, okay? I know
what I am, and I'm not perfect. No one is--
well, except, to me, you're very close.

She didn't want to hear that; she looks down, painfully.

LELAINA
No, I'm not.

Ke takes out a bracelet made of stones on a leather strap.

MICHAEL
I made this for you. The guy who regressed me,
Hector, he said the stones are supposed to mean
that you care about somebody.

--No, you know what? JI don't even care. I
Mean, I care, but--Look, you want to come with
me?--Why don't you come to New York with me? No

forget it.

LELAINA
You know, I bet ten years from now, we'll be
laughing at this. We'll be cracking up.

MICHAEL
Yeah, I'm sure at some distant point in the

future this will all seem really hysterical. It
kind of already does seem funny to me.

No--not. No,

She tries not to, but she laughs infectiously. He shakes his head,

SAMMY
Thank God!--Come on, we gotta hurry-~-

hi?

Troy is sitting on the floor in the middle of the store. playing his
guitar, singing Sugar Mounrain by Neil Young. His guitar case is
open in frone of him; there is some money in it. Some customers
watch him; Vickie is desperately trying to lead them away from him.

SAMMY
He won't leave. He's been sitting there for
hours, going through the whole Neil Young
songbook. He's almost through with the S's. I
don't know what's gonna happen when he gets to
the end.

Vickie comes up to Troy.

VICKIE
That's it, Troy. You have five minutes to
vacate this mall. Then I'm calling security and

having you physically remeved from the premises!

Troy finishes the song. A passing customer tosses a quarter in his
guitar case. A beat. Vickie holds her breath. Then Troy starts
Playing again: This Qld House.

VICKIE
You will be arresred.

Lelaina steps in, shocked.

LELAINA
Vickie!

Vickie takes Lelaina by the arm and leads her off to the side.

VICKIE
Panhandling is illegal inside this mall. If
Troy isn't out of here, I have to call in
security or close the store. If I close the
store, I'll lose my job.
(desperate)
Lelaina, I cannet lose my job.

Lelaina turns to the scattered customers: Troy‘’s audience.

LELAINA
Okay, folks, show's over.

Customers toss money into Troy's case as they back off; Troy still
keeps playing.

Lelaina approaches him; he does not lock at her as he finishes the
song. He doesn't say anything for awhile. He looks at her, then
turns the page of his Neil Young songbook... Lelaina turns and walks
towards Vickie, who cringes.
TROY
Lelaina.

She turns back, goes to sit next to him. They are quiet, then:

TROY
...When I was about eleven, I was already
playing guitar. I learned from my older
brother, ‘cause he was always playing old
Beatles songs on his. And one day in December,
I heard on tee~vee that John Lennon died. That
he was assassinated. I don't know why, but fT
felt like, suddenly, there was this... evil
force in the universe that I never knew before.
So I went and sat alone with my guitar in my
room. I wasn‘t playing, I just held it. Then
my father knocks on my door and walks in. And
he comes over and sits beside me on my bed. I
thought, ‘This man knows what I'm feeling right
now. Without a word spoken between us, this man
knows exactly whar I'm going through." So we
sat there for a minute. Then he turned to me
and said, "Son?" And I said, “Yeah, Dad?" and
he looked at the floor and said, ‘Jack Lemmon
was killed.*

She starts to laugh. He kind of laughs with her... their laughter
dies, and he looks at her.

TROY
My dad died.

Her mouth drops open. She embraces him. He lets himself he held.
He bites into her sleeve; his face contorts, but he won't let himself
ery.

TROY
My mom didn't even bother to show up at his
funeral.

She hugs him tighter, Elooded with empathy and love. He can't hold
back anymore and cries. She just holds him, stroking his hair,
rocking him back and forth. She starts crying too.

LELAINA
Oh, Troy, I would plan your funeral.

TROY
I'm sorry, Laney.

LELAINA
It's okay, it's okay.

LELAINA
No, the whole thing's done. It's on the air

But, hey, who knows when PBS will come knocking?
You gotta start somewhere. And until then, I'm
right here. In the stop-Gap.

TROY

You know what I think our whole problem is?

We need to get our own place.
LELAINA

With what money?

TROY
Well...

He looks in his guitar case.

TROY
I have about five bucks.

She leans in and kisses him on the mouth. He responds passionately,
hungry for her.

LELAINA
Then fuck the world.

Fuck the world.

He stands up, cffers her his hand. She takes it and stands up, and
they hug. Vickie mins to them. Sammy mins and hugs all of them.
