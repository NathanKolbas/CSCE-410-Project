Credits.

A bright, sunny day. An attractive young woman rides
her bicycle through Central London. Her hair blows
free, and she is relaxed and contented. Occasionally,
she waves and smiles at passers-by.

She gets off her bicycle and chains it to some
railings, alongside some other bikes.

Now she is walking through a busy market. She glances
briefly at a stall, then notices a bookshop. She looks
in its window.

A moment later, POPPY, for that is her name, enters the
bookshop. Looking round, she spots a book, and smiles.
She pulls it out a little. It’s ‘The Road To Reality’
by Roger Penrose.

POPPY
‘The Road To Reality’. Don't wanna be
going there!

(She laughs to herself. A young male shop assistant is
working behind the counter. He wears a woolly Rasta
hat, and has a beard and dreadlocks. He is white.)

POPPY
Hiya. Oasis of calm in here; mad out
there.

(No reply from the assistant, who is preoccupied with
his computer.)

POPPY
Gorgeous day for it, though, isn’t it?
(She moves away, into the shop.) Never
been in here before.

(Poppy enters the children's book section. She picks up
a brightly coloured book called ‘Kingdom Of The Sun’.
She opens it, and smiles.)
A few minutes later, in another part of the shop, she
is reading an adult book. The ASSISTANT comes over and
puts some books on a shelf next to her.

POPPY
I like your hat.

(He reacts a little as though she's said something
outrageous, then slopes off. She glances after him.)

A few moments later, POPPY drifts over to the counter.

POPPY
Busy? (He ignores her.) Hello! (Still
no response.) ‘Avin' a bad day?

(He looks at her. Pause.)

ASSISTANT
No.

POPPY
Ooh! Not ‘til I showed up, eh?
(Laughing) You look like a rabbit
caught in the headlights. I won't
bite! Don’t worry: I’m going now. Have
a good day! Stay happy! (She opens the
door. Cockney accent) “I ain't nicked
nothin’. Honest guv’nor!" (She makes
the sound of a burglar alarm.) Beep!
Beep! Beep!

(She laughs. As she leaves, a youth with long hair and
spectacles enters the shop.)

Poppy walks briskly back to where she parked her
bicycle. It has been stolen.

POPPY
Oh, no - no! Come on! (She looks
round. Lots of people and traffic, but
no bike. She laughs.) That’s just
brilliant, that is! Oh, no! I didn’t
even get a chance to say goodbye.

(She walks off.)
A large, packed dance hall. Spotlights. POPPY and four
other young women are bopping energetically to ‘Common
People’ by Pulp.

Dawn. An empty street. The five women meander along,
chattering. A taxi drives by.

They arrive at a flat over a corner cafe and enter a
side door.

A little later. We are in POPPY’s living room -
cluttered, eclectic, jolly, jokey. Daylight, just,
through the closed curtains, but the lights are on.
POPPY, ZOE, her flatmate, SUZIE, POPPY’s sister, and
DAWN and ALICE, SUZIE’s friends. Much laughter and
giggling throughout this scene.

DAWN
The music’s stopped.
ALICE
It stopped ages ago. (She bursts into
giggles. )
ZOE
(Smoking)

Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.

(ALICE and POPPY shriek with
laughter.) What? What’s so funny?

ALICE
I don’t know!

(SUZIE, in a multi-coloured anorak with the hood up,
has been dozing.)

SUZIE
Can you just - (She makes a gesture
that sort of means “make less noise”. )

ZOE
Oh, your sister’s woken up, Poppy.

(POPPY imitates SUZIE's gesture - forefinger and thumb
half an inch apart.)

DAWN
Suzie, what’s that?

ALICE
What is it?

POPPY

Is that your latest conquest? Aah -
bless ‘im!!
(POPPY, ALICE and DAWN laugh.)

ZOE
Don’t you ever pray that you were
adopted, Suzie?

POPPY
(miming being stabbed)
Ooh! Oh!
SUZIE
Yeah!
POPPY

You got me, Zoe!! (She pulls out the
imaginary dagger. ALICE and DAWN
giggle uproariously. )

SUZIE
S-ssh!

ALICE
Who are you shushing?

POPPY
No, no! No, no. No, she’s
right...let’s all enjoy the silence
together. Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in!

(DAWN and ALICE make ‘ssh' sounds.)

DAWN
Sorry.

ALICE
Fingers on lips. (She does so.)

POPPY
Fingers on the tits. (She does so.)

ALICE
Fingers on tits. (She does so.)

POPPY
(Pointing to her lower
region)
Fingers on the lips.

DAWN
(to ALICE)
Can I borrow yours?
(She puts her finger on ALICE's
bosom. )

(ALICE squeals with mirth. POPPY pulls out two pink
rubber breast pads.)
POPPY
Fingers on the tits!

ZOE
Oh, that is properly disgusting!!

POPPY
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone? - ooh:
hello? (She puts a pad to her ear like
a telephone. )

DAWN
Can I have a go?

POPPY
(Handing it over)
Course you can, Dawn - you don’t need
to ask! Anyone, over there?

(She chucks the other pad over to the
sofa, where it lands between ZOE and
SUZIE.)

ZOE
I know where that’s been.

(DAWN is putting the pad inside her dress.)

ALICE
(Laughing)
You have gone down in my estimation.
POPPY
Oh, I’m sorry, Alice!
SUZIE
I don’t get why you wear’em, Poppy!
POPPY
Oh, don’t you?
SUZIE
I mean, you just...put them in your
bra...
ZOE
Yeah?
POPPY
I like the way they make me feel,
Suzie!
ZOE

Like a natural woman.
POPPY
That’s right.

DAWN
(inspecting her own bosom)
I think it’s in t’wrong place!

(ALICE prods DAWN's bosom.)

ZOE
Oh, look - you've got three tits.
POPPY
She’s like you, Zoe!
ZOE
No, that’s three nipples.
POPPY
Oh, right.
SUZIE

Have you got three nipples?
(Zoe laughs.)
POPPY

She doesn’t like to talk about it! I’m
going to give her a little hug.

(She crawls across to ZOE on all
fours.)

(ALICE pats POPPY on the bottom with her shoe.)

ALICE
Over you go!

POPPY
Oh, that’s quite nice - do it again.
(ALICE does so.) Oh!!

(Much giggling all round. POPPY climbs onto the arm of
the sofa, and squats behind ZOE.)

Look at your cleavage! It looks great
from up ‘ere!

ZOE
(Drily)
Thank you!
POPPY

I’ve got a bird’s-eye view! Come on
ladies! Cop a load o’ this!
ZOE
Oh, yeah - roll up! Roll up!

POPPY
Look at that!

(ALICE and DAWN gather round.)

ALICE
Oh - they’re great.

ZOE
It's good, isn’t it?

DAWN
They're amazing!

(POPPY indulges in a bit of jokey slapstick: she falls
off the sofa, winding up in a bizarre position with her
head between her feet. Laughter.)

ZOE
I think we know where Poppy’s sleeping
tonight!!

Viewed from an upstairs window, DAWN and ALICE link
arms as they walk away from the flat.

A little later, in POPPY’s bedroom. POPPY opens the
curtains. She has shed her exotic clubbing appearance,
and is wearing jeans and a top.

POPPY
Time to get up, Sleepy-Head.

(Suzy is in Poppy's double bed. Poppy sits by her. She
is carrying two mugs.)

POPPY
Cuppa tea here. Come on - you can do
it. (SUZIE sits up slowly.) That’s it.
Nearly there! There we go... and she’s
up!! Hey! (She gives SUZIE her tea.)

SUZIE
Thanks.

POPPY
You alright?

SUZIE
Yeah. I slept good.
POPPY
I heard you. (She makes a snoring
sound. )

SUZIE
You always start that. (POPPY laughs)
I don’t snore.

POPPY
I know. You never have.

SUZIE
I don’t!

POPPY
(Funny voice)
“I don’t!”

(Pause. They sip their tea.)

SUZIE

They still asleep?
POPPY

No, they buggered off ages ago.
SUZIE

Did they?
POPPY

Yeah.
SUZIE

Oh, right. What’s the time?
POPPY

About ten past twelve.
SUZIE

Oh. They’ve got a bit of work to do.
POPPY

Have they?
SUZIE

Dawn's late with her dissertation.

POPPY
Oh, no! When are your exams?

SUZIE
Three weeks tomorrow.

POPPY
You’1l be alright.
SUZIE
Yeah. I’m totally chilled out about
it.
POPPY
Course you are.
SUZIE
I’m cool...
POPPY
Yeah.
SUZIE
I’m just really stressed.
POPPY
(Laughing)

What like an Eskimo with a headache?

(ZOE appears at the door.)

ZOE

Does anyone want any toast?
SUZIE

Yeah!
POPPY

Yes, please.
SUZIE

With marmalade - two slices.
ZOE

Yeah, I know - cut on the diagonal.
SUZIE

Yeah.
POPPY

No crusts.
ZOE

Got it. Oh - d’you know what?

POPPY
Oh!

(Hung-over, ZOE makes for the bed and flops on her back
at POPPY'S and SUZIE's feet).

ZOE
Oh, yeah...
POPPY
(Laughing)

She’s gone!
10.

SUZIE
The thing is, we're starting with
Criminal Justice.

POPPY
Is that your first exam?
SUZIE
Yeah - it’s crap.
POPPY
Yeah.
SUZIE

If we had Cyber Crime first, or like,
Crime and Pleasure, I could ease
myself into it. No probs.

ZOE
Oh, you’ll be alright, Suzie.

POPPY
Yeah. If we can get a degree, any
idiot can.

ZOE
Are you calling your sister an idiot?
POPPY
I’m calling you an idiot.
ZOE
Thank you.
POPPY
Crime and Pleasure. Now that sounds
good.
ZOE
Sounds like last night.
SUZIE
Yeah.
POPPY

You’1l be alright.

SUZIE
Yeah.

A little later. SUZIE opens the front door, and steps
into the street. POPPY leans in the doorway.

SUZIE
See you later.
11.

POPPY
Alligator. When are we going to see
Helen?

SUZIE

Oh, yeah. When’s the baby due?

POPPY
I dunno - soon. She’s been texting me.

SUZIE
Me, too. She’s getting worse.

POPPY
I know - bless her. Don't you want to
wait ‘til after your exams?

SUZIE
I want to get it over with.

POPPY
Alright. Don't worry. Leave her to me.

SUZIE
Text me, yeah? (She walks off.)

POPPY
Work hard. (SUZIE makes a rude
gesture, without turning round) Sooze!
(SUZIE turns round.) You know it’s
that way, don’t you?

SUZIE
Oh, yeah.

(SUZIE does a joke sideways crab-walk out of sight.
POPPY laughs. Then SUZIE reappears, and resumes her
earlier direction. POPPY watches her for a moment, then
comes in, closing the door.)

A little later. POPPY takes some old wooden rods out of
a hall cupboard. She is also carrying other assorted
sticks, paper and egg-boxes. She climbs a small
staircase, coinciding with ZOE, who is coming down the
main staircase with an armful of books. Both women go
into the living room. POPPY dumps her load on the
coffee table. ZOE sits on the sofa and opens a large
coloured children’s book.

Now POPPY comes down the stairs, with a further arm-
load of assorted items, included a toy seagull, and
plenty of books. Again, she unloads on the table.

A few minutes later. POPPY and ZOE are now both on the
sofa. Each is looking through a coloured picture book.
12.

POPPY

Be amazing to fly, wouldn’t it?
ZOE

You reckon?
POPPY

Just - phooo!
ZOE

What, like ‘Mr Vertigo’?
POPPY

Oh yeah. I love that book.
ZOE

Yeah.
POPPY

Oh, vultures. Met a few of them.

ZOE
These could be useful. (She gives
POPPY her book.)

POPPY
Oh, yeah - they’re great! Oh, look at
him - he’s gorgeous!

(ZOE holds up some pictures of owls.)

ZOE
We could do an owl - they’ve got big
heads.
POPPY
Good idea. Huh! Got your eyes, look!
ZOE
Oh, cheers, Poppy!
POPPY
No, they’re lovely. Do penguins
emigrate?
ZOE
What, do they move to the Costa del
Sol?
POPPY

Alright - emigrate, migrate -
whatever. What about parrots?

ZOE
Oh, yeah - definitely.
13.

POPPY
Or a toucan. (Looking at picture.) Oh,
look at his beak.

ZOE
They’re good colours.

POPPY
Beautiful.

(Pause. They turn pages.)

ZOE
So, are you going to get another bike,
then?

POPPY

Oh, no. I couldn't replace my old
Lovely. He’s flown the nest, now.
Definitely going to learn to drive,
though.

ZOE
Gonna book lessons?

POPPY
Might do, might not.

ZOE
I told you - you’re not learning to
drive in my car!

(POPPY gently mocks this with funny chicken noises.)

POPPY
Chickens - we could do chickens!
ZOE
Chickens don’t fly.
POPPY
Lazy buggers! What are we gonna make,
then?
ZOE

I don’t know - what d’you think?

POPPY
I dunno.

Now ZOE has a large brown paper bag over her head. Her
forefingers are pointing to the position of her eyes.
POPPY is armed with a big felt-tip pen.
14.

POPPY
Where are they?

(She puts two fingers on the bag.)

ZOE
Here.

POPPY
They’re that far apart, are they?

ZOE
Yeah. Don’t poke me!

POPPY
I wasn’t going near you.

(She draws two dots. ZOE takes off the bag. POPPY has

one, too. They each proceed to cut holes in the bags
with pairs of scissors.)

ZOE
You should ask an adult to help you.

POPPY
(Smiling)
I don’t know any!

POPPY rushes down the stairs. On her head is her paper
bag, now decorated with eyes and a beak and some
colours. She is draped in a large piece of boldly
striped fabric, and is making squawking noises and
flapping her arms. She sails across the room to a large
mirror that is leaning on the mantelpiece.

POPPY
I think they’re quite good.

(Z0E is still on the sofa, head unadorned.)

ZOE
Yeah. What d’you reckon? (She puts her

bag over her head. It too has eyes and
a beak.)

POPPY
(Raising her bag to reveal
her face)
I think we could pull in these.

ZOE
Definitely.
15.

POPPY
Pub?

ZOE
Hair of the dog.

POPPY
I’m ready. Put a bit of lippy on, and
away we go!

(The bag-mask back over her face she makes bird-
tweeting noises to her reflection.)

The next day. An urban environment. Old buildings. Lots
of parked cars. A small, yellow Fiat pulls up. ZOE gets
out, and takes a large cardboard box and a bag out of
her boot. A woman passes her.

ZOE
Hi, Liz.

LIZ
Hi, Zoe. How are you?

Meanwhile, POPPY is standing in a crowded bus, which
jolts suddenly. POPPY laughs, sharing the moment with a
friendly middle-aged man in a suit. She is holding
various bags and rolls of coloured paper.

She runs along a line of trees and a wall. She goes
through a pair of high yellow modern gates, and enters
a low building.

Now POPPY is standing in front of a large, brightly
coloured home-made map of the world. She is teaching a
class of seven-year old children.

POPPY
And birds that live here, in North
America, they fly all the way to South
America. Yeah? Now that’s a journey-
and-a-half, isn’t it? But the biggest
journey of them all is of the Arctic
tern; cos he flies from the Arctic,
yeah? - all the way - wow! - across
the world! - to the South Pole. Isn’t
that incredible? From the North to the
South Pole, and that is - sssh! - and
that is, nine thousand, three hundred
miles - that’s right! Wow. Wow!!
16.

A little later. POPPY crosses her classroom. She
carries plastic paint bottles. She speaks to an unseen
kid.

POPPY
Alright, Nick? You can do the other
side, now.

The kids are making bird masks from their paper bags -
cutting out, painting, gluing. POPPY is sitting at a
table with three kids, helping one of them.

POPPY
What we can do...Shall we give him -
shall we give him a few bits - ? D’you
wanna give him...?

A few minutes later. A boy at another table is painting
his mask purple. POPPY picks up the mask she’s been
working on.

POPPY
He’s got eyebrows, look. (She laughs)
Yeah? (The kids laugh.) I think that’s
brilliant. That’s brilliant!!

Meanwhile, in her school - a different one - ZOE is
supervising her children and their mask-making.

ZOE
Now, then...Shall I put some more
yellow in that? (She refills a pot.)
There we go. What colours d’you think
your feathers should be? You’re gonna
do a rainbow colour? That's a good
idea, isn’t it?

CHILD
I’m doing rainbows.

ZOE
Do rainbows - rainbows, like
parrots... Don’t do that one yet. (She

sits at a table.) Finished it? Let’s
have a look. Little bit more - what
about the little fringe in there?
17.

ZOE

You can do a little more on the fringe
in there, couldn’t you? (To another
kid.) You're hungry? It’s going to be
lunchtime soon, isn’t it? But I’m not
a cook. We’1ll be going to lunch in a
minute. (To a girl.) You can wash your
hands.

Back in POPPY’s classroom, all the kids have their
finished bags on their heads and are standing up.

POPPY
Who’s ready?!!

CHORUS POPPY
Me!! Hey!!

(POPPY leads them all in flapping their wings, jumping
up and down and making exuberant bird noises.)

POPPY
Oh, wow! That's fantastic! Look at you
go! Woh!! Flap your arms! Flap your
wings!!

(They do so. Great fun all round.)

Later, in POPPY’s now empty classroom. TASH, another
teacher, is sitting on a desk, examining one of the
masks, while POPPY packs away her lap-top etc.

TASH
Bit dangerous, innit?

POPPY
What?

TASH

Putting these over their heads.

POPPY
I’m trying to suffocate them. That’s
my goal. Little buggers.
18.

TASH
They look great.
POPPY
How was your weekend?
TASH
Crap.
POPPY
Oh, no! Why’s that, then?
TASH
Didn't do much. Just stayed in,
really.
POPPY
It’s the weekend, Tash!
TASH
I know! I had a run-in with my mum...
POPPY
Did you?
TASH

Mm. My sister was working Saturday; I
had to look after Jasmine.

POPPY
How is she?
TASH
That girl eats too much.
POPPY
Bless her!
TASH

She ate three chicken legs and four
jam tarts, and then wants to tell me
that she’s starving.

POPPY
The little piglet!
TASH
I dropped her off to my mum’s...
POPPY
Yeah?
TASH

I said, basically you've got to tell
Cherie-Ann that she’s got to put this
girl on a diet!
19.

POPPY
Give her a complex - she’s only seven!

TASH
All of a sudden, Mum doesn’t want to
get involved, for the first time in
her life.

POPPY
Right!

(POPPY is now fully loaded with her stuff, ready to

leave.)

TASH
Then, I’m just leaving the house, and
my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

POPPY
Oh, no!

TASH
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
(POPPY laughs. TASH does a Jamaican
aunt voice) “Tash, you got a
boyfrien’? You gettin’ marry soon? Why
don’t you give your mother another
grandchile? You know she nearly sixty!
She gettin’ old!” (Sympathetic mirth
from POPPY.) I was like, “No, I
haven't got a boyfriend; no, I won't
be getting married soon; and, no, I
won't be investing in a property with
a mortgage in the near future. Thank
you very much. And I just closed the
door and left.

POPPY
End of.

(They leave.)

A gym. POPPY is bouncing on a trampoline. Several young
women and men are doing the same.

ZOE is stirring a wok in the kitchen. POPPY comes in,
wearing a dressing gown, and with a towel on her head.

POPPY
Are you cooking?

ZOE
Yeah, are you cooking?
20.

POPPY
I’m cooking with gas, baby. What are
we having, then?

ZOE
Food!

POPPY
Oh - makes a change!

ZOE
Are you hungry?

POPPY
I’m ravishing.

ZOE
Aren't you, just?

POPPY
Thank you!

(She pours two glasses of orange juice from the
fridge.)

ZOE
So how did it go today?

POPPY
What, with our flying flock of little
feathered friends?

ZOE
Yeah.

POPPY
Yeah, it was good - they loved it!
Flap-flap-flapping away, they were.

ZOE
Were they?

POPPY
Yes, bless ‘em!

ZOE
I had to nip it in the bud with my
lot, before they went nuts, and flew
out of the window.

POPPY
It was okay, though, was it?

ZOE
Oh, yeah - I played them Stravinsky
after lunch, just to calm them down.
21.

POPPY
What d’you play?

ZOE
Rite of Spring.

(POPPY laughs)

POPPY
I booked my first driving lesson.
ZOE
Did you?
POPPY
Yeah.
ZOE
When is it?
POPPY

Twelve o’clock, Saturday.

ZOE
Excellent - well done, you.

POPPY
I’‘ll set the table.

ZOE
Yeah, it’s nearly ready.

(POPPY takes out two plates, picks up the orange juice,
and goes out.)

A busy, trendy bar. A light summer evening. POPPY, ZOE
and TASH, dressed for a night out, are sitting at a
table with their drinks.

ZOE
Oh, I love the end of the week.
POPPY
You don’t say!
ZOE
Yeah, I do actually.
POPPY
Oh, do you?
ZOE

Yeah.
22.

POPPY
Oh!

ZOE
You know I take this dance class on a
Friday afternoon, Tash, for Golden
Time?

TASH
Yeah.

ZOE
I swear to God, like, half the kids
are bigger than me.

POPPY
That's not hard, though, is it, eh?
Titch?

ZOE
No, I don’t mean taller. I mean wider.

POPPY
Well, you want to be careful - you
know: you don’t want the kids jumping
about, expressing themselves - bit
dangerous!

ZOE
Yeah.

TASH
Well, you do all that on Friday, but
then they spend the rest of the
weekend indoors, glued to their
Nintendo DS.

ZOE
Totally. Right, a couple of weeks ago,
I came in on a Monday morning - I told
Poppy, right - sat the kids down for
Carpet Time, asked them what they’d
been doing over the weekend...

TASH
Yeah?

ZOE
Really gorgeous weather. Not one of
them had been out - they’d all been
sitting at home on their Play
Stations.

POPPY
And then you couldn’t get them off the
carpet again.
23.

ZOE
Yeah, when they did get up, they were,
like, wheezing.

POPPY
Well, that’s pollution for you.

ZOE
We always used to go to the park.

POPPY
Yeah, but a lot of them don't have
parks to go to.

TASH
Yeah, exactly.

ZOE
Yeah, I know, but then again you don’t
need a park to go for a walk.

POPPY
Yeah, but if Mum and Dad don’t go out,
the kids don’t go out.

TASH
Yeah, a lot of parents are too
frightened to let the kids play out.
Even a bit of green outside their
estate, they don’t let them play
there.

POPPY
Yeah, but it’s hard for a lot of mums
and dads, isn’t it? I mean, they’ve
had a hell of a week, they’re under a
lot of pressure and stress -

ZOE
Tell me about it!

POPPY
They get back from work - if they've
got work to get back from. You
know...a lot of them are single mums.
They’re exhausted. It’s completely
understandable if they don’t take
their kids out for a lovely picnic
with strawberries and cream.

TASH
Yeah, but it’s not acceptable. I know
life’s hard. If you want to find a
way, you find it, innit? Some parents
just can’t be bothered.

POPPY
Yeah, I know.
24.

ZOE
Yeah, so instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat-rooms.

TASH
Yeah.
ZOE
Yeah - that’s worrying.
TASH
Scary.
POPPY

Makes me so angry!

TASH
You know, a lot of seven-year-olds
know more about the Internet than we
do.

POPPY
Well, at least people are talking
about it. That’s a good thing, isn’t
it?

ZOE
Is it?

POPPY
Well, yeah - it means we’re aware.

ZOE
Well, I’m aware smoking’s bad for me -—
doesn’t mean I’m going to stop.

POPPY
Well, as long as you know what’s going
to kill you!

ZOE
Oh yeah - thanks!

POPPY
That’s alright - any time!

TASH
I know drinking’s bad for me, but you
know... (West Indian accent) I can't
help myself!! (She takes a swig.)

ZOE
Oh, shame! (She lights a cigarette.)

POPPY
Cheers!
25.

ZOE
Cheers, everyone! Here’s to our
livers, and all who drown in them.
Careful, Poppy - you’ve got your first
driving lesson tomorrow!

TASH
Oh, boy!

POPPY
Oh, yeah - quick put that down!! (She
puts down her drink.)

TASH
You don’t want to mess up your blind
spot, Poppy!

POPPY
Oh, wow! That sounds good. (She covers
her eyes.) Oh, it’s here. (ZOE holds
up two fingers behind POPPY's head.)
How many fingers?

(They all laugh.)

The next day. POPPY and ZOE’s hall. The doorbell rings.
ZOE comes out of the kitchen, holding a mug and a
cigarette. POPPY rushes down the stairs.

ZOE
That must be for you.

POPPY
(Sings)
I’m so excited!

ZOE
Yeah, I think you should do some deep
breathing, before you get in the car.
(POPPY does mock deep breathing, and
looks out of the window.)

POPPY
Ooh! Can't see him. (Going.) Wish me
luck!!

ZOE

Good luck! I’1l keep the Emergency
Services on stand-by.

POPPY
(Off)
Any excuse, eh? I know what you’re
like with firemen!
26.

In the street. POPPY comes out of the flat.

POPPY
Hello. Scott?

(SCOTT is a severe-looking chap with a goatee beard and
an earring.)

ScoTT
Are you Poppy?

POPPY
That’s me! Nice to meet you.

(She holds out her hand, but SCOTT walks away.)

SCOTT
Right, the car’s just here.

POPPY
(cheerful)
They're not infected! What’re you
like? (SCOTT gets into his car.)
They're clean. I just washed them,
specially. Honest! This it, then?

sScoTtT
Will you get in the passenger seat?
POPPY
You know it’s me that’s learning to
drive?
ScoTT

Yeah. But we’ve got to talk a few
things through first.

POPPY
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you
insist! (She goes round the car, and
gets in.) Did you choose this colour
car, Scott?

ScoTT
Right, make yourself comfortable.

POPPY
Thank you. This your car?

ScoTT
No, it’s the company’s car.

POPPY
Oh, right. What’s your car like, then?
27.

ScoTT
It is my car.

POPPY
Thought you just said it was the
company’s car! Make your mind up!
(Giggles. )

ScoTT
Have you got your Provisional Driving
Licence?

POPPY
Yep. (She hands it over.) There you
go. (He looks at it.) That’s me ona
bad day.

ScoTT

Is that your real name - Pauline?
POPPY

That’s right.
sScoTtT

Okay, everything seems to be in order.

POPPY
Does it? That’s good. (She puts away
the Licence.)

ScoTT
Now: have you ever had a driving
lesson before?

POPPY
Yeah. No. It wasn’t really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac. In Miami. Bunny-
hop, down the beach. I was a bit
pissed. It was hilarious! (She
laughs.)

ScoTT
Well, we’re not going to be pissed
when we're driving this car.

POPPY
No.

ScoTT
Okay? We're not going to bunny-hop.
We’re going to focus, and concentrate.

Now I’m going to take you to a spot
where we take all the learner drivers.

POPPY
Are you, now?
28.

ScoTT
And we're going to go through what we
call the Cockpit Drill.

POPPY
Oh! Naughty!

sScoTT
So: you're going to listen, and take
responsibility.

POPPY

See what I can do.

ScoTT
Okay. Put your seat-belt on.

POPPY
Will do, Captain Scott. (They put on
their belts.) Here we go, gigolo!

A few minutes later. They are driving through Victorian
suburban streets.

ScoTT
So you spoke to the office.

POPPY
That's right - spoke to your boss.

ScoTT
He’s not my boss. I work for myself,
I’m my own man.

POPPY
But it’s his car...? It’s your car...?
Someone’s...! (She laughs)

ScoTT

And they told you the price? Twenty-
two pounds fifty an hour.

POPPY
Yeah, that’s right. Cheap as chips you
lot, aren’t you?

ScoTT

We may be cheap, but we’re better.
POPPY

Are you?
ScoTT

You wanna go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.
29.

POPPY
They don’t!

ScoTT
They've just passed their test, and
they charge more.

POPPY
Bastards!

ScoTT
Us experienced instructors, we go with
the small companies, and we charge
less.

POPPY
That makes a lot of sense, that does.

ScoTT
Cheapness is relative.

POPPY
Yeah, it is - you’re right! Bang on!
(She laughs.)

ScoTT
So d’you want the same time every
week?

POPPY
Go on, then!

ScoTT
Well, do you or don’t you? I need to
know.

POPPY
Well, if you need to know....If it’s
good for you, it’s good for me, Scott.

ScoTT
Okay. Twelve o’clock, every Saturday.
POPPY
Do you like working Saturdays?
ScoTT
I only work half day, Saturday.
POPPY
That’s good.
ScoTT

You’re my last pupil.

POPPY
What d’you do for the rest of the day?
You going out tonight?
30.

ScoTT
I shall go home, and read my book.
POPPY
Oh! Must be a good book. What is it?
(Pause. )
ScoTT
It’s a book.
POPPY

Yeah, well - we worked that much out.

(She decides to leave it at that. They drive along.)

A few minutes later. The car is stationary. They have
changed places - POPPY is now at the wheel. (POPPY
finds much of this scene hilarious, and giggles and
laughs throughout.)

ScoTT
Okay, you see three pedals in front of
you.

POPPY
Yeah. Yep.

ScoTT

Will you please put your foot on the
left-hand pedal, and push it all the
way down?

(She does so.)

POPPY
Ooh! He’s a bit frisky, isn’t he?

ScoTT
Okay, Pauline, please take your boot
off the pedal.

POPPY
(Laughing)
Nobody's called me Pauline since I was
two years old. Makes me laugh!

ScoTT
Well, what am I supposed to call you?

POPPY
Oh, how about...Poppy?

ScoTT
Poppy?
31.

POPPY
Yeah.

ScoTT
Oh, yeah.

POPPY

No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I
don’t mind.

ScoTT
Okay, Poppy. Your boots are
inappropriate for a driving lesson.

POPPY
Why? What’s wrong with them?

ScoTT
You can’t control a car in high heels.

POPPY
Oh, no - I can do a lot of things in
these. You should see me in these
babies on a dance floor!

ScoTT
Well, they may be good on a dance
floor -

POPPY

No, they’re not just a good on a dance
floor, they are - ooh!

ScoTT
They may be good, in a pink Cadillac,
on a beach, when you’re pissed with
your boyfriend, but they’re not
suitable for driving.

POPPY
You’re funny!

ScoTT
Now, next week, I want you to bring
flat-soled shoes.

POPPY
I don’t look any good in them.

ScoTT
I don’t care how you look - it’s how
you drive.

POPPY
Alright - I'll see what I can rustle
up for you, Scott. Leave it to me.
32.

ScoTT
Good. Right. You see three mirrors -—
your two side-view mirrors and your
rear-view mirror.

POPPY
Yeah.

ScoTT
They make a Golden Triangle.

POPPY
Oh, is that like the pubic triangle?

ScoTT
It's the pyramid, and at the top of
the pyramid, you see the all-seeing
eye, Enrahah. Can you repeat that,
please? En-ra-hah.

POPPY
Are you talking about the Eye of
Lucifer?

ScoTT
No.

POPPY

Because I don’t know if I want to look
in there, thank you very much!

ScoTT
It’s not Lucifer. There are two fallen
angels before Lucifer. There is
Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.

POPPY
I’m sorry, I don’t have them in my
phone-book.

ScoTT
Well, bear with me.
POPPY
Is there? Where is he?
ScoTT
Bear with me.
POPPY

I can’t see him.

ScoTT
It's a teaching tool.

POPPY
Oh, is it?
33.

ScoTT
Let me explain something to you about
teaching, Poppy.

POPPY
Go on, then.

ScoTT

The teacher’s job is to bring out good
habits in the pupil, and to get rid of
bad habits. He does that through
frequent, repetitive thinking, and he
does that by creating clear and
distinct images that are easy for the
pupil to retain.

POPPY
Oh! Does he, now?

ScoTT
Yes.

POPPY

Don’t worry - it’s buried in there!
It’s buried in there!

ScoTT
You see. You remember. You will
remember Enrahah till the day you die,
and I will have done my job.

POPPY
Why don’t you have something nice up
there, like a giant strawberry, or
something?

ScoTT
Because it works. Believe you me, it
works. Okay - stop!!!

POPPY
Oh! What? What am I doing now?

ScoTT
Please take you hand off the gear. Off
the gear-stick.

POPPY
(Doing so)
Alright, alright!

ScoTT
Please take your foot off the pedal.

POPPY
Alright - I’m not touching anything!
34.

ScoTT
Let me explain to you something,
Poppy.

POPPY
Yeah?

ScoTtT

This car is my livelihood. This car is
how I earn my living - I mean, I don't
know how you earn you living, right?

POPPY
Yeah...

ScoTtT
But if I walked into your pub or your
discotheque or your club, and I walked
up to the DJ, and I scratched all his
records, or I smash all the glasses,
and I said, ‘I’m sorry, I didn’t know
what I was doing’, that wouldn’t be
acceptable, would it?

POPPY
Well, there’s only one problem with
that. I don’t own a bar or a disco.
I’m just a primary school teacher.

ScoTT
Are you?

POPPY
‘Fraid so, kiddo! Are you a Satanist,
Scott?

ScoTT
No. In fact, I’m exactly the opposite.
POPPY
Are you the Pope, then?
sScoTtT
It's the same thing.
POPPY
Is it. Does he know that?
ScoTT
Right. You have three pedals - A, B, C-
POPPY
Yes...
ScoTT

Accelerator, brake and clutch.
35.

POPPY
(Singing)
“A.B.C. Talking about -” Lovely.
ScoTT
Good.
POPPY
Lovely.

That afternoon. POPPY and ZOE are walking briskly
through a busy market, carrying shopping.

ZOE
So what was he like?
POPPY
Oh, you'd love him.
ZOE
Would I?
POPPY
He made me laugh. He’s funny.
ZOE
What, like funny ha-ha, or funny
peculiar?
POPPY
Bit of both, actually.
ZOE
So what happened then?
POPPY
He shouted at me.
ZOE
What, he gave you a telling-off?
POPPY
He’s a little bit uptight. Just a
little bit.
ZOE

Bet you wound him up.

POPPY
Said I'd set you up with him.

ZOE
Is he fit?
36.

POPPY
Yeah. No he’s not fit at all. Just
your type.

(As they pass the steps to an upper shopping level,
SUZIE comes down with a BOYFRIEND. They are having a
fierce row.)

SUZIE
That's what you can get out of it.
What do I get out of it?

BOYFRIEND
You can get a shag whenever you want.
SUZIE
Oh yeah? When was the last time that
happened?
BOYFRIEND

Well, whose fault is that, eh? (She
walks off.) Where are you going?
Suzie!!

(POPPY and ZOE, having noticed them, have stopped to
wait. SUZIE sees them.)

SUZIE
You alright?

POPPY
Alright?

ZOE
Hi, Suzie.

POPPY

What’s going on?
(SUZIE keeps walking.)

SUZIE
(to POPPY and ZOE)
Come on!

POPPY
(To the BOYFRIEND)
Shouting at my little sister?

BOYFRIEND
No!

POPPY
Doesn't look like it, does it?

SUZIE
Poppy!
37.

BOYFRIEND
(To SUZIE)
Where are you going?!
SUZIE
Fuck off!!
POPPY

Ooh! You're not coming with us,
apparently. Adios!

(She catches up with SUZIE and ZOE, who have gone on.
The BOYFRIEND watches them go off, then turns on his
heel and scuttles off in another direction.)

POPPY trampolining. We watch her in slow motion. She is
contented and happy.

Next day. A school corridor. POPPY is carrying a globe
of the world.

POPPY
Oh! (She suffers a sudden twinge in
her back. Her head teacher, HEATHER,
comes out of a room, and walks along
with POPPY.)

HEATHER
Morning, Poppy!

POPPY
Alright?

HEATHER
What’s the matter?

POPPY
Buggered my back, haven’t I?

HEATHER
Looks like it.

POPPY
Trampolining.

HEATHER

Trampolining? Really?

POPPY
Yeah, I go every week.

HEATHER
What, after school?
38.

POPPY
I love it!

HEATHER
Great!

POPPY

Well, you’ve got to keep the muscles a-
pumping, haven’t you?

HEATHER

No, cos I’ve just started Flamenco.
POPPY

You haven’t!
HEATHER

It’s fantastic.

POPPY
I’ve always wanted to do that. Bit
o’that. (She does a Flamenco gesture,
but it hurts.)

HEATHER
Careful!
POPPY
I’m alright.
HEATHER
Come along, if you want.
POPPY
When is it?
HEATHER
Every Tuesday. Six-thirty.
POPPY
HEATHER

Well, see how you feel.

POPPY
Alright.

(They part company. POPPY goes off to her classroom. As
HEATHER moves away, she stops for a moment to do a
Flamenco step. A schoolgirl passes her.)

HEATHER
Morning, Leanne.

SCHOOLGIRL
Morning, Mrs Duckworth.
39.

The next day. POPPY and ZOE are walking along a street.
They pass a large, bold mural.

POPPY
Stink of urine round here.
ZOE
I can’t smell anything.
POPPY
You peed your pants again?
ZOE
Yeah - sorry!
POPPY
You’re a naughty girl!
ZOE
Tell me about it.
POPPY
Ow! (A twinge in the back. She stops
still.)
ZOE
You alright?
POPPY
Yeah.
ZOE

Come on - we’re nearly there.

(They set off again.)

POPPY
You lost your sense of smell, or
something?

ZOE

Yeah - smoking dulls your senses.

POPPY
And your brains.

(They arrive at a Physiotherapy Centre.)

POPPY (CONT'D)
Here we go.

ZOE
Go on, then.

(They go in.)
40.

They are sitting in Reception. POPPY is holding a
clipboard. ZOE is reading a magazine. The young woman
RECEPTIONIST comes in.

POPPY
Done that.

RECEPTIONIST
All done?

POPPY

Yeah, thanks. (She gives her the
clipboard. )

RECEPTIONIST
Okay.

(A very large osteopath arrives, speaking to a leaving
patient.)

OSTEOPATH
Take care. (He comes into the
Reception room.) Okay, who have we got

next?
RECEPTIONIST
Poppy Cross.
OSTEOPATH
(to Zoe)
Poppy?
ZOE

No, I’m Zoe. Nice to meet you. (She
shakes his hand.)

POPPY
(Getting up)
No, I’m Poppy. (She shakes his hand.)
Don’t know who she is.

ZOE
I’m her friend.

OSTEOPATH
My name’s Ezra.

POPPY
Hello, Ezra.

EZRA

Would you just follow me upstairs?

(She does so.)
4l.

POPPY
You're big, aren’t you?
ZOE
Good luck!
EZRA

Just take your time.

POPPY
What’re you going to do to me? (A
twinge as she ascends the stairs.) Oh!
Makes me laugh!

In EZRA’s consulting room. POPPY is wearing her bra,
pants and tights. She is standing. EZRA stands behind
her. POPPY remains jolly throughout the following.

EZRA
Okay, I’m just going to feel the
muscles in your back...

POPPY
Alright.

EZRA
And you let me know where the pain is.

POPPY
Send you a text. (He works his way
down her back.) Strong fingers. It

tickles! Oh! - Bang on the money!
EZRA

Okay... (continuing)
POPPY

ow!
EZRA

And this side?

POPPY
Yeah! (She laughs.)

EZRA
Okay, d’you want to just reach down to
your side, as if you were picking
something up?

POPPY
Pickin’ chickens. (She leans to one
side.) No, sorry - I can’t do that!
Ow! Oo - hoo!
42.

Down in Reception, ZOE is still reading a magazine. She
glances at a sweating, overweight MAN, who has arrived
since POPPY went upstairs. He is holding his back, and
is clearly in pain.

ZOE
Is it your back?

MAN
Sorry?

ZOE
Cos it can affect everything, can’t
it?

(The MAN says nothing. He isn't happy. The RECEPTIONIST
looks at ZOE for a moment.)

ZOE
Like your mood, and everything.

Back upstairs, POPPY is sitting on the examination
table, which EZRA is raising with a foot-pedal.

POPPY
Nice action.

EZRA
Lie on your back for me, please.

POPPY
Get one of these. Come in very handy.
(She lies down.) Oh! Ow!

EZRA
Okay, I’m just going to ask you to
roll yourself onto your side, facing
me.

POPPY
You don’t ask for much, do you, eh?

EZRA
I’m just going to feel the muscles in
your spine again. (He does so.)

POPPY
Oh...Ow! What-d’you-m’call-it? Ding-
dang-dilly-dilly-dadah, hoo-hoo!

EZRA
Okay. Alright. Lie back.
43.

POPPY
(doing so)
Oh. Here we go.

EZRA
There’s a joint in your spine that’s
jammed up.
POPPY
Oh, no!
EZRA
Would you like me to release it for
you?
POPPY
Is it serious?
EZRA
No, it’s not too bad.
POPPY
What’re you gonna do? Will it hurt?
EZRA
(laughing)

It may, for a few days.

(POPPY considers for a moment.)

POPPY
Go on, then - go for your life!
EZRA
Are you sure?
POPPY
Aw...If you're quick! (She covers her
eyes.)
EZRA
Okay.

A few moments later, EZRA has hold of POPPY’s body with
both hands.

EZRA
I’m going roll you over, and you’re
going to feel a short, sharp click in
your back. Okay! Breathe in, and...

POPPY
Oh, wait a minute! (She laughs)
44,

EZRA
Okay. Are you ready?

POPPY
Yeah.

EZRA

Okay. Breathe in. (She does so.) And
release! (We hear the click.)

POPPY

Oh! Koochickara! (She laughs.)
EZRA

Okay. Just relax for me.
POPPY

I didn't know you were going to do

that.
(EZRA lowers the examination table.)

EZRA
Just relax, and breathe normally.

POPPY
Hey! (She relaxes.) Ah!

EZRA
Okay - d’you want to sit up for me?

POPPY
Yeah. (She does so.)

In SCOTT’s car. Victorian tree-lined streets again.
scoTT is driving.

ScoTT
Is this going to be a regular
occurrence, chopping and changing?

POPPY
Sorry, Scott. Something came up.

ScoTT
Well, I’ve got a life too, you know.

POPPY
I had to make an appointment.

ScoTT
Isn’t this an appointment?

POPPY
I couldn’t help it.
45.

sScoTtT
The road to Hell is paved with good
intentions.

POPPY
Sounds like fun. Having a bad day, are
you?

sScoTtT
I had a bad pupil this morning.

POPPY
Oh, no - what’d he do?

ScoTT
He was late, he refused to pay his
money, he slammed the door, and he
swore at me.

POPPY
You shout at him, did you?

ScoTT
I drove off. I’m not teaching him
again.

POPPY
You show him.

ScoTT
He’s rude, he’s arrogant, he’s over-
confident, and he’s too ‘street’.

POPPY
You don’t like that, do you?

ScoTT
He’s been over-indulged, and
encouraged to express himself.

POPPY
Express himself? Quick! Chop his hands
off!

ScoTT
You know what it means, when they
express themselves?

POPPY
Go on.

ScoTT
How little do they know. How little do
their mothers know. (POPPY laughs.)
And they smell.

POPPY
It's not easy being you, is it, eh?
46.

They have pulled up. POPPY and SCOTT get out and change
places, passing each other on the way.

POPPY
Fancy meeting you ‘ere! (She laughs)
You don’t have to laugh - I’1l let you
off!

(They get into the car.)

Moments later. The car inches slowly out into the
centre of the road.

ScoTT
Okay - gently, gently, gently, gently,
gently - steady progression -

POPPY
Sorry...

ScoTT
Okay, take your foot off the brake -
there’s no need to put your foot on

the brake.

POPPY
Alright.

ScoTT
D’you know what’s doing that?

POPPY
What is doing it?

ScoTT
Your boots.

POPPY
My feet.

sScoTtT

Your boots are doing that.

POPPY
No, I was just taking my feet -

ScoTT
Your boots - no, Poppy -

POPPY
I panicked.
47.

ScoTT
Your boots - they’re inappropriate
boots. Okay - on.

(They drive on. Much of the following dialogue
overlaps.)

ScoTT
Poppy! Come on, let’s pick up some
speed, okay?

POPPY
Alright, alright! Don't shout at me,
Scott, please! I’m just learning.

sScoTtT
Well, don’t dilly-dally, let’s just go
- okay? We’re going to do a next -

POPPY
I’m just learning.

ScoTT
Left-hand turn. Okay?

POPPY
Panic me.

sScoTT

So: mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

POPPY
Gets me right there.

ScoTT
Enrahah! Enrahah - both hands on the
wheel. Enrahah. Enrahah.

POPPY
Don’t like that. Gives me the creeps!
sScoTtT
Okay, Poppy. Indicate. Mirror, signal,
manoeuvre.
POPPY
Indicate...(She indicates.)
ScoTT
Signal! Okay...
POPPY

How am I doing?
48.

ScoTT
Put down the brake - put down the
clutch, or you’re gonna stall...

(The car stops.)

POPPY
Oh!

ScoTT
Okay - find your biting-point, and
peep and creep.

POPPY
There you go.

ScoTT
Put it in first gear.

POPPY
First gear.

ScoTT
Peep and creep; peep and creep.

POPPY
Peepin’ and a-creepin’...

(The car moves slowly off.)
Minutes later...

ScoTT
So...when you get to the end of the
road, we're gonna turn right.

(A young man crosses the road.)

POPPY
Oh, he’s nice!

ScoTT
When we get to the end of the road,
we’re gonna turn - can you please
focus on the driving? Okay: enrahah;
enrahah, enrahah, enrahah...

POPPY
Yeah, that’s a bit weird...

ScoTT
Okay. Put your foot on the brake, put
down the clutch, you don’t want to
stall. Find your bite - okay: can you
feel you’re slightly on a hill?

POPPY
No.
49,

ScoTT
Okay. Put the hand-brake on; find your
biting point...

(Two black guys cycle past the car.)

ScoTT
Okay - lock your door, lock your door!

POPPY
Don’t be ridiculous!

ScoTT
Poppy - there’s two of them.

POPPY
Are you taking the piss?

ScoTT
Lock your door!

POPPY
Are you taking the piss?

ScoTT
On you go, okay - let’s go! Let’s go,
Poppy! Let’s go!

POPPY
I don’t believe you just said that.

ScoTT
Let’s go! On you go.

POPPY
Let’s go that way.

(She means the way the cyclists went.)

ScoTT
(Hysterical)
POPPY!! LET’S GO!!! WE’RE ON A BEND!!!
NOW LET’S GO!!!

POPPY
(Good-humouredly)
Blimey O'Reilly!
50.

Scott
Right! On you go! Keep to the left of
the centre of the road.

(The car drives off.)

Outside POPPY’s flat. The car has pulled up. SCOTT is
back in the driver’s seat. POPPY is taking money out of
her bag.

POPPY
Usual time next week? Twelve O’clock?
(SCOTT takes the money.) You can check
it, if you like. See you.

(She gets out of the car. SCOTT pockets the money.
POPPY makes an “I'm watching you!" gesture. SCOTT looks
at her, then drives off. As POPPY is opening her front
door, a man walks past with a dog.)

POPPY
Alright, doggie?

(She goes inside.)

A little later. POPPY is kneeling next to ZOE, who is
sitting in an armchair, holding open a copy of The
Highway Code.

ZOE

Okay. Here’s another one.
POPPY

Yeah.
ZOE

Circle; completely red -

POPPY
What, like a tomato?

ZOE
For instance; white horizontal line.

POPPY
Give us a clue, Zoe.
51.

ZOE
Horizontal. (Demonstrates, with her
arm.) Parallel to the horizon.

POPPY
Thank you, Miss Marsh.

ZOE
You’re welcome.

POPPY
So, it’s not up and down, like a yo-
yo? (She holds her fore-arm vertical.)

ZOE
No.
POPPY
Right.
ZOE
What is it?
POPPY
Vertical.
ZOE
No, you muppet - the sign!
POPPY
That'd be ‘No Entry’, Zoe.
ZOE
For what?
POPPY

For black boys on bicycles.

ZOE
Don’t get me started on that again.

POPPY
It just popped out of his mouth. I
couldn't believe it.

ZOE
You could always get another
instructor.

POPPY

Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh? Ask
me another.

ZOE
This is also a red circle.

POPPY
Yep.
(Pause. )

52.

ZOE
Black car - this isn’t a racist thing.
POPPY
I’m glad to hear it.
ZOE
Next to the black car is a red car.
POPPY
That's Mr Golly overtaking Mr Noddy.
ZOE
(Shaking her head.)
Enrahah.
POPPY
Enrahah to you.
ZOE
What is it?
POPPY
No overtaking.
ZOE
Enrahah!
POPPY

Enrahah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah!

ZOE
He sounds like a nutter.

POPPY
He is a nutter.

ZOE
So how’s your back?

POPPY
It's alright, actually. He sorted it.
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn’t
he?

ZOE
He was fit. (POPPY laughs.) Octagonal
sign with “STOP” written on it.

POPPY
“STOP”.

ZOE
Alright, then.
53.

(She closes the book. POPPY laughs. They stare at each
other.)

POPPY
Who’s going to blink first? (They move
closer to each other, until their
noses almost touch.) D’'you want a
cuppa tea?

ZOE
Yes, please.

POPPY and HEATHER rush out of their school. HEATHER is
speaking into her mobile.

HEATHER
No, you have the lasagne tonight - we
can finish the chicken tomorrow,
alright? Look, I can’t talk now. See
you later!

(They have arrived at HEATHER's car. They get in.)

POPPY
Think we’ll make it?

HEATHER
Depends on the traffic.

POPPY
Should be alright.

(They leave at great speed.)

Now they both rush into a large civic hall, where the
Flamenco class is just starting. About twenty-five
adults, mostly women, are spread out, facing the
teacher, who is standing in front of a line of mirrors.

TEACHER
(Spanish accent)
Come in, ladies - quick as you can.
D’you want to put your bags? Then
there’s a couple of places.

HEATHER
Sorry we’re late.

POPPY
Sorry!
54.

TEACHER
No problem - it’s very Spanish to be
late. Just take your places, then we
can start the class. Here! (She points
to a gap, to which HEATHER and POPPY
go.) I was just introducin’ myself to
the peoples what don’t know me. Is
lovely to see you again, and lovely
that you bring a friend. Welcome in my
class.

(She bows. POPPY curtsies back - a sort of comic, mock-
curtsy. She exchanges a smile with a large young woman
next to her.)

TEACHER
So! My name is Rosita Santos, and I’m
comin’ from Seviglia, in Spain. Or
“Seville”, what you say here. What is
famous for our bullfighting (imitates
bull), for our beautiful oranges, what
you English peoples turn into
disgusting marmalade, and also, is the
birth home of FLAMENCO!! (She strikes
a flamenco pose.) So...

(HEATHER has gestured to POPPY that her sun-glasses are
still on her head. So POPPY now runs over to put them
with her bag, which she has left on the other side of
the room. She does a comic mock-unobtrusive sort of a
run. The TEACHER, unamused, waits until POPPY is back
in her place.)

TEACHER

Then everybody is ready? I hope! (She
looks pointedly at POPPY.) So, feet in
parallel. Hip distance apart. Pulling
up from the waist, opening across the
chest; shoulder blades drawing down to
the spine; arms relaxed. And taking
the head over to the right, feeling
that lovely stretched-up neck.

(During this, POPPY accidentally catches the eye of a
defensive-looking young man just behind her. She is, of
course, quietly amused by this.)
55.

TEACHER
Then to the left.

POPPY
(whispers to HEATHER)
Not very Flamenco, is it?

HEATHER
(gestures)
S-sh.

TEACHER
To the right. Bring the head back to
the centre. And relax. Lovely.

(POPPY does an exaggerated reaction to a twinge in her
neck. )

A few minutes later...

TEACHER
So, guys. We’re going to reverse the
abs now. Thighs to the front. Liftin’
up from the elbows. Like they got
strings attached - like little
Pinocchio. Lifting, lifting. Keeping
the shoulders down. Arms above the
head. Framing the face. “Here I am.”
Proud. Then bringing the arms down in
front. Pressing, pressing, pressing.
Keeping the tension. Keeping the
strength. But fluid, as well. Then
lifting up again, from the elbows.
Like the eagle, spreading his wings.
Beautiful. Angry. Ferocious.

(POPPY acts out the last three attitudes, appropriately
scowling and grimacing with gusto.)

TEACHER
And guys...When you're lifting your
eagle wings, remember that this dance
comes from the pain, from the
suffering of los gitanos, em, what you
say? - the gypsies. I know this word
not politically correct. But these
guys, they’ve been squashed down by
society for centuries, centuries. And
they say, “We don’t need this! We got
pride! We got dignity! We got art! We
got FLAMENCO! !”
56.

(Again she strikes a Flamenco pose. POPPY is quietly
amused. )

TEACHER
They say, “This...my space.” (She
stamps her feet twice.) My space!
(Stamps.) My space. (Stamps) My space!
(Stamps.) Everybody do this! One, two!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER
And again!

ALL
My space!

(POPPY enters into the spirit of it. Everybody stamps
their feet.)

TEACHER
Vamos, vamos!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER
And again!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER
Vamos, Vamos!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER
With meaning!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER
But, guys -

ALL
My space!

TEACHER

One more time!

ALL
My space!
57.

TEACHER
With expression!

ALL
My space!

TEACHER

I don’t believe it!
ALL

My space!

Later in the lesson. POPPY is doing her best.

TEACHER
Okay, guys. I give you two counts in,
then we’re going to stamp and clap the
compas, okay?

(The class is arranged in two facing lines. They
advance towards each other, stamping and clapping.
Suddenly the TEACHER breaks through the centre, halting
the proceedings. )

TEACHER
Guys! Guys! Guys! What are you doing?
Joder! Where is the passion? Where is
the revenge? Where is the blood? This
is Flamenco! That clapping, it’s so
polite. It’s like the end of the
opera. “Excuse me. How many sugar you
want in your tea?”

(The LARGE YOUNG WOMAN laughs. The TEACHER points to
her, and addresses HEATHER. )

TEACHER
This woman has been spending every
Wednesday afternoon for a year, with
your husband in a hotel in Paddington.

(She points to a man, and addresses another girl.)

TEACHER
This guy has been having an affair for
five years with your best friend!
58.

Your boyfriend, what you give your
love, your spirit, for five years,
betrays you with a Swedish bitch what
is twenty-two years old. You want to
cut off his balls!

(She is distraught, and covers her eyes.)

TEACHER
He’s such a bastard! I hate him!

POPPY

(quietly)
Are you alright?

(The TEACHER runs out of the hall. The door slams. The
class is stunned.)

In a pub. POPPY and HEATHER, at a table, are sipping
white wine.

POPPY
Didn't bargain for that. That was
something else wasn’t it?

HEATHER
I know. But all credit to her, though.
She picked herself up, she came
straight back into the class.

POPPY
As if nothing had happened. Like a
little fireball, wasn’t she?

HEATHER
Not a grain of sentimentality.

POPPY
No! Wipe the tears! Bless her - I just
wanted to give her a hug.

HEATHER
I don’t think she’d have quite
appreciated that.

POPPY
No. (The TEACHER's voice) “This is my
space - get off me!!” Does leave a

nasty taste, though, doesn’t it?
Exploding her heart all over the
floor.

HEATHER
Then it was, “put that away.”
59.

POPPY
“Stick that back in the box.”

HEATHER
“Get it out another time.”

POPPY
Perhaps never!

HEATHER
You’1l be lucky!

POPPY
Yeah, I know. She must be going
through some shit, though, mustn’t
she?

HEATHER
She’s actually a good teacher.

POPPY
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

HEATHER
She’s just going to burn herself out.

POPPY
I believed her when she said she’d cut
off his balls, though. Didn’t you?

HEATHER
I don’t expect the guys’1l be back
next week, then.

POPPY
No. Snip! Snip!

(She mimes big scissors. They laugh.)

HEATHER
How’s your love-life?

POPPY
How is my love-life?

HEATHER
Nothing doing?

POPPY
Not a sausage.

HEATHER
You okay with that?

POPPY
Oh, yeah!
60.

HEATHER
Good for you!

POPPY
Cheers!

HEATHER
Cheers!

(They drink their wine.)

POPPY
How’s your Beth?

HEATHER
Darren’s dumped her.

POPPY
Oh, no!

HEATHER

Just before her eighteenth birthday.
Thanks, Darren!

POPPY

Why do men always do that, eh?
HEATHER

I know.
POPPY

Christmas, Valentine’s Day - Voom!
They’re gone!

HEATHER
I’m just hoping he’s not going to turn
up to the party.

POPPY
Name off the list!

HEATHER
I’m looking at her, and I’m thinking,
“Don’t call him. Don’t call him!”

POPPY
Don’t do it Beth! Don’t do it!

HEATHER
You can’t say anything, though. You've
just got to let’em get on with it.

POPPY
You can’t help being protective,
though, can you? Course, she’s got her
A-Levels coming up, hasn’t she?
61.

HEATHER
Fingers crossed, she’s going to
Manchester.

POPPY

Fantastic. What does she want to do up
there?

HEATHER
Sociology.

POPPY
Lovely.

HEATHER

I’m hoping she’s going to take a gap
year. Travel.

POPPY
That’s important. Get out there - see
the world!

HEATHER
Yeah, I think so. Cos I never got the
chance.

POPPY
Nor me.
HEATHER
You made up for it later, though.
POPPY
Did I, just!
HEATHER

Where were you?

POPPY
All over the place. Taught in a school
in Thailand. For six months. Me and
Zoe. Started off in Australia. Zoe’s
got relations in Melbourne - and
Sydney. Bali. Java. Malaysia. Vietnam -
beautiful. Then Thailand.

HEATHER
Fabulous!

POPPY
Amazing. Gorgeous kids. Loved
learning. Sixty in a class.

HEATHER
Sixty?!

POPPY
Oh, yeah!
62.

HEATHER
Fantastic! Great challenge!
POPPY
And for them!
HEATHER

Especially for them!

(They both laugh.)

POPPY
D’you want another one?

HEATHER
I'd love to. But I’m driving, aren’t
I?

POPPY
Course you are. Got to be good. Work
tomorrow.

POPPY’s school sits in the London landscape. It’s
playtime.

In her empty classroom, POPPY is tidying books. She
glances out of the window. Children are playing. She
notices two boys in particular. One looks as though he
is bullying the other. She observes them for a moment.

Another driving lesson. POPPY is at the wheel.

Scott
Okay, Poppy. This is your third
driving lesson.

POPPY

Oh, I’m getting quite good, aren’t I?
Scott

No, you’re not good. You’re smug.
POPPY

ow!
Scott

You’re too easily distracted. You're
distracted by squirrels, by dogs, by
children in the park, by old ladies in
surgical stockings -

POPPY
Oh, but bless her!
63.

ScoTT
By half-naked men in their gardens.
POPPY
Oh, well; he was quite fit, wasn’t he,
eh?
ScoTT

No, he wasn’t fit - he had a paunch.

POPPY
Oh, I didn’t know you were checking
him out so carefully, Scott!

ScoTT
Poppy, all you have to do is, keep
your eyes focussed on the road. This
car is a lethal weapon. If you don't
pay attention, you're going to kill
somebody. Keep to the left of the
centre of the road.

POPPY
Oh, but come on, Scott! How often
d’you see a squirrel sending a text

like that?

ScoTT
Left turn. Mirror, signal - Enrahah!
Enrahah!

(POPPY mimes a squirrel sending a text - waggling its
little thumbs. For a split second, she has taken both
hands off the steering wheel.)

ScoTT
Enrahah!! I can’t believe you’re a
teacher. I can’t believe they’ve put
you in charge of forty children.

POPPY
I know. I took me by surprise to be
honest. It’s thirty.

ScoTT
Thirty. You have no respect for order,
you are arrogant, you’re destructive
and you...you celebrate chaos.

POPPY
I slipped through the net, didn’t I?

ScoTT
No, you are the net. Believe you me,
Poppy, you are the net.
64.

Okay, we're going to do the next left
turn. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.
Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy. Okay.
Get away from the bend. Get away from
the bend. Get away from the bend.
D’you remember the pyramid?

POPPY
Don’t remind me!
ScoTT
D’you remember the shape of the
pyramid?
POPPY
Enrahah?
ScoTT

No. Enrahah is the eye at the top of
the pyramid. I’m talking about the
bottom of the pyramid.

POPPY
Are you?

ScoTT
Those at the bottom of the pyramid in
this world are kept in total ignorance
of what those at the top of the
pyramid are achieving. Enrahah.
Enrahah.

POPPY
Where are you on the pyramid?

ScoTT
Me, I’m outside the pyramid, and I’m
looking in.

POPPY
Ah - course you are!

ScoTT
But where are you? Where are you? That
is more to the point? Where are you,
and where are the children?

POPPY
That is the question - where are we
all, eh?

ScoTT
Okay, we're going to do the next left
turn - Enrahah.

POPPY
Did you like school, Scott?
65.

ScoTT
I’m afraid it didn’t agree with me.

POPPY
Oh, that’s a shame.

ScoTT
Now, let me tell you something about
the education system, Poppy.

POPPY
Oh, go on, then.

ScoTT
The education system produces left-
brain prisoners. D’you know what that
means?

POPPY
I do, actually.

ScoTT
No, well I’1l tell you. (POPPY
smiles.) The left brain - our brain
has two sides, the left brain, and the
right brain. The left brain - keep
going! Keep going!

POPPY
I’m going!

sScoTtT
The left brain...is information: data.
It's dead. The right brain is
individuality. It’s where the soul
lies. And the education system, it
works like this: “I will give you a
world view.”

POPPY
Right.

ScoTT
“And if you repeat my world view, if
you reconfirm my world view, you will
pass your exams, and you will go
higher and higher and higher, and you
will become a policeman, a magistrate,
a lawyer, a general, a politician, and
you will be happy and you will
succeed, but if you think for
yourself, if you think outside the
box, then you will be unhappy and you
will fail.” That’s how the education
system works - left turn. Enrahah -
signal. Enrahah.
66.

POPPY
Were you bullied at school, Scott?
Scott
You’re going to do the next left turn.
Enrahah!
POPPY
Kids - they can be cruel, can’t they,
eh?

At school. POPPY rushes out of the classroom, into the
playground.

POPPY
Nick!

(The same two kids. NICK is on top of the other kid,
thumping him. POPPY runs over them.)

POPPY
Nick! Nick! (She pulls NICK off.)
What’s going on? Eh? Are you alright,
Charlie? (CHARLIE sits up.) Now what’s
going on?

Another Flamenco lesson. The class is successfully
performing a flamenco stop in unison, moving across the
hall. The TEACHER is clapping the rhythm, and shouting
encouraging instructions (”"Venga! Venga!” And counting,
“an, dos, tres...”) POPPY is enjoying herself. She is
wearing her boots and a long, coloured frock. They all
come to a standstill.)

TEACHER
Bravo, everybody! I have to tell you,
I am slightly impressed. Much better
than last week - though of course,
this is not difficult! And still could
improve! But...it will do. For now.

POPPY’s classroom. The children are all working. Some
are drawing. Most are writing in their books. POPPY
sits at one of the tables with a group. NICK is
punching another kid - not CHARLIE, this time. POPPY
looks over and sees. She gets up.
67.

POPPY
(to her table)
You carry on with your work. Carry on.
You draw a picture now.

(She joins NICK and the other kid.)

POPPY
Hold on - what’s going on here? D’you
want to stop that, please?

OTHER KID
He’s hurting me.

POPPY
(to NICK)

Are you hurting Ayotunde? (NICK nods.)
Are you alright? Did he hurt you hard?
Did he hit you? (to NICK) Come here.
We do not hurt our friends. (She gets
up.) You come and sit over here. (To
other kids.) You get on with your
work. (She leads NICK across the
room.) Are you hurting Ayotunde? For
no reason - that’s not very nice. It’s
not what we do our friends. (To
another kid.) Yes, you can. You can
get on with that. (A girl speaks to
POPPY) Okay, Chelsea. (To NICK) What's
happening here? Eh?

(POPPY has settled NICK at her table.)

A little later. The classroom is now empty. NICK is in
the same seat. POPPY is sitting on the table beside
him.

POPPY
You can talk to me...you know.
Anything you want to say. I’m here to
help you. Cos I’m your mate, aren’t I?

NICK
Yes.

POPPY
Yeah. That’s right. That’s what mates
do. Isn’t it?

NICK
Yes.
68.

POPPY
Yeah. (NICK rubs his face.) What's
making you so angry? I’m going to help
sort this out.

In a school corridor. POPPY bustles by some kids who
are dawdling out of the main entrance.

POPPY
Come on! Chop-chop!

(She proceeds along the corridor. A woman comes out of
a room. POPPY greets her, then knocks on HEATHER's
door. HEATHER is typing.)

HEATHER
Poppy!

POPPY
Got a minute?

HEATHER
What’s up?

POPPY

We might have a problem?

HEATHER
(Getting up)
Come in. Sit yourself down.

(POPPY sits. HEATHER closes the door, and joins her.
They speak. We observe them for a few moments through
the glazed door.)

Later that afternoon. POPPY walks slowly through an
attractive park. Nobody is around. POPPY is in a
reflective mood. She stops for a while for a think.

Now it’s dark. POPPY is in a bleak, empty inner city
street. A few parked cars. Somebody walks by in the
distance. A male voice can be heard somewhere, uttering
a strange, indistinguishable chant. As POPPY proceeds,
the voice becomes louder. She looks round. Then she
stops. Slowly, she walks towards where the sound is
coming from.

Where is she? It’s an urban, maybe industrial place of
some kind, but it’s quite impossible to recognise.
Steel girders and burning electric lights stretch into
the darkness.
69.

Suddenly, POPPY comes across the chanting man. He is
bearded, unkempt, dirty. Let’s call him a TRAMP. He
sits alone, chanting. Then he sees POPPY, and stops
singing abruptly. He speaks with an Irish accent.

TRAMP
D’you know what I mean? You know? You
know? D’you know?

POPPY
I know!

TRAMP
It’s -, it’s -, it’s -, it’s -, it’s,
it’s -, it’s -,

POPPY

Isn’t it, just? (She moves slowly
nearer him.)

TRAMP
You know? You know, it’s...you know,
they, they, they, they, they -

POPPY
Do they?

TRAMP
They’re not, they’re not, they’re not -
they’re not; they’re not. D’you know?

POPPY
No. (Pause. POPPY sits facing him, on
a kind of ledge.) Are you warm enough?

TRAMP
(Sings, Sinatra)
“I know I said that I was leaving!”

POPPY
That’s nice.
TRAMP
He’s, he’s, he’s -
POPPY
Is he?
TRAMP
You know? He’s....And, and, and, he’s,

he’s, he’s - d’you know, he’s -

POPPY
Oh, no!
70.

TRAMP
He's, he’s, he’s...

POPPY
Oh, no!

TRAMP
He's, he’s, he’s...

POPPY
What is he?

TRAMP
He’s a prick!

POPPY

(laughing)

Oh! I know a few!

(He gets up suddenly, and launches into a vigorous
round of shadow boxing. )

POPPY
There you go! Steady!

TRAMP
(Shouting)
D’YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? - YOU KNOW?!!

POPPY
Yeah, yeah!

(He moves back towards POPPY.)

TRAMP
She’s, she’s, she’s, she’s, she’s,
she’s, she’s - you know, she’s, she’s,
she’s - you know, she’s, she’s, she’s,
she’s, she’s, she’s, you know, she’s,

she’s - she was, she was, she was
SO...

POPPY
Was she?

TRAMP

She wouldn’t, you know - she wouldn't,
she wouldn’t, you know, she wouldn’t -
I’m, I’m, I’m, you know, I’m, I’m, I’m
not, you know - I’m not, you know,
I’m, I’m, I’m...he...he...he...he, you
know, he ...but you know, they’re,
they’re, you know, they’re,
they’re...you know what I mean?
71.

POPPY
Yeah. I do.

(They are now standing very close to each other. POPPY

looks into his face. She is sympathetic and unafraid.)

What’s your name? Eh?

(He looks at her. Then - _

TRAMP
Come on! (He scuttles off.)
POPPY
Where are you going?
TRAMP
Taxi!
POPPY

Oh! That’1ll be for me!
(He stops and turns to her.)

TRAMP
Come on! ‘Sake!

(He walks off. POPPY follows him.)

POPPY
Keep your hair on! I’ve only just met
you. My mum warned me about going with
strangers. (She catches him up.) Where
are you going?

TRAMP
Longest way out, shortest way home!

POPPY
Sod’s Law!

(He mutters something to her, and seems to push her
against a wall, or something.)

POPPY
Alright! What? Ease up!

(He puts his finger to his lips.)

TRAMP
S-sh...
72.

POPPY
What? (He whispers in her ear.) You
what?

TRAMP

(audible whisper)
Is he gone?

POPPY
Is who gone?

TRAMP
(audible whisper)
The rubber knocker man.

POPPY
You what?

TRAMP

(louder)

The rubber knocker man.

POPPY
Oh! The rubber knocker man! Why didn’t
you say?

TRAMP

Ssh - is he gone?

POPPY
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - no, he’s
gone, he’s gone. (She points
somewhere.) I see him - he’s a-
runnin’. He’s a-rubbin’ ‘is knockers!

(But the TRAMP has scuttled off.)

POPPY
Oh! He’s gone! Hang about.

(She starts to follow him. But he is going to urinate
in a corner. POPPY stops.)

POPPY
Oh. There you go! (She turns away.)
Found the en suite, then? Shake it all
about. (She looks around her.) What am
I doing?

(The TRAMP is coming back towards her, wiping his
hands.)
73.

POPPY
All done, then?

(He stops a little distance away, and looks at her in
wonder. )

POPPY
Alright?

(A train passes somewhere not too far away. The TRAMP
walks past POPPY and sits down. She follows him, and
stands near him.)

POPPY
Have you had your dinner?

TRAMP
No.

(POPPY sits next to him. She considers for a moment,
then takes some money from her bag, and proceeds to put
it in his hand.

POPPY
Here. Take that.

TRAMP
No.

POPPY

Something to eat.

TRAMP
No, thank you.

(POPPY puts the money back in her bag.)

POPPY

Where are you going to sleep tonight?
TRAMP

In a bed.
POPPY

Oh?! Course you are! Silly me!

(She laughs. Then he looks at her very intensely.
Pause. )
74.

POPPY
, (sensitively)
What?

(A charged, emotional moment. Then he goes to touch her
face, but POPPY can't help flinching slightly, and he
pulls his hand away. She smiles gently. A moment of
connection. )

TRAMP
You know?

(Pause. She does.)

POPPY
Yeah.

(Then the TRAMP gets up abruptly and scuttles off,
disappearing into the darkness. POPPY watches him for a
moment; then she gets up, puts her bag over her
shoulder, and leaves, stopping to give one last glance
in the TRAMP's direction.)

Now POPPY walks briskly through a very busy night-time
street. Lots of people and traffic. She passes a man
carrying a dog on his shoulders outside a burger bar.

ZOE is on her bed, reading ‘Hideous Kinky’ by Esther
Freud (the Penguin edition, with Kate Winslet on the
cover). POPPY comes in. ZOE looks up.

POPPY
Are you asleep?

ZOE
Yeah.

(POPPY sits on the bed, and leans on ZOE's knees.)

ZOE
So what have you been up to?

POPPY
This ‘n’ that.

ZOE
Ducking and diving.
75.

POPPY
Wheelin’ and a-dealin’.

ZOE
So where you been?

POPPY
Toin’ and a-froin’.

ZOE
Seriously.

POPPY

Seriously. (She takes off her boots.)
I went for a walk.

ZOE
I thought we were going out for a
drink.

POPPY

Oh, yeah. Sorry.

ZOE
Left you a message.

POPPY
My battery died on me.

(POPPY clambers onto the bed, and lies beside ZOE.)

ZOE
So how was your day?

POPPY
How was your day?

ZOE
Fantastic - the earth moved.

POPPY
I’ve got a violent pupil in my flock.

ZOE
What’s he doing?

POPPY
Being violent.

ZOE
What, is he hitting you?

POPPY
He’s hitting the other kids.

ZOE
What’re you doing about it?
76.

POPPY
I spoke to Heather. Poor little
bugger. You’ve got to love ‘em,
haven’t you?

ZOE
Yeah - otherwise you’d kill ‘em. So
where did you go tonight?

POPPY
The eternal question. Where have we
been? Where are we going? What’s the
meaning of life? I went to the moon;
and then back again.

ZOE
Wow, you walk quickly.

POPPY
I’ve got great legs.

ZOE
Yeah, you’ve got great legs. Not that
you’re my type.

(POPPY dives on ZOE's legs and hugs them.)

POPPY
These are great legs!

ZOE
Hey, get off!

(POPPY lies back. ZOE takes hold of POPPY's hand.)

ZOE
Read your palm. (She “reads” it.) I
see a very strong line. It’s your
bullshit line. And I see a tall, dark,

handsome...
POPPY
(enthusiastic noise)
ZOE
..-turd.
POPPY
Oh.
ZOE

And next to it is a bloke.

POPPY
A bloke?
77.

ZOE
Yeah.

POPPY
Let’s see. (ZOE shows her) Oh, yeah -
there he is! Isn’t he gorgeous?

ZOE
Not my type.

POPPY

(Smiling)

No. Where have all the good men gone,
eh?

ZOE
Well, they’re not hiding in here, are
they?

POPPY

Come out! Come out, wherever you are!
We're ready and waiting.

ZOE
They haven't got the balls.

POPPY’s classroom. NICK is alone, reading a book.
HEATHER comes in, followed by POPPY and a tall young
man.

HEATHER
Alright, Nick?

NICK
Yeah.

HEATHER
How are you doing there, then?

NICK
I’m reading.

HEATHER
What are you reading?

NICK
“Yuk!”

HEATHER

“Yuk!"? That’s nice, isn’t it?

POPPY
It’s a classic, that.

(The adults all sit down.)
78.

HEATHER
Nick, this is Tim.

TIM
Hi, Nick.

NICK
Hullo.

HEATHER

Now, Nick, when I asked you the other
day, did you know what a social worker
was, can you remember what you said?

(NICK rubs his eyes.)

NICK
A social worker helps you on...hard
things.

HEATHER

A social worker helps you with hard
things - yes, that’s right -

TIM
That’s true.

POPPY
Very good.

HEATHER

Yeah...That’s right. And I was
thinking, how could I help Tim to get
to know you a bit better, and I was
thinking - cos you’ve been doing some
very good learning this year -

POPPY
Oh, I should say so, yeah...

HEATHER
He has, hasn’t he? And I was thinking,
would you mind showing Tim some of
your work?

NICK
No.

HEATHER
That's a good idea, isn’t it?

POPPY
It is, isn’t it?

TIM
Oh, I’d love to see it.
79.

HEATHER
Is that “no, you don’t want to”, or
“no, you don’t mind”?

NICK
No, I don’t mind.

POPPY
I didn't think you would.

HEATHER
No, you don't mind - well, that’s
good, isn’t it? What’s it going to be?
(She gets up.) Come on, Tim, you come
and sit here.

TIM
Oh - thanks. (He moves.)

(POPPY sifts through a pile of exercise books.)

POPPY
I think you should show off your
maths.

TIM

Let’s have a look - oh, are you good
at maths, Nick?

POPPY
I should cocoa.
HEATHER
(To NICK)
Are you alright, sweet? Are you tired?
POPPY
Let’s have a look at this. Here! Look.
TIM
What’s this, then? Tick, tick, tick,
tick.
HEATHER
Nine out of ten.
POPPY
Yeah.
HEATHER

They're neat, as well, aren’t they?

POPPY
Oh, he’s good at his numbers.

TIM
He’s very good.
80.

POPPY
Yeah, smiley faces.

HEATHER
(to NICK)
Alright, pet. I’m going to see you
later - okay?
(She leaves.)

POPPY
See you.

TIM
Thanks, Mrs Duckworth - see you soon.

(POPPY turns the pages of NICK's book.)

POPPY
Smiley face - big smiley face there.
TIM
Smiley face; ticks, everywhere. Very
good.
POPPY
All last term, this was. Isn't it? Not
bad.
TIM

Is it good this term, as well?

POPPY
Er... (equivocal gesture.) It’s a bit
on and off, innit? Not so good. We’1l
get round that, though.

TIM
Of course. You know you’re not in
trouble, don’t you, Nick?

NICK
Yeah.
POPPY
Yeah.
TIM
Good.
POPPY
No-one could be angry with you. Not
for long.
TIM

You’ve been a bit angry lately,
though, haven't you?
81.

NICK
Yeah.
TIM
What’s made you so angry?
NICK
I don’t know.
TIM
You don’t know? What’s it like at
home?
NICK
Fine.
TIM
Yeah, with you and your mum?
NICK
Yeah.
POPPY
Yeah!
TIM
You get on with your mum, don’t you?
NICK
Yeah.
TIM
Does anybody else come to the house?
NICK
No.
TIM

No? What about any of Mummy’s friends?
Has she got a boyfriend?

NICK
Yeah, she does.
TIM
She does? What’s his name?
NICK
Jason.
TIM

Jason. Is Jason nice?

NICK
No.

(POPPY looks at TIM.)
82.

TIM
Has he been making you angry, Nick?
NICK
Yeah.
POPPY
That’s no good, is it?
TIM
Have you got a piece of paper, Miss
Cross?
POPPY

Yeah. I’m sure we could rustle one up.

(She gets up, and goes to a drawer.)

TIM

Are you good at drawing, Nick?
NICK

Yeah.
TIM

Okay.

(POPPY returns with a piece of paper, and sits down.)

POPPY
Here we go...

TIM
Let’s get you a pencil. (He takes one
from a pot on the desk.) Take that,
Nick. And what I’d like you to do is
draw me a house.

POPPY
D’you think you can do that?
NICK
Yeah.
TIM
Yeah.
POPPY

Yeah. Thought so!

A few minutes later. NICK has drawn a house. He has
drawn a person in each of the two upstairs windows.

TIM
That’s your mum, in her bedroom. Who
else is there?
83.

(NICK draws a third person in the downstairs window. )

NICK
Jason.

TIM
Jason's there. Where’s he?

NICK
He’s...in the living-room.

TIM
In the living-room. You’re all in
different rooms, aren't you?

NICK
Mm-hm.
TIM
Why are you in a different room to
Jason?
NICK
Cos he’s not nice to me.
TIM
He’s not nice - what does he do to
you?
NICK
He hits me.
TIM
He hits you.
NICK
Yeah.
TIM
You know that’s not right, don’t you,
Nick?

(POPPY looks at each of them.)

A little later. POPPY and TIM are at the main door of
the school.

POPPY
Well, it’s lovely to meet you.

TIM
Yeah, you too.

POPPY
Thank you. I think he’s going to be
alright.
84.

TIM
Course he is.
POPPY
Yeah.
TIM
He’s got a good teacher.
POPPY
Has he? Where is she? I can’t see her!
TIM
I’m looking at her.
POPPY
Thank you very much!
TIM
I wouldn’t mind looking at her again,
actually.
POPPY

Oh? I’m sure she wouldn’t mind looking
at you again.

TIM
Really?

POPPY
Yeah.

TIM
That’s good.

POPPY

Give us your number, then.

TIM
Okay. I’1l write it down.

POPPY
That’s a start.

(TIM takes out a notebook, and jots down his number,
which he tears out for POPPY.)

TIM
There you go!

POPPY
Thank you very much!

TIM
You’re welcome.

POPPY
Good bye!
85.

TIM
See you!

(He leaves. She goes back to work.)

Yet another driving lesson. SCOTT is at the wheel.

POPPY

You alright? Had a good week?
ScoTT

Yeah.
POPPY

Oh - that’s a bonus. (She sniffs.)
Smells in here. I didn’t know you had

a dog.

ScoTT
No, it isn't a dog - I’ve just had a
lesson.

POPPY

Oh! Bit stinky, was he?

ScoTT
You could say that. (POPPY laughs.)
You got a dog?

POPPY
No. Live in a flat. Be cruel, wouldn’t
it. I'd love a dog. You ever had a
dog? Your mum and dad got a dog?

ScoTT
My dad’s dead.

POPPY
Oh. Sorry to hear that. How d’you get
on with your mum?

ScoTT
I don’t.

POPPY
Oh.

ScoTT

You live with your mum and dad?

POPPY
No! (She laughs.) How old d’you think
I am? Twelve?

ScoTT
Twenty-two, twenty-three.
86.

POPPY
Oh, I like you - you can stay! I’m
thirty. Old maid now!

ScoTT
So d’you live on your own?

POPPY
No. I live with my flatmate.
Nearly...ten years now. She done well,
bless her.

sScoTtT
It’s a long time.

POPPY
She’s gorgeous. I love her.

ScoTT
What d’you mean, you love her?

POPPY
I mean, I love her, she loves me, we
love each other! (She laughs.)

ScoTT
What, so you - ?

POPPY
What? (Pause. Then she gets it, and
laughs.) Yeah. That’s it! That’s us!
You got a problem with that, Scott?

ScoTT
No. Nothing to do with me.

POPPY
No. I don’t think it is.

A little later. A quiet, leafy street. The car is
stationary. POPPY is at the wheel.

ScoTT
Okay, check your mirrors - Enrahah.

POPPY
Checkin’ chicken!

ScoTT
Okay, indicate and knock on the door -
let them know you want to come in.

POPPY
Ding-dong!
87.

ScoTT
Okay - you put down the clutch, put it
in first gear. Okay find your biting-
point just before you go - okay,

stop!!
POPPY
What?!
ScoTT
Put the car in neutral -
POPPY
What?
ScoTT

Put the car in neutral, put the hand-
brake on, take your hand off the
steering-wheel, your foot off the
pedal, and turn off the ignition key.

POPPY
I haven’t even started yet.

ScoTT
I don’t care. I’ve stopped. Now you
tell me why I’ve stopped.

POPPY
Got a headache?

ScoTT
No - yes, I have got a headache, and
you tell me why I’ve got a headache.

POPPY
Mmm...I dunno - time of the month?
(Pause.) Well, give me a clue.

ScoTT
Think. Top to toe. Top to toe.

POPPY

ScoTT
Boots, Poppy - boots!

POPPY
Oh, here we go!

ScoTT
Every week, I ask you, please wear
appropriate footwear, and every week
you insist on wearing those stupid
boots.
88.

POPPY
Yeah, yeah - sorry about that.

sScoTtT
You know what this is? This is vanity
before safety.

POPPY
Oh, right.

ScoTT
“I'm sorry, Mrs Jones - I’m sorry.
Poppy killed your child, but don’t
worry: she looked really cool in her
sexy, seductive boots.”

POPPY
Are they keeping you awake at night,
Scott?
ScoTT
No.
POPPY
Are you sure about that?
ScoTT
(No reply)
POPPY
Shall we get on with the lesson, then?
Yeah?
ScoTT

Are you going to do something about
your boots?

POPPY
No, I don’t think so - they’re fine.
I’m comfy in these. A lot of people
drive in heels.

ScoTT
Very well. On your head be it.

POPPY
Yeah. Okey-dokey.

(The car sets off down the road.)

ScoTT
Keep to the left of the centre -
Enrahah, Enrahah. When we come to this
bend, what do we do?

POPPY
Oh, yeah - expecting the worst!
89.

ScoTT
We keep to the left - okay, we expect
the worst - we expect the juggernaut -—

okay?
POPPY
Expecting the worst! -
ScoTT
We expect the worst -
POPPY
Ready -
ScoTT
Okay, more gas.
POPPY
Expecting the worst, expecting the
worst -
ScoTT
More gas, more gas.
POPPY
Expecting the worst...
ScoTT
More gas.
POPPY
OH, NO - THERE’S A JUGGERNAUT! - GET
DOWN!!!

(She ducks down. SCOTT grabs the wheel.)
ScoTT
POPPY!! KEEP BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL,
AND KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD!!!!
(They have turned the corner.)

POPPY
There’s a juggernaut.

ScoTT
What're you doing?

POPPY
That was a juggernaut!

(The car has stopped. There is no traffic in sight.)

ScoTT
There wasn’t a juggernaut!

POPPY
There was!
90.

sScoTtT
That’s a stupid thing to do.

POPPY
It was a little joke!

sScoTtT
That was a stupid thing to do.

POPPY
I’m sorry - it was a little joke! I’m
sorry, I’m sorry!

ScoTT
Give me gas! Give me gas - let’s get
away from the bend. Give me gas.

A few moments later. The car pulls up by a wall and
some trees.

ScoTT
Right, Poppy...

POPPY
Yeah.

ScoTT

I’m not going to allow you to endanger
both of us, just for you to have your
stupid little joke - okay, I mean, if
you want to make jokes, if that’s what
you want to do -

POPPY
Yeah?

ScoTT
Then I will gladly sit here, and you
can take the mickey out of me for
twenty-two pound fifty an hour - it’s
your money - I’m big enough, I can
take it -

POPPY
Can you?

ScoTT
But, but I will not allow you to
endanger yourself, myself and other
road users just for your amusement.

POPPY
I wasn't taking the mickey, Scott,
alright - I’m sorry.
91.

(She touches his shoulder.)

scott
DON’T TOUCH ME!! DON’T YOU DARE TOUCH
ME!!!

POPPY

Alright! Alright!

(SCOTT leaps out of the car.)

ScoTT

Right. That's it. Get out.
POPPY

What’s happening now?
ScoTT

Get in the passenger seat.
POPPY

Why?
ScoTT

The lesson is over. I’m taking you

home.
POPPY

Oh. So that’s that, then, is it?
Alright, then.

(She gets out. They change places.)

ScoTT
And you can speak to the office, and
when they ask you, you can tell them,
I can’t teach you.

(They both get into the car. SCOTT loses his temper
with his seat-belt.)

scott
FUCKING THING!!!

POPPY
It's alright, Scott - it’s alright!
(Pause.) Well, come on, then, let’s
go. It’s costing me enough money, as
it is.

ScoTT
All I ask is that you behave like an
adult.
92.

POPPY
What, like you, Scott?

(SCOTT bursts out of the car again, and marches round
to POPPY's side.)

POPPY
It’s like musical cars, this.

(SCOTT opens her door.)

POPPY
What now?

sScoTT
Get in the driver's seat, please. I've
never given up on a pupil.

POPPY
Oh, so that bit’s over, is it? (She
takes off her seat-belt.) Well, make
your mind up. (She gets out of the
car. ) D’you want to have a walk, get
a breath of fresh air, or something?

(SCOTT ignores her, gets into the car, and slams the
door.)

POPPY
No? Alright, then. (She goes back
round the car, and gets into the
driver's seat.)

ScoTT
Check your mirrors.

A few minutes later. They are driving along.

POPPY

What about that guy you gave up on the
other week, eh?

ScoTT
He passed his test this morning.
93.

POPPY
Oh? That’s good.

ScoTT
He didn’t deserve to. He was very
rude. He didn’t even say thank you.

POPPY
I don’t know. Some people. It doesn’t
take much.

ScoTT
It's just the little things.

POPPY
That’s right.

sScoTT
Enrahah. (He points to the mirror,
then adjusts her steering.) Keep to
the left of the centre of the road.
You know, you can make jokes while
you're driving, Poppy, but you will
crash, and you will die laughing.

POPPY
(laughing)
Well, if you’re gonna go, it’s the
best way to go, I suppose! (Pause. )
Are you scared of death, Scott?

ScoTT
No, I’m not scared of death. I’m
scared of dying. That’s why I woke up.

POPPY
Oh, when d’you wake up?
ScoTT
A long time ago.
POPPY
Who set the alarm?
ScoTT
I set the alarm. I opened my eyes, and
I saw.
POPPY

And what did you see?

ScoTT
I mean, you can laugh while Rome is
burning, but believe you me, Poppy, it
is burning, and if you don’t wake up,
then you will be burnt to a cinder.

(POPPY looks at him reflectively.)
(Pause. )

94.

ScoTT
I mean, look around you - what do you
see? What do you see? - Do you see
happiness? Do you see a policy of
bringing happiness to people? No, you
see ignorance and fear. You see the
disease of multiculturalism. And what
is multiculturalism? Multiculturalism
is non-culturalism. And why do they
want non-culturalism? Because they
want to reduce collective will. The
American Dream never happened. The
American nightmare is already here. I
mean, look at the Washington Monument.
It is five hundred and fifty-five feet
above the ground, and a hundred and
eleven feet below the ground. Five
hundred and fifty-five plus a hundred
and eleven is six hundred and sixty-
six. Six-six-six, Poppy. Six-six-six.
(Pause.) Keep to the left of the
centre of the road.

POPPY
Are you an only child, Scott?

ScoTT
Enrahah. Use all your mirrors. Watch
your speed.

(Another reflective glance from Poppy.)

Later. The car pulls up opposite POPPY’s flat; causing
a small flock of pigeons to disperse. POPPY takes out
her money, and gives it to SCOTT.

POPPY
Same time next week?

ScoTT
Of course.

POPPY

Of course! (She gets out.) Stay happy!

(SCOTT drives off. POPPY crosses the road, to the

flat.)
95.

Shortly later. POPPY and ZOE’s living-room. POPPY is
sitting by the window, sorting through her bag. ZOE
walks over to the window. She is holding some CDs.

ZOE
Oh, come on, Suzie.
POPPY
Don’t worry, she’ll be here.
ZOE
What time’s Helen expecting us?
POPPY
She wanted us there by four.
ZOE
She’s going to go nuts!
POPPY
Not much I can do about that - runs in
the family.
ZOE

How was your lesson?

POPPY
I dunno...dark.

ZOE
How d’you mean, dark?

POPPY
Dark as the night.

ZOE
He hasn't been feeling you up, has he?

POPPY
I'd like to see him try.

ZOE
Touching your knee, instead of the
gear-stick - that old chestnut.

POPPY
No.

ZOE
You alright, Poppy?

POPPY
Yeah. I think I’m just worried about
Helen.
96.

ZOE
Really? How d’you mean?

POPPY
I should’ve gone to see her ages ago.

ZOE
Yeah, families, eh?

(SUZIE appears across the road.)

ZOE
Oh, here’s Suzie.

(SUZIE sees ZOE. She smiles and makes a rude gesture.)

ZOE’s little yellow car speeds out of the city. At the
seaside, it drives along the coast road and the
promenade, past the fun-fair.

Then it proceeds along a quiet, modern, suburban street
with neat lawns, finally screeching to a halt outside a
bland, semi-detached house. HELEN and her husband JAMIE
appear at the door, as ZOE reverses, then pulls into
their driveway. Much laughter and jollity from POPPY,
SUZIE and ZOE inside the car.

HELEN
Hello!

JAMIE
Alright?

(POPPY throws some luggage out of the car. Then she
gets out, clutching some flowers.)

POPPY
Look at this! Oh - mind the tree!

(She runs towards HELEN, who is standing in the porch.
She passes JAMIE, who is on his way to the car.)

JAMIE
Alright, Poppy?

POPPY
Alright, Jamie?

(POPPY kisses JAMIE on the cheek, then proceeds to
HELEN, who is very pregnant.)
97.

POPPY
Look at you!

(She kisses HELEN. JAMIE joins ZOE and SUZIE, who are
getting stuff out of the car.)

ZOE
You alright, Jamie?
JAMIE
Alright? Yeah.
ZOE
Long time no see.
JAMIE
Yeah, long time no see. You alright,
Suzie?
SUZIE

Alright, Jamie?

JAMIE
Alright?

(POPPY starts running back to the car, but remembers
the flowers in her hand.)

POPPY
Ooh. These are for you.

(She gives HELEN the flowers, and runs back to the
car.)

POPPY

Lovely....
ZOE

I got you a bottle of bubbly.
JAMIE

Oh, thank you very much. That’s

lovely.

(POPPY gathers up her things.)

Minutes later. JAMIE comes into his living-room with
POPPY’s luggage. POPPY and SUZIE are laughing. POPPY is
holding her shoulder bag and her boots.
98.

JAMIE
Alright? I’1l put these upstairs for
you.

POPPY
Oh, lovely, Jamie. Thank you very
much.

(JAMIE goes upstairs. SUZIE goes out onto the patio.)

SUZIE
I guess we’re having a barbecue.

POPPY
Whatever gave you that idea, Suzie?

(She laughs at a picture in a frame. JAMIE returns from
upstairs.)

POPPY
Keep on running, Jamie!

JAMIE
Yeah.

(He disappears into the kitchen.)

POPPY
Better put these down, shall I? That’s
a good idea.

(She joins ZOE in the hall. SUZIE arrive from outside.)

POPPY
(to ZOE)
Oh, having fun, yet?

ZOE
(drily)
Yeah.

(HELEN shouts from the kitchen.)

HELEN
Take your shoes off, Suzie!

SUZIE
(angrily)
Alright! (She kicks them off.)
99.

HELEN
And you, too, Poppy. I’ll give you a
grand tour. (She goes into the
toilet.) This is the downstairs
toilet.

POPPY
Oh, I thought it was the wine cellar.

ZOE
I wish!

(HELEN leads the others into the living-room.

HELEN
Through here, this is the living-room.

JAMIE
Ta-da! Yeah, we went with a blue-and-
silver theme in here.

POPPY
Oh, did you, Jamie? It’s very nice,
isn’t it, Suze?

SUZIE
Yeah.
HELEN
Here’s our little dining area.
POPPY
Lovely.
HELEN

There’s usually another chair here,
but we've put it outside for later.

POPPY
What, for the foxes?
HELEN
(acknowledging joke)
Yeah.
JAMIE
Yeah.
HELEN
We only got this last week, didn’t we,
Jamie?
JAMIE
Yeah - flatpack.
ZOE
(drily)

Really?
100.

(POPPY laughs.)

A little later. POPPY is standing in the middle of
HELEN’s garden. ZOE is smoking a cigarette and holding
an ashtray. SUZIE is lurking in the background. HELEN
joins POPPY and ZOE.

POPPY
Beautiful, Helen! Haven’t you got
green fingers, eh?

ZOE
Is it alright to smoke, Helen?

HELEN
Yes, s’pose so. Can you make sure you
get the ash in the ashtray, please?

ZOE
Yeah - I’1l try not to miss the potty.

POPPY
You’ve been trained, haven’t you?

HELEN
Come and see my roses.

(POPPY joins HELEN enthusiastically.)

HELEN

I only planted these last year.
POPPY

You didn’t!
HELEN

They've done really well. I want to
grow them into a big bush.

POPPY
Oh!

(ZOE sniggers and POPPY hits her playfully.)

HELEN
Yeah. They look lovely.

POPPY
Yeah, don’t they, just!

HELEN
And my lavender...put that by the
compost.
101.

POPPY
Best place for it, really.

HELEN
Hydrangea wants perking up a bit.

POPPY
Bit down in the dumps, is he? Hello,
there - might never happen!

HELEN
Busy Lizzies are doing very well.
POPPY
Oh?
HELEN
Beautiful flowers.
POPPY
Been a bit busy, has she?
HELEN
Going to plant more of these next

year.
(SUZIE has joined them. )

SUZIE
That looks crap.

HELEN
Thanks, Suzie. (She points to a tree.)
Eucalyptus.

POPPY
Oh, Zoe - gum tree!

ZOE
(simultaneously)
Gum tree!

POPPY
Brings back a few memories, doesn’t
it? (Australian accent) G'day blue!
How's it goin’?

(JAMIE arrives with a tray of drinks.)

JAMIE
Drinks up!

ZOE
Oh, cheers, Jamie - let me give you a
hand.

POPPY

Oh, cheers! Lovely!
102.

(The drinks are dispersed.)

ZOE
Cheers, everyone!

POPPY
Cheers!

HELEN
Cheers!

JAMIE
Cheers!

Now the women are all sitting round the table on the
patio, enjoying their drinks. JAMIE is standing,
attending to the barbecue.

POPPY
So you've spoken to Mum, then, have
you?

HELEN

Yeah, I spoke to her last Sunday.
She's alright.

POPPY

Lovely. Is she coming down?
HELEN

Yes.
SUZIE

What’s she coming down with, syphilis?
(POPPY and ZOE chortle.)
HELEN
(unamused)
When did you last speak to her, Suzie?

SUZIE
Oh, leave it out!

HELEN
You should give her a ring.

POPPY
I spoke to her.

HELEN
They're both very excited.

POPPY
Of course they are.
103.

HELEN
They’re going to come down when the
baby’s born.
POPPY
Yeah.
ZOE
Get on with the in-laws, then, do you,
Jamie?
JAMIE
Yeah, I do, as it goes.
HELEN
Yeah. You get on with Dad, don’t you?
JAMIE
Yeah, we have a nice chat from time to

time.

(POPPY and SUZIE laugh.)

SUZIE
Do you?
POPPY
It’s more than we ever do!
HELEN
(to POPPY)

Doesn’t it seem funny, your little
sister having a baby?

SUZIE

Yes - it is a bit weird.
POPPY

No, it’s perfectly natural.
ZOE

I’m an auntie.
JAMIE

Oh, yeah?
ZOE

Yeah, I’ve got two nieces - my
brother’s kids.

POPPY
Yeah, they’re lovely, aren’t they?

ZOE
Yeah, well, they’re alright.

HELEN
He’s kicking.
104.

(POPPY feels HELEN's tummy.)

POPPY
Oh, yeah - that’s amazing! Hello,
little man in there! It’s your auntie
speaking! There’s your other auntie
here, Auntie Suzie - does she want a
word?

SUZIE
What’re you gonna call it?

POPPY
No! (Laughs.) Oh, yeah - have you
chosen a name yet?

JAMIE
We weren’t actually going to say, were
we?

HELEN
We’re not telling anyone yet.

POPPY
Oh, go on - your secret’s safe with
us!

HELEN

No, it’s bad luck.

JAMIE
It’s Nathan.

(Pause. POPPY and ZOE are amused.)

POPPY
It’s lovely.
SUZIE
Nathan?
JAMIE
Yeah.
POPPY
It’s a lovely name, Helen.
ZOE
Is there a Nathan in the family, then?
JAMIE
No.
HELEN

No. Just feels right.
105.

ZOE
Right.
POPPY
Well, that’s the important thing.
SUZIE
Nathan Lightfoot.
HELEN
Yes, Suzie - Nathan Lightfoot.
POPPY
“Nathan Lightfoot, Esquire”!
SUZIE
It's boring!
POPPY
Take no notice of her!
HELEN
It’s not.
POPPY
Cheers! Cheers, Nathan!
JAMIE
Let me get you another top-up. Suzie?
SUZIE ZOE
Oh, yeah, please. Thanks, Jamie.
POPPY

Lovely. Thanks.

Later in the evening. HELEN and JAMIE’s living-room.
The curtains are drawn and the lights are on. All five
are sitting around. SUZIE is next to the television.

(Pause: a conversational hiatus.)
POPPY
I know: let’s have a go on your Play
Station, Jamie.

SUZIE
Oh, yeah.

POPPY
- Yeah!

(JAMIE gets up and joins SUZIE.)
106.

JAMIE
Yeah, I’1l start it up.
HELEN
No, Jamie!
POPPY
Zoe's favourite, isn’t it, Zoe?
ZOE
(drily)
Yeah, I just can’t get enough.
SUZIE
What games you got?
JAMIE
‘Sonic The Hedgehog’, ‘Splinter
Cell’...
SUZIE
Oh, cool.
HELEN
We can’t start with that now, Jamie.
POPPY
Why not?
HELEN
It’s too late.
SUZIE
Shut up!
POPPY
Why, what’s the time?
JAMIE
Five minutes...
HELEN
No!
SUZIE

Come on, let’s play.

HELEN
Jamie, I said leave it!!

POPPY
(touching her arm)
It's alright, lovely.

HELEN
Sit down!
107.

SUZIE
Oh, for fuck’s sake!

(JAMIE goes back to his chair.)

ZOE
Bane of my life, Play Stations.
JAMIE
Oh, you got one?
ZOE
No, the kids at school.
POPPY
(miming)

They're like that, under the desks,
aren’t they?

HELEN

I always confiscate them in my class.
POPPY

Do you?
SUZIE

Oh, what a surprise!
POPPY

They must love that.
JAMIE

Well, maybe in the morning, eh?
POPPY

Yeah. Before we go for a walk.
JAMIE

Yeah.

(Pause. )

HELEN

Incredible to think I’m going to get
even bigger.

(POPPY mimes HELEN's bulge exploding.)

HELEN
Only ten more weeks.

POPPY
Exciting! Strap yourself in. (Safety-
belt mime.)
108.

HELEN
Doesn't it make you both feel a little
bit broody, you girls?

POPPY
No, actually. How about you, Zoe?

ZOE
‘Fraid not, with all due respects.

HELEN
But you want a baby, though, don’t
you, Poppy?

POPPY
No, thanks - I’ve just had a kebab!

HELEN
I didn’t mean that. Eventually.

POPPY
Maybe. Who knows?

HELEN
At thirty-five, you're considered a
high-risk mum.

POPPY
Oh, give me a chance - I’ve just
turned thirty!

HELEN
It's only five years away. You've got
to make plans.

POPPY
What, Five-Year Plan? Like Stalin?

HELEN
When are you going to get on the
property ladder?

POPPY
Oh, I need a step up, first!
HELEN
You got to get yourself a mortgage.
ZOE
We don’t want the hassle.
HELEN
You really need to invest your
savings.
POPPY

Oh, I just stuff mine under the
mattress, Helen.
109.

HELEN
You got yourself a pension yet?

POPPY
You gotta be joking. Have you got a
pension?

HELEN
Of course - we've both got pensions,
haven't we, Jamie?

JAMIE
Oh, yeah.

POPPY
Oh, great! Where d’you keep your
Zimmer Frames?

HELEN
You’ve got to take life seriously,
Poppy.

POPPY
Have I?

HELEN
You can’t go on getting drunk every
night - partying. However much fun it
is.

POPPY
I don’t get drunk every night. Do we?

ZOE
No - she’s an adult now, your big
sister.

POPPY

("quotes"” gesture)

“Unfortunately”.

HELEN
You have to take responsibility,
Poppy.

POPPY

(touching her gently)
Okay - take it easy, darling.

HELEN
I am taking it easy. I just want you
to be happy, that’s all.

POPPY
I am happy.

HELEN
I don’t think you are.
110.

POPPY
I am. I love my life. Yeah, it can be
tough at times - that’s part of it,
isn’t it? I've got a great job,
brilliant kids, lovely flat; I’ve got
her to look at, I’ve got amazing
friends. I love my freedom. I’m a very
lucky lady - I know that.

HELEN
Alright - there’s no need to rub it
in.

POPPY
What? What am I rubbing in?
HELEN
I know what you’re saying.
POPPY
What am I saying?
HELEN
You think I’ve taken the easy option.
POPPY
Hey!
ZOE
Hang on, Helen - she didn’t say that!
HELEN
That’s what she meant!
POPPY
No, I didn’t.
SUZIE

No, you're just blatantly insecure
about your own life.

POPPY
(firmly)
Alright, Suzie!

HELEN
That’s not true, Suzie.

SUZIE
Well, then why are you trying to
control everyone else?

HELEN
I’m not!

SUZIE
Yeah, you are!
111.

HELEN
No, I’m not!
SUZIE
Whatever. You’re boring me.
POPPY
Leave it, Suzie!
HELEN
Why are you all attacking me? It’s not

fair!!

(She gets up and runs out, slamming the door.)

ZOE
No-one’s attacking you!
JAMIE
We’re not attacking you, Hel.
(Pause. )
POPPY
Blimey!
SUZIE
It's pathetic!
POPPY
(remonstrating)
Suzie!
SUZIE
Sorry.
JAMIE
She’1l be alright in a minute.
POPPY
Yeah.
JAMIE

It’s hormones.

(POPPY and ZOE share a sense-of-humour moment.)

ZOE
You alright?
POPPY
Yeah.
(Pause. )
SUZIE

D’you want to play a game, then,
Jamie?
112.

JAMIE
Yeah, yeah...

(He starts to get up, but Helen returns.)

JAMIE
No - let’s leave it ‘til the morning.

HELEN
I think we should all go to bed now.
It's getting late.

POPPY
Alright, then.

HELEN
Jamie, go upstairs - get the bedding
for Suzie. (JAMIE gets up.) You're
looking tired, Suzie.

ZOE
She always looks like that.
SUZIE
It’s just my face.
ZOE
Thanks for the barbecue, Helen. Jamie.
JAMIE
Any time.
POPPY
It was gorgeous.
SUZIE
Yeah, thanks.
HELEN
We'll go for a walk by the sea
tomorrow.
POPPY
Be lovely.
HELEN
Be nice.

(SUZIE looks less than enthusiastic.)

The next day. On the promenade at HELEN’s seaside town.
Crowds of holiday-makers and day-trippers. A fun-fair
not far away; a long pier stretching out to sea.
113.

POPPY and SUZIE run along the beach wall exuberantly.
ZOE, HELEN and JAMIE are more subdued. POPPY persuades
JAMIE to give her a piggy-back, much to SUZIE’s
amusement and HELEN’s consternation. But JAMIE’s back
hurts, and POPPY gets off him with great concern. They
all move off. Two large bearded men sit on the wall.

Later, on the way home to London. At a petrol station.
ZOE is filling up. SUZIE lounges on the back of the
car. POPPY is a little distance away, talking on her
mobile.

POPPY
I’m alright - how are you? Good
weekend? Huh. Heavy night, last night,
was it? That’s what I like to hear.
Good boy! Well, d’you fancy going out
some time, then, do you? How’s Friday
looking for you? D’you think you can
squeeze me in? (She laughs.) Oh, go
on, then - I don’t drink. But...yeah,
Maybe just the one. (Another laugh.)
Yeah - somewhere like that. Alright,
then. See you then, then, then - then,

then... (She laughs, and walks towards
the car.) Alright. See you, sailor.
Bye.

Now ZOE’s car drives along a leafy street. As they near
the corner, POPPY suddenly spots SCOTT, standing under
a tree. He is looking in the direction of their flat.

POPPY
Scott!

(On seeing POPPY, SCOTT immediately runs off at great
speed. ZOE parks outside the flat. They all get out of
the car. ZOE and SUZIE attend to the luggage. POPPY
crosses the road to look for SCOTT. But there's no sign
of him. Concerned, she walks back to the flat.)

Minutes later. POPPY and ZOE are standing together,
looking out of their living-room window. SUZIE is in an
armchair, reading a magazine. Pause.

ZOE
What was that all about, then?

POPPY
Search me.
114.

ZOE
Bit weird.

POPPY
Isn't it, just? It gives me the
creeps, to be honest.

ZOE
Yeah.
(Pause. )
POPPY
So, what are we doing for tea, then?
ZOE
Takeaway - what d’you reckon?
SUZIE
Chinese.
POPPY
Oh, hello! Look who's here - little
piglet!
ZOE
Yeah, are you paying?
SUZIE
No.
POPPY
Course she’s not!
ZOE
Don’t worry, we'll take care of it.
POPPY
Mum and Dad?
ZOE

Which one am I?

POPPY
Dad, of course!

ZOE
I hate being Dad!

POPPY
You love it! (She kisses ZOE.)

ZOE
Oh, get off, Poppy! (She walks away.)

(SUZIE goes back to the magazine. POPPY looks out of
the window. )
115.

POPPY
It's a beautiful sky.

(We see the sky. It is beautiful.)

In a bar. POPPY carries two drinks from the counter,
and joins TIM at a table.

TIM
Thanks.

(POPPY sits down.)

POPPY
So where were we? What brings you
here?

TIM
I met a girl.

POPPY
Oh! Very nice! What’s she like then?

TIM
I can’t talk about it.

POPPY
Can’t you? Why not?

TIM
It’s a secret.

POPPY
I’m good with secrets.

TIM
It’s between me and her, though.

POPPY
Oh, fair enough. I won’t pry. Who is
she?

TIM
I couldn't, possibly.

POPPY
Trust me.

TIM
She’s a teacher.

POPPY
Is she?

TIM
She’s gorgeous.
116.

POPPY
Oh? I hate her already! Haven’t you
got lovely eyes?

TIM
Thanks.

POPPY
Beautiful colour.

TIM
Really?

POPPY
Yeah.

TIM
Picked ‘em myself.

POPPY
Did you? Where from?

TIM
Down the market.

POPPY
You’re joking me.

TIM
No.

POPPY

I'd say you’d got yourself a bargain
there.

TIM

You’ve got one, as well.
POPPY

Have I? Just the one? Which one?
TIM

That one.
POPPY

This one?
TIM

Yes.
POPPY

Particularly lovely, is he?

TIM
He is! You don’t want to upset the
other one, though.
117.

POPPY
Oh no, she’s alright.
TIM
Is she?
POPPY
Yeah. We’ve had a chat about it.
TIM
Oh, good.
POPPY

Yeah - she’s over the worst, now.
Yeah. Anyway, she’s got other talents.

TIM
Has she?

POPPY
Oh, yeah.

TIM
What are they?

POPPY
So many. She can juggle.

TIM
Obviously.

POPPY

Yeah - goes without saying. She can
wink on demand.

TIM
Really?

POPPY
Yeah.

TIM
Let’s see.

POPPY
Are you sure?

TIM
Yeah.

POPPY
It’s pretty spooky.

TIM
Go on.

POPPY

Aw...okay, are you ready?
118.

TIM
Yeah.

(POPPY winks elaborately)

TIM
She is good!
POPPY
This one tries to join in.
TIM
Don’t let him!
POPPY
I won’t. Anyway, he’s lovely, so -
TIM
Well, she’s lovely, too.
POPPY
Don’t try to claw your way out of it
now!
TIM
Sorry!
POPPY
‘ts alright! Cheers!
TIM
Cheers!
(They clink drinks.)
TIM

Again.

(A warm moment between them. )

TIM
This is nice.

POPPY
It is nice.

(A smiling, loving moment.)
119.

Dusk. A modern block of flats. POPPY and TIM are
walking along a top-floor exterior landing. They arrive
a flat with a bright yellow door.

TIM
Here we are.

POPPY
Wow!

TIM

Welcome to my humble abode.

POPPY
Thank you!

(They go in. Just as the door closes, they kiss.)

In TIM’s bedroom. Clean, simple design. A big, low
lamp. Venetian blinds. POPPY and TIM are kneeling on
the bed, kissing.

POPPY
Aren't you high up?
TIM
Yeah.
POPPY
Yeah. What’s it like up there?
TIM
‘ts okay.
POPPY

Oh. (TIM lowers his position.) That's
better. (More kissing.) I think you
must be too hot.

TIM
Yeah, it does feel hot.

POPPY
Yeah, I thought so. I’m usually right.
(She undoes his shirt.) Though it’s
not really my job.

TIM
No - you’re very good at it.

POPPY
I know. Hidden talents. (She takes off
his shirt.) Oh, wow! (She strokes his
body.) Now that’s what I calla
bargain!
120.

TIM
Yeah?

POPPY
Yeah. (They kiss again. POPPY slides
the bangles off her wrists, letting
them fall to the floor.) One, two,
three! I’m a bit hot, too...

TIM
Yeah?

POPPY
Yeah.

TIM

Maybe this'll help? (He helps her off
with her top.)

POPPY
I think you might be right.

TIM
What about if this...(He is referring
to her vest.)

POPPY

Oh, yeah, and that one.
TIM

Yeah?
POPPY

Go on, then. (The vest gets stuck on
her head.) Oh! I quite like it like
that! Oh! (They laugh. She slides the
vest onto his head, and they continue
kissing.) What's it like in there?
(She pulls the vest back over her own
head, so that they are now both under
it. Laughing and still kissing, they
fall on to the bed. After a few
moments, they get rid of the vest, and
love-making proceeds. )

Next morning. POPPY and TIM are on his private balcony,
leaning on the balustrade, and looking out at the
London cityscape. She is wearing one of his t-shirts.
They are a foot or so apart. POPPY slowly slides
towards him. They share a warm moment. Then they kiss.

TIM
I’1l go and make that tea.

POPPY
Okay.
121.

(He goes inside. POPPY stays to enjoy the moment.)

A FEW SECONDS LATER. TIM IS MAKING THE TEA. POPPY JOINS
HIM AT THE KITCHEN COUNTER.

POPPY
I’m gonna be late for my lesson.
Heigho! There you go.

TIM
I’1l give you a lift.
POPPY
Will you?
TIM
Yeah. Means I keep you for longer.
POPPY
Thank you very much.
TIM
Its okay.
POPPY

So when are coming back to school?

TIM
Oh...next week? I’1l see how things go
with his mum.

POPPY
He'll be alright.

TIM
He'll be fine.

(POPPY crosses her fingers. Pause. A warm moment.)

POPPY
Hello!

TIM
Hi.

(The warm moment continues. Then TIM takes the milk
from the fridge, and attends to the tea. POPPY watches
him.)

POPPY
Are you happy...in your life?

TIM
That’s a big question.
122.

POPPY
Isn't it, just?

Now POPPY and TIM rush out to TIM’s car, jump into it,
and drive off quickly.

ZOE is leaning in her living-room doorway, holding a
book and a mug. TIM is on the landing.

ZOE
So you play football, then?
TIM
Yeah, five-a-side, every week.
ZOE
Oh, right. Is that indoors or
outdoors?
TIM

No, outdoors.

(POPPY rushes down the stairs, and joins the others.
She has changed into jeans and a denim jacket.)

ZOE
Oh, here she is!

POPPY
Made it - just.

ZOE
Why aren’t you wearing any jewellery?

POPPY
Oh, it’s that kind of day!

(She laughs and combs and ties up her hair. TIM laughs,
too.)

ZOE
So are you doing anything tonight?

TIM
Yeah, it’s a mate’s thirtieth. A load
of us are meeting in a bar.

ZOE
Oh, great!

TIM
What are you two up to?

ZOE
Oh, cinema.
123.

POPPY
Yeah - see a film.
ZOE
Yeah, popcorn.
POPPY
Sit in the dark, hold hands - you
know!
ZOE
Yeah - no necking.
POPPY
She’s only saying that cos you're
here.
ZOE

Oh, yeah - normally I’m all over her
like a rash!

TIM
I don’t blame you!

(POPPY laughs, and hits him playfully.)

ZOE
He’s a right smoothy, isn’t he?

POPPY
Isn't he, just?

(The doorbell rings.)

POPPY
Oh - here he is! (Going.)
TIM
(going)
Nice to meet you, Zoe.

ZOE
Yeah, nice to meet you, Tim.

POPPY
Yeah, nice to meet you, Zoe!

ZOE
Yeah - whatever.

(POPPY and TIM go down to the street.)
124.

TIM
(off)
Have a good time tonight.

POPPY
(off)
Come on, you!

(Z0E reflects for a moment; then she goes into the
living room to enjoy her book.)

Down in the street. The door opens, and out come POPPY
and TIM. SCOTT is waiting.

POPPY
Hiya, Scott! This is Tim - he’s coming
with us today. - Just joking!
(POPPY and TIM laugh.)
TIM

Hi.

(He holds out his hand to SCOTT, who doesn't respond.
He gives them both a disgruntled look, and walks off.)

POPPY
Oh! Can’t win ‘em all.

TIM
Apparently not.

POPPY
See you later, then.

TIM
I’1l call you.

POPPY
Will you?

TIM

Yeah, I will.

POPPY
Oh, good!

(They kiss. SCOTT observes them from the corner, then
walks off. The kiss over, TIM goes off down the street,
and POPPY catches up with SCOTT. They talk as they walk
quickly along a row of shops.)
125.

POPPY
So what happened on Sunday, Scott? You
should've stopped to say hello.

ScoTT
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
POPPY
Don’t you?
ScoTT
I was in Stevenage on Sunday.
POPPY
Stevenage?
ScoTT
Yeah.
POPPY
That's funny. You must have a twin,
then.
ScoTT

I was there all day. I was looking
after my mum. My aunt’s dying.

POPPY

Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.
ScoTT

It’s alright.
POPPY

I don’t believe you, Scott.
ScoTT

It's up to you. I was there ‘til

midnight.
(They have arrived at his car. They get in.)

POPPY
I don’t think so, gigolo!

(SCOTT drives off aggressively.)

A few minutes later. The aggression continues. SCOTT
becomes increasingly manic and hysterical. POPPY is
concerned - and even frightened.

ScoTT
Okay, concentrate, Poppy -
126.

POPPY
Yeah.
ScoTT
Concentrate. Watch what I’m doing,
right?
POPPY
Okay.
sScoTtT

Now I’m going to indicate - I keep in
lane. In a roundabout you keep in
lane, okay? You keep in lane -
alright?

(They screech to a sudden halt, too close to a taxi.
POPPY is nervous.)

ScoTtT
You take responsibility for other
drivers, and you take responsibility
for yourself. And you keep in lane,
okay? This is a roundabout.
Concentrate. Pay attention.

(They move off.)

ScoTT
Good.

(A white van cuts in.)

ScoTT
Are you - oh, yeah - was that a
request, or was that a demand? Did he
bully me then? Did he just shove in
then, or did he ask?

POPPY
Did he?

ScoTT
No, he didn’t ask. You see, what
roundabouts do? Roundabouts - if you
keep in lane, if you keep in lane, and
ou kee join ou're gonna be fine.
¥' P J! (oRE) g
127.

SCOTT (CONT'D)
You're following the rules, and you're
keeping everything the way it should
be - everything in check.

POPPY
Yeah -

ScoTT
But if you get selfish, if you get
selfish and you step out of it, then
it goes wrong, and it gets dangerous -
d’you see what I mean?

(SCOTT overtakes the white van, putting himself on the
wrong side of the busy main road. A cyclist crosses
SCOTT’ s path.)

POPPY
(Fingers in mouth)
Woowayah!!!

(A car horn sounds, urgently.)

ScoTT
I’m not waiting for him, I’m not
waiting for somebody who can’t keep in
lane on a roundabout, I’m not waiting.
Everywhere you see - look at the
cameras, look at them, everywhere you
go, they’re watching you, they’re
seeing you, they’re watching you,
they’re seeing you, they’re watching
you, look at them, everywhere you go.
This place, it stinks. COME ON!! WHAT
ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!!!

POPPY

(quietly)
Alright...

ScoTT
JESUS CHRIST!!! Look - another camera,
speed cameras. Why d’you need speed
cameras? There’s two guys in the back
of the road there, selling drugs, and
you have a speed camera. Why d’you
need a speed camera?

POPPY
Alright...

scott
You can wait. YOU CAN WAIT!!!

POPPY
He -

(She gasps. SCOTT sounds his horn violently.)
128.

ScoTT
COME ON!! DRIVE THE CAR!!! You’re not
driving a camel!! Okay? This is not a
bazaar. We have rules in this country -
we have regulations, and you keep to
them!!!

Now the car races violently along a quiet street.

ScoTT
(screaming)
FUCKING MORONS!!!

(The car screeches to a halt, hitting the kerbstone
sharply. SCOTT adjusts this position. Then he and POPPY
get out, and change places. She gives him a wide berth
as she passes him.)

Inside the car...

ScoTT
Right, check your mirrors, check your
seat. Make yourself comfortable.

POPPY
No, I don’t think so.
ScoTT
Put your seat-belt on.
POPPY
We’re not going anywhere, Scott.
ScoTT
What d’you mean?
POPPY
You're in no fit state to take this
lesson.
ScoTT

Poppy, I am the driving instructor,
you are the pupil.

POPPY
You need to calm down.
ScoTT
I am calm.
POPPY

You can’t drive like this.
129.

ScoTT
How dare you comment on my driving?

POPPY
I think I can comment on your driving,
when you’re putting yourself in
danger, you’re putting me in danger,
and you’re putting other people in
danger!

ScoTT
It’s not me - it’s them!

POPPY
That’s bullshit, Scott! It’s all
bullshit, yeah, that’s it - I don’t
want it.

ScoTT
What, you want this lesson to stop?

POPPY
Yes, I do. I don’t want you to teach
me any more, alright? I’m sorry.

ScoTT
Okay - great. Fantastic. You get in
the passenger seat, and I’1ll drive you
home.

POPPY
No, I don’t think so. You’re not
driving - I’m driving.

ScoTT
No, you're not!

POPPY
Yes, I am.

sScoTtT

Poppy, if this isn’t a lesson, then
you can’t drive.

POPPY
You’re not driving anywhere, Sunshine.

ScoTT
You’ve got two choices: either I drive
you home, or you walk.

POPPY
I don’t mind walking, but I can’t let
you drive this car.

ScoTT
You can’t stop me.
130.

POPPY
Yes, I can.

(She pulls out the ignition key.)

scott
Poppy, give me the keys.
POPPY
No.
scott

Give me the keys to my car.

POPPY
No, I don’t think so.

sScoTT
Poppy, I’m going to ask you one more
time please give me the keys to my
car.

POPPY
I’m sorry, Scott, I can’t -

(SCOTT grabs hold of POPPY's hair violently. She
screams. )

scott
GIVE ME THE FUCKING KEYS TO MY CAR,
YOU FUCKING BITCH!!!

POPPY
Get off me! Get off me, you -

ScoTT
Give me the keys!

POPPY
Get off me!

(They struggle and swear for a few moments, then POPPY
escapes from the car.)
sScoTtT

Give me the fucking keys!

POPPY
Get off me - you get away from me!

(SCOTT gets out of the car.)

sScoTtT
Give me the fucking keys!!

(POPPY runs round the rear of the car.)
131.

POPPY
You can’t touch me, Scott!!

(SCOTT runs round the front of the car.)

sScoTtT
Give me the fucking -. Give me...

(He moves round the car, but POPPY runs across the
road. SCOTT chases her.)

POPPY
You can’t touch me, you’re out of
order, Scott!!

sScoTtT
Give me the fucking keys!!

POPPY
You’re out of order! You’re out of
order - I’m calling the police!!

(SCOTT stops dead.)

POPPY
D’you want me to call the police? Do
you?

(Pause. A car drives past.)

POPPY
Right. So let’s just calm down, shall
we? Okay? We’re disturbing the peace
here.

ScoTT
I just want to get in my car, and
drive away.

POPPY
I’m sorry, Scott, that’s not going to
happen.

ScoTT

Jesus Christ, Poppy! You’re doing it
again - you never give up, do you? -—
YOU NEVER GIVE IN, FOR FUCK’S SAKE,
YOU FUCKING BITCH!!!!

POPPY
Scott, you need help.
132.

scott
DON’T PATRONISE ME!!

POPPY
I’m not patronising you.

ScoTT
Yes, you are patronising me - you’re
always patronising me.

ScoTT
This is what you always wanted - this
is what you set out to achieve, this
is the game you played. You prodded
me, you poked me, you stroked me, you
teased me, you flirted with me, you
sucked me in. You wore your high-
heeled boots and your short skirt and
your low-cut top, and you flashed your
tits, you tossed your hair, you played
with the gearstick - YOU LIED TO ME!!
This is all about you. The world has
to revolve around you. I’m a driving
instructor. I just wanted to do my job
- you had no intention of learning how
to drive. You got in that car with one
thing in mind: to reel me in. And why?
Because you have to be adored - you've
got to be wanted. And you drink it in,
and you leave me, with a spring in
your step; and you go off, and you
fuck your boyfriend, and you fuck your
girlfriend, and you all drive around
in that stupid little yellow car!!

(Pause. POPPY watches him. He lowers his eyes.)

POPPY
Scott...

(Pause. )

POPPY
Come on, now.

(Pause. Kids can be heard playing somewhere nearby. )

ScoTT
I just want to go home.
(Pause. )

133.

POPPY
I’m sure you do. (Lightly) Don't we
all, eh?

POPPY
I’1l tell you what. Why don’t we have
a talk about it? We’ll sit in the car;

POPPY
and we’ll have a chat, okay? Alright?
And then I’1l give you your keys.

(Pause. The children can still be heard playing. SCOTT
walks quickly to the car. He sits in the driver's seat.
POPPY watches him for a moment. Then she walks across
the road, goes round to the passenger side of the car,
bends down and looks through the open window. SCOTT is
in a very emotional state.)

POPPY
I’m sorry if I upset you, Scott. I
wish I could make you happy.

ScoTT
I was happy.
POPPY
Okay.
ScoTT
And I was in Stevenage last Sunday.
POPPY
Sure.
ScoTT

You can ask my mum.

(Pause. POPPY looks at him.)

ScoTT
So, same time next week?

(It takes POPPY a long time to reply.)
134.

POPPY
I’m sorry, Scott.

(She gives him the keys.)

POPPY
There you go. I’1ll just get my bag,
alright?

(She opens the rear door.)

scott
I’m a good driving instructor.

POPPY
Yeah, I know you are.

(She has retrieved her bag. She closes the door, and
looks through the front window again.)

POPPY
Take care, Scott.

Scott
Was that your boyfriend?

(POPPY looks at him.)

Scott
Before. Was it?

(He is in tears. POPPY continues to look at him. There
isn't a reply. A long pause. Then SCOTT starts the car,
and drives off.

POPPY stands on the pavement for a while. Then she puts
her bag over her shoulder, and leaves.

POPPY now takes a long, reflective walk along a busy
shopping street. Then she sits on some steps, and
reflects some more.
135.

And then, a little while later, she’s on a lake ina
London park, in a rowing-boat with ZOE. There are a few
other boats around.

ZOE
I think I should give up smoking.
POPPY
(laughing)
That's a good idea. What can I give
up?
ZOE

You could give up being too nice.
(POPPY laughs) Seriously: you can’t
make everyone happy.

POPPY
There’s no harm in trying, though, is
there? Bring a smile to the world.

ZOE
Come on, Poppy!
POPPY
I know. I know.
ZOE
I still think we should call the
police.
POPPY
No. That’s not going to help him, is
it?
ZOE
I dunno.
POPPY
You know what?
ZOE
What?
POPPY

We're lucky, aren’t we?

ZOE
Yeah, we are. Well...well, you make
your own luck in life, don’t you?

POPPY
Some of us do. Some of us miss the
boat completely.

ZOE
Yeah, it’s hard work, being a grown-
up, isn’t it?
136.

POPPY
Yeah, it is. It’s a long trip.
ZOE
Yeah, tell me when we get there.
POPPY
(laughing)

Don’t worry! I’1l let you know! You
keep on rowing, and I'll keep on
smiling...

ZOE
Are we there yet?

(POPPY laughs. Pause.)

POPPY
We've got a hell of a way to go.

(PAUSE. They've rowed a little distance.)

POPPY
We're getting good at this, aren’t we?
Nothing to it.

(POPPY's mobile rings. She takes it out of her bag,
laughing in recognition.)

POPPY
Hello, you! Missing me already? That’s
nice to hear. Nightmare. Yeah. I’m
still alive - just. Well...it’s a long
story. I’m on a lake. With Zoe.
(Laughs.) Yeah. The bathroom flooded.
Yeah. It’s alright now. We found a
boat. (Laughs.) You're funny!
(Laughs.) Yeah...

The camera has risen into the sky; white birds circle
round the boat as we look down on it.

It floats away. And POPPY keeps on laughing.

End credits.
