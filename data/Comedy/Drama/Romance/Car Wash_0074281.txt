CAR WASH

 

FADE IN

EXT. "DELUXE" CAR WASH - SIGN - EARLY MORNING, SUMMER

The screen is filled with the two words CAR WASH as the
camera pans off the sign and slowly begins to travel through
a closed Car Wash in downtown Los Angeles. It is a silent
moment as the camera moves through the empty, lifeless com-
plex in the early morning light. Slowly traffic and radio
sounds fade in. © .

CAR RADIOS

(mixed with

traffic noises;

fading in

and out)
..-President blah, blah, blah...
Camp David...Talks resume with
blah...blah...blah...

The sounds and light and slow movement of the camera. all give
the sense of the elaborate complex waking up, coming alive.
The camera continues to move slowly through the darkened

Car Wash and across the locked gate to include....

2 THE CORNER

where a bus stops and a young black man-in his early thirties
gets off the bus carrying a paper bag and starts toward the
Car Wash. He is Lonnie.

MORE RADIO SOMEWHERE
++-The Coke Bottle Bomber struck
again last night. This time at
the Shrine Auditorium. Fortunately
one of the ushers spotted the Coke
Bottle Bomb minutes before....

3 FRONT GATE

Lonnie moves to the front gate where the camera now includes
a huge, fat black man in his late twenties. He sits on a
petite motor scooter, and holds a transistor radio to his ear.
He has been waiting for Lonnie to open the gate. This is

Hippo.
LONNIE

STREET - FRONT CAR WASH . 4

As Lonnie opens the gate the camera moves to include the street
behind them where a beat up pickup truck full of Chicanos stops.
A young, energetic Mexican in his early twenties jumps out of
the truck and slams the door. This causes one of the rusty
fenders on the truck to fall off, crashing noisily into the
street. Some of the men on the truck tie the fender back on (X!
while the young Chicano joins Hippo and Lonnie but is busily
watching some “hot" looking girls who. pass by. He crosses
himself and looks up to heaven as he catches a glimpse of one

of the girls bottoms in her tight jeans.

HIPPO
(indicates truck) (x,
All you need is some chickens....

CHUKO

Very funny, man...you know, some
day you gonna jump on that scooter
and...

(he makes a loud

swallowing, sucking

sound)
+..it's gonna take Roto Rooter to
get it out....

STREET - FRONT CAR WASH 5

As the men enter the Car Wash the camera moves to include an
old. Cadillac in perfect shape, with a FOR SALE sign in the

back windows. The car is being driven by Slide, a crafty black
man in his early thirties. He looks around for a parking spot.

ACROSS THE STREET 6

On a side street facing the entrance to the Car Wash a black
man in his mid-thirties, dressed very snazzily, adjusts the tilt
of his hat using a store window as a mirror. It is obvious

that everything he wears is brand new. He nervously adjusts

his tie now. He is T.C.
 

#00353 : 3

ACROSS THE STREET 7

Slide opens the back of his car and starts pulling out para-
phernalia: boxes, a small suitcase, what he needs for the
day. He closes the trunk and, taking out an official-looking
white canvas bag, he pulls it over the parking meter near his
car. The bag is printed: “OUT OF ORDER, L.A.P.D." Pleased
with himself, he heads for the Car Wash.

INT. CAR WASH LOCKER ROOM 8

,
Lonnie, Chuko and Hippo's transistor radio drones the news in
the b.g. An older black man in his fifties enters coughing.
He is Charlie.

 

HIPPO
You coughin' better, Charlie....

CHARLIE
Yeah...yeah....

EXT. STREET - IN FRONT CAR WASH 9

An old army jeep, painted bright red and the victim of many (x
crashes, zooms loudly down the main drag in front of the

Car Wash and turns the corner near’ the entrance. The young
black maniac in the front seat is Geronimo, who wears a head~
band with a feather in the back, and next to him a young, hip
American Indian named Goody. In the back seat is a young

white guy, also in his early twenties, he has short hair and
looks like someone who just got out of the army. This is
SCRUGGS. He hangs on to the roll bar of the jeep as they

zoom past a Mustang that sits stopped near the entrance.

MUSTANG 10

A young black boy in his early twenties sits with his girl
friend in the Mustang. It is obvious they have just had an
argument. They both sit in silence, smoldering, as a car
radio somewhere babbles on with the news. Suddenly the boy
jerks the car door open and, jumping out, slams the door be-
hind him and, goes into the Car Wash. He is Justin.

 

THE GIRL FRIEND 1]

She is very upset as she watches him for a long moment and ;
then drives off. As she drives off screen, the camera picks (3
up T.C. as he peers into the window of a small soul food
luncheonette directly across the street from the Car Wash
entrance. The luncheonette is. called The Five Spot.

An old, thin black man carries a brown paper bag and shuffles
to the shoeshine stand which is part of the Car Wash complex.

He is Snapper.

As Snapper opens up the shoeshine stand a beautifully kept
Impala pulls in behind him into a special parking space.

CAR WASH PARKING LOT - CLOSE SHOT - CAR DOOR . is

The door opens and a very arrogant black man in his mid-
thirties steps out. His shoes are polished and his pants have
a sharp crease. This is Earl. He closes the car door and
grandly passes Snapper.

SNAPPER

Earl gives him a grand nod without even looking at him.

in a vaineffort to hide a pair of undershorts he is wearing
with red hearts all over them and the words "HOT STUFF."

LOCKER ROOM DOOR . 21

Suddenly the mirth is cut by the appearance of Earl. He
stands in the doorway dramatically and glances at his watch.

EARL
I believe it is exactly two minutes
and eleven seconds to opening....

There is total silence except for Earl's clipped footsteps
as he grandly walks to his locker and opening it bends over
to untie his shiny shoes. As he does, the sound of the
loudest fart ever heard comes from somewhere in the locker
room.

EXT. CAR WASH - BIG JOE BURGER STAND 22

On the corner near the bus stop, and actually incorporated
into the car wash complex, is a hot dog and hamburger
stand called Big Joe Burgers. This is run by Joe and Terry
Graziano, an Italian couple in their late twenties. . Terry
thinks she is a sex symbol and Joe is insanely jealous.
They are opening up the stand.

TERRY
I didn't look at him...we were both
stopped for the red light....°

white owner of the car wash, and his nineteen-year-old son

Irwin get out of the car.

SNAPPER |
Mornin', Mr. B....

 

MR. B.
Mornin', Snapper....

Mr. B. heads for the effice. Irwin sports an "Afro" and
wears shades. He also wears a T-shirt with a picture of
Mao Tse-tung on it. Irwin thinks he is very cool and very
jive. He has adopted a kind of black "hip" delivery, but
it is really not natural for him.

SNAPPER
An' how you doin', Mr. Irwin?...

IRWIN’
Hey, baby...what's happening?...

He tries to give Snapper a2 really jive, elaborate, cool,
"inside" handshake. Snapper has trouble keeping up with
it..

SNAPPER
I just can't seem to get that....

IRWIN
Lay back, baby...Catch you later....

Irwin walks on.

THE CORNER 24

Cars begin to line up waiting for the car wash to open.

A taxi pulls up in front of them as Marsha, the white
cashier, arrives at work. Marsha is in her late twenties
and very sexy. She's got a bad nose but the greatest tits
in the whole world.

A bummy black Hooker who's been out all night sits in another
taxi in a traffic jam. She is wasted and in need of repair

as she casually watches Marsha enter the car wash. This gives
her an idea.

steps out of the locker room dressed in coveralls and rubber

They grin from ear to ear as they realize the opportunity to
"get" Irwin. Lindy does a long take on Irwin.

LINDY :
An' stoned to the tits, honey....

As a loud song starts over the loudspeakers Irwin joins the
men. It is his initiation. Naturally no opportunity is

spared to hose him, spray him, hit him with wet rags and

runny suds. He is so stoned and his own natural clumsiness
doesn't help the situation either as Irwin flounders and slips.
At the end Lonnie helps him up.

LONNIE . ve . ae : 313

LONNIE
I'm glad you came back...You
shouldn't have run off like that....

Duane seems very strange.

LONNIE
I'm gonna talk to Mr. B. tomorrow
«.eHe'll take you back....

DUANE
I didn't come to talk, Lonnie
«eI came for the money.

Duane moves forward into the light now. He holds his hand
in his windbreaker Pocket where the light now picks up the
bulge of a gun. ; /

 

LONNIE
What you talkin’ about?...

' DUANE
Give me the money....

Duane seems desperate.
LONNIE
Is this what you was plannin' with
Tony Fredericks this afternoon?

LONNIE
Listen.... .

Sweat pours down Duane's face.
: DUANE
Jus' give me the money, Lonnie...
I don' wanna hurt you....

Duane moves closer but Lonnie holds his ground.

LONNIE
Well, tha's the only way you gonna
get this money.... -
DUANE
You'd protect the exploiter pig's
money?...~
LONNIE

I ain' protectin' Mr. B's money,
I'm protectin' you...This ain't
no way, Abdullah...I learned it
the hard way.

Duane moves closer. He seems even more desperate.
DUANE
Get away from the money, Lonnie
«Did you hear me...get away....

They are face to face. Lonnie holds his ground.

DUANE

Every emotion runs through him now in a split second. He
finally breaks. He can't hurt Lonnie.

LONNIE
(gently)
Give me the gun, Abdullah...Come
on...give me the gun....

Slowly, Duane removes a piece of metal pipe from his jacket
pocket. He puts it down on the counter as he breaks down.

He continues to break down as Lonnie watches painfully.

LONNIE

with Rose....

DUANE

him sadder) -

back on the stuff...you know
what'll happen to me if I go see
her...Nothin's workin'...it's all
a mess...I don' know what to do....

Lonnie touches him now.

LONNIE
I know, Abdullah...I know....

Lonnie holds him, feels very deeply for him, then smiles.

LONNIE

and spaghetti on Friday nights...
The kids will love it...and Muriel

"DUANE
(pulling himself

together)
Ah, Lonnie....
