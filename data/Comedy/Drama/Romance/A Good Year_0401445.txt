EXT. CHATEAU LA SIROQUE - LATE AFTERNOON i

A rustic Provencal farmhouse, surrounded by rows of well-kept
vines. Up above, the sky is a sparkling jewelbox of stars,
Down below, all ig quiet, except for the chirrup of the
cigales...

 

EXT. FARMHOUSE - GARDEN - SAME 2 :

A gorgeous trellis of jasmine and honeysuckle is lit by a :
pair of flickering candles. Beneath it, MAX SKINNER, age 12, !
sits alone, puffing a cigar while staring at a cheas board, ;
pondering his next move. An old vadio broadcasts in

French...

FRENCH DJ
La prochaine chanson est exécutée
ce soir par Josphine Baker...

MAX
(practicing French)
La pro-shane.,.shan-sone...est ex-6-
cu-tée...

Josephine Baker’s “Breezin’ Along With the Breeze" comes
on...as Max’s eyes drift across the garden--

MAX’S POV - ENTRANCE TO THE WINE CELLAR

A shaft of light spills out from the cellar. Downstairs, we
can HEAR wine bottles being moved and RATTLED.

BACK TO SCENE

Max taps his ash. His eyes anxiously dart between the
chessboard and the cellar entrance. Pinally, with the ease
of an experienced con artist, Max slides his bishop one
Square forward,,,just as he hears footsteps climbing the
stairs. Max quickly crosses his arms, resuming his pose of
deep contemplation.

THE WINE CELLAR

Emerging from the cellar ig Max’s UNCLE HENRY, early-50's,
Uncle Henry is a sermonizing eccentric, with warm, knowing
eyes, and the countenance of a man who hasn’t worked very
hard for a very long time. He wears a pair of pajamas -~
shirt-top opened, revealing a round Buddha belly. He puffs
on a cigar, as he crosses the lawn, swinging a bottle of
red...
09/19/2005

UNCLE HENRY
Max my boy -- seeing that it’s your
last night here, I thought it only
appropriate that we open something
extra special...

1A,
09/19/2005 2.

He presents the wine with the flourish of a waiter,

UNCLE HENRY
Tempier Bandol. 1969. The kind of
wine that’1l pickle even the
toughest of men... I once saw a
Castilian prizefighter collapse
into a heap after drinking just a
single glass. Of course, my knee
landing squarely on his testicles
may have been partly to biame.

He begins opening the bottle.

UNCLE HENRY
What was I talking about before?

. MAX
Blue suits.

UNCLE HENRY
Blue suits?

MAX
You said the importance of a good
blue suit can never be overstated.

UNCLE HENRY

Quite right. A blue suit is the
most versatile of accoutrements...
But even more important than the
suit itself is the tailor who fits
it for you. Take note, Max: once
you find a good tailor, you're not
to give his name away -- not even
under the threat of bodily harm.

Uncle Henry pours a glass for himself. One for Max. Then
spills a little water into Max‘’s glass, just to soften it a
bit. He takes a seat.

UNCLE HENRY
Now where were we? Whose turn is
it?

MAX
Mine.

Uncle Henry suspiciously studies the board. He quickly
suspects that Max has moved his bishop.

 
09/19/2005 2A,

 

 

UNCLE HENRY
Max, have I told you why I enjoy
making wine so much?
09/19/2005 3.

MAX :
You don’t make the wine, Uncle |
Henry, that guy Duflot does,

 

Max points out to the vineyard:..where -- far off -- a lone
PIGURE rides a tractor across the land...

UNCLE HENRY

You’re starting to sound like a
communist, Max. In France, it’s
always the landowner that makes the
wine, even if all he does is
supervise with binoculars from the
comfort of his study...

(swirls his wine)
Now then -- I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar is,
quite simply, incapable of lying.
You see Max, all the work we do
here at La Siroque -- all the
Planting, all the harvesting, all
the fermenting -- it’s nothing more
than the art of bottling truth,
Par example: if perchance one year
it rains too much, the wine will
tell you that very easily, by the
depth of it’s color...

(holds the wine up toa

candle)
And if it rains too little, itll
tell you that too...in it’s aroma
and bouquet...

(sniffs the wine)
Pick too early, pick too late, it i
Matters not -- the wine will always }
whisper into your mouth with i
complete, unabashed honesty, every :
time you take a sip... i

(takes a sip)
Abhh... Delightful.

(then; serious)
So Max-a-million...now that you
know why I love wine so much, do
you have something you want to tell
mée...?

i
i

Max looks at his Uncle, poker-faced. Then down at the chess
board.

MAX
Yes. I do.
UNCLE HENRY

Well..,what is it?

Max gulps his wine.

Then, moves his

EXT. LONDON - LAWTON BROTHERS OFFICE BUILDING - MORNING 3

A three-story glass and concrete box at the top end of
Threadneedle Street. A title reads:

MANY VINTAGES LATER...

INT. LAWTON BROTHERS - BOND TRADING BULLPEN - MORNING 4

A platoon of young, Saville Row-draped BOND TRADERS git at
their desks -- uncharacteristically quiet. They wear the
faces of soldiers who are about to enter battle. KENNY, an
overly-eager Australian trader, 20’s, eyes his computer,

KENNY
115.10, Max. Feels like we oughta
Move now.

Kenny glances across the bullpen to his boss, the team’s
Managing Director. It’s MAX SKINNER, almost 40. Max is a
handsome, self-absorbed, rascal of a man whose desire to win
knows no limits. He gits with his feet up on his desk,
wearing an exquisitely tailored blue suit, reading the
Financial Times.

MAX
Not yet, Alf.

KENNY
Boss, why do you keep calling me
Alf?

MAX

Because you're an Aggressive Little
P-er, Kenny. And as your boss, and
genetic superior, I can call you
what I like. Now let the price
come to you...not the other way
around,

A phone RINGS. Max’s assistant answers. She is GEMMA
TAYLOR, mid-20's, a bright and attractive Englishwoman with a
playful, oftentimes abusive, wit.
09/19/2005 4a.

GEMMA

One moment please.
(to Max)
It's Kimberly.

Max gives her the “thumbs down”,

GEMMA,

(into phone) .
Sorry Kimberly, Mr. Skinner isn’t
here. He and his fiancee are at
their wedding rehearsal today...

115.40?

The team snaps into gear and awaits Max's signal. Max
watches the price of the bond on his screen...

MAX
Okay people...just remember: we’ re
net here for the dental Plan. At
my signal, unleash hell...

Max stands. Walks to the window. Stares across the City to
a sleek, Girkin building: Lustig Bank.. his competitor.

KENNY

INT. LAWTON BROTHERS “CIRCUS CLUB’ - MINUTES LATER io

The place is filled with plasma screens that broadcast
business reports from all over the world, as well ag health
food counters. The gang from Lawton Brothers serenades its
leader, soft’ drinks swinging in the air, as Max eracks some
“illegal” bottles of bubbly into plastic cups.

GANG
“ -- for he’s a jelly good fell-
ohhh! Which nobody can deny!"

~> then, with the tiniest of voices --

GEMMA
I can!

Applause, cheers and {much to Max’s consternation) calls for
“Speech! Speech!" Max steps atop a chair,

MAX
Were you not entertained!? WERE!
YOU! NOT! ENTERTAINED!

The mob cheers. Max settles them with aplomb.

MAX
Well. Today, I think we proved
that old adage correct: “Winning
isn’t everything, ..

ALL IN UNISON
++-IT’S THE ONLY THING!”

MAX
Great work today, everybody!
Really. Thank you for it!

Max applauds his team...and makes brief eye contact with a
TWENTYSOMETHING BEAUTY across the space.

MAX

Our competitors will say that what
we did today exploited a loophole.
That we “crossed a line” and broke
a “sacred covenant of trust” within
the bond trading fraternity. Well,
to them I respectfully say:

(as erudite as possible)
“Ha ~- hal"

Big cheers. It’s good to be Max Skinner.

INT. SMALL FLAT - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 10a

Post-coitus. The Twentysomething Beauty lies naked on the
bed, snoring, her sumptuous body tangled within the sheets.
Max, gripping hia clothes in a ball, creeps out of the
apartment, checking his hair in the mirror before he leaves.

chauffeured home.

+-.and while not technically
illegal, Lawton Brothers’ actions
this morning represented an
unprecedented breach of financial
etiquette. Cries of ‘foul play’

floating in the foggy, dawn sky. Gekko’s “Greed ig Good”
quote is framed on canvas, dominating the largest wall..

Max skims through his mail. It's mostly junk, but there's

one intriguing envelope with a French stamp.

At a wet bar, Max pours himself a tumbler of scotch, decanter
in one hand, Appraising the letter: CABINET AUZET, NOTAIRES,

RUE DES REMPARTS, 84160, GORDES,

Max opens the letter. --his reaction is to walk through to the

living room a little crestfallen.

INT. MAX’S OFFICE - THR FOLLOWING DAY 15

 

A massive fish tank. Max leans against it, reading the

morning’s Financial Times, whose headline blares: “LAWTON
SCORES BIG IN DAWN RAID.” Kenny arrives in the frame, i
handing Max a shot of espresso, waving Max’s morning i
messages... :

KENNY
Ready for the fan mail?
(Max nods)
“Bastard.” “Bastard.” “Burn in
hell.” “Rot in hell.” "Die."
“Congratulations, you're my hero.”

MAX
Who was that from?

KENNY :
Your attorney. i

Max looks up. Gemma taps on glass from inside Max's office.

GEMMA
I just got off the phone with
Auzet, the notaire handling your
Uncle Henry's estate.

MAX

Oh! The one whe sent me the
letter,
GEMMA

Seems your uncle hadn’t updated his
will in over twenty years. Which
is why, in typical French fashion,
it took them a month to notify you,

MAX
So? Ig there going to be a reading
o£ the will or do we just
“download” that sort of thing these

days?

GEMMA,
That's the point, Max: there is no
legal will.

As Max digesta that, Kenny enters behind her.

MAX

KENNY
(intrusively)
A place like that must be worth a
pretty penny these days, eh?

 

Max look at him, annoyed at the intrugion.

GEMMA

appointment with Auzet for three

MAX

proudly as evidence)
See -- everybody hates me.

KENNY

Max has to give this pause,

INT. HIP RESTAURANT - CORNER BOOTH - NIGHT 17

Swarms of Notting Hill lovelies fill the restaurant. Max
enters, and skillfully wades his way through the crowd of
admiring women, kissing many, whispering to others...

Meanwhile, CHARLIE WILLIS, mid-30’s, real estate broker,
casts furtive glances at his WAITRESS’s pert bosom while she
pours him a taste of red wine.

CHARLIE

arguments, protests, etc.

EXT. TENNIS COURT - SECONDS LATER 36 |

It’s a weedy clay court, surrounded by a rusted fence. The i}
court is covered with leaves from a tree that’s been planted 4
on the edge. The tree spreads dappled shadows across the

court, In the distance, Max steps through the rotting gate

and takes in the scene, a surge of nostalgia bubbling up...

UNCLE HENRY VOICE
Match point, Max!

WE ARE NOW IN A FLASHBACK...
09/19/2005 19a.

MAX'S POV - ON HIS LEFT AT THE FAR END 37

UNCLE HENRY -- wearing too-tight Dunlop shorts and a pair of .
ratty sandals -- stands holding a tennis racket in one hand,
and a glass of white wine in the other.

 
09/19/2005 20.

MAX'S POV - ON HIS LEFT

YOUNG MAX -- wearing a headband and wristbands and looking
like a pint-sized version of dohn McEnroe, bad tempered.

YOUNG MAX
It's too dark to play Uncle Henry!
I can’t see!

UNCLE HENRY
Nonsense, Max, at your age I could
spot a hyena on-the veldt at three
quarters of a mile.

Uncle Henry lines up his serve. THWACK! Dead-center. Max
lunges for the ball as if his life depended on it, but misses
anyway.

UNCLE HENRY
Ace! Game, set, match!

Uncle Henry dances in the “end zone” in celebration. Pissed,
Young Max slams his racket to the court...and walks toward
the service box to examine the line.

YOUNG MAX
YOU CAN’T BE SERIOUS!

Uncle Henry continues to gloat...without mercy.

YOUNG MAX
You don’t have to rub it in!

UNCLE HENRY
The veal question, Max, is why you
aren’t celebrating.

YOUNG MAX
Because I lost.

Uncle Henry pours himself a refill from a day cooler on the
court . :

UNCLE HENRY
Max...a man should acknowledge his
losses as gracefully as he
celebrates his victories...
(goading)
Now give us a jig...for your old
Uncle's sake...

Following orders, Young Max makes a half-hearted attempt to |
dance around the court. . —

UNCLE HENRY
Try harder, Max-a-million! Focus!
Arms up in triumph!
(not happy with his

performance)
Dance boy -~ don’t shimmy like an
Ttalian!

Young Max raises his arms, but he’s just not feeling it...and
abruptly stops.

MAX
This is stupid.

Uncle Henry crosses the court and tussles the hoy’s hair.

UNCLE HENRY
Someday, Max, you'll come to see
that a man learns nothing from
winning. The act of losing,
however, can elicit great
wisdom...not the least of which is
how much more enjoyable it is to
win... It is essential to lose now
and then... The trick is not to
make a habit of it...

THE PRESENT.

EXT. VINEYARD - LATER 38

Max walking through the vineyard. Kneelgs down. Notices that
there are roses at the head of each row. Stoops down, scoops
up some dirt, and sniffs it. Makes a face. Ugh.

OFFSCREEN VOICE
Chickenshit...

Duflot appears from out of the vines...trailed by his blue
dog Tati.

DUFLOT
It ig the only thing for them,

Before Max can react, Duflot kisses him three times on the
cheeks, then bearhugs him. Duflot's a real sweaty guy with a
persistent swarm of gnats whirling around him.

MAX
Monsieur Duflot? My God,
you’ve...uh...matured.

still, I have my wife Ludivine, and
my dog Tati, who is loyal,
affectionate, and...

MAX

Max stares down at the blue terrier. BARK! BARK!

DUFLOT
{gestures; c’est la vie)
I expect you are-hungry, no? My
wife is tonight roasting a lamb--

MAX
Thank you, but no. I am tired, and
don’t have much of an appetite...
since I learned about Henry.

DUFLOT
{tear in his eye)
In the last few years, his sight
was failing. But I attended ta
things for him. We became very
close, you know?.. Almost like
father and son.

MAX
(cynical)
I’m happy that someone was here to
take care of him.

DUFLOT
Bon! Ludivine will come in the
morning...with croissants...she
will resume her duties.

MAX
If you insist. Well... Bon nuit,
Duflot. .

DUFLOT
A demain.

Max heads back to the house. He feels like he’s being
watched, so he stops, turns, and sure enough, Duflot is
watching him...only his head is showing.

Duflot gestures with a smile, then disappears like a ghost in
the gloaming, as we...

MAX
Ah...La Siroque,

INT. UNCLE HENRY’S STUDY - MINUTES LATER 40 |

Max spies an old record player with a stack of 45’s balancing
in position on the silver spindle. Henry’s final playlist!
Max turns the player on, lines up the records...and lets the
first record drop... Noel Coward's voice CRACKLES:

NOEL COWARD
“...a room with a view, and you,
and no one to hurry us...

MAX
(singing the rest)
...MO one to worry us...”

Max peruses photos of Henry. Inspects a wall overstuffed i
with books (Greene, Maughm, Waugh, Wodehouse}. Then, raises i
the glass, affectionately, to a photograph of. Uncle Henry |
grinning back at him. :

MAX
Here’s to you Henry. For devoting
your life to the vines, and :
bottling the truth... '

Take a sip. Runs the wine around his palate, Nods in \
recognition.

MAX
Well, that was honest...

He opens a window and spits it out.

Max stands in only his socks and boxers, scrubbing the tomato

Sunlight streams through a window. Max appears at the top of
the stairs, in his uncle’s weathered bathrobe, barefoot. He
yawns, squints at the daylight.

INT. CHATEAU LA SIROQUE - KITCHEN 42

An opened refrigerator offers Max little. He scours in
particular for one item, without luck:

MAX
Coffee, coffee, coffee... Shite.

Max, breakfast under his arm: a litre of milk and a hunk of
cheese...shuffles towards the door as...

~- MADAME DUFLOT enters, stout in purple sweats and a bird’s
nest of orange hair, carrying a vacuum cleaner and bucket.

MAX
Madame Duflot.

MADAME DUFLOT
Ah, Maxie, Maxie, Maxie!

She kisses him three times on the cheeks. Ruffles his hair.
fakes him in. He has grown since she last saw him... Madame
Duflot proceeds begins to playful scold Max -- far assuming
she would not bring him breakfast, for wearing that bathrobe
when there’s a perfectly good one she laid out for him, for
drinking milk out of the bottle, etcetera, etcetera. She
snaps the milk and cheese out of his hands and shoos him
outside. Max doesn’t understand a word.

MADAME DUFLOT
(shooing him out)
Attendez dans le jardin! Je vous
apporte le petit dejeuner! (Mr.
Max, go to the garden! I will
bring his breakfast!)

EXT. GARDEN - AT THE CHESS TABLE - MOMENTS LATER 43

her tatoos)
Mr. Skinner?

MAX
Hmmm?
(snaps out)
Sorry.

Max signs the paperwork in front of him.

NATHALIE
in the arrangement, the vigneron
makes the wine, the estate owner
maintains the Property. C’est
simple. The proceeds of the wine
are then shared equally. This is
how your uncle and Monsieur Duflot
worked for over thirty years.
Naturally Monsieur Duflot will be
anxious as to your intentions.

Bon, let Monsieur Duflot make the

MAX
I don’t think you quite understand,
Ms. Auzet. My life-is in London.
And I don’t do weekends. I plan on
selling La Siroque as soon as
possible.

She looks up. Removes her glasses.

NATHALIE
Henri would approve of this?

Max smiles a little to himself.

MAX
Tell me, how well did you know my
Uncle?

Auzet gives a tiny cough. Max smirks to himself. He thought

MAX
So then...as you know...the chateau
Was Uncle Henry's passion. But
it’s not mine. I'm sure he would

NATHALIE
And what of Monsieur Duflot? He

estate for thirty years. If not
dealt with properly, you. could be --
how do you say -- caught between a
“rock and a stone?”

MAX
Charming... But I fail to see the

belt). Rummages through the fridge. Grabs a day-old
croissant. Cup of coffee.

Max, on the phone, eats. Intercut with Charlie (in London)
as Max wanders around the house,

MAX
On the contrary, Charlie, I’ve
decided to stay for a couple of
days. You know, smell the lavender
and relax.

INT. BASEMENT PLAT IN FULHAM - SAME 71B

Charlie stands in his kitchen in a paisley dressing gown,
scooping Nescafe from a jumbo-sized tin. The Financial Times
sits on his counter,

CHARLIE
“Relax?!” So it is true. You are
getting sacked!

MAX
I’m not getting sacked, Charlie.
I’m. ..exploring options with a view
to realizing thée-full potential of
my inheritance.

CHARLIE’S VOICE
In that case, how long before your
inheritance is ready to view?

INT. TOP CORRIDOR - MORNING 71¢c

Max sees two chickens strutting about. Sees a patch in the
ceiling that needs a Major repair.

MAX
It’s cogmetica stuff mostly. Just
needs a scrub and a coat of paint.
So shall we say, first viewing’s in
two or three days...?

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 71D

Max stops. Three days? Shit, He pulls at the flimsy
curtains. It showers him with dust, dead wasps, etc.

CHARLIE

MAX
No problem at all, Charlie.

Max wanders down the hall and opens the cellar door...

718 INT. CELLAR STAIRCASE - SAME TLE
MAX
Oh. One last thing. The wine they
make here... It is not, repeat not

first class.

CHARLIE’S VOICE
How bad can it be?

Max rummaging through bottles on dusty shelves,

MAX
Just gives you a blinding headache
and makes you angry. Best make
sure the buyers don’t know shite

CHARLIE’S VOICE :
Not a problem, old chap. Just make
sure she’s mateh-fit in 72 hours.

Max examines with interest bottles labelled with grease |
pencil: Le Coin Perdu. i

72 INT. GARAGE - DAY ‘ 72

.In a messy garage, Max digs among the junk. A few old
paintpots. Murky turpe. Finally he locates a paintbrush,
sitting in a tin of paint. Max jerks the brush out, seeing

it’s stuck in a chunk of congealed paint. He grabs the
turpentine and drops the paintbrush in it...then, spies a *
tire sticking out from beneath a sheet...

Max crosses the garage and whips off the sheet, revealing a
fire truck red Heritage Springer.

MAX
You dirty old bugger.

 

TOR EXT. DRIVEWAY ~ LATER 728

Max inspects the bike. Checks for oi1 and gas, drive shaft.

EXT. OUTSIDE LE CAVE - DAY 72C

Duflot sits in the sunshine, leisurely sharing his lunch with
Tati. On his head, a traditional black beret. Max

approaches, game-face on. There, on the ground beneath his
feet. The paintbrush.

MAX
The paintbrush. I was about to use
it. You took it. Why?

DUFLOT
C’est moi. It is my paintbrush.
Silence.
MAX
That‘s the only paintbrush in the
house.
DUFLOT

There is a hardware store in Apt.
They sell paintbrushes.

(sips his coffee.)
But, voila, it is closed today.

Max refuses to be beaten. Gets his wallet out.

MAX
Ok. This is fun. 1/11 give
you...20 Euros for it.

Duflot doesn’t react.

MAX
No? Fifty.
(No reaction)
Fine. I’11 give you a hundred

Max doesn’t blink. He regards his opponent.

MAX
You want to stay with your vines?
Fine. You help me fix up the
place. Do the gardens, paint the
house, help me with the pool. 72
hours of hard labor. You help me
construct this.lie, and I -- if at
ail possible -- will attempt to
convince the new owner of the worth
and value of your services and your
immortal harvests.

Stares at Max. Studies him. Duflot spits into his palm, and
extends it to shake.

DUFLOT
A Frenchman’s hand is his word.

Max spits a bigger hock into his own palm.

MAX
An Englishman's word is his bond.
They shake, spit merging.

DUFLOT

Duflot, up to his shins in slime, scoops up leaves and mud,
and dumps them into a bucket. Madame Duflot pulls the bucket
by rope, and unloads the crap into a wheelbarrow. PAPA
DUFLOT, 80's, watches this procedure, somnambulant.

INT. HENRY’S BEDROOM - DAY 72F
Max shoves the heavy bed across the floor to caver a huge
moldy patch. Behind-it he-finds a single stiletto shoe. He
smiles. Places it on the mantel as if it was a museum piece.
INT. SERVANTS QUARTERS - LATER 72G
The walls are exposed with old, rickety wood. Ants are
crawling everywhere. Max sprays with insecticide.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 72H
Max is throwing a load of broken tennis rackets into black

sacks. He pulls the basket they. were in away from the wall.
He stops. On the wall behind them is painted cricket stumps.

MAX
(softly)
Oh wow.

FLASHBACK - RAINY DAY 7ar

Young Max comes running down the corridor to bowl, releasing
the ball and clearing a wall shelf of about five vases,
halfway down the corridor. They SMASH to the ground.

Henry, smoking, is padded up in full cricket whites at the
other end in front of the stumps.

UNCLE HENRY

Hits the center stump.

INT. TOP OF STAIRCASE - DAY 725

Max, balancing precariously on a step ladder, is busy rolling

whitewash over crumbling, damp plaster. Duflot passes below
him.

DUFLOT
It will not last a month,

MAX
That’s someone else's problem.

He slaps on another coat.

MADAME DUFLOT (0.S.)
Monsieur Max!

“MAX'S POV - DOWN THE AIRSHAFT
Madame Duflot stares up, looking uneasy.

MADAME DUFLOT
There is...a person,

MAX
A person?

MADAME DUFLOT
(mot ioning)
At the door.

INT. CHATEAU LE SIROQUE - ENTRYWAY 73

Max opens the front door. Standing there: a pretty BLONDE
GIRL, 21, with a backpack. She’s wearing shorts, flip-flops,
and a San Francisco Giants baseball hat.

BLONDE GIRL
{perfect French)
Bonjour. Je recherche le
Propriétaire du domaine. (Good
morning. I am looking for the
owner of the estate.)

She amiles, flashing her blindingly white teeth.
: MAX

The only country that issues teeth
like that is America.

 

 

 
09/19/2005 44a,

BLONDE GIRL
Oh, you speak English?

MAX
Like a native.
09/19/2005 45.

BLONDE GIRL
My name’s Christie Roberts...I'm
looking for Mr. Skinner.

MAX
And you have found him.

CHRISTIE
(chuckles)
Impossible, you're way too young,

MAX .
(sexual innuendo)
Funny, I was just thinking the same
about you.

CHRISTIE
I meant too young to be my Dad.
Henry Skinner’s my father.

Clearly off of Max's doubt and mistrust, Christie fishes into
her knapsack, unearths a photo, and hands it to Max--

INSERT - PHOTO ON GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

A late 50's Uncle Henry poses-with Christie's Mother, 20's,
gorgeous, who wears a sexy, Jennifer Beals, hang-off-the-
shoulder sweatshirt,

MADAME DUFLOT (0.8.)
She has Henri’s nose!

Max turns -- Madame Duflot is looking over his shoulder at
the photo. Max steps out onto the landing, closes the door
behind him, shutting off Madame Duflot.

MAX
That‘’s your Mum?

CHRISTIE
(proudly)
In all her Flashdance-glory...
(excited)
So is he around?

Max stops...only now does he realize she doesn’t know.

MAX
You don’t know?

CHRISTIE
Know what?

09/19/2005

MAX
Oh. Right.
(pinches his nose)
Uh. Look,

He sighs, looks at her for some time.

MAX
Sorry I've forgotten your name.

: CHRISTIE
It’s Christie.

MAX
Christie. Look Christie...

CHRISTIE
Oh my God. He's dead, isn't he?

Max stops. Slightly impressed at her intuition.

MAX
A month ago.

Christie is crestfallen. Eyes welling up.
MAX
Cup of tea?

EXT, BASTIDE - MINUTES LATER

74

Christie sits at the chess table, recovering. PAN WITH MAX
as he emerges from the house with two cups of tea and a few

sandwiches.

MAX
So... California?

CHRISTIE
(sadly)

Mom was a tour guide in Napa
Valley. That’s where she met
Henry. He took the tour one day
and charmed her pants off.
Literally.

By the time she realized she was
pregnant, Henry was long gone...so
she never told him...then waited i
until last week -- my 21st birthday :
~~ to come clean with me.

(sighs)
Totally unbelievable...to come this
far only to find out he's.. -gone.

As Christie's eyes well up again-~-

Max spies on her from above, on his celiphone, quietly
conspiring with Charlie in London.

CHARLIE (0.8.) '
This is more than a wrinkle, Max. i
What if the girl turns out to be :
legit?

MAX /
She bowls up a couple of weeks
after he carks it? It’s too sweet :
Charlie. I’m not buying it. i

CHARLIE
You need some legal advice, mate.
And you need it fast, before the
little nymph cuts loose and makes a
mess of Chateau Skinner.

76 EXT. BASTIDE ~ CHESS TABLE - MINUTES LATER 76
Max rejoins Christie, who's admiring the estate...
MAX

Listen, Christie, I've just got to

pop into town.

She stuffs the rest of the sandwich in her mouth.

CHRISTIE (cont'd)
You mind dropping me? I’ve really
gotta get out of these clothes.

MAX

Why not get out of your clothes
here? We’ve got tons of space...
Rooms to spare. Clean up. Have
yourself a shower. I’11 be back in
no time...

(loud)
Madame Dulfot! A guest!

 

CHRISTIE
Wow, you sure?

MAX
Of course.

Max flashes a deliciously fake grin,as Madame Duflot charges
out to take care of Christie.

INT. MAITRE AUZET'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER 77

 

Max paces the office, apoplectic. aAuzet sits behind her
desk, studying the photo of Henry and Christie's Mom.

But she never even met my Uncle! * |

AUZET
Under French Law, there is no
difference between legitimate and
illegitimate children when it comes
to their right to inherit. In
theory, the girl would be entitled
to sole ownership of the estate.

MAX
Ridiculous! She could be an
imposter.

AUZET
That is precisely why she would be
required to produce some form of
documentation -- a photo or even
correspondence. If this is deemed
sufficient evidence, a DNA test
would then be ordered to establish
paternity.

HO Ok Oe

MAX
Dig the old boy up?! Bollocks you
will!

 
78

09/19/2005 49.

AUZET
Mr. Skinner, your Uncle Henri was
cremated.

MAX
(off the hook; relieved)
That‘s right... Great.

AUZET
However...viable samples can be
obtained from an old hairbrush, or
even a licked stamp.

MAX
(scheming)
Suppose I was to sell the
place...before she filed a claim?

AUZET

Legally, she could invalidate a
sale, even after the transfer of
title.

(Max, at wits end)
But this is all asauming the girl
wishes to make a claim, Perhaps
her intentions are harmless? My
advice is to treat her with the
utmost respect and hope she’ll be
on her way... French courte have a
way of favoring the lesser dog;
don’t make her one.

MAX
Courts?
EXT, MAIN STREET - DAY 78
Max walks back to the Smart Car, he pulls out into the main
street. The streets bustle with foot and bike traffic. Max
stops and starts. Gets stuck on a narrow street.
Through the half obscured windscreen he spots Fanny as she
walks practically over him carrying a tray. She serves a
table, then crosses back behind him to serve some tables
across the street.

She walke straight past him, almost pushing him out the way.

MAX
You tried to drown me,

FANNY
And you tried to run me over with
your little car!

MAX
What are you talking about..? What
do you mean I tried to run you
over?

PANNY
Down the road from La Siroque! You
were driving your midget Car on
your phone -~ and, I believe, had
your head stuck very far up your
ass! Look at the damage you have
caused me...1

She pivots and YANKS UP HER SKIRT on one side, revealing: an
ENORMOUS BLACK-AND-BLUE BRUISE adorning the most gorgeous
cheek since Eve. Max is a deer caught in headlights, along
with the rest of the male patrons of the cafe.

FANNY
(skirt down, at him again)
Faites attention fou! You try to
kill me, I try to kill you. Eh
bien, c'est fini.

She turns on her heel and marches back inside, unaware that
her skirt is stuck in her underwear. Max watches her,
transfixed. A small car crashes gently into a car in front.

MAX
My God. She’s fantastic.

EXT, GARDEN - LATER . 79

Max stares at the pool which is crystal clear now, half-
filled, water shimmering. Papa Duflot calmly skims the pool.
Beyond him, Max sees Duflot, wearing a white visor, on higher

ground, pulling a roller on the tennis court. Things are
looking good.

Max looks up.

CHRISTIE

Max, I can’t thank you enough for
inviting me to stay... Look at the

It is Cezanne country.

Christie notices a dish of moldy lavender on the sill
Gross. She tosses it out the window.

The court’s looking good. Duflot huffs and puffs with the

roller. Max reflexively picks up an old brush and whisks the

dust off the ancient plastic lines,

MAX
(cool)
Duflot...? This afternoon...in
town...there was a--

DUFLOT
Her name is Fanny Chenal.

Max is stunned. How does Duflot even know what he's talking
about? Max continues to brush. Duflot continues to roll on
the other side...at a distance...

DUFLOT
Many times I have seen this same
look on your Uncle’s face.
Max is impressed by Dulfot’s insight.

DUFLOT
But you deserve special credit.

Now Max is rifling through an old box that has eroquet *

ancient racquets, and balls. He stops in his tracks, as a- *
memory has come flooding back to him. *

DUFLOT * \
Who? . *
MAX *
Fanny, *
DUFLOT *
I believe so, yes. *
MAX
Is she.,..er...otherwise spoken for? *

Duflot is now winding up the net. Max places the racket
against the net measuring the height, motioning when to stop.

‘DUFLOT :
She was. Once! A football player * :
for Lyon. He wags shit...just like *

his left foot. And treated her
badly. Since then, it is rumored
that she will let no man near her
heart.

They are now facing each other across the net...

DUFLOT
Max, recall what Proust said:
‘Leave pretty women to men without
imagination,’

MAX
I’m a banker, Duflot. I have no
imagination.

Max lobs a racket to Duflot, which Dufilot catches. Max
points to his shirt. Fred Perry insignia.

Duflot smiles like a crocodile and tips his white visor. .

and Duflot appraise each other -- do we detect a moment of
camaraderie? The moment. is broken by Papa’s slow hand-clap,

DUFLOT
Bon.

Duflot walks off, with a sharp command--

DUFLOT
PAPA! TATI!

All follow, leaving Max, sweaty, bloody, and enjoying the

MADAME DUFLOT
Ach! Half the aristocrats in
France have liaisons with their

Madame Duflot leaves for the day. A gnarly meal awaits Max:

YOUNG MAX’S POV - INTO VAT

Filled to the rim with bubbling, fermenting red wine.

YOUNG -MAX
Fervere.
UNCLE HENRY
(confused)

Are you speaking in tongues, boy?

YOUNG MAX
(confident)
Fervere. It's a Latin term. It
Means “to boil.” The native yeasts

in your cellar are converting the
sugar inside the grapes to alcohol,
The release of carbon dioxide gas
is what causes the bubbling effect.

UNCLE HENRY
I must be suffering from dementia,
I don’t recall ever having taught
you that,

YOUNG MAX
You didn't. That Deflot guy

MAX
It’s bloody awful.

Same corks...

Completely different taste...
A little mystery, isn’t it?

MAX
Yes, well, Henry was a bit of a
mystery himself.

CHRISTIE
How so?

MAX
He loved England but lived in
France. He loved women but never
married. He loved adventure and
yet all my memories of him are
within a hundred steps of this very
spot.

CHRISTIE
Are they good memories?

MAX
No... They're grand...

-~ Max, with his jacket off and shirtsleeves rolled up,
taking orders from patrons. Of course, he doesn’t understand
a word anyone’s saying, but he doesn’t let that deter him.
Fanny approaches:

MAX
Relax. I’ve done this before.
FANNY
Where?
He stops.
MAX

I worked my way through University
in London’s Finest restaurants.

A desperate chef rings a service bell and balances two
beautifully presented confections on top of a bouef en
eroute. She has no choice. She grabs both plates and
thrusts them into Max's hands.

FANNY
Okay, you can serve. But if there
are any complaints, remember: in
France, the customer is always
wrong... Table six.

And off they go, in different directions, commencing:

A MONTAGE of Max's waiting tables. ‘Turns out he wasn’t
lying. He’s absolutely brilliant. His impression of a
French waiter proves to be infallible, except for the slight
shortcoming of his inability to speak the language.

My wife’ll have the Nicoise salad,

The last customer has left, the restaurant velaid for

FANNY
Monsieur Duflot is mistaken. I
only visited Gordes.during the

MAX
You know, I spent all my summers
here too. And I feel we may have
met at some point?

FANNY
Tf we did, I hope I was unbearable.

MAX

Look, I know it’s late but I was

I could spend my hard-earned tips
on a drink or two, to say sorry.

sternly)
What?

FANNY
Are you asking me on a date?

MAX
No. No. Just a drink. I mean I'd

EXT. BASTIDE - NEXT MORNING 98

The estate looks like a Cezanne canvas: another gorgeous
morning. Madame Duflot sweeps the courtyard. Suddenly, we
HEAR Christie SCREAMING from her room:

CHRISTIE (0.8)
Omigod: Help! Scorpions!

Max charges into the room.

MAX
Lavande! Lavdande|

Using his shoe, he stamps out the scorpions. He fishes out
the lavender dish from her garbage and slams it on the window
sill.

MAX
Lavande!

INT. UNCLE HENRY'S STUDY - LATER 9BA

Max sits at his Uncle’s desk, carefully examining the
estate’s accounting records, -which are exceptionally neat,
and all written in deep, green ink. Behind him, the record
player spins a Harry Nilsson 45. Madame Duflot ig on her
knees, scouring the floor.

Max throws some papers off the desk into a bin. He stops.

He picks up a RED WATERMAN FOUNTAIN PEN and rolig it in his
palm. He unscrews the pot of green ink and smells it. He

smiles. Remembering.

FLASHBACK. Uncle Henry on the couch, glass of wine on higsB
stomach. At the desk is Young Max, gripping the SAME PEN,
writing in Henry's checkbook, forging his handwriting.

YOUNG MAX
Pay to the order of...Francois
Hupert, plumber.

UNCLE HENRY
How much?

YOUNG MAX
87 francs.

UNCLE HENRY
(sighs)
Sign!

 
09/19/2005 61A.

Using Uncle Henry’s real signature as a guide, Young Max
flips it upside down, and copies the scrawl...

YOUNG MAX
H-e-n-r-y...S-k-i-n-n-e-r.

UNCLE HENRY
Who else, who else...?

YOUNG MAX
(rummaging through bills)
The mechanic?

UNCLE HENRY
(standing to pour wine)
Not a sou to that grease monkey !
The jag's still coughing up like
your Aunt Midge.

Uncle Henry leans over admiring the young forger’s handiwork.

UNCLE HENRY
You're a genius Maximillian. You
could be me.

INT. UNCLE HENRY'S STUDY - PRESENT , 39

Max puts the pen back, wistfully.

(whispers)
You could be me.

The next record drops. Needle hits the grooves. Edmundo
Ross. A rumba. Madame Duflot starts to subtly swing to the
music. From behind, it looks like the song is evoking an
intense, emotional memory.

MAX
(catching her eye)
Do you ever miss my Uncle, Madame
Duflot?

MADAME DUFLOT
He was an excellent dancer.

Max smiles. He thought so.

MADAME DUFLOT
Mr. Max? You will come to our
home.,.manger...ce soir.

MAX
Oh, I don’t know if that’s such a
good idea, Madame Duflot--

09/19/2005 63.

MADAME DUFLOT
Bon. It is settled. I must
prepare for your visite.

Madame Duflot exits in a frantic rush.

EXT. VINEYARD - MORNING 100

Christie sips coffee and wanders the vineyard. She reaches a
wall of brush that marks the end of the property-line. Then
notices a small, arch-like opening...and walks through it,
finding herself beneath a canopy of dense trees. She advances
toward a burst of light that floods through the outlet on the
other side of the grove...

Christie finally emerges into the blinding whiteness. When
her eyes adjust, she sees she’s standing on yet another
hectare of vines. Oddly, these vines aren't growing in dark
soil, but are planted in gleaming white, limestone rocks.
It’s otherworldly. -She kneels, and scoops up a wilted bunch
of embryonic grapes from the soil. Inspects them..,as she
atrolls up to--

A SMALL SHED

Upon which a very old pony is tethered. Christie picks up
some grass, which he feeds on, lazily.

DUFLOT (0.S.)}
He is called...Syrah.

Christie turna. Duflot steps out of the vines.

CHRISTIE
(in flawless French)
Named after a grape? How
appropriate.

DUFLOT
Ah, vous parlez francais?

Christie nods. He takes her hand. Now in Engligh--

DUFLOT
Francis Duflot, vigneron.

CHRISTIE
Christie Roberts, illegitimate
daughter.

 

b
09/19/2005 63A.

Duflot studies the pretty, young girl’s face. The loss of
Henry comes rushing back -- if only for a wounded moment...

 
09/19/2005 64.

DUFLOT :
The resemblance to Henry is |
unmistakable... i
(looks more closely)
The noge!

Christie touches her nose, starting to get self-conscious.

CHRISTIE
You knew him well?

DUFLOT

(nodding)
For twenty-three years I toiled i
side-by-side with your father. i
Even now...

(points up to heaven;

smiles)
..-he works from there...
points to the soil)
-.-and I from here.

She strokes the pony.

DUFLOT
Syrah was born the year I planted
the vines...but now they are both
sad and tired.

CHRISTIE
I’ve noticed. Many of them are
withered...
(glancing around)
...except here.

DUFLOT
(re: the hectare)
Tei? It is catastrophic! Nothing
but rocks and grief.

CHRISTIE
(points; naively)
They're limestones. They absorb
sunlight, then radiate heat at
night to keep the vines warm.

 

O£E his look of surprise.

CHRISTIE
(grinning disarmingly)
I‘m a wine brat. Spent my summers
working at a vineyard in
California.
09/19/2005 65.

DUPLOT
They do not make wine in :
California, they make Hawaiian mo
Punch.

CHRISTIE
Mondavi might argue that one.

DUFLOT :
Perhaps Henry’s daughter would be |
interested in a personal tour of , i
the vines?
(puts his.arm around her)
If we are lucky, his spirit will
join us...

 

Touched, Christie assents. Still curious about the hectare, i
she motiong into the limestone hectare, but Duflot gently i
tugs her back--

DUFLOT
{in French}
Suivez-moi, This way...

Duflot guides her back through the brush.. -away from the
hectare, She throws a backwards glance: why does she get the
feeling he’s hiding something?

101 INT. UNCLE HENRY’S BEDROOM - DUSK 101

Django Reinhart'’s “Time on My Hands” spills from the house.

102 EXT. VINEYARD - DUSK 102

Dressed in Henry's best (70’s-era flared pants), Max ambles
through the vines, en route to Duflot's cottage. Along the
way, he plucks some wild roses from the vineyard to make a
clean dozen... His Treo vibrates:

MAX
What's happening, Charlie?

 

CHARLIE (0.8.)
The photos worked like a charm,
mate, Offers are flying in like
crazy. It’s time for me to be on-
site. I booked a flight and should

EXT. DUFLOT'S COTTAGE - EVENING 103

For a peasant, Duflot is doing rather well for himself. His
home is a Provencal hacienda, made of pinkish concrete. In
front is a meticulously landscaped flower garden, and enough
decorative ironwork to open a showroom.

Duflot awaits on his porch, dressed in black trousers, a
black shirt, and a big amile. France’s answer to Johnny
Cash. As Max crosses the front garden -- BLING! -- a gaggle
of plastic swans FLASH ON, lighting Max's path...

DUFLOT
Monsieur Max! Bienvenu! We must
have an apero. Allez, allez... .

And of course, no French greeting is complete without three
kisses on the cheeks. Kias, kiss, kiss.

OMITTED 104 *

INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER 105

And then through the kitchen...where Madame Duflot is hard at
work on dinner...but not so hard at work that she can’t greet
Max with three kissegs--

MADAME DUFLOT
Maxie, Maxie, Maxie...welcome!

Max hands her the roges.

MADAME DUFLOT
Ah, merci! Tres jolie!

EXT. TERRACE - EVENING 106

Finally, Duflot leads Max out to a small tiled terrace, with
a stunning view of the vineyard and the Luberon Valley.
Surprise -- Christie’s here too, standing by the rail,
sipping a Pastis. She looks gorgeous, her hair swept up and
a grown-up dress kissing her body, On a trolley, is a mess
of appetizers, including a thick earthenware terrine of
thrush pate, with the bird's beak protruding from the dark
meat.

eee

 

 
09/19/2005 67.

DUFLOT
I hope you do not mind, I took the
liberty of inviting Henri’s
daughter to join us...

Max is slightly annoyed by how Duflot so easily accepts
Christie as the real thing.

DUFLOT
(moves off)
Un moment. I will get you a
Pastis.

Christie comes over. She’s eating some pate on a cracker.

CHRISTIE
Bonjour cuz.

Kiss, kiss, kiss.

MAX
I see you've managed to ingratiate
yourself with the help.
(re: sexy dress)
Where’d you get the Halston?

CHRISTIE
Dad‘s closet...and actually it’s a
Mary Quant.

MAX

woman who left the dress
behind)

EXT. DINING VERANDA - LATER 107

All are now buzzed from Pastis. Ags Max and Christie sit,
Duflot makes a tour of the table, pouring everyone a glass of
La Siroque wine, while introducing the next phase of dinner.

DUFLOT
A simple meal...after a day's work
in the fields..
(points to each dish)

Caviar d’aubergine... Cold puree
of eggplant... Headless larks...
CHRISTIE

Headless? Where are the heads? We
didn’t, like, eat them already, did
we?

DUFLOT
+..and finally...civet of wild boar
‘a la Provence, marinated in red
wine and blood pressed from the

carcass.

MAX
Why would one have it any other
way?

Duflot tries to pour wine for Papa, but Papa rudely refuses
in an unintelligible language, covering his glass with his
hand, which gets drenched. He abruptly gets up and walks to
the kitchen.

*

 
09/19/2005 69.

MADAME DUFLOT
(Laughing)
Papa only speaks Provencal; the
language of Mistral.

DUFLOT
{ladling the black
casserole into plates)
Very few still understand it. It
is now practiced exclusively by
poets and sodomites.

Papa returns to the table .with.another bottle of red -- Le
Coin Perdu, and a corkscrew. But before he can undo the
cork, Duflot rises as if to scold an idiot child.

DUFLOT
Non, Papa! Non}

PAPA
Le Coin, Le Coin!

Both Max and Christie notice how Duflot fights to stop the
bottle from being opened. But Papa’s a tough old bugger --
and the fight devolves into a wrestling match...

DUFLOT
(struggling and
explaining) .
Le Coin Perdu...a local vin de
garage.

MAX
Vin de garage?

CHRISTIE
(clarifying)
It’s a garage wine. Like a
boutique wine. Small vineyards,
small production, seriously big
prices.

Duflot finally wrests the wine away...as Papa mumbles to
himself.

DUFLOT
It is overrated.

CHRISTIE
It didn’t say that on the Web.
(to Max)
Turns out Le Coin Perdu is a bit of
a Provencal legend.

Tell us Madame Duflot: what is it
that makes you.s@-sure she is
Henry‘’s child?

MADAME DUFLOT
(gesturing)
But of course, the nose.

MAX
Besides that?

An awkward silence as Madame Duflot can’t answer. Christie
is irritated at being discussed like this.

MAX
Come on, there’must be something,
anything -- besides that lovely
snout -- that can help corroborate
her claim...?

{to all)

I mean, did Henry ever discuss
California? Or a woman in
California? Any drunken moments of
candor where he mentioned
offspring? I mean, seriously, the
last person Henry would breed with
is an American.

Duflot shrugs, interrupting.

DUFLOT
(serious observation)
Sadly, in this moment, I see more
of Henry in the girl than I do in
you.

All eyes turn to Christie, who somehow barely maintains her
dignity. Max now openly jealous. She stands, as if about to
make an important announcement, and holds onto the table for
balance.

MAX
Duflot, I looked at the books this

Capital expenditures. Net income.
This place hasn't showed a profit
in a decade -- and it baffles me
how Henry managed to afford
Lamborgini tractors and red
Harley’ s.

to a pre-tax loss of approximately
$23,000 euros a year...for ten
years. Inventive, very.
Believable, no.

Non. My heart will not take this

tomorrow afternoon to present me
with offers. Probably nothing less
than two to three million euros.

word that I'd press the new owners
to accept you as an essential part
of the whole deal. I’m sorry...

places them all into a plastic bag, mashes the grapes with
his hand, and tastes the mushy liquid -- pits, skins and
all... He then scrapes some of the mush into a
Refractometer...which looks like a telescope. He holds the
mush up to the light to analyze it.

JEAN-MARIE
Pas terrible.

JEAN-MARIE

One might as well try to grow
asparagus in the Sahara...

MAX
Looks very well-kept to me...
(points to grapes)
Why are all those grape bunches on
the ground?

JEAN -MARIE
Vendage vert. You cut off two of
every three bunches so what’s left
gets all the nourishment.

MAX
If the land here’s so bad, why go
through all that trouble?

JEAN-MARIE
Perhaps a peasant’s last attempt to
salvage what he could? It is like
taking one’s time while cooking Le
Mac. The end result will always be
Le Mac.

MAX
So then what’s the verdict?

Max drifts back to the bastide, and sees papers and letters
blowing along the ground--

MAX'S POV - AT THE POOL

Christie lying on her stomach on a chaise lounge, suntanning,
fast asleep. Beside her are a few old shoe boxes. She was
going through Henry’s letters, photos, etc... But the breeze
has swept some of them from the boxes. A few are even
floating in the pool...

EXT. POOL - SECONDS LATER 125

Max angrily slaps wet papers onto Christie’s back, waking
her.

MAX
Wakey, wakey, beach Bunny.
(she opens her eyes)
What do you think you’re doing?
That’s Henry’s private stuff.

CHRISTIE
Did you know that Dad mixed a
martini for Winston Churchill?
He also danced a waltz with Amelia
Earhart...in 1975!

Max snaps the diary out of her hand,

EXT. POOL - LATER 126

Max, miserable, is collecting the photos and papers. He
notices a few stray ones have made their way to the pool. He
grabs the skimmer and scoops them up. One of them has
familiar handwriting...his. He spreads the wet letter on the
flat flagstone and reads...

MAX (V.O.)
“Henry. Hope you’re doing your
stretches for another summer of
tennis and rumba. Bad news -- I’m
stuck here at the bank. No
holidays for interns. I got the
watch, Henry. That really wags too
much. 1946 Patek Phillipe. Only.
the best! It certainly puts me way
ahead of the Jones’ around here.
I’ve moved up from being the coffee
boy. My sense of humor is not
appreciated, so I just keep my
mouth shut. I’m going to have to
streamline my attitudes and sharpen
my claws if I’m going to get ahead.
For all the pressure, it’s still a
dark and I’m all-about that. Maybe
next summer? Keep the Cohibas
moist. Max-a-1/4-a million.”

Then, Max comes upon a photo...and double-takes. He looks
clogely: It’s duplicate of Christie’s photo! Shit! He flips
the photo around.

Max looks out the window and sees Charlie standing in the

a double-breasted blazer, pale grey flannels, and a Panama
Hat. .

CHARLIE

“Flower Song” from Carmen.

Uncle Henry appears...and kneels beside to Max.

YOUNG MAX
Why's he singing to them, Uncle
Henry?

UNCLE -HENRY

Max, the terroir needs more than
sun and rain...more even than the
loving hand of a winemaker... It
needs harmony. It needs balance.

Henry stands up and young Max follows. They start to walk
side-by-side,..row by row...

_ HENRY
You see, Max, balance in wine is as
elusive as balance in life... In

life, it requires a heart that can
listen. Notice, Max, the first
four letters of heart are h-e-a-

Xv... Take note: since a balanced
wine can only be produced by a
balanced vine -- it stands to

reason that a balanced life can
only be produced by a balanced man.
It is therefore your charge, boy,
to find that which brings harmony
to your terroir, take hold of it,
and never...ever...let it go...

A massive white and glass space of plasma screen data flow

Sir Nigel. He's on the .pkone, speaking in fluent German.

Completely ignores Max. Max stands there. A power game.

On the wall behind Sir Nigel he sees a Van Gogh of a rolling
Provengal landscape. Exquisite swirls of color and texture.
Sir Nigel hangs up, and peruses some papers without looking
up.

SIR NIGEL
Van Gogh.

MAX
I hope you’ve got a good leck on
the door, Sir.

SIR NIGEL
Don’t be soft. Its not real. Real

Young Max is wading in the pool. Uncle Henry, in swimming
trunks and terry bathrobe, appears above him--

UNCLE HENRY
Max...would you mind entertaining
Ms. Chenal’s daughter while I give
her mother a tour of the estate?

Uncle Henry smiles lasciviously at MS. CHENAL, 40's, who
pushes FANNY, 10, forward to meet Max. Even at this age,
she's gorgeous and a bit dangerous. Max turns red with
typical adolescent embarrassment.

YOUNG MAX
But IT really want to finish the
last chapter of “Death in Venice.”

UNCLE HENRY

Given the book’s title, I don’t
expect you'll be surprised by the
ending, Max.

Max sits on the step, listening to Christie and Duflot in the
middie of a titanic, knock-down, drag-out row in the hall.
They are bellowing in French, holding some vines. They seem
to be fighting over how high, or low, to cut the stems...
Dulfot appears in front of Max--

DUFLOT
Max! Thank God .you are here! I
will not work for this madperson!
Jamais! Jamais!

Duflot steps over to Max, and whispers, conspiratorially:

DUFLOT
But I love this woman!

Duflot storms off as Christie appears and gives him the
finger. Tati barks at Dulfot, and stays with Christie. She
turns to Max--
