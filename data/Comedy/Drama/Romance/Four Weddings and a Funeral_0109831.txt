SPRING
1, INT. CHARLES'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT 'S HOUSE.DAY. 1.

A WEDDING COAT hangs on the door of an old wooden wardrobe.

The wardrobe is in a bedroom. The bedroom is white, and tall.
There is ornate plaster work on the ceiling, but at ground
level, clothes are thrown about on a minimum of furniture.
CHARLES is asleep. His alarm clock goes off. His hand sweeps
up and switches it off. He stays asleep.

2. INT. TOM'S B OOM. TOM & FIONA'S HOUSE. DAY. .

Another alarm clock is ringing - TOM sits bolt upright in his
pyjamas. He is a very high spirited, very affectionate and
very stupid aristocrat. He reaches for a shirt and tie, with
the tie already tied round the neck, and the shirt three-
quarters buttoned - in one movement, he slips them on
together, like a late school boy.

3. INT. KITCHEN. & GARETH'S HOUS DAY. 3.

MATTHEW in a very elegant nightgown, making a pot of tea. He

is 33, clean shaven and very intelligent with a very kind
face.

4. INT. CHARLES'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLET'S HOUSE. DAY. cm

CHARLES is fast asleep.
5. INT. FIONA'S BEDROOM. & FIONA'S HOUSE. DAY. S.

FIONA is tall, attractive, intelligent, aristocratic, 33.
Tom's sister and his utter opposite. She holds up two dresses
- she puts one in front of her and looks in the mirror - pulls
a disapproving face - then holds up the other - pulls a face
at that too - she doesn't like either of them.

6 INT. BEDROOM. TT! & GARETH'S HOUSE. Y. 6.
MATTHEW is buttoning up his detached collar. He wears wedding
trousers, braces, a white shirt. At which moment GARETH
passes behind him. He is about 45 - overweight, bearded, with
rosy cheeks and disposition. At this moment he is wearing
absolutely nothing.

7. INT. CHARLES'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 7.
CHARLES is still asleep.

8. INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR. TOM & FIONA'S HOUS DAY. 8.

TOM now fully dressed in his wedding coat. He emerges from
his bedroom door. Emerging from the door on the opposite side
of the corridor is BERNARD, his best friend, also in his
wedding gear.

It is a rather grand, beautifully decorated big house in Eaton
Square. TOM knocks on FIONA's bedroom door - she wears a
third dress. They're completely ready.

9 ‘LES 'S_ BEDROOM. LES _& SC. ‘S HOUSE.DAY. 9.
CHARLES, rolling over, smiling, still fast asleep.
10. EXT. TTHEW & GAR: 'S HOUSE. DAY. 10.

FIONA, TOM and BERNARD pull up in their car outside Matthew
and Gareth's charming small brick house where MATTHEW and
GARETH are waiting for them. It looks like a little country
cottage but in the middle of a London suburban street. GARETH
points to his watch, implying they're just a little late. He
is now wearing a luscious waistcoat portraying two naked
golden cherubs, kissing across the buttons. Now DAVID walks
coolly down the street towards them: he's about thirty,
slender, very good looking.

11.INT. CHAR: 's B 00) S_& SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY

A car horn blasts in the street and CHARLES.turns, and wakes.
He reaches over sleepily, grabs his alarm clock and looks at
it.
CHARLES
Oo, fuck.

CHARLES is thirty to thirty five, fairly good-looking, fairly
ironic.

. -_S 'T'S BEDROOM. C! S_& SCARLETT HOUSE. DAY. 12.

If you thought Charles's room was untidy, you hadn't seen this
one. It is a massive mess, with pink and orange clothing
everywhere. A scrawny blonde girl, Charles's friend,
SCARLETT, 26, lives there. CHARLES taps her on the shoulder:
she is deeply asleep, and, when woken, confused.

CHARLES picks up her watch, which is pink and by the bed, and
shows it to her. She peeks through sleepy eyes. She's not
from London and not at all upper class.

SCARLETT
Fuck.

13. INT. KITCHEN. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 13.

CU on SCARLETT trying to force a wedge of bread into the
toaster - it is much too large.

SCARLETT
oO fuck.

14.INT. CHARLES'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY.14.
CU CHARLES fingers connecting his braces to the back of his
wedding trousers. He bends to tie his shoes, and the braces
ping off the back of the trousers.

CHARLES
Fuck.

15. EXT. MOTORWAY. TOM & FIONA'S CAR. DAY. 5.
TOM and FIONA's car calmly joining the motorway.

16. INT. KITCHEN. 'S_& SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 16.
SCARLETT, wearing her gold-rim glasses, is now using a big
knife to attack the huge wedged piece of bread in the smoking

SCARLETT
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

i7. EXT. S_& S' "S HOUSE. DAY. 17.

CHARLES & SCARLETT charge out of the front door of their
house. It is a little run down in a beautiful street.
SCARLETT is holding a pink and orange dress, and CHARLES is
holding his tail coat and waistcoat. They run round the
corner, then stop.

CHARLES ©
Did you lock the door?
SCARLETT
No, did you?
PAUSE.
CHARLES
Fuck it.
And they run on.
18. INT/EXT. CHARLES'S CAR. DAY. is.

CHARLES and SCARLETT are sitting in a seedy looking old
Jaguar. The engine chortles - it won't start.
 

CHARLES
Fuck. We'll have to take your car.

SCARLETT
But she only goes 50 miles per hour.

CHARLES raises a "want a bet" eyebrow.

19. T. S' LETT'S CAR. MOTORWAY. DAY. 19.
Scarlett's tiny Mini Cooper 'S' is speeding along the motorway
at a tremendously illegal speed. It is shaking with the
effort.

SCARLETT (V/0O)
(surprised and delighted)
Well, fuck me.

20. SCARLETT'S . MOTORWAY. DAY.

CHARLES
What exit?

SCARLETT faffs a little, picking up the map for the first
time. They shoot past an exit sign.

CHARLES
It better not be 13.

She finds it proudly.

SCARLETT
It's exit 13.

CHARLES
Fuck.

CHARLES jams on the brake. Reverses 50 yards back up the

motorway. Almost dies, then shoots up the sliproad of exit
13.

21. EXT. S' LETT'S MINI. COUNTR' jE. DAY. 21.

An idyllic stretch of summer countryside - suddenly the Mini
shoots into shot and out.

22. Tt. WEDD: 1. COUNTRY CHURCH. DAY. 22.

It is an idyllic sun-soaked small country church, in
Berkshire. Scarlett's mini screeches up, jams on the brakes
and skids into a lay-by 100 yards away. CHARLES and SCARLETT
leap out of the car, and dress in their formal gear. CHARLES
zips up the back of SCARLETT's dress and it catches.

CHARLES
Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck.
 

5

SCARLETT straightens his tie - then holds his shoulder and
looks at him.
SCARLETT
Yes - fuckable.

Over her shoulder a large Rolls Royce appears and shoots past
them. It is the bridal car. They look at each other. Tiny
pause.

CHARLES
Bugger.

They sprint towards the church. THE BRIDE is just getting out
of the car. CHARLES and SCARLETT whip past, with a smile and
a friendly wave.

23. INT. WEDDING 1. UNTRY CHURCH. DAY. 23.

The Church is glowing white and be-decked with flowers.
CHARLES and SCARLETT survey the weddingly scene of hats and
big shoulders. Finally their eyes fall upon their friends,
who we've also been following. They head for them. CHARLES
knows he is late...

FIONA
There is a sort of greatness in your
lateness.

CHARLES

Thanks. I try.

SCARLETT slips in - CHARLES acknowledges them all with a wave
and heads on quickly up the aisle to where the groom is
standing. His name is ANGUS and he's a little tense. He has
a small crafted orange beard.

CHARLES
Christ I'm sorry, Angus.
Inexcusable. I'll be killing myself
after the service, of course.

ANGUS
Doesn't matter - Tom was standing
by...

CHARLES

Thank you, Ton. You're a saint.
And..disastrous haircut.

TOM
Thanks.

TOM gives an enthusiastic thumbs up and heads back down to
join the friends.
 

ANGUS
As long as you haven't forgotten the
rings.

CHARLES
Nope.

CHARLES pats his pocket confidently. When ANGUS looks away we
see a look of concern slip over CHARLES's face - he has just
patted an empty pocket.

At that moment there is a slam of the heavy church doors -
everyone turns around and a GIRL WITH A LARGE BLUE HAT walks
in, and down the aisle. She vaguely uses the hat to shield
herself against curious eyes.

CHARLES
Tssk. I hate people being late.

ANGUS appreciates the effort to relax him and gives Charles a
half smile, and at that moment the Wedding March starts.

CHARLES
Here we go...

ANGUS turns to look down the aisle at his bride. CHARLES
feels his top pocket - no luck there either.

CUT TO:

The Bride, LAURA, on the arm of her father, with two little
and one fully grown bridesmaid, LYDIA. LAURA looks a little
over-fulsome - the row of friends turns as she passes.

SCARLETT
Oo, isn't she lovely!!

FIONA
Scarlett, you're blind. She looks
like a big meringue.

ANGUS smiles at CHARLES to share in the joy at his beautiful
bride. CHARLES smiles back, slightly nervously.

cuT TO:
The Couple as the VICAR starts the service.

VICAR
Dear friends - what a joy it is to
welcome you to our Church on this
wonderful day for Angus and Laura.

CHARLES looks around behind him, trying to find a way out of
his dilemma. His eyes land on the GIRL IN THE BLUE HAT. Her
hair is lit by a ray of light coming through the stained glass
 

7

window. CHARLES can only see part of her face. Then he
remembers: he's got a more important immediate problem.

VICAR
Before we start the wedding service,
let us sing hymn number 135.

They stand - there is a slight wobble on the organ, and a
grinding up to tempo as we hear the intro to "Jerusalem".

GARETH
Great grandmother on the organ.
That's nice.

MATTHEW
Quiet.

cuT INTO:

The singing. CHARLES is trying to attract the attention of
his friends, all in their row. Finally MATTHEW sees him -
CHARLES manages to mime the problem. MATTHEW smacks his head
in mock despair. CHARLES does a little plea. He needs help.

MATTHEW whispers something in GARETH'S ear. GARETH holds out
his hands to reveal no ring. He in turn whispers to FIONA.

CUT THROUGH: Four pairs of ring-less hands.

MATTHEW
(Loud whispering)
Scarlett?

SCARLETT gives him a big innocent smile - she is the last
resort.

VICAR
Dearly beloved - we are gathered
here in the sight of God and in the
face of this congregation...

CHARLES
(To Angus)
Back in a sec...

ANGUS looks alarmed as CHARLES walks right to the side of the
Church. MATTHEW comes to meet him - they stop at THE BLUE HAT
GIRL. MATTHEW does the subtle hand-over, without us seeing
the rings.
VICAR

Therefore if any man can show any

just cause or impediment why they

may not be lawfully joined together,

let them speak now...

CHARLES stops for a second - doesn't want to make any noise
 

and be mistaken for an objector.

CARRIE - THE BLUE HAT GIRL
(To her neighbour)
I suppose the fact he's a terrible
lay doesn't count?

CHARLES hears the comment - now he likes her even more. But
he has to concentrate on the matter in hand.

VICAR
Do you promise to love him, comfort
him, honour and keep him in sickness
and in health, and forsaking all
others, keep thee only unto him, so
long as ye both shall live?

LAURA
(With total love)
I do.

CHARLES slips in comfortably next to Angus.
CUT ON: A little later

. VICAR
Do you have the ring?

THE VICAR moves towards CHARLES, holding open the Bible,
CHARLES takes a little step forward and puts the still unseen
rings on the book. THE VICAR looks slightly surprised.

VICAR
With this ring I thee wed, with my
body I thee worship and with all ny
worldly goods I thee endow..

ANGUS _

With this ring I thee wed, with ny
body I thee worship and with all ny
worldly goods I thee endow..

ANGUS slips the ring on to LAURA'S finger. It is a huge piece
of pink and purple junk jewellery. ANGUS looks startled.
CHARLES plays innocent, and very formal. Then LAURA slips
hers onto ANGUS' hand - it is a skull and cross-bones.

CUT TO:
A 35 year old man with not much hair.

. GEORGE
“If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels but have not love, I
am become a sounding brass, or a
clanging cymbal."
 

GARETH
Good point.

CUT TO:

A couple (CLAUDIA & CRAIG) with an acoustic guitar playing
John Denver's classic hit "Annie's Song". It isa sister and
her boyfriend filling in while the couple sign the register.

CLAUDIA & CRAIG .
“you fill up my senses like a night
in a forest..."

GARETH has his head in his hands in despair. A baby starts to
talk.

GARETH
(Raising his head)
oO, bravo.

FIONA

This is the sort of song that makes
you cry, isn't it, Scarlett?

SCARLETT
(In tears)
Is it?

CUT TO:

The newly-weds leave the Church, the Toccata plays and babies
cry in harmony. CHARLES stands at the door as the guests
leave. Everyone knows him. CARRIE passes...

. CHARLES
Great hat.

CARRIE _
Thanks - I bought it specially...

She moves on, with a slightly wry smile. She's American. He
likes her.

24. EXT. NG _ 1. COUNTRY CHURCH. _D. 24.

The wedding photos are being taken. Six quick stills of the
family. In the course of the shots a 6 YEAR OLD BOY goes
under the skirt of LAURA and emerges smiling. Then is hit.

Meanwhile, CHARLES'S friends gather on the sidelines, a real
group, comfortable: MATTHEW, GARETH, FIONA, SCARLETT, TOM,
BERNARD, DAVID. As CHARLES approaches he speaks to DAVID in
sign - DAVID is his brother - and deaf. (NOTE: all underlined
lines of dialoque will appear on the screen as subtitles)
 

CHARLES
Same old stiffs
DAVID

Yes - how did we get stuck with this
shower _as lifelong friends?

CHARLES
You're lucky, you don't have to talk
to them. (He turns) Fiona - you're
looking fucking beautiful - I
couldn't tell you earlier in
Church, because of the ‘'fucking'

bit.
FIONA
Thank you Charles.
kkRE
TOM
Splendid, I thought, what did you
think?
BERNARD
I thought splendid.
kkek
CHARLES
Any idea who that girl in the blue

hat is?

They look across at CARRIE who is listening considerately to
a grandmother.

FIONA
Name's Carrie.

CHARLES
Pretty.

FIONA
American.

CHARLES
Interesting.

FIONA
Slut.

CHARLES

Really?
 

11

FIONA
Used to work at Vogue. Lives in
America now - only goes out with
very glamorous people - out of your
league.

CHARLES
That's a relief.

He sees CARRIE walking away from the Church. She removes her
exotic blue hat and casually throws it into a dustbin. She
then leans over, slips off her dark blue tights and throws
them away too. She walks on - CHARLES watches her go.

GARETH
Right - reception?

They all turn to go.

25. XT. UNTRY DAY. :
The guests are heading down a lane away from the church
towards a huge barn. There is a lovely, rural feeling to
everything, as though the wedding is a harvest festival.

There are pink bows on the sheep they pass. They chat as they
walk.

TOM
Anyone else tread in a cowpat? No -
thought not - see you in a mo.
Don't want to blow my chances for
romance by smelling of dung all the
way through the reception.

FIONA
Do you think I'd hate him as much if
he wasn't my brother? God. I never
know what to say in these wretched
line-ups. .

GARETH
0, it's a cinch - just say the bride
looked beautiful and isn't it a
lovely day.

To the side, we see TOM rub his foot violently against a bale
of hay. Then another bale gently topples onto him.

FIONA
We can't do better than that?

MATTHEW
Traditionally, no. Unless you want
to try "you must be very proud".
 

12
26. NT. BARN. RECEPTION LINE. DAY. 26.

Wife LAURA is hugely gushy, laughy, hugging everyone. Husband
ANGUS is smiling, which is unusual for him. Then there are
the FOUR PARENTS. At the end stand various sisters, brothers
and bridesmaids.

FIONA
(So sincerely)
You must be very proud.

TOM
(Slightly hay-covered)
Hello.

GARETH and MATTHEW just arriving at the PARENTS' end of the
line.

GARETH
Quite superb - it's made Matthew and
I think quite seriously about the
possibility of getting married.

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Really? And which are the lucky
young ladies?

GARETH is about to explain that isn't exactly what he means
when MATTHEW interrupts.

MATTHEW
Unfortunately they were busy.

GARETH
Yes, the life of the air hostess is
not an easy one.

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE is a little over made-up

CHARLES
(Whispered to Scarlett)
Clothes by Coco Chanel, make-up by
Caco the Clown.

CHARLES now reaches THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE and is as charming
as possible.

CHARLES (cont)
She was very beautiful - although
perhaps not as lovely as her
mother...

MOTHER blushes happily and introduces him to CLAUDIA, the John
Denver singer.
 

13
MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
Why thank you - this is Claudia:
she's done all the catering.

CHARLES shakes the hand of the over-excited Claudia.

CHARLES
Excellent. If it's anything like
your music, we've really got

something to look forward to.
SCARLETT is just behind.

SCARLETT
I thought she looked unbe-fucking-
lievably pretty didn't you?

MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
Ah, yes.

SCARLETT
I'm surprised your son just didn't
give her one on the spot, there and
then.

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Well, quite.

SCARLETT has no real sense of what is the right or the wrong
thing to say at any given time.

7. NT. _B; . ‘CEPTION. DAY. 27.

The barn is decked out with beams and flowers and ribbons -
full of tables, with a long table at the end on a slightly
raised dais. Expensive, but with a nice homey feeling to it.
The family are upper middle class: there are lots of guests
wearing dark suits, not wedding coats - and there are lots of
flower pattern dresses.

Throughout the reception, the background action is full of the
business of weddings: pairs of old people standing saying
nothing - old person taiking to young person and yawning -
people burning fingers on little sausages - children fighting
and pulling table cloths and skirts down.

CUT To:
OUR GROUP, in their wedding coats and frocks, ready for the

fray ~ a wedding Magnificent Seven (actually 8). They stand
by a large, proud flower arrangement. .
14

MATTHEW
Right - synchronise watches - we
meet back here in, shall we say - 6
hours time. Who's going to drive -
i.e not drink?

GARETH
Heads it's not one of us 5. Tails
it's Tom.
He spins a coin.

GARETH (cont)
It's Tom.

TOM
Ah well, can't win'em all.

He doesn't sense there might be a trick.

' GARETH
Right - let's mingle. And remember
- be careful - it's a jungle out

: there.

They all spread out through the party, like 8 errant knights.

CHARLES
| You ing?
DAVID
No, I'll hang out looking enigmatic.
CHARLES
Please yourself - I'm a _m wil a

mission.

CHARLES winds through people looking out for CARRIE - standing
on his toes he sees her, grabs a glass, and moves towards her
- but at the last moment, another man joins her.

CHARLES
Damn.

GARETH
Is that for me?

Reaching for the spare glass.

CHARLES
If you like.

GARETH
Thanks. I've spotted an ex. I'm
going to be so amusing, ten minutes
from now he will die of regret.

 
 

15

CHARLES spies CARRIE, but again she is headed off by another
good~looker - she is clearly much feted by men.

CHARLES
Bastard.

CHARLES heads for the drinks table to stock up again, by the
time he turns, she's alone again. He makes it to her, with a
few rushed 'Hellos' on the way.

CHARLES
Hello - wine?

CARRIE
Thank you.

CHARLES

Just as he's searching for what to say, an acquaintance,
glimpsed in the Church, slips into shot: he's rather a stiff,
38 going on 60, stockbroker.

JOHN
Hello, Charles.

CHARLES
Hello John - this is...sorry, I
don't know your...

CARRIE
Carrie.

JOHN
Delighted, I'm John.

Tiny pause - who's to talk?

CHARLES ©
So tell me John - how's’ your
gorgeous girlfriend?

JOHN
She is no longer my girlfriend.

CHARLES
O dear - still, don't be too gloomy
- rumour has it she never stopped
shagging old Toby de Lisle, just in
case you didn't work out.

JOHN
She is now my wife.

CHARLES
Excelient. Excellent.
 

16

CARRIE takes in totally that this is the most embarrassing
Moment and leaves them to it, amused.

CARRIE
Excuse me.

She leaves them. Tiny pause.

CHARLES
Ahm...any children or anything?

CARRIE moves away - she helps herself to a drink. She looks
around and there in the corner, sees CHARLES deliberately hit
his head against the wall, once.

When he stands straight again, an old lady passes his line of
vision. He clearly knows her, and smiles politely.

CHARLES
Hello, lovely to see you.

cUT TO:

FIONA nearby, talking to an innocent looking fellow, with a
pudding basin hair cut.

FIONA
The thing I love about weddings is
the crying children. They recruit
each other in creches: "I'll take
the sermon - could you fuck up the
vows" What do you do?

GERALD
I'm training to be a priest.

FIONA —
Good Lord. Do you do weddings?

GERALD
Not yet - I will though, of course -
damn nerve-racking.

FIONA
Like the first time you have sex.

GERALD
Well, I suppose so...
FIONA

Though less messy, of course...and
far less call for condoms.
 

17

GERALD
(Embarrassed) Aaahm...

He chokes a little on his canape.
cUT TO:
CHARLES still shaking his head, face to the wall.

DAVID
How_ are you doing?

CHARLES
Remember that time I was helping Dad
get the boat in, and you switched on
the motor and ie propeller cu’

leq to shreds?

DAVID
Yes.

CHARLES
Things are worse.

CUT TO:

A PRETTY RED HAIRED GIRL who has been watching them - she
stands next to MATTHEW.

SERENA
Who's that boy over there?
MATTHEW
His name's David.
SERENA
He's something of a dish, isn't he?
MATTHEW ©
I've always thought so.
' SERENA
Why were they...? (mimes signing)
MATTHEW
The dishy one can't hear.
SERENA
0. Gosh.
MATTHEW

Silent, but deadly attractive.

A bang on the table.
 

. 18

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Ladies and gentlemen - dinner is
served.

A quick shot from above shows people moving around and to
tables.

CUT ROUND:

The friends: they sit down at their different tables. All
have quite pleasant companions.

MATTHEW
Hello, I'm Matthew. And this is
David - he's deaf, which means he
reads lips and understands
everything you say.

DAVID raises his hand politely - 'Hi'.

EEK
TOM
Tom - splendid to meet you - very
exciting.
kkkK
GARETH

Hello, I'm Gareth. I've .got an
instant feeling we're going to be
friends for life.

kekK

SCARLETT
Hello, I'm Scarlett (She gives the
total stranger a kiss on the mouth).
Warn me if I'm getting pissed, will
you?

keRK

CARRIE sits down between two good looking boys. CHARLES is
watching her - a little fed up. He glides into his position
on the long, raised-up top table and introduces himself to the
very old indeed MAN, next to him.

CHARLES
How do you do - my name is Charles.

OLD MAN
Don't be ridiculous, Charles died 20
years ago.
19

The food is put down in front of him. It does not look
appetising - the sister strikes.

cut TO:

Wide shot of the eating arrangements. Along from CHARLES are
the Bride LAURA and Groom ANGUS, between parents in law,
uncles and vicars. Knives and forks going into mouths.
Everyone looking unhappy.

WAITER
More?

MAN 1
No thank you.

CHARLES is watching CARRIE and listening to the OLD MAN...
The camera lingers on CARRIE while the OLD MAN talks.

OLD MAN (V/0)

I was married once myself, you know
- beautiful girl - eyes like a blue
sky, hair like wheat, cheeks like a
soft peach -

CUT BACK:
To OLD MAN
: OLD: MAN (cont)
- brain like a small pea,

unfortunately, so it didn't last.

CHARLES
oO, I am sorry.

CHARLES takes a bite of food - not tasty. All round the bites
of the grisly-looking food get smaller and smaller. The
waiters still however have to do their rounds.

WAITRESS
More?
WOMAN 1
No thank you.
WAITRESS
More?
GARETH
I would rather eat my father's
testicles.
WAITER

More?
 

20

TOM
Absolutely. Splendid tuck.

Sound of a banging spoon: CHARLES stands. He speaks in a very
self-effacing manner.

CHARLES
Ladies and gentlemen - I'm sorry to
drag you from your delicious
desserts: there are just one or two
little things I feel I should say as
best man.

The guests turn to listen to him.

Before I start my speech, can I just
say this - I am, as ever, in
bewildered awe of any couple who
make the commitment that Angus and

Laura have made this morning. True
love is a very rare and splendid
thing - and I think we see it here
today.

ANGUS and LAURA are touched.

This is only the second time I've
ever been a best man. I hope I did
the job all right that time - the
couple in question at least are
still talking to me. Unfortunately,
they're not talking to each other -
the divorce came through a couple of
months ago.

CUT TO:
CARRIE laughing brightly - then back to CHARLES.

CHARLES (cont)

But I'm assured it had absolutely
nothing to do with me. Apparently
Belinda knew that Anthony had slept
with her younger sister before I
mentioned it in the speech. The
fact that he'd also slept with her
mother came as a surprise - but I
think it was incidental to the
nightmare of violence and
recrimination which became their two
week marriage. Anyway - enough of
that. Angus has asked me to talk a
little bit about his...romantic
past.
221

Laughter. CHARLES looks back to where CARRIE was - but she's
gone.

CUT ON TO:

CHARLES (cont)
Ladies and gentlemen - the adorable
couple.

ALL stand to toast.

ALL
The adorable couple!

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Thank you Charles. Now please,
everyone, do just enjoy yourselves -
we trust there will be dancing till
dawn. Twist away!

CHARLES turns to the OLD MAN.

CHARLES
Catch you for a bop later.

He sets off purposefully.
CUT TO:

The slightly dodgy Rock'N'Roll band starting 'Semi-detached
Suburban Mr Jones':

"So you finally named the day wedding bells will chime. I was
sorry to hear you say, they're going to be his, not mine"

The newly-weds, LAURA and ANGUS, come out and dance. Everyone
applauds. She dances rather exotically, he as though this is
the first time he has ever heard pop music.

SCARLETT
Come on Charles - give us a dance -
no other bugger will.

CHARLES
Try Tom.

SCARLETT
Okay.

CHARLES is clearly looking for CARRIE - but then there she is
on the dance floor with one of her dinner companions.

CHARLES
Damn.
 

. / 22

SCARLETT starts dancing wildly but enthusiastically with TOM,
the worst dancer in the world but the keenest.

Beside them is GARETH twisting with great vigour with a 50
year old lady.

CHARLES sits down and looks back at CARRIE and her man,
dancing quite close. MATTHEW sits down beside him. As they
talk, we intercut with the dance floor.

MATTHEW
I remember the first time I saw
Gareth on the dance floor, I feared
lives would be lost.

GARETH now doing a Saturday Night Fever style dance.

MATTHEW (cont)
But actually he's surprisingly safe.

SCARLETT is now dancing very badly indeed. Beside her is a
ten year old boy really getting down, then joined by GARETH,
doing exactly the same Hi-energy dance. Beside them is
CARRIE.

MATTHEW
Pretty girl, the one you can't keep
your eyes off. Is it love at first
sight?

CHARLES is slightly thrown by Matthew's perception.

CHARLES
Good lord no - it's the bloke she's
dancing with - I'm sure I played
rugby with him at school - trying to
remember which position he played.

GARETH is now doing the bump with a hefty grandmother.
Bump!

CHARLES (cont)

Though, let's say one did take a
fancy to someone at a wedding: do
you think there really are people

who can just go up and say - "Hi -
I'm Charles - this’ is your lucky
night"?
MATTHEW
If there are, they're not English.
CHARLES
Quite - 3 weeks is about my

question-popping mininun.
23

CUT TO: LATER THAT NIGHT

LAURA, near an exit - emotionally talking to and hugging some
distant cousins: another hour or two have passed. She's in
her about-to-leave gear.

LAURA
You know I love you, Jean, don't
you. I love you, I love you, I love
you and Mike, I don't know you very
well, but I love you very much, I
really do.

ANGUS remarks to MATTHEW who stands next to him.

ANGUS
Ignore her - she's drunk. (pause)
At least I hope_ she's~= drunk.
(worried pause) Otherwise I'm in
real trouble.

In the corners of the room people are a little tired and
emotional.

CUT TO:
BERNARD speaking to the fulsome bridesmaid LYDIA.
BERNARD
How's it going, Lyds?
LYDIA
Bloody awful.
BERNARD
O dear.
LYDIA

I was promised sex - everyone said
it - "You be a bridesmaid, you'll
get sex. You'll be fighting them
off". But not so much as tongue in
sight - the amount I paid for this
dress - and zero. Zilch. Doodle

squat.

BERNARD
Well, look - I mean, if you
fancy...or anything, IT could
always...

LYDIA
O don't be ridiculous - I'm not that
desperate.

She gets up and goes.
———

 

 

24

BERNARD
No, right, fair enough, good point.

General clapping as the couple head out: the bride throws her
bouquet. SCARLETT reaches for it, FIONA dodges it - it is
caught by LYDIA.

28. EXT. BARN. NIGH' 28.

The married couple approach a Rolls Royce with a string of
cans attached to it - and ‘Just Married' and '3 Months
pregnant' in fake snow on the windscreen. They open the door,
and a big white sheep with a bow on jumps out, accompanied by
chickens - a roar of delight.

-CUT TO:

A big cheer as they drive away. CHARLES sees CARRIE walk away
with aman. As he heads disconsolately back into the barn...

29. INT. .~ NIGHT. 29.

TOM joins CHARLES keenly.

TOM
Where are you staying tonight,
Charles?
CHARLES

Scarlett and I are at some pub - The
Lucky Boat or something. Aren't we
all?

TOM
Ah-no- slight change of plan - the
others are in fact coming back to my
place: I wondered if you'd like to
join.
CHARLES

Well, no, that sounds lovely - is
there room for Scarlett too?

TOM
O absolutely. 137 rooms actually.

CHARLES
Tom - are you the richest man in
England?
25

TOM .
Oh - no, no. I believe we're about
7th. The Queen obviously, and that
Branson bloke is doing terribly
well. Well, excellent news - I'll
go tell Scarlett.

As TOM walks away

CHARLES
(Not hopeful)
That's unless I get lucky.

TOM
(Hopeful)
Absolutely! !

And suddenly, CARRIE is right at his shoulder.

' CARRIE
Hi.

CHARLES is taken aback.

CHARLES
1 I thought you'd gone.

CARRIE
No - not yet. I was just wondering
- where you were staying tonight?

CHARLES
Well, I was going to stay at a pub,
the Happy Boat, or something...

f CARRIE
The Lucky Boatman.

CHARLES
That's right. But now I'm going to
stay at some friend's house...with
some friends. Well, I say 'house' —-
I think 'enormous castle' is a more
accurate description.

CARRIE
0, that's a pity. I'm at the
Boatman.

CHARLES
oO.

PAUSE.

She doesn't give CHARLES quite enough time to recover.
It's quite a direct invitation.

 
 

26

CARRIE
Well, it was really nice not quite
meeting you. I'm going now.

CHARLES
O,no, you mustn't - we could meet
now ~ the evening's just getting

going.

They survey the fallen-bottle, toppled-chair mess.

CARRIE
I think we both know that's a big
lie.
She walks away.
CHARLES
Fuck.
LATER: The camera pans over the proceedings - the sister and
her boyfriend are back with 'Stand by Your Man'. Two
exhausted hugging couples are still on the dance floor, trying
to dance to it. Couples are kissing. Drunk people are
asleep.

CLAUDIA AND CRAIG
"You'll have bad times,
he'll have good times.
Doing things that you don't”
understand."

The Friends are back at the spot where they swore to meet 6
hours earlier. The flower arrangement has wilted.

GARETH
I think the Castle beckons. Ton,
are you sober?

TOM
Absolutely.

TOM gives a thumbs up and then trips as they walk out, jackets
slung over their shoulders: CHARLES, TOM, GARETH, MATTHEW,
DAVID, FIONA picking up an exhausted SCARLETT as they go.
They pass a couple kissing passionately. Hold on them: they
split: It's LYDIA and BERNARD whom she so recently spurned.
She's quite breathless.

LYDIA
Bernard!
 

27
30. EXT. CAR. COUNTRY LANE. NIGHT. 30.

Wide beautiful shot of the countryside and a small car winding
down a country lane. From it ring the strains of STAND BY
YOUR MAN.

ALL
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to

GARETH
(almighty bass solo)
When nights are sad and lonely...

31. INT. CAR. CO! ._NIG! 3

MATTHEW, SCARLETT, GARETH, TOM, DAVID, CHARLES and FIONA all
squeezed in together. All yelling except Charles, who is
looking worried. .

ALL
Stand by your man
And say you love him only
And give him all the love you can
(Big trouble with the top note)
STAND BY YOUR MAN!I!!!

CHARLES
Ahm, Tom, could you stop the car.

The car stops dead.

CHARLES (cont)
You know, I think I might just stay
in that hotel after all.

TOM
Why on earth?

CHARLES
I'll tell you years from now.

ALL of them make a teasing Police siren sound.

CHARLES (cont)
No seriously, I'm doing some
research into pubs with the word
‘boat' in the title. I hope to
produce the definitive work.
 

28
32. EXT. CAR. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. 32.

CHARLES is standing in the middle of the road, in the middle
of the night in the middle of nowhere.

As the car drives away - they start to shout the chorus of
‘Without You'.

ALL
Can't liiiiive if living is without
you
Can't giiiive, can't give any
more!!!

CHARLES is left totally alone.

CHARLES
Right. Odd decision.

He heads back along the road.
33. EXT. TOWN UARE. NIGHT. 33.

A charming town square. The Boatman is a pleasant, large pub
hotel, white, with an archway through which cars can drive and
park at the back. The name of the Hotel is on big carved gold
letters outside. CHARLES enters.

The sign shows the lucky boatman getting a blowjob from a
mermaid, while his friends are being eaten -by sharks.

34. INT. RECEPTION. ATMAN. NIGHT 34.

It is now about one in the morning. Very quiet. CHARLES sees
the bell to ring on the front desk, but just before he does so
looks left, and sees a plume of smoke rising from a large
leather armchair in the sitting room next door. CHARLES walks
towards it.

CHARLES
Hello?

CARRIE leans over - and looks at him quizzically.
CHARLES

In the end it turned out there
wasn't room for all of us.

CARRIE
You said it was a castle.
CHARLES
Yes, that's right. Very small

castle. Tiny. Pocket size. One up,
one down.
29
Enter a late night waiter.

WAITER
A drink, sir?

CHARLES
I'll have a glass of port, thank
you. You?

CARRIE
I'll have a glass of port too,
thanks.

CHARLES turns to the waiter

CHARLES
And another one for the lady.

WAITER
Sir.

WAITER leaves and CHARLES turns back to address CARRIE - but
she's disappeared. It's clear why, when GEORGE enters, the
confident balding, plump, annoying man who read the lesson in

Church.
GEORGE :
You haven't seen Carrie have you?
: - CHARLES
(In a fluster)
Who?
GEORGE
Carrie. American girl. Lovely

legs. Wedding guest. Nice smell.

CHARLES
i Sorry - no.

GEORGE
Blast. I think I was in there.

CARRIE pops up from behind the sofa and pulls a face - he very
clearly was not ‘in there'.

GEORGE (cont)
Look, if you see her, could you tell
her I've gone to my roon.

CHARLES
Certainly. Dear fellow.

WAITER comes in, just as GEORGE is about to leave.

 
 

WAITER
Your port Sir, and one for the...

CHARLES
...road, excellent.

GEORGE
Actually, I might have one of those.
Mind if I join you?

CHARLES
Ahm...no, no, go ahead.

GEORGE
(to the waiter)
Another port, thanks. And a cigar
(To Charles) Might as well settle
in. Let's see if we can get through
till dawn, shall we, eh?

They settle, CHARLES in the chair, GEORGE on the sofa. CARRIE
raises from behind the sofa and looks humorously exasperated
at CHARLES .

GEORGE
Lovely wedding

CHARLES
Yes.

CARRIE appears behind GEORGE, crawling towards the door.

GEORGE
I was at school with his brother
Bufty - tremendous bloke. I was his
fag. Buggered me senseless, but it
taught me a thing or two about life.

Reaction off CHARLES. Meanwhile CARRIE, on her knees, is
almost at the door. The WAITER comes in again. She makes a
‘shush' sign at him, and beckons him to follow her.

GEORGE
Where do you know them from?

CHARLES
University.

He sees CARRIE now talking to the WAITER outside the room.
 

31

GEORGE
O splendid, splendid. Yes. Didn't
go myself...couldn't see the point.
When you're working the money
markets, what use are the novels of
Wordsworth going to be, eh?

CHARLES
Good point. Shakespeare's short
stories equally pointless.

WAITER re-enters formally.

WAITER
Excuse me, sir - your wife says,
could you come upstairs at once.
Room 12 in case you're so drunk you
can't remember.

CHARLES
My wife?

WAITER
Yes sir.

CHARLES

O dear - yes - my wife.

GEORGE
You are drunk if you can't even
remember you've got a wife!!

CHARLES
Yes... (does a little drunk mime -
then, excusing himself) Do you mind,
if I...? (points upstairs)

GEORGE
O no - off you go - best of luck.
Lucky bachelor me, think I might
have another search for that Katie
creature.

CHARLES
Carrie.

GEORGE
That's right. Damn fine filly.

35. INT. CORRIDOR. THE BOATMAN. NIGHT. 35.

 

CHARLES knocks on the door of room 12. CARRIE opens it.
CHARLES is slightly nervous.

CARRIE
Hi.
 

36.

NT. ROO!

CHARLES
Hello. Sorry about that...

CARRIE
No, that's fine - he was hard to get
rid of. (Pause) It's a sad day when
a girl's got to ask a boy up to her
bedroom to get any privacy.

CHARLES
Yes - perhaps we could skulk around
here and then go back down.

CARRIE
That's a thought - I don't usually
skulk a lot, but I suppose I could
skulk if skulking was required. Do
you skulk regularly?

CHARLES
No, I don't normally think of myself
as a skulker.

CARRIE
Okay, so just come in, and skulk for
a while, and we'll see...

2. THE BOATMAN. NIGHT.

CARRIE
I noticed the bride and groom didn't
kiss.

CHARLES
No - it doesn't always happen. "You
may now kiss the bride" isn't
actually in the Book of Common
Prayer.

CARRIE
I always worry that I'd go too far.

CHARLES
How far do you think too far would
be?

CARRIE
I dont' know...I think.. (gives him
a peck on the cheek) that...would be
all right.

CHARLES
oO yes - I think so. In fact, it
might be thought a
little...dismissive...

32

36.
33

CARRIE
Maybe. Maybe this... (a kiss on the
mouth) would be better.

CHARLES
Yes. You wouldn't want to take it
any further. I mean...(a long kiss)
That might be taking it a little
far. And...

This becomes a voice over, as we pan across her bedroom.

CHARLES
....what about this - do you think
the vicar would think things had
slipped a little out of his control?

They are naked and making love on the bed.

CARRIE
I think he might...I'd be very
surprised if we weren't enjoying
ourselves more than the honeymoon
couple.

CHARLES
I'm sure we are.

. CARRIE
Why do you think it was called a
honeymoon?

CHARLES
I'm not sure - I suppose '‘honey'
because it's as sweet as honey - and
‘moon' because it was the first time
a husband saw his wife's bottom.

She laughs - for all his early unsureness, she makes hin
relaxed, by being so totally relaxed herself.

37. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY. 37.

The beautiful landscape outside waking up in the dawn, birds,
dew, a stream.

8. INT. ROOM 12. THE BOATMAN. DAY. 38.

We see the edge of the bed, knee level, CARRIE's legs. Her
hand reaches down and picks up her dress. Then her shoes. We
move round to see CHARLES still fast asleep. He slowly wakes,
opens his eyes and looks up. Again, her face is caught in
beautiful light.

CHARLES
What's happening?
 

34

CARRIE
I've got to go.

CHARLES
Where to?

CARRIE
America.

CHARLES

When are you going?

CARRIE
Three hours.

CHARLES
That is a tragedy.

He flops his head onto the pillow.

CARRIE
Just before I go - when are you
thinking of making the announcement?

CHARLES
What announcement?

CARRIE
The engagement.

CHARLES
Whose engagement?

CARRIE
Ours. I assumed since we'd slept
together and everything, weld
probably get married. What were you
thinking?

CHARLES
Ah, gosh, look, this sort of thing
takes a lot of thought, I obviously
ahm...

Then he suddenly sees she's smiling.

She nods.

CHARLES (cont)
You're joking?

CHARLES (cont)
God for a second there I thought you
were Glenn Close - I thought I was
going to get home and find a rabbit
on the stove.
35

CARRIE
No - but I think you just missed a
great opportunity. Bye Bye.

She winks and is gone. He turns over, sinks his head into his
pillow, and then the alarm clock goes off again.

 

 
36

SUMMER

39.INT. CHARLES' BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT! jOUSE. 39.

It is bright daylight - the alarm clock is ringing. Finally
CHARLES's hand comes up and switches it off. He takes it and
brings it down to his eyes to see. He opens them, them looks
at the clock.

CHARLES
O fuck.
CAPTION: 3 MONTHS LATER
40.INT. SCARLETT'S BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. 40.

The door of Scarlett's room: It is kicked open. CHARLES
grabs SCARLETT's shoulder, her profoundly mascara'd eyes open:
CHARLES is clearly not happy.

SCARLETT
oO fuck.

41. . KITCHEN. & LETT 'S_HO! . DAY. 1.

CHARLES and SCARLETT in their pants only - both frantic.
CHARLES helping himself to orange juice. SCARLETT buttering
an incredibly burnt piece of toast - the atmosphere is heavy
with smoke.

; SCARLETT
All very well for you - I'm a
blooming bridesmaid.

CHARLES

Don't worry - it's not far. Seven

minutes should be loads of time.
42. EXT. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 42.
The two of them sprint out - still dressing. SCARLETT is
pulling on a huge and ridiculous peach-coloured satin off the
shoulder number.
CAPTION: 6 MINUTES LATER

SCARLETT
Car or taxi?

CHARLES
Taxi. We could never park.
en

 

/ 37
43. EXT. PAVEMENT. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 43.

 

The two of them standing on the sidewalk, stock still.
Nothing is coming along the road. Pause.

BOTH
(simultaneously)
Car seems a good idea.
CUT TO:
Them at her car. It is clamped.

BOTH
Fuck.

44. EXT. REGENT'S PARK. . 44.
TWO JOGGERS are pacing each other, going fast - then, in full
wedding gear, CHARLES & SCARLETT whip past them, her dress
ballooning in the wind. In fact, a huge piece falls away.
They stop. PAUSE. .

SCARLETT
Don't worry - no one will notice.

They hit the street ~ PAUSE for breath. At that moment, a
large Church bell rings 11 O'clock.

SCARLETT
O shut up!

They sprint along. The two of them are going full pelt, when

avery grand car draws up with them, slowly. The window rolls
down.

VOICE
Come on, hurry up you two!

CHARLES
Fu...0, hello Lydia.

It is the bridal car.
SCARLETT

0, you couldn't give us a lift could
you, Lyd?

LYDIA
No need - we're here.

They turn the corner, and there in front of them is a glorious
shining beautiful Catholic London Church.
CHARLES
Thank the Lord (kisses Scarlett)
Good luck, don't trip up and show
everyone your botton.

45. INT. WEDDING 2. CATHOLIC C CH. DAY. 45.

In one row are FIONA, MATTHEW, GARETH, DAVID. They've politely
left a space for CHARLES. An OLD MAN heads up the aisle:
CHARLES walks quickly after him...but it ain't fast enough.
The OLD MAN just reaches the seat one second before CHARLES.

CHARLES
F...Damn.

He looks around, sees a spare place and moves swiftly into it.
At last he has a moment of rest. Then, from beside him, a
voice...

CARRIE
Hi.

CHARLES looks round, and there she is siting right next to
hin.

: CHARLES
O. Hello. Welcome back. No hat.

; CARRIE
No. You cut it fine.

CHARLES
Yes, I'm a big idiot.

CHARLES settles himself and then looks back at CARRIE and
smiles at her - he's going to enjoy her company.

CHARLES
Do you live here now?

CARRIE
I'm just moving back.

CHARLES
Wonderful news.

Up at the front, the young priest steps forward into position
to conduct the service. It is FATHER GERALD from the last
reception. He looks a little tense. His cape is slightly
awkwardly slung over his shoulders - it's a little tangled.
He seems to be rehearsing the service to himself.

cut To:

TOM, up in position as Best Man - he turns and gives CHARLES
a little wave. Produces a ring from his pocket - gives
39

CHARLES a thumbs up. CHARLES smiles back. TOM points to his
radical new haircut. CHARLES gives a glazed smile and a nod -
he doesn't want to break TOM's confidence. TOM is delighted -
double thumbs up. Music begins.

cut To:

The Bride walking down the aisle to Handel's ‘Arrival of the
Queen of Sheba'. It is LYDIA who kissed Bernard at the end of
the last wedding. She wears a big dress. Behind are three
tiny satin peach bridesmaids and SCARLETT - SCARLETT wears a
huge smile. It is noticeable as she passes that her dress has
no back, and you can just see the top of her bottom. The page
boys follow, unruly as usual, wandering all over the shop.

CARRIE
Why do page boys always look like
they're on drugs?

CHARLES
They are - the priest gives them a
tab of Ecstasy to get them in the
mood.

LYDIA arrives at the front - THE FATHER steps aside- BERNARD
the groom steps forward. He grins wildly.

FATHER GERALD
In the name of the Father and of The
‘Son and of The Holy Spirit.

ALL
Amen.

FATHER GERALD

Let us pray. Father - you have made
the bond of marriage a holy misery,
mystery, a symbol of Christ's love
for his Church. Hear our prayers
for Bernard and Lydia, through our
son, Jesus Christ, your Lord -
sorry, your son Jesus Christ our
lord, who lives and reigns with you
and.the Holy Goose, Ghost, one God
for ever and ever. Amen.

CARRIE
It's his first time. Friend of the
family.
CHARLES
Oo.
CHARLES looks around - all his friends have noticed the
problem - they give a unison thumbs up to him - they're

enjoying it.

ALL
Amen.

FATHER GERALD
Go in peace to love and save the
Lord, sorry, serve hin.

ALL

GARETH starts to applaud, thrilled they've made it through.
The whole congregation joins in.

FATHER GERALD
We will now have the signing of the

register.
46.INT. WEDDING 2. CATHOLIC CHURCH. REGISTRY ROOM. DAY. 46.

They move into a small room - we see FATHER GERALD reach into
his pocket and remove a pen for the signing.

47. INT. DDING 2. CATHOLIC C! C. Y. .
Five minutes later the couple are walking down the aisle -
accompanied by perky organ playing. LYDIA's dress is totally
covered in ink from FATHER GERALD's pen.

As the newly weds leave the Church, the usual sudden surge of
chatter. There is a new bond forged between CHARLES and
CARRIE because of the disasters during the service. We
suspect things are going to go very well between them.

CHARLES
I thought you'd gone to America. We
could've been married by now if
you'd just rung me.

She turns to the man beside her. He's 50 - older - silver
haired - respectable, inaccessible.

CARRIE
This is my fiancee: Hamish.
 

43

CHARLES doesn't register a moment's hesitation or
embarrassment, despite the fact that this is a bad moment -his
hopes had risen high.

CHARLES
Excellent - how do you do, Hamish -
delighted to meet you. What a

charming surprise to find Carrie
back in the country.

HAMISH
Yes, well, she took some persuading.
Come on darling, let's not actually
be the last people out of the
Church.

CARRIE
Okay (turns to Charles and pulls a
face) Bossy!

But then goes off happily.
48. . WEDDING 2. CATHOLIC CHURCH. _D. 48.

A series of snapshots of the happy couple. First just then,
then plus 6 others, then plus 14, then 150 people, the hugest
group of relatives ever. Tom is right in there, organising
it. Then a final snap just of the happy pair - except there
is one collapsed Grandmother just at the edge of frame.

CUT TO:

CHARLES, nearby: he watches CARRIE and HAMISH walk away from
the Church together.

49. OTEL. ENT: CE HALL. DAY. 49.

The Reception takes place in a beautiful large London
Ballroom, downstairs in an expensive Hotel. This is a very
aristocratic wedding. All men are in full wedding gear,
there's a lot of silk and posh voices.

At the entrance there is a table where people put their gifts.
GEORGE, from the Boatman, approaches the table with a huge
present, beautifully wrapped. He puts it down and heads to
join the line.

Next GARETH sweeps in - he puts down a very small unimpressive
looking gift. He inspects the other gifts, looks around to
check no-one is watching and swaps the card on his with the
card on George's present. He smiles happily and heads down
the sweeping staircase to the ballroom. .

He passes the long queue and simply joins his friends at the
front near the beginning of the receiving line. The bride is
in her still splattered dress.
44

Standing at the front of the line is someone '‘liveried', The
Master of Ceremonies. He dips his head and has a word with
every guest, very discreetly...

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
I think you should know that Lord
Hibbott is a little deaf, sir.

MATTHEW
oO thank you

He moves on - and after shaking hands with the wife, gets to
the first father, Sir John Delaney

MATTHEW
(Very loud)
EXCELLENT WEDDING - I WAS IN HEAVEN

SIR JOHN
I'm delighted

MATTHEW moves on and FIONA approaches SIR JOHN also shouting

FIONA
THE BRIDE LOOKED STUNNING! YOU MUST
BE VERY PROUD!

SIR JOHN
Yes, I am (he leans across to his
-wife) Why is everybody shouting at
me?

CUT THROUGH TO:
MATTHEW talking to the next Father.

MATTHEW
Ir thought the Church looked
exquisite.

LORD HIBBOTT
Didn't she? Beautiful tiara I
thought.

MATTHEW
(worried) Yes.

MATTHEW moves on. LORD HIBBOT looks angrily down the line
at THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES. FIONA approaches.

FIONA
I thought your son looked very
handsome.
 

45

LORD HIBBOTT
(worried but trying hard)
Yes, I believe the prawns are
delicious.

Meanwhile GARETH approaches the exasperated first father

GARETH
BRAVO - AN ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID
OCCASION ALL ROUND.

SIR JOHN
(fuming) Thank you.

CHARLES
LOVELY WEDDING! EXQUISITE FLOWERS IN
THE CHURCH.

SIR JOHN
(shouting) For heaven's sake, stop
shouting at me! I can hear
perfectly well!! It's that deaf
idiot there you should be shouting
at! oO

CHARLES stumbles forward to a waiting GARETH

GARETH
Dear me. Drink?

CHARLES
(bit shaken) Yes. Excellent. That
or cyanide.
50. iT. HOTEL. BA: IM. : oO.

They move forward into the ballroom, and CHARLES glimpses
CARRIE and HAMISH again.

CHARLES (cont)
I've got a bad feeling about this
wedding.
CUT TO:
Two very well bred little Honourables.

10 YEAR OLD LADY JANE
Where do you fit in?

9 YEAR OLD RIGHT HONOURABLE HARRY
I'm the groom's brother. You?

LADY JANE
I'm the Bride's cousin.
HON HARRY
oO. When I was little, I went into
my brother's bedroom, and he was
pushing his willie into another boy.

LADY JANE
oO. I must tell Lydia - she says she
wants to know everything about
Bernie.

curT TO:

GARETH, MATTHEW, DAVID, CHARLES. GARETH is sipping
excellent Champagne.

GARETH
' Ah, that's better. Marriage: it's
like the Masons isn't it. You can't
ask to join the club. You just have
! to wait till true love knocks on
your door and gives you the funny
handshake. Then suddenly, there you
are, saying 'I do'.

CHARLES
Precisely - it's so random there's
no point looking in my opinion.

MATTHEW
I'm not sure about 'random'.- I do
think handsome boys tend to marry
handsome girls..

GARETH
Not a rule, though, is it - Prince
Philip's a good-looking man, while
on the other hand, the Queen...

TOM passes by, looking busy about his duties.

GARETH
Ah Thomas, how's the speech?

TOM
Pretty good I think - something for
everyone - tears, laughter...

GARETH
Excellent.

TOM does a double thumbs up and heads on.
CHARLES

If like does marry like, where do I
fit in then?

46
 

47

GARETH
Well, I'm better on men than women:
for instance...him (very pretty boy)
no chance, whereas him (old man) you
could probably do hetter.

CHARLES
And girls...

GARETH
Well, let's see. Her (a total
beauty) I wouldn't get over
optimistic

CHARLES
No..

But suddenly the pretty woman heads straight towards him

CHARLES
oO my God.

GARETH
Stay calm. I feel a funny handshake
coming on - I'll make myself scarce,
look I'm gone.

CHARLES
No, st......

He turns and finds that GARETH isn't there any longer.

PRETTY WOMAN
Hi - you probably won't remember me
- we met at a party at Lydia's.

CHARLES
God yes, that's right. Having a
good time?

PRETTY WOMAN
So so, so far...

And over her shoulder is GARETH with a big thumbs up and
CHARLES raises his eyebrows - yes there may be something here.

GARETH turns and walks through a crowd of chattering upper
class voices - lots of 'splendid' 'Roderick!' and 'Do you know

Geraldine?' He passes the Priest and acknowledges him

GARETH
Father: sublime service.

Actually FATHER GERALD is talking to SCARLETT.
 

CUT TO:

48

SCARLETT
Yes, you were great.

FATHER GERALD
Did you think so? I thought I
cocked it up a little.

SCARLETT
Well, now you say it, you did
totally - but don't worry - it's
usually so boring, and I really
enjoyed it this time.

CHARLES and THE PRETTY WOMAN are getting on famously. They
take a nibble each as a tray passes by.

CHARLES :
.--almost had enough of weddings
actually. I've been to 7 this year.

PRETTY WOMAN
You must get bored af champagne and
salmon.

CHARLES
Yes, catering's always the problen.
The worst one I went to, the sister
had done it. Unbelievable - though
at least one knew who to lie to.

PRETTY WOMAN
Yes.

CHARLES
It just seems as though it's
impossible to get it right. I mean
look at this. Suppose it's meant to
be asparagus - but it looks and
tastes like a dead man's penis.
Now, tell me, what do you do?

PRETTY WOMAN
I'm a caterer.

CHARLES
Good Lord - so you know what I'm
talking about. Do you ever do
weddings?

PRETTY WOMAN
Yes.
 

49
CHARLES
They should have asked you to do
this one.

PRETTY WOMAN

They did.

CHARLES
God - I wish you hadn't turned it
down.

PRETTY WOMAN
I didn't.

_LONG PAUSE.

CHARLES
Excellent. Excellent. If you'll
just excuse me a moment, I think
this knife should be sharp enough
for the de-testiculation process.
As he moves away, he again is passed by CARRIE and HAMISH.
curt ON TO:

GARETH :
Don't worry - let's have a look -
I'm sure you'll be sitting next to
“someone marvellous.
They inspect the seating plan. They can't believe it.

CHARLES
O God. This must be a joke.

CHARLES shakes his head - everything is going wrong for
hin.

CUT TO:
Spoon banging on a table.
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen.

Dinner is served.

cur To:

Everyone sitting down. At the top table, TOM is busy
correcting his speech with a confident smile on his face.

cuT TO:

GARETH's table. GARETH approaches, talking to GEORGE.
 

GEORGE
I always take a lot of trouble over
the present. I think it really
matters, don't you?

GARETH who stole the present replies...
GARETH
oO yes. It's months, isn't it,
months to get it right.

At his table are many of the friends... and CARRIE.

GARETH
Hello, I'm Gareth - and you look
divine.

CARRIE
I'm Carrie.

GARETH
This is Matthew, this is Fiona, this
is Scarlett - they're my closest

friends. OI think we're all going
to be very happy together...

CUT TO:

CHARLES sitting down - actually his table looks all right.
It's 4. girls, 3 men, all presentable and his age. And DAVID.

CHARLES
Hi.

TONY
Hello, I'm Tony. And I believe you
know Veronica.

CHARLES
Yes.

He's uneasy about something.

cuT To:

FIONA chatting to a rather grand MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN at the
table.

MRS BEAUMONT
And tell me, are you married?

FIONA
No.-

MRS BEAUMONT
Are you a lesbian?
 

~~ wry wer —w

CUT TO:

CHARLES'S table ~ DAVID seems to be relishing the situation.

CHARLES is just that little bit tense.

FIONA
Why do you say that?

MRS BEAUMONT
Well, it's one of the possibilities
with unmarried women, and a bit more
interesting than saying - "O dear,
just haven't met the right chap,
eh"?

FIONA
Good on you, I always assume middle-
aged people are dull and totally the
same - it's lovely to meet one who
isn't.

MRS BEAUMONT
Thank you.

FIONA
No, truth is, though, I have met the
right man - unfortunately, he
doesn't love me - and until I stop
loving him, no-one else stands a
chance.

MRS BEAUMONT
Bad luck.

FIONA .
Isn't it? I was a lesbian once, at
school - but only for an hour and a
half, so I don’t think it counts.

TONY
So there are 400 different kinds of
tea and that isn't including all
these so-called fruit teas. I took
Veronica out to India to have a look
at the plantations at Christmas.

CHARLES
Excellent.

CARRIE laughing with the others.

TONY
I believe you and she went out there
once.

51

He looks over and sees
 

— — wee we

-w-~

-—— ~w —w~ wow:

52

CHARLES
That's right.

VERONICA
Charles was vile - he insisted on
cracking jokes all the time I was
being sick.

CHARLES
I was trying to cheer you up.

NIKKI
O, you're THAT Veronica.

VERONICA
Which Veronica?

CHARLES looks a little panicky.

NICKI
O well, when Charles and I were
going out he told me he'd had
this..'interesting' journey round
India with ‘Vomiting Veronica' I
think that was it.

CHARLES
Seriously, I don't remember ever
mentioning it.

IRIS
O come on Charles, I don't think
I've ever been out with. anyone less
discreet.

The true horror of the situation is now becoming clear.

IRIS (cont)
I remember you going on about this
girl Helena, was it, whose Mother
made a pass at you.

MARTHA
I remember this - you couldn't work
out whether it would be impolite not
to accept her advances.

NICKI
That's right! Mrs Piggy - Helena was
Miss Piggy, so her mother was Mrs
Piggy.

CHARLES
Yes, I think perhaps...
53

Everyone can't but notice that he is looking massively
uncomfortable. They all turn to the final girl on the table.

HELENA
We've both lost a lot of weight
since then.
CHARLES in total despair.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Ladies and gentlemen - the Best Man.

CHARLES
Ah - excellent, the speeches.
DAVID
Did_yo or] Pi ?
CHARLES
1 d_not!!!

' CUT TO:
TOM standing, convinced he's on to a winner.

: TOM

Ahm...when Bernard told me he was
’ getting engaged to _ Lydia, I

congratulated him because all his

other girlfriends had been complete

dogs - although, may I say how

delighted we are to have so many of

them here this evening.

CHARLES shakes his head, GARETH is delighted.
CUT TO:

The drinks table, later. All of them gathered.

GARETH
We had the most fabulous girl on our
table - called Carrie-

CHARLES
Don't tell me - I know.

GARETH
She asked us all round to dinner.
Apparently her fiancee is terribly
grand and owns half of Scotland.
How were you?
CHARLES
I seem to be stuck in the wedding
from hell. The next thing you know,
I'll bump into Henrietta and the
horror will be complete.

From behind him comes a voice

HENRIETTA
Hello, Charles.

He turns around, and there is a strained looking girl.

CHARLES
Hello, Hen. How are you?
PAUSE. Then her face just collapses. She bursts into
tears...

CHARLES (cont)
O Hen..

HENRIETTA'S FRIEND
Look, can't you just leave her alone
- haven't you hurt her enough?
And takes her away. CHARLES turns to GARETH.
CHARLES
‘Excuse me’ - I think I better be
where other people are not.

As CHARLES walks out, he passes DAVID.

CHARLES
Just saw Henrietta.
DAVID
You ruined her life, you heartless
bastard.
CHARLES
Thanks fo: our s rt.

CHARLES then passes SERENA and the camera stays with her.
She approaches DAVID, easing up to him as before, via the
canapes- She misjudges it and bumps into hin.

SERENA
I'm sorry.

He waves it away - no matter. She stands opposite hin.
Pause. Then she starts to sign, very slowly. The subtitles
translate.
55

SERENA
Hello, my name is Serena.

DAVID laughs sweetly.

DAVID
Hello, Serena.

She looks totally confused. He repeats it, very slowly, in
finger sign..

DAVID
H-e-1-1-o0. You sign very well.
SERENA
Thank you. I'n just learming. I'n
progagly naking lobs of nistakes.

DAVID shakes his head.

DAVID
No erfect.

He does a little mime, which asks her if she fancies a
dance.

SERENA
Yes that would be mice.
51. INT. HOTEL. CO! Re GHT.. : 51.

CHARLES, with the sound of music in the background - he
looks along a corridor, then nips into a little room, where
he can be alone.

52. - HOTEL. ROOM. NIGHT. 52.

It contains just a bed and a dressing table. On the bed is
a suit, and a girl's skirt and blouse. He goes to the
window, and, peaceful at last, looks out over London.

There is a sound - he turns around, and sees the door
opening. BERNARD and LYDIA enter the room - they don't see
him - but turn and quickly lock the door. It is in fact
the room for changing into their going away clothes.

CHARLES is a little worried by this.
BERNARD
I'll turn off the light - don't want
to attract attention.

CHARLES nods. The light goes out, in the darkness we hear
rustling. .
 

56

LYDIA
Wait a minute, this is no fun! I
want to see my lovely husband.

The light goes on again. They are half undressed and
CHARLES is stranded directly behind them: they do not see
him.

CUT IN: close on them, then pan around - and CHARLES has
disappeared. The couple are now almost naked: The camera
moves down to under the bed, where we expect CHARLES to be.
There seems to be nowhere else in the room where he could
fit.

Finally he emerges from a suitcase, as behind him the
couple are having sex. He crawls towards a dressing table,
which has little curtains under it. He crawls between them
- at last he is protected. He looks at his watch. This
could be a long haul...

53. Lr HOTEL OOM. NIGHT 53.
SCARLETT is under a table with her 8 year old fellow

bridesmaid, FREDA. SCARLETT talks to her straight, as she
does to everyone.

SCARLETT
Have you got a boyfriend?
FREDA
Yes.
SCARLETT

What's his name?

FREDA
Dolph. He's good at table tennis.
What about you?

SCARLETT
No. 'Fraid not.
FREDA
Why not?
SCARLETT

I don't know - chaps I fancy think
I'm stupid, so they just shag me and
leave me. And chaps who fancy me,
I think they're stupid and can't
even be bothered to shag them.

FREDA
I see.
57

PAUSE. SCARLETT taken up in her thoughts about this rather
accurate self-analysis.

FREDA
What's 'shagging'?

SCARLETT
0 don't be stupid, you know, when a
man and a woman take off their
clothes and...

FREDA
0, 'fucking'.

SCARLETT
That's right.

FREDA
You should forget about fucking.
It's nothing but trouble.
4. TEL. BEDROOM. HOTEL. : 4.

CHARLES is still concealed. There is an orgasm in the
background. CHARLES checks his watch.

BERNARD
) oO, I love my wife.

LYDIA
And I love my husband.

BERNARD sighs contentedly. Beneath his dressing table,
CHARLES looks relieved.

BERNARD
Still, we better be going back.

CHARLES nods.
LYDIA
Yes. Or we could just wait a few
minutes, and have another go.
CHARLES shakes his head in intense disagreement.
BERNARD
Well, there's a_ thought. You
naughty, naughty little rabbit.

CHARLES'S head in his hands

BERNARD and LYDIA on the bed. CHARLES politely steps out
from the dressing table. He walks past them. They are
very surprised. He holds up a pencil.

 
 

CHARLES
Found it.

55. INT. HOTEL. CORRIDOR. NIGHT. 55.

As he shuts the door behind him, CHARLES turns and bumps
straight into HENRIETTA. She is very beautiful - but
tonight, very highly strung.

HENRIETTA
Charles, we must talk.

CHARLES
(trapped, but kindly)
Must we?

HENRIETTA :
It's just I'd like to help you.

CHARLES
That's awfully kind, Hen, but...

HENRIETTA
The thing is, Charlie, I've spoken
to lots of people about you.

CHARLES
O God -

HENRIETTA :
Everybody agrees - you'll never

really love anyone, because you
never let them near you. You're
sweet to them, and affectionate to
them... you were even sweet to me
and you thought I was an idiot.

CHARLES
I did not!

HENRIETTA
You did. I thought U2 was a type of
submarine.

. CHARLES
Did you?

HENRIETTA
But it's like from the beginning of
every relationship, you're looking
for a way out.

CHARLES
Well, sometimes, I admit - I mean,
take that girl with the big knife.
 

59

HENRIETTA
Be serious Charles! You must give
people a chance. You don't have to
think "I must get married" - but you
mustn't think "I mustn't get
married".

CHARLES
Hen, you know me - most of the time
I don't think at all - I just potter
along.

HENRIETTA
Q Charles (She suddenly puts her
arms around him) - the way you used
to look at me. I just misread it,
that's all - you were thinking about
leaving - O Christ... this is so
ridiculous.

She walks . away. CHARLES is left, slightly stunned.
Suddenly at his shoulder.

CARRIE
She looked happy.

CHARLES
Yes, it's a great night. Up there
with my father's funeral for sheer
.entertainment value.

CARRIE
I'm off - keep me company.

This is kind of her, a little protective. They head for
the top of the stairs.

56. INT. HOTEL. BALLROOM ST. . NIGHT. 56.

Everyone is at the bottom - clearly waiting for the bride
and groom to come down. MATTHEW raises a quizzical eyebrow
at GARETH. HENRIETTA bursts into tears again. It just
gets worse.

When they're half way down, everyone applauds and BERNARD
and LYDIA come downstairs.

ALL
Bravo!l!it

Beneath her jacket LYDIA reveals a t-shirt with the slogan
“BE GENTLE, I'M A VIRGIN".

MATTHEW
Excellent t-shirt.
60

GARETH
Yes. I suspect not technically
true.

Much cheering. LYDIA throws the bouquet. GARETH jumps for
it enthusiastically, high above the rest. He catches it -

and then graciously hands it to the first lady by his side
- it's CARRIE.

GARETH
Madan.

CARRIE
Thank you (whispered to Charles)
Definitely time to go. Share a cab?

CHARLES
Husband?

CARRIE
Fiancee - gone to Edinburgh on the
sleeper.

CHARLES

Okay. Though I promised I'd give
Scarlett a ...0 sod it. I'm sure
she's fine.

57. INT._HO' OOM. NIGHT. 57.

SCARLETT, not very sober, in conversation with FATHER
GERALD.

SCARLETT
Just checking: your kind of vicar -
I know you can't get married, but
how do things stand vis a vis just
sort of, you know, sex in general,
I mean, are you allowed to?

FATHER GERALD
Not really.

SCARLETT
© bad luck. Still - worth asking,
eh? Just in case.
58. Tt. HOTEL. NIGHT. 58.

A taxi stops for CHARLES and CARRIE. Being with her has put
him in a good mood.

. CHARLES
Here we go.
 

61

CARRIE
Thank you.

A voice interrupts them from behind. It's GEORGE from The
Boatman.

GEORGE
'Scuse me - not going to
Knightsbridge are you?

CARRIE
Yes, go on, hop in.

CHARLES closes his eyes in horror.

GEORGE
Good Lord - it's you - Kathy - how
are you?
CARRIE
Very well...
59. INT. IN. S.oN 59.

Splendid bloke Bernard -

Yes.

CHARLES
God, it's lovely to see you. How
are you, how are you and what
fucking total disaster of a disaster
has led to the situation where
suddenly you're married?

CARRIE
Engaged.

CHARLES
Same thing really.

CARRIE
Here we are ...come on in (the taxi
stops) Have a night cap.
PAUSE. He looks at her hard.

CHARLES
Do you really think I should?

CARRIE
(with huge irony) I think we can
risk it. I'm pretty sure I can
resist you - you're not that cute.

CHARLES
Okay. (genuinely embarrassed)

62. INT. IE'S FLAT. NT : 62.
The flat is in darkness. The lights aren't on. When
finally we do reach them, they are just about to kiss.

discussing bridesmaids.

CHARLES
You're right. I've got very little
to contribute on that one.

Silently CHARLES dresses.

CHARLES (cont)
Would you like to go out
sometime....

CARRIE
(not lifting her head from the
pillow) No thanks.

CHARLES
Why?
 

64

CARRIE

Too dangerous. I love my fiance.
CHARLES

Good reason. You see, this is my

whole argument against marriage -
even when I'd found the right girl -
I'd keep bumping into people like
you.

He hand comes up and waves him goodbye. He hesitates. and
then turns to go. An alarm clock rings.
 

65

AUTUMN
69.INT. CHARLES BEDROOM. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY.69

CHARLES sits up and switches off the alarm with a smile -
then smugly goes back to sleep again.

CAPTION: 2 MONTHS LATER

His door opens. It is SCARLETT wearing a t-shirt that says
"I Love John Major". She carries a cup of tea - and some
toast.

SCARLETT
Morning. Tea. Mail. Junkmail. Toast
- sorry, it's a bit burnt.

cU a very very burnt piece of toast entering Charles's
mouth.

CHARLES
Thanks.

CHARLES takes a big, white envelope and tears it open. It
is a formal invitation.

CHARLES

oO no. I can't go to any more
weddings - they last too long and ny
waistcoat doesn't fit. (He reads
it): "Mr and Mrs Gregory Hartnell
the Third invite you to the wedding
of their daughter Judith Caroline to
Sir Hamish Banks" (He is mystified)
Who are these people?

SCARLETT takes the invite and inspects.

SCARLETT
O look - it says 'plus guest' - can
I come?

CHARLES goes on eating and talking.

CHARLES

It's a novel idea isn't it - sending
wedding invites to people you don't
know. "Dear Greg, Thanks very much
for your totally charming
invitation. Unfortunately, I've
never fucking heard of you or your
daughter Judith, so I fear I shan't
be attending". Christ - what a
cheek - they've even put in a
wedding list!
 

. 66

We now glimpse the back of Scarlett's t-shirt. It says
"Only Joking".

SCARLETT
Actually, I think it's that American
girl you slept with at Laura's
wedding. Her name was Carrie,
wasn't it?

CHARLES
Yes - but this one's called Judith.

SCARLETT
Second name Caroline.

CHARLES
Good Lord. I think you're right.
Dammit. Why didn't I marry her?
Can you remember?

SCARLETT .
Because you only met her twice, and
you rather threw away the chance of
a deep and meaningful relationship
by banging her on both occasions.

CHARLES

O yes.

70. INT. KT’ ._ CHARLES AND SCARLETT'S HOUSE. DAY. 70.

CHARLES

Right - I'm going out.
SCARLETT

OK- but over here first...(she

stands hin in front of

her)...because you've been cutting
it a bit fine recently, haven't you?

CHARLES
Yes. And eveyone's starting to hate
me.
SCARLETT
Right. Who are you meeting today?
CHARLES
David.
SCARLETT
When?
CHARLES

At 4 o'clock.
67

SCARLETT
What time does that mean you have to
be there by?

CHARLES
5 at the very latest.

71 EXT. LIBERTY'S. . 71.
CHARLES outside.

Zila. INT. LIBERTY'S. DAY. 7ia.

CHARLES walks in to the Oriental Department. It is a room
full of ceramic tigers, exotic carpets, woven baskets,
beautiful silks, wooden carvings. He approaches an
assistant. She is very snooty. She feels Charles's casual
shirt and sneakers don't fit in with the spirit of the
store.

CHARLES
Hello, I'm here to maybe buy
something off a wedding list.

ASSISTANT
What's the name, sir?

CHARLES
It's Hartnell, I think, or Banks.
ASSISTANT
Banks, o yes, sir, we have a Banks.
Lovely list.
CHARLES
Could you tell me some prices?
ASSISTANT -
Certainly, sir - there are some
beautiful things about the £1000
mark.
CHARLES

Yes, I was thinking about something
more like, well, 50.

ASSISTANT
So, you'd like to buy tthree knives
and a fork?

CHARLES
That's what I get for 50 quid?

 
68

ASSISTANT
Yes - for £51 you get two knives and
two forks - but we don't want to
smash through your budget barrier.
Or you could have that ceramic
leopard over there...

CHARLES
Ah, excellent, that's more like it.
ASSISTANT
If you can find someone to chip in
£11,950.
CHARLES smiles.
ASSISTANT

Or our carrier bags are £1.50 - you
could just get 33 of them.

CHARLES
Actually, I think I'll leave it.
Thanks very much. You've been very
helpful.

He turns and bumps straight into CARRIE. She's just in
jeans and a white t-shirt, her hair down, very different:
much plainer, but still, in her way, lovely. She's ina
very good mood.

CARRIE
Whatcha get?

CHARLES
Nothing yet - just deciding.

CARRIE
It's so great this! I should have
married years ago. I love getting
presents. (To the Assistant) Anyone
go for the leopard yet?

ASSISTANT
No. The young man was thinking about
it.
CHARLES nods thoughtfully.
CARRIE
O no - just get me a knife and fork

or something. Hey, you haven't got
half an hour have you?
69

CHARLES
Surely - I've got to meet my brother
at...five..thirty..but I can be a
bit late.

CARRIE
Great. You've got an important
decision to make.
As they walk away

CARRIE (V/0)
I've waited all my life for this
particular shopping experience.

72. -_STO) IGING .- DAY. 72.
CARRIE (V/0)
All right - now the most important
thing is that you mustn't laugh.

CHARLES
Okay.

She emerges in a plain, formal, typical... WEDDING DRESS.
She is, despite herself, quite shy about it.

CARRIE
What do you think?
He looks at her, and then laughs gently...as if there's any
question...
CHARLES
Divine.

CARRIE
Okay - that's a start - let's go.

Music starts - you can guess the style of the wedding dress
from the dialogue.

CARRIE emerges again.

CHARLES
Gorgeous....not quite my style.

CARRIE
Meringue.

CHARLES
Rather.

kaRK

CARRIE in a white satin hot pants suit.

 
 

CHARLES
You're kidding.

CARRIE
But it would be great, wouldn't it.

CHARLES
If I were your husband, I would die
of pride.

CARRIE
Yeh, I think Hamish would die full
stop.
eke
She emerges again.
CHARLES
That's it - perfect - sexy and yet
traditional.

CARRIE
It's the petticoat.

CHARLES
Ah.

keeK

She walks out - it's a little bo-peep type - lots of lace
and silk bows.

CARRIE
This is the dress. What do you
think?

CHARLES

CARRIE

I knew it - I knew it -
She goes back in.

CHARLES
But if you can get a little staff it
would be very good for looking after
sheep.

CARRIE (V/0)
Don't be rude. A lot of people have
been very happy in that dress.

kK
 

71

She comes out in bra and pants and poses for a split second
like a fifties model

CARRIE
And then there's always the beach
look.

And runs straight back in again.

CHARLES
It's no wonder husbands aren't
allowed to see this - they would

realise they were not worthy.

keke

CARRIE (V/0O)
Right - ignore the dress - it's
trains we're talking about now.
What do we think?

cuT TO:

CARRIE is standing at the door of the store - the train
stretches right back into the changing room - 30 feet.

CHARLES
You look mad.

kkkKK

CARRIE (V/0)
Second to last. I think it might be
a bit sexy.

She emerges in a silver-sequined full length sheath -
staggering, she looks like a mermaid. It is divinity.

CHARLES
I'm speechless.
CARRIE
Yeh - I kind of figured.
CHARLES
I mean, I adore it - but there's

nothing in the world more off-
putting at a wedding than a priest
with an enormous erection.

ReRE

CARRIE (V/0O)
ok, and finally, kind of
traditional, but kind of nice.
 

72

She comes out - it is beautiful - for the first time she is
wearing a veil. CHARLES is silent. She lifts the veil
slowly. It is a magical moment. Beyond comment.

73. NT. TEA ROOM. DAY. 73.

It's polite and old-fashioned. On the table in front of
CHARLES and CARRIE is a pot of tea and a slice of
Battenburg cake. Outside, it is pouring with rain.

CHARLES
Do you mind the fact that it's
always raining in England?

CARRIE
I love it - when we were young and
it rained, my Dad always took us out
in big yellow coats, with no
umbrellas and we'd fool around 'till
the rain stopped - so for my family,
rain's a happy thing.

CHARLES
That's a sickeningly wholesome story
- what did your Dad do when it was
sunny?

CARRIE
He locked us in the basement and
-beat us with sticks. .

CHARLES laughs. During the scene, they are both eating the
slice of cake - but neither will finish it. At first this
is quite reasonable - they each take little pieces with
their forks, leaving enough for the other. But finally
they're actually dividing the crumbs.

CHARLES
One really strange thing is thinking
you'll never sleep with anyone else.
You don't think you'll ever be
unfaithful?

CARRIE
No - not once we're married - I've
told Hamish I'll kill him if he is -
so I think I better stick by that.

CHARLES
Quite right. Although just before
he died John Betjeman was asked if
he had any regrets in life and he
said he wished he'd slept around
more.

 
 

73

CARRIE
No - I reckon I've had a fair run at
it.
CHARLES
How many is a fair run these days?
CARRIE
0, I don't know - more than... one.
CHARLES
Like - how many? I've seen the

dress - I can take anything now.

CARRIE
Well...

At first she's unwilling, but then she gets drawn in,
counting them out on her fingers.

CARRIE (cont)
Okay - let's see. Right - 1 - not
easily forgotten. Kind of nice. 2
- mistake, hairy back. 3 ~ lovely,
getting into the swing of it now. 4,
5, 6, that was my birthday present.

CHARLES
Which birthday?

CARRIE
Sixteen I think.

CHARLES
We've only reached sixteen?

CARRIE
That's right: I was brought up in
the country - endless fooling around
in barns. Then there was 7 - yummy
- 8 - yummy yummy - 9 - against a
fence - really uncomfortable — don't
try it...

CHARLES
I won't.

CARRIE
Then 10 - ah, 10 - he was the really
annoying one we all have, when you
say, "o no , why didn't I know all
this stuff before?" - I wasted one
to nine. 11 - obviously, in the
circumstances, very disappointing.
 

CHARLES mouths

: 74

CARRIE (cont)

12 - still recovering. 13 - 90, so
there's even more to it. 14, 15, 16,
17 - the University years - lovely,
intelligent, sensitive boys -
sexually speaking, a real low patch.
18 - he broke my heart. Long years
of yearning.

CHARLES
I'm sorry.

CARRIE
After which came 19 - who I don't
remember, but my room-mate said we
definitely did it - 20 - long one -
3 years. 21 - my Fatal Attraction.

CHARLES
He went crazy?

CARRIE .
No, he looked like Michael Douglas.
22 - that was my first year in
England ~- I love English guys - 23
and 24 together, which was
something...

CHARLES
You're joking.

CARRIE
No, it was a holiday, I was brown,
they were foreign, sure beat
conversation, and we're still ages
before AIDS. 25 - gorgeous - older
man. 26 - dreadful - older man. 27
- that was a mistake.

CHARLES
Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?

CARRIE

He had a really bad cold - I thought
it wouldn't matter - it did.
Actually there are a few nasty ones
round here - lots of rather grand
Frenchman I thought were glamorous.
Very nearly gave up on the whole
thing. But Spencer changed ny mind,
that's 28. His father - 29...

'HIS FATHER! !'
 

75

CARRIE (cont)
Then 30 - he shouted a lot, which I
found odd, 31 - fine, 32 - lovely.
And my fiancee - 33.

CHARLES
So I came after your fiancee
CARRIE
No, you were 32.
CHARLES
O thank you.
CARRIE

So there we have it - something to
tell my daughters. Now what about

you?
CHARLES
(panic) Me?
CARRIE
Yes - how many girls have you slept
with?
CHARLES

© God, ahm, well, nothing like that
many. I don't know what the fuck
I've been doing with my time
actually. Work probably - that's
it. Work.

CARRIE
Well, go on.

CHARLES
Ahn, well, lets see -

He counts on his fingers - 1,2,3. Pause. 4th finger. Long
pause.

CHARLES
o, it must be about twenty.

CARRIE
No, go on, try harder.

CHARLES
(He just can't come up with the
numbers) Five... six... all right,
about 15.

CARRIE
My husband says he's slept with 84.
 

76

CHARLES
That's a lie - he's lying. He's a
filthy liar.

CARRIE
Apparently not. He was very perky
in his 30's.

CHARLES
Was he? 0, God. I've wasted ny
life! Here I am, having tea when I
should be out scouring the streets.
Look, do you mind if I pay 'n' run,
I've got serious shagging to do.

She laughs. Both of them just stop talking. CHARLES
watches her sipping her tea, and smiles. Something's
happened. She has a bite of cake - then looks at him
calmly - he snaps out of it.

CHARLES
Sorry - Sorry. (Pause) I wish I'd
rung you. (She smiles) But then you
didn't ring me _ either. You
ruthlessly slept with me twice, and
then never rang me.

CARRIE
(gentler) That's another strange
thing about getting married - you
look back on all the people you've
been with, and...you get sentimental
about them, and you think about
other decisions you might have made.

They look at each other. Pause. She decides to break it.

-+-Who knows, maybe I should have given
the guy with the hairy back another chance -
there are creams.

They both laugh. These are two people who should be
together.
CARRIE
I have to go soon.

CHARLES

O Christ - (looks at his watch) -
come with me - be my excuse.

74. EXT. OXFORD STREET. DAY. 74.

DAVID is waiting outside. As they approach - DAVID signs

DAVID
Whatever your excuse, you're doomed.
I_disown you, and if you ever have
children I intend to abuse them...

CHARLES
Carrie this is David, my brother.
David this is Carrie.

CARRIE
Hi

DAVID
I've seen ou__at a couple of

weddings.

CHARLES
He says he's seen you at a couple of
weddings.

DAVID
Christ she is absolutely adorable,
isn't she?

CHARLES to translate it

CHARLES ,
He says it was Lydia and Laura's.
Iwas looking for her wedding
present when I bumped into her.
That's why I'm late.

DAVID
Pathetic. Who's she marrying?

CHARLES
Some total penis.

DAVID
What is it about total penises that
they get such great wives?

CHARLES
I just told him you were getting
married - he says your husband must
be a pretty special person.

DAVID
idn't u_do it with her once?

CARRIE
What did he say?

CHARLES
Where are you doing it?

CARRIE
Look, guys - I've got to be going.
I'm expected at a rehearsal.

CHARLES

DAVID
Say something - this is your last

CHARLES
Say what?
DAVID
“Ditch the prick, marry me instead"
CARRIE
Thanks for the tea. I really

enjoyed it. See you at the wedding.

CHARLES
Yes, great.

CARRIE
Goodbye David, I hope you can get
the car fixed.

78

CHARLES nods thoughtfully as though maybe DAVID is right.
They watch her

And he sprints off after he...his mind made up.

79

CHARLES
(absentmindedly)
Goodb: - hope you get the car
fixed.

DAVID

DAVID
As_a_brother I've got to say, TI

CHARLES
Q yes and fat chance she's going to

He turns

the corner - no glimpse of her.

75. EXT. HANOVER _SOU: . DAY. 75

He runs into Hanover Square -

there she is - he dodges

) traffic and ends up right in front of her.

CHARLES
Ahm look -

CARRIE
Hi.

CHARLES

I know this is a stupid question -
particularly in view of our recent
shopping trip - but I just wondered
whether you're sure - well, of
course you're sure, but I just
wondered whether there's any chance
- I mean, obviously not, I'm just
some git who's only slept with 9
people but I just wondered whether -
I know I'm going to regret this even
as I say it, but I really
feel...ahm...in short, ina slightly
clearer version - in the words of
David Cassidy in fact - 'I think I
love you' and I wonder whether you
wouldn't by any chance like to...no,
of course not, that's the answer
really isn't it - I'm an idiot, he's
not. Fantastic. Lovely to see you.
Sorry to disturb you - better get
on. Fuck.
80
PAUSE

CARRIE
That was very romantic....

CHARLES
Well I thought it over a lot, wanted
to get it just right...

CARRIE
No, I mean it.

CHARLES
The thing is...I just feel...you
don't just feel do you...

CARRIE
I'm getting married in 14 days
time...

CHARLES
Yes. I agree. I just wanted to have
said it -

CARRIE
Said what?

CHARLES
Well, (absolutely rushes it) would
you like to marry me...just in case
you're being forced into this
marriage by some kind of hideous
blackmail... If that's the case - if
there's some grotesque plot to make
you marry a man you absolutely hate,
I'm willing to step in and save you.

CARRIE
Thank you. I really appreciate
that. You're lovely.

She kisses him and walks away. He is left on the streets.
The alarm goes off.

76. INT. WEDDING 3. SCOTTISH CHURCH. DUSK. 76.

A church in Scotland. It is evening, and it looks like a
dream, like a fairytale, completely lit with candles.
CARRIE is at the altar. Her wedding dress is the loveliest
that we have seen.

VICAR
Therefore, if any man can show any
just cause or impediment why they
may not be lawfully joined together,
let them speak now.
 

81

There is a bang at the back door. The congregation turns -
it is CHARLES.

CHARLES
(mouthing)
Sorry.
The service continues.
VICAR

Do you take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband, to have and
to hold from this day forth as long
as ye both shall live?

CARRIE
I do.
CUT TO:
CHARLES, taking it in.
CHARLES
(Last gasp of exhausted defeat)
Fuckadoodle-doo.

A song plays in V/O:

YVONNE FAIR
It should have been me!
It should have been me!
You know, it should have been me!
Baby how can you do this to me?

CUT TO:
The rather irksome Best Man is reading the lesson.

If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels, but have not love, I
am become a sounding brass, or a
clanging cymbal.

DURING THIS, pan across a smiling row of guests - then
reach CHARLES, his head in his hands on ‘But have not
love'.

77. EXT. WEDDING 3. SCOTTISH CHURCH. DUSK. 77.

You're a very lucky man.

HAMISH
I know.

CHARLES
(To Carrie)
You looked beautiful. Not a
meringue in sight.

CARRIE
Thanks. Let's hope tonight we can
resist our usual wedding behaviour.

CHARLES
Yes...

He moves on - he is stopped by a photographer.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Sir - if you'd like to just step
over here - we're taking pictures
for the couple.

He is led over to a corner, where the photographer is set
up with props and lights and a particularly rich tableau,
with deer, and kilted wax figures.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Please yes - how about you hold the
spear - that's right. And the

haggis, yes, very funny.
CHARLES deeply gloony.

PHOTOGRAPHER (cont)
Now smile - show them how delighted
you are - that's right - a great big
grin for the bride and groom to
remember you by.

He grins - it is the direct opposite of what he is feeling.
CHARLES
Yes, look excuse me, I just
remembered I have to ring my mother:
she's in a coma...

And he moves on. He turns the corner and...

79. INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. RECEPTION. DUSK. 79.

CHARLES
Good lord.

...before him is an extraordinary sight...

The entire Hall has been transformed into a Medieval
Scottish World, of roasting animals, and burning braziers -
strange tableaux of scenes from Scottish history threaten
in the corners.

In the corner are a Scottish band all ready to suggest that
the people spend the evening dancing reels.

curt TO:

The friends - as in the first wedding, gathered to survey
the scene: GARETH at his most exuberant.

GARETH
What can one say - it's sodding
Macbeth!

SCARLETT

Do you think those deer are real?
FIONA closes her eyes at this.

GARETH .
Dearest things - I've decided to set
you all a challenge: as you know,
there is at the moment not a wedding
ring between the lot of us - which
is particularly disappointing in the
case of the heterosexuals here
present -
TOM

Well, don't look at me: I've asked
hundreds of people. (He points out
various girls) I've asked her and
her - I asked her twice - and her
sister.

SCARLETT
You haven't asked me.

TOM
Haven't I?

SCARLETT
No.

TOM
Well, yes, I mean, of course,
Scarlett, would you like...you
84

TOM (cont'd)
know...I haven't got much to offer,

but erm...
SCARLETT
No thanks, Tom. But nice of you to
ask.
TOM

No, any time.

GARETH

Be that as it may - I want to set
you a challenge - find husbands and
wives. Weddings are the ideal time
for it. Matthew and I are in a
slightly special position, and we
will try to entertain the Americans
- but the rest of you - please -
conjugate! I'd like to go to the
wedding of someone I really loved
for a change.

TOM
Fair enough - I'm game. What about
you Fifi - spot a potential hubby in
the throng?

FIONA
Fuck off, Tom.

TOM
Quite right.

SCARLETT
I'm game. I can see 4 or 5
candidates.

A champagne tray comes round.

GARETH
A toast before we head into battle -
to true love - in whatever shape or
form it comes. May all of us in our
dotage be proud to say " I was
adored once too."

ALL
True love.

GARETH
Right - as David Bowie said so
brilliantly before he went
completely off the rails - "Let's
dance!".

 
 

}

 

85

GARETH rubs his hands in glee - he's going to misbehave -
we can see that MATTHEW actually loves this in him.

DAVID
You. presumably won't ursuin
this with particular relish.
CHARLES
No. I think I'll just sit here and

wait for my wife to find me.

DAVID raises an eyebrow and walks away - CHARLES sits down
on his own near a large stuffed warrior. A voice comes
from behind him...

HENRIETTA
Hello, Charles.

CHARLES
0, Hen, no please - I couldn't bear
a scene today. I know I'm a total
shite, I deserve repeated torture...

HENRIETTA
Did I behave that atrociously last
time?

CHARLES

Do you remember when we were on holiday
in the Caribbean and I got attacked by that
enormous stingray...?

HENRIETTA
Yes.

CHARLES
It was worse.

She laughs. She is in a good playful mood - you can now
see why they might have once gone out - they are
comfortable as old boyfriend and girlfriend.

CHARLES
Christ, I'm depressed ~ how are you?

HENRIETTA
Well, cheerful actually - I've got
a divine new boyfriend who is over
there (cutaway to her good looking
boyfriend) and I weigh almost
nothing.

CHARLES
Yes, you look wonderful... Perhaps
you were right, Hen - perhaps we
should have got married.
 

86

HENRIETTA
Absolutely not - you'll never marry
anyone, Charles. What you are is a
serial monogamist: kind and lovely -
but always in transit...

CHARLES
I'm sure I could change: right girl,
right railway station...

HENRIETTA
And besides - marry you and you have
to marry your friends - and I'm not
sure I could take Fiona.

 

CHARLES
Fiona loves you..
HENRIETTA :
Fiona calls me the Attractive
Duck...
CHARLES
Does she? So all round - I'm nota
good bet
HENRIETTA
No - nice for a year, but...
CHARLES
Thanks for that, Hen - I was

depressed, but you've really cheered
me up. I think I'll go die now.

HENRIETTA
Please come and have lunch sometime
- ring me... (pecks him gently on
the cheek)... Still cute.

(Disappointed) Ah. (He takes a big
gulp of drink) Good Lord, I seem to

excuse me...

GARETH returns.

GARETH
How's it going - any rings on any
fingers?

FIONA

No - but there's a charming man over
there with no hair who I think might
be a contender.

GARETH
It's a bit of a nightmare out there
- Matthew's trapped with an
evangelist from Minnesota.

CUT TO:

MATTHEW with a man with a stars and stripes waistcoat: he
has his eyes closed and his hand on Matthew's shoulder. He
may be exorcising him. MATTHEW looks quizzical.

FREDERICK — THE BEST MAN (v/o)
Ladies and gentiemen - please charge

your glasses. First, rather
unusually, we have a word from the
bride.

Enthusiastic applause - particularly from GARETH.

GARETH
Excellent. I love this girl.

CHARLES looks up at GARETH - who shrugs his shoulders - he
knows Charles's secret.

CARRIE and HAMISH are at the end, on a sort of raised
platform.

 
89

CARRIE
Thank you. Forgive me if I'm a
- little hesitant - the last really
important speech I made was to ny
mother and father explaining exactly
what a packet of condoms were doing
in my bedside table.

LAUGHTER
CARRIE (cont)

I really only want to say 3 things.
The first is how overjoyed I am to
see all of you here - I would have
thought that not living in the same
country was a perfect excuse for not
turning up to a wedding - and yet
here you Americans are. Thank you.
And as for the locals - I would have
thought the fact that lots of
frightful Americans were flying in
was the perfect excuse for staying
away - so thank you too.

: CHARLES looks at her with affection

, CARRIE (cont)

Point number 2 is a private thing
between me and my sister - I always
told you I'd tell you on my wedding
day - and the answer is - yes, I did
- 3 times - and I'm really sorry.

The third point is the important one
- if my. darling Dad had been here
today, he would have been speaking
now - and I know what he would have
said - "cute dress, babe, but why
the hell are you marrying the stiff
in the skirt?"

TOM roars with laughter - he's very impressed at her cheek.

CARRIE (cont)
And I would have given him the same

answer I give you - ‘because I love
him.' As John Lennon, who died the
same year as ny Dad, said - "Love is

the answer - and you know that for
sure". I do know - and I'm sure.

They all clap as she sits down. CHARLES can't believe he
let her go.

CHARLES
This is the last wedding I'm going
i to - I mean it.

 
 

90

DAVID quietly pats his brother's shoulder. Now the
applause dies down and CARRIE just gets to her feet again.

CARRIE
oO, final thing - someone here asked
me to marry them last week - and the
answer is - ‘yeh, okay, if this
doesn't work out'.

It's an outrageous thing to say, and HAMISH roars with

laughter. CHARLES looks at her.

FREDERICK - THE BEST MAN
Splendid. And now, my Lords, Ladies
and gents, my dear friend and yours,
Mr Hamish Banks.

CHARLES shakes his head in dismay. HAMISH is
confident in his years and social position.
_ DAVID
Imean, how old is he? 2,000, 3,000
years o1d?
HAMISH

Anyone involved in Conservative
politics over the past 20 years has
got used to being upstaged by a
woman. But I didn't expect it to
happen on my wedding day. That
said, it couldn't have been done by
a more wonderful woman, one by whom
I am quite happy to be upstaged for
the rest of my life.

Loud "Bravo!". In the background there is a
clatter.

GARETH has stumbled backwards.
CUT BACK TO:

HAMISH (cont'd)

First, I'd like to extend ny
compliments to the bridesmaids - and

it is a political speech after all!

Most of the audience are still listening to him, and most
laugh. CHARLES moves to GARETH. DAVID and TOM are with
him.
CHARLES
We're going to need a Doctor. Ton.

DAVID cradles GARETH's head on his knee. The fuss at the
back is now discreet.

All right - leave it to me.

TOM is suddenly another version of himself - responsible,
caring - this is how he will be with his family, on his

stern old building took on a look of

HAMISH (cont'd)
flushed youth today - more I fear
than can be said for the bridegroom.

Everyone laughs.

80. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 80.

This is the room they have moved Gareth to. It is huge and
empty. There is a sharp contrast between the two rooms -
one absolutely packed and full of laughter, the other
still, with six small figures alone in a big space. We see
GARETH's fabulous waistcoat being unbuttoned. FIONA,
DAVID, CHARLES, TOM are there.

CHARLES
Is he going to be all right?

THE DOCTOR looks at him, with no hope in his face.
8 NT. SCOTTIS R USE. Cc: ON. NIGHT. 81.

HAMISH (cont'd)
...twice her age, half her brains..

Big roar of laughter. Powerful music plays.
2. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIG! 82.

In the room next door something has happened. It is like
a tableau. FIONA is trying desperately not to cry. TOM is
standing with his hands behind his neck. DAVID is holding
GARETH'S head. There is a kerfuffle at the door and
SCARLETT sprints inelegently into the room, runs towards
them and slips across the polished wooden floor, like on
ice.

83.INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. EPTION. NIGHT. 83.

We see CHARLES, his face white, walking through the crowds
of people laughing. HAMISH still talking in the
background...

HAMISH

I looked in the mirror this morning
when I was shaving, and I thought to
myself - I must learn to shave
without looking in the mirror.
However - if as the years go by I
can look in the mirror and see my
beautiful bride behind me - then
I'll put up with anything...

CHARLES sees MATTHEW and walks towards him. Just before he
reaches him, he hesitates - it's a hard moment.
 

93
84. INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. NIGHT. 84.
The tableau in the other room.
85. INT. SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE. REC: ON. NIGHT. 5.

The end of CHARLES'S hesitation. He moves forward, takes
MATTHEW's arm, and whispers in his ear.

CUT AWAY as we take in MATTHEW's reaction to the news.

86. EXT. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 86.

Dramatic shots of the Lake District, in all its ill-
tempered winter beauty. After 30 seconds, we see CHARLES'
car driving. It turns the corner.

87. EXT. FUNERA: CH. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 87.

There, in the middle of the mountains, stands a rough stone
chapel. Outside it are parked lots of cars. CHARLES is
last again. SCARLETT and he both get out and walk swiftly.
SCARLETT is dressed all in black, except for pink shoes.

CHARLES
So: I' os

DAVID
Don't worry. We told you the wrong
time. It starts _in ten minutes.
You're early.

CHARLES

Thanks. Tom. Good to see you.

TOM
Wonderful to see you, Charles, as
always. Darling Scarlett.

SCARLETT's face just creases with sorrow. TOM seems to
have changed into a slightly different figure, still
foolish, but a good member of the community.

88. INT. FUNERAL CHURCH. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 88.
They all walk in together. CHARLES sees MATTHEW.

CHARLES
I'm sorry I'm late.

MATTHEW
Not at all - Gareth would have been
deeply wounded if you'd broken a
lifetime's tradition.
 

, 94

CHARLES moves past many faces we recognise: ANGUS, LYDIA,
BERNARD, LAURA and more. We also see some older people.
University colleagues - and two slightly meek, older
people, understood to be Gareth's parents.

CHARLES sees that CARRIE is there, in the far corner of the
church. She looks plain, un-made up - a beautiful but
rather startling contrast to the high flush of her wedding
day. But CHARLES sits where TOM gently guides him, next to
FIONA. DAVID slips in next to him...

Music begins to play. The service begins. The coffin is
there, in the middle of the aisle. The music comes to an
end. The local PRIEST speaks. .

PRIEST
Before I begin, I have asked Matthew
to say a few words.

MATTHEW steps forward. He has a few papers.

MATTHEW
Gareth used to prefer funerals to
weddings. He said it was easier to
get enthusiastic about a ceremony
one at least had an outside chance
of eventually being involved in.

Everyone laughs, they are immediately at ease. CHARLES
discreetly signs MATTHEW'S words for DAVID.

In order to do my research for this
speech I rang round to get a general
picture of how Gareth was regarded
by those who met him. "Fat" seems
to be a word people most connected
with him. I rang a couple of
libraries and asked if they
remembered him. "No." - "He was
fat..." - "O yes, of course!".
"Terribly rude" also rang a lot of
bells. When I told the emotional
Italian in our local sandwich shop
that Gareth was dead, his first
reaction was "Thank God for that" —
before, of course, bursting into
tears and closing the shop to mourn.
So, "very rude and very fat" seems
to have been the stranger's
viewpoint. And I'm sure the maker
of his waistcoats would like me to
add "very demanding and, of course,
quite mad".

On the other hand, some of you have
been kind enough to ring me, and

 
 

95

MATTHEW (cont'd)

tell me that you loved him - which
I know he would have been thrilled
to hear. Your remember his fabulous
hospitality and his strange,
experimental cooking - the recipe
for Duck a la Banana fortunately
goes with him to his grave. Most of
all, you tell me of his enormous
capacity for joy, and when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness. His
full bass version of "Shaddupa Ya
Face" is something we will all,
tragically, never forget. But I
hope joyful is how you will remember
hin. Not stuck in a box in a
church. Pick your favourite of his
waistcoats and then remember him
that way: the most splendid,
replete, gaudily dressed, weak-
hearted as it turned out, and jolly
bugger most of us ever met.

As for me, you may ask how I will
remember him, what I thought of hin,
and, ‘unfortunately, there I fall
rather short of words. Perhaps
you'll forgive me if I turn for ny
own feelings to the words of another
splendid bugger, W.H.Auden...

He recites a poem by Auden. At first he modestly reads it,
and then looks up and speaks it, not consulting the paper

in front of him.

Cut aways during the poem should include

GARETH'S parents - it would be nice to feel they understand
MATTHEW.

This is actually what I want to say:

"Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone.
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone.

Silence the pianos and with muffled drum

Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead

Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead,
Put the crepe bows round the white necks of the public

doves,

Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West

My working week and my Sunday rest

My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song,
I thought that love would last for ever:

I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now: put out every one
 

96

MATTHEW (cont 'd)
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood
For nothing now can ever come to any good".

A long silence as MATTHEW folds his piece of paper. As he
goes and sits down, a little child cries out, fed up.

MATTHEW
Quite right.

CUT TO FIONA reading the lesson.

FIONA

If I speak with the tongues of men
and angels, but have not love, I am
become a sounding brass, or a
clanging cymbal. And if I have the
gift of prophecy, and know all
mysteries and all knowledge; and if
I have all faith, so as to remove
mountains, but have not love - I am
nothing.

CUT TO CHARLES translating the last sentence for DAVID.
They both know how true it is.

89 -_FUN: CHURCH. DISTRICT. DAY. 89.

People are kissing and getting back into their cars. DAVID
leaves CHARLES and walks away with SERENA. SCARLETT comes
up to CHARLES.

SCARLETT
I'm going back with David.

CHARLES nods. As SCARLETT walks away, she comes across
FIONA, who puts her arm over SCARLETT'S shoulder. Then
SCARLETT slips an arm round FIONA'S waist. It is the first
time we've seen them affectionate.

CARRIE approaches CHARLES...

CHARLES
It was good of you to come - must
have been the shortest honeymoon in
history.

CARRIE

No, it's fine. We're going to take
it some other time.

Pause: there are things to say.

That thing you said in the street...
 

97

CHARLES
I'm sorry about that - it was the
tea,... tea always.. - it's like LSD
with me, I don't know what I'm
doing.

CARRIE
No - I liked it. I liked you saying
it.

CHARLES

Well, likewise your speech - I'll
hold you to it.

CARRIE
Okay.

Long pause.
I'd better be going.

CHARLES
Yes. . Bye.

He puts out his hand - to shake — but she comes forward and
kisses him - it is awkward like two uncomfortable lovers...
Then she walks away.
FIONA
Walk, Charlie?
CHARLES
Yes. That would be lovely.

90. EXT. NEAR FUNERAL CHURCH. LAKE DISTRICT. DAY. 90.
FIONA and CHARLES are overlooking the hills.

FIONA

You like that girl, don't you?
CHARLES

Yes - yes - it's a strange thing

when at last it happens.

He looks at her with truth - without irony - then shakes
his head.

What about you, Fifi - when are you
going to show your cards?

FIONA
O, really they're there for all to
see. I've been in love with the

same bloke for ages.
 

CHARLES
Who's that?
Pause.
FIONA
(Very casually) You, Charles. It's
always been you, since first we met,
o so many years ago.

He is sad, perplexed. She takes a puff on her cigarette.

FIONA
I knew the first. moment. Across the
crowded room - or lawn, in fact.

Pause for another puff.

Doesn't matter. Nothing either of
us can do on this one. Such is
life.

She looks straight at him. She's calm, glad to have said
it. He looks out, still confused. Then turns and looks at
her thoughtfully - she is calmly surveying the scene ahead.
Pause.

FIONA
"Friends" isn't bad, you know.
Friends is quite something.

CHARLES
Yes...So what do we do? Let our
parents decide who we should marry?
Take the first girl and boy coming
over the hill?

FIONA
No, but perhaps, you know, change
the goalposts - look for something
different - look for someone we can
live with, rather than someone we

adore.

TOM
Hello, you chaps. Not butting in am
I?

FIONA

(Almost tenderly) No, come on, Tom.
They get up and begin to stride.

TOM
Gosh, that was some display, wasn't
it - never felt like that - I mean,
something vaguely similar for Jilly
when I was young...

 
 

CHARLES looks for explanation. FIONA explains...

FIONA
Labrador.

TOM
In a way I think it's hardest for
the parents, don't you? I hope I
die before ny children.

CHARLES
Tom - one thing I find really
touching is your total confidence
you will get married. What if you
never find the right girl?

TOM

Well I don't know, Charlie, truth is
- unlike you, I've never expected
the thunderbolt - always hoped I'd
just meet some nice, friendly girl,
like the look of her, hope the look
of me doesn't make her physically
sick - then pop the question and
settle down and be happy.

CHARLES and FIONA exchange a look - maybe he's right.

It worked for my parents..well,
apart from the divorce and all that.

CHARLES
Dear Tom, you're very wise. I give
you six months at the outside.
Don't want the responsibilities of
Best Man: but can I be chief usher?

TOM
Dear fellow. That would be
splendid.
And, as they walk on...

TOM (cont'd)
I shall miss Gareth most awfully.

++.an alarm clock rings.

Ql. INT. _C LESS '_ BEDROOM. DAY. 91.
CU the alarm clock ringing.

Caption: 20 months later.

A hand comes up. And slams the clock off. We follow the
arm down. It belongs to CHARLES: he's slept in his shirt
and trousers. He rolls over and hugs a figure in bed next
to him. A shout, and TOM sits up in bed.

TOM
What the hell's going on?

CHARLES
(Waking) O my God

He looks towards the clock

Tom, I think it's time to get
dressed.

CUT TO two white shirts: one hung up - the other scrunched
into a pile in the middle of socks. Two hands picking then
up.

cur TO TOM putting braces over his shoulders in a sprightly
manner.

CUT TO CHARLES, giving up on braces and putting a belt
round his trousers.

CUT TO TOM taking black shoes out of a box: they are new
and beautifully shone.

CUT TO CHARLES reaching into a pile of old gymshoes. He
finally finds his black shoes - they are mud-filthy.

CHARLES
Excellent.
92. INT. KITCHEN. CHARLES'S HOUSE. DAY 92.

TOM, looking crisp, enters.

MATTHEW
Ah, Thomas, bravo - are we ready for
the big day?

TOM
I think we are. How do I look?
 

 

101

MATTHEW
Divine. Scarlett, I think you better
get up - the service begins in an
hour.

A voice from under the kitchen table

SCARLETT
Here I come - ready in 11 seconds.

It's clearly a lie. Her naked leg drifts out from under
the table.

TOM
Splendid waistcoat, Matthew.
MATTHEW

Thank you - a good tradition, I
think. :

For MATTHEW is wearing one of GARETH's old waistcoats.

TOM
God - if people knew how much
organisation goes into weddings,
no-one would ever get spliced.

Enter DAVID - in wedding trousers and a white shirt.

MATTHEW
Ah, time for the champagne, I think
- there we go - let us toast the
groon.

TOM
Splendid, absolutely splendid.

They take glasses. Enter CHARLES, chaotic - messed hair,
one brace on, shirt untucked.

CHARLES
Sorry I'm late, trying to clean
these bloody shoes.

MATTHEW
We were just about to have a toast.
Ladies and gentlemen - the Groom.

And they all turn towards CHARLES: all with beaming smiles.

CHARLES
Thanks - can I have a glass too -
I'm dying of thirst. How's my chief
usher?
 

. . 102
TOM gives him his traditional double thumbs up.

TOM
Ticketty-boo.

93. INT. ROOM IN PRIVATE HOUSE. DAY. 93.
A fantasy of flowers, petticoats, bridesmaids in dresses.
Clearly the bride is being prepared. We see hands,
flowers, lace - but not the bride's face.

94. INT. KITCHEN. CHARLES'S HOUSE. DAY. 94.

 

The breakfast table - they're all seated, with lots of
burnt toast.

MATTHEW
Only a few hours from now, I'm going
to be standing up and making a
speech about what a wonderful day
this is for this unbe-fucking-
lievably perfect couple.

ALL
Bravo!!! Fine turn of phrase!

MATTHEW :
But here, amongst friends, I'm sure
we'd all agree that it's time for a
little more honesty.

CHARLES
Shame.

MATTHEW
I for one had totally given up on
Charles getting married. I thought
- the only way for him ever tying
the knot would be to team up with
some equally desperate ex, and make
the best of a bad job.

CHARLES
Your honour I object.

MATTHEW
Either that - or he'd marry someone
for their looks and accept the fact
that he's basically married to us
lot - the only problem being we
refuse to have his babies.

TOM
I don't know about that...
 

103

MATTHEW
And the truth of the matter is -
he's gone and done both - settled
for some desperately attractive
desperate ex.

ALL
Bravo!

MATTHEW
And we all wish you the best of
luck, you tragic sad act...

95. INT. ROOM IN PRIVATE HOUSE. DAY. 95.

HENRIETTA smiles.

The kitchen table - and CHARLES replying on his own behalf.

CHARLES
Well, I'd like to thank Matthew for
' that charming tribute to myself and
1 my future wife. I wonder if I can
just pass on to you before the day
' starts a little private message from
' her to you all:

TOM
oO, this is exciting.
'
CHARLES
She says - "any of you come near our

house, I'll set the dogs on you"

ALL
Bravo!!!
 

104

CHARLES

As you know, the passage to the
altar has not been the most peaceful
for me and Hen - but in the end, for
all my imperfections, she took me
with no conditions at all apart from
the fact that I shouldn't be late to
the service - so I reckon it's a
pretty good deal. What time is it
by the way...

MATTHEW
10.45

CHARLES
Jesus - we're meant to be there!!!
Why didn't anyone tell me?

MATTHEW
Please, dear boy, don't panic - we
made allowances. .

CHARLES
What. .?

A very noisy sound from above. He looks out the window.
A helicopter is landing.

CHARLES (cont)
++. the hell is that?

SCARLETT
(with a huge grin)
Don't worry. Tom paid.

Huge grin from TOM.
7. EXT. ROO: LES & S 'S HOUSE. DAY. 97.

They are all climbing up on to the roof, with the
helicopter above, CHARLES signs to DAVID....

CHARLES
By the way, it's really noisy.

8. EXT. WEDDING 4. - LONDON. DAY. 98.

A beautiful, large London Church. As they approach, TOM
grabs CHARLES by the shoulder.

TOM
I just want to_ say, before
everything, how deeply honoured I am
to be your usher.
 

105

CHARLES
You're welcome, Tom. After all, it
was you who introduced us all those
long complicated years ago.

TOM
No, but really. I'm glad to be your
friend.

CHARLES
(Touched)
Thank you.

TOM immediately loses the intimate moment, and drifts off
back into his cheerful old mood.

TOM
And actually, I'm pretty damned
delighted to get an invitation to
anything these days. You see, my
damn relatives keep marrying each
other - so I get half as many
invites as normal people.

They catch up with the others. MATTHEW in organising mode.

MATTHEW
Okay troops - gather ye round - one
last go through before the horrible
hordes begin to gather. And George
- over here.

GEORGE
Splendid - just hope me damn sister
turns up, that's all!!!
It is he, from the cab and the Boatman - he's Henrietta's
brother. While the boys gather, with SCARLETT, who has
actually dressed in tails, FIONA arrives.
FIONA
CHARLES
Fifi.
They have been through their own war.

FIONA
You see that I am wearing black.

CHARLES
O yes, so you are.
 

106

FIONA
But tomorrow, I'll be all the
colours of the rainbow. Think I'll
go find someone who fancies me for
a change.

She smiles - it is all right. TOM approaches in his formal
capacity.
TOM
Right, let's get going. Fiona,
bride or groom?

FIONA
O fuck off, Thomas.

CUT TO: 5 minutes later

The guests are starting to arrive. SCARLETT stands next to
CHARLES. Then she screams. She has spied her tall
American - she rushes up to him, and jumps up, with her
legs around his waist.

MATTHEW
Unusual behaviour for an usher.

CUT TO:

ANGUS and LAURA from the first wedding arriving with twins.
Followed by LYDIA and. BERNARD.

CHARLES
(To Angus)
I had no idea!

ANGUS
Neither did bloody I - for heaven's
sake - it's ridiculous.

LAURA
O ignore him - he adores them - you
should see him with them in the
bath.

Behind her back, ANGUS mimes a drowning motion.
ANGUS
(whispering as he passes)
The thing is to make it look like an
accident.
They keep arriving.

LYDIA
We've got a lovely gift for you.
 

107
CHARLES
Can't wait. As long as it isn't
another salad bowl, T'll be
thrilled.

They both laugh very naturally at this. CHARLES moves
away. Their faces fall in grief.

LYDIA

Honestly Bernard! (imitating her
husband) "He always loved salad!"

99. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 99.
MATTHEW with CHARLES's mad OLD MAN.

MATTHEW
Bride or groom?

OLD MAN
It should be perfectly obvious that
I'm neither.
MATTHEW is sweetly tolerant.

MATTHEW
If you'd like to sit here, sir.

OLD MAN
Anywhere I can see the screen.

He is sat down next to a MIDDLE AGED LADY.
OLD MAN
Love Schwarzenegger - go anywhere to
see one of his films.

He takes out his glasses and looks eagerly towards the
altar.

TOM at the door with a sweet-looking, slightly awkward
girl.

TOM
Bride or groom?

DEIRDRE
Bride.

He looks at her - it is love at first sight.
 

108

TOM
Ahm, yes. Fine. You know, I've got
a feeling we've met before.

DEIRDRE
We have - about 25 years ago. I'm
second cousin Harold's daughter,
Deirdre. You're Tom.

TOM
Good lord. So you're family.

DEIRDRE
Yes.

Love is in their eyes.

DEIRDRE
But very distant.

TOM
Well, yes, of course. You said you
were... ‘bride’.

DEIRDRE
Yes.

TOM
Yes. Well, do sit, do sit here,
Deirdre. .

He walks away, dazed.

TOM
Golly. Thunderbolt City.

TOM walks past CHARLES - CHARLES look up - and there
walking towards him is CARRIE,. very quietly dressed.
Beautiful.

CARRIE
Hi.
CHARLES
Hello.
CARRIE

You look lovely: but then, as you
know, I always liked you in wedding
gear.

CHARLES smiles

CARRIE
And on time.
109

CHARLES
It's an extraordinary thing.

She smiles. So does he. They're happy with this.

CHARLES
How's Hamish?
CARRIE
O he's fine...I believe.
CHARLES
You believe?
CARRIE
Yes. (pause) Wasn't the man for me
after all.
CHARLES
(worried)

You left him?

CARRIE
We left each other. It was
charming. Very polite. Fine (she's
just a little precarious now)

CHARLES
When?

CARRIE
O, a year or so. Yes. March was
hell. By April it was sorted.

(trying to make light of it) That's
absolutely the last time I. marry
someone twice my father's age.

MATTHEW interrupting - it's all go.

MATTHEW
Time to travel, Charles...

CHARLES
(distracted) Yes, yes... (then
polite) Coming, good. (To Carrie)
Why didn't you get in touch with me?

| CARRIE
i Well, you know, I did think about
it. Wanted to... but I was in a

state...

She clearly has remembered him intensely. But she gathers
herself.
. 110

CARRIE (cont)
...-Then I heard about this - so I
thought better not. (And now she's
breezy again) Anyway, mustn't hold
you up - see you afterwards - though
I fear that once again, we'll have
to break our lovely tradition.

CHARLES
Yes, fine, excellent.

She smiles and walks away. CHARLES is stunned.

CHARLES
No...

He may be about to say something very important - but no...

CHARLES
.-.-let me show you to your seat...
(passing Matthew) I'm just showing
her to her seat.

They walk along in silence for a few seconds, down the
aisle. They reach the end of the pew - then, just before
turning into it:

CHARLES (cont)
You probably should have = rung.
Despite what you heard. .

CARRIE
Should I?

CHARLES
Yes. Yes, you should.

This is a restatement of his love for her.

CARRIE
Our timing really has been bad,
hasn't it?

CHARLES
It's been bad.

CARRIE
It's been a disaster. (She loves him
too)

CHARLES
It has, as you say, been very bad
indeed. God, it's lovely to see
you.

PAUSE
 

111

CARRIE
Thank you. Good luck. It's pretty
easy - just say 'I do' whenever
anyone asks you a question.

CHARLES
Thanks.

CHARLES walks away and meets MATTHEW.

MATTHEW
Shall we leave the ushing to the
ushers and take our positions up
front.

CHARLES
Yes - look, just give me a second
will you, Matthew?

..-It's clearly not all over.

MATTHEW
Certainly, freshen up at will.

102. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. CORRIDOR. DAY. 102.

He walks down a corridor in this big church - and opens a
door - there are the choir, all warming up...

CHOIR .
Love Divine, All Loves Excelling!!!

CHARLES
Sorry.

He heads out and goes in the next door. It is two nuns,
who look at him angrily.

He goes back into the corridor.
103. INT. WEDDING 4. C) C! VESTRY. DAY. 103.

Then he enters the next room. It is a big, beautiful,
empty ecclesiastical room. He goes in and shuts the door.

CHARLES
Dear Lord - I ask you to forgive me
for what I am about to say in this
magnificent place of worship.
Bugger! Bugger! Bugger! Bugger!
Bugger!

After each 'bugger', cut to another slightly surprised
looking religious icon - The Virgin Mary, The Crucifix, and
a final one which should be exceptionally angry,
disapproving, or is a man being pricked by forks in hell.
 

112

CHARLES
Bugger!

A very sweet-natured verger pops his head out from behind
a curtain where he has been washing his hands.

VERGER
Can I help at all?

CHARLES
No thanks. No, no, fine, just
letting off some steam.

VERGER
Excellent - often do the same myself
- not exactly the same vocabulary
obviously. Rather more 'blasts' and
‘bothers'. I'll leave you.

104. INT. WEDDING 4. C! - 04.
GUESTS arriving. Now down to the last seats. SCARLETT
guides someone into a position right flat totally behind a
pillar.
SCARLETT
It's not as bad as it looks, if you
bend a little. (It's a lie).

Panning across we glimpse CARRIE, looking sérious. A tadge
vulnerable, with no idea what is going on.

MATTHEW heading down the corridor, opening the same series

Then, in the next room, the nuns.

MATTHEW

NUN

Then MATTHEW reaches the third room and there is CHARLES -
lying on an ancient grave in an alcove.

MATTHEW
(totally calm)
Ah, Charles, good to see you.

CHARLES

Hello Matthew. What was the name of
that low budget sci-fi film, 1980's,
where the hero had a watch which
sort of slowed down time - so he
could run around at real _ speed,
while everyone else was in slow
motion.

MATTHEW
O yes, I remember. Damn - yes.
Good film.

CHARLES
Very good film.

MATTHEW
Not "The Hidden"?

CHARLES
No. One word title..."Trancers",
that was it.
. 114

MATTHEW
That's it - that's the _ baby.
Excellent film. What about it?

CHARLES
Well, you haven't got one of those
watches have you?

MATTHEW
Not actually on me at the moment.
Why?

CHARLES

I need time to think.
107. EXT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 107.

The front gate of the church. HENRIETTA emerges, beautiful
in her dress, with her FATHER in attendance.

108. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. VESTRY. DAY. 108.
CHARLES and MATTHEW in the Vestry

CHARLES
It's just...what do you think about
marriage?

MATTHEW
Excellent - if you love the ‘person.

CHARLES
Well quite. All these weddings -
all these years + here I am on my
own wedding day, and I'n
still....thinking.

MATTHEW
Can I ask what about?

CHARLES
No, I think best not.

109. EXT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 109.
TOM heading off HENRIETTA and her FATHER
TOM
Yes, I'm terribly sorry - we've got
a bit of a delay: there's just a
slight problem with the flowers.

HENRIETTA
The flowers?
 

115

TOM

Well, yes. Unfortunately we seem to
have quite a few hay-fever sufferers
in the congregation, and they've
been stuck next to the damn flowers,
so we're just moving them - the
congregation, not the flowers - but
anyway, with any luck, it will be
all right in a jiffy, I'm absolutely
convinced. I'll report back
pronto...

He rushes back into the Church. HENRIETTA raises her eyes
sceptically - this chaos is rather what she expected of
Tom's ushering.

110. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 10.
TOM reaches MATTHEW and DAVID.

. MATTHEW
How are you doing?

TOM
I think I've fooled them so far.
The great advantage of having a
reputation for being stupid - people
are less suspicious of you. What's
happening?

MATTHEW
We'll have to wait and see. He's
along the corridor. He's thinking.

TOM
What about?
111. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. VESTRY. DAY. 111.

There is a knock on the door.

CHARLES
Enter.
TOM
Ah - Charles - we wondered if we

could lend a hand.

MATTHEW, TOM, DAVID enter. CHARLES smiles. SCARLETT
sneaks in behind.

SCARLETT
What's the problem, Charlie?

DAVID
What's the problem?
 

116

CHARLES
oO, look, it's really
nothing... (simultaneously to
David)... I'm fucked.

MATTHEW

Charles...(really concerned)... no
matter what it is, you can tell
us...you really can...

He looks at them - they are waiting to help him - he is
about to speak, when suddenly there is a knock on the door
- they're all terrified - 'Is it the bride?' is the basic
fear.

MATTHEW
(calling out)
Hello.
The VICAR enters
VICAR

Hello. Thought I'd come in and
shove on the gear. You chaps having
a final smoke, are you, before the

proceedings?
MATTHEW
Yes, sort of spiritually speaking.
VICAR :
Well, don't be too long - the
bride'll think you don't want to

marry her.

They exchange glances - at the last moment, defeated by
politeness and etiquette. The VICAR talks away, while
CHARLES signs to DAVID.. :

VICAR (V/O CHARLES & DAVID's conversation)
Seeing you all in here reminds me of
a terrible time, I had a groom who
had rather overdone it with the
alcohol the day before, and found he
couldn't help throwing up into the
font. Problem was, no-one knew, and
the next Saturday, someone rather
carelessly filled it up with water
for a Christening without checking
inside. No wonder the poor blighter
cried when he got dunked.

What we're watching is CHARLES talking to DAVID...

. DAVID
Give me an update.
 

They

112.

117

CHARLES
This is _so embarrassing...

DAVID
I_was with you the day you wet
yourself during the school Carol
service.

CHARLES
I__just saw __ Carrie and she's

separated and it suddenly reminded
me...

 

DAVID
QJesus. Charlie, it's your wedding
day...

CHARLES
I_know...What's your advice?
DAVID
3 choices: go ahead with it...
CHARLES
Yes...
DAVID

Go outside and say, "folks, bad news

it's all off"...

CHARLES
Not tempting...
DAVID
And...I_ can't think of a third...
CHARLES
Damn.
VICAR

Well, togs on - are we all ready to
face the enemy?

MATTHEW
Are we?

all look at CHARLES.

CHARLES
Yes. Excellent.

INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. CORRIDOR. DAY. 112.

Outside the door of the vestry - the most emotional music

plays.

The door opens. They are all standing there -

trim, smiling, ready.
 

. . 118

113. INT. WEDDING 4. CHURCH. DAY. 113.

CHARLES walks along to the top of the aisle with MATTHEW.
Meanwhile, at the back...

SCARLETT
What was that about?

TOM
Buggered if I know.

As CHARLES looks forward, the light breaks through the
stained glass windows on to CARRIE. He looks at her, and
walks on, up the aisle to his fate.

MATTHEW checks in his pocket for the rings. He pretends to
have lost them - them remembers they're in his back pocket,
with a great show of mock relief. He turns. TOM is at the
front door and gives him a thumbs up - everything is A.O.K.
for action.

The Wedding march starts.

CUT TO HENRIETTA, walking down the aisle - she looks
beautiful. Her father by her side, holding her arn.

HENRIETTA
Not so tight.

She arrives. The PRIEST steps forward. CHARLES smiles at
hin.

VICAR
Dearly beloved. We are gathered
here together in the sight of God
and in the face of this congregation
to join together this man and this
woman in holy Matrimony -

CUT TO SCARLETT absolutely totally beaming with pride - and
probably crying already.

VICAR (cont'd)
which is an honourable estate,
instituted of God in the time of
man's innocence, signifying unto us
the mystical union that is betwixt
Christ and his Church...

CUT TO ANGUS and LAURA

and therefore is not by any to be
enterprised, nor taken in hand
unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly
119

CUT TO BERNARD and LYDIA

But reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly, and in the fear
of God. Therefore, if any man can
show any just cause why they may not
lawfully be joined together, let him
speak now, or else hereafter for
ever hold his peace.

The usual pause. Settle on CHARLES. And then there is a
knocking from behind, knuckles on wood.

CHARLES looks startled. The BRIDE looks to him alarmed.
So does MATTHEW.

CUT TO DAVID,
CHARLES.

VICAR
I'm sorry - does someone have
something to say?

who raises his hand. CUT between him and

CHARLES
I think he might. (He starts to
sign) What in the name of...
DAVID
CHARLES
What?
DAVID
Will you translate?
CHARLES
Tra: te what?
VICAR

What's going on?

CHARLES
Ahm, he's asking me if I'll
translate what he's saying.

VICAR
O excellent. What is he saying?

CHARLES
He says...( and he watches David)
‘I suspect the groom is having doubts: I
suspect the groom would like to delay. I
suspect the groom... I suspect the groom..
120

DAVID
-..rea loves someone ___else
That's the truth, isn't it Charlie?

CHARLES doesn't sign back.

DAVID (cont)
Because, Charlie - this is for the
rest of your life - in the end, if
you_marry at all - you've got to
Marry the person you totally love.

CUT TO: CHARLES and then DAVID again.

DAVID (cont)

And_by the way - your flies are
undone.

CHARLES just does a tiny look down

VICAR
What's he saying?

CHARLES
He says, he suspects that the groom
loves someone else.

VICAR
And do you? (Pause) Do you love
someone else? (Pause) Do you
Charles?

PAUSE

CUT ROUND: Everyone - SCARLETT, TOM, HENRIETTA, FIONA, THE
FATHER OF THE BRIDE. Then like someone saying his vows...

CHARLES |
I do.

The camera holds on CHARLES and then moves slowly high up
into the Church.

4. NT. KITCHEN. CHARLES & SCARLETT'S HOUSE. NIGHT.114.
Same set up as at breakfast, only 10 hours later. The
champagne bottle is still lying there. CHARLES, FIONA,
SCARLETT, DAVID, TOM, MATTHEW. Total silence. They're in
shock about what happened in church.

More silence.

SCARLETT
Blimey.

Pause
1221

TOM
(optimistically)
At least it's one we won't forget.
I mean a lot of weddings just blend
into each other, don't they, but
this is one that will really stick
out in the memory.

MATTHEW
For not actually including a wedding
service.

TOM
Well, that amongst other things.
(pause)
I'm not surprised he hit you.

CHARLES
(who has a black eye)
No, I think it was the right thing
to do.

FIONA
Poor girl.
CHARLES
O God.
TOM

Though, let's face facts - I ‘mean if
you weren't sure you wanted to marry
her today of all days, i.e. your
wedding day, it must be the right
decision, mustn't it?

FIONA turns to him to deliver her usual 'Fuck off Tom' -
then just brushes his cheek affectionately.

DAVID speaks

CHARLES
None of you happened to see...no,
nothing.

SCARLETT
It was a lovely dress though, wasn't
it. (little pause) I'm sure she'll
find it useful for parties.

DAVID
I blame myself.
: 122

ALL
(simultaneously)
No absolutely not/ No, you did the
right thing/No, you mustn't/ On the
contrary, you're the hero...

CHARLES looks up at him

CHARLES
They all blame you too.

PAUSE. A doorbell rings. They all get up, all relieved to
have an excuse to move.

ALL
(simultaneously)
I'll get it.

CHARLES
No, let me. If there's music to
face, I should be facing it...

He goes downstairs, gathers his strength and opens the
door. It is CARRIE. Full romance in the look and music of
the moment.

CARRIE
Hi.
. ‘ CHARLES
Hello.
PAUSE
CARRIE
Tell me, what was that about this
morning?

CHARLES shakes his head and looks up.
CHARLES
eee. YOu.
PAUSE
CARRIE
(seriously)
Good...although a disaster.

CHARLES
Unspeakably disastrous.

They look hard at each other and then can't resist a gentle
smile.
123

CHARLES
Come on in - it's raining...

CARRIE
No - let's stay out...

Smiling, remembering the rain conversation

CHARLES
Okay...

115. EXT. CHARLES' HOUSE. NIGHT. 115.
They stroll for a moment - then stop.
CHARLES (cont)
I want to ask you a question - a
huge question, an important
question.

CARRIE
Okay - what is it?

CHARLES
Do you think, in time, you might
possible agree....never to marry me?

CARRIE
I do.

They kiss in the rain.

THE END.
