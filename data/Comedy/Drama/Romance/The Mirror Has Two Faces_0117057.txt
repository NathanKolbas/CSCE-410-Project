FADE IN :
INT. GREGORY LARKIN'S BEDROOM - MORNING.

C.U. - RADIO/ALARM CLOCK. It reads 7:00 AM. The radio/alarm
goes off playing a BACH SONATA. Gregory's hand enters from 0S
to shut it off.

INT. ROSE MORGAN'S BEDROOM - MORNING.

C.U. - RADIO/ALARM CLOCK. It reads 7:00 AM. The radio/alarm
clock goes off playing JANIS JOPLIN'S "PIECE OF MY HEART".
Rose's hand enters from OS, to raise the volume.

CREDITS ROLL OVER MONTAGE:

As Gregory and Rose prepare for their day, WE INTERCUT
between the two, yet never revealing their faces. We hear
ROSE MORGAN IN VOICE OVER as:

- We see Gregory, after showering, methodically folding his
towels then opening his medicine cabinet where we find
perfectly ordered rows of products organized according to
their category - a row of medicines, a row of colognes, a row
of shaving products.

ROSE (V.0.)
"He bathed in sacred preparation of
the precious courtship to come ...

~ We see Rose's messy bathroom, with towels on the floor and
a cup of coffee balancing precariously on the sink.

ROSE (Cont'd)
“She anointed herself with holy,
scented oil ..."

Rose slaps on Baby Powder, choking from the dust.

- We see Gregory tip-toeing through his bedroom so as not to
disturb a BLONDE WOMAN sleeping in his bed. He opens a bureau
drawer revealing perfectly arranged, color coded socks.

ROSE (Cont'd)
" ... For him there would be no
other, for it had been written and
ordered thus ..."

~ Rose stands with her back to camera, as she struggles to
put on panty hose while the VO narrates:

ROSE (Cont'd)
",.. That She, the Queen of Heaven,
would look in sweet wonder upon only
him..."

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

- We see GREGORY LARKIN, dressed in a sports jacket and tie,
washing his coffee cup before placing it in the dishwasher.
He exits the kitchen to the hall and checks himself in an
antique mirror. He is a handsome man in his forties - round
wire rimmed glasses, thick wavy hair, well built. He exudes
control and order and intelligence.

- We see an antique vanity. Camera opens on a drawer filled
with un-opened beauty products and cosmetics as well as
packages of donuts, cookies and candies. Rose's hand reaches
in and pauses. We don't know whether she is reaching for a
lipstick or an coffee cake. Finally, the hand grabs the
coffee cake and closes the drawer. Camera follows her hand as
she places the coffee cake into a tote bag filled with books
and notebooks. Camera angles on the double mirror atop the
messy vanity to reveal ROSE MORGAN as she looks at herself.
Slightly overweight by today's standards, she wears no make-
up and a formless dress. Her mousy brown stringy hair hangs
straight in a blunt cut so she can run her hands through it
when she talks excitedly. Rose is a funny, vibrant,
intelligent woman in her forties, who clearly spends her
passions on ideas instead of appearances - partly out of
necessity. Beauty has never been a quality anyone attributed
to Rose. As she sits gazing at her reflection, ‘wondering if
she should fix herself up any further, WE HEAR HER VOICE OVER:

ROSE (Cont'd; V.0.)
"For they had spoken the word ... And

the word they had spoken was a word
of desire ... "

She waves her hand at her reflection in a carefree manner as
if to say, “Why bother?". She exits.

cuT TO:
EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY.
A beautiful fall day. The beginning of the school year.
ROSE (V.0.)
"Before the open door he cried out -
“Open thy heart My Lady, Open thy
Heart' ...
INT. ENGLISH & LITERATURE DEPT. - DAY.
Classes are in session. The hallway is quiet. We pass

classrooms with small signs on the windows ; THE
EXISTENTIALISTS LT134 ... HEMINGWAY, FACT OR FICTION?

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

LT136 ... HENRY JAMES, PORTRAIT OF AN ERA LT 138 ...
ROSE (V.0.)

"Tnanna appeared shining before him

like the light of the moon ... "

Our Camera reaches the classroom entitled "LOVE STORIES; FROM
STAR CROSSED LOVERS TO FATAL ATTRACTIONS " LT. 140.

INT. ROSE MORGAN'S CLASS ~ DAY

Camera pans the students who are captivated by Rose, reading
in front of the room.

ROSE (0.S.)
"Tnanna spoke: As for me, the young
woman - Who will plow my high field
... Who will plow my wet ground ...
Who will plow my holy vulva!"
(comments)
Isn't that great?!

The students laugh. Camera pans to front of the the room.

ROSE (Cont'd)
“He replied, "Queen of Heaven, I,
Dumuzi, will! ... Inanna commanded -
“Then plow my vulva, man of my heart!

The class laughs as we arrive on ROSE MORGAN - standing on a
desk, reading aloud from a book. Behind her hangs a map of
Ancient Sumeria.

ROSE (Cont'd)

Wouldn't it be wonderful to say that
to a man!? I have a dinner date
tonight, maybe I'll work it into the
conversation during dessert ...

(play-acts)
"tT was thinking that maybe after
coffee you'd like to come home and
plow my holy vulva."

The class acts more like an audience at a comedy club. Rose
is full of enthusiasm and love for her students.

CONTINUED:

The class

ROSE (Cont'd)

It's not really a date though. He's
not my type - but he's been asking me
for months so I figured the only way
to get rid of him was to actually go
out with him.

(big laughs)

(continues reciting)
"He shaped my loins with his fair
hands..He filled my lap with cream
and milk..." O000000... "He laid me
down on the fragrant honey~bed"
«+.Don't you love that?! ... "My
honey~man sweetens me always ... He
is the one my womb loves best ...
Tongue playing, one by one ... My
fair Dumuzi did so fifty times"...

(closes book)
FIFTY TIMES. You've got to love the
guy! Inanna is considered by many to
the first love story ever written -
A Sumerian epic dated around 2000
B.C. And as you will see in many
Goddess mythologies, our players will
consist of an older female with a
beautiful younger male whose sole
purpose was to serve the divine womb!
Now, looking over some of the more
modern love mythologies ~ including
recent film - I want a comparative
essay examining how the male/female
roles have shifted and I want the
title of the essay to be - WHAT THE
HELL HAPPENED?!

breaks up with laughter.

CUT TO:

INT. GREGORY LARKIN'S CLASSROOM - DAY.

GREGORY LARKIN teaches a room full of students. He is
extremely awkward and pedantic as a teacher. The atmosphere
of this classroom is a stark contrast to Rose's.

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

Camera pans the rows of bored students trying hard to receive
the lesson, while others have given up entirely.

Some of the female students, however, are very interested,
albeit in Gregory's butt as he paces the floor, reading from
a text book. Their eyes never rise above his waist.

GREGORY
Socrates states "If measure and
symmetry...

Camera on a student yawning...

GREGORY (Cont'd; 0.S.)
are absent from any composition...

An epidemic begins as another student catches the yawning
bug...and then another...and another as Gregory continues 0.Ss.

GREGORY (Cont'd; 0.8.)
-+.in any degree, ruin awaits both
the ingredients and the composition.

Camera angles on the various kinds of yawns each student
creates - wide yawns, small yawns, double yawns, triple
yawns...

GREGORY (Cont'd; 0.S.)
Measure and symmetry are beauty and
virtue the world over." Now what he
is saying here?

Gregory looks to his class and, together with every student,
YAWNS. There is complete silence as everyone participates.

cUuT TO:
INT. BLOOMINGDALES COSMETICS DEPT. - LATE AFTERNOON.

Camera captures a variety of images - various women being
"“made~over" by cosmetic saleswomen. Giant display ads of
models with perfect skin and perfect hair caressing skin
lotion and perfume ... And mirrors - everywhere - to
illuminate the faults in every potential customer's
appearance.

One of the display ads is a Gap-like-Annie Lebowitz-
celebrity-advertisement of a stunning auburn haired woman.

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

In the corner, it reads; JESSTE ARTHUR, POET/ESSAYIST for
ILLUMINATION COSMETICS.

A circular mirror on a cosmetic counter pivots down to reveal
Rose ~ looking at herself, in comparison to one of the
angelic beauties on display. Rose places her hair behind her
ears and smooths down her bangs ~ then gives up. The 0S VOICE
a SALESWOMAN from behind the counter pulls her attention.

SALESWOMAN
Can I help you?

ROSE
No. I'm just meeting someone here.

SALESWOMAN
Well, while you wait, can I show you
some of our latest lip crayons?

ROSE
No. Thank you.

SALESWOMAN
We're offering a free skin analysis
today.

ROSE
My skin's already seeing a therapist,
thanks.

SALESWOMAN

Did you know that Illuminations can
mix shades to match your - ...

ROSE
Look - I'm meeting my sister here.
She's the one shopping. I'm sure
she'll buy everything you have. But
you're wasting your time on me. I
don't wear make-up.

SALESWOMAN
{horrified)
My God. Never? Why?

ROSE
(jokes)

It doesn't work. I still look like me
only in color.

CONTINUED
CONTINUED: (2)

ROSE (Cont'd)
(calming her)
It's.all right, really. I have a
terrific personality.

CLAIRE (0.S.)
Rose?

Rose turns to find her sister CLAIRE - ten years Rose's
junior, Claire is a beautiful woman with a sinewy body and
sex kitten allure. Claire is carrying shopping bags.

EXT. CAFE ~ LATE AFTERNOON.
Rose and Claire sit and have coffee.

CLAIRE
Alex and I had the most incredible
fight last night. I locked him out of
his own apartment. He was screaming
my name on the street. The cops came.
Such a mess.

ROSE
(impressed)
He was screaming for you on the
street? Wow! I've never seen a man
actually do that. Except once, but he
was also urinating. What was the
fight about?

CLAIRE
He's driving me nuts Rose. No matter
what I do, no matter where I go -
THERE HE IS! He calls me all day from
work asking me what am I doing. I was
sleeping the other night and I wake
up and he's staring at me!

ROSE
That's kind of sweet.

CLAIRE
Please - it's like sleeping with a
flashlight on you. I was in the
middle of one of my lesbian fantasy
dreams and he's staring at me like
I'm supposed to include him!

(more)

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

CLAIRE (cont'd)
I swear ~ if he wasn't gorgeous, rich
and straight, I wouldn't even bother.
What should I do?

ROSE
You're asking me?

CLAIRE
Yes. You've known him longer. Could
you maybe talk to him ~ tell him to
back off a little? He'd listen to you.

ROSE
Back off? You're living together!

CLAIRE
I know. I would just like to have a
few hours a day where I completely”
forget that.

ROSE
(irritated)
Then move out Claire! What do you
want me to say? Jesus!

CLAIRE
What are you getting angry about?

Claire looks over Rose's shoulder, unhappy by what she sees.

CLAIRE (Cont'd)
Oh, I don't believe this.

Rose turns to see ALEX approaching. Alex is an extremely
handsome man, late thirties-early forties, with blue eyes,

jet black

hair and athlete's body. Rose is clearly flustered

by his presence - like a woman who is afraid her true
feelings might show. Alex arrives at the table and kisses
Rose's cheek.

ALEX
Hi Rose.

CLAIRE
What did you do, follow me?

CONTINUED
CONTINUED: (2)

ALEX
I called your mother. She told me
where Rose was. I think it's
important we talk.

CLATRE
I think it's important I go to the
ladies room. ALONE! Excuse me.

Claire leaves in a huff. Alex pulls up a chair and sits down
beside Rose.

ALEX
This must seem all pretty childish to
you.

ROSE

That's not for me to say.

ALEX
It does to me. What am I doing, Rose?

ROSE
Why is everybody asking me!? I feel
like the Aunt in Gigi.

ALEX
I'm sorry. It's me. I don't know
what's wrong with me. If she doesn't
wake up every morning telling me how
estatic she is, I worry. I've never
behaved like this over a woman before.

This info doesn't exactly thrill Rose. But she attempts to
help, recognizing how upset he is.

ROSE
Maybe you just need to relax your
grip a little, buddy. Take things for
granted a little bit more. I mean,
you're living together - what more
proof do you need?

ALEX
I'm not happy Rose. I live everyday
worried she's going to take off.
Maybe this isn't love. Maybe it's
just obsession. Whatever it is, I
hate it.

CONTINUED
10.

CONTINUED: (3)
Rose is both surprised and thrilled to hear this.

. ALEX (Cont'd)
I was thinking - maybe I should ask
her to move out for while. At least
I won't worry about her abandoning me
anymore, then she can feel what it's
like to be without me. What do you
think?

Rose nods, speechless. Alex takes her hand and stares at her
lovingly. Rose's heart races as SHE FANTASIZES Alex saying:

FANTASY —

ALEX (Cont'd)
She isn't you, Goddess of my heart.
Have I been so blind?

He reaches for her and KISSES HER PASSIONATELY.
REALITY ~

ALEX (Cont'd)
Thank for listening, Rose.

He squeezes her hand affectionately as Claire returns. Rose
feels self-conscious ~- as if her fantasy were seen by others.

cuUT TO:
EXT. ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY - NIGHT.

Camera on a poster in the window which reads; PROF. GREGORY
LARKIN, PROFESSOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES - COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY. AUTHOR OF THE NEW BEST SELLER; " ABSOLUTE TRUTH;
A STUDY OF THE MATHEMATICAL EQUATION CALLED CREATION". BOOK
SIGNING AT ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY; 550 COLUMBUS AVE. 8 PM.

INT. ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY - NIGHT.

A gathering of New York's intelligentsia wine and brie crowd
are seated in a room facing Gregory at a podium, surrounded
by copies of his book. He is uneasy about speaking in front
of a crowd;

GREGORY
Thank you all very much. I am honored
by this warm and gracious welcome.

CONTINUED
ii.

CONTINUED:

GREGORY (cont'd)
..My, uh, fiance Katherine, told me
that, um... "Absolute Truth" might be
too strong for the title of a
theoretical science book.

Some audience giggles, including KATHERINE who sits in the
front row. She is the woman we saw earlier in Gregory's bed:
a beautiful, sweet-natured, blonde.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
My answer to her was ~ who ... who
said this was a theoretical book ...

Laughter. Gregory is pleased his attempt at humor paid off.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
As I stand here at the end of a
journey, I am reminded of something
Descartes once said -

Gregory, as he loses himself in these words, which obviously
mean a great deal to him;

GREGORY (Cont'd)
«.-"For whether I am awake or
asleep - two and three always make
five and the square can never have
more than four sides and it does not
seem possible that truths so clear
and apparent can be suspected of any
uncertainty" ... Numbers and the
principles they represent are
unchanging and everlasting and
underlie everything we are and
everything we do. They are a
dependable constant in a
frighteningly undependable world. And
they have consumed my life the way I
suppdése an artist might be consumed
by color or a musician by harmonics.

Gregory stops when he sees a most unnerving sight -

JESSIE ARTHUR, essayist/poet, is entering from the back of
the room and takes a seat on the aisle. Just as in the
advertisement, she is a knock-out. She looks up to Gregory
and smiles. Gregory almost loses his train of thought
completely. He can't take his eyes off her.

CONTINUED
12.

CONTINUED: (2)

He accidently knocks over a water glass as he repeats himself
to find his place.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Uh ... musician by harmonics ... This
book took over ... over five years
and it is not without a little
sadness that I say good-bye to it
consuming my days and nights. Thank
you.

Applause. Angle on Gregory's friend, HENRY FINE - a robust
Henry Miller-like middle aged professor with the libido of a
teenage rock star. Noticing Gregory staring at the back,
Henry turns to see Jesse, as does Katherine.

HENRY
Oh-oh.

curt TO:
INT. BACK OFFICE OF ENDICOTT GALLERY - NIGHT.

Gregory paces as Henry enters. Gregory perks up.

GREGORY
Is she gone?

HENRY
No. She's waiting to say hello.

GREGORY
Oh God - what am I going to do?

HENRY
Will you relax! There's almost a
hundred people out there. What could
happen?

GREGORY
You don't know her. I'll say hello.
She'll say hello and the next thing
you know I'll be trapped, naked ina
hotel room with her.

HENRY

Well then I suggest you stay in here
and I'll go out and say hello to her!

CONTINUED
a3.

CONTINUED:

GREGORY
I have to go to the bathroom.

He exits into a john. Henry talks through the door.

HENRY
I thought she was living in Paris?
Why do you think she's here?

GREGORY (0.S.)
To destroy me. Why else? She must
have heard I was almost happy.

HENRY
Did you read her last collection? I
love a woman with a dirty mind. Makes
me hopeful I can marry one day.

We hear a flush, some water running as Gregory talks.

GREGORY (0.S.)

You have to help me. Don't leave me
alone with her. And don't let her
come to dinner with us.

HENRY
You know Katherine will invite her.
She'd invite Mrs. Oswald to John
John's wedding.

Gregory exits having splashed water on his face, leaving the
sides of his hair still wet with strands sticking out askew.
He looks a bit deranged.

GREGORY
We better get out there before they
meet. How do I look?

Henry looks him up and down. He notices that Gregory forgot
to zip his fly - his white briefs showing through - but
decides not to teil him.

HENRY
Great.

INT. ENDICOTT GALLERY ~ LATER.
Gregory and Henry enter with the reception in full swing.

There is no specific dialogue - just general conversation
throughout the room.

COMTINUED
14.

CONTINUED:

Gregory is uncomfortable being the center of so much
attention. He smiles graciously. People smile back, wondering
why his hair is wet and his fly is open. They look over the
crowd-to see Jessica and Katherine talking. Katherine spots
them, and waves them over with a bright, smiling face. Henry
remarks about Katherine's sunny, innocent personality.

HENRY
Poor kid - she's looks like a baby
seal about to be ciubbed.

They move through the crowd to the two women. Gregory's
breathing gets short. Henry is enjoying this immensely.
Innecent Katherine acts every bit the hostess.

KATHERINE
I didn't know you knew Jessica
Arthur. I use your products all the
time.

JESSICA
They're not my products. I just did
an endorsement for them a while back.
(to Gregory)
Hello Greg. You're looking well ...

Jessie eyes his fly and smiles. Gregory looks down,
mortified, and turns to zip up as Henry introduces himself.

HENRY
Hello. I'm Henry Fine.

Jessie just smiles, not saying hello in return.

HENRY (Cont'd)
I've heard so much about you. And
I've just finished your latest
collection. Terrific stuff! I
especially like the one about the two
housewives who make love over a
dishwasher. Quite a fantasy.

JESSICA
(not liking him)
It was a metaphor.

HENRY
Pity.

CONTINUED
15.

CONTINUED: (2)

KATHERINE
We're having a little party over at
Cafe Luxemburg for Greg. Come!

Gregory stops breathing. Henry can't wait for an answer.
Jessie pauses to heighten the suspense.

JESSICA
No. I have an early plane to catch.

Gregory and Henry are both relieved and disappointed.

JESSICA (Cont'd)

Thanks anyway. I just heard through
the grapevine you were speaking
tonight, so I thought I'd just pop in
and say congratulations.

THEY SHAKE HANDS. Just touching her, makes him shudder.

JESSICA (Cont'd)
Congratulations.

GREGORY
Thank you.

JESSICA
Nice meeting you both. Bye.

She walks away. Katherine gives Gregory a peck on the cheek
then turns to talk to a nearby friend. Henry whispers.

HENRY
Well - you're in the clear.

But Gregory’s expression is still disturbed. He opens his
palm to Henry to reveal A SMALL CARD which Jessica slipped in
as they shook hands. Henry reads: HOTEL MARK ROOM 2718.

HENRY (Cont'd)
Man - she's good.

INT. RABBIT IN THE HAT ~ NIGHT.

Rose and BARRY NEUFELD - a nerdy, bifocaled Wally Cox biology
professor ~ are having dinner. Suddenly, Barry looks at Rose
in surprise.

CONTINUED
16.

CONTINUED:

BARRY
Ooo, what's that?

ROSE
What?

He reaches over and pulls an EGG from her ear. Dreading this,
Rose forces herself to be impressed.

ROSE (Cont'd)
Oh. Wow. I didn't know you were into
magic.

BARRY
There are a lot of things you don't
know about me.

ROSE
I bet.

BARRY
I'm glad we finally did this. I've
cancelled so many reservations for
us, I'm going to be blacklisted at
every restaurant in town.

ROSE
(sincerely)
I'm really sorry about that Barry.

BARRY
It's all right. You're here now.

Rose is getting annoyed as Barry reaches over and pulls a
COIN out of her other ear.

ROSE
Incredible. .

Rose stares at him and fantasizes:

FANTASY:

Barry raises his hands and snaps his fingers - and turns into
ALEX.

BARRY (0.S.)
Rose?

REALITY:

CONTINUED
17.

CONTINUED: (2)
Barry looks curiously at Rose, who seems pre-occupied.

. BARRY (Cont'd)
Rose? Anything wrong?

ROSE
Oh. No. Oh, there's the waiter! Can
you pull the check out of his ear
Barry - I really have to go home.

Barry looks disappointed.

cuT TO:
INT. JESSICA'S HOTEL ROOM ~ NIGHT.

There is a knock on the door. Jessica, wearing a see through
Victoria Secret outfit, opens the door to find Gregory
standing helpless before her. She smiles.

GREGORY
Please don't do this to me.

Jessica quides him, helplessly, into the room.
cur TO:
INT. ROSE AND HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

Rose enters a long foyer of sprawling eight room apartment in
a traditional West End Avenue brownstone. She walks down the

hallways to the bedrooms, moving towards her mother Hannah's

room. The door is open. The light is on. Rose steps into the

doorway and stops.

HANNAH MORGAN, is a beautiful Elizabeth Taylor sixty year old
who is still turning heads. She wears an elegant pajama
outfit, sitting upright in bed with pastel pillows and
femininity oozing out of the wallpaper. She pauses in her
reading to look up at her daughter and ask about her date:

HANNAH
So?

ROSE
So?

Pause. They've been through this before. Hannah shrugs and
goes back to her reading. Rose exits.
18.

INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
Rose sits at her vanity gazing at her image:
FANTASY: -

ALEX (0.S.)
ROOOOSSSE!

Rose rushes to the window. Looking out, she sees ALEX,
dressed like Stanley Kowalski, screaming her name on the
street.

ALEX (Cont'd)
ROSE! OPEN THY HEART TO ME THAT I
MIGHT PLOW THY FIELDS TIL THE SUN IS
NO MORE.

ROSE
COME, MAN OF MY HEART!

SUDDENLY, the door to her bedroom flies open and Alex enters.
They rush into each other's arms and begin making passionate
love on her bed. ROSE'S FANTASY DISSOLVES INTO GREGORY'S
REALITY AS WE -

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL ROOM ~ NIGHT.

Gregory and Jessica ravage each other; tearing clothes,
devouring kisses, cries of pleasure. All the while, Gregory
releases something in him that is completely antithetical to
his college professor persona. We see an abandon and
fearlessness that comically borders on madness.

TIME LAPSE:
LATER; SAME LOCATION.

The room looks like a bomb dropped. Clothes, furniture, bed
sheets, food - all tossed and strewn about. Camera finds
Jessie sitting naked, wearing nothing but Gregory's tie,
voraciously eating room service. Gregory sits against the
headboard, staring at her in adoration, hanging on every word.

JESSIE
It was in Ravello and I happened to
follow this nice looking middle aged
woman into a church. I saw her take
out this crumpled piece of paper,
kiss it, leave it in the pew and walk
out. So of course I had to look ...

COWTIMUED
CONTINUED:

19.

JESSIE (cont'd)
and what it was, was a novena - with
instructions, in Italian, "leave this
in the church on the ninth day of the
month". And the prayer was, “Dear God
++. Please bring him back to me"
written three times in a row. Now,
you know me, I had find this woman so
I caught up with her in the market
place and I told her I was a writer
for some Christian paper in America
and would she talk to me. I bought
her some coffee and she told me she
was asking God to bring back her dead
husband. I said’, but do you actually
believe that your husband can rise
from the dead? She said, no, no, no
++. She knew her husband would always
be dead but there was another man,
alive, who was interested in her and
she was beginning to lose the feeling
of her husband ... in her heart ...
and she was asking God to bring him
back in there ... because she had
loved him so much ... she didn't want
to forget, no matter what happened
with this new man. And I thought - my
God ... to love someone so much, you
still want the feeling
of loving them even though you know
you can never be with them again

Gregory is COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY HER.

JESSIE (Cont'd)
So I've started another book. And
it's about this woman. She went to
God, she told me, because when she
fell in love with her husband, she
became very religious, because she
was so grateful for such a feeling.
It was the first time she knew she
had a soul. It made me think about
us. You know, no matter how many
others I get involved with - the only
thing that makes sense to me is the
craziness we have when we're
together.

CONTINUED: (2)

JESSIE (cont'd)
When I think about it, this is the
longest relationship I've ever had.
(She devours him with
a kiss)
I sometimes think we're only ever one
whole person when we're together.

She devours him with a kiss. He melts. She returns to her
food. Gregory stares at her until he gets the nerve to ask -

GREGORY
It's a man, isn't it?
JESSICA
What is?
GREGORY
The reason you're here - in New York.
JESSICA
(hesitates, then:)
It's over ...
GREGORY

Are you staying in town?

JESSICA
Depends. French Fry?
(He shakes no)
Are you and Katherine getting married?

GREGORY
Well, we reached that point where
we've been together too long. We
either had to get married or stop
seeing each other.

JESSIE
So which is it going to be?

GREGORY
(helpless)
Why do you do this to me?
Jessica hesitates - knowing this moment would come.

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

22.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
You don't know what I'm like after
you leave. I nearly lost my mind last
time. I couldn't think straight, I
couldn't work, I had no control and
I didn't care. I remember teaching a
calculus class when I suddenly
thought of making love to you and I
had to run into the teacher's lounge
to masturbate.

JESSIE
(impressed)
Really?

GREGORY

You appear then disappear and in
between I fool myself with other
women. If you're going to destroy me,
then do it! Tell me I mean nothing to
you. Tell me you make love like that
with other men. Tell me you feel
nothing for me!

But Jessie shakes her head. She cannot tell him that. Gregory

grabs her

He kisses

into an embrace.

GREGORY (Cont'd)

Then marry me. Don't you see? Loving
you is my dream, my nightmare, ny
faith ... my madness ... Don't leave
me in the real world with the Godless
and the sane.

JESSIE
(really impressed)
Shit!
her until she pulls away.

JESSICA
Let me ask you something Greg. You
think you'd still feel the same way
after being married a few years? Do
you think you'd still lose your mind?
I don't want to be some miserable
wife who only remembers a man loving
her this much.

GREGORY
Forget marriage. Just stay with me.

JESSICA
Then I'll make you miserable. That's
how I think real love works <
there's only ever one winner. Let's
keep it the way it is Greg. Let's
keep dying for each other. No matter
who I'm with, youfre still the only
man I'lk ever really love. Isn't that
enough?

GREGORY
I can't let you go.

JESSIE
Then stay with me. In this room. We
won't leave. I have it for two more
days. Let's ruin each other.

GREGORY
And after that?

JESSIE
We'll see.

They begin to make love again.

The students wait. Henry enters.
HENRY
I'm afraid Prof. Larkin isn't feeling

INT. ROSE AND HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT.
Rose creates a beautifully designed platter of food for her
and her mother. She moves to the dining room where she has

set a beautiful table, with china and crystal.

She takes the napkins and FOLDS THEM INTO FANCY THREE
CORNERED HATS - taking care as if she were expecting company,
instead of just her mother.

INT. DINING ROOM ~ NIGHT.

Camera pans dining table ~ first, Rose wearing a worn out
sweat suit. Her plate is full but she has yet to take a bite.
She has a RITUAL of preparing her food that is deliberate and
intricate - mixing her mustards and steak sauces into one
round form on her plate; mixing and cutting her salad;
utilizing her fork and knife in such as way as to get little
bits of meat, vegetable and starch onto one forkful...all
with intense concentration and purpose.

Camera then arrives on her mother, HANNAH staring at her
performing this ritual. She is fully made-up wearing a
sweater outfit, complete with jewelry.

HANNAH
T'm halfway through my meal and you
haven't even started yet.

Rose holds up her forkful of each food group and calls it:

ROSE
The perfect bite.

HANNAH
You need to see someone.

Rose turns on the TV 0.S. to A BALLGAME. Hannah eats with
even more irritation.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
--.I can't tell you how sorry I am
your father put a television in this
room. I hate this television and I
hate it in the dining room. Can't we
have a conversation?

ROSE
Mom, I had three classes today. This
is my only relax-

HANNAH
Fine, fine, never mind. I can't win.

Feeling badly, Rose TURNS the TV OFF w/ the remote.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
No!...I said never mind.

Hannah picks up the remote and TURNS it back ON.

ROSE
No ... I'm sorry.

Rose laughs at the silliness of this scene.

ROSE

She TURNS it OFF. Hannah reaches for the remote, but Rose
pulls it away.

There's nothing different about it.
I'm the same old bag I was this
morning.

HANNAH (Cont'd)

I feel sorry for him. I think he

THIS is what you want to taik about?
How can you say things like that? ~

HANNAH
Because I know my daughter. She's
incapable of loving someone elise.
She's going to break his heart, you

Deep down, Rose can't help but think Hannah is right.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
But I guess that's justice in a way.

down. Never wanted children. Lived
her own life, from man to man. She

HANNAH

later to celebrate.

Rose stops in mid-bite. Her heart sinks. Hannah knows full
well what Rose is feeling.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
Now, you're not going to fall apart
are you?

Rose glares at her, swallowing her true feelings.

reason sex isn't that important to

GREGORY
I'm so sorry, Katherine.
KATHERINE

No. Don't be. I'm relieved in a way.
I thought there was something wrong
with me. Well ... goodbye Greg.

We were separated at birth.
ROSE

Two more drinks when you have a

chance.

The waiter nods and exits. Doris begins to eat. Rose
"prepares" her plate - methodically fixing dollops of mayo
and dressing on her plate.

DORIS :
You feeling any better sweetie?
ROSE
Oh, I'll be fine.

I gotta be honest with you though.
I'm not looking forward to being maid

I was maid of honor nine times. I
think when I hit ten, I should get a
free husband and dishes.

You know, it might not even happen.
Claire's such a nut.

ROSE
Doesn't matter. He asked. He wants

life or else what's the point? I'll
never be a beauty. I'll never have
some gorgeous guy in love with ne,
screaming my name in the streets.
I'll never have one of those crazy,
passionate, all- consuming, fucking
for hours in some sweaty motel room
by the side of a highway love affairs.

DORIS

ROSE
What's depressing, is to realize I'm
as bad as everyone else. I mean,
what's wrong with Barry Neufeld?

DORIS
He irritates the shit out of you and
he looks like Mr. Peabody.

ROSE
Why should that matter - I'm no great
prize.

DORIS

All right - so in addition to
everything else, you're as shallow as
the rest of us. Give yourself a break.

ROSE
I mean what the hell is love anyway?

DORIS
You're just lonely honey. You're
human. It'll pass.

ROSE
fhe thing is - I want so little. I'm
not asking for diamond rings and a
house full of kids ... I just want
someone - who knows me. They way
people in love know each other -
isn't that stupid? Their favorite
toothpaste, their nightmares, their
secrets. That's what cures
loneliness. When somebody else is out
there who knows who you are ~ and
whose thinking about you. And who
wants you.

DORIS
And you think that's easier to get
than diamond rings? Honey, you need
a change. Why don't you move out -
get your own place?

ROSE
No. Living alone sounds very Holly
Golightly in theory but the truth is
you come home to an empty apartment
every night. I'm not pretty enough to
live alone. I'd turn into a cat lady
who flirts with delivery boys.

DORIS
Well, if it's any consolation, I bet
even beautiful people get lonely.
Look at that woman over there.

After another knock or two, the door is unlocked by a

reveal -

Gregory sitting in a chair with a blanket wrapped around him
staring into space. It looks as if he's been crying. He is an
unshaven wreck. The room has been cleared of Jessie's things.

HENRY
Yep.

Gregory, disheveled, wearing the same clothes he's had for

dangerous, self-pitying demeanor.

HENRY
I have a couple of things to do, then
I have to sit in on a class for a
teacher evaluation and then I'm free.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
We'll go home, change your clothes
and get something to eat. All right?

GREGORY
My life is almost half over and I'm
still juggling feathers, Henry.

HENRY
What does that mean?

GREGORY
It's any expression of my mothers’.
Right before her fourth marriage she
said to me “Don't ever waste your
time holding on to love - you might
as well try juggling feathers".

A STUDENT, HAL, catches up with them, holding a report.
HAL
Hi. Mr. Larkin. Hal Benning.
"Economics in Transition". I really
have to talk to you about this B-
minus you gave me on my Max Weber
paper. I have real problem with it.

Gregory stares at him with a mad gleam in his eye and rips
the paper out of his hands.

GREGORY
Here! You want an A? An A plus!

HAL
Uh ... Sure.

Greg writes A-plus and shoves it back to Hal.

INT. ROSE'S CLASSROOM - DAY.

33.

Gregory and Henry sit in the back of the classroom while Rose
gives an impassioned lecture to her spellbound students.

ROSE
«+. I believe it's our addictions to
illusions like perfect sex and true

love that are actually keeping people

today separate and alone. "Falling
in love" is a man-made conceit.
Before the Industrial Revolution -

before men left the home for business

and women became the leisure class -
before sex and beauty were used as
marketing tools for the propagation
of the species -

She refers to daguerreotypes and tintypes depicting images of

women as objects of beauty.

ROSE (Cont'd)
What drew men and women together? I

can tell you one thing - it must have

been a lot more real than what's
drawing them today. A fifty percent
aivorce rate among married couples -
more single parents than you can
count. Which is fine - but why?
Because people want children and not
relationships. Relationships are too
hard. Why? Because we are asked to
meet ridiculous, romantic standards!

Gregory is mesmerized.

ROSE (Cont'd)
Do you know how many lonely people
there are waiting for this perfect,
romantic love - this illusion when
actually their perfect mate might be
right in front of them only they
can't recognize it.

COMTINUED
CONTINUED:

34.

ROSE (cont'd)
And sex, well, how often have you
heard “Oh he isn't my type", "Oh
she's doesn't turn me on" and people
stay alone. This obsession with
beauty and lust while everything
around us is decaying ... Everyone's
lover has to be attractive and
successful and funny and charming and
the truth is, there simply aren't
enough funny, successful, attractive,
charming people to go around. We're
human ~ we spit and sweat and gain
weight and age and why isn't that all
right?! Because of the malicious
fantasies created by fashion
designers and commercials about
deodorant sharing that tell us it's
not. "Don't settle for second best"
"Be the best , smell the best, get
the beautiful guy, lose the weight
and marry an Adonis" - "perfect love
does exit ~ right, here in this
bottle for only 29.99." And whether
we're conscious of it or not, we fall
for it. The idea of having to "fall
in love" has become the most
contagious and deadly virus of
twentieth century ~ killing
relationships before they can even
begin... Leaving men and women who
have so much to offer - excluded. As
if relationships were only meant for
the select, the beautiful and the few
instead of being everyone's
birthright.

Rose is panting. She has given this speech without a breath.

The class,

and Gregory, sit stunned. Waiting. Rose feels

exposed for a moment, and tries to sum up.

ROSE (Cont'd)
(genuine belief)

We live in such a transitory world.
People marry for love, which
fades...or beauty or passion...which
fade. You ever notice how most
friendships last longer than most
marriages.?

Is it even possible anymore for a man
and a woman to truly see each other

Questions, comments.

The class breaks out into applause. Rose smiles, feeling
great love for these kids. Gregory looks as if he's been
transformed by a revelation.

EXT. CAMPUS ~- DAY.
Henry walks with an excited Gregory.

GREGORY
She's amazing!

HENRY
Well, she talks a good line.

GREGORY
What do you mean? I thought she made
a lot of sense.

HENRY
Well, considering how she looks, I
guess yeah ~ she's got a point.

Gregory stops. Henry stops, surprised.

GREGORY
I didn't notice how she looked.

HENRY
That's my point.

GREGORY
I've had beautiful women Henry. I've
had great sex. And I'm alone ... I
want to meet her.

Look - you're coming off of Jessie
again. You're not thinking straight.

HENRY (cont'd)
Beside, in my opinion, sex is the
only. reason people get together
because it's the only divine act
humans can accomplish. It fulfills
everyone's inherent desire to return
to God. It is my belief that coming
will replace praying in the 2ist
century. I'm thinking of writing a
theological treatise on it and
calling, it "Theoboffism".

GREGORY

All I know is, I'm lonely. Maybe
Jessie is my one real love - so what?
Maybe my mother was right or maybe
we're only allowed one a lifetime and
I got stuck with someone I can't
have. But maybe there's something
else I can have. Something I can
trust, feel safe with, build with ...

HENRY
With her!?

GREGORY
Well ... I don't know. Maybe. Why
not? She's seems like a fascinating
woman.

HENRY
Fine. But no matter what you want in
a woman, you can't deny the fact
that there has to be a physical
attraction too.

GREGORY
I'm not so sure.

Gregory enters - well dressed and shaven. Rose is sitting at
a desk piled high with opened books and papers. The walls are

Can I help you?

GREGORY
Uh ... I'm Gregory Larkin - Math
Department. I sat in on your class
yesterday with Henry Fine.

Oh yeah. Did he pass me?

GREGORY
I'm sure he did. I thought your
lecture was ... fascinating. I was
wondering if you were free - if you
wanted to go for a cup of coffee or
something.

Rose immediately recognizes this is a good looking guy asking
her for coffee, and her “Alex alarms" go up.

ROSE
Uh, well, no, sorry. I'm actually
scheduled for something now ... soon,

GREGORY
Oh, well maybe some other time.
(Rose nods)
I think you're a gifted teacher. You
really had those students. I'd love
to discuss your teaching methods with
you some time as well.

ROSE
Thank you.

Gregory exits. Rose immediately rises and crosses calmly over
to her water cooler. She gets some cold water in a small
paper cup and quite matter-of-factly, THROWS THE WATER IN HER
OWN FACE.

ROSE (Cont'd)
That was close.

INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM ~ NIGHT.

Rose opens the bottom drawer of her vanity and reveals HER
ASSORTMENT OF CUPCAKES AND SWEETS. She extracts a package of
cupcakes, then. moves to a CD PLAYER raises the volume. We
hear THE BAND'S "IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE". She raises an
already lit JOINT to her mouth and inhales. As she sings
along, getting stoned, we get a glimpse into a younger

Rose - a sixties hopeful with a great joy and thirst for
life, before any expectations vanished. She then inhales a
bit too much, and must use every effort not to cough out
loud - banging her hands against the furniture, her eyes
tearing. She makes sure to exhale out an opened window. She
takes a deep breath, then douses out the joint on the sill.
She takes her cupcake to her bed and makes a tray out of an
art book. Laying down, she serves herself the cupcake,
listening to the music and watching the ballgame on a TV with
no sound opposite the bed. She comments to herself -

ROSE
Life is good!

She takes a bite of her cupcake and watches the game and
listens to The Band. All of a sudden she freezes ~- as if a
thought had crossed her mind and got stuck there. We can tell
by her expression, that she isn't really watching the game or
listening to the music or even consciously chewing. She's
thinking about Gregory. But then she decides.

ROSE (Cont'd)

No. I was right to say no. That was
a good move. Have lunch with a guy
like that, next thing you know I'm
cooking for him and holding his hand
when he has problems and fantasizing
about raping him in a restaurant.
Never again. The end. End of story!

THE PHONE RINGS. Stoned, she stares at it for a moment or
two, fascinated by the ringing. Until - -

Rose and Doris listen to Gregory explain his book as they
wait for their lunch.

GREGORY

««.80 what I had hoped to accomplish
with the book was to show within this
Universal Order, numbers are not just
numbers but symbols that represent -
how should I say it - metaphysical
concepts. First there's the One, the
Universal, the All - that from which
everything springs and is ever
contained in - you still with me?

Then we divided with One into the
Two - the duality of the One and
One's awareness of itself through
it's opposite, the Two. Then there's
three, which is the relationship
between the two and the one ...

ROSE
So four would be the result of the
relationship - the product produced
by the sun.

GREGORY
That's right? Did you read the book?

ROSE
No. I almost bought it though. I held
it in my hands in the bookstore for
a good ten minutes.

GREGORY.

That's all right, I'll send you a
copy ... but getting back to the
three for a minute, what you might
find interesting for what you teach
is the importance of the
relationship. See, without the three,
relationship - a number, or a person,
is just ...

ROSE
Spinning it's own gears.

GREGORY
Exactly. This is marvelous.

You're an idiot. He's likes you.

ROSE
What are we in fifth grade? He likes
me! He likes my brain.

DORIS
So? Take it slow. One organ at a time.

Gregory returns just as A WAITER appears with two salads and
a PEPPER MILL. He is about to pepper Rose's salad:

ROSE
No pepper for me. But could you get
me a little side dish of extra
dressing.

DORTS
Me too.

She begins her ritual of carefully cutting and mixing her
salad - picking out the wilted or bad looking leaves as she
speaks. Gregory is fascinated by her ritual.

GREGORY
You're class is remarkable. Maybe you
can sit in on my class on next week.

Rose awakens with a start! She gets her bearings and realizes
the class is over - and she was asleep.

I think they're hot.

No one pays attention to her and she notices it as Henry
speaks directly to Rose -

HENRY
I didn't mean to offend you or-

ROSE
I'm not offended. I just think times
are changing. In some tribes - like
the Wodaabes, it's the men who spend
hours in make-up sessions and are
judged in beauty contests by the
women. And they're a much older
society than ours - maybe we're just
catching up. Men as objects of female
lust is quite natural and if women
are going to make themselves sick and
surgically alter themselves to stay
in the running, you men are going to
have skip the extra beer and tighten
your butts too.

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT.

Candy is in front of mirror fixing her make-up. Rose enters
to wash her hands.

CANDY
You're a professor?
ROSE
Yes.
CANDY

How long have you been with Gregory?
I think he's gorgeous.

ROSE
We're not together. We're just
associates. How long have you been
seeing Henry?

CANDY
Not long. I'm really just in it for
the sex.

ROSE
Really?

CANDY

It's such a turn on fucking a smart
guy. I feel kind of like a genius
everytime he comes.

Rose laughs. Candy smiles, warming up to her.

Gregory is disturbed by Henry's remark.
INT. LADIES ROOM -

CANDY
It's not going to last. Not that I
want it to. We're just having some
fun. Eventually there'll be someone
prettier, someone younger he'll get
a thing for and that'll be it.

ROSE
Doesn't that bother you?

CANDY
No. I plan to be married within five
years then I'll never have to worry
about it again. I don't kid myself.
I know the things I can offer a man,
a lot of other women can too. It's
all timing, ya know. You just have to
hit that one guy whose ready to stop
sampling everything he sees. And then
you can stop too. It's different for
women like you I think.

ROSE
Why?

CANDY
If a guy falls for you, you know it's
for something that'll last. You don't
have to worry about losing it as you
get older. You'll probably get even
smarter when you age.

ROSE
Can I ask you a question? If you
could switch places with me, would
you?

Candy stops applying lipstick. She feels uncomfortable by the
question. Her answer is obviously no.

ROSE (Cont'd)
See, that's the difference.

INT. RESTAURANT ~ NIGHT.

At the table, the WAITER has brought their meals. Candy has
ordered a large grilled vegetable salad. Rose ordered lamb
chops and potatoes with special orders of mustard, extra mint
jelly and sour cream on the side. She begins to prepare the
mint jelly and mustard with small dollops along with dicing
her potato along with the sour cream. Everyone else has
already started eating , as they watch Rose's ritual. When
she finally takes a bite. Gregory smiles. She smiles through
her food.

ROSE
The perfect bite.

He leans over to her.
GREGORY
Listen. I have two tickets to the
Philharmonic. It's a benefit. Black

Rose, her mouth full of food, is impressed by Gregory's

ROSE
Around the 12th Century they had a
thing called Courtly Love - and it
was a love usually between a knight
and a lady he idolized,
worshipped...But the rules were they
could never have sex, never be
married and yet they must always keep
their passion for each other
alive...It was as if they took this
baser human love and through their
restrictions squeezed everything out
it that was thought to be impure or
temporary. It was thought to be one
of the highest expressions of love.
As opposed to the more human,
everyday, going-to-the-bathroom-in-
front-of-each-other kind of love.

Gregory is inspired.

INT. BERGDORF'S ~- DAY.

Rose is cautiously looking through some evening wear. All she

finds are
finds one

skimpy cocktail dresses and low-cut gowns. She
black sequined high neck number, but it has no

back. A SALESLADY approaches.

SALESWOMAN
Would you like to try that on?

ROSE
Oh no. I'd look like a neon sign. I
have this formal tonight and of
course I waited until the last
minute ...

- SALESWOMAN
Well what are you looking for?

ROSE
Something comfortable, big, loose,
dark ~ actually, I should be in the
linen department buying a comforter.

Rose walks through, carrying a dress box. She passes by women
getting make-overs. She's dying to try.

INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM ~ EARLY EVENING.

Rose sits at her vanity with her back to us. She is wearing
a simple, black evening dress - loose, formless. WE DO NOT
SEE HER FACE.

HANNAH (0.S.)
Rose?

Without moving her head or neck, Rose responds. Hannah enters
and stands in the doorway; cool, detached;

HANNAH (Cont'd)
When did you get home? I didn't hear
you come in?

Rose remains stiff, with her back to us.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
What's wrong with you?

Hannah approaches and is surprised when she sees Rose - with
a complete make-up job. The make-up is overdone and not very
complimentary to her natural looks. Rose talks with tight
lips.

ROSE
What do you think?

HANNAH
Why are you talking like that?

ROSE
I'm wearing so much, I'm afraid it'll
break. How do I look?

HANNAH
Paralyzed. Why are you wearing so
much?

ROSE

Well according to this cosmetics
expert I have a myriad of problems -
my eyes are set too close together,
my nose is crooked, my chin is chubby
and my skin is confused. Should I
take it off?

HANNAH
Well, if you're going to wear make-
up, you should do something with your
hair.

ROSE
What?

Hannah picks up a brush and and pins and spray, and begins to
style.

HANNAH
He must be very handsome this one,
for you to go through all this.

ROSE
I'm not doing it for him. It's a
formal.

HANNAH

No one says you have to wear make-up
to a formal. You've been seeing him
for a few weeks. Do you think
something might happen with this one?

ROSE
Stop calling him "this one". Sounds
like you're picking out a lobster.
We're just friends. I haven't been
"seeing him". DON'T TOUCH MY FACE!
I'm just helping him with his
teaching. It's not a date or anything.

HANNAH
Then what does it matter how you look?

ROSE
(hopefully)
I just wanted to...

I guess it doesn't matter.

Oh, young women today. You take

nothing to do with it. You think men
know what they want before they want
it? Half the time, they'd sleep with
cows if that's all they could meet.
How do you think syphilis was created?

ROSE
How did we get from my date to the
origin of syphilis?

HANNAH
I thought it wasn't a date.

Touche. Hannah begins to spray the teased hair. Rose asks
vulnerably.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
If he takes you to dinner, order some
simple - a nice fish. Broiled. And no
dessert. A cup of coffee is more than
sufficient.

ROSE
Mom ... when I was born, did you
think I was pretty?

HANNAH
fch. You were my child. My firstborn.

ROSE
But you must have thought something
about how I looked. Did you think I
was a pretty baby?

HANNAH
Silly. What's pretty anyway? You're
sister's pretty - you think she'll be
happy. I give that marriage two
months.

INT. CAB ~ NIGHT; A FEW MINUTES LATER.
In the backseat, Kose is thrown back and ferth.

ROSE
There's no rush.

But the driver doesn't hear. Both the windows on both the
rear doors are down, causing a tremendous wind tunnel that is
tearing apart her hairdo. She tries to shut them, but can't.

ROSE (Cont'd)
What's wrong with the windows?

CAB DRIVER
, Broke...Both broke.
(he giggles in Arabic)

Rose braces herself, while trying to hold down her hair. The
cab stops at a red light. Rose catches her breath. She
glances over at a parallel cab that also has a single woman
in the backseat. The woman is dressed up and having an
equally horrific cab ride. Her face is smeared with lipstick
that she has been trying to apply. She glances over to Rose,
Rose smiles. The woman smiles, then both cabs peel off as if
in a drag race.

cuT TO:
EXT. LINCOLN CENTER ~ NIGHT.
Rose exits the cab - her hair has been wind blown into a
complete mess. She approaches Gregory who is genuinely glad
to see her. He smiles broadly. Rose is painfully self-
conscious.

ROSE

Gregory is unphased by her appearance.

GREGORY
Sorry for what? You're exactly on

ROSE

Yes...I..no, I mean... my hair..I

But Gregory neither compliments nor consoles her about her
looks. Rose suddenly feels very silly.

GREGORY

INT. AVERY FISHER HALL - NIGHT.
On stage, the Philharmonic Orchestra plays Cesar Franck's
PSYCHE. In the audience, Rose sits beside Gregory listening.
Gregory reaches into his pocket and pulls something out. He
then nudges Rose who jumps slightly and looks to what Greg
has in his hand. A THIN SMALL COMPUTER. It looks like a
calculator with an extra large screen. Gregory whispers:

GREGORY
It makes shapes out of sound waves.

He turns it on. Rose watches. The little screen bursts into
color as the music creates fantastic forms and spirals. She
smiles in fascination. Gregory is pleased it's made an
impression, They watch together like two children.

INT. AVERY FISHER ~ RECEPTION - NIGHT.

An after concert reception. Rose and Gregory stand in the
crowd with white wine and hor d'oeuvres. Rose bites into one.

Rose notices alot of lights and crowds through the window,
looking over to the N.Y. State Theatre.

ROSE
What's happening over there?

GREGORY
I read somewhere it's a midnight
celebrity benefit for Dance Theatre
of Harlem and AIDS.

ROSE
I bet they have better food.

GREGORY
We don't have invitations.

Rose has a devious and mischievous look on her face.

EXT. LINCOLN CENTER ~ NIGHT.

Gregory stands in the cold, in his tux, watching -

Rose approaching the line of paparazzi, awaiting celebrity
arrivals. Limousines pull up to the curb and cameras start
flashing at whoever exits. During a lull, Rose whistles over
TWO YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHERS and brings them into a huddle.
Gregory is intrigued as he watches Rose give them directions
and money. He sees the photographers shrug and nod to Rose.
Rose returns to Gregory.

GREGORY
What are you doing?

ROSE
You're sort of a scientist. I'm going
to show you an example of chain
reaction. Come on!
She grabs his hand and walks quickly toward the curbs.
EXT. CURBSIDE - NIGHT.

Rose leads Gregory towards a limousine that is parked, having
already deposited its celebrity. Gregory is worried.

GREGORY

all the ways he sneaks into parties.
I always wanted to try it. I mean

humiliated? I spent a lot of money on
this dress and I'm not taking it off
yet! You got a twenty?

Gregory searches for a bill.
EXT. NEW YORK STATE THEATRE - NIGHT.

Celebrities exit a limo and are immediately photographed at
every angle by the photographers as they walk along the red
carpet and are swept into the theatre.

Another limo drives up and out of it exit ROSE AND GREGORY.
Gregory is clearly nervous. They move down the red carpet.
For a few steps nothing happens. Gregory almost panics. Until
suddenly, the two photographers Rose paid off start clicking
the cameras furiously at them.

Like a chain reaction, ALL THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS start
clicking their cameras. Rose's plan worked. Rose begins to
enjoy her momentary celebrity, playing it for all it's worth.
Gregory is amazed as they reach the door and are quickly
swept inside by the doorman.

INT. NY STATE THEATRE ~ NIGHT.

Rose is busy at the buffet table. Gregory is stunned and
exhilarated!

ROSE

Here he is ~ my hunter gatherer.

GREGORY
They didn't have any more roast beef

skewers instead.

ROSE
Fine. Fine. Sit down,

Placing the dishes on the stairs, Rose begins to prepare a
bite for herself - redoing two hor d'oeurves by replacing
\ bits of one with another. Gregory watches intently.

things and I can't stand cucumber

inflamed desires for people they've
only sat alone in a parlor with.
Holding hands becomes the most
intimate act.

ROSE
And all those layers of clothing
they've have to get through to even
make a move. So erotic.

Gregory laughs. Rose smiles.

Rose stops, losing her smile. Gregory is worried.

ROSE
Well then we should definitely not go
any further.

GREGORY
I don't agree. I know the whole "on
the rebound" scenario and believe me
that's not what this is. I don't want
what I had with her. I want something
else. I want everything you've been
talking about in that classroom.

ROSE
But ...

GREGORY
There are no guarantees Rose. There's
no perfect science ~ it's still all
depends on how a person sees it. And
when I see you I see a woman unlike
any I've known. Your mind, your
humor, your passion for ideas, your
courage to live by them ...

Rose is being swept off her feet.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
What would happen if we put
everything else - the sex, the
romantic illusions - and put them
aside. Got to real know each other's
heart and soul, like those knights
and ladies of the 12th century.

But they had passion for each. They
just sacrificed it.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Have I... overstepped the boundaries?

Speechless, Rose shakes her head. They walk side by side in
silence for a moment. Until:

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Rose?
(they stop)
May I hold your hand then?

Rose finds this so moving, she can only nod. Gregory takes
her hand and they walk past camera. With their backs to us,

were many photographers uh, taking
pictures.

The class is bored stiff. Gregory can't tell a story.

Jesse but, after this last time, I
made a decision I don't ever want to

uncomfortable.

GREGORY
Actually it does, but that's OK. I
never got to really know any of
them - I guess I just wasn't
interested until Jess. She was so ...
dangerous. Why are we attracted to

night classes and we got friendly.
It's so stupid. We used to sit in
coffee and share cigarettes. Talk. I
guess I built this whole fantasy of
him on those little things. Like
sharing cigarettes. It seemed like
such an intimate thing to do at the
time. And I don't even smoke. I

and in a way I'm glad because it's
finally over. I don't have to...
fantasize anymore.

Gregory nods. Rose eats one of his french fries. Pause.

GREGORY
You know, I've always been fascinated
by people's fascination with this
game. I don't see the point of
playing a game in which you exert all
that effort to wind up at the same
place you started?

Rose considers this but doesn't have an answer.

had season tickets.
Someone gets a hit and a run is scored.

where he started - mathematically
this’ game has no point.

ROSE
(lying) |
Well, actually it's about averages.
I mean that's what makes it exciting.

GREGORY
Averages?

ROSE
Yeah, see that scoreboard. Everytime
a player comes up they flash that
three digit number. Well that's the
players average ~ how many times he
hit the ball in ratio to how many.
times he stood up at bat. You're
dealing with several pitches coming
per time at bat ...And what a man can
do with these several pitches is
actually about pitting the man and
his skill against his average. It's
man versus the numbers because if he
can't maintain or surpass his
average, his contract gets cancelled
or he gets traded which is tantamount
to public humiliation...

Intrigued, Gregory pulls out a pad and pencil.

GREGORY
Now which number is it?

jaws drop in admiration as he takes off his jacket to reveal

the outline of his torso. Gregory is clearly self-conscious,

Some students nod cautiously in disbelief.

GREGORY (Cont'd)

Let me put this before you. Let's say
Marakesh's contract states that he
must keep his average at 285 for a
period of at least 33 of the 52 game

music, post 1799. I have an idea for
examining harmonic proportions.

ROSE
OK.

GREGORY
I can't thank you enough. I was a
better teacher today than I've ever
been because of you.

Rose smiles, deeply touched. A WAITER brings them two salads,
then offers:

WAITER
Fresh pepper?

Rose is about to answer when:

GREGORY
She doesn't like pepper, but I will.
And you can you bring her a side dish
of extra dressing. She likes a little
extra.

Rose is so moved by this gesture she can't take her eyes off
of Gregory, who proceeds to cut his his salad, oblivious to
how much that mean to Rose. She can hardly eat. Gregory
continues talking MOS = but Rose just stares at him, as if
abut to cry.

Her class awaits her arrival, talking amongst themselves.
Suddenly the door opens and they all look 0.S. in surprise.

A CAMERA PAN beginning from Rose's feet up her body reveals
A NEW LOOK - heels, shapely albeit full calves, a hemline
that starts at the knee outlining a tight fitting dress that
hugs her hips, waist, torso and breast...The look is
reminiscent of the sensuality of an Anna Magnani. Even though
a tummy shows and the behind spreads, their is an air of
defiant sexuality. She looks great (at least to this writer).
Rose obviously feels self-conscious, but bravely enters and
decides to stick by herself.

The class, especially the boys, are in shock. Rose looks at
them in silence and says;

ROSE
Yes. I have tits.

The class cracks up and the ice is broken.

of sharing his life. And Rose is surrendering.

INT. MET OPERA - NIGHT.

Gregory and Rose listen to TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, as they share
his sound wave hand computer. Rose decides to take the
computer away and force Gregory to close his eyes and just
listen.

DISSOLVE TO:

Rose looks over to Gregory and notices his eyes are tearing

man who is so open to experience and the world she can show
him. She covertly offers him a tissue. He accepts.

Gregory dances to good old rock music - some Rolling Stones

his dances without inhibition, surrendering to the music.

INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Rose is getting dressed just as frantically as she always
has. At her vanity, she opens her drawer of cosmetics and
cupcakes. Fishing around the mess, she finds and un-opened
bottle of PERFUME. She bravely tears off the wrapping and
cautiously applies some to her wrist. Liking it, she applies
it to a variety of spots.

INT. ROSE AND HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.
Rose opens front door revealing Gregory.

GREGORY
Hi. Am I late?

ROSE
(nods)
About twenty years. You look great.

Gregory enters and hands Rose some wine. He coughs from the
perfume. Rose put on a bit too much.

ROSE (Cont'd)
Did I put on too much?

CONTINUED:

68.

GREGORY
No. It's nice. Just certain scents
make my eyes water.

ROSE
I'll go shower.

GREGORY
(laughs)
No. Don't. Where's your mother?

ROSE
Getting dressed. You'll know when she
enters the room ~ there'll be a
musical cue. Want to open this for me?

HANNAH (0.S.)
Rose ... has our guest arrived.

Rose and Gregory turn to see Hannah, ever so gracefully
entering from the bedroom hallway, wearing a beautiful outfit
with coiffed hair and jewelry. A stark contrast to Rose's

apron and

jeans. She oozes charm and flirtatiousness.

Coincidentally, at that same moment, an ice-cream truck

passes by
whispers j

They both

on the street with it's Mr. Softee jingle. Rose
okingly to an amused Gregory.

ROSE
See, I told you.

GREGORY
I've been looking forward to meeting
you Mrs, Morgan.

HANNAH
Welcome. Welcome. You look very nice.
See, Rose - Gregory dressed for
dinner. What's that smell?
(Rose winces)
It seems odd that we haven't met
after all this time.

GREGORY
I thought so too.

look to Rose who wants to get this over with.

ROSE
My fault! Dinner's ready.

She exits into the kitchen. Hannah smiles at Gregory.
INT. DINING ROOM ~- NIGHT.

The table is beautifully set. Hannah and Gregory sit in
silence. Gregory notices the folded three-cornered napkins
and the meticulous detail with which Rose has prepared. 0S,
DONOVAN'S "SEASON OF THE WITCH" is playing much to Hannah's
annoyance.

HANNAH
Can we please have some silence
during dinner?
(to Gregory)
She either has her music playing or
the television. God forbid we should
have a conversation.

Rose shuts it off, enjoying Hannah's irritation. Rose enters
the dining room and sets down a beautiful platter of gourmet
food.

ROSE
I hope you like it - it's a Viennese
dish. My father was haif-Viennese.

GREGORY
(Impressed)
My God Rose it's...it's art.

ROSE
(laughs)
No.

GREGORY

No it is. An artist isn't just a
painter or sculptor. It's someone
that sets a table a certain way or
prepares food a certain way...0Or
teaches a certain way.

(sincerely)
You are an artist, Rose.

Rose is thrilled by the comment. They look to Hannah for
confirmation.

CONTINUED:

HANNAH
We should have separate dishes for
the salad Rose - use the Villeroy
Boch underneath the breakfront.
Please, Gregory - help yourself.
There's plenty. Rose and IT don't eat
very much.

Rose retrieves the salad plates and returns to the table.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
And we never eat meat unless it's a
special occasion. Especially this
rich.

Gregory wonders about this. Rose is irritated by the lie. She
sits and Hannah passes her the salad. Rose puts down the.
salad and moves for the meat platter which Gregory helps her
with.

GREGORY
It's delicious.

Hannah gives Rose a stare as she piles her plate with meat.

HANNAH
Rose?

ROSE
What?!

Mother and daughter's irritation builds. Gregory hands Rose
the bread.

GREGORY
You have to dip the bread in this
gravy ~ it's amazing.

Rose smiles and takes the bread. The two are enjoying their
meal as Hannah quietly eats her salad, feeling thwarted.

HANNAH
You know, my younger daughter Claire
is getting married at the end of the
month. I hope Rose has invited you to
come instead of insisting on going
alone. I know she would so appreciate
having someone there with here since-

ROSE
Mother!
HANNAH
(innocently)
What?

Rose feels embarrassed. Gregory throw her a smile as if to
say, “It's all right".

GREGORY
Well, I-haven't been asked yet but
I'm secretly hoping I am.
(Rose smiles)
Maybe you can put in a good word for
me, Mrs. Morgan.

Hannah smiles falsely. Rose smirks gratefully to Gregory.
INT. KITCHEN ~- LATER THAT NIGHT.
Rose and Hannah are fighting.

ROSE
You had no right to say that!

HANNAH
This is my house. I can say what I
like. And I'm telling you ~ you're
going to lose this one if you don't
watch out.

ROSE
Oh please!

HANNAH
Two servings of veal! Was that
necessary? You think men marry women
who wipe their plates clean?

ROSE
We are not getting married. And he
likes the way I eat!

HANNAH
Well then there's something wrong
with him. He's a good looking man.
You think men like that are
interested -

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

Rose breaks a plate on purpose. Hannah is shocked into
silence.

ROSE
Don't you dare say what you're about
to say to me.

Rose is so threatening in her tone, Hannah retreats and
exits. Rose is shaken, but pulls herself together.

cuT TO:
INT. ART GALLERY ~ DAY.

A sign tells us it is an exhibition of a modern Hungarian
painter from the forties and fifties. Gregory leads Rose by
the hand - Rose is wearing a multi-colored sundress with a
revealing neckline and a wild picture hat.

ROSE
What? What are we seeing?

GREGORY
We're almost there.

Gregory leads her to a PAINTING - a six foot portrait of a
beautiful women with flaming red hair, half nude, wearing
only a camisole that is slipping off her body as she stands
before a sunlit window. The woman looks very similar to
Jessie. Rose looks at the picture.

ROSE
My God. She's beautiful.

GREGORY

She's my mother.

(Rose is fascinated)
She lived in Europe after she left my
father and me. We didn't hear
anything for years until an associate
of my father's told us she was seen
with this Hungarian painter who was
starting to make a name for himself.
He apparently took his work back to
Hungary with him and it wasn't until
the Eastern Bloc fell that his work
came to the states.

ROSE
Wow. Is she ... still alive?

COWTIMUED
73.

CONTINUED:

GREGORY
No. She died of cancer during my
second year at Harvard. She was
living with her fifth husband in
Seattle. I liked him. I went to all
the weddings. We always spent her
last night as a free woman together.
That's what she'd call it. I'd even
help her get dressed for the
ceremony. I remember being
fascinated watching her put on make-
up. I'd watch this ritual over and
over until I knew exactly the moment
when she would reach for the eyeliner
er blend in her rouge.

Rose listens, seeing the wounded boy inside Gregory for the
first time.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
But then every boy thinks they're
mother is beautiful, huh? I come to
see it whenever they give a showing
of his work ... But I've ... never
brought anyone before.

Rose is so touched. She reaches for his hand and holds it
tight. She is falling in love with this man. Gregory squeezes
her hand affectionately. It is a tender moment until ~-

ALEX (0.S.)
Rose?

Rose is startled to see Alex approaching. Without thinking,
she abruptly lets go of Gregory's hand ~ a gesture both she
and Gregory notice. Alex kisses her helio. Rose feels
embarrassed by her knee-jerk reaction.

ROSE
Alex. Hi. Uh, this is Gregory Larkin.

They shake hands, Gregory meeting Rose's secret love for the
first time.

ALEX
I was with Morgan. He lets me in the
backroom to see the private stash.
(to painting)
This is a pretty one. What is it?

CONTINUED
74,

CONTINUED: (2)

Gregory is uncomfortable as is Rose.

. ROSE
Yes, We were just wondering who the
artist was.

Gregory is grateful for Rose not revealing his secret. Rose
feels awful for reacting as she did in Alex's presence.

CUT TO:
EXT. JEEVES DRY CLEANERS - DAY.

Gregory exits the dry cleaners with his tuxedo. He walks down
the street. He passes by a NEWS STAND displaying a variety of
magazines and tabloids. He stops suddenly. He turns back to
the next stand. Something caught his eye. He moves toward one
particular magazine - a Parisian fashion monthly. He picks it
up to read the cover

INT. GREGORY'S BEDROOM - DAY.

Camera pans the tuxedo laying on the bed as the PHONE RINGS.
The answering machine picks up.

ROSE (V.0.)
Greg it's me ... Listen, I have to go
with Claire to the church so you have
two choices ...

Camera pans to magazine cover which reads: POETESS WEDDING TO
GREEK BANKING KING. A photo of JESSICA in a wedding dress,
poised beside an older but dignified looking Greek gentleman.

ROSE (Cont'd)
You can either go with my mother,
which would qualify you for
sainthood, or just meet us at the
church. Either way is fine. Give me
a call. Bye.

Gregory sits despondently. His heart sinks.
curT TO:
INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM ~ DAY.
It is the day of Claire's wedding. Rose sits at her vanity
wearing her maid of honor dress, trying to figure out some

way she can look prettier.

CONTINUED
75.

CONTINUED:

She tries as shake of lipstick on her upper lip. She's not
sure. She tries a different shade on her lower lip. She then
flips lips back and forth until she gives up and wipes them
off. Next, she’ tries her straight hair - pull it back, up,
over her ears. She lets it go. This is difficult for her. She
pulls open her drawer and takes out a cookie. Changing her
mind, she tosses it into the garbage. THE PHONE RINGS. She
hesitates before picking it up - having a bad premonition.

ROSE
Hello?

INTERCUT :
INT, GREGORY'S APT. ~ DAY.

Gregory ~- half dressed - having a difficult time speaking.
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATIONS:

GREGORY
It's me.

ROSE
Hi. I haven't heard from you in a
couple of days. Everything all right?

GREGORY
I don't know. I woke up ... feeling
a little dizzy ... and uh ...

ROSE
Do you have a temperature?

GREGORY
I think I might ... I don't have a
thermometer.

ROSE
Well you should stay home ... get in
bed.

GREGORY

Yeah I... I think I should ... I'm
so sorry Rose.

ROSE
(disappointed)
It's OK. Really. Take care of
yourself. I'll call you tomorrow. OK?

She hangs up. She acts as if she knows the truth. She rises
from her vanity and sits on the edge of her bed to put on her
shoes. On her bed lays A WOMEN'S FASHION MAGAZINE ~- opened to
the same magazine on which Jessie appears. She stares at
Jessie and feels foolish for thinking seriously about Greg.

cuT TO:
EXT. CHURCH - DAY.

A beautiful country church - complete with steeple and grassy
grounds. A figure in a bridesmaid gown rushes into the church.

cuT TO:
INT. CHURCH HALLWAY —- DAY.

ROSE, the woman in the bridesmaid gown, enters out of breath
and speaks to CLAIRE, the bride, who is pacing up and down;

ROSE
I don't know where she is.

CLAIRE
I'11 kill her! I knew she'd do this
to me! She can't stand I'm the one
getting the attention today. Old
bitch! We should have had her
committed when she turned sixty.

ROSE
Claire - you can't have someone
committed for excessive vanity.

HANNAH (0.S.)
Thank you Rose.

Rose and Claire turn to the entrance to see HANNAH in an A
SEQUINED LOW CUT, SLINKY GOWN with a slit up the middle. She
holds a brown paper bag.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
It's comforting to have one
compassionate daughter. Fix your
bust, Rose. It's going in two
directions.

Rose begins to adjust herself, like a Pavlovian reflex.
Enraged, Claire stares at the sexy dress in exasperation.

CLAIRE
What the hell are you wearing?

HANNAH
This happens to be a Scassi!

CLATRE
You are the mother of the bride! You
are not the "opening act"!

HANNAH
(insulted)
Fine! I'll go home and change.

CLAIRE
Oh shut-up. Everybody's waiting. The
priest is starting to sweat.

HANNAH
All celibates sweat - if they didn't,
they'd explode.

CLAIRE
Just as a reminder, today is MY day
«+. MY FUCKING DAY! And if you don't
behave, I'm gonna have your birth
certificate blown up as a Christmas

card.

HANNAH 5
I should have never encouraged you to
speak.

ROSE ushers her through the chapel doors. HANNAH smiles at
everyone, as they "ooo" and “aah" at her loveliness... She
walks down the aisle - taking as much time as a bride aight.
Rose and Claire watch from the hallway.

CLAIRE
Look at Alex ... He's so nervous.

Rose looks at ALEX - yet thinking of Gregory.
CLAIRE (Cont'd)
That best man is cute ... Tch ... Oh
decision, decisions ... Your turn!
Go! Go!

COMTINUED

CONTINUED: (2)

She pushes Rose into the aisle. Rose doesn't like all the
eyes staring at her - she knows she doesn't look that pretty
in her pumpkin organza gown. She stares straight ahead,
careful to avoid Alex's eyes as she arrives at the altar.

Claire makes her way down. Everyone stands. Rose admires her
sister's beauty and poise. She discreetly glances over to Alex

FANTASY:

Alex looks over to Rose and mouths the words, "I REALLY LOVE
YoU". Rose smiles and nods understandingly. Suddenly:

GREGORY (0.S.)
ROSE!

Everyone looks to the back of the church. GREGORY HAS .
ARRIVED. He runs down the aisle, pushing Claire aside, hops
over the altar and grabs Rose in his arms much to the shock
of Alex, the priest, Hanmah and the entire congregation. THEY
KISS.

REALITY:

Rose watches Alex watching Claire with great love - wondering
if anyone would ever look at her like that.

INT. HOTEL RECEPTION HALL ~ NIGHT.

The party is in full swing. Rose wanders through the guests
with a full plate of buffet food, sitting down at a table
with Hannah. Hannah glares at her. Rose doesn't care. A
drunken, carefree Alex arrives on the scene. He puts his arm
around Rose, who is made immediately uncomfortable.

ALEX
Have you seen Claire? I can't find
her.

ROSE

(rises, taking his
arm off her)
Uh no..I'1l find her for you.

ALEX
Thanks. You look beautiful tonight
Rose.

ROSE
{not believing him)
Thanks.

ALEX
No, I'm not just saying that. you
really look really beautiful.

ROSE
I heard you. Why don't you go have
some coffee. I'1l find Claire.

Rose exits; Alex turns to Hannah to explain;

ALEX
I'm serious. I'm not being nice.
HANNAH
(sarcastically polite)

I know.

Rose makes her way through the reception hall when she hears
the band play a fanfare. She turns to the bandstand and sees
Claire poised there, ready to throw her bouquet.

BANDLEADER

OK ... we'd like all the single

ladies up here on the dancefloor. Our

bride's going to toss the bouquet.
Not being able to stand this, Rose makes a hasty exit.
INT. EMPTY BALLROOM ~- NIGHT.
In an empty hotel ballroom, Rose sits by herself at a piano.
Rose is playing a beautiful melody that echoes throughout the
empty space. She is quietly crying as she hears the cheers
and laughter from the ballroom nearby.

Behind her, at the entrance - GREGORY APPEARS wearing a
tuxedo. He quietly crosses to her.

GREGORY
I didn't know you played piano.

Rose is startled but hides her surprise with coolness.

ROSE
Mother thought I needed something
growing up. It was either piano or a
nose job. What are you doing here?

GREGORY
I... came to apologize. Rose, I
wasn't really sick ... I was-

ROSE
I know. It was Jessie ... I read
about it. You don't have to do this.
You certainly didn't have to dress up
to do this.

GREGORY
I'm sorry. I wanted to be here for
you. Are you all right?

ROSE
Fine. Like I said, I don't have to
fantasize anymore.
(adds)
About anyone.

GREGORY
Rose, I want to ask you something.

ROSE
Gregory, I think we should stop
seeing each -

GREGORY
Please. Before you say that, just
listen. Because I can only say this
once. I've been sitting in ny
apartment for days thinking it out so
don't feel as if I'm being impulsive.
Rose ... I'm very ... very fond of
you. When I'm with you I feel ina
strange way as if - I'm home. I think
we ... I think we're great together.
And I think ...

ROSE
What are you saying?

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

(2)

GREGORY

Well whatever it is, I'm saying it
wrong, aren't I? This feeling you
have for Alex - I know it isn't the
same with me. But I think ... we have
a kind of love that doesn't look like
anything else. It's may be difficult
to pinpoint but I believe it's there.
We have a passion for knowledge and
for all that life can show us instead
of a passion for each other. But's
it's real. I know I've never
mentioned it before but I had hoped
you could feel it. In our own way, I
believe we love other.

(pause)
I think we should get married.

Rose is stunned. Her mind is racing.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
I know what you're thinking? We
haven't had sex. If this were 1900
that wouldn't be a question but since
it's not all I can say is - it's not
that important to me. What we have
instead, is. I figure we'll just let
the rest of it happen naturally.
(Rose is speechless)
Our experiences with love in the past
have left us miserable. But, perhaps,
there was an order to it. Perhaps, it
led us here.

ROSE
(pause, then:)
I know this is going to sound really
stupid but ... all I keep thinking of
is - how can I marry someone I've
never even kissed?

Bl.

Gregory considers this then, very slowly, carefully, sits
down beside Rose and gently kisses her-

GREGORY
Any other considerations?

Just one question. This is really
happening, isn't it?

INT. ROSE & HANNAH'S APARTMENT ~ NIGHT.

Rose sits at her vanity, still in her bridesmaid gown. Rose
enters, already dressed for bed.

HANNAH
What are you doing? What's wrong?

Rose hesitates for a moment - then decides to tell her.

ROSE
Gregory proposed to me.
HANNAH
WHAT! ?
ROSE
A man proposed to me. Do you want a
valium!?
HANNAH

But ... you hardly know this man. You
said it wasn't that kind of
relationship. You said you've never
even been physical with him.

ROSE
I haven't.

HANNAH
{shocked)
And you said yes!?

ROSE
Yes. He wants me. He wants ME! Maybe
not the way you and Claire were
wanted but wanted just the same.

HANNAH
To cook and clean for him probably.

Well then it won't be much different
from living here.

ROSE (Cont'd)
Look, I admit it isn't your average
marriage proposal but -

(vulnerably)

Nothing else is coming, we both know
that - this may be it for me. He says
he loves me in his way. Maybe that's
all I can have.

HANNAH

You're in love with him aren't you?
ROSE

No I ...
HANNAH

(strong, curt)
Listen to me, my darling daughter. I
may have made a great many mistakes
when it came to you so I know you
have no respect for my opinion. But
if you marry this man loving hin,
knowing he doesn't love you in the
same way - he'll hate you for it. I
know. I was never "in love" with your
father “that way". I married him
because I knew he adored me and
always would but after a while that
adoration became insufferable to me.
I couldn't stand him touching me.
Every gesture had this pathetic plea
to love him in return and I simply
couldn't do it. That he died first
and so early was his good fortune.

ROSE
Poor daddy.

HANNAH -
It was torture for me! And it's the
same torture you'll be putting him
through.

For a moment, Rose believes her. But she fights back.

You'll say anything to keep me here,

being alone and your jealous ~
jealous of someone finding something
in me worth wanting! You know you
can't compete with Claire but me! A
man wanting me! How ridiculous! Well
ya know something mother - a man
does! So you can just eat your
fucking heart out!

¢she rises)
Do you honestly believe that by
keeping me this spinster daughter,
your beauty lasts any longer? You're
getting old mom. And there's nothing
that I can do about it.

Hannah is stung by the truth of Rose's words as Rose exits.

CUT TO:
INT. CITY HALL - DAY.

Gregory and Rose, both in suits, stand in front of a judge,
with witnesses Henry on one side and Doris on the other.
Hannah is not present. As the judge speaks, Rose notices
things around the office that don't exactly fit a romantic's
dream wedding; An old Mr. Coffee half full with dirty coffee
mugs and coffee grinds around a used filter... Dirty, grimy
windows looking out over gray office buildings with pigeons
perched on them... The judges clerk, a bored black woman,
eating her bag lunch and reading a Danielle Steele book.

Rose looks to Gregory who faces the judge with an immobile
expression. She then looks over to Doris, who offers a
sympathetic smile - as if Doris understands. Rose smiles back
gratefully.... She turns, hoping she's making the right
choice.

cuT TO:
INT. GREGORY (AND ROSE'S) BEDROOM ~ DAY.

GREGORY'S BED HAS BEEN REPLACED BY TWO TWIN BEDS with
bureaus. Rose unpacks her things into her bureau. She moves
about the room with a tentativeness. She moves to Gregory's
bureau. She examines his things - a book, an extra pair of
glasses, a cologne, a box of cufflinks and tie-pins - with
care and curiosity. These are her husband's things. The
thought flashes across her mind. Gregory enters.

Rose returns to her un-packing.

GREGORY
I've’ made some room on the shelves
for your books. I've put those boxes
in the living room. Are you finding
everything easily?

ROSE
Yes. I'm finished. All unpacked.

A wedding night nervousness pervades.

GREGORY
So, uh, what would you like to do?
ROSE
(casually)
Go to bed ...
(quickly)
To sleep. To sleep in bed. Go to bed
to sleep.
GREGORY

It's been a long day. I have an early
student's meeting. When do you have
to get up?

(fixing the alarm)

ROSE
My first class is at ten.

GREGORY
I'll try not to wake you.

Pause. They stand awkwardly opposite each other.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Would you like to use the bathroom
first?

ROSE
Great. Yes. Thanks.

She takes her robe and things and exits into bathroom.
Gregory takes a breath and begins to undress. He takes off
his tie and methodically folds it onto a tie rack where other
ties lay in prefect order. He undoes his shirt, puts it on a
hanger and buttons it up again fastidiously.

Seeing Gregory in nothing but his underwear, Rose freezes.
Gregory also doesn't know where to put his eyes or hands. He

Hahaha...um....

GREGORY

ROSE
OK ... Yeah ... Yes. Washcloths!

GREGORY
Under the sink.

She closes the door. Gregory quickly puts on his robe. He
realizes this is more difficult than he thought.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT.

Gregory is asleep. Rose's bed is unmade, but empty. Camera
pans around to Rose, sitting in a chair by the window,
drinking a cup of tea quietly. She wears men's pajamas and
robe. She rises. She crosses to a mirror and looks at herself
and her wedding ring. She is now a married woman. She wonders
if she looks any differently. She sees a shopping bag by her
bureau containing an unwrapped present. She takes the bag
into the bathroom, closing the door.

INT. BATHROOM ~ NIGHT.
Removing the box, she opens it and reads a gift card: FOR A
MARRIED LADY...I WANT POLAROIDS OF THE WEDDING NIGHT - LOVE

YOU, DORIS. Rose smiles. She lifts a beautiful negligee out

Rose and Gregory walk hand in hand. Rose notices young girls
noticing them and she likes it. They reach a place where they
must separate. For an awkward moment, they don't know how to
kiss each other. Finally they give each other a quick peck on
the cheek. Gregory exits. Rose looks frustrated.

INT. GREGORY'S CLASS ~ DAY.

In jeans and a sweater, Gregory continues his new, popular
teaching style.

INT. BEDROOM ~ NIGHT.

Rose is reading in bed. Gregory is in the bathroom with the
door half open. Rose can't heip but sneak a peak from the bed
to the mirror inside the bathroom, where she sees Gregory
stepping out of the shower. When he reaches for a towel, his
arm shuts the door - cutting off Rose's view. She returns to
her book.

Rose stops to buy flowers on the street with Henry's neweat

GREGORY
So how old is she?

HENRY
Twenty-three. I met her at a Paul
Bunyon Shadow seminar. She served the
juice. I have to tell you - Having
sex with someone that young, who
hasn't experienced the same history
as you is mind blowing. I'm buried

So, how about you. Looks like it's
going well.

GREGORY
Better than that.

HENRY
She looks different from the wedding
day.

GREGORY
Different? How?

HENRY
No I mean that in a good way. Have
you two... ?

GREGORY
No, and it hasn't made a bit of
difference.

But we can tell that Henry's sexual escapades have left an
impression of yearning in Gregory.

Meanwhile, Rose asks the Brunette, incredulously.

ROSE
How many times?

BRUNETTE
Five. He has incredible stamina. I

However you wish to dress is for you

Oh, new season. New clothes.

An awkward moment of silence. As they approach the entrance
to Carnegie Hall, an 0.S. VOICE CALLS:

Rose turns to see BARRY NEUFELD arm in arm with A PLAIN WOMAN
NAMED GLORIA - shorter and heavier than Rose, with a huge

GLORIA
(ecstatic)
Thank you!

BARRY
Yep, finally found someone who like
my tricks.

They laugh, albeit somewhat uncomfortably. But Barry and
Gloria are truly crazy about each other. Barry hugs her
tighter and kisses her hand. There is physical affection
between the two. Rose is very moved by the gesture.

ROSE
I'm really happy for you.

BARRY
Thanks. You too! Better go in huh.

They all begin to enter...Rose with Gregory by her side but
not touching. Barry and Gloria walk with his arm hugging her
waist. Rose can't help but notice.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL ~ NIGHT.

Greg and Rose sit together listening to STRAUSS' OVERTURE TO
"DER ROSENKAVALIER". The music is lush and romantic. She
glances over to Barry and Gloria, who sits with Barry's arm
around her shoulder. They never seem to be further away than
a touch. They seem so happy to her. Rose feels a little sad.
Gregory takes out his sound wave computer. Rose smiles at
him - but it's not the same.

INT. GREGORY & ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
Gregory is on the floor finishing sit-ups as Rose hold his
feet down, with a towel around her neck. He is bare-chested
and sweaty. Rose eyes him with lustful longing.

FANTASY:

Gregory stops his sit-ups and stares back at her. Suddenly,
he lunges toward Rose and gives her a passionate Kiss as he
rolls on top of her.

REALITY:

CONTINUED:

Gregory finishes up his last sit-up with A MOAN OF PLEASURE.
Rose moves behind him to towel wipe his back and neck.

Thanks.

GREGORY

Gathering up her courage, Rose decides to make a move. She
turns the wipe down into a massage, rubbing deeper and deeper
into his back, moving her hands down the front of his body.
Gregory suddenly gets nervous and tenses up.

GREGORY (Cont'd)

ow!
ROSE
(stops)
oh! Sorry! Was that too hard?
GREGORY
(vises)

No ... that's OK. I'm all sweaty. I
should shower and uh ... I have to

floss.

ROSE
Well, when you gotta floss, you gotta
floss.

He exits into the bathroom. Rose sits on the floor
frustrated. We hear a crash in the bathroom. Gregory exits
holding an old cup of coffee.

GREGORY
Rose ... please ... could you
remember not to leave your morning
coffee in the bathroom

ROSE
Sure. Sorry.

GREGORY
Thank you.

He reenters the bathroom. Rose remains on the floor -
disappointed and frustrated.

CUT TO:
92.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Rose is cooking as she listens to DYLAN'S "STUCK INSIDE A
MOBILE WITH THOSE MEMPHIS BLUES AGAIN" blasting on the living
room stereo. Gregory enters and yells over the music.

GREGORY
Hi.

ROSE
Hi.

There is a coolness between then.

Before he
turns off

GREGORY
Would you mind terribly if we put
something else on during dinner? I
was wondering if maybe you'd like to-

can finish, Rose marches out of the kitchen and
the stereo. Gregory is surprised by her abruptness.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
We didn't have to take it off now. I
only meant ...

ROSE
Gregory - you don't like Dylan. You
want to put on opera put it on.

GREGORY
Not if you don't want -

ROSE
Gregory, put the damn opera on!

GREGORY
(intimidated)
Which one would you like?

ROSE
What's the difference as long as it's
someone singing about death and
suicide.

GREGORY
Well not all opera is -

ROSE
Gregory! That was not an invitation
to an opera lesson OK.

GREGORY
Rose, are you upset about something?

CONTINUED
93.

CONTINUED:

ROSE
Look! You don't like Dylan, just say
so - don't act like it's just a
suggestion you're making and then
turn it around so suddenly it's ME
who chooses what fucking opera what
we hear!

GREGORY
Why are you angry?

ROSE
Because I feel like it! Don't you
ever shout or lose control or feel
angry for no apparent good reason!?

GREGORY
I don't see the point. It's not very
constructive.

ROSE
No, it's just human.

GREGORY
Are you're implying I'm not human?

ROSE
I'M NOT IMPLYING! I'M SAYING IT!

Pause. Gregory assess the situation.
GREGORY
Maybe it would be best if we had some
distance tonight and gathered
ourselves. I'11 eat out.
He exits. Rose wants to clobber hin.
INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT.

Rose is in bed reading a book, blasting JIMI HENDRIX from the
living room. A tired Gregory enters. Rose doesn't bother to
look up from her book. Gregory crosses into the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM ~- NIGHT.

Gregory enters to find TEN CUPS OF OLD COFFEE SURROUNDING THE
SINK. His temper rises but he controls it.
94,

INT. BEDROOM -
Gregory asks politely.

GREGORY
If this is a joke, I'm missing it.

Rose puts down her book AND BEGINS TO FLOSS HER TEETH.
GREGORY (Cont'd)
I'm really at a loss here. Can't we
discuss what's ...
The music invades his concentration.
GREGORY (Cont'd)
That music is a little loud. Would
you mind if I...

The guitar licks seem to get louder. Gregory is clearly angry
but holds it back. He yells to be heard.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE THE MUSIC
THIS LOUD?!

Rose jumps to her knees and defiantly pushes her face up to
his.

ROSE
YES!

Face to face, lips almost touching, it looks as if they might
hit each other or -

FANTASY:

Gregory grabs Rose and flings her down. He rips off his shirt
and tie and pounces on her.

REALITY:
GREGORY
I'm really at a loss as to what is
going on here.

Rose deflates. She gets off the bed and exits into the living
room. We hear the music shut off. Gregory stands confused.

EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY.

Rose, Doris and Claire are having lunch. Rose is only playing
with her food while the two others eat heartily.

DORIS
You're making an awful lot of
assumptions. Have you talked to him
about it?
(Rose shakes her head)
Well then how do you know how he
feels?

ROSE
Doris - we never make love! He never
tells me I look pretty. He never ...
looks at me like that.

CLAIRE
Well do you ever look at him like
that?

ROSE

Please - if I looked at him with any
more desire, I'd set him on fire.

CLAIRE
Maybe that's what he needs. Maybe you
have to make the first move. Men are
really stupid, Rose. God gave'em
dicks so they'd have something to
hold onto when they scratch their
heads! Sometimes, I have to bang Ray
over his head just to let him know
I'm in the mood.

DORIS/ROSE
Ray?

ROSE
Who's Ray?

CLAIRE

Ray? Did I say Ray? I mean Alex. Ray!
Hal Who's Ray?

Rose and Deris look at each other suspiciously.

INT. HENRY'S OFFICE - DAY.

A sullen Gregory sits before a sympathetic Henry.

CONTINUED:

HENRY
Have you tried making love?

GREGORY
Well, that's just it. I honestly
haven't had the desire. And what if
if it doesn't work? Our relationship
was never based on that. I love her
a great deal but ...

HENRY
She's not Jess.

GREGORY
That has nothing to do with it.

HENRY
Your publisher called me. He said he
spoke to you about a lecture tour in
London and Paris when your book gets
released next month. Wanted to know
if I would be amenable to replacing
you for the rest of the semester.

GREGORY
(flustered)
I know. I haven't said anything
because I haven't decided if I want
to do it or not.

HENRY
He said the offer came from their
overseas counterpart Beaux Art
Publishing. Isn't that one of the
companies Jessie's new husband owns?

Gregory doesn't answer. Obviously this secret has been
influencing him. Henry begins with what seems like a non-

sequitur:

HENRY (Cont'd)
Do you know that in the past two
years I've been with ... eleven
aifferent women, most of them half my
age. Not one lasted longer than two
months. Some didn't last the night.
Not one of them had a sense of humor
I understood.

HENRY (cont'd)

One girl actually thought A FAREWELL
TO ARMS was a new diet book. I went
to my gym the other day and saw the
most incandescent creature climbing
a Stairmaster. Even her sweat was
perfectly distributed about her body.
I thought she was staring at me the
whole time until I realized she had
head phones on and was looking at MTV
on a monitor behind my head. I went
into the locker room and walked my
naked 56 year old body through a room
of Apollos and sat in a steam room
where I was propositioned by a bald
man with hair on his shoulders. It
was the highlight of my day.

(pause)
Don't give up on this Greggy. You
don't know what you have.

cuT TO:
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT.
Rose is in the kitchen preparing two glasses of wine. She
wears a negligee that's flimsier than anything we've seen her
in. She checks her face in the reflection of the microwave,
then breathes a deep sigh.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT.
Gregory sits up in his bed watching a ballgame. He too looks
anxious as Rose enters with a tray and two glasses. He tries
to cover his anxiety with conversation.

GREGORY
I uh...I have the game on for you.

ROSE
Oh well ... we don't have to watch.

GREGORY
Doesn't matter to me.

ROSE
I bought that wine Henry recommended.

CONTINUED
98.

CONTINUED:

GREGORY
Oh, before bed? I don't know Rose.
T'll wake up with head pressure.

ROSE
No it's white - you said only red
does that.

GREGORY

All right. One glass.

Rose offers him a glass, then sets the tray on her bed,
taking her glass. She stands as they sip.

GREGORY (Cont'd)

Mmm ... good. Fruity. I don't
normally like fruity but this is
good.

Gregory realizes she's standing. He asks gently;

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Do you want to sit down?

ROSE
(acting surprised)
Oh OK.

Rose walks around to the other side of Gregory's bed and sits
down next to him, leaning up against a pillow. They both feel
immediately uncomfortable though pretending they don't. They
sip in silence, each body rigid and detached from the other.
They both have their eyes on the game but neither is
watching. Rose decides to make her move. She sets her glass
on the nightstand then scoots herself up higher on the
pillow. Gregory keeps his eyes straight ahead.

ROSE (Cont'd)
That wine made me warn.

GREGORY
I could lower the thermostat,

ROSE
No, it's OK

Pause. They return to the TV. Rose musters all her courage
and begins to unravel the tie that keeps her nightgown
fastened. She nervously loosens it enough to open the front,
revealing her cleavage and the outline of her breasts.

CONTINUED
99.

CONTINUED: (2)

Gregory, knowing full well what she has done, keeps his eyes
on the set. PAUSE. No one moves ... until -

AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT;

Rose moves to give Gregory a kiss, just as Gregory turns away
to place his glass on the other nightstand. Rose's face butts
Gregory's shoulder, which jolts him forward, knocking over
the wine glass. He tries to retrieve it but, in a split
second, knocks over the lamp instead and throwing the room
into darkness. The only illumination comes from the TV.

GREGORY/ROSE
I'm sorry. No..My fault..Sorry.

Pause. Gregory faces her and asks apprehensively yet bluntly;

GREGORY
Do ... do you want to ...

ROSE
Don't say it.

GREGORY

(logically)

Well maybe if we undress and get into
bed.

ROSE

(acting surprised)
Oh ... all right.

Then stiffly turn away from each other and begin to disrobe.
Then, each slips beneath the covers and lay next to each
other, looking up at the ceiling. Both are clearly nervous
and apprehensive. They turn on their sides to face each
other. The lovemaking that follows is precisely choreographed
in beats; . -

- They begin with passionless, mechanical kisses. Neither one
touching the other. Their feelings in check.

~- Rose begins to feel something first. She plants a kiss on
Gregory that lingers a bit longer. Gregory keeps his eyes
open as Rose begins to lose herself a little.

- Gregory feels it is his move and he chooses to stroke her
hair and face. Rose receives this with some self~-
consciousness.

~ Rose then grabs his hand and pulls him toward her, as she
raps her arms around him and kisses him firmly and
passionately.

~ We can tell Gregory is still a little stiff but this
doesn't hinder Rose. She begins to ravage him, pushing on his
back and kissing his face, neck and shoulders. Gregory begins
to have trouble breathing...Rose kisses him again on the
mouth.

~ Gregory returns the kisses - BUT THERE IS NO PASSION. He's
thinking too hard ~- refusing to let go and open up that part
of him. Rose works even harder; rubbing him, touching him,
kissing his body. But Gregory gives very little in the way of
surrender or response.

~ Rose pulls Gregory back on top of her and he tries to:
enter. She continues touching, kissing and hugging but WE CAN
SEE THAT SHE IS CRYING, knowing that he is not responding.

~ Gregory, working at feeling something, finds that he
cannot. He suddenly stops trying. He pulls himself off of
Rose, who quickly raises the sheet over to her bedy. She
wants to die. Gregory searches for an explanation.

GREGORY
I'm so sorry Rose. I'm...

Rose turns away from him and starts to cry silently; He
doesn't know what to say. He feels very badly.

GREGORY (Cont'd)
Rose?

Rose hides her face, filled with hurt and shame.

ROSE
Please. I just want to go to sleep.

GREGORY
Rose. Listen ... What we have ...
I've never had with a woman what I
share with you ... The way I feel
about myself with you ... the way I
see myself through you. You're so
good for me.

CONTINUED
101.

CONTINUED: (4)

ROSE
(into her pillow)
I can't tell you how tired I am of
being good for people.

Gregory doesn't know what to say. Rose pulls herself together.
ROSE (Cont'd)
I... I really don't want to talk
right now OK? Let's talk tomorrow. I
++. I just want to go to sleep.
Rose turns into her bed. Gregory shuts off the light.

CUT TO:
INT. KITCHEN ~ MORNING.

Gregory, dressed for school, sits as Rose pours his coffee.
She sits opposite him - calmly and collected.

ROSE
I think it would be a good idea if we
had some time apart for a while.
Don't you agree?

GREGORY
If that's what you want.

ROSE
I think it would be a good thing.

GREGORY
I've been offered a lecture tour for
my book. I can start next month.

ROSE
Where?

GREGORY
London and... Paris.

Rose feels a pang of despair when she hears "Paris".

ROSE
Will you see her, do you think?

GREGORY
I don't know Rose,

CONTINUED
102.

CONTINUED:
Pause. Rose smiles to herself.

. ROSE

Wrong answer. Well, anyway, I don't
think I want to wait the month. I
think I'll move back with my mother
for a while. Then when you get back
from Europe, we'll ... we'll see what
we feel, OK?

Gregory nods. He reaches for her hand but Rose moves away
with the excuse: :

ROSE (Cont'd)
I have to get the toast.

She exits into the kitchen. Gregory feels awful.
cuT TO:
INT. ROSE'S OLD BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Rose enters and shuts the door slowly. She takes in the room
for a moment, then removes her coat. She sits down at her
vanity. She looks at herself in the mirror, coldly.

HANNAH enters, in a silk robe and stands in the doorway. She
looks old. As if since Rose's departure, her own age has
suddenly advanced itself. She says coldly.

HANNAH
I have plans tomorrow so if your
things are coming you should tell the
doorman to accept then.

Rose doesn't even flinch, or look in her direction. She

speaks in a deadened tone, void of any sentiment or emotion

as stares into the mirror and remembers; -
ROSE

When I was a little girl you used to

tell me to sleep with my index finger

pushing my nose up, so it wouldn't

droop.

HANNAH
I did not.

CONTINUED
CONTINUED:

103.

ROSE
Yes you did. It's funny what mothers
forget and what daughters remember.
You even suggested I scotch tape my
nose up so I'd be more comfortable.
You told me if I was fat, no one
would ever look at me and smile. And
the funny thing is, I would have
never known I wasn't beautiful if it
wasn't for those things. All those
hours I. wasted wishing I looked like
someone else. All that time.

HANNAH
I'm going to bed.

ROSE
Mom?

HANNAH
What?

ROSE
How did it feel?

HANNAH
How did what feel?

ROSE
Being beautiful?

HANNAH
Please. You're being morbid.

ROSE

(sincerely)

No I mean it. Having people look at
you with such ... recognition?
Looking at yourself with such _
appreciation ... How did it feel?

Hannah seriously considers this and says, with genuine

feeling -

bordering on longing;

HANNAH
It was wonderful.

Two women in silence - one contemplating the future, the
other wishing for the past.

cuT TO:
INT. LONDON HOTEL ~ NIGHT.

Gregory is receiving his dinner from room service. He signs
the check. The waiter leaves. He turns on a classical music
station and sits down to eat. The first thing he sees is a
THREE CORNERED FOLDED NAPKIN. He thinks of Rose.

CUT TO:
INT. DR. WARNER'S OFFICE ~ DAY.

The doctor sits an a computer terminal imputing information
as Rose sits beside him. The terminal has a facsimile of
Rose, with the doctor making additions or subtractions as
they speak.

DR. WARNER

See if we take a little off the chin
and pull this up...

(imputs)
We can take the bump out of the nose
and remove the cartilage here and
maybe build up this area ... We may
also want to do some cheek
reconstruction. How's that?

Warner exchanges seats with Rose. Rose looks at this new
image of herself - with refined, softened features. Although
she loses her own uniqueness, the image is definitely more
recognizably beautiful and feminine.

ROSE
Wow. I look like Bambi.

INT. FRENCH HOTEL LOBBY - DAY.

Gregory is registering at the hotel. A CLERK brings him a
SEALED LETTER with his name on it.

CLERK
This arrived for you yesterday.

Gregory takes the note. The handwriting is distinctly
feminine. The initials "J. A." in the corner. Gregory's heart

curT TO:
EXT. PARK - DAY.

Henry and Rose talk as they stroll. Henry has his arm around
her affectionately.

HENRY
Have you heard from yet?

ROSE
No. I'm sure they're together.

HENRY
I don't think so. Knowing Greg as I
do, he's too much of a gentleman.
He'd probably call to ask for
permission first. I know this may be
hard to believe, but you mean a great
deal to him.

ROSE
A great deal. That's what I am.

HENRY
There are some men who have heen
known to come to their senses about
this sort of thing. .

ROSE

Name one?

(Henry can't)
You men have it made. Love is the
ultimate unequal opportunity. You
guys hire and fire with complete
discrimination. I hate love. It makes
you lose your sense of irony. It
wouldn't be as hard having a man
leave you if he didn't take your
sense of humor with hin.

HENRY
I think men are men because we don't
have the guts to be women. You know
why I sleep with girls?

106.

CONTINUED:

HENRY (cont'd)
Because they are the perfect
symbiosis of all that is possible and
all that is mysterious. Life runs
through them at light speed. As I get
older I realize I'm not so much a
lech as I am a vampire.

They stop. Henry speaks sincerely to Rose.

. HENRY (Cont'd)
I wish to God I had the guts to be
with someone like you.

Rose considers this compliment then says calmly.

ROSE
Fuck you.

Henry shrugs in agreement and they continue walking.
cur TO:
EXT. LES DEUX MAGOT - DAY.

On the Place Saint-Germain-de-Pres, Gregory sits at a large
corner outdoor cafe, DEUX MAGOT. He sits expectantly. A
WHITE LIMOUSINE drives up to the curb. A uniformed driver
gets out and opens the door. Gregory's heart stops.

JESSIE, wearing a beautiful white suit with pearls, looks
every inch the wife of a millionaire. She is stunning.
Gregory can hardly move. She crosses to his table and stands
before hin.

JESSICA
Hi.

Jessie leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Gregory gets
a whiff of her and nearly swoons. She sits.

JESSICA (Cont'd)
Do you know I only found out last
week that you're married. Do I know
her?
(He shakes his head)
It looks good on you.

GREGORY
You look ... breathtaking.

Jessie smiles, genuinely appreciating the remark. A WAITER

Gregory thinks of Rose.

INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM (HANNAH'S APARTMENT) - NIGHT.

Rose sits curled up in her bed watching TV in an old sweat

suit. Hannah enters wearing a simple sweater and pants

outfit. She looks softer than usual, but just as beautiful.

HANNAH
So, have you decided?

ROSE
About what?

HANNAH
The plastic surgery.
(Rose shakes her head)
Well, I want you to know that if you
decided to go through with it - it's
my gift. I'll pay for everything.

ROSE
Why?

HANNAH
What do you mean why? I'm your
mother. I want to do this for you. I
think it's a terrific idea. Get rid
of the old. Start fresh. Get a whole
new outlook on things. And whether or
not this husband of yours come home
wanting to continue or not, you'll

surgery?

Well ... I suppose you can. I just

in case you decide that's what you
want.

Hannah feels very motherly. Rose smiles, seeing this silly
woman who once could hurt her so deeply, as something
endearing, almost innocently unconscious.

HANNAH (Cont'd)

After you left, I rearranged all the
closets and I came across some old
clothes of your fathers. I found
this. I thought you'd get a kick out
of it.

Hannah pulls a photograph out of her purse. Rose looks over
Hannah's shoulder at AN OLD PHOTO OF A PRETTY LITTLE GIRL IN
A PINK DRESS, smiling into the camera.

ROSE
God, she was so pretty.

HANNAH
That's not Claire. That's you.

ROSE IS COMPLETELY TAKEN BY SURPRISE.

ROSE

Me? I never saw this picture.
HANNAH

It was in some terry cloth robe of

his.
Rose takes the picture and stares at it ~- like a buried -
treasure discovered.

HANNAH (Cont'd)
«+. When I'd take you and Claire out,
everyone would comment on you. How
bright you were...Like a flashbuib,
your father would say. You were just
two there.

IT was pretty?

HANNAH
Your father adored you. But you know
that. He never thought of Claire.
Only you. Especially in the early
years, after Claire was born. And
after a while ... even I didn't
occupy his thoughts so much.

ROSE
Stop it. Daddy idolized you.

HANNAH

Because I tortured him if he didn't.
But if I hadn't?

(shrugs)
He thought you were the most
beautiful thing he'd ever seen. I
don't think he'd ever even held a
baby before you came. Having you was
quite an experience for him.

(almost vulnerable)
You said some horrible things to me
I may be a complete monster of a
mother but that doesn't mean I ...

(she can't say it)
No one teaches you how to raise a
child. You don't know what to do
until you're doing it and by then
it's too late. The damage is done.

Rose looks at her mother with great fondness and warmth.

ROSE
Don't flatter yourself Mom. T'm not
that damaged.

Hannah sneaks a smile, then;

HANNAH
So ... you think I need a lift?

ROSE
(sincerely)
No mom ... You're still a very
beautiful woman.

HANNAH

Ah, no ... I'm just an old bag.

Has he called?

ROSE
He left a message when he left
London. He hasn't since he's been in

He's supposed to come home end of
next.

DORIS
Well, no news is good news I guess.

ROSE
Nah, Doris. Good news is good news.
I mean, why settle , right?

I was thinking - how would you feel
about a roommate? Just until I can
get my own place.

Doris stops. She notices the change in Rose and smiles
proudly.

An anxious Jessie sits opposite an anxious Gregory.

JESSIE
I have to admit I'm surprised. You've

marriage?

I didn't know it was that serious.

GREGORY
Isn't yours?

JESSIE

Ha. No. No, it never was. Two months
after the ceremony he informed me he
spends every summer in Greece with
this Polish ballet dancer. Don't be
so surprised. Europeans have a
different way of looking at marriage.
Not that I entirely disagree with it.

GREGORY
You don't seem happy.

JESSIE

I can't be a hypocrite. But - it did
give me a taste of what it could be
like. With the right person. I've
realized something funny Greg. I was
so worried about winding up a wife
with nothing but memories. And all
these years of living my life in
short unconnected perfect moments,
have left me with nothing but
memories. I don't want perfection
anymore.

(genuine)
I want something that'll last.

Gregory is truly taken by her. Yet, he doesn't know whether
to trust her or not. Jessie reaches for his hand. Gregory

takes it.

No. I think you're right.

Rose musters up her courage to let him go.

ROSE
Look, Greg ... I do not regret a
single moment that we have had
together. But I ... I think it was
... a beautiful experiment ... that
failed. And I think we both deserve
to ... find what we really want. T
don't be safe for you anymore. If
Jessie's who you need, they fight for
her Gregory.

Gregory feels overwhelmingly sad.

ROSE (Cont'd)
That's what I'd want. I'd want
someone to scream my name and throw
everything away for me and lose his
mind and not have to be "perfectly
willing to try". I want to be
beautiful to someone. Nothing less
than beautiful.

GREGORY
Rose ... I do lov~ ...

ROSE
Goodbye Greg.

Rose hangs up. She couldn't bear hearing that. Doris enters
and wraps her arms around her friend.

DORIS
Let it go honey. I tell you
something. From where I stand - right
now, you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.
Rose sobs as she hugs Doris.

Gregory slowly hangs up the phone. He is free to be with
Jessie now. But somehow, it doesn't feel right.

They simultaneously bolt for the window to see:
Alex is out on the street, drunk, screaming Rose's name.

DORIS
Jesus, we only had one joint.

SAME LOCATION - MOMENTS LATER.
A drunken Alex is being led into a bedroom by Rose and Doris.

DORIS
I'll go make coffee.

Doris exits. Rose plops Alex down on the bed.

ALEX
(ranting)
You're mother wouldn't give me the
phone number. I knew the building
because I picked Claire up here once.

ROSE
All right calm down Alex. Where is
Claire?

ALEX

She's gone Rose. I came home early
one afternoon and found her fucking
her personal trainer Ray under the
coffee table. It's my fault. Claire
hates surprises.

ROSE
(stunned)
Oh Alex. I'm so sorry.

ALEX
I'm not. I'm relieved actually. At
least now it's in front of me instead
of in my head. I had to see you. I'm

Jessie and Gregory are sitting up in bed, naked, covered by

sheets. It

is clear to us by their faces that they tried to
but it was not successful. Gregory stares ahead as

if he were reading something off the inside of his brain.

GREGORY
This is fascinating.

JESSIE
(worried)
This never happened to us before.
Aren't you ... aren't you still
attracted to me?

GREGORY
I thought I was.
JESSIE
You thought you were?!
GREGORY
Well I'm sorry. I honestly don't know.
JESSIE
Don't you ... I mean, do you still

love me?

Gregory thinks about this - looking inside himself with a

scientist

curiosity.

GREGORY
Wow.

JESSIE
Wow what?

GREGORY
Right now ... in this moment ... T
don't know what I feel about you.
JESSIE
Well you don't have to sound so
enthusiastic!
GREGORY
It's not enthusiasm ... I just don't

know if I want this.

We can see a flash of panic on Jessie's face.

JESSIE
Oh. By that do you mean...this!- the
fact of this or ... the way this is?
GREGORY
(confused)
What?
JESSIE

Maybe you're tired of us in hotel
rooms. Maybe now that you've been
married you've grown accustomed to
something else and maybe you don't
want what we have unless it can be
within that same ... uh ... thing.

GREGORY
What are you saying?

JESSIE
Maybe we should get married.
(Gregory is shocked)
You said it's over between you and
Rose. I can get a divorce within a
month. Lets get married.

There is true desperation on her face. She is speaking the
truth. Gregory looks at her with compassion.

JESSIE (Cont'd)
We've loved each other for over
twenty years. Think of what we could
have had ... Think of what we still
can have.

GREGORY
Wow.

JESSIE
WOW WHAT NOW!?

GREGORY

I've been in love with you
practically all my life. I..I

a problem)
thought - that's what love feels like
..- All that longing ... Never
feeling entirely ... whole . .. But
I wonder.

JESSIE
WONDER WHAT! ?

Gregory suddenly looks scared.

GREGORY
I don't know. I don't know ... I have
to go.

He gets up and starts to dress. Jessie is in shock. She can
hardly form the words;

JESSIE
So ... what ... 50... are you ...
what are you saying here? You don't
want to marry me?

GREGORY
(dressing)
I don't know. No. I guess.

JESSIE

What are you saying to me? You can't

can't just leave! What does ...

You're ... you're not going to be ...

Jumping out of bed, Jessie pushes him away;

JESSIE
EEWW! GET AWAY FROM ME. OH GOD! I
feel like I'm going crazy! You're
talking to me like I'm some ... some
pathetic lonely ... homely person
with a nice personality! Like I'm
some woman who wants you but you
don't want me! How can that be after
all these years? What, have you been
lying all this time - asking me to
marry you? To trap me? Is that it?
Has this been some twenty year
conspiracy to get even!? Some long
convoluted plot to make me feel like
shit? Is there some hidden camera
around here!? What the hell is going
on here? This isn't who we are
together? THIS ISN'T WHO I AM IN THIS!

GREGORY
I'm so sorry.

JESSIE
Get out of here. GET OUT! NOW!

She turns and exits into the bathroom slamming the door.
Gregory watches all of this genuine affection...and a little
sadness. Jessie will be fine with her drama. And it really is
over - after all these years.

ROSE
You're drunk.

ALEX
I'm not. The coffee and the vomiting
really sobered me up.

ROSE
I'm thrilled for you but that doesn't
exactly put me in the mood to sleep

with you.
ALEX
Did you know how jealous Claire was
of you?
ROSE
What?
ALEX

She'd get so angry when I'd talk

how funny you were, what a great cook
you were. She thought I had a secret
crush on you. Maybe she was right.

ROSE
What are Goddesses? Like Innana, they
can be Queens of Heaven ~ holy,
sacred - but even she had to descend
into the underworld to become
complete. After confronting her
sister Erishkegal, Queen of the
Underworld, Innana acquired
"Erishkegal's eyes" ~ the ability to
see with a ruthlessness for truth all
that a woman is - loving, jealous,
timid, ambitious, beautiful and
horrifying - and rid herself of the
fantasies of heaven to live
authentically and freely.

At that moment, Doris enters with a gigantic arrangement ‘of

flowers. Everyone is impressed. Doris places them on the
desk.

ROSE (Cont'd)
Who died?

She reads the card from Alex - "I'M FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO

HENRY
I was wondering if you might have a
number where I can reach Rose Larkin.
It's an emergency.

DORIS
Why don't you just ask her?

Henry confidentially pulls her off to an isolated area.

HENRY
It's not for me, it's for her husband
Gregory. He was afraid she might not
want to speak to him so he wanted me
to ask you. He's on his way home
from Europe, you see.

DORIS

Yeah, I see. You must be "the friend"
I've heard about! The one who goes
five times with girls young enough to
be your daughters.

(Henry is shocked)
Now you listen to me. Rose is feeling
really good about herself right now
and I don't want anything getting in
the way of that - you hear me!? She's
seeing someone else right now -
someone she knew before Mr. Larkin
and she's very excited. She's living
with me and I don't give my phone
number out so just tell your friend
he doesn't have to rush home.

HENRY
(impressed)
Would you give your phone number to
me if I promised to keep it for
myself?

DORIS
I don't know. Five times may be
enough for a twenty year old - but
you're gonna have to do better than
that with me, pal.

I asked for some Dijon. I can't start

Rose pauses at his choice of metaphors.

I mean, I was so unhappy but T

now, I have nothing but choices.

ROSE
That's great. Where's the damn Dijon?

Alex reaches across the table and takes her hand.
ALEX
Wouldn't it be wierd, if after all

REALITY -

hesitates. Just when one fantasy has come true, another one
has taken it placé. She decides to tell him the truth.

ROSE
Alex, you're a great guy. But you're
not my type.

ALEX
What? ... But ... but I thought ...

I mena, I kind of felt that all this
time you felt ...

Rose looks at him with a surprised expression.

What? That I had a crush on you?

Maybe that was just a fantasy of
yours. I'm very flattered, sweetie.

The Waiter arrives with the Dijon.

Finally! Thank you.

Alex is perplexed. Suddenly, from outside the main dining
