2. EXT CITY STREETS DAY VIDEO

L.S., People on city streets. Shot from the interior of a moving
car, we see in black and white people walking on a Center City
street in Philadelphia. Heard are the voices of two women,
CHERYL DUNYE and TAMARA EVANS, as they drive to videotape a
wedding reception in Swarthmore, a Philadelphia suburb. This
driving pan is shot poetically (slow motion) and we notice the
change from black to white people, more parks, and bigger houses
as the landscape changes from urban to suburban. The two women
are heard and never seen:

TAMARA
(V.0.)
So these are our peoples, huh?

CHERYL
What?

TAMARA
(V.0.) .
Our peoples. I'm tapirg our drive to the gig. Where is it again?

CHERYL

Somewhere in Swarthmore. Tamara, why .are you taping now?

TAMARA

some of this in the final tape of their wedding. You know some
cultural commentary stuff.

CHERYL

Girl, they don't want this in ‘their wedding video. It's a not a
documentary.

I bet she'll love seeing this.

Tamara is seen carrying a tripod while walking towards CAMERA:

CAMERA pans and follows Tamara to a table with wedding cake and
food. Tamara crams two hors d‘oeuvres in her mouth. She turns

Tamara walks towards camera making face:

TAMARA
Hey Cheryl, would you look at the nut in the back.

Camera focuses on back row revealing a’ JEWISH MAN with eyes
closed rubbing his yarmulke all over his head.

A BLACK MALE GUEST in the back row notices Cheryl's taping of
the Jewish man:

her head at the bride and groom. The Jewish side of the family
stands on one side and the Black family stands on the other.

How ‘bout you folks mixing families for this photo. It looks
like you are gathered for a lynching.

Everyone is silent and looks at CHERYL (Camera) angrily.

A FAT WHITE MAN, 40-years-old, walks right in front of the
camera. He appears to be the wedding photographer and carries
photography equipment. He is sweating: ce

FAT WHITE MAN
Looks great...but could you two men in the back switch places?

Cheryl walks from behind camera brushing against it causing the

Camera follows Cheryl as she walks to a table in front of a
mirror. On the table is a flashing answering machine. She
presses the play button, looks in the mirror and continues to
sing:

CHERYL
"...I'm ready to take all my chances with you..."

A voice is heard on the machine. It's a man, BOB, Cheryl's boss:

BOB's VOICE
Cheryl, this is Bob,... your boss.(pause) I was wondering if you
_ could work tonight. Jamal just quit...I mean just quit. (pause)
Anyway give a call if you can work. And if you see Tamara, tell

plantation style house is seen. We hear dramatic MUSIC as the
White Woman starts to cry. Running | towards her from the ~~
plantation house is a BLACK WOMAN in a tattered house slave' 8
dress with her hair tied in a bandanna. The Black Woman rushes
to the side of the White Woman and stands looking at her.

Cheryl is heard 0.8. sighing loudly over the dramatic MUSIC.

The Black Woman begins to cry and pulls a handkerchief from the
apron she wears and, ignoring her own tears, wipes the face of
the White Woman. The Black Woman then puts her arm around the
White Woman comforting her:

BLACK WOMAN
Don't ery none missy, Mr. Charles is coming back for sure. I
know he is.

Cheryl sighs loudly again.

Cheryl holds a video tape box from the film "Plantation
Memories."

CHERYL
The “Watermelon Woman” (pause). That's the only credit given to
her, the actress who played Elsie ..'Elsie’..(shakes
head)...isn't she the most beautiful black woman you've ever
seen?...I can't begin to find the words to describe how upset I
am about seeing her in this film...you should have seen the rest
of the movie, she was in a total of ten scenes or so and all she
did was whine and give service and make people laugh.... I can't
believe it... a woman so lovely made to be a maid. It's just not
right...that's why I'm sitting here talking about it ‘cause it's
so wrong. I guess what I'm really doing is making a video about
it...I mean her ...Elsie, the...Watermelon Woman.(pause; Cheryl
shows box to camera) I'm going to read you some of the film's
description as stated on the back of this box...(reads from box)
“Women Films (looks into camera), the distributor of this
collection...{looks back at box) is proud to present to you a
first in a series of films directed by women working in the
Golden Age of Hollywood. Director Martha Page, ..blah-blah-
blah... here... The supporting cast includes Mildred Mallory,
Bobby Bell and the Watermelon Woman. (pause, looking into
camera) “The Watermelon Woman,” is it her first and last name or
just first name...(pause) Why would a black woman play a mammie
and go by the name The Watermelon Woman?

Seen is a C.U. of TV which holds a frozen image of ELSIE-the

voice over:

So tonight, after screening this video, I’ve decided to find out
as much as I can about this beauty... I mean look at her. (pause)
) Something is really wrong if someone so fine gets remembered by
the name The Watermelon Woman. (pause)

There is something in her eyes that's calling to me...something
saying ‘look at me and know who I am.'(pause) She's the real
star here and what you are going to see is my movie about her
life.

All these women were remarkable in their ability to transcend
the stereotype in one way or another, through humor or song,
even gesture. 1930's Hollywood was a pretty rough Place for
black actresses to do anything interesting in film beyond
playing a black maid or servant. The competition was intense.
There were few roles and many promising men and women wanting to
play them. (pause) You know, Hollywood, at this time, employed
almost as many, if not more, black screen stars than it does
today.
