A WHITE SCREEN

Just a pale, milk white. A moment. And then MUSIC:
Haydn’s “Toy Symphony" -- a scratched, vintage recording.

TWO PAIRS OF SKATES glide into frame. And now we realize,
the white is ice.

START CREDITS AND PULL BACK TO FIND u
TWO SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN -- A BOY and GIRL. Hand in hand.
He wears a dinner jacket and glovas. She is pure confection,

white chiffon and lace. They are at once proud and nervous.
They bagin to skate.

There is nothing around them. No point of reference.

Just the two of them, the music, and the ice. They are in :
a world of their own. Perfect. Tentative. Pure. The joy ‘
of beginnings. For this next minute and a half they are the
most innocent, lovely creatures in the world.

END CREDITS AND DISSOLVE TO:

EXT, EST. SHOT OLYMPIC VILLAGE -~ DAY

Flags crack in the wind. Crowds choke the streets.

cUuT TO:

INT. CALGARY DORMITORY ROOM ~~ SAME TIME

DOUGLAS DORSEY is 22, a young man in the dead-bang prime of
life. poUG is tough, solid and gocd-locking in a coarse,
unkempt way. He is an athlete -- a great one ~- and he knows
it. He is also, at this very moment, in a complete frenzy,
pulling on socks, pants, and shirt like a wild man --

DOUG
It's one o'clock in the gaddamned
afternoon! Qne o‘clock! What the

hell happened to the goddamned alarm?

ACROSS THE ROOM ~- in bed, a GIRL peers sleepily from a
chaos of sheets.

GIRL
(a German accent)
You say nein.

DOUG
Yes! Nine!

GIRL
Yahi Nein! You say nein alarm.
Is mistake?
 

 

DOUG snags a large equipment bag -- hurdles effortlessly
over a half-dozen pairs of CROSS-COUNTRY SKIS -- blitzing
for the door --

GIRL
-- Sher dich zum teufel!

Forget about it. DOUG is gone.

cUuT TO:
INT. A SKATING RINK -- SAME TIME

A practice facility beside the Saddledome. OFFICIALS and
COACHES watch PAIRS FIGURE SKATERS, men and women, in warm-up
suits whipping around the ice.

KATHERINE MOSELEY

skating alone, picks up speed, rounding the far end of the
ice. KATE is 19. She is petite, but with the strength of a
thoroughbred. She is gorgeous, but it is a defiant beauty.
KATE heaves ints the grasp cf her partner, BRIAN NEUMAN, a
lanky, gay man of 21. THEY join hands, accelerate, and begin
to weave past SEVERAL OTHER PAIRS. —

ON THE SIDELINES

RICK TUTTLE, Kate’s coach, a tanned, square-jawed man cf
forty, stares coldly as his skaters pass.

KATE AND BRIAN

expressions tightening, as they accelerate. Something is
bothering KATE. She josties her hands, trying quickly to
adjust BRIAN’s grip as they head for center ice.

KATE
(whispering urgently)
Left hand under! -- Left!

They grapple — their grip still uncertain as BRIAN starts
te lift her from the ice, and then --

KATE
-- Stop!

BRIAN hesitates -~ KATE slips from his hands ~- off balance --
falling -- just recovering -- landing awkwardly -- stumbling
across the ice and nearly into the boards.

TUTTLE
(from the sidelines)

Thirty million people just called
the rest of their families in from
the kitchen to watch the replay.
 

 

KATE wheels around, furious. TUTTLE stares, disgusted.

TUTTLE
What do you think this is, Kate,
Junior Pairs, 1981?

KATE
Me? You’re standing there, you
just saw what happened, and you’re
blaming me?

OTHER COACHES and SKATERS turn. BRIAN, in the BG, stares
over. TUTTLE, in no mood for backtalk, wags a reproving
finger, beckoning her toward hin.

CUT To:
INT. DORMITORY STAIRWELL -- DAY

DOUG hurtling down the stairs, taking them three at a time,
flying blindly past other ATHLETES arriving and departing
from their events. DOUG charging through when --

WOMAN'S VOICE
-- Xou!

DOUG stops, turns --

A young, dark, attractive, ITALIAN GIRL, dressed in a high-
fashion snowsuit, stands on the landing. She steps forward,
glaring. This is an angry woman.

ITALIAN GIRL
(thick Italian accent)
Where you are? -~ Where you are last
night? Where you are while I am
waiting?

DOUG hesitates, afraid to turn his back on this woman.

ITALIAN GIRL
You know how long I am waiting?

DOUG
(easing away)
Tina, please, I --

ITALIAN GIRL
-- Tina?
(she’s ready to kill)
. My name is Gina!
cuT TO:
INT. PRACTICE RINK SIDELINES -- DAY

KATE and TUTTLE face to face in a quiet, tense conversation:

 
KATE
Rick, I’m telling you, he can’t do it.

TUTTLE
I’m saying this for the last time:
You start fighting for your landings
and let me worry about Brian.

KATE
I’m out there trying to launch a
triple toe loop off a grip that’s
like a wet sponge!

TUTTLE
The move stays in.

KATE
He’s giving me nothing to work with!

TUTTLE
You're the one who’s not committing!

' KATE
I‘m the one who takes the fall!

TUTTLE
You can’t fall if you don’t get your
butt in the air!

the path of -- .

AN ONCOMING PASSENGER VAN -- SCREECHES TO A STOP -- inches

SWEDISH GIRLS

CUT TO:
INT. PRACTICE RINK RUNWAY -- DAY

KATE throws her skates into a bag. JACK MOSELEY, her father.
a prosperous man of 50 in a business suit, stands there.

KATE
I’m just asking you to talk to hin,
Dad! Just get him to listen.
WD

If KATE’s looking for sympathy, she’s picked the wrong guy.

JACK
Honey, we’ve been through all this
before -- Rick knows what’s best.

KATE stands, muscles up her skate bag, starts away.

JACK
Where do you think you’re going?

KATE
(as she goes)
I’ll be in my cell.

cUT To
EXT. THE SADDLEDOME BACK ENTRANCE -~- DAY

THE SWEDISH VAN skids to a stop. THE GIRLS waving as DOUG
dives out, racing for the building, pulling credentials as
he goes. A CALGARY POLICE OFFICER stands guard.

DOUG .
(breathlessly) '
Doug Dorsey... U.S. Hockey team...

coP
(checking his tags)
Hell, son, they’re just about to
start --

DOUG blows past the COP -- through the door and --

. CUT TO:
INT. THE BOWELS OF THE SADDLEDOME

An empty passageway. DOUG is lost. Sweating. Cursing.
Charging blindly ahead. From above, the MUFFLED ROAR OF THE
CROWD. If he could claw his way up to the ice he’d do it.

CUT TO:
A. DIFFERENT PASSAGEWAY

KATE striding ahead -- rounding a corner and -- SHACK! --
right into DOUG -- a head-on collision and it’s no contest
-- KATE sent flying on her ass --.

DOUG
(barely stopping)
-- Does this go up to the ice?

KATE stares at him, incredulous. "THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER"
begins to play in the distance.

DOUG

Is_this the way to the ice?

 
(@

'o)

KATE
(still sitting there)
Why you barbarian jerk -- is that
all you have to say?

Screw this, DOUG is already several steps away and moving.

KATE
Where were you raised, in a barnyard?

DOUG stops mid-stride. This kind of shit demands at least
a moment of his time.

DOUG
Honey, where I’m from we stand for
the National Anthen.

Now he’s gone.

cUuT TO:
INT. SADDLEDOME NETWORK BOOTH

TWO ANNOUNCERS, BUD and GORDON, talk to the camera:

BUD
If you’re just joining us from
the Men’s downhill, you’re in for
a big surprise. The Hungarian
Hockey team was supposed to be an
easy first round mark for the U.S.

GORDON
We’re in the third period and
Hungary is up by a goal...

CUT TO:
THE PENALTY BOX -- LIVE ACTION

DOUG, flushed and focused, is impatiently counting down the
final seconds of his incarceration. Five...four...three...

GORDON (OVER)
Here comes Dorsey out of the penalty
box. The power play is over.
DOUG explodes ONTO THE ICE -- as A WHISTLE BLOWS.

BUD (OVER)
-- And that’1ll be icing.

A pause in the action. The REFEREE grabs the puck.
BUD (OVER)

Doug Dorsey, of course, the phenom
from Mahorn, Minnesota.
 

OO)

GORDON (QVER)
Just a super story, Bud. Here’s a
Junior from the University of
Minnesota we’1ll definitely be seeing
in the NHL before the year is out.

Substitutions are being made. The U.S. COACH motions for
DOUG who waves him off. He’s staying on the ice.

BUD (OVER)
Incredible young athlete. Handles
the puck well. Sees everything --

GORDON
And what a skater -- as graceful as
anyone you’ll ever see on the ice.

THE HUNGARIAN COACH paces behind the PLAYERS BENCH. He stops,
leans down and whispers something to a huge, hulking GOON.
The GOON smiles toothlessly and jumps out onto the ice.

BUD (OVER)
This is a very intense, competitive
young man.

GORDON (OVER)
He learns to control that temper and
he could be one of the true greats of
the game.

ON THE ICE -- DOUG clustered with the OTHER PLAYERS for a
face-off. The GOON nudges in beside him. DOUG jostles
back -- THEY’RE starting to get rough as --

THE REFEREE drops the puck -=- and they’re off --

The puck trailing to the far side of the ice -- action there,
as DOUG circles, waiting for a breakaway --

The puck skitters behind the U.S. net -- a pass to -- DOUG
who takes it on the move and --

TWO HUNGARIAN FORWARDS charging as DOUG drops his shoulder

-- fakes a pass -- does an amazing fuli-turn spin that
sends the TWO HUNGARIAN FORWARDS crashing into each other.

BUD (QVER)
There goes Dorsey! -- What a move!

DOUG, all alone, flying across center ice as an HUNGARIAN
DEFENSEMAN rushes to cut the angle -- DOUG stops cold --
the DEFENSEMAN falls past him, into the boards --

DOUG takes off -- blitzing for the goal --

 
 

NL

The HUNGARIAN GOALIE braces as --

One of the HUNGARIAN FORWARDS lunges -~- his stick flying free
and into DOUG’s skates and --

DOUG begins to fall -- off balance -- going down -- still
managing somehow to shoot and --

THE PUCK lifts -=- just above the GOALIE’S GLOVE and --
DoUG into the boards -- hard -- THE CROWD CHEERING and --

Out of nowhere -- THE GOON lumbering at full speed ~-- this
is a man with a mission and --

DOUG, starts to his feet when -- WHAM! -- THE GOON, stick held
high -- ploughs into him -- a wicked, crushing blow and --

FINALLY TO -~ DOUG’S HELMET

skittering across the ice, past other PLAYERS and REFEREES,
in whose horrified expressions, we measure the seriousness
of the blow.

cuT TO:
EXT. CALGARY -- NIGHT

Lights dancing over busy streets outside the Saddledone.

cUuT TO:
INT. THE SADDLEDOME

Packed house. Figure skating competition. Aaron Copeland’s
"RODEO" blasting through the house.

ON THE ICE -~- KATE AND BRIAN in the midst of their program.
Coming out of a death spiral and striding together the length
of the ice -- arm movement, filler stuff, catching their
breath as they race toward their finale --

. SKATE-CAM CLOSE-UP

We’re really tight here -- Just the two of them, smiles
Plastered on their faces, sweat bleeding through make-up --
the elegance of the sport revealed as the hard work it really
is. MUSIC PEAKING -- faster and --

KATE
(under her breath)
. Pick it up! -- Pick it up!

BRIAN’s expression tightening -- KATE’s hands searching for
a better grip but there’s not time -- THEY’RE INTO THE LIFT
-- BRIAN clenches -- KATE is up -- BRIAN falters -- too late
-- she’s launched -- into the air -- spinning -- around and
around but -- trouble -- she’s underrotated -- off balance --

coming down -- her toe snags -- and BRIAN watches in horror
-- KATE is falling as THE MUSIC CRASHES ITS FINAL CRESCENDO
and she goes sprawling across the ice --

CUT TO:
NETWORK FEED == FULL FRAME

BRIAN alone at center ice. KATE, on her ass, yards away.
The CROWD silent, as she rises slowly. TWO ANNOUNCERS --
DICK and PEGGY -- solemnly break in over the picture:

. DICK (QVER)
Oh dear...
PEGGY (OVER)
...Such a difficult move...
DICK - (OVER)

+.-Just a heartbreaking moment, and
to have it happen here...

KATE stands to SYMPATHETIC APPLAUSE. She looks ashen.

PEGGY (OVER)
It takes so much extraordinary work,
and time and effort to get this far
and to have it end like this...

BRIAN rushes to KATE’s side, reaches for her hand. She yanks
it away and starts skating off the ice, leaving him behind.

DICK (OVER) .
Kate Moseley -- My God, this just
isn’t done -- She’s...she’s leaving
the ice...

BACK TO:
LIVE ACTION -=- THE RUNWAY

CHOKED WITH PEOPLE -- the crowd parting -- ALL EYES ON --

KATE fleeing the ice -- striding as fast as she can on
skate guards, through the crowd and --

TUTTLE in the BG, disgusted watching her go, as BRIAN skates
in alone from the ice and --

JACK, off to one side, shaking his head, making no move to
comfort his daughter as she passes and --

KATE still coming -- FACES EVERYWHERE -- and WE’RE TRACKING
WITH HER -- HAND-HELD TENSION as she stares straight ahead,
a stoic mask of an expression frozen on her face barely
disguising the pain and fear and humiliation in her eyes --
the crowd, the moment, the cameras, nothing but a blur as
she ploughs ahead and --

INTO THE CORRIDOR == KATE still coming -- OTHER SKATERS

she starts to run and her expression begins to fall apart

DISSOLVE To:
EXT. CHICAGO’S MT. SINAI EYE AND EAR -~- DAY

EST. SHOT -- Doctors, patients, nurses hustling in and out.

CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

A private room. Dead flowers and stacks of magazines
evidence a long stay. DOUG, in jeans and T-shirt, stands
at the mirror examining a shaved SCAR above his right ear.
He takes a deep breath, steels himself, and exits the room.

CUT TO:
INT. DOCTOR‘S OFFICE -- DAY.

DOUG sits nervously as his DOCTOR flips through a chart on
his desk. The DOCTOR looks up, finds a smile.

DOCTOR
I hear you’ve made quite an
impression on our nursing staff:

A moment. DOUG says nothing, far too tense for small talk.
The DOCTOR shifts, summons his best professional resolve.

DOCTOR
I wish I had better news. It could
be worse. Luckily, we got in fast
enough to limit some of the damage.

The DOCTOR glances at the chart.

DOCTOR

For the record, you've lost close to
eighteen degrees of peripheral vision
in your right eye.

(he hesitates)
In most cases, something like this
would be an inconvenience, but for
a hockey player, well --

DOUG’
So how long before it comes back?

DOCTOR
Different states have different
driving regulations. Here in
Illinois, your car would have to be
equiped with a full-view mirror --
DOUG
~~ How long before it comes back? °

DOCTOR
Doug, I’m sorry, but you’ve got
a blindside. It’s a permanent
condition.

 

pouc
So there’s an operation, right?

DOCTOR
I’m afraid not.

DOUG
There is an operation! It’s just
you hate to mention it because it’s
so outrageously overpriced.

DOCTOR
It’s not a question of money.

DOUG
It’s dangerous, right? You open
the brain -- some micro~laser thing
-- you mess around, who knows what
could happen --

‘@ . : DOCTOR
: Doug, I’ve specialized in opthalmic
surgery for for over thirty years --
_ DOUG

Okay! So you don’t do it here!
But somebody does it -- someplace,
there’s a clinic, you’ve got to go
to Mexico City and they inject
shark piss up your nose and you’ve
got to sit absolutely still for
eight months and there’s a two
percent survival rate and you hate
to even mention it because it’s the
kind of quack medicine you’ve spent
your life fighting, but right now,
because you see just how absolutely
desperate I am you’re gonna break
your solemn oath and tell me, right?

(pleading)

DOCTOR
I’m very sorry, Doug...
DOUG sags. Blinking back tears. Just sitting there.

EXT. THE DULUTH LOCKS -- MINNESOTA -- AUTUMN -- DAY

Gray skies. Cold air. Frigid spray blows off Lake Superior.
DOUG, workclothes covered with grease, winches down a miter
gate. SUPERIMPOSE: -

TWO_ YEARS LATER
DOUG stands and stares grimly out over the canal as a barge
passes in the BG.

CUT TO:
EXT. A ROADSIDE BAR -- MAHORN MINNESOTA -- DAY

A cinderblock gin mill in the middle of nowhere. A few cars
parked out front. A rusted double-wide trailer sits out back.
A tin sign advertises:

"DORSEY’S PENALTY BOX -- TAP AND GRILL"

A pitted ‘68 Chevy pulls up. DOUG gets out, heads for the
door, as his ride pulls away.

CUT TO:
INT. DORSEY’S TAP AND GRILL -- DAY

A warm bar in a cold place. Hockey stuff everywhere:
posters, sticks, pennants up all over. A COUPLE DRUNKS
hunched over shots at the end of the rail.

WALTER DORSEY, Doug’s older brother, a big, beefy guy in
his thirties stands behind the bar, lost in a newspaper.

- " pOUG’S VOICE
Any mail?

WALT looks up to see DOUG heading his way.

WALT
Hey... You’re early.

DOUG
(arriving at the bar)
Ate in the car. Any mail?

WALT
{ignoring the question)
Propane stopped by. I had him leave
three tanks for the trailer.

DOUG
Something came, didn’t it?
(Walt hesitates)
You opened it, right? -- How many
times do I have to tell you --
 

13

WALT
-- Hesh opened it.
(down the bar)
Tell him, Hesh!

DOUG turns, angrily. HESH, a skinny, old drunk hunches down.

DOUG
It’s bad enough my brother thinks
he can go through my goddamned --

WALT
-- Hey, Doug.
(Doug turns)
We were all just hoping for good news.

DOUG
(instantly deflated)
Read it.

WALT
Dougie, come on...

. DOUG
Read it, Walter.

WALT reluctantly pulls the letter from his pocket, reads:

WALT
"We regret to inform you that
at this time, our hockey program
is not offering try-outs to
unrecruited players."

DOUG takes the blow. Looks around.

WALT
You want a beer? Have a beer.

DOUG
No. I/11 catch you later.
(starting away)
Sorry, Hesh.

Silence. Long faces listening, as.DOUG SLAMS OUT THE DOOR.

cuT To:
EXT. A POND -- TWILIGHT

A pick-up HOCKEY GAME in progress. DOUG the oldest player
by far. These KIDS may be young, but they’re good. DOUG

moving the puck up the ice, looking like a giant out there
-- blowing past EVERYONE -- slowing to shoot when --

PEE WEE -- the smallest kid on the ice -- slips in on his
blindside -- stripping the puck off DOUG’S stick --

 
DOUG turns -- too late -- BEE WEE stoking away with the
puck. DOUG left standing there, looking whipped.

CUT TO:
INT. AN INDOOR TRAINING RINK -- NIGHT

Domed roof. Regulation ice. State of the art. Dramatic
contrast to the pond. A BRAHMS CONCERTO fills the space.

ON THE ICE -- KATE and a NEW PARTNER skating -- an arabesque
-- into a side-by-side sit spin -- KATE looking perfect, her
NEW PARTNER, however, loses his edge and falls --

KATE
(stopping cold)
Oh come on...!

The MUSIC STOPS. PARTNER stares over like a beaten dog.

PARTNER
Sorry, Kate, I’ll get it.
(to someone off ice)
Can we try it again?

ANTON PAMCHENKO -- Kate’s current coach, starts out onto the
ice. ANTON is a man who has come a long way through difficult
times. A quiet reserve. Eyes always probing. An abrasive
exterior belies a warm, knowing soul.

' ANTON
(a thick Russian accent)
We are in one piece?

” KATE
‘This guy is taking us nowhere.

ANTON
Katya, please...

PARTNER
I can’t concentrate like this!
(pleading)
Every move -- every day -- she’s
turning me into a nervous wreck!

KATE, unmoved, is already on her way off the ice.
KATE
I’ve got laundry that can skate
better than that.

CUT TO:
INT. THE DOME -- NIGHT

OFF THE ICE -- ANTON and JACK MOSELEY in conversation.
In the BG, KATE on the ice. Skating alone. Working hard.
ANTON
You should’ve been making her
singles skater.

JACK
You’re sure it’s too late?

ANTON shoots him a look that says it’s much too late.

JACK
So where do we go from here?

ANTON
Two years, eight partners. This
one is too small. That one too big.
Too loud. Too much sweat. Not
enough sweat --

JACK
So dig a little deeper.

ANTON
We hit bottom rock, Mr. Moseley.
Let me tell you how is: I go to
rink. I see skater. If I like
-- if I see even spark of hope,
I talk. Of course, skater says
to me finally, "Who is partner?"

(he shakes his head) .
Reputation is like plague.

{Jack stiffens) :
Please...she is tremendous skater.
Everyone is saying this. Petite.
Powerful. But then always is
coming the big "B"...

(an American accent)
“Whatta bitch."

JACK
(bristling)
What about Spindler? Kate said you
spoke to him, that he was on the
fence.

ANTON
I spare feelings. Spindler says
before he skates with her he wears
garlic from neck and sleeps with cross.

JACK
(stone cold)
There’s a month left on your
contract. Find someone who can
cut it or get off the payroll.

INT. ANTON’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Spartan. The room of a refugee. A PHOTOGRAPH of ANTON as
a much younger man on skates. A SILENT TV plays in the BG.

_ ANTON (OVER)
+.-but difficulties are in past.
Is mature young woman now --

' THE CAMERA FINDS ANTON -=- on the phone, a week-long growth

of beard evidences some busy days. As he listens to what is
apparently unpleasant news, he reachs down to pour himselé a
SHOT OF VODKA from a bottle on the nightstand.

ANTON
(into the phone)
.«.-Of course...Yes, I understand,
thank you, anyway.

He hangs up. Downs the shot. He glances at the TV, before
picking up the remote control and CLICKING THE VOLUME UP --

INSERT -- THE TV -- A HOCKEY GAME IN PROGRESS

ANTON watches -- expressionless for a moment. And then his
eyes come alive. He leans in. Thinking. >

CUT TO:
EXT. DOUG’S POND -- NIGHT

Cheap floodlights strung from makeshift plywood posts cas

an uneven glare on a small section of the ice. Steel druss
are spaced every few yards -- an obstacle course. DOUG,
hockey stick in hand, speeds across the ice -- in the amidst
of a grueling kamikaze drill -- slaloming in and out of tne
barrels -- backward -- forward -- an amazing display of
skating ability. Pouring sweat, heaving for breath, he st=srps.
He wipes his brow, then suddenly turns, hearing something --
ANTON at the edge of the pond applauding. He stops.

ANTON :
Ice is safe? Sign has warning.

DOUG
So don’t skate.

ANTON shrugs, starts walking out.

ANTON .
You skate very strong. Beautiful
line. Much power. Weight transfer
is perfection.
(he smiles)
I see many tapes.

DOUG, winded, watches him approach suspiciously.
aes

DOUG
Look, pal, if you’re a reporter,
you’re a little late. The story’s
been done.

ANTON
I am wondering if you are this
strong in upper body?

DOUG

What’re you, some kind of twinkie?
ANTON,

I am coach.
DOUG

You're kidding...

(an instant, total

transformation)
Look, hey, I’m sorry -- Are you the
guy from B.U.? -= You are, right?
The Swedish guy, right?

(before he can answer)

Ww. !

(standing tall)
Upper body? -- I’m a rock. I’m in
the best shape of my life -- I’m
benching three-hundred. Weight
training, roadwork, speed drills --

(shifting gears)
~- Hey, I know I had a rep -- I mean,
who’re we fooling right? The girls,
the partying, the goofing off -- it
was a problem, no question --

ANTON
-- I am not hockey coach.

DOUG
Huh...?

ANTON opens a gym bag hanging off his shoulder, begins
fishing out something that WE CAN’T SEE.

ANTON
You wear size eleven, yes?

DOUG
What the hell is this?

ANTON
Maybe nothing. You try.

DOUG
(looking down)
Those are figure skates, pal.

On that -- a SUDDEN HUGE SNAPPING SOUND -- DOUG looks down.
BETWEEN HIS LEGS -- a jagged faultline -- the ice has cracked.

CUT TO:
EXT. THE LIMOUSINE -- DAY
Easing up a country lane. -Stopping at a large iron gate,
bordered by a daunting, high stone wall. THE GATE swings
open and THE LIMO pulls up a winding estate driveway.

INSIDE THE LIMO

DOUG, lost in the expanse of this huge backseat lounge,
stares out the window at the incredible passing scenery.

DOUG
Holy shit...

Up ahead, a sprawling, two-story, TUDOR STONE COTTAGE.
DRIVER
(veddy British)
That sir, is the pool house.

DOUG sits back. Blown away.
THE MOSELEY ESTATE
is world class. THE LIMO PASSES -- tennis courts, olympic
pool, a fifteen car garage and finally around a circular
driveway, stopping in front of -- A huge STONE MANSION.
DOUG exits the limo, looking around, dumbfounded.

ON THE MANSION STEPS -- ANTON stares down, watching DOUG’s
reaction. .

ANTON and DOUG walking along when DOUG suddenly stops --

DOUG

cuT TO:
INT. THE DOME -- DAY

ANTON and DOUG enter. A TCHAIKOVSKY SYMPHONY blaring.

ON THE ICE -- KATE, in white tights and skirt, skates alone
to the MUSIC. She makes no sign of recognition, but knows
full-well she’s being watched. Twirling and preening --
she’s putting on a real show.

DOUG takes a good look. He smiles. He likes what he sees.
ANTON moves to the sound system -- KILLS THE MUSIC.

ANTON
Come...

ANTON and DOUG head down the RUNWAY and start walking toward
center ice. The closer they get, the bigger DOUG’s smile.

KATE turns, feigns surprise -- and then her expression sours.

KATE
That’s not Spindler!

‘ ANTON shrugs. Guilty as charged.

KATE
Where the hell is Spindler?
You said --

ANTON
-- You said Spindler. This is Dorsey.
Douglas Dorsey. :
She examines DOUG as if he were an insect.

KATE
Dorsey? Never head of hin.

* ANTON
Douglas is beautiful skater.

‘KATE steps back, a look of mounting horror forming --

KATE
You’re...you’re that hockey player.

DOUG’s smile fades.

. ANTON
Is try-out.

DOUG
Nice to-meet you.

He offers his hand. She stares at it with epic distaste.
20

ANTON
I said, is try-out.

Reluctantly, KATE moves to shake -- one touch and --

KATE
(recoiling instantly)
-- ny God!
DOUG

- What? -- My hands?

KATE
What do you do, soak them in
battery acid?

DOUG
Look, I’m sorry...I guess they’re
a little rough, but hey...
(he tries a smile)
I’ve never had any complaints -before.

KATE

I’m terribly impressed.
(turning on Anton}
What is this, the final stages of
Ukranian alcohol psychosis?

DOUG
(to Anton)
Wait a minute -- who’s checking
out who here?

KATE
(wheeling on Doug)
I don’t know how many slapshots
you’ve taken to the brain, but this
was your audition, and let me assure
you, it’s over.

They’re off and running. ANTON can only stare back and forth.

DOUG
Yo! -- Snow White, put a clamp on it.
I’m here scoping you out. I told
this guy from minute-one that the
idea of strapping on pink skates and
throwing some teeny~bopper rink-rat
around the ice was not my idea of a
happening experience!

KATE
(to Anton)
Get him out of my building.

DOUG
(to Anton)
Temperamental? Lemme tell you,
I got another word for it.

KATE
(to Anton)
Is that what you told him?

DOUG
What -- like it’s a secret?

KATE
Who the hell do you think you are?

DOUG
I know exactly who I am -- I‘ma
guy who came a long way for lunch.

KATE
Well, don’t let me keep you from
the trough.

DOUG
(to Anton)
Sorry, buddy, I wouldn’t wish this
on a snake. I’m outta here.

DOUG starts away. KATE heading the opposite direction --

ANTON

Is end of line! Pairs means two!
You have no partner, you are skating

KATE stares at him, shocked, chastened.

DOUG
Look, man --

. ANTON
(cutting him off)

And what is for you? Back to

Siberia? Skating on pond is big

excitement? Hockey for you is over.

Kaput. Who else but me is being so

insane to take chance on you?

DOUG looks small all of a sudden. Silence.

ANTON
Good. We skate.

CUT TO:
BLACK SKATES across the ice to...WHITE SKATES.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- DOUG, wearing a Chicago Blackhawks
T-shirt and hockey sweats, standing behind KATE. Both of
them stone-faced. ANTON, on skates, circles DOUG, inspecting.

ANTON
Chest high...

As he directs, they respond and adjust.

ANTON

Rang, but there is life -- Now, left
hand around her waist.

DOUG hesitates. KATE braces. ANTON slides in -- pulls
DOUG’s hand into position. This is suddenly very intimate.

ANTON
Katya, shoulders relax...relax.

KATE, teeth clenched, lets her shoulders fall. ANTON places
DOUG’s right hand in hers. She flinches. ANTON skates back
a few yards, admiring the two of then. '

ANTON

Goed. Line is beautiful.

(as he circles)
I am counting a beat. On four you
will push off. Katya, you will lead.
Slowly -- a large eight. Douglas you
will push left with her left -- right
with right. She will show the way.
All will be smooth and easy...

(continuing as-~)
 

THEY'RE OFF -- a jerky, false start -- but DOUG hangs in
and -- stroke -- and stroke and -- AROUND THE ICE -- and
KATE’s not helping him any, but she doesn’t have to because
he’s picking this up fast ~- and by the time they make the
second turn he’s starting to synch --

ANTON .
Good! -- Heads up! -- Long strokes!

SKATE CAM CLOSE UP
DOUG AND KATE as they glide. She knows what she’s doing.

“He has to concentrate. Close quarters.

What do you do, shower once a week?

DOUG -
That an invitation?

KATE accelerates. DOUG almost slips.

ANTON
(calling over)
Enough! Center ice, please.
First position.

They stop. Skate back beside ANTON, who quickly arranges
them as they were in the beginning -- DOUG behind KATE.
* ANTON
Katya, lock arms please.

KATE complies, elbows angled at her sides.

ANTON
Douglas, please to pick her up.
DOUG looks at him. -He’s serious. DOUG puts his hands
beneath KATE’s elbows and lifts her effortlessly.
ANTON
Enough. We are finished.
KATE
I told you this was ridiculous.
(still up there)
Will you please put me down!
DOUG lets go -= KATE drops like a stone, flat on her ass.

DOUG
Guess that move needs some work.

KATE
You_psychopath!

DOUG pushes off, skating for the runway.

DOUG
It’s been a gas working with you.
Good luck with the next victim.

ANTON
We start tomorrow morning at eight.

DOUG AND KATE

A two-story outbuilding down the lawn from the Mansion.
Two apartments, one on either floor.

Pleasant. Comfortably furnished. Currently vacant.
DOUG looking around. ANTON behind hin.

ANTON
Free room and board. Expenses.
Allowance. We are working seven
days a week without break. You eat,
breathe, and sleep pairs skating.

DOUG .
Look, it was great getting out of
town, but I yot work tomorrow.

ANTON .
You train with me, I promise you
are making wonderful living on
skates the rest of your life.

- DOUG
Let’s not screw around. I can’t
do this and you know it.

ANTON
I don’t play games. Is too late.

DOUG
You know what I do when I see
figure skating? It’s a three
choice situation: either I leave
the rink, change the channel, or
laugh my ass off.

ANTON opens a closet beside a television and VCR, inside
are hundreds of SKATING VIDEOS.
ANTON
Then you will have much to amuse you.

CUT To:
EXT. MANSION GROUNDS -= NIGHT

A CORPORATE HELICOPTER HEAVES INTO FRAME, touching down
on a landing pad. JACK MOSELEY, business suit, briefcase

INT. THE MANSION FRONT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

JACK hands his coat to an OLD BUTLER as KATE rips into him.
KATE

-~- I'd like to know how much you
had to do with this!

JACK
Honey, the bottom line is: Can he
skate?

KATE

You knew he was coming and you
never said a word!

JACK
(dismissing the Butler)
Thank you, Martin.

KATE and JACK stand there a moment as the BUTLER departs.

JACK

(all business now)
If you’re telling me this guy
can’t skate, if you’re saying that
Anton’s gone round the bend and
that you’re sure -- absolutely
sure -- this is a waste of time,
then that’s one thing. But if
you’re quitting on me, Kate, if
this is your way of telling me
you've lost your stomach for it,
then we better sit down and talk.

KATE stands there, looking lost. Very much undecided.

JACK
Good. You had me worried there.

JACK brushes a strand of hair from her shoulder.

JACK

/ I’ll take a look at hin.
26
INT. MANSION STUDY ~- NIGHT

The room is oak-panelled, but it’s hard to notice because
every square inch is covered with TROPHIES, MEDALS, and
PHOTOS OF KATE SKATING SINCE SHE WAS FOUR. JACK sits behind
his desk. DOUG, across from him, is slouched in an armchair.

JACK
Let me tell you how I run my
business: I hire the very best
people I can get my hands on and
I leave them alone until they
disappoint me or I can find somebody
better. You’ve heard of the Moscow
Central Army Sports Club?
(Doug nods)
Anton was their pride and joy.
When it comes to skating I don’t
think there’s anybody who knows
more. So I trust him. I have to.
He says you’re something special.
He tells me he can work around
your eye problen.
. (beat)
What do you think?

. DOUG
I think you must be in pretty sad
shape to come after me.

JACK sits back. Off balance and not used to it.

DOUG
So who else is in on this?

JACK
What do you mean by that?

DOUG
When you’re done, do I have to go
talk to mom and the rest of the
family?

JACK
(flatly)
Kate is an only child. Her mother
died when she was six.

JACK lets him hang there a moment.

DOUG
Sorry. It’s been a long day.

JACK
You stay with us and you’ll have
a lot of long days.
Ne

A beat. JACK measures DOUG.

JACK points to

JACK
I understand you and I have one
thing in common.

DOUG
What’s that?

JACK
I don't like to lose either.

AN EMPTY GLASS DISPLAY CASE on his desk.

JACK

You see this? -- There’s an Olympic
Gold medal belongs in there. We’re
winners in this house. We’ve always
been winners. Kate is a winner.

(his eyes linger on

the empty case)
And this damn thing...this is our
veminder of what happens when you
hitch your wagon to a dud.

(he looks up)
See, Doug, pairs skating, more than
anything else, is about trust. You
trust that I’m gonna throw you high
enough in the air, and I trust that
when you come down, you’re not gonna
put a blade in my back. I can never
skate any better than you let me.

DOUG stares back, stone-faced. A cipher.

JACK
Now Brian Newman could skate. And
unlike you, he wasn’t a reclamation
project. But you couldn’t trust
him. He wasn’t what I’d call a
pressure player. When the whip came
down, Brian folded and Kate ended
up looking like a fool.

JACK lifts a stack of papers on his desk for DOUG to see.

JACK balls the

JACK

focuses on Doug)
Are you a pressure player, Doug?
Or is everyone wasting their time?

Without a word, DOUG, leans forward, takes the next page
on the stack, crushes it quickly in his hand and flips it
effortlessly toward the garbage can --

THE PAPER arcs far across the room -- BING! Dead perfect.

JACK
Lucky shot.

DOUG
I say I make it again.
(he grins)
Double or nothing my allowance.

JACK smiles, pushes the stack toward him.

JACK 7
You’re on.

. CUT TO:
INT. DOORS OUTSIDE THE STUDY

KATE at the keyhole -- a baffling silence. Suddenly, THE
DOORS FLY OPEN -- JACK and DOUG exit the study, all smiles.

JACK

Doug’s shoulder)
Great to have you aboard, son!
(looking up)
Kate, there you are...

KATE stares in horror at this tableau of fraternity.

Great meeting you, Jack...

smiles broadly)

INT. THE BUTLER’S BEDROOM

Dark. Proper. MARTIN, the eldery butler, reading in bed,
hears something -- looks up over bifocals.

MARTIN
Well...

KATE, wearing a nightgown, steps into the room, closing the
door furtively behind her. Silence. She stands there.

MARTIN
It’s been a while, hasn’t it?

KATE nods. Something needy in her expression.

/ MARTIN
That bad?
(she nods again)
I’m an old man, Kate.
(she shrugs)
We'll be very tired in the morning.

KATE
I won’t tell if you won’t.

MARTIN cuts the thinnest of smiles. KATE brightens.

WIPE TO:
MARTIN’S ROOM -- TWO HOURS LATER

KATE and MARTIN sprawled on a couch, chastely bundled in
nightclothes and blankets -= watching TV -~- popcorn, cookies,
potato chips, strewn everywhere. KATE is weeping. MARTIN,
huddled in robe and nightcap, looks pretty choked-up himself.

ACROSS THE ROOM -- ON TV -- A VIDEOTAPE runs the final,
tear-stained moments of "Dark Victory."

DISSOLVE To:
INT. (THE DOME -- EARLY MORNING

DOUG at center ice, staring straight ahead. ANTON, carrying
a dozen plastic cones, stands with KATE off to one side.

As this scene plays, ANTON, testing the perimeters of DOUG’s
visual problem, moves KATE around the ice.

ANTON
We start here -- you are seeing her?

DOUG
Nope.

ANTON drops a cone, pulls KATE forward to the next position.
DOUG
(calling over)
If you’re so good, why didn’t you
just skate solo?
(silence, he turns--) ©

ANTON
Eyes forward!
(Doug turns back)
You are seeing here?

DOUG shakes his head no. ANTON drops a cone. They move on.

DOUG
It’s a reasonable question.

ANTON
Tell him.

__ KATE
(grudgingly)
I wouldn’t. do the compulsories.

DOUG
You mean, those figure eights and
stuff? Wouldn’t or couldn’t?

KATE
I detested the entire procedure.

ANTON
(stopping)
Compulsories require patience.
(Kate shoots him
a look)
What about here?:

DOUG
Got it.

ANTON drops two cones, checking the angles. KATE breaks free.

. KATE
Talk about hiring the handicapped.

DOUG
Hey, if we’re gonna work together,
you might try and be polite.

KATE
You’re not going to be here long ~
enough to make it worth the effort.

DOUG
Don’t think I/11 be able to put up
with your shit?
KATE
(as she passes)
I don’t think you can skate.

DOUG
There’s only two things I do really
well and skating’s one of them.

KATE
Grunting around the ice with a
stick in your hand is not skating.

DOUG
Honey, when it comes to hockey,
you haven’t, got a clue.
(beat)
Aren’t you going to ask me what
the second thing is?

KATE
God, you really are a neanderthal.

DOUG
Sorry to disappoint you, but I’m
from Minnesota.

KATE stares over, incredulous. DOUG smiles -- he's joking.

DOUG
What do you do for fun? Polish
your knife collection?

KATE
I’m sure there’s nothing I do that
you’d find exciting. I don’t open
beer bottles with my toes. I don’t
sit around and count what’s left
of my teeth. I don’t even enjoy
watching a good tractor-pull. It’s
a very limited existence, but I’ve
gotten used to it.

DOUG
Life of the party, huh?
(he starts to stretch)
Place must be crawling with guys.
KATE
(biting at this)
For your information, I do have a
boyfriend.

DOUG
There’s a rough gig. What do you
do, keep him chained in the basement?

 
 

KATE
Hale, at the moment, is working in
my father’s London office. He’s an
MBA. Harvard? Maybe you’ve heard
of it, they have a hockey team.

DOUG

Must be a very sharp guy.

suspicious)
I’1l bet. you look all right from
a couple thousand miles away.

Here, for us, everything is line. ,
Everything is grace. For pairs

KATE stares at DOUG, then turns to the WAITER.

KATE
I’d like the aparagus and the

lemon. No dressing. No oil.

The WAITER scribbles, turns to DOUG --

DOUG
Is there a burger on here?

You have a problem?

KATE .
No. You have the problen.

The WAITER stands-by uncomfortably.

DOUG

Blind date.

he orders)
I'd like a cheeseburger, a well-
done, friendly, all-American,
missionary-position, cheeseburger
please.

WAITER
I’m afraid, sir, that we don’t have
any ground beef in the house this
afternoon.

KATE

Food frightens him. He talks
tough but he’s actually a very
timid young man.

DOUG glares. THE WAITER looks back and forth nervously.

DOUG

Just bring me what she’s having.
WAITER

The Calamari, sir?
DOUG

Sure. - Just make mine well done.

WAITER
Well done isn’t really -

KATE
I’d love to see your expression,
but it’s not worth wasting the meal.
You just ordered squid salad.

You think I won’t eat squid?

KATE
I don’t think you can spell squid.

DOUG

ANTON
We break training today.

he pours the shots)
You are joining us, Martin?

DOUG and ANTON staring out over Long Island Sound, passing
a bottle of champagne, as the sun drops over the horizon.

ANTON

».+-Z was very imaginative thinker.
Big ideas. Dreams like cowboy
western. America, I am sure, will
be falling at my feet like drunk on
sidewalk.

(laughing at the memory)
Here I am! -- I am coaching nine
European Champions. I am coaching
seven World Champions. Four gold
Olympics. I am Burt Lancaster!

(a wistful pause)
So I come. I wait. Where is
Cadillac? Where is red carpet?
Big ideas need much feeding. Soon
is no more Burt Lancaster in mirror.

DOUG reaches in his pocket, pulls a LARGE TURKEY DRUMSTICK,
takes a bite and hands it to ANTON.

~ DOUG
¢’non, you’re telling me nobody
was interested?

“ANTON .
I speak no English. I have no

So what do you do with it all?

ANTON
I have daughter. In Leningrad.
I send dollars through Hungary.

DOUG
She’s a skater?

ANTON
No. My daughter is nurse.

DOUG nods. .A pause. ANTON watches him, suddenly serious.

ANTON
You wonder how I leave family
behind, yes?

DOUG
It’s none of my business.

ANTON

Selfish time. Much unpopularity
for me in Russia. Much unhappiness.
Is no excuse. Is explanation.

impatiently taping up a hockey stick. KATE looks over.

KATE
If you’re so bored, why don’t you
read?
DOUG

What? You mean a book?

KATE
That is a traditionally accepted
format, yes.
 

DOUG grunts.

Continues with the stick.

KATE

Don’t you ever read?
DOUG

Like what?
KATE

I don’t know, TV Guide?
DOUG

Hey, look, I can read.
KATE

So what’s the last book you read?

(he shrugs)

You were in college.

DOUG
The last thing I read in college
was the letter cancelling my
scholarship when I couldn’t play
anymore.

KATE
You must’ve had to read a book in
high school.

DOUG
I was a hockey player. I’ve been.
a hockey player since I was nine.
The only thing a hockey player has
to be able to read is the penalty
clock.

KATE
And they graduated you?

DOUG
Graduated me? They revered me.
I was a God.

KATE
What a tragic commentary on our
times.

: DOUG
State championships, my last game,
grown men wept like children. Two
hundred people carried me on their
shoulders around the ice until the
Minnesota State Police came to break
it up.

The ZAMBONI heads off the ice.

DOUG
You can bet your tights I never

freakshow like this.

ANTON

Children! On the ice please.

KATE stands, pulls her skate guards, turns to DOUG.
KATE ,
I’m surprised you don’t just chuck
it all and start your own think tank.
DOUG
You‘’re pretty sure I don’t know
what that means, aren’t you?

DOUG comes through the door. KATE grabs frantically for a
towel -- barely covering up as --

KATE
-- What the hell do you think
you're -- Did I say come in?

DOUG, holding a CRUDELY WRAPPED PACKAGE in his hands, stands
his ground, enjoying KATE’s discomfort as she quickly knots
the towel above her chest.
KATE
o- Get out! out this second!

DOUG smiles, eyes all over her.

DOUG
Kate, I handle the stuff all the
time, it’s not that big a mystery.

KATE stands there stiffly. Something challenged in her
expression. A moment as she recovers her poise.

DOUG
Merry Christmas. ‘
(offering the package)
Think fast.

He tosses the package -- she catches it, almost losing her
towel. She stares at him, and then opens her locker, pui:s
out a DESIGNER-WRAPPED BOX.

KATE
(hurling it at him)
Happy holiday.

DOUG snags it before it takes off his head. KATE starts to
open hers, DOUG watching. :

DOUG
Pretty tough, shopping for the
girl who has everything.

KATE
(looking down)
Oh...

DOUG
Actually, I didn’t have much time
to shop.

KATE holds a worn, vintage CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS JERSEY at
arm’s length.

KATE

Bobby Hull for chrissake -- I’ve had
that shirt for fifteen years!

No, no -- I like it. Realiy.
KATE finds a smile. DOUG cools.

KATE
So open yours.

DOUG starts on his gift -- pulling off the ribbon and then
his expression sours -- A BOOK. .-

DOUG
«.-"Great Expectations?"

KATE
(smiling)
It was that or "Curious George
Plays Hockey." I took a chance.

CUT To:
EXT. MANSION -- NIGHT

DOUG, dressed: in an ill-fitting, brown polyester suit and
black tie, stands with ANTON at the front door. THE DOOR
swings open --: the FULL RUSH OF A LARGE PARTY. JACK MOSELY
stands there smiling in a tuxedo.

JACK
Happy New Year! C’mon in!

cUuT TO:
INT. THE MANSION
DOUG and ANTON enter a big party, in the grand, upper crust
tradition. Prosperous MEN AND WOMEN, in tuxedos and evening
gowns. BUTLERS and WAITERS circle with champagne and trays
of food. A DANCE BAND plays from THE BALLROOM.

DOUG stares around, amazed. This is exactly how the other
half lives. And then his gaze settles on --

THE MARBLE STAIRCASE
KATE gathered with a GROUP OF PEOPLE. She is resplendent;

.devastating in a tight, .drop-dead, strapless.gown. We knew

she looked good, but we have never seen her like this. A
tall, sandy-haired, TUXEDOED MAN in his late twenties, puts
his arm around her waist, as the GROUP breaks into laughter.
DOUG stands there, gaping. A passing BUTLER proffers a
tray of champagne glasses. DOUG grabs one, drains it fast.

CUT TO:
INT. MANSION BATHROOM

PARTY SOUNDS (OS). DOUG at the mirror. Pulling at his hair.
Brushing his cheap suit. Tugging his tie. No improvement.
He’s never felt more like a hick in his life.

CUT TO:

INT. JACK’S STUDY/ TROPHY ROOM

PARTY SOUNDS (OS). DOUG alone, in a corner, staring at a
COLLECTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS distanced slightly from the rest.

INSERT THE PHOTOS -- Black and whites, with a texture and
atmosphere that dates them from the fifties. Featured in each
picture is a young woman skater, KATE’S MOTHER, in various
poses on the ice: Dancing -- Alone -- Surrounded by an Ice
Capades-type chorus line. She is beautiful, glamorous; the
glow of a powerfully unique personality shines through.

DOUG steps away from this shrine, starts for the door, when --

KATE
(entering)
~~ Hale?
(seeing Doug)
Oh...
DOUG

I was just looking --

KATE
Weren’t these doors closed?

DOUG
Sort of, but...

KATE moves aside; she wants him out. DOUG passes into --
THE HALLWAY
as KATE closes the doors tightly behind them.

KATE
It’s not a museun.

DOUG, about to apologize, realizes KATE is staring at his
outfit.

DOUG

(self-conscious)
Black tie, I thought --

KATE
Yes, your tie jis black.
DOUG stiffens, vulnerable, ready for her to lay him out.
, KATE
(softening)
Don’t worry about it.

DOUG
Anton should’ve told me.

 
 

44

KATE
It’s not that big a deal.

A WAITER passes with champagne. DOUG grabs two glasses,
desperate to change the subject.

DOUG
I was gonna tell you, that book
you gave me, it’s something else.

KATE
(with a smile)
Really? Are you using it as a
door stop or a coaster?

DOUG
(handing her a glass) .
Very funny. .

KATE
I don’t drink.

 

Dou. ‘ |
It’s only champagne.

KATE
I’ve never had a drink in my life.

DOUG
i e . You’re kidding, right?
(she stares back,
definitely not
kidding)
What is it, the calories?

KATE
(bristling)

Considering your knowledge of self
contrel is about as extensive as
your wardrobe, I’d hardly expect
you to understand.

DOUG
c’mon Kate, everybody’s got to
cut loose sometime. It’s New Years
Eve for chrissake -- one glass...

KATE
As thrilling as this moment may
be for you, it’s hardly what I
would describe as transformational.

THE MAN we saw with Kate on the stairs steps INTO FRAME.

NN , MAN
. Kate, there you are....

 
ur

THE MAN leans in -- suddenly aware of DOUG’s presence.

KATE
Hale, this is Doug. Doug Dorsey,
Hale Forrestal.

HALE is instantly focused. A quick patrician smile.

HALE
Well, finally...The Secret Weapon.
I’ve heard so much about you.

HALE offers his hand, DOUG stuck with the two glasses, nods.

HALE
May I?
(plucking one)
This calls for a toast.

DOUG chafes under HALE’s inspection.

DOUG
Let’s drink to the little people.

HALE blinks as DOUG drains his glass. KATE watches them.

HALE
I understand you were at the
University of Minnesota.

DOUG
For a while.

HALE
I played a little hockey myself.
For fun. :

DOUG
(flatly)
Yeah? Let me know sometime, we’1l
slap it around.

KATE
If you two will excuse me, naked
male insecurity really leaves me
cold.

KATE walks. HALE and DOUG left staring after her. HALE,
recovering his swagger, turns back to DOUG.

DOUG
So, dude, back for long?

A pause. HALE regards DOUG unpleasantly.

 

 
 

‘

aay
oO

HALE
Just several days. We/ve been very
busy in the London office. But
then I gather you’ve been on quite
a schedule as well.

Douc
Jack. likes to get his money’s worth.

HALE
I understand you've been giving
Kate a rough time of it.

DOUG
You know Kate.

HALE
Yes, I do. For quite a while.
And I don’t like to see her upset.

DOUG
I was you, I’d invest in blindfolds.

Before HALE can find his tongue, DOUG is walking away.

CUT TO:
THE PARTY -~- LATER

THE BALLROOM.: THE BAND really playing. On the dance floor,
ANTON tearing it up with a very spry DOWAGER.

CUT TO:
THE PARTY -- LATER

KATE stands near a buffet table with several SOCIALITES.
As THEY BANTER, KATE’S eyes drift across the room -~ her
expression souring as she watches --

DOUG -- ACROSS THE ROOM -- standing with TWO 18-YEAR-OLD
DEBUTANTES. We can’t hear what he’s saying from this far
away, but whatever it is, the DEBS are loving it; giggling

and flirting like crazy.

CUT TO:
THE PARTY -- LATER

THE CROWD gathered in the BALLROOM. THE BANDLEADER counting
down the final seconds of 1991 --

BANDLEADER

IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM -- DOUG alone in the doorway.

A FEW YARDS AWAY -- KATE reaches down to manuever HALE’s
hand off her ass. .
THE CROWD
...four...three...two...one...
HAPPY NEW YEAR! !!!

HORNS -~- CONFETTI -- "AULD LANG SYNE" == COUPLES embrace --

DOUG is grabbed by ONE OF THE DEBUTANTES for a big kiss,
and then he’s passed to THE SECOND DEBUTANTE, another kiss,
and then he’s handed over to AN OLDER WOMAN and --

SEVERAL YARDS OFF <= KATE pulled from HALE’s embrace into the
arms of AN OLDER MAN and then passed to ANOTHER MAN and the .
MUSIC’S GOING and COUPLES all over the room are doing the same
thing and KATE is surrendering to the moment when suddenly --

DOUG AND KATE

thrust into each other’s arms, instinctively moving toward
a kiss -- when suddenly THEY FREEZE. A dead stop. KATE
recoils. DOUG stiffens. And then, pretending it never
happened, they turn away into the crowd.

CUT TO:
THE BUFFET ROOM -~ MINUTES LATER

MUSIC echoing from the ballroom. DOUG enters, grabs a
BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE from an ice bucket and keeps on going.

CUT TO:
INT. KATE’S BEDROOM -- LATER

Dark. Kate’s gown crumpled in a mess on the floor. Hale’s
tuxedo folded carefully over a chair.

IN BED'-- HALE asleep and snoring. KATE, beside him, is wide
awake, looking tense and unsatisfied. She stands, pulling a
sheet around her, moving across the room to THE WINDOW.

She listens, then THROWS THE WINDOW OPEN and stares out.
The FAINT SOUND OF ROCK AND ROLL playing from somewhere.

. CUT TO:
INT. THE DOME -- NIGHT

POUNDING ROCK AND ROLL ECHOES THROUGH THE BUILDING. DOUG,
alone, on the ice. Hockey stick in hand. Dozens of pucks
littered around the ice. A private moment of total free-form
mania. DOUG skating, blitzing -- firing pucks against the
wall like a man possesed; like a man who has no choice but to
burn off his reckless energy before it kills him.

 
48

DISSOLVE To:
EXT. THE MANSION -- EARLY MORNING

ANTON stands at the front door, talking with KATE.

KATE
What do you mean, we’re taking
the weekend off?

ANTON

Just till Monday. Is three days.
He works very hard. We make much
progress.

(she’s waiting for

details)
Steam is needing to be blown off.
You know...outside contact....

KATE
When you say outside contact what
exactly are we talking about?

ANTON
Katya, please, is not boy. Is man.
Young vigorous man.
(he tries a smile)
Too much...solitude is not good.

. e@ KATE

ue We work seven days a week. We work
Thanksgiving. We work Christmas.
I have the flu, and we work. I have
a boyfriend in London, and we work.
I show up every day of the week and
skate a remedial pairs clinic so you
can play Dr. Frankenstein with this
goon! I show up ready to work every
day for nineteen weeks and now you
give him two days off so he can go
‘whoring around New York?

. ANTON

: Is not entirely correct.
(Kate stares)
He went to Boston. -

As THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT in his face.

DISSOLVE TO:
WHITE SCREEN

TWO PAIRS OF SKATES -- both in mid-air, SLICE INTO FRAME.
SUPER-SLOW MOTION as they turn, glistening above the ice.
. Touching down, the SLOW MOTION ACCELERATES -- MUSIC FADES
Vo. IN -- THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY -- SUPERIMPOSE:

 
NINE MONTHS LATER

KATE AND DOUG IN THE DOME -- skating the hell out of a real
routine. ‘ They’ve gotten very good -- arabesque into a double
toe loop throw -- KATE in the air -- landing in DOUG’s arms --
and into the big finish as THE MUSIC PEAKS -- a side-by-side
blur spin at center ice as THE NUMBER ENDS.

OFF THE ICE -=- JACK, ANTON, HALE, MARTIN, SEVERAL MAIDS and
HOUSEKEEPERS all applauding.

KATE AND DOUG -- rise from their finishing positions.
The nuclear winter of their past relationship has warmed
over time into a grudging respect.

KATE
You’re still rushing the Lutz.

DOUG
Maybe you just ought to go with it.
(Kate looks over,
Doug smiles)
Do what I do -- just close your
eyes and commit.

KATE is about to rebut, as JACK and ANTON bound onto the :-:e

JACK
Just tremendous! Tremendous!

HALE, in loafers, slips and slides awkwardly toward thes

HALE
Honey, you were terrific!

THEY ALL turn as HALE falls on his ass onto the ice.

CUT TO:
INT. A FANCY GREENWICH RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

THE CAMERA CIRCLES THE TABLE -- JACK, ANTON, HALE, KATE
A WAITER standing-by and FINALLY TO --

DOUG transformed -- at least partially: A well-tailored «..°
Tanned and fit. Long hair pulled back stylishly. Hardiy
the oafish rube we remember from New Year’s Eve party.

DOUG
I’1l have the terrine of seafood,
followed by the steak au poivre,
and I’d like that rare please.

The WAITER nods, backs away. JACK leans into the table

   
JACK
Let’s get down to business. It’s
Labor Day weekend, where do we stand?

ANTON
First is to get Douglas eligible.

DOUG
What’s that going to be like?

ANTON
For you is like test pilot taking
driver’s exam.

JACK
And then into the sectionals?

ANTON
We skip sectionals.

They turn -- this is news -- ANTON pulls a book from his
bag, places it on the table.

ANTON .
USFSA rule number eight-hundred
and twenty-three...
(he opens the book
begins to read--)
"Former World Team Pairs members
competing with eligible partners
may receive, upon application to
the Executive Council, a bye into
the National Championships."

DOUG
Straight to the nationals?
JACK
I love it.
KATE

You’re kidding.

ANTON
Rule is rule. Who expects former
champion to skate with unknown.
(he closes the book)
January five. New Orleans.

JACK
And then the Olympics in February.
(he grins)

I smell gold...
The table brims with confidence. Only ANTON dissents.
 

ANTON
Hopes perhaps must be scaled back.

DOUG
What’re you talking about?

ANTON

Figure skating is not like hockey.
Team scoring most goals does not
always win. This is yery small
world. People will not be rushing
to welcome us.

(looking around)
I am outsider. Douglas is freak.
Katya...well...

(he lets this go)
Let’s just say we are having three
strikes against us. To be winning
place on team we will have to be
best by very much.

JACK
So we’ll be the best.

HALE
(raising his glass)
To success. ,

DOUG
Hell, we can do better than that.
(Hale stops--)
I say we kick some butt.

+ JACK
That’s the ticket! -- Let’s drink
to kicking butt.

THEY clink glasses and sip -- KATE drinking soda.

HALE

I have another announcement to make.

(he looks at Kate) .
Jack’s seen fit to transfer me back
to the home office in New York, and
Kate and I...

(he hesitates)
«.ewell, we’re going to be married
this winter,

KATE
(correcting him)
I told you -- the Spring. After
competition.

HALE
Spring, winter, whatever.
 

52

JACK and ANTON break huge grins. HALE, beaming, puts his
arm around KATE’s shoulder,

CLOSE-UP -- DOUG -- as this news registers. He’s stunned,
and more than that, he’s stunned that he’s stunned. WE HOLD
ON HIM for this next:

JACK (OVER)
Oh Katie...it’s about time! I was
wondering how long I’d have to wait!

ANTON (OVER)
This becomes quite the night, Katya,
please, my kiss.

DOUG rallies, summons a hearty smile.

 

DOUG
Congratulations. That’s great.

HALE (OVER)
Show them the ring, Kate.

JACK (OVER)
My God...Now that’s a piece of ice.

STILL ON DOUG -- as the conversation DRIFTS AWAY away and --

curT To:
INT. A PUBLIC RINK

Brightly lit and practically deserted. On the ice, a

ten-year-old GIRL skates to the final chorus of "TOMORROW."

She almost falls, recovers, and it’s over.

OFF THE ICE -- THREE TEST JUDGES sit at a desk marked:
USFSA TESTING.

The JUDGES check off their scores and nod approvingly at
the GIRL, who nervously exits the ice.

WOMAN JUDGE
(calling around the rink)
Male senior pairs test. Skaters
twelve and thirteen, please.

IN THE RUNWAY

KATE AND DOUG wearing plain, elegant warm-up suits, emerge.
ANTON in the shadows behind then.

ON THE SIDELINES

The JUDGES and a SMALL GROUP of YOUNG SKATERS, PARENTS, and
COACHES gathered behind them, react with amazement:
 

\

GROUP
--Mommy, that’s Kate Moseley!
~-It’s Kate Moseley!
--Couldn’t be...
--My God, it is...

KATE AND DOUG skate to center ice, as the GROUP falls silent.

WOMAN JUDGE
(very surprised)
Kate, well... Nice to see you back.
KATE

It’s nice to be here.

MALE JUDGE
Whenever you're ready.

A beat. AND THEN MUSIC -- something simple and orchestral
-- begins to PLAY -- and KATE AND DOUG begin to skate.

THE JUDGES look blown away.

THE GROUP OF SKATERS AND PARENTS watch in awe. This is
something special and they know it.

cUuT TO:
INT. DOUG’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

The place is a mess, but a mess with a new slant -- BOOKS
littered all over -- SKATING TAPES stacked by the VCR.
DOUG is sprawled on the couch, reading. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

* DOUG
Who is it?

KATE (0.S.)
(through the door)
It’s me. Kate.

DOUG reacts, this is very unusual. He jumps off the couch,
glancing around the room, gauging the epic proportion of the
mess, but before he can jump into action --

KATE, dressed to go out, pushes her way in.

DOUG
Kate...

She stands there a moment, looking around curiously, as if
this were the first time she’d been here.

KATE
I came to say have a good trip.
You’re leaving in the morning.
 

DOUG
Yeah.

KATE
I brought the tape. Last practice.

uo
i

She lays the tape on the table, eyes moving around the roon.

KATE
I haven’t been up here in a long
time. Not since Brian.

DOUG watches her as she gives the place a real inspecticn.

DOUG
It’s a little different.

KATE
Brian had mirrors up all over.

DOUG .
Yeah, I took ‘em down. ~
{off balance)
It’s kind of a mess, I wasn’t --

KATE
(surprised)
Books...
DOUG)

Gotta pass the time, right?
KATE stops at a Playboy centerfold pinned to the wall.

KATE
I guess when you’re not reading...
{still snooping
she stops at--)

INSERT -- A DOZEN FRAMED PHOTOS OF THE 1988. OLYMPIC HOCKEY
TEAM -- featured prominently on the wall.

KATE
(staring at the
collection)
Ahhh...The Wall Of Shame.

DOUG
Laugh if you want. I look at it,
it keeps me going..

KATE
Is that what keeps you going?

DOUG
Everybody’s got something behind then.

 
 

vw
uw

KATE glances back.

DOUG
It’s not like I’m the only one
who’s got memories on the wall.

KATE digests this. Turns back to the pictures.

DOUG laughs.

She stares as

DOUG
Bet you can’t pick out the best
looking guy on the team.

KATE
The one with the mask.

DOUG
What keeps you going, Kate?
(she turns)
Do you really like to skate?

if ‘she'd never considered this question before.

DOUG
It’s just, sometimes -- well a lot
of the time, actually, it doesn’t
seem like you're getting off on the
stuff -- I mean, you’re great. You

work like crazy. You skate the

shit out of everything, but --

HALE (0S)
(calling from below)
Kate? -- You coming?

KATE
(calling down)
Be right there!
(back to Doug)
I’ve been skating for a very long
time. People expect me to skate
well. It’s what I do, it’s --

DOUG
That’s not what I mean.

KATE
(she laughs)
What is this? -- I stop up to say
have a nice weekend and you’re going
to start giving me training tips?

DOUG
I only asked if you liked to skate.
 

ue
ov

KATE
Everybody can’t just "close their
eyes," and throw themselves off
the cliff.

DOUG
Open or closed, doesn’t make any
difference, just as long as you jump.

A pause, before --

HALE (0S)
Honey, we’re running late!

KATE
(answering sharply)
I’1ll get there when I get there!

She turns back to DOUG, shaking her head. A beat.

DOUG
Going out?

KATE
Just a movie.

They stand there a moment, KATE lingering.

KATE
You might want to check out the
tape, your release into that twist
Axel looks a little hesitant.
(ribbing him)
Wouldn't want to look uptight
out there, would we?

DOUG catches her eye, they stand there for a moment, but it’s
enough of a moment to scare her. She starts to back away --

‘KATE
Well...see you Monday, I guess.

DOUG
You’re gonna miss me...

KATE smiles, eyes sparkling for just an instant.

KATE
I’ll struggle through.

And she’s gone. DOUG stands there a moment. He moves to
‘ the window, pulls the shade, stares down.

DOUG’S POV -- THROUGH THE WINDOW

as KATE and HALE get into a chauffeured car and pull away.

CLOSE UP ~- A HUGE BANNER

"WELCOME HOME Doug"

PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- THE BAR. The place is rocking.
This is clearly the place to be in Mahorn, Minnesota
tonight. No sign of DOUG or WALTER however.

BLONDIE, 25, cute, in a ripe, blowzy way, wearing a halter
top that does little to hide her ample charms, moves through
the crowd, balancing a pitcher of beer and two glasses --

DOUG and WALTER outside, alone, standing amidst empty kegs
and garbage. The TRAILER in the BG.

WALTER
(incredulous)

-- Eigure skating? Are you kidding

me, or what? -- Figure skating?

DOUG cringes, motions for WALTER to be quiet --

WALTER
Don’t shush me! ~- Jesus Christ,
Dougie, I just spent the last
eleven months telling everybody
and their brother that you were off
in the goddamned Merchant Marines!

DOUG
I just didn’t know how to tell you.

WALTER stares at him as if he were a total stranger.

WALTER
...Figure skating. Jesus...
DOUG
You know how we always talked about
the new bar, the place in town -- I’m
serious, this time next year, you
could be picking out chandeliers --

 

WALTER
-- Gimme a break already! Forget
about the new goddamned bar. I have.

DOUG
Walter, I swear -- I could go all
the way.

WALTER

All the way to where? I mean, come
on Doug -- you’re a hockey player for
crying out loud. If you’re lucky --
if you’re yery lucky -- this time
next year, you'll be inside a Snoopy
costume, skating in the frigging

Ice Capades.

DOUG
I’m telling you, I’m good.

WALTER
This is figure skating. You been
: @ gone a year. How good could you be?

. DOUG

You know me better than that! I’m
telling you I’m good and you better
believe me. And you better believe
I’m not working fifteen hours a day
every day of the week to win some
consolation prize. Christ, Walt, do
you know what an Olympic gold medal
is worth? -- We’re talking everything
from Wheaties boxes to snow tires!

WALTER
What about the girl? She as crazy
as you. are?

DOUG
In her own way.

WALTER looks at his little brother. Shrugs. Smiles.
WALTER

Let me break it to ’em slowly.

CUT TO:
INT. A FASHION SHOWROOM -- SAME TIME

TWO MANNEQUINS -- dressed in a matching pair of wildly-cu:
sequined skating outfits. DOUG, ANTON, KATE and a CLOTHINS
DESIGNER, a woman of 40, stare at these creations --

 

 

DOUG
Hey, if this is a joke, I’m ready
to laugh...

The DESIGNER pales. KATE stares at him. ANTON braces.

DOUG
Look, if anybody here thinks
I’m getting inside one of those
things they better guess again.

KATE
Marcia and I, quite honestly, we
thought it would look good on you.

- DESIGNER
Something sheer and well...
{admiring DOUG’s
physique)
You don’t want to hide your light
under a basket.

DOUG
Oh great. So now we’re hawking my
ass out there?

DESIGNER
Deo you know how long we’ve worked
on this?

DOUG
Do I care?

KATE

Marsha designs for all the top
pairs. She’s always done my outfits.

DOUG
(sarcastically)
Oh well, that changes everything.

CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP -- A STEREO RACK SYSTEM

Two CD PLAYERS side by side -- WE HEAR (QVER) A CHAOTIC
MIX OF MUSIC: a lush SYMPHONY of romantic strings competing
with the hard crunching beat of some serious ROCK AND ROLL.

THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONG THE TWO SETS OF HEADPHONE WIRES --
WIDENING TO REVEAL --

KATE’S BEDROOM -- THE MANSION

Large and luxurious. A pink, feminine, almost saccarine
decor. Everything in it’s place, except for the floor that
is covered with CDs -- hundreds of them scattered everywhere.

FINALLY TO -- KATE AND DOUG

both wearing headphones, sprawled on the floor, listening.

It looks as though this has been a long session, DOUG is
grimly sucking on a beer. KATE, turned away, does not look
Happy about what she’s listening to either. KATE rips off
her headphones -- the ROCK AND ROLL DISAPPEARS INSTANTLY FROM
THE TRACK.

KATE
(turning to Doug)
You’ve got to be kidding.

He can’t hear her. KATE leans to the stereo, shuts the
power. THE CLASSICAL MUSIC STOPS -- silence.

DOUG
(pulling off his phones)
-- What?
KATE

I said: You’ve got to be kidding.

DOUG
You didn’t like it? -- That’s one of
ny favorite tunes.

KATE
(reprising his earlier
costume complaint)
"on, well, that changes everything."

DOUG
Come on... You got off on it and
you’re afraid to tell me.

 
KATE stands.

She stares as

. KATE
Dream on. But what about the Chopin?
I should never have interrupted you,
you looked mesmerized.

DOUG
I was falling asleep.

Starts gathering her CDs in a huff.

DOUG
Kate, look, ten thousand other
skaters are gonna be cueing up the
same boring crap.

KATE
Chopin, for your information, is
hardly easy-listening.

DOUG
c'mon, it’s like the costumes, I
mean, let’s break a little ground.
Let’s kick a little ass.

. KATE
I keep telling you -- judges don’t
like to be shocked. They don’t even
like music with vocals. You throw on
a pair of jeans and try skating to
this stuff and the only asses in line
to be kicked will be ours!

DOUG
You really think we can win any other
way? Because I think Anton's right
-- I think we’re a freakshow. I think
we've gotta blow them away because
they’re never gonna let us brown-nose
our way into a medal.

KATE
You want to win, you play it straight.
DOUG
(with a smile)
Didn’t work for you before.

DOUG pulls one last CD from his pocket.

KATE
What’s that?

DOUG
(moving for the stereo)
I been saving this for last.
 

62

KATE
I think I’ve had enough. Let’s just
call it a night.

DOUG pops in the CD, punches it up. A DRUM BEAT FILLS
THE ROOM -- IT’S LOUD --'A SYNTH BASS THUMPS IN --

KAT:
Doug! .

DOUG
(offering his beer)
Have a sip. We’re gonna dance.

KATE
We are not.

DOUG puts down the beer and kicks away the other CDs as

THE MUSIC COMES ALIVE. There’s a lot of music in this film,
but this is The Song -- our hit single, and whatever else it
may be it’s definitely contemporary, urgent, and sexually
romantic. As THE MUSIC BUILDS, DOUG reaches for KATE’s hand.
She pulls away. DOUG decides to go it alone --

DOUG
(moving through it)

Okay...into the layback...one, two
three, four...and out -- a little
serpentine bullshit across the ice
and then double axel twist lift...
and whoaa...looking good, check her
out...what an arch...and this guy’s
not too shabby either, letting her
down soocco easy --

THE CAMERA FEATURES -- KATE, starting to smile, swaying
slightly to the music, as DOUG “skates" around the room.
She’s can’t help getting caught up in his enthusiastic vision.

DOUG
-- rounding the far turn, picking
up a little speed here -- she’s
smiling, she knows this is happening
-- this guy isn’t just good, he’s
incredible -- outside edges, and she
picks and -- gimme a break, nobody
nails a camel spin like this -- Talk
about poetry in motion --

Suddenly THE MUSIC STOPS -- DOUG caught in mid-move --
HALE, standing there, in robe and pajamas, half asleep.
HALE

Guys, it’s midnight. I’ve got
a six-thirty appointment.

HALE stares at KATE as DOUG grabs his coat and beer.

Think about it.

KATE alone on the ice, practices a spin. She comes out
of it and something catches her eye -- she stares.

OFF THE ICE -- RICK TUTTLE stands there watching her.

TUTTLE
You're still dropping your shoulder
on the exit.

_ KATE, shocked, skates closer for a better look.

TUTTLE
We had an exhibition up in Hartford.
I was ariving past.
(looking around) .
They remembered me at the gate.

KATE
What are you doing here?

TUTTLE
I thought you’d retired.

KATE
I changed my mind.

TUTTLE
I heard. You know what I think is
the saddest thing about sports:
people who stay too long at the party.
(he smiles)

You were a great champion, Kate.

We had a nice run. Maybe it ended
badly, but I blame myself for that.

KATE
What are you doing here, Rick?

TUTTLE
I’m saying I’d like to see you go
out a champion.

KATE
That’s the plan.
64

TUTTLE
If you’d wanted to skate that
badly, why didn’t you come to me?
I know we made some mistakes but --

KATE
? You spent ten years tying
me into knots!

TUTTLE
You were always difficult.

KATE

Is that how you tell it, Rick?
Because I remember it differently.
I remember a nine-year-old girl who
was willing to do anything to keep
people happy. And for Rick Tuttle,
my God...

(she laughs)
I skated through fire for you.
I turned myself inside out trying
to please you, and it was never,
ever enough, was it?

TUTTLE
I’m sorry you feel that way.
You meant a lot to this sport.
You still do.
(he pauses, shrugs)
I’d just hate to see you humiliated.

KATE stands there, defiance instantly replaced by doupt.

- KATE
Humiliated?

TUTTLE

(sensing blood)
Come on, Kate, this guy, a hockey
player...
: (he smiles)
I mean, let’s face it, trusting
partners has never been your strong
suit.

KATE takes a deep breath, willing herself calm.

KATE
Just so you know, before you get
the hell out of my building -- this
guy, this hockey player, is the
best skater I’ve ever been on the
ice with. He’s going to make you
cry he’s so good.
on

TUTTLE says nothing. A moment.

KATE
You know your way out.

TUTTLE nods, turns, and walks back and out the way he came.

KATE stands there, flushed. She skates to the runway,
lifts a bottle of water to her lips and stops cold --

THERE’S DOUG -- slouched in the shadows. He’s heard the
whole thing. He stands, starts slowly for the ice.

KATE ‘
(she means it)
You let me down, I swear to God,
I’ll knock out what’s left of your
teeth.

DOUG

(as he nears)
Don’t sweat it, Kate.

(pointing to his

ring finger)
Do me one favor, willya? Take off
the rock while we work. It’s
cutting the hell out of my hand.

She can only stare as he pulls his guards and hits the ice.

get more extension on that Lutz.

HALE
Did you hear me?
(Kate turns)
The place in New York. East seventy
sixth. I went with the broker.

KATE
You. went without me?

HALE
It’s not going to stay on the market
forever.
 

HALE leans closer, takes her hands.

HALE :
Why don’t you take off tomorrow?
Come in, we’ll have lunch, we can
look at it together.

KATE
Tomorrow? It’s just that...

HALE shakes his head, looks down -- pales --

HALE
Kate...the ring -- Where’s the ring?

KATE
(fumbling)
I, I took it off -- for practice

HALE nods, swallowing his displeasure. ‘KATE tries to smile.
In the BG, the PRACTICE TAPE finishes rewinding and STARTS

INT. THE MANSION LIBRARY -- NIGHT

Transformed into competition headquarters. VIDEO and
COMPUTER EQUIPMENT strewn all over. DOUG, ANTON, and a
COMPUTER TECHNICIAN move aside, ushering KATE to the seat

Please to show her...

INSERT -- THE MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- A sports imaging
program -- The TECHNICIAN TAPS on the KEYBOARD -- and the
screen comes alive ~- green pixel silhouettes of KATE and
DOUG begin moving across the ice -- and then explosion as
KATE’s silhouette leaves the ice in slow-motion high into
the air -- around...and around...and around and into the
arms of DOUG‘s silhouette --

KATE sits back from the computer. Stares at them all.

DOUG
I thought we’d call it a Pamchenko,
but Anton’s not into it, so it’s a
slingshot triple.

ANTON
Key is centrifigal explosion of
body from outside pick -- Is very
exciting, yes? Cutting edge of

KATE looks pale. She stares at them. They’re not kidding.

KATE

This is what you’ve been doing?

No one does a three and half!
Nobody even thinks about it!

DOUG
That’s the whole point. Kate, this

KATE

DOUG ..
I’ll be right there.

RICK TUTTLE. TWO OTHER SKATING OFFICIALS look on.

TUTTLE .

-- When the Jack Moseley’s of this

mercenary coaches, put skaters on

No, Hale -- it’s not here!

Fine! 1/11 do everything myself!

She storms back into the house. HALE stares after her.
DOUG watches all this with an air of detached amusement.

HALE
She’s very tense.
(Doug nods)

It’s understandable. The pressure
is enormous.

(Doug nods again)
Her drive for perfection, it’s
something I’ve come to admire.

(he hesitates,

measuring Doug

before--)
You seem to have mastered a sort
of, I don’t know, a technique for
@ handling her, I wondered if... .
‘ (this is difficult)
«-.It’s just that, if this were a
business situation, for example,
and I knew that my dividends were
shrinking and my assets were, let’s
say, undervalued, and my market
strategy was cratering despite my
best efforts, I’d probably think
about bringing on a consultant of
some kind. You know, shake up
my thinking. New perspective.

DOUG
I’d suggest a more aggressive,
take-charge approach.

HALE
You mean, standing up to her?

DOUG
I’d try making it to my knees first,
but that’s the right idea.

DOUG stopped at the RUNWAY, staring into THE ARENA. Thirty
thousand empty seats. DOUG swallows. The enormity of the
situation dawning on him as he looks out onto the ice he’1l
be skating on. He turns to see --

KATE, as mad as we’ve ever seen her, storming back up the

JACK and SIX NEW YORK LAWYERS are seated across from THUMAN,
TUTTLE, and SEVERAL USFSA OFFICIALS. The mood is tense.

THUMAN :
..-Rick’s raised some serious v4
allegations about Dorsey’s amateur
status. I know you’ve flown your
people down, Jack, but I’m doubtful
we can clarify this in the next ten
hours. ‘

The HEAD LAWYER is about speak, when JACK waves him off --

JACK
There isn’t a skater. in this hotel
who doesn’t have a blind trust, club
sponsor, or --

TUTTLE
-- That’s absurd!

JACK

Since Mr. Tuttle seems incredulous,
I think we owe him the courtesy of
enlightenment, and to make it easy,
I suggest we start by exploring the
unique "scholarship" arrangement his
skaters receive at the University
where he so nobly acts as a tenured
professor of...

(drawing a blank)
What is it exactly, Rick that you’re
a professor of?

TUTTLE
This is outrageous!

JACK
My feelings exactly.

THUMAN
-- Gentlemen, please!
JACK
Let’s cut to the cherry, Gerald.
You cheat my kids out of their
chance to skate and I’1l bury your
butts so deep in legal compost it’1ll

way out. Is that clear enough?

KATE
Don’t worry, it’s a head game.

TWO.SKATERS COME SPEEDING PAST -- DOUG flinches.
KATE
Yumez and Weaver. They cry on

ANOTHER PAIR -- TWINS -~- almost identical, come twirling

I’ll be fine.

KATE AND DOUG first position. MUSIC SWELLS -=- something
explosive and bold -- and they begin to skate. And we've
never really seen them in action, and we’re not going to «atch
much of this, but what we do see is impressive before --

THE CAMERA SWINGS TO FIND --

ANTON -- watching from the sidelines nervously.

THE JUDGES -- scoring, faces impossible to read.

What a night for skating!

JOJO
And the headline in New Orleans
tonight is Kate Mosely returning to
the Nationals with a new partner,
ex-hockey player Doug Dorsey.

scoTr
_I/11 admit it, Jojo, when I heard
about this couple I thought they had
to be kidding, but Doug Dorsey --
Wow! I guess you’d have to say he’s
the Bo Jackson of the skating world.
There’s a lot of shocked people in
this town tonight.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT .

DOUG, ANTON and KATE exiting the ELEVATOR, skate bags over
their shoulders. THEY’RE LAUGHING, basking in the moment of
victory, wandering up the hallway as WE HEAR OVER:
JOJO (OVER)
Brian Neuman and Lorie Paulsen, no
surprises there, take the number one
spot. John and Jody Weiderman skate
a very safe but proficient number two
and Kate Mosely and Doug Dorsey come
out of nowhere to grab the three spot.

Amid "goodnights," ANTON breaks off -- his room in the next
wing. KATE and DOUG continue on, still laughing as:

SCOTT (OVER)
But three into to two won’t go, and
two couples is all the U.S. will be
sending to the Olympics this year.

JOJO (OVER)
Tomorrow afternoon’s long program
should be very exciting.

V.O. FADES OUT -- KATE slows as they near her room.
' KATE
..if they were giving french fries
instead of trophies, then you’d see
her air it out.
DOUG laughs. KATE stops at her door.

KATE
See you tomorrow?

I might be free.

KATE shakes her head, finds her key. DOUG backing away.
DOUG
Hey, Kate...

Hey.

LORIE

JOJO and SCOTT broadcasting.

JOJO
It’s hard to explain sometimes to
people outside the sport, but
scoring can really reflect more
than what’s happening out on the ice.
scoTT
The judges have their favorites, and
this evening I’m not sure if Kate
and Doug fall into that category.

JOJO"
I thought that was a super program,
but with the top two seeded pairs
still to skate, it looks like Kate
and Doug are headed for third place.

CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE LOCKEROOMS

DOUG and KATE alone. He’s raging -- storming around the
hallway, absolutely furious. KATE looks ready to ery.

DOUG
-- This is horseshit! What kind of
crap are they trying to pull? -- We
skated our asses off out there!

KATE bites her lip, watching him rail around the hallway.

DOUG
(wildly)
: i ! -- I mean, am I crazy
or did we just nail that goddamned
program to the wall?

He’s scaring her, she’s never seen him like this. SEVERAL
PASSERSBY glance over nervously.

OTHER SKATERS AND COACHES look: on as ANTON pulls KATE and
DOUG into an ecstatic embrace. KATE transformed instantly,

We need to see the skaters alone.

KATE
I guess I’m just sort of worked up.

The WOMAN moves to a cooler. Opens it. KATE looks in.

WOMAN
I have Coke, Sprite, Gatorade...

KATE
Is that a beer in there?

The WOMAN pulls a Budweiser, hands it over. KATE pops the
top, braces, and takes a sip. She smiles. She likes it.

Awards ceremony. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC booms through the arena
as the top three pairs wave to the crowd. BRIAN AND LORIE
standing on the top step. KATE AND DOUG right below in
second. THE WEIDERMAN TWINS, looking grim, in third.

DOUG looks stunned. KATE is beaming, blowing kisses to the
house. THE CROWD ROARING. She turns for a different angle,
and loses her footing -- almost slipping off the platform.

DOUG
(catching her)
You all right?

KATE
I’m wonderful!

And you’re wonderful too!

DOUG looks over. She’s not tipsy, she’s drunk. Beyond
her, LORIE is watching, measuring DOUG’s reaction.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DRESSING ROOMS

A crush of PEOPLE: WELL-WISHERS, REPORTERS, SKATERS, COACHES,

the CROWD, pass RICK TUTTLE giving an interview. JACK stops,
taps the REPORTER on the shoulder. He turns --

TUTTLE

Jack, Anton, congratulations.

JACK

KATE
Of course we can! Come on...

DOUG, unsure, glances back up the hallway to see LORIE and
BRIAN surrounded by a CROWD OF WELL WISHERS.

KATE

It’s our night. We can do whatever
we want!

DOUG

Lights shimmering in the moonlight. MUSIC UP -- we’re
going into a MONTAGE here, a series of quick shots.

jumps out, ready to party. DOUG struggles to catch up.

-- A CLUB ON BOURBON ST. Packed and hopping. KATE at the
crowded bar, waving wildly for the BARTENDER. DOUG standing
behind her, looking off-stride.

DANCING and DRINKING. KATE and DOUG at a table. She finishes
the final sip of some tropical concoction. DOUG nursing a

signals for another round. DOUG tries to wave her off, but
too late.

~-- CLUB #3. This place is really rocking. A BLUES BAND

ON STAGE. The CROWD going nuts. DOUG watches KATE with
disbelief -- she’s got her hair down, sweater off, chugging on
yet another cocktail. Suddenly, she turns, takes his hand and
before he knows what’s happening she’s leading him out onto
the crowded dance floor. She’s a wild woman. DOUG can’t
resist any longer -- they’re dancing.

DISSOLVE. To:
INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR BANK

END MUSIC AND MONTAGE. THE ELEVATOR DOORS SWING OPEN TO

At least it’s passionate from her standpoint, DOUG yuits

DOUG
We’re here.

KATE looks up. .She’s bombed. DOUG leads her out.

CUT TO:
THE DOOR TO KATE’S HOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

DOUG turns the key, opens the door, and stands aside.

KATE

...Of course you are, you are,

She takes his hand, stumbling forward, pulling him into --
HER HOTEL ROOM
DOUG extracts his hand. KATE turns clumsily.

KATE
Aren’t you going to ask me te dance?

DOUG
I don’t think so.

KATE:

Oh, Doug...Douglas, silly thing,
please, please don’t talk about
thinking. That’s what I love about
the way I feel right now. I feel —
like even if I tried I couldn’t think
and I’ve been thinking so much for
so long and it’s sooococoe tiring...

(she giggles)
...the world is spinning and
spinning and spinning and I couldn’t
care less...

DOUG stands there. KATE begins to unbutton her blouse.

KATE.
-+-I/m looking at you and I’m
seeing how you must’ve been as a
little boy...
(eyes weaving)
.-.Hockey shirt hanging out.
Bandaids on your knees...

Her fingers fumble with the buttons. She’s really gone.

KATE

Did you ever play with magnets
when you were little? -- Of course
you did, everyone did. You know
how you’d turn them one way and
they’d push away? You’d run them
around the table, pushing then,
and then all you had to do was
just flip them over and suddenly...

(she smiles)
...don’t you see, that’s why
everything’s been so awful...

(the last button)
..-we just needed a little flip.
93

DOUG
Not tonight, Kate. Not like this.

She stands there. Her expression darkens.

KATE
Not like what? Not like me?

DOUG
That’s not it. Kate, you’re bombed.

KATE
(trying to focus)
What are you talking about?

DOUG
You ought to sit down. Drink a lot
of water. Try and get some --

KATE

(exploding)
Oh God, just what I need -- somebody
else telling me what to do!

(she steps back,

nearly falling)
In case.you missed it, I’m throwing
myself at you!

(pulling her blouse

around her)
I’m standing here tearing off ny
clothes and you’re giving me a
rundown of drinking do’s and don’t’s!

- DOUG
I think maybe I know a little bit
more about it than you.

KATE
I get enough coaching on the ice!

DOUG stiffens. He stands there, lost for a moment.

KATE
Get out.

DouG
You’ve got this all wrong.

KATE
Do I ever!
(bitterly)
Excuse my surprise, but really...
how disappointing -- God’s gift to
reckless abandon revealed as nothing
but a prude in wolf’s clothing!

DOUG
What the hell does that mean?

KATE
It means I’m sick to death of your
hormone-rattling sermons about the
raptures of free-spirited behavior!

She’s woosy, barely able to get this out and stay standing.
DOUG colors, stiffly trying to contain his anger.

DOUG
You’re a lousy drunk.

KATE
And you’re a lousy date.

DOUG
It didn’t have to be like this.

KATE
I said: Get out.

DOUG turns, walking quickly back through the door -- and he’s
gone. KATE drops onto the bed.

CUT TO:
INT. DOUG’S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER

FOUR EMPTY MINI-BAR BOTTLES OF VODKA are lined up in a row.
DOUG, shirt off, sits in the half darkness, staring out tne
window. He’s drinking, putting on the buzz he refrained {rss
all night. He’s moved past the stage of trying to make sense
of the past twenty-four hours, now just drinking to put
himself to sleep. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. DOUG comes to. .

He shakes his head, crosses the room.

DOUG
(opening the door)
Kate, I really --

LORIE PAULSEN stands there, dressed to kill, holding severa:
bouquets of flowers. She peeks inside.

LORIE
You alone?
. (Doug stands there,
. speechless)
You like roses?

DOUG makes no move to take them. LORIE slides in past nia.
shutting the door behind her.

LORIE
That’s one thing about skating, the
fucking flowers can drive you crazy.

 
 

; DouG
Lorie, listen...

She slinks into the room, looking it over.

LORIE ’
I waited for you. I guess we got
our wires crossed.

DOUG
Yeah. I guess.

LORIE
(looking for a place
for the roses)
Must be nice for Kate, skating with
a man who doesn’t keep a vase around.

LORIE turns. She looks incredible.

LORIE
I watched your program. You’ve

secrets.

KATE asleep on the bed, fully clothed, just as we left her.

sledgehammer throb of her first, epic, hangover. She groans.
And then her expression dissolves from pain to panic, as the

previous night’s events begin to leak back in.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- DAWN

CUT TO:

KATE stands weakly before at a HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She steadies

herself, battling the pounding agony of her hangover.

makes a half-hearted effort to pull herself together, worrying
her hair, rubbing her eyes, trying her injured best to look

She

presentable. She summons a smile, and KNOCKS ON THE DOOR.

A pause. And then the door opens.

LORIE PAULSEN, holding only a pillow over her naked body,

stands in the doorway.

KATE
I...I must have the wrong roon.

 
LORIE
Yes. I’d say so.

KATE starts to back away. LORIE standing there, when --

DOUG’S VOICE
(groggily, from inside)
What the hell’s going on?

KATE freezes.

LORIE
(to Kate)
A little early for practice, isn’t it?

DOUG, in the BG, pulls a sheet around him, coming for the
door -- no idea what’s happening -- moving sleepily behind
LORIE -- and then his jaw drops -- his eyes meet KATE’s.
She turns -- bolting down the hallway --

DOUG
oh shit...

DOUG pushes past LORIE, rushing out into the hall, nearly
colliding with SEVERAL HOTEL GUESTS exiting the next roon.

DOUG
-- Kate! Wait a minute...! Kate,
come on, just --

KATE

(wheeling on him)
-- You pig! You complete, total,
unreedemable pig!

(he stops cold)
How? -- How could you? My God, to
think I was coming to apologize and
and all the while you were in there
with her!

DOUG
Kate, that’s not --

KATE .
-- Don’t! Don’t even try! Don’t
you dare say one more word!
(Doug stands there)
My God, just looking at you makes
me sick!

She turns away. The HOTEL GUESTS look on, shocked.

DOUG charges after her, the sheet flapping round him as he
grabs for her -- KATE yanks herself free --

KATE
-- Get your hands off me!

KATE strides for her door. DOUG struggling after.

DOUG
Maybe I missed something along the
way, but I don’t remember making
promises to you about anything.

KATE
(pure disgust)
-- my God...

DOUG jumps between her and her room. MORE GUESTS peer out
from doorways up and down the HALLWAY.

DOUG
One question -- one -- Were you, or
were you not, engaged to be married
until the day before yesterday?

KATE" /
That is hardly the point!

DOUG
Maybe you’d rather replay the moment
you bounced me out of your room.

KATE
Count your blessings -- she might
not have waited much longer.

DOUG
That’s not how it happened.

KATE
‘You can spare me the details!

DOUG
Fine! -- Then let me just hit the
highlights: For fifteen months
you act like I’m a cross between
a trained dog and your worst
nightmare. And then -- in the space
of three hours -- I’m supposed to
be falling at your feet, thanking ny
lucky stars because you’ve just
gotten drunk enough to decide I’m
worthy of your attention. Well,
excuse me, I’m really fucking
sorry, but I can’t downshift that
fast!

KATE pulls her key. Stares at him grimly.

. KATE .
Get out of my way.

DOUG moves aside. KATE jams her key into the lock.

DOUG
That’s all you have to say?

KATE
No. No, I have one more thing to
add: From now on, from this minute
until we finally, mercifully, go
our separate ways, our relationship
is strictly business.

KATE ploughs into her room. The DOOR SLAMS SHUT. DOUG

JACK enters to join ANTON on the sidelines as KATE and DOUG

ANTON
I need to know, what do we skate

JACK
You mean this new triple? You’re

KATE

I guess I’m just taking a moment

ceremonies.

LORIE
(to Kate)
Trouble in paradise?

DOUG
(wheeling on Lorie)
Get the fuck away from my partner.
Heads turn. LORIE stiffens. BRIAN pulls her away.

KATE
(shocked)
You didn’t have to do that.

DOUG
Better late than never.

A beat. KATE unsure what this means, about to ask, when
something draws her attention off the ice. THEY BOTH TURN --

IN THE RUNWAY -- TWO YQUNG ASIAN SKATERS moving with a large
ENTOURAGE OF HANDLERS and SECURITY PEOPLE toward the ice.

DOUG
Izuto and Tenaki...

IZUTO AND TENAKI laughing with their COACHES, real loose.

KATE
God, they look so young.

DOUG
They’1l age a little when they see
our slingshot triple.

KATE-
We’re not doing it.

DOUG turns back. This is news. The BUZZER SOUNDS.

. DouG
What do you mean?

KATE
I’m taking it off the progran.
It’s too dangerous.

Without another word, she skates away.

CUT To:
INT. CHATEAU DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

A baronial table looks empty with just KATE, DOUG, ANTON
and JACK spread around it. RAISED VOICES ECHO through the
chateau’s gothic hallways -- A heated argument in progress:

DOUG
-- I’d just like to know why I busted
my nuts for five weeks on a move she
never had any intention of trying!

ANTON
-- Douglas --
 

KATE
-- Will you please remind him the
number of possible point reductions
we're talking about here!

DOUG
Oh bullshit! -- You don’t want to
win! You just want to get through
this without dusting your precious

ass!

JACK
Whe the hell do you think you’re
talking to?

DOUG

Stuff it, Jack! This is between us!
JACK sits there, stunned. DOUG turns back to KATE.

DOUG
Bronze, silver, honorable goddamned
mention -- It doesn’t really make a
aifference to you at all, does it?
You’re a rich girl -- So what if you
come up a little short, right?

ANTON
. Douglas -- stop!
Silence. DOUG stands, stares at her across the table.
DOUG
Just so you know: I’m working without

anet here. Losing gracefully does
shit for me!

KATE, staggered, sits back, says nothing.
JACK
It’s up to her. She doesn’t want
to do it -- it’s out!
DOUG turns to ANTON. No help here. DOUG walks.

You forgot a button.

DOUG
No, I want it like that.

In the BG, HASTINGS AND MULGREW come off the ice.

It looks like shit.

DOUG

KATE

KATE
I’m asking you for the last time.
(Doug ignores her)
Button the goddamned button.

DOUG
Get over it.

KATE
You are an immature asshole of
the lowest order.

That’s it. DOUG snaps. His grip tightening at her waist.

DOUG
(still smiling)
If it was forty below and that button
meant the difference between a long,
satisfying life and a horrible death
by hypothermia, I still wouldn’t give
you the fucking satisfaction.

THE BUZZER GOES OFF =~ it’s showtime.

MUSIC PLAYING as KATE and DOUG move through the final passes

anger, the distance between’ them is visible -- into a double
split Lutz twist lift -- KATE in the air -- and down and DOUG

hovering over her at center ice as the MUSIC CRASHES IT’S
FINISH. They stand, bowing stiffly to the APPLAUSE, before
skating for the runway.

PEGGY AND DICK -- the two NETWORK ANNOUNCERS, break in.

DICK
Technically superior program,
Peggy, but did you feel, as I did,
that there was something missing?

' PEGGY
Absolutely, Dick. They delivered all
the short program required moves but
it seemed cold -- more like we were
watching two individual athletes than
a fluid pair. They just didn’t look
like they were having fun out there.

DICK
And here come the scores --

Stiff smiles harden. DOROTHY leans in with the mike.

DOROTHY
Kate, it looked like you two were
having trouble connecting out there.
(she waits, Kate is
silent)
Did you feel like your energy might
have been a little down?

An awkward moment. KATE can’t find her tongue.

DOROTHY
(still probing Kate)
Was the altitude a problem?

KATE hesitates, too tight to talk. DOUG jumps in --

pous /
The ice was lousy. We were off our
game. Well be back tomorrow -- Okay?

DOROTHY, thrown, stares over as DOUG pulls KATE OUT OF FRAME.

KATE, in street clothes, stands there lifelessly. ANTON,
furious, stares over as DOUG, carrying his skate bag, looking
very sour, strides toward then.

ANTON
(disgusted)
What a long way to be coming for
such garbage skating.
109

DOUG
(in no mood)
Look, I’1l see you later. I. gotta
walk it off.

ANTON
No. Absolutely no. We go back.

DouG
I said, I’m going for a walk.

ANTON steps forward, just about to really get into it when --

KATE

Let him go!

(they turn)
If he’s smart, he’ll walk all the
way back to Minnesota and forget
this ever happened!

(she looks wild)
He didn’t screw up out there. He
came to skate ~- just like he always
does -- to skate and win and try to
make something out of all this crap.

(tears welling)
It’s my fault. Me. I’m the one
who screwed it up.

ANTON
(moving for her)
Katya, please...

KATE
Stop! Don’t-you dare try and baby
me. I’m the one whd’s. responsible
and I deserve to feel exactly as
lousy as I do right now!
(staring at Doug)
I’m sorry. I’m very, very sorry.

And now, before she starts to sob, she turns -- running
as fast as she can away down the hall. ANTON following --

ANTON
Katya! -- Katya, wait!

DOUG, staggered, stands there, watching them disappear,
digesting what’s just occured. Finally, he takes a deep
breath, muscles his skate bag over his shoulder, turns,
and starts walking in the opposite direction --

KATE
(almost to herself)

We come around that far turn and
we're picking up speed and we’re
going so fast and I keep telling
myself I should be concentrating
on my free leg and my grip, but
all I can think about is how much
I don’t trust him. And then, the
moment I’m in the air, all I can
think about is how much I don’t
trust myself.

’ ANTON
(gently)
Katya, Slingshot is out. Is done.
We will skate New Orleans program
. and’ it will be wonderful. .

KATE says nothing. They stare out into the distance.
ANTON

I have decided these are the most
beautiful mountains I have ever seen.

KATE
I’m retiring after tomorrow.
For real.

ANTON

Is not unexpected news.
liz

KATE
He'll find another partner.
He’s good enough.

ANTON
He will find no one like you.
No matter what he does.

KATE ponders this. A long pause.

KATE
Think he’1ll be back tonight?

ANTON
He‘ll make it.

Anton smiles)

KATE nods. Pulls the coat more tightly around her.

practicing silently. Skating on eggshells.

KATE and DOUG stand quietly with ANTON as THE OPENING
NOTES OF "PEER GYNT" begin in the BG..

All mistakes. All difficulty. Ail
effort. Everything is burned away

falls away except perfection.

DOUG
You okay?
KATE nods tightly.
KATE
You?
DOUG
I guess.

They hesitate. A silent moment. Neither of them quite able
to find the words. As suddenly --

IZUTO AND TENAKI -~ five yards away -- come sweeping off the
ice, into the arms of their ENTOURAGE. Hugs and kisses and
LOTS OF JAPANESE CONGRATULATIONS and NETWORK PRODUCTION PEOPLE
trying to get the couple over to DOROTHY HAMILL in the
INTERVIEW BOOTH. And judging by the activity and reactions,
this event is over.

KATE frozen, watching all this. She turns to find --

DOUG still staring at her, the rest of the world lost for hin.

DOUG

I can’t stand this anymore.
KATE .

Doug, we have to skate...
DOUG

This won’t wait four and half

minutes.

(in a rush)
Kate, look, maybe I’m a jerk. Maybe
I wasn’t ready. Maybe I was afraid.
I don’t know. I just have this
terrible feeling that after today
I’m not gonna see you again and...
I don’t care about the skating, I
just.don/t.want it to end for us.

KATE stares. Both of them terrified by what’s just been said.

KATE
Doug...no...we’re not right for
each other -- We’re not.

DOUG
Yes we are! I’m right for you.
I know it. I fee) it.

KATE

It would never work.

DOUG
It already has! -- We’ve just been so
goddamned wrapped up in the rest of
this stuff that we couldn’t see it.

KATE
It’s too complicated.

DOUG

There’s nothing complicated about it.

(he steps closer)
Kate, I never met anybody like you
before. It took me a long time to
get used to it but now...

Who else is gonna put up with your
shit?

KATE, reeling, as THE CROWD AROUND THEM COMES ALIVE -- THE
FRENCH ANNOUNCER BEGINS READING THE SCORES (QVER) --

KATE AND DOUG stand there -- suddenly aware of the situation.

No. No way.
A hovering OLYMPIC OFFICIAL leans in --

OFFICIAL
You may take the ice please.

KATE

I thought you wanted to win. I know
you do. I’m the one who put us in
this hole, and I say it’s the triple.

DOUG
-- Look at me!
(grabbing her back)
The last thing I want to do is start
running your life.

KATE
So we’re agreed. Triple.

DOUG
No! -- It’s not worth it. You don’t
have to do this for me.

THE CROWD GOES QUIET. DOUG and KATE, side-by-side.

DOUG :

She turns -- total, utter, heart-stopping shock. And then
she smiles ---a big, confident smile.

” KATE
Then how could we possibly miss?
