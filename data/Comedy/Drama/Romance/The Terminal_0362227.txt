FADE UP
ON A BLUR OF FACES

They gradually come into focus along with the noisy chatter
of a hundred different languages - from Swahili to Waray-
Waray and Tajik to Cantonese.

’ The PASSENGERS pour into the bright fluorescent light of the
Arrivals Hall of a vast, anonymous International Terminal,
expressions grim from seemingly endless journeys across
seemingly endless Time Zones.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - OBSERVATION DECK. DAY.

A log jam of people in the immigration hall. A plastic-looking
Christmas tree in the corner, incongruous in the stark
surroundings.

At the far end of the vast hall, Senior Immigration Officer,
MERCER, and his younger assistant THURMAN, stand on an
observation platform, gazing out at the multi-colored sea of
humanity.

The older man leans across to his subordinate, offering him
the benefit of all his eighteen years of experience in the
Immigration and wets tion Service -

When the " @ third world flush,
Thurman, all EES comes pouring

Thurman nods. % 9
INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - TION LINE. DAY.

Close on POLISHED LEATHER SHOES stepping calmly through the
doorway into the Arrivals Hall.

We move up an inexpensive but exquisitely maintained brown
suit, a crisp white shirt and a plain silk tie to find VIKTOR
NAVORSKI, 40s, bloodshot eyes filled with excitement.

Though pushed and shoved like everyone else Viktor remains
somehow unruffled, at peace almost, his eyes finding -

THE STATUE OF LIBERTY

seen through a window up ahead, sunlight glistening
beautifully off the Hudson.
MANHATTAN

stands proudly behind, framed perfectly, her incandescent
grandeur set against an immaculate azure sky.

Viktor is exuberant. He moves toward it...

But his smile starts to fade as he realizes there's no water,
no gigantic monument, no city...it's just an elaborate model
of New York.

GUARD
Please step back into the line, sir.

Viktor turns te see a pair of uniformed Immigration GUARDS
supervising the line.

He smiles again, staking the first Guard's hand. Viktor's
accent is of an indeterminable, though clearly European origin -

VIKTOR
Thank you for having me.

The bemused Guard shakes Viktor's hand, glancing at his
colleague -

Gi
I said step 26S

in.
Viktor steps back, a litle tated.
As the line moves past rows /6fo identical counters Viktor

catches a glimpse of the dist. eting area through several
sets of swinging double doors. ©

to the line, sir.

For a brief moment he makes out DS <acitea FAMILY holding up
a makeshift sign - "WELCOME HOME".

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - LATER

VIKTOR reaches the front of the long line and hands his
passport to an OFFICER.

OFFICER
Welcome to the United States, Mr.
Navorski. Business or pleasure?

The Officer runs Viktor's new passport through a scanning

machine, glances up again to see Viktor still smiling back
at him.
Viktor carefully considers the question for several beats.
Then several more -

OFFICER
(impatient)
Business or pleasure?

Viktor's just about to answer when the scanning machine makes
a strange BEEP.

Checking his computer screen the Officer picks up his phone,
regarding Viktor suspiciously all the while -

OFFICER
Mr. Mercer? I have a UV-I on nine.

Viktor turns to the African WOMAN waiting behind him in line
with her two young SONS. He smiles.

When he turns back, several OFFICIALS, including THURMAN are
standing in front of him.

THURMAN

butchering the name) ~

To the Officer behind the vol pey finally decided on
VIKTOR
Pleasure.

As Viktor follows Thurman, the other officials fall in behind
him.

INT. IMMIGRATION HOLDING AREA - DAY
Busy, dark and loud in here. The sound of dogs BARKING.

Flanked by the Officials, a bewildered Viktor is led down a
hallway past several doors, some of them open -

A young Chinese MAN shakes with fear. He holds his right

hand up in the air and swears an oath to an INTERVIEW OFFICER
while an INTERPRETER translates.
4.

poGs rip into the casing of an ARAB COUPLE's luggage while
OFFICERS look on, ignoring the couple's desperate pleas.

Viktor looks back down the corridor again, briefly making
eye contact with a terrified VIETNAMESE REFUGEE whose baby
is taken away from her by a female OFFICER before she's
unceremoniously forced into a holding cell.

At the far end, Thurman holds open the door for his UV-I.
Viktor enters, looking back concerned at the wailing child.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Viktor sits in silence for several long beats. The door opens.
Mercer appears.

Viktor stands to attention, knocking his chair back.

MERCER
Please. Sit down, Sir.

Viktor sits down again, nervous. Mercer sizes him up. An
uncomfortable silence.

MERCER
What are you doing in the United States,
Mr. Navorski? ‘

 

Viktor smiles awkwardly. antly -
VI
I am on vacation: / o
Mercer, expression smpenctvant/, eS at Viktor.
MERCER
What do you plan on doing during your
vacation?
VIKTOR
Vacation.
A beat.
MERCER

You said vacation.

VIKTOR
Yes...I did.

Mercer glances at Thurman.
MERCER
Where are you staying? Do you have
relatives here?

Viktor reaches into his breast pocket and pulls out an
envelope. He opens it, hands the paper inside to Mercer who
reads it.

MERCER
The Happy Traveler Motel.

A second glance to Thurman.

MERCER
How much money do you have?

Viktor nods.

MERCER
I need to see your money, Mr. Navorski.

Viktor quickly produces three more envelopes, each with
something hand-written on the outside. He offers them to
Mercer. . —

MERCER

MERCER
Please count the & LG mark down the
amount on the piece o ronext to
you.

Mercer and Thurman watch as Viktor slowly counts out the
bills, marking down the amount on the piece of paper as
instructed.

Mercer notices the handwriting on the outside of the first
envelope -

MERCER
(re : the writing)
What does that mean?
Viktor translates -

VIKTOR
Hotel.

Mercer gestures for Viktor to take out the money in the second
envelope. Viktor does, marks the amount down.

MERCER
What about that money? What's that for?

VIKTOR
Food. For food.

viktor opens the final envelope, retrieves a Single bill.
Mercer looks at him -

VIKTOR
Entertainment.

MERCER
(looking at the bill, then
at Thurm: a)
Entertainment?

Viktor nods, writes the denomination down, the third number
on his piece of paper. Mercer gestures for the paper. Viktor
slides it across the table.

Thurman enters the numbers into a calculator and makes the
conversion into dollars. He shows Mercer the amount. Mercer
nods. .

(gesturingéo )
Now your returr ét please.

°
viktor hands it over. Mercer thorough examination,
casually slips Viktor's ticket mn official file and
seals it.

VIKTOR
That's mine -

MERCER
It's just procedure, Mr. Navorski.
(indicating the door Thurman
holds open behind him)
If you wouldn't mind waiting in the
waiting room.

Viktor stares back at him.

MERCER
This really won't take long.

Viktor reluctantly walks through.
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Sterile in here, a single row of seats, a water dispenser,
no windows. A second door indicates a restroom beyond.

Viktor takes off his coat, folds it neatly across one of the
chairs and sits down. He looks around, taking in his bland
surroundings. His fingers tap nervously on the table.

INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

Viktor's expression is grim. His tie is off and his shirt is
unbuttoned. It's clear some hours have passed.

Viktor approaches the door, hesitates...knocks. No answer.
He knocks again.

iventually, Thurman appears turcugh a window on the door.
THURMAN
(a smile)
Be patient, Mr. Navorski.
The window slams shut. - tee
Viktor just stands there for a moment.

INT. WAITING ROOM - LAT

The door suddenly OPENS « thrusts a SANDWICH and a
glass of WATER on a tray iktor's hands.

°
VIKTOR
(still getting w Ye
Thank you very much. CD

Viktor sits down, rips the Saran and bites into his tuna
salad sandwich. He relishes every single mouthful.

INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

Yawning, Viktor cleans stains off his topcoat with the Saran
from the sandwich. He's so exhausted he nearly falls asleep
doing it.

He shakes himself awake, returns to the door, knocking on it
more insistently this time. Nothing. He knocks again.

Silence.
Resigned to his situation at least for the moment, Viktor
returns to his seat and fashions his coat into a pillow.
However the chair back ish't high enough and the 'pillow'
slips down causing Viktor's head to tilt forward awkwardly
to accommodate it.

Laying the pillow on the armrest now, Viktor attempts to
squeeze his whole body sideways into the chair. It's an
impossible contortion.

Exasperated, he sits back in the chair again and tries every
other imaginable position, each less successful than the
last. .

A SHOE

prods at the sleeping Viktor. He is on the floor, his top
coat cver him.

The shoe belongs to -

MERCER
He looks down on the extremely haggard Viktor, Thurman beside
him.

Viktor gets up to sit di @ chair. He notices his suit's

VIKTOR
I don't understand -

MERCER
While you were in the air, your country
was invaded.

A beat. Viktor, in shock.

VIKTOR
..- What?

” MERCER
Fortunately, no resistance was offered.
There were no casualties.
Viktor’

gs shock turns to bewilderment.

VIKTOR
Invaded? Who?

MERCER
I'm sorry.
(getting up to go)
As soon as we have any information, Mr.
Navorski, you'll be the first to know.

Rising out of his chair -

VIKTOR
I am going back.

MERCER
Well, that's the problem I'm afraid, Mr.
Navorski. I can't send you back just
yet. The new Government has sealed the
borders for the time-being.

VIKTOR
So I must wait in New York -- -

enter the Uni} tates at this time

MERCER
Not a valid one, Mr. Navorski. Technically
at least, the country that issued this
passport...

brandishing it)

VIKTOR
So, what you are telling me is...I cannot
go... :

MERCER
No.

VIKTOR
...and I cannot stay.

MERCER
No.

Not for the moment.

A beat. Viktor's brain struggles to put all of this together.

MERCER
I'm going to allow you to get your luggage
and authorize you to enter the
International Transit Lounge. Please
wait there until the situation is
resolved.

Mercer indicates to Thurman to please take Viktor away.
MERCER
I assure you, everything will be cleared
up very soon, Mr. Navorski.

Viktor is numb. - —

Viktor, escorted by Thi and another OFFICIAL, picks his
single BLACK SUITCASE few unclaimed cases sitting
between carousels six si -

Longingly, Viktor watches te Ba 3 at the far end opening
and closing, offering momenta: impses of the bustling
Terminal beyond and signs indi’ ground transportation
into the city.

On the other side of the hall, MULROY - 30s, biack, wearing
dirty overalls and ripped gloves.- loads his cart with lost
bags.

He notices Viktor being escorted back up the steps to the
secured waiting area.

INT. WAITING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

HANDS roughly go through the few simple items in Viktor's
bagd...socks...a pair of shoes...plain shirts and ties...a
toiletries case... :

An ALSATIAN DOG sniffs every inch of the bag. The HANDLER
pulls the dog off.
ii.

The Dog licks Viktor's hand, which just for an instant, causes
the handler pause before he pulis his dog back out the door.

Thurman zips up Viktor's bag, hands it back to him.

VIKTOR
Thank you.

Viktor, smiling, pulls out the envelope with his hotel details
inside.

VIKTOR
Now, can you please tell me where to get
the bus for Manhattan?

A beat. Thurman half-smiles, glancing to his colleague.

THURMAN
I don't think you fully comprehended
what Mr. Mercer said, Mr. Navorski. You
have to wait.

As Thurman points up to the cameras everywhere -

THURMAN
Any attempt to pass through those doors
or to enter the United States through

immediate arrest and confinement in the
Detention Ceuter.

Viktor's hand is trembling with fear.

INT. OBSERVATION DECK - LATER

Mercer and Thurman observe Viktor from the mezzanine floor
above.

VIKTOR
sits on a seat very near the door. his single case on his

knees, his hands resting on the case. He watches the imnortant
doors in the distance and the cameras everywhere.

Mercer and Thurman notice Viktor as they finish up coffees
on their break.

THURMAN
He's been sitting there for three hours.
MERCER
Do you know how big it is, this country

ARRIVALS/DEPARTURES BOARD

Flight information flickers...
Bahrain...Lima...Brussels...Tangier

VIKTOR

stands amidst a group of late-night TRAVELLERS staring up at
the Arrivals/Departures board, looking very lost and alone.

As flights are cancelled, delayed or given the go-ahead to
board, groups of passengers arrive and depart. The only
constant is Viktor.

He turns around again, confused, unsure of which direction
to take.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMIVJAL, UPPER SHOPPING CONCOURSE-LATER

over his freshly-mopped floor, seemingly oblivious or
indifferent to the fact that in a few seconds it will be

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - DAY

Having finally exhausted his exploration of the upper levels,
Viktor is faced with a stained plastic curtain at the end of
a long concourse.

A sign apologizes - "Please Excuse Our Appearance During
Construction of Our New Wing"

Viktor sneaks a look behind the curtain - WORKMEN, overseen
by their foreman KARL IVERSON, are constructing a new
concourse including dozens of additional gates.

Viktor studies the workmen, fascinated, gazing towards central
area between the distant cluster of gates - a large cavity

in the ground indicating where foundations have yet to be
laid.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TRANSIT UOUNGE, FOOD COURT AREA - DAY
The food vouchers in his hand, Viktor moves excitedly past a
dizzying array of food concession stands. This is the United
Nations of cuisine.

His attention is suddenly drawn to a frailYOUNG WOMAN sitting

INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNGE AREA - NEXT DAY

Viktor walks the plush-carpeted corridor that links all the
first class lounges.

Outside the Alitalia lounge Viktor hears the POP of a
champagne cork. He jumps, slightly unnerved.

Viktor moves through the glass doors but as they slide open
for him a frosty-looking HOSTESS - smoking her Muratti
Ambassadori with surprising aggression - stops him.
HOSTESS

Viktor shakes his head, no, and moves on.

Viktor stands at the LOCKED DOORS to the Immigration area.
He sighs.

The Woman backs away, scared. Viktor walks towards his bag,
the only piece of luggage revolving on the carousel.

Mulroy, loading a cart with heavy flight cases, sees Viktor
coming. He watches as Viktor pulls his bag off the carousel,
retrieves his toothbrush and puts the bag back on.

Straightening, Viktor notices Mulroy staring at him.

As Viktor's bag revolves around towards Mulroy, Mulroy lifts
it off the carousel and drops it by his feet.

A bizarre kind of Mexican stand-off as Viktor and Mulroy
stare at each other.

Viktor finally walks to Mulroy, picks up his bag and places

it back on the carousel. Mulroy walks around Viktor and
casually takes it off. Viktor walks around Mulroy and casually
puts it back on.

Mulroy waves his hand, !enough'. He stomps over to a nearby
panel, flicks a switch and the carousel STOPS...Viktor's bag
is just sitting there...

Viktor looks at him, finally picks up his bag. Mulroy exits,
his trolley in tow.

VIKTOR
Sorry.

INT. TERMINAL, NEW WING - NIGHT

Viktor, carrying his bag and looking tired, walks past the
gates under construction that seem to stretch off into
infinity...38...39...40...41

The higher the gate number, the greater the evidence of
construction work - scaffolding, painting equipment,
electrical drilis, heavy tools.

Viktor stops at the last one.
GATE 5C

He smiles and walks inside. It is virtually a shell apart
from random pieces of old equipment - seats, gate desks etc. -
about to be taken away. Paint cans and ladders everywhere.

Tucked away in the far corner there's a little row of plastic
and metal seats with armrests.

Viktor walks over, sits down, fashions his coat into a pillow
again to get some rest...He tries the ‘pillow' in every
imaginable position, each less successful than the last.

INT. IMMIGRATION WAITING ROOM - MORNING ~
Viktor walks up to the netew, holding his badly cricked
neck. An Immigration 4 OFFICER TORRES, is already

Viktor smiles, offering his Coe

VIKTOR

Staring at him all the time, Officer Torres casually places
a small placard between them which reads ‘Back in half an

VIKTOR
Hello? Hello?

Viktor stands in a long line waiting. After a while he .saches
the front.

VIKTOR

The female Officer, busy with paperwork, doesn't look at him -

OFFICER
Mr. Mercer is busy right now, sir.

VIKTOR
I am Viktor Navorski. I must talk to --

OFFICER
-- Any questions you have can be taken
care of at Window Nineteen.
She points to a huge line across the hall.

Waits patiently in the long line. Finally he reaches the
front. Officer Torres looks at him.

Viktor hands over his passport.

OFFICER TORRES

form.

VIKTOR
Where do I get the green form?

He looks Viktor over.

OFFICER TORRES
Not here. Next!

Viktor finally reaches the front of the line.

Just as he approaches the window with his passport and filled-
out Green form, Officer Torres CLOSES the window.

VIKTOR
No. Please!

Viktor waits with his case on his knees, his hands over his

up ahead in the distance distracts them -

TWO YOUNG CHINESE MEN

make a run for it through Passport control. The Men manage
to make it through the doors and RUSH the Baggage Claim area,
KNOCKING PASSENGERS over as they struggle to find a way out.

VIKTOR

watches, rapt, as the Men near him and Mercer, pursued by a
dozen

The Men turn, stopping only when they see
MORE OFFICERS
waiting for them at the other end.
Cornered, they jump onto a carousel, scrambling desperately
over bags to get to the opening above where they're coming
from.

Vaktor's with their every move.

The Officers jump on the carousels now too, grabbing the men
by their legs, pulling off their shoes...

As the Officers hustle the illegals towards the Security
doors at the far end, one of the prisoners starts to cry.

VIKTOR
watches, frightened.

Mercer gestures to Thurman who's nearby. He whispers something
into Thurman's ear, walks out past Viktor.

THURMAN
Come with me, Mr. Navorski.

Viktor, panicked, watches Mercer go, worried he may finally
have pushed Mercer too far.

INT. IMMIGRATION AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Thurman leads Viktor down another corridor. Viktor is clearly
terrified something awful is about to happen. Thurman opens
a door onto a huge hall which looks down onto the baggage
claim area below.

THURMAN

Viktor walks toward the far end, ee down through the glass
at the crush of passengers trying find their bags.

Bt the phone, Viktor looks back and sees Thurman still
watching him. He forces a smile.

He picks up the receiver and dials the number.

Mulroy watches.

Shaking his head again at "these kind of people’, Mulroy
puts his gloves back on and resumes working, grabbing bags

off the packed carousel and lining them up -on.the floor.

After a while Mulroy looks up again but, Viktor's gone...the

Viktor sits on the seats and stares out at the runways. An

into the starry winter sky.

He looks at his watch. It's just after eleven-thirty.

He sighs deeply, waiting...and waiting...He looks around the
gate. Nothing. Not a sound.

Viktor can't escape it, he knows he could be here literally
forever.

Viktor reaches into his pocket, pulls out

THE FEW COINS

from his homeland still in his pocket.

A sad look on nis face. He takes one of them, examines it...an
idea hits him. He ducks underneath the seats and uses the

edge of the coin to remove a screw

MOMENTS LATER

A pile of screws on she floor, all of the ARMRESTS on the
row of seats detached.

Now he uses the coin to make TWO GROOVES in the wall, one

for each day he's been here.

Viktor lies down on his new 'bed'. A sigh of deep satisfaction
as he reaches down to make Sure his BAG is still right beside
him on the floor.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL, ARRIVALS GATE ~- NIGHT

Viktor watches through the ‘glass as FAMILIES are re-united
with their loved ones arriving off long-haul flights -
An elderly WOMAN (60s) hugs her slightly younger SISTER.
They cry tears of joy. It's been a long time since they saw
each other.

A small BLACK kid, perhaps nine or ten, jumps into his
FATEER's arms as he runs out the gate with his beaming MOTHER.

A blonde GIRL runs into her boyfriend's arms. He lifts her
up, her legs wrapping around his waist as they kiss
passionately without even saying hello.

A CRASHING sound -

VOICE (0.S.)
Shit.

Viktor turns to see a young FLIGHT ATTENDANT - Hispanic,
30s, no-make-up - arms and legs akimbo, lying on the floor
not far from him, the contents of her bag spread out all
over the place.

She realizes her heel's broken, curses to herself in Spanish

Gupta just stares at him...then offers Viktor the mop.

VIKTOR
No, thank you.

Gupta's accent is Pukkah-British -

GUPTA

Intrigued by the friendliness of his contempt, Viktor stays
where he is, watches Gupta mopping.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TRANSIT LOUNGE, GATE THIRTY - NIGHT

En route to "bed', Viktor slows at Gate Thirty, noting the
stacked cans of PAINT under plastic. He looks around to check
the coast is clear.

Viktor peels the plastic back to get a better look at the
cans. Unused BRUSHES too.

viktor considers the peeling far wall. He takes off his tie,
shirt, jacket and trousers and folds them neatly in a pile.

Without so much as a second thought, Viktor lifts a nearby
LADDER off the ground, flips it up and leans it against the
wall. Using the edge of a large coin, Viktor pops the lid on
the paint, dips one of the brushes in and climbs up the
ladder.

Viktor starts painting. He works carefully and exactly.

The man watches’ as Viktor approaches one of the basins and
spits into it. The Businessman locks at Vikter, disgusted.

Viktor offers a toothpaste-lathered smile as an apology.

he's still famished.

viktor looks up - A FAMILY OF FOUR finishes a dinner of
Chinese food at a nearby table. The YOUNGEST, who's crying,
hasn't even touched his burger and Fries. Viktor stares at
the untouched meal longingly. Finally, the family gets up to
leave.

Viktor rises, instinctively MOVING TOWARD the table when a
BUSBOY appears out of nowhere and scoops up the all the trays -
including the untouched burger - and throws it away. Viktor

boils angrily on a rickety hot plate.

  

INT. TERMINAL - MULROY'S HIDEAWAY

Deep in the bowels of the Baggage handling area, conveyors
and carousels groaning somewhere in the distance.

Mulroy stirs the pot, intermittently singing along to the
Loretta Lynn song coming out of the yellow Binatone stereo
and smoking a matching yellow corn-paper joint as he talks -

to hang a shower curtain.

MULROY

They're not like normal women, Viktor.
They're some kind cf separate breed.
Flying back and forth across all those
time zones screws with their hormones.
Girls just shouldn't be up that high
that long. It's unnatural. Trust me,
unless you're just in the market for a
little fun, stay away, man.

Mulroy turns round with a taste on the end of a large cooking
spoon for Viktor -

MULROY

A bang at the door. Enrique appears, wheeling a labrador
under a blanket (SCOUT) on a make-shift trolleybehind him.

He hugs Mulroy, looks at Viktor.

ENRIQUE
The man with no country.

Enrique reaches down, pulls out a couple of bottles of DOM

VIKTOR
You stole them?

Enrique feigns shock.

ENRIQUE
My God.
(mockingly, to Mulroy)
I stole them.

Enrique cackles as he pops the cork. Viktor's in no mood to
celebrate. He reaches down to Scout who licks his hand.

INT. MULROY' S HIDEAWAY - LATER

The room is filled with thick Marijuana smoke from the
superbong. The champagne bottles are empty too. Viktor looks
uncomfortable, almost like he wants to leave but is frightened
to excuse himself.

He reaches down to pe g again, noting the braces on
both his hind legs this «ime

SCOUT - IN FLASHBACK

Sniffing vigorously, his crippled legs dangling uselessly
from a luggage cart is wheeled slowly past a mountain of
BAGS by Mulroy. A furtive Enrique trails, making sure the
coast is clear...

MULROY (V.0.) ~
We wheel him past the bags before the
first team dogs go in.
Scout starts to sniff and grab at a back pack. Mulroy opens
it, pulls out a small CUCINA DOLL inside, puts it in front
of Scout's nose. He barks. Mulroy twists off the doll's head,
looks inside, then up at Enrique...Bingo.

INT. MULROY'S HIDEAWAY - CONTINUOUS

Viktor watches as Enrique reaches down to the barrel hanging
off Scout's collar and pulls out two large bags of weed.

ENRIQUE

EXT/ INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINI ENANCE ROOM - LATER

In a good mood, Viktor walks past one of the maintenance
rooms, hears the noise of a FIGHT, enters.

A pair of CLEANERS, their mops raised, spar viciously with
each other while other CLEANERS surround them, egging them
on.

As Viktor gets closer he realizes one of the cleaners is
Gupta.

VIKTOR
What is happening here?
CLEANER
An old grudge. Ancient rivals from
neighboring villages -- back in their
homeland.

The two men fight viciously.
‘ CLEANER
The wound was re-opened because Gupta
went to the movies with Sanjay's
girlfriend, Pria.

Viktor steps forward, moving very close to them. He clears
his throat. The cleaners don't even notice him.

Viktor clears his throat again, LOUDLY this time.

Still, the cleaners go at it with their mops like crazed
cocks, oblivious.

Finally, and very loudly -

- VIKTOR
GENTLEMEN. STOP!...Please.

Everyone, including the fighting cleaners, freezes, stunned
by Viktor's -uncharacterifgic outburst.

  
  

This is the intéymational Transit lounge.
This is a neutral ong> Whatever
differences you may in the outside

Viktor gently takes their mops, them into their buckets

Karl, Daniels, Gupta, Larabee, Pierre. Assorted other airport
WORKERS, ticketing PEOPLE and Immigration SECRETARIES milling

saying 'Bon Voyage' .
People come up and congratulate Viktor. He shakes hands and
smiles...but there's something about his expression that's
off.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

Mercer breaks the seal on Viktor's file, hands back his
ticket.

MERCER

Viktor sees him coming, hides...

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL, CONCOURSE/WING - LATE AT NIGHT

Mulroy ducks behind the curtain to the new wing. He stops at
the sight of -

VIKTOR

in his work overalls, carefully applying finishing touches
to the second tier of his fountain.

Mulroy just studies Viktor froma distance for a moment.
Sensing someone's there, >¥iktor turns, spots Mulroy making
his way over to him, regi to his work.

A beat.

MULR °

Viktor doesn’t answer, gestures for Mulroy to please hand
him a fresh can of sealant. He does.

MULROY
I don't understand you, Viktor.

A beat. Mulroy closes in, trying to make Viktor face him.

MULROY
What about your family? Have you thought
about them? .
Viktor calmly continues with his work, expertly coating the
underside of a tricky corner.

MULROY
Maybe they miss you, Viktor.

viktor still won't respond or look at him.

MULROY

Because I know you miss them.
VIKTOR

No.
MULROY

Look, man, I saw you when you first
arrived. You called them. I saw you

Finally, Viktor's eyes meet his.

It doesn't make sense, Viktor.

Viktor steps down from the tier, screws the cap back on the
sealant.

When Viktor speaks now, it is from another place -

VIKTOF
I was a builder in my hometown. I was
commissioned to build a new school. People
trusted me. The whole town trusted me.
Everyone felt I was the only man for the
job. I was honored. We started work but

Viktor's expression, haunted by the memory.

VIKTOR
I went to her family's house and saw her
body. She stared at me...and stared at
me. I tried to explain...but nothing was
the same after that.

Viktor bows his head. A long beat.
VIKTOR
When I arrived here, I knew I was never
going back.

Mulroy looks at Viktor, at the fountain he's building...it's
all starting to make sense.

INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL, NEW WING - DAWN
The morning begins to glow over the runways.
Viktor, alone, looks out across them, his eyes heavy. He
turns to his fountain. There's no more he can do. He just

hopes it's good enough...

He walks back over to it, and taking his chisel, very
discreetly engraves a name into the scroll work...

An agitated Viktor rushes around the corner. We see the

pushes to the front, offering d to Viktor.
A nod of acknowledgement to Vik: fountain -

From behind his back, he produces A BOX with a bow around

Inside there's a pair of new white work overalls with 'VIKTOR'
embroidered over the breast pocket.

The driver of the cleaning vehicle jumps out, ducks into a
restroom nearby.

The loud. PA announcement of the flight's arrival breaks
Viktor's reverie.

He starts on his way again.

Passing the cleaning vehicle, he pauses, half-glimpsing
something in one of the open bags of rubbish collected from
the runways. He moves closer, uncertain...

As he nears it, its form becomes more distinct --

A MANGLED PAPER AIRPLANE
It's the plane he made for Amelia, the one she threw off the
Observation Deck.

Viktor pulls it out, wipes off the dirt, examines it.
A beat.

Viktor's eyes are dark, his expression broken.

viktor works without feeling, and by the absent look on his
face, seemingly without consciousness either.

On Viktor's BRUSH again as it slowly crosses the border over
onto the adjoining wall and absently paints a messy CROOKED
LINE across it.

viktor puts his brush back into the paint, moves the can
over to start work on the next section. One of the Puerto
Ricans working nearby notices the crooked line on the wall -

Hesitating at the top of the escalator a moment, Mulroy
watches Viktor pass the Main PARTITION DOORS to his left,

signs for the New Wing's RESTRICTED SECURITY AREA guarded by
two IMMIGRATION OFFICERS.

Viktor's heading straight towards the Security Area at the
far end. Mulroy passes Gupta now too, following Viktor,
gesturing towards

Viktor's holding in his hand -

Gupta spots it, shrugs to Mulroy as if to ask 'What the hell's
goin, on?' Mulroy shrugs back, he hasn't a clue, gesturing
for Gupta to follow him...

unflinching resolve in his eye.

Mulroy catches up to Viktor now...
