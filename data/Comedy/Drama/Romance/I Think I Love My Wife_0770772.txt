Here’s to those whom we’d love, if only we dared.”
02.15.06 - ITILMW 2.

INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

We have entered the home of RICHARD AND ERICA COOPER. The

place LOOKS very Norman Rockwell. PICTURES are on the mantel
and ESSENCE MAGAZINES on the coffee table. RICHARD, 38, is

an investment banker. He is married to ERICA, 36, a high *
school English teacher. She’s six months pregnant. *

INT. HALLWAY BETWEEN BEDROOMS ~ MORNING

We hear their DAUGHTER, KELLY, crying in one of the rooms.
Richard comes out of the master bedroom and stands in the
doorway of Kelly’s room. He is tying his tie in a hurry.
“Good Morning America” is on the T.V.

RICHARD
Shh... shh... Daddy loves you.
Mommy will be right there.

She stops crying. He goes back into his room. The instant
he leaves the doorway, the crying starts again. He runs out
again, sticks his head back in her room, now pulling on his
shoes.

RICHARD
Come on now, baby. Mama’s coming.
Shhh. Daddy loves you.

She stops. He repeats this a few times. Each time he *
leaves, she cries instantly and each time he reappears he is
closer to being ready for work. Finally, fully clothed, he
gets the baby out of the room and walks to the bathroom *
holding her.

*

RICHARD
Who’s my baby? Kelly’s my baby.
You love your daddy?

He knocks on the bathroom door. We can HEAR the shower
running.

RICHARD *
Erica... Erica. *

ERICA (0.S.)
Yeah, come in.

He opens the bathroom door and we see Erica’s beautiful naked
back as she wraps a towel around herself and starts to dry
off.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 3.

RICHARD
Here, can you take her? I gotta
get outta here.

ERICA
I got her.

Erica takes the baby. Richard kisses her.

ERICA *
You better stop. You’re gonna get *
wet.

RICHARD

It’s okay, I have my raincoat on.

They kiss.

ERICA
Call me if you’re going to be late.

RICHARD
I will.

 

As he walks away from her, he looks back. We are seeing a
beauty shot of Erica smiling holding the baby. The perfect
wife. The CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER VERY SLOWLY.

RICHARD (V.0.)
Hi, I’m Richard Cooper. I’ve been
married for seven years and I’m
bored out of my fucking mind. 8

INT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S HOUSE - DAY

Erica is now playing with their daughter in her playroom.
Both are on the floor.

RICHARD (V.0O.) *
And that’s my wife, Erica. She is
the last. She’s the last woman
I’ve ever taken on vacation, the
last woman I ever took out to
dinner, the last woman I ever had
sex with and, by the way, like a
lot of married couples, we don’t
have sex -- correction, we don’t
fuck. Oh, we have intercourse less
than eight. times a year, but wé
never fuck.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 4.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

Richard and Erica are in bed. Richard makes a move to touch
her.

ERICA
Honey, I don’t want to do anything.
I’ve got a headache.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FLASHBACK
Another day in bed.

ERICA
Please don’t touch me. My hair
hurts.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FLASHBACK
Another day in bed.

ERICA
What are you doing?!

INT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S HOUSE - FLASHBACK

RICHARD (V.O.)
I went though the same thing every
married man does: I married my
wife, she had kids and went nuts.

ERICA
I want another baby.

RICHARD
What are you talking about? You’re
having a baby.

ERICA
Yeah, but I’m ready for another
one.

RICHARD (V.O.)
But we worked it out. We went to
couples therapy and I got my ass
kicked by both of them.

INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - FLASHBACK

A pregnant Erica is crying as the therapist writes on a pad
and gives Richard (who we don’t see) disapproving looks.

ERICA
He doesn’t listen to me. It’s like
I’m not even there. We're two
strangers living in a house.

ANGLE ON: Richard with bandages on his face, a black eye and
a fat lip.

RICHARD
I’m sorry.

RICHARD (V.0O.)
Most men would go out and cheat.
But here’s what happened when she
thought I was cheating.

INT. LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK

The house is dark. Richard makes his way to the stairs
quietly. Suddenly we hear a punch land, Richard falls.

RICHARD
Hey! What’s going on?

ERICA
Mutherfucker,. you didn’t think I
was going to find out?

RICHARD
Ow! My eye! You’ve got it all
wrong, baby!

ERICA
Tell that to your bitch!
INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY
Erica is adjusting Richard’s tie. She gives Richard a kiss.
RICHARD (V.O.)
But now everything's okay... it’s

just that I’m bored out of my mind.

RICHARD
I love you.

Richard turns to go, but Erica pulls him back by the tie.

ERICA
I love you, too. Oh, after work *
pick up two boxes of pampers. *

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - LATER

Richard sits among OTHER PASSENGERS on his daily commute to
work. He opens his briefcase, pulls out a newspaper and an
iPod. He puts the headphones on and presses a button. He
plays some Wu Tang Clan and starts reading the New York
Times.

Richard looks around at the WOMEN in his car.

RICHARD (V.0.) *
So our marriage was normal, which *
meant I wasn’t getting laid. *

A pretty girl stands holding a pole. To Richard it appears
to be more seductive than it is.

RICHARD (V.O.)
Now what I don’t understand is, how
can my wife not have sex with me
and then send me out into a world
with so many beautiful women? I’ve *
always liked looking at women, but
now I stare at them like a damn
psycho. I have to do everything I *
can to resist them. *

The camera PANS to another BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN putting on
her lipstick.

RICHARD (V.O.)
Oh yes, look at her. Put on that
lipstick, baby. Oh yes, put it on.

ANGLE ON: a BLONDE WOMAN on her cell-phone.

RICHARD (V.0O.)
Look at her on the phone. Yes,
dial those numbers. Let me see you
talk. Yeah, say something dirty.
What’s wrong with me?

ANGLE ON: a SPANISH WOMAN reading the paper.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 7.

RICHARD (V.0.)
What about her? Turn that page.
Yes, that’s nice. Read baby.
Yeah, read for daddy. That’s it.
Maybe I should just drive to work.

CUT TO:

EXT. TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORK - A LITTLE LATER

The morning COMMUTERS bustle through the streets on their way
to work.

RICHARD (V.O.)
I don’t really like living in New
Jersey. It’s so boring, but that’s
what Erica wants. You know how
that goes. I LOVE Manhattan. I
love the flow of the crowd. I love
the mix of people.

EXT. MIDTOWN - LATER
Richard in midtown. He is moving in the throng.

RICHARD (V.O.)
I love that-- oh shit!

We see SIX BLACK AND PUERTO RICAN THUGS walking down the
street toward Richard.

RICHARD (V.O.)
Let me get my ass across the
street.

Richard crosses the street. The thugs pass by. All is well.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Richard walks through the busy lobby toward the elevator. He
stands waiting for the elevator.

RICHARD (V.0O.)
I work as an investment banker at a
place called “The Gotham Asset
Company.” I‘m one of the only
blacks at the firm.

(MORE)
02.15.06 - ITILMW 8.

RICHARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
As a matter of fact, there are so
few here that I think I know every
black person in the building.

Good morning, Richard.

CUT TO:

INT. NEWSSTAND IN THE OFFICE BUILDING - SAME

Richard buys a Kit Kat at the newsstand. The elevator comes
and Richard boards.

RICHARD (V.0.)
It’s not that bad. Everybody here
treats me pretty good, but I have
to admit, being one of the only
blacks here makes me a little
paranoid, but I guess I’m okay.

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Richard enters the open multi-cubicle area of this financial
office and walks through the EMPTY bullpen. He stops at his
mail slot. He glances through some mail. He puts his
raincoat and briefcase down and starts using a computer.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 9.

As he types, he unwraps the Kit-Kat bar, cracks off half of
it, leaving the other half on the desk. Just then ONE of TWO
SECRETARIES, TRACY, arrives. TRACY is a 26 YEAR OLD, PRETTY,
DARK-HAIRED WHITE WOMAN. She’s dressed very professionally.
It’s all business between these two.

TRACY
Morning, am I late?

RICHARD
No, I’m early. I'11 get off this
in a second.

She hangs up her coat. Richard goes over to the printer and
removes the printout, reading it. He then goes into HIS
OFFICE, which is private.

INT. RICHARD’S PRIVATE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A nicely appointed office. .A DEGREE or TWO hang on the wall,
FAMILY PHOTOS, ETC. Not a huge office but it has a great
view. of midtown. Richard does some quiet work. He is really
concentrating. e

EXTREME CLOSE UP SEQUENCE: WORKING

A series of quiet (no music), extreme close ups showing:
RICHARD’S PEN as he writes on a report.

RICHARD’S EYES as he reads a flow chart (wearing glasses?).

RICHARD’S FINGER as he traces a line down a very dense sheet
of stock figures. We see he wears a gold class ring. He
traces down the stock codes next to their current value until
he settles on a single figure and taps it once.

RICHARD
(whispering)
There you are.

Richard highlights the figure and rips the sheet out, going
back out his office door.

INT. OFFICE —- CONTINUOUS

Richard opens the door onto a now BUSY office. Everyone is
arriving at work.

RICHARD (cont'd)
Tracy, this is what we’re doing
today. Where’s George?

GEORGE, Richard’s colleague, a well dressed bespectacled
WHITE MAN, and MARY, the other receptionist who is exactly
like Tracy but HISPANIC, walk up the bullpen aisle, talking
loudly until they reach George’s private office which is next
to Richard's.

MARY
Why is there always a track-fire?
Every morning I’m sitting on a
train waiting for a track fire.

RICHARD
c'mon, Mary. They tell you it’s a
track fire because they don’t want
to say rat stampede.

TRACY
George, your wife is on the phone
and Veronica called.

GEORGE
Okay, call back Veronica and tell
my wife I'll call her later.
(to Richard)
Rich, you want to go over that
stuff before Landis gets in?

Just then, MR. LANDIS, the boss walks in. Landis is a 55
YEAR OLD WHITE MAN, a Gene Hackman type.

MR. LANDIS
Too late. I’m here. ‘Morning
everyone. Cooper, can you bring
those contracts to my office ASAP?

RICHARD
No problem. I’11l get them right
now.
MR. LANDIS
Tracy, send somebody to Starbucks.
TRACY
It’s already done.
MR. LANDIS
Alright. Let’s get to work,

people.

INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE - LATER
George pops his head in the doorway.

GEORGE

Had to ask. Who knows, you might
just say “yes” one day.

EXT. MIDTOWN — DAY
We see PEOPLE in line at a chicken/pita stand, a line going

02.15.06 - ITILMW 12.

RICHARD (V.O.)
They say New York is the city that
never sleeps, and it’s true, but
what they don’t say is that every
day around three PM, after lunch
New York takes a little nap and
that’s when I like to get out of
the office.

He looks further. An average looking SALESWOMAN approaches
him.

SALESWOMAN
Have you seen the new Prada suits?

RICHARD
No thanks. I’m just looking.

A GAY SALESMAN approaches, not over the top but still gay,
comes over with cologne.

GAY SALESMAN
Excuse me, sir, would you like to
try the new fragrance from Calvin
Klein?

RICHARD
No, that’s okay.

He follows Richard and sprays a little in the air.

RICHARD
(referring to a shirt)
Yeah, do you have this in blue?
She picks up a green shirt and holds it up to his body.

We see Richard in the dressing room, buttoning up his shirt.
The salesgirl walks in before he’s got it buttoned up and is
now sharing the tight space with him.

SALESGIRL
That looks great on you.

RICHARD
Really? You think so?

SALESGIRL
It’s sexy. I like it.

Richard looks again.

RICHARD
I don’t know. I don’t normally
wear stuff like this.

SALESGIRL
You should start. You look really
handsome in it. Hey, Lisa...

The Asian salesgirl draws back the curtain. A beautiful
BLACK SALESGIRL, LISA, joins them in the dressing room which
is now even more cramped. Lisa looks him up and down. Both
girls are standing very close to him and staring at him in
the mirror.

RICHARD
(looking in the mirror)
You think so?

BOTH SALESGIRLS
Yes, very handsome.

Just then the gay salesman that was trying to sell the
cologne sticks his head in the dressing room.

GAY SALESMAN

Give her a break. She’s only two.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 16.

RICHARD
So what? There’re white kids her
age taking the bar exam. She's

RICHARD
Hey, Kelly! Look out! Turtle-

Kelly laughs. Erica laughs.

INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A very BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN has her back turned to us.
She’s smoking a cigarette and WEARING super-tight low riding
SEVEN jeans over her perfect-stop-traffic ass, a red PRADA
top over stop-air-traffic tits and MANOLO BLAHNIK shoes on
her perfect feet. She turns around in SLOW MOTION and we
meet NIKKI.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 17.

RICHARD
Damn.
NIKKI
I knew you wouldn’t recognize me.
RICHARD
Nikki?
NIKKI

What? Did you think I was dead?

Richard puts his stuff down, settling into his office and
tries to act like he’s not affected by her.

RICHARD
I don’t know. I wasn’t really
thinking about you.

She takes a slow drag off her cigarette, smiling.

RICHARD
You know, people don’t smoke in
offices anymore.

He goes over and opens a window.

NIKKI
You don’t seem happy to see me.

RICHARD
No, hey. I’m happy to see you.

He gives her a quick, uncomfortable hug, then moves away.

RICHARD
So, what brings you here?

NIKKI
I came to see you. I just bumped
into Simon at Starbucks and he told
me you worked here, so I figured
I’d come up and say hi.

RICHARD
How’s Simon doing? He owes me a
call?

NIKKI
He’s alright. Just got out-of
rehab.

NIKKI (cont'd)
Look at you. You’re a big man *
here?

RICHARD
Not really. I have a few people I
have to answer to, but I’m not
complaining. They take good care
of me.

Richard takes his daily Kit-Kat out of his pocket, cracks off
half and starts eating it, leaving the rest on his desk and
leans back in his chair. Nikki sees pictures of Richard's
family on his desk.

NIKKI
Are you married?

RICHARD
Yes, for seven years. That’s my
daughter, Kelly, she’s two and
that’s my wife, Erica. We have
another baby on the way.

NIKKI *
Really? You? You got married? *
You walked down the aisle? You *
said "I do”? Are you happily *
married? *

He looks at her for beat.

RICHARD
Uhh yeah... I’m happily married.

NIKKI
Really, I don’t know. You didn’t
say it right.

RICHARD
Really? How should I have said it?

NIKKI
I know you shouldn’t have had to
think about it. I hear ice
cracking.

RICHARD
What?

NIKKI
When I was in Boston College I used *
to walk across the Charles River to *
get to school. *

02.15.06 - ITILMW 19.

NIKKI (cont'd)
You ever walk across a frozen river *
and hear ice cracking? That’s the *
scariest sound in the world.

RICHARD
Don’t worry, my ice is fine. You
married?

NIKKI

Me married? Hell no!
Phone RINGS. Richard answers it.

RICHARD
(to Nikki)
Excuse me.
(into phone)
Hello?... Yeah, come right now.
I’m not doing anything.

He hangs up the phone.

NIKKI
Am I in the way?
RICHARD
No, you're okay. So what are you
doing with yourself?

Nikki sits on his desk, picking up the other half of the Kit-
Kat and eats it.

NIKKI
Nothing great. I work at the Blue
Bar. You know, right next to
Nell’s.

RICHARD
Next to Nell’s? I don’t think I’ve
been to a club in like six years.

NIKKI
Damn, you really did settle down.
I'd like to settle down, but I
still like to hang out real late.
I-like to have breakfast when
everybody else is eating lunch.

RICHARD
Ooh, what a rebel.

They share an uncomfortable silence.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 20.

RICHARD
Hey, look, sometimes I’m free in
the afternoon. If you call maybe
one day we could have a late lunch.

NIKKI
You don’t want to have lunch with
me. You’re just trying to make up
for being so mean when you walked
in.

RICHARD
No, listen, it would be great to
see you and catch up.

The intercom BUZZES. Richard picks up his phone, now all
business. Nikki sees this and leaves.

RICHARD
Yeah... Okay, let’s go over that
tomorrow...
(to Nikki)

Later, Nikki.

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - EARLY EVENING

Still wearing the green sweater, Richard sits with other
PASSENGERS on his way home. He‘s got his headphones on
listening to Wu Tang Clan.

RICHARD (V.O.)
Seeing Nikki made me realize how
uncomfortable I’d become with
women. I’d like to think that
before I got married I knew how to
talk to women.

INT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY

Richard is walking through Times Square in SLOW MOTION.
PEOPLE pass him by. He’s dressed in an Armani suit, cool
shades and expensive shoes, very slick and rich looking. He
has an intense look on his face. The general atmosphere
tells us this is not reality.

MUSIC: “Excuse Me Miss” by Jay-Z plays.

Through some subtle VISUAL AND SOUND EFFECT, Richard’s body
lights up for a second.

02.15.06 - ITILMW 21.

EXTREME CLOSE UP: Richard’s face. As he begins to exude
sheer confidence.

ANGLE ON: SEVERAL CLOSE UPS of SEVERAL WOMEN, who were
walking by, peering at Richard as they pass him, instantly
falling for him.

ANGLE.ON: RICHARD drinking it in with a deep breath (kind of
like Keanu in the last scene of “the Matrix”).

RICHARD (V.0.)
If I was single I’d be dangerous.

A WOMAN walks by. She seems very busy and successful.

RICHARD
Excuse me, do you want to have sex
with me?

WOMAN ONE

Of course I do.

He leads her off.

INT. TIMES SQUARE - FANTASY

You better bring your ass on.

She pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to him. They leave.

INT. TIMES SQUARE ~ FANTASY
Richard approaches a cute, young girl.

RICHARD
Excuse me, Miss--

She walks off, leaving him standing there.

RICHARD
Maybe it is a good thing I got
married.

INT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Richard walks into the kitchen after a hard day’s work still

busy we were today. First, we went
to music together then she had a
play date at Brian’s house.

RICHARD
Any B-L-A-C-K kids?

ERICA
Not one. I’m thinking about
joining a “Mommy and Me” group in
Teaneck. I gotta figure something

kids here for centuries. Those
Columbine kids weren’t from New

JENNIFER
So let me get this straight--

you’re saying education is
overrated?
02.15.06 - ITILMW 26.

RICHARD
No, I’m saying that school is
overrated. Education is great, but
school teaches kids so many lies.

ERICA
I’m a teacher. I don’t teach kids
lies.

RICHARD

Yes, you do. You know what my
favorite lie that they teach in
school is? The one where they say
that the Indians sold Manhattan for
what was it-- sixteen dollars.

ALLEN
How do you know that was a lie?
Were you there?

RICHARD
Come on, it doesn’t make any sense.
The Indians sold Manhattan for
sixteen dollars? The White man
took everything when he got here
why would he buy Manhattan? That’s
like a rapist asking for a date. I
don’t think so.

RICHARD
What grown man has kids sleeping in

JENIFFER
I admit it’s weird, but it doesn’t
mean he’s guilty.

ERICA
I blame the parents.

RICHARD
I know you think he’s innocent, but
he’1l never baby-sit my kids.

ERICA
Okay, honey you made your point.
You don’t need to scream.

Scream? What are you talking
about? I didn’t scream.

ERICA

Right then the MAITRE’D comes over.

MAITRE’D
How are you doing, gentlemen? Has
everything been satisfactory?

RICHARD
The food was great. We just hada
problem with our service.

MAITRE’D
Really? Did she bring your food on
time? Was she rude?

RICHARD
No, no. Nothing like that. The
service was great, but just look at
her.

MAITRE’D
Jessica?

RICHARD
Yes, Jessica. We came here for a
quiet dinner with our wives. We
don’t need this shit. Do you know
how hard it was to try and not
notice her all night? I couldn’t
even enjoy my food. My wife's
trying to tell me something about
my daughter, next thing I know I
got these big tits asking if I want
an appetizer.

MAITRE'D
I’m very sorry, sir.

RICHARD
The next time I come in here with
my wife you better send the oldest,

gotta go. ‘11 call later, okay?

He hangs up the phone. Nikki walks in.
NIKKI
Hi.
RICHARD

What’s up? How’s your new place?

NIKKI
Small, but I like it. You have
some time? You want to get out of
here?
02.15.06 - ITILMW 51.

RICHARD
Um... sure.

NIKKI
Let's go.

She gets up. He gets up. George sticks his head in.

GEORGE
Hey, partner.
(noticing Nikki)
Oh, hi.

RICHARD
George, you remember Nikki?

GEORGE
Sure. Nikki, hi.

They shake hands.

GEORGE
(to Richard)
You know what, can we talk for just
a second? I need’ to know just a
couple of things before I make this
call.

 

RICHARD
Sure. Nikki, why don’t you wait
outside. I’11 be out in a minute.

. GEORGE
Sorry, I won‘’t keep him long.

NIKKI
No problem.

Nikki leaves. George closes the door and leans on the desk,
looking at Richard severely.

RICHARD
So-

George is concerned.

GEORGE
What-the-fuck are you doing?

RICHARD
What’s wrong?

 
02.15.06 - ITILMW 52.

GEORGE
Do you want to mess up your whole
life? What the fuck is wrong with
you?

RICHARD
I’m gonna try that again. What's
wrong, George?

GEORGE
What’s wrong?! This bitch Nikki.
That’s what’s wrong. I can’t
believe you got this bitch up in
the office everyday.

RICHARD
George. Nikki's just-

GEORGE
You got a kid on the way. You got
a good wife. Are you crazy?

RICHARD
George, slow up. I’m not fucking
her.

GEORGE

She’s fucking you, Richard. She’s
already fucking you. You just
don't know it. I’m telling you...

RICHARD

Okay, first of all, nothing’s going
on. Second of all, how's this
coming from you? You cheat on your
wife all the time. Last year, you
were fucking Tracy and Mary at the
same time and I didn’t say shit to
you.

GEORGE
That’s different. I don’t give a
fuck about any of these bitches I
fuck them, then “Hey, bitch, get
the fuck out. I gotta pick up my
wife.” You on the other hand,
you’re like Captain-Save-A-Ho. You
like to be needed and Nikki knows
it.

RICHARD
I appreciate it, dad, but I’m
alright. She’s a friend.
. 02.15.06 - ITILMW 53.

GEORGE
A friend? Right. She’s gonna fall
man. And when she falls, she’s
gonna land on you.

Richard leaves.

INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

Nikki and Richard are standing. Richard is pensive and
stirred by what George said.

NIKKI
You okay? You seem upset.

RICHARD
You know what, we shouldn’t do this
anymore.

NIKKI
Do what? What are you talking
about?

 

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

RICHARD
Our whole “hanging in the afternoon
lunch” thing. It doesn’t look
good. I think we gotta stop.

NIKKI
Stop what? We’re not doing
anything. Look, I’m not trying to
fuck you.. I’m not trying to fuck
anybody. I just wanna hang out
with my friend.

She holds his hand in-hers. Richard looks into her doe eyes,
sees pain, and it melts him.

RICHARD
I’m your friend. It’s just that I
don’t need any drama.

NIKKI
Then come on, let’s hang. No
drama, I promise. Let’s go
somewhere and just chill.

*

 
02.15.06 - ITILMW 54.

She leads him off, still holding his hand.

RICHARD
You wanna get something to eat.
NIKKI
Not really. Let’s go somewhere
different.
CUT TO:
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER
CUT TO:

INT. CAR SHOW - SAME

They are in a big Convention Center with cars displayed all
over. Richard and Nikki are strolling in the hot car

section.

Porsches, Ferraris, concept cars are glittering at

each display, doors open and velvet ropes around them. There
are HOT GIRLS strolling around, SECURITY GUYS at the cars and
car FANS checking everything out.

RICHARD
I’ve been wanting to come here, but
I’ve just been too busy.

NIKKI
It’s only here for a few more days.

RICHARD
Man, look at these cars.

NIKKI
Look at these girls. I wonder how
much they make.

RICHARD
Wow! Porsche turbo. That’s hot.

They walk over to a Porsche prototype which is heavily

guarded.

NIKKI
My friend, Brad, has one of those.
They’re horrible on gas.

RICHARD
Yeah, but I bet they’re great on
pussy.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 55.

NIKKI
Did you say something?

RICHARD
No. Nothing. Is Brad your new
boyfriend?

NIKKI
No, he likes me, but it ain’t going
to happen. Poor Brad.

Nikki walks over to the car, stepping gracefully over the
velvet rope. ONE of the SECURITY GUARDS sees her. He smiles
and holds the door for her as she slides into the seat. Her
skirt rides up, showing her fine legs.

NIKKI
Come on, Richard. Get in.

Richard walks over and gets in the passenger side.
NIKKI

I love the smell of a new car. You
should get one of these.

 

 

Nikki puts the seat way back and puts her feet up on the
dash.

RICHARD
You know how much I’d have to make,
to buy a car like this? For me to
get a “Porsche,” I gotta buy my
mother a Taurus, my wife a Volvo,
and then maybe I can get a Porsche.
Even then, where does the baby seat.
go in this thing?

NIKKI
Well, I’m gonna get one someday and
you're gonna be old and wish you
had one.

RICHARD
Well, you’re gonna be broke someday
and you’re gonna wish you hadn‘t.
Let’s look at the rest of this
stuff so I can get back to work.

CAR SHOW MONTAGE:

Richard and Nikki having a good time. They sit in different
cars: Ferarris, Nascars, etc.

Erica is playing with the baby. She picks up the phone.

ERICA

Hi, Tracy. Is Richard there?...
No, I tried his cell... Okay.
Well, just let him know I called

Erica hangs up the phone looking slightly concerned.

INT. CAR SHOW - SAME TIME

While Nikki and Richard are sitting side by side in a race
car we see them glance into each other’s eyes, and for the
first time we can see that they have feelings for each other.
Richard opens the door of a new Mustang and the alarm goes
off. Richard and Nikki run.

EXT. STREET —- DAY
Nikki is walking Richard back to the office.

RICHARD
I really had a nice time.

NIKKI
I had a nice time too. I’m gonna
miss you this weekend.

RICHARD
I’m going to miss you, too.

They stop in front of the building and look at each other.
It feels like they might kiss but they don’t for now.

RICHARD
I thought you said “no drama.”

NIKKI
There’s no drama.

RICHARD
Bye, Nikki.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 57.

NIKKI
Bye, have a good weekend.

She kisses him lightly on the lips and leaves. He watches her
walk.away and starts to skip down the street. Frank Sinatra,
“I Got The World On A String” starts to play. We see Richard
give a BUM some money, kiss an OLD LADY then the music stops
and the smile leaves his face. Richard runs right up to the
camera and yells (we don’t hear anything).

EXT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S BACKYARD-- FALL DAY
Richard is pushing Kelly on the swing set as Erica walks up.

ERICA
I called your office yesterday
around three forty-five and nobody
knew where to find you. I called
your cell, no answer. I paged you,
you didn’t page me back.

RICHARD
I was probably getting something to
eat at the deli.

 

ERICA
Well, I called you a -few times.
You should let people know where
you're at and keep your phone on.
What if something was wrong with
Kelly? What if I got hit by a car?

RICHARD
I’m telling you, I went to get
something to eat at the deli.

ERICA
I didn’t say that you didn’t go to
the deli. What’s wrong with you?

RICHARD
Nothing. So what do you want to do
tomorrow? A movie? We could have
brunch with Allen and Jennifer.

ERICA
We always do that. Why don’t we do
something different?

CUT TO:
02.15.06 ~- ITILMW 58.

INT. CAR SHOW - THE NEXT DAY

Richard and Erica are walking among the family cars. Richard
is a little uncomfortable. While they’re walking they pass
the model Nikki spoke to the day before. She nods at Richard
when Erica’s not looking.

ERICA
Are you okay?

RICHARD
Huh? Yeah. I’m great.

SECURITY GUARD
(to Richard)
Can’t get enough, huh?

ERICA
Who was that?

RICHARD
I don’t know.

ERICA
Hey, there goes the new mini-vans.
Let’s check them out.

SMALL MINI-VAN MONTAGE:

Just like the “cool” car montage but in this one Richard
isn’t excited. He’s bored out of his mind. No pretty girls

left town, so now’s my chance.

RICHARD
I’m not going to another state with
you to some guy’s apartment to pick

NIKKI
D.C.’s not another state. It’s a

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - SAME DAY

Nikki and Richard reach a door inside the apartment complex.
She is looking for her keys.

NIKKI
Here and New York. In Miami I
lived with his brother, that’s how
I met him.
(still looking in her
purse)
Where the hell are my keys?

RICHARD
You lived with a guy, then left him
and moved in with his brother? How
the fuck did you pull that off? I
have a hard time telling my wife I
want pancakes.

NIKKI
Hey, I’m not saying it was easy. I
really didn’t want to hurt him, but
I had to follow my heart.

Richard thinks about it. Then...

RICHARD
That’s what I like about you. You
don’t care what anybody says. You
do whatever you want.

NIKKI
You‘re wrong. I don’t do whatever
I want. I try to do whatever I
want. Big difference.
(beat)
Damn, he changed the locks.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 63.

NIKKI

Neither did I.

Richard follows Nikki into the apartment.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Nikki and Richard walk in. Nikki starts going. through stuff
while Richard looks around. The large windows look out onto
the POURING RAIN. He finds a photo album on a table and
looks through it. We SEE old pictures of Nikki. Nikki at
the prom, as a cheerleader, etc.

RICHARD
It’s really coming down.
(dawning on him)
We gotta get a flight. What time
is it?
He looks at his watch. Nikki is oblivious going through her
things.

NIKKI
Just one second. Here, can you
carry these?

 
02.15.06 - ITILMW 64.

She hands Richard a bunch of DVD's and a man’s shirt. She
pulls off her shirt, down to her bra, and starts pulling on a
different one that she found.

RICHARD
South Park? I didn’t know you
liked South Park.

NIKKI
I love it. That's my favorite
movie.

They both start singing.

NIKKI/RICHARD
“Shut your fucking face, uncle
fucker / You're a motherfuckin’
bitch, uncle fucker / You're an
uncle fucker / Yes, it’s true /
Nobody fucks uncle quite like you."

A voice is HEARD off screen.

TEDDY (0.C.)
Can I help you?

They both turn, startled, to find TEDDY, a fat guy with dread
locks, dressed in a football jersey. He stands at the open
door.

NIKKI
Teddy. I’m just-

TEDDY
Who the fuck is this? You brought
your man to my crib? So this is
the nigga.

Teddy walks up to Richard and Richard stick out his hand to
shake.

RICHARD
No, no, I’m not the nigga. I
assure you, I am not the nigga.

Teddy cuts him off with a slap to the face. He drops the
shirt on the floor.

TEDDY
Don’t drop my shirt on the floor,
bitch!
02.15.06 - ITILMW 65.

RICHARD
Oh shit, look, I’m sorry I didn’t
know. .

Teddy swings at Richard. Richard covers up. The blow hits
him on the arm and head and he falls, knocking down a lamp
that falls and breaks.

TEDDY
Hey, nigger, that shit’s Chinese.
You.owe me four grand.

Teddy starts punching and kicking at Richard who is curled in
a ball.

NIKKI
Teddy, calm down.

TEDDY
No, you calm down. I can’t believe
you brought this nigger in my
house.

NIKKI
Stop it, Teddy! Stop!

TEDDY
Stop what, bitch?! You want some
of this?

He runs over and grabs her hair. She screams. A voice is
HEARD off screen. Richard jumps on Teddy’s back.

VOICE (0.8.)
Hey! Watch your mouth.

They all turn around to see TWO COPS standing at the open
door. .

TEDDY
What the fuck do y’all want?

We were responding to a burglary

They start beating him up, Rodney King style.
TEDDY
Aaah! Bitch ass cops! Fuck the

Nikki runs over to Richard and helps him up. The cops are
still beating Teddy.

NIKKI
Richard, are you alright?

RICHARD
Yeah. Let’s get out of here before
they start whooping our ass.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
They sneak out as the cops beat the hell out of Teddy.

NIKKI

Just spending money I don’t have.
When I saw you I started to not

RICHARD
So, my boss is mad at me. My wife
is mad at me. But it’s okay, I’11

NIKKI
You know, if I thought you were
happy I wouldn’t even bring this
up, but why are you still with your
wife? Every time you talk about
her you seem depressed.

- RICHARD
I don’t know... I’m with her ‘cause
she was with me when I had no
money. Because she’s a good mother
to Kelly. I guess I’m with her
because I love her.

NIKKI
You didn’t say it right.

RICHARD
Don’t start that shit again. How
the hell am I supposed to say it?

NIKKI
You’re supposed to say you’re with
her because you love her and you
can’t live without her, but you
can’t. You’re with her because you
feel indebted. You’re not in
love, you’re in loyal. That’s sad.

You and your wife don’t talk, you

NIKKI
You don’t tell her about the

RICHARD
What’s so big about tonight?

NIKKI
A guy I met at the restaurant is
going to introduce me to one of the
owners of Tavern on the Green who
might be able to give me a hostess
job.

RICHARD
What do you need me for?

NIKKI
Okay, I know this guy is after me.
Damn, he comes to the restaurant

you to tell me what you think about
him.

RICHARD
Do you like him?

NIKKI
Why? You jealous?

RICHARD
No, I’m not but you want my opinion
of the guy, you must like hima

NIKKI
Please. He drives a Bentley and
wears. a big watch with diamonds. I
don’t go for that stuff. He
produces records. His name is

ERICA
This isn’t about chicken. What’s

What’s wrong is there are other

Just asking, just asking.

Richard now has two champagne bottles and is singing even
louder with his shirt unbuttoned. He’s dancing with the gay

The girls and the gay salesman are now dancing without
Richard. PAN from the girls to Richard, who is now sitting
down, .realizing how fucked up he is. He’s burnt out. He
mops at his forehead with a napkin, tries to focus, and looks
at his watch. He realizes it’s very late. Richard climbs out
of the booth, past them, searching through the CROWD and
finding Hope.

RICHARD
Where the hell's Nikki?
HOPE
I just got off the phone with her.
ft She told me to tell you she’s sorry

she’s not going to make it. She
said she’s. going to Miami with some
guy named Delite. Something about
Puffy having a party.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 86.

At that moment Richard starts to sober up while EVERYBODY
around him is having the time of their lives. He can’t
believe what he just heard. He’s crushed. Suddenly his phone
is ringing. He checks the caller I.D. screen.

ANGLE ON RICHARD’s PHONE: It reads “Home”. Richard,
realizing he can’t answer the phone in the club, runs fast
for a back door.

INT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S HOUSE - LATER *
ERICA *
Where have you been? Are you gonna *
tell me why you were acting so
crazy? Screaming about chicken... *
Are you fucking some bitch?! Are *
you fucking somebody? I swear if I *

find out you...

RICHARD
No, no! I’m not fucking around. I
swear to God. I’m sorry. I was
wrong to scream at you like that. *
I've just been really stressed out
about work and the baby, and I just
needed some air.

ERICA
You still haven’t told me where
you've been.

RICHARD
I just went to a sports bar and

As a matter of fact they annoyed

A BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMAN walks by putting on lipstick.

What’s wrong with her? She should
do that shit at home.

A BEAUTIFUL RED HEAD walks by on a cell-phone.

Who the hell is she talking to? I

What’s new with you?

NIKKI
Well, I just got back from St.
Barts with Sean. A boy? Good for
you.

RICHARD
And Sean is... what? The guy who
buys your toothpaste? What
happened to Delite?

NIKKI
I think he’s gay. He liked a
finger in his ass a little too much ,
for me. Poor Delite. Now I have a
fiance, Sean. I can’t wait for you
to meet him.

RICHARD
So what is it? Real love or a
sponsor?

NIKKI
You know, I was at a party a couple
of months ago and I was talking to
this guy, he must have been about
forty and something felt weird. We
weren’t talking about anything out
of the ordinary just books and
while we were talking this little
twenty-two year old girl walks by
and he just says, “excuse me” and
runs over and tries to talk to her.
I was a little embarrassed and then
I realized what was wrong. For the
first time in my adult life I was
having a conversation with a
straight man who wasn’t thinking
about fucking me. It never even
crossed his mind. So when I met
Sean I said to myself “I gotta make
this work.” We’re getting married
in June.

We hear his voice, we see him shake
hands with Richard, but we never see his face.)

I’m never in California. I guess

So this is... What you want? You

Do I love him? Not right now. But
ten years from now, who knows? I’m

house, nice husband, easy dull
life. But I can tell you that I’11
never love him the way I love you.

RICHARD
Come on, don’t go there. You and
me... we just got bad timing.

NIKKI
I know. But don’t you think we'd
make each other happy?

RICHARD
Everybody says you’re supposed to
be happy. That’s bullshit! If
everybody was happy everybody
wouldn’t be happy. Everybody can’t
be happy.

NIKKI
I’m not talking about everybody,
I’m talking about us. You and me,
happy together.

Pulls out his wallet, opens a compartment and pulls out a

Nikki?

He turns the doorknob.

NIKKI (0.S.)
It’s open. Come in.

Richard goes into the apartment, walks through it to the
bathroom. He opens the door. It’s filled with steam. As the
steam escapes through the open door, he sees Nikki in
panties, bra and a pair of black Jimmy Choo shoes. She’s
rubbing lotion on herself. She walks over to the shower and
cuts it off. Then she hands Richard the lotion she’s holding
and says--

NIKKI
You made it. I was thinking you
might not come. I thought you'd
get scared and not show up.

RICHARD
Scared of what?

NIKKI
I don’t know. Just scared. Could
you rub some of this on my back?

He puts down his briefcase takes the lotion and starts to rub
it on her back. He’s a little nervous. He rubs a little in
then stops.

RICHARD
I think I got it.

She puts her arms around him and gives hima lite kiss.

NIKKI
Thank you.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 99.

She walks away from him to the other side of the room. We see
Richard in the foreground. As she walks away we hear her say--

NIKKI (CONT'D)
Do you mind if I keep these shoes
on?

RICHARD
It’s okay. I don’t mind.

MUSIC STARTS: “DARLING NIKKI” BY PRINCE.

PRINCE
I KNEW A GIRL NAMED NIKKI /
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY SHE WAS A SEX
FIEND...

Richard starts to take off his jacket. Nikki walks to the
bed and lays down flat on her back. Her head is on a pillow.
The song keeps playing. Nikki stares at Richard as if to
say, “what’s up?”

PRINCE
I MET HER IN A HOTEL LOBBY
MASTURBATING WITH A MAGAZINE...

Richard stares back at Nikki. Then with his back to her he
pats his crotch. He can’t believe how hard he is. This
Viagra shit works. Nikki is on the bed laid out. She’s
looking hard at Richard. All we see of her is her head and
her breast as she says-—-

NIKKI
What are you doing all the way over
there? I thought you weren’t

scared.

RICHARD
I’m not scared. I’m just looking at
you.

NIKKI

Well.come over here, I won’t bite.

Richard slowly walks across the room and stands at the foot
of the bed.

NIKKI (CONT'D)
I’m really going to miss you.

RICHARD
I’m going to miss you, too.

 
02.15.06 - ITILMW 100.

Just then Nikki puts both her ankles on Richard’s shoulders.
We can see that she still has her shoes on. The CAMERA goes
from her face to Richard’s face. We never see her crotch.
Then she says--

NIKKI
So what are you waiting for?

AT THAT MOMENT, we see Richard reach down and take off her
panties. Remember we never see her crotch. The reason we
know that Richard took off her panties is because we saw them
come past her left shoe. Richard starts to pounce on her and
Nikki says--

NIKKI
Wait. Take off you sweater.

Richard begins to take off the turtleneck until only his face
shows.

AT THAT MOMENT, he turns to see himself in the MIRROR next to
Nikki on the bed and FREEZES. He looks horrified by what he
sees because what he sees is the turtleman. The character he
acts out with his son and daughter. We FLASH back to see
Richard in the earlier scenes playing turtleman with his
kids. THE MUSIC DROPS OUT SUDDENLY. THERE IS NO SOUND. NO
MUSIC, NO AMBIENT SOUND. TOTAL SILENCE.

The silence is broken as he takes a deep breath and looks in
the mirror. He pulls the shirt back on, gathers up his
things and leaves the apartment as fast as he can. The MUSIC
starts back up where we HEAR Prince screaming “Nikki, Nikki!”
The music keeps playing.
NIKKI
What’s wrong? What’s wrong? Where
are you going?!

CUT TO:

EXT. - NIKKI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
We SEE Richard running down Nikki's staircase.

cur TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER

We SEE Richard walking fast down a city street looking a
little shaken. Prince is still playing.

INT. RICHARD'S OFFICE/ RECEPTION AREA - LATER
MUSIC STOPS.
Tracy is on the phone.

TRACY
Listen, I'll be there at four. Wait
for me.

Richard enters and walks straight to his office without a
hello. He looks upset and sweaty from running.

TRACY
I’m glad you’re back. You have a
few calls to return.

INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE - SAME

He shuts the door, paces around nervously. He then goes to
the phone and after a deep breath, dials. We HEAR a phone
message with Erica’s voice.

ERICA (V.0.)
Hello. You've reached the home of
Erica and Richard. Nobody’s here
to take your call so leave your
name and your number, and we'll get
back to you.

Richard hangs up. Then he leaves the office walking by Tracy
and Mary.
INT. RECEPTION AREA - MOMENTS LATER

MARY
When will you be back?

Richard leaves without a sound.

CUT TO:

INT. NIKKI’S APARTMENT - LATER

Nikki still naked is smoking a cigarette and talking on the
phone.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 102.

NIKKI
(into phone)
Yes, just sitting here doing
nothing... Yeah, I’1ll bring it...
Okay, honey. I’11 see you
tomorrow... Love you, too.

She hangs up the phone and looks real sad. A tear rolls down
her cheek.

EXT. RICHARD AND ERICA’S HOUSE - LATER

Richard walks in the front door.

CUT TO:

EXT. RICHARD'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Richard walks in like a mad-man and starts looking
frantically for Erica.

RICHARD
Erica... Erica...

Richard runs upstairs, opens his bedroom door and finds his
wife, Erica, having sex with their friend, Allen--from
behind.

ERICA
Fuck me. Fuck me.

RICHARD
Nooo...

BACK TO:

INT. RICHARD’S LIVING ROOM - REALITY

Erica is at the desk grading papers. Richard walks in again
like a mad-man.

ERICA
You scared me. What are you doing
home so early? Everything alright?

RICHARD
We're are the kids?
02.15.06 - ITILMW 103.

ERICA
I just dropped them off at my
mother’s house.

RICHARD
Everything’s fine. I was just
missing you and thought I’d come
home early.

ERICA
Are you sure that’s it? For once
could you be honest and tell me
what’s really wrong with you?

MUSIC STARTS

Richard and Erica start to talk/sing at each other, but not
“sing sing” more of a talk-sing like the beginning of a Barry
White or Rick James and Teena Marie record. Romantic music
plays throughout the end of this scene.

RICHARD
You know, baby, I.just wanna tell
you how sorry I am for being so
cold. It’s not that I don’t like
being married. It’s just that
sometimes it feels like the walls
are closing in on me.

ERICA
I understand, baby. But it’s not
just you. I gotta admit that I’ve
been distant too. I haven’t always
been nice. As a matter of fact,
sometimes I’m as cold as ice.

RICHARD
So cold. So cold. You’ve been
very cold, baby.

ERICA
But one thing I have to ask you,
baby... it’s time I know the score,
but the thing I have to ask you is
how come you don’t make love to me
anymore?

RICHARD \
It’s been a long time.

ERICA
A mighty, mighty long time.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 104.

RICHARD
Baby, I still want you and I’ve
wanted you for so long. But every
time I touch you, you act like I_
did something wrong.

ERICA
No, I don’t.

RICHARD
Yes, you do.
ERICA
No, I don’t.
RICHARD
Yes, it’s true... I don’t want to
leave.
ERICA

Neither do I.

RICHARD
I still want you.

ERICA
I’m gonna cry.

RICHARD
Where are the kids?

ERICA
I told you. They’re gone.

RICHARD
In that case, we should make love.

BIG ENDING NOTE IN UNISON:

RICHARD AND ERICA
All night long. Yeah.

Big swell in the music and then it stops.

RICHARD
I love you, baby.

ERICA
I love you, too.
02.15.06 - ITILMW 105.

At that moment, Erica and Richard start kissing passionately
and taking each other’s clothes off.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COOPER HOUSE - LATER

We see Richard come out of the master bedroom just: like in
the beginning of the movie. We see him put on his coat and
walk over to Erica and give her a big kiss goodbye. V.0O.
starts as Richard leaves the house. Al Green's, “Let Get
Married” is playing.

RICHARD (V.0.)
A lot of people have rules about
what's cheating and what’s not.
Some people say if you’re in
another country it’s not cheating.
Some people say if you’re in
another room it’s not cheating. I
used to think I was a good father
and a bad husband, but now I that
I’m older I realize that if you’re
cheating on your wife, you’re
cheating on your kids.

INT. AIRPLANE - SAME TIME

We see Nikki sitting in first class gazing out the window
, with her iPod on.

RICHARD (V.O.)
I’m really going to miss Nikki and
the bad thing is I can’t tell
anybody about it. I gotta keep this
whole thing to myself.

cur TO:

INT. TRAIN

Richard is sitting down, puts his iPod on and is looking out
the window as the train moves.

RICHARD (V.O.)
Any guy I’d tell would think I was
erazy for not having sex with her.
And any woman I tell would think I
was a dog for letting it get that
far.

RICHARD (V.0.)

It just wasn’t the right time. You

know when all is said and done, I

think I love my wife.
We see Richard start nodding his head to whatever music is
playing on his iPod. A BEAUTIFUL BLACK GIRL walks by him.
Richard takes a look and shakes his head in disbelief.

FADE TO BLACK:

THE END
