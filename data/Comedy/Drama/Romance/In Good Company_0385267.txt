A digital alarm clock hits 4:30 AM. The first note of a
SONG, the CREDITS MUSIC, starts as a hand turns off the alarm
clock.

INT. DAN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING - NIGHT

DAN FOREMAN, age 51, gets out of bed. His wife Ann, 46,
mumbles, doesn’t open her eyes.

EXT. DAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A light goes on in a window.

INT. DAN’S BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - NIGHT

Dan shaves, showers, it’s still dark outside. He looks at
the grey in his hair.

INT. DAN’S BEDROOM ~ EARLY MORNING - NIGHT

Dan gets dressed in the dark. Puts on his tie. Kisses Ann
on the forehead. Behind Ann is a picture of Dan‘s family.
Dan tiptoes out.

INT. DAN’'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING - NIGHT

Dan drinks coffee. On a small TV behind him, a business
channel is on. We see anti-WTO riots. Bill Gates. Images of
computer chips being manufactured in India. Dan turns the
SOUND UP as a new story comes on, the GLOBECOM logo with
MERGER RUMORS as a headline.

NEWS ANCHOR
After months of speculation,
analysts expect an announcement
this week that Globecom
International will acquire Waterman
Publishing and its flagship
magazine, Sports America.

Dan’s attention is caught.
NEWS ANCHOR

The man at the helm of Globecom,
billionaire media magnate Teddy K,
has been on a spending spree
recently -- acquiring a food
service company, a cable operator,
and two telecommunications
providers in deals totaling more
than 13 billion dollars.

(pause)
And, how did one lucky ferret owner
come to own the largest dog-treat
manufacturer on the east coast?

Dan turns off the TV. He dumps the used coffee grains in the
trash, where he sees the box for...a “Home Pregnancy Test
Kit”. He lifts it out of the garbage. Glances over at a
picture of his daughter Alex in tennis gear on the fridge.
Fear washes over his face.

Lights sweep over the window. A car horn BEEPS. Dan looks
at his watch.

EXT. DAN‘’S HOUSE, SUBURBS ~ EARLY MORNING - NIGHT

Dan gets in a cab.

EXT. AIRPORT —- MORNING

A plane takes off.

EXT. KALB AUTOMOTIVE - DAY

Dan gets out of a rental car.

INT. KALB’S OFFICE - DAY

EUGENE KALB is sixty-something, the CEO of Kalb Automotive.
He shakes hands with Dan.

KALB
Thanks for the Lakers tickets. The
seats were great, and I’m sick of
my damn luxury box.

DAN
I hope Taylor had a fun birthday
party.
KALB
(smiles)
My grandson had a terrific time.
But I still don‘t want to advertise
in the magazine. My son-in-law
tells me people don’t read anymore.
Too much effort moving the eyes
back and forth. We're putting our
budget into TV, radio and internet.

A pause. We’re ready for Dan to launch into a big pitch.

DAN
Okay.

KALB
“Okay?” What does that mean?

DAN
I‘m not going to try to sell you.

KALB
Why the hell not? You're a
salesman, aren‘t you?

DAN

Yes. I’m just not a very good one.
KALB

I‘1l say.
DAN

(laughs)
But I am going to ask you one
favor.

Dan takes an issue of SPORTS AMERICA magazine out of his
briefcase.

DAN
I'm going to leave you an issue of
the magazine. And I'll personally
send you a new one every week.
I‘ll call you again in a few weeks,
and if you want to, we'll talk.
There’s a pretty good article
comparing today’s quarterbacks with
Jonny Unitas.

KALB
There’s no comparison. Unitas
would kick their butts.

(MORE )
KALB (cont'd)
(holds up magazine)
So this is your sales pitch?

DAN
Yeah. I've worked at the Magazine
for over twenty years, and I
believe in it.

KALB
Good for you. You worried about
all these rumors that your parent
company's gonna be sold?

DAN
Not really. Can't see how it would
affect me.
KALB
Well, hopefully it won't.
{gets up)

You know, that Teddy K. character
offered to buy my business a few
years ago. Wanted to merge us with
Pep Boys. I told him to screw
himself...who knows, Maybe I was
dumb. My son-in-law says I'ma
dinosaur.

DAN
Hey, don’t knock the dinosaurs.
They ruled the earth for millions
of years. They must have been doing
something right.

Kalb laughs. The two of them shake hands.

INT. GLOBECOM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CLOSEUP ON a DINOSAUR, or, more accurately, a cell-phone

shaped like a dinosaur, held by CARTER DURYEA, 26,
executive.

CARTER
We will never be able to reach this
significant, untapped market unless
we learn to think like them. In
point of fact, less than .05
percent of all cell phone users are
currently beneath the age of five
years old.

(MORE)

a young
CARTER (cont'd)
The Triceratops phone, the T-Rex
phone, and the Pterodactyl phone
are going to change all that.
And...each phone will have its own
unique ring.

The cell phone ROARS like a dinosaur.

CARTER
(little kid voice)
Mommy...I want one...buy me one for
Christmas...

At the end of the conference table sits STECKLE, the boss of
this group of young marketing execs.

STECKLE
P.F.G., Carter. P.F.G.

YOUNG EXEC #1
(whispers to Carter)
What's P.F.G?

CARTER
Pretty frigging good.

Carter makes the phone ROAR again. Steckle looks up from
checking the email on his handheld blackberry.

STECKLE
Gentlemen, ladies, I have an
announcement to make. It’s on.
Teddy K. has busted his move, and
we are taking over Waterman
Publishing.

The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE.

STECKLE

The man has vision. He’s a maniac.
And I guess it’s okay for me to
tell you, Teddy K has personally
asked me to go over there and turn
around marketing in the magazine
division. So, if you'll excuse me.
Carry on.

Steckle gets up and leaves the meeting. Everyone starts
talking.

YOUNG EXEC #1
(excited, to Carter)
Waterman Publishing -- wow --
6.
CARTER a
Yeah, yeah, yeah —-
Carter hurries out the door.
INT. GLOBECOM HALLWAY — DAY
Carter follows Steckle down the hall.
CARTER
Mark! Mark!
He catches up with him, dodging past other people in the
hall.
CARTER
Okay, so you're taking me with you.
You have to take me with you.
STECKLE
Carter, I'm gonna take that place
and whip its fat ass into shape...
And...
CARTER
And? : ~
STECKLE

And I want you to come run ad sales
at Sports America.

CARTER
I knew it!

STECKLE
The magazine's a cash cow. It's
the cornerstone. I mentioned your
name to Teddy K. He liked what you
did with cell phones.

CARTER
Wait, hold up. Teddy K. knows my
name?

STECKLE

I’m going to tell you something and

i don’t want it to go to your head.
(pause)

You‘re being groomed.
CARTER
I’m being groomed?
(pause)
Mark, thank you. I am going to
kick so much ass for you. I will
take no prisoners. I will be your
ninja assassin!

STECKLE
(cheerful)
Wow, you're the new me!
(beat, dead serious)
No. I’m the new me.
(smiles)
Congratulations!

Steckle walks off. Carter gives a KARATE KICK.

INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALEX, Dan’s 18 year old daughter, lies in bed, awake. She
has a tennis ball in her hand. She tosses it up in the air,
catches it with the same hand, repeating the motion over and
over.

EXT. DAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A cab pulls up, drops Dan off.

INT. DAN‘S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Going through the kitchen. Dan pauses, looks into the
wastebasket. The pregnancy kit is gone.

INT. DAN’S HOUSE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dan goes down the hall, opens a door, looks into his 16 year

door again. Continues down the hall, takes a deep breath,
and leoks in on Alex's room.

INT. ALEX’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALEX looks up from her bed.

ALEX
Hey, Dad.
8.
DAN wot!
Hey, button. What are you doing
awake?
ALEX
(shrugs)
Couldn't sleep,
DAN
Couldn’t sleep? Why? You worrying
about something?
ALEX
Not really.
DAN
Cause if you are worried about
something...you know you can always
talk to me. Remember, when you
were little, we made a deal, we'd
always be honest with each other.
ALEX
(laughs)
Yeah...I actually am a little
tired. We’re still Playing
tomorrow, right? —_
DAN
Sure.
ALEX

Alright, I’1l see you then.
(turns off the light)
Love you.

Love you too.

He closes the door, heading to his bedroom.

INT. DAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dan‘s wife ANN, 46, looks up as Dan changes out of his travel
clothes.

ANN
What time is it? Hi, sweetheart.
DAN
Little after three. Sorry I woke
you up. Go back to sleep.

Dan gets in bed beside her. He kisses her shoulder. She
kisses him back.

ANN
You're not tired?

DAN
Not really....Honey, does
umm...does Alex have a new

boyfriend?
ANN
Uh, no, not that I know of. Why?
DAN
Well...no reason. What about that
Myron kid?
ANN

(kisses him)

I think they’re just friends.
(pause)

I‘m pregnant --

DAN
What?!
(pause)
I'm sorry, I thought you said you
were pregnant.
(she nods)
You can’t be pregnant.

ANN
I know, but I am.
DAN
But -- How did that happen?
ANN
Well, I think you were there too.
DAN
No, honey. You’re done with all
that.
ANN

That's what Dr. Steinberg said,
but...I guess he was wrong.
10.

DAN
Are you sure?
(she nods)

Holy crap...holy crap! Does it
feel like a boy?

ANN
Right now it feels like a stomach
flu.
DAN
You can't be serious. Are you
serious?
(beat)

Alright...alright. This is going
to be fine. When he's twenty-one,
I’ll be...seventy-two.

ANN
Three.

DAN
Two.

ANN
Three.

DAN
Holy crap.

Dan lays back in bed, staring anxiously up at the ceiling.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CARTER (0.S.)
I am so excited.

Carter is lying in bed with his (newlywed) wife Kimberly.
He's on his back. She’s facing away from him.

CARTER
I am just so damn excited. Is this
excitement contagious, or what?

KIMBERLY
No.

CARTER
I’m being groomed. I am being
groomed. Do you understand what
that means?
il.

KIMBERLY
That you‘re a chimpanzee?

CARTER
It means...well, it means we’re on
the road. It’s all falling into
place. We can get a bigger house.
We can have kids. I mean, we have
a life going on here!

KIMBERLY
Carter, it’s three AM. How much
more enthusiasm are we looking at
here? Fifteen minutes? An hour?

CARTER
I don’t know, I’m sorry, it’s
just...Teddy K. knows my name.

KIMBERLY
Are you even qualified for this
job?

CARTER

What? Sure. Selling cell phones,
selling ad space, it’s all the same
crap. Anyway, it’s just a stepping
stone.

EXT. CARTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The lone light goes off.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE - DAY

CU. on computer monitor (spatially same as house) showing news
of GlobeCom's takeover of Waterman Publishing. PULL OUT to
reveal everyone freaking out in office. MORTY, middle aged,
dapper, and morbid, is saying to anyone who will listen (at
the moment, THEO, another salesman):

MORTY
We're all going to get fired.

THEO
Anything's possible.

MORTY
It's not possible, it’s probable.
12.

LOUIE, barrel chested, frenetic, comes down the hall with
ALICIA, a sales woman.

LOUIE
Have you heard about this Teddy K
guy?

ALICIA

Everyone’s heard of him --

LOUIE
I hear he’s an albino, but he
covers it up with makeup!

MORTY
Hey, Alicia! Alicia? Are you
fired yet?

ALICIA

What? No! Why, are you fired?

INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

A placard on the desk reads DAN FOREMAN -- VP AD SALES. Dan's
office has a great view of the city. It’s decorated with the
memorabilia from Dan’s more than twenty years at Sports
America.

Dan sits with his boss, ENRIQUE.

DAN
I‘m sorry, are you -- are you
saying I’m fired?

ENRIQUE
Not yet, not yet, Dan. But I can’t
predict the future. The thing is,
you‘re not head of ad sales
anymore. Carter Duryea is.

DAN
Who the hell is Carter Duryea?

ENRIQUE
Some hotshot from GlobeCom. This
is a bummer, Dan. A real bummer.
But you’re lucky. A lot of people
are getting canned immediately,
across the company.

DAN
Are you getting fired?
13.

ENRIQUE
Me? No.

DAN
We had our biggest year ever this
year. My team works incredibly
hard. I'm not going to put up with
this.

ENRIQUE
You have to put up with it. I
mean, what are you gonna do, start
somewhere new? You're not a kid
anymore. You know how tough it is
out there. Places are cutting
back, they’re not looking for guys
like you who make a decent salary.
Hey, I’m as pissed off about this
as you are.

DAN
So then why are you smiling?

ENRIQUE
I'm not smiling.

DAN
Your lips are curling up.

ENRIQUE
They do that naturally, Dan.
EXT. MADISON AVE - DAY

Publishing building.
INT. LOBBY, WATERMAN PUBLISHING BUILDING - DAY

Behind her, Carter HURRIES towards the elevator.

Hold up! Please.

Alex uses her racket to hold the door open.
14.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Carter and Alex are alone in the elevator. Alex pushes the
button for the 47th floor.

CARTER
47. Going to the Sports America
offices?

ALEX
Yup.

CARTER

+.-What are you, an intern?

ALEX
No. My Dad works there...Are you
interning there?

CARTER
I'm starting a new job there.

ALEX
Oh. Cool. Congratulations.
That’s awesome.

CARTER
Thank you.
(pause)
To be honest, I’m scared shitless.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

Alex laughs.

CARTER
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

ALEX
(laughs)
Okay. I won't.
She smiles at him. He smiles back. The elevator reaches the
floor, the door opens, and Carter's expression turns to one
of confidence.
CARTER
After you.
INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE, BY DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

Theo, a salesman, passes by Dan.
15.

THEO
Dan, your daughter’s here.

DAN
She is?

Dan starts down the hall.

ALICIA
Hey, Boss, what’s this takeover
gonna mean for our stock options?

DAN
I have no idea. And don’t call me
“Boss”.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE, HALLWAY - DAY

From the other direction comes Carter, led by DEBRA, the
receptionist.

DEBRA
(kissing ass)
So nice to meet you, Mr. Colon‘’s
very excited to work with you --

As Dan passes Morty’s office, Morty yells to Dan.

MORTY
Dan, you hear anything new? Are we
all fired?

DAN
(distracted)
Can’t talk now, Morty --

His head turned towards Morty, DAN WALKS RIGHT INTO CARTER.
It's a real COLLISION. Debra gives a GASP.

CARTER
OOOF!

DAN
Sorry!

CARTER

No, I’m sorry. You alright?

DAN
I'm fine. It was my fault. You
okay?
16.

CARTER
I think so. No broken bones.

DAN
Alright, then. No harm, no foul.

Dan moves on towards the reception area.

INT. RECEPTION, SPORTS AMERICA - DAY

Dan walks up to Alex.

ALEX
Hey, Dad.
DAN
Hey, champ. What are you doing
here?
ALEX
Umm, tennis, remember?
DAN
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
ALEX
Is today no good for you?
DAN
(beat)
No, it’s fine. Heck with it.
Let’s go.

EXT. ROOFTOP TENNIS COURT - DAY

Dan and Alex are playing tennis on a rooftop court. Alex
SERVES. Dan gets a racket on it, but just barely. The ball
goes FLYING.

In fact, she is an awesome tennis player, running Dan ragged
around the court. Dan tries to reach a crosscourt shot and
tumbles to the ground.

ALEX
You okay?

Dan looks over at his daughter, and dees some PUSHUPS.

AFTER their match, they sit on a bench. Dan is drenched.
17.

ALEX
You sort of sucked today.

DAN
I was holding back, to build up
your confidence.

ALEX

Yeah right. You're gettin’ old.
DAN

Thank you.
ALEX

Dad, remember how I was saying
maybe I’d want to transfer to NYU?
Well...I got in.

DAN
To NYU? Sweetheart, that’s
fantastic!
(beat)
But that means...you'd have to live
in the city.

ALEX
Yeah...I want to study creative
writing, and NYU has a great
program.

DAN
How about the tennis team?

ALEX
Dad...I’m not going to be a
professional tennis player.

DAN
Well look, button, it’s almost as
tough being a writer. Living in
the city, I don’t think it’s such a
great idea. It can be really
lonely, you need street smarts. I
just don’t think it’s a great idea.

ALEX
But I want to try living in the
city. I know NYU’s a lot more
expensive. But it would be such a
good experience.
 

18,

DAN
Yeah. It is more expensive, but...
(pause)
It’s your education, that’s the
most important thing...We can
Manage it.

She hugs him, elated. Over Alex’s shoulder, Dan’s face
falls, the pressure getting the best of him.

ALEX
(laughs)
Yech, you're like drenched.

When Alex pulls back, he smiles for her sake.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE - DAY
Enrique is going down the hall, showing Carter around.
ENRIQUE

This is Morty Wexler. Morty,
Carter Duryea.

CARTER

You're on the Ford account, right?
MORTY

Correct.
CARTER

Great to meet you.

MORTY
You too. I'm really looking
forward to working with you!

Enrique and Carter move on. Louie comes out of his office.

LOUIE
(in a mincing voice,
imitating Morty)
“I'm really looking forward to
working with you.”

Louie makes an “ass-kissing” sound.

MORTY
Bite me.

Further down the hall, Enrique leads Carter towards DAN’S
OFFICE.
19,

ENRIQUE
We have a terrific office for you,
great view. But it’s not cleared
out yet.

Enrique takes Carter into DAN’S OFFICE.

ENRIQUE
Not bad, hunh? Excuse me a second,
I’m just going to use the little
boy‘s room.

Enrique leaves Carter in Dan’s comfortable office. Carter
looks at the view.

CARTER
(impressed)
Tasty.
INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE, HALLWAY - DAY
Dan comes back into the office, showered and clean after his
game.
INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY
Carter is still waiting for Enrique. He is glancing at Dan’s

FAMILY PHOTOS, as well as photos of Dan with sports stars,
etc. when Dan comes in.

DAN
Can I help you?
CARTER
Oh! Sorry, this is your office.
DAN
Yeah.
(beat)
You‘re the guy I bumped into.
CARTER
Yes. You must be Dan Foreman.
(smiles)

Hi, I’m Carter Duryea.

DAN
You're Carter Duryea?

CARTER
Yes. Great to meet you.
DAN
The Carter Duryea who's coming in
to run ad sales?

CARTER
Correct.

Carter puts his hand out.

DAN
How old are you?

CARTER
Me? I’m twenty-six.

DAN
You’re twenty-six...

Dan shakes his hand.

DAN
++-and you're my new boss.

CARTER
I guess so...
(wincing)
Hey, that’s some...Kung-Fu Grip
you've got there.

Dan lets go of his hand.
DAN

So what kind of experience do you
have in ad sales?

CARTER
Not much.

DAN
How much?

CARTER
None.

DAN

None, Well, that’s not much.

CARTER
I'm a fast learner. So now you
know how old I am. How old are
you?

20.
21.

DAN
I’m fifty-one.
CARTER
Wow, that’s -- that’s crazy.
You're one year older than my
father.
Enrique comes in.
ENRIQUE
Great, you two have met!
CARTER
Yeah, we’re good pals already.
(smiles)
Well, nice to meet you.
DAN
Un-hunh. It was a pleasure.
ENRIQUE
Dan, you want this door closed?
DAN
Yeah, why don’t you go ahead and

close it.
They exit, Enrique closing the deor behind them.
Dan picks up an AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALL.

Across the room is a silver trophy-plate reading "1987 —
SALESMAN OF THE YEAR”.

He takes aim, and WHIPS THE BALL AT THE PLATE, SENDING IT
FLYING.

INT. HALLWAY BY DAN'S OFFICE - DAY

A plate reading DAN FOREMAN, VICE PRESIDENT AD SALES is slid
out of its holder as MOVING MEN transfer Dan’s stuff to a
smaller office. Dan steps into his new office, watching the
boxes pile up.

EXT. PORSCHE DEALERSHIP ~ DAY

Carter walks with a well-dressed man, an uncle, perhaps? The
man looks proud of him.
22.

CARTER
It was pretty unexpected. It’s
like a pretty big promotion.

PORSCHE DEALER
Wow! That's fantastic! Way to go.

The camera reveals that he is in a Porsche dealership. The
man accompanying him is a salesman.

PORSCHE DEALER
(stops in front of a car)
So, the Boxster S-type has more
guts. You’ll sure feel the extra
horsepower. But if you really want
to go, I’d say take the Nine Eleven
Carrerra.
CARTER
(considers)
T‘ll take the Nine Eleven.
INT. PORSCHE - DAY
Carter tries out the stereo. The cup holders. The seat
warmer.
EXT. PORSCHE DEALERSHIP LOT - LATER

Carter ZOOMS out of the lot in a new, black Porsche Carrerra.

INT. PORSCHE 911 — DAY

An SUV SLAMS into the front of his car.

(calls out)

Jackass!
EXT. CARTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
The damaged Porsche pulls up into Carter‘s driveway. Carter
gets out, his arm in a sling.
INT. CARTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Carter walks in, noticing a couple of SUITCASES by the door.

Kimberly is standing there.

KIMBERLY
Hi.

CARTER
Hi. I uh...I hurt my arm. But I’m
okay.

KIMBERLY

I’m glad you‘re okay. Carter...
She nods to the suitcases.

CARTER
Kim...Kimmy...Again? Come on.
Seven months. We've been married
seven months. I know things have
been a bit off. I’ve been putting
in crazy hours at my job. I know
we should have -- we should have
gone on a real honeymoon, that was
my fault. I should have -- TI should
have shut off that cell phone --
that thing was ringing off the
hook! The good thing is, I can
change. This has been a great
lesson to me. Thank you.
KIMBERLY
Don’t try to sell me, Carter.

CARTER
(plowing on)
Kim, I love you. I want to have
children with you.

KIMBERLY
But I don’t want to have children
with you. I don’t even know if I
want to have children, period. I
told you that. I told you on our
second date.

CARTER
I thought you were joking.

KIMBERLY
Carter...is this really such a
surprise to you?

CARTER
---Are you...sleeping with someone
else?

KIMBERLY

++-I was. But I broke up with him.
Carter bursts out laughing.
CARTER
Wow, that must have been rough on
him!
She goes and picks up her bags.
KIMBERLY
I'll be at my parents. They're
really excited to have me back.

Carter covers his face. We hear a HEARTBEAT.

INT. OBSTETRICIAN‘S OFFICE — DAY

24.

Dan stares nervously at Ann as the obstetrician listens for

the baby’s heartbeat with a “stereo” stethoscope.

OBSTETRICIAN
We're gonna hear two heartbeats
now, that strong slower one is
yours, mom.
25.

Dan listens as A STRONG, STEADY HEARTBEAT is heard over the
scope’s amplifier. The obstetrician fishes around.

A QUIETER, FASTER HEARTBEAT is heard beside the bass drum of
Ann's pulse.

OBSTETRICIAN
And that...that’s your baby’s
heartbeat.

ANN
Oh my God...

Ann smiles, looking up at Dan, who is looking pale.

OBSTETRICIAN
Nice strong heartbeat. That’s your
new baby, Dan.

Dan looks stressed out. Subjectively, with Dan, we hear an
IRREGULAR beat joining the other beats. He tries to smile,
grimacing instead.

ANN
Dan?

DAN
Yes?

ANN

Are you okay?

DAN
Yeah...that's...fantastic...I’m --
I just feel a little -- you know --

CUT TO: Dan‘s shirt is open, and the doctor is listening to
DAN‘S HEARTBEAT.

OBSTETRICIAN
Well, you are having a little bit
of arrhythmia. Have you been
drinking a lot of caffeine? Are
you under a lot of stress?

DAN
Well...I did sort of get demoted at
work.

OBSTETRICIAN

Ah.
26.

ANN
You what?
DAN
{nods, tries to smile)
We'll talk.

Ann looks shocked.

INT. PORSCHE IN DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

CU McDonalds wrapper on the passenger seat.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A Grande cup of STARBUCKS coffee is drained by Carter.
Carter's assistant, SAMMY, comes up to him holding a new cup.

SAMMY
Another?

CARTER
Yeah, don’t even ask, just keep it
coming.

Carter starts on the next cappuccino as he goes to the head
ef a long conference table. The entire sales team, as well
as everyone's secretaries, and even a couple of the
janitorial staff, are gathered. Dan sits among the rest of
the sales team.

CARTER
How was everyone's weekend? Good?
{puts his face in his
hand)
I'm sorry, that was...

An uncomfortable pause, as Carter gathers himself.

CARTER
All right! I'd like to thank
everyone for joining me. As most
of you know, my name’s Carter
Duryea and I am really excited to
be working with such a great group
of people.

CARTER (cont'd)
Like Teddy K. says, what makes
Globecom great...is the men and

women...of Globecom -- is it like a
thousand degrees in here, or is it
me?

(beat)
It’s me.

Morty looks at Dan, concerned.

CARTER
Now I’ve been given an agenda here,
and you’re gonna learn this about
me, I’m a machine...
(Carter blanks)
What was I saying?

ALICIA
An agenda?

CARTER
Agenda, yes. In order to achieve
the goals that have been set out
for us, we are going to have to
increase ad pages by 20 percent.

There is a MURMUR in the room. Carter sucks down some more
coffee.

MORTY
(whispers. to Louie)
Shit, I knew it.

DAN
{with disbelief)
Twenty percent? Carter, only a
start up magazine can do that.

CARTER
Well I think this team can do it.

MORTY
(tentative)
Uh. . «How?

DAN
(automatic)
Well, Morty --

CARTER
(cuts him off)
Good question. And the answer...
(an epiphany)
»-.is synergy.
(MORE)
Silence.

28.

CARTER (cont'd)
To take it to the next level, we
need to team up, we need to
synchronize, we need to synergize!
We're not alone here. We're not
alone! We are now part of one of
the biggest multimedia and brand
hame companies in the universe.
Let’s take advantage of that. Did
you know that one of our sister
companies makes Krispity Krunch?

DAN
So?

CARTER
So we talk to our brothers and
sisters at Krispity Krunch, and we
make a deal to supply Sports
Factoids for their boxes, so when
Joe Couch Potato is snacking, what
does he see? Sports America
Krispity Krunch Sports Factoids!
He's definitely getting more
Krispity Krunch, and he’s
definitely not getting Krunch ‘n‘
Krackle, which looks and tastes
exactly the same, but has no sports
Factoids. Krispity Krunch is so
pleased with the idea that they
guarantee twenty-six pages a year.
Besides which, they know Teddy kK.
Is gonna be pissed if they don’t
pony up. Bingo -- synergy!

DAN
Isn‘t that cheating?

CARTER
Hell no! And you know what else?
We also own Starline Cell Phones.
What do we put on their browser?

DAN
Factoids?

CARTER
Yes! Factoids! Synergy! You know
what else? Box scores! And ads!
We make a deal where one-hundred
thousand hits on the internet has
an equivalent value of one ad page
in our hard copy.

(MORE)
29.

CARTER (cont'd)

Are you getting it, people? The
Magazine is now just a sort of
portal to a synergized world of
cross-promotion! Let’s open things
wide here, people! Let’s get
psyched!
Come on, let’s take the plunge,
let’s embrace something new!

(pointing)
Louie, are you psyched about this?

LOUIE
++»I’m psyched.
CARTER
Okay. Alicia, are you psyched?
ALICIA
Absolutely.
CARTER

You...what’s your name?

MAINTENANCE GUY
Hector. I’m in maintenance.

CARTER
Oh. That’s cool. Hector, I know
you‘re psyched.

MAINTENANCE GUY
I’M PSYCHED!

CARTER
Alright, Hector’s psyched! And if
Hector'’s psyched, then I‘m psyched!
I am psyched for this team! Who
else is psyched!

People call out “I’m psyched!”

MORTY
(leans over to Louie)
Who do you think will be the first
to get canned?

LOUIE
(whispers )
My bet’s on Dan. He’s prehistoric.
30.

INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - DAY

Carter and Dan sit at a sushi restaurant. Carter’s LEG
BOUNCES with nervous energy.

CARTER
I’m glad you could join me for
lunch, Dan. Do you like sushi?

DAN
I'll stick with the teriyaki.

CARTER
You should try some! The spicy
tuna roll is awesome here. Here,
try it!

Carter holds out his plate, which is covered with sushi.

CARTER
Get that. Get that. Go fishin’
man.

Dan looks at it a moment, then takes a bite.

DAN
(hates it)
Mmm ~- yeah. Really...raw.

CARTER
(talks over him)

So I wanted to talk to you, because
the increase in ad pages is only
part of the equation in terms of
achieving the bottom line my bosses
want me to hit. I'm also going to
have to get rid of 300 K salary
from the sales team, immediately.

DAN

Carter, I don’t make that much

money.
CARTER

I know what you make, Dan.
DAN

Alright. Well.

(gets up)

I wish you told me I was fired
before I ate the goddam fish.
31.

CARTER
Hey, hold on a second, I’m not
letting you go here.

DAN
You're not?

CARTER
No. Look, you're an excellent
salesman, you ran a good team, and
I think there’s the potential for
you to be an awesome wing man.

DAN
An awesome wing man. Well, Carter,
I can see the benefit to you in
having an awesome wing man. But
what's the benefit to me, at this
point in my career, in being an
awesome wing man?

CARTER
Well, one benefit, at this point in
your career, is you get to keep
your job. That‘s a pretty good
benefit, don’t you think?

Dan stands there, considering.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE - DAY

The salesman are hushed, as SWEARING is heard from down the
hall, behind the closed door of Carter’s (Dan’s old) office.

ENRIQUE (0.S.)
Are you smiling? You're smiling at
me -- you think this is funny!

Enrique emerges from Carter's office.

ENRIQUE
That A-HOLE. We'll see how soon
this place goes down the SHITTER
without me! That LITTLE, SNOT-
NOSED BRAT!

Enrigue STORMS past where Morty and Dan are drinking coffee.
Morty raises his eyebrows at Dan.

MORTY
Maybe there is justice in the
world.
32.

Enrique pushes past a group of eavesdropping salespeople on
his way to the elevator.

ENRIQUE
You enjoying yourselves? Great.

As Enrique leaves, Alicia and Theo do a little high-five.

INT. CARTER‘S (DAN’S OLD) OFFICE - DAY

Having just fired Enrique, Carter sags, leaning his head
against the closed door.

MUSIC RISES over the following montage.

INT. DAN’S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Dan puts a copy of the magazine into a Fedex packet to send
to EUGENE KALB in Los Angeles,

Sammy, Carter’s twenty-something assistant, appears at his
door.

SAMMY

(snappy)
Carter's ready for you.

INT. CARTER‘S (DAN’S OLD) OFFICE ~ DAY

The office is empty and stark, absent the clutter of Dan’s
pictures and memorabilia. Carter hands Dan a booklet of
forms in the Globecom blue color.

CARTER
Dan, I'd like you to fill this out,
please --

Carter sees Dan glance at the lone photo on his shelf -- a
picture of Kimberly. Carter turns the picture over on it’s
face.

CARTER
It’s a 360 evaluation.

DAN
And that is?
33.

CARTER
It’s a self-evaluation. They call
it 360 because it’s supposed to be
from every angle. It’s corporate
policy. It‘d be great if you have
it on Monday.

Carter pats Dan on the arm, dismissing him.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Carter addresses a group of buyers, Dan at his side.

CARTER
If you want to get aggressive, if
you want to reach that core
demographic --

DAN
I believe --

CARTER
(cuts him off)
Not now, Dan.
(to buyers)
Sports America is the top magazine,
boys twelve to eighteen, in the
country.

Dan deflates a little.

INT. CARTER'S (DAN’S OLD) OFFICE ~ NIGHT

Late at night. A janitor goes by as Carter works late.

INT. CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSEUP PROFILE Carter runs against a jungle background. For
a moment it looks as if he’s out in the wild. He has a phone
to his ear.

KIM’S VOICE (0.S.)
Hi, leave me a message! Or don’t.

BEEP.

We PULL BACK, revealing Carter is jogging on a treadmill by
his flat-screen TV, which has a nature show on.
34.

CARTER
(leaving message)
Hi, it’s me. I mean, you know it’s
me, I guess I'm...filling up the
old mailbox...anyway, call me back.
Or don’t.

He hangs up. Looks at the phone again.

INT. CARTER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Carter squats in front of a fish tank with a single goldfish
in it. He TAPS the tank, trying to get the fish's attention.

CARTER
Here boy. Here boy. Here.
INT. CARTER’'S HOUSE — DAY
Carter is back on the treadmill, calling an old friend.
CARTER
Oh, hi, Mrs. Charneski, is Jeff
there? Oh, he did? Okay, well,
please tell him Carter said hi.
INT. DAN’S HOUSE, SUBURBS
Dan sits watching TV. The PHONE RINGS.
DAN
Hello?
INT. CARTER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
Carter waves at the goldfish.

CARTER
Here boy. HEY.

The fish is oblivious.

INT. DAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Dan sits eating popcorn, watching TV. The phone rings.

CARTER (0.S.)
‘Hey, Dan! Carter here.
35.

DAN
Who?

CARTER (0.S.)
(chuckles )
Carter Duryea. Listen, I’d like to
get the group together tomorrow and
go over some business development
ideas.

DAN
Tomorrow's Sunday.

CARTER (0.S.)
Right! We'd get a great jump on
the week. I‘m not talking the
whole day, just the afternoon, meet
at noon, I’11 order some sushi,
it‘ll be fun. Great!

Carter hangs up. Dan looks at the phone, shocked.

EXT. MADISON AVE - DAY

Dan walks up to the building on Sunday, looking angry.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE ~ DAY

Dan walks into the Sports America office. It’s empty.

INT. CARTER'S (DAN'S OLD) OFFICE - DAY
Carter sits at his desk, pressing his fingers into his eyes.

STECKLE (0.S.)
What the hell are you doing?

From Carter’s POV, we see Steckle in double.

CARTER
Uh, nothing, just...seeing stars.
You ever do that?

STECKLE
Yeah, when I was three.

CARTER
What are you doing here on a
Sunday?
36.

STECKLE
Sunday is a fun day to kick some
ass.

CARTER

Absolutely. Hey, my team’s coming
in. Dan Foreman’s here, you should
meet him,

STECKLE
Yeah, I'd rather not get personally
involved. Didn't we decide to let
him go?

CARTER
No, I let go of Enrique Colon
instead, remember?

STECKLE
Oh, yeah, that's right. Dida
little “Colon Cleansing”. Get it?

CARTER
(laughs)
That's good. Hey, you want to have
dinner tonight?

STECKLE
Wish I could, but I‘m flying to
Berlin to meet with some of our
satellite guys.

CARTER
(disappointed)
Oh. That‘s too bad.
STECKLE
Why? Something wrong?
CARTER
No, just...
(beat)
Ah, my wife and I are having a few
problems...
STECKLE

Okay, gotta go. Look, you’re gonna
have to riff some more people.

CARTER
Riff them?
37.

STECKLE

Reduction in forces. Shitcan them.
CARTER

Listen, I -- I think we can get

pages up, so we don’t have to riff
anyone yet.

STECKLE
Fine. But sooner or later, we all
have to deal with reality.

Steckle leaves.

INT. HALL BY CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Night. A group of salesmen are leaving the imposed Sunday
meeting. Carter stands outside the door, still full of
energy, saying goodbye as everyone finally leaves to go home.

CARTER
Great work, thanks for coming in!
Night, Morty! Night Louie! What
are you guys up to? Want to go out
for a beer?

LOUIE
I‘d love to, but I'm a recovering
alcoholic.

CARTER

Oh. Better not then. Morty?

MORTY
I'd better get home for dinner. My
wife is slowly poisoning me to
death, and she gets very angry if
I‘m late.

CARTER
(beat)
Okay. No problemo. Alicia?

ALICIA
No, I have to get home and do my
hair.

CARTER

Hey, Dan, want to grab a beer?
38.

DAN
I have to go have dinner with my
family.
(joking)
You want to have dinner with my
family?

CARTER
(quickly)
Sure! That would be great! Thanks
a lot! Just let me get my stuff
together.

DAN
Hey, wait --

But Carter is already off. Dan is surprised and annoyed that
Carter is taking him up on his mock offer.
EXT. DAN’S HOUSE, SUBURBS - NIGHT

Carter’s unwashed, dented Porsche pulls up to the house.
Carter has a lead foot on the brakes.

DAN

Who taught you how to drive?
CARTER

Uh, no one,
DAN

No kidding.

INT. DAN’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Ann comes out from the kitchen as Dan and Carter come in.

CARTER
Now this is a house! I mean, like
a home-type house, you know what I
mean?

DAN
Yes. Sweetheart, this is Carter
Duryea from the office.

ANN
(fake smile)
Oh. Hello. Nice to meet you.
39.

CARTER
Hi, Mrs. Foreman. Thanks so much
for having me in your home.

Carter HUGS Ann, who is taken by surprise.

ANN
Uhh -- You're very welcome. I hope
you like baked ziti.

CARTER
I love baked ziti. Baked ziti.
Exactly! That is exactly what I
need. Fantastic. Home cooking.
Awesome.

INT. DAN‘’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ann and Dan are in the kitchen.

ANN
Is there something wrong with him?

DAN
Clearly. Let’s just feed him and
get him the hell out of here.

ANN
He really is young. At least, a
lot younger than you.

DAN
Thanks for that.

ANN
I did the numbers on NYU today. Do
you know how expensive that school
is? Plus living expenses. Plus
Jana‘s oxthodonture. Plus baby

costs.
DAN
Hey, don’t worry about it.
ANN
That’s not actually a solution to a
problem: “Don’t worry about it.” I

think we might have to take out a
second mortgage.
40.

DAN
Maybe I should go into the living
room and ask my boss for a raise.

INT. DAN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Carter is looking at framed family photos on the mantle. He
stares at the happy photographs, his expression is as if he’s
trying to decipher runes.

Alex comes down the stairs, followed by Jana.
Alex stops short.

CARTER
Oh, hi! TI was just looking at you
in these photographs, and you were,
you've -~ I never actually
introduced myself in the elevator.
I’m Carter Duryea -~

ALEX
I know who you are. Does my Dad
know you're here?

CARTER
Your Dad invited me for dinner.
Technically.

JANA
Who‘s this?

ALEX

This is Dad‘s new boss.

JANA
You can’t be Dad’s new boss.
You’re too young.

ALEX
He’s also “scared shitless”.
CARTER
Hey. Good memory.
JANA
Plus you’re too cute to be Dad’s
boss.
CARTER

Really? Thanks.
41.

The PHONE RINGS.
JANA
(yells)
I‘VE GOT IT!
She RUNS UPSTAIRS to answer, leaving Alex and Carter alone.

CARTER
So, how's it going?

Alex looks at him like he’s weird.

ALEX
I‘m okay. What are you doing here,
really?

CARTER

Really? My wife left me, and
today’s the anniversary of our
first date, and I found the idea of
going home to my house to be too
depressing, so I sort of leeched
ento your Dad and invited myself
over.

ALEX
...You‘re sort of a bizarrely
honest guy, hunh?

CARTER
Not really. Just with you, for
some reason. Most people would
probably say I’m an anal-retentive,
emotionally guarded asshole.

The two of them stand there a moment.
ALEX
(pause)
You want to play foosball?

CARTER
Okay.

ALEX
Okay. Just let me...change.

INT. DAN’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ann is opening the oven.
Dan GRABS

42.

DAN
You think Alex can cope with living
in New York on her own?

ANN
T’m less worried about her coping
with it than I am about you.

DAN
Yeah, frankly I'd rather keep her
under house arrest with a homing
device on her ankle.

ANN
So then why’d you agree to it
without even talking to me? And
why is your teenage boss here? And
why de I feel so nauseous -- I
hardiy had any morning sickness the
first two times! I’m sick of it!

DAN
Alright, alright, calm down...let
me get that --
THE HOT CASSEROLE DISH with his BARE HANDS --

DAN
OWW! SHIT!

He DROPS THE CASSEROLE, SHATTERING IT on the floor, splashing
tomato sauce on his pants.

Ann just looks at him. Then she leans over to be sick in the

sink.

INT. DAN’S HOUSE, GARAGE - NIGHT

Alex is kicking Carter’s ass at FOOSBALL.

ALEX
I’m just not that into tennis
anymore, and what I’m really not
into is being “the tennis jock,”
you know? It’s like people don’t
even invite me to parties because
they think I’m in training. Also
there's this rumor going around
that I’m a lesbian.
43.

CARTER
That sucks. I mean -- not being a
lesbian, but --

ALEX

Well, I'm not.
(she smashes the ball)

It would be one thing if I was
going to go pro and make a ton of
money, but I'm not at that level.
I've played girls who are that
level, and I’m not. Not that I'd
want to be, really. Their lives
have peaked by the time they’re
like twenty-one.

Carter retrieves the ball.
CARTER
Sometimes I wonder if my life has
peaked at 26. If it’s all downhill
from here.

ALEX
It probably is.

CARTER
Yeah, probably.
INT. DAN'’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dan is at the door, paying a pizza delivery guy-

DAN
Thanks. Keep the change.

He closes the door with his foot.

DAN
(calls upstairs)
DINNER’S READY.

JANA
(from upstairs)
I’M ON AN IMPORTANT CALL.

DAN
WITH WHO?

JANA
MY BOYFRIEND.
44,

DAN 7
Your what?

Dan puts down the pizzas, picks up the phone.

DAN

Hi, this is Mr. Foreman. Who is
this, and how old are you?

(pause)
Alright, Will, I just wanted to say
that if you ever give my daughter
an alcoholic beverage or a joint, I
will hunt you down and neuter you.

JANA
DAD!!!

Dan hangs up.
DAN
DINNER‘S READY.
INT. DAN’S HOUSE, GARAGE - NIGHT
Dan comes into the rec room. Sees Carter and Alex RALLYING.
DAN
There you are. You kids ready to

come inside for dinner?

Dan pauses, realizing he’s just called his boss a “kid”, to
his face.

Alex and Carter look at each other.

INT. DAN'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A family tableau. Everyone talking and eating at the same
time.

CARTER
Mmm. Great pizza. Where'd you get
it?

ANN

It's from a wonderful little
Italian restaurant called Dominoes.

JANA
So are you really Dad’s boss? woot
45.

CARTER
(swallows, glances at Dan)
We're more -- colleagues.

DAN
(takes another slice)
That’s not true. He’s the boss
man. I'm the wing man.

JANA
Are you married? You’re wearing a
wedding ring.

CARTER
Yeah. Sort of. Yes. Yes.

JANA
So you're like...prematurely old.

ANN
Jana, would you pass the pizza?

CARTER
I've got it.

Carter REACHES FOR THE PIZZA at the same time as Jana,
KNOCKING OVER A SODA. It SPILLS ONTO DAN‘S LAP.

DAN
DAMMIT!

CARTER
Sorry!

DAN

That’s okay. Never mind.

CARTER
Let me --

Carter tries to WIPE DAN'S LAP with his napkin.

DAN
Carter, only my wife is allowed to
touch me there. Now excuse me. I
have to change my pants. Again.

Dan leaves the dining room. Carter smiles sheepishly.
ALEX

(to Carter)
Good job.
46.

CARTER
Thanks.
INT. DAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carter is leaving the house, waving goodbye. Dan and Ann are
in the doorway.

CARTER
Bye, thank you so much, that was a
great dinner! ‘Terrific pepperoni.

ANN
You’re very welcome.

DAN
Goodbye. Go home.

Dan shuts the door.

EXT. DAN‘S HOUSE, SUBURBS - NIGHT
CARTER
(to the shut door)
Thanks again.

Carter turns, goes back to his car.
Behind him, ALEX IS WATCHING HIM from the window. He glances
back over his shoulder, and she DUCKS BEHIND THE DRAPE.
INT. DAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alex looks a little puzzled with herself. Shé looks again,
as...
EXT. DAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carter pulls out jerkily from the house.

INT. CARTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Carter stands in his empty living room. He tips a table lamp
gently, balancing it until it falls off the table.
47.

EXT. NYU DORM HIGH-RISE - DAY

Alex moves into her dorm. Dan unloads her stuff out of his
station wagon.

EXT. TRIBECA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A couple of movers help Carter move into his new apartment.

INT. ALEX'S DORM - DAY

Dan carries a box past a POSTER OF A CANNABIS LEAF on another
student's door. He frowns.

EXT. NYU DORM HIGH-RISE - DAY

Alex walks Dan out to his car. The two of them HUG.

DAN
Here’s some pepper spray.

Dan hands her some pepper spray on a chain.

ALEX
Thanks, that's sweet.

DAN
Oh, and I’ve installed surveillance
devices throughout the dorm so I
can tell if you're doing anything
bad,

ALEX
Okay.

DAN
Okay. Be careful.

Dan turns his face away, hiding his emotion, and quickly gets
into his car.

EXT. BANK - DAY

Ann and Dan walk into a bank MORTGAGE LOAN office.
48.

INT. BANK - DAY

Dan and Ann are in the BANK LOAN OFFICE, filling out forms
for a second mortgage.

LOAN OFFICER
Sign here, here, and here, and
you’ve got your second mortgage.
Dan looks at Ann. She smiles at him, a bit ruefully.

Dan SIGNS.

INT. DIVORCE LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

Carter SIGNS papers.

Carter is sitting in a LAWYER’S OFFICE, filling out forms for

his divorce.

DIVORCE LAWYER
Sign there, there...and there. And
it's official...

Carter FINISHES SIGNING.

DIVORCE LAWYER
You're divorced.

INT. DAN'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
Carter is in Dan’s office.

CARTER
Alright, two things. First,
Steckle wants to organize a company
basketball league. I’m captain of
the sales team. You’re power
forward. Second, I heard you're
taking the Rums of Jamaica guys to
a Knicks game on Wednesday night.
You should have run that by me.

DAN
Run it by you? They‘re my clients.

CARTER
No, they’re GlobeCom clients. So
we're taking them to the Globecom
luxury suite.
49.

DAN
These aren’t luxury suite kind of
guys.

CARTER

Dan, everyone is a luxury suite
kind of guy. The suite’s being
used on Wednesday -- Teddy K's
hosting Bill Clinton, Jay-Z and
Kofi Annan -- so we'll take them to
a concert on Thursday.

DAN
A concert?

CARTER
The thing is, we need to get them
to up their buy for this year by
eighteen pages. We have to start
kicking some ass here, or I have to
let some people go.

DAN
Why do you say “let them go?” They
don’t want to go. Why don’t you
just say “fire them?”

CARTER
Because it sounds better.
DAN
Not to the person getting fired it

doesn’t.

Carter looks at Dan.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

The lights on the marquee read TONIGHT: LEGALLY DEDD.

INT. LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT

A well-stocked corporate luxury suite, high above the concert
floor. Dan, Carter, Morty, Louie, and a couple of other
sales people shmooze their guests from Rums of Jamaica as
HARDCORE HIP-HOP PLAYS BENEATH THEM. A waitress in hip-hop
gear serves drinks.

CORWIN, mid-fifties, black, from Philadelphia, not Jamaica,
is the head ad buyer for Rums of Jamaica.
50.

CARTER
Apparently, he was shot twelve
times, and pronounced “legally
dead”, hence the name.

CORWIN
Someone should tell him it’s
spelled D-e-a-d.

DAN
They're afraid to.

CARTER
He has a number one song out right
now. He's a protege of Fifty Cent.

DAN
Why don’t they call him “Nickel?”
CARTER
What?
CORWIN
(laughs)
In twenty years, your jokes haven’t
improved.
CARTER
Anyone want another rum and coke?
Corwin?
CORWIN

Nope, I’m okay. But I am glad it’s
all Jamaican rum.

CARTER
Oh, this is Petey from K-JAM
sneakers.

PETEY

I’m excited to talk to you about
the possibility of a cross—
promotion where if you buy a
certain amount of Jamaican rum, you
get a discount on running shoes.

CORWIN
Un-hunh...sounds like a great fit.
Get a lot of drunk people running
around. Hey, Dan, you want to go
get some air? .
51.

DAN
Sure. I’1l be back in a bit,
Carter.

CARTER

No problem. But don’t be too long,
we got chimichangas on the way!

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN SEATS - NIGHT
Dan and Corwin walk on the street outside MSG.

DAN
Sorry about this concert. They
wouldn‘t let me just get normal
seats for the Knicks game.

CORWIN
That's okay. Dan, I’ve been
instructed not to advertise in
Sports America any more.

DAN
(shocked)
What?

CORWIN
We were bought out last year by a
company called Continental Brands.
Apparently, the company that bought
us and the company that bought you
guys are having a feud over
wireless communications in Europe.

DAN
Wireless communications? What the
hell does that have to do with our
business?

CORWIN

Nothing. But we have this
corporate policy now. I just found
out about it, or I wouldn’t have
yanked your chain by coming here
tonight.

(sighs)
I'm sorry, Dan.
52.

INT. BAR NEAR MSG - NIGHT

Dan and Carter sit in a bar. Carter drinks beer. Dan drinks
scotch on the rocks.

The drink.

DAN
We'll get those ad pages back.
We'll just have to work a little
harder to fill ‘em.

CARTER
You don‘t get it. Steckle gave me
a bottom line. We had to increase
pages this quarter.

CARTER
..-Dan, I have to...I have to fire
Louie and Morty.

DAN
No you don’t.

CARTER
Yeah, I do. We’ve got Alicia,
Pete, and Harry on the Ford
account. So Morty is a logical
choice. And the new woman at Pepsi
thinks Louie’s a sexist, guess why?
He called her sugartits.

DAN
That idiot. Look, you can't fire
those guys. These are my guys.
They‘ve been with me for eight
years -- I hired them at the same
time.

CARTER
I know. That’s why they have big,
bloated salaries, that are not
commensurate with what they bring
in. I'm sorry.

DAN
(pause)
I've been here twenty-three years.
My salary’s higher than theirs.
Why don’t you just fire me?
53.

CARTER

(angry)
You want me to fire you Dan?
Because I could.

(heated)
You have a family that loves you.
You have a new kid on the way. I
look at you sometimes, and it’s
like...

(pause)
You have people who need you. You
really want to put them in jeopardy

Morty and Louie sit on Dan’s couch as Dan closes the blinds.

DAN
Guys, I feel...really terrible
about what I’m about to say,
but...I’m afraid you‘re both
being...let go.

LOUIE
Being let go? What does that mean?

DAN
It means...you’re fired. Believe
me, if I had any choice in the
matter...I just thought you should
hear it from me, because I’m the
one who hired you.

LOUIE
Wait a minute, are you getting
fired too?

DAN
...-No. This...this isn’t my
decision.

LOUIE

Oh, so...it’s not your decision so
you’re not to blame.

DAN
I didn't say that.

LOUIE
I can’t believe this. You were --
you were like a brother to me. I
would have stepped in front of a
bus for you, you piece of shit.
You know, you've become a real
corporate asshole.

DAN
Louie --

LOUIE
I tell you what, if you see my
friend Dan, tell him I was looking
for him.
55.

DAN
Louie!

Louie leaves. Dan looks shocked,

MORTY
Dan...what the hell am I going to
tell my wife? I mean...she already
wears the pants. Now she’s gonna
wear the tie and jacket too.

DAN
Morty...I‘m sorry.

Morty starts to cry.
MORTY

I know this must have been hard for
you. You were a good boss, Dan. I
mean it. You always treated
everyone with respect. And...well
I appreciate it.

How about you?
CARTER
I rented an apartment. In Tribeca.
ALEK
That‘’s awesome.

(pause)
Do you drink coffee?

No, usually I just hook up to an
Iv.

EXT. CAFE TABLE — DAY (LATER)

(WO EMPTY ESPRESSO CUPS sit next to the FULL ONE Carter is
nursing.

Carter is sitting with Alex at the cafe table, his leg
bouncing nervously.

ALEX
You sure can pound back the
caffeine. Is that why your leg is
shaking like that?
CARTER
I think it is.

ALEX
Your wedding ring’s gone.

CARTER
Uh, yeah. I am officially the
first guy from my high-school class
to get a divorce.

ALEX
Oh. Sorry.

CARTER
That's okay. If I look at it
honestly, it’s been coming since...
pretty much our second date. So
umm..-how’s school?

ALEX

Pretty good!

(pause, less upbeat)
Pretty good. I mean, it’s sort of
hard to get to know people, coming
in as a transfer. Everybody has
already joined their clique and
they’re not sure if they can admit
one more. My creative writing
classes are cool, though.

CARTER
Creative writing, hunh?

ALEX
Yeah, I guess I've always been
interested in stories. Escaping
into someone else’s life. Because
mine seemed pretty boring. I’m
cursed with a functional family.
Of course writing isn’t exactly
practical, so I’m thinking of
getting a double major in business.

CARTER
Oh, man, don’t do that. Stick with
writing.

ALEX
You know, sometimes you seem sort
of bummed out with your career or
something, which is weird because
you‘re so successful.

57.
58.

CARTER
No, I‘m not bummed out. It’s
pretty much what I have in life,
you know, my career. That and a
dented Porsche.

ALEX
Well your family must be really
proud of you.

CARTER

(shrugs)
My mom is, maybe, I don‘t know.
She was sort of a hippy, so she’s
not so into the corporate stuff.
And my dad left home when I was
four, so...I don’t know the guy.
His parents had money, but he was
this “artist”, in quotes, he was
kind of a druggy, he was in this
cult for a while-- hey, let’s get
out of here, you want to maybe...go
for a walk or something? Now that
you know my entire life story?

ALEX
Sure, but there’s not much left to
talk about.
She smiles at him. He smiles, enjoying being kidded.

Carter laughs nervously.

ALEX
Umm...SO..-

CARTER
So...yeah...I heard this...this
rumor that alcohol impairs your
judgement --

She starts UNBUTTONING CARTER'S SHIRT.

CARTER

ALEX

Yes?

CARTER

CARTER
Jeez, you gonna be okay?

DAN
I'll be fine. What's that guy
doing here? He's one of the moving
men.

Dan nods to a 6'6” guy who’s on Steckle‘s team. The moving
man DUNKS.

CARTER
I guess Steckle recruited him for
the corporate VP team.

DAN
Well that's fair.

STECKLE
I’m sorry, who are you?

CARTER
Mark, this is Dan Foreman. Dan
just closed the Toys R Us deal.

DAN
Carter’s being modest, he did most
of the work.

STECKLE
That’s beautiful, maybe you two
should get a room.
Dan’s face gets red.

STECKLE
You pussies ready to be schooled?

Carter tries to laugh it off as Steckle dribbles away. Dan
looks pissed.

THE GAME STARTS.

Steckle and Dan match up.

The 6’6” moving man is a ringer. But so’s Dan. The moving
man dominates inside, while Dan knocks down outside shots.
Steckle gets more and more pissed, as Dan takes him to
school. The big man starts to double-team Dan.

Dan BANGS down underneath the basket, GRABBING A REBOUND, and
is REJECTED by the big moving man. The VP TEAM CHEERS.

STECKLE
(in Dan's face)
YEEAAAH! Not in my house!

A look of annoyance at Steckle crosses Carter's face.
67.

At the other end, Steckle passes to the big man. Dan goes to
double team him, and he passes back to Steckle who hits an
EASY LAYUP.

STECKLE
Sweetness! You can’t guard me!

Dan swallows his anger.

Next trip upcourt, Dan gets double teamed. He makes a neat
pass to Carter, who makes an open layup.

CARTER
Yes!

Carter and Dan share a moment, pointing at each other across
the court.

DAN
(to Theo)
I'll take big man.

Next trip down the court, Dan guards the big guy. He is UP
IN HIS JOCKSTRAP, keeping within a foot of him at all times.

6'6” MOVING MAN
Hey, ease up old man, don’t have a
heart attack.

DAN
What’s the matter, big man, can’t
take a little D?

Dan KNOCKS a pass away from him. At the other end, Dan gets
the ball back on a pass, starts to SHOOT when Steckle
BLOCKS/FOULS him.

STECKLE
RE-JEC-TION!

Dan glares at Steckle.

The VP team runs upcourt. Steckle STREAKS DOWN THE COURT,
going up for an EASY LAYUP, when Dan RUNS UP from out of
nowhere, BLOCKING THE SHOT.

DAN
Not in my house.

Dan sprints down to the other end, catching a pass and going
for THE DUNK.

Dan's team cheers.
68.

BALANCE.

Dan COMES DOWN AWKWARDLY, SLAMMING into the court.

He had a friend, but...he ate him.
How’s your shoulder?

DAN
Keeps popping out. You mind?
(Carter nods)
Tell me something, when you were
eighteen, did you ever return your
parents’ phone calls?

CARTER
Uh, well, they never called, but I
guess I would have.

DAN
My older daughter won’t call me
back. I feel like going to NYU and
kidnapping her, so I can stop
worrying about her.

CARTER

Well, that, that sounds like a not
great idea. Anyway, Alex seems --
from the very brief time I met her -
- to be pretty savvy.

(in a reverie)
I wouldn‘t worry about her too
much. She’s a terrific, smart
woman. Girl. Young lady.
whatever. My point is, she can
handle herself.

(pause)
You seem to have a really great
marriage...How do you do it?

DAN
You just pick the right one to be
in the foxhole with. And then...

Dan sits down on a bench. Takes off his tie. He looks
shattered.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET — DAY

Carter walks towards NYU, his eye blossoming purple.

INT. ALEX'S DORM ROOM - DAY
Carter comes in. Alex and her roommate are there.
ALEX’S ROOMMATE
Hey, Carter, wow, that’s some
shiner.

ALEX
Could we have some privacy, Maya?

ALEX’S ROOMMATE
Sure. Absolutely.

The roommate leaves.

ALEX
Have a seat. You want some ice for
that?

CARTER

Yes, please.
Alex goes to a mini-fridge.

ALEX
Umm, we don't have any ice left.
But here, this soda‘s cold.

She hands Carter a cold soda, which he puts on his eye.

CARTER
So, umm...sorry about my timing
there, with uh...the L word. It
just sort of slipped out. But I’ve
been thinking about it a lot, and
that’s how I feel.

ALEX
Umm -- that’s really sweet.
81.

CARTER
I mean it.

ALEX
I know you probably think you do.
But I’ve been thinking too, and I'm
-- I'm doing a double major.

CARTER
(nodding)
Yeah...
ALEX

And I’m taking anthropology classes
on top of that. I've got a lot

going on.

CARTER
Yeah...absolutely...

ALEX
I’m not really ready for a big
commitment.

Carter tries to play it off like something positive.

CARTER
Yes. Absolutely. That‘s what I'm
talking about. Look, when I said I
loved you I didn’t mean that I
wanted to...interfere with your
classes, I mean...I’m not talking
about marriage or anything. Yet.

ALEX
Carter, I’ve had a great time, and
I think you’re a really great guy,
but...You’re on the rebound.

CARTER
I‘m not.

ALEX
It wasn’t all that long ago that
your wife left you.

CARTER
That was the best thing that ever
happened to me.
82.

ALEX
Well...good. But then it’s a good
thing whether you're with me or
not. And I...I think we should stop
seeing each other.

Carter assumes the same cajoling expression he had when Kim
left him.

CARTER
Alex. Aleeex...

Alex looks Carter in the eyes. She looks open, vulnerable.
The look freezes Carter. He drops the sell job he had been
trying to do.

CARTER
I just want to tell you...
(beat)
I’ve enjoyed talking to you more
than pretty much anyone in my
entire life.

ALEX
(swallows )
Thank you...Me too.
Carter nods.
Turns and leaves Alex's dorm room. The sound of the door
opening transitions us to...
INT. DAN’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dan comes into the living room, looking exhausted.
Jana comes down from the top of the stairs.
JANA
Dad?! Where have you been? Your
cell phone was off.
DAN
Why? What is it?
(beat)
Where’s mom?

EXT. SUBURBAN HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Dan and Jana park Dan’s Volvo.
83.

Dan RUNS out, ahead of Jana, SLAMMING the car door behind
him.

INT. ANN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Dan comes in, finds Ann lying peacefully in a hospital bed.

ANN
There you are.

DAN
You okay?

ANN
I'm fine. The baby’s fine. I hada
little scare. There was some
bleeding.

DAN
What was it?

ANN
A uterine tear. It sounds bad, but
it's okay. I just need some rest.
Dan controls himself.

DAN
Sorry. I’m just glad you’re okay.

He wipes his eyes.
DAN
I just...I don't know what the hell
I would do if anything ever
happened to you. I think I would
pack it in.
ANN
Well, I’m afraid you're gonna be
stuck with me for a while.
She kisses his hand.

For the first time that day, Dan becomes calm.

INT. ANN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
Late at night. Dan sits by Ann‘s bed as she sleeps.

The door opens, and Alex comes in.
84.

She looks at her mom.

ALEX
Is she okay?

DAN
(whispers)
Yeah. Sleeping.

He puts his finger over his lips. Gets up.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dan and Alex sit in a small waiting area. Dan has a paper
cup of coffee.

ALEX
I broke up with Carter.
DAN
Why? Because of me?
ALEX
No. Because of me. Anyway, I’m
sorry.
DAN
For what?
ALEX
Lying to you. Hiding stuff from
you,

Dan picks at the lid of the coffee cup.

ALEX
I should tell you, Carter didn‘t
seduce me. If anything, it was the
other way around.

DAN
Please, I don’t need the details --
(beat)
Unless, I mean, you want to tell
me.
ALEX

Uh, no. Not particularly.

DAN
Good.
85.

ALEX
You probably think I'm disgusting.

DAN
Disgusting? Why on earth would I
think that?

ALEX
«-I didn’t know you took out a
second mortgage. I don’t have to
go to NYU. SUNY’s fine.

DAN
No --

ALEX
Its fine.

DAN

(firm)
No. You're staying at NYU...

Dan gathers himself.

DAN
Look, Alex, you’re a...a smart
woman. You can handle yourself.
And what I'm saying is...I‘m going
to try, okay? To...be whatever
kind of father I should now be for
you. I’m not saying I can pull it
off, but...I’'m gonna try and...
adjust.

ALEX
(touched)
Dad...you don’t have to change.

DAN
Yeah...I do.

Dan pats her on the shoulder.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

High angle shot on the city. Taxis, buses, people going by
from skyscraper perspective.
86.

INT. ASSISTANTS’ DESKS - DAY

Three computer screens pop to "TEDDY K. IS COMING”, one after
the other.

A saleswoman reacts with surprise as Teddy K's jovial face
pops onto her screen.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Moving men lift out the table.
They set up the room. Plug stuff in. Set up a podium.

Steckle appears. Greets some of Teddy K’s staff. More and
more people fill the space.

INT. HUGE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

About a HUNDRED-FIFTY PEOPLE are JAMMED into the room,
including Theo, Alicia and the remaining sales staff.

TEDDY K emerges from the elevator bank, with his beautiful,
somewhat robotic assistant at his side. It’s hard to tell
how old he is. He could be a mature-looking 40, or a young-
looking 60.

The crowd parts before him, staring, amazed, at the great
man.

Teddy is naturally charming, working the room.

TEDDY K.
Hil How are ya! Good to see ya!
(to secretary)
Nice brooch!
(joking to assistant)
We must be paying her too much
money !

Teddy moves into the conference room, SHAKING PEOPLE’S HANDS,
GIVING HIGH-FIVES.

TEDDY K.
(greeting people)
Hi, hi, how are you, hi.

Teddy's assistant whispers in his ear as he approaches
Steckle.
87.

TEDDY K‘S ASSISTANT
(in Teddy’s ear)
Mark Steckle.

TEDDY K.
(smiles at Steckle)
Mark Steckle! How are ya?!
Steckle beams.

STECKLE
Hi, Teddy!

TEDDY K.
How ya doin?

STECKLE
Very psyched!

Steckle leads him through the crowd, stopping by Carter.

STECKLE
Oh, this is Carter Duryea.
TEDDY K.
Oh, yes, cell phones.
CARTER
Thanks! I’m with Sports America
now.
TEDDY K.
That's the flagship.
(pauses)

What happened to your eye?

STECKLE
Yeah, what did happen?

All eyes are on Carter.

CARTER
Oh, I...fell asleep at my computer.
(mimes it)
Bang. Right on the monitor.
TEDDY K.
Well...those things can be
dangerous!

Teddy laughs, which is the cue for everyone else to laugh!
88.

TEDDY kK.
Well keep up the good work! Keep
in touch!

Teddy K. gives Carter the thumbs up sign, and moves on.

STECKLE
(whispers to Carter)
I wouldn't be surprised if he
announces another takeover today.

Teddy stands at a podium. He looks out at the crowd, as
everyone settles in their seats.

TEDDY K.
Synergy.

The room lights go down. Teddy is bathed in the blue glow
from a rear~projected Globecom logo behind him.

Carter looks over to see Dan, who comes out of the elevator.
He is in yesterday’s clothes, having spent the night at the
hospital.

TEDDY K.
What exactly does it mean? Why
does a business swim with it, and
sink without it, in this new ocean
of megabytes, streaming video, and
satellites?

Dan makes his way into the crowd.

TEDDY K.
There are vast differences between
us. On a person to person level,
on a national level, on a global
level. Every day, the world
becomes more complex.

The crowd gazes at Teddy, mesmerized.

TEDDY K.
And to survive in a complex world,
we need complex bonds to interface
with it.

The audience hangs on his words. Dan watches him with
narrowed eyes.

TEDDY K.
What we're. building here. Is it a
company, or is it an economy?
(MORE)
TEDDY K. (cont'd)
Is it a new country, with no_
national boundaries, a new
democracy of the consumer? A new
democracy with a new electorate.
Twenty-four hour music videos in
Kuala Lumpur. Computers with
parts manufactured in Japan,

Greenland, Idaho and India. A soft-

drink ad going out simultaneously

to seven continents? The Dalai

Llama eating Krispity Krunch while

uploading prayers onto the net?
(pauses)

In this room. In this room, I see

this.

Teddy K. Holds up his hands, FINGERS EXTENDED.
TEDDY K.

What we're trying to get to is
this.

89.

Wiggles them.

Teddy K, INTERLACES HIS FINGERS, mimicking the GLOBECOM

CORPORATE LOGO.

TEDDY K.

(smiles)
This is unbreakable. This is
inevitable. Woman‘’s World
magazine. Why not a Woman’s World
channel? Across the world.
Computers. Why not a weekly
computers section in Sports America
magazine?

Someone in the audience LAUGHS.
It’s Dan.
All heads turn towards him.

He looks a little surprised at himself.

DAN
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
TEDDY K.
(puzzled)

Yes?

There is murmuring in crowd.
90.

DAN
I‘m sorry. My uh...My name’s Dan
Foreman. I...I work for Sports
America...and...I’m not sure I
understand what you're talking
about.

Carter looks at Dan, shocked.
Dan proceeds, tentatively.

DAN
What I mean is, what do computers
have to do with sports? Are you
literally saying there should be a
section in the magazine about
computers? Who’s going to want to
read that?

Steckle shoots Dan a look of DEEP HATRED.

DAN
And I'm not sure I understand how
the way the world is changing is
actually going to change how we do
business. I mean, we still are
selling a product which someone
hopefully needs, right? We're
still just human beings, with other
human beings as customers.

Dan picks up steam.

DAN

And I can't see how this company is
like its own country. I mean, just
because we sell all different kinds
of things, that doesn’t mean we
should operate by our own laws,
does it? Besides which, countries,
at least democratic ones, have some
obligations to their citizens,
don't they? So how doe layoffs and
bottom-line thinking fit into that?

There is a long pause.

TEDDY K.
.».-Dan Foreman.

Teddy nods gravely.
gl.

TEDDY K.

+..Sports America...you ask some

excellent questions.
(nods)

Some excellent, excellent

questions.

(mulling it over)

I’m glad you asked them.
(pause)

And I‘m leaving it to you...
(gazes at the crowd
sternly)

«+.to all of you, to answer them.

And now, unfortunately...

(to his assistant)

Absolutely.

Teddy K. LEAVES THE ROOM, followed by his assistant.
There is a pause. Everyone is silent.
Then Steckle starts APPLAUDING TEDDY kK.

STECKLE
YEAH! TEDDY K!

Everyone else in the room JOINS HIM in applauding.

STECKLE
TEDDY Kit!

Dan walks out through the back of the crowd, who are all
facing away from him, towards the departing Teddy K.

INT. DAN‘S OFFICE - DAY
Dan sits behind his desk. Carter comes in.

CARTER
Oh my God. Oh my God, Dan.

Steckle comes in.

STECKLE
Good, you’re both in here.
(points at Carter)
You I‘11 deal with in a second.
(to Dan)
You. Have you lost your frigging
mind?
92.

DAN
Well, he...he said they were
excellent questions.

CARTER
Dan -~

STECKLE

Okay, you think this is funny. You
think it’s funny to disrespect a
great man. Do you know who you
were talking to just now? Teddy K!
TEDDY K, GODAMMIT!

(pause)
Look, we‘ve been carrying your fat,
bloated salary for way too long. I
want you out of this building
within the next ten minutes. Now
I’m gonna go to my office and smoke
a nice cuban cigar, and try to
forget you ever existed.

(to Carter)
In my office. Now.

Steckle turns to go.

CARTER
Mark...Don‘t fire him.

STECKLE
Excuse me?

CARTER
He busts his ass, Mark...and...

STECKLE
(aggressive)
And?

CARTER
Nothing.

Dan looks down, embarrassed and defeated.
| CARTER
Just...if you fire him...
(pause)
You have to fire me too.

Dan looks at Carter, surprised.
93.

STECKLE

---I’m sorry. Let me get something
straight. You’re throwing yourself
in with him? With this useless,
over the hill loser? Think here,
think what you're doing, because if
you're not careful, you're gonna
end up like him.

CARTER
I guess...I guess...that would be
okay.

STECKLE
(beat)
Alright. Then you’re fired too,
you little shit.

CARTER
»+.That’s too bad, because...you're
going to lose a huge client Dan and
I were working on. It was going to
save the year for us. Without it,
Magazine’s pretty deep in the red.

STECKLE
Oh yeah? What client is that?

Pause. Carter glances at Dan. Dan looks at Steckle.

DAN
+..You think we’re going to tell
you?

Steckle stares at Dan.

STECKLE
...You're bluffing.

DAN
I don‘t bluff...I’m not that good a
salesman.

STECKLE
(beat)
Okay, well I don't give a crap.

CARTER
I think Teddy K. will. See, I’m
gonna call him, and tell him you
drove his most profitable magazine,
his flagship, into the ground. And
he’1l listen to me.

(MORE )
94.
CARTER (cont'd)
(beat)
He likes what I did with cell
phones.
Steckle looks from Carter to Dan. It's a standoff.
STECKLE
You have 24 hours. Or you're both
gone.
Steckle leaves.
CARTER
(beat)
Any ideas?
Dan thinks...
DAN
«--One.
EXT. PARKING LOT, KALB AUTOMOTIVE ~ DAY
Los Angeles.

Dan and Carter get out of their rental car.

Carter looks nervous. Dan smiles at him reassuringly.

EXT. BRIDGE, CORPORATE CAMPUS - DAY
Dan and Carter walk towards the Kalb Automotive building.
DAN
You got all your research?
{Carter nods)
Alright. Follow my lead.

He pats Carter on the arm.

INT. LARGE OFFICE - DAY
Dan hands a copy of SPORTS AMERICA to Morton Kalb.
DAN
Thought I’d bring you this in
person again.

KALB
Thanks. How are your daughters?
95.

DAN
They‘re great, thanks. And your
grandkids?

KALB
They’re fine. My son-in-law has my
oldest, Ralphie, enrolled ina
computer camp, whatever that is.

Carter approaches, laughing a little too loud. Kalb looks at
him as if noticing him for the first time.

DAN
I'd like to introduce my boss,
Carter Duryea.

KALB
Your boss? He looks more like your
nephew.

CARTER
Well I’ve...been learning a lot
from Dan.

KALB
What happened to your eye?

DAN
That's one of the things he’s
learned from me.

An uncomfortable pause. Carter tries to laugh this off.
KALB

Are you saying you punched him in
the eye? Why?

CARTER
We don’t really have to get into
this.

KALB

Please, I'm...rather curious.

DAN
(to Carter)
Why did I hit you?

Carter gives Dan a look. What the hell is Dan thinking?

DAN
(pauses, then shrugs)
+.-He called me a dinosaur.
(MORE)
DAN (cont'd)
Said I was out of date, and I'd
better step in line.

Dan looks at Carter. Carter’s eyes widen a touch.
Kalb looks surprised.

KALB
So you slugged him?

DAN
It was a fair fight.
{to Carter)
Right?

Carter picks up the ball.

CARTER

Right.

(taking out a folder)
Mr. Kalb, you have a truly
impressive business. I've been
looking inte all the details, new
franchise openings, market
awareness, customer demographics --

KALB
I’m sorry, you got into a fistfight
because he called you a dinosaur?

DAN
I don’t know what happened. I just
snapped. There’s only so much a
man can put up with.

KALB
Hunh. And...if you’re his boss,
why didn’t you fire him?

CARTER
(pause)
He’s my best salesman. Now I’ve
been looking at a cross-promotion
we could do with Krispity-Krunch --

DAN
(cuts him off)

Carter, that’s okay. Mr. Kalb, I
don’t want to go into facts and
figures right now. You know them
all anyway. Let me just ask you,
what's your hesitation about
advertising in the magazine?
97.

Kalb watches the two of them.

KALB
..-My hesitation is that our
advertising budget is already
overextended. My son-in-law spent
a lot of money on cable and on-
line, and, frankly, we’re not
getting the bang for the buck that
we hoped for. He wants to plow
more money into it, but...

DAN
++ But?

Kalb looks from Carter to Dan.

KALB
But he is such an asshole.

Kalb’s anger spills out.

KALB

I built this business, and I know

more about running it than he ever
“~ will. And I know that when I make

a mistake, it doesn’t pay to

retrench. I’m going to restructure

our whole advertising plan.

Starting with a major buy in your

magazine.

DAN
That’s great news, Mr. Kalb! Thank
you,

CARTER

Thank you so much!
: Dan and Kalb shake hands.

KALB
(to Carter)
i Oh, and...I don’t give a shit about
5 Krispity Krunch. Let's just stick
to the magazine.

 

Kalb walks Dan towards the door.

KALB

om (to Dan)
So you really slugged him?

i
i
98.

DAN
Yup.
(snaps his fingers)
Carter.

Carter follows him out.

EXT. BRIDGE, CORPORATE CAMPUS -— DAY
Dan and Carter arrive at the office.

CARTER
That was awesome! You were
amazing! I mean, that was
actually...fun!

DAN
(laughs)

What Kalb really needed was to see
an old fart who beat the crap out
of a kid half his age. And you
know what the best thing is? It’s
the right thing for him to do.
It’s gonna improve his business.

CARTER
(stops)
+-.You actually...you actually
believe in this stuff, don’t you?

DAN
(stops)
Course I do. Why the hell else
would I do it?

Dan walks off down the bridge, doing a little dance.

INT. SPORTS AMERICA OFFICE - DAY

Dan and Carter get off the elevator, still on a high. Alicia
sees them.

ALICIA
Dan, where have you been?!

DAN
We were in Los Angeles.

CARTER

Congratulations. So did Teddy k.
He sold the company! To Calcor
Communications!

CARTER

carter and Dan stand there, speechless.

INT. STECKLE'S OFFICE - DAY
Carter and Dan come in.

CARTER
Mark! What happened? I thought
you said Teddy K was going to buy
another company!

STECKLE
That‘s what they told me, but ~- he
sold us...I’m out.

CARTER
Wait, you’re out?

STECKLE
Yeah. They’re reorganizing the
whole place.
(to Carter)
You‘re out too.

Carter looks stunned.

STECKLE
(to Dan)
I think you’re in.
DAN
I‘m in what?
STECKLE
Your old job.
DAN
My old job? Running the
department?
STECKLE

That’s the rumor.

STECKLE (cont'd)

(he sits back, shattered)

The whole thing seems so arbitrary.

I feel used.
DAN

(pause)
Yeah. Kinda tough to know you’re
replaceable, hunh?
He looks at both of them.

DAN
I‘m sorry you lost your jobs.

MUSIC RISES.

EXT. TRIBECA APARTMENT - NIGHT
Carter sits on the street outside his apartment.

He thinks.

INT. DAN’S FIRST OFFICE - DAY

He has boxes cf his stuff piled in the middle of the room.

lost.

INT. DAN’S OFFICE - DAY

Dan is back in his old office. He stands as Carter comes in.

CARTER
Hi, Dan.

DAN
Carter. Come on in.

CARTER
Nice office.

DAN
Thanks. Have a seat.

Carter sits.

DAN
So. How have you been the last
month?

CARTER

I’ve been good, thanks. It’s
been...pretty strange not having to
get up and go into work in the
morning.

DAN

Yeah. Well that’s what I wanted to
talk to you about.

(pause)
I want to offer you a job. We
definitely...had our moments. But
I think you’re a good manager, and
a good salesman, and I'd like you
to come here and be my second in
command.

CARTER
(surprised)

Dan...I really appreciate that,
more than you know. And if I knew
this was what I wanted to do,
there’s no one I could learn more
from than you.

(MORE )
102.

CARTER (cont'd)

But I’m not sure what I want to do
for a living. I’m not sure I want
to work at a big place. I thought
I did. I thought I had everything
mapped out. But...I’m not really
sure what I want to do with my
life. I just know I want it to
mean something to me, like this
means something to you.

DAN
oh.
CARTER
Do you think I’m being stupid?
DAN
(pause)

»..No, I don’t. I think that
sounds right.

Carter nods.

He settles back.

Pause.

CARTER
So how's...the family?

DAN
Ann's good. Baby’s coming Tuesday
after next Tuesday. Caesarian.

CARTER

Wow. That’s amazing.

DAN
It sure is.
(pause)
And the girls...the girls are both
good.

CARTER
I'm glad. Please...give them all
my best.

Carter gets up.

DAN
Sc what are you going to do?

CARTER
I’ve saved up a bit of money, I’m
going to travel.
103.

DAN
That'll be fun.

Carter stands there for a moment.

CARTER
Umm. ..Dan...thanks.

DAN
«+-For what?

CARTER
For...I guess for showing me a few
things. No one ever took the time
to umm...give me a hard time
before. Or to teach me
anything...actually worth learning.
See, I never really had a...

Carter takes a breath.

He scowls a bit, FIGHTING BACK THE EMOTION which has snuck up
on him.

Dan looks down.

CARTER
---Sorry. You know what I’m
saying.

: DAN

Yeah. I do.

CARTER
.. Alright.

DAN

Listen, Carter. I want to tell you
something. You’re gonna be okay.

CARTER
You think so?
DAN
Yeah. I know it. You’re a good

man.

Carter stands there. It’s the first time he’s ever heard
this.

Carter goes over to Dan and HUGS him.

Dan awkwardly pats Carter on the back. Then he HUGS Carter.
They release the hug. Carter rubs his eye.

DAN
Don’t be a stranger.

They shake hands.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Carter steps out if the elevator and sees Morty waiting to

CARTER
Hey, Morty! You're back!
MORTY

delivery guy.
(turns)
Hey, do you know Dan’s daughter

Alex?

As some people move through Carter sees Alex approaching.

She's carrying her tennis gear.

CARTER
(shocked)
Oh -~ hi, yeah -- what are you --
what are you doing here?

ALEX
(shocked)
Oh -- I’m just...surprising my dad,
seeing if he wants to play
tennis...

MORTY

Alex is a fantastic tennis player.
She was a junior champ, right?

CARTER
Oh, really, you...you play tennis,
hunh?
ALEX
(smiles)

+.-Yeah. So, umm...how’s it going?

don't know. You...doing good?

ALEX
Yeah, I’m...just...working on some
short stories...

CARTER
That’s...that'’s great.

Morty looks from one to the other.
MORTY
Well, I got a raise! Dan got mea

because my wife just got laid off.
Timing’s everything in life, right?
Another elevator door opens. People get in.
MORTY (CONT'D)
(getting in elevator)
Take care, Carter!
CARTER
Yeah, you too, Morty. Nice
to...nice to see both of you again.

Carter runs in place.

At first, it is framed to look as if Carter is jogging on a

A cell phone rings.

CARTER
Hello? Hey, Dan! Oh my God!
That’s great! Got a name yet?
(beat)
That's fantastic. What?
(pause)
No, that's because I'm jogging.

Carter jogs away from the camera, revealing he is on a beach.
CARTER
No, I'm outside. I’m actually
jogging...outside.

Carter jogs off down the beach. His conversation continues
as music rises.

THE END.
