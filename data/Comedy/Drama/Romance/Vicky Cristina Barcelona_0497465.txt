VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA

by
Woody Allen
IRIS OUT TO:

EXT. BARCELONA AIRPORT - DAY
FS - The wall of the airport is a brightly colored mosaic.

Camera pans and dollies off the wall, to reveal CRISTINA and
VICKY, two young American women, who pull their bags away
from the front of the airport. Vicky is a thoughtful brunette
and Cristina is a beautiful free-spirited blonde.

Cristina and Vicky walk to a TAXI DRIVER standing beside a
taxi.

CRISTINA
Hi.

They stop as the taxi driver prepares to put their bags in
the trunk.

INT. TAXI - DAY

FS - Through the windshield as the taxi moves down a highway
to the city. Camera tilts up on a road sign, which reads:

“BARCELONA”

NARRATOR (V.0O.)
Vicky and Cristina decided to spend
the summer in Barcelona.

MCS - Vicky sitting in the rear passenger seat, looks out the
window at the passing countryside.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
Vicky was completing her master’s
in Catalan identity, which she had
become interested in through her
great affection for the
architecture of Gaudi.

DISSOLVE TO:

MCS - Cristina sits in the rear driver’s seat
NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
Cristina, who spent the last six
months writing, directing and
acting in a twelve-minute film,
which she then hated, had just
broken up with yet another
boyfriend, and longed for a change
of scenery.

She looks down thoughtfully.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
Everything fell into place when a
distant relative of Vicky’s family,
who lived in Barcelona, offered to
put both girls up for July and
August.

MCS - VICKY looks out the window at the countryside.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
The two best friends had been
close...

A SPLIT SCREEN slides in and shows Cristina sitting on the
other side of the taxi.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
...Since college and shared the
same tastes and opinions on most
matters. Yet, when it came to the
subject of love, it would be hard
to find two more dissimilar
viewpoints.

Vicky takes her cell phone out of her purse and dials a
number.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
Vicky had no tolerance for pain and
no lust for combat. She was
grounded and realistic. Her
requirements in a man were
seriousness and stability.

VICKY (OVERLAPPING)
(into cell phone)
Hi.
INT. DOUG’

S APARTMENT - NEW YORK - NIGHT

DOUG, Vicky’s businessman fiancée, lies under the covers of
his bed and talks into a cordless phone.

INT. TAXI

NARRATOR (V.0.)
She had become engaged to Doug
because he was decent and
successful...

DOUG (OVERLAPPING)
(into telephone)
--woke me up.
(chuckles)

- BARCELONA - DAY

Vicky talks into her cell phone.

Cristina,
wistfully.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...and understood the beauty of
commitment.

VICKY (OVERLAPPING)
(into cell phone)
Oh, well, I’m sorry, I know I woke
you. Yeah, I’m -- I miss you, too.

tugging at the ends of her hair, looks down

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Cristina, on the other hand,
expected something very different
out of love. She had reluctantly
accepted suffering as an inevitable
component of deep passion, and was
resigned to putting her feelings at
risk. If you asked her what it was
she was gambling her emotions on to
win, she would not have been able
to say. And that was exactly what
Vicky valued above all else.

EXT. NASH HOUSE - DAY

The taxi turns through a gate toward a large house.
INT. NASH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

Cristina follows Vicky into the living room. JUDY NASH walks
down the stairs.

VICKY
Hello.
(chuckling)
Hi.
JUDY
Oh, hello. Hi.
VICKY
Hi.
JUDY
(chuckling)

You’re Vicky.

VICKY
Yes, yes. Vicky.

Judy stops at the bottom of the stairs and shakes hands with
Vicky.
JUDY
(chuckles)
You’re so grown up.
VICKY

(chuckles)
Well, it’s been a while.

Judy kisses Vicky’s cheeks.

VICKY (cont’d)
It’s so great to see you.

JUDY
Well, welcome to Barcelona.

Cristina stops beside Judy, who looks at her.

CRISTINA
Hi. Cristina.

Judy shakes hands with Cristina.

JUDY
Oh, Cristina, I’m Judy.
CRISTINA
Hi.

INT. NASH HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

Judy leads Vicky and Cristina into a bedroom.

JUDY
This is your room.

VICKY
Oh, perfect, this is gorgeous.

CRISTINA
Wow, this house is so huge.

JUDY
I put you together.

EXT. NASH HOUSE - DAY

Vicky stands on the balcony outside the bedroom as Cristina
turns and gestures at Judy.

CRISTINA
Judy, thank you so much for having
me here...

Vicky steps to the railing and looks at the beautiful view of
the city.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
...because I know, you know, it’s
so last-minute and you don’t know
me at all and...

JUDY
No, I...

CRISTINA
...to include me is just so sweet
of you.

JUDY

But, I-I-I have to tell you, ah,
eh, it’s, it’s so nice to have a
little action around here. It’s
been so quiet since Arthur went off
to college, so it’s...
VICKY
Awww.

EXT. NASH HOUSE - LATER

A MAID, holding a tray, walks out of the house onto the
terrace to a table. Judy and MARK, her businessman husband,
sit on one side of the table and Cristina and Vicky sit on
the other side of the table. They are eating lunch.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
After the girls unpacked and Judy’s
husband, Mark, got home from the
golf course, lunch was served on
the terrace.

JUDY
We have a beautiful home, and,
yes...

MARK

Yeah, well, we’ve really come to
love it. It’s pretty nice here.

The maid stops at the end of the table and puts down the
tray.

JUDY
Well, he makes friends with anybody
and he speaks the language, so he
was like, “Whee!”
Vicky and Cristina chuckle.

MARK.
Well, you learned just fine.

The maid walks back toward the house.

MARK (cont’d)
So what do you do, Cristina?

Cristina leans back in her seat and looks at Mark.

CRISTINA

I am currently at liberty.
JUDY

Hm.
VICKY

Oh, come on. She, she made a film.
MARK
Mm.

JUDY
(gasps)
How exciting.

VICKY
Yeah.

CRISTINA
It was twelve minutes.

MARK
What was it about?

Vicky looks hesitantly at Mark.

CRISTINA
About? It was, uh, it was about why
love is so hard to define.

Mark smiles at Cristina.

MARK
(chuckles)
Wow, that’s a mighty big subject to
handle in twelve minutes.

Cristina chuckles. Vicky stares at Mark.
JUDY

Vicky...you’re, you’re getting your
master’s in something within--

VICKY
Yeah, my master’s in, uh, Catalan
identity.

JUDY
Ah, well.

MARK
What do you plan on doing with
that?

VICKY
Oh...

Vicky shrugs at Mark.
VICKY (cont’d)
..God, I don’t know, uh, maybe
teaching, maybe curating.

JUDY
Well...you don’t have to do
something, you know.

Judy glances at Mark.

JUDY (cont'd)
But she’s marrying this wonderful
man in the fall and all of her
conflicts will be resolved when he
makes her pregnant.

Judy, Cristina and Mark laugh.
VICKY
(chuckling)
Oh, well...
MARK
Well, now that Judy’s decided your
future...

Judy holds up her glass of wine.

JUDY
To, uh, your summer in Barcelona.
Welcome.

MARK
Salud.

Vicky and Cristina reach across the table and toast with Judy
her and Mark.

CRISTINA
Cheers.

VICKY
Salud. Salud.
EXT. BARCELONA STREETS - DAY

NARRATOR (V.0.)

Once, Mark and Judy invited Vicky

and Cristina to go sailing with

them...
EXT. BOAT - DAY

A CREWMAN sails the boat across the water. Vicky sits against
a railing and Judy is sitting on a deck chair.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...on Mark’s boat.

CHARLES, a handsome young businessman, and Cristina hold
glasses of wine and sit against a railing.
10.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
With Cristina in mind, Mark and
Judy asked along the son of one of
his business partners, an eligible
young man Mark thought she might
like.

CHARLES

My dad’s Mark’s partner. I work for
Dad. It’s basically investment
Management. Believe me, it’s not
too exciting. My dream is to
accumulate enough wealth and sail
off to an island somewhere and
spend the rest of my days
snorkeling.

(chuckles lightly)
I’m actually a snorkeling nut.

Cristina nods politely and raises her glass toward her mouth.

CHARLES (cont’d)
Have you ever snorkeled before?

Cristina shakes her head.

EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
The sailboat sails across the water.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Unfortunately, Charles and Cristina
were not a match made in heaven.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

A CHEF leads Vicky and gestures around the kitchen. KITCHEN
WORKERS are working around the kitchen.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Vicky, meanwhile, researched every
aspect of Catalan life, even
getting a tour of the market...

Vicky makes notes in a notebook as the chef lectures.
NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)

...and a local restaurant, to delve
into Catalan cooking.
11.

Vicky and Cristina sit at a table and look at the guitar
player.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
On balmy summer nights, the girls
would sometimes go to hear Spanish
guitar music, which never failed to
move Vicky in some magical way.

Camera dollies in on Vicky, who looks raptly at the guitar
player.

EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

A CROWD OF PEOPLE who stand around the gallery and look at
the exhibition. Vicky, Cristina and Judy stand by a wall of
paintings.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
One evening, Mark and Judy took
them to the opening of a friend’s
art gallery. Many local artists and
a number of collectors attended.

JUDY
Do you like them?

VICKY
I do. Thank you so much for taking
us.

JUDY

Well, you know, we buy from this
gallery. Mark has commissioned
this, this artist to do this series
of pictures...

VICKY
Mm-hm.

Cristina looks at someone 0.S.
JUDY

...for his office walls. Um...Yeah,
I think they’1l1 be beautiful.
12.

CRISTINA
Is that the artist over there?

Judy turns and looks 0.S.

JUDY
Where?
CRISTINA
In the red?
JUDY
Uh, no. No-no-no-no. That’s not....
No.
CRISTINA
Mm.
JUDY
Uh, Alfred is, um.... Oh, no, he’s

the gentleman in that, the linen
coat right there.

Vicky looks at the man 0.S.

CRISTINA
Oh.

JUDY
That’s him. Um...I, I don’t know
who that is.

Judy turns to Mark, who stands behind them looking at a
painting.

JUDY (cont’d)
Ah, Mark?

Mark turns toward Judy.

MARK
Yeah.

JUDY
Who is that gentleman in the red
shirt right over there? who is
that?

MARK
who?

Mark looks at the 0.S. man.
13.

JUDY
The, the gentleman in the red
shirt. Who is it?

MARK
Oh.

JUDY
Right there, who is it?

MARK
He’s a painter. Remember? Diego
told us about him? He had that
fiery relationship with that
beautiful woman who was nuts?

JUDY
Oh, my God.

MARK
With the violent fighting and...

Cristina glances at Mark and Judy.

JUDY
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
MARK.
Yeah, he had the, the messy
divorce.
JUDY

Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Cristina looks at 0.S. Juan Antonio.

MARK.
It was in all the newspapers.
(whispering)
Yeah, that’s him.

JUDY
Oh, it is.

Judy returns to Vicky and Cristina and Mark turns to talk to
some PEOPLE.

JUDY (cont’d)
Oh, my God. Um, his name is, uh,
Juan Antonio Gonzalo and he, uh, he
had this hot divorce and she tried
to kill him. Or he tried to kill
her.
14.

Cristina looks at Judy with amazement.

CRISTINA
What?

JUDY
I, it was this, like really big
thing in the art world. I can’t
remember the details...

Cristina looks at 0.S. Juan Antonio.

JUDY (cont’d)
...but he, you know, it, eh, well,
you know, we don’t move in those
bohemian...circles, so I don’t
know.

MFS - JUAN ANTONIO GONZALO, a handsome painter in a red

champagne.

EXT. BARCELONA STREETS - NIGHT
Some PEOPLE shoot off sparklers in the street
Vicky and Cristina walk down the street past a church.

gallery and decided to go for
dinner. They strolled past the

night air, while people
celebrated...

Vicky and Cristina walk out of frame.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Vicky and Cristina sit at a table at the restaurant. There
are plates of food in front of them.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...finally winding up around
midnight at a little restaurant.

CRISTINA
...Well, it’s just nice to be able
to not have to worry about if some
place is gonna stay open or...
15.

Cristina takes a pin out of her hair and lets it fall down
around her shoulders.

VICKY
Yeah, but you-- we probably should
be worrying about our, y’know,
dreams.

Cristina glances over her shoulder at someone 0O.S.
Vicky looks in the same direction, then looks at Cristina.

VICKY (cont’d)
What are you-- who-- who are you
looking at?

CRISTINA
Isn’t that the, uh...isn’t that the
painter that we just saw at the
gallery?

MS - Juan Antonio sits at a table with some PEOPLE.

VICKY
Oh, yeah, right. He’s the uh, the
painter with the bad divorce. Mark
told us. It was, I was half
listening.

Cristina, drinking from a glass of wine, looks at Vicky.

CRISTINA
He keeps looking over here.

VICKY
Well, that’s because you keep
provoking contact.
Cristina shakes her head.

CRISTINA
I’m not provoking contact.

VICKY
You are, you’ve been throwing
little looks at him all night.

CRISTINA
I’m just drinking my wine.

Vicky nods at Cristina.
16.

VICKY
Mm-hm. Yeah, of course you are.

Vicky glances at 0.S. Juan Antonio.

VICKY (cont’d)
Well, you, you must be doing
something because uh, he’s...

Juan Antonio stands up and walks across the restaurant.

VICKY (0.S.) (cont'd)
...coming over.

Juan Antonio stops at Vicky and Cristina’s table and looks at
the women.

JUAN ANTONIO
American?

CRISTINA
I’m Cristina and this is my friend,
Vicky.

Juan Antonio looks at Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO
What color are your eyes?

Cristina smiles at him. Vicky looks across the table at her
with disbelief.

CRISTINA
Uh...they’re blue.

JUAN ANTONIO
I would like to invite you both to
come with me to Oviedo.

VICKY
To come where?

JUAN ANTONIO
To Oviedo. For the weekend. We
leave in one hour.

CRISTINA
What, where is Oviedo?

JUAN ANTONIO
A very short flight.
17.

VICKY
By plane?

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

CRISTINA
What’s in Oviedo?

JUAN ANTONIO
I go to see a sculpture that is
very inspiring to me. A very
beautiful sculpture.

Juan Antonio nods at Vicky.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
You’11 love it.

Vicky gestures with disbelief.

CRISTINA
Oh.

VICKY
Oh, right, y-y-y-you’re asking us
to fly to Oviedo and back?

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm...no, we’ll spend the weekend. I
mean, I’1l1 show you around the city
and...we’1l eat well, we’1l drink
good wine, we’1ll make love.

Vicky stares at Juan Antonio as Cristina smiles.
VICKY
Yeah...who-who exactly is going to,
eh, make love?

JUAN ANTONIO
Hopefully, the three of us.

Cristina sighs.

VICKY
Oh, my God.

JUAN ANTONIO
I’1l get your bill.
18.

VICKY
Jesus, this guy, he doesn’t beat
around the bush. Look, senor, maybe
in a different life.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm? Why not? Life is short. Life
is dull. Life is full of pain. And
this is a chance for something

special.

VICKY
Right, well, who-who exactly are
you?

JUAN ANTONIO
I am Juan Antonio. And you are...
(to Vicky)
...Vicky...
(to Cristina)
...and you are Cristina. Right? Or
is it the other way around?

CRISTINA
Yeah, that’s right.

VICKY
Yeah, I mean, eh, you know, it
could be the other way around
because, frankly, it doesn’t matter
because either of us will do to
keep the bed warm. You know, I, I
get it.

JUAN ANTONIO
Well, you are both so lovely and
beautiful.

VICKY
Yeah, thank you, but we do not fly
off to make love with whoever
invites us to charming little
Spanish towns.

JUAN ANTONIO
(to Cristina)
Does she always analyze every
inspiration until each grain of
charm is...uh...como se dice, eh
squeezed out of it.
19.

CRISTINA
I guess I have to say that, um...My
eyes are green, actually.

VICKY
Oh, God, look, I wouldn’t call our
reluctance to leap at your sexual
offer being over-analytical. If you
would care to join us for some
recognized form of social
interaction, like a drink, then
we'd be fine, but otherwise, I
think you should try, you know,
offering to some other table.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm. what offended you about the
offer? Surely not that I find you
both beautiful and desirable.

VICKY
Offended me, no. It’s very amusing,
galling, to be honest, but, uh, the-

Vicky looks at Cristina, then checks her wristwatch.

VICKY (cont’d)
(to Cristina)
Is it my imagination or is it
getting a little late? Shall we go?

Cristina smiles at Juan Antonio.

CRISTINA
I would love to go to Oviedo.

Vicky looks at Cristina with disbelief.

VICKY
What? Are you kidding? Can we
discuss this?

Cristina shakes her head at Vicky.

CRISTINA
I think it would be so much fun. I
think we should go.
(to Juan Antonio)
I would love to go.

VICKY
Cristina, can we discuss this some
other time when--?
20.

JUAN ANTONIO
(to Cristina)
You know, when I saw you across the
room at the art gallery, I noticed
you have beautiful lips. Very full,
very sensual.

CRISTINA
Thank you.

VICKY
Okay, okay, look. I’m sure...You
know, if you wanna go--

CRISTINA
(to Juan Antonio)
Well, I can’t guarantee the
lovemaking because I happen to very
moody.

Juan Antonio shakes his head.

JUAN ANTONIO
Let’s not negotiate like a
contract. I came over here with no
subterfuge and presented my best
offer. Now I hope you will discuss
it and give me the pleasure to take
you with me to Oviedo. I have the
good fortune to borrow my friend’s
plane. It’s just big enough for the
three of us and I’m a very good
pilot.

VICKY
Right. Oh, it sounds very safe.

JUAN ANTONIO
Think it over.

Juan Antonio walks away from the table, leaving Vicky and
Cristina to discuss his proposition.

VICKY
I hope you’re joking about going.
CRISTINA
Oh my God, this guy is so
interesting.
VICKY

Interesting? Are you kidding?
What’s so interesting?
21.

VICKY(cont'd)
He wants to get us both into bed.
You know, but he’1l settle for
either. In this case, you.

Vicky sighs.

CRISTINA
Vicky, I’m a big girl, okay? If I
want to sleep with him, I will. If
not, I won’t.

VICKY
Cristina, he’s a total stranger
This is impulsive, even for you
and, if I heard right, he-he was
violent with his wife.

CRISTINA
Well at least he’s not one of those
factory-made zombies, you know? I
mean, this would be a great way to
get to know him.

VICKY
No it’s not. I’m not going to
Oviedo with this charmingly candid
wife beater, you know? You find his
aggressiveness attractive, but I
don’t. And he’s certainly not
handsome.

CRISTINA
Well I think he’s very handsome.
He’s got a great look. I mean
he’s, you know, he’s really sexy.

VICKY
Mm-hm. Well, you would, because
you’re, you know, you’re a
neurotic.

CRISTINA
Look, you got to admire his no-
bullshit approach.

VICKY
What are you talking about? It’s
all bullshit. I’m not going to
Oviedo. First off, I’ve never heard
of Oviedo. I don’t find him
winning. Third, even if I wasn’t
engaged and was free to have some
kind of dalliance with a Spaniard,
I wouldn’t pick this one.
22.

Vicky’s cell phone RINGS. Vicky pulls it out of her purse and
answers it.

VICKY (cont’d)

(into cell phone)
Hello? Hi. Oh, hi, I can’t talk
right now, I’m trying to save
Cristina from making a potentially
fatal mistake. What? No, the usual.
Yeah, I’1l call you back. I love
you, too.

CRISTINA
If we go back to the house now, we
can just throw some things in a bag
and then we’ll meet him there.
Look, I took an instant liking to
this guy. I mean, you know, he’s
not one of those cookie-cutter
molds, you know? He’s creative and
artistic.

VICKY
Cookie-cutter mold? What, what are
you-- Is that what you think of
Doug?

CRISTINA
Doug? Who said anything about Doug?

VICKY
It’s ridiculous. You like the way
it sounds to pick up and fly off in
an airplane.

CRISTINA
I know. I don’t know why I’m so
scared unless I’m scared of myself.
VICKY
It’s a mistake, Cristina.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
A small plane flies through a STORMY sky with LIGHTNING
FLASHING around it.
INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Juan Antonio flies the plane and Cristina sits in the
passenger seat beside him.
23.

JUAN ANTONIO
They predicted a little storm out
of town, out of Oviedo, but it’s
nothing serious. Don’t you worry.
Really. As you can see here...
There, it’s just, it’s just a
little bumpy, right?

Cristina looks over her shoulder and the camera pans slightly
to reveal Vicky, who sits in the back of the plane. She looks
around nervously.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
(to Cristina)
Would you like to fly it?

CRISTINA
Um, no thank you!

car. Try it.

Cristina, Juan Antonio and Vicky look up at a sculpture of
Christ on the cross.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...to see the sculpture that was so
meaningful to him.

CRISTINA
Are you very religious?

JUAN ANTONIO
No, no-no. No-no, I’m not. The
trick is to enjoy life, accepting
that it has no meaning whatsoever.

Cristina looks at Juan Antonio with disbelief.

CRISTINA
No meaning?

Vicky shakes her head and chuckles.

VICKY
Right.

CRISTINA
You don’t even think that authentic
love gives life meaning.

JUAN ANTONIO
Yes, but love is...so transient.
Isn’t it? I was in love with the
most incredible woman...and...and
in the end...

Juan Antonio shakes his head and chuckles lightly.

VICKY
Yes?

JUAN ANTONIO
(grunting sigh)
.she put a knife into me.

CRISTINA
My God, that’s terrible!
25.

Well, maybe you did something to
deserve it.

Vicky looks back up at the cross.

enjoyed hearing about the city and

JUAN ANTONIO
Here you are.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...and Juan Antonio was a little
drunk.

CRISTINA
Thank you.

JUAN ANTONIO
You are very welcome. All right.

Juan Antonio sits down.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Well, now that the day is almost
over, is it reasonable of me to ask
you...if you would both join me in
my room?

VICKY
Oh, come on. I thought we’d settled
that.
27.

CRISTINA
Vicky’s just trying to say that
she’s engaged to be married that’s
all.

VICKY
Uh-huh.

JUAN ANTONIO
Great. Then these are her last days
of freedom.

VICKY
No. Look, I’m not free. I’m
committed. You know what my theory
is? And when I drink, I get
brutally frank. I...I think that
you’re still hurting from the
failure of your marriage to Maria
Elena, and you’re trying to lose
yourself in empty sex.

JUAN ANTONIO
Empty sex? Do you have such a low
opinion of yourself?

CRISTINA
She’s just saying that it has to
have meaning for her, that’s all.

JUAN ANTONIO
I mean, the city is romantic. The
night is warm and balmy. We are
alive. Isn’t that meaning enough?

VICKY
Hey, look, I just came along to
keep Cristina company. I’m engaged
to be married. I have a handsome,
lovely fiance who I make love with,
and also holds a very real place in
my heart, and to be perfectly
frank, Juan Antonio, if I were the
type of person that played
around.... I don’t think it’s in
the cards for us.

Vicky slaps her hands together and picks up her jacket.

VICKY (cont’d)
So, I’m tired. I haven’t slept in
twenty-four hours and that is
exactly what I’m going to do.
28.

Vicky stands up and walks away.
Juan Antonio nods his head, then looks at Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO
And you?

CRISTINA
I’1l go to your room, but...you
have to seduce me.

INT. OVIEDO HOTEL/JUAN ANTONIO’S ROOM - NIGHT

Juan Antonio, holding a glass of wine, opens the door to
reveal Cristina, who stands in the hallway.

CRISTINA
Hello.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hello.

Cristina walks haltingly into the room as Juan Antonio closes
the door.

CRISTINA
I am just here to have a quick
drink to say thank you and then I’m
gonna go back to my room.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm. All right. Did you act in
the small film you made?

CRISTINA
Did I act?

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

CRISTINA
Yeah, I acted. why?

JUAN ANTONIO
Well, I hope you were more
convincing than you are when you
pretend to have come here for one
quick drink.

Cristina chuckles softly.
29.

CRISTINA
I am here to go to bed with you.
You’re right.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

CRISTINA
So you’re pretty much home free.
Unless you blow it.

JUAN ANTONIO
Blow it?

CRISTINA
Yeah.

JUAN ANTONIO
Blow it. You mean ruin the moment

CRISTINA
Yeah.

JUAN ANTONIO
Huh. And how would I do that?

CRISTINA
Um...I don’t know. It could be
anything from some inane comment
to...wearing the wrong kind of
shorts.

JUAN ANTONIO
Uh-huh.

CRISTINA
Although, somehow, by looking at
you, I think you’re wearing the
right kind of shorts.

Juan Antonio pours another glass of wine.

JUAN ANTONIO
You’re very hard to please.

CRISTINA
Yeah, well...I am famous for my
intolerance.

Juan Antonio hands her a glass of wine.

JUAN ANTONIO
Here.
30.

Cristina walks through the bedroom doorway. She sits down on
the end of the bed.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
And what do you want in life
besides a man with the right
shorts?

Cristina drinks from her glass of wine and shrugs at Juan
Antonio.

CRISTINA
I don’t know. I know I’m not gonna
settle till I...find what I’m
looking for.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hm. Which is what?

Juan Antonio sits down on the bed beside Cristina.

CRISTINA
Um...something...else. I want
something different. Something
more.

Juan Antonio reaches toward Cristina and gently caresses her
chin with his finger.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
Some sort of, um...counter-
intuitive love.

JUAN ANTONIO
Meaning?

CRISTINA
Meaning, um...

Cristina smiles at Juan Antonio, then shakes her head. He
continues to caress her chin and lips.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
(chuckles lightly)
I don’t know. I don’t know what I
want. I only know what I don’t
want. If you don’t start undressing
me soon, this is gonna turn into a
panel discussion.

Juan Antonio and Cristina lean toward one another and kiss.

Cristina suddenly leans back and looks down with distress.
31.

JUAN ANTONIO
What ha-- Are you, are you okay?

Cristina shakes her head.

CRISTINA
Yeah, I’m fine, I’m fine. It’s
something I ate.

JUAN ANTONIO
What’s wrong? Can I, can I get you
anything?

Cristina waves her hand at him.
CRISTINA

Um...no, I...I shouldn’t be
drinking. I--

 

Cristina hands her glass of wine to Juan Antonio.

JUAN ANTONIO
What happened?

CRISTINA
I’m gonna be sick.

Cristina stands up and hurries to the bathroom.

INT. OVIEDO HOTEL/VICKY & CRISTINA’S ROOM - DAY

Cristina sleeps in bed as a DOCTOR closes his medical bag.
Vicky stands beside her and Juan Antonio sits in the
background.

DOCTOR
It’s her ulcer and perhaps a little
food poisoning. Maybe both.

VICKY
Mm. God, both.

DOCTOR
She must just “ret.”

VICKY
Okay, “rest?”

DOCTOR
Not eat. Yeah, rest, rest.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
With Cristina stuck in bed, Vicky

Hi, is Doug there? Uh, oh, okay,
well, when he gets out of his
meeting, can you get him to call me
on my cell? Yeah, I’m still stuck

SANTA MARIA DEL NARANCO CHURCH - DAY

NARRATOR (V.0.)
But sightsee is what they did.

SANTA MARIA DEL NARANCO CHURCH - DAY
takes a cigarette out of his pack.

JUAN ANTONIO
I feel very sorry about Cristina.

VICKY
Oh, come on. Don’t pretend concern.
I’m sure that you kept encouraging
her to drink, as you did to both of
us throughout dinner. But I can
hold my liquor.

JUAN ANTONIO
She never mentioned her ulcer.

VICKY
No. No, because...she’s a mental
adolescent, and being romantic, she
has a, a death wish.
33.

VICKY(cont'd)
So for a, a brief moment of
passion, she, she completely
abandons all responsibilities.

EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY
A boat moves across the water near the lighthouse.
Vicky and Cristina walk down a walkway together.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
After lunch, Juan Antonio took
Vicky to see the old lighthouse at
Avilés, which she found very
beautiful.

EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - LATER
Juan Antonio and Vicky sit on a wall overlooking the sea.

JUAN ANTONIO
Um, I was born near here and, ah
it would be a sin if I came out
here without paying a visit to my
father. Would that be boring to
you?

VICKY
Boring? Uh, no. No. I think that
would be the first genuinely
interesting proposition you’ve made
me. I would, uh, I would love to
see your father and his house.

EXT. FATHER’S HOUSE - DAY

Juan Antonio’s car pulls up in front of the house. Vicky and
Juan Antonio get out of the car. Juan Antonio’s FATHER comes
out to greet them.

FATHER
Hola, hijo.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hola, ¢gcdémo estas?

FATHER
Muy bien.

JUAN ANTONIO
Te veo muy bien. Tan guapo.
34.

Juan Antonio’s father laughs.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Mira. Eh, mi amiga. Vicky.

Vicky holds out her hand and the father shakes it.

VICKY
Buenos dias.

FATHER
Buenos dias.

JUAN ANTONIO
(to Vicky)
My father, Julio.

Vicky and the father kiss on the cheeks.

VICKY
Julio.

Vicky gestures at the house.

VICKY (cont’d)
Buenos dias. Qué casa tan bonita.

JUAN ANTONIO
Well.

FATHER
Considera que es tuya.

VICKY
(chuckles)
Oh, you know, if we carry on, I
don’t think it’s gonna--

JUAN ANTONIO
That’s fine, that was great. Uh, he
speaks no English.
(to his father)
Entiende un poquito de espafiol
ella.

FATHER
Ah, porque no me importa. Pasad,
pasad. Adelante.

The father walks toward the house. Vicky and Juan Antonio
follow him.
35.

VICKY
I’m sure my Spanish is gonna go.

INT. FATHER’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

The father walks into the house and Vicky and Juan Antonio
follow him.

JUAN ANTONIO
He refuses to speak any other
language, and that’s an important
point with my father, actually.

VICKY
Oh, really? It is? Why?

JUAN ANTONIO
Because he’s a poet and he writes
the most beautiful sentences in the
Spanish language, but he -- I don’t
know -- he doesn’t believe that a
poet should pollute his words by
any other tongue which is quite a--

VICKY
Right, right. No, it makes sense. I
understand, ‘cause of the
translation and the things you
might lose. I mean I, I took some
Spanish. Of course, I have no flair
for languages. I read it much
better than I speak it.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

VICKY
Maybe I could read your father.

JUAN ANTONIO
No, but he doesn’t publish. That’s
the point.

The father picks up two liquor glasses.

FATHER
¢éCofiac?

VICKY
(to Juan Antonio)
Oh, no?
36.

JUAN ANTONIO
Nope.

The father hands the glasses to Juan Antonio and leaves the
room.

VICKY
Well, why not?

JUAN ANTONIO
Be-, eh, I’1l explain later. Do you
want some cofiac?
VICKY
Uh, eh, yes, thank you, just a
very, very, very little.
The father returns with a bottle of cognac.

JUAN ANTONIO
Si. Un poquito.

The father laughs and pours cognac into the glasses.

VICKY
But-- Thank you.

JUAN ANTONIO SUBTITLES
(in Spanish to his father) You look good - you look
Te veo bien. Tienes cara de healthy, Papa.

Juan Antonio takes one of the glasses of cognac and hands the
other glass to Vicky.

Vicky looks around at the books

FATHER

The father laughs. Juan Antonio

JUAN ANTONIO

And I wanted to play music, too. I

it.

VICKY
Oh, Cristina says the same thing.

JUAN ANTONIO
Cristina’s a very interesting girl.

Juan Antonio gestures at a low wall around a tree.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Wanna sit?

VICKY
Yeah.

Juan Antonio and Vicky sit down on the wall.

VICKY (cont’d)
So, uh, tell me, why won’t your
father publish his poems?

JUAN ANTONIO
Well, because he hates the world,
and that’s his way of getting back
at them -- to create beautiful
works and then...to deny them to
the public, which I think, it’s...

VICKY
My God. Well, what makes him
so...angry toward the human race?

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm, because after thousands of
years of civilization...they still
haven’t learned to love.

INT. OVIEDO HOTEL/VICKY & CRISTINA’S ROOM - DAY
Vicky hands a bowl of soup to Cristina, who lies in bed.

NARRATOR (V.0.)

very nice.

on Earth. My father used to bring
me here.

All right, then.

Juan Antonio picks up a bottle of wine and pours more wine
into Vicky’s glass.

VICKY
Oh, thank you. What is this wine?
It’s delicious.

JUAN ANTONIO
It’s great. Was that your fiance?

Vicky nods hesitantly at him.

VICKY
Uh, yes. Yes.

JUAN ANTONIO
Why were you so nervous speaking to
him?

VICKY
W-was I nervous?

JUAN ANTONIO
(chuckling)
Yes, you turned red.

VICKY
Eh, well, I-- Well, I’m sure it’s,
I’m sure it’s the wine.

JUAN ANTONIO
Would he be upset if he knew we
were dining together?

VICKY
No, not at all! Are you kidding? I
mean, I, I don’t think he’d love
the basic concept of me sitting
with a man drinking wine over
candlelight, but he’d, he’d quickly
realize there’d be nothing to worry
about, so, uh...

Vicky picks up her glass of wine.
42.

VICKY (cont'd)
Would you ever withhold your work
from the public out of rage?

JUAN ANTONIO
No-no-no. I’m not like my father.
Oh, no I told you, I...affirm life
despite everything.

VICKY
Right, right. Well...I’d be, uh,
I’d be curious to see your work.

JUAN ANTONIO
Really? Why? You are so-- I mean
you are so disapproving of me.

VICKY
Well, I’ve gotten to know you
better and...you know, it’d be
interesting and after all, you are
a Catalan painter, and that’s my
subject.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm. What gave you such an
interest in Catalan culture?

VICKY
Well, uh...I, uh, fell in love with
Gaudi’s church when I was fourteen
and...one thing led to another.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hm. And-and, uh...you also admire
Spanish guitar, I hear

VICKY
Yes, yes.

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

VICKY
I love the guitar.

JUAN ANTONIO
Would you like to go to hear some
wonderful guitar tonight?

Vicky drinks from her glass and looks at him nervously.
43.

VICKY
Tonight?

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm-hm.

VICKY
Well, it’s, it’s a little late and,
you know, I’m, I’m a little wobbly
from the wine.

JUAN ANTONIO
No-no-no-no-no. You said you could
hold your alcohol. Besides, we
leave tomorrow.

Vicky nods her head.

VICKY
Okay, sure.

JUAN ANTONIO
Great.

Juan Antonio toasts with Vicky.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

A GUITAR PLAYER sits on a chair and PLAYS the guitar. Some
PEOPLE sit on benches and the ground to listen to him. Juan
Antonio and Vicky sit amidst the group. Vicky listens
intently to the music. Vicky turns and looks emotionally at
Juan Antonio. She then looks back at the guitar player.

EXT. PARK - LATER

Juan Antonio and Vicky walk across the park after the
performance. They are alone as they cross the grass.

VICKY
That was, uh, that was
unbelievable. Thank you, thank you.

JUAN ANTONIO
I was looking at your face and you
looked very moved.
Vicky nods her head.

VICKY
Yes, yes.
44.

JUAN ANTONIO
A few times, I saw a look like

that.

VICKY
Right. On, on Maria Elena, I’m
sure.

JUAN ANTONIO
Oh, well, yes, maybe on Maria
Elena. I mean, if she saw or heard
something that moved her, yes.

VICKY
You’re still in love with her.

JUAN ANTONIO
No, I’m not, I’m not.

Vicky and Juan Antonio stop and turn toward one another.

VICKY
Mm, that confirms it.

Juan Antonio shakes his head.

JUAN ANTONIO
No, she will always be a part of me
and...she’s an important person in
my life, but for the two of us
something was...not working.

VICKY
Well...what element?

JUAN ANTONIO
We never found out.

Vicky nods her head.

VICKY
Mm.

Vicky looks away from Juan Antonio, then looks emotionally at
him.
VICKY (cont’d)
You, um...you said you were looking
at my face.

Juan Antonio smiles at her.
45.

VICKY (cont’d)
Why?

JUAN ANTONIO
Why were you looking at mine?

VICKY
Was I?

JUAN ANTONIO
You probably saw my tears.

Vicky nods her head.

VICKY
Yes. You...yeah, um, mm, I’ma
little out of control.

JUAN ANTONIO
I was looking at your
face...because I find it very
beautiful.

VICKY
You do?

JUAN ANTONIO
Of course I do. Of course I do, and
you know I do.

Juan Antonio leans toward Vicky and kisses her. They kiss
passionately. They slide down out of frame.

Vicky sits in the backseat looking down as Juan Antonio flies
the plane and Cristina sits in the passenger seat beside him.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
On the trip home, Vicky, who had
mentioned nothing to Cristina, was
silent. Cristina, on the other
hand, talked nervously.

CRISTINA
I must apologize to both of you
for, for ruining the whole weekend!
I’m completely mortified!
I’m...humiliated. I, I don’t know
whether it was the wine.
46.

CRISTINA(cont'd)
It could have been the shellfish
because of, you know, I have this
ulcer, and I, I just thank God you
knew enough sights to keep Vicky
occupied. You know, I had these
horrible nightmares that you two
would be like oil and water, hating
every minute of being together. I-I
just couldn’t move.

INT. LIBARARY - DAY

CRISTINA
Juan Antonio. He called me just
now.

VICKY

Juan Antonio called you?

CRISTINA
Yeah, he wants to see me and take
me to some vineyard, some wine
tasting or something. I said,
“Absolutely.”

VICKY
A wine tasting. But what about your
ulcer?

CRISTINA

Oh, no, no, it’s fine. A little
wine’s not gonna hurt me. I mean
the point is that he wants to see
me. Isn’t that great?

VICKY
Yeah. Yeah.

CRISTINA
I can’t believe it. I never thought
he was gonna call.

VICKY
Mm, that’s great. I’m happy for
you.

How are you?

VICKY
My goodness, what are you doing
here?

Vicky and Juan Antonio kiss on the cheeks.
Vicky gestures at Juan Antonio’s sketchbook

JUAN ANTONIO
Uh, nothing, just doing some, some
sketches.

Vicky nods nervously at him.

VICKY
Oh, right. Well, I, uh, I didn't
mean to disturb you, so....

JUAN ANTONIO
Disturb me, no. How could you
disturb me? I...we never had a
chance to say a proper good-bye.

VICKY
Oh. Well, y-you could have called
me.
55.

JUAN ANTONIO
I...yeah, I, I debated it. But I
didn't think there was much point

VICKY
Yeah, but y-you, you never phoned.
Not to say anything. I mean
"Thank you, it was fun."

Vicky rubs her forehead nervously.

VICKY (cont’d)
I mean, y-you don't make love to
someone and then never call
them...unless you were greatly
disappointed.

JUAN ANTONIO
Quite the opposite. But...you have
plans to marry and I thought it
best to stop anything before it led
to a bad situation for everyone.

VICKY
Yeah, well, I'm only saying that we
made love, and, and you seemed to
drop off the face of the earth. I
mean, I realize these things don't
mean much to you.

JUAN ANTONIO
I mean, to pursue matters would
have only caused you anxiety, and
for me, a disappointment.

Vicky shakes her head at him.

VICKY
I had the ability to hurt you after
one night?

JUAN ANTONIO
Maria Elena used to say that...only
unfulfilled love can be romantic.

VICKY
Right. Okay. Well, the truth is,
you're, you're much more suited to
Cristina.
56.

JUAN ANTONIO
I've grown very fond of Cristina.
So, I'm very happy for you and your
husband-to-be.
Vicky nods haltingly at Juan Antonio.

VICKY
And I...for you and Cristina.

accepted.

57.

DOUG
Beautiful! Oh, my God.

Doug turns and looks at the CABBIE.

DOUG (cont’d)
How much do I owe you?

here.
VICKY

DOUG
You were so into it.
VICKY
Well, am I not usually?
DOUG

Yeah, y-- I'm giving you a

compliment. Maybe it’s the
Barcelona air.

VICKY
Come here, hold me. Hold me.

DOUG
You okay?

VICKY
Yeah. Yeah.

DOUG

How's Cristina doin'?

VICKY
Oh, you know, she's, she's already
moved in with some guy.

DOUG
That was quick. Don't tell me he's
a bullfighter.

VICKY
(chuckles)
No.

DOUG
Writer? Composer? Tortured pseudo-
intellectual and self-destructive?

VICKY
Mm, yeah, I know. Sometimes she
gets on my nerves with her crackpot
love affairs.

Doug shakes his head.

DOUG
Yeah, look, I love her
because...she's your friend, but
I've often warned you about her.
She's an unhappy person.

Doug picks up a glass of water off the night stand and drinks
from it. Vicky looks thoughtfully at him.

DOUG (cont’d)
She can't part with that self-image
she has of the oh-so-special woman,
the artist trying to find herself.
I find her contempt for normal
values pretentious. It's a boring
cliché.
61.

VICKY
Yeah, well, men like her.

DOUG
Well, she's pretty. And not
exactly difficult to maneuver into
the sack.

Doug runs his hand along her arm.

DOUG (cont’d)
Now you, on the other hand...took a
little effort to get to bed.

Vicky chuckles softly.

DOUG (cont’d)
Hey.

Doug gently lifts her chin to make her look at him.

DOUG (cont’d)
But it was worth the struggle.

Vicky smiles and nods at him.

VICKY
Yeah?

DOUG
Yeah.

Doug and Vicky kiss.

VICKY
I don't think I like the way you
say that.

JUAN ANTONIO
No, I, I, I only mean that you make
a comfortable couple, in the best
sense, Vicky.

VICKY
Look, you don't understand. I can't
do anything about it now. I'mn-,

I didn’t.

VICKY
Yes, when I looked over at you.

I, I mean, my intention was to
touch Cristina.

Vicky shakes her head.

VICKY
Oh. Okay, I, I, I'm, I'm sorry. I
apologize for my mistake.

Vicky folds her arms and shakes her head.

I'm sorry, it was my mistake, but
listen, look.

Listen, listen, you are all set to
enter, to enter a completely
different life.

MARIA ELENA SUBTITLE

Maria Elena shakes her head at Juan Antonio.

MARIA ELENA
Why are you, why are you getting so
angry at me?!

JUAN ANTONIO
Why in the world--

MARIA ELENA
Why are you getting so angry at

JUAN ANTONIO
Why--? Listen. Listen. Why were

Juan Antonio reenters, sits down on the bed and looks at

JUAN ANTONIO
Well, eh, not when you tried to

Maria Elena waves her hand dismissively at him.

MARIA ELENA
Oh, that.
82.

JUAN ANTONIO
Y-Yeah, that. That small detail.

Yes.

Juan Antonio rubs his face with exasperation.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
I mean, I mean, eh, you...you are
suspicious of her because she is
now my lover. I mean, it's so

obvious.

Maria Elena reaches out and tousles his hair, but Juan

Antonio pulls away from her.

Juan Antonio, Cristina and Maria Elena sit around a table in
the backyard and eat breakfast. Maria Elena smokes a
cigarette and stares at Cristina. Cristina looks at Maria

Elena and smiles politely.

JUAN ANTONIO

(to Cristina)
More coffee?

CRISTINA

Yes, please.

Juan Antonio picks up the coffee pot and starts to pour
coffee into Cristina’s cup. Some of the coffee splashes out

of the cup.

JUAN ANTONIO

I’m sorry.

CRISTINA

It’s okay.

Maria Elena sneers.

JUAN ANTONIO
Here’s sugar.

CRISTINA
Oh no, thank you, thank you.

Maria Elena walks toward the house. Juan Antonio takes a
cigarette out of a pack.

JUAN ANTONIO
Would you like to paint?

CRISTINA
(to Maria Elena)
Oh, do you paint, also?

Maria Elena gestures at Juan Antonio with disbelief.

MARIA ELENA SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) Do I paint, she asks.
Que si pinto, dice.

Maria Elena wags her finger at Juan Antonio.

MARIA ELENA
Ask him, ask him. Ah, he stole
everything from me. His whole
style.

Juan Antonio rubs the back of his head and looks at Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO
She likes to make up these stories.

Maria Elena puts a cigarette in her mouth.

MARIA ELENA
Juan Antonio, your whole way of
seeing is mine.

JUAN ANTONIO
I'm not saying that you were not
influential.

MARIA ELENA
Influential?

JUAN ANTONIO
Yes.

Uh, she always had problems with
reality and I'm not going to get
angry. I'm not going to get angry.

MARIA ELENA
Okay, what did they say in art
school? They said I was a genius,
right?

JUAN ANTONIO
I'm always, I always encouraged
your talent.

MARIA ELENA
Not talent, I'm not talking about
talent. I said genius. Genius.

JUAN ANTONIO
I came close to killing for you.
87.

MARIA ELENA
Yeah, you came close to killing me.
With a chair.

Cristina turns and looks at Juan Antonio.

JUAN ANTONIO
I was defending myself, and you had

Where were you? Were you writing?

CRISTINA
Yeah.

JUAN ANTONIO
Yes?

CRISTINA
I was trying to.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hey.

Cristina leans toward Juan Antonio.

CRISTINA
I'm so curious. Does she really
think that you stole from her?

JUAN ANTONIO
Ummm. Well, um, I-I guess I
took...more from her than I like to
admit, yes. That's why I'm always
so...sensitive when she brings it
up.

CRISTINA
(whispering)
Yeah

Cristina turns and walks down the hall. Juan Antonio follows
her.
89.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
I feel kinda sad.

JUAN ANTONIO
Why?

CRISTINA
‘Cause I feel like I'm never gonna
be able to, um...

Cristina and Juan Antonio stop and Cristina turns toward him.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
...to influence you or inspire you
in any way.

JUAN ANTONIO
Oh, no, that's not true.

That's how I feel.

Ow.

CRISTINA
Wait, no, sit down. Sit-sit-sit-

Juan Antonio looks at Cristina.
JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
(to Cristina)
Do you know, she, she plays piano?
Cristina sits down.
CRISTINA

No, I, I...I didn't know. Is that
why you have a piano in the house?
97.

MARIA ELENA
Well, I could have been a concert
pianist.

JUAN ANTONIO
Yes, you could have. I mean, no
one plays Scarlatti like Maria
Elena. And...she understands
Scarlatti. Am I right?

MARIA ELENA
Do you play music?

Cristina looks hesitantly at Maria Elena and shakes her head.

CRISTINA
No, I just have to come face to
face with the fact that I am not
gifted, you know? I-I can
appreciate art and I love music,
but...it's sad, really, because I
feel like I have a lot to express
and I am not gifted.

MARIA ELENA
But you do have talent.

CRISTINA
No.

MARIA ELENA
Yes.

CRISTINA
I-- what's my talent?

MARIA ELENA
You take beautiful photographs.

JUAN ANTONIO
That's true. She always takes
pictures that she hides from me.

Cristina looks nervously at Juan Antonio and Maria Elena.
CRISTINA
That’s-- No, that's, that's because
they're nothing. How do you know I
take pictures?

Maria Elena stops massaging Juan Antonio’s neck.
98.

MARIA ELENA
I found them in your luggage.

Cristina looks at Maria Elena with disbelief.

CRISTINA
You went through my luggage?

MARIA ELENA
Of course I went through your
luggage. First night I was in the
house, I didn't trust you. I didn't
believe you were who you said you
were. I wanted to know who was
really sharing the bed of my ex-
husband.

CRISTINA
What?!

MARIA ELENA
Who knew what I would find there?
How could I be sure you were not
going to hurt me? After all, I had
thoughts of killing you.

It’s amazing. You're never out of

We just did our place in Greenwich.
You have to see it.

Vicky turns to Sally.

SALLY (cont’d)
We have, we have this wonderful
decorator you should use. He's, um,
he's creative, but he knows when to
back off. We did it, uh
modern...with just a splash of
antiques here and there. I love
combining the two, but God, the
prices. Do you have any idea what a
good size oriental rug costs?

DOUG
She's right. She's right. A-
Actually, there's an old joke. "A

that...that I'm looking for some
kind of magical solution, which,
which is unrealistic and that I...I-

saw us.

VICKY
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. Look, I--

JUDY
I was just....

VICKY
Look, you, eh, you mustn't feel
that you have to explain yourself
to me. I--
105.

JUDY
I mean...Mark is great.
(weeps softly)
I'm sure any...any dissatisfaction
I have is my own problem.

VICKY
No.

JUDY
I'm just, uh...I, I, I can't leave
him and I know that I never will.

VICKY
Well...why not?

JUDY
I'm just, I can't. I'm...too
scared. And the mo-- the moment's
passed.

EXT. FATHER’S HOUSE - DAY

Juan Antonio’s father walks to Juan Antonio’s car as his son
Cristina and Maria Elena get out of the car.

Maria Elena runs around the car and embraces Juan Antonio’s
father joyfully. The father lets go of Maria Elena and steps
toward Juan Antonio. They kiss on the cheeks.

EXT. FATHER’S HOUSE - LATER
Cristina and Maria Elena walk across the yard.

CRISTINA
It's so apparent to me that you and
Juan Antonio are still in love when
I see you together.

MARIA ELENA
Mm. Our love...

CRISTINA
You know?

MARIA ELENA
Our love will last forever. It's
forever, but it just doesn't work
That's why it will always be
romantic. Because it cannot be
complete.
106.

CRISTINA
Well, maybe it can't be complete
because, you know, I'm getting in
the way or, I don't know. I feel
like...

Maria Elena shakes her head.

MARIA ELENA
No. Before you...

CRISTINA
.. if I--

MARIA ELENA
...before you, we used to cause
each other so much pain, so much
suffering. Without you, all this
would not be possible. You know
why? Because you are the missing
ingredient. You are like the tint
that, added to a palette, makes the
color beautiful.

Cristina and Maria Elena stop and sit down on a bench. Maria
Elena lights a cigarette.

CRISTINA
You know, aren't you and Juan
Antonio tempted to make love? I
feel like, I don't know.

MARIA ELENA
No-no. A-At the end of our
marriage, we didn't. But I have to
say, those feelings are coming back
now...thanks to you...in a new and
deeper way.

CRISTINA
Well, I wouldn't be upset about it.
You know, I'd never want to get in
the way. It wouldn't, it wouldn't
upset me at all.

MARIA ELENA
I know you wouldn't be upset. The
same way I get this warm feeling
when I hear you both locked in
passion every night. I listen and
I'm happy.
107.

EXT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE - DAY

Cristina, holding a glass of wine, wanders between the trees
in the backyard.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Was Cristina okay with it when
Maria Elena and Juan Antonio made
love one afternoon? Beforehand,
she gave them both her blessing,
but then had mixed feelings. She
was not quite as open-minded as she
had always imagined herself, and
the thought of the two of them in
bed, and inevitably full of
intensity, caused her some
conflict.

Cristina sits down on a chair.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
In the end, she gradually relaxed
and let herself go with the flow of
things, a tolerance she was proud
of.

EXT. BARCELONA STREETS - DAY
Cristina, Vicky and Doug walk down a street.

CRISTINA
At first, it did bother me, but
then I started to think about all
these standard, accepted clichés of
love, you know, what's right
what's wrong, what's appropriate,
according to the "appropriate
police."

VICKY
Mm-hm.

CRISTINA
And, you know, you see how screwed
up most relationships are, you know
what I mean?

DOUG
So what you're saying is you're
sharing a man. You're like a Mormon
wife.
108.

CRISTINA
I, I know it sounds strange, but
actually, we all contribute to the
relationship and we're all really
nourished by it.

DOUG
But if everyone did that, society
couldn't function that way.

CRISTINA
Oh, come on!

Vicky shakes her head.

VICKY
No, Doug, come on, let's not get
into one of those turgid,
categorical imperative arguments.

CRISTINA
You know, Maria Elena believes that
there are many truths in life, not
just one.

VICKY
Whatever works.

Doug looks at Vicky with disbelief.

DOUG
Whatever works?

VICKY
Yeah.

DOUG

I don't know. I mean, babe...
Doug clasps Vicky by the arm.

DOUG (cont'd)
...could you live like that?

VICKY
Well, it, I-I never had
Cristina's....

DOUG
What? Cristina's lack of
structure?
109.

CRISTINA
It's very structured, actually.
VICKY
Her courage, I never had her
courage.
DOUG

Her courage? Courage?
Doug, Cristina and Vicky walk to a table at a sidewalk cafe.

DOUG (cont’d)
Next thing, she'll be going to bed
with Maria Elena and glorifying it
as some kind of superior
alternative lifestyle.

Doug sits across from Cristina and Vicky. Cristina looks at
Doug.

CRISTINA
Oh, I have gone to bed with her

Doug and Vicky look at Cristina with surprise.

VICKY
No!

CRISTINA
Yeah.

VICKY
When?

CRISTINA

Well, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
have made this darkroom for me, you
know. They're both pushing me to
take photographs and, uh, actually,
I'm getting pretty good. Believe
it or not, I'm getting much more
confident.

INT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE/DARKROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK
Cristina puts a photograph of Maria Elena in a bath of

developing fluid. Photographs hang on the wall around the
room.
110.

CRISTINA (V.0.)
And, and we were down there in the
darkroom, and, um...I was just
working on some of my photographs,
things that...you know, I wouldn't
have done if she hadn't inspired
me.

Cristina steps to some of the developing baths as Maria Elena
picks up a photograph and looks at it. Maria looks around at
the photographs on the lines.

Maria Elena takes some photographs out of the developer and
looks at them.

Maria Elena stops and looks at a photograph in the developing
solution. Cristina holds up several photographs of Maria
Elena and looks at them. She takes one of the photographs of
Maria Elena posed against the graffiti and holds up the
photograph against another, which is hanging on the line.

Maria Elena walks up beside Cristina. Maria Elena runs her
hand down Cristina’s arm, then Cristina runs her hand up onto
Maria Elena’s shoulder. Cristina lowers the photograph, then
turns to Maria Elena. Maria Elena caresses Cristina’s face.

Then they kiss. They lean back and caress one another, then
kiss passionately.
EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
Cristina smiles at Vicky.
CRISTINA
And it happened very naturally for
both of us.

Vicky and Doug stare at Cristina.

VICKY
You weren’t nervous?

CRISTINA
No, no, it was very loving and
gentle.

VICKY
Did you enjoy it?

Cristina nods her head.
111.

CRISTINA
Mm-hm. I did.

A WAITRESS enters and puts down glasses and silverware on the
table.

VICKY
And...eh, is, it was just the one
time?

CRISTINA
Yeah, yeah.

The waitress leaves.

CRISTINA (cont'd)
I mean, it just happened, you know?
I'm not planning on making a habit
out of it, necessarily.

Doug gestures hesitantly at Cristina.

DOUG
But if you...enjoyed it, come
on....
CRISTINA
I did, I did...at the time.
VICKY
Well, did you tell Juan Antonio?
CRISTINA
Yeah, of course. There's nothing
to hide.
DOUG
Would you say, then, you are a
bisexual?
CRISTINA

No...I see no reason to label
everything. I'm me! You know? And
I've slept with Juan Antonio since
and enjoyed that experience very
much.

Vicky shakes her head.

VICKY
Wow. It's a great story.

Vicky chuckles softly.
112.

Doug nervously moves around the silverware on the table.

DOUG
Yep. That's a...great story.

Doug opens his napkin and puts it down on his lap.

DOUG (cont’d)
Hey, look, I d-- I don't set myself
up as a judge, so....

INT. NASH HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Doug sits on the bed and types on his laptop computer. He
glances at Vicky as she brushes her hair thoughtfully in the
bathroom.

DOUG
What are you thinking?

VICKY
Hm? Oh, I don't know. How quickly
time passes.

Vicky walks to the bed.
VICKY (cont’d)
Summer's almost over. We're going
home soon.
Vicky sits down on the edge of the bed.
DOUG
I thought you were still, uh
dwelling about your friend's little
tale of lust in the darkroom.

Vicky stops brushing her hair and looks down. Doug puts down
his laptop and crawls across the bed to her.

DOUG (cont’d)
And speaking of darkrooms....

Doug kneels behind Vicky and kisses her shoulder.

DOUG (cont’d)
Come here.

Doug leans toward Vicky and kisses her around her face. Doug
gently pulls Vicky down on the bed as they continue to kiss.
113.

EXT. BARCELONA STREETS - DAY

Cristina walks down the sidewalk in a crowd of PEDESTRIANS.
Cristina stops and takes a photograph of some flowers ina
flower stall. She continues walking and then stops to take
another photograph.

INT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE/DARKROOM - DAY

Cristina develops photographs as Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
watch.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Over the next weeks, Cristina
became more and more sure of
herself as a photographer. Both
Juan Antonio and Maria Elena
contributed ideas and support when
she had doubts. Thanks to their
encouragement, photography was
becoming a productive interest in
her life.

Maria Elena rubs Cristina’s shoulder. Cristina smiles, then
kisses Juan Antonio.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
By now, she and Juan Antonio and
Maria Elena had become lovers.

Maria Elena and Cristina caress one another’s cheeks, then
kiss.

EXT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE - DAY

Maria Elena sits beside the pool and gently rocks her foot in
the water. Juan Antonio paints on a canvas. Cristina sits in
a chair and holds a book in her hands.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Everything seemed perfectly
balanced, perfectly in tune. Maria
Elena was calm and relaxed. Juan
Antonio was going through a very
creative period with his painting.

Cristina looks up thoughtfully.
114.

NARRATOR (V.0.) (cont'd)
It was only Cristina, as the last
days of summer expired, who began
to experience an old, familiar
stirring...a growing restlessness
that she dreaded, but recognized
only too well.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Cristina sits on some stone steps beside the sea and stares
thoughtfully out at the water.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Suddenly, thoughts started taking
precedence over feelings. Thoughts
and questions about life and love.
And, as much as she tried to resist
these ideas, she could not get them
from her mind.

INT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

Maria Elena, in the middle of drying dishes, looks at
Cristina with shock. Juan Antonio turns and looks at
Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO
You're moving out?

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Finally summoning her resolve, one
evening after dinner, she made an
announcement that surprised
everyone.

CRISTINA
I mean, I, I, I, I don't want what
Vicky has. I don't want what my
parents had. I don't want what I
had before I came here. I mean, I
know that. But I, I, I know I can't
live like this forever.

MARIA ELENA SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) Did I tell you or not?
ete lo dije o no te lo dije?
115.

JUAN ANTONIO SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) Okay.
Vale, vale.

Maria Elena leans against the counter and rubs her face
agitatedly.

JUAN ANTONIO
What do you want, Cristina?

CRISTINA
I want something different

JUAN ANTONIO
What?

CRISTINA
I'm, I-I-I don't know. Not this.

JUAN ANTONIO
There is no answer, Cristina.
There is no, there is no single
answer.

Maria Elena turns toward Juan Antonio and gestures angrily at
him.

MARIA ELENA SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) Don't you understand, she's
Juan Antonio, que no lo gotten what she wanted. She
entiendes. Que ya ha wants something else. This
conseguido lo que queria. isn't enough for her.

Quiere otra cosa. Que esto ya
no le basta. Es como una
enfermedad, que nunca le va a
bastar con nada.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Maria Elena, Maria Elena.

CRISTINA
Please...don't get so upset.
Please. And can you speak English?
I can't understand you.

JUAN ANTONIO
A ver, habla inglés, por favor.

Nunca se va a conformar con

SUBTITLES
This girl will never be
satisfied with anything.

SUBTITLES
Speak English so she can
understand us.

SUBTITLES
I knew you would use us. I
knew you would use us. And
you used us. I knew it.

Maria Elena slams her hand down on the counter.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont‘d)

Ya, vale, vale...

SUBTITLES

I knew it! TI knew it.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Ya. Maria Elena. Por fav-- Speak
English, please so she can
understand it, all right? Ya.

Maria Elena sobs. Maria Elena wags her finger at Crisina.

MARIA ELENA
(to Cristina)
Chronic dissatisfaction. That's
what you have. Chronic
dissatisfaction.

JUAN ANTONIO
Ya, ya.

MARIA ELENA
Big sickness. Big sickness.
117.

JUAN ANTONIO SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) That's not it, Maria Elena.
Eh, no es eso, Maria Elena, That's not it. It's simply
no es eso. Es simplemente... that... Look at me.

Es simplemente...Mirame.

Juan Antonio clasps Maria Elena by the chin.

JUAN ANTONIO
It's simply that...

Maria Elena looks at Cristina.

MARIA ELENA
(to Cristina)
How can you...? Do you know how
much we love you?

CRISTINA
Yeah. And I love you both.

MARIA ELENA
No, you don't!

CRISTINA
Yes, I do.

MARIA ELENA
No, you don't!

CRISTINA
It has nothing to do with that!

kisses her to calm her down.

118.

then

JUAN ANTONIO (cont‘d)

(in Spanish)

Oye, callate. Callate ya, por

favor.

SUBTITLES
Shut up now please.

Juan Antonio turns Maria Elena away from Cristina. Maria
Elena slaps her hand down angrily on the stove.

JUAN ANTONIO
(in Spanish)

Callate ya. Es evidente que
no ha encontrado a la persona
adecuada. El dia que
encuentre a la persona
adecuada, que no somos ni tu,
ni somos yo...pues toda esta
cosa suya, de encontrar la
tranquilidad y la fa...la

pasara.

Maria Elena shakes her head and
She taps her finger against the

MARIA ELENA

Que no es eso. Te lo metes en

JUAN ANTONIO
(in Spanish)

Juan Antonio looks at Cristina.

SUBTITLES
Shut up now. It's simply that
she hasn't met the right
person yet. When she does
find the right person - not
you or me - this whole thing
about finding peace and
happiness will pass.

SUBTITLES

That's not it.

SUBTITLES
Okay, fine.

JUAN ANTONIO
Where will you go, Cristina?

MARIA ELENA

Que no.
119.

CRISTINA
I, um, I just got to get out of
here for a few weeks and I'm, just
got to clear my head. It's not--
This is all my...problem. It has
nothing to do with you.

Juan Antonio steps toward Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO
Come, come here. Ay.

Cristina steps toward Juan Antonio. Juan Antonio embraces
Cristina and kisses her head. Juan Antonio holds his arm
around Cristina.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
Let's be...thankful for all the
good times that we've spent
together.

Maria Elena turns her head away from them.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
All right?

Juan Antonio puts his hand on Maria Elena’s back. Maria Elena
turns toward them and tries to control her emotions.

JUAN ANTONIO (cont'd)
And, and remember each other with
respect. All right? And love and
affection. All right?

Maria Elena steps toward Cristina and embraces her.

EXT. BEACH - DAY
Cristina and Vicky sit together on the stone steps.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Cristina told all that had happened
to Vicky and said she was going to
France for a few weeks to think
things out. She would return to
pick her up, so they could go back
to New York together.

VICKY
That's good for the relationship.
120.

CRISTINA
Yeah.
EXT. MUSEUM NACIONAL DE ART - DAY

Vicky and Judy walk down the steps of the museum. Banners on
the museum read: “MUSEU D’ART: EL CARTEL MODERN.”

JUDY
So it's been Juan Antonio all this
time?

VICKY

Uh, look, I'm, I'm not gonna do
anything. For-forget I said-- I j-,
I just needed to tell someone and,
and we've become close, so....

JUDY
Well, why, why don't you act on it?

VICKY
What, act now?

JUDY
Yes.

Judy and Vicky walk to a railing where they can see a view of
the city.

VICKY
What, break up with Doug, who's
really a sweet guy and married me
in good faith, for the...for what?
For a bohemian Spanish painter with
a passionate tie to an ex-
wife...who probably doesn't even
share my feelings, if he ever did?

JUDY
Y-Yeah.

VICKY
So-- Oh, God, who am I kidding? I,
but the, the dream is exciting.

JUDY
If, if I were you, I wouldn't waste
another minute. I'd, I'd get on
it. I'd--
121.

VICKY
Well, get on what?

JUDY
Well, you're in love with him. If--
Do something or the, the years will
pass by and you will be sorry,
Vicky.

Vicky shakes her head.

VICKY
No, no. What are you saying? I,
look, I can't risk everything. If,
if Juan Antonio had never existed,
I'd be fine with Doug.

JUDY
Just, you'd-- Just fine?

VICKY
Yeah, as I planned.

JUDY
Just fine?
(scoffs)
How, how blunt do you want me to
be? I, when I look at Doug, I...see
Mark. I....

VICKY
Yeah, well, you're using me to
rewrite your own history.

EXT. NASH HOUSE - DAY

Through windows Judy can be seen walking through the living
room and talking on a cordless phone.

JUDY
(into telephone)
If, if there's some way...

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Despite Vicky's protestations, Judy
was possessed with finding a way to
bring her and Juan Antonio
together...and prevailed upon her
friend, Gabriella, who was a figure
in the art world, to throw a party,
and invite Vicky and Juan Antonio.
JUDY

(into telephone)

122.

Yeah, I have his number.

EXT. BAR - DAY

Juan Antonio walks angrily out of the bar and down a street
Maria Elena hurries out of the bar and after him.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
Meanwhile, as predicted, without
Cristina, the relationship between
Juan Antonio and Maria Elena had

gone back to its old

destructiveness.

Maria Elena shoves Juan Antonio angrily. PEOPLE on the street
turn and stare at them. Juan Antonio walk down the street.
Juan Antonio gestures angrily at Maria Elena.

JUAN ANTONIO
(in Spanish)
...dedicado de mi tiempo a
tus fobias, a tus locuras, a
tus mierdas. Eso afecta a mi
trabajo, gentiendes?

MARIA ELENA
(in Spanish)
iQue yo no tengo la culpa de
que tu trabajo se haya ido a
la mierda y yo no tengo la

culpa de que no te enteras de

nada y no creces y no
maduras!

SUBTITLES
I devote all my time to you -
pampering you, nursing your
tics and phobias. My work
suffers.

SUBTITLES
It's not my fault. It's not
my fault that your work has
gone to shit and that you
don't mature.

JUAN ANTONIO
No puedo seguir viviendo asi, Maria

Elena.

MARIA ELENA
(in Spanish)
cSabes lo triste que es para
mi ver que nunca en tu puta
vida te vas a dar cuenta del
potencial que tienes?

SUBTITLES
Do you know what it is like
for me to see that you will
never realize your full
potential?
123.

JUAN ANTONIO SUBTITLES
(in Spanish) Leave me alone. Leave me
Déjame en paz. Maria Elena, alone, please!

déjame en paz, déjame en paz.
Déjame en paz.

Maria Elena stops, then turns back and slaps Juan Antonio
repeatedly.
NARRATOR (V.0.)
As had happened before...
EXT. JUAN ANTONIO’S HOUSE - DAY

Maria Elena carries her bags, opens the gate and walks to a
taxi.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
...by mutual consent, Maria Elena
packed her things and moved out of
Juan Antonio's house.

Maria Elena gets into the taxi and the taxi moves down the
street.
EXT. GABRIELLA’S HOUSE - DAY

PARTY GUESTS stand around a pool outside the house. Judy
talks to Mark and Doug as Vicky looks away distractedly.

JUDY
...He's, he's a real sweet guy.
DOUG
Yeah.
MARK
I, I think he's sweet.
DOUG
Yeah.
MARK.

I mean, he just, he owns his....
He gets in very close.

JUDY
No, he does, he's not, he's not a s-
he's not, no, no-no-no.
124.

DOUG
He's, he's a, I tell you, he's a
close talker. He's a close talker.

MARK
Yes.

DOUG
Yeah, yeah.

MARK
That's probably why he's so
successful.

JUDY
But he's, yes.

MARK.
‘Cause everything just--

DOUG
I was telling her in the car ride
over here that I'm, I'm, I'm
actually very exci-- I mean, I
think he's gonna be a great contact
for me, don't you think?

JUDY
He's, he's a wonderful man.

Vicky steps toward the group and gestures at them.
VICKY

I'm gonna go check out the food.
Does anyone want anything?

JUDY
I mean....

DOUG
No.

MARK

No, I'm fine, I guess.

JUDY
No, thank you, thank you.

Doug kisses Judy.

Vicky walks toward the house.
125.

JUDY (cont’d)
No, thank you.

MARK
Coming up.

DOUG
But he gets in your face.

JUDY
No-no-no, I mean, he'll get a
little close, but not that close.
But his...

Vicky walks toward a buffet table. Juan Antonio is standing
near the table.

JUAN ANTONIO
Hello.

Vicky turns and looks at Juan Antonio with surprise.

VICKY
Oh. Hello.

JUAN ANTONIO
I'm surprised to see you.

VICKY
As am I to see you. I didn't think
you liked parties.

JUAN ANTONIO
Yeah, well, Gabriella insisted that
I come and she's an old friend. You
know, of course, that Cristina and
I are no longer together, right?

VICKY
Yes. So now you're just with your
ex-wife?

JUAN ANTONIO
No, Maria Elena is gone as well.

VICKY
Oh. For now.

Juan Antonio nods, then shakes his head.
126.

JUAN ANTONIO

Eh, uh, it's funny. Um, Maria Elena
and I...we are meant for each other
and not meant for each other.
It's...it's a contradiction. I
mean, in order to understand it,
you need a poet, like my father

(chuckles softly)
Because I don't.

VICKY
Well.

JUAN ANTONIO
How about you? All goes well with
your husband, I'm sure?

VICKY
Oh, yes, yes, he's wonderful. He's
terrific. I'm, I'm
quite...delighted with the way
things turned out.

JUAN ANTONIO
Why don't I believe you?

VICKY
Uh...don't become flirtatious. You
know, I realize your, your bed is
empty now and you always had a
little yen for me, but...we're
preparing to leave by the weekend,
so I--

JUAN ANTONIO
Meet me for lunch.

VICKY
I'm too scared.

INT. NASH HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vicky looks at a mirror and rubs cream under her eye. Doug
stands in the bathroom talking into a cell phone. They are
both dressed in their underwear.

DOUG
(into cell phone)
No. What? I, you're, you're
breaking up, Tom. That you're
breaking up. Where are you?
127.

Vicky looks down wistfully.

DOUG (cont’d)
(into cell phone)
Okay. That's better. That's better.
Yeah, just try to stand still. Can
you hear me?

EXT. MARKET - DAY

Doug and Vicky look at a bird in a cage hanging from one of
the stalls in the market.

DOUG

We have to get a bird for...
VICKY

(chuckles)

Uh, no...
DOUG

...Mark and Judy.
VICKY

...we can't get ‘em a bird.
DOUG

Why not?
VICKY

It's ridiculous.

DOUG
God, they're beautiful. I always, I
always wanted a bird. You know, we
should actually, when we get home,
I'd love to get, like, a bird for
the new house.

VICKY
Yeah?

DOUG
Yeah. I, and you know, I'm, I'm
leaning towards Bedford Hills.
Vicky chuckles.

DOUG (cont’d)
What do you think?

Vicky’s cell phone RINGS.
128.

VICKY
Yeah, I, yeah. Oh, I-- Hold on.

Vicky takes her cell phone out of her purse and looks at it

Look, look, I'm not the kind of man
who would try to come between a
husband and wife. I'm not. I'm not.
But Judy Nash called me and she
tells me that you are not happy,
that you are actually more in love
with me than the man you married.

EXT. MARKET - SAME
VICKY
(into cell phone)
I can't talk.
Vicky hangs up the phone and puts it into her purse. Vicky
walks back to Doug, who’s standing by the bird cage. He holds
up a souvenir made of straw.

DOUG
This is nice.

A STREET VENDOR approaches Doug.

DOUG (cont’d)
Yeah, really nice, yeah.

STREET VENDOR
She is nice.

Vicky embraces Doug.

VICKY
Hey, what's that?

DOUG
Hey, babe. What do you think?

Doug looks at the price tag on the souvenir.

DOUG (cont’d)
Who was that?

VICKY
Hm?

DOUG
On the phone.

VICKY
Oh, it was, uh, it was my, uh,
language teacher.

DOUG
Yeah?

VICKY
He wants me to have a good-bye
lunch with him tomorrow at, at
noon.

Doug puts the souvenir back on the rack.
DOUG

Oh, that's perfect. I'm gonna play

golf with Mark in the morning.
INT. NASH HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

her.

JUAN ANTONIO
Uh...if you'd like to. Uh....
131.

VICKY
Sure.

Vicky and Juan Antonio walk into the studio, where there are
a number of Juan Antonio’s paintings piled up against the
walls.

JUAN ANTONIO
Uh, well, this is...uh, no, yeah
I've been working on these ones
lately. And...uh, yeah.

VICKY
Oh, they're very overwhelming.

JUAN ANTONIO
This is....

VICKY
Oh, my God.

JUAN ANTONIO
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's very hard
to explain a painting, right?

Juan Antonio picks up one of his paintings.

VICKY
No, you don't have to. It's, it's
fascinating. It's fascinating.

JUAN ANTONIO
This one, actually, should be...the
other way around, but....Uh...

VICKY
No, I, I like it very much. Can,
can I, uh...can I be frank about
something?

JUAN ANTONIO
Yeah.

Vicky gestures at a painting, which is filled with violent
swirls of black and white.

VICKY
This one-- it's, uh...it's, uh,
there's something very frightening
about...it.
132.

JUAN ANTONIO
Uh...well, that one is Maria
Elena's.

Juan Antonio rubs up against Vicky’s back as she gestures at
the painting.

VICKY
Right, well, that explains it.
It's very chaotic and...er-erratic
al-almost. But, uh....

Juan Antonio steps up behind Vicky and embraces her tightly.

VICKY (cont’d)
Oh, God, what am I doing here? I
don't know what I expect to happen.

JUAN ANTONIO
It's been, it's been...a long time
since we made love that night in
Oviedo.

Vicky turns toward Juan Antonio and nods.

VICKY
Y-Yes, I--

JUAN ANTONIO
And I've thought about it many,
many times.

VICKY
Yeah, well, I'm sure you weren't
thinking about it when you were
making love to Cristina or, or
Maria Elena.

Juan Antonio caresses her hair.

JUAN ANTONIO
Well, I, I never lied to you. I, I
mean, I told you from the first
moment I was attracted to both you
and Cristina.

VICKY
Yeah, I-I, look, I'm....

Vicky steps away and clasps her hand to her face.
133.

VICKY (cont’d)
I, I can't just go to bed with you.
I'm...I'm not good at this.

JUAN ANTONIO
But you weren't nervous that night.

VICKY
I wasn't married.

JUAN ANTONIO
You were about to be.

VICKY
Yeah. You're right. It's what I
want.

Vicky shakes her head an Juan Antonio.

VICKY (cont’d)
But I-- What, what am I supposed to
do? M-Make love with you and then
and then go on with my marriage
like, like nothing happened? Or,
or just terminate it?

JUAN ANTONIO
Judy Nash says you are heading an
unhappy life.

VICKY
Yeah, well, I, eh, she's talking
about herself.

Juan Antonio shakes his head at Vicky, then runs his finger
along her neck.

JUAN ANTONIO
But...maybe you will understand
more about your own feelings once
we've made love.

VICKY
Yeah, or less. Uh, look, I, I, I'm
not saying I'm not tempted...

Vicky leans toward Juan Antonio.
134.

VICKY (cont’d)
...but it would require such an
upheaval, emotionally, and, and
from a practical point of view,
you, you're not exactly the kind of
man to plan a, a...

Vicky and Juan Antonio kiss passionately.

VICKY (cont’d)
...future with.

A GUNSHOT is heard.

Juan Antonio and Vicky turn toward the noise and see Maria
Elena holding a pistol. Maria Elena SHOOTS the pistol again
at Juan Antonio and Vicky.

Oh, my God! Oh my God, no!

Maria Elena.

You're both complete--

JUAN ANTONIO
Are you okay? Let me help you.

VICKY
Both of you are completely insane!

JUAN ANTONIO

I'm sorry.

VICKY
I, I can't live like this!

INT. NASH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY

Doug and Vicky are seen through the windows walking across
the terrace.

DOUG
...understand what your language
teacher was doing with a gun.

VICKY
...he, he collects these antique
firearms and he was showing me his
favorite one and it, it just went
off.

Doug slaps his hands together angrily.

DOUG
Oh, my God! We should sue him! That
is so damn irresponsible!

Vicky and Doug stop on the terrace. Vicky turns toward him.

VICKY
No, no, it's not, it's not that
bad, honestly.

DOUG
Jesus.

VICKY
Once the bandages come off, it'll
be, it'll be a scratch.

NARRATOR (V.0.)
When Cristina returned from
Antibes, Vicky told her the whole
tale, and Cristina thought it was
sad how much Vicky had wanted Juan
Antonio and was unable to say or do
anything about it.

CRISTINA
...But I would have stepped aside.

VICKY
No, no, look...I, I knew you had
feelings for Juan Antonio from the
moment you saw him.
140.

CRISTINA
But if I knew what had happened, I
never would have gone ahead with
it.

VICKY
Well, look, it was...it was a...a
passing thing. Now it's over.

Cristina looks thoughtfully at Vicky. Vicky looks uncertainly
at Cristina.

settled on, and to lead the life
she had envisioned for herself
before the summer in Barcelona.
Cristina continued searching,
certain only of what she didn't
want.
