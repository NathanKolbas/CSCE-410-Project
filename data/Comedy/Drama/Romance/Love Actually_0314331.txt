LOVE ACTUALLY

INT. HEATHROW ARRIVALS GATE. DAY. 1
A VOICEOVER IN DARKNESS...

PM (V.O.)
“ Whenever I get gloomy with the state of
the world, I think about the Arrival Gate
at Heathrow Airport..

AND WE START TO SEE THIS — AS ‘STYLISH BUT REAL’ DOCUMENTARY AS
POSSIBLE, THE MOST MISCELLANEOUS OF GROUPS AND COUPLES AT THE
ARRIVAL GATE, ALL KISSING, ALL FULL OF AFFECTION AND EMOTION...

General opinion’s starting to make out that
we live in a world of hatred and greed —
but I don’t see that - seems to me that
love is everywhere. Often it’s not
particularly dignified, or newsworthy — but
it’s always there — fathers & sons, mothers
& daughters, husbands & wives, friends &
strangers. When the planes hit the Twin
Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone
calls from the people about to die were
messages of hate and revenge - they were
all messages of love. If you look for it,
I’ve got a nasty suspicion you’1l find that
love actually is all around....

INT. CHURCH. DAY 2

CUT TO TWO MEN’S FACES. WELL DRESSED UP IN WEDDING TIES AND
COATS.

PETER
No surprises?

MARK
No surprises.

PULL BACK — THEY ARE BEST MAN AND GROOM WAITING AT THE END OF AN
AISLE. THE CHURCH IS SUNNY AND FULL.

. PETER
Not like the stag night?

MARK
Unlike the stag night.

PETER
Do you admit that the Brazilian prostitutes
were a mistake?

(CONTINUED)
Page2
2 CONTINUED: 2

MARK
I do.

PETER
And it would have been much better if
they’d not turned out to be men?

MARK
That is true.

THE MUSIC STARTS UP... PACHELBEL’S CANON. ENTER A REALLY LOVELY,
OPTIMISTIC GIRL IN HER WEDDING DRESS. THIS IS JULIET.

MARK (CONT'D)
Good luck, kiddo.

AND HE PICKS UP HIS VIDEO AND STARTS DISCREETLY TO FILM
PROCEEDINGS ~ IT’S ONE OF THOSE WHERE YOU CAN VIEW THROUGH A
SCREEN, RATHER THAN HOLDING IT TO YOUR EYE.

AS THE BRIDE WALKS UP THE AISLE A SWEET, SLIGHTLY CHAOTIC 30
YEAR OLD, CALLED SARAH, SNEAKS IN JUST BEHIND HER, SWITCHING OFF
AND PUTTING AWAY HER MOBILE PHONE. SHE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A
FRIEND CALLED JAMIE. 38. GOOD-LOOKING AND GOOD-NATURED.

THE BRIDE GOES ON WALKING — EXCHANGING A BLISSFUL SMILE WITH HER
HUSBAND TO BE.

WE CUT THROUGH MOMENTS OF THE WEDDING SERVICE — FINGERS, RINGS,
KISS, BIBLES, SIGNING THE REGISTRY. IT’S NOW THE END OF THE
SERVICE - THEY'RE BACK IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR.

PETER
And you resisted the temptation for any
surprises?

MARK
Yes. I’m mature now.

NOW BRIDE AND GROOM TURN AND HEAD DOWN THE AISLE. THE ORGAN
STRIKES UP A TRADITIONAL CHURCH EXIT SONG. THEN IT CHANGES... AND
STARTS TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE THE
MARSEILLAISE. PETER LOOKS A BIT SURPRISED — TURNS TO LOOK AT
MARK, WHO LOOKS INNOCENT.

AS THE MUSIC CHANGES, A CURTAIN THAT HAS BEEN HIDING THE
CONTENTS OF THE BALCONY DROPS. BEHIND IT IS A HUNDRED STRONG
CHOIR. THEY BEGIN TO SING

CHOIR
Love, love, love.
Love, love, love.
Love, love, love.

(CONTINUED)

THE CHOIR THEN PART TO REVEAL A FABULOUS LOOKING SINGER,
STANDING AT A MICROPHONE ~ SINGING ‘ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE’.

SINGER
Nothing you can do that can’t be done.
Nothing you can sing that can’t be sung.
Nothing you can say but you can learn how
to play the game.
It’s easy.

ALL
All you need is love...

THEY ARE NOW JOINED, DURING THE CHORUS, — MAGICALLY FROM ALL
OVER THE CHURCH — BY A HUGE BRASS SECTION — 20 TRUMPETS — 20
SAXOPHONES ETC... THEY ACTUALLY APPEAR IN THE PEWS WHERE THEY’ VE
BEEN HIDING THEIR INSTRUMENTS TILL NOW.

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need.
THE BRIDE, JULIET, IS RADIANT — ADORING IT...

JULIET
Did you do this?

PETER
Christ no.

HUSBAND PETER LOOKS AT BEST MAN MARK. MARK SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS,
PRETENDING HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
THEN A LITTLE SMILE.

3 EXT. CHURCH. DAY 3
THEY OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE CHURCH. WIND MACHINES BLOW 5,000
ROSE PETALS THROUGH THE SKY. A MAN IS PLAYING LEAD GUITAR,
STANDING ON A GRAVESTONE. THEY ARE THE HAPPIEST, LAUGHINGEST
COUPLE IN THE WORLD.

A TITLE CARD SAYS...
NOVEMBER. LONDON.

4 EXT. LONDON. DAY. 4
SOME BEAUTIFUL SHOTS OF THE CITY IN ITS WINTER GLORY.

CUT TO A FUNERAL — A MAN AND HIS 11 YEAR OLD STEP-SON IN A
CHURCH - WITH A CROWD OF 80 BEHIND THEM, DRESSED IN BLACK.

PRIEST
And now Daniel wishes to say one last
thing.

DANIEL GETS UP AND FACES THE GUESTS. BEHIND HIM A SIMPLE SLIDE-
PROJECTOR SCREEN SHOWS A PORTRAIT OF HIS WIFE.

DANIEL
As you know, Jo and I had a lot of time to
prepare for this moment. Some of her
requests, for instance, that I should bring
Nicole Kidman as my date to the funeral,
I'm confident she expected me to ignore.
But others she was pretty damn clear about.
When she first mentioned what’s about to
happen, I said ‘Over my dead body’ and she
said “No, Danny - over mine.” And, as
usual, my darling girl, and Sam’s darling
Mum was right - 100%. So she’s going to say
her final farewell to you, not through me —
but, inevitably, ever-so-coolly, through
the immortal genius of the Bay City
Rollers...

THROUGH THE SPEAKERS WHAMS THE BAY CITY ROLLERS ATROCIOUS COVER
VERSION: THE PROJECTOR SCREEN SHOWS TERRIBLE SHOTS OF THE
ROLLERS IN THEIR HEYDAY, MORE SHOTS OF JO - AND THEN SETTLES ON
AN UTTERLY GLEEFUL 12 YEAR OLD GIRL, CLEARLY JO - TOTALLY DECKED
IN THE SCARF, BADGES AND HATS OF ROLLERMANIA.

If you hate me after what I say,
Can’t put it off any longer
Oov00 9000 C000

I just gotta tell you anyway...
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye,

Bye baby, baby, bye bye

Bye bye baby, don’t make me cry,
Bye baby, baby bye bye...

THE CONGREGATION ARE TORN BETWEEN SMILES AT THE SONG AND THE
STILLS, AND THE REAL SADNESS OF IT ALL.

MORE TITLES...
INT. JAMIE’S HOUSE. DAY 6

JAMIE, WHO WE GLIMPSED AT THE WEDDING, COMES BACK INTO A HOUSE.
HE HAS A SLIGHT, TOUCHING, MID-SENTENCE STUTTER.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 6

HE UNLOCKS THE DOOR INTO THE LARGE LIVING ROOM. AT THAT MOMENT
ANOTHER SLIGHTLY YOUNGER MAN ENTERS THE ROOM THROUGH AN INTERNAL
DOOR.

JAMIE
Hello. What the hell are you doing here?
CHRIS
O, I just popped over to borrow some old
CDs.
JAMIE
Did the lady of the house let you in?
CHRIS
Yeh.
JAMIE

Lovely obliging gi-gi-girl. Just thought
I'd pop back before the reception, see if
she was feeling better. Look, I was
thinking that maybe we should take Mum out
for her birthday on Friday - what do you
think? I feel we’ve been bad sons this

year.

CHRIS
Okay, that sounds fine — bit boring but
fine.

THERE’S A CALL FROM OFF.

GIRL (v/0O)
Put the kettle on will you, darling.

JAMIE
(RAISING HIS EYEBROWS) I’m a slave to love.

HE STARTS TO DO SO - AND THEN CONTINUES TO DO SO, SORT OF IN
SLOW MOTION, AS HE TALKS ON...

This is a bit odd, actually. My girlfriend
doesn’t know I’m here — and she calls you
‘Chris’ — not ‘da-da-darling’ ~ unless she
calls you., ‘darling’ when I’m not here — in
which case the reason you're here is
probably less to do with borrowing, let’s
say, an old Paul Simon album and more to do
with, let’s say, you having sex with my
girlfriend when I’m out.

CHRIS
Jamie — what can I say?

(CONTINUED)

JAMIE
Well, you could say ‘it’s not true — I AM
here because I had a passionate craving for
the music of Art Ga-ga-garfunkel’s best
friend.’

GIRL (V/0) .
Forget the tea, babe — I’ve located a
packet of 3 — if you get a move on we can
finish them off by the time old pencil-dick
comes home.

JAMIE
On the other hand maybe you co-co-couldn’t
honestly say that..

EXT. DOWNING STREET. DAY. 8

HE ENTERS — THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM

INT. 10 DOWNING STREET - ENTRANCE HALL/INNER LOBBY. DAY. 9

SUDDENLY, BIZARRE SILENCE AND FORMALITY INSIDE IN COMPARISON TO
THE CHAOS OUTSIDE.

Yes. Anything to put off actually running

HE GOES ALONG A LINE OF EMPLOYEES.

ANNIE
This is Terence.

TERENCE
Good morning, sir.

PM
Had an uncle called Terence — hated him —
think he was a pervert - like the look of
you, though...

PAT
Good morning, sir, I’m Pat. Housekeeper.

PM
Hello, Pat - should be a lot easier with me
than the last lot - no nappies, no
teenagers, no scary wife.

ANNIE
And this is Natalie - she’s new, like you.

PM
Hello, Natalie.

NATALIE
Hello, David. I mean ‘sir’ — O shit, I
can’t believe I said that.. O no - and now
I’ve gone and said ‘shit’ - twice. I’m so
sorry, sir.

PM
That’s fine... You could have said ‘fuck’
and then we would have been in real
trouble.

NATALIE
Thank you, sir. I did have an awful
premonition I was going to fuck up on my
fir.. o piss it..

HE LAUGHS. SHE BLUSHES HUGELY — A BEAUTIFUL LOVELY, YOUNG,
BRIGHT FACED GIRL. HE LOOKS AT HER. SOMETHING’S HAPPENING.

NATALIE IS ONE OF THE THINGS HE LOOKS BACK ON.

INT. PM’S OFFICE.10 DOWNING STREET. DAY. 10

PM ENTERS, AND CLOSES THE DOOR AND SUDDENLY PINS HIMSELF BACK

PM
O no. O Jesus. Bugger. That is genuinely
bad timing.

IT’S THE RECEPTION OF THE ‘ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE’ WEDDING. LATER

BAND...

OUR BEST MAN, MARK, IS FILMING THEM. NEAR HIM IS SARAH, STILL
TALKING ON HER MOBILE PHONE. A PERKY WAITER IN A MESSY BLACK TIE
APPROACHES HIM - HE’S CALLED COLIN.

COLIN
Delicious delicacy?

MARK
No thanks.

COLIN HEADS ON TO SARAH.

COLIN
Taste explosion?

TOTALLY UNCHARMED, SHE JUST SHAKES HER HEAD. COLIN HEADS OFF
DISCOURAGED. SEES ANOTHER PRETTY GIRL BY THE DOOR TO THE

Yeh - bit dodgy, isn’t it. Looks like an

I’m Colin, by the way.

PRETTY GIRL
I’m Nancy.

COLIN
How do you fit here - bride, groom, vicar’s
bit on the side?

PRETTY GIRL
No, I did the food.

COLIN
Groovy. (EATS ANOTHER CANAPE) Yes - yes -
yum - second time, the glory of it just
hits you between the eyes.

HE CLIPS THROUGH THE DOORS INTO THE KITCHEN,
INT. RECEPTION KITCHEN. NIGHT. 12

COLIN SITS DOWN NEXT TO ANOTHER QUITE GEEKY GUY, CALLED TONY, A
FRIEND WHO’S JUST COME ALONG FOR THE RIDE. HE WEARS NORMAL
CLOTHES.

COLIN
At last I’ve worked out why I can never
find true love.

TONY
Why’s that?

COLIN
It’s not me - it’s English girls. They’re
stuck up, you see — and I’m primarily
attractive to girls who are, you know,
cooler, game for a laugh — like American
girls. So I should just go to America — I’d
get a girlfriend there instantly. What do
you think?

TONY
I think it’s crap, Colin. People are the
same the world over — wherever you go,
you'll still be dull and ugly — and girls
will still hate you.

No, that’s where you're wrong. American
girls would seriously dig me with my cute
British accent.

TONY
You don’t have a cute British accent.

COLIN
Yes, I do, I'm going to America.

TONY
Don’t act on this whim, Colin. You’re a
lonely, ugly arsehole, and you must accept
it.

COLIN
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex. I’m just on
the wrong continent, that’s all.

HE WINKS AT A PASSING WAITRESS. SHE TOTALLY FREEZES HIM OUT.
THEY BOTH THINK IT PROVES THEIR POINT.

COLIN/TONY

TUNE — THE BAND ISN’T THE BEST IN THE WORLD. MARK IS FILMING
THEM — SARAH, THE PHONE GIRL, COMES AND SITS NEXT TO HIM. SHE
WATCHES HIM CURIOUSLY, THEN GENTLY...

SARAH
Do you love him?

MARK
Sorry? Who? What?

SARAH
No ~ I just thought I'd ask the blunt
question, in case it was the right one and
you needed to talk to someone about it and
no-one had ever asked you so you’d never
been able to talk about it even though you
might have wanted to....

MARK
No, no, ‘no’ is the answer. No. Absolutely
not.

So that’s a ‘no’ then.

I was hoping you’d win — though of cours
I'd have been perfectly friendly to the

KAREN
0, I don’t know about that. It’s just that
these days they probably don’t have wings —
so we don’t recognise them. They probably
just look normal like you or me - but still
cunningly wander around doing good.

BERNIE
In our play they don’t do any good at all —
they just stand there looking like poofs
and saying ‘Isn’t Baby Jesus great’ when
everyone knows he’s just a stupid doll. I
want to be a lobster. (HE WALKS OFF) And,
by the way, Toby says Uncle David is a

And I’m afraid, you know, that there’s
something really wrong — I mean clearly
it’s about his Mum, but Christ, he might be
injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all
I know.

QUITE A SERIOUS MAN - BUT WITH HIDDEN PLACES.

MEL
Sarah for you.

HARRY
O great. Settling in fine?

MEL
Absolutely.

SARAH WALKS IN A BIT AWKWARDLY. MEL LEAVES GRACEFULLY.

HARRY
Ah, Sarah. How are you?

SARAH
Good - the quality of my work has shot up
since I got that Harry Potter screen-saver.

HARRY
I’ve noticed - now, switch off your phone
and tell me exactly how long you’ve been
working here?

SARAH
It’s 2 years now. And 7 months. And 3 days.
And I suppose, what — 2 hours.

HARRY
Right. And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic but attractive
chief designer?

SARAH IS TAKEN ABACK — SHE THOUGHT THIS WAS A TOTAL SECRET.

SARAH
Ahm — 2 years and 7 months and 3 days and,
I suppose,1 hour and 45 minutes. There was
a great half hour at the beginning that was
very relaxed.

HARRY
I thought as much.

SARAH
Do you think everybody knows?

HARRY
Yes.

HARRY
Yes.
SARAH

That is bad news on, o, so many levels.

HARRY
And I was just thinking perhaps the time
had come to do something about it...

KAREN
Like...?

HARRY
You know, ask him out for a drink — then
after 20 minutes casually drop into the
_ conversation the fact that you’d like to
marry him and have lots of sex and babies.

SARAH
You know that?

HARRY
Yes. And so does Karl. Think about it. For
all our sakes.

SARAH
Certainly — excellent. Will do. Thanks,
boss.

SHE OPENS THE DOOR TO LEAVE AND A VERY GOOD LOOKING GUY WALKS

and now I’m left with no-one, wrinkled and

alone.
MIKE

Wow. Thanks for that, Billy.
BILLY

For what? .
MIKE

Well, for actually giving a real answer to
a question. Doesn't often happen here on
Radio Wapping, I can tell you.

BILLY
Ask me anything you like — I’1l1 tell you
the truth.

MIKE

Best shag you ever had?

BILLY
Britney Spears — no, only kidding... She was
rubbish. No, only kidding...

MIKE
Okay - here’s one - how do you think the
new record compares to your old stuff?

BILLY
Come on , Mike, you know as well as I do
that the record’s crap. But you know..

CUT TO JOE’S V. UNHAPPY REACTION.

wouldn’t it be great if Number One this
Christmas wasn’t some smug teenager — but
an ugly old ex-heroin addict searching for
a come-back at any price. All these young
popsters, come Christmas day, they’11 be
stretched out naked with a cute bird
balancing on their balls — but I’11l be
stuck in a seedy hotel with my manager Joe -

MIKE
I think you’re referring to “If you really
love Christmas”

BILLY
I am indeed, Mike. “Come on and let it
snow”, Ouch.

MIKE
So here it is one more time — the dark

THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR COMES UP. HE IS TONY, COLIN’S
DISCOURAGING FRIEND. HE IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH HIS JOB AT
THIS MOMENT.

TONY
Judy ~— could you, ahm, take the top off
this time — lighting and camera need to
know when we're actually going to see the
nipples and when we’re not - you know,
shadows and things.

JUDY
O yes, okay, right. (TO JOHN) At least it’s
nice and warm in here.

JOHN
Absolutely. You’ve got to be ready for
anything in this job, don’t you. I was once
standing in for Brad Pitt, and...

TONY
Unfortunately we're going to have to hurry.
We need to shoot the actors before lunch.

JUDY
Fine.

JOHN
I promise I won't look.

SHE LAUGHS A BIT, THEN TAKES HER JUMPER AND BRA OFF — PULLING A
BIT OF A ‘WHAT CAN YOU DO?’ LOOK AT JOHN. “AND ACTION” THEN THEY
START TO MIME THE SEX AGAIN. THE CAMERAMAN STANDS VERY CLOSE,
JUDGING THE LIGHT WITH HIS LITTLE MACHINE.

TONY
And Jerry says, could you just put your
hands on her breasts...

HE DOES SO.

And massage them, please.

JOHN
Right.... It’s Junction 13 that’s just
murder, isn’t it - total gridlock there

Minister?

JUDY

O, I like him — can’t understand why he’s

JOHN

Either that or gay.

TONY
And, Judy, if you could just cheat the

PAUSE.

PM
Love that word ‘relationship — covers all
manner of sins doesn’t it? I greeted the
President knowing there couldn’t be
equality with America — but I wasn’t
prepared for a total lack of give and take.
I fear this has become a bad relationship
— a relationship based on the President
taking exactly what he wants — and casually
ignoring those things that really matter
to.. Britain. We may be a small country but
we're a great country too, and a friend who
bullies us is no longer a friend. And since
bullies only respond to strength — from
this moment on, I will be more prepared to
be less friendly. And the President should
be prepared for that.

HUGE EXCITED PHOTOGRAPHING AND WRITING FROM THE PRESS — THIS IS

Well, I think it’s the best party venue

LARGE PHOTO OF FOUR BLACK PENISES

O Jesus ~ I’ve got to go see the scary
headmistress — Bernie’s in trouble again.

HARRY
Don’t tell me.

KAREN
Take my advice, Mel - don’t marry. You give
up work, lose your looks and pour all your
life and love into children who turn out
to be total bastards. Or certainly the boys
do. Nice to meet you. (TO HARRY) See you

SHE KISSES HARRY AND HEADS OUT. AND PASSES, IN THE DOOR, PETER,
BACK FROM THE HONEYMOON. MARK IS THRILLED.

MARK
Pedro! Hey! Good to see you. (THEY HUG) How
are you, you ugly bastard?

PETER
Good. A huge relief to be back — all that
sex wears a man out. Mel - dangerous
perfection as always. (HE SPIES THE PHOTOS)

HEADMISTRESS
Bernard was asked to write an essay for
Religious Education about his Christmas
Wish...

KAREN
Right.
HEADMISTRESS

An apparently charming subject. But not for
Bernard. Mr Trench.

SHE HANDS OVER TO THE BOY’S R.E. TEACHER.

MR TRENCH
We have had some excellent essays. Many
concentrated on a world at peace...

Excellent...

MR TRENCH
And there was one very touching one by a
young boy with a very sick sister — just
wishing that she could for just one day,
for Christmas day, be well again.

KAREN
I do hope that happens.

I have thought long and hard about what I

left me & Mr Trench waiting like a pair of
spare parts for 10 minutes before we
realised they’d quite simply buggered off.

GERALDINE
How splendid. Teach you to be so pompous —
I bet the essay was excellent.

Well, actually to be honest, it did have
its amusing side. His Christmas wish was to
see people's farts.

Bravo. That's my Christmas wish too.

MARK
Hi. (DUTIFULLY) How was the honeymoon?
JULIET
It was great. And thanks for the gorgeous

send-off.
SHE IS MAKING THE CALL FROM HER OFFICE. PAUSE.

MARK
So what can I do for you?

JULIET
It’s only a tiny favour. I’ve just tried
the wedding video and it’s a disaster —
it’s come out all blue and wibbly.

MARK
I’m sorry.

JULIET
And I remember you filming a lot on the day
- and I just wondered if I could look at
your stuff.

MARK
O no - look — to be honest, I didn’t
really...

WHILE HE IS TALKING MORE AND MORE SCHOOLGIRLS COME IN. IT’S LIKE
THE BIRDS IN ‘THE BIRDS’ EVERY TIME WE CUT ROUND, THERE ARE 10
MORE THERE.

JULIET
Please. All I want is just one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn’t turquoise.
You must at least have 10 seconds of that.

PAUSE. THE PLACE IS NOW REALLY PACKED WITH 50 GIGGLING,
UNIFORMED SCHOOLGIRLS.

MARK
Okay - I’1l have a look - but to be honest
I think I might have wiped it, so don’t get
any hopes up. Must go. (HE HANGS UP. NOT
HAPPY. ADDRESSES THE GIRLS) Okay — very
funny. Unless you have £3,000 and are
willing to waste it on total pornography,
get out now...

So - ahm - what do you need - something
along the stationery line - are you short
of staplers?

MEL
No, I want something I don’t need. I want
something I want. Something pretty.

HARRY
Right. Right....

HE CLOSES HIS PHONE — DISTURBED BY THIS EXCHANGE. THEN SPOTS
KAREN IN THE CROWD AND WAVES.

KAREN
Sorry I’m late ~ had to drop Bernie off for
rehearsal.

HARRY
Is he still traumatised by not being a
crustacean?

KAREN
He says only total mingers believe in
angels. Quite right. Clever child.

' THEY HEAD INTO THE BIG STORE — SELFRIDGES AS IT WERE...

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE. DAY. 108

KAREN
Keep yourself occupied for 10 minutes while
I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

SHE KISSES HIM AND HEADS OFF. HE QUICKLY LOOKS AROUND — AND SEES
THE JEWELLERY SECTION. PAUSES — AND HEADS FOR IT FAST. REACHES A
COUNTER. SEES EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. THERE’S A QUEUE. DAMN. THEN
SUDDENLY, A NEW VOICE...

ASSISTANT — RUFUS.
Looking for anything in particular, sir?

HE IS A VERY PARTICULAR LOOKING MAN, VERY ACCURATE, SLIGHTLY
CAMP, WITH A VERY PARTICULAR TIE.

HARRY
Yes... Ahm. That necklace there.. how much
is it?

RUFUS
It's £370.

Wow. (THIS IS A MORAL AS WELL AS FINANCIAL

IT IS A BEAUTIFUL, DELICATE GOLD HEART NECKLACE.

RUFUS
Do you want it gift-wrapped?

HARRY
Yes, why not.

RUFUS.
Indeed.

HE TAKES THE NECKLACE OUT — AND PUTS IT DOWN ON A LITTLE BLUE
PAD. THEN TURNS, OPENS A DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT A LITTLE BOX.

RUFUS
There we go. Just pop this in here...

PUTS THE NECKLACE ON IT — PLACING IT TENDERLY — RE-ORGANISING IT
A BIT. THEN GETS THE TOP OF THE BOX AND PUTS IT ON.

HARRY
Excellent.

RUFUS.
Not quite finished.

THIS MAKES HARRY A LITTLE TENSE. RUFUS DOESN’T NOTICE — BUT GOES
OVER TO A VARIETY OF RIBBONS.

RUFUS
Blue or burgundy?

HARRY
Ahm, blue, will be fine. Look, if we could
be quite quick.

RUFUS
Certainly, sir. Ready in the flashiest of
flashes.

IN A VERY TRAINED MANNER HE CUTS TWO FEET OF THE RIBBON — WRAPS
IT ROUND THE BOX — THEN WRAPS IT ROUND AGAIN. THEN TIES IT.

HARRY
That’s great.
RUEUS

HARRY VERY TENSE NOW, BUT IT’S THE FINAL FLOURISH.

HARRY (CONT'D)
That’s great.

RUFUS TURNS AND OPENS ANOTHER DRAWER — AND TAKES OUT A SEE-
THROUGH CELLOPHANE BAG

HARRY (CONT'D)
O Jesus. Actually, I don’t need a bag — I
can just put it in my pocket.

RUFUS
This isn’t a bag, sir.
HARRY
Really?
RUFUS

No, sir - this is so much more than a bag.

HE OPENS THE BAG, TURNS, AND OPENS ANOTHER DRAWER, AND TAKES OUT
LITTLE DRIED ROSES — AND THEN SOME LAVENDER — AND SPRINKLES THEM
IN THE BAG. HARRY LOOKS AT HIS WATCH — AND STARTS TO LOOK
WORRIEDLY AT PEOPLE COMING DOWN THE LIFT.

HARRY
Could we be quick... please.

RUFUS
Certainly, sir. Prontissimo.

AND AT THAT MOMENT HIS MOBILE RINGS. HARRY GETTING VERY
EXASPERATED NOW.

Just a moment, please, sir. (HE ANSWERS)
Hello-o. O hello, Gabriel - yes, I’m sure
it is, but I’m afraid I'11 have to call you
back. Bye now. (TO HARRY) Sorry, sir. Now,
just....

RUFUS TWISTS THE TOP OF THE BAG. THEN HE TURNS AROUND AND OPENS
ANOTHER DRAWER — AND TAKES OUT A FOUR INCH STICK OF CINNAMON.

HE TWISTS THE CINNAMON STICK AND TIES IT ON.

RUFUS (CONT'D)
There we go. Almost finished.

HARRY
Almost finished? What else can there be —
are you going to dip it in yoghurt and
cover it with chocolate buttons?

RUFUS

No, sir. Just pop it in this Christmas box.
HARRY

But I don’t WANT a Christmas box.
RUFUS

But you said you wanted it gift-wrapped.
HARRY

I did — but...
RUFUS

This is the final flourish, sir...

HARRY
© God. Can I just pay?

HE IS LOOKING DESPERATELY ROUND...

Whatever, there’s this big concert at the

played absolutely superbly, then there’s a

You used to clear the table for the only

Christmas Top of the Pops was on and you
could watch it in the kitchen.

That’s right. Couldn’t wash up enough.

That’s very much the kind of thing you

SAM
No - you know the score in romances -

DANIEL
Of course.

SAM

And it’s a rainy Christmas Eve in London

will it be the totally unexpected Christmas
sensation from Billy Mann?
Well, there’s only two records to go in our

Number two at Christmas this year... (LONG,

BILLY
Hello.

RADIO 1 DJ

We're live across the nation and you're
number one. How do you feel?

BILLY
Well, as you know — I’m an enormous fan of
Westlife and the thought of those young
chaps not getting to number 1, well, it’s a
real heartbreaker.

RADIO 1 DJ.
And your real reaction, Bill?

BILLY
Fuck ‘em. I’m the king.

JOE LEAPS IN THE AIR.

AND THEN

JOE
HE'S THE KING!

BACKS AWAY IN EMBARRASSMENT.

RADIO 1 DJ
And how will you be celebrating?

BILLY
I don’t know — either I could behave like a
rock and roll loser and get drunk with my
fat manager — or when I hang up, I'll get
flooded by invitations to a large number of
glamorous parties.

RADIO 1 DJ.
Let’s hope it’s the latter. And here it is
— number one — from Billy Mann... It’s

Don’t give yourself away.

From give and take, and still somehow
It’s love’s illusions I recall,

Make my dreams come true —
All I want for Christmas is you.

OF THE STAGE, THINKING THEY ARE BACKSTAGE AND TOTALLY PRIVATE,
ARE THE PRIME MINISTER AND NATALIE KISSING — INSTANTLY OUT COME
THE CAMERAS OF EVERY SINGLE PARENT IN THE SCHOOL, IT IS A
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING OF FLASHES.. THERE IS NOTHING THE PM AND
NATALIE CAN DO. .

PM
Right. So not quite as private as we'd
hoped... What do we do....

THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER - THEN HE TURNS AND... TAKES A LITTLE
NERVOUS BOW.

. MARSEILLE. NIGHT. : 157

QUITE A LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE NOW WALKING THROUGH THE
BACKSTREETS — ABOUT 22 OF THEM — THEY’ VE BEEN COLLECTING AT
SISTER SOPHIA’S INSTIGATION. THEY TURN OUT ON TO THE HARBOUR -
AND THEN MOVE ALONG TO A RESTAURANT FACING THE WATER, AND BURST
INTO IT.

INT. RESTAURANT. MARSEILLE. NIGHT. 158
THERE IS A PROPRIETOR BEHIND THE BAR

MR BARROS
Where is Aurelia — this man has come to ask
her to marry him.

PROPRIETOR
He can’t do that — she’s our best waitress.

MR BARROS
Don’t be so selfish, Where is she?

PROPRIETOR
Why should I care, if she’s not going to
continue working here, the little tart?

AND AT THAT MOMENT AURELIA BACKS THROUGH THE DOOR HOLDING THREE

PLATES OF FOOD — SHE TURNS AND SEES JAMIE STANDING THERE. SHE

FREEZES. AND THEN VERY GENTLY PUTS THE FOOD DOWN — AND WIPES THE

MR BARROS
Get a move on, Mister.
JAMIE
Beautiful Aurelia - I’ve come here with a
view to asking you.. to marriage me.
CUT TO HER.
JAMIE (CONT'D)
I know I seems an insane person ~ because I
hardly know you — but sometimes things are
so transparency, they don’t need evidential
proof. I’d be very honoured if you would
make marriage with me, and I will habit
here, or you can come and habit with me in
England... :
SOPHIA
Definitely go for England, girl. You might
meet Prince William - then you can marry
him instead.
MR BARROS
Ssssh.
JAMIE
Of course I don’t expect you to be as
foolish as me, and of co-co-course I
prediction you say ‘no’ — but it’s
Christmas and I just wanted to... check.
PAUSE AS SHE THINKS.
SOPHIA
O for heaven’s sake say ‘yes’, you skinny
moron.

CUT BACK TO AURELIA AND BACK TO JAMIE. THEN — BECAUSE SHE TOO
HAS LEARNT THE LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON SHE LOVES, IN VERY BROKEN

ENGLISH.

Hey. Great show. Classic drumming.

Yeh, thanks. Plan didn’t work though.

DANIEL
Tell her then.

SAM
Tell her what?

DANIEL
Tell her that you love her.

SAM
No way! Anyway, they fly tonight.

DANIEL
Even better — you've got nothing to lose -
and you’1l always regret it if you don’t. I
never told your Mum enough — I should have

DANIEL TURNS AND BUMPS INTO SOMEONE — SHE IS A MOTHER WITH BOY —
SHE LOOKS WEIRDLY, SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE NICOLE KIDMAN, THOUGH
OBVIOUSLY IT ISN’T HER (THOUGH, IN FACT, IT IS) — THE TEETH, OR
HAIR COLOUR, SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG. SHE’S A VERY INDEPENDENT
LONDON MUM.

NICOLE
Sorry. I’m a daft, blind cow.

DANIEL
That’s okay. My fault.

NICOLE
No it wasn’t. You’re Sam's Dad, aren’t you?

DANIEL
Yes. Well, step-dad. Daniel.

NICOLE
I’m Carol. Tommy was second trumpet. Watch
out Louis Armstrong, I say.

DANIEL
I agree. Well done, kiddo - though I
prefer Chet Baker.

DEEP PAUSE. THE TWO ADULTS JUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

NICOLE

He's also the gymnast, isn’t he?

Yes ~ I was there for a minute or two — and
then I had an epiphany.

JOE
Really. Come in. And what was this
epiphany?

AS THEY HEAD UPSTAIRS AND INTO THE FLAT.

BILLY
It was about Christmas.

JOE
You realised that it was all around.

BILLY
No, I realised that Christmas is a time to
be with the people you love.

JOE
Right.

BILLY
And I realised that — as dire chance and
fateful cock-up would have it - here I am,
mid-fifties and without knowing it, I’ve
gone and spent most of my adult life with a
chubby employee. And as much as it grieves
me to say it, it might be that the people I
love is, in fact, you.

Well, this is a surprise.

And, to be honest, despite all my
complaining — it HAS been a wonderful life.
JOE IS ACTUALLY DEEPLY MOVED.
JOE
Well, thank you. Thanks, man. It’s been a
real honour. I feel very proud.
