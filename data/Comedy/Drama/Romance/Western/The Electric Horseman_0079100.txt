EXT. OPEN PLAINS - NEW MEXICO - DAY . L

An infinity of space. In the distance a cluster of in-
distinguishable shapes moves TOWARDS US. As they CLOSE
TO CAMERA, we SEE they are a pack of wild mustangs --

a stallion and nine mares running hard. They race PAST
CAMERA in a thundering blur.

EXT. A RACETRACK SOMEWHERE IN THE WEST - DAY 1A

A tight cluster of horses thunders into the home stretch.
In a sudden burst of speed, Number "7,"" a big bay with
black mane and tail, pulls away and moves up on the out-
side. The crowd goes wild!

BOOTH ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
Rising Star in his last race
before retirement. The most
spectacular stallion in the
history of the turf! -- Triple
Crown Winner -- With over 3.1/2
million in purses --

At the finish it's Rising Star by a nose.

BOOTH ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
(continuing)
He's done itl -- this marks his
twenty-seventh win ~- and what-

a-way-to-goll!!

EXT. RODEO GROUNDS - BRAHMA BULL AND RIDER - DAY 2

The bull at the top of his arc, all four feet off the
gound, The rider is SONNY STEELE, looking as if he were
welded to the bull's back. BUZZER SOUNDS the end of a
perfect ride, but as the fans jump to their feet, Sonny
continues his ride just-for-the-hell-of-it!! Then he
vaults off the beast landing on the balls of his feet,
with both arms raised triumphantly as the crowd goes
wild.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - SILVER CHAMPIONSHIP BELT BUCKLE 3

ZOOM BACK as the wearer, Sonny, charges his horse from
the chute, rides down on a running steer. CROWD SOUND
CARRIES OVER. Sonny drops expertly onto the horns and
pins the steer to the ground,
 

SPINNING RED LIGHT ATOP AN AMBULANCE - NIGHT 4

PULL BACK TO SEE the ambulance just off a rodeo arena.
Two cowboys carry the limp body of Sonny towards it.

As the cowboys are about to put him in, he comes to,
squirms out of their grasp, shekes his head to clear it,
and limps back toward the arena. CHEERING CONTINUES .

ANOTHER RODEO ARENA ~ NIGHT 5

Sonny atop a spinning, bucking saddle bronc. PUSH IN
until the spinning becomes a blur. SOUNDTRACK BEGINS
TO FADE SLOWLY.

EXT. WINNER'S PLATFORM - RODEO ARENA - NIGHT 6

Sonny, center stage, surrounded by well-wishers, is
handed another championship buckle. Smiling, he looks
from the new one to the one he is already wearing, then
- tosses the buckle affectionately to a pretty blonde girl
in the crowd. She catches it and holds it up with still
a third silver buckle. COLOR FADES SLOWLY from the
pieture and the SOUNDTRACK is now ONLY AN ECHO.

EXT. ANOTHER RODEO ARENA - ANOTHER BRAHMA BULL AND 7
SONNY - DAY

Picture is almost BLACK AND WHITE and there is NO
SOUND. The deadly ballet goes on in eerie silence.

INT. MAKESHIFT EMERGENCY ROOM - SMALL TOWN - NIGHT 8

Sonny lies on a medical table. Two doctors stitch up
his back. His hand dangles over the side of the table
clutching a can of Coors beer. Two cowboy faces are
visible through the glass door in b.g. The picture be-
gins to FLICKER and MOVE MORE SLOWLY.

EXT. SAME WINNER'S PLATFORM - RODEO ARENA - NIGHT 9

Sonny receives still another silver belt buckle, Film
slows further and moves forward jerkily. From the si-
lence comes a NEW SOUND: the CLICKING OF SPROCKETS.

A champagne cork silently pops and as the liquid sprays
over the frame, Sonny smiles a devastating smile.
FRAME FREEZES.

VOLCE
That's it!

PULL BACK QUICKLY TO SEE we have been looking at a
moviola, which has stopped on the last frame. The opera-~
tor's hand is visible holding the brake.

smile, his eyes full of life and mischief.

INT. AIRLINE TERMINAL - SOUTHWEST - DAY LOA

OPEN CLOSE on a sleeping cowboy. Sonny. His Stetson
pulled down ‘against the harsh fluorescent lights. A
little boy stands nearby, staring at his boots. Sonny's
head rises slowly, he clucks softly as though to a horse.
The boy smiles. LEROY, Sonny's assistant and dresser,
moves INTO SHOT and helps him to his feet, propping him

up.

LEROY
Come on, Champ -- we gotta do
Santa Paula.

We FOLLOW FROM BEHIND, as WENDELL, Sonny's manager abpears
and takes his other side. Wendell is in his fifties,
still hard-bodied with wind-leathered skin and pale

eyes that take in more than they give out.

He checks his watch impatiently. He wears a mustard
colored blazer. A corporate logo featuring a running
horse is emplazoned above his heart. We HEAR the LOUD
VAROOM of cars revving. A final crash and then the
SOUND of a CRIPPLED CAR moving away. APPLAUSE.

' |, arid then when Sonny's daddy,
‘ol Shelton, died, Gus raised
him. Sonny was married right in
Gus's Living room. Ever a man
loved a man... Sonny surely
loves Gus Atwater.’

Hallie examines Sonny's photos. Most are the usual
empty glossies. But one is more candid, off guard...
something vulnerable, trouble shows through. CAMERA
PUSHES to this photo as Wendell's voice continues:

WENDELL'S VOICE
‘and when that woman quit hin,
you know where Sonny came to cool
himself out. Course, Gus is
gettin’ old and strange these days. ‘

HALLIE'S VOICE
‘Why'd she quit him?!

erawls painfully to the horse. He gently examines the
swollen tendon on the horse's back leg. As he touches
it:

ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

Harvey Del Rio for Rudolph Bros.
Lumber and Building Supplies.
Harvey:

HARVEY'S VOICE
(from the radio)

Thanks, Clayton, and good evening
everyone. Retail sales clerks are
still on strike in Salt Lake. Union
officials in the Provo, Orem and
Heber area say their members are
prepared to walk out in sympathy.
In Las Vegas, Investigators still
have no- leads to the whereabouts
of Rising Star, the great
thoroughbred stallion, whose
abduction by Sonny Steele Friday
triggered a massive search. -

Sonny turns UP the VOLUME, listens intently:

HARVEY'S VOICE

(continuing) .
AMPCO officials are now. expressing
alarm over the welfare of the horse.
According to one official, Steele
has a long history of alcoholism and
drug abuse. In the past year he has
appeared before the public in an
intoxicated state on several occasions,
and has been abusive to both press
and public. AMPCO official indicate
he has become increasingly unstable,
often causing public humiliation.
They believe that if the horse is
to survive this ordeal, time is of
the essence.

Sonny snaps the RADIO OFF. He checks his watch. We
HOLD on his set expression as he drives.

approaching a fence too high to jump; he spins the
horse and darts off in another direction. The big |
motoreycles slide on the grass, trying to turn, but
manage to maintain control.

152 A STREET - THE TWO POLICE CARS 152

They've completed half the distance around the block.
and are speeding toward each other when, suddenly,
Rising Star darts between them at a full run. There
is an open field across the street. One of the police
cars bumps up over the curb and goes after them
through the field. The other car races around the
block to try to catch them on the far side.

showers of dirt and debris, most of which ends up in
the eyes of the motorcycle cops. One rider, blinded
by the dirt, turns in the general direction Sonny took
and crashes into the hedge, sending the cop flying.

A SIDE STREET - SONNY AND RISING STAR 158

They fly out from behind a house and plunge into a
street. A woman in a station wagon, thinking it's an
apparition, screams, and swerves to miss him. She
ends up broadside in the street, blocking the oncom-
ing police car. Sonny races off in the opposite direc-
tion so fast that the two motorcycle cops coming
toward him find themselves racing past him. As the
horse races between them, they try to turn, almost
collide, recover and speed off again. People are now
yelling and calling out to Sonny.

Sonny glances back quickly, then concentrates on what
is ahead. A split second before the horse reaches the
edge, Sonny pulls hard on the reins. Rising Star digs
in with all four legs and skids forward. They slide
over the top and down the embankment, the horse re-
maining stiff-legged through the loose shale to the
bottom. The first motorcycle, unable to stop, cata-
pults over the edge and tumbles over and over to the
bottom. The cop, thrown clear, manages to get up,
dirty but unhurt. The police car turns and runs
parallel to Sonny at the top of the embankment,
trailed by the two remaining motorcycles.

ANOTHER ANGLE 172

The valley Sonny is in levels out in front of him. The
hill on his left flattens down to his level. The police
ear, running parallel, is gradually coming down to his
level. Sonny slows the horse slightly, causing the
police car to do the same. At the last minute, Sonny
lets the horse out, and barely edges out the police

car. But from around the hill on Sonny's right, a
second police car flies out. Unable to turn in time,

it hits the first car broadside. The two cars slide

to the left up another embankment. :

Closer to the camp. He stops abruptly, as we HEAR the
distant wail of a police siren.

EXT THE CAMP - HALLIE - JUST ARRIVING 236

She rushes in, relieved that he is not there yet. She
starts to take the purchases out of her bag, hears a
noise, quickly puts the things back into her bag and
turns just in time to see Sonny appear over a rise. He
smiles at her, moves to put the gear onto Rising Star.

A fire burms in the crumbling fireplace. Old rodeo
posters peel off the walls. Sonny is expansive, talk-
ative, Hallie is very subdued.

SONNY

Damn! You know anybody in the
whole world their life's just

You're a... clever lady, you got

She wants desperately to tell him. Can't.

HALLIE
You say it like it's a bad word,
‘clever'. Would you rather I
were dumb?

SONNY
I like you bein' smart. But
sometimes you get so busy bein'
clever that... well, when was
the last time you was surprised?

HALLIE
(quietly)
You. You were a surprise Sonny.

They look at each other. He moves slowly foreward to
kiss her. She turns her face abruptly.

HALLIE
(barely audible):
I told them.

They are both frozen for a moment. Hallie continues guickly

HALLIE
I called the network and told
them where you were going.
{eyes closed)
I told them to meet me there
with a camera crew. They're
probably there now.

Sonny nods imperceptably, waits.

HALLIE
That's... not all.
SONNY

Oh? Now for the bad news, huh?

SONNY

I already slapped you, Alice,

HALLIE
I wouldn't have done it now,
Sonny, I swear...

SONNY
Sure you would. You're a
reporter. A damn good one.
You'd... report.

HALLIE

God, this is ridiculous! You're
the one that broke the law and
I feel like the criminal‘

SONNY
(nodding)
Why d'you think that is?

HALLIE
Because I didn't expect to get
. involved.

SONNY
Involved. Y'mean it's OK to
mess life up for strangers?

HALLIE
I didn't want to mess anything
up. I wanted to get the story.
ALL of it.

You got no right tryin’ to get

HALLIE
Sonny, you're public domain. And
you asked for it. Nobody held a

up there on the box, isn't it? In

It's not your back running away.

SONNY
The horse didn't sign nuthin! And

HALLIE

No. This was supposed to be for

Sonny begins to take the horseshoes off Rising Star.

Well, Star, what d'you think

They must be at another entrance.

We don't go back too far but...

Sonny smiles, takes Star's reins.

SONNY
Excuse us a minute. 1

He walks the horse a distance away. Takes the bit out
of his mouth.

SONNY
Remember, they're just horses,
same as you, only they never
been broke. But they never won
no championships neither. So
when you cross that stallion and
he wants to fight, remember you
got the blood on your side.

HALLIE

Will he go - just like that?

SONNY
You bet.

HALLIE
But I thought you guys were pals.

A waitress arrives with a jelly donut with a tiny candle
stuck in it. Hallie is very touched.

Nothing further is known.

She begins to collect her papers.

And the unusual man who sect him

Except for a minor postscript.

The co-anchor man looks over abruptly. The camera man
covering her checks the clock and is puzzled.

HALLIE
Mr. Steele will be happy to hear
that his name is not as well known
as it was - even a week ago. Signs
