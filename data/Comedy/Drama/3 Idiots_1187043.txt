India produces about 800 films every year but not even eight get documented.
There is no reading material available for film students or film lovers on the behind-
the-scenes action, the vision of the filmmakers, and the processes involved in making
a film. Lage Raho Munnabhai: The Original Screenplay was published last year.
3 Idiots: The Original Screenplay is our second attempt in this direction. This book
is not just the screenplay; it is also a peek into the minds of its makers.

I would like to thank Smriti Kiran who took the initiative to come up with this
book within 5 months of the release of the film. She has spent many long days
and long nights chasing the cast and crew, writing and rewriting, with a smile on
her face. Without her persistence, this book would not have happened.

I would also like to thank Ajay Mago and his team at Om Books International for
giving shape to our vision.

Talso wish to thank Maheep Dhillon for tirelessly redrafting the screenplay; Supriya
Kelkar for her eye for detail; Rohan Mapuskar for poring over the dialogues;
Dileep Desai, Amit Gulati, Mustafa Neemuchwala, Teja Pratap, Insia Lacewalla for
production support; Anupama Chopra for her invaluable insight.

And Vinod Chopra for clearing all obstacles as always.

Every story has a back story and so does mine.

My father, Suresh Hirani, was fourteen years old when he along with the family
moved to India during Partition. Initially, they took shelter in refugee camps in
Agra and later shifted to Ferozabad. He had lost everything so education was low
on the priority list. There were more pressing and immediate concerns like food,
clothes, and shelter to worry about. To make ends meet, my father started working
in a bangle factory where he painted patterns on bangles. Later, he began selling
ice-cream on the streets. Despite compelling and adverse circumstances, his thirst
for knowledge did not wane.

My father’s sister, who was married in Nagpur, got him a job there in a general
store as a store attendant. The city brought with it opportunity. My father enrolled
himself in night school. Work in the day and classes at night continued and he
somehow managed to graduate. Fortified with a degree and some savings, he was
itching to grow. So when a friend suggested that typewriters, which were new at
the time, were the future, my father decided to explore this avenue. He invested
his life’s savings, borrowed the rest of the money needed and opened a typewriting
institute which was referred to as a ‘Commerce Institute’ then. My father christened
it ‘Rajkumar Commerce Institute’. I was not even born then. So now you know
that I was named after a typewriting institute and not the other way round! Most
parents would name their enterprises after their children, but I’ve had the rare
honour of being named after my father’s enterprise. I’m proud of that fact.

My father’s business flourished. He got married and I was born soon after. The
plan was to get into engineering but I didn’t have enough marks in my higher
secondary exams (12th standard) to make the cut so I studied commerce. I had
also enrolled in this foundation course for chartered accountancy simultaneously,
the classes for which were held in the evenings. At the end of the foundation

03_Introduction.indd 11 6/31/2010 1:47:17 AM
course, the exams for chartered accountancy were to be held. I despised these
classes from the very beginning. I had no interest in chartered accountancy and
these classes were a huge imposition, both in terms of time and the fact that I was
wasting this time on something I knew was not for me. But I had the baggage of
the engineering debacle on my head so abandoning this very viable option would
have appeared self-indulgent, foolish, and luxurious at the time. I was afraid I

would hurt my parents and also somewhat scared to take this step that could harm
my ‘future’. I carried on with the charade.

Subconsciously, I was aware that there were some set presumptions about my future.
I was expected to either become a chartered accountant or take over my father’s
business. Both possibilities mortified me. Though at that point in time, I was not
thinking about what would make me happy. Like any normal person, I had
responsibilities and the usual concerns that range from job to future to career. As

12

03_Introduction.indd 12 6/31/2010 1:47:17 AM
the time for the foundation course’s exams drew close, I would often wake up in
the middle of the night in cold sweat.

Finally, the exams were upon me. I realised that there was no escaping the inevitable.
It was imperative to tell my father that I found a root canal procedure more exciting
than chartered accountancy. Even after twenty years, that evening is as clear in my
head as if it had happened just yesterday.

Tt was a regular evening in Nagpur but for me it was going to be the most significant
and decisive evening of my life. My father was standing alone in the living room.
I walked in and walked up to where he was standing, taking lead-laden steps. My
throat was dry with uncertainty and fear. It was one thing to tell your father that
you did not want to pursue what seemed like an excellent career choice but it was
another thing to not offer an alternative plan. The only thing I was clear about
was that chartered accountancy was not my cup of tea. My voice quivered with
apprehension as I told him that I did not want to take the exams because I did
not enjoy chartered accountancy at all. He looked at me and then in the most
nonchalant manner told me to not do it and join his office starting next morning.
It was as short and simple as that. I was ecstatic. The weight of the world had lifted
from my shoulders. I felt free. This happened during the period leading up to the
festival Makar Sankranti which is known for kite flying. I remember running up
to our terrace right after ‘the conversation’ and flying kites with this silly grin on
my face. Now, the kite flying seems almost like a symbol for the sense of freedom
and relief that had swept over me that day.

My commerce classes in college occupied only four hours of my time in the
morning (7 am to 11.00 am), so the rest of my time was devoted to helping my
father with his business (11.30 am to 6.30 pm) which had graduated from typing
courses to repairing and selling new kinds of calculators and other office equipment.
I immersed myself in it with the gusto of a man who had just been extracted from
the gallows. I used to teach typing, go out and give demos to prospective clients,
and repair spoiled units. I was even sent to Delhi to do a course in repairing
electronic calculators.

This is the period where I had my first brush with theatre. I met Narendra Thakur
and a few other students who used to perform and produce plays regularly at our
college. I joined them. (Before this, my only experience on stage was in the 9th
standard. I was cast in the role of ‘Noorjahan’ in a play.) I became a regular with
the theatre gang. Abandoning the foundation course opened up my evenings to

13

03_Introductionindd 13, 6/31/2010 1:47:22 AM
be occupied, and occupied they were with writing, reading, and brainstorming
about plays. This stirred something within me. I have always believed that there
are two approaches to learning: one is to study something academically and the
other is to get interested in something and then start to gather material on it and
learn about it. The latter is always a more gratifying experience. I would hunt for
Hindi plays in quaint bookshops. I would devour anything on theatre. We would
participate in competitions, youth festivals, and travel to any place that even
hinted at an opportunity for exposure in the field. Youth festivals were a platform
where teams from all the colleges in Nagpur came and performed. At one such
festival, I met another theatre group which was performing for the Nagpur Medical
College. There were a few people in that group, especially Debashish Naha, who
were passionate about theatre and took this enterprise very seriously. There was
an instant connection with Debashish and soon our friendship led to my theatre
group merging with his to form a new theatre group called Awaaz. Debashish and
I would spend hours working on plays. He would get me plays written in Bangla

14

03_Introductionindd 14 6/31/2010 1:47:22 AM
and we would sit down and translate them in Hindi. We started putting up plays
under our banner. Personalities such as Marathi theatre-director Kishore Kulkarni,
who had received acclaim on stage were invited to direct plays for our group. We
learnt under many such people who had a command over their craft and a natural
flair for the medium. Since everyone was busy till 6 pm everyday, we used to meet
after that. These meetings were held either at the Bengali Association Hall or at the
Sindhi Gurudwara nearby which had a hall, or at the local school hall. Wherever
we found some empty space, we parked ourselves. The rehearsals used to go on

till midnight.

We pursued this with such passion that theatre soon became an obsession. We
managed to put up a record three to four plays a year. These plays were not restricted
to performing at colleges. We started putting up ticketed shows. Apart from the
creative aspect, the entire production of the play was handled by us. We organised
everything from booking the hall, putting up the sets, props, costumes, accounts,
and even ticketing. Watching plays was not the preferred pastime in Nagpur, so we
used to sell the tickets to friends and relatives. Accounts were maintained diligently.
In fact, I still have some of the accounts from those days. We used to barely cover
our production costs and that is all we wanted. We were not doing this for profit.
We just wanted to be able to put up plays and hoped to cover costs and use the
money to put up the next one. On those rare occasions, if anything was earned over
and above the production cost, it ensured a grand meal for our entire group.

It was not difficult to speak to my father the second time. Intuitive and observant,
he was not blind to my growing passion for theatre. The suggestion to tread this
path in earnest came from my father. He told me to enrol in a program to get
formal education (my father is a great believer in learning) in the field of writing,
directing, and storytelling. The natural choice was to apply to the Film and Television
Institute of India (FTI).

My first attempt (1983) to get into FTII in the direction course was unsuccessful. I
had very little knowledge of the exam and the enrolment procedures. I had travelled
to Mumbai to take the exam. There I learnt that the entrance exam for FTII was
exactly like bank exams, and anyone studying for it would clear it without blinking. I
also realised that seats for the direction course were few and almost everyone applied
for this course. I came back to Nagpur and enrolled myself in the Faculty of Law as
that seemed like a reasonable option if things did not work out. Alongside, I started
preparing for the FTII exam. The next year (1984), I applied again to FTII but

15

this time for the editing and not the direction course. I got admission. The day I
received the telegram, informing me about my admission to FTII, was the happiest
day of my life. I was delirious with joy. I thought I had arrived and my life was
made. This thought stemmed from naiveté. Sitting in Nagpur, I had only heard of
the ten to fifteen names of really successful people who had graduated from FTII
so I assumed that getting admission meant I was set up for life. I looked at my
admission in the Institute as one looks at getting into law school or engineering.
Once you get in and work hard, the moment you graduate, you become a director.
All these illusions were shattered two days into my time at FTII. My enthusiasm
was replaced by an inferiority complex. I was from a small town in the midst of
students waxing eloquent about theories, films, and ideas that were Greek and
Latin to me. It took me time but I found my feet again and got my voice back.
It taught me a very important lesson: you cannot lose yourself just by perceiving
yourself to know less. If stereotypes have to be broken, then first they have to be
broken within you.

16

03_Introduction.indd 16 5/31/2010 1:47:30 AM
Thus, began the journey of disillusionment and enlightenment, unlearning and
learning, passion, failure, and fulfillment. After three years at FTII, I moved to
Mumbai (1987) and stayed with my friend and batchmate Sriram Raghavan
(filmmaker). My first job was as an editor on an advertisement directed by Bharat
Rangachari. After this, I was recommended by late editor Renu Saluja and I edited
a documentary. I was paid Rs 1500 for my first job and Rs 500 for the second one.
But things were slow to come by. After sometime, the situation became precarious.
Video had just exploded on the scene so we were hard pressed for assignments as
we did not know how to edit on video. I could not even turn to my father for
help because he was going through a financial slump. His business of typewriters
had taken a beating because of the arrival of computers. So both my father and I
were facing what you can term a ‘technological gap’.

The first year in Mumbai (1987), after passing out from the Institute, was a difficult
one. I came very close to giving up during that year. There were many dark nights
of the soul. I thought about going back to Nagpur. Maybe do something related
to cinema there. It was a matter of survival, and the strangest options came to my
mind. I entertained the idea of shooting marriage videos creatively and putting a
completely unique spin to them. Maybe do multiple camera set-ups and scale things
up considerably. Exports, which was a much talked about thing back then, was the
other option that came to mind. I went to Fort in Mumbai (there are many street
vendors of second-hand books in Fort) and picked up a book on exports. I was
desperately groping in the dark trying to hold on to something. Fortunately, FTII
revived its one-month video course that was promised to us. We rushed back to
the Institute for the course. After one month, we returned to Mumbai with the
knowledge of what would be our survival kit in the city: video editing.

I joined an editing studio called Ekta Studio (1988) as an in-house editor on a
monthly salary of Rs 1000. My six-month stint here gave me enough contacts and
clout in the market to get regular work. I told myself, rather theatrically, that it
mattered not if I didn’t make a lot of money: this life I have devoted to cinema. I
convinced myself with something as dramatic as that. Once you accept this, then
the dark nights disappear and all nights convert to being nights of battle: the battle
to become better, to excel, to strive towards quality.

During this phase of finding my feet in the business, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, my peer
from FTII, who was assisting Vinod, called me to edit the promos of 1942: A Love
Story (1992). But things did not go beyond that just yet. Meanwhile, from editing I

17

03_Introduction.indd 17 5/31/2010 1:47:34 AM
had moved up to directing advertising films and opened my own production house
called Canvas Films (1991).

In 1998, I was called in to edit the promos of Kareeb as well because Vinod had liked
my work on 1942: A Love Story. This was again a one-off stint. I continued doing
work in advertising. Canvas Films flourished and I became financially secure.

I had settled into a comfortable pattern till the morning I received a call from
Vinod (2000). He wanted me to edit Mission Kashmir. Not just the promos but the
entire film. Initially, I was reluctant as I did not want to leave a lucrative set-up.
But once I learnt of Renu’s condition (Renu, Vinod’s first wife and film editor, was
suffering from cancer and her condition was going from bad to worse with each
passing day), I could not say no. It was during the making of Mission Kashmir that
my latent desire to direct a feature film resurfaced. Watching cinema being made
with such passion and commitment by Vinod and his team rekindled the spirit in
me that I had in my theatre days.

18

03_Introductionindd 18 5/31/2010 1:47:34 AM
I knew I was ready to make a film. And I began working on writing my first film.
How Munna Bhai came about is another long story but that I will keep for the
book on Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.

So why did I just spill my guts and share my life with you?

Simply because so much of 3 /diots is personal. 1 am a small town man from
Nagpur with no connections or background in films. I started working towards
something that made me happy and that is all there is to it. I worked with passion
and honesty, and even if success had not come my way, I would still have been
really happy as I got to chase my dreams.

It has been a long and wonderful ride, but the key here is, it has been a ride of my
choice. The desire to make 3 Idiots stemmed from this thought. I am not trying
to say that engineering or chartered accountancy or any other profession for that
matter is any less than wildlife photography or filmmaking, and so on. My belief is
simple. Choose your own path. Choose without fear. It is not a foolproof formula
for happiness or success but it is definitely one that is most likely to work.

Farhan looks out of the window and

reminisces.

Where did he go ... lets find him

We were led by the path we took
While he carved a path of his own
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he

We fretted about the morrow
He simply revelled in today
Living each moment to the fullest

Where did he come from ...
He who touched our hearts and vanished ...
Where did he go ... lets find him

In scorching Sun, he was like a patch of
shade ...

In an endless desert, like an oasis ...

On a bruised heart, like soothing balm
was he

Afraid, we stayed confined in the well
Fearless, he frolicked in the river
Never hesitating to swim

against the tide

He wandered lonesome as a cloud
. Yet he was our dearest friend
Where did he go ... lets find him

shoots up first, all the students raise their

CHATUR

Sir, machines are any combination of bodies
so connected that their relative motions
are constrained and by which means,
force and motion may be transmitted
and modified as a screw and its nut, or
a lever arranged to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc., especially,
a construction, more or less complex
consisting of a combination of moving
parts, or simple mechanical elements, as

wheels, levers, cams, etc.

Professor Potdar looks at Chatur with

his forehead in agony, then turns around
and drops the helicopter into a dustbin. He
walks away. From behind a pillar, Rancho
gazes after him compassionately. He walks
up to the dustbin, retrieves the helicopter
and looks at it wonderingly.

Hugging his son’ coffin, crying inconsolably,
is Joys father.

PRIEST

‘We commend our brother Joy to the Lord.
May the Lord receive him into his peace
and raise up his body on the final day.

Farhan and Raju stand together, grief etched
on their faces. Rancho stands by himself,
oblivious to the rain soaking him, his tears
mingling with the raindrops.

PRIEST

Let us pray for our brother Joy to our lord
Jesus Christ who said “I’m the resurrection
and the life. The man who believes in me
will live even if he dies. And every living
person who puts his faith in me will never

suffer eternal death ...”.

Rancho makes a futile attempt to wipe
his eyes, and looks up. He spots the
Director on the fringe of the group of
mourners. His eyes suddenly fierce, he

walks up to him.

How dare you blame me for Joy’s suicide?
If one student can’t handle pressure, is it
our fault? Life is full of pressures. Will you
always blame others for pressure in life?

RANCHO

I don't blame you, Sir. I blame the system.
Look at these statistics — India ranks No.1
in suicides. Every 90 minutes, a student
attempts suicide. Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease. Something's terribly wrong,
Sir.

discuss new ideas or inventions. They
discuss grades, jobs, settling in USA. They
teach how to get good scores. They don’t
teach engineering.

Come in. See that? We could afford just
one air-conditioner We put it in Farhan’s

buy a car. I managed with a scooter. We

Raju’s house was straight out of a’50s black

paralysed father, a coughing mother and
an unwed sister. A sofa sprouting springs
and a 24-hour water supply from the
leaking roof. His mother was a retired

His father was once a postmaster. Paralysis
shut down his body partly — and his salary
completely. And the sister ...

We'll study with all our heart, but not
just for grades. To quote a Wise One —
“Study to be accomplished, not affluent.
Follow excellence. And success will chase

you, pants down!”

Guru Ranchhoddas?

Raju got onto another train. His travails

FARHAN
Chatur was called ‘Silencer’. To sharpen
his memory, he popped pills from a local
quack. And then let off silent ... but
lethal farts.

CHATUR
I didn’t do it ... Raju?

FARHAN
He always blamed others for the output.

Farhan rushes through the open doors of

He sees a body laid on the ground, in

What happened?
A huge portrait of a ferocious-looking
MAN is displayed in the room. The name
under the frame says - SHAMALDAS
CHANCHAD. Farhan addresses someone
who looks like an ATTENDANT in the
household.

The Attendant points to a MAN sitting
with his back to them, in conversation with
someone who looks like a POLITICIAN.

 

With suppressed excitement, Farhan,
Raju and Chatur walk slowly towards the
seated Man. Reaching him, Farhan taps
his shoulder.

The Man turns around ...

But it is not Rancho.

They clasp hands. The Politician leaves
with his entourage. The Man starts walking
away too, directing a dirty look at Farhan,
Raju and Chatur.

Unable to comprehend what is happening,
Farhan looks around, baffled. Something
on the wall catches his eye. It’s a framed
ICE degree.

Farhan goes closer to the wall. In mounting
shock, he reads out the name on the
degree.

His gaze travels downward, to the framed

Without taking his eyes off the photograph,
he beckons Raju.

Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
engineering is my girlfriend and wife

both. But I still fail. Why?

FARHAN
Explain,

RANCHO

’Cause you're a coward. Scared of the
future. Look at this, more holy rings
than fingers. One ring per fear: exam,
sister’s dowry and job. With such fear of
tomorrow, how will you live today? How
will you focus on studies?

shows in his eyes.

At Raju’s bedside, Rancho rants at his
comatose friend for making his Mother

cry.

Next to Raju’s monitor are pictures of his
Mother and Father and his sister, Kammo.
Rancho randomly picks up Kammo’s
picture and thrusts it into Raju’s face
while chastising him. Raju’s monitor beeps
loudly, the graphic lines on it changing
rapidly.

Rancho stops short, looking from the
monitor to the picture. A desperate idea
takes hold in his mind.

Overwhelmed with emotion, they hug

Farhan captures all these moments on

students, with the exception of Chatur,
give him a standing ovation. Among those
applauding, their eyes brimming with pride,
are Raju, Pia and Millimeter.

On stage, the Director hands Rancho his
degree with aplomb. Farhan, the only

student not in a graduation robe, has his
camera ready.

FARHAN

Sir, one photo, Sir!

The Director grabs Rancho’s hand and
drags him forward in a mock imitation
of dragging him through the college
corridors.

He stops, puts his arm around Rancho
and smiles warmly.

Farhan clicks.

The new graduates throw up their hats
in celebration.

Farhan walks in the crowd, capturing
moments on his camera; the Director

laughing with his students, a grimacing
Chatur being kissed on his cheek by his
Mother, Raju and his Mother embracing
while weeping tears of joy.

In the midst of all this, unnoticed by
anyone, his degree in his hand, Rancho
loads his luggage into a taxi.

Rancho looks around once, tears in his

looking through his viewfinder, sees this.
He lowers his camera, puzzled, and watches
as the taxi drives away.

EXT. LADAKH ROADS — DAY

Chatur’s SUV travels through the stark,
stunning landscape of Ladakh.

Inside the SUV, Chatur, still gagged and
bound, now sits on the backseat. He is
flanked by Pia and Raju. Pia has her eyes
closed and hands folded in prayer.

Farhan drives.

The SUV turns in the direction of a road
sign reading ‘Skitsal School’.

Chatur makes angry noises through his
Sag.

Farhan glances at him through his rear-

view mirror.

A model plane circles over the shimmering
turquoise of a lake. On a narrow strip of
sand jutting into the lake, stands the group
controlling the plane — Rancho and several
laughing, clamouring children.

Rancho manoeuvres the plane with a remote
control, childish glee and enthusiasm on
his face. He turns from the lake and stops
short. Riding towards him, on the old,
flour-making scooter from his school, is Pia.
Without taking his eyes off Pia, Rancho

His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas had

THE MVIETHOD IN THE IVIADNESS

Rajkumar Hirani, Abhijat Joshi, & Vidhu Vinod Chopra Recollect
In the course of putting this book together, the many conversations I had with Rajkumar
Hirani revealed that in a life spanning over four decades filled with many challenging
and debilitating experiences, the one that is clearly etched in his memory as the
most oppressive of them all is the month preceding his 12th standard exams. “Every
night I would get a recurring dream that I was taking an exam and I did not know
the answer to even a single question. I would wake up in cold sweat,” he said. Raju
attributes this to the fear psychosis created around exams and grades in India. The
first few daunting months at FTII, a year without work and money in Mumbai,
myriad struggles to set up a career, the Herculean task of making movies were lesser
strains compared to the pressures of Higher Secondary exams in his life.

It was no surprise then that when he started hunting for a subject he felt deeply
about as the DNA for his first feature film, he decided on the story of three friends
in a medical college. The aim was to weave a tale that enthralled with anecdotes
from life in a hostel and make a comment both on the education system and the
medical practice in India. For Raju, life in a hostel signified freedom. The time he
spent doing theatre with his group Awaaz with the students from Nagpur Medical
College, hostel life at FTI, and the horrors of education engineered towards grades
were experiences that had left an indelible impression on him. Therefore, the first
draft of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. had, instead of the lovable Bhai and his sidekick
Circuit, three friends living in a medical college. The script and the ideas kept
changing and evolving. At the end, the three friends had to wait and give way to
the duo that became the Indian equivalent of Batman and Robin: the incorrigible
and immensely endearing Munna and Circuit.

But the initial idea that he started with lay latent in Raju’s subconscious for the
next six years. Such must have been his desire to make this film one day and
so great the need for the world to have this idea translated on screen that the
universe conspired to make it happen. Vidya Balan and the Mumbai deluge of
2005 played significant roles in pulling this blueprint out from the deep recesses
of Raju’s mind. It was May 2005 and Vidya had just finished shooting for the
first schedule of Lage Raho Munna Bhai. She and Raju had struck up an instant
rapport often recommending interesting films and books to each other. Vidya
happened to read Five Point Someone during this period. She knew Chetan so she
was aware that he was keen to get the book across to Raju as possible material
for a film. Vidya immediately lent her copy of the book to Raju saying that this
was an idea she felt had legs. But being in the middle of making a film, Raju
did not have time to breathe let alone read. The book gathered dust on his
bookshelf for sometime. And then in July, Mumbai faced the worst rain-induced
floods ever. Life for everyone in Mumbai came to a standstill. Raju’s lane was
completely flooded and he had no choice but to stay home for a couple of days.
That is when he picked up Five Point Someone and read it. The story of three
friends and their experiences in an engineering college took him by surprise and
brought to the fore his first draft of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. He discussed it with
Vinod and Abhijat. The rights to adapt the book into a film were bought and
the rest as they say is history.

The one-liner (a scene-wise synopsis of the screenplay and its trajectory) of 3 Idiots
was ready in a record nine days and the first draft of the screenplay with dialogues was
ready in 18 days from the day Abhijat Joshi, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, and Rajkumar
Hirani started working on it (2006). After that, it took the three writers, two-and-
a-half years to arrive at a shooting script.

The evolution of the screenplay involved ponderous work on innumerable drafts,
multiple scenarios (some retained and many abandoned), copious amounts of green
tea, long walks, and several trips around the globe.

The journey was through a labyrinth of possibilities. [In some drafts Pia was Farhan’s
ex-girlfriend; Chatur and not Suhas was to marry Pia; Farhan was an unhappy
corporate honcho in New York; instead of wildlife photography, linguistics was
Farhan’s passion; Joy and Phunsukh Wangdu were added and deleted frequently.]
The key to the screenplay was to find the best way forward that enabled the narrative
to be consistently compelling, real, and entertaining.

These interviews with the writers were recorded between January and April 2010,
at various locations, in Mumbai.

322
There is a method to the three of you working together. How does it work?

VC: We have been working together for many years and have immense mutual
respect and affection for each other. Abhijat and I go back to the Kareeb days
and with Raju my writing association started with Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. 1 don't
sit with them and write continuously. My biggest contribution and challenge is
to channelise their passion and energies in a direction. I am their rubbish radar.
They do the writing and come to me constantly with material at regular intervals.
I either change some things or add new things to it or reject it. My work here is
of a good reviewer.

RH: Abhijat and I write constantly while working on the screenplay and once we
have a ready draft, we start the sessions with Vinod. He is brilliant at catching
the problems, the chinks in the script, the flaws. It is fantastic to get this kind of
perspective on one’s work as one is going along. It keeps us on the right track.

AJ: The interesting thing about the three of us working together is the diversity
in our methods of working which eventually enhances the material we work on.
Vinod’s method of writing and Raju’s and my methods are completely different but
our goal is the same: a great story.

Raju and I operate by working on individual scenes and later binding them
together which brings the desired unpredictability to our work whereas Vinod
likes his character arcs and plot defined. Therefore, when we take the scenes to
Vinod, he lends the necessary prespective to them. The principle which has been
the guiding metaphor throughout Aristotle's writings has been that the action of a
narrative or drama must be presented as “a complete whole, with its several incidents
so closely connected that the transposal [shifting an incident/scene from one point in
the narrative to another] or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate
the whole.” This is the principle that Vinod follows. His focus is the whole. Every
scene in the film must carry the story forward. It must have a purpose that serves
this movement. You cannot narrate a scene to Vinod and tell him that the purpose
of the scene is to make people laugh or cry. He will immediately throw it out.
Scenes might be luminous on their own but they are useless if they do not light
up the whole narrative is Vinod’s belief. Raju and I often get carried away by the
individual scenes. In the second half of 3 diots, Vinod took out a few dramatic
scenes which in hindsight I feel would have weakened our film. He believes that
we cannot overload the audience because after a while, they stop caring. There is
Fatigue that sets in. You need to have that balance where you don’t give in to the

323
temptation of overdoing things. To give you an example, the speech scene was
kept not because it was funny but because it had a purpose beyond making the
audience laugh. The speech demonstrated the pitfalls of rote learning and brought
the conflicting philosophies in the film, of chasing excellence and blindly chasing
success, out in the open.

This is the way in which we work together. Different perspectives enable us to
retain quality without losing focus.

The germ of the idea came from Chetan Bhagat’s book Five Point Someone.
What is it that drew you to the book?

RH: I loved the description of hostel life in the book. It instantly held my attention.
I had lived in a the hostel, like the boys in the book, so it was very appealing to
me. Education and the pressures one faces with regard to education that would result
in a ‘better life’, the one defined by society and not necessarily by the individual,
have always been of great interest to me. This gave me a wonderful opportunity to
combine these thoughts with a few anecdotes from the book.

It took over two-and-a-half years for the screenplay to come together. What
were the challenges that you faced while writing it?

RH: Five Point Someone, though immensely enjoyable, was very anecdotal in its
treatment. I knew the moment I read the book that we would have to spend
considerable time adapting it into a screenplay. There is nothing in the book that
binds it together. For a film, a binding thread is critical. The audience has to be
taken on a journey through the characters and plot. It has to move towards something
to hold the attention of the viewers. For example, in Lagaan, one of the things
that keeps you hooked till the end is the cricket match. The whole film is moving
towards that. I could not find this thread within the book and from there stemmed
the desire to create an external story. The idea for the external story came to me in
Kenya. The Kenyan Film Board had invited a select group of Indian film directors
and cinematographers to explore Kenya as a shooting destination for Indian films.
Therefore, Nikhil Advani, Shaad Ali, and I, including a few other directors and
cinematographers, travelled to Kenya. Initially, as usual, I was very reluctant to go.
What happens with me is that whenever I am invited to some place and if I am
working, I start thinking that it is a waste of time, and, therefore, why should I go.
This is the reason I decline most of the times and then I regret it. Twice over I passed

324
up the opportunity to go to Australia thinking that I am working on my script and
it would be a waste of time. In both cases, I could have easily gone and come back
and my life would not have changed. So when this invitation came, sometime in
March 2007, I decided I must go. I went but out of habit carried my laptop with
me hoping I would find time to get some work done there. On reaching Kenya,
I discovered that they had a packed itinerary planned for us for each day of our
stay. Obviously, they wanted to show us the maximum number of locations. The day
used to start at 6 am and end at 9 pm. After two days of intense sightseeing, I got
anxious about my script. I started getting very edgy. On the third day, I refused to
go. Nikhil and everyone else started laughing at me. I realised that if I told them
the truth, then I would not be able to escape so I lied and told them that I was
not well. They left without me. I took out my laptop and started working on my
script. Funnily, one lady who was with the film board, landed up in my room with
a doctor. I sheepishly told them that now I was better. Hopefully, when she reads
this she shall realise how pivotal this day of work in Kenya was to 3 Idiots.

That entire day, the one day I managed to work on my script, away from all phone
calls and distractions, I sat in my hotel room thinking about the story that I need
to introduce to bind the film. That is when this thought about the bet between the
rivals struck me. One friend goes away and then the other two search for him. For
the audience, the binding factor would then be — do they find this friend or not?
If they do find him, then what is the story of the friend? Why did he leave? Where
did he go? Does he win the bet or does he lose? At every stage, these questions
would be at the back of their minds. This desire and curiosity in the audience to
get to the end of the film is the backbone of a screenplay. If I were to remove
this entire story from the screenplay, then the film becomes just a story set in a
college and you are not really looking forward to anything. I remember I called
Abhijat from there and told him this idea and he loved it. The icing on the cake
was Abhijat coming up with the imposter idea.

AJ: The imposter idea in the film came from a real-life story. I knew a man
(I cannot name him as he is someone from the industry) who actually did what
the real Ranchoddas does in the film. A man applies to FTII and gets through. He
also applies to an engineering college and gets selected. He gets selected in many
places. He is a brilliant guy. Of all the entrance exams he clears, he decides to enrol
in the engineering college. This brilliant guy is our imposter’s friend. The imposter
wants to study cinema so he takes his friend’s permission and impersonates him. He
studies at FTII for three years posing as the brilliant guy who chose engineering.

325
The imposter passes out of the Institute, joins the film industry, changes back to
his real identity and makes films. This real-life story, which not too many people
know about, inspired the whole Rancho-imposter track.

RH: We combined the search and the imposter tracks and got the story of the
film. The binding thread which was missing to keep the narrative moving was now
in place. This was probably one of the most critical of the challenges we faced in
writing 3 Idiots.

‘What according to you is the core of 3 Idiots?

AJ: The first scene that we wrote for 3 Idiots was the conversation between Boman
and Aamir at Joy’s funeral. This scene was in a different form and shape the first
time we wrote it. On the night of the suicide, Rancho goes up to the tower in
the campus, rings the bell, gathers the students and delivers a speech. But in this
form, the scene became too dramatic, grim, and preachy. We worked for days to
make it more real and yet retain the drama and impact. The scene you see in the
film felt more natural so we changed the speech to a conversation at the funeral.
We purposely chose to make the boy who commits suicide a Christian so that the
funeral is set in a cemetery. The grey of the cemetery and the rain gave the scene
the grim and colourless tone that we needed. This scene, according to me, is the
core of 3 Idiots. Why should people be killing themselves? There is something wrong
with the system. Why is everyone running after grades and not knowledge? That
is what the film addresses and attacks.

VC: I agree with Abhijat. 3 /diots questions the system and its pitfalls. The pressure
to chase grades leads students to give in to pursuits that might not be the ones of
their choice and compels them to take the set and decided path to set and decided
goals. This only leads to suicides or mediocrity. Chasing excellence is not encouraged.
Excellence over success is a philosophy I have always followed which has led me to
take some very irrational decisions that have made no business sense. But because
the pursuit was for quality, in the long run, success came in leaps and bounds.

It is a very personal film. Not only does it embody a philosophy that is close
to your heart but it heavily borrows from your lives as well. Which portions
in the film have been picked from your lives?

RH: There is a lot in the film from the scenes to the quirks added to embellish
characters to dialogues that we have taken from our lives. I used to know a guy

326
called Prasan Jain in FTII who once had a bath at the entrance gate of the campus
to make the faculty aware that there was an acute water shortage in the hostel. So
Rancho bathing in the garden came from there. “Jahanpanah tussi great ho” is also
borrowed from the Film Institute. We were ragged for an entire month after we
joined. All throughout that month, if we spotted a senior, we had to pull down our
pants, bend over, pat our butts, and say, “Jahanpanah tussi great ho. Tohfa kubool karo.”
This practice was called Farshi. In my days at the Nagpur Medical College with my
theatre buddies, I got to know about this guy who used to slip magazines under
the doors of other students to distract them during exams. The competition there
was so fierce that people resorted to some really desperate things. The conversation
between Farhan and his father is again inspired by the conversation I had with my
father which I have mentioned in detail in the introduction to this book.

AJ: I have already told you about the impostor story. Apart from the search for the
third friend and the imposter track, the third primary element in the story is the
bet between Chatur and Rancho. This bet signifies the clash of rival ideologies. We
got the idea for this from an anecdote from Vinod’s initial years in the industry. After
the trial of one of the films made by a big Bollywood producer, Vinod hitched a
ride with him in his posh car to be dropped to the nearest bus stop. The producer
asked Vinod what he thought about the film. Vinod launched into shredding the
screenplay bit by bit and let the man know without mincing words that the film
was utter rubbish. The gentleman turned around and said, “Jadd vaddi gaadi lenga
na tadd dekhanga tu kaisi picture banayenga” (When you get used to riding in a big
car, then we will see the kind of films you make). The producer’s point was simple:
when you get used to the luxuries, it is what works at the box office that takes
precedence over the quality of cinema. Vinod got out of the car and swore that this
is something he would never adhere to. He was clear from the beginning that the
ball game was cinema and not money. If you got the former right, then the latter
would follow. This clash of philosophies, of thought, money versus good cinema
was the trigger for the bet between Rancho and Chatur. The Rancho “definition
of books and the machine” scene is my gift to Raju’s son Veer. Raju was helping
Veer with his homework. One of the questions in the assignment was: Why do we
celebrate Good Friday? Veer’s answer to that was “to commemorate the resurrection
of Christ.” Raju wanted to know if Veer knew the meaning of this answer. To his
surprise, Veer did not. Raju launched into explaining it to him and then asked Veer
to write the answer the way he had understood it. But Veer was adamant that it
had to be written only in the manner that he had written it or his teacher would

327
not be happy. Easy or uncomplicated language and, most importantly, veering away
from the expected and accepted form of the answer was not an option. Raju was
very baffled and concerned about this. He told me this story over the phone and
it became the genesis of the Rancho-Professor ‘definition-of-machine’ face-off.

The scene where Rancho, Farhan, and Raju go to Farhan’s house after the Director
sends the warning letter to both Raju and Farhan’s parents is also inspired from
two different incidents that happened in my life and Raju’s. Once, I had met a
lady who was furious with her daughter. The daughter was a bright girl but the lady
was yelling at her because she had scored 91 per cent instead of 94 per cent. The
3 per cent drop was unacceptable. The insanity of this mad race for marks left me
amused and disturbed at the same time. When we were writing this scene, I really
wanted to incorporate this. While at FTII, Raju with his Institute friends used to
travel to Mumbai often over the weekends. On one such weekend, a friend of his
invited them to his house for dinner. They all landed up at his place eager to devour
the free food so looked forward to in those money-strapped college days. The friend
who invited them and his mother had had a big fight. They sat in silence waiting
for the announcement that the food is ready. After two hours, the mother got up
and told the boys, “Beta agli baar aaoge to khaana zaroor kha kar jaana.” Raju still
remembers this because it was close to midnight when they were asked to leave and
they were famished with barely over twenty rupees between all of them.

The watch track between Pia and Rancho again came from an anecdote that Vinod
had told me about ...

VC: See I told you I cannot remember half the things. Abhijat has been gifted with
a photographic memory. A relative of mine was working in the Gulf and was very
well off. I was not doing that well then. During one of his visits, he was flaunting
his watch which cost a couple of lakhs. I heard him out and then exclaimed that
there must be something wrong with his watch. He was taken aback and frantically
examined his expensive watch. There was nothing wrong with it according to him
so he asked me to explain myself. ‘Aapki ghadi itni mehngi hai aur meri sirf do sau
rupyaye ki lekin phir bhi time same dikhateen hein” (your watch is very expensive
and mine costs only Rs 200 but both of them tell the same time), was my reply
which left him speechless.

Rancho propels the story forward. He illustrates the philosophy of the film. A
lot of people felt that his character does not have an arc in the film. Rancho

328
enters the story, preaches, and then leaves. He is too perfect. How did Rancho as
a character evolve and did you have any fears and apprehensions that he might
appear to be more fiction than real as he began to take shape?

RH: The backbone of Rancho’s character which also separates him from everybody
else is his lack of fear. He is a brilliant, free-spirited, and honest boy who is
chasing what he is interested in most. Probably a person without fear has become
unfathomable today so Rancho might seem unreal to some but to me he is very
real. My first thoughts on Rancho were that he is a boy from a village who has had
no experience with formal education so he does not know the fear of teachers. He
speaks to them as he speaks to everyone. I could have dwelled on his childhood
and background a little more in the film to bring this to the fore but I eventually
felt that it was not necessary. Rancho lives by his philosophy and his beliefs. He
makes choices which are absurd conventionally but he is not here to conform and
he does not feel the need to.

VC: Why does he appear superhuman? It was very easy for Raju, Abhijat, and
me to flesh out Rancho as we understand him completely. In fact, I see a lot
of myself in Rancho. There are just too many similarities. I was always a topper
in my school. I remember being thrown out of class because I dared to ask my
teacher who Hamlet was. In college, I found BA very boring so I used to attend
MA classes and I even studied the books prescribed for MA Economics. In my
BA exams, I scored only 55 per cent. I was a consistent topper with scores usually
ranging between eighties and nineties. I was sure that there was a mistake in the way
I had been marked. I asked for a recheck and realised that the objections to some
of the answers stemmed from the fact that I did not follow the pattern of writing
the expected answers. I was quoting writers and theories, with all due respect, which
were out of the purview of my teacher. Therefore, when I took my final BA exams,
I wrote all my references with the page numbers and the titles of the books and
the authors. This is how I topped my BA exams. What surprised and baffled me
though was the resistance of the educators to reward inventiveness. This reluctance
and rigidity is steeped in our education system. You would be surprised to know
that FTII had failed me. I was thrown out without a diploma. Then my student
film, Murder At Monkey Hill, won the National Award and was also nominated
for an Oscar. The moment I won the National Award, FTII appointed me as a
member of their governing council. In this capacity, I spoke out against the staff
as I was aware of everything that goes on there. The staff protested against me
and said that I couldn't be on the governing council because I had failed. The

329
FTII management had to pass me then and I got my diploma. They had failed
me because they wanted me to take a lot of exams, some of which I thought were
completely ridiculous. For example, they wanted us to submit a feature film script
which I never did. The reason for that was simple. I felt we were not yet trained
to do this. I protested against these unfair practices. It gives me no pleasure to say
this but I did not have any teacher to look up to, and at that stage of your life,
a guiding force can be such a boon. These experiences and the lack of guidance
became my reason to back talent. I am passionate about doing this because I never
had that privilege. I learnt the English language at the age of 16 (as late as that)
and what am I doing now? I am making a film in Hollywood. Even now, I have a
problem understanding my actors and I ask them to talk slowly because it is tough
for me to understand their accents.

I can draw many parallels but the point I am making is that Rancho is not an
unbelievable, fictional, larger-than-life character. He is probably someone who is a
little tough to understand in this world because he does not conform. We are so
happy sitting back and accepting whatever is doled out that anyone who questions,
is considered an aberration.

AJ: While writing, we did not look at Rancho as a character in the film but as the
hero of the film and he has been written like that, though he is neither superhuman
nor a comic book hero. He has the attributes of a hero and it would be dangerous
to pretend otherwise. He is an uninhibited free spirit with insatiable curiosity and
genuine queries. He does not operate with arrogance or cockiness and Aamir has
also played him with that inherent earnestness. But it would be incorrect to say
that he does not have an arc in the film or a journey. His journey in the film starts
from Joy’s suicide. He would not have taken on the system had he not seen that a
perfectly wonderful boy was driven to suicide because of the mechanical, unthinking,
ruthless system education has been reduced to. This stirs something inside him that
he cannot ignore. A clear inspiration and influence here was the film Deewar (1975).
Amitabh Bachchan is a daily wage worker at the dockyard. All workers there have
to pay extortion money to Peter, the local goon. One man refuses to pay this and
he is killed by the goons. The death of this innocent person changes Amitabh.
He decides to fight back. “Raheem Chacha ab woh hoga jo 25 saal mein nahin hua.
Agle hafie se ek aur coolie inn darindon ko hafia nahin dene wala hai” (Something
that has not happened in 25 years will happen now. Next week one more worker
will not pay the extortion money to the goons), goes the famous dialogue. Without
this death which changes him, Amitabh would have remained just a worker content

330
to earn his daily wages. This incident, its futility and cruelty, changes him. While
writing Rancho, Raju and I had discussed this scene from Deewar. Therefore, Joy's
suicide is a turning point in Rancho’s life. This is his journey. And in the course
of his own journey, he changes lives including his own.

Like Rancho, Virus’s character must have been a challenge. How did you
achieve balance there?

RH: During Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., we were shooting a scene where Boman was
to deliver a speech to the students. He improvised and added in the speech that a
doctor should be dispassionate towards his patients. He must maintain an emotional
distance to give him perspective. The exact line was: “Agar mein apni family par operate
karoonga to mere haath kampenge.” While scripting this, my debate with Boman was
that this argument is so logical and valid that it completely justifies Dr. Asthana’s
character. It makes my hero look weak. Boman looked at me and said that this
was my problem and not his. As an antagonist, he must have a point of view and
if that point of view weakens the protagonist, then the director has to make the
protagonist stronger. This has stayed with me since then. I have consciously applied
this while constructing the characters in my films. This helps in creating characters
that are real and not one dimensional. Therefore, Virus despite his quirks has a ring
of reality. His intention is not to go out there and harm students. He believes that
life is a race and if you don’t run fast enough, you would be left behind. This is
his point of view and he is unwavering in his belief.

The film starts with Farhan abandoning a flight that has already taken off. But it
was a long process before you arrived at this opening for the film. In the earlier
drafts I read, several approaches were tried including the one where you were even
contemplating bringing in Amitabh Bachchan as the narrator. How did you reach this
opening scene and why was this scene the most appropriate according to you?

RH: The starting point is always tough. The idea was to set up an extraordinarily
large activity which Farhan has to abandon at the very mention of Rancho. This
was done to establish the importance of Rancho in Farhan’s life.

AJ: Though we went along with the airplane scene to open the film, I do have an
alternate scene that happens to be my favourite. Given a chance, I would still do that
instead of this. In my favoured beginning, Farhan is a linguist and is in the middle
of a conversation between two Heads of State at the UN. He is the interpreter. He

331
leaves this session to meet Rancho and these two men are left in the lurch. There
is a lot of comedy that emerges from linguistics but we did not have enough time
to develop it so we went along with the airplane scene. The airplane scene was also
more dramatic. But these things are a matter of exploration. One explores multiple
possibilities and then chooses the one that best works for the film.

Joy’s suicide was a critical point of debate. There are drafts that had it and
several that did not. Its inclusion was probably most fiercely debated in the
entire screenplay. It was felt that this was too dark an incident for this film or
that it might dilute the revelation of Virus’s son’s death being a suicide. What
was the thought behind the suicide scene and the reason for placing it within
20 minutes of getting into the film?

VC: There was a lot of back and forth that happened over this. I had serious
doubts about whether we should include this or not. But what convinced me was
that this gave motivation to Rancho’s character. Raju took it a step further by
adding a montage and a voice-over at the editing stage. There is a small montage
with Farhan’s voice-over talking about Rancho and his quirky personality and from
there the voice-over says, “Ek aur tha bilkul Rancho jaisa.” And we cut to Joy. This
voice-over that Raju introduced at the editing table, integrated the Joy track into
the script. Otherwise, it would have been too much of a jump. It also illustrated
that a brilliant guy like Rancho can go one way or the other. He can either become
Phunsukh Wangdu or become so dejected by seeing mediocrity flourish around him
that he gives up on life.

RH: Joy’s suicide was thrown out and brought back innumerable times. Abhijat
and I were very keen to keep it as we felt that the conflict in the film would start
from there, otherwise it would just be a fun film without anything substantial in
it. Vinod and Aamir felt that it should not be there. They thought that it was
too dark and grim. It was a jarring inclusion in the film. But Abhijat and I were
convinced that this had to be there. This went on for a long time. In fact, we only
got it back into the script a month before the shoot started (September 2008).
But the debate over it continued and then finally the montage and the voice-over
during the edit, settled the matter. Earlier, the Rancho montage was not there in
the film. We had not even planned to keep it. Nevertheless, I shot it. Simply, so
that if I ever felt like reviving it, then it could be done. The feedback after the
first screening of the film we organised for a sample audience revealed that Rancho
being a mad genius was not coming across. I added the montage then and, linking

332
it with Joy’s introduction by that voice-over, made Joy both integral to the plot
and also lent him credibility.

AJ: Joy’s suicide is the spine of the film. The second-half revelations are climatic
devices. But Joy’s suicide is what makes Rancho realise that pressure to perform
is the killer and it has to be fought. It is this belief that takes Rancho’s character
and the story forward. Otherwise, why is he doing the things that he is doing? The
first half of the film would become insubstantial if we took out the suicide.
The challenge was to put this thing that worries us about the system right on top
so that we know what Rancho is fighting, and the film is saved from sinking under
the weight of this intense scene.

The interval point is a bit of a shock. The tone of the scene and the treatment
are unlike the rest of the film. There were other interval points discussed as
well before arriving at this one. How did this come about?

RH: I wanted the fact that Rancho is an imposter to be revealed earlier in the film.
I felt if we stretched revealing this till the interval, then it would seem that this
very rich kid had come into a college and was having fun. I felt that the audience
needed to be told as quickly in the film as possible that he was an imposter because
it would get the audience to feel for him. So in the earlier drafts, we came out of
the flashback one more time in the first half to reveal that Rancho was not actually
Rancho but an imposter. Then we went back into the flashback and there was a
different interval point (Farhan and Raju discovering that Pia is getting married
being one of the options considered). But after a lot of thought and work on the
script, I felt that the interval would be a great point to reveal that Rancho was not
Rancho but an imposter. Sometimes, I still feel that it might have been better to
reveal this earlier even though what we eventually put in the film is a great interval
point. In the end, these are choices that one makes. So once it was settled that this
was going to be the interval point, we narrated it to Vinod. He suggested that we
add the element of the college photograph having a different face on Rancho. This
appealed to me as it enhanced the scene.

VC: Unlike the West, Indian cinema does not follow the three-act structure which is
a two-act deal. It is a very unusual way of watching movies. No one else across the
world watches films like this — you see one part of the film, break for samosas and
chai, then you watch the rest of the film. This makes the interval point extremely
critical. Therefore, one must invest a lot of thought in where the break would
happen. In this film, my thought process was focussed on the level of interest of

333
the audience when they would go and buy their popcorn. Basically, their eagerness
to come back to find out what happens next in the film is vital. When I made
the suggestion, I did not think that Raju would retain it. It lends a thriller-like
quality to the twist. I felt that the audience would enjoy the suspense. The first
time I told Raju, he said he liked it but I do not believe anything Raju says in the
evening. It is an age-old joke between us that I am the ‘in-the moment guy’ and
he is the ‘next morning guy’. He likes to mull over and think over all the options.
He makes up his mind only after that. So I always go with what Raju feels about
things the next morning and not on the evening that they are suggested. I am
happy that he retained it.

The film initially ended with these people finding Rancho teaching in Ladakh
in a school, leading a simple happy life doing what he loves doing. Phunsukh
‘Wangdu was not in the film at all. How did the idea of Phunsukh Wangdu
fall into place?

RH: Yes, that is true. Phunsukh Wangdu was not in the film earlier. The film
ended with Farhan, Raju, and Pia reaching Ladakh and discovering that Rancho
teaches in this fascinating little school and that is his success. Whatever he wanted
to do, he did it. But we felt that maybe the audience would not understand this.
They would probably say that ‘yaar khush to hain, lekin paise to kam kamaata hai
na” (He might be happy but he earns very little money). We felt that to make the
audience understand, we had to show him to be successful in the conventional
way. This is the reason we added the Phunsukh Wangdu, coveted-scientist angle
and backtracked to plant him in the film. This is where Chatur’s quest emerged.
He was shown to be looking for someone in the entire film and at the end the
man he is searching for is Rancho. The idea was to show a man living a simple life
out of choice. Rancho has the option of signing a deal with anyone and raking in
millions but he has chosen to do differently. We felt this would help the audience
understand things better.

Another reason was that we kept feeling that the climax was not great. It seemed
that our climax was the delivery and then we were just wrapping up the film in
Ladakh. It felt weak. We, however, were doing a lot of things in Ladakh. First, we
were showing an unusual school. As Farhan, Raju, and Pia enter the school, they
see (an entire scene was there intially) that a race is going on, kids are running
and one kid falls down. Instead of carrying on, all the kids run back to pick
him up and then proceed to finish the rest of the race. These guys look at each

334
other and say that this can only be Rancho’s school. Chatur’s electrocution scene
initially had Millimeter in it. So all this material was there but these pieces were
not coming together to result in a spectacular end to the film. When we found
Phunsukh Wangdu, things started falling into place. But to clean this up and to
get it all together at the end took us a lot of time. Finally, it evolved to become
a big twist at the end.

We solved the Phunsukh Wangdu riddle in our heads in Goa. Abhijat was on
a writing visit to Mumbai. I received a call to attend the Film Festival in Goa
(IFFI, end 2007). We decided to travel to Goa for two days on this pretext. Any
reason to get away from Mumbai and write. We stayed at the same hotel as the
one where we had shot the Lage Raho song with the old people. Abhijat got very
excited about it. He has this fascination for revisiting places that have a context.
Except for the chief minister’s party the night we had arrived, we did not attend
the festival at all. We took a long walk on the beach the day we arrived and
Phunsukh Wangdu fell into place. It was quite magical and we were very happy
with the climax after that.

Phunsukh Wangdu, the real identity of Rancho, is revealed at the end. The
point of revelation that Rancho is actually Phunsukh Wangdu is something
you battled with for over a year. What made you decide the final route?

RH: This was a tough one to decide. We were unsure of this right up till the day
before we shot the scene. Abhijat and I felt that it should be revealed the moment
the friends reunite, before Chatur’s arrival. By doing this, we would have revealed this
to the audience that Rancho was Phunsukh Wangdu, the man Chatur was chasing
and Chatur’s dialogues and demeanour with Rancho after this revelation would
become even more hilarious to the audience as they would know that he would be
in for a real shock when he found out that Rancho is Phunsukh. But both Aamir
and Madhavan were of the view that the revelation should happen at the end so
that the film ends on a high note. They felt that revealing it earlier would weaken
this dramatic twist. This is when the tussle started. Abhijat and I resisted for a
long time but Aamir and Madhavan were so vehement and insistent that it became
a question in our minds also. When I was in Ladakh for the shoot, I started to
feel that maybe their suggestion holds some weight. Maybe the surprise at the end
would be a great way to end the film. So I changed it and rewrote it in Ladakh a
day before the shoot. Frankly, I still don’t know which route was better. Actually,
it is a matter of interpretation. Both routes are correct in their own way.

335
Chatur’s speech scene is a complete departure from the Raju Hirani sensibility
and the overall VCF sensibility. There were also varied opinions about the
shloka at the end of the speech. Were there any apprehensions at the time of
writing this?

RH: I was aware that what we were doing with this film, we had not done before.
There was also complete awareness of the fact that we might be panned for using
what people might label as toilet humour. There are ragging scenes with boys in
their underwear. The language is of a certain quality and other things as well,
but while writing, we realised that the campus world we had created would look
completely false if we didn’t use the language, the irreverence of youth, and the
whole college milieu while creating it. This is the way this world is and, therefore,
our job was to stay true to this world. This was the necessity of this world. This
scene we cracked when Abhijat and I were in Columbus, Ohio (April 2007). The
decision that Rancho will change Chatur’s speech was already in place but we had
not worked out the details of the scene yet. We decided to make it more challenging
for ourselves. It would have been easy to change the entire speech but if only a few
words were to be changed, then it would have been tough. Therefore, the challenge
was to write a speech that, if kept in its original format, sounded great but if you
were to change just a few words in it, then it would become completely different.
We struggled for many days to find the right words. We had thought about many
words and many ideas but nothing was good enough. We wanted it to rhyme too.
One day, we were out for a drive and we hit upon chamatkar’ and ‘balatkar’. But
after using this a few times, we felt that we needed a change because carrying an
entire speech only on a single word change might get monotonous so the hunt
for the second word started. I was in Ohio then, visiting Abhijat. We were out
for a walk when the second word struck us (dhan’ and ‘ttan). Abhijat’s daughter
Anoushka (age 12) was also with us. While Abhijat and I were talking, we cracked
this and Abhijat almost fell down laughing. We were both in splits but we could
not share this with Anoushka.

The shloka at the end is another story. It was not there in the scene. While writing
the screenplay, we had rented a small farmhouse in Pune where we used to go and
write very often. During one of our writing sojourns in this farmhouse, in some
other context and not in the context of this speech scene, Abhijat told me this
shloka. laughed to the point of tears. I decided there and then that I wanted it
in the speech scene and it was incorporated at the end of the scene. Since Chatur
already had this trait of farting and is called Silencer by everyone, the shloka fitted

336
in perfectly. But Vinod felt we should take it out. Later, even Abhijat felt the same.
But I was very keen to retain it. During the edit, Vinod said that the scene was
too long and we should take out the shloka but Vir (Vinod’s elder brother) who
saw the scene was in splits and didn’t want me to touch it. I really wanted it to be
in the film so I was happy that eventually everyone came around to it.

VC: (Blushing) I was very shocked by that shloka. But Vir loved it and I tested it
through screenings on other people and they died laughing too. My objection had
nothing to do with sensibility because as Raju said, one has to adopt the sensibility
of the film and not some general sensibility. Therefore, there were no sensibility
issues here. I just felt that the scene was getting too long and might be a bit of a
stretch. My biggest concern is always that the audience should not be bored.

AJ: The speech scene was hilarious but I must say that it was not in the script just
as a set piece for humour. It is the illustration and the turning point for the clash
of the ideologies which is the key element in the film. Rancho protests against rote
learning that our education system encourages. He is completely against it. The
‘definition of a machine’ scene introduces that. The speech scene illustrates the ills
of following blindly without understanding the meaning of things. It shows that
Chatur is end-oriented whereas Rancho worries about the journey. With the speech,
the battle of the philosophies becomes an open battle. Right after this scene, we
have the scene where Chatur and Rancho lay a bet to meet after ten years to see
who is more successful. The speech scene lent to the progression of this theme in

the film.

The shloka at the end is another story. I knew that if I told Raju this, he would
immediately want it in the film and that is what happened. Later in the edit, I too
was unsure about it like Vinod and like he said, it was not because of any sensibility
issues. It was because I felt that Rancho probably would not meddle with the
speech to this extent. He would change just two words and that would be enough
for him to drive the point home. But I am glad that Raju and Vir prevailed in the
end because the shloka is the pitce de résistance of the speech scene (laughing).

The delivery scene has invited a lot of mixed reactions from a section of the
audience. I remember you telling me that you began this film by first deciding
on the climax because that was a huge challenge you faced while writing Lage
Raho? Frankly, what were you people thinking when you decided on this as
the concluding episode in the film?

337
RH: The origin of this scene is from Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.1 had thought of this
scene where Munna gets admission into medical college. He has only done this to
spite Asthana. He has no other motivation to study at a medical college other
than his disdain for Asthana. One night, he is roaming the streets with Circuit.
They are drunk. Munna is wearing the doctor's white jacket so that he feels like
a doctor. There is a Mumbai bandh’ that day. Both of them are crossing a chawl.
A boy comes running out of the chawl and is hunting for an auto-rickshaw. His
mother is pregnant and her waters just broke. He has to rush her to the hospital
or find a doctor. He spots Munna and drags Munna into the chaw/ because he
thinks that Munna is a doctor. These guys have no idea what to do but somehow
they get through the delivery. The idea behind the scene was to get Munna to
realise the value and responsibilities of doctors. The moment he held the newborn,
this would have hit him. Now, he would really want to study medicine. The
script underwent many changes and this route was abandoned. I had told Abhijat
about it. While writing 3 Idiots, like I told you earlier, we were determined to
first decide the climax. Abhijat and I talk a lot when we are writing so this is
one of the scenes I mentioned again and Abhijat said, “Why don’t we use this
here?” Rancho could apply engineering for the delivery. This thought combined
with a short story I had read somewhere about a man who used to talk to his
baby while he was still in his mother’s womb, connected with Pia’s sister and
‘Aal izz well’, our climax, started taking shape. Then, we spent a lot of time with
gynaecologists to make it authentic. It became a big joke in office. Whenever
Vinod used to come to office and ask for us, he was told that we had gone to
the gynaecologist. Everyone teased us endlessly about our visits to gynaecologists.
One of my friends had introduced us to Dr. Sejal Desai who became our guide
while writing this scene. She told us about the various procedures by which a baby
could be delivered. The only procedure which could be combined with engineering
was the suction method. A lot of people think that this cannot happen but the
scene is totally authentic and it is possible to deliver a baby like this. At every
step, we consulted the doctors and, in a way, we wrote the scene with them. A
lot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of time were spent on this. Even during
the shoot, the doctors were there and constantly monitoring what was happening
and how it was being depicted. This is not one of those up in the air, fantasy
things that we have put in the film for the sake of a great climax.

You have often referred to the three scenes that constitute this continuous chunk
in the film as the soul of 3 Idiots: Raju’s job interview, Farhan’s conversation

338
with his father, and Rancho breaking down when they come and tell him
about their triumphs. These scenes had several rewrites before they took the
final form in which they are in the film. Why do you feel that this chunk is

the essence of 3 idiots?

RH: These are the moments in the film I am most attached to and they make me
very emotional. Even while narrating these scenes, I would often get choked with
emotion. In a way, I feel, they are the crux of the film. I have always been fond
of an underdog succeeding. I like hope. I see victory in hope. Be happy, go and
do whatever you want without fear. This is what one wants to say about life. We
had to put a lot of work into these scenes. For example, a lot of back and forth
happened in order to elevate the interview scene to the level we aimed to take it
to. It was written and rewritten several times. Initially, Raju Rastogi was only saying
things about fear, god, and superstition and he used to get the job. I felt that the
scene was flat. It lacked punch and impact. Then we hit upon the ‘attitude’ angle
which transformed the scene completely.

How this happened is quiet remarkable as well. I had read a chicken soup story
about a small boy who is asked by his teacher to write an essay about what he wants
to become. The boy writes his essay describing his dream, of owning a ranch one
day with thousands of horses. The teacher is not impressed and tells him to alter
this unrealistic aim to a more practical one. He tells him to aspire for something
more achievable as the boy comes from too poor a background to ever achieve this
dream. He also threatens to fail him in the assignment if it is not altered. The boy
comes the next day and again submits the same assignment. The teacher is furious
now. He tells him that he will surely get an F on this assignment. The boy says,
“You can keep your F Sir and I will keep my dream.” I was very moved by this
story. I narrated it to Abhijat and was itching to use it somewhere. For a year, the
subconscious thought was to apply this somewhere in the script but we could never
find the right moment or place for it. In the end, in a different form, it was used in
this scene. I think the thought here is of preserving what defines you. Once you are
willing to give that up, then that is the first step towards losing your identity and
your dreams. Farhan’s confrontation with his father, apart from writing it, was also
not an easy scene to execute. Even in the writing of it, initially, I was not entirely
satisfied with the trigger that makes the father come around. I felt maybe Farhan
has to say more, do more. Something here was not working for me. Also, I was
very unsure about executing the father’s change of heart. The tone, the blocking, the
pitch, everything had to be perfect for this scene to work. I expressed all of this to

339
Abhijat. I was very restless about this. He reassured me and said that he would do
something. He wrote this entire scene on his own and mailed it to me.

What clicked was this gesture he suggested for Farhan. The father gets very angry
during their conversation and comes and sits down on a chair. Farhan goes up to
his father and kneels down before him and talks to him. It was this act of deference
and total submission that elevated the scene. If you noticed, the tone of the scene
is not of rebellion but of persuasion. Farhan is asking for permission; he is not
informing his parents. He is appealing to them to let him live his dreams. If they
would not have come around, he would have sacrificed his dream.

Lastly, the scene where Rancho breaks down was not there in the film earlier. If
you look at it, there was no need for it technically because after these two scenes
(Raju’s job interview and Farhan’s conversation with his father), we could have
gone straight to the barber shaving off Virus’s moustache as he had lost the bet.
But I have always felt that when there is an emotion this potent, it has to play
out in full. You need to see the aftermath, otherwise it appears abrupt. The trick
to pacing a film is as much in speeding it up as in slowing it down and letting it
breathe when the screenplay demands it. I wrote this scene to bring the emotion
in the earlier scenes to its rightful conclusion.

But when we shot the scene that in its original form had Raju and Farhan come
and hug Rancho and he breaks down, I was not satisfied. I called Abhijat and asked
him about what he thought of them taking off their pants and saying, “Jahanpanah,
tussi great ho,” to Rancho. Earlier this was to happen right at the end when they
reunite in Ladakh. Abhijat liked the idea and we changed it on location. We
removed it from the climax of the film and brought it up to this point. Instead of
these boys, now Chatur takes off his pants at the end and says, “Jahanpanah, tussi
great ho. Tohfa kabool karo.”

There seems to be a design to the way 3 Idiots has been written. The drama
is carefully balanced with laughter. The audience does not cave in under the
weight of any scene. Was this intentional?

RH: This is an inherent trait in all my films. If I had my way, I would package
everything with laughter. I believe in the world that I create in my films. One
can choose to be cynical or one can choose to look at things differently. If you
really analyse the emotional, dramatic scenes, you will notice that they incite tears
of happiness and hope and not of despair and loss except for Joy's suicide. I hate

340
sadness in films. So more than design, this happens because of the way we look at
the world: our beliefs, experiences, and ideas.

AJ: I agree with Raju but it is still gratifying to see that after every dramatic scene,
we managed to diffuse the tension by making people laugh within minutes. In terms
of craft, this is a massive challenge. It can ruin a film if not done seamlessly and
effortlessly. Our inspiration for this was The Lion King. Mufasa’s death is this dark,
hard-hitting, unforgettable, and memorable moment but exactly two minutes later
you are transported to the world of ‘Hakuna Matata’. We shed tears with Simba,
we are moved and stirred but two minutes later we are singing “Hakuna Matata’
with joy and hope. Most screenplays would dwell on an event like Mufasa’s death
for at least ten minutes.

Your (Raju and Abhijat) collaboration began during Lage Raho Munna Bhai.
It continued through 3 Idiots and now you are writing another film together.
It is a delicate relationship where many things have to come together for it to
become productive. How does it work for both of you?

AJ: Raju and I share the same sensibility. Our approaches, our ideas, the path
that we want to take, are all the same. When Raju and I write, the path that we
follow is completely non-linear. We start with writing the scenes that we value. It
is a nightmare later to string them together and beat them into a narrative. But
the magic of this method is that once you do this, you have, as writers, followed
such an unknown path that the audience has no chance of second guessing the
trajectory of the film. So we first follow the magic and pen down what we treasure
most and then apply reason and bind it together. It is a rare and wonderful meeting
of minds.

RH: I spend more time with him than I do with my wife. I wish he were a woman
(laughs). Apart from him being a good writer and our sensibilities being the same
(we are both from small towns and we have shared similar experiences; our reference
points are the same), the quality I most enjoy and admire in Abhijat is that he does
not defend his scenes. Most writers spend a huge chunk of their time defending
their scenes. If I want something done differently, he understands my point of
view. This does not mean that he is not passionate about what he writes or does
not believe in his scene but it simply means that he is ready to explore. He has a
positive aura. Secondly, I don't have to walk on eggshells with him. That is a huge
relief. In cinema, you waste a lot of time, precious time, dealing with egos because

341
everyone you are dealing with is an artist. You have to think of ways and means to
convey your opinion without hurting people or offending them. This house-keeping
I don’t have to do with him. I can say what I feel without hesitation and without
any sugar-coating. It saves us a tremendous amount of time. And most importantly,
Abhijat does not give up. We could have been through a million drafts but he
does not get fatigued by the evolving screenplay. He keeps at it. I am the same so
I know that this stems from tremendous passion. Even if the shoot is on and things
need to be changed, he has that faith in me and I in him that if it makes the film
better, we will do whatever it takes. This synergy is rare. Before Abhijat and I started
working together, I never thought that I would need a writing partner or I could
work with a writing partner but now I feel it is essential to have one.

The process of screenwriting and directing holds such mystery that many find it
hard to figure out where to start. What would your suggestions be to students
aspiring to write and direct their material?

RH: I believe that formal education in some form is essential to an extent. One
does not have to enrol in an institute or course necessarily but other modes of
learning like reading, watching theatre and films can help you gather the tools and
grammar that will enable you to write and make films. But what is most critical to
preserve is the faculty to think from your heart. Once you get into theory which is
important, we tend to lose the innocence with which films were watched earlier. We
tend to view them only with an eye on the craft: there comes the central conflict;
those are the hurdles in the plot; lensing just changed; and a crane was used for
this shot, and so on, is what we start focussing on. We start viewing films purely
from the perspective of craft. The ability to think from the heart and appreciate a
film honestly vanishes. For me, to keep this faculty to think from the heart alive
is the biggest battle. This is what leads to honest work. The other thing is to try
to bring in fresh ideas. It is very tough to do that these days but the effort should
be there to achieve this.

AJ: I feel that novelty of idea is paramount. Anything you are writing or attempting
to write should not have the sound of something that has been done a hundred
times before. The approach that though it has been done before but I will write it
so well that it will work, according to me, does not work. You need to feel strongly
about the idea that you choose and you need to believe in it. It must sound unique
to you to begin with. Once you have settled on the idea, the element of time comes
in. A screenplay demands a lot of time and patience. The writing process, in case

342
quality is the goal, cannot be rushed. Therefore, you must be prepared to devote
that time. At least two to three years. Once these two commitments are made, then
for the first two or three months you must not write. You must mull over the idea.
Where do I want to go with this thought? What am I trying to say? Who are the
characters in my story? Why is what I am saying worth saying? Why should I be
writing this at all? These are the questions you should spend time answering in
these initial months. Once you have convincingly answered these for yourself, you
should start the writing process. A good technique is to keep two screenplays going
at the same time. It helps sometimes. You might love some moments but they don’t
work for a screenplay so you can always put them in the other one you are working
on or save them for some other story in the future. So you don’t hang on to your
darlings. But more than two screenplays at a time is a distraction.

VC: The only process and method I know is consistent, relentless, passionate, and
focussed hard work. Let me tell you a secret. Talent, as is the popular belief, is not
inborn. It is something you have to work for. If you work hard enough, you can
achieve anything. That is the key to it all.

THINGS OF BEAUTY
A thing of beauty is a joy forever ...
— John Keats

Praise this world to the Angel ... show him
some simple thing, refashioned by age after age,
till it lives in our hands and eyes as a part of ourselves.

— Rainer Maria Rilke

Three minutes of cinema time ...

A young lady who hates her father’s archenemy and furiously confronts him must
within the next three minutes break off her engagement with her fiancé, fall
hopelessly in love with the same archenemy, and convincingly fantasise singing a
rain-drenched love song with him.

The girl is Pia; the nemesis she must confront is Rancho; the fiancé she must plunk
is Suhas, the Price Tag; and the song she must sing is “Zoobi Doobi’.

The question is: How do we achieve this sea change within three minutes of cinema
time?

Raju and I ponder over this question in New York City over two cups of tea. We
know with absolute certainty that we can’t spend a single extra minute garnishing
the love story. Our screenplay, completed except for this one problem, is already
half-an-hour longer than we would ideally want. And the placement of the love
song is particularly precarious: around the 75th minute into the film, a time when
most people are itching to leave either for the restroom or for some popcorn. If the
screenplay sags even for a second before the song, audiences the world over would
end up using the song as a restroom break. And if they did so, they wouldn't return
from such a mass exodus in time for the interval point, the biggest twist and the
most crucial plot-point of the story.

We can't let them go for a break. Which means Pia must fall in love with her
archenemy in no time at all. But how?

In Shakespeare’s Richard III, Princess Anne goes to slay her husband’s murderer
Richard, only to get engaged to him in the same scene, mesmerised by his
allure. Richard later boasts: “Was ever a woman in this humor wooed? Was ever a
woman in this humor won?” remind Raju of the scene. Raju wryly reminds me that
we are not Shakespeare. Point taken. So how do lesser mortals achieve this effect?

Through some mundane, everyday thing. Some simple object, refashioned age after
age. In this case, it’s going to be Pia’s watch.

In their first meeting, Rancho had seen Pia being reprimanded by her brand-obsessed
fiancé for wearing a cheap watch at her sister’s wedding. When we wrote that scene,
we had not seen the potential of the watch as a /eitmotif. Now, in New York City,
where I have followed Raju from Columbus on the last leg of his US trip in the
hope that we can crack the Pia-Rancho track before his departure to India, we
decide to play with the watch and see what happens.

What happens is a little miracle that a screenwriter encounters once in about three
or four years.

Opening salvo with the watch: it helps Rancho deflate Pia’s fiancé with one swift
‘demo: Rancho hides the expensive watch that the fiancé has just bought for Pia
and tells him that she has lost it. This simple ruse brings rushing to the fore all the
maniacal materialism, brand-obsession, price-consciousness, and the sheer rudeness of
the fiancé. Moments later, stunned and insulted, Pia breaks off the engagement.

Salvo two: Rancho has vanquished Pia’s fiancé but not yet won her over. It happens
in an instant, through a single innocuous remark. He congratulates Pia for showing
the courage in breaking off with her fiancé and points out that ‘Ab tum jab chaho
apni maa ki ghadi pehan sakti ho” (Now you are free to wear your mom's watch).
This single sentence causes an explosion in Pia’s cognitive universe. In a flash, it
alters her perception, memory, reasoning, and finally her judgment. How does Rancho
know that the cheap watch she was wearing at her sister’s wedding once belonged to her
mother? Because he could reason that the bride's sister, otherwise dressed opulently,

348
could be wearing one object so humble only for its sentimental value. Ergo he
possesses sensitivity and tenderness that she had never suspected he did!

Salvo three: The next time Pia meets Rancho, she holds out her wrist — she is
wearing her mother’s watch. Without a single word, through the semiotics of that
one gesture, she conveys to him that she has forgiven him his ruthless deconstruction
and debunking of her father’s and her fiancé’s philosophies, embraced his values and
is now firmly in his camp. In fact, she loves him.

Thus, the watch helps us tide over one of the trickiest plot points that had threatened
to derail our screenplay. Even more importantly, it infuses Rancho’s character with
one quality that sets him apart from almost all characters before him in Indian
cinema — authenticity. When Pia’s fiancé is ranting about the astronomical price of
the lost limited edition watch, Rancho gently retorts, “Meri to dhai sau ki hai yaar,
lekin time wohi batati hai” (Mine is inexpensive, but shows the same time). [This
is an incident that we borrowed almost verbatim from Vidhu Vinod Chopra’ life,
when as a young and struggling student, he could not ignore the slight about his
humble watch from an affluent relative.) This remark by Rancho is emblematic of
his authentic nature and the very first overt declaration of one of his many priorities:
value over price, passion over pragmatism, excellence over success, understanding
over information, communication over jargon, education over training, knowledge
over diploma, and a mother’s watch over a limited-edition watch!

All we asked of the watch was to save us a few minutes. What it gifted us was the
kernel, the essence, the very nucleus of the film.

Strangely, we stumbled on the extraordinary potential of objects through a problem
that we faced very early in the screenplay, a problem that is every writer’s nightmare:
a big cliché.

The scene: The Director’s motivational speech to the freshmen on their first day

at college.

Audiences around the world have heard and witnessed such spiel a zillion times,
ranging from the great bombast in Patton and Full Metal Jacket to the lamest
offerings from the trashiest of campus flicks.

Tom Stoppard, the great English playwright, came to the rescue. Not in person,
but in spirit — boleto Chetana. Stoppard thrives on introducing bizarre objects into
his plays and later providing perfectly plausible explanations for them. One of his

349
plays begins with a man opening the door of his apartment with shaving foam on
his face, a bow and an arrow in one hand and a tortoise in the other to find a
policeman carrying a bouquet of flowers standing outside. Soon enough, Stoppard
gives us an entirely convincing reason for this outlandish spectacle. Inspired by
Stoppard’s virtuosity, the cuckoo’ nest, complete with the fake bird atop it, was born.
The Director carries this strange object in his hand as he strides down the imposing
corridors. The audience wonders about the logic of this peculiar object, till in his
speech, the Director links it with competition that abounds in nature: a hoel kills
off its competition by pushing the host bird’s eggs out of the nest. As the audience
gets involved in the story of the koe/ and ruthless competition, we have successfully
negated a big cliché. Later in the same scene, instead of ending the speech with
rhetoric or polemics, we take it to its climax with another object: the Director takes
out a gleaming astronaut’ pen, holds it up enticingly as the ultimate trophy for the
students. Through Rancho’s healthy disrespect for the pen, and his archrival Chatur’s
salivating regard for it, we were able to immediately and wordlessly set up the clash
between two conflicting philosophies: obsession with success versus excellence. Once
again, an inanimate object was helping us not merely to scale over a plot hurdle
but in intensifying the film as a comedy of ideas.

Since one speech was served so ably by two diverse objects, Raju and I intuitively
grasped that inanimate objects would play a seminal role in the story. In fact, as
I have lately grown fond of saying, they would form the DNA of the film.

For Lage Raho Munna Bhai, we had discovered about halfway through the scripting
process that the DNA of the film was ‘olta kar’ or do the opposite — the principal
of inversion. For constraints of space, I can only give one quick example of this.

 

‘When Munna is asked how to deal with a boy who desecrated Gandhi's statue,
from behind him Bapu answers: “Give more stones to the lad, tell him to topple
all my statues.” This is clearly inverse to the answer that the audience is likely to
postulate in their heads and therefore highly intriguing because they cannot second
guess what will follow. Throughout Lage Raho Munna Bhai, whenever in trouble,
we had summoned this principal of inversion.

For Broken Horses, another screenplay I co-authored with Vinod, the DNA is memory;
the childhood memory of a mentally challenged character. Whenever faced with major
dilemmas, he summons not his faculty of reasoning but the faculty of reminiscence:
what his parents taught him when he was little. In every major dramatic scene, we
found ourselves relying utterly on memory for solutions.

350
For 3 Idiots, which was being written at the same time as Broken Horses, we realised
that the DNA was objects. Objects marked the comic and the tragic, the dramatic
and the philosophical beats of the film with equal felicity. To chronicle the genesis
of each object that served us so valiantly for transfusing red corpuscles into our
scenes would fill a book longer than the screenplay. But here is the briefest account
of our extended encounter with things.

The Comic Objects

The empty gift envelopes, the mounds of food on the plates of three friends, and most
crucially, the mint chutney are irreplaceable for the comic flavour of the scene where
Rancho gatecrashes Pia’s sister’s wedding. Of these, the mint chutney proved to be
a powerful motif. Rancho first drops it on Suhas’s shoes to determine their price.
We went on to use it in three more scenes:

A. In the song ‘Zoobi Doobi’ where Pia imagines Rancho as a chef eulogising
the virtues of the “ever-useful mint chutney that, apart from being delicious,
also reveals a man’s character.”

B. The scene where a drunken Pia barges into Rancho’s room and he, scrupulously
small town, offers her dhokla with mint chutney to distract her from her
amorous advances. This leads to the memorable lines about the menacing
names of innocuous Gujarati food items like dhokla, fafda, thepla that sound
like missiles to Pia.

C. The scene of Pia’s wedding, when to stop the groom from heading for the
altar, Raju Rastogi irons his clothes with an iron drenched in mint chutney.
As promised, the chutney reveals the groom’s character instantly as Pia hears
him scream out the price of his ruined wedding dress.

Our most innovative comic object, however, is not the mint chutney. The pride of
that place must go to an object so humble, so self-effacing that most people would
not even remember it — the heart-rate monitor in the hospital where Raju Rastogi lay
in a coma after his suicidal ‘high jump’. This object served an extraordinary purpose.
It saved Reel No. 7 of the film from becoming so grave, heavy, and weighty that
it could have sunk the entire film. This, by far, is our favourite reel of the film. It
starts with the Director’s brutal act of compelling Rastogi to type the letter of his
own rustication — an act that drives Rastogi into attempting suicide and culminates,
after Rastogi’s recovery, in the twin movement of Farhan convincing his father that

351
he does not want to become an engineer and Rastogi successfully facing a crucial
job interview. This reel is clearly the heart of 3 Idiots. The problem was that scene
after overwhelmingly moving scene, this was also by far the grimmest, darkest, and
the longest (about 20 minutes) reel of the film. We desperately needed to bring
some levity, some joy to this beat of the story. Since the searing dramatic scenes
allowed no scope for comic maneuvering, we came up with what I consider to be
the most daring and audacious tricks of our screenwriting careers — we decided to
lace the musical interludes of the song ‘Jaane Nahi Denge Tujhe’ with comedy. But
hold on! Swanand Kirkere has written those stanzas so movingly and Sonu Nigam
has sung them with such unbridled emotionalism that how the hell can we bring
in comedy into the interludes?

Well, with the help of the little heart-rate monitor.

Knowing that Rastogi’s brain responds to voice despite the coma, Rancho begins to
tell outrageous and funny lies to him to try and revive him. Though the idea was
comic, we realised that it would fall flat since the lies would not elicit a response
from the coma-stricken Rastogi. This is where the heart-rate monitor stepped in.
Whenever Rastogi responds to anything that is said, his heart rate increases and
the graph on the monitor alters. The dance of this graph started drawing laughter
from the audience at every screening. The more outrageous the lie or the action,
the more vibrant the externalisation of Rastogi’s inner thoughts. When Rancho
finally utters the most outrageous lie that poor Farhan would marry Rastogi’s sister
without any dowry, the seismic dance of the white graph reaches a frenzied climax.
The next moment the coma-stricken patient's right hand moves. Life returns to his
limbs, hope returns to his friends’ hearts and we, the writers, about to lose our
comic licenses for non-use, get a fresh lease of life. Thank you, monitor!

Apart from these major objects, there were many minor ones that came fleetingly
into the film to help us find chuckles, guffaws, and occasionally, that big explosive
theatre-shaking laughter that makes the years of the screenwriter’s toil totally
worthwhile: the spoon at the end of the rod that Rancho improvises to electrocute
the urinating senior; the single grey hair that is kneaded into the flour as the friends
are eating rotis at the Rastogi house; Chatur’s hand-crafied biscuits from San Francisco
that he so jealously guards for Phunsukh Wangdu, the comic device that enabled
us to weave in the Wangdu track without drawing attention to it; the urn of ashes
that the friends so shockingly and irreverently waylay and through the threat of
immersing the ashes in the sewer, blackmail the fake Rancho into revealing the secret

352
of the real Rancho being an imposter, thus enabling us to make a long exposition
dramatic and funny. Pia’s helmet helped us negate the sentimentality and cliché of
Rancho’s dream [“Pia, tum roz dulhan ke costume mein scooter pe baith kar mere
sapne mein aati ho. Ghoongat ki jagah apna helmet uthaati ho....” (Every night you
ride into my dreams on your scooter, dressed as a bride. Instead of the veil, you
lift your helmet...) ] and last but not least, the two keys to the Director's office that
are flung at Farhan, one by Rancho and the other by the Director, one from a dear
friend and the other from a dreaded foe, one stolen and the other legitimate but
both thrown at him with the same aim: to save a human life.

The Dramatic Objects

A chopper with a surveillance camera mounted atop, rises in the air and soars. It
seems to embody the joy and goodwill of the entire campus in its flight. With
the crowd beneath giving it rousing cheers, it continues upwards like Shelley's
Skylark — “Soaring doth thou sing, and singing ever soarest.” Rancho, remote in his
hand, guides this invention to the window of its originator, Joy Lobo, hoping to
catch his astonishment and euphoria on the mounted camera ... and Joy Lobo
hangs from the ceiling fan, a failure in his own eyes. His most brilliant success,
the flying camera, hovers outside his window, recoding the inescapable evidence of

his flight from this world.

This is the biggest turning point in the film. From this point on, Rancho, though
an imposter, living under an alias and hence keen on keeping a low profile, takes
off his gloves and takes on the system.

I am ashamed to admit that for one full year, for the first five or six drafts of
the screenplay, we had something as lame as sleeping pills as the means of Joy’s
demise. Peel off a few drafts of the screenplay, and what you stare at is pure
mediocrity!

A few rings, a wheelchair, a laptop, and a letter, these simple objects provided us
with the bulwark for the most important beat of the story in 3 Idiots — the twin
movement where Raju Rastogi, a changed man after his suicide attempt, fearlessly
faces a job interview and Farhan, unyielding but loving, wins his father’s blessings
for leaving engineering and embracing photography. Without the aid of objects,
the scenes would have needed so many lines of dialogue to convey the complex
emotions that they would have degenerated into sermons. Objects helped us slash
the dialogue and deepen the emotion.

353
Before facing the job interview, Raju Rastogi takes off his lucky rings that embody
all his superstitions and fears and discards them in a metallic bedpan. CLANG!
Wordlessly, with that mutinous clang, the hitherto weak man has trashed his old
fearful self. Later, the wheelchair is crucial to the scene when he faces the interview
panel. More than what he has lost, the wheelchair represents what he has gained:
“Dono taange tudvaake apne pairon pe khada rahena seekha hai” (It took two broken
legs to get me up on my feet). The same scene, without changing a single line
of dialogue, with Rastogi sitting in an ordinary chair would never have had the
same impact.

A laptop versus a letter — that is the essence of the encounter between Farhan
and his father. The letter is Farhan’s dream, written five years ago to his revered
photographer requesting apprenticeship but never posted for fear of breaking his
father’s heart. Rancho sends it out without Farhan’s knowledge and lo! the photographer
answers, inviting Farhan to the Brazilian rainforest to work with him. Now Farhan
stands at two divergent roads, one that leads him to engineering and the other to
his passion, photography. Which one will he take? At this very moment, Farhan’s
father is proudly showing his mother the brand new laptop, a gift for Farhan, in
anticipation of a plush new engineering job. The laptop represents the recompense
for all the sacrifices and hardships that the father has undertaken for the education
of his son and all his solid and conservative hopes of a good life for his son. In
this sense, the laptop is the exact opposite of the sense of adventure, uncertainty
and passion that the letter represents. The scene becomes the battleground for two
disparate philosophies through two commonplace objects. When Farhan, without
an ounce of anger or bitterness, with immense love and respect, makes his father
see the validity of his argument, the letter wins. The father tells the mother to
return the laptop and buy a professional camera for his son.

Another such scene where two rival philosophies clash appears earlier in the film —
the scene of the vital bet between Chatur and Rancho. It is a clash not of individuals
but of priorities and values: Chatur’s obsession with success versus Rancho’s respect
for excellence. The rivals decide on a date ten years later, when they will meet and
compare notes on who won and who lost. While there is no overt use of objects in
the scene, we achieved the ‘concretisation’ or the ‘solidification’ effect through getting
Chatur to carve out a date on the mossy wall of the terrace. By being engraved on
the wall, the date became tangible, solid, permanent. It received an import that it
lacked when it was merely uttered verbally in earlier drafts. Chatur carves the date
not merely on the wall but also on the psyche of the audience.

354
Perhaps the most telling example of this ‘solidification’ or ‘concretisation’ of a scene
is the interval point of the film. Both Raju and I were extremely proud of our twist:
afier a long and eventful journey, the friends seem to reach Rancho, but when Farhan
puts his hand on the man’ shoulder, the man who turns and looks at them is not their
friend. It is a complete stranger. The friends are shocked. INTERMISSION. When we
narrated this scene to Vinod, he didn’t share our enthusiasm. He was uneasy and
restless till he realised what he was missing in the scene. A tangible deepening of
the mystery. Vinod felt that without solid evidence of some kind, the audience
might take the encounter with the wrong man as some minor misunderstanding,
a communication gaffe that might soon be sorted out. So he added a few extra
seconds to our scene: Afier meeting the stranger, Farhan sees on the wall, a group photo
of the classmates, featuring all three friends but the place where Rancho sat in the real
photo is now occupied by this total stranger. The wrong man. INTERMISSION. The
inanimate photo provides the scene with the final turn of the screw. The nebulous
mystery suddenly becomes concrete. The plot thickens.

Am I reading too much into this concept of ‘solidification’ or ‘concretisation’
through objects? Am I zealously overanalysing a moot point? Are there no major
scenes in 3 Idiots that do not rely on objects? Wrong. In fact, the most famous
scene of the film, Chatur’s speech that goes outrageously wrong [chamatkar versus
balatkar, dhan versus sttun] relies entirely on wordplay. So does my favorite scene:
Rancho’s deliberately obscure, whimsical, and wooly-headed definition of books
[“Instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information;
that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hard-bound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with
foreword, introduction, table-of-contents, index; that are intended for the enlightenment,
understanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through the
sensory route of vision. Sometimes touch.”] In both these scenes we relied exclusively
on verbal dexterity. In one instance crude, in the other, sophisticated. Do these
scenes, then, constitute the antithesis of my argument? Hardly. Because these scenes,
if anything, serve to demonstrate the devastating effects of the lack of ‘concrete’
understanding and ‘solid’ conceptual clarity that plague our educational system.
The wordplay scenes are meant, as Rancho would put it, to be a ‘demo’ of what
obfuscation, empty jargon, hyperbole, pomposity, rote learning bring upon us —

nothing but ‘balaktkar pe balatkar’.

Objects were our closest allies for three years. Like a friend that you can confidently
call up in the middle of the night at the time of a crisis, we knocked on the door of
objects every time we were in trouble. Every time, they responded generously. Most

355
times, like good friends, they didn’t make a big show of the help they had extended
and remained largely inconspicuous. Almost invisible. But every object I listed here
is now a part of what Rogers and Hammerstein have famously described as “a few
of my favorite things.” Right from the official stamp that seals Farhan’s fate at the
beginning of the film, to the astronauts pen that with one signature turns Chatur’s
gloating victory into a humiliating defeat at the very end of the film, 3 Idiots, could
not have been written without dreaming up hundreds of such objects. The most
menial of these objects, are for me, things of beauty. They took our hollow scenes
and filled them with humor or drama; they took our most abstract concepts and
made them accessible.

In Shakepeare’s words, they gave “the airy nothing a local habitation and a name.”

CASTING A SPELL
From the suppressed frustration of the hospital sweeper in Munna Bhai M.B.B.S,
the helplessness of the retired man who breaks into an impromptu stripping act
to get his pension, to the sparkling purity of Chhote in 3 idiots, while it may be
difficult for us to recall the names of the actors who played these roles, their faces
will remain forever etched in our memories; the characters merging into these actors
making the on-screen persona inseparable from the one in reality.

Rajkumar Hirani believes that the face maketh the character. If anything comes as
a close second to the script in his school of filmmaking, it is casting. Every face
visible in a Rajkumar Hirani film has been hand-picked by him. “Casting is half
the job done as far as characters in the film are concerned. Sometimes, we find the
right people and at times, the right people find us,” says the man who drives his
ADs (assistant directors) and casting team literally up the wall even for the right
junior artists meant to provide the ‘background’ in a scene.

Tt took Raju a year to freeze on the actor for Joy Lobo’s father in 3 Idiots, a character
that appears for barely two minutes on screen. Over five hundred screen tests later,
he exclaimed with frustration, “Maybe honest faces are vanishing from this planet.”
The brief was to find a face that would be the epitome of selfless love, kindness,
and innocence. Every heart in the theatre would break when he mourned his son’s
untimely death. Raju’s associate, Rajesh Mapuskar, came to the rescue and suggested
child actor, Madhav Vaze, from the acclaimed Marathi film Shyamchi Ayee (Shyam’s
mother) made in 1953. He would be of the right age now to play the role. The
hunt for the actor began and he was finally located in Pune. The only question
was: had Madhav’s face retained the same stirring innocence it had fifty-six years
ago? One look at him and Raju knew he had found Mr. Lobo.

And sometimes, the right actor finds his/her way to the right role. Every project
goes through various stages of casting. A single change in the script could have
one consider someone else rather than the actor initially under consideration for a
particular role. If one were to imagine anyone other than Aamir Khan as Rancho,
Kareena Kapoor as Pia, or Sanjay Dutt as Munna Bhai, the entire perception and
tone of these characters would change in our heads.

The principal cast of 3 Idiots came together with all the serendipitous twists and
turns of a commercial potboiler.

@ RANCHO AAMIR KHAN

I never thought of casting Aamir in 3 Idiots. In his case, it is the right man finding
his way to the right role. Aamir, in real life, is Rancho.
— Rajkumar Hirani

We had actually not thought of Aamir for 3 Idiots. I happened to call him for Rajesh
Mapuskar’s film Ferrari ki Sawari. During that time, we were also in the process of
casting for 3 Idiots. Aamir asked me if there was anything that Raju was doing because
he was keen to work with him. I immediately called him in for a narration of 3 Idiots.
And just like that, we found Rancho.

— Vidhu Vinod Chopra

In the twenty-six years that Aamir Khan has spent in the film industry, he and
Vidhu Vinod Chopra have met and spoken about several projects. Vinod had
offered 1942: A Love Story to Aamir but that fell through. After that, Aamir became
accustomed to Vinod calling him once every few years and invariably asking for his
dates for projects that were to begin shooting a month later. Aamir would always
hear the script but decline because he needed more time to prepare. Moreover, he
reasoned that if Vinod called him barely a month before the principal photography
for a project was to begin, then he was anyway not the man Vinod needed for

the job.

So when in late 2007, his phone rang with Vinod’s name flashing on the display
screen, Aamir assumed that it was one of Vinod’s regular ‘once-in-four-years’ calls.
Vinod had called to discuss a project still in the process of being written. The
conversation went something like this ...

Aamir: “Yaar tu mujhe yeh sab filmein offer karta rehta hai, why don't you ever
offer me a film with Raju?”
(You keep offering me these films but why don’t you ever offer me a film
with Raju?)

360
Vinod: “Bulaonga to karega tu?”
(IFT call you, will you do it?)

Aamir: “Script achchi lagegi to zaroor karoonga.”

(If I like the script, I will definitely do it.)

Vinod: “To phir aaja kal aur sunn le.”
(Then come tomorrow and hear it.)

Unaware that Raju had a ready script or was even working on a project, Aamir was
stunned by the turn of events. Vinod had managed to stump him yet again.

But this time things did work out.

You had expressed a desire to work with Raju. Both of you had even met and
discussed a project. Why did things not work out earlier?

I have very high regard for Raju’s work and for Raju as a person. The first time
we met was at the premiere of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. | loved the film and thought
it was wonderful. A little over six months after that, Raju called me to discuss an
idea he had for a film. This was before Lage Raho. 1 was travelling then, but we
decided to meet the moment I was back in town. After I returned, Raju came to
meet me and told me that things had changed. In fact, the morning of the day we
met, he decided that the idea he was to share with me, would now be used to do
the second innings of Munna Bhai. 1 was still curious to hear of the idea. When
I heard it, I thought it was a fantastic idea and completely suited the Munna Bhai
genre. And Sanjay would do a great job but at the same time I felt that I had
missed out on an opportunity.

What drew me to Raju was his unique style of filmmaking. I had observed in the
two Munna Bhai films that he views his characters with a lot of warmth. So even if
it is a bad guy in his film, his approach to the character is very warm. In his work,
there is a certain joy and simplicity which is what appeals to me and to all of us.
Also, Raju is a straightforward person who you take to instantly. He has a basic respect
and regard for each and every person he deals with, no matter who they are.

After the first narration, what was your reaction to the script?

My first reaction to the script was one of disappointment. It did not work for me
and if Raju had still wanted to make it the way it was then, I would have had to

361
opt out. I felt sad because I really wanted to work with him. The script had a lot
of potential but it was not in place as yet. I expressed my reservations to Raju.
He heard me out and said that he agreed with quite a few of my points. He told
me to give him some time and then he came back after about two months. When
I heard the script the second time round, I liked it. A lot of the issues I had raised
and he had agreed with, had been addressed.

‘What were the problems that you had with the first version of the script that
was narrated to you?

My basic problem was that Rancho was too heroic in the first draft. He was cocky
and belting out one smart line after another. I felt he should behave like a normal
guy. For example, in the introduction scene, initially, he was heroic in the way he
faced the guys who were ragging him. It was Rancho’s attitude and not the scene
that was a problem for me. The scene has stayed pretty much the same as it had
been earlier. Rancho’s attitude did not make sense to me. A young boy who comes
into the first year should be scared when he faces his seniors. He cannot be this
guy who comes in and churns out smart lines. He came across as too confident
and too sure of himself. But as I understood him, he seemed to me a guy who is
normal. He does not really know how to face guys who are stronger than him and
are bullying him. That is the reason he runs away and hides in his room.

The tone initially was of one-upmanship and I felt that Rancho should not really
care about that. I wanted him to be scared in the ragging scene and do things out
of fear and not out of knowing how to handle these tough situations. Similarly,
in the scene where the Director addresses the first year students and talks to them
about the astronaut’s pen, had I said my lines in a cocky manner, then the character
would have comes across differently but when the lines are said with a sense of
excitement as though the idea has just occurred to the character, and he thinks it
is a damn good one, so he just says it out loud because he wants to share it, that
takes on a different colour altogether. Rancho is enthusiastic about his thoughts
and shares them spontaneously but he does not know why the others are laughing
because he has not said anything meaning to be funny. Yet, it comes across as a
joke. Other people find it funny. This is broadly what I had a problem with. It
was the crystallisation of the core thought that I was excited about: what the film
is trying to say — chase excellence and not success — and this is what I wanted
coming through in Rancho.

362
You were not convinced about playing a 20-year-old student in the film. What
made you change your mind?

When I read the script, I did not feel that Rancho is me because Rancho is a
naturally brilliant guy and I don’t see myself as that. Rancho’s philosophy in life
all along I have been following but as a personality he is a little quirky. I don’t see
myself as that. But broadly speaking, how he lives his life is similar to how I live
mine but when I was reading the script, I didn’t see it that way. Perhaps I don’t see
myself that way, so I couldn’t relate myself to him. However, the interesting thing
that happened was that I told Raju what I felt: “Though I love the script, how am
I going to fit this role? I am 43 now and by the time we make the film, I will be
44 and I have to play a 20-year-old so I don’t think I am the right guy for this
film. I personally feel you should cast someone in that age group.” I even offered
to help him find a younger actor for the role. My fear was that fundamentally
if people didn’t accept me as a 20-year-old, then the whole film would go for a
toss. And that would not be worth it. You are making an entire film. There is too
much hard work involved so why should you let the fate of the film hinge on a
weak point. Your lead actor is 44 and he is going to play a 20-year-old. Despite
not being convinced of it ourselves, if we still went ahead and shot the film, and
it looked bad, then what were we going to do? This is when Raju spoke to me at
length. I think during our interaction leading up to this conversation, Raju had
become increasingly convinced about me playing Rancho. Maybe to start with, he
was not totally convinced. I don’t know what was going through his mind but I felt
that somewhere along the way, he became surer about me doing the film. Perhaps
the interaction helped him in his head as well. The first thing he said was that he
thought I looked young. Second, he felt that I could pull it off as I have often
pulled off things that people have not expected me to. He gave me the example of
Ghajini. His logic was that if I could pull that off, why not this? I kept countering
him by saying that there were limits to what one can do physically. Lastly, he said,
“Throughout your career, you have been like Rancho. You have taken paths that are
unconventional. You have not followed any rules. Instead you have broken them.
You have chased excellence and success has come after that. When you play Rancho,
the audience is going to believe you as opposed to some other actor who has been
chasing success in reality but spouts these lines on screen. You will bring a lot of
credibility to the character and that is why I want you to play it.” This is what his
opinion was but I kept insisting on finding a younger actor. This discussion went
on. What eventually helped me make up my mind was Raju’s faith in me. We spent

363
a lot of time together and discussed many drafts of the script and throughout the
process Raju was certain that he wanted me for the role. I instinctively trust Raju
as a director. I trust his judgement and instinct. I might not be able to see myself
in a particular way but if the director is able to see me that way, and feel enthused
and excited about it, then that is important to me.

I am so glad he pushed me. I decided to go with Raju’s judgment. His faith in me,
my intense desire to work with him and, of course, what he was making convinced
me to take on the challenge.

Once you were convinced and you signed the film, what was your approach
to Rancho?

I felt Rancho is boyish and transparent. He has a clean heart so most of what he
thinks and feels is quite evident to people. Had I actually been 20 years old, I might
have played the character differently. I don’t know how I would have played it but
it would have been different. At this age, I had the additional burden of pulling off
playing a guy half my age. I had to approach him differently. I had to work on my
mannerisms and the way I look to cut the age. I was really bulked up for Ghajini
so I lost a lot of muscle. I tried to look as small as possible in order to look boyish.
I wore oversized clothes. I had to internalise the mannerisms because if you don’t
internalise them, they come out totally fake. In my head, when I was constructing
him, I felt he is a guy who is constantly moving. His mind is buzzing. So he seldom
stays still. He is either scratching his head, shifting from one foot to the other or
shaking his head. He is quick. There is so much going on in his head that he has a
lot of buzz in him. That is how I saw him. And because he is transparent, all that
is going on inside him comes out spontaneously. This trait helped me negotiate the
smart lines because the lines are very smart. I felt that if he is so smart, confident, and
cocky, then he will become a pain in the neck after a point. To make him likeable,
the audience has to feel he is innocent. Let me give you a ‘demo’ (smiles). One of
my toughest scenes in the film was when Rancho confronts the Director after Joy's
death. Those are some pretty heavy lines. You might feel those things but to actually
go and tell the head of your educational institute all that and to actually provoke
him without being asked anything is a rather extreme thing to do. The insinuation
of Rancho’s words is severe. How does one pull this off? Raju and I even considered
at one point to have Rancho drunk in this scene but then we did not go down that
route. The best way then to go about it, and which is what I did, would be to play
him as emotionally overwrought. He is so grief-stricken that he goes and says what

364
he feels without thinking of the consequences. And the only way to balance the
outspokenness of the earlier scene would be to show a degree of fear when he is in
the Director's office the next morning. He is not taking on the Director or playing
this like a challenge. He is making a plea. I am saying a lot of harsh things to the
Director and, therefore, I cannot come from a position of arrogance.

Basically, I played Rancho with a different attitude. He is just being plain honest
because he is innocent enough to be honest. He might be scared but he has to
say what he feels because that is who he is. The smart lines, I know, needed to be
retained but as an actor, I had to say them in a way that made them palatable.

Farhan and Raju, as characters, were most likely to have the audience behind
them because most people would identify either with Farhan or with Raju.
Rancho is a man you admire but not someone who evokes sympathy or empathy.
Was this a concern for you?

I was aware of this but it was not a concern for me. One of the problems with
Rancho, speaking from a purely dramatic point of view, is that he has no flaws.
When the character does not have flaws, you may admire the character but you don’t
emotionally connect with the character because he does not have any problems. He
does not need your help. And he is succeeding in whatever he does, therefore, there
is no sympathy or empathy for him. As an audience you don’t emotionally invest
in him. For example, in Taare Zameen Par, your heart goes out to Ishaan because
you see the trouble he is going through. You are totally behind him as a viewer. It
is a very author-backed character. The characters in 3 /diots with the potential of
a strong emotional connect with the audience are Farhan and Raju. These are the
two who have problems. There is a growth in these characters that results in their
transformation through the film. In Rancho, there is no growth. He is the same
from the beginning to the end. It was a very big challenge for me to play Rancho
because emotionally he is not author-backed. His only problem is that he loves Pia
but cannot marry her. But that is not the main plot. This was another reason it
was essential to not make him oversmart. He would have got on everyone’s nerves.
I warned Raju about this in the beginning that we would have to be careful with
this guy or he would be in danger of going overboard. I told him that he would
have to be careful as a director and watch out and not let me slip up anywhere.

And I think somewhere what works for Rancho is the screenplay because the
screenplay really supports him. The story is about two friends who are looking for

365
their friend. It is through their intensity, their warmth, and their love for this guy
that the audience emotionally connects with Rancho, Whenever I read the script,
I always cried in Farhan’s scene with his father and Raju’s job interview scene
but I never cried for Rancho. I never felt bad for him. It was a task to engage with
him emotionally. That came from the bonding and love that Sharman and Maddy
brought for Rancho in their performances. The warmth they feel towards Rancho
seeps through to the audience. Again, at another level, the screenplay is very clever
because throughout the film, you are looking for Rancho and you have only seen
flashes of him through Farhan’s eyes. We have not met him as yet. You meet him
head-on only at the end where he is himself and not a person who is being looked
at from someone else’s point of view.

The tenderness, love, and warmth the three friends share warms the viewer to
Rancho. The emotional high point for Rancho’s character is when he sits around
waiting nervously for his friends to return from the situations (Farhan confronts
his father and Raju goes for a job interview) they have gone to face, and the
moment he realises that they have returned triumphant from these situations, he

breaks down.

You were not convinced about Joy’s suicide being in the film for a long time.
You opposed it vehemently. Why was that?

At the script level, I felt that it might not be necessary. The point was coming
through in any case. It is accomplished through Virus’s character as his son had
committed suicide. But the actual reason is a connected thing. If the suicide was
retained, then the two scenes that came right after it would be very tough to
negotiate for me. I was not convinced that people would buy those scenes because,
like we just discussed, Rancho is saying some very provocative and harsh things to
the Director. See, either the tone of the film is at such a high pitch that saying all
this to the Director is alright because the entire film is like that, but we were not
doing that. So this worried me. The graveyard scene and the scene after that were
tough. Right after those is the classroom scene where he is challenging the authority
of the Director and getting away with it. That line was a very tricky one: “Nahin
Sir, mein aap ko engineering nahin sikha raha, mein to aapko yeh sikha raha tha ke
padhate kaise hain.” (1 am not teaching you engineering Sir, I am teaching you how
to teach). I thought the audience would beat us for this. I had to really struggle
to carry this off. I thought it would be best for Rancho to say this cheekily, pick
up his bag, and bolt out of there. If I had said these lines in a heroic way or in

366
a manner which suggested that I was taking on the Director, then we would have
been doomed.

But coming back to Joy’s suicide, in hindsight, when I see the film, I think Raju
was right about keeping the suicide just like he was right about all the decisions
that he took.

The principal photography of the film began in August 2008. The scene in
Ladakh, the climax of the film, if not shot in the first schedule would have had
to be shot after a year as Ladakh is only accessible for a few months a year.
The decision was made to shoot the climax in Ladakh in the first schedule
itself. Do you think it would have affected performances had you people shot
it at the beginning and not a year later which is what you had to do because
of terrible weather?

I was very relieved that we could not shoot the entire climax then even though
it was a terrible experience for the entire team. We shot for a day and then bad
weather hits. It was scary how we evacuated everyone to safety. But all is well that
ends well. Our performances would have suffered because we had not lived those
characters as yet. Especially mine. At least Sharman and Madhavan had shot in
Bengaluru for the first few scenes of the film and, therefore, had forged some sort of
a connect but my first day of shooting for 3 /diots was in Ladakh. I told everyone
that I was very happy because it would certainly have compromised the credibility
we were able to bring in when we shot for it after shooting for the entire film.

You actually drank for your drunken scenes. Method acting?

I actually find it difficult to do drunken scenes without drinking. It helps my
performance if I actually drink and perform. I believe in aides. My goal is to give
my best performance and if anything helps in achieving this, I am happy to use it.
I am not one of those people who shy away from using things that can enhance
their performance and eventually the film.

What do you think is the core of 3 Idiots?

Chase excellence and not success is definitely the core thought. To put it differently,
do what you believe in and what makes you happy. What makes you happy may
not always be conducive to what we commonly understand as success. Farhan
wants to be a wildlife photographer and it may not appear to people that he may

367
be successful doing that even in the conventional way. For this, first one needs
to understand what success is. Doing what makes you happy and doing it well is
success. It may get you less monetary benefits. However, it may also get you good
monetary benefits and one must not discount that. So you may get success in the
conventional way as well by doing what makes you happy but the key is to do what
makes you happy, what is fulfilling to you. That is the core thought of the film.

fl PIA SAHASTRABUDDHE: KAREENA KAPOOR

The first thing I did was to ask Kareena to put on weight. Even when she was shooting
for other films, I would send her messages saying, “Hope you are eating Kareena.” Pia
had to be real and feisty.

— Rajkumar Hirani

I saw her in Omkara and Jab We Met. In my opinion, of all the actresses we have, she
is one of the finest. It was a natural choice to go for a fine actress.

— Vidhu Vinod Chopra

On a crisp November morning in 2003, Kareena Kapoor wangled a day off from her
hectic schedule and headed for Gaiety Galaxy, one of the oldest single-screen cinema
halls in suburban Mumbai, to catch the first show of the latest release that week.

She walked out of the hall mesmerised. A quick call was made to her manager, Zahid,
from the parking lot of the hall enquiring about the man who had directed the film
she had just seen. Zahid gushed: “He is God! He is God! Don’t know his name but
he has directed over 200 advertisements.” He promised to get back with details.

The film Kareena had seen was Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. and its first-time director was
Rajkumar Hirani. His name was immediately scribbled in the wish list of directors
in her diary. Kareena’s mother, Babita, told her to play her Sindhi card with him
if need be: “Just tell him, ‘My mother is Sindhi just like you and, therefore, you

must work with me.’

You had wanted to work with Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan for a long
time. 3 Idiots presented the opportunity to work with both. How did this fall
into place for you?

‘We met at Mukesh Ambani’s party in December 2007. Before I could go and talk to
him, he came up to me and told me how much he liked my work in Jab We Met.

368
Then he said the magic words: “I am doing a film with Aamir and I might have a
role for you.” I jumped and told him that I am game and he does not even have
to narrate it to me. But Raju insisted that I hear it and then let him know how
I feel. He was writing at the time and promised to call the moment he was done.
When a month passed by without a word, I messaged him. This time, he asked me
to wait for a week, and exactly a week later, Raju called and told me that he had
finished and I was called in for a narration. I went for the narration with absolute
certainty that I would do this film. Nothing was going to change my mind. I heard
the script. My first reaction was that this film would create history and I wanted
to be a part of it. I knew that the film belonged to the ‘3 Idiots’ and my role in
terms of screen-time would be small but this would be a ground-breaking film
and only a fool would pass up this opportunity. I have worked in this industry
for nearly a decade and this was the most real and evocative screenplay that I had
ever heard. Also, it was my chance to work with Raju Hirani. The simplicity and
romance in his work are unmatched. He does not have to travel to Paris, New
York, London, San Francisco, or build opulent sets or drape actors in designer wear
to create magic. He plays with the magic of moments, of silence, and of life. He
just moves you and stirs something deep within. I was in and nothing was going
to change my mind.

With Raju, you got Aamir as a bonus. It took a decade for you and Aamir to
come together. Surely there must have been opportunities before this?

There had been opportunities before this but nothing worked out. I was supposed
to do Ghajini but when Murgadoss approached me for Ghajini, I had already signed
Mani Ratnam’s Lajjo with Aamir. Aamir called me and said that he could not do
two back-to-back films with me. I opted out of Ghajini and stayed with Lajjo.
Unfortunately, Lajjo was shelved. Vishal Bharadwaj was also supposed to do a project
with us. Aamir and he had creative differences over the script so that got scrapped
as well. Basically, every project we were supposed to do didn’t happen. I would often
bump into Aamir and complain. He kept assuring me and promised that he would
give me one of the best films of his career. And today that has happened. It almost
feels like a dream. I am in 3 /diots and it is Aamir Khan’s best film ever. He is very
lucky for the Kapoor sisters. Both, Karisma and I have given super blockbusters with
him. I keep teasing Aamir: “You do one film in three years so I don’t know when
another heroine will get a chance to work with you. It will probably be my niece

Samaira (laughs).” Aamir is truly a genius. He is a gift to work with.

369
Pia is very different from the roles you have done so far. What was your
approach to Pia?

Pia is real. She is spontaneous and outspoken. I have received more accolades for Pia
than I did for Geet from Jab We Met. Geet was euphoric, mad, and larger than
life. Every girl wanted to be like Geet but Pia’s USP is that she is every girl. She
touches a cord across all age groups. I was shooting Kurbaan around the same time
as I was shooting for 3 Idiots. Kurbaan was such an intense role. 3 Idiots, on the
other hand, is very real and these are roles much tougher to play because then a
heroine has to break away from her identity and image and reveal a part of herself.
This is where Raju’s brilliance comes in. On the sets of the film, I became Pia and
that’s what everybody saw. Kareena vanished for the time that I was shooting for
3 Idiots. And Pia has made such an impact that it has left me speechless. I knew
this would happen and that is why the length of my role was immaterial. No one
ever thought of me as Kareena here. Though I was the only actor in the film who
was doing multiple projects at the time, I gave priority to 3 Idiots as it was the
first film I was doing with Raju, Vinod, and Aamir.

At the time of the narration, I am sure, you must have looked forward to the
confrontation between Pia and her father (Virus). That is the one scene that
belonged to you. Was that a part of the extensive rehearsals that were held
before the principal photography for the film began?

This ia my favourite scene in the film. When I heard this scene, I knew that this
would be my big opportunity and the centrepiece of my performance. I was determined
to nail it. I had come fully prepared for it. Raju was very keen that I rehearse this
scene. I am a spontaneous actress and too much rehearsing does not help me. Raju
listened to me which was very nice of him. I requested him to just roll the camera.
I felt that the entire scene was set up in such a way that the only way to approach
it was to be spontaneous. The scene begins with Pia clearing the table and you can
feel by the way she is putting away the plates and the spoons that she is going to
explode. This was done in a single take. I don’t know what got into me but I did
not use glycerin. The moment I finished the shot, I expected to hear some kind of
a sound but there was complete silence on the floor. I panicked and thought I had
messed up the scene. Raju removed the headphones. He had tears in his eyes and
the entire crew gave me a thunderous applause. I was preparing for this scene for a
while and I knew if I did not get this right, then there would be trouble.

370
You did a drunken scene on screen for the first time in your career in 3 Idiots?
What was that experience like?

Raju was really worried about this scene. I have never ever done a drunken scene
and I am a teetotaler. This stretched on for fifteen to twenty takes. Drunken
scenes are not easy to do. It is very tough to get the consistency of drunkness
and the slurs have to be the same. To make the job at hand tougher, this was a
sync-sound film. Aamir helped me a lot in that scene. He told me to look at the
centre of my forehead so that my eyes look a little crossed. Raju even told me that
I could drink if that helped me perform. These boys had done a drunken scene
earlier and they had actually got drunk for it. Aamir kept on telling me to have a
glass of wine. I told them that this route would not work for me because if I had
any alcohol I would just fall asleep instantly.

There were so many takes we did. Finally, Raju asked us to wrap up. I think he
was fed up. He said he would manage something in the edit. I was feeling terrible
thinking maybe I could not deliver as per expectations. But then the film released
and people went wild about the dhokla-fafada scene. Fans messaged me dialogues
from the scene and I went crazy with the kind of response I got. Raju was aghast
because he had used a ‘No-Good’ take. Normally, actresses in Hindi films don't
get the opportunity to do a drunken scene and when they do, it is a tough one to
nail. I am happy that people gave me such an overwhelming response to my first
drunken scene.

Saif has worked with Vinod Chopra Films in Parineeta and Eklavya. He knows
everyone well. Any advice he offered before you took on the film?

During the making of Ek/avya, Raju had spoken to Saif about 3 Jdiors but at that
time he was still writing. Shahrukh Khan stepped in later but then eventually
Aamir did the film. These changes are common in the industry as things keep
changing according to how the script pans out. Maybe 3 /diots was not meant to
be for Saif but he was so happy when he got to know that I was going to be in
it. He was constantly on the sets with me and he saw the film in the office before
the first print was out. He was completely floored by it. He kept saying, “What
have they made? How are we ever going to surpass this? What have they done?
Everything will now fall short of 3 /diots.” Even though he had just given a huge
hit — Love Aajkal — the same year, he is one actor who was genuinely happy for
our team. He is very close to Vinod, Raju, and Aamir, and was there throughout
the making of the film. He is as much a part of the 3 Idiots team as I am.

371
Hf VIRU SAHASTRABUDDHE: BOMAN IRANI

Boman has to be a part of all my films. After school and college, it is difficult to make
lifelong friends. Boman is one such friend I have made. He was the only actor I wanted
for this role and he did not have a choice but to agree to play Virus. He is a friend
and I can completely take advantage of that friendship.

— Rajkumar Hirani

Raju and your relationship organically developed into one that went beyond
films. Your interaction on a film is not restricted to just discussing the character
you are playing. You are an integral part of his ideas team and long discussions
revolving around the script between you and him are an essential part of Raju’s
creative process. What was your reaction to the idea and the script of 3 Idiots
the first time you heard it?

Raju told me about buying the rights to Five Point Someone when we were in Leeds
for IIFA (2007). Raju was there to pick up the best director award for Lage Raho.
I was very surprised that Raju had bought the rights for this book because my first
reaction to it was: “What are you going to do with the book? The novel in itself does
not seem like material for a film.” Raju told me that he and Abhijat were working
on the screenplay. A few months later when Raju and I were on a flight to Nagpur,
he narrated the script to me and I loved it. I had my concerns which we discussed
over several subsequent sessions but what they had done with it was fantastic.

You were reluctant to play Virus because you thought it would be in broad
strokes a repeat of Asthana from M.B.B.S. Why were you apprehensive about
Virus and what convinced you?

I was offered this role even by the guy who was planning to make Five Point Someone
earlier but he could not get the project off the ground. The first time I heard the
character, I felt Irfan Khan would be very interesting in this role. For me, this
seemed a lot like Asthana from M.B.B.S. though Raju kept telling me that it is
different. Eventually, I realised that I didn’t have a choice. I would have to do this.
T couldn't say no to Raju. Once that was settled, Raju and I got down to working
on the character, fleshing it out and giving it body.

A lot of people felt that Virus was more a caricature than a character. What
do you feel about that?

372
Virus comes across as a caricature because, with all due respect, our teachers who
have been teaching for many years do become somewhat caricatures of themselves.
I fed on that. I played that up and that is why he seems caricature-ish. Raju
and I travelled to Pune for a weekend. While writing 3 Jdiots, they had hired a
farmhouse there which was used for writing sessions. For two days we sat and
worked out Virus.

I wanted this man to be special. I thought of him as dark and edgy with cussedness
being the underlying trait more than anything else. The tone is of sarcasm. He
has a mean streak. Then we started padding him up with quirks to embellish his
character. The idea was also to take Virus away from Asthana as much as possible.
We gave Virus this unruly dense crop of hair on his head. Instead of suits he
wore these ill-fitting clothes belonging to another generation. I borrowed a lot
from people I know in real life. Interestingly, Virus’s daily ritual of the power
nap whilst listening to opera and getting his shave done is drawn from Mahatma
Gandhi's life. He didn’t listen to opera but he was a very busy man. He had told
his staff to cut his nails and shave him whilst he took a nap. This way he saved
time. This was our reference point for the quirk we added to Virus’s character.
Then I wanted him to lisp. For that I had to rehearse for months because if it
did not look natural, it could go very wrong. Another of my favourites was that
Virus has to be ambidextrous. I had called up Abhijat and Raju in America to
discuss this with them. They loved it. Being ambidextrous is a mark of genius and
my perception of Virus was that he is a genius. He is not an ordinary guy but
he has chosen to devote his life to numbers instead of applying himself to greater
pursuits. The only thing that we changed was his body language. Earlier, I thought
that it might be interesting to have a man who constantly speaks about life being
a race and his every habit is geared towards saving time, being laborious and slow
in his own movements. He walks and moves slowly, but during the rehearsals this
did not work at all so we changed it. All this really helped in uplifting Virus as
a character.

This is your first film with Aamir Khan. He is the protaganist and you are the
antagonist so to speak in 3 Idiots. What was the experience like?

This script was narrated to everyone from Hrithik to Shahrukh. I have no idea
why Aamir was not considered but eventually he is the one who did it and was
a perfect fit for the role. He is amazing to work with in all respects — calibre,

373
commitment, courtesy. The experience of working with him is special. The defining
thing about Aamir is that, the equation is not of two co-stars working together but
of two colleagues, two collaborators. No one is working at cross purposes. All of
us become a team and our goal — the film.

During the interviews, everyone told me that Raju pampers you more than
anyone else on the sets? Is that true?

Who told you that? Tell me? (laughing) Were Sharman, Raju, and Aamir joking
about this? I am sure they were. This is just what everyone says. He pampers
everyone. No special favours extended to me.

Hf RAJU RASTOGI: SHARMAN JOSHI

Sharman was on my radar since the time my wife, Manjeet, and I had seen his work
in Style. We had both really liked him and I wanted to work with him whenever the
right role came along.

— Rajkumar Hirani

Sharman Joshi would have frequented the theatres more had he known that
movie watching would reap such rich benefits. In early 2007, Sharman got out
of Globus, a theatre in Bandra (Mumbai) and noticed Raju Hirani with his
team in the compound of the cinema hall. Sharman had always wanted to work
with Raju. Though tempted to walk up to him and introduce himself, Sharman
hesitated thinking that this might not be the right place to approach him. But he
was pleasantly surprised when on spotting him, Raju smiled and waved at him.
Confidence boosted, Sharman walked up to him.

But bigger surprises were in store for Sharman that night. Raju told him that he
had a role for him but since he was still in the process of writing, he would get
in touch with him soon.

Sharman went home in a daze.
How did 3 Idiots come together for you? I believe that the restrooms at various
multiplexes have played an important role?

(Smiles) The first time Raju Sir told me he had a role for me was at a chance
meeting in the compound of a cinema hall. Though I did not get a call from him
for a few months, after that I knew that the offer was for real. The very first time

374
you meet Raju Sir, you can feel the honesty and sincerity. He is not the fi/mi lingo
sweet-talking types. So I was assured in my mind that something would come out
of our meeting. But as luck would have it, we bumped into each other once again
at a multiplex (PVR in Juhu). We met in the restroom after the film was over. We
stood there chatting for 15 minutes. Again, a few months passed by. Uncannily, we
bumped into each other in the restroom of the same multiplex yet again but this
time during the interval. Raju and I joked that slowly we were inching towards the
beginning of the film. Three chance meetings at cinema halls are rather weird.

Finally, we connected and I went and met him at his office. The first meeting was
supposed to be a casual one but I think Raju was so excited and happy that he
narrated the entire script to me. This would be approximately six months after our
first meeting in the compound of a cinema hall.

Shahrukh was doing the film at the time when I was signed on. Then there was
an eight-month break where Shahrukh was not doing the film and eventually
Aamir came in. Once Aamir came in, I was constantly in touch with Raju but
during the in-between period, I did not bother him at all. That’s how this whole
thing happened.

What was your first reaction to the script?

I loved the script and even though they still had to make the final decision about
me, I went out that night and celebrated. I didn’t even know which character I
would play — Farhan or Raju — if I was doing the film. I honestly loved both
characters so it would not have mattered to me which one I would play. Initially,
Shahrukh was playing Rancho but later Aamir came in, and once he did, I auditioned
for both the parts. I had read Five Point Someone so for the first script narration
I had come with some pre-conceived notions about the different roles in the film.
For example, in the book, Alok’s character is rather weak. I was a little worried
about that. But once the script was narrated to me, the character was completely
different and was not weak. By the time Aamir was finalised, formal meetings
happened, script narrations started, and then the auditions. I was comfortable
playing either part because I felt both had a lot of scope for an actor in terms of
meat and challenge. What is beautiful about working with Raju is that for every
little change, Raju involves everyone. His humility is on a different level and he
truly and honestly respects every individual. I was pleasantly surprised that Raju
gave me a pen and pad and asked me to jot down what I felt about the film and

375
if I had any inputs, these could be discussed. He likes participation, and, most
importantly, that participation is truly appreciated.

I auditioned for the role with the scene in the Director's office after we were
caught gate-crashing his daughter Mona’s wedding. It is the one with “Sir aapki
per plate cost kya thi”. At that time, Madhavan was not there so I had auditioned
with another actor.

I was drawn to the script because it is about finding yourself. The scenes where
Farhan confronts his father and his job interview are the core of the film. I loved
the human element in the film and the journey of these two friends who find
themselves through various experiences.

You said that you auditioned for both Raju and Farhan? Did you seriously
like both the roles equally?

Raju Sir being Raju Sir gave me the option of auditioning for whichever role
I wanted to play. This he did in the first meeting itself. Like I said, I had gone
there with pre-conceived notions so I had my apprehensions. I told him what
I felt about Alok’s character. He just smiled and narrated the script to me. After
the narration, he asked me the same question. My answer this time round was
whichever one he would like me to audition for. I had understood that both the
characters were solid. He made me audition for Raju. Then, after a few weeks, he
made me audition for Farhan.

Eventually, he made me play Raju’s character. Frankly, this film is so well etched out
that I really didn’t have to do much. This script is remarkable and equally remarkable
is the way it has been executed. For an actor, half the job was already done.

Before the first schedule began, I read the script many times over. I knew the
progression of the entire script from any given point in time. The script was
the Bible, therefore, whichever scene we shot for, I played the script back in my
head, followed the progression and performed it accordingly. My lifelines on the
set were the script, Raju Sir, and my instincts.

For all the drunken scenes in the film, I believe you people actually got drunk.
‘What was that experience like?

We had a blast shooting the water tank scene and the one after that at the Director's
house. It was so much fun. The night at the water tank went a little out of hand.

376
We gave lengthy takes. The production team finally asked us to get on with it as
they were running out of stock though I don’t think that was the case. I think they
just wanted us to pack up (laughs). The night after that, we were at the Director's
house. Vinod Chopra was with us that night so he also drank with us in Aamir’s
trailer. After a few drinks, he said: “Koi bhi bahar ka dekhega to kahega ke kaisa
producer hai, khud bhi pee raha hai aur apne actors ko bhi pila raha hai. Shooting late
ho gayi to kya hoga?” (If anyone from outside the unit were to see us like this, he
would wonder what kind of a producer I am — not only am I drinking but I am
also making my actors drink. What will happen if the shooting gets delayed?)

Not by design but by chance, Aamir, Madhavan, and you were finalised as
the ‘3 Idiots’ and you had worked with each other before in Rang de Basanti.
What was it like on the sets?

I was ecstatic when Aamir came in. We already had an equation. I knew how fabulous
life was going to be on the sets and that made me very happy. Then I discovered
Raju Sir on the sets and he was a pleasure as well. I was not sure how Raju Sir
would be on the sets. I think he was a bit paranoid in the first schedule. There
was a lot of responsibility and pressure on him. He needed to be extra careful.
I started to feel the pressure too. It was a Raju Hirani film with Aamir Khan and,
predictably, there were a lot of expectations. I could feel and realise how important
it was for Raju Sir to set the right tone on the sets from the beginning. Once that
was done, Raju Sir transformed and everything lightened up. There was a comfort
factor with Aamir and Maddy. Also, Raju Sir really pampers his actors. I used to
tease him about pampering Boman more and Boman would protest wildly. There
is a complete sense of freedom with Raju Sir. You are allowed to perform a scene
whichever way you want to and try options if you feel they might lend something
to the scene. He is very caring towards every individual on the set and this is what
transfers onto the screen.

Hf FARHAN QURESHI: MADHAVAN

Madhavan came in because we were looking for a competent actor to play Farhan.
I had my doubts about Madhavan only because of his weight, which he promised me
he would shed but I caught him eating kulfi once. After the kulfi, the confidence dipped
even lower but then I was pleasantly surprised with his competence and he has done
exceedingly well.

— Vidhu Vinod Chopra

377
He watched Secret, the screen adaptation of Rhonda Byrne’s eponymous bestselling
book. Amongst other things, Secret talks about quantifying desires by putting them
down on paper. He did just that and wrote down the names of all the directors he
wanted to work with. Raju Hirani’s name topped the list.

Three weeks later he received a message from Raju Hirani.

The next day, Madhavan boarded a flight to Mumbai.

You were approached for Munna Bhai at the time Raju was thinking of making
it as a television series. What was the meeting like?

I don’t remember meeting Raju for the television series. I was approached and we
had met but I have no recollection of the meeting. It was only when Munna Bhai
M.B.B.S. released that I came to know that it was this particular film that Raju
had wanted to make for television for which he had approached me.

I remember seeing Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. and saying where had this guy been
hiding all this while. It is a sign of greatness to be able to say so many things in
the simplest manner. He struck me as a filmmaker and not merely as a director.
I desperately wanted to get in touch with him. I remember gushing and raving in
the message I sent him after watching the film. He immediately called me back
and told me that he likes my work immensely.

‘We met sporadically after that at award functions and social gatherings. I had even
approached Raju to write the screenplay of Ramji Londonwale because I thought it
was a subject that might appeal to him. He was busy with Lage Raho at the time
but he was kind enough to suggest Abbas Tyrewala for it. Abbas was also caught
up with his own film. Eventually, Sanjay Dayma wrote the film. But I knew the
moment I met Raju that our connection was for keeps.

How did 3 Idiots happen? Your belief is that the process started with you
watching the film Secret. What happened when you got the phone call?

Sarita, my wife, had been telling me to get in touch with Raju. She had heard that
he was making a film that revolved around three engineering students. I reasoned
with her that films don’t get made that way. If Raju had not already considered me
for a role, it wouldn't be right for me and I did not want to put him in a spot
by calling him. When I got the message from him, Sarita and I sat staring at it in
stunned silence. I don’t know how much this has to do with Secret but this was such

378
an amazing coincidence. The message was simple: “Maddy, I need to speak with you.”
Even before calling him back, I told Sarita that I was doing a film with Raju.

Then I called up Raju and he politely asked me to meet him whenever I was in
Mumbai next. I told him, “I am coming tomorrow.” I remember going to his office
and meeting him. He narrated the script to me which made me laugh and cry at
the same time.

I immediately offered to give him a screen test. He was aghast but I insisted. I picked
out two scenes from the script. One of them was eventually not in the film. This
is the scene where one of the puppies I have grown fond of in the hostel dies and
I get drunk and react. The other scene was the scene with my father in the film
where I tell him that I don’t want to pursue engineering. Raju was not going to take
a decision right then even though I could see that he was convinced. He said that
he would let me know. I did not hear from him for two weeks. Then I received a
mail from him saying that Vinod Chopra would call me. This was somewhere in
April 2008 and we were supposed to shoot in August. After waiting for some more
time, I called Raju and asked him if I could give my dates away as I had not heard
from them and my other producers were waiting. Raju was shocked to hear this
and said that I absolutely couldn't give away my dates because we were shooting
in July. Apparently there was some confusion and I had not been informed. Then
Vinod called and things were finalised.

Did you audition for both the roles or was it always Farhan?

Farhan was the only role I related to when I heard the script. I think even Raju had
only Farhan in mind as far as I was concerned. When Raju narrated the script to me,
I knew that every student and every father in the country would relate to Farhan.
If I was able to pull this role off, then that would be my biggest achievement.

What were your first reactions to the script?

The best part about Raju is that he encourages us to think like the characters we
are to play. Our feedback is considered and taken very seriously. As an example,
for a long time, I felt that I did not have enough of a trigger to go confront my
father. Initially, the letter to Andre Istevan was not there in the script. I spoke to
Raju several times about this. Two or three weeks later, Raju told me about the
idea of the letter to Andre Istevan that Farhan never posted, and that became
the trigger. I did not even know that Raju had taken my apprehension seriously

379
and had been working on it. Raju came up with this idea and then he and Abhijat
planted the fact that I am an animal lover with a natural talent and interest in

wildlife photography.

The film started its principal photography with your scene in the airplane.
‘What was your approach to Farhan as he is also the narrator of the film?

The first transformation you see on screen is in Farhan. So there was the additional
challenge of making that believable. If the audience did not find me convincing,
then it would set the wrong tone for the film. I set about working on my look first.
Also as a character, I go through maximum transformation. Raju’s transformation
happens in college after his suicide attempt. He loses his fears and there is a complete
change in his attitude evident in the interview scene but Farhan’s transformation
in terms of his personality was to happen once he left college. There had to be a
marked difference between the Farhan the audience would see in the first scene
and the one they would see in college. I gave myself a darker, leaner, and rugged
look for the portions in the present. I am a wildlife photographer and, therefore,
spend time in the sun, wear those jackets with many pockets to hold things that
come in handy on a shoot and name an edgier personality. There is an aggressive
dimension to Farhan, the wildlife photographer. But as an engineering student, he
is mild and innocent. I went completely clean shaven, chubby cheeked with round
boyish glasses. It took us a very long time to zero in on the glasses, I remember.
So, I worked on the look as well as the personality to make sure that the journey
of the character is evident and real.

Hf CHATUR RAMALINGAM: OMI VAIDYA

We took a huge gamble by casting Omi. He has a long and important role in the film
and we were casting someone for it who did not know Hindi at all. It was a huge
chance we took which paid off eventually. Omi is a great find. He brought credibility

and believability to Chatur’ character which was critical for it to work.

— Rajkumar Hirani

His feet were killing him. The entire day he had spent running from pillar to post
taking care of proceedings at a grand Marathi event that he had organised in Los
Angeles. A lot of people from the Marathi community in America had flown in to
attend the event. Finally, the night was winding down and it was time to let go
and have some fun. He hit the dance floor and inadvertently started dancing with

380
a girl. She was a screenwriter from Michigan and he, a working actor and film
director. They exchanged numbers.

Four years later, the actor-director while on a visit to India to find possible buyers
for his film, got a call from her — out of the blue. Supriya Kelkar, the screenwriter
from Michigan was now working with Vinod Chopra on Broken Horses and wanted
to give Omi Vaidya a heads-up on a possible role in their production 3 Idiots.

Omi Vaidya might never have bagged this career-altering role were it not for that
random dance four years ago at a Marathi night in Los Angeles.

You have lived in America all your life and are a working actor in LA. Was
Hindi Cinema on your agenda?

Both my parents were very supportive of my choice to pursue acting, otherwise
it would have been very difficult to do this. Most Indians settled abroad might
not have managed to do what I did. I had my family backing me and that is
the reason it was possible. My mother had wanted to become an actress but she
could never pursue that desire so she made sure that at least I could follow my
dreams. Therefore, I did not have to worry about things like rent and food after
college and was able to concentrate only on acting. Bollywood, strangely, was never
on the radar nor was the sensibility preferred or familiar. I did not know much
about Bollywood films. I had seen some of Aamir Khan's films. But three-hour-
long films with all the dancing made little sense to me and the sensibility did not
hold much appeal for me either. I had seen a bit of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. but
nothing of Lage Raho. All of this, I later realised, was actually a boon. It was an
asset to have little knowledge of Bollywood. It helped me when I was shooting
with the top-of-the-line actors like Aamir Khan in 3 Jdots. 1 was not weighed
down by the awe of shooting with the biggest star in Bollywood. I could perform
without being hampered.

How did 3 Idiots happen and what drew you to the material despite no prior
plans or inclination to be part of Hindi Cinema?

When I got a call from Supriya, I sent my showreel across and Raju liked it because
he felt that I was very boyish and, most importantly, I was not from India. Initially,
I was very sceptical. I informed them that I didn’t speak the language at all so
how would this be feasible. The people scheduled to audition me just refused to
listen assuming that I would at least have some knowledge of the language because

381
everybody who says they don’t know the language, do know a little bit. Little did
they know that I really did not know the language at all.

I was auditioned on Raju Rastogi’s lines from the film and I was terrible. I spent
some three hours in the office reading the material. During the screen test, 30 seconds
after I started saying the lines, the casting director started correcting me and a
minute into the audition, she asked me to stop. I was politely thanked so I knew
that they had not been impressed but then I had gone in knowing that I would
fail, What worked in my favour was that Raju came into the office while I was
meeting his team. He had some work there so I ran into him. We got to chat a
bit and therefore a personal connection was established.

A few days later, I received a call from the team asking me to come in again. And
this time, they said that they would send me a script for the audition. They sent me
a portion from Munna Bhai. The brief was that I would have to learn the lines and
not speak them. I was not to worry about speaking Hindi correctly: the character
was an NRI though he had not been fully fleshed out as yet but I was just to do
what Omi would do. I felt much more comfortable with this. The way I did it was
that even though I knew what I was saying, I did it like I did not because Omi
would not know what he was saying. So I did gestures that were absolutely not in
syne with what I was saying. They liked this a lot. After this test, the brief for the
character expanded a little bit. I was told that the character is a top honcho of a
corporate concern, always in a suit with a whole lot of expensive and fancy stuff.
He has come back to India to prove a point to these guys who used to make fun
of him. This was what I was given to play with. I was asked again not to worry
about the Hindi. If I so wanted, then I could do it all in English. So I did this
test even better. I smoked a ciggarette and did my thing. All the Hindi words that
I knew were the bad words so I sprinkled what I was saying with that. My mother
was there with me so she was a bit shocked.

I did the audition well but I was quite sure that I was not right for the role because I
did not speak the language at all. I went back to LA after this test and did not
hear from the 3 /diots team for a month. In LA, if you don’t get a call for a week
after an audition, it can be safely assumed that you didn’t get the job.

But a month later, I got a call from the production team and this time I was told
that I would be auditioning with scenes from 3 Idiots. I knew then that I was in
the race and, therefore, being seriously considered. Then I started studying the text.
They gave me the now famous balatkar speech scene. The other scene they gave

382
me was the water tank scene where I lose my temper and the bet between Rancho
and Chatur is made. I could see that they wanted to gauge whether I could do
both comedy and drama. The Broken Horses team was in New Mexico so I flew
to New Mexico and did the audition. I gave it my best shot. I gave up a role to
make it for this audition and I don’t regret my decision. Again, I did not get a
call from the team for another month. Then Raju called me himself and told me
that though I had done a great job someone had taught me how to speak those
lines. He was right because my mom had taught me. He told me to stop learning
Hindi as this character would know very little Hindi. They were writing him like
that, therefore, if I wanted the role, I would have to stop learning Hindi and stop
watching Hindi movies. He did not want my interpretation of the character and
performance to be affected by such factors.

Things work differently here than in the West. Did you have any apprehensions
about being away from the Hollywood scene for the considerable duration
3 Idiots demanded you to be away?

I had my doubts because I was giving up six months of my life and not being paid
much according to Hollywood standards. I worried about whether this was the right
choice or not. But the very reason I chose this as my preferred field of work was
because I wanted to be able to do new, fun, and exciting things. This would offer
all the things I looked for in a job. It was a new system and sensibility I would
be operating in. Therefore, I wanted to do this and it was my choice. Also Raju’s
sincerity and personal emails to me convinced me that I would be taken care of.
Once I came down here and saw the level of professional courtesy I was extended,
the sincerity and the seriousness, I knew I had taken the right decision.

What were your first reactions to the script?

That it is a very long one (laughs). There were lots of pages. I read through it
but I kept my focus on Chatur. I had not thought of the film as a whole. I only
focussed on my character. When I saw the full film, that is when I realised what
the whole film was all about. I really just kept my mind on Chatur. Also my lack
of knowledge of the language kept me from understanding a lot of things.

You were already dealing with language issues. I am sure there were portions

in the film that were more challenging than others. Tell us a little about those
tough ones you had to get your head around?

383
It has to be the scene on the water tank where I am angry and drunk. I am a
happy person and emotions like anger and jealousy do not come easily to me.
Before performing this scene, I had to separate myself from everyone to be able
to do a good job. The anger and depression had to be worked on. I had a three-
day break before we were to shoot this scene. I requested Raju to let me leave the
production for those three days and to just put me up in a small room or club
or hotel somewhere away from everyone. Raju agreed and I isolated myself. When
I reached the set three days later, I kept to myself and let the isolation gnaw at me.
Raju loved my work in that scene. It took me another three days after the scene
to come out of the state I had driven myself into though.

‘What was the experience like for you since this is your first brush with Hindi
Cinema?

The whole experience was very different from America. It was very interesting.
I really wanted to do this and I am glad I did. This was primarily because I knew
that Raju wanted me and it is very rare and different from America where whether
the director wants you or does not want you does not matter because the corporate
guys make the decision. Here, the director really liked me and wanted me and
we had developed a personal connection. Systems-wise, things were completely
different from the West. Here make-up and costume trials were done in your hotel
room which was a little odd. I got the script five days before we began shooting.
Though it took some getting used to, all of this had its own flavour. Also, I am
not from here so I don’t really have hang ups about chatting and mixing around
with the drivers and kitchen staff. So I could absorb a lot and get in touch with
the ground realities a lot better as I chatted with these people. These guys have
the most interesting stories. The others are more politically correct and talk about
show business all the time. The biggest perk of the role was that I was playing a fat
balding guy in major chunks of the film for which I had to put on weight. I put
on twelve kilograms and had a lot of fun doing that because I could eat whatever
I wanted and did not have to exercise.

A WorD OF THANKS

Within a span of 10 months — between August 2009 and June 2010 — Om Books
International has published the original screenplays of two unparalleled blockbusters of
Hindi cinema — Lage Raho Munna Bhai and now 3 Idiots — directed by Rajkumar
Hirani and produced by Vinod Chopra Films. This would not have been possible
without the trust and faith Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Anupama Chopra, Rajkumar
Hirani and Abhijat Joshi reposed in Om Books International. For this, not only
am I grateful to all of them, I am humbled as well.

Smriti Kiran conceptualised and compiled 3 Idiots: The Original Screenplay. 1 thank
her for her efforts.

I thank Shraboni Roy, our graphic designer, Sangita Koushik, our editor, Sanjay
Gupta and Raj John, for their support.

And last, but not least, I would like to thank Dipa Chaudhuri for not losing sight
of our common goal till the very end. Without her inputs and patience, this book
would have fallen short of the expectations of those who wrote the original screenplay
of 3 Idiots and turned it into a landmark film and a modern classic.

— Ajay Mago

SMRITI KIRAN covered entertainment, particularly the Hindi film industry for over 11 years as a journalist and
television producer at NDTV, before joining the industry at Vinod Chopra Films where she worked on a film
under development, and briefly on 3 Idiots.

Her Twitter profile (smritikiran) describes her as a cinema junkie, freelance television producer and journalist,
writer, aspiring filmmaker, voracious reader and coffee addict. Her husband agrees with the coffee addict part.
In between reading primarily Indian authors and poring over Hindi film scripts, she works on her own script
which she hopes to direct into a film one dai

 

Apart from following her dreams and continuing to learn from the best in the business, she leads the screenplays
division at Vinod Chopra Films, a venture which aims to bring screenplays of the greatest Indian classics and
more recent films which contribute to the dynamism of Indian cinema, to cinema buffs and readers across
the world.
