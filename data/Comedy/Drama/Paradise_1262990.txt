LAMB OF GOD

Written by

Diablo Cody
MUSIC UP: A CHEESY, SYNTH-HEAVY BALLAD

EXT. MANNERHEIM HOUSE (TO ESTABLISH) - MORNING

A “Tuscan"-style tract house in a remote, snow-covered field.
The house looks very out of place, probably because this
isn’t Tuscany. A deer grazes nearby.

There’s a plastic “life-size” NATIVITY SCENE in the yard. The
BABY JESUS is discreetly tethered to the manger with a bike
lock. Theft prevention.

CUT TO:

A POOR-QUALITY VIDEO TAKEN AT A TALENT SHOW.

LAMB MANNERHEIM, 17, grips a microphone and paces the stage.
Lamb is pretty, but in an extremely modest, wholesome way.
Her clothes are dated, and she wears her long hair in an old-
fashioned style. Think Walmart meets Little House on the
Prairie.

A homemade American Idol-inspired banner on the stage reads:
“Christ is OUR Idol! Youth Talent Night 2007.”

Lamb takes this performance very seriously, even if it’s just
for friends and family. She holds the mic like a pro, fanning
her fingers and using moves she’s learned from TV. She smiles
and begins to sing in an unsteady, nervous voice.

The song is “Place in This World,” a Christian anthem by
Michael W. Smith.

LAMB (2007)
The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled

INT. MANNERHEIM HOUSE (LAMB’S BEDROOM) - MORNING

We pan past a wall of family photos and mass-produced
Christian art. A sticker that says “Real Women Eat Meat.” A
MONTANA BIBLE COLLEGE pennant. A cross.

Lamb, now 21, is lying in bed. Faintly, as if underwater, we
hear the singing performance playing in another room.

LAMB (2007)

A heart that's hopeful

A head that's full of dreams
(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 2.

LAMB (2007) (CONT'D)
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems

Lamb rolls over stiffly. We see her arms, covered with FLESH-
TONED COMPRESSION GARMENTS-- they’re like Ace bandages
crossed with fingerless gloves.

Lamb sits up, slowly and with effort. She’s a pretty young
woman. But her shoulders and neck are marred by PINK SCAR
TISSUE. The scars could be covered with the right clothing,
but right now, every flaw is exposed.

She winces in pain. Every day begins with pain.

LAMB (CONT'D)
ow.

We INTERCUT with the video, which we can now deduce is
playing in another room of the house.

LAMB (2007) (CONT'D)
I'm looking for a reason
Roamin' through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Lamb groans, stiffly swinging her legs out of bed. She
wiggles her toes and reaches for a prescription PILL BOTTLE,
close at hand.

Lamb dry-swallows four Vicodin pills in rapid succession--
she’s a pro at this.

We see that there’s a cup of HOT CHOCOLATE waiting for her on
the bed table. A CANDY CANE and some MINI-MARSHMALLOWS
dissolve in the cocoa. Lamb moves the cup, revealing that the
napkin/coaster bears a handwritten message: “You R Still
Pretty!!! XOxO Mom."

Lamb wrinkles her nose at the cocoa.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Ugh.

Lamb exits the room and follows the sound of the talent show
video to its source.
INT. MANNERHEIM HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - SAME

The living room is bedecked with religious Christmas items.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 3.

MELANIE and DOUG MANNERHEIM, Lamb’s surprisingly young
parents, are watching the talent show video on a gigantic
plasma TV.

MELANIE is an attractive woman with flowing curls and a
sparkling bejeweled cross necklace.

DOUG has spiky hair and a fitted button-down shirt with Ed
Hardy-esque embroidery on it.

As they watch the video, Melanie provides rapid-fire
commentary:

MELANIE
This part I thought she did
so well. You know that thing she
does where she kind of takes off
and makes it her own? That’s called
a “run.”

Doug has watched this many times before.

DOUG
I know.

MELANIE
Lamb could have gotten a talent
agent. I should have taken her to
that open call in Missoula.

DOUG
That was a a long time ago.

Lamb's annoyed voice interrupts.

LAMB
Mom, you’re watching this again?

Lamb has appeared in the living room entry, looking
disheveled and vulnerable with her scars and compression
garments on rare display.

Melanie reacts as though she’s been caught watching porn.

MELANIE
(startled)
Oh! Lamb. You’re up early. Doug,
where’s the clicker?

She roots around for the remote control. Finds a couple of
them in the couch. Flings them aside.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
The small clicker...
DOUG
‘Morning, Lamb.

MELANIE
Do you want your robe?

The Mannerheim household is a modest one, and Melanie isn’t
comfortable looking at Lamb uncovered. She tries to turn off
the tape, but only succeeds in TURNING UP THE VOLUME. Lamb
shouts over the song.

LAMB
I asked you not to watch this
anymore. I even hid the tape in
Dad’s gun safe.

Doug looks at Melanie. She sighs.

MELANIE
We all know the combination is the
dog's birthday.

On the TV: a young, stunning Lamb sings: My place in this
world. My place in this world. Lamb stares numbly at her
former self on the giant screen as Doug turns down the
volume.

MELANIE (CONT’D)
Let’s get your robe. You must
be freezing.

LAMB
I’m a burn victim. I’m always
freezing. Read the pamphlets again.

An awkward silence.
DOUG

Hey, did you see Mom made you a
Candy Cane Cocoa?

MELANIE
I even put some midget marshmallows
in there.
(to Doug)

Is it okay to say “midget” if it’s
about a confection?

DOUG
I'd say little. Mini.

Lamb interrupts angrily. She gestures to the TV, where her
younger self still sings.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 5.

LAMB
Why the-- why the hell are you
doing this to me?

Both parents pause, surprised by her language. Lamb has never
uttered the word “hell” in her life. (At least not in this
context.)

DOUG
Lamb!

LAMB
This is bull.

Now Doug and Melanie are shocked.

DOUG
That’s enough cursing.
MELANIE
(to Doug)

Maybe she didn’t take her
medication yet. She has so much
pain in the morning.

LAMB
I took it, Mom. I took four.

MELANIE
You mean you took one...

LAMB
Times four.

MELANIE
Lamb, you’re supposed to be
tapering off the pills.

LAMB

Well, Mom, you’re supposed to be
“tapering off” the scrapbooks and
photo albums and talent show videos
from back when I didn’t look like
Frankenstein. Now turn it off.

(hesitating)
Damn it!

Melanie shuts off the TV and stares at her daughter. Cursing
is one thing. Taking the Lord’s name in vain is another
entirely.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 6.

MELANIE
Lamb Grace Mannerheim. Did you just
say the worst curse in my Tuscan
mini-mansion?

DOUG
Frankenstein was the doctor, not
the monster. You’re an English
major, honey. You should know that.

LAMB
I was an English major.

DOUG
You're still technically enrolled.

LAMB
You might say I’m burned out on
college, Dad. Get it? Ha ha.

MELANIE
You were doing so good. What’s
gotten into you lately?

DOUG
(to Melanie)
Could be the Devil.

MELANIE
(whispering)
Duh. Obviously.

Lamb gives up, her shoulders sagging in defeat.

LAMB
I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I’m
just not feeling well today. Got my
monthly bill.

DOUG
What bill?

Lamb trudges off back toward her room.

LAMB
I’m going to go practice my guest
sermon, okay?

MELANIE
Let me know when you’re ready for
hair and makeup.

Melanie and Doug exchange glances as she leaves. This isn’t
the Lamb they know.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 7.

INT. LAMB'S ROOM —- MORNING

Lamb sits on her bed. She wears a modest dress, a flowered
headband and lace tights. Her hair is pulled up into one of
those pouf/braid combos commonly seen on fundamentalist
Christian women.

Melanie has a large professional tacklebox filled with
makeup. She uses a puff to apply some type of cover-up powder
to Lamb’s scars.

MELANIE
This is from our new line. It’s all-
natural minerals from the earth. It
covers everything. You know Shana
Qualley’s mom? She has a lot of
redness from, well, from drinking.
I use this on her and she looks a
lot better. Not good-- that would
take a miracle-- but better.

Lamb says nothing.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
I really don’t like to talk about
people.
(finishing)
There. You look radiant.

Lamb looks at her neck and collarbones in the mirror. It’s
not an improvement. We still see the scars.

LAMB
Dr. Cha says I’m not supposed to
put anything on there.

MELANIE
Lamb, it’s 100% natural. One of our
representatives puts this on her
four-year-old every day.

LAMB
Why?

Melanie is putting away her makeup tools. She closes the
tackle box.

MELANIE
Do you feel ready to give your
guest sermon?

LAMB
Mm-hm
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 8.

MELANIE
If you get nervous, just imagine
Pastor Rick in his underwear.

LAMB
(uncomfortable)
That won’t be necessary.

MELANIE
Let me just hear the beginning.

Lamb sighs, dutiful.

LAMB
“My beloved family in worship. I
stand here today as miraculous
evidence of God’s healing grace...”
Do I have to practice right now?

MELANIE
No. Just remember: God’s counting
on you. You can make a difference
with what you say today. It’s like
I always say, you can affect change
in a small way and it makes a big
ripple. Like a--

LAMB
(interrupting)
Like a toot in the bathtub. I know.

MELANIE
That’s right.

She kisses Lamb’s “pouf.”

EXT. SUPER CHURCH - DAY

The Mannerheim’s car pulls up to a GIANT MEGA-CHURCH COMPLEX.
The vast parking lot is filling up with worshippers.

The church's giant marquee-type sign reads: “WHY ‘TWEET’ AT
SATAN WHEN YOU CAN ‘FOLLOW’ CHRIST?”

INT. MANNERHEIM FAMILY CAR - SAME

The Mannerheim’s are bundled up in parkas and scarves.

Melanie rolls down the window and peeks out at the
overflowing parking lot.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

MELANIE
Will you look at this clusterhug? I
love seeing this many people come
together in His name, don’t you?

LAMB
I think some of them just come for
the smoothies.

We see that one of the many entrances to the church
superstructure says “GOD'S BOUNTY SMOOTHIES & COFFEE.”

DOUG
We're lucky to belong to a church
with amenities. The Catholics don’t
have a juice bar.

LAMB
The Catholics get to drink the
actual blood of Christ.

MELANIE
They think that, don’t they? Aren’t
our differences interesting? I'1l
pray for them. Doug, park over by
the gift shop. I want to pick up a
new journal after church.

(to Lamb)

I’ve been writing.

LAMB
Good for you, Mom.

MELANIE
I'm writing a little story about an
old man and an old woman and their
whole epic love story going back
decades.

LAMB
Sounds like The Notebook.

MELANIE
Um, it’s totally unlike The
Notebook. I wouldn’t copy my own
favorite book that I’ve read 100
times, would I?
(then)
Doug, there’s one.

 

A VAN from an assisted living home pulls into Melanie's
chosen parking spot.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 10.

MELANIE (CONT’D)
(annoyed)
God BLESS it.

INT. SUPER CHURCH - DAY

A loud CHRISTIAN HIP-HOP BAND plays. Two RAPPERS-- a white
guy and an Asian girl-- bust some rhymes.

RAPPER #1
Jesus, you're my savior.
You made me like Xavier.
Roberts. Your creation.
You rule the nation!

RAPPER #2
I love Jesus like William love
Kate. Jesus, you're my prince,
let's set the date.

Melanie, Doug and Lamb take their seats in the front row of
the massive auditorium.

On the walls of the church, we see a few large POSTERS with a
photo of a smiling Lamb. She wears a black dress with pearls;
her neck and arms are creamy and scar-free.

The posters say: LAMB MANNERHEIM SHARES HER INSPIRATIONAL
STORY OF SURVIVAL. SUNDAY, DECEMBER 17, 10:00 SERVICE.

MELANIE
The posters came out nice. I need
one of those for my brag wall.

LAMB
Is that the picture you sent them?
Why did you send them an old photo?

MELANIE

It’s the nicest photo we have of
you. That reminds me, we need to go
to the portrait studio as a family.
We could wear matching outfits and
jump in the air!

(off Lamb’s dour look)
Or we could sit nicely.

Lamb is fixated on the poster.

LAMB
I don’t look like that anymore. I
looked like a Barbie.

(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 11.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Now I look like a Barbie that got
tortured with a lighter.

MELANIE
First of all, you were never any
kind of Barbie. You’re obviously a
Skipper.

She discreetly indicates Lamb’s small chest.

LAMB
Mom!

MELANIE
Honey, if I could crank your arm
and make them grow, I would.
Secondly, self-pity is unbecoming.
You're getting better every day.
People don’t even look anymore.

We see a MOM and DAD trying in vain to keep their KIDS from
staring at Lamb. A LITTLE GIRL, who’s about 2, starts to
point and cry loudly.

MELANIE (CONT’D)
That’s a tough age.

They take their seats. As Melanie and Doug socialize with the
people seated around them, Lamb begins to NOD OFF.

INT. SUPER CHURCH - 40 MINUTES LATER

Lamb WAKES UP, a bit dazed. PASTOR RICK, the young, handsome,
dynamic leader of the congregation, is introducing her.

PASTOR RICH
...-And now, we have a very
inspiring young lady who’s agreed
to talk to all of you today. Lamb
Mannerheim has been a member of our
church family, since, well, since I
was a kid! She’s been a valued
youth evangelist, the valedictorian
of her home school collective and a
favorite performer in our music
ministry. When we think of well-
formed, righteous, feminine role
models, we think about girls like
Lamb.

(clearing his throat)
(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 12.

PASTOR RICH (CONT'D)
As you all know, Lamb survived a
tragic accident while she was away
at Montana Bible College two years
ago. As a community, we felt her
pain and loss. But now, she’s
miraculously back on her feet to
share a courageous Christmas tale
of faith and healing. Brothers and
sisters...Lamb Mannerheim.

Lamb stands up and makes her way to the podium. She gets a
STANDING OVATION from the appreciative crowd.

We can see Pastor Rick CHECK HER OUT briefly (but
inappropriately) as she takes the stage.

LAMB
Thanks Pastor Rich. Good morning,
everyone. I know you’re all
expecting me to deliver testimony
about the accident and how, through
the grace of God, I recovered. But
really, you were hoping to hear
gory details about the crash. Like
how I could smell myself burning,
but I couldn’t feel it.

On Melanie: her face falls. This wasn’t what they practiced.
But Lamb remains calm, smiling, even serene.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Isn't that funny? I was in the
parking lot of a Kroger, on fire,
and as I laid there, all I could
think about was my shoes. That they
looked strange. “I don’t remember
wearing clogs today. Oh. I didn’t.
They’re regular shoes, but they’re
melting. And, come to think of it,
so am I.”

The crowd begins to murmur. Lamb continues brightly.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Well, the accident was bad. But the
surgeries-- those were even worse.
Did you know they can take skin
from your butt and put it on your
back? And where does that leave
your butt?

(chuckling)
I guess thongs are out of the
question now! Sorry Pastor Rick.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 13.

Now everyone is really uncomfortable.

LAMB (CONT'D)

But enough of that. What I’m really
here to say today is that the
horrible, unspeakable pain I
endured didn’t strengthen my faith
in the slightest. In fact, I’ve
become an athiest. I’m here to
share my new wisdom with you.
Everyone, there is no God.

Pastor Rick appears at her side, but she slaps him away.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Don’t touch me. My skin grafts are
very fragile. I could bleed all
over our nice new alter carpeting
and then you’d have to take up
another collection!

(to congregation)
Another collection. You already
tithe most of your income to this
place. How’s that working out for
you? Do the skate park and the
putting green make you feel more
righteous?

MELANIE
Lamb, stop! Get down from there!

LAMB

I’m not done yet, Mom. Almost.
Okay, so I don’t believe in God.
Here’s what I do believe: I believe
in science. I believe in the
doctors who were there when I woke
up. I believe in opiates and
morphine, which work whether you
have faith in them or not. I’m
willing to believe that the
universe was created in an
explosion, and that fish-creatures
crawled out of the mud and evolved
into human beings. And, in our next
presidential election...

(pause)
I may vote for Obama.

That does it. Chaos breaks out in the auditorium.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Before I’m forcibly removed from
the stage, I want to say that I’m
leaving Billings for a while. I’ve
spent my entire life abstaining
from earthly vices and drinking the
smoothie of ignorance concocted by
this very church. Tomorrow, I’m
getting on a plane to Las Vegas,
Nevada, where I plan to gamble,
drink alcohol, and frolic with
homosexuals-—

Melanie seizes control of the podium. Feedback squawks as
Melanie grabs the mic and interrupts in a shaky voice.

MELANIE
I'm very sorry, everyone. My
daughter is still recovering.

LAMB
(sarcastic)
What? Mother, I’m radiant!

Melanie is too close to the mic. Her voice booms in an
unintentionally hilarious way.

MELANIE
Please pray for us.

LAMB
Or don’t. The last time you prayed
for me I wound up looking like
this. Wah-wah!

MELANIE
Let’s get you out of here.

She reaches for Lamb, who lunges back toward the mic, pulling
her cardigan aside to reveal her shoulders. She shouts
cheerfully into the mic.

LAMB
My shoulders look like
turkey bacon! God who?

As Melanie takes Lamb’s elbow and hustles her away from the
podium, she accidentally hurts her daughter's skin.

LAMB (CONT'D)
ow.

She collapses and grabs her elbow.
15.

MELANIE
Oh no! Baby, are you okay?

The sound drops out. Lamb shouts a VERY BAD WORD.

The forbidden curse echoes off the walls of the enormous
church. A fitting climax to Lamb’s public rejection of God.
Doug takes a long, uncomfortable sip from his “God’s Bounty”
smoothie.

INT. AIRPLANE - THE NEXT DAY

Lamb is sitting on the crowded Vegas-bound PLANE. She wears a
modest dress and looks bewildered and overwhelmed.

A TEENAGE GUY, 17, stashes his stuff in the overhead
compartment and climbs into the seat next to hers.

He stares at the fingerless COMPRESSION GARMENTS on her arms
and hands as if they’re some cool accessory.

TEENAGE GUY
Where’d you get those gloves?

Lamb can barely hide her annoyance.

LAMB
The Mayo Clinic.
(then)
They're compression garments. Like
big Band-Aids.

TEENAGE GUY
Oh. Do you cut?

LAMB
Do I what?

TEENAGE GUY
Like, are you a cutter? Do you cut
yourself on purpose, like with a
razor blade or a knife?

LAMB
No.

The guy pulls up his arm to reveal a ladder of 4 or 5 small,
pathetic red slashes. Scratches, barely.

TEENAGE GUY
Check it.
Lamb is offended by these self-inflicted wounds.

LAMB
You should be ashamed of that.

TEENAGE GUY
Why?

LAMB
Because it’s disrespectful. That’s
your arm. You are the earthly
custodian of that arm and you
choose to treat it like a whittling
block?

TEENAGE GUY
A what?

LAMB
A block of wood that one whittles.

TEENAGE GUY
It’s not my fault. My therapist
says I have a textbook “Type D”
personality.

LAMB
"Type D"?

TEENAGE GUY
Depressed. It means you pretty much
want to kill yourself all the time.

Lamb considers this.

LAMB

When I feel “depressed”, I go fora
bike ride in the sunshine or I play
my flute or I read Scripture

(catching herself)
-- well, I don’t read Scripture
since I renounced God, but the
other two. Anyway, I would never
cut my body. That seems
counterintuitive if you’re trying
to be of good cheer.

The guy stares at her.

TEENAGE GUY
Sunshine and the flute? Are you
from that family on TV that has
like 20 kids and is in a cult?

16.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 17.

LAMB
I don’t watch TV.
(quietly)
Also, it’s not a cult. They’re just

Baptists.
A pause. The guy drums his fingers anxiously on the armrests.

TEENAGE GUY
I hate takeoff. I get so jumpy on
planes.

LAMB
There’s pretty much zero chance
this plane will go down.

TEENAGE GUY
I know there’s all those
statistics, like, safer than a car
and stuff but...

LAMB
No. Factually speaking, the odds of
this plane crashing are much lower
than you realize. Like one in
approximately ten trillion, since
I’m on here.

TEENAGE GUY
(scoffing)
What, because you’re magic or
something?

LAMB
No. Because it never happens to
anyone twice.

The guy, realizing, stares at Lamb in awe.
LAMB (CONT'D)
Type D.
(shaking her head)
D for Dummy. My goodness.
She takes a brand new copy of The Audacity of Hope by Barack
Obama out of her bag, cracks the spine, and begins reading.

INT. AIRPLANE - 45 MINUTES LATER

The teenage guy sleeps. Lamb is wide awake, bored with her
book. She gazes out the window.
18.

She turns to the personal IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN on
the seatback in front of her. She presses “Movies.”

Lots of options come up. Lamb scrolls past the family-
friendly categories, determined to corrupt herself. She
chooses a category called “Exclusive! Vegas-Inspired Movies
to Get You in the Mood!”

We see a selection of famous Las Vegas moves: The Hangover.
What Happens in Vegas. Leaving Las Vegas and then...

Showgirls. If it’s possible for a person to blush at the mere
sight of a movie title, Lamb does. The movie is aptly
described as “The Cult Classic Erotic Thriller!”

Lamb glances at her seatmate. Still sleeping. The aisle seat
is occupied by a senior citizen doing Sudoku.

Tentatively, Lamb presses “Play” on Showgirls. She makes sure
no one is looking and settles in.

INT. AIRPLANE - AN HOUR LATER

Lamb is watching the infamous pool sex scene. Her brow is
furrowed, as if she’s watching an interesting ritual from
some foreign civilization.

The teenage guy stirs. Lamb immediately leans forward and
tries to turn off the movie.

TEENAGE GUY
(dazed)
Hm?
(seeing)
Whoa! All right!

Lamb is wildly pressing the “home” icon on the touchscreen.
It’s stuck on Showgirls, frozen in the land of violent pool
sex.

TEENAGE GUY (CONT’D)
What is this? Species?

Lamb is mortified, but holds her head high.

LAMB
Showgirls.

TEENAGE GUY
I would not have thought you would
choose this particular film.
19.

LAMB
Well, I did.
(primly)
I love erotic thrillers.

The guy cranes his neck to check out the screen

TEENAGE GUY
Me too.

Lamb looks away, but her eyes wander back to the screen.

INT. MCCARREN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (ARRIVALS) - DAY

Lamb moves through the airport, past the ding-ding-ding of
slot machines and hordes of tourists. The whole place is
decorated for Christmas and the mood is both festive and
profane.

INT. MCCARREN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (BAGGAGE CLAIM) - NIGHT

Lamb stands at the baggage claim and waits for her suitcase.
She carries her flute in a black case.

Three STRIPPERS from the same flight wait just behind her in
the crowd. They wear sweatsuits in contrasting pastels.

STRIPPER #1 is a Latina beauty with hair down to her waist
and 0% body fat. She stamps her feet dramatically.

STRIPPER #1
I need a smoke so bad.

STRIPPER #2 is a tan, corn-fed blonde.

STRIPPER #2
You're making it worse by talking
about it.

STRIPPER #1
Ladies, I got that feeling like I’m
gonna bank this weekend. I’m gonna
make six Gs.

STRIPPER #2
Nobody makes six Gs anymore. Not
even feature girls.

STRIPPER #1
I know the economy sucks, but this
bubble don’t break.
20.

She does a few booty-pops. The girls giggle.
STRIPPER #3 is a tough, short girl.

STRIPPER #3
If I even make one G, I’‘ll be
happy. We keep coming out here for
the weekends, but truth is, Vegas
is as broke as Montana.

(to Lamb)
Hey, can you grab that big Louie
for me?

A LOUIS VUITTON suitcase is making its way around the
carousel. It’s positioned in such a way that Lamb can reach
it but the stripper can’t. Lamb isn’t sure what a “Louie” is
but she guesses.

LAMB
This one?

She grabs the bag with difficulty and swings it over to its
owner. The strippers see the scars on Lamb’s arm as she
reaches forward.

STRIPPER #3
Girl, what happened to you?

Stripper #1 is embarrassed by her friend’s rudeness.

STRIPPER #1
Lexus!

STRIPPER #3
Looks like someone said they was
gonna cut a bitch and actually did
it. Damn.
(by way of apology)
You still cute, though.

STRIPPER #2
Yeah. She’s cute. She could
probably get a day shift at the
Lumberyard.

LAMB
The Lumberyard?

STRIPPER #1
You know the Lumberyard in Helena?
We work there.
(then, aggressive)
Yeah, I said it. There’s no shame
in the game.
21.

LAMB
Why would you be ashamed of that?
Christ was a carpenter.

The girls exchange glances and burst into peals of laughter.
It’s not “mean girl” laughter, per se, but genuine surprise
at Lamb’s dorkiness.

STRIPPER #2
We're not carpenters. The
Lumberyard is a gentlemen's club.

LAMB
Oh. Ah. You’d think I would have
gotten that, since I just watched
Showgirls on the plane.
(whispering)
I know all about what you do.

An awkward beat.

STRIPPER #3
Right. You got it all figured out.

The girls shake their heads as Lamb reaches onto the baggage
carousel and takes her childish pink suitcase. We see peeling
letters printed on the suitcase: GOING TO GRANDMA’S.

Lamb extends the handle and walks away, rolling it behind her
with her head held high. The strippers watch, amused.

EXT. MCCARREN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (TAXI STAND) - DUSK

Lamb approaches the taxi stand, where a jaded ATTENDANT flags
down cars. Clutching her printed itinerary, she takes a deep

breath.

LAMB
One taxi, please.

ATTENDANT
Uh-huh. Where you headed?

LAMB
Um, the Planet Hollywood Resort?

ATTENDANT
Play-Ho. Got it.

LAMB
Planet Hollywood.
22.

The attendant tosses her pink suitcase carelessly into the
trunk of a waiting cab. It lands with a THUNK as Lamb meekly
protests.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Hey, I have dishes in there.

The man stares at her.

ATTENDANT
Why'd you bring dishes to Las
Vegas?

Lamb climbs into the back seat of the cab. She goes to buckle
up and discovers only a lap belt.

LAMB
(to driver)
Sir? Is there a shoulder belt?

DRIVER
(thickly accented)
What, you want a baby seat too?
Goo goo.

The attendant slams the door shut and the cab squeals away.

INT. TAXI CAB - EVENING

Lamb admires the spectacular lights of the Strip from the
back of the cab. Remembering Showgirls, she decides to ask
about a certain Vegas landmark.

LAMB
Excuse me, sir. Where is the
Stardust?

The driver's accent and ethnic background are impossible to
place.

DRIVER
Eh?

LAMB
The Stardust Hotel. Where they have
the Goddess musical performance?

DRIVER
Stardust? That was, eh, bombed a
few years ago. Blown up inside with
dynamite. Big boom.

Lamb has been raised to be very wary of terrorism.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 23.

LAMB
Oh, no.
(whispering)
Was it Muslims?

DRIVER

Muslims? No, man! The guy who owned
it blew it up with purpose so he
could build a new hotel. What do
you think I know about some
terrorists?

(then)
Ah, I hate this Trop light.

They're stopped at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard
and Tropicana. It’s gridlock on every side.

LAMB
Trop light?
DRIVER
Yeah, man. Tropicana. Longest light

in town.

The cab slows to a stop. Lamb looks out the window at the New
York, New York roller coaster and the Excalibur’s fake castle
turrets illuminated overhead. She’s enchanted by the sight.

LAMB
Kind of looks like Disney World.

DRIVER
(sarcastic)
Disney World. Ha. That place? You
ever been to Disney World?

LAMB
No. I wasn’t allowed to, because
the Disney Corporation supports the
homosexual agenda.

DRIVER

Last night, in this cab, I have two
gay guys getting married. I got no
problem with it. As long as they
keep their penis inside the blue
jeans. I said, if I see some gay, I
see some Doogie Howser bullshit,
you're out! Here we are.

He pulls over to the curb quickly, sending Lamb flying.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 24.

EXT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD - SAME

The driver takes Lamb’s pink suitcase out of the trunk. Lamb
nervously peels off a few bills from a conspicuously large
WAD OF CASH.

LAMB
Here.

DRIVER
Thanks. Hey, you know how you said
you weren’t allowed to go to Disney
World?

LAMB
Yes?

DRIVER
Was the Disney Channel also
forbidden?

LAMB
Yes, sir. Emphatically so.

DRIVER
Even The Wizards of Waverley Place?

LAMB
Satanists.

Lamb turns and walks toward the hotel with her suitcase and
her flute.

The driver looks down with surprise at the LARGE WAD OF MONEY
she’s handed him.

DRIVER
You sure?

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD - EVENING

Lamb walks into the hotel. She scans the room nervously. It’s
early in the evening. TOURISTS play craps and blackjack and
wander around with drinks. The scene is relatively tame and
even a little hokey. Lamb seems relieved.

LAMB
Huh. It’s kinda like Branson.

An OLD WOMAN pulls the lever on a cheesy branded slot
machine. The machine discharges a few quarters.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 25.

LAMB (CONT'D)
No problem.

She steps forward bravely.

INT. HOTEL GIFT SHOP - EVENING

Lamb, checked in, tucks her room key into her pocket. She’s
about to walk to the elevator, but she pauses and goes into
the hotel’s gift shop.

Lamb takes a tacky, sparkly T-shirt off one of the racks. It
says “I (HEART) LAS VEGAS,” only instead of a heart, there is-—
- nonsensically-- a pair of dice.

LAMB
(whispering)
“I Dice Las Vegas.”

It doesn't look like anything Lamb would normally wear. But
nothing about this night is normal.

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD (ELEVATOR AREA) - EVENING

Lamb, now holding a SHOPPING BAG, waits for an elevator to
take her up to her room. From where she stands, we can
already hear some raucous shouting coming up the elevator
shaft.

The elevator doors open, revealing about 5 WET FRAT BOYS
coming up from the pool area. They’re drunk and in various
states of undress. Think damp towels, tribal tattoos,
steroidal acne and loud, booming voices.

FRAT GUY #1
I swear, I only had a half a pill,
but I’m rolling so hard.

FRAT GUY #2
Dude, I’m flying. We should call
those sluts from Tao and get an
eight ball for tonight.

FRAT GUY #1
Phenomenal, bro!

FRAT GUY #3
Phenomenal.

FRAT GUY #4
Hey.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 26.

The shouting and laughing stops abruptly when they notice
Lamb standing there. Silence. Lamb primly steps into the
elevator.

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD (ELEVATOR) - SAME

The frat boys are trying to hold it together, but they’re
making crazy expressions at each other and (barely)
suppressing laughter. They don’t know how to respond to a
pretty girl who’s been desexualized by injury. Finally, one
of the guys talks.

FRAT GUY #2
Hi.

LAMB
Hello.

One of the guys begins to crowd her in a creepy way. He
strokes her ponytail. One of them whispers

FRAT GUY #2
Uh, where are you from?

The other guys snicker. This is the equivalent of the high
school quarterback hitting on an ugly girl to make his
friends laugh.

FRAT GUY #3
(under his breath)
Chernobyl. Huh huh.

LAMB
I’m from D.C.
FRAT GUY #2
Oh yeah?
LAMB
Yes. I’m a federal agent. Drug
enforcement.
FRAT GUY #4
Oh really?
LAMB

I just orchestrated a huge meth lab
sting in Iowa. The place blew sky
high. Messed me up pretty bad, as
you can see. But I’m back in
action. Vegas is my new beat.

Lamb's voice is shaking, but she sticks to her story.
27.

FRAT GUY #3
Wow.

LAMB
I'm looking forward to making some
arrests. The people here aren’t
very discreet, so it should be
easy! Plus, I’m a super-smeller.
You know drug-sniffing dogs? I'ma
drug-sniffing human. I’m accurate
up to four yards, that’s how I got
into the DEA. I beat out a golden
retriever in tests.

FRAT GUY #2
(to his friend)
Hey, let’s get off here, man.

FRAT GUY #1
Yeah, yeah. We passed our floor.

They begin stabbing buttons in a panic. The doors open on the
mezzanine level.

LAMB
This isn’t your level is it? This
looks like a convention of Chicano
attorneys.

An easel-style SIGN welcomes people to the NATIONAL
CONFERENCE OF CHICANO ATTORNEYS.

Nevertheless, the frat guys all scurry off the elevator,
failing to blend in with the crowd.

Lamb exhales as the doors close. She closes her eyes. The
encounter scared her more than she let on.

EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lamb takes out her key card. We see a group of cute, happy 20-
SOMETHING GIRLS headed out for a night on the town. They skip
down the hall toward the elevator, holding hands.

GIRL #1
Wait, Zoe, this is your first time
seeing Cirque? You're so gonna cry.

GIRL #2
Oh my God, I know.
28.

GIRL #3
Liz, those shoes are phenomenal. So
phenomonal.

GIRLS #1 AND #3
Phenomenal!

Wistfully, Lamb watches them as they pass. She tries out the
word everyone her age is (over)using.

LAMB
Phenomenal. Phenomenal.

She slides her key into the door. The light turns green.

INT. LAMB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

It’s a much nicer hotel room than we might expect a young,
small-town traveler to stay in. Lamb unzips her suitcase.
There’s a BROKEN “FIESTAWARE” DISH on top of her neatly
folded clothes. She sadly removes the pieces.

LAMB
Shoot.

There are three other dishes that are intact. Lamb removes
them and carefully stacks them on the TV console.

Then, she begins to hang up her clothes.

INT. BATH/SHOWER - NIGHT

Through frosted glass, we can barely make out Lamb’s
silhouette. She stands in a big, square Vegas bathtub. Her
compression garments are hanging on the towel rack.

Rather than normal showering sounds, we hear a trickle of
water. Lamb is washing herself slowly and methodically. Her
hand clutches a bar for support. We see how her movement is
limited and that something as simple as bathing has become
complicated for her.

She quietly sings, her voice echoing off the walls.

LAMB
(singing)
The wind is moving, but I am
standing still...
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 29.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Lamb slides a compression sleeve up her arm.

LAMB
A life of pages, waiting to be
filled...

INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Lamb, now wearing her sequined Vegas T-shirt and her
customary knee-length denim skirt, brushes her hair and
slides her stocking-covered feet into pink flats.

LAMB
Feels like I'm looking for a
reason...

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Lamb rides down to the lobby with a group of shoddily dressed
TOURISTS. As always, she wears her cardigan, though the T-
shirt’s sequined logo is visible. She sings under her breath.

LAMB
Roamin' through the night to
find...

The doors open.

LAMB (CONT'D)
My place in this world. My place...

INT. CASINO - DAY

As the elevator doors open, Lamb’s ears are suddenly
assaulted with autotuned, bass-heavy hip-hop music. The mood
of the hotel has changed considerably. Shit is GOING OFF.

Lamb walks through the casino, observing the chaos.

A few hired DANCERS are working the pole next to a craps
table. Lamb stares at their hard, flawless bodies as they
writhe and gyrate, bored.

A PREGNANT BRIDE in handcuffs and a light-up “penis tiara”
gets led through the lobby by her FRIENDS. Lamb’s eyes widen
as the colorful penises blink at her, as if in code.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 30.

In a nearby bar, a MIDDLE-AGED MAN plants his mouth at the
bottom of an ice luge while someone pours vodka down the
ramp.

LAMB
That doesn’t seem clean.

At a centrally located casino buffet, TOURISTS scoop piles of
crab legs onto their plates. Even something as innocent as
food seems to become excessive and wasteful in Las Vegas.

A crab leg falls off the plate of a JOLLY FEMALE TOURIST.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Excuse me, you dropped a...leg.

CRAB TOURIST
(to friend, ignoring Lamb)
Ha! No, no, no, no Leslie. You’re
on crack! You are legit smoking
crack. Wait, that’s my phone.

LAMB
A crab was trapped and asphyxiated
so that you might be nourished by
its leg.

The woman still isn’t listening. Lamb might as well be
invisible. Finally, Lamb scurries over to the buffet area and
picks the leg off the floor.

Immediately, a STERN BUFFET ATTENDANT rushes away from his
prime rib carving station and confronts Lamb.

BUFFET ATTENDANT
Ma’am, the buffet is for paying
customers, not scavengers.

LAMB
(shocked)
I wasn’t scavenging. She’s wasting
food.

BUFFET ATTENDANT
Oh, I saw the whole thing. The king
crab leg hit the floor and you came
scurrying out of nowhere like a
dirty raccoon.

LAMB
I did not scurry. These people are
gluttons.

(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 31.

LAMB (CONT'D)
It’s like they think crabs come
from a factory, rather than a
delicate marine ecosystem. They
have no respect for life.

BUFFET ATTENDANT
Are you from PETA? Do you hate the
circus and pony rides?

LAMB
What? No.

BUFFET ATTENDANT
Are you one of those anti-abortion
psychos?

LAMB
I don’t think so...

BUFFET ATTENDANT
“Hookers for Jesus”?

LAMB
I suppose I just think buffets are
wasteful.

BUFFET ATTENDANT
Please leave my carving
station immediately.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

Lamb walks down the street, dejected. She passes a NASTY
LITTLE MAN handing out fliers for female escorts.

NASTY LITTLE MAN
Merry Christmas! Beautiful, sexy
girls! Hot girls delivered to your
room!

Lamb plucks a flier from his outstretched hand. It says: REAL
GIRLS! NO BULL! A photo of a YOUNG BRUNETTE GIRL gazes out at
Lamb. The caption reads: RYDER, 19. MASSAGE, ROLE PLAY,
SHOWER, GREEK. ANYTHING GOES!

Lamb’s face falls. For some reason, she stuffs the flier into
her purse, even though it repulses her.

She keeps walking and encounters a YOUNG CHRISTIAN EVANGELIST
handing out RELIGIOUS COMIC BOOKS.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 32.

EVANGELIST
Jesus saves! Accept Christ as your
Lord and Savior today! Christ died
for your sins.

Lamb looks at the young evangelist, seeing herself in his or
her hopeful gaze. The evangelist thrusts a book into Lamb’s
hands.

EVANGELIST (CONT’D)
Here. This comic book contains the
key to eternal life.

The comic is called “Viva Las Satan?” The cover depicts a
smirking DEVIL presiding over a poker table. Lamb takes one
and examines it with an air of familiarity.

LAMB

(holding up comic)
Ah yes. A fine title from Salvation
Press. I’m acquainted with this
one. At the end, the gamblers all
go to hell and learn that God’s
love was the real jackpot. Oh, and
Jews are vampires. The end.

She hands the comic book back to the evangelist.

EVANGELIST
Oh. Are you saved?

LAMB
Do I look saved?

EVANGELIST
Um, well, we’re all redeemed
through Christ’s love. If we accept
it. Would you like to pray with me
and be saved?

LAMB
My parents used to take me to
Bighorn Canyon every summer.
There’s this place where you can
stand on the edge and get a triple
echo if you yell loud enough.

EVANGELIST
I don’t get it.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 33.

LAMB
I would just yell my own name over
and over, and eventually I could
convince myself that someone was
calling out to me.

EVANGELIST
Maybe you need to re-read this.

She tries to hand Lamb the comic book again, but Lamb seizes
her wrist. Lamb’s eyes are shining, solemn.

LAMB
You're wasting your life. I can
already tell it’s too late for me
to be normal. Maybe it’s not too
late for you.

EVANGELIST
Let go of me.

EXT. IMPERIAL PALACE HOTEL & CASINO - NIGHT

Lamb has been wandering for a while when she comes upon the
enormous neon facade of the Imperial Palace. There’s a sign
advertising “LIVE DEALER-TAINERS! Only place in Vegas where
the dealers SING and DANCE!"

Lamb shrugs, exhausted, and enters.

INT. IMPERIAL PALACE - NIGHT
MUSIC UP: “Holly Jolly Christmas”

Lamb enters the lobby of the hotel. The night is in full
swing. She walks toward the main bar.

The bartender, “SWEET” WILLIAM CARR, is in his mid thirties.
He would be handsome in the right scenario, but Vegas has
taken its toll on him. His hair is a mess, his expression is
weary, and arms are patterned with tattoos of questionable
quality.

LAMB
Excuse me, bartender?

William seems annoyed by this formal mode of address.

WILLIAM
Yes, drunkard?
Lamb scans the liquor selection and lands on a bright,
cartoonish looking bottle.

LAMB
I’ll have the peach schnapps.

William shudders visibly at this request.

WILLIAM
Peach schnapps. Neat?

Lamb blinks.
WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Would you like ice?
LAMB

No thanks. Takes up too much room
in the glass, and I want as much

liquor as possible.
At this point, William is humoring her.

BARTENDER
Oh. I agree.

34.

As he grabs a highball glass from behind the bar, he looks at

Lamb’s T-shirt and reads it.

WILLIAM
(deadpan)
“I Dice Las Vegas.”
LAMB
It doesn’t really make sense,
does it?
William likes to spook young girls. He lunges across
and stares her down accusingly.
WILLIAM

It makes perfect sense if you’ve
come to here chop people up into

little pieces.

Lamb doesn’t flinch.

LAMB
Oh, great. ‘Cause that’s totally

why I’m here.

William slides the schnapps across to Lamb.

the bar
35.

LAMB (CONT'D)
When do the “dealer-tainers”
perform?

WILLIAM
Let’s see, it’s almost nine...ah,
yes. Looks like my dear friend
Loray is on deck.

He gestures to a YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN leaving a
crowded blackjack table. Another DEALER is in the process of
subbing in at the table.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Here we go.

An EMCEE’s voice booms over the microphone.

EMCEE
Ladies and gentlemen, the Imperial
Palace is proud to present the
musical stylings of our dealing
diva, Loray!

William mutters to himself as he wipes down the bar.

WILLIAM
She hates the word “diva.”

People at the bar turn toward Loray as she moves to the
center of the room, holding a cordless mic. She has a
commanding presence, even in her silly Imperial Palace
uniform. The bar patrons begin to murmur and speculate as to
what Loray might sing.

MALE PATRON
Ooh. Look at this black girl! I bet
she’s gonna blow the doors off.

His friend’s response is equally stereotypical.

PATRON #2
Oh yeah man, she’s gonna take us to
church!

PATRON #1

(calling out)
Do Aretha! “Respect!”

Loud, recorded music fills the casino. But it’s not the
powerhouse R&B song everyone is expecting.

Rather, it’s the gentlest, whitest ballad imaginable: “In My
Room,” by the Beach Boys,
36.

Loray’s voice is pure and sweet.

LORAY
There's a world where I can go and
tell my secrets to. In my room...

PATRON #1
BOOOOO! What is this?

Patron #2 dismisses Loray with a pointed finger, jabbing
wildly to the left as if to direct her offstage.

PATRON #2
To the left, girl!

An elderly WHITE WOMAN turns to her companion.

OLD WHITE WOMAN
(disappointed)
I thought she was going to
have soul.

William returns to Lamb’s corner of the bar, shaking his head
as the customers hiss and complain.

WILLIAM
She’s not supposed to sing this.
She’s been warned.

Indeed, we see the PIT BOSS frowning at his defiant employee.

LAMB
But it’s beautiful.
WILLIAM
People here don’t want beautiful.
They want--
DRUNK GIRL
(screaming)
Ke$ha!
LAMB

I don’t know what that is.

LORAY
Now it's dark and I'm alone but I
won't be afraid...

Lamb watches Loray sing and is affected. There’s something so
brave about Loray’s sincerity and conviction in this room
full of bawdy revelers.
37.

William, despite his toughness, is touched by the fact that
Lamb is touched.

BARTENDER
I’m William.

LAMB
Lamb. Lamb Mannerheim.

She offers him her GLOVED HAND. He notices the compression
garment for the first time, but only hesitates for an instant
before shaking her hand.

Loray finishes her song on a high, clear note.

LORAY
In my room...

Lamb takes her first sip of the drink and makes a horrified
face. A river of peach nastiness escapes down her chin.
William hands her a cocktail napkin as tepid applause fills
the casino.

WILLIAM
Was that your first, ah, schnapp?

Lamb’s voice is a faint croak.

LAMB
My first anything.

WILLIAM
Here. This is called a “water
back.”
(winking)
All the experienced drinkers
order these.

He gives Lamb a glass of water. She downs it gratefully.

Lamb takes a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE out of her purse,
shaking a few capsules into her hand. She puts the bottle
down for a moment to politely applaud Loray.

As Lamb turns away, William zeroes in on the label, reading
it: VICODIN (HYDROCODONE). His eyes are filled with longing.
Desire. Pain.

Lamb turns back and William acts casual. Loray is headed
straight for the bar. She squeezes in next to Lamb.
38.

LORAY
Well, the good news is, I’m off for
the night. We are officially on
LST: Loray Standard Time.

WILLIAM
You were great, honey. In what may
have been your final performance.

LORAY
Yup, my ass is grass. Management
says they want me to sing
“Respect.” I mean, can you believe
that?

WILLIAM
(dry)
No. Why would anyone want to hear a
rousing Motown crowd-pleaser?

LAMB
I loved your song.

Loray barely glances at Lamb.

LORAY
Brian Wilson. That’s my jam. I
mean, I prefer his more obscure
compositions, but...

WILLIAM
Loray, this is my new friend Lamb

Loray looks at Lamb then back at William. She rolls her eyes
as if to say: you're hitting on this?

LORAY
I hope that’s Pedialyte, ‘cause
your new friend is 10.

LAMB
I’m 21.

Loray glances at Lamb’s modest decolletage.

LORAY
21 double-A. You're a fetus.

She accepts a COCKTAIL that William has automatically poured
for her; we can see this is a standard end-of-shift ritual.

WILLIAM
Lamb is...what, celebrating her
birthday? Where are your friends?
(MORE )
39.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Surely there must be a gaggle of
drunk college girls looking for

you.
LORAY
A gaggle? No, I think a pride.
WILLIAM
A murder. Like crows.
LORAY
No, no, no, a flock! Get it? A
flock of--
WILLIAM

Too obvious, honey.

LAMB
I’m here in town alone, actually.

Loray looks up from her drink and snorts.

LORAY
Uh-oh.

LAMB
Excuse me?

LORAY
Let me guess. You came here-- hm,
best case scenario, you came here
to be...
(deciding)
A showgirl.

LAMB
No.

LORAY
Come on. You’re sitting here alone
on a Monday night in December. Cute
little face, calling yourself
LAAAM-buh.

LAMB
That’s my real name.

LORAY
Weave down to your butt...

LAMB
This is my hair.
40.

LORAY
Bleach blonde...

LAMB
Real blonde. I’m half Finnish.

Loray tosses back most of her cocktail.

LORAY
Hey, look. I’m half-finish, too.
(to William)
Top me off.

She chuckles and heads toward the bathroom. William reaches
for Loray’s glass to refill it.

Before he can stop Lamb, she’s jumped off the stool and is
following Loray. Bad idea.

WILLIAM
Don’t chase it into its cave. It
bites.

Lamb realizes she’s left her purse hanging on the chair.
Naively, she continues on her way, calling back to William.

LAMB
Watch my purse, please. Thanks!

INT. IMPERIAL PALACE (BATHROOM) - SAME

A TOILET flushes. Loray emerges from the stall and sees Lamb
standing by the sinks, her eyes narrow and indignant.

LORAY
Whoa. You look like an
angry...baby...cobra.
(beat)
Look, I’m sorry I gave you shit
back there. I have to amuse myself
somehow.

LAMB
I’m not a showgirl.

Loray pumps soap into her hands, annoyed.

LORAY
No one cares what you are.

Lamb is overly invested in proving her innocence.
41.

LAMB
I care very much. I care how I’m
perceived. Besides, I could never
do that even if I wanted to.
(solemn)
People would stare. I have a
condition. A skin condition.

She holds up her gloved hands. Loray, who is casually rinsing
her hands in the sink, barely glances.

LORAY
Yeah? I have a skin condition too.
It’s called “black.”

She laughs at Lamb’s angst.

LORAY (CONT'D)
(mocking)

“People would stare.” Yeah. Try

being me at the cell phone store.

LAMB
Um...

Loray walks up to the high-tech Dyson hand dryer, her
dripping fingers outstretched.

LORAY
Shh. This is the best part.

She lowers her hands into the wind tunnel, then withdraws
them slowly and indulgently.

LORAY (CONT'D)
Love the Airblade.

She shakes her head, satisfied. As she heads for the door,
Lamb interrupts once more.

LAMB
I'm from a conservative religious
community where I wasn’t allowed to
date or dance or even attend a
normal school. Then I was in an
accident that left a third of my
body burned and disfigured. I don’t
think there is a God anymore, which
is a pretty big deal for me to be
saying, because God used to be
sorta my jam.

Loray blinks.
42.

LAMB (CONT'D)
I left my home for the first time
today because I feel like I’ve
missed out on all of this and I
want to experience worldly
pleasures for the first time.

LORAY
Wow. Am I in the first five minutes
of pornography?

LAMB
No, I--

LORAY

That is quite the pitch, Lamb. I
have heard some crazy stories from
some broken folks here in the
People’s Republic of Bad Choices,
but that one? That one takes the
whole hash brownie.

(suspicious)
Are you looking for money or
something? Are you a junkie? I bet
those gloves are covering some
tracks...

Lamb whips off her cardigan wordlessly. We see not Lamb, but
Loray, as she looks at Lamb’s scars.

LORAY (CONT'D)

Oh.
LAMB
Oh.
LORAY
You're telling the truth.
LAMB
Yes.
LORAY

And you're all by yourself, looking
for trouble. You want to be a
criminal?

LAMB
No. No, not a criminal. I just want
to be an American.
43.

INT. IMPERIAL PALACE (CASINO FLOOR) - DAY

Loray is walking quickly across the casino floor. She’s
changed into STREET CLOTHES and carries a backpack. Lamb
trots after her eagerly.

LAMB
Where are we going?

LORAY
I don’t know yet. I know if I leave
you by yourself, you’re going to
wind up somewhere horrible, like
the trunk of a car or Circus
Circus. I feel an strange sense of
responsibility toward you. You're
just a little deep-fried pickle
from Ohio...

LAMB
Montana.

They're veering back toward the BAR, where William regards
them with curiosity.

LORAY
From Montana, population four, and
you came here to commit sins. What
did you have in mind, specifically?

LAMB
Well, intoxicants, games of
chance...

LORAY
Sex?

(looking Lamb over)
I’m sure you’ll have no problem
finding someone to wreck that.

Lamb is uncomfortable with this suggestion.

LAMB
Um, well, just basically the whole
Vegas experience.
(then)
Hey, thanks for watching my purse!

They've arrived at the bar. Lamb takes her purse from
William, who looks a bit guilty.

WILLIAM
Thanks for believing in me. What’s
going on?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 44,

LORAY
I’m taking Lamb downtown.

WILLIAM
OMF-Jesus.

LAMB
You should come with us!

LORAY
William’s in the program. He only
goes out for donuts and his “Higher
Power.”

WILLIAM
I’m off at eleven.
(to Loray)
You have my number. The new number,
the 702...

Loray raises an eyebrow at him, surprised.
LORAY
I got your number all right,
Pedo-Bear. Have a nice night.

LAMB
Wait! This is to pay for my drink.

She tosses a single bill onto the bar as Loray hustles her
toward the casino exit.

LORAY
Come on, Lamb..what’s your last
name?
LAMB
Mannerheim.
LORAY
Jewish?

Lamb gasps, delighted by this “shocking” suggestion.

LAMB
No!

They disappear out the casino doors.

LORAY
Uh, sorry?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 45.

LAMB
No, it’s cool! Did you really think
I was Jewish? Wow!

BACK ON WILLIAM: Watching their departing forms, William
scoops the money off the bar. Like the cab driver, he’s
surprised by the bill’s denomination.

INT. LORAY’S CAR - NIGHT

Lamb rides shotgun in Loray’s beat-up Hyundai. We hear a
DIALOGUE SNIPPET from the Natural Born Killers soundtrack,
followed by the appropriate song.

LAMB
Why are we leaving?

LORAY
If you want to see Las Vegas, we
have to go to Las Vegas.

LAMB
But we’re in Las Vegas.

LORAY
No, we’re not. We’re in Paradise.

Lamb is perplexed.

LORAY (CONT'D)

They may call this the “Vegas
Strip,” but it’s actually located
in a census-designated area called
Paradise. Paradise, Nevada. You can
look it up. Most tourists don’t
know. They all say they’re headed
to Vegas, but technically, they're
going to Paradise.

Lamb stares longingly out at the lights of the Strip.

LAMB
Well, maybe I want to see
Paradise, then.

LORAY
No you don’t, Lamb. Paradise is
processed cheese. Do you want
roller coasters and a fake Eiffel
Tower and a bunch of tourists
clapping for a frigging
computerized fountain? Yay, robot!
Yay, robot fountain! No.

(MORE )
46.

LORAY (CONT'D)
You want real Las Vegas, where the
locals go. None of this trifling
theme park trash.

Actually, the other stuff sounded pretty good to Lamb.

LAMB
It’s just that I’ve never been to a
theme park. Besides Creation Land.

LORAY
What is Creation Land?

LAMB
It’s a place in South Dakota with
rides and um, exhibits about how
humans were created by God and
lived among the dinosaurs.

Loray throws her head back and laughs heartily.

LAMB (CONT'D)
They have a pretty cool log
ride...Oh, the Trop Light. This is
the worst, huh?

They're stuck at the infamous traffic light. Loray looks
suspiciously at Lamb.

LORAY
“Trop Light.” How long have you
been here? You’re sure you’re not a
hooker?

LAMB
It bothers me so much when you say
things like that.

LORAY
Sorry.

LAMB
Terrible.

EXT. “REAL” LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Loray drives through downtown Vegas, aka “Glitter Gulch.”
Everything seems dirtier, more tragic, and also much more
romantic.

LORAY
Glitter Gulch. This is the real
life, yes indeed.
47.

Lamb rolls down the window, then cautiously rolls it back up
halfway.

LAMB
This is where you go for fun?
LORAY
Sure, when I’m not at school or at
the Palace.
LAMB
(surprised)

You go to school?

LORAY
Yeah, UNLV. Is that so shocking?
You don’t have any black friends,
do you? Everyone says they have the
one black friend, but you don’t
even know that guy.

LAMB
We had a visiting pastor from
Africa all last summer.
LORAY
If he comes back next year, tell
him Loray says hi.
Lamb changes the subject.

LAMB
What’s your major?

Loray expertly maneuvers herself into a parking spot.

LORAY
Filn.

LAMB
Oh. There was nothing like that at
my college.
Lamb shakes her head as they climb out of the car.

LORAY
Really? Nobody made shorts?

LAMB
We weren’t allowed to wear shorts.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 48.

EXT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE - NIGHT

A line of LOCAL HIPSTERS snakes around outside Loray’s
favorite bar, The Sceptre. Loray and Lamb are quickly waved
to the front of the line.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE - NIGHT
Close on Lamb’S GLOVED HAND, gripping an oversized LEVER.

LORAY (0.S.)
All right, let’s get this out of
the way. Pull.

Reveal Lamb in the crowded bar, the kind of place that has
Christmas lights even when it isn’t Christmas. She eagerly
yanks the lever on a campy vintage SLOT MACHINE. The
machine’s display reveals a CHERRY, a BELL and “BAR.”

LORAY (CONT'D)
There. You gambled. You played your
game of chance. And now you see why
it’s stupid. Let’s move.

She tries to urge Lamb ahead, but Lamb is perplexed.

LAMB
What’s “bar”? Did I lose?

LORAY
Yes, Lamb, you lost. Ultimately,
everyone loses. If you lit that
dollar on fire, at least you'd have
kindling. I have no respect for
gamblers.

They make their way toward the bar.

LAMB
You deal cards for a living.

LORAY
That's right, for a living. Not for
my own personal edification.
Charlie! Hey, Charlie!

CHARLIE, a cute, tattooed FEMALE BARTENDER, looks up from the
taps, where she’s busily filling pints. She grins.

CHARLIE
Loray-who-I-wanna-lay. What are we
thinking?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 49.

LORAY
I’m thinking we're going to need
some shots. Line ‘em up.

BEGIN DRINKING SEQUENCE

Loray and Lamb are ensconced at their own tiny table near the
jukebox. Loray’s HIPSTER FRIENDS hover around them. They wear
tight jeans, scarves, ironic T-shirts, weird beards, the
whole nine. Loud music blasts. The mood is crowded, boozy and
festive.

A tray of assorted shots sits in front of them. Loray downs
one effortlessly; Lamb attempts a sip.

Loray proudly plays show-and-tell with her new “discovery.”
LORAY (CONT'D)
Lamb’s from Montana. She was home-
schooled.

The hipsters shout over the jukebox, admiring Lamb.

HIPSTER #1
Wow! That’s awesome.
LAMB
It is?
HIPSTER #2

It’s anti-establishment. The public
school system in this country a
joke. I’m going to home-school my
kids for sure.

LAMB
Maybe don’t do that.

LORAY
Lamb has never danced. She’s not on
Facebook. She’s never even seen an
R-rated movie.

LAMB
I saw The Passion of the Christ.

HIPSTER #3
So basically, you’ve avoided so
much empty, spirit-stealing pop
culture.
(beat)
You're lucky.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 50.

HIPSTER #1
Right? It’s so punk rock.
LAMB
Thanks?
LORAY

Watch her try to drink this.

Loray pushes a SWEET TART toward Lamb. Everyone watches Lamb
as if she’s an exotic zoo animal. Lamb takes a tentative sip
of the vile pink concoction. Her face crumples.

HIPSTER #1
She can’t do it!

HIPSTER #2
Her face, like, repels the booze.

HIPSTER #3
Amazing.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE (ANOTHER CORNER OF THE BAR) - NIGHT

A HIPSTER GIRL and her GAY HIPSTER FRIEND drape a trendy
fringed SCARF over Lamb’s neck, tucking it fashionably.

HIPSTER GIRL
This is so cute on you. It’1ll cover
up some of your battle damage.

LAMB
I like it. What is it?

GAY HIPSTER FRIEND
It’s a keffiyeh.

LAMB
A what?

HIPSTER GIRL
A keffiyeh. It’s a Muslim head
scarf.

Lamb nearly does a SPIT TAKE.

LAMB
(choked)
Muslim?

GAY HIPSTER FRIEND
Oh, don’t worry; it’s not offensive
to them or anything.

(MORE )
51.

GAY HIPSTER FRIEND (CONT'D)
These things are so popular;
they're totally depoliticized.

LAMB
Okay.

The two of them admire their handiwork. The scarf does look
kind of adorable on Lamb.

GAY HIPSTER FRIEND HIPSTER GIRL
SO CUTE. SO CUTE.
HIPSTER GIRL
Phenomenal.
LAMB

Why does everyone keep saying
phenomenal? A scarf isn't a
phenomenon of any kind.

GAY HIPSTER FRIEND
On you it is. You go, Baby Gisele.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE (DANCE FLOOR) - NIGHT

Lamb and another GROUP OF HIPSTERS are on the postage-stamp-
sized dance floor. Everyone BOPS AROUND to the Black Keys.
Lamb bends her knees awkwardly. She doesn’t know how to dance
and her skin grafts limit her movement.

DANCING HIPSTER
(to friend, pointing at
Lamb )
She was in a plane crash.

DANCING HIPSTER #2
Like, a 747?

LAMB
It was a single-engine plane.

DANCING HIPSTER
You've had a crazy life, man.

Loray dances over holding two cans of CHEAP DOMESTIC BEER.
She shouts over the loud music.

LORAY
Look. You’re on a dance floor and
hell hasn’t swallowed you up.

Lamb looks around at the DANCING IDIOTS in skinny jeans.
52.

LAMB

(dry)
Are you sure?

LORAY
Ha. All right.

LAMB
Hey, I just realized that we do
have something in common.

LORAY
We do, huh?

LAMB
Yes. You don’t have any black
friends either.

LORAY
Drink your beer.

She hands Lamb a beer. Lamb looks at the CAN. The beer is
called “Snowy Piste”; the can depicts a man skiing down a
mountain.

LAMB
“Snowy Piste.”

LORAY
It’s ironically delicious.
(then)
Oh, shit. Look who came out for the
first time in MONTHS.

She shouts toward the offending entrant. Lamb peeks up over
the bobbing heads.

LORAY (CONT'D)
Sweet William.

William nods at them as he passes the doorman and maneuvers
himself through the crowd. Lamb sees him and lights up. She
waves. Loray seems sincerely shocked-- perhaps even a bit
hurt-- by William’s arrival.

LORAY (CONT'D)
He never comes out. Never-ever-ever-
ever-ever....

Lamb interrupts the drunken broken record.

LAMB
Right, he doesn’t come out.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 53.

William makes his way to dance floor. He looks good in his
non-bartender street clothes. Tough, but good.

LORAY
William, I thought you were going
to pick up a second shift tonight.

WILLIAM
I changed my mind, called Patti.
(to Lamb)
I thought Loray was going to look
after you. She’s got you drinking
“Snowy Piss?”

LAMB
I haven't had a sip. As it turns
out, I’m hopeless at drinking.

Loray grabs Lamb’s beer can and shotguns it.

WILLIAM
I could have told you that back at
the hotel. I was there for the
“schnapp-ocalypse.”

LAMB
I’m going to go get a cup of water
or something.

Smiling, she dashes off to the bar. Loray shimmies up next to
William, dancing. He frowns at her as she does the Swim.

WILLIAM
What are you doing, Lor? Show-and-
tell?

LORAY

Hey, she wanted to come here.
William, she’s from, like, a
religious commune. Okay? Like,
Basement. Religious. Slave. She's
never done any of this. It’s like
she’s a weird-ass Disney princess
that’s been locked in a tower her
whole life.

(singing The Little

Mermaid)
“She wants to be where the people
are. She wants to see, wants to see
them dancing...”

WILLIAM
Is that true?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 54.

Loray is at the stage of tipsiness in which everything is
hilarious. Paraphrasing Ariel:

LORAY
(still singing)
“She was-- what’s the word--
BURNED? When’s it her tuuurn?”

WILLIAM
I believe the sheltered bit. She’s
definitely confused about certain
customs. Do you know how much money
she tipped me for one drink?

LORAY
She's country, huh? Did she put
pennies on the bar?

WILLIAM
No...

LORAY
Well, don’t complain, because I
didn’t get a tip! She did not tip
me, and I sang. From the heart! I
was an unexpected treat.

Before William can ask any more questions, Lamb returns from
the bar with a soft drink.

LAMB
Would you believe I got this for
free? They said designated drivers
get free pop.

LORAY
What largesse.

Lamb leans against the wall. Though she’s trying to stay
energetic, her body language betrays that she’s SORE and
TIRED. She touches her arm. William notices.

WILLIAM
Do you want to sit down?
LAMB
I’m fine.
(then)

I don’t see any seats, anyway.

The bar is indeed packed, sweaty and seat-less.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 55.

WILLIAM
There’s an upstairs bar. It’s sort
of not open on weeknights, but they
know me here. They don’t care.
Maybe we'll just sit down for a few
minutes.

Lamb considers this cautiously.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Are you scared of me?

LAMB

(yes)
No.

WILLIAM
I'd understand if you were.

LAMB
Why, because you have a leather
jacket and some tattoos? Big deal.
I know ministers who look as
“tough” as you. Punks for Jesus.
Yeah, that’s old news.

WILLIAM
(take aback)
Well, those guys are faking it.
They're using a look to sell
religion.

LAMB
They're playing a part, same as
you. I don’t know what you’re
selling, but I suspect you're as
toothless as they are.

WILLIAM
You're mean, Lamb. I think I’11
just let you suffer.

LAMB
What?

William would never, but he’s very convincing.

WILLIAM
You can stand here throbbing in
pain. I don’t care. Hey, there are
some nice seats in the latrine if
Hepatitis B is on your to-do list.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 56.

LAMB
(emphatic)
Take me upstairs, please.

Everyone turns around, surprised.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE (STAIRWELL) - NIGHT

William gently helps Lamb up the steep bar stairs. She’s
having trouble.

LAMB
Thanks.
(embarrassed)
I get really sore and stiff at
night. I’m just-- I can’t move very
well anymore.

WILLIAM
Me neither, but I don’t have a
cool, tragic excuse. I’ve got a
hundred bucks that says you can
dance better than I can.

As William helps her, we see him discreetly RETURNING THE TIP
she left him, tucking it back into her purse. She doesn’t
notice.

LAMB
Dancing? No. All I can do is sort
of bounce up and down.

WILLIAM
There’s nothing wrong with that.
All dancing is just a prelude to
bouncing anyway, right?

He winks.

LAMB
(tight-lipped)
Mm-hm.

Lamb’s not sure why she’s following this guy upstairs, but
it’s too late to turn back.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE (UPSTAIRS BAR) - NIGHT

William unhooks a rope blocking the entrance. The upstairs
bar is a quiet, empty room with an old-school big screen TV,
a Christmas tree, and plenty of seating. Lamb and William sit
down at a high-top table.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 57.

There’s a row of PAPER CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS tacked to the wall
with EMPLOYEES’ names on them.

LAMB
Oh, stockings for the people who
work here. That must be so fun.

William can’t help but smile at Lamb’s wistful enthusiasm for
everyday things.

LAMB (CONT'D)
You don’t have anything to drink.

WILLIAM
I don’t drink.

LAMB
Like me.

WILLIAM

Not even a little.

(then)
I don’t drink anymore. I had some
problems with, ah, substances, and
the sale thereof.

(beat)
Did some time. In prison.

LAMB
Oh.

Lamb opens her purse, looking for something. She pulls out
the FLIER advertising “Ryder,” the prostitute. Her face falls
as she looks at the image.

WILLIAM
What is it?

LAMB
I got this on the street.

She shows him solemnly, as if it’s a rare, horrible artifact.

WILLIAM
Oh. Yeah, you always see these on
the Strip. Kind of grim, I guess.

LAMB
I can’t stop thinking about her. I
wish I could find her. She must be
so scared, don’t you think?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 58.

WILLIAM
Ah, this isn’t even a real girl.
These places use fake, misleading
pictures.
(then)
I hear.

LAMB
The picture might be fake, and the
name might be fake, but if you dial
this number, a real human being
shows up.

William scans the flier.

WILLIAM
She does in-call as well.
That means you can also come
to her...

LAMB
(interrupting)
I’m worried about her.

William, jaded, can’t believe how idealistic this girl is.

WILLIAM
You can’t just go around saving
people. Trying to do that here is
like that arcade game, you know,
with the little mallet? You put one
devil down, another one’s just
gonna pop up.

LAMB
My religion
(catching herself)
Well, I’m an atheist now, but my
former religion says if you can
save one soul, you can save the
world.

Lamb is rummaging in her purse. She takes out her VICODIN
BOTTLE and opens it. She shakes out three pills. Shakes
again. NOTHING LEFT.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Oh no. Oh gosh.

WILLIAM
What is it?

Lamb is panicking.
59.

LAMB
Some of my pills are missing. I
need these.

WILLIAM
No worries. You probably have,
like, unlimited refills right?

LAMB
Somebody stole from me. They stole
medication from a burn survivor.
(then)
Do you think Loray would take it?

William’s guilt is suddenly compounded.

WILLIAM
No. Loray wouldn’t do that.

LAMB
I don’t know her.

WILLIAM

Oh. No. She’s so good, Lamb. She’s
a deeply good person. She loves the
Beach Boys.

(serious)
I’ve worked with her for four
years; she’s like my sister. She’s
my pit wife. Please don’t even
think for a second it was Loray.
You have enough for now, right?
There’s a bunch of 24-hour
pharmacies right around here. I'll
drive you.

LAMB
Okay.

The mood has changed. Lamb swallows one of her remaining
Vicodins as William looks around for something, anything, to
cheer her up. He glances at the big TV.

WILLIAM
Hey, you wanna see if there’s a
silly movie on or something?

LAMB
(dejected)
Sure.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 60.

INT. SCEPTRE BAR (DOWNSTAIRS) - SAME

Loray is grinding with a HEAVILY BEARDED GUY. She takes a
swig of beer and tries unsuccessfully to make out with him
through his mass of facial hair.

LORAY
I can’t find your mouth.

INT. SCEPTRE LOUNGE (UPSTAIRS BAR) - SAME

William takes a remote from behind the bar and turns on the
big TV. He flips through the channels and finds...

The classic 1960s special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
Lamb reacts like a delighted child.

LAMB
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer! I
remember this.

William watches with her, equally pleased. The light flickers
on their faces.

WILLIAM
Of course. Total classic. Even I’ve
seen this and my childhood was a
blur of beatings and evictions.

LAMB
I watched this like, every year
when I was little. Then my parents
realized it left the Christ out of
Christmas, and that was the end of
that.

They watch for a moment. It’s the “Island of Misfit Toys”
sequence, in which a haunting song is sung by imperfect toys:
a polka-dotted elephant, a boat that doesn’t float, a train
with square wheels, and a lonely little rag doll (among
others).

LAMB (CONT'D)
Oh, this part is so sad. These are
the Misfit Toys. Nobody wants them
because they’re defective.

ELEPHANT
(on TV)
How'd you like to be a spotted
elephant?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 61.

BOAT
(onscreen)
Or a boat that can't float?

Lamb watches, her eyes shining. Then:

WILLIAM
What’s wrong with the doll?

LAMB
I don’t know. Nobody wants her.

WILLIAM
Seriously, though, what’s her
defect? I can see the train has
square wheels. And the elephant has
polka-dots. But that little doll
looks completely normal. What’s she
doing with those broken toys?

We see the rag doll. She does look perfectly normal. (This is
one thing that has never made sense about the “Misfit Toys”
scene.)

LAMB
We probably just can’t see what’s
wrong with her.

WILLIAM
You think it’s under her dress or
something?

Lamb is uncomfortable. Her voice is strained.

LAMB
Yeah.
WILLIAM
Or...maybe she’s perfect.
LAMB
Nah.
WILLIAM
Maybe she’s just in the wrong
place.

Loray emerges from the stairwell, interrupting them. She
glances at the TV, drunk and dismissive.

LORAY
What is this? Gumby?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 62.

William and Lamb groan at Loray’s flippancy toward such a
beloved show.

WILLIAM
You don’t know what this is?

LORAY
You guys need to come downstairs
immediately. Some people are line
dancing as a joke.

William fakes jumping out of his seat. Then:

WILLIAM
She needs to rest.

LAMB
No, I’m fine now. Much better.

They rise and head toward the stairwell. Loray continues
babbling happily.

LORAY
Hey William, you know that girl who
always does the splits? She did it
again. I'm like, bitch, we get it,
you can put your whole vagina on
the floor.

WILLIAM
Okay.

LORAY
I’m gonna fight her.

WILLIAM
I think it’s time to switch
to water.

Loray takes a last glance at the TV and shakes her head as
they descend. She loudly whispers to William.

LORAY (0.S.)
You take a girl upstairs and you
put on cartoons? You’re a mess.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Lamb, William and Loray walk down Fremont Street, eating HOT
DOGS from a busy food truck.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 63.

LORAY
So is dirty street meat against
your religion?

Lamb is enjoying her hot dog immensely.

LAMB
I think it could be my religion.

CHARLIE, the CUTE GIRL BARTENDER suddenly rushes up to Lamb,
still wearing her bar apron.

CHARLIE
(breathless)
Hey, thank you so much for that
tip. Wow. I just wanted to say
thanks before you take off. I
really appreciate it.

LAMB
No problem.

CHARLIE
I can go to Burning Man now!

LAMB
Great.

Charlie, grinning, runs back into the bar. William realizes
Lamb has left another massive tip, but shrugs it off as
typical weirdness.

LORAY
What was that all about?

LAMB
I’m really not sure.

A beat as they walk. William changes the subject, ticking
Lamb's “crimes” off on his fingers.

WILLIAM
So. You gambled, you drank, you
danced with-- what did you call
them, Sodomites?

LAMB

Yes. I failed at all three tasks.
WILLIAM

You watched a movie with Santa

Claus.
(redneck drawl)
(MORE )
64.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
You're wearin’ anti-Amurrican
clothing.

He flicks at the fringe on Lamb's scarf.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
What are you going to do next?

LORAY
She needs to get turned out.

LAMB
Hm?

William shoots an annoyed look at Loray.

LORAY
What? Don’t tell me “sins of the
flesh” aren’t part of the agenda.
It should be right there in your
little Sanrio day planner: GET
LAID. What else is there? At least
you have to do something dirty.

LAMB
(flustered)
Okay. Well. Okay then. Let’s
go...see...Goddess.

LORAY
What's Goddess?

Lamb is already blushing before she even describes it.

LAMB

You know. The adults-only show?
With the topless girls and the
volcanoes?

(sighing)
You know, where Nomi performs in
Showgirls? I know the Stardust
isn’t there anymore, but maybe they
moved the show to a different
venue.

Loray bursts out laughing.

LORAY
Lamb, Showgirls is not real. Okay?
It is not a documentary about Las
Vegas. It is fiction. It came out
of a horny Dutch man’s imagination.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 65.

LAMB
I know! I just thought maybe
Goddess was real. The character of
Nomi, she makes such a big deal
about being in it.

WILLIAM
That’s perfectly understandable. I
thought it was real myself.

LORAY
(dying)
William, you did not.

WILLIAM
I did. I’ve looked for it. Checked
every marquee.

LAMB
All right, I’m an idiot. I'ma
gullible idiot from the prairie.
Where do we go next, then?

LORAY
Back to Paradise, baby!

LAMB
I thought we hated Paradise. I
thought Paradise was processed
cheese and dumb fountains,
etcetera.

WILLIAM
After hours is when the employees
come out to play.

LORAY
We know everyone, and everyone
loves us. We can go wherever we
want and our money is no good.

LAMB
Um, I sort of need to find a
pharmacy first. I take medication.
For my pain. And somebody stole
most of it.

Loray glances at William. A COLD, DISAPPOINTED GLANCE, but
brief enough that Lamb doesn’t notice. Lamb turns to Loray.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Do you think it could be one of
your friends?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 66.

LORAY
(sadly)
Possibly.

WILLIAM
I’ll take you, Lamb. Loray, come
on. I don’t want you driving.

LORAY
It’s fine. I’1l get a cab.
(accusingly)
You take her to the drug store,
William. I’1l catch you later.

She begins to walk away from them rather suddenly.

WILLIAM
You sure?

LORAY
Yeah, yeah, I need some breathing
room. It’s like shawarma and liquor
are having a UFC fight in my
stomach. I’1ll see you guys on
the Strip.

WILLIAM
Okay.

Lamb, high on life and being “cool”, flashes the peace sign.

LAMB
Later! Peace out.

Loray rolls her eyes.

EXT. WALGREENS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

William waits behind the wheel of his TOYOTA. Lamb runs out
of the 24-hour Walgreens clutching a PAPER BAG from the
pharmacy. She slides into the front seat cheerfully.

LAMB
Phew. That wasn’t so hard. They had
it right there in the computer.

He watches her gobble down a couple of pills with a bit too
much enthusiasm.

WILLIAM
Good, great.
(then)
(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 67.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Hey, can I ask you a sensitive
question?

LAMB
Yes?

WILLIAM
You know that prescription pain
killers are extremely addictive,
right?

LAMB
I have very serious injuries.

WILLIAM
No. I know. I know. I’m just saying
that this is, sadly, my area of
expertise. I happen to know that
certain controlled substances, such
as this one, can cause a
dependency. Even when people don’t
set out to abuse them.

Lamb is crumpling the bag irritably.

LAMB
I know all this. I spent six months
in a hospital. I’m not some pill-
abusing druggie criminal like the
people you might know from “the
joint.”

WILLIAM
Lamb.

She sees how serious he is.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
It’s not something a person can
always help. Even if they’re the
most well-meaning, most
responsible, nicest, loveliest
person in the world and they’re
named after a baby farm animal.

Lamb looks away.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
I know people who’ve been so hooked
on that stuff that they’d do
anything to get it. Gross things.
Really bad things, not fake-fun-bad
like what you’re doing here.
68.

LAMB
Look, I know you guys think what
I’m doing here is so funny, but you
have no idea how serious it is to
me. Being here tonight goes against
every belief that’s been instilled
in me. It’s like bending a bone
backwards. I’m trying to smile and
have fun and let go, but I feel
like I’m going to snap.

WILLIAM
If it makes you feel better, it’s
not just you. Everyone who comes to
Vegas is testing the tensile
strength of their conscience.

LAMB
Well, when does it get fun? I just
want to have fun. How is this
something people enjoy? Bars aren't
fun. That bar smelled like the flu.
And that dumb slot machine wasn’t
fun. It took my money and just said
“bar.” Great, I just paid ten
dollars for a machine to tell me
where I am. It’s not fun, William.
I just want to do something that’s
fun for me.

William considers what might be fun for Lamb.
WILLIAM
Hm.
EXT. MANHATTAN EXPRESS ROLLER COASTER (TO ESTABLISH) - NIGHT

The huge ROLLER COASTER looms over the Strip.

INT. NEW YORK NEW YORK HOTEL (ROLLER COASTER) - NIGHT

Lamb, William and Loray wait in line for the roller coaster.
Loray’s arms are crossed and she’s pissed off. Lamb, however,
looks THRILLED.

LAMB
Now this is wild and crazy, you
guys!

WILLIAM

(humoring her)
I know.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 69.

LAMB
They didn’t have a roller coaster
at Creation Land. I’ve never been
on one. Aren’t you guys excited?

LORAY
No.

LAMB
Loray, I think you might be Type D.

LORAY
What the hell is Type D?

LAMB
You don’t know? It means depressed.

LORAY
Maybe it’s just late on a Monday
and I’m tired of being your magical

negro.

LAMB
What?

WILLIAM
Oh, boy.

LORAY

The “magical negro” is, uh, a
narrative convention in which a
black person uses their special
black wisdom to help a dumb white
person. We learned all about it in
film school. Ghost, Green Mile,
Bagger Vance. All magical negroes.

WILLIAM
Except you're not wise or magical.

Loray burps.

LORAY
Yes I am! Lamb, don’t I say a lot
of things that make you go, “Wow,
Loray just told me! She’s so
insightful.”

LAMB
Yes.

LORAY
That's extremely racist.
70.

LAMB
I’m sorry.

WILLIAM
(to Loray)
Let’s face it. You’re no
Bagger Vance.

LORAY
Shut up.

WILLIAM
Bagger Vance is immortal. He
doesn’t age.

LORAY
No, that’s just what Will Smith
looks like.

WILLIAM

No, the character didn’t age.

LAMB
What was the right answer? What was
I supposed to say.

William tries to put a friendly arm around Loray, but she
shrugs him off, annoyed. Now we can see she’s REALLY MAD, and
not about the Bagger Vance thing.

INT. ROLLER COASTER PLATFORM - NIGHT

William, Lamb and Loray stand behind the automated airgates
as the COASTER TRAIN arrives in the station.

WILLIAM
Look, Lamb. There’s a spot open at
the front. Take it.

Lamb hesitates, peering at the front car.

LAMB
But then I have to sit next to a
strange man in a cowboy outfit.

WILLIAM
This is your first ride. You gotta
have the front so you can feel the
bugs hit your teeth.

Lamb looks again at her fellow passenger.
71.

LAMB
The cowboy outfit has no...behind
part.

LORAY

Aw. Baby’s first assless chaps.
Don’t worry. You don’t have to talk
to him. Git.

Lamb boldly jogs to the front of the coaster train. The
airgates open. Loray is stuck riding with William. She looks
away as they climb into the train and pull down the
restraints.

WILLIAM
Why are you mad at me?

LORAY
You know why.

The roller coaster lurches out of the station.

WILLIAM
Don’t be like this.

LORAY
It’s bad enough that you stole pain
relief from a girl who’s held
together with bandages and chewing
gum. But it’s even worse that
you're up her ass all night. The
whole “white knight” routine you
do. Helping her up that dark
stairwell. Bringing her here-- you
know we’re never caught dead doing
this tacky shit! And you’re
flirting with her. Making her feel
pretty. It’s cruel.

WILLIAM
She is pretty.

LORAY
Obviously, yes, but she’s pretty
like the Playboy Mansion. Looks
like a dream, but you don’t want to
pull up the carpet.

The coaster ascends the lift hill.

LORAY (CONT'D)
Why are you here?
72.

WILLIAM
(defensive)
I don’t know, I felt like it
tonight. My sponsor says I can’t
stay in forever and I thought it
was time.

LORAY
Time. I bet it’s time. You’re here
because you found a blonde virgin
with a purse full of dope.

WILLIAM
Lor, I have not broken any
promises. I’ve been staying out of
trouble.

LORAY
“Trouble” is up there next to the
naked cowboy, and you’re acting
like you'd rather get in it.

WILLIAM
I know this is hard to believe,
coming from me. But I would never
take advantage of her.

LORAY
Ha. Yes, it is hard to believe
coming from you. The man they call
“William the Conqueror.” “Fill’em
Will’em.” “Bill the Butcher”...

WILLIAM
Loray, I would never. Not her. I
wouldn’t take that from her.

LORAY
Didn't you already take something
from her?

A moment of silence. Loray looks off toward the side of the
lift hill. They’re almost 200 feet above the Strip.

William reaches for Loray’s hand. She’s confused for a
moment. When William lets go, Loray opens her palm. He’s
surreptitiously handed her FOURTEEN VICODIN PILLS.

WILLIAM
They're all there. I didn’t
take a single one. I mean, yes, I
took them out of her purse about
four minutes after I met her. But I
didn’t take them.

(MORE )
73.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
I’ve thought about them nonstop
since they’ve come into my
possession, but I haven’t taken
one.

There’s a moment of relieved silence for Loray. Then:

LORAY
What do you expect me to do with
these? You know I prefer crack.

WILLIAM
I don’t know. We'll give them back
to her and she’1l hate me and I’1l1
have a pathetic story for my next
NA meeting.

LORAY
No. I like how she looks at you.
She looks at you like you’re a good
person and not a total jagoff.

WILLIAM
I know. But I can’t let her think
you stole it.

LORAY
I don’t care. Let’s protect her
from something. She’s gotta hang on
to some of that sweetness.

As the train crests the lift hill, Loray tosses the handful
of tiny white pills over the side.

WILLIAM
What are you doing?

Loray does her best meterologist impression.
LORAY
Tonight’s Clark County forecast
calls for scattered flurries.

William watches the pills disappear.

WILLIAM
Merry Christmas, assholes.

LORAY
Open your damn mouths!

The train PLUNGES into the roller coaster’s spaghetti-like
mass of steel track.
74.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT
Lamb's head is hanging between her knees.

WILLIAM
Hey. Hey. You going to be okay?

They're standing on the still-busy sidewalk. Lamb downplays
her nausea and discomfort.

LAMB
Yes. I’m phenomenal.

She stands up. We see a spot of BLOOD on the elbow of her
cardigan.

LORAY
You're bleeding.

LAMB
(downplaying)
I think I bumped my elbow going
around one of those turns.

William pulls up the sleeve of the cardigan. Lamb recoils
from this violation of privacy.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Stop it.

The elbow of Lamb’s compression garment is SOAKED in blood.
Loray winces and looks away.

WILLIAM
You're hurt.

LAMB
It’s my skin graft.

William is trying to stay calm.

WILLIAM
Can they re-graft it?

Lamb pulls away from him angrily.

LAMB
Yeah, at a special clinic in
Minnesota for human-jerky. I TOLD
you I was a mess. I told you.
Nobody ever believes me.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

WILLIAM
You're not a mess. It’s not a big
deal. You just need to take it
easy. Chill at the hotel.

LAMB
Chill? I’m tired of “taking it
easy.” I’ve been taking it easy for
two years now and I feel like I’m
rotting alive.

LORAY
From a scientific standpoint, we’re
all rotting alive.

LAMB
My gosh, I never thought about it
that way. You’re so wise.

On Loray: OWNED.

WILLIAM
I think you’ve had enough fun for
the night. We need to patch you up.

Lamb is clutching her bleeding elbow.

LAMB
Enough fun my skinless ass! It’s
easy for you to say “enough” and to
“take it easy”, because you already
got to do everything you wanted.
You already got to screw up and
disappoint your whole family.

On William: sadly, this is true.

LAMB (CONT'D)

You've got those lines on your face
and that silver in your hair
because you lived. Now it’s my

turn.

WILLIAM
I'm a dirtbag. You don’t want to be
like me.

LAMB

(through tears)
Yes I do.
76.

LORAY
You're lucky you had a nice life. I
know you resent all the Jesus stuff
and not being allowed to wear
shorts and the fact that they made
you practice the recorder
every day.

LAMB
The flute.

LORAY
But there are worse things than
being protected. Having someone
care where you go and what happens
to you.

We can see that Loray has wished for this very thing. William
glances at her protectively.

LORAY (CONT'D)

People in your family are probably
looking for you right now. Nobody's
looked for me in years. The last
time someone Googled me, there was
no Google. They had to Alta Vista
that shit.

Lamb looks up at Loray, still holding her elbow.

LORAY (CONT'D)

Also, I’m not the one bleeding on
the street right now. You've lived,
all right? All right, plane crash?
You lived, you died, and now you’re
living again. You’re a lot harder
than most of these clowns.

She gestures to the LATE NIGHT REVELERS on the street.

WILLIAM
Let’s get you to the hospital.

LAMB
Don’t bother. They’1l just wrap it
in some gauze and parade me around
in front of the med students. I
hate when people treat me like I’m
some kind of curiosity.

Loray glances at William. Guilty.
77.

LAMB (CONT'D)
I’m just going to go back to my
hotel.

WILLIAM
You're not going alone.

LAMB
Why not? I took a taxi from the
airport. I know what I’m doing.

LORAY
Let William take you back.

William looks at Loray, surprised. Loray nods.

LORAY (CONT'D)
He’s the best guy when you need
taking care of. Once I got food
poisoning at work and he guarded
the door to the women’s bathroom
for six hours.

William smiles at this awful-yet-touching memory.
LORAY (CONT'D)
He’s not perfect. I’1l tell you no
lies. But he’1ll get you home in one
piece. Or whatever pieces you've
got left.
Lamb giggles through the pain.

LORAY (CONT'D)
You can trust him.

With that, she extends her blessing. William’s gratitude is
evident. Loray’s RESPECT means a lot to him.

Lamb considers it.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP (CORNER) - NIGHT

William flags a CAB. Loray waits with Lamb on the sidewalk. A
taxi appears and pulls up to the curb.

William gives Loray a friendly hug and a peck.
WILLIAM

(to Loray)
Good night, sweetie.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 78.

LORAY
See you in the pit.

William gestures for Lamb to enter the cab. She hesitates.

LAMB
You go ahead. I want to say goodbye
to Loray.

William shrugs and hops in, leaving Loray and Lamb on the
sidewalk.

LAMB (CONT'D)
It was truly a pleasure to
meet you. I know our time together
was short, but I valued it.

LORAY
It was something meeting you, too.
(then)
Hey, look, I’m sorry I teased you
about all that sex stuff. I could
tell it upset you. It was pretty
insensitive of me.

LAMB
Oh, sheesh, it’s fine. It’s not
like I’m a virgin.

LORAY
Uh, what?

Lamb is shockingly casual.

LAMB

I’ve had sex. Of course.

(explaining)
I had sexual relations with Pastor
Rick, or just “Rick” as he asked me
to call him during that fateful
youth retreat. I’d been attracted
to him for a while and I succumbed
to baser urges. Looking back, I can
see that it was an abuse of power
on his part, but what’s done is
done...

Loray’s like what the fuck?

LAMB (CONT'D)
Don’t tell me you’re surprised. You
think fundamentalist Christians
don’t have sex?

(MORE )
79.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Ha, everyone has sex. It’s the one
thing they haven’t figured out how
to control.

LORAY
I just thought...

LAMB
Even the church leaders do it.
Sometimes they get caught with
other men, even! Don’t you read the
news?

She hops into the cab, shrugging cheerfully despite her
injury.

Loray prevents her from shutting the car door.

LORAY
Wait. What’s going to happen to
you?

LAMB

You don’t care.

LORAY
Let’s pretend I do.

LAMB
I don’t know.

LORAY
Well, I know you think Las Vegas
was kind of a bust. But this is all
make-believe. It’s fake, like
Goddess.

Lamb smiles.
LORAY (CONT'D)
If you still want to be a regular
American, like you said?

Lamb nods.

LORAY (CONT'D)
I think you need to go see America.

Lamb takes in this advice. Then:

LAMB
Hey, you know how you said no one
ever came looking for you? That
nobody cares where you are?
80.

LORAY
Yeah?

LAMB
Well, I followed you into the
bathroom. And then I followed you
downtown and, well, I gotta say...
more people should come looking for
you. They’d find some amazing
things.

Lamb reaches, painfully, to shut the CAB DOOR. Loray
intercepts, closing it gently and waving goodbye to her
“Disney princess.”

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD - LOBBY

William and Lamb enter the lobby. William is holding Lamb’s
injured elbow. They look cozy.

Yet another group of adorable young COLLEGE GIRLS walks by.
They're not “bad girls” ; they’re just having the time of
their life. They carry drinks and laugh. Lamb watches them
enviously. This is the normal life she dreams of.

Three of them cluster together for a photo while one holds up
her camera phone.

GIRL WITH CAMERA
Say it with me, guys...1-2-3...
(everyone together)
Phenom-enal!

Lamb turns to William suddenly.

LAMB
Where do you think they’re going?

William is dismissive. Derisive, even.

WILLIAM
I don’t know. There’s a nightclub
at this hotel that all the
“Trixies” and “Chads” seem to love.
They're probably going there.

LAMB
I want to go to the club.

WILLIAM
I don’t think that’s one of the
recommended steps in wound care.
81.

LAMB
Just for a minute. Just for one
minute so I can see.

WILLIAM
It’s not you. It’s loud and crowded
and it’s full of disgusting
aggressive people who will try to
put their...private parts...against
your...rear end.

LAMB
You don’t have to mince words
around me, William. You can say
butt. Look, I said “butt” and hell
didn’t swallow me up.

A crying BRIDE stomps past, holding up her soiled hem.

WILLIAM
You sure about that?

LAMB
Let's go.

WILLIAM
Okay.

LAMB
(surprised)
Okay? Okay!

She clutches her elbow in pain, grinning.

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD HOTEL (CLUB ENTRANCE) - NIGHT

A long line of CLUBGOERS snakes out of a huge, high-concept
Vegas hotel nightclub.

William moves easily to the front of the line, exchanges
pleasantries with the DOOR GUY, and ushers Lamb in.

INT. CLUB - NIGHT

The interior of the club is a dark labyrinth. There are
beautiful half-naked GIRLS dancing everywhere in Eden-themed
fig leaf ensembles. The music is bone-jarringly loud.

Lamb keeps one hand on William’s shoulder as he cuts through
the crowd. She’s never seen this many people crammed into one
place.
82.

They finally emerge at the CENTER OF THE CLUB. It’s the time
of night when drunk and drugged people completely lose their
minds. It’s so loud that William can’t speak to Lamb, and
vice versa. He simply gestures as if to say, “Here we are.”

Lamb's expression is hard to read. Her face is solemn. There
are CLUB KIDS going wild all around them. Lamb is surrounded
by mayhem and indecency. William is concerned. Has he gone
too far?

A TINSEL CANNON goes off, spewing silver tinsel into the air.
It pours down on the cheering crowd.

Lamb can’t move, but she smiles. She starts laughing. It’s
the happiest William has seen her.

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD HOTEL - ELEVATOR

Lamb and William are standing in the corner of an OPEN
ELEVATOR, about to ride up to her floor. Lamb’s hair is full
of tinsel.

Suddenly, two of the FRAT GUYS we saw when Lamb first arrived
run to make the elevator. One shoves his hand between the
closing doors; they both hop in. Their eyes are bloodshot;
they're clearly messed up on some kind of disco biscuits.

LAMB
Hi, guys!

The two GUYS freeze, horrified.

FRAT GUY #1
(under his breath)
Oh shit, it’s the narc. It’s the
narc, man!

LAMB
No, silly, narcs report to me. I’m
a fed, remember?

The guys back away.

LAMB (CONT'D)
This is my partner, Officer Cha.

William plays along flawlessly.

WILLIAM
Good evening, boys. Or should I
say, good morning! My, you seem
wide awake at such a wee hour.
83.

FRAT GUY #1
(twitching)
We drank a lot of coffee. Energy
drinks.

WILLIAM
Energy drinks.

LAMB
Your pupils are unusually large. I
better get my eye flashlight.

The frat guys are wildly stabbing the “open door” button.

WILLIAM
Very strange indeed, Officer
Krupke. Say, do you mind if I ask
where you purchased those drinks?

FRAT GUY #2
We have to go.

The two guys dash off the elevator. William looks at Lamb,
amused.

WILLIAM
How long have you been here?

LAMB
Only a few hours, I swear.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - 3:00 A.M.

Lamb and William enter Lamb’s suite. William is surprised by
its size.

WILLIAM
This is some room. Did they comp
you or something?

LAMB
I had a coupon.

This seems an unlikely explanation, but William lets it go.

LAMB (CONT'D)
I was planning to stay here for
a while anyway.

William looks around the immaculate suite. He sees Lamb's
clothing. Her Obama book. Her flute in its case. Then he sees
Lamb's DISHES sitting in a neat stack.
84.

WILLIAM
What’s with the dishes?

Lamb sighs.

LAMB

I brought my own dishes from home.
I don’t know why people find this
so strange!

(exasperated)
I had to let go of a lot of
prejudices and fears to come to Las
Vegas, so I don’t know why it’s
such a big deal that I’d want to
have my own tableware. I should
have something familiar. Hotels are
notoriously dirty.

WILLIAM
It’s fine. I was just wondering.
You know, hotel comforters are
supposed to be the worst.

Lamb eyes the patterned BEDSPREAD warily.

LAMB
Really?

WILLIAM
Yeah, they don’t wash them and
they’re allegedly covered in se...
(correcting himself)
Cigar...ette ash.

LAMB
Should I take it off?

WILLIAM
Sure.

Lamb pulls the comforter off the bed and onto the floor.
There’s something awkward about discussing the bed.

LAMB
You didn’t have to come all the way
to my room. I could have found my
way up from the lobby.

WILLIAM
I see that you can take care of
yourself. You’d already used some
kind of mind trick on those bros in
the elevator.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 85.

LAMB
Well, that’s a bit like hypnotizing
chickens.
(off his blank look)
Easy.

William sits down on the DESK CHAIR.

WILLIAM
So when you said you'd be staying
here for a while, how long did you
mean?

LAMB
I don’t know. I just don’t want to
go back to Billings.

WILLIAM
There are other places on the good-
times continuum between Billings
and the Vegas Strip.

LAMB
I'm figuring that out.

WILLIAM
Hm. You know, I think you'd love
Chicago.

LAMB
Where are you from?

WILLIAM
Chicago.

Lamb smiles.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
Since I’m never going to see you
again, you should know-- you have a
right to know-- that I’m the one
who stole your Vicodin. I fished
them right out of your bag.

LAMB
Abhh...

We think she’s going to protest.

LAMB (CONT'D)
.--bviously.

WILLIAM
How did you know that?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 86.

LAMB
I left my purse with you and you're
a recovering drug addict. My mom
always says that when people tell
you who they are, you should
listen.

William nods: fair enough.

LAMB (CONT'D)
I mean, I understand. I’m not
without my vices. I’m totally
addicted to-- well, you know those
vanilla sandwich cookies, with the
creme filling? I love them. If you
had a big bag of those cookies,
boy, when you weren’t looking? I'd
eat a couple. Maybe I’d eat 10. My
flesh is weak.

She’s anything but weak, and William knows that.

WILLIAM
I doubt that.

LAMB
No, I’1l admit it. I love vanilla
sandwich cookies.
(quietly, almost
whispering)
And also Vicodin.

WILLIAM
What?

Lamb whispers again, this time closer to him. He nods.

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
I think you can get the situation
under control. The cookies, I mean.

Lamb looks worried and self-conscious. Obviously, he’s not
talking about the cookies.

LAMB
I don’t know.

WILLIAM
If you need help, there are lots of
counselors that specialize in creme-
filled desserts. No big whoop. But
personally? I think there probably
isn’t anything you can’t do.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 87.

LAMB
William, I mean no offense. But are
you trying to get into my surgical
support hose?

WILLIAM
No. This is not to say I wouldn't.
I would.

Lamb blushes.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
I would! I love support hose. I
would peel ‘em right off. Throw
them around my head like a lasso.

Lamb bursts out laughing despite being totally scandalized.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)
I think I should go. I understand
if you don’t want to exchange email
or whatever. Or regular addresses.
You do live on a street, right?

LAMB
Rural Route 13. And don’t go.
WILLIAM
(surprised)
What?
LAMB
Don't go.
WILLIAM

I lied to you. I’m a liar and an
addict Just another Vegas lost
cause. Why do you keep trusting me?

LAMB
It’s a very potent act to put your
faith in someone who’s lost their
faith in themselves.

WILLIAM
Yeah, I guess it is.

Lamb seems to have an epiphany.
LAMB

Will you help me with something
that might seem weird?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 88.

WILLIAM
What have we been doing all night?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - 3:30 A.M.

Lamb sits on her bed and picks up the ROOM PHONE. We can’t
see who she’s calling. William lingers supportively.

LAMB (ON PHONE)
Hi. I have a question. My name is
Lamb.
(calmly)
No, actually I am not a prostitute.

EXT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB - 4:00 A.M.

Dusk approaches. Lamb, still in her bloodied cardigan and
jeans, approaches the cheesy, neo-Classical facade of the
CHEETAH GENTLEMAN'S CLUB. William is apprehensive about this
plan.

WILLIAM
I’m going in with you, of course.

LAMB
Certainly not. I have to go alone.

WILLIAM
What? I’m coming in!

LAMB
You can’t do that.

WILLIAM
Why? Is this a religious thing? You
don’t trust me, do you? I don’t
blame you if you don’t.

LAMB
(interrupting)
I trust you! It’s just that I will
die of embarrassment if I have to
enter this temple of Jezebel with a
guy that I like!

WILLIAM
Oh.
(pleased)
Oh.
89.

Lamb walks toward the club. She offers the COVER CHARGE to
one of the two BOUNCERS. He waves her in wordlessly. She
looks small and vulnerable as she ducks through the doorway.

BOUNCER #1
I gotta call my daughter.

INT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB - SAME

Lamb enters. The vibe at a strip club at 4:00 AM is a strange
one. Some of the GIRLS are cashing out. There are girls
onstage, girls leaving. Lamb scans the room.

A baby-faced, Michael Cera-esque MANAGER approaches her.

MANAGER
Hi, do you need an application?

A STRIPPER in a dowdy PUFFER COAT, Uggs and a Chicago Bears
hat heads for the door, counting a wad of bills.

MANAGER (CONT'D)
Justice? What did I say about no
street clothes on the work floor?

JUSTICE
Sorry, Bernard.

She saunters out of the club, rolling her eyes.

MANAGER
It really ruins the illusion.
Thanks.
(to Lamb)
Sorry. Hi.

LAMB
I’m looking for someone.

The manager sighs.

MANAGER
Are you hear to make trouble?
Collect a real or imagined debt?
Choke a bitch out?

Lamb reaches into her purse and slips a BILL into the
manager’s hand. She shakes it firmly.

LAMB
Peace be with you.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 90.

MANAGER
Oh. Merry Christmas.
(looking at the bill)
Please enjoy the club.

INT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB (MAIN FLOOR) - SAME

Lamb crosses the club floor. It’s a sad place that masks its
sadness with colorful lights and thumping music.

Lamb looks at one of the dancers and realizes: it’s STRIPPER
#3 from the airport baggage claim. The girl meets Lamb’s
gaze; she recognizes her, vaguely, but is too fucked up on
something or other to register much.

Lamb waves and continues across the floor. She follows two
GIRLS up a STAIRWAY and through an open door.

INT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB (DRESSING ROOM) - SAME

Lamb cautiously enters the large, grimy DRESSING ROOM. She
brightens immediately. She’s found the person she was looking
for: A tired BRUNETTE in her mid-thirties, checking her
makeup in the mirror. She wears a Santa Claus bikini.

LAMB
Hello. Are you Ryder?

“Ryder” has to think about that one.

RYDER
Huh? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I’m Ryder.
What do you want?

She looks around as if expecting some kind of ambush. Lamb
holds up a familiar, crumpled yellow paper.

LAMB
I called the number on the flier.

Ryder takes a plastic BRUSH out of her purse and begins
brushing the matted ends of her hair extensions.

RYDER
I’m not working tonight.

Lamb begins picking soiled COSTUMES and DRESSES up off the
floor. She brushes them off and starts hanging them neatly on
a nearby rack.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 91.

LAMB
I know. The agency told me. I asked
where I could find you, and they
said you dance here.

RYDER
They're not supposed to give out
that information.

Lamb folds a bikini bottom and sets it on the counter.
LAMB
I know. I’m afraid I lied. I told
them I was your babysitter and
there was an emergency.

Ryder bristles, alarmed.

RYDER

How do you know about my kids?
LAMB

I don’t.
RYDER

Did a guy put you up to this or
something? I can do couples, but it
costs extra.

LAMB
Oh no, it’s just me.

Lamb picks up a can of DISINFECTANT and sprays it liberally
all over the room.

RYDER
Why are you cleaning?

LAMB
I just like things to be nice.

Ryder is straddling the nasty old “boudoir” chair in her
thin bikini bottoms.

RYDER
I get it. I’m weird about germs
too.
(Somehow, we doubt this.)

A prolonged silence. Then:
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 92.

RYDER (CONT'D)
I’m supposed to be in the Jell-o
pit in ten minutes.

LAMB
I'd like to pay you for your time.
Is there somewhere we can speak
privately.

INT. STRIP CLUB (JACUZZI) - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
Lamb and Ryder soak their feet in a nasty old Jacuzzi in the

strip club dressing room. Lamb’s SUPPORT HOSE are off. The
water bubbles around their ankles.

LAMB
So this is nice!
RYDER
(not really)
Yeah.
LAMB

Okay, here's the thing: I’ma
Christian. And a big part of that,
at least ideally, is reaching out
to people. Where there is charity,
there is God.

Ryder has been proselytized at before.

RYDER
Oh no. No offense, but I hate all
that religious stuff.

LAMB
Wait. Listen, I know what it’s like
to not believe in anything. You see
my scars?

RYDER
Yeah. No offense, that’s busted.

LAMB
I was in a plane that went down.
The boy who was courting me-- my
boyfriend, I guess you would call
him-- he was a pilot in the Air
Force. It was our first date
without a chaperone, and he decided
to take me up. He was very
experienced, but...
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 93.

RYDER
Did he get as messed up as you?

Lamb smiles. The Jacuzzi shuts off and the water stagnates.

LAMB
He got lucky.

RYDER
Not a scratch, huh?

LAMB
No, he died.

This matter-of-fact statement reveals how truly difficult
Lamb’s recovery has been.

RYDER
Hard to believe in God after that.

LAMB
You said it, Ryder! That’s been my
whole crisis. My cross to bear if
you'll pardon the expression. I
know you don’t like “religious
stuff.”

RYDER
S'fine.

LAMB
But if that hadn’t happened- the
pain, the operations, the skin
grafts, everything-- I wouldn’t
have been able to come here. I
wouldn’t have come to this
incredibly spiritual city. I
wouldn't have made new friends that
I couldn’t have found anywhere else
in the world. I wouldn’t have met
William...

RYDER
(interrupting)
You think Vegas is spiri-chall?

LAMB
Technically, this is Paradise.

RYDER
Whatever. You hooked up with some
guy and now you believe in God
again? Girl, you’re just
dickmatized.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 94,

LAMB

No. I know it seems strange to
suffer so much pain for just the
tiniest flash of beauty-- but it’s
fair. I don’t know how, but it adds
up. The world is tipped in favor of
goodness. That’s how I know someone
is there. I can’t see him, or her,
or it, but I know. I can feel His
hand on the scale, making things
even out. Giving our lives worth.

Ryder makes a face that (somewhat) approximates a SMILE.

RYDER
My time is almost up.

Lamb stands up, wincing a little. The usual morning pain. She
walks over to her purse and takes out a MASSIVE ROLL OF
BILLS.

RYDER (CONT'D)
Don’t hand it to me. Just leave it
on the side of the tub.

Ryder looks at Lamb and realizes that she’s peeling off
MULTIPLE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

RYDER (CONT'D)
Hey, I said a hundred.

LAMB
I’m giving you five grand in cash,
and writing you a much bigger check
as well. I know you guys don’t take
checks, but I promise I’m good
for it.

RYDER
Is this a joke?

Lamb is writing a CHECK with a pink ballpoint pen. She
doesn’t even look up as she explains herself.

LAMB
There was a problem with the plane.
Major mechanical failure. Our
families-- my family and Micah’s
family-- they sued and won. I’m
worth like, eight million?

She places the check and the cash on the side of the Jacuzzi
tub, as if it doesn’t matter if it falls in or gets soggy.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

LAMB (CONT'D)
I think people expected me to give
it to my church, but I have some
other ideas. Maybe I’1l be like...
a traveling ministry. People are
always saying “Oh, if I had
millions of dollars, I would help
people.” Well now, I’m that person.

RYDER
Is this a reality show?

LAMB
No.

RYDER
Then why?

LAMB
Sometimes a little ripple can
affect a big change, like...

She quickly amends Melanie’s favorite saying, glancing at the

hot tub.

LAMB (CONT'D)
Like, uh, like that jet in the tub.
Just shooting out a little air.

Ryder looks confused. Then:

RYDER

It’s a good thing you picked me.
Because these other girls-- man!
some of them would just blow it all
on junk or clothes or whatever. Not
me.

(rambling)
I’m going to get some things for my
boys. My one son’s birthday is the
day after Christmas, so.

She gathers up the money.

LAMB
That must have been a great
present.

RYDER

Yeah. Why did you pick me, anyway?

LAMB
I got the flier. I saw your
picture. I liked your face.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 96.

Ryder sees the HUGE FIGURE on the check and gasps in
disbelief. She looks up at Lamb like “Are you serious?”

RYDER
That picture’s 10 years old. I
don’t even look like that anymore.

LAMB
But it’s still you. Don’t say that.
(fierce)
It’s still you.

Lamb suddenly lunges forward and HUGS Ryder, who resists, her
arms and legs locked. Ryder has forgotten how to hug. But she
lets Lamb do it anyway. Passively, charitably, she allows the
hug.

Lamb exhales, shuddering, into Ryder’s sun-damaged bosom. Her
eyes are shut tight.

RYDER
You're giving me one thing to not
screw up.

LAMB

As long as you try. That’s all.

INT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

As Lamb heads down the staircase adjacent to the main stage,
she pauses. She reaches into her purse and tosses a handful
of CASH into the air. It drifts gracefully down onto the
floor. The STRIPPERS FREAK OUT.

BLONDE STRIPPER
Holy crap!

AIRPORT STRIPPER
These are Benjamins!

CHUBBY STRIPPER
Bloody Elbow’s making it rain!

CRAWLING STRIPPER
(pocketing bills)
Thank you, Jesus.

She crosses herself and prays quietly. Lamb watches for a
beat. Then she hurries out the door of the club.
97.

EXT. CHEETAH STRIP CLUB - SAME

The sky is growing light. Lamb walks across the mostly empty
parking lot toward William. One of the bouncers calls out to
her, concerned.

BOUNCER
Hey, where you going?

Lamb turns to face him, stumbling backwards. She opens her
arms to embrace the world.

LAMB
Everywhere.

William takes her gloved hand. They walk off into the dawn.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAWN

It’s a grey early morning. Williams HANDS are COVERING Lamb’s
EYES. He removes them, revealing...

The Excalibur CASTLE that captured Lamb’s imagination when
she first arrived.

LAMB
(pleased)
The castle! Finally.

WILLIAM
Do you like buffets?

Lamb briefly recalls her bad buffet encounter. Then:
LAMB
I love them.
INT. EXCALIBUR ROOFTOP - SUNRISE
Lamb sits on the roof, watching the sun rise among the fake
castle turrets. William appears with two plates. Lamb’s has

MICKEY MOUSE PANCAKES, which she notices with delight.

William settles in and takes in the sunrise. Lamb leans in
suddenly and KISSES HIM.

William is startled, but he does not resist.

LAMB
Thank you.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 98.

WILLIAM
Yes, I’ve done so much for you.

LAMB
I’m sorry about the bar, when I
said you weren’t scary. I lied. I’m
terrified. Here, feel this.

She puts his hand near her heart.

WILLIAM
That’s not fear.

LAMB
You don’t think?

WILLIAM
No.

LAMB

It’s been a couple of years since
my heart raced for any good reason.

WILLIAM
Now it’s your turn.

They KISS again. And we LEAVE them, looking out onto the
waking city...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Lamb returns to her hotel room alone, looking dreamy.
Smiling, she packs her suitcase again, tossing everything in

with uncharacteristic recklessness.

Before she exits, she takes one last look at the now sun-
filled room.

She rises onto her tiptoes and sinks. Up and down. Up and
down again. It’s a strange little bounce. Her arms swing.
Could it be? Lamb is...DANCING.

INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD HOTEL (FRONT DESK) - DAY

Lamb approaches the reservation desk, her bags in tow.

CLERK
Checking out?

LAMB
Yes. 1427.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 99.

She slides over her key. The clerk types on the computer. His
demeanor changes to one of recognition/annoyance.

CLERK
1427. Did you happen to check your
messages upstairs?

LAMB
I didn’t see any messages.

CLERK
When your phone blinks, it means
you have messages.

LAMB
Sorry. I wasn’t in my room a lot.
(winking)
Vegas.
CLERK
Well, you have 17 messages.
LAMB
17?
CLERK

A Doug Mannerheim. Then Melanie
Mannerheim. Then Melanie and Doug
together, crying and singing hymns.
Then Melanie again. Pretty much off
and on like that for hours on end.
Eventually she was just like, “Hi
sweetie, it’s just me, Mel.”

(beat)
She’s crazy.

Lamb is touched. Loray was right.

LAMB
Sorry about that.

She signs for the room, tips the clerk and heads for the
exit. The clerk looks at the tip?

CLERK
Hey, what did you play? Did you
shoot craps?

LAMB
(leaving)
Pardon me!
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 100.

EXT. MANNERHEIM HOUSE - NIGHT
MUSIC UP: A Christmas carol

A CAB from a RURAL TAXI COMPANY drives up the isolated
country road to the Mannherheim’s house. From a distance, we
see Lamb exit the car.

A disheveled Lamb heads up the snow-covered front walk. The
house is lit-up and looks cozy and inviting.

She pauses to look at the big, illumnated NATIVITY SCENE by
the front entrance. Yes, it’s plastic and tacky. But it’s
also touching. Lamb smiles sadly at the Baby Jesus doll
tethered to the manger with a bike lock.

Lamb opens the front door. Melanie is passing through the
kitchen with a cup of cocoa. She wears glasses and sweatpants
and looks adorably frumpy compared to her glamorous “church
look.”

She turns and sees Lamb.

MELANIE
Oh thank God.

Melanie and Lamb rush toward each other. Melanie sweeps Lamb
into her arms, her first words summing up every mother’s
chief anxiety:

MELANIE (CONT’D)
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

Lamb's face is muffled against her mother’s shoulder. They’re
both in tears.

LAMB
No... I’m happy.

Doug hurries down the stairs in pajamas.

DOUG
Is she in pain?

MELANIE
She says she’s happy.

Doug’s relief turns to anxiety in an instant.
DOUG

(worried)
Oh no.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 101.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melanie and Doug sit on the couch near the Christmas tree.
Lamb sits in a chair facing them. Melanie is rapidly tapping
her foot on the floor.

MELANIE
You going to talk first?

LAMB
If you don’t mind...

Melanie’s reply is machine-gun rapid.

MELANIE
Ha, of course I don’t mind. I’ma
very generous listener; you
know me. All-Ears Mel.

She bites her lip impatiently.

LAMB
What I did in church-- it was
wrong. Disrespectful. I had a
problem with people shouting their
beliefs at me, but then I went and
did the same in turn.

DOUG
Everyone understands that you’ve
been through a trial.

LAMB
But they must have been upset.

DOUG
People tried to talk. But your
mother wouldn’t let them get away
with it. She would defend you
through anything.

Lamb looks at Melanie. Melanie looks down.

LAMB
(touched)
Really, Mom?

MELANIE
(quiet)
Yes, duh.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 102.

DOUG
You commited apostasy. Are you
prepared to repent before God and
the community?

LAMB
No.

Doug and Melanie are startled by this.

LAMB (CONT'D)

...not before the community. This
is between me and God. I know you
love your church, but right now I
don’t need the stadium-seating and
the Teen Club and Christian Talent
Night. There’s nothing wrong with
those things, but I want to know
who I am and what I believe away
from all of it. Just me, flesh and
bone.

Melanie and Doug take this in. Then:

MELANIE
Well, you’re a just a little too
old for Teen Club...

LAMB
That’s not my point. I want to go
out in the world and act on it. If
you stay in a place where everyone
thinks and acts the same as you,
it’s just an echo-chamber for
Jesus.

DOUG
(missing the point)
I think the new carpeting really
cut down that echo.

MELANIE
Lamb, you may not realize this, but
I can be bit of a maverick myself.
Remember that sermon about the
dangers of yoga and how it subtly
encourages the worship of false
gods? Well, I thought that was a
bunch of bunk. I went ahead and
joined a yoga class at the gym.
I’ve been going regularly. What do
you think of that?
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 103.

LAMB
Good for you, Mom.

MELANIE
I just change it up a little in my
mind. Sun Salutation becomes God
Salutation. Down Dog is Down Satan,
and so forth.

DOUG
We're not stuffy, honey. We’re open
to hearing about your new beliefs
as long as they’re still extremely
conservative.

LAMB
(carefully)
Dad...I disagree with many of the
things I’ve been taught.

Heavy silence from Melanie and Doug.

DOUG
Certain things aren’t a matter of
agreement or consent. Some things
are just God’s word--

LAMB
(heated)
Or your interpretation thereof--

DOUG
Christ speaks directly into the
hearts of our leaders.

LAMB
Like Pastor Rick?

MELANIE
(interrupting)
Hey!

Lamb and Doug look at Melanie. Her sharp tone implies that
maybe she’s not totally ignorant of the Pastor Rick incident.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
I know there’s one thing God hates
and that’s sharpened tongues in the
home. So let’s just throttle down
here and save the arguing for an
appropriate time, like tomorrow.
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 104.

LAMB
Just-- just let me show you guys
this one thing. You’re not going to
like it, but just promise me you
won't judge.

DOUG
(suspicious)
What is it?

LAMB
This is important to me. Try to be
open-minded.
INT. MANNERHEIM HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MINUTES LATER

The lights are low. The Mannherheims watch Rudolph the Red-
Nosed Reindeer on the big TV. It’s near the end.

Melanie and Doug are tight-lipped with disapproval, as if
they've been forced to watch something racy.

DOUG

Where did you get this?
LAMB

The airport, on my way back.

(then)
It reminded me of a nice time.

MELANIE
Your childhood, huh?

LAMB
Sure.

They watch for a few beats.

MELANIE
This isn’t so bad, I suppose. It’s
clean.

Doug seems surprisingly approving.

DOUG
You know, at least it celebrates
Christmas.
(sanctimonious)
Not Kwanzaa or Ramadan

LAMB
That reminds me. I got this really
cool scarf on my trip.

(MORE )
Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 105.

LAMB (CONT'D)
It would look great on you. I’d
like you to have it.

DOUG
Really? Thanks, honey.

Lamb is completely straight-faced.

LAMB
You should wear it to church.

DOUG
I will.

Lamb snuggles up between her parents. There are certain
things that will divide them forever. But for now, they’re
together and Lamb is safe. Then.

MELANIE
Are you leaving, Lamb?

Lamb stares at the screen. The Misfit Toys, finally
appreciated, are being dropped from Santa’s sleigh into the
outstretched arms of children.

LAMB
This is something I need to do.

INT. IMPERIAL PALACE (BAR) - NIGHT
MUSIC UP: AN UPBEAT PARTY SONG

Close on a POSTCARD from Chicago with a photo of the BLUES
BROTHERS. “Greetings from the Windy City!”

Reveal William behind the bar. He reads the postcard for a
moment. Then, he carefully tapes it to the wall above his
cash register. There are FIVE OTHER CARDS already affixed to
the wall: New York. Hollywood. Austin, Texas. New Orleans.
Walt Disney World.

Loray sidles up to the busy bar in her sequined
“dealer-tainer” finery. William turns around.

LORAY
Another postcard, huh? The girl
gets around.

WILLIAM
She’s on a mission from God.
(then)
I can’t believe they even find
their way here.
(MORE )
106.

WILLIAM (CONT'D)

The address just says “William and
Loray, Imperial Palace, Paradise,
Nevada.”

LORAY
We've worked here so long we’re on
the National Registry of Historic
Suckers.

WILLIAM
At least you're graduating soon.

Though Loray shrugs this off, we see a glimmer of pride in
her eyes.

LORAY
With my lucrative B.A. in
Complaining About Cinema.
(then)
So where is she now? Chicago?

WILLIAM

She was, for a time. The she went
back to Montana to make things
right with her folks. Sounds like
it went fairly well.

(casual)
She mentioned she might want to
give Las Vegas another chance.

LORAY
I see you trying to not smile. Look
at that. You’re like a seventh-
grade girl.

William turns away, refilling a CUSTOMER’S pint glass.

WILLIAM
I’m not smiling.

Loray tries to catch him in the act as he bobs and weaves to
avoid her.

LORAY
Yeah, right! I see you cheesing
back there. Careful, you might pull
a muscle.

The EMCEE has taken the stage. Loray finishes her drink.

LORAY (CONT'D)
I’m up.
107.

WILLIAM
Break one.

EMCEE
Ladies and gentlemen, the Imperial
Palace is proud to present the
musical stylings of our dealing
diva, Loray!

Loray takes the mic.

LORAY
I think you’re going to like this
one. It swings.

She nods to the BAND. We hear the tinkling opening notes of
“Wouldn’t it Be Nice?” by the Beach Boys. Loray begins to
sing in her sweet, clear voice.

LORAY (CONT'D)
Wouldn't it be nice if we were
older...

The CROWD responds favorably, applauding as Loray bounces
around the casino with the mic. This is the musical “happy
medium” she’s been looking for.

William watches her with admiration and affection.

CUT TO:

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Lamb sits in the window seat of an airborne JET. She looks
more confident and assured than we’ve ever seen her.

No longer hiding in shapeless garments, she wears the clothes
a “normal” 22-year-old woman would wear. Skinny jeans, a
hoodie, and a pair of boots. But there’s a small CROSS around
her neck and she still carries herself with Lamb-like
dignity.

Lamb gazes out the window as the sun melts into the clouds.
It’s as beautiful as any religious illustration. But it’s
REAL.

We hear Loray’s voice singing joyfully: Wouldn't it be
nice...

We don’t know where Lamb’s going. But we know she’s going to
be all right.

THE END.
108.
