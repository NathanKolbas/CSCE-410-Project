‘ACT ONE

 
SCENE:

ACT ONE

 

The bar of RICK'S CAFE, Casablanca,
French Morocco, 1941.

About eleven o'clock of a summer's
evening. This is the bar of an ex-
pensive and chic night club which
definitely possesses an impalpable

air of sophistication and intrigue.
There 1s a hectic excitement about

the people and the entertainers that
manifests itself in speech and manner,
At Rear Centre, are double swinging
doors, covered with emerald green tufte
leather, leading to the street. Runnings
from Rear wall to L, side wall is a
semi-circular bar, in green tufted
leather, Walls behind bar are crystal,
shelved for bottles. In front are bar
stools, leather topped, Behind the
bar, along L, wall, is a flight éf
steps. This can be reached only by go!
behind the bar, Along L. wall Centre,
is a door leading to the gambling and
dance rooms, from which, at intervels,
bursts of music and voices can be heard
These increase in volume whonever the
door is opened. At L, front, is a
table at which a man in tuxedo with
white summer Jacket 1s seated, Furthe:
front is another table marked "RESERVE:
Along R. wall, set into it, ere three
tables and a number of seats. At ex-
treme R. corner, 1s a small piano on
wheels, salmon colored, ornate, and eye
filling. There is a NEGRO on a stool
before it. The walls are decorated
with rare tropical birds, flamingoes,
etc. and huge ralm fronds, The place
is full of people, at bar and tables
in evening dress and uniforms. People
entering head for the bar, some seck
admittance to the gaming rooms, but
only efter they have been silently
anproved by the HAN sitting at the
table nearest the L. door, He is
RICK, an American of indeterminate
ace, There is a drink before him,
untouched. The KEGRO, in bricht

blue slacks and snort shirt, open at
the throat, touches the keys of the
1-2

piano softly, playing STARDUST, taking
liberties with 1t. There ts a hum
of voices, chatter, laughter.

The NEGRO, whose sleeves are short,
has one arm completely covercdty
bracelets extending from wrist to
elbow. The door onens, and A MAH in

a beautifully cut, tropical evening
suit with s cummerband, enters, Ee

is about forty, distinguished, with a
comforting aura of solidity end dignity
about him. The NEGRO suddeniy bursts
into wild sing, The MAN looks sround,
nods to several neople. He then comes
directly to the RESERVED table, looks
questioningly at RICK, who nods. He
sits, and irmediately a ‘TAITER brings
@ macnum of champecne in a cooler,

He snezks to the “AITER, who nods

and leys two other places. The NEGRO
is 2leying just loud enouah for the
audience to hear, His playing softens,
and he starts to improvise. The MAN
leans towards Rick.

Ugerte
Join me, Senor?

Rick
No, thanks, Ugarte. You know my rule.

Ugearte
_ (Bowing slightly)
Ah, yes, but I thouzht you might make an exception.
(Ke wits for an enswer, RICK is s4loent)
You sce, I shell be leaving Casablanca, Senor.

Rieck
A pity.

Ugarto
Them you will join me?

Rick

No, thanks,

WAITER and talks to him. The “AITER

comes to Rick's tablo and talks enrnestly

for a morent., RICN listens without

turning his head, holds out his hand.

The WALTER gives him some cards, and

whet might be a nassport. RIC! scrutinizes
this for a minute, shakes bis heed neratively.

Rick
Ugarte...I heard vou sey you were leaving before. I!Aa
rather not huar about it,

(hile this hee been toine on, the WAITER
has returned to the ber, and the refusal
has been relaycd to a stovt, ved-frced
gentleman, very British, in tieeds. Ie
is obviously cn-ry, and strides rcross the
room to Hick, after Hickts teble has beeu
pointed out to him)

Forrester-Smith
Whyeeeswhat..cit's anese

Rick
(Quietly) .
No dice, feller. You're lucky the bar's still open to you.

(FORRESTER-SNITH stares at him, speechless,
walks back to the bar)

Ugarte
Watching you just now, one would think thet you had been
doing this all your life,

Rick
(stiffening)
What makes you think I haven't?
Usgarte
(Vaguely)
When you first eame, I thought...
Rick fr
(Cold1y) .
Yes?
Ugarte

And now I suppose you are going to tell me thet it is bad
business to think in Morocco.

Rick
(Leaning tovard Urarte)
Would you like me to tell you what = did in Rio before
you @iscovercd there was 2 fortune be made selling exit

visas in Casablance,

Ugarta
(Laughing )
Ah, no, Senor Rick. You cannot frighten me...you forget...
IT am leaving.

Rick
You don't let me forget it.
(He rises)
And now if you will prrdon me....

Ugarte
(Putting out a restraining hand)
Not yet. I em in a mood to make confidences, even though
I know how much you dislike confidences, Senor.

{RICK shrugs and seate himself)
Rick

What 1s it with you tonight, Urerte? If you vant sorething
from Fe....come out with it.
/

Vzaw ue
It is very simole, Senor, I want you to listen to me,
For two years now, I have been selling exit vises.

Rick
7 iat not news.
Ugarte
dnd you have been watchine me....and desnisinz me,
Rick
So?
Ugerte

You know something ebout Enurone, Sénor, ‘You hrve ecen these
refugees, They may have everythinrc...money, nvermission to
enter the United States or South America, and yet they can
not leave. Why?

Rick
Do you have to go through all this?

Ugarte
IT insist. They necdcxit visas from the country thet they
wish to lcave, and they ere very difficult to obtain.

Rick
And that's where you come in,

Ugerte
Right, Senor. Just as the lowest animals have their reasons
for existine...so have I. I supply these poor peonle with
the necessary cxit visas.

Rick
For a price, Usarte, for a rice.

Ugarte
(Noddins)
And why not? People pay well to gct out of Eurone tddey,
(He taxes envelope from “nocket, taps it
on his hand)
But until tonicht, no one has hed enoush noney to tet one
of these.

Rick

with luck, I will sell them for more money then even I ever
Greamed of,,,and that, my friend, will be my escanc from
a risky business, and a nasty one. :

Rick .
Now it's a nasty business, You remind me of e@ pimp vho's
hed a windfall, When he quits, he's so sorry for the girls.

Ugarte :
You have your virtues, M'steur Rick, but an undorstanding
heart ts not one of them. However, despite your opinion
of me, you are the only man in Eurove whem I would trust
with these, Will you keep them for mo?

Rick

For how long?
Ugarte

Perhaps an hour, perhaps loncer,
Rick

{Taking them)

I don't want thom here overnight. :

Ugarte .

No fear of that.
(He beckons to the Waiter)
Any messrges for me?

Waiter
No, Mtsieur.

Ugerte
Iam exrectint sove nconle., If enyone asks for me, I will

Iwill make my further confidences to the roulette wheel.

Woman
The Rabbit song.

(There is annlause and enthustastic second-

ing of the tides. The lights dim and the

NEGRO wheels the piano out to the centre of

the floor and starts to play "RUN RaBBIT",

The audience imovs the song and participate,

For example , when he comes to the pert, "Bang,
beng, bang," the audience yells it, while

he hides behind the piano. He darts out and
continucs it, and when he comes to "Run, run, run,”
the audience makes noisc on whatever is handy

to imitate the sound of footstexs. Evoryone
seems to be heving a mrrvslous time, The

NEGRO fe good rnd also scems to enjoy the

song, «t the end they want more, and yell
vocifcrously for cn encore, but the NEGRO

wheels the piano beck, smilingly and sterts

to play. They kcep anpaluding and he holds F
up his hend for stlence. They quiet down

and the lithts come on)

heads urhositatinmly for Rick's table )

Rinaldo .
Good evening, Ricky.

Rick
Hello, Rinaldo.

(LUIS RIN:LDO pulls out a chetr ot Rick's
teble with the assured air of - man who
knows he 1s welcome and sits down)

Rinaldo
Ricky, I am in love.

Rick
Still or agnin?

Rinaldo

Again, ond I hopo it will be ogoin and ogrin and egoin,
icky, she is.,
(Ho ropes for words, gesturing)
beautiful,
Naturally.

(There is a short silence. RINALCO makes
& gesture of despair)

Rinaléo
Ricky, Ricky, I will never understand you. You are inhuman,
incredible, you do note..or...you do not exist!

Rick
(Taking from his cost pocket an unusual,
large wooden key on an attractive loop,
ang twirling it idly)
All right, Luis. What's her name?

Rinaldo
Sut of courss, I ao not know.

Rick
Of course.

Rinaldo

I saw her for the first time this afternoon. She was like
a painting, a symphony, a poem. That is why I am here.

Rick
You made an appointment.

kKineldo
But of course note She is not the type of woman you canes.
(fie whistles)
like that. This is « cumcaign, Ricky. She is almost virginal
in her beauty, but she will be hers, and from now on the
Prefect of Police will haunt your bar.

Rick
What makes you so sure she will come?

Rinuldo
She 1s a strenger...a refugee...on her wey to, america with |
her husband, a bird of passag....and everybody comes to
Rick's.

Rick
You know, Luis, I...+e

Rinaldo
Say 1t, my friend, say it.

Rick

Why do you have to pick these kids? There are plenty of good
looking sophisticated women around here who know what it's
all about, youcese

Rinaldo
Pour le sport, Ricky, pour le sport. There is something
that attracts me about these unawakensc girls, something thut
challengeseesand after Ait, What 15 vg orm,

Rick
Remember liuti....the little girl who jumped out of the window?
Rinaldo ‘
She was a fool.
Rick
Maybe, but f still....
Rinaldo

They are buying something..-they must pay for it...and what
a pleasant way of paying!

Rick
Forget it. You're incorrigible.

Waiter
(Who has approached tho table)
Pardon, M'sieu, but the people at tuble five would like you t¢
join them.

Rick
(Without looking up) ?
Tell them.,.. :

Walter
(Apologetically)
I aaid thet you never drink with the guests. But they spend
SO much mMoneyeeee
(He spreads his hend in o gesture of
untola wealth)
and the lady...she said that you fascinate ner.

Rinaldo
(Deliberately twisting sround to stare)
Ah, a lady.
Rick
Tell them, I'm sorry. .

(The WAITER bows, leaves, goes over toa
party sitting at a table on the opposite
side to make explanations)

Rineldo
If my ledy of the afternoon comas, you will chango your mind.

Rick
Don't forget I've seen other of your ‘ladies of the afternoon!

Rinaldo and Rick
(Speaking together)
But this one ig differ.ee.
(THEY laugh)
Rinaldo
But I did not come here tonight just to discuss women.

Rick
What could be more interesting to you?

Rinaldo

: (Very seriously)
Victor Laszlo.
Rick

In Casablanca?

Rinaldo
He ise And that's what I want to talk to you about.

Rick
Why me?

Rinaldo
That will give you some idea of his importance...when I speak
to you ebout him. Rick, there are a lot of exit visas sold
in s cafe. That is fine. ‘Ys know about them, and we
know that you have never sold them. That is one of the rea-
sons we permit you to remain open.

Rick
That's very decent of you.

¥

Rinaldo
Do not joke. Laszlo is prepared to offer a fortune to any-
one who can furnish him with a visa, and in case you mignt
pe bempted, Ricky...i wanted to tell you that he must stay
ere

Rick
Of course this fortune offers no temptation for you.
Rinaldo
None whatever.
Rick .
It will be interesting to see how he manages.
Rinaldo
Manages what?
Rick
His escape, -
Rinaldo
(Expostulating)
But I just told you...
Rick

(Calmly interrupting)
I'm not a chila, Luis. This is no sudden interest that has
C

Rick (Cont)
been taken in Laszlo. In order to get here, he must have
taken the refugee trail. I know that he was in Paris, and
from Paris to warseilles, from Marseilles to Oran, from Oran
to Casablanca is a long, long, way...and they must have been
after him every step of it.

Rinaldo
We do not care about the way he came. ‘ie are going to ses
that he stays. :

Rick
Eow about a wager?
Rinaldo
If it's reasonable.
: Rick

Five thousand francs he reachss Lisbon.

Rinaldo
Lone. No matter how clever. he is...he still needs an exit
visa, or I should say, two.

Rick £
Why, two? . .
Rinaldo
He is travelling with a lady.
Rick
He'll take one.
Rinaldo
I think not. I have seen the ladys
Rick

No one can keep him here,

Rinaldo :
You have not seen this woman, And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles, nor in Oran, he will not leave her in Casa«
blanca.

Rick
Perhaps he is not as romantic as you.

Rinalco
It does not matter...one or two..s.romanticist or note.scethere
is no exit visa for him.

Rick

You're certainly determined about that, Luis.
Rinaldo

I have had my orders,
Rick

I see. Gestapo spank, eh?
1-12

Rinaldo
(Sitting back and selecting a cigarette
from a magnificently jeweled case)
Sometimes you talk like your countrymen reporters Rick. You
over-estimate the influence of the Gestapo. We Qe hot interes
fere with them, and they do not interfere with ts.me

Rick
Sorry. It is easy to understand why the Gestapo is inter=
ested in Laszlo, but I don't see where the French police come
in.
Rinaldo

It is not necessary for you to see, Rick. Would you be sure
prised to know that the French police are interested aven in
you? Yes, my friend, you and our pigeon.

(He takes a ttle black book from his

pocket, opens it, ana riffles through

the pages
Ah, here you are. Richard Blaine, American. Age (here I
shall be discreet) formerly @ prominent ana successful
attorney in Paris. Married to the daughter of Alexander
Kirby. Two children. Left Paris in 1957 because...

(At this point RICK stiffens, and makes an

almost threatening gesture. RINALLO looks

at him slyly} co,
We will pass over that. Your wife obtained her divorce in
Reno, in 1939 and has custody of the children.

(He pauses)
Shall I go on?

#

Rick
Lon't bother.

Rinaldo
of course, Ricky, where my friends ere concerned, this is
only a matter of routine.

Rick
(Lifting his glass)
To our continued friendships
-(They drink)

Rinaldo
(Putting down his glass, speculatively)
Now if it were the lady...I might...

Rick

You'd "make your heaven in a lady's lap."
Rinalao

You have yet to sea here
Rick

I don't have to.
(Za mimicks Rinaldo's words and gestures
earlier in the scene)

She is...er..,beautiful.
1-15

Rinaldo
(Sharply)
I teil you that this woman is one a man might well lose his
soul for.
(While THEY were drinking their toast to
friendship, a striking looking blonde enters.
She is the worse for drink, but manages to
walk fairly steadily to Rick's table in
time to overhear the last words. She reaches
for the key in Rick's hand. He withdraws it.
She slips into a seat}

Yvonne
Rick has no soul.

: Rinaldo
(Smoothly)
Just what I was saying, Madame.

Yvonne
But hets nice to sleep with.

Rinaldo
I would not know, Madame. — ;

Yvonne
You want to know something? I love Rick, Rick doesn't love
Mee

Rinaldo

Love is like that. I will have a arink st tho bar.
Rick

Don't go, Luis,
Yvonne

You see? He's afraid to be alone with me.

Rinaldo
Iam sure you are mistaken. Rick 19 & man of- great courage.
Tae gets up and walks to the bar)

Rick
I'd offer you a drink, but you seem to have had enough.
Yvonne
You're angry ‘cause I'm a little high.
Rick
Angry? Not at all.
¥vonne
Then kiss me.
Rick

I'll do better than that.

Yvonne
Oh, Ricky!
Rick
(Reaches out and takes her elton)
Itm going to take you rigit out to your car.

Yvonne
(Pulling her arm away)
Oh, no, you don't. You did that the last time, so I sent it
back tonight.

Rick
That's fine. Wow you can have your choice. Hither I seud
you back in my car, or you walk.

Yvonne
(With drunken stubbornness)
No. I'm going to stay hares

Rick
(Gestures to a WAITER, who approaches)
A special,
Yvonne
You going to buy me a drink?
Rick f
Yes. . :
Yvonne

That's nice. You know I hed to bs drunk to come hero, and
now I'm going to stay drunk. Good old Kicky.

(THE WAITER returns with a reddish urinic.
YVONNE raises tho glass to her lips,
abruptly puts it down)

This is no arink!

Rick
It's what you need.

Yvonne
Why are you such a louse, Ricky?

Rick
If you want me to talk to you...drink it.

Yvonne
If I do, then you'll let mo stay?

: Rick

For a little while.

Yvonne

(Drinks, grimaces)
See? I'ma good sirl.

Rick
Sure you ere.

Yvonne

do go, until, at the end of this scene
she is completely sober)
But not good enough for yous

Rick

Yvonne
Then how am I going to see you?
Rick
You're note

stay in her own back yara. Instecd, I have to go and fall

Rick
Now look, Yvonne. Befors we start that. You're over twenty=

tended this was anything more than it was. .

Y¥vonne
What was it?-

Rick :
Two people who were bored...and lonely...and attracted.

Y¥vonne
I get it. And now you're bored again.

(There is a short silence as RICK makes no
reply to her last line}

QeKe Thanks for the drink.

{She gets up and exits through the swinging
doors. RICK watches her go with a wry smile

on his face, tihile the last few lines of
dialogue were being spoken an OFFICER in an
Italian uniform, and a French OFFICER have been
in a heatea argument with gestures. After
Yvonne leaves, the OFFICERS move away from

French Officer (Cont)
the bar, but before he can reach thom,
RICK, who was out of his sest instanteously
and smoothly, grasps the FRENCHLAN by the -
arm in a jiujitsu grip and propels him
rapialy to the door)
Attendez un moment. Je vous explique..s

Rick
On your way, soldier.

(4 WAITER and RINALLO are helping the
ITALIAN OFFICER to his feet. RICK comes
back and atands before them. To the Italian)

You, too. Outside.

(THE OFFICER exits slowly, and there is a
low, criticsl grumbling from the patrons.

The uniformed men mave, dangerously restless.
RINALLO tukes a small, silver whistle from
his pocket. RICK holds up his hand, standing
erect in the centre of the room)

Ladies and gentlemen.

{The place quiets, listening) : .
This is a place of entertsinment. ‘hon you come here you
leave your political opinions behind. That's where they
belong, anyway.

(There is a ripple of laughter)
While you're hera £11 do everything I can to make your stay
pleasant but...thorea is no var.

(Cheers end shouts of approval)
You come to forget it. Forget it!

(The tension hes broken. RICK turns to his

table. RINALLO catches sight of a man, not

in uniform, and in street clothes, entering)

Rinaldo
(Calling)
Misieu Martinez.

(RICK has almost reuched his table)

Martinez

Ah, Captain. Good evening. I am glad rou ere here.

Yassuh. Thank yuhe
{He exits past the piano and out of the room
into gaming room)

Martinez
He is very loyal.

Rick :
He's been with me a long while -- Have another drink.

Martinez
Thank you.
(He drinks)
If you should ever change your mind about solling...

Rick
You'll be the first to knowe

(The door opens. A YOUNG KAN in German

uniform enters. He is saluted smartly by

other Germans in the room. He is freshe

facea, with a clear healthy complexion, :
bright olue eyes, and the typical cropped :
head of the Prussian. He walks easily and
directly to the table)

officer
(With no trace of accent)
Good evening, Captain.

Rinalao
(Rising)
Captain Strasser. ‘jon't you sit down?

(STRASSE2 looks pointealy at Rick and

Martinez)
I forgot you hacn't met. Rick, this is Ceptain Heinrich
Strasser, new attache to the German Consulate. Captain
Strasser, this is Hick, the most celebratea cafe owner in
Casablanca, and Senor wartinez, who is also the proprietor
of a famous cafe.

Rick
Will you join us?
Strasser
(Seating himself)
Thank yous
Martinez

I also have a business to attend to. Captain Strasser, you
must honor the blue Parrot with a visit some night.
(He rises, preparing to leave)

Rick
Stay awhile. It's early.
Nartinez
Not tonight, thank youe Some other time. Goodnight,
gentlenen,
{He bows and oxits past the ber)

Rick
(To Strasser)
Cen I order something for you?

Strasser
(Pieking up list) :
You will permit meses
(To the Waiter)
Ghowpagne...and a tin of caviar...very cold,

, Rick
(fo the Weiter)
Bring sone of nines

Strasscr
(to Rick)
That is theughtful of you.
Rick :
Not at all, .

Strasser
We are unaccustomed to such consideration from un jnerican.

Rinaldo

(Quickly)
Rick is wmlike any .merican you have ever met, Captain. He

is completely neutral.

Strasser
So I have hoard. I understand you came here from Peris in
37. :

Rick
(With ao slightly sour smile)
That seems to be no scercte

Strasser
(With a lightning glance at Rinalzo)
I have alwuys been happy in Peris. I htc hoped to be sta-
tioned there,

Rick
A pity.

Stresser
4h. So you arc not ono of those people who cannot irxmino
the Germuns in their boloved Puris.

Rick
Ohno, I can imagine anyone anywheres
Strasser

How about London?
Rick

Yes. But first you have to get there, Captain.
Strasser

Most people did not think we were going to get to Parise
Rick

Only stupid pcoplo.
Strasser

Had I scid that I should have been accused of intolerance.
It wes not that they were stupid. They simply failed to
realize the might of the German military uachine.

Rick
Only partially, Captain. The French were careloss, and
lazy, and they reaped their reward.

Rinaldo f
That 4s a little part of Ricky's philosophy, Captain. ~
Everyone gets what he deserves, och, Rick? -

Rick
Gonerelly. Life usually balences the books.

Strasser
You are very clever. Who do you think will win the war?

Rick
I haven't the slightest léca.

inalco
Nor the slightest intercst, Captain.

Strasser
Thet is almost suspicious.

Rick
Isn't it?

Rinaldo

Now, Ricky.
(Then to Strasser)
Ceptein Strasser, I assure you, Rick iseee.

Rick
Rick 1s a cafe owner. His political opinions do not inter-
fere with the operation of this cafe, ‘When they do,
Captain Strasscr, I shall be very glad to answer any
questions you may ask,

Rinaléco
There is no one like Rick, You will find that to be so
after you spend some tine in Casablancas
Strasser

I do not know how long I shall be here, I have come on
a mission.

Rinaldo
We shall have time to amuse ourselves.

Strasser

No doubt, .
(Turning to Rick)
I understand Guillermo Ugarte frequents your cafe, -

Rick
He comes here ofton.

Strassor
Of course, you know what his business ia,

Rick
I have no idea...nor an I particularly interested,

Rick
I think so.
Strassor

Rick

Rick
I see,

Rinaldo
We are waiting for Laszlo now. We expect that Ugarte
arranged to meet hir: hore,

Rick
So Laszlo gets cold decked, You're a fine fellow to bet
with. :

Strasser
He ts an cnorny of the Reich,

Rick
There aro othors,

Strasser
You do not soor. to understand, Victor Laszlo never caused
publishing the foulest lies in his Prague newapapors until
the very dey we marched ine And even after, he continues
to print scandal shoots in a cellur,

Rineldo
One must udnit that he has great courages i

Strasser
Yes. He is clever, too. He nenaged to escape fror:

(At this point the door from the goming room
opens and UGARTE emerges, He looks crounc,
sees Rick, Rinaldo and Strasser, and starts
rapidly for the door, STRASCER leaps up)

up the stairs)

Too bads

It appears he's an old friend of mine.
Rinaldo
Wonderful! Now we can all be friends,
Victor

He must be'an interesting man, ‘he ctmosphore of a night

but before he can speak, S7RASSER and

RINALDO approach)

Rinaldo
May I introduce 4 friend of mine. Captcin Strasser,
Madame Meredith, M. Laszlo,»

Strasser
(Clicking heels, bowing)
How do you do.

(RINALDO and STRASSER wait to seat themselves)

Victor
Iam sure you will excuse me if I an not eracious...but
you see, Captain Strasser...I am a Czech.

Lois
San, Rick didn't forget to include a dressing room in this
luxurious establishment, did he?

Rabbit :
A dressing roores.as..0h, sure, Right down that way.
(He points to Rear R. She heads thero,
He prepares to move the picno, VICTOR
hends him a b4111) :

Buy yourself u drink,

Rabbit

Thanks, «ah could use ona,

with a largo silk handkerchief)

. Strasser
Ian glad of this opportunity --

Victor
You evidently did not hear me. I repeate I una Czech,
This is my table and I find your presence offensive.

Strasser
My hearing 1s excellent. I have sonething to suey, and I
intend to say it. It would bo regrettable indeed, if you
were to couse a disturbance and be taken to jail.

Victor
What is it?

Strasser
Thet is more like it, May I?
(Incicuting chair, VICTOR shrugs
incifferenti;)
We shall not mince words, ‘’o have hunted you for the pust

1-30

Strasser (Cont)
we have run you to earth, You heave re:.ched Casablancaces
and you will sier in Cuseblancal

Victor
That is problematical.

Strasser :
Not at all. Gcptain Rinaldo is not only Prefeot of Folice,
but also head of emigretion...the man whose signature is
necessary on every exit visa,

Victor
Icom perfectly aware of the Ceptein's official duties.

Strasser
Then you will understané, Captuin Rinulde, do you think
it possible thet M. Luszlo will recelve o vise?

Rinaldo
Iam afraid not. I regret, Htsieur, You seGesess
Victor #
Save your apologies.
Strasser
So you see.
Victor
Perhaps I shall like it in Caseblonca,,
Rinaldo
And Madame?
Victor
You need not be concerned about her,
Rinaldo

No? «ah, pardon. Perhaps rou are right. She may finc it
pleasent here with her old friends,

Victor
(Ruging, but forcing a smile)
Your solicitude is quite touching, Captain.

(There cre now nore ncople leaving, the
room is taking on thi.t leta apncerance
which presuges the closing of & night club)

Strasser
Laszlo, we ore not unreasoneblc. You can stuy here indef-
initely...or you can leave in the morning for Lisbon.
On one condition,

Victor
And thet is?
1-31
Strasser
(Leaning forward, speaking intently)
When you left Prague, you had on deposit in various other
countries a sun anounting to seven miliion dollars. You
made this money by vilifying the German governnent'and its
people. Germany is entitled to it!

Victor
I see.

Strasser .
After all, you have your permit to enter the United States.
For a mon of your background and ability, it should be an
easy matter for you to start all over again. In such a re-
ceptive country, you can amass another fortune by following
the same tactics you used in Prague and Paris.

Victor
You anticipate my intentions perfectly. But Gemiany gets
nothing.

Strasser
You are quite certain of yourself.

Victor z
I have come this far successfully and I do not believe that
you or anybody else can stop me now, .

Strasser .
You will find things vastly different. ‘le have not really
tried...until now.

Victor
Now that we have had our little chat, I would appreciate
having my table to myself again.

Strasser
There is one other thing. Your stay in Morocco may not be |
as pleasant as you expect.

Victor .
You will not dare to interfere with me here, This is still
Unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality will re-
flect on Captain Rinaldo. And I am certain that it will be
his unpleasant duty to see that there is none.

Rinaldo
Monsieur, you have my assurance that...

Victor
Thank you.

(STRASSER rises, clicks, bows, departs.
LOIS returns, RINALDO hesitates)

Rinaldo
Monsieur, believe sie, Ieee

Lois
The party breaking up?

Victor
Captain Strasser had to leave, and now Captain Rinaldo
is following hin.

Rinaldo
Your,..er...iMf. Laszlo is angry with me, Madame.

Lois
If I were you, I should be frightened. Victor's anger is
not to be taken lightly.

Victor
He prefers it to Captain Strasser's.
Lois
Oh. I see.
Rinaldo
Not quite, Madame.
Lois :
: (Catching the PABBIT'S eye, and beckoning) :
Play "AS TIME GOES BY", Sam, -
Rabbit

(Coming over with the piano)
I can't remember it, iliss Lois.

Lois
I'll hum it for you,
(She starts to hum)

Rinaldo
But surely you know it, Rabbit.
(He starts to hum, too)

Rabbit
I can't seem to get it.

Lois
Somehow I didn't think you would.
(She rises and comes close to piano)
Let me play it for you.

Rabbit
No, Miss Lois, I think I got it now.
(He begins to play it very softly)

Lois
Sing it, Sam.

Rabbit
Ah dunno the words.
bow

Lois
(Softly) .
I'll give them to you.
{She starts) :
"You must remember this,
A kiss is just a kiss
A sigh is still a sigh..."

Rinaldo
(To the Rabbit)
Start from the beginning, and I will sing, too.

(The RABBIT starts acain)

Rabbit
I remember now.
(He starts to sing in the curiously husky
voice of the Negro. As he gets to the third
line, RICK appears at the head of the stairs}

Rick
Sam! What the....
(He checks as he sees Lois. He descends

and crosses to the table. SAM stops) :
Lois
Hello, Rick.
Rick
Hello, Lois.
Lois

This is Victor Laszlo. Victor, an old friend of mine,
Richard Blaine.

: Victor

Won't you join us?
Rick

Thank you.

(He seata himself opposite Lois)

Rinaldo

Mademe, you have just made history.
Lois

It isntt the first time. You must read my memoirs.

Victor
I didn't think that a cafe such as this existed in Morocco.
It 1s a delightful surprise. .

Rick ,
Life is full of surprises in Casablanca.
(He looks at the RABBIT, who wheels piano
away, and exits)
: Lois
Let's see, the last time we met....
Rick
Was at La Belle Aurore.
Lois
How nice. You remembered!
Rick

Any man would have remembered. Do you still wear that

shade of blue?

Lois
You see, Victor? I told you blue was ny color,

, Rinaldo
Ricky, you are coming alive tonight. I am sure that we
have you to thank for that, Madane.

(RICK withdraws the key which he had been

toying with earlier in the scene. His hand

is towards the audience and unseen by the

others at the table. His hand stvals beneath i
the table to meet Lois'. She takes the key

without comment)

Victor
(To a Waiter) .
A drink for If. Rick.

Rick
No, thanks, I never drink until...oh...about three.

Rinaldo

(Glencing at wrist watch)
That rominds me. ‘ie have a curfew here in Casablanca.
It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found

drinking after hours.

Victor

(Beckoning to Waiter)
I'm afraid we have overstuyed our welcome.

Rick

Not at all.
(He takes the check from the "laiter)

Victor
Oh, please, I couldn't...

Rick
Not tonight.

Rinaldo
Another precedent broken, This has been a most interesting
evening.

 
Victor
Thank you. We shall be back...often.

Rick
I hope so.
(By this time they have all risen and are on
their way to the door. The place has emptied.
Almost at the door, LOIS turns wearily)

Lois .
I've had a wonderful evening...really wonderful....and I'm
so tired. Victor.

Rinaldo
After you have been in Morocco a while you will not be
tired...the climate is so wonderful.
(the doors close on Lois! reply)

(RICK stands for a while in deep thought.
Then he goes back to the table, sits down
where Lois was scated, and buries his
head in his arms)

(THE RABBIT enters softly) :
Rabbit
(Standing hesitantly for some tims)
Boss.
{No answer)
Boss!
Rick
(Head still burisd)
Yes?
Rabbit
Boss, let's get out of here.
‘ Rick

(Lifting his head, facing Sam)
I'm waiting for a lady.

Rabbit

(Terrified)
Boss, no, Listen to me, boss. I've been with you for a

long time now. Boss, c'mon hone.

Rick
No.
Rabbit
Please, Boss. There's nothint but trouble for you there.
Rick
Go on home. Don't worry ubout me.
Rabbit

Boss, we'll take the car and drive all nisht. Wetll gct

Rick
Shut up and go hone.

Rabbit

{(Stubbornly)
No, suh. I'm stayin!’ right here.

Rick
(Getting up and roaming restlessly around)
What the Hell's the matter with Tony? These lights should

have been out ten minutes ago.
Rabbit

Ah'll go sea about it. But you should a been gone a long
time ago. You shouldn't a been here tonight atall.

Rick
Maybe.
Rabbit
( Joyfully) :
Now you're talkin'! Ahtll go tend to de lights, and.den
wetll go.
(He exits rapidly) :

(RICK walks behind the bar, pours himself
a drink, swallows it quickly, shivors,
The lights go out suddenly, the stage

is almost dark savo for a few subdued
lights along the side walls. RICK lights
a cigarette and the tip glows red as he
pulls on it)

(The RABBIT returns. He has a Jacket on
now over his shirt)

(Coaxingly)
C'mon, Boss.

Rick

(Stepping out from behind the bar)

All right. All right. Don't rush me.
{He stands hesitant for a moment. The
RABBIT takes his arm, gently urging
RICK towards the door. Suddenly RICK
shakes himself free)

Sam! Get over to that piano!

Rabbit
Whut !

Rick
You heard me.

which he had left there, takes a glass, goes
to a table, sits there waiting)

Q.K., Boss.

Rick
Did you hear me?

ACT TiO

Scene 1
Place: Rick's Cafe,
Time: About ten o'clock the next morning,

The room that wis so exciting the
previous night is drab and meretri-
elous in the day. The chairs are
on top of tables. No sun can fet
in, and there is just the susges-
tion of sunlight across the dusty
floor. In fact, it is necessary
to have a few of the sidelights on
in order to see.

WHEN THE CURTAIN RISES: TiiO REN
are finishing sweeping and cleanin:
the floor, When one of them comes
to the piano, he pushes it brusque-
ly out of his way, It slides;a
little way across the floor ahd
the notes tinkle. -

First Cleaner
Take care, Albert.

Albert

(Following the pieno and standing looxing

down at it, broom in hand)
If I had listened to my parents, I would not now be sweeping
up the filthy floor of a cafe. Mo. I would be an artiste.
I would bow to the applause...

(He does so)
of beautiful men and women in beautiful evening clothes.

(He sits down at the piano, makes a

gesture of shooting his cuffs, mibs

his hands, and in general goes through

the motions of a concert olarist preparing

to play)

First Cleaner
Did you really take lessons?

Albert

Did I? Listen.
(He runs the scales rather clumsily)

First Cleaner
Well, play something.

Albert
Remember I have not touched one of these for many years.

First Cleaner
Go ahead,

(ALBERT starts to play a simple exercise
very badly..,but with feelings)

Rick
(Descending the stairs behind the bar. He
is dressed in slacks, sport shirt, espadrilles
on his feet, and a jacket and scarf complete
his costume)
Pardon me, Paderewski, but I'd like my breakfast...vite!

, First Cleaner
(Starts busily to finish and leave, ALBERT
leaps up from the stool, dusts it hurriedly,
and exits)
Oul, M'sieur, I get Arthur for you right away.
(They exit. RICK goes over to one of the
tables, takes the chairs off it, as ARTHUR,
one of the waiters of the night before, 7
enters)

Arthur
Pardon, M'sieur Rick, but you are here earlier than usual.

Rick
This is an occasion, Breakfast for two this morning,
Arthur.
(RICK lights a ciparette)
You'd better bring two large glasses of orange juice, plen-
ty of buttered toast, very thin, and not too much butter.
If we want snything else, you can get it later.

. Arthur
Very good, Mtsieur.
(He walks away)
Rick
And Arthur....
Arthur
Yes, M'sieur?
Rick

This morning we will have the good coffee.

(ARTHUR nods and exits. RICK walks around
nervously, stops at the piano, toys with

the keys, suddenly realizes that he 4s pick-
ing out with one finger "AS TINE GOES BY".
He stops and goes back to the swinging doors,
looking out, and breathing deepiy In the
fresh air)

descends. She is dressed as we saw her last.
She wears the white gowm, and carries the

cape on her arm. RICK springs over to open

the bar for her to pass through)

Lois
How romantic, Ricky. Thani you.

Rick
Don't mention it. Breakfast?

Lois
Splendid. Where shall we have it? At the bar?

Rick
No. I cut-that out when I left Paris.

(Meanwhile the WAITER enters, sets the
table deftly, leaving two huge glasses
of orange juice)

Lois
(Seating horself at the table) :
So you remember La Belle Aurore?

Rick
A man can hardly forget the place where his guts were
kicked out. ,

Lois
You know, had you bothered ta ask me, I could have explained.
Rick
(Sardonically)
I was pressed for tine.
Lois

So Richard Blaine, of Paris, criminal lawyer, champion of
lost causes, becomes i. Rick, dispenser of entertainuent
for Casablanca.

Rick
There isn't much difference. You meet qiite a lot of nasty
people in both professions, But tell me, what happened to
Henri?

Lois
(Shrugs)
What does happen to men? What happened to you?

Rick
(Slowly)
You wouldn't want me to tell you, would you?

Lois
Be nice, Ricky, please,
2-1-4

Rick
I should have remembered. You don't like hearing unpleasant
things in the norning.

Lois
So many things to remember and you remember that.

(ARTHUR enters with plates of toast under
a serviette)

Rick
(Smiling grimly}
You're good, Lois, But a man does a lot of thinking in four
years.

. Lois
I think I liked you better as a lawyer.
Rick
No doubt.
(He takes his orange juice)
Shall we?
Lois z

It's rather daring but....
(They drink)

Rick
You always looked beautiful.... even with those circles
“under your eyes.

Lois

Thank you.
. Rick
(Fiercely)

Tell me, what the hell made you come to Casablanca?

Lois
Victor.

Rick
Accommodating of you.

Lois
Isn't it?

Rick

Did you have much trouble getting through?

Lois
Some. But Victor has friends, Once we got out of Marseilles,

the trip was almost pleasant,

\ Rick
How is Paris?
Lois
Are you safe to talk to? Ons never knows these days.

Rick
How is Paris?

Lois
Stinking.

Rick

That's what I thought. Toast?

Lois
Thank you,
(She takes soma, ARTHUR enters with
coffes, and serves them)

Rick
How come this fellow, Leszlo?
Lois
Darling, this coffee is delicious, Itts a miracle.
Rick
How come Laszlo? i
Lois °

Ricky, Victor is the most wonderful man I've ever met,
Really, believe ms, there is no one like hin,

Rick
(With a significant slance upstairs)
Yes, you made that quite clear,

Lois.
(Opening her handbag and siving Kick the
key thet she took the previous night)
You're a fool, Ricky. You may need this again,

(RICK pockets the key)

Rick
I hope,

Lois
I don't taink you'd understand a man ldice Victor, Hels...
well... Oh, I know this sounds like Warwick Deeping... but
he's a man with a real purpose in life,

Rick
And seven million bucks.

Lois
Yes, I suppose I wouldn't have been... oh, letts talk about
some thing else,

Rick
Good, What do you like? Cricket, baseball, ths war?
2-1-6

Lois
(Wearily and disgustedly)
Oh, the war,

Rick
Disgusting, isn't it?

Lois
I've told you once that you were much nicer in Paris, and
I meant it. Youtve chan.... ,

Rick
I was more naive, you mean,

Lois
Yes, And gentler, and rougher, and smarter, There was some-
thing fine in you, Rick.

Rick
You fixed that, darling. Remember? You took everything
that I over believed in, swept it up into a neat little
pile, and put a match to it. Now it's gone. Burnt out,
that's me, io cause to believe in. Nothing to fight for.
Lois
I did all that?

Rick
That and a lot more. As someone I know would say, I am ina
mood to make confidences. I'm going to tell you why you
got that key.

Lois
May I have some more coffoe?

Rick
Certainly.
(Pouring from the pot - He sits back)
Let's go back a little,

Lois
If we must.

Rick
I first met you in Paris....

Lois
In the Gare St, Lazare....

Rick

In the Spring. And I went overboard, Lois. I don't think
you know what it is to be so much in love.

Lois
You're forgetting, Rich.
2-1-7

Rick
That's right. You were, for a year, to be exact. And then,
on the evening of April twelfth, 19356, you walked into
La Belle Aurore, With that perfuned thing that called itself
a man.

Lois
Where you were dining with your wife....

Rick
You knew about it. That's move than I did,

Lois
Henri, at least, was handsome.

Rick
Sure, Henri was handsome, Henri was enarmins, but oh, God,
Henri was dub,

Lois
Itm afraid so.
Rick
Never mind, You know I told YOUsee you knew...
: Lois i
Oh, Ricky, lot's not go back over all... -
Rick

You're right, At any rate, you and that duamy did a beautiful
wrecking job that night. And afterwards, when I picked up
the pisees and luft Paris...

 

Lois
Without leaving a forwurding address.

Rick
The smartest thing I ever did. If I had, I'd still be ror-
giving you, und taking you back, watching it heppen ogain,
and forsiving you aain.

Lois
We're not in court, darling...

Rick

Oh yes, we ore, This has boen a long time coming to trial,
but hers we go. I spent a ysar pulling down the stars und
the moon for you. All right, I loved it, And thon you
walked out of my life and thore were no gtars snd no moon...
and damn little sun. I spent four years deasming and hoping
that some day ['u have you asain -- just ones -- no matter
how... end I have... and I'm finished, ‘

Lois
Oh, I sec. Male so.

Rick
Call it that if you like, and woat was it with you?
2-1-8

Rick (Cont.)
(He leaves the bar and walks over to the
table, standing directly above her)
I wonder. Was it perhaps that there is another little star
that you wanted me to pull down for you? If it is, Lois,
let ms tell you that you've had everything you're going to
get from me,

Lois
Poor Ricky.
(He stands bewildered at this answer)
It never entered your head that that was all I wanted.

Rick
Don! (Spinning around and walking away)

Lois
What else couid I want of you?
Rick
An exit visa.
Lois ?

(Amusedly ) i
Would it make your male ego feel any better if I asked for

one? If so, I will.

Rick
You were going to, anyway.

Lois
May I remind you that I'm travelling with Victor Laszlo?

Rick
So what! Seven million dollars and still not onough for an
exit visa,

Lois
You've told me your little dream. Now listen to mine, A
fairy tole with a nasty ending. Once upon a time I met a
man in Paris - and there were fireworks, When I looked up
at the sky I didn't feel small and all alone -- instead I
faowgnt I could reach up and touch the stars with my hands.

(RICK starts to say something)

Lois
No, This is my fairy tale. He left and sometimes I used to
dream of what would happen if I evsr mt him again, And
thon I did... in 2 cafo in Morocco... and for a littlo while
I was back in Paris, But I was fooling myself, Rick. When
the dawn cams: I was in Morocco, in a tawdry cafe with a man
who was empty of everything except bitterness,

Lois
Would it help if I say I'm truly sorry?

Rick :
Your being here is what helps. You know I didn't call you
although I stayed in Paris for a month after,

Lois
I know,

Rick
I had a crazy idea that I might run into you... by accident,
you know, sort of casual like od I'd@ say "Hello, there,
light of my life," sort of gay....

Lois
And nonchalant, darling, Inconsiderate of m not to have net
you somewhers. I stiould have realized a man has his pride,

Rick
When I was driving, «nd I'd soe a woman in the car shead, I
had to puss it... bucause you see... it might have been you.

Poor Ricky,

Yes, and even when I cam hore... I was still looking, I
didn't know it... but I was... and thon last night. God!

Lois
My heart did flip flops, Rick, whon you como down those

I'd have killed you.

Now listen. You're not going back there. I went through

This is too important to us,

Lois
(Almost maternally)
Ricky.

Rick
You're going to stay hera, Right within arms' reach, Not

Victor could have been in America oy now... uf 2t weren't

Remember ?

(She holds up a warning finger. He subsides)
I got sick at the wrong tire. Victor had every oyportunit:
to get away safely in those last hectic days before the
armistice. But he stayed. By the time 1 was well snough
to go, things were so bad that I would never have gotten
this far without him. Don't you think that the decont thi:
to do would be to go back there and tall him?

Rick
What are you going to tell him?

There isn't much to say, is there?

No.

I don't know now, but whatover it is.... it's got to bo

the idea comes to her)
Well, anyway, he'll have an easier time getting an exit visa

Rick
(Slowly shaking his head)
Not a chance.

(Coming swiftly back)
Why, Rick, what do you mean? i

Rick
Casablanca is the end of the trail for him.

Are you sure?
Rick
Dead certain.
Lois
Ricky, I can't say goodbye to him, knowing that.
Rick
So that's how 1t is. .

(Coming to him)
How happy do you think we'd be leaving him hero to rot
without lifting a finger to help him? Rick, you've got to
get him out. We can afford to be gonorous.

Rick
You don't know what you're asking.
Lois
I think I do.
Rick .

You don't know Casablanca as I do. Ho's the biggest thing
ever to hit this town. Nobody would darc.....
 

2-1-16,

Lois

Having m back hasn't made much difference, then?
Rick

What do you mean?
Lois

Still burnt out. Still not a champion of lost causos.

Rick .
On, Lois. I don't want trouble. I've just found you again.
Laszio is just anothor refugee... richer and botter known
than mosteces Noses :

Lois
You're wrong, Ricky. He's ono of the few mon willing to
lift up his voice and tell ths world to fight for what he
believes in. And he can fight, Rick. With what ho knows,
and the way he can say it... it's mich moro important for
him to get an exit visa than for you or mo.

Rick
(Turns and walks away. Ho druma ona tablo.
LOIS watchos him anxiously. He pacos round z
the room, stops at the piano, and toys with -
it, finally picking out "As Tim Goos By")
Another star for you, Lois.

Oh, Ricky!

Better lot the Captain have his way, Lois. He's talkative
in the morning. '

Good evening, Rabbit.

Evenin', Captain Rinaldo.

2-2-1838
ACT TWO
Scene 2
The bar of Rick's Cafe.

That evening. Once again wo see
Rick's as it was in Act.1,Scone l.

The room is brilliantly lit. Thore
is laughter and chatter, out it
is earlier in the evening than in
the first act, and the place is
not so crowded.

The RABSIT is sitting at tho pianc
attired as he wag in the first
act, playing and singing softly.
Rick's table ts unoccupied, but
there is a reserved sign on the
other left front tablo as usual.
The RABSIT is obviously nervous
and distrait. He continually
@lancos at the door, and then
mops his head with a hanéckorchief.
Shortly after tho CURTAIN RISES,
the door opens and RICK, haggard
and worn, ontors. He is drassed
as wo last saw him, and his cos-
tumo is incongruous in this
athoring., The RABBIT immodiatel;
oaves the piano and goos to Rick.
RICK pats him on the shoulder,
and takes a drink at the bar.

Tha RASBIT evidently wants to tal:
but RICK shoves him toward ho
piano, ard climbs tho stairy bo-.
hind the bar. Tho RABsIT shakes
his hond worriedly, and returns
to the piano. Shortly aftor
RINALDO, also attircd as ho was 1:
Act One, Scone Ono, entors. lie

‘glances around, openly searching

for Rick, but upon failing to finc
him, goos to tho piano and the
RABBIT stops playing.

Rinaldo

Rabbit
2-2-19.

Rinaldo
Where is Rick?

Rabbit
(Shakes his head)
Jos' went upstairs = Captain.

Rinaldo
Anything wrong?
Rabbit
Ah don't know, Captain. Ah'm jes' worried.
Rinaldo
About Rick?
‘ Rabbit

About somepin' dat ain't none of mh business.

Rinaldo
(Laughing)
I'm sorry. I did not mean to pry, but I thought that per-
haps I could help. :
Rabbit .
(Empha tically)

Nossuh!

Rinaldo
(Lightly)
You man that it 1s somothing that the Profoect of Police
should not know about.

Rabbit
Mister Rick never did nothin! wrong.

Rinaldo
So it its Rick?
(The RABBIT doos not answer. He concentrates
on the keys of the piano)

You know, Rabbit, you ara a good friend of M'siour Rick's..
and so am I, If he wero in trouble, we would both want to
holp him. That is why I am going to confide in you.

(Tho RABBIT stops playing)
We know what a gamblor Rick is. Ho has made a very foolish
bet with m, and ho is just onough of a sportsman to take
a big risk to win 1t... and as you mow, ho will not pormit
me to call it off.

Rabbit
Ah can't make him stop gamblin', Captain.

Rina ldo
Of course not. But we can prevont the samo thing happoning
to him that haproned to Ugarte.
2-2-20

Rabbit
wWhut do yuh mean?

Rinaldo :
Ugarte 1s dead, Rabbit. And he died becauso ho had the
papers which M'sieur Rick hns now. And that ts your job...
to get them away from him and give thom to mo. when you
do. reett forget all about 1¢, and M'siour Rick will
e safe,

Rabbit
(Slowly)
Ab dunno....

Rinaldo

(Smoothly)
Of course, once I have the papors, I shall call the bet off.

Rabbit
Ah'm all mixed up. Ah dunno whut you're talkin! about.
Whut ah was worried about was wimmen trouble.

Rina ldo
You moan Mme, Meridith.

Rabbit
And how!

Rinaldo
If it wore not for her, I do not think that Hick would be
in any trouble about these papers.

Rabbit
Dat woman jest breathes trouble.

Rinaldo
Yos. That affair in Paris was oxceodingly unfortunate.

. Rabbit
Unfortunate! Dat's puttin’ it mildly. Ah nursod Mistor
Rick tru de D.T's, do heebio-jeebios, and a lot of othor
things ah never saw before. Pini elephants! Doy wag -
jos' as common as flios in July!

Rimildo
I think we should take care to ses that he stays out of
troublo this time.

Rabbit
Yassuh!

(RICK, dressed as he was in the First Act,
appears at the head of the stairs)
2-2-21

Rinaldo
(Qutenty | but smoothly)
Fine. Then we are allios, eh?
(RINALDO turns away without waiting for
an answor, to greet RICK, who has reached
the bar and is coming slowly towards them)

(RICK throughout the following is in a
tense, bitter mood. he is impatient,
jorking out his answers, controlling himself”
with an obvious effort)

Helio, Ricky.

Rick

Hello, Luis.
(Be walks to tha table, and he and RINALDO
seat themselves. ARTHUR hurries to tho

table)
Brandy.
Arthur
A pony?
: Rick
A bottle. -
(To Rinaldo)
Brandy for you, Luis?
Rinaldo
Thank you, no. I profer.es+
Rick
(Half to Arthur, half to Rinaldo)
Champa gno.
(ARTHUR hastens to tho bar)
Rinaldo
I tried to reach you bofore, but you wore out.
Rick
Yes?
: Rinaldo
Ugarto 1s dead.
Rick
(Disinterested)
A pity.
Rinaldo

But beforo he dlod...w
(Ho pauses for a long time, RICK is silent,
RIWALDO pormits himself a little laugh
half in admiration of Rick's coolness)

he left a very peculiar message for you,
2-2-22.

Rick
Yes?

Rinaldo .
I will try to recall his exact words... lot me se6e.. he
said, "Tell Rick that evon a pimp can die like a mn.”

R
And did he? tox

Rinaldo
(Half regretfully)
We had no chance to find out. You see, ho managed to kill
himself before we could ask him some questions that we md
in mind.

Rick
Too bad.

Rinaldo
Yes. By the way, does that message moan anything to you?

Rick
Not a thing. He must have been delirious.

Rinaldo -
Perhaps. -
(A silence)
I will be frank, Ricky.

Ricky
No reason why you shouldn't be.

Rinaldo
When Ugarte camo here last night he had something that wo
want very badly. That 1s why he was arrostod. Whon we
searched him, he did not havo it.

Rick
Are you sure he had it when he was horo?

Rinaldo
Certain. And tho only conclusion to be drawn is that he
left tt here. .

Rick
It might holp if you told mo what 'it' is.

Rinaldo

Ugarto had two lettors of transit that would permit anyone
to leave Casablanca. Naturally, wo want them.

Rick
With a follow like Laszlo around, I can understand that.

Rinaldo
He may have left thom horce
2-22-25

Rick
I don't think so, but if it will make you any happier, you
can search. ‘

: Rina ldo
(Urdanoely)

There is no talk of scarching. It is simplythat I could
understand how anyone might be tempted to hold on to some-
thing as valuable as these, if they fell into his hands.
And it 1s dangerous. In fact, Ricky, if those lettors of
transit should ever bo used, you would find yourself in an
uncomfortable position.

Rick
Thanks.

Rinaldo
Not at all. You say you know nothing about them... that is
all there is to it. It is finished. Let us talk of

somothing else.
(Apologetically)
About my tactlossness of this morning. o. :

Rick
Forget this morning. Whore the Hell is Arthur?

Rinaldo
Ricky! I have nevor seen you like this.

(ARTHUR approaches with two bottlos, RICK
savagely snatches tho brandy from him, pours
@ generous drink, He downs this swiftly)

(Tho RABSIT plays a thundorous chord or two,
almost ominous in quality. RICK smiles grimly)

: Rick
Hear that?

Rinaldo
(Looking towards piano)
Qns could not help but hear it.

Rick
(Nedding towards the Rabbit)

Rinaldo
(Gently - laying a hand cn his arm)
Rick, forgive mee

Rick
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be all right.

Rinaldo
What I wanted to tell you before was thet it was net
entirely her doing. That might help, yes?

Rick
What?
Rinaldo
Oh, yes. Did you not knew? Laszlo sent her:
, . Rick
(Half rising)
Why, thate.crs
Rinaldo

(Forcing him back)
Laszlo ig s very clever man. He has found out, either
frem her or elsewhere, about the Paris affair. Eg
thought it was a sur6é methcd of obtaining the letter.
. Rick :
(Sterting to laugh)
Oh, Christ.

Rinaldo
(Slightly alarmed, but watching him very
closely)
You are amused?
Rick

It?s sc damn funny.»

Rinaldo
Yes, it ise Laszlo wtll probably bo hera tonights
Rick
Fer what?
Rinaldo

For the lotters, cf course. He decs not knew that you

Perhaps... Perhaps note

Rinaldo
(Spreading his hands in a typically —
Latin gesture)
But I spok: with them yesterday afternoon. You
remember? I told you I had met them.

Rick
Yes. But how can you be sure?

Rinaldo

You know me. I am not very discreet. We talked cf
Casablanca, and of course, one cannot talk of Casablanca
without talking of you. I am afraid, Ricky, that I
boasted of my frisndship with yous And I am sure now
that I gave them the impression that you cculd do some=
thing, for them.

(He sighs)
Unfortuns tc.

Rick
(Grimiy)
Yes. : .

Rinaldo "
And new I understand Laszlo's cenfidence of last night
when he spoke cf leaving. He hed this in mind.

We come from Bulgaria. Things are very bad there, M'sieur.
A devil has the people by the throat. So Jan I, we ... we
did not want our children to grow up In such a country.

Rick
(Wearily)
So you decided to go to America.
Annina

Yee. But we do not have much money, and travel is so difficult
and expensive, M'sieur. It took much more than we thought
to get here. On the way, we met a very kind friend who told
us that exit visas could be obtained here through a man named
Ugarte.

(RICK gulps) '
When we arrived, we looked for him.

: Rick
Where did you look?

Annina
Everywhere. We inquire at the hotels, at the bars. Then
Captain Rinaldo sees us and he is so kind. Ee wants to help.

Rick -
I'll bet.

Annina
He tells me that he can get an exit visa for us. But --
(Again she hesitates)

Rick
For a price?

Annina

(Gratefully)

Yes. But we have no money.

Rick
Does Rinaldo know?

Annina
Oh, yes.

Rick
And he 1s still willing to give you an exit visa?

Annina

Yes, M'sieur.

Rick
What is it you want to know?

Annine
Will he keep his word, M'sieur?

Rick
(St111 looking at his drink)
Eo always has.

(There is a silence)

Annina .
M'sieur, you are a man. If someone loved you... very much,
so that your happiness was the only thing in the world that
she wantcd and .... she did a bad thing to make certain of
it, could you forgive her?

Rick
No one has ever loved me that much.

Annina
But, M'siour, if he never knew ... if the girl kept this bed
thing locked in her heart ... that would be all right, wouldn't
it? , .

Rick z
(Harshly)
You went my advice? .
Annina
Oh, yes, M'sieur, please.
Rick
Go back to Bulgsric.
Annina

The bed things thcre would be for a lifetime. This is for
just a few hours. .

Rick
You seem to heve made up your mind,

Annine
M'sieur, I would not hositato for a moment if it were not
for what Jan might think. I kmow what it means to Jan to
be able to leave Surope. I am only ofraid thet he would
not like to be helped .... that way.

Rick
You'd do anything for him, wouldn't you?

I never knew there were places like this.

Rick
(To Jan)
There's an old saying, "What people don't know doesn't hurt
them.

Rinaldo
(Sitting down and gesturing to JAN
to do likewise)
Precisely. One of my favorite maxims.
(He looks at Annina's glass and sees that
it has never been filled}
But this is bad. You do not drink?

Jan
I do not like her to.

Nonsense. In champagne are the bubbles of life and love.

Here, my dear. . F

Come, drink it.

Annina
I think I'll have just a little gin.

tilts 1t gently, so that a good deal more
than she intended to drink gocs down her
throat. She chokes a little and JAN is
visibly upset)

Rinaldo
(Laughs ) a
You mst learn to drink champecgne, little one ... and other
things.
Rick
She could get along without it.

Jan
(Shooting him e grateful glance)
I think so, too.

Rinaldo
You are too young to know much about a number of things,
my friend.

Jen .
I am old enough to know what I want my wife to do.

Very good. Very good. But you also must consider what
other men would like your wife to do.

Annina
Oh, Jan. Do not be alarmed. I will not get drunk. Later
I will show you thet I can walk a straight line.

suddenly rises)

Rick
I'll be back in a little while. I'll see how the tables

are doing.

Jan
Anniaa, I think we should go.

Why, it is ecrly. You cannot loave now.

Annina
Please, Jan, I am having such a good time.

If we stay, you must promise not to drink any more. f

You may stay with mc end drink all you want.

You fool! If you went an exit vise, do not interfere.

tance, but the swing goes through, the blow
lands, and RINALDO crashes over backwards
in his chair to the floor. At the seme moment,
RICK reaches up and switches off the light from
a wall switch behind him. There are screams and
curses. After a short intorvsl, the lights go on.
RINALDO is standing in the middle of the floor,
holding a hend to his face. He is livid with:
rage. Other people are standing. RICK is in
the identical place that we have last scen him.
There is a cigarette in his hand, which he
lights calmly

(fo the Gendarme )
Stand outside. Watch everyone who leaves. There is only
one exit. :

Rick
Now look, Luis ....

Rinaldo
You look, my friend. This was very suspicious. Lights go
out and pecple disappear. Perhaps they managed to reach the

This will make it easier for you.

stairs behind the bar)

their bill, and are preparing to leave)
I would like you to stay if you can.

Victor

Of course.

disappointed. He looks at Lois and Victor.

restless. Then the RABBIT says, without
turning)

No.

Although the tables are ali set,
there are no customers present.
Rick's is still closed. The lights
are not as bright as when the place
was open for business, but the stage
is well-lit.

WEEN THE CURTAIN RISES: RICK is
alone on the stage, seated at his
usual table working leisurely over
gome books and papers. From time to
time he glances at the door, as if
expecting someone.

After a short time, the door opens
and the RABBIT enters.

Rick

Did you get them, Sam?
Raboit

Yassuh. :

Rick
Not for the first time, Luis. Remember? You closed us up
last night.

Rinaldo
Until we have settled this, I am Captain Rinaldo.

Rick
Fine. Then it ‘won't be necessary for me to offer you a
drink. With the place closed, froe drinks are quite an

You forgct Itm an American citizen.

Rinaldo . .
It 1a the one thing that keeps you ont of jail. And even
that will not save you when we have proof.

Rick
Of what?

Rinaldo
Let us review the events of the past few days. First, a
notorious seller of exit visas is arrested in here. When we
scarch him, he does not heave the letters of transit that
we know were in his possession when he entered your cafe.
You disclaim all knowledge of them. The next evening, the
Prefect of Police, a very good fricnd of yours, is assaulted
before half the people of Casablanca by » young fool. The
lights go out, and the people responsible for this outrage
disappear. Once again, you know nothing about it.

Rick
I'm awfully sorry, but I can't protect you from joalous
husbands.

im

Rinaldo
(Sharply)
But you can protect the husbands.
Rick
That's ridiculous.
Rineldo

It is the truth. Thos. children heve never been in Casablanca.
It would have been imposeihle for thum to cvade us for this
length of timc without help. You ere the onl; person they
know here.

Rick
Not mich proof, there.

Rinaldo
Not onough to arrest you, but sufficicnt for us to seo that
you do not leave.

Rick
Is thet what you came to tell mo?

: Rineldo .
Not entirely.
(A peuse)
I can nover completely forzut whet has heapponed, but if
you turn the Vicrccks over to me, you will he permitted to

open.

Rick
Theat makes it touch «.. beenusc, you sec, I can't give you
whet I haven't got.
Rinaldo
(Shaking his head)
You are stubtorn.
(He rises, and prepares to leave)
Rowever> when you change your mind, you may call me at the
station. .

Rick
If I locate them, I'1l let you know.

Rinaldo
(Exiting)
It will be much better for you if you try hard.

(The RABBIT re-enters )

Rabbit
He sure is'’mad, boss.

Rick
Sam, do you think you were followed when you bought those
tickets?

Rabbit
Ah dunno, boss, but he sure got here awful fast. i

Rick -
That can't be helped now, but we'd better lock the door.

(The RABBIT walks over and locks 1t)

{JAN and ANNINA come in from the gambling ,
room and approach Rick)

Rabbit
If yuh ain't got nothin! fer me to do, boss, ah'd like to
catch up on my sleep.

Rick
Go ahead, but I'll need you later.

(The RABBIT exits behind the bar and up
the stairs)
Jan
Mtsieu, we overheard. we cannot allow you to take this
trouble for us.

Rick
(Rising, going behind the bar and starting
to mix a cocktail) '
Quiet. Speak to the brains of the family. Ste understands.

Jans,
I understand, too. Your cafe is closed, You are in dif-
ficulties with the police...and all because of my stupidity.
Annina
You were not stupid, Jan.

(RICK pours out drinks for them without a
word, hands them to them)

Rick
You kids hungry?

Annina
No, Kisieu. We could not eat a thing.

Jan
Misieu Rick, this has becoxs too dangerous for you. We
shall have to leave some time, and I think it is best that
we go now,

Rick
That's a good idea. Where were you planning to go?
Jan
I...er...I...have no plan. It is dark, and...er...
Rick i

And if you get from here to the comer without being
arrested, I'll give you the place.

Jan
Even so, N'sileu, we should go.

Rick
It's going to be wonderful for Annina when youtre in jail,

Jan
But you will take care of her?

Rick
I won't'be in a position to take care of anyone. Figure it’
out. If you walk out of that door, you're finished....
and it won't do me any good, either. The only thing that
could help me is if I turned you in to Rinaldo myself,

Jan
Then we will arrange it that way.

Rick
What kind of a heel do you think I am?

Jan
But, M'sieu, we cannot stay here indefinitely, and if you
will not let us leave, what is to be done?

Rick

Finish your drinks and give me time to think of a way out.
(He comes out from behind the bar and
begins to pace up and down nervously,
Rick (Cont)
biting his thumb, They watch hope-
fully. Suddenly, he stovs, as an idea
comes to him. He snaps ris fingers.
Then he shakes his head negatively)

No. He won't fall for that. .
(He resumes his pacing. After a short
time, he says slowly)

Yes, that should do it.
(He turns to Annina)

You trust me, don't you?

Annina
Yes, Ktsieur,

Rick
C.K., then, Sit tight.
(lis walks to the bar, reaches behind
it, and brings up a telephone)
Heilo. The police station, please.
(Pause)
Thank you.
(Pause )
Hello. Captain Rinaldo, please.
(Pause )
Hello, Luis? .
(Pause) :
This is Rick. Yes, yes, you win. I'm beginning to see it
tre right way now,
(Pause }
Even I can maize a mistake.
. (Pause and laughter)
Well, come on over here, and I'll have something that will
interest you. |

Jan
So you have changed your mind.

Rick
Not atese.

(There is a knock on tre door)

Jan

Annina

Lois

Don't you know I always do the wrong thing?
Ric!

Lois

Lois

Rick

Lois

Rick
Don't worry. I invited him.

Lois

Rick
Playtime is over, Lois...at least for me. I'm going to
work, and if I miss...
(He takes a deep breath)
Well, Ilct's not think of tmt.

Lois
Can I help?
 

Rick
Now that vou're here, you'll have to. Wow, listen! ‘ie
must matce Rinalde believe trat we're terribly in love...

Lois
That's easy.

Rick
And that we don't give a damn about Laszlo.

Lois .
Oh, Ricky. That doesn't sound good to me. I.....6-

(A knock at the door interrupts her)

Rick
(Xing to open door)
Everything ‘will be fine 1f you just follow my leads 1
amd...oh, hell, you don't necd what I was going to say.

  

Lois
Tell mo,
Riek

(He opens the door nm RINALDC enters)

Rinaldo
Ricky, I imew...
(He catches sight of Lois snd bows)
Madame, this is a pleasant surprise.
(To Rick)
You did not tell me therc was a reason for changing your
mind.

Rick
You don't kave to know evorything.

Lois
I hope not.
(She crosses to Rick and puts an arm
through Fis)
Shall we heve a drink, darlinc?

Rinaldo

(Slyly)
Now that you are soon to re-open, you ean afford it, ch?

Rick
Of course. And champrgno, too.
{To Rinaldo)
Luis, you do the honors, ‘ie want to hold hands.

(RINALDO goes behind the bor and brings
up a tottle of champu.no, while RICK snd
LOIS do hold hands)

Lois
Don't ever let me go, Ricky.
3-9

Rick
You're sure you'll never regret what you're doing?

Lois
(Tilting her head back and looking
straight into nis eyes)
I'm sure,

(RINALDO has filled glasses, and THEY
pick them up)

Rick
TOceee

Rinaldo
(Picking up his glass)
But Ricky, to love!

(THEY drink)

Rinaldo
And now, Rick, the Vierecks.
. Rick
Let's sit dowm a moment, Luis.
Rinaldo
I like it here. Where are the Vierecks?
Rick
How much of a man are you, Luis?
Rinaldo
The Vierecks?
Rick
Trey're here. Right in the other room.
Rinaldo
(Starting out from bebind the bar)
Good,
Rick

(Walking to the end of the bar, and
holding him)
Now, Luis. Wait.

Rinaldo
een I arrest them, you may open immediately.

Rick
You're forgetting something else you wanted.

Rina ldo
One tt. ing ata time Is encugh for me
pushes RICK geatly aside and starts
fox the door)

 
5-10

Rick
Tre letters of transit, Luis.

(RINALDO che cks)

You may heave those, too,
(RINALDO swings around)

Rineldo .
Ab, you make me believe that you are really tre old Rick,
again.

Rick
(Drawing LOIS close to him)
I've straigh tered out what was bothering me.

Lois
You mean I caused oll this?
Rick
Darling, for ma, you're a sort of personal earthquake,
Rinaldo
Have you the letters? i
(RICK nods) -
Where?
Rick
You must m.ke some concessions, Luis.
Rinaldo
I have already given you permission to open,
Rick
I want more then thet.
Rinaldo
Money? ¢
Rick
No, The Vicrecks.
Rinaldo .

(Looking at Lots )
I do not understand, ‘What can they mean to you?

Rick
Never mind. But if you could Fand Laszlo to Strasser on
a silver platter, what would tmt mean to you?

(LOIS draws a sharp breath, and RICK
presses her close to him)

Rinaldo
(Walks over to a table, sits, ami takes out
a cigarette from his case with the some de-
liberation that ke ased in the First Act)
Sometimes you frighten ms, Rick. I amafraid tmt you are
vee

Rinaldo (Cont)
too subtle for my Gallic mind.

Rick
There's nothing subtle about tris. I have no resson to like
Isszlo, except sertaps that he broutht Lois back to me.
(He turns and looks at her. She presses
closely against him)

Rinaldo
No, Rick, Ido not trust you. There is something wrong.

Rick
Suppose I were to telephone Laszlo, from here, with you
listening to every word I say, and ask him to come and
pick up that letter of transit.

Rinaldo
That sounds very interesting.

Rick :
And you could wait here with Lois and me until he came and
then catch him receiving 2 letter of transit t which he
bas no right-- z

Rinaldo -
Marvelous!

Rick
Good enough to let the Vierecls use the other letter of
transit to leave Casablanca?

Rinaldo
(Sitting back)
So,

Rick
There it is, Luis. Take it or leave it.

Rinaldo
Wrat is there to prevent me from walking into that room,
and arresting them nov?

Rick .
You're too smrt todo that. They don't mean. thing to
you...and Victor Laszlo neans 2 great deal.

Rinaldo
It is not . bad bargain, but why 211 this interest in the
Vierecks?

Rick
(Turning to include Lois)
It's our Inst cesture townrds sentimentality.... kind of
peace offcring to love,

Rinaldo
And how do you feel avout this Madam? You were travelint
with Laszlo.
5-12

Lois
That is my offerin- to love.

Rick
Well?

Rinaldo

I would like to hear you use the telephone.

Rick
(Wolring over to Lois and holding her
by the shoulders)
Lois, whem you cane bere the other night, you cam for an
exit visa, didn't you?

: Lois
Yes, Ricky,
Rick
And even if I'd been a drunken, dissolute bum, you still
would have slept with me.

Lois

vem

Yes, Rickr,
(He tilts her chin up and gives her 2 fleet- -
ing kiss on the lips, and turns to the phone }

Rick
(Walks to telephone on bar, picks it up,
RIWALDO wetching him closely)
Hotel Splendide, Plenso,

Rinaldo
(To Lois, while RICK wits for the
connection)
If I should ever travel, and, in a. moment of weakness, ask
you to accompany me, please refuse,

Lois
You wontt ask me. I'ma little too old for you.

Rick
(Gotting the hotel)
Mr. Laszlo.

(After LOIS! lest remark, RINALDO has
teken a elsarette fron bis case, and is
tappins it slowly on nis case. Then,
with mock sorrow

Rinaldo
As you say in America, another nail in my coffin.
Lois
You should smoke more, and drink less, Captain.

Rinaldo
(Looking at her yuestioningly)
Just how do you mean that, Mademe?

Lois
Just exactly the opposite of the way you think I mean it,
Captain.

Rick
Hello, Mtsieu Laszlo. This is Rick.
(Pause)
Fine, thank you. And you?
(Peruse)
That's toeo.bad. fut I think I have some good news for vou.
(Pause)

No, I'm still closed, out I have hopes. Listen, I've
thought that matter over, and I'm willing to give you those
papers thnt were left here for you.

(Pause)

Don't worry about that. She's kere now, waiting for you.
(RINALDO glances quizzically at Lois, z
who bites her lip} :

Lois
May I have a cigarette, Captain.
Rinaldo
Certainly,
(He offers her one, and lights it for ter)
Rick
Yes, bring a bag, the Lisbon plene lenves in half an hour,

(Pause)
Right. And don't forget to tne plenty of money.
(RINALDO grins sardonically)
No, not for that. I've something else in mind.
(Pause)
Save it.
(Pause )
Forget it. I'll see you shortly.
(He rangs up and tates 2 drink from the bar)

  

Rinaldo
Eravo, Ricky! Well done.

(With 2 sigh)
I hope so.

A votre sante,

Lois
Not champagne, darling. Brandy,

Rinaldo
(Also raising a glass)
Shall we drink to love again?

Lois
(Quietly)
Noe Let's drink to France.
: Rinaldo
With all my heart,
Lois

(Turning to Rick)
To France, and to Parigess ag we knew it,

(They drink) z

Rick -
(Calling)
Annina, Jan. Come in here, -

(ANNINA and JAN enter slowly from
the gaming room)

Rinaldo
(Urbanely)
Good evening,

(ANUINA and JAN acknowledge this in
small voices)

Come, come, this 1s no way for old friends to act.

Rick
Captain Rinaldo has kindly consented to overlook what
happened last night and permit you to leave,

Rinaldo
Yes, yes, Thanks to the good words Mtsieu said for you,

Jan
(To Rinaldo, stiffly)
Thank you, M'sieu, but we have no exit visas.

(LOIS goes to Annina and draws aside
with her, murmuring) .

Rick
Oh, yes you have.
(He walks to the niano, lifts the top
and extracts the envelope that Uzarte
had given him in the First Act. He
takes one letter from the envelope and
hands it to JAN. With a glad ery,
ANNINA breaks away from Lois and’ runs
to read over Jan's shoulder)

Rinaldo
4ht I should have guessed!
Annina
(Disappotntedly)
But these are not exit visas, M'sieu.
Rinaldo

Noe They.are better, Madame. You will have no difficulty
leaving with those,

Annina

You are so kind. I do not know how to thankess
Rinaldo

M'sieu Rick deserves all your thanks. ?
Annina , - .

(To Rick)
Misieu, there is very little we can do, but I shall say
a@ prayer for you. .

Rick
(Slowly)
Say it for a man named Ugarte... I think he's got it
coming to him. .

Lois
Anning.
Annina
Yes?
Lois
I think I'd like you to say a prayor for me, tooe
Annina
Oh, Madame, I willl
Rick

(Reaching into his pocket, and
crossing to Jan)
Here are the tickets for the planes

Jan
(Taking them)
We shall remomber you all our lives, H'sieu.
(To Annina)
Come, Annina,
3~16

(JAN starts for the door, and ANNINA
goes to Rick and kisses him sweetly)

Annina
I wish you every happiness, ii'sieur. -
(Then, very shyly, sho goes
to Rinaldo)
And you, too, M'sieu.

Rinaldo
What? No kiss for me?
Lois
Ah, nice, A friend of the family.
Rinaldo

(Looking at her)

Yes, Madame,
(He takes ANNINA by the shoulders
and kisses her on the forehead)

(JAN and ANNINA start for the door)

Rick
(To them)
Waits
(To Rinaldo)
Haven't you forgotten something, Luis?

Rinaldo

I do not think so. Why?
Ricle

How about calling off your little watchdogs outside?
Rinaldo

oh, they will not give them any troubles
Rick

Now, Luis, behave lt
Rinaldo

If you wish, I shall...
Rick

I wish.

(RINALDO crossos to the front door, opens
it, takes the little silver whistle from
his pocket, blows it. A GENDARME cones
almost immediately) :

‘Rinaldo
Withdraw the men. Tho place is no longer closed, nor
under surveillance,

Gendarme
But, Captoinese
Rinaldo
Those are my orders.

Gendarme
(Saluting)
Yes, Captain.

(RICK saunters over to the door, and,
as RINALDO starts to close it, he
holds 1t open)

Rick .
You don't mind, Luis?

Rinaldo
(Grinning)
Not at all, my friend.

(RICK peers out for a short time, then
he seems satisfied and closes the door)

Rick
(To Annina and Jan)
The plane leaves soon. Go directly to the airport. You
know how to get there? ?

Jan
Oh yes, M'sfeu,.

(They start for the door. At the door,
ANNINA turns, wants to say something, thon
exita quickly, closing the door behind her)

Rinaldo
(With a sigh)
I wonder if it was wise.

Lois
Den't worry, Captain. I am sure that there are still
women left in Casablanca.

. Rinaldo
(Looking at hor spoculati vely)
Yess. Oh, yes.

Rick
(Going to the bar)
How about a drink?
Lois
Another, dear?
Rick

I thought you wanted to ‘get drunk.

Lois
Not quite yet. Ina little while,
3-18

Rick
Come here, darling.
(She moves slowly over to him, and he
suddenly crushes her in his arms, and
attempts to kiss her. She struggles)

Lois
Rick! Rick, we have company.

Rinaldo
It 18 of no consequence...as you said, a friend of the family,
(They kiss)

(There is a knock on the door, as
they stand locked in each other's
arms, They separate)

(RINALDO, moving swiftly)
I shall be in the other room,
(He exits into the gaming room)

(RICK starts for the door}

Lois
(Grasping his arm and pulling him around)
Oh, Rick.
(He looks down into her eyes, for a long moment)
Rick

So many things to remember.
(He breaks away from her and opens the
door, VICTOR enters}

Where are your bags?

Victor
In the cer,
(Then, to Lois)
<I brought yours too, dear.

Rick
Here 1s your letter of transit. You haven't much tims, The

plane leaves soon.
(As VICTOR takes the letter)
You won't have any trouble at Lisbon, will you?

Victor
No. That is all arranged.

Rick
Goods
(RINALDO comes slowly out of the
gaming room and walks quietly
across the floor)

Rinaldo
Mtsieu Lazzlo, you are under arrest. The letter, please.
3-19

(VICTOR spins around in consternation,
LOIS' hand goes to her mouth)

Rick
(Who has taken a gun from his pocket
and levelled it at Rinaldo)
Not so fast, Luis, not so fast. .

Rinaldo
(Staring Open-mouthed for a moment)
Have you lost your mind, Rick?

Rick
No. You've lost the game. Sit down, over there,

: Rinaldo
(Walking towards him)
Put that gun down.

Rick
(Not retreating a step) -
Luis, it would make very little difference to me if I'had to
shoot you. And I will, if you take one more step!
(RINALDO halts for a moment, and studies :
Rick, Then he shrugs)

Rinaldo
Very well,

. Rick
Sit down 3

(RINALDO walks to a table, at right, and
sits, and takes out the cigarette case)

Rinaldo
I suppose you know what you are doing, but I wonder if you -
realize what this means?

Rick
Perfectly. We will have plenty of time to discuss that
later. :
(Then, to Victor and Lois)
You'd better set going if you want to make that plane.

Lois
(Starts to run towards him)
Ricky | io.
(LASZLO catches her by the arm.
She strugcles)
Let me gol Let me got

Rick
Thanks, Victor,
Lois
(Raginz) :
Oh, yous. .youss.

. Rick
No, darling, he was right. If you had run in front.of ra,
my good friend the Captain piget have turned the tables.
(She ceases to struggle

Lois
All right. I'm sorry, I shan't be so stupid again, But,
Victor, you must let me stay here, I'm not going with you,

Victor
That, my dear, is entirely up to you.
Rick
(Sharply)
You're going, Lois,
Lois

No, no, no! You fool, I'm in leve with you again. It's
true that I came here for an exit visa, when I saw you,
my Imecs went weak, I'mesee

“Rick z
You're going, Lois, There's nothing here for you, You “told
me....i'm finished...all burned out..Victor's still fighting,
and he needs you, Lois. .

Lois
(Frantically}
I don't care. I'm...
Rick
Get her out of hore, Victor, for God's sake...
Victor

(Pulling her towards door)
Rick, are you sure it's worth it?

Rick
-(Foreefully)
I'm sure...You've got a job to do.

Vietor
(Swoeping LOIS with him towards door)
Thank you, Rick, and no matter what you think...you're
still fighting.

: Rick
Oh, Victor, .
(VICTOR pauses and looks questioningly
at him)
Those kids that were in here, the other night. They're
goin to be on tre plane with yous Take care of them, will
you

Victor
Of course. And isn't there anything eee

Rick
Forget it, Youtve cot to make that plano.
5-21

(VICTOR and LOIS reach door. VICTOR
goes through first: LOIS stands in
doorway for a moment, silhouetted in
the light.)

Lois
Goodbye, Rick.
(She exits. RICK goes over to his table,
Left, still watching RINALDO closely, ard
keeping the gun trained on him. RiCK sits.
There is a silence) :

Rinaldo
How long do you intend to keep me here?

. Rick
That depends,
(He raises his voice and shouts)
Sam! Sam!

Rabbit
{From upstairs)
Comin', boss.. :
(The RAEBIT comes down stairs, As he is :
coming towards them) :

Rick
(Continuing to Rinaldo)
Remember, Luis, he wasn't in this.

. Rinaldo
He does not interest me.

Sam
(Who sees the gun, and stops)
Whut's de trouble, boss? .

Rick
No trouble, Sam. The Captain and [ want to hear a little
music. Get over to the piano, but take care when you step
across the line of fire.

Sam
(Perplexed, but obeying)
. :

Yaesuh
Rinaldo

May 1 go now? I do not wish to listen to music.
Rick

No.
Rinaldo

But this ia absurd, They have left. There is no reason for
holding me here,

Rick
Just for a little while, Luis, There's still the telerhone t
Ea22

Rick (Cont)
(The RABBIT has seated hinself at
piano and starts to improvise rather
softly)
Louder, and faster, Sam, Make it hot.
(The RABEIT increases the tempo, swinging
very loud and fast. Music swells, gets

wilder)
Rinaldo
(Hysterically)
Must you play}
Rick

Keep playing, Sam.

(The RABBIT obeys, and suddenly the sound
of a plane motor cuts across the noise of
iano. Both RiCK and RINALDO lool up.
fhe musie stops)

Rinaldo
The Lisbon plane,

tay

Rick -
And that lets you out.
(Befora sither of them can move, the
door bursts open and STRASSER rushes
in. He is in a towering rage)

Strasser
You imbecile! You stupid swine! ‘They're gone] They wore
on that plano!

Rinaldo
I imow it.

. Strasser

And your fine neutral here, He'g responsible,
(Then he sees the gun and checks, RICK
takes the gun and points it very deliber-
ately at Strasser)

Rick
At the present moment, I am debeting very seriously with ny~
self the question of killing you. I don't sve any reason wht
I shouldn't, except -- that I have never killed a TEN.
(He throws the gun econtomptuously on
table. SYRASSER leaps for it and
covers Rick)

Strasser
You are under arrest.

Rick
(Coolly)
Not really.
(He rises slorly, Tho RABBIT watches him
with agonized eyes
Strasser
Ioan waiting,

Rick
(Starts walking slowly towards door)
So long, Sam, I'd go over to the Blue Parrot, if I were you
Fis he passes Rinaldo, who has not moved)

Rinaldo
Why did you do it, Rick?

Rick
(Pausing)
For the folding money, Luis, for the folding money. You owe
me five thousand francs,

(RICK walks out with STRASSER as the
