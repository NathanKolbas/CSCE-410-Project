“THE TOY"

By
Carol Sobiesky

2nd Draft
February 14, 1982
FADE IN:
EXT. HELICOPTER SHOT - MOVING IN ON BATES, LOUISIANA - DAY

The edge of the sun at the horizon. The city glistens in
the midst of the lush farmland and the brown meandering
Mississippi.

The SOUND OF TWO PEOPLE MAKING LOVE, OVER.

HIGH ANGLE SHOT - MOVING IN ON SLUMS

The squalor of black Bates. Trash. Lowriders. Graffiti.
Vacant lots. Boarded-up buildings. Sleazy bars. The

broken beer bottles in that street alone pick up the light
of dawn. Other than that, sleeping cats and deep shadows.

The people making love are getting it together. QUICKENING
BREATHING. An urgency.

COME IN ON WINDOW

in the three-room, clapboard house with a For Sale sign in
front. The paint is peeling, some windows broken, the
curtains limp, the whole house sags to the north, but it's
no worse than all the other houses in the area.

The BREATHING is PUNCTUATED with LITTLE GASPS OF PLEASURE.

INT. HOUSE

The interior walls have been removed, except for the bath-
room it is one large space, oddly livable and nice, amid
poverty. The furniture is Goodwill reject. Fair Housing
picket sign. Law books. A jockstrap. Monet's water
lilies tacked to the stained wallpaper. An old typewriter.
Stacks of yellow paper, full of typing and legal pads

full of handwriting. Bowl:of dried Chinese vegetables,
different gauge pasta and dried flowers. A sink corroded
through, with a wrench for a faucet and a bucket to catch
the leaks. An Air Force exercise chart. A flourishing
philodendron.

The BREATHING is FASTER. WHIMPERS and SIGHS and FANFARE.

ON BED

They fall apart, happy. JACK is a thin man with a beard.
ANGELA is an NYU law school graduate and a vivid beauty.

(CONTINUED)
5 CONTINUED:

ANGELA
How do you feel?

JACK
Saved.

She laughs, snuggles closer.
ANGELA

Your beard is manifestation of a
death wish, Jack, did you know that?

JACK
Sheeit.

ANGELA
Bates considers beards a brand of
communism.

JACK

Why do you carry on like it was a
ten, if it wasn't ten?

ANGELA
Bates owns the town. It's asking
for failure.

Up on his elbow, irritated.
JACK
Now wait a second. I don't have
to suck up to that anybody. I've
got a publisher.
She caresses his beard, deaf.
ANGELA
Shave it off. Take some menial job.
You haven't worked in so long you've
forgotten how.

JACK
Writing a book isn't working?

ANGELA
It would be healthy.

He looks at her owlishly.

JACK
I'm unhealthy?

CONTINUED: (2)

ANGELA
There's a direct correlation
between unemployment and sexual
malfunctioning.

JACK
Was it a nine?

ANGELA
We used up the publishers' advance
six months ago.

JACK
Eight?

ANGELA
We've got to come up with two grand
by the end of the month or we lose
the house, Jack.

Jack remembers suddenly -- goes rigid -- grabs his watch.
JACK

Oh, Jesus. I'm having breakfast
with the Bank in twenty minutes.

Leaps out of bed, stops mid air:

JACK
(continuing)
Seven?
ANGELA
(grins, grudgingly)
And a half.

He leaps back on top of her.
JACK

You are so full of bullshit,
woman...

VERY TIGHT

He looks at her, vibrant with admiration, stunned at his
good luck.

JACK
Let's get married.

She hugs him, abruptly as soft as she was fierce.

(CONTINUED)
6

CONTINUED:

ANGELA
What're you gonna tell the Bank?

JACK

(stroking her hair,

comforting her)
Couple of jokes. It'll be all
right. Bankers have a sense of
humor too.

(looks into her eyes)
If I get an extension of credit,
can we get married?

Long look.

ANGELA
Yep.

He hoots with triumph, sweeps her into his arms.

EXT. JACK'S STREET

Wide, bleak and untended, full of dust and broken promises.
Beat-up pickups. Old cars on blocks in front yards.

Though it is still early, there are people leaning on porch
rails, on cars, hanging out, going nowhere. Jack eases his
old ten speed out of the house. CREDITS.

JACK

swings up onto his bike and starts down the street, avoiding
the potholes and glass and stray dogs. The kids and
neighbors wave greetings. He waves back, settling a green
backpack on his shoulders, riding on, without hands.
Whistling.

DOWNTOWN

Mostly boarded up empty store fronts. Many businesses with
"Bates" in the title. The newspaper building, the Dixie
Daily (A Division of Bates Enterprises), is still in
operation, on the main square. The square itself sports a
larger than life statue of Bates in stone. Jack breezes

by on his bike, whistling, tosses the statue the finger.

STORE

Jack rides through the shadows of early morning still long
from the old fashioned three-story midtown Bates Department
Store.

BATES ENTERPRISES BUILDING

The tallest, newest, most imposing building in town. In
front of which is a free standing sign with "Employment
Opportunities" listed under the Bates motto: "Welfare
Corrupts." Jack breezes by on his bike.

EXT. LA NOISETTE ROSE

Jack rides his bike up a gangplank, hops off. La Noisette
Rose is a restaurant on a paddle wheeler, on the
Mississippi. Open 24 Hours. Chicken Fried Steak our
Specialty! CREDITS END.

INT. LA NOISETTE ROSE

An air of superiority. Views of refineries and muddy river
out the windows. Pink tableclothes, waiters in pink
jackets. A small bowl of pink walnuts on each table.

Most of the customers are middle-aged, florid-faced men
in business suits breakfasting with young blondes in form
fitting jeans, satin blouses with tooled cowboy boots and
the Farah Fawcett hairdos.

Jack Brown is finishing breakfast with a sour looking
BANKER in a three-piece pin striped suit. There is an
awkward silence. Jack sets down his coffee cup with a
clatter.

JACK
Sorry.
(smiles ingratiatingly)
Know why Dolly Parton's feet are
so small?

BANKER
I've heard it.

Jack clears his throat, regroups.

JACK
Heard about the Polish mosquito?

BANKER
Jack, if you don't get a job --

JACK
(to passing waiter)
Check please.

WAITER
Right away, Mussier.

BANKER
Are you listening?

JACK
Ever seen a walnut cracked by a
judo chop?

BANKER
This is important. This is bottom
line --

JACK

(taking a walnut,
shoving his
sleeves up)

This is spectacular.

BANKER
(tight rage)
Jack, you need a paying job by
the end of the week. Or we'll
repossess everything you own,
starting with your goddam
typewriter.

CHOP. The pitcher of cream jumps off the table into the
Banker's lap. He stands, white liquid spread over his
pants front.
JACK
It's just half and half. It'll
wash out --
He grabs his napkin, wipes the man's front making it worse.

BANKER
This is a new suit.

JACK
I'll pay for the cleaning.

BANKER
With what?

JACK
Just send the bill to the house.

The Waiter comes with the check on a little tray. Jack
slips his credit card into the tray. The Waiter starts
away. The Banker tackles him, snatches the credit card
back.

BANKER
You can't use this.

JACK
The bank won't cash my check.

BANKER
Of course not. You're overdrawn.

JACK
(sotto voce)
They don't know that here.

BANKER
But the bank will have to honor
this.

JACK
Exactly.

BANKER

But I just told you. We aren't
extending your credit unless you
get a job.

(digs for his wallet)
I'll pay. Here. How much is it?

The Banker takes the bill off the tray, red-faced with
anger. The Waiter sticks a toothpick in his teeth and
eyeballs the ceiling. Jack takes the bill back.

JACK
I can't allow you to do that. I
invited you. You're my guest. I --
The Banker grabs it back, Jack grabs it back, knocks over
the whole table.
EXT. BATES BUILDING - LATER AM

Jack is on his bike, circling the Employment Opportunities
sign. Stewing, pondering and circling.

ON SIGN

Petroleum Engineer, Computer Programmer, Accountant, etc.
And at the very bottom: Cleaning Woman (Part time).

EXT. BATES BUILDING ENTRANCE

Elegant people coming and going through the polished bronze
and glass revolving doors.

Jack swings off his bike, begins to lock it to the Loading
Zone standard in front of the front door. Next to a
parked Chrysler limousine.

FANCY BATES, a very chic, very voluptuous creature of
about twenty-five, sweeps out of the building, wearing

a full length mink coat, heads for the limo. Behind

her, wringing his hands is GEFFRAN, a balding, blue-suited,
nervous man. Behind him, BARKLEY, the chauffeur.

Jack grins, moves his bike out of her way, opens the door
of the car for her. She smiles at him regally.

FANCY
Why, I do thank you so very much.

JACK
My pleasure, foxy lady.

Barkley shuts the door with care.

ON GEFFRAN AND JACK

Geffran mops his forehead, glancing sideways at Jack and
his lascivious grin.

GEFFRAN
Not for you, pal.

JACK
It's a free country.

GEFFRAN
That's Fancy Bates.

JACK
His daughter?

GEFFRAN

Wife. Numero three.

Geffran winces. Laughing, Jack swings in the door.

INT. OUTER OFFICE

Poster for the Bates Credit Union, sign up sheets for
baseball teams. This is the employment office for Bates
Enterprises. A couple of ancient black women are waiting.
A couple of computer programmers. One engineer. The
tweedy SECRETARY, Wellsley, looks disapprovingly at Jack
who is sitting with the women, his bookbag between his
knees.

He smiles back at her. The Secretary looks at her list.

SECRETARY
Miss Jackie Brown.

Jack gets up, smiles at the Secretary, heads for the door.

SECRETARY
(continuing)
Wait. Not you. We need a part-
time woman.

JACK
(lisping)
I can be a part-time woman.

Wiggles into the office before she can stop him.

INT. VICE PRESIDENT OF PERSONNEL'S OFFICE

SIDNEY MOREHOUSE, the soul of propriety, is looking over
the resume and clippings and articles in Jack's bookbag.

MOREHOUSE
You're what I would call over
qualified, Mr. Brown. What we
want is a woman for three hours
a night to clean around the window

MOREHOUSE
Is this a protest or something?

JACK
No, sir. I need the job.

Morehouse shakes his head, begins to put the articles back

in the bag.
MOREHOUSE
I'm sorry.
JACK
I can do anything a woman can do.
Almost.
MOREHOUSE

No. The answer's no. No now, no
tomorrow. No next week. No next
year.

JACK
What I like about this outfit is
its open mindedness.

MOREHOUSE
I know what Mr. Bates wants. To
be crude, Aunt Jemima. You look
nothing like Aunt Jemima. You
look like trouble. What Mr. Bates
does not want is trouble.

Clippings and awards back in the bookbag. Hands it back
to Jack, smiles.

MOREHOUSE
-(continuing)
Thank you for coming in. Miss
Wellsley will give you a parking
validation.

JACK
My girl friend's trouble, Mr.

It's meant as a threat.

MOREHOUSE
On what grounds could she possibly

JACK
It's illegal to hire a woman if a
more competent man is available

for the job.
MOREHOUSE
More competent in whose opinion?
JACK

I'm not more competent than those

MOREHOUSE
It's a terrible job, Mr. Brown, if
truth be told, you wouldn't like it,

Morehouse smiles, relieved, triumphant.

MOREHOUSE
We're all part of Mr. Bates'
family here. In his family none
of us wears. beards.

ON JACK

Reacting, digging in internally.

INT. KITCHEN

A clean-shaven Jack slides in the door. The kitchen is
bustling with preparations for an elaborate luncheon for
forty people. There are a dozen Aunt Jemima types in

black uniforms, trimmed with white, the traditional white
aprons and lace trimmed caps. RUBY DEE, an immense capable
black, turns with salad tongs and a scowl to Jack.

RUBY DEE
Whoever you want, she's busy.
Come on back about three.

JACK
I'm looking for Ruby Dee.

RUBY DEE
That's me. What about?

INT. CORPORATE DINING ROOM

A long table set for a formal meal, complete with extra
wine glasses, salad plates, butter plates, cold soup
already at each of the forty places.

There are forty executives, mostly men, in three piece
Brooks Brothers suits and ties and conservative haircuts.

The head accountant, Mr. Geffran, comes in from the hallway.

GEFFRAN
(announcing)
Mr. Bates is on his way.

As a body, the executives move toward the table, talking
in modulated, civilized tones. The waitresses come in,
with serving dishes. Morehouse comes in.

MOREHOUSE
He's on the phone to London, five
minutes.

As a body they move away from the table. Ruby Dee comes
in from.the kitchen.

RUBY DEE
He's off the phone. Sit, kids.

(wipes his hands

on his napkin)
What's Bates supposed to do with
his money? Whatever he buys he
corners the market --

Spotting Jack, Morehouse chokes on his soup. Geffran slaps
him on the back.

POV

Midway in the line of waitresses carrying serving dishes,

Jack," in the waitress uniform: the black dress, the white
apron, the trimmed cap. He is carrying a silver dish

full of bread, wrapped in a linen napkin. A crystal bowl

of butter balls on ice.

FULL SHOT

As the women circulate, serving butter, salad, pouring ice
water, wine, etc., no one but Morehouse notices Jack.
After all, he's black and wearing a uniform. Morehouse
glances frantically around the table.

Morehouse loosens his tie, mops his forehead with his
napkin. Jack grins, circles the head of the table,
pulling the head chair back, cutting in between to pass
the bread to the other side of the table.

NEW ANGLE

BATES comes in. Bates is Southern tradition, a good old
boy with a wide stance, a ready smile and lethal eyes.

He wears Brooks Brothers exclusively. Even his underwear
is Brooks Brothers. Talk trails off. Everyone smiles
toward the end of the table. The waitresses move toward
his end, ready to serve him.

BATES
Good. Good. Time is money.

Ruby Dee comes out of the kitchen before he gets to his
chair.

RUBY DEE
Mr. Bates. Phone.

BATES
No calls.

RUBY DEE
It's your son.

INT. DINING ROOM

Bates strides over to the head chair, sits, pulls the
table to him.

ANGLES ON CORPORATE OFFICERS

as the table slides past them, maybe three feet. They
look at it, then at each other, then at Bates, then try
to sort it out without objecting.

ON BATES

Impervious to the chaos he's created, he begins to eat.

ON WAITRESSES

lined up behind him, serving him, one after another.

ON JACK

trying to sort out the plates. Passing them back and
forth, collecting the ones on his arm that no one claims.
And the glasses. And the forks. And the ashtrays.

JACK
Here. I think this one's yours.
It isn't? Sir, did you have a
blueberry muffin? Whose blueberry
muffin is this? What kind of
salad dressing did you have?
Here. Isn't that yours? I think
so. Well just take it, nobody's
got any diseases. How about this
one for you? Does this look like
your fork?

Working his way down the table, collecting more and more
plates that people won't claim, can't find the correct
person for, until O'BRIEN at the end, who is eating in
his lap.

JACK
Like the soup?

O'BRIEN
Very much.

JACK

Want a card table?

O'BRIEN

If it wouldn't be too much trouble.
JACK

Not at all.
O'BRIEN

Thank you, Miss.

Jack heads for the kitchen door. Bates points at him,

BATES
You.

Jack looks behind himself, no one. Then approaches Bates.

JACK
Me?

BATES
Who are you?

JACK

Your new cleaning woman, Mr. Bates.

Bates nods.

BATES
Name?

JACK
Brown. Jack Brown.

BATES

The women I employ, Mr. Brown,
are required to wear hose or
shave their legs. Do you have
three dollars for a pair of

hose?

INT. MEN'S ROOM

Still in his waitress uniform, one foot propped on the
sink, Jack is trying to lather up the hair on his leg
with the soap from the dispenser. Muttering. Then win-
cing as he pulls the disposable razor through the mess.

Other men using the facilities look at him strangely,
then give him wide berth.

Morehouse comes in.

MOREHOUSE
Brown? Good God. What're you
doing?

JACK
Shaving.

MOREHOUSE

Your beard, man, all I meant was
your beard.

JACK
(rinsing the razor)
In the Bates family, we all shave

our legs. Didn't you know? He
told me himself.

Smiles, exits. Morehouse looks after him a moment ,
Then picks up the razor, props his foot on the sink,
slides up his pants.

The door opens, Jack is there.

JACK

There are two black intellectuals, one man and one woman,
each behind desks, on telephones. At the very back,
Angela at her desk which is piled with papers, also on
the phone. There are bookshelves full of lawbooks be-
hind her. Around the walls posters celebrating the
Klanwatch's activities.

Jack is sitting in the chair across from Angela, his
feet up on the desk, pissed.

ANGELA

(into phone, shrill)
Seventy dollars? It's not
possible! What're you lining
them with, spun gold?

(listens, gathers

herself in hand)
Of course do them, you goddam

Five thirty. Yeah, okay.

Hangs up, takes a breath to steady herself, grins at Jack.

ANGELA

I like your chin.

JACK

Wait'll you see my calves.

She comes around her desk, plops into his lap, laughing.

ANGELA
You got a job. That's what's
important. That's what's terrific.

He stares at her. Grins. They kiss.

EXT. BATES DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

The Chrysler limousine arrives. A small boy emerges.
Starts for the front door. Sees the crowd by the window,
walks over. He is wearing a military school uniform.
ERIC BATES, nine-years-old, thin, self-assured and
arrogant.

INT. STORE WINDOW - NIGHT

Jack is running the vacuum cleaner around the lingerie
exhibit, four mannequins in bras and teddies and bikinis
in a bathroom set. By accident, he knocks against a
mannequin with the vacuum cleaner hose. She topples
over, crashing into the others, they fall like a house
of cards, one smashing her hand on the vanity table.

EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT

A fascinated crowd.

INT. WINDOW

Jack has set two mannequins upright but in lifting #3
he knocks them over again. Looks, pained, at the mess
around him, spots the broken hand. Picks it up. In
doing so the vacuum cleaner cord becomes entangled, he

Eric comes in, followed by a phalanx of blue-suited
managers.

MOVING SHOT - GEFFRAN AND TOY MANAGER (O'BRIEN)
follow, muttering to each other.
GEFFRAN
Why do I have to stay for this?
I'm accounting. Is he going to
exceed his credit limit?
O'BRIEN
It's always the toy department.
I wish he'd grow up. I wish he'd
get interested in stereos.
NEW ANGLE
Eric stops. The men pile up behind him. The boy watches
as Jack, unaware of his audience, tries to unscrew
another mannequin's hand, with no success.
JACK
Give me a hand you tight-assed
broad.

hand trying to find a loose hand. The child and his re-

watching.

TOY DEPARTMENT

Jack finds himself in the display of life-sized stuffed
figures of superheros from the movies. He knocks Batman
over by accident. Picks him up.

JACK
Sorry, Bat.

Pats him on the shoulder. The Batman collapses again.
Jack tucks the mannequins hand into his back pocket, sets
up the Batman again.

JACK
(continuing)
On your feet, klutz.
Bat collapses again. Jack lets out a sigh -- props him
against Wonder Woman -- they nearly tip over -- he drags

Superman into a sort of tri-pod arrangement.
JACK
(continuing; to

Wonder Woman)
Live it up, darling.

ERIC

in the shadows turns to the blue-suited men behind him.

Well, I would.
O'BRIEN

I don’t want him throwing a
tantrum in my department, please,

JACK
I don't give a damn where he
throws his tantrum. The answer's

O'Brien thumbs out four more fifties, slowly, then tucks
them into Jack's pocket.

FEATURING ERIC
as O'Brien propels Jack over to the child.
- O'BRIEN
The gentleman will be delighted,
Eric. His name is Jack Brown.
Jack, this is Master Bates.

Jack does a take, no one else seems to have heard. He
extends his hand. Eric ignores it.

ERIC
I'll call him nigger.

JACK
And I'll call you prick.

Stunned silence. Then the child smiles.

ERIC
Wrap him up.

JACK
What?!

Eric's eyes flick dangerously toward the toy manager. He
loosens his tie, sighs, takes Jack aside again.

Jack is boiling. O'Brien soothing.
O'BRIEN
We'll make you very comfortable.

Mr. Brown, my house is mortgaged,
twice, my wife's parents live
with us. Her father is on
dialysis, and even with Medicare,
lemme tell you, it's a helluva
struggle. One word from the boy
and I'll lose my job.

Jack glares at the child a moment.

JACK
He needs a good whipping.

O'BRIEN
(another $50 into
Jack's pocket)
I really don't care what you do
to him once you get there.

Jack looks at him.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

as a large elegant Bates Department Store van sweeps under
the flowing cottonwoods along the drive up to the two-
story house.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The boy is sitting at the end of a long formal table,
eating alone, except for a hatchet-faced MADEMOISELLE at
his side, doing needlepoint. He's eating his peas one by
one. He has not touched his liver. Or his sweet potatoes.
He is leaning on his elbow, profoundly bored.

MADEMOISELLE

(in French)
Elbows off the table.

(nothing; in French)
Sit up, Eric.

(mothing; in French)
Our stomachs will digest our food
better if we eat some vegetable,
some meat and some starch, in
that order. Not all the
vegetable at one time --

ERIC

MADEMOISELLE

I understand nothing but French.

ERIC
I hate French.

With a drink in his hand, Bates comes in as Mademoiselle
is about to blow her stack. She settles quickly. Bates
sits next to Eric, whiskey at hand. Eric plays with the
peas on his plate.

BATES
So, how are you?

ERIC
Okay.

BATES
How's school?

ERIC
Okay.

BATES
Who are your friends?

ERIC
Dunno.

BATES
What classes do you enjoy?

ERIC
Dunno.

BARKLEY
Excuse me. Eric, your present

Eric leaps to his feet, knocking over his chair, running
toward the door. Mademoiselle springs to her feet,
outraged.

MADEMOISELLE
(in French)
Not until you eat your liver!

BATES
(overlapping)
Eric!

Eric ignores them both, flies out of the room. Bates
sighs, downs his drink,

INT. PLAYROOM

The boy bursts in the door. It is a magnificent room,
large and full of toys, a fort built of huge blocks of
styrofoam, covered in bright-covered cloth and velcro, an
electric train systems, a space shuttle device that hangs
in the air, a Superman hang glider suspended from the
ceiling, an air hockey game, slot machines, pinball
machines, computers, typewriters. And in the middle of
this, a wooden packing crate, dwarfed by the size and
opulence of the room.

Eric walks over to the box, touches it, a smile of triumph
on his face.

Mademoiselle appears in the doorway.

MADEMOISELLE

Mademoiselle jumps a foot. Bates appears in the doorway.

BATES
Eric --

ERIC
She won't help me open my present.
She won't get me a hammer.

MADEMOISELLE
He hasn't touched his liver.

JACK'S VOICE
Help!

Bates blinks, approaches.

BATES
What's this?

Eric avoids his father's eyes.

ERIC
You said I could have anything
in the store.

JACK'S VOICE
Would someone let me out of here!

Eric finally meets his father's eyes. Silence.

Can you hear me in there?
JACK'S VOICE
Yes, sir.
BATES
Who are you?
JACK

The new part-time cleaning lady,
sir. At the store. Jack Brown.

BATES
How did this happen?

JACK'S VOICE
I was doing my job, minding my
business. Your son came along
and asked them to wrap me up.
Which they did.

Bates paces, avoiding the boy's eyes, then whirls on him

furious.
BATES
I hope you have an explanation
of this.
ERIC

You said anything in the store.
He was in the store.

JACK'S VOICE
Sir --

BATES
She's just coming with the hammer.

Mademoiselle returns with the hammer, hands it to Bates.

ERIC
(taking the hammer)
I get to open it. It's my
present.

He pries t!-2 néi?s’out, folds the top back with a
SCREECHING OF NAILS. Jack stands stiffly, excelsior
dripping from his hair, styrofoam clinging to his clothes.

(CONTINUED)

58 CONTINUED: (3)

He impales the boy with a look, puts his hands on the edges
of the box and jumps out, angry, with himself mostly.
JACK
What the hell, for another couple
of bucks I'd probably do it naked.

Heads for door.
BATES
Sir --
JACK
Naked, sir.
BATES
I mean come here a minute.
JACK
Forget it.
Continues toward the door. Eric lobs a FIRECRACKER. It
EXPLODES in front of Jack, who falls flat on his face.
The boy, to his side, laughing.
— ERIC
We can have lots of fun, you and
me.
BATES
I'll pay you on an hourly basis.
JACK

I'd forgotten. The one thing I
hate worse than white people is
rich white people.

Heads for the door again.

Jack stops in the hall, faces the whale of a man.

JACK

I am, too. I'm a newspaperman,
Mr. Bates. I been without a job
in this town for a year because
you own the paper and you don't
hire blacks. Unless they do
windows. And wait tables. And
kiss ass.

(beat, grins)
I just tried it. I don't like
it. -

Heads down the hall again. Bates beside him.
BATES

I only have him for a week,
every year.

JACK
Get a better lawyer. You
shouldn't have to have him that

much.
BATES

I love him, Mr. Brown.
JACK

I don't care!
BATES

He wants you to stay.

JACK
He doesn't. He wants to see if
you can make me stay. It's a
power play. Manipulative little
bastard.

BATES
If you were less hysterical, Mr.
Brown, you might suggest that I
pay you for the week, what I pay
my reporters. A thousand dollars.

JACK

For babysitting?

Bates smiles, lethal. Jack looks down the hall at the
kid, in exactly the same position as his father. Then back
at the man.

JACK
(continuing; stunned)
Is it inherited or contagious?

BATES
(smiles)
Come down to my office.

INT. BATES OFFICE

Freestanding models of the Bates stores with a profit/loss
chart attached to each. Posters charting the demographics
of the area: buying power per capita per county, driving
habits, gas prices, advertising dollars, etc. On the wall
facing Bates' desk, a blowup of the region with golden TV
towers indicating each of his cable networks and golden
threads connecting them to the central and tallest tower

in Bates. On the wall behind the desk, life-sized portrait
of Fancy as the Naked Raja, but with a string Bikini-bottom
in the shape of a heart over the critical area. Bates has
his confederate flag standing discreetly in front of the
boobs.

Bates sinks into his leather chair, waves at Jack to take
the chair across from him.

One look at Fancy, peeking out from behind the flag, Jack
averts his eyes and slides over to the chair, trying not
to look at the painting, and at the same time, look at
Bates. An impossibility.

Bates watches him squirm a moment, then opens a box of
cigars, passes them over.

BATES
I believe Eric sees more of me in
this one week than he sees of his
mother all year.

JACK
This isn't by choice?

BATES
This is why I'm willing to pay
you a thousand dollars to visit
with us here. This is why I want
him to have whatever he wants.
This will all be his someday.

Jack clears his throat, takes a cigar, keeping his eyes
on the floor.

JACK
Let's start at fifteen hundred,
work up from there.

BATES
You're not a newspaper man,
you're a crook.

JACK
I'd take five hundred and a job
on the paper.

BATES

There isn't a job on the paper.
JACK

Two thousand.
BATES

You're irritating me.
Jack smiles, flicks the ash of his cigar in a Stuben hand.

BATES
(continuing)
That's not an ashtray.

JACK
And what we're talking about's
not a job. It's an insult.

Bates dumps the ashes in the wastebasket, shoves over an
ashtray.

Two thousand. For which you will
wipe his ass if he wants you to.

Jack smiles.

Jack looks him square in the eye.

JACK

You only have him for a week.
You spend three grand on a piece
of jewelry for her --

(waves at the painting)
-- and never think twice about
it. But you won't spend it on
your son? Nice guy.

Bates is around the desk, Jack's shirt in his fist.

BATES
(through clenched
teeth)
Don't mess with me.

JACK
Two thousand five hundred'd be
fine. Generous. Wonderful...

Bates drops him, heads back to his desk. Jack adjusts
his jacket, eases out the door.

the top of the carpeted stairs, cut too quickly, the car
rolls down the carpeted stairs, Jack screaming, Eric

across the front hall. Food, silverware, glasses fly in
every direction.

dressed in bright red Spiderman pajamas. Scowling at
one oversized toy after another, hanging from the
ceiling, piled up against the wall, oppressive. The
pinball machines, air hockey, trains, slot machines,
phone booth, word processors. He gets to his feet,
wanders among it all, hands behind his back, pacing.

JACK
No, Mommy I do not want

Eric whirls on him, red faced with anger.

he won't come back no matter how
much you pay him and I don't want
to stay here if he's not here
‘cause I don't have anyone to

Silence. Locusts. It is an everyday defeat, a minor moment
of sadness, but this is a first for Eric. He edges over
closer to Jack and takes his hand.

Jack looks down at him, astonished.

EXT. BREAKS AND BRACKEN - SUNSET

Eric and Jack, carrying their gear, head up through the rough
country toward the house on the hill above. Jack panting
like a furnace, giving wide berth to bushes over an inch
tall.

ERIC
We could get even. We could tell.

JACK
Who? God? Hey God, life's unfair.
Hey Eric, tough titty.

ERIC

JACK
We're not writing a newspaper.

complete with flash.

JACK
This goes here. This should be on
this button when you're taking

Stands aside. The boy lifts the camera.

JACK

And focus on her face. Or you'll

Eric giggles, continues to focus.

ERIC
Move that flag.

Jack rounds the desk, moves the Confederate flag. Fancy's
boobs are truly munificent, excessive works of art.

Eric lowers the camera to see if what he's seeing is correct.
He and Jack exchange an astonished grin. Eric takes the
picture. Jack replaces the flag.

JACK
Better take a PG version, Eric.

hat with a pencil stuck in the band, like Front Page. The
boy twists around, takes the hat, puts it on his own head.

ERIC
I want to be the editor. I want
to call you Scoop, Scoop.

Jack takes the hat back.

JACK
I'm the one knows the newspaper

Eric takes the hat back.

What're we celebrating?

JACK
Hey --

ERIC

Monday morning my father's gonna
tell you to take off your pants in
front of the world and you're gonna
do it.

(beat)
He treats people like turds, Jack,
didn't you read our paper, didn't
you hear what those people said,
didn't you want to kick Mr.
Morehouse in the nuts?

(anger in his

voice, liquid eyes)
Headline... Jack Brown sold out
today to Hank Bates. As expected.

JACK
You're the one who said we'd stop!
I said no!

ERIC

You didn't mean it. You can't
wait to start work Monday.

Jack grabs him. Nearly an accident. They are on a
street corner.

JACK
You want me to starve? Can I pay
for groceries with high-handed
principles? It's fine for you,
growing up, to believe in truth
and justice and the American way,
but once you're grown up you play
grown-up games.

ERIC
You could've come to Houston with
me.
JACK
(angry)

As your shoeshine boy?

ERIC
As my friend!

The old VW bus with the Klanwatch logo on the side lurches
around the corner to park in the red. Angela leaps out.

ANGELA
Jack!
Embrace.
JACK
Angel. Meet Eric Bates. My friend
Eric Bates.

Angela grabs Eric by the arm, shakes him.

ANGELA
You're the one? What gives you
the idea that you can buy people!
You spoiled little --

Jack pulls her off.

JACK
Cool it, he --

ANGELA
Someone needs to give him a

Ease off.

It's okay what he's done to you?

JACK
He got me a job, Ange, writing
news for the Dixie Daily. Starting
Monday,

Angela looks from one to the other.

JACK
(continuing)
Nobody's happy. Except me.

ANGELA
We're picketing his house tomorrow.

You're what?

ANGELA

His Daddy's having a fundraiser
for the Klan's Youth Camps.

JACK
A new TV series. The family's
named Klutz. The oldest boy's
name is Klu. The father dies.
Klu is left with the Klan: five
handsome, square-jawed, narrow-
hipped brothers, two bosomy
liquid-eyed sisters who sing
country-western. It's like the
Dukes of Hazzard. They drive
around the South in a truck
picking up trash. Avenging
vacuum cleaners.

ERIC
They hate blacks.

JACK
And Jews and Catholics and Quakers
and Communists and punk rockers.
They hate almost everybody.

ERIC
They kill blacks.
JACK
Why did you ask if you already
knew?
ERIC
Are you gonna picket?
JACK
I usually do.

But you won't tomorrow, right?
"Cause if you do, Daddy'll fire

The machine hits the jackpot. Money spews into the cup,

then onto the floor. Eric just looks at it awhile, then

shoves his hands into his pockets, walks over to the day-
bed, sits on the floor, leaning back against the daybed,

playing the Rubic's Cube.

ERIC
When I was little I had this friend.
We'd play at school and after school
and weekends and he'd beat up people
for me. And he'd spit at girls and
let the air out of teacher's tires
and flood the rest rooms.

JACK
Somebody worthy of you.

ERIC
I told Mama about him and she sent
me to a shrink. He said I was too
old to have imaginary friends.

Jack takes the Rubic's Cube, adjusts it, hands it back.

JACK
Shrinks piss on the world.

ERIC
Grownups piss on the world.

JACK
Now wait a minute. You got my
phone number. You can call me
when you come back next year. I'm
not imaginary, Eric.

Yeah, you are. The Jack Brown I
knew was a world-class nigger.

INT. FANCY'S ROOM - DAY

Bates is pacing, snorting, furious, dressed in his
elegant best. Fancy is in her minimums at the makeup
table, doing a number on her face. The newspaper is on
the edge of the table under her chiffon negligee.

FANCY
Do you like this new metallic
eyeshadow, sugar, or does it
look like Hookercity?

BATES
I'm losing my son.

FANCY
What?

BATES
Jack Brown's taking my son away
from me.

FANCY
Big deal.

BATES
Fancy.

FANCY

Well fire him, darling, if he
bothers you.

BATES
I gave him a job on the paper.

She sighs, prettily, uses the powder puff.

FANCY
Men are so mysterious.

BATES
It's the best way to bring him
to heel. To shut him up.
Fancy blinks her big eyes at him.

FANCY
Hank, your prostate.

Bates mops his forehead with her negligee, notices the
paper, wads it up, hurls it into the basket.

The back gardens of the house are terraced down the slope
to the river.

Many different levels, each decorated with bunting. At
the bottom, the Juilliard String Quartet is playing under
a tent, with a dance floor. On another level a table full
of information on the Klan's Youth Corps. Sign-ups and
pledges.

The Cadillacs and Mercedeses are simply parked in the
pasture next to the gardens. The women hike up their
chiffon, walk through the cockleburs and goat heads.

The garden itself shimmers with elegance. Two hundred
people Neisman's dressed. Liveried waiters. Buffet tables
that are works of art. Everything in red, white and blue.

The String Quartet breaks off abruptly, mid-Mozart. They
swing into DIXIE.

ON FRENCH DOORS

at the top of the gardens, leading out of the house. The
GOVERNOR comes out. He shakes hands with Bates. He is
yet another good old boy with a ready smile, a beer belly
and lethal slitty eyes. His WIFE, like Fancy, is very
young, very decorative, very plastic.

BATES
Governor. I'm real glad you could
make it.

GOVERNOR

What charity you raising money
for today, Hank?

BATES
You remember Fancy?

She wiggles up to him, thoroughly distracting him.

GOVERNOR
(kisses her)
Sure do. I knew Fancy before you
knew Fancy, Hank.

BATES
Now wait a second.

GOVERNOR
(laughing)
When she was a little bitty thing
in Amarillo. I loved the propellers
on her bosoms.

I'll be damned!

GOVERNOR

wife forward)
Now, Hank, I believe you've
known Charlene just about forever.

Bates kisses her.

BATES
Still on penicillin, sugar?

CHARLENE
For the peace of mind it brings
me, darlin’.

GOVERNOR
Was it the City of Hope?

Bates pulls an innocuous little man into the group, waves
at the photographers.

BATES
Take a picture with the Governor,
Sam.

The Governor puts his arm around the man, smiles, flash.
Bates pulls the man away. Moves close to the Governor.

BATES
(continuing)
You know who that was, Governor?

GOVERNOR
Looked familiar. A friend of
yours?

BATES
Grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan.

The Governor's face turns ashen.

replaces them in the silver tray.

Eric, dressed as the Roadrunner, riding the motorcycle,
pursued by Jack dressed as Wily Coyote, driving the red
Ferrari, his knees to his chin, hunched over the wheel.
They streak through the party. The chiffoned ladies and

astonished. They return to their bourbon and branch as

when they ZOOM off again. Bates turns on his heel and
follows. As does Barkley.

BARKLEY
They're on their way, sir, did you
want them to take all the blacks, sir?

BATES
Of course.

BARKLEY
Including Mister Brown, sir? I

it would be less obtrusive.

Grab a sign.

the Ferrari, does a terrific death scene as the picket
team watches, in ‘patent disbelief.

ERIC

Angela! Hil

In his death rattle, Jack draws a hidden pistol and FIRES
at the boy. Eric looks around. Jack FIRES AGAIN. Then
blows down the barrel of the gun. Eric does a magnifi-

a drop from either his glass or the bottle. He struggles
up, glares at the horse, decides to get on, cannot
without hands. Falls over the other side. Jack picks
him up.

as it skids around in a circle, then screams out of the
private airfield.

EXT. AIRPORT

The limo dodges and darts in and out of the clogged traffic.
Way ahead, the boy gets in the back of a cab and slams
the door. The cab pulls into the traffic.

INT. LIMO

in snarled traffic. Bates opens an elegant, small leather
phone book from his vest pocket. Picks up the phone.
Dials.

BATES
Mr. Brown. Hank Bates, here. The
boy, uh, Eric has run away. I
suppose he's coming to you. I
would appreciate it if you would
keep him there for me. I'll be
there in a minute.

EXT. SLUM STREET

The cab pulls up. Jack, bareheaded, is pacing back and
forth in front of the building, angry. The boy gets out.

ERIC
Can you pay him? TI don't have
any money.

Jack leans into the cab, pays, then turns to the boy in
a fury.

JACK
"Run away'? What's this shit
about ‘running away'?

: ERIC
I want to stay with you.

Jack looks at him in dismay. Around the corner wheels
the limo.

ERIC
No!

Jack pulls the boy out from where he is hiding behind him.
He drags him, kicking and screaming to the car, during:

JACK
He's your father, you gotta live
with that, you gotta deal with
that, you gotta quit hiding behind
me!

Opens the car door, throws him in.

JACK

(cont inuing)
I'm sick of the Bateses, father
and son. Sick of you. You're
nothing but trouble. I don't
want to see either one of you
ever again!

(to Bates)
Understand?

(to Eric)
Understand?!

Bates shakes his hand.
BATES
Thank you.
INT. LIMO - MOVING SHOT

as it drives slowly through the slum streets, full of
litter and blacks in doorways.

BATES

You see.

(beat)
You just thought he was your
friend.

(beat)
I'm the one who's really your
friend.

The limo rolls to a stop at a stop sign. Eric grabs the
handle of the door, yanks it open, jiumps out.

ERIC

is nearly hit as a lowrider skids around the corner.
Eric dodges it, onto the sidewalk, tumbling around
people, vaulting over garbage cans, crashing through,
sprinting through.

FULL

As Eric barrels down the street toward Jack, Bates steps
out of the car.

(yells, meaning it)
No!

Eric skids to a stop.

TIGHT ON ERIC

his face streaked with tears and anger and confusion.
He looks back to his father.

BATES
stops in his tracks, a half a block away.

BATES
I love you!

FULL

The boy looks back and forth, one to the other, then
finally screams at his father.

ERIC
Is it true? That I'll have the
stores and the oil and the TV
stations and everything?

BATES
It's true.

ERIC
And more power than the Ayatollah?

BATES
Nearly.

ERIC
Enough so's I can make anyone
around here do anything I want?

BATES
Absolutely.

ERIC
Then. Drop. Your. Pants. Daddy.

High noon city. Bates profoundly embarrassed, but re-
fusing to look the liar in front of his kid, unbuckles
his pants and drops them. He wears boxer shorts, printed
with the Lacoste alligator.

ERIC

smiles in triumph, turns on his heels and walks toward
Jack.

FULL

As the kid approaches, Jack unsnaps his jeans and drops
them around his ankles.

The boy stops, angry, looks back at his father, who lifts
his shoulders. Then at his black friend, who lifts his.

TIGHT ON ERIC

who unbuckles his uniform belt, drops his pants.

ON CROWD

murmuring, bewildered, confused, amused, applauds.

ANGLE IN STREET

The three of them, arms around each other's waists, head
for the limo, taking mincing little steps, their pants
around their ankles, laughing.

ON BARKLEY

who covers his eyes.
