FADE IN:

OVER OPENING TITLES

1 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 1
A large sign on the entrance wall reads: "MASON MARINE BOAT
SALES." Underneath, another sign reads: "GIGANTIC BLOWOUT
SALE."

A dozen 17-25 foot powerboats are evenly spaced in a neat
line -- family boats, fishing boats, small cabin cruisers,
and ski boats. The boats are all spotless and shine in the
afternoon sun. The boats are marked with balloons and signs:
"ON SALE," "THIS WEEKEND ONLY," "ONE OF A KIND."

2 INT. MASON MARINE - RETAIL SPACE - DAY 2

A large whiteboard displays monthly sales figures. "C.J."
has sold more than the other three salesmen combined.

C.J. MASON writes on the whiteboard. Three salesmen sit at
a table watching him. C.J. is the owner of Mason Marine.
He's around 40, fit, white smile.

Behind C.J. are several black and white pictures of he and *
his father fishing - one picture when C.J. is a young boy

holding a toy TUG BOAT, one picture where C.J. is a teenager,

and one more recent picture.

Meet FRANK, 50ish, bearded, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, and
stuffing a bear claw in his mouth; STEVE, looks like Neil
Diamond in a shirt and tie; and KYLE, early 20's, spiked,
frosted hair.
C.J.
You've got to create urgency with the
customer.
C.J. talks with a lot of intensity. He writes "Create
Urgency" on the whiteboard and underlines it three times.
3 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 3
Kyle and a customer, DEAN, walk around a 19-foot fishing boat. *
KYLE
You've got time. This thing's been
here for like six months.
C.J. steps up next to Kyle.

C.J.
Actually, I have someone coming in
this afternoon to put a deposit on
this boat. We've got some other ones
if you want to look at those?

DEAN
No, I kind of like this one.

C.J.
Well, my customer is coming at two,
so if you decide you want it, let me
know before then.

Dean looks at his watch.

4 INT. MASON MARINE - RETAIL SPACE - DAY
C.J. writes "Begin Negotiation" on the whiteboard.

C.J.
Every customer is a buyer, no matter
what they say. Buyers are liars.
You just have to decide on a price.

5 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 5
Steve and ADAM look at a 20-foot ski boat.
STEVE
This big bad boat is twelve thousand
nine hundered and ninty-nine dollars.
Do you want to pay with cash or

credit card?

ADAM
I really can't afford that much.

Adam turns to leave. C.J. steps in.
C.J.
Suppose I could sell you this boat
for a dollar? Would you take it
right now?

Adam turns back and looks at C.J. and Steve.

ADAM
Yeah, let's hook it up to my truck.

6 MOMENTS LATER 6

Steve, C.J. and Adam look at the boat, which is now hooked up
to Adam's truck.

C.J.
Looks good, doesn't it?

ADAM
It sure does.

C.J.
Now of course I can't sell it to you
for a dollar. But what price did you
have in mind?

ADAM
I was looking to spend around ten
thousand dollars.

C.J.
What if I could make it happen for
two fifty a month, would you take
this boat home today?

Adam rings his hands together nervously and thinks for a
moment.

C.J.
What about two forty a month?

8 INT. MASON MARINE - RETAIL SPACE - DAY 8

C.J. writes "Follow Through" on the whiteboard and underlines
it four times.

C.J.

Follow through is everything in

sales. If you're not going to follow

through, you might as well not even

be here.
Frank takes a bite of his bear claw and NODS, clearly off in
space.

9 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 9

Frank and PATRICK look at a 17' bass boat.

PATRICK

Frank turns and starts walking away. C.J. moves up next to
Frank and turns him back around towards Patrick.

C.J.
Is your wife home now? Let's drive
over and show it to her.

PATRICK
I think it would be better if I
talked to her first.

C.J.
Okay. Let me get your phone number.
I've got someone coming to look at
the boat this afternoon. If they
don't buy it, I'll give you a call.

Patrick NODS.

C.J.
What did your wife say?
(and)
I'm sorry to hear that. Is she there
now?
(and)

Could I talk to her?

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 12

C.J. continues to talk into his headset. He puts the gas
nozzle into his tank and gets back into his truck, still
talking.

C.J.

Yeah, I understand. I've been there
myself. You have to remember, you're
buying more than a boat. You're
buying memories for your family.

(and)
Some of my best childhood memories
are being out with my dad on our 1956
Bell Boy.

I'll even throw in a Wave Raider tube

with. They'll love it.

C.J. sees the gas nozzle dangling from his car. Without

missing a beat, he pulls it out and drops it into the trash
can.

C.J. and his family eat dinner. C.J. continues to talk on
the phone.

His family consists of his two sons, TOMMY (age 8), TYLER
(age 6), and his wife, MADELINE (age 35), who's pregnant.

The house is quite small, and the dining room area is merely
an extension of the living room.

C.J.
(into phone)
Sometimes me and my wife take the
boat out for a romantic weekend
without the kids.

MADELINE
(sotto)
You must mean your other wife.

TOMMY
Why is daddy on the phone so much?

MADELINE
He's a hyperactive, neurotic,
pathological salesman.

C.J. motions for them to be quiet.

16 INT. C.J.'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 16

The bedroom is tiny. C.J. and Madeline lie in bed. C.J.
continues to talk on the phone. Madeline picks up her cell
phone and dials -- C.J. doesn't notice.

C.J.

Congratulations. You're going to be
so happy with this boat.

Could you hold on a second? I have
a call on the other line.

I made the sale.

Steve starts clapping. Kyle and Frank join in with him,
although Frank's effort is half-hearted at best.

STEVE
You're amazing, just amazing. That's
a great sale, man.

C.J.
So let's make this our best month
ever. Anyone who pulls a hat trick
gets a two hundred and fifty dollar
cash bonus.

18 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 18
Steve talks to a young hip customer, BILL.

STEVE
This is a great boat. I can just see
you cruising through the harbor in
this thing, everyone looking at you,
all the chicks asking you for a ride.
I could go out with you and be your
wingman. The Stevester and Bill out
on the water.

BILL
Oh, yeah, sure. Listen I have to
run. I have to meet my fiancee for
dinner.

STEVE
Oh, a romantic dinner? So you're
setting her up for a little bit of
the old in and out?

Steve PUMPS his hips back and forth.

19 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - DAY 19
Frank talks to a MIDDLE-AGED CUSTOMER.

A badminton net is set up in the middle of the huge backyard.

C.J. and Tyler are on one side of the net and Tommy and KEVIN
HOFFERMAN are on the other side. Kevin is Madeline's father.
He's around sixty-five and in great shape, with a tattoo of

an eagle on his forearm.

Tommy whacks the shuttlecock over to the other side of the

net and it hits the ground.

MR. HOFFERMAN
Nice shot, Tommy! You're not like
your father. You're a winner!

C.J.
Don't listen to your grandfather,
Tommy. He's an insecure, egomaniac
who resents me because I have a
career that I'm passionate about.

MR. HOFFERMAN

He's right, Tommy. I wish I'd barely
gotten by selling used boats instead
of fighting for our freedom and then
having a very successful career in
banking and vacationing in Europe.
Not to mention a real house to raise
my family in.

C.J.
Aren't you late for your next
cocktail?

Mr. Hofferman serves the shuttlecock hard and it hits C.J. in

the chest.

Ouch!

MR. HOFFERMAN

push-ups.

MR. HOFFERMAN
Tyler, come over here. You're a
winner, too. You just ended up on
the wrong team.

Tyler runs over to Tommy and Mr. Hofferman and starts doing
push-ups. Mr. Hofferman jumps up from doing his push-ups.

MR. HOFFERMAN
Hooah!

TOMMY AND TYLER
Hooah!

Madeline and MRS. HOFFERMAN exit the house. Mrs. Hofferman
carries a cocktail and hands it to Mr. Hofferman.
MR. HOFFERMAN
There's an open house across the
street. Since you're so successful
selling used boats, why don't we go
take a look at it.

C.J.
That sounds like a fantastic idea.

MR. HOFFERMAN
Great. Let's go.

As Mr. Hofferman turns away, C.J. scratches his forehead with
his middle finger.
22 EXT. PACIFIC HEIGHTS - STREET - DAY 22

C.J., Madeline, Tommy, Tyler, and Mr. and Mrs. Hofferman walk

C.J., Madeline, Tommy, Tyler, and Mr. and Mrs. Hofferman
enter.

A huge chandelier hangs down from the second story. A large
staircase leads up. The house is elegant and enormous.

JOHNNY CROSS (age 35), the realtor, tall and handsome,
strides towards them oozing used car salesman charm.

JOHNNY
How are you folks today?

MRS. HOFFERMAN
Fine, thank you. We live across the
street, but wanted to bring our
daughter and son-in-law over to see
the place.

MR. HOFFERMAN
They really can't afford it. He
sells used boats.

JOHNNY
Actually, you might be surprised.
There are some very creative loan
options out there.

MR. HOFFERMAN
You'd have to be Michelangelo to
create that loan.

C.J.
I sell a lot of boats, and we have
considerable equity in our house.

INT. FANCY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 25

Johnny, C.J., Mr. and Mrs. Hofferman, Madeline, Tyler, and
Tommy enter. The living room is every bit as elegant as the
rest of the house, with a huge sprawling kitchen on one side
and a great living area on the other. Two french doors lead
out to a huge backyard.

MADELINE
What ungodly amount of money are they
asking?

JOHNNY

Seven and a quarter. The phone
hasn't stopped ringing since they
listed it. I'm tempted to buy it
myself and flip it.

Johnny pulls a mini-football out of his briefcase.

JOHNNY
Hey, kids. Why don't you go outside
and throw the football around. It's
a great backyard.

TOMMY AND TYLER
Yeah!

Johnny tosses the football to Tommy as they run outside.

MRS. HOFFERMAN
I'll keep an eye on them.

Mrs. Hofferman goes out after them.

MR. HOFFERMAN

MADELINE

What is your current payment?

C.J.
Around eighteen hundred per month.

JOHNNY
So if I could get you into this house
for around the same amount, you'd put
in an offer today?

C.J.
Yeah, I guess.

JOHNNY
How much equity do you have in your
house?

C.J.

About a hundred thousand.

Johnny whips out a calculator and starts inputting numbers.

JOHNNY
If you could put down one-fifty, and
placed an offer of seven hundred, and
took a fifty year mortgage, your
payment would only be around twenty-
four hundred. That's pretty close to
your current payment.

MADELINE
Not really.

C.J.
A fifty year mortgage? I'm forty-one
years old.

MADELINE
I'm sorry, but we can't afford this

C.J. looks out the window at Tommy and Tyler throwing the
football around the huge backyard.

Madeline gives her father a look. He looks away and starts

MADELINE
What are you going to do?

C.J.
I'm going to hire some new guys who

MADELINE
You've been saying that for five
years. You're too nice. You're

C.J.

They'll either sell or they won't

real estate?

JOHNNY
It's not about the money. I've got
plenty. I just want to do something
I enjoy for a change.

STEVE
Let's see if he can sell to Harvey.

C.J.
Great idea. If you can sell a boat
to Harvey, you got the job.

35 OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT

Johnny approaches Harvey.

JOHNNY
Hello, welcome to Mason Marine.

HARVEY
Thanks. Are you new?

JOHNNY
I started today. How can I help you?

HARVEY
I want to take a trip to Mexico ina
boat I bought for a hundred dollars,
but the gas tank isn't big enough.
I was thinking of constructing a raft
and putting six 55-gallon drums on it
and filling them with gas and running
a fuel line from the raft to my
motor. Do you think it would work?

JOHNNY
That's very Macgyver of you. But,
no, I don't think it will work. I do
however have the perfect boat for
you. Wait here.

HARVEY
A hundred dollars? For that?

JOHNNY
How much would you pay for it?

HARVEY
I'll give you ten dollars for it. It
actually would make a good planter
for some of my cacti.

Johnny pauses like he's really thinking about this offer.
JOHNNY
No. I can't go that low. It won't
take much to get this back on the
water. I think I'll keep this one
for myself.
Johnny starts rolling the wheelbarrow away.

HARVEY
Okay, twenty-five.

JOHNNY
Thirty-five and it's yours.

HARVEY
I'll take it.

37 A MINUTE LATER 37

Johnny, C.J., Frank, Steve, and Kyle watch as Harvey drives
away with the dingy in the back of his truck.

Johnny hands C.J. thirty-five dollars.

FRANK
That doesn't count. That was in the
dumpster.
JOHNNY
Nobody said which boat.
FRANK
Yeah, but --
C.J.

You're hired.

C.J. and Johnny shake hands.

Johnny, Kyle, Steve, and Frank sit on the deck. A half empty
box of doughnuts sits on the table. Frank eats a maple log.
Johnny reads a boating magazine.

C.J. exits the shop pushing a dolly with a helium tank on it.

C.J.
Let's start blowing up some balloons
and make this place look like we're
having a party.

Johnny gets up, followed by Kyle.

JOHNNY
Aye aye, Captain.

STEVE
I'll be right there. Let me just
finish this cigarette.

FRANK
Let me just hit the head real quick.

Frank exits.

Johnny and Kyle stand blowing up balloons.

JOHNNY
What is their deal? Are they here to
sell or eat free doughnuts?

KYLE
Yeah, they're a little lazy, but they
know how to sell boats.

JOHNNY
Are you kidding? Listen, Kyle, I'm
about to sell more than the three of
you combined. If you want to learn
how to sell, you come talk to me.

KYLE
Yeah, I appreciate that, but I'm only
going to be here for a couple more
weeks. My band is about to be signed.

Frank exits carrying a big sign that says "SUPER GIGANTIC

BLOWOUT SALE." (The word "SUPER" has been added to the old
sign.) He hangs the sign on the fence, crooked, and walks
away.

Johnny walks over to the sign and straightens it.

Johnny and GARY look at a 22' Boston Whaler.

JOHNNY
Do I hear a bit of an accent? Where
are you from?

GARY
Asheville, North Carolina.

JOHNNY
Really, I lived in Asheville. Right
off Tunnel Road by Pete's Diner.

GARY
No kidding. I used to eat there all
the time.

JOHNNY

Yeah, Pete's a great guy. If you're
back in Asheville, tell him I said
hello.

GARY
I'll do that.

Johnny passes the hull of the boat.

JOHNNY
I hate to see it go, but if someone's
going to buy it, I'd really like you
to have it. This was my
grandfather's Whaler. He taught me
how to fish and chase women in this
boat.

GARY
Really, then why are you selling it?

JOHNNY
He just passed away and it's too
emotional when I fish out of it now.

GARY
I'm really sorry about that.

JOHNNY
Thanks. He took great care of this
boat. You're not going to find one
in better condition.

Frank stands beside a ski boat talking to a YOUNG CUSTOMER.

FRANK
It's the Mercruiser 4.3 Liter. The
way the Republicans have screwed up
gas prices, your better off with this
one than the 5.0. It's got plenty of
pep and is a lot better on gas.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT 43
Kyle stands beside a low-profile, high performance boat.

KYLE
This is a pussy-boat. You'll get so
much play in this thing, your dick
will fall off.

The CAMERA PANS OVER to an 80-YEAR-OLD MAN wearing a floppy,
white fishing hat.

80-YEAR-OLD

son, LARRY and LARRY JUNIOR. Steve is smoking a cigarette.

Real good. He's got to check with

Johnny stands beside a Ranger bass boat talking to a
customer, MATT. Frank stands nearby.

JOHNNY
Do you want the hundred and fifty
horsepower motor for an extra five
hundred or the ninety horsepower
motor for the advertised price?

MATT
It doesn't come with this motor?

JOHNNY
Not for that price. We'd lose our
shirts if we did that. The ninety
horsepower is a fine motor. It will
get the job done, but this boat will
scream with that hundred and fifty.

Johnny turns back to Matt.

JOHNNY
Sorry about that, Matt, but it's all

you're saving five hundred dollars,
let's take a look at a bimini top and
some accessories to really cherry it
out.

Johnny enters carrying a stack of paperwork.

JOHNNY
I got full bill on that Ranger and
sold about a grand worth of
accessories.

C.J.
That's great! You're doing a
terrific job. I'd venture to say
that you're almost as good a salesman
as I am.

Johnny smiles and turns to leave, but then turns back to C.J.

JOHNNY
You and I should have a sell-off.
You know, just for fun.

C.J.
I wouldn't want to embarrass you in

Johnny waves to ANOTHER CUSTOMER, who drives away towing a
boat.

Frank, Kyle, and Steve sit on the deck. Steve and Kyle smoke.

KYLE
That guy can really sell, huh?

FRANK
I could sell ten times as many boats
as he does if I were willing to flush
my integrity down the toilet.

STEVE
Yeah, right.

Johnny approaches them. C.J. walks out of the building.

C.J.
Great sales today.

JOHNNY
Thanks, man. Hey, you guys want to
go grab a beer?

FRANK
No, thanks. My daughter has a soccer
game.

C.J.
Man, I wish the other guys had the
passion for selling you and I have.

Johnny greedily bites into the bear claw.

Frank grabs another doughnut.
C.J. enters.

C.J.
I have an announcement to make. As

though he hasn't been here long, he's
really proven himself. I'm not sure
I've done the best job in managing
you guys and motivating you to sell.
With that in mind, I'm going to
promote Johnny to sales manager. You
will all be reporting to him from now

INT. STEVE'S CAR / EXT. MARINA - DOCK - DAY 67
Frank and Steve sit in the car, wearing fishing gear.

STEVE
He had pictures of me and Andrea
having sex. He said if I didn't
sell, he'd show them to my wife.

FRANK
I knew it! He threatened to cut off
Lucy's legs if I didn't sell.

Frank holds up a STUFFED ANIMAL with cotton spilling out of
the hole where it's legs were.

FRANK
He left this as a calling card so I'd
know he was serious.

STEVE
Shit. What are we going to do?

FRANK
We got to go to the cops.

STEVE
And tell them what? That I'm
cheating on my wife, and you think he
tore the legs off Winnie the Pooh to
get you to sell more boats?
They sit in silence for a beat.
FRANK
We need to tell C.J. what's going on.
He'll listen to us.
EXT. BOAT - OCEAN - DAY 68
Catalina Island can be seen in the background. A Grady White
fishing boat drifts along. Steve, Frank, and C.J. all have

Steve starts reeling his rod as it bends down toward the
water.

Suddenly the line goes slack and the pole comes up.

STEVE
Damn!

FRANK
You got too anxious. You have to
play the fish.

STEVE
Thanks "old man and the sea."

C.J.
(laughing)
I really enjoy being out on the water
with you guys. Thanks to Johnny,
we'll be able to do this more often.

A long silence. Steve glances at Frank.

FRANK
C.Jd., we know how much you like
Johnny, but he's a sociopath.

C.J.
What are you talking about?

FRANK
He's cheating customers. He shocked
me with a tazer gun when I didn't get
a customer's phone number. And he
threatened to cut off Lucy's legs if
I don't sell more.

STEVE
Frank's right, the guy is crazy.

C.J.
Now come on guys, you've been
watching too many mob movies. He's
not going to cut off anybody's legs.
Johnny is a little outside the box
with his methods, but he's not going
to hurt you.

FRANK
What about the tazer?

and tell him to tone it down a bit.

Steve sets his pole down to grab a beer from the cooler.

FRANK
I wouldn't leave your pole there.

STEVE
It'll be fine.

As Steve reaches for a beer, his fishing pole jerks taught
and whips over the side of the boat.

Steve reacts, stops. He opens his beer and takes a sip like
nothing happened.
69 EXT. MASON MARINE - DECK - DAY 69

Johnny and Kyle sit on the deck. A customer, QUINCY, comes
onto the lot.

JOHNNY
Get to know him a bit and then start
a negotiation. Ask him if he'd buy
the boat for a dollar. Once he
agrees to that, it's just a matter of
deciding on a price.
Johnny sees Quincy looking at a Wellcraft Bow Rider.

JOHNNY
Go get him, tiger.

Kyle heads out towards Quincy.

C.J. and Johnny blow up balloons.
C.J.
I know this is probably ridiculous,
so don't take this the wrong way.
But did you shock Frank with some
kind of a stun gun?
Johnny pulls out his tazer gun.
JOHNNY
I was just kidding around with him.
It doesn't really hurt. It's made
for training dogs.
C.J.
I think it upsets Frank, so maybe you
better not shock him anymore.

JOHNNY
Yeah, yeah, no problem, Captain.

C.J. hangs the sign on the wall. It reads: "SUPER DUPER
GIGANTIC BLOWOUT SALE."

Frank stands, eating a jelly doughnut. Johnny approaches.

JOHNNY
Did you tell C.J. I tazered you?

RUSTY

Steve starts gathering the items off the shelf.

STEVE
You'll probably want an anchor. It

Steve puts all the things in a pile on the floor and hurries

Funny you should ask. That was my

last month. I was going to keep it,
but there are too many memories
wrapped up in her.

JENNIFER
I'm really sorry to hear that.

JOHNNY
Thank you. The upside for you is
that my grandfather kept this thing
in the garage right next to his fully
restored 1956 Corvette.

Johnny puts his hand on the boat.

JOHNNY
You won't find a cleaner, safer, or
more reliable boat on the lot.
Grandpa would love it if he knew a
nice, young couple got her.

TROY
Do you mind if I get in?

JOHNNY
Help yourself. But do me a favor and
slip your shoes off. Grandpa always
insisted.

Jennifer and Troy take their shoes off. Jennifer smiles as
Troy helps her into the boat.

ANDREW LASER
Why, is your dad a millionaire?

KYLE
No, but if we could present you with
a no lose situation, would you sign
us? If we paid all our own expenses,
did all our own booking and
promotion, you wouldn't have to do a
thing, and we gave you all the
profits, would you sign us?

ANDREW LASER
Sure. Do you guys want to do that?

KYLE
Well, we can't exactly do that. But
let's say we paid half our expenses
and gave you half the profits?

ANDREW LASER
No, I can't do that.

KYLE
Okay, how about we pay sixty percent
of the expenses and we get half the
profits?

ANDREW LASER
Okay, we'll split the profits but you
guys have to pay seventy percent of
your expenses.

KYLE
Deal.

Kyle holds out his hand and they shake.

ANDREW LASER
Welcome to Laser Records.

KYLE

Is there a problem?
C.J.
No.
(to Troy)

Troy, I just wanted to talk to you.
Do we really need lawyers?

Troy MOANS.

WILLIAM
If you have something to say to my
client, you need to say it to me.
Since the assault, my client has lost
his hearing, has limited motor
skills, and has periods of amnesia.

C.J.
Assault? It was an accident. He
fell off the back of the boat.

WILLIAM
Is that why your employee came to the
hospital and threatened to kill my
client and assaulted him with an
electric stun gun?

C.J.
But... it's used for training dogs.

WILLIAM
Great danes, maybe. Do you own your
own house?

C.J.
Yes.

Frank tosses the dirty pants and underwear into Johnny's

No joke. I just wanted to say that

We almost starved out on the road.
That deal I made was crap. I won't
make that mistake again.

FRANK
If you guys really are as good as
Zepplin, you'll get some more chances.

KYLE
Thanks man, I really hope so.

C.J. and Johnny stand on the deck looking at the lot entrance
like a couple of hungry wolves. Suddenly Harvey appears at
the gate. He starts walking towards the deck.

C.J. /JOHNNY

Mine!

JOHNNY
Back off, I said it first. That's my
customer.

C.J.

You're crazy! That was all me.
Harvey has slowed, watching C.J. and Johnny.

Johnny turns and starts walking toward Harvey. C.J. quickly
follows, grabbing Johnny's arm.

Harvey sees Johnny and C.J. coming toward him. He
nonchalantly turns and starts walking back out of the lot.

JOHNNY
(to Harvey)
Hey, Harvey. How's it going?

Johnny sprints after Harvey, followed by C.J.

C.J.
How did you hear about our sale? We
only have one boat left!

JOHNNY
It was my grandfather's boat. He
took really good care of it.

C.J.
Would you buy this boat for a dollar?
HARVEY
I'll come back later. I just needed
an anchor for my automatic toilet
flusher.

C.J.
There won't be any later.

JOHNNY
Harvey, why don't you at least take
a look at our last boat? We're
parctically giving it away. I know
you like bargains.

C.J.
What do you have to lose by looking?

HARVEY
You know, I was thinking about taking
a voyage to Indonesia this summer.
JOHNNY
This is the perfect boat.

145 EXT. MASON MARINE - LOT - LATER 145
C.Jd., Johnny and Harvey stand looking at the Larson.

C.J.
I can get you into this boat for $299
per month.

Johnny steps between C.J. and Harvey.

JOHNNY
Buy it from me and I'll throw ina
lap dance at the Horny Bunny. You
know what I'm talking about.

HARVEY
How much does it weigh? I want
something light so I can add solar
panels to it and still cruise at ten
nautical miles per hour.

JOHNNY
This is one of the lightest boats
ever made. It'll be perfect.

C.J. steps in front of Johnny.

C.J.
The dry weight of this boat is
eighteen hundred pounds. You'll have
no problem adding some solar panels
to it.

HARVEY
Maybe this is the boat for me. I'm
going to need brackets and deep cycle
batteries with at least 540 cranking
amps.

Johnny steps in.
JOHNNY
Harvey, Crazy Johnny is making deals
today. I'll throw them all in for
free.

Johnny holds out his hand to Harvey.

C.J.
He's actually not athorized to give
away free accessories. But I am.

I'll throw them all in free of charge.
HARVEY

What about a GPS with side imaging

technology?

C.J.
Yes. I'll throw that in for free,
too.

Behind them, Johnny picks up a wooden paddle. Frank, Steve
and Mr. Hofferman run off the deck and up next to Johnny.

JOHNNY
I was just kidding around.

Johnny drops the paddle. He looks at his watch.

HARVEY
What about an anchor, bumpers and a
VHF radio?

C.J.
Yes, yes, I'll throw it all in. Do
we have a deal?

Johnny steps in between Harvey and C.J.

JOHNNY
He doesn't even have any VHF radios.

C.J.
I've got a whole case of them inside.

JOHNNY
You better take a look at it. I
think we sold the last one yesterday.
And I don't think he has any GPS's
either.

HARVEY
I want to see the accessories.

C.J. sighs and walks towards the retail space.

armload of accessories. He approaches Harvey.
C.J.
I've got them all right here. So we
have a deal, right?
C.J. holds out his hand to Harvey.

HARVEY
Okay.

JOHNNY (O.S.)
Sorry Captian, I just sold this boat.

The CAMERA PANS over to reveal Johnny standing with Alan.

Johnny holds a handful of cash.

JOHNNY
He paid cash.
(shaking Alan's hand)
You're going to be very happy with
this boat.

C.Jd., Steve, Frank, Kyle, Madeline, and Mr. and Mrs.
Hofferman sit on the deck in silence. C.J. looks like a
boxer whose just gotten pummeled for ten rounds.

Alan drives his truck away towing his new boat. Johnny
approaches the deck.

JOHNNY
Nice try.

MADELINE
It's not six o'clock yet. There's
still five minutes.

JOHNNY
Yeah, but too bad there's no more
boats to sell. I'll take the cash
today and I'll be back on Monday for
the credit card purchases.

C.J. gets up and goes into the retail space.

Tommy and Tyler play with Tuggy the tug boat.

C.J.
Come on, we're getting ready to leave.

C.J. grabs Tommy's hand Tommy hands Tuggy to C.J.

A realization crosses C.J.'s face.

148 EXT. MASON MARINE - DECK - DAY 148

C.J. exits Mason Marine with Tuggy. He sets it down on the
deck, where everyone sits.

C.J.
This is the last boat for sale on the
lot. Maybe ever. This is no
ordinary boat. This has been my
personal boat for the last 37 years
and it's always been stored indoors.
That isn't to say it hasn't gotten
used much. On the contrary, when I
was a kid I took this boat from the
creek in my backyard in Georgia to
ports all over the world.

C.J. (cont'd)

We pulled tankers to safety, rescued
people from boats that were sinking,
saved the girl next door from a big
water monster, and trandsported a
salamander down river to a new home.
This isn't just some boat, this is a
legend.

(picking the boat up

and turning it over)
Considering its age, it only has
minor scratches, no major damage at
all. It is an extremely low
maintenance boat. The buyer of this
boat will recieve a lifetime warranty
bow to stern, free delivery anywhere
in the world, and unlimited free
storage if you're local.
All this for the unbelievable low
price, for the next...

(looking at his watch)

three minutes, of thirteen

thousand dollars.

A long beat. Everyone looks at each other, gets it.

FRANK
I'll take it.

JOHNNY
Yeah, right. Too bad your broke-ass
doesn't have thirteen thousand
dollars.

STEVE
(to Frank)
You want to partner up? I'll kick in
a thousand if you do.

FRANK
Let's do it.

KYLE
I got a '57 Stratocaster that's worth
like two G's.

JOHNNY
No, no, no, that's bullshit. That's
not even a real boat.

MR. HOFFERMAN
Count me in for the rest.

C.J.
Sold!

Oh, man, that's a great sale. Too
bad you only have one minute to come
up with the money.
Mr. Hofferman pulls out his gold card.
MR. HOFFERMAN
Put it all on this. I've got
unlimited credit. I know everyone
else is good for it.
Johnny is furious and starts toward C.J.
JOHNNY
You're going to give me my money or
I'm going to kick your ass.
Everyone on the deck stands up and Johnny stops in his tracks.

MR. HOFFERMAN
I wouldn't come any closer if I were
you.

Johnny hesitates.

JOHNNY
This isn't the end of this.

Johnny turns to leave.

149 AT THE FRONT GATE 149

TINA, the receptionist from Greenville Ford, and two POLICE
OFFICERS enter.

TINA
That's him! That's the no good used
car salesman!
The officers approach Johnny.
POLICEMAN #1
We have a warrant for your arrest for

not paying child support.

JOHNNY
Fuck you.

Johnny tries to walk past Policeman #1 and Policeman #2 steps
in front of him.

POLICEMAN #2
Get on your knees, hands behind your
back, now!

Johnny keeps walking past the cops. Policeman #1 pulls out

the ground.
On the deck, everyone CLAPS and CHEERS. Especially Frank.
INT. MASON MARINE - C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT 150

C.J. enters and sits down at his desk. Madeline enters.

C.J.
After I pay back the consignment
money and settle the lawsuit, I'll be
left with nothing and no inventory to
sell, either.

Madeline pulls out a wad of CASH from her purse.
MADELINE
You forgot about the five thousand he
left.
C.J. stands up and gives her a huge hug.
C.J.
I'm sorry. I really wanted to get
you the bigger house.
MADELINE
I know. And that's what I love about
you. But I've always been happy in
our small house. It just makes us a
closer family.

They share a hug and kiss.

Let me ask you a question. If I were
to offer you this boat for a dollar,
would you buy it today?

MILD MANNERED CUSTOMER
No.

KYLE
What? You wouldn't? For one dollar?

MILD MANNERED CUSTOMER
I'm not sure what I want yet.

Kyle pauses, not sure what to say.
KYLE
How about fifty cents?

No, no, no, you said it was a dollar
