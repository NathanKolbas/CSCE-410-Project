FADE IN:

EXT. LAKE HAVASU - DAY

A garish Jose Cuervo ad flashes by on the side of a bright
yellow HUMMER as it drives through frame, pulling CAMERA into
the mid-summer crush of semi-clad, youthful bodies on main
street Lake Havasu, Arizona.

Havasu is an overcrowded blue collar summer paradise at the
peak of its three-month-a-year run of prosperity. You can
almost smell the sunscreen as heat waves make the crowd on
the pavement appear to waver like a mirage in the desert.
Main street is a row of tourist trap t-shirt shops, bars
coffee shops and cafes. Beyond lies the shimmering expanse
of the lake itself.

CRANE SHOT ENDS as a four wheel drive pick-up pulls into
foreground. A sign on the side of the truck reads “Patterson
Bait and Dive Shop.” A beautiful golden retriever, BAXTER
bounds out of the open truck bed, barking merrily.

TED PATTERSON and JULIE TUPPER step out of the cab. They’re
one of those golden couples who have the ease and confidence
of two people who are perfect for each other. They are
bronzed, athletic, early thirties.

INT. PET STORE - DAY

A bell mounted on the front door JINGLES merrily as Julie
enters with Baxter bounding close at her heels. The
Proprietor, NATE HASKEL, is a pleasant, if forgettable,
middle-aged man, idly surfing the web on his laptop. He
rises as they enter.

NATE
Hi, Ted. Hi, Miss Tupper. Can you
believe this heat?

TED
Pretty miserable, but it’s good for
business.

NATE
(sighs)
Not mine. Tourists usually don’t
bring pets... and they don’t think
much about taking one home. what
can I do for you today?
TED
We need a bag of dry food and a
couple of those rawhide chews.

NATE
You’re a lucky dog, Baxter.

Baxter barks in agreement.

NATE
(gathers goods)
So, the big day’s coming right up,
isn’t it?

Julie and Ted share a warm glance.

JULIE
Only three weeks.

TED
You trying to get me nervous, Nate?

NATE
Well, some of us wouldn’t mind if
you got cold feet. You got the
prettiest girl in Havasu.

JULIE
That’s sweet, Nate.

NATE
That’1l be twenty-two thirty-five.
(as Ted pays)
You know, those Balinese fighting
fish should be in next week.

TED
Great.
JULIE
(skeptical)

Balinese fighting fish?

TED
They’re beautiful, hon. wait ‘til
you see ‘em.

JULIE
Sounds like they’1l eat everything
else in the tank.
NATE
Don’t worry, they come with their
own environment.

TED
I heard the Sumatras are more
aggressive than the Balinese.

NATE
Maybe so, but I wouldn’t recommend
them. They’re much more sensitive
to the PH balance. There’s a
website here somewhere...

Nate punches up the website on laptop.

JULIE
(takes Baxter)
You two chat, I’ve got to get back
to the dock. Your brother’s the
only one minding the store.

TED
That’s trouble.

She gives him a quick kiss.

JULIE
And don’t forget, you’ve got a dive
at one o’clock with that dot com

guy.

TED
(chuckles)
The great white hunter. How could
I forget?

JULIE
Just don’t let him spear you in
that cute tush.

Julie pinches Ted’s jeans-clad butt.

TED
Hey, easy...

JULIE
(waves as she exits)
Thanks, Nate!

NATE
Oh, anytime, Miss Tupper.
JULIE
Julie.
(big smile)
Or Mrs. Patterson.

NATE
Okay, Mrs. Patterson.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE HAVASU - AFTERNOON

An isolated inlet. This is the remote end of Havasu...
breathtaking red rock terrain sculpted by time itself. Not
much has changed here in ten thousand years...

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to reveal Ted standing waist-deep in the
water, wearing a full wet suit and diving gear. MR. CROUSE,
a slightly pudgy yuppie with a tourist’s sunburn waits beside
Ted as he checks his spear gun.

TED
The grouper like to feed in these
inlets this time of day. Remember
it’s all about your approach.

MR. CROUSE
Cool. I’m a human shadow. Lead
the way.

Ted slips on his dive mask, sucks in his mouth piece, and
submerges with barely a ripple. Crouse follows with an
awkward SPLASH.

As they disappear beneath the surface, CAMERA pushes past
them to the nearby shore... where an old TIRE SWING is tied
off to an oak tree. All is silent and still.

Beat.

Then the tire slowly begins to swing. At first, almost
imperceptibly. Then in a widening arc, as if it hada
ghostly rider. The barren branches of the entire tree begin
to TREMBLE.

ROCK FORMATIONS - VARIOUS
The ground begins to SHAKE. Several fist-sized rocks tumble

down the slopes as we hear the growing RUMBLE of an
earthquake.
EXT. THE TOWN OF HAVASU - VARIOUS CUTS

People in the streets react as the tremor hits Havasu. A
pitcher of beer SMASHES to the sidewalk at an outdoor cafe.

INT. PET STORE

Dogs HOWL and parrakeets FLAP in their cages. Nate manages
to catch a fish bowl just as it tips off a counter top.

EXT. LAKE HAVASU - UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

Patterson and Crouse are tossed about beneath the surface in
a churning backwash of water.

The rocky slope at the bottom of the lake SHAKES violently.
Then a jagged crack travels up the slope like an inverse
lightning bolt... and a_twenty foot rift in the floor of the

lake cracks open.

There is a deafening ROAR of water and both men are violently
sucked into the rift... followed by tons of sand and rock.

 

EXT. DOCK - SPEED BOAT - SAME TIME

Julie rises to her feet, screw driver in one greasy hand,
spark plug in the other. JACOB WYATT is assisting her. He’s
a tough-as-nails ex-longshoreman in his sixties.

The boat they’re working on begins BANGING against the dock’s
pylons. Julie grips the gunnels to steady herself.

Then it’s over as suddenly as it started.

INT. PET STORE - SAME TIME

Nate waits a beat, then sets the fish bowl safely back down.
The parrakeets PEEP angrily, but settle back in their cages.
EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

C.U. TED

He struggles to orientate himself in pitch darkness. He’s
alive... but where?
ANOTHER ANGLE

Ted CLICKS on a flashlight and the beam reveals a dark moving
SHADOW whirling straight towards him.

EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME

Julie rises as the boat steadies itself. ZACK PATTERSON,
Ted’s younger brother, bursts out of the dive shop and
crosses to Julie. Zack’s a tattooed twenty-year-old with a
curious charm about him.

ZACK
You okay, Julie?

JULIE
Yeah. Was that an earthquake?

JACOB
(gets back to work)
Hell, that was nothing but a
hiccup. I’ve been in an
earthquake.

MARCUS (20s), Zack’s co-worker, joins them.

MARCUS
Let me guess, that one with Moses,
right? When he parted the red sea.
Wasn’t Pharaoh after you guys?

Jacob is clearly used to Marcus’ dry humor.

JACOB
As a matter of fact, it was the San
Fran quake in ‘89. Little puss
like you would have shit his heart
straight into his tighty whities.

JULIE
Zack, is your brother still out on
that dive?

ZACK
Yeah. Wonder if he felt
anything...

CAMERA PUSHES into a CLOSE UP of Julie as a hint of concern
crosses her features.
JULIE
Try him on the radio, will you?

SMASH CUT TO BLACK

Images briefly FLASH against the darkness, like the flicker
of lightning. A RUMBLE of thunder accompanies each image;

FLASH #1 - EXT. LAKE - TED’S BOAT - SUNSET

Julie frantically inspects Ted’s empty boat, which floats
adrift. Zack and Jacob tie their boat off to Ted’s.

BACK TO BLACK

FLASH #2 - EXT. LAKE - SEARCH BOATS - NIGHT

Two state owned Fish and Game boats ROAR along the shoreline.
A grim-faced SEARCH TEAM scans the darkness with powerful
spot lights.

Julie and Zack ride in the back of the lead boat.

BACK TO BLACK

FLASH #3 - INT. TED’S CABIN - NIGHT

Julie, surrounded by Ted’s family and friends, breaks down in
tears. Zack reacts with anger and frustration, SMASHING his
glass in the fire place.

BACK TO BLACK

TITLES FADE UP - “THREE DAYS LATER”

INT. SHERIFF DOBBS’ OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

A cluttered Fish and Game Department office. SHERIFF JIM

DOBBS, late fifties, is a seasoned enforcement veteran; a

good man whose simply been at this job too long to believe
he’s going to save anybody but himself and his pension.

He sits across the desk from Julie Tupper, who has learned to
believe the same about him.

SHERIFF
We’ve had our resources maxed out
for days now. I can’t justify it
any longer.

JULIE
You’re calling the search off.
SHERIFF
I have no choice. Fourth of July
is the busiest weekend of the year.
Maybe after the holiday...

JULIE
Maybe what?! He could still be
alive out there.

SHERIFF
He certainly could. In fact, I’d
bet money on it. But not in
Havasu, maybe not even in Arizona.

JULIE
What are you talking about?

SHERIFF
Look, I don’t want to upset you
anymore than I have to...

JULIE
It’s a little late for sensitivity.

SHERIFF

Ted Patterson was a better diver
than any man on my search team.
There’s no way he drowned in Lake
Havasu.

(beat)
The truth is, there’s no evidence
that there was any kind of accident
at all.

JULIE
We found his boat adrift!

SHERIFF
Which makes it seem pretty damn
strange that we haven’t found a
body by now.
(pauses)
Your wedding was supposed to be in
two weeks, correct?

JULIE
What are you getting at?

SHERIFF
We have to consider all the
possibilities. One of them is that
Ted simply left town.
JULIE
That’s ridiculous!

SHERIFF
You want to tell me what’s more
likely? Alien abduction?

JULIE
How do you explain the businessman
Ted was diving with...?

SHERIFF
We still have no record of this
“Mr. Crouse.” None of the hotels
had him registered. No one’s
turned up to inquire about him.

JULIE

So, what... you don’t believe me?
SHERIFF

I know this is difficult for you.
JULIE

You’re difficult for me.
SHERIFF

(ice cold)

We’re done for today, Miss Tupper.

JULIE

You were done before you even
started, weren’t you Sheriff?

(rises)
I guess I can’t blame you, this is
such a busy time of year for you.
Must be hard to keep up with all
those fishing licenses.

Julie storms out and slams the door.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Jacob is waiting for her, standing beside the dive shop pick-
He knows the story from the look on her face.

JULIE
(enters passenger’s side)
Don’t ask.
10.

JACOB
They’re just glorified park
rangers, Julie. Even if Dobbs
wanted to help, he couldn’t find
his own ass with two hands and a
flashlight.

Julie slides into the passenger seat, the entire weight of
the tragedy on her shoulders.

JULIE
What do you think happened to him,
Jacob?

JACOB
(shrugs)
Anything can happen in the water.
Anything. I don’t care if it’s six
feet or sixty.

JULIE
(searches for the words)
But Ted was... he was the best.

JACOB
I know. I taught him.

Jacob cranks the engine, reaches under the seat and hands
Julie a coffee thermos.

JULIE
Coffee’s the last thing I need.

JACOB
It ain’t coffee.

As Jacob pulls out, Julie unscrews the cap and sniffs. The
vapors alone makes her eyes water.

JACOB
Go ahead, it won’t make you feel
any worse.
Julie thinks it over... then she takes a deep swig.

WIDER - HAVASU

The pick-up swings out and passes by a traffic jam of
incoming tourists. A large red, white and blue banner is
strung across main street. It reads “Happy Independence Day
From Lake Havasu City Council.”
11.

EXT. DOCK - DIVE SHOP - NEXT DAY

Posters for “Havasu’s Fourth of July Fireworks Extravaganza”
adorn the building. The dock is busy with a variety of
college kids and vacationing families.

INT. DIVE SHOP - DAY

TAYLOR BILLINGS enters the shop like he owns the place. He’s
a trust fund kid with a rocker ponytail, streaked with beauty
salon highlights.

He’s accompanied by REGGIE TRIPP, a frat type with a gym rat
physique, Reggie’s girlfriend, SYDNEY (hot and knows it) and
her college roomies CAMILLE and J.C. Camille talks on her
cell phone as she aimlessly wanders about the shop.

The girls are pretty, but there’s something special about the
quiet one, J.C. Zack notices her right away.

ZACK
Hi. Can I help you guys?

TAYLOR
We want to rent tanks, regulators,
the works.

REGGIE

Light gear. Just for a little
sport diving.

ZACK
Great. Are you certified?

REGGIE
I’m a Navy Seal, man.

ZACK
Really?

REGGIE
Yes, really.

ZACK
Still gotta know if you’re
certified.

REGGIE
(getting irritated)
I’m certified, alright?
12.

ZACK

Then you’ve got a card...?
REGGIE

I got this.

Reggie pulls up his sleeve and flexes. There is an
impressive Navy Seals tattoo on his bicep.

REGGIE
(in Zack’s face)
You can read, right?

SYDNEY
C’mon Reggie. Please don’t start.

ZACK
(to girls)
What about you guys? Ever dive
before?

J.C.
Just some snorkeling. But I’d like
to learn.

REGGIE
I can take care of them. I’m an
instructor too.

ZACK
(sighs)
Right. Look, if they want to dive,
they need to get certified. Takes
about a week. Maybe you should do
it too, y’know. Just to brush up.

Taylor intercedes, pulling out a Gucci money clip loaded with
fifties.

TAYLOR
We’re only in town for a couple of
days. I’1ll pay double. Like a
rush fee.

ZACK
Can’t do that.

Julie enters from the back of the shop, senses trouble right
away .

JULIE
What’s going on, Zack?
13.

ZACK
Gear rentals. I got it. It’s
okay.

Zack sets down a clipboard with a rental form on it.

ZACK
If you really want to dive, I can
take you guys out myself. As long
as I accompany you, one quick
lesson and you’re good to go.

REGGIE
It’s a scam.

JULIE
It’s the law. If you don’t like
it, that’s okay. There’s lots of
other things to do in Havasu.

REGGIE
(eyes Julie)
Why don’t you take us out?

JULIE
Zack’s the best. If you like, we
also do tours on our glass bottom
boat. Stay dry and see some
spectacular underwater life.

REGGIE
That shit’s for tourists.

SYDNEY
Come on, Reggie. Don’t be a dick.
Let’s go on the dive.
Camille finally finishes her phone call.
CAMILLE
Screw this, you guys. We can just
hangout on the houseboat.

J.C. smiles at Zack. Something’s going on between the two of
them.

J.C.
No. Let’s try it. It’d be cool.

Sydney squeezes Reggie’s arm.

SYDNEY
C’mon, baby.
14.

REGGIE
(shrugs)
What the hell...

ZACK
Best time’s early. Like seven a.m.

CAMILLE
Gawd. Are you serious? This is
supposed to be a vacation.

JULIE
He’s right. The lake’1l be calm.
Good visibility. Good dive will
take you ‘til lunch. We supply
sandwiches and sodas.

Taylor lays down his platinum card.

TAYLOR
Can you stock some Coronas?

JULIE
Only for after the dive.
(aside, to Zack)
You sure you want to take these
guys out? They seem like a
handful.

Zack glances up at J.C. and catches her looking at him.

ZACK
It’1l be okay.

JULIE

If they don’t shape up during the
lesson, promise me you’1l1 pull the

plug.
ZACK
You got my word.

EXT. DIVE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

The girls and guys walk to their cars.

CAMILLE
I can’t believe it. You liked that
guy.

J.C.

No way.
15.

CAMILLE
Bullshit. I know you, J.C.

J.C.
Alright, he was cute. So what?

SYDNEY
He’s a loser townie, J.C. And if
you start hanging out with one of
the locals it makes us all look
like sluts.

CAMILLE
Two more weeks and we’re back at
school. You can wait ‘til then to
get revenge on Chad.

J.C.
I don’t want revenge on Chad.

SYDNEY
Of course you do. He dumped you in
front of the entire school.

CAMILLE
Besides, nothing’s better than
revenge sex. That’1ll get Chad
jealous and he’1ll want you back.
Then you get to have great make-up
sex. And after that, you’1l
finally be over Chad, so you can be
the one to dump him. Perfect,
right?

J.C.
Camille... are you still seeing
that therapist?

CAMILLE
No. My mom started dating him, so
it kinda seemed like I was talking
to my dad.

INT. DIVE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Zack watches J.C. through the dive shop window. MARCUS,
Zack’s co-worker, enters lugging a pair of tanks through the

MARCUS
See something you like?
16.

ZACK
I dunno.

MARCUS
They’re Arizona State girls, Zack.
They’re all looking for some
preppie asshole with a Porsche and
a trust fund. That ain’t us.

ZACK
True.

MARCUS
Any word on your brother?

Zack hangs his head.

MARCUS
He’s gonna turn up, Zack. You did
everything you could, so...

ZACK
(cuts him off)
Let’s drop it, okay?

MARCUS
Okay, okay...

Marcus reaches into his back pocket, pulls out a flyer...

MARCUS
Here. Concentrate on this.

It’s for a Fourth of July party.

ZACK
Club Zanzabar?

MARCUS
I made a deal with Rodriguez to use
the Sand Bar. If I turn a profit,
I’1l get to do it every Wednesday
night. I’m a club promoter now,
man.

ZACK
You can call it what you want.
It’s still the Sand Bar. The
place’s got fleas.

MARCUS
I got a D.J. out of Vegas. Guy’s
smokin’ hot.

(MORE)
17.

MARCUS(cont'd)

The place will be packed and not
with those stuck up college
bitches, either.

Zack takes a last glance out the window at the girls. They
climb into Taylor’s big Mercedes and peel out. Looks like
fun and money.

EXT. THE LAKE - SUNSET

The orange rim of the sun dips beneath the horizon line.
The exact moment it’s snuffed out like a candle... nightfall.

The water is calm.
Beat.

A TURBULENCE begins just beneath the dark surface... dozens
and dozens of source points swirl about.

One split second of activity, then the strange phenomenon is
over as if it never happened.

EXT. TRAIL - NIGHT

Two tourists, a teenage boy and girl, ride along on
horseback, passing a joint back and forth.

BOY
Let’s stop for awhile. There’s
supposed to be an old boathouse a
little ways up this trail.

The girl giggles and passes the joint back.

GIRL
Okay, but you have to catch me
first!

The girl kicks her horse in the flanks and it takes off like
a bolt of lightning. The boy wheels around and pursues at a
full gallop.

BOY
Amy!
EXT. SHORELINE - NIGHT
The girl is a hell of a rider. She rides at a full gallop

straight toward the lake, laughing wildly. Youth plus dope
and horse power. Always trouble.
18.

The horse plunges straight into the lake. KER-SPLASH!
Probably feels good on this hot night.

The boy reigns his horse in at the shoreline.

BOY
Amy, get back here!

AMY
Come and get me! wWhat’s wrong,
scared of the water?

She and the horse are now chugging along in deeper water,
following the shoreline. The boy kicks his horse’s flanks
but it spooks at the water line, refuses to go in.

EXT. BOATHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Amy has reached the abandoned boathouse. The dilapidated
pier is half-submerged in the inlet. An old tire swing hangs
from a dead tree. The same tire swing where Ted was sucked
under. Now we know exactly where we are... and it’s nota
good place to be.

Amy can hear the boy calling.

BOY (0.S.)
AAAMMMMYYYY !

She reigns her horse in and pats him on the neck. He stands
in the water, up to his shoulders.

AMY
What do you think? Should we go
back...?

The horse WHINNIES deep in its throat. Something is spooking
him.

Amy follows the horse’s fearful gaze.

AMY’S P.O.V. - THE WATER

The strange DISTURBANCE appears on the moonlit surface.
Dozens, maybe hundreds of churning points of contact. But
this time they move with purpose, traveling directly at Amy.

The entire formation submerges as it races straight at her.

The horse rears up in panic. Amy tries desperately to reign
him in.
19.

AMY
No, Stormy!

ANGLE ON THE BOY

He hears the horses frantic WHINNY and realizes something’s
deeply wrong. He kicks his horse into a gallop along the
rocky shoreline.

BACK TO AMY

Her horse is clambering for a foothold, still up to its
shoulders in the water. Amy is fighting to control him with
all her might.

AMY
No, Stormy, no!

MYSTERY P.O.V.

Eerie SONAR VISION scans the horse beneath the surface as it
struggles to get it’s footing.

The P.O.V. picks up speed, rocketing straight at its intended
target.

ON SHORE - THE BOY

At a full gallop, somehow knowing, fearing just how bad this
could be. He hears Amy SCREAM.

AMY

The water all around her suddenly ERUPTS with blood and
bubbles. The horse BRAYS in agony, thrashing violently
against an unseen enemy.

It collapses into the churning water, taking Amy with it.

THE BOY

Finally gallops up to Amy’s location. He dismounts and
rushes to the edge of the water.

But there’s no sign of the horse or Amy.

SHOCK CUT

The horse breaks the surface, it’s a LIVING NIGHTMARE of raw
flesh stripped down to the bone, yet it’s somehow still

alive; it’s eyes rolled back in agony. Amy is coughing
water, clutching in blind fear to the saddle horn.
20.

CLOSER - AMY

She SCREAMS hysterically as her horse is literally torn to
pieces beneath her... she tumbles with it, straight back down
into the deadly broiling water.

The boy flies out of the darkness on the tire swing... He
grabs Amy around the waist and swings to safety as the horse
finally collapses beneath the surface.

All this has happened without ever revealing a glimpse of the
ungodly force that pulled the horse under.

SHORELINE

The boy and Amy hit the ground hard as they land on the rocky
shoreline. He scrambles to his feet, holding her tightly.

BOY
Amy, are you okay?

She does not reply. By the vacant look on her blood-
splattered face we realize she may never be okay again.

BOY
Amy?! 1!

CUT TO:

EXT. DOCK - MORNING

A beautiful sunlit dawn. Julie detaches the gas line froma
large, expensive looking houseboat. MRS. TUNNIE, a middle
aged woman with oversized accessories (hat, ear rings
sunglasses) steps up to the rail.

MRS. TUNNIE
So sorry to hear about Ted. A
terrible tragedy. But he was a
real sportsman, wasn’t he? So he
liked taking those risks.

JULIE
(pauses)
It’s still kinda tough to talk
about.

MRS. TUNNIE
Oh, I understand.
(beat)
So, you must be starting to think
about moving on by now...
21.

JULIE
What?

MRS. TUNNIE
Well, now that Ted is gone aren’t
you going back to Vegas?

JULIE
I’m not from Las Vegas, Mrs.
Tunnie. I’m from L.A.

MRS. TUNNIE
Really? I heard you were a show
girl or something.

JULIE
I was a realtor.
MRS. TUNNIE
Only danced part time?
JULIE
(gives up)
That’s fifty-six thirty-nine, Mrs.
Tunnie.
MRS. TUNNIE
(pays) .
So you’re going to stay in town
after all?
JULIE

Yes, actually, I am. Ted’s dad
needs me to run the dock.

MRS. TUNNIE
Well, tell him my husband will take
this old dock off his hands
whenever he’s ready to sell.

JULIE
This dock has been in Ted’s family
for years.

MRS. TUNNIE
That may be so, but you’re not.

JULIE
Excuse me?

MRS. TUNNIE
You’re not part of Ted’s family are
you? Not really.

(MORE)
22.

MRS. TUNNIE(cont'd)
And now that Ted’s gone, you won’t
ever be. Joe can’t run things
anymore with his heart condition.
So...

Julie finally starts to get steamed.

JULIE
You know what, Mrs. Tunnie?
There’s only one thing I miss.

MRS. TUNNIE
About what?

JULIE
Dancing in Vegas. I miss shaking
my bare ass for men like your
husband.

MRS. TUNNIE
I knew it! Where there’s smoke,
there’s fire. If you’re smart
you’11 cut your losses and move on
while you can, missy!
(calls to captain)
We’re done here, Jose.

As the houseboat slowly pulls out, Zack steps up beside
Julie.

ZACK
You really danced in Vegas?
JULIE
Nope. Think I ought to give it a

try?
(Zack grins)
Don’t answer that.

Julie secures the gas line. Jacob steps up and takes over
for her.

JACOB
Let me grab that for you, kid.

JULIE
Thanks, Jacob.

JACOB
Don’t let that old gas bag get to
you. Her and her old man have been
trying to get their hands on this
pier for twenty years now.
23.

JULIE
Well, they’1l have to wait another
twenty as far as I’m concerned.

JACOB
That’s my girl.

ZACK
I’ve got to take out that charter.
You need anything?

JULIE
I’m fine. Just keep it simple with
those kids, okay?

She tosses Zack the boat keys.

ZACK
No worries.

EXT. LAKE - MORNING

The Patterson’s excursion boat, the “Chill Pill” cuts across
the calm waters of Havasu with Marcus at the helm. Taylor,
Reggie and the girls are lounging on the open deck as Zack
helps them prep for the dive.

Zack helps J.C. slip on her tank. He adjusts the harness.

ZACK
Too tight?

J.C.
No, it’s fine. I didn’t think air
could be this heavy.

ZACK

Once you’re in the water, you won’t
even know it’s there.

J.C.
Hold on a sec.

She adjusts a neoprene knee brace.

ZACK
Bad knee?

J.C.
Just gotta take care of it. I tore
some cartilage swimming.
24.

ZACK
What kind of swimming?

J.C.
I compete for Arizona State. I’1ll
be fine as long as I don’t push it.

ZACK
As far as I’m concerned, the whole
point of diving is not pushing it.
It’s about going with the flow. I
think you’re gonna love it.

J.C.
Why do you?

ZACK
What?

J.C.

Love it so much. I can see it in
your face when you talk about it.

ZACK
(adjusts her harness)

I dunno. It’s kind of like flying.
No, it’s more like... a dream of
flying. You’re weightless, gliding
through this secret world where all
you can hear is your own breathing.
And no one else can see what you
see.

J.C.
You must dive alone a lot.

ZACK
...guess I do.

Reggie interrupts, dropping his tank down with a loud CLANG!

REGGIE
Hey man, this regulator’s fucked
up.

ZACK
Should be okay. I checked it this
morning.

Reggie strains to turn the valve.
25.

REGGIE
Well, you didn’t check this. I
can’t work with this cheap crap.

ZACK
Lemme see.

Zack turns the valve in the opposite direction Reggie’s been
turning it. We instantly hear the HISS of air coming through
the line.

REGGIE
This is different than the gear we
train with.

ZACK
Sure. The Seals probably use
valves that twist in the wrong
direction to like, foil terrorists,
right?

Reggie fumes. Marcus cuts the engines and trips the anchor
release.

MARCUS
(over intercom)
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
captain speaking. Please stow your
tray tables in their upright
position. We have arrived.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The boat drifts to a stop, revealing a picturesque hidden
cove. Red rock walls tower above placid water.

Zack slips overboard into waist-deep water.

ZACK
Okay. wWe’ll stop for a quick
lesson and still have plenty of
dive time before lunch.

SYDNEY
(admires view)
»..not bad.

TAYLOR
Cabo’s nicer.

CAMILLE
This sucks. Can we try someplace
else?
26.

J.C.
(slips into the water)
C’mon, Cami, it’s beautiful. The
water’s perfect.

CAMILLE
(displays phone)

No reception.
TAYLOR

You just might have to talk to us

in person without A.T. & T.

involved.

Zack plunks the gear down on shore. J.C. notices something.

J.C.
Look at that...

ANGLE ON SHORELINE

J.C. hops up into the old tire swing. Now we know they’ve
dropped anchor right were Ted Patterson disappeared.

J.C. begins to swing. The old rope CREAKS under her weight.

ZACK

Hey! Don’t do that!
J.C.

Why not?
ZACK

That thing’s like twenty, thirty
years old. I don’t want you to
fall on your... um.

J.C.
My ass?

Taylor wades up onto shore.

TAYLOR
And a fine ass it is.
(to Zack)
Calm down there, Aqua Boy. You
don’t want to pop a stiffy in your
speedo.

27.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Havasu doesn’t have the crystal clear waters of the
Caribbean, but it does have its own unique beauty. The
“atmosphere” of the water carries breathtaking shafts of
light that ripple across the perfect bodies of J.C. and her
girlfriends as they gracefully descend.

MONTAGE :
Zack puts the college kids through some of the basics;

Flooding their face masks, then learning how to blow them
clear without surfacing.

“Buddy Breathing,” in which two divers alternate off of one
tank. Reggie breaks rank to play grabass with Sydney.

Zack and J.C. glide weightlessly along the incline of the
rocky slope. J.C. spreads her arms like wings to “fly” for
Zack.

Taylor gets Zack’s attention, showing him that his regulator
is reading in the red (low air time). Zack scribbles ona
hand-sized MARKER BOARD. It reads: “Relax. You're
Hyperventilating.”

ANGLE J.C.

She’s noticed something peculiar a short distance ahead. We
immediately recognize the RIFT, the deep crevice that
swallowed Ted Patterson alive.

CLOSER - RIFT

The sand along the rim is slowly, but constantly trickling
inward, disappearing into the dark void within. It’sa
subtle but weird phenomenon.

J.C. glides over for a closer look

ANGLE ON ZACK

As he turns, realizing he’s lost sight of J.C... then he
spots her.

THE RIFT
J.C. swims down towards the rift, gracefully passing through

a shaft of rippling light. The second she’s over the open
crevice, she’s violently sucked down into it.
28.

ZACK REACTS

He drops his hand board and swims with all his might, blazing
straight to J.C.

THE RIFT

J.C. desperately clutches a rocky outcropping as the undertow
drags her inside. Nothing but a slippery hand hold keeps her
from being swallowed up by the darkness.

INT. RIFT - SONAR P.O.V.

An eerie SONAR image of J.C., as she’s seen by something from
inside the rift. She appears as a softly strobing
silhouette, constantly scanned and rescanned by radiating
sonar waves. A small figure in a vast black limbo.

The P.O.V. rushes straight up at the struggling J.C.

ANGLE ON THE RIFT

J.C.’s hand slips and she’s jerked inside. But she snags a
second hand hold.

Frantic, she looks back over her shoulder, into the darkness.
Her dive mask is RIPPED from her face by the relentless
current. She slips a few more inches, now blinded.

SONAR P.O.V.

Rushing straight at J.C.’s feet

C.U. - J.C.’S HAND

White knuckled grip. She hangs on... but the rock gives way.
CA-RUNCH!

J.C. disappears into the darkness. But Zack’s hand thrusts
into the rift and grabs her forearm.

ZACK

He straddles the rift, fighting tons of water pressure. He
pulls all his might... and J.C. slowly begins to appear, inch
by inch.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Zack manages to get J.C. past the outer edge of the crevice.

The grip of the relentless undertow is suddenly broken and
Zack and J.C. sling shot away.
29.

Zack takes J.C.’s hand and quickly leads her to the surface.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOCK - DIVE SHOP - AFTERNOON

Julie sips a cup of coffee as she leans against the weathered
railing, gazing out at the sparkling reflections of the late
afternoon light on the water.

As she watches, Julie notices an odd turbulence on the lake’s
surface. It’s distant, but still noticeable.

Julie slips on her UV sunglasses.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

The image is cleaner. There is definitely something odd
about the disturbance on the surface.

WIDER

Julie walks a few feet down the dock and grabs a pair of
binoculars from a tackle box. She scans the water, but is
now past the safety railing, perched on the edge of the dock.

JULIE’S P.0.V. - BINOCULARS

A water skier, a young girl, is heading toward the patch of
turbulence.

LOW ANGLE - WATER

A tracking shot from in the water as Julie watches.

Something is watching her. There is a growing sense of dread
about what lies in wait for Julie.

Julie GASPS as the ski girl crosses the odd patch of water
and WIPES OUT, disappearing in a spray of water.

C.U. - JULIE’S FEET

Julie, engrossed in the view through her binoculars, steps
dangerously close to the edge of the dock.

BINOCULAR - P.O.V.

The girl does not surface for one, two, three seconds... her
empty skis pop up.

ANOTHER ANGLE
30.

Julie slips, losing her balance.
A HAND

Shoots out of nowhere, grabbing Julie’s forearm... pulling
her back to safety.

WIDER

It’s Nate, the pet store owner. Julie recovers, still upset
by what she’s seen.

JULIE
Nate... you startled me.
NATE
(awkward)
Oh, sorry! I, uh... you almost

fell in.

Julie glances back at the scene. The ski girl finally
surfaces, laughing. Her friends in the boat pick her up.
All is perfectly normal.

NATE
I just thought I better stop by and
service the aquarium. I figure
since Ted’s... well, since he’s not
around, I...

JULIE
(pulls herself together)
That’s sweet of you, Nate. C’mon
in.

INT. DIVE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
Nate and Julie enter.

NATE
I’m really very sorry about Ted.

JULIE
I haven’t given up. I won’t until
I know what happened to him.

NATE
You’11 find him. TI know you will.
If there’s anything I can do...
anything. Just let me know.
31.

JULIE
Of course, Nate.

Nate is left in a totally awkward state.

NATE
I’ll... just, you know, check the
PH. The angel fish, they’re
tricky.

JULIE
Thank you...

NATE
Okay, then.

Nate finally turns and hurries off to the safer world of his
fish.

EXT. PATTERSON DOCK - DAY

The Looking Glass pulls into its sloop. Jacob greats them
and expertly ties off the tow lines.

JACOB
How was the dive?

TAYLOR
(hops off)
Great, except for the part where
your instructor almost got my
friend killed.

Marcus guides it into its slip at the Patterson dock. Zack
helps J.C. step off the boat. She’s still badly shaken from
the misadventure.

ZACK
There’s an emergency ward five
minutes from here, I can...

J.C.
I told you, Zack. I’m okay.

ZACK
Just to make sure.

J.C.
This is already embarrassing
enough... really, I’m fine.
32.

TAYLOR
You’re the one who’s got problems,
aqua-boy. My dad specializes in
injury law. wWe’re going to own
that boat, this dock and every dime
you make for the rest of your
natural life.

SYDNEY
Taylor, try not to think about
money for five minutes, okay?

Reggie confronts Zack as he off-loads the tanks.
REGGIE

So that was your “sweet dive spot?”
Fuckin’ idiot.

ZACK
Back off man.

REGGIE
Next time we go out, I run the
dive.

ZACK

Before you get somebody hurt, maybe
your friends here oughta know the
closest you’ve ever been to the
Seals is at Marine World.

REGGIE
You don’t know shit.

ZACK
Really? Better tell the guy who
did your tat that the “e” in Seals
comes before the “a.”

Reggie stops in his tracks and checks the tattoo on his
bicep. A shocked look crosses his face.

REGGIE
What?! That stupid shit! Are you
serious?
ZACK
(ice cold)
The tattoo’s fine; but you’re no
Seal.
(beat)

My brother was a Seal. You
couldn’t shine his shoes.
33.

Zack walks off towards the dive shop, leaving Reggie
completely flustered. The girls begin to giggle.

TAYLOR
(laughs)
Oh, man, you are so busted.

REGGIE
(calls after Zack)
You’re dead meat, trailer trash!

CUT TO:

INT. DIVE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Zack and Marcus stow the dive gear as they discuss the
incident with Julie.

JULIE
Sounds like you got caught in some
kind of suck hole. When I was a
kid we had to watch out for them
along the California coast

MARCUS

But this is a lake, not the ocean.
(to Zack)

Are you even sure what you saw down
there?

ZACK
The girl almost got killed, okay
Marcus?

MARCUS

How do you know that? If the
undertow was that strong it
couldn’t be constant. Unless it’s
just “the black hole that eternally
sucks.”

(pauses)
No, wait... that’s my life.

JULIE
(pauses)
You think you could find it again?

ZACK
(shrugs)
It was hard to see when I was right
on top of it. I could try.
34.

MARCUS
What’s the point? Just stay away
from it.

JULIE

The point is... if it happened to
you, it could have happened to Ted.

A chill goes through every person in the room, as they
realize that Julie is right.

ZACK
(softly)
Even if it did, he would have never
survived this long...

JULIE
I know that.
(beat)
If he is down there, I can’t just
leave him. We’ve got to bring him
home.

Zack begins to choke up.

ZACK
Yeah... you’re right.
NATE
There could be air.
ZACK
What?
NATE

You never saw this rift before that
little tremor on Thursday, right?

ZACK
Right. Which is very weird because
we dive there all the time.

NATE
If there’s a strong current, it may
be that something large opened up.

JULIE
If it is one of these lakes... is
it possible that it could have an
air pocket?

NATE
Oh, I don’t know about that...
35.

Phone RINGS.

MARCUS
Nate, there’s a call for you.

NATE
No one knows I’m here.

MARCUS
It’s your mother. She says the
Sheriff’s Department is looking for
you.

NATE
(panics)
What?! Tell her... tell her I’m
not here. Tell her...

ZACK
You in trouble, Nate?

NATE
No. Not that I know of...

MARCUS
(hands him the phone)
Go ahead. Don’t worry, I can hook
you up with a good lawyer.

NATE

(into phone)
Hello, ma?

CUT TO:

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN from the upper deck of the houseboat, where
the girls are greased up, catching some rays. Someone’s mp3
player is plugged into a boom box. Reggae/Rap BLARES.

CAMERA ENDFRAMES on the rail of the lower deck. Reggie sits
on a lounge chair, puffing on a Cuban cigar.

Taylor appears and sets some cold Coronas in the tub of ice
beside Reggie.

He sits in a lounge beside Reggie.

TAYLOR
We need to talk.
36.

REGGIE
Sure... about what?

TAYLOR
The girls.

REGGIE

They’re hot, right?

TAYLOR
Yeah. But I thought you said
they’d want to party.

REGGIE
They do. You just gotta get them
in the mood.

TAYLOR
The mood is about a grand a day of
my money. Which is starting to get
irritating. Tell them if I was
looking for new buddies, I’d have
joined a softball team.

REGGIE
C’mon, man. These are sorority
girls. You don’t want to freak
them out.

TAYLOR
Yeah, I know. But if this keeps
up, I’m going to have to have a
funeral for my dick.

REGGIE
Which one do you like?
TAYLOR
J.C.
REGGIE

You make her nervous. Camille is
more your type. Concentrate on
Camille.

TAYLOR
No, J.C. Lets figure out how to
make her un-nervous.

Reggie reaches into his pocket and pulls out a slip of
paper... the Club Zanzibar hand out.
37.

REGGIE
Here, check this out.

TAYLOR
What is it?

REGGIE
A very hot Fourth of July party
tomorrow night. Supposed to get
seriously wild. If that doesn’t
loosen the girls up, I’ve got
something special that’1l chill
J.C. out for you.

TAYLOR
For real?

Reggie reaches into his backpack and tosses Taylor a small
aspirin tin.

REGGIE
For emergency use only. Two in her
margarita and she’s yours.

TAYLOR
Is it safe?

REGGIE
(shrugs)
You're not taking ‘em, bro. She
is.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - DAY

The Deputy Sheriff steers the Fish and Game Department’s
boat. Sheriff Dobbs stands beside Dale, scanning the
coastline of this rugged end of the lake. Nate sits idly
behind them.

SHERIFF
I’m not sure I understand this
son. How do you lose an entire
horse?

DALE
I don’t know. Something just
dragged it down.
(softly)
I didn’t know a horse could scream.
38.

NATE
Technically, they do. If you know
what to listen for, they also laugh
and cry. In fact, a number of
mammals do, including dolphins and
elephants.

SHERIFF
Spare us the Discovery Channel
B.S., Nate. We’re just trying to
piece together what happened here.
You’re the only horse expert we
got.

NATE
I supply feed for the dude ranch
but... actually, my specialty is
tropical fish.

SHERIFF
(irritated)
Fine. Do you happen to have an
opinion about what this boy has
been telling us?

NATE
Well... It’s awfully shallow here
for a healthy horse to drown.
Might have broken a leg and
spooked.

DALE
That’s not what happened.

DEPUTY
There’s the boathouse.

The Deputy slows the engines. The boathouse is clearly
abandoned, it’s dilapidated pier half-submerged in the water.
The familiar TIRE SWING is prominent on the shoreline.

DALE
It was in here somewhere.

NATE
What’s that?

The Sheriff follows Nate’s gaze. Only rocks and seaweed are
visible beneath the boat.

SHERIFF
What?
39.

NATE
I’m not sure. Circle around...

The Deputy swings the boat in a tight 360. This time he cuts
the engines and they drift along in silence. Nate scans the
lake bed.

NATE
Right there...

He leans out over the side of the boat to get a better look.

SONAR P.O.V.

From below... scanning Nate as he leans out. The sun behind
Nate flares, obliterating the image.

ANOTHER ANGLE - NATE

Half hidden in the shallows, a piece of metal GLINTS in the
sunlight... a stirrup.

NATE
Right there.

Nate slips over the side into waist-deep water. The terrain
beneath the water is rough. The rotted wood of the old
boathouse’s dilapidated pier makes it tricky.
SHERIFF
(to Deputy)
For Christ’s sake, Jerry. Give him
a hand.

The Deputy slips off his t-shirt and tosses it in the boat...
submerges in the shallow water.

UNDERWATER - SIMULTANEOUS

The Deputy grabs the stirrup and pulls. Whatever the strap
is attached to, it’s firmly hooked up under wooden debris.

SURFACE
The Deputy comes up for air, gasping.

DEPUTY
It’s hung up on something.

Nate wades over beside the Deputy.
40.

EXT. UNDERWATER - SONAR P.O.V.

In eerie, softly glowing SONAR VISION, The Deputy reaches
right into CAMERA to get a grip on the stirrup.

Whatever is watching The Deputy, it’s so close that it’s
strange he doesn’t see it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Deputy and Nate strain against the stubborn stirrup...
suddenly, with the CRUNCH of wood, a large SHADOWY MASS
breaks free.

SURFACE

Nate tumbles backwards into a section of rotted wood. It
crumbles on impact. CRUNCH-SPLASH!

CLOSER

The HORSE’S GRISLY BONES burst to the surface in a cluster
around Nate... he scrambles to free himself, tangled up in an
old net that has snagged the remains.

The Deputy helps Nate out of the tangle of rancid bones and
netting. The Sheriff observes from the side of the boat.

DEPUTY
You alright?

NATE
Fine! I’m fine.

The Deputy heaves the saddle up into the boat and the men
climb back on board. The Sheriff grabs a small camera from
his gear and snaps a picture of the bones.

SHERIFF
How long ago did you say this
happened?

DALE
Last night.

SHERIFF
Looks more like last week. Those
bones have been stripped clean.

The shredded SADDLE looks as if it’s been through a wood
chipper.
41.

SHERIFF
What the hell could have done this?

NATE
I have no idea...

The Sheriff gets a shot of the saddle as the Deputy inspects
the straps, ripped into ribbons of leather. Water pours out
of the torn saddle bag...

SHOCK CUT

A DARK SHAPE explodes out of the saddle bag... right at
Dale’s throat. Jaws SNAP! Dale SCREAMS as arterial blood
sprays out in a gruesome arc.

The Deputy grabs the dark, glistening CREATURE and yanks it
off Dale’s blood-splattered neck. It’s tail whiplashes as it
flies overboard and disappears beneath the surface.

Dale scrambles away, gripping his throat, but the blood still
squirts out with each heartbeat

The Sheriff grabs a towel and presses it to the open hole.

SHERIFF
Sit back! You’ve got to lie still.

The Sheriff applies direct pressure to the shocking wound.

SHERIFF
(to Deputy)
Get us out of here.

The Deputy guns the engines.

SHERIFF
(to Nate)
You want to tell me what the hell
that was?

NATE
I didn’t get a very good look, I...

SHERIFF
You said you were a fish expert.
Find out. And find out soon.

Nate sits... and notices the Sheriff’s digital camera lying
beside him.
42.

The image of the waterlogged saddle is frozen on the view
screen. A dark BLUR has been captured on the lower right
edge of the shot... the creature leaping from the saddle bag.

Nate takes the camera and punches the screen controls
ZOOMING IN on the image.

Although it’s dark and distorted, the creature’s gruesome
profile is visible. Rows of horrid fangs and a white,
glaring eye are visible within the ghastly blur.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE SAND BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Marcus pulls up in front of the Sand Bar in his 70’s Shelby
Cobra. It would be a classic, but it’s more bondo than
Cobra.

As Marcus exits the car, he notices an orange state-
sanctioned PICKUP parked near the bar’s retaining wall.

Two men, STATE GEOLOGISTS, are checking the pylons that
support the bar’s outdoor deck that hangs over the water.

Marcus is immediately concerned. He tries to look casual as
he saunters over to the pair.

MARCUS
Hey, guys. What’s going on?

GEOLOGIST #1
Are you the owner?

MARCUS
(lies)
I’m his partner.

GEOLOGIST #1
Wwe’ve been spot-checking some of
the public buildings since that

quake.

MARCUS
Wasn’t much of a quake, though, was
it?

GEOLOGIST #1
Three point eight. But the numbers
can be misleading. Looks like you
have some baseline damage on your
pylons.
43.

MARCUS
Really? You sure about that?

GEOLOGIST #2
The damage might not be structural.
We’1l have county engineers out
here sometime next week to do a
more thorough assessment. In the
meantime, you’d best keep people
off that deck.

The Geologist fills out a form and hands it to Marcus.

GEOLOGIST #2
Call us if you have any questions.

MARCUS
I get it. Better to be safe than
sorry.

GEOLOGIST #1
Exactly. You have a good holiday.

MARCUS
You too, sir. Thanks.

Marcus watches as the Geologists return to their truck. He
waves at them as they pull out onto the main road.

As soon as they’re out of sight, Marcus balls up the notice
and tosses it in a trash can.

MARCUS
And you can kiss my sweet Irish
cheeks until Sunday morning.

He stuffs it in his pocket and slaps on of his club flyers on
the door in it’s place; “Club Zanzabar - Party Down on the
Fourth.”

CUT TO:

C.U. - TED PATTERSON - DAY

He’s standing in the rear of a speedboat. This is PLAYBACK
of a digital tape. Julie is operating the digital cam, so we
can hear her voice, but she’s not in the shot. She’s in the
midst of a playful “interview” with Ted.

JULIE (V.0. - TV)
So, Mr. Patterson, as a famous deep
sea diver...
44.

TED
Lake diver. That’s a lake behind
me.

JULIE (V.0. - TV)
Okay, whatever. “Deep lake diver,”
to what do you attribute your great
success?

TED
I owe it all to the little people.
Specifically the little five-foot-
two girl in the red bikini right
here.
(grabs off cam at Julie)
Now suit up.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Julie, curled up on her couch
with Baxter watching the playback on her TV.

JULIE (V.0. - TV)
I told you I don’t do scuba. You
guys dive, I’11 make lunch.

TED
What are you scared of?

JULIE (V.0. - TV)
Everything. I’11 be so slow,
you’11 end up leaving me behind.

TED
(suddenly serious)
Listen, I will never, ever leave
you alone down there, understand?
Now go get your gear on...

Ted playfully SNAPS his towel somewhere below the frameline.
The camera goes cock-eyed as Julie shrieks with LAUGHTER.
EXT. JULIE’S CABIN - LAKEFRONT - NIGHT

The sounds of the playback of Julie’s laughter ECHOES across
the moonlit lake. The swirling TURBULENCE briefly appears on
the surface of the water, a larger more defined arrowhead of
motion... then all is still again.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

The houseboat is docked for the night at a remote pier.
Laughter and music can be heard from inside.
45.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

J.C. is painting her toenails. Camille is chatting on her
cell phone. Reggie and Sydney begin necking shamelessly on
the couch. Taylor enters with a pitcher of margaritas
puffing on a joint.

TAYLOR
Hey, we gave you two the master so
we wouldn’t have to watch the
miracle of creation.

REGGIE
(mumble)
Fuck off...
CAMILLE

(into cell phone)
Jackie? I’m losing you...

Camille rises, trying to find a “sweet spot” for reception.
Taylor pours J.C. a margarita and offers her a puff of the
joint.
J.C.
No thanks.

Taylor picks up her nail polish bottle and takes a whiff.
TAYLOR
No wonder. You already copped a
buzz off of this shit.
Camille mimes her irritation.
CAMILLE
(into phone)
Sorry, I can’t hear you. People
are talking in here.
TAYLOR
That’s our primary form of
communication on this planet. I/’1l
phone you sometime and explain it

Camille exits in disgust.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Camille steps out onto the pier, searching for reception.
46.

Three drunk FRAT BOYS are lounging on a speedboat docked in
the next slip. They try to get Camille to join them as she
passes by, but she won’t have anything to do with them. She
remains focused on her cell phone, panning it like she’s
searching for gold with a metal detector.

ANOTHER ANGLE PIER
Camille slips off the pier into warm waist-deep water.
E.C.U. - CELL PHONE SCREEN

Camille sees the phone’s reception bars multiply from zero to
three...

CAMILLE
(softly)
Yesss...

She wades further out.
UNDERWATER P.O.V. - SAME TIME

In eerie, undulating SONAR VISION, we see Camille's lower
torso wade out into deeper water. The P.O.V. is distant, but
approaching fast.

CAMILLE

She’s still casting about for reception... slows to a stop.

UNDERWATER P.O.V.

As Camille stops walking, her sonar image disappears like a
ghost. Whatever this “vision” is, it only works on moving
targets.

 

WIDER - PIER

One of the frat boys has followed Camille to the edge of the
dock. He watches her, admiring her body... but then notices
something strange.

The TURBULENCE flickers across the surface of the water,
heading straight for her

FRAT BOY
whey.

Camille is still preoccupied, trying to get a call out. She
remains standing in place, punching her send button.
47.

FRAT BOY
(louder )
Hey!

Camille finally looks up, irritated at the interruption.

FRAT BOY
(softly, intensely)
Don’t move.

Camille recognizes the fear in his voice. Something is
wrong. Very wrong.

She glances down at the water.
VERTIGO CRANE SHOT

C.U. of Camille as she looks down in horror all around her.
CAMERA rapidly BOOMS UP until it’s directly overhead,
revealing an IMMENSE SHADOW circling Camille beneath the
surface. It could be the Loch Ness Monster... or hundreds of
Piranha.

 

Whatever it is, it completely encircles her.

UNDERWATER - PIRANHA P.O.V.

SONAR VISION is receiving scattershot images; a section of
the uneven lake bottom, a bit of Camille’s calf, a section of
the pier’s pylons. As long as she holds still, the target is
unclear.

E.C.U. - CAMILLE’S CELL PHONE

The L.E.D. display lights up with a message; INCOMING CALL.
Beat. The phone RINGS LOUDLY.

HIGH ANGLE

The SHADOW RING of piranha instantly responds to the RING and
attacks Camille! The water EXPLODES all around her as she’s
jerked beneath the surface.

C.U. - THE FRAT BOY

Watches in stunned disbelief.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HOUSEBOAT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

J.C. is nearly asleep on a fold out bed when Sydney enters.
She looks exhausted and is carrying a pillow and a blanket.

SYDNEY
Reggie snores like a fucking lion.
Mind if I crash on the couch?

J.C.
No. Go ahead. Is Camille back
yet?
SYDNEY
(shrugs)

Not that I know of. She must have
finally made her love connection.

J.C.
Her what?

SYDNEY
Look, I love Camille. But she’s
the queen of booty calls. why do
you think she’s always on the
phone? The girl’s quicker on
delivery than Domino's.

J.C.
You sure she’s okay?

SYDNEY
You’1l see. She’1l probably show
up at the party tomorrow with some
hot guy. Maybe two.

J.C.
Maybe three.

SYDNEY
Great. Then I can finally ditch
Reggie. I think all those steroids
are starting to take the lead out
of his pencil.

The girls giggle and high five. J.C. clicks off the light.
49.

EXT. PATTERSON DOCK - DAWN

JACOB assists Julie and Zack as they load diving gear into
the glass bottom boat, preparing to search for the rift.
Baxter the dog is excitedly running up and down the dock.

VOICE (0.S.)
Ahoy, there!

Julie turns. Nate marches out onto the dock, wearing a bad
boating hat and carrying an overstuffed beach tote. Baxter
BARKS a joyful greeting and dances around Nate as he
approaches.

JULIE
Oh no, Zack. You didn’t.
ZACK
Not me. He invited himself.
NATE
(calls out)
Morning!
JULIE
(half-hearted)
Hi, Nate.

Nate holds up his duffel, stuffed full.

NATE
Brought my gear. I just thought
you could use some help.

JULIE
It’s sweet of you to offer, but we
have no idea if we’ll find
anything.

NATE
(softly)
He was a good man. I just...
(awkward)
Well, I’d like to help, if I can...

JULIE
(considers)
Of course, Nate. Climb aboard.

Jacob grabs his duffel, helps him board.
50.

ZACK
So how was your big meeting with
the Sheriff?

NATE
Very strange indeed. He needed my
advice.

ZACK

Is he interested in fish?

NATE
He is now. But I’m not so sure I
can help him.

JULIE
Alright, grab a seat, everybody.

Baxter leaps on board just in time as Julie pulls the boat
out of it’s slip.

CUT TO:

EXT. COVE - THE LOOKING GLASS - DAY

KER-SLASH! Zack drops the anchor overboard. They’ve reached
the remote cove. Julie passes out compact high-beam
flashlights.

JULIE
You put in the fresh batteries?

ZACK
Yeah.
(tests his light)
This’1l be like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

JACOB
Try this...

Jacob tosses Zack an UNDERWATER FLARE from a cardboard box.

JACOB
That’s a hell of a lot brighter
than your flashlight; but they’re
only good for about fifteen
minutes. Just crack the cap... and
keep it away from your face.
51.

Zack casually inspects his flare, but does a double-take as
Nate steps up from the aft of the boat.

Nate has donned a surprisingly flashy red and yellow wetsuit
with a large NO FEAR logo down the arm.

NATE
(off Zack’s reaction)
What? It was a gift.
Jacob hands Nate a flare. Nate handles it gingerly.

ZACK
Something wrong?

NATE
Sorry. It’s just that I’m a little
claustrophobic, so if we do finda
cavern...

JULIE

(takes back the flare)

That’s okay. We don’t expect you
to go in.

NATE
But I’ve got your back.

ZACK
Good to know.
EXT. UNDERWATER - MOMENTS LATER

One by one Julie, Zack and Jacob plunge into the water and
begin their descent.

DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE - SEARCH FOR THE RIFT

They methodically cover the lake bed... gliding over sand and
rock as they seek the rift.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SAND BAR - OUTDOOR DECK - LATE AFTERNOON

Marcus is busy making preparations for his party. A
waitress, a bus boy and CARRIE the bartender, are helping
out.
52.

CARRIE is a tough, buff biker chick in her late twenties
everybody’s favorite bartender.

CARRIE
What kind of crowd are we
expecting?

MARCUS
The kind with cash... and plenty of
it, I hope.

RODRIGUEZ, the owner, steps out onto the deck.

RODRIGUEZ

Hey, Marcus, we got a problem.
MARCUS

What?
RODRIGUEZ

Your D.J.’s people are here.

MARCUS
So what’s the problem?

RODRIGUEZ
They want to know where to put
their gear.

We now hear the WHINING of heavy machinery and two roadies
appear on a FORK LIFT PLATFORM as it rises into frame.

A huge stack of amps and a set of SPOTLIGHTS are lifted to
deck level. In the B.G., two vans and a large generator
truck have just begun to unload.

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN from Marcus’ stunned reaction... down past
the structure of the deck... to the PYLONS that support it
above the water.

A small chip of plaster falls off the hairline FRACTURE of
the center pylon.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON

Baxter is poised at the bow of the boat... ears perked as he
patiently waits for his mistress. The sun is dangerously low
on the horizon.
53.

EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

Julie, Zack and Jacob continue their search, gliding across
the lake bottom.

ANGLE ON THE RIFT

Zack and Jacob glide down and settle beside the rift. Jacob
raises a hand, cautioning Julie back

He digs his hand into the lake bottom and releases a handful
of sand over the rift. It plumes out, then is suddenly
sucked inside by the powerful undertow. The current is on.
Julie nods, she understands.

Jacob checks the rock formation for a solid spot, then
unslings a rock hammer from his dive belt and pounds a STEEL
PITON into the bedrock.

Zack does the same.

They clip nylon lines to the pitons and secure them to their
dive belts.

Jacob shows Nate how to tend to the coils of line. Nate
gives an exaggerated thumbs up.

Julie CRACKS off the end of her flare, which ignites its
magnesium core. A bright blue incandescent LIGHT illuminates
their surroundings. She looks to Jacob. He CRACKS his
flare, moving in right behind her.

Julie pushes out over the rift, holding the flare before
her... In an instant she is swept inside by the powerful
current. Her nylon line quickly plays out.

INT. RIFT

Julie tumbles inside, ripped head over heels by the powerful
backwash. She slowly regains control and drifts to a stop.

CLOSER - JULIE

She gazes up in awe at the vista before her, illuminated by
the ghostly flicker of her flare.

Zack shoots into the cavern right behind her. Jacob’s last
54.

JULIE’S P.O.V. - UNDERGROUND LAKE

The vast ceiling of the underwater cavern is breathtaking, a
Sistine Chapel of ancient rock arcing out into darkness.

This place may have existed undisturbed for centuries.

Julie glances back at Zack and Jacob, who are equally in awe.
All are humbled by the sheer size of this place.

There are several HOLLOWS in the cavern walls, which may or
may not be passages. Julie and Zack glide forward, pausing
at each hollow to briefly illuminate its interior with their
flares... searching for any sign of Ted Patterson.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Julie, Zack and Jacob pass by, SWARMS OF PIRANHA are
revealed, watching from the shadows within the hollows. They
hover just beyond the ring of light from the flares.

The ghostly forms rise and fall with an eerie grace, staying
just out of sight as our heroes slowly swim past.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - THE LOOKING GLASS - SAME TIME

Baxter stands poised at the bow of the boat, waiting
patiently for his master.

NATE
Don’t worry, boy. They’re okay.

Nate sits in the bow with his laptop open and scrolling
through a site titled “National Oceanographic Society” The
program is in the midst of a search titled “Fresh Water Fish -
Characteristics.”

On the lower quadrant of the screen is a scan of the
Sheriff’s photo of the mystery fish.

 

Nate carefully overlays the blurred image with green
reference points that detail the fish’s facial
characteristics. A glowing grid connects the dots.

Nate presses a button and the program begins to rapidly
search hundreds of images from the site... seeking a match.

CUT TO:
55.

INT. CAVERN

Zack, Jacob and Julie swim along with their flickering
torches held before them. The cavern has narrowed down to a
winding tunnel filled with rocky arches and dark hollows.

Jacob motions to Julie, showing her that their lifelines are
nearly played out.

As Julie checks her line, the light from her flare falls ona
a beautiful little SEAHORSE, unlike anything she’s seen
before.

It GLOWS with a soft phosphorescence and its entire body is
translucent. Its fluttering heart and organs all look as if
they’re made of glass.

It circles around them, its delicate fins whirring like
humming bird wings. It’s followed by another half-dozen of
its kind, all glowing like something out of a fairy tale.

As Julie watches, the seahorses skim across the sandy floor
passing over something metallic in the sand... something man
made.

Julie starts towards it, but is pulled up short as her nylon
cord goes taut. They’ve reached the end of their lifelines.

She glances back at Zack, then makes a decision. Julie
unclips her line and continues forward.

Zack is obviously concerned. He looks back
JACOB’S P.O.V.

Their lines trail off into the dark murky void. Zack
reluctantly unclips his line and follows Julie.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CAVERN FLOOR

Julie dusts the sand away from Ted’s cracked DIVE MASK. She
glances at Zack. Whatever Ted Patterson’s fate was, they’re
getting closer to finding out.

A ripple runs through the swarms of piranhas in their
positions throughout the hollows. The natives are restless,
but they still avoid the radiant nimbus of light that
encircles the divers.

CUT TO:
56.

EXT. LAKE - LOOKING GLASS - SUNSET

Baxter begins to WHINE, pacing up and down along the side of
the boat. Nate is getting nervous as well.

NATE
Don’t worry boy, they’1l be back
soon.

Nate now hears a soft BEEP TONE from his computer, glances
back at the screen...

NATE
(softly)
Damn...

ANGLE ON THE SCREEN

The program flashes NO MATCH. A question appears on the
screen; “Alternate Search.” Nate checks the box marked
“scale twelve inches” to “any scale.” The search instantly
flashes to a MATCH.

The gruesome profile of a BRAZILIAN FRESHWATER PIRANHA fills
the screen. It’s a close match to the photo... only our fish
is twice the size and three times as nasty looking.

NATE
(whispers)
Sweet Jesus with a tambourine...

Nate clicks “more” and is hit with dozens and dozens of
images... each more gruesome than the next of the vicious
species. The tiny, evil eyes, disproportionately large
fangs, the distinctive underbite. An mpeg suddenly appears
and begins to playback a jittery black and white film clip;

CLOSE - COMPUTER SCREEN

In the crude image, an ox is led by Brazilian ranch hands
into a swiftly flowing river. As it steps into the water, a
time code appears in the corner, counting the seconds.

At first, nothing happens. Then the ox suddenly collapses
into the water.

The water around the oxen now churns violently. It’s head
breaks the surface, braying in pain.

The moment the time code hits twenty-seven seconds it
FREEZES. Ox bones bob up to the surface, picked clean of
flesh.
57.

C.U. - NATE
He’s thunderstruck as he realizes;
FLASHBACK
Nate tangled in the horse’s bones.
WIDER
Nate rises, nervously pacing back and forth. Baxter BARKS,
picking up on Nate’s indecision and fear. Nate glances at
the extra oxygen tanks. The box of flares. He knows he
should warn Julie.
Baxter BARKS.
NATE

I can’t! I told them, I can’t go

in there. They’1ll just have to...
Nate’s voice trails off. He’s stuck between a rock and a
hard place of sheer terror... and the sun is setting.

INT. CAVERN

Zack’s flickering torch reveals a blocked passage. Dead end.
He turns back to Jacob and Julie... now what?

At that moment, Zack’s torch begins to SPUTTER.

Zack fumbles for the flashlight clipped to his belt, just as
a_swarm of PIRANHA rises up from the hollows behind him.

Dozens of sightless eyes reflect the dying light as they rise
up out of the darkness. Zack’s flare finally goes out.

Julie grabs Zack’s arm, pulling him back. The swarm surges
forward in a swirling mass!

Julie holds her flare higher, briefly driving them back, but
then her flare begins to sputter

Icy fear grips Julie as she realizes their situation. She
turns back, looking for any other escape route.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

By the last cold-blue flicker of Julie’s light, the cavern
walls appear to move. Hundreds of piranha line the walls.
They rustle like leaves in the wind, their metallic scales
GLISTENING. Julie, Zack and Jacob are completely surrounded.
58.

Then Julie’s flare sputters out. The entire cavern is
plunged into PITCH BLACK.

Zack’s FLASHLIGHT BEAM finally flashes ON, stabbing through
the darkness... It’s too damn narrow and too dim, but it
reveals our worst fears;

SHOCK CUT

A cloud of piranhas, swirl around them, closing in for the
kill. They tear into the closest target... Jacob.

Zack watches in horror as Jacob is ripped to pieces before
his eyes... still alive and SCREAMING as the gleaming white
bones of his rib cage are stripped bare.

The fish go berserk, tails lashing and fangs snapping.
Jacob’s blood billows out in a dark cloud as his limbs are
ripped from his torso. The power and speed of their attack
is absolutely terrifying.

CAVERN

Zack discovers his light beam has the effect of a Star Wars
“light saber.” It repels the fish as it strikes them.

But Zack is fighting a losing battle as the swarm grows
around them... becoming more aggressive with every heartbeat.

Julie’s light beam FLASHES on, as Jacob spins about in panic,
caught up in a living twister of piranhas. His blood stirs
the piranhas into a greater frenzy.

Julie tries to help, but is quickly forced to fend off her
own attackers. She flashes her light in their eyes to turn
them away.

Zack turns and the beam reveals a huge SWELL of piranha
surging straight towards him.

Zack backpedals in the darkness and collides with a cavern
wall. His flashlight is knocked from his grasp and tumbles
into the darkness below. Zack immediately swims straight
down... trying to catch it

Julie swims for her life in a blind panic, deeper into the
cavern. The swarm splits; half whirls about to pursue Julie,
half dive bombs after Zack.
59.

INT. DROP SHAFT - SAME TIME

Zack swims straight down into this natural well of icy
water... and the swarm swoops down right after him.

Zack’s flashlight tumbles down through the darkness, its beam
bouncing off the craggy walls.

Zack is in a deadly race... straight to the bottom of this
natural well, with the swarm right behind him.

INT. CAVERN - BOTTLE NECK

Julie swims for her life. The pitch black cavern has now
narrowed into a winding tunnel. Julie’s legs are scraped by
the razor sharp walls, leaving a trail of blood behind her

Piranha swarm into the tunnel from both directions. Teeth
and eyes FLASH up out of pitch blackness, cutting off her
escape.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the last second, Julie ducks into a narrow hollow in the
cavern wall.

The two swarms COLLIDE into one another, just missing Julie.
The fish attack each other in their killing frenzy, quickly
filling the tunnel with dark blood and bits of flesh.

INT. NARROW PASSAGE - JULIE

Julie swims for all she’s worth, heading straight up a narrow
“stove pipe” passage. It grows narrower as it twists and
turns... growing more and more claustrophobic.

Julie now hears the eerie SOUND of the swarm approaching, the
leathery SNAP of tails accompanied by an almost subliminal
banshee WAIL.

Julie twists about, scraping the narrow walls as she checks
behind her with her flashlight.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

Hundreds of piranha streak straight up, completely filling
the narrow “stove pipe” passage.
60.

JULIE

Turns back... and bumps straight into a GRISLY CORPSE. Half
a body blocks her path, a grinning skull beneath a dive mask.

She instinctively flinches backwards, but the sound of the
piranha grows LOUDER and LOUDER.

Julie grabs the corpse. Could this be Ted? There’s no time
to think. The corpse pulls free, falling to pieces and Julie

swims straight through it!
REVERSE

The piranha race straight up through the narrow funnel of
rock.

JULIE

Pure adrenaline empowers her. She desperately swims/scrambles
up the jagged walls.

JULIE’S TANK

SLAMS into solid rock. She’s caught! The passage is simply
too tight to make it through.

She SLAMS into the ring of solid rock again and again, but
she’s stuck like a cork in a bottle.

THE SWARM

A living wall of teeth rockets up the rocky chute and tears
into the flesh of Julie’s legs!

JULIE

She SCREAMS, losing her mouthpiece. The pain is
excruciating. She panics, gulping water, only seconds left
to live.

QUICK CUTS

Julie releases her harness. She pulls free of her tank...
swims straight up with no oxygen.

THE PIRANHA

In their frenzy, they attack the oxygen tank. We hear the
metallic SCREECH as teeth scrape on metal.
61.

JULIE

No choices left, swims up... up... going on thin hope. Long
odds. Trailing blood. Lungs about to burst.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

Rising up over jagged rocks... the beam of her flashlight
catches something strange in the darkness dead ahead.

Her own reflection swims straight at her. Julie breaks the
surface!
INT. CAVERN - AIR SPACE

Julie sucks in a lungfull of centuries-dank air... and
immediately begins coughing.

She has surfaced in an AIR POCKET somewhere within the

cavern. The beam of her flashlight quickly reveals the
truth:

She has surfaced in a dead end... a_rocky cove the size of a
coffin. She flashes her light back downwards.

BELOW

Her tank is solidly wedged in the narrow bottleneck. The
swarm’s access is blocked for the time being.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAND BAR - DECK - DUSK

The place is packed, inside the bar and out, standing room
only. Rap/Rock blares.

Marcus is a nervous wreck. He sucks down a shot of tequila
and SPANKS the bar.

MARCUS
Carrie, hit me!

CARRIE
Don’t tempt me. This is a mob
scene, Marcus! I should have three
back-ups working this bar.
62.

MARCUS
That’s why I’m lucky to have a pro
like you.

CARRIE
Nice try.

(tosses him a bar towel)
Get back here and give me a hand.

MARCUS
What?! !

CARRIE
You heard me, get to work or I’m
walking. Now, Marcus.

MARCUS
Okay, okay.

Rodriguez elbows his way to the bar.

RODRIGUEZ
The Sheriff’s office just called.
We have to clear some of these
people or they’1l shut us down.

MARCUS
Just stall ‘em. Fireworks will
start any minute. Some of them
will leave.

We now see a PATRON turn away from the bar, loaded down with
margaritas... it’s Taylor. He makes his way through the
crowd.
ANGLE ON A TALL BAR TABLE
Taylor delivers the drinks to J.C., Sydney and Reggie.

J.C.

Where’s Camille? I thought you
said she’d meet us here.

SYDNEY
Don’t worry, She can take care of
herself.

REGGIE

This is a rip-off. I thought there
was supposed to be fireworks.
63.

SYDNEY
The fireworks are right here, sweet
thang.

Taylor slides in beside J.C. The rowdy crowd pushes in on
them from all sides.

TAYLOR
This place is a zoo. I knowa
great little restaurant that serves
killer barbecue. Maybe we should
slip out for awhile.

J.C.
(re: Reggie and Syd)
They look pretty happy here.

TAYLOR
No, I mean just you and me.

ANGLE ON THE STAGE

Basically a wall of giant speakers and a high tech set of
turntables. A local D.J. grabs the mic.

D.J.
And now... from the stone cold
heart of Las Vegas, where paradise
is a pair of dice. We bring you
Lil John and the Too Live Crew.

ANGLE ON THE GIRLS

J.C. and Sydney watch as the hard core rap crew takes the
stage.

Taylor takes advantage of the distraction... He drops the
small white PILL from Reggie’s aspirin tin into J.C.’s drink.

ANGLE ON THE STAGE

LIL’ JOHN, a hard core rapper, his bare chest covered with
jailhouse tats, takes the mic as his D.J. starts spinning the
turntables.

The stack of base woofers BOOM like cannons as Lil’ John
begins his rap. The crowd moves to the beat.

ANGLE ON PYLONS - WATER LINE
64.

That fracture in the central pylon is no longer “hairline.”
More plaster flakes off as the combination of the dancing and
the monster subwoofers VIBRATES the entire deck.

CUT TO:

INT. CAVERN - AIR SPACE

Julie is clinging to the rocks, trying to slow her breathing.
Stay calm to survive. She hears a disturbance in the water
beneath her.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

A Single piranha is squirming through the narrow space
between her tank and the passageway.

Julie desperately tries to climb higher, but it’s impossible
on the slippery moss covered rocks. Trapped.

The piranha shoots straight up and breaks the surface like a
leaping trout. Julie throws herself to one side.

It’s teeth SNAP as it just misses her. The piranha impacts
the side of the cavern and careens back into the water.

Julie begins to hyperventilate, trying desperately to locate
the piranha with her flashlight. It could be coming at her
from any direction.

Her flashlight beam reveals two more wriggling through. The
tank SCREECHES against the rocks as it becomes dislodged.

The tank drops away into the darkness, and the entire swarm
surges straight up at Julie.

We now hear the most surprising thing of all... a voice.
Barely a WHISPER.

VOICE
This way...

Her beam flashes upward, revealing a hidden shelf on the
opposite wall of the narrow air space.

Julie snags a slippery hand hold and scrambles up as a dozen
piranhas leap up at her heels.

HIGH ANGLE

The rabid piranha fly into the air, SNAPPING at Julie as she
rolls into the safety of the hidden shelf.
65.

ANGLE ON SHELF

Ted Patterson lies wedged in the tiny alcove just a few feet
from Julie. He looks frighteningly thin and weak, but he’s
alive!

JULIE
Ted! Oh my god, Ted...

Tears well up in Julie’s eyes.

From this closer angle, we can see how tough it is for him to
muster the energy to speak.

TED
(weak whisper)
Julie. How did you...?

JULIE
Are you alright?

TED
(coughs)
I’ve been better...

Julie notices his hands are dark with blood and curled into
tight fists.

JULIE
Your hands...
TED
I was... I was trying to dig...

stupid.

The flesh of Ted’s fingers are scraped down to the bone. The
rock ceiling above him is covered with bloody claw marks.

JULIE
Can you move?

TED
I don’t know. I busted some ribs.
Can’t feel my legs.

Ted begins coughing again... sounds worse this time. Julie
cups some water in her hands and brings it to his lips.

JULIE
Here. Try to drink.

Ted sucks the cool water through blistered lips.
66.

JULIE
We’ve got to get out of here.

The fish can be heard SPLASHING just below them.

TED
Those fucking things... they’re
waiting for us.

Julie’s voice shakes with emotion; the entire experience is
catching up with Julie.

JULIE
(softly)
They killed Jacob right in front of
me. Tore him to pieces. I tried
to help him, but I couldn’t, I...

TED
That’s enough.
(pauses)
We’ve got to think. Did you see
any other way out of here?

JULIE
(shakes her head)
Nothing, as far as I can tell. One
way in, one way out.

TED

Is anyone else with you?
JULIE

Zack, Nate... we got seperated.
TED

They’11 never find you in here.
You’ve got to get back to the
entrance.

JULIE
(corrects him)
We have to get back to the
entrance. I’m not going without
you.

CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

Baxter WHINES, pacing back and forth along the length of the
boat.
67.

CLOSER - SUN

The last rays of sun dip below the horizon.

INT. CAVERN - AIR SPACE

Julie pauses as she hears a DISTURBANCE in the water. She
trains her light on the pool beneath them.

THE PIRANHA

Still circling... but one by one they dive downward,
returning to the main cavern.

JULIE
What’s happening?

TED
Nightfall. The swarm leaves the
cave as soon as the sun sets.
(beat)
This is your chance, Julie...
you’ve got to take it.

EXT. SAND BAR DECK - NIGHT

It’s a few margaritas later and Sydney is busy arguing with
Reggie about his “lack of commitment.” Taylor leans close to
J.C. as she finishes her drink.

TAYLOR
You ready to go?

J.C.
No, I...

J.C.’s head bobs as she begins to nod off.

J.C.
Wow... that was strong. Was that a
double?

Sydney suddenly jumps up from her seat

SYDNEY
Hey you guys, look! The fireworks
are starting.

Everybody looks up as an impressive display of multi-colored
fireworks CRACKLES in the early evening sky. The D.J. cranks
up the music. The crowd rises to their feet.
68.

J.C. stumbles as she tries to rise. Taylor swoops right in,
slinging an arm around her.

J.C.
(softly)
I don’t feel so good...

TAYLOR
I’ve got you, just relax.

J.C. swoons. With her head leaning on Taylor’s shoulder
they look just like a normal young couple in love.

Taylor glances back at Sydney. She’s still watching the
fireworks with Reggie. Taylor pulls J.C. closer.

TAYLOR
C’mon. You need some fresh air

He rushes her off through the crowd.

INT. CAVERN - NIGHT
Ted’s growing weaker... can barely speak

TED
You’ve got to hurry. Go on. Take
my tank. There’s still air in it

JULIE
We’re going together.

TED
I’1l just slow you down.

JULIE
Remember when you told me you'd
never leave me alone down here?

TED
(smiles weakly)
.. yeah.
JULIE

That works both ways.

Julie braces herself against the rocks and carefully drags
Ted into the water beside her.

CLOSER
69.

Julie fumbles for his oxygen bit and secures it in his mouth.
She still has no tank of her own. Ted’s too far gone to
argue.

Julie hyperventilates with quick short breaths to fill her
lungs to capacity, then takes one last long GASP and dives
straight down, clutching Ted closely to her side.

CUT TO:

INT. CAVERN

Julie swims straight down with all her might. She’s forced
to go through the bottleneck first, then pull Ted after her.
Her lungs already aching.

THE CAVERN

Julie exits the hollow and peels out into the main cavern,
navigating by the narrow beam of her flashlight. Still no
fish in sight.

She makes a beeline for the exit... but hits a rocky wall.
CLOSER JULIE

As she realizes she’s taken a wrong turn. She desperately
flashes her beam around the unfamiliar rock formations.

EXT. UNDERWATER - RIFT ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT

Nate finds the rift and swims straight for it... but pulls
back at the last second.

CLOSER - NATE

His eyes grow wide and he begins to rapidly hyperventilate.
We can see that his claustrophobia is suddenly overwhelming
him.

NATE’S P.O.V. - THE RIFT

A classic Spielberg PUSH IN/ZOOM OUT, vertigo of the narrow

rift. Only a fool would go in that narrow, nightmarish
passage.
70.

INT. CAVERN - SAME TIME
Julie turns, panic stricken, completely disoriented in the

vast black limbo of the cavern. She gives up her last gasp
of oxygen... but still won’t take the bit from Ted.

She’s suddenly jerked back... a hand grasps her shoulder

It’s Zack, holding her nylon line. Zack takes out his oxygen
bit and offers it to Julie. She takes a desperately needed
gulp of air.

Julie “buddy breathes” with Zack as he helps her pull Ted
towards the cavern exit.

SHOCK CUT

A pack of piranhas swirl up out of the darkness directly
behind them.

Julie and Zack make a break for the entrance, dragging Ted
with them. The passageway is only twenty yards ahead...

The piranhas wheel about and head straight for their
victims... picking up speed.

Julie, Zack and Ted are going to reach the entrance at
exactly the same time as the swarm.

ANGLE ON THE PASSAGEWAY

Nate shoots inside, thrusting a BLAZING FLARE before him.
Instantly, the pack scatters from the blinding light

But Nate panics, dropping the flare. He’s pushed himself
beyond his limits and can barely move.

Zack pushes Nate back out the rocky passageway as Julie pulls
Ted along with her.

EXT. LAKE - MOMENTS LATER

Baxter BARKS excitedly as oxygen bubbles break the surface.

Nate appears, then Zack and Julie, supporting Ted. They
cling to the boat’s aluminum ladder.

ZACK.
Ted... is he alive?!

Julie spits out the mouthpiece, gasping.
71.

JULIE
He’s hypothermic. We’ve got to get
him to St. Edwards!

NATE
(climbing up)
What happened to Jacob?

JULIE
He’s gone.

CUT TO:

INT. CAVERN - SAME TIME

Nate’s fallen flare sputters out, leaving the passageway in
darkness again. The swarm quickly regroups.

CLOSER - THE SWARM

The swarm’s point man, THE ALPHA FISH, is a large, battle
scarred male with a broken fang. He surges forward, leading
them through the passageway.

The entire swarm fans out behind him as they head into the
lake in a search and destroy mode.

Alpha Fish reacts as he hears a low, rhythmic THRUM.

ALPHA FISH P.O.V.

This THRUM can actually be seen by Alpha Fish... it appears
as a deep, wide RIPPLE in the otherwise even sonar plane of
the lake bed.

ANGLE ON ALPHA FISH

He swims upward toward the sound, leading the entire swarm
towards the surface.

EXT. LAKE HAVASU - SURFACE

CAMERA races along the surface of the lake as the now
familiar TURBULENCE appears, the eerie swirling phenomenon
that is the sign of the piranha. The shadowy swarm skims
along just beneath the surface of the moonlit water.

CAMERA BOOMS UP to reveal their destination. The party

lights of the Sand Bar’s outdoor deck lie directly in the
path of the swarm.
72.

The rhythmic THRUM becomes loud and clear... it’s the bass
line of Lil’ John’s rap performance as the Fourth of July
party heats up.
CUT TO:
EXT. SAND BAR DECK - THE D.J./RAPPERS - NIGHT
Lil’ John is on the mic, working the crowd.
LIL’ JOHN
(chants)
Jump on it! Jump on it! Jump on
it!

The crowd HOOTS and HOLLERS, jumping in unison to the beat.

EXT. SAND BAR - BENEATH THE DECK

The pylon finally CRACKS wide open. The underside of the
deck SHAKES. Dust trickles down.

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to the surface of the water.

The pale eyes of the approaching swarm of piranhas are
visible, glowing through the dark surface of the water like a
parade of ghosts.

EXT. DECK - BEHIND THE BAR

Carrie is still trying to serve a sea of customers. Marcus
does his best to back her up.

Carrie pauses, sensing something...

CARRIE

Hey... Did you feel that?
MARCUS

What?
CARRIE

I dunno. For a sec I thought it
was another earth quake.

CUT TO:
73.

EXT. LAKE - THE LOOKING GLASS - NIGHT

The boat flies across the moonlit water with Zack at the
wheel. He’s speaking on the boat’s shortwave radio. Julie
sits with Ted, a blanket pulled tightly around his shoulders.

ZACK
(hangs up)
There’1l be an ambulance waiting
for us at the dock.

Julie glances at Ted, who nods weakly.

JULIE
He’s going to make it.

NATE
How did you two survive in there?

ZACK
They couldn’t stand the light. It
was the one thing that backed them
off.

NATE
(pauses... thinking)
Light sensitivity only occurs in
cave fish, or fish that have
evolved in the deepest parts of the
ocean. Most of them are nearly
blind in the sunlight.

ZACK
...that’s why the attacks only
happen at night.

JULIE
But how could creatures like that
turn up in Havasu?

NATE
That wasn’t just a cavern, it was
an underground lake.

ZACK
A what?

NATE
A large body of water completely
cut off from the outside world.
Maybe for centuries.

(MORE)
74.

NATE(cont 'd)

They’re not uncommon, especially
here in Arizona.

JULIE
If that’s true, something had to
pen it up.

oO

TED
(softly)
The quake...

They all turn to Ted. He’s fully conscious, but his voice is
still weak.

TED
he lake bed collapsed... we were
uried alive.

oo

NATE

 

It would take an environment that
was closed off for centuries, for
that kind of creature to evolve.
JULIE
What kind of creature Nate? What
are they?
NATE
(pauses)
Piranhas.
ZACK

They’re much larger than piranhas.

NATE

But they have all the other
attributes. The predatorial fangs,
the swarm mentality...

(beat)
If they did evolve in isolation,
they could be the progenitors of
the entire species.

CUT TO:

EXT. PIER - NIGHT

A secluded spot a short distance from the Sand Bar
Spotlights from the party can be seen in the B.G. Occasional
FIREWORKS continue.
75.

Taylor’s Mercedes pulls down an incline to a stand of weeping
willows at the end of the pier. The engine and the
headlights click off.

CLOSER - MERCEDES

Taylor leans over to J.C. She is slumped in the passenger
seat, fading in and out of consciousness.

Taylor cautiously runs a hand along her bare arm... caressing
her. A test to see if she’1l wake up.

J.C. moans softly and stirs. Taylor gets more daring with
his caress. Leans closer.

TAYLOR
(whispers)
Feels good, doesn’t it? You’re so
beautiful...

The delusional bastard thinks she’s enjoying this!

He reaches across and lowers her seat back. It drops down
with a CLUNK.

J.C. stirs, her eyes half open. Is she going to wake up?
Taylor slides across the console and lays on top of J.C.

TAYLOR
(whispers)
I know what you want...

Taylor nudges her legs apart and kisses her neck. He fumbles
with the snap of her jeans.

J.C.’s eyes flash open. She wakes up, completely
disoriented.

J.C.
What are you...? Taylor!!!

But Taylor is committed to getting what he wants.

TAYLOR
Hey, don’t be a little tease...

Taylor continues to grope her, getting forceful. J.C. fights
back, raking his face with her nails.
76.

EXT. PIER

Three COLLEGE BOYS, jock types, are sharing a joint as they
watch the fireworks. They react to J.C’s SCREAM.

JOCK #1
(rises)
What the hell was that?
INT. CAR
J.C. kicks and punches Taylor with all her might.

TAYLOR
You bitch!

Taylor is such a punk, he starts to hit her back. He doesn’t
notice as he BUMPS the gear shift... putting the car in
neutral.

EXT. CAR

As they struggle, the big Mercedes slowly rolls down a brief
incline... and out onto the short pier

ANGLE ON COLLEGE JOCKS

They see the car rolling straight towards the edge of the
pier.

JOCKS
Hey!... Hey! Look out!
THE MERCEDES
The car is slowly losing momentum... the front wheels go off
the edge.
INT. CAR

J.C. and Taylor both react to the double BUMP as the front
wheels drop. There is a SCREECH of metal on wood as their
world tips over towards the water.

EXT. PIER

The Mercedes seesaws, then plunges off the edge of the pier
with a huge SPLASH!
77.

EXT. UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

The Alpha Fish turns abruptly at the sound of the splash.
The vast formation behind him follows.

EXT. LAKE

The Mercedes bobs back up and drifts out into the lake.

INT. CAR

Taylor finally realizes what’s happened. The water line is
already halfway up the windows and rising.

TAYLOR
My car! You stupid bitch!
EXT. UNDERWATER

The swarm is on the move, wheeling about, swirling towards
the sinking Mercedes.

SHORE

The Jocks splash into the water. The car is only a few yards
further than the pier.

JOCK #1
(to Jock #3)
Get some help.
As Jock #3 hurries off, Jocks #1 and #2 wade straight out
towards the car.
INT. MERCEDES

The car is quickly sinking; the waterline continues its
steady rise up the windows.

TAYLOR
Shit... my Dad’s gonna kill me.

J.C. tries the door, but it’s held shut by the external
pressure of the water. Her attempts grow more frantic.
78.

TAYLOR
Hey, chill out, okay? The water’s
not that deep. The pressure will
equalize in a couple of minutes.

J.C. notices that rushing water is quickly filling up the car
through the air vents.

The two Jocks appear, up to their chests in the water. J.C.
can see them above the split waterline as the car continues
to sink.

JOCK #1
Hey! You okay in there?

TAYLOR
Fuck off! We’re fine.

As J.C. watches, a strange SURFACE TURBULENCE rushes at the
Jocks from behind. A swirling SHADOW darkens her view below
the surface.

The foremost Jock is struck by an invisible force so hard
he’s spun around... but he’s still standing, a surprised look
on his face.

The Jock raises his arms above the waterline... revealing
bare, splintered bones sticking up from two bloody stumps!

The water now EXPLODES into churning hell and both Jocks are
pulled under.

TAYLOR
(gasps) .
What the hell’s happening?

The waterline continues to rise as the Mercedes sinks... only
inches of air space visible along the top of the windows.

The interior water is three feet deep and rising.
ANGLE ON WINDOWS

The murky water surrounding the car is now washed by a DEEP
RED... reducing visibility from bad to zero.

J.C. can no longer see anything through the bloody red water
It is deathly quiet until...

CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!
Multiple piranha hit the glass, their deadly teeth mashed

against the window, SNAPPING inches from J.C.’s face. She
SCREAMS.
79.

CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! Dozens more swim into the
glass, literally covering every inch of surface... CAMERA
REVOLVES around J.C., a terrifying 360 degree view of the
nightmarish attack.

At the same moment, the interior is rapidly flooding,
reaching the dash. Hundreds of SNAPPING mouths fight for
position at the windows. J.C. screams.

TAYLOR
Shut up!!! I’m trying to think
Taylor stabs at a button on the dash... the sun roof! It’s

still just above the surface of the water, but it doesn’t
open.

Taylor cranks the keys in the ignition. The interior lights
BLINK ON, then instantly short out.

TAYLOR
Shit!!!!

He stabs the button again... And the sun roof smoothly WHIRRS
open, revealing fireworks in the starlit sky.

TAYLOR
(smiles)
Yes! German craftsmanship...

Taylor scrambles up out of the sun roof. J.C. hurries after
him.

EXT. LAKE - SAME TIME

Taylor and J.C. pull themselves up onto the roof of the
sinking mercedes. The water around them churns with piranhas

as the grisly bones of Jocks #1 and #2 bob up to the surface.

The shadow of the swarm is immense, swirling around the car
on all sides.

J.C.
What are they?!

TAYLOR
Seriously pissed off fish...

They balance on the roof as the slippery blood-darkened water
inches up on them.

Taylor pulls open the blade of a pearl-handled penknife.
Looks crazy, but it’s his only defense.
80.

J.C. gazes at the churning water, scared out of her senses.
A light appears out on the darkness of the lake. It’s the

Looking Glass!
J.C.
A boat!
(calls to boat)
Hey, over here!
ANGLE ON THE LOOKING GLASS
Zack is at the helm. He’s still far away, but he spots them.

ANGLE ON TAYLOR AND J.C.

The water washes over their feet... floods down through the
sun roof.
TAYLOR
Shit!!!  They’re not going to get

here in time.

The car slowly starts to tilt, rolling over in the water.
J.C. and Taylor balance as best they can.

J.C.
You think we can swim fast enough?

Taylor gets a crazy look in his eyes. He suddenly grabs
J.C.’s wrist and cuts deeply across her forearm with the
penknife. Blood wells up.
TAYLOR

Now I only have to swim faster than

you.
He shoves J.C. into the water
ANGLE ON THE LOOKING GLASS
Zack reacts as he sees the young girl thrown into the water.

ZACK
My god.

Zack turns to Julie, who sits in the back of the boat with a
blanket wrapped around Ted’s shoulders.

ZACK
Hang on!

Zack slams the throttle forward. Nate is thrown off his feet
and lands hard on the deck.
81.

ANGLE - THE ROOF OF THE MERCEDES

Taylor dives out as far as he can from the car. The Mercedes
sinks from sight with an eruption of bubbles.

UNDERWATER - J.C.

The circle of piranha surges inward, striking at J.C... but
J.C. swims under the sinking car.

PIRANHA P.O.V. - SONAR VISION

J.C.’s SILHOUETTE merges with the shape of the car, causing
her to disappear as she swims beneath it’s chassis.

UNDERWATER - CAR

The piranhas’ attack dissolves into confusion as J.C. swims
the length of the chassis and comes up the other side.

CLOSER - ALPHA FISH

He wheels about, scanning for her. But the formation of fish
behind him has broken up into a feeding frenzy.

ANGLE ON TAYLOR

Taylor swims for his life. He only slows down to make sure
the boat sees him.

TAYLOR
(waves)
Please, help!!!

J.C. surfaces a short distance behind him, swimming like an
Qlympic athlete!

Taylor can’t believe his eyes. He gets back into the race,
swimming for all he’s worth.
EXT. UNDERWATER - ALPHA FISH P.O.V.

The piranha’s sonar focuses up on two nice loud targets
SPLASHING away in unison; J.C. and Taylor.

ANGLE ON ZACK

He’s astonished to see the TURBULENCE closing in on Taylor
and J.C.
82.

ZACK
(to Julie)
Take the wheel!
ANGLE ON J.C. - UNDERWATER

She’s swimming all out... then we hear her knee POP as she
snap kicks. J.C. winces in pain.

THE LOOKING GLASS

Nate takes hold of Ted as Julie springs forward and grabs the
wheel.

ZACK
Cut it as close to her as you can.

JULIE
What are you...?

Zack races to the back of the boat.
CLOSER - J.C.

She digs into the water fighting the pain, powered by fear of
what’s behind her... and outrage at the bastard ahead of her
She slowly gains on Taylor.

Taylor and J.C. are neck and neck. The TURBULENCE is right
on top of them, no more than a few feet and closing fast.

J.C. grabs Taylor’s ponytail and jerks back with all her
might. Taylor SCREAMS like a little girl. J.C. swims right
over him.

 

She’s gained a few yards, but the piranha close in for the
kill. The TURBULENCE steam rolls over Taylor, who’s pulled
down, SHRIEKING in agony.

BACK ON THE BOAT

 

Zack hooks a foot in a wide SLALOM SKI in the aft of the

boat, grabs a coil of tow rope and leaps out into the boat’s
wake.

Zack hits hard, shooting up a wall of spray... but he hangs
on and rises up out of the water.

Julie bears down on the throttle, heading straight for J.C.

Zack quickly shoots up over the wake, sails through mid air
and lands wide of the boat.
83.

J.C.

She’s swimming for all she’s worth, BUT THE CHURNING WATER
ROLLS RIGHT OVER HER!

ZACK

Leans into the water in a full horizontal. He plows straight
into the swarm at full speed.

A wall of water explodes up. Looks like a wipe out!
CLOSER

Then Zack pulls free, surfacing with one arm wrapped around
J.C., the other still hanging onto the tow rope!

He cheated the swarm a split second before it would have
stripped J.C. to the bone.

THE LOOKING GLASS

Julie pulls them to safety, then loops the boat around in a
u-turn to pick them up. She cuts the boat’s engines. Nate
scrambles to the rear of the boat as Zack scrambles up the
short ladder with J.C.

Nate pulls J.C. in. She collapses to the floor, still wide-
eyed and panting hard. She grasps her knee in pain.

Zack kneels down beside J.C. on the floor of the glass bottom
boat.

ZACK
(softly)
Take it easy, you’re safe now.
SHOCK CUT - GLASS BOTTOM

Taylor’s bloody face appears inches from J.C. pressed up
against the glass... still alive!

He pounds his fists on the glass as the piranha rip his flesh
from his bones.

Zack pulls J.C. to the gunnel. When they look back, Taylor’s
remains are being dragged down into the darkness by the
swarm... gone for good.

CUT TO:

EXT. SAND BAR DECK - SAME TIME

Lil’ John is joined on stage by the rest of his crew as their
hip hop CHANT reaches a crescendo. The crowd jumps to the
pounding beat.

EXT. SAND BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE

Rodriguez is doing his best to please Sheriff Dobbs. Dobbs
is backed up by two of his deputies.

DOBBS
We’re shutting you down. I want
these people out of here, now.

RODRIGUEZ
Sheriff, I’m sure there must be...

Sheriff Dobbs and his deputies react to a loud off camera
screech of rending wood.

EXT. SAND BAR - DECK

ANGLE - PYLONS

The central pylon TEARS LOOSE and the entire deck finally
breaks free with a terrifying SCREECH of wood and metal.

QUICK CUTS - PARTY

The deck tips down at a gut-wrenching angle sending a wave of
partygoesrs sliding across the dance floor... several hit the
rail and flip over into the darkness.

ANGLE ON BAR DOORWAY

The Sheriff races out and is taken by surprise by the sharp
angle of the deck. His feet shoot out from under him and he
slides straight down into the darkness, past SCREAMING
patrons clinging to the wreckage.

ANGLE ON THE WATER

Sheriff Dobbs SPLASHES down in a spray of water. He
surfaces, shocked, GASPING for air.

SHERIFF’S P.O.V.

Dozens of piranha leap up out of the water, teeth FLASHING.
85.

EXT. UNDERWATER - TAYLOR’S CARCASS

Hundreds of piranha fight for the last morsels.

Alpha Fish drifts up into the foreground, chomping down a bit
of Taylor’s flesh. He hears the sound of MULTIPLE SPLASHES,
and surges forward with deadly purpose.

The swarm accelerates like a whirling tornado and streams
after him.

EXT. DECK - SAME TIME

Marcus clutches the bar and hangs on as drinks slide by him.
SYDNEY

Grabs her high bar table, which is bolted to the floor... but
Reggie slides straight down into the tangle of partygoers and
slides SCREAMING off the deck. He hits the rail at full
speed, SMASHES straight through it.

ANGLE ON THE WATER

Reggie tumbles downward and SPLASHES into the water with
dozens of other partiers.

SYDNEY - AT THE TABLE

She SCREAMS as a HUGE CRACK appears, traveling along the deck
beneath her feet. The floor under their table is breaking
away .

Wood GROANS as the split grows wider... then with a deafening
ROAR, the section of deck breaks away!

MASTER

We see it all as half of the party breaks away. The wood
SQUEALS like a huge sequoia going down. Pylons crumble. The
deck collapses into trash, taking dozens of victims with it

Multiple SPLASHES of people and debris send explosions of
spray into the air.

REGGIE

Surfaces, sputtering for air just as a half ton of shattered
wood SWATS him like a fly.
86.

EXT. WATER - THE LOOKING GLASS

Julie, at the helm, reacts to the sight of the collapsing
deck... the SCREAMS of the partygoers.

JULIE
Oh my god...

Julie watches in stunned disbelief. Then she sees the
TURBULENCE swirl about... sweeping towards the victims. She
hits the gas and veers the boat around.

UNDERWATER - PIRANHA P.O.V.

Sonar defines dozens of swimmers thrashing in the water as
more splash down.

ALPHA FISH

Leads the charge straight at the wide array of victims.

THE WATER

The piranhas strike! Horrified victims are dragged, kicking
and SCREAMING beneath the surface as they water churns with
blood.

SYDNEY’S TABLE

Is on the very edge of a sheer drop, tilted at a radical
angle. Sydney hangs on for dear life as less fortunates
tumble by.

CLOSER - BENEATH TABLE

Two bolts EXPLODE off the table’s base. It swings out over
the edge as if on a hinge.

Sydney clings to the table as it swings down... and jerks to
a halt, hanging upside down. She’s whiplashed off, SCREAMING
as she tumbles into darkness.

MOVING CAMERA - HORROR MASTER SHOT

Half-skeletal victims thrash in the churning water (CG and

makeup FX). A victim who won’t give up, drags himself onto
shore, covered in lashing piranhas. The lower part of his

torso is missing! Sydney breaks surface in the foreground,
SCREAMING with half her face torn off.
87.

ANGLE ON THE LOOKING GLASS

Dozens of panicked swimmers grab at the Looking Glass... all
on one side. Their weight threatens to capsize the boat.

NATE
No, no! Don’t do that...!

J.C. grabs the gunnels for support. Julie GUNS the engine.

But the weight of the swimmers turns the boat in a tight
circle... sending it across the wreckage.

ANGLE ON GLASS BOTTOM

The twisted STEEL RODS of the stump of a pylon SCRAPES along
the glass bottom of the boat... CRACKING the glass!

ANGLE ON THE BAR

It hangs at forty-five degrees, literally swinging in the
wind. Marcus is scared shitless, clinging to his swivel
chair, one in the row bolted to the bar. He grabs a shot of
tequila as it slides by, sucks it down.

CARRIE
What’s happening, Marcus?!

MARCUS
(freaked out)
I didn’t mean for anybody to get
hurt, I...

CARRIE
What?! You knew this would happen?

MARCUS
No, I...

Carrie grabs him by the collar and pulls him across the bar.

CARRIE
Talk to me, Marcus!

MARCUS
(starts to cry)
The quake... it busted the pylons
somehow .

With an ominous GROAN, the bar tilts further.
88.

CARRIE
What the hell’s in the water?

MARCUS
I don’t know, swear to God...

MARCUS LOOKS DOWN

One of Lil’ John’s powerful spotlights is now pointing
straight down.

Carrie notices that the shadows of the piranha are avoiding

the circle of light... scattering as it swings back and
forth.
CARRIE
Whatever they are, they don’t like
the light.

Marcus now sees the Looking Glass, hung up on wreckage and
surrounded by the mayhem.

MARCUS
Holy shit... Julie!

ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

Lil’ John and two of his rap crew are stranded, clinging to a
six by six chunk of debris.

People are being torn to pieces all around them as their
makeshift raft tilts/sinks.

Piranhas swarm up the incline, leaping over one another to
tear into Rap Crew #1 and #2. They tumble into the churning
water, kicking and screaming.

Lil’ John hangs onto the highest tip of the sinking wreckage.
He pulls a 9MM out of the back of his pants and starts
BLASTING away.

LIL’ JOHN
(freaking)
I eat fish!!! Motha fuckin’ fish
do NOT EAT ME!

And, he’s actually a damn good shot, nailing leaping piranha
like a skeet shooter. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

Then one SNAPS onto the wrist of his gun hand! Two more
strike his throat like arrows and CHOMP DOWN, tails lashing.
89.

Lil’ John’s gun finger is still twitching, CLICKING on empty
chambers as a half-dozen piranha strike his bare, tattooed
chest. Lil’ John finally collapses into the churning water.
EXT. SAND BAR - SPOTLIGHT

Marcus stands on Carrie’s shoulders, climbing the side of the
building.

MARCUS
C’mon, hurry!

She boosts him higher...

Marcus gets a hand hold and pulls himself up to the powerful
SPOTLIGHT mounted on an upper corner of the building.

Marcus grabs hold and the spotlight FLARES into CAMERA.

EXT. WATER - LOOKING GLASS
Julie guns the engines, but the boat is stuck solid.
Water seeps through the cracks in the glass bottom boat.

Rabid piranhas BUMP and THRASH against it, trying to get to
their victims. The weakened glass spiderwebs further

JULIE
Zack... get Ted!
Nate looks back... the entire swarm is now heading for their
boat.
NATE

There’s nowhere to go!
Suddenly the glass bottom BURSTS! A fountain of piranha
spouts up onto the deck. The boat is instantly flooded with
rising water and SNAPPING piranha.
Julie drags Ted up on the narrow gunnel as the ship sinks.

Zack and J.C. scramble up to the highest point on the bow,
but they are all going down with the ship, no hope in sight

JULIE
Swim for it!

Zack holds J.C.’s hand as they jump into the water.

Julie eases Ted into the water, calls to Nate.
90.

JULIE
Hurry!

Nate takes a last look behind them. It’s too late. The
swarm is almost upon them. They’1ll never make it to the
shore.

Julie plows through the waist-deep water dragging Ted... but
turns when she realizes that Nate isn’t behind them.

JULIE
Nate?!

Nate grabs one of the last waterproof flares in his hand.

NATE
(to Julie)
Go! Get out of here!

Nate turns back to the rear of the sinking boat. Julie has
no choice but to continue her race to the shore.

Nate CRACKS the fuse cap on the flare as he fights his way to
the rear of the boat. The bright blue/white FLARE is nearly
blinding.

A leaping Piranha strikes Nate in the shoulder, ripping deep
into the flesh. Another sinks its teeth into his forearm.
Nate SCREAMS as blood gushes, but he’s reached his goal...
the big twin engines at the rear of the boat.

Nate desperately twists off the gas cap. He takes a last
look at the approaching swarm.

NATE
Sayonara, you little bastards.

Nate jams the flare in the open tank just as the swarm
reaches the boat.

 

KA-THOOM! The half-submerged engine blows in a thunderous
ball of fire... the second engine ignites a split second
later.

Julie turns back to see the boat rise up out of the water as

it’s blown to pieces... fire, spray and fish bits fill the
air.
THE SWARM

It doubles back on itself as the fireball erupts. Nate has
given his life to buy his friends a few precious seconds.
91.

Julie drags Ted as Zack helps J.C. thrash through the water
in a race to shore. The swarm regroups and is closing in
fast!

Julie stumbles into a floating corpse... nearly falls with
Ted in her arms.

ZACK
Julie!

The foremost row of piranhas reaches her, leaping up out of
the water. Suddenly a BLINDING LIGHT pierces the darkness
flaring off the water all around them.

REVERSE

It’s Lil’ John’s spotlights! Marcus and Carrie man the two
monster ARC LIGHTS, focusing them on our heroes.

The swarm scatters, but swirls threateningly just beyond the
ring of light. Our heroes suddenly have a chance.

MARCUS
(yells)
FOLLOW THE LIGHT!

Julie carries Ted through the waist-deep water. Zack
protects J.C. as the angelic shaft of light surrounds them.
Piranha thrash a few yards away, angry at losing their meal.
EXT. BANK - CONTINUOUS

A dying victim clutches at Julie. She doesn’t pause, but
drags Ted straight up the incline, until they are far from
harm’s way.

EXT. SHORELINE - CONTINUOUS

Zack and J.C. scramble to safety as a fire truck pulls up in
the B.G. Firemen rush to help others still struggling to get
out of the water.

EXT. CREST OF EMBANKMENT

Julie drops to her knees, exhausted, as she finally reaches
safety. She carefully eases Ted back onto the soft grass.

He looks as if he’s close to death. His voice is a barely
audible rasp.
92.

TED
...-help me.

Julie pulls him closer.

JULIE
What... what can I do?

Ted raises his arm, looking beyond Julie. She realizes he’s
pointing to something behind her. We hear an unsettling
electronic HUM... growing louder and louder. Julie turns.

JULIE’S P.O.V.

A large TRAILER is the source of the humming, a heavy-duty
gas powered GENERATOR attached to the back of Lil’ John’s
equipment truck. It’s the power source for all his lights
and amps... parked only a few yards away.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Julie looks from the gennie, back down the embankment. It’s

directly in line with the swarm, which is in a feeding frenzy
on the remains of dozens of victims.

 

TED
..kill them. Kill them all.

Julie helps Ted rise. He leans heavily on her as they make
it to the gennie.
EXT. SHORELINE - CONTINUOUS

Marcus and Carrie hurry down to Nate and J.C. Firemen tend
to victims in the B.G.

MARCUS
Where’s Julie?

C.U. - GENERATOR SWITCHES

Ted’s fingers travel down the row of switches, flicking them
all to MAX. We hear the generator’s engine REV loudly in
response. The gauges hit red, over a hundred thousand volts.

Ted, with great effort, manages to stand on his own two feet.
He grabs the latch on the trailer hitch, but it won’t budge.

TED
(to Julie)
...do it.
93.

Julie SLAMS open the trailer hitch.
ANGLE ON ZACK
As he realizes what Julie is about to attempt
ZACK
(softly)
My god...
ANGLE ON JULIE

She throws her weight behind the trailer. Smoke pours out of
the overheating generator.

The tires slowly start to roll down the embankment.
ANGLE ON THE SURVIVORS

Everyone’s attention is drawn to the huge generator as it
CRASHES through the brush, picking up speed.

MASTER

The generator hits the curb of the retaining wall at full
speed. Does a half-flip, up and over...

Beat.
There is a deafening CLAP OF THUNDER and a blinding FLASH of
electricity as the half-ton generator hits the surface of the
water.

A spiderweb of CRACKLING electrical energy dances across the
inlet.

UNDERWATER

A_ shuttering ELECTRONIC PULSE rips through the entire swarm.

 

ALPHA FISH

Alpha Fish’s eyes EXPLODE as the arc of power blazes through
him

THE GENERATOR

It’s a flickering light show as it sinks to the bottom of the
lake. It shorts out in a final eruption of fiery bubbles.
94.

THE SURFACE

Beat. One by one, the corpses of the piranha bob to the
surface... dozens... hundreds.

THE EMBANKMENT

Julie looks to Ted, the exuberance of their victory lifting
her from exhaustion. Ted manages a weary smile.

TED
It worked...

Julie embraces him; tucking her head into his shoulder.
ANGLE ON MARCUS
He gingerly picks a smoking piranha carcass up by the tail.
MARCUS
Check it out... any of you mother
fuckers bring tartar sauce?
Marcus takes a big crunchy bite out of the piranha’s flank.

ANGLE - EMBANKMENT

Julie and Ted appear on the edge of the embankment, gazing
down at their handy work.

CAMERA BOOMS UP

From the C.U. of Julie’s haunted, exhausted gaze... wider
