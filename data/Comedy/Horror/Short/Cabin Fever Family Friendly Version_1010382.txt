~~

EXT. FOREST - DUSK
A gorgeous vista, green and lush.

Beneath the canopy of branches, a small brook babbles over
moss covered rocks.

A bullfrog CROAKS loudly from its perch atop what looks
like... a human leg?

Sure enough, it’s attached to A BODY semi-submerged in the
water -- unrecognizable in the rapidly darkening light.

BEGIN CREDITS

TIME ELLIPSE: Dusk gives way to night. The moon casts a
blue hue over the woods. The sun rises, illuminating the
body for the first time.

It’s PAUL. His clothing is largely torn away, revealing
purple flesh swollen with open sores. There is the dull hum
of swarming flies.

A shaft of sun carves its way through the thick nest of
branches and creeps across the glistening water. It travels
Paul’s torso, up to his neck. As the light hits his face,
his eyelids unexpectedly BURST OPEN and Paul tries to scream,
but only rasping air escapes his lips.

As he struggles to his feet - blood, puss, even small chunks
of skin splash into the water.

We follow the swirling GORE as it’s carried off downstream.

EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS

PULL BACK, widening our view of the forest and following the
route of the strean.

We RACE its course, across a meadow until we reach:

EXT. WATER BOTTLING PLANT - MORNING
CLOSE ON a sign reading: “Down Home Spring Water”

The stream dead enda into a man made pond, from which
protrude several enormous steel pipes.

INT. BOTTLING PLANT - CONTINUOUS

We follow the pipes into the Plant, and then the route of the
water through the production line. The water gets pumped
into holding tanks, then into the individual bottles. The
company slogan appears on each and every plastic container:
“Down Home Purity - From Us to You...”
EXT, FOREST ~- MORNING, LATER

Paul looks around dizzily for orientation. Dense forest on
three sides. Beside him, a steep embankment and at its
crest, he sees something. A passing CAR? A road?

He takes a few steps, clearly intent to make the climb, then
notices something on his bare chest. A leech. He plucks it
away. And sees another. And another. He’s covered in them!

He panics, tearing them off his flesh with wild-eyed disgust,
each bloated leech leaving behind an oozing wound.

EXT. EMBANKMENT, MOMENTS LATER

Paul crawls his way up the steep incline. The progress is
taxing. CRACK! His ankle buckles, twisting at a sharp angle
and shooting a thick stream of blood.

Paul’s watering eyes squeeze closed, but he does not stop.

EXT. ROAD ~ MOMENTS LATER

Paul reaches the summit, his heart pounding in his head. The
world is spinning as he limps, delirious, into the road...

WHAP! A school bus smashes through Paul, instantly
liquefying him and exploding his contents over the front
grill. His remains are shotput twenty yards, then cartwheel
down the embankment and SPLASH land back into the stream.

The bus wheels screech as the vehicle skids to a stop. The
road fills with the sound of SCREAMING CHILDREN.

EXT. ROAD, ACCIDENT SCENE - LATER

The school bus and its hysterical occupants are surrounded by
lit flares. The unconscious BUS DRIVER is loaded into a
waiting ambulance.

The only other officials on the scene - two FOREST RANGERS,
one male, one female - are pulling barricades across the
road. She’s young and frumpy. The Male Ranger [20s,
buzzcut] is clearly quite high on his responsibilities.

A SHERIFF’S CRUISER arrives, lights flashing. The door opens
and WINSTON’S booted leg glides to the pavement. He
approaches the bus, full swagger in his step.

END CREDITS
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

It’s mayhem. Kids are Screaming, crying, some have already
been sick and others are on the verge.

REVEAL Winston, impatiently competing for their attention.

WINSTON

Kids, I’m Deputy Winston.

(no response)
All right now. If we can all just
settle down. Settle. Everything
is under control.

(still nothing)
All right! I’m going to need you
to shut up! Just shut the hel. up!

The wailing intensifies. Winston tugs his hair in
frustration... then pulls his GUN. This seems to work: A
HUSH falls over the bus. The kids stare, saucer-eyed.

WINSTON
Good. Thank you. Now look, the
bus seems to have hit a moose or
something. We’re gonna get you off
to school very soon okay?

A LITTLE BOY raises his hand. Winston lets the boy wait a
moment before calling on him.

WINSTON
Yeah?

LITTLE BOY
Can I go to the baf-room?

A chorus of high-pitched voices erupt. Everyone has to go to
the goddamn bathroom. Winston’s world threatens to plunge
back into chaos, so he holds up his gun: a reminder. The
HUSH descends. Winston indicates to the boy.

WINSTON
What number?

The boy slowly raises two fingers.
WINSTON
No. No fucking way.
EXT. ROAD, ACCIDENT SCENE - LATER
Winston is done. Investigation over. In the background, the

Male Ranger is dutifully inspecting the bus. Winston and the
Female Ranger light cigarettes.
WINSTON
So, how’s it going?
(awkwardly flirtatious)
I got a forty in my cruiser...

The Male Ranger peels a strip of bloody cloth out of the
buses grill. It’s part of a pants leg.

MALE RANGER
Found something! Don’t think deer
wear American Eagle.

WINSTON
It was a deer. Let’s get these
kids to school. Or home. Wherever
the fuck they go.

The Male Ranger has now followed the splatter to the edge of
the embankment. He looks down and calls out:

MALE RANGER
There’s a trail of blood - seems to
go down this hill!

WINSTON
Okay then - let’s wrap things up.

The Male Ranger approaches, gets right in Winston’s face.

MALE RANGER
Look, something died here and I
take that real serious. You need
to go somewhere, that’s fine by me.
T‘ll put it in my report. I know
over-promoted incompetence when I
see it, “Deputy.”

FEMALE RANGER
Maybe we should check into this a
little further.
Winton sighs deeply, worn down.
WINSTON
Fine! Fine. We’ll poke around a
bit. Jesus.
The rumble of an approaching large vehicle -- it’s a Down
Home Water Bottle delivery truck. Winston waves it past.
INT. WATER TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

The DRIVER eyes the disaster with disgust.
DRIVER
Fucking gross.

cur TO:

EXT. A DIFFERENT ROAD - MORNING

The Water Bottle delivery truck proceeds on it’s journey. PAN
to see a sign which reads: “Leaving Bunyon County”

EXT. FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY

The truck merges with city traffic.

EXT. BIG CITY - DAY

The truck drives past a SPORTS STADIUM...
But we don’t stop.

Later: WE DRIVE PAST...CITY HALL...

But we don’t slow down.

WE DRIVE PAST...AN OLD FOLKS HOME...

We make turns onto a suburban RESIDENTIAL STREET. We drive
Past UPSCALE HOUSES and up to a LARGE HIGH SCHOOL.

The truck passes the entrance. The high school is spared?
No. The truck STOPS SUDDENLY. The white reverse lights
illuminate. The truck backs up, stops, and then TURNS INTO
THE HIGH SCHOOL DRIVEWAY.

EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

The truck pulls up to the curb. It comes to rest by the
school entrance.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

The DRIVER is wheeling the hand-truck down the hallway. We
pass all kinds of regular high school activity: kids talking
at lockers, kids walking around, kids making out. Some
attach balloons along the walls of the hallway.

We pass through a set of doors into...
INT. MI. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCHROOM
Kids are eating, talking, horsing around.

The Driver pushes the water across the length of the
lunchroom. Kids bob and weave out of his way.

He pulls up to the front of the line and hoists a CASE OF
BOTTLED WATER onto the counter. The LUNCH LADY glares at
him, annoyed.

LUNCH LADY
Yeah just drop that anywhere.

A SKINNY GIRL moving through the Line reaches for one of the
driver’s new bottles. As her hand touches it, she hesitates
and then... decides on a SODA.

A FAT GIRL moving through the line reaches for one of the
bottles. She hesitates. Instead, she grabs two large
CHOCOLATE MILKS.

ZACH, our hero, pulls a water right from the case. He’s a
small guy, with obvious potential and kind features.

Waiting for the Lunch Lady’s attention, he opens the bottle
and is JUST ABOUT TO SIP when A HAND SMACKS it away from his
lips. The open bottle skitters across the floor.

Zach turns to face DOUG, a towering, beady-eyed asshole.

DOUG
(under his breath)
Oops, sorry faggot.

Doug waltzes off. Zach grabs an Orange Juice.

LUNCH LADY
{ringing Zach up)
OK, so that’s one water, one OJ...
(to the Truck Driver)
Put it all back there.

The Lunch Lady gestures toward’s the storage room.

The driver slides the case off of the counter and returns it
to the hand-truck. As he wheels to the back room - BAM!

TWO JOCKS, JACK and BOB, tackle each other, SMASHING into his
hand cart. The tower of water wobbles.

JACK
Sorry. My bad.

BOB
Yeah. Our bad.
7.
Jack and Bob brush themselves off and walk away. The Lunch
Lady and Driver continue to the back room.

As they walk, we see TWO BOTTLES HAVE BEEN TAKEN from the
driver’s cases!!! Nobody notices.

While he pushes the bottles behind the Lunch Lady...

We see Jack and Bob pulling their STOLEN WATER BOTTLES out
from beneath their jackets.

JACK
Sweet.

BOB
You owe me a buck.
INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - SAME

The two Jocks burst through the lunchroom doors. They move
down the locker-lined corridor clutching their prize water.

BOB

The limo, it’s got like four tv’s!
JACK

Holy shit! We can totally--
BOB

Watch the Game!

BOB JACK
Go Panthers! Go Panthers!

They high-five as they round a corner. Jack turns toward’s
the school exit. Bob stops.

BOB (CONT’D)
Where you going?

JACK
I’ve got a few things to take care
of. A little last minute romance.

BOB
(concerned)
I‘1l see you later, right?

Jack opens the bottle and takes a swig in SALUTE as he heads
out the door, into the sunlight.
INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Bob is mid-stride. He passes two GIRLS, NATASHA [preppy,
cute, jaded cheerleader] and KATIE [high-strung busybody. }
The girls are not friends, just locker neighbors.

BOB
Hey Natasha.

NATASHA
You seen Jack?

BOB
Your boyfriend just took off.
Making preps for the special night.

NATASHA
YOUR boyfriend, you mean?

Bob stares at her dumbly.

KATIE
She’s kidding, silly.

NATASHA
Not really.

BOB
You going to Prom, Katie?

KATIE
Of course! Prom is going to be
amazing, aren’t you pumped?! I’m
on the decorating committee, so I
can assure you - it’s going to be,
like, totally beautiful.

BOB
(being nice)
Total touchdown.
NATASHA
Please, please stop speaking in
Football-ese.

Katie retrieves several blister packs of allergy medication
from her bag, then eyes Bob’s bottle of water.

KATIE
Hey. Can I have that?

BOB
Uh...sure. Yeah.

Bob tosses and SHE CATCHES IT.
BOB
(to Katie)
See you later.
(to Natasha)
Take another Valium, kay?

KATIE
(oblivious)
Okay! See ya, Bob!

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS - DAY

Zach confers with best-friend SHAMS [loudmouth, endearing
geek-prince] while removing books from their lockers. Bob
passes behind them, CHANTING the school Fight Rally.

ZACH
(shocked)
Wait... what are you gonna do?

SHAMS
I’m gonna shave my nuts! All the
pros do it. Every one.

ZACK
I doubt that Katie will venture
anywhere near your nuts.

SHAMS
Yeah, I can’t believe she’s
date. But at least I had the balls
to ask someone.

ZACH
You and your hairy, hairy balls.

They both laugh, close their lockers, and shuffle off.

EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, PARKING LOT - DAY

“MOOSE,” a huge and eager student bearing more than a passing
resemblance to his nickname, squeezes out of an old Volvo
filled with KEGS. He looks to a group of kids smoking.

MOOSE
KEGS BABY!

Moose jogs over to join CHRIS WELCH, the cool, rich, uber-
stud (Part Spader, Part Stifler), his friend TYLER (silent,
tough guy] and part-time shadow, Doug [the asshole.]

MOOSE (CONT’D)
My Uncle saw me lifting the stuff
from his store. Can’t go back...
10.

Chris holds out a fist full of bills.

CHRIS
Fine. But we still need ice, cups,
Jello, funnels, hoses - you know
the drill. Get everything you can.

MOOSE
Okay. I have a club card. It’s
got dynamite savings. Dynamite.

CHRIS
Drop the gear outside my house.
Come back for the party at seven.

MOOSE
You got it!

Moose starts squeezing himself back into the tiny car. Chris
heads towards the school with Tyler and Doug.

CHRIS
to Moose)
And don’t invite any dicks.

DOUG
Yeah. No dicks.

CHRIS
Shut up, Doug.

Doug smolders.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Chris, flanked by Doug and Tyler, walks with great purpose.
Everybody acknowledges him. He owns this place.

They pass: a handsome loner, always referred to by his last
name - WEBER, putting stuff in his locker. He hates school.
Hates most things.

VAL an UNATTRACTIVE bespectacled girl, stands beside him.

VAL
Go to Prom with me?
WEBER
No.
VAL
Why not?
WEBER

No.
11.

VAL
Please?

WEBER
No.

The trio NEXT cross paths with Zach and Shams. As they pass,
Doug SHOULDERS Zach as hard as he can, knocking him into the
lockers with a painful BANG.

DOUG
Oops. Sorry, faggot.

Chris stops. Looks at Zach with dim recognition, then
surprising sympathy.

CHRIS
(to Doug)
Dude. Not cool.

DOUG
(innocently)
What?

CHRIS
(to Tyler)
I’ll catch up with you guys later.

Tyler and Doug reluctantly but obediently trudge up the hall.
It’s just Chris, Zach, and Shams. Awkward,

ZACH
Hey there, Chris.

CHRIS
Zach-ster. What up?

SHAMS:

(over-eager, very uncool)
Chris - you know I was thinking, I
sould totally hook you up with some
killer gear for your next party -
smoke machines, mirror balis — my
cousin works at this theatrical
lighting company...

CHRIS
(interrupting)
So Zach, you got a sec?
(re: Shams)
In private?

It’s tough to say “no” to the most popular guy in school.
Shams (for once) recognizes when he’s not wanted.
12.

SHAMS
Don’t mind me. I’11 just go to the
parking lot and suck exhaust from
someone‘s tailpipe.

CHRIS
absently)
Sounds great, you do that.

Chris wraps an arm around Zach’s shoulders and leads him off.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH - DIFFERENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Chris and Zach head briskly down the hall. Chris manages to
greet every (worthy) passerby without breaking atride. It’s
second nature to him.

CHRIS
You know I’ve always liked you
Zach. I mean, we were practically
best friends.

ZACH
That was like, in the second grade.
We’ve barely spoke since.

CHRIS
Yeah, well... you know how it is.
But back then, you always stood up
for me, and I swore I’d never
forget it. Seeing that it’s almost
the end of senior year and you’re
probably gonna disappear to some
freaky private school...

ZACH
I was accepted to Princeton.

CHRIS

(taken aback)
Princeton? No shit?

(sighs it off)
Cool, man. Well, anyway I think
it’s high time you attend one of my
parties. And my pre-prom blowout
is going to be the best yet. You
can’t miss it.

ZACH
I don’t know what to say. I’m
supposed to be honored, right?

CBRIS
Fuckin-A you are. And bring your
date - she’1ll think you’re a
fucking Rock Star.

(MORE)
13.
CHRIS (cont'd)

(pauses, concerned)
Unless she’s a troll. Who is she?

ZACH
Chris, I appreciate the thought--

CHRIS

You don‘t have a date. No prob,
there’1l be plenty of trim there.

(considering)
Zach, you ever seen honest to God,
real-life teenage breasts?

(off zach’s blank stare)
Just answer the question.

ZACH
No. No I haven’t. Happy now?

CHRIS
Not happy, but I better understand
how you’ve found time to get into
the Ivy Leagues. Please accompany
me on the next stop on my rounds.

They continue through double doors that wheeze closed behind
them. The doors read: “Girls Locker Room”

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH - GIRL‘S LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Ladies are in various stages of undress; they remove FIELD
HOCKEY UNIFORMS AND SHOWER. A few, standing by lockers spot
the invading boys. A nervous girl, WENDY, throws on a towel.

WENDY
Chris...!

Zach nervously follows Chris into the room, looking around.
JANINE, an angry girl who is half dressed, steps forward.

JANINE
Get out!

CHRIS
Don’t worry, Chubbs. We’re not
looking at ya.
Janine, now humiliated, turns away.

Chris walks right into the shower room. Zach pauses,
shielding his eyes (but peeking through his fingers.)

Naked girls cover themselves, turn off the water and run, or
grab towels. LESLIE, a female nerd, runs away from Chris.

LESLIE
What the fuck, Chris?
14.

CHRIS
I’ve got big news to tell my girl.

SASHA, a gorgeous blonde, stands beside BROOKE, a cute
Brunette. They grab towels. Chris addresses Sasha.

CHRIS
It’s happening, Sash. Seven
o’clock. Okay?

Sasha runs up and hugs Chris. They share a kiss. Sasha
turns to Brooke.

SASHA
Brooke! Are you so excited?

BROOKE
Um... sure. Another party?

CHRIS
Party of the century. Literally.
I may never even make it to Prom.

Brooke exits the shower. Sasha's eyes harden.

SASHA
You're making it to Prom. We're
making it to Prom! I’ve been
getting ready for six months.

CHRIS
(interrupting)
Sure, baby. Whatever you say.

The girls in the locker room start taking an interest. Two
BOOKWORM GIRLS, MARIE AND GINA, approach Chris.

MARIE
Can I come?

GINA
Who’s invited?

Chris looks at all the girls.
CHRIS.

Hmmm. Let me see. You... You...
and seseeeee YOu.

 

MEANWHILE Zach can’t take his eyes off BROOKE. She’s started
getting dressed and seems to have little interest in the
antics around her. She’s very pretty in a tough, no nonsense
sort of way. Zach likes her a lot.

Wendy, still wearing just a towel, walks over nervously.
15.

WENDY
Chris? Can I come?

Chris looks at her. There’s a long beat. Slowly, she opens
her towel and shows him her BOOBS.

CHRIS
--.Sure. Yeah.

Wendy goes bananas. She hugs her friends like she’s won on
“The Price is Right.”

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - AFTERNOON

Lab partners Zach and Shams are huddled over a half-dissected
frog, an open textbook beside them.

SHAMS
Chris. That guy is SO dick.

ZACH
He is what he is.
(offering the scalpel)
You want to try?

SHAMS:
Hell no. You’re the brains of this
outfit.

ZACH

What does that make you?

SHAMS
The non-virgin.

ZACH
You know, lies make Jesus cry.

Shams observes as Zach’s dextrous hands perform the
dissection flawlessly. He’s no small talent.

ZACH (CONT’D)
(stuck in memory)
I still can’t believe I was in the
Girls locker room.

SHAMS
I can’t believe you saw Brooke
naked and your head didn’t fucking
explode.

Zach removes one of the frogs legs.

SHAMS
That fucker is so glad he’s dead.
16.

ZACH
Actually, if done right the frog
could survive an amputation like
this quite easily, and with
surprisingly little pain.

SHAMS
Good to know. So. What was it
that Lord Chris wanted exactly?

Zach averts his friends eyes; hesitant, uncomfortable.

INT. “HAMBURGER HUT” - AFTERNOON

Shams and Zach share a table with pals ERIC and SCOTT, both
uber-geeks, each wearing vintage “Atari” T-Shirts.

SHAMS
What do you mean you’re not going?
Of course we’re going!

ZACH
He didn’t exactly invite “us.”

scorTT
Tonight’s our X-Box tournament!
It’s totally set. I got the DSL
line inatalied and everything.

ZACH
I know. I’m psyched.

SHAMS
This is the chance of a lifetime.
You couldn’t possibly prefer to
play fucking videogames!

ERIC
Maybe he would.

SHAMS
As the only one of us with a female
date this evening, let me just
say... Shut the fuck up, Eric.

scorr
Maybe the party would be cool...

SHAMS
(smiles patronizingly)
Dude? No way. Look at yourselves,
never gonna happen.

Scott and Eric look at themselves as instructed.
17.

scorT
(wounded)
Whatever.

Brooke breezes in and takes a seat alone by the window.
She‘s all in black, and looks both moody and intimidating.

ERIC
Dude. Princess Leia. 3 o’Clock.

Their heads turn in unison; Zach's snaps back, mortified.

ZACH
(quietly)
Hey. Let’s not stare, okay?

ERIC
Just go talk to her.

Zach doesn’t budge. Shams stands, theatrically thin on
patience.

SHAMS
This is fucking ridiculous. Zach -
this is how it’s going down. I’m
walking over there. I’m getting
you a fucking prom date. And in
exchange, you’re bringing me, my
date, and her -

(pointing at Brooke)

~ to Chris’s party. End of
discussion.

Before anyone can get a word in edgewise, Shams is moving
across the diner. JZach’s heart rockets into his throat.

ZACH’S POV: Shams approaches Brooke. Introduces himself.
Chats. He CAN’T HEAR what they’re saying. Shams takes a
seat. They keep talking. Brooke starts LAUGHING.

scotr
Holy shit. I think it’s working!

Suddenly Brooke stands and approaches the table. still
smiling, she looks straight at Zach.

BROOKE
It’s Zach, right?

He nods, stupidly.
BROOKE
Please don’t ever sick your greasy,
pea-brained minion on me again.
Next time, just grow a pair, okay?

With that, Brooke heads out the front door.
18.

ERIC scortr
OOOCOOOCO! Et ooooococe!!!

Zach shoots Shama a look; “what the hell?!” Sham’s shrugs
back; “Sorry dude.”

EXT. “HAMBURGER HUT” - CONTINUOUS

Zach chases her out. He gets a hand on her shoulder, turns
her around.

BROOKE
What?

zach is utterly sincere, and visibly nervous. He breaths
deeply and speaks rapidly, not missing a beat.

ZACH
Look, I’m sorry. Fact is, my
friend wasn’t exactly operating at
my request - but I’m not entirely
upset because I’ve been meaning to
talk to you for a long time. Now
that I have your attention I’d like
to pay, I think you’re very
intriguing, not to mention quite
beautiful. I’ve secured an
invitation to Chris’s party, which
at the very least promises to be
very memorable. Of course, tonight
is also prom and due to the
previously discussed “lack of
balls” condition from which I
suffer, I have no date. If you
also are without a date, I’d be
sublimely excited and deeply
honored to take you.

She stares at him ~- then smiles, flattered and charmed.
BROOKE
Okay.
EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON

Winston stands with the two rangers, gazing down at the red
pulp that used to be Paul, dissolving in the stream.

MALE RANGER
That‘s a guy right? Was a guy?

Winston stares, self-conscious and deeply rattled. After
all, he knows exactly how the body got here...

FLASHBACK - CABIN FEVER 1:
19.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

PAUL lies in the back seat as Winston drives, intermittently
sipping from a beer.

PAUL
(voice croaking, dying)
I need... water...

WINSTON
I ain’t got no water man, all I got
is a Forty. But if you want some
water I'll find some for you, okay?
You just sit tight buddy, 1I’11 take
care of you.

CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST ~ NIGHT
Paul lies in the stream.
END FLASHBACK.
DISSOLVE TO:

The Male Ranger prods the body with a stick. It SQUIRTS
liquid, missing him by inches.

WINSTON
I wouldn’t do that.

The Ranger backs off, startled.

MALE RANGER
You know what did this?

WINSTON
A disease, I think. Eats your
flesh right off.

FEMALE RANGER
Nasty!

The Male Ranger looks from the body to the blood carried off
in the water. Eyes widen as he puts two and two together...

MALE RANGER
Oh God. Where do you suppose the
water goes?

WINSTON
Why?
20.

MALE RANGER
What if it feeds a well? Ora
reservoir?

WINSTON
Oh fuck...

MALE RANGER
Exactly.
(re: the stream)
We need to see where this goes.

FEMALE RANGER
(reassuringly, to Winston)
I’1l keep looking for that deer.

MALE RANGER
Contact Fish and Game for
extraction. They can get tissue
samples tested.
(to Winston)
Let’s get a move on.

Winston hangs his head. This is not good.

INT. FOREMAN’S OFFICE, BOTTLING PLANT - AFTERNOON

The disgruntled FOREMAN faces Winston and the two Rangers. He
dabs his sweating brow with a dirty handkerchief.

FOREMAN
Just a little flu. Been going
around and kinda snuck up on me.
I appreciate your concern, but
everything is fine.

MALE RANGER
Do you do any regular tests on the
water itself?

FOREMAN
Water is pure. I drink it all the
time! Everyone here does.

Winston and the Ranger follow his gaze to the factory floor
below. Everything is not fine. WORKERS are universally
suffering from symptoms; coughing, dizziness, fevers.

PAN BACK just as the Foreman grabs a bottle off his desk.
FOREMAN
Gotta stay hydrated. It’s the best
thing.

As the Foreman tilts back his head to drink, they SPOT a
purplish sore on the underside of his chin.
21.

Winston takes a slow step back from the man.

WINSTON
(to Foreman)
Will you excuse us a moment?

INT. HALLWAY, BOTTLING PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Winston and the Ranger talk urgently just outside the office.
The Ranger is chomping at the bit to escalate things.

MALE RANGER
We gotta call the Feds. The FBI--

WINSTON
Hold on a sec. We close this
place, we should have this more or
less contained.

QUICK FLASHBACK: They both recall the image of Winston waving
the water delivery truck past the accident scene.

WINSTON (CONT’D)
shit.

MALE RANGER
(enthuslastic)
I’m making the call!

The Ranger rushes off down the hall.

WINSTON
(to himself)
No one probably drank any...

EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING

Jack pulls his Camaro up to the curb. He leans to the
backseat and grabs his Letterman’s Jacket. We see the
FINISHED WATER BOTTLE LAYING BESIDE IT.

He walks to the back of the car and opens the trunk. Inside
we see flowers, an envelope with Natasha’s name on it, and a
banner. The banner reads: “I LOVE YOU NATASHA”. Jack
squeezes these items into his backpack. He’s pumped.

EXT. NATASHA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A gorgeous two-story home. Jack sneaks up to a window.
Inside, Natasha is trying on a prom dress with her mother.

They’re chatting and having a good time. Jack smiles.

JACK
She‘s gonna love this.
22.

Jack walks around to the backyard, looks up and FINDS a
bedroom window with pink curtains. He smiles again.

Seen from behind, REVEAL that the back of Jack’s neck is
covered in a dripping sore.

He quickly inspects the ivy-covered trellis and begins to
climb. He makes quick progress, though the rough ivy keeps
getting in the way.

WOOOSH! A couple of branches beneath his right foot SNAP,
and he falle about a foot.

CRUNCH! Sharp pieces of wood nick his palm.

JACK
Damn!

Jack keeps moving, wincing as his hands make each grab.
BLOOD trickles down his fingers.

He takes another grab, and his face scrunches in pain. The
sore has spread to his wrist.

JACK
What the..?

The fingers on his left hand slowly open revealing some puss.
The hand loses it’s strength. RIIIIPPP!!!:! HIS HAND SLIDES
BOWN THE IVY, TWIGS TEAR HIS PALMS APART.

He anchors his feet. Tears fill his eyes as he looks down.
It’s almost 20 feet to the ground.

JACK
You can make it.

He closes his eyes, and takes a few more grabs... each time,
losing more skin.

The eave is just a couple of feet further. He stares at the
bedroom. It’s not too far away.

Jack reaches the lip of the eave. He rests for a moment.
SQUAP! A knuckle pops. Blood spurts on his tux.

He locks down again. The ground appears to be swaying. His
breath comes in huge rasps.

JACK
(very faint)
Help...! Help me...!

No one‘s gonna hear. He’s on his own.
23.

In one motion, he SWINGS himself up, landing on the roof! He
is on his stomach, spread-eagle on the black asphalt
shingles. He lays his cheek on the stubbly surface.

Then... his body begins to slide.

JACK
No. No.

He lands on the SHARP EDGE of the rain gutter. KINK!

THE EDGE CUTS HIS HANDS AND FOREARMS. Blood floats along the
white rim. He looks up at the bedroom. Natasha is inside,
changing. Despite the pain, Jack is momentarily distracted.
She’s a hottie.

JACK
Damn.

The sound of BENDING METAL. THE GUTTER GIVES. Jack FALLS.

SNAP! His body folds as he crunches off the patio table and
rolls into a deep thatch of bushes. His face hits the firm
tundra. His backpack bounces onto the lawn.

Jack lays in the bushes, trying to speak. He only gurgles up
a mouthful of blood before passing out.

INT. SHAMS HOUSE - EVENING

Shams is in a suit, rather than a tux. It looks good, though
doesn’t fit quite right. Shams’ house in general is cut from
a lesser cloth.

Shams turns to split, and runs smack into his father,
SARGEANT FRANK [50s, mean.]

SARGEANT FRANK
I’m not bailing your loser ass out
of jail. Whatever this night has
in store, just bear that in mind.

SHAMS
Okay. Right back at you.
EXT. ZACH’S HOUSE - EVENING
Zach runs up the steps of his house. A tuxedo bag is draped

over his shoulder. He has a spring in his step. He flies
through the front door.
24.

INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Zach bounds into the hall, and then up the stairs - taking
them 3 at a time.

Zach enters his bedroom, puts the tux on his bed, and turns
on the stereo. Zach goes to the closet and pulls out
everything he needs.

MONTAGE BEGINS. UPBEAT MUSIC OVER:

INT. BROOKE’S HOUSE - EVENING
Brooke sits at the dinner table with her PARENTS and LITTLE
SISTER. She has her hair setting with curlers and pins. She
clearly isn’t the type for make-up and fancy dress, and
manages to looks both excited and miserable at the same time.
BROOKE’S SISTER
I thought you said - boys, dances,
all that - was bull...

BROOKE’S MOM
Language!

BROOKE
Don’t you have dolls to play with?

BROOKE’S SISTER
Who’d have thought. My sister in
pink.
The two share a laugh.

INT. KATIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

Katie is on the phone in her bedroom. She stands in front of
a full length mirror wearing her prom dress.

KATIE
(on the phone)
I know that I should be there, but
it’s Chris’s party - and this might
be my last chance.
(for emphasis)
Chris's party.

Katie sees a SIX INCH SORE on her left shoulder. She checks
up close. It’s blistering, black and green.

KATIE
Oh my God!
(back to the call)
Not The balloons are in clusters
of five, the streamers get braided.
We talked about this!

She goes to her closet and pulls out A BUNCH OF DRESSES. she
drapes them across herself while looking in the mirror.

One has a high back that will COVER THE SORE.

KATIE
Because Shams invited me. Shams.
My date.
(impatiently)
The guy in Geometry that never
shuts up.

INT. DENTIST OFFICE - EVENING

Doug and Tyler, both in tuxes, struggle with an enormous
steel tank; rolling it on edge towards the door.

DOUG
Move it, fuck-nut. Jesus - you’re
such a little bitch...

VOICE [OFF]
Dougie?

Doug and Tyler instinctively drop the heavy cylinder with a
resounding CLANG. It’s DR. VIOLA, kind-faced and an even
kinder heart, but definitely soft in the head...

DOUG
Dad?
26.

DR. VIOLA
Don’t you boys look handsome. Is
that little Tyler?
{noticing the tank)
What are you doing with my Nitrous?

DOUG
Nitrous? Serious? Ohmygod, I
thought it was Helium.
INT. BANQUET HALL BALLROOM - EVENING
CLOSE ON: Helium balloons being inflated.

Kids are raising a large sign across the wall. It reads:
TIME OF OUR LIVES.

Mr. Sheppard and the lunch-lady are on the dance floor. They
share a modest tango while people work around them.

INT. SCOTT’S BASEMENT - EVENING

Scott ushers Eric into the techno-geek paradise that is his
father’s basement. 42 inch Plasma widescreen. Tower
speakers. Massive amplifier. And resting on it’s own
glorious pedestal... the X-Box.

Scott presses the power button ominously.

scorr
May the mayhem begin.

The boys’ faces are bathed in light as the “HALO 2” opening
graphics fill the screen, and bass rattles the earth.

ERIC
(deeply humbled)
Awesome.

INT. ROADSIDE DINER - EVENING

The TRUCK DRIVER sits at the counter of a small greasy spoon
diner. He has a bottle of water in his right hand. He
finishes chewing his dinner. HE LOOKS SICK.

He coughs out his mouthful of food. BLOOD sprays all over
the counter.

He coughs again. Another. Another. A bigger one. Another.
A waitress ducks out of the way.

Customers scramble to avoid the flying blood.
27.

DINER CUSTOMER 1
Call an ambulance!

DINER CUSTOMER 2
What was he eating?

INT. ZACH’S HOUSE - EVENING

Zach runs down his hallway stairs. He is dressed in his
tuxedo. He carries the corsage. His PARENTS stand by the
open door. They, like Zach, are small and full of warmth.

ZACH’S DAD
I’m so proud of you.

ZACH’S MOM
Look at my little man.

ZACH’S DAD
If you need anything, don’t
hesitate to call, okay?

ZACH
It’s Prom. I think I’1l be okay.

ZACH’S MOM
Did you remember your inhaler?

Zach loves them, but enough with the neurotic babying
already. He kisses them and walks out.

curt TO:

EXT. BROOKE’S HOUSE - EVENING

zach escorts Brooke towards the limo, while her MOM and DAD
snap photos like rabid paparazzi. She looks gorgeous.

Zach opens the limo door for her. He’s about to... but
chickens out of a kiss.

INT. LIMO - EVENING

Zach and Brooke ride in the limo, drinking champagne, and
sharing awkward glances. REVEAL Shams and Katie are also
along. He’s aggressively trying to get his lips on her.
She’s having none of it.

Shams PUTS HIS HEAD OUT THROUGH THE ROOF WINDOW. He pumps
both arms in the air.
28.

SHAMS
THIS IS FREAKIN! AWESOME!

The limo stops at a red light as he’s yelling. An Asian guy,
waiting at the light in a convertible, looks back.

ASIAN DRIVER
Take it easy, kid. It’s just prom.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE

The limo pulls up to the house. There are several other
limos, and a number of cars. The house is HUGE. It sIvTs
ATOP A HILL on a large piece of land, by itself. The entire
backside is SURROUNDED BY TREES.

Zach, Brooke, Sham, and Katie finish their champagne as they
ease up the driveway.

MUSIC FADES. END OF MONTAGE.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - EVENING

There’s a swimming pool, hot tub, wooden cabana and tables
with food. Streamers, Torches and Multi-Colored Patio Lights
create the mood. Chris is mixing drinks.

Music BLARES from backyard speakers. The party is awinging.
Sasha walks past with a tray of JELLO SHOTS in her hand.
A JOINT is being passed around. It arrives at Bob.

BOB
Yeah, me and Jack - we’re taking a
year off for some serious training.
Then it's off to the NFL.
{off the blank stares)
Pro-wrestling is the back-up plan.

He passes to Moose.

MOOSE
Sometimes I think about the future.
You know, college. And... wait. I
forgot what I was gonna say.

Moose takes a second, bigger hit, and passes it to Weber.

WEBER
College is a scam to maintain the
middle-class. And the future is
fucked man, totally fucked,
29.

Weber takes a hit. He offers the joint to Val. She does a
weak inhale and pantomimes an exhale.

VAL
Yeah. Look at the colors. I am so
wasted.

Weber rolls his eyes. He walks off, and passes the joint to
ASHLEY [token slut.] She takes a huge hit, and hands it to
JIMMY, a true pothead. Ashley joins Sasha.

ASHLEY
(to Weber, re: Val) )
Who the hell did you come with?

WEBER
Not with her.
(on second thought)
What do you care, skank?

She flips him off and they part ways. BACK to Jimmy. He
inhales, savors thoughtfully, and exhales.

JIMMY
Man, who rolled this joint? It’s
amateur hour.

He lubricates it with his mouth then takes another deep hit.
He walks to a GROUP standing a few feet away, tapas a guy on
the shoulder. He turns around. It’s.. » ZACH, with Shams,
Katie, and Brooke.

ZACH
‘Urammim. «s+

He looks to Brooke for confirmation. Zach is out of his
element, he’d be game but... she shakes her head.

ZACH (CONT’D)
No thanks. Maybe later.

KATIE
None for me. The prom committee
would kill me, can you imagine?
(eager)
Have you seen Chris?

JIMMY
No. Wait, actually yes.
(thinks, very high)
Who's “Chris?”

SHAMS
I’l1l take that, thanks.

Shame takes a puff, smiles, and then looks to the crowd.
30,

SHAMS
Does anybody want a hit?

Heads turn. Lots of hands go up. A small group begins to
FORM AROUND THE JOINT, including:

SASHA
Where the hell is Natasha?

BOB
(anxiously)
And where the hell is Jack?
EXT. NATASHA’S HOUSE - EVENING

Natasha pouts in a bench on her front porch, miserable. Her
dress is rumpled. Her FATHER sits quietly beside her.

NATASHA
I can’t believe that football
obsessed retard stood me up.

NATASHA’S DAD
I’m so sorry, sweetie.

NATASHA
Thanks, pop. It’s just... it’s
Prom, you know? PROM.
She starts to CRY, wipes a finger beneath her nose.

NATASHA’S DAD
I never liked him.

The dad holds her tight. Suddenly a SCREAM.

Alarmed, they RUSH towards the source - into the backyard.
Natasha’s MOM is frozen in SHOCK, staring into the bushes.
The family TERRIER is licking blood from JACK’S UPTURNED
PALMS! Jack’s body is horrifically contorted.

NATASHA’S DAD
NO, Baxter!

The dog YELPS. Natasha shields her face and turns away.
Jack MOVES. They all JUMP. He weakly mouths “HELP.”

NATASHA’S DAD
Dee, get an ambulance!

Natasha’s mom runs inside. Natasha’s dad notices the tux,
sees the fallen backpack and gifts. He smiles Badly.
31.

NATASHA’S DAD
Help’s on the way.

INT/EXT. BOTTLING PLANT - DUSK

The building has been swarmed by Feds. A dozen Black sUvs
and white vans are parked outside.

Inside, INFECTED WORKERS have been herded into the breakroom.
They pound against the locked doors. Intermittent SCREAMS
and MOANS pierce the walls. It’s haunting.

Officers part to make way for AGENT RIDGE [tall,
intimidating, a man of very, very few words.] He approaches
the MALE RANGER.

MALE RANGER
(towards the breakroom)
They’re all gonna die?

AGENT RIDGE
cDc is en route.

MALE RANGER
The CDC -- it won’t be... like that
guy in the stream?

Agent Ridge ignores him, turning his attention to Winston,
whom he sizes up with a single up-down glance. He doesn’t
like what he sees.

WINSTON
Deputy Winston, Bunyon County.

Sidelong glances and WHISPERS ripple through the room.

AGENT RIDGE

Bunyon County?

(intrigued)
An infected patient disappeared
from your hospital? In the woods,
folks burned in an open bonfire?
We‘ve just started looking into it,
but what a shitstorm.

Winston can only stare back at him. His mouth opens to
protest, then closes, A Junior Agent rushes in:

JUNIOR AGENT 1
Ridge! We picked up a report from
Mt. Vernon, 30 miles East. The
water truck was located at a diner.
The driver was DOA.

JUNIOR AGENT 2
And an ambulance just picked up a
kid, same town, different area.
(MORE )
32.

JUNIOR AGENT 2 (cont'd)
They’re reporting infection -
“unknown pathogen.”

AGENT RIDGE
(to Junior Agents)
You know what to do.
(to Winston)
Let’s roll, “Deputy.”

INT. CHRIS‘ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - EVENING

Chris carries bottles of wine across his elegant living room.
Bob, with a beer cup in his hand and his tuxedo shirt totally
unbuttoned, is looking at a fine African statue. He touches

it, fondling the wood.

CHRIS
You break it, you buy it.

BOB
(defensive)
I’m not doing anything.
(as if this explains)
Ashley is totally ticked at me. T
think it’s gonna be World War III.

CHRIS
Prom wouldn’t be prom without at
least one.

Bob shrugs. Who cares. Chris sets the wine at the bar and
surveys the digs. Joints are going around. Everybody has a
cup. The music is up. The party is a tremendous success.

Zach and Brooke are sharing a deck chair, Zach is slowly
coming out of his shell. A tray of jello shots passes and
they each snag one.

ZACH
You just eat it?

BROOKE
(mouth full of Jello)
Yeah!

Zach does the same. BEAT. The moment is pregnant with a
potential kiss. Brooke, shyly leans a bit closer... just as:

Moose and CINDY, his (enormous) date, JUMP INTO THE POOL,
ruining the moment.

MOOSE
Fuck all ya’1llt!! cCannonballtt!!

The resulting tidal wave drenches the patio. Revelers GROAN.
33.

One splash falls on some shoes, we rise up to see Katie's
back. Her sore is now visible around the base of her neck.
Nobody hae noticed, including Shams, talking to (at) her.

SHAMS

So, long story long, I was accepted
to all three schools, but Columbia
has the best program. After living
in this shitpit so long, I really
think I’m more of a city guy...

(sees she’s not listening)
Hello?

KATIE
I feel weird. I think I’m...
(with realization)
Drunk?

SHAMS
(un-smooth)
Oh - You want to... maybe we can
find an empty room inside?

Disgusted, Katie grabs ANOTHER glass of champagne and stands
abruptly. She covers her mouth to stifle a rasping COUGH.

KATIE
I’ll be right back.

Poor Shams is abandoned. Katie smiles as she passes people,
mingling in her stupor.

KATIE
Hi guys. Anybody seen Chris?

She keeps walking. We check out the whole party from her
wobbly point of view. she looks over at Weber.

KATIE
Sugarpants! Wait, you’re not Chris.

We begin to see conversations as Katie does, in an audibly
blurred SLOW MOTION.

ASHLEY IN SLOW-MO
If you see Bob, hide me--

Katie teeters, the people around her lose focus. Her feet
gives way. She grabs Bob on her way down and hangs on.

BOB
Whoa! Careful there.

KATIE
I fell.

Bob helps her get her footing. He sees the sore on her neck.
34.

BOB
Katie, what’s that?

KATIE
What’s what?

Bob points. She tries to glance over her own shoulder to see
her neck - which of course is impossible.

KATIE
It sort of hurts.
(touching it)
Ouch. What is it?

She’s attracting attention. Then... CRUNCH! Katie loses
her balance. The STILETTO HEEL on her right foot SNAPS in
half. Her ankle twists and she FALLS.

Her ELBOW hits the ground first. IT CRUSHES INTO THE CEMENT.
CRAAACKKKKKK!!! It opens on impact and the bones snap Like
celery, blood flying in the air. Feet jump to avoid it.

BOB
Holy crap!

SASHA
(incredibly repulsed)
What the hell, Katie!

Katie tries to get up. She desperately scans for help, and
finally SPOTS CHRIS. Her dress has ripped. The sore on her
back is EXPOSED. EVERYBODY BACKS AWAY.

KATIE
Chris! Please, help me.

CHRIS
Katie. Don’t move.

KATIE
Come here.

Katie keeps moving, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO GRAB HOLD OF. As
Katie gets up, she hears CLICKING from her legs.

COUGH! Blood flies - it cannons towards Bob. He’s able to
dodge out of the way.

BOB
Jesus!

CHRIS
Take it easy! Stop moving!

Zach and Brook arrive. As does Shams. Katie's staggering
around like a zombie and getting uncomfortably close. There
is bedlam as people scurry away from her.
35.

KATIE
It hurts... Help.

VAL
I’ll call 911!

Val backs into a corner and starts talking into her phone.
Chris retreats INTO THE HOUSE. He’s followed by others.

KATIE
Chris! Where are you going?

Katie moves towards Jimmy. He too scurries inside. Zach
and Brooke hold on to each other.

BROOKE
What’s wrong with her?

Moose and Cindy RACE TO THE HOUSE. Then Shams and Ashley.
Bob... Weber... they’re all abandoning her.

KATIE
Wait!

She‘s still coughing... just missing their backs.

Jimmy begins to SHUT THE SLIDING DOORS. Zach and Brooke race
through. Katie is almost to the door...

KATIE
DON’T LEAVE ME---

Jimmy SLAMS it SHUT, right in her face. Katie BANGS on the
glass. People inside CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING.
Katie’s arm is hanging off the bone. Blood is all over her.
She looks pleadingly at Chris. He’s scared.

CBRIS
Back Away, Katie! You're getting
shit everywhere!

KATIE
Don’t look at me like that Chris!

Katie scans the patio. Some kids are on the far side of the
pool, frozen. The rest are inside. She’s all alone.

VAL
{to Katie)
An ambulance is coming, Katie!

SHAMS
You hear that? Help is on the way--

Katie erupts into a tantrum.
36.

KATIE (CONT’D)
HELP ME! HELP MBE!

ZACH
(tormented, quietly)
This isn’t right.

Katie stamps her foot as she pleads, HARD. STAMP. STAMP. on
the next one, KABOOM! Her knee explodes, spraying bits of
blood and pulp all over the glass door.

Katie SCREAMS, hopping on her remaining leg. Brooke holds
her hand over her mouth, choking back vomit. Some girls cry.

KATIE
I NEED A TOWEL!

Katie topples and her body starts to roll. She moans as she
heads towards the pool.

SPLASH! Katie hits the water. Everyone stares, frozen, as
she sinks to the bottom.

ZACH
Somebody help her!

No one moves. Zach slides back the door and steps outside.

BROOKE
Be careful.

Zach grabs the POOL STRAINER from its hook. Curious, Chris
silently emerges. In clusters, everyone trails behind — the
herd following its leader. Zach dips the pole into the
water, angling it towards Katie.

SASHA
Don’t you touch her, Chris.

CHRIS
Not a fucking chance.

SHAMS
She's still alive...

ZACH
Grab it if you can, Katie! I/11
pull you out...!

The spectators jostle closer for a better view. Katie
wiggles, looks up at Zach, then HER EYES CLOSE. There is
silence. Katie’s blood fills the once blue water,

CINDY
(defensive, panicked)
We couldn’t do anything. We didn’t
know what to do.
37.

CHRIS
We’re all witnesses.

A CHIME. Wendy, the girl from the locker room, has finally
arrived with FOUR FRIENDS, each holding bottles of liquor.

WENDY
Hey y'all: Party, Party!
(beat)
What’s everybody staring at!

Wendy’s friends stop, shocked by the gruesome scene: Blood on
the house, Blood on the cement, Dead girl in the pool. Wendy
marches on, oblivious... then SLIPS in a puddle of Katie goo.

Her arms cartwheel for balance. SPLOOSH. She lands in the
pool and surfaces immediately with one of KATIE’S ARMS —
splashing frantically. She’s hysterical.

WENDY
What the fuck! What the FUCK!

Without a word, her four friends spin on their heels and
leave. CHIMES on the gate tinkle behind them.

INT/EXI. SUV, CONVOY - NIGHT
The CONVOY of Federal SUVS speeds through the night.

Winston rides with Ridge, and is sandwiched between two
AGENTS built like linebackers. He looks like a child.

WINSTON
You know, you can let me off
anywhere.

Agent Ridge grins silently.

WINSTON (CONT’D)
Near a Burger King would be good,
but I’m open.
(off continued silence)
What do you want from me?

AGENT RIDGE
You’re a link to the source of the
epidemic. I may have... questions.

WINSTON
Questions? You never even talk.
And I’m not a link to anything. I
got no idea what you’re--

Agent Ridge reaches into his jacket and retrieves two earbud
headphones. He places them, drowning out Winston’s voice to
the very faint MUSIC of Grand Funk Railroad.
38.

WINSTON (CONT'D)
Dude, not only is that rude, but
you got shitty taste in tunes.

INT. SCOTT’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Scott and Eric pause the game to refresh themselves with
Gatorade and beef jerky. They’re laughing, having a ball.
They remove their headsets and wipe their sweaty palms.

SCOTT
You totally wailed on that last
tactical assault.

ERIC
Yeah...
(beat)
Dude, are we losers?

scott
(shocked, the craziest
thing he’s ever heard)
What?

ERIC
It’s prom night and we’re playing xX
Box online with 12 year olds.

scott
(thinks)
I’m sure the party is hella lame.

BRIC
Yeah. Just a bunch of drunk
assholes staring at one another.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The kids are in the living room - indeed, a bunch of drunk
assholes staring at one another.

Some are slumped on couches. The girls have their purses,
itching to leave... but waiting to see how things play out.

Wendy is in the kitchen, naked beneath several towels,
MUMBLING to herself. No one is going anywhere near her.

Chris is frantically hiding all evidence of underage drinking
and drug use. Sasha talks on her cell.

CHRIS
(to everyone and no one)
Feel free to help out you shits.
“Don’t mind me and the five hundred
bottles of hootch, Officer.”
39.

SASHA
(into phone)
No, I’m not dis-inviting you... Yes
you’re cool enough for me. The
party is really cancelled.

She flips her phone closed. Brooke stands to the side. she
dials her own cell, listens.

BROOKE’S DAD [VOICE]
Hi, you’ve reached the Brannigans.
Please leave us a message. Thanks.

Brooke doesn’t know what to say, and hangs up the phone.
Zach soothingly rubs her back.

A GROUP approach the front door. Chris INTERCEPTS, locks it.

CHRIS
Where the hell are you guys going?

GIRL
Um... is there a reason to stay?

CHRIS
Yes! ME. This isn’t MY problem.
This is OUR problem.
(noticing with SHOCK that
Sasha is among them)
Sash? What the FUCK?

SASHA
c’mon, Chris. If I miss prom I’m
gonna kill myself. I can meet you
there--

ZACH (0.S.)
No. We‘ll stick around. It’s the
right thing to do.

Zach is flanked supportively by Shams and Brooke. All
around, people nod grimly - reluctantly agreeing with the
sentiment. Nearby, ASHLEY confers with Jimmy and Moose.

ASHLEY
Who’s gonna tell Katie’s parents?

JIMMY
The cops take care of that.
They’11 take care of everything.
MOOSE
I thought you hated cops.

JIMMY
Yeah, well...
40.
Over to Chris and Weber, still standing near the front door.
They look out at the swimming pool.

CHRIS
My dad’s gonna freak.

Weber feels the door RATTLE against his back.

DOUG [OFF]
It’s Doug. Open up!
WEBER
Dude, you don’t want any part of
Bese
DOUG [OFF]

Let me in, or I'll break your toes.

Weber shrugs and unhooks the deadbolt. Doug and Tyler cruise
in. Despite their tuxes, they still look like gorillas.
Tyler, as usual, doesn’t say a word.

DOUG
(seeing Chris)
Bad news, Captain. No Nitrous...
(re: the melancholy)
Damn. Who fucking died?

He bursts out laughing. He’s the only one.

VAL (0.S.}
They’re here!

Two police cruisers quietly roll in. The kids all get up.
Some fix their clothes, still plotting their escape.

The COPS exit their cars. One is OFFICER PAUL [in charge,
earnest.] Val leans out the front door and calls to them.

VAL
She’s around back!

Officer Paul and another OFFICER move around to the back.
The other two stay in front.

OFFICER PAUL
Please stay inside.

Val moves inside and closes the door, All the kids move to
the patio door - still covered in blood.

Doug PUNCHES Weber, distraught.

WEBER
What the hell?
41.

DOUG
That’s for letting me in!

They watch the cops cross the patio. Bob slides open the
door and walks out. Zach, Brooke and Ashley follow him.

BOB
She fell in the pool.

BROOKE
It wasn’t our fault.

OFFICER 2
Just step back and close the door.

Officer Paul inserts his radio earpiece as he looks at the
bloody pavement and the body in the pool.

OFFICER PAUL
(into his walkie)
Looks like-- what happened to the
other kid. Yes, we’ do that.

OFFICER 1
Get back.

SASHA
We didn’t do anything!

OFFICER PAUL
Did anybody leave the premises?

2ACH
Please tell us what’s going on.

CHRIS
Yeah! It‘s my house!

OFFICER PAUL
Son, stay back. I need to know--

DOUG
(cause he’s a macho dick)
This is bullshit. I’m taking off.

officer Paul draws his gun. The other officers follow suit.
STARTLED the kids back up.

OFFICER PAUL
DID ANYBODY LEAVE?

CHRIS
(trembling)
No. No one’s left.

OFFICER PAUL
Good. Get in the house Now.
42.

JIMMY
I knew I hated cops, man.

The kids look at the guns, freaked. They shut themselves in.
The front is being watched by the two other officers.

The sound of multiple ENGINES. A white van pulls up,
followed by several black sUVs. The calvary has arrived!

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Panic is rampant. MURMURS percolate - the kids collectively
kick themselves for not bailing when they had a chance.

CHRIS
(losing his cool)
What the hell’s going on, man?
They can’t fucking do this!

VAL
(to Weber)
I’m scared, will you hold me?

JIMMY
I’m so high right now. Is this
serious, or am I just freaking out?

Brooke looks to Zach. He puts his arm around her.

SASHA
God I wish I was at Prom.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Agent Ridge exits his SUV, Winston is about to follow. Ridge
points as one might to a pet: “STAY.”

WINSTON
No way! I ain’t no dog!

Ridge shrugs, then SLAMS the door on Winston and turns to
address his MEN.

WINSTON (0.S.)
(muffled)
Dick!
(trying the door)
Let me out!

AGENT RIDGE (CONT’D)
Full perimeter. Phone and cellular
service jammed. Now.
43.

His men SCURRY. In the BG, others are barricading the
driveway, searching the yard, and ERECTING LIGHT TOWERS
AROUND THE PROPERTY.

Officer Paul approaches, and extends hia hand. Ridge shakes
it... after a moments hesitation.

OFFICER PAUL
They’re inside. I got men, front
and back. Real mess by the pool,
(looking, confused)
Isn’t there a Medical team?

AGENT RIDGE
The EMT that treated the kid across
town is already showing symptoms.

OFFICER PAUL
Jesus.

AGENT RIDGE
We wait for the CDC to arrive.

OFFICER PAUL
I gotta tell you, it was hard
pulling my weapon. These kids;
it’s still a small town --

Officer Paul‘’s eyes shift as several AGENTS carrying high-
powered RIFLES walk past.

AGENT RIDGE
Perhaps its best if you leave.

officer Paul smirks. These men are not likely to get along.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Zach is on his cellphone, talking with his parents.

ZACH
Hey Mom... actually things aren’t
go great... I know you’re
surprised to hear from me...

Zach pauses. He really can’t think of anything to be gained
by getting his poor parents all worked up just yet.

ZACH (CONT’D)
You know what, everything is fine.
My nerves just got the better of
me. You know how shy I am.

A series of loud KNOCKS on the bathroom door.
a4.

ASHLEY (OFF)
I need in! Seriously!

ZACH
(into phone)
I will, I promise...
(attempting cheer)
Don’t wait up. Hello? Hello?

The cell has no service. Zach looks at himself in the
mirror, starting to cry.

ASHLEY (OFF)
(pounding)
I’ll pee in the hall, swear to God!

ZACH
(weakly)
We’1l get through this.
(beat, more confident)
We’1l get through this.

He chokes back the tears, wipes all expression from his face.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Zach emerges from the bathroom, looking surprisingly
collected. At the end of the hall, Doug has cornered Brooke
and is practically salivating over her.

DOUG
How come we don’t know each other?
BROOKE
Different schedules, different
friends...
(beat)

Different species.

DOUG
That’s not very nice.

Zach approaches, steel in his eyes.

ZACH

(to Brooke)
Cc’mon.

DOUG

(to Brooke, pushing Zach)
You take orders from this midget?

BROOKE
Sure,

This fans Doug’s flames. He pushes Zach again, harder. Zach
simmers with RAGE.
45.

ZACH
This isn’t the lunchroom, Doug.
Don’t waste precious time--

DOUG
What’re you gonna do...?

POP! Zach’s fist collides with Doug’s skull with surprising
ferocity. Doug’s head whips around, and he SLAMS into the
wall. He stares at Zach; stunned, immobile.

VAL (OFF)
Everybody! COME QUICK!

zach and Brooke link arms and head towards Val’s voice.

ZACH
I think they cut our phone service.

BROOKE
Yeah.
(whispering, re: Doug)
What’s his problem?

ZACH
He’s pathologically averse to smart
people. He’s hated me since
kindergarten.

BROOKE
I see,
(beat)
I’m sure hitting him helped.

ZACH
I know. But it felt great.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone is gathered around the television, staring wide-eyed
at a SPECIAL REPORT.

VAL
It’s on TV! Quiet everybody!

More kids ease in, take seats or lean against the walls.
Wendy, lost in dementia, is on the far side of the room.

NEWSCASTER (TV)
We interrupt previously scheduled
programming with this bulletin...

WENDY (0.8.)
I don’t want to watch this!

Heads turn to SSSSSHHHH her.
46.

NEWSCASTER (TV)

News of a potential biological
outbreak began here, at Last Stop
Diner, after a delivery driver died
from reported massive blood
hemorrhaging.

ON TELEVISION: SHOTS of the Diner. POLICE CARS WITH FLASHING
LIGHTS surround it. Cops exit their cars with guns drawn.

DINER COP (TV)
EVERYBODY IN! EVERYBODY!

Patrons and employees are bullied into the diner. Police
keep their distance... just point their guns.

DINER COP 2 (TV)
(to Camera)
Turn the Camera off! Now!

ZACH
My God.

NEWSCASTER (TV)
Though they confirm the quarantine
of the diner, authorities have

still declined official statement.

The faces of the kids watching are dark, twitchy.

NEWSCASTER (TV)
We’ve also received word of a
separate incident. As of yet, it’s
relationship is unconfirmed.
However, exclusive testimony
indicates that this victim has also
been quarantined.

ON TELEVISION: SHOTS of Natasha’s house.

NATASHA’S DAD (TV)
Jack - I mean, he was a strong kid.
I’d never seen anything like it.
(choking up)
The fact that my daughter had to
see it-- Jesus.
(listens to reporter)
I just dropped her at the school
dance. She couldn’t be dissuaded.
(breaking down)
She’s such a trooper...

ASHLEY
Ohmygod.
BOB
(overcome)

Jack? Jack! No, no, no...!
47.

SASHA
That bitch went to prom!?

ON TELEVISION: Baxter the hyper-aggressive terrier ATTACKS
the CAMERAMAN. As the camera TILTS down we SEF that the
mongrel HAS OBVIOUS SIGNS OF INFECTION.

NATASHA’S DAD (TV)
No, Baxter! Bad dog!

NEWSCASTER (TV)
Residents are advised to stay in
their homes--

WENDY
(SCREAMS)
I DON’T WANT TO WATCH THIS!!!

From seemingly nowhere, a VASE flies into the television
screen. The screen SHATTERS in a explosion of SPARKS.

Everyone stares at the gaping whole in the TV. Wendy just
stands there, chillingly serene.

WENDY
Please change the channel?

CHRIS
You crazy bitch!

Chris drops to the floor. He starts sweeping up the debris,
lost in OCD. TENSION in the room is electric.

JIMMY
(standing)
That’s it. I’m outta here.

VAL
You heard the cops - you saw the TV
- we’re supposed to stay put!

JIMMY
Until what?! When?! We all come
down with this thing? No fucking
thanks. I’m take my chances.

He approaches the sliding glass doors, hesitates, then opens
them and steps outside.
EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, PATIO - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy walks several feet. Nothing. No cops. No problems.
He picks up the pace...

The CRACKLE of a surge of electricity. The entire house is
SUDDENLY bathed in BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT.
48.

Jimmy shields his eyes, but SEES that enormous industrial
work-lamps completely encircle the property. He FREEZES.

AGENT 1 (0.S.)
(through megaphone)
Return to the house. The cdc
should be here within hours. Until
then, you all need to stay inside.

Jimmy eyes the tree line on the far side of the pool. It’s
only ten yards away...

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

Ridge stands beside Officer Paul. From their vantage point,
they can see the entire property, lit like a baseball
diamond. No one could come or go without their knowledge.

AGENT 2 VOICE (WALKIE)
I have him sir.

OFFICER PAUL
Ridge, he’s likely perfectly
healthy...!

Agent Ridge shrugs, unaffected.

OFFICER PAUL
(to himself)
Go back inside, kid.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, PATIO - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy looks around. EVERYONE has gathered at the sliding
glass doors to stare. He takes another few steps.

AGENT 1 (0,8.)
(through megaphone)
Return to the house. You will be
gate there. Everything will be
ine.

Jimmy pauses. He drops his head and turns towards the house;
humiliated, defeated.

THEN, HE UNEXPECTEDLY TURNS BACK, SPRINTING like the wind
towards the tree line...

CRACK! A RIFLE SHOT slices through the air. JIMMY’S HEAD
SNAPS backward. He twists and falls into the hot tub,
floating face down.

The GROUP gathered at the sliding doors SCREAM en masse.
49.

INT. SUV - NIGHT

Winston has removed part of the interior door panel in an
ongoing attempt to escape. (The SUV, like most police
vehicles, unlocks only from the outside.) We see he’s also
removed the upholstery surrounding the sunroof.

Frustrated, Winston grabs his radio and scans the frequencies
until he hears:

VOICE 1 (RADIO)
The kid at the hospital just died.

VOICE 2 (RADIO)
Have the toxicology reports brought
here, and another sent to the cDC.

WINSTON
(into Radio)
And bring back a pizza. And some
beer.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, LIBRARY - NIGHT

A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS:

Lights illuminate an impressive home LIBRARY.

Zach’s fingers SCROLL the bindings of an ENCYCLOPEDIA set.

Medical books are pulled from shelves.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, DINING ROOM - LATER

This is the “War Room,” somber faces all around. Chris is
utterly losing his cool; becoming less and less coherent.
zach has taken charge, the “research” spread out before him.

2ACH
We’re in a stalemate until the cpc
arrives.

CHRIS
(babbling)
e..a total mess. Zoyla will never
be able to clean this on her own...

WEBER
We’re relying on info from the
folks that just blew Jimmy’s head
off?
50.

2ACH
No, on common sense. It’s all over
the news. They have to do
something.

DOUG
(re: Zach)
I’m not listening to a single thing
that shit-fuck says.

BROOKE
(to Zach)
Could anybody have it?

ZACH
Potentially.

VAL
What it is?

ZACH
Not sure, but there’s disease
called Necrotizing Fascitis. It’s
an infection of muscle tissue and
the skin. I think it’s something
like that. Only worse.

Brooke leans close to Zach. He puts his arm around her.
Doug ROLLS HIS EYES.

ZACH (CONT'D)
It’s a bacteria. The progression
can happen in just hours. You get
it like a cold, like mono.

BOB
Fuck!

MOOSE
This blows.

Shams grabs one of the books. Scans the page.

SHAMS
The latest strain kills seven out
of ten. The people who do live are
left with huge scars- lost limbs...

Shams passes one of the books around.

SHAMS (CONT’D)
There are some pictures.

The kids pass around and react to the horrible images of
mutilated bodies both pre and post-op. Lots of AMPUTEES.

VAL
Gross.
Sl.

ASHLEY
If I had those huge scars and
stuff, I don’t know if I’d want to
live. Is that shallow?

BOB
Yes. Yes it is.

ASHLEY
Shut up. God, I hate you.

ZACH
The first sign is skin
discoloration. As it spreads, it
starts to blister. I guess we kind
of know what can happen from there.

Morose silence.

DOUG
We need to figure out if anybody
else has got it.

ZACH
What we need to do is be extremely
careful--

CHRIS

(ignoring Zach)
Yeah! I don’t want sick people
hanging out in here!

DOUG
(taking charge)
Everybody, take off your clothes!
We’ll do a... nude test.
(to Brooke, grabbing his
crotch)
Wanna peek?

WEBER
Zach?

Doug’‘s gaze bores a hole into Zach. A competition for
“leadership” has arisen...

ZACH
(sighing)
I guess it’s an okay idea.

MOOSE
I‘m not taking my clothes off.

CHRIS
(to no one in particular)
Just so you know, I’m not bald down
there. I shave.
52.

Sasha looks at her “boyfriend,” completely repulsed. Shams
nods his own, private approval. Cindy touches Moose’s arm.

ZACH

Let’s just get this over with.
CINDY

Why not? For safety.
MOOSE

No fuckin’ way.
DOUG

(menacingly)

Do it. We all agree?
Everyone nods.

DOUG (CONT'D)
Moose, let’s see some fatboy titty.

Moose starts to take off his clothes: Jacket, Shirt, Socks,
Shoes, everything. Cindy picks up a long silver ladle and
uses it to check under his arms and between his legs.
Nearby, Bob is starting to SWEAT.

CINDY
He looks good.

ZACH
Okay. Weber, you’re next.

Cindy checks everybody around the table. While we DISSOLVE
through Cindy checking Weber, Kirstin, Doug... Shams READS:

SHAMS
The pain is so unbearable that the
body creates it’s own anaesthesia.
It DESTROYS IT’S OWN NERVE CELLS.

SASHA
God! Please stop reading that
shit, freakt

DOUG
(to Cindy)
Be thorough. We don’t want any
fucking mistakes.

We continue to watch Cindy check the kids. Now Zach, Brooke
and Tyler are looked at. Time is compressed with dissolves.

CINDY
Oh shit.

BROOKE
What?!
53.

CINDY
A sore.

People LEAP out of nearby chairs...they back away from BOB.
Cindy moves back as well,

BOB
What? What?

BROOKE
A black splotch. on his leg.

BOB
(jittery)
Maybe it’s a zit!

CINDY
No.

ZACH
(calmly)
Bob, just turn around and show us
your leg.

Bob shows the group the back of his thigh. There is a very
strange black splotch. Ashley GAGS.

ASHLEY
Oh my God...!

BOB
Hey everybody! Calm down!

DOUG
STAY RIGHT THERE, BOB!

Shams looks around. Everybody else has been checked.

SHAMS
I think that’s everyone.
(to offscreen)
Sorry guys...

REVEAL THAT Bob is not alone. He’s joined the ranks of other
random “Infected”: Kirsten, LARRY, and STEVE. Bob is
scared, and a bit cold.

DOUG
(pointing)
What about HER?

They follow his finger to... WENDY, still silently wrapped
in a towel, listless and forgotten. She suddenly realizes
that all eyes are upon her.

WENDY
What? What’s going on?
54.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

The house is QUIET. Kids slip shame-faced back into their
clothes. Shams and Zach confer privately in hushed tones.

SHAMS
How are things going with Brooke?

ZACH
Best first date ever.

SHAMS
This is pretty fucked up. We’re
banishing people.

ZACH
We’re isolating them to protect the
healthy.
(beat)
I guess. Shams, I need to ask you
a question.

SHAMS
Shoot.

ZACH
Have you done anything to place
yourself at risk? Share a glass, a
joint, anything - with someone we
know is infected?

SHAMS
(concentrates)
No. No, I really don’t think so.

ZACH
(slowly)
Did you kiss Katie?

Shams BLANCHES. He hadn‘t even thought of that. He keeps
his cool... Barely.

SHAMS
No. No way, man! Lucky break too,
cause man, you saw me trying...

Zach sizes him up, concerned and unconvinced.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Bob walks down a flight of stairs carrying his clothes ina
pile. He looks over his shoulder. Wendy and the OTHERS are
right behind.
55.

Doug and Chris are their escorts. Both are wearing elbow-
length yellow cleaning gloves and have white kitchen trash-
bags pulled over their torsos.

DOUG
Don’t come so close to me, okay?

Wendy just glares at him.
DOUG (CONT'D)

Keep going!
BOB
You guys can’t do this.
WENDY
I don’t have any sores! I’m okay!
I’m clean!
DOUG

Sorry sweetheart, but you fell in

the soup, 80... you’re fucked.
(grins cruelly)

We all voted.

CHRIS
(meekly)
It’s at the very end.

BOB
Please, please don’t. I’m
claustrophobic. I’m--

DOUG
Keep moving.

Bob turns and tries to force his way back up the stairs,
panicking. Doug SHOVES him. Bob wobbles precariously.

BOB
Dude, we’re friends!

DOUG
Not really.

Bob takes a defiant step up. The tension between he and Doug
crackles.

BOB
I’m going up. I won’t touch
anybody. I’m not staying down
there--

Again he tries to pass, and again Doug shoves him, but this
time - Bob loses his balance, toppling down the staircase and
landing on the basement floor with a sickening CRUNCH.
56.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Chris and Doug DRAG Bob’s heavy, unconscious body to the end
of the basement and towards A WINE CELLAR. His leg is
twisted at a right angle. There is a big stone door, with a
SMALL WINDOW in it.

Chris opens it to REVEAL a decent sized room, with rows of
neatly racked bottles. The entire cellar is stone.

WENDY
You’ll come and get us, right?
KIRSTIN
(re: Bob)

Is he... dead?
Doug slams the door.

WENDY (0.S.)
(through the door)
What are we supposed to do?

DOUG
Drink!

INT. SUV - NIGHT

Winston has dismantled the screen mesh that separates the
back and front seats. He is squeezed behind the driver’s
seat, his legs buttressed against the front windshield. He
pushes with all his might.

Nothing. He takes a quick sip from a hip flask he keeps
tucked within his jacket, and tries again.

The seal around the window FLEXES slightly.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

officer Paul stands beside Agent Ridge, still surveying the
scene from their elevated vantage point.

BELOW: Two OFFICERS in Bichazard Suits are retrieving
Jimmy’s body from the jacuzzi, and carefully sealing him in
plastic sheeting.

ON THE STREET BEYOND: several cars -- a stationwagon, a News
Van, and several sedans -- pull up to the barricades.

OFFICER PAUL
You’ve got company.
(Ridge follows his gaze)
(MORE )
57.
OFFICER PAUL (cont'd)
Parents and local media. This
should be interesting.

Ridge frowns. Officer Paul notices something else.

OFFICER PAUL
Who’s that?

BELOW: WINSTON has SHATTERED the windshield of the SUV in
which he was imprisoned, and is crawling out acrosa the hood!

Several PARENTS and a NEWS TEAM rush towards him!

AGENT RIDGE (CONT’D)
Fuck.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, STREET — NIGHT

Winston is addressing a small gathering: Sargeant Frank
(Sham’s hotheaded dad), Dr. Viola, (Doug’s dad), Zach’s Mom
and Dad and several other PARENTS.

The NEWS CREW is ROLLING camera. Winston ig wildly
disoriented, but can’t help milk being the unexpected center
of attention.

ZACH’S DAD
Do you think the kids are safe?

WINSTON
Um - looks like a killer house.

PARENT
I spoke to my daughter. She said
that kids are locked in the
basement. Sick kids--!

ZACH'S MOM
Our baby Zachary, he’s very frail--

ZACH’S DAD
On the phone, he wouldn't tell us
what was going ont

DR. VIOLA
I’m sure my son Douglas is helping
take care of everyone.

WINSTON
I’ve just arrived, but assure you —
we’re doing everything we can.

Agent Ridge approaches, flanked by Officer Paul.
58.

REPORTER
Do you know when CDC is expected?
Can you outline the plane for
treatment?

WINSTON

(noticing Ridge
Sadly, the safety of your kids is
not our only concern right now.
The man you all want to speak to is
right over there--

(pointing)
He’s the one calling the shots, and
I’m sure would love to further
explain the situation.

Led by an irate Sargeant Frank, the parents MOB Agent Ridge.
Officer Paul can’t help but smirk.

REPORTER 2
(to camera)
We continue our coverage of this
horrific chain of events. One
can’t imagine a more tragic Prom--

With everyone swept up in the melee, Winston takes the
opportunity to steal away. He pauses beside an OFFICER,
whose attention is focused on the face-off between Agent
Ridge and Sargeant Frank.

SARGEANT FRANK
You wanna take me on, Pussy?

WINSTON SLYLY UNHOOKS THE OFFICERS KEYRING FROM HIS UTILITY
BELT! Winston then slips towards the parked police cruisers.
He tries one door handle, then another. The key slips neatly
inside the third.
WINSTON

Sweet.
EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, PARKING LOT -— NIGHT
Two cop cars speed into the parking lot, Lights flashing.
The cars stop in front of the service entrance. The COPS
jump out and are led into the school by a JANITOR.
INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - FOOD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

The police look at the cases of water. They check bar code
humbers against a list they have on a clip board.

They find the six cases of bad water and see that two bottles
are missing.
59.

COP i
These are them. Only two gone.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

The PROM is in full swing. The kids are slow-dancing to the
Band‘s very bad, very strange cover of Usher’s "Do it to Me.”

A large, hand-inked banner reads: “Moonbeams and Magic”

Rapid PANS from location to location paint a familiar
picture: the dance has segregated into clear cliques. The
JOCKS, the STONERS, the GEEKS, the BRAINS, etc...

The cops slip inside, and approach a cluster of adults - the
PRINCIPAL and some CHAPERONES.

PRINCIPAL
We’ve heard the terrible news.

CHAPERONE 1
But everything is just fine here.

CHAPERONE 2
We've checked. Besides, the kids
really need this night. Especially
now-—

COP 2
(into radio)
Officer Kasperski. Prom is clear.

Nearby, a very disturbed NATASHA dances alongside the
PRETTIES, shuffling her feet like a robot.

INT. SQUAD CAR, MT. VERNON STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Winston is driving, admiring how superior the Mt. Vernon
police cruisers are to the Bunyon County crappers.

The police scanner crackles:

COP 2 [RADIO]
Kaperski here. I repeat, Prom is
all clear.

WINSTON
(into CB)
That’s great news. So... where
exactly is the high school?

COP 2 [RADIO]
(beat)
It’s right off-- who is this?
60.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy and Shams look out the window...there’s a small crack
through which they can glimpse the action outside.

SHAMS
Figures that my Dad would be
starting a fight...
(beat)
Maybe they’1l shoot him.

Everybody is drinking, sitting around the room on couches and
the floor. Ashley is bartending.

MOOSE
You know what I think? This could
be one of those tragedies that they
Make trading cards out of. There’s
gonna be a card of me like this...

Moose makes a deathly face.

CINDY
That’s not funny.

ZACH
My parents must be going nuts.

BROOKE
My mom probably had a stroke.

Val reaches for Weber’s beer.

SHAMS
Hey - no sharing. Hopefully it’s
not too late.

Doug makes the connection, and leads the Witchhunt...

DOUG
(to Moose)
You and Bob were doing gravity
chugs earlier. You fuckers used
the same funnel!

MOOSE
(re: Ashley)
Yeah - well she’s his GIRLFRIEND.

ASHLEY
We've been fighting! I didn’t lay
a finger on that asshole.
(beat)
But I saw Weber flirting with that
chick we sent to the basement!
61.

Val yelps, jealously. Weber punches Moose. Doug is about to
get involved...

ZACH
Go nuts. Have a fistfight. Get
your hands ALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.

They looks at their hands, decide it’s best to back down.

ZACH (CONT’D)
Don’t do this. We have to be
smart.

DOUG
(paranoid, defensive)
Is that a crack about me?

Tyler hits a joint, then offers it to Ashley.

ASHLEY
Are you retarded?

WEBER
We have any more weed?

MOOSE
Jimmy had it all.

A quiet moment. They all know where Jimmy ended up. Tyler
looks around. He sucks down what’s left.

CINDY
Do you guys think it’s cruel to
keep those guys in that cellar?

SASHA
Fuck em. Where’s Chris? He’s so
useless, it’s like, shocking.

CINDY
But they’re all alone...

As this discussion continues, we FIND Chris, fetishistically
cleaning the kitchen. He is useless, He takes an APPLE from
a fruit bowl, bites into it - CRACK!

Chris’s EYES WIDEN. Nobody else seemed to hear. He chews,
as he does...there is CLICKING. He wipes his mouth. A
little blood comes out... AND A TOOTH. He fights back tears.

SASHA
Chris, can we put on some tunes?
(beat)
Hellooocoo?

ASHLEY
Earth to wastoid?
62.

Chris tries to act natural, mouth full. He chews a bit,
wipes his mouth again... TWO MORE TEETH. Blood runs. He
SLURPS it back in - closes his lips AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

ASHLEY
Are you alright?

Chris’s eyes water. He tries to swallow - CLICK... POP! He
covers his mouth with his hands. A little blood leaks
between his fingers.

BROOKE
What’s wrong?

DOUG
Open your mouth!

ZACK
Go to the sink, Chris. Slowly.

Though gagging on his own blood, Chris shakes his head - NO.

DOUG
Don’t fuck around, fucker!

Chris’s eyes flood with heartbreaking desperation. He wants
to say HELP, but can’t. His body is saying it for him.

DOUG THROWS A BOOK AT CHRIS. It HITS HIM IN THE CHEST.
Chris jumps up and down. The pain inside of him is about to
buret. He can’t hold it in...he can’t...he can’t...

SASHA
Oh God Oh God Oh God Oh God...

Chris unleashes the LOUDEST CRY IN HISTORY. The squeal of a
thousand babies.

CHRIS
WAAAAAAAHE! WAAAAHH!

Blood flows out his mouth like a RIVER. His JAW is TOTALLY
UNHINGED. He SOBS and SOBS, his jaw flapping freely.

SHAMS
GET BACKIII!1

Everyone jumps. Chris catches a sight of himself in a
mirror...when he sees his image, his wails INTENSIFY.

CHRIS
WAAAHHAHHHHAHHA! WAHHHAAA!

Chris flees running down the hall, his howls diminishing with
distance. No one reaches out to stop him, they all keep
their distance.
63.

From the edges of the room, everyone who has a drink, even a
full one, CHUGS IT ALL THE WAY.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Doug, Weber, and Tyler stalk softly, following a dark trail
of blood on the carpet. Weber wields a floor mop, Tyler a
broom. The hall is uncomfortably quiet. The trail of blood
ends at a linen closet.

The boys steel themselves, “weapons” at the ready. Doug
flings the closet doors open.

It’s empty. Doug pulls an overhead cord illuminating a
single overhead lightbulb.

WEBER
Sssh. Do you hear that?

They stand still, and can indeed hear faint rasping
BREATHING. Doug runs his fingers across the shelves. Tyler
reaches out to open the lid on a large clothes hamper...

Chris EXPLODES from the hamper, and tries to force his way
past them, BELLOWING with rage and pain and fear.

Weber and Tyler beat him to the ground with their cleaning
tools. Chris screams. Doug looks sickeningly pleased,

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT - NIGHT

Chris is ushered to the Cellar. His entire torso is swaddled
with blankets and tablecloths. BLOOD still seeps through.

Doug and Weber push him from behind with a BROOM. Leading
him down the hallway.

They open the cellar door. Wendy JUMPS UP.

BOB
Time to go?

Bob sees Chris. His good mood fizzles. Everyone’s
conditions have significantly worsened. Bob’s broken leg is
covered in BUBBLING SORES. Kirsten’s cheeks have sunken,
revealing bone beneath. Oddly, WENDY STILL LOOKS HEALTHY.

WENDY
(eyeing Chris)
You can’t be serious.

Chris is put in the cellar. The door closes. Chris just
stands in the middle of the room. Then slowly, tearily -
speaks through his mangled jaw:
64.

CHRIS
Hew geeys. Wast gee-ing on?

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, GAMEROOM - LATER

The gameroom features video games, a pool table, bean bag
chairs, and a large screen TV. Shams, Brooke, and Zach have
the space all to themselves.

BROOKE
Do we have to go back up?

ZACH
I don’t see why.

BROOKE
You know Zach, passing you in the
halls - I never would have guessed
that you were so, so...

Zach is doesn’t let her finish. He leans in for the KISS.
Brooke strokes his cheek. It’s tender and sweet.

Shams eyes them, his eyes darkening with jealousy.

SHAMS
Careful. I hear there’s something
going around.

Zach and Brooke separate and smile self-consciously. Whoops!
It’s true: this first kiss has much deeper resonance than
most. JUST THEN, Weber appears at the door.

WEBER
You need to come to the kitchen.
ZACH
We‘re fine here, thanks.
WEBER
(to Zach)

Please don’t leave our fates
entirely in the hands of Pimple.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, KITCHEN ~— CONTINUOUS

Weber herds Zach, Brooke, and Shams inside. Everyone stands
in the kitchen. Doug has center stage.

DOUG
Alright. It’s “go” time.

Doug opens the freezer and takes out three ice-cube trays.
65.

ASHLEY
What is this?

DOUG (CONT’D)

An ice-cube test. And no pussy
shit. You got to bite right
through.

BROOKE
No more. I can’t take anymore.

ZACH
Doug, she‘s right. If we’re
careful, no one’s going to get
infected that isn’t already. All
we have to do is wait for the CDC.

DOUG.
I don‘t want to risk standing next
to some fucker who could start
leaking shit all over me.

ZACH
This isa sadistic.

DOUG
That guy had bad teeth. Show me
you don’t, or it’s cellar time.

BROOKE
Calm down--

DOUG
What’s wrong with you two? You got
something to hide?
(turning to the others)
Anybody else feel it’s better to
know who’s rotten?

Almost EVERYONE raises their hands. Brooke’s stays down, and
Zach reaches for it. Holds it tight.

BOUG
This all started cause that bitch
Katie had it. SHE DIDN’T TELL US,
NOW WE ALL MAY BE FUCKED. Let’s
take the littlest of precautions
okay? I’1ll go first.

Doug walks up to the sink. He takes a cube out of the tray
and holds it IN HIS TEETH... squeezes his jaw. CRACK! He
breaks the ice-cube.

SASHA
That looks painful.

DOUG
Brooke, you're up. Go,
66.

She walks slowly towards the sink. sasha helps her get a
cube out of the tray. Brooke looks back to Zach.

DOUG
Weasel-boy can’t help you. Come
on, girl!

BROOKE
I’m going!

Brooke takes a cube and puts it in her mouth. She bites hard
on it... she squeezes... harder... she quits. Zach watches,
anxiously. After all, he just kissed this girl.

BROOKE (CONT'D)
I need another try.
(to herself)
Please God, let me do this.

She bites, her eyes are tight. CRACK! The cube breaks. She
let’s the halves fall into the sink and pumps her fists.

BROOKE (CONT’D)
Yes! Yes!

DOUG
Zach? Let’s go.

Zach takes a cube and bites and holds it between his teeth.
WE SEE HIS TEETH RUBBING AGAINST THE HARD ICE... GRINDING AS
HE TRIES TO BREAK IT. He takes the cube out of his mouth.

ZACH
Dammit.

DOUG
I’ll bet you wish you were home
with your socially challenged
friends right now, huh?

SHAMS
You can do it, Zach.

Zach puts the cube back in. The GROUP looks scared for him.
Zach tries again. He squeezes. CRACK! Brooke hugs him.

Doug passes the tray to Moose. Moose leans over the sink.
He looks terrified.

MOOSE
No problem.

His jaw muscles TENSE. His cheeks REDDEN. Veins BULGE.

WEBER
Keep squeezing, buddy. Break it!
67.

Moose puts his hand on the edge of the sink for leverage.
His face contorts with strain.

SHAMS
Keep it up.

THE FLESH ON HIS FOREHEAD STARTS TO SLOWLY RIP. A DROP OF
BLOOD SLIPS OUT AS IF FROM A SHAVING CUT... CRACKI!I!I1!!

His FOREREAD SPLITS OPEN! Blood gushes. We can see the
inside of his head. He SCREAMS. He’s not alone...
SASHA
Make it STOP!
Moose clutches the sides of his head in a panic. Then as he
squeezes... WHOOSH! HIS EYE shoots OUT OF THE SOCKET!!!
SPLAT! It hits the fridge.

MOOSE
What was that!!!

Moose covers his face with his hands. He’s WAILING. He runs
tight circles in the kitchen... dropping blood everywhere...
He won’t stop moving.

MOOSE
MY FACE!!!! MY FACE!!!

He can’t see. He staggers close to the group.

WHAM! Doug konks him in the back of the head with a broom.
Moose lands hard. He moans on the floor, down for the count.

A moment of silence as everyone looks around the room.

SHAMS

That’s the grossest shit ever.
DOUG

Yeah... but the test worked.
SASHA

I’m gonna be sick.
ASHLEY

Me too.
CINDY

Me first!

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sasha, Ashley and Cindy knock into each other as they jockey
for the first place position.
68.

They’re all moments from heaving. Cindy has her hand in
front of her mouth. She looks like she has already started
to vomit a little.

Ashley takes the lead.

SASHA
NOt

Cindy pushes Ashley into the wall like a hockey check, BAM!
Cindy gets to the bathroom first. All three topple in.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS

They try to get their bearings, all over each other. They
push as they each try to pick up the toilet seat.

When the seat is half way up, Cindy hurls.

CINDY
AAAOCOOHHFFFFF!

Sasha follows, some into the toilet, most onto the wall.

SASHA
AAOOOF FFWHHOOOOOOLLLLLLLLFFFKKKFF !

Ashley is about to pop. There is no room to get to the
toilet. She looks to the sink.

ASHLEY
CCHOOOOOFFKKK. CHOOKKFOOFK. CHIKKO!

Ashley pukes all over the sink and floor... Then SHRIEKS.

She stares at her vomit. It’s BLOOD RED, and full of CHUNKS.
She heaves again - this time producing a watery FLUID more
black than red.

SASHA
(exhausted)
It really stinks in here.

She turns, notices Ashley’s “predicament.” They make eye
contact, Ashley tries to speak, but can’t stop PUKING.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR - LATER

SLAM. Doug seals Moose and Ashley inside. The cellar is
getting crowded. Behind him, Cindy is having conniptions as

separation from Moose sinks in.

DOUG
Girl, chill out.
69,

Muffled by the thick door, we hear the sound of Ashley
RETCHING again, following by GROANS of disgust.

BOB (0.8. )
Damn Ashley! Like it wasn’t fucked
enough in here already!

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Kids slow-dance beneath a spinning disco ball.

A NEWS CREW setting up on the far side of the gym. Local
reporter JILL VALENZUELA is starting to interview Prom-goers.

FIND: Natasha, fending off the hand-sy advances of another
JOCK, a virtual clone of JACK.

JOCK

JOCK
Didn‘t stop you from coming.
(beat)
Everyone gets lucky on Prom Night.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CHRIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Val and Weber are in the middle of the room, half-clothed,
climbing all over each other.

As _they remove each other’s tops, they hit the bed. val
pulls Weber on top of her.

WEBER
We shouldn’t be doing this. It’s
not... safe.

They make love in a frenetic hurry. Weber nuzzles her.

VAL
I love you. I love you.

WEBER
Oh, baby.
(eyes closing)
What’s happening to us?

VAL
Don’t talk. Just fuck me. Fuck
me. Fuck me--

He pumps as hard as he can.
70.

WEBER
OHHHHH...

VAL
Don’t cum.

Weber tenses up. He tries to hold back....

VAL (CONT’D)
Don’t....Wait....

WEBER
I’m 90.....

Weber can’t hold it. He comes.

WEBER (CONT’D)
oe eBCALEd. cae

He falls on top of her, exhausted. She holds him.
VAL
(tenderly)
You are so sweet. So sweet.
WEBER
(quietly)
You better not be sick.
He puts his face in her chest and weeps.
VAL
We‘re all gonna die anyway. Might
as well have a fucking orgy.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR — NIGHT
Bob and Moose are huddled in a corner. Kirby’s body is in
another corner. Wendy is passed out with a bottle of wine in
her hand. still bizarrely blemish free...

Ashley and Kirstin are lying down together between wine
racks. They are MAKING OUT LIKE THEIR LIVES DEPENDED ON IT.

ASHLEY
You feel soo0o good.

KIRSTIN
So do you.

Bob watches the girls, transfixed, then turns to Moose.

BOB
(to Moose)
Hey.
71.
MOOSE
Hi.
BOB
(seductively)
How's it going?

Moose shoots Bob a look. Well, as best he can with one eye.

MOOSE
Don’t.

BOB
Don’t what?

They sit for a quiet BEAT.

MOOSE
Get away from me.

Moose scoots away. Bob moves close again.

BOB
Come on. This is the end, man.
Game over.

MOOSE
Stop it!

Moose tries to get up. Bob, with his good hand, gently pulls
Moose back down.

BOB
You remember that time...at camp?
It’s okay... Who cares what these
people think anyway.

Moose looks around the room at the motley crew. His macho
attitude fades. He GRABS BOB’S FACE, They make out.

MOOSE
Oh, Bob.

BOB
Yes! Yes, Jack!

Moose pulls away. “What did you just call me?” He shrugs it
off. They remove each other’s clothes, lay down on the bench
and start to have sex.

They moan with pleasure. Ashley and Kirstin moan with
pleasure. REVEAL Chris watching it all, pleasuring himself.
72.

INT. SCOTT’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

Scott and Eric actually look a bit battle fatigued. The game
is PAUSED. The floor around them is littered with soda cans
and candy wrappers.

scott
We need more victims.

ERIC
(pointing at the screen)
Two more, coming our way!

scorT
Wait, we know that screen name.
That ’s--

ERIC
Shams!

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, GAMEROOM - NIGHT

Shams and Tyler play X-BOX on the big screen. There is a
bottle of whisky and two glasses in between them.

SHAMS
Bring it, bitches.
Game characters pummel each other with futuristic artillery.

TYLER
DIE FUCKERS! DIEt
They each take a drink.

SHAMS
You now, I don’t think I’ve ever
heard you talk before.

TYLER
Don’t have much to say.
(vet screen)
Shit! Lost my shield.

SHAMS
Turns out, playing videogames all
night would have been fine.
(tugging his collar)
Is it hot in here?

TYLER
Sorry, what?

Shams gets his game face on.
73.

SHAMS
Nothing. Just, this disease shit -
it’s pretty serious.

TYLER
Anything in life you’d do
different?
SHAMS
(beat)
I’m a virgin.
TYLER
That sucks.
SHAMS

What about you?
They continue their play.
TYLER
(re: screen)
Move! Move, move move!
(beat)
Me? I don’t know. Beat the shit
out of guys like you less often?
Tyler and Shams characters are getting DESTROYED.
TYLER (CONT'D)
Dude, these guys are good.
SHAMS
NO FUCKIN’ WAY.
Shams gets into it. His fingers hit the pads like crazy. He
squeezes as hard as he can. He watches his player onscreen
fight back. Then...

We hear CRACK! CRACK! The sound is coming from Shams’s
fingere as he wails away at the game.

TYLER
Do it!

Shams MASHES HIS PAD WITH ALL HIS MIGHT!

SHAMS
AAAHHHHHH! HALI1

A DOUBLE-CRACK! FILLS THE ROOM. THEY BOTH HEAR IT.

Tyler looks over and discovers that SHAMS THUMBS ARE MISSING.
Actually, they’re on the floor.

SHAMS
Uh oh.
 

74.

TYLER
THE FUCKI!II...

Tyler BELLOWS. Shams however, is remarkably calm. No
screaming. Just devastating disappointment.

TYLER
HELP! HELP! HELP!

SHAMS
Can’t I catch a break?

Shams tries to pick up his thumbs - an ironically difficult
task without them attached to his hand.

KIDS fill the doorway - Val, Zach, Brooke and the others
behind them.

Zach takes in the sight, heart-~broken.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR - NIGHT

Zach and shams confer on opposite sides of the thick door.
Guilt and sadness wrestle across Zach’s face.

SPLITSCREEN:

SHAMS
Please. Please, Zach - I’m begging
you. Don’t leave me in here.

ZACH
I’m so sorry.

SHAMS
There‘’s got to be something you can
do. You’re a bright guy.

ZACH
Just hang in there. Help is on the
way. You’ve just got to hang on.

SHAMS
Fuck you! They’re gonna let us rot
and you KNOW IT! Think!
There’s a long beat.

ZACH
I don’t know what to do, Shams.

He stands. Wipes tears from his eyes and starts down the
long, narrow hallway.

SHAMS (0.S.)
Don’t leave me Zach! Zach!

 
7S.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zach, Brooke, Sasha, and Doug are flipping channels in the
guest bedroom. FLICK. An informercial for "Salad Shooter.”
FLICK. An old episode of “Facts of Life.” FLICK-—-

They all stare listlessly. Zach strokes Brooke’s hair.

BROOKE
I wonder what my sister’s gonna be
like when she grows up.

ZACH
You’ll get to see. Promise.

SASHA
You can’t promise. You don’t know.

CLOSE ON: Doug, sweating profusely. His eyes are red, his
breath a bit labored. He scoots closer to Sasha.

SASHA
Don’t even think about it.

DOUG
(sudden outburst)
Fuck! I need to FUCKING GET THE
FUCK OUT OF THIS FUCKING PLACE!

They all STARE at him, stunned despite themselves.

DOUG
What? Fuck you guys.

He stumbles towards the bathroom. Zach is concerned.
ZACH
He’s... off.
(beat)
More so than usual.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
CLOSE ON: Doug, who does indeed Look pretty damn crazy.

Doug DISCOVERS that the walls, toilet and floor are plastered
with puke.

DOUG
Pigs.

He struggles with his zipper and PEES into the shower. He
runs a free hand through his hair... then looks at his
fingers. He sees blood.
76.

He ZIPS up, then looks in the mirror. He SPREADS HIS HAIR
apart - sees a BLOODY SORE that extends behind his ear. He
tugs the top of his ear for closer inspection... and it comes
CLEAN OFF HIS HEAD.

DOUG (CONT’D)
No FUCKING way.

He carefully tries to STICK the ear back on. It stays -
secured by gooey layer of puss.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BEDROOM ~ NIGHT

Doug reappears in the doorway looking worse and frighteningly
vacant. He’s completely snapped... or is about to.

No one on the bed notices. Their eyes are glued to the NEWS:

JUDITH MARTIN (TV)
++-Jill Valenzuela spoke with some
of the students. Here’s the tape.

The news CUTS TO footage of JILL VALENZUELA, a peppy
reporter, interviewing kids AT THE PROM. She passes two kids
SLOW DANCING.

JILL VALENZUELA
What do you two think of the
tragedy?

DANCING GIRL (TV)
It’s a shame.

JILL VALENZUELA (TV)
How about you?

DANCING GUY (TV)
Yeah. Total bummer.

They two kids go back to slow dancing. We SEE that Natasha
ig miraculously recovered from her trauma. she’s in the arms
of a new BEAU.

Jill walks over to three girls, MARYANN MCDONOUGH, a girl
with way too much attitude, JANINE, and TRACI, a petite girl
who speaks softly.

SASHA
(to Doug)
Hey ~ weren’t you going to Prom
with MaryAnn?

DOUG
(stonefaced)
I blew her off. Came her instead.
77.

BROOKE
Lucky break for both of you.

JILL VALENZUELA (Tv)
Did you guys know the kids at Chris
Welch’s house?

Janine leans into the microphone.

JANINE (TV)
I did. It’s so tragic you know.
They were so young.

Sasha starts to CRY. Zach and Brooke turn to one another.

BROOKE
Were?
SASHA
(sobbing, gasping)

Oh my God. Prom! Look... How...
Beautiful...

Jill Valenzuela turns to MARYANN MCDONOUGH. Doug’s jaw
CLENCHES,.

BROOKE
Look Doug. Your sweetie.

JILL VALENZUELA (TV)
I understand this evening is
particularly hard for you. Your
date is trapped in that house--

MARY ANN (TV)
Hi, I’m MaryAnn. Let me first just
say that I feel really bad for all
of them. And I did feel really bad
about Doug, too - I mean, I still
do but-- sometimes he was such a
jerk. If he’d just come directly
to Prom like I asked...

DOUG
Fuck you, MaryAnn.

Traci pushes past MaryAnn and looks in the camera.

TRACY (TV)
Yeah. I want to send all my wishes
and prayers. But it’s true... Doug
wasn’t very nice.

JANINE (TV)
Yeah. He was so conceited.

DOUG.
SHUT UP!
78.

JILL VALENZUELA (TV)
Our hearts are with these kids -
struggling to enjoy their Bpecial
night under these awful
circumstances.

Doug THROWS A GLASS at the screen, and the 2nd TV of the
evening is OBLITERATED.

SASHA
Dammit! That’s the last TV!

Doug is SHAKING with rage. He looks like a volcano.

DOUG
Wish those fucking bitches were
heret

BROOKE

Dude, settle.

DOUG
Fucking all you fuckers are fucked!

SUDDENLY: Doug’s EAR FALLS OFF. No one moves.

DOUG
Fuck.

Doug RUSHES for the window, throws it open. The RED LASER
DOT from a rifle sight traces it’s way up his torso.

Douc
FUCKII!!

He takes off down the hall.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, DINING ROOM - LATER

Zach addresses the gathered troops. They hang on his every
word ~ he’s emerged as the clear leader.

ZACH
Alright everybody. We looked, but
there’s no sign of him.

Alarmed WHISPERS spread through the group.

TYLER
He’s in here somewhere.
(beat)
I could take him.

ZACH
He’s... a little nuts and hasn’t
got anything to lose.

(MORE)
79.
ZACH (cont'd)
That makes him much more dangerous.
We need to watch each other’s
backs.

Weber raises his hand. Zach POINTS.

WEBER
Watch our backs? We’re SCREWED. I
mean, if the CDC doesn’t arrive
goon, and now with a psycho running
around--~

ZACH (CONT'D)
They’1l come. This has become far
too big.

(darkly)
But yes, for some of us the clock
is ticking. We can’t stand by and
do nothing while our friends die.

Everyone looks down ~ towards the BASEMENT.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

BAM! The cellar door flies open. It’s Zach and Brook, with
a small set of curious bystanders. Moose Bob, and several
others are in pretty bad shape. Wendy is STILL blemish free.
Zach looks ready for war.

Shams eyes him gratefully, optimistically.

SHAMS:
Zach?

2ACH
Hey there, buddy.

WENDY
I’m not sick! I swear, I’m not!

ZACH
There’s a chance you’re immune.
I’m sorry that this happened to
you, but you might be valuable to
the CDC. Thank you for being so
brave.

Wendy calms immediately. Zach turns towards Chris:

2ACH
Chris -

CHRIS (0.S.)
(mangled jaw)
Yeag - Warz sup?

ZACH
I need power tools.
80.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT HALLWAY - LATER

We follow a long extension cord. It runs down the hallway,
past kids’ feet, and underneath the cellar door. Zach and
Chris watch through the window. Cindy paces behind them.

SASHA
I can’t watch.

She looks at Brooke expectantly.

BROOKE
I’m staying.

Sasha storms upstairs. Doug peek through the window.
SASHA (0.S.)

Crazy mother-fuckers....
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR — NIGHT
An impromptu MEDICAL STATION has been built. There are boxes
of bandages, scissors, twine, paper towels, a tube of
antibacterial ointment, and TWO BOTTLES OF VODKA.
Zach holds a CIRCULAR SAW.

Sheets have been laid down on the floor. Shams is laid out
on top of them.

SHAMS
(eying the circular saw)
That’s a far cry from a scalpel.

Zach waves Bob over. ZACH AND BOB throw SHEETS OVER THEIR
HEADS. Eye holes have been cut out. THEY LOOK LIKE GHOSTS.

Bob puts his foot on Shams’ wrist. HE HOLDS IT DOWN.

Zach puts Safety Goggles on. He lines up the blade on SHAMS’
FOREARM.

SHAMS
You have to take off that much?

Zach indicates where the discolored veins in the hand end and
healthy flesh begins.

ZACH
There’ s no point if we don’t get it

SHAMS
(lightly)
Yeah, what’s an extra inch or two--
81.

2ACH
Shams - you sure you’re cool?

Shams nods and Zach squeezes the trigger. RRRRRRRRRR!
BLOOD FLIES EVERYWHERE! WINE RACKS GET SPLATTERED.

SHAMS
AAAAAAAAHHHE I

PIECES OF BONE chip away and sail in the air. ZACH GRIMACES
WITH STEADFAST DETERMINATION.

Then, it’s time for Shams other wrist - and the left hand is
severed as messily as the right.

The sick kids are huddled in a corner, facing away, blood all
over their backs. The saw WHINES to a slow stop.

Brooke administers rapid medical attention... bandages,
vodka, the works,

2ACH
(raising his goggles)
Who’s next?

TO BLACK:
The grinding WHIR OF THE POWER SAW OVER:

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, STREET - CONTINUOUS

The scene outside has become more melee than managed police
scene. Parents are swarming. News crews have literally set
up camp. Even a PROTEST GROUP has made an appearance...

Agent Ridge has detained several parents; Sargeant Frank is
being led away in cuffs, YELLING at the top of his lungs.

A REPORTER and CAMERAMAN corner Agent Ridge.

REPORTER
We understand that an entire small
town in Bunyon County has undergone
similar containment.

The reporter thrusts the microphone in Ridge’s face and lets
it hover there. He doesn’t say a word.

REPORTER
Any comment on the situation inside
the house?

Ridge reaches over and plucks a cable from the side of the
camera. The small light glowing on top dims. The cameraman
CURSES and Ridge walks away, soon joined by a JUNIOR AGENT.
82.

JUNIOR AGENT
No sign of him sir. The cruiser he
stole is still MIA too...

NEARBY: Officer Paul is conversing with Zach's parents and
Doug’s dad Dr. Viola.

OFFICER PAUL
This is total chaos.

ZACH’S DAD
Is there anything we can do?

OFFICER PAUL
Pray.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Winston is driving, utterly preoccupied with the array of
fancy doodads on the dash: GPS, call monitors, data
computer... he punches buttons arbitrarily.

The radio crackles:

VOICE (RADIO)
Deputy Winston. You’re ordered to
respond. Return the vehicle.

WINSTON
(to himself)
¥’all can clean your own mess.

WHAM! The cruiser CRASHES into an electrical pole. Two high-
tension power lines fall to the asphalt, writhing like live
snakes. Winston hurries from the car to survey the damage.

WINSTON
Whoops.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, STREET - CONTINUOUS
There’s a loud electrical SNAP, then a strange deep, droning
noise - like the world’s largest television set being turned
off ~ BEEEEEEEEQOOOOOOOOOOP.
The entire BLOCK is plunged into darkness. Every streetlamp,
every home, every traffic light... INCLUDING THE SECURITY
LIGHTS WHICH SURROUND CHRIS’ HOUSE.
INT. SCOTT’S BASEMENT, DARK - CONTINUOUS

A FLASHLIGHT winks on. Scott and Eric are in the middle of
the basements black void.
83.

ERIC
Tell me you saved the game.

scorT
We should have gone to Prom.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

The gym is a black abyss. Emergency lighting sputters to
life above green exits signs, casting the alarmed students
below in eerie silhouette.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT — CONTINUOUS

A lighter FLICKS, and the lonely butane flame casts a futile
bubble of illumination. Zach’s face glows.

SHAMS
What’s going on?

BROOKE
Did they cut the power?

ZACH
That wouldn’t make sense.

Running FOOTSTEPS on the floor above their heads. The CREAK
ef a door opening. More FOOTSTEPS, Then, glass SHATTERS.

ZACH
Shams, everyone, stay put.
(to Brooke)
Stay close.

Led by light of the tiny flame, they move as quickly as they
can through the door and up the stairs.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Officers and Agents surround the house, clutching
flashlights, guns drawn. Under the veil of blackness, the
property seems much larger, harder to easily canvas.

PERSONNEL on the street scramble to reposition the Police
vehicles so that the headlights illuminate the house. Though
they move with efficiency, the multiple distractions allow
them to miss... A FEW SHAPES ESCAPING FROM THE HOUSE!

NEARBY: Officer Paul observes the siege in progress with
concern. Another OFFICER approaches:

OFFICER PAUL
Where’s our power, Lopez?
84.

OFFICER LOPEZ
There’s a line down on Oak. We’re
talking at least another fifteen.

Officer Paul watches as Agent Ridge silently, cautiously
leads a TEAM towards the patio.

AGENT RIDGE
(to his men)
No one leaves this house.
Understood?

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Zach and Brooke reach the living room, a half-dozen kide are
watching as Weber delicately shimmies through a hole smashed
in one of the windows. Almost everyone has left.

ZACH
Stop that!

Zach grabs Weber by the belt-loops and pulls him back inside.

WEBER
What the fuck, dude!

ZACH
What are you doing?

WEBER
I’m not dying in here, man.

Zach looks out the window. He can see several SHAPES fleeing
towards the treeline surrounding the property. It’s a clear,
narrow path to freedom. He glimpses Val, the last to escape,
disappearing into the thatch of woods.

BROOKE
(to Zach)
We have to stop them.

ZACH
If they contact more people, Weber
this thing will be impossible to
stop.
(beat)
Where were they going?

WEBER
(shrugs, half-joking)
Knowing these assholes, they’d be
tempted to go to Prom--

Brooke and Zach eye one another with alarm, then glance again
towards the window...
85.

WEBER
Let the Police handle it, hero.

ZACH
The Police will kill them.
WEBER
They’re already dead.
EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Agent Ridge and his men reach the patio. In the pool,
Katie’s body has dissolved into a nearly unrecognizable blob.

The sliding doors leading inside are locked. Agent Ridge
gestures for his men to SMASH the glass.

INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The AGENTS step slowly into the living room, washed in the
Muted yellow light of the idling Police Cars outside.
FLASHLIGHT BEAMS scan the darkness, find the destroyed TV,
the blood-spattered kitchen. Drinking glasses... no kids.

ACROSS THE HOUSE, more agents BURST through the front door.
They motion the “All Clear.”

Ridge looks uncharacteristically worried.
RIDGE
I want air support. They can’t
have gotten far--
An AGENT emphatically gestures for Ridges attention, pointing
towards an open door and a stairway leading down.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, STAIRS ~ CONTINUOUS

Ridge and his men step slowly down the stairs towards the
basement, guns still at the ready.

Ridge notices the extension cord snaking its way towards the
heavy cellar door.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, CELLAR - NIGHT

The door CREAKS open. The darkness here is impenetrable.
There is faint SCUFFLING. The Agents are not alone.

AGENT RIDGE
Don’t be afraid. You’re all going
to be okay.
86.

Circles of light from the flashlights glide across the blood
soaked walls. FIND the circular saw still dripping with
gore... Then SUDDENLY FINDS CHRIS, who has pressed himself
flush against the wine racks, trying to hide.

Terrified, Chris RUSHES FORWARD, babbling through the cavity
that used to be his mouth.

CHRIS
OyMahGewd - plez gelp ge!
The closest AGENT GASPS in disgust and surprise. He
impulsively squeezes his trigger - CRACK! - and what remains
of Chris’s face EXPLODES in a geyser. His body wobbles, then
collapses to the floor.
Several STIFLED SCREAMS echo against the stone walls.

The Agents swivel on their heels nervously.

EXT. MI. VERNON STREET - NIGHT
Winston has gotten the Cruiser moving, but it’s on it’s last
legs - every foot it traverses accompanied by the SCREECH of
grinding metal. The front end is hopelessly mangled, smoke
billows from beneath the hood.

WINSTON
c’mon. C’MON--

The car dies, clanging to a permanent halt.

WINSTON
Fuck!

He looks out the window. Directly beside him, at the rear of
an immense, full parking lot, is Mt. Vernon High.

Right on cue, the power returns. The overhead fluorescents
in the parking lot illuminate. A dim but distinct CHEER
rises from the school - hundreds of relieved revelers
celebrating the resumption of prom.
WINSTON

Sweet!
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE, BASEMENT - NIGHT
The stand-off continues.

AGENT RIDGE
All of you. Come out!

Nothing. No response.
87.

SUDDENLY: the lights blaze back to life, and SHAPES lurking
in the shadows become clear. The agents are startled.

THEN: the kids make a collective RUSH towards the door —
Shams, Bob, Moose, Kirsten, Ashley - the Agents take AIM:

Moose is SHOT in the chest and collapses on an Agent,
bleeding all over while smothering him with his girth.

Agent Ridge lines up Ashley in his sights...

But Shams and Bob wrestle him to the ground. Agent Ridge
lands on the CIRCULAR SAW which WHIRS to life beneath him.

His mouth opens in a silent SCREAM, a fountain of blood
erupting over his lips.
INT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The KIDS reach the empty living room, only to find more
AGENTS, ready to pick them off one by one.

They FREEZE.

EXT. CHRIS’ HUGE PARTY HOUSE ~ CONTINUOUS

The entire property is once more blanketed by the powerful
glow of security lights.

Officer Paul stares at the house expectantly.

The sound of GUNSHOTS pierce the quiet... and Officer Paul’s
walkie blazes to life with PANICKED CHATTER.

WALKIE
(different voices)
Ridge is down ... we’ve got six
kids ... wounded, most dead... it’s
a bloodbath ...

NEWS CREWS scurry to make sense of the unfolding drama.
Groups of PARENTS press against the officers who restrain
them, desperate for anawers.

Overhead, a HELICOPTER flies past.

EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

A ring of teens loiter near the gym, taking quick, furtive
sips from concealed brown-bagged beer.

WINSTON (OFF)
What you got there?
88.

They turn in unison. Winston is swaggering towards them,
hands on hips. PANIC lights in their eyes.

TEEN 1
Nothing.

TEEN 2
Yeah, nothing Officer.

Winston snatches the paper bag from the closest teen, and
peers inside. It’s a Colt 40.

WINSTON
Uh-oh.

TEEN 3
Please, please, be cool. It’s
PROM, man.
Winston sizes them up, overflowing with pantomime
deliberation. He quickly confiscates all of their
contraband.
WINSTON
Goon. Get back inside, don’t let
me catch you out here again.
They disburse like lightning in a chorus of “Thank Yous.”
Once they’re out of sight, Winston chugs one. He tosses the
bottle into the bushes and carries the remaining inside.
EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

Zach and Brooke run through the moonlight. They bob and
weave to avoid sharp branches.

Brooke trips over a log. She falls HARD.

ZACH
You need to stop?

BROOKE
No.

Brooke gets up. They keep running, trying to find their way.

They hear the helicopter overhead. A SEARCHLIGHT traces the
ground nearby.

They duck behind a tree.

INTERCUT:

It just so happens, Agent Ridge is being carried out of the
house in a plastic bag...

OFFICER PAUL
Ridge is indisposed. Stand down.
EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

The helicopter moves in one direction. Zach and Brooke run
in the other.

BROOKE
Do you know the way?
ZACH
I_thought so. I think we’re

close...

Feeling they’ve lost their pursuers, they pause to catch
their breath.

ZACH
I’m a little turned around. You
okay?

Brooke nods. They hear RUSTLING! They look around - Bpot
the BUSH where it’s coming from.

Zach PICKS UP A BIG STICK and holds it over his head. Brooke
picks up a smaller one.

The bush rustles again and Zach SWINGS. He hits... A BODY.
EDDIE, a party-guy in a tuxedo, rolls out.

EDDIE
OWWWWWW !

Two more party-guys, LYLE and MITCH, emerge from the bushes.
90.

MITCH
Fuck! We thought you were cops.

BROOKE
What are you doing?

LYLE
We came out here to drink.

EDDIE
Wait...

Mitch looks at Zach and Brooke, still splattered with blood
from their “surgical” endeavors.

MITCH (CONT’D)
Where did you guys come from?

LYLE
They got that... “thing!”

ZACH
No. Promise.

EDDIE
Look at them! They were at Chris’!

Lyle and Mitch pick up sticks, take an offensive posture.
MITCH
Get away.

ZACH
We'll go. Just, tell us which way
the prom is.
L
Forget it!
Lyle swings at Zach. He misses.
ZACH
I’m not sick! I’m trying to help!
Doug is on his way to--
Mitch swings. He hits Zach in the leg.

ZACH
Help us! Please!

Mitch CLUBS Zach in the shoulder. Zach’s had enough. He
lays a HUGE SWING into Mitch’s RIBS. BOOM! Mitch goes down.
He chokes as he tries to get his breath. Zach looks to Lyle.

ZACH (CONT’D)
Which way?
91.

Lyle points. 4%ach and Brocke run like hell.

CUT TO:

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
Up ahead Zach and Brooke see the HIGH SCHOOL.

ZACH
Over there!

They run past a convenience store. Brooke does her best to
keep up. Zach blazes into an intersection. He look behind
him to check on Brooke. SCREEEEFECH -

A CAR HITS Zach. Zach bounces off the windshield and
somersaults onto the pavement. Brooke reaches him.

BROOKE
Are you alright?

ZACH
Yeah. I think so.

Zach is WooZY, his pants torn and the flesh beneath deeply
gouged. The IRATE DRIVER gets out of the car.

IRATE DRIVER

What the fuck, kid! You ran into

the middle of the road--
He takes long look at Zach, who’s struggles to his feet in
the beam of the headlamps. He’s bloody, wild-eyed, and
pissed. This is definitely NOT the same Zach we met
yesterday... The Driver shuts up and closes his door.
Brooke grabs him. Zach follows, now slowed by a LIMP.

BROOKE
Come onl

EXT. MI. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

A TRUCK pulls up in front of the school.

INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Sasha prepares to climb out of the cab. The TRUCK DRIVER
leers at her hungrily. Sasha is... not all there. Sweat
beads on her forehead.
92.

SASHA
Thanks for the ride.

TRUCK DRIVER
Glad I could help, darling.
(beat)
Quick kiss for luck?

SASHA
Forget it.

TRUCK DRIVER
C’mon. Peck on the cheek. Don’t
normally pick up hitchhikers...

Sasha rolls her eyes. Whatever. As she leans in for the
micro-smooch, the truck driver turns his head and kisses her
FULL ON THE MOUTH, pulling Sasha forward greedily.

SASHA
{tearing away)
Fuck you, pig!

TRUCK DRIVER
You have a nice night, Sweetheart.
You go make some horny boys night.

She flips him off. He GRUNTS like a pig as she scampers
towards the Gym. His LAUGHTER tapers as she dovetails from
view, his expression shifting to dawning displeasure. He has
something in his mouth. He fishes inside with a finger and
retrieves... A BLOODY TOOTH.

EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Winded by her brief jog, Sasha stops at a parked car to
inspect her reflection. She adjusts her hair. Puckers her
lips, then is seized by a COUGH... which expels a blob of
dark blood onto the car window.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The BAND takes a break and a DJ [50s, hopelessly out of
touch] takes over a turntable.

He unsleeves an album and places it on the spindle. The gym
floods with Air Supply’s “Two Less Lonely People.”

Kids MOAN, but don’t stop dancing.

CLOSE ON: The DJ, oblivious, nodding his head to the
smooooocoth rhythm. SUDDENLY an unseen hand SHOVES him.

WINSTON takes his place, record in hand.
93.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM ~ MOMENTS LATER
Kids shake their heads and hair to “Pour Some Sugar on Me.”

Winston makes the rounds, nods and points double-barrel
fingers at clusters of teens who smile back, confused.

He FINDS two HUSKY GIRLS and saunters over.

WINSTON
How’re you ladies tonight?

HUSKY GIRL 1
Good.

WINSTON
All alone?

HUSKY GIRL 2
Our dates took off. Evidently
drinking in the fields is more fun--
The first girl ELBOWS her.

HUSKY GIRL 1
You don’t have to tell everybody.

Winston discretely removes his HIP FLASK... Then notices the
NEWS CREW on the far side of the gym. Local reporter JILL
VALENZUELA is still pestering Prom-goers.

WINSTON
We should find a place to party.

HUSKY GIRL 1
Aren’t you a cop?

WINSTON
off duty.

They glance at one another, uncertain.
WINSTON (CONT’D)
This is Prom Night, ladies. Love
is in the air.
EXT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Winston and the two girls hang out on the floor, drinking the
recently liberated beer.

At the far end of the hall, a FIGURE bangs on the doors.
Winston excuses himself and cruises down the hali.
94.

He opens the door a crack. Standing outside, grinning
calmly, is Doug.

WINSTON
What up, dude?

DOUG
Hey--
(taking in Winston’s
uniform)
Officer. Will you let me in?

WINSTON
What's wrong with the front door?

DOUG
It’s just, look, I forgot my asthma
inhaler, and all this dancing... I
got an extra one in my locker--

WINSTON
Whatever.

He lets Doug pass, not noticing the BLOOD which coats the
side of the young man’s face. Instead, Winston trots
excitedly back to his “dates” and Doug disappears down
another corridor.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, GYMNASIUM — NIGHT
SLOW MOTION Pov: Moving through throngs of dancing students,
who shake and shimmy, pausing with momentary curiosity as

they’re passed.

REVEAL: Sasha carving her way across the dance-floor towards
the stage. Her eyes are fixed on something there:

CLOSE ON: the focus of her fascination. Resting on a faux-
marble pedestal wait the CROWNS for Prom King and Prom Queen.
She grins - missing a front tooth.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

MONTAGE: Doug travels from door to deor, sealing each one
closed via an assortment of different means: bike chains,

ZACH

I mean, look at us. We have to
find a back entrance.

INTERCUT: Each door they try has already been secured. Doug
is perpetually one step ahead.

They reach the last door. It too is locked, and the
frustration in Zach’s face is plain.

BROOKE
We're wasting too much time.

ZACE

ANOTHER QUICK SERIES OF CUTS:

Zach and Brooke dash from couple to couple, from group to

But we go back on in fifteen.
CUT TO:

A SUDDEN HUSH descends over the gymnasium. All heads TURN to
the stage. The DJ removes the needle from the record.

Sasha stands alone, the Prom Queen Tiara in her hand, blood
dribbling from the corners of her mouth. She addresses the
vast assembly of staring faces. This is her moment.

SASHA
Thank you all sooo much. This is
such an honor. A dream come true,
really.

She places the Tiara an her head.

SASHA
Is it on right? It feels weird--

Sasha over-exerts her attempt to squeeze the metal ornament
over her hair -- and PEELS THE FLESH from her scalp!

She smiles and waves benignly, blood pouring through down her
forehead and cheeks, pausing to COUGH several enormous GOBS
which splash into the crowd.

Kids SCREAM and SCATTER. Balloons POP. ONE END OF THE
BANNER falls. Tables and chairs get toppled. They’re
literally climbing and crawling over one another to reach the
doors first.

JUST THEN: Winston and his two “dates” return from their
sojourn in the hallway.
97.

SWISH-PAN FROM WINSTON’S POV: Groups simultaneously discover
that the doors are all jammed. A few find the open route
leading back to the locker room, but most are trapped.

WINSTON
(to himself)
God dammit.

Winston turns on his heels and heads back into the school,
abandoning his heavy-set new friends.

The THRONGS stream towards the main deors, but the path is
blocked by DOUG, wielding his axe.

bDoUG

HI GUYS!

(grins)
You know, I had no idea how
unpopular I was. Guess I should
have been nicer. Fact is, I hate
all of you even more than you hate
me. But even a bully needs love...

The crowd slowly backpedals away from him. He spots Mary Ann
in their midst, trying desperately to avoid his eyes.

DOUG (CONT’D)
MARY ANN MCDONOUGH! Baby!

The herd PUSHES her forward. The rest shy away from her.

DOUG (CONT’D)
Ahhh. Come here, pumpkin.

Doug slowly pute his hands around her head. She cowers.

DOUG (CONT’D)
I was dying, and you said such
awful things.

She squirms. He holds her tight and kisses her hard on the
mouth, like Michael Corleone kissed Fredo.

DOUG (CONT’D)
Love yal

She rune away.

DOUG (CONT'D)
Who else wants a warm fuzzy one?

CLANG! Zach’s garden hoe connects squarely with the side of
Doug’s head. BLOOD SPRAYS into the crowd, hitting unprepared
gawkers in the face.

ZACH
(to the crowd)
Go on! Run!
98.

Doug is already clamoring to his feet, reaching for the axe.

There is a MASS EXODUS from the Hall. Kids in formal wear

POLICE CARS, SIRENS walling, fly over the curb.
The cops lean out of their windows, GUNS DRAWN.

CURB COP #1

The cops get out of their cars. They all hear a DISPATCHER

Winston wanders the halls, the carnage of Doug’s passage all
around him, bodies in the hall, smashed lockers, severed
electrical wiring resulting in sputtering lights overhead.

He comes upon the three dead Preppie Kids. He considers them
for a LONG BEAT.

WINSTON
(to himself)
Best to handle this the Bunyon
County way.

QUICK SERIES OF CUTS: Winston emerges from the Chemistry
Classroom wearing a thick rubber apron, long latex gloves,
and carrying bottles of Isopropyl Alcohol.

He laboriously drags the bodies into a haphazard pile.

He empties the Alcohol over the corpses.

He retrieves a silver Zippo from a pocket and sets them on
fire... Whistling, he walks away.

INT. MT. VERNON HIGH SCHOOL, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Doug twirls the axe absentmindedly like a lumberjack on a
morning stroll.

He rounds a corner, and finds himself face-to-face with three
fleeing members of the STUDENT BAND. Each are lugging their
beloved instruments and Look utterly terrified,

It’s a “West Side Story” gangland stand-off; the axe-wielding
Maniac vs. the DRUMMER, the SAXOPHONIST, and the VIOLINIST.

The Saxophonist cocks the heavy brass behind his body. As
he’s about to attack... Doug swings the Axe- hitting him IN
THE ANKLE. The Saxophonist goes down.

Doug then turns on the other two, swinging wildly, narrowly
missing. The drummer assaults Doug with the Crash Cymbal.
He pulls back again, carving a deep slice of arm before the
disk CLATTERS to the floor,

Doug awings the axe upwards. IT OBLITERATES the violin, then
strikes the violinist on the inner thigh. SPLOTCH!

Doug has trouble getting the axe back out of the deep wound.
The VIOLINIST HOWLS in pain.

Using one cymbal as a shield, another as a weapon, the
Drummer redoubles his assault.

Doug abandons the axe, letting it dangle between the
SCREAMING violinist’s legs. He picks the Cymbal from the
floor... and throws it like a Frisbee. It slices through the
drummer’s neck, striking the WINDPIPE AND VIBRATES. GONG!

His work done, Doug reclaims the axe with a sickening WET
SQUELCH. He continues on his merry way, leaving the three
bleeding, writhing victims in hia wake.

Zach and Brooke tiptoe the hall, still brandishing rake and
hoe respectively.

In the Trophy Case up ahead, Zach spots DoUG’Ss REFLECTION...

Zach falls back, CRASHING through the trophy case, then is
pummeled by the falling trophies.

Doug walks in. He looks around, peeks under the desk...
Brooke has disappeared.

DOUG
Lambchop?

Then..... DING! Brooke comes out from behind the open door
and SLAMS Doug IN THE HEAD WITH AN ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER. Doug
hits the floor.

Doug puts his hands up as a futile shield; his head has taken
quite a beating, and the left side of his face has been
turned to pulp. Blood spills over his fingers.

Brooke picks up the typewriter again. She hurls it at his
head repeatedly: DING! CLICK! CHING!

Doug writhes in pain.

DOUG (CONT’D)
Fucking bitch!

Brooke runs out of the room.

Zach and Brooke run towards a corridor of classrooms... and
smack into WINSTON.

Oh thank God, we need your help,

Zach peers over Winston’s shoulder. Smoke is billowing out

Winston follows his wide-eyed gaze, and notices that the
flames from his funerary burn piles have spread to the walls

Students cower in corners, assiduously avoid one another,

the first signs of a SORE appearing around her mouth. She

Brooke drops her rake and lunges for the axe head. She
wrests it away from Doug, but trips over Winston and lands on
the blade. A pool of biood slowly forms beneath her fallen

Zach and Doug face off. Its garden rake against garden hoe.

DOUG
