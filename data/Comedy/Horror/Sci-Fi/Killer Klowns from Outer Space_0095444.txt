under her breath as he leaves her in the darkness.

In the distance behind her; a Pair of headlights appear and
move forward. Cathy turns and sees the lights approaching.

Green and Pooh continue.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT 27

They come upon a clearing in the woods. Green looks out into
the field, shocked, he can't believe what he sees.

Standing before him, lit by the full moon is a multicolored
BIG TOP TENT about twenty feet high and three hundred feet
around.

GREEN
Well I'll be greased up and fried!
What in blue blazes is the circus
doing up in these parts.
(he looks down at Pooh)
I loves the circus. Come on, maybe
we can get some free passes.

Green happily walks towards the tent. Green gets closer and
comes upon a cable of purple lights that streches from the
ground to the tent.

GREEN

Where is everybody? There's nobody
around. I don't know Pooh, something
is a bit peculiar around here.

Green approaches the tent.

There‘s got to be some kind of
entrance here somewhere. Where's

As Green walks around, a shadow appears inside the tent and
follows him. Pooh looks back, curious. A YELLOW STREAK OF

appears.

Funny klown hands holding @ huge DOG CATCHERS NET slowly

quick swipe. The slit closes. Farmer Green continuing his
search, notices Poch-Bear is missing.

GREEN
Pooh! Pooh~Bear! Where is that dog?

He backtracks to look for Pooh and nctices her kercheif by the tent.

He looks for some kind of opening in the tent. No
luck. He begins to bang on it, it clangs like a hollow stael
drum.

GREEN
Samething mighty funny’s going on
here.

He bends over and tries to go under the tent flap. He can’t
seem to find the battom of the flap. Green digs down into the
soft dirt and discovers the tent continues below the surface.

GREEN
What in tarnation is going on here?

Green kicks the tent with his foot. The tent echoes with an
empty tone and Green hops around in pain.

GREEN
Well goddamn, this thing is like no
tent I’ve evar seen. Where’s my
dog? Where’s my Pooh~Bear? Well
I’ll rip this dang thing apart with
my bare hands!

Green is angry now. He grabs one of the support cables ana
Pulls it. It emits large PURPLE SPARKS on contact. Farmer
Green is tossed about until he can break free.

GREEN
Shoot! This thing is wired!

His hands are smoking and he blows on them. Suddenly, a large
klown appears in tne foreground. Green, a little surprised,
sees the kiown and approaches him. As he comes closer Green’s
eyes fill with fear. Something is horribly strange. The klown
snarls. Green crpens his mouth to scream as an eerie PINK
LIGHT shines on him with haunting caliope music.

INT. BIG TOP CORRIDOR — NIGHT 34

The couple is walking cauticusly through a darkened corridor,
in and out of pools of colored lights. The corrider gradually
brightens as they proceed.

DEBBIE
What kind of circus is this?

As they continue the light gets brighter and we see the walls
have a multi-colored candy striped pattern on them.

DEBBIE
Looks like Liberaci‘’s playroom...

MIKE |

European circus fantastique.

circus. He dances around.

It was terrifying. §’11 never

about clowns.

MIKE

Mike turns and looks down the corridor.

MIKE
Let‘s just gc to the end of this

Mike and Debbie are standing in the doorway Overlooking a
cavernous power facility that spirals hundreds of feet below
them. From the depths, spinning turbines powered by what
seems to be a HUGE GUMBALL MACHINE generate an enormous .
amount of energy. The couple is dwarfed by the vastness of
the interior. They are dumfounded. Debbie grabs Mike’s arm as
they peer out over the eoge.

MIKE

MIKE

Shadows stretch across the corridor floor approacning them.

COCOONS. They seem tc be made of a pink fibrous material
reminiscent of cotton candy. The couple relaxes safe fram
immediate danger. They move through the room.

DEBBIE
How we gonna get out of here?

Mike surveys the situation. He notices a sweet syrupy scent
permeating the air.

MIME
What kind of Place is this?

Mike sniffs.

MIKE

{eont)
It smells like candy in here. I
don’t know what we saw out there

factory.

real, we’re trapped in one now!

Mike
That’s too weird. That’s National
Enquirer stuff. Just calm down,
there’s got to be a logical
explanation for this.

DEBBIE
This isn’t what you think it is.

Debbie walks over tc the cocoon and takes a closer look.
DEBRIE
This isn’t cotton candy. Nobody
stores cotton candy like this.

Mike, in an effort to calm Debbie‘’s fears, reaches over and
tears a chunk from the cocoon.

MIKE
Look, Debbie ya see.

Mike ig about to put the pink substance into his mouth when
Debbie looks at where he tore the piece from.

Inside the cocoon, frozen in a death grimace, is a CANDY
COATED FARMER GREEN.

Debbie screams. Mike sees Green and spits the stuff from his
mouth. They huddle together. Scared.

Saunds of samething at the door. The couple run and hide

FISHING POLE. He hoists the cocoon up with the athers.

Mike and Debbie are trapped.

The klown moves to the opposite side of the room and begin to
orerate one of the odd machines.

Mike and Debbie watch in horror as the klown picks up a Dr.
Suess space age POPCORN GUN and begins to fill it with a
Papcorn like substance.

Mike and Debbie take this oprortunity to work their way out
the door, keeping the cocoons between themselves and the
klown. @s they get closer to the entrance they pass the
freshly hung cocoon.

Mike glances at it and recognizes the contorted body within.
Mike is shocked.

Two klowns emerge from the entrancey looking around for their

the trigger and blows him away.

The klowns hand pops back up.
The kid is relieved.

The girl puppet points the ray-gun at the klown. He shakes
his head, "Oh no".

The Puppet turns the gun teward the kid and fires.

ZAAP' & pink ray shoots out and the kid is enveloped by a
Pink fibrous material. The kid is now encased in a pink

Mooney and stops at his desk. Motionless. Mooney is surprised
but Pleased.
MOONEY . so
Well, whoop-de—god-daan-de—de! |
What do we have here?

Mooney looks closely at the klown. He stands up and leans
forward, inspecting the klown from head to toe.

MOONEY
Well boy, I think you made a big
mistake. You’re in my territory
now.

The klown magically produces a colorful bouquet of flowers
and thrusts it into Mooney’s face. He looks at the flowers
Suspiciously. Mooney looks back at the klown with contempt. 4
stream of BLACK LIQUID comes squirting from the flowers;
hitting Mooney in the face. Mooney lurches back. He is
Pissed.

MOONEY
(flustered)
Why wou..ah...I oughta shoot you

Mooney wipes his face, walks around the desk, pulls out his
cuffs. He turns the klown around.

MOONEY
I’m supposed to inform you of your
rights. Well, vou ain’t got no
rights in Mooney‘’s Jail.

Mooney slaps the cuffs on the klown’s wrists and spins him
around to face hia.

Mooney needles the klown.

friend, BILLY the CLUB.

Mooney pushes the klown forward holding onto the cuffs around

The klown shuffles in, Mooney follows, gun drawn. The klown
turns to face hia.

MOONEY
Alright, get your hands up.

The klown raises his arms. Sleeves empty. Mooney is steaming.
Klown hands pop out. Mooney is furious now. The klown is
making fun of him.

Mooney opens the cell door and shoves the klown in. Before
Mooney, closes the cell he whacks the klown on the back of
it’s head.

The klown doesn’t react. Mooney is scared. The klown’s head
Spins around on it’s shoulders, 1980 degrees facing Fooney. It
smiles.

Mooney is shocked. He slams the cell door on the klown and
steps back. The klown rotates it’s body to right it’s head.

MOONEY
I don’t know who you are, but
before this night is over you'll be
begging for merc.

The klown pulls aut a PARTY FAVOR. Puts it to his lips ana
blows. It unfolds and shoots through the cell bars towards
Mooney. The tip turns into two CANDY STRIPED HANDS that grab
Mooney by his shirt collar. Mooney is shocked. The hands tear
Mooney forward slamming him into the cell bars: knocking nim
out. The punkers in the next cell watch horrified.

EXT. BAR BACK ENTRANCE — NIGHT oe
A group of four bikers and their biker chicks are parked

behind a sleazy bar. They are just hanging cut, drinking beer
and revving their bikes.

Suddenly a bright light blares on the group. They shield

their eves to see what's coming. There’s the sound of a
Powerful motorcycle approaching. A single headlight maves
toward them.

Inta the group rides a small klown atop a CHILD’S TRICYCLE.
He sweeps by and stops.

The klown slowly climbs off the bike.

The bikers are laughing their heads off, making comments.

Black Biker
Hey look at what we have here.
ocooohh, it's Big Bad Bozo coming to

One especially large biker, SLUG, is watching with his ald
lady, SHEILA. Slug gets off his bike and makes his way toward
the klown pushing through the other bikers.

SHEILA
Get’em Slug.

SLUG
Watch this.

Slug steps up to the klown.

SLUG
Hew clowny: mean bike you got
there.

The klown reaches out and hanks the little horn on his
handlebars. BEEP BEEP.

Slug looks back at his gang with a mocking sneer. He turns
back to the klawn and runs his hand gently on the tricycle.

SLUG
You know bud, you sure are one ugly
clown, but this is one fine machine
you got here. Bet vou tear up the
road with this beauty. Can I take a
ride pal?

The klown shakes his head no. It rattles.

SLUG
Oh please, pretty please. ['1l taxe
real good care of it.

The klawn shakes, No. Slug turns tc his gang, sad. Then back
ta the klown.

SLUG

The kiown nods, Yes. Slug rears up, hands clasped.

SLUG
Ohe thank you.

Slug reaches down slowly; grabs the handlebars and wildly

smashes the tricycle on the savement. The gang hocts anc
cheers madly.

The klown stands by, passively watching Slug bash his bike
into a tangled heap.

Slug drops the mess down in front of the klown.
@ black biker from the crowd whispers to an associate.

BLACK BIKER
Shoulda let the man ride his bike.

SLUG
Ob I’m sorry. I seem to have broken
your bike.

The klown loaks down at the mess. The bikers laugh.

From the back of the crowd Sheila yells.

SHEILA
Tweek his nose, why don’t cha.

Slug smiles, loving the center ring attention.

SLUG
Why I think f will tweek that big
ol’red nose of yours.

Slug reaches down for the nose.

The klown quickly grabs his wrist, hoiding it still, right in
front of his nose.

Slug grimaces in pain, surprised by the little klown’s
strength. Slug can’t back down with his gang watching. He
musters all his strength and breaks free. Slug pulls aut his
Switchblade.

SLUG
Ok clowny face. I’m gonna cut that
nose off and give it to my girl.

Sheila seiles.

Slug tosses the knife back and forth between his hands. The
klown jumps out of frase.

The klown lands back in frame wearing CARTOON BOXING GLOVES.
He bops around in a zany sparring routine, poking, jabbing
and sometimes hitting himself in the head.

The gang is amused. Slug becomes bold again, edged on by the
crowd.

SLUGS
What are you going to de?
(turns to his gang}
Knock my block off?

Slug turns back to the klown. SPROOOCNGG!! The klown’s glave
shoots from his sleeve and smashes Slug in the face.

The gang Screams and is splattered with blood. SLUG’S HEAD
bounces, hits the wall and comes to rest by a trash can.

The klown is standing quietly while Slug’s decapitated body
Quivers and flops to the ground.

The gang panics. They hop on their bikes and race away. |

Sheila can’t get the big bike started, it falls. She screams

and runs auay with her fat ass bouncing in her stretch pants.
The littlw® klown sneers an evil, tootny smile.

He looks around. No one.

Dave notices something on the floor. GIANT ORANGE FOOTPRINTS
lead a winding path to the jail cells in the back. He draus
nis gun and cautiously appreaches the door.
Grabs the knob ane slowly turns it. Dave is sweating. He
throws the door open and jumps to the side. He peers in.
Nothing. He relaxes for a moment, his head down.
Dave raises his gun and walks slowly toward the back.
INT. JAIL ROOM - NIGHT 102

Dave carefully opens the door and walks into the jail reom.
His eyes follow the prints up and around, his face distorted
with fear and amazement. The floor and walls are covered in
MULTI-COLORED FOOTPRINTS.

DAVE
Mooney. Are you back here?

Dave walks to the second call, it’s open.

The flashlight beam falls on a large pink mass stuffed into
the corner. It is a cocoon like the one Mike described. He
moves toward it.

He reeas to knaw if ther2’s a body inside and who’s body.
Dave touches the fibrous material and tears some from the
cocoon.

It’s the same stuff he removed from the car at Top of the ‘
World. We hear (not Dave) a SOFT SQUISHY SOUND. Dave looks ,
more closely at the cocoon.

He can faintly see a figure inside. He reaches for it. A
squishy tearing sound. Dave hears it, turns and loaks behind
him.
i103

Me locks up and SQUARSH, the cancy coated corpse of a sunker
comes Sliding dawn. It is hanging hal* Sut of a cecoon stuck
te the ceiling.

Dave startled falls back and Scurries out of the cell. He
backs up against the wall, repulsed. He takes a breath, -
stands and staggers into the front office.

INT. POLICE STATION = NIGHT 103

Dave staggers through the office, we see the EIGHT FOOT KLOWN
sitting at the desk behind his.

The klown slowly spins his chair around to face Dave. SQUEAK.
The chair squeaks. Dave freezes, he's afraid to turn around.

He turns siowly and sees the klown Sitting, smiling at hia.
Mooney sits up in his lap. His eyes are glazed his expression
one of sheer terror. Mooney speaks;

MOONEY
Hey Dave, who was that lady I saw
wou with last night?

Mooney is dead; being manipulated like soae deranged
ventriloquist dGunmy. Dave is in TOTAL GROSSED OUT SHOCK. He
stands there dumfounded.

MOONEY
Don‘t be afraid, Dave. we only want
to KILL you:

The klown pulls his hand out of Mooney’s back, shaking
entrails from his hand. It lifts Mooney off his lap and drops
him to the floor.

Mooney’s dead face hits the linocleun.

The klown rises, Dave stands helpless. The klown moves toward
Dave, it pulls out a PUPPET RAY GUN and points it at Dave.

Dave puils out his gun and fires at the klown.

The klown squeaks with each bullets impact and continues to
advance. It shoves the desk out of it’s ay like a toy. Dave
Shoots again and again at the klown’s body.

Dave sees it’s useless, raises his sights to the klown’s
BULBOUS RED NOSE. He pauses then fires. BANG!

The nose shatters in a RED BLOODY MASS, confetti shaoting out
of it’s nose. It goes into convulsions as it emits ear
splitting shrieks. The klown spins like a TOP.

with a huge vacuum hose.

Klowns emerge from the buildings, carrying cocoons and
balloons. The cocoons are elaced in the street to be sucked
up while the balloons are placed in racks on the back of the

INT. DEBBIE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 107

Debbie walks into the bathroom, dressed. She brushes her .
hair. Debbie sips some wine. She is worried about Mike. Her
@yes begin to tear. She can’t grasp what is happening. She
doesn’t want to be alone. The fear is creeping up on her
again. She hears noises through out the house.

She hears a springy sound come from the cabinet behing her.
She turns to it.

In a flash something bursts toward her out of the hamper; two
spall abhorrent KLOWN JACK IN THE BOXES with dripping
Snapping jaws.

Debbie jumps backwards, barely evading the slashing fangs.
She slams into the sink, immediately the medicine cabinet
bursts open and another JACK IN THE BOX creature lunges.

This one digs it’s teeth into Debbie’s shoulder. She screams
but the thing is amazingly strong and she can’t free herself.
She struggles in agony to reach the aerosol can on the
counter.

Just as she is about to grab it; a second kiown leases from
the cabinet and bites into her shoulder. She falters for a
moment.

and spring wildly about in agony.
Debbie slams the cabinet doors closed on them. The hamper
klowns hop toward her. She kicks the hamper and it falls in
front of the door. Her escape is blocked by the HAMPER
KLOWNS. She looks far another escape.
Slowly behind her; the toilet lid begins ta open. Rising
menacingly behind her is a Larger; even more gruesome JACK IN
THE BOX DEMON.

It snarls; revealing its corroded dripping fangs. It recoils
on its spring like some huge copra preparing to strike.

Debbie whirls around and comes face to face with the thing.
It lunges. She falls backwards into the tub.

The thing snaps at her. She cowers back, looks up and sees
the shower massager.

It snaps at her again. She cowers back.

With lightning speed, Debbie grabs the massager and shoves it
down the things throat.

She reaches for the faucets and turns the shower on.

The force of the water whips the creature around wildly.

She grabs the shower curtain, runs at the creatures blocking

her exit, throws the curtains over them and leaps out the

door.

slides down the wall into a mass resembling a disgusting
banana split.

One klown grabs the Debbie balloon as the group parades into

experiments, to dissect and study.

DAVE
Then they’re intelligent. Why don’t
they communicate with us? Talk to
us instead of slaughtering us.

PAUL
Maybe they’re Just cruising through
the galaa and stopped here for a
bite to eat.

The group stops in their tracks and looks at Paul. Maybe Paul
is right. Dave breaks the spell.

DAVE
Okay, quiet down. Let’s not give
ourselves away. We’ve got to find
Debbie.

They continue, quietly and cautiously.
INT. MIRRORED CORRIDOR - NIGHT 127

The group walks through a corridor filled with wanky mirrors.
Their reflections bend and contort with every step.

Mike and Dave do not react to their reflections. Rich and

Paul

They all look at Paul, suspiciously. Paul cringes,
innocently.

DAVE
(orders)
Don’t touch anwthing, okay. This
Place is probably booby-trapped.

They move ahead cautiously. At the end of the corridor there
is a door. Dave reaches for the knob. He turns back to the
group.

DAVE
I want everyone to stay close,
stick together. I gon’t want to
have to run around and save you
@uys too.

RICH
No problem, we can handle it.

Dave throws the brothers a dubious glance. He turns to the
door, pauses then throws the door open. SWISHHH, The Terenzi
brothers drap from sight through the floor. Dave and Mike
turn to see the brothers gone.

DAVE
Where the hell did they go? !
thought I told them to stay close.

They race around the reoe, looking through the rows of
cocoons for Deobie’s balloon.

Suddenly, the door opens and a klown enters. Mike and Dave
freeze: then sneak behind the cocoons.

The klown closes the door behind him and stands blocking the
exit. It searches the room, darting it’s head around.
Listening, sniffing. The klown walks toward the guys. It
stops at a cocoon, sniffs it and squeezes it. He soves to
another one and repeats the routine. Mike and Dave are
Scared, confused.

The klown is inspecting the cocoons and coming claser to
them.

Dave siowly reaches for his gun.

The klown stops. He seems to have found one to his liking.
The klown looks around to check if the coast is clear, then
Pulls out a large TWIRLY STRAW.

Mike and Dave watch curiously as the kiown pokas the stras
into the cocoon.

He places it to his lips and begins to suck. A bright red
liquid comes spiraling up the twisting straw into the kloun‘s
mouth.

Mike and Dave are totally disgusted. The klown is sucking the
juices of the victims encased in the cocceons. UHHGG'! The
klown sucks until there is no more. He smacks his lips and
burps.

Mike and Dave uncerstand the klowns motives. They are
speechless.

The klown exits through a door on the far side of the raca.

MIKE
That’s her. She’s alive.

He turns to Dave.

MIKE
How do we get her out?

Mike pounds on the balloon. His fists bounce off, no effect.

DEBBIE
This certainly has been a night to
remember.
All around them are klowns. Twenty of them with guns and
clubs; bats with nails in them, catchers mitts; all in all a
rather formidable klown army.

The klowns climb up after them.
CRASH '! & loud rumble is heard from the Playground wall.
The kiowns turn to the sound.

Something is bursting through the wall.

Mike, Debbie and Dave look to the wall.

Through the wall bursts the BOBO ice cream truck. Inside,
Clothes ripped to shreds, lip stick all over them, the
TERENZI BROS. to the rescue. The truck stops mid way through
the wall with the giant Bobo head rocking back and forth.
The klowns have been momentarily cistracted.

Mike, Debbie and Dave can’t believe what they are seeing.

Mike and Debbie get into the truck and Dave gces to the rear
to remove debris. Rich pops the truck into reverse, slams on
the gas. The tires burn rubber, but the truck won't move.
It’s wedged solidly in the hole in the wall.
