"REUNION"

FADE IN:
EXT. NEWMAN HOUSE - DUSK

The one story ranch house sits surrounded by other middle-
class abodes.

A sedan pulls into the driveway and the driver, TOM NEWMAN,
gets out and walks into the house.

CLOSE - INVITATION

A simple invitation reads: "ST. MARY'S HIGH SCHOOL welcomes
the class of '87 for their 10 year class reunion."

INT. KITCHEN

The kitchen appears neat and clean but nothing fancy.
ROSE-MARIE NEWMAN (ROSE) sits at the kitchen table looking at
the invitation. Rose, twenty-eight years old, Italian-

Catholic, wears a drab business suit.

The off screen sound of the front door closing and Tom
enters.

TOM
You ready?

ROSE
I'm waiting for you.

Tom's an accountant and looks like it.
INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Rose stands in front of the mirror modeling a pair of jeans.
ROSE

I want to go to the beach, too. You

think you could call Sarah and tell

her I'm sick?
Tom stands by the closet, in his boxer shorts, putting his
slacks carefully on a hanger. He's still wearing his shirt
and tie.

TOM
Yeah, what do you want me to say?

ROSE
That woman'll believe anything.
Just tell her I have the flu.
Rose stares at herself in the mirror.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Do these jeans make me look fat?

TOM
No.

ROSE
Yes, they do.

TOM
No, they don't. You look great.

Tom kisses Rose on the forehead.
INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Rose and Tom prepare the bed for their guests.

TOM
I'm really looking forward to this
weekend.

ROSE

Yeah well, it's just going to be a
big headache for me.

TOM
No it's not.

ROSE
You know, you could have just told
him to stay at a hotel. It's not
like he can't afford it.

TOM
It's going to be fun.

ROSE
That's Jacob talking, not you.
You've got to stop letting people
put words in your mouth.

Rose snaps the sheet into place and moves to prepare the rest
of the bedding.

TOM
I know, but--

ROSE
--Sure, it's fun for him, but I'm
the one that gets stuck doing all
the work.

TOM
I know.

ROSE
--It's a lot of work getting the
house ready for guests. Cooking
and cleaning and I have to go
shopping...

TOM
--I know.

ROSE
--and then when they all leave I
have to wash all the sheets and
clean up after everyone.
Tom moves to Rose and kisses her on the forehead.

TOM
I know, and I love you for it.

ROSE
No, you don't.

TOM
Yes, I do.

Rose moves away from Tom and starts for the exit.
ROSE
If Elizabeth doesn't come he's
sleeping on the couch and Hannah's
sleeping in here.

TOM
No, he said Elizabeth was coming.

ROSE
She is?

INT. PATIO - NIGHT
The patio is sparsely furnished, used mostly for storage.

Rose covers a small sofa with a sheet and some blankets. Tom
pulls a pillow case onto a pillow.

ROSE
If Neil doesn't like sleeping out
here he can go stay at a hotel. I
am not putting Hannah out here. I
told her she could stay with us
before I knew Neil was coming.

TOM
Don't worry, he'll love it.

ROSE
What does Neil do? Does he work?

TOM
I'm not sure. Jacob didn't say.

ROSE
Did he ever finish college?

TOM
I'm not sure about that either.

Rose rolls her eyes as she tucks the final corner of bedding
into the sofa.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rose vacuums.
INT. KITCHEN

Tom enters, pulls a full bag of garbage out of the trash can,
and exits to the patio.

INT. PATIO
as Tom exits outside with the garbage.
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
Tom drags the trash cans to the street and goes back inside.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tom and Rose lie in bed.
ROSE
Don't you think it would be more
fun to go to Essex Canyon then the

beach?

TOM
Yeah, sure.

ROSE
It's too cold this time of year to
go to the beach.

TOM
That's a good point.

ROSE
Maybe we can all go to church on
Sunday.

TOM
Yeah, that'd be fun.

Silence. Darkness.

ROSE
Tom?

ROSE (CONT'D)
Yeah?

ROSE (CONT'D)
Do you think I'm a bitch?

TOM
No, of course not. I love you.

Tom kisses Rose.

ROSE
I mean, I don't want you to think I
hate all your friends.

TOM
I don't.

ROSE
I don't hate Neil, he's just such
a... loser. And if Jacob weren't
such a self-centered, egomaniac...

TOM
Yeah, but there's something about
the guy you just got to like.

ROSE
I don't have the vaguest idea what
that might be. He's just so full
of himself. He needs to get a
life.

(CONTINUED)

TOM
He's got a life.

ROSE
Who knows, maybe he's grown up a
little since we last saw him.

TOM
Probably not.

Rose moves toward Tom.

ROSE
Tom?

TOM
Yeah?

ROSE

I'm ovulating tonight.

Tom smiles and Rose kisses Tom and moves on top of him and
they make love and...

Tom climaxes and...
Rose rolls off him.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Did he say what time he would be
getting here?

TOM
Who?

ROSE
Jacob... and Elizabeth.

TOM
I don't know, they're flying and
they got to rent a car and stuff. I
guess around noon.
Tom's eyes wander shut.

ROSE
What time is Neil getting here?

TOM
(starting to fall asleep)
Who knows.

Rose stares at the ceiling, finally says:

ROSE
Tom?
TOM
(drifting off)
Hum?

ROSE
I'm glad we stayed in Bowie. I
wouldn't want to live in New York
even if you were going to make
twice as much money as Jacob. I
mean, aren't you glad we stayed?

TOM
Yeah, of course.

ROSE
New York is no place to raise a
family. And people in big cites
are so cold and... hard. You can't
trust'em with a dime.
(and)
I guess I just kind of like it
here.
TOM
(asleep)
Me... too.
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
The house sits in the darkness.
EXT. ROAD - DAWN
A lone cyclist rides along the road: NEIL ZISKE.

His thin, muscular legs effortlessly propel the bicycle
forward.

Neil (29) looks a few years younger than either Tom or Rose.
Wind blows through his short black hair.

EXT. ROAD

as Neil peddles past the "Welcome to Bowie: population sign.
EXT. BOWIE - STREET

Neil continues, and the landscape becomes increasingly urban.

He turns onto Main Street.

Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
EXT. MAIN STREET

He keeps riding. He's alone. It's still early.

EXT. SADLER'S HARDWARE STORE - MAIN STREET

as Neil rides up in front of the store and stops. He gets
off his bike... walks to the front window... stares in for a
moment... returns to his bike and peddles away...

EXT. BOWIE - MAIN STREET

as Neil turns off into a neighborhood.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD

Neil slowly peddles through the neighborhood.

He turns into the Newman driveway.

INT. BEDROOM - DAWN

Rose and Tom sleep.

A KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK can be heard off screen.

Rose and Tom still sleep.

More KNOCKING and Tom starts to wake up and Rose, too. They
look at each other.

ROSE/TOM
Neil!

EXT. PORCH - DAWN
Tom opens the door and looks out but Neil's not there.

NEIL(0.S.)
Hey- man, what's up?

Neil sits on the front lawn stretching out. Tom sees him.

TOM
Neil... what are you doing?

NEIL
I'm stretching out- man, trying to
keep the lactose acid from building
up.

TOM
But it's six o'clock in the
morning.
NEIL

I know, I've been riding all night.
Neil grabs his bag and bounds into the house.
NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
I think I found the new way to get
here from San Francisco.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Rose prepares a pot of coffee.

Neil and Tom enter.

NEIL
Hey, Rose.

ROSE
Hello Neil.

NEIL
It's good to see you.

ROSE
How have you been?

NEIL
Good...

Neil hugs Rose. She reluctantly hugs him back.
ROSE
I've got to get ready. Show Neil
where he's staying.
Rose exits.
Neil grabs a banana as they exit the kitchen.
NEIL
You guys got any Kiwi fruit? To
replace the selenium I lost?
TOM

Sorry, I just ate the last one
before you got here.

INT. PATIO

as Tom and Neil enter.

TOM
I hope this is alright. It's
just... we already told Hannah she
could stay, so this is the only
place left.

NEIL

No need to apologize, man. This is
great. Just give me a couple of
blankets and I'll be fine.

Neil surveys the patio as he chomps on his banana. He throws
his bag onto the sofa.

CLOSE - A WOMAN'S WATCH READS: 11:00 a.m.

ROSE (0.S)
She should have been here by now.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

as Rose looks at her watch, pacing back and forth. She's
dressed now.

Tom sits on the couch.

ROSE
I wonder if--

But the off screen sound of a car silences Rose. She darts
for the front door.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY

A TAN '67 VOLVO STATION WAGON pulls into the driveway. The
driver, HANNAH JOHNSON, gets out of the car and...

the front door swings open and Rose runs down the steps
toward the driveway and...

Hannah sees Rose approaching and her arms open up and they
share a huge hug.

HANNAH
Bear!

ROSE
Pan!

And they're laughing now as they hug.

ROSE (CONT'D)
I can't believe it!

Rose steps back to get a better look at Hannah.

Rose Look at you...

Hannah's long, blonde hair glows and her clean face shines
without any make-up. Her "artsy" clothes hang off her body,
concealing what could potentially be a very attractive
figure.

HANNAH
What, you don't like it?

ROSE
No, it's not that, it's just...
it's different.

HANNAH
I told you I'd changed.

Tom approaches from the porch.
ROSE
I know I- I just didn't quite
envision it like this.

HANNAH
You don't like it.

Hannah smiles, and when she smiles her whole face lights up.

ROSE
No I like it... Really.

And they share another terrific hug.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
as Rose and Hannah enter.
ROSE
You're on the couch. Neil's

staying out there.

HANNAH
Neil?

ROSE
You remember... Jacob's basketball
friend?

Tom enters carrying Hannah's bag and a guitar.

HANNAH
Oh, yeah.

INT. PATIO - DAY
Neil sits in a wicker chair reading.
Hannah pokes her head into the patio, says:
HANNAH
I guess we're going to be

neighbors.

Neil looks up from his reading and immediately recognizes
Hannah.

NEIL
Hey, Hannah.

HANNAH
You actually... remember me?

NEIL
What are you crazy? Of course.
Fifth period. Mr. Morton's Lit
class.

Neil and Hannah laugh as they speak together:
NEIL/HANNAH
"Sin is a demon crouching at the
door. It shall be eager for you,
and you will be mastered by it, but
you must master it."
And they continue to laugh as Rose enters.

ROSE
What was that?

HANNAH
It was Mr. Morton. He made us
memorize that quote for every test.

ROSE
Why?

HANNAH
It's a long story.

Hannah looks at Neil, he nods.

ROSE
Come on, I want to give you the
tour.

NEIL

See you later, Hannah.

Hannah turns back and smiles at Neil as she disappears into
the house. Tom slowly enters.

TOM
So... what are you reading?

Neil holds the book up. It's a bible.

NEIL
It's the word of God, man.

INT. KITCHEN
Rose and Hannah enter.
ROSE
(pointing to the counters)
We're going to have all this redone
this summer.

HANNAH
Is Jacob staying here, too?

ROSE
Unfortunately.

Rose moves further into the kitchen. Hannah follows.

HANNAH
Why didn't you tell me?

ROSE
What's to tell? You know Tom is
his best friend. Where else would
he be staying?
Rose moves to the window.
ROSE (CONT'D)

We're going to have a bay window
put in over here.

CONTINUED:
HANNAH
Forget the bay window! What about
Jacob?
ROSE

What about him? He's married. And
he's still a jerk.

HANNAH
But it's "Jacob Barrett." Remember?

ROSE
You can't possibly still have a
crush on him?

HANNAH
I- I don't know. I really hadn't
thought much about him until- until
just now. You never think about

him?

ROSE
The thought of that egotistical,
self-centered... asshole makes my

blood boil. I didn't even want him
to stay here.

HANNAH
Really?

ROSE
--Really.

HANNAH

You never told Tom about you and--

Horrified, Rose moves closer to Hannah to make sure no one is
listening.

ROSE
(interrupting)
--No, and I'm not going to. God,
it's embarrassing it ever happened.
It was such a mistake.

HANNAH
Maybe you're lucky you got him out
of your system... "Bear."

ROSE

(half mad, half laughing)
Don't call me that.

They both start laughing.
INT. PATIO - DAY

Neil and Tom sit in the patio furniture. Tom glances at his
watch.

TOM
Did jacob say what time he was
going to be here?

NEIL
No.

Tom nods and they sit in silence and Neil starts to read the
bible.

TOM
So what have you been up to?

NEIL
Serving the Lord, man.

TOM
Does the lord pay your bills?

NEIL
He can. But I've been ridding a
rickshaw around San Francisco.

TOM
--One of those bikes with a
carriage behind it?

NEIL
--Yeah.

TOM
Do you like it?

NEIL
Yeah, it's a pretty good set up,
for the most part. I just try and
stay on top of the managers to keep
the bikes maintained.
Tom glances at this watch.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Rose and Hannah are seated at the kitchen table drinking
coffee.

ROSE
I hate-- no, I don't hate, I feel
sorry for her. She is such a
wonderful person.

HANNAH
What's she like?

ROSE
I wish you knew her. It's just so
hard working for someone like her.
But enough about me. Tell me about
you. Are you seeing anyone?

HANNAH
.-.-I'm dating.

ROSE
I'm glad I got those days out of
the way in high school. Is it
anything serious?

HANNAH
No... not really.

ROSE
Is that what you want?

HANNAH
Yeah, right now I think it is. I'm
just concentrating on my music.

ROSE
You are so good. You're going to
be the next Tori Amos.

Hannah blushes.

HANNAH
I finally feel like I'm choosing
music, instead of it choosing me,
you know? I always felt like I
retreated to my guitar because I
was alone or- or didn't have a
boyfriend. But now, I've got
"boyfriends" and- and I've still
got my guitar, too.

ROSE
You're going to find someone and
you're going to be so happy.

HANNAH
Maybe.

They sip their coffee.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
It looks like you're really happy

here.
ROSE
I am- I mean we are.
HANNAH
You guys thinking about starting a
family?
ROSE

Yeah, we both want to have lots of
children. I thought I was pregnant
last month but it was just a false
alarm. Tom's sperm count is a
little low. The doctor says it's
nothing to worry about, we just got
to keep trying.

HANNAH
That could be fun.

INT. CAR - DAY

JACOB BARRET drives. His wife, ELIZABETH sits in the
passenger seat.

ELIZABETH
I just hate the way you act when
you're around them.

Of course she's beautiful, she's the former homecoming queen:
fake blonde hair, a thick coat of make-up covering her face,
and the best clothes that money can buy.

JACOB
Quit your complaining. It'll be
good for us to be out of the city
for a while... Let us unwind a
little... Relax.

Jacob may not be as beautiful as Elizabeth, but what he lacks
in beauty he makes up for in pure ego.

ELIZABETH
I don't see why we couldn't just
stay at a hotel.

JACOB
Because I said so, okay?

Elizabeth pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

ELIZABETH
You just want to fuck Rose again.

JACOB
Shut the fuck up. If I wanted to
get laid, I could get laid, just
like in high school, no matter what
hotel we stayed in.
Elizabeth sucks on her cigarette.

ELIZABETH
And what, you don't think I could?

Jacob glares at Elizabeth.
EXT. HOUSE - STREET - DAY
As Jacob's DELUXE HERTZ RENTAL CAR pulls into the driveway.
INT. CAR
Jacob stares at Elizabeth. Jacob hits the horn. HONK!
And the second that Tom appears on the porch Jacob wipes the
scowl off his face and replaces it with a warm, almost
sincere smile.
EXT. HOUSE
Tom moves toward the driveway.
Neil appears on the porch followed by Hannah and Rose.
Jacob gets out of the car and yells:

JACOB

Shit, you didn't tell me you lived

in a mansion!

Tom gets to Jacob and they shake hands. Jacob's superior
size becomes quite obvious standing next to Tom.

JACOB (CONT'D)
This your place?

Tom nods.

TOM

JACOB
Fuck, yeah.

And now Neil arrives at the car.

JACOB (CONT'D)
Neil, you fucking jock.

NEIL
What's up, man?

Jacob slaps Neil on the back and they share a hug.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
Hey Elizabeth. How's it going?

Elizabeth is still in the car smoking her cigarette. She
smiles at Neil-- sort of.

Jacob throws his arms around Neil and Tom, and leads them
toward the house.

AT THE PORCH

the "boys" move into the house, passing Rose and Hannah.

JACOB
Hello RoseMarie.

ROSE
--Jacob.

JACOB

Thanks for putting us up. It's
going to be a fucking blast.

ROSE
Where else would you stay? You
remember Hannah?

Hannah steps forward and extends her hand and Jacob shakes
her hand but he doesn't remember her.

JACOB
Yeah... of course.

Jacob stares blankly at Hannah.

JACOB
You sat... over by the window?

HANNAH
Close. I sat near the door, right
next to you.

JACOB
--Oh?

HANNAH
Pimples... and glasses... and
braces?

Jacob laughs a little and looks at the others, not sure if
she's serious or not.

JACOB
I'm sorry, I mean, I'm surprised I
don 't--

HANNAH
(interrupting)
--It's alright. There's not much
to remember.
ROSE

Don't worry, you'll remember. Tom,
take him in and show him his room.

Rose pushes Tom forward.
ROSE (CONT'D)
(continuing)
You're staying in the guest room.

TOM
Come on.

The "boys" go into the house.

Elizabeth struggles with several suit cases as she climbs the
porch steps. She smiles as she passes Rose, a cigarette
dangling out of her mouth.

Hannah holds the door open.

INT. GUEST BEDROOM
Tom and Jacob enter. They toss a few bags on the bed.
JACOB
So are we going to the beach, or
are we going to the beach?
TOM
I guess we're... going to the
beach!
EXT. BEACH - DAY

Neil pulls his shirt off as he runs toward the water.

Jacob and Tom are right behind him, kicking their shoes and
shirts aside.

Neil doesn't stop, he dives straight into the water. Jacob
follows, diving after Neil, into the ocean.

But Tom stops at the edge and pokes his foot into the cold
seawater.

Neil and Jacob frolic in the water for a moment until Jacob
sees Tom at the edge.

JACOB
Come on in, you fucking wimp.

Jacob kicks water at Tom and it's cold and Tom cowers back.
JACOB (CONT'D)
Whoooo! It's fucking freezing! I
love it!

EXT. PARKING LOT/BEACH

Hannah and Rose carry a few beach items toward the water;
lawn chairs, a basket, towels, a few blankets.

And in the background Elizabeth walks away from them, further
down the beach.

ROSE
If you wanted to go to Essex Canyon
you should have said something.

HANNAH
It doesn't matter to me.
ROSE
It's just that it's too cold for

the beach.

About half way to the water, they stop and spread one of the
blankets out over the sand.

Jacob and Neil run up and grab for a few towels and start
drying themselves off.

HANNAH
How is it?

TOM
It's cold.

ROSE
I told you.

JACOB
It's good for you, wakes you up.
Let's you know you're alive.

ROSE
I don't need to jump into cold
water to know I'm alive.

EXT. BEACH - LATER
Everyone is lounging on the blankets and lawn chairs and
drinking beers which they pull out of a cooler. Two
exceptions, however: Neil drinks bottled water not beer and
Elizabeth is absent.
JACOB
So can you play that thing or do
you just carry it around for show?
ROSE
Yeah, go get your guitar and play
for us. You are so talented.

HANNAH
No... I will later.

Jacob stands up and extends his hand to Hannah.

EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT
Hannah and Jacob walk toward the Volvo.

JACOB
So you're a musician?

HANNAH
Yeah... well, aspiring musician
really. I teach music, to pay the
bills.

JACOB
What kind of music do you play?

HANNAH
I don't know, it's kind of like a
folk-rock sort of thing.

JACOB
Oh. I love folk music.

HANNAH
Yeah? Who do you like?

JACOB
Well, you know... there's just so
Many great ones. Who's your
favorite?

HANNAH
I have lots of favorites.

JACOB
--If you had to pick one.

Hannah stops, thinks for a moment.
HANNAH
David Wilcox comes to mind. His
music is so introspective. It
really speaks to me, you know?
They start walking again.
JACOB

Oh... yeah. It's food for the
soul.

JACOB

HANNAH

What's your favorite album?

Pornografiti?

They arrive at the Volvo.

JACOB
Well, yeah, that's certainly one of
them.

HANNAH
He doesn't have an album called
Pronograffiti.

Hannah unlocks the door and Jacob pulls the guitar out of the
car. Hannah moves to take the guitar from Jacob but Jacob
won't let go.

JACOB
You want to go for a ride, or
something?

This surprises Hannah and they're standing awkwardly close to
one another.

HANNAH
Right now?

JACOB
Yeah.

HANNAH
I don't know... I mean-- I want to,
but-- but what about everyone else?

JACOB
Fuck'em.

Jacob looks at his beer can and polishes off the last few
drops.

JACOB (CONT'D)
We'll tell'em we went to get more
beer. I'm sure we need it.

Hannah looks back toward the beach and then at Jacob and then
back at the beach...

We're coming right now.
And Jacob stares right back at her.
EXT. BEACH

Hannah pulls here guitar out and begins to tune it.

JACOB
Where is everyone on a great day
like this?

TOM

Everyone's working.

ROSE
Where's Elizabeth?

Everyone looks at each other. No one knows.
HANNAH
Maybe someone should go see if they
can find her.

JACOB
Oh, she's alright.

NEIL
I'm going to go for a jog, anyway.
I'll see if she's up this way.

JACOB
Don't you want to hear Hannah play?

NEIL
Of course, man. I'll hear her when
I get back. Maybe Elizabeth wants
to hear her, too.

JACOB
I doubt it.

Neil gets up and jogs away.

Tom, walk down the other way and
see if you see her.

JACOB

You don't have to do that. She's

alright.
ROSE

Tom!
JACOB

Don't go. She's my wife.
ROSE

Well then are you going to go?
JACOB

No. And Tom's not either.
ROSE

(to Tom)

Tom, you're the one that wanted to
go to the beach.

Tom looks at Jacob and then at Rose.
TOM
It's alright, I'll just be a

minute.

Tom gets up and walks away in the opposite direction that
Neil went.

JACOB

So are you going to play us a song

or did you just bring that thing

for show and tell?
Hannah starts to strum a few chords.
EXT. BEACH - SECLUDED AREA
Hannah's music continues.
Elizabeth lies on her back, on a towel, sunbathing, wearing
only a bikini. She's found a secluded spot surrounded by
rocks.
Tom emerges from the rocks. The sun beats down on him. He

squints and holds his hand up to his face to block the harsh
sun as he yells:

We were all... wondering... about
you.

Elizabeth lies back down, unconcerned.

ELIZABETH
Let'em wonder.

Tom moves closer to Elizabeth, looking back the way he came.
TOM
Well... then, I guess I'm going to
go back, since you're alright and
everything.

Tom stands nervously for a moment looking at Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH
Don't go.

TOM
What?

ELIZABETH

I said "don't go."
Tom stands, waits. Elizabeth still lies on her stomach,
motionless. The waves crash against the rocks and seagulls
soar overhead.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Tom. Sit down.

Tom looks around to see if anyone is watching. He sits down
next to Elizabeth.

EXT. BEACH

Hannah starts to sing a passionate song about unquenched
love.

Do you want to make love to me?

Tom swallows hard and freezes.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Well do you?

TOM
Y-yes.
ELIZABETH
--What?
TOM
(louder)
--Yes.

Tom watches as Elizabeth rolls over and sits up...
Elizabeth stares into Tom's eyes and...

leans forward and kisses Tom and...

Tom starts to kiss her back...

Hannah continues to sing. Jacob and Rose enjoy listening.
EXT. BEACH - SECLUDED AREA

Elizabeth pulls on Tom's shirt and Tom raises his arms so she

Elizabeth rolls off of Tom, pulls out a cigarette and lights
it.

Tom pulls his swimming trunks on as he stands, and he trips

scurries off between the rocks.

ELIZABETH
Tom, where are you going?

But Tom's gone.
EXT. BEACH - DAY

Tom stumbles back to the group.

A pile of beer cans sits in the middle of the blanket.
Everyone sits around (except, of course, Elizabeth).

JACOB
Talk about great marketing, there
must have been fifty different
flavors. There was Bubbelicious
and Bubble Yum and Hubba Bubba and

Bazooka...
ROSE
Yeah, with those cheesy little
comics...
Everyone laughs.
HANNAH
Yeah, but Hubba Bubba was the best--
NEIL
--Cause it wouldn't stick to your
face.
JACOB

--And it was the easiest to pick
off the bottom of the desks when
you got detention.

ROSE
I never got detention.

Me and Tom went into Sister Susan's

JACOB

--While I was in Mr. Walsh's
office.

NEIL

into her desk.

HANNAH
Limburg Cheese?

JACOB
Yeah, it works great. After about
two days it stinks to high hell.

HANNAH
A logical assumption.

JACOB
And they obviously couldn't tell'em
it was me.

TOM
--So we had to come in and clean it
up during our two day suspension.

NEIL
It wasn't that bad. At least we
got out of class.

ROSE
(to Hannah)
I told you it was stupid.

TOM
(to Hannah)
Remember... she broke up with me

right after it happened.

HANNAH
Oh, I do remember. That was night

Why don't you hang out? Everyone's

Elizabeth stares at Jacob, silent.

Shit. Take the fucking keys.

Jacob throws the keys up. Elizabeth catches them and walks
away.

Rose sashays across the living room to the delight of
everyone. She wears blue knee socks, a white shirt, and a
plaid, Catholic school girl skirt.

HANNAH
God! That is so gross.

The laughter continues.
HANNAH (CONT'D)

HANNAH
(imitating a man's voice)
That'll be "double trouble"
detention for you young lady.

And this makes everyone laugh even harder.

JACOB
Who was that?

HANNAH
That was Mr. Morton.

JACOB
That's right, I remember that guy.
He was a fucking weird-o.

HANNAH
Remember he made us memorize that
quote, "Sin is a demon crouching at

his fucking rocker. What ever
happened to him?

ROSE
He got fired.
HANNAH
Why?
ROSE
He slept with a student.

That old guy had a sex drive?
ROSE
Apparently. It was a little boy,
too.
HANNAH

He was gay?

JACOB
--Like you didn't know that?

HANNAH
--And how did you know?

JACOB
Just by looking at him. The guy
had a little sugar in his tank.

Tom enters with more beer and another pizza.
JACOB
Hey, Tom, did you know Mr. Morton
tried to fuck your wife?

Tom sets the pizza and beer down on the coffee table.

TOM
Oh, yeah. I never had his class.

Tom sits down at Rose's feet, beer in hand.

NEIL
Hey, man, I liked Mr. Morton.
Remember he used to ride his bike
to school?

ROSE
Even in the rain.

Hannah flips through the yearbook.

HANNAH
What ever happened to Sean O'Leary?

TOM
I saw him the other day, he's

She was so smart.

TOM

Sara Maguire?

HANNAH
Remember him? He's in L.A., too.
He's trying to be a screenwriter.

TOM
Mark Murphy?

Hannah nods.

JACOB
Has he written anything?

HANNAH

I think he just wrote this really
low budget "T and A" movie.

(looking back at the

Hannah's hand.

HANNAH
Sorry.

TOM
It's a pet name. Rose calls her
"Pan."

JACOB

What the fuck does it mean?

TOM
I don't know and they're never
going to tell you. I think I
figured out what "Bear" means
though.

Tom's a little drunk. Rose glances at Hannah, horrified.

TOM (CONT'D)

Her mom told me she used to collect
stuffed bears when she was a kid.

No. She was shot.
JACOB
Drugs?
ROSE

That's what everyone thinks but no
one's really sure. She was shot in

it was drug related.

No one moves.

No... it's ten times worse. You

week. And the pressure is...
intense. One fuck-up and you're
out, man. There's ten guys just
waiting to take your job.

Neil continues to look at the yearbook.

ROSE
Then why do you stay?

JACOB

Because I love it. I'm addicted to
it. The pressure makes me feel
alive. The ten guys waiting to
take my job keeps me sharp. Bring
the fuckers on. I make more money
in a year then my dad made his
whole life.

ROSE
Is the money really worth it?

JACOB

Oh, get off that horseshit. I'd do
it for free, but that's beside the
point, 'cause I love the money.
When those assholes hit my mother,
I got my lawyers on'em and fucking
buried'em. You think I would have

You wouldn't understand.

really love.

JACOB
Yeah, well, I love the "deal."

Rose shakes her head, annoyed.

HANNAH
Well then... I guess it's okay.
It's just- it's not for me. I'm

NEIL
Yeah, me neither. I kind of like
being poor. It's the kind of thing
that I'm going to be able to look

HANNAH
You know what I'm saying. We're

someone would hire us over a 22
year old fresh out of school.

That's why I went to Wall Street
right out of college.

it's not going to mean anything. He

their own?

HANNAH

I'm just saying, the devil has an
interest in people believing those
guys. Sure, they came up with the
ideas, but with whose help?

HANNAH
But it's not about God or the
Devil.

NEIL

But if you don't believe in the
devil, you don't believe in God
either. So satan wins.

story, but he wasn't happy either.

He ended up shooting himself in the

head.

HANNAH
And Nietzsche ended up dying of
syphilis that he contracted from a
prostitute.

NEIL
Exactly.

HANNAH
But they were all moral people,
with strict codes of conduct.

Tom appears in the doorway.

NEIL

Come on in and join us.
TOM

No... I got to go to bed.

Tom remains in the doorway.

HANNAH

(starting up again)
Look at the way you view
everything, like earlier when we
were talking about getting a "real"
job. I mean, you're over here
talking about how no one's ever too
old and about all the strength that
being poor is going to give you
when you're older.

NEIL
It is, I'm telling you.

HANNAH
Maybe it is, but it's like I'm over
here making lists of jobs I'm too
old to take, and- and what I'm
going to tell my parents, and
trying to make sure I never look
back at the experience with regret.
With me it's all very thought out
and... and concrete.

HANNAH (CONT'D)

And that's the thing, you're over
here, really vague and that's what
God is. Maybe he does exist, he
just isn't real... and if he does
exist he created me so I couldn't
believe in him.

NEIL
You see, though, you're not sure.

HANNAH
No, I'm not sure, and that's â€˜cause
I'm so concrete. No one can ever
be sure and if you are, it's only
because you're not as concrete as I
am.

Neil smiles at Hannah.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
You're still really searching and I
think you'll find his love. It's a
great feeling when you have a
personal relationship with Jesus
Christ. I just hope there's time.

Hannah shakes her head.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
If God does exist, and I face him,
and he condemns me, I'll spit in
his face and I'll go to hell
gladly. How can he condemn a
person that's moral?

NEIL
â€˜Cause you rejected his word, his
teaching. Jesus died for us on the
cross, and if you don't accept the
Lord as your saviour, man, that's
like saying, " I don't care that
you died for me on the cross. I
don't care that you sacrificed your
life for me." And Hannah he loves
you, and he wants to get to know
you better. You just got to want
to know him, too.

HANNAH
Well, then I'm going to hell. And

I won't be sorry, â€˜cause I made the
best choice I could.

You don't understand... I can't.

NEIL
Come on and pray with me right now.

Hannah shakes her head.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
Come on. If there's no God, how
can it hurt?

HANNAH
Â«+. Alright.

NEIL
All you got to do is ask him to
make himself known to you, and he
will, â€˜cause he loves you. Take my
hand.

Neil reaches out to Hannah and she takes his hand. Neil
closes his eyes, and Hannah does, too, and they begin to
pray.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)

God, I'm here with Hannah, and
she's searching, man, and she needs
you, and I would just ask you Lord,
to make yourself known to her,
because I know you and I know how
important your love is. Thank you
Lord. Amen.

HANNAH
Amen.

Neil opens his eyes and releases Hannah's hand.
NEIL
I wouldn't be surprised if you find
the Lord before the weekend's over.

Rose turns away from Tom. Tom stares at the ceiling.
INT. PATIO

Hannah and Neil continue their dialogue.

HANNAH
It's hard, just to say it, "I
don't believe in God." Like my

mother might overhear me and yell
at me or something. It's a hard
thing to do after 12 years of
Catholic schools.

NEIL
You know, I don't even go to the
Catholic church anymore. I don't
need a fancy expensive church to
worship the Lord. All I need is a
bible. Maybe you should try that,
just to get back to the word of the
Lord.

Neil maneuvers in toward the basket, Jacob guards him but
Neil fakes right and goes for an easy layup.

Jacob grabs the ball again, and throws it to Neil, hard.

JACOB
Fuck this shit.

And Neil goes around Jacob again but Jacob slams into him and
Neil misses the layup and Jacob steals the ball and shoots
from the outside. The basketball sails through the hoop.

Good morning.

EXT. PARK - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

Neil stands at mid-court, dribbling the ball. Jacob stands
in front of him, trying to guard him. Jacob leans forward,
staggers from exhaustion. Sweat pours off his face.

Neil cuts right, goes back left and Jacob trips and falls and
doesn't get up. Neil makes the easy layup.

TOM
No.

Jacob sits up and looks at Tom.

JACOB

You could have, you know?

I don't think so. We're thinking

You can't trust them with a ten

JACOB
A ten foot pole?

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - LATER
Tom stands on the basketball court listening to Neil.
NEIL

Shoot with your right hand. Use

It's the ultimate question facing
man. "Sin is a demon crouching at

Hannah sits on the ground, eating and drinking.

HANNAH
But it's not about good and evil.
There's no such thing!

When was the last time you read the

When was the last time you read
East of Eden? High school?

Neil doesn't answer.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
I'm just saying, that's not why
Morton had us memorize it.

JACOB
I just think it's open to
interpretation. Certainly God is
Good, so on the one hand it's
definitely about good and evil.

HANNAH
Morton didn't care about God. He
was an atheist

ROSE
How do you know that?

HANNAH
I talked to him about it. He took
that quote from Steinbeck's East of

Eden.

NEIL
And Steinbeck took it from the
bible.

HANNAH

Steinbeck found several different
translations of that one verse in
Genesis. And he found a
discrepancy in the final part of
the verse, "you will be mastered by
it, but you must master it."

TOM
What did it say?

HANNAH
One translation said, "thou shalt
rule over him." Which is a promise
from God, that man shall rule over
evil.

NEIL
Differences in translation don't
change the meaning.

HANNAH
But there is a difference.
ROSE
Let her finish.
HANNAH
He found another translation that
said, "Do thou rule over him." And

that's an order from God, for man
to rule over evil. Neither one
really gives anyone any choice, you
see? So Steinbeck went back to the
original hebrew and found one

word...
TOM
One word?
JACOB
What was it?
HANNAH
Timshel... and it meant, "thou
mayest." And this is very

different, it's not an order or a
promise, it's a choice, and it's
our choice. We may... but we also
may not. It's an offering of free
will, and it's about individual
responsibility and the invention of
consciousness. And that's what
Morton was talking about. He was
trying to tell us that we had a
choice, and not just between good
and evil, but with everything.

Tom repeats the word back to himself:

TOM
Timshel...

So you're an atheist?
HANNAH

++. Yeah.
ROSE

No, you're not.

HANNAH
What? It's not a bad word. It
doesn't mean I'm not moral. Some
of the brightest most moral people
in the world are atheists.

NEIL
We're just worried about you,
Hannah.

Hannah gets up and moves toward the house.

HANNAH

No wait. This is "Wonder Woman."

All eyes turn to Elizabeth as she stands up and sets her
dessert down and starts to spin around, and after a

HANNAH
I don't--

ELIZABETH
(interrupting)
--I know I wouldn't be happy being
poor.

Elizabeth turns away from Hannah, losing interest again. They
sit in silence for a moment and Hannah doesn't really know
what to say. So finally she starts to go inside.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
I guess it's just easier this way.

Hannah hears her and goes inside.
EXT. BACKYARD
Tom and Neil clean-up.

NEIL

See that's what she's missing. I
worry about her because she's my

friend.
TOM
You think she's going to hell?
NEIL
Yeah. Unless she makes some
changes.
TOM

I see your point but- but she's a
moral person.

NEIL
It doesn't matter, man. It's the
Lord. It's all in the bible.

Tom cracks another beer and sinks into a lawn chair.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
Why are you drinking so much?

TOM
I don't know. I just feel like
being a little drunk.

NEIL
Something bothering you?

No, it's the weekend. Time to cut

Tom stands up, declares:

TOM (CONT'D)
I better get to bed. I'm tired.

Tom picks up the garbage bags and moves toward the garage,
where the trash cans rest.

NEIL
If you want to talk more about the
Lord, I'm here.
Tom turns to him and nods and keeps going.
Neil goes inside.

EXT. PORCH

Elizabeth gets up and walks around the house toward the
backyard.

EXT. HOUSE

EXT. BACKYARD

Elizabeth arrives at the backdoor and goes into the patio.
INT. PATIO

Neil sits in the small wicker couch, reading the bible.

NEIL
Hey, Elizabeth. How's it going?

ELIZABETH
Fine.

Elizabeth takes a seat next to Neil.

NEIL
How was your shopping?

ELIZABETH
It was really, really good, Neil.

ELIZABETH
So you're living in...

NEIL
--San Francisco.

ELIZABETH
Do you like it?

NEIL
Yeah, there's a lot of good people
down there.

ELIZABETH
Are you dating anyone, Neil?

Elizabeth moves closer to Neil.

NEIL
Actually, yeah, there's this girl.
I'm just not sure about her. I got
to see if she thinks the same way I
do. She wears a cross around her
neck, but I don't know, man, I
think it might just be for show.

EXT. BACKYARD

Tom approaches the backdoor but he stops when he hears
Elizabeth's voice.

ELIZABETH (0.S.)
Don't you ever get lonely,
peddling, night after night?

INT. PATIO

Same scene; Elizabeth sits next to Neil.

NEIL
Lonely? No. I read a lot and stay
pretty busy with my church. There's
always work to do.

And now Elizabeth moves even closer to Neil.

NEIL
Yes- yes he can.

ELIZABETH
No, I don't think so.

And Elizabeth drops her hand onto Neil's leg. Neil moves
away, stands up and says without hesitation:

NEIL
No, I can't. And It's not â€˜cause I
don't want to, 'cause believe me, I
do, but-- but the vow of marriage
is sacred. You don't want to mess
that up.

ELIZABETH
Fuck you, Neil.

Elizabeth pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

EXT. PATIO

Tom Listens to Neil and a slight smile crosses his face.

NEIL (0.S.)
--I love you and Jacob too much. We
all have temptations in our life,
and by resisting them we can get
closer to God and- and this makes
us stronger.

INT. PATIO
Elizabeth stares hatefully at Neil, smoking her cigarette.

ELIZABETH
Neil, where do you get this shit?
NEIL

Elizabeth slams the door as she exits into the house. Neil's
head drops.

INT. LIVING ROOM
Hannah softly plays her guitar. Elizabeth storms past.
Neil enters, following Elizabeth.

NEIL
Elizabeth!

But Elizabeth's gone. Neil gives Hannah a smile of
resignation, almost embarrassment, and goes back out to the
patio.

And then Tom enters through the front door and also moves
quickly toward the stairs.

HANNAH
Good night, Tom.

Tom looks at Hannah, smiles but says nothing. He continues
up the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Light pours in from the hallway as Tom enters. Rose is
already in bed but wide awake.

Tom takes off his clothes and climbs into bed.

ROSE
What took you so long?

TOM
Elizabeth just made a pass at Neil.

Rose doesn't turn toward Tom.

ROSE
Yeah, of course. Who would want to
have sex with that bitch? Ugh,
she's disgusting.

TOM
Only the whole class of '87.

ROSE
No they wouldn't. Maybe in high
school but not anymore.

TOM
Come on Rose, you got to give Neil
a little credit.

ROSE
Tom, he's a loser, spouting off
that religious shit like he's so
much better than us. He's not even
Catholic anymore.

TOM
But it's not shit to him.

Rose turns toward Tom and looks him square in the face.

ROSE
Tom, what's gotten into you?

TOM
Nothing I- I just like Neil. Is
there anything wrong with that?

ROSE
Yes.
TOM
What?
ROSE
I don't care. You can like Neil if
you want.

Rose rolls back over.

ROSE (CONT'D)

ROSE
Well if you remember, don't wake me
up, â€˜cause I got to get some sleep.

INT. PATIO - NIGHT

Neil stands in the middle of the room ironing a pair of
pants. Hannah appears in the doorway wearing a revealing
night gown.

HANNAH
I'm impressed. Can you cook, too?

Neil turns around, startled. He notices Hannah's attire.

NEIL
Yeah. Hey, Hannah.

Hannah enters, sits down across from Neil, on the couch/bed.
Neil continues to iron his pants.

HANNAH
I'm so glad I got a chance to spend
some time with you, Neil. You've
really surprised me.

NEIL
Me. Why?

HANNAH
I always wondered what would happen
to guys like you. I guess I just
figured you'd be washed up after
high school. I guess I wanted to
believe it. I guess I had to...
â€˜cause I was just so miserable.

Neil stops ironing and sits down next to Hannah.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
That's the only way I made it;
thinking you guys were so immature
or- or not as smart as I was or...
or somehow not as deep. Like there
was a correlation between being
unpopular in high school and being
successful later in life. Like the
two somehow go together.

HANNAH (CONTâ€™D)
I had to cling to that 'cause I was

NEIL
You weren't unpopular.

HANNAH
No, maybe not unpopular, but I was
just such a nothing. No one even
knew who I was.

NEIL
I remembered you.

HANNAH
Yeah, and that was the first
surprise. But Jacob didn't
remember me. And that's the thing,
he's pretty much what I thought,
you know? He's successful and all,
I mean we all knew he would be, but-
but he hasn't really changed.

NEIL
Jacob is... Jacob.

HANNAH
That's why it's so good to see you,
and see that you actually have some
substance in your life. Not that
this means I agree with anything
you believe in, 'cause I don't,
but... but I do respect the hell
out of you.

Neil smiles and hugs Hannah and Hannah inhales deeply.

NEIL
Thanks Hannah.

But then Neil gets up and goes back to his ironing and a sad
smile crosses Hannah's face.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
Yeah, I don't know what I expected
of you, I guess you've amazed me,
too. I always thought you'd be
really successful. I remember, I
thought you were really smart.

Hannah quietly walks back into the living room.

Hannah?

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The living room light goes out, leaving the house in complete
darkness.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Hannah lies on the couch, asleep.
In the darkness a FIGURE appears, moving toward Hannah.

The figure kneels down next to Hannah and kisses her on the
lips and she starts to wake up. It's Jacob. She smiles when
she sees him in front of her. Jacob kisses her again and she
kisses him back but then she sits up and moves away.

HANNAH
No, I'm not going to do this.

JACOB
You're not going to do what?

Jacob sits next to her and tries to kiss her again but this
time she turns away.

HANNAH
I'm not going to do this.

JACOB
Come on. We've got to. Just to
see if it'll work. You're all I
think about since I got here...
day... and night.

Jacob moves in to kiss her and tries to cup one of her
breasts but Hannah moves further away. She smiles, almost
laughs. And this stops Jacob.

JACOB (CONT'D)
What? What's so funny?

HANNAH
If you had so much as said "hi" to
me in high school, I would have
been ecstatic for a year.

JACOB
Come on. Give me a break. I'm
trying to say "hi" now.

HANNAH
God. This is surreal. I never
thought I'd get this chance. And
I'm saying "no." I can, you know?
I never thought I'd be able to. But
I can.

JACOB
Hannah, listen, this is just
something we need. We'll figure it
out later. Let's just enjoy the
moment.

And again Jacob moves toward Hannah and Hannah moves further
away.

HANNAH
It's incredible, 'cause it's the
only way I would've ever really
known.

Now Jacob's growing a little agitated at Hannah's stalling.

JACOB
Known what?

HANNAH
I thought I could somehow redeem my
high school years by sleeping with
you. But it doesn't. High school
was High school. It's over.

JACOB
What the fuck are you talking
about?

HANNAH

I'm sorry that you were the one
that got caught in the middle of
this. But can't you at least see
what's happening, and be happy for
me?

Hannah covers Jacob's hand with her own and squeezes.

HANNAH
If I were to say "yes," it would
make the last ten years of my life
a complete waste. It's not about
going back and trying to fix it,
â€˜cause you can't, it's about
accepting it and moving forward.

And now Jacob's pulling away.

HANNAH (CONT'D)
(continuing)

I'm over you and I can finally put

high school behind me. It's not

about you, you know?

JACOB
Then what's it about?

HANNAH
It's about me, and who I am. And
now... I'm just not interested. I
don't know if I could have said
"no" even two days ago or... or two

minutes ago. But I can now, and it
feels so good.

JACOB
Hey, it's no big shit to me, I was
just talking about a roll in the
hay.
Jacob stands up.

HANNAH
I'm so sorry. It's not you.

JACOB
Jesus! Fucking tease.

Jacob storms out.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Morning sunlight filters in through the window. Tom lies in
bed. Rose is gone. Tom wakes up.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Tom enters wearing a bathrobe, still wiping the sleep out of
his eyes. Neil stands at the stove cooking eggs and bacon, a
few pieces of toast in the toaster. Neil wears sweats and
bounds around the kitchen full of energy.

NEIL
Good morning. Want some breakfast?

TOM
Yeah. That'd be great, thank you.

Tom sits down at the kitchen table.

TOM (CONT'D)
Where's Rose?

NEIL
She and Hannah went shopping. I

dress for tonight.

refrigerator, pulls out a beer.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
It's a little early to be drinking,
isn't it?

TOM
Yeah, I guess it is.

Tom sets the beer back into the refrigerator and sits back
down.

Neil continues to stretch. Finally, Tom says:
TOM (CONT'D)

You went out on a date with
Elizabeth, didn't you?

NEIL
Yeah, but it was before Jacob dated
her.

TOM

What happened?

NEIL
We had a really great time. She's
a great girl, but we weren't meant
to be together.

TOM
Did you have sex with her?
NEIL
No way, man. We just went out on
one date.

woman .

TOM

But you didn't... want to fuck her?
Neil looks at Tom, surprised.

TOM (CONT'D)
I saw you. Last night. Turn her
down.

NEIL
I wondered where you went.

TOM
I just can't believe you didn't
want to have sex with her.

Neil stands up and moves to the table with Tom.

NEIL
Let me tell you, man, I wanted to.
Sex is great. When I get married,
I'll probably be spending 60% of my
time in the bedroom. But outside
of marriage, it just doesn't work.
God created sex to remain in
marriage. Look what's happening to
all the gay people. I'm not saying
that God created AIDS to kill them,
but it's just like "look, nothing
good comes out of sex when it's not
in marriage."

TOM
You don't have sex anymore?

NEIL
No way, man. Look, in college I
didn't care. I would tell anything
to a girl just to get her in bed.
And girls believed it, and I
hurt'em. I'd tell them that I
loved them, and they believed it.

When was the last time?
NEIL
It's been... almost four years. And

it's great. I think I've slowly
regained some of my virginity, and
I'll keep regaining it as long as
I'm faithful to the Lord. The
Lord's got a plan for all of us,
you just got to believe in him.
He's probably already got someone
picked out for me. And I have a
feeling it's this girl I'm working
with. She could be the one, man.

Jacob enters. Moves quickly to the refrigerator.

JACOB
We got any more beer?

Jacob sees the beer in the refrigerator and pulls one out.

JACOB (CONT'D)
You want one?

Tom looks at Neil

TOM
No thanks.

JACOB
You ready to go?

Jacob pulls the Limburg cheese out of the refrigerator.

No. It's over. She doesn't want
me anymore.

NEIL

Are you kidding me? It's not over,

man. The love that you feel is
enough to bring her back and make

you stronger. You can't just give

up, Man. Not now. She needs you.

97.

Tom sits... waits... finally turns toward Hannah, says:

TOM
What does "Bear" mean?

Hannah shakes her head.

HANNAH
Tom, I...

TOM
--What does it mean?

HANNAH
--I'm sorry.

TOM
--Did Jacob fuck her in Walsh's
office?

HANNAH
--No.

TOM

(half yelling)

Did he?

HANNAH

Yes. He did... He fucked her in
Walsh's office, when you guys were
in Sister Susan's office. She

followed him in there and... they
did it. It was supposed to be me.

Tom closes his eyes as it sinks in and falls back in the

couch.

TOM
God, we were so young then.

Silence.

HANNAH
Tom, we're young now.

INT. JACOB'S CAR - NIGHT

Parked in a secluded spot, Jacob and Rose look into the
night.

JACOB
It's been a hell of a weekend.
ROSE
Yeah, I'll say.
JACOB
You know, I think about you all the
time.
ROSE
Me too.

(correcting herself)
I mean, I think about you, not me.
I don't think about me.

JACOB
I know what you meant.
(and)
My life is just so... complicated.

ROSE
You're not the only the one. My
life was enough of a soap opera
before any of this.

JACOB
Yeah, see... that's why I'm glad we
got this chance to talk before I
left.

ROSE
... Before we leave?

JACOB
I don't want this to end like it

did in high school, but it's got to
end.

ROSE
--Oh...

JACOB
The timing is all wrong. Me and
Elizabeth, I guess we're just going
through something. I hope I didn't
mislead you.

Rose takes a deep breath and starts to speak but her voice
cracks and she stops and takes another deep breath.

She starts to speak again and her voice continues to crack
but she keeps going anyway, and she's fighting back tears:

ROSE
No- no, I- I don't care. We're not
kids anymore. I guess me and Tom
are going through something, too.
Our relationship is- is so strong,
you and Elizabeth could never
understand what me and Tom have...

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Finished with her own clothes, Elizabeth throws Jacob's
clothes into another suitcase.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Tom and Neil still sit on the couch. Hannah still sits
across from them.

TOM
What does the bible say about this?
NEIL
A lot.
(and)
Come on Tom, take my hand and pray
with me.

Tom takes Neil's hand.

NEIL (CONTâ€™D)
Do you want to be born again? Right
now?

Tom takes a deep breath and nods, "yes." Neil closes his
eyes but Tom's eyes remain open and fastened to Hannah and

Neil takes a deep breathe and starts to speak but Hannah
interrupts.

HANNAH
(interrupting)
Timshel...

Hannah's word hangs in the air and Tom's looking right at
her.

TOM
--What?

Hannah gets up and starts moving toward Tom and Neil.

HANNAH
Don't. Don't just retreat to
religion.

NEIL

Knock it off, Hannah. He needs our
support. He needs the Lord.

Hannah sits on the couch. Tom now sits between Neil and

Hannah.
HANNAH
This is what Morton was talking
about! "Timshel."
NEIL

--Hannah, this is not the time.

HANNAH
Tom, you got to choose for
yourself. You don't have to do
what Neil says. You don't have to
do what Rose says. You don't have
to do what your parents said. You
should do what you want.

NEIL
Hannah, please.
HANNAH
(to Neil)

If God exists, fine, but let him
find out for himself.

NEIL
Hannah, you said you respected me.

I just want him to do the same
thing.

HANNAH
But for you it's different, for you
it's a choice. You're choosing for
Tom.

NEIL
--But we're going to be doing the
same thing.

HANNAH
No, it's not. If two people do the
same thing for different reasons,
it's not the same thing.

Neil thinks for a moment, staring at Hannah.

NEIL

But then he's just doing what you

say. How's that any different?
HANNAH

Maybe it's not, maybe it's a

paradox. But maybe trying is all

anyone can do.

And the door opens and Rose appears in the doorway.

Elizabeth enters with the suitcases and exits out the front
door without saying a word.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Elizabeth exits the house, walks to Jacob's car. Jacob still
sits in the drivers seat. He watches as Elizabeth
approaches.

JACOB
Well?

ELIZABETH
Well what? Open the trunk.

Jacob pops the trunk. Elizabeth throws the suitcases into
the trunk and gets into the car.

JACOB
You know, this is as much their
fault as it is ours.

Elizabeth stares hatefully at Jacob.

JACOB (CONT'D)
Shit!

Jacob starts the engine, backs the car out of the driveway
and they drive away.

INT. KITCHEN
Tom and Rose sit at the table. Finally Rose speaks.

ROSE
He hasn't changed one bit. How
could we let him stay here?

TOM
I don't know.

ROSE
Tom, I made a mistake. I think we
both made a mistake and- and I want
to be the first one to apologize.

TOM
Do you love him?

ROSE
No, of course not.

TOM
So- so what do you want to do?

ROSE
We've been together for so long. I
think what we have is too valuable
to just throw away without even
trying.

Tom inhales deeply and stares at Rose.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Tom, talk to me, tell me how you're
feeling. We've both been on an
emotional rollercoaster this
weekend. This isn't going to just
go away but- but maybe we can grow
beyond it. Maybe?

And tears start to grow in Rose's eyes.

ROSE (CONT'D)
(continuing)

I mean, we could go on and punish
ourselves for what we've done, but
I just feel like I want to go back
to the way things were before any
of this, before this God-awful
weekend.

Tom sighs, says:

TOM
Me, too.

Rose covers Tom's hand with her own and now she's crying.

ROSE
Most people don't have half of what
we have. I mean, I know Jacob and
Elizabeth will never even be close.
And we were willing to throw it all
away. And for what?

TOM
I don't know.

ROSE
I love you, Tom. And at least now
I know, if Jacob were to make a
pass at me now, I would be able to
turn him down, and- and maybe it's
the same for you with Elizabeth?
Tom Nods. Rose waits for an answer.

TOM
It is.

Rose wipes the tears out of her eyes and they embrace.
ROSE
(crying)
Are we going to this God-damn
reunion?
Tom nods and hugs Rose back.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Rose and Tom enter, holding hands.

ROSE
We're going to the reunion.
Together.
Neil and Hannah glance at each other.
NEIL
Well, that's great. See, man, I
told you could work things out.

Neil slaps Tom on the arm. Tom smiles faintly but doesn't
look at Hannah.

INT. BEDROOM
Rose enters, a towel wrapped around her body, hair wet.

ROSE
Why aren't you getting ready?

Tom sits on the bed.

TOM
I will.

ROSE
We got to leave in ten minutes.

TOM
I know.

Rose moves to the closet and begins to get dressed.

ROSE
I'm so glad they left.

Rose starts to put on her dress. She looks at herself in the
mirror.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Do you think this dress makes me
look fat?
Tom doesn't answer. He's still sitting on the bed.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Tom? Why aren't you getting ready?

TOM
I am.

Tom starts to untie one of his shoes. Rose goes back to
putting on her dress.

ROSE
Why didn't you tell me Jacob
offered you a job in New York?

TOM
I- I guess I didn't have time.

ROSE
He says New York is pretty nice. I
don't think it's like other cities.
Maybe we should go to New York. I
mean, it'd be a lot more money.

Tom stops fiddling with his shoe and looks at Rose with some
real surprise.

TOM
You- you want to go to New York?

ROSE
Maybe. I think we should
definitely think about it.

Rose looks at Tom. He's still sitting on the bed looking
back at her.

ROSE (CONT'D)
What's wrong?

TOM
If we had wanted to go to New York,
we should have gone 10 years ago. I
thought we wanted to stay here.

ROSE
You don't want to go to New York?
TOM
That's not the point. I- I don't
know what I want... I want to find

out what I want.
ROSE
Maybe that's something we need to
work on, but I don't think that's
any reason to pass up this
opportunity.
Tom remains on the bed.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Do you?

Tom shakes his head.

ROSE (CONT'D)
We'll talk about this later.

Tom stands up and starts to walk toward the door.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Tom! Where are you going?

TOM
I haven't any idea.

Tom freezes and looks at Rose and tries to gather his
strength.

TOM (CONT'D)
I- I'm not going. Maybe if I hurry
I can make it to the twentieth
reunion.

ROSE
Tom, wait a minute. How was I
supposed to know what New York was
like? I've never been there
either. I didn't know.

Tom looks blankly at Rose.

ROSE (CONT'D)
Well? How was I supposed to know?
Just tell me how I was supposed to
know? I don't see what you're
getting so upset about.

TOM
I'm not upset.

ROSE
Well, then how can you leave? I
think you owe me a little more than
that. I thought we were going to
try and make this work?

TOM
(trying to clear his
throat)
... Timshel.

ROSE
What?

And now Tom says it louder and it hits Rose hard:

Timshel!

And the word seems to physically stop Rose.

ROSE
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?

TOM

I don't know.
And Tom exits.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Neil and Hannah watch as Tom passes through.

NEIL
Where are you going?

Tom gets to the door and looks back at Neil and Hannah.

TOM
I don't know.

Tom exits. Hannah looks at Neil and then runs into the
hallway.

INT. BEDROOM
Rose lies on the bed, crying. Hannah enters and sits on the
bed, and wraps her arm around Rose and Rose's crying

increases.

HANNAH
Oh, Rose, I'm sorry.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Rose sleeps. Hannah gets up and kisses Rose on the forehead
and exits.

ROSE
Goodnight.

Rose breathes deeply, sleeps.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Neil waits on the couch. Hannah enters.
