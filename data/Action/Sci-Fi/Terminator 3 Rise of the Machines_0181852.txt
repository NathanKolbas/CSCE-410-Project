Sunbathers stretch out along the sand which offers a Queen’s

Necklace view of the coast. it’s a clear summer day with

Catalina Tsland in view. ‘Jolleyball players, surzers,

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH - UNDERWATER - SUNSET

The same spot as before, except now it’s an apocalyptic hell
beneath the sea. Skulls roll back and forth on the polluted
sea floor as the tide churns. The camera rises out of the
water and finds a polluted sea wave which crashes onto 4
coastline. In the distance, fragments of large buildings,
buckled and melted by the nuclear fire. Furious gaie winds
scream with Satan’s laughter.

the war called Judgment Day, lived on to
toast the new millennium.
(beat)

But are we at peace? Or in the eye of a
hurricane, with the worst yet to come.

Camera turns and faces the deep blue sea...

Wild fingers of blue and white electrical arcs dance ten feet
above the swells a mile from shore. The strange lightning
forms a circular opening in midair, and with an electrical
dispersion we see a FIGURE cradled within the SPHERE OF
ENERGY. A sudden FLASH with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!

The naked figure drops into the ocean. SPLASH!

UNDERWATER

Red eyes glow within the darkness of the sea. A naked,
muscular man. THE TERMINATOR.

RAPPER
Get that shit fixed! Holding up the
party.

Two BODY GUARDS move fix to the problem...

All action stops as a very muscular NAKED MAN climbs onto the
yacht, dripping wet. TERMINATOR steps aboard. Greek-like
physique. Massive. Perfect. Face, devoid of emotion.
Terminator stands and impassively surveys the surroundings.

PARTIER #1
I think he was swimming for the nude
beach and got lost.

Rapper eye-balls the naked Goliath -- not an everyday
occurrence here. He glances down at Terminator’s crotch,
smirking.

Rapper tenses.

RAPPER
Throw this bitch off my boat.

Body Guard #1 reaches grabs Terminator’s upper arm.

BODY GUARD #1
Say bye-bye.

Terminator’s powerful hydraulic grip clamps onto his arm,
spin-breaks it. Body Guard #1 cries out as all two hundred
pius pounds of him is catapulted off the ship like a frisbee.
Splash!

Body Guard #2 slashes his combat knife toward Terminator who
catches it by the razor-sharp serrated edge, breaks the blade
in half by pressing his thumb forward...throws the blade
straight down where it stabs the mahogany deck. Terminator
grabs Body Guard #2 and throws the soldier onto the blade
which sticks through his shoulder.

Body Guard #3 extends a .9mm to shoot... Terminator grabs the
weapon and yanks, separating Body Guard #3’s shoulder. While
screaming in pain, Body Guard #3 is launched through the
cabin window...CRAASSH! At the same time...

Two other Body Guards blast Terminator with their .9mms.
Terminator barely flinches from the onslaught, bullets
ricocheting off his face.

CRACK! Terminator steps on Body Guard #4’s knee sideways...
SNAP! Screaming bloody murder, Body Guard #4 goes for his
pistol which is just in his reach: until... Terminator steps:

A combat knife slices across Terminator’s neck from behind.
Terminator back~head-butts Body Guard #5, strips the blade
and throws it with machine-like accuracy...

THONG! The knife spears through Body Guard #6’s wrist,
pinning it to the wall of the cabin -- the HK MP-5, frozen in
his grip, is fired accidently, blasting two dry-docked WAVE
RUNNERS which explode IN A BALL OF GASOLINE! Fire spreads.

RAT-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-! A Body Guard explodes multiple rounds of
an MP-5. Terminator strips the clip out of the weapon,
making it CLICK EMPTY. Body Guard #7 is hurled hard against
the cabin wall. SMASH!

The injured Body Guards stop attacking. They get it --
There’s something very fucking wrong here.

Terminator, the fear of God in chem.

The MD-520N flies right through the flames and continues
toward the shore, leaving the fiery aftermath behind.

CUT TO:
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - PIN SET-UP AREA - NIGHT

Magnificent tendrils of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT explode like a
massive Tesla Coil. The lower half of bowling pins are
partially disintegrated as a mathematically perfect sphere
cuts into our dimension, bringing with it a passenger from
the future.

Camera slowly tilts up...revealing:

Feet. Petite and delicate. Slender ankles. Sculpted calfs.
Long sturdy thighs. Small waist. Toned arms. Beautiful tan
skin. Silky hair just past shoulder length. Eyes sizzling
brightly with emerald green. Bee-stung lips. Flawless face
structure. Genetically perfect, impossibly beautiful. Meet
Skynet’s newest prototype -~- T-1G.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LANES

A BOWLER dries his hands, wiggling his fingers above a fan as
he waits for the pins to set-up. : : .. ces,

The automatic pin set-up machine lowers ten deformed pins,
all of ‘which have been mutilated by the sphere. The pins
tumble to the lane, unable to stand on their own.

The Yuppie reacts as he got a STRIKE without having to do
anything:

VOICE (OS)
What the hell...

Just then, all eyes feast on T-1G who struts across the lanes
like a runway supermodel -- COMPLETELY NAKED.

A MOTHER covers her son’s bulging eyes. Beer-drinking
Bowlers straighten their greasy hair as the girl of their wet
dreams approaches.

Well, well, well... Happy birthday to me!
771G walks past several jealous women and their gawking
poyEriends and husbands when a MANAGER approaches with a
blanket.

MANAGER
Miss, you’re gonna have to put some
clothes on, or I'll call the cops.

The Manager throws the blanket around T-1G, covering her up.
“Boos” from the other bowlers.

iNT. MANAGER’S OFFICE
The Manager escorts T-1G inside.

MANAGER
So what is this, some kind of dare?
What’s going on here?

T-1G turns her emotionless eyes on the Manager, coldly
considering him. The blanket falls off, curls on the floor
by her feet. The Manager smirks.

MANAGER (CONT’ D)
Have it your way.

T-1G reaches out and slides her hand down his chest,
seductively descending lower... The Manager smiles.

T-1G’s hand wraps around a CELLPHONE which the Manager wears
on a belt clip. She spins around, flips open the phone and
begins dialing. : a re Se :

The Manager reaches out and grabs T-1G’s shoulder. Big
mistake. T-1G spins around and grabs the Manager’s neck. He
suddenly GASPS as he is electrocuted with a lethal dose of
amperage! Eyes peeled wide in horror, the Manager hits the
floor. Dead.

COMPUTER FAX TONES are heard through the cellphone as it
accesses the internet. With her back turned to CAMERA, T-1G
replies with computer tones.

T-iG ends the call. Her eyes focus on a large poster tacked
; to a wall. A glamorous supermodel dressed in PRADA and
- GUCCI, pseudo military-industrial. Black Prada stretch
pants. Tight-fitting techno-fiber motorcycle jacket with a
hint of military. Sleek Gucci combat boots. A ten thousand
dollar outfit. The model’s hair is short and slicked back.
High-fashion makeup, pale with dark shading around the eyes.
Very modern.

T-16's nails suddenly take on red paint. Her body ripples as
it morphs into its new look. Perfectly emulating clothes,
hair and makeup -- all from visual reference.

EXT. BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

T-1G exits with her new look. Her eyes fall on a Shelby
Cobra stripped of paint. She enters the vehicle and fires up
the powerful engine. _
Wheels burn black smoke as the muscle car shimmies sideways,
waiting for cold rubber to heat up and grip. When they
finally do, T-1G rockets the Cobra onto the street.

CUT TO:
EXT. PARK - DAY

A BBQ party is in progress. Grunge music blasting. Working
the grill wearing a “Kiss The Chef” apron is JOHN CONNOR. A
far cry from the leader of the human resistance we expect to
see. He has become a handsome young adult in his early
twenties. Lean, well-defined body, short messed-up hair.
Eyes which reflect a dark intelligence.

T-iG removes a gun and cocks it. An ALARM WAILS!

SUDDENLY, the paintings on two walls swing open, revealing 2
HUGHES 30mm CHAIN GUNS. A BOOBY-TRAP!

An EXPLOSIVE BARRAGE of gunfire blasts T-1G! Each
penetrating bullet exits the opposite side of her body,
narrowly stretching out her skin in the diameter of the
bullet. As T-1G is continuously blasted, her distorted form
takes on a porcupine effect. The long, skinny spinules the
bullets created grow luminous with grainy static —- like
static snow on a television. This glowing static emits high-
pitched frequencies with each bullet hit.

As T-1G is blasted more and more, her body dissipates into a
fog of static energy and eventually disappears.

The 30mm CHAIN GUNS run out of ammo and click empty.
Silence.

Seconds later, a beautiful geometric aura of static
electricity appears -- like an angel floating in a glow of
radiant color. Granules of static energy return to their
shape and rebuild T-1G, returning her to her gorgeous self --

Terminator descends the other side of the sloped tunnel wall

cranks the bike right, CRASHING through several wooden planks
which read -- END OF CONSTRUCTION.

Anna hits the brakes hard. -Both tires lock. But the

T-1G catches the bike like she was thrown a ball, tosses back

at Terminator. Terminator ducks as the bike impacts the

T-1G runs at Terminator. SMASH! The rock walls of the

drives his fists into her repeatedly. But his fists move
through her as her form turns to static energy. It’s as if
Terminator is battling a ghost. In this mode, T-1G can’t be
injured, nor can she injure.

Terminator swings his arms through the static energy gas, but
with no effect.

T-1G turns into a static fog, then DISAPPEARS. Where'd she

T-1G turns her back to the Cyber Cellar and stands directly
in front of the vault door, silent and still -- a sentinel
guarding Satan‘s throne.

CUT TO:
INT. SECURITY SURVEILLANCE ROOM

Terminator rips open the door. John and the rest of the gang
cile in and face the many security monitors.

John sits before the computers, punching up different
locations on the monitors.

One of the screens shows the interior of a fully automated
ROBOTIC FACTORY where T-ls are constructed. It’s in full
operation. A new T-1 steps off the production line and is
equipped with ammo-pack and chain gun.

COL. BELL
Well that answers that. Fucking

JOHN

John types into the computer. The Cyber Cellar comes up on
the main large-screen monitor. Standing in the control booth
outside the Cyber Cellar is the T-1G standing guard.

One of the soldiers speaks up. - -

COL. BELL

Terminator turns back to John, hearing his new idea.

JOHN
The communication cables beneath the

Cyber Cellar. How exactly were they
installed?

COL. BELL
Automated boring technology.

John shines with epiphany. He marches up to Terminator with
a big smile.

JOHN

working.

TERMINATOR , :

INT. UNDERGROUND MAINTENANCE FACILITY ~ LOW LIGHT

Terminator pulls a dusty canvas tarp off a single-manned
boring machine, otherwise known as a “DIGGER.”

John, Sarah and the rest of the soldiers huddle around the
digger, examining it closely. Torpedo-sized, covered with
rows of tiny blades. Connected to the aft section is a iong
spool of fiber optic cabling. Gaff reaches out and touches

one of the many tiny blades, cuts his finger, sucks the
wound.

COL. BELL
You realize the floor to the Cyber

INT. UNDERGROUND - R.U.S.T. SYSTEM - LOW LIGHT

Sparks illuminate the newborn tunnel as the digger bores
through. Like a SCUBA diver being pulled through the water
by a JET-SUB, John digs through. The HK69 grenade launcher
slung around his shoulder, John hangs onto the aft~-cable

spool mount with both hands, his stomach skidding across the
ground.

The entire floor is thick titanium except for a circular
opening (12 feet in diameter) where thousands of optical

EXPLOSION of sound as the cables BURST. Sparks shower the
oor as the digger CUTS UP through the cabling, penetrating
the basement of the Cyber Cellar.

Sarah, Col. Bell and the rest of the soldiers keeps guard. A
noise catches Sarah's attention. She looks up, sees a video
camera. It’s red recording LIGHT begins BLINKING. Sarah
spins around, hyper-alert.

SARAH
We got company! ~

London suddenly fights as something grabs his hand and forces
his pistol against his own temple. BANG!

Gaff spins around, gun leveled. CRACK! His head is hyper-
rotated.

Col. Bell begins shooting wildly. Until his body is thrown
so hard into the metal wall....instant death.

Sarah fires a constant stream of ammo until her gun is yanked
from her grip by something unseen. Her body is slammed into
a wall. Then suddenly, her feet lift off the ground as she
is slide up the wall by the unseen force. Her face smears
blood as she slides upward.

T-1G exits camouflage mode and appears. She stands on the
wall, defying gravity, looking directly into Sarah’s ‘eyes.
Fisting Sarah’s hair, T-1G points Sarah’s eyes into her’s.

T-1G
Where’s John Connor?

T-1G studies Sarah’s NEURO-ELECTRIC ACTIVITY: Among
cluttered images, subconscious dialogue overlaps: “Go to

T-1G reacts as Sarah’s unusual mental strength.

Terminator stops. Listens. He shoves John aside just as...

INT. HANGAR

Because of the angle of SWIFT lying on its side, John is
catapulted at a 45 degree angle across the length of the
hangar. A parachute opens just before he hits the ground,
breaking his fall somewhat.

T-1G jumps out of the aircraft, eyes targeting John.

John backs away from the approaching T-1G when suddenly her
body starts twitching strangely.

T-1G tries to shake it off when a strange vibration ripples
through her. The vibration grows...and like a microphone
feeding back, a single tone crescendoes...louder...louder...
into an ugly deafening ROAR.

T-1G examines herself as her body swells and unravels, her
dense sentient frequency matter decompressing -- it’s not
pretty. Her arms and chest burst open, ballooning out
massively. Legs explode, rapidly growing outward as her
insides pour out of her. T-1G’s gorgeous smooth skin is now
replaced with her inner-working, intricate neural network now
visible. Tendrils of neural tissues rip open and writhe as
they try to re-connect.

John backs into a corner, trapped by T-1G.

T-1G finally stabilizes. She is now grossly misshapen and
horribly contorted. Arcs of electricity blaze through her
augmented form which lays paralyzed upon the ground, just
feet from John; her stillborn eyes boring into his. Body
rippling with electricity.

John struggles to his feet, and hurries past the hideous
machine -- smart not to assume she’s dead.

With some difficulty, Terminator stands. There’s a moment of
refreshing silence...

TERMINATOR (CONT! D)

John and Terminator move to exit when...

Suddenly T-1G CRASHES through the wall and rears its massive
physique. Her beautiful features, although still
recognizable, undulate with grotesque proportion. John has
created an even worse adversary!

Terminator levels the chain gun and blasts rounds into her.
The effect of the gunshots have a slight damaging effect for
the first time -- in this state T-1G is more vicious, but
perhaps more vulnerable.

John races to escape through the corridor, Terminator
trailing with a limp. T-1G rips apart the walls, having
difficulty squeezing its cumbersome new body through. This
slowing her down greatly.

Terminator blasts T-1G with his chain gun until...CLICK. Out
of ammo. John finds a door to a stairwell.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Come on!

INT. STAIRWELL - EMERGENCY LIGHTING

The sprinkler system showers John and Terminator as they
rapidly descend the steps. The T-1G crashes inside, fighting
to squeeze through, shaking the interior like a 9.0
earthquake.

The stairwell crumbles beneath John’s feet, causing him to
plummet a flight. WHAM! John hits hard, writhing in pain.

T-1G lurches downward toward John when Terminator steps in
between. Like a cobra, T-1G strikes at Terminator.
Retaliating, Terminator punches holes into T-1G. But as his
arms rip into her, human flesh is instantly burned off by the
acidic effect of the neurai inner-workings.

Terminator falls down a flight, lands beside John. T-16
crashes through the stairwell, forcing its large body toward
its prey, bashing apart chunks of concrete.

Terminator spies an air conditioning duct. With endoskeleton
exposed arms, he rips off the metal covering and shoves John
inside. Terminator dives in after John.

Terminator’s servos and hydraulics grind and sputter horribly
as he tries to move.

Terminator’s red left eye dims, losing its bright glow. The

much too heavy to move.

John hears the horrible screech of T-1G which echoes through
the air duct above. Time is running out.

Terminator smiles sarcastically before his body begins
sizzling with short bursts of blue electricity and the
glowing red from his mechanical eyes fade.

Debris rains down from above as T-1G grows nearer.

John crawls across the grated floor toward a CONTROL ROOM.
Illuminated by strobed emergency lighting...A 35 foot PLASMA

T-1G violently rips through the claustrophobic confines of
the duct, cutting viciously through the wall, clearing enough
space to squeeze through.

T-1G drops down into the large chamber and whips its head
toward John who is seen climbing inside the control room,
protected behind ultra thick glass.

Terminator latches onto T-1G with one hand and grabs the
metal grates with his other, keeping the beast _pinned. T-1G
fights to free herself.
