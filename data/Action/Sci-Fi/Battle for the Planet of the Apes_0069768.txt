THE BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES

Working Title

First Draft Story Outline
by

PAUL DEHN

July 5, 1972
We rove Modern City's Civic Center soon after sunrise, Its
otherwise deserted streets (over which we SUPER the date
"2004 A.D,“) are being prepared for some sort of festivity
by groups of early WORKERS: human males in red, females in
blue. We watch:

- Group 1 hosing down a sidewalk,
- Group 2 sweeping clean behind Group 1, and passing:

- Group 3 brushing adhesive “size” on the back of a

poster held face downwards on a cafe tabletop.

- Group 4 attaching a furled fleg to the base of a

flagpole,

- Group 5 scrubbing (and masking) the plinth of a stone
statue, whose shoes only are visible below the hem of
a sculpted robe. A loudening drum-roll, as the Scrubbers
step back to reveal the plinth's inscription: "CAESAR I",

Then triurphal MUSIC crashes in over a CUT TO:

The flag unfurling in the wind as it reaches the mast-head,
Against a yellow ground, the head of an Ape (CAESAR) rises
from syrbolically blood-red flames, Over the flag, as it

flutters, we SUPER MAIN TITLE:
“BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES"

and CUT TO:
2.
- Group 3 affixing the poster to the wall. It bears the
Same device as the flag, but the head is profiled and
subscribed: "HAIL, CAESAR"
cUT TO:
- Dramatic shot of the statue's head, Imperial Caesar
looks down on his subjects, one of whom (a human male)
is climbing up a ladder to scrub the great stone face -

from which, as he scrubs, we CUT TO:

Caesar's own face. A human hand is combing his hair and beard,
We PULL BACK to reveal Caesar seated in a futuristic "robing-
room" before a tall mirror. He is attended by his red-uniformed
VALET, who now ceases his ministrations and steps back to
otserve the reflected result,
CAESAR
Thank you, George.
As Valet backs out of shot, MACDONALD (Caesar's Negro overseer
in "CCNQUVEST") moves into the mirror and stands behind the
Chimpanzee who is now his raster. We shall learn that he is
the only Human in Modern City permitted to wear clothes rather
than a servant's uniform,
MACDONALD
Your escort is ready, Caesar, and
the Council is assembled,
Outside, in @ long interior corridor, two armed, black-uniformed

Gorilla GUARDS spring to attention and salute as Caesar regally
3.
emerges, followed by Macdonald. The Group moves off through
a MONTAGE of interior corridors. Minor Ape Officials, encountered
en route, give place with that slight inclination of the head
which serves for a royal bow in England. The few Human Workers
back away more obsequiously and bow lower. During this, we

SUPER:

MAIN CREDITS

And as CREDITS END, we reach great double-doors on which

Macdonald ceremonially knocks, Over the doors opening, CUT TO:

REVERSE LONG SHOT (from inside the Council Cnamber) of doors
flung open by huran SERVAKTS,
MACDONALD
Pray silence for Caesar!

He gives place, as Caesar enters and the Councilors rise from

either side of a long table. They are:

- 3 CHIMPANZEES led ty PAN* who is young, intellectual
and idealistic. The speed of his talk reflects the
speed of his mind; and his mind is all peace between

Apes and humans,

~ 3 GORILLAS led by ALDO, who is early-middle-aged,
aggressive, militeristic, hates Humans and would like

them exterminated - if necessary by war.

- 2 ORANGUTANS led by ZENO, who is the elderly apostle of

science and reason. It takes him longer than the others

 

* Tha endoantifie nare for the species Chimpanzee.
4,
to form a conclusion; but the conclusion, once reached,
is always more practical than Pants and more logical

than Aldots.

The Orangutans are a minority faction, but their two votes in
Council can be decisive in the event of a deadlock between the
three Chimpanzees and three Gorillas. We must watch Zeno.

At the picture's end, he will become the Lawgiver retrospectively
referred to in "PLANET". In the SCREENPLAY we shall more fully
establish the character and viewpoint of each faction-leader
during the brief debate that follows Caesar's opening statement.

Meanwhile, all Councilors resume their seats for:

CAESAR
Fellow Chimpanzees, Gorillas and
Orangutans! On this thirteenth
annjversary of the Night of the Fires,
I have (as is our annual custom)
assembled and collated reports from
all territories on the state of Ape
Supreracy; and I now announce with
pride that ninety percent of Mankind
is under Ape domination and control,

A growl of approval, as the Gorillas' hairy hands slap the

tabletop. Macdonald remains impassive.

CAESAR
There are still isolated pockets of
human resistance in the north = but
I stress that they are isolated and
therefore constitute no serious threat
provided that they remain scattered,
until we have rounded them up and
disarmed them.

Macdonald just perceptibly sighs.
5.

CAESAR

(looking at him)
Disarmament of their minor weapons
continues. Disarmament of their
major weapons appears complete. We
shall use the former only for our
own defence ~- and the latter will
never be reactivated,

(to Councilors)
The world may breathe again. It
cannot now be destroyed by those who
walk upon it, Thirteen years after
the Night of the Fires, we stand upon
the brink of an Era of Peace.

Only the Gorillas take no part in applause which is punctuated

by murmurs of "Peace!" from the rest. Then, softly but audibly:

MACDONALD
And goodwill, Caesar?

CAESAR
(puzzled)
Towards whom?

MACDONALD
Towards Men.

A pinedrop silence, broken by Aldo, who spits.
CAESAR
You have our goodwill, provided you
keep our laws.
ALDO
(snorting)
What more do you want? A seat on
our Council?

MACDONALD
Yes,

Another silence, Then, successively, Aldo, GORILIA 1 and
GORILLA 2 laugh... and laugh.
MACDONALD

(interrupting)
I have seen to it that we have served
you quietly, faithfully and efficently
for more than a decade, We have put
not only our energies at your disposal
but our knowledge. God gave you brains.
We have given you minds. You still need
us. Yet we have no representation on
your Council,

ALDO
Because it is our Council.

PAN
(rising)
It is not our Council but the Community's,
And I do not see why Humans, who share
this Community in however humble and
subordinate a capacity, should not derand
at least one seat on ~

ZENO
(rising)
Demand or deserve?

MACDONALD
I have said that we have served you
peacefully for more than ~

ZENO

(sardonic)
Ten years! Can ten years of good
behavior expiate ten thousand years of
bad? What use is peace in the south,
while there are still rebels in the
north? Come to us again, when no Human
has killed either an Ape or another
Huran for one hundred years -

MACDONALD
And we have all been exterminated -

ALDO
(with relish)

Hal
MACDONALD

- because we are no longer of use to
you -
CAESAR
(gently, but with
authority)
Macdonald, the fact that you saved ny
life twice on the Night of the Fires does
not entitle you to address this Council
or to formulate policy. You, too, are
& servant. What sets you above your
fellows is that you are mine,
(smiling)
And I hope you will remain so.
BOOM! The audience may jump at the sound of 0,S. cannon-fire,
but not those inside the Council Chamber, who have been expecting
it, Macdonald, deferential again, looks at his watch.

MACDONALD
Your subjects await you, Caesar.

As all rise, we CUT TO:

BOOM! In the courtyard outside, & cannon (operated by Gorillas)
fires a second "royal" salute to cheers and cries of:

MASSED APES
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar! ad lib.

cur TO:

The “robing room"

where Caesar is being groomed and invested in
@ resplendently green ceremonial cloak by his VALET, while the
sound of the firing and crowd-voices continues outside. We

PAN OFF him to:

LISA (the female Chimpanzee from "CONQUEST") being similarly
roved and groomed by two human MAIDS in blue servant-costumes.

As a Maid tightens Lisa's beit, Lisa (to both Maids! consternation)
8.
gives an involuntarily little gasp of pain but follows it
instantly with a smile of reassurance, pats her own belly and

whispers something in the Maid's ear.

MAID
Oh, Matam I'm so glad.
CAESAR
Come, Lisa, The citizens are

waiting.
They go out and emerge into:

The courtvard - followed at a discreet distance by Macdonald,
Here a EODYGUARD of six Gorillas salute and escort them through

the parted Ape Crowd into:

Modern City's Civie Center. Pretty much the same as it was in
"Conouest" except for the one stupefying change: the Master-
Servant situation has been completely reversed. Everywhere
the Apes are now the masters and mistresses ~ Gorillas in
black, Chimps in Green, Orangutans in orange-brown = and the

Humans (males in red, ferales in blue) are now the slaves.

At Caesar's passing, the Male Apes bow and the Females (sore
with difficulty) bob curtseys. The Humans obseouiously give
place to him and his entourage (or are non-violently chivvied
into doing so by the Gorillas) as the tour of inspection
proceeds and reveals how weirdly the tables have been turned

since the end of "Conquest",
Everywhere are yellow flags and posters of Caesar's
head backed by the symbolically blood-red flames of
the Night of the Fires. A triumphal banner across
the royal route proclaims: "HAIL, CAESARI”

In a greengrocer's shop window, replete with fruit and
vegetables, a human ARTIST is bedecking effigies of

Caesar and Lisa with fresh flowers,

A P.A, speaker bawls: "Citizens of Ape City! Caesar
is amongst you and commands that you show him neither
ceremony nor homage on this festal day that celebrates
thirteen years of Ape Freedom,"

cuT TO;
Chimpanzee ANNOUNCER, continuing in studio: "Let there

be no formalities. But go your ways in peace."

Gorilla POLICEMAN surreptitiously chivvying one of
half-a-dozen human SWEEPERS who have been cleaning
up the entry into:

The Piazza, where we INTERCUT Caesar and Lisa with
P,0.V. shots:

At the outdoor cafe, seated Apes are being served by
Humans with bananas, oranges, grapes and raisins which
they eat with attempted refinement. A Chimp calls
“Waiter!", A Gorilla (less articulate) thumps the

table, and a human WAITER comes obsequiously running.
10,
- In a playground a group of Ape CHILDREN are sliding down
chutes, sitting on see-saws and swinging on swings under
the supervision of a female Human Teacher, (LINDY). At
Caesar's approach:
LINDY
Now what shall we play, children?
Follow My Leader or Blind Ape's Buff?
CHILDREN

(in dutiful unanimity)
Follow My Leader!

Caesar is delighted. His Group descends into:

- A pedestrian subway, where we pass doors to three
restrooms respectively labeled "Ladies", "Gentlemen"
«+ + » and "Humans", It is from the last of these that
there emerges a human STRANGER, who blocks the Group's
progress: a tall, lean John Carradine type with
fanatical blue eyes and an authority enhanced by his
clothes which are of the trim but travel-stained sort
that Hurans used once to wear.

STRANGER

{ironic smile)
Hail, Caesar,

Macdonald hastily interposes himself between the Stranger and

an angry Caesar flanked by his angrier Bodyguard,

MACDONALD
(quietly)
By what right are you not in servant's
uniform?
11.

STRANGER
By the right of humans to dress as
they please.

CAESAR
(quietiy)
Humans have no rights except those
conferred on them by Apes.
(to Guard-Commander)
Arrest him.

As the Guard moves forward:

STRANGER
Wait!

The monosyllable has the stopping force of a .45 bullet.

STRANGER
If you harm one hair of my head,
this City will be destroyed.

In the silence, Lisa touches her belly, whimpers and hides her
eyes. But Caesar suddenly relaxes and rolls his eyes skyward

in mock resignation.

CAESAR
Another lunatic!
(to the Guard Commander)
Detach two Gorillas to escort him to
General Aldo's Headquarters for
interrogation. Then report to me.

Guard Commander clicks to obedient attention,

MACDONALD
And Caesar?

CAESAR
Yes, Macdonald,

MACDONALD
May I respectfully suggest that he be
well-treated until we're sure?

CAESAR
Of what, Macdonald?

MACDONALD
Of his lunacy.
12.
Caesar frowns and turns to Guard Commander.
CAESAR
See to it.
(to Macdonald)
Come. We're wasting time.
The Escort moves off in one direction; the Group exits subway

in the other. Emerging, they pass:

A Barber's Shop, to which we CLOSE as Group exits shot. Human
hands remove a hot towel from the face of . .. an Ape. He is

having his shoes shined by a little BLACK BOY, to whom he tosses:

INSERT: A silver dollar-sized coin on the Boy's black palm,
It has Caesar's profiled image and is circumscribed "CAESAR 1
REX IMPFRATOR SIMIORUM*," From the image of Caesar's head:

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE To:

The real Caesar's profile, frowning in the doorway (opened by
Macdonald) of Aldo's office, as we slow PULL BACK during
dialogue to include Stranger (back turned, between Guards)
addressing Aldo, In the corner sits a human CLERK, punching a
shorthand-typewriter.
STRANGER
For the last time, I will speak
before no one but Caesar,
CAESAR
Caesar is here,

He sits, as Stranger whips round into confrontation,

CAESAR
What is your name?
Silence,

Silence,

13.

STRANGER

You took it away and gave me a number.
ALDO

What number?
STRANGER

(scornfully)

Do you expect me to remember it?
ALDO

Where have you come from?
STRANGER

The North.
ALDO

What territory?

MACDONALD
For your own sake, please tell us.

MACDONALD
Who are you?

STRANGER
A messenger.

CAESAR
Sent by. . .?

STRANGER
My master.

CAESAR

(patiently)

Has he a name?

STRANGER

We call him Nimrod...

Dialogue unexpectedly continues uninterrupted over a visual:

SHOCK CUT TO:
4,
NIMROD, seated et a portable wooden table in a tattered tent
through which the north wind flaps and whines. A grizzied
giant by John Wayne out cf Royal Dano, he wears the battered
cap of a former U.S. Army General and listens (with two young
"AIDES") to a radio-speaker on the tabletop.
STRANGER'S VOICE
(continuing, through speaker)
* » « because he was, and is, a mighty
hunter.
CAESAR'S VOICE
And what is his message?
Through the tent flap we focus briefly on a distand, oldetype

bomber plane being serviced by humans, and:
CUT BACK TO:
Aldo's Headquarters.

STRANGER
"Set our people free,"

An amused silence.

: CAESAR
No,

STRANGER
Or else -

CAESAR

(stung to anger)
Did you set us free, when we were
your slaves? There can be no "or else",

STRANGER
(quietly}
Caesar, there can, We have a plane
and we have a bomb,
15.
MACDONALD
{softiy)
Christ,
STRANGER
A bomb that could reduce this city -

which is the Capital of your Empire -
to rubble.

cuT TO:

The North. PULLING BACK from the exterior shot of bomb ready
for loading onto a plane ready for fuelling. NIMROD and AIDES
listening intently to the radio-speaker's crackling silence.
AIDE 1
That shook ‘em.

AIDE 2
Now they'll turn the heat on.

CAESAR'S VOICE
(through speaker)
Where is this Nimrod?

CUT TO:

_Aldots Headquarters,

STRANGER
I have told you. In the North.
ALDO
Where in the North?
Silence.
ALDO
(banging fist on table)
Where? Where? Where?
Silence.
ALDO
We can make you talk.
STRANGER

I repeat: if you harm one hair of
my head, your City will be destroyed.
16,
CAESAR

Apes have ways of hutring without
harming. Brutus!

One of the Gorilla Guards clicks to attention.

CAESAR
Show him,
BRUTUS (from behind) thrusts his hands under the Stranger's arms,
locks fingers across the Stranger's chest, and with sundry expert
movements of the thumbs, begins to apply a pressure which
(though it never wipes the scornful smile off the Stranger's
face) drenches him with the sweat of appalling pain. We INTERCUT
the faces of the onlookers - starting on the Clerk and ending
on Macdonald, who winces at the sudden, sickening crunch of
what seem to be breaking bones. Caesar and Aldo leap simultaneously
to their feet.
CAESAR
You fat-knuckled idiot! You've
broken his ribs.
But Brutus is feeling the Stranger's chest under his shirt, and
shaking his head,

BRUTUS

No. . eno.
ALDO

Then what have you broken?
BRUTUS

This.
17.
And from under the shirt he extracts a small, smashed, plastic

microphone attached to a miniature transmitter concealed in

the shirt's inner pocket.

ALDO
(indicating Stranger
to Guard 2
Shoot him,
MACDONALD
Caesar - |
CAESAR

The damage is done. We have been
heard. Our City is infected, Cleanse
itl
As Guerd 2's gun fires and blood spreads across the shirt of the

still-smiling Stranger:
CUT TO:

The North, Nimrod and "Aides" (the two latter are the pilots
who will undertake the mission) calculate that the time required
for fuelling the plane, installing the bomb and reaching the
target will be X hours, We the audience, therefore know that

there is.a dangerously short time-limit for the completion of:

Caesar's countermeasures. These are not unsubtle, Modern

City is of course equipped with deep shelters which, when

first constructed, were designed to accommodate the Human
population only. In the event of a nuclear attack, Apes would
have been left to fend for themselves, The situation must

now be reversed, though the reversal is tempered with a modicum

of mercy. Caesar breaks into the holiday celebrations with a
18.
dramatic Proclamation of Emergency on P,A, and TV. The threat
(he says) may be a hoax but the Council are taking no risks,

Deep shelters shall, for the moment, immediately be occupied

by Apes only.

Thereafter (says Caesar) whatever shelter space remains
available shall be allocated to Humans selected on a priority
basis for their potential usefulness to Ape Society. Humans
are asked to stand by public TV screens till those selected
have been surmoned (by their personal numbers) to fill
vacancies in designated shelters. Those not selected must find

what shelter they can in subways and cellars.

Throughout Caesar's announcement we INTERCUT its panic-effect
on the holiday-making populace - in the restaurant, where
half-eaten meals are left unfinished; in the playground, where
the Ape Children don't want to be parted from their Human
Teacher, Lindy; and in the Barber's Shop etc., etc.

At length the Apes are gone - leaving the Civic Center scattered
with holiday-litter and bewildered Humans. An elderly MALE,
as though in a trance, begins automatically to sweep the litter

from the sidewalks, Like a Zombie.

Caesar exits a conference with his Councilors (all are united
in adversity) and invites Macdonald to share the sanctuary
of his V,I.P, shelter, To Caesar's distress, Macdonald at
first refuses, He prefers to stay (and if need be die) with

his own people, Caesar gently argues, ending:
19.

CAESAR
Macdonald, it is wrong for a ruler
to be in his servant's debt. You
saved my life twice. I command you
to allow me to save yours.
MACDONALD
And if I refuse?
Caesar smiles and puts an arm on Macdonald's shoulder.

CAESAR
I'll have you shot.

Macdonald smiles, too .. . and gives in. They have reached:

The "Robing Room", where Lisa (alone) pleads to be allowed to
take her two huran maids, MARY and ANNA, into the shelter.
Reluctantly, Caesar feels compelled to restrict her to one.
Humans selected for shelter will chiefly be those who can

serve not individuals but the State, Poor Lisa! She will have
to make a difficult choice,

In the North, the bomb is about to be installed in the plane
and we learn something that Nimrod and the two Pilots have
known all along; that this is possibly a suicide mission with
a conceivable point of no return, Nimrod has gambled all but
& small reserve-percentage of his precious fuel on a death-blow
to Caesar's capital city. The Pilots have enough fuel to

reach the target area, drop the bomb and (with luck and good
weather) fly clear of the holocaust before effecting a forced

landing on their way home to the North,
20,

NOTE; In the above scene we visvally (and unassertively)
establish that Nimrod's campsite includes a car
graveyard containing veteran vehicles of the 1970's
and 1980's, A handful of humans are working (without
special urgency) to restore or service these,

CUT TO:

Exterior shots of Apes descending into various shelters - many

clutching suitcases and bags of food, some with (Ape) children.

One heavily-guarded shelter is also the City Arsenal, filled

with boxes of ammunition and crates of small arms. We end on

V.I.P, shelter with Caesar, Lisa, Pan, Aldo, Zeno, other

Councilors and Aides, Macdonald and the valet, George. Outside,

the two human maids, Anna and Mary, approach the shelter with

confidence. Lisa cannot bear to watch the heart-rending scene

as Anna is given access and Mary is excluded.
In the North, the bomb is installed in the plane.

In the Civic Center the lower-calibre hurans. (such as sweepers,
cleaners, laborers} cluster round an outdoor TV screen, waiting,
praying that their names may be called. Indoors, the higher-
calibre technicians, teachers, medics etc. watch their own TY
sets in srall, sparsely furnished roots and shared apartments,
The sets are switched on, but the screens stay silent and black,

until:
A VOICE booms out over Civie Center:

"Attention all Humansi"

The screen brightens to reveal a (Chimpanzee).
21.

ANNOUNCER

(as we INTERCUT listeners)
The following will report immediately
to Shelter 9 at the intersection of
Caesar Avenue and Armando Street.*
They will wear their identity discs
and carry no baggage except such
portable tools and devices as are
vital to the useful prosecution of
their profession or their trade.
Their mates (whether male or female)
will not be admitted to the shelter;
and no human child shall be released
from the School Pound, where second-
class shelter is available in the
cellars,

Now, as the Announcer (seen on various screens) calls each name
and number - preceded by an initial letter denoting his or
her calibre - we CUT or PAN to the name's owner. Thus, on a

small indoor screen:

ANNOUNCER
A34577 Clement, veterinary surgeon.

We PAN off TV screen to Clem, a handsome young vet in his
surgery. With a sigh of relief, he begins methodically to put

instruments and drugs into his medical bag.

CUT TO:

Civic Center's big screen,

ANNOUNCER
C21632 Bradford, carpenter,

CUT TO:

 

* For Ape-buffs. Armando, Caesar's human foster-father, was
killed for trying to help Caesar in “CONQUEST",
22,
Brad, in his burly mid-30's, looking at screen. He already
carries his small tools in his belt and his larger ones ina
bag. He moves off, to the undisauised envy of the Crowd,

There could be trouble brewing.

We continue to CROSS-CUT this “call-up" of the Hurans in Modern
City with the progress of the plane's preparation in the North;
and it may be assumed that, whenever we CUT to the North, further
names are being called in the South - names, whose owners we
shall only meet for the first time in the picture's second

half, Meanwhile, after the calling up of (say) an architect

and an engineer, we:

cuT TO:

Large indoor wall screen.

ANNOUNCER
B135984 Melinda, schoolteacher.
We PULL PACK to Lindy alone and frightened in her schoolroom,
seated at a high desk in front of blackboard scribbled with
simple surs and the quotation "We must love one another or
die."* She begins to collect colored crayons, pens, pencils,

drawing pads, exercise books etc.

cur TO:

Small screen in shared apartment.

ANNOUNCER
Al49760 Alexander, animal psychiatrist.

OOo ne

* WOH, Auden
23.

We PULL BACK to two men in a room whose shelves jointly
accommodate the books of the psychiatrist (LEX) and the
technical parphernalia of the radio-ham (FRANK). Lex is
thin, bespectacled and frail. Frank - dark, saturnine and
compact, emanates the same dynamic power as the man we called
"The Stranger".

LEX

(sincerely)
I'm sorry, Frank.

But Frank is brooding and doesn't answer. Lex surveys his books,

LEX
I guess my . . . baggage is all
in my head. I'll just take soap
and a toothbrush,
(fingering his weak chin)
And maybe grow a beard at last.

His fingers have touched the cord of his identity-dise, which

he pulls out from under his shirt. And Frank stares at it.

LEX
Mustn't lose this.

FRANK
You might as well,

LEX
Might as well what?

FRANK
Lose it, Lex.

LEX

(alarmed)

Frank, what dtyou want?

FRANK

I want to survive, Lex.
a4,
He snatches at the disc and pulls it so that the cord bites
into the back of Lex's neck.
LEX
(resisting)
Frank, you can't get away with it,
You're not a psychiatrist. You're a
radio technician - |
Frank begins to twist the disc so that the cord twists, too.

Just before Lex is (inevitably) strangled, we:
cuT TO:

Shots of low-calibre unselected Humans drifting, dazed and
terrified, about the darkening streets. They begin to coalesce

into a Mob.

Selected Humans queuing to go down into Shelter 9. Their
identity-discs are checked against a typed list at the head
of the descending stone stairway, Lindy approaches checkpoint,
followed by Frank,

B135984 Me lindas schoolteacher.

GORILLA GUARD
Pass.

FRANK
A149760 Alexander, animal psychiatrist.

After a sufficient pause to provide tension:

GORILLA GUARD
Pass.

A step below Frank, Lindy slightly stumbles. He grabs her

elbow to prevent a fall.
25.

LINDY
Thank you, Mr. . . Alexander.

FRANK

(grinning)
Call me Lex,

More Humans at the end of the queue go down, down, down, down. .

And in the North, the two Pilot-Aides go up, up, up into the

plane,

Dusk. The unselected Mob marches on a Bank. There'll be
vaults, there, and maybe money for later - if there is a
"later". They are smashing the windows with broom handles,

when the last Ape Police Squad to patrol the City opens fire.

A pitched battle ensues between a Squad with firearms and a

Mob (superior in numbers) armed only with brooms, picks, spades,
hammers etc. Inevitably many Humans are massacred; but some
climb through the broken glass and vanish into the Bank, A
siren wails, summoning all Ape personnel back into the shelters,

The Police Squad recedes. Silence broken by:

Exterior, The plane's four great jet engines suddenly roar
into earsplitting life. We PULL BACK to include Nimrod and his

"Army" assembled to bid the revving-up plane farewell.

Shots of shelter doors sliding shut. Night is falling on
Modern City.

With a thunderous roar the plane takes off and heads south

into the deepening dusk.
26.
Interior of plane. Tense technical dialogue between the
two (doomed?) Pilots. The fuel and altimeter dials of the
veteran plane are established. Its condition is less than

perfect.

The red and yellow flags and poster-portraits of Caesar flutter
over darkening streets deserted and empty except outside the
Bank, where wounded Human Survivors of the massacre still

faintly moan and stir. From a poster-portrait we:
cuT TO:

Caesar, deep underground with his entourage, planning for an
enigmatic future. We end on:
ZENO
What more can we do?
CAESAR
We can wait,
Interior of plane, buffeted by headwinds. The fuel dial is
falling. To evade turbulence, Pilot 1 drops to the minimum
altitude consistent with clearing the bomb's explosion, and

peers from the cockpit into. . .black night.

Impressive GROUND-SHOT of Modern City by night. Streetlamps

have lit automatically and some windows are lit, though empty.
From his shelter, Caesar orders a General Blackout,

INSERT: A hairy Orangutan hand throws a switch {or switches)

in subterranean power house.
27.
FULL SHOT: City. All the lights go out. And very, very
gradually in the long, momentous silence, we hear the drone of
the approaching plane. As it loudens, one of the engines

begins to stutter.

The drone and the stutter can just (but only just) be heard by
an elderly female human SUPERVISOR in the cellars of the School
Pound, where she sits surrounded by scared human CHILDREN,

She takes a pectoral cross from its concealment in her bosom and

holds it towards the children.

SUPERVISOR
Children, this is called the cross of
Christ, who is still said secretly by
many of us to be the Son of God. Let
us pray for our safety to Him and to
His Father. Repeat after me:
Our Father...

CHILDREN
Our Father...

SUPERVISOR
Which art in heaven...

CUT TO:
Interior of plane,

PILOT 1
We're losing height, It's now or
never.

PILOT 2
Now.

We CLOSE to his hand activating the vbomb's release, And PILOT 1

puts plane into a screaming steep turn, as we:

The City. No sound of the detonation. But night slowly
brightens into day, and the day slowly dazzles. We catch the
classic Hiroshima glimpse of a stray HUMAN backed against a
stone wall. ‘Then his body vanishes and only his silhouette
remains burnt into the wall... which splits, The screen
bleaches to a white, blinding incandescence; and the thunder

We've been very economical.

Shape 1 throws a switch on the wall above the table, and light

floods the abandoned Ape shelter.

SHAPE 2
That's better.

It isn't better - for us. Both Humans are hairless as albinos;

QUICK TIME-DISSCLYE TC:
Shots of small, bewildered huran bands - shocked, stricken and
in tatters, wandering aimlessly in a dazed effort to live off

the scorched earth, over which a brown fog hangs like @ pall.

One such band fights for possession of a withered bush which
bears neither leaves nor berries. Another group voraciously
falls on and dismembers the brittle skeleton of a man -
separately to suck and chew the dry, fleshless bones.*

MONTAGE with triumphal MUSIC: the trek to greener pastures,
where the air is clean, and the odd dove or rabbit makes
the practical Agnes long for a gun. Even this is to be
vouchsafed her, as we END MONTAGE on:

Group meeting up with the few ragged but cheerful survivors
of the "Mob" who took refuge in the Bank. Under the leadership
of an amiable giant called Jud, they (like the Children) are
heading north, The trek resumes and they come within sight
of a screen of distant trees. And suddenly a little BOY cuts
through the chatter;

Listen!

The chatter stops.

Listen to that bird.
Distantly from behind the trees, we hear: "Pink! Pink! Pink!"

FULL SHOT: The Gorilla Cavalry breaks cover through the screen
of trees, Riding bareback (as Caesar, a former circus rider,
must have taught them) they gallop in a wide semicircle which
closes in a pincer-movement to outflank and surround the
huddled Hurans, who are netted and rounded up like cattle into
ene (or two) horse-drawn cages that have followed the attacking

squadron,

But one Danny escapes; and as the carts rumble out of shot, we
stay with him crouching, crawling and snaking, finally, to the
shelter of a cave-mouth, into whose half darkness we follow him,
Alrost instantly he hears steps and voices approaching from
deeper in the cave. He flattens hirself into concealrent
behind a rocky buttress.

He turns back to wave good-bye to the owner of Voice 2 (now
dimly discernible in the shadows) and sees Danny flattened
against the buttress.

The owner of Voice 2 walks into the light. He is the third

CUT TO:
Escorted by Gorilla cavalry, the two carts break through the

leafy screen into:

The new Ape City under process of construction. The effect
should be inspiring, for Apes and their selected Human Experts
are working together energetically and harmoniously ~ though
the Hurrans address even the humblest Ape-leborer as "Sir".

From the P,O.V. of the Hurans in the certs, CAMERA ROVES:

- Ape-wielded picks striking on stones as cave-like
dwellings are scooped out of rock under the supervisior
ef a Human ARCHITECT who, from time to time, unrolls
paper-plans and deferentially issues further suggestions

to the workers.

- The Arena (seen in APES 2) now almost finished, as
Apes raise and anchor a tall flagpole at its center

beside which others are erecting a dais,

- Impressionistic glimpses of Apes being taught under
Human supervision to cultivate the land - e.g. seed
sowing, vine growing, digging or even ploughing.

(The choice of images will be guided by our budget
but must convey that, in terms of food, the community

is becoming self-sufficient.)
37.
~ Settled in a country where wildlife has not been

exterminated, the inhabitants have access to furs,
fibres, feathers, hides, skins, barks, and simple
fabrics which Female Apes can be seen plucking,
plaiting, cutting and crudely tailoring in the open
Squares. As we pass, we see fruits and vegetables
stacked in a free (but rationed) Market, where 2
Gorilla Supervisor disposes to each Ape his due.

An aduit Orangutan trying to steal an extra orange is

summarily whipped.

~- From a shot of the carts entering the double-~geteway
of a Huran Compound, we:

cut TO:

‘acdonald opening double-doorway to usher Caesar to the head

of the Inner Council table where Aldo, Zeno and Pan await him.

NOTE:

What we shall call the "Palace" complex (Council Room,
Living Room and Bedchamber) demands credibility of
construction and decor. Let us assume that our Human
Carpenter (Brad) has supervised the making of chairs,
tables and beds. Some of the fabrics have been
transported from Modern City; others we have just

seen being woven. Intermittent sound effects will

indicate that construction is not yet complete.

Meanwhile, the Inner Council's debate opens. In gist:
38.

CAESAR

Why did they fire at us?
MACDONALD

They didn't, They fired at a rabbit.
ALDO

(darkly)

How can you be sure?
MACDONALD

We have the rabbit.
ALBO

Then I suggest that they share its
fate. Rabbits breed. So will they.

PAN
Caesar has Said again and again
that the time for killing is over.
Let them live and serve the Community
like their fellows.

ALDO
(scornfully }
Pan, the pacifist!

CAESAR
General Aldo, your army exists to
keep the peace - not to break it,

ALDO
And what if they break us?

The sound of sawing starts in an adjacent room, and Caesar's
hand goes suddenly to his head.
ZENO
(noticing)
I have a compromise. Let their
survival depend on their co-operation,
CAESAR
(head in pain)
In favor... ?
Sawing continues as Zeno raises his hand, followed (after a

pause) by Pan.
39.

ALDO
Does that include the children and
their supervisor?

PAN
I move that they be put in charge
of the teacher, Lindy.

ALDO
(outraged)
You intend to educate them? In
the same schools as our own young?

ZENO
(soothingly)
Again, provided they co-operate.

ALDO
What child ever did?

Now hammering starts in the next room.

CAESAR
Macdonald, can that noise be stopped?
What are they building?

MACDONALD
A cot for what we hope will be Caesar's
son.
PAN
(gently)
They haven't much time.
ALDO
My son was born upon the ground.
CAESAR
(with sudden, icy

fury)
Your son was not royal. And the
propriety of a prince's cot is not
@ matter for debate in council.

ALDO
As Caesar pleases.

Harmer, hammer, hammer!
ho,
CAESAR
(both hands to head)
Where's Lex?

MACDONALD
I'll find hin,

"Lex" returning through Ape City. He meets Macdonald and, just

before moving out of shot, they pass:

FOURI

Not an Ape~child has spoken. Agnes smiles smugly at Lincy.

INT. Medical hut in palace grounds. "Lex", Macdonald and Cler,
the vet, (whom we shall call Doc) briefly and privately discuss

Caesar's condition. Doc suspects a disease endemic among chimps:
41,
brain-expansion in an unexpandable cranium. But no X-ray apparatus
is available to confirm this. Has "Lex" had any success
psychiatrically? Not much, Some kind of mental censorship is
preventing Caesar from talking freely. Doc offers to inject a
minimal dose of pentothal to "unbutton” him. As they leave for the
palace:

CUT TO:
UNDERGROUND. Mutant 3 guiding Danny, the gunsmith, along a subway
to the steady thrum of a generator which may well be the source of
dim lighting. They are pausing by a mutant-ranned radio transmitter
whose retractable aerial soars through an air vent.
OPERATOR
Come in, Nimrod. Come in, Nimrod.
A voice, very distorted by static, answers ~ unintelligibly to us
but not to the operator,

Frank, alias Alexander, alias Lex,
reports that he is well established
under agreed cover in Caesar's
court-circle and...
Mutant 3 and Danny have moved on, as Operator's Voice dwindles and

Out of the bits and pieces the Apes

left us, I want to construct a
rather unusual missile.

{guarded)
Will it harm my own kind?
MUTANT 3
Not noticeably.
INT. Anteroom to bedchamber, CLOSEUP: Doc's hypodermic needle
retracts from a small, red-tagged plastic container and is expelled
into Caesar's arm. As we PULL BACK to include a couch and stool:
Doc
Caesar, youtll feel drowsy at
first. Then relaxed. Relaxed

enough to talk to...
(indicating)
Lex.

An interruption. Lisa's human maid, Anna, enters to say that her
mistress's labor-pains have started. Caesar only drowsily reacts.
Doe quietly puts back the pentothal-container in his dector's bag,
from which he now extracts (say) a sphigmometer and a tube of tablets
Ke leaves with Anna. And "Lex", seated behind Caesar's drowsy
head, is left looking intently into the bag - in which is a second
Plastic container identical with the first, except that it is
dDiack-tagged.

CUT TO:
Only two more quick scenes before the Action starts:
1, INT, Bedchamber, Doc, his ministration over, looks down at

Lisa* with a reassurance he does not feel.

 

* Though in this outline Lisa's role may appear skeletonic, we
hope to build her relationship with Caesar into something
tender, humorous and touching.
43,
boc

'Itil be around, ma'am. Send

Anna if you need me.'
He takes Anna aside into the passage connecting bedchamber with
anteroom and tells her that, due probably to the long, arduous trek
from Modern City to Ape City, the baby's position is wrong. It's
not going to be an easy birth. Suddenly we hear Caesar's tormented
voice loudening vehind the anteroom door.

cuT TO:

2. INT. A dramatic set-piece for Caesar, at long last giving vent
to his guilt at having been instrumental in the death of his beloved
huran foster-father, Arrando. (His lamentation will also serve to se-
this picture in the context of its predecessors.) "He loved me,

and I killed him. There will be no more killing, while I am King.”

"Lex" glibly soothes him. Armando died so as not to betray Caesar.
Had he so betrayed him, the Apes would still be slaves. If
Armandots spirit survives, he would be happy at his own suicide's
eutcome, We end on Caesar's childlike whimper of dependency that
characterised his parting from Armando in "CONQUEST":
CAESAR

Armando . . . Armando... Armando...
A Boow! from the ceremonial cannons - which we may presume to have
been horse-drawn and/or manhandled months ago into Ape City.
Caesar's personal standard breaks from the flagpole as the royal

cortege approaches the dais in full view of the crowded Amphitheatre.
A,
Lisa walks shakily on Caesar's arm, followed by Anna carrying the
blanketed baby. Deferentially in the rear come Doc (with his bag)
and "Lex" - respectively in attendance on Caesar and Lisa. As they
mount the dais, Lisa stumbles slightly ~ and Doc exchanges 2
disapproving headshake with "Lex", The Queen should not have deer,

allowed out so soon.

A hush falls, as Caesar takes the baby from Anna's arms. Then,
with Lisa by his side, ne holds the child aloft.
CAESAR
To the Council, to the Senate

and to the People of this City,
I present my newborn son...

Tremendous cheering.

CAESAR
And I name him, after my Ape
father and my human foster-father,
Cornelius Armando,
The cannens boom; and as the cheering peaks, Lisa sways and falls.
"Tex" is at Caesar's side, Caesar gives him the baby to hold and
crouches in great concern over Lisa, whom Doc ts already attending.
LISA
{frightened eyes
flickering)
Pain... pain...
Too many Apes, eager to help, are crowding the dais. Anna cannowv

reach her mistress, The Gorilla Police move in to hold them back.
45,
Doc opens his bag, fills his hypodermic from the black-tagged

Plestic container and injects its contents into Lisa's arm, Five

minutes later she is dead.

Doc, stunned and bewildered, can only stare and stare - first at
Lisa, then at his hypodermic. Caesar, reverting momentarily to
primitivity, utters a single howl of grief and, with hands pressed
to his aching head, begins to "keen" in a low, moaning note as he
recks from side to side inconsolably. The CROWD begins to surge
towards the dais, but are held back by Aldo's Gorilla Police.

Zeno is given access to the dais; by Macdonald, trying to fight

through to Caesar's side, is clubbed to unconsciousness dy a
rifle-butt,

ZENO
(calling from dais)
The Queen is dead,

ALDO
(among his troops,
from below)
The Queen is murdered!

CAESAR

(regaining his senses)
Lex! Look to the child...

He rises and peers about the dias. Then, in panic:

CAESAR

Le-e-e-x!
Over a sudden, appalled and total hush, we:

cut TO:
46,
"Lex" moving quickly but carefully through a high thicket above
the Amphitheatre . . . with the blanketed baby in his arms. He

pauses for a second to lock down on:

Aldo ordering out, first, the cavalry to sweep the countryside in
& search for "Lex"; then the police to arrest Doc, “the assassin";
and finally the infantry to herd all the Humans like cattle into
their compound and set up guards round both it and the Human

children's school.
47,
QUICK SHOTS, CROSS-CUTTING

- Cavalry thunderously chasing "Lex", who escapes unseen

after appallingly narrow shaves.

by chimp stretcher-bearers.

- Doc's bag being dumped on a table for examination by
an Orangutan,
- "Lex", with blanketed-baby, slipping safely into the
Mutant's cave-mouth,
CUT TO;
At Gorilla Police Headquarters, Doc is savagely grilled by a
Gorilla and an Orangutan interrogator. Doc protests that the
drug containers must have been switched by "Lex" to create a
confusion in which the Queen's death would distract attention
from the kidnapping of the baby. Scene ends on:
Doc
Lex must have been an impostor.
CUT TO:
CLOSEUP: ZENO

ZENO
Or a conspirator.

PULL BACK TO:

Let us at least keep ours, What
motive had the Doctor for murder?
He'd already warned Caesar that
the Queen was unfit to attend the
child's public presentation, He
was among the most privileged of our
human advisers,

ALDO
Even privileged worms turn. Unless
you stamp them into the ground.

CAESAR
(wearily)
Lex was privileged, too. Might
they not both have conspired to kill
my wife and kidnap my Son?

PAN
Then why did he make no attempt to
escape with Lex? I believe the

Nimrod looks out through tent-flap at:

P.O.V. LONG SHOT: The car graveyard, which is no longer a
graveyard, Scores of mechanics have transformed abandoned hulks
into viable vehicles. The vechicles may be old crocks but

no means crippled, Over this, as revving cuts out:
NIMROD'S VOICE

CUT TO:
PANNING SHOT: V.I.P. Shelter under Modern City. It has been
cleaned up and sparsely furnished. A wall shelf contains a
few canned goods that could have been officially distributed from

cellared stocks below the bomb's reach. PAN ENDS on:

Previously-established MUTANTS 1 and 2 seated at the wooden

Baby Chimp from a bottle, and crooning a traditional lullaby whose
words (curiously) seem more apposite to simian than human babies.

CUT TO:
Council Meeting continuing, Caesar, under increasing mental and
physical stress, shows signs of cracking. Muffled hammering

sounds intermittently outside, during:

CAESAR
My wife is murdered and my son
stolen. The Humans are in conspiracy
against us,

PAN
There is no evidence that all
Humans -

CAESAR

(yelling like Hitler)
The point about conspiracy is that
there should be no evidence,
(quieter)
Which of them can now be trusted?

A silence, broken by:

ALDO
The answer to mistrust is massacre.
If they live, they talk. If they talk,
they plot, If they plot, we die.

PAN
(leaping to his feet)
Caesar has sworn publicly that "the
time for killing is over!" That is
an oath which cannot be broken.

CAESAR
(with a slyness that
should shock us)
It can be modified.

PAN
How?

CAESAR
By cutting out their tongues,

A longer silence, broken by:

ZENO
There must be more merciful ways
of making @ man dumb.

CAESAR
{abruptly rising)
Then find them.

And he stalks darkly out of the Council Chamber through the

ante-room door, leaving:

After a pause:

PAN
(appalled)
It's madness.
ALDO

It makes sense, If they cannot
speak, they cannot conspire. If
they cannot conspire, they cannot

Caesar entering Bedchamber, where Lisa lies robed "in state",
As he kneels by the bedside, telling her that her death shall
be revenged, the hammering starts up again. Caesar strides

angrily to the window and confronts:

P.O.V, CLOSE SHOT: Brad, the carpenter, flanked by two Gorilla
Guards, He deferentially explains that he is completing a coffin
for the Queents Funeral tomorrow, and now carefully, delicately
screws in a single ornamental metal knob on the coffints lid,
So carefully, so delicately, that we shall remember the scene
in retrospect,
BRAD
It's finished,

Medical Hut starting on CLOSE TOP SHOT of a neatiy dissected
rabbit, pinned down and variously labeled on a wooden board,
We PAN down to a dead dove, doubtless awaiting similar treatment
beside it, and -PULL BACK to include Zeno and ZAIA in a bare room
hung with anatomical charts of Apes and Humans. One chart

compares their vocal systems.

Zaia is & young and personable ferale Orangutan - possibly an

ancestress of Dr. Zaius in Apes 1 and 2,

ZENO
Zaia, I speak in confidence, For
our survival's sake, this thing may
soon have to be done, All I'm now
asking you, as the Doctor's best
pupil in anatomy, is how it could
effectively be done with the least
pain.
53.

Zaie picks up a pointer and moves confidently to the wall-charts,

ZAIA
The Doctor says that every human
being above the level of an idiot
develops a speech-center on one side
of the brain depending on whether he
is left or right handed. There are
modern procedures which so pinpoint
the speech-center, and the audio and
visual areas tied in With it, that
ali the faculties concerned could be
obliterated = as painlessly as they
would be by an electrically induced
stroke,

ZENO
Could Man, so treated, still serve
the community in however lowly a
capacity?

ZAIA
Only as fodder for the birds and
beasts and the fishes that he's almost
succeeded in exterminating.

ZENO
We don't want that - yet,

ZAIA
{indicating on chart)
Then with relatively little pain, you
could sever the laryngeal nerve
lilaterally in the neck - and paralyze
his vocal chords without paralyzing
his other faculties.

We CUT IN CLOSE SHOT of the caged Macdonald, suddenly very alert.

He shoots a meaningful glance at Doc.

The cloud was moving.

Now Aldo turns as alert as:

Caesar, I said there seemed no further
point in talking. I meant that
literally.

I offer myself to be made mute.

Doc

The daylight's fading. Tomorrow,
Caesar, at high noon,

You have saved your people certainly
from pain and possibly from massacre.

Why did you call back the main body?

proficient menace as she straps Macdonald to the wooden
operating-table and begins deftly to shave the stubble
on both sides of his neck with a cut-throat razor.

Outside the open window, a Gorilla Guard looks in.

SYNOPSIS OF FINAL PHASE

Scarcely has Alco spoken, than a shell explodes short of the Human
compound and an ancient recce-plane radios back the information to
Nimrod's artillery, Aldo and his retinue race to organize the

Ape counter-attack, Even as they leave, two more shelis destroy
the Human Compound - but not before the Children have escaped in
the confusion through the perimeter fence of wooden stakes planted

too closely for adult Humans to wriggle through.

Nimrod has destroyed the Humans intentionally. They are “collaborazsr

with the Apes and constitute a Fifth column that must be exterrinat.

 

The main Ape-Huran battle is joined in the rocky open country betweer
the site of Modern City and Ape City. Basically it is a battle
between Humans driving veteran vehicles with the reckless abandon of
stock cars, and Apes on foot or horseback. But the Apes' armory
(cannon and small-arms brought from the Modern City Arsenal) is
bigger and more up-to-date than Nimrod's. They have also been

taught (when building Ape City) to lay and detonate explosive
charges, which they use to deadly effect in rear of Nimrod's out-
flanked Army. The battle rages with the do-or-die intensity of
Custer's Last Stand, Nets, too, are brought into use, and the

srerled-up vehicles are pounded by gunfire into immobility.

#4 hanstul of Human survivors flee for refuge to the cave mouth,
wnese location they know. They are joined in flight by the
escapes children, and the group enters the cave mouth to descend

inte Mutantville below,

But Ape Scouts have observed this, and Aldo now advances his cavalry
in a final charge which isolates Nimrod and is driving him back

cwarss the cave mouth when:

rex. the cave mouth itself, Danny the Gunsmith and Mutant Technicians
fire vhe mysterious projectile which falls just short of the
acvancing Apes and momentarily halts them, It doesn't explode, but
Rv ticks; and while it ticks, Mutant 1's voice on a loud hailer

Taxes an announcement.

The projectile contains (says the voice) a sophisticated and once-

vep-secret nerve gas which (through the innocent appearance of its

 

nders) escaped detection by the Apes in the old Arsenal. The
fasts volatility is as considerable as its operational range, and

its specific effect is painlessly to induce sterility and therefore

 

, reproductivity in those who inhale it. It is if you like

te teil it so, a Genocide Zord. And it will explode in "X" seconds.
 

67.

zeno and Aldo need only briefly confer before deciding to retreat -
for the Ape Race must survive by breeding, if it is to fulfill its
mission of dominating Mankind. As the Apes gallop away, the ticking
stops and the projectile explodes - too soon (we suspect) to save

the Apes from sterility.

Mutant 1 now appears in the cave mouth to greet:
NIMROD
They call me Nimrod, but my name
is General Mendez* I've

come to offer my services to the
Human cause.

(pausing in the

cave mouth)
What's the name of the nerve gas
in that projectile?

MUTANT 1
It has no name.

NIMROD
Because it's so secret?

MUTANT 1
It has no secret either, It doesn't
exist. The projectile was empty.
Back in Ape City, Zeno reads a proclamation ordaining that from this
day Aldo and himself will be the City’s joint rulers. He also
ordains that the infected land between Modern City and Ape City
shall be called the "Forbidden Zone" (see Apes 1 and 2) and begins

to deliver the first of the anti-Human homilies later to be

* Mendez is the name of the dynasty that is one day to rule Mutantville.
