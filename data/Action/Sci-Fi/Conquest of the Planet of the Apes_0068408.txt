EXT, HIGHRISE HELIPORT - DAY 14

The copter puts down on the landing pad, and half-a-dozen
Commuter Types debouch, followed by ARMANDO (the circus
proprietor from "BS CAPE" ) leading CAESAR, a young but
full-grown chimpanzee on a leash, Caeaar, wearing a
eheacked shirt, black britches and riding boots, carries

a stack of publicity handouts in his hairy hand. The
passengers go through a checkpoint at which TWO UNIFORMED
STATE SECURITY OFFICERS examine their identity carda.
There is nothing perfunctory about this: each person's card
is scrutinized closely ty the unsmiling officers...
Armandc and Caesar are the last in line. Armando handa
his card to OFFICER 1, who lecks at it. OFFICER 2 stares
disapprovingly at Caesar.

OFFICER 2
Do you have authorization to dress
him like that?

ARMANDO.
Yes, sir.

Armando hands an official-looking document to Officer 2,
who scans it, glances indifferently at Caesar.

OFFICER 2
A circus ape, huh?
ARMANDO
(proudly)
And the only one ever to have been
trained as a bareback rider in the
entire history of the circus.

Officer 2 hands the document back to Armando.

OFFICER 2
Circuses are past history.

ARMANDO
(smiling)
' Not while I live and breathe.
Officer 1 returns Armando's identity card.

OFFICER 1
All right, Senor Armando. Go ahead,

Your arms should move up and down

Caesar nods, vaguely puzzled, mimics Armando's movementa,

ARMANDO
Much better.
(smiling)
After twenty years you've picked up
evolved habits from me. That could
be dangerous. Even fatal.

CARSAR
But, Armando, I don't understand --

Armando puts a cautionary arm on Caesar's shoulders, looks
carefully around, then gestures him into a passageway.

INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE C~15

As they move toward the mouth of the ampty passage, Armando
Speaks with quiet urgency.

ARMANDO
Listen to mé, Caesar. There can
be only one talking chimpanzee on
earth, the child of the two talking
apes, Cornelius and Zira, who came
to us years ago out of the future
and Were brutally murdered for fear
that, one very distant day, Apes
might dominate the human race.

CAESAR
But outside of you no one knows
I even exist.

ARMANDO
And we must keep it that way, for
the fear remains. The mere fact _
of your existence would be regarded
as a great threat to mankind. When
you realize how apes are treated....

He traile off, troubled.

CAESAR
What were you going to say?
ARMANDO
(pause, with

effort
The comradeship of the circus where
humans are kind to animals..,is
very different from what you are
about to see.

A pedestrian ENTERS the passageway, comes toward them.

Shh! Don't talk from now on.

He tugs irritably on Caesar's leash for the benefit of
the approaching pedestrian.

ARMANDO
Come! Come!

Caesar lurches clumsily forward as the pedestrian passes
them.

ESCALATOR BASE - DAY D -15

They step onto an ascending escalator, to which Caesar is
obviously unaccustomed, for he keeps his eyes glued to his
feet.

ARMANDO
(a whisper)
Prepare for a shock.

Caesar stumbles off the escalator, then reacts with total
astonishment at the sight of:

our 16-

SHOPPING CENTER A-17

Thronged not only with HUMANS (Anglos, Blacks, Orientals),
pursuing their ordinary pleasures, but with APES pursuing
their appointed tasks. The humans' clothes, though _
expensively cut, &re austere, monochromatic. The apes'
costumes are variegated (gorillas in red, chimpanzees in
green, orangutans in tan) -- long-sleeved, full-length
robes for the females; trousers and chokered-collars

for the males. This sex-distinction in dress applies
equally to the Apes' children -- some of whom are seen
walking hand itn hand with thelr parents, learning to
serve, Some Apes carry baskets of clothing, others brooms
to sweep the pavement, or a mistress's dress hung in
cellophane over one arm and fresh from the cleaners,
Humans carry nothing. There are no vehicles in the
streets. And, despite the apes' apparent docility, they
exude an air of disquiet; some move slugglishly, openly
sullen, Others dart frightened glances at the many

POLICE OFFICERS who patrol the streets armed with
truncheons and electric "prodders."

reaction.

A slow-moving GORILLA who leang indolently on his broom.
A POLICEMAN appears behind him, jams his electric "prod"
into the gorilila's back. The latter ROARS angrily, turns,
saes the policeman, grudgingly resumes sweeping along the
curb. After a moment, the policeman turns away. The
gorilla, noting this, clumally, but with evident defiance,
scatters the trash he has accumulated with his broom,

then trudges over 1%, an idiotically triumphant smile on

hig face.
CAESAR E-20

obviously no longer young, lowers her shopping baskets to
the ground, places a hairy hand on her aching side. She
sees & bench some yards away, wavers, then moves toward it.
Printed on the bench are the words: “NOT FOR APES!" The
SICK APE reaches the bench, stares uncomprehendingly at

the printing. Then, haif-sensing there is something wrong
in what she is about to do, she lowers herself onto the

hench in a sitting position. TWO POLICEMEN descend on her,
the younger one wielding his trunctheon,

A SICK FEMALE APE

YOUNG POLICEMAN
Off, off! No, no! Dont! you see
the sign?

OLDER POLICEMAN
{grimly amused)
Take it easy. They can't read,

YOUNGER POLICEMAN
(worried)
Not yet they can't.

The sick ape wobbles off, snatching up her shopping
baskets,

CAESAR AND ARMANDO G-20

Caesar, horrified, turns to Armando who has tightened the
grip on his leash.

CAESAR
{a hoarse whisper}
You said humans treated the apes
like pets.

ARMANDO

They did ~- in the beginning.
CAESAR

They have made slaves .of them.

ARMANDO
Shh -~ let me show you what happened,

He leads Caesar across the shopping center.

EXT, PET MEMORIAL ~ DAY #-20
At the edge of the shopping center, crowning two adjoining
pedestals, are the carved marble figures of a dog and cat,
identified py respective plaques as ROVER and TABBY. A
larger plague at the common base of the two pedestals

anter, Caesar gazes in stupefaction at the statues, then
turns inquiringly to Armande,

ARMANDO
They ali died within « few months,
nine years ago -~ every dog and cat

in the world. [ft was like a plague.
The disease that killed them was a
mysterious virus brought back from
outer space by one of the astronauts,
No existing vaccine or antidote was
of any heip,

CABSAR
Didn't the disease affect numans?

ARMANDO
No, they were immune, And ao, it
was discovered, were simians, even
the smallest ones. Thatts how it
began -- humans wanting Little
househeld pets to replace the ones
they had lost. First it was just
the marmosets and tarsier monkeys.
Phen, &@5 people realized how quick
they were ta learn, how easy to
train, the pets became larger and
larger. Until now...

He gestures to the crowd of apes and humana in the shopping
canter.

CAESAR
It's manstrous.

A POLICEMAN appears gome yards away behind them,
ARMANDO
Now you understand why I've kept
you away --
{seeing policeman}
Come, come!

He yanks at Caesar's leash, pulling him away as the
Policeman regards them idly.

NEW ANGLE ~ SHOPPING CENTER I-+20

Armando and Caesar approach an outdoor cafe where a group

& very slim pale green cigarette. In a flash a huge
gorilla waiter (FRANK), with a tray in one hand, proffers
his lighter with the other.

. LADY 1
Thank you, Frank,

She inhales and looks at the cigarette thoughtfully.

LADY 1
{to LADY 2)
Funny. Now that I know they won't
kill me, I don't enjoy them.

She stubs the cigarette out in an ashtray. At once FRANK
substitutes a new ashtray for the old. Intuitively or
intelligently? It's hard to say. Armando who sees Caesar
watching all this intently, signals for him to atart
distributing handbilis.

LADY 2
{looking up)
Well, for heaven sakes! A circus!

LADY 1
I saw one once in Europe.

As Caesar and Armando move among the tables on the side-
walk they encounter two uniformed APE HANDLERS with a huge
shackled gorilla (ALDO) in tow. The evolved and the
primitive Ape instinctively stop to survey each other,

HANDLER 1
(gently tugging
collar chain)
No, Aldo.

‘Qn the word "no," Aldo instantly cringes.

| ARMANDO
(gently tugging

Caesar's leash}

No.
After a moment's hesitation, Caesar "cringes" too, We
PAN them to the entrance of the bookshop. Ahead of them,
LISA, a female chimpanzee is entering the shop.

Caesar and Armando enter the shop as Lisa goes up to the
counter where a bespectacled LADY BOOKSELLER is seated.
Standing patiently to one side and behind her is a male

Orangutan shuffling to the case. He counts five shelves
down from the top, and (erroneously) two titles from the
left: "THE STORY OF SERVANTS' LIB" by Herbert Semhouse
and “PORN IS DEAD" by Minnie Sokolisky. He hesitates
between the latter and "A YOUNG QUEEN FAILS"; and picks
up “PORN IS DEAD" and takes to:

BOOKSELLER
(sharply)
No,

Orangutan halts dead in his tracks.

BOOKSELLER
NO!
Orangutan cringes helplessly, Bookseller strides irritably
to bookcase, takes down the right book, slaps it on the
counter. Lisa picks up the book, turns to go. A lock
passes between her and Caesar, Lisa likes what she gees.
As Lisa moves out of the shop:

Armando signals Caesar, who proffers a handout.

The waiters are crowding around the newly arrived gorilla,
ALDO, whose TWO HANDLERS are vainly trying to get him into
the building. Armando and Caesar enter SHOT during:

What's nis job?

HANDLER 1

Forget it. He's a messenger.

HANDLER 2

He pushes the Walter aside. Other waiters converge
aggressively on Handlers, and the shackled Aldo utters a
roar of panic, starts to break away from his escort, |
lethally flailing his chains. Two Policemen come to the
Handlers' rescue. All begin bludgeoning Aldo to the ground,

moves swiftly to where the Police and Handlers are beating
Aldo,

He watches with an approving expression as MacDonald
moves out of sight into the highrise. Handler 1 brutally
jabs the needle into Aldo, who gives a wild yell of pain,
resumes struggling. Once again Policeman 1 starts
bludgeoning him,

. CAESAR
(exploding) —
Lousy human bastards!

As Aldo slumps unconscious to the ground under the effect
of the injection, the Police and crowd, most of whose
backs have been turned, whip around to see: Armando
sweating; Caesar uncontrollably trembling. There is a
moment. of silence.

POLICEMAN 1
Who said that?

I did,

The two Policemen approach Caesar and scrutinize him.
The crowd is murmuring and pointing to Caesar. Armando,
sensing mounting danger, quickly thrusts a handout into
Policeman 1's hand.

There is a long, ominous pause..

Let me remind you of the reasons
why I can. Hoskyns, the cassette.

Hoskyns slips a cassette into a desk video-set, during:

recommendations made to the then-
President of the United States by
the Chairman of the Presidential
Commission. It's twenty years old
and a bit scratchy, but you'll
get the gist.

And perhaps stop leughing.

He activates the video-set. The Chairman appears on the
screen. We INTERCUT acreen with Armando, Breck, MacDonald,
Kolp, and Hoskyns.

CHAIRMAN
(on the video-tape)

We believe that the male and female
Talking Apes, Cornelius and Zira,
have come to us out of the future.
We believe their spoken testimony
that, Some two thousand years hence,
their descendants will have subjugated
and all but exterminated the human race
from the face of Earth. We believe
that under Ape supremacy Earth itself
will finally be destroyed, And we
knew that the Female Ape is now pregnant

child. If it is possible to alter
the future (and some of our scientists
believe it is}, it is our duty to do so.
The Commission therefore recommends
that the birth of the Female Ape'ts
unborn child should be prevented; and
that, after its prenatal removal, both
the male and the female should be
rendered incapable of begetting or
bearing another.

ZOOMING OUT FURTHER, we find its owner is an 39 Con
ORANGUTAN.

FOLLOW with:

SERIES OF SHOTS. ko

VERY QUICK, VERY BIG CLOSEUPS of: GORILLAS and ORANGUTANS
registering FEAR. Their mouths move constantly, quivering
salivating: their eyes, frightened, dart thie way and tha
and their faces - in their abject terror - grimace and
contort into obscene images.

STRANGE, METALLIC SOUNDS, and SUDDEN, INTERMITTENT FLASHES
of HARSH LIGHT rake their faces, momentarily blinding them
and adding to their fear, so that the incessant gibbering

and grunting increase in volume.

We WHIP PAN from one to the other, and back again with
hand-held Camera - OBLIQUE ANGLES, occasional LENS
DISTORTION, and MOOD LIGHTING heighten the nightmarish
quality of this sequence.

ZOOMING OUT STILL FURTHER we find that the half-crazed
animals are behind bare, cramped into what appears
(spacewise) a totally inadequate wooden crate or cage -
and an exceedingly unatable cage at that.

It WOBBLES and TILTS alarmingly, so that ita occupants,
losing their balance, stumble and bump against one another
slip and fall - in their pathetic efforts to retain
balance, their arms flail wildly and dangerously, so that
without intended malice, they hit one another with numerow
vicious punches.

Thies results in several ugly brawls of short. duration,

‘but horrible bloodshed is not far away.

Those who have fallen, trodden upon and kicked aside,
clutch and clew at those who are nearest in their efforts.
to regain their feet.

And as panic mounts, SNARLING turns to BITING:

SHOOTING THROUGH BARS. As the CAGE SWAYS and LUNGES
DOWNWARD, TILTING first this way, then that - the GORILLAS
and ORANGUTANS are hazy, fleeting blurs in the f.g. as the:
are tossed first to thig side, and then to the other.

Through the bars of the cage, nothing cen be seen except

Jet blackness (the night ia truly moonless).

Wow - as the cage continues its plunge earthward - a SION

tan be glimpsed, ill-illuminated and hard to decipher.

¢CCHING IN we just have time to discern what the sign says:

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE CAGE ko

SHOOTING UPWARDS as it descends. Its destination ia a
TRUCK; dimly (and only partially) revealed in the darkness:
what 16 apparent, though, is that the cage will only just
fit into the back of this vehicle.

ANOTHER ANGLE 43

ZOOMING THROUGH THE BLACKNESS into a corner at the rear
of the truck - we discover, crouched down low, Caesar -

looking apprehensively up at:
THE CAGE DESCENDING ky

Its speed, size, and weight is highly alarming - especially
to Caesar. .

Just when it seems nothing can save Caesar from being _
crushed to death - he decides to make a last-second dash
for it, and leap out the back of -the truck.

But he nas left it too late.

Halfway across the truck, Caesar realizes he cannot reach

his objective ~ the bottom of the swiftly descending cege

{is now but a few feet above him - and Caesar does the only
thing left open to him.

He hurls himself to the side, pressing himself flat against
tne woodwork,

Stmultaneously, the CAGE falls with a SICKENING THUMP -
its outer edge misses decapitating Caesar by inches.

Tne hysterical occupants squeal and gibber, and in. this
confined space the ruckus is CHILLING,

With no waste of time at all, the tailgate of the truck is
hoisted into position.

Again the CAGE trembles and shakes as the TRUCK atarte
upon its journey.

Gradually the grunts. squeals. and gibbertngs subside -
8 the occupants become aware of Caesar - and there is

Something about Caesar which disturbs them.

S-spiciously, one at a time, they gather at the bars of

ANGLE ON CAESAR 45
Pressed up against the side of the truck, and the cage.

Caesar slips his hand through the bars, pulls back a bolt,
then another, entera the cage, and rebolts it.

At this moment. the TRUCK now obviously traveling at speed
(we never see outside and we follow its progress by the
behavior of the cage) hits a large bump.

This throws the “inmates” off balance again -- all except
Caesar, who, of course, has hed the good sense to hang
onto a bar,

Caesar's face cannot help - albeit fleetingly - registering
@ modicum of contempt as he beholds his companions,
sprawling grotesquely on the floor,

He hurriedly passes the human washrooms and enters his own.
INT. APES' WASHROOM 166

A "grunting session” between Orangutans and Gorillas is in
progress. Caesar silences. them with an urgent gesture,
then hunkers down in the group's center beside a patch of
sawdust on the stone floor, and rapidly draws a sketch map
in the sawdust. He is giving his troops an Order of the ©
Day. He rises, points at the sketch, indicating with a
grunt that the others should study it. They grunt affirm-
atively, bend forward to look at the sketch, Caesar turns,
hurries out.

Caesar calmly turns, starts off in another direction...and
gees a Second Policeman. Still calm, Caesar makes off in
a third direction..,and sights a Third Policeman. Then,
imaitaneocusly, they move toward him. Realizing it is a
sap, Caesar tries to dash by them. The three Policemer :
atie him to the ground. As Kolp and Hoskyns appear |
