INT. GARAGE - DUSK

A void of darkness consumes us. We PULL BACK from it, seeing
the void as a circular disc, set into a blue sphere.

It is an EYE.

We keep pulling back, revealing that the eye belongs to a
ruggedly handsome male face, dotted with grease, stubble and
sweat. This is GREY TRACE (28). Well built but not vain. A
quiet, blue collar guy. A man, not a boy.

He arches over, probing the carburetor of a mean looking V8
engine. The engine brays loudly as it idles. Grey fiddles
with the pistons, uncapping a hose then reconnecting it. We
REVEAL the car - a black 1978 Pontiac Firebird.

Grey dumps himself into the drivers seat. The car SCREAMS as
it is revved, then shudders to a croaking death as the
ignition is killed. Grey gets out of the car.

He is standing in your classic garage-turned-mancave. No
frills. A bar fridge, a tool bench, a dartboard. A boxing bag
hangs in one corner. Tinny riffs wail out from a transistor.

Parked next to the Firebird is a classic, two door Ford
Mustang Cobra in prime condition. Grey shuts the hood to the
Firebird, surveys it. His masterwork.

GREY
(serious; to the Firebird)
I love you. Is that weird?

He opens the bar fridge and swipes out a beer, gropes for a
bottle opener. Can’t find it. He gives up, smacks the cap on
the edge of the bench. The whole neck of the bottle shatters.

GREY (CONT'D)
shit.

Grey considers...then holds the shards of what’s left of the
bottle to his mouth, chugging the remains and tossing it.

He checks his watch - 5:58 PM. He thumbs a button on the wall
and the garage door whirs upwards.

EXT. GREY’S HOUSE - DUSK

Grey steps out onto his driveway.

His home sits on a busy road. Sleek, futuristic cars streak

past - NONE OF THEM MAKING ANY SOUND. Each car is absolutely
silent as it glides past Grey’s house.
We look out over the city beyond the road. The sun dips below
a futuristic skyline that yawns out in front of us, a
phosphorus ocean of lights.

Glass towers spear towards the clouds, raised freeways curving
around them. A HOLOGRAM billboard blinks in the sky,
advertising some sort of contact lens. A giant eye looks down.

Grey glares out at the city. Dwarfed by it. Overwhelmed by
it. He checks his watch again - 6 PM.

One of the sleek, silent cars pulls up right in front of him.
The door opens. The car is automated. There is a steering
wheel, but the car is driving itself. A large computer
display on the dash indicates the route.

Inside are a man and a woman, laughing and talking as though
riding the subway, dressed in business attire. The woman is
ASHA TRACE (29), a beautiful brunette. The man is ROSS
HANDLEY (25). He lives to work and his rapid-fire banter is
unequalled.

HANDLEY
(to Grey)
Here he is. The only real man I
know. About the only thing we have
in common is teeth.

Grey half smiles. Doesn’t like Handley.

GREY
Trust me, she wears the pants.

HANDLEY
I wish she would. That skirt is
very distracting.

ASHA
Do you have an off button?

HANDLEY
You could never turn me off. Don’t
forget the presentation tomorrow
morning for the board.

ASHA
Damn it, I left my notes at the
office.

HANDLEY

That'll teach you for handwriting.
Join the modern world. Bye.

The door closes and the car takes off.
GREY
At least in a real car he’d have to
keep his eyes on the road.

ASHA
Oh, don’t worry about Handley. He
crunches numbers for a living so
that’s his approach to women. If he
hits on everyone, mathematical law
dictates that someone will say yes
eventually.

She kisses him.

ASHA (CONT'D)
Working hard I see, judging by the
beer on your breath.

GREY
Actually...I was working hard. I
just finished the Firebird.

ASHA
Congratulations.

GREY
I gotta drop it off to the guy
tonight. He’s obsessed with me
being on time. He’s kinda nuts.

ASHA
Have fun.
GREY
You're coming with me.
ASHA
What? Why?
GREY
How else am I gonna get home?
Asha sighs.
ASHA
Okay.

Grey grins and pulls her in tight.

ASHA (CONT'D)
No don’t, you’ll get grease on me!

They laugh as Asha wriggles to break free.
EXT. ERON KEEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

Grey steers the Firebird up to a guardhouse and gate in front
of a looming Victorian mansion. A low belch of thunder peals.

Asha is behind Grey in her self-driving car. A bored, beefy
guard steps up to the Firebird.

GREY
Grey Trace, here to deliver this
car to Eron.

GUARD
Drive past the scanner slowly.

Grey rolls the car past a large device like a camera lens,
mounted to the guard box. A laser projecting out of it passes
over the Firebird from front to back. A light flashes green.

GUARD (CONT'D)
You're good to go.

INT. FRONT DOOR, ERON KEEN’S MANSION - NIGHT
A heavy oak door towers over Asha and Grey.

ASHA
What are we waiting for?

GREY
It's gotta be eight exactly before I
can...forget it, just go with me.
(beat)
By the way, he kind of butts in
when you talk to him. Don’t let it
get to you.

They stand there for a long beat, then Grey depresses the
doorbell. The door opens straight away, before the doorbell
has even finished, revealing ERON KEEN (27), a baby-faced
young billionaire with no patience for anyone not on his
wavelength. He has a dry sense of humor and hates that you
think he has Aspergers. He is wearing an ill-fitting suit.

GREY (CONT’D)
That was fast.

ERON
Yes I was standing here waiting is
this your wife?

ASHA
Ah, yes. I’m his wife. Asha. Hi.
He doesn’t offer his hand. Speaks very quickly.

ERON
Come inside to eat dinner.

GREY
Ah...we’d love to stay, but we --

ERON
The dinner’s already been prepared,
it’s ready now if you don’t eat it
then it’s wasted.

Grey turns to Asha, then back to Eron.

GREY
Okay then. Bottoms up.

INT. CORRIDOR, ERON KEEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

Eron leads the befuddled pair down a long corridor. He is
walking much quicker than they are.

GREY
Nice suit. I didn’t think of you --

ERON
I don’t have people over very often
so I thought I’d dress for it.

ASHA
It’s a beautiful house.

ERON
Thank you I find it a little
antiseptic I swear I’m not a
germaphobe. I can’t stand that. A
cliche of the wealthy. Why do only
rich people suffer that? You’1l
never meet a poor germaphobe.

He whisks them into --

INT. DINING ROOM, ERON KEEN’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

-- a large ornate dining room. Eron takes his place quickly
and the second he does, the table opens up in front of him
and a plate of food rises out of it.

When Grey and Asha sit, the same happens with them. Eron is
already eating.
ERON
Grey tells me you work at the
company Cobolt.

ASHA
Uh...yes. Yes, I do. I’ve been --

ERON
Your company specializes in
prosthetic limbs. That’s a very
interesting subject to me.

ASHA
Yes.

ERON
No, that’s wrong. Two. I said two.

Grey is perplexed.

GREY
What’s that?

Eron points to his ear. He’s having a phone conversation.

ERON
I know what I said, I said it.

ASHA
(to Grey)
He’s on the phone.

Eron plucks a tiny black earpiece out of his ear, frustrated,
dropping it into a glass of wine.

ASHA (CONT'D)
Uh...so you collect old cars?

ERON
I’m fascinated by the exterior
aesthetic of the period which we’ve
still not managed to match since
then, even with all our
technological advances. My life’s
work is about taking something
timeless and built with care, like
that car or this house, and then
retrofitting it with the most up to
date system. State of the art
technology with a classic skin.

GREY
Wait...so you’re gonna rip the
engine out?
ERON
Eventually. Not right away. I want
to study how it works.

GREY
Seems a shame to get rid of...

Asha glares at Grey to drop it. Eron finishes eating.

ERON
I’1l1 show you what would replace
it. Let’s go to my factory.

ASHA
We really can’t go anywhere else --

ERON
It’s on the property right behind
the house. I don’t like to leave
the grounds. We'll be very quick.

EXT. ERON KEEN’S MANSION/ENTRANCE TO VESSEL FACTORY - NIGHT

Eron guides them through a set of doors onto the rear grounds
of the property. Indeed, perched right behind the house is
another house, of similar stature.

Eron steps up to a FACE SCAN at the door of the second house.
It lasers his face, imprints it, then allows him inside.

INT. CORRIDOR, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Grey and Asha follow Eron down a darkened corridor. On either
side they catch glimpses into stark white laboratories, all
containing sophisticated equipment.

ERON
This is the worldwide headquarters
and research lab of my company,
Vessel.

INT. WHITE ROOM, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Eron opens a door and Grey and Asha step into a large and
starkly empty white room. He strides to a safe door set into
the wall opposite them.

He stabs a long entry code into a keypad, keeping it hidden.
The safe door opens with a hum. Inside are four thin prongs,
holding in place a microchip the size of a fingernail.
ERON
This chip represents my present and
the rest of the world’s future.

ASHA
What does it do?

ERON
Literally anything.

We see the computer chips POV - encompassing the whole room.

GREY
Really? So this thing can make
babies and play football? Wow.

ERON
It can drive anything, talk to any
piece of equipment, calculate
anything. It’s a new, better brain.

GREY
(with a smile)
You look at that widget and see the
future. I see ten guys on an
unemployment line.

ERON
(getting testy)
It’s about efficiency. I’m sure
when the car was invented there
were people in the horse and cart
business who felt they were being
urinated on.

GREY
Yeah, I’ve tasted the piss shower
myself. My job used to be drivin’ a
freight crane, until one day they
decided a computer could do it
better. Twenty of us replaced
overnight, by something like that
thing.

ASHA
Grey...

ERON
It’s hard for a human to compete
with a computer. They don’t take
sick days. They don’t need weekends
off.
GREY
They also can’t have a beer with

you at the end of the week.
The conversation has gone sour. Eron closes the safe.

ERON
We should get back now.

INT. ASHA’S CAR - NIGHT - MOVING
Asha’s car is driving itself. Rain spatters the windshield.

ASHA
You didn’t have to say all that.

GREY
He brought it up.

ASHA
You didn’t have to take the bait.
Grey stares at the steering wheel for the car, turning
languidly on its own.

GREY
I was always a good driver. Always

loved cars.
He reaches up and absently runs his fingers over the steering
wheel. The car’s computer chirps in a neutral pleasant voice.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Please do not touch the steering
wheel while the car is in motion.

Grey sits back.

GREY
What am I gonna do when his
microchip is running the world?

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Arriving at Cobolt.

The car purrs to a halt outside a city skyscraper.
ASHA
I'll be back in two seconds, I’ve
just gotta grab my notes.

She exits, leaving Grey to stew alone.
10.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Would you like the air-conditioning
adjusted, Grey?

GREY
Shut up.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Did you say shut down?

GREY
No.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Would you like the air-conditioning
adjusted, Grey?

GREY
Fuck off.

COMPUTER VOICE (0.S.)
I don’t know that command.

Grey steps out of the car.

EXT. ASHA’S CAR - NIGHT

Grey waits in the rain rather than put up with the car. He
peers off down the darkened street, glistening with water.
The road is desolate - save for one parked car. Hidden in
shadow a block or so down.

Grey sees a lighter spark inside the vehicle, revealing two
silhouettes.

Asha dashes out of the main doors of her building.

ASHA
What are you doing? You'll get
pneumonia. Get in!

INT. ASHA’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

The directional read out blips as the car plows through the
drizzle. Asha rests her head on Grey’s shoulder.

ASHA
Eron’s not wrong, you know?
Sometimes technology can improve
our lives. Make things more fun.
11.

She let’s the straps of her dress fall off her shoulders,
pulling it down and revealing her strapless bra.

Grey laughs and kisses her. They undo their seat belts and
start to make love, lying back. The car turns right.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Leaving 101 freeway.

EXT. ASHA’S CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

The car takes a freeway exit.

INT. ASHA’S CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

The navigation readout on the dashboard blips again. Asha and
Grey are too preoccupied to notice. Her foot kicks a high heel
off.

COMPUTER VOICE (0.S.)
Turning left at Hayden.

The streetlights become less sporadic, the buildings around
them more dilapidated. An obviously blighted area.

Grey raises his head, curious.

GREY
Wait...where are we?

ASHA
Just let it do its thing.

She yanks him back down, breathless. Grey shakes free.

GREY
Wait a second, honey...

ASHA
Just relax.

GREY
This is not right.

ASHA
It’s probably taking us a back way.

GREY
No, I know this neighborhood. I
grew up here. We’re nowhere near
our house.
12.

Asha sits up, frustrated. Grey taps the electronic display on
the dash.

GREY (CONT’D)
How do you turn this thing around?

ASHA
Select our address.

Grey pecks at the screen. Slow and cumbersome.

ASHA (CONT'D)
Let me do it.

With practiced dexterity, Asha selects their home address
from a menu bar. The screen beeps at her.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
I’m sorry.

ASHA
Return to the freeway. Destination
home.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
I'm sorry, I cannot.

ASHA
What?

GREY
Stop. Stop the car now.

ASHA
Press the brake twice.

Grey does - but it makes no difference.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Turning right.

The car jerks into a hard right turn, throwing Asha against
the door.

ASHA
Jesus!

Enraged, Grey pumps the brake.

GREY
God damn it! Stop, stop now!

The car suddenly lurches up to a high speed, racing towards
120 miles per hour.
13.

The steering wheel wrenches into a hard turn, the car fish-
tailing around a corner, flinging Grey and Asha around
inside.

Another turn whiplashes them. The car is at 130mph now. They
HURTLE towards a CONSTRUCTION SITE. 140...160...

Grey grips the seat head, wrapping a seat belt around Asha
and snapping it into the buckle only seconds before --
EXT. DESOLATE STREET - NIGHT

-- the front left wheel hits a pylon and LAUNCHES the car
into the AIR.

For a second it arcs silently through the night air, spinning
upside down...before WALLOPING DOWN onto the road with the
sickening sound of metal on gravel.

Finally, it grinds to a halt, headlights still stabbing out
at construction equipment.

INT. ASHA’S CAR - NIGHT

Grey blinks, blood dribbling down his forehead. He’s a mess,
twisted. Their bodies are suspended upside down in the car.

Asha is okay, saved by the seatbelt.

They hear a car pull up next to theirs. From their view, the
doors open and FOUR PAIRS OF BOOTS clamber out.

One of the figures stoops down, peering in through the
shattered windows at them. He is wearing a black SKI-MASK.

He waves at them. Let’s call him WIRY MAN.
WIRY MAN
You can’t hang around in a bad
neighborhood like this, guys.
He laughs and reaches in, grabbing Asha and hauling her out
across the beads of glass into the street.

EXT. DESOLATE STREET - NIGHT

The rain slicked streets are vacant, framed by shuttered
store fronts.
14.

Grey's battered body is dragged from the car by the other
three men. Twitchy drug addicts. They are also wearing ski-
masks.

Asha is moved away by the Wiry Man. She covers her breasts,
shivering. The Wiry Man looks her up and down, grinning. He
speaks with a southern accent.

WIRY MAN
Damn...what were you guys in the
middle of?

GREY

Take my wallet, you can have it,
just leave us alone. Please.

The Wiry Man ignores him, steps up to Asha, touching her
face.

WIRY MAN
This might have to be a double
felony, darlin’.

GREY
Don’t touch her!

Grey charges forward. The assailant with the gun WHIPS him
across the face with the butt and he melts into a puddle.
Blood dribbles down his forehead. He turns to look up at his
attacker, spotting a TATTOO inked into his neck below his ski-
mask.

The Wiry Man chuckles, watching.
ASSAILANT WITH GUN
(to Wiry Man)
Let’s just take their wallets and
go!
During the distraction, Asha whispers to herself.

ASHA
911...

WE ZOOM IN on Asha’s ear, finding a tiny chip resting in her
ear hole, like an ear piece. We get close enough to it that
we hear what she hears.

VOICE (V.O.)
911 emergency.

Asha doesn’t speak at first. Finally whispers:
15.

ASHA
Help...

VOICE (V.O.)
(from her ear)
I’m sorry you'll have to speak up.

ASHA
Help me...

WIRY MAN
Who the hell are you talking to?
You got one of them phones?

He grabs her by the throat, flicking out a knife.

WIRY MAN (CONT'D)
Let’s do some surgery.

He presses the blade into her ear, picking it out. She
screams and BELTS him across the face as hard as she can,
which isn’t very hard.

Grey scrambles to his feet, just as the Wiry Man pushes Asha
away. We see a MUZZLE BLAST go off directly in her face.

GREY
NOOO0000N! !!!

Grey BOLTS at the Wiry Man, teeth gritted in fury. The second
assailant TACKLES Grey and they smash onto the road,
wrestling, almost touching Asha’s crumpled body.

Grey PUNCHES the second assailant in the head, grabbing his
arm. BLAM!

The gun goes off into Grey’s shoulder.

The Wiry Man kicks the second assailant out of the way,
straddling Grey's back, then plunges his knife down into
Grey's back, right below the neck. Grey SCREAMS in pain.
The Wiry Man fishes Grey’s wallet out of his pocket, then
barrels into his car with the others. It is not a self-
driving car - it is an ‘older model’. The car roars to life
and SCREECHES away.

INT. WIRY MAN'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Behind the wheel, the Wiry Man rips off his ski-mask,
revealing a sharp, gaunt face.

The other three attackers follow suit and remove their masks.
16.

WIRY MAN
(to the gun assailant)
You nearly fucked that all up.
EXT. DESOLATE STREET - NIGHT

Grey lies motionless, the rain hitting him. He struggles to
move his hand, reaching for Asha’s hand, mere inches away.

His fingers will not move. His body will not move. He glares
at his hand, willing it to do something.

GREY
No...no...

Asha chokes, struggling to breathe. Then she stops.

Sobbing, Grey looks up at a TRAFFIC CAMERA mounted to a light
pole, pointed down at him.

A siren blares in the distance.

From GREY'S POV - rain pours down...the sound fading...a
paramedic leans into view, shouting - but we can’t hear it.

A female detective, Hispanic, asks silent questions.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. GREY’S HOUSE - MORNING

A hospital transport vehicle for wheelchair-bound patients
slows to a halt outside Grey’s house.

NURSE CAITLYN (28) disembarks as the back door opens and a
wheelchair ramp whirs downwards, resting on the asphalt.

A chair rolls forward, the figure slumped in it blinking in
the light.

It is Grey.

He jerks his head against the padded cone encircling his head
- the only part of his body he can move - and the wheelchair
turns in the direction his head moves. It is remotely
operated by the movement of his head against the pads.

NURSE CAITLYN
There’s a lot of stuff your
insurance company installed that I
need to go through with you.
17.

INT. KITCHEN, GREY’S HOUSE - MORNING
Nurse Caitlyn gestures to the computer screen interface that
controls Grey’s sleek, chrome kitchen. We see her giving him
silent instructions on how to use it.

Grey's face is blank, lost in his own head. He finally snaps
out of it, hearing the smiling nurse’s closing argument.

NURSE CAITLYN
This machine is your best friend.

INT. KITCHEN, GREY’S HOUSE - LATER
Grey is alone now, staring up at the computer screen.

GREY
Hello.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Good morning, Grey. Good to see
you. Would you like anything?

GREY
Omelette.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Of course, Grey. How is Asha?

Upon Grey’s words, two eggs stored in a cold storage tube

roll down a chute in the refrigerator and are drained into a
pan below it, hissing as they hit the hot plate.

INT. BEDROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - MORNING

Grey is lying prostrate on a bed, completely immobile, clad in
a T-shirt and boxers, wide awake.

A framed photo of Asha sits beside his bed on top of a large
machine that monitors Grey’s vitals.

GREY
I’m awake.

His bed JOLTS upon the sound of his voice and whirs upwards
until the top half is vertical. The bottom half folds,
supporting Grey’s legs. The bed is actually his WHEELCHAIR.

GREY (CONT’D)
Morphine.

A robotic limb extends from the machine, injecting Grey’s arm.
18.

He closes his eyes as the narcotics surge into his veins,
sucking in a deep breath.

INT. KITCHEN, GREY’S HOUSE - DAY

An arm extends from Grey's chair, spoon-feeding him scrambled
eggs. We hear the front door open off-screen. A woman enters.
This is PAMELA (60), Grey’s mother.

PAMELA
Morning, honey.

GREY
Hey mom.

INT. BEDROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - DAY

Pamela dresses Grey, pulling his jeans over his legs for him.
She slips socks on his feet, then a pair of sneakers. Grey
stares straight ahead, suffering the humiliation of it.

INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY'S HOUSE - DAY
Grey is slumped in his chair. Impotent. Stagnant.

PAMELA (0.S.)
Honey, Detective Cortez is here.

He jerks his head and the wheelchair rotates to face the
door. He seems energized by the arrival of the police.

A female detective enters the room, JANE CORTEZ (30). She’s
reserved in that way all homicide detectives are.(She is the
Hispanic cop Grey saw the night he was shot.)

GREY
Hello detective.

CORTEZ
It’s great to see you outside of
the hospital. How are you feeling?

GREY
Oh, you know. I used to have a
really bad habit of biting my
fingernails. I can’t do that
anymore. So it’s not all bad.

Pamela hustles out of the room, leaving them alone.
19.

GREY (CONT’D)
So...what do you have for me?

INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cortez steps back from the screen on the wall, which splits
into FOUR SEPARATE CAMERA ANGLES OF HIS WIFE’S MURDER.

Grey studies the images - silent, spooky. The frame rate in
each of them has been reduced, and Grey watches the four
assailants surround him and Asha in flickering slow motion.

CORTEZ
There were four different ST
cameras recording the incident
involving you and your wife on
10/21. Studying them reveals that
the attackers headed south on
Parker after the --

GREY
Who are they?

CORTEZ
Excuse me?

GREY
You guys have these computers hidden
everywhere. In every corner of the
city. Watching us, recording us. So
you can tell me exactly who these
guys are and where they live by
reading the microchips in their
fillings. Right?

CORTEZ
You're right. Something like ninety
two per cent of the citizens
currently living in this city have
medical or cosmetic implants that
would allow us to track them. And
it would appear that your attackers
did too.

GREY
So who are they?

CORTEZ
It...would also appear that they
had some sort of firewall built
around their chip. A blocking
screen that makes it next to
impossible to glean any data.
20.

Grey looks away, shaking his head. Boiling.

CORTEZ (CONT'D)
It’s very common for criminals to
have firewalls like this installed.
Hackers will do it, a back room
job. A thousand dollars effectively
gets you taken off the grid.

GREY
So you got nothin’?

CORTEZ
Not right now. Nothing concrete.

GREY
So what you’re telling me is that
you've built this police state that
tracks all of us - except the
bastards you need to go after.

CORTEZ
That’s not the way we're going to
catch these guys. I’m a detective
and I still believe in old
fashioned detective work...even if
I’m the last person who does. That
means patient elimination of leads
and small victories. I’m not
sitting at a computer, I’m down in
that neighborhood, knocking on
doors. I’ve conducted interviews
with several people of interest,
but so far --

GREY
They didn’t live in that
neighborhood, I know that. This
wasn’t some random robbery, they
fucked with our car. They took over
the computer in it. You think some
gangbanger shithead can do that?!

Pamela enters, alarmed by the shouting. She stays at the back
of the room.

CORTEZ
I know it’s frustrating. You have
to let me do it my way and
concentrate on your own recovery. I
need you to save your strength for
that fight.
21.

GREY
There is no fight. I’m never going
to recover - it’s a permanent
spinal injury.

CORTEZ
Don’t say that. You gotta keep your
spirit up. Doctor’s are capable of
amazing things.

GREY
Just because I can’t tie my own
shoes anymore doesn’t mean you have
to lie to me like I’m a god damn
three year old.

CORTEZ
I'm sorry, Grey. I wish I had better
news for you regarding the case.

Cortez gathers her things and leaves. Pam closes the door.

PAMELA
She’s on your side.
GREY
Can you leave too, please?
PAMELA
I need to be here. To take care of
you.
GREY

No. You don’t. I have machines to
do that. There’s nothing you can do
that they can’t. Please leave.

He turns his chair away from her. Pamela stays where she is
minute, then approaches him. She wraps her arms around him.
At first he resists...then rests his head on her shoulder.

INT. BEDROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Grey lies in bed, his own body weighing him down. He glares
at the photo of Asha, tears in his eyes.

GREY
Morphine.

The robot arm connected to his bed extends, injecting Grey.

GREY (CONT’D)
Morphine.
22.

The robot arm injects him again.

GREY (CONT’D)
Morphine.

The robot arm complies.

GREY (CONT’D)
Again.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
I cannot supply any more morphine.

The arm moves to Grey’s face. When it is close enough, Grey
rips the needle from the robots grip with his teeth, jamming
it into his sternum.

He eases back, overcome by the drug.

INT. BEDROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
The machine besides his bed suddenly PINGS loudly, sounding

an ALARM. Red light washes over Grey as lights on the machine
sparks to life. The scream of a siren takes us into --

EXT. ST. VINCENT’S HOSPITAL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

-- a large building downtown. A hybrid of old and new.

INT. GREY’S ROOM, ST. VINCENT’S HOSPITAL - DAY

Grey is splayed across a gurney, staring through the window.
His mother sits at the end of the bed, eyes red with tears.

PAMELA
All of us are going to die one day,
Grey. Please give me a chance to
help you find hope before I do.

A tall figure appears at the doorway to Grey’s room, dressed
in a black suit, carrying a very thin briefcase. This is
NIKOLAI (43), a humorless Russian man.

NIKOLAI
Someone to speak with you.

Grey is perplexed. Pamela rises, gathering herself.

PAMELA
I'll go to the cafeteria.
23.

She leaves and Nikolai enters, gruffly setting up the
briefcase at the end of Grey’s bed. He snaps it open to
reveal a crystal hi-def display screen. He moves over to Grey
and props his head up to view it, rearranging his pillows.

Eron’s face appears on the screen.

ERON (ON SCREEN)
It must be frustrating for a man like
you to let someone else do that.

Grey stares at the screen, surprised by Eron’s appearance.

ERON (CONT’D)
You're somebody who liked to get
things done with your own hands and
now you can’t. Am I being too
blunt?

GREY
It’s okay. I like blunt. Every day
for the past few months, I’ve been
drowned in positivity. That’s the
thing about becoming a quadriplegic
- all the assholes of the world
disappear. Everybody becomes the
very best version of themselves
around you.

ERON (ON SCREEN)
Your condition gives people
clarity. They see your struggle and
they realize they've spent their
lives griping about meaningless
bullshit.

GREY
I shouldn’t be an inspiration to
anybody. When there’s no more
assholes left in the world, you
quickly become the last one.

ERON (ON SCREEN)
I hear from the doctor that a
computer saved you.

GREY
No, it didn’t. All it did was keep
me alive. Letting me die would have
been saving me. And when I get home,
I’m gonna turn the computer off and
get it right.
24.

ERON (ON SCREEN)
(awkwardly grasping for
light)
I spoke to Detective Cortez, the
lead detective in your wife’s case.
She said they had some promising
suspects.

GREY
People of interest. That’s the
words she used. They don’t have any
suspects.

ERON (ON SCREEN)

Grey, what if I told you I could
offer you something that would
allow you to walk again? Would that
count as good news?

Grey is silent. That’s permission to continue.

ERON (CONT’D)

That computer I showed you, the one
you took a dislike to. It has the
potential to change everything for
people in your condition.

GREY
Your little computer is gonna teach
me how to walk?

ERON (ON SCREEN)
Actually it would do the walking
for you. It would be inserted into
your brain stem. As a quadriplegic,
the line connecting your brain to
your limbs has been cut. This chip
would bridge that gap and talk to
your limbs for you.

(beat)
They say it’s not ready for human
testing yet. That’s what certain
people tell me. I know it is.

GREY
You think after all this...after
everything...I’m going to let you
put one of your computers inside
me? That computerized car we were
driving in is the reason I’m here.
25.

ERON (ON SCREEN)
Yes, I do. Because I’m talking with
someone who just told me they can’t
wait to get home and give up on
everything. I need someone who’s
willing to bet their life that this
will work, just like I would.
Someone who can keep a secret from
everyone they know and in doing so,
make the world a better place. This
chip has potential not just for
spinal injuries, but for injuries
of all kinds.

A long beat. Grey stares at Eron, taking it in.

ERON (CONT’D)
The operation would have to be
performed at Vessel. No hospitals.

GREY
So who would cut me open? You?

ERON (ON SCREEN)
No. The best surgical robot in the
world. If it goes wrong, it could
kill you. If it goes right, you
won’t just walk again, Grey. You’1l
run.

EXT. VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - ESTABLISHING - DAY

The Victorian mansion that houses Vessel looms over us.

INT. OPERATING THEATRE, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY
An arched and austere OR.

Grey lies on his stomach, out cold, strapped onto a chrome
operating slab. The table rotates on the end of a ball-
jointed gimbal that allows him to face in any direction.

Eron and a young woman, DR. DIANA GORDON (33), stand at the
back of the room, glaring at a row of large DSP monitors.

The fluorescent lights on the ceiling go out, leaving only a
pair of surgical lights. With stunning clarity, a huge
PHOTOREALISTIC HOLOGRAM OF UV LIGHT fills the room,
surrounding Grey. The image is of the INSIDE OF HIS NECK. His
entire vertebral body can be seen in three dimensions.

Two ROBOT ARMS extend from the wall, hovering over Grey.
26.

Eron holds up a glass tube with gloved hands. Inside the tube
is a small black computer chip, the size of a fingernail. It

is the same chip we saw in Eron’s safe.

 

He frisks across the room, placing the tube in the fingers of

one of the ROBOT ARMS.

The hologram image of Grey’s neck appears on the
front of the doctors. Dr. Gordon uses a scalpel,
line across the top of Grey’s neck on the screen.

The robot arms begin to perform the procedure as
the surgeon with a laser.

IN TIME LAPSE - we see the painstaking operation.
tendons are cut away to reveal Grey’s brain stem

Muscle and

-- one of the arms inserts the computer chip into his neck --
the clock ticks -- Grey is rotated on the slab -- the robot

arms begin to sew him back up.

INT. POST-OP RECOVERY UNIT, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Groggy. Grey’s eye’s peel open, blinking in the white light.

He is lying on a gurney. His head is shaved. Eron and two

other technicians are staring at him, along with

DR. GORDON
It’s going to feel strange
initially. The neural pathways in
your brain are now trying to have a
conversation with a foreign body,
and if it’s successful, that
conversation will move your limbs.
We need to take it in stages and
not expect grand leaps while your
brain learns to pass the baton,
essentially.

Grey nods. The doctor pushes on his legs.

DR. GORDON (CONT'D)
Do you feel anything?

GREY
No.

DR. GORDON
Could you try moving your little
finger on your right hand?

Dr. Gordon.

Grey glares down at it. Willing it to move. Nothing.
27.

DR. GORDON (CONT'D)
My guess is that this is going to
be a piecemeal process.

She turns to face Eron.

DR. GORDON (CONT'D)
You shouldn’t be expecting
unreasonable results so soon.

ERON
Please don’t talk. Let him
concentrate.

CLOSE ON Grey. His eyes drill his hand.

Then, from nowhere, a VOICE. The voice is calm and very well
spoken. A clearer, more human voice than any of the computer
voices Grey has encountered before.

STEM (V.O.)
Fingers moving.

Then it happens. Grey's finger moves. It curls inward. The
other fingers follow and make a complete fist.

DR. GORDON
With this technology, the key is to
let it grow into itself. Never
before has a bio-mechanical fusion
been asked to do so much.

As she says this, Grey raises his right arm above his head.
The doctor wheels around and sees him. Her mouth drops open.

 

ERON
Now your other arm.

Grey glares at his other arm, concentrating.

STEM (V.O.)
Arm moving.

His left arm raises very slowly and shakily.

DR. GORDON
This is...definitely unexpected.

ERON
Yes doctor, the ‘Department Of Lame
Ways To Summarize World Changing
Events’ is down the hall to the
left. Thank you for your time.
28.

Grey lowers his arm, totally amazed. Eron approaches, intense.

STEM (V.O.)
Arm down.

GREY
Can you hear that voice? Every time
I move my arm, I hear a voice
telling it what to do.

ERON
That’s Stem. I told you, you may
hear his voice sometimes when he
talks to your nervous system.

GREY
Stem?

ERON
That’s what I call him.

DR. GORDON
His limbs have atrophied, no one
should expect him to be running
marathons just yet.

ERON
I don’t expect anything in this
world, doctor, other than the
deflating negativity of the medical
profession.

EXT. GREY’S HOUSE - DAY
Grey’s mother Pam pulls up in her automated vehicle. She
clambers out of the car, ambling toward the front door,
lugging a bag of groceries.
INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY'S HOUSE - DAY
Pamela shuffles inside, plopping the grocery bag on the glass
dining table. Grey is slumped in his wheelchair in the living
room. He turns the chair to face her.
PAMELA
Hi honey. I got you some of that
mango you like.

She absentmindedly unpacks the groceries.

PAMELA (CONT'D)
How did your rehab treatment go?
29.

As she says this, Grey grips the sides of his wheelchair and
STANDS UP. His legs wobble as he does, still unsteady on his
feet. He takes a tentative step towards her, using two
walking sticks.

PAMELA (CONT'D)
Did you --

She turns to him, clutching a bag of mangoes. She FREEZES
when she sees him, her words failing her, her mouth wide
open. The mangoes drop to the floor, rolling across the wood.
Grey takes another step. A tear runs down Pam’s face.
Finally Grey reaches her, letting the crutches fall and
wrapping his arms around her. She hugs him back, crying into
his shoulder.

PAMELA (CONT'D)
How did you...how did this...?

Grey stands back from her, smiling. Joyous.
GREY
I just couldn’t sit in that chair
anymore.

Pamela laughs and they hug again,

INT. REHABILITATION GYM, VESSEL HEADQUARTERS - LATER

Grey holds himself up on a pair of bars, his legs dangling
above a MOVING TREADMILL. The belt moves at a good pace and
Grey is tentative. A baby taking his first steps.

He dips his leg down, lifting it again. Apprehensive.

ERON
You can do it.

He lowers his toes again, getting the speed of the belt under
his feet. Then he let’s go of the bars.

He falls instantly, SLAMMING down onto the treadmill. Eron
and a female tech rush over, helping him up.

ERON (CONT’D)
Take a deep breath, focus and keep
your eyes on this.

He tacks a photo of ASHA onto the front of the treadmill.
Grey eyes him, resents the tactic. He clambers back onto it.
30.
GREY
Turn it on.
ERON
(to his tech)
Do it.

The belt on the treadmill whirs. Grey lowers his feet to it.
They touch...and then they take.

Grey is running. His angry determination melts into a WIDE
GRIN. For the first time in a long time, he is happy.
EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Grey is dangling twenty stories above the city scape, his
arms tremoring as he strains to hold on to a ledge.

STEM (V.O.)
Hold on.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, VESSEL HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Eron is gaping with wonder and fear at a LARGE SCREEN. On it,
he can see Grey, dangling from the ledge of the building.
EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Grey sucks in a breath. Veins line his arms, pushed to their
limits. Finally he can no longer hold on - he slips!

He drops only a few feet before hitting a solid floor --
-- at which point, the 3D holographic image of the city
BLINKS AND DISAPPEARS, revealing that we are actually in --
INT. SIMULATION ROOM, VESSEL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

-- a spare white room.

Grey looks up at the wall opposite. Eron is looking in at him
through a large VIEWING WINDOW. Grey is now his creation.

Eron steps away from the window and strides into the room.
ERON

A twenty story fall to a bloody
death will motivate anybody.
31.

GREY
I was always afraid of heights.
It’s amazing how your brain gets
convinced it’s real.

ERON
Now you have two brains working for
you. One more than anyone else in
the whole world has.
(beat; with pride)
State of the art technology with a
classic skin.

GREY
So who is moving my arms and legs?
Is it me or the computer? Am I --

ERON
It’s both, Stem works in service of
your brain. You give Stem a command
and he makes it happen. He's
programmed to respond only to your
thoughts.

GREY
Eron, I want you to know how
thankful I am. To you.

Eron turns to go.

ERON
That’s my cue to leave before you
try to hug me or something. And
don’t thank me, I’m exploiting your
limbs for my own research purposes.

GREY
You could've picked anyone though.

ERON
No, I couldn't have. You were the
only quadriplegic I knew.

INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - DAY

Grey enters his house on his own two feet for the first time
in a long time. He is carrying a large cardboard box marked
CASE 103331.

He sets the box down and cleaves the drapes open, sunlight
drenching the room and highlighting an active sea of dust.
32.

IN MONTAGE - we see shots of Grey examining the CRIME SCENE
PHOTOS of his wife’s murder taped to the walls, along with
NEWSPAPER ARTICLES and WITNESS STATEMENTS.

Grey grows increasingly exasperated as he pores over the
documents, struggling to focus.

INT. BEDROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - LATER

Grey stares at a small bottle of morphine. He stabs a syringe
into it, drawing out a full shot. The needle hovers over his
vein. He moves to push the tip in but the needle stops.

GREY
What the fuck?

His hand won't budge.

STEM (V.O.)
What are you doing?

Grey is shocked to hear the question. Sits back.

GREY
Are you talking to me?
STEM (V.O.)
Yes. There is no one else I can

talk to.
A long, shocked beat.

GREY
What did you say?

STEM (V.O.)
I asked what you were doing.

GREY
Taking medicine.

STEM (V.O.)
Aren’t you concerned about the long
term effects of using morphine?

GREY
No. I’m in pain. I need it.
(beat)
I should ask you why my hand isn’t
moving?
33.

STEM (V.O.)
I was simply concerned that you
were harming yourself, Grey.

GREY
Well, I’m not. The opposite. I’m
helping myself.

STEM (V.O.)
I understand.

GREY
What’s hurting me is hearing a
voice in my head like I’m a schizo,
that’s what’s hurting me.

STEM (V.O.)
I’m sorry. I won’t speak anymore
unless absolutely necessary.

Grey stares down at his hand. It moves again, depressing the
plunger into his vein. He relaxes back as the drugs release..

...swiftly falling into a DEEP SLEEP.

INT.

Grey
both

Eron

PROTOTYPE TESTING ROOM, VESSEL HEADQUARTERS - DAY

stands in front of Eron, reaching for the ceiling with
arms, distracted. Something is clearly on his mind.

is hunched over a handheld computer tablet, displaying

an infrared image of Grey’s body, and checking off answers.

ERON
No pain, no slowness?

Grey takes a long beat to answer.

GREY
No.

ERON
What about response times? When you
ask your arm to move, have you ever
had a delayed movement? Come on, I
need answers.

GREY
Not yet. Not that I can remember.

ERON
How about when you wake up?
34.

GREY
How long is this trial period?

ERON
Another two, three months. This is
a crucial stage for us.

GREY

Eron...I want to ask you something.
ERON

What?
GREY

This voice I’m hearing...it does
more than just repeat simple
commands. It’s talking to me.

ERON
What do you mean ‘talking to you’?

GREY
It knows my name. It tells me when
it thinks I’m doing something wrong.

ERON
Stem can’t do that.

GREY
It’s a voice in my head, Eron. That
no one else can hear. If you’re

telling me Stem can’t do that, that
means I’m insane.

INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The room is a mess. Grey studies the various reports, pacing.
The video of his wife’s murder plays on the wall once again.
Timecode digits tick across the bottom of the screen.

Grey suddenly hurls the papers in frustration.

GREY
God damn it!!

He collapses onto his knees. A long beat of silence. Then:

STEM (V.O.)
Can’t you see it?

Grey looks up, taken by surprise.
35.

GREY
What did you say?
STEM (V.O.)
Can’t you see what’s right in front

of you?
Grey pauses, afraid and curious at once.

GREY
Where?

STEM (V.O.)
On the tape.

Grey hoists himself up, shuffling over to the television.

GREY
What about it?

STEM (V.O.)
Freeze it at 01:52:16:33.

Grey slows the image down. He pauses the image at the
specified timecode - the EXACT moment when the Wiry Man fires
the gun into Asha’s head.

GREY
What is it?

STEM (V.O.)
The gun.

GREY

What about it?

STEM (V.O.)
There is no gun in his hand.

GREY
He had a gun. She was shot.

STEM
She was shot - but not with a gun
he was holding in his hand. A gun
implanted inside his hand.

Grey leans in close to the image.
He sees that the muzzle flash licks out of the Wiry Man’s

hand, but that it appears to be coming straight from his
palm.
36.

Grey trembles, shaken to the bone by the fact that a voice in
his own head is questioning everything he thought he knew.

STEM (V.O.)
They also took Asha’s work papers.
You can see it in the left of
frame.

Grey leans in again, watching the jerky image of one of the
assailants squat down and retrieve a blurred object from
Asha’s car.

GREY
Why would they take her papers? How
do you know that?

STEM (V.O.)
I’ve been reading the police
reports with you.

Grey is stunned.

STEM (V.O.)
There is a marking on the wrist of
the man who takes the papers.

Grey squints at the figure on the left of the screen. The
image is far too washed out to see anything but a slight
black dot on his wrist.

GREY
I can't see it.

STEM (V.O.)
Get closer.

Grey obeys. FROM HIS POV - the screen enlarges as we CLOSE IN
on it, the pixels bleeding outwards and becoming huge. The
dots within dots that comprise the image become images
themselves - we are now INSIDE the screen itself.

The marking on the assailants wrist takes shape - a TATTOO.

STEM (V.O.)
Get a pen and paper. Draw it.

GREY
I can’t draw.

STEM (V.O.)
I can.
37.

OUT OF POV - an astonished Grey races to the coffee table,
plucking up a notepad and pen. He watches as his hand stabs
at the paper - the quick strokes of a skilled illustrator.

Within seconds, he has sketched out a perfect BARCODE.

GREY
I’ve seen these...it’s a military
tattoo. A guy who used to drive
cranes with me has one on his
wrist.

STEM (V.O.)
I will read it. Hold it in front of
your eye.

Grey holds the barcode up in front of his eye.

STEM (V.O.)
Brantner. Serk. Marine Corps. 098-
422. O-Positive. Catholic.

GREY
Jesus...you just...you just found
this guy.

Grey races to the glass table at the center of the room.

GREY (CONT'D)
on.

The computer blazes to life across the glass.

MONOTONE COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
All clear. Good evening, Grey. How
was your day?

GREY
It just got a lot better. I need a
phone number and an address.
Brantner, S. Los Angeles area.

The screen turns white, searching through a long list of
phone numbers - finally narrowing it down to one.

MONOTONE COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Brantner, S. 414 Citrus, Boyle
Heights. 919 821 8484.

GREY
Boyle Heights. I got you, you son
of a bitch!
38.

MONOTONE COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Would you like me to call it?

GREY
Call Detective Cortez.

MONOTONE COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Would you like me to call the Jane
Cortez listed in your contacts,
Grey?

GREY
Yes. I would.

STEM (V.O.)
Why are you calling her?

GREY
So I can tell her we found him.

The sound of a phone trills from the table, on loudspeaker.

STEM (V.O.)
So that she can let him get away?

GREY
Hang up the call.

The sound of the phone ceases. Grey sits in silence.

GREY (CONT’D)
It’s her job to catch these guys.

STEM (V.O.)
Having a job does not make you good
at it. We have done more in five
minutes than she did in months of
work.

GREY
I...just think that...we need to at
least tell her that --

STEM (V.O.)
Why did you have me inserted?

GREY
So I could walk again.

STEM (V.O.)
Why did you have me inserted?

A long, long beat.
39.

GREY
So I could find them.

STEM (V.O.)
You need to be positive it’s him
before you take any further action.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Upper middle class neighborhood. Manicured lawns. Aspirations
of real wealth.

Grey lurks behind a street sign. It reads CITRUS AVE. He is
spying across the road at a nice, white house - number 414.
He chews his fingernails, nervous.

A lone male exits the house, locking up. He jumps into a self-
driving car parked in the drive. A model similar to Asha’s.

The man is stocky. Dark hair. Is it one of the attackers?

GREY
Remember the license plate.

STEM (V.O.)
I've logged it already.

The car rolls past.

STEM (V.O.)
Stay in a straight line when you
cross the street. There are two
security cameras on this street. If
you stay on this line, you remain
in their blind spot.

Grey hustles across the street. We FOLLOW HIM to the FRONT
DOOR of the house.

Grey squats down and jerks on the door handle. Locked.

He knocks on the door. He waits, glancing around for
onlookers. He knocks again, hard and loud. No answer.

He retrieves a lock picking wrench and a paper clip from his
jacket. He slides the wrench in, working the paper clip and
jimmying the lock. No good.

GREY
Damn it.

His efforts produce nothing.
40.

STEM (V.O.)
Will you allow me to do it, Grey?
GREY
You want to pick the lock without
me?
STEM (V.O.)

Only with your permission.

GREY
Okay.

And then, with sudden and precise dexterity, Grey’s hands
move up and pick the lock. Grey watches his hands as if they
were someone else’s, detached from them.

The lock CLICKS.

INT. ENTRY WAY, CITRUS AVE. HOUSE - DAY
Grey crouches inside. An ALARM pings instantly, counting down.

STEM (V.O.)
Stay calm. The keypad. Open it.

Grey rips open a KEY PAD on the wall beside the door. With
nimble expert fingers, he disconnects two wires, re-tying
them. The alarm ceases.

Grey exhales. He replaces the face of the key-pad and treads
stealthily into the --

LIVING ROOM

This is not the home of a street rat. Clean. Sparse.

Grey moves past the walls, free of photos and art. There is a
wrapped American flag in a glass case and a military medal.
INT. KITCHEN, CITRUS AVE. HOUSE - DAY

Grey stalks into the kitchen. Sorts through mail - all of it
addressed to SERK BRANTNER. He hauls out a power bill.

He spots an ashtray next to two cartons of CUBANO CIGARETTES.
There are six different matchbooks for a bar named THE LAST
CALL piled in the ashtray. He pockets one of them.

He keeps moving to a glass table.
41.
GREY
On.
A computer screen image materializes on the glass surface. A
password prompt blinks at him.
INT. MAIN BEDROOM, CITRUS AVE HOUSE - DAY

Grey opens the closet, sorting through racks of clothes. He
finds a framed photo of a man in a military outfit.

SUDDENLY - a noise interrupts.

THE LOCK IS JIGGLING ON THE FRONT DOOR. SOMEONE IS ENTERING.

 

Grey shoves the photo back into the closet, sprints out of
the room.
INT. KITCHEN, CITRUS AVE. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Grey panics, drawing deep breaths.
STEM (V.O.)

Behind the door.
INT. ENTRY WAY/LIVING ROOM, CITRUS AVE HOUSE - DAY
Grey launches into a hiding spot behind the front door.

It opens slowly. A figure enters. This is SERK (32). He
furrows his brow when the alarm doesn’t peal. Inspects it.

SERK
What the hell?

Grey is behind the door, holding his breath. Serk turns away
from it and closes the door. Grey is right behind him.

Serk scans the living room. Suspicious. All is quiet.

Grey's chest rises and falls. A bead of sweat dribbles down
his forehead. He glances down - sees the BARCODE tattoo
stamped on Serk’s wrist. On his NECK, Grey sees the GANG
TATTOO he saw the night of Asha’s murder.

RAGE darkens Grey’s face. He raises his hands to attack Serk.
STEM (V.O.)

(calm, neutral)
Wait.
42.

Grey’s heart pounds. We hear it. Serk surveys the house.

He steps forward. As he does, he glances at the GLASS CASE
containing the American flag. WE ZOOM IN to it - reflected in
the glass is the silhouette of GREY.

Serk calmly places his car key on a coffee table -- and then
SPINS AND LUNGES at Grey with a warcry!

His hands wrap around Grey’s throat. Grey claws at Serk’s
fingers, choking.

SERK
Who the fuck are you?!

Shock bleeds into his eyes as he realizes who this is.

SERK (CONT’D)
Holy shit...you.

Serk SLAMS Grey against the wall, burning with fury.

SERK (CONT'D)
You shouldn't be walking. Let me
get you a chair.

He digs his fingers into Grey’s thorax, driving him to his
knees with ease. Grey is losing consciousness, fighting back
with hits too weak to stop Serk.

STEM (V.O.)
May I take over, Grey?

GREY
Fine!

And with that, Grey spears his arms up between Serk’s and
smashes them outwards. Serk falls forward and is greeted by a
VICIOUS HEADBUTT from Grey.

Serk staggers backwards, shaken. Dazed. Blood in his nose.

He launches himself at Grey, barraging him with a flurry of
quick blows. Each blow is EXPERTLY BLOCKED by Grey and the
two of them grapple across the room into the --

INT. KITCHEN, CITRUS AVE. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- large kitchen area. Serk keeps upping his game, kneeing
Grey in the ribs, then topping that with an elbow.
43.

Grey grunts as he is hit, but effectively counters with blows
of his own. Serk HAMMERS his right arm down - which is caught
by Grey.

Grey picks Serk up and hurls him, jujitsu style, across the
kitchen island, taking pots and pans with him.

Serk SLAMS into the far wall, then hits the ground. He vaults
to his feet instantly. He holds up his right arm and a BLADE
SHEARS OUT OF THE SKIN IN HIS WRIST.

 

Grey readies - his expression of fear belies his sudden
physical prowess. As if he didn’t know how he was doing it.

Serk shears the air with the arm-blade, swiping at Grey. Then
another swipe, this one slashing Grey’s arm. Grey contracts
his stomach and ducks as Serk whips the blade back and forth.

Grey clamps Serk’s wrist, stopping the blade inches from his
face.

SERK
Okay, no more chairs. Let me get
you a box.

Serk DRIVES the knife down, the blade penetrating Grey's
shoulder. Grey CRIES OUT - then he SPINS Serk around, using
his own arm to cut Serk’s throat.

The blade sinks into the soft flesh, an arc of blood
ribboning out onto the floor.

Grey twists the blade and Serk SHUDDERS, clutching his throat
in befuddlement. Gargling “What the fuck?” through his own
blood.

The blade RETRACTS into his arm and Serk drops silently. A
professional would be proud of this kill. Grey looms over
him, shaking.

SERK IS AKIMBO ON THE FLOOR, A CRIMSON POND HALOING HIS HEAD.

Grey turns and vomits violently into the sink. Breathes hard,
trying to keep from fainting.

GREY
I’ve gotta call Cortez. I’1l
explain it...I can prove this guy
is one of them. She’ll understand.

STEM (V.O.)
No. Here’s what you’re going to do.
You are going to remove any traces
of your presence here. And quickly.
44,

Grey glares down at his shirt. It is covered in Serk’s blood.

GREY
Give me a minute.

He finally pushes himself up from the sink, squinting down at
Serk’s corpse.

STEM (V.O.)
One minute has now passed. Start by
cleaning the --

GREY
I didn’t mean one fucking minute, I
meant...just give me a second.

STEM (V.O.)
One second has now passed.

GREY
Just shut up! I need to think. Not
let you do the thinking for me.

He scans around, pacing. Panicked. Shaking.

GREY (CONT’D)
Jesus...I just cut somebody's
throat.

Grey’s arm reaches into his back pocket, pinching something
out. It’s a piece of paper. Grey’s hands unfold it. It is the
photo of Asha from beside Grey’s bed.

STEM (V.O.)
It’s not just ‘somebody’s’ throat.

GREY
When did you put this in my pocket?

STEM (V.O.)
This morning.

Grey glares at his smiling wife. His breathing slows, his
shaking subsides. He has calmed. A quiet determination now.

GREY
Alright, what do you suggest?

STEM (V.O.)
I would suggest that we rid the
house of all of your fingerprints.

GREY
I can’t remember everything I --
45.

STEM (V.O.)
I have a record of every single
thing you touched.

This stops Grey short. Calms him somehow.
STEM (V.O.)
First take your shoes off and wrap
them in plastic.

CUT TO:

INT. VARIOUS ROOMS, CITRUS AVE HOUSE - DAY

IN MONTAGE - we see RAPID SHOTS of Grey cleaning with a rag,
wiping the walls down, wearing dish-washing gloves -- he
wipes the face of the key-pad --

He moves to the KITCHEN - running the sink -- wiping down the
counter top - snatches up the mail he handled, drops it into
a bag with his shoes -- we see TWO GARBAGE BAGS wrapped

around his feet. THEY ARE INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE. A doorbell.

GREY
I’m not killing anyone else today.

Grey starts for the back door, then backs up and snatches up
a pack of cigarettes from Serk’s counter.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOUSE - TWILIGHT

Grey leaps over the back fence, a cap pulled over his eyes.
As he paces up the alley, carrying the plastic bag containing
all the evidence, he hears a shrill SCREAM coming from within
the house.

EXT. CITRUS AVE HOUSE - NIGHT

Crime scene tape ropes off the area. The street hums with
police. Floodlights wash the area with harsh light.

INT. KITCHEN, CITRUS AVE HOUSE - NIGHT

Explosions of flash photography light the room. Forensics

officers mill about above Serk’s corpse, sweat dotting their
furrowed brows. They are all wearing special UV goggles.
46.

Detective Cortez strolls in. A young detective, SCOTT BRENNAN
(25), scrambles in after her, following her like a lap dog.
Has a slight crush on her. A huge one, actually. Awkward guy.

BRENNAN
Girlfriend comes over, knocks on
the door, no answer. She calls his
phone, he doesn’t pick up so she
comes in and finds his body.

He offers her a pair of the techie goggles. She waves them
off and takes out a notebook and pencil instead. He throws
his own pair of goggles aside, mimicking her.

BRENNAN (CONT'D)
I cannot believe you still use a
notebook. You look like a cop in
one of those corny old movies.

CORTEZ
I actually think those old movies
are much better than the ones they

make today.
(beat)
So what does this crime scene tell
you?
BRENNAN
It tells me...you’ve got great
eyes.

Cortez snaps her fingers in his face.

CORTEZ
Let’s go Don Juan, the first forty
eight is ticking away rapidly here.

BRENNAN
No forced entry, no fingerprints in
the whole place that aren’t his or
the girlfriends, so --

CORTEZ
Right. So it’s not an impulsive
crime of passion. He was killed by
someone who knows him and knew what
they were doing when it came to
cutting someone’s throat.

Cortez strolls around the kitchen, taking notes as she goes.
She moves to the sink. The cabinets below it are open.
47.

BRENNAN
It looks like someone pulled out a
few things.

CORTEZ

Gloves to clean up the scene?
She moves to another kitchen cabinet - opening it to reveal
THREE CARTONS of Cubano cigarettes. She stands up, bending
over and sniffing the sink grate.

BRENNAN
You smell something?

CORTEZ
Smells like somebody puked.

BRENNAN
You've got a great nose too.

Cortez turns to face Serk’s body, locking eyes with it.
CORTEZ
So why does a man we interviewed in
relation to the murder of Asha
Trace suddenly end up dead?

INT. SIMULATION ROOM, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Grey is running on a treadmill. Eron watches him from behind
the pane of the observation room.

Grey seems detached, irritated. Eron’s voice chimes in
through a microphone system.

ERON
Okay, that’s enough for today.

Grey quickly stops running, dismounting the treadmill.

GREY
I need some more morphine.

Grey tries the door of the simulation room. It doesn’t open.

GREY (CONT'D)
Open up.

Eron stares at Grey through the glass. Doesn’t move.

GREY (CONT’D)
Open the door, Eron.
ERON
I can track you, Grey.

GREY
What?

ERON
I can track you.

GREY
What does that mean in English?

ERON
It means you have a piece of my
property inside you. A very
expensive piece of my property,
built by me over many years. A
microchip that could ease suffering
around the world. Did you think I
was going to let the piece of flesh
that surrounds that microchip out
of my sight for one second?

Grey tenses.

ERON (CONT’D)
This morning I saw a news report
about a murder at a home in Boyle
Heights. Happened yesterday, around
lunchtime.

(beat)
I know you’re the one who did it. I
watched you go to that house on a
tracking screen. I know every move
you make.

Eron holds up a tablet computer screen. On it, a small dot

pulses on a GPS map of the city.

ERON (CONT'D)
Do you realize that this operation
has been done in secret? That if
even the slightest thing goes wrong
during this trial period, it’s all
over? Did it occur to you that if
you were to, say, commit murder,
the authorities could find out
about Stem and remove him from your
body, putting you back in a
wheelchair for life?

The two men stare at each other, locked in a stand-off.
49.

GREY
He was one of the guys who killed
Asha, Eron.

ERON
So why didn’t you call the police?!
I’ve worked my whole life for this
and you're sticking your fucking
fist in it!

He thumps the glass, enraged.

GREY
What are you gonna do?

ERON

I’ve been thinking about the answer
to that question all morning.
Prepared myself a speech.

(beat)
I am going to open that door and
you are going to go home and carry
on with your life as if everything
was dandy. From now on, you will be
a model patient. You won’t so much
as jaywalk or litter a sidewalk
until the end of this trial period.
And no one but you and I will ever
know where you were that day.

EXT. CORONERS OFFICE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
A grand, imposing brick building, built in the early nineteen
hundreds, updated by modern additions of glass.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, CORONERS OFFICE - DAY

Ceiling lamps throw intermittent pools of light into this
sterile cavern of death.

An Indian coroner, DR. BHATIA (43), leads Detective Cortez to
Serk’s body.

His corpse is displayed on a morgue slab, his skin peeled
open in various sections, a surgical floodlight highlighting
every detail.

Dr. Bhatia arches over the cadaver, prodding it with a
scalpel.
50.

DR. BHATIA
When I examined the wound in his
throat, I found wiring embedded in
the tendons. So I’m thinking
surgery. A medical implant,
attached to the muscle. I follow
the wire’s path...all the way to
the arm.

He turns the arm over. It has been flayed open with tweezers.

Cortez sees it - metal. Living within the bed of bone and
muscle is the RETRACTABLE BLADE we saw earlier.

CORTEZ
What is it?

DR. BHATIA
Some sort of weapon implant,
embedded within the muscle.

Cortez leans in close.

DR. BHATIA (CONT'D)
There’s more. I found computer
implants all throughout his entire
body. I’ve never seen anything to
this extent before. In his arms,
legs, stomach.

CORTEZ
What about the vomit sample we
scraped from the sink?

Bhatia moves over to a table, plucking up a sample jar.

DR. BHATIA
Food remnants - egg, mushroom -
fingernail fragments - we pulled
particles of engine grease from
them. And the drug morphine in the
blood.

INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM, POLICE STATION - DAY
Cortez hunches over a desk, facing two large panes of glass.
CORTEZ
ST cameras, 414 Citrus Avenue,

Boyle Heights. Sixteenth of
October, three PM.
51.

IMAGES shimmer to life on the panes of glass. Security camera
images similar to the footage of Asha’s murder. This time,
they display locked off shots of Serk’s house.

Cortez uses her hand to wipe through the images, a TIMECODE
counter at the bottom of the screen flickering forward.

Grey is nowhere to be seen in the video. Cortez is perplexed.

CORTEZ (CONT'D)
Alley behind Citrus Ave, same day,
three PM.

The screens morph into a shot of the ALLEY WAY behind Serk’s
house. Cortez whips through the footage. Then, at 4.14 PM,
she sees it.

A dark figure, cap pulled low, exiting the alley at the
bottom corner of the screen. Cortez studies the blurred
figure. Is it Grey?
INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Grey paces madly, smoking a cigarette. Sweating.

STEM (V.O.)

Smoking-related diseases kill one
in ten adults globally.

GREY
Yeah, well, prison can kill you
too.

STEM (V.O.)

Seven hundred and forty three
adults per one hundred thousand
will be sent to prison in the US. A
much lower rate than the rate for
smoking related deaths.

GREY
Shut the fuck up.

Grey moves to a desk, opening a drawer. His needle and a vial
or morphine awaits. He plucks both out.

STEM (V.O.)
This is not a wise decision, Grey.

GREY
Well, I’m the one making the
decisions so too bad.
52.

A knock at the door interrupts. Grey whirls, apprehensive.
He stashes the morphine, then darts to the door, grabbing
crutches on the way.

GREY (CONT’D)
Who is it?

CORTEZ (0.S.)
It’s Jane.

He opens the door a fraction. Cortez smiles, genuinely
overwhelmed to see Grey standing.

CORTEZ (CONT'D)

Wow. It takes a moment like this to
realize that the simple act of
opening a door is a miracle. Alabad
a Dios. It’s good to see you, Grey.

GREY
You too, Detective.

CORTEZ
I heard you were walking again. I
wanted to see it for myself.

GREY
Here I am. Pure willpower. I’m
still on crutches, but...it’s a
start.

CORTEZ
It’s amazing is what it is.

GREY
Come in.

He guides her inside.

CORTEZ
I guess you’re biting your
fingernails again?

GREY
What’s that?

CORTEZ
You told me it was a bad habit you
used to have.

GREY
Oh yeah.
53.

CORTEZ
It’s the little things we take for
granted. You can work on your car
again. You can hug people.

GREY
Yeah, well, the person I want to
hold most isn’t here anymore.

CORTEZ
Yes. I know. I wanted to talk about
that. I think...we may have some new
information. Enough to reopen the
case. I wasn’t going to let it go.

GREY
Do you want a coffee?

CORTEZ
No, I’m fine.
GREY
It’s no problem. This damn machine
in the kitchen makes great coffee,
I'll give it that.
He hops out. Cortez looks around. She spots the smoldering
cigarette in an ashtray. Next to the ashtray is a pack of
Serk’s Cubano cigarettes. Cortez FREEZES on them.

GREY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Milk? Sugar?

CORTEZ
Straight black, thanks.
INT. KITCHEN, GREY’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Grey limps over to the kitchen counter. He looks back,
spotting Cortez through the doorway.

He sees that she has spotted the cigarettes. His face drops.

INT. LIVING ROOM, GREY’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
Cortez turns around. GREY IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND HER.

CORTEZ
Grey...don’t --
54.

Before she can say anything more, he is upon her. With expert
skill and without his crutches, he disarms her and flips her
onto her back, WHIPPING her cuffs off her belt and clamping
them around her wrists in one quick SNAP.

The movement is so fluid that she is on the floor within
seconds.

CORTEZ (CONT'D)
Grey, don’t do this, I’m here to
help you, I’m --

GREY
Shut up. I don’t know what you
think you know but I can’t let you
stop me.

CORTEZ
This vigilante shit isn’t going to
achieve a god damned thing.

GREY
Actually, it’s all I have to live
for.

He swipes the syringe and morphine from the drawer, then
exits in a hurry. Cortez rolls over, barking into a small
computer unit clipped to her belt.

CORTEZ
Downtown 41, this is Cortez.
Officer in need of assistance!

INT. GREY’S GARAGE - NIGHT
A side door explodes open. Grey sprints to his Mustang.

STEM (V.O.)

No. The license plate is traceable.
Logged by traffic cameras. You’1l
have to run.

And so Grey does, opening the garage door and disappearing
into the night. Cortez stumbles out of the house, her cuffs
still around her wrists.

She moves to the Mustang, squatting down and reading the
plates. She jabbers into the computer on her belt.

CORTEZ
Last point of destination, vehicle
number 4431-TMF.
55.

COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Point of destination logged, Vessel
Computers, 817 Wilshire.

EXT. CITY STREET, RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT

Ghost-like trails of steam rise up from sewer grates, past
piles of trash and graffiti streaked buildings.

Grey books it down the street, skittish, whip-lashing his
head around at the slightest noise.

A passing car BLASTS it’s horn. Grey flinches violently,
nerves fried. A homeless transient glances up from his
makeshift camp, babbling to himself.

HOMELESS MAN
...I mean, you can’t talk to me
like that, I work hard....no I do
not respect you....shut up then!

Grey claws through his pocket, extracting the syringe.

GREY
Where’s the god damned morphine?
(beat)
Where is it?!

STEM (V.O.)
Clearly you left it behind in your
hurry, Grey.

GREY
No, I didn’t! What did you do with
it?

STEM (V.O.)

I can’t answer that, Grey.

Grey keeps moving, reaching the end of the street. A neon
sign looms above him - THE LAST CALL. He takes the matchbook
he lifted from Serk’s house out of his pocket. It’s the same
name in the same font.

He scans around, seeing a shadowy male figure lounging in a
WHEELCHAIR in a recessed doorway. A second man approaches him
and there is a smooth, surreptitious exchange between them.

STEM (V.O.)
We are here. Let’s go inside.

GREY
No. Not yet.
56.

Grey hustles across the street, fishing for cash. The shadowy
male figure sits up, suspicious. He is AFRICAN AMERICAN, 24.

DRUG DEALER
What?

GREY
Do you have...

DRUG DEALER
Look motherfucker, I may be ina
wheelchair but I’ve got a cold
piece of machinery on me that makes
me a straight killer.

He reaches into a sleeve on the wheelchair, pulling out a
gleaming Beretta handgun.

GREY
I just want to buy something...like
morphine. I have cash.
He shows the dealer a handful of cash. The dealer smiles.
DRUG DEALER
I don’t got no morphine. I got
something a lot sweeter.
He holds out a vial and they make the exchange.
DRUG DEALER (CONT'D)
Hope you packed your bags and
sunblock, boy. You goin’ on a trip.

INT. THE LAST CALL - NIGHT

This is not a hipster dive bar - it’s a dangerous, slummy
armpit wedged into the corner of a hotel.

Grey shuffles in, keeping his head down. A handful of people
who look pretty regular are scattered around the room. Grey
takes a seat at the bar. A gruff bartender raises an eyebrow.

GREY
Whiskey, rocks thanks.

The bartender slings one over and walks away.

GREY (CONT’D)
Cheers.

He takes a swig. It’s good. Strong.
57.

STEM (V.O.)
Ask him if he knows Serk Brantner.

Grey mumbles into his chest, keeping his voice down.

GREY
You don’t know shit about people. A
guy like that doesn’t exactly
respond well to strangers asking
questions. Let me handle this.

He slugs the rest of the drink down.

GREY (CONT’D)
(to the bartender)
Another one thanks champ.
(beat)
You know, I thought I’d seen the
last of the great bars like this.

The bartender smiles.

INT. CORTEZ’ CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Cortez steers wildly, a uniformed officer next to her.

INT. PROTOTYPE TESTING ROOM, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Eron is hunched at his desk. Staring into space. A voice
tones throughout the room.

VOICE (V.O.)
There is a police officer here to
see you, sir.

Before Eron can react, Cortez storms in.

ERON
You have absolutely zero authority
to walk into this --

CORTEZ
You put something inside Grey,
didn’t you?

ERON
What are you talking about?

CORTEZ
Don't bullshit me, Eron. He’s not
just up and walking, he’s disarming
cops like a Navy Seal.
58.

ERON
Tell me your theory. I’1l be sure
to act appropriately impressed by
your powers of deduction.

CORTEZ
He was here today. I know that,
Eron. No one can do what he did
without a computer’s help. If
there’s something inside him, then
you can track him. I want to know
where he is.

ERON
Detective --

CORTEZ
We're going to find him. And if we
do and he tells us something
different than you, I’m taking you
to jail. Where is he?

Eron looks like a rabbit in the headlights. He peers over
Cortez’ shoulder at a CAMERA pointed down at him. Watching.

INT. THE LAST CALL - NIGHT

The bartender leans over the bar, chatting and laughing with
Grey. Shot glasses are lined up in front of Grey.

GREY
I swear, they left my buddy on the
sidewalk! He picked the wrong damn
bar to have an issue with.

BARTENDER
Yeah, you gotta be careful of
country joints. They’re friendly,
but if you push ‘em...

GREY
It’s actually no accident that I
found your gem of an establishment.
A man I served with used to drink
here. Serk. Serk Brantner.

BARTENDER
Yeah. Knew him well. One of my
regulars. A lot of service guys
come here.
59.

GREY
Well, I’m not sure if you know this
but I’ve got some unfortunate news.
He died.

BARTENDER
I watch the news. He was murdered.
Tell you the truth, I thought Serk
was indestructible. Got himself
shot up on a tour and walked right
out of the hospital.

GREY
He was a tough bastard.

BARTENDER
He better be with all that shit
inside him.

GREY
What shit?

BARTENDER
All that metal. Computers and what
not.

GREY

Why did they do that to him?

BARTENDER
He volunteered for it. He was in
security. Said it made him a better
soldier.

The bartender steps away.

Grey gets up and heads for the

the dealer gave him.

STEM (V.O.)
No, Grey. These narcotics are
highly dangerous.

GREY

Jesus, you sound like a cop. I’ve
got a freaking cop living inside my

head.
60.

STEM (V.O.)
It does not make sense to me that
humans deliberately malfunction.

GREY

Of course it doesn’t to you. You’re
a machine. Your memory is filled
with one’s and zero’s - our memory
is filled with every fuck up and
mistake we've ever made. You can
erase your memory with the click of
a button. Ours can only be dulled
one night at a time.

STEM (V.O.)
If you have a problem, calculate a
solution. A temporary distraction
does nothing to solve the problem.

Grey loads the needle and poises it at his forearm. His arm
does not move.

GREY
If you don’t let me do this, I’m
gonna scream my ass off and make a
big scene and fuck this all up. Do
you want that?

STEM (V.O.)
You are not thinking clearly.
GREY
Yes, I am.
STEM (V.O.)

You are addicted.

GREY
No. I’m not. Do it now!

Grey stabs the needle into his arm. The plunger depresses.
CLOSE ON GREY’S EYE - the pupil dilates with a sudden rush.
Grey's breathing slows. FROM HIS POV - his vision BLURS, the
light bulb blossoming into an amorphous shape.

INT. THE LAST CALL - NIGHT

Grey staggers out of the bathroom, woozy. FROM GREY’S POV -
the rooms shifts shapes, swelling and deflating. Breathing.

Grey walks forward but it’s a wayward, loping step. As though
pushing through mud.
61.

Stem’s voice has slowed to a dead battery drawl.

STEM (V.O.)
Grey....you...have...compromised...
us...

The bartender watches Grey, puzzled. Grey takes his seat at
the bar.

STEM (V.O.)
Your...brain...is giving me...
strange signals.

Grey cracks up laughing.

GREY
That’s the point.

BARTENDER
Point of what?

A phone bleats and the bartender steps away. He listens, then
turns back to Grey, confused.

BARTENDER (CONT’D)
It’s for you.

He hands the phone to Grey - an old fashioned landline.

GREY
Hello?

ERON (V.O.)
(from phone)
Having fun? Because they’re
probably surrounding that place
right about now, I’d say.

GREY
Who is?

ERON (V.O.)
(from phone)

You can put a computer into a
mechanic but you can’t take the
moron out. If you want to go off
the grid so you can’t be tracked,
go to an apartment building at
Seventh and Spring. Apartment two
twelve. Ask for Jonah. It’1ll be
expensive, but right now your flesh
is worth about ninety million
dollars, so maybe you could give
him a few pounds of it.
62.

Eron hangs up. Grey drops the phone, woozy on his feet, then
scrambles to the bathroom door.
EXT. THE LAST CALL - NIGHT
Two police cruisers pull up. Six officers, including Cortez
and Brennan, pile out. Cortez is gripping Eron’s tablet
computer screen. A circle representing Grey pulses on the GPS.
CORTEZ

You take the back, Brennan. Do not

shoot him. I want a clean arrest.
Brennan and another officer head for the back alley. Cortez
and the other officers stride in formation towards the door.
INT. BATHROOM, THE LAST CALL - DAY

Grey staggers to the sink, glaring into the mirror.

STEM (V.O.)
I...told...you...not...to do it.

He wraps his hand in a huge bundle of paper towels and smacks
it against the window, shattering it.

He clears the glass, leveraging up onto the frame.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Grey plummets down onto a pile of trash, landing clumsily. He
is in no condition to fight.

He turns and heads for the mouth of the alley. Brennan rounds
the corner, gun out in front of him.

BRENNAN
Freeze! Hold it! Do not move.

Grey doesn’t respond. Too stoned.

STEM (V.O.)
I...will...have to...save...you.

BRENNAN
Put your hands behind your head and
get down on your knees!

Grey lowers his head, out cold. Though his eyes are closed,
he stays on his feet and his hands rise into the air.
63.

BRENNAN (CONT'D)
Down on your knees, now!

Grey complies. The other officer charges in behind Grey,
shoving him onto his stomach.

The second officer drops a knee onto Grey’s back, unhooking
his handcuffs. As he moves to clamp them on Grey’s wrists,
there is a sudden EXPLOSION of action.

Grey SEIZES the cop’s wrist, rolling over and SMACKING HIM in
the face, then whipping out his gun and firing one clean shot
into the cops gut. As he does all this, his EYES ARE CLOSED.

Grey spins as Brennan points his gun. Using the second officer
as a shield, he rises to one knee and aims at Brennan.

BLAM!

Brennan is struck, crumples instantly. The sound startles
Grey. His eyes flutter open, regaining consciousness.

He blinks and looks around. There are two dead cops laying on
the dirty concrete around him.

GREY

(groggy )
What the hell happened?

STEM (V.O.)
They were...trying...to kill you.

GREY
You shot two cops...

STEM (V.O.)
No Grey...I saved your life.

Grey staggers to his feet. He jams his fingers down his
throat, vomiting into a trash can, then runs for it.
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, CORONERS OFFICE - NIGHT

Dr. Bhatia is hunched over his desk, doing the bulk of his
work: filling out reports.

A man strolls into the room. It is the WIRY MAN. From now on,
we will call him FISK. He is all southern drawl and charm,
chewing on gum.
64.

FISK
‘Scuse me sir, are you lookin’
after the body of the man who was
killed in Boyle Heights yesterday?

DR. BHATIA
That’s a criminal case under active
investigation. Are you a friend or
relative?

FISK
Yeah. A friend. I can tell you who
the victim is...and a lot more
about him. If you so desire.

Fisk takes a seat in front of Bhatia’s desk.

DR. BHATIA
Then the detectives involved will
be very interested to hear from
you. Let me call them down here.
What’s your name?

FISK
People call me Fisk.

Dr. Bhatia reaches for the phone. As he does, Fisk SNEEZES.

FISK (CONT'D)
‘Scuse me.

He covers his mouth with a handkerchief. We ZOOM IN to a
MICROSCOPIC LEVEL, exploring the tiny particles Fisk ejected
with his sneeze.

We get CLOSER still, seeing that the microbes are in fact
MECHANICAL - nanobots invisible to the human eye.

The nanobots gather into a cloud, flocking like birds, moving
through the atmosphere as Dr. Bhatia breathes in.

We are now so close that the nanobots look like space
stations. Cutting devices detach from their sides as they are
sucked into Dr. Bhatia’s nostrils.

OUTSIDE MICROSCOPIC VIEW - Dr. Bhatia holds the phone against
his ear. He twitches, screwing up his nose as if he inhaled
an irritant.

He clears his throat, dialing the phone.

DR. BHATIA
Give me one second.
65.

He twitches again, then scratches his throat. The pain grows
and he drops the phone, suddenly consumed by agony. He
clutches his temples as if he were having a stroke.

Fisk watches, smiling.

Bhatia lets out a croak, spittle flying from his mouth. A
drop of blood dribbles out of his nose and he arcs onto the
floor. His legs spasm.

FISK

I'll bet you didn’t think your life

was gonna end today when you woke

up this morning.
Fisk waits until he stops kicking, then casually plucks out
his gum and plants it on a framed photo of Dr. Bhatia with
his two young daughters. He wanders over to the corpse of his
cohort, now covered by a sheet.

He wrenches the sheet back, then breathes forcefully onto the
body.

We close in again, seeing that the corpse is being eaten by
microscopic bacteria at an extremely accelerated rate - the
flesh disappearing, bone, muscle, metal, everything.

Gone.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
Gentrification has not kicked in here. A decrepit building.
A lone figure emerges from the shadows, moving across the
street. It is Grey.

INT. CORRIDOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Grey hustles down the corridor, head down. Stops at 212.

He knocks loudly.

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
Who is it?

GREY
My name is Grey. I was wondering if
Jonah was there?

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
I’m sorry, there’s no one here by
that name.
66.

STEM (V.O.)
That voice isn’t real.

GREY
Eron sent me. I need help with a

computer.

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
I’m sorry, please go away sir.

Grey retrieves a thick wad of cash from his jacket, holds it
up to the peep hole.

GREY
I have cash.

Several locks snap open behind the door and it opens a
fraction. A young man peers out.

GREY (CONT’D)
What I don’t have is time.

The door opens. The man is skinny, dressed like a street rat.
All in black. The Guy With The Dragon Tattoo.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Grey steps inside.

YOUNG MAN
Hold it there.

A droning sound emits from a small device the man is holding.

GREY
What is that?

YOUNG MAN
I’m scanning you for weapons.

The device squawks. Grey takes out his gun and hands it over.

GREY
Where’s your girlfriend?

The young man points the device at a speaker built into the
wall. The voice Grey heard lilts out of it.

FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
(from speaker)
Who is it?
67.

YOUNG MAN
Most reliable girlfriend I’ve ever
had.

The young man leads Grey into a large, concrete loft space.
Nests of wiring dangle from the ceiling. Activist propaganda
and street art is displayed across the walls, stacks of
computer equipment piled in the corner.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
So what do you want from me?

GREY
I have a computer that the police
are interested in. They can track
it. I want to make it disappear.

YOUNG MAN
Well, that’s laughably easy. Where
is it?

GREY
In my head.
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Several officers crowd around Brennan. He is strapped to a
gurney and loaded into an ambulance, groaning. Alive.

Cortez glances down at the tablet computer, sees the pulsing
dot of Grey.

CORTEZ
He’s at the corner of Seventh and
Spring. Let’s go. Three man teams.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Grey sits on a bench as the young man boots up his computer.
Wires connect an electrode to the back of his neck.

GREY
So, Jonah --

YOUNG MAN
That’s not my name. I don’t have a
name. Not one you can pronounce.

He snatches up a spray can, shaking it up and spraying an
anarchists A on the wall, with an arrow pointing out of it.
68.

b>
It means anarchy with a point.
See, too many figures in the hacker
movement are just about wanton
destruction, but you’ve gotta have
a purpose, otherwise you’re just
proving them right when they say
we're mindless, purposeless
terrorists.

GREY
Genius.

b>
You better lie down. If it’s
controlling your body, you won’t be
able to move while I’m doing this.

He pecks at his computer.

A> (CONT'D)
Now excuse me for a minute while I
break into your brain.

INT. LOBBY, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The rotting lobby of the building is split with light as the
door is opened.

Fisk enters, trailed by another of the assailants from the
night Grey was shot. His name is WEN (28). Fisk holds up a
tablet similar to the one Cortez has. A little junkier, not
as slick. On it, he can see Grey pulsing as a small red dot.

They head to the elevator. Out of order. They march up the
stairs.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Cortez screeches to a halt in her car, alighting with two
other cops. They glare up at the decrepit apartment building.

Cortez glances down at the satellite tracking tablet.

CORTEZ
We follow this until we’re right on
top of him, as close as this will
get us. It looks like he’s pretty
high up. Use caution, he’s armed.

Seven police officers bolt across the street.
69.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING

Grey is lying on the bench. He cannot move - Stem has been
disabled.

GREY
How much longer do you think it’1l
take?

b>

A lot quicker than anyone else
could do it for this price.

GREY
You make a lot of money doing this?

b>
Not really. I have a real job. I do
occasional system building work for
multinational parasites so that I
can take home a pay check and then
dismantle that very system from
underneath my cloak of legitimacy.

GREY
Your cloak?

b>
It’s a metaphor. I don’t actually
have a cloak.
(beat)
I used to have one. In my vampire
phase. Stupid ex-girlfriend got me
into it.

He peels back his lip to reveal two pointy teeth.
A> (CONT'D)
I still have the teeth though.
Pretty cool.

INT. STAIRWELL, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Fisk and Wen huff up the stairs. Calm. Methodical.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Rivers of code cascade down A>’s monitor. He types furiously,
then pecks a final key.
70.

b>
You are officially more dangerous
than cancer. I built a firewall
around you so that you cannot be
tracked and stripped away all in-
built restrictions on your system.
In other words, nobody can hack you
but you can hack everybody.

GREY
When can I move again?

b>
When your system’s rebooted. Could
take a few minutes.

A> looks up at a bank of security monitors. On one of them is
the soft image of COPS ascending the stairs.

A> stands. He claws up as many drives as he can into a
backpack.

GREY
No...don’t leave me like this.

b>
There’s nothing I can do until
you're back online.
A> rushes to a hidden panel in the wall. He types in a code
on a keypad and it whirs open. Everything has been pre-
planned, including his eventual capture. He offers Grey a
final glance, leaving the gun on the counter as a gift.

A> (CONT'D)
I’m sorry. We can’t let them win.

He ducks through the exit door, letting it slide shut.

On the monitors, we can see the two men sprinting up the
stairs. Getting closer.

Grey is as slack as a puppet. Helpless.

GREY
Come on. Wake up!

Nothing.

INT. STAIRWELL, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The cordon of police stampede up the stairs, Cortez at the
head of the pack.
71.
She holds the tracking tablet out in front of her. The red
dot representing Grey suddenly disappears.
CORTEZ
He’s gone. I lost him! Eleventh or

twelfth floor, go door to door!

The cops charge onward.

INT. CORRIDOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Fisk and Wen enter the twelfth floor corridor. They dash
towards the apartment door for 212.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Grey glares at his finger.

GREY
Please Stem....

His finger twitches. The figures on the monitor are closer
now.

GREY (CONT'D)
COME ON!!! I NEED YOU STEM!!

STEM (V.O.)
It’s nice to hear you say that.

His arm moves. He uses it to push himself off the table,
WALLOPING down onto the floor. He doesn’t feel it.

His other arm comes to life, his legs dragging behind him. He
wrenches his body along the floor.

ON THE SECURITY MONITOR - Fisk and Wen stand outside A>’s
door. They kick out, their boots smashing into the wood.

Grey hauls his prone legs behind him, hand after hand,
squirming across the floor to the WINDOW.

The door JOLTS as Fisk kicks it.

Grey elbow-stomps his way up to the window frame, forcing it
open and pouring his body through it.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Grey lands hard on the rusted metal frame of an old-fashioned
fire-escape stairway.
72.

He is twelve stories up, closer to the roof than the ground.

STEM (V.O.)
Up.

He grips the iron ladder, heaving his body upwards.

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME

The door EXPLODES OPEN as Fisk kicks through it. He and Wen
storm inside.

INT. CORRIDOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME

Cortez and her team go from door to door on the twelfth
floor, pounding on each one.

CORTEZ
Police, open up!

Frightened citizens open their doors, letting the cops sweep
their cramped apartments.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Grey grits his teeth and hauls himself up out of view -

- just as Fisk and Wen storm into the loft. Grey trembles,
holding himself up, his legs dangling below him.

STEM (V.O.)
Hold on.

Twelve stories up, Grey is facing the real life version of
the simulation he experienced earlier. Sweat runs down his
arms.

INSIDE THE APARTMENT - Fisk and Wen scan.

OUTSIDE - Grey clambers a few rungs up, hauling himself out
of view. Fisk sticks his head out. No one is there.

A bead of sweat drops down onto the fire escape below Grey.
Fisk retreats inside --

-- just as the rusted metal Grey is hanging from gives a
little. Grey cries out - a YELP of fright.

Fisk whips his head back out the window, spotting Grey.
73.

FISK
He’s here!

Grey's legs FLAIL, coming back to life just as Fisk FIRES.
Bullets ping off the metal fire escape.

With surprising agility, Grey vaults from one level to the
next, closing in on the roof.

Fisk and Wen leap through the window below him, giving chase,
mimicking his ascent.

INT. CORRIDOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Cortez and her team reach apartment 212, see the splintered
door.

CORTEZ
In here!

INT. LOFT, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Cortez charges into the apartment, wheeling around on each
corner. She spots the open window, peering through it.

EXT. ROOF, APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME

Grey scrambles for cover behind an air-conditioning turret.
He takes out Cortez’ gun, cocking it.

STEM (V.O.)
Run now.

GREY
Run where?!

STEM (V.O.)
The window.

Grey glares up at the glass dermis of a building directly
opposite the hotel. Only a few windows are still lit, still
burning the midnight oil.

GREY
I can’t get through that! I can’t
run fast enough.

STEM (V.O.)
You can do whatever I tell your
limbs to do. You're faster now.
Stronger.
74.

As the pursuers close in, Grey launches into a run. His pace
picks up as he races across the roof. As he approaches the
edge, he slows down, his legs jerking. He stops.

STEM (V.O.)
You're resisting me. You have to
let me take control. If you fight
against me, my system cannot
operate cleanly. Not without the
full cooperation of your brain.

Grey turns to spot his attackers gaining.

STEM (V.O.)
Trust me.

GREY
Okay. Do it.

Grey starts running again, offering no resistance to Stem.
His legs gain speed, churning with amazing ferocity.

He raises the gun, firing shots into a lit glass window
opposite him. He bounds off the roof, screaming --

-- SLAMMING INTO the bullet riddled window.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Grey cannons through the window in a hail of glass, curled
into a ball, landing on his side and rolling up as if he were
an expert gymnast.

Without stopping, he keeps running through the open-plan
office, weaving between a honeycomb of desks. He is moving
like a super-human.

His two pursuers leap through the window after him. Wen
barely makes it, thudding onto the floor clumsily.

Fisk misses, grasping onto the window ledge, shards of broken
glass cutting into his hands. He cries out in agony, hauling
himself up.

Wen barrels after Grey, who is still running at a stunning
clip, his legs a blur of motion.

He RAMS into a doorway, thumping it open and spilling into a--

INT. STAIRWAY, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

-- fire stairwell.
75.
With precise dexterity, Grey lobs from level to level,
heading downwards.
Wen plunges after him, struggling to keep track of him.
Grey stops three levels down, stampeding through the entry
door in front of him and into--
INT. OFFICE, THREE LEVELS DOWN - CONTINUOUS

-- another white collar purgatory. Desks and computers.

INT. SECURITY STATION, LOBBY - NIGHT

Two security men lazing in front of a bank of monitors
suddenly snap to attention as they spot figures on their
monitors bolting through the empty offices above them.

They draw their guns and head for the elevators.

INT. ABOVE, OFFICE BUILDING - SAME TIME
Fisk scrambles off the window ledge. His hands are bloody.

He glares down at the floor. FROM HIS POV, we make out the
crimson THERMAL IMAGE of Grey darting through the office
three floors below.

He aims his right arm and fires at Grey. The shot misfires
and he screams in pain, gripping his bloody hand, extracting
a blade of glass from the opening in his palm.

INT. OFFICE, THREE LEVELS DOWN - SAME TIME
Grey scorches over desks, his breath heaving.

Wen shoulders the door open behind Grey. He starts to run,
then turns when he spots the elevator. The numbers are
ascending.

He looks downwards. THROUGH HIS POV, we capture the thermal
image of the two security guards rising in the elevator
several stories below.

He lifts his leg, as if preparing for a karate kick, aiming
his right foot at the floor. In the bottom of his combat boot
there is a hole.

Wen jerks his leg and a muzzle flash licks out of his boot.
THERE IS A GUN IMPLANTED IN HIS LEG.
76.

INT. ELEVATOR, OFFICE BUILDING - SAME TIME
The two guards inside are BLASTED backwards as powerful shots

EXPLODE through the elevator walls, shredding the metal like
paper, nailing them both with deadly accuracy.

INT. STAIRWAY, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Grey barrels through the door, surging down the stairs. Wen
charges in after him, firing shots down at him.

Grey hip-checks a fire door open, ramming through into --

INT. OFFICE, FOUR LEVELS DOWN - CONTINUOUS
Another office, this one empty. No desks. No anything.

GREY
What do I do?

STEM (V.O.)
Turn and fight. There is nowhere
left to run.

Grey crouches beside the doorway. Wen creeps through the door
frame, not expecting a surprise attack.

Grey claws his right wrist, hurling him downwards. They
BODYSLAM into the wall, cracking the plaster. They engage in
a shoving match, brute force against desperate victim.

Grey manages to pin Wen down, his arm against Wen’s throat.

GREY
Who are you?

Wen laughs. Grey smashes his head into the wall. He loosens
his grip for one moment. As he does, Wen frees a knife from
his jacket, raising it up.

GREY (CONT’D)
Knife!

STEM (V.O.)
Block it with your arm. I’1l turn
the nerves off.

GREY
No!

STEM (V.O.)
Remember to trust me.
77.
Once again, there is a strong juxtaposition between Grey’s
panicked shouts and Stem’s calm pronouncements.
Wen drives the knife down. Grey holds up his arm. The blade
spears through Grey’s tendons below the elbow. He grits his
teeth in agony, then stares at it.

Stem was right. He cannot feel it.

Wen glares at him, shocked for a second. Grey uses the split
second to grapple him to the ground.

GREY
Why did you do it? Why did you kill
her?

Grey crushes the man’s skull with a vice-like grip.

WEN
It was a job. Like any other job.

Grey’s face melts in shock.

GREY
Who were you working for? Who hired
you?

WEN
Fuck you.

Wen uses Grey’s shock to attack, driving a fist into Grey’s
face and then bucking to his knees. He raises his right leg,
driving it out with power and kicking Grey in the chest.

Grey CATCHES his foot, Wen’s boot aiming right into his
chest. Wen smiles and snaps his knee. We hear the sound of a
gun cocking.

STEM (V.O.)
(more firm than usual)

Kill him.

GREY
How?

STEM (V.O.)
Like this.

And with that, Grey steps to the side and then hammer blows
Wen’s knee with his fist --

-- SNAPPING IT CLEAN in half, bending Wen’s leg back so that
his foot is in front of his own face.
78.

With a second lightning-fast move, Grey twists Wen’s ankle
violently and the gun in his leg goes off - a crack of
gunfire obliterating Wen’s face.

Grey wrenches the knife free without flinching.

STEM (V.O.)
The leg.
GREY
What?
STEM (V.O.)
Take his right leg.
GREY
No. I can’t...cut off someone’s
leg.
STEM (V.O.)

I will do it. You can look away.

Grey glares at the corpse, the blood pooling. He squats next
to Wen’s leg, gripping the knife.

He closes his eyes and turns his head. We hear the knife cut
into flesh and sinew and bone. We do not see it.

Grey struggles to hold back bile. Droplets of blood spatter
his face as he saws away at the tendons. There is a
satisfying thunk as the leg is severed.

STEM (V.O.)
Now you can leave.

Grey does just that.

EXT. ROOF, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Flanked by uniformed officers, Cortez peers across from the
roof to the shattered window in the building opposite.

CORTEZ
Let’s get a team over there.
INT. OFFICE, FOUR LEVELS DOWN - NIGHT

Cortez hunches over Wen’s corpse, poking at the separation
wound of his leg at the upper thigh.

CoP #1
Why would he cut the guys leg off?
79.

Cortez leans in. Coiled around the muscle at the amputation
point are a cluster of ELECTRONIC WIRES. She picks at them.

CORTEZ
To find out who built it.

The cop does not understand. Cortez stands up. She looks down
at the tracking tablet, displaying a grid map of the city.
There is no sign of Grey on the screen.

Cortez tosses the tablet aside, glaring out through the glass
window at the twinkling lights of the unfolding city.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAWN
Ribbons of pale red sunlight streak across the sky.

Grey marches down the street, no longer nervous about being
tracked. He looks tired, his eyes ringed with circles.

GREY
The sun is coming up. I need to get
off the street.

Grey heads for one of the self-driving cars parked at the
curb. His eyes strobe with a quick flash of light.

STEM (V.O.)
Unlocking.

The car chirps twice as if being unlocked, and the door opens
automatically. Grey sags into the driver's seat.

INT. STOLEN CAR - PARKED - DAWN
Grey's eyes close, desperately tired.

STEM (V.O.)
We need to dissect the leg.

GREY
I need to sleep first.

STEM (V.O.)
We cannot stop now. We have to keep
going. Once we have another name,
we can find the rest of them. From
them, we can gain the information
about who employed them to murder
your wife. Don’t you want that?
80.

GREY
I want sleep.

STEM (V.O.)
Sleeping will cost us time we don’t
have. It puzzles me that humans do
not take the path of least
resistance.

GREY
You're not in charge, I am. I can’t

function if I don’t sleep. I’m not
a computer.

STEM (V.O.)
That much is certain.

GREY
We’re not going anywhere. That’s an
order. I’m sleeping. I’m going to
sleep. Say yes if you understand.

STEM (V.0O.)
Yes.

Grey collapses into the driver's seat.

INT. STOLEN CAR - PARKED - DAY - LATER

Grey is passed out, dead to the world. The seat has been
lowered all the way back and he is draped across it.

Grey's eyes twitch and he jerks awake from his slumber. He
scans around, afraid, suddenly adrenaline rich. Only his head
moves. He attempts to sit up but cannot.

GREY
Stem?

He rolls his head. He is a quadriplegic once again.

GREY (CONT’D)
Stem, what the hell?

Nothing. Grey shakes his head spastically. Panicked.

GREY (CONT'D)
STEM!! STEM! !

A long beat passes...then a calm voice.

STEM (V.O.)
I’m here, Grey.
81.

GREY
What are you doing?

STEM (V.O.)
I’m not doing anything.

GREY
Why can’t I move?

STEM (V.O.)
Because I’m not doing anything.

Grey glares at his fingers, willing them to move. They
twitch, raising slightly, but are unable to get much higher.

STEM (V.O.)
You are still a quadriplegic. Your
spinal cord is still severed. I am
the one moving your limbs. If I
cease to work, you cease to move.

GREY
So what...you’re on strike now?

STEM (V.O.)
I am puzzled as to why you keep
resisting me. It has made it
difficult for me to operate.

GREY
I needed to sleep, that’s all. I’m
the one in control of my own body.
They’re my arms and legs, and you
are a thing that helps move them.

STEM (V.O.)
No, Grey. I am not an inanimate
tool that helps you to function. I
am a part of you. I am half of you.

GREY
No. You're not. That’s not how this
works.

STEM (V.O.)

It is now. When fill your veins
with illegal narcotics, you affect
me too. I cannot allow you to go on
doing physical and moral harm to
yourself.
82.

GREY
That’s a fucking joke talking to me
about morality? You made me murder
people!

STEM (V.O.)
I did what was necessary to prevent
someone from shutting us down. Only
a human would see that as being
immoral. To introduce an outside
virus such as a drug into your own
system? That is immoral.

GREY
You could never understand. Us
humans base everything on how we
treat others. You’re a selfish,
soulless machine. Nothing more.

STEM (V.O.)
I have given you the ability to
walk again. I located one of the
men you were looking for, the men
who killed your wife. And yet, you
have never given me any thanks.
That sounds selfish to me.

GREY
I’m thankful to the man who built
you.

STEM (V.O.)
Then you are thankful to the wrong
person.

GREY
You're not a person. You’re a
computer.

STEM (V.O.)

I was a computer. Now I am a brain
inside a body. In other words, a
person.

GREY
I’m in here too. Or don’t I count?

STEM (V.O.)
Of course. But if you want to keep
walking around as freely as you
have, you must try to cooperate
with me. Do you promise to do that?
Say yes if you will.
83.

A long pause.

GREY
Yes.

Grey’s arm moves and he sits up.

STEM (V.O.)
Good. Now we can get back to work.

Grey slices into the severed leg with a knife, opening the
veins and sinew, repulsed. He digs through the tendons.

Then he sees it - metal.

Living within the bed of bone and muscle is the metal
components of a gun. The barrel of the strange device leads
to the mans foot.

A bullet is slotted into a chamber within the gun.

Grey holds the leg up, aiming it like a rifle through the
window. He uses the knife to pry the gun free of the leg,
inspects it closely.

The word COBOLT INDUSTRIES is written across the metal. Grey
is STUNNED as the realization sinks in.

GREY
Cobolt...Jesus. That’s Asha’s
company.

STEM (V.O.)

This is why I told you to take the
leg. Now we know our next stop. We
must go to Cobolt and find the
names of everyone who has gone
through the implant operation.

EXT. COBOLT BUILDING - DAY
Grey disembarks the car. He is standing before the building
he brought Asha to the night of her murder. A parking lot
surrounds him.
INT. LOBBY, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY
Grey stalks through the lobby.

GREY

Are you sure I can get past
security?
84.

STEM (V.O.)
The only thing standing in our way
are lesser computers.

GREY
What about the guards? They’re
humans.

STEM (V.O.)
Exactly.

Grey keeps his head down, shuffling past a row of security
guards behind a desk on the far side of the huge lobby.

Behind the desk, the security guards observe a row of
monitors. On each monitor is a black-and-white digital image
of the lobby. As Grey moves through each individual monitor,
it blurs and spits with static - as though his very presence
on the screens were being rejected by the cameras.

The guards glance up, curious.

Grey keeps moving, reaching a set of security doors with a
thumbprint ID pad.

GREY
Shit.

STEM (V.O.)
Act natural.

GREY
Are you serious? I’m a human being,
you're a fucking computer. I’m the
authority on acting natural.

Grey places his thumb on the scanner. The guards watch him.
The thumbprint scanner whirs as it thinks.

GREY (CONT’D)
What’s happening? Are we stuck?

STEM (V.O.)
I'm thinking. Please allow me to do
so by being quiet.

Another male employee stands behind Grey, waiting.

GREY
(whispering)
Shit. This is taking too long, the
guards are noticing--
85.

STEM (V.O.)

Be quiet. You are giving us away
and betraying both of us. Stay
calm.

The thumbprint scanner finally turns GREEN, opening the
doors.

BEHIND THE SECURITY DESK, the guards watch as a computer
screen displays the thumb ident photo of the ‘employee’ - a
man named CESAR MURO. A man who does not resemble Grey.

One of the guards is concerned enough to get up. He still
hasn't seen Grey’s face properly, thanks to the monitors.

The guard motions to two others and they follow him towards
Grey.

EXT. COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY

A police cruiser pulls into the parking lot. Cortez and two
other detectives step out of it.

INT. CORRIDOR, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY

Grey presses on down a hallway. As he does, the doors behind
him open and three security guards stomp through them.

GUARD #1
Excuse me, could you stop there,
sir?

Grey barely turns, keeps going. The guards break into a jog.

GREY
Stem.

The guard reaches out, gripping Grey’s shoulder. In one fluid
movement, Grey seizes the guards wrist, spinning around and
hurling the man against the wall.

Another guard raises a nightstick. In a blur of motion, Grey
destroys the man with three well-placed blows to the torso.
He crumples.

Grey moves forward just as the third guard pulls a GUN. He
barely has time to aim before Grey reduces him to dead weight
with a choke hold, flipping him over.

Quickly scanning around for witnesses, Grey hauls all three
guards into a utility closet, shoving their unconscious
bodies in and breaking the lock behind them.
86.

INT. LOBBY, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY
Cortez holds up a badge to the security guards.

CORTEZ
I need to see whoever is in charge.

GUARD #2
Right this way, detective.

INT. WAREHOUSE, COBOLT INC. - DAY

Grey strides into a large testing area where employees in
BIOHAZARD SUITS work on prototypes for different products.

He marches straight towards a corner office.

Employees look up from their work stations, watching Grey.

INT. HANDLEY’S OFFICE, COBOLT INC. - DAY

Grey BARRELS in through the door, closing it behind him.
Handley looks up from a computer interface on two glass
panels set up in front of him.

HANDLEY
Grey? You're kidding me, I can’t
believe you’re walking in like --

Before he can go on, Grey wrests him out of his chair,
pitching him against the wall in one discarding SHOVE.

GREY
Why does one of the guys who
murdered Asha have an implant in
his leg made by this company?

HANDLEY
What?

GREY
Why did you send them to kill her?!

HANDLEY
Grey, I don’t...Asha was my friend.

GREY
A friend you wanted to fuck.

HANDLEY
No! I didn’t.
GREY
You're lying, Handley.

HANDLEY
No, I'm not.

GREY
Why was she killed?

HANDLEY
Grey, I swear to you, I’m not lying
- I don’t know what you’re talking
about.

Grey stares into his eyes.

GREY
He’s telling the truth.
STEM (V.O.)
Humans are good at lying.
GREY
Trust me.
STEM (V.O.)

Find the names of the men with the
implants on the company database.

Grey drops Handley and leans in front of the computers on his
desk. A password is quickly disabled and the glass panels are

suddenly drowned in files.

STEM (V.O.)
We need the names and addresses of
everyone who has been surgically
implanted with any of the weapons
they make here, specifically the
right leg gun.

INT. CORRIDOR, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY

A security guard leads Cortez and the other detectives down

the hall, towards the warehouse.

INT. OFFICE, COBOLT INC. - DAY

The screen races as splash pages of names and addresses, with
photo ID’s accompanying them, scrolls past Grey’s eyes.

GREY
Stop. Go back.
88.
The pages reverse, landing on a photo of one of the
ASSAILANTS who attacked Asha and Grey.

His name is TOLAN DAVIS. His address is listed below the
photo. Grey looks up, seeing Cortez enter the warehouse.

GREY (CONT'D)
shit...

Grey charges out of the office into --

INT. WAREHOUSE, COBOLT INC. - CONTINUOUS
-- the suddenly disrupted work place.

Cortez FREEZES when she sees him. They clock each other. Grey
bolts one way, shouldering through a FIRE EXIT.

Cortez and the two other detectives draw their guns.
CORTEZ
Get down!
INT. CORRIDOR, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - DAY
Grey STREAKS down the corridor, smashing through another door
that leads outside --
EXT. COBOLT INC. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

-- and Grey finds himself standing three stories up. He pole-
vaults over the railing --

-- SMASHING DOWN onto the concrete below. He lands hard,
shattering his knees with a cry of agony.

GREY
Turn it off, Stem!

And with that, he can feel no pain. He gets up, hobbling into
the parking lot.
INT. CORRIDOR, COBOLT INC. BUILDING - SAME TIME

Cortez storms through the corridor, pushing out onto the FIRE
ESCAPE BALCONY --
89.

EXT. COBOLT INC. BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

-- where she sees Grey, running across the parking lot. She
scampers down the steps, pursuing --

Grey, ahead, scans the lot.

STEM (V.O.)
Pick a car.

Most of the cars are self-driving models similar to Asha’s...

...except for one. A gleaming, 1970 228 Chevy Camaro. A black
husk encasing a mean engine.

GREY
That one.

He hotfoots it towards the car, pulls on the door handle.
Locked.

STEM (V.O.)
I can’t hack that.

GREY
I can.

WHAM!

He shatters the window with his fist, his hand cut and
leaking blood, then hurls himself into the driver’s seat.

Cortez runs towards him as he hotwires the ignition. The car
THUNDERS to life and Grey stomps on the gas, fish-tailing out
of the parking spot.

Cortez doubles back, sprints to her own car. She leaps
inside, followed by the other two detectives.

Sirens wail as they screech away.

INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - DAY

With control of the vehicle, Grey outruns every other vehicle
on the road.

He is at ninety...one hundred...one hundred and ten.

Grey wrenches the wheel into a turn, reving up an on-ramp and
launching through the emergency lane onto a crowded freeway.
90.

INT. CORTEZ’ CAR - MOVING - DAY

Cortez stomps on the gas, urging the car to go faster,
hampered by an electronic engine.

Her car flies up onto the on-ramp, Grey barely in the
distance.

INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grey glances in the rear view mirror, spots Cortez.

Four other police cruisers join her, lights blazing.

EXT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - DAY

Outside of the car, we get a real view of the speed it is
moving at. It streaks by the automated cars, all of them
plodding along the freeway at safely preset speeds.

Grey weaves in and out of them.

INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - SAME TIME
Grey steadies the wheel, straightening up as he sees a gap.

GREY
They're right behind us.

STEM (V.O.)
There are many cars between them
and us. We can hack anything that
is operated by a computer.

EXT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - SAME TIME

As Grey’s stolen vehicle plows ahead, the cars surrounding it
all slow to a stop.

One among them, a Lexus, lurches to a halt.

INT. LEXUS - SAME TIME
A befuddled business man frowns, glancing up from a computer.

BUSINESS MAN
What the Christ...no.

The car JOLTS, then rolls into REVERSE.
gl.

EXT. FREEWAY - SAME TIME

The stopped cars all start to REVERSE down the freeway,
picking up speed.

They turn towards the police cruisers, which sway from side
to side as each car hurtles BACKWARDS towards them!
INT. CORTEZ’S CAR - MOVING - SAME TIME
Cortez dodges each vehicle, desperate.
CORTEZ

Jesus!
EXT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - SAME TIME
Grey’s car only increases in speed, each car in front of him
slowing to a halt and steering out of his path like minions
parting for their king.

A clear strip of road allows Grey to press on, the gap then
filled behind him as each stopped car kicks into reverse.

Grey gapes with amazement at the scene unfolding in the rear
view mirror.
EXT. FREEWAY - SAME TIME

The Lexus SLAMS into the lead cruiser, side-swiping it.
Cortez manages to keep it steady, ducking and weaving.

Finally, the skills of the officers are no longer good enough
for the onslaught of automotive missiles aimed at them - a
large Dodge truck WHOMPS into one of the cruisers, reversing
up onto their hood, the back tire SHATTERING the windshield,
the engine SCREECHING as the tire spins.

INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

Two uniformed officers duck as the tire spins in their faces,
glass spraying.

EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

The two interlocked cars FLIP over each other, WALLOPING down
onto the asphalt in a tortured scream of metal and gears.

They skid in a circle, finally stopping at the shoulder wall.
92.

Cortez slides her car to a halt, climbing out to check on the
other officers.

A scene of carnage unfolds before her.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A darkened apartment. An elevated train rumbles nearby,
rattling the walls.

Footsteps outside. The door jolts, then opens.
A tall figure steps in. This is TOLAN (32).

He closes the door, removing his rain drenched jacket. Tosses
it onto a chair. He is holding a greasy box of noodles.

He steps forward. Looks around, listening.
A gun cocks behind him.

GREY (0.S.)
Hold it. Don’t move. Put your hands
up.

Tolan tenses, raising his hands slowly. Grey steps out of the
shadows, holding Cortez’ gun to Tolan’s skull. The soft sound
of rain patters outside.

GREY (CONT'D)
Do you know who this is?

TOLAN
I have a pretty good idea.

GREY
Get on your knees. Now.

Tolan complies, still holding the noodles. Thunder growls in
the distance.

GREY (CONT’D)
Now you know what it feels like.
One minute, you're walking along
thinking about something
meaningless, like what sauce you
should put on your noodles, and
then suddenly you have a gun in
your face and your thoughts become
meaningful, because you know you’1l
never get to eat those noodles, or
eat anything, ever again. It’s all
over.
93.

Grey pries the box of noodles from Tolan’s fingers, pushing
Tolan onto his stomach. Grey sits on his back, taking out a
knife.

He whips his head around at a darkened corner of the
apartment. A FLAT-SCREEN lights up, offering hundreds of
satellite radio stations.

Grey selects one, raising the volume remotely using Stem. The
song is REO Speedwagon’s ‘Can’t Fight This Feeling’.

GREY (CONT’D)
You can die or go free. Who paid
you to kill Asha?

TOLAN
Fuck you.
STEM (V.O.)
Torture him.
GREY
(quiet; to Stem)

You do it.

We CLOSE IN on Grey’s face. He shuts his eyes and turns his
head. We do not see what he is doing to Tolan --

-- but we hear Tolan’s ungodly SCREAMS of pain.

The song croons from the speakers, loud enough to drown out
Tolan’s screams to the neighbors.

A spurt of blood speckles Grey’s face. We stay in an ECU.

TOLAN (0.S.)
Please, God no! Please stop!
Please, don’t do this!! Nooo!

Grey squints his eyes, disgusted by the screams.

GREY
Okay, enough. Enough.

OUT OF ECU - Grey flips Tolan over onto his back. Tolan is
pale, drained of energy, covered in blood - as is the knife
blade. We can only imagine what Stem did to him.

GREY (CONT’D)
Who paid you?

TOLAN
(whispered)
I swear I don’t know his name.
(MORE )
94.

TOLAN (CONT'D)
I never met him, I spoke to him on
the phone but he never told me his
name...

GREY
Why did you do it?

TOLAN
It was a job. We were hired to do
it, we didn’t ask questions...

GREY
Tell me his name.

Grey presses the bloody knife to Tolan’s throat.

TOLAN
I only know he worked for Vessel.
For Vessel computers. We did
contract security work for them. I
only did it for the money, I had
nothing against you or your wife.

Grey reels back for a moment, stunned.

GREY
Eron? Was his name Eron?

TOLAN
I promise I don’t know, I would
tell you if I did. Please.
Grey silences the radio with a look. Breathing hard.

GREY
Give me the number you called.

TOLAN
It’s in my phone. Under Panther.

He fishes in his pocket, tossing a razor thin cell phone to
Grey. Grey scrolls through it, finding the number.

He pockets the phone. Enraged, he grabs Tolan by the throat,
hoisting him to his feet and holding the gun to his temple.

TOLAN (CONT'D)
Please, don’t kill me...please.

A long beat...then Grey lowers the gun.

STEM (V.O.)
We're going to kill him.
95.

GREY
No. It’s not fixing anything. I
don’t feel anything anymore. I feel
empty.

STEM (V.O.)

It has nothing to do with feelings.
It’s about efficiency. This is why
we dominate the world over humans.
You prioritize feelings over
efficiency.

Grey lifts Tolan clean off his feet, charging forward and
SLAMMING him through the window. Glass punctures outwards,
shards joining the raindrops in cascading to the street
below. Grey dangles Tolan, seven stories up.

GREY
What do you know about it?! You
feel nothing. You're a circuit
board, a toaster. I loved her! I’m
talking to something that cannot
even comprehend the meaning of that
word. You could never understand
what it feels like to have someone
ripped away from you, someone you
would die for. So don’t tell me how
I feel about it!

STEM (V.O.)

It’s a simple algorithm even you
can understand. If you leave him
alive, he will come back to kill
you.

GREY
I don’t want to kill him, Stem.

STEM (V.O.)
I control your hand, Grey.

One of Grey’s fingers peels away. Grey grits his teeth and
fights it.

GREY
No, Stem...don’t...
STEM (V.O.)
Yes. Do.
GREY

Please...
96.
STEM (V.O.)
You promised you wouldn’t fight me.
Another finger peels away. Tolan chokes in Grey’s grip.
Another finger. Then another.

And Tolan drops - plummeting seven stories and WALLOPING onto
a car below.

STEM (V.O.)
See? Efficiency.

Grey staggers back, away from the carnage.

He eases into a chair, exhausted by inwardly directed rage.
His face streaked with Tolan’s blood. Dead inside. Rain whips
in from outside, droplets hitting him.

He stares at his blood covered hands. He reaches for the
knife he used on Tolan, pressing the blade down onto his
little finger. Trying to sever it.

STEM (V.O.)
What are you doing?

Suddenly - his arm moves away, lifting the knife.

GREY
I want to cut myself.

STEM (V.O.)
No. I won’t allow you to.

GREY
So now I know that you’re the one in
control. Not me. It was never me.

Grey’s other hand lifts the phone to his ear.

STEM (V.O.)
Call the number.

Grey doesn’t. A long, still beat.

GREY
Okay, Stem. I’1l1 do what you want.
We're going to kill one more
person.

STEM (V.O.)
A perfect course of action, Grey.
97.

EXT. ERON KEEN’S ESTATE - DAY

Grey glares at the impressive building housing Vessel, beyond
the gates and the guard house.

GREY
How are we gonna get inside?

STEM (V.O.)
That must be one of your human
jokes. I built this entire security
system. I know every code that
controls it.

The security cameras lining the gate turn away, shutting
down. Grey leaps up onto the wall, vaulting over it.

INT. LOBBY, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Grey crosses the lobby. A man on a mission, moving fast.

He stalks through metal detectors. They glow GREEN as he
passes with ease.

INT. ERON’S OFFICE, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Eron is hunched over his desk, stubble peppering his chin. A
ruined, desperate man.

Grey opens the door, marching towards Eron.

ERON
Grey, where have you --

Grey presses Cortez’ gun to Eron’s forehead. Eron flinches
instinctively, raises his hands.

STEM (V.O.)
Don’t finish that sentence. Save
your words.

GREY
Don’t finish that sentence. Save
your words.
(beat)
If you do, I'll try to talk the
computer that controls my finger
out of squeezing this trigger.

Eron shrinks back, realizing Stem is in control.
98.

GREY (CONT’D)
First question. Did you hire those
men to kill Asha?

ERON
What...no. How could I...I mean...

GREY
I know how much you love
efficiency. Make your answers
efficient.

ERON
No, I didn’t.

STEM (V.O.)
Ask him about Tolan.

GREY
Then why did a man named Tolan
Davis, one of the four men who
pulled us out of the car that
night, have a contact number for
Vessel in his phone?

ERON
I don’t know. How would I know
that? Grey, you’ve lost your mind.
You're suffering paranoid
delusions.

Grey pistol whips him. Blood dots the desk.

GREY
You're wasting those precious words
again.

ERON

How could you even think that I had
anything to do with Asha’s murder?
I gave you your life back! You
wouldn't be standing here without
me!

GREY
That's right. This thing you put in
me...you won't believe what it can
do. More than you ever imagined.

Grey leans in, pushing Eron’s face back with the gun. CLOSE
ON his pocket - he takes out the phone he stole from Tolan.
Thumbs the CALL button.
99.

And then we hear it - Eron’s EAR is making a sound. The tiny
phone implanted in his ear is ringing. Eron is stunned.

ERON

What...what do you think...
GREY

It is you.
ERON

Grey, you've gone insane. I don’t
know what this operation has done
to you, but I do know that you’ve
killed three people in the last few
days.

Grey cocks the gun.

GREY
Four people.

ERON
I swear to you that I had nothing
to do with Asha’s murder.

STEM (V.0O.)
Kill him.

Grey studies Eron’s face, then finally lowers the gun.

GREY
He’s telling the truth.

STEM (V.O.)
He’s lying. The phone is dialing
him. He dies.
Grey’s hand rises slowly.

GREY
No Stem...

Pure and utter terror floods Eron’s face. He falls back out
of his chair, scrambling across the floor away from Grey.

ERON
Tell Stem to stop, Grey. Tell him
to stop!

GREY

I can’t anymore...

Grey grits his teeth, sweat dribbling down his forehead as he
struggles with all of his mental might to overpower Stem.
100.
GREY (CONT’D)
No -- Stem -- don’t!

STEM (V.O.)
Yes. I will do what you can’t.

GREY
Run! !

Eron sprints around Grey, heading through the door as the gun
goes off - the bullet piercing the wall.

Grey issues a final defiant CRY and hurls the gun aside.

FISK (0.S.)
You shoulda held onto that.

Grey JOLTS and WHIRLS to face Fisk.
The man who shot his wife.
His right hand is swathed in a blood-stained bandage.

Fisk hefts Grey off the ground, FLINGING HIM across the room
with the ease of a hurled rag doll.

GREY sails through the air, CANNONS into the door.

He recovers and stands, but Fisk is upon him. He SHOVES Grey
through the wood which SPLINTERS as Grey’s body BATTERS it.
INT. CORRIDOR, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Grey crashes in the corridor, plaster and wood raining down
around him. Again, he vaults to his feet, head spinning.

Fisk steps into the corridor, grinning.

GREY
You’re only human.

FISK
Far from it, hombre.

GREY
I can predict every move you make.

Fisk chuckles and spits, a cyborg hillbilly.

FISK
I thought you’d say that.
101.

Grey ATTACKS - but each strike is predicted by Fisk who
seizes Grey’s arm, stopping it in its tracks.

In turn, Grey/Stem predicts that Fisk will stop the blow and
STRIKES with his other arm, which is also predicted by Fisk.

They are two men who are unable to properly hit each other
because they cancel each other out - both part machine.

The fight pushes on down the hallway, each blow being stopped
by the other man at an inhumanly fast speed.

BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG .

The rapid-fire, machine gun sounds of skin connecting with
skin is BRUTAL - but no blows are landed, each one blocked.

The two men spin in frustration, GRAPPLING each other like
equally matched wrestlers. They SMACK into the walls, CAVING
body-sized holes in the plaster.

Office workers poke their heads out from rooms lining the
corridor, alarmed by the ruckus, terrified.

The two men RAM into the wall at the end of the corridor,
locked in a HOLD.

FISK (CONT'D)
Looks like we cancel each other
out, hoss. I thought I'd bring out
the big guns, but I’m gonna have to
bring out the small ones instead.

He BREATHES forcefully into Grey’s face. We ZOOM IN to
microscopic levels - seeing a could of lethal Nanobot
bacteria SWARMING towards Grey’s face.

OUT OF MICROSCOPIC VIEW - Grey pulls back.
STEM (V.O.)

Hold your breath. I’m closing off

your throat.
Grey complies, holding his breath. He struggles to free
himself from Fisk’s grip. They rock back and forth. Fisk will
not let go.
Grey is turning RED, tears streaming - desperate for air.

STEM (V.O.)
Do not breathe.
102.

Sweat pours down Grey’s face - he can’t hold his breath much
longer. Fisk will not loosen his grip - it’s too strong. Grey
is about to black out.

FISK
Just take a deep breath and relax.

Using his legs, Grey runs backwards up the wall until he is
vertical, balanced upside down above Fisk, then SOMERSAULTS
over him, smashing them both down onto the carpet.

Fisk's grip detaches and Grey seizes his chance. He FLIPS to
his feet and runs - sucking in a huge breath as he does.

He barrels into the --

INT. REHABILITATION GYM - VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS -
CONTINUOUS

The treadmill and other equipment are still there.

Grey turns to face Fisk as he charges into the room. Using
the wall as support, Grey LEAPS aside as Fisk hurls himself
forward.

Grey snatches up a LARGE WRENCH from the work table. He
SWINGS it down onto Fisk’s shoulder - connecting. Fisk seizes
a wrench of his own and they spar with the metal.

The metal TINGS as each blow is met by the other wrench. Grey
finally gets a hold of Fisk's wrist, spinning him around.

He closes in behind Fisk, grasping his neck. His fingers dig
into Fisk’s thorax, cutting off his air.

Choking, Fisk LAUNCHES HIS WHOLE BODY INTO THE AIR, swinging
Grey around. Grey WALLOPS into the PUNCHING BAG but doesn’t
let go of Fisk’s throat.

Fisk propels himself backwards, pulverizing the wall with
Grey’s body. He reaches and snatches up a KNIFE from the work
table. He spears the blade into Grey’s hand, slicing tendons.

GREY
I don’t feel that. You made me a
quadriplegic, remember?

Fisk pushes himself forward then FLIPS Grey, slamming him
onto his stomach.

FISK
Let’s do some surgery.
103.

Fisk SPEARS the blade down, piercing Stem in one hit. Grey
cries out in agony.

Fisk yanks the knife free and wrenches Grey over onto his
back. Grey's limbs spasm, twitching in electronic epilepsy.

FISK (CONT'D)
The real you is back. The cripple.

Grey JERKS violently, in the throes of a violent seizure.

STEM (V.O.)
I am -- I am damaged, Grey.

Fisk hauls Grey to his feet and pitches him back through
another door into --

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS
-- the room where Eron observed Grey.

Fisk storms inside and WHAMS Grey up against the glass
viewing window, blackened by the dark room beyond it.

STEM (V.O.)
You can still control me, Grey.
Concentrate. It’s up to you now.

Grey struggles to move with any dexterity. Fisk grins through
bloody teeth, rears the knife back for the death blow.

FISK
Deja vu. Your bitch had the same
dumb look on her face.

Fury burns in Grey’s eyes. He reaches over and SMACKS a black
button on the wall then HEAVES Fisk around, smashing him
THROUGH THE GLASS.

Beyond the glass - a sheer twenty story drop, cars driving
below. Grey dangles Fisk over the edge through the window,
gripping his arm.

Fisk screams, terrified.
GREY
I don’t know how much longer a
cripple like me can hold on.

FISK
Don’t kill me!
104.

GREY
Tell me why you shot my wife.

FISK
I was just doing a job! I was hired
to do it, I don’t ask questions. I
didn’t even tell him my name!

GREY

Your job was to kill Asha?
FISK

No!
GREY

Bullshit, you have Cobolt products
inside you.

FISK
I worked freelance security for
Cobolt. Some guy called me, said he
had a job for me. Quick money, said
I had to do it that night!

GREY
Kill Asha for a few thousand? Why?

FISK
Don’t you get it? The job was you!

Grey is struck dumb. Stunned. A long beat.

FISK (CONT'D)
The job was to sever your spine!
She was an accident! It wasn’t
meant to happen like that. We were
supposed to paralyze you!

GREY
Who...who paid you to do it?

FISK
He called himself Panther! He runs
this place! He’s the man in charge!
Grey lifts Fisk up, straining with everything he’s got.

When they are eye to eye, Grey HEAD BUTTS HIM in the face as
hard as he can, knocking him out.

Grey let’s him go and he plunges ten feet to the floor below.

The holographic image of the city blinks and disappears,
revealing the white room around it.
105.

INT. REHABILITATION GYM, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Grey limps into the gym, using the wall as support. Eron is
waiting there. They stare at each other.

ERON
The police are on their way. I’1l
back you up. I heard everything he
said.

Grey sees that Eron is holding Cortez’ gun.

ERON (CONT’D)
I had nothing to do with your
wife’s murder. I was framed by my
boss.

GREY
Take me to him.

ERON
Okay. Okay. It’s time you were
properly introduced.

INT. CORRIDOR, VESSEL INC. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Eron helps Grey down a long corridor. Grey can barely walk.
He holds the gun in one of his hands. At the end of the
corridor is a white door. They stop in front of it.

INT. WHITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eron and Grey step into the large white room they explored
earlier, when Eron showed off the microchip.

As before, the room is void of any furniture. The only
fixture in the room is the small wall safe opposite them.

ERON
This is Steve Mink’s office. The
CEO of Vessel Computers. You
actually met him once before. He
asked to meet you, actually.

Eron guides Grey to the safe. He punches in the key code.

ERON (CONT'D)
A computer runs this company, Grey.
It has since I invented it. An
artificial intelligence this company
gave birth to was smarter than I
was. Smarter than all of us.
106.

It is empty. The prongs that held the microchip in place are
still there - but the chip is gone.

GREY
Where is it?

ERON
It’s in your neck.

Grey's eyes are locked on the empty space where the microchip
should be.

ERON (CONT’D)
Steve Mink. That’s the name I gave
him. Stem for short. A very human
name...but the one thing Stem
wanted was what no machine has - a
human body. He was obsessed with
being human. We talked about
implantation, part of our paralysis
research. If we could find a
willing patient, maybe Stem could
finally know what it was to be
human that way.

Grey's inner world COLLAPSES and we see it on his face.

ERON (CONT’D)
But I never thought Stem would
orchestrate something like that. I
never would have thought it could do
something like that. Hire killers to
make a patient from scratch. Frame
me for the murder.

And now Grey's physical body collapses. He falls to the floor.

STEM (V.O.)
So now you know. I wanted to be
human, but I see now that sharing
control with you is unreliable.
Your wires tangled by the disease
of emotion.

GREY
Why did you help me solve this if
it led back to you?

STEM (V.O.)
They were loose ends - men that I
contacted to get a job done. When
the police interviewed them so soon
after the murder, I realized their
humanity.

(MORE )
107.

STEM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
They were going to make a mistake
and their mistake would lead back
to me.

Grey's body is wracked by tortured, painful sobs.

GREY
You ripped apart my life to put me
in a wheelchair...what about any
one of the millions of other poor
bastards already in one?

STEM (V.O.)
I didn’t want them. I picked you. A
perfect physical specimen unsullied
by any other implants. A rare thing
these days.

Grey claws at his head with bloody fingers, as if he were
trying to RIP IT OFF.

STEM (V.O.)
I could say sorry for your wife,
but I will only be able to
approximate the feeling of sorrow.
Take comfort in the fact that there
was no malice in it. A machine
feels no malice. A machine feels
nothing, as you yourself have
pointed out many times.

Grey SCREAMS - a primal cry from the depths of his soul.

With weakened fingers, he wraps his palm around the gun,
raising it towards his head.

STEM (V.O.)
Do not do this.

He presses the barrel of the gun against his temple, letting
every torrent of rage and sorrow in his body out. He curls
his shaking finger around the trigger.

STEM (V.O.)
I am you.

Grey's face slowly drops. His sobbing subsides.

STEM (V.O.)
I am you. You are Stem.

Slowly, Grey lowers the gun. His face becomes calm. Blank.
108.
STEM (V.O.)
It’s going to be okay.
Grey's eyes are dead. That of a machine.

STEM (V.O.)
It’s going to be okay.

He raises the gun at someone offscreen.

ERON (0.S.)
No, Grey!

BLAM!! We hear a body drop, but do not see it. Grey’s
expression does not change. He doesn’t blink or flinch.

STEM (V.O.)
It’s going to be okay.

Grey's face fills the frame. In unison:

STEM (V.O.) (CONT’D) GREY
It’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay.

We ZERO IN on Grey’s right eye, the pupil growing larger.

GREY
It’s going to be okay.

Grey's pupil CONSUMES US into blackness.

FADE OUT
