NOTA

This film is extremely visual.

It is difficult to describe in words
without running the risk of losing or
boring the reader.

I have come up with a simplified summary,
therefore, like a reader's guide, which
will conjure up the images in as few words
as| possible:

- the beginning is LEON THE PROFESSIONAL
~ the middle is INCEPTION

- the end is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY

Don't interpret this as pretention on my

part, merely a visual, emotional and
philosophical point of reference.
FADE UP

CLOSE ona cell, seen through a microscope.
Opening titles.

The cell splits in two, then four, then eight...

With each new title card, life develops, methodically,
diligently...

CUT:

A prehistorical man and woman are arguing near a fire. It
appears that he wants to have sex with her, but she does not. A
few meters from there, a group of Neanderthals are looking at
them.

Title of the film appears:

Lucy

EXT. STREET, TAIPEI - SUNRISE

The first ray of the sun's light streams between the buildings
of Taipei, touching the face of LUCY, 25. Last night's make-up
caked on her skin. She has been up all night.

She wears a tight leopard print miniskirt, and is trying to get
her jacket on her bare shoulders. RICHARD, 28, is standing
next to her in vintage ray bans and a Bono-style Stetson.
Lucy takes a sip of her coffee from a Taiwanese Starbucks.

RICHARD
Lucy, it's easy as pie. In, out, all done
and dusted,

Lucy
So, why don't you do it yourself?

RICHARD
(syrupy)
For fun, that's all! The last thing
the guy is expecting is a total 10
turning up to deliver his case. It
will blow his mind. Cmon!

She takes another sip of coffee, turning her face to the sun.

Lucy
What's in it?
RICHARD
(shrugs)
Sweetheart! Don't get paranoid on
me! It's fifty feet! And I'm right
here! You trust me, don't you?
CUT:
FLASH of Lucy and Richard crazy on the dance floor.
FLASH of them drinking champagne and laughing.

FLASH of Richard filling a glass of champagne, and put a pill in it.
Lucy shoots it down, without noticing.

FLASH of Lucy laughing

FLASH of Lucy being taken by Richard in the restrooms.

The Neanderthals aren't far away.
BACK TO SCENE

Lucy
I gotta go.

Lucy kisses him on the cheek, starts to go. Richard looks
nervous, grabs her by the arm.

RICHARD
Hey, Lucy, Lucy!!! What are you
doing??

Lucy

I have exams on Monday, Richard.
So I'm gonna take a shower and
work!

RICHARD
Hey, you know the other day,
somebody dragged me to an
exhibit ion--something about
dinosaurs--and the first ever
prehistoric woman was right there.
Know what? Her name was Lucy.

INSERT:
The real prehistoric Lucy sits half-naked, gazing blankly at the
camera.

Back to scene:
Miniskirt Lucy stares at Richard.

Lucy
And that's supposed to make me
feel better?
RICHARD
(realizes)
Yeah, no, I mean... Sorry! I guess I
meant Lennon and McCartney's Lucy!

Lucy gives him a blank look.
Richard hums the tune.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
(sings)
Lucy in the sky with dia-a-a-monds!

Lucy rolls her eyes.

LUCy
T'll call you this week.

She's ready to go.
Richard grabs her again by the arm. On edge.

RICHARD
Lucy! Look, I can't deliver the case
myself. I had a little falling-out
with the guy. Nothing major but... If
we run into each other now, it's
gonna be a bit tense and who needs
that right now? If it’s you,
problem's solved. He takes the
case, end of story.

Lucy sighs.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
It'll take twenty seconds. You walk
in there, go up to reception and ask
for Mr. Wang. He comes down,
takes the case, you flash him your
prettiest smile and bounce. Look!
(MORE)
RICHARD (CONT’D)
You can see the reception from
here! I won't take my eyes off you.
T'll even press my nose up against
the window if you want.

Lucy peers inside the Imperial Hotel. Classy. Five stars.
‘And he's right, she can see the reception from where they're
‘standing, outside the big plate-glass windows.

INSERT:
‘A mouse scampers around a trap holding a juicy chunk of cheese.

‘Back to scene:
Lucy hesitates. Sighs.

Lucy
What's in the case?

RICHARD
Paperwork.

Lucy
Let's see.

RICHARD
Tt's locked and only Mr. Wang has
the code. I’m just the delivery boy.
Lucy glances at the handcuff dangling from the case handle.

LUCY
You mean, you get paid for this?

Busted.
Richard tries to laugh it of f.

RICHARD
Yeah... Kind of.
Lucy
How much?

RICHARD
(chuckles feebly)
Oh? We're negotiating now?

Lucy
No, I'm just curious how much you
get paid. Go on... How much?

RICHARD
(hesitates)
..A thousand. Dollars.

Lucy
A thousand dollars? For delivering
paperwork?

RICHARD
Babe! T don't know! From time to
time, I get given a case andI
deliver it toa hotel, period. It
takes me ten minutes and they pay
me agrand. The rest is none of my
business.

Lucy
(nervous smile)
You say you're gonna give me a ride
home,and in fact you want me to work
for youl

RICHARD
How's this? We split it down the
middle. Five hundred for you. Five
hundred for me.
Lucy
Richard, seriously. There's something
fishy going on here. You should be
careful.

‘She kisses him on the cheek and sets of f.
Richard catches her by the arm.

RICHARD
(irritated)
Listen, it's the third time this
week I'm showing up in the same
hotel with the same cowboy hat.
They gotta be suspicious.

Lucy grabs his Stetson and puts it on.

Lucy
Problem solved.

RICHARD
Lucy, Honey! I've done this a dozen
times! It's paperwork!

RICHARD (CONT'D)
Probably some designs they've
swiped so they can copy them.
That's how it works in this country.
Even my Stetson was made here!
Look! It says so on the label.

Lucy glances inside the hat. The label reads Made iin Taiwan.
She slips it back on his head.

Lucy
So long, cowboy witha fake Stetson!
She smiles, turns and walks away, really going this time.
Richard grabs her by the wrist.

RICHARD
Baby, please...

Lucy
T gotta go.

Ina flash, Richard slips the handcuff from the case handle
around her wrist.

INSERT:
The trap snaps closed on the foolhardy mouse.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(sighs)
What the... Richard! What the hell
are you doing?

RICHARD
(smiles)
Sorry. I really need your help.

He heads toward the hotel entrance. Lucy is forced to tag
along.

LUCY
(pissed of f)
Richard! Richard! Hold on a second!
What is this shit? Take this of f of
me right now!

RICHARD
(serious)
I don't have the key. Mr. Wang has
it. All you have to do is go into the
hotel and ask for him at the
reception desk.
(MORE)
RICHARD (CONT'D)
He'll come down with the key and
you'll be free to go.

Lucy
(firmly)
Take it of fll Right now!

RICHARD
Look, I'm sorry. I really have no
choice. I'll be watching you all the way.
The sooner you go, the sooner you'll be
back.

LUCy
T can't believe you did this to me.

RICHARD
I won't move from here. You have my
word.

Lucy
Your word isn't worth shit!

Richard counts out five hundred dollars and wedges the bills in her
cleavage.

RICHARD
It's worth five hundred bucks, at
least! And the money up front! Buy
yourself areal Stetson with it.
He grabs his hat back and puts it on.

Lucy glances around.

The street looks normal, the hotel is reassuringly quiet.
10.

LUCcy
(cold)
You're an asshole!

RICHARD
(warm)
You're wonderfull

'She sighs and heads for the hotel entrance.

INSERT:
A gazelle trots along in the savannah, under the avid gaze of a
prowling lion.

INT. HOTEL - DAY 4

Lucy pauses to adjust her skirt. She walks slowly across the
lobby, eyes darting this way and that, on the alert, but she
doesn't really know what she's looking out for--proof of some
kind of dirty trick, for sure.

Richard stands outside, pressed up against the glass, mocking her
paranoia.

INSERT:
The gazelle stands still, glances around.
Tn the long grass, the lions slip silently into position.

CONCIERGE
Miss?

Lucy's mind has gone blank. She can't even remember the guy's
name.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
(sweetly)
What can I do for you?
ll.

Lucy
Er... Wang? Mr. Wang?

CONCIERGE
(uncomfortable)
Yes?

Lucy
I'd like to see him.

The Concierge picks up the phone.

CONCIERGE
Who should I say is here?

Lucy
Richard. T mean... Mr. Richard sent
me.

The Concierge talks in Chinese to Mr. Wang.

CONCIERGE
And your name is...?

Lucy
I'm just here instead of Richard.
He's looking for somewhere to park.

The Concierge translates into the phone.
CONCIERGE
Mr. Wang still wants to know your
name.

INSERT:
The gazelle is anxious. The lions creep closer.

Lucy
Lucy.
12.

CONCIERGE
Lucy what?

Lucy
Lucy Lucy. That'll have to do. Tell
him to come down quickly because
I'm running late. I've got to get to
work and --

CONCIERGE
Just a second while I translate.

Beat. An awkward pause.
The Concierge hangs up.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
Mr. Wang's on his way. Stay right
here.

Lucy
(taken aback)
CanT sit?

CONCIERGE
Mr. Wang said you need to stay
right here, so I think it's better if
you stay right here.

Lucy's worried now. As if she's finally got proof that something
is not right.

The phone rings. The Concierge answers.

CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
Excuse me.

He continues the conversation in Chinese.
13.

Lucy sighs and looks around. Richard is still at the window,
smiling.

\Lucy makes a face, trying to exorcise her own fears.

It's too late for that.

‘Four goons get off the elevator and head for the reception
desk.

Lucy senses that trouble's coming her way. Female intuition is a
wonderful thing.

‘INSERT:
‘The gazelle has seen the lions looking at her.

Back to scene:
None of the goons weighs less than 100 kilos. Their jackets are
bulging with hardware.

Lucy begins quietly to freak out.
She frantically glances around at Richard, who gives her two
thumbs-up. Suddenly...

Asilent but deadly bullet thwacks into his back. Richard's chest
bursts open and paints the window red,

Richard collapses. Lucy is petrified.

The case slips from her grasp and dangles from the handcuff
chain,

INSERT:

The gazelle bolts.

The lions take off in pursuit.

Lucy turns back to the Concierge, but she can't get a word out.

Lucy
The... The... Police! Call the police!
14.

The four men close in around her.

TAO, the slender one, pushes the muzzle of his gun into her
back. He talks calmly, as if parking a car.

The Concierge translates for Lucy.

CONCIERGE
(tense)
He says to stay calm and
everything'll be fine.

INSERT:
The gazelle dodges a murderous swipe of a paw by inches.

Lucy nods. She sways and her eyes roll back in her head as if she's
about to faint, but two of the goons hold her up straight.

Tao puts a roll of dollar bills on the counter.

The Concierge takes it and ducks behind the counter.

Distant sirens wail.

‘The goons talk among themselves in Chinese, grab Lucy and haul
her toward the elevators.

In the furor caused by Richard's violent death, nobody
intervenes.

The elevator doors close.

INSERT:

Aheavy paw slams the gazelle to the ground.

The four lions dive in, like Lehman Brothers traders.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 5

Surrounded by the four goons, ina steel cage hurtling to the
‘25th and top floor, Lucy begins to shake uncontrollably.
15.

Lucy
(like a child)
Look, I've got nothing to do with all
this...
Fluid trickles down her leg.
Tao notices and steps back, witha few snarky remarks in Chinese.

‘The elevator doors open.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 6

‘The small group swooshes down the long hallway, the thick
carpet muffling their steps.

‘Lucy feels like she's being walked down death row.

At the far end, a sign on a door proclaims Royal Suite.

INT. ROYAL SUITE - DAY 7

‘The curtains are drawn, blocking out all but a few shafts of
light.

In one corner, the feet of three corpses are visible, piled on
top of each other.

Lucy pukes. Who can blame her?
‘The goons grab her before she collapses, and drop her in a chair.

Tao appears with a towel that he lobs at her for her to clean
herself up.
16.

‘Lucy doesn't react. She can't take her eyes off the heap of
‘corpses and signs of gruesome activities taking place in the
‘room next door.

‘Tao barks out some orders.

‘Agoon tugs the bedroom door closed to block out the sight of
the corpses, while another begins dabbing at Lucy with the
‘towel.

Lucy
(stammers)
T.. I haven't done anything...

‘Aman enters. Early fifties, three-piece suit, and blood dripping
‘from his hands.

With complete disregard for the carpet, a goon pours Evian
water on the man's hands so he can rinse them of f.

LUcy (CONT'D)
(terrified)
You... You speak English?

No answer.
The man meticulously wipes his hands and checks there aren't
any stains on his suit.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(in Spanish)
T know a little Spanish, too...

MR. WANG speaks Chinese and only Chinese.

Wang quizzes Tao, who replies.
The only word Lucy picks up is when Tao mentions her name.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Yes! I'm Lucy, but I haven't done
anything wrong! It's Richard.
(MORE)
17.

LUCY (CONT’D)

He told me to deliver the case.
Here... Take it, but don't feel you
have to chop my hand of f. Just cut
through the chain if you've lost the
key.

‘They pursue their discussion in Chinese. Apparently, there's a
‘problem.

Wang sighs and sits down.
‘He motions for Lucy to be brought over.

‘She struggles and squirms all she can. After all, nobody likes to
‘have their hand chopped of f.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Nol Please! I'm begging you!

She's pinned to a chair facing Wang across his desk.

Meanwhile, Wang makes a call and launches into another
discussion in Chinese.

Lucy finally begins to tire and calms down a little.
‘Wang activates the phone's loudspeaker.

PHONE VOICE
(strong Chinese accent)
Hello, miss. I speak English. I
translate you for Mr. Wang.

Lucy realizes that this voice is most likely her only hope.
‘She leans closer to the phone.

Lucy
Tell him I haven't done anything.
This is all a terrible mistake. I've
no idea what's in the damn case!
18.

PHONE VOICE
Hold on, hold on, not so fast.

The man on the phone translates for Wang, who asks a question.

PHONE VOICE (CONT'D)
Mr. Wang wants to know what's in
the case.
“INSERT:
‘Amouse runs round and round on a plastic wheel.

Lucy's final hope is dashed.
‘All alone in the world.

Lucy
But... I just told you I have no idea
what's in it! Do you speak English or
don't you?

PHONE VOICE
Yes, I do! I studied one year at
International High School in New
York. I studied a lot English.

‘The man speaks English like a 6th-grader.
Lucy tries her best to stay calm and speak clearly.

Lucy

Look! I swear... I have no idea what
is in that case! Richard gave it to
me outside the hotel and asked me
to take it to reception. That's all I
know. As for anything else, there's
no point torturing me, I don't know
a thing!

The phone voice translates.
On edge, Wang fires in another question.
PHONE VOICE
Mr. Wang wants to know where is
Richard.
She's floundering in a nightmare.
‘INSERT:
‘The mouse in the wheel, stops moving.

Tears run down Lucy's cheek.

Lucy
But... He's dead! Outside the hotel.
I thought your men had...

She glances at Tao, who remains as expressionless as a lump of
lead.

Lucy (CONT'D)

I don't know anymore... I don't get
it...

‘Wang stares at her, and issues a few orders and stands.

‘More goons arrive with Plexiglas shields to form a sort of wall
‘at one end of the room.

Helmets and gas masks are handed round.
‘Everybody gets kitted up. Except Lucy.

Agoon puts a piece of paper in front of Lucy.
LUCY (CONT'D)
They've put a note in front of me,
with numbers on it.

PHONE VOICE
It's the code to open the case.
20.

Lucy looks up and realizes why the whole gang is cowering behind
riot shields and wearing helmets and gas masks.

Lucy
What's in the case?

PHONE VOICE
Nothing dangerous.

LUCY
So why won't Mr. Wang open it
himself?

PHONE VOICE
He doesn't trust Mr. Richard.

LUCy
Tell him I didn't trust Richard
either so maybe the case should be
opened up someplace else.

The voice translates.
‘Mr. Wang scowls and brusquely motions to his men.
‘Lucy immediately has seven guns pointing at her.

PHONE VOICE
Mr. Wang insists that you open the
case.
Lucy doesn't really have a choice. She's terrified.
Lucy
(to herself)
Okay, okay...

One by one, she spins the wheels of the combination locks.
21.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(tears in her eyes)
Please... God... Help me...

‘She turns the fourth wheel. Nothing goes of f.
‘Except Wang, yelling impatiently.

PHONE VOICE
Now open the case.

Lucy takes a deep breath and... jerks the case open so fast that
everybody jumps back.

Lucy opens her eyes.

She's not dead.

Wang yells once more.

PHONE VOICE (CONT'D)
Can you describe the contents of
the case?

Lucy
Five transparent plastic pouches.
Filled with a bluish powder... Maybe
violet... Looks icky!

Lucy heaves a sigh. Her nerves are frazzled.

PHONE VOICE
Looks what?

LUCY
Icky!

PHONE VOICE

Euh... Do you have another word?
22.

LUCy
(with anger)
Sick! Dirty! Disgusting! Shit in
powder! Slumbag! You get it?!

The voice translates and Wang sends a goon forward.
' The goon pulls on gloves, takes out a box-cutter and delicately
slices open a packet.
‘He spoons a little of the spangly powder onto the table.

Lucy watches him apprehensively. Two goons haul a 40-kilo
wreck of a human being into the room. Probably Dutch. A real
dope fiend who's tried everything except detergent.

The dope fiend is dumped in front of Lucy. The poor guy is
absolutely devoid of reactions. A straw is placed in front of him.
He barely registers.

One of the goons takes the young Dutch guy's hand and gently
closes his fingers around a straw.

He urges him on, as if encouraging a child to finish his dessert.

The kid finally understands.
He positions the straw and snorts the spangly powder far up his
‘Nose.

The least you can say is that it wakes him up.

The Dutch guy spasms, twisting and jerking.

His muscles strain as if he's climaxing or beating the world
weightlifting record. He stands bolt upright like a bamboo plant.
He cackles, exploding with laughter.

He starts hitting the walls, babbling in Dutch.

Lucy gawks at him.
Wang peers at the guy, studying his reaction intently.

The dope fiend starts banging his head against the walls, then
he contorts as if racked with convulsions.

The guy's going to blow. It’s obvious.
Wang motions to a goon.
23.

_ The goon wastes the young guy like a lab rat that's outlived its
usefulness, It takes five bullets, then a dozen more, to keep
the flying Dutchman down.

Lucy's face is spattered with blood,

She is in horrorland. On a one-way ticket.

' The goon with gloves on reappears and pokes at the contents of
‘the case witha chopstick and a little mirror to check there are
no mechanisms underneath the pouches.

LUCY (CONT'D)
What are you going to do with me
now? Kill me? Is that the plan? Now
I've seen all this, you're gonna say
you haven't got any choice, T
suppose. It was too easy just to let
me go, wasn't it?

“The voice translates.
‘Wang just sits stony-faced while the goon completes his slow,
-painstaking inspection.

‘Denied a response, Lucy heaves a sigh.
She watches the sweat-soaked goon raising and peering under
each plastic packet.

‘Suddenly, Lucy pulls the pouches out one by one. She deposits
them on the table as if unpacking her groceries.

Wang stares in astonishment.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(trying to pull herself
together)
OK... Look... You got what you want...
Can I go now?... Please?
24.

| The translation takes some time, but it's worth it: for the
first time, Wang cracks a smile.

PHONE VOICE
Mr. Wang has a counter-proposal for
| you.
Lucy
Oh?
PHONE VOICE
He's offering you a job.
Lucy is speechless.
LUCY

A job?
Agoon comes over.
| Lucy looks up just in time to see his fist crunching into her
‘face.

INT. LECTURE HALL, PARIS - DAY

_ PROFESSOR NORMAN, late 40's, gives a lecture to packed
_rows of students.
25.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Tf life starts approximately a
billion years ago then we will have
to wait 400,000 years to see the
aberration of the first nerve cells.
This is where life as we know it
begins. Brains in formation of only a
few milligrams, there is no way to
determine any sign of intelligence
yet, it acts more as a reflex. One
neuron, you are alive. Two neurons
you're moving, and with movement
that's when interesting things begin
to happen.

INSERT:
‘A huge "5%" fills the screen.

[RAPID MONTAGE:

‘A cheetah hunting / a sea otter breaking opena sea urchin on
‘its belly witha stone / a bear fishing / an eagle fishing / a
gazelle standing on its hind legs to reach low-hanging leaves /a
dog running in circles before settling down / a cat playing witha
little ball.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
Animal life on earth goes back
millions of years, yet most species
use barely 3-5% of their brain's
capacity. Rats, foxes, and crows are
patently smart and organized, but
it's only when you reach human
beings, at the top of the animal
chain, that you finally see a species
using more of its cerebral capacity.

INSERT:
A huge "10%" fills the screen.
26.

INSERT:
| Aprehistoric man bangs two rocks together and grins happily.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
10% seems very little, but is really
quite a lot when you look at all we've
done with it.

RAPID MONTAGE:

‘Adam / a washing machine / a bike / a rocket / an electric
juicer / a soccer match on TV / the Eiffel Tower / a satellite /
bank notes rolling off a printing press / a trading floor / an
operating room / a swathe of solar panels / an Indian temple /
thousands of containers stacked on docks / a fashion show / a
robot building acar / the pyramids in Egypt / the pyramid in the
Louvre / a steel ball on a thread striking the first ball ina
_series and provoking perpetual motion.

The prehistoric man cracks the two rocks together until sparks
‘begin to fly and kindling catches fire.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
Despite all these wonderful
inventions and undisputable
ingenuity we are prisoners of the
natural selection so dear to Darwin -
- adapt to one’s environment or die.
Now let's discuss a special case --
the only living being that uses its
brain better than us. The dolphin.

_Agiant photo of a dolphin appears on the screen behind the
Professor.

-A student nudges his pretty neighbor and flashes the dolphin
‘tattoo on his shoulder.
27.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
My dear Jean, it will take more
than a tattoo for you to be its
equal.

More laughter in the hall. Jean smiles sheepishly.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
It is estimated that this
exceptional animal with its
permanent and beautiful smile uses
up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.
In particular, this allows it to have
an echolocation system that is far
more efficient than any sonar
invented by mankind, but the
dolphin didn't "invent" the sonar, it
“developed” it naturally, and this is
the crucial part of our philosophical
reflection that we have today. Can
we therefore conclude, that humans
are concerned with "having" rather
than “being,” and in fact “invent”
only what they would be capable of
developing naturally if they took
the time and, of course, if they
used their brains a little better.

INT, ROOM

ECU as Lucy opens one eye.

She isn't dead, but isn't sure just yet if that's a good thing.

In bra and panties, she's stretched out on an examining table in

aroom that looks vaguely like a recovery room.

Lucy sits up, but is immediately gripped by a terrible pain in her
stomach.
10

28.

| She looks down and sees that her whole lower gut is bandaged
up, as if she's been subjected toa particularly incompetent C-
‘section.

|It hurts, but she still manages to sit up.

What worries her more than the pain is not knowing what
‘exactly they've done to her. She sees a bottle of painkillers
‘next to her and takes two.

‘Two guards enter, startling her.
They throw over a bag of clothes and motion for Lucy to get
‘dressed.

INT. LIVING ROOM 10

Very European-style decor, kind of “rich Asian wants his very
own Versailles." Only the maids in traditional dresses remind us
that we are in Asia.

Lucy arrives wearing a denim skirt, flat shoes and white t-shirt.
Definitely not dressed to kill.
She is flanked by the two guards, who open a door, revealing a
‘magnificent library.

Mr. Wang sits cradling a glass of brandy.
Two white men in designer suits are with him. Clearly not human
_rights activists or charity workers.

‘Lucy walks forward.
| Wang smiles. This bastard looks almost happy to see her again.

Lucy
What have you done to my stomach?

One of the mucky-mucks answers instead of Wang.
He has an English accent that's so thick you could cut it witha
knife.
29.

THE LIMEY

(smiles)
It's just a little horizontal slit. But
it's very well done. You'll see, ina
month the scar will be practically
invisible. You'll be able to show your
tummy off on Miami Beach next
summer.

Lucy
It's not the scar that worries me --

THE LIMEY
It's why we opened you up?

' Lucy nods apprehensively.

The Limey smiles, like a white shark.

THE LIMEY (CONT'D)
Rest assured, we didn't harvest any
of your organs. We merely slipped a
small packet into your lower tummy.
Tt will be removed as soon as you
arrive in Los Angeles.

LUCY
It's... It's a packet of the powder
that... that was in the case?

Lucy is marched to the far end of the room, next to four men.
Two of them have no shirts on, revealing bulky bandages on
their stomachs.

‘Lucy does the math: five packets in the case, five mules,
A Chinese gangster hands out passports and plane tickets.

THE LIMEY
(typically British
politeness)
Good morning to you, gentlemen and
lady. First of all, many thanks for
taking part in this experiment,
which I'm sure will go of f
flawlessly. These passports and
tickets will enable you to return
home within the next twenty-four
hours. Upon arrival, you will be
taken in hand by our people, so that
we might recover our merchandise
and you might rediscover the
freedom you so richly deserve.

THE LIMEY (CONT'D)

I'm sure I don't need to remind you
that if you are apprehended by the
police, you run the risk of up to ten
years in prison. As for those of you
who may be tempted to warn or
hand themselves in to the
authorities, may I point out we have
the names and addresses of the
families of every one of you, down
to the most distant cousins.
Therefore, we rely on your
complete discretion.

‘Lucy looks at her comrades in misfortune as if they were
already dead.

THE LIMEY (CONT'D)
But enough of my speedy lying.
Gentlemen, lady... allow me to wish
you “bon voyage!"

The guards rush over and pull hoods over the guinea pigs’ heads.

The Limey is intrigued by Lucy and moves closer, standing

facing her, an amused smile flirting across his lips.

Lucy
You're gonna kill thousands of
people with this shit!

THE LIMEY

(smiles)
We all have to die sometime,
darling, but before death, there
will be pleasure! No more grief, no
more pain. For a few brief
moments, the sense of being king of
the world, of being immortal. And
forgetting the crappy one they live
in,

‘Lucy is the last of the mules to be hooded.
‘BLACKOUT.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (0.5S.)
For primitive beings like us, life
seems to have in reality one single
purpose: To go through time.

12 INT. LECTURE HALL, PARTS - DAY 12
Professor Norman stands facing it's students.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Going through time seems to be the
only real purpose of each of our
cells.To achieve that aim, the mass
of cells that makes up the
earthworm and the human being has
only two solutions: to be immortal
or to reproduce.

_Aslide flashes up with two words in caps:
'IMMORTALITY/REPRODUCTION.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
It will develop a perfect system of
consumption and recycling of all it has.
Such is the case of carcinogenic cells,
for example. They are cells that
consider their environment -- the body
that houses them -- to be
insufficiently propitious. Thus, they
change their way of functioning. On
the other hand, if the habitat is
favorable...

essential information to another
cell, which passes it on to another,
and so on...

34.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
Millions of our cells die every day,
to the extent that none of the cells
that constitute our beings now
were present on the day of our
birth.
So the body of our childhood is no
longer there, but the spirit remains.
And that reveals the full complexity
of our existence: our body accepts
dying a little bit every day, while our
spirit doesn't, and is afraid of only one
thing: death.

BLACKOUT.

We hear Lucy's breathing. Hard and fast. Like her heartbeat.
Fear in her belly.

Gradually, we sense a little more light.

|The sound of an engine. The city.

Through the thick weave of the hood into Lucy's private sphere.
Her eye. Her mouth. Mumbling to herself.

Lucy
.. Lucy... Keep calm. You have to
wait, play for time. You'll have time
to think it through on the plane.
Yes, that's right. Take that flight.
Get out of here. Don't try anything
yet. Keep your cool. You're alive,
that's all that matters. Wait...
Wait... Wait...

13 INT. ROOM 13

Suddenly, the hood is ripped off. Bright, dazzling light.
Straight into poor Lucy's face.
35.

Change of setting. Some kind of warehouse .

She's in a padded room--the kind of room where you can scream
_all you like and not have to worry about upsetting the neighbors.

"Set in the far wall is a large ring with a meter-length of chain
dangling from it.
"Three men haul Lucy over there and handcuff her to the chain.

‘The three guys babble away in Chinese.
The way they leer at Lucy leaves no doubt about the subject of
their conversation.

One of them comes over and touches her hair, as if feeling for
quality.
Lucy stiffens, but simply moves her head away from his hand.

Lucy
Please... no...

_ The second guy clasps her breast with one hand, as if testing a
‘melon at a market stall for ripeness.

Lucy gives him a free taste of her fist witha side order of
handcuff chain.

LUCY (CONT'D)

(fiery)
I'm not in the mood!

The goon freaks out and punches her back, in the face.
Lucy falls back and he kicks her in the gut several times.
: Lucy's eyes nearly pop out in agony.

One of the other guards grabs his buddy and hustles him out.
They lock and bolt the door, leaving Lucy writhing in pain,
_gasping for breath and clutching her stomach.
14

36.

The camera closes in, closer and closer on her stomach, until
the view penetrates the fibers of her bandages.

INT. LUCY'S BODY 14

The camera enters Lucy's skin like an endoscope.
The view penetrates her flesh until it focuses on one of the

corners of the plastic packet.
It looks like underwater footage of the exploration of the
Titanic,

The view tracks alongside the packet, until it reaches the bow.
Just like the Titanic, it’s split open.
The kicking from the Chinese guard has ruptured the pouch.

| The dope spills out like fluid.

It's like the milky way--sparkling, skipping, shifting, purple,

blue, red... It rockets through her system, like a firework, a

luminescent streak lighting up her veins from the inside and

making the walls of the vein phosphorescent.

Whenever a vein branches off in two directions, the streak of
powder splits up. We follow one all the way to the huge valve
that gives access to the heart, like a sacred entrance toa
temple. The fluid engulfs the heart.

‘Lucy contorts in pain, like a wriggling earthworm.

After seeing what one gram of C.P.H.4 did to the Dutchman, it's

- easy to imagine the effect of one kilo.

_ Her body twists into insane, completely dislocated positions,
‘like a fish out of water or a garden hose gone wild.

She spins round and round like a top, hitting herself all over.
The sounds that come out of her mouth are inhuman, more like

_ the grunts of a fatally wounded animal. She slithers across the
floor on her back, pushes against the wall and starts sliding up

it. Dream and reality converge.

Finally, Lucy raises herself up, lets out a bloodcurdling scream
vand charges into the wall head first.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
For the moment, it is just a
hypotheses. I confess, there's
nothing very scientific about it. We
are just a group of nerds playing
with old theories, but if you think
about it, it is very disturbing that
the Greeks, the Egyptians, and the
Indians, have already some notions
of cells many centuries before we
invented the microscope, and what

Lucy's eyes flit wide open. Her retina changes, going through a
‘spectrum from cat to reptile to bird, before becoming human
“again.

There is aglint in her eyes that we haven't seen before.

‘ Something cold, jagged, primal... Something animal.

She picks herself up with no apparent pain, stares at the backs

_of her hands, cracks her neck...

_Lucy grabs a chair and sits down, back straight, palms on her
_ knees, eyes jet black. Lucy is a changed woman.

‘the table and glances at Lucy as she sits motionless in the
corner.

Lucy doesn't take her eyes off him.

Hands on hips, the guy gazes back at her.

_ The guy is given an unobstructed view up her denim skirt.

‘He smiles at her open invitation, checks there's no-one in the
‘hallway, locks the door and walks over.

"Just incase it's a trap, he leaves the key in the lock and his gun
on the table, where Lucy can't reach it because of the chain.

‘He stands in front of Lucy and slips his hand between her legs.

It's the last move he'll ever make.
Lucy snaps her legs closed on his hand. The man howls.

INSERT:
_ Like a fox when a pincer trap snaps closed on its leg.

Snakelike, Lucy strikes. Wraps the chain round the guy's throat.

His neck snaps and he falls lifelessly to the floor.

Lucy moves fast, as if she has it all planned out, as if killing a

guy for the first time means nothing to her.

| She tears his pant legs into strips, winds them together, puts

them end to end and knots them into a length of homemade

“rope.

She picks up the chair, shatters it on the floor and ties the U-

. shaped frame of the front legs to the end of her rope.
‘It's all done in under ten seconds, with chilling composure.

With her makeshift grappling hook, Lucy snags one leg of the

‘Lucy slinks swiftly down the empty hallway, her eyes still

‘Lucy.

‘CUT: 4 cheetahs run at full speed on the plain. A Gazelle is right
ibehind chasing the cheetahs.

‘Back to scene

Lucy's in a hurry.

i She wastes the first two guys at point-blank range.

‘The other two dive for cover, but Lucy skirts the table and
plugs the third player.

‘Despite his extreme panic-stricken state, the last guard has
imanaged to draw his gun.

He shoots Lucy in the shoulder. She rocks back but barely even
grunts. Then blows him away with a bullet to the brain.

Lucy lobs her empty gun onto the table, grabs the bottle of
‘booze and chugs half of it down. She sits down and devours the
‘half-eaten sandwiches as if she hadn't eaten for a week,

‘Her cheeks still bulging with the last of the sandwiches, she
digs into her shoulder wound and plucks out the bullet, which
ishe tosses into a glass of water.

_ She picks up the glass and peers at the bullet, magnified by the
jrefraction effect. It fascinates her. For a second.

Lucy
I want to know everything about
this molecule.

She gives him no choice.

SURGEON
Pregnant women fabricate this
extremely powerful molecule in the
sixth week of pregnancy. In tiny
quantities. But for a baby it packs
the punch of an atomic bomb. It's
what gives the fetus the necessary
energy to form all the bones in its
body. This sudden surge of energy
happens only once ina lifetime.

» Lucy puts her gun down next to aroll of dollar bills and hitches

up her t-shirt slightly. She has two knives tucked in the back of
her skirt.

: She whips them out in a flash, the blades swooshing through the
. air, and drives them viciously into the tops of Wang's hands.
58.

The mobster screams so hard the slices of cucumber go flying.
He is crucified to the chair. Gripped by pain, he barely moves.
The earbuds fall out. Mozart floats faintly around the room.

Wang's mouth gapes open but no sound dares to emerge.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(mimics him)
Ah! Aaah? You see?

Her voice mellows, becomes almost intimate, as if relieved to
share her ordeal with someone.

Lucy (CONT'D)
Learning's always a painful process.
It's like when you're little and your
bones are growing. It makes you
ache all over.

Lucy frowns. Her somber eyes mist over.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Can you believe that I can
remember the sound of my bones
growing? An inhuman sound muffled
by flesh. Now it's different... Every
sound is music I can understand,
like a mathematical equation.

Wang looks at her like a puppy dog with his front paws caught ina
trap.

LUCY (CONT'D)
You see, it's funny. I spent years
trying to find out who I was and
what I wanted to do. But the only
answer I came up with was to have
fun and make a mess of my life.
(MORE)
59,

LUCY (CONT'D)
And now that I have access to the
furthest reaches of my brain, and I
see things clearly. I sense my
humanity slipping through my
fingers, and nothing seems to
matter anymore. As if humanity
were only a primitive stage on the
road to knowledge. Understand?

Mr. Wong is too busy writhing in pain. She moves closer. Gently
strokes his cheek.

LUCY (CONT'D)
You have to learn how to get over
your pain. It blocks you, it stops you
from understanding. It blocks
knowledge. You live in your little
world of profit, fed by war, misery
and chaos. You want to escape your
pain by putting your burden onto
others. You live without sharing, and
it's centuries humans are acting like
this . Don't you think it's time we
share it all? Don't you want to have
access to knowledge? Because right
now you know nothing.

She grabs a cucumber
Lucy (CONT'D)
Except that cucumber is good for
your skin.
She eats the piece of cucumber.
Lucy

So tell me, where are the others?
The other guys carrying the drugs?
60.

Wang doesn't respond, of course. He didn't understand a word
of what she said and the only thing he can think about is the
excruciating pain.

Lucy peers at him. Slowly presses her hands over his.
Concentrates,

She penetrates the man's skin, cuts through layers of muscle
and into his nervous system. In a few seconds, she has traveled
these information highways to his brain. She hurtles toward his
cortex and enters the black box of his memory. An image
forms: Lucy is back in the mansion where she met the four
other mules.

INSERT:

Lucy moves around invisibly like a mobile voyeur-camera capable
of zooming in and out, becoming endoscopic, freeze-framing and
tracking around objects if necessary.

Lucy explores the setting and people, as if visiting a 3-D mock-
up of a kitchen on a computer.

A goon checks the passport of one of the mules.
Freeze-frame.

We see the guy's photo and name.

Lucy
(reads the name)
Louis Bertrand.

The goon hands Louis his passport and ticket.

Freeze-frame.

The view slips into the pouch containing the ticket and reads
the time and destination. BRUSSELS 08:20.

BACK TO SCENE:
Wang doesn't realize his mind is being searched and pillaged.
Lucy focuses.
31

61.

INSERT:

Wang flicks through another passport.

The camera closes in on his face, zooms into his eye until we
see the writing on the ticket.

The frame is reversed so we can read it the right way round.
MUNICH 10:30.

Wang watches the third mule preparing to leave the room.
Freeze-frame.

The camera comes up behind the guy.

The view slips into the back pocket of his pants and into the
ticket holder.

We can make out his name and flight number. ROME 09:10.

BACK TO SCENE:

In the hotel room, Lucy removes her hands from Wang's.
He looks drained.

Lucy shoots him a kindly, sympathetic smile.

Lucy (CONT'D)
Thank you for sharing.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY 32

Rivulets of sweat run down the Driver's face.
He's trying to insert a length of wire into the hole to replace
the pin of one of the grenades.

His hand is shaking.
When he finally succeeds, he heaves a huge sigh of relief.

Suddenly, Lucy jumps into the car and lobs him the keys.

Lucy
See? You're smarter since you met
me!
(in Chinese)
Cmon, drive!
62.

Even after deactivating the grenades, the Driver is still ina
state of complete panic.

The car drives off into Taipei.

32 INT. THREE STAR HOTEL, PARIS - NIGHT 32

Professor Norman arrives back at his hotel room, a junior suite.
He removes his shoes and rubs his feet, wincing.
Picks up the phone.

CONCTERGE (0.S.)
Evening, Professor.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Good evening, Nicole.

CONCIERGE (0.S.)
The usual?

PROFESSOR NORMAN
No, I think I'll have the lasagna
tonight. For a change. With a glass
of white wine like the one you dug
out for me last night.

CONCIERGE
Yes, sir. Be up in ten minutes.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Take your time.
33 EXT. STREET, TAIPEI - DAY 33

The car pulls up outside a building.
Lucy jumps out with her bag. Leans toward the Driver's window.
34

63.

Lucy
Thanks for the ride.

She lobs him a tightly tied roll of cash that she took from
Wang's room.

She walks into her apartment building.
Dazed, the Driver pulls away.

INT.LUCY'S APARTMENT - DAY 34

The door is opened by CAROLINE, 22, blonde, in panties and
top--the original slacker starting to make her way in the world.

CAROLINE
Shit, you gave me a fright ringing
the bell like a headcase!

Caroline steps forward and gives Lucy a hug.

Lucy immediately forms a complete picture of her friend's
body: bones, muscles, veins, waves, equations, everything.
Ascan from head to toe in five seconds.

Caroline steps back. Lucy is slightly in shock.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
(sweetly)
T missed you.

LUCY
(perplexed)
Me too.

CAROLINE
Have you lost your keys?
64.

Lucy
Something like that. Can I use your
laptop?

CAROLINE
Uh... Sure.

Lucy heads into the living room, sits straight down at the
computer and types at mind-blowing speed.

Caroline flops on the couch and goes back to painting her nails.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
You're into computers now.

Lucy
Yup. It's all new.

Lucy browses scientific websites. So fast, it's impossible to
keep up.

CAROLINE

I spent all day yesterday going to
auditions. Well... Going to two
auditions. It was so boring! They
keep you waiting for hours, gabbing
away in Chinese. You don't
understand a word they say, then at
the end they say they'll call you but
they don't even take your number.

(smiles)
Except one guy. But he wasn't
Chinese. A guy from the agency. The
cute-and-I-know-it kind.

Lucy digests a huge quantity of scientific papers at phenomenal
speed.
65.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
(grins)
You'll never guess where he took
me!
Lucy

(riveted to the screen)
The Four Seasons. The Royal Suite.
And you made love all night long.

CAROLINE
(stunned)
How did you know?

Lucy
Lucy looks at her friend, they are obviously on different levels
of consciousness, but Lucy still has a dollop of compassion for
this girl.

LUCY (CONT'D)

(sympathetic)
Caroline, I don't have a lot of time,
so you must listen to me very
carefully. At first you will not
understand what I'm saying, you're
going to reject it. Then the
emotion will overwhelm you and you
will start crying. Then you will start
to understand. To feel what I am
saying is true. You won't accept it,
you'll fight it, you'll cry some more.
And then you will start screaming at
me. You're going to go through all
this before you can accept what is
true. Are you ready?

CAROLINE
Ready for what? What truth are
you talking about. Lucy, you're
scaring me.
66.

Lucy takes a deep breath.

Lucy
His name's Franco. He’s HIV-
positive but he doesn't know it yet.
Trouble is, you are biologically
vulnerable to contamination. Your
kidneys don't operate very
efficiently and your liver's in bad
shape because of all the shit you've
put through it since you were 13.

Her tone is clipped, devoid of emotion. Caroline is frozen,
stunned, the nail polish in her hands.

LUCY (CONT'D)
You have to make some changes in
your life. Work out, eat organic,
stop partying, and you'll buy
yourself a few more years. By then
they'll have come up with something.

CAROLINE
“Come up with something?”

Lucy
A treatment.

Lucy goes back to the computer.
Caroline's beautiful eyes begin to fill with tears.

CAROLINE
Lucy, is this some kind of joke?

Caroline begins to cry. Lucy concentrates on the computer.
67.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Why are you telling me all this? You
don't know what the fuck you're
talking about. First, you don't even
know Franco. You never met him.
Did Richard tell you this crap? Is
that it? Richard is a jealous little
shit because I wouldn't fuck him.
He'll do anything to hurt me.

Caroline cries more. Lucy continues typing.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Why are you being so mean to me? T
know my life is a little messed up,
but it's not any reason to throw it
up at me like this. I've always been
your friend, I've always told you all
my secrets. Everything. I trusted
you, Why are you trying to hurt me
like this?

Her anger begins to rise... just as Lucy said it would,

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
You think you're better than me?
Look at you? You're 25 and you're
still working as a salesgirl ina
second-hand clothes store to pay
your way through college. So maybe
you're more intelligent than me
because you had a little more
school, but what have you done with
your fabulous education? Huh?
You're like me! Still lost, trying to
find who the hell you are. and while
you wait for the ‘great’ answer all
you do is party in the same clubs as
me, so what is your fucking problem
that you have to lay this shit on me.
68.

Coroline is desperate. Tears flow uncontrollably.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
And why are you saying I'm sick?
That's not true! It's not! Tell me
you were just making it up. Tell me
it's not true!

Lucy is still silent, typing away.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
(screaming)
Look at me whenT talk to youllll!

Lucy prints out a page in Chinese. She grabs the page, jumps up
and thrusts it toward Caroline.

Lucy
Here... It's a prescription. Go to the
pharmacy and start your treatment.

CAROLINE
(amazed)
Since when do you speak Chinese?!

Lucy
(honestly)
About one hour.

Bemused, Caroline holds the prescription in her fingertips.
Trembling.

CAROLINE
Lucy... I don't understand any of
this.
35

36

69.

LUCy
(gently)

T know, but do what I told you. Pull

some pants on and go down to the

pharmacy. I don't want you to die.
Lucy means it, but she’s ina hurry and turns back to the laptop.
Ina daze, Caroline pulls on some jeans and heads out.

On the laptop, Lucy seems to have found what she was looking
for.

A photo pops up.
We recognize Professor Samuel Norman of Boston University.
INT. PROFESSOR NORMAN'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 35

The Professor sits at the table, holding a report in one hand and
finishing of f his lasagna with the other.

The phone rings. The Professor looks surprised.

He stands and goes into the small living room to answer the
phone.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Yes?

INT. LUCy’S APARTMENT - DAY 36
Lucy sits at the laptop, She has an earpiece in.
Lucy
Professor Norman.? My name’s Lucy.

T've just read all your research on
the human brain. We need to meet.
70.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(smiles)
All my research? I'm flattered,
young lady, but I find you a little
presumptuous. I must have written
no less than --

LUCy
6,734 pages. I can recite them to
you by heart, if you wish,

The Professor smiles and sits ina chair.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Who is this? Are youa friend of
Emily's? This sounds like one of her
silly little jokes. Is she with you?

The TV in the living room switches on all by itself.
Lucy's face, filmed by the laptop's webcam, appears.

LUCy
No, I'm all on my own.

The Professor is stunned.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Who are you?

Lucy
I just told you.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Yes, Lucy, sorry...

Lucy
I've read your theory on the use of
the brain’ ity.
e brain's capacity
71.

Lucy (CONT'D)
It's a little rudimentary but you're
on the right track.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(dumbstruck)
Thank you.

Lucy
Look, I don't have much time. My
cells are reproducing at a
phenomenal speed. Several million
per minute. I'm still having trouble
precisely evaluating the time of my
death, but I doubt I'll hold out
more than 48 hours.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(confused)
What are you talking about? I... I'm
not sure I follow you.

Lucy
Due to a convergence of
circumstances beyond my control, I
absorbed a substance that gives me
access to 28% of my cerebral
capacity, and counting. I've gained
5% in the last three hours because
once you reach 20%, you have
enough capacity to open up the rest.
There are no more obstacles. They
fall one after the other, like
dominos. I'm colonizing my brain
minute by minute. The knowledge
that's in me explodes every
second...

There's ahint of sadness in Lucy's voice. Regret.

The Professor is simultaneously concerned and fascinated.
72.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Look, I... I don't know what to say...
I've been working on this theory for
twenty years, but it's only ever
been hypotheses and research
ideas. I never thought... I mean...
That one day somebody... You have
control of your body?

LUCy
Yes. And I'm starting to control
other people's bodies. I can also
control electric and magnetic
waves. Not all of them, just the
most basic--radio, TV, telephone...

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(awed)
That's amazing.

Lucy
What amazes me is that we've lived
for so long in such ignorance.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
You can feel... everything?

LUcy
(hint of sadness)
Yes.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
That must be unbearable.

Tears run down Lucy's cheeks. She takes one and studies it.

Lucy
Yes.

(beat)

(MORE)
37

73.

LUCY (CONT'D)
I know no fear, pain, distress,
desire, grief or love anymore... And
it's a constant battle for me to
stay human. So it doesn't fade away.
To cling to a trace of what I was.

The Professor is worried for her.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
If you don't want to lose
everything, you have to pass it on.
All this astonishing knowledge, all
this learning you are acquiring can
help others, the whole of humanity.
You have to pass on your knowledge,
like a simple cell would to keep
going through time.

LUCY

(pensive)

Time... Yes...

(beat)
T'll be at your door in 12 hours.

She hangs up.

The Professor sits totally dazed, trying to get his head around
what's just happened.

INT. TAIPEI AIRPORT - DAY 37
Lucy has changed. She walks through Taipei airport.

Her eye scans headlines of Chinese newspapers. She's all over the
front pages. Wanted!

Suddenly, her hair gets longer and becomes black and straight.
She pulls on dark glasses and dials a number on her cellphone.
38

74.
INT. PARIS POLICE DEPARTMENT 38

Three cops are laughing about an assignment when the phone
rings on PIERRE DEL RIO's desk. Del Rio is 30ish, witha
likable expression that more cops should try.

He sits on the edge of his desk and agswers.

DEL RIO
Yes?

VOICE
Sorry to bother you, captain, but
Tve received a strange call from an
American citizen living in Taiwan. A
young woman. She claims to have
information on a major drug ring.

Pierre's curiosity is aroused. A little.

DEL RIO
(jokily)

Is she pretty?

VOICE
Hard to say. On the telephone, she
has a gentle voice.

DEL RIO
A-ha! I'll take the call.

VOICE
Shall I tape it?

DEL RIO
Yes.

VOICE

Putting her through.
75.

DEL RIO
Okay... Hello?

Lucy
Hello. I have important information
about a gang of drug traffickers.
I'd like to speak to someone ina
position of authority.

Pierre shrugs. Chances are, this is a hoax.

DEL RIO
(laughs)
Okay, you have great timing.
There's nobody in this office with
more authority than me. But let's
start at the beginning. What's your
name, young lady?

Lucy strides through the terminal building.

Lucy
Lucy.

DEL RIO
(smiles)
Really? Lucy's a pretty name. And
quite rare for an American, I
believe. To be called Lucy. But it's
very common in France. How did
that happen?

Lucy is in no mood for games. She stops in the middle of the
concourse and closes her eyes to gather her concentration.

INSERT:

A huge "30%" fills the screen.
76.

The view enters the receiver, zips across the circuit boards,
then shoots up at the speed of light, through the airport roof
and out of the satellite dish.

With a bright flash, the view bounces off an orbiting satellite
and zings back to earth, France. Del Rio's of fice, His telephone.

Freeze-frame.

The view pans around the office.
The nameplate “Pierre Del Rio” on the desk. Unruly piles of
paperwork. A red pen.

Back on Lucy. She sighs.

Lucy
Listen up, Pierre Del Riol First, sit
down properly at that desk of
yours, pick up the red pen to the
right of you and take down
everything I say.

Pierre freezes.

He glances around as if expecting to find a hidden camera
filming him.

Lucy starts moving again, headed for Customs.
Lucy (CONT'D)
There are no cameras, Pierre.
Hurry up, I have no time to waste.
Del Rio is shocked.

His buddies are too busy cracking jokes to notice anything.
He walks around his desk and sits down. Picks up the red pen.
77.

DEL RIO
Go ahead,

Lucy
I'm going to send you the details of
four people about to arrive on
European soil. Each one is carrying a
kilo of a new and extremely
dangerous drug. You must arrest
them, and find and destroy the
drugs.

Pierre takes notes.
Lucy hands her passport to the Customs Officer.
Asniffer dog ambles over.

DEL RIO
Okay... What form are the drugs in?
Bars? Capsules?

Lucy
Powder. In plastic packets hidden in
their intestines. Make sure they
don't split open when you take them
out.

DEL RIO
Pardon me?

Lucy lowers her dark glasses.

The dog recoils, its tail between its legs.
Lucy nudges her glasses back up her nose.

Lucy
The product is very powerful.
Believe me.

Del Rio's police computer cranks into action without him touching
it. The resumés of the four mules flash up on screen.

LUcy (CONT'D)
Got it?
DEL RIO
(confused)
Yes.
Lucy
Good.

Lucy hangs up. Del Rio is stunned.

INT. PARIS AIRPORT - DAY 39

LOUIS BERTRAND, one of the young mules we saw in Taipei, is
also coming through Customs.

Up ahead, Capt. Pierre Del Rio nods to the Customs Officials,
who immediately pull over the mule. Louis acts surprised, but he
is shaking guiltily.

Not far away, two Chinese guys watch their merchandise is
taken from under their noses.

INT. BERLIN AIRPORT - DAY 40

Ateam from the Anti-Drogen-Gruppe arrests another of the

The Italian mule comes through Customs, but is hauled over by
two Carabinieri. He shows them his passport and, suddenly,
makes a run for it.

His escape bid is cut short by the numerous plain-clothes
officers in the terminal building.

MARCO, head of the narcotics unit, yells orders to his men and
pulls out his cellphone.

INT. PARIS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY 43
The place is buzzing. Del Rio answers the phone.

DEL RIO
Del Rio.

MARCO
(Italian accent)
This is Captain Marco Lurhesi.

DEL RIO
Yes! Thanks for calling me back.

MARCO
We took delivery of your package.
Two hours late, but it got here in
the end.

DEL RIO
Great! Thanks very much. I'll send
through the paperwork for the
transfer.

Pierre hangs up and grins.

DEL RIO (CONT'D)

We got all four of them.

INT. PLANE - DAY 44
The Fasten seat be/ts sign comes on.
A message crackles over the loudspeakers.

VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now
beginning our descent to Paris. All
electronic devices must be
switched off...

AFLIGHT ATTENDANT with her smile as firmly in place as
her hair walks up the first-class aisle checking people have
belted up.

She stops beside Lucy, who has two laptops in front of her and
types on both at the same time.

The Flight Attendant pauses.

She's seen some financial whizkids on this flight, but none like
this one.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Miss, T have to ask you to put away
your computers now.
81.

Lucy is engrossed in the thousands of items of coded
information scrolling past her eyes. It's illegible for any normal
human being.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
Miss?

Lucy
(riveted to the screen)
You should wipe your nose.

The Flight Attendant doesn't understand.

A drop of blood appears in one nostril.
The woman touches her nose and realizes she's bleeding.

Slightly flustered, she scurries away. Lucy keeps working.

Up ahead, in the galley, the Flight Attendant talks animatedly
to her co-workers, Points toward Lucy.

The CABIN MANAGER decides to take matters in hand and
comes over.

CABIN MANAGER
(politely)
Miss, you really need to shut down
your computers now.

Lucy puts her finger to her mouth, hushing him.

On her screens, Lucy finally reaches the end of the coded signs,
gives a little satisfied sigh and gently closes both laptops.

Lucy
(big smile)
Twenty-five centuries of
knowledge in eleven hours. I
couldn't go any faster.
82.

The Cabin Manager smiles uncomprehendingly.

CABIN MANAGER
Congratulations.

Lucy
Thanks, I think I'll have a glass of
champagne to celebrate.

CABIN MANAGER
Coming right up. If you could put
your table up in the meantime...?

Lucy
With pleasure.

Lucy casually tosses the laptops on the floor. The Businessman
next to her looks appalled.

Lucy peers out the window at the French countryside below.

The moon is still partially visible in the blue sky.
An awed smile flickers on Lucy's lips.

INSERT:

Prehistoric Lucy breaks into the same awed smile.

She's sitting on a rock, at the entrance to her cave, observing
the moon.

BACK TO SCENE:

The Cabin Manager brings Lucy her champagne.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Thank you.

He walks away. Lucy raises her glass ina silent toast. All alone.
83.
INSERT:

A huge "40%" fills the screen.

Lucy downs the champagne in one. Heaves a sigh.

There's something in her glass.
She peers into it and sees she has lost a tooth.

Lucy looks alarmed. She gives a little cough and spits into her
hand. Three more teeth nestle in her palm.
Lucy feels panic overwhelming her.

She stares at her hands.
The veins are enormous, pulsating in sync with her heart.

She touches the backs of her hands,

The skin comes away, revealing the veins and flesh.

Soon her fingertips disintegrate as if each cell is now
independent, like a pear! necklace after the chain breaks.
Lucy's fingers morph into thousands of little balls floating in
front of her. Lucy is horrified.

She scrambles to unbuckle her seat belt, hauls herself up and
staggers to the restroom.

The Cabin Manager sees her.

CABIN MANAGER
Miss! You must remain seated!
Please --

He suddenly realizes that Lucy's body is falling to pieces!
Before he can say or do anything, Lucy raises her hand, and the
vibrations from it are enough to send him flying ten meters
back .

Lucy locks herself in the restroom.

84,
INT. RESTROOM 45

Lucy can barely control her body. Each cell seems to have a life
of its own. Her hands and hair are out of control. Even her eyes
start wandering across her face.

She can't keep her mouth in place.

Lucy tries the best she can to gather all the cells escaping
from her, To no avail. In fact, it only gets worse.

Panic-stricken, Lucy starts screaming from her big deformed
mouth.

Suddenly, without warning, Lucy's whole body explodes into
thousands of tiny balls, which bounce of f the walls of the room,
like a swarm of bees that has gone mad.

BLACKOUT.

CLOSE ona man’s hand flicking through a passport.
He stops at the page with Lucy's photo on it.

DEL RIO
(under his breath)
Lucy.
(to an officer)
How much of the drug was she
carrying?

OFFICER
An open pouch. About 700 grams.

The OFFICER holds out a ziplock bag with about fifty grams
inside. Intrigued, Del Rio peers at the substance.
47

85.
He turns to a DOCTOR.

DEL RIO
Did she have a scar on her lower
stomach?

DOCTOR
Yes. A fresh one. She still had the
stitches.

DEL RIO
She's our girl! How is she?

DOCTOR
Fine for now. She's sleeping and
after the shot I gave her, she won't
be waking up any time soon.

INT. AIRPORT MEDICAL FACILITY - DAY 47

One eye flits open. The iris changes rapidly several times, like
a kaleidoscope.

INSERT:
A huge "60%" fills the screen.

Lucy sits up and scans the room around her. Lucy lies ona
gurney. She has a drip attached to her arm.

She looks in pretty good shape for someone who's just
swallowed her second A-bomb.

Lucy reaches up to touch her forehead, but handcuffs restrain
her. She is cuffed to the steel frame.

ANURSE enters and stops in her tracks, amazed to see that
Lucy is awake. She rushes out again.

And I need you to put your hands up.

Lucy stares at him without emotion, She halfheartedly raises
‘one hand and, suddenly, the two dozen cops in the hallway
collapse as if someone had simply switched them off.

Del Rio stands there alone with his pathetic pea-shooter. As she
‘begins to walk towards him. Del Rio is stunned. But he still
doesn't lower his gun. Until she is six inches in front of him.

Lucy
Did you get the other packets?
DEL RIO
' Yes.
Lucy

\ Where are they?

88.

DEL RIO
Safe. Here in Paris.

Lucy
You need to destroy it all fast.

DEL RIO
Unfortunately, that's out of my
hands. I don't have the power to
make decisions like that.

Lucy
I do.

EXT. HOSPITAL, PARTS - DAY 50
‘A police van swings into the courtyard.

‘The four handcuffed mules are ushered out.

Acar pulls up outside, occupied by four Chinese guys.

‘One of them, TSUL, observes events in the courtyard.

The mules are led inside one wing of the hospital.

‘Tsui dials a number and starts to talk.

INT. CAR, PARTS - DAY 51

Del Rio drives an unmarked car with a magnetic blue light on the
“roof.

Lucy sits next to him and watches Paris flash by.

DEL RIO
I'm a bit confused by all this.
89.

Lucy
Not as muchas I am.

DEL RIO
(softly)
May I ask what happened to you?

LUCY
I'm in the process of becoming
intelligent.

DEL RIO
Sounds like a good thing to me.

Lucy
It's the most horrible thing that's
ever happened to me! It's like
becoming an adult and leaving
childhood behind.

DEL RIO
(to make conversation)
My childhood was pretty
complicated. I joined the police
department when I was 18 to
escape all that. So I was actually
quite pleased to become an adult.

Lucy
You're not.

DEL RIO
Not what?

Lucy
An adult. You're a baby. As fragile
as humanity.
90.

DEL RIO
(smirks)
Really? Humanity's fragile?

Lucy
(stares out the window)
As fragile as a bubble of soap.

Del Rio stops at a red light.

| Lucy glances at a man on the phone.
‘She automatically visualizes the signal he's receiving--a beam of
‘green light connecting his phone to a satellite in the sky.

| She looks at the street up ahead. Thousands of beams of green
‘light interweave. She can simultaneously see every telephone

| signal.

|

| Suddenly, one in particular catches her attention.
‘Tt's a beam of red light.

Lucy is focused on the telephone signals. She begins to organize
all the beams using the window like the screen of an iPad until

_ she finds the red beam. Closing in on it, the red beam appears

' to be made up of Chinese characters.

LUCY (CONT'D)
May I?

|
| She scans the radio for a particular frequency.

DEL RIO
Be my guest.

Suddenly, a conversation in Chinese echoes around the car.
|

|
DEL RIO (CONT'D)
What's that?
52

91.

Lucy
We're going to get there too late. I
should drive.

DEL RIO
That's not possible. This is an
official vehicle and we can't...

‘Lucy has already jumped out and raced around to the driver's
side.

|Hurriedly, Del Rio shuffles over to avoid being sat on by Lucy.

DEL RIO (CONT'D)
Okay, okay!

The car screeches away.

INT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - DAY 52
| The four handcuffed mules sit in a waiting room.

| Two cops fill out the paperwork.

The GERMAN mule is more on-edge than the others.

GERMAN
(to the cop)
Look, I'm a German citizen and I
demand to see a lawyer. It's my
right!

ROBERT THE COP
(seen it all before)
First, you're gonna see a doctor.
Believe me, it'll be way better for
your health.
(to his buddy)
(MORE)
53

92.
ROBERT THE COP (CONT'D)
I'm gonna see where we gotta take
them for surgery.
CoP #2
Grab something for us to eat, I'm
starving.
ROBERT THE COP
Eating, that's all you ever think
about!
Robert exits and heads down the hallway.

iA cop standing guard watches him go. When the cop glances the

jother way, he finds himself eye to eye with the silencer of
‘Tsui's gun.

‘Another Chinese guy immediately disarms the sentry and
|hustles him into the waiting room.

‘Before the two cops can react, they're dead.

‘Asmall group of Chinese guys carrying attaché cases enter the
‘waiting room, shutting the door behind them.

The empty hallway falls silent once more...

‘EXT. STREET, PARIS - DAY 53

.. In complete contrast to Lucy gunning the car through the
streets of Paris.

Del Rio clings to the overhead handle.
'He had no idea you could get such speed out of a police car.

Lucy is calm and focused.
54

93.
‘She totally ignores red lights, yield signs, etc.

DEL RIO
(petrified)
Do you always drive like this?

Lucy
Tt‘s the first time I've ever driven
acar. I don't like them. They
pollute the atmosphere.

DEL RIO

Yes, but if you drive slower, they
pollute less.

|Lucy doesn't answer and slaloms at top speed between two cars
‘waiting at a stop light.
INT. WAITING ROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY 54
The Chinese guys hold guns on three of the mules.
|The last one, the German mule, is on the table.
'ACHINESE DOCTOR is poised to open him up.
GERMAN
Wait! Wait! My stomach is
extremely sensitive!
DOCTOR
T gave you a local anesthetic. You
won't feel a thing.
GERMAN

T will! I feel the tiniest little thing!
I need a general anesthetic, Please!
55

56

94.

TSUL
As you wish.

Tsui steps forward and, with the silencer on, shoots him
between the eyes.

‘The three other mules are on the verge of meltdown.

‘The Dutch guy begins to sob.

‘EXT. CAR - DAY 55

Del Rio's car screeches to a halt outside the hospital.

‘Lucy and Del Rio jump out.

DEL RIO
This way!

‘INT. WALTING ROOM, HOSPITAL - DAY

56

The Chinese Doctor carefully pulls a pouch from the Dutch guy's
gut. The mule is panting and snorting, staring at the ceiling.

The Doctor places the pouch in an attaché case next to two
other pouches.

' An assistant is already busy sewing up the Dutch mule.

TSUI
(to the Italian)
Okay, your turn.

| Just then, Robert the Cop enters, witha bunch of plastic-
wrapped sandwiches in his hands.

ROBERT THE COP
T got us -
95.

He stops in his tracks, gawking at the scene of butchery in the
waiting room.

|He drops the food and reaches for his gun, but the Chinese beat
“him to the draw and riddle him with bullets.

|The Dutch guy yells out, and takes a bullet in the shoulder,
As usual, the Italian takes his chance to bolt for freedom.

A Chinese guy races after him and shoots the Italian in the
back. The dead mule slides across the floor and stops at Lucy's
feet.

Del Rio ducks for cover and pulls his gun out.
|
Lucy just stands there, with the Italian at her feet.
The Chinese guy doesn't shoot. He gazes at her. And collapses.

|
From inside the room, Tsui sees the goon collapse.

| He closes up the attaché case with the dope in it, and draws his
| gun.

| Adozen Chinese gangsters swarm into the hallway, leveling
their guns at Lucy.

INSERT:
| A huge “70%" fills the screen.
She raises her hand slightly.

All the goons’ guns suddenly fly up and stick to the ceiling.
| The Chinese mobsters are dumbstruck. Their guns melt and
become blackish puddles stuck to the ceiling.
96.

LUcy
(to Tsui)
It's time for you to choose: Learn
' or die.
|
‘Tsui hesitates and then... screams!

‘His goons attack. Lucy dodges every blow and attack with
‘precision and calm.

None of them even slows her down.

Soon, the dozen gangsters are sprawled on the floor and Lucy
_stands facing Tsui, who charges at her.

‘He aims a punch at Lucy, who ducks it.

| She grabs his outstretched hand and shoves him brutally

| backwards. Tsui’s arm dislocates, popping grotesquely out of his
| shoulder.

_ Tsui screams in pain. Lucy takes the case from his grasp.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Dying hurts but not as much as
| learning.

Tsui collapses in an unconscious heap.

_ Lucy comes back to Del Rio, who has stuck close to the Italian
| mule.

_ The poor cop looks totally confused.
Lucy hands him the case.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Open it.
97.
| She hunches over the inert Italian and delves into the wound in
his belly with her nail, which has suddenly become long and
‘sharp. She pulls out a packet full of C.P.H.4.

Lucy slips the packet into the case with the three other
packets.

LUCY (CONT'D)
The full set. Let's go.

She closes the case and picks it up.

DEL RIO
I... I'm not sure I'll be much use to
you!
Lucy
Yes, you are.
DEL RIO
What for exactly?
Lucy

To keep my humanity alive.

Lucy looks at him, then leans forward and tenderly kisses him.

Beat.

LUCY (CONT'D)
(so sweet)
How was it?

DEL RIO
Not bad. And for you?
57

98.

Lucy
I can't feel a thing. Except that you
really wanted that.
Shall we go?

‘With nothing better to offer, Del Rio just nods.

EXT. UNIVERSITY, PARIS - DAY 57
A group of scientists sits in a large room piled high with books.

‘Professor Norman is in animated conversation with a colleague
when his mobile rings.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Hello?

Lucy (0.S.)
Lucy.

‘Norman gestures excitedly to his colleagues.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(his hand over the
receiver)
It's her! It's her!
(to Lucy)
You... You're in Paris?

Lucy (0.5.)
Yes. I was a little delayed. Please
forgive me.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
No, no! No problem! Look, I'm not at

the hotel.
(MORE)
99.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
I'm at the University, where I took
the liberty of calling together a
few colleagues to discuss your case.
Top men in the field. Completely
trustworthy.

Lucy (0.S.)
Good thinking.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Do you... Do you think you could join
us here at the University?

LUCY (0.S.)
With pleasure.

Just then, the door opens and Lucy enters.
Norman stares at her in awe. She hands Del Rio his phone.
' The cop is carrying the attaché case.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(mesmerized)
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Lucy
Likewise.
(motions to Del Rio)
Pierre Del Rio, my lover.

Now Del Rio blushes.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Oh? Nice to meet you. Let me
introduce my colleagues. First,
Professor Cantié, a neurosurgeon
who --
Lucy
I know everybody.

Lucy has no time to lose.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Oh, yes. Of course! Gentlemen, this
is Lucy, the first woman to... I
mean...

Aconfused murmur from his colleagues.

PROFESSOR NORMAN (CONT'D)
(to the scientists)
As I mentioned earlier, Miss Lucy,
for reasons that remain a mystery
to me, has unlocked certain parts of
her brain, offering her access,
apparently, to previously unexplored
cerebral zones.

Silence. The scientists are perplexed.

PROFESSOR #1
You have access to your RAM or to
your hard drive? Or both?

LUCY
All three. You're forgetting
collective memory.

PROFESSOR #1
(skeptical)
Can you give us a sample?

_ Lucy looks at the Professor and materializes all the vibrations
| coming from him. She connects up to them.
101.

LUcy
Your daughter Gabrielle died aged
6, run over by a car.

INSERT:

A dog runs across the road, followed by a little girl.
‘The car has no chance of avoiding her.

BACK TO SCENE:

Professor ROBERT DAGUAN tears up.
He stares incredulously at Lucy.

LUcy (CONT'D)
It was a blue car. Leather seats, a
plastic bird dangling from the rear-
view. Do you want the plate
number?

'Daguan shakes his head. He's devastated.

Lucy hardly seems affected.

PROFESSOR #3
i How did you manage to access all
: this information?

LUCy
Electrical impulses. Each cell in the
body emits a thousand per second.

| She raises her hand and makes her fingers stretch until they
‘are improbably long.

| Her hand switches to three fingers, like a batrachian--a
remnant of bygone DNA.

The scientists are speechless.
102.

PROFESSOR #3
And you can control them all? In
anyone you meet?

Lucy
No, but I'm getting better. Every
door that opens releases knowledge
that allows me to open the next one.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(remembers the lesson)
Like dominoes.

PROFESSOR #2
And... What stage are you at now?

Lucy
I can control matter... Ona small
scale.

Lucy makes a sculpture on the table rise and hover in front of
“her. The sculpture begins to change, morphing into all kinds of
weird and wonderful shapes.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(to himself)
Breathtaking!

Lucy
Yes, but I have to devote a lot of
my energy to slowing it all down.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Why slow it down?
| Lucy
To protect the humanity within me.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to
communicate with you anymore, just
like you can no longer communicate
with plants or animals. The gap is
too wide.

The professors are speechless, Del Rio is lost.

LUCY (CONT'D)
All social systems that we have put
in place are a mere sketch, a child's
drawing. "One plus one makes two.”
That's all we've learned.
In other words, nothing! Because
one plus one has never made two.
There are in fact no numbers and no
letters. All that's just prehistoric
grunting. We have codified our
existence to bring it down to human
size, to make it bearable. We have
' found a scale to make us forget its
unfathomable scale.
/ Because we don't fear what we
don't know.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(realizes)
Are you saying that “Fear" stops us
from going further?

Lucy
Yes, it's a self-defense mechanism.

Lucy watch a screen, and images of a foetus growing appears.
104.

LUCY (CONT'D)
Only the fetus is devoid of fear.
It modifies its cells, manufactures
its bones, blood and tissue. It's
working on a titanic construction
site that it manipulates without
moving, without even existing.
Devoid of fear. Then, from the
moment of birth, the human being
closes the doors to knowledge one
by one, for self-protection.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(nods)
Like a frightened horse who can
only walk with blinders on its eyes.

Lucy
Forget fear and you will have
unlimited access to all things, for
every cell knows and talks to every
other cell. They form a gigantic web
of communication, which in turn
forms matter. Cells group together,
taking one form, deforming,
reforming... makes no difference.
Humans consider themselves
“unique,” so they have rooted the
whole theory of their existence in
this uniqueness. Their whole world
and their mathematical languages
are a function of themselves. "One"
is their unit of measure. But it's
not. Life doesn't like uniqueness.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
But if humans are not the unit of
measure, if the world isn't
governed by mathematical laws,
what governs all that?
|
Lucy takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out.
‘The truth isn't always easy to say.

Lucy
Film a car driving past on a highway.
Speed up the picture to infinity and
eventually the car will disappear.
What proof of its existence
remains? Time gives legitimacy to
its existence, Time, the only unit
of measure. It is the proof of the
existence of matter. Without time,
we don't exist.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(fascinated; to himself)
Time is unity.

Lucy
Every single thing dematerializes
then connects back up, forming a
whole. Single, indivisible and
eternal.

105.

| The scientists are in shock. Torn between bewilderment and

fascination. Between the real and the divine.

PROFESSOR DAGUAN
And God in all of this?

Lucy
(sadly)
When one doesn't know, it's
reassuring to imagine that
somebody somewhere knows.

_ Awkward silence.
106.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Lucy... What do you intend to do
with all this knowledge?
LUcy
Pass it on . Like a humble cell that
would strive to keep going through
time.
Norman smiles, delighted to have been heard.
Del Rio looks at Lucy.
His cop instinct tells him he's about to lose her.
INSERT:

A huge "90%" fills the screen.

59 INT. LABORATORY - DAY 59
The scientists are in a University lab.

Del Rio dissolves the contents of the last packet of CP.H.4. ina
_pouch of physiological serum. The four pouches are hooked up to
‘drips connected to Lucy's arms.

The scientists place sensors all over her body and activate a
swathe of monitors and apparatuses.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(slightly harassed)
Okay, we're ready, I think.

Lucy
Good.
107.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(anxious)
Are you sure you still need such
huge doses? You said that the doors
to knowledge were opening one
after the other.

Lucy
The humanity inside me will resist
and defend my body to the very
end. To attain the last few percent,
T have to force it--crack cells open
to their nucleus.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Oh? And then?

LUCy
Then I'll stock pile all my
knowledge. Most likely it'll take you
a few decades to decipher it all.
It'll keep you busy.

The Professor smiles. But he soon becomes serious again.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
Lucy... All this knowledge... It will be
awonderful gift that you are giving
humanity.

LUCY
Knowledge brings peace. Make sure
it belongs to the whole world.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
(awkwardly)
I'll try. I'm not sure those who
govern us will put it to good use or
resist the lure of profit.
108.

LUcy
(amused)
T'll put it all away ina safe place.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
That sounds sensible but, in that
case, how will I ever know where
you've stored it all?

LUcy
T'll let you know.

They share a smile.

PROFESSOR NORMAN
I know this probably doesn't mean
much to you anymore but... You're a
beautiful person, Lucy, and it’s been
a pleasure getting to know you.

Lucy
Thank you.

Del Rio shyly comes over to Lucy

DEL RIO
(murmurs)
Are you sure you know what you're
doing?

Lucy
(smiles)
Yes.

DEL RIO
Can I do anything to help?
109.

Lucy
No.
(beat)
But, yes, you can kiss me.

‘And he does. He kisses her withall his heart.

DEL RIO
(moved)
If I heard you correctly earlier, we're
gonna see each other again?

Lucy half-smiles.

LUcy
Actually, we're inseparable.

Del Rio stands back and, one by one, Professor Norman opens up
the four drips. The substance in the pouches begins to flow into
Lucy's veins.

The scientists activate their apparatuses and cameras.
Standing by the wall, Del Rio fears the worst.

The substance seems to be taking effect. Lucy trembles
slightly, her face is gaunt and her pupils disappear.

Her arm stretches out to the keyboards of the computers. Her
hands sprout a couple dozen extra fingers, which spread out
“over the keyboards. The fingertips melt into the matter.

Reams of data flash up on every monitor in the room. Cables
emerge from the floor and ceiling like lazy snakes meandering
| toward Lucy and connecting to her.

The scientists are both mesmerized and a little concerned as
| their machines begin to overheat.
110.
|

‘Suddenly, the walls of the room shoot back 100 meters! The floor
gleams. Lucy redefines the room to her scale. The lab is now vast,
sparkling, medical almost.

‘Shapes as black as night emerge from the floor. They look like
‘carbon needles, black stalagmites several meters high. Thousands
of diodes flicker, These are next-generation computers -- that we
‘might be inventing one hundred years from now.

‘The assembled Professors watch in awe.

Lucy half-smiles, while her heartbeat seems to slow gradually.
When the vaive of her heart finally blows (with a deafening noise),
Lucy springs forward a kilometer or so. She is now in the city

center, but still in her chair.

Another clap of her heart and she springs 1,000 kilometers. She's
in Rome now.

‘Another clap and she's in New York.

Suddenly, her heart stops. The picture likewise. Lucy reaches out
and turns an imaginary page. The picture slides to the left, a bit

‘like an iPad window. The next image is the same but ona slightly
different timescale.

Lucy turns more pages, generating movement before her very

eyes, like a children's book whose characters are animated when

the pages are turned quickly.

Lucy's face lights up. She now has control of time.

With a big sweep of her arm, she makes images flash past. New

York's skyscrapers disappear and the city reverts to how it was in

1900, with people's clothes and carriages from another age.

'- Lucy flicks quickly through the pages again.
111.

New York is now no more than a swamp, home to a few Indians.

- Another leap in time and there are only dinosaurs paddling
through the marches.

- Another leap and we are seeing primeval forest with totally
unfamiliar vegetation.

Lucy takes a deep breath and gives another broad sweep of her
‘arm. Everything suddenly accelerates: the Cambrian period and its
[torrential million-year rains passes ina few seconds. The Earth is
‘no more than a volcano floating away in space.

Lucy is fascinated by everything she sees at each stage. The
Earth joins thousands of other stars in movement.

The journey in time takes us back to the origins.

Tunnels of stars, sidereal paintings that look like the accumulation
of cells we saw right at the start of the movie.

- Millions of stars fizz past, all in the same direction.
- The cells are now visible. There are around a hundred of them.
- The stars gather and converge ona single point.
- Only eight cells now.
| - The energy of the universe is concentrated and condensed.
- Only four cells now.

_- All the stars hurtle toward a single point. The energy is
_ unbearable.

| - Two cells.

- The whole Universe is now a phosphorescent ball.
112.

L There is now... only one single cell, a single planet, a single iris, a
single world, A same circle with different colors.

- The Universe continues to shrink and disappears into a miniscule
circle. An iris. A cell.

Lucy is at the origin of the world, a spectator of the Big Bang.
- BLACKOUT -

- For several seconds, we remain in darkness, sidereal night. No
\picture or sound, just emptiness.

- Lucy weeps tears of joy and grief. Ultimate knowledge
necessarily provokes both.

- CLOSE on Lucy's heart. The enormous valve is about to close
again, like the massive door of a fortified castle.

_~ In slow-motion, the valve slams deafeningly shut on the ventricle.
Her heart is about to beat again. With the next clap, the Universe
explodes once more, and her heart swells once more.

- At top speed, we rewind the story, or fast-forward it, no
matter...

The original explosion, expansion of the Universe, formation of the
Earth, its oceans, the inception of life, civilization...

Ts the Universe perpetual motion? As regular as a heartbeat?
The history of a lifetime fits into a single heartbeat?

. Life stories and the history of the Universe are a single story
_ seen from agreater or smaller distance?

| And time is just a scale to measure the size of the story?
i cur TO:
113.

The camera hurtles at top speed through periods and plains
toward Lucy, sitting on her chair in the middle of the lab.

The camera arrives so fast, like a car speeding into a wall, and the
impact is so violent that Lucy disappears.

Her clothes fall on the floor. She is nowhere and, most likely,
everywhere.

|
|She is now part of the Universe, part of this never-ending story
[that constantly lives and dies, like a simple cell.

INSERT:
Ahuge "100%" fills the screen.
‘The scientists gawk, slack-jawed. They can't believe their eyes.

Del Rio is baffled, Silence settles on the room. Even the
computers fall silent.

Everybody stares at the inanimate clothes on the floor, the only
‘trace of Lucy's passage.

The silence becomes oppressive.

_ Suddenly, Professor Norman's phone rings, startling everybody
in the room, He pulls it out of his pocket.

It's not a call, just a text. Signed “Lucy.”
It reads:
It's on Youtube.

| The Professor smiles, enthralled by this proof of his
| hypothesis.
