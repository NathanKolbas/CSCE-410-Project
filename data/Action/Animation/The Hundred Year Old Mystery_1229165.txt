Edmund looks out the window. A SPITFIRE swoops in.

Suddenly, FLAME SHOOTS FROM ONE OF THE BOMBERS. It wobbles
in the air... .

sky...DIRECTLY AT HIM.

He stands frozen...
THE PLANE SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

Come on, Lucy. No time for
daydreaming.

She pulls Lucy on her way.

A TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS.

HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN say goodbye to their families on the
platform. Bags and prized belongings lie stacked all around.

PAN DOWN TO A POSTER of a DESTITUTE FAMILY: “HELP THE CITY
CHILDREN. HOUSING EVACUEES IS A NATIONAL SERVICE!”

Lucy stares glumly up at the poster as
HER MOTHER PINS HER NAME AND DESTINATION TO HER COAT.

Wearing a WVS UNIFORM, Mrs. Pevensie takes a long, sad look
at her children. She pins a label to Edmund’s coat.

MRS. PEVENSIE
You will be good... Won't you,.Ed?

She tries to hug him, but Edmund turns away. She sadly
settles for kissing his cheek.

She hands Peter A SHEAF OF DOCUMENTS.

MRS. PEVENSIE (cont'd)
It’s not for very long.
(she hugs him)
Promise me you'll look after the
others.

Lucy reaches up and takes Peter's hand. Peter looks down at
it, forcing an uneasy smile.

PETER
I will, mum.

Mrs. Pevensie hugs the other children goodbye. Edmund
refuses to meet her eye, stifling a tear.

Peter leads the children to the train. Confused, he sifts
through the documents his mother gave him.

Susan rolls her eyes and takes the papers from him.

Edmund tries to glimpse his mother in the crowd. Suddenly,
HE BOLTS.

SUSAN
Edmund!

EDMUND DASHES PAST THE GUARD and into his mother’s arms.

He gives her A TIGHT SQUEEZE, then scampers onto the train.
MOMENTS LATER:

A whistle screams as the train eases out of the station.

The Pevensies join the rest of the children, leaning out the
windows, shouting good-bye.

Mrs. Pevensie cries openly, watching them pull away.

LUCY'S FEET-do not quite reach the floor. Peter takes a

Edmund watches from the window as two children are collected
by SOMBER FOSTER PARENTS. He swallows, worried.

EXT. RURAL RAILWAY STATION - DAY 12

The train pulls away, leaving the Pevensies on an empty
platform.

A sign on the ticket booth creaks in the wind.

LUCY
Shouldn’t someone be here for us?

Edmund eyes his nametag.

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 5.

EDMUND
Perhaps we've been incorrectly
labeled.

LUCY

Maybe he's forgotten us.
Suddenly, AN ANCIENT BLACK BUGGY CLATTERS UP.

EDMUND
I wish he had.

A STERN WOMAN peers down from the seat, none too impressed.

MRS, MACREADY
Pevensies?

PETER
Yes, ma‘am.

MRS. MACREADY
I’m Mrs. Macready, the Professor’s
housekeeper. Load your things.
Quickly, we're on a schedule.
EXT. PROFESSOR‘S HOUSE ~ DUSK 13

THE PROFESSOR’S HOUSE looms through the trees, three stories
of stone and stained glass.

The children stare up fromthe vattling buggy.
MRS .° MACREADY
I*‘hope you all appreciate that this
house is of great historic value.
People come from all over England
to view it.
The buggy turns onto the tree-lined drive.

SUSAN
Really? Why?

MRS. MACREADY
It is in all the guide books.
INT. PROFESSOR’S HOUSE - DUSK 14

A GNARLED CLAW digs its sharp talons into a wooden sphere.

MRS. MACREADY
There will be no shouting or
running. No sliding on the
banisters. No improper use of the
dumb-waiter. :

Edmund reaches out to touch a gleaming SUIT OF ARMOR. Mrs.
Macready smacks his hand away.

MRS. MACREADY (cont'd)
No touching of the historical
artifacts. And above all...
They stop by A CLOSED DOOR. Light flickers behind it.
MRS. MACREADY (cont’d)
There will be no disturbing the
Professor.

Peter, Susan and Edmund follow Mrs. Macready down the hall.
Lucy lingers behind.

Suddenly, A SHADOW MOVES UNDER THE DOOR. Lucy dashes. away.

INT. PROFESSOR’ Ss HQUSE, GIRLS’ BEDROOM — NIGHT ‘ 15

 

Lucy ies under the, covers, a tiny girl in a large bed.

 

 

LUCY
this bed’ s too big.

Peter ruffles her hair.

PETER
You sure you haven‘t shrunk?

Lucy smiles despite herself. In the next bed, Susan tucks
herself in.

SUSAN
The Professor's just not used to
having kids around.

Lucy hugs her pillow.

LUCY
I still miss Mum,

EDMUND ENTERS, carrying a plate.

EDMUND
Well, if you’re homesick, go stand
outside the Macready’s door. She
snores like an air raid siren.

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 7.

Lucy giggles as Edmund puts down a PLATE OF BISCUITS.

EDMUND (cont‘d)
That pantry’s a gold mine.

SUSAN
You should be in bed.

EDMUND
Stop trying to sound like Mum. Go
to bed yourself.

SUSAN
T am in bed.

Defeated, Edmund scowls at her.
Peter takes a biscuit and gives it to Lucy.
PETER

Tell you what. Tomorrow, we'll go

outside and explore. You saw the

grounds. There’s no telling what

we'll find.
Lucy tries to smile.

; PETER (cont’d

'It’ll be great. I promise.

INT. PROFESSOR’S HOUSE, “SITTING ROOM - DAY 16
Lucy stares sadly as RAIN PELTS DOWN on the leaded window.

SUSAN (0.8.)
GASTROVASCULAR.

Susan stands at a table before a HUGE DICTIONARY.

SUSAN (cont'd)
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

Peter slumps in a chair, incredibly bored.

PETER
Is it Latin?

SUSAN
Yes.

Edmund's legs stick out from under a coffee table.
EDMUND (0.S.)

Is it Latin for “worst game ever
invented”?
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 8.

—_

Susan shuts the dictionary with a loud thump. Lucy turns
from the window.

Lucy
What about hide and seek?

Peter makes a pained face.

PETER

Oh, come on. Anything but.
LUCY

Please?
EDMUND

(from under the table)
It is a good house for it.

Thunder rumbles in the distance.

SUSAN
Give up, Peter. We're certainly
not going outside.

PETER |
Count me out. I mean it. Nota
chance. = :

Peter leans against the wall, eyes shut, annoyed.

.. PEPER
Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen.

Lucy dashes round a corner, in time to see...Susan lowering
herself into the WINDOW SEAT, her finger to her lips.

PETER (0.S.) (cont'd)
Thirty. Thirty-one.

Lucy jumps behind a potted fern, but she shows right through.

PETER (0.S.) (cont'd)
Fifty-six. Fifty-seven.

Lucy yanks back a velvet curtain to find...Edmund.

EDMUND
I was here first.

PETER (0.S.)

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 3

She careens around the maze-like hall to a CLOSED DOOR.

PETER (0.S.) (cont'd)
Ninety.

Lucy throws open the door and runs in.

INT. PROFESSOR‘'S HOUSE, WARDROBE ROOM —- DAY 18
Lucy shuts the door behind her, spins around and stops.

The room stands empty and quiet, almost forgotten.

She stares...A WARDROBE LOOMS AGAINST THE FAR WALL.

At the window, a fly buzzes loudly, then dies. Leaving
nothing but silence.

PETER (0.S.)
Ninety-four...

Lucy dashes to the wardrobe. She reaches up for the knob.
It sticks.

*PETER (0.S.)’ (cont'd)
Ninety-five...

Lucy pulls again and the door pops open. Two mothballs roll
out onto the’*floor. Inside, FUR COATS hang on a bar.

PETER (0.S.) (cont'd)
Ninety-six...

Lucy takes a’ breath and DIVES INSIDE THE WARDROBE, leaving
the door just slightly open.

INT. THE WARDROBE -— DAY 19
A sliver of light splits the darkness. Lucy peers through
the crack into the room. She backs into the coats. Layers

of fur surround her.

PETER (0.S.)
Ninety-seven...

She puts out her hand, feeling for the back of the wardrobe.
She pushes in.

LUCY
Ouch.

She pulls back her hand, then reaches out again, confused.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 1d.

She takes another step and hears...A CRUNCH.

She crunches forward. HER BREATH STEAMS. Slowly, the
darkness around her lifts.

Lucy stops. She stares, amazed...
AT A PINE CONE HANGING FROM A TREE BRANCH.

Snow falls all around her.

EXT. NARNIA, LANTERN WASTE ~ NIGHT 20

Lucy spins in a circle, palms held out to collect the
falling snowflakes.

She looks behind her. ‘The light from the Wardrobe Room still
shows through the crack in the door.

Lucy peers into the forest. A LIGHT filters through the
trees. She walks forward. The light gets brighter.

She steps into a clearing. And there stands...
A LAMP-POST.
Lucy stares up at the hissing flame.

Suddenly, FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH IN THE SNOW BEHIND. HER. She spins
around and peers into the forest. Nothing.

More footsteps. Lucy SCREAMS as she sees...

a FaUn. (X"iitw’s" upper BODY WITH HORNS AND GOAT LEGS). A red
scarf around his neck, he carries several parcels.

Startled, he drops his parcels.

MR. TUMNUS
OH!

Lucy ducks behind the lamp-post. They stare at each other,
equally afraid.

Then Lucy looks down, where a fallen package lies. She picks
it up and offers it to him.

LUCY
You dropped this...

The FAUN cautiously takes it from her, amazed.

MR. TUMNUS
What are you?
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. ll.

Lucy looks confused.

LUCY
English?

MR. TUMNUS
You’re not a...Daughter of Eve?

LUCY
My mum's name is Miriam.

MR. TUMNUS
Excuse my asking, but are
you...human?

Lucy nods and extends her hand.

LUCY
Of course. My name’s Lucy
Pevensie.

The faun stares at her hand for a moment, curious.

LUCY (cont’d)
You shake it.

4 MR. TUMNUS
why?
LUCY

Um...I don’t know. People doit
when they meet each other.

The faun shakes her hand.

MR. TUMNUS
Well then allow me to introduce

myself, Lucy Pevensie. My name’s
Tumnus.

LUCY
I wonder, Mr. Tumnus, could you
tell me where I am?
Tumnus looks at her, taken aback.

MR. TUMNUS
You don’t know?

She shakes her head.
Lucy

I came through the wardrobe in the
spare room.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 12.

MR. TUMNUS
War Drobe? Spare Oom? I’ve never
heard of those places, and I've
lived in Narnia my whole life.

LUCY
Narnia? What’s that?

MR. TUMNUS
Dear girl. This is Narnia. From
the lamp-post to the shores of the
Eastern Ocean, every stick and
stone you see...is Narnia.

Lucy gazes at the snow drifting in the soaring sky.

LUCY
It’s beautiful.

She looks at Tumnus.

LUCY (cont'd)
Is it real?

MR. TUMNUS
Real? Of. course, it's real. As
real as the nose on your face.

He tweaks her nose.

MR. TUMNUS.. (cont’d)
Which I mightyadd' is freezing.
Where are my manhers?.
(formal ly}
Ludy ‘Pevensie, from the Land of
Spare Oom, how would it be if you
came and had tea with me?

 

At first she grins...but then she looks back into the woods.

LUCY
Thank you very much, but I probably
should get back.

MR. TUMNUS
It’s just around the corner.
There'll be a roaring fire and
cakes and toast...and sardines.

She hesitates. Tumnus offers his arm.
MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
It's not every day I get to have
tea with a human.

Lucy smiles, wavering.

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 13.

LUCY
I suppose I could go for a little
while...
She takes his arm, grinning mischievously.
LUCY (cont'd)
If you have sardines.

EXT. NARNIA, TUMNUS HOUSE - NIGHT 21

A pair of footprints, faun and human, wind THROUGH THE
WOODS...DOWN A SLOPE...ACROSS A PLAIN...to where

Imcy and Tumnus make their way through A TALL ROCK CANYON.
He holds an umbrella to ward off the snow.

Tumnus leads Lucy to a LARGE ROCK.

MR. TUMNUS
And here we are.

Lucy looks confused, then sees A DOOR. She grins, charmed.
Tumnus opens the door and graciously waves Lucy inside.

She walks in. Tumnus follows, closing the door behind them.
STAY OUTSIDE, as from inside comes the sound of...THE DOOR
LOCKING.

INT. MISTER TUMNUS’ HOUSE - NIGHT 22
CLOSE ON: TUMNUS’ HAND AS HE TAKES THE KEY FROM THE LOCK.

LUCY SITS IN A COMFY CHAIR, HER FEET DANGLING a few inches
off the ground.

LUCY
Is it always so cold in Narnia?

Tumnus pours out tea before a snapping fire.

MR. TUMNUS
Only for the last hundred years.

He sits down across from her.

MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
We're having a bad winter.

Lucy looks around the little room. She reads the titles on
the bookshelf: “IS MAN A MYTH?,” “HUMANS: THE UNTOLD STORY.”
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 14.

MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
How’s your tea? It’s too warm,
isn’t it? Is that how humans like
it?

LUCY
We like it just the way you do.

MR. TUMNUS
Oh. Good.

Tumnus smiles, then catches sight of
A PAINTING OF A GRAY-HAIRED FAUN on the table next to him.

When Lucy bends over to pull up her sock, Tumnus LAYS THE
PAINTING FACE DOWN. He looks at Lucy, nervous.

MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
I don’t suppose you know any
Narnian lullabies?
Tumnus opens a box and produces...A STRANGE LITILE PAN PIPE.

LUCY
No.

He raises the flute to his lips.
ve MR. TUMNUS
Good, because this. probably won’t
sound anything like one.

Tumnus plays A LILTING MELODY. Lucy listens, staring into
the ‘fire, ‘sipping her tea.

She blinks, startled. IN THE FLAMES, she sees...A HERD OF
GALLOPING CENTAURS.

She starts. Tumnus smiles reassuringly and goes on playing.

Lucy peers back into the fire: NYMPHS dance in a clearing.
DWARFS feast at a table. A FLYING HORSE takes to the air.

fumnus watches as Lucy sinks into her chair, her EYELIDS
DROOPING. He plays on until she slumps, ASLEEP.

He stares at her innocent face. His eyes move slowly away,
down to the fire...AND THEN GO WIDE.

IN THE FLAMES, A MASSIVE LION ROARS.
Tumnus jumps back, shocked.

THE FIRE GOERS OUT.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 15.

Lucy’s eyes flutter open. She yawns.

LUCY
Goodness. I must've dozed off.

She looks up at the window. It’s dark outside.
LUCY (cont'd)
What time is it? I really should
be going.

MR. TUMNUS
It’s no good now you know.

Tumnus looks at her, trembling. He twists the flute in his
hands, his knuckles white.

LUCY
Mr. Tumnus. You're scaring me.

THE FLUTE SHATTERS IN HIS HANDS.

MR. TUMNUS
I’m such a terrible faun.

Lucy hops off her chair andurests a hand on his shoulder.
&  puey 2
Oh, no. You’re the nicest faun
I‘ve-ever met.

Tumnus stops. He smiles at her sadly.

MR. TUMNUS
I’m afraid you’ve had a very poor
sampling.

LUCY

But you’ve been nothing but lovely
to me. Whatever you've done, I'm
sure you're sorry.

MR, TUMNUS
It isn’t something I have done,
Lucy. It's something I am doing.
Lucy turns pale.

LUCY
What are you doing?

Tumnus whispers, ashamed.

MR. TUMNUS
I’m kidnapping you.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 16.

Lucy backs away, bumping into the table. 'The saucers rattle.
Tumnus can barely whisper it:

MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
The White Witch.

LUCY
I don’t understand.

MR. TUMNUS
The White Witch, the Queen of
Narnia. She’s the one who makes it
always winter, always cold. She
gave orders...

Tumnus’ eyes well. Lucy hands him her HANDKERCHIEF.

MR. TUMNUS (cont‘d)
If I find a human in the woods, I‘m
supposed to turn it over to her.

LUCY
But Mr. Tumnus...you wouldn’t...

Tumnus stares down at*the delicate la

xe He xuns hig thumb
over-the “L" ‘embroidered in ‘tthe cx 5 *

    

Tumnus “looks up at Lucy. Her little face trembles.

LUCY (cont'd)
I thought you.were my friend.

Suddenly, determination fills his eyes. He jumps to his feet
and grabs--her.-by the hand.

MR. TUMNUS
We must hurry. Her secret police
could be here any moment.

23 EXT. NARNIA, FOREST, ROCKY AREA - NIGHT 23

Tumnus and Lucy crash through the snow, destroying their old
footprints as they race from his house.

MR. TUMNUS
Shhh. The Wood is full of her
spies.
(he whispers)
Even some of the trees.

Lucy cranes her neck at a grove of ominous pines.

EXT. NARNIA, LANTERN WASTE ~ NIGHT 24

At the lamp-post, Tumnus looks into Lucy’s eyes.

MR. TUMNUS
Can you find your way back from
here?

LUCY

T think so.
She grabs Tumnus’ hand, worried.

LUCY (cont’d)
Will you be all right?

Tumnus nods, a bit unsure.

MR. TUMNUS
If I’m lucky, she’1l just turn me
to stone.

Lucy gasps, shocked. Tumnus kneels down. His eyes fill with
tears as he hands her back. the HANDKERCHIEF.

MR. TUMNUS (cont‘d)
I’m sorry Lucy Pevensie. I
almost.... :

He breaks down. Lucy pushes his hand back. Smiles gently.
Lucy °
Keep it. You need it more than I
do.
He takes her head in his hands.
MR. TUMNUS
No matter what happens, Lucy
Pevensie, I’m glad to have met you.
You've made me feel warmer than
I've felt in a hundred years.
Lucy smiles. Tumnus taps her on the nose.

MR. TUMNUS (cont‘d)
Now go!

Lucy races away, waving one last time before plunging into
the trees.

Tumnus stares after her, worried.

Lucy throws open the wardrobe room door.

LUCY

Would you shut up? He’s coming.

Peter rounds the corner at the end of the hall.

EDMUND . (cont ‘d)
Great, Lucy, thanks a lot.

. PETER -
I‘m not sure you two have quite got
the idea of this game.

Lucy just gapes at -her brothers.

LUCY
Weren't you wondering where I was?

EDMUND
That’s why you were hiding he was
“seeking” you.

Susan pops out of the window seat.

SUSAN
Does this mean I win?

PETER
I don't think Lucy wants to play
anymore. :

LUCY
I was playing! I was hiding in the
wardrobe, and the next thing, I was
in a wood and it was snowing...

Her brothers and sister exchange puzzled looks.

Lucy drags the others to the wardrobe.
LUCY
...and there was a faun and we had
tea and toast. See for yourselves.
She opens the door to find...COATS.
Lucy's face drops.

Susan pulls the coats apart, revealing THE BACK OF THE
WARDROBE. She gives it a rap with her knuckles.

SUSAN
Sorry, Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

PETER

Good one, Lucy. Had me going.
LUCY

But it’s true. It was all

different.

Lucy searches the wardrobe, her eyes filling with tears.
Peter and Susan share a’ look.

LUCY (cont'd)
I wouldn't lie about this.

I believe you.

LUCY
You do?

Edmund storms out.

Susan shuts the wardrobe with a firm click.

INT. PROFESSOR‘S HOUSE, GIRLS‘ BEDROOM - NIGHT 28

A huge moon bathes the room. Lucy tosses and turns, staring
at the ceiling.

An ominous RUMBLING disturbs the silence. Lucy looks over to
see...Susan snoring. Lucy quietly slips out of bed.
INT. PROFESSOR’S HOUSE, BEDROOM HALL - NIGHT 29

Lucy eases out of her room, wearing shoes and a raincoat.
Carrying a candle, she sneaks away down.the hall.

After a moment , a toilet flushes from behind a door:

Edmurid steps out of the bathroom to see...

Lucy at the far end of the hall.

He grins, and creéps after her.

Lucy opens the WARDROBE ROOM DOOR. She creeps in, closing it
behind her.

INT. PROFESSOR’S HOUSE, WARDROBE ROOM - NIGHT 30

Edmund makes noises to try and scare Lucy.

He creeps to the wardrobe. He climbs inside and...

A SMALL FIGURE standing -stock still in a forest clearing.

Edmund sees the lamppost, stares wide-eyed at the woods
around him. Walks on to,
EXT. NARNIA, FOREST NEAR LANTERN WASTE - CONTINUOUS 35

EDMUND
Lucy? I think I believe you now.

The wind blows through his thin clothes. He turns back to
where the wardrobe should be. He finds nothing.

Suddenly, he stops and listens. There...SLEIGH BELLS.
He peers into the distance.

Through the swirling snow, a flash of black and red appears.

Edmund stares as it grows larger. And larger.

Until finally his eyes widen at the sight of A SLEIGH pulled
by hard-charging WHITE REINDEER.

Snow plumes from the runners. Steam jets from the reindeers’
nostrils as...THE SLEIGH BEARS DOWN.

Edmund jumps back, falling into a snowbank.
The sleigh hisses to a stop, A MEAN-EYED DWARF at the reins.

EDMUND TAKES ONE LOOK AND RUNS, BUT THE DWARF LEAPS DOWN AND
TACKLES HIM.

The dwarf presses A KNIFE to Edmund’s throat.

WHITE WITCH (0.S.)
What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

GINARRBRIK
I’m not sure, your Majesty. If
it's a dwarf, it’s an ugly one.

Edmund turns to the Sleigh where. A FIGURE SITS .IN SHADOW.

The ‘figure steps out of the sleigh. TA BND it moves
effortlessly over =the snow.. Edmund watches until...

aN Agrontsiitnaliy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stands before hin.

EDMUND
Gosh. You're really tall.

Ginarrbrik jabs Edmund.

GINARRBRIK
Is that any way to address the
Queen?

EDMUND
I'm sorry. I didn’t know...your
Majesty.

GINARRBRIK

Not know the Queen of Narnia? You
shall know us better hereafter.

Ginarrbrik presses the knife deeper.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 23.

WHITE WITCH
Ginarrbrik. That’s not how we
treat guests.
Ginarrbrik loosens his grip, confused.

The Witch stares down at Edmund, her green eyes boring in.
Edmund swallows, transfixed.

WHITE WITCH (cont’d)
What is your name, Son of Adam?

Ginarrbrik raises an eyebrow.

EDMUND
E...Edmund.

WHITE WITCH
Edmund, dear. You look so cold.
And those are hardly the clothes
for this kind of weather.
She smiles and extends her slender hand.

WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
Why don’t you join me?

«EDMUND
No, that’s...

Her eyes flash darkly. Edmund swallow.
EDMUND (cont ‘d)
All right...thankyou.

The Witch sits Edmund beside her in the sleigh, cocooning him
in her fur.

Ginarrbrik scowls and sheathes his dagger.
WHITE WITCH
Perhaps you like something hot to
drink, Edmund?

EDMUND
Yes, please...your Majesty.

She takes out a SMALL COPPER VIAL, pops the cork and lets A
SINGLE DROP fall to the snow.

Edmund gapes as the SNOW MELTS UPWARDS, forming a steaming
JEWELED CUP. Ginarrbrik hands it to him.

GINARRBRIK
your drink. Sir.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 24,

Edmund hesitates, then sips. His shiverihg stops and a smile
spreads across his face.

WHITE WITCH
It’s dull, Son of Adam, to drink
without eating. What would you like
best to eat?

EDMUND
Can you make...anything?

WHITE WITCH
Anything you can imagine. And some
things you probably can’t.
She smiles. Edmund thinks for a long moment.

EDMUND
Turkish Delight?

WHITE WITCH
A connoisseur.

She tips the bottle once more, dropping a RUBY-COLORED PRARL.

A GLITTERING BOX appears. Ginarrbrik hands at up to. Edmund.
o Edmund: téars “it open, gawking at rows of -TURKISH DELIGHT.

He puts a piece in his mouth. His eyes glaze as he chews.
WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
So, Edmund...how.pray did you come
to enter my déminions?
EDMUND
I don't know. I was just following
my sister, and-

WHITE WITCH
There are more of you?

Edmund shovels Turkish Delight with both hands.

EDMUND
Four. Me, Peter, Susan and Lucy.

Ginarrbrik shoots his Queen an alarmed glance.

WHITE WITCH
Four?

Edmund smiles, his mouth gummed up with jelly.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 25.

EDMUND
Lucy came first. She said she had
tea with a faun, but we didn’t
believe her.

Edmund finishes the Turkish Delight.

WHITE WITCH
I would very much like to meet your
brother and sisters.

EDMUND
Why? They’re nothing special.

Edmund noisily sucks his fingers clean.

WHITE WITCH
I’m sure they're not as delightful
as you are.

The Witch plucks off Ginarrbrik’s hat and gently wipes the
boy’s sticky mouth. Ginarrbrik seethes. He snatches the hat
back and wipes it on his trouser leg.

SHE LOOKS DEEP INTO EDMUND‘'S EYES, READING HIM.

a pow diy, o° WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
You know, Edmund,’ I have no
children’ of my own. If you were to
prove yourself to me, it’s possible
that you might one day become
Prince of Narnia.

(she leans closer)

Or perhaps even King.

Edmund smiles, then looks doubtful.
EDMUND
You’d probably choose Peter before
me.

She brushes his hair back from his brow.

WHITE WITCH
But Edmund, I have chosen you.

She smiles warmly at him.
WHITE WITCH (cont‘d)
Of course, you‘d need your family.
After all, what’s a king without
servants?

Edmund smiles.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 26.

EDMUND
Peter would be my servant?

She turns his head to face TWO DARK HILLS on the horizon.
WHITE WITCH
All you’d have to do is bring your
brother and sisters to my house.
It's just between those hills.
She cups his face.

WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
What fun we're going to have.

Edmund smiles. She helps him down from the sled.
He looks longingly at the empty box.

EDMUND
Can't I have a bit more-

WHITE WITCH
At my house, there are rooms just
full of Turkish Delight!

 

Ginarrbrik ¢racks his whip and the reindeer spring to life.
The Witch waves to-Edmund as the sleigh sweeps her away.

Neat WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
Until then, dear one! . Don’t
forget! ~.Come~soon!

The sleigh fades into the white, hazy distance.

Edmund stands alone, dazed.

After a moment, he hears FOOTSTEPS on the snow behind him.

LUCY (0.S.)
Edmund?

He whips around to see LUCY RUNNING TO HIM.
LUCY (cont'd)
Oh, Edmund, you got in, too. I
told you it was real! Isn’t it
wonderful?
Edmund wipes his mouth guiltily.

EDMUND
Where‘ve you been?
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved.

Lucy
With Mr. Tumnus! The White Witch
hasn’t found out anything about him
meeting me or letting me go. So
everything’s going to be all right
after all!

Edmund looks down at the sleigh tracks in the snow.

EDMUND
The White Witch?

LUCY
She calls herself the Queen of
Narnia, but she’s not the rightful
Queen at all.

Edmund shivers and turns away.

LucY (cont'd)
Don’t you feel well, Edmund? You
look awful.

Edmund frowns at her.

EDMUND
Well, it's pretty poor sport
standing‘around freezing in the
snow. How do we get out of here?

LUCY
This way, silly.

Lucy takes his hand. He stumbles along with her, pale.

LUCY (cont’d)
The others will have to believe in
Narnia now that we've both been
here.

Susan shuffles in from the hall to find LUCY jumping on
Peter’s bed. Edmund slouches on his bed.

LucY
Peter, Peter, wake up! It’s there,

Peter moves Lucy down to the floor.

PETER
Ssh, what are you talking about?

LUCY
Narnia. It’s all in the wardrobe

They all turn to Edmund.

LUCY (cont ’d)

Lucy ‘smiles at him, her eyes shining. . Edmund opens his mouth
to speak, but...

MRS. MACREADY (0%5,3”
What in the world is going on?

Mrs. Macready stands in the doorway in a flannel nightgown.
EDMUND'S DARK EYES stare blankly for a long moment. Finally:

EDMUND
It’s nothing.

He looks at Lucy, smiling thinly.
EDMUND (cont'd)
Lucy and I were just playing a
game.

Lucy's expectant face crumples. SHE BRUSHES PAST MRS.

SUSAN
Oh, Lu.

Susan runs after her. Furious, Mrs. Macready turns to the
boys.

She glares at them before closing the door.

EDMUND
That's the trouble with little
kids. They just don’t know when to
stop-

PETER
Will you grow up?!

EDMUND
But it’s all nonsense.

PETER
Of course it’s nonsense. Which is
why you encouraging her is just
making it worse!

EDMUND
But I thought--

PETER
No you didn't! That’s the problem.
You never think.
Edmund sneers. He turns to the wall.
EDMUND
Shut up. You’re not Dad! I wish
you weren't even my brother!!

Peter fumes, frustrated.

No. But...I mean...we don’t even

this in the family.

SUSAN
Has that been working so far?

They reach the PROFESSOR’S DOOR.

We have to do something.

Peter looks at Susan. He rolls her eyes and...KNOCKS.
PROFESSOR KIRKE (0.S.')
Come in.
INT. PROFESSOR'S HOUSE, PROFESSOR‘S OFFICE — DAY 39

Peter and Susan step timidly inside. Shelves line the walis,
crammed with ancient books and artifacts.

A massive desk looms beneath a window, and behind it sits...

A WH BATRA He pores over an old book, his
spectacles ¢¥inting in the lamp light.

 

PETER
Professor Kirke?

PROFESSOR KIRKE
(casually)
*Ah...children. Pleasure to meet
you. Do come in. Is everything
alright?

SUSAN
Actually, sir, we have a question
about our sister.

The Professor looks up mildly interested.
PETER
She’s...well it seems she’s been
lying.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
That's a very serious charge.

Finally, Susan just blurts.
SUSAN

She says she found a magical land
in the upstairs wardrobe.

The Professor's head snaps up.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
What did you say?

PETER
Um, the wardrobe upstairs...

The Professor pops out from behind his desk. He gathers the
children and seats them on the couch.

PETER (cont‘d)
Lucy insists she found a forest
inside.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
What was it like?

SUSAN
Like talking to a lunatic-—

PROFESSOR KIRKE
Not her, the forest.

Peter and Susan look at each other, confused.

: “PETER «~ .
You're not saying:you: believe her?

isn‘t true?

SUSAN
Edmund said that they had just been
pretending.

And he’s usually the more truthful
of the two is he?

Susan looks at Peter. They both shake their heads.

PETER
No.

SUSAN
That‘s just it, up until now I
would say Lucy is very honest.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
Do you think she’s mad? Insane?

SUSAN
Probably not.

The Professor takes a PIPE from the hand of a WOODEN MONKEY.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
What do they teach them in these
schools?

He unscrews a SILVER APPLE, revealing a core of TOBACCO.

PROFESSOR KIRKE (cont'd)
If Lucy isn’t lying, and she’s not
mad, then logically, unless further
evidence turns up...

He lights his pipe, waves away a cloud of smoke.

PROFESSOR KIRKE (cont’‘d)
We must assume she's telling the
truth.

SUSAN
But it’s impossible.

PROFESSOR KIRKE
There's that word. Seems to make
everything smaller somehow, doesn't
it?

Peter and Susan gape. The Professor pulls up a chair.

Peter studies Lucy from the ping-pong table. Edmund sits
below the table, bored.

Peter bats a ball over to Lucy. It bounces off her head and
lands in her lap.

PETER
I say, was that in or out?

Lucy ignores him and looks out the window.

Come on, Lucy. You ping. I'll
pong.
Susan giggles. Lucy shakes her head. Tries not to smile.

EDMUND
I‘ll play.

BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO HEAR HIM.
Peter and Susan kneel near Lucy.
SUSAN
You and me, Lucy. Peter can’t beat
both of us.

PETER
That sounds like a challenge.

They drag Lucy over to the table.

Edmund scowls and drops his paddle to the floor. He stalks
into the next room, IRRITATED.

Susan puts a paddle into Lucy’s floppy hand.

Peter does his best to ward off Susan and Lucy. He CLOWNS,
playing with his left hand, HOPPING on ONE LEG.

EDMUND (0.S.)
Bow down for King Edmund!

Edmund stands in the doorway, brandishing a SWORD.
Peter laughs and strikes a combat stance with his paddle.

PETER
En garde!

Edmund and Peter thrust and parry across the room. Edmund
struggles with the unwieldy sword.

Peter darts in and taps Edmund's cheek. The girls laugh.
EDMUND‘S FACE GOES COLD, insulted by their laughter.

HE TAKES A SAVAGE SWING. OUT OF CONTROL, WITH THE OVERSIZE
SWORD. SUSAN SCREAMS.

Peter dives..out of .the way just as THE SWORD SMASHES A SUIT
OF ARMOR. Silver pieces fly.apart, clattering on the floor.

Peter lies on the ground, panting. Edmund gapes at the
shattered armor. He drops the sword with a clang.

LUCY
Edmund, what are you doing?

MRS. MACREADY (0.S.)
And in the next room, you'll see a
remarkable example of Fourteenth
Century plate armor.

They run round a corner and skid to a halt in front of THE

They run in and shut the door behind them.

The four children pant in the quiet. But then...THE

Peter yanks ‘open the wardrobe door. They scramble inside,
leaving the door AJAR.

Peter puts his eye to the crack. Outside, the DOORKNOB
starts to-turn.
All four kids scrunch further into the wardrobe.

Peter and Susan inch themselves backward, reaching behind

Crockery and furniture clutter the floor, SMASHED TO BITS.

Edmund stares down at the SHREDDED PORTRAIT of Tumnus’
father. He looks away.

Lucy tearfully cradles a BROKEN TEA CUP.

Peter takes a slow step toward the Beaver, holding out his
hand as if to a dog. He makes a clucking noise.

LUCY
He means the trees.

Lucy follows him.
Susan and Peter look around at the forest, suspicious. They
race after Lucy.

51 EXT. ROCKY CREVASSE - DAY 51

Susan warily follows Lucy and the Beaver. Out of earshot,
Edmund tugs on Peter's coat.

How do we know what side this
beaver 's on?

Peter listens impatiently.

He's friends. with. the faun.

TIME CUT:

54 INT. BEAVERS’ LODGE -— NIGHT 54
The Pevensies and Beavers sit at a table full of fish dishes.
PETER
Couldn't we just go to the Witch
and plead Tumnus’ case?

MR. BEAVER
You could go all right.

MRS. BEAVER
But very few who enter that castle
ever come out again.

LUCY,
Then Mr. Tumnus is...

Lucy tears up. Mrs. Beaver pets her hair.

MRS. BEAVER
There is hope, child.

MR.* BEAVER
Indeed, the greatest hope there
ever ‘was.
The children stare. Beaver puffs up, enjoying the attention.

MR. BEAVER (cont'd)
Aslan is on the move.

Peter, Susan and Lucy stare in silence, strangely calmed.
Then...

EDMUND
Who's Aslan?

The Beavers gape. Their big teeth hang in their open mouths.

MR. BEAVER
You don’t know?

MRS. BEAVER
Oh, my, you do come from a bad
place.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 45.

~ MR. BEAVER
He’s only the King of the whole
wood, Lord of all Narnia!

MRS. BEAVER
He‘s been away a long time, but now
he‘s back!

MR. BEAVER
Aye. And he’s gathering an army at
the Stone Table! Now we'll sort out
the White Witch once and for all.

EDMUND
Won’t she just turn him to stone?

Beaver throws back his head, laughing. Edmund flushes.

MRS. BEAVER
Trust me, if the White Witch can so
much as look Aslan in the eye, I'll
be surprised.

Beaver drains his beer and puts the mug down with a thump.

MR." BEAVER .
But you‘ll see for yourselves soon
enough. We'll set out in the
morning.

PETER
For where?

MR. BEAVER
The. Stone Table. If we're to save
Tumnus, we'll need Aslan to do it.

SUSAN
But you just said he was getting
ready to fight a war.
Beaver leans forward, his face lit by candlelight.
MR. BEAVER
And he‘1ll need every hand he can
get.
Susan shoots Peter an alarmed glance.
PETER
Look, I know you mean well, but
this all sounds rather dangerous.

Peter stands.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 46.

PETER (cont'd)
I’m sorry. Thank you for dinner.

The Beavers stare, stunned.

LUCY
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

PETER
Lucy, it’s time the four of us were
getting home. Susan?
She nods enthusiastically.

PETER (cont’d)
Ed?

Peter searches the room, landing on EDMUND’S EMPTY CHAIR.

BEAVER'S FUR BRISTLES.

55 EXT. BEAVERS’ MOUND -— NIGHT 55
SNOWY FOOTPRINTS lead from the mound and across the river.

Peter, Susany Lucy: and Beaver stare at the tracks.

 

° PETER
Edmund!
~ LUCY
“EDMUND |
MR. BEAVER

When did he leave?

SUSAN
What? I‘m not sure...

MR. BEAVER
It's vital that we try and remember
what he heard.

PETER
Why?

Beaver points up TOWARD THE TWO DARK HILLS.

MR. BEAVER
Because he’s gone to her.

EXT. NARNIA, ROCKY AREA ~ NIGHT 56
THE SPIRES OF THE WITCH’S CASTLE twist between the two hills.

Edmund stares hungrily as he stumbles through knee-high snow.

EXT. NARNIA, FOREST ~ NIGHT 57

Peter and Beaver race through the trees. Susan and Lucy
strain to catch up.

MR. BEAVER
There’s no point in this! You
won’t get him back this way!
You've lost him to the Witch.

PETER
No, I haven't!

MR. BEAVER
You tell me you trust him, then.

Peter whips around.
- |. PETER .
Ivcan still catch himt
EXT. CASTLE HILL - NIGHT . 58

Edmund leans against a boulder, panting. He stares up at the
CASTLE looming atop the hill.

A cold wind pulls at his collar. He turns and looks behind
him, almost regretful.

But the wind turns and PUSHES HIM TOWARD THE CASTLE. He
grabs a rock and climbs.
EXT. CASTLE HILL - NIGHT 59

Peter tears across the snow, stopping at the rocks where his
brother’s footprints end.

Susan and Lucy look up the hillside to where...EDMUND CLIMBS,
tiny against the cliff.

LUCY
Edmund!

MR, BEAVER
Shhh! They'll hear you.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 48.

Peter throws himself up the rocks. Beaver tackles him.

SUSAN
But, he's our brother!

MR. BEAVER
He's the bait! The Witch wants all
four of you.

SUSAN
Why?

MR. BEAVER
To kill you.

Peter and Susan stare at Beaver, shocked. Then,

LUCY
Look!

Lucy points helplessly as...

Edmund hauls himself to the top. In front of him, an OPEN
GATE yawns. Edmund walks through, VANISHING.

PETER
Blast him!

Susan turns on Peter angrily.

SUSAN
I told you we,should've gone back!
But you wouldn't listen!

PETER
Oh, you knew this would happen?

SUSAN
I didn't know what would happen!
Which is why we should've left
while we still could.

LUCY
Stop it! Both of you!

Peter and Susan glare, wind whipping their faces.

LUCY (cont'd)
This isn’t helping Edmund!

MR. BEAVER
The only thing to do now is get as
far away from this place as
possible.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 49,

PETER
And just leave him?

MR, BEAVER
Only Aslan can help Edmund now.

LUCY
Then take us to him.

Everyone turns. Lucy stares up at the dark cliff. She turns
to them, tearful.

LUCY (cont’d)
What choice do we have?
EXT. WITCH'S CASTLE, COURTYARD - NIGHT 60
GNAWED, CHARRED BONES lie in ASHES.

Edmund steps over the remains of a watch fire into the
courtyard.

A DARK SHAPE appears, then vanishes in the swirling snow.
Suddenly, the flurries fade...THERE STANDS A HUGE GRAY TIGER.
EDMUND FREEZES. THE TIGER STARES.

THEN, SLOWLY, SNOW BUILDS ON THE ANIMAL'S SNOUT.

Edmund reaches out and touches the tiger. Nothing. Stone.

EDMUND
Ha.

Edmund plucks up a piece of burnt wood from the dead fire and
DRAWS on the tiger: GLASSES AND A MOUSTACHE. He laughs
NERVOUSLY.

Edmund walks further inside.

STATUES SURROUND HIM. Across the courtyard, STONE CREATURES
stand like chess pieces, their faces frozen in fear.

Atop a flight of stairs, Edmund finds a HUGE GRAY WOLF. He
raises his leg to step over the statue.

THE WOLF SNARLS TO LIFE. With one massive paw, IT PINS
EDMUND TO THE WALL.

Conon
Be still}

stranger; or you‘ll never
move again.
61

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 50.

Edmund freezes. The wolf‘s yellow eyes beam at him.

MAUGRIM (cont'd)
Who are you?

EDMUND
I‘m Edmund. I met the Queen in the
woods. She asked me to come back.
I’m a...Son of Adam.
Maugrim suddenly removes his paw.
MAUGRIM
My apologies, fortunate favorite of
the Queen.
(sneers)
Or perhaps, not so fortunate.
Edmund slowly comes off the wall, surprised.
MAUGRIM (cont‘d)
Do follow me.
INT. WITCH’S CASTLE, GREAT HALL ~ NIGHT 61

Maugrim leads Edmund into A VAST, ARCHING HALL, BUILT
ENTIRELY OF. GLITTERING ICE... °

MORE WOLVES stand sentry, eyeing Edmund coldly as he passes.
Maugrim growls. The wolves bow their heads.

Edmund's fearful look turns to a haughty grin.

At the end of the hall sits...

AN EMPTY, FROZEN THRONE.

Edmund approaches, hesitant.

He gazes at the intricate carvings and sharp corners. He
finds his reflection in the polished ice.

WHITE WITCH (0.S.)
Like it?

The Witch’s reflection appears beside him. Edmund turns to
see her wrapped in ermine.

EDMUND
Very much.

She runs her long fingers across his cheek.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 51.

WHITE WITCH .
Then you should have one just like
it.

She glances at Maugrim, who gruffly SHAKES HIS HEAD.
WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
Tell me, Edmund, are your sisters
deaf?

EDMUND
No.

WHITE WITCH
Is your brother...unintelligent?

EDMUND
No. What-

WHITE WITCH
Then how dare you come alone!!

Edmund hangs his head. Choking back tears.

EDMUND
I tried..,°

. WHITE WITCH
Edmund... I asked for so little.

EDMUND
They just don‘t listen to me.

WHITE WITCH
‘And you couldn’t even do that.

The Witch sighs and takes out her wand.
EDMUND
But I did bring them. Halfway!
They‘re in the little house on the
dam. With the Beavers.
The Witch turns to Maugrim.

WHITE WITCH
Maugrim, You know what to do.

Maugrim lets out a HOWL, breaking into a dead run. The
SENTRY WOLVES peel off and follow.

Edmund swallows and turns back to the Witch, hopeful. She
sits down on her throne, just staring at him.

have some...Turkish Delight?
She smiles.

WHITE WITCH
Ginarrbrik?

Ginarrbrik steps from the shadows. He eyes Edmund with
hatred.

GINARRBRIK
Yes, my Queen?

WHITE WITCH
Our guest is hungry.

Edmund smiles. So does Ginarrbrik, BROWN TEETH AND BLACK
GUMS.

GINARRBRIK

Beaver tries to drag her toward the door.
MR. BEAVER
Only if the Witch serves toast in
prison.
Mrs. Beaver squeezes her basket closed.
MRS. BEAVER
Oh, shush, You'll be thanking me
later.

SUDDENLY, THE BAYING OF WOLVES PIERCES THE NIGHT AIR. The
group freezes, trapped.

PETER
If there is a later.

SPLINTERS FLY as the wolves burst through the door.
They ransack the room, shredding everything.

Finally, Maugrim stops. He sniffs. His head swivels to A
ROUGH-HEWN WARDROBE.

The wolf eases open the wardrobe door, revealing...A TUNNEL.
Maugrim’s yellow eyes narrow.
MAUGRIM
Smell them out.

MR. BEAVER
We'll be safe up ahead. A Badger

comes up right near his place.

MRS. BEAVER
And his barrel of ale, I shouldn't
wonder.

Beaver rolls his eyes.

Lucy’s long coat catches on a root. She falls to the ground.
Susan reaches to help, but...

LUCY
Sssh.

Everyone freezes. Lucy's eyes widen in fear.

LUCY (cont'd)
They're in the tunnel.

The: group barrels around a corner and hits...A DEAD END.
MRS. BEAVER

MR. BEAVER
There wasn’t room next to the jam!
Peter, kneel down!

Beaver leaps onto Peter’s back, reaching for the ceiling.

EXT, ALLIES’ ENCLAVE - NIGHT 71
A ROCK rolls away, revealing BEAVER. The others climb out.

A TINY VILLAGE sits in the pale moonlight. A Mother Otter
draws water from the well. Squirrel children play nearby.

Beaver leads the others in a run for the town.

Lucy peers at the squirrels standing still under a tree.
Mrs. Beaver follows her gaze.
72

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 55.

MRS. BEAVER
Something's wrong.

The village stands disconcertingly SILENT.
Everyone gapes, horrified as they realize:
THE ENTIRE TOWN HAS BEEN TURNED TO STONE.

A BADGER stands frozen, baring his fierce claws. Beaver lays
a hand on his old friend, tears welling.

MR. BEAVER
Now do you see what we're up
against?

The Pevensies stare, devastated.

INT. WITCH’S CASTLE, DUNGEON -— NIGHT 72
EDMUND sits alone in a cell. Bugs scurry everywhere.

He tries to eat a piece of bread, but gags. He takes a gulp
of water but immediately, spits it out. ~He looks.in the cup.

MORE BUGS float in the water.
He pushés away his meal, disgusted.

VOICE (0.S.)
Excuse me.

Edmund jumps up, startled. “He looks into the next cell.

EDMUND
What do you want?

He approaches warily. There on the floor lies...
MR. TUMNUS, gaunt, beaten, his hooves shackled to the floor.
MR. TUMNUS
Sorry. I’d get up, but I’m afraid
my legs aren’t working very well.

Edmund stares, realizing.

EDMUND
Mr. Tumnus...?

MR. TUMNUS
What's left of him, at least.

Edmund looks away. Tumnus smiles awkwardly.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 56.

Beaver scowls at Fox, distrustful.

Beaver points at the stone badger.

MR. BEAVER
Is that what you told him?

Fox nods at the dirt flying from the hole.
FOX
I‘d hurry. They get rather
unpleasant when they're hungry.
THE FIRST PAW SCRATCHES AT THE LIP OF THE HOLE.

Fox whirls and darts into the trees.

SUSAN
But-

Beaver sets his feet and faces the HOLE.

Susan looks down at her CARDIGAN with its SCHOOL CREST.

SUSAN
I couldn't.

FOX
Wolves. Hungry wolves.

Susan yanks off her sweater and gives it to Fox. He bows,
then WHISTLES.

The trees above them rustle. Everyone locks up, alarmed as
TWO SATYRS DROP DOWN, landing lithely on muscular legs.

Fox tosses them the sweater.

FOX, (cont'd)

The satyrs break off into the trees, Susan's sweater

FOX
Greetings, wolf brethren.

The wolves skid to a stop. Fox smiles innocently.

MAUGRIM
Where are the humans?

FOX
Now, that’s a valuable piece of
information, don’t you think?
He leans against a tree.

TILT UP THE TRUNK, high into the air, where...Peter, Susan,
Lucy and the Beavers watch from a platform.

Peter grits his teeth.
Below, Fox grooms his tail.
FOX (cont‘d)

I imagine there’d be at least a
nominal reward for something like

where are they?

Vardan tightéfis* his jaws. Fox yelps. Slowly, HE RAISES HIS
PAW “TO POINT...

Susan bites her lip. Peter’s hand clenches into a fist.
But Fox points off INTO THE FOREST.

FOX
South. They ran south.

Peter relaxes his hand.
Another wolf examines the ground where Fox pointed.

WOLF
Captain, the scent continues.

VARDAN THROWS FOX TO THE GROUND. MAUGRIM HOWLS, leading his
pack after the satyrs.

in the tree, Lucy stares down at Fox's motionless body.

Suddenly, his bushy tail twitches...and waves. Lucy grins as
Fox stands and smiles up at them.

LUCY
Are you all right?

FOX
Oh, don’t worry, your Majesty.
Their bark is worse than their
bite.

SUSAN
Why do you keep calling us that?

Fox looks at her curiously. He turns to Beaver.

FOX
They don’t know?

Peter eyes Beaver, suspicious.

PETER
Don‘t know what?

EXT. ALLIES’ ENCLAVE - NIGHT 77

Fox hands Beaver a’ branch. Beaver bites it down to size and
tosses it on a fire. Mrs. Beavér passes out bread and jam.

MR. BEAVER
There‘s a prophecy.

Peter, Susan and Lucy stare at Beaver.

MR. BEAVER (cont‘d)

“When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone
Sits at Cair Paravel in throne, The
evil time will be over and done.”

The kids just stare.

MR. BEAVER (cont'd)
I know it doesn't quite rhyme....

Mrs. Beaver pats him on the paw. Beaver continues.

MR. BEAVER (cont'd)
On the shore of the Eastern Ocean
is a castle, Cair Paravel. Inside
are four thrones. It is said, when
two Sons of Adam and Two Daughters
of Eve fill those thrones, Narnia
will once more be at peace.

The Pevensies stare in disbelief.

PETER
And you think we're the ones?

FOX
You'd better be.

MR. BEAVER
We've been expecting you for a
hundred years.

PETER
Look, I'm sorry, but you've made a
mistake. We're not heroes.

LUCY
We're from Finchley.

Susan stares at the three expectant animals.

This makes absolutely no sense.

MRS. BEAVER
Your sense comes from your world,

He sighs and looks over at the sleeping animals.

What they expect doesn't matter.
Because it isn’t true.

PETER
And what happens when they work

Suddenly, THE LOCK CLANGS. Edmund stands as...
THE WITCH STRIDES IN WITH GINARRBRIK,.

Edmund goes white.

everything?

SHE GRABS HIS FACE. Tumnus watches in terror.
WHITE WITCH
Where did they go? They must have
said something?
Edmund whimpers. Tumnus grips his bars.
EDMUND
I don’t know. The Beaver said
something about...Aslan?
THE WITCH'S EYES FREEZE. She drops Edmund to the floor.

She rubs her mouth; as if suddenly starving.

Where?

EDMUND

TUMNUS BANGS WILDLY AGAINST HIS BARS.
MR. TUMNUS
He‘s a stranger here, your Majesty.
He doesn’t know anything!

The Witch glares at Tumnus. Ginarrbrik knocks the faun back.
She turns back to Edmund.

WHITE WITCH
I said, where is Aslan?

Tumnus shoots Edmund a desperate look. Edmund stares at him
for a long moment, then...

EDMUND

said...I wanted to see you.

WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
Do you know why you're here, faun?

He tries to straighten up proudly.

You’re here because he turned you
in. For sweets. (ALT: For candy)
Tumnus looks at Edmund, confused.

Two dwarfs drag Edmund past dozens of the Witch‘s statues.

There, trapped in an alcove, illuminated by flickering
torchlight, stands...

MR. TUMNUS. FROZEN IN PAIN.

Edmund stares, his spirit broken.

EXT. ALLIES’ ENCLAVE - DAWN 83

Peter sleeps by the now dead fire. Suddenly, he awakens to a
CRACKING SOUND.

Through THE BLACK AND WHITE TRUNKS of the frozen forest,
Peter can make out...RED.

He picks up a stick and moves through the trees. He pushes
past a branch and gasps.

A LUSH CHERRY TREE BURSTS WITH LIVING COLOR in the midst of
the frozen wood.

Peter stares at the full bunches of bright fruit.

Slowly, RED PETALS flutter from the tree. They pour down,
then sweep up, coalescing into the shape of...

A WOMAN.
Peter’s eyes -go wide. He raises his stick.
DRYAD
There’s nothing to fear, my King.

Her voice chimes like a bell. Peter has to shake himself.

. PETER
“I'm: nobody's king.

The Dryad moves forward with the sound of rustling leaves.
DRYAD

You have freed the spirits of the
trees from the prison of our frozen

boughs.
PETER
Look, I did no such-
DRYAD

sapling...
Her hand brushes his cheek. He blushes, dropping his stick.
DRYAD (cont'd)
But a sapling is a tree
nonetheless.

urgency. Your brother is alive.

But you must hurry if you hope to
save him. The White Witch is on
her way.
Peter stares, mesmerized.

PETER
Who are-

But she just kisses his hand and BURSTS into a thousand
petals. They flutter up and vanish into the cherry tree.

Dazed, Peter opens his hand. A PERFECT PINK CHERRY BLOSSOM
appears where she kissed it.

Peter peers out across the immense expanse.

some foothills. You see the

A TINY DARK MOUND wavers on the horizon.

FOX
Well, the little gray bit on top of
that, that’s the Stone Table.

SUSAN
I thought you said you knew a
shortcut.

FOX

You’ll save two days if you cross
the Frozen River,

Susan peers at a long green strip in the distance.

SUSAN
Frozen? Is it safe?

FOX
Hard as a rock for a hundred years.
Quite lovely, actually. Almost
wish I was crossing it with you.

SUSAN
You're not coming?

: MR. BEAVER
T might’ve known.

FOX
Friend. Aslan’s readying an army.
He‘ll need soldiers and I can get
them.
Fox turns to the children.
FOX (cont'd)
It’s been a distinct honour and
privilege, your Majesties.
He turns to go. Mrs. Beaver nudges Mr. Beaver.

MR. BEAVER
Oh. .ah...Fox...?

The Fox turns.

MR. BEAVER (cont'd)
Good luck.

They exchange a smile.

EXT. FROZEN LAKE - DAY

FIVE TINY FIGURES make their way over a landscape of white.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved, 68.

The Beavers gallop easily over the snowy plain. The
Pevensies lag behind, their legs bogging down in the snow.

PETER
If he tells us to hurry one more
time, I'm going to use his tail as
a cricket bat.
At the shore, Beaver clambers atop a mound,
MR. BEAVER
Hurry, humans! While you're still
young!
Peter seethes.

Something catches Beaver’s eye. In the far distance...A
ROOSTERTAIL OF SNOW PLUMES IN THE AIR.

Beaver’s eyes go wide. He cups his paws:

MR. BEAVER (cont’d)
Hurry up! Run! Run!

out in the snow, the children sigh.

LUCY
Hé is getting a bit bossy.

Mrs. Beaver jumps up and down.
- MRS BEAVER
BEHIND YOU! IT’S HER!
The children turn: ”
A SPEEDING SLEIGH BEARS DOWN ON THEM.
Peter grabs Lucy and runs for shore.
The air shakes with the sound of SLEIGH BELLS.
Susan slips on the ice, scrambling.
Atop the sleigh, A TALL FIGURE stands at the reigns.

Beaver points to a SMALL, HOLE between two icy slabs.

MR. BEAVER
Inside! Dive! Dive!

The children throw themselves into the hole.

Beaver jams himself in. He sticks for a moment, then slips
inside, tail flapping behind.

INT. SHUDDERING WOOD — DAY 86

Beavers and humans lie crammed in a tiny hole, trembling as
the SLEIGH BELLS GROW LOUDER.

Finally, with a hiss of runners, THE SLEIGH STOPS RIGHT
OUTSIDE.

A shadow passes over the mouth of the hole. Lucy swallows.
They wait. Finally,

LUCY
Perhaps she’s gone.

Both girls look at Peter.

PETER
I guess £'11 look.
MR. BEAVER
No. You're worth nothing to Narnia

dead.
Beaver squares his shoulders. Mrs. Beaver reaches for him.
“ MRS. BEAVER
Neither are you, Beaver.
He sqpieezes her hand, then slips into the light.
Everyone waits. Susan holds Mrs. Beaver, frightened.
And then comes the sound of...LAUGHTER.

MR. BEAVER (0.S.)
Come up! Come out!

Beaver pops his face back into the hole.
MR. BEAVER (cont‘d)
There's someone here to see you.
EXT. FROZEN LAKE -— DAY 87
Lucy peeks out of the hole.
TWO HUGE REINDEER REST IN FRONT OF AN ANCIENT SLEIGH.
And there, next to Beaver, stands...

A TALL MAN IN A BRIGHT RED ROBE AND A GREAT WHITE BEARD. A
BROADSWORD ON HIS HIP, he could be an ancient WARRIOR or...

Lucy GRINS

LUCY
Merry Christmas, sir.

FATHER CHRISTMAS beams. He gladly shakes her hand.

FATHER CHRISTMAS
Merry Christmas, Lucy.

Peter gapes. Astonished.

MRS. BEAVER
After all these years.

SUSAN
I’ve put up with a lot since I got
here, but this-

Peter steps in front of her.

PETER
We heard there was no Christmas in
Narnia.

. FATHER CHRISTMAS

Thé Witch has kept me out for a
long time. But her magic is
finally’ weakening. The ice is
dosing its grip on the

world. - thanks to you all.

SUSAN -

FATHER CHRISTMAS
You’ve given Narnia back its hope.

He reaches into his sleigh and pulls out a SACK.
FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont'd)
You've still a difficult road
ahead, however. I hope these will
be of some help along your way.
Father Christmas turns to Peter.
FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont‘d)
peter, the time to use these is
near at hand. Bear them well.
He gives him A SHIELD, SWORD AND SCABBARD.

Peter examines the sword, AWESTRUCK AND REVERENT.

PETER
Thank you, sir.

Susan shoots him a look, surprised.
Father Christmas crouches before Lucy.

FATHER CHRISTMAS
For you, Lucy...

He gives her a small JEWELED VIAL.

FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont‘d)
fhe juice of the fire-flower. One
drop will cure any injury. And,
though I pray you never have to use
it...

He hands her a TINY DAGGER. Lucy weighs it in her hand.

LUCY
I think I could be brave enough.

FATHER CHRISTMAS
I’m sure you could, my dear, but
battles are ugly affairs.

He turns to Susan:

FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont'd)
Now Susan, because.life is not
lived entirely in the mind...

He hands her .a BOW and QUIVER OF ARROWS. She holds them
awkwardly with her fingertips.

FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont‘d)
And though you don’t seem to have a
problem making yourself heard...

Father Christmas gives her a wink. Susan blinks, startled.
He gives her an IVORY HORN.

FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont.’d)
Blow this, and wherever you are,
help will come.

SUSAN
But I don’t

Father Christmas just climbs into his sleigh.

FATHER CHRISTMAS
I'm afraid I must be off. The work
does pile up when you've been gone
a hundred years.
88

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 72.

He turns to the Beavers.
FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont’d)
But don’t worry. Your gifts will be
awaiting your return.
Lucy looks up at him.

LUCY
But...what about for Edmund?

FATHER CHRISTMAS
I hope these gifts will help you
save him.
He cups her chin.
FATHER CHRISTMAS (cont ‘d)
That you're willing to try should
be gift enough for Edmund.
Peter steps forward, his sword hanging regally at his side.

PETER
Thank you, sir.

: . FATHER CHRISTMAS
Ghank you, your highness. Long
live Aslan. And Merry Christmas.

He cracks the reins. The sleigh shoots off across the ice,
the menacing roostertail; now a béautiful sight.

Everyone watches him gos.-Finally, Lucy turns to Susan.

LUCY
I told you he was real.

Susan opens her mouth to speak, then just shuts it.

EXT. NARNIA, FOREST - DAY 88
WOLVES FAN THROUGH THE FOREST, TRACKING A SCENT.

From her sleigh, the Witch leads her hunting party.
Ginarrbrik smiles as muddy slush spatters Edmund's face.

GINARRBRIK
Is it me, your majesty, or is there
a touch of spring in the air?

WHITE WITCH
It’s you, Ginarrbrik.

Maugrim drops back and runs alongside the sleigh.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 73.

MAUGRIM ‘
We've picked up the scent, your
majesty. He’s just up ahead.

The Witch smiles.

WHITE WITCH
Delightful.

EXT. NARNIA, OAK FOREST — DAY 89

Fox prepares his party for war. Satyrs and squirrels pack
provisions.

FOX
Pack light, my friends...

He nudges a WINE BOTTLE over to a squirrel.

FOX (cont'd)
But not too light.

The squirrel looks past Fox and...DROPS THE BOTTLE. Seeing
the squirrel’s terrified eyes, Fox spins.

THERE STANDS°THE WITCH. EDMUND SITS IN THE NEARBY SLEIGH.

WHITE WITCH
Having a picnic?

FOX
Your highness. Why...yes. And we
couldn’t have asked for a lovelier
“guest of honor.

WHITE WITCH
How gracious. And you were so
helpful to my wolves last evening.
I thought perhaps you might assist
me now.

She smiles tightly and pulls out her wand.
WHITE WITCH (cont‘d)
Where have they gone? Where is
Aslan?
Fox shoots the others a look of resolve. He swallows.
FOX
Aslan...is back? Well I suppose we
should set another place...

The Witch strokes Fox's chin with her wand.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 74.

WHITE WITCH
Such a charming creature. And such
a dead one.

THE WITCH RAISES HER WAND TO STRIKE.

EDMUND
WAIT!

Edmund jumps forward, eyes wide.

EDMUND (cont'd)
The Stone Table. The Beaver said
something about the Stone Table.
That Aslan was there.

The Fox drops his head. The Witch turns, surprised.

WHITE WITCH
Thank you Edmund. I’m glad these
poor creatures were able witness
some honesty.

Edmund sags.

“WHITE WITCH \(cont/d)
Before they die.

SHE BRINGS THE WAND. DOWN, PIERCING THE WOODEN TABLE. ‘THE
ANIMALS SCREAM AS THE MAGIC RADIATES OUTWARD.

EDMUND
NO!

Edmund watches ‘in horror as the squirrels and satyrs TURN TO
STONE. Fox gives one last growl, then goes marble.

The Witch slaps Edmund, then grabs his face harshly.

WHITE WITCH
Think about which side you‘re on
Son of Adam. Mine...
(twists his head around)
...or theirs.

The Witch turns to MAUGRIM AND HIS LIEUTENANT.
WHITE WITCH (cont’d)
They‘11 try and make for the River.
Gather your swiftest wolves.
She turns to Edmund and tousles his hair.
WHITE WITCH (contd)

Little Edmund misses his family.
Don't you, dear?

Edmund just stares, devastated.

90 EXT. NARNIA, FOREST NEAR RIVER ~ DAY 90

The Pevensies follow the Beavers through a sparse forest.
Around them, water drips from THAWING ICICLES.

Lucy
I wonder if the Professor had any
galoshes in his wardrobe.
SUSAN'S FOOT SINKS IN A PUDDLE. She yanks it out, all soggy.
SUSAN
I'd be happy to go back and get
them.
The Beavers stop, absolutely still.

MR. BEAVER
Quiet.

The children listen. Then they all hear.it...RUNNING WATER.

91 EXT. GREAT REVER, CLIFF - DAY | 91
The group stands on.a precipice, staring down at...

THE GREAT RIVER. Cracks run along its frozen surface. Dark
green water shoots “underneath.

{TO THEIR LEFT, A MASSIVE FROZEN WATERFALL looms, huge chunks
of ice cracking off.

TO THEIR RIGHT, THE RIVER FLOWS. Plates of ice break away,
shooting downstream.

SUSAN
Our shortcut is melting.

Lucy stares down the rocky slope to the jagged ice.

LUCY
What do we do?

Peter’s eyes flick from shore to shore, calculating.

PETER
We cross.

SUSAN
We'll never make it.

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 76.

Peter adjusts his shield and sword, looking steely.

PETER
Not if we keep talking about it.

Peter scrambles down the hill. After a beat, the others
follow. The Beavers look at each other, worried.
EXT. NARNIA, FOREST NEAR RIVER - DAY 92

A SULLEN GROWL cuts the air. MAUGRIM steps out of the
shadows, sniffing SUSAN‘S FOOTPRINT.

More wolves prowl out behind him.

EXT. GREAT RIVER — DAY 93
PETER’S BEATEN BROWN SHOE steps onto the ice. It crackles.
Beaver looks up at him.

MR. BEAVER
Maybe I ought to go first.

Tentatively,. Beaver leads them onto the surface of the river.

THE ICE GROANS OMINOUSLY.

 

Susan grips Lucy’s hand. She glares at Peter.

- SUSAN
-Tf<Mum knew what you were doing...

PETER
Mum’s not here.

A CRACK RIPS OPEN behind them. Icy water sprays.

EXT. GREAT RIVER, CLIFF - DAY 94
Far below, FIVE TINY FIGURES slip across the ice.

Maugrim and his pack prowl onto the cliff. He looks from the
children below to the WATERFALL above them.

MAUGRIM
Vardan, you're with me. The rest
of you remain here.

VARDAN
Captain?
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 77

MAUGRIM
I’m not losing them again.

MAUGRIM HEADS TOWARD THE FALLS. Vardan follows reluctantly.

EXT. GREAT RIVER — DAY 95
Beaver presses ahead of the others, testing the ice.
Susan slips, landing on Mrs. Beaver‘s tail.

MRS. BEAVER
Ouch.

SUSAN
Sorry.

Suddenly, A HUGE ICE CHUNK PLUMMETS from the waterfall,
SMASHING THROUGH to the water below.

Lucy looks up, white-faced.

LUCY
Oh, no.

Everyone turns to-see...A PAIR OF WOLVES picking their way
across the waterfall.

Peter watches’ the wolves drop down onto the opposite shore,
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM.

Maugrim and Vardan tear at. them across the ice.
PETER FUMBLES , “AWKWARDLY DRAWS HIS SWORD.
VARDAN PEELS AWAY AND CUTS BEAVER OFF, TEETH BARED.

MRS, BEAVER
No!

MAUGRIM CORNERS THE OTHERS.
MAUGRIM
Put that down, boy. Someone could
get hurt.
He glances toward Beaver. Vardan nips at Beaver's flesh.

MR. BEAVER
Never mind me! Kill him!

Peter swallows. Maugrim snarls.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 78.

MAUGRIM
This isn’t your fight. Go home and
you can take your brother with you.
Go forward and you’ll feel my
teeth.
Peter's numb hand squeezes the hilt.

MR. BEAVER
Peter! Run him through!

Vardan snaps at Beaver, knocking him down.
Peter pokes tentatively with his sword, scared.

Maugrim advances, smiling savagely. Peter backs up. He
shoots a desperate glance at Beaver.

MR. BEAVER (cont'd)
Narnia needs you, Peter. Gut him
while you still have a chance!

SUSAN
Hurry!

Just then, ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK TUMBLES from the waterfall.
Lucy looks up. Her eyes go wide.

at Lucy
Peter!

Peter turns to see PISSURES splitting across the waterfall’s
frozen surface.

He looks from the waterfall to the wolf. Resigned, he STARTS
TO LAY DOWN HIS SWORD. Maugrim grins.

MAUGRIM
You're even a bigger coward than
your brother.

Peter freezes. He stares straight into Maugrim’s yellow
eyes...AND RAISES HIS SWORD.

PETER
(to Susan)
HOLD ON TO ME!
Susan grabs Peter’s coat, taking Lucy with her other hand.
PETER BRINGS HIS SWORD DOWN, DRIVING IT INTO THE ICE.
MAUGRIM'S YELLOW EYES GO WIDE.

EXT. GREAT RIVER, DOWNSTREAM -— DAY 96
An ice chunk bobs in the water, then turns over...

REVEALING PETER STILL HOLDING ONTO THE SWORD. Susan and Lucy
sputter beside him, desperately hanging on.

Further down, Maugrim and Vardan paddle vainly, but the
current washes them downstream.

The Beavers swim through the water to the floating berg.
They dig their claws into the ice, pushing toward the shore
EXT. GREEN CLEARING - DAY 97
THREE OVERCOATS HANG FROM A TREE BRANCH.

In the distance, the group trudges: up a damp foothill,
HEADING EAST. :
Peter and Beaver walks in silence. Finally:

MR. BEAVER:

That was stupid. You could've
gotten everyone killed.

PETER
I felt pretty sure you could swim.

MR. BEAVER
It’s not me I'm worried about! Why
didn’t you kill that wolf when you
had the chance?
THEY PASS A BUDDING TREE. Peter and Beaver don’t notice.

PETER
I tried.

Susan whips around.
SUSAN
He saved your life! You should be
thanking him!

Peter looks at her, surprised.

Beaver stops, furious.
MR. BEAVER
Don‘t any of you understand? No
one life is worth the entire future
of Narnia! Not even mine. If
these kids don’t shape up, this
winter is never going to end.

MRS. BEAVER
Um, Beaver...

He looks at her. She points.
ALL AROUND THEM, NARNIA ERUPTS IN LIFE AND COLOR.
Beaver jumps back as YELLOW TULIPS BURST FROM THE EARTH.
Mrs. Beaver just smiles and takes his paw.
MRS. BEAVER (cont'd)

Now, let’s all calm down. We're

nearly there.
EXT. GREAT RIVER, CLIFF - DAY 98

Ginarrbrik. and The’ Witch stand with the remaining wolves,
watching as...THE RIVER FLOWS CLEAR. NOT A TRACE OF ICE.

GINARRBRIK
So...warm out’.

 

He starts to” emove his coat. The Witch shoots him a look.
He puts the..coat back on.

Ginarrbrik (cont‘d)
I’ll go get the sleigh.

The Witch stares out at the burgeoning countryside: grasses
wave, flowers burst to life.

A BUTTERFLY swoops near her head. She turns it to stone. It
land in the mud with a THUP.

GINARRBRIK (0.S.) (cont'd)
Your Majesty?

She turns to see Ginarrbrik atop the sled, scratching his
chin.

Ginarrbrik (cont'd)
There seems to be something wrong
with the sleigh.

THE REINDEER‘S HOOVES STICK IN MUD. THE SLED'S RUNNERS SINK.

WHITE WITCH
Then we walk.

GINARRBRIK
And the animals?

WHITE WITCH
Leave the reindeer. Pack the mule.

Ginarrbrik nods. He walks to the rear of the sleigh where...

EDMUND lies bound to the runners, gagged and caked in mud.

GINARRBRIK
You heard her, mule. Saddle up.

99 EXT. THE STONE TABLE - DAY

THE STONE TABLE RISES AGAINST THE SKY. The great grim gray

slab rests on four upright stones.
Slowly, FIVE SHADOWS CREEP UP.

It's huge.

THE PEVENSIES AND BEAVERS GAZE IN AWE AT THE MONOLITH.
“MR. BEAVER
I’ve heard about it ever since I
was a boy.

MRS. BEAVER
But seeing it...

She trails off, just gaping. Beaver takes her hand.
ANCIENT RUNES COVER EVERY INCH OF THE TABLE.

PETER
Is that...writing?

Mrs. Beaver runs her paw along it.
MRS. BEAVER
Those runes are from the dawn of
time.

Susan glances around sceptically.

I’d-have to say Aslan isn‘t here.
Peter shoots Beaver a look. Beaver’s smiles fades.
LUCY (0.8.)
He’s not...
Lucy smiles, standing at the edge of the plateau.
LUCY (cont‘d)
He’s down there.
Everyone rushes over to see...
A BUSTLING ENCAMPMENT at the foot of the hill. Flags flap in
the breeze. HUNDREDS OF CREATURES gather around a PAVILION.
Beaver chuckles and pats Peter on the back.
MR. BEAVER
What'd I.tell you? Knew it all
along.
100 EXT. WHITE WITCH'S CAMP ~ DAY 100

Edmund struggles’ under .a-dozen satchels. He drops one.
Ginarrbrik WHIPS him across the legs.

The Witch stops beneath A BLACK AND TWISTED TREE. She peers
up. DARK, SLIMY PODS hang from the branches.

Edmund watches, puzzled as she pokes at one of the pods.

WHITE WITCH
You there. Wake up.

For a moment, nothing happens. Then:

HARPIE
Hello, my Queen.

EYES appear on the pod, hollow and mean.

WHITE WITCH
Go to General Otmin in the Wild
Northern Woods. Tell him to break
camp and meet me here.
101

102

Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 83.

HARPIE
Yes, my Queen.

The POD unfolds, revealing AN INCUBUS. It extends its
leathery wings and flies away over the tree tops-

WHITE WITCH
All of you! Spread word to my
faithful. If it’s a war Aslan
wants, then a war he shall get.
Edmund swallows, staring fearfully as DOZENS OF OTHER PODS
take flight.
EXT. GREAT RIVER, FAR DOWNSTREAM - DAY 101

A FROG bounds along the muddy bank. Suddenly, a PAW bursts
from the water and SQUISHES the frog.

MAUGRIM climbs out of the river. VARDAN collapses beside
him. They pant on the bank, ribs showing through matted fur.
EXT. ASLAN‘S CAMP, QUTSKIRTS - DAY 102
A HORSE bends low, drinking from A STREAM.

Suddenly, A TWIG SNAPS.

The horse spins, revealing not a horse but...A CENTAUR. It
stares in shock at...

{THE PEVENSIES AND BEAVERS standing at the stream’s edge.
Slowly, the little party steps forward.

Susan freezes as they cross the stream. A PAIR OF NAIADS
RISE FROM THE WATER. They smile and bow.

As the humans and Beavers enter the camp, musicians stop
playing. A hush settles, and then...A FLURRY OF WHISPERS.

THE CROWD PARTS BEFORE THE PEVENSIES, then gathers behind,
following them. They move towards:

A REGAL TENT. THE FLAP HANGS CLOSED.
All the creatures go SILENT. Peter and Susan look up at

A GOLDEN BANNER RIPPLING IN THE WIND, EMBLAZONED WITH A
CHARGING RED LION.

Suddenly, LUCY GASPS.

In the now open tent stands a FEARSOME, BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN...
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 84,

LION. He gazes at them. His mane shimmers.

Lucy stares for a moment...then KNEELS. The Beavers drop to
all fours, bowing their heads.

Aslan lets out a long, low PURR.
Peter and Susan awkwardly go down on one knee.
Beaver leans over to Peter.

MR. BEAVER
Go on.

PETER
No. After you.

MR. BEAVER
Sons of Adam before animals.

Peter looks at Susan.

PETER
Ladies first.

“SUSAN
You’re the eldest.

Peter frowns. Uncertainly, he rises and lifts his sword in
salute, unsure of what to say.

Lucy stands.

Lucy
Please Aslan, we've come for your
help...

Aslan looks at them with solemn eyes, taking in each child.

ASLAN
Welcome Peter, Son of Adam.
Welcome Susan and Lucy, Daughters
of Eve. Welcome Beavers. You have
done well.
(knowingly)
But...where is the fourth?

PETER
That's why we're here, sir.

Aslan looks at him curiously.
PETER (cont'd)

Edmund's been captured. By the
White Witch.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 85.

MR. BEAVER
(coughs, speaks up)
He betrayed them, your Majesty.

A noble CENTAUR, OREIUS, head of Aslan‘s guard steps forward.

OREIUS
Then he has betrayed us all.
ASLAN
Peace Oreius!
PETER
It's not his fault. I was too hard

on him.
Susan steps up beside Peter.
SUSAN
We both were. But he was acting
rotten.

Peter smiles at her support.

ASLAN
‘Then why do you want him back?

The children gape;. surprised.

. LUCY
Because he’s our brother....

THE LION STARES AT THE LITTLE GIRL. SHE MEETS HIS GAZE.
Finally, ASLAN PURRS. “ .

Be at peace, dear one.

Lucy looks up at the giant Lion.
ASLAN (cont'd)
All shall be done for Edmund. But
it may be harder than you think.
103 EXT. WHITE WITCH’S CAMP — DAY 103

Edmund sags, roped to a tree. A drop of blood rolls from his
mouth.

Ginarrbrik walks away from the tree, chuckling. At small
fires, shadowy MINIONS conspire, sharpening their weapons.

At the far end, THE WITCH obsessively rubs a smudge of dirt
from her hand. She doesn’t look up.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 86

WHITE WITCH
How is our captive?

GINARRBRIK
He‘ll recover.

THE WITCH PLUCKS UP GINARRBRIK AND HURLS HIM AGAINST A TREE.
Harpies scatter, cackling. Ginarrbrik groans.

WHITE WITCH
You have enjoyed my good graces for
many years, Ginarrbrik. Those
graces are not without limits.
Ginarrbrik looks up, fearful.
WHITE WITCH (cont‘d)
That boy will die as tradition
demands it. On the Stone Table.
She stalks away.
WHITE WITCH (cont‘d)
Interfere with that, and I will
drain you dry.
A harpy giggles. Ginarrbrik takes a swipe at. it. It jumps
away.
104 EXT. “ASLAN ’S CAMP, OUTSKIRTS - DAY 104

LUCY (0.8.)
Oh, come on, try it on.
105 EXT. ASLAN‘S CAMP, RIVER - DAY 105

SUSAN DRIES FROM HER WASH. TWO DRYADS hold a ROBE out. Lucy,
already dressed in Narnian silks, gives Susan a shove.

They wrap Susan in the cloak, turning her toward a NAIAD THAT
FORMS WATER INTO A VERTICAL MIRROR SURFACE. Susan gapes at
her own reflection: A NARNIAN LADY.

SUSAN
Oh.

LUCY
Or maybe you’d prefer your school
uniform.

SUSAN

No...this is fine.

EXT. ASLAN'S CAMP, KNOLL - DAY 106

ASLAN’S PAW sinks into the earth. Walking behind, Peter puts
his foot inside Aslan’s print. It dwarfs his little shoe.

Atop the ridge, they look east: GREEN LAND ROLLS TO A
GLISTENING SEA. A CASTLE GLITTERS LIKE A WHITE DIAMOND.

ASLAN
That is Cair Paravel, the castle of
the four thrones, in one of which
you must sit.

PETER
Why me?

ASLAN
Narnia, dis founded’ on.a Deep Magic
more powerful than either of us. It
dictates ‘that now, as in the
beginning, it must be a Man who
sits as High King.

 

Aslan looks at Peter, his huge eyes taking in the boy.

ASLAN (cont‘d)
And that man is you.

Peter looks away, shaking his head.

PETER
Aslan...I'm not who you think I am.

ASLAN
Are you the one to decide that?

PETER
But I'm no King. And I'm certainly
not a hero. I can’t even keep my
family safe.

ASLAN
You‘ve brought Susan and Lucy
safely this far.

PETER '
But Edmund-

ASLAN

Is another matter. Peter, I will

do what I can to help save your

Susan models a gown in the Naiad mirror. Her smile becomes
slightly sad.

SUSAN
Mum hasn’t had a dress like this
since before the war.
Lucy looks at her in the liquid mirror.

The girls whirl.
MAUGRIM (cont'd)
We're tired and we'd prefer to kill
you quickly.
Susan backs up. Lucy's eyes swivel to her sister, terrified.

LUCY
Susan. The horn.

Susan's hand goes to her dress. THE HORN'’S NOT THERE. She
looks across the tent to HER OLD SKIRT...and THE HORN.

Vardan advances, baring his yellow teeth.

Lucy sprays the PERFUME ATOMIZER, in his face. He staggers
back, blinking and sneezing.

Susan runs. Maugrim peels after her. She dodges. The wolf
SMASHES THOUGH THE MIRROR, WHICH FALLS BACK TO WATER.

Susan snatches up the horn. She fumbles it to her lips.

CUT AND BLEEDING, MAUGRIM CLOSES IN.

EXT. ASLAN’S CAMP, KNOLL ~ DAY o 108
Peter and Aslan walk down the hill toward the camp.
Suddenly, A HORN BLAST SHAKES THE AIR.

ASLAN:
It's your sister's horn.

Peter freezes. Aslan looks calmly at him, waiting. Peter
clenches his teeth...THEN TAKES OFF DOWN THE HILL.

Aslan follows.

EXT. ASLAN’S CAMP, RIVER — DAY 109
LUCY clings to the trunk of a tree, reaching down for
SUSAN, who hangs from a lower branch.

MAUGRIM and VARDAN snap at her feet. A torn piece of Susan's
robe hangs from Maugrim’s teeth.

Peter rushes in, sword drawn. Maugrim spins. Seeing Peter,
he snarls in delight.

Aslan, Oreius and his men arrive. Vardan' backs away.
Maugrim circles Peter.

MAUGRIM
Give it up, boy. We both know you
haven’t got it in you.
Peter grasps his sword.
Oreius pulls his weapon. Aslan checks him with a growl.
ASLAN
No, let the young Prince fight this
battle.
Maugrim snaps his jaws.
MAUGRIM
You should have killed me when you
had the chance.

HE LEAPS, ALL TEETH. Peter cringes, gripping his blade. THE
WOLF FALLS UPON THE BOY.

LUCY
Peter!

They roll on the ground and-then...LIE STILL.
EVERYONE STARES.

Suddenly, Peter shoves Maugrim off. The wolf flops over,
PETER’S SWORD.STICKING OUT OF HIS RIBS.

Vardan flees into the forest. Aslan turns to Oreius and
points into the woods.

ASLAN
Follow him, he‘1l lead you to his
mistress.
Oreius gallops off, followed by a squad of centaurs.

Susan and Lucy climb down and join Aslan where Peter stares
at the lifeless wolf.

Peter pulls out his bloody sword.

Peter. Clean your sword.

Peter looks down at his dripping blade. He quickly wipes it
off on the grass.

SUSAN
Ed-

Susan takes a step forward, but Peter lays a hand on her arm.
Centaurs surround Edmund, solemn.

LUCY BOLTS through the line of guards and throws herself into
her brother’s arms. He barely has time to react before:

ASLAN (0.S.)
Edmund.
Markus & McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 94.

ASLAN steps out of his tent, his face grave.
Lucy looks sadly at Edmund. She mouths the word:

There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.
They stare at their brother. Edmund clears his throat.

EDMUND
Hello.

Lucy hugs him again. This time, he squeezes her back.

Are you alright?

He looks toward Aslan.

And I’m sure they’ll pack something
up for us when we go.

Lucy looks up from her eggs.

LUCY
Go where?

SUSAN
Back to the lamp-post. We could be
home in a couple of days.

Everyone stops. Susan shifts in her seat.

SUSAN (cont'd)
Well, now that we’ve got Edmund
back-

LUCY
But we can’t leave now!

Peter turns from the flap and faces his family.

: © PETER |
Aslan didn't rescue Edmund so we
could just abandon Narnia.

SUSAN
It’s a war, Peter.

She looks to Edmund for support.

SUSAN (cont'd)
Edmund already nearly lost his
life! What are we supposed to do?

EDMUND
Whatever we can.

They all look surprised. Edmund puts his fork down, grave and
serious.

helped her do it.

Lucy takes Edmund's hand. Peter turns to Susan.

PETER
Ed’s right. We have to do our
part.

SUSAN
Does our part include getting
killed?

PETER
We just have to make sure it
doesn't.

The tent grows quiet.
After a long moment, Susan stands,

SUSAN
I guess that’s it then.

LUCY
Where are you going?

She takes her BOW AND QUIVER from a hook.
SUSAN :
fo get in some practice.

SUSAN pulls her bow tight and lets fly...MISSING THE TARGET

Susan shoots...STICKING HER ARROW IN THE EDGE OF THE TARGET.
Lucy hands over another arrow.

Across the field, Edmund wobbles unsteadily atop a BROWN
HORSE.

EDMUND
Whoa, there. Horsie.

The horse rolls its eyes.

BROWN HORSE

A few feet away, Peter stares, uncertain.

Are you sure about this?

A SLEEK WHITE UNICORN goes down on his knees.

UNICORN
It would be an honor, my lord.

Peter and Edmund go thundering by on their steeds.

Susan aims and...NAILS THE TARGET JUST OFF CENTER. She nods
with satisfaction...

UNTIL A TINY DAGGER FLIES IN AND STICKS THE BULLSEYE. Lucy
smiles innocently.

Peter and Edmund thunder past, INSTRUCTED by TWO CENTAURS.
Edmund holds his sword high, smiling.

Bow down or taste steel.

Peter laughs and charges, meeting Edmund's sword with his.

CENTAUR

Peter's HORSE REARS to avoid crushing Beaver.

PHILIP
Watch out, Beaver!

Nobody knows. But Aslan has agreed
to see her on condition she comes

FOUR CYCLOPS CARRY A BIER. ATOP RIDES THE WITCH, GLEAMING IN
WHITE FUR.

BEHIND HER, A PHALANX OF MINOTAURS MARCHES IN LOCKSTEP.

Peter and Lucy scowl. Susan puts her hand on Edmund. He
doesn’t shake it off.

ASLAN’S ARMY rumbles with an uneasy snarl.
Ginarrbrik runs ahead of the procession. He cups his hands.
GINARRBRIK
Jadis, Queen of Narnia! Empress of
the Lone Islands-
ASLAN'S ARMY ROARS IN PROTEST, DROWNING HIM OUT.
The cyclops lower the Witch down, right in front of...

ASLAN, who waits with the Pevensies under his flag. The Lion
raises his paw for silence. The growling dies.

The Witch gazes at him...and smiles.
; _ WHITE WITCH .
You have. a traitor amongst you

Edmund swallows.

. ASLAN
His offense was not against you.

: WHITE WITCH
Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?

ASLAN
Don’t cite law to me, witch. I was
there when it was written.
WHITE WITCH
Then you should know it well.
Every traitor belongs to me.
Lucy gasps. Edmund just shuts his eyes.
Beaver growls.

MR. BEAVER
Try and take him then!

ASLAN
Peace, Beaver.

WHITE WITCH

(to beaver)
Do you really think your master can
rob me of my rights by mere force?

(looks at Aslan)
He knows that unless I have blood
as the Law says, all Narnia will be
overturned and perish in fire and
water.

Aslan stares at the Witch, smouldering. She smiles.

WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
You dare not refuse me.

ASLAN
What you say...

Peter apprehensively watches Aslan.

ASLAN (cont‘d)
Is true.

Edmund opens his eyes, devastated. Lucy’s face goes red.
LUCY
It-can’t be true! “How can it be
right to give Edmund to her?
Aslan looks at her sadly.

ASLAN
I didn’t say that it was right.

LUCY
You said you’d help him! You said
he was safe!
The Witch looks sideways at Lucy.
WHITE WITCH
I don't know, Edmund...perhaps I’'11
call off our little bargain.
She swivels slowly to Edmund, mouth stretched in a grin.
WHITE WITCH (cont'd)
They wouldn't have made such good
servants after all.

Edmund‘s face drops. Susan takes her arm away. Peter and
Lucy sag.

Aslan growls.

ASLAN ’
Enough. I shall talk with you
alone.
ASLAN AND THE WITCH WALK INTO HIS TENT.
Everyone turns to Edmund. He wraps his arms around himself.
EDMUND
I said I was sorry.

EXT. ASLAN'S CAMP - DUSK 122

Edmund sits forlornly on the ground, pulling out blades of
grass. Lucy leans on his back, glum.

Susan looks at them, then to Peter, who stares at the tent.
A bee buzzes. A bird chirps. And then...

PETER
They're coming.

All eyes turn to Aslan and the Witch as they exit the tent.
The Witch beams, triumphant.

Aslan stares at. Edmund fora long time, then raises his head
to take in the entire assembly. He finishes on the children.

ASLAN
She* has renounced her: claim on your
brother's blood.
Edmund’s mouth drops open. Peter claps him on the shoulder.
The Witch mounts her bier, then peers down at Aslan.
WHITE WITCH
But how do I know this promise will
be kept?
Aslan's black eyes bore into her. THEN HE ROARS.

The Witch steps back, afraid. She signals to her troops, and
marches away, trying to maintain her dignity

The crowd jeers as she leaves, then rejoices once she’s gone.
Susan hugs a relieved Edmund.

Only Lucy watches Aslan pad sadly into his tent.

Tomorrow will be hard, Peter. Have
no doubt about that.

PETER
I had a thought. If I were the
Witch-

I would enjoy this talk much less,

Peter stops and stares at the deadpan Lion. Aslan‘s whiskers
twitch, then“he smiles. Peter laughs. ”

» ASLAN “(cont'd)
Continue, Son of Adam. I’m sorry.

PETER
If I were the Witch, I might try an
attack during the night. It
happens a lot back home. We‘’d be
safer if our camp was on the other
side of the river.

ASLAN
An idea worthy of a general. But
don’t worry.
Aslan lays a paw on Peter’s shoulder.
ASLAN (cont‘d)

EXT. STONE TABLE HILL - NIGHT 129

Aslan leads the girls up the steep slope. They rest their
hands on his fur. Near the top, he turns.

It is time to return. And, no
matter what, do not let yourselves
be seen by anyone.

LUCY
But, Aslan—

Aslan stops her with a look.

ASLAN .
Thank you, girls. Now go.

With one last look at them, Aslan disappears over the ridge.
Beyond the rise, FIRELIGHT flickers.

Susan looks toward camp, but Lucy gives her a tug. They
crawl toward a scrub bush at the very top.

They peer through the leaves and gasp.

avoiding the sight of...DOZENS OF VILE CREATURES.

FOUR HAGS go out to Aslan. They peer at him, SCARED.
Finally, one pokes the Lion with a bony finger.

The hags break into a cackle.

Aslan just stares at the Witch.

Creatures rush the proud Lion, KNOCKING him over, ROLLING him
onto his back.

his head bleeding from tiny cuts.

They muzzle him, cinching black leather over his mouth.
Ogres lift Aslan onto the Table. Hags bind him to the rock.

A HUSH FALLS OVER THE SCENE.

At last, the Witch climbs atop the Table. She bares her
white arms, drawing from her robes...

A STONE KNIFE.

WHITE WITCH
And now, Aslan, who has won? Did
you really think that by all this
you would save the human traitor?
So the Deep Magic will be appeased,
but when you are dead...what’s to
prevent me from killing him as
well? From killing all of them?

She leans close to Aslan's ear.

from the wounds on his head.

PETER
(commanding)
We're better off meeting them in
the open.

OREIUS
Yes, sir.

Oreius nods respectfully. Peter nods, kingly. The centaur
wheels away.

Then Edmund nudges his brother, whispering. Peter looks down
to see...he’s wearing just one shoe.

EXT. THE STONE TABLE - DAWN 135
The sun waits below the horizon.

Susan and Lucy sit with Aslan’s body. His ropes lie on the
table around him, chewed free.

LUCY
He looks better in the light,
doesn’t he?
Susan watches a column of smoke purl from the camp below.

SUSAN
We need to tell the others.

Lucy strokes the Lion's flank, her voice choking.

LUCY
But...

Lucy bursts into tears. Gently, Susan pulls her away from
the table. Lucy wraps her arms around herself.

LUCY (cont‘d)
I’m so cold.

They walk toward the Eastern slope.
Then A LOW RUMBLE slowly builds.

SUSAN
What ’s-

LUCY
Susan!

CRACK! THE AIR EXPLODES WITH THE SOUND OF THUNDER!

Susan and Lucy pitch to the ground, terrified.

THE WORLD TREMBLES for a few seconds, then subsides, leaving
the hill in silence.

Susan grips the grass. Lucy gets up, slowly. She turns
around and...GASPS.

BEFORE THEM LIES THE STONE TABLE, BROKEN IN TWO, A GREAT
CRACK RUNNING END TO END.

The girls stare up at the jagged rock.

SUSAN
But...why?

LUCY
They've taken Aslan!

SUSAN
But how? Is it more magic?

ASLAN (0.S.)
Perhaps.

They whip around to see...
ASLAN, LARGER, SHINING IN THE SUNRISE, BRIGHTER THAN. GOLD.
The girls tremble with astonishment, then...

i GIRLS
Aslan!

They fling their arms around him, burying their faces in his
fur. Aslan purrs low. Lucy looks up.

LUCY
But weren’t you...?

Aslan licks her forehead.

ASLAN
Not now.

SUSAN
But we saw the knife! We saw you.

ASLAN
While the Witch has a grasp of the
Deep Magic, her knowledge goes back
only to the dawn of time.

Aslan gazes at the rising sun.

ASLAN (cont'd) '
But there is a magic deeper still,
older than Narnia itself, a magic
that goes beyond rules, to truth.

To what is right and what is wrong.

Aslan looks solemnly over to the shattered table.

ASLAN (cont’d)
And it appears that the Witch was
not in the right...

Aslan shakes his mighty mane and ROARS.

The girls gape, thrilled.

EXT. FORDS OF BERUNA — DAWN 136

Peter grips the unicorn’s reins, riding past...HUNDREDS OF
MARCHING NARNIAN TROOPS.

In the middle of the long line, EDMUND RIDES ALONE.

After a moment, Oreius falls alongside. Edmund nods. The
centaur stares straight ahead.

__ ORELUS

Your brother wants you to oversee
the archérs and hold the high
ground.

Edmund looks up, surprised. Oreius marches, stone-faced.

Oreius (cont! da)

He has great faith in you. I
questioned it.

Finally, Oreius turns to the boy.

Oreius (cont’d)
He convinced me.

Oreius stares at him, Edmund swallows. The centaur gives
him a military nod and trots ahead.

Edmund looks away, smiling.

EXT. ASLAN'’S CAMP — DAY 137
Aslan sniffs at a smouldering fire.

Susan and Lucy stare about THE ABANDONED ‘CAMP.

ASLAN (cont‘d)
Peter has led his army to war.

SUSAN
Against her? Against
those...things we saw last night?

ASLAN
It is what I asked of him.

Lucy pulls out her dagger.

LUCY
Then we have to help.

Aslan gently lowers her arm.

ASLAN
We will, dear one. But not that
way.

SUSAN
Then how?

Aslan bends low, stretching out his forepaws.

ASLAN
Climb on and-hold tight. We have
far to go, and little time to get
there.

Tentatively, the girls climb on, gripping the Lion‘s mane.

ASLAN LEAPS, BOUNDING AWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE.

Susan SCREAMS. Lucy LAUGHS.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - MORNING

A CENTAUR HOOF paws the ground.

PETER’S ARMY, five thousand in all, stands nervous but ready.

AN EAGLE SOARS THROUGH A CLOUDLESS SKY, over an open field,

crying a warning to the waiting troops.

It wheels above a rocky outcropping. Below, EDMUND and MR.

BEAVER prepare CENTAURS and DWARF ARCHERS.

The eagle swoops down to PETER and Oreius at the front,

landing on Peter‘’s outstretched arm.

PETER
Soldiers of Aslan! ‘Today, we face

Several bears growl. Peter raises his hand to quiet them.

PETER (cont‘d)
If you wish it, we will go.

A faun scowls, shaking his head.
PETER (cont’d)
If you do not, we would consider it
the greatest honor to stay and
fight by your side.

THE CROWD EXPLODES IN A FIERCE CHEER, BANGING THEIR SWORDS
AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS.

OREIUS
I think you have your answer.

Peter searches the hill behind him. He finds Edmund,
standing with Beaver. Edmund nods, supportive.

Peter lifts his sword, accepting their allegiance.

ACROSS “THE FIELD, THE WITCH SMILES THINLY. Beside her,
Ginarrbrik pulls on his. helmet.

The Witch turns to GENERAL OTMIN.
WHITE WITCH
I‘m not interested in prisoners.
Eradicate them.

OTMIN ROARS. WITH A THUNDER OF HOOVES AND STEEL, THE WITCH'S
ARMY CHARGES.

Peter waits, sword held high.
THE DARK ARMY APPROACHES IN A CLOUD OF DUST.
Finally, Peter swallows and...BRINGS DOWN HIS SWORD.

EAGLES, FALCONS, GRIFFONS and HAWKS take flight, LARGE STONES
gripped in their talons.

Aslan and the girls gallop toward THE WITCH’S CASTLE, now

HER INFANTRY. He signals. “A FLAMING ARROW shoots high.

A PHOENIX strafes the battlefield, disintegrating as it lays
down a WALL -OF ‘FIRE, cutting off the Witch‘’s troops.

Peter’s troops cheer.

But then the Witch drives her chariot right through,
EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE. Her army pours in.

PETER SIGNALS A RETREAT BACK TO THE ROCKS. Riding for
safety, he passes...

Oreius RIDING HARD TOWARD THE WHITE WITCH.

Oreius leaps over her polar bears, swinging at her. She

Then she looks up to see... ,

A TWELVE FOOT STONE GIANT TOWERING OVER HER. Ominous stone
animals fill the courtyard.

The girls look to Aslan, confused and horrified.

ASLAN APPROACHES A STONE UNICORN. He leans forward and...
BREATHES ON ITS FACE.

A WARM GLOW SPREADS OVER THE UNICORN, moving across his
frozen body LIKE A FLAME CATCHING.

Lucy and Susan gape, astounded. All around them, STATUES
COME BACK TO LIFE.

THE STONE TIGER stretches himself awake, Edmund's CHARCOAL
GLASSES AND MUSTACHE still scrawled on his face.

Two nearby DOGS giggle.

ASLAN ROARS in the middle of the courtyard.

Suddenly, A DISTANT CLASH echoes from the ROCKS. A GRYPHON
dives into the skirmish.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ROCKS — DAY 145
THE WHITE WITCH runs down a FAUN, turning him to stone.

EDMUND’S ARCHERS take down one of her POLAR BEARS, throwing
the WHITE WITCH AND Ginarrbrik from the chariot.

OTMIN spies Peter and throws his axe, hitting the unicorn,
knocking Peter from his saddle.

Peter scrambles for his sword but Otmin towers over him.

At the last moment, with its dying breath, the UNICORN
PIERCES OfMIN’S BREAST PLATE.

Peter springs up, only to find himself SURROUNDED BY OGRES.

Across the field, Edmund spies...THE WITCH STALKING STRAIGHT
FOR PETER.

Oblivious, PETER fights on.

EDMUND RUNS, fighting valiantly, vaulting over statues.
The Witch closes in on Peter, his back turned.

SHE RAISES HER WAND. THE TIP SPARKLES.

EDMUND LEAPS, BRINGING HIS SWORD DOWN, SMASHING HER WAND IN
TWO.

Half the wand falls harmlessly to the ground, JUST..A STICK.
Peter spins. —

The Witch stares from the broken wand in her hand...to
Edmund.

HER GREEN EYES GO WIDE. EDMUND TRIES TO ROLL CLEAR.

But with a terrifying SCREAM, she STABS HIM WITH THE JAGGED

His sword clatters across the rocks.

THE WITCH'S EYES POP WIDE TO SEE...

ASLAN, cutting through the throng of the battle, EYES FIXED
RIGHT ON HER.

HE POUNCES...OVER PETER...DRIVING THE WHITE WITCH TO THE

Peter stares, awed and terrified.

A SAVAGE ROAR SHAKES THE LAND. A MOUTHFUL OF TEETH FLASH IN

EDMUND LIES, his fingers grasping at the wand stuck in his
side.

PAN over the weapon-strewn ground to...

Ginarrbrik, lying in the mud, blood seeping from his
forehead. HE STARES AT EDMUND, EYES RED WITH HATE.

The dwarf’s gnarled hand reaches out and grips AN AXE. He
drags himself to his feet.

HIS SHADOW falls over the helpless Edmund. The boy's eyes
flutter, then freeze with fear.

Above him, Ginarrbrik bares his black teeth and RAISES THE
AXE.

ACROSS THE FIELD, the other Pevensies search frantically.
SUDDENLY, SUSAN SEES SOMETHING OVER PETER’S SHOULDER.

: SUSAN (cont’d)
DOWN!

Peter drops, as: Susan WHIPS AN ARROW FROM HER QUIVER.
SHE LETS FLY.
Ginarrbrik starts to swing his axe, then STOPS.

He looks down: THE POINT OF AN ARROW PROTRUDES FROM HIS
SHOULDER. HE TOPPLES OVER, INCAPACITATED.

Peter, Susan and Lucy race over.

Susan cradles Edmund's head. Peter stares at his wounds.
They both turn to Lucy.

She fumbles and produces the TINY CRYSTAL VIAL. She drops to
her knees and unstops the bottle.

ONE GLISTENING DROP splashes onto Edmund's lips.

Edmund's ragged breath becomes regular. After a moment, his
eyes open. He smiles, weak but alive.

Lucy hugs him for a long time.

LUCY

Aslan gives a low growl.
ASLAN
Daughter of Eve, there are others
at the point of death. Must more
people die for Edmund?
Lucy swallows. She and Susan share a long look.

LUCY
I’m sorry.

Lucy hurries to help a fallen centaur.
Aslan moves on, breathing life back into the frozen statues.

Edmund struggles to his feet, honored.

EXT. GREAT EASTERN SEA SHORE - DAY 154
Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy walk on either side of Aslan.
Behind them, the victorious army marches, jubilant.

She sits in her-throne, tentative. Then she looks down to
find A BEAUTIFULLY CARVED FOOT-REST, JUST HER SIZE.

THE PEVENSIES SIT GRANDLY UPON THEIR THRONES.
Narnians crowd the hall, gazing happily. They part as...

Aslan enters. He stops in front of the children. After a
long, proud moment, he nods.

MR. TUMNUS pins a SILVER LAUREL to Lucy's hair.

hops as the BEAVERS waltz by, their tails sweeping the floor.

Creatures gather around the feasting table.

Edmund loads his plate. Suddenly, he freezes. Before him
sits a big platter of...TURKISH DELIGHT.

He reaches out.

Just then, LUCY WHISKS IT AWAY. They share a grin.

Through the dancers, LUCY NOTICES A GOLDEN FIGURE SLIPPING

Down below, Aslan walks along the shore...away from Cair

LUCY
Is he coming back?

She watches Aslan grow smaller and smaller.
MR. TUMNUS
In time. One day you’ll see him
and another you won’t. It’s all
right. He'll often drop in. But
you mustn’t press him.
They both stare out at the Lion retreating in the distance.

MR. TUMNUS (cont'd)
After all, he’s not a tame lion.

LUCY
But he is good.

Lucy’s eyes well up with tears. Tumnus offers her HIS
HANDKERCHIEF.

MR. TUMNUS
Here, you need it more than I do.

Finally, Aslan disappears into the darkness, leaving
only...HIS DEEP FOOTPRINTS IN THE WET SAND.

THE FOOTPRINTS FADE AS THE LIGHT GRADUALLY TURNS TO DAY.

REVERSE TO FIND:

LUCY, NOW A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN, staring over the same stretch
of golden sand. Her silver laurel glints on her head.

A BELL RINGS FROM THE HIGHEST TOWER.
Lucy looks over at a table across the balcony.
MR. TUMNUS, older, stouter, has tea with a FULLY GROWN...
SUSAN, long hair braided beneath her crown of golden flowers.
She smiles up from her embroidery.

The riders burst out to find...THE WHITE STAG GONE. Instead,
there, in the middle of the clearing stands...
Markus « McFeely AA Rev. 12-10-03 Estate Approved. 127.

A METAL POST.

They stop, curious. Peter circles his horse around the pole.

EDMUND
What is this?

SUSAN
Tis’ a tree...of iron.

PETER
But if you look upon it there is a
lantern set atop. What purpose is
this?

LUCY
By likelihood it was placed here
when the trees were fewer.

Peter dismounts, reaching out to touch the pole.
PETER

By the Lion’s mane, it works upon
me strangely.

LUCY
It runs. in my mind also. As if in a
dream.

SUSAN

or a dream of a dream.

The others climb off their horses, letting them graze.
Edmund peers inte the dark wood.

EDMUND
Did anyone see in which direction
our noble prey did go?

A cold wind blows.

SUSAN
Perhaps it did go home. Perhaps the
Great. Wisdom comes in...not
catching it. But going where we
have soft beds and hot food, won't
we then learn all the more
about...the comforts of home?

Edmund and Lucy share an eye-roll.

Just then, THE WHITE STAG bursts from the brush. The four
scramble after it on foot, into the woods.

SUSAN'S HORN hangs from her saddle, left behind.

They stare around, dumbfounded. The Professor looks curiously

The Pevensies look at each other. Slowly, their astonishment

Lucy bites her lip, and opens the door to find...COATS. She

Lucy smiles back. Then she closes the Wardrobe and holds out

Leaving the room dark and quiet. All is still. Then, with a
creak, the Wardrobe door...opens.

And A SHAFT OF GOLDEN LIGHT spills into the room.

FADE OUT.
