EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK

In the darkening recess of an empty lot bordered by a
hillside, TWO 20 YEAR-OLDS lounge against a GOLD BENZ. We‘1l
know them as CHARLIE and OTHER CHARLIE.

Charlie tosses a Vietnamese dice in the air - he knows it as
‘Bua cua ca cop’ - leaving Other Charlie to guess which
animal on the six-sided dice comes up. The game ends as--

An ‘87 Camaro approaches, its heat-inflated tires crackling
over gravel.

DRIVER’S POV: the young men through the windshield; TWO VODKA
MINIATURES in the unseen driver’s palm. He rolls them like a
poker player with his chips, contemplating his move.

Charlie taps his watch - ‘You’re late’ - as
LUDLOW emerges.

He removes his sunglasses, twitching, itching, and squinting
in the setting magenta sun. Bloodshot eyes bleed into
bloodshot skin.

He looks...like a guy who peaked alongside his ‘87 Camaro.

LUDLOW
Konnichiwa.

CHARLIE
What?

LUDLOW
‘Konnichiwa’. Konnichiwa. It means hi.
(waves to Other Charlie)
Hi. Hi. Hii--
(karate chops the air)
--ya! Watch yourself. I had you there.

Ludlow dances about: Muhammad Ali on meth.
LUDLOW

You guys need any Tina? You partying
later? It’s free if you do it with me.

CHARLIE
Lower your fucking mouth and open the
trunk.

LUDLOW

Okay, don’t decide right now.

Ludlow begins to open the trunk, then suddenly SLAMS it--
LUDLOW
The money!! What about the money?

The younger men’s nerves are fraying. Other Charlie lifts
his shirt - a STACK tucked into the waistband of his sags.

LUDLOW
Alright, business first. Check this
American sword...

Ludlow opens the trunk, revealing a massive 50 CAL. MACHINE-
GUN. They all stare at it.

OTHER CHARLIE
The fuck is that? We said machine guns...

LUDLOW
It is a machine gun.

Other Charlie tries to wedge it out of the trunk.

CHARLIE
The kind you can carry.

LUDLOW
I couldn’t get any of those. But this
baby’s from the Vietnam war. She’s got
character. Shit - probably even mowed
down a few of your relations in its day...
Now you can mow down some of mine.

OTHER CHARLIE
(the machine gun)
It’s fucking stuck.

LUDLOW
Okay, tell you what. You double this--

Ludlow reaches into Other Charlie’s jeans for the money - has
his hand SLAPPED away.

LUDLOW
Ow. Fuck. Okay, I’m saying you double
that - I’1l throw in the car. What do
you say? You wanna upgrade?

CHARLIE
Nigger I drive a Mercedes fucking Benz.
And if I want your faggot-ass ride I’ll
take it.

Other Charlie stands next to his friend, viciously still.
OTHER CHARLIE
And Konnichiwa’s not Vietnamese.

LUDLOW
Jeez, sorry Charlie. How’m I supposed to
tell?

OTHER CHARLIE
What’s that now?

Ludlow finds himself BACKING AWAY from them.

LUDLOW
What? I’m just saying it’s confusing.
You got eyes like apostrophes, but you
dress white, talk black, and drive Jew.
(pleading for a laugh)
Right? What? Right?

They JUMP HIM.

LUDLOW
Wait, no, don’t, no, no!!

Ludlow takes a terrible beating, FISTS and BOOTS into his
face and torso. His KEYS are ripped from his clutch.

CHARLIE
Dumb fucking tweak.
(one last kick; then)
Go, let’s go!

BOTH CARS spin out, spraying gravel over Ludlow. He lies
still, gasping in the dark.

Then, painfully, he sits up. Feels his ear. Blood draining
out. He needs an ambulance.

Instead, he gets to his feet...straightens his hair...re-
buttons his shirt...and starts walking.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

TWO RANCID PROSTITUTES loiter, one of them dressed as a
nurse. Ludlow limps past them to a PAYPHONE.

Drops in a quarter, dials a number. Outside the booth, the
non-nurse approaches the glass. She smiles - showing off fake
mangled teeth - and points lazily to Ludlow’s bloody face--

PROSTITUTE
(her friend)
She’s a nurse.
Ludlow turns away from the bizarre scene as someone picks up
his call. He simply says:

LUDLOW
Where?

EXT. LITTLE SAIGON - NIGHT

Moths rattle inside broken, blinking streetlights.
Underneath, it’s HALLOWEEN. COSTUMED CHILDREN run between
vietnamese gardens to cramped homes - a patchwork of colors.

Ludlow stalks through the dark night, crossing down a squared-
off road. He spots a 10 YEAR-OLD DARTH VADER sitting on a
bike. And Darth, not trick-or-treating, spots him.

Ludlow CHARGES the young ‘look-out’, scooping him off his
bike and scooping a PAGER from the boy’s hands. Ludlow reads
the pager as the boy kicks him furiously.

LUDLOW
(in Vietnamese)
Go home.

Ludlow looks ahead, stalking further down the DEAD END STREET...

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Ludlow scurries to HIS CAR, parked at the curb of a SHABBY
HOUSE. In the crumbling driveway, the GOLD BENZ glints.

Pulling keys from his pocket with bruised fingers, Ludlow
quietly unlocks his trunk. The MACHINE GUN IS GONE, but he
pulls back the base mat, revealing a LOW-JACK tracking device.

We glimpse a few other toys as well: a 9MM, FOUR CLIPS, a
KEVLAR VEST...

Ludlow looks back down the street - no sign of backup...
Looks at his watch... Looks back at the house...
INT. HOUSE - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow follows his 9MM inside. A 16 YEAR-OLD sits frozen,
X-Box controller in hand.

LUDLOW
(whispers)
Where’s she at?
The X-Boxer shakes his head. He may not know, he may not
understand, but he’s definitely about to piss himself.

Ludlow makes a ‘keep playing’ motion, scoping out a BACK
ROOM. He POINTS down the hall, then holds up two fingers:
‘Two of them back there?’

The scared X-Boxer holds up two fingers - as if simply imitating
Ludlow - then two more on his other hand: ‘FOUR of them.’

Ludlow steels himself - that’s more than he bargained for.
He graciously reopens the front door, allowing the scared kid to
scamper out.

DOWN THE HALLWAY,

Ludlow steps carefully... We hear CHATTER from inside the BACK
ROOM. Ludlow opens the door, unnoticed, to find FOUR MEN
huddled around his 50. CAL MACHINE GUN like kids at Christmas.

LUDLOW
Charlie. Other Charlies...
(ignoring the gun)
Where’s she at?

The men are taken completely by surprise. But they stay quiet.
They’re calculating... Four of them, only one Ludlow...

Ludlow FIRES low, kneecapping his pal Charlie. Everybody’s
TALKING now - in Vietnamese.

LUDLOW
English! Answer me!

FIFTH CHARLIE’S POV: through a back screen door, a shaking
SLG-SAUER PISTOL steadies on Ludlow. The FIFTH MAN pulls the
trigger--

 

BLAM!! Ludlow is SHOT in the back shoulder; he’s thrown
violently down the HALLWAY FLOOR.

Ludlow cranes back, RETURNING FIRE and dropping the Fifth
Charlie. He rolls onto his back, CUTTING DOWN Other Charlie
when his parking-lot-friend charges.

Strangely, no one else emerges. Ludlow lifts himself up,
grimacing and gasping for breath. He re-enters

THE BACK ROOM

finding only Charlie, MOANING on the floor. TWO MEN MISSING.
Ludlow listens - his only play - but Charlie’s MOANS drown
everything out. Ludlow taps Charlie in the head - BLAM! - then
concentrates in the quiet...
A FAINT SOUND draws him to a CLOSET... Inside, he finds a

DOOR IN THE FLOOR... Ludlow peers down the dark hole, shaking
his head. We are way off the page now.

INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Ludlow drops gingerly into the cave. It’s as if he’s just
landed in one of the Viet Cong’s CU CHI TUNNELS. He winds
past a CARD TABLE, WEAPONS in a corner, MILITARY DUFFLE BAGS
on tables.

An EXTENSION CORD leads the way down a JAGGED, WINDING
PASSAGEWAY. Ludlow stalks forward... FLEETING SHOUTS ahead.
His walk breaks to a RUN.

He’s rushing in and out of darkness - past AUXILIARY LIGHTS.
He’s gaining on the two voices... Then--

A FACE flashes like a train going the other way...he has just
run past one of the Vietnamese men. He instinctively keeps
running, as bullets lodge into the clay by his ear.

Now Ludlow is caught in between - reloading as he takes fire
from AHEAD and BEHIND.

He’s RETURNING FIRE in both in directions when everything
comes to a grinding halt... Ludlow stands before

a CAGE on the ground.

TWO VIETNAMESE GIRLS, 12 and 14, stare at him through wire
bars in fear-induced wonderment.

Ludlow looks ahead - letting his prey go (we HEAR the
footsteps fade away) - then behind: the footsteps grow LOUDER
until the pursuing thug appears... POP! POP! POP! He snaps
backward as Ludlow pumps three in his chest.

Ludlow walks sullenly back; he drags the body away from the
cage. Ludlow kneels down, eye-to-eye with the cowering girls.

LUDLOW
It’s okay... I’m-- I’m not them.

Words, even gestures, are lost on the children. Exhausted,
Ludlow simply slumps down beside them. He pulls at the
bullet-proof vest chafing his neck... The girls have stopped
erying. They know he won’t hurt them.

And this - to a point - breaks Ludlow down.
EXT. LITTLE SAIGON - A SHORT TIME LATER - NIGHT

+..now the world rolls. A POLICE HELICOPTER shines it’s
belly light on the neighborhood below. Higher up, in less
rarified air, NEWS HELICOPTERS jockey for position.

On the ground, POLICE CARS everywhere. Pockets of ONLOOKERS
painted in the flashing red and blue lights.

In the purgatory between onlookers and the scene, an
attractive FEMALE REPORTER, 30’s, waits with her Channel 9
CAMERAMAN. She looks the part: hair, makeup, get-up - but
there’s a natural beauty beneath.

At the moment, she’s transfixed by Ludlow. He’s standing by
a window - inside the dealers’ house - answering TWO MEN.

CAMERAMAN
It’s Wander.

MEGAN turns to find LIEUTENANT TERRY WANDER (50’s, tall - even
a little dashing) cutting through the fray towards the scene.
She scurries next to him--

MEGAN
Lieutenant, anything you can tell us?
Or tell me? We were here twenty minutes
before the rest--

WANDER
(calmly)
Hi Megan.
MEGAN
Hi.
(then)

Just a few words? On camera?

WANDER
What are you thinking so far?

MEGAN
L.A. cops take down sex ring.

WANDER
Anything on systems, teamwork?

MEGAN
A coordinated effort, months of planning--

WANDER
Alright, hang around after.
MEGAN
Thank you, Lieutenant.

Wander heads up shabby steps into the house. He cranes back--

WANDER
Trade.

MEGAN
What?

WANDER

Sex trade. Sex ring sounds hinky.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ludlow sits despondently - yet undiminished - beneath TWO
DETECTIVES. DeMILLE is 38, white and running to fat. SHONEY is
36, black and slender. They work the system hard and fast.

SHONEY

What were you doing here Ludlow?
LUDLOW

What?
DEMILLE

You wanna work vice now?
Ludlow is clearly out of his element now, in the aftermath.

LUDLOW
I followed the guns to the girl.

Ludlow watches a STRING of PLAIN-CLOTHED DETECTIVES carrying
the MILITARY DUFFLE BAGS out the back door. He locks eyes
with a PIGGISH SERGEANT (CLADY, 50's), directing traffic.
Something not quite right here.

SHONEY
(to Ludlow)
What’s the matter, you need a bracer?
That liquid courage wearing off?

DEMILLE
We had six months into this case, Ludlow.
Could’ve at least given us a call.

SHONEY
Motherfuckin glory hound. That’s all he
is.

Ludlow looks at them for the first time.
LUDLOW
(softly)
What were you doing for six months?

DEMILLE
Fuck you Ludlow!

CLADY
(calling off his dogs)
Hey! Cool it.

Clady’s eyes are on Wander, gliding through the front door.
The Nightwatch Commander assesses the carnage.

WANDER
(grandiosely)
Make me redundant, gentlemen.

(then)
Clady, where’s my boy?

The stocky sergeant, Wander’s ‘second’, points him to Ludlow.

WANDER

There he is.
(to Ludlow)
They reading you the riot act?

SHONEY
Just a few softballs.

WANDER
(to Ludlow)
Why’re you sitting? You hurt?

Ludlow rises awkwardly as Wander looks beyond the men: Other
Charlie lies on the floor, his chest subtly rising.

WANDER

(casually)
Jesus, this one’s still breathing.

(to an aid)
Get a medic in here.

Wander looks exasperatedly at the three men. DeMille gets

his pad and pencil out again.

DEMILLE
You call an ambulance Ludlow?

LUDLOW
No, that’s what I need you for.
10.

WANDER
(peacekeeping)
Alright, you got what you need fellas?

SHONEY
Sure boss.

Wander takes Ludlow under his wing, leading him away. An EMT
crew brushes past, to Other Charlie on the ground.

DEMILLE
You might wanna check for a blood clot.

Something about ‘blood clot’ sets Ludlow off.

LUDLOW
What’d you say?

Wander gets a firm grip on Ludlow’s arm, but says nothing.

DEMILLE
(playing dumb)
What’d I say?

Ludlow holds his temper, easing away.

INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Wander takes Ludlow aside, his aides hanging politely back.

WANDER
(publicly)
Alright...
(privately)
You okay?

Wander’s checking more than Ludlow’s emotional state.

WANDER
Look at me. You did good and you’re in
my show now, so relax.

Ludlow nods at Wander - obviously a shared past between them.

WANDER
Alright, they’re gonna separate you; I’m
having Ridley meet you at the station
right now - let him take your statement;
and--
(searching)
--Oh, forensics is towing your car.

Ludlow winces, eyes on the floor.
ll.

WANDER
Better you don’t drive anyway...
Adrenaline and all that.

LUDLOW
I’m fine.

WANDER
I know you are. Heads up though.
(eye contact)
Megan’s outside.

LUDLOW
So?

WANDER
So take a mint.

One of Wander’s aides hands him a MINER’S LIGHT. A CREW
readies to descend into the TUNNEL--

WANDER
(to all; rousingly)
Alright, who’s coming with me boys?

EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

A UNIFORMED BLACK OFFICER (Mody, 40’s) drapes a blanket over
the teen X-BOXER’S shoulders. He watches a THIRD BODY being
removed from the house...followed by Ludlow. In the black
officer’s eyes - sheer contempt.

MODY
You slowing down, Ludlow?

Ludlow stops, tries to comprehend the intrusion.
MODY
(the bodies)
Just three tonight?
Ludlow SEES the X-Boxer sitting beneath Mody.

LUDLOW
You taking statements now Mody?

MODY
I’m community interface for the victims’
family members.

LUDLOW
Has he given his statement?
12.

Mody stands stubbornly over the boy.

LUDLOW

(to the X-Boxer)
c’mere. No, keep your blanket and c’mere.

Ludlow motions a fellow detective over, handing the boy off.

LUDLOW
(to Mody)
You’re on the wrong side of the yellow
tape, aren’t you?

MODY
I’m right where I belong.

LUDLOW
Mody, give out all the blankets and
lollypops you want, just wait ‘til the
real police work’s done. Okay pumpkin?

MODY
I know how it works Ludlow.
LUDLOW
Well you ever need reminding - I’d be

happy...

Mody stares hatefully as ANOTHER BODY is carted out. Ludlow
SEES it, turns back to Mody and ever so subtly... shrugs.

STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The ‘87 Camaro is hoisted awkwardly by a tow truck. Ludlow
watches, pained.

WOMAN ’S VOICE
(sarcastically)
That's not good for it.

Ludlow turns to find Megan approaching. She smiles prettily--
MEGAN
Miss me? You know sometimes I think

you do these shoot’em-ups just so you
can see me.

Ludlow stares at the CAMERAMAN trailing Megan. He makes a
‘scamper off’ motion with his hand--

LUDLOW
Go ‘way.

The Cameraman knows Ludlow. He’s gone.
13.

MEGAN
Just a few words--
(beating him to the punch)
--besides ‘fuck off’.

LUDLOW
(dismissively)
You gonna pick me up later?

MEGAN
c’mon, your Lieutenant’s giving me
something.

LUDLOW

I’m sure he is.
Megan finally notices, Ludlow’s subtly swaying.

MEGAN
Jesus, are you alright? You’re fucking
shaking.

Ludlow looks at her squarely, willing himself still.

MEGAN
Uncross your arms.

DRIVER’S VOICE
(car door)
It’s open Ludlow.

LUDLOW
(mock scorn)
I really don’t like you this way.

MEGAN
I know. You like me better when I’m
whoring for a story.

Ludlow settles gingerly in the passenger seat.

MEGAN
So? What happened in there?

LUDLOW
It’s just a blur.

She considers Ludlow a moment. Then, coyly--

MEGAN
Well, that’s too bad.
14.

LUDLOW
(warming)
Yeah, why?

MEGAN
Because I really wanted a quote. And...

Ludlow seems to dare Megan to say it - whatever it is -
in front of his listening driver.

MEGAN
Well it’s not going to lick itself, now
is it, Lud?

Ludlow grins...his kind of woman...as he rolls away.

INT. HALLWAY, 77TH STREET COMMUNITY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Ludlow interrupts a RECEPTIONIST with her magazine.

LUDLOW
I’m Tom Ludlow. I’m heading in if
they’re ready.

RECEPTIONIST
(disinterested)
Ready for what?

LUDLOW
I shot some human beings tonight.

RECEPTIONIST
That was you?
(he walks on)
You know where you’re going? Down the
hall--

LUDLOW
(sullenly)
I know the way, honey.

INT. DEPOSITION ROOM, DISTRIC ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

TWO COPS (one of them RIDLEY) and a FEMALE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Make up the ‘shooting team.’ They’re going through the motions
across from a glazed-over Ludlow. They’ve all been here before.

RIDLEY
Point of entry?

LUDLOW
Front door on the north side.
15.

RIDLEY
Okay.
FEMALE D-A.
Why didn’t you call for backup?
LUDLOW
I did.
FEMALE D.A.

Why didn’t you wait for backup?

LUDLOW
In my opinion, there were exigent
circumstances. They had a machine gun
and I believed a felony was taking place
or about to take place.

RIDLEY
Great, great.

DISSOLVE TO:
LUDLOW
I made a point of identifying myself as a
police officer. I then attempted to
detain the four men when I was shot from
the side.

FEMALE D.A.
Which suspect was that?

RIDLEY
Let him finish.

Ludlow looks beyond put out.

LUDLOW
I returned fire. One of the Charlies--

Everyone stops writing, their heads snapping up.
LUDLOW
Excuse me, one of the suspects came out.
I hit him...
DISSOLVE TO:
Ludlow lazily pushes a floor plan sketch back to the D.A.

RIDLEY
Great, great.
16.
LUDLOW
Do you know what time it is?

RIDLEY
Yeah, you’re almost done here.

FEMALE D-A.
You think Internal Affairs will want--?

RIDLEY
Wah, this is all ‘in policy’.

Ludlow’s eyes wander, the lawyers’ voices DRONING OUT...

INT. MEGAN’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ludlow’s alive again - in a state of emergency - as Megan
tears off his jacket, pushing him on to her bed. He HOWLS in
Manageable, laughable pain as she tugs at his belt. He
squirms away from her, retrieving the jacket...

..-in a pocket he finds a VODKA MINIATURE.

MEGAN
Don’t, you already stink.
LUDLOW
You want me to take a shower?
MEGAN
(naughtily)

No.

Ludlow twists it open, savoring the motion. He tilts the
bottle...pouring it down on Megan - a kind of compromise.

Megan pulls him to her, letting him drink from the base of
her neck. His lapping slows, the sexual energy gone...

MEGAN
What happened tonight Lud?

LUDLOW
I can’t tell you.

MEGAN
Fine. You wanna put it all away and pay
for it later...

LUDLOW
No, I can’t ‘cause I promised an exclusive
to that hot bitch on Channel 2.
17.

MEGAN
You’re such a whore.

Ludlow laughs, wincing from the pain.

MEGAN
Come on. Give it to me.

LUDLOW
I’m trying, you won’t shut up.

MEGAN
It’s not just about the story Lud. If

you never talk about anything...you’1l
never make it back to the surface.

A heavy stillness.

LUDLOW
Well let’s help each other. What you
want for what I want.
Megan gets his meaning, even if we don’t yet.

MEGAN
Okay. Why’d you have to shoot?

LUDLOW
They shot me first.

Megan obligatorily removes her bra. Then--

MEGAN
Were they all...Vietnamese?

LUDLOW
No, there were some white kids but I
asked them to leave.

She joylessly reaches into his pants. Then--

MEGAN
Why don’t you ever defend yourself?

LUDLOW
Because I don’t care if people think I’m
a... Whatever they think.
Megan straddles Ludlow; she’s on the verge of tears.

MEGAN
Why do you always go alone?
18.

LUDLOW
Because if anything goes wrong there’s
only my version.

MEGAN
Or you’re dead and gone.

LUDLOW
Either way.

She begins moving on top of him.

MEGAN
Are you waiting for something to go wrong?

Ludlow stares up at Megan...she’s crying now.

LUDLOW
Stop. Jesus, stop it.

Ludlow moves to the edge of the bed, putting on his pants.

LUDLOW
(head killing him)
Awe Jesus, God, Fuck.
(to Megan)
You want some water or something?

MEGAN
I’m gonna spin this your way, Lud.

LUDLOW
Don’t ever spin anything for me. Okay?

Ludlow heads for the door.

MEGAN
I know you’re not this asshole.

Halfway out the door, Ludlow turns back in the PRE-DAWN BLUE
LIGHT.

LUDLOW
Remember how I like you Megan. You’re
not my wife.

Megan absorbs the blow, her eyes - and temper - welling.

MEGAN
Your wife wasn’t even your wife.

Ludlow could go either way; he could leave or he could lose
it... He simply shakes his head, turning away.
19.

MEGAN
Where are you going?

LUDLOW
(low)
Bed.

EXT. PACIFIC DINING CAR RESTAURANT - DAY

Outside the front doors, Mody - the crisply-uniformed black
officer - poses for a picture with a YOUNG BOY.

Arriving groggily at the entrance, Ludlow is forced to wait
several agonizing beats for the boy’s MOTHER to snap the photo.

As Mody waves the admiring boy off, Ludlow heads inside--

LUDLOW
What is it with you and kids?

INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Mody follows inside, towards a PRIVATE DINING AREA:
THIRTY OFFICERS lunching in booths.

MODY
Say that again?

LUDLOW
What? Wo man, I was just kidding around.
(then; sharply)
I just don’t see why the towel boy gets
asked for his picture and autograph.

MODY
You fucking--

Mody stops himself an inch from Ludlow, nostrils flaring.
Ludlow is totally unfazed as Wander sternly motions him over--

WANDER
Lud!

MODY
They shouldn’t let you out in the day,
you know that?

LUDLOW
That’s fine, Mody. You stay outta my
night, I won’t bother you when you’re
liaising in Malibu with your shiny
fucking boots.

(MORE)
20.

LUDLOW (cont'd)
(leaning away)
‘Suspects’ by the way.

MODY
What?

LUDLOW
You called them ‘victims’ the other
night. They had two little girls ina
cage and they’re called ‘suspects’.

MODY
Oh, I’m sure that’s what you call them
in your chummy little booth.

Ludlow passes several booths - notably SHONEY and DEMILLE
among a TIGHT FRATERNITY OF DETECTIVES. He flags a far off
waiter - making the ‘drink’ motion - before dragging a chair
over to Wander, the jovial king among his court.

Across the room is CLADY, the piggish Sergeant running last
night’s crime scene. Clady stands toasting - and roasting -
a RETIRING OFFICER (SILKY).

CLADY
(to all)
-.-and Silky handcuffs the guy’s wrist to
his ankle. So I stand this wino up when
Silky’s not looking, and all of a sudden
he’s coming at Silky like this--

Clady hops on one leg, jabbing with one arm. The room is
ROARING--

CLADY
--and he got a couple shots in!

Clady pulls a CHECK from his jacket over the laughter.
CLADY
So for all your pain and suffering Silk,
here’s a little cushion to go with that
enormous pension you’re coming into.
Wander whispers to Ludlow under the noise--
WANDER
(re: Mody)
What was he - getting your measurements?

Ludlow flags a waiter, signalling for a drink.

LUDLOW
For what?
21.

CLADY
Hats off to Silky boys!

ALL THE OFFICERS stand.

ALL
Hats off to Silky!
WANDER
(to Ludlow)
Your fucking coffin, that’s what.
CLADY
(the check)

That’s from everybody in this room!
The tables return to separate, boisterous conversation.

WANDER
Mody's had coffee with Internal Affairs
twice this week. If he were a half-decent
cop he’d know we had a trail on him.

LUDLOW
He’s coming after one of us?

Clady sits down, including himself in the hushed conversation.

CLADY
Look who’s joining the living.

WANDER
(re: Ludlow)
Mody's getting in his ear.

CLADY
Stick and move Lud.
(swigs a drink)
He hear from Biggs?

LUDLOW
Who’s Biggs?

WANDER
Mody's contact in I.A.

CLADY
Biggs was dark-horse - pun intended - for
the police commissioner nom. That is,
until our friend here--
(Wander)
--was tapped instead.

Ludlow raises an eyebrow. Wander nods, confirming the news.
22.

LUDLOW
‘bout time.

CLADY
(re: Ludlow)
This guy really has been sleepin’.

WANDER
Now, he’s gonna take his pound by eroding
my best people.

Ludlow looks at them - still playing catch up. BUS BOYS
clear the plates around them.

WANDER

(low)
He’s starting with you, Lud. Inside word
is Mody's feeding you to him on a stick.

CLADY
Your Little Saigon shootout won’t help.

Across the room, Mody sits quietly with THREE OTHER UNIFORMS.
He meets eyes with Ludlow, before looking away.

CLADY
But you’ll be fine. We’re digging our
own dirt on the self-righteous son-of-a-
bitch.

WANDER
Clady--
(let’s stay on track)
All we need from you Lud, is just to keep
on smiling. Alright?

Ludlow produces an unnerving fake smile.

WANDER
I’m serious Lud.

LUDLOW
So what’s he doing here?

CLADY
Keeping up appearances. It’s what I’d do.

Ludlow looks around for his waiter. Makes a move to get up.

WANDER
Whoa, whoa, whoa - what are you doing?
You go anywhere near him your head’s ona
spear.
23.

LUDLOW
I’m not gonna touch him.

Where Wander’s aggravated, Clady’s amused.

CLADY
(’How about that?’ )
He’s not gonna touch him.
(then)
That’s your whole life right there Ludlow.
If you ran about two degrees cooler you
could’ve been in on some very big things.

WANDER
Alright, enough.

Clady gets the hint, turning away.
WANDER
We’ve been here before, haven’t we? When
the earth opened up on you? I took care
of you then; I’m taking care of you now.
Now goddamnit just...fall in for once.
Ludlow absorbs it all. Then--

LUDLOW
I was just gonna take a piss.

After a beat, Wander relaxes--
WANDER
You’re an asshole.
INT. RESTAURANT HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ludlow lurks outside the men’s room. We HEAR a clinking sound
from his palm: VODKA MINIATURES rolling over each other.

Before Ludlow, the UNIFORMED COPS - Mody the nearest - are
making a slow exit. Mody sees Ludlow waiting in the wings.

LUDLOW
(mouths )
Black before blue.

Mody reads ‘black’ and sees red. He approaches Ludlow--

MODY
What was that?
24.

LUDLOW
It’s a poem. For you. All the brother
cops I ever knew, you’re the only one who
was always black before blue.

MODY
Now what makes you say that?

Ludlow checks the dining room; Wander’s not watching.

LUDLOW
You feeling left out Mody? You’re
welcome to join us in all our plotting
and scheming.

MODY
Oh, I’m quite sure I’m not.

LUDLOW
What do you think you know around here?
You’re a bystander, Mody. You exclude
yourself and then you say ‘I wasn’t
invited. The bad white men left me out.’

MODY
You a Christian Ludlow?

LUDLOW
(scoffs)
Come again?

MODY
Do you believe in the sanctity of Christ?

LUDLOW
Yeah, save me Mody.

Mody extends his arm, blocking Ludlow’s exit.

MODY
Only you can do that for yourself.

LUDLOW
I guess there are no criminals, right?
(‘I got it!’)
That’s why you never make an arrest.

MODY
No one’s beyond salvation.

Mody's really in his face now.
25.

LUDLOW

Mody have you ever fired your weapon?
No. That’s not ‘cause you’re a
Christian. It’s ‘cause you’re an
affirmative action cop with no interest
in real police work. You leave the war
zones to the rest of us, and that’s fine.
Just don’t take it out on me.

(eases past Mody)
It’s not my fault there are Asians in
Little Saigon. Or black people in
Compton.

MODY
(too loud)
Is it their fault your life is shit?

Wander is now watching from a distance. Shoney and DeMille, on
their way out, marvel gleefully at this public stab.

MODY
‘Cause you sure as hell take it out on
them.
From the depths of his soul, Ludlow drags up a smile for Mody.

Mody watches Ludlow off. Fear flashes amid rage.

INT. HALLWAY, 77TH POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY

Ludlow paces outside the door to dispatch...back and forth
like a caged lion.

Finally, he can’t help himself. He bursts into--

INT. DISPATCH - CONTINUOUS

A row of BLACK and HISPANIC WOMEN, all eating lunch at their
stations. Ludlow approaches a LARGE, PRIMPED BLACK WOMAN --

LUDLOW
Looking fine Jada.

JADA
Pssshhh, you so bad Tom Tom.

LUDLOW
Say what’s the 20 on Gil Mody?

Jada keys her headset with three-inch fingernails.
26.

JADA
85-A. Mody, you have ears on?
What’s your 20?
After a beat, Mody's voice comes crackling back.
MODY
Imperial and Prairie, Jada - but I’m off.
What’s up?
She looks up at Ludlow, who makes a ‘forget about it’ motion.
JADA
Sorry about that 85-A. False alarm.
(then)
Tom Tom what--?

She turns to find Ludlow already off on his way.

EXT. IMPERIAL BOULEVARD - DAY

GRIDLOCKED CARS seem to bend in the heat off the asphalt.
Sunglasses on, Ludlow stays two cars behind a Seville up
ahead... MODY'S CAR.

EXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ludlow waits in his car - intently rolling the VODKA
MINIATURES on his knee.

Across the street, Mody exits the bank, pushing a THICK
ENVELOPE into his jacket as he returns to his car.

Ludlow rolls out after Mody's Seville.

INT. LUDLOW’S CAMARO - A SHORT TIME LATER

Through Ludlow’s windshield, we see Mody turn RIGHT, into a
KOREAN GROCERY STORE.

Ludlow cranks a LEFT, pulling into the parking lot of a
decrepit mini-mall. He kills the engine, watching as Mody
enters the store.

Sweat seeps through Ludlow’s skin as he fixedly watches the
storefront across the street...

Without taking his eyes off the store, Ludlow slowly - almost
ritually - unscrews the lid of a vodka miniature. He puts it
to his lips, and this time...he DRINKS IT DOWN.
27.

Galvanized, Ludlow pulls off his belt. He begins wrapping it
tightly around his right hand...

EXT. JU-JIN MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

Hand tight at his side, Ludlow stalks across the street. He
pauses for a BROWN MONTE CARLO that rumbles past, pulling in
next to the Seville.

Reaching the front door of the store, Ludlow glances back;
it’s just a flash - a frozen moment:

TWO BLACK MALES - afros and expressionless yellow eyes. The

driver makes a seemingly innocuous gesture, ‘scratching’
under his collar...

INT. JU-JIN MARKET - CONTINUOUS

Ludlow drifts to a halt a few steps inside. He stands -
thunderstruck - as something invades his consciousness...

The belt uncoils from his fist, dropping to the floor...
He looks back at the Monte Carlo. The driver wasn’t
scratching anything; he’s fastening a BULLET-PROOF VEST.
The passenger readies a SUB-MACHINE GUN in his lap.

Ludlow crouches, drawing his service revolver. He recedes
into the store, rounding a corner in a swift run-walk.

Down the aisle ahead, Mody shops...
LUDLOW
(hisses)
Mody.

When Mody turns - and sees Ludlow coming at him, service
revolver in hand...

MODY
Ludlow...

He swings his shopping basket, SLAMMING it in Ludlow’s face
like a bag of rocks.

Ludlow - caught completely off-guard - goes smacking back
into the shelves in an avalanche of dry goods.

LUDLOW
Mody...é
28.

But Mody is on him before he can rise, pistol-whipping him
with his gun back to the floor.

LUDLOW
What the fuck are you doing!?

Mody stomps on Ludlow’s gun-hand and jams his .38 service
revolver under Ludlow’s cheekbone.

MODY
Drop it!

LUDLOW
Are you fucking crazy!

MODY
Let it go!

Mody's shaking. He’s going to shoot Ludlow point-blank -
right here, right now - right in the face.

The gun slips from Ludlow’s fingers.

LUDLOW
Listen to me you fucking idiot - two
silverbacks are about to roll in here
hot!

Mody yanks cuffs from his belt and snaps them onto Ludlow’s
wrists.

MODY
And you just happened to be cruising by?

LUDLOW
This isn’t you and me--

But before Ludlow can finish, time GRINDS DOWN. At the end
of the aisle, the TWO MEN FROM THE PARKING LOT...

SUB-MACHINE GUNS in their hands.

In a drawn-out second, Mody realizes that Ludlow was telling
the truth. Then--

BOOM! TIME HOOKS again as one gunman shoots the GROCER point
blank. The other aims down the aisle - at the detectives
caught like feuding children...

Mody STRUGGLES with his holster... Ludlow crawls for cover,
Mody an inadvertent SHIELD... as THUNDEROUS FIRE erupts.

Still handcuffed, Ludlow fumbles with a key. He unlocks one
wrist and immediately RETURNS FIRE down the aisle.
29.

EVERYTHING AROUND HIM EXPLODES in reply. Ludlow tries to
stay small, to weather the storm, when it all falls SILENT...

He waits coiled - heart pounding - for them to step around
the corner and kill him. But the only thing that edges round
to him is a spreading POOL OF BLOOD.

We HEAR the shooters exit hurriedly. Ludlow cranes around
the corner, finding only Mody. He hurries to the fellow
officer’s side...

Mody's face is opened up. He breathes in bubbling gasps.
Ludlow grasps Mody's hand...

LUDLOW
Mody - Jesus - stay with me man. I/’11
get help. I’m gonna get help.
But Mody's hand tightens on Ludlow’s, not letting him go.

MODY
---I thought... it’d be you...

Mody's blood-sputtering breathing climaxes...then STOPS abruptly.

VOICES
Freeze!

Ludlow looks up to find TWO UNIFORMED COPS. His bloody hand
slips out of Mody's; he raises his arms...

LUDLOW
I’m a cop.

One of the wide-eyed cops pushes his partner’s gun down.

YOUNG COP
Yeah... Ludlow.

The other cop kneels to examine what’s left of Mody.

OTHER COP
Ho-lee shit. This one’s PD too.
YOUNG COP
(to Ludlow)

You just get here? You see anything?

Cars skidding up outside. Silently, a million emotions
racing through him, Ludlow gathers the HANDCUFF dangling from
his wrist up into his sleeve.
30.

INT. JU-JIN MARKET - LATER - NIGHT

Wander cuts through a buzzing crime-scene: POLICE OFFICERS,
FORENSICS TECHNICIANS...

Wander carries NONE of his affable nature this time. He
spares a grim, cursory glance at the Korean grocer lying dead
behind the counter.

Near Mody's body, Shoney and DeMille are marking bullets.
Wander lifts a plastic tarp on the ground, taking in the gory
pit that was once Mody's face.

WANDER
Surveillance tape?

DeMille nods toward a back office.

INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow sits sullenly, Clady staring down at him. Wander
enters, closing the door behind him.

A silence.

WANDER
How bad?

Ludlow wordlessly hands him something from his pocket.
A VIDEOTAPE. Wander weighs it a moment, then hands it
to Clady. Wander’s sergeant puts it in the player...

A GRAINY IMAGE of Mody idly shopping.

Ludlow suddenly appears - gun at his side - moving quickly
towards Mody.

Mody cold-cocks him with the basket and tackles him.

WANDER
+--Jesus Ludlow...
The SHOOTERS enter... They OPEN FIRE as Ludlow crawls and
Mody falls.

One of the gunmen scurries up to Mody, firing down on him at
point blank.

Wander exchanges a LOOK with Clady, then ejects the tape.
31.

LUDLOW
It was a straight heist that went bad--

WANDER
Don’t say anything yet.

Wander looks to Clady, less emotional, for his take.

CLADY
Doesn’t matter what it was.

LUDLOW
It’s not what it looks like.

WANDER
That’s all there is, Lud! How it fucking
looks. Now shut up for a second.

CLADY
(re: Ludlow)
Well, he’s not a cop anymore.

Ludlow reels.

CLADY
The wrong prosecutor sees this... Yeah,
time. Big time.

LUDLOW
For what? Because Mody was in the wrong
place at the wrong time--

WANDER

No because you were! Who gives a shit
about Mody?

(then)
Jesus Christ, you can never see two moves
ahead, can you? You pulled two thugs off
the street and went after a cop who was
testifying against you. It writes
itself.

A KNOCK on the door. Clady opens it an inch - whispers
DeMille away.

WANDER
This is a wet dream for Biggs.

LUDLOW
(low)
If I was gonna kill him I wouldn’t need
two thugs.
32.

Wander snaps, lunging at Ludlow and holding him by the hair.
The Lieutenant may be off the street, but he’s very strong.

WANDER
Is this who you are? Huh? You take a
belt to another cop?

Clady gets between them.

CLADY
Alright. Alright. We’re okay.

WANDER
How many times have I gone to bat for
you? Every time! You think this is just
about you?

Wander turns away, embarrassed by his outburst.

LUDLOW
What do you want from me? I fucked up.
You want my badge? You want me to do the
time? I don’t fucking care.

CLADY
(calmly)
Lud, you may not care how the rest of the
world sees you, but you go down you stain
all of us. This whole department...
Speak up if you disagree.

Ludlow stares at the floor like a schoolboy. Wander kneads
his brow, agonized.

WANDER
Anyone else see this tape?

LUDLOW
What difference does it make? Even
without the tape the shooters put me in
the store.

WANDER
Not if they never get picked up.

Ludlow moves from confused...to astonished.

WANDER
(plainly)
I want my new job, Lud. I know Clady’s
not ready to work security... All I asked
was that you stay away from him.

(then)
(MORE)
33.
WANDER (cont'd)
You crossed me on this one, but you don’t
deserve to go to jail for it. Letting
Biggs throw you to the lions isn’t gonna
bring Mody back.

Wander checks with Clady before saying it...

WANDER
This one’ll go to ‘Unsolveds.’ If you
get a pass...they get one too.

CLADY
(nods; heavily)
Unsolveds.

LUDLOW
(sheepishly)
I could take my chances with a jury.

CLADY
(amused)
To the fucking lions.

WANDER

Justice is a live wire Lud. You wanna
let go? Let the system work you? Or you
wanna let us do our jobs?

(candidly)
This is what we do for our own Lud.
You’re just usually home in bed at this
point.

In a dreamlike state, Ludlow finds himself nodding.

WANDER
Alright, we’re moving forward. Let’s get
an acceptable account.

All eyes on Clady; we’re in his world now.

CLADY
Mody was off duty, shopping. Two perps
rolled in on a 211. Ludlow was first on
scene - fellow officer was already down.
Simple. No changes.

WANDER
(to Ludlow)
Got that?
(beyond disappointed)
Bring your uniform tomorrow.

Wander exits as Clady ejects the tape.
34.

CLADY
We would’ve busted Mody without you.

Ludlow’s left alone with the video tape. After a life-
changing beat, he rises...and POCKETS the tape.

INT. JU-JIN MARKET - CONTINUOUS

The morbid crime scene HUSHES as Ludlow emerges. He finds
DeMille, who nods understandingly.

Shoney opens the front door, leading Ludlow out.

EXT. JU-JIN MARKET

Megan steps out of the KCAL news van, searching for the usual
suspects through a host of ONLOOKERS. She locks eyes with
Ludlow, sensing immediately that this crime scene is different.

Ludlow turns away from Megan, finding DeMille waiting
patiently, holding his car door. And Ludlow realizes, things
have changed with Shoney and DeMille...he’s one of them now.

Megan watches as he disappears - complicit - into the car.

INT. LUDLOW’S HOME - NIGHT

Ludlow sits alone, chopsticks and empty takeout cartons before
him. His windows are covered in HEAVY DRAPES, his sun-stained
walls bare, save for WHITE PATCHES where pictures have been
taken down. He watches a familiar face on his TV...

MEGAN
Two male suspects are wanted for the
slaying of an off duty police officer
tonight. The officer has been identified
as Gilbert Mody, a 25 year veteran of the
Los Angeles Police department. A source
close to the investigation tells me
exclusively that Mody was inside the
Korean market behind me, when the
suspects entered to rob it.
(off her notes)
Mody is survived by his wife Linda... and
just from speaking to those on the scene,
I can tell you that this is a loss not
only to her, but to this entire community
where Mody was very well-known and
liked...
(her notes again)
(MORE)
35.

MEGAN (cont'd)
Funeral services are expected to be held
Friday at the Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angels...

Ludlow mutes the television, staring blankly at Megan.

INT. 77TH POLICE STATION - THE NEXT MORNING

TWO DESK SERGEANT’s stare curiously as Ludlow totes his
uniform over his shoulder. They’ve never seen him before.

DEEPER INTO THE STATION

Ludlow walks crookedly - no sleep, and the weight of this new
world on his shoulders. He begins to be recognized by the
‘day shift’...

Ludlow ignores the passing stares, heading into--

INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow dresses at his locker, buttoning a dusty uniform.
It’s been a long time.

A PASSING OFFICER slaps him on the back. It’s meant amicably,
but it’s just a tad too hard.

Ludlow looks back curiously, then returns to his tie - trying
to clip it on.

2ND PASSING OFFICER
(low)
Still the man.

Now Ludlow turns around. He garners the attention of a
FELLOW NIGHTWATCHMAN, who sits exhausted after a long night.

FELLOW NIGHT WATCHMAN
Attaboy Lud.

They assume he has killed Mody - and he’s the toast of the town.
As Ludlow closes his locker, something catches his eye...

Down the line, a locker with MODY’S NAME... A BLACK LINE
CROSSED THROUGH IT. Ludlow’s enjoying none of this.

INT. WANDER’S OFFICE - A SHORT TIME LATER

Wander’s on the phone, signing a gift basket that his SECRETARY
holds in front of him. He motions Ludlow in.
36.

WANDER (ON PHONE)
Well, listen, it’s a reminder isn’t it?
My officers face that threat every day
they put on the uniform. You just don’t
write stories about it.

Ludlow stands sheepishly - not sure if he should sit.

WANDER
Alright. I’11 be reading it.
(hangs up; to Ludlow)
Sit down. Sheila bring Tom some coffee.

Ludlow cups himself - his silent protest - as he sits.

WANDER

How you doing? You sleep?

(wryly)
You’ve been getting me out of bed more and
more these days...

(then; heavily)
We’re all seeing just a little too much
of you Tom, for someone who’s supposed to
work out of sight, out of mind... Nobody
wants you in their living room. Christ,
I don’t even wanna know half the things
you do.

Wander mutes his ringing telephone.

WANDER
Look, I’m not trying to give you another
dose here. But I gotta bury you
somewhere for a while. A nice,
politically correct little spot.

LUDLOW
The fuck does that mean?

Sheila stands stunned beside Ludlow, his coffee in her hands.
WANDER
You’re a doll Sheila. We’1l take that on
the road.

INT. HALLWAY, COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ludlow looks even more uncomfortable, trailing Wander with a
cup and saucer in his hands. They arrive at a

SPARSE, DREARY OFFICE. The sign on the door: CIVILIAN
COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATION.
37.

LUDLOW
Anywhere else. I’m asking you as a
friend.

WANDER
(amused)
Look at it this way: it’s your first day
of school and all the other kids already
know you.

Indeed, a HALF-DOZEN COMPLAINT INVESTIGATORS stare at Ludlow.
He’s well known here. A SUPERVISOR approaches.

LUDLOW
(under his breath)
Fuckin’ embarrassing.

SUPERVISOR
Lieutenant.

WANDER
He’s all yours.
(whispers)
It’s just temporary Lud.

Ludlow hands off his coffee cup, being led away.

WANDER
Play nice now.

MOMENTS LATER,
The supervisor whizzes Ludlow past the gaping ‘desk jockeys’.

SUPERVISOR
--your job is to interview the
complainants and do back-up interviews if
you get two or more complaints against a
given officer. The temptation is to be a
good brother cop. Don’t be. Most of
this shit’s not going anywhere anyway.
Handle that?

They arrive at a small desk.

LUDLOW
Suppose I get a complaint against myself?

SUPERVISOR
(without irony)
Write it up and file it under standard
guidelines.

A SHORT TIME LATER
38.

Ludlow guzzles a coffee, waiting for his first complaint.
His eyes drift to a poster on the wall: a LATIN OFFICER
posing with ADMIRING CHILDREN.

MAN’S VOICE
Wake up, popo.

Ludlow turns to find a YOUNG WHITE PUNK staring at him.
He is the first in a string of COMPLAINANTS - all colors
and creeds - but all lower middle class or impoverished.

Ludlow uncaps his pen...takes a deep breath...

LUDLOW
You have a complaint?

WHITE PUNK
Shoot I got multiple. Okay? Multiple
complaints need addressin’.

BLACK MAN
Motherfucker looked like you. But black.
Beat my ass like Rodney King. But there
wasn’t no video.

ASIAN WOMAN
Pull me over for no reason!

LATIN MAN
Forced me out of my car, holmes.

BLACK WOMAN
Out of my house... Didn’t even care my
children were there.

WHITE PUNK
My boys was right there, and they make me
look like a bitch.

Hold on Ludlow. He reaches into a drawer, grabs a BOX OF
TISSUES and places it before the stunned punk.

BACK TO MONTAGE:
HISPANIC MAN
(holding piece of paper)
I know the law. But you don’t know that
I know!

Ludlow downs an Aspirin, making his ‘keep going’ gesture.
39.

OLDER BLACK MAN
Stop doing that. It’s an impertinent
gesture and I’m not a suspect you’re
grilling for information.

(then)

Now I assure you, if I was dealing drugs
I’d have more than a hundred and twelve
dollars on me. But they took it anyway.
Saying it was ‘company money’ now.

Ludlow stops. Actually looks at the complainant--

LUDLOW
You get a badge number?

OLDER BLACK MAN
Well since his foot was on my throat, I
missed it. But it wasn’t just the one
guy. There was two or three of them,
saying they gonna ‘take it home’.

Ludlow digests a moment, then makes his ‘keep going’ gesture.
HISPANIC MAN
(ve: piece of paper)
Look at it. You can see it right there.

Behind the aggravated complainant, a DISTINGUISHED BLACK MAN
waits his turn.

LUDLOW
There’s nothing wrong with this warrant.

The Hispanic man points to the crumpled page in Ludlow’s hand.

HISPANIC MAN
It says they lookin’ for a gun!

LUDLOW
And did they find a gun?

HISPANIC MAN
Yeah, but it don’t say nothing about no
coke.

LUDLOW
They found some coke?

HISPANIC MAN
Yeah, but it ain’t on there. That
warrant’s for a gun.

Ludlow stares a disbelieving beat.
40.

LUDLOW
Yeah, I see your point.

HISPANIC MAN
Yeah.

Ludlow motions for him to get up--

LUDLOW
Yeah, lawyer up. See what you can do.

The Hispanic man rises, not entirely sure of what’s happening.

HISPANIC MAN
See what-- Yeah. Damn right I will.

The distinguished black man (BIGGS) watches the complainant
off, then sits calmly across from Ludlow. ANOTHER BLACK MAN
waits at a distance, not unlike a bodyguard.

BIGGS
Say, aren’t you that cop I saw on TV?

LUDLOW
Do you have a more specific complaint
against me?

Biggs, a well-kept 50, unbuttons his three piece suit.

BIGGS
Wander’s got a sense of humor, I’1l give
him that. Took me all day to track you
down.

Ludlow’s suddenly alert.
BIGGS
(hand reaching out)
Terrel Biggs.

LUDLOW
Tom Ludlow.

BIGGS
Oh yes sir, I know. And me? D’you know

me?

LUDLOW
Sure, you’re the one Mody was snitching to.

Biggs is visibly stunned.
41.

BIGGS
Now that is a hell of a thing to admit to
knowing. Under the circumstances.

Ludlow’s unmoved. He’s unreadable. Biggs recovers--

BIGGS
Alright, good for you.
(bobbing like a boxer)
You caught me with one there.

LUDLOW

Mody tell you I’m just a racist atheist?
BIGGS

Hey, who isn’t these days?

(then)
You did work Firestone in the 90’s, though.
‘Phonebook Tom’. Ain’t that right?

LUDLOW
Got my best confession with a ‘91
Directory.

Biggs stares, like he’s seeing an animal up close for the
first time.

BIGGS
Picked up a few complaints along the way,
didn’t you?

Ludlow stiffens - wondering if the ‘interview’ has begun.

LUDLOW
Is this it?

BIGGS
This is just a back and forth.

LUDLOW
(joylessly)
Twenty-two complaints.

BIGGS
Twenty-three actually. Including the
other night.

LUDLOW
Well I got a few medals in between if
we're counting.

BIGGS

Can’t have one without the other, can you?
(off Ludlow)
(MORE)
42.
BIGGS (cont'd)

I know how it works, Tom. I know Wander
was on duty for almost all those
complaints when he worked the night
watch. I noticed Clady was overseeing
the other night.

(off Ludlow)
Friends in high places.

Ludlow makes his bored, ‘keep going’ gesture.

BIGGS
Like I said, a back and forth Tom.

LUDLOW
I’m not much of a dancer, so if there’s
something you’d like to ask me...
Biggs stares intently, his edge suddenly breaking--
BIGGS
(jokingly)
I just wanna know what you do those
other nights?
Ludlow cracks an ambiguous smile.

BIGGS
They give you a lunch break?

EXT. VJ'S CHILI STAND - DAY

Ludlow sits across from Biggs in a sparsely populated food
court. Neither seems hungry.

The Internal Affairs man places a tape recorder on the table,
pressing ‘RECORD’.

BIGGS
You were first respondent last night...
Tom?
Ludlow hesitates, eyeing Biggs’ ASSISTANT at a nearby table.
BIGGS
(ve: ‘the interview’)
This is it.
Then... Ludlow does it. He lies--

LUDLOW
Yeah.
43.

BIGGS
‘Yeah’, you’re Tom Ludlow? Or ‘yeah’,
you were first on scene.

LUDLOW
Both.

BIGGS
Were you alcohol-impaired at the time of
the shooting?

LUDLOW
No.

BIGGS
So you could describe the shooters.

LUDLOW
Height, weight - yeah.

BIGGS
Three men?

LUDLOW
Two.

Biggs looks irritated as TWO PLAYING CHILDREN storm past.

BIGGS
You a law and order man, Tom? Would that
describe you?

LUDLOW
Sure.

BIGGS
But more order than law, right? What I
mean is, Tom, at the end of the day it’s
order that counts. Don’t sweat the
details; break a few eggs to make an
omelette; break a few bones to keep the
public safe.

LUDLOW
Whatever you say.

BIGGS
I guess what I’m saying Tom - what I’m
asking - is if you and Wander keep
tearing down the law to go after the
devil...then what protects us when the
devil comes after us?
44,

LUDLOW
Sounds a little above my pay grade.
BIGGS
That must be a real warm blanket for you.

(then)
Would you lose any sleep Tom, if I told
you that not two, but three calibers of
slugs were pulled from Mody's body?

Ludlow gives nothing away.

BIGGS
To me that means there were three shooters.
(then; soothingly)
What were you doing there Tom?

LUDLOW
First respondent.

BIGGS
I spoke to the second respondents - two
nice young boys. They say they were no
more than two, three blocks away when
they got the call. But you beat’em
there... I wonder if our girl Jada in
dispatch could explain that.

Ludlow just stares at the churning recorder.

BIGGS
‘Officer down’, that mean anything to you?
Or does that change because it was Mody?

Biggs grabs the recorder, angrily STOPPING it--

BIGGS
This bothering you Tom? ‘Cause I gotta
tell yah, nobody seems too upset about
the fact that two cop killers are walking
around out there - living, laughing,
fucking...

LUDLOW
(begrudgingly)
Doesn’t change ‘cause it was Mody.

BIGGS
Then why don’t you go find the
motherfuckers that did it!?

LUDLOW
It’s...not my decision.
45.

BIGGS
Whose is it?

Ludlow’s mouth tightens; he walked right into this one.

LUDLOW
Wander assigns the cases.

BIGGS

Well, I’m sure he’s got his best cop on
this one. Detective--

(searching)
--Diskant. Must be a hell of a cop if
I’ve never heard of him. Anyway I’m sure
he’1l find our two cop killers for us.
Then maybe they can tell us who that
third shooter was. Won’t that be just
ace-crackerjack?

LUDLOW
That’d be great.

BIGGS
Fuck you! Where’s the tape from the
store?

LUDLOW

Was there one?

Biggs gathers his recorder; this ‘interview’ is over.

LUDLOW
You haven’t seen the last of me.
(off Biggs)

That’s your line, right? I’m gonna take
your badge and shove it--

BIGGS
You a little fish Ludlow. I’m a’ bait my
hook with you.
INT. COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY

Ludlow stews at his desk...mulling Biggs’ words.

A COMPLAINANT rambles in muted tones. Suddenly Ludlow rises,
simply walking away.
46.

INT. DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY

Still in his uniform, Ludlow hesitates - watching his fellow
detectives around their bullpens. All of them wear BLACK BANDS
around their badges.

Ludlow swallows his pride, wading forward... WHISPERS and
CHUCKLES in his wake. Shoney and DeMille - the slick black
and white tandem - spot him.

DEMILLE
Oh, that is butch, Ludlow.

As Ludlow heads for them, Shoney and DeMille rise for a fight.

SHONEY
You lost, boy?

LUDLOW
(‘keep going’ motion)
What’s the field breakdown on Mody?

The homicide detectives exchange a disbelieving look.

DEMILLE
Told you he’s a piece of work. Go ahead,
tell him.

SHONEY
(‘get this’)
Diskant’s leading two teams on the
suspects, one tip-chaser team, and one
phone team.

LUDLOW
Why Diskant? Why not you fucks?

SHONEY
Because we’d find they ass Ludlow. Then
who’d be fucked?

Ludlow is visibly repulsed by these men. Nearby, an
observing DETECTIVE places a call - his eyes on Ludlow.

LUDLOW
Well where is he?

DEMILLE
(giddily)
He’s at his desk.

Ludlow starts away--
47.

DEMILLE
You got a guardian angel trying to help
you Ludlow.
(pointedly)
I’d let him.

DISKANT’S DESK - MOMENTS LATER

A FLOPPY-HAIRED DETECTIVE, early 30’s, sits amid organized
chaos - PAPERS and PHOTOGRAPHS everywhere.

Ludlow grabs a nearby chair, swinging it over to Diskant and
sitting heavily. Diskant looks back slowly, over his shoulder--

LUDLOW
You’re Paul Diskant.

DISKANT
Yeah.

LUDLOW
Wander gave you the market shooting?

DISKANT
Yeah.

LUDLOW
You know who I am?

DISKANT
Yeah.

LUDLOW

Well you think you might want to speak
to me about it? Yeah?

DISKANT
(nodding)
You’re on my list.

Ludlow turns his attention to Diskant’s desk. Indeed, he has
a LIST - it actually says ‘INTERVIEWS’ - next to a nameplate
and SEVERAL FILES and PHOTOS...MODY’S SHATTERED FACE AMONG THEM.

LUDLOW
You done this before?

DISKANT
In Portland, yeah.

Ludlow almost loses it. ‘Portland’. He kneads his brow.

LUDLOW
How you doing so far?
48.

DISKANT
I’m still trying to get my ducks ina
row. Get a clear picture of things.

LUDLOW
(sarcastically)
But you definitely got a list.
that we have.

I mean,

DISKANT
What are you doing here Ludlow?

Ludlow looks back; the other gawking detectives make no
effort to turn away.
LUDLOW
Well, not to rush your process, but I want
a ballistics report.

Diskant instinctively puts his hand over the report.

DISKANT
What about it?

LUDLOW
Two or three shooters?

A beat.
DISKANT
They pulled a third type of slug out of
Mody's lung this morning.
Diskant stares knowingly. He’s not as thick as Ludlow presumed.

LUDLOW
What about forensics?

DISKANT
Too soon.

LUDLOW
Is that what they told you?

Diskant’s eyes give him away: ‘Yes.’ Ludlow sighs. He’s
going to have to do this himself.

LUDLOW
(leaving)
Don’t get up.
Diskant watches Ludlow off. Then - as if not wanting to miss
out - he follows.
49.

INT. L.A. COUNTY CORONER’S - DAY

A cold basement area - part lab, part storage. The CHIEF
CORONER looks up from a body, staring at Ludlow through

safety glasses.

LUDLOW
(opening his badge)
I work 77th--

CORONER
Tom Ludlow.

LUDLOW
(calculating)
Yeah, you know me?

CORONER
Sure. You were on TV the other night.
(Ludlow relaxes)
I recognized you from when your wife was
brought in.

Ludlow’s color fades. He focuses on the man.

LUDLOW
You did it?

CORONER
(pointing to table)
Here... yeah.

LUDLOW
(mantra-like)
No foul play.

Diskant suddenly enters, ‘booty wraps’ over his own shoes.

CORONER
(shaking his head)
Just an explosion in her head. I get one
in here a week. They’re all different -
- different places in the brain - but all
the same I guess. Lights out.

The coroner looks at Diskant: ‘booty wraps’ over his shoes.

CORONER
You guys can’t be here.

LUDLOW
I’m with Diskant. He’s lead on the
market shooting.
50.

DISKANT
Wander knows we’re here.

Ludlow looks at Diskant - a brief, trust-building second.

CORONER
(old boy’s club)
What do you need Ludlow?

LUDLOW
Is that Mody?

Indeed it is Ludlow’s old ‘friend’ beneath the coroner.

LUDLOW
Do you have three shooters?

A pregnant beat.

CORONER
Nah. One of the suspects switched to a
smaller, finishing side arm. That’s all.
(then)
Gimme another day I’1ll tell you if it was
Fremont or Coates.

DISKANT
Who’s that? The shooters?

CORONER
(skeptically; to Ludlow)
You’re just walking him through the
motions?

LUDLOW
(re: Diskant)
Yeah, he still wants to make it look good.
(makes the ‘jack off’ sign)
Turn over every stone. You got a lock or
what?

CORONER
(nods )
Prints, hair, even a little blood.
LaShawn Fremont and Wade Coates.

LUDLOW
What kind of history do they have?

CORONER
A bad one. Rape, narcotics...murder.

LUDLOW
Lovely. What about robbery?
51.

One too many questions.

CORONER
I gotta speak to Wander.

LUDLOW
Call him. We’1ll wait right here.

The Coroner retreats skeptically to a phone.

DISKANT
We’re not waiting are we?

LUDLOW
No, we’re not.

Ludlow grabs a PRINTOUT off a counter, exiting hurriedly.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow walks ahead of Diskant down the dark, empty hall.

DISKANT
Jesus. I can’t believe they I.D.’d them
already--
LUDLOW
What kind of deal you cut, Disco?
DISKANT
What?
LUDLOW

You trading up?

DISKANT
What are you talking about?

Without warning, Ludlow HITS Diskant in the stomach.

LUDLOW
Cut the Bambi shit! You’re not solving
this case! You know it’s closed--

DISKANT
I don’t--

Ludlow picks Diskant up, lodging his forearm into the younger
man’s windpipe.

LUDLOW
Who came to you!? Who dealt you in?
52.

Diskant’s eyes are coming out of his head.

DISKANT
Don’t you know?

LUDLOW
Tell me.

DISKANT
(gasping)
Clady.
(Ludlow eases off)
Clady.

Diskant gasps for air; he’s really shook up. Ludlow’s flooded
with embarrassment, but still makes his ‘keep going’ gesture--

DISKANT
He said if I stepped up - took the loss
on this one - I’d be included in bigger
things.

Ludlow deflates, exhausted.

DISKANT
I was told I was doing you a favor.

LUDLOW
How does it work? You mail it in - let
two cop killers walk on my account? You
like me that much? Or are you that
fuckin’ bent already?

DISKANT
I don’t know you. I don’t care about you
or Mody; he was a rat piece of shit,
wasn’t he? I care about my job.

LUDLOW
Climbing before you can walk.

DISKANT

Fuck you Ludlow. What about you? What
are you doing here? All the shit you
pulled, you get a sudden attack of
conscience. You’re better than everybody
else?

(off Ludlow)
You’re the worst one.

Ludlow absorbs the blows. After a long, hard beat, he nods--
53.

LUDLOW
(sullenly)
Yeah, I’m the worst. But there’s
different kinds of bad, Disco...

DISKANT
(cynically)
C’mon. You’re really gonna find these
guys? Ruin your whole life over a cop
nobody liked...who hated you worse than

anyone?

LUDLOW
I just take complaints, Disco... You’re
homicide.

EXT. ADAMS CEMETERY - DAY
21 RIFLES FIRE. They’re reloaded and FIRED AGAIN.

A MOMENT OF SILENCE as Ludlow, dressed in a dark Jc Penny
suit, surveys from the back of a STANDING GALLERY...

Across on open grave - a flag-draped casket still above ground -
a VEILED BLACK WOMAN sits amidst other women. Mody's widow.

The rifles FIRE AGAIN.

Wander stands, head bowed before a microphone. Nearer to
Ludlow, Diskant steals a glance at him through the crowd.

DEMILLE (0.S.)
Just can’t let this dog lie, can you?

Ludlow turns to find his favorite couple, Shoney and DeMille.
They whisper over Wander’s commencing eulogy--

DEMILLE
You know as dumb as you are, I’m probably
just dumb enough myself to understand
your motives.

LUDLOW
(dryly)
Explain them to me sometime. There’s a
thread that keeps eluding me.

DEMILLE
You can’t stand being in debt. That’s
why you got no friends. Somebody helps
you out - you might have to look out for
them someday.
(then)
(MORE)
54.
DEMILLE (cont'd)
I don’t think you give a shit about
Fremont and Coates.

LUDLOW
(‘Does everybody know?)
Jesus... What do you know about them?

DeMille smiles wryly at Shoney.

SHONEY
Heroin caballeros. From Belize. Came up
to make a sale and liked it so much they
never left.

DEMILLE
We busted them ourselves a year ago.
Rape-mutilation. Some black cooze on her
way home from stenography class.

LUDLOW
They walked?

SHONEY
Bad bust. One of our own felt we had
violated Mr. Coates and Mr. Fremont’s
civil rights.

LUDLOW
Did you?

DEMILLE
Of course we did.

Ludlow blinks at them - realizing...

LUDLOW
Mody.

SHONEY
We'd hardly got them downtown before he
started mouthing off about proper
procedure.

DEMILLE
Before you could say ‘bullshit race card’
they were sprung.
(disgusted)
Didn’t even make it into the system.

LUDLOW
(disbelieving)
Mody sprung the shooters from the market.
55.

DEMILLE
They probably didn’t even register his
face before they cracked it with a bullet.

SHONEY
Pretty ironic, isn’t it? He’d still be
alive if it weren’t for all his Negro
self-righteousness.

Clady turns around angrily, silencing the threesome.

DEMILLE
(whispers)
Why do you think Wander put Mody on
poster duty? He was doing more to help
crime than prevent it.

Ludlow tunes them out now, his head swirling.

WANDER
(still at microphone)
..-from his time on the streets, to his
time in your schools and homes. He was a
tireless ambassador for the department,
for his church, and for his family...

EXT. GARDEN RECEPTION - DAY

PHOTOGRAPHERS snap photos as Wander poses joylessly with a
CITY COUNCILMAN.

Ludlow watches from a distance, drinking alone...reddish
punch in a plastic cup. He absentmindedly sets the cup down
at a crowded table, drawing STARES as he winds his way
towards Wander. He’s cut off by Clady--

CLADY
Easy, big fella.
LUDLOW
I’m easy.
CLADY
Take it more easy.
LUDLOW
I’m fucking Chine-easy, Clady.
CLADY
Yeah, well...

(looks back at Wander)
-.-Not with the cameras.
56.

LUDLOW
I don’t want a damn picture with him.

CLADY
He doesn’t want a conversation either.

Wander spots Ludlow, turning away coldly.

CLADY
(admiringly)
Fucking Wander man. Look at all this.
Donations are rolling in, public
support’s through the roof. I don’t know
what Mody's widow’s so upset about...
First good thing her husband ever did.

Ludlow scowls at Clady.

CLADY
(the scowl)
Oooh, that’s good. I’1l take a picture
with you. Watch this.

Clady turns to the cameras, shaking his head in his hand.

CLADY

Terrible. So terrible.

(back to Ludlow)
You know, here we are, running around
trying to close the doors on this thing
for you...

(re: Wander)
You should’ve seen his face when he heard
you were running around opening them up.

(then)
You don’t want to lose your last friend
in him. Believe me.

LUDLOW
Does he know these guys are wanted for
more than just Mody?

CLADY
Of course he does. Everybody knows more
than you Ludlow. Just assume that from
now on.

LUDLOW
Well I’m calling it off. This whole
stand-down order--

CLADY
(hissing)
You don’t call off shit!
(MORE)
57.

CLADY (cont'd)
You hear me? When you took your pass
Fremont and Coates got theirs too.

LUDLOW
Well I’m giving my pass back.

CLADY
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. If you wanted
to play Christ-on-the-Cross you should’ve
done it back in that grocery store. The
second you took that tape it wasn’t just
your own ass on the line. It’s every man
in this department now.

Ludlow looks about the room, OTHER COPS glancing his way.
He finds Diskant, having a drink with Shoney and DeMille.

CLADY
Brothers in arms Lud. You meet with Biggs?
(up close)
We’ll assume it. ‘Cause he’s looking for

any chink in the armor right now.
Clady raises his glass as Ludlow retreats away...

CLADY
Don’t be that chink.

EXT. PARKING LOT, ADAMS CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ludlow walks heavily to his car, barely aware of his
surroundings. No two ways about it... he’s torn.

Nearby, a LIMOUSINE idles. Ludlow finds a procession of
MOURNING BLACK WOMEN approaching. Linda Mody, beautifully
poised, at the center.

Wander watches, from a distance, as Ludlow sets himself in
their path. The women part around him curiously, until Linda--

LUDLOW
Mrs. Mody?

Linda considers him through her thin veil.

LUDLOW
I’m Tom Ludlow.

LINDA
I know who you are, Detective.

LUDLOW
(startled)
I was...first on scene.
58.

She stares at him, in a way that makes him guess at first,
then reduces him to nothing.

LUDLOW
I wanted to say--

LINDA
(smiling)
I thought he had more friends. I
should’ve spoken, but I couldn’t find
one...

Linda is absorbed by her waiting friends, then by the limousine.
Ludlow stands gutted... ‘Lord, here comes the flood...’

INT. LUDLOW’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

«---Guilt washes over Ludlow’s sweating features. He sits in
the stale, dark heat, watching the tape from the market. He
rewinds, over and over, as he drinks from a BOTTLE; no
miniatures this time.

ON HIS SMALL TELEVISION: Ludlow cowers behind a corner,
trying to remove his cuffs. Then...he turns and FIRES down
the aisle...right over Mody.
REWIND. He turns and FIRES down the aisle.
LUDLOW
(the sound a gun makes)
Pf£ffhhhooo.

Ludlow lets it run, looking around his room for an escape.
Then, SOMETHING on the tape catches his welling eyes.

LUDLOW
What the...?

He gets to within inches of the screen...mesmerized.
Suddenly he EJECTS the tape...spooked.

He reaches for his phone, holding it an indecisive beat.

EXT. KCAL 9 NEWS STATION - LATER THAT NIGHT

Megan parks her car, spotting Ludlow lurking in the shadows.
She won’t look at him as she approaches the front entrance.
She fumbles for the right key, feeling his eyes on her.

LUDLOW
Thank you.
59.

MEGAN
I don’t wake up this time of night for
non-sex.

Ludlow simply smiles.

LUDLOW
You’re a delicate flower, Megan.
She holds the door before opening it: ‘Do you want my help?’
LUDLOW
I’11l owe you one.

Ludlow follows Megan inside.

MEGAN

Tell me why you can’t watch this at your
own station?

LUDLOW
I’m not well-liked there.

MEGAN
Can’t imagine why not.

She hits the button for the elevator.

MEGAN
You punch somebody out?

LUDLOW
Not really.

MEGAN
Accuse anyone new of sleeping with your
wife?

LUDLOW
No, I exhausted that list.

Megan steps into the elevator, turning back coyly.
MEGAN
So it’s just basically you they don’t
like.
Ludlow stares at her blankly.

LUDLOW
(the elevator)
I’ll get the next one.
60.

INT. EDITING ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER

Megan works at an editing bay in the small room. Ludlow is
perched expectantly before a large monitor.

MEGAN
Okay, where’s the tape?

Ludlow watches her as she moves proficiently about the room.

LUDLOW

I probably do owe you a....
MEGAN

What?
LUDLOW

I could probably take you somewhere to...
(Megan waits)
«+-apologize.

MEGAN
Yeah? Where’d you have in mind? An
abandoned parking lot?

LUDLOW
I don’t mean like that--

MEGAN
It’s fine Lud. We’re on the same page.

He can’t get near her tonight. She points over his shoulder.
On the LARGE MONITOR: the surveillance tape from the market.

Megan sits, slowly astonished by the soundless violence.

MEGAN
God. You can’t just tell me what
happened?

LUDLOW

Okay, right here. See this mirror? Move
in on that or-- make it better.

Megan tries to magnify the image.

MEGAN
I have people for this, you know?

She brings up the MIRROR in a high corner of the store. ONE
OF THE SHOOTERS can be seen in the reflection.
61.

LUDLOW
Good, okay now run it.

At half-speed, the SHOOTER appears to LIFT HIS STOCKING
MASK...SPIT ON Mody...then SHOOT him at point blank.

LUDLOW
(astonished)
He spat on him.

MEGAN
So he...what? What does--
(dawning on her)
He knew Mody.

Ludlow nods, his fear confirmed.

LUDLOW
Maybe. Yeah.

MEGAN
So, it wasn’t a robbery?

LUDLOW
No...no, that would make it a hit.

Ludlow suddenly heads for the VCR, past a dazed Megan.

MEGAN
He was snitching on you.

Ludlow guiltily pockets the tape.

MEGAN
He was snitching all of you to some
commission.

LUDLOW
(nodding)
I forgot who I was with for a second.

MEGAN
What did he have on you?

LUDLOW
Nothing. Excessive force, racist plays.

MEGAN
That’s it?

LUDLOW
I’d know if there was more... I was just
there to punch him in the mouth.
Time out.

62.

MEGAN
And you brought them to kill him.

LUDLOW
Is that who you think I am?
(then)
I don’t know those guys, Megan. Mody
knew them.

MEGAN
Okay, how?

LUDLOW
Mody sprung them from a bust a year ago.
Clady says he was dirty as all hell.

Megan isn’t sure what to believe.

MEGAN
So...

She makes his ‘keep going’ gesture.

LUDLOW
Maybe they were in bed together.

MEGAN
What do you want me to do?

LUDLOW
Nothing. If you can stand it.

MEGAN
What are you gonna do?

Ludlow considers it a heavy beat. Then, as if surprised by
his own conclusion--

LUDLOW
Nothing.

MEGAN
I don’t believe that.

LUDLOW
Well...you’re alone there.

INT. STATION HALLWAY - DAY

Back in uniform, head sunk down, Ludlow manages a busy hall.
63.

He lifts his eyes, spying through a window to the DETECTIVES’
BULLPENS. Diskant is not at his desk.

INT. POLICE EVIDENCE IMPOUND - DAY
Diskant stands defiantly at a tall counter.

DISKANT
Yeah, Gil Mody... I got a bank statement
here I’m trying to cross-reference. Was
he carrying any cash when he came in?

The CURATOR taps a few keys, reading from his screen--

CURATOR
Yeah - looks like...
(eyebrows )
Ten grand.

INT. COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT - DAY

Ludlow sits disconsolately at his desk. Maybe he is going to
let it go. Across from him sit TWO PROSTITUTES.

PROSTITUTE
This ass worked longer than all y’all
cops disrespecting me--

PROSTITUTE #2
And they always do it on a motherfuckin’
Friday. So we don’t see no judge ‘til
Tuesday and they know that ain’t fair...

Ludlow stares at them - his mind elsewhere.

INT. POLICE VEHICLE IMPOUND - DAY

Diskant completes a circle around Mody's SEVILLE. He rifles
through the glove box and console, then pops the trunk...

It’s empty, aside from a jack and a spare. About to close
the trunk, he spots a SMALL TAG attached to a torn string.
INT. COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT - DAY
Ludlow is mid-conversation with a PERSIAN MAN in jacket and tie.
PERSIAN MAN
I said please, tell me what I am being

charged with. But they just laugh.
(MORE)
64.
PERSIAN MAN (cont'd)
They took only - maybe - a hundred
dollars, but that’s a lot of money back
then... Then I see this picture of this
retiring captain.

The man shows Ludlow a NEWSPAPER PHOTO of SILKY (the retiring
officer from the Pacific Dining Car send-off).

PERSIAN MAN
This is the man who says it was company
money now. That they couldn’t trust me
with what I would spend it on--

LUDLOW
Back up. ‘Company money’, say what...

Ludlow puts down a doughnut. Makes his ‘keep going’ gesture.
PERSIAN MAN
Contribution to his corporation.
(then)
I don’t want my money back. But it

stayed with me, you understand? I am
third generation American, officer.

INT. POLICE EVIDENCE IMPOUND - DAY

An IMPOUND TECH across the counter examines Diskant’s TAG.

IMPOUND TECH
Yeah, it’s an evidence tag.

DISKANT
One of ours?

IMPOUND TECH
It’s got our coding prefix.

He types the numbers into his computer, his brow furrowing.

IMPOUND TECH
Weird... Hold on a sec.

He disappears into the stacks. Diskant turns the screen to
read it: ‘HEROIN - 3.255 Kilos.’

IMPOUND TECH (0O.S.)
Funny...

Diskant quickly turns the screen back as the Tech returns.
IMPOUND TECH

The article’s in its place and properly
tagged.
65.

He picks up and re-examines the tag.
IMPOUND TECH
Wonder where the hell this came from?
INT. COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT - DAY

Ludlow looks up from the NEWSPAPER CLIPPING of Silky. He
looks the Persian man squarely in the eye.

LUDLOW
I’m sorry that happened to you.

The man exhales, a weight lifted.

PERSIAN MAN
Thank you.

And that’s enough for him. He leaves Ludlow with his thoughts.
On his way out, the Persian man passes Diskant - waiting
purposefully. Diskant locks eyes with Ludlow, then walks out.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow sticks his head into the hall. Down the way, Diskant
lets Ludlow spot him, then heads into the MEN’S ROOM.

INT. MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow opens the door hesitantly. He finds it empty, save
for an edgy Diskant.

LUDLOW
This is the faggiest thing I’ve ever
seen.

Diskant stands his ground.
DISKANT
Homophobe. Good to know on top of
everything else.

LUDLOW
What are you doing?

DISKANT
You getting it from all sides on this?
66.

LUDLOW
(sighs; reluctantly)
No worse than you, choir boy.

Diskant glimpses himself in the mirror, a reckoning instant.

DISKANT
Alright listen: I’m not saying I’m doing
anything - or if I tell you one thing I’m
gonna tell you anything else again... but
I think I know what they had on Mody.

Ludlow looks back at the door.

LUDLOW
Go take a piss.

Diskant reluctantly obliges, facing a urinal in case someone
enters. Ludlow moves to the sink.

LUDLOW
Why do you say that?

DISKANT
First of all he had ten large on his
person when he died. I checked out his
car at impound; he had almost four kilos
of ‘H’ in his trunk.

Ludlow takes a moment, as if soaking it all in... Then--
LUDLOW
(xe: urinal)
You put your whole body in it like that?

Diskant moves back, irritated.

DISKANT
Look, if I’m keeping you from your new
job--
LUDLOW
Alright, so you found some ‘H’. So what?
DISKANT

So you still have a professional
curiosity in Fremont and Coates?

Ludlow makes his ‘keep going’ gesture.
DISKANT

What do you think they do when they’re
not raping and robbing?
67.

LUDLOW
They deal heroin.

Ludlow nods slightly; he gets the point.

LUDLOW
And now you wanna shake some trees. Meet
our terrible twosome.

Diskant nods begrudgingly. Not how he would’ve put it.

LUDLOW
Listen, Disco. There’s no shame if you
wanna play ball with Clady. Get in on
some of those big things.

DISKANT
No shame if you wanna take your pass.

Ludlow sizes up Diskant. Maybe he could go to war with this
kid.

LUDLOW
It’s your career.

DISKANT
It’s your funeral.

Ludlow can’t help smirking at the volley. He thinks hard...
Last chance to be smart.

LUDLOW
Alright, let’s work.

EXT. COMPTON - LATER THAT DAY

Ludlow’s Camaro rolls - windows down, stereo pumping - into
the hood. Diskant rides shotgun, second-guessing this whole
thing.

They cross under a sign: CENTURY BOULEVARD. Ludlow - out of
uniform now - kills the music.

LUDLOW
So you’re not exactly the inside man here
Disco, but you ever hear other cops talk
about ‘The Company’? Their corporation
or some shit.

DISKANT
What, like investment funds?
68.

LUDLOW
No, like Serpico, shakedown funds.

DISKANT
(disdainfully)
Not interested.

LUDLOW
I’m not fucking offering dummy, I’m
asking if you’ve heard of it.

DISKANT
No, never have. But I wasn’t around for
the good old Rampart days.
(then)
Why?

LUDLOW
Just a complaint I’m following up on.

Diskant peeks at Ludlow; this guy takes his job seriously.

LUDLOW
Anyway quit congratulating yourself. You
would’ve loved the old days. We were
fucking kings... Just a few bad seeds
that ruined it.

As Ludlow brakes at a red light, a DEEP STEREO BASS begins to
rattle behind them. Without looking, Ludlow places his 9MM
under his thigh.

After a beat, Diskant subtly follows suit, placing a larger
-45 under his leg.

Just then a LOUD CREW OF BLOODS pulls up. They’re ready to
tear into Ludlow -- “This white boy is lost” -- until they
see which white boy it is.

Ludlow stares back at the silenced young men, until - one by
one - they reluctantly look straight ahead.

LUDLOW

(the .45)
The fuck is that?
DISKANT
Too much for you?
LUDLOW
(exasperated)

Almost every shooting is within ten feet,
Disco. That’s gonna go right through
somebody.
69.

DISKANT
-..Guess I’m more humane than you.

Ludlow turns back to the spooked Bloods--

LUDLOW
Green light.

The driver reactively hits the gas, then brakes hard as he
sees the light is still red. In the middle of the
intersection - no one else around - the young men bicker with
each other: “Go! Just go Nigga”...

Ludlow turns amicably to Diskant, really amused. Diskant
shares none of Ludlow’s joy.

Spurned, Ludlow mutters something to himself, driving on...

EXT. CORNER - DAY

THREE HISPANIC TEENAGERS lounge against their car, on their
Meager bit of turf. Ludlow slows, half a block away.

LUDLOW
Alright Disco. Your show.

DISKANT
My show what?

LUDLOW
Gotta start somewhere. Go ask’em where
Fremont and Coates are hiding.

The three teens SCATTER as Ludlow pulls up. Diskant jumps
out, chasing one down the street.

Ludlow drives calmly beside Diskant, enjoying the chase.
The Hispanic ‘RUNNER’ cuts through a
BASEBALL DIAMOND,
prompting Ludlow to floor it onto the field. He spins around
the Runner, causing a CLOUD of DUST as Diskant finally makes
the TACKLE. The young detective wrestles the young runner
into handcuffs.
Ludlow, meanwhile, calmly CRANKS THE HEAT on his dash.
DISKANT
(to teen)

Stop fucking moving! The more you move
the more it hurts.
70.

Diskant gets the dealer up on his feet.

DISKANT
You gonna relax, or you gonna act like a
little bitch?

HISPANIC TEEN
Fuck you tira.

DISKANT
Fuck me?

LUDLOW
Jeez Disco. Don’t you think that’s a
little much?
(off Diskant)
Let’s just everybody cool out for a
second alright?

Ludlow takes the young dealer by the arm.

LUDLOW
Listen, I don’t know what his problem is.
You just sit down for a second, lemme
talk to him, okay hermano?

The dealer nods slightly as Ludlow sits him in his Camaro -
buckling him in before he can react to the SHOOTING HEAT.

Ludlow slams the door shut. Diskant watches - stunned but
not surprised - as the young dealer sweats, squirms...begins
to SCREAM.

Ludlow joins Diskant a quiet beat. Then--

LUDLOW
You married Disco?

DISKANT
(distractedly)
F...Fiancée.

LUDLOW
When’s the big day?

DISKANT
Ah, two summers.

LUDLOW
(amused)
Don’t rush into it now.
71.

DISKANT
Nah, she wants a big one, so I’m trying
to save for it...not easy.

As if an oven timer has rung, Ludlow returns to his car,
opening the door--

LUDLOW
Heroin! Who do I talk to after you?

HISPANIC TEEN

(gasping)
The Grill, holmes. Talk to Grill. He
post at MLK and Fig.

Ludlow turns to Diskant, slapping a hand to his cheek in mock
surprise.
EXT. MARTIN LUTHER KING AND FIGUEROA - A SHORT TIME LATER

GRILL, a young black male, kicks it with a BUDDY and a six-
pack on his tricked-out ‘64 Impala.

GRILL
Aw, hell no.

Ludlow approaches with Diskant in tow.
GRILL
Shouldn’t you be sleeping in a coffin or
some shit?

LUDLOW
You’re easy to spot in the day, Grill.

Grill exchanges a look with his buddy, even with Diskant.

GRILL
Nigga what?

LUDLOW
Great catching up. Listen, you have
something; we need it; you’re gonna give
it to us.

Grill slides off his cherished Impala.
GRILL
Or what Ludlow? You gonna roust me?

Pelican Bay? Lompoc?

He holds his wrists out for handcuffing.
72.

GRILL
Party for me, White. Southside Crips -
that’s my homies up in there.

HIS BUDDY
Hey yo - I go with him?

They laugh together.

GRILL
See that?

He traces a long scar running down his face.

GRILL
Check the grill.

He pulls down his lower lip: no teeth.

GRILL
You know I seen John Wayne badass piggas
like you before. And I tell those
motherfuckers the same thing I tell you.
(leans forward)
Sum motherfucking total of nothing.
(easy)
Your move, White.

BAM! Diskant kicks in the Impala’s shiny door.

GRILL
Nigga what the fuck! I just got that
motha fucka motha fucking painted!

Diskant looks to Ludlow, then KICKS it again.

GRILL
Aw hell no!

Ludlow blocks Grill, as Diskant raises his arms tauntingly -
crazily - beyond.

GRILL
You ain’t gotta be kicking my shit like
that!
(to Ludlow)
What you want!? Maybe I got it!

Ludlow’s almost annoyed that it’s Diskant who has cracked them.

LUDLOW
Don’t tell me, tell Mr. Wayne.
73.

DISKANT
Fremont and Coates.

GRILL
Fremont and Coat--
(searching)
Okay, yeah, yeah I know them cats--

LUDLOW
He’s not gonna touch your car again.

GRILL
(honestly)
Never fucking heard of them.

LUDLOW
But you have heard of heroin, right? I
mean, you do sell it in the L.A. Unified
School District, don’t you?

Ludlow puts a KEY in the Impala’s trunk... Grill looks down
at his chain, realizing Ludlow has ‘picked’ him.

GRILL
Look, yo, heroin’s run out of Lompoc.
How I s’posed to help you if I ain’t in
Lompoc?

Grill immediately regrets saying it. Ludlow’s eyes light up.
LUDLOW
(cheshire grin)
Party for you, right? All your homies in
there.

GRILL
No, no I didn’t say that.

INT. LOMPOC PRISON - NIGHT

Ludlow walks Grill a half-step ahead of him, through the BOWELS
of the prison. Diskant follows down the dark hall, into--

A HOLDING AREA.

INMATES on both sides, as a DEPUTY WARDEN leads our threesome
on. HISSES and GRUMBLINGS from both sides as the Deputy
Warden raps on a metal door.

GIANT’S VOICE
Yo Ludlow! That you? That you boy?
74.

The stalled threesome - Ludlow, Diskant, Grill - turn to find
a 6’6’, 280 pound SKINHEAD straining against his bars.

SKINHEAD
What, you can’t say hello? You don’t know
me now? Look at me you fuck! Turn your
back on me?! I will fucking end you!!

DEPUTY WARDEN
Shut your hole! Shut it!!

Grill, more than a little irked, looks up at Ludlow.
LUDLOW
(straight ahead)
I got homies in here too.

The METAL DOOR clanks open to--

A VAST ROWS of CELLS - stories of them - and a WAITING GUARD.
Our men step through...

LUDLOW
How you doing?
GUARD
Good, how you doing?
LUDLOW
(ve: Grill)

Our boy here’s gonna set up shop tonight.
Take a few visitors, ask a few questions
for me.

The guard nods knowingly. Diskant watches as Ludlow palms a
FEW BILLS, passing them to the guard...just the way it is.

LUDLOW
Alright Grill, you scan your homie
database. Somebody knows Fremont and
Coates, we’ll help that somebody out.
Maybe a knock a year off, depending.
Got it?

GRILL
Yeah. Cool.

Diskant and Ludlow watch Grill off... Then, out of the blue--

LUDLOW
Wanna get some dinner?

DISKANT
Ah, I should be getting back--
75.

LUDLOW
I’m messing with you Disco. Get home to
that pretty wife.

On Diskant - knowing it was a genuine invitation.

INT. USC LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT

A sea of long desks, LAW STUDENTS beneath reading lamps.
AMIDST the younger crowd, LINDA Mody sits before a half-dozen
open books.

LIBRARIAN (0.S.)
No food or drink, sir.

Linda looks up, spotting Ludlow at the far end of the long
hall. He’s eating his dinner - a crummy sandwich - and
staring up at the cavernous ceiling.

Linda looks panicked as Ludlow discards the sandwich. He
wades forward, sifting through the FACES. Something about an
aging law enforcer among youthful law students.

Finally, he SPOTS Linda, approaching cautiously. He grabs
a nearby chair; it SCREECHES across the floor. Ludlow waits
until the surrounding stares fade. Then, over a fragile peace...

LUDLOW
(continuing where he left
off)
I wanted to say that...I’m sorry this
happened to you.

LINDA
How did you know I was here?

LUDLOW
Your next-door neighbor.

Linda looks about the crowded room, beyond uncomfortable.

LUDLOW
So this is where lawyers come from.

LINDA
So now you’ve said it.

Ludlow gives up on levity.
LUDLOW

I didn’t speak either... At my wife’s
funeral--
76.

LINDA
I know where you meant.
(a beat)
He spoke of you often.

LUDLOW
All good I hope.

LINDA
Was there something else?

LUDLOW
.~+-Yeah, I guess there is. I wanted to
tell you that, even if nobody else will...
I’m going to find the men that killed your
husband.

A nearby student’s head snaps up. Linda bolts for the exit.
Ludlow’s look says it all: ‘that may have been a little abrupt.’

EXT. USC CAMPUS LAWNS - NIGHT

Ludlow emerges glumly into a dim courtyard. Linda surprises
him, standing off to the side.

LINDA
What are you apologizing for?

LUDLOW
I’m not apologizing. I’m condoling.

Ludlow thinks of moving to her. Thinks again.

LINDA
Why?

LUDLOW
Because...I was the first one there.

LINDA
So what did you see?

LUDLOW
That’s not gonna make you feel any better--

LINDA
Don’t you be familiar with me. I’m not
joining your club because I lost Gilbert.
(then)
I was on the Sheriff’s for nine years -
I can handle the details.
77.

The CAMPUS NIGHT WATCHMAN - maybe 19 years old - shines his
flashlight on the quarreling pair.

CAMPUS NIGHT WATCHMAN
Everything alright here?

Ludlow looks ready to snap the youngster in two.

LINDA
We’re fine.

Left alone again, Linda’s placid exterior cracks.

LINDA
I’m sorry for your loss. I am. But God
took your wife... Who made Gilbert’s plan?
(bitterly)
Or was it just bad luck?

Linda can’t sense the storm she’s brewing in Ludlow.

LINDA
Loss is loss detective. Not knowing is a
whole different thing.

Ludlow moves close. He’s not going to harm her, but she’s
going to listen.

LUDLOW

My wife had a...thing. She was born with
it in her brain, and she was with someone
when it finally burst. He put her on the
curb at Cedar Sinai, and he drove away.

(nods firmly)
It’s in the not knowing... And I don’t
care who’s plan it was.

Linda holds his stare.

LINDA
So what did you see?

She asked for it.

LUDLOW
It wasn’t an accident. They knew him
somehow and they shot him in the face.
They’re heroin dealers and I think they
were in business with your husband. He
was found with 10,000 in cash when he
died.

(then)

Anyway, I can try to keep all of this
from coming out.
78.

LINDA
(sarcastically)
All for us? Gilbert must’ve really had
you wrong.

Ludlow just stares, tight-lipped. To hell with this.

LINDA
How many people knew he was talking to
Internal Affairs?

LUDLOW
It wasn’t a well-kept secret.

Linda lets her insinuation - indeed accusation - sink in.

LINDA

In my experience, detective, there are
those who find the truth and those who
lead it where they want it to go.

(off Ludlow)
I hope Gilbert was wrong about you...but
your eyes just don’t look clear enough to
me.

LUDLOW
They’re clear.

LINDA

Gilbert was a third-rate street cop. I
can admit that and it doesn’t mean I love
him any less. But he wasn’t dirty. I
asked him to be better and it made hima
pariah. That’s what I would’ve said if I
had spoken.

(heated)
He wasn’t stupid either. He knew his
career would be over after testifying
against all of you. We were going to
leave Friday to live in the Bahamas...
Silly of us, wasn’t it?

LUDLOW
You’re saying that’s what the money was
for?
Linda backs away.
LINDA

I’m saying that funeral wasn’t for him
and you’re not here for us now. I think
you’re here to find out how much I know.
And you know what? He was so afraid of
you he didn’t tell me a thing.
79.

Ludlow watches her off, chewing on that.

LUDLOW
(low)
Night.

INT. BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY

Back in his blues, Ludlow pulls a FILE from a tall, dusty
stack. He looks up suddenly when he hears a NOISE--

MAN’S VOICE
Somebody down here?

Ludlow thinks a moment.

LUDLOW
I am.

MAN’S VOICE
Well who the hell’s that?

LUDLOW
Ludlow.

An ELDERLY OFFICER appears at the end of the row.

OFFICER
Oh, well...hey. What are you...?

LUDLOW
I’m looking for Silky’s old reports.
We’re throwing him a private retirement
party and I’m putting together a gag reel
for him.

The officer laughs and shakes his head like “Ain’t that a
pisser?”

OFFICER
Well he’s too old for the computerized
stuff. You gotta look at the carbon
files.

INT. CIVILIAN COMPLAINTS - DAY

Clady ambles down the hall, peeking furtively in on Ludlow:
right where he should be, at his desk.

Ludlow looks up, receiving a big ‘THUMBS UP’ from Clady; the
stout sergeant is still really enjoying himself.
80.

Ludlow returns to a FILE beneath him. A log entry reads:

BAR VIOLATIONS/1993. Officers Clady, Harnish, Collinson, Mody.

Ludlow stops on Mody - his name right there with Clady’s.

INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE WANDER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow walks purposefully for Wander’s office, FILE in hand.

Ludlow
Wander

Taking
away.

Ludlow

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
No, we got a toe hold, Disco. But a toe
hold’s better than no hold. Just wait
for me there.

stops himself at the last moment from barging in on

and Biggs. The I.A. man stands over Wander’s desk.
an earful, Wander SEES Ludlow but doesn’t give him

Ludlow slinks off gratefully.

CLADY
Help you Lud?

turns to find Clady on his heels.

LUDLOW
Naw, you help me enough Clady.

CLADY

(re: Wander)
He’s taking a beating for you in there.
Standing by your bullshit, ‘first
respondent’ story.

(close to Ludlow)
See they both know it was your bullet Lud.
The third round in Mody. I’d say that
puts you there for a jury, wouldn’t you?

LUDLOW
No. No, the M.E. said one of them--

CLADY
C’mon Lud. You got the tape. You know
they didn’t pull a third gun.
(then)
I told you, we’re trying to help you.

Ludlow swallows, his color fading.

CLADY
Now I’m not saying you killed him, but you
didn’t help him Lud.

(MORE)
sl.

CLADY (cont'd)
And they’1l get you for it. They’1ll get
you on the drinking. They’ll take it all
from you... Let this thing go. For your
own good.

EXT. PARKING LOT, 77TH POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow walks slowly to his car, unbuttoning his uniform.
Shoney and DeMille are just arriving for the night shift--

DEMILLE
Yo Ludlow! How’s complaints?

LUDLOW
Your wife stopped by today.

Shoney laughs. DeMille does not. Ludlow gets into his car -
starts it. Then, after a beat - stops it.

He stares through his dusty windshield...torn apart.

EXT. TACO STAND, EAST L.A. - DUSK

It’s dinner at sunset for Diskant. He stands alone at a high
table, looking about the Barrio for any sign of his partner.

LUDLOW (0.S.)
Hey golden boy.

Ludlow bites into a burrito, perfectly at home in this
Mexican enclave. Diskant looks relieved to see him.

DISKANT

Where you been?
LUDLOW

No rush. I’m here.

Diskant sizes up Ludlow... good enough.

DISKANT

So what are we waiting on?
LUDLOW

(mid-chew)

Address.

DISKANT

Fremont and Coates?

LUDLOW
An associate, apparently.
82.

DISKANT
And you left Grill in there?

LUDLOW
(mock disgust)
I’m not gonna let him walk until it
checks out, Paul.

Diskant looks about, a little uneasy.

DISKANT
Quit with the golden boy shit.

LUDLOW
Well you are, aren’t you? You’re Clady’s
protégé.

DISKANT

You worried about Clady?

LUDLOW
No, I think I’m worried about you, choir
boy. How do I know you’re not reporting
up the ladder on us?

DISKANT
(sighs)
I got more to lose than I can stand here,
Tom. But you go ahead and sucker me
again, ‘cause I don’t think ‘trust me’ is
gonna do it for you.

It’s not much, but it’s Ludlow’s kind of speak.

LUDLOW
(satisfied)
Ask me how’s complaints?

DISKANT
How’s complaints?

Ludlow readies his ‘Your wife stopped by’... Then let’s it go--

LUDLOW
So I’m checking a complaint on Silky;
poor guy retires so they put his picture
in the paper. Now he’s got everybody
coming out of the woodwork on him.
(then)
Ask me who came up together under him.

Diskant makes Ludlow’s ‘keep going’ gesture.
83.

LUDLOW
Clady and Mody. They’re written up
together three times.

DISKANT
So...what? So Clady might have been
involved in Mody's...

LUDLOW
Not what it could mean, Disco. What does
it mean right now.

DISKANT
Means Mody wasn’t always on the outside.

Ludlow nods proudly.
LUDLOW

He was testifying about something. Maybe
he actually had something.

DISKANT
Okay, what?

LUDLOW
Mody's widow said he was going after ‘all
of us.’ Whatever that means.

DISKANT

You spoke to his widow?

LUDLOW
(stream of consciousness)
Something big. Organized. Unionized.

DISKANT
Like a corporation?

DOTS. ..CONNECTING.

LUDLOW
Were you at Silky’s retirement?
(Diskant nods)
So you saw that check Clady pulled out.
Where’s that come from? I didn’t chip
in. Did you? I know it’s not coming out
of Clady’s pocket.

Diskant caves in, absorbing the implications.

DISKANT
I was having more fun a second ago.
84.

LUDLOW
Relax, those are just ‘could be’s’.

Ludlow reads his BEEPING PAGER, already on the move.

LUDLOW
Yo, ho, ho. Toe holds, Disco.

DISKANT
Address?

LUDLOW
(’could be worse’)
Plate.

INT. LUDLOW’S CAMARO - A SHORT TIME LATER
Ludlow guns it through a hole in traffic. Diskant’s shotgun.

LUDLOW (INTO RADIO)
Alright, I’m southbound, just crossed
Imperial. Where’re you?

COP’S VOICE (FROM RADIO)
Well, you should see me. I’m three cars
back of a maroon Cadillac. Owner: Cedric
‘Scribble’ Rose.

LUDLOW
(to Diskant)
That’s our guy.
(into radio; jokingly)
He hasn’t sold any heroin since you’ve
been on him...?

COP’S VOICE
Not as far as I can tell.

LUDLOW (INTO RADIO)
Alright, I see you. Peel off - nice work.

The black and white turns away, leaving the maroon Cadillac
exposed. Diskant readies a POWERFUL RED SPOTLIGHT.

LUDLOW
What are you doing?

DISKANT
I’m gonna pull him over.

LUDLOW
For what?
85.

DISKANT
Are you serious?

LUDLOW
Just wait. Let him roll through this
stop sign.

Both men watch as the driver - amazingly - makes a complete stop.

LUDLOW
Okaaay... Did he signal?
DISKANT
(‘as a matter of fact’)
Yeah.
LUDLOW
Alright, take it easy. What’s on his
rearview?
(excitedly)

Are those dice?
Ludlow’s saved by a voice from his radio--
WOMAN ’S VOICE
Attention 41 A. California license
Robert, Tom, Victor, 101, comes back with
a failure to appear out of Glendale.

LUDLOW
Eeww, that’1l do.

Diskant FIRES the spotlight.

EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

The driver, unseen for now, watches Diskant and Ludlow in his
side mirror. Both detectives approach with weapons drawn.

DISKANT
Hands on the fucking wheel!

Diskant comes face to face with a MASSIVE, SNIFFLING, 40 YEAR-
OLD BLACK MAN... This is SCRIBBLE. Diskant signals over the
car to Ludlow: ‘Check his eyes’.

 

Ludlow drops startlingly into the passenger seat--

LUDLOW
What’up Scribble!?

Scribble stares at Ludlow through shrunken pupils.
86.

SCRIBBLE
What you want with me?

LUDLOW
With you? Nothin’ man. You’re just a
middle rung on a shitty ladder we’re
climbing. But you missed a court date
Scribble. That means we’re all gonna
spend the weekend together... What else
that mean, Disco?

DISKANT
Means he’s gonna pop his trunk.

Scribble begins to tear up like a baby.

SCRIBBLE
What ladder?

LUDLOW
Fremont and Coates. And we had to pay
out for you Scribble, so don’t be cheap
with us.

Scribble weighs two terrible options.
SCRIBBLE
---I ain’t seen them in a week. Nobody
heard from them.

LUDLOW
How long you work with them?

SCRIBBLE
About three months. They dumped my
supplier, took over his client list.

LUDLOW
You don’t have a number?

SCRIBBLE
Naw, man. Motherfuckers call me.

Ludlow takes a moment, cleans his teeth with his tongue.
LUDLOW
You sniff your own glue, Scribble? Huh?

You using?

Scribble turns away.
87.

LUDLOW
You know what today is? Today’s fried-day.
That means you’re not gonna see a judge
‘til Monday - Tuesday. You’re gonna get
sick without your dope, Scribble. You
don’t wanna get sick, do you?

SCRIBBLE
I help you, they kill my ass.

DISKANT
Nobody’s killing your ass Scribble.
We’re not even gonna bust them..

Scribble looks up at Diskant through the driver side window.

LUDLOW
We just want a piece of the action teddy
bear.

SCRIBBLE

(deep breaths)
I picked up from them once...out in
Palmdale. Little cinderblock place.

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD, PALMDALE - DUSK

An undeveloped stretch, apart from a solitary CINDERBLOCK
HOME. A long stretch of desert extends behind it.

9MM drawn, Ludlow cases the front of the house. Diskant
appears from around the back: ‘No sign of anyone.’

Ludlow throws a rock at the door. No response from inside.
He throws another rock through a window. No response. He
kicks a loose section of the window glass, entering the

DRUG SHACK.

The place is RANSACKED - the fridge open, cushions sliced
open...even a section of wall torn open.

Diskant surveys the wall - good place for a stash - as Ludlow
is drawn out the back door...

A BLOODY DRAG MARK - feebly scrubbed - on the concrete patio.
It ends where the sand begins. Ludlow puts his nose in the
air... a SICKENING WAFT leads him to--

THICK OLEANDER BUSHES behind the shack. BUGS SWARM above a
clump of shrubs. Beneath the swarm, Ludlow finds a horde of
RED ANTS around a hole in the sand...
88.

Ludlow kicks at the ants, scattering them and revealing--
TWO DECAYED HEADS, bound in duct tape like mummies.
LUDLOW
Disco!
(then)
Get a shovel!
A SHORT TIME LATER - NIGHT

Diskant coughs as he works a SHOVEL into the ground. He
steps aside as Ludlow pulls out the SECOND PUTRID BODY.

They run their flashlights up and down the corpses. Whoever
they were, they’ve been dead at least several months.

DISKANT
Fremont and Coates’ competition?

Ludlow shrugs, his hands are covered in HUMAN MUSH.

LUDLOW
That might be asking a little much from
Scribble.

DISKANT

So what now?

LUDLOW
I got a deputy coroner owes me a favor.
Let’s get’em I.D.’d.

DISKANT
You know a certified M.E. who’ll bag and
freeze two decomps?

LUDLOW
From the good old days.

DISKANT
Must owe you a hell of a favor.

LUDLOW
(smiling)
I caught him going down on a foxy little
cadaver.

Diskant starts to laugh, but the smell sends him dry-heaving.
89.

EXT. STREET (IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE) - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow raps on the hood of his Camaro. All 300 handcuffed
pounds of Scribble shift in Ludlow’s tiny backseat.

LUDLOW
Nobody here Scribble!

Scribble’s head comes up slowly from his hiding place.

SCRIBBLE
I told yo ass they wouldn’t be.

LUDLOW
Cut the jive and listen. Fremont and
Coates call you again - you set up a meet
for us. Face to face.

SCRIBBLE
You crazy White? You might’s well have
Vice tattooed on your forehead.

LUDLOW
(smiles)
You just tell them I can do for them what
Mody can’t anymore. You got that? Mody.
They’11 know what you mean.

Scribble nods reluctantly.

SCRIBBLE
Can’t we all just go home, now?

INT. WANDER’S HOME - NIGHT
Wander descends moonlit stairs. KNOCKING at his front door.
He fastens his robe - dragged out of bed apparently - as
ANOTHER LOUD KNOCK annoys him. He opens the door to find--
WANDER

Jesus, Lud. I don’t work the night

anymore.
Ludlow just stands there.

LUDLOW
Oh yeah.

Wander leaves the door open, heading for the kitchen.
INT. WANDER’S KITCHEN - DEAD OF NIGHT

90.

Wander makes coffee atop a fine granite counter. Ludlow sits

at an oak kitchen table.

WANDER
How’s that reporter of yours.
(off Ludlow)
Alright, how’s complaints?

LUDLOW
(half a smile)
Haven’t been there much lately.

WANDER
No, no you haven’t.
(then)
You can’t let it go, can you?
LUDLOW
(whispers)

These are bad guys, Terry. They’re
wiping out their competition. We found a
drug shack they took over in Palmdale.
The previous tenants are buried in the
backyard... I think I can get a face to
face.

Wander considers the world Ludlow has brought into his home.

WANDER
You don’t need to whisper, Lud.
(looks upstairs)
Katrina’s been gone for a year.

LUDLOW
(‘Jesus’)

Okay. Am I the only one who missed that--

WANDER
She still comes with me to certain
events. There’s a political side to my
job that never interested you.
(then)
We had a lot of late nights around this
table, didn’t we? The four of us?

Ludlow nods.
WANDER

I should’ve known you’d be you on this
thing. Should’ve let you take the fall.
91.

Ludlow wrings his face in his hands.

LUDLOW
I left my badge in the car when I went
after Mody. I can’t hide behind it now.

WANDER

(sighs)
Well I give up. You wanna lead Diskant
around by the collar - teach him all your
old tricks - go ahead. Go on huntin’.
But whatever you two catch...don’t bring
it home to the station. You do it the
old way. Settle it out there.

Ludlow just blinks.
WANDER
I’1l back you again.
INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - DAY

GOLD TEETH next to GREY ONES. Outside the cadaver’s mouth,
a SEEDY CORONER works with a clamp.

OUTSIDE THE EXAM ROOM, Ludlow stares glassily through a
window.

Diskant works nearby - he’s got a TIMELINE going: the Ju Jin
Market...Fremont and Coates...Bodies in Palmdale...

DISKANT
Wait - so Mody's wife admitted Mody was
dirty?

LUDLOW

She said if he ever was, he cleaned it up.

DISKANT
You think he was working with Fremont and
Coates or not?

Ludlow doesn’t move.

LUDLOW

I’m inclined to believe...I don’t know.
But everything comes down to that.
Either he was, and it was a simple score
being settled.

(a heavy beat)
Or Mody was clean, and we’re up to our
necks in I-don’t-even-know-what.
92.

DISKANT
(pleadingly)
We found the dope in his trunk.

LUDLOW
(scornfully)
What did you find? You found an evidence
tag on a torn piece of string.
(then)
Nobody seems to know Mody. Not Scribble,
or Grill...

Diskant knows where Ludlow’s heading.

DISKANT
Is there any chance Mody was just wrong-
place-wrong-time?

LUDLOW
You’re looking at Fremont and Coates’ rap
sheet. You see them pulling any Mickey
Mouse mini-mart holdups?

DISKANT
(sighs)
They weren’t there for the register.

LUDLOW
Okay, Junior G. So if Mody was clean, and
this wasn’t a personal score being settled...

DISKANT
Somebody hired them.

LUDLOW
(miserably)
On a different score.

The exhausted coroner emerges.

CORONER
LaShawn Fremont and Wade Coates.

LUDLOW
(‘And?’)
Yeah...

CORONER
Yeah, Fremont and Coates.

LUDLOW
What do you mean?
(the exam room)
In there?
93.

CORONER
On my tables.

DISKANT
Fremont and Coates?

CORONER
(sarcastically)
Who’s on first? Yeah, Fremont and Coates.
What the hell’s wrong with you two?

Diskant’s CELL PHONE rings. When he sees the number he exits
reluctantly.

LUDLOW
Dead how long?

CORONER
I’d say four to six months. Took two
nines to the back of the head. No hands
on either of them so I had to go dental.

He hands Ludlow the bullets.

LUDLOW
Did you say no hands?

CORONER
We’re quits now Ludlow. No more favors.

The coroner retreats to his office. Ludlow just sits there...
head spinning. Diskant returns, the blood drained from his
face. He holds up his cell phone--

DISKANT
It’s Scribble.

LUDLOW
Oh yeah?

DISKANT

He’s with Fremont and Coates.
Ludlow swallows. That's interesting. He motions for the phone.

LUDLOW (INTO PHONE)
I knew you were the man, Scribble.
(listens)
Of course we got the shit.
(listens)
Tonight’s real good. Where?

Ludlow motions for a pen, then - deflated - waves it off.
94.

LUDLOW
(deliberating)
No, no that’s fine. You call this number
with the place... And Scribble? You be
there too.

Ludlow hangs up. An EERIE SILENCE between the detectives.

LUDLOW
Don’t say anything for a second.

Ludlow keeps thinking... He SEES Diskant’s ready to explode.

LUDLOW
(‘keep going gesture’)
Alright, go ahead.

DISKANT
(quickly)
Who the fuck are we meeting tonight if
Fremont and Coates are in there? And -
gee, I don’t know - who killed Mody?
‘Cause I’m pretty sure these two were
dead three days ago.

Ludlow stares off, thinking.

DISKANT
Oh man, this is fucked. I thought you
knew what you were doing.
(then)
Okay, well somebody’s lying.

LUDLOW
No fucking shit Disco.

DISKANT
(xe: the coroner)
Maybe this old perv got it wrong.

LUDLOW
What, he just pulled those names out of
a hat?

Diskant shakes his head, finally calming.

DISKANT
You saying it’s cops that made a mistake?
The hair, the prints - maybe they locked
in the wrong guys.

LUDLOW
I think we’re beyond accidents at this
point, Disco.
95.

DISKANT
Meaning what?

LUDLOW
Meaning there’s a loop that you and I
missed out on. I think we’re hitting on
some of those big things you were promised.

DISKANT
So one of ours pulled Mody’s killers off
the street?

LUDLOW
That’s a could be.

DISKANT
Okay, right now it means...the guys posing
as Fremont and Coates, were posing as
Fremont and Coates when they killed Mody.

LUDLOW
For who? For why?

Diskant caves in again.
DISKANT
Is there any way to find out without
actually meeting them?

Ludlow just smiles.

LUDLOW
We need more dope.

DISKANT
(no big deal)
We’ll sign it out.
LUDLOW
I hate to remind you Disco, but we’re on
our own with this thing.

DISKANT
So we’ll boost it.

Ludlow’s head rolls back...he’s created a monster.

LUDLOW
Your show.

Diskant nods, convincing himself.
96.

DISKANT
Is there time for me to roll home? Grab
some of my gear?

LUDLOW
Yeah, go kiss her goodbye.

Diskant chortles. Then, somewhat dolefully--

DISKANT
Guess we should get our affairs in order.

Ludlow nods; the kid’s growing on him. Ludlow’s cell phone
RINGS. The display reads: ‘Megan’... He simply stares at it.
EXT. MIDDLE CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK

Ludlow stands at the door of a small home. It appears he’s
been there for some time. In his hand, the VIDEOTAPE.

LINDA MODY opens her front door. She contemplates Ludlow and
his tape, before opening the door further.

LUDLOW
I don’t want to intrude.

LINDA
(a hint of good nature)
Well I don’t want you seen on my porch.
STREET POV: from inside a parked car, we WATCH Ludlow enter
the house... REVEAL Shoney and DeMille, tailing Ludlow.
INT. MODY HOME - CONTINUOUS
The floor is a surreal mix of FLOWERS and MOVING BOXES.
Everything is covered in sheets - the television, furniture -

except for a few standing pictures of Gilbert Mody.

Ludlow still carries the videotape - his personal albatross.

LINDA
Should I know what that is?
LUDLOW
You said you wanted to know.
(searching)

---I stole it from the market that day.
I was there...before he died.

LINDA
Why?
97.

LUDLOW
I heard he was testifying...against me.
I was gonna hurt him.

LINDA
Did you?

LUDLOW
I would have...

Linda’s rooted to the ground. Her stoicism breaks Ludlow down--
LUDLOW
I thought he was trying to take what I
had left.
She regards the tape.

LINDA
And now I can take it.

Ludlow nods, his penance complete. He starts for the door.
LINDA
I think I said something unforgivable to
you. About your wife.

Ludlow turns back calmly.

LUDLOW
You know I think I was just happy to talk
about her.

LINDA

I’m sure she was lovely.

LUDLOW
Well we weren’t that great, obviously.
But I didn’t think we were that bad
either.

Linda looks at him, truly, for the first time.

LINDA
Make room for someone else, detective.
While you’re waiting for it all to make
sense.
(all the flowers)
I’m in the club, so I can say that to
you.

Ludlow manages a rusty smile.
98.

LUDLOW
I believe you about your husband. I
think he was killed for his testimony.

Linda’s eyes well.

LUDLOW
What did he have, Mrs. Mody?

Ludlow’s asking for a huge leap of faith.

LUDLOW
I’m not sure what I’m walking into
tonight.

LINDA
(compelled)
He was going to expose some sort of money
skimming operation. He said it was
organized like any company. Different
stations coordinated... That’s all I
know.

Ludlow nods, his fears confirmed.

LUDLOW
I’1l get the rest.

INT. LOCKER ROOM, 77TH POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Ludlow dresses at his locker, like a Hall of Fame pitcher making
his last start. His routine is almost religious: a Kevlar vest,
a shoulder holster, a 9MM, ammunition, a two-inch .38 in his
back pocket...

Diskant is the only other man in the room. He armors up
quietly, appreciating the moment. Ludlow SEES Diskant
holster a simple 9MM; the young cop has come a long way.

DISKANT
You sure we don’t wanna roll with back-
up? Couple guys...?

LUDLOW

(wryly)
Which cops did you have in mind?

Diskant concedes the point.

LUDLOW
(low; razor-sharp)
Just wait ‘til you see the cash. Then we
can move.
(MORE)
99.
LUDLOW (cont'd)
(Diskant nods)
And look for the dope as soon as we get
in there. If they haven’t tested it...
that’s not good.

DISKANT
Wait - forget the cash. We got’em on
murder.

Diskant hands Ludlow a BAG of DOPE.
LUDLOW
No, we definitely do not. Their faces
were covered and somebody else...

BIGGS is standing at the end of the row, his IMPOSING
ASSISTANT behind him.

BIGGS
Back on the night, Tom? Weren’t grounded
very long, were you?

Ludlow gives Diskant a look, prompting the younger detective
to excuse himself.

BIGGS
(to Diskant)
Yeah, past your bed time boy.

DISKANT
Fuck you.

Ludlow cringes gleefully as Diskant carries on.

BIGGS
I know his name now, don’t I?

LUDLOW
(re: Biggs’ assistant)
Lose the shadow.
Biggs nods the man away.

BIGGS
So you two being seen all around town.

LUDLOW
It’s purely social.

Ludlow packs a BAG of HEROIN inside his jacket.

BIGGS
I’m surprised you’d be seen here.
100.

LUDLOW
Well, we had to come in for some dope.

BIGGS
(re: the bags)
That it?

LUDLOW
No, this I stole from a dealer I know.

Ludlow closes his locker, locked and loaded.

BIGGS
You really think I’m gonna do nothing
about you?

LUDLOW

Here’s what I really think Terrell. I
think for all your huffing and puffing,
you’re not quite ready to do my job.
You’re too good to go into your own
alleys...clean up the needles and baby
parts. You need me for all that. And
more importantly--

(face to face as he passes)
--you need me to blame.

BIGGS
Is this you working against them?

LUDLOW
I keep telling you Terrell. I don’t know
who they are.

Biggs gauges Ludlow’s sincerity.

BIGGS
But you’re waking up, son.
(calling after)
You keep my number Tom.

EXT. IMPERIAL COURTS, PROJECT APARTMENTS - LATER THAT NIGHT

A 16 year-old RUNNER carries a test bag away from Ludlow’s
Camaro. Scribble waits outside the car - Lud and Disco inside.

LUDLOW
(breaking the tension)
Y’alright teddy bear?
101.

SCRIBBLE
These is bad dudes, White. If they can’t
fuck it, rob it or kill it, they don’t
want it. Cats like that don’t like
getting ganked - ‘specially by someone
like me.

LUDLOW
Nobody’s getting ‘ganked’ Scribble. This
is a business deal.

Ludlow rolls the window up, turning subtly to Diskant.

LUDLOW
Jesus.

But Diskant is just as spooked as Scribble.

LUDLOW
Listen, Disco. I trust you to back me up.
Maybe you should do it from outside. I’m
not used to working with someone anyway.

Diskant turns curiously to Ludlow.

LUDLOW
This is all on their terms right now...
You don’t have to know the way I do.

DISKANT
(swallows)
No, this is my show. I’m including
myself. God knows I’m not gonna be part
of much else after this.

Ludlow half-smiles as Scribble KNOCKS on the window.

SCRIBBLE
Looks like your shit passed.

A LIGHT FLASHES out a fifth-story window.
SCRIBBLE
You gonna kill’em right?
INT. CORRIDOR - A SHORT TIME LATER
Scribble exhales, KNOCKS LOUDLY over music inside. Ludlow
waits behind him. His focus is in stark contrast to the

Ludlow we first met.

Diskant stares back, down a shadowy hall, as the DOOR OPENS...
Ludlow eases Scribble forward, almost like a shield.
102.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The apartment is a mixture of extravagance and filth. ONE OF
MODY’S KILLERS waits at a couch above a glass table.

Last in, Diskant looks around the opened door for the OTHER
KILLER when he feels the muzzle of a .38 against his temple.
[The gunman calls himself FREMONT, his partner COATES, so we
will too. ]

FREMONT
Move to the fucking wall.

SCRIBBLE
Nah, they cool man--

COATES
Shut the fuck up, Scribble!

Diskant doesn’t budge, but he’s about to lose his cool.

LUDLOW
Nobody’s unpacking anything. We’re here
to do business and we don’t do it blind.
(to Fremont)
You wanna feel my partner down, go ahead.
But he’s not taking it out for you.

A tense beat. Suddenly Coates breaks out laughing.

COATES
Oh shit! You wanna touch his junk
LaShawn?
(a grin with Ludlow)
Nigga take a seat at my table. You pass
that test. Chill the fuck out LaShawn,
Scribble say they cool.

Ludlow sits across from Coates, Diskant staying by the door.

COATES
Ain’t that right, Scribble?

SCRIBBLE
Yeah.

COATES
(mockingly)
Yeah. Make us some drinks teddy bear.

Teddy Bear. Ludlow’s nickname for Scribble. Ludlow peeks at
Diskant, but the younger detective is fixed on the TEST BAG...
it lies UNOPENED on a side table.
103.

COATES
Shoot, we got the po-po in da’ house.
Ain’t that some shit? Yo, there any
straight cops left?

Ludlow places the second BAG of HEROIN on the table.

COATES
S’up Po-po? Talking to you.

LUDLOW
Yeah, we’re the po-po.

COATES
You got a badge?

Ludlow tosses it to him. Coates flashes it at Fremont--

COATES
Yo nigga! You under arrest!

LUDLOW
Like I told Scribble, we’re not in this
for a quick score. We just wanted to
show you a few inefficiencies in your
system. It’s vulnerable, obviously.
We can protect you--

COATES
Shit, you cops is like weeds, you know
that? You pull one out, two more grow in.

LUDLOW
(carefully now)
Well, Mody probably got greedy.

Ludlow waits... no reaction from Coates.

LUDLOW
We’re not trying to get rich here. We

just wanna put away a little on the side
for our families...

COATES
Yeah, you thinking Bahamas someday?
‘Bahamas’... The Mody's plans... Ludlow is thrown.
LUDLOW

What’s that now?
104.

COATES
You know: better cars, better trips--
(at Diskant)
--better honeymoons.

Diskant - engagement ring on his finger - want out of this
room. Ludlow, on the other hand, is suddenly distracted by--

THE 50 cal. MACHINE GUN (from our opening), sitting in a back
corner. It’s a kind of altar, wrapped in small white lights.
However it got here, it mesmerizes Ludlow.

DISKANT
Ludlow...

FREMONT
Yo, check this Wade.
(Ludlow’s badge)
Ain’t this the nigga from the market that
day?

COATES
(a slow burn)
Goddamn. That was you wasn’t it?
Ludlow. That why you here? You want
some revenge for that nigga?

LUDLOW
You did me a fucking favor that day. I
just want to know who else I should thank.

Scribble sweats in a corner of the room.

COATES
(dead serious)
You that good, po-po? You know there was
someone else?

SCRIBBLE
c’mon fellas, let’s sample their shit.

COATES
Shut the fuck up Scribble.

DISKANT
(overlapping)
Ludlow...
Ludlow finally turns to Diskant.

DISKANT
There’s no cash coming out--
105.

BLAM! Coates has shot Diskant in the head... The young
detective is DEAD BEFORE HE HITS THE GROUND.

Ludlow dives behind the couch. Stuffing punches out all
around him. He FIRES wildly back, the dealers retreating.

FREMONT ducks into a BATHROOM off to one side, COATES into a
KITCHEN off to the other.

The sounds of Hispanic women SCREAMING through the walls.

Ludlow’s hands shake as he reloads. Near to him, Diskant’s
lifeless eyes cast into the dirty carpet.

FREMONT
You under arrest po-po!

Ludlow EMPTIES a CLIP, diving to a nearby closet.

Crumpled on the floor, Scribble clutches his bleeding abdomen.
Ludlow, Fremont and Coates can’t see each other, but they can
all see Scribble.

COATES
Scribble, pick that gun the fuck up and
shoot that mothafucka!

Scribble sees Diskant’s gun lying on the floor. He ignores
it when... BLAM! A shot from the kitchen tears into his calf.

COATES
Next one peels your cap nigga!

Scribble fumbles the gun into his shaking hand.

LUDLOW
Cedric, don’t fucking do it!

COATES
‘Cedric’? What that? Your slave name?
You best fuckin’ do it!

Aimed at Ludlow, Scribble slowly lowers the gun. He can’t do
it. He’s instantly RIDDLED WITH BULLETS from the kitchen.

Peeking around the corner, Ludlow sees Fremont advance to the
couch. Fremont FIRES, covering Coates as he crosses to the
bathroom. They’re like a trained combat unit, positioning for
the kill.

Running out of options, Ludlow keys on the BAGS of HEROIN. He
takes careful aim, POPPING BOTH BAGS and filling the air with
CHINA WHITE.
106.

With a deep breath, Ludlow wades into the CLOUDY ROOM. He’s
WINGED by a shot, but keeps moving forward...

FREMONT’S POV: he’s unable to see two feet in front of him,
until... LUDLOW’S RIGHT THERE.

BLAM! Fremont’s gone.

Coates is caught reloading in the narrow kitchen when Ludlow
aims and FIRES...

CLUNK. His 9MM jams. Coates is ready. He FIRES as LUDLOW
ducks behind the fridge. As Ludlow withstands the shots - the
FRIDGE denting - he eyes Diskant on the ground. Dead and gone.

COATES
You done Ludlow! I do you like I did him!

Ludlow’s temper seems to boil - he’s had enough of this - as
he PUSHES THE FRIDGE like a linebacker in a football drill.
He drives it right into Coates, pinning him against the wall.

In a heartbeat, Ludlow pulls the snub-nose from his back pocket -
scales the fridge - and FIRES DOWN through Coates’ skull.

Ludlow slides down off the fridge, totally spent. He goes to
Coates, checking his pockets, desperate for any clue...

LUDLOW
Who?

..-But there’s nothing. Nothing to go on. He has failed.

EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow drags Diskant out, propping him gently against the
wall. He sits beside him... unable to look at his friend.

SIRENS in the distance. Ludlow takes a deep breath - rises -
and walks away...

EXT. MEGAN’S HOME - NIGHT

Ludlow limps up steps, bleeding from his shoulder down his
sleeve. Megan opens the door before he knocks, her face

covered in tears.

LUDLOW
Why are you crying?

She almost smiles, helping him inside.
107.

INT. MEGAN’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow sits on the floor, back against her couch. Megan
rushes out of the bathroom, tape and gauze in her hands.

LUDLOW
.»-jJust wanted a name. We couldn’t get it.

He pulls his arm away from her.

MEGAN
Just let me do this.

Megan tries to compose herself as she wraps the bandage.

MEGAN
(trying to convince
herself)
It’s gonna be okay. It’s gonna be okay.

LUDLOW
She’1ll get nothing.

MEGAN
What?

LUDLOW
She doesn’t get a pension ‘cause they
didn’t do it yet. She’s probably still

sleeping.

MEGAN
Lud, just take it easy. What are you
saying?

LUDLOW

I walked him in there.
(turns to her)
It went bad Megan.

Megan’s still crying her own tears.

MEGAN
I know.

LUDLOW
(recurring to him)
Wait, why were you crying?

Megan looks back at her TV, on in the background.
108.

MEGAN
They called me to cover it. I didn’t go
because it was you.

Ludlow drags himself to the TV: helicopter images of the
IMPERIAL COURTS BUILDINGS. Then a graphic appears:

LUDLOW’ S ACADEMY PHOTOGRAPH. He looks young in his blues,
his eyes clear and hopeful.

A REPORTER and ANALYST go back and forth over the images--

ANALYST’S VOICE (ON TV)
...the loss of his wife last year. He’s
had a history of violence and complaints
against him that have made him a well-
known figure in this community. But this -
you don’t see something like this coming.

REPORTER’S VOICE (ON TV)
Again, the details just coming in...
Detective Tom Ludlow, a twenty-year man
on the force...wanted for the slaying of
two undercover officers in the early
hours this morning.

Two more Academy photographs replace Ludlow’s:

TWO YOUNG, CLEAN-CUT BLACK OFFICERS... the men representing
themselves as dealers Fremont and Coates.

REPORTER’S VOICE (ON TV)
Ludlow and Detective Paul Diskant were
attempting to sell a large quantity of
narcotics to the undercover officers when
the shooting occurred.

Ludlow is simply...destroyed. A ticker runs along the bottom
of the screen:

COP WANTED IN SLAYING OF THREE FELLOW OFFICERS.

REPORTER’S VOICE (ON TV)
Detective Ludlow is at large and also
wanted for questioning in the murder of
Officer Gilbert Mody, killed last week in
a Korea Town grocery...

MEGAN
Lud? Lud?

Megan watches Ludlow disintegrate.
109.

MEGAN
We won’t let them, Lud. You can fight
this. Please don’t give in like this.
(crying)
Please, you’re scaring me...

LUDLOW

You don’t understand...
MEGAN

Tell me.
LUDLOW

I should’ve known they were cops; I

couldn’t see it... I couldn’t think it.
(then)

All I saw were two...

MEGAN
No, I know it’s not true. People will
listen, Lud. What are you gonna do--

LUDLOW
(resignedly)
No. There’s only ‘how it looks’.

Now, finally, Megan quiets. She looks about...lost. Then--A
KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ludlow suddenly panics.

LUDLOW
(the bandages)
Get these off me.

MEGAN
What?
MAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
Police!
LUDLOW
You don’t want me here. You didn’t open
the door!

He tears off his bandages, handing them to her.

MEGAN
No, I don’t want to do this--

LUDLOW
(for all to hear)
Open the fucking door!
(to her)
You gotta scream Megan. Do it or they’1l
kill you.
110.

MEGAN
What?

He SLAPS HER hard. She cries as he SHOVES HER into her bedroom.

LUDLOW

Do it!
MEGAN

Tell me you’1l meet me at the station.
LUDLOW

(shaking her)

Scream!

MEGAN

No! Tell me...

It’s an isolated, peaceful millisecond between them.

LUDLOW
Alright... Now fucking scream.
MEGAN
(blood-curdling)

Help!!

She slams the door between them, just as - BOOM! - the FRONT
DOOR is kicked in.

SHONEY and DEMILLE advance, guns on Ludlow.

BOTH MEN
Down! On the fucking floor Ludlow!

Ludlow drops to his knees, hands on his head.

LUDLOW
You fucking bitch!

DEMILLE
Shut up!

Shoney throws Ludlow down, taking his piece and cuffing him.
DeMille KICKS IN Megan’s door, finding her crying on the floor,
cell phone to her ear... A trickle of blood on her mouth.

MEGAN
Oh, thank God.
DeMille stares a calculating beat... Then lowers his gun.
DEMILLE

It’s alright honey. You’re alright now.
111.

SHONEY
Let’s go.

DeMille reluctantly peels his eyes off Megan.

DEMILLE
Alright. Get him up and out.

Megan watches tearfully as Ludlow’s led roughly off.

EXT. CALIFONIA DESERT - LATER THAT NIGHT

DeMille’s sedan cruises along an open freeway, away from the
city lights.

INT. DEMILLE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Ludlow rides in the backseat, his head resting against the
window. He’s resigned now... No fight left.

He takes in the passing terrain...sand and brush in the
moonlight. His eyes catch DeMille’s in the rearview mirror.

DEMILLE

(to Shoney; re: Megan)
Not the most loyal girl, was she? Gimme
some tips Ludlow. How do I console that
hot reporter ass after you’re gone?

(then)
c’mon. I know you whisper all sorts of
sweet things to Mody's widow.

Shoney turns around to Ludlow.

SHONEY
You fuck’em both, right? Which one you
like better?

DEMILLE
(no more jokes)
Shouldn’t have given her that tape Lud.

LUDLOW
The fuck are you talking about?

SHONEY
(to DeMille)
Take it easy--

DEMILLE
No, I want him to know before we do it.
Smug fuckin’ prick.

(MORE)
112.

DEMILLE (cont'd)
You figure it out yet? How Fremont and
Coates made it to the market that day?

Very slowly, Ludlow slides his handcuffs from behind his back
to under his thighs...

LUDLOW
You killed them instead of arrest them.

DEMILLE
They hadn’t made it a mile out of the
station before we picked’em back up and
peeled their fucking caps.

SHONEY
No papers, no friends, no relatives.
(turns to Ludlow)
It was my idea.

DEMILLE
Anyway, a little hair, a little blood.
It’s the ultimate get-outta-jail card.
(xvhetorically)
Gotta get rid of a rat piece of shit like
Mody? ‘Fremont and Coates did it.’

SHONEY
You ruined a very good thing for us boy.

Very subtly, Ludlow lifts his knees, trying to get his hands
in front of himself.

DEMILLE
We gave you a lot of rope on this one
Ludlow. We even let Mody's widow live
this long with what she knows... And she
fucking knows with that pussy-boy husband
of hers. But you’ve fucked that up for
both of you now.

SHONEY
Guess whose hair and blood’s gonna be all
over her place?
(to DeMille)
Shit, maybe we should have him rape her
too.

DEMILLE
(howling)
Ho, I’1l let you handle that!

In one motion, Ludlow clears the handcuffs under his feet and
THROWS THEM AROUND DeMILLE’S NECK. He hangs on - like an
animal that won’t release it’s hold - as Shoney bashes his
skull.
113.

DeMille swerves on the freeway as Shoney HAMMERS the butt end
of his 9MM into Ludlow’s head - again and again - until
finally, as the LAST BLOW impacts, we--

cuT TO BLACK

EXT. DRUG SHACK, PALMDALE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ludlow’s eyes open slowly... his blood congeals on dusty
concrete. He’s lying on his cheek. OLEANDER BRUSH waves in
the BRIGHT MOONLIGHT.

DeMille’s suddenly in his face, swabbing blood from his scalp
into a VIAL. He speaks softly, triumphantly, in Ludlow’s ear--

DEMILLE
Aw, poor Tommy. I know what you’re
really wondering. How could they leave
me out?

Ludlow coughs, choking on his own blood.

DEMILLE
You were almost approached, you know. If
you can believe that. But you were just
too selfish to be trusted. Just a low-
class drunken loud mouth out for himself.
(then; rising)
You should’ve kept more friends, Ludlow.

DeMille leaves Ludlow on the ground, taking the vial inside.

Ludlow’s eyes dart about - looking for a play - but his body
is unresponsive. He wilts without moving... It’s all over.

Then, a WIND picks up, ruffling the OLEANDER BRUSH before
him. Still handcuffed, Ludlow’s breathing rises...his face
flushes...he’s not ready to quit just yet.

He begins crawling, still handcuffed, towards the brush.

DEMILLE
(kidding around)
Hey, Shones!! Get out here! He’s making
a run for it!

The FIRST SHOT explodes in the sand by Ludlow’s ear. The
brush is still fifteen feet away...

SHONEY
Where you going Lud?!
114.

BLAM! Another shot near Ludlow’s hip. They FIRE over and
over, toying with Ludlow. A BULLET rips into his calf.

CLOSE on LUDLOW. Not done yet. FIVE FEET to the brush.

DEMILLE
He’s gonna bury himself!

MORE SHOTS in the sand all around him... TWO FEET... Then,
drawing from way down, he finds the strength to scurry into
the thick brush.

DeMille looks partly flustered, mainly annoyed.

SHONEY
Let’s just do him and get going.

INSIDE THE BRUSH,

Ludlow crawls through SWARMING RED ANTS... he’s going towards
the BURIAL HOLE... And, just beyond it... DISKANT’S SHOVEL.

DEMILLE
This is it Lud. I’m not gonna say I
haven’t enjoyed this, but I’1l make it
quick for you.

He finds Ludlow on his back, exhausted, hands over his head.
DeMille gets right on top of him... He raises his gun...

When Ludlow’s hands extend from the brush, bringing the SHOVEL
to DeMille’s forehead.

Shoney charges into the brush, FIRING at Ludlow as he drags
DeMille backwards, the two of them folding INTO THE GRAVE.

Shoney gets overtop of the grave, FIRING down... From beneath
the cover of DeMille, Ludlow SHOOTS STRAIGHT UP, killing
Shoney instantly...

.--Using his feet, Ludlow pushes DeMille out of the grave.
Then, summoning all his strength, he LIFTS HIMSELF OUT...

He coughs up dirt and blood...back from the dead.

INT. LINDA MODY'S HOME - NIGHT

Linda walks through her living room - still littered with
boxes and flowers - to answer her front door. She opens it--

Finding Clady on her doorstep. He smiles over the chain lock...
115.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WANDER’S HOME - NIGHT

Wander sits in his robe - middle of the night - glued to the
television. It’s as if Ludlow’s story, still breaking news,
has sucked the life out of him. We stay on him, over--

ANCHOR’S VOICE (ON TV)
As far as we know Officer Ludlow is still
at large. Again, a police spokesperson
saying Ludlow is to be considered armed
and dangerous.

CO-ANCHOR’S VOICE (ON TV)
Strange to hear the police use that kind
of terminology on one of their own.

ANCHOR’S VOICE (ON TV)
Absolutely...

INT. LINDA MODY'S HOME - NIGHT

A CABINET smashes as Clady chases Linda through her home. He
pins her in a corner, her nose already dripping with blood.

CLADY
This place is a fucking mess, you know
that? Where is it? Huh? Where’s the
fucking tape?
(slaps her viciously)
Look at you - getting your nigger blood
all over me.

Linda turns her head away, trying to imagine herself
somewhere else. Clady glimpses a VCR atop of a moving box.

CLADY
Is that a VCR?

Released for a moment, Linda slides down the wall, into a
heap. As Clady checks the VCR - smashing it when he finds it
empty - Linda glimpses LUDLOW looking in a window.

Linda’s head falls forward - a kind of exhausted, euphoric
release. She knows her trial is over.

None the wiser, Clady returns to her - angrier than ever. He
picks her up, momentarily bemused as she smiles through tears.

CLADY
You’re a tough a little cunt, aren’t you?
Tougher than that husband of yours.
(MORE)
116.

CLADY (cont'd)
(then)
What’s so funny? Huh?

LINDA
Bye bye now.

One second Clady is there, the next - as if hit by a bus -
he’s gone. Ludlow tackles him to the floor, wrenching the
air from his lungs and BREAKING HIS ARM as he cuffs him.

Linda turns away as Clady howls.

EXT. LINDA MODY'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Ludlow drags an unconscious Clady to his ‘requisitioned’
vehicle (Shoney and DeMille’s unmarked car). He stuffs the
Sergeant into the trunk as Linda watches from her doorstep.

LUDLOW
You gotta go now Linda. Wherever it is,
you have to go.
LINDA
(wryly)
I’m already packed.
Ludlow takes the cue, slowing for a moment.

LUDLOW
I found them. The men who killed--

LINDA
I know who you mean.

LUDLOW
Well, I wanted to arrest them, but...it
didn’t work out that way.
Linda recovers from the news, still in tatters.

LINDA
Take care of yourself Officer.

Ludlow nods, bittersweetly. Nothing left to say.

LUDLOW
Goodnight.

A cell phone is RINGING... from inside the trunk. Ludlow
opens it, grabbing CLADY’S PHONE...

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
Yeah.
117.

MAN’S VOICE (FROM PHONE)
Jesus, nobody’s answering - what’s going
on out there? Is it over or not?
Ludlow goes pale.

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
Terry?

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. KITCHEN, WANDER’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

Phone to his ear, Wander stands over his sink, staring into
his backyard. He’s just as speechless.

WANDER (ON PHONE)
Lud?

Wander sets down a coffee mug.

WANDER (ON PHONE)
Where’s Clady?

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
Trunk.

WANDER (ON PHONE)
Shoney and DeMille?

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
Palmdale.

Ludlow takes a breath, begins to process. He smiles bitterly.

LUDLOW (ON PHONE)
I guess you all had me right... I never
could see a move ahead.

WANDER (ON PHONE)
Now listen. Before you do anything else...
We should talk. You owe me that much....
Lud?

EXT. WANDER’S HOME - EARLY DAWN
Ludlow drives over the curb, onto the grass. He’s brought
Wander’s whole scheme back to him, and parked it on his front

lawn.

Ludlow pulls his 9MM, retrieved from Shoney’s dead body,
sliding his hand along the rack. He clears the chamber, then--
118.

DROPS OUT the clip... Contemplates the bullets.

INT. WANDER’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Ludlow enters cautiously, weapon drawn.

WANDER (0.S.)
Hell of a parking job.

Ludlow follows the voice, limping to the--
KITCHEN
Wander sits passively, TWO COFFEES on the kitchen table.

LUDLOW
Put your hands on the table.

Wander obliges, nothing - apparently - up his sleeve.

WANDER
Sit down, you can still point that at me.

Ludlow’s head swivels, watching his own back.

WANDER
It’s just you and me.

And so...Ludlow joins him at the table.

WANDER
You wearing a wire?

LUDLOW
Just you and me.

WANDER
-..It started with a hundred dollars.
We were tangling with thugs that had
better armor than us. I stole a hundred
dollars to get a better vest.

Ludlow’s listening...but he’s also digging in his jacket.
He places SHONEY’S BADGE on the table.

WANDER
The lawsuits started about the same time
in this state.
(bitterly)
Sue anybody for anything. Especially
cops.
(then)
They went after Silky personally.
(MORE)
119.
WANDER (cont'd)
Took his home from him... The rest of us
started pooling together.

Ludlow places DeMILLE’S BADGE on the table.

WANDER
The suits got bigger so we started
skimming more. Even if we weren’t in
trouble we’d just keep pooling together,
just to be ready for the next one.

CLADY’S BADGE on the table.

WANDER
Got to be that, when we were in the
black, we’d pay out here and there.
Nobody’s buying yachts or summer homes.
Just a natural correction in a flawed
system. Christ, Lud, if teachers could
do it they would too.

LUDLOW
That help you sleep at night?

WANDER
Fuck you.
(the badges)
What are those? Scalps?

For old time’s sake, Ludlow makes his ‘keep going’ gesture--

LUDLOW
Keep going. I want to hear you get to
the part where we murder, and deal, and
kill other cops.

WANDER
(mock innocence)
I don’t know what you mean.

LUDLOW
Mody.

WANDER
Not a cop.

LUDLOW

Fuck you - be a man. You put them on me.

WANDER
I held them off you - long as I could.
I had to put you down, Lud. You don’t
listen. I’ve given you so much rope...
(darkly)
You don’t know what you are, do you?
120.

LUDLOW
I know my part in this.

WANDER

Do you Lud? C’mon...those kids in Little
Saigon? You could’ve waited for backup;
they weren’t going anywhere. But you
didn’t like’em. So you killed’em. And
the world’s a better place for it.

(then)
You decided what justice was, and I
backed you. Because I trust you know
right from wrong. That’s how it works...
Or you’re a killer.

Ludlow teases the trigger on his 9MM.

LUDLOW
Forget it. Forget the drugs and the money.
(astounded; offended)
You got cops killing cops. You got me
killing cops. And then you come after me?
(quiet, blistering rage)
After everything. The four of us around
this table, huh? When did this start
making sense to you?

WANDER
You wanna make this personal. I understand
that. But you were just in the way.

LUDLOW
Of what? Your corporation.

WANDER
of a system that was working Tom.
Everybody happy. We did the job on the
street and took care of our own. You and
Mody fucked that up.

LUDLOW
All for a little green?

WANDER
I’m the father of a very large family.
And we’ve gotta survive Tom. Welcome to
the big picture.

LUDLOW
No. No more big picture. No more
‘changing with the times’. We’re not

going with your version this time.
121.

WANDER
Our version.

Ludlow nods, conceding his part in their play.

WANDER
I allow you to exist Lud. You tear me
down you make us both extinct. Ten years
- we’ll all be like firemen. Just
sitting around waiting for phone calls
because it’s too risky - too expensive to
go out and stop something.

Ludlow smiles sadly. Wander takes it for defeat.

WANDER
You’re not gonna ruin us both.

LUDLOW
I’m saved Terry... Even if I’m as fucked
as you are.

Ludlow pulls a LAST BADGE out of his pocket.

LUDLOW
This one’s Diskant’s.

Ludlow just holds it there, letting it burn into Wander.
From total surrender, Wander moves slowly to rage...

WANDER
I’m not going through this. The media,
the bullshit system, like some Joe Public
schmuck. You want to end me, then you do
it. You owe me that!

Ludlow smiles as he rises; he’s not going to shoot Wander.
Wander sprays his coffee over Ludlow, TOSSING THE TABLE.

WANDER
Fuck you! This is what you want, then
you be a man and do it!

Ludlow stands his ground, dripping. He stares into his old
friend’s eyes, and places his 9MM on the counter.

LUDLOW
I’m done killing cops. And you don’t know
better than those schmucks, you arrogant
prick.

Wander sobs as Ludlow turns away. Then... Ludlow HEARS a
‘CLICK’. He turns to find Wander pointing his 9MM at him.
122.

WANDER
All you do is make heroes Lud. First
Mody... Those nigger cops you killed
tonight... And now me. For stopping you.

LUDLOW
You’re gonna do it yourself now?

WANDER
Self-defense Lud. You’re a crazed killer.

Ludlow’s rage builds as Wander tightens on the trigger...
WANDER
It was me by the way. I took her to the
hospital that night. Should’ve been you.
(then; finally)
I was fucking your wife Tom.
Ludlow absorbs what he’s always wondered...and always known.

LUDLOW
I know.

Still aimed at Ludlow, Wander PULLS THE TRIGGER...
CLICK. Nothing. CLICK. CLICK. The magazine is empty.

WANDER
You gotta be kidding...

Ludlow begins rolling up his sleeves.

LUDLOW
That felt personal.

Wander drops the gun, rolling up his own sleeves. Both men
wait until the other is ready. And then, with a shared nod...

BOOM! They collide like two rams, locking and grappling.
SOUND DROPS OUT, except for their BREATHING. They snort and
gasp as each lands CRUSHING BLOWS...

There’s absolutely nothing sexy about it. This is what it
takes to be Ludlow; what nobody out there wants to know about.

He lands ONE MORE BLOW than his old friend, overpowering him.
He turns Wander over, cuffing him--

WANDER
No! No! Wo!

Ludlow slumps against the wall. Out of breath, bleeding
everywhere. He slowly, painfully pulls out his phone.
123.

LUDLOW (INTO PHONE)
This is 41 Adam. Officer down. 408 Oak
street... Send rescue.

EXT. WANDER’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Biggs waits patiently, leaning on the hood of DeMille’s
sedan. He watches Ludlow hobble out of Wander’s house...

BIGGS
Rough night?

LUDLOW
First on scene?

BIGGS
Came as soon as you called. I was hoping
it’d be you that walked out.

LUDLOW
Just sit back and let us all kill each
other. That the idea?

BIGGS

You’re not all the same to me Ludlow.
(sincerely)
You’re not them.

Ludlow’s too tired to react. SIRENS near.

BIGGS
Self-defense? It’s all ‘how it sounds’,
you know?

LUDLOW

Whatever you say boss.

BIGGS
You got keys to this thing? There’s
somebody in the trunk I wouldn’t mind
speaking with.

Ludlow tosses him the keys, hobbling off on his way.

BIGGS
Where you walking son?

As TWO BLACK AND WHITE’S pull up, Biggs holds up his badge -
shielding Ludlow.
124.

INT. 77TH POLICE STATION - DAY

The busy station comes to a grinding halt...as LUDLOW WALKS IN.
He limps down the long hallway - no one making a sound.

He stares up at a DESK SERGEANT, who knowingly points him
down the hall, deeper into the lion’s den.

At the end, he finds MEGAN standing plaintively at a high desk.
She turns from the clerk ignoring her... FINDING LUDLOW...

Megan gathers her purse, composes herself, and walks to his
side. They don’t touch or speak - but she sees that he’s
still there... still in one piece. And that makes her smile.
Ludlow manages his own, bloody version of one in return.

CREDITS over their long walk out.

THE END
