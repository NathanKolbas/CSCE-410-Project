Back in the audience, Spottswoode opens a business folder.
The name on the folder reads ‘Gary Johnston’ with a small
black and white photo of the LEASE singer clipped to it.

Spettswoode looks from the name to the actor on stage.

Thunderous applause from the audience. Spottswoeode suts the
folder back down and claps wildly himself.

Gary stands on the stage, soaking in all the applause. He
LOVES the attention.

But then, he keys in on two empty seats in the audience,
right in the front row.

Gary's smile drops a little, as he hones in
seats.

how PEACEFUL we try to be, che
will ALWAYS be others who want
