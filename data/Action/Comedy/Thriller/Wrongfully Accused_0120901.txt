EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
CASS LAKE hears the sirens. Beautiful, cool, in control, the
girl next-door with the body of a Victoria's Secret model.
And an air of mystery about her. She grabs her binoculars.

‘The penitentiary with a person jumping over the wall. Cass
looks through her binocs.

EXT. UTILITY ROAD ~- PRISON TRUCK - DAY

The side of the truck reads: "A Prison Truck". In the b.g.
off in the distance is the penitentiary where a break has
just been discovered. In the flatbed are barrels, over-
stuffed, and marked “Recycled Paper“, “Recycled Cans",
“Recycled Plastic", and "Recycled Cycles", which is full of
old bicycles. One barrel, which is marked "For Escaping". has
a pair of hands holding onto the rim. The person inside
starts to rock the barrel until it falls off the truck.

Rolls down a hill. Passes a sign: “The Steepest Hill In The
Whole World".

The world is spinning as we roll downhill.
EXT. HILLSIDE

Cass is packing up her paints. Delicate brushes and big paint
vollers.
EXT. CREEK - DAY

The barrel comes to a halt in the creek. Our PRISONER crawls
out of the barrel, we don't see his face. Dizzy, on very
unsteady legs, he staggers all over, banging into tree, 4
bridge embankment, then bumps heads with a BEAR whe is just
rounding a corner, ow! Beast and man fall backward out of
frame, leaves flying back up into view as they strike the

INT. BACK ROOM - PRISONER'S POV OF CEILING

A moan, and we stare at the ceiling. Look to the wall. A
doctor's license hanging on the wall for *Dr Yanock Savack*
has a big red circle with a red bar through the middle on it.
We turn back and we look into the face of DOCTOR SAVACK.
Tired, worn-face@ drinker and smoker. He wears a white
pharmacist's type coat. Cigarette dangles from his lips. A
little smoker's cough. He's going through a wallet.

ANGLE - SAVACK

SAVACK
I'm Yanock Savack.

Our escaped prisoner, the young, handsome cameo is our .
escapee, ROBERT DECKER. Tries to get up off the barber chair,
but he's too woozy.

SAVACK
Ssh. You're safe, Mr Robert
Decker. I found out who you
are.

Savack looks at several photos of a woman, Mary Kelley, red
hair, very pretty. She holds onto, and stands behind, 4-
picket fence. Another photo and we see she is actually |
holding onto a small section of a fence, which is about the
size of an accordion. Is Savack taken by her beauty, oF does
he recognize her?

SAVACK
Girlfriend?
Decker grabs the photo.
DECKER

Mary Kelley. I loved her. She
set me up. I'm innocent. I
never smuggled guns into
Northern Ireland.

SAVACK
Guilty, net guilty, it doesn’t
matter to me. Someone found
you. Brought you here.

DECKER
A bear?

SAVACK
She left no name. But did give
mé thirty-five hundred
dollars. I'm a self taught
cosmetic surgeon.

Savack washes his hands in the greasy water of a sink full of
dishes.

SAVACK

I'll aiter your voice by

(very special)
No more fingerprints. They'll
never give you away. The
downside is fingerprints act

He turns on a tank labeled "Nitrous Oxide Lite’.

"Before and After" pictures hang on the wall. Before is Abe
Vigeda. The after is Tom Cruise. Then a before of Michael
Jackson from his "Jackson Five" days. Then a series of four
after pictures, taking us through his various changes. Savack
places the mask over Decker's face.

He starts to unravel the bandages.

SAVACK {Cont'd}
You're going to feel a

a little skin from my dog's

Ryan's feet walking mile after mile of sidewalk, up stairs,
down stairs, circular stairs, trying to walk up an escalator.
All the while pages are falling off a daily calendar. We
start in July. We eventually reach July 32nd.

A motorcycle cop looks his way.

RYAN (V.0.)
A cop. Be safe Ryan. Don't
draw any attention to
yourself.

Ryan acts casual and stands behind an outdoor fruit stand.
His positioning makes it look like the banana and pears are
his exposed genitalia. No one can help but stare at him.

RYAN (V.0.)
Everyone's staring. Quick,
lose yourself in a crowd,
blend in.

Ryan is morphed into footage of the Million Man March crowd.
As the crowd listens to Farakan, Ryan looks over his shoulder
for the cop. All heads turn to this one shiny white face in
the middle of the crowd.

That's right Ryan, lose

Ryan tightens, straining hard to draw it very taut. There.
The percussionist strikes the timpani with his mallet. Ryan
tightened it too tight, "“boing!". The mallet bounces back
with great force, hitting the percussionist in the face.

Ryan is sharpening the conductor's baton in a pencil
sharpener.

Ryan carrying a harp. He doesn't realize it's too big for the
doorway opening. It jams in the door. Ryan keeps walking into
the strings, “sproing’”, he's shot backwards out of frame.

Sound of a mechanic at work, hammering, drilling: "*Clang!
Weez weez! Crank". Ryan in greasy overalls, slides from under
a piano on a crawler. Lifts the piano top, coils a hinge, but
in the process clipping Mr "Shine" himself, DAVID HELFGOTT,
smoking, shirtless, wearing long coat, walkman in ear, and
wearing headphones, acting very hyper, on the chin. He fails
into the piano. Ryan drops the piano top back down, leaving
Helfgott entombed.

Emptying trash from after a rehearsal. He sees a violin ina
trash can. He reverently picks it up. It feels right, it
feels so natural. "Wonder Boy" is wood-burned on the back.
He picks up a bow.

RYAN (V.C.)
You studied violin as a boy.
You played in the prison
orchestra. It kept you sane.

ANGLE - ON DECK CIRCLE - BASEBALL PLAYER (CAMEO)

Kneeling, he’s applying resin to his bat. Ryan gestures for

EXT. POOL - DAY

Cass sits on a pool chair. Ryan applies suntan lotion, a let
more comes squirting out than he anticipated. He rubs it on
her back, it runs all over. She leans back in the chair, but
due to the greased-up back, she slips off the chair, and down
a hillside.

INT. ELEVATOR AT SYMPHONY HALL

Ryan and Cass enter. She is all over him. Kissing, working
her way down his chest, then out of frame. We can only
imagine what she is doing as he reacts in total ecstasy,
flailing his arms, pounding his fist on the wall, banging his
head.

EXT. SYMPHONY HALL - A SUMMER'S EVENING
SUPER: THREE MONTHS LATER

What a night! The musical event of the year. A sign proudly
proclaims: "Mr. and Mrs. Hibbing Goodhue Present the Concert
Debut of Ryan Harrison". A poster of the handsome,
distinguished Ryan Harrison, the former Robert Decker, is
posed playing his violin. A "Solid Out" banner is placed over
the poster.

ANGLE - SYMPHONY HALL ENTRANCE

Late, stepping from a cab, is Cass. She's dressed elegantly.
Including long opera gloves. She goes past séveral black
SCALPERS, who approach her.

SCALPERS
I got loge, I got center
aisle...

INT. SYMPHONY HALL - ANGLE ON CASS

Loads of sparkling jewelry, formal gowns and tuxedos, the .
cream of society. Cass is taken to her seat by an usher, who
flicks on his flashlight which emits the static hum and the
florescent light of Darth Vader's sword. He points to her
seat. She opens her handbag, a small gun inside. She takes
out a note addressed to "Hibbing Goodhue". The usher gestures
to the empty theater box, giving her the note back. She draws
a glance to Goodhue's theater box. We can't help notice that
Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln are sitting in the
adjoining box, watching happily. Cass is drawn to the music.

ANGLE - RYAN

A confidant, mature,-debonair Ryan. He's playing flawlessly.
It's so obvious the hands do not belong to our actor. He
plays so vigorously that he jabs his bow into the eye of a
fellow orchestra member, “Awi". Then an angle reveals several
musicians behind Ryan are wearing an eye patch. One woman is
in a football helmet with dark visor.

ANGLE ~ CASS

Tt's her! He's not happy to see her. it affects him, he

 

unintentionally hooks his bow in a violin string, it draws
back, the bow acts like an arrow, it jes 0.c., "Pingggg:”.

 

Up and into the orchestra. Without missing a beat. Ryan takes
another bow from a quiver on his back, doesn't miss a note.
He's back to total concentration.

ANGLE - CASS

Cass checks her watch. One last look to the box. Angry, she
tears up the note.

ANGLE - RYAN FROM BEHIND

Playing. We see Cass leaving. In the f.g. the percussionist,
with Ryan's bow lodged in his chest, staggers by camera.

ANGLE - RYAN

His hair, and a huge amount of hair, is flopping to and fro
as he plays. He sees a rather upset Cass exit the theater.

EXT. GOODHUE SEASIDE HOME - SHORELINE - SIMULTANEOUS ~- NIGHT

WE HEAR the faint sound of Ryan's playing from the house.
HIBBING GOODHUE, handsome, mustached tycoon, dressed in
formal wear, a successful British businessman, sips his tea.
Looks out to sea. A storm is brewing on the horizon. Seals
swim off in the surf, lie on the rocks. But there's something
else about this stretch of water. He consults a map. He's
discovered a secret. He looks through a pair of binoculars.
We see an image reflected in the lens, a small sub rises out
of the water. Hibbing lowers the binoculars. He heads back to
the house.

EXT. GOODHUE TRAM - NIGHT

Hibbing is riding it up to the house. The music becoming
louder. He crumples Ryan's concert tickets. Faint THUNDER.

INT. GOODHUE HOME
Hibbing is annoyed by the music. He turns the radio station.

NEWSCASTER (RADIO}
The UN Secretary General, Sir
Robert McKintyre, will be in
Columbia Heights to give his
anti-terrorist speech.
14

Hibbing smiles, how.fortuitous, this only con
suspicion.

 

NEWSCASTER (RADIO}
Sir McKintyre is instrumencal
in getting the UN to actually
do something. He's advocating
that the world body form an
international military action
force, whose sole objective is
to wipe out terrorist training
bases around the world. He
will be arriving on the
twelfth of this month.

Hibbing looks to the calendar. It reads: ‘This Monch” and the
number "10". He tosses down the map. A red circle indicates a
point offshore where the sub surfaced, and the word:
"Hylander". And a series of numbers.

ANGLE - BAR

Hibbing mixes a drink. The station is turned back to Ryan's
concert. Surprised, he turns. Sees someone 0.C.

HIBBING

You've deceived me, haven't
you my dear? The murder of the
plastic surgeon meant nothing
to me. He deserved it. But you
never loved me. I was just
being used for my status and
connections. You're going to
kill the UN Secretary General,
the assassin is coming off a
sub out there on my quiet
shoreline. But you're not
going to get away with it.

The radio is cranked up loud, louder.

HIBBING (Cont'd)
Turn that damnable radio off!

EXT. GOODHUE SHORELINE ~- NIGHT

A dark figure, SEAN LAUGHREA, craggy faced, powerfully built,
lands ashore in a Zodiac. WE HEAR the faint sound of the —
Goodhue's RADIO and Ryan‘’s concert, and a GUNSHOT. The dark
figure pulls a long knife from his sheath. His move brings 4
tiny “squeak" frem his elbow. He speaks into a headset.

A second terrorist, in black balaklava, scurries back inside.
He pulls a huge bathtub stopper over the hatch opening. Water
rushes over it as the sub submerges.

ANGLE - SEAN

He's angry about the turn of events. He flips down his night
vision goggles. They're activated by a lamp-like pull chain.
An infrared glow from the lens.

ANGLE - SEAN'S POV THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

Sees Goodhue reacting to the bullet, he's been hit. We can't
see the killer.

INT. GOODHUE HOME - NIGHT

Hibbing is shot again. Again and again. Shot some more. Bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang...he staggers. His glass is leaking
from multiple gunshot holes. At the bar he gets a box of
Johnson & Johnson band-aid strips. He is about to open them
when he is hit with very rapid single fire. He slumps against
the bar. More shots as if from an automatic weapon. He leans
on a chair. It's on wheels. He slides across the floor. More
shots. Turns and slides the other way. More shots. Slides
back again. Finally the bullets run out. We hear the firing
pin, “click, click". Boy is he relieved. He takes a cork from
a bottle and plugs up a bullet hole. A beat. Then he's hit by
a succession of arrows. He drops to his knee. After a beat, a
huge cartoon-like sledgehammer raps him on the head. He drops
to the floor.

INT. SYMPHONY HALL

Ryan plays brilliantly. The music is soft, sweet, romantic,
sad, so damn sad. We HEAR SOBBING from the audience and
orchestra. Ryan too is overtaken by emotion. His chin
quivers, tears start te rell down his cheek, they fail onto
the violin strings, causing the strings to vibrate with a
"plink, plink". It came at the perfect time in the music
selection.

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN BLUFF - MERCEDES ~- NIGHT

THUNDER rumbles. The car door is open, the RADIO ON to Ryan's
performance. As we PAN, we see we are at an isolated spot
overiooking the ocean. An opera gloved hand tosses a pistol
into the dark waters. Several beats and we hear "Plunk". A
moment passes as our person stands in reflection,
contemplating the questions, "Is life over?", "Has life
begun?" Unfortunately the splash of the gun is quite
formidable. It's traveled several hundred feet, and it douses
our person.

The applause still brings down the house. Ryan comes off
stage, he has a towel around his neck. Famous boxing corner
men, LOU DUVA and BURGES MEREDITH as his “Rocky” character,
carrying water and a stool, accompany him. He passes by a
scene from “The Godfather II", the white suited local mafia
don, FANUCCI, has the theater owner's daughter at knife
point, her father pleading for her life. Fanucci takes time
to congratulate Ryan, "Bravo". But Ryan has something on his
mind. He approaches HARRY, the old Stage Manager, who is
cleaning out his pipe.

In the process of satting down his mallet, Ryan rams it into
the crotch cf a member of the Arab Consulate. The ABAB
DIPLOMAT folds in pain and drops to his knees.

INT. GOODHUE LIVING ROOM - DAY

Ryan playing his violin. Hibbing accompanies on the piano. He
runs down the keys, and the keyboard is very long, really
long, will it ever end? As Ryan plays, he sees Lauren,
lovely, sensual. During a piano solo, Ryan emphases the music
by whipping his bow in the air, "Whoop, whoop". The whipping
movement makes Lauren tingly. She takes a cigar from an
ornate cigar box. Rolis it in her fingers. Then over her
thighs. Now starts to lick the tip suggestively. Ryan becomes
a bit aroused. He is standing behind an end table, the drawer
slowly starts to open. He watches carefully as she bites off
the tip of the cigar. Aw, Ryan can feel that in his happy
zone. The drawer quickly closes. She loves the effect she has
had on him, she smiles coyly, tobacco in her teeth.

  

ANGLE - RYAN
Finishes the audition to nice applause.
ANGLE - LAUREN

Cranks a wheel, which has rubber hands attached to it, |
wearing white gloves. They slap, more like a baseball card in
the spokes sound, against a stationary hand, ‘clap clap
clap”. :

LAUREN
I felt every finger movement.
Hibbing, what do you think?

She hands her husband the cigar. Hibbing seems uninterested.
He picks up his brandy snifter, fish swim in it, walks _te the
bar. His back now to us. Ryan's sense of it is he has failed.

 

LAUREN
Hibbing and I have only been
married for two months. I'm
afraid I can't read his moods.

No need to apologize.
(heartbroken)
I...I'1l be going. Thank you
for your time.

He opens his violin case, he takes out a London Fog coat,
hat, and rain boots. Puts his violin inside.

LAUREN
Ryan...

RYAN
Don't bother. I'll show myself
out. Good day.

He walks off. We HEAR a series of 0.C. CRASHING SOUNDS and
GLASS BREAKING.

ANGLE ~. HIBBING
Turns around. He‘s been steeped in thought.

HIBBING
Ryan, just a moment. When
you've been in the porta-potty
e game as long as I have, you
can always smell a winner.

He's mixed cocktails, with little umbrellas in them.

HIBBING (Cont'd)
It appears my wife was right,
we have ourselves a musical
protégé.
He hands drinks to Lauren and an overjoyed Ryan, who is
shaking a wastebasket from his foot, Lauren takes Ryan's
drink from him.

LAUREN
Ryan wants a real man’s drink.

Lauren removes flowers from a vase.

LAUREN (Cont‘d)
Congratulations.

She pours a bottle of vodka in the vase. Opens and sticks an
actual umbrella in the vase.

HIBBING
I think this deserves a kiss
don’t you?

Ryan puckers up. Quickly realizes the kiss is meant for Mrs.
Goodhue. He unpuckers. Hibbing takes one step toward her and
she wants nothing to do with him, she quickly hoids up 4 lot
of luggage. A plane ticket in her mouth.

LAUREN
Don't miss your flight.

EXT. GOODHUE HOME - DRIVEWAY - MINUTES LATER

Lauren and Ryan wave as Hibbing drives off. Lauren turns to
Ryan. She's hot for this guy.

RYAN
Will I be signing 2 contract?

LAUREN
A simple handshake will do.

He goes to shake her hand. She takes it, sensually licks
“ between his fingers.

RYAN
I spilled a root beer.

She cradles his hands.

LAUREN
So soft. Yet so powerful.
They could crush me like a
Marine in heat.

He removes his hands. She wants to kiss. He'd love to, but he
pulls back.

RYAN
Please, no. My head is
spinning like a dreidel ina
sandstorm. I should go. It's
hot out, and the leather seats
are burning up.

He gets in his convertible.
23

LAUREN
I'm wearing a thin skirt, let
me cool that seat off for you.

 

INT. RYAN'S CAR - DAY

Ryan takes off the "bear trap" device ala "The Club" from the
steering wheel. Lauren gets in next to him. Kisses nim. Her
tongue actually comes out his ear.

LAUREN
That's some kiss.

RYAN
I won a contest in the army.

He opens the car door. He can't go on.

RYAN
You're a married woman, and
I'm not.

LAUREN

You don't know what you're
missing. I used to lick
envelopes for a living. Those
long manila ones.

As Lauren slides out of the car, the envelope imagery sizzles
in Ryan's key erogenous zone, we see the car antenna slowly
rising.

ANGLE - LAUREN

Walking toward the house. Ryan's hand gently rests on. her
shoulder. She knew he couldn‘t let her go.

ANGLE - RYAN

He’s fifteen feet away, that's one long arm. She runs into
his arms. .

RYAN
This.is so wrong. But it feels
so right.

They kiss.
RYAN (Cont'd)
(a sensual whisper}

i'm not wearing any underwear.

LAUREN
(near orgasm)
Oh...

They kiss. Camera does a 360 around them, and around them...
che cameraman gets dizzy, staggers, leans over, places down a
bucket. As the camera is held from his face, and shooting his
and Ryan and Lauren's feet, we HEAR him VOMITING.

THE FLASHBACK ENDS:

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RYAN'S CAR - NIGHT

Ryan driving. He's on his car phone. As he drives, the cord
gets tangled in the steering wheel.

LAUREN (ANSWER MACHINE)
Lauren or Hibbing aren't in.
Please leave a message. BEEP.

RYAN
it's Ryan, I got your note.
I'm minutes away.

The phone cord is hopelessly caught on the wheel. He just
lets it hang.

INT. GOODHUE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

THUNDER. Sean is checking the murder scene. Lightning
illuminates Sean's black-gloved hand grabbing the map off the
bar. Lights from a car. He ducks out of sight.

EXT. GOODHUE HOME - NIGHT

Ryan drives up. Cell phone wrapped around end dangling from
the wheel. He exits the car, his coat draped over his
shoulders, very continental, and wearing a hat befitting a
true musical maestro and carrying his violin case. He notices
only one light on in the house. He doesn't notice a shadowy
figure hurry by the window as he heads around the back of the
house.

EXT. POOLSIDE DOOR - NIGHT
Ryan finds the door is ajar.

RYAN
Hellc?

No one in sight. He enters. The WINDCHIMES TINKLE im che

Sean stands in the shadows. He freezes when he hears:

ANGLE - RYAN

RYAN
Darling?

 

Sean jumps him from behind. For a moment Ryan feels good
his arms:

RYAN
Mm, it feels good. But we
can't live like this anymore.

He soon realizes it’s an intruder. A struggle ensues. The map
with "Hylander" falls from Sean's hand. Ryan sees it float
into the lit fireplace.

THE FIGHT:

During the fight Sean is in the shadows. In fact, no matter
where he goes or ends up, he’s in a shadow. Ryan finds that
quite amazing. So Ryan can't make out who it is. LIGHTNING
casts light into the room off and on during the struggle.
Ryan is swung around and slammed against the glass window,
from the EXTERIOR we see he looks like a human Garfield

~ suckered to the window, his face mushed up against the glass.
He's pulled off, but his lips, acting like suction cups.
stick, stretch, then snap. Ryan is spun against the wall,
nose to nose with a painting, then dragged to the floor. The
map has been stomped on, and all the scuffling causes it to
be kicked under the couch, and out of sight.

ANGLE - FLOOR - RYAN AND SEAN

Sean is on top of Ryan. Ryan grabs the guy's arm. In the _
struggle, Ryan is mortified as he ends up with an artificiai
right arm. Lots of wires, sparking, pulleys. Sean stands up
as does Ryan. Sean throws a left. Ryan blocks it. Sean throws
what would be a right. Ryan ducks the “missing arm" punch.
Sean’ snatches the arm back and runs. Ryan dives and tackles
him. An artificial leg comes off in his hands. And he sees he
is face-to-face with the deceased.

ANGLE ~ HIBBING

 

Ryan is startled. Jumps to his feer. Sean snatches his leg
back, Throws a cushion at Ryan who struggles with it mightily
as Sean hops away. Ryan n@lly throws off the cushion, gets
to his feer. Catches up with Sean.

ANGLE - SEAN

   

Has hastily put his leg and amm back o nowever...che arm is
where the leg should be and the leg is jammed into his
shoulder. It looks dumb. Ryan punches him in the face, an
eye, attached to a spring, falls from Sean's head. Ryan
thinks he has the upper hand until ne is hit on the head from
behind with a fireplace shovel, ‘twang! “ He falls to the
ground. He starts to stir when a coffee table is tipped over
on him. Sean starts to rearrange his parts. He speaks to a
person 0.C.

 

SEAN
{annoyed}

Where the hell where you?
(indicating to
Hibbing)

This is a mess.

He hoids up the map.

SEAN
He found out, I see. Just as
well, I would have had to kill
him anyway. As for this sorry
bastard...

Out cold. His image outline is visible ala Hans Solo‘s

INT. GOODHUE HOME - FRONT DOOR - NEXT MORNING

We HEAR a KEY TURNING in the door. (The following events
occur at a quick clip). The housekeeper, MARCIE, enters.
Before she can close the door, she is startled, she puts her
hand to her mouth in the classic ‘woman screaming" mode, and
lets out a bloodcurdling scream. The room is ransacked. Two
bodies on the floor, ‘the dead Goodhue, and the uncomscious
Ryan. She HEARS a bigger and more bloodcurdling SCREAM.

Ryan lays on the floor. He starts to come to. Goodhue's body
lays beside him. A vulture sits nearby.

SGT ORONC, a young hot-shot, with other police and a coroner,
are on the scene. They help Ryan to the couch.

RYAN

Ryan drops his head between his knees. Unfortunately -he rams
his head on the coffee table. He goes limp.

EXT. GOODHUE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER - DAY

Fifty microphones come out of nowhere, left, right, from
under frame, from the top of frame, of all types and sizes,
including a vintage 30's radio-type microphone, several boom
microphones, and one large turkey leg. All are thrust at him,
all hit him in the head, "thumb, bump, boop", he drops out of
sight. The cops help him to his feet and walk him through
this gauntlet. The one question shouted out time and time
again is, "Why did you murder Hibbing Goodhue?" Ryan iS __

The body bag containing Hibbing Goodhue is zipped up.
Revealing it‘s an Armani garment bag. Lauren falls apart,
consoled by Marcie.

Lauren bursts into tears.
ANGLE - POLICE CAR

RYAN
You have to believe me. I've
been wrongfully accused.

FERGUS
Guilt or innecence, it’s not

scum-sucking punks, like

crime. A jury of twelve really
stupid people who are easily
swayed by rich, fat cat, self
serving, asshole lawyers, whoa
will do anything but tell the
truth, will sit in judgment of
you...it‘'s as American as a
burrito.

Fergus does that hand on the prisoner’s head as he leads Ryan
into the backseat of the patrol car, only the door is shut.
Ryan raps his head, the door is opened in his face, he flops
inside the car. They drive off. The trunk has one of those
signs you see on the back of a “Just Married" car. But this
homemade sign states: "Just Murdered Someone". Tin cans and
old shoes hang from the bumper.

SOUND: GAVEL
Bleeds over:

He watches as the bus's "destination sign" is changed from
"Disneyland" to "A Hellish Prison”. A GUARD, a
necked, tough, nose tackle kind of guy, ‘however
reads: “Mrs. Austin"), pokes him with a trenchant to get on
the bus.

Ryan puts the correct fare in the meter. Goes to his seat.
The bus drives off.

JUDGE (V.0.)
You shall be executed buffet

We HEAR the SLAMMING of a GAVEL. The gavel impact startles
Ryan and ECHOES in his ears as he sits down. The bus pulis
out. In the b,g. an airline stewardess is handing out bags of
almonds. He can't believe this is happening.

Name tag says “Yorick", looks back at the altercation for
only a few seconds. As he turns his attention back to the
road, horror strikes him. A banana peel in the road.

is kept on by one of those slide bolt and chain door locks.
He's finally free of his chains. As he bends down to help the
victims, something out the window catches his eye, a LIGHT
off in the distance, he thinks nothing of it. He unties legs
that have been French-braided together. Then he remembers the
Light. He springs to his feer. The light has gotten closer
and he HEARS a TRAIN WHISTLE.

RYAN
(familiar, but what
is that sound?)
Woo woo?

EXT. PRISON BUS - NIGHT

It's right on the railroad tracks. The bright light of the
train is off in the distance. The TRAIN‘S WHISTLE sounds a
warning.

INT. PRISON BUS - RYAN

He stuffs victims out of the busted-out windows. He looks to
the outer side~view bus mirror. The train light is getting
closer. The sound louder, more ominous. On the mirror is
written: "Objects Are Closer Than They Appear. Move Your .
Ass!" Yipe! He has to move faster. All the time the sound of
the train is getting closer and closer. The light shines
brighter, illuminating the intericr of the bus. The last
victim is out the window.

Covers his head, awaiting the train. Doesn't hear anything.
All is quiet. Ryan peeks around the boulders. The train peeks
around some boulders nearby. They see each other. The train
WHISTLES out a warning. Takes off toward Ryan, "Cripe!" Ryan
runs. The train back in hot pursuit.

EXT. COUNTY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Ryan leaps onto the road. The train right behind him. At a
railroad crossing, he runs along the tracks.

As luck would have it, the train hops back onto the tracks
with loud SQUEALS and SQUEAKS, and sparks flying.

he's eating the apple and changing his clothes. Hopping out
of his pants. Hopping inte another pair. While pulling 4
shirt over his head, he loses sight of where he is and bangs
into a tree. We get a look at his stclen clothes, a woman's
plouse and a pair of jeans a few inches too small im the
waist. He quickly regains his senses. & dog comes at him,
snarling, barking. Ryan jumps over a fence. Good. A man's

EXT. "ROMAN'S" GAS STATION AND BAIT SHOP - MOMENTS LATES

A tired, sweaty, thirsty Ryan, jacket now on, approaches.
He's trying to pull himself together. He calls out to the
station owner, ROMAN, who is working on the engine of a car.

Puts the hose in his mouth.

Adding a can of oil to the car. We HEAR a RUSH OF AIR filling
what seems to be a huge balloon. Curious, Roman turns to see:

ANGLE - RYAN
Hose in his mouth, his cheeks puffed out to almost bursting.

ROMAN
(never saw this
before)
That's the air hose.

Ryan pulls the hose from his mouth. As he does, the air
escapes, with that deflating balloon sound, his lips
flapping, “Pppppppp". Roman sees this is a really strange
guy. .

A police squad car is driving down the street. Ryan enters
Roman's to duck out of sight.

INT. "ROMAN'S" ~ DAY

Bait, live and artificial, lots of fishing gear, poles, etc.
PRED is waiting to pay for a new lure. Ryan quickly looks
over the poles. Tests the play in them. He whips the pole
behind his head and brings it forward as if he's casting. The
line has caught onto poles, hip waders, lures, a sunglass
display; they go whipping over his head and into the far
wall.

Still fishing off Gray's Bay?

FRED
I did see a man get off a sub

place.

ROMAN
After how many beers?

Ryan finds this very interesting.

RYAN
The night of the murder?

FRED
Yeah.
Ryan realizes he's drawn attention to himself. Roman checks
Ryan out. Ryan spots his "Wanted" poster on the wall. A dead
ringer picture of himself, staring right at him. vipe!

RYAN
I'll take this rod. I'll write
a check. You have a pen?

Roman warily hands him one. As he gives Fred his change, Ryan
draws big, Buddy Holly glasses, a long ZZ Top beard, and
blacks out a few teeth on the "Wanted" poster. He finishes as
Fred exits.

Roman, drinking a cup of coffee, approaches.

ROMAN
T've never seen you in
Columbia Heights before,

Ryan looks past him to the corkhoard. We see a few of the
brand names he starts ticking off for his story.

INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL

Fergus is holding his head, gun in hand. He's wearing his
official police water-wings as he runs through the tunnel.
Splash, splash, splash.

CAMERA IS LOCKED OFF. We have Fergus and Ryan running up and
down the tunnel, back and forth criss-crossing, always just
missing each other. A’ lot of splashing in the water. At one
point, Ryan slides down a tunnel, laying on his back, his
arms folded, it's like a waterslide. He ends up at a wired
off end of the tunnel that is piled high with debris. He
tears off the fencing, freeing the jam up, a huge boulder
rolls at him. Ryan runs, the boulder on his heels. He grabs
onto a root and swings as the boulder passes under him and
rolls 0.C. to the SOUND cf HUGE BOWLING PINS being knocked
down.

Fergus hears this, runs.

hanging over the edge of the pipe. His toes rip through his

shoes and grip the pipe edge. To check the situation out, he
leans forward, at an impossible angle. He slowly straightens

up.

Ryan turns around.

Gains a bit of courage. Holds his nose. Leaps, but having
forgotten about the low height of the tunnel, he jumps up
instead of forward. He bangs his head into the tunnel
ceiling, he's unconscious on his feet, he wobbles, falls.
Fergus runs to the edge and sees:

They both panic.

Ryan has heard Cass say "No, he's alone." He closes the door
quietly. He has to know more about Cass. He searches her
dresser drawer. Under a lot of very racy underwear, he finds
a scrapbook. Looks through it.

Making his way to the elevators. The security guard watches
him very closely. Ryan places the stethoscope on odd parts of
the body as he orders:

Stops Ryan. Everyone is so busy in ER, they don't see:

SECURITY GUARD
I'd like te speak with you.

Yes. Just let me take off
this...

Ryan casts out the stethoscope, it hooks in the Security
Guard's ears, Ryan yanks him toward him, punches him in the

face. Grabs his gun, sticks it in the back of his waistband.
Drags him in the elevator. Doors close.

ANGLE - SECURITY GUARD 2
Saw the guard in the elevator. He comes at Ryan.

SECURITY GUARD 2
Hey you!

Ryan reaches for the gun in his waistband, but it falis inte
his pants. A fight starts. During it, the gun hangs in the
seat of Ryan's pants. It looks like he's carrying a major
accident in his underwear. He makes repeated dips into his
pants to retrieve it, but can't fish it out. He finally
unzips his pants and shoves his hands around inside his
shorts, trying to grab the thing. A very odd sight to
Security Guardg 2. The best Ryan can do is stick the barrel
out of his fly hole. Security Guard 2 finally nas the drop on
Ryan but:

ANGLE - CASS
Knocks him out with a bed pan, "Twangggg".

CASS
Quick.

They drag Security Guard 2 into an examining room.

INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE RECORDS ROOM

Ryan and Cass see a sign hanging on the door: “Back In Ten
Minutes“. He cries the door. Locked. An idea. He gestures for
Cass to give him a hairpin. She acts as the lookout as he
sticks the pin in the lock. Jiggles it around. The kmob and
docr plate crash to the floor. The damn thing is still
locked. Cass points out the duct work in the ceiling. Ryan
sees two workmen carrying a pane of glass to replace 4
viewing window in the nursery. They're using those hand
suction cups. An idea begins to stir in Ryan's brain.

ANGLE ~ RYAN

Sees they are distracted. Ryan dislodges the suction devices.
He walks off with them. On the way, he accidentally suckers
onte the wall. In pulling it off, he suctions onto a food
cart. A janitor throws open a door. As it swings open, to
block it from hitting him, Ryan holds up the suctions, and he
suckers onto the door. Pulls them off and suctions onto his
crotch, yank, yank, yanks. The janitor watches, it‘s very
strange looking. Ryan yanks some more, the janitor moves on.
Finaily the suctions are freed, "Pop!” Aw. Ryan enters: "To
Air Conditioning”.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM 2

DR SEE, white haired, half glasses, lab coat, enters with an
artificial leq.

DR SEE

Closes the door. We see it was all a show for the people in
the hall. See's demeanor changes. He's covert, all business.
And why?

ANGLE - SEAN
Sits on an examining table. Removes his leg.

SEAN
It's ready?

DR SEE
A work of art.

He hears a sound from the duct work, clip, clop, clip, clop.
On closer exam, we see the new leg is more in the shape of a
rifle. That's because it is a rifle. Take off the foot and
there's the barrel. Sean savors this new weapon.

SEAN
Yes, very good.

DR SEE
The price is now twenty
thousand .
66

SEAN
Twenty?

DR SEE
My costs. My risks.

Sean pulls a gun and silencer, "poof". See is hit. He puts on
the stethoscope, listens to his hearc. He dies.

INT. DUCT WORK

Ryan is using the suction cups to pull himself along the
smooth duct surfaces. He dislodges a whole section of duct
work. Pulls it off. Moves on. Up a slight grade. Down again.
This should be it. He looks through a vent grate. It's the
“Hospital Records Room". He removes the grate. Which reveals
a lot of phone and electrical wires running across the
ceiling.

INT. RECORDS ROOM

Ryan looks through the maze of wires to the computer below.
He notices the "STEINBERG" security system is on. A red laser
beam criss-crosses the floor in the shape of a Star of David.

INT. DUCT WORK

Ryan spreads the wires to have a better look. He loses his
balance, falls through the opening.

INT. RECORDS ROOM

Ryan is caught up in the wires, he dangles like a marionette,
bouncing and dancing about, a human Howdy Doody, coming
within inches of the laser beams. He stabilizes. He reaches
for the “Off Alarm" switch, he tilts, keys fall from his
pocket, he catches them before they reach the beam. Now, in
rapid succession, a lucky rabbit's foot, sunglasses, Tums,
Tic Tacs, lip balm, pepper spray, gum and a yo-yo, ail
caught. The yo-yo though does its yo-yo thing and heads for
the floor. Just as it was going to enter the beam, Ryan smaps
it back up with a flick of the wrist, walks the dog with it,
puts it away. With his foot he manages to hit the "off"
switch.

Not yet. He's doing us a

computer,

She smiles. Sean agrees. This is a good thing.
INT. RECORDS ROOM

Ryan extracts himself from the last wires. Sits at the
computer. The keyboard is the most complicated piece of
equipment ever. Triple the normal amount of keys. He timidily
turns the computer on. “Fwing", it comes on with a miid
chime. He carefully hits several buttons. A disk shoots out
of the machine, hitting him in the chest, "Ow". He tries
another sequence. It brings up the menu. He clicks through
it. He clicks into "Limb Replacement". It contains several
names. He types in “Addresses”. They pop onto the screen. He
types up “Phone Numbers". That appears on the screen. Great!
He decides to print it out. He brings the printer into play.
The screen asks questions, he clicks "Yes" every time.

C/U COMPUTER SCREEN

Screen: "Print?" Ryan hits "Yes". Screen: "From Pages?" Ryan
types in "23 to 24". Screen: "Thank you. How are you today,
good?" Ryan hits "Yes". Screen: "Getting any?" Ryan hits
"Yes". Screen: "Are you sure?" Ryan hits "No". Screen: “Have
you heard the one about the nun and the rabbi?" Ryan types
“Just Print!" Screen: "Okay...okay...asshole!" The printer
finally kicks in. After a beat it prints out pages. Ryan sees
an answering machine. He pops cut the tape. Puts in the one
he took from Cass’s condo.

RYAN (V.0O. ON TAPE)
It's Ryan, I got your note.
I’m minutes away.

Ryan is pleased. Evidence! Then before he can turn it off:

CASS (V.0. ON TAPE)

She hangs up. Ryan pops cut the rape. Grasps it
My God! She killed Hibbing! He does the classic
heartsick over Beroman and slamming his fist on the table”
from "Casablanca".

   

Ryan hasn't noticed but the printer has printed out pages and
pages. It shows no sign of wanting let up. Ryan snaps back
to reality, hits a series of keys, only accelerares che
printing. One steady long sheer of paper, billowing up. He
can't turn off the printer. The plug for the computer and
printer have the desk jammed up against it. He tries. He
can't get his hand down there. Meantime the paper is almost
waist deep. He looks at the computer screen, he accidentally
typed for the computer to print out 23232424 paces, not from
23 to 24. He must have ten thousand pages by now.

’ Ryan ducks under the dash. Bulls down wires from behind the
dash, it's a lot of wires. He touches two together, sparks
fly, but the car doesn't start. He tries again and again. In
the course of touching other wires, he plays hell with the
car's electrical system. We see the antenna go up and down,
the sunroof open and close, windows roll up and down, the CD
blasting out the voice of Mario Lanza, "Be my love...!* The
CD shoots out of the sound system. BAGPIPE MUSIC screams from
the radio.

plays it cool, then whirls around, socks the man in the face.
What looks like a man in a black hood is actually a seal. The
seal responds to the punch, flops over. Ryan sees Lauren on
the pocl deck, using an amber light to signal out to sea.
She's taking the tram down. to the shoreline. Ryan sees the

Ryan hears a male voice. And now a familiar one, Cass! But
he can't hear what they are saying. To get closer, he hides
behind huge "Foreign Correspondent in the Mill* big wooden

The gears slowly come to life. We see they work a boat lift,
which is lowering Sean's Zodiac into the water. Ryan notices
his coat is caught and is slowly pulling him into the
grinding teeth of the gears. He tries to pull it free, but
no, luckily the coat comes off his body, but now his tie is
caught. He yanks, no luck, and his pants leg is caught, damn!
He quickly undoes his tie, and now his shirt is torn from his

Sticks it on the sub deck. Takes out a timer. Sticks it in
the plastique. The plastique is really gooey, it acts like
taffy. It sticks to his hand, and the timer, it gets all
over. Trying to scrape it off with his feet, the explosive
now sticks to his shoe, plus his chin. He sees the timer is
counting down. Damn! He frantically attempts to shake it off,
no good. Plastique and timer are stuck to his hand. Trying to
scrape it off from hand to hand, it just gets worse. Down to

closing the hatch, scrapes it off. It's now in the interior

Coming toward us. Step, gun butt to ground, step, gun butt to
~ ground. We notice Ryan, in full kilted outfit, but his kilt
is longer than the cthers, below the knees, very hip hop,
very NBA, he's in the middle of the group. He slams the gun
butt on his own foot. It hurts. He reacts facially, “Mm!" The
teams make a smart turn to the left. Placing Ryan over a
grate. Air blows up his kilt. He has a heiluva time keeping
modest.

stabbing earlier.
