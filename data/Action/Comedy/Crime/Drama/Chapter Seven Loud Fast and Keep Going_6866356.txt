BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 1.

FADE IN:

EXT. PALM DESERT - MORNING (D12) 701

The sun is almost up. Smog clearing. A small PRIVATE PLANE
comes in for a landing.

EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER (D12) 702

As the plane touches down, we see A BLACK SUV, A THUG on a
MOTORCYCLE (we'll call him PONCH), and two other men
awaiting.

As the three men on the ground look on, the plane taxis to a
stop, kills its engine. Silence, then --

We hear SOMETHING - is that MUSIC? Ever so faint. It sounds
a little like Pantera’s “Cowboys from Hell.” The bodyguards
turn to see --

Across the airfield, in the distance - TAYLOR'S CAR.
Screaming towards them. And we can really start to hear it
now, the PANTERA.

We stay behind THE BODYGUARDS as they raise SCOPED ASSAULT
RIFLES; shoulder them. The car shrieks closer. The
bodyguards take AIM and FIRE off a volley of shots.

BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.

The CAR gets HIT! It flips over several times, lands on its
side in the dirt, a couple hundred yards away.

The bodyguards and Ponch look to each other, as, BEHIND
THEM --

A bodyguard emerges from the plane, holds the door open
for...CRISTOBAL SIFUENTES. He looks intimidating, but
there's something about his demeanor that's a little Zen.

CRISTOBAL
That was a rough one. I hate these
little planes. Guys! You're not gonna
believe this. The pilot is from the
same village as my grandfather in
Bolivia - fucking crazy right?

Then...he sees the cloud of dust billowing from the crashed
car.

CONTINUED: 702

CRISTOBAL (cont'd)
Whoa, what happened?
(to bodyguard)
I've only been here two minutes and
you already shot someone?

The bodyguard says something in Spanish.
CRISTOBAL (cont'd)
A bum rush?
(to Ponch)
Ver por ellos!

Ponch peels off toward the flipped car. And we are --

EXT. AIRFIELD, TAYLOR’S CAR — MOMENTS LATER (D12) 703

Ponch peers into Taylor's wrecked car. In the front seat;
two bodies, TAYLOR and VAUGHAN. Dead.

The back seat? Empty. Ponch produces a WALKIE, keys it.

PONCH
Dos Muertos --

He looks at Taylor and Vaughan in bloodied tactical gear.

PONCH (cont'd)
-- soldados.

INTERCUT:

EXT. AIRFIELD, NEAR THE PLANE - CONTINUOUS (D12) 704

With Cristobal. One of his goons holds a radio out for
Cristobal to listen to.

CRISTOBAL
Soldados?
(to bodyguard)
Gimme your phone.

EXT. AIRFIELD, TAYLOR'S CAR - SAME (D12) 705

Ponch circles the car, spots a BLOODY HANDPRINT on the car.
That's odd. FOOT TRACKS and fresh blood lead from the
backseat, heading AWAY from the flipped car down the runway,
away from the plane.
BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 3.

706 EXT. PAZAR HOUSE, CABANA — SAME (D12) 706

PAZAR is angrily setting out cups and saucers as NOHO HANK
emerges from the garage with a large box.

NOHO HANK
Okay, Goran, I think this is all of
Vacha's things. Maybe we donate these
tools to local veterinarian?

PAZAR
Throw them out. I told him not to go
after Barry and he fucking did it
anyway.

Noho Hank eyes the cups and saucers.

NOHO HANK
Oh. Are we having guests?

PAZAR
I'm putting this out for when the
fucking cops come to ask me

questions.

NOHO HANK
Should I go get a babka? Two babkas,
maybe?

His cell phone rings. Pazar looks at it.
PAZAR
(into phone)
Hello? Yes, this is he.

INTERCUT:

707 EXT. AIRFIELD - SAME (D12) 707
Cristobal holds his cell phone, warmly responds.

CRISTOBAL
Hey, Goran. This is Cristobal
Sifuentes, from Bolivia? How are you?

PAZAR
I am okay.
(covers phone)
It's Cristobal.

NOHO HANK
How is he still alive?

707

PAZAR
How are you, Cristobal?

CRISTOBAL

Complicated question. See, I flew in
because my guys said you took my
stash house, and just now two
military guys tried to kill me. I
hope this aggression is not just
about business, because if you wanted
in on the stash house, all you had to
do was call me. You know that, right?

NOHO HANK
Is he angry?

PAZAR
(covers phone)
I can't tell...

CRISTOBAL
You know, I've been a fan of yours
for a while. Like, when you sent me
that bullet via DHL, I was like, wow.
This guy is next level. Plus we have
the same job, you and I. And I know
how hard it is to break in in Los
Angeles. We should be working
together, not against each other. No?

NOHO HANK
(sotto)
What's happening?

the phone.

PAZAR
(bummed out)
He's a super nice guy.

NOHO HANK
(sotto)
That's great.

PAZAR
(covers phone)
We fucked up.
(into phone)
Cristobal, it seems I got bad
information. I was told to attack you
because you were bloodthirsty maniac.

(CONTINUED )
BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5.

707 CONTINUED: (2) 707
CRISTOBAL
Whoa, whoever told you that is just
wrong.
PAZAR

(covers phone)
We need to kill Fuches.

CRISTOBAL
I mean, you just assumed I was a mean
guy without meeting me? Do you know
the book The 'Four Agreements'? You
owe it to yourself. It's life-
changing. Agreement three in the book
is "Don't make assumptions."

PAZAR
(into phone)
Don't make assumptions?

NOHO HANK
Is that 'The Four Agreements'? Such a
great book.

PAZAR

(into phone)
Maybe we could take two steps
backwards, start over?

CRISTOBAL
Oh, I wish we could. But you killed a
bunch of my guys, so now I gotta kill
a bunch of your guys. You know how
this shit goes --

PAZAR
My family is already quite a bit
angry with me for some things that
have happened here. And you said men
I just sent are dead --

NOHO HANK
Barry is dead?

PAZAR
-- Same military guy you just killed,
he killed a few of my guys too, so
maybe we are now all even Kevin?

CRISTOBAL
If only, man. Agreement number one is
"Be impeccable with your word."

CRISTOBAL (cont'd)
I have to back my people here. So,
yeah man, it's a war now.

PAZAR

War? This is really not good news for
me.

CRISTOBAL
Well, next time you should just reach
out. Lesson learned. And if you
wishlist 'The Four Agreements' on
Amazon, I'll buy it for you. You
really never read it?

PAZAR
My wife gave me Mars/Venus book, but
I could not get through it.
CRISTOBAL
That's got some good stuff, but it's
a little psych one-oh-one for me.
Have you read 'The Alchemist'?
EXT. AIRFIELD, BRUSH - CONTINUOUS (D12) 708

Ponch crests a hill at the edge of the airfield, and down
into a hollow strewn with junk, wrecked cars, etc.

He rides slowly along, keeping an eye out.

REVEAL: Behind a junked car, Barry cowers, listening as
Ponch rides past. Barry is pretty worse for wear after the
SUV flipped. When SUDDENLY --

PONCH (0.C.)
Quien eres?

REVEAL: Ponch stands behind Barry, gun drawn.

PONCH
Quien eres? Por quien trabajas?

Barry stares at Ponch, then spots...OVER PONCH'S SHOULDER,
CHRIS emerges, holding the Bushmaster.

He has the drop on Ponch.

PONCH (cont'd)
Diga me! Quien eres?

him)
Chris...
PONCH

Chingate! Estas muerto.
Ponch reaches into his jacket, pulls out his radio.
BARRY
Chris. He calls his boys we're dead.
Chris, Chris...CHRIS!
Just as Ponch keys his radio, Chris shoots him.

Barry gets up quickly, knowing they need to go.

BARRY (cont'd)
C'mon.

Chris can't stop looking at Ponch's body.

BARRY (cont'd)
Dude. Let's go.

Chris drops the gun --
BARRY (cont'd)
No. Pick that up. We'll get rid of
it. C'mon!
Barry pulls him toward Ponch's nearby motorcycle --
Barry's phone buzzes. A text from Sally: "Where the F are
you? Rehearsal's starting!"

INT. RADISSON HOTEL, LOBBY - MINUTES LATER (D12) 709

Fuches is sitting in the lobby, nursing a coffee, nervously
waiting for Barry. He takes a Tums, checks his watch --

FUCHES
(to himself)
What is going on?
He dials his cell --

INT. PAZAR HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS (D12) 710

Noho Hank is preparing a plate of babka. He answers his

phone.

NOHO HANK
This is Noho Hank.

FUCHES
Hey, bud. Barry hasn't called you to
tell you how well the job went, has
he? Cuz usually he calls me. And I
haven't heard from him.

Noho Hank looks around...he shouldn't really be talking to

Fuches.

NOHO HANK
Did Barry do this job with someone
else? A military buddy, perhaps?

FUCHES (0.C.)
Maybe. Why?

NOHO HANK
Because if he did...Barry is dead.

FUCHES
What...?

It lands on Fuches hard.

NOHO HANK (0.C.)
Yeah, it really hasn't hit me yet.
Really broken up about it. Big kick
in the balls.

Fuches drops his cell down on the table, stunned. As he
tries to not publicly flip out.

INT. LAPD OFFICE - DAY (D12) 711

Moss, Loach and several other cops listen to a recording.

CRISTOBAL (V.0.)
Oh, I wish we could. But you killed a
bunch of my guys, so now I gotta kill
a bunch of your guys. You know how

Have you read 'The Alchemist'?

Loach stops the playback.

LOACH
There's about ten more minutes of
discussion of 'The Four Agreements'
and other self-help books, many of
which are terrific. There's no shame
in seeking help is my point. Anyway,
it's all in the transcript. The
upshot is we're looking for two DBs
at some sort of air strip, one or
both possible military. I guarantee
you one of them is our Bigfoot here.

Loach holds up a blow-up of the lipstick cam still.

CONTINUED: (2) 711

The cops get up, start to file out past Moss, who's looking
at Barry's photo on the board.

She takes it down, exits.

INT. THEATER, WORKSPACE — DAY (D12) 712

Barry enters from the backdoor, spots himself in the mirror.
Jesus, he looks like hell.

Sally passes by in the hallway, spots him, descends like a
heat-seeking missile.

SALLY
Barry, where have you been? Jesus,
you look like shit.

BARRY
Oh, I just --

SALLY
The cops came and found money hidden
in the theater, and they shot a guy.
They think Ryan was involved with the
mob.

BARRY
What?

SALLY
Also, we changed the scene, I'm
Macbeth and your line is different.
Sally turns to go.
BARRY
WHAT?!
INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER (D12) 713
Sally on stage, running the scene. She utterly sucks.
SALLY (AS MACBETH)
I have almost forgot the taste of
fears
The time has been my senses would

have cooled --

Wooden. Stiff. Self-conscious.

(CONTINUED )

BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 11.
CONTINUED: 713

IN THE WING: Barry arrives, watches her perform for a beat,
when --

BACKSTAGE: Natalie and Sasha walk through toward the
dressing area.

NATALIE
There's no way that was Ryan's money.
He borrowed money from me, like,
fifteen times.

SASHA
And if he had all that cash, why
didn't he take new headshots?

NATALIE
Exactly. Hello. His still have bangs.

ONSTAGE: Sally continues to struggle.

SALLY
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell
of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and
stir

As life were in ’t.
Then, she breaks character.

SALLY
Gene, I could really use some
direction here? Any thoughts?

COUSINEAU, slumped in his seat, looks like he slept in his
car, still reeling from his break-up with Moss.

COUSINEAU
I think...to use a technical term, it
sucks. Maybe we go back to Lady
MacBeth? Chalk all this up to an
overreach?

SALLY
No. I'm playing MacBeth.

COUSINEAU
You sure? Barry can scream his one
line in either scene.

IN THE WING: Barry's phone rings, he checks his phone, rolls
his eyes, answers.

(CONTINUED )
BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 12.

713 CONTINUED: (2) 713
BARRY
Chris, man, you gotta stop calling
me.
CHRIS (V.O.)

I need to talk to you, man.

BARRY
You need to chill the fuck out.

ONSTAGE: Sally resumes.
SALLY
I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous
thoughts! Cannot once start me.

She glances to the wing. This is Barry's entrance. Where the
fuck is he?

ANGLE: Barry's still on the phone.

BARRY
Chris, calm the fuck down, dude.

ONSTAGE: Sally repeats:

SALLY
-- Cannot once start me!

BARRY
(into phone)
Fuck. I'll call you back.

Finally Barry stumbles out, a complete mess.
BARRY (AS SEYTON)
(yells)
My Queen, My Lord, the Lord is dead.

SALLY
That's not...I can't. I just can't.

She heads off.
COUSINEAU

Let's take a tight five people. Tight
five.

BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 13.

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER (D12) 714

Barry slumps into a seat. Cousineau pipes up from his seat
nearby.

COUSINEAU
That was something. You charged out
there, equal parts loud and wrong.
Eyes like saucers. Blood in your
hair.

Barry feels his hair. It may actually be Ponch's blood.

Cousineau grabs a chair, flips it around and sits facing
Barry.

COUSINEAU (cont'd)
It's drugs, isn't it Barry? Look,
getting clean is an important part of
the actor's journey. Quick story to
illustrate: I was doing Long Day's
Journey Into Night at the Pasadena
Playhouse with a bunch of cokeheads.
It's normally a three hour show, but
we could bring it in in just under
thirty-seven minutes. We felt great,
but apparently it was completely
unintelligible. It was the beginning
of the bad years, Barry. I felt --

BARRY
I'm not on drugs, Mister Cousineau.

COUSINEAU
Oh. Well, that's not good news.
Because it's one line, Barry.

Cousineau puts his chair back where he found it.
COUSINEAU (cont'd)
And tonight, if you're not high, and
you still can't successfully deliver

one line? Well, I'm afraid this may
not be for you.

Cousineau saunters off leaving Barry alone in the theater.
Barry's phone buzzes again. Chris is calling.
INT. LAPD OFFICE, BULLPEN - DAY (D12) 715

Moss is on her computer. She's on FACEBOOK, searching for
"Barry Berkman" but there's no hits. That's odd.

BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 14.
CONTINUED: 715

Loach approaches.

LOACH
Hey. Lancaster's Sheriff's got a shot
up car near an air strip - two DBs -
both Marines.

MOSS
(cocky)
Let me guess.
(slams down Barry's
picture)
One of them is this guy?

LOACH
No. But if you'd been right, that
would've been cool.

INT. TAYLOR’S APARTMENT — DAY (D12) 716

Moss and Loach pass two uniform cops at the door and enter
the apartment, in the process of a search. Two forensics
guys, dressed much like the TID guys, wearing gloves. Two
other detectives in raid jackets. A lieutenant. And a
photographer are present as well.

Moss and Loach eye Taylor's Marine Photo.

LOACH
His name's Taylor Garrett. Six foot.
He's 415, a real hot head, and some
390s, drunk in public...broke a guy's
jaw in a bar once...

He gestures to a shrink-wrapped brick of money. It has a
familiar appearance.

LOACH (cont'd)
Same brick as at the theater. Same
exact amount. They split it. This guy
and Ryan were working together.

MOSS
Slow down. We need to connect them to
each other.

Moss spots something on a nearby shelf. A familiar face
staring back at her.

She crosses to it.

(CONTINUED )
BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 15.
716 CONTINUED: 716

MOSS (cont'd)
(to photographer)
You shoot this already?
The photographer nods. Moss pulls a glove out of her
notebook, pulls it on, reaches for a book. It's Cousineau's
book. His face on the cover smiles back at her.
Moss opens the cover page. Written inside, in cursive
crayon: Ryan Madison. Moss motions to the photographer, ‘get
a shot of this.'
Loach looks over her shoulder.
LOACH
I'd say that's a connection, wouldn't
you? Say it. Say it...
Finally --

MOSS
This is our guy. This is our Bigfoot.

She looks down at Cousineau's smiling face.

717 + INT. RADISSON HOTEL SUITE, LIVING AREA - DAY (D12) 717

Curtains drawn. Fuches sits in a chair next to a half bottle
of whiskey, his phone in his hand, talking in an emotional

voice.
FUCHES
He couldn't've been more than five
when I saw his dumb face the first
time. Sweetest kid you ever seen.
INTERCUT:
718 INT. NOHO HANK'S CAR, OUTSIDE PAZAR HOUSE - SAME (D12) 718

Hank's got his seat all the way back, whispering into his
phone.

NOHO HANK
You know how sometimes when you meet
a person you can tell exactly what
they looked like when they were a
kid? That's how I feel about my
Barry.

FUCHES
I know what you mean. It's a child's
eyes looking back at you. It's why he
needed me so much.

NOHO HANK
I went to the store this morning. And
I saw a man there and just for one
second I thought, "Barry?" But it
wasn't him. It was not Barry.

FUCHES
You know...he never got a chance to
apologize to me. And now...it's too
late.
(then)
So, where are we after all this? Are
we okay?

NOHO HANK

Well, to be honest, Goran is very
upset you told him to start war with
Bolivians, who are super nice guys.
So no matter where you go, we will
find you and kill you. But not before
we get ducks in a row with Bolivians,
so maybe a week or two? Is that okay?

Beat.

FUCHES
No.

INT. CHRIS' CAR - DUSK (D12) 719

A car parked in an isolated turnout deep in the canyons
north of the valley. It's quiet. An occasional car whizzes
by on the highway in the distance.

Chris is in the driver's seat. Barry, the passenger.

CHRIS
Dude, Taylor and Vaughan...they're
dead. Fuckin' dead.

BARRY
Relax.

CHRIS
We just left their bodies out there.
What...what do I do next time I see
Vaughan's girlfriend. What do I say?

BARRY
Say you don't know anything. We just
gotta lay low, man. And keep quiet
about all this.

CHRIS
I fuckin' killed a guy. I...I wasn't
in the shit, man, I was in logistics.
I never shot anyone.

BARRY
You had to do it.

CHRIS
I can't stop thinking about it. It
just plays in my head over and over.
I didn't even want to do it. You made
me do it.

BARRY
Chris. You need to relax, man. You
hear me? Relax. Don't say anything to
anyone, and this will all blow over.

Chris stews for a moment. He can't relax.

CHRIS
Listen: I think we need to go to the
cops.

BARRY
Chris.

CHRIS

We can say it was self-defense --
that they attacked us. Who are they
gonna believe? We're fucking
Marines -- they're criminals!

BARRY
Chris...what do you think we were
doing out there? What do you think I
do for a living?
(beat)

The guys who hired me to do that job
are already pissed I fucked it up.
They sent a dude after me. We need

to --

CHRIS
I can't live like this! We could go
to jail.

(CONTINUED )
719 CONTINUED:

Beat.

BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 18.

(2) 719

BARRY
The only way anyone is going to jail
is if you call the police. And these
guys I work for will come find your
family. Understand what I'm saying?
We're good. We're just gonna stay
quiet and safe.

CHRIS
What if I just turn myself in? I
wouldn't have to say anything about
you --

BARRY
We're linked, Chris.

CHRIS
Nothing about you --

BARRY
We're linked on Facebook. Your wife
met me. If you turn yourself in, the
cops are gonna find me.

CHRIS
No, they wouldn't, they wouldn't have
to --

BARRY

They would, they'd find out about me
and Fuches, and the acting class -
everyone would die.

Chris explodes.

CHRIS
I don't fucking care, Barry! I killed
a guy. You might be fine with this
shit, but I'm not. I got a wife and a
kid. The minute I got home, she knew
something was up. I lied and said I
was going to the gym just now. But,
I'm telling ya, she knows something
is up and it's gonna come out. So,
I'm going to the cops and I'm telling
the truth. If I have to serve some
time, fine, but I'm coming clean.

BARRY
Why did you just say that?

CHRIS
Can't believe you Facebooked me,
dude. You're a fucking hitman and you
Facebook me?!

BARRY
Why did you say that?

A beat. Barry stares at Chris.

BARRY (cont'd)
I_told you to get out of the fucking
car!

ON CHRIS. He feels something. A shift in the energy.

CHRIS
Y'know what? It's fine. I can keep it
quiet. I just needed to vent. But,
I'm good. I can keep quiet.

Barry says nothing.

CHRIS (cont'd)
And, I didn't tell my wife I was
going to the gym. I said I was coming
to see you.

Barry says nothing.
Just then, another car pulls off to the side of the road a
hundred yards away. A DUDE gets out, ties down the stuff on
the roof-rack extra tight. Barry and Chris watch.
Here’s Chris’ chance. Is he gonna flag the dude down?
CHRIS (cont'd)
I know you're not gonna do anything

crazy, Barry. I know you're a good
guy.

The dude gets back in his car, drives off.
CHRIS
I'm going to drop you off, and I'll
go home and keep my fat trap shut.
Chris starts the car. ON BARRY --
CHRIS (0.C.)

Chris has both hands on the wheel now. Barry claps a hand on
Chris's right hand and pins it to the wheel, pulls out his
Glock and as Chris flails with his free hand -- BANG --
Barry shoots Chris.

EXT. CHRIS' CAR - CONTINUOUS (D12) 720
Now Barry's voice, from inside the car, a terrible scream:

BARRY (0.C.)
Fuuuuuuuuuck.

We move in TIGHTER. Barry gets out of the running car. We
PUSH PAST BARRY to see inside the car:

Chris. His head slumped in death. The gun now clenched in
his own right hand. The car door closes.

Barry grabs a piece of brush, sweeps his tracks as he walks
away, down the dark road.

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (N12) 721

Full house. A BUZZ in the air. The theater is packed. The
performances are about to start. Cousineau can be seen
ushering VIP Guests to their taped off reserved seats.

INT. THEATER, DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (N12) 722

Chaos. The entire class is putting on costumes, applying
make-up, working elaborate hair styles. Antonio and Natalie
are doing vocal exercises, bent over a chair, repeating:

ANTONIO/NATALIE
Many men making much money. Many men
making much money. Many men making
much money --

Cousineau comes flying backstage.

COUSINEAU
Everyone! Bring it in. Jermaine,
Nick.

COUSINEAU
We're doing that now, are we?
Alright. Puck, take a knee.

The actors surround him.

COUSINEAU (cont'd)
Two minutes to curtain, all! It'sa
veritable Who's Who of Hollywood out
there. The red-headed-reader from
ICM, that no-one-knows-what-she-does
from 3 Arts. Daniel Meldman from
Gersh.

Sally perks up.

SALLY
He came?

COUSINEAU
I wish you Godspeed. I wish you
courage. And remember, whatever
happens, loud, fast, and just keep
going.

He heads off. Everyone goes back to getting ready. Except
Sally.

SALLY
Has anyone seen Barry?
INT. UBER — NIGHT (N12) 723
Barry in the backseat of an Uber. He looks like hell.

He looks out the window in a daze.

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (DAYDREAM) 724

A gauzy idealized version of a performance. SALLY is center
stage in a male Elizabethan costume delivering Macbeth to
the delight of the elegantly dressed crowd.

SALLY (AS MACBETH)
I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous
thoughts, Cannot once start me.

Now, Barry enters to a soupcon of applause, which he both
graciously accepts and modestly shrugs off. He is
reminiscent of Sir Laurence Olivier, full British accent.

BARRY (AS SEYTON)
The Queen, my Lord, is dead.

There’s an audible GASP from the audience. Barry humbly
exits. Sally brilliantly continues.

SALLY (AS MACBETH)
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such
a word.

She’s unreal. Barry beholds her from the wings, amazed and
in love. And then --

SALLY (AS MACBETH) (cont'd)
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to
day --

FLASH ON: Chris, flailing as Barry holds a gun to his head,
FIRES.

INT. UBER - A LITTLE LATER (N12) 725
Barry starts. The daydream having turned to a nightmare.

CUT TO:

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (N12) 726

We're with the audience as the lights are coming down.
Cousineau starts clapping, trying to ignite a pre-show round
of applause. It goes nowhere.

Lights up. Sasha enters and comes to center stage.

SASHA
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
Recently, our friend Ryan Madison was
taken from us too soon. Because of
this, all of the proceeds from
tonight's show will go toward the
fight against violence.

She walks off as a few confused people clap.

The curtain opens. Jermaine (in tights holding a skull)
dramatically takes stage, crosses to a mark, takes a breath,
then flubs his very first line.

JERMAINE
Alapse poor -- blub-alub. Uch. I'm
gonna come in again.

He walks off stage.

Cousineau looks around. This is worse than he thought it
would be.

INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE - SAME (N12) 727
Sally dashes up to Natalie and Antonio.

ANTONIO
I'm just saying we really need to
lean into the sexuality.

NATALIE
Oh, boy, I --

SALLY
Barry's not here, and I need someone
to do his stupid part. Is there any
way one of you guys could help me?

NATALIE
(fake Italian accent)
Sorry. We no can'a do that. We have'a
to keep our Italiano accents for
our'a scene from Two Gentlemen from
Verona.

ANTONIO
(normal accent)
She is exactly right. If we don't
keep speaking in these accents, we
will lose them.

SALLY
It's one line.

NATALIE
(fake Italian)
We have'a saying in'a Italy. You
make'a you bed.

She turns to Nick.

Nick? Never heard'eth of him.
Nick blows past her.
SALLY
Fuck...
INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - LATER (N12) 728

The show continues. Eric and Sasha do a Chicago gangster
version of Titus Andronicus.

Natalie and Antonio perform something vaguely resembling Two

Gentlemen from Verona. Antonio leans into the sexuality.
Natalie retreats.

The audience endures. Cousineau rides it out. Daniel Meldman
from Gersh gets a lot of texting done.
INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER (N12) 729
Barry enters in a daze. A frantic Sally spots him.
SALLY
You're here. And you're not in
costume. Well...fuck it. We're up!

Put this on. It's something.

She grabs a Hamilton-style jacket from a rack, thrusts it at
Barry, who starts to put it on over his street clothes.

SALLY (cont'd)
Come on! It's places. Now.

She pushes Barry into the wings.

INT. THEATER, WINGS - CONTINUOUS (N12) 730
Nick's on stage doing Puck. Sally and Barry in the wings.

BARRY

My Lord, the queen is dead. My Lord,

is dead --

SALLY
Barry, look at me. Here's what's
happening. You see that guy out there
on his phone?

ANGLE: A guy in the audience doing a bad job of pretending
not to be on his phone.

SALLY (cont'd)
That's Daniel Meldman from Gersh. He
was Emma Stone's agent until she got
too big for him and fired him. He's
here to see me. But if I don't do
well, it's over for me. He'll never
sign me. I'll never get him to work
for me. And I'll certainly never get
to fire him. So please, please,
please give me something to work
with. Can you do that?

Barry's in a fog.

BARRY
What?

SALLY
Fuck. Just...whatever.

The lights go down on stage. A smattering of applause. Sally
takes a deep breath.

Nick walks off past Sally.

NICK
Well, Puck just took a big dump out
there. That guy sucks...

Sally heads on stage leaving Barry alone in the wing.

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER (N12) 731

It's entirely dark. We hear, but can't really see, Sally
frantically take her place center stage. a buzz of lights as
they come up.

SALLY (AS MACBETH)
I have almost forgot the taste of
fears.
The time has been my senses would
have cooled --

ANGLE: COUSINEAU. Slumping down in his seat. She stinks.

INT. THEATER, WINGS - SAME (N12) 732

Barry, hands over his face, trying to concentrate, keep
himself together.

INTERCUT:

INT. BARRY'S DAYDREAM (QUICK FLASHES) 733

FLASH ON: A FAMILY PHOTO of Chris, his wife, SHARON, their
kid.

FLASH ON: SHARON'S KITCHEN - Sharon enters frame, answers a
phone.

BACK TO: Barry tries to shake it off.

FLASH: Sharon gets the bad news. Her features collapse. Her
heart races. She cries.

BACK TO: Barry once again tries to shake it off.

FLASH ON: Chris' son cries. Sharon tries to hug him, to
comfort him.

BACK TO: Barry hits himself, trying to make it stop.
FLASH ON: Mother and son cry over a casket.

BACK TO: Barry hits himself again, harder.

FLASH ON: Sharon answers the phone.

FLASH ON: Sharon drops the phone, slumps to the floor,
crying.

BACK TO: Barry hits his head on the wall.
And then WE HEAR:

SALLY (AS MACBETH) (0.C.)
-- cannot once start me.

Barry's cue. He turns, stumbles out --
INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS (N12) 734

Barry has entered. Sally, expecting the stiff, wooden idiot
she's been rehearsing with, turns to see:

(CONTINUED )
734

BARRY - 107 - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 27.
CONTINUED: 734

Barry, crying. Real tears of wrenching grief. Frustration.
Desperation. Through this squall, with monumental effort, he
bravely speaks:

BARRY (AS SEYTON)
My lord, the queen, is dead.

And then he just weeps. All the emotion spills out. The
self-loathing, the regret, the guilt, the shame. Barry sobs
as he stumbles blindly off the stage.

The crowd is stunned and confused. But Sally?

She thinks all his emotion was summoned FOR HER. She absorbs
it, revels in it - is utterly invigorated by it. His
catharsis is fuel to her own sputtered emotional flame. She
turns back to the audience with new confidence:

SALLY (AS MACBETH)
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such
a word.
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to
day --

ANGLE: PUSH IN ON THE AUDIENCE.

Daniel from Gersh actually starts looking up from his phone.
The red-headed reader from ICM, what's-her-face from 3 Arts,
they're all engaged.

SALLY (AS MACBETH) (0.C.)
To the last syllable of recorded
time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted
fools.

A small smile comes to Cousineau's lips.

COUSINEAU
(low)
Atta girl.

Back ON SALLY: as she AMPS UP for the big finish.

SALLY (AS MACBETH)
The way to dusty death. Out, out,
brief candle!
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor
player
That struts and frets his hour upon
the stage

SALLY (AS MACBETH) (cont'd)
And then is heard no more. It is a
tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and
fury,
Signifying nothing.

She's amazing. Cousineau leaps to his feet, clapping. The
crowd politely applauds with him.

If nothing else, she's gotten their attention. Daniel from
Gersh makes a face, "not bad."

The lights go down. Sally beams in the darkness. Then,
lights up, and the rest of the cast come out for the curtain
call.

Sally looks around, no Barry. She looks to the wings for
Barry, he's not there.
INT. THEATER, WORKSPACE — MOMENTS LATER (N12) 735

Barry paces like a caged animal, still manic, crying. He
tears off the Hamilton jacket.

When suddenly we hear: CLAP. CLAP. CLAP.
Barry looks up. Cousineau is at the door.

COUSINEAU
Bravo. You went to a place just now
that I have never seen you go. So,
bravo to you for --

Barry punches the framed photo of Cousineau and Judd Hirsch.

COUSINEAU (cont'd)
I see that you're still in that
place. I'll leave you to your
process. I have a couple of small
notes on the scene. But, that's for
later.

As Barry continues to reel, Cousineau backs out of the room.

INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE — LATER (N12) 736

actors, some of their friends and family, bouquets of
flowers, etc.

Barry emerges in a daze. As he heads toward the exit trying
not to be seen.

INT. THEATER, AUDITORIUM - SAME (N12) 737
The houselights are up. A smattering of people remain.

Barry comes out from backstage, heading for the aisle and
the exit.

Barry looks up to see Sally shaking Daniel from Gersh's
hand. As he heads out Sally turns and spots Barry.

SALLY
Hey, Barry!

She runs up.

SALLY (cont'd)
Look!

She holds up Daniel's business card.

SALLY (cont'd)
Daniel. From Gersh. He told me to
call him. He said there was a lot to
work with there.

BARRY
Oh. Cool.

SALLY
Barry. Thank you. For doing that for
me. That was...amazing. I didn't even
have to act. You just gave it to me.
Everything I needed. God, you were so
generous. That was acting, Barry.
You're a real actor.

BARRY
I am?

SALLY
Yes. Whatever you did to get to that
place today, that is your new
process. All you have to do is do
that, every time, okay? I'm going to
go change. We're all going out for
drinks! Thanks, Barry!

She gives him a kiss, runs backstage.
