EXT. SHIPPING DOCK/PIER 13 - DUSK

SUPER: LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA

A HEAVY CARGO FREIGHTER is moments from docking - and it's the
most beautiful scene ever as the sun's BRIGHT ORANGE RAYS beam
through the center of the ship, across the smooth water.

POV - BINOCULARS

Someone is watching the ship closely as these private eyes cover
one end of the vessel to the other. The BUSY CREW prepare their
eminent dock.

BACK TO SCENE

EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

The binoculars lower to reveal HARRY PHAN (50s), Chinese, three
thousand dollar suit and million dollar smile. Harry stands by

his custom Mercedes limousine.

Out of the limo's backseat steps EDDIE STONE (50s), gray, bald,
hard as a rock. He speed dials a number on his cell.

EDDIE
(into cell)
Move it in.

EXT. FRONT GATE/PIER 13 - DUSK
A small security cubicle sits next to a sliding chain-link gate
aligned with barb wire. A heavy set GUARD pokes his head out a

window as a PRIMO'S PIZZA DELIVERY VAN approaches.

GUARD
Can I get your name, please?

DRIVER
I got an order for twelve large
pepperonis.

The guard checks his clipboard. The driver plays it cool.
GUARD
I don't see you on the list.

DRIVER
Look, man. I don't know anything
about who ordered what or none of
that. I just deliver the pies.
I was told to be here at exactly
five forty five, on the dot.

The guard checks a wall clock which reads 5:45PM and spots the
cargo ship approaching the docks. He gives the driver a heads
up, opens the gate. The van enters.

INT. WAREHOUSE/HOLDING AREA — DUSK

Several DOCK WORKERS and WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES use forklifts to
load and unload heavy crates and pallets into various corners.

Enter the PIZZA VAN. It parks in one of the busier areas. The
driver steps out as he's instantly approached by an un-amused
WAREHOUSE MANAGER.

MANAGER
The hell you think you're doing?
This is a restricted area.

The driver is really TERREL “T-BONE” STIGGS (20s), thin, black,
the creepiest red eyes you've ever seen. He pulls a forty five
-- presses it against the man's head.

STIGGS
To the back of the van. Make a
sound and I blow your brains all
over your shoes.

Stiggs walks his hostage to the rear of the van.

STIGGS (CONT'D)
Open it.

The manager opens the rear two doors of the van. Several ARMED
MEN dressed as dock workers jump from the vehicle and charge the
room. All branding HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

The men split in pairs of two, covering every corner. They are
quick and concise - professional.
SERIES OF SHOTS

One by one

-- DOCK WORKERS are pulled from forklifts at gunpoint.

-- TWO ARMED GUNMEN pass a large window and see an OFFICE WORKER
behind his desk. They riddle the window with GUNFIRE as the
clerk dives for cover.

E./I. FRONT GATE/PIER 13 - DUSK

Stiggs slowly walks up on the rear door of the security cubicle
as he charges in, draws down on the guard.

STIGGS
Shut your eyes.

The guard squeezes them shut, like a scared child. Stiggs
strikes him over the head.

EXT. FRONT GATE/PIER 13 - DUSK
A large K-9 unit truck marked U.S. CUSTOMS SERVICE stops at the
security window. Stiggs, now dressed as a security guard, pokes
his head through the open hole.

The CUSTOMS AGENT greets him.

CUSTOMS AGENT
How're you doin' today?

STIGGS
Better than you.

Stiggs points an MP5 ASSUALT WEAPON in the driver's window and
unloads on the customs agent - blows pieces of him on the dash.
Stiggs cracks a toothy grin.

EXT. CARGO SHIP/PIER 13 - DUSK
A long STICK CRANE removes a steel shipping container from the
ship, slowly lowers it to the pier. Watching from the ground

is Harry Phan, Eddie Stone, and several of Harry's men.

Harry is ear to ear smiles as he slowly puffs away at a
cigarette.
Just as the ship container touches the docks, Eddie gives a
heads up to four of the men. All armed and toting heavy
backpacks.

The men hump it up the gangway and into the vessel.

INT. WAREHOUSE/HOLDING AREA — DUSK

A flat nosed TOWING RIG hauls in the steel shipping container
taken from the ship. It parks with the rear end facing Harry
and his gunmen.

INT. CARGO SHIP/ENGINE ROOM - DUSK

Harry's men strategically place their backpacks on the oil and
scum ridden floor. Fuel gauges, switches and meters cover the
room from ground to ceiling.

INT. WAREHOUSE/HOLDING AREA — DUSK

Harry, Eddie and the others watch as one of the gunmen unhooks
the locking mechanism from the rear of the container -- swings
open the doors.

Harry watches as two of his men use tire irons to pry open a
wooden crate. Dozens of boxes marked in Chinese writing are
stacked one on top of the other.

Harry opens one of the boxes and pulls out a cylinder shaped
can of dry cereal. He pops off the lid and pours the cereal
over the other cases. Small plastic baggies of CRYSTAL METH
drop from the can.

EXT. WAREHOUSE/RECEIVING DECK - DUSK

A large semi truck and trailer backs into the open dock.

INT. WAREHOUSE/RECEIVING DECK - DUSK

A forklift finishes loading the last of the wooden crates into
the back of the trailer.

Harry watches as his men hook and lock the back of the semi's
trailer. They are fast, precise.

EXT. CARGO SHIP/PIER 13 - DUSK

Eddie, standing by the limo, gives the go ahead.
EDDIE
(into walkie)
It's time.
INT. CARGO SHIP/ENGINE ROOM - DUSK

One of Harry's men responds to Eddie's call through a two-way
walkie.

HARRY'S MAN #1
Roger.

He throws up a hand signal to the other three men. In unison,
the other men reach into their bags and start a digital timer:
10:59, 10:58, 10:57...

All four men quickly retreat.

EXT. CARGO SHIP/PIER 13 - DUSK

Harry joins Eddie in the back of the limo as the Mercedes pulls
away, leaving the pizza delivery van on the dock.

INT. CARGO SHIP/MID DECK - DUSK
The hostages are lined up like ducks in a row. All with their
hands on their heads. Five gunmen draw down on them with

automatic weapons, watching them like hawks.

Stiggs unhooks an empty shipping container as the hostages are
forced inside, one at a time.

STIGGS
Let's go! Move it!

Stiggs shoves the last of the hostages inside and quickly locks
them up. Stiggs and the rest of Harry's team retreat.

EXT. CARGO SHIP/PIER 13 - NIGHT

Stiggs and his team load into the back of the pizza delivery van
as it speeds from the docks and out the front gate.

The CARGO SHIP ERUPTS IN A GIANT BLAZE OF FIRE.

The force of the explosion is so strong it shoots the flames two
hundred feet into the air.
EXT. HARRY PHAN'S ESTATE - DAY

A black Hummer twists its way up a steep and winding driveway.
The surrounding foliage is green and full of life. A beautiful
sight.

Harry's posh mansion hides behind some shrubbery.

The Hummer circles a giant water fountain. A culdesac leads
them to the front of the home. Out steps --

Eddie Stone and two more men. From the front seat steps DIEGO
RIVIERA (30s), Cuban-American, sharply dressed, trim beard.

From the back steps his partner HAL BENSON (40s), aged, world
weary, dark, tired eyes, sloppy.

And these men are two of LAPD's not-so-finest.

Benson and Diego stare at the grounds in a state of awe. They
are both reluctant to follow Stone's lead.

EXT. TERRACE/HARRY'S GAME ROOM - DAY

Harry, Benson and Diego hover over the balcony rail, stare down
at a hopping pool party with several twenty-somethings, young
men and women, swimming, sunbathing, drinking.

HARRY
They were street urchins when I
found them. Lost, angry souls.
No family, no job. Nothing to
live for. Disposed of by society.
You find someone like this. Feed
them. Cloth them. Give them
shelter. Provide them with means
beyond their wildest imagination.
Along with a steady supply of
whatever poison they're polluting
their bodies with...and they
become loyal as lapdogs.

Diego observes the crowd - unimpressed.
DIEGO

I don't know. They don't look
so dangerous to me.
Harry smiles.

HARRY
Come. I have something to show
you.

Harry leads the men back inside - as they pass a heated game of
pool between two hot bikinis, one of which is smoking meth from
a glass pipe.

EXT. HARRY'S SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

About a dozen of Harry's strays are firing pistols and automatic
weapons at paper targets. Young men and women.

Harry walks Diego and Benson down the line.

HARRY
As you can see, it's not all fun
and games. There's a small price
to pay for sitting in the lap of
luxury. I keep my soldiers sharp.
All highly trained, highly skilled
in whatever mission I see fit.

Benson peeks through some venetian blinds at a whole couch full
of YOUNG WOMEN in thousand dollar gowns, lined up in a row,
taking turns going down on one of Harry's goons. A special kind
of training.

Harry leads the two men onto an outside deck with a full bar and
a stone fire pit, leather chairs, swank couches.

He pours the men a shot of scotch.

HARRY (CONT'D)
I'm building an empire. Soldiers
loyal to me. Ready to carry out
my vision. To follow orders...
without question.

He hands Benson and Diego their drinks, as the partners share a
quick look.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Tell me where you can find that
kind of loyalty in your police
department.
HARRY (CONT'D)
That's where you gentlemen come in.
As I said, I've been spoiling them
far too much. The problem with
kids...you spoil them...they get
greedy. And they get sloppy. Go
into business for themselves. And
then they get caught. I can't have
my name mentioned every time one of
my people get busted slinging dime
bags to school kids.

BENSON
What do you want from us?

Harry grabs two manila files from the bar's surface, hands them
to Diego and Benson.

HARRY
I need certain people off the street.
Mister Stone tells me you're the men
for the job.

Diego peeks into a rear window and watches as one of the ladies
of the evening drops her evening gown to the carpet and
unbuttons her bra.

Harry steps closer to Diego, grabs his attention.

HARRY (CONT'D)
I've compiled some lists for you men.
The names on these lists have become
a serious problem for me. I need you
to dig up their records. Find any
means necessary to make the charges
stick.

Diego opens his file and takes a look.

DIEGO
You want us to frame up every name
on this list?

HARRY
You don't understand, Detective. I'm
not asking you to arrest them.
Diego checks with his partner, who is just as unsure.
EXT. STORE FRONT/VENICE BOULEVARD - DAY

A young thug in black tank-top, wild swim trunks and jailhouse
tats, wanders back and forth at a corner stop sign. This is
ANTHONY (22)

Anthony uses an ipod to pass the time. Just a few feet from
him, parked at a curb, is his black PORSCHE BOXSTER.

He greets another young SURFER TYPE and his GIRL with a quick
hand shake and a hug. A dope deal.

Anthony plays an air drum solo just as Harry's limousine creeps
up from behind. Anthony spots it, books it up the sidewalk.

Eddie Stone and Stiggs step from the backseat. They chase after
Anthony, who is caught by two more of Harry's soldiers.

SOLDIER #1 forces him to the ground and pulls CAR KEYS from his
pants pocket, throws them to Stone.

Stone and SOLDIER #2 head for Anthony's PORSCHE while Stiggs and
SOLDIER #1 escort Anthony to the limo, toss him in the back.

INT. HARRY'S LIMO - DAY

Stiggs and Harry's Soldier on each side of Anthony, watching him
like a hawk. Anthony scared for his life as he spots the barely
visible face of Harry Phan across from him.

Harry leans in closer, holds a cigar in one hand, a scotch in
the other.

HARRY
Hello, Anthony. How's business?

Anthony stalls, sweats guilt like a stuck pig.

ANTHONY
Great, Mister Phan. I've just been
out here, generating some business
for you. You know how it is.

HARRY
So... on top of stealing from me,
you're insulting my intelligence.
10

ANTHONY
(begs)
It's not like that. Harry, please.

Stiggs flips open a switchblade, rubs it up and down Anthony's
neck.

HARRY
We had a deal, Anthony. I gave you
everything. A roof, money, pleasures
well beyond your means. All I've
asked for in return is your loyalty.
When I trust you with my business, I
trust you with my life.

ANTHONY
Please, Harry. You can trust me. I
just lost my head for a minute. I'm
sorry.

HARRY
I'm afraid your word isn't good enough.
If I'm to trust you with my life...I'll
need reassurance.

Stiggs cracks an evil grin. Anthony notices.

HARRY (CONT'D)
I hear you and Lisa are quite the item
these days.

ANTHONY
Hey, man. Don't hurt her. Please.

HARRY
Your associate Mister Degrassi has
refused a sit down. On top of this,
you've been using my product to help
your goomba friends bankroll their
filth. You're involvement with this
man has all but painted a target on
my back for the police.
(dead serious)

I told you what would happen if you
crossed me. Didn't I?

Anthony's chest heaves, sweats like crazy, beyond scared.
11

HARRY (CONT'D)
You took what was most important to me.
The way I see it, Anthony, there's only
one way to make things right between us.

ANTHONY
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

INT. CASTING COUCH PRODUCTIONS - DAY

NICK DEGRASSI (30s), a real grease ball with slicked back hair
and a silk shirt with palm trees, leans in his swivel chair,
feet kicked up on his desk, balances a pencil on his nose.

In walks his busty secretary TIFFANY (20s)

TIFFANY
Excuse me, Nick. A Lisa Huber is here
for you.

Nick doesn't budge from his relaxed position.

NICK
Tell her I'm busy.

TIFFANY
She says she's a friend of Tony's.
That you're expecting her.

Nick quickly sits up, the pencil spills to the floor.

NICK
She's one of Tony's girls, huh?
Send her in.

Nick squirts some breath spray as Tiffany steps out and shuts
the door behind her.

In walks LISA HUBER (20s), thin, malnutrition-ed, pale, but all
dolled up for her audition. She's the girl next door type with
a pair of legs that go all the way up.

Nick sizes her up. He cracks a small grin.
NICK (CONT'D)

So. Tony tells me you're very
talented.
12
Lisa awkwardly crosses her arms, covering her exposed cleavage.

NICK (CONT'D)
So tell me something, Teresa. Just
how talented are you?

LISA
Actually, it's Lisa. And I'm not
real sure I know what you mean.

NICK
Yeah, I just bet you don't. But
I'm hip. You like to play the
clueless schoolgirl routine,
twirling your little hair, acting
all lost and helpless.

Nick bounces in his chair, nodding, biting his bottom lip with a
look of pure lust across his face.

NICK (CONT'D)
I bet you do that to all the boys,
don't you?

Lisa looks increasingly uncomfortable as Nick's creepy stare
burns a hole in her chest.

LISA
Isn't there a script or something?

Nick smiles as he pushes away from his desk, wheels his chair
into the open and unbuttons his fly.

NICK
Nah. Consider this more of an oral
interview.

Lisa's eyes twitch, lips quiver with hate. She clumsily pulls a
silenced TWENTY-TWO from her purse and FIRES THREE SHOTS into
Nick's chest.

I./E. NICK'S OFFICE - DAY
Lisa quickly exits, anxious, sweating. The outside waiting area

is wall to wall with nubile young women, all dressed to kill,
putting on makeup and doing their hair.
13
INT. STAIRWELL/CASTING COUCH PRODUCTIONS - DAY
Lisa storms into the staircase with her purse dangling from her
arm, breathing hard, running for her life. She almost runs over

TWO HOTTIES coming up the steps.

She pushes straight through them. They turn and stare, pissed
off, ready to scrap.

HOTTIE #1
Check the fucking yield sign!

EXT. CASTING COUCH PRODUCTIONS/OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Lisa runs into the street, cell phone in hand, still breathing
hard, staring in both directions.

LISA
Tony, where the hell are you?!

Lisa spots Tony's familiar PORSCHE BOXSTER creeping around a
corner as she smiles in relief.

And all of a sudden...

The Porsche SQUEALS ITS TIRES, barrels toward Lisa at a crazy
speed as her smile turns to sheer panic.

Pow!

The force of the collision sends Lisa tumbling over the roof of
the car, crashing onto the asphalt.

The Porsche speeds off.
EXT. LOA CHEN'S ASIAN FUSION - DAY

The Porsche Boxster rushes into the busy parking lot of this
posh, high class eatery, stops near a young VALET.

Out of the Porsche steps Eddie Stone and one of Harry's men,
back from their mission.

Stone hands the CAR KEYS to the VALET, who quickly parks the
Porsche in an empty spot near the front.
14
INT. LOA CHEN'S ASIAN FUSION - DAY

Anthony hovers over Harry as he sits in a private, reserved spot
near the kitchen, finishes his meal with a swig of Saki.

Stiggs and some of Harry's crew have joined him for lunch as
they sip beers and watch a sniveling Anthony beg, grovel for
forgiveness.

ANTHONY
So, that's it? We're square?

Harry wipes his mouth with a linen napkin.

HARRY
For now.

Anthony checks with Stiggs, who is ear to ear smiles. He's a
bit unsure as he slowly backs toward the door.

ANTHONY
Thank you. Like I said, I'll make
it up to you. Whatever you need,
I'm yours.

HARRY
Of course. Because without trust,
what do we have? Wouldn't you
agree?

ANTHONY
Of course.

Anthony finally turns, hurries for the front door.

Harry, Stiggs and the other men share a smile. They know a
little something Anthony doesn't.

EXT. LAO CHEN'S ASIAN FUSION - DAY

Anthony waits by the door as the VALET pulls his Porsche to the
front.

The Valet jumps out as an anxious Anthony crawls in and shuts
the door.
15
INT. PORSCHE BOXSTER - DAY

Anthony notices his glove box is open and a LOADED GUN rests
inside.

ANTHONY
What the hell...?

Anthony grabs the weapon, gives it a once over.
Before he knows what's going on --
BENSON and DIEGO draw down on him with TWELVE GAUGE SHOTGUNS.
BENSON
Police! Turn off the engine and step

out of the car!

ANTHONY
Oh, shit.

Diego covers the passenger side as Benson moves for the driver's
window.

DIEGO
Drop it!

Anthony panics and fires through the passenger window.
BAM! BAM!

The shots miss Diego by a mile as he and Benson unload round
after round from their SHOTGUNS.

Benson and Diego empty their weapons into the Porsche, BLOWING
SHARDS OF GLASS ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT.

They observe Anthony's body, and then each other. There's a look
of shame and regret on their faces as a THICK SMOKE still looms
in the air.

And then --

The METALLIC HUM of a familiar SONG begins to build in the b.g.
as the two cops observe their handy work.

CUT TO:
16
EXT. DEXTER AVENUE/HIGHLAND PARK, MI - NIGHT

“THE HEAT IS ON” bursts onto the screen along with a red 1967
PONTIAC GTO CONVERTIBLE.

Behind the wheel is none other than AXEL FOLEY (50s), black pimp
suit with white stripes, matching hat and dark shades.

Axel rests an arm on the side of his door as he cruises the run
down district of Highland Park.

TITLE CARD: “BEVERLY HILLS COPS”
ROLL CREDITS as we observe --—
-- A DRUNK on the street.

-- KIDS on a basketball court. One body checks the other and a
fight ensues.

-- A HOOKER at the point, making a date. She pulls out a tight

wedgie from her mini-skirt, pokes her head in a car window.

EXT. TITO BROWN'S POOL AND BAR - NIGHT

Axel's GTO pulls a quick u-turn, parks against a curb outside of
this dingy, sketchy looking joint. Out steps Axel in his slick

but flashy pimp get-up.

As he struts his way to the door George Jefferson style, a crew

of hooligans swarm around his ride, one with a basketball under

his arm, fresh off the court.

HOOLIGAN #1 uses a tape measure on his front left RIM.

INT. TITO BROWN'S POOL AND BAR - NIGHT

In walks Axel, as the unimpressed, dressed down crowd turn and
stare at the clown suit by the door. “Ohio Players” blasts on
the juke. A thick SMOKE lingers in the air.

Axel twirls a tooth pick in his mouth, observes the smoke filled
room of thugs, low-lives and hookers. The girls, gathered at the

bar, painted up, weaves and wigs, texting, chewing gum, bored.

Other locals shoot stick, play cards, swill beers.
17

Axel feels their contempt as he makes his way through the tables
and to a corner booth where he meets with --

RUDY VALENTINE (40s), wannabe thug, hooded jump suit, smoking a
philly blunt, a chubby heart attack waiting to happen.

Rudy nearly jumps from his seat as Axel approaches, clumsy, too
anxious. He shakes his hand, throws him a hug.

RUDY
Yo, Boogie Ray, what's up, brother?
Lookin' good.

Axel jerks away.

AXEL
First of all...don't touch the suit!
Second, never mind that shit! Third,
where the girls at?!

RUDY
Be cool, brother. They just runnin' a
little late, that's all. Have a seat
and relax.

AXEL
I ain't got time to relax. I'll relax
when I get home. Right now, I'm workin'.
I'm doin' business, and from where I'm
standin', you ain't ready for business,
and you're wastin' my fuckin' time. So
fuck you and good night.

Axel turns to leave. Rudy chases him down.

RUDY
I can get em here in five minutes. They
just a phone call away.

AXEL
Hey, man. I know bullshit when I smell
it, okay? You said ten o'clock and the
girls would be here. I see bitches at
the bar, bitches playin' pool, and you
in the corner like you sittin' in the
no pussy section. Time is money and you
costin' me money. I'm outta here.
18
Once again, Axel races for the door and Rudy grabs his arm.

RUDY
Look, I said they'll be here, okay,
now settle down and have a seat. I
got you a Hennessey and coke.

Axel stares down at Rudy's hand on his arm. Rudy backs off.

AXEL
Don't have me standin' around...like
an asshole! I got business to take
care of! You don't want my business,
I'll take my big ass bag of money
elsewhere!

The crowd all take notice, turn and stare at Axel and Rudy as
Rudy grows nervous.

RUDY
I won't man. Now sit down and shut
up for a second. Alright?

Axel heads to the booth. Rudy takes a seat across from him.

RUDY
I can get her here in five minutes.
Just cool out.

AXEL
What's this her, bullshit? I said
girls! As in two very specific girls!
A redhead and a mulatto! The word on
the street was you were the man to
talk to! You better not be goin' back
on our deal! Like you fuckin' with
Johnny the banana man here!

 

RUDY
Okay, it's like this. The redhead's
down. She's a pro, been workin' the
street for five years, ready for
business. But her friend, she's new
to the life. She's a little unsure,
but said if the money's right, she's
ready to talk.

Axel gives him an unsure look. A slight grin.
19

AXEL
Cut the bullshit. What do you want?

RUDY
So it's like this, brother. Money
talks and bullshit walks. You show
me the green and I'll make the call.
I can get em here in ten minutes.

AXEL
Ten minutes? What happened to five?

RUDY
Look, you wanna do business or not?

Axel pulls a brown envelope from his suit pocket, hands it under
the table to Rudy, who fans it out, gives it a look.

RUDY (CONT'D)
Sit tight. I'll be back.

Rudy jumps for the table, heads for the door as Axel makes for
the men's room.

INT. MEN'S ROOM/TITO BROWN'S - NIGHT

Axel locks himself in a stall, speed dials a number on his droid
as he nervously peeks through the cracks.

AXEL
(into phone)
Hey, it's me. Are you sitting down?
INT. KENAN MARCUS HOUSE - NIGHT
Axel's client KENAN MARCUS (50s), black, ex con, a strikingly
large, but tired looking man slowly takes a seat on his couch.

A very worried look shoots across his face.

KENAN
I am now. What is it?

AXEL (0.S.)
I found her.

Kenan shuts his eyes in peaceful relief.
20
KENAN
Don't mess with me, Axel. Not now.

Kenan grips an old family photo of him, his blonde wife and
gorgeous daughter LOLA MARCUS (14), big green eyes, perfect
smile, mulatto.

INT. MEN'S ROOM/TITO BROWN'S - NIGHT

Axel still in the bathroom stall as he peeks through the thin
cracks of the door.

AXEL
I'm not. My guy on the street says
she's cribbing with a girlfriend
at this guy Rudy Valentine's house.
Rudy just confirmed it about two
minutes ago. She's on her way.

KENAN (0O.S.)
She's meeting you there?

AXEL
Now, look. I don't want you coming
down here and scaring them off. You
can see her soon enough, but I'm
gonna need at least a couple hours.

KENAN (0O.S.)
She's in trouble, isn't she? Forget
it. I'm comin' down there.

AXEL

Look. Didn't I say you need to trust
me on this? Trust me. You comin down
here is a real bad idea. Sit tight and
you guys will be together soon enough.
Right now, I need a couple hours to get
this deal done. Alright?

INT. KENAN MARCUS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kenan, still staring at the photo, wanders back and forth on his
living room carpet, a tear in his eye.

KENAN
Yeah, alright. But nothing...I mean
nothing better happen to her, Foley.
21
INT. TITO BROWN'S POOL AND BAR - NIGHT
Axel comes back from his trip to the men's room and spots LOLA
MARCUS (21), all grown up, beautiful, and friend REENA O'BRIEN

(20s), redhead, big hair, covered in freckles and tatts.

The two friends remove their coats and take a seat at the same
table where Rudy and Axel were sitting. Rudy is nowhere to be
found.

Axel surveys the room. He checks the front door and spots Rudy
quickly making his way out just as --

TWO MASKED MEN

-- enter and pull two silenced UZIS from their trench coats and
aim straight for Axel.

Axel runs, leaps behind the bar, just as the Masked Men unload
round after round in his direction.

The bottles behind the bar EXPLODE as bullets rip them to shreds
and patrons dive for cover.

MASKED MAN #1 hurries over to LOLA and REENA, cowering in their
seats, hands over their heads.

The shooter removes his mask. It's none other than TERREL T BONE
STIGGS. Lola stares up at him just as Stiggs drops and reloads

a magazine.

MASKED MAN #2
Come on, man! Hurry up!

Lola and Reena make a run for the door.

Axel pops up from behind the bar and takes a few shots at Stiggs
as he tips over a table, uses it as cover.

Masked Man #2 returns Axel's fire as he cowers behind the bar.

Stiggs spots Lola and Reena making for the door. He cocks his
weapon, riddles them both with bullets.

The two girls fall to the floor. A bloody mess. Stiggs and his
partner retreat out the door. Axel's head pops up from behind
the bar, gets a closer look at Stiggs.
22
Axel leaps over the railing, runs to the two girls on the floor,
bleeding, dying. Lola's dead eyes stare back at him.

EXT. TITO BROWN'S POOL AND BAR - NIGHT

Axel leans against his GTO, holds a rag against his bloody head
as he watches the CORONER load Lola into a meat wagon.

UNIFORM COPS question several patrons looming around outside as
the lead investigator, DETECTIVE MORRIS (40s) curly hair, short
and pudgy, takes a statement from a HOOKER with orange hair and
a leopard dress.

He obnoxiously snaps at his gum as he approaches Axel.

MORRIS
You know, Foley, I thought we were all
done with you for good. Guess I should
know better by now.

AXEL
Yeah, I guess you should.

MORRIS
So who were those two girls? No, wait.
Let me guess. New business associates
of yours?

AXEL
My head's fine. Thanks for asking.

MORRIS
Oh, yeah? Well I got some news for you,
smartass. We got two workin' girls here.
And whoever hit em went after you first.
Judging by the way you're dressed, one
might get the wrong idea.

AXEL
The black girl's Lola Marcus. Her old
man just finished a ten year stint at
Jackson for armed robbery. After a few
hundred phone calls and letters to his
daughter go unanswered, he hired me to
find her.

Morris shakes his head with disgust.
23

MORRIS
This Lola finds out her old man is
getting out of the joint and goes
into hiding. Next thing you know
someone tries to burn all three of
you. Pretty wild coincidence don't
you think?

Axel gives him a dirty look and takes a stroll up the sidewalk.

AXEL
I know what you're thinking and you're
wrong.

MORRIS

Am I? He was an ex con, right?

AXEL
I know this guy. There's no way he
had anything to do with it. All he
wanted for the last ten years was a
chance to see his baby girl again.

Axel watches with sincere sadness and regret as the coroner's
van pulls away from the curb.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Now he gets to identify her at the
morgue.

MORRIS
Okay, smart guy, so who was it then?

Axel faces him.

AXEL

Rudy Valentine.
(beat)

A couple weeks back, Lola hooks up with
the redhead and the two of them move in
with redhead's sister at her boyfriend's
house. That's Rudy. I put the word out
I was lookin' for a couple of girls and
cut a deal with him.
Axel just

24
MORRIS
Is that it?

AXEL
What do you mean...'is that it'? What
else do you need? It's obvious whoever
wanted Lola dead knew I was lookin' for
her. They pay Rudy to turn the other
cheek and set all three of us up.

MORRIS
That's great, but it doesn't answer the
million dollar question. Why did they
want you?

AXEL
Who knows? I've been doin' some asking
around about Lola. Maybe they fingered
me as a cop.

MORRIS
Yeah? Well I got news for you, Foley.
You're not a cop anymore. So do us all
a favor and stay out of this one.

smiles and walks off. Morris follows behind.
MORRIS (CONT'D)
If you're thinking about goin' after

Valentine, you can forget it.

ALEX
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

MORRIS
Cos he's dead.

Axel stops in his tracks, faces Morris.

AXEL
What?

MORRIS
Cops just found him at a stoplight
with his engine running and his
throat slit. This Lola girl sounds
like she was running with a real
nice crowd, huh?
25

AXEL
Look, this girl's father is a friend
of mine. Whatever she was into, he
needs to hear it from me first.

Morris observes Axel's face. An unsure look.

MORRIS
Stay out of this case.

AXEL
Look, he trusted me to find out what
was goin on with his daughter and to
bring her home. I don't know if you
noticed, but she died on my watch.

Morris stalls. He finally cracks.

MORRIS
Okay, Foley. Fine. It's not like we
have much to go on.

Morris opens up a file on Lola Marcus.

MORRIS (CONT'D)

(reads)
Lola Marcus, twenty-one. Last known
address, 426 Lincoln Avenue, Detroit.
It looks like the last six months are
clean. September of last year, she's
busted on a possession charge in L.A.
It appears your girl spent some time
out there. Between April and September,
she racked up over four thousand bucks
in parking and traffic citations. Like
I said, after September she went off
the grid. We got nothing on her.

Morris shuts the file.

MORRIS (CONT'D)
There. Now you know as much as we do.

Axel nods and heads to his car.

MORRIS (CONT'D)
Hey, Foley! Stay outta this one!
26
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

The surrounding palm trees stand tall and proud as they ruffle
in the cool, midday breeze. OFFICERS and CITY WORKERS file in
and out of the building as a lone figure is seen racing up the
tall front steps. This is --

LT. WILLIAM “BILLY” ROSEWOOD, I.A.D. (55), tuxedo, unbuttoned
collar and loose bow tie. He's toting a heavy stack of files
as he rushes inside.

INT. INTERNAL AFFAIRS DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

A visibly annoyed Detective BENSON sits before a small Internal
Affairs review board committee, headed by ROSEWOOD and followed
by --

LT. WEINBERG (40s), a short, elfish man, with black wire-rimmed
glasses too large for his thin face, and --

SGT. VAUGHN (40s), an intense looking woman in a black business
suit and jet black hair pulled in a tight bun.

WEINBERG

According to your report, Detective,
you first noticed the suspect reach
for his weapon upon entering the
parking lot of Lao Chen's restaurant.

(beat)
But your partner maintains that your
suspect didn't make a move for his
gun until after you approached the
vehicle.

BENSON
Yeah, well, that's what I meant. As
we were pulling in, I saw what looked
like him popping the glove box, and
when my partner and I stepped out...
that's when he went for his piece.

Weinberg checks with Vaughn who nods with approval.
WEINBERG

Thank you, Detective. That'll be all
for now.
27

Weinberg offers an insincere smile as Rosewood looks ready to
jump out of his seat with impatience.

ROSEWOOD
That's not all.

WEINBERG
You have something else for Detective
Benson?

ROSEWOOD

I was just curious about something, Benson.

BENSON
Shoot.

Lt. Vaughn is put off by Benson's flippant attitude.

BENSON (CONT'D)
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

ROSEWOOD
Well, I was wondering whether it was
you or Riveira who decided on that
particular parking lot to detain your
suspect.

BENSON
What're you getting at?

ROSEWOOD
It's a simple question.

BENSON
Neither. We ran the tag and hit the
lights. The suspect pulled into the
lot and we followed.

ROSEWOOD
That's interesting. I guess you didn't
know that Anthony LaRussa worked at Lao
Chen's as a full time waiter?

BENSON
No, I guess I didn't. It's my first
time hearing of it. Is there a point
to any of this?
28
Weinberg looks increasingly annoyed by this line of questions.
He huffs under his breath.

WEINBERG
If there aren't any more questions for
the Detective, I think this would be a
good place to end.

ROSEWOOD
Just one more question.

Weinberg and Vaughn roll their eyes.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
Have you ever heard of Phan Enterprises?

This catches Benson's attention. He stays strangely quiet as he
avoids eye contact.

WEINBERG
Okay. I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for coming in, Detective.

Benson just smiles at Rosewood as he slowly stands.

BENSON
Yeah. No problem. Let's do it again
sometime.

Benson heads out. Rosewood shakes his head with contempt for
the officer as he watches him leave.

INT. INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION/HALLWAY - DAY

Rosewood and Weinberg walk side by side toward an elevator as
neither look very happy with one another.

WEINBERG
That was great, Rosewood. Very subtle.
Bill Rosewood, caped crusader of all
things corrupt. Vice cops running a
ring of homeless dealers and
prostitutes?

Weinberg chuckles.

WEINBERG (CONT'D)
I thought I heard it all before.
29

ROSEWOOD
The eyes never lie.

WEINBERG
What?

ROSEWOOD
His eyes. You see how he reacted
when I mentioned Phan's name?

WEINBERG
Probably because he didn't know what
the hell you were talking about. For
weeks you been after this Harry Phan
character, and for what? All you got
is the word of one cracked up hooker
lookin' to get over on a cop.

ROSEWOOD
A hooker who happened to disappear.

The two men enter an elevator. The doors shut behind them.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Rosewood, now super annoyed, stares straight ahead, ignoring his
pestering co-worker.

WEINBERG
So what now? You gonna take on the
whole force every time a bust goes
sideways and some delinquent
turns up dead?

ROSEWOOD
If I have to.

WEINBERG
Yeah, right.
(beat)
Do yourself a favor and give it up.
Give it up before you lose what
little credibility you have left.

The doors open, off steps Weinberg, leaving a pitiful looking
Rosewood to ponder it all.
30
INT. CHURCH/WEDDING CHAPEL - DAY

A big crowd is making their way in as a couple of GROOMSMEN in
tuxes stand at the doors and greet friends and family. A large
picture frame rests on an easel.

The names JOHN TAGGERT and JORDAN TAYLOR are featured elegantly
behind the glass.

INT. CHOIR ROOM - DAY

The groom stands before a sliding mirror door, fixes his tie and
runs a couple fingers through his hair.

This is JOHN TAGGERT, JR. (20s), shaggy, strawberry blonde hair,
handsome, and strikes a similar resemblance to his old man, if
not for a neatly trimmed goatee.

TAGGERT (0O.S.)
If only your mother could see you.

This voice belongs to none other than JOHN TAGGERT, SR. (60s),
aged, tired eyes, and a bit grayer than we've seen before.

JOHNNY
You're not gonna make me start crying,
are you, pop? That's the bride's job.

TAGGERT
You know that was her one regret. Not
being able to see this day. And to
think...I almost missed it.

Johnny isn't happy with his tie, starts over, a bit nervous to
say the least.

JOHNNY
Well, you're here now. Nothing else
matters.

TAGGERT

It does matter. I was supposed to be
the strong one. The one that held us
all together.

Taggert intervenes, helps tie Johnny's knot.
31
TAGGERT (CONT'D)
I guess after your Mom passed...I
wasn't sure how to handle things.
It had been so long since I had to
be a father. It made me realize
something.

JOHNNY
What's that?

TAGGERT
I wasn't such a great father to you
growing up. I let your mother handle
things at home while I was running
around the streets like a kid.

Taggert shakes his head with regret, misty eyed.

TAGGERT (CONT'D)
I know you still resent me for that.
And I'm sorry. But I just want you to
know that I'm back. And I'm not going
anywhere. If it's okay with you...I
wanna start over.

Taggert finishes the knot. Johnny smiles.

JOHNNY
Sure, pop.

Johnny gives his old man a long, overdue hug. In walks Rosewood
with a concerned look on his face. Taggert and Johnny both turn
quickly wiping their tears.

ROSEWOOD
Hey. We got less than ten minutes and
we're still missing a best man.

TAGGERT
Well go find him, Billy.

ROSEWOOD
I know where he is. In the bathroom. I
think he's sick or something. He went
in there ten minutes ago and won't come
out.

This scares Johnny as he races for the door.
32
INT. CHURCH MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Behind a bathroom stall, smoking crystal meth from a glass pipe,
is RICKY JARVIS (20s), sweaty, anxious, a real mess. His face,
forehead and unbuttoned shirt are soaked.

Ricky takes another monster hit and COUGHS out loud. He leans
his head against the stall door, squeezes his eyes shut.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

In runs a worried Johnny as he pushes in each of the stall doors
in search of Ricky.

He finds him - pulls him from the stall by his shirt collar and
throws him against the door.

JOHNNY
What the hell are you doing? You
can't stop for a few hours?

Johnny feels a strange bulge behind Ricky's tux jacket and yanks
out a thirty eight special.

JOHNNY (CONT'D)
You're packing? What's the matter
with you? Bringing a gun to my
wedding?

RICKY
They know, man! They know! That
broad at The Pit Stop! The one
I told you about! She knew it
was me!

JOHNNY
You're being paranoid. It's all
that shit you're smokin’.

RICKY
Nah, man! It's that guy! It's that
fuckin' guy with the eyes! He's been
following me! I seen him all week!
They know! They know, man!

Johnny clasps his hand over Ricky's mouth, keeps him quiet as he
keeps a close eye on the door.
33

JOHNNY
You're gonna pull yourself together
and get through the next couple of
hours without embarrassing me. You
got it?

Johnny lets go of his mouth, opens the chamber on the thirty
eight and empties the shells.

Johnny observes what a mess his buddy is. His tie loose, shirt
undone and soaked with sweat.

JOHNNY (CONT'D)
Clean yourself up, man. Everyone's
waiting.

INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

Johnny and his bride to be stand side by side before a MINISTER,
while Ricky, Rosewood and the other GROOMSMEN watch on.

Taggert sits in the first row and exchanges a cordial smile with
JORDAN'S MOTHER AND FATHER across the aisle.

MINISTER
Dearly Beloved: We are gathered here,
in the presence of God and of this
company, that John Taggert and Jordan
Taylor may be united in holy matrimony.
We are here to celebrate and share in
the glorious act that God is about to
perform - the act by which He converts
their love for one another into the
holy and sacred estate of marriage...

And through the rear two doors struts AXEL in a leather jacket,
jeans and sloppy sweatshirt.

Rosewood catches a glimpse of Axel out of the corner of his eye
and does a double-take.

ROSEWOOD
Fuck me!

MINISTER
You disagree?
34
The entire congregation, including Taggert, turn and stare back
at Axel looming at the double doors.

Taggert shuts his tired eyes and rubs the bridge of his nose as
he slumps in defeat.

Axel just smiles back at the curious crowd.

AXEL
How ya doin'?! Carry on!

Axel laughs.

INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - DAY

Jordan's arm around husband Johnny as she swipes a handful of
wedding cake frosting and smears his face. The crowd erupts

with laughter. Taggert, Axel and Rosewood sip some punch in
the corner.

TAGGERT
You still know how to make an entrance,
Foley.

AXEL

Yeah, well, sorry I was late, but my
invitation must've got lost in the
mail.

TAGGERT
Hey. Even I didn't know about this
wedding until a week ago.

AXEL
How's that?

TAGGERT
I guess you could say I've been MIA
for awhile. It's a long story.

ROSEWOOD
(to Axel)
Speaking of...where the hell have you
been? I tried to call you at least a
dozen times the last couple years. No
one down at the station even knew
who you were.
35

AXEL
I've been MIA for awhile.

Taggert and Rosewood share a not so surprised smile.

AXEL (CONT'D)
It's a long story.

Axel's trademark laugh.

TAGGERT
So what're you doing out here?

AXEL
Actually, I'm working a case.

ROSEWOOD
Why am I not surprised? The answer's
no, Axel.

AXEL

You ain't even heard what I gotta say.

ROSEWOOD
That's right. And I wanna keep it
that way while I can still hold on
to my job.

Axel rests his hand on Rosewood's forehead, playfully checks his
temperature.

AXEL
Who are you? What have you done with
Rosewood?

TAGGERT
Billy's IAD now, Axel.

Axel is taken aback. He hides a grin.

ROSEWOOD
That's right. It means I can't start
World War III in the street every
time you're in town. I'm happy to see
you and all, but do me the favor of
keeping me out of it.
36
Rosewood walks off. Axel is confused while Taggert shakes his
head.

AXEL
Is he serious?

TAGGERT
I'm afraid so.

The banging of a knife on a champagne flute grabs everyone's
attention. Axel and Taggert watch as Ricky grabs a mic and
steps to the center of the floor.

RICKY

It's about that time. Time for me to
say something nice about the bride and
groom. As both John and Jordan already
know...I've never been very good in
front of crowds. But because of them...
and their love and support...I'm alive
today and blessed to still have the
opportunity talk to big crowds like you.
To share my story to people who are
struggling every day with drug and
alcohol abuse.

(to John and Jordan)
People in dying need of that same love
and support you've given me. I feel
grateful to be alive today to pay
those same blessings forward.

Ricky is obviously high as John and Jordan can barely watch his
toast. They sport a fake smile for the crowd.

AXEL
(whispers)
What was he doin' in that bathroom
anyways?

An embarrassed Taggert shooshes him.

RICKY
I don't wanna take up too much time
away from you guys. After all, this
is your show. But I just wanna say
one more thing.

Ricky is distracted by STIGGS standing at the front door.
37
Axel follows his look to the door, but Stiggs is now gone. The
crowd observes Ricky's unusual behavior.

RICKY (CONT'D)
I just wanna say that...

Ricky checks the other side of the room for Stiggs. His face
moves through a crowd gathered near the punch table.

Axel and Taggert follow his look toward the punch table as Axel
recognizes the evil, familiar face of Stiggs smiling at Ricky.

AXEL
Oh, shit.

Taggert squints in confusion.

TAGGERT
What?

RICKY
(to crowd)

Excuse me.

Ricky drops the mic to the floor and books it for the front door
as the crowd erupts with chatter.

Johnny quickly stands - surveys the room for Stiggs.

Axel watches on as Stiggs races out the opposite door in pursuit
of Ricky.

AXEL
(to Taggert)
Excuse me.

Axel takes off after him.

TAGGERT
What the hell's going on?

CUT TO:
EXT. CHURCH/WEDDING CHAPEL - DAY
Ricky bursts through the front doors of this massive church as

he charges down the steps with a purpose. He stops dead in his
tracks as he spots --
38
A green BOSS 302 screaming around the corner with a MACHINE GUN
dangling from the passenger window.

Ricky leaps behind some bushes to avoid being shot by the gunman
just as Axel runs out a side door.

The BOSS 302 brakes in front of the church steps.

The GUNMAN open fires in Ricky's direction as a bullet passes
through the shrubs and strikes him in the left arm.

Both Johnny and Jordan run out the front door as Jordan almost
trips on her dress. A stray bullet tears through her sleeve as
Johnny tackles her to the ground.

Axel charges down a glassy slope and stops on a sidewalk just
behind the car's rear windshield. He takes aim:

POW-POW-POW!

The three shots SHATTER THE REAR WINDSHIELD as the flashy car
speeds off.

Axel runs up the church steps just as Stiggs hovers over Ricky,
still hiding behind the shrubbery.

Stiggs smiles and takes aim. Ricky squeezes his eyes shut and
curls up like a baby.

Axel takes aim.

AXEL
Hey!

Stiggs aims and fires just as Axel dives for cover behind the
cement wall. Stiggs turns back to Ricky - but he's long gone.

Axel peeks around the corner of the wall - notices both Stiggs
and Ricky are gone.

CHURCH STEPS - LATER
The FLASHING RED AND BLUE LIGHTS of SQUAD CARS are parked at the
base of the steps as Rosewood gives his statement to an on-scene

DETECTIVE.

Axel and Taggert rest on the top step as they watch the hopping
mad bride pace back and forth, give Johnny crap.
39

JORDAN
What did I say about him being in
the wedding?!

Johnny rolls his eyes and rubs his sore temples.

JORDAN (CONT'D)
It's because of this shit! Once a
junky always a junky! He's supposed
to be your friend and he can't give
you just one day?!

JOHNNY
Look, there's more to it than that,
okay? You don't know the whole
story.

Taggert quickly turns, faces his son.

JORDAN

There's always a story with Ricky!
I don't wanna hear it! Not today!

(beat)
This wasn't supposed to be like this!
We're supposed to look back on today
as the greatest day of our life! Now
every time we look at our wedding
pictures, they'll say 'hey...that's a
real beautiful dress! Besides that
huge fucking bullet hole ripped in
the sleeve!

JOHNNY
This wasn't his fault!

Taggert quickly stands - interrupts their shouting match.

TAGGERT
What're you talking about?

Johnny hugs his hips and turns his back on his dad.

TAGGERT (CONT'D)
You know something about this? If
you know something, you better tell
me.
40
JOHNNY
It's complicated. It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

JORDAN
What wasn't supposed to go down like
this?
Axel joins them.
AXEL

If you know who those guys are, you
need to say so.

JOHNNY
I don't know who they are. I just
heard stories. Ricky won't tell me.
He's scared to death of him.

TAGGERT
Him? Who's him?

Rosewood joins the conversation.

JOHNNY

Before Ricky got clean, he used to
sling dope for this guy. He found
him trying to boost his car, and
instead of turning him in to the
cops, he offers him a briefcase
full of cash to go work for him.

(beat)
At least that's the story he gave
me.

ROSEWOOD
What's his name?

Johnny gives Rosewood a dirty look.

JOHNNY
I told you, I don't know!

TAGGERT
More importantly...what's this got
to do with you?

Johnny remains strangely quiet as he paces back and forth.
41
TAGGERT (CONT'D)
Well...?

JORDAN
Answer him!

JOHNNY
The Super Bowl, Dad. It cleaned me
out. Jordan and my nest egg. Our
down payment on the house, our honey
moon. Everything. Gone.

Jordan's jaw drops. Taggert gives his son a look of true and
utter disappointment.

JORDAN
Come again?! You're kidding, right?

TAGGERT
I thought you were done with that.

JORDAN
Yeah, so did I!

JOHNNY
Ricky came up with this idea to get
it all back. I told him I wasn't
interested, but you know when Ricky
gets an idea in his head, you can't
stop him --

TAGGERT
(interrupts)
It's too late for all that now. The
damage is done.

JOHNNY
He said he was gonna hit this place
they call 'The Pit Stop'.

ROSEWOOD
That gas station on Mulholland?

JOHNNY
Right. This guy he worked for. He
uses it as a front to run drugs and
whores. Takes in anywhere from ten
to twenty grand a night. In cash.
42
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
It's the kind of money nobody reports
stolen.

TAGGERT
(angry)
Yeah, well, somebody noticed it was
missing, didn't they?

Johnny hangs his head in shame. Axel and Rosewood watch Taggert

burn with
EXT. LAX

A stretch
parked at

anger and disappointment.
- FLIGHT DEPARTURES - DAY

limo with “Just Married” painted on the rear window is
the curb while --

Taggert bids farewell to Johnny and his new bride, luggage and
other personals by their side.

JOHNNY
Look, Dad. I don't know when I can
pay you back.

TAGGERT
It's okay. I never really got you a
real wedding present. And remember
what I said. Don't come back until
I tell you it's safe.

JOHNNY
What're you gonna do?

TAGGERT
We're gonna find Ricky and the rest
of that money and straighten this
thing out. But I don't want you two
to worry about it. I know too many
cops in this town. I'm not gonna let
anything happen to any of you.

Johnny cracks a half-hearted smile.

JOHNNY
Thanks, pop.

TAGGERT
Now give me a hug.
43
Johnny throws an arm around Taggert while Jordan watches and
smiles.

INT. STRETCH LIMO - DAY

Rosewood and Axel watch Taggert and son from the backseat of the
limo. The two sit across from one another. Rosewood having a
nice scotch while Axel sips a can of soda.

ROSEWOOD
You know, I've heard of Moms crying
at weddings but never cos the bride
got shot in the arm.

AXEL
Look at the bright side. They could
have killed her and not the dress.
One day they're gonna look back on
this and laugh their asses off.
Trust me.

Rosewood isn't convinced.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Well, maybe not, but check this out.

Axel reaches in his coat, grabs a wrinkled photograph of LOLA
MARCUS and hands it to Rosewood.

ROSEWOOD
Who's this?

AXEL
Lola Marcus.

ROSEWOOD
And who's Lola Marcus?

AXEL
Her father hired me to track her down
after she disappeared a few months
back. She was staying in LA for the
better part of last year until she got
busted on a drug possession.

ROSEWOOD
I never saw her.
44
AXEL
She came back to Detroit and somebody
killed her.

ROSEWOOD
You got any leads?

AXEL
Not until today. The guy that popped
her just so happens to be the same
asshole that shot up a wedding this
afternoon.

ROSEWOOD
You saw this guy?

AXEL
I was there. He took her out, along
with her girlfriend. Tried to take me
out along with them. I don't know
about Lola, but I'm pretty sure her
friend was a pro.

Rosewood thinks it all over.

ROSEWOOD
Johnny mentioned this guy was running
prostitutes.

AXEL
Bingo. The only problem is, other than
a possession charge, I got nothin' on
her. Ever since her bust last year, her
record's clean.

Rosewood's eyes dance, in deep thought.

ROSEWOOD
Just like she was protected.

Axel squints. He's not following.
ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
I got a feeling I know who Ricky was

working for.

Axel smiles. In steps Taggert who pops a long cubano in his
mouth and lights up.
45
ROSEWOOD
(to Taggert)
How'd it go?

TAGGERT
Okay. So now what?

The LIMO DRIVER reaches over his seat, stares back at the three
friends in the back.

LIMO DRIVER
Where to, gentlemen?

Taggert, Axel and Rosewood share a silly grin. The AXEL F theme
begins in the b.g.

Axel laughs.

ROSEWOOD
Shhhhit.

Rosewood massages his sore temples in anticipation of things to
come.

CUT TO:
INT. INTERNAL AFFAIRS DIVISION - NIGHT

It's after hours and most of the office lights are off. A small
spotlight burns over Rosewood's desk as he sits at his computer
and searches an IAD database.

Axel and Taggert hover over him.

TAGGERT
So this is what IAD looks like?
Guess it's familiar territory
to you, huh, Axel?

AXEL
Blow yourself.

TAGGERT
It's a very nice office, Billy, but
what're we doing here again?

ROSEWOOD
I'll show you in a second.
46
A full page report appears on Rosewood's computer, along with a
color photograph of a familiar redhead REENA O'BRIEN -- Lola's
friend.

AXEL
That's her! That's the redhead who got
hit with Lola! The pro!

ROSEWOOD
You're kidding?

TAGGERT
(confused)
Who's Lola?

AXEL
What do you got on the redhead?

ROSEWOOD
A few weeks back, this Reena comes in
to file an official complaint about a
vice officer named Eddie Stone.

TAGGERT
Yeah, I remember Stone. Crazy bastard.
Spent more time in IAD than any cop I
ever knew.

ROSEWOOD
According to her, Stone busts her one
night, but instead of taking her to
county they go see this guy. This rich
Chinaman up in the Hills they call 'The
Maestro'. That ring a bell to you?

TAGGERT
Maestro? Never heard of him.

ROSEWOOD

Anyways, he gives her an envelope full
of cash and says “you work for me now”.
That same night, they go to her place,
pack her things and move her into this
mansion.

(beat)
Now this Reena said she wasn't the only
one. There's at least thirty to forty
other girls living in this house.
47

TAGGERT
Picking them up off the street. Just
like they did Ricky.

ROSEWOOD
Right.

AXEL
So who is he? The Chinaman?

ROSEWOOD
That's just it. Before she can finish
giving her statement she flips out and
splits. I guess she decided against at
the last minute. Never gave his name.

TAGGERT
(impatient)
So what you're saying is...you still
have no idea who this guy is?

Rosewood cracks a knowing smile.

ROSEWOOD
I didn't say that.

AXEL
So you do know him?

ROSEWOOD

I ran the name 'Maestro' as an alias
through Interpol. I got a match with
a guy named Harry Phan. He's been
linked to everything from smuggling in
drugs from China to trafficking young
women. It also turns out he's been
buying up real estate all over Los
Angeles.

(beat)
Hotels, restaurants, a Chinese grocery,
a whole foods distributor. You name it,
he's got it.

Axel and Rosewood wave away the nasty cigar smoke.

TAGGERT
Bought and paid for with drug money.
48

ROSEWOOD
That's what it looks like.

AXEL
So Reena wanted out, came to IAD to rat
out some cops and got cold feet. Decides
it was easier just to split town and
come back to Detroit. But what's this
gotta do with Lola?

TAGGERT
I don't know. It would help if I knew
who the hell Lola was.

Axel laughs. He smacks Taggert in the belly on his way to the
door.

AXEL
Come on. I'll tell you all about it in
the car.

Taggert follows him out as Rosewood shuts off his computer and
then the desk light.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Time to make a pit stop.

CUT TO:
EXT. “THE PIT STOP” GAS AND SUSHI - NIGHT

Axel, Taggert and Rosewood drive up in Rosewood's Lexus as the
three curious friends observe this spectacular joint.

This is no ordinary service station, from the structure's post
modernistic design to the glowing NEON LIGHTS streamlining the
building, and the gorgeous female VALET, with fake breasts and
a form fitting mini-skirt, parking cars for dinner.

At every gas pump is a drop dead gorgeous woman filling tanks
and taking orders for a full car detail.

Axel laughs as he stares through the car wash's large window,
watches a crew of silver bikinis detail a FERRARI. A wild
STROBE LIGHT illuminates the room as LOUD MUSIC blares.

It's a regular dance party.
49
INT. ROSEWOOD'S CAR - MORNING

TAGGERT
I gotta say, I've seen some strange
things in my time but I've never
had sushi from a gas station.

Rosewood seems surprised.

ROSEWOOD
Really?

AXEL
That's why it's perfect. Makes for a
good front. No one would ever think to
eat here.

ROSEWOOD
I don't know. I hear they make a mean
dragon roll.

AXEL
Tell you what. I might be in here
awhile. Why don't you guys go get
us some food. I don't know about
you guys, but my belly's growlin'.
It's gonna be a long night and even
longer on an empty stomach.

TAGGERT
In other words, you're goin' at
this alone and you don't want us
messing up the works?

AXEL
No offense, but with you guys walkin'
in there, they gonna smell the cops
comin' a mile away. And let's face
it. You guys were never cut out for
undercover work.

TAGGERT
So we're supposed to just sit here
and wait?

ROSEWOOD
Just like old times.
50

TAGGERT
That's what I'm afraid of.

AXEL
You got the money?

TAGGERT
Ten thousand smacks.

Taggert hands a thick envelope to Axel.
TAGGERT (CONT'D)
This better work, Axel. This is John's
life you're carrying around.
AXEL
It's a good thing my shit always works
then, isn't it?

Taggert and Rosewood share a look and roll their eyes in unison.

AXEL (CONT'D)
An hour.

Axel steps out, heads for the door. Rosewood squints, confused.
ROSEWOOD
A long night? What does he mean long
night?
INT. THE PIT STOP - NIGHT
Axel steps inside and takes it in. A full grocery center with
a fine wine and liquors section and cigar shop on one side and

a posh SUSHI BAR and restaurant on the other.

A shifty looking character in a flash vest and goofy bow tie is
standing behind a mahogany desk marked “Reservations”.

Axel watches as the young DESK CLERK sniffs from a small nasal
spray bottle. His eyes wide and dancing.

Axel laughs as he approaches the desk.

The Desk Clerk spots him coming and fumbles with his tie.
51
Axel plays nervous as he puts on a pair of shades and carefully
watches his back.

AXEL
(thug voice)
Hey, my man. Someone call a plumber?
Cos I'm here to snake the drain.

DESK CLERK
Snake the drain?

AXEL
You know? Unclog the pipes?

The Desk Clerk is still clueless.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Okay, this still ain't sinkin' in.
How about this.

Axel plays nervous as he watches his back and leans on the desk.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Let's say I gotta use the bathroom,
okay? But the shit's busted. There's
a sign on the door sayin' I can only
go number one. Number one's cool. I
gotta go number one real bad.

The Desk Clerk just shakes his head in confusion, not following
along.

AXEL (CONT'D)

But let's say I'm in there awhile.
All the sudden, I decide I wanna sit
down and stay for awhile. Maybe go
number two. Now, do I gotta decide
before I go in there if I'm doin' a
number one or number two?...Or can

I wait and see if the mood hits?

Axel nervously rubs the back of his neck as the Desk Clerk
slowly cracks a smile.

AXEL (CONT'D)
You see what I'm sayin' to you now?

The Desk Clerk finally nods with understanding.
52
DESK CLERK
Yes, sir. I believe so.

INT. PIT STOP/1ST FLOOR/VIP ROOM - NIGHT
Axel makes it past the front desk and heads for an elevator but
spots a slew of YOUNG LADIES in evening gowns and well-dressed

BUSINESSMEN bellied up at a bar, drinking martinis.

Axel swipes a GOLD CARD into a slit near the elevator doors as
the shiny gold doors open. He steps inside.

INT. PIT STOP/2ND FLOOR/VIP ROOM - NIGHT
Axel steps off the elevator and is greeted by a long couch full
of beautiful YOUNG LADIES in slinky lingerie. They all stand in
unison, greet him with a foney smile.
AXEL

Yes. This could definitely be a long

night.
INT. ROSEWOOD'S CAR - NIGHT

Rosewood and Taggert watch the building, bored, same old shit as
they wait for Axel.

Taggert sips a black coffee.

TAGGERT
I can't believe I'm doin' this shit
again.

ROSEWOOD
Come on, Sarge. You're having fun.
Admit it.

TAGGERT

Oh, yeah. Sitting out here, waiting on
Axel. Not knowing what the hell's going
on. This is great.

Rosewood grows visibly irritated.
ROSEWOOD

It wouldn't kill you to say that you
miss me. Just a little.
53
Taggert rolls his eyes, talks to himself.

TAGGERT
I'm sorry, Billy. I'm not happy about
being here. But if I have to be here
...then I'm glad it's with you.

Rosewood hides his goofy smile.

ROSEWOOD
Me too, Sarge. I feel the same way.

TAGGERT
You're not gonna slip me the tongue,
are you?

Rosewood loses his chipper smile. He huffs under his breath.

ROSEWOOD
That's not funny, Sarge.

Taggert watches Rosewood closely.

TAGGERT
Hell you talkin' about?

ROSEWOOD
Nothing. Just be careful with the gay
jokes around me. That's all.

Taggert scans his old partner up and down as he puffs on his
cigar. He gives up and plops down in his seat, keeps an eye
on Rosewood.

INT. VIP ROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Axel is escorted into a perfectly lit, ultra high-tech bedroom
with king sized bed, silk sheets and mirrored ceiling.

A video camera is set up on a tripod while a FLATSCREEN TV hangs
on the wall.

Axel's paid escort SKYLER (20), great build, but a foney product
of too much plastic surgery, sprawls out on the bed, poses on it
seductively as Axel watches.

Axel holds the envelope of money behind his back.
54
SKYLER
Are you gonna stand there all night?
Or are you gonna get comfortable?

AXEL
I'm comfortable, thanks.

SKYLER
So what's your name?

AXEL
Does it really matter?

SKYLER
So you're one of those guys who likes
to get right to it. That's cool.

She pats the bedsheets, invites him over.

SKYLER (CONT'D)
Why don't you get a little closer?

Axel tosses the envelope of money onto the sheets in front of
his date. She flips through the cash.

SKYLER (CONT'D)
Wow. I've got my work cut out for
me, don't I?

AXEL

That money's not for you. It's for
your boss. I got a message for him.
Inside the envelope he'll find the
name and address of where I want the
money delivered. Then I want him to
send a message along with it. Ten
grand, compliments of John Taggert.
His debt's officially paid off.

SKYLER
I don't understand.

AXEL
You don't need to understand. You
just need to send the message. And
tell your boss if he doesn't do it
...there's some cops who might be
interested in his little operation.
55

SKYLER
So you're just gonna leave me this
money?

AXEL

I figured you would ask me that, so
let's be clear. I'm gonna be calling
to see if he got that money. If he
doesn't have it come morning...and if
I think you ran off with it, stole it
or whatever...I'm gonna let your boss
know all about it. And then I'm gonna
drop his name, along with you and all
your girlfriends names to the cops.

Skyler gazes down at the envelope, sick to her stomach.

AXEL (CONT'D)
That's it. Have a good night.

Axel heads for the door.

AXEL (CONT'D)
You're doing a very good job here.

Skyler stares at his pants, smiles.

SKYLER
Yeah, I can see that.

Axel bashfully covers himself on his way out.
SKYLER (CONT'D)
Come back and see me when you have
some time!
CUT TO:

INT. ROSEWOOD'S CAR - MORNING
Axel, Taggert and Rosewood watch the front door closely, waiting
patiently as Taggert rubs his sore eyes and Rosewood struggles

to keep his head up.

TAGGERT
Okay, now what?
56
The sound of Taggert's voice startles Rosewood out of his sleep.

AXEL
Be cool, man. Now all we gotta do is
follow the money.

TAGGERT
I still don't get it.

AXEL
What's there to get? It's very simple.
We're giving Johnny's share of the
money back, and still paying off his
football debt. Meanwhile we can get
this Eddie Stone by the ass all at the
same time when we catch him with the
money.

Rosewood rubs his temples, a nervous habit.

ROSEWOOD
Blackmailing cops? This...this is not
good. At all.

AXEL
What're you getting all worked up about?
I thought you wanted to bust this guy?

ROSEWOOD
By handing him a bag of stolen cash?
It's not exactly what I had in mind.
I'm Internal Affairs now, Axel. I
could lose my job.

TAGGERT
(furious)
Your job? What about John? He's got a
little more than his job on the line.

ROSEWOOD
Sorry. I'm just saying.

AXEL
Would you guys relax? You're not gonna
lose your job and nothing's gonna happen
to John. We got this.
57
Rosewood spots the familiar face of Eddie Stone heading out the
front door with the envelope of cash.

ROSEWOOD
Hey. It's him.

Taggert quickly sits up. Axel uses binoculars to watch Stone as
he heads to his Mercedes.

AXEL
Where did he come from?

ROSEWOOD
He's leaving. He must've been in there
the whole time.

AXEL
He took the bait.

ROSEWOOD
Now what?

He lowers the binoculars, smiles at the others.
AXEL (CONT'D)

Now we go to breakfast. Fuck do you

think? Now we tail him and follow

the money.
Rosewood waits until Stone pulls out of the lot and slowly
follows behind, staying safely out of view.
EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - MORNING
As Rosewood's Lexus enters Mulholland Drive, a whole swarm of
black and white patrol cruisers, lights flashing, box them in,
forcing them to the curb.
TWO OFFICERS leap from the car in front of them, guns drawn and
moving in.

INT. ROSEWOOD'S CAR - MORNING

ROSEWOOD
What the hell is this?
58
AXEL
Looks like your boy Stone made us.

ROSEWOOD
They're stalling us.

TAGGERT
(sarcastic)
Ya think?

ROSEWOOD
It's okay.

Rosewood turns to the others.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
You guys are with me. Just keep quiet
and let me do the talking.

OFFICER #1 draws down on Rosewood from the driver's side.

OFFICER #1
Out of the car! Keep your hands where
I can see them!

ROSEWOOD
(to Officer)
It's okay! I'ma cop! I'm just gonna
reach for my badge!

Rosewood reaches in his coat as the Officer breaks his pistol
through the window, shards flying onto Rosewood's lap.

OFFICER #1
Hands...on the dash!

TAGGERT
(to Rosewood)
I feel safer already.

With a goofy expression, Rosewood slowly raises his hands up as
Taggert does likewise. Axel places his hands on the dash.

AXEL
(frustrated)
Fuck.
CUT TO:
59
INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY

Axel and Taggert rest on a steel slab bench as Rosewood paces on
the dirty floor, shakes his head, mumbles. There's a DRAG QUEEN
in skirt and pumps sitting next to Axel and watching Rosewood's

nervous fit.

TAGGERT
Quit it, would ya?

ROSEWOOD
Quit what?

TAGGERT
That thing you're doing.

ROSEWOOD
What thing?

TAGGERT
Pacing and mumbling. I hate it when
you do that. You don't have to
whisper, ya know? It's no secret
you're pissed off.

ROSEWOOD
When I get nervous I talk to myself.

TAGGERT
You're nervous? You're making me
nervous.

ROSEWOOD
You're not the one about to lose your
job.

TAGGERT

Your job? What about losing the money?
We don't even know where it is.

DRAG QUEEN
(to Axel)
What're you in for?

AXEL
I'm about to be in here for killin' a
couple cops.
60
DRAG QUEEN
You too?

Axel nonchalantly shifts in his seat, faces away from the drag
queen and watches Taggert and Rosewood.

AXEL
How much longer we gotta be in here?

ROSEWOOD
I don't know. They impounded my car so
I got us a ride. She'll be here in an
hour, maybe less.

AXEL
She?

TAGGERT
I got an idea, Billy. Why don't you
flash your badge. That'll scare their
pants off.

Axel laughs. Rosewood hangs his head in shame. A CORRECTIONS
OFFICER opens up their cell. Axel, Taggert, and the drag queen
stand. He fixes his skirt.

c.O.
You got a visitor.

Axel, Taggert, Rosewood head out. The C.O. points at Rosewood.

C.O. (CONT'D)
Just you, Lieutenant.

The three friends share a befuddled look.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Rosewood is escorted inside by the Corrections Officer where he
is greeted by IAD Inspector Weinberg.

Rosewood huffs with exhaustion and frustration. He shakes his
head at Weinberg who is ear to ear smiles.

ROSEWOOD
They send you to give me my walking
papers, Weinberg?
61

WEINBERG
I should be so lucky.
(nods to a chair)
Sit down, Lieutenant.

Rosewood sits down in protest. Weinberg stands.

ROSEWOOD
So you wanna know about the money?
Where it came from?

WEINBERG
That won't be necessary.

Rosewood is visibly confused.

WEINBERG (CONT'D)
I know all about your friend Taggert
and his kid. I also know that your
friend Foley is in town and is
helping you break open this Harry Phan
investigation. I'm here to tell you
to stop.

ROSEWOOD
Who sent you?

WEINBERG
I've been working in conjunction with
federal agents who've been tracking
Phan's activities for the last seven
months. Including his involvement with
several officers in this police
department.

ROSEWOOD
You knew about Phan this whole time?

WEINBERG
I've got a number of undercover officers
in the field trying to get on Phan's
payroll. Eddie Stone included. You and
your friends almost blew his cover with
that little stunt you pulled. If Phan or
any of his associates find out a police
officer is blackmailing Stone, he'll have
him killed just to be on the safe side.
62
WEINBERG (CONT'D)
You know, the feds want your job for
compromising their guy. Thanks to me,
I made them a better offer.

ROSEWOOD
What?

WEINBERG
I told them I'd make you a deal. We
use that money to take care of your
friend Taggert's football debt and you
walk away. Leave Harry Phan alone.

Rosewood halfheartedly scoffs under his breath.

ROSEWOOD
Why didn't you tell me? I mean...this
whole time?

WEINBERG
Because I knew you wouldn't let it go.
You'd insist on getting involved in the
investigation. I'm here to tell you
that if you don't let this go, word will
leak about Taggert's kid and that money,
and your involvement in attempting to
bribe an undercover officer.

ROSEWOOD
Don't beat around the bush, Weinberg.
Tell me how you really feel.

Weinberg sits on the edge of the desk, stares Rosewood down with
a dead serious look.

WEINBERG
It's up to you, Rosewood. What's it
gonna be?
INT. WAITING ROOM/COUNTY JAIL - DAY
Axel, Rosewood and Taggert drag ass as they wait behind a white
iron gate. A BUZZER sounds and the door opens as a CORRECTIONS

OFFICER escorts the three buddies out.

Axel smiles and laughs as he spots --
63
JENNY SUMMERS (50s), now a red head, still beautiful, awaiting
them all in chairs. She stands, gives a coy smile as she folds
her arms and observes this motley crew.

JENNY
I knew this day was coming soon
enough.

CUT TO:
EXT. SEA HORSE MOTEL/VENICE, CA - DAY

This modest motel was once a beautiful beachfront inn, but has
been beaten down by its hard partying guests as LOUD RAP MUSIC
blares from the parking lot and SCANTILY CLAD HOOKERS walk in
and out of the many rooms.

Thugged out cars and low-rider trucks sit parked in front of the
several motel room doors with their engines running and stereos
blasting.

One HOOKER counts her money as she is getting picked up by her
ride, waiting in the lot.

INT. SEA HORSE MOTEL/FRONT DESK -— DAY

Detectives BENSON and DIEGO await in a back room near the front
desk as the motel's owner --

CARL (40s), three day beard, stressed out and tired, frantically
searches for his smokes under a stack of unpaid bills. He finds
one and sparks up.

CARL
You guys think you're walking out of
here with thirty percent of my take
for the month, then you're wrong!

BENSON
Is that right? Officer Stone's gonna
be real disappointed.

CARL
These fuckin' kids are savages! Drug
deals, hookers, guns! Your little
operation's destroyed my business!
They're supposed to keep things nice
and quiet! That was the deal!
Carl gets

Diego and

64
DIEGO
Hey. You're making money. What's the
problem?

in his face.

CARL
Every couple hours, I got vice in here
threatening to shut me down if I
don't start cleaning house!
(beat)
You tell Stone this wasn't part of the
deal! I was supposed to get protection!

BENSON
Is that all?

CARL
No! It's not all! You tell him if he
doesn't start beefing up security around
here, I'll be the first one to drop a
dime to the cops! And if he still wants
his cut, he knows what to do! You tell
him that! Now go screw! Both of you!

DIEGO
I'll be sure he gets the message.

Benson head out as Carl watches them leave and gulps

down his double shot of crown royal.

EXT. EDDIE STONE'S HOUSE/POOL DECK - DUSK

Benson and Diego follow Stone, in his swim trunks and an open

robe, out
a gin and

a sliding glass door and onto a pool deck as he sips
tonic.

Stone heads for a wet bar near the deep end to get a refresh on

his glass.

DIEGO
Your boy at the motel's ready to crack.
I think he's ready for a sit down.

STONE
You collect the money?
65

BENSON
No. Not yet.

STONE
Good. Don't. Let him think he's in
charge. We got him right where we
want him.

Stone grabs a pitcher of gin and tonic, pours another glass.

STONE (CONT'D)
Now onto other business. This shit
stick cop Rosewood is starting to
really irritate me.
(beat)
Someone's been doing some talking.

Stone pours an extra glass. Diego and Benson turn and stare at
one another.

DIEGO
Whadd'ya mean?

STONE
Rosewood's IAD. Him and his buddy
Foley got a lead on our operation at
The Pit Stop. One plus one equals a
rat.

DIEGO
You got any leads on who it is?

STONE
Oh. I have a pretty good idea.

Stone reaches under a magazine and grabs a silenced TWENTY-TWO
pistol, swiftly turns, fires at Diego's head.

Pow!

-- as the bullet blows Diego's face apart and his body is FLUNG
INTO THE DEEP END.

Benson is in shock as he watches his dead partner's body fill up
the pool with blood.

Stone isn't phased in the least as he removes the silencer.
66
STONE
I figure Rosewood got to one of you.
If I was wrong about him, that means
you're the rat.

Stone nods to Diego.

STONE (CONT'D)
Take a good look. If you don't want
that to happen to you, then you're
gonna take care of this Rosewood.
Once and for all. Show me that I
didn't make a mistake by bringing you
in on this.

BENSON
What about Taggert and Foley?

STONE
You're a real smart cop, Benson. You
figure it out.

Stone sips his drink and heads for the door. Benson just stands
in awe of this shocking turn of events.

STONE (CONT'D)
Get this cleaned up. I have company
coming over.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK

It's the eighteenth floor of this half-way constructed five star
hotel in the making. No walls or windows, just brick, cement
and foundation.

A cool breeze blows a swift wind through the hollow passages of
this unfinished building.

Harry Phan, Stiggs, a few of Harry's goons, and NIKOS THOMOPOLIS
(50s), balding, spiked hair, arms dealer, stroll the floor.

HARRY
We're still months away from a completion
date and now they're threatening to shut
down construction until I can cover the
remaining costs.
67
HARRY (CONT'D)
I can only move so much money before
the IRS starts asking too many
questions.

THOMOPOLIS
And that's where I come in, right?
That's why you invited me up here.
And here I thought it was for the
pretty view.

Thomopolis smiles as he steps closer to the edge and stares out
into the bright orange sunset. The Santa Monica pier ferris
wheel lights glowing in the distance.

HARRY
I'm your most loyal customer, Nick.
As you are mine. What I'm proposing
is taking our partnership a step
further.

Thomopolis turns, bored with the conversation.

THOMOPOLIS
Don't jerk me off, Phan. I jerked
off enough in prison. What do you
want?

HARRY
You put up the rest of the money and
I'll guarantee major purchases on
your next five shipments.

Thomopolis laughs.

THOMOPOLIS
From the sounds of things, you'll be
in jail long before that. Besides.
I don't believe in guarantees. I
believe in money.

HARRY
My empire is continuing to grow at an
unprecedented rate. And...
(beat)
...I have protection. The kind of
protection a man in your position can
only dream of.
68
Thomopolis can feel Stiggs watching him like a creep in the
corner. An evil scowl on his face.

THOMOPOLIS
Yeah, your men are making me feel
warm all over. I got butterflies.

Harry cracks a smile.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

Carl, our nervous manager from the Sea Horse Motel, drags froma
cigarette and runs his hand across the pier's railing, waits not
so patiently as he checks his watch every few seconds.

He turns, stunned to see Harry Phan waiting some ten feet away
and puffing his own cigarette.

A couple of his delinquent SOLDIERS cover Carl from both ends of
the pier, boxing him in.

CARL
Shit, man. You scared me.

HARRY
Please excuse the time. I hope we
haven't kept you waiting.

Carl watches the two soldiers on either side of him, making him
nervous and unsure.

CARL
I said I wanted to meet alone. No
guns and no goons. Just us.

HARRY
Now that wouldn't be very safe this
time of night. Carrying around all
this money myself.

Carl notices that one of the soldiers is carrying a backpack of
some sort on his shoulder.

CARL
Money? What're you talking about?
69
HARRY

I hear you're not happy with your

current role. Officer Stone tells me

the police have caught wind of our

operation and made life difficult

for you. Because of this you're being

pressured to come forward.

Carl grows even more nervous as the two soldiers step closer to
him, looking very angry.

CARL

Yeah, well, they're not leaving me much
choice. They're gonna shut me down if
I don't do something.

(beat)
Stone gave me a guarantee this wouldn't
be a problem. Now, all of a sudden, I
got cops all over my ass.

HARRY
I understand. The police can be very
stubborn in their pursuits. They get
wind of something...they just don't let
up until they get their man. It's the
cost of doing this kind of business,
Mister Dunn. A business that you just
aren't cut out for. Unfortunately,
your involvement in this has made the
officers in my charge uncomfortable to
say the least.

Soldier #1 with the backpack steps forward, causes Carl stress
as he steps back.

CARL
What's he doing?

HARRY
This is your early retirement, Mister
Dunn. All you have to do now is hand
over control of the motel to me. You
let me and Mister Stone worry about
keeping the police in check.

Soldier #1 unzips the bag and throws it on the pavement in front
of Carl.
70
CARL
I see what this is. Whadd'ya think, I'm
stupid, Phan? You and your hoods running
me out of my own motel. I bet those same
cops are in your pocket too. Well forget
it. I want back in. Fifty percent.

HARRY
I'm afraid that's not an option. Our offer
is more than sufficient, Mister Dunn. If I
were you I'd take it and not utter one more
fucking word about it.

Carl notices Soldier #2 going for a gun and pulls his own piece
from inside his coat. He draws down on Harry.

CARL
Back off!

Harry motions to Soldier #2 to lay off his gun. He slowly pulls
his hand out of his pocket.

HARRY
That won't be necessary. You will take
this money and we will not speak of this

again.
(beat)
This is a war you cannot win. Don't be
foolish.
CARL
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to think this
over. In the meantime, you're gonna

sweeten the deal. JI want another hundred.
Payable by the week's end. If you don't
have it by then, I'm going to the police.
We'll see how loyal your cop friends are
after they're brought in for questioning.

Harry thinks it over. An insincere smile.
HARRY
I'll have to take it to my people. You're
a very shrewd businessman, Mister Dunn.

And also very stubborn. We'll be in touch.

Carl grabs the bag of cash, makes his way off the pier.
71
EXT. PARKING LOT/BEACH - NIGHT

Carl carries his bag of cash over his shoulder as he leaves the
beach and cuts across a small parking lot. He spots a shaggy
looking SURFER GIRL leaning on his car and smoking a joint.

She stumbles toward him, playing the role.

SURFER GIRL
Say, buddy. You wanna buy some shit?

CARL
No, I don't. Get the hell away from
my car.

The Surfer Girl almost trips on her own feet as she steps even
closer.

SURFER GIRL
Come on, man. Just a bag. You should
mellow out. Maybe we can go somewhere,
make you feel good.

She reaches for his face, strokes the side of his cheek with her
fingers.

CARL
Get out of my way you dirty bitch.

SURFER GIRL
What's your problem, man? We should
take a little walk on the beach and
chill. I'll hook you up, ya know?
Come on, man. Show me some money.

Carl gets fed up, drops his bag of money and pulls his gun as he
sticks it in her face.

CARL
I said get out of here!

Before he knows what's happening, Carl is grabbed from behind as
an arm is wrapped around his throat and he drops his weapon.

The Surfer Girl takes off, into the night as a couple more THUGS
appear and take turns throwing Carl a beating.
72
THUG #1 knees him in the crotch as Carl falls to his knees. The
man behind him releases his throat as THUG #2 kicks him in the
chest and knocks him to the asphalt.

All three men, all dressed like pot-head beach bums, take turns
kicking and beating Carl to a pulp.

THUG #1 wraps a long wire around Carl's throat and finishes the
job as the other two watch.

Carl finally gives as Thug #1 releases him, lets him fall to the
ground. Dead.

EXT. RICKY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jenny's BMW convertible parks in a guests spot in front of the
high-priced complex. Several palm trees and a colorful flower
garden circle a sign that reads “BEVERLY TERRACE”

INT. JENNY'S BMW - NIGHT

Jenny behind the wheel, Axel shotgun and Rosewood and Taggert in
the back seat, looking whipped.

JENNY
Okay. I thought we were going for a
nice after dinner drink. Does anyone
wanna tell me what's going on?

ROSEWOOD
Look at this place. Hard to believe
Ricky living in a place like this.

TAGGERT
And they say crime doesn't pay.

JENNY
Who's Ricky?

AXEL
I guess it would be asking too much
if you waited in the car.

Jenny watches Rosewood and Taggert in the rear view mirror being
suspiciously quiet.
73

JENNY
Oh, no. No, no, no.

AXEL
I'll just be a minute or two, tops.
Rosewood here will keep you company.

JENNY
You're unbelievable. You said you
weren't working. You promised me.

AXEL
I did? I don't remember saying that
shit.

Axel turns to the fellas in the back.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Do you guys remember me sayin' that?

Rosewood and Taggert shake their heads in unison.

AXEL (CONT'D)

(to Jenny)
They don't remember you sayin' that.
I don't think you heard me right.
You should probably have your ears
checked or somethin' like that. Maybe
cut your hair.

(redirects)
Which is looking very nice, by the way.
Very beautiful.

JENNY
Cut the shit, Axel. I remember you very
specifically saying that you were in town
on vacation and wanted to catch up. Next
thing I know, I see you with Heckel and
Jeckel here coming out of a jail cell.

Rosewood and a cigar chomping Taggert share a look.

JENNY (CONT'D)
Then you lied to me again when you said
it was all just a big mix-up. I guess I
didn't hear you right.
74

AXEL
No, you didn't. But it's okay. I forgive
you.

Jenny huffs in exhaustion.

AXEL (CONT'D)

And I'd love for us all to catch up and
have a drink. Tell you what. When
we're done here, we can all go back to
your place and relax, okay? Have a few
drinks and who knows.

(beat)
We can all spend the whole night together
if you want. Have like a big sleepover.
But right now, I gotta go upstairs with
Taggert. Let you and Rosewood have a
chance to get reacquainted.

Rosewood doesn't seem keen on the idea as he shuts his eyes and
mumbles under his breath. Taggert watches him, curious.

Jenny stares at Rosewood in the rear view mirror, and she's just
as enthused for this plan.

JENNY
Wonderful.
(stares at Rosewood)
Be still my beating heart.

AXEL
Billy, you don't mind stayin' with Jenny
and keeping her company, right?

Rosewood rolls his eyes.

ROSEWOOD
Wonderful.

Axel notices Jenny and Rosewood giving each other a dirty look
and shares an exchange with Taggert, who also senses some
hostility in the air.

AXEL
Wonderful.
(to Taggert)
You hear that, Taggert? Wonderful.
75
Taggert watches Rosewood rub his sore eyes.

TAGGERT
Wonderful.

Taggert and Axel step out, leaving a frustrated Jenny and
Rosewood alone.

JENNY
A sleepover? What is he talking
about, sleepover?

INT. RICKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Axel and Taggert push open the already busted open door as Axel
does a quick sweep of the front room, gun drawn.

The place is a disaster. The cushions of the couch flipped, and
the back of a leather recliner ripped to shreds as white foam
stuffing covers the carpet.

Taggert checks the messy kitchen.
KITCHEN

Every cabinet door and drawer have been flung open or dropped on
the floor, leaving a mess of kitchen utensils, tools and other
silverware.

Also on the ground are various pots and pans and other cookware.
A round kitchen table rests in the corner with a full can of
coffee dumped onto the surface.

Several bags of potato chips and crackers have also been poured
onto the table.

TAGGERT
Call me obvious...but I think someone
was having a hard time finding that
money.

LIVING ROOM
On the carpet, Axel picks up a busted picture frame as he avoids

being cut by the glass. It's a picture of Ricky having a drink
at a club with a hot waitress on his shoulder, both smiling.
76
A look of surprise on Axel as he slowly figures out that the
girl is SKYLER, his paid escort at The Pit Stop.

AXEL
Hey, Taggert.

Taggert slowly shuffles his way into the living room.

TAGGERT
What is it?

AXEL
This girl with Ricky. It's the same
chick I saw at The Pit Stop.

Taggert grabs the photo, takes a look for himself.

TAGGERT
What was she? A waitress?

AXEL
This girl does a whole lot more than
bussing tables.

TAGGERT
I wonder if Ricky's aware of that.

AXEL
My guess is he is.

Taggert squints, confused.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Those girls are charging two grand a
head and the place was crawlin' with
suits. They take in a whole helluva
lot more than twenty k a night.

TAGGERT
What're you saying? That Johnny was
lying about the twenty grand?

AXEL
I'm saying if Ricky ripped this place
off, he took a lot more than twenty
thousand, whether John's aware of it
or not.
77

TAGGERT
A place like that, you can't just run
in with a ski mask and stick up the
place.

AXEL
Exactly. Ricky says he worked for this
guy Phan. Maybe he was the bag man. He
gets the money from point A to point B,
only --

TAGGERT
-- It never gets to point B.

Axel ponders it all. A moment of realization hits him like a
sack of bricks.

AXEL
I'm gonna check the bedroom.

Axel hurries to a corner bedroom as Taggert follows behind.

INT. RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Axel flips on the lights and notices a perfectly made bed in the
center of the room. The drawers of a large oak armoire have been

pulled and dumped to the carpet, only they are empty.

Axel bites his lip, in deep thought. He opens up a closet door
and finds it completely empty. No clothes, hangers, nothing.

AXEL
Yo, Taggert!

INT. RICKY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
Taggert notices the sink is spotless with an empty toothbrush
stand on top. He opens up a medicine cabinet and finds it is

also empty.

TAGGERT
Yeah?

Axel enters.
78
AXEL
You notice anything strange?

TAGGERT
Yeah. Doesn't look like anyone
lives here.

AXEL
Ricky didn't come runnin' back here
after the wedding. It would be the
first place they'd look for that
cash. He packed his shit long before
that.

TAGGERT
Ready to skip town.

AXEL

No wonder he was so nervous at the
wedding. He knew they were lookin'
for him. Which probably means he
worked for them as a currier. It's
the same thing that got my friend
Mikey killed. When the shit turns
up missing, they don't exactly have
to narrow down the list to find out
who did it.

TAGGERT
If they know he's the last one to
touch the cash, why risk taking it?
It doesn't make sense.

AXEL
A kid like Ricky grew up with nothing
and spent half his life living on the
streets. He probably got sick at
starin' at all that cash and lost his
head.

TAGGERT
Okay, so where is he?

Axel stares down at the broken photo of Ricky and Skyler.
AXEL

I don't know. Maybe we should ask
Skyler and find out.
719
INT. JENNY'S BMW - NIGHT

Rosewood now in the front seat with Jenny. They are strangely
quiet, avoiding each other as Rosewood sneaks a few peeks here
and there.

ROSEWOOD
I never thanked you for coming to get
us.

JENNY
(angry)
Yeah, well, if I knew why, I wouldn't
have.

Rosewood obviously bites his tongue and fights hard to restrain
from responding.

He takes another look at Jenny, not so mad this time, but more
a look of nostalgia, secretly fond of this woman.

ROSEWOOD
You know, I haven't told him.

JENNY
Told who what?

ROSEWOOD
About us. Whadd'ya think I meant?

JENNY
As far as I'm concerned, there's not
much to tell.

Rosewood seems sad, almost offended.

ROSEWOOD
I didn't think it was that bad.

Jenny scoffs at him, shakes her head.

JENNY
Yeah, Billy, it was the best month of
my life.

ROSEWOOD

You don't have to be so cruel about it.
80
Jenny sees Rosewood sulking, feels bad.

JENNY
That's not what I meant.

ROSEWOOD
What did you mean?

JENNY
We were an unnatural act. A case of
mistaking wild coincidence as fate.

ROSEWOOD
What the hell are you talking about?

JENNY
We were single, lonely and depressed.
We just happened to be in the same
supermarket at the exact same time
waiting in the exact same line.

ROSEWOOD
(reflects)
Lane three.

JENNY
We just let things move way too fast
because you thought it was meant to
be.

ROSEWOOD
Maybe it was. But I guess we'll never
know because you were too scared to
find out.

Rosewood starts to boil. He tries to bite his tongue but can't
quite do it.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
And I never said it was fate. I just
thought that since...
(thinks it over)
...well...never mind.

Jenny won't let it go.

JENNY
Since what?
81
ROSEWOOD
Well, I was gonna say I may've got
the wrong impression when you came
onto me at the art gallery.

Jenny bursts out laughing.

JENNY
Are you on drugs?

ROSEWOOD
You gotta admit, you were definitely
throwing a sexual vibe my direction.

Jenny neurotically begins rubbing her sore temples as she shuts
her eyes.

JENNY
I have a headache all over my body.
Please stop speaking, okay?

Rosewood spots Axel and Taggert heading for the car.

ROSEWOOD
Here they come.
(beat)
We'll talk about this later.

JENNY
I'll try to keep my hands to myself
until then.

Axel and Taggert jump in. Axel carries an ANSWERING MACHINE on
his lap. Ricky's answering machine.

ROSEWOOD
Well? How'd it go?

AXEL
It's coming together.

Axel notices how upset Jenny is.

AXEL (CONT'D)
How'd it go here?

JENNY
Wonderful.
82
Axel smiles, checks with Rosewood.

ROSEWOOD
Wonderful.

Axel laughs.

CUT TO:
INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Through the front door walks Jenny, Axel, Taggert, and Rosewood
as Axel marvels at the high-priced digs before him. Jenny has

moved up in the world since we saw her last.

An entire collection of eclectic artwork hangs from the wall,
relics of the now closed Hollis-Benton Gallery.

A pricey crystal chandelier dangles from the ceiling above the
spiral staircase.

AXEL
Yo, man. It's lifestyles of the rich
and famous.
(stunned)
Is this your house?

Jenny scoffs.

JENNY
Stop acting so surprised.

Rosewood rolls his eyes as he strolls the living room with his
hands in his pocket, disinterested and unimpressed.

ROSEWOOD
(smug)
It's her boyfriend's. The doctor.

Jenny bumps Rosewood out of the way as she follows Taggert and
Axel into the kitchen.

KITCHEN

AXEL
Thought maybe you stole it or somethin’.
83

TAGGERT
You'd know about stealing houses,
wouldn't you, Foley?

AXEL
Touche.

Taggert grabs a plastic barbecue lighter from a drawer, sparks
up a cigar.

Jenny yanks it right out of his mouth.

JENNY
Don't even think of lighting that
tobacco asshole in this house.

AXEL
Yeah, we wouldn't wanna ruin the smell
of new money.

Axel laughs.

TAGGERT
No kidding.

JENNY
Paul is bronchial. The faintest smell
of cigar smoke and he'll kill me.

ROSEWOOD
We wouldn't wanna upset Paul, now would
we?

AXEL

Ya know, I haven't been a cop for awhile

but I'm sensing some tension in the air.
(to Taggert)

Whatta you think, Taggert?

TAGGERT
The air is a bit thick.

ROSEWOOD
Let's just say Jenny got a better offer.
A bigger wall to hang all her pretty
artwork.
84

Jenny gives up and heads to a liquor cabinet, pours all of them
a nice double shot.

Taggert gets a very upset, almost confused look on his face.

TAGGERT
You and Jenny were an item?

AXEL
Get the fuck outta here.

ROSEWOOD
Yes, it was a very brief affair to say
the least.

Jenny hands everyone a drink except Rosewood.

JENNY
Yes, and Billy hasn't been able to let
it go.

Rosewood steps uncomfortably close to Jenny.

ROSEWOOD
That's because Jen has been unable to
accept the fact that she still has
feelings for me.

JENNY
Where do you get this stuff?

Jenny turns her back on him, gulps down her drink as if he's hit
a sensitive nerve.

ROSEWOOD
The eyes, Jen. The eyes never lie.

TAGGERT
I taught him that.

AXEL
Hold up. I just thought of something.
Billy and me shared a woman.

JENNY
(embarrassed)
Axel!
85

ROSEWOOD
(surprised)
Really? That's news to me.

JENNY
That's cos it was a one time thing and
we were kids. And we were drunk at the

time.

AXEL
Well you don't have to make it sound so
cheap.

JENNY

Gee, I'm sorry, Axel. What girl doesn't
dream of getting it in the back of a
Chevy Nova?

Axel laughs. Taggert still looks confused as he rolls a cigar
in his mouth.

TAGGERT
So...you and Billy...and Axel? I don't
suppose you could...

JENNY
No, I don't suppose I could!

ROSEWOOD
John. Take it easy. Show some respect.

Jenny seems flattered by his goofy gesture, but tries to hide a
smile.

TAGGERT
(to Jenny)
Sorry.

AXEL

Yeah, Taggert, show some respect.
(to Jenny)

So who's better? Me or Rosewood?

Jenny goes for an instant refill on her vodka rocks.

JENNY
Oh my God.
86

Rosewood shakes his head with disgust at Axel and Taggert's rude
comments.

ROSEWOOD
Come on, guys.

AXEL
Hey, Jen. I'm sorry really. I'm being
bad again. Didn't mean to put you on
the spot like that. My bad.

Rosewood makes a desperate gesture for Axel to lay off. Taggert
laughs under his breath.

Axel pauses. He can't hold it any longer.

AXEL
So who's bigger? Me or Rosewood.

JENNY
On that note, I'm taking a shower.

Rosewood seems to like that idea.
JENNY (CONT'D)
(to Rosewood)
Alone.

Jenny storms off, out of the kitchen and up the stairs.

AXEL
Damn, man, what did you do to her?

ROSEWOOD
I guess...maybe it's possible I came on
too strong.

TAGGERT
Noooo.

Rosewood slumps down at a kitchen table. Depressed and tired.
ROSEWOOD
Women. Can't live with em. Someone fix

me a drink.

Axel laughs. Taggert heads for the liquor cabinet.
87
INT. JENNY'S SPARE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Axel splashes some cold water in his face, freshens up a bit as
Jenny leans on the open door frame, watches him with a smile.
Axel is caught by surprise.

JENNY
Just making sure you're not stealing a
bathrobe or something.

Axel laughs. Jenny gives him an overdue hug.

JENNY (CONT'D)
So, what's this I hear about you not
being a cop?

AXEL
Well, I figured there's only so many
times you can be passed over for
promotion before you realize it's never
gonna happen. Plus, I thought I could
make better money on my own.

Axel hops up on the sink as he pulls a business card from his
wallet, hands it to Jenny.

JENNY
(reads card)
Axel Foley Investigations.

AXEL
I guess you could say my past finally
caught up with me.

JENNY
Yeah, no offense, but I don't really
see you as Captain material.

AXEL
What, you can't see me in a suit and
tie behind the desk with Rosewood?

JENNY
No, I can't.

AXEL
Yeah, me either. But it's okay though.
Business is good. I'm happy.
88
AXEL (CONT'D)
How bout you? I hear you're a nurse.

JENNY
Yeah, an RN. That's how I met Paul.
He's a surgeon.

AXEL
Oh, obviously.
(smiles)
And?

JENNY
And what?

AXEL
Do you like him?

Jenny cracks a goofy grin.
JENNY

Of course I like him. What kind of
question is that?

AXEL
So what about Rosewood? What happened
there?

JENNY

Nothing. It happened. Now it's over.
Don't worry about it.

Jenny playfully shoves Axel as she steps out. Axel laughs.
CUT TO:
EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE/SWIMMING POOL DECK - NIGHT

Taggert's pants are rolled up as he soaks his sore feet in a hot
tub and puffs his cigar.

Rosewood sits at a laptop doing some research. Jenny sips ona
gin and tonic as Axel appears through a sliding glass door. An
answering machine in his hand.

He goes to Rosewood, checks over his shoulder, reviews the open
web page.
89

AXEL
Rosewood. What're you reading?

ROSEWOOD
It's an IA database. With my password,
I can access it from any computer.
This is everything I have on Harry Phan.

Rosewood scans through a digital file of crime scene photos, all
unsolved homicides, stabbings, shootings, overdoses, all younger
men and women in their teens and twenties.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
There's been over two dozen juvenile
deaths in the greater Los Angeles area
in the last month. All of the victims
have one thing in common. All John and
Jane Does. No ID, no history, no next
of kin. And all unsolved.

Axel takes the mouse and scans through a few more images of the
unsolved homicide cases.

IMAGES

-- a young HOMELESS MAN is found dead under a bridge, surrounded
by newspapers and other garbage.

-- a TEEN GIRL is face down in an alley. An overdose. A large
line of people waiting to get into a club is seen in the near
distance.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
These are just a few of em. Stabbings,
shootings, overdoses.

TAGGERT
This is LA, Billy. It's not really that
uncommon.

ROSEWOOD

I showed some photos around at the local
homeless shelters. They identified over
a third of the deceased.

Taggert and Axel share an intrigued look. Jenny hears the
doorbell, heads out.
90
AXEL
This guy Phan is recruiting them straight
out of the shelters.

ROSEWOOD
Makes them an offer they can't refuse.
A place to stay, a free supply of junk.
More money than they've ever seen.

AXEL
And when the cops get too close...

ROSEWOOD
Or they become too big a problem to
handle, he bumps them off.

Through the sliding glass walks Jenny and her surprise guest JAN
BOGOMIL (48) short blonde hair, professional look with matching

business suit, successful.

Axel, Taggert and Rosewood light up as she enters the pool deck.
A big smile on all their faces.

AXEL
Look at this!

JAN
Hey, trouble maker.

Axel and Jan share a big hug. Jenny twirls her ice cubes as she
throws Rosewood a dirty stare.

AXEL
What the hell're you doing here?

JAN
Nice to see you too, Axel.

Axel laughs. Jan waves at Taggert.

JAN (CONT'D)
Hey, Uncle John.

TAGGERT
Hey, sweetie.

Jan leans in and gives Rosewood a hug around his neck, gives him
a big wet kiss on the neck and mouth.
91
Jenny shakes her head in disgust. Axel and Taggert share a big
confused smile.

Axel points at Rosewood, and then Jan, pieces it all together as
he turns to Jenny. She rolls her eyes.

JAN
Hey, babe.

ROSEWOOD
How was your day?

JAN
A lot better now.

Jan gives him another wet one on the mouth. Jenny sticks her
finger down her neck as Taggert laughs.

TAGGERT
(to Rosewood)
You and Bogomil's daughter?

JAN
Thanks, Uncle John. I almost forgot
my real name.

Axel laughs.

AXEL
When did this happen?

JAN
Oh. I guess you could say it was an
accident. There I was waiting in line
at the supermarket...

Jenny and Axel share a funny look. Taggert can't help but smile
as Rosewood bashfully looks away.

JAN (CONT'D)
And out of nowhere comes Billy. We
hadn't talked in almost two years,
and just like that. There he was. I
guess you could call it fate.

JENNY
Yeah. Fate. It's a funny thing.
92
Jenny takes another huge belt of her gin and tonic.

Rosewood quickly changes the subject.

ROSEWOOD
So anyways. What did you find out today?

JAN
So much for memory lane.

Jan hands Rosewood a manila file full of paperwork. He takes a
look at the thick set of papers.

JAN (CONT'D)
Your friend Harry Phan's been a busy boy.
He's being investigated in at least eight
counts of insurance and tax fraud. He
owes something in excess of four to five
million in back taxes.

Taggert is now intrigued as he crawls out of the hot tub, joins
the others.

JAN (CONT'D)
And that's just what we were able to find.
God knows what else this guy's into.

ROSEWOOD
Anything else?

JAN
My guy in the IRS says Phan's big thing
now is targeting failing businesses that
are struggling financially, offers a
third of what the property is worth while
the owner takes the money and runs.

Taggert hangs on every word as he slowly takes a seat next to
Jenny. She waves away his nasty cigar smoke.

JAN (CONT'D)
Meanwhile, the seller keeps his name on
the books while Phan stays in the clear.
When the IRS gets wind of what's going on,
Phan moves on to his next target. This
guy's making millions under the table.

Axel seems focused. He hurries back to the laptop.
93
AXEL
Rosewood. Go back a few photos. I
wanna check something.

Rosewood grabs the mouse, moves through the still images until
he stops on the YOUNG GIRL in the back alley. A nightclub in
the back ground.

Axel points at the long line of people in the distance. There's
some chinese writing on the wall in bright glowing NEON LETTERS.

Axel sets

AXEL (CONT'D)
There. That club across the street.
Where is this?

ROSEWOOD
It's this club on Pico. The Dragon Room.
Why?

AXEL

Listen to this.
down the answering machine, presses play.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Me and Taggert grabbed this from Ricky's
apartment. See if you recognize this
voice.

BENSON (V.O.)
Times up, Ricky. The way I see it, me
and you got a problem. Stone wants you
and your friends dead and I want that
money. So I'll make you a deal. If you
ever wanna see that sweet young thing of
yours again, you'll bring me the full
ninety thousand.

ROSEWOOD
Benson.

BENSON (V.O.)
I'll tell Stone your dead, and we can
all go our separate ways. Like this
never happened.
(beat)
Dragon Room. Midnight. If you're one
second late, the girl's dead.
94
BENSON (V.O.)
Don't worry, Ricky. I'm on your side.
I hope you're not stupid.

Axel hits stop on the machine.

ROSEWOOD
What girl?

Axel pulls the photo of Skylar and Ricky from his pants pocket.

AXEL
This girl. It's the same girl I saw
at The Pit Stop. My guess...her and
Ricky were both involved in stealing
that money.

TAGGERT
He said the full ninety. That means
her and Ricky took over a hundred gees.
No wonder they're so pissed off.

Axel stares at the still image of the dead young woman laying in
the back alley.

AXEL
The bigger question is...who's this
dead girl in the alley?

ROSEWOOD
She's an overdose. Her friends called
in a 911 emergency. Supposedly, she
just collapsed right there in the alley.

AXEL
What was the name of the girl who called
this in?

ROSEWOOD

Lisa, Linda, Layla. Something.

AXEL
Lola?

Rosewood suddenly realizes who it is. He slumps in his chair
with a surprised look on his face.

Axel seems annoyed as he quickly digs up Lola's photo.
95
He shoves it in Rosewood's face.

AXEL
Is this her?

ROSEWOOD
I never talked to her. She disappeared
before I could question her.

AXEL
Man, you guys still need me, don't you?
Lola was killed because she knew
something. She was either involved in
this girl's death or tried to blow the
whistle. Either way, they killed her
for it.

Another realization hits Rosewood.

ROSEWOOD
The redhead. Reena!

AXEL
Lola was too scared to come forward
about Stone, so she sends her friend
Reena instead. It's all coming
together now.

TAGGERT
Okay. I'm lost.

AXEL
Rosewood took a statement from a girl
about a bad cop. That was Reena. My
guess is she was either there that night
with Lola or decided to come forward to
keep her friend in the clear.

Rosewood checks his watch.

ROSEWOOD
It's after nine. We got less than three
hours before Ricky meets with Benson.

AXEL
That is, of course, if Ricky got the
message. But it looks like Ricky's
long gone.
96
ROSEWOOD
We're talking ninety thousand dollars
here. We should assume that Benson got
in touch with him by now. If not at
home, then on his cell.

AXEL
In the meantime, we got three hours to
come up with a game plan. Otherwise,
Ricky's a dead man.

ROSEWOOD
We're gonna need a car.

JAN
Mine's a two seater.

Axel smiles. They all turn to Jenny.

JENNY
No way.

AXEL
So did he fly to that medical conference
or drive?

Jenny laughs.

JENNY

CUT TO:
EXT. THE DRAGON ROOM/PICO BLVD - NIGHT

A spotless, shined up Cadillac Escalade parks in a red zone near
the front door and out steps Axel, Rosewood and Taggert.

Axel is wearing a dark hoodie, a black leather racing jacket and
shades as he pretends to be incognito. Rosewood and Taggert act
as bodyguards as they stare down the crowd waiting in line.

The crowd turn and whisper to one another, point at Axel as they
wonder who he is.

The three men skip to the front of the line as a buff DOOR MAN
is choosing who enters the club.
97
AXEL
Say, my man. Sorry I'm late. Traffic
was a bitch. Excuse us.

Axel snaps his fingers at Rosewood and Taggert and they follow
him toward the door like lapdogs.

The Door Man lays his hand on Axel's chest, stops him.

DOOR MAN
Hold it right there, flash. The line is
that way.

Points his beefy finger down the street.

AXEL
Line? Ain't no line, cousin. I'm the
entertainment. Mister Phan requested I
be here no later than eleven thirty.
It's eleven thirty five. We're supposed
to be set up, ready to turn this mufucka
out by midnight. So do me a favor and
get your big monkey ass out my way before
I gotta call Mister Phan and handle this,
see?

DOOR MAN
You know what I think? I think you and
The Oakridge Boys here ain't on the list.
I think you're full of shit. So how bout
you beat it before this big monkey turns
you all into banana pudding.

AXEL
Alright. You wanna do it the hard way?
Fine.

Axel removes his shades, drops his hoodie, and quickly flashes
his identification.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Axel Foley. Fire Marshall.
(to Taggert)
Would you frisk this man, please?

DOOR MAN
What is this?
98
Taggert approaches. The Door Man shoves him back.

Rosewood flashes his holstered gun.

ROSEWOOD
Sir, I suggest you cooperate or there's
gonna be trouble.

The Door Man slowly raises his arms as Taggert does a pat down
and discovers a small automatic pistol.

DOOR MAN
What's this about?

AXEL
I'll tell you what this is about!
This property just happens to be
in violation of section PL90X and
867-5309 of the fire safety code!

The Door Man squints with confusion.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Don't even get me started about the
inside of this place! But you got
people lined up down the streets
blocking not one, not two, but three
fuckin exits and a fire escape!

The Door Man plays like he's checking down the street. He's not
following along as he shakes his head with frustration.

AXEL (CONT'D)

Now I was gonna be a gentleman and
come inside and give Mister Phan the
opportunity to fix this! Instead,
you chose to insult me and assault
one of my marshalls! On top of this,
you're carrying an unlicensed firearm!

(to Rosewood)
Mister Rosewood! Cuff this man!

DOOR MAN
Now hold on a second. I don't want any
trouble. I'm just the door man.

The crowd in line start to get ugly as they shout obscenities at
all four of the men.
99
AXEL
Yeah, well. I'm afraid you had your
chance to cooperate, sir.
(to Rosewood)
Are you gonna cuff this man or do I
have to do it?

Rosewood continues toward him. The Door Man steps back.
DOOR MAN
Hey, look. You wanna talk with Mister
Phan, then go on. Alright? I just do
what I'm told.

AXEL
Rosewood. Back off.

Rosewood backs away from him.

DOOR MAN
Can I go now?

AXEL

Yeah, you can go. Get the hell outta

here. Don't let me see you again.
The Door Man jets as the rowdy crowd erupts. Axel and the others
head inside before they're trampled by the incoming clubbers.
INT. THE DRAGON ROOM CLUB - NIGHT
Axel, Taggert and Rosewood move through a busy crowd, walk in on
a Chinese Dragon Dance already in progress. The dragon zig zags
its way through an array of glass table tops where clubbers are
seated.
At each table, a torch is lit.
The dancers move to the beat of the DRUMS as they glide across
the floor.

INT. PHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Harry Phan and Stone watch Axel, Taggert and Rosewood from his
two-way office window.
100
HARRY
And here they are. Right on time.

STONE
Yeah. I wouldn't start celebrating
just yet. It's quarter to and still
no sign of the kid.
Harry turns to him. A growing smile.
HARRY
Don't worry. He'll be here.
INT. THE DRAGON ROOM CLUB - NIGHT
Axel, Taggert and Rosewood take a seat at one of the glass table
tops. Axel scans the floor for any signs of Ricky or Skylar as

he spots --

SKYLAR picking up a drink order at the bar. She turns and spots
Axel. A smile.

ROSEWOOD
Axel. Isn't that her?

AXEL
I see her. You guys hang back.

Axel pats Rosewood on the chest as he heads for the bar.
BAR

Axel hurries to catch up with Skylar, who carries her tray to a
corner booth. He grabs her by the arm as she turns to him.

A smile.
SKYLAR
Look who it is. I guess you changed
your mind.

Axel flashes the photo of her and Ricky together.

AXEL
You wanna explain this?

Skylar checks the photo. She doesn't follow.
101
SKYLAR
He's a friend. So what?

AXEL
So we need to find a place to talk.
Like, right now.

Axel grabs her by the arm and drags her into a corner.

SKYLAR
Hey, you don't need to do that. You
wanna talk, we'll talk.

Skylar turns her attention to a long, mirrored wall in the far
corner of the room. She sets down her tray of drinks, grabs
Axel by the arm and walks him toward the wall.

There's a small slit in the glass as Skylar uses an ID CARD that
is chained to her skirt to open up the private room.

The mirrored wall opens up as Skylar and Axel head inside.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

Skylar shoves Axel into a leather chair as she hops on his lap
and starts an erotic lap dance.

SKYLAR
There. Now isn't that better?

AXEL
We don't have much time. He'll be here
any second.

SKYLAR
Look man. There's cameras all over this
place. If you don't want me to get in
trouble, then act like you're enjoying
this.

AXEL
Tell me what happened at The Pit Stop.

SKYLAR
I don't know what you're talking about.

Axel grabs her, makes her stop.
102
AXEL
Then that must've been some other girl
Benson was talkin' about killing if
Ricky don't show with that money by
midnight.
Skylar sits in shock.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Oh, do I have your attention now?

Skylar huffs in frustration. She comes around.
SKYLAR
Look, I let him crib at my place, but
I'm not involved in any of this. I
even told him and Ginny they were nuts
for going through with it.

AXEL
Ginny. Who's Ginny?

An exit door in the far corner opens and in walks --
RICKY

with a back pack full of money. Ninety grand. He and Axel catch
eyes, both surprised to see each other.

A sudden realization hits Axel like a sack of bricks.

EXT. MIRRORED WALL - NIGHT

Two GUNMEN lock and load their machine guns and take aim at the
glass wall. One of them is Benson.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Axel shoves Skylar and himself to the floor.
AXEL
(to Ricky)

Get down!

The glass wall is RIDDLED WITH AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE as Ricky is hit
with several shots. He falls to the ground. Dead.
103
The bag of money also falls limp to the floor.

As the glass wall explodes and breaks into large shards on the
carpet, Axel raises his gun and FIRES MULTIPLE SHOTS.

One of the men is struck in the shoulder and chest and falls to
the floor. Benson escapes down the hall.

Axel checks on Skylar.

AXEL
You okay?

SKYLAR
No, are you crazy?

Axel checks on Ricky. Now dead.
In runs Taggert and Rosewood, guns drawn.

ROSEWOOD
Axel!

TAGGERT
What the hell happened?

AXEL
Never mind that! Take the girl and get
her outta here! Fast!

Axel chases down the hall after Benson.

INT. DRAGON ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT
Axel fights his way through a busy crowd as they gather near a
back room bar and congregate on a tall staircase overlooking a

dance floor.

Axel spots Benson at the top of the steps, making his way toward
the roof.

STAIRCASE
Axel pushes and shoves his way up the steps.

CUT TO:
104
EXT. DRAGON ROOM/ROOFTOP BAR - NIGHT

Benson pushes a circle of friends having some wine out of his
way - runs to a steel railing at the edge of the roof.

A full view of the street. He's run out of places to hide.

Axel makes his way onto the roof as Benson spots him. Benson
raises his gun in the air and FIRES A FEW SHOTS.

The panicked crowd almost runs over Axel as they head for the
stairs. They knock his gun to the ground.

One of the clubbers plays hero and attempts to grab Benson's gun
from his raised arm.

During the scuffle, Benson drops his gun and punches the man in
the mouth.

Axel jumps him as the two almost fall over the railing. Benson
grabs Axel's throat, chokes him as Axel digs his thumb into his
throat.

Benson releases him as the two men gasp for air. Axel throws a
hard right hook and knocks Benson --

OFF THE ROOF
and

THROUGH A CHINESE ENGRAVED SKYLIGHT

INT. DRAGON ROOM/DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

Benson falls through the glass and onto a lighted DANCE FLOOR
where clubbers SCREAM and run for cover.

SKYLIGHT

Axel's face appears over the railing as he stares down at the
dead cop on the dance floor. His BLOOD spills out in gushes.

EXT. DRAGON ROOM/ROOFTOP BAR - NIGHT

Axel is out of gas, drops to his knees.
105

INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Skylar sits on a couch, shaking. Her nerves are shot. Axel and
the others hover over her, pump her for questions.

Jenny enters with a cup of coffee. She hands it to Skylar and
takes a seat.

SKYLAR
Thank you.

AXEL
You're awful lucky you didn't get all
of us killed back there.

SKYLAR
They were gonna kill me! What would
you do?

ROSEWOOD

They were gonna kill you anyways.
You set us up.

AXEL
You said Ricky and Ginny took that
money. Who's Ginny?

Axel grabs a photo of the dead girl in the alley from Rosewood.
Shoves it in Skylar's face.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Is this Ginny?

Skylar is quiet at first, but comes around.

SKYLAR
Ginny worked at The Dragon Room as a
waitress.

AXEL

A waitress? You mean an escort.

SKYLAR
Congratulations, cop.

AXEL
I'm not a cop.
106

This is news to Taggert and Rosewood as they share a confused
look. Axel showes Skylar a photo of Lola Marcus.

Skylar is

AXEL (CONT'D)
I was hired to find this girl by her
father.

ROSEWOOD
You know her, don't you?

SKYLAR
Yes. She also worked at the club as
a dancer. Her name's Lola. I don't
know what happened to her. I haven't
seen her in weeks.

AXEL
Tell me what happened to Ginny. She
didn't die of natural causes. Phan
had her killed and I wanna know why.
Did they find out her and Ricky stole
that money?

SKYLER
A few weeks back, Ricky tells me this
cop Eddie Stone was working for Phan.
He said this other cop found out he was
on Phan's payroll and opened an
investigation on him.

ROSEWOOD
What was his name? This cop?

SKYLER
I don't know. All I know is Stone
supposedly sent Ginny to get her hooks
into this cop. Get him all hot and
bothered and bring him back to The Pit
Stop for a quick roll.

ROSEWOOD
Why?

shocked by his stupidity.
SKYLAR

Whatta you mean why? They wanted to
catch him on tape. Use it as blackmail.
107

TAGGERT
So they killed her to cover their
tracks?

SKYLAR

No. Ginny got greedy. Her and Ricky
came up with this plan. They burned a
copy of the blackmail video of her and
this cop, then played both sides.
Taking money from Stone and the other
cop at the same time.

ROSEWOOD
Weinberg.

Taggert and Axel turn to him.

TAGGERT
Who?

ROSEWOOD
Weinberg. He's IA. No wonder he's been
putting up so much resistance. He's been
working under the table for Stone this
whole time.

Rosewood paces the floor. Flustered. He's been played for a
fool by Weinberg.

AXEL
(to Skylar)
How was Lola involved in all this?

SKYLAR
They sent Lola to spike Ginny's drink.
She didn't know they were gonna kill
her. She was supposed to just walk her
to her car and drive her home.
When she collapsed in the alley, Lola
freaked out and called the cops.

AXEL
So that's why she split town. She was
afraid the cops would find out she
killed her.
108
SKYLAR
What's gonna happen to me now?

AXEL
Nothing. You're gonna stay here for a
couple days until we can figure this
thing out.

This is news to Jenny.

JENNY
She is?

CUT TO:
INT. HARRY PHAN'S ESTATE/BASEMENT GYM - NIGHT

STIGGS is busy kickboxing a punching bag in Phan's high tech gym
and the room is dark. A simple light illuminates this corner of
the room.

A dark presence enters the gym and waits by the door. Stiggs is
stopped by the sound of a door creaking open, turns.

HARRY
We have a problem.

The almost black silhouette of Harry Phan steps closer into the
light as his face is fully revealed.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Officer Benson is dead and our police
friends have the girl.

Stiggs ignores Harry, hits and kicks the bag as he moves ina
tight circle.

HARRY (CONT'D)
It seems our involvement with Detective
Stone has become more trouble than it's
worth. I'm counting on you to take
care of it.

Stiggs finally stops, faces Harry, who offers nothing more but a
smile as he exits the room.

CUT TO:
109
INT. EDDIE STONE'S HOUSE/DINING ROOM - MORNING

Stone stares down at the back pack filled with ninety thousand
dollars in cash sitting on a pricey glass dining table.

He is locked in on this money - focused. Stone rubs the stubble
on his face in a nervous fit, paces the floor. Several pieces of
luggage are packed and ready as they rest on the tile.

Stone is shocked to see --

WEINBERG

standing in a door frame, his gun aimed and ready to shoot.

WEINBERG
Going somewhere, Stone?

STONE
What the hell're you doing in my
house?

WEINBERG

If you think I'm going down alone,
you're crazier than I thought.

STONE
You have one other option. You can
kill the girl, along with Rosewood
and Foley.

WEINBERG
So, paint an even bigger target on my
back while you're sitting on a beach
with ninety grand? I don't think so.

STONE
So you came here to take the money?

WEINBERG
No. I came here to kill you and take
the money.

STONE
Not very smart. Killing a cop. You're
in enough trouble as it is. The way I
see it...you need me.
110

WEINBERG
I need you? How?

STONE
To get Rosewood and Foley out of the
picture. For good. Tonight.

Stone cautiously steps closer to Weinberg, who gets nervous and
backs out of the dining room, into the living room.

STONE (CONT'D)
Your only other option is to run. And
you won't get far. Not as long as
they're alive. You know this.

WEINBERG
Stay back.

Stone forces him further into the living room.

STONE
We're running out of time. If we're
gonna do this, I need you to focus.
No more games.

LIVING ROOM
Weinberg pulls back the hammer on his pistol.

WEINBERG
I said get back.

STONE
Don't be stupid. Without me, you're
dead. Drop the gun.

And from behind a wall jumps STIGGS with a hypodermic needle as
he jams it in Stone's neck. Stone collapses to the tile floor
as Weinberg lowers his weapon.

WEINBERG
There. You got him. Now give me
the money.

Stiggs cracks an evil smile as he nods toward the dining room,
gives Weinberg the signal to grab the cash.
111
Weinberg hurries back into --

THE DINING ROOM

and snags the bag of money from the glass table. He checks to
see if Stiggs is watching him and bolts for the front door.

CUT TO:
EXT. EDDIE STONE'S HOUSE/DRIVEWAY - MORNING

Weinberg rushes to his car, jumps in with the bag of money.

INT. WEINBERG'S CAR —- MORNING

Weinberg sticks in his key. Not a click. Nothing. The car is
completely dead.

WEINBERG
Start, you sonofabitch!

Weinberg spots Stiggs standing in front of his car. A MACHINE
GUN aimed, locked and ready.

THE WINDSHIELD IS RIDDLED WITH AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE
- as Weinberg is quickly killed.

Stiggs cracks a toothy grin as he heads for the passenger side
door, grabs the money from the empty seat.

CUT TO:
INT. EDDIE STONE'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Stone's unconscious body sits limp in an expensive recliner as
Stiggs places a FORTY FIVE in his lifeless hand.

Stiggs is now wearing goggles and covered in a black trash bag
material from head to toe. He holds the forty five to Stone's
temple, pulls the trigger.

Pow!

A bright CRIMSON RED sprays across a white leather couch and a
marble coffee table.
112
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS/GRASSY BLUFF - DAY

Harry Phan's Mercedes limo sits in an empty field overlooking a
very scenic downtown Los Angeles.

Harry leans on the hood, smokes a cigarette as Stiggs arrives in
his car and parks some few feet away.

Stiggs steps out with the bag full of ninety thousand in cash as
he slowly approaches.

HARRY
May I presume that Mister Stone is no
longer?

Stiggs nods.
HARRY (CONT'D)
Good. But Foley and Rosewood have become
a bigger problem than I had first

anticipated.

One of Harry's soldiers steps out of the limo with another bag
of cash. Harry takes it, unzips and flashes it to Stiggs.

HARRY (CONT'D)
One hundred thousand.

Harry zips it up, tosses it in the dirt in front of Stiggs.
HARRY (CONT'D)
If Foley and Rosewood aren't dead by day's
end...I'll have no choice but to assume
you split with my money. And then I will
kill you. Is this understood?

Stiggs smiles, heads back to his car, throws the bag inside as
he steps in. Harry smiles as Stiggs drives off.

CUT TO:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS/TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

Stiggs exits a dirt road and enters the thin, two lane blacktop.
He picks up speed as he ventures off on his mission.

CUT TO:
113
INT. STIGGS CAR - DAY
Stiggs uses a free hand to unzip the bag of money, peeks inside
and spots a stack of cash. He hears a slight TICKING under the
pile of money.
He pushes away what turns out to be a short stack of bills and
discovers a BOMB just three seconds from detonation.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS/TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

As Stiggs car careens out of control --

BOOM! It explodes into a hundred pieces of flame and rubble. A
BLAZING TIRE bounces over a bluff and down a hill.

Phan's LIMO passes and a rear window lowers. And Harry sneaks a
quick look at his handy work.

OVER BLACK

SUPERIMPOSE: ONE MONTH LATER

INT. UTOPIA HOTEL AND SPA/BANQUET ROOM - DAY

The room sits half in the hotel, half on a sand dune overlooking
the beach, no walls or windows, just an open deck with Greek-

like pillars holding it all up.

Every table in the room is filled with eager faces, all dressed
to the nines, sipping momosas or having coffee.

Harry Phan sits at a stretched table under a giant banner that
reads UTOPIA HOTEL AND SPA GRAND OPENING.

Nick Thomopolis sits at a table up front, flashy suit and tie.

The gorgeous HOSTESS takes to the podium to welcome everyone for
coming. A tall, Chinese-American goddess in a thousand dollar
gown with fake, oversized breasts.

HOSTESS
Welcome. And thank you for coming
to the grand opening of the Utopia
Hotel And Spa.
114
The crowd erupts with applause and cheers.

HOSTESS (CONT'D)
As a token of our appreciation for
your support, you will find at your
tables a one week complimentary pass
for you and a guest. All expenses
paid.

The crowd all reach for a stack of cards at the center of their
respective tables as the room fills with excited chatter.

HOSTESS (CONT'D)
Of course...none of this would be
possible if it weren't for one man.
A man with a true vision. Please
put your hands together for my
husband...Mister Harry Phan.

The room fills with deafening applause as Harry takes to the
podium, kisses his wife.

Before he can utter his first word --
AXEL struts his way to the front, microphone in hand.

AXEL
That's right! The man of the hour!
Mister Harry Phan! Give it up!
I said give it up for Harry!

Axel claps his palms together, causing some REVERB on the hot
mic in his hand.

The crowd all cover their ears.

AXEL (CONT'D)
I gotta tell you, nobody's as excited
to be here as I am. To be here...side
by side with my friend Harry Phan. To
celebrate this special day. I can tell
he's just as excited to see me here.

Harry shoots him the look of death.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Look at the look on his face. Priceless.
115
AXEL (CONT'D)
As many of you already know...Harry
has sacrificed a lot to be here.
And faced just as many challenges
along the way.

Thomopolis shifts in his seat, covers up his face from view as
Axel pats him on the shoulder.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Nick Thomopolis, ladies and gentlemen.
From guns and drugs to hotels. Good
to see you, Nick.

Thomopolis gives a quick wave hello to the crowd as he buries
his face in his hands.

Axel paces the floor under the podium as Harry gives him the
thousand yard stare.

AXEL (CONT'D)
But one thing you need to know about
Harry...is when he sets his mind to
doing something, he don't let anything
or anyone get in his way. Not the FBI,
the IRS, not even a federal indictment
can stop Harry from opening his hotel.

The crowd all turn and stare, whisper to one another.

AXEL (CONT'D)
And it's not just him that deserves the
credit. As I look out here into this
crowd...I see the many faces that have
also sacrificed themselves and their
time to fulfill Harry's dream.

There are several tables up front filled with Harry's young men
and ladies. His “soldiers”.

AXEL (CONT'D)

Most people would say fuck it. I can do
this on my own, but not Harry. He says I
don't care how we raise the money. Stand
on the corner, sling drugs, prostitute
yourself, it don't matter.

(beat)
All that matters is the vision.
116
A couple of Harry's Soldiers, dressed in white tuxedos, begin to
the front of the room, eyes on Axel.

AXEL (CONT'D)
And I see many faces here today, that have
not only given themselves, but have sold
their own bodies for this man, Mister Harry
Phan.

As the two soldiers draw closer, Harry warns them off with a nod
and a simple wave of the hand.

The two soldiers reluctantly back off but hold their ground and
stare back at Axel with a look that could kill.

AXEL (CONT'D)
You might know them. They may be sitting
next to you right now. They may be your
neighbors. They may even be your sons or
daughters. You never know.

Thomopolis quietly sneaks for the exit.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Nick Thomopolis! He says congrats on the
hotel, Harry, but kiss my ass and have a
nice day. I'm out.

Thomopolis jets for the beach, never looking back. Axel gives
him a nice round of applause as he pats his two palms together
and causes another wicked REVERB.

The crowd all cover their ears.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Now I don't wanna steal the show. After
all, this is Harry's special day. To tell
you the truth, he don't have that much
longer to truly appreciate the fruits of
his labor with his upcoming trial, so
I'm gonna leave and let him enjoy this
little bit of time he has left in peace.
So thank you, Harry. Enjoy your brunch.
It's Miller time. Thank you.

Axel drops the mic on the floor as the REVERB sends the room in
an uproar. He heads for the exit.
117
EXT. BEVERLY DRIVE - DAY
Harry's limo casually cruises the palm tree dotted strip - back
to the mansion.
INT. HARRY'S LIMO - DAY

Harry sits in the back with a sour scowl on his face, sips on a
scotch rocks as he reflects on his ruined grand opening.

He peeks through the front windshield as the limo creeps over a
steep hill and is surprised to see a POLICE ROADBLOCK sitting
dead center of the posh street.
HARRY
Mother-fucker.
(to driver)
Get us out of here!
CUT TO:
EXT. HARRY PHAN'S ESTATE - DAY

Along with a couple dozen SQUAD CARS, marked and unmarked, stand
several UNIFORMED COPS, DETECTIVES, and Axel and Rosewood.

Rosewood smiles as he spots the limo creeping to a stop. Axel
also smiles as he struts down the street toward them.

The limo cuts down a side street at high speed, SCREECHING THE
TIRES on the asphalt.

CUT TO:
EXT. SIDE STREET/BEVERLY DRIVE - DAY

Harry's limo tries its best to evade authorities but SCREECHES
to a halt as FOUR SQUAD CARS block the street from both sides.

INT. HARRY'S LIMO - DAY
Harry pulls his gun as he spots several UNIFORM COPS jumping out
of their cars. He turns around, spots several more cars pulling

up from behind.

CUT TO:
118
EXT. SIDE STREET/BEVERLY DRIVE - DAY

Harry's limo is quickly surrounded with ARMED OFFICERS as they
draw down on the rear windshield and back passenger windows.

One officer forces out the DRIVER at gunpoint.

Rosewood's Lexus arrives on the scene as Axel and Rosewood step
out with beaming smiles.

AXEL
I'll be back.

ROSEWOOD
Axel. It's done. Let them handle it.

Axel walks to the limousine and signals the officers to back off
as he jumps in the back seat.

ROSEWOOD (CONT'D)
Okay. Never mind. Fuck me.

Rosewood shakes his head, gives up.
CUT TO:
INT. HARRY'S LIMO - DAY

Axel sits across from a very upset Harry. The two are silent at
first as Axel sports a big, wide grin.

AXEL
So. Here we are. I never really had
a chance to introduce myself. My
name is Axel Foley.

Axel pulls the photo of Lola from his coat pocket. Hands it to
Harry.

AXEL (CONT'D)
And that is Lola. She's the reason
I got into this mess.

Harry looks at the photo.

HARRY
Pretty girl.
119
AXEL
She was. She got killed.

HARRY
That's too bad.

AXEL
Yeah, I can tell you're real broken
up about it.

HARRY
Lola was special. Fresh. Not yet
bruised by the ugliness of the world
and so full of life and promise. I
had high hopes for her. But, like
so many others, she chose to throw it
away. And for what? Peace of mind?

Harry scoffs.

HARRY (CONT'D)
Your police department pretends to
care, yet thousands of young women
just like her are still on the
street and they do nothing.

Harry leans in closer to Axel.

HARRY (CONT'D)
How long do you think the Lola's of
this world can last on their own?
I gave her a home. I made a place
for her. And for many like her.
And your friends in the police chose
to get her killed.

Harry laughs.

HARRY (CONT'D)
For what? So they can get the bad
guy. No matter who dies in the
process.
(beat)
You think I'm the problem? My friend,
you're the problem.

Axel plays interested as he slumps forward in his seat and rests
his face in his hands in a mocking fashion.
120
HARRY (CONT'D)

You're the problem because you and all
like you refuse to face your own greed.
You see it as a cancer. Something dark
and unholy. Lola knew who she was and
what she wanted, and she went after it.
And now she's dead for what?

(laughs)
Because she chose to do the right thing?
Now don't you think if she had the
chance to do it over again, she'd do
things a bit differently?

(serious)
The hypocrisy of the police department
is almost absurd.

Axel takes a moment to soak it all up.

AXEL
You know, I was a cop for twenty five
years and I've come up against some
real nasty bastards, but you...
(beat)
You're something special.

Harry smiles and nods.

AXEL (CONT'D)

Anyways, I just wanted you to get a
good look at my face. You know, so
you can think of it every night when
you're cryin' yourself to sleep in
your prison cell and masturbating
with your own tears and shit like
that.

Harry is seconds from pulling his gun on Axel as he grips his
pistol tighter and tighter.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Do me a favor though. Just when you're
gettin' ready to finish, think 'Axel
Foley'. Every day you're gonna be
saying to yourself 'I'm in here playin'
with my own shit and never gonna get
pussy again cos of Axel Foley'.
That's what I want you to do.
121
AXEL (CONT'D)
Anyways, I don't know if you noticed
or not, but there's some cops outside
waiting, so I'll let them to it.
Take care of yourself.

Axel steps out, but stops half way.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah. One more thing.

Harry waits for it.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Fuck you.

Axel spits dead in his face. A smug smile on Harry's face as he
slowly wipes it away.

AXEL (CONT'D)
That's for Lola.

Axel goes on his way, leaves Harry to himself as the officers
quickly place him in custody.
EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE/POOL DECK - DUSK

The BRIGHT ORANGE SUNSET that started our story is back and it's
slowly falling over the ocean's still horizon.

Axel works the grill as he cooks up some dogs and burgers while
Jan sits in Rosewood's lap, feeds him fresh strawberries.

They giggle like schoolkids while --

Jenny watches them, jelly faced, from a deck chair, a drink in
hand. She rolls her eyes.

Johnny and Jordan soak their feet in the hot tub while Taggert
and retired Police Chief ANDREW BOGOMIL appear from inside with
a bottle of champagne.

Taggert blows the cork. POP!
TAGGERT

Okay. I never got the chance to properly
toast my son and his beautiful bride.
122
Johnny and Jordan smile, share a tight hug.

TAGGERT (CONT'D)
Johnny. That means you. Get your ass
over here.

They all share a laugh. Johnny and Jordan join the others as
Bogomil helps pour and hand everyone a glass of champagne.

BOGOMIL
Don't spill. This is the good stuff.
I hear we have Axel to thank.

JENNY
(curious)
Hey. Where did you get that? Did you
find that in the wine cellar?

AXEL
It doesn't matter where we found it.
The man's tryin' to give a toast.
Let him have his moment.

TAGGERT
(to Johnny and Jordan)
Here's to your never ending happiness
and to new beginnings.

Rosewood and Jan share a smile as she wipes some strawberry off
his cheek.

TAGGERT (CONT'D)
(to Rosewood)
To seeing old friends. And remembering
what's really important.

Rosewood tips his glass to Taggert, and then Axel. He also tips
his glass to Jenny who cracks a grin.

TAGGERT (CONT'D)
I know none of us are promised forever.
So I just wanted to be sure to say, just
in case I never get the chance, that I
love you. All of you.

AXEL
Here here.
123
They all chug their glass in unison. Rosewood stands, joins
hands with Jan as they join the group.

ROSEWOOD
I guess this would be as good a time as
ever to share our news.

Axel and the others brace themselves.

AXEL
You're pregnant?

BOGOMIL
Axel, please.
(to Jan)
You're not, are you?

Jan smacks Axel on the chest as Rosewood laughs.

JAN
No. I think I'll stick with three,
Dad, thank you.

ROSEWOOD
So anyways. Where was I?

AXEL
Oh, sorry. You were about to tell
your Dad you guys were getting
married. My fault.

JAN
Axel! Shit!

Bogomil is overjoyed as he gives Rosewood a giant hug, and then
his daughter.

BOGOMIL
That's wonderful.

Jenny joins them, gives Rosewood a quick hug and a kiss on his
cheek. She gives him an “it's okay” look before hugging Jan.

JENNY
Congratulations. You have yourself a
good man. Take care of him.
124
Jan wipes her tears as her and Rosewood embrace.

Jordan is jelly faced as she shoots the remainder of her
champagne.

Johnny notices she's upset.

JOHNNY
What's your problem?

JORDAN
Nothing. It's just that this was our
moment. They're stealing our thunder.

JOHNNY
You're being silly. Stop it.

JORDAN
I'm not being silly.

Axel sets his glass down and pulls Rosewood and Johnny away from
the crowd, throws an arm around each of them.

AXEL
Man, this is just too much. All of us
together. Two of my favorite guys
getting married. Tell you what. Today
is your lucky day, cos yours truly is
throwing his hat into the ring and
unselfishly volunteering himself to
throw the bomb bacherlor party to end
all bachelor parties.

ROSEWOOD
(whispers)
Axel. Not now.

Jenny smiles, crosses her arms.

JENNY
Axel...?

AXEL
No, no, no. I know what you guys are
thinking. It's not gonna be like that.
We're talking a very boring, very
straight-laced bachelor party with just
the guys. Nothing but us guys.
125
Jan points her boney finger at Axel.

JAN
No funny business.

Johnny winks at Axel. Jordan shoots Johnny a nasty stare.
AXEL
Are you kidding? Nah. I'm just talkin'
about a small get together with just the
guys, that's all.

Taggert and Bogomil share a smile.

BOGOMIL
Why do I get the feeling there's more to
this story.

AXEL

It just so happens that on the way over
here I found the perfect place for you

guys. It's nice and quiet. Absolutely
no women around. No alcohol. Very dull
and conservative. You're gonna love it.

Taggert, Bogomil, Jenny, Jan and Jordan all give him an unsure
look. He's full of it.

AXEL (CONT'D)
Trust me.

Axel turns and stares INTO THE CAMERA as WE FREEZE FRAME on his
face and trademark smile.

FADE OUT.
