“Jane D'Oh!"
Written by

Rawson Marshall Thurber

EPISODE #102
February lst, 2017

*though you're probably watching this on stolen Chinese internet and that's cool too.
EXT. RUNYON CANYON - DAY

RYAN HANSEN, shirtless and lightly perspiring (never
sweating), huffs and puffs his way up this iconic "hiking"
trail in the Hollywood hills, all the while talking directly
into his iPhone's Periscope app.

RYAN
What-what! We got straight up picked
up, ya'll! Pilot-to-series, suckas!
YouTube Red in da hiz-ouse! Brace
yourselves for five -- count ‘em --
FIVE more eps of this bad boy right
in your pie whole! Wah-DOOSH!

ON SCREEN we see a running commentary from IGS Live
watchers: Who are you? -- #WeirdAF -- Don't say hiz-ouse.

RYAN (cont'd)

YTR guys said there was a "less than
normal" viewership loss from this
crazy viral twerking grandma video
that they linked us to. Less than
normal! His words, not mine.
Crushing iiiit!

(beat)
BT-dubs, I just want to thank my co-
star, the honorable Detective Jessica
Mathers -- she made me better in
every scene. You know chemistry is a
two way street. And some times there
are stop lights and some times there
are unprotected left hand turns --
but you just keep going. Because...
traffic, right?

(faux reflective)
But I'm not gonna let this show go to
my head. It's all about finding my
center. Staying grounded. Staying
mindful. That's why I'm out here
reconnecting with nature.

Ryan pans his camera to show a literal PARADE of SHIRTLESS
MEN and HALF-NAKED WOMEN with insane bodies all walking up
Runyon, taking selfies and shooting videos as they "hike".

RYAN (cont'd)
It's so real up here away from the
hustle and bustle of the "LA scene".
Behind Ryan, a VAMPY GIRL in crazy skimpy booty shorts,
holds her phone down below her ass then brings it up to her
face where she smiles and gives a peace sign while holding a
package of "Flat Tummy Tea" she's hawking.

RYAN (cont'd)
Awesome tea. Totes works.

At the top of Runyon, Ryan pans the hazy skyline, landing
back on himself...

RYAN (cont'd)
Honestly though you guys, I don't
know how the writers are gonna
improve on the pilot. Such a barn
burner. I mean, seriously -- how do
you top opening on a dead body?

HARD CUT TO:
TWO DEAD BODIES

lying on the living room floor. We're...

INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY

Ryan, sporting a very strange 18TH CENTURY ARMY OFFICER'S
UNIFORM, kneels into frame.

RYAN
Two dead bodies.

Ryan pulls a pair of sunglasses from his coat, inexplicably
putting them on for "dramatic effect".

The crime scene has been taped off. A couple of BEAT COPS
stand watching as a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures and CORONERS
prepare two gurneys.

MATHERS (0.S.)
What the fuck are you wearing?

Ryan spins to see JESSICA MATHERS snapping on a pair of
rubber gloves.

RYAN
I've got an audition later.

MATHERS
Is it to be a talking hand-job?
Because you're nailing it.
RYAN
No. It's for Hamilton, the musical?

MATHERS
Do they serve dinner during it?

Mathers pushes past Ryan to take in the dead bodies on the
floor.

RYAN
Haw-haw. No -- it's for the movie
version. They're doing like an
action re-imagining of it without the
songs -- I'm going in for Aaron Burr
who's like the co-lead. He was
played by a black guy in the
original, but he was originally
originally a white guy, so like, I'm
kinda right for it? But not ina
racist way or anything. More like
returning to the source material or
whatever.

MATHERS
Look at me. Look at my eyes. I
literally do not give a fuck.

Ryan laughs it off.

RYAN
Hilarious. Great delivery. Anyhow,
I binge-watched that milk commercial
like a million times to get inside
his head as a character. Doing a
deep dive on this one. Pete Berg is
directing. I hear all the actors are
gonna go through Navy Seal training
for it. So cool, right? If I get
it, it could like totally change my
career. I'm just wearing this period
plumage to fully immerse myself in
the role. Streep says 80% of acting
is wardrobe.

MATHERS
Unfortunately, the other 20% is you.
(beat)
Now if you wouldn't mind shutting the
fuck up so I can do my job.

RYAN
Our job. For five more episodes.
Guaranteed. Partner.
4.

Ryan smiles smugly. Mathers sighs, but turns her attention
back to the bodies and we get our first good look at them:
late twenties, MAN and WOMAN, both dressed like they're
going to a Renaissance Fair except, bizarrely, the man's
wearing the dress and the woman's wearing the pants and
puffy shirt (Seinfeld™).

The man has a KNIFE, buried to the hilt, sticking out of his
chest and the woman's face is nearly purple, a small VIAL
rests inches from her lifeless fingers.

Mathers looks to the BEAT COP standing nearby...

MATHERS
You first on?
BEAT COP
Yeah.
(to Ryan)
Hey, Ry.
RYAN

Hey, Frank. What's good?

BEAT COP
Same old.

They laugh like old pals. Mathers is confused.

MATHERS
You know him?

RYAN
Who? Frank? Course I do. Everyone
knows The Franken-ator. Frankenstein!

Ryan and Frank do a fun fist bump thing. Mathers doesn't
like it one bit.

BEAT COP
You still owe me twenty bucks,
Hansen.

RYAN
No way! You didn't eat the whole
thing -- that was the bet!

They yuck it up a bit. Clearly, Ryan's a people person and
Mathers is deeply annoyed by that.
MATHERS
Hey -- sorry to interrupt
international grab-ass hour, but you
two mind knocking it the fuck off?

Total killjoy. Frank and Ryan straighten up.

BEAT COP
Sorry, Detective.

MATHERS
Run it for me.

BEAT COP
Happened last night. No sign of
forced entry. Nothing missing from
the house as far as we can tell. No
witnesses. Neighbor found him this
morning. Pretty thin.

MATHERS

We got names?
BEAT COP

John Smith and Jane Dough.
MATHERS

You haven't ID'd them yet?
BEAT COP

No, those are their real names.
MATHERS

God I hate this town.

(beat)
This his place?

BEAT COP
Yeah. She lives off of Melrose.

MATHERS
Do we know what's in the vial?

BEAT COP
Not yet. Lab boys are running it now.

Ryan nods, faking like he's giving this a lot of thought.

RYAN
What's your read on this one?

MATHERS
Well...they're dead.
RYAN
Yeah. Same. Same.
(beat)
What do you make of their outfits?

MATHERS
Maybe they found out they were
auditioning for the same role as you
and they killed themselves out of
shame.

RYAN
No chance. These aren't working
actors. I'd know.

Mathers shakes her head.

MATHERS
Okay, Little Lord Fauntleroy, what
you're looking at here is your garden
variety murder-suicide, with a
sprinkle of "Los Angeles normal"
cross-dressing thrown in for funsies.
Quick version: yada-yada motivation,
she stabs him...

CUT TO:

3. A CSI-STYLE GRAINY FLASHBACK--

we watch as Jane stabs John in the chest, then slugs back
the vial, instantly frothing and clutching her throat.

MATHERS (V.O.)
...then tosses back whatever Hemlock-
light is in that vial there to off
herself. No forced entry, his blood
literally on her hands. Adds up
pretty clean.

BACK TO:

MATHERS
But that's what bothers me about it.
It's too clean.

Ryan nearly jumps out of his blouse-pants.

RYAN
Oh dude! That was sick! Great line.
Total trailer moment!

(MORE )
RYAN (cont'd)
(mimicking her)
"It's too clean." So good. Can I
give you a note though? I think you
could carve it out a little more if
you add some space work to it. Check
it.

Ryan squats by the bodies, putting his sunglasses back on.
He rises, taking them off as he stares into the distance...

RYAN (cont'd)

That's what bothers me about it: it's
too clean.

(breaking)
See? Better right? I think you
should maybe consider adding a
toothpick or a match to your mouth.
Like something you're always chewing
on? Could be your "thing", plus you
know, mouth props.

MATHERS
You're a mouth prop.
(moving off)
Come on.

RYAN
Where are we going?

MATHERS
Jane Dough's place to see if we can
get some answers.

Mathers exits. Ryan calls after her, following...

RYAN
Ooh! Or a red coffee straw! Like
you're trying to quit caffeine, but
we never come out and say it -- it's
like a mystery! Baller backstory!

INT. MATHERS' CAR - DAY

Mathers drives, Ryan rides shotgun. He tugs at his collar,
sweating.

MATHERS
Why don't you take that thing off.
It's like 100 degrees out.

RYAN
Art is suffering.
MATHERS
Especially when you do it.

RYAN
Make fun, but I'm gonna nail this
audition tonight.

MATHERS

Your audition is tonight?
RYAN

9pm.
MATHERS

They hold auditions that late?

RYAN
It's kind of an after-hours thing.
The assistant associate casting
director asked me to come in after
they're closed. I guess she doesn't
want me to intimidate the other
actors. She's even keeping it off
the books. Very hush hush.

MATHERS
So...it's a secret audition?

RYAN

Exactly. I'm pretty much like the
Zero Dark Thirty of auditioning --
swoop in at night, kill Osama -- in
this case Osama would be the
audition, not like a real person --
and get out.

(beat)
So we better solve this case before
9pm tonight, or you're on your own.
Cuz nothing is keeping me from
landing this one.

(into phone)
Siri, set an alarm for 9pm tonight,
the moment my life will change
forever.

SIRI
True change comes from within.

Ryan scratches his neck...
RYAN
Seriously though, I think I might be
like legit allergic to wool. Are
these neck blisters?

EXT. DUPLEX - DAY

A modest duplex off of Melrose. Mathers and Ryan
the front door.

RYAN
So what do we know about this place?
MATHERS
We know she lived here.
RYAN
Ah. Good. Strong clue.
MATHERS
Just shut up and let me do the

talking.

Mathers knocks on the door. They wait.

RYAN
Hey -- you think I should have a
badge?
MATHERS
No.
RYAN
Really?
MATHERS
Yes.

Mathers knocks again, louder.

RYAN
Why?

MATHERS
Because you're a moron and it would
be illegal. But mostly the first
part.

RYAN
How am I supposed to give an
authentic performance if you guys
won't let me have a gun or a badge?

approach
10.

MATHERS
I guess you'll just have to rely on
the suspension of disbelief.

RYAN
Huh?

MATHERS
Stay here. I'm gonna take a look
around back.

RYAN
What do I do if someone comes to the
door?

MATHERS
Ask ‘em if they want to buy musket
insurance.

RYAN

(90% sure)

Ha -- that's not a real thing.

With that, Mathers moves off around back leaving Ryan solo
on the doorstep. Unable to be alone with his thoughts for
more than three seconds, Ryan pulls out his phone.

He fucks around with some SnapChat face apps: waggy-tongued
dog, squeaky-voiced deer, crying baby. Totally normal.

Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, Ryan spots movement
inside the apartment. He cups his hand to the front window
and sees

A HOODIED KILLER

clutching a knife, slinking through the empty apartment.
Ryan's eyes go wide.

RYAN (cont'd)
Whaaaa?

Suddenly, the bathroom door opens and out steps a stunning
SIX-FOOT BLONDE wrapped in a towel having just gotten out of
the shower.

She puts in her ear buds and moves off, unwitting. The
Killer closes in on her. Ryan whisper-screams for Mathers...

RYAN (cont'd)
Mathers! Mathers!
11.

Nothing. No answer. The clock is ticking. No time to
lose, Ryan breaks into action!

Ryan kicks the door and falls backwards eating shit into
some ADJACENT SHRUBBERY. He pops up and throws his shoulder
into it. Once, twice, thrice -- BOOM -- the door opens and
in rushes our hero.

INT. DUPLEX - CONTINUOUS
We're hand-held behind the killer as he approaches the
girl's back. She unwraps her towel. The Killer raises his

knife...

...when suddenly RYAN DIVES AT HIM THROUGH A SIDE DOOR,
yelling a warrior's cry...

 

RYAN
Clooooooney!

...and tackling the would-be assailant to the ground --
THUD!

The girl SCREAMS -- spinning to see Ryan standing on top of
the intruder, clutching the knife.
BLONDE
What the fuck man!? Who are you?!
RYAN
I'm Ryan Hansen.
BLONDE
Who?
RYAN

The Nickelodeon Slime-Time nominated
actor? I just totally saved your
life.

BLONDE
Saved my life? From who?

RYAN
From like the killer. Duh.

On cue, the Killer groans...
KILLER

Ow! I think you broke my arm,
asshole!
12.
Ryan looks down and spots the Killer who pulls off his
authentic "SCREAM" mask a GoPro strapped to his forehead.
BLONDE
That's my scene partner, douche.
We're rehearsing!

Just then, Mathers rushes in, gun drawn.

BLONDE (cont'd)
Whoa -- what the hell?!

Mathers takes in the situation, putting it together quickly.
Her shoulders slump. She sighs...

MATHERS
Dingbat -- what the fuck did you do?

Ryan looks down at the Killer...

RYAN
My bad, dawg.

MATCH CUT TO:
RYAN'S FACE ON SCREEN.

we're watching the GoPro footage. It freezes. We're...

INT. PRECINCT / CAPTAIN JACKSON'S OFFICE - DAY
...where we meet our new captain, SHARON JACKSON.

[Reader's Note: the precinct is shot in the same faux docu-
style aesthetic as THE OFFICE. ]

Lady Captain Jackson rewinds the tape in disbelief...

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Did you really yell "Clooney" before
attacking?

Mathers and Ryan sit in chairs, hang dog.

RYAN
George Clooney is my spirit animal.

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Well, your spirit animal is about to
get the city in a serious god damn
lawsuit. That Spielberg Scorsese you
assaulted is threatening to sue.
13.

MATHERS
Captain, it was an honest mist--

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Nope. Detective. You don't get to
talk. You're on thin enough ice as
it is.

RYAN
Honestly, none of this would've
happened if I had a badge.

CAPTAIN JACKSON
You want a badge? Become a real cop
and stop dressing like you're in the
Nutcracker.

RYAN
This is for my Hamilton audition.
It's period authentic.

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Well, I'm period authentic pissed
off.

RYAN
More genre authentic, but I totally
honor that feeling. And before we
dialogue further on this, can I just
say I think it's such a cool cosmic
coincidence that the old Captain
Jackson and you share the same last
name. Are you guys related?

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Why? Because we're both black?

RYAN
(stunned)
You're black? I honestly didn't
notice. I don't see color -- just
people. And auras.
(to Mathers)
Did you know she's black? Crazy,

right?
Mathers looks like she's about to die.

MATHERS
Captain -- I let him out of my sight
for two seconds, it was a mistake and
it won't happen again.

(MORE )
14.

MATHERS (cont'd)
We've got a good lead on the case and
we'll close it. I promise.

CAPTAIN JACKSON
Yeah -- you better close it. And
quickly or Vanilla Ice here won't be
the only one in this room without a
badge.
(beat)
Now get the hell out of my office.

Mathers and Ryan slink out. Ryan whispers...

RYAN
FYI, I think she meant you on the
badge thing.

Mathers shoots him a murderous glare.

INT. PRECINCT / INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

PARKER STARR, formerly the blonde in the towel, sits
opposite Ryan and Mathers...

PARKER STARR
What do you mean she's dead?

MATHERS
Well I guess I mean it literally.

PARKER STARR
I don't understand, I just saw Jane
yesterday. She was spending the
night at John's -- they were gonna
rehearse for the showcase tonight.

RYAN
Showcase?

PARKER STARR
Yeah -- it's where a bunch of actors
do scenes from other plays and movies
for casting directors.

RYAN
I know what a showcase is. I'm an
actor.

PARKER STARR
You keep saying that. Would I have
seen you on anything?
15.

RYAN
This. This show that you're
literally on right now.

PARKER STARR
This is a show? Who's it for?

RYAN
YouTube Red.

PARKER STARR
Never heard of ‘em.

RYAN
No one has. That's the point. My
partner and I here are gonna put them
on the map. Big time. Kabloom.
Emmy. Kabloom Golden Globe. Kabloom
other TV award I can't think of right
now. Like a SAG or something.

PARKER STARR
Whatever.

RYAN
Yeah -- whatever to you.

Mathers steps in...
MATHERS
Okay ladies, calm down -- can we just
focus here. You said she was
preparing for a performance?

PARKER STARR

Yeah -- they were doing the death
scene from Baz Lurhmann's Romeo &
Juliet.

RYAN

That explains the outfits. And they
flipped gender roles to keep it
fresh. Clever. Makes perfect sense.

MATHERS
None of this makes sense. First of
all Romeo & Juliet was written by
William Shakespeare.

RYAN
Technically maybe, but Baz's was like
way better than the original. Kinda
like Ocean's Eleven.

(MORE )
16.

RYAN (cont'd)
Pre-Titanic Leo. Post-Catalano, pre-
Homeland Danes. So good. Plus, not
to make this a history lesson or
anything, but that Roland Emmerich
movie totally disproved that
Shakespeare even ever existed. So...

Mathers clenches her jaw, trying to ward off a conniption.

MATHERS
Never mind.
(to Parker)
Please, continue.

PARKER STARR
Well, they were stressed out about
it. I know because we all are. I'm
in the class too. Jared and I were
rehearsing our scene from Scream
before Mr. Hero here "saved the day"
and broke Jared's arm.

RYAN
Allegedly. FYI -- I'm not really
approaching my role as a "hero" per
se, but more of a troubled
protagonist.

PARKER STARR
That's such an obvious choice. Look,
all I'm saying is tonight's gonna be
huge. Some big time agents'
assistants are gonna be in the crowd.

RYAN
(intrigued)
Really? Like who?

MATHERS
(cutting in)
What's the class called?

PARKER STARR
It's Alfonso Diaphano's exotic scene
study and review.

MATHERS
Alfonso Diaphano? That's an actual
human being's name?

RYAN
He's only like one of the best acting
teachers east of the 405.

(MORE )
17.

RYAN (cont'd)

He was Taylor Lautner's on-set coach
for like all of the Twilight movies.
He teaches at this old school place
downtown. His class is impossible to
get in to.

(to Parker)
You must be good.

PARKER STARR
Better than you.

RYAN
(aside to Mathers)
I don't like her. I think she did
it.

MATHERS

Relax.

(to Parker)
Well, it looks for all the world like
your roommate, Jane, stabbed her
acting partner in the chest and then
swallowed some poison to off herself
in the process. Quite the little
scene stealer, wouldn't you say?

PARKER STARR
That doesn't make any sense.
(beat)
Why would she kill John on the same
day he proposed?

Ryan and Mathers share a dumbfounded look.

INT. PRECINCT / BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Ryan and Mathers exit the INTERVIEW ROOM and walk toward us
through the BULLPEN as we track with them. Ryan checks his
phone...

RYAN
She wasn't lying. Look, Jane updated
her Facebook page that morning.

JANE DOUGH's Facebook page: a picture of a modest ENGAGEMENT
RING on her hand with the tagline: He asked!!! #HappyWife.

RYAN (cont'd)
I didn't see an engagement ring on
her finger.
10

18.

MATHERS
That's because there wasn't one.

Mathers mind races. They keep walking. We keep tracking.

MATHERS (cont'd)
Still doesn't explain why his blood
was on her hands.
(beat)
We're gonna need some answers.

RYAN

Totally.
Ryan's smirking.

MATHERS
What?

RYAN
We just did our first walk and talk
together.

MATHERS
Huh?

RYAN

This whole thing was just a walk &
talk one-er. It's like a way to make
boring plot stuff less boring for the
audience. They did it all the time
on The West Wing (so good right?).
See how we just went in like a big
circle but nothing really happened--

WHACK -- Ryan walks balls-first into a BANISTER BEAM,
doubling over and dropping. Mathers doesn't break stride.

MATHERS
That just did.

INT. PRECINCT / MEDICAL EXAMINER'S ROOM - DAY 10

The two DEAD BODIES lie on STAINLESS STEEL SLABS as Ryan and
Mathers get the lowdown from PRIYA DAS (30s) a sober Indian-
American Medical Examiner. She pulls down her exam mask,
revealing a strikingly beautiful face.

PRIYA DAS
We got the lab results back an hour
go.
19.

Ryan is stunned...

RYAN

Whoa -- time out -- you're crazy hot.
PRIYA DAS

Excuse me?
RYAN

No, I mean that in a good way. Plus,
your face is like totally diverse.

PRIYA DAS
What the hell does that mean?

RYAN
I'm just saying you could play a
doctor on TV or something.

PRIYA DAS

I'm a doctor in real life.
RYAN

Yeah -- but you could be one on TV.
PRIYA DAS

Why would I want to do that?
Ryan is utterly flummoxed by that response.

RYAN
Huh?

MATHERS
I'm gonna step in here. What did the
labs tell you?

PRIYA DAS
She drank a concentrated form of a
chemical compound NaOH.

RYAN
Sodium Hydroxide.
(off Mathers look)
I played a "cool" chemistry teacher
for a three ep arc on Heart of Dixie
season five. No biggie.

PRIYA DAS
He's right. Sodium Hydroxide is the
active ingredient in Drano. Highly
corrosive. She basically chugged
acid.
20.

MATHERS
Ugly way to go. What about the blood
on her hands?

PRIYA DAS
We tested it and it isn't his and
it's not hers either.

RYAN
Oh shit -- is it alien blood?

MATHERS
Ignore him. I don't follow. You're
saying there was a third party?

MEDICAL EXAMINER
No. I'm saying it's not anyone's
blood. Because it's not blood at all.

RYAN
It's stage blood.

PRIYA DAS
Corn syrup and red food coloring.

To prove her point, Priya runs her gloved finger along the
"blood" on Jane, licking it. Ryan gags.

PRIYA DAS (cont'd)
Your partner's correct.

MATHERS
We're not partners. He's a
sanctioned civilian observer.

RYAN
I'm getting a badge.
MATHERS
No he's not.
RYAN
It's being discussed.
MATHERS
(to Priya)

I don't understand, why would she
bother with stage blood if she was
gonna stab him anyway?

Priya picks up an EVIDENCE BAG holding the KNIFE.
Mathers just

21.

PRIYA DAS
This is a prop knife. The blade is
suppose to retract on impact, but
someone blocked the mechanism inside
of it, locking it in place.

MATHERS
So this wasn't a murder-suicide.

RYAN
This was a murder-murder sitch.

stares at Ryan.

MATHERS
Seriously? What's wrong with you?

RYAN
What? I'm sorry I don't know the
fancy term, okay? It's only the
second episode. We need a technical
adviser on this show.

MATHERS
I swear to god I'm not gonna make it.
Look, Streisand, this means there's a
killer out there and we've gotta find
him.

RYAN
(proudly correcting)
Or her. It could be a her -- women
can be murderers too. They're just
as good at killing as men are.
Equality, you know? I'm with her.

Ryan shoots the camera a little "you're welcome" glance.

MATHERS
Let's go.

RYAN
Where to?

MATHERS

Whoever fixed the prop knife also
clearly replaced the fake poison in
her vial with the real stuff. And
whoever did that, had to know that
they were doing that particular scene
for the showcase -- which means the
killer is in that stupid acting
class.
22.

RYAN
Whoa -- that was awesome. You're like
the first half of A Beautiful Mind.

MATHERS
Come on, we don't have a lot of time.

RYAN
One sec...

Ryan turns to Priya...

RYAN (cont'd)
Hey Doc Bollywood, I've got some
light smile lines coming in here and
here. Can you just hit ‘em real
quick before we go.

PRIYA DAS
Are you asking me for Botox?

RYAN
Just a quick poke-er-roo with the ol'
freeze juice and we'll be on our way.
We're gonna be on the confessional
couch later and that lens can be like
super unforgiving.

MATHERS
Are you fucking serious right now?

RYAN
Oh and she could use it too. Like a
lot. Like pretty much everywhere.
Hose her down.
(stage whisper)
She's from Cleveland.

PRIYA DAS
Gross.
RYAN
Right?
11 EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER - DAY ll

Establishing. I have nothing else to say about this.

23.

INT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER - DAY 12

Mathers and Ryan talk with a scarf-wearing ALFONSO DIAPHANO
(60s) who flutters about the space getting things ready for
the big show tonight. Actors rehearse in the background.

MATHERS
Mr. Diaphano, thanks for the time, is
there anyone in the showcase tonight
that might've had a reason to dislike
Jane or John?

ALFONSO DIAPHANO
Darling -- try everyone. Jane and
John were far and away the best
actors in the class and tonight they
would've shown it by blowing all the
other performers off the stage. I
bet half of them are secretly
thrilled those two won't be going on
tonight. The spotlight, after all,
is only so big.

RYAN
So true. So true.

ALFONSO DIAPHANO
Do I know you from something?

RYAN
Probably. I'm Ryan Hansen.

ALFONSO DIAPHANO
(long beat)
Nope.
Alfonso moves on, Mathers and Ryan follow.
MATHERS
I'm sorry, you're telling me an actor
would kill another actor just for a
chance to get noticed?
Alfonso looks to Ryan confused. He explains...

RYAN
She's from Cleveland.

Alfonso makes a face like he caught a whiff of something.

MATHERS
I know, I know -- "gross".
24.

Suddenly, Alfonso gets a text message. He checks it.

ALFONSO DIAPHANO
I'm sorry. I must go. Ashton has an
on-set scene emergency. They want
him to keep his shirt on. The fools.
(beat)
Good luck finding the "killer" -- so
dramatic!

With that, Alfonso sashays off. Ryan turns to Mathers.

RYAN
Look -- there's only one way to solve
this crime and catch the killer. You
thinking what I'm thinking?

MATHERS
I can promise you I'm not.
RYAN
(jazz hands)
It's a...
13. INT. WELL-LIT SOFA - DAY 13
RYAN

...Showcase showdown!

On the Modern Family-style confessional couch, Ryan and
Mathers address the camera directly.

RYAN (cont'd)
We're going undercover at tonight's
to do. We find that engagement ring,
we find the killer. Right, partner?

MATHERS
We're not partners.

RYAN
You're right. We're not partners.
We're more important than that to
each other now. We're scene
partners.

MATHERS
This is going to be unbearable.

25.

RYAN
(excited)
I know, right? And I have the
perfect scene for us to do together.

INT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / STAGE - NIGHT 14

A HALF-FULL AUDIENCE watches Ryan and Mathers, both soaking
wet and dressed like McAdams & Gosling from The Notebook,
standing center stage. A makeshift "rain machine" offers up
a two-foot wide deluge directly over Ryan.

Mathers gives the stiffest reading imaginable, checking her
palm for cribbed lines as she goes.

MATHERS
Why didn't you write me? Why? It
wasn't over for me. I waited for you
for seven years. And now it is too
late.

Ryan chews the scenery...
RYAN
I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you
every day for a year.

Mathers misses her cue. Ryan prompts her. She reluctantly
obliges...

MATHERS
You wrote me?
RYAN
Yes. It wasn't over. It still isn't

over.
Ryan goes to pull Mathers in for the big movie star kiss
moment but she quickly pivots and hip-tosses Ryan to the
stage in a slick Judu move.
Ryan writhes. Mathers bows and gives a genuine smile,
pleased with herself. A confused crowd applauds lightly.
INT. DOWNTOWN LA THEATER / BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 15

Ryan and Mathers come off stage. Ryan is hot...

RYAN
What the hell was that?
26.

MATHERS
I'm sorry okay? It was a reaction.
I thought you were attacking me.

RYAN

Attacking you?! With my mouth?
MATHERS

How was I supposed to know -- I've

never seen the movie, okay?

RYAN
(horrified)
You've never seen The Notebook???

MATHERS
I don't like movies. I find them
hard to believe.

RYAN
I can't even with you.

Ryan moves to a WALL OF HEADSHOTS and starts pulling them
down, one after the other.

MATHERS
What the hell are you doing?

RYAN
Our job. These are all the head
shots for the actors in the showcase
tonight. On the back are their
resumes. At the bottom of every
acting resume is a little section
called, "special skills" which no one
ever reads. Except me, right now,
because whoever our killer is...

MATHERS
...-has to have a background in
Chemistry.

RYAN

I was gonna say probably studied
Meisner. But that could work too.

Mathers starts pulling off head shots too. They scan them
tossing them aside as they go. Ryan shakes his head...

RYAN (cont'd)
Seriously -- rollerblading counts?
27.

MATHERS
Hello there. Guess who minored in
Organic Chemistry at Baylor?
Mathers turns her phone to show Ryan...

RYAN
Told ya...

HARD CUT TO:
PARKER STARR,
wrapped in a robe, putting on make-up in a BACKSTAGE MIRROR.

RYAN (0.S.)
.++.women can be killers too.

Reveal Ryan and Mathers in the mirror. Parker spins.

MATHERS
Not a lot of six-foot blondes know
how to synthesize sodium hydroxide
from liquid plumber.

RYAN
And only one person in Alfonso's
class does.

MATHERS
You're under arrest, gigantor.
RYAN
Honestly -- this all feels a little

straight forward to me. I was hoping
for more of a twist ending.

On cue, a gun slides into frame pointed right at the back of
Ryan's head.

JARED (0.S.)
How's this for a twist?

Reveal: JARED, Parker's scene partner from the GoPro shoot.

RYAN
More of a reveal, but I'll take it.

Jared, sporting a cast on his broken arm, shoves Ryan and
Mathers DEEPER BACK STAGE, away from everyone, as Parker
joins his side smiling smugly.
28.

PARKER STARR
There was no way we were going to let
those two steal the show tonight.
I'm the one who got Jane into this
class in the first place.

MATHERS
So you killed your friend just for a
performance?

PARKER STARR
She wasn't my friend, she was my
competition. But that's not why I
killed her.

Parker pulls on her necklace, revealing Jane's ENGAGEMENT

RING.

PARKER STARR (cont'd)
I killed her because I was in love
with her. And if I couldn't have
her, no one could.

RYAN
Oh shit -- lesbian stuff. This is so
HBO, I love it. Plus it really
connects with our LGBTQ demo.

MATHERS
Oh I get it. You're not "actor
crazy" you're just crazy-crazy.
What's your plan, sweetheart? Kill
us both? Make it look like another
murder-suicide?

PARKER STARR
Why not? After the performance you
two gave, anyone would believe you
left the stage and immediately killed
yourselves.

RYAN
How dare you.

Ryan lunges forward -- Mathers steps in front of him,
holding him back.

Just then,

a CHUBBY DUDE dressed like Uma Thurman from Kill

Bill steps in...

KILL BILL DUDE
Parker, you guys are up next -- whoa.
16

29.

He stops short at the sight. Parker and Jared are
momentarily distracted. Mathers takes advantage -- knocking
the gun from Jared's hand.

Instantly, it's chaos -- Ryan grabs for Parker who slips out
of his grasp leaving him with a handful of terry cloth robe,
revealing herself to only be wearing skimpy black lace
undies and heels. Distracting to say the least.

Mathers pulls her gun but is flattened by the Kill Bill Dude
who Jared shoves at her, snatching up his own gun and
running toward the stage.

Parker takes off in the opposite direction, grabbing the
Kill Bill Dude's KATANA SWORD as she goes -- slamming
through a door that's marked ROOF ACCESS.

Ryan and Mathers pop up together...

RYAN
You go after him, I'll handle her.

Mathers rolls her eyes: typical.

RYAN (cont'd)
What? She's the one without a gun.

MATHERS
Just go!
The partners split up.
INT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / STAGE - MOMENTS LATER 16

Jared comes rushing out on stage interrupting a very
emotional scene from Fast and Furious (apparently Dominic
Torretto lives his life a quarter of a mile at a time).

Jared leaps from the stage and hurries down the center aisle
just as Mathers appears from behind the curtain.

MATHERS
Freeze! LAPD!

BANG!-BANG! Jared fires a couple of pot-shots before
exiting through a SIDE DOOR. Mathers dives out of the way.

The actors are confused, but crowd loves it, pulling out
their phones; filming and posing for "Peace Sign" selfies as
the action unfolds behind them.
17

18

30.

Mathers shakes her heads in disgust as she sprints past
these Los Angeles idiots...

MATHERS (cont'd)
Someone call 911!

She pounds through the side door in hot pursuit.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ROOFTOP - NIGHT 17

Ryan pushes through the ACCESS DOOR onto the roof. Steam
vents and the downtown skyline give the whole thing a lush
LA Noire vibe.

Ryan scans the rooftop, no sign of Parker. He pivots back
and suddenly ducks, barely avoiding decapitation from the
leggy blonde's home run swing -- THWACK! Steam shoots out
of a freshly severed pipe as a wild-eyed Parker steps into
her light...

PARKER STARR
You thought I was a guest star on
your show?! Wrong! You're just a
day player on mine!

She attacks, unleashing a flurry of swings as Ryan scrambles
back narrowly dodging each one.

It's an odd, albeit kinda sexy, sight as a six foot model in
five inch heels, swings a four foot sword in her underwear.

RYAN

(ducking)
Don't you think this is a little
gratuitous?

(ducking)
I mean, I can't really tell if this
is super misogynistic or like a
female empowerment thing? Can you?

Another swing sparks off of stone as Ryan jumps out of the
way.
EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ALLEY - NIGHT 18

Jared hustles toward us just as Mathers pops into the alley
from the side door. He fires at her. She dives for cover.
19

31.

He's got her pinned, but Mathers spots something. She fires
two precise shots -- clipping a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER just
above Jared's head. The heavy iron ladder comes down like a
guillotine, clonking Jared on the head. Out cold.

Mathers rushes up to him, kicking his gun away and cuffing
him to the ladder. Then she hears a GIRL SHRIEK. She looks
up to see Ryan standing on the ledge of the roof, his back
to her.

MATHERS
Shit.
She takes off running.
EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ROOFTOP - NIGHT 19

His Jordan 6's on the edge of the coping, Ryan's out of real
estate. Parker smiles...

PARKER STARR
Any last words?
(beat)
Wait -- I'm sorry, featured extras
aren't allowed to speak.

She raises her sword when suddenly...

RYAN
Wait! Wait -- okay?!

Something in Ryan's tone give Parker pause. Gone is his
glib charm, this is now something real for him...

RYAN (cont'd)
I get it. I know why you killed her.
I know what it's like to love
something that doesn't love you back.
(beat)
I've been a working actor for over a
decade, but most people confuse me
with Ryan Phillippe. And I've
finally, after all these years, got
my own show and it's not even on
television. It's on a website that
most people think they jerk off to.
(beat)
I know your pain, Parker. I'm the
same as you. We all hurt.

Moved by his words, all the fire goes out of Parker, she
lowers her sword...
32.

PARKER STARR

Thank you.
RYAN
No, thank you.
(beat)

Can I just ask you one thing?

PARKER STARR
Sure. What?

RYAN
Who's your favorite Batman?

Huh? Parker doesn't follow. Then we hear the cry...

MATHERS (0.S.)
Clooooney!

Parker spins just in time to take a crisp right cross to the
jaw from Mathers -- CLUNK. The spindly blonde goes down in
a heap of knees and elbows, one punch knock out.

Ryan looks to Mathers...

RYAN
Took you long enough.

MATHERS
I didn't want to interrupt your
monologue.

Mathers cuffs Parker, helping her to her wobbly feet.

RYAN
Case closed. Cue the sirens.

Indeed, the sound of police sirens. Parker scowls at
Ryan...

PARKER STARR
You tricked me!

RYAN
(big smile)
It's called acting, bitch. Look it
up.

Mathers drags her off. Ryan watches smugly, then...

SIRI
Your Hamilton audition starts now.
20

33.

Ryan curses, he can't believe he forgot. Devastating.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER - NIGHT 20

Flashing lights and a lovely little crane shot let us know
that we've reached the aftermath.

Parker and Jared are shoved into the back of a waiting squad
car as Mathers and Ryan walk toward us...

MATHERS
I'm sorry you missed your big
audition.

RYAN
(glum)
Thanks.

Mathers tries to buck him up...

MATHERS
Look -- it's an aftermath scene. You
love aftermath scenes.

RYAN
Yeah. I guess so.

Just then, a 22 year-old AGENT'S ASSISTANT in a suit
approaches gushing over Mathers...

AGENT'S ASSISTANT
You were incredible! "Freeze LAPD!"
Amazing! So authentic!

He hands her his card.
AGENT'S ASSISTANT (cont'd)
I work in Adam Venit's office at WME.
Call me, I can get you work tomorrow.

MATHERS
I'm not an actress. I'ma cop.

AGENT'S ASSISTANT
Method! I love it! Don't change.

He moves off. Mathers just shakes her head...
MATHERS

I think he still had his baby teeth.
You want this?
21

34.

She offers his card to Ryan who shakes his head, defeated.

RYAN
I just wanna go home.

Ryan moves off. We hold on Mathers feeling for him.

INT. RYAN'S SIT COM HOME SET - DAY 21

AMY and Ryan's THREE GIRLS sit at the kitchen table with JON
CRYER, each with multiple devices in front of them (laptops,
iPhones, iPads, etc.) tapping away feverishly. Ryan's
youngest complains...

YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
Mommy, my finger hurts.

AMY
I know, honey. Just a couple more
hours -- Daddy needs as many clicks

as possible for his show to stay on
the internet.

JON CRYER
I love this -- it's like the cutest
little sweatshop ever.

The STUDIO AUDIENCE laughs.

OLDEST DAUGHTER
Mom -- how come I haven't seen a
single ad for stuff I don't want and
can't skip on YouTube?

AMY
That's because you're not on
YouTube -- you're on YouTube Red.

YouTube's Premium Subscription
Service channel.

(to camera)
It's a bargain at only $9.99 a month.

MIDDLE DAUGHTER
Like NetFlix?

AMY
Well, they both cost the same.

OLDEST DAUGHTER
I wanna watch The Crown.
35.

AMY
Well all do, honey. Well all do.
Keep clicking.

JON CRYER
Hang on -- you guys are on YouTube
Red?
(realizing)

Well, that explains a lot.

AMY
What site have you been on this whole
time?

Amy moves to look at Jon's laptop. He quickly closes it,
standing up.

JON CRYER
A very different website with a very
similar name. But the categories
section make a lot more sense now.

The audience laughs knowingly. Cryer moves to the door just
as it opens and in walks Ryan. The audience cheers his
entrance.

YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
Daddy!

All three girls rush their father. He kneels down for a
hug. It makes him smile.

MIDDLE DAUGHTER
We've been clicking on your show to
help you stay internet famous, even
though we can't watch The Crown on
it.

OLDEST DAUGHTER
Or Stranger Things.

YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
Or Narcos.

MIDDLE DAUGHTER
Or House of Cards.

The effort melts Ryan.

RYAN
Aw -- thanks, guys.
36.

AMY
Why hello there, white Aaron Burr.
How'd the big audition go?

RYAN
It didn't. I missed it.
AMY
You missed it? Oh no -- why?

MATHERS (0.S.)
Because he was helping me solve a
case.

Mathers enters. The audience cheers. She's still not used
to it.

MATHERS
I couldn't have done it without him.

Ryan nods a thank you to Mathers.

AMY

Well, there will be other auditions.
JON CRYER

Not for Hamilton there won't.

Byeeee!
The crowd laughs as Jon Cryer scoots off waving to them.
RYAN
That's okay. I don't need Hamilton,
I've got you guys.

A big family hug. The crowd "Awwws". The hug ends. Ryan
turns to Mathers.

RYAN (cont'd)
See ya tomorrow.

MATHERS
See ya tomorrow.

Mathers goes to the door, but stops and turns back.

MATHERS (cont'd)
Hey Haircut --

Ryan turns.

MATHERS (cont'd)
Catch.
22

37.

Mathers tosses him something. He catches it. Then looks to
see it's a SHINY GOLD BADGE.

RYAN
Are you serious?

MATHERS
It's a meter maid's badge, but I
don't think anyone will notice.
(then)
See you tomorrow...scene partner.

It's a warm moment. The crowd reacts appropriately. Ryan
smiles. Mathers nods back. Jon Cryer pops back in...

JON CRYER
Does anyone know how to clear a
browser history? Asking for a friend.

The audience laughs. So does everyone on stage. FREEZE.

END OF EPISODE.

INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY 22

A VIDEO RECORDING stutters to life as Ryan steps back and
takes his mark, addressing the lens.

RYAN
Ryan Hansen, self-tape audition for
the role of Aaron Burr in Hamilton:
American Vengeance.

Ryan turns left and right, offering profiles. He squares
up, takes a breath, then lets it rip.

RYAN (cont'd)
Too bad, Alexander. When the bomb
I've strapped your chest to goes off,
your dream of an America with a
strong central government goes with
it. I guess I, Aaron Burr, am
finally in "the room where it
happens."

(then)

What? George Washington? How did
you get in here-- NOoooOo!

Suddenly, Ryan starts jerk his body all over the place as
though he were getting shot to death. In slow motion. With
sound effects.
38.

This goes on for awhile.
Ryan finally dies, pulling the backdrop sheet down with him.
Breathless, he pops back into frame.

RYAN (cont'd)
And scene.
