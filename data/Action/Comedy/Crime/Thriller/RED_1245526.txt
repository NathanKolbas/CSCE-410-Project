FADE IN:

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

FRANK MOSES lies awake in bed, waiting for the beginning
of the day. 4:59 AM changes to 5:00 and he gets up.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN

Wearing a tattered bathrobe, Frank watches his coffee
brew.

He's compact and in good shape with broad shoulders and
close-cropped hair. He could be 50s, could be 60s - he
has this grizzled quality that makes it tough to tell.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Like the rest of the house, the living room is only
nominally furnished: a sofa, lamp, and a shelf of records.

Frank cranks out a set of pushups.
Frank cranks out jumping jacks.

Frank cranks out sit-ups. Not crunches... sit-ups.

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Frank eats two eggs and dry toast at the small table.
One small frying pan, one plate, one knife, and one fork
are set in the rack to dry.

EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY

Wearing a devastatingly uncool sun hat, Frank picks a
lone weed from the dirt around his roses, then stands
back to admire them: they're withered and sickly.

He looks over sourly at the roses next door: a dazzling
array of color.

A young MOM comes out of the house with a baby ina
stroller.

MOM
Hi, Mr. Moses.

Frank puts on a smile and gives her a wave.
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

Frank contemplates a shelf full of cans of BEANS.
He starts loading up his cart - at least 50 cans.
ANOTHER AISLE

Frank loads up 50 cans of SPINACH.

CHECKOUT COUNTER

A teenage CASHIER eyes Frank as she rings him up.

CASHIER
Guess you like beans.

FRANK
They're all right.

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Frank puts his groceries away, revealing that his cabinets
are already filled with cans. He carefully places the

new ones in back, rotating his stock.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Frank goes through his mail, tossing the junk, leaving
only one letter: a green envelope. He tears it open: a
check from the U.S. Government.

Pulling an LP from a shelf of vinyl records, Frank drops
it onto the stereo and lowers the needle.

Picking up the phone, he takes a deep breath and dials.

OPERATOR (V.0.)
May I have your social?

FRANK
Five four three, six six, two two
nine one. Pension services please.
OPERATOR (V.0.)
Thank you Mr. Moses. Please hold
for your representative.

There's a series of CLICKS as the call is transferred.

INTERCUT - INT. HUGE OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Rows of cubicles stretch out beneath the fluorescent
lighting, filled with operators on headsets.
3.

SARAH ROSS, older then 30, but we won't say more than
that, sits in a cubicle spruced up with spider plants,
postcards, and pictures.

She's pretty, conservative looking, and bored.

SARAH
Hi, this is Sarah.

FRANK
Hey. It's Frank Moses.

She immediately brightens.

SARAH
Hey Frank. What's going on?

FRANK
Nothing really. I was just calling
because I didn't get my check again.

SARAH
Oh jeez. I can't believe they
haven't worked this out. I'll
make sure they get another one out
today.

FRANK
It's no big deal. Whenever you
get around to it.

SARAH
I'm just sorry this happened again.

Frank leans back, tearing up his check.

FRANK
What are you gonna do?

A pause draws out between them.

FRANK (cont'd)
Well, I guess...

SARAH
So how are your roses doing?

Frank hurriedly answers...

FRANK
It's a massacre. I've got rust
and mold. Now I've sprayed them
so much they have chemical burns.

SARAH
You try soapy water?
He lights

FRANK
That works?

SARAH
I swear. Hey what are you listening
to?

up.

FRANK
It's The Chirping Crickets; Buddy
Holly's first album in '57.

SARAH
Never heard it.

FRANK
It's before your time. Hell, it's
before my time, but it's an amazing
record. It has the first released
version of "That'll Be the Day."

She smiles.

SARAH
You have a lot of free time, don't
you?

FRANK
Little bit. Yeah.
(beat)
I don't have the foggiest idea
what to do with myself.

SARAH
What did you do before you retired?

FRANK
I was in the diplomatic corps.

This strikes a chord.

SARAH
Really? I'd give anything to travel
more.

FRANK
Believe me, it's not so fun when
it's business.

SARAH
I just want to quit my job and
move to Spain for six months.

FRANK
You should. You'd have an amazing
time.
SARAH
I can see why retirement would be
hard. Maybe what you need is to
fall in love with something new.
Frank smiles.

FRANK
Yeah. I guess so.

An annoying looking woman with a pinched face appears at
the edge of Sarah's cubicle.

SARAH
My supervisor. I gotta go.

Sarah hangs up and aggressively stares the woman down.
SARAH (cont'd)
What?
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Frank sits on the floor of the darkened room, repeatedly
bouncing a rubber ball against the wall and catching it.
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sarah sits at the table in her kitchen eating dinner alone
and reading a spy thriller.
EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
Heading inside, Frank sorts through his mail. Two pieces
of junk and another green envelope. He smiles.
INT. HUGE OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Sarah's on her headset.
SARAH
You need excitement. A passion.
Something that makes you feel alive.
INTERCUT - INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - LATER
Frank dumps a can of spinach into a pot.

FRANK
Excitement is overrated.
SARAH
How can you say that? Everyone
needs excitement. The most I get
is fighting with my mother.

FRANK
What about?

SARAH
She keeps trying to set me up on
blind dates with her bridge
partners' kids. She just told me
she's worried I'm gay.
(suddenly concerned)
I'm not, by the way.

FRANK
Good to know.

SARAH
I think we need to talk about
something else.

Frank can't help but grin.

FRANK

What are you reading this week?
SARAH

Just a romance.
FRANK

What?
SARAH

It doesn't matter.
FRANK

(teasing)

Come on.
There's a long guilty beat.

SARAH
It's called Love's Savage Secret.

Frank mulls this over.

FRANK
Is it good?

SARAH
It's terrible! I love it! The
lead is a sort of a Britney/Lindsay
character marooned on this island
with her tennis pro and a prince.
FRANK
Who's Britney Lindsay?

SARAH
Very funny.

Frank was serious, but lets it go.
FRANK
Hey, hold on a second, I want you
to hear this.

He carefully puts on a record and drops the needle. Buddy
Holly's THAT'LL BE THE DAY echoes out.

They both listen.

SARAH
I like this.

FRANK
It's cool, right?

SARAH
Yeah.

They listen for another minute.

SARAH (cont'd)
I better be getting back to work.

FRANK
Yeah, course. I didn't mean to
keep you.

SARAH
I'm glad you did. I'll talk to
you soon?

FRANK
You bet.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Frank sits reading Love's Savage Secret, biting his lip
as he turns the pages.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Frank climbs into bed and turns out the light.

The clock changes from 10:59 to 11:00. He lies in the
darkness, staring up at the ceiling, waiting to get tired.

THAT'LL BE THE DAY, fades to a close.
BUDDY HOLLY (V.0.)
That'll be the day-ay-ay that I
die.
EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The house is quiet and still against the suburban night.

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frank lies on his bed, staring at the ceiling.

It's 3:22.

He picks up the glass beside his bed, but it's empty.
Getting up, he shrugs into his tattered bathrobe.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

Frank shuffles out of his bedroom and down the hall to
the bathroom.

But as he passes the stairs, the CAMERA HOLDS on the
darkness of the stairwell...

...and the darkness suddenly comes alive with motion: THREE
COMMANDOS in hi-tech body armor, night-vision, and weaponry
are right there.

From a small case, the leader takes out a full syringe.

The second reaches past him with a snoop scope linked to
his heads up display: the hall is clear, the door at the
far end swinging closed.

They move silently into the hall, listening to the WATER
RUN: the leader with the syringe, the second empty-handed,
ready for the take down, the third with a machine pistol.
The bathroom door stands ajar, spilling out bright light.

The commandos lift their night-vision as they move down
the hall, past the guest room, closing in.

WHAM! They kick in the door revealing...
...the empty bathroom...

...as Frank steps out of the darkened guest room behind
them in his robe and bare feet.

The three men whip around, startled...

WHAP! The commando closest to Frank goes down.
9.

The second swings, but his legs are swept from under him,
Frank's heel crushing his throat as he hits the floor.

The leader lunges with the syringe, but it's twisted out
of his hand and suddenly in his arm... plunger pressed.

Staring at Frank, the commando's eyes flutter and drop.

Frank is left standing alone amidst the bodies. He isn't
even breathing hard.

He crouches down, looking them over without emotion.

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Frank grabs a sledge hammer at the bottom of the stairs,
steps to the middle of the room and swings.

CRACK! A thin layer of cement shatters.
Sweeping fragments away, he pulls out a buried locker.
Inside are bricks of cash and an array of passports.

Frank quickly stuffs a satchel. Then he unwraps an old
1911 model .45 semiautomatic and adds it as well.

Finally he grabs an old set of miliary dog tags and puts
them in his pocket.

INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frank finishes dressing, picks up the phone, and dials.

OPERATOR (V.0.)
May I have your social?

FRANK
Five four three, six six, two two
nine one. Status RED.
He hangs up and heads out.
But the phone RINGS.
He stops, listening to it ECHOING EERILY through the house.
Finally he picks it up, holding it to his ear, waiting.

VOICE (V.0.)
Frank Moses?

Without answering, Frank moves beside the window, up
against the wall, slightly pulling back the drapes and
glancing out.
10.
A white van is parked at an odd angle across the street,
the back door open.
EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
POV from inside the van: WE SEE the bit of curtain move.
CLICK: Suddenly it's the same view IN INFRARED, Frank's
heat signature clear as day.
INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Frank catches a glint of light from the van.

Exploding into motion, he drops the phone and runs all
out down the hall as...

PFFT! PFFT! PFFT! Three 40mm grenades are launched
into the house and...

BOOM! A fireball roars down the hall as...

Frank SMASHES through a second floor window...

EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

.. hits the roof, and spills into the yard in a shower of
glass.

EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Stepping from the back of the van, a FOURTH COMMANDO slings
his six-round grenade launcher and raises binoculars,
surveying the destruction.

Catching a glimpse of motion he lowers the lenses...
...Frank is twenty feet away, charging straight at him...

The commando scrambles for his sidearm but... WHAM!
...-he's tackled straight back into the van.

The rear doors are pulled closed, the engine starts, and
the van pulls out, disappearing in to the night.

EXT. BOSTON SUBURB - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

SUPERED TITLE: SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS

Boston rises in the distance behind this cute suburb by
the Charles River.
11.
EXT. SARAH'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah heads up the walk with a guy a full head shorter
than she is.

SARAH
I had a nice time tonight. Thank
you.

FRED watches her unlock the door.

FRED

Aren't you going to invite me in?
SARAH

Sorry Fred. Say hi to your mom

for me.

INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kicking off her shoes, Sarah slides out of her dress and
pulls on an oversized shirt already laid out on a chair
beside Love's Savage Secret.

Settling in, she cracks the book, but then thinks again
and gets up.

Walking into the kitchen, she grabs a glass, ice, and a
pour of bourbon. Then she shakes her head...

SARAH
Fred.

...and pours a little more.
Heading back to her book, she passes Frank.
Shrieking, she jumps, the glass smashing on the floor.

Sarah grabs a vase to defend herself as Frank puts up his
hands.

FRANK
Hey! Hey! It's Frank Moses.
SARAH
Stay back!
FRANK
It's me.
(beat)

You eat Tasty Cakes for lunch and
your mom thinks you're gay.

She stares, worlds colliding, her fear turning to anger.
12.

SARAH
Jesus Christ!

She protectively pulls down her shirt to cover more of
herself, backing away.

SARAH (cont'd)
What the hell are you doing here?

Frank steps forward, hands still up.

FRANK
You have to get out of the house.

SARAH
What are you talking about?

FRANK
It's not safe here. It's my fault
and I'll explain, but right now, I
need you to come with me.
She stares at him nervously.

SARAH
I think you'd better leave.

He picks up a small suitcase from the floor.

SARAH (cont'd)
That's my bag.

FRANK
I packed for you.

She looks around, reeling.

SARAH
Did you... do my dishes?

Frank's clearly guilty.
Pulling it together, she puts on an authoritative tone.
SARAH
Frank. I always liked you. But
I'm not about to...
Sarah freezes in fear as he draws his .45.

But he's staring past her out the window, where a car
pulls up across the street.

FRANK
Right now, out the back.
13.

SARAH
I'm not going anywhere!

Frank's torn, feeling the seconds ticking by, not sure
how to handle this.

FRANK
I was never a diplomat. I was in
the CIA, and someone is trying to
kill me. That means there's been
surveillance. They've listened to
our phone calls and they're going
to come after you as leverage.

SARAH
I'm calling the police.

The car doors open and three men get out, crossing the
street toward Sarah's.

INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

Frank's behind the wheel with Sarah's purse on his lap,
going through it as he smoothly drives, tossing a nail
file and her can of pepper spray out the window.

FRANK

This couldn't be more different

from how I hoped to meet you, you

know, if we ever even did meet.

He comes up with her cell phone and tosses it out too.

FRANK (cont'd)

But things happen and I think it's

important to be flexible.

He pauses, taking a breath, knowing it's not going well,
but really trying.

FRANK (cont'd)
You know what I mean?

Frank glances back for reassurance.

REVEAL Sarah, tied and gagged in the back seat, staring
daggers at him.

EXT. BEST BET ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

As dawn breaks, Frank pulls into this quiet, anonymous
ranch-style motel.
14.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Sarah sits on the bed watching Frank warily as he unties
her wrists then reaches for the tape on her mouth.

FRANK
Sorry.
He RIPS it off.
SARAH
Ow!
FRANK

You want some water?
She looks at him, scared but in control.

SARAH
If you let me go right now, I won't
press charges.

FRANK
I'm not kidnapping you.

SARAH
What do you think you just did!

FRANK
You were in danger.

SARAH
No I wasn't! Even if you aren't
completely full of crap and people
are after you, no one cares about

me.
FRANK
They know I call you. They've
listened.
SARAH
So what?

Frank can't quite look at her, embarrassed.

SARAH (cont'd)
What?

; FRANK
(dying)
They know... I like you.
She isn't sure how to respond.

SARAH
You hardly know me.
15.

FRANK
I know you.

She looks away.

SARAH
If you're really CIA, why don't
you just call them?

FRANK
I don't know how these guys found
me.
(beat)
I have to see someone. I need you
to stay here until I get back.

SARAH
You just want me to sit here?

FRANK
You'll be perfectly safe. No one
knows where you are.

He picks up the tape and tears off a fresh piece. She
looks at him in confusion and fear.

FRANK (cont'd)
I'll be back soon.

She realizes what's about to happen.
SARAH
No! You crazy kidnapping pervert
sonofabitch. You can kiss my...

Frank tapes her mouth.

INT. EXPENSIVE HIGH RISE CONDO - HOME OFFICE - DAY
SUPERED TITLE: PHILADELPHIA

WILLIAM COOPER, 30s, sits at a desk, tearing open a manilla
envelope with latex gloves.

He wears a conservative suit and tie, but his haircut and
bearing are those of a soldier.

Pulling out several 8x10 black and white photos, he drops
them on the desk: they're of a man and woman in a tryst.

BATHROOM

Cooper takes out a sheet of plastic with a dozen blonde
hairs pressed onto it.
16.

Lifting them one by one with tweezers, he places them on
a brush, in the shower drain, in the dust on the floor.

As his phone VIBRATES, he checks the number and answers.

COOPER
Hey hon.

He takes out plastic sheets with individual fingerprints
pressed into them.

Laying one on the corner of the mirror, he peels back the
plastic, leaving the print.

COOPER (cont'd)
No I think I'll be on time tonight.

KITCHEN
Cooper walks past someone struggling to maintain his
precarious tip-toe balance on a chair, his hands secured
behind his back and his neck in a noose.
COOPER (cont'd)

Okay, well I'll talk to the boys

about it when I get home.
BEDROOM

Cooper lays fingerprints on the left side of the bed and
nightstand.

COOPER (cont'd)
I will. I promise.

KITCHEN
Cooper walks back in.

COOPER (cont'd)
Okay. Love you. Bye.

Desperate, the MAN from the tryst photos tries to look
down at Cooper while keeping balanced. He's 50s, heavyset
but well groomed, wearing a suit that cost thousands.

MAN
(Eastern European accent)
Listen. I can make you rich.
Cooper ignores him, making a note on his PDA.
MAN (cont'd)
YOU DON'T IGNORE ME! DON'T YOU
KNOW WHO I AM?

Cooper glances up with no reaction.
17.
COOPER
Actually, I don't have the slightest
idea.
He kicks the chair out from under him.

Legs dance wildly in the air behind Cooper as his phone
buzzes again. He checks the text: "FRANKLIN SQ. 10 MIN."

The legs still. Cooper removes the padded restraints
from the wrists of the dead man and heads out.

EXT. GREEN SPRINGS ASSISTED LIVING - DAY - ESTABLISHING

At least that's the sign. But there's no green. Just
cracked pink stucco as far as the eye can see.

SUPERED TITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C.

INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY

JOE MATHESON sits in a wheelchair in his small one-room
apartment, struggling to reach the rabbit ears of a tiny
crap TV.

Joe's a man from another era - 90s and frail - but his
white hair is neatly parted and slicked back, and he wears
a three-piece suit with a gold chain and pocket-watch.

Smacking the side of the television, he shakes it, making
a hell of a racket until...

NURSE
Is that thing acting up again?

Joe glances back and smiles at the cute NURSE in his
doorway.

JOE
Yeah. Can you give it a shot Marna?

MARNA
Of course.

He rolls out of her way and settles in to watch as she's
forced to lean way over to reach the antennas.

MARNA (cont'd)
I don't see why you don't move
these lower.

He admires her ass.
18.

JOE
Better picture. Try a little to
the left.
(beat)
That's getting there.

REVEAL Frank stepping into the doorway, taking in the
scene. He clears his throat.

Joe looks over as the nurse straightens up.

MARNA
Well, I think that does it Mr.
Matheson.

She walks out, placing a hand on Joe's arm as she passes.

MARNA (cont'd)
See you later.

JOE
Thanks Marna.

Frank watches her go, marveling.

FRANK
You're unbelievable.

Joe grins devilishly, struggling to his feet and pulling
Frank into a huge hug.

JOE
Your timing is terrible, Kid. I
don't see you in forever and when
you finally show, you're cutting
into my action.

FRANK
Is that why you're always telling
me not to come?

Frank helps him sit back down.
JOE

It's goddamned embarrassing you
seeing me like this.

FRANK
Who do you think you're talking
to, Joe?

JOE

I never thought it would happen to
me. Getting old. The things we
did, I never thought I'd still be
alive. Hell, I can't believe you're
alive.
19.

FRANK
Yeah, well, I retired.

JOE
You? Ha! Can't be. I remember
recruiting this wet-behind-the-ears
army punk like it was yesterday.

Frank can't help but smile.
JOE (cont'd)
What'd you do? Marry the girl
next door?

Frank hesitates.

INSERT - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Sarah lies on the bed, mouth taped, hands and feet tied
to the bed frame, furiously struggling to get loose.

RETURN TO SCENE

FRANK
Not exactly.
(beat)
I got a visit from a wet team last
night.

JOE
(stunned)
Jesus. How'd that go?
FRANK
You have someone you trust in the
Company who can run some IDs?

JOE
Sure. Got the prints?

Frank tosses him a squishy plastic bag.
Joe peers inside, disgusted.
JOE (cont'd)
You know there was a time this was
a gentleman's game.
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - FRANKLIN SQUARE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

Moms walk babies, a pack of kids kicks around a soccer
ball, and parents casually watch the action.
20.

Cooper walks along the edge of the game, stopping beside
a heavy, balding MAN, 50s, in a conservative suit holding
a newspaper.

They both watch the soccer game.

MAN
We had an action go south. I need
you to clean it up.

He hands Cooper the newspaper.

MAN (cont'd)
This is from the top. It's off
the books. Total blackout. No
logs. No records. Are we clear?

COOPER
Yes sir.

Cooper opens the newspaper, revealing a file. The first
page is a long-lensed photograph of Frank watering his
roses.
MAN
That's your primary target. There
was a previous team. They are dead.
Cooper flips through the file, reading.

COOPER
He was CIA.

MAN
Is that a problem?

Cooper closes the file and tucks the paper under his arm.
COOPER
No.
EXT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY

Joe and Frank sit on a small patio in the shade. Joe's
on a cell phone taking notes.

JOE
Okay. You too. Thanks.

He hangs up.

JOE (cont'd)
It was a South African team. Very
elite. They only worked for major
governments.
Joe gives

FRANK
Christ.

him a hard look.

JOE
What the hell did you do?

FRANK
Nothing! I'm out! I've been
sitting on my ass killing roses.

JOE
One of them is also a print match
to an NYPD crime scene. A woman
was killed a couple months back.

his notes to Frank, but nothing clicks.

FRANK
I don't know her.
___(angry)
This doesn't make any sense. Who
would come after me now?

JOE
Give me a day. I'll make some
calls. See what I can find out.

FRANK
Just be careful. These guys are
motivated.

JOE
(laughing)
Hell, Kid. I'm ninety years old
with stage IV liver cancer. What
do I have to be afraid of?

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

This cramped high-tech nerve center is filled with

computers,

data and video feeds.

THOMAS and JACKSON, 30, cold and hard, stand with Cooper,
sorting through the detritus of Frank's life spread out
on tables: phone bills, mail, trash, receipts...

JACKSON
In six months this guy didn't make
a single personal phone call. No
credit cards, no voicemail, no
computer, no TV.
22.

COOPER
Run the ten pay phones closest to
his house.

A phone RINGS and Thomas grabs it.

THOMAS
Yeah?
(to Cooper)
D.C. Metro's responding to a 911
call from one Sarah Ross.

EXT. BEST BET ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY - ESTABLISHING

Three police cruisers and an ambulance are out front,
lights flashing.

POLICE OFFICERS have cordoned off the area.

EXT. AMBULANCE - DAY

Sarah sits on the tailgate being checked out by a PARAMEDIC
as a YOUNG COP stands protectively beside her. She's
stressed out and shaken.

SARAH
I need to call my family.

PARAMEDIC
Just finishing up.

He strips the blood pressure cuff and the cop helps her up.

YOUNG COP
We'll get you a phone, but they
want me to take you downtown for a
statement. There's also a bunch
of federal guys who want to talk

to you.
SARAH
Is this going to take long?
He grins.
YOUNG COP
Definitely.

EXT. STREET - DAY
Sarah follows the cop around the corner to his cruiser.

VOICE (0.S.)
Hey!
23.
An older, PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE, approaches.

PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE
Where are you taking her?

YOUNG COP
(confused)
What do you mean?
INSERT - EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks down from the rooftop, watching the two cops
through binoculars.

COOPER
(into headset)
Take him out.
RETURN TO SCENE

The detective's startled as, PFFT! PFFT! he takes two in
the chest from a SILENCED PISTOL in the young cop's hand.

Stunned, Sarah backs away, but he grabs her, jabbing a
hypodermic into her arm.

SARAH
No!

He pops the trunk of the cruiser, forcing her inside...
...but suddenly the cop's grabbed from behind.

CRUNCH! He falls...

...revealing Frank.

Sarah woozily stares at him and then the two dead bodies.

SARAH (cont'd)
You just killed that man?

FRANK
Yes.

He pulls open the syringe and tastes what's inside.

SARAH
Am I going to die?

FRANK
Just sleep. You probably need it.

He helps her into the passenger side of the cruiser.
24.

SARAH
I am very tired.

Sliding behind the wheel he pulls out.

Sarah leans against him, watching the world slide by with
heavy lids.

SARAH (cont'd)
Frank?

FRANK
Yes.

SARAH
This is just like in Love's Savage
Secret, where the tennis pro saves
her from the Jihadists.

...and she's out.

WHAM! A SEDAN SLAMS INTO THE SIDE OF FRANK'S CAR AT 40
MPH SENDING BOTH CARS SPINNING IN A SHOWER OF GLASS.

Opening his door for cover, Cooper's unloading rounds
into Frank's police cruiser.

But as he whips out his magazine and reloads, Frank pops
back up behind the wheel, peeling out in shriek of burning
rubber and twisted metal.

Cooper tracks the cruiser, FIRING until it disappears
around a corner.
INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS
Driving with one hand, Frank's on the radio.
FRANK

Shots fired! Officer down! sth

and Douglas! Suspect is a white

male, 30's, dark suit, white

shirt...
INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Back in the car, Cooper punches it, peeling around the
corner after Frank, accelerating fast, but then abruptly
SCREECHING to a stop.
Frank's cruiser is parked on the street.

Jumping from his car, gun ready, Cooper approaches, angling
around to see inside... it's empty.
25.

Taking his time, Cooper surveys the scene: Frank's car
hissing coolant; a dead-empty street of small businesses.

Whipping up his gun at motion, Cooper looks down his sights
at a CLERK in the flower shop in front of him, staring at
him in wide-eyed fear through the open door.

On both sides of Cooper, police cars turn onto the street,
screeching to a halt 100 feet back and spilling out cops.

CoP
Drop your weapon!

Cooper weighs his options. Then he puts down the gun and
raises his hands.
INT. FLORIST SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Stepping into sight with Sarah unconscious in one arm,
Frank moves his .45 from the clerk to cover Cooper.

The two men stare each other down.
FRANK
(to the clerk)
Out the back. Car keys. Now.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - JOE'S ROOM - DAY

Joe Matheson's on the phone, worried, jotting something
on a piece of paper.

JOE
I appreciate it. Okay. Bye.

He folds the paper and scrawls Frank's name on it.

Rolling to his dressing table, Joe straightens his tie,
combs his hair back, and picks up his wallet and keys.

Behind him, the door to his room opens and two men in
suits step inside, pulling the door shut.

Joe coldly eyes them in the mirror, slipping the paper
into the dresser. One SUIT takes out a gun. The other
picks up a pillow.

JOE
So it's like that then?

SUIT
Yeah. It's like that.

Joe nods, resigned.

INT. CAR - BROOKLYN - DAY
SUPERED TITLE: BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
Frank sits in an SUV parked in front of an apartment
building, sipping coffee. Across the river are the
skyscrapers of Manhattan.
Sarah stirs, waking in the passenger seat beside him.

FRANK
Hey.

She looks around, disoriented and panicky.

FRANK (cont'd)
Take it easy. You're okay.

Off balance, she tries to calm down.

SARAH
How...
(beat)
How long was I asleep?

FRANK
About six hours. Coffee?

She nervously looks him over and takes it.
SARAH
Thanks.
(beat)
Thanks for saving me.
He nods. She takes a sip.

FRANK
How'd you get free?

SARAH
I worked the headboard loose and
burned through the rope with the
heater's pilot light.
Frank's impressed.

SARAH (cont'd)
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

FRANK
I'm sorry I tied you up.

A beat.

SARAH
Who's doing this?
27.

FRANK
I don't know.

She's having trouble grasping it all.
SARAH
I'm supposed to have dinner with
my parents tonight.
FRANK
You're not going to make it. And
if you call them, they're going to
get hurt. Do you understand?
She nods, unnerved by his intensity.

SARAH
What happens now?

FRANK
The men who came after me killed
the daughter of a woman who lives
in that building. I'm hoping we
can figure out the connection.
She considers this.
SARAH
I guess you're going to be stuck
with me for a while.
Frank looks at her in surprise.

FRANK
Yeah.

Sarah absently picks a piece of car safety glass out of
her hair and looks questioningly at Frank.

He shrugs.

INT. NICE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Frank and Sarah stop at number 2D.

FRANK
One sec.

He opens his satchel and grabs the duct tape.

FRANK (cont'd)
Hold this.

Then he takes out a drug bottle and fills a syringe,
tapping out the bubbles.
28.

SARAH
What are you doing? I thought we
were going to talk to her!

FRANK
We are. This'll just help.

SARAH
The woman lost her daughter!

She grabs the syringe.

SARAH (cont'd)
People are basically nice, Frank.

She knocks on the door. He looks at her sourly.

FRANK
That hasn't been my experience.

SARAH
I think maybe I should do the
talking.

INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Sarah and Frank sit on the sofa opposite MRS. CHAN, 60,
who hands Sarah a photo of her smiling 30ish daughter.

MRS. CHAN
She gave me this picture the week
before she died. It was the last
time I saw her... The police said
it was just a burglary.

Sarah puts a sympathetic hand on her arm.
SARAH
We don't know it was anything other
than that. You said Stephanie was
a reporter?
Mrs. Chan nods, choked up.

SARAH (cont'd)
Do you know what she was working on?

MRS. CHAN
No.

Sarah notices writing on the back of the photo: a cross
followed by 1980 1745 126.

SARAH
What's this number?
29.

MRS. CHAN
I don't know. It's Stephanie's
writing. I tried dialing it. The
police had no idea.

Frank stares at the numbers.
EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
Frank and Sarah walk through the foyer.

FRANK
It's a dead drop. That code is a
call number for a book.

SARAH
Call numbers start with letters.

FRANK
Library of Congress does. Harvard-
Yenching is a system for Asian
language books. 1980 is the number
for Christian literature: the cross.

SARAH
How could you possibly know that?

FRANK
Wo zhu zai Zhongguo ji nian qian.

SARAH
Christ. You speak Chinese?

FRANK
I was there for a few years.

INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - STACKS - DAY

Studying call numbers, Frank pulls a book from the shelf,
and opens it. Inside is a single sheet of paper: a typed
list of almost twenty names.

SARAH
Unbelievable.

One of them is "FRANK MOSES."

SARAH (cont'd)
What is this?

FRANK
I don't know.
30.
INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - COMPUTERS - DAY
Sarah sits at a terminal with the list between them.

SARAH
Hank Maestriano... died two weeks
ago in a car crash. Daniel McGinty,
heart attack last week. Aaron
Burke... suicide four days ago.

FRANK
Jesus. It's a hit list.

Pulling out a cell phone, he quickly dials.

SARAH
This one guy is still alive, I
think. Gabriel Loeb. He flies
cargo planes.

FRANK
(into phone)
Who is this?
(pause)
Marna? Where's Joe?

INTERCUT - INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

Joe's nurse MARNA stands shaken and stammering. Behind
her, Joe's apartment is swarming with cops.

MARNA
Mr. Moses?

FRANK
What happened?

MARNA
Mr. Matheson has disappeared.
There's... there's blood everywhere.

She silently breaks down.

DETECTIVE (0.S.)
Looks like two shooters...

Frank's reeling.

FRANK
No...

MARNA
They found a note with your name
on it. He talked about you all
the time. He loved you like a
son.
31.

FRANK
Marna. What did it say?
MARNA
It was just two words.

(beat)
The Company.

Frank hangs up, stunned. He's beside himself.

FRANK
Joe's dead.

She reaches out to him, but he gets up. He's cold with
fury, stirred to the core of his being.

FRANK (cont'd)
Those bastards are going to pay.

SARAH
Who?
INT. CIA - LANGLEY VIRGINIA - DAY
SUPERED TITLE: CIA HEADQUARTERS, LANGLEY, VA

Striding across the seal of the Central Intelligence Agency
set into the polished marble floor...

...is Cooper.

INT. CIA - SECURE RECORDS DEPOSITORY - DAY

Cooper stands with Frank's file across from a RESEARCH
CLERK at a computer.

COOPER
This man is NOT a retired Asian
block analyst who's been out of
the field for thirty years.

RESEARCH CLERK
That's what it says.
INT. CIA - VAULT - DAY

Two guards check Cooper's paperwork, then nod to an old
RECORDS KEEPER.

The old man dials in a combination and the guards swing
open a huge steel door, revealing a cavernous file room.
32.
RECORDS KEEPER
These records have never been
computerized. They never will be.
EXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
SUPERED TITLE: DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Frank moves through the throngs of people exiting the
terminal, accidentally bumping into a woman in the crowd.

FRANK
Excuse me.

Pressing on, he flips through the pocketbook of the woman
he just bumped.

Reaching Sarah in line at the ticket counter, he hands
her a driver's license that looks remarkably like her.

FRANK (cont'd)
Cynthia Bolt. Memorize the date

of birth.

SARAH
Will you tell me where we're going
now?

FRANK

To see Marvin.
Confused, Sarah takes out the list, finding the name.

SARAH
Marvin Frye?

FRANK
He's the only name on that list I
know. We worked together before
he sectioned out. He knows things.

SARAH
Frank, he died two years ago ina
fire.
FRANK
He's died before.
SARAH
What does that mean?
FRANK
Marvin's... peculiar. Extremely

paranoid and dangerous. He's not
like other people.
33.

SARAH
You're not like other people.

Frank considers. It's a fair point.
FRANK
Right. Well, Marvin's less like
other people.
A TICKET AGENT waves them over.
TICKET AGENT
I'm sorry things are so slow, our
computers are down. Someone spilled
coffee on the server.
Frank takes the last sip of a jumbo java.
FRANK
No kidding.
INT. CIA - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Cooper drops a six-inch-thick stack of paper stamped "TOP-
SECRET" onto the table.

COOPER
Frank Moses's real file.

Thomas flips it open.
Page after page has been blacked out, line by line.

JACKSON
Is this a joke?

They finally get to bits of text here and there:
"VIETNAM... MOSCOW... BEIRUT... IRAN... NICARAGUA."

COOPER
This guy's got to be one of the
best black ops agent we ever had.
He's offed drug-lords, terrorists,
heads of state. He's toppled
governments.

"REGIME CHANGE... TERMINATED... ELIMINATED..."

JACKSON
Jesus.

An ALARM from one of the computers sends Thomas back to
check his system.
34.

THOMAS
I've got a ticket to Rio on Sarah
Ross's credit card. They've been
in the air three hours.

COOPER
Three hours?
THOMAS
It looks like someone um... destroyed

the airline's airport server.
Cooper digests this, pissed.

JACKSON
He's running.

COOPER
He's not running.

THOMAS
He knows we're going to be hard
pressed to have someone there before
him.

COOPER

Does this look like the file of
someone who's going to rabbit?
It's a dodge.

(beat)
I get this guy. He's good. But
he's old school. Cloak and dagger
crap. He hardly knows how to use
a computer.

THOMAS
He knows how to wreck one.

Cooper shoots him a hard look, thinking it over.
COOPER
If we hurt the woman's parents, do
you think it will draw him out?
This catches Thomas off guard.

THOMAS
I... don't know.

COOPER
Put them under surveillance.
EXT. SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY - ESTABLISHING
SUPERED TITLE: SAN DIEGO

Frank and Sarah exit a terminal.

SARAH
Car rental?

FRANK
Long term parking.
EXT. LONG TERM PARKING - DAY

Frank and Sarah step into the street in the "LONG TERM
PARKING" lot.

A GUY in a JEEP screeches to a halt and HONKS.

GUY
Move it!

SARAH
We're in a crosswalk!

The guy leans on his HORN and REVS his engine.

Sarah jumps out of the way, but Frank just stands there,
looking over the Jeep and its mullet-sporting driver.

GUY
Chop chop, Grandpa!

Frank steps to the driver's side window.

GUY (cont'd)
What? You wanna go?

FRANK
Is this thing 4-wheel drive?

GUY
Hell yeah.

INSERT

Frank slams the trunk of a parked car on the duct-taped
guy, climbs into the JEEP, smiles at Sarah and pulls out.
EXT. BORDER CROSSING - DRIVING - DAY

Heading south, Frank and Sarah are waved through to Mexico.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

Bouncing along this dirt road with the sun setting behind
them, it feels a million miles from anywhere.
36.
Up ahead, a walled compound rises out of the desert mesa.
FRANK
When we get there, don't make any
sudden movements. Don't ask to
use a phone. In fact, don't even
talk about phones. Or satellites.
Sarah stares at him.

SARAH
You're serious?

FRANK
Yeah, why?

Driving up to the front gate, they pull to a stop.
FRANK (cont'd)
(calling out)
Hello?

A little Mexican kid appears, pulling open the gate and
excitedly waving them into the courtyard.

Frank pulls forward...

...and suddenly the ground gives way and the entire Jeep
collapses into a pit trap.

Frank's instantly out the roof of the car, jumping clear...
...but as he hits the ground a FIGURE IN DESERT CAMO bursts

from a spider hole, leveling an assault rifle at Frank's
head, screaming...

MARVIN

WHO ARE YOU?
FRANK

Jesus, Marvin! It's Frank!
MARVIN

WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
FRANK

I'm not!
MARVIN

You are!

As Marvin's finger tightens on the trigger Frank lashes
out, pulling the barrel past him and the fight is on.

Marvin throws two quick punches, connecting hard, but
Frank counters, sweeping a leg, and they land in a heap
with Frank's .45 in Marvin's face.
37.

FRANK
WHY DO YOU THINK I AM TRYING TO
KILL YOU?

MARVIN

Because the last time we met, I
tried to kill you.

Frank considers.

FRANK
That was a long time ago.

MARVIN
You sure? Some people hold onto a
thing like that.

FRANK
I am NOT trying to kill you!

Marvin thinks it over and smiles.

MARVIN
Okay.

FRANK
So get your knife out of my balls!

REVEAL Marvin has a blade pressed to Frank's crotch.
They slowly lower their weapons.

Marvin helps Frank up, dusting him off. He's older than
Frank, weathered, with wild hair and bright eyes.

Reaching into the pit, Frank helps Sarah out of the car.
FRANK (cont'd)
Sarah, this is Marvin Frye. Marvin,
she's okay. I promise.

SARAH
Hello.

Marvin eyes her with suspicion, then abruptly turns and
starts out the front gate, walking into the desert.

MARVIN
Come on. I'll show you the house.

Frank glances back at the beautiful hacienda behind them.

FRANK
What's that?

Marvin doesn't even turn around.
38.

MARVIN
The decoy.

INT. BUNKER - DAY

A door in the ceiling opens and harsh sunlight breaks the
darkness, revealing stairs running down cast concrete walls.

Marvin, Sarah and Frank make their way into the utilitarian
bunker, past barrels of water and fuel, MREs and dry goods.

SARAH
Why do you live in a bunker when
you have that other place?

MARVIN
I moved out last year after that
helicopter flew by.
(leaning close)
I could feel their eyes on me,
wet, like peaches.

Sarah glances wide-eyed at Frank, but he waves her off
with a "don't go there" gesture.

Marvin leads them into the "living room," smiling genially.

MARVIN (cont'd)
So let me see this list.

Frank hands it over as Sarah glances around uneasily at
the ratty chairs and dozens of racks of firearms, crates
of C-4, grenade launchers, and Stinger missiles.

FRANK
Everyone on it's dead except for
us and one other guy. I can't
figure out the connection.

Marvin paces as he studies the list, growing more and
more agitated.

MARVIN
I always told you, Frank, you can't
trust the system. You can't be a
part of it, because then, the minute
they flip the switch, you're done.
The satellites, man, the cell
phones, the chips, the net...

Marvin drifts off, staring at nothing.
Frank and Sarah exchange a look worried look.

FRANK
Marvin.
39.

MARVIN
What?

FRANK
The list. I need your help.

Marvin looks at him, then back at the list, completely
unaware of any break in continuity.

MARVIN
Let me check the files.

INT. BUNKER - FILE ROOM - DAY

A steel door CREAKS open revealing a room that looks like
the physical embodiment of a madman's mind.

Towers of papers, clippings, scrawled notes, and typed
summaries fill the room, floor to ceiling, flagged with
color codes and numbers in some insane indexing system.

FRANK
It's gotten bigger.

MARVIN
This may take a minute.

INT. BUNKER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Frank walks back in. Sarah chases after him, eyeing the
aluminum foil taped to the bunker's ceiling.

SARAH
(whisper )
Frank. This guy's insane!

FRANK
I told you: he sectioned out.

SARAH
How am I supposed to know what
that means?

FRANK
Trust me, Marvin's the guy you
want watching your back when
everything goes to hell.

SARAH
He said he tried to kill you!

FRANK
I always felt bad about that.
SARAH
What?

FRANK
He thought he was the subject of a
secret government mind control
experiment. I told him he was
nuts. He thought I was in on it
and tried to kill me.

SARAH
Jesus.

FRANK
Yeah, but later I found out they
were actually dosing him with LSD
for a decade.

Marvin walks back in with a stack of papers,
Sarah.

MARVIN
Afghanistan. Fall of '81 near
Ghazni. At least four of these
guys were there, not including us.

Frank thinks back, remembering. He looks at

SARAH
What was it?

Two Mujahideen fighters walk along a rocky path into a

narrow valley.

On closer view, we see it's Frank and Marvin.

MARVIN
Holy Christ.

FRANK (V.0.)
It was a village.

Bloodied bodies lie everywhere. Men. Women.

Animals.

They stop

Children.
41.
Flies BUZZ obscenely.
FRANK (V.0.) (cont'd)
There were no military targets
there. It was a massacre.

Marvin examines a spent shell and tosses it to Frank.
They exchange a concerned look.

Stepping over bodies, they approach Special Forces CAPTAIN
McGINTY waiting for them beside a CIVILIAN, 30s, who
incongruously wears a short-sleeved button-down.

MARVIN
What the hell happened here?

But the civilian steps in front of him.
CIVILIAN
Your orders are to make this
disappear. Bury the bodies. Burn
everything else. Pick up every
piece of American brass. This
never happened.

Frank just stares at the carnage.

INT. BUNKER - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Frank stares at Marvin.
FRANK
You think everyone on this list
was involved?
Marvin shrugs, flipping through military records.
SARAH
Even if there was some massacre,
why do they want to kill you now?

MARVIN
You sure it's the CIA?

Frank nods.
Marvin paces, getting more and more worked up.

MARVIN (cont'd)
Dammit. DAMMIT!

Well we've got to do something.

SARAH
Gabriel Loeb.

MARVIN
Lock and load, baby! It's on!

EXT. BUS STATION - DAY

Loud cars, thick pollution, and crowds of locals selling
trinkets to crowds of American tourists fill the street.

SUPERED TITLE: JUAREZ, MEXICO

Frank and

Marvin sit in the shade, eating popsicles and

watching Sarah talk on a pay phone across the street.

MARVIN

(agitated)
What if they've tapped every data
source that exists on this Loeb
guy and are backtracing every
connection that comes in on those
sources and somehow filter those
millions of calls and know it's us
and then tag us with a chemical
marker, or put a satellite on us,
or fry us with Y-rays?

Frank thinks it over.

FRANK
Even for you that's pretty paranoid.
43.

MARVIN
I guess.

Marvin glances up at the sky, then pulls out a tattered
napkin and makes some urgent notes.

FRANK
What are you doing?

MARVIN
(defensive)
Nothing.

Sarah hangs up and heads over.

MARVIN (cont'd)
What's with the girl, anyway?

FRANK
I like her.

MARVIN
No seriously. What's the angle?

Frank lets it go as Sarah walks up.
SARAH
Loeb is coming into San Antonio.
We can meet him at the Air Freight
terminal. It's his first return
to the country in four weeks.
Marvin looks at Frank.

MARVIN
How do you want to cross the border?

FRANK
Discreetly.
EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN ANTONIO - BUS TERMINAL - DAY
SUPERED TITLE: SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

A group of noisy SENIOR TOURISTS carrying tons of cheap
Juarez tourist crap disembark from a tour bus.

Among them are Frank, wearing a serape, Sarah with a pig
pifiata, and Marvin sporting a sombrero.

A drunk OLD LADY swigs from a beer, singing at Marvin...
OLD LADY

La cucaracha, la cucaracha, ya no
puede caminar...

MARVIN
Next time lets just hijack someone
or blow something up.

SARAH
Next time I get the serape.

FRANK
I always get the serape.

MARVIN
He does.

Walking away, Frank and Sarah head to a taxi stand and
look around for a cab.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
Oh no! Oh God! Please don't...

Frank and Sarah spin, stunned to see...

Marvin, holding a gun to the head of a BUSINESSWOMAN,
dragging her into an alley.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

MARVIN
WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

BUSINESSWOMAN
(terrified)
Coldwell Banker! I'ma real estate
agent! Just take the money. Please
don't hurt me!

Furious at the lie, Marvin cocks the pistol, putting it
to her eye, sending the woman erupting into tears as Frank
and Sarah burst around the corner.

SARAH
Hey!
FRANK
Marvin! What are you...
MARVIN
SHE'S ONE OF THEM!
FRANK
One of who?
MARVIN

SHE WAS FOLLOWING US, MAN! She's

got a camera hidden in her purse.
(matter of fact)

We have to kill her.
45.
WOMAN
(sobbing)
No... please...
Marvin holds up his left hand to block the splatter...

SARAH
Frank!

FRANK
Just hold on!

He grabs the woman's purse and dumps the contents onto
the ground: there's a wallet, cosmetics, a cell phone.

Frank rips the purse apart: there's nothing.
FRANK (cont'd)
(annoyed)
Where's the camera, Marvin?
Marvin hesitates, suddenly unsure.

MARVIN
She was... following us.

Frank pushes down the barrel of Marvin's gun and snaps
the woman's cell phone in half.

FRANK
(to the woman)
Go.
She runs off. Frank gives Marvin a hard look.
FRANK (cont'd)
Go get us a car. And don't kill
anyone.
EXT. AIR CARGO TERMINAL - DAY

Sarah and Frank watch a 747 cargo jet pull to a stop on
the tarmac and power down.

Marvin's in the background with the pifiata, absentmindedly
scratching it behind the ears.

Sarah's quiet. Angry.

FRANK
Are you upset?

SARAH
"She's got a camera hidden in her
purse. We have to kill her." Are

you kidding me?
46.

FRANK
Everyone makes mistakes.

He stands, cutting off Sarah's retort as three PILOTS
enter the terminal.

FRANK (cont'd)
Gabriel Loeb?

The oldest pilot looks over. He's Frank's age with that
classic ex-military look: tight haircut, thin, good shape.

The other two pilots pause as well, but Gabriel nods to
them to go on ahead.

FRANK (cont'd)
You have a minute?

GABRIEL
(Texas twang)
What's this about?

FRANK
Afghanistan. 1981. Near Ghazni.

There's a tense beat.

GABRIEL
I can't talk to you.

He pushes past, but Marvin steps in front of him.
In a flash, Gabriel has a knife in his hand.
Marvin and Frank both draw guns.

Gabriel smiles.

GABRIEL (cont'd)
Pair beats ace.

INT. AIR CARGO OFFICE - DAY

They walk Gabriel into this second story windowed office
looking out over the airfield. Marvin circles the room,
looking out the windows.

GABRIEL
You fellas hear the one about what
the West Texas Jew-boy twice-
decorated Marine pilot said to the
Chinese New York Times reporter?

FRANK
What?
47.

GABRIEL
Nothing! I didn't tell her a damned
thing!

Frank looks at him coldly.

FRANK
She's dead. And everyone on her
list is dead except for you, me,
and him. The CIA has targeted
everyone who was there.

Gabriel's stunned.

GABRIEL
Oh Christ.

Frank stares at him realizing...

FRANK
You know why...

Gabriel sits down heavily, unable to look at him.

FRANK (cont'd)
Tell me.

He glances up with fear and resignation.

GABRIEL
They had me fly this guy out there
from the gulf. Middle of the night.
Hairy little airstrip in the middle
of nowhere. He picked up a package
and we flew back out.

FRANK
Who was the guy?

Over by the windows, Marvin starts MUTTERING as he fidgets
with his tattered napkin. Sarah glances over nervously.

GABRIEL
CIA. Dorky little spook in short
sleeves straight out of some office.
The whole thing was super hush hush.

FRANK
What about the package?

MARVIN (0.S.)
Frank! Frank! Frank

FRANK
(annoyed)
What?
48.

Marvin runs over, pointing out the window.

MARVIN
A helicopter!

SARAH
We're at an airport for Christ's
sake.

MARVIN

Two four seven seven one. It's
following us. I write down all
the numbers, see?

Frank stares at Marvin, then looks at the tattered napkin,
filled with dozens of rows of tiny, smeared numbers.

He squints at the chopper then back at the napkin.

FRANK
That's a four.

MARVIN
It's a seven!

FRANK

Who makes a seven like that?

GABRIEL
Let me see it.

Suddenly the window SPIDERWEBS.
Sarah looks around, startled.

SARAH
Whoa! What was...?

She realizes Frank, Marvin and Gabriel are on the floor.
Frank pulls her down as...

WHUMP! A bullet hits the wall where she was standing.
Gabriel lies motionless, blood on his shirt.

SARAH (cont'd)
Oh my God!

Frank checks him. Dead.

MARVIN
I knew we shouldn't have used that
phone!

FRANK

Shut up, Marvin!

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
Frank, Sarah and Marvin burst into this warehouse alley.

Suddenly someone steps around the corner up ahead with an
assault rifle, firing.

It's the "businesswoman" Marvin grabbed earlier.
They dive behind a dumpster, bullets SLAMMING all around.

BUSINESSWOMAN (0.S.)
I'm going to fuck you up, old man!

Marvin gives Frank a look.

MARVIN
Can I kill her now?

Together as one, they swing around opposite sides of the
dumpster to fire...

But she's gone.

FRANK
Move!

Marvin covers the rear as Frank pushes Sarah up the alley.
50.

EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly their flight is interrupted as BULLETS RAIN DOWN
from a ROOFTOP SHOOTER, sending all three diving for cover
behind a scissor lift.

FRANK
(re: pifiata)
Give me the pig.

Sarah hands it over and... WHACK! Frank punches in the
side, pulling out extra magazines.

Marvin reaches in, coming up with a machine pistol.

MARVIN
Old man? I'm in my prime!

Frank scoffs.

Pissed, Marvin jacks a cartridge out of his gun, catches
it in the air and holds it out.

MARVIN (cont'd)
Bet you can't take this bullet out
of my hand.
More bullets SLAM around them.

FRANK
Not now, Marvin!

MARVIN
Bet you can't.

Quick as a flash, Sarah grabs the bullet.

SARAH
Can we go now!

Marvin is stunned.

MARVIN
WAIT! I wasn't ready. Do it again.

Under a barrage of lead, Frank leans around the scissor
lift, takes his time, and fires a single shot, ending the
incoming fire.

Suddenly BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets fly out of the wall,
beside them, just missing.

Stunned, Frank and Marvin FIRE BACK THROUGH THE WALL.

VOICE (0.S.)
Aaaagh!
51.

FRANK
How the hell...?

MARVIN
Satellites.

He looks up at the sky and flips it off.

INT. CIA - OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper watches the big screen which has up a satellite
picture of the area with red thermal signatures of the
people on the ground, including Marvin and his finger.

THOMAS
Two men down.

Jackson sees something on screen.
JACKSON
Hold on, this is going to be good.
EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

At the far end of the alley, the "businesswoman" steps
around the corner with a shoulder-mounted rocket.

SARAH
That's not good.

Frank grabs her, running all-out down the alley.
FFFSST! KABOOM! The scissor-lift explodes like a toy.
Frank and Sarah are thrown to the ground by the blast.

Reloading, the woman levels the launcher again at the
prone figures.

But suddenly Marvin steps from the burning debris, standing
his ground, facing her down like a gunfighter.

The woman's finger tightens on the trigger...

And in a single clean motion, Marvin raises his pistol
and fires.

KA-BOOOM! A massive explosion rocks the alley as his
bullet detonates the rocket.

As debris rains down on Frank and Sarah, a figure appears
above them. It's Marvin, reaching down to help them up.

MARVIN
Old man, my ass.
52.
INT. CIA - OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Everyone stares at the big screen, washed out by the
thermals and smoke.

JACKSON
I can't see anything.

COOPER

Get someone in there. I want to

see bodies.
EXT. AIRPORT SERVICE ROAD - DAY
A food service truck drives away from the airport as a
string of emergency vehicles speeds the other direction.
EXT. FOOD SERVICE TRUCK - RURAL HIGHWAY - DUSK
Marvin sleeps in the cab as Frank stands with Sarah at

the side of the road, holding back her hair as she throws
up in the tall grass.

FRANK
I told you excitement was overrated.
(beat )
You okay?

She nods, then hurls again.
FRANK (cont'd)
It happens to everybody in the
beginning.

Frank looks over at Marvin who cracks one eye and taps
his watch impatiently.

Frank shrugs helplessly.
Finally Sarah straightens up.
SARAH
You sure know how to show a girl a
good time. Are all your first
dates like this?
Frank's a deer in the headlights.

FRANK
I uh... haven't dated much.

SARAH
I don't believe it.
53.
INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - NIGHT

Frank sits beside Marvin, who chuckles to himself as they
roll through the night.

FRANK
What's that?

MARVIN
(mimicking Frank)
I uh... haven't dated much.
Frank glares at him.

FRANK
Don't make me shoot you.

Marvin is positively gleeful.

MARVIN

It's okay, man. She likes you.
FRANK

You think?
MARVIN

Notice how she's sticking around.
Women don't do that if they don't
like you.

FRANK
She doesn't have a lot of choice.

MARVIN
Sure she does.

Frank glances up at the far end of the car, watching Sarah
enter and make her way towards them.

MARVIN (cont'd)
They know we know about the list
now. They're going to keep coming.

Frank considers.

FRANK
There's only one way we're going
to find out what this is really
about.

Marvin weighs it.
MARVIN

It's impossible. We'll get killed
for sure.
54.

FRANK
So you're in?

MARVIN
Of course I'm in. I was just
saying.

Arriving beside Frank and Marvin, Sarah hands out candy
to the fellas. She looks between them.

SARAH
What?

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
SUPERED TITLE: WASHINGTON, D.C.

INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Frank's behind the wheel, Sarah's in front, and Marvin's
in back as they roll past the mall.

FRANK
If we're going to pull this off,
we're going to need help.

SARAH
Pull what off?

Frank stops across from a large compound. Marvin freaks.

MARVIN
No way! Not them!

SARAH
Who?

Marvin jumps out of the car. Resigned, Frank gets out.
Sarah follows and sees the sign: RUSSIAN FEDERATION EMBASSY.

MARVIN
Godless bastards!

He runs off down the street.

SARAH
What's happening?

FRANK
Marvin tends to be ruled by his
emotions, but sometimes you need
to think outside the box.

SARAH
You're not really going in there?
55.

Frank takes out his .45 and the dog tags he retrieved
from his basement.

FRANK
Hold these.
(beat)
In case I don't come back.
She stares at him stunned.
Frank presses them into her hands.

For a long moment neither of them moves. Then Frank turns
away, starting up the street.

SARAH (0.S.)
Hey.

He turns back and she's right there.
Reaching up on tiptoes, she gives him a kiss on the cheek.

SARAH (cont'd)
Be careful.

He looks at her for a long beat, then turns, walking past
the main gates, stopping at an unmarked steel door.

Pressing an intercom button, he looks up at the camera.
FRANK
Tell Ivan Siderov that Frank Moses
is here to see him.
There's no response.
Up the street, Sarah stands in the shadows watching.

Suddenly the door bursts open and four soldiers are
leveling AK-47s at Frank.

They expertly force him to kneel, pat him down, then
roughly drag him inside.

The last soldier stands in the doorway, rifle aimed at
Sarah. She stands frozen, unable to breathe...

...and then he's gone.

INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

IVAN SIDEROV, a rumpled old man, sits behind a large desk
wearing a permanent expression of Russian pain and
dissatisfaction, along with an expensively tailored suit
that still manages to look like it doesn't fit.
56.

Cleaning his nails, he doesn't even look up as Frank is
dragged into the room and stuffed into a chair across
from him.

IVAN
Leave us.

The soldiers look at him in surprise.

He doesn't repeat himself, but raises his eyes to them
and they file out.

IVAN (cont'd)
(heavy Russian accent)
I have to say, this is not something
I expected when I got up this morning.

Ivan pulls a vodka bottle from a drawer, pours two, and
slides one across the desk. He raises his glass.

IVAN (cont'd)
It is good to meet you. In person.

They clink and drink.

FRANK
Do you kind of want to shoot me?

Ivan smiles.

IVAN
Little bit. I used to dream about
it. Like I dream about good coffee
or sunshine during winter. But
now, what's the point? You are
retired, yes?

FRANK
Yes.
Ivan looks off.
IVAN
Still, I feel I owe you for killing
Semyon.
FRANK
The Butcher?
IVAN

A great asset. Did you know he
was my cousin?

FRANK
(a beat)
No.
57.
IVAN
(raising his glass)
To Semyon the Butcher.
Frank toasts and drinks. Then...

FRANK
He's not actually dead.

Ivan stares at Frank.

FRANK (cont'd)
I flipped him.

IVAN
No...

FRANK
Now he owns a bunch of 7-11s.

Ivan looks at him, stunned. Frank smiles.

IVAN
Bastard.

FRANK
Yeah, well, I'm sure you've heard
worse.

Ivan fills Frank's glass.

IVAN
I pour you double.

FRANK
Why's that?

IVAN

Veronique: that girl in Paris in
"81. She was mine.

FRANK
Impossible.

IVAN
Da!

FRANK
No.

IVAN
Yes!

He thinks it over.
FRANK

Whatever she got, it was worth it.
58.
They raise glasses and drink again. Ivan sits back.

IVAN
I miss the old days. We could
swing at each other like men. Now
it's economic leverage and political
posturing. I haven't had someone
killed in years.

Frank nods in sympathy.

FRANK
What can you do?

IVAN
And don't get me started on the
puppies they send me to train now:
too smart for their own good without
a gram of sense among them.

Ivan fills the glasses again.

IVAN (cont'd)
So.
(beat )
I think that you are not here for
the hospitality.

There's a pregnant beat.
FRANK
I'm going to break into the CIA.
I need your complete security
package on Langley: plans,
schedules, cracks, IDs, all of it.
Ivan stares at him.
IVAN
Why would you possibly think I
have that sort of information?
There's a tense beat.
Then they both chuckle.

IVAN (cont'd)
Why do this?

FRANK
Personal project. Like a hobby.

A beat.

IVAN
Have you tried gardening?
59.

FRANK
Didn't work out.

IVAN
I can't stand it either. If it's
not bugs, it's the damned fungus.

FRANK
You try soapy water?

IVAN
Does that work?

FRANK
So I hear.

EXT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

Sarah paces back and forth in the shadows across the street
from the main gate, alone, sick with worry.

She starts towards the Embassy, but then stops, changes
her mind, and doubles back.

FRANK (0.S.)
I told you everything was going to
be all right.
She whips around as he appears from the shadows.
SARAH
No you didn't! You said, "Hold
these in case I don't come back."

FRANK
So you were worried about me?

Now she's embarrassed. She punches him in the arm.

SARAH
Jerk.

Frank smiles.
FRANK
Let's go find Marvin.
EXT. LANGLEY VIRGINIA - CIA HQ - ESTABLISHING - DAY
Nestled on lush grounds, the old CIA headquarters building
stands flanked by the two new massive six-story buildings
where thousands of people come to work each day.

The sprawling compound looks more like a college campus
than the epicenter of American foreign intelligence.
60.
EXT. CIA - DAY

A towncar pulls up. Marvin gets out and opens the door
for Frank and Sarah, who exit wearing suits and CIA badges.

As the two of them walk toward one of the towers, Sarah
looks like she's going to be sick.

SARAH
I can't do this.

FRANK
Just relax and smile. I'll get us
inside, you'll just pull their files.

SARAH
I'm not a hacker.

FRANK
It's a closed system. The trick
is getting to the terminal.

INT. LOBBY - DAY

Frank and Sarah enter and make their way through the huge
four-story atrium, towards the high-security elevators.

An armed guard looks them over. Sarah forces a smile.

SARAH
What makes you think the Russians
wouldn't sell you down the river?

FRANK
Ivan and I come from a world where
enemies can still have ethics. I
guess you could say, I have faith.

SARAH
Faith?

Frank hands Sarah a small case and punches the elevator
button.

FRANK
Actually it's more like hope.
INT. HIGH-SECURITY ELEVATOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Stepping inside, Frank punches in a security code and the
button for the 5th floor.

The door slides closed and the wall-mounted retinal scanner
lights up as Sarah opens the case, removing a single gold
contact lens, laser-etched with an elaborate pattern.
61.
Frank bends close and she puts the contact...

SARAH
I dropped it.

Frank looks at her stunned.

FRANK
What?

SARAH
I dropped it!

ELEVATOR (V.0.)
Scan incomplete.

They both drop to the floor, frantically searching.

FRANK
Gently.

SARAH
Dammit...

ELEVATOR (V.0.)
Scan incomplete.

FRANK
I don't know how long...

An ALARM suddenly sounds.

SARAH
Oh God, oh God...

The doors roll open and THREE SECURITY OFFICERS stand
ready, hands on their weapons, looking down at Frank and
Sarah on all fours.

There's a seriously awkward beat.

SARAH (cont'd)
The General dropped his contact.

Frank looks at her in disbelief.

SARAH (cont'd)
(annoyed)
Well? Aren't you going to give
him a hand?

Frank watches stunned as the security officers quickly
join them on all fours, searching the floor.

SECURITY OFFICER
Got it!
62.
He holds up the contact to the light, looking closely...
...but Sarah snatches it.

SARAH
Here, sir.

Quickly cleaning it, she gently lays it in Frank's eye.

The lead security officer turns a key in the elevator,
and Frank leans forward to have his eye scanned.

ELEVATOR
Scan complete.

The lights go green.

LEAD SECURITY OFFICER
Have a good day, sir.

Frank nods and the doors roll closed.
FRANK

I don't begin to know what to say
about that.

INT. 5TH FLOOR - HALL - DAY

Frank leads Sarah to a heavy steel door with an elaborate
electronic number pad/scanner beside it.

SARAH
Is this it?

Frank nods.

FRANK
Did you know these locks cost eighty-
five thousand dollars each?

SARAH
No.

He pulls out a matt knife and cuts a hole in the drywall
beside the door, then reaches in and opens the handle.

FRANK
God love forced low-bid government
contracts.

He tapes a single sheet of paper over the hole in the
wall: "SECURITY IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESS."

Pushing open the door reveals a small, high-tech room
with a lone computer terminal.
63.
INT. SECURE SERVER - DAY

Sarah sits at the computer with Frank behind her, watching
her fly through files and directories.

SARAH
What do you think the punishment
is for what we're doing?
FRANK
Depending on what they charge you
with, either life in prison or death.

SARAH
Awesome.

She brings up the profile for the killer dressed as a
young cop who tried to grab her at the motel.

SARAH (cont'd)
There.

FRANK
Work the assignment tree back and
see if you can find the executive.

A few keystrokes later, she brings up Cooper's photograph
and profile.

FRANK (cont'd)
I want everything on this guy.
INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Thomas stares at his computer, flipping out.
THOMAS
Someone's tripping flags in the
system. They're all over our
players!
Cooper's at his side in a second.

COOPER
Who is it?

Thomas looks from his screen in confusion...

THOMAS
It's internal. Directorate on five.

Cooper hustles across the room and grabs a phone.

COOPER
We have a breach on five.
64.
INT. 5TH FLOOR - HALL - DAY
BOOM! SIX TACTICAL BADASSES in body armor burst into the

secure server room leveling weapons. Sarah whips around...

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
BOOM! Frank kicks open the door, bursting inside.

Thomas makes it to his feet before his face is bounced
into the desk and he hits the floor unconscious.

Frank looks at Cooper across the room, still on the phone.

FRANK
You.

Cooper stares. He almost laughs.

COOPER
Unbelievable.

Frank closes in on him.

FRANK
What did they pull out of
Afghanistan?

COOPER
(incredulous)
You think you can just walk in
here and everyone'll just roll
over?

FRANK
Actually, I figured I'd have to
beat it out of some snot-nosed
button-pusher.
Frank swings on him, but Cooper blocks and counters.
In a flurry of fists, Frank is hit once and then again.
Face bloodied, he stumbles back, stunned. Cooper smiles.

COOPER
Not quite as fast as you once were?

Frank spits blood.

FRANK
Kordesky trained you?

COOPER
Yeah.
65.

Cooper closes again, attacks, blocks, and delivers two
more brutal body-blows...

...but suddenly Frank spins around him, catching an arm
and slamming Cooper onto a desk, pinned.

FRANK
I taught Kordesky.

Frank brutally twists his arm, tighter.

COOPER
AAAAGH!

FRANK
Who ordered these hits?

Cooper glares back at him.

COOPER
Orders come, you execute. You of
all people should know how it works.

CRACK! Frank breaks his arm.

COOPER (cont'd)
AAAAAAAAAGH !

FRANK
You come after one of your own and
you don't even ask why?

COOPER
It doesn't come to me unless it's
been vetted all the way up the
line. There's not a doubt in my
mind you've earned what you've got
coming.

Frank grabs his chin, cranking his neck to the edge of
breaking.

FRANK
The minute you learned who I was
you should have walked away.

Gasping, Cooper wrenches out a reply.

COOPER
Would you?

Suddenly wrenching to his left, Cooper slides off the
desk, hitting the floor, catching Frank by surprise with
a kick, knocking him down.

Jumping up, Cooper grabs a phone with his good arm,
clobbering Frank...
66.

...but Frank kicks him, catching Cooper in the gut, sending
him flying backwards through the glass wall of his office.

Frank's up in a second, but Cooper's in his desk, coming
up with a gun.

Frank ducks, running for the door as Cooper UNLOADS.
Rounds chew up the wall behind him...

then slam into him, spilling Frank out the door.
Cooper races after, bursting into the hall...

But it's empty except for a spatter of blood.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Frank's hit in the shoulder and the side, in pain, forcing
himself down the stairs.

Stepping into the 4th floor hall, he pulls the first fire
alarm he sees.

As ALARMS RING, he presses forward through the rapidly
filling corridor and catches a woman by the arm:

FRANK
Where's the server room?

WOMAN
End of the hall.
(seeing the blood)
My God...

But he's already in motion.

INT. SERVER ROOM - DAY

Rows of servers fill this clean room, but Frank ignores
them, arriving at the "FIRE CONTROL ROOM" off to one side.
INT. FIRE CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Opening the door reveals a small room filled with gas
cylinders marked "HALON" surrounded by warning signs.

INT. 2ND FLOOR HALL - DAY

As ALARMS CONTINUE TO RING, Sarah is frog-marched by two

tactical badasses down this hall, hands zip-cuffed behind
her back.
67.

Rounding a corner, they are suddenly right in front of
Frank standing beside a Halon canister with a fire axe.

Frank takes a deep breath and swings, snapping the valve.
PRESSURIZED GAS ERUPTS and suddenly Sarah and her escorts
are writhing on the ground gasping for air that doesn't
seem to be there.

Frank wades in, cuts Sarah's zip cuffs and picks her up.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY
Frank drags Sarah up the stairs.
FRANK
Breathe out then in. You're fine.
Just breathe.
Gasping, she follows his directions, gaining control.

SARAH
You're bleeding!

FRANK
Do you have the download?

She pulls a memory stick from her bra.

INT. THIRD FLOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS

They emerge into the open hall overlooking the four story
atrium where ALARMS continue to RING.

Dozens of people fill the hall trying to figure out what's
happening as emergency vehicles pull up out front.

Security is everywhere. They're screwed.

SARAH
What are we going to do?

Frank leads her forward to where he's stashed a second
canister of Halon.

SARAH (cont'd)
What is that?

FRANK
It binds up oxygen in the air.

Kicking it over he gets it rolling and...

SMASH! The canister breaks through the glass panel under
the railing, falls three stories and...
68.
POOF !

Suddenly everyone is gasping and screaming, choking,
flipping out.

She looks at him in horror.
FRANK (cont'd)
Relax. It's just uncomfortable;
feels like nerve gas.
EXT. CIA - DAY - ESTABLISHING

Cooper stands outside the HQ buildings, scanning faces as
people stream out, desperately searching for Frank.

But PULLING BACK reveals there are THOUSANDS of workers
flooding from the buildings. It's hopeless.

EXT. VISITOR PARKING - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Frank and Sarah separate from the crowd, Frank leaning
heavily on Sarah as they make their way towards the towncar
at the back of the lot.

Marvin's behind the wheel, ramrod stiff, sunglasses on,
staring straight ahead.

SARAH
Marvin, help me.

But Marvin doesn't move.

Getting closer, they see he's handcuffed to the steering
wheel with a gun pressed to the back of his head.

FRANK
Hold up!

The back window rolls down revealing...
...JOE MATHESON. Frank can't believe it.

FRANK (cont'd)
Joe!

JOE
(nods at Marvin)
There's something wrong with this
guy, Frank, you know, in the head.

Frank grins.
69.
FRANK
Yeah. I know.
(beat)
You okay, Marvin?

MARVIN
I don't want to talk about it.

JOE
Help him in here, honey.

Sarah pulls open the door and settles Frank into the car
beside Joe.

FRANK
I thought you were dead.

INSERT FLASHBACK - INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY
Joe kicks his wheelchair around to face the two killers.

They're astonished to see he's got a 9mm semiautomatic in
each hand.

RETURN TO SCENE
JOE
Nah. Just retired.
(to Marvin)
Start the car, nutjob.

Sarah closes the door and rounds the car heading for the
front seat.

JOE (cont'd)
She's with you?

Frank nods.

JOE (cont'd)
Nice work.

Sarah slides in and Marvin pulls out.

INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, GARY STEVENS, storms down the
hall trailed by several AIDES and a SECURITY DETAIL.

He's the man from the park who gave Cooper his assignment,
but now he seems overwhelmed to the point of breaking.

AIDE #1
They don't know how he did it yet.
We're in lockdown.
70.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Are we safe?

AIDE #1
They don't believe he's still on
site.

AIDE #2

(to Aide #1)
I have the Director of National
Intelligence calling for the
Director of Operations.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
I'll call back. Wait here.

Leaving the entourage, he pushes through a door into...

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Debris is strewn everywhere. Cooper, arm splinted, gets
up to face Stevens.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
How the fuck did this happen? Do
you understand the ramifications
of this breach? How this makes us
look? The attention this attracts?

COOPER
Sir...

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Shut up. You just got your high-
tech ass handed to you by your
target. A retiree with zero
resources. A man deemed too old
to work in the field.

Cooper's phone RINGS. He kills it.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS (cont'd)
I am NOT about to get hung out to
dry. Do I need to get involved?
Get someone else?

COOPER
No sir.

Cooper's phone RINGS again and is silenced.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
I want this guy dead. I don't
care if it's messy. Take whatever
assets you need and finish it.
71.

He turns and leaves.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Cooper stalks down the hall, furious. His phone RINGS
again and he picks up.

COOPER
Cooper.

FRANK (V.0.)
You must be talking to someone
important.

Cooper goes cold.
FRANK (V.0.) (cont'd)
I was just calling to let you know
there's a new list. And you're
right at the top.

CLICK. The line goes dead.

INT. TOWN CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS
Frank closes the phone.

MARVIN
Psyops! Hell yeah.

JOE
Both hands on the wheel, Nutjob.

Sarah turns to Joe.

SARAH
The bleeding won't stop. We need
to get help.
Joe looks at Frank.
FRANK

I know a place.

EXT. EAGLE'S NEST INN - DAY - ESTABLISHING

They pull up outside this cute little B&B on the Maryland
coast with gorgeous ocean views and a stunning garden.
72.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

FRANK
I'll go in alone, see if we can
stay.

SARAH

Don't be ridiculous. I'1l go.
Joe puts a hand on her arm.
SARAH (cont'd)
(realizing)
Is this a thing? This is a thing
isn't it? Everybody knows but me?

FRANK
It'll be fine.

Frank and Marvin exchange a look.

MARVIN
You want a vest?

FRANK
Wouldn't make any difference.

INT. EAGLE'S NEST INN - DAY
Frank enters, the bell on the door JINGLING brightly.
The place is adorable.

VICTORIA sits in the dining room folding napkins. A little
older than Frank, she's prim, proper, and beautiful.

She looks up, surprised. Then smiles.
VICTORIA
(English accent)
Frank Moses.

FRANK
Victoria.

VICTORIA
It's been a long time.

FRANK
Yeah.

There's a beat between them.

VICTORIA
Are you here to kill me?
73.

FRANK
No. I need your help.

He slowly opens his jacket, revealing no weapons, but a
lot of blood.

She sighs, possibly disappointed...

VICTORIA
Oh.

...and sets aside the HIGH CAPACITY MACHINE PISTOL she
was concealing behind the stack of napkins.

VICTORIA (cont'd)
Come on in, then. And tell Marvin
to stand down before he gets hurt.

Frank glances out the window where Marvin sits in her
rose bushes covering the action.

FRANK
By the way, your roses are fabulous.

INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY
The others filter in and Joe and Victoria embrace.

VICTORIA
Joseph.

JOE
Victoria. You're lovely as ever.

VICTORIA
You old snake charmer.

Sarah looks between them all, a little lost.

SARAH
So. How do you all know each other?

JOE
Victoria was the best wet asset I
ever worked with. A true artist
with a PSG.

Sarah shoots Frank a questioning look.
FRANK
(aside)
Killer. Very dangerous.

Sarah smiles at Victoria, uneasy. She smiles back, warmly.
74.

MARVIN
I'm gonna scout the perimeter.

VICTORIA
Just mind the daisies.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER

Frank and Victoria sit alone as she peers through reading
glasses, expertly working on Frank's shoulder with forceps
and a sponge.

VICTORIA
I'd better hurry this along or
I'll be late with four o'clock
tea.

Frank studies her, impressed.

FRANK
How did you do it?

VICTORIA
What?

FRANK

Make the transition? You have a
beautiful place here. A nice quiet
life. You seem so at ease.

He winces as Victoria extracts the bullet.

VICTORIA
I try. But it's not easy.
Sometimes I get restless.
(confessing)
I still take the occasional contract
on the side.

FRANK
You do?

VICTORIA
(hesitates, guilty)
I can't seem to stop. I miss the
rush. They retire us, but you
can't just flip a switch and become
someone else, you know.

She starts stitching up Frank's shoulder.

FRANK
I didn't know what to do with
myself. All I ever had was work.
(more)
75.

FRANK (cont'd)
And suddenly there was so much
time.
(beat)
I've done so many terrible things.

VICTORIA
We did them for good reasons.

A beat.

FRANK
Maybe. I'm starting to wonder.

VICTORIA
Tell me about Sarah.

Frank looks uncomfortable: much more so then when she was
pulling lead out of him.

FRANK
She makes me feel like maybe I
could have a different life. Like
normal people.

Victoria smiles.
VICTORIA

It's one of the reasons I've always
been so fond of you, Francis: you're

a romantic.
FRANK
What?
VICTORIA
Hard on the outside. Gooey on the
inside.
FRANK

Get outta here.

VICTORIA
Gooey.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marvin, Joe, Frank, Sarah and Victoria sit around the
coffee table with papers and a laptop. Other guests chat
quietly in the background.

SARAH
This is the reporter's list. This
is the hit list we downloaded from
the CIA.

(more)
76.

SARAH (cont'd)
They're the same except there's
one name that's not on the hit
dist: Andrew Dunning.

JOE

Christ. He's CEO of Browning-Orvis.
FRANK

Who?
JOE

The defense contractor. Very
politically connected.

MARVIN
Let's pay him a visit.

Victoria pours more coffee.
VICTORIA
You know, business is a little
slow right now...

Frank smiles wide.

INT. COOPER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Cooper sits in his suburban living room, reading Frank's
file as his wife, ELIZABETH, walks in, dressed for bed.

ELIZABETH
What are you working on?

COOPER
Just trying to figure someone out.
My arm hurts too much to sleep
anyway.

ELIZABETH
I hope you learned your lesson
playing basketball with those
Marines.
Cooper gets up and gives her a kiss.

COOPER
Yes dear.

She swats him and he pushes her back towards their room.

COOPER (cont'd)
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

Halfway down the back hall, he pauses at a door, silently
cracking it open.
77.
INSERT - BOYS' ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

He looks in on his two boys, asleep in a bunk bed, each
wearing different superhero pajamas.

Cooper silently closes the door.

INT. EAGLE'S NEST INN - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
Sarah stands on the balcony, looking out at the water.

In the room behind her, Frank's cleaning his .45, but she
can feel his eyes on her.

SARAH
Penny for your thoughts?

FRANK
I was just wondering how you're
holding up. TI know it's a lot.

Sarah smiles.

SARAH
I've never been so scared in my
life as today. But it was
unbelievable. I'm okay.

He nods, then goes back to work reassembling the gun.
She watches him for a moment.
SARAH (cont'd)
Why don't you walk away? You could
disappear, right?
Frank finishes what he's doing and puts the gun down.

FRANK
Hide and go set up somewhere else?

She nods.

FRANK (cont'd)
Dragging you along on this, I think
about it. But letting this happen,
then and now, I can't.

She comes inside, picking up the cot that has been wedged
into the room and moving it along one wall.

SARAH
I think you should sleep in the
bed tonight.
78.

FRANK
Don't be silly.
SARAH
That's not what I meant.
FRANK
I don't understand.
SARAH
Come here and let me explain it to

you.

Reaching out, she takes his shirt and pulls him into a
kiss.

EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
SUPERED TITLE: DUNNING ESTATE, MARYLAND

This epic mansion sits behind gated walls, surrounded by
tennis courts, a pool, a helicopter pad, guest houses,
and rolling lawns from the woods down to the water.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Frank sits with his back against a tree as Marvin checks
it out with binoculars. They're both clad in black.

MARVIN
Rent-a-cops. Video. Infrared
alarms. All the usual crap.

EXT. WOODS - SNIPER'S NEST - NIGHT

Sarah lies in the dirt beside Victoria who sets up a camo-
draped rifle almost as tall as she is.

SARAH
Frank said you wanted me with you.

VICTORIA
He thought it would be safer and I
thought it would be fun to have a
little girl time; get to know each
other, talk about the boys. Plus
I wanted you to know that in all
the years I've known Francis, I've
never seen him like this, so if
you break his heart, I'll kill you
and bury your body in the woods.

Sarah looks at her, stunned. Victoria smiles.
79.
VICTORIA (cont'd)
This is going to be fun.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - NIGHT

A security guard escorts Joe, in his wheelchair and three-
piece suit, up to the main house.

INT. DUNNING'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

A butler leads the way into a sumptuous study: hardwood,
heavy furniture, and leather.

JOE
Nice place. In fact, I'm not sure
I've ever been in a room this nice.

ANDREW DUNNING, portly and rich, sits behind his desk,
looking Joe over skeptically.

JOE (cont'd)
How big is that TV?

DUNNING
What can I do for you, Mr. Matheson,
was it?
Joe grins.
JOE

We just have a few questions.

Suddenly Frank appears behind the startled butler, quickly
zip-tying his hands.

Marvin appears in another doorway, hustling in three
security guards, their hands zip-tied behind their backs.

FRANK
Put them with the others.

Dunning looks between them angrily as Frank cuffs him
into his chair.

DUNNING
Who are you?

FRANK
You don't remember me?

(beat )
I remember you.
80.
INSERT - EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - OLD 16MM FOOTAGE - DAY

The man wearing a short sleeved civilian button-down steps
towards young Frank and Marvin.

He's put on weight and lost hair, but the man is Dunning.
RETURN TO SCENE
FRANK
Tell us what happened in
Afghanistan.
A beat as this registers.
DUNNING
You can't touch me. You have no
idea what you're dealing with.

Frank glances at Marvin walking back in.

FRANK
We have any idea what we're dealing
with?

MARVIN

Not really. Maybe a little.

FRANK
Can we touch him?

MARVIN
Definitely.

Frank starts unpacking a bag: blowtorch, drain cleaner,
Vice Grips...

JOE
(to Dunning)
Did you know that Frank here wrote
the CIA field manual on torture?
The old one.

DUNNING
Wait. Hold on a minute...

Frank fires up the blowtorch.

FRANK
I like this one. Where'd you get
it?
Dunning stares in fear.
MARVIN

Home Depot. Twelve bucks.
81.

FRANK
No kidding.

Frank holds out the torch and Marvin puts a pair of Vice
Grips in the flame.

DUNNING
PLEASE!

They glance over as though seeing Dunning for the first
time.

DUNNING (cont'd)
I ran the Afghan operation.

FRANK
What did you take out of there?

DUNNING
It wasn't a what. It was a who...
INSERT - INT. C-130 - OLD 16MM FOOTAGE - NIGHT
YOUNG GABRIEL LOEB glances back out the cockpit door as
Dunning drags aboard a YOUNG SOLDIER with a thousand yard
stare, covered in blood and dirt.
DUNNING (V.0O.)
We extracted a young Second
Lieutenant. He was the son of
then Senator, Henry Stanton.
RETURN TO SCENE

This quietly sinks in.

JOE
Robert Stanton.
FRANK
The Vice President of the United
States?
Dunning nods.
MARVIN
Holy crap.
FRANK
He was responsible for what happened
there?
DUNNING

That's what the New York Times
reporter wanted to know.
82.

FRANK
What did you tell her?
DUNNING
I said I didn't know anything about
it.
FRANK
Then you called the Vice President.
DUNNING
(defensive)

Of course. Our families have been
friends for years.

MARVIN
WHAT DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN?

FRANK
He ordered everyone killed. Except
you.

DUNNING

I didn't know that!
Victoria's voice interrupts, crackling over the radio.
VICTORIA (V.0.)
We have major activity on the
perimeter. Somebody serious is
setting up shop.
Dunning smiles at Frank, cocky once again.
DUNNING
You're finished. The Company's

had me under surveillance since
your little stunt over there.

EXT. WOODS - SNIPER'S NEST - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Victoria lies dead still, sighting through her scope as
Sarah fidgets nervously.

SARAH
I don't see how you can be so calm.

Victoria smiles.

VICTORIA
So how did you two meet?

This isn't what she expected, but Sarah allows herself to
be deflected.
83.

SARAH
We just started talking. There
was something about him...
(beat)
Of course, now I'm a fugitive, the
CIA wants to kill me, and I'm hiding
in a hole.

VICTORIA
I was in love once, with an agent.

SARAH
What happened?

VICTORIA
The relationship wasn't sanctioned.
When it came to light, my loyalty
was questioned. I was told to
kill him. It was a test.

She says it all so matter of factly. Sarah looks at her
stunned.

SARAH
What did you do?

VICTORIA
I put three rounds in his chest.

EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - COMMAND POST - NIGHT -
ESTABLISHING

Heavily armed COMMANDOS in body armor and black continue
to unload from FBI vans as the FBI COMMANDER wades through
the deployment, finding Cooper and handing him a phone.

FBI COMMANDER
We're in position, sir. Perimeter's
set. No one's getting out.

INT. DUNNING'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Marvin lies on the floor peering out a window.

JOE
How's it look?

MARVIN
Remember the Alamo?

VICTORIA (V.0.)
They have sniper positions on North,
West, and East sides.

(more)
84.
VICTORIA (V.0.) (cont'd)
Ground personnel in force out front
and backup in the rear. I'd
estimate sixty total.
The phone on the desk begins to RING.

Frank picks it up.

INTERCUT - EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - COMMAND POST - NIGHT

COOPER

I've been reading your file.
FRANK

Learn anything about how to be an

agent yet?
Cooper's calm and even, pacing as he talks.

COOPER

You've done a lot of service for
this country. And when I put that
together with your CIA visit where
the only person that got hurt was
me - I would say you value American
lives.

(beat)
But if we come through that door,
people are going to get hurt.

FRANK
I expect so.

COOPER
You don't want that.

FRANK
I didn't start this.

COOPER
I have orders.

FRANK

They're coming from the Vice
President. He ordered these hits
to cover up war crimes he committed
in Afghanistan in September 1981.
(beat)
I buried the bodies in '81. They
have you doing it now. You're
killing everyone who was there.

Cooper doesn't bat an eye.
85.

COOPER
I don't believe that.

FRANK
If you did, would it matter?

Cooper thinks it over, weighing it out.

COOPER
Yes.

FRANK
So what do you propose to do about
that?

COOPER

You give yourself up. I'1l take
you into custody. You'll get to
tell your side of the story.

Frank smiles grimly.

FRANK
Sure I will. Even if you brought
me in, someone would just put a
bullet in my head.

COOPER
That's not true.

FRANK
If you actually believe that, you're
even more naive than I thought.
COOPER
You're surrounded. The FBI is
going to take you apart. There is
no exit here. But how it goes
down is up to you.

Cooper hangs up.

INT. DUNNING'S HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Frank watches Marvin laying out his numerous weapons.
Joe puts a hand on Frank's shoulder.

JOE
We don't have a lot of options, Kid.

FRANK
Yeah.
86.
JOE
Somebody's going to have to make
the tough choice if any of us are
going to make it out alive.

A long, quiet moment of understanding passes between them:
love and sadness.

JOE (cont'd)
I think you're going to have to
give yourself up.

Finally Frank nods.

EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - COMMAND POST - NIGHT
Cooper's phone RINGS. He answers.

FRANK (V.0.)
Hold your fire, I'm coming out.

Frank hangs up.
COOPER
All units hold fire. Repeat hold
all fire. He's coming out.

200 yards out, Cooper watches the front door of the house
open and a lone, black-clad figure steps out, hands raised.

CRACK! A shot rings out.
Frank falls.
Stunned, Cooper looks around furious...

COOPER (cont'd)
Who fired that shot?

No one says anything.

COOPER (cont'd)
WHERE DID THAT SHOT COME FROM!

He turns, reeling, realizing Frank was right: he's not in
control of this situation.

Cooper draws his weapon and charges towards the house.
Frank lies motionless on the walkway.
Cooper rolls the body over.

It's Joe Matheson, dressed in Frank's clothes. He's
dead.
87.
PUSH IN on Cooper.

Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the back of the house, and
RADIOS ARE SCREAMING.

FBI RADIO (V.0.)
FBI sniper teams are taking fire!
Two suspects have broken perimeter!
COOPER
Hell...
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - BACK FIELD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Frank and Marvin race across an open field, making for
the woods in the distance.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - FBI SNIPER NEST - NIGHT -
CONTINUOUS
An FBI sniper and his spotter squirm down into their cover
as rounds SLAP into the ground inches from them.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - SNIPER'S NEST - NIGHT

Victoria lies prone, coolly squeezing off round after
round keeping the sniper teams scrambling for cover.

VICTORIA
Now isn't this worth sitting ina
hole for?
Sarah looks at her like she's insane.
VICTORIA (cont'd)
Keep an eye on the boys. When
they make cover, we move.
Suddenly they're taking SMALL ARMS FIRE.
Victoria whips around, firing back, pulling Sarah up and
pushing her into a run.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - WOODS - CONTINUOUS
Frank and Marvin hit the cover of the woods and immediately
change direction, scrambling uphill.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - BACK FIELD - CONTINUOUS

A dozen men charge towards the woods in pursuit.
88.
EXT. MARYLAND ESTATE - WOODED HILL - CONTINUOUS

Sarah runs just ahead of Victoria, crashing through the
forest...

...Straight into the arms of a black-clad COMMANDO.

He pins her, covering her mouth as his three partners
cover the woods behind her, scoping for Victoria.

...but there is nothing but SILENCE.

EXT. ESTATE WALL - NIGHT

Frank slips over the wall, Marvin just behind him.
Sneaking up the perimeter, they suddenly raise weapons...
...and Victoria slips from the shadows with her rifle.

VICTORIA
They have Sarah.

Frank turns back to the estate wall: he's going over.
VICTORIA (cont'd)
You can't.
(beat)
How many are you willing to kill?

SOUNDS RISE as people crash through the underbrush behind
them.

Up the road, other forces are closing in.

VICTORIA (cont'd)
Live to fight another day, Francis.

Sickened, Frank knows she's right.

INT. DUNNING'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
Two of the COMMANDOS move in, covering the room.
Dunning sits cuffed in his chair.

COMMANDO #1
Clear!

COMMANDO #2
Mr. Dunning?

DUNNING
Yes. Thank God.
89.
FSST!  FSST! The commando fires twice from a SILENCED
pistol.
EXT. VIRGINIA WOODS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Leading the way out of the woods, Frank pauses at the
edge of a creek and a small country road.

A helicopter flies overhead, searchlight cutting the
darkness.

And directly across from them a limo sits under the trees.

The door opens and out steps Ivan Siderov.

IVAN
Come! Now is not time to waste.
FRANK
How. ..?
The Russian smiles wide.
IVAN
You are not the only country with
satellites.
MARVIN

(aside to Frank)
Why would he be helping us..?

But Ivan is staring at Victoria.

IVAN
Zaychick moy.

She smiles back.

VICTORIA
Hello Ivan. It's good to see you.

Frank looks between them.

FRANK
Did he just call you... bunny?

VICTORIA
Life, sometimes, is complicated.
90.
EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

I/E. BACK DECK - NIGHT

Victoria sits on the wide arm of Frank's chair, changing
the dressings on his wounds. Through it all she somehow
still manages to look stunning.

Marvin's off to one side, staring out into the night.

Ivan puts the finishing touches on a pitcher of martinis
and pours a round.

FRANK
To Joe.

Everyone raises their glasses.

ALL
To Joe.

FRANK
A life of service and sacrifice.

They drink.
It's a long somber beat.
Finally Victoria breaks the silence.
VICTORIA
Does anyone want to discuss the
fact that we're all dead?

MARVIN
It ain't over till it's over.

VICTORIA
The CIA's being used as the Vice
President's personal hit squad.

It's a bit of a conversation crusher. Ivan holds up the
pitcher.

IVAN
Anyone like another?

Victoria and Marvin raise their glasses.
FRANK

They say he's going to run for
President.
91.

VICTORIA
I don't think it's possible to
outrun this. It's only a matter
of time until they find us.

IVAN
You could come to Mother Russia.

MARVIN
When hell freezes over.

IVAN
St. Petersburg in the spring is
very beautiful.

FRANK
Anyone else?

They think it over.

VICTORIA
Veritas vos liberabit. The truth
will set you free.

MARVIN
Tell people?

VICTORIA
It's a thought.

MARVIN
What about Frank's girlfriend?
What's her name? The cute one.
They'd kill her so fast. Of course
they might have already. But
they'll interrogate her first. In
fact, she's probably getting
waterboarded right now...

VICTORIA
Marvin.

MARVIN
What?

He looks over at Frank who gets up, heading inside.
MARVIN (cont'd)
Oh.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Frank stands at the kitchen sink as Ivan walks in.

IVAN
You okay?
92.

FRANK
No.

IVAN
I want to show you something.

He starts unbuttoning his shirt.

IVAN (cont'd)
Don't get too excited.

Pulling it open reveals old scars from three bullet wounds.

IVAN (cont'd)
This was done to me by the love of
my life. It seemed that what we
had was not meant to be. But now
she is sitting in my house drinking
vodka.

FRANK
Victoria?

IVAN
Three bullets in the chest. But
when I woke up alive, I knew that
she still loved me - or it would
have been the head.

Frank can't help but smile. Ivan buttons his shirt.

IVAN (cont'd)
Was a big risk for her of course,
but one does crazy things for love.
Look at me. I guarantee, helping
you today is not a good career

move.
(shrugs)

But you only live once, right?
(beat )

Do not fear, my friend. With a
small, dedicated group, there is
little that can not be accomplished.

INT. CIA - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - NIGHT
Cooper stands across the desk from Stevens.

COOPER
Someone took that shot. That's
either another team in play or
someone in our ranks. And the
Dunning execution? That doesn't
feel like Moses to me.

Stevens considers.
93.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
I'll look into it.

COOPER
That's it?

Stevens is calm and thoughtful.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Do your job. I'll figure this
out.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Sarah sits in an interrogation room with an observation
mirror, a table and two chairs bolted to the floor.

The door opens and Cooper enters with Frank's file. He
takes a seat across from her and sets it between them.

COOPER
There will be no lawyer. No one
is coming. There will be no record
of what transpires here.

She stares at him.

COOPER (cont'd)
You're going to tell me what other
agents are involved with Frank
Moses, who helped him escape, and
what his relationship is to that
government.

Cooper puts a satellite photograph on top of Frank's file
that shows Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Ivan by the limo,
but if you didn't know, an ID would be impossible.

COOPER (cont'd)
If you cooperate fully, there may
be a light at the end of the tunnel.
Until then, there is nothing I can
not do to you. Nothing.

Sarah, shaking, slowly starts to cry.

COOPER (cont'd)
Look at the picture.

She takes the file with trembling hands, and...

Swinging as hard as she can, she catches Cooper full in
the face with the six-inch-thick file. WHAM!

He goes down and she's around the table and out the door...
94.
...where two LARGE GUARDS jump up, ready to grab her.
Sarah stops, realizing it's futile.

Turning, she walks back into the interrogation room where
Cooper's regaining his feet.

She looks at him, icy, all traces of false emotion gone.

SARAH

The reason other people are involved
is because they have honor and
integrity. Stuff you wouldn't
know about.

(beat )
So do what you need to do. And
they'll do what they need to do.
And at the end of the day, we'll
see who comes out in one piece.

Cooper smiles.

COOPER
You really do care for each other.

Sarah stares at him.
COOPER (cont'd)

That's how I'm going to get him.

Thank you.
INT. VICE PRESIDENT STANTON'S OFFICE - DAY
VICE PRESIDENT ROBERT STANTON, sitting alone in his dark
office, looks up from his desk as the Director of
Operations is ushered in.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Mr. Vice President.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Gary.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
I just received a report that Andrew
Dunning is dead.
The Vice President considers, looking at him evenly.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I heard.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Is everything all right, sir?
95.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
He was a good friend. He would
have been pleased I'm going to
seek the nomination.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Yes sir.
(beat)
Is there anything I can do for you?

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
No.

Stevens walks out, troubled.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY
Cooper's at his desk. Jackson and Thomas sit waiting.
A phone RINGS. Thomas nods at Cooper.

THOMAS
Trace is running.

Cooper hits a button and picks up the phone.

COOPER
Operations.

FRANK (0.S.)
Here's the thing, Cooper. With
age comes a certain perspective.
I'm not sure you have what it takes
to appreciate my position.

Cooper smiles.

COOPER
Try me.

THOMAS
(background)
It's a land line.

INTERCUT - INT. HOME OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Frank leans back in his chair, rubbing his temples.

FRANK
I keep going over in my head if I
was ever like you: the blind
ambition and misplaced trust. I
don't know.
96.

COOPER
Does it matter?

FRANK
It might help me decide what to do
next.

COOPER

What are you thinking about?

FRANK
There's a lot of hard things about
our business. But in all my years,
it wasn't the killing, or the
stress, or the pay that bothered
me. I didn't even realize what it
was until it was too late.

Cooper looks at Thomas who whispers...

THOMAS
Almost there...

COOPER
What was it?

FRANK

It's how anything you love can be
used against you. It taught me
never to invest. Never to care.
(beat )
Once I became Frank Moses I lived
my entire life without attachments.
It took discipline, but I was damn
good at it.
(beat)
And then I met Sarah. And now you
have her. It's the worst thing in
the world to know that your enemies
could hurt the ones you love. The
feeling of powerlessness is almost
indescribable.

Cooper sits back, smug.

THOMAS
Got him!

Thomas excitedly scribbles an address on a pad and holds
it up to Cooper.

Cooper goes pale. He looks like he's going to be sick.

FRANK
You there, Cooper?
97.

COOPER
(covering the phone)
My house! He's at my house!

Jackson and Thomas scramble for phones.

Frank sits back, putting his feet up on the home office
desk with pictures of Cooper, his wife and kids.

FRANK
It's just like I said, isn't it:
almost indescribable.

Cooper looks like a shell of a man.

COOPER
Please...

Frank's tone shifts.

FRANK
Shut up! It's time to grow up and
look at what's going on.

COOPER
Don't hurt them...

FRANK
Listen carefully. This is the
part I was talking about where I'm
not sure you have what it takes to
understand.

As the others shout orders behind him, Cooper listens,
riveted.

FRANK (cont'd)
I've spent my life doing terrible
things for the CIA because I
believed what I was doing was right.
But when you find out that you've
been a tool for corrupt political
ends, like I was in Afghanistan,
and like you're are now, you have
to take a stand. This is a stain
on our souls, Cooper.

There's a long beat.

COOPER
What are you going to do?

FRANK
The right thing. The moral thing.
The thing you'd do yourself if you
had any balls at all.

(more)
98.
FRANK (cont'd)
(pause)
I'm going to kill the Vice President.
A reaction ripples through the room: oh shit.
FRANK (cont'd)
But my question, Cooper, is this.
What are you going to do?
CLICK. The line goes dead.

Cooper sits shell-shocked.

EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE - DAY

A SWAT van SCREECHES to a halt before the house, disgorging
men who swarm the house...

...scaring the hell out of Cooper's wife and children in
the middle of a backyard soccer game.
INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS
The phone rings and it's in Cooper's hand in an instant.
SWAT (V.0.)
They're fine, sir. They never
even knew he was here.
Relief washes over him like a physical wave.

COOPER
Let me talk to my wife.

Jackson looks over at Cooper holding the line.
JACKSON
Why didn't he take them?
(beat)
We would have. You have his girl.
Cooper glances around the room. All eyes are on him.
COOPER
I don't know.
EXT. SELF-STORAGE UNIT - DAY

A rusty door rolls up revealing Frank and Marvin peering
into this storage unit full of cheap dusty cabinets.

Pulling them open reveals a trove of rifles, machine guns,
grenade launchers and mortars.
99.
Marvin looks at Frank.

MARVIN
I want you to know I'm very excited.

FRANK
Back in '78 I thought I'd put a
few things aside, you know, just
in case.

Opening a locker, Frank pulls out a pair of vintage
aviators and tries them on.

MARVIN
Explosives?

FRANK
Just past the ammo.

Marvin opens a locker: blocks of C-4, detonators, and
primer-cord.

MARVIN

I love you, man!
EXT. CHICAGO - THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
SUPERED TITLE: CHICAGO
This swank Miracle Mile landmark rises into the night
with a steady stream of limos arriving out front.
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
Crystal chandeliers hang above a red, white and blue
decorated stage. Sumptuous tables surround a dance floor

where a band plays as WEALTHY DONORS mingle.

SECRET SERVICE AGENTS stand discretely around the perimeter
of the large room, watching guests schmooze.

ON STAGE

Cooper confers with a tall thin man, AGENT BURBACHER, the
head of Vice President Stanton's security detail.

AGENT BURBACHER
My team is set. You have anything?

COOPER
No.

Burbacher keys an inconspicuous radio.
100.
AGENT BURBACHER

This is Burbacher. He's clear for

entry.
Cooper heads off stage as behind him VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
strides in, smiling a wide politician's smile as he's
immediately surrounded and shaking hands.
Cooper joins Jackson off to one side.

JACKSON
Everything all right?

COOPER
I just have a feeling.

Cooper moves on and Thomas steps up.

THOMAS
He has a feeling?
JACKSON
No wonder Secret Service is sick

of us.
As they look out, studying the crowd, Ivan Siderov passes
behind them, wearing a tux, blending in perfectly.
INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper walks into the kitchen, instantly assaulted by
bright lights, heat, and dozens of people yelling at each
other in different languages.

Surveying the perimeter, Cooper notes the placement of
three Secret Service agents, and then heads out.

But WE STAY, following a BUSBOY wheeling a trash can past
Secret Service and outside.

EXT. HOTEL - DUMPSTERS/LOADING DOCK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The busboy heaves his can up, emptying it into a dumpster...

...and is suddenly yanked up and over, disappearing inside.

INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT
Rolling the can back inside past Secret Service...

...is Marvin.
101.
Pushing the can into a dry storage closet, he reaches in,

pulling out two heavy garbage bags which he sets on the
floor with a METALLIC THUD.

EXT. THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

A doorman opens a limo and out steps Victoria, looking
absolutely stunning in a body-hugging, full-length gown.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Victoria enters, garnering appreciative looks as she makes
her way to the ballroom.

SECURITY CHECK
Stepping through the metal detector she generates a BEEP.

VICTORIA
Oh, of course.

Removing her heavy multi-strand necklace, she places it
in a velvet tray held by a deferential young woman, then
steps through cleanly.

SECURITY WOMAN
Thank you, ma'am.

But putting the necklace back on, she drops her clutch.

Someone is there instantly, picking it up and handing it
back.

VICTORIA
Thank you so much.

MARVIN
Of course.

He walks off. She closes her clutch over whatever he
slipped her and presents her invitation to the table of
GREETERS.

GREETER
Welcome Ms. Smith. It's a pleasure
to have you at our 2012 victory
fund gala.

Victoria smiles wide.

VICTORIA
The pleasure is all mine.
102.
INT. BALLROOM FOYER - NIGHT

Cooper stands looking out the windows as introductory
remarks drone on behind him.

Pedestrians pass back and forth outside, but something
catches his attention in the distance.

A FIGURE stands across the street, watching the hotel.

His collar's up and he's wearing a hat, but in the
headlights of a passing car...

...it's Frank.
Cooper's instantly running, yelling into his radio.

COOPER
I have visual contact. Front of
the hotel, across the street....

EXT. THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NIGHT

Bursting from the hotel, Cooper races down the steps, gun
out as he plows into traffic.

Jackson and Thomas run after their boss, closing the gap
until they reach him at the corner where the figure was.

Cooper's looking around wildly, but there's no one there,
no one retreating, nothing.

Except... on a window ledge where Frank was standing,
there's a single .45 caliber cartridge. Cooper picks it
up, staring at the bullet...

COOPER
Back inside! Now!

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

Cooper and Agent Burbacher square off, quietly but
intensely, as the event continues behind them.

COOPER
Moses is here. You have to pull
the VP.

AGENT BURBACHER
Just like in Jacksonville? The
moment there is confirmed threat,
I will call it. Until then...

COOPER
I just saw him...
103.

AGENT BURBACHER
This isn't me. This is him. He's
had enough of you. If there is
something actionable we will act.
Until then, this conversation is
finished.

He turns and leaves, Cooper staring after him, stunned.

INTRO SPEAKER
...And so it is with great pleasure,
I introduce to you, Vice President
Robert Stanton!

The crowd bursts into THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE as Stanton takes
the stage, waving. Cooper keys his radio.

COOPER
Stand ready.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I'll keep it short, so you'll
actually write those checks you're
promising.

As the audience laughs, WE CUT AROUND THE ROOM to all the
Secret Service and CIA Agents in play.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)

It is this group here tonight that
got us into the White House. And
it is this group that will keep us
there.

(beat)
My friends, I have not yet made
the announcement publicly, but
it's my intention to seek the
nomination of our party for the
presidency in 2012.

There's APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

Burbacher stands at the front of the stage staring out
into the lights...

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)
We've come a long way together,
but our best years are still ahead!
So be generous. Get your friends
to be generous, and I look forward
to speaking with all of you across
the course of the evening.

Jackson and Thomas flank Cooper, waiting...
104.
VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)
God bless you all. And God bless
America.
The MUSIC KICKS IN and APPLAUSE EXPLODES.
We PRESS IN on Cooper and...
BANG!

A SINGLE SHOT RINGS OUT. Cooper draws, looking for the
gun...

...but sees only Jackson and Thomas staring at him like
he's crazy as other champagne bottles POP.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)
Please join Adyline and me on the
dance floor for a spin before dinner.
Chagrined, Cooper holsters his weapon.

COOPER
I'm stepping out.

Couples fill the floor as he walks out past...
VICTORIA
scanning the crowd, waiting...

...and suddenly there is an arm around her, sweeping her
around and onto the dance floor.

IVAN
Hello, bunny.
She glares at him.
VICTORIA
Moves like that could get you
killed.
IVAN

Your radiance this evening renders
me almost speechless.

VICTORIA
Almost.

He leads a turn and spin which she executes perfectly.
Ivan smiles wide.

VICTORIA (cont'd)
What are you grinning at?
105.

IVAN
You know I have always dreamed of
killing the American President.

VICTORIA
Vice President.
IVAN
Tsch. Whatever. Having you in my
arms again... I get carried away.
VICTORIA
Really.
IVAN

Tell me you love me.
The song winds to a close, but he continues to dance.

VICTORIA
The song, Ivan. It's over.

IVAN
Is it?
(beat )
Ah. To work then.
Breaking their embrace, he heads off...

VICTORIA
Ivan!

He looks back and fumblingly she tries to hand him a small
spray canister from her clutch.

IVAN
Oh. Yes. Of course.

He takes it, kisses her hand, and melts into the crowd.

Victoria sits, flushed, and for the first time we've seen
her, not totally cool.

IVAN

moves through the crowded reception, canister held low at
his side, covertly spraying a PUFF here and there.

People begins to SNIFF and a low murmur rises.
VICTORIA

makes her way to the main ballroom doors, pulling them
closed. Stepping out, she calls back into the room.

VICTORIA
Gas! Oh my God! I smell GAS!
106.
IVAN
on the opposite side of the room, pulls the fire alarm.
IVAN
FIRE!
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Cooper, splashing water on his face, looks up as ALARMS
RING OUT.
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
As SCREAMS RISE inside, Victoria pulls her necklace apart
into individual cable loops, wrapping them through the
handles of all the ballroom doors and clipping them shut,
locking everyone inside.
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
PANIC RIPS THROUGH THE CROWD with Ivan doing his best to
incite a riot, running with hands above his head, screaming
like a little girl...

IVAN
It's going to blow!

AGENT BURBACHER

is in full control, his team immediately locking down the
vP, pulling him to the back of the room.

AGENT BURBACHER
Stairwell two. Move! Move! Move!

COOPER

bursts into the ballroom, stunned at the chaos before
him: people screaming and running, totally out of control.

COOPER
(into radio)
Shadow the VP.
INT. STAIRWELL 2 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

With two agents on point, four with the VP, and two in
the rear, the Secret Service team hustles down the stairs.
107.
INT. EXECUTIVE ELEVATOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

A LONE Secret Service AGENT stands before this elevator,
trying to follow the action on his ear-piece.

Victoria appears at the far end of the hall.

LONE AGENT
This is a restricted area.

She smiles, smoothly making her way up the hall.

VICTORIA
I'm sure I'm allowed.
LONE AGENT
Ma'am. Stop. This area is off

limits!

She continues forward, completely unfazed as the agent
draws his weapon.

VICTORIA
(amused )
Put that away. Do you know who I
am?
LONE AGENT

Stop or I will be forced to treat
you as a threat.

She smiles even wider.
VICTORIA
Look at this dress. Where, exactly,
is the threat?

The agent looks her over as she puts up her hands and
closes the rest of the distance and...

WHAM: the gun is twisted out of his hand as he takes a
chop to the side of the neck and goes down.

Victoria takes a moment to fix her boobs as Marvin enters
the hall with two duffel bags.

They step into the elevator, she inserts a fireman's key,
and hits G.
INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Burbacher's point men burst out of the stairwell, covering
the garage and pulling open the doors of the waiting car.

Burbacher and close security pile the VP into the car and
it peels out, rounding a corner and...
108.

Is ripped apart by automatic fire, heavy rounds pulverizing
the front of the car, sending it smashing into a wall.

Screaming commands, Burbacher forces the VP out, using
the car as a shield as rounds continue to pour in.

POINT MAN AGENT
What the hell are they using?
INSERT - VICTORIA
... blazing away with a belt-fed machine gun.

Behind her, Marvin fires bolts into the concrete, setting
something up.

RETURN TO SCENE
Burbacher screams into his radio.
AGENT BURBACHER
We're taking heavy fire! Everyone
move in! Get a car in here!

INT. GARAGE - ONE FLOOR UP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper and his team run down the garage ramp from one
level up.

COOPER
Stay low, flank them.
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
The doors give way and as a mass of trapped, screaming
people charge safely for the exit, Ivan saunters after
them, lifting a glass of Champagne from a table.
INT. LOBBY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Sipping the drink, he calmly makes his way to the
elevators, tapping twice on the second one from the left.

The doors roll open revealing Frank dressed ina
conservative suit and tie.

IVAN
Good evening, Frank.

FRANK
Ivan.

He steps out as Ivan steps in, the doors rolling closed.
109.
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
SOOTHING MUSIC plays in the background.
AS Ivan descends, he begins to hum the RUSSIAN NATIONAL
ANTHEM, quietly at first, then louder and more
enthusiastically, conducting with his drink until...

DING: the doors roll open onto chaos:

INSERT - GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

...where a huge fire-fight is unfolding: the Secret Service
team pinned down as another ARMORED LIMO moves in to get
them cover.

Culminating the anthem, Ivan pulls a remote from his jacket
and presses the button: a huge explosion rips out the

front end of the back-up limo.

RETURN TO SCENE

The elevator doors roll back closed on the DEAFENING
ACTION, and Ivan leans back, sips his drink, and listens

to the SOOTHING MUSIC once again.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

As smoke from the limo explosion fills the air, Burbacher
grabs his guys, and the VP.

AGENT BURBACHER
We're moving! South Exit! Go!

They break for the stairs as shots ring out behind them.

INT. GARAGE - SECOND LEVEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper's team angles in behind Victoria and Marvin's
position, one row of cars back, listening to the FIRE.

COOPER
On my command. Two. One. Go!

They break, moving in, and...
The machine gun stands on a tripod, UNMANNED, firing bursts.
Cooper stares at it, furious, realizing...

COOPER (cont'd)
Outside! Outside!
110.
EXT. THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

SWAT, firemen, and EMTs pour into the building.

INT. SUB LEVEL ONE - ACCESS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Gun in one hand, Vice President's arm in the other,
Burbacher leads the Secret Service team running through
the access corridors under the hotel into a...

INT. ROOM SERVICE PREP KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

AGENT BURBACHER
Secret Service! Everybody down.

Workers duck as the team crosses the room.
But Burbacher sees something, shoving the VP down...

...as AUTOMATIC FIRE rakes the counter.

ANGLE ON MARVIN AND VICTORIA

In a side corridor. She empties the magazine and he hands
her another as they watch kitchen workers scatter and the
Secret Service return fire.

MARVIN
I remember the Secret Service being
tougher.

VICTORIA
Me too.

But suddenly they're taking fire from behind, bullets
SLAPPING in to the wall around them.

Marvin ducks, drawing a machine pistol and spraying the
corridor.

MARVIN
I think it's SWAT.

VICTORIA (0.S.)
We have a problem, Marvin.

He looks over.

Victoria's on the floor, her dress awash in blood from a
gunshot wound in her side.

Marvin's instantly in motion, delving into a duffel bag,
pulling cans of smoke, yanking pins, tossing them out.
111.
With smoke adding a new layer of confusion to the SHOUTING
and GUNFIRE, he picks up Victoria, heading up a different
corridor.

He hustles forward as fast as he can, but the SOUNDS OF
PURSUIT rise behind him.

Marvin fires back down the hall, then pulls open a door
revealing a utility closet and leans her inside.

VICTORIA (cont'd)
What the hell?

MARVIN
No choice.

She look at him, realizing he's right.
Stripping off his jacket, he puts it around Victoria.

Stepping back REVEALS he's wearing a vest, covered in
plastic explosives.

VICTORIA
Good luck.

He gives her a wink.

MARVIN
You only live once, right?

He shuts the door, and takes off up the hall.

A moment later, a SWAT assault unit sweeps up the hall
after him.

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

Victoria takes off her shoes, pulls Marvin's jacket tight
around her and tries to stand up.

INT. SUB LEVEL ONE - NIGHT

Stumbling out of the smoke, Burbacher checks the VP for
wounds until Stanton pushes him off.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I'm fine. Just get me the hell
out of here.

AGENT BURBACHER
Kelsey! James! Up front.
112.
INT. SUB LEVEL ONE - HALL - NIGHT

Victoria makes her way forward, weak but deliberate, her
breathing fast and shallow.

Rounding a corner she finds herself at a steel security
gate pulled across the concrete corridor.

SHOUTS and FOOTSTEPS rise behind her.
Defeated, she presses her face against the cold metal.

IVAN (0.S.)
Perhaps I can be of some assistance?

She looks up, finding him on the other side of the gate,
already reaching through, picking the lock.

Smiling as the gate swings open, she takes his arm.
VICTORIA
I love you.
INT. WIDE CORRIDOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The Secret Service team clears a stairwell emerging into
a wide ground-floor corridor of the hotel.

The corridor is empty, but Burbacher halts his team,
looking around.

From the darkness at one end of the hall, a lone figure
emerges.

It's Marvin, covered in explosives, holding a dead-man
trigger in one hand.

The VP looks up in horror.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Oh God...

AGENT BURBACHER
Go!

The whole team takes off, pulling along the VP, running
all-out towards the doors at the end of the hall.

Marvin starts after them, fingering the trigger, screaming
like a madman.

MARVIN
AAAAAAAAAAAAGH !
113.
EXT. THE ALLERTON HOTEL - NORTH SIDE - NIGHT

An explosion rips out of the hotel, a fireball billowing
up into the night...

...as the Secret Service team spills out the door.
People outside run SCREAMING in all directions, but...
A SECRET SERVICE LIMO

...screeches to a halt beside the agents.

Burbacher and another agent pull the VP into the car and
it peels out.

IVAN AND VICTORIA

stand among the refugee guests, onlookers, and emergency
workers, watching from a distance as the car disappears
into the night.

VICTORIA
He made it.

IVAN
That's it then.

CUT TO:

I/E. LIMOUSINE - DRIVING - NIGHT

With the VP between them, Agent Burbacher shares a look
of palpable relief with the other Agent as the car SQUEALS
around a turn, putting the hotel behind them.

AGENT BURBACHER
(into radio)
We're clear. En route to airport
now.

CONTROL (V.0.)
Copy that.

The limo pulls onto the highway, speeding into the night.
VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
(furious)
How the hell did that happen?
Burbacher forces himself to keep cool.

AGENT BURBACHER
I don't know yet, sir.

The other Agent checks behind them for a tail: nothing.
114.

OTHER AGENT
Looks clear.

DRIVER (0.S.)
Copy that.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES FORWARD to REVEAL that FRANK is
the driver.

He puts on his signal and pulls over beneath an overpass.

AGENT BURBACHER
Why are we stopping?

Frank turns and fires a tazer, sending him into convulsions.

The other Agent reaches for his gun, but ZAP, gets tazed
as well.

Stanton stares at Frank in horror.
ZAP !
CUT TO:

INT. LIMOUSINE - DRIVING - NIGHT

Stanton slowly comes around in the back seat, groaning.
His Secret Service Agents are gone.

His hands are zip-tied behind his back.

Frank glances at him in the rear view mirror.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Who are you?

FRANK
Frank Moses.
(beat)
One of the men you ordered killed.

The Vice President looks at him in fear.
VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I don't know what you're talking
about.
Frank lets it go, just driving.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)
What do you want?

FRANK
From you? Nothing.
115.
Stanton senses this is bad.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I'm sure we can negotiate
something...

FRANK
So now it's coming back to you?

Stanton pipes down.

FRANK (cont'd)

Or have there been so many that
they all just blur together? Maybe
you don't even think about it.

(beat)
I was prepared to live my life in
peace. You couldn't even let me
have that.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I don't know....

FRANK
Afghanistan. I was there.

Stanton suddenly looks like he's been gut-punched. Like
he's about to be sick.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Can we talk about this?

FRANK
You can talk all you want.

Frank slowly pulls over into a deserted lot near an
industrial waterfront area beneath the El tracks.

FRANK (cont'd)
But I'm still going to kill you.

EXT. DESERTED LOT - NIGHT

He gets out of the car, opens the rear door, and pulls
Stanton out, spilling him into the dirt.

FRANK
On your knees.

The VP crawls up, coming apart, on the verge of tears.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I didn't kill anyone.
(sobbing)
I tried to stop it.
(more)
116.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (cont'd)
They pulled me out because my dad
knew it wouldn't matter. I was
there.

Frank unholsters his old .45 and crouches down to look
the VP in the eye.

FRANK
It's not that I want revenge. I
don't care about you. But there
are rules about how you treat your
tools. The people who do things
for you do it because they believe
in the greater good.

Frank holds up his set of dog tags. Now we see that the
name and number have been filed out.

FRANK (cont'd)
I joined up when I was seventeen
and took an oath to defend this
country. They stamped these tags
with the name my mother gave me.
Later the Company erased that name
forever. These are a symbol of
that sacrifice.

A train goes by overhead with a deafening ROAR.
Frank levels his gun at the Vice President.
FRANK (cont'd)
Today I am going to restore honor
to your office.
Suddenly bright lights pin Frank.

COOPER
Freeze!

Cooper emerges from a car, weapon drawn.

COOPER (cont'd)
Do this, you're dead!

Frank glances at Cooper, then back at the VP, as the
POUNDING of a helicopter draws close.

FRANK
I guess I'm okay with that.

He starts to move, but Cooper pulls Sarah from the car,
covering her with his weapon.

She and Frank lock eyes. So close but so far.
117.
He looks between her and the VP.

FRANK (cont'd)
I love you.

SARAH
I love you too.

Frank looks at Cooper.

FRANK
She goes free.

Cooper nods.

FRANK (cont'd)
Swear it on your family's life.

COOPER
I do.

Sarah looks between them, horrified.

SARAH
No...

Frank slowly lowers his .45.

It CLATTERS to the ground.

Jackson and Thomas move in on him, guns ready.

Frank puts his hands above his head, and as the chopper
lands, kicking up dust over the scene, his eyes never
leave Sarah's as he's cuffed.

Stevens gets out of the chopper.

Approaching Cooper, he eyes Frank and the VP.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
That's him?

COOPER
That's him.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Good work.

Cooper gives him a nod.

COOPER
Yes sir.

The VP approaches Stevens, still shaking, furious...
118.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
What the hell have you done? I
asked you to find out who knew
about Afghanistan to see if we
could control the story.

Frank watches this, trying to figure it out.

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Which is exactly what I did. I
protected this administration and
made this campaign possible. With
the stroke of a pen, I gave you a
shot at the presidency.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
You had people killed!

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
No one who mattered.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Americans!

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Nobody cares!

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
This isn't what I wanted!

Stevens smiles coldly.
DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
These aren't details you need to
be concerned about. All you need
to remember is that you owe me.
The VP starts towards him.

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Is that why you did this?

Cooper steps between them, stopping the VP.
He nods to Jackson and Thomas.
COOPER
Escort the Vice President to the
chopper.

They pull him away, leaving Cooper and Stevens alone with
Frank and Sarah.

Cooper takes out a syringe.

SARAH
No!
119.
Cooper steps to Frank who stares him down, unflinching.
Lashing out, Cooper jabs it into Stevens' neck.
He gasps, eyes bugging.

COOPER
You disgust me.

Clutching his chest, Stevens collapses to the ground.
Sarah looks away. But Frank's eyes never leave Cooper.
Uncuffing Frank, Cooper holds out his .45.
FRANK
Maybe there's some hope for the
Company after all.

COOPER
Maybe.

Frank takes the gun.
Sarah leaps into Frank's arms and they embrace.

COOPER (cont'd)
I want you to come back home.

FRANK
Home?

COOPER
A chance to work again. To train
the next generation.

Frank considers, then tosses Cooper his tags and takes
Sarah's hand.

FRANK
I'm retired.

Cooper watches them walk away.
COOPER
Where are you going to go, Frank?
What else do you have?

But suddenly a figure steps out of the darkness to meet
Frank: Marvin, carrying a RPG.

And then another figure emerges: Victoria, rifle slung.

A car starts in the darkness and pulls close: Ivan's behind
the wheel, still dressed in his tux.

Frank and Sarah embrace their friends.
120.
Frank looks back at Cooper, then slips into the car and
is gone.
INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
Frank and Sarah kiss...
And Ivan leans back, totally interrupting.
IVAN
So Frank. I was wondering if you
would go on little errand with me.

Victoria turns from the front passenger side.

VICTORIA
His timing is terrible.

IVAN
Is just a tiny little nuclear
problem in Moldova. A day or two,
no big thing. Sarah, you will
love the countryside.
Frank looks at him, stunned.
Marvin, squeezed in next to him, elbows him in the side.
MARVIN
Come on, man, it's just the safety
of the world.
Frank's about to answer and we...

FADE OUT.
