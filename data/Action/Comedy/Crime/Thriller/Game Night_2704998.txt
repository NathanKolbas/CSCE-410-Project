INT. PUB - NIGHT

MUSIC BLARES. We move past people drinking, playing POOL,
DARTS, BEER PONG and land on...

MAX (30's) sitting with a team in matching T-shirts. (His
says, “CAPTAIN.”) It’s a rowdy PUB TRIVIA NIGHT. Max pounds
a drink and yells at his team:

MAX
(slightly slurred)
Who cares about winning?! Let’s
get drunk!

His team CHEERS. Max walks over to the BARTENDER, dead sober:

MAX (CONT'D)
I need four shots of Everclear and
four shots of water.
(throwing down some bills)
Send the real ones to the other
team. Give us the water.

The Bartender snorts and starts pouring.

TRIVIA EMCEE (0.S.)
What former Supreme Court Justice--

MAX
(spinning around)
Oliver Wendell Holmes!

Max’s team CHEERS.
TRIVIA EMCEE
(annoyed)
That is correct. Again, I’d like
to ask the players to allow me to--

MAX
--finish the question!

His team laughs and cheers again.

Across the room, also wearing a “CAPTAIN” shirt, ANNIE (30's)
glares at her TEAMMATES, including BILL, a schlubby guy.

ANNIE
Come on, guys. Focus. This isn’t
a game!

BILL

It literally is.

ANNIE
Bill, I swear to god--
TRIVIA EMCEE
For triple points: what is the name
of the purple Teletubby?

The room quiets... There’s an intense beat then--

MAX ANNIE
Tinky Winky! Tinky Winky!

Max and Annie lock eyes, sparks flying.

MAX
(intense)
He always carried a--

ANNIE
(unblinking)
--red purse. I know.

There is a definite connection here.

INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

Max and Annie stand in the middle of a subway car, furiously
making out. The car suddenly comes to a stop and the couple
goes FLYING INTO A METAL POLE.

In a MONTAGE, Max and Annie WIN different GAME NIGHTS as
their relationship progresses:

--A SMALL STUDIO APARTMENT, playing the board game RISK with
another COUPLE, DAN and LINDA.

ANNIE
If you take Kamchatka and I take
Mongolia, we can trap Linda in the
middle.

MAX
Starve out her army. Smart.

LINDA
Hey! You can’t form alliances.

ANNIE
Worked for Hitler.

They high-five.

LINDA
You're high-fiving Hitler?!

--In A NICER APARTMENT, playing PICTIONARY. Max haphazardly
DRAWS a RECTANGLE.
ANNIE
“The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel”!

Other players protest. Max and Annie kiss.

--IN THEIR MODEST SUBURBAN HOUSE, playing CHARADES with Bill.
Max points to Bill and Annie guesses--

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Bill. Overweight. Single. Out of
work.

BILL
What the fuck?

ANNIE

Hairy?

(Max touches his nose)
Hairy. Carry. Mary.

(Max touches his nose)
Mary!

(Max points to himself)
You! Me!

Max gestures to put it together.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Marry me!

Annie does a crazy/cute victory dance but then:

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Wait-- What?

She turns back and sees Max on one knee, holding a ring.

MAX
Marry me, Annie.

Annie jumps into Max’s arms, laughing and kissing him. Bill
is still stinging from their insults.

BILL
(half-hearted)
Congrats. Happy for you guys.
--AT THEIR WEDDING RECEPTION, Max and Annie play a DANCING
VIDEO GAME in their tux and wedding dress. Dancing in
unison, as their score mounts. The SONG crescendos to...

TITLE UP: “GAME NIGHT”

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON a paper football about to be flicked at a finger-
goalpost.
ANNIE (0.S.)
Lotta pressure here. You miss, you
lose.

MAX (0.S.)

Stay outta my head, please.

Max and Annie sit in a doctor’s waiting room playing paper
football. Her hands are the goal. He’s about to “kick.”

MAX (CONT'D)
Y’know, you do have the advantage
because your fingers are smaller
than mine which means you have a
smaller goalpost.

ANNIE
Guess you should’ve married Uma
Thurman.

MAX

Guess I should’ve.

Max aims, but just as he’s about to flick the paper football
his PHONE PINGS an incoming text. The “football” flies
wildly far from the goal.

MAX (CONT'D)
Come on!

ANNIE
Awww. I’m sorry, honey. I know
how much this meant to you.

MAX
That was interference.

He reads the text. It’s from BROOKS: “PSYCHED FOR TONIGHT!”
The words are followed by the GIF of THE OBESE BOY DANCING
CRAZILY ON A SOFA.

Max sighs, annoyed.

A NURSE enters.

NURSE
Doctor Chin is ready for you.

INT. DR. CHIN’S OFFICE - DAY
Max and Annie sit across a desk from DR. JOHANNA CHIN, 40's.
DR. CHIN
.-.I think we've determined why

you've been having trouble
conceiving.
ANNIE
Oh, yeah?

Chin turns and looks at Max.

MAX
What? It’s me? Of course it’s me.

DR. CHIN
(opening a file)
I’m not loving your semen.

MAX
Oh?

DR. CHIN
Your count is excellent. But your
motility is well below normal.

MAX
What would cause that?

DR. CHIN
It can be genetic. Environmental
factors. Nine times out of ten
it’s just stress.

MAX
I’m not stressed.

DR. CHIN
Nothing at home or work?

MAX
No. It’s all good.

ANNIE
What about your brother?

MAX
What about him?

ANNIE
(to Dr. Chin)
His brother, Brooks, emailed a
couple months ago that he’s coming
into town this week. Max has
always had an inferiority complex
with him.

MAX
That’s not true. And she doesn’t
need to hear this. She’s not a
therapist.
DR. CHIN
No, but I am a doctor and I believe
in treating the whole patient.

ANNIE
He’s been on edge lately.

DR. CHIN
What is it about your brother that
intimidates you, Max?

MAX
Really? We’re gonna do this right
next to the room where I
masturbated?

ANNIE
Max has it in his head that Brooks
is more successful and better
looking and just generally cooler
than he is.

MAX
I never said “cooler.” Now you're
projecting.

ANNIE
(to Dr. Chin)
He’s just naturally charismatic.

DR. CHIN
(jots down some notes)
Very interesting. And is he
single?

MAX
Yeah. Why?

DR. CHIN
I don’t know if I mentioned it, but
Keith and I are on a trial
separation.

ANNIE
Oh, I’m sorry.

DR. CHIN
Don’t be. Keith was emotionally
abusive.
(then, to Max)
You think your brother would want
to grab a cup of coffee with me?

MAX
I-- I don’t know.
ANNIE
We can ask him.

DR. CHIN
Now, is he a tall fella? Because
I’m only 5'2”.

MAX
So we’re done with my sperm, then?

Annie and Dr. Chin ignore him.

ANNIE
He’s definitely taller than Max.
But he once dated this ballerina
and she was a tiny little thing--
y'know, I’m starting to love this
idea.

DR. CHIN
Me too. Is he Google-able?

Max throws up his hands as they continue to talk about how
great Brooks is.

EXT. MAX’S & ANNIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

Max and Annie pull into the driveway of a SUBURBAN HOME. Max
grabs some groceries from the trunk and they head toward the
door. They spot their stiff neighbor, GARY (40, think
Michael Shannon, wearing a police uniform) standing at his
mailbox. On a leash is a small, white puffball of a DOG.

MAX
(sotto, to Annie)
Shit. It’s Gary. Don’t mention
game night.

GARY
Good evening, Max. Annie.

ANNIE
Hey, Gary. How’s it going?

GARY
Well enough. Just checking the
mail. Some people check it earlier
in the day but there’s always a
risk that the mail carrier hasn’t
come yet. This spares me the
chance of a futile trip to the
mailbox.

ANNIE
Uh huh.
GARY
Plus, it allows Bastian here the
opportunity to urinate.

MAX
Well, have a good one.

GARY
(pointedly, glancing at
groceries)
Any plans for this evening?
Perhaps a game night?

MAX
(uneasy)
Oh, no. Annie and I are staying
in.
GARY

I see. I do hope you’1ll keep me in
mind for any future game nights. I
always enjoyed the camaraderie of
good friends competing in games of
chance and skill.

ANNIE
Yeah... we should do that again.
But tonight it’s just the two of

us.

GARY
Three bags of Tostitos “Scoops” I
notice.

They had a special. Three for one.

GARY
Three for one? How can that be
profitable for Frito-Lay?

 

They shrug.
GARY (CONT'D)
Well, you two enjoy each other.
Often we don’t fully appreciate
what we have until it’s gone.
Awkward beat.

MAX
Okay.

They can’t think of anything else to say so they head inside.
INT. KITCHEN - MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max and Annie enter. He peeks outside from behind a curtain.

ANNIE
Now if he sees the others we're
screwed.

MAX

Well, I told everyone to park far
away and sneak in quietly.

(then, changing course)
Are we being dicks? Should we just
keep inviting him? It seems like
he really wants to play.

ANNIE
No! Debbie was our friend. Gary
was just the creepy husband we had
to put up with. And he’s only
gotten worse since the divorce.
He’s like the butler at a haunted
house.

MAX
Yeah, you’re right. We don’t
actually owe him anything. He can
always find people like himself to
play with. Y'know, other weirdos.

Just then, a kitchen window opens and a VERY HOT 20-SOMETHING

GIRL, MADISON, crawls in. Max and Annie regard her.
ANNIE
Can we help you?
MADISON
(vocal fry)

I’m okay.
RYAN, 30’s, hoists himself in after her.

RYAN
Hey.

MAX
Why are you coming in the window?

RYAN
You said to sneak in so Robocop
wouldn’t see us.

MAX
I meant sneak in the door but,
okay... could you get your boot off
our cutting board?
10.

RYAN
Well, you were super vague about
how we should sneak in--

Just then, another window slides open and KEVIN, 30's
African-American, starts climbing inside.

ANNIE
Jesus. It’s like “Night of the
Living Dead” in here.

Kevin helps his wife, MICHELLE, 30's, African-American,
climb in.

MICHELLE
I am not dressed for this nonsense.
KEVIN
Yeah, you’re asking a lot of us,
Max.
MAX
I didn’t tell anyone to come in the
window.
RYAN

Guys, this is Madison. Madison,
this is Max and Annie. Kevin and
Michelle.

ANNIE
Yeah, you brought her last week.
(to Madison)
You work at Forever 21, right?

Ryan gives Annie a “what the fuck” look.

MADISON
(vocal fry)
I work at Sephora.

ANNIE
I’m confused.

MAX
(sotto to Annie)
Different girl. Same look, same
voice.

ANNIE
Oh. Hi. Nice to meet you.

MADISON
You too.
11.

Madison holds out an awkward limp hand, like a dead tish.
Max and Annie try to figure out what to do with it. Annie
shakes it awkwardly. Max kisses it.

MADISON (CONT'D)
Do you guys have a bathroom?

MAX
Yes we do. Right down the hall.

MADISON
On the right or the left. I don’t
want to go in the wrong room.

ANNIE
It’ll be the one with the toilet.
MADISON
‘Kay.
Madison exits.
MICHELLE
Where’d you meet her? At a TED
talk?
RYAN

Don’t judge me. Brains and
personality aren’t everything.

KEVIN
Aren't you sick of losing game
night every week ‘cause of the
dates you bring?

RYAN
They’re not always bad.

FLASHBACK TO:

--Ryan plays charades. He frantically mimes a clue for his
partner, HOT DATE #1. We REVEAL she isn’t paying any
attention to him. Instead she’s on SNAPCHAT, taking a
selfie with the “licking dog” filter. On it she’s written
“Game night. Bored AF.”

RYAN (CONT'D)
Come on, Heather! How many
pictures of you as a dog do you
need?

The others look embarrassed.

--Ryan’s HOT DATE #2 puts down a word in Scrabble and claps
happily.
12.

ANNIE
“Dennis” isn’t a word.
HOT DATE
Uh, yeah, it is. It’s my daddy’s

name, SO...
The group roll their eyes.

--Ryan and a HOT DATE #3 play Taboo. His card reads “Seal
Team Six.”

RYAN
Okay, these are, like, the very
best, the elite--

HOT BLONDE DATE
White people?

EVERYONE
Whoaaaa!

BACK TO SCENE.

RYAN
Unlike you psychos, I don’t really
give a shit about winning at game
night. I don’t need that
validation.

MICHELLE
But you do need the validation of
dating hot women.

RYAN

(matter of fact)
Oh yeah.

(then)
I’m sorry I’m not like you,
Michelle. We didn’t all meet our
soulmates when we were ten years
old.

Kevin smiles and puts an arm around Michelle.

KEVIN
Fourteen.

MICHELLE
We didn’t get married till we were
nineteen.

RYAN

And this was back in Iran? Or
Westeros?
They kiss.

13.

KEVIN
Y’know what, Ryan? I hope someday
you find a girl who you love as
much as I love my sweet baby here.

Ryan grimaces.

MAX
(heading to living room)
Everybody have a drink? What
should we play first?

RYAN
Y'know what rich people are doing
on their game nights these days?

ANNIE
What?

RYAN
Fight clubs. I just read about
them. They pay poor people to
fight each other and they bet on
the winner.

MICHELLE
That’s not a real thing.

RYAN
Yuh-huh. When you can have
anything you want in the world, you
have to raise the stakes or life
gets boring. The Kennedys used to
have fight clubs at their Hyannis
Port compound.

KEVIN
You need to stop reading Buzzfeed
every damn second of the day ‘cause
that’s just pure silliness.

MAX
So... charades then?

ANNIE
Don’t you want to wait for Brooks?

KEVIN
Hold up. Brooks is in town?

Madison returns.

MICHELLE
I thought he was working in Europe.
14.

MAX
He was. Apparently, he’s back here
for business. I haven’t seen him
yet.

MADISON
Who are we talking about?

RYAN
Max's brother. He’s this super-
successful venture capitalist.

KEVIN
He was the first to invest in
Panera Bread. Turned it into
America’s leading fast casual
dining chain.

RYAN
He’s the Mark Wahlberg to Max’s
Donnie.

MAX

Y’know what? I’m gonna take that
as a compliment because Donnie was
fucking great in “The Sixth Sense.”

MICHELLE
Was he in that?

MAX
Yeah, he was. And you know who
wasn’t? Mark Wahlberg.

MADISON
Mark would never take a role that
small.

MAX
Oh, he wouldn’t, Madison? Thank
you.

KEVIN

We haven't seen Brooks since your
wedding. Remember that speech he
gave?

MICHELLE
I’ve never seen you cry that much.

RYAN
We were all crying. What was that
lovely poem he read?

ANNIE
“Ancient Snapshots” by Joyce Carol
Oates.
15.

RYAN
That’s right. And then he paid for
that whole fireworks display.

There’s a beat as the friends fondly remember how awesome
Brooks is. Finally,

MAX
So, you guys wanna play or...?

SFX: HONK! HONK!

From outside the house, a loud CAR HORN is accompanied by the
blaring sound of BILLY JOEL’S “CAPTAIN JACK” on the radio.

Annie and Max hurry to the window.
Parked in front of their house, we see a shiny bright red

1976 Corvette Stingray with BROOKS at the wheel. He spots
them and gives a friendly wave.

ANNIE
You didn’t tell him to park up the
street?!

MAX

I did! Like three times!
(then, to himself)
He got a Stingray?

EXT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Max sneaks out the front door and tries to signal--

MAX
(whisper-yelling)
Turn off your car!

BROOKS
What’s that?

But it’s too late. Gary steps out his front door. Max waves
at Gary awkwardly, caught.

MAX
Hey again.
(under his breath)
Still wearing the uniform...

Brooks takes a 12-pack from his car and crosses the street.

BROOKS
(too loud)
Hey, bud. Sorry I’m late. I hope
you didn’t start game night without
me.
16.

MAX
(nodding toward Gary)
Shh! Didn’t you get my texts?

BROOKS
What texts?
(then, to Gary)
Evening, officer.
(then, softly)
What’s up with that guy?

MAX
(to Gary)
Gary, this is my brother. We’re
just doing, like, a little three-
man, family game night thing.

BROOKS
Three-man? What about Kevin,
Michelle and Ryan? I thought they
were coming.

MAX
No, no, no.
(to Gary)
Just us, Gary.
BROOKS
(pointing)

I can see them in your doorway.
There’s a whole mess of people.

REVERSE to see Kevin, Michelle, Annie, Ryan and Madison all
huddled in the doorway, hiding from Gary.

MAX
Huh? Oh, yeah.
(to Gary)
They’re not staying, Gary. It was
a mix-up with the...

Looking hurt, Gary goes back in his house and shuts the door.

MAX (CONT'D)
God damn it, Brooks.

BROOKS
What?

MAX
We didn’t want him to know we were
doing game night. He used to come
but we don’t like him anymore.

BROOKS
Well, now he knows. Bring it in.
I haven’t seen you in a year.
17.

Brooks grabs him in a bear hug.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
You smell good. What is that,
Selsun Blue? Head and Shoulders?

MAX
Why do you assume it’s dandruff
shampoo?

BROOKS

You've always been a bit of a
snowstorm. Now where’s that wife
of yours?

He heads inside.

INT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Everyone ad libs greetings as they exchange hugs with Brooks.

RYAN
Sweet ride, Brooks.

BROOKS
Oh yeah. I just got her a couple
weeks ago.

KEVIN
Is that a Corvette?

MAX
1976 rally red Stingray Coupe. It
was my dream car when I was a kid.

BROOKS
(innocently)
Yeah, that’s what gave me the idea
to get it.
(then)
I love your house.

MAX
Are you being sarcastic?

BROOKS
No. I mean it. It reminds me of
Mom and Dad's place. Takes me back
to simpler times.

MAX
Simpler?
ANNIE
(chill out)
Max.

(MORE)
18.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(then, to Brooks)
So, how long are you in town for?

BROOKS
Not sure. Depends on how many
clients my firm wants me to
schmooze. But I’m hoping it’s for
a while. I never get to see you
guys.

Brooks throws his arm around Max.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
I’ve missed you, man.

Max looks at his brother and can’t help it, he smiles--

MAX
Missed you too.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - LATER
They’re about to play CELEBRITY.

MADISON
Say it one more time.

RYAN
(a little impatient)
Okay. You take a piece of paper
from the bowl and then you give
clues to the group and they try and
guess who your celebrity is.

MADISON
Okay, got it.
MAX
Twenty seconds. Starting... now.

He starts a timer on his phone. Madison pulls out a name.

MADISON
I don’t know who this is.
MAX
That’s okay. Pick another one.
MADISON
(she does)

I don’t know who this is.

ANNIE
Try another one. Quick.
19.

MADISON
(she does)
Oh. Okay, this is the guy who--
no, wait. I don’t know who this
is.
RYAN
Maybe someone else should start.

The others quickly agree. Brooks gets up.

BROOKS
I’ll go.

Max rubs his palms on his pants. It’s on. Annie offers a
bottle of wine to Max.

ANNIE
Do you want more--

MAX
SHH!

Ryan starts the timer.

RYAN
And... go!

Brooks pulls out a clue.

BROOKS
(raspy singing)
“The beautiful people...”

MICHELLE
Marilyn Manson.

BROOKS
You got it.
(then, chuckling)
Quick story.

Brooks pauses the timer.

MAX
Hey, you can’t pause--

BROOKS
Remember that urban myth that
Marilyn Manson had some of his ribs
removed so he could go down on
himself?

KEVIN
Yeah?
20.

BROOKS
Can I tell ‘em, Max?

MAX
No! You’re in the middle of a--

BROOKS
Come on. You were 14. It’s an
adorable story.

MAX
I forbid it.

ANNIE
Now you’ve gotta tell us.

MAX
Thanks, honey.

RYAN
Did you blow yourself?

BROOKS
You know those bungee cords you use
on roof racks? Max wrapped one
behind his neck and under his legs
to try and squish his face down to
his crotch.

MICHELLE
Oh my god.

BROOKS

But he gets stuck like that. He
can’t unhook it. Finally, after
about an hour our mom comes home
and finds him there. This naked
pretzel boy on the floor of his
bedroom. He’s had back problems
ever since.

The group is equal parts shocked and cracking up. Max is

beet red.

Annie rubs his back, consoling.

ANNIE
Aww, my little pretzel boy.
RYAN
So?
MAX
So what?
RYAN

Did you suck it?
21.

MAX
We're not talking about this
anymore.

KEVIN

Come on! That’s like turning off
“Kramer vs. Kramer” before you see
who gets the kid.

MICHELLE
It’s really not.

A deeply embarrassed Max grabs the timer and starts it again.

MAX
Enough! The timer’s going.

BROOKS
Fine.

Brooks launches into A RAPID-FIRE SERIES OF CLUES that are so
spot-on, they are immediately guessed. He’s amazing.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
Poor man’s Johnny Depp stars in
“Jericho.”

ANNIE
Skeet Ulrich.

BROOKS
UN Secretary General from ‘92 to
196.

MICHELLE
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

BROOKS
Doesn’t like kids in “Jurassic
Park.”

KEVIN
Sam Neill.

BROOKS
Dubstep DJ looks like Corey
Feldman.

ANNIE
Skrillex.

ANGLE ON Madison. Like Ryan’s earlier date, she’s on
SNAPCHAT, taking a selfie with the “licking dog” filter.

BROOKS
Rappers are obsessed with this
Cubist painter.
22.

RYAN
Picasso.
BROOKS
Big cat shot by asshole dentist.
KEVIN
Cecil the lion!
MAX
Time!
RYAN
Whoa. Seven. That’s gonna be hard
to beat.
MAX

Not that hard. I’11 go next.
Brooks sits as Max steps up. Ryan starts the timer.

RYAN
Gol!

We see Max’s first celebrity on the paper: ED NORTON

MAX
Okay, easy. Annie, the actor we
met at the airport that time.

ANNIE
Who?

MAX
The only famous actor we ever met
at the airport!

ANNIE
Bobby Flay?

MAX
(increasingly flustered
He’s not an actor. He was in line
in front of us at Sbarro? We were
trying to figure out why he wasn’t
in the first class lounge.

ANNIE

Oh, yeah. Who was that...?
MAX

Goddamn it!
BROOKS

Y'know, you’ve got a whole room of
people here who can help out.
23.

MAX

Fine! He was the Incredible Hulk.
KEVIN

Eric Bana.

MAX
No! The other one.

MICHELLE
Mark Ruffalo.
MAX
The other one!
RYAN
Lou Ferrigno?
MAX
Shit! “Primal Fear.”
KEVIN
Richard Gere didn’t play the Hulk.
RYAN
Time's up.
MAX

Ed Fuckin’ Norton!

ANNIE
Ohh. Crap. Sorry.

Max does a bad job of covering how pissed he is.

RYAN
Zero points for Max. I’d say he
blew it, but he won’t tell us. Get
it?

 

Everyone but Max and Annie laughs.

INT. /EXT. MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - LATER
Max and Annie walk their guests out.

BROOKS
Hey, how about we do this next week
at my house?

MAX
House? What house?

BROOKS
Since I don’t know how long I’11l be
here, I rented a place.

(MORE )
24.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
It’s a couple miles away. Up on
Broadmoor.

RYAN
Ooh, swanky neighborhood.

BROOKS
It’s a cool place. But it’s pretty
empty with just me. It’d be fun to
have you guys over.

MAX
I don’t know. It’s kind of a
tradition to do game night here.

ANNIE
So what? Could be fun.

The others chime in with agreement.

BROOKS
Perfect.

MICHELLE
Can we bring anything?

BROOKS
No. I’ve got everything.
(beat)
Actually, Max, you may want to
bring your own bungee cord.

They all crack up.

MAX
Just gonna keep going back to that
well, huh?

BROOKS
I’m sorry. I’m done.
(then)
I promise you guys: this will be a
game night to remember.

He hugs Max and gets into his Stingray. Max looks on with a
hint of envy, then shuts the door and begins helping Annie
clean up.

MAX
Jackass.

ANNIE
He’s just trying to get under your
skin.
25.

MAX
Yeah, and he knows exactly how to
do it. He’s been doing it my whole
life. I don’t see him for a year,
then he pulls up in MY dream car,
insults our house and tells an
embarrassing story about me right
before my turn.

ANNIE
Buying the same car does seem like
a bit of a “fuck you.” But maybe
it was his dream car too.

MAX
Bullshit. He’s always known how to
undermine me. You know I’ve never
won a game against him?

ANNIE
Well, you’ve got to stop letting it
bother you. It’s literally killing
our baby.

MAX
What am I supposed to do?

ANNIE
I don’t know. Beat him?

Max considers this. It’s a damn good idea.

CUT TO BLACK.

CHYRON: “ONE WEEK LATER”

EXT. MAX & ANNIE’S HOUSE - DUSK
Max and Annie head out toward his car with some board games.

ANNIE
You don’t want to just Uber there?

MAX
I’m not getting drunk tonight. I’m
gonna be sharp and ready for--

GARY (0.S.)
Evening.

They both jump and turn to see Gary standing there in the
dark, as always in his police uniform, holding his dog.

MAX ANNIE
Jesus, Gary! AHH!!
26.

They hide the board games.

GARY
Where you headed?

MAX
Just going to my brother’s.

GARY
Another game night?

MAX
No! No game night. Just dinner.

GARY
I see. Pity. I was going to
invite you over for a dinner I was
hosting. I’ve purchased four lamb
shanks. I’m simmering them in a
broth of red wine and rosemary.

ANNIE
That sounds yummy.

MAX
Yeah, it’s too bad we have plans.

GARY
It was Debbie’s recipe. I like to
think she left me her recipe cards
as a gesture of goodwill. But most
likely it was an unintentional
oversight.

MAX
Uh huh. We should get going.

GARY
Have fun.

Freaked out, Max and Annie head for the car. After a beat,

GARY (CONT'D)
What?

ANNIE
We didn’t say anything.

GARY
Oh. Okay.

Gary stands there watching as they get into the car.

EXT. BROOKS’ HOUSE/INT. CAR - NIGHT

Max's car pulls up to a beautiful modern mansion.
27.

MAX
Aw, fuck me.

ANNIE
Guy who rents a house this big has
to be covering up for something
small.

MAX
No, I’ve seen his dick. It’s
pretty great.

ANNIE
Well, I tried.

INT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Brooks opens the door on Max and Annie. The place is all
windows and technology. It’s annoyingly tasteful and
awesome. Brooks offers them glasses of champagne.

BROOKS
Hey, guys.

MAX
Hey. Nice house, Tony Stark.
Should we give our drink orders to
Jarvis?

BROOKS
Ha! I got the Tony Stark part but
then you went full nerd and I lost
you. Come on in.

They follow him into a beautiful living room where Kevin,
Michelle and Ryan are having a drink with JILLIAN, a bright,
cute girl who seems way more normal than Ryan’s usual dates.

Ryan proudly presents Jillian like a prize--

RYAN
Oh, hello friends. Allow me to
introduce you to my date, Jillian.
Jillian went to Yale University and
is a software engineer at our
office, so she’s smart as shit,
okay?

Kevin and Michelle exchange a look.

JILLIAN
Okay, that was weird.
(to Max and Annie)
Nice to meet you guys.
28.

ANNIE
(they shake)
You too.

Ryan flips Max and Annie off from behind Jillian’s back.

RYAN
So maybe you can’t always judge a
book by its past... covers.

MAX
Odd use of that phrase.
(to Brooks)
We didn’t know what games you had,
so we brought a few of our
favorites.

BROOKS
Oh, cool. Thanks, guys.

Brooks takes the games and THROWS THEM ACROSS THE ROOM.
Pieces skitter across the stone floor.

MAX
What the hell?

BROOKS
I told you we're taking it up a
notch. The game we’re playing is
so epic, it doesn’t need a board or
pieces.

MAX
Still, you didn’t need to throw
them across the room.

BROOKS
I was being theatrical.

RYAN
Holy shit. Are we doing a fight
club?

BROOKS
What?

RYAN
These super-rich guys pay poor
people--

KEVIN

No. Enough with the fight clubs.
It’s nonsense.

ANNIE
So what are we playing?
29.

BROOKS
(dramatic)
In your drinks I’ve placed a
powerful neurotoxin. You have
eight hours to find the antidote
hidden somewhere in the city.

They all exchange looks of disbelief.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
I’m just fucking with you. But
this is not a joke: in the next
hour, someone in this room will be
taken. It’ll be up to you to find
that person before they're
murdered.

KEVIN
(excited)
Is this a murder mystery party?!

BROOKS
Not just any murder mystery party.
I found this company that does it
super-real with legit actors. You
won’t know what’s real and what’s
fake. Cost me a shit-ton.

MICHELLE
Fun!

BROOKS
But wait. There’s more. Whoever
finds the victim wins the grand
prize: the keys to the Stingray.

RYAN

Just the keys?
BROOKS

No, Ryan. The whole car.
KEVIN

Holy shit!
RYAN

Yes!

(to Jillian)

You’re so lucky I brought you to
this game night and not one of Max
and Annie's.

ANNIE
Hey.
30.

RYAN
No, I just mean because this is
better.

MAX

Come on, Brooks. You’re not
actually gonna give away your car.

BROOKS
I need a write-off. Plus, my Audi
is more practical.

MICHELLE
This is the best night ever.

JILLIAN
So what do we do now?

BROOKS

Now we wait. Maybe play a little
drinking game to pass the time.

MAX
We don’t play drinking games.

BROOKS
Tonight we do.
KEVIN
How about “Never Have I Ever”?
RYAN
Good one.
MAX

(sotto, to Annie)
Is this all just to one-up us?

ANNIE
Maybe he’s trying to show us a good
time.

MAX

No, that’s not it.

Annie rolls her eyes. Max heads off to the bathroom.

EXT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

A menacing BLACK VAN quietly pulls up and parks outside.

INT. BLACK VAN - NIGHT

Two men sit inside -- a scary-looking, squat BALD GUY (40s)
and a wiry creepy guy with a PONYTAIL (40s).
31.

PONYTAIL
This the place?

The Bald Guy pulls out a scrap of paper with an address
scribbled on it -- 1765 Broadmoor Avenue.

BALD GUY
This is it.

Ponytail dials his cell phone.

PONYTAIL
(into phone)
We’re at the house. Looks like
they’re all inside.

Bald Guy takes out a photo of Brooks. Then Ponytail hands
him A VERY REAL-LOOKING GUN.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Max exits the bathroom and hears a CLATTERING NOISE from the
kitchen. Curious, he slowly makes his way down the hall...

Just as he turns the corner he finds himself INCHES AWAY FROM
THE BLADE OF A LARGE KNIFE!

MAX
Fucking shit!

Terrified, Max scrambles back against the wall. REVEAL it’s
Brooks holding the knife. Max exhales.

BROOKS
(laughing)
What the hell’s wrong with you?
(re: the knife)
It’s for the cheese.

MAX
You sure you don’t need a bigger
one? Are we cutting a whole wheel
of gouda?

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Max and Brooks return. Everyone plays the drinking game.

JILLIAN
Never have I ever connected my work
computer to a projector in the
conference room while it was open
to a WebMD page on chlamydia
symptoms.
32.

RYAN
Dude! Not cool.

Everyone laughs.

JILLIAN
(grinning)
Drink.
He drinks.
RYAN

For the record. I didn’t have
chlamydia. It was a pubic
dermatitis.

KEVIN
Nasty.

ANNIE
(quietly, to Ryan)
I like her....
(then, to Jillian)
I like you.

RYAN
You're not supposed to target
people with this game. It’s
supposed to be generic things,
like... never have I ever slept
with a celebrity.

The others nod. Without thinking, Michelle take a sip of her
drink. Halfway through the sip, she realizes Kevin is
staring at her in surprise. She sets down her glass.

MICHELLE
What?

KEVIN
You've slept with a celebrity?

MICHELLE
Hmm? No, no. I was just taking a
drink separate from the game.

KEVIN
Why are you all nervous then?

MICHELLE
(nervous )
I’m not nervous. Who’s turn is it?

ANNIE
I think it’s Max’s turn. It’s
somebody’s turn. Somebody should
go now.
33.

JILLIAN
(to Ryan)
What’s going on here?
RYAN
(sotto)
They’ve been together since middle
school.
JILLIAN
Uh oh.
KEVIN

How could you possibly have had sex
with a celebrity when we've only
had sex with each other?

MICHELLE
You're making this into something
it’s not.

Max turns to Brooks.

MAX
This is why we don’t play drinking
games.

SFX: BANG! BANG! BANG!

Everyone jumps at the sound of banging. They all look at the
front door except for Kevin who stares at Michelle.

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Open up!

BROOKS
Looks like the game is afoot.

He crosses to the door and opens it on an imposing, extremely
serious 40-something MAN in a dark suit and sunglasses.

MAN
Are you Brooks Davis?

BROOKS
(mock serious)
I am.

MAN
I’m Agent Henderson. FBI. Please
sit down.

Brooks joins the others as the man enters.
RYAN

Sunglasses at night. This guy’s
the real deal.
34.

AGENT HENDERSON
I'll get right to the point. The
Bureau has been tracking a ring of
violent kidnappers in this
neighborhood. We have reason to
believe that one of you may be
their next victim.

MAX
Quick question, Agent Henderson?
Why is this a federal
investigation? Seems more like a
local police matter.

Annie swats Max: “play along.” Agent Henderson glares at Max
but says nothing. He hands each of them a folder.

AGENT HENDERSON
Contained in these dossiers are the
clues you’ll need to find the
kidnappers.

MAX
We have to find them? What’s the
Bureau’s role in this?

KEVIN
Maybe the FBI can take my wife in
for questioning. ‘Cause

apparently, she’s got a whole
secret life I don’t know anything

about.
MICHELLE
Honey--
AGENT HENDERSON
(barking)
Shut up! All of you! This isn’t a
joke!

He gets up in Max’s face.

AGENT HENDERSON (CONT'D)
(intense)
You people are in serious danger
and we are running out of time
here! I will not stand idly by and
see more civilians slaughtered on
my watch!

Max glances over at Brooks and gives him a grudgingly
impressed look.

BROOKS
He’s pretty good, huh?
35.

AGENT HENDERSON
Now, before we get started I’m
required to ask if anyone here has
any food allergies--

BOOM!!! The FRONT DOOR IS KICKED OPEN, splintering off its
hinges. Bald Guy and Ponytail walk in wearing ski masks.

AGENT HENDERSON (CONT'D)
Who the hell are you?

Ponytail COLD COCKS the “FBI Agent.” He goes down hard.

BROOKS
Guys! I know you’re “method” and
all but you can’t just break my
door--

Bald Guy walks up to Brooks and PUNCHES HIM IN THE GUT.
Brooks doubles over.

MAX
Okay, I actually don’t mind this
game.

Brooks shoves the guy away.

BROOKS
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

Ponytail grabs Brooks in a headlock from behind. Brooks
backs up, slamming Ponytail into the wall.

JILLIAN
Wow. This is kind of intense...

The fight continues. It’s SLOPPY AND SURPRISINGLY VIOLENT as
Brooks does a decent job of defending himself.

ANGLE ON the rest of the group sitting on the sofas calmly
eating chips and drinking cocktails like they’re watching a
movie.

ANNIE
(to Max)
This is very well done.

MAX
Hm. Ski masks are a little on the
nose.

Ponytail is shoved onto the coffee table in front of them.
Ryan plucks the champagne bottle out of his way in the nick
of time.

Brooks manages to get loose from the Bald Guy. He reaches
down to his ankle and pulls out a SMALL HANDGUN.
36.

RYAN
(playful)
Watch out. He’s packin’ heat!

Brooks aims the gun at Bald Guy but it’s knocked out of his
hand by Ponytail. The gun skitters across the room and comes
to a stop at Annie’s feet. She looks down at it.

The fight spills out of the living room and into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - BROOKS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Brooks faces off against the two attackers, wielding pots,
utensils and whatever he can grab as a weapon. It’s like a
Bourne movie except these guys are not nearly as coordinated.

INT. LIVING ROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE
The group are as we left them. We can hear the sounds of

breaking glass, clattering pans and pained grunts coming from
the kitchen. After a beat, Max slices a sliver of cheese.

MAX
This is good.

ANNIE
Try it with the prosciutto.

JILLIAN
Are we sure this is all part of the
thing?

RYAN
Oh, yeah. Brooks always goes all-
out.

(to the group)
Remember that fireworks display he
got for their wedding--?

MAX
(abruptly)
Yeah, Ryan. We talked about that.

Suddenly, Brooks flies into the room, landing on his back.
There’s broken glass in his hair and he’s got a bloody nose.

MICHELLE
Ooh, they put some makeup on him.

BROOKS
Help me! Please! This isn’t--

Bald Guy pins Brooks down and SLAPS TAPE over his mouth.
37.

MAX
(slow clapping)
Very impressive. And the
Independent Spirit Award goes to...

Brooks tries to buck Bald Guy off of him. Ponytail takes his
gun out of his belt and points it at Brooks.

PONYTAIL
Stop fighting, asshole!

Bald Guy pulls out a bag and puts it over Brooks’ head. He
and Ponytail drag the struggling Brooks out of the house.

Bald Guy stops at the door and points his gun at the gang--

BALD GUY
First one that follows us out, I
shoot in the face.

MAX
M'kay, drive safe.

The men hustle Brooks out. There’s a beat as the group
continue to sip their drinks.

KEVIN
There’s something about this that
doesn’t make sense.
(to Michelle)
What did I do that made you want to
cheat on me with a celebrity?!

MICHELLE
I didn’t cheat on you. It was
before we got married. When we
took that break.

KEVIN
Oh my god. My world is collapsing.

As Kevin and Michelle bicker, Ryan crosses to the supine “FBI
Agent” and nudges him with his foot.

RYAN
Agent Henderson? You gonna keep
lying there?

He doesn’t move.

RYAN (CONT'D)
(to Jillian)
He’s a regular Daniel Day Lewis.

Meanwhile, Max discreetly grabs one of the dossiers and he
and Annie scurry off to another room. Jillian notices. She
holds up another dossier to Ryan. They hurry off as well.
38.

KEVIN
(to Michelle)
...we both agreed we wouldn’t hook
up with anyone during that break.

MICHELLE
Yeah, but then you went and got a
handjob from Karen Waller.

KEVIN
It was over the pants! And I felt
guilty the whole time. But I guess
I shouldn’t have.

MICHELLE
You're making this into something--
(then noticing)
Oh hell. They got the jump on us.

KEVIN
grabs dossier)
Come on! But this isn’t over.
They hurry out.
IN QUICK CUTS:
--IN THE KITCHEN, Max and Annie go over the dossier:
MAX
Here's the first clue. It looks
like a riddle.
(reads )
With shiny fangs...
--IN A BEDROOM, Ryan and Jillian read the rules:
JILLIAN
(reads )
..-my bloodless bite...
--IN A HALLWAY, Michelle reads:
MICHELLE
.+-eWill bring together what’s
mostly white.

KEVIN
Donald Trump!

MICHELLE
I don’t think that’s it.

KEVIN
How do you know? Did you fuck him?

--IN THE KITCHEN--
39.

ANNIE
“Bloodless bite”? So it’s not a
vampire. Let me Google this.

She takes out her phone.

MAX
This is so inconsistent. They
choreograph a super-realistic fight
and then they give us an FBI
dossier with riddles in it? Pick a
tone and stick with it.

ANNIE
Do you want that car or not?

MAX

More than anything ever. But I
feel like Brooks is setting me up
here. This is just another game
where somehow he’s gonna humiliate
me.

(then)
I say we find a shortcut.

ANNIE
How do we do that?

Max notices her phone.
MAX
His phone! It was in his pocket
when they grabbed him.

ANNIE
You want to call him?

MAX
I want to track him.

He points to Brooks’ iPad lying on the kitchen counter. They
give each other an excited look.
INT. BEDROOM - BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

Ryan and Jillian are studying the dossier.

RYAN
“Bloodless bite... bloodless
bite... bloodless bite...”
JILLIAN

Maybe stop saying “bloodless bite”
so I can think?
40.

They hear a CAR DOOR SLAM out the window. They glance out to
see Max and Annie getting in their car and backing out of the

driveway.

She spots

She finds

RYAN
Shit. They must've already figured
it out. We’ve gotta up our game.
There’s nothing more dangerous than
Max when he’s got something to

prove.
(then)
“Bloodless bite... bloodless
bite...”
JILLIAN
Stop that!
(then)

We need to find an advantage.
a wallet on the bedside table and picks it up.

RYAN
Brooks’ wallet? You think we
should just steal all his shit?

JILLIAN
No.

Brooks’ credit card and dials a number on her cell.

JILLIAN (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Yes, hi. I lost my credit card and
I’m wondering if you can tell me
the last few charges I made?

RYAN
What are you doing?

JILLIAN
(covering phone)
If we can find the name of the
murder mystery company he used we
can go to their office and pay them
off to give us the final clue.

RYAN
Whoa. You are a double threat:
brains and sneakiness.

JILLIAN
(not exactly flattered)
Thanks.
4l.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Kevin and Michelle are still puzzling over the clue.

KEVIN
What has shiny fangs that bites
white things together?

MICHELLE
(getting it)
A stapler! The white things are
paper!

KEVIN
Yes! I would kiss you but I don’t
know where those lips have been.

She rolls her eyes.

MICHELLE
Look around for a stapler.

They move down the hall and enter

INT. BROOKS’ STUDY - CONTINUOUS

A windowless room with a skylight in the ceiling. Lots of
bound books, a desk, etc.

KEVIN
Found one!

He grabs a stapler off the desk and opens it. Inside is a
FLASHDRIVE.

MICHELLE
Here. Put it in the desktop.

Kevin plugs it into the computer and a text box opens.

KEVIN
Another riddle.

MICHELLE

(reads)
“I am brown and old by day, white
and young by night, my eyes are
glass, I have nine faces but no
head. I sing to the sky but I have
no voice. I am everywhere and
nowhere--”

KEVIN
What the fuck is that?!
42.

INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT
Annie drives while Max uses FIND MY IPHONE on Brooks’ iPad--

ANNIE
Are they still on Route 18?

MAX
Yup. We’re catching up.

ANNIE
Can you imagine Brooks’ face when
we find him so fast?

MAX
It’s gonna be so good. Y’‘know, I
think I can actually feel my sperm
coming back to life.

ANNIE

Perfect. We'll win your brother's
car and then go make a baby in it.

MAX
Yeah! And we'll make him watch us!

ANNIE

What? I don’t want to do that.
MAX

I don’t either. I don’t know why I

said that.

INT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jillian finishes her call.

JILLIAN
(into phone)
Great. Thank you.
(hangs up)
Let’s go. I got the game company’s
name and address.

RYAN
Yes! You rock.

He goes to hug her. Expecting a high-five, she puts up a
hand. It’s awkward. He ends up hugging her hand.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ryan and Jillian head toward the living room. They pass the
study where Michelle and Kevin are. Ryan stops.
43.

RYAN
Hey, guys, just wanted to wish you
the best of luck tonight.

Kevin and Michelle look at him quizzically as he shuts the
door to the study and PROPS A CHAIR UNDER THE HANDLE.

JILLIAN
What are you doing?

RYAN
Oh, being a dick.

He heads out. She follows.

INT. BROOKS’ STUDY - CONTINUOUS
Kevin tries the door but it won't budge.

KEVIN
That son of a bitch.
(calling through door)
You son of a bitch!

He throws his shoulder against the door. Nothing. He spots
some candles on a shelf.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
Hand me those matches. I’m gonna
burn down this door.

MICHELLE
You’re gonna light a fire ina
windowless room that we’re trapped

in?
KEVIN
_ (pouty)
Fine. Don’t hand me the matches.
MICHELLE
(looking up)

What about that?
He looks up to see a SKYLIGHT twelve feet overhead. His eyes
narrow.
INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT

CLOSE ON an iPad screen. The BLIP of Brooks’ phone stops
moving, then disappears.

MAX
Hold on. Brooks’ phone just
disappeared.
44,

ANNIE
Crap. Where did you last see it?

MAX
Corner of 5th and Kenmore.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

They pull into a deserted lot in a sketchy neighborhood.
They get out of the car and look around.

ANNIE
Where could he be?

Max notices a dumpster that sits behind an unmarked building.
He crosses to it and glances in. Inside he spots a cell
phone. He retrieves it.

MAX
Found it. It’s turned off.
ANNIE
He must’ve known we were tracking
him.
MAX
Damn it. They outsmarted us.
(noticing)
Hang on...

He points across the street to where Ponytail is finishing a
cigarette outside of a dive bar. He heads back inside.

ANNIE

Isn’t that one of the actors?
MAX

Yeah. I guess they’re not that

smart.
They high-five each other.

ANNIE
We are nailing this! Come on!

They head across the street, instinctively staying low.

MAX
Why are we crouching?

ANNIE
I don’t know. Feels right?
45.

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Max and Annie enter, trying to look casual. There’s a BURLY
BARTENDER, a half-asleep DRUNK GUY, and in a corner booth,
facing away from them is Ponytail.

MAX
(sotto, re: Ponytail)
There he is. Don’t let him see
you.

They take a seat at the bar. Max signals to the tattooed
bartender.

MAX (CONT'D)
Sir? You wouldn’t happen to have
seen a guy brought in here. Looks
a bit like me with a stronger chin,
higher cheekbones.

BARTENDER
So, a better looking guy?

MAX
Okay, well, that’s not necessarily--

Annie gives the bartender a look to say “kind of, yes.”

BARTENDER
I didn’t see nothing.

He moves off. Max’s eyes narrow.

MAX
“Didn't see nothing”? That double-
negative felt a bit forced, huh?

ANNIE
I bet he’s in on it. Look at how
fresh his tats are. Probably fake.

MAX
Let’s test him. We’ll order drinks
only a real bartender would know
how to make.

ANNIE
Smart.
(calling)
Barkeep?
BARTENDER
Yeah?
ANNIE

Can I have a vodka tonic, please?
46.

MAX
Really?

ANNIE
I choked.

MAX

(to Bartender)
I’ll take a Harvey Wallbanger.

The bartender looks at him, annoyed. Then goes to make the
drinks.

ANNIE
This is kinda fun, isn’t it?

MAX
Yeah. It is nice to get out of the
house. Y’know, we won’t be able to
do this kind of thing when we have
a kid.

ANNIE
Why not?

MAX
‘Cause when you have a kid, you
stop living for you and you start
living for them. That’s why Brooks
has got it made.

ANNIE
So, what are you saying?

Max just shrugs as the bartender sets down their drinks.

BARTENDER
Vodka tonic. Harvey Wallbanger.

Max takes a sip.

ANNIE
Did he get it right?

MAX
I don’t know. I realize I’ve never
actually had one. But it’s tasty.
Tart.

Suddenly, Max reacts as Bald Guy exits a back room, locks it,

 

then tosses the keys to the Bartender. Behind him, we catch
a brief glimpse of a man tied to a chair. It’s Brooks.

 

MAX (CONT'D)
Holy shit. Brooks is back there.
We’re about to win this thing!
47.

Bald Guy has crossed over to Ponytail. He has noticed Max
and Annie and he’s pointing them out to Ponytail.

ANNIE
Uh oh. They made us.

MAX
You think they’re gonna try and
stop us?

ANNIE
We already know they take their
roles pretty seriously. But the
good news is, so do I.

She reaches into her purse and pulls out the GUN BROOKS
DROPPED EARLIER.

MAX
What the-- where did you get that?!

ANNIE
It’s the fake gun Brooks “dropped”
in the fight.

MAX
How do you know it’s fake?

ANNIE
You think your brother would use a
real gun in a fake fight with
actors he hired?

MAX
Good point. So, what are we gonna
do?

ANNIE

Follow my lead.
She gets to her feet and points the gun at the men.

ANNIE (CONT'D)

(shouting)
Any of you fucking pricks move, and
I'll execute every motherfuckin'
last one of you!

MAX
“Pulp Fiction.” Nice.
PONYTAIL

What the fuck is this?

MAX
Hand over the keys. We’re taking
my brother.
48.

BALD GUY
Bullshit.

Caught up in her role, Annie gets closer to Bald Guy and aims
her gun right at him.

ANNIE
You know what’s bullshit? Your
bald fucking head.

MAX
Getting a little personal, hon.

ANNIE

(“angrily” to Bald Guy)
I’m sorry I called you bald! It
works on you because you have a
very symmetrical face!

(then)
Okay, all of you. On your knees.
Eyes shut. Hands in the air.
Heads on the floor.

The thugs try to comply but can’t remember everything. They
all assume different positions.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I said hands in the air.

PONYTAIL
Where’s my head go?

ANNIE
On the floor! And close your eyes.

BARTENDER
How do I put my hands in the air
with my head on the floor?

MAX
I had the same question.

ANNIE
Okay, child's pose. You guys know
child’s pose?

They give her blank looks. She hands the gun to Max.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Cover me.

(then, to the men)
It’s like this...

She gets on the floor and demonstrates the position. The men
follow suit.
49,

ANNIE (CONT'D)
If you’re doing it right, you’ll
feel your lumbar really opening up.

Bald Guy gives Max a look of disbelief. Max just shrugs.

EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT

Ryan and Jillian step out of his car and head toward a small
storefront -- the party planning company, “Murder We Wrote.”

RYAN
There it is!

JILLIAN
Looks like they’re still open.

RYAN
I am so glad I invited you tonight.
I usually bring these girls I want
to sleep with and they always suck.
You're a breath of fresh air.

JILLIAN
(annoyed)
Oh, nice. I usually go out with
guys who are interesting and smart.
So this is a first for me too.

RYAN
Are we cool? Did I say something
wrong?

JILLIAN

No. I guess I didn’t realize when
you invited me tonight that it was
just because you needed a ringer.

RYAN
Ohh. You thought this was a date.

JILLIAN
It's fine. The more I get to know
you, the happier I am that it’s
not.

RYAN
(oblivious )
So we are cool?

JILLIAN
As a cucumber. Let’s just win that
car and get this night over with.

RYAN
That’s the spirit!
50.

He jogs toward the entrance. She shakes her head.

INT. “MURDER WE WROTE” OFFICE - NIGHT

Ryan and Jillian enter a small reception area. Behind a desk
a WOMAN sits facing away from us in a swivel chair.

JILLIAN
Hello?

No answer. She and Ryan exchange a look. Ryan slowly
reaches out and swivels the chair around revealing...

A DEAD WOMAN WITH A FRESH BULLET HOLE IN HER FOREHEAD. Her
eyes are closed. Blood trickles from the wound and the
corner of her mouth.

RYAN/JILLIAN
Holy shit!/Ahhh!

Startled by the noise, the dead woman SUDDENLY OPENS HER
EYES.

RECEPTIONIST
Oh my gosh! You scared me.

RYAN
What the fuck is this?!

RECEPTIONIST

What?

(remembering, touches her

forehead)
Oh. I just came from a six hour
murder mystery where I played the
corpse. I guess I fell asleep
before I cleaned up.

JILLIAN
You scared the shit out of us.

RECEPTIONIST
Oh, thank you. I do my own makeup.
How can I help you?

A bit of blood dribbles from her mouth.

RYAN
We need you to give us the final
clue for the murder mystery Brooks
Davis ordered.

RECEPTIONIST
But that would ruin the fun.
51.

JILLIAN
We don’t want the fun. We just
want to win.

RECEPTIONIST
I can’t do that.

RYAN
(sly) .
Would this change your mind?

He slides a bill across the desk. It’s a ten dollar bill.

RECEPTIONIST
No.

RYAN
What about this?

He slides another bill across. It’s a five. She looks at
him unimpressed.

RYAN (CONT'D)
You drive a hard bargain. Okay,
let's take it up a notch.

He slides another bill. It’s a one. The Receptionist looks
at Jillian. Jillian shakes her head: “Don’t look at me.”

RYAN (CONT'D)
I was hoping I wasn’t going to have
to dig this deep.

He goes back into his wallet. Considers for a beat, then
reluctantly slides another bill over. It’s another one
dollar bill.

JILLIAN
Okay, y’know what? It doesn’t
matter how slowly you push it over.
It’s still seventeen dollars.
(to Receptionist)
How much do you need?

RECEPTIONIST
A hundred?

JILLIAN
Give her a hundred.

RYAN
Fine.

He slowly slides all the bills back toward himself, then
slides a hundred dollar bill toward the woman. She reaches
into a drawer and hands a folded clue across the desk to
them.
52.

RYAN (CONT'D)
(to Jillian)
And that’s how we do.

INT. BROOKS’ STUDY - NIGHT

Michelle watches nervously as Kevin finishes building a tower
of furniture, books and office equipment up to the skylight.

KEVIN
Just tell me who it was.

MICHELLE
It’s irrelevant.

KEVIN
Not to me. If I have to imagine
you lying underneath some famous
figure, it makes a very big
difference if I’m imagining John
Goodman or Jeremy Renner.

MICHELLE
It wasn’t either of them.
KEVIN
Will you tell me if I guess it
right?
MICHELLE
Fine.
KEVIN

Was it an actor?

MICHELLE
Yes.

Kevin starts to carefully climb up his pile.

MICHELLE (CONT'D)
This is a bad idea.

KEVIN
Over 40?

MICHELLE
Yes. Be careful.

KEVIN
American?

MICHELLE

Yes.
KEVIN
Tommy Lee Jones?
MICHELLE
Ew. No.
KEVIN
Was it Denzel? Tell me it wasn’t
Denzel.
MICHELLE

It wasn’t. Unfortunately.

53.

Kevin has reached the ceiling. He unlatches the skylight and
pushes it open. He takes a breath of outside air.

KEVIN
Ahhh! Sweet freedom. Dipshit
thought he could keep us locked up
but we found a way out.

The tower suddenly TIPS OVER. Kevin screams as
across the room. He SLAMS INTO THE LOCKED DOOR
impact smashes it open.

MICHELLE
Are you okay?!

Kevin painfully gets to his feet.
KEVIN
What the fuck just happened?
(realizing)
Hey, we’re out. Come on!

Michelle follows him out.

INT. BROOKS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

he falls
and the

Kevin and Michelle enter to find “Agent Henderson” sitting on

the floor touching a cut on his head.
AGENT HENDERSON
(woozy)
Where am I? Stay back!

KEVIN
All right, take it easy, bud.

AGENT HENDERSON

Oh, my head.

MICHELLE
Either give us a clue or get outta
the way. ‘Cause we’ve got a

mystery to solve.
54.

AGENT HENDERSON
(intense)
Don’t you get it? That wasn’t
supposed to happen!

CRASH! Once again the front door is kicked open and TWO MEN
enter wearing creepy clown masks. Michelle and Kevin jump.

MICHELLE
What now? You already did the
breaking in thing.

KEVIN
This is some lazy writing.
CLOWN #1
Shut up! Get on the floor, all of

you!
The clowns notice Agent Henderson’s injury.

CLOWN #2
Whoa. Ron. Are you okay?

The clowns pull off their masks revealing the faces of two
actors.

AGENT HENDERSON/RON
No, I’m not okay! Two guys came in
here and attacked me!

CLOWN #1
You mean for real?

AGENT HENDERSON/RON
Yes! They weren’t part of our
cast.

CLOWN #2
Oh my god.

AGENT HENDERSON/RON
I knew I shouldn’t have left dinner
theater for this bullshit.

KEVIN
(to Michelle)
Now it’s getting meta.

CLOWN #1
(dialing cell phone)
I’m calling Glenda.

CLOWN #2
I’1ll go make you a cold compress,
Ron.
55.

AGENT HENDERSON/ RON
I think I may have a concussion.

CLOWN #1
(rubbing his back)
Aw, pal.
MICHELLE

Wait. Is this all part of the act?

AGENT HENDERSON/RON
What?! No. Didn’t you see? I was
assaulted!

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. “MURDER WE WROTE” OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Jillian and Ryan puzzle over the clue.

RYAN
(reading)
“Look in your jacket pocket”? What
kind of clue is this? I don’t even
have a jacket.

JILLIAN
Maybe it means a book jacket?

RYAN
Why would a book have a jacket?

The phone on the receptionist’s (GLENDA) desk rings. She
answers.

RECEPTIONIST/GLENDA
Murder We Wrote.

CLOWN #1
Glenda! It’s Paul. Something
terrible has happened.

RECEPTIONIST/GLENDA
Oh dear. What?

CLOWN #1
Nathan and I showed up for the
takeaway and Ron had been attacked.

RECEPTIONIST/GLENDA
Oh no! At the Brooks Davis house?

Jillian and Ryan look up.

RYAN
Huh?
56.

Glenda puts the call on speaker.

RECEPTIONIST/GLENDA
Is everyone okay?

RON
(yelling at the phone)
No, I’m not okay Glenda! I’ve got
a throbbing headache! And they
took the host!

RECEPTIONIST/GLENDA
Who took him?

AGENT HENDERSON/RON
Kidnappers! Real ones! Dangerous
fucking criminals!

Off Kevin and Michelle’s and Ryan and Jillian’s look of
shock, we return to

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
MUSIC CUE: “TAKE ON ME” by a-ha

The upbeat music blares from a jukebox as Max frisks the men.
Annie dances to the music, twirling the gun on her finger.
She drops it and it lands inches from Ponytail. Annie
quickly snatches it back.

ANNIE
I saw you eyeing that, Ponytail.
Not on my watch.

Max finishes collecting the weapons from the men and sticking
them in a bag. He finds keys on the bartender.

MAX

Bingo.
(to Annie)
Come on, babe.

He moves to the backroom door and unlocks it.
ANNIE
Okay, any of you dickwalls move a
muscle I’1l shoot off your tits.
You got me?

The men grumble. Annie’s phone rings. She checks it. It’s
Michelle. She hits “ignore.”

Max and Annie enter the backroom and shut the door.
57.

INT. BACKROOM - CONTINUOUS

They quickly lock the door behind them and turn to Brooks,
who is tied to a chair and gagged with tape. His eyes go
wide when he sees them.

MAX
Oh, look at that face. That is
priceless.

ANNIE
You did not expect us this early,
did you?

Brooks frantically grunts and tries to scream through his
gag.

MAX
I’ve gotta capture this moment.

He takes out his phone, poses beside Brooks with Annie on the
other side and snaps a selfie of the three of them. Just
then, the phone rings. It’s Ryan. He shows Annie.

MAX (CONT'D)
Probably begging for help.

He hits “ignore.”

MAX (CONT'D)
I feel like maybe we should call
that company and complain because
this wasn’t much of a mystery.

Brooks MOANS wildly, practically JUMPING OUT OF HIS CHAIR
trying to communicate.

ANNIE
All right, all right...

She yanks off Brooks’ gag.
BROOKS
(as soon as the gag’s off)
THIS ISN’T A GAME!
BANG! Someone begins kicking the door from the other side.

MAX
Why, because we kicked your ass?

BROOKS
Max, THOSE ARE NOT THE GUYS I
HIRED!
58.

MAX
Oh I get it. Now you’re trying to
change the rules on us?

BANG! The door shakes.

BROOKS
Listen to me. I’m not a venture
capitalist. I’m a smuggler!

MAX
A smuggler? What the hell are you
talking about?

BROOKS
(scared)
I fucked up. I sold the
Bulgarian’s egg to a different guy
and now I have to get it back or
he’s gonna kill me.

MAX
Ooh, the Bulgarian’s egg. Did you
trade it for the Maltese Falcon?

ANNIE
Wait. This isn’t the end?

MAX
You said whoever found you got the
car. Game over.

BROOKS
I’m telling you. This isn’t a
game! It’s all real!

SMASH! The door starts to splinter.

MAX
Uh huh. Those shitty actors are
real? That fight was real?

ANNIE
This gun is real?

She points the gun at the ceiling...

BROOKS
Annie, stop!

ANNIE
Oh no. Bang bang--

She pulls the trigger. BANG! A REAL BULLET SHATTERS the
hanging florescent light above them.
59.

Startled, Annie drops the gun. It hits the tloor and FIRES
AGAIN. BANG!

MAX
ow!

Max looks down at his arm. It looks okay... until a red
circle of blood appears through his shirt. Annie just shot
him. A stunned beat, then--

ANNIE MAX (CONT'D)
AAAAHHHHH! ! WHAT IN THE FUCK!!

ANNIE
OH MY GOD I SHOT YOU!!

MAX
YOU FUCKING SHOT ME!!!

BROOKS
I told you! Untie me! Quick!

Annie unties Brooks, her hands shaking as Bald Guy and
Ponytail burst into the room.

They spot the bag with their weapons and go for it as Max,
Brooks and Annie run to the rear emergency exit door.

Ponytail and Bald Guy retrieve their guns and FIRE in their
direction.

BROOKS (CONT’D)
Go!

EXT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Annie, Max and Brooks sprint across the street to their car,
still screaming.

MAX
You shot me!

ANNIE
I know! I feel terrible!

Annie runs over to the driver’s side and unlocks it, getting
behind the wheel. Brooks jumps in the backseat as Annie
peels out with Max in the passenger seat.

Bald Guy and Ponytail race to their van, firing wild shots at
the car as they go.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
STOP!!

(another gunshot)
STOP DOING THAT!
60.

They barrel around a corner.

INT. MAX’S CAR - NIGHT

Annie drives like a madwoman while Max clutches his arm--

ANNIE
It’s all real! How did it all get
real?!

MAX

You shot me! I’m bleeding out of
my arm. I’m gonna die tonight.

Brooks reaches from the backseat and wraps a gym towel around
Max's forearm.

BROOKS
Here. Hold this on there.

The van closes in on their car.

MAX
What the fuck is going on, Brooks?
Talk!

ANNIE

They're right behind us!

BROOKS
I've been lying to you and the rest
of the family about what I do. I
buy and sell things that aren’t
strictly legal for people who
aren't strictly... good.

MAX
So you're a criminal?

BROOKS
Yes. And I made a mistake.
There’s this guy. They call him
the Bulgarian. He has his fingers
in all these pies around the world.

MAX
What kind of pies?

BROOKS
Bad pies, Max. Pies that have
heroin in them and guns and sex
slaves. He asked me to find this
Fabergé egg for him. And I found
it.

(MORE )
61.

BROOKS (CONT'D)

But then I heard about this other
guy, Marlon Freeman, who was
willing to pay twice as much for
the same egg.

MAX
(re: the van)
So these guys work for the
Bulgarian? And they just happened
to crash your murder mystery party?

BROOKS
I know. What are they odds?
(then)
I never should've gotten into
business with that guy. I’m too
small-time for this shit!

The van has caught up and suddenly SWERVES into the side of
their car. They FISHTAIL, nearly running onto the sidewalk
before Annie regains control and speeds away.

ANNIE
We need to go to the cops!

BROOKS
We can’t! He’s got cops on his
payroll. I’11 be dead before I
even get to jail.

MAX
Then why don’t you go to this
Marlon Freeman and buy the egg back
from him?

BROOKS
I couldn't find him if I wanted.
That name was an alias.

ANNIE
What do we do?! These guys aren’t
stopping!

BROOKS

They won’t stop till they get me.
(making a decision)

I’m sorry I dragged you into all

this. I’m sorry for a lot of

things.

He opens his car door.

MAX
What are you doing?!

BROOKS
I love you, Maxie.
62.

And with that, Brooks rolls out of the moving car. He lands
hard on the street as the van SCREECHES TO A STOP a few feet
away from him.

MAX
No! Stop the car!

Annie brakes a couple hundred feet from the van. They look
back to see Ponytail and Bald Guy grab Brooks and haul him
toward the van.

Bald Guy raises his gun and fires a couple shots in their
direction. Annie steps on the gas and tears away.

ANNIE
Shit! Shit! Shit!

MAX
What are we gonna do? They’re
gonna kill my brother.
(then)
I feel faint. I’m gonna pass out.

ANNIE
We've gotta get you to a hospital.

MAX
No! It’s a gunshot wound. They’1ll
call the police.

ANNIE

So, let’s go to a mob doctor!
MAX

Do you know a mob doctor?
ANNIE

Of course not!
MAX

Then why did you say a mob doctor?
ANNIE

Because I’m losing my shit here!
MAX

You're going to have to do it.
ANNIE

What?
MAX

You're gonna have to take the

bullet out.
ANNIE

I don’t want to.
63.

MAX
I don’t want you to either, hon.
I’ve seen you try to cut a chicken.
But we don’t have a lot of options.

Off her look of nauseated horror,

EXT. 7-11 PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Annie exits the convenience story with a bag of stuff. Her
phone rings. It’s Michelle.

ANNIE
(into phone)
Hey.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. BROOKS’ KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Michelle and Kevin share her phone. Ryan and Jillian stand
nearby.

MICHELLE
Thank god. Listen, honey, it’s all
real--

ANNIE

We know. Brooks is caught up in
something. Where are you right
now?

MICHELLE
We're all at Brooks’s waiting to
talk to the cops.

Through a doorway, we see TWO POLICE OFFICERS taking a
statement from Agent Henderson. An EMT tends to his head.

ANNIE
Don’t talk to the cops!

KEVIN
Why? What’s going on? Are you
guys okay?

ANNIE
We're fine. I shot Max but he’s
fine.

MICHELLE

What?!
64.

ANNIE
We’ll meet you back at our house.
Just don’t tell the cops anything.
Brooks's life depends on it.

Annie hangs up. Michelle digests this, then

MICHELLE
(quietly to the other)
Come on. We’ve gotta get out of
here.

RYAN
(full volume)
Where are we going?

She shoves him toward the kitchen door. The others follow.

RYAN (CONT'D)
(loudly)
I thought we were gonna talk to the
cops.

Jillian rolls her eyes as she ushers Ryan out.

EXT. 7-11 - NIGHT

Annie walks around to the rear of the store to find Max
sitting on the hood of the car, cradling his arm.

ANNIE
I got a bunch of stuff.

She begins laying out items on the hood.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Tweezers, pocket knife, gauze,
sewing kit.

Max picks up a bottle of white wine.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
They didn’t have rubbing alcohol
and they don’t sell hard liquor so
I got this chardonnay.

Max twists off the top and takes a slug, then notices a
magazine in the bag.

MAX
Country Living magazine? What's
that for?

ANNIE
It’s for later.
(MORE )
65.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
They have a butternut squash soup
recipe that looked great.
(then)
Now put this in your mouth.

She hands him a DOG’s SQUEAKY CHEW TOY in the shape of a
hamburger. Max sighs and bites down on the toy. SQUEAK!

Annie rolls up his sleeve and recoils at the bloody mess.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Oh god!

She takes out her phone, types something and sets it on the
hood.

MAX
(mouth full)
What’s that?

ANNIE
Instructions on how to remove a
bullet. It’s an alt-right militia
website so I’m just gonna ignore
the racist stuff... “Step one:
sterile gloves.”

She slips on a pair of rubber dishwashing gloves.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Check. “Step two: clean wound with
antiseptic.”
She pours the wine over Max’s arm. SQUEAK!

ANNIE (CONT'D)

Sorry. “Three: administer
anesthetic.” Gonna skip that...
“Four: apply pressure above the
wound.” Here. Squeeze there.

She takes his other hand and Max squeezes his injured arm.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
“Make small incision on each side
of wound.” Oh jeez. Here we go.

She opens the pocket knife, pours some wine on it and cuts
into his arm. SQUEEEEEAAK! She continues to cut. Max spits
out the dog toy.

MAX
Nope! Too big! You're cutting too
big! It’s a bullet, not a golf
ball.
66.
ANNIE
Well, I don’t know!

MAX
So much blood.

He dry heaves a little.
ANNIE
Don’t you do that! You’re gonna
make me-- DAWWWWWWW!

She dry heaves. Max dry heaves. They manage to collect
themselves.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
That was close. Okay, next step...
shit!

MAX
What?

ANNIE
My phone went to sleep. Hang on.

She takes off her glove and re-enters her passcode.

MAX
Just set it so it stays on.
ANNIE
My phone doesn’t do that.
MAX
We have the same phone! It does
that.
ANNIE

It’s fine. 1I'’11 just touch the
screen with my nose every 30
seconds.

MAX
Why are you so afraid of your
phone? Just go to “settings,” then
“display” then adjust the time
before it reverts to sleep mode.

ANNIE
“Revert”? What are you, Steve
Jobs?

MAX

It's the easiest fucking thing!

ANNIE
Enough! I know what I’m doing!
67.

She touches her nose to the screen. Max rolls his eyes. She
reads the next step.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, this is going to hurt.
Where’s your squeaky hamburger?

She finds it and shoves it in his mouth. She takes the
tweezers and begins digging around in the bullet hole. Max
writhes in pain.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I feel something hard. I think I
found the bullet...

She taps something with the tip of her tweezers. We hear a
clinking sound. Max inhales painfully.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
It’s really wedged in there. Why
won't it come out? Oh wait.
That’s bone. I’m sorry.

Sweat and tears pour down Max’s face.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
I can’t find it. Let me see what
the racists say if you can’t find
the bullet...

She touches her nose to the phone again, then suddenly
notices something on Max’s arm.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Hang on. What’s this? Did you get
shot twice?!

She shows him a hole on the other side of his arm. Max spits
out the chew toy again.

MAX
God damn it, Annie. That’s an exit
wound.

ANNIE
Ohhh. Well, that’s good news,
right?

Max looks like he’s going to faint. Annie inspects the
wound.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(disgusted)
This one’s even uglier than the
entry wound. WHAAUUUGGGH!

She dry heaves.
68.

MAX
Stop that-- BWAHHHHH!

He dry heaves. They both dry heave together.

INT. MAX AND ANNIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max and Annie bring Ryan, Jillian, Kevin and Michelle up to
speed.

MAX
...now the Bulgarian’s guys have
Brooks and the only way to save him
is to get that egg back from this
Marlon Freeman guy.

RYAN
Man. I can’t believe your brother
has been lying to us this whole
time.
(beat)
He’s even cooler than we thought!

MICHELLE
I didn’t even know Morgan Freeman
collected Fabergé eggs. Aren’t
those worth millions of dollars?

MAX
Marlon Freeman. But that’s just an
alias. Somehow we need to find his
real name and address.

RYAN
Police computer.

MAX
What?

RYAN

I once dated this girl who’s dad
was a cop. She had these big,
thick legs but not a trace of flab.
Solid muscle. She looked like the

mom in “The Incredibles.” Y‘know?
Tiny little waist but then it V's
out-—

JILLIAN

Why are you telling us this?!

RYAN
Oh. Sorry. She showed me her
dad's police computer one time.
(MORE )
69.

RYAN (CONT'D)
It’s got this database with every
known alias. I bet you could find
Marlon Wayans’ real name on that.

ANNIE
If you called her do you think
she’d let you use her dad’s
computer again?

RYAN
Oh, no. No way. It ended very
badly.

JILLIAN

I’m shocked.

MICHELLE
Well, how are we gonna get ona
police computer without the cops
knowing?

KEVIN
I've got it!

They all turn to him.

KEVIN (CONT'D)
Billy Bob Thornton.

MAX
Huh?

KEVIN
(to Michelle)
You slept with Billy Bob Thornton,
didn’t you?

MICHELLE
No!

KEVIN
Then why was he so friendly to you
that one time at 24 Hour Fitness?
It felt like you already knew each
other.

MICHELLE
That wasn’t Billy Bob Thornton!
That was Shawn, my dental
hygienist.

KEVIN
That's awfully convenient, isn’t
it?

MICHELLE
For who?
70.

ANNIE
Everyone shut up for a second.
(then)
I know where we can get on a police
computer.

EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gary opens the door on Max, Annie, Ryan, Jillian, Kevin and
Michelle, all wearing unnaturally wide smiles.

MAX
Heeeyyy, Gare....

REVERSE TO REVEAL: Gary, a lamb shank in one hand, Bastian
the dog in the other. A napkin tucked into his police
uniform. From inside we can hear the faint, tinny sound of
Al Jolson crooning “Toot, Toot, Tootsie!”

GARY
Goodness. To what do Bastian and I
owe the pleasure?

MAX
We were all talking and we realized
we haven’t had a game night in
ages. Just the seven of us.

GARY
(dubious )
It’s ten o’clock. And I thought
you were going to your brother's
house.

MAX
He was tied up.
(realizing)
With work.

RYAN
Come on, Gare Bear, it’s the
weekend. Live a little.

MICHELLE
We were just saying how you were
always better at games than Debbie
was.

GARY
(intense)
I‘1l thank you not to besmirch my
ex-wife. That woman is an angel.
71.

MICHELLE
(backtracking)
Whoa. Okay. No, I mean I like
her. We all like her.

Gary's wild-eyed look gives way to a smile.

GARY
I will admit, I have eagerly
awaited a visit such as this.

He backs into the darkness of his house and the creepy 1920's
music.

ANNIE
Do we follow him?

MAX
Seems like it.

JILLIAN
(pushing Ryan)
You go first.

RYAN
I'm afraid.

They all nervously enter.

INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The group sit around a coffee table as Jillian finishes
building a Jenga tower. Gary enters with a bowl.

GARY
Help yourselves to popped corn with
sea salt.

Gary plops the bowl in Max’s arms right on his covered wound.

MAX
(wincing)
ARRGGHHHH...
(covering)
I love popped corn!

Ryan notices a framed photo on a table. It shows the game
night group, including Gary’s ex-wife Debbie, with Gary
looming in the background.

RYAN
You have a framed photo of game
night?
72.

GARY
Doesn’t everyone have photos of
their best friends in their homes?

The group exchange guilty looks.

ANNIE
Of course. Max, you want to go
first?

Max takes out the first piece then stands.

MAX
I’m sorry, could I use your
bathroom?

GARY
Of course. Just down the hall,
past our bedr--
(he shuts his eyes,
pained)
--my bedroom.

The others give Max a knowing look as he heads off. Bastian
the dog trots after Max.

INT. GARY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Max hurries to the bathroom, turns on the light and fan, then
closes the door without going in. He spots another room and
quickly ducks inside. Bastian follows.

INT. GARY’S STUDY - NIGHT

The room is a SHRINE to Debbie. Photos, keepsakes,
embroidered pillows, greeting cards, an ENORMOUS WEDDING
PHOTO of her and Gary over the desk.

MAX
Jesus.

He spots a reinforced police laptop on the desk and opens it.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Michelle carefully slides a piece out of the Jenga tower.
There are four players left before Max’s turn.

GARY
So, Jillian. How long have you and
Ryan been a couple?
73.

JILLIAN
Oh, no. We just work together.

GARY
I see. I thought I detected a
certain chemistry between the two
of you.

Jillian and Ryan do their best to laugh this off.

GARY (CONT'D)
Then again, I’m not the world’s
best judge of chemistry.

He lets out THE MOST MIRTHLESS LAUGH IN HISTORY. The others
look deeply uncomfortable.

BACK IN THE STUDY, Max has pulled up the National Police
Database and enters “Marlon Freeman.” A profile comes up
showing a surveillance photo of a distinguished white man in
his 40's, PETER ANDERTON. His suspected crimes include
trafficking in stolen artifacts, insider trading, illegal
weapons sales, etc.

MAX
Hello, Peter Anderton...

Max doesn’t notice a DROP OF BLOOD from his bullet wound has
trickled down his arm and landed on the beige carpet.

Bastian walks over and sniffs it curiously. PLOP. Another
drop lands on the dog’s fluffy white fur.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM Annie is staring at the Jenga tower.
ANNIE
(stalling)
So many possible moves...

RYAN
Come on, Annie. Make up your mind.

Jillian elbows him in the ribs. He realizes.

RYAN (CONT'D)
Oh. Right. Take your time.

Gary looks at them, nonplussed.

BACK IN THE STUDY. By now BASTIAN’S COAT IS SPATTERED WITH
BLOOD but Max has yet to notice. He writes down Anderton’s
address on a pad, starts to shut the laptop but reconsiders.

He types “The Bulgarian” into the alias search window. A
blurry photo of a burly man appears. “Real Name: Unknown.
74.

Address: Unknown.” There’s an extensive list ot suspected
crimes: multiple murders, torture, kidnapping, human
trafficking, arms trafficking, etc.

MAX
Oh, Brooks. What did you get
yourself into...?

He closes the window and shuts the computer and heads for the
door. He notices his arm is leaking blood, then sees A TRAIL
OF BLOOD DROPS leading across the carpet to Bastian who is
now more red than white.

MAX (CONT'D)
Shit!

He shuts the door, then hurries back to the dog and tries
rubbing off the blood with his hand, but it only smears it.

He looks around and spots what looks like a rolled up rag on
a shelf. He hastily begins rubbing the dog with the rag but
it has little effect.

MAX (CONT'D)
Oh my god.

He spits on the dog’s back and rubs it some more. Not
helping.

He sees a bottle of water on the desk. As he moves to grab
it, he accidentally knocks over a ceramic wedding cake
topper. The bride’s head breaks off.

MAX (CONT'D)
No!

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM the others hear Max cry out.
GARY
(standing)
Maybe I should check on Max.

ANNIE
I’m sure he’s fine.

GARY
He cried out.

He moves to go. The others looks at each other desperately.
JILLIAN
(blurting)
Tell me about Debbie!

Gary stops, facing away from them.
75.

GARY
I beg your pardon?

JILLIAN
I never got to meet her. I'd love
to hear what she’s like.

Gary sits back down, looking wistful.

GARY
Where do I begin?

BACK IN THE STUDY. Max is pouring water onto Bastian and
scrubbing him with the rag. Fresh blood continues to seep
out onto the dog, making him even messier.

MAX
This is not working...

He unrolls the rag and reacts as he sees it’s not a rag but a
SOUVENIR T-SHIRT with a photo showing a smiling Debbie on a
beach on vacation. The image is smeared with blood.

MAX (CONT'D)
Of course.

Just then, the wet dog SHAKES HIMSELF OFF vigorously. BLOODY
WATER FLIES EVERYWHERE, spattering the walls of the room
including the enormous wedding photo.

Gary’s shrine to Debbie now looks more like the scene of a
murder. Max stands and takes it in.

MAX (CONT'D)
(sighs)
Fuck this.

He wraps the shirt around his arm, covers it with his jacket,
then leaves the room, closing the door on the fluffy, pink
dog and the blood-spattered room.

INT. GARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gary regales the group with memories.

GARY
...-when she laughed it was like a
concerto and if you were there to
hear it, you considered yourself
lucky just to be in the audience.

MICHELLE
(sotto, to Kevin)
I don’t remember her laugh being
that great.
76.

Max enters.

MAX
We should go.

GARY
What? But you haven’t taken your
turn at the Jenga tower.

MAX
Right.

He reaches down and deliberately knocks over the tower.

MAX (CONT'D)
Darn it. Let’s go. Thank you,
Gary. This was great.

The others quickly stand, ad lib goodbyes and head out.

GARY
When shall we play next?

ANNIE
We’ll call you.

And they’re gone. Gary stands there for a moment. Then,

GARY
Bastian?

INT. KEVIN AND MICHELLE’S VAN - NIGHT
Kevin drives the group in his Honda Odyssey.

KEVIN
So what do we do when we get to
Peter Anderton’s house? Knock on
his door and ask for his million
dollar egg back?

MAX
I don’t know. Maybe if I explain
the situation he’ll want to help.

MICHELLE
(sarcastic)
Oh, yeah, most criminal
millionaires have hearts of gold.

SFX: Max's recharged cell phone rings.
MAX

Private number. Please don’t be
Gary...
MAX (CONT'D)
Hello?

DISTORTED MALE VOICE (ON SPEAKER)

We have your brother.

MAX
Oh my god. Okay, listen. We know
who has the egg. We’re on our way
there right now. We can do a
trade. Please don’t hurt Brooks.

There’s a long pause on the line.
DISTORTED MALE VOICE (ON PHONE)
Meet us on the East 4th Street
Bridge at midnight. If you’re late
he dies.
MAX
That’s only an hour from now--

But the caller hangs up.

MAX (CONT'D)
Shit.

RYAN
Those guys aren’t fucking around.
Dude sounded like Kylo Ren.

KEVIN
We're here.

The van pulls up to what appears to be a large gated estate

surrounded by a tall hedge. Max starts to get out.

MAX
You guys head back to the house.
I’1l call you as soon as I have the
egg.

ANNIE
What are you talking about? We’re
coming with you.

MAX
No way. It could be really
dangerous in there. Brooks
shouldn’t have dragged any of us
into his mess. But he’s my brother
and it’s up to me to fix this.

RYAN
Bullshit. We’re all in this
together.
78.

MICHELLE
You know we'd do anything for you.

ANNIE
No. Max is right. You guys should
go home. This is our problem.

KEVIN
And what happens if you don’t make
it out?

MICHELLE

Do you have any idea what game
night means to us? We don’t come
over because we’re dying to play
charades and stupid ass children’s
shit. We come over because we love

you guys.

KEVIN
It’s the best part of our week.

RYAN
Mine too. And I’ve got a lot of
options on the weekend.

MICHELLE
Brooks may be your brother. But
we're all family here.

Max and Annie are visibly touched.

MAX
Thank you.

ANNIE
We love you guys too.

There’s a nice beat, then they all realize Jillian is there.

MAX
You should totally go home, though.
You don’t even know us.

JILLIAN
You're right. I don’t. But if you
guys are cool with it, I’d like to
stay.

RYAN
Really?

JILLIAN
This has been the most exciting
night of my life.

(MORE )
79.

JILLIAN (CONT'D)
Most Friday nights I eat a Chipotle
bowl by myself and watch “Orange is
the New Black” on my iPad.

RYAN
That’s exactly what I imagined.

She elbows him.

ANNIE
You've got an open invitation to
all future game nights, Jillian.

MAX
As long as we don’t die tonight.

KEVIN
Speaking of which, how are we gonna
get into this place?

Just then, a car pulls up to the intercom and the gate opens.

RYAN
Go, go, go!

Kevin drives in behind the other car.

EXT. ANDERTON HOUSE - NIGHT

Kevin’s van pulls up to where a couple dozen expensive cars
are parked in the driveway. The house is lit up and shouting
can be heard from inside. The group steps out of the van.

ANNIE
Looks like they’re having a party.

MAX
That could be good. We can get in
there and look for the egg without
anyone noticing us.

They approach the house and peek in a window. Inside they
see A SCULPTURE OF A SHARK SUBMERGED IN FORMALDEHYDE along
with recognizable modern paintings on the walls.

MICHELLE
Damn. Warhol, Rothko, Damien
Hirst. This guy’s gotta have the
egg.

They peer into the kitchen where we see a chef handing trays
of hors d’oeuvres to several CATERERS.
80.

RYAN
So what’s the plan? We knock out
six of those caterers, drag them
into a closet and come out wearing
their clothes?

MAX
You gonna knock out six innocent
people and strip them naked?

RYAN
You got a better plan?

MAX
Yeah. We wear our own clothes and
look for the fucking egg. Now come
on.

INT. ANDERTON FOYER - NIGHT

The group enter to find a crowd of well-dressed MEN and a
handful of WOMEN in their 40’s and 50’s huddled around
something we can’t see. They’re cheering and throwing down
hundred dollar bills. Attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESSES serve
drinks.

Our guys stick out from the crowd, but no one seems to
notice.

ANNIE
What is this?

They see an opening in the crowd and react: in the center TWO
BARE-KNUCKLED WHITE MEN in their 30’s are pummeling the shit
out of each other.

MAX
No way.

JILLIAN
It’s some kind of rich guys’ fight
club.

They all turn to Ryan who gasps.

RYAN
I knew it! I told you they were
real!

Just then, one of the two combatants, BOOMER, KNOCKS THE
OTHER ONE UNCONSCIOUS. A distinguished 40-something man,
MR. ANDERTON, lets out a celebratory shout as he holds up
Boomer’s hand.

MR. ANDERTON
That’s my Boomer!
81.

He plants a kiss on Boomer’s sweaty, bald head, then slaps
him on the back like a racehorse.

KEVIN
This is some Django Unchained
bullshit.

Anderton mocks one of his guests, WARREN.

MR. ANDERTON
Sorry, Warren. Don’t think you’re
gonna be able to amortize that
loss.

Several of the guests laugh and jeer Warren. Anderton holds
up a water bottle that Boomer suckles from.

MR. ANDERTON (CONT'D)
Kramer! Get Logan ready. Minimum
buy-in is now ten grand.

Another rich guy leads his muscly fighter, LOGAN, into the
“ring.”

RYAN
Rich people are fucked up, huh?

MAX
All right, let’s split up. Anyone
finds the egg, text the others.
And for god’s sake be careful with
it. It’s the only chance Brooks
has.

Max and Annie, Kevin and Michelle head off. Jillian goes to
leave but notices Ryan is moving closer to the fight which
has just begun.

JILLIAN
What are you doing?!

RYAN
I’ve got a good feeling about
Logan. Do you have ten grand on
you?

INT. ANDERTON MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kevin and Michelle stealthily enter a lavish bedroom and
begin looking around.

MICHELLE
Wow. This is the biggest bedroom
I’ve ever seen.
82.

KEVIN
Bigger than your celebrity
boyfriend's?

MICHELLE
You're still on this?

KEVIN
You gotta tell me who he was,
Michelle. It’s all I can think
about. And that’s saying something
considering there’s a fight club
downstairs.

MICHELLE
Why does it matter so much?

KEVIN
We’ve been together our whole
lives. And I thought I knew
everything about you. Now I find
out there’s this huge secret you’ve
been keeping from me. I’m not mad
that you slept with someone while
we were on a break. I’m sad that
you felt you had to keep it from
me.

Michelle stares at him for a beat. Finally,

MICHELLE
Glenn Close.

KEVIN
Huh?

MICHELLE

The celebrity I slept with. It was
Glenn Close.

KEVIN
Get the fuck out of town.
MICHELLE
I was a waitress at the premiere
party of “102 Dalmations.” I was

about to start freshman year at
William and Mary and it turned out
Glenn went there too. We started
talking and we ended up back at her
house. We were both a little drunk
and one thing led to another.

KEVIN
It was just that one time?
83.

MICHELLE

I haven’t seen or spoken to her
since.

(beat)
I always knew you and I weren’t
gonna be apart for long and I
wanted to do something crazy while
I had the chance.

KEVIN
So you made love to Cruella
DeVille.

MICHELLE

Are you upset?

KEVIN
No, baby. I’m glad you got it out
of your system. And by the way,
well done. Glenn Close is a
national treasure. I wish you had
told me years ago.

MICHELLE
I didn’t think you'd take it this
well.

KEVIN

Now, if you’d told me it was Denzel
I would've killed myself.

INT. ANDERTON LIBRARY - NIGHT

Max and Annie search through a beautiful wood and leather
library. She notices photos on the shelves showing Anderton
with a TROPHY WIFE and FIVE KIDS.

ANNIE
How can this monster have five kids
and we can’t even make one?

MAX
Well, his wife looks like she’s
about fifteen.
(then, distracted)
Don’t worry. We’ll get there.

ANNIE
I’m starting to feel like I’m
pushing this baby thing on you.

MAX
No. It’s just-- when we first met
we did whatever we wanted.
Whenever we wanted.

(MORE )
84.

MAX (CONT'D)

And then we got real jobs and a
mortgage and car loans and now we
only have one night of the week
where we get to let loose and have
fun. Game night. And once we have
a kid, we won’t even have that
anymore.

Annie suddenly realizes something.

ANNIE
You weren’t stressed because your
brother was coming to town. You’re
stressed because you didn’t want to
have a kid in the first place.
Your sperm doesn’t work because
you're afraid your sperm might
work.

Max looks away. He knows she’s right.

MAX
How about we put a pin in this
until my brother is safe?

ANNIE
Yeah. Sure.

Off Annie’s sad look,

INT. ANDERTON LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Ryan watches raptly as Logan and Boomer beat the hell out of
each other. Jillian is losing patience.

RYAN
Come on, Logan! Boomer ain’t shit!

JILLIAN
Can we go? We’re supposed to be
looking for the--

Suddenly, she notices one of Anderton’s EMPLOYEES banding
together a stack of bills he’s taken from a money counter.

He places the cash in a wall safe but does not shut it. Just
beside the stacked cash Jillian spots A BEJEWELED, ORNATELY
DECORATED FABERGE EGG.

JILLIAN (CONT'D)
Whoa.

(she pokes Ryan)
Look. It’s right there!

RYAN
Holy shit. Good eyes. Stay here.
85.

He heads ott.

JILLIAN
What are you going to do?

RYAN
I’m gonna grab it. They’re all
watching the fight.

He casually weaves through the crowd of shouting men to the
open wall safe. He glances around. No one has noticed him.
He grabs the egg.

Just then, POW! Boomer delivers a crippling blow to Logan,
knocking him out. The crowd roars. Boomer looks up and
stares quizzically at Ryan. Everyone else follows his gaze.
The room goes silent. All eyes are on Ryan.

MR. ANDERTON
Who the hell are you?

RYAN
Hm?

MR. ANDERTON
What are you doing with my egg?

RYAN
(adopting a fake air of
haughtiness)
I was... simply admiring it. It’s
a fine specimen. I have dozens of
such eggs in my collection. I’ma
bit of a connoisseur if you will.

MR. ANDERTON
Does anyone here know this guy?

RYAN
Everyone knows me. I’m a mogul
like you gentlemen. And after a
hard day of selling stocks and
acquiring assets, I like to unwind
with a cognac and a good fight.
I’m a bit of a connoisseur if you
will.

Jillian buries her head in her hands.

MR. ANDERTON
You're full of shit.

RYAN
How dare ye?
86.

MR. ANDERTON
(to Boomer)
Take this guy down, please.
Boomer shoves through the crowd toward Ryan who bolts with
the egg.
INT. ANDERTON HOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Max and Annie rejoin Kevin and Michelle.

MAX
Any luck?

KEVIN
Yeah! We actually worked out our
issue.

MAX
I’m talking about the egg!

KEVIN
Oh, no. Nothing.

Suddenly, Ryan and Jillian CHARGE PAST THEM. Ryan holds the
egg and looks terrified.

RYAN
(shouting)
Go, go, go!

Boomer rushes in hot on Ryan’s tail. The others scramble.

Ryan stumbles and DROPS the egg. It is caught just in time
by Annie who laterals it to Michelle. Boomer pursues whoever
holds the egg and it turns into a_high-stakes game of “hot
potato.”

Finally, Jillian finds herself holding the egg with no one to
pass it to. She stands like a deer in headlights as Boomer
charges straight for her.

At the last possible second, the fighter is TACKLED FROM THE
SIDE BY RYAN who has instinctively leapt to Jillian's aid.

The two men CRASH into the Damien Hirst shark artwork. The
GLASS PANEL SHATTERS AND GALLONS OF FORMALDEHYDE POUR OUT
ALONG WITH THE PRESERVED SHARK CARCASS.

RYAN (CONT'D)
Oh god!

Boomer is dazed. Ryan clambers to his feet, stumbling over
the rubbery fish corpse and the group races out of the house.
87.

EXT. ANDERTON ESTATE - NIGHT

Max and the others run toward Kevin's minivan. Anderton and
his guests pour out the door in pursuit. A soaking wet
Boomer leads the charge as our group piles into the Odyssey.

KEVIN
Come on! Get in!

He floors it and they speed down the driveway and out to the
street.

INT. KEVIN’S CAR - NIGHT

Everyone catches their breath as Kevin speeds along. Max
holds the egg.

ANNIE
Well, that was unusual.

Jillian turns to Ryan who looks dazed.

JILLIAN
You really saved me back there.

RYAN
Yeah. Why did I do that? It’s
like I saw you were in trouble and
this feeling came over me. Like I
wanted to help you even if I didn’t
get anything out of it.

ANNIE
Sounds like love, Ryan.

RYAN
What? Ew. No, it doesn’t.

JILLIAN
Yeah. Gross, Annie.

But as they blow off the moment, we can see both Ryan and
Jillian are in uncharted territory.

MAX
(tense)
Two minutes to twelve. Where’s
this bridge?

KEVIN
GPS says it’s right around here but
I don’t see it.

ANNIE
(points)
There it is! 4th Street.
88.

Seeing they’re passing the bridge, Kevin SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
In SUPER-SLOW MOTION, we see the egg fly out of Max’s hands.

MAX
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucccecckkkkkkk!

The egg passes between the front seats and SHATTERS AGAINST
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. Jewels and enamel fly all over the
dashboard. After a beat,

KEVIN
Oh my.

MAX
That’s it. They’re gonna kill my
brother.

RYAN

Hang on. Maybe we can fix this...

Ryan picks up a few shards of egg and tries piecing them
together but they fall apart in his hands.

RYAN (CONT'D)
This is more fragile than a real
egg.
(then)
Did they specifically say it had to
be in one piece?

Michelle examines some of the tiny gems on the dashboard.

MICHELLE
I’m not an expert, but these gems
look kinda plastic to me.

Max leans forward and examines some of the pieces. Inside
one he notices a small sticker.

MAX
(reading)
“Made in China”? Is this thing not
even real?

RYAN
Maybe just that sticker was made in
China.

JILLIAN
(quietly)
Let’s let them talk.

KEVIN
Why would the Bulgarian ask Brooks
to get him a fake egg?
89.

Annie notices something amidst the shattered egg. A TINY
ROLLED UP PAPER. She picks it up and examines it.

ANNIE
I don’t think he wanted the egg at
all. I think he wanted what was
inside of it.

INSERT on the roll of paper. It’s a list of names and
addresses in tiny type. At the top is a header: “WITSEC.”

MAX
“WITSEC"? What is that?

JILLIAN
We can ask them.

She points to the opposite end of the bridge where we can see
a black van coming to a stop. Ponytail and Bald Guy step
out, open the rear door and drag out a frightened Brooks.

Our group steels themselves as they climb out of the minivan.
Ryan scoops the shattered egg pieces into a travel mug.
Jillian looks at him.

RYAN
In case they ask for it.
EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Max, Annie and the others move nervously to where the thugs
stand in the middle of the bridge holding guns on Brooks.

BALD GUY
You tell anyone you were coming
here?

MAX
No. I swear. Listen, we've got
your egg--

BROOKS
You do?!

MAX

But we broke it.

BROOKS
What?!

Ryan shakes the travel mug helpfully.

ANNIE
It was a fake. But we have the
list of names inside.

(MORE )
90.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
(holding it up)
That’s what you wanted, right?

The thugs exchange a look.

PONYTAIL
Get on the ground.

MAX
We have what you want. Why can’t
you just let us go?

Ponytail shoves his gun in Max's face.

PONYTAIL
I said “on the ground”!

They all lie down on their stomachs. Brooks lies beside Max.

Ponytail begins moving down the line, collecting wallets and
cell phones. Bald Guy takes out his own phone and dials.

BALD GUY
(into phone)
It’s me. We’ve got ‘em all here.

As Bald Guy walks off to talk, Brooks turns to Max.

BROOKS
The Bulgarian’s gonna kill me.
Probably you guys too. Why did you
come back?

MAX
You're my brother. I can’t just
let you die. Even if you deserve
it.

BROOKS
You're unbelievable. You were
always a better person than me.

MAX
Please shut up.

BROOKS
I’m being serious.

Max rolls his eyes.
BROOKS (CONT'D)

Look, I haven’t been totally honest
with you.
91.

MAX
Yeah, Brooks, I know. That’s why
we're lying on a bridge at
midnight.

BROOKS
I don’t mean about this. I mean
about everything. I’m not the guy
you think I am. I’m not even the
guy you think I think I am.

MAX
What are you talking about?

BROOKS
I’m a fraud. Everyone sees me as
this cool, carefree dude who wins
at everything he touches. Well,
you know how I win? I cheat, Max.
I cheat at everything. Even when
we were little kids and we would
play Battleship.

MAX
Come on.

BROOKS
Didn’t you notice how I always made
you sit with your back to the TV?
It was so I could see where your
ships were in the reflection. And
I always pocketed five grand in
Monopoly before we even started
playing. I cheated at the Game of
Life. And the game of life.

MAX
Son of a bitch.

BROOKS

But it didn’t stop there. We grew
up and you went to college and met
Annie and became a writer. I knew
I couldn't compete with your
success. So I told everyone I got
a job on Wall Street. And I did.
Selling coke to the traders.

MAX
You never were a venture
capitalist?

BROOKS
I’m not even sure what “venture
capitalist” means.
92.

MAX
So this whole time that I’ve felt
like a complete failure next to
you, you've felt the same way about
me?

BROOKS
(smiles)
Kinda funny, huh?

MAX
No! It’s not funny! It’s shitty!
You turned me into a self-doubting,
competitive mess! You even broke
my sperm!

BROOKS
Okay, I’m not sure what that last
thing means, but listen. I’ve been
trying to find a way to make it up
to you. That’s what this whole
game night was supposed to be. I
rigged it so you would finally win.
The last clue was gonna lead you to
your jacket pocket.

Puzzled, Max reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the
key to Brooks’ Stingray.

MAX
Whoa.

BROOKS
Surprise. But I even fucked that
up. I’m so sorry, man.

He puts his forehead on the asphalt, defeated. Max puts a
hand on his shoulder.

MAX
You know what? We’re gonna be
okay. I can feel it.

ANGLE ON Bald Guy finishing his call.

BALD GUY
(into phone)
.--all of them? You sure that’s
necessary?
(beat)
Okay.

He hangs up and turns to Ponytail.

PONYTAIL
What’d he say?
They cock

Panicked,

They kiss.

93.
BALD GUY
We gotta take ‘em all out.
their guns. Our group all react, terrified.
MICHELLE

(to the thugs)
Wait! We got you the list!

ANNIE
Just let us go. No one needs to
know!
MICHELLE
(to Kevin)

I’m sorry I fucked Glenn Close.

KEVIN
I’m sorry I fucked Karen Waller.

MICHELLE
You said it was a handjob!

Ryan turns to Jillian.

RYAN
(rapid-fire)
I know you’re too smart for me and
you could do way better, but I
really like you and I might love
you! Do you love me?!

JILLIAN
No, I don’t think so, but if you
want to kiss I’d be okay with that.

RYAN
Fair enough!

Then,

JILLIAN
You smell like a preserved shark.

Ponytail and Bald Guy point their guns. They’re about to
fire when-- WOOOP! The chirp of a POLICE CAR SIREN startles

everyone.

They turn

MALE VOICE (0.S.)
Freeze!

to see-- GARY STEPPING OUT OF HIS COP CAR LIKE A

HERO. His weapon is drawn.

MAX
Gary?!
94.

Bald Guy and Ponytail turn their guns on Gary.

BALD GUY
Don’t even think about it, pig!

GARY
Can't say I care for that
nomenclature.

Gary FIRES his gun at them. Bald Guy and Ponytail dive for
cover, returning fire. It’s real and loud and scary.

Everybody scatters, screaming. Ryan covers Jillian. Max
falls on top of Annie. Michelle falls on top of Kevin.

Gary slides across his car’s hood like John McClane, firing

at the thugs. Ponytail gets hit in the gut, his shirt
EXPLODING with red.

Gary aims and fires. Bald Guy ducks too late and gets hit in
the back, dropping like a sack. A beat of quiet.

BROOKS
Is that your neighbor?
MAX
(shaken)
Yes it is.
MICHELLE

Is everybody okay?!

KEVIN
When did Gary get so cool?!

MAX
Gary?! You all right?

Gary emerges from cover.

GARY
I’m fine.
(looking back)
Though in sliding, my belt buckle
may have scratched the finish of my
squad car.

ANNIE
How did you know we were in
trouble?

GARY

The nocturnal Jenga game, my blood-
spattered marital souvenirs and
Max's curious search history piqued
my interest.
95.

MAX
You saved our lives.

GARY
Just doing my jo--

BANG! Gary's chest explodes in an eruption of BLOOD. He
falls to the ground in a heap.

We see that Ponytail has fired one last shot before dying.

MAX
Oh my god!

Annie tries putting pressure on the wound. Max pulls Gary
into his lap as Jillian calls 911--

JILLIAN (ON PHONE)
I need an ambulance, there’s an
officer down....

MAX
Gary! Hold on!

Gary looks down at his chest.

GARY
Oh no...
Ryan dry heaves.
MICHELLE
You’re gonna be fine, Gary! Just

hang on!

Gary coughs and a little blood comes out of his mouth. His
eyelids get heavier.

MAX
Hang on, Gare. We’re gonna get you
to the hospital!

ANNIE
You've got so much to live for!

GARY
(weak)
Do I? I have no wife. No friends.

MAX
We're your friends, pal.

ANNIE
We all love you.

Ryan looks at Kevin. He shrugs.
96.

GARY
You don’t... even like spending
time... with me.
MAX
(choked up)

Not true. We've just been selfish.
We didn’t think about you and what
you needed. I’m so sorry.

GARY
Someone please care for Bastian.

ANNIE
You're gonna care for him yourself.

MAX
Yeah. And when you get out of the
hospital you’re coming to every
game night we have. You hear me?!
That’s a promise!

Annie takes his hand, trying not to cry--

ANNIE
Would you like that, Gary? Would
you like to come back to game
night? You've just gotta keep
breathing.

A very weakened Gary tries to smile. He leans up like he
wants to say something, but he’s too weak. Max and Annie
lean down close...

GARY
(softly)
Don’t you EVER exclude me again.

ANNIE
What?

A beat. Then Gary SPITS OUT what looks to be a plastic
packet from his mouth.

MAX
What’s that? What was that?

GARY
And that is how you do a murder
mystery party.

 

Gary gets to his feet, grinning. Kevin SCREAMS when she sees
Bald Guy and Ponytail stand up, very much still alive,
brushing themselves off.

BROOKS
What the hell is going on?!
Gary nods.
head off.

97.

GARY
I’ve duped you all.
MAX
This was all... a game?
MICHELLE
(furious)
A game?!
GARY

When I learned that you stopped
inviting me to your game nights, I
hijacked Brooks’ murder mystery
party and staged a kidnapping of my
own.

BROOKS
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

JILLIAN
(into phone)
Okay, y’know what? False alarm.
Officer not down. He’s back up.

GARY
What better way to prove my worth
as a game night participant?

KEVIN
(points to Bald Guy and
Ponytail)
So who are those guys? Actors?

GARY
Oh, no, they’re felons. I was able
to shave some time off their parole
in exchange for this little side
project.
(then)
Thank you, gentlemen.

BALD GUY
We square now?

Ponytail and Bald Guy collect their props and

BROOKS
(to Gary)
What kind of psycho are you?! You
put us through all this shit for
your own amusement?!

GARY
Just the opposite. For your
amusement. Did everyone have fun?
98.

MAX
No, Gary. Nobody had fun. And I
got shot with a real bullet!

GARY
I don’t see how that’s possible.
My men were using blanks.

BROOKS
That was my gun. Which was real.
ANNIE
(to Gary)

So, the whole thing with the
Fabergé egg and the Bulgarian.
That was you?

GARY
You’ve lost me.
MAX
The egg with the WITSEC list

inside.
Max shows him the paper.

GARY
WITSEC?
(reading)
This is a list of people in the
federal witness protection program.
How did you get this?

MAX
It was in the egg! Can you please
stop fucking with us now?

GARY
I’m not fudging with you. I
honestly don’t know what--

BANG! Gary is hit in the shoulder by a bullet. Blood spurts
out. Gary falls to the ground.

MAX
Seriously? How stupid do you think
we are?

Brooks spots a BURLY MAN with two armed BODYGUARDS
approaching from the other end of the bridge.

BROOKS
(pointing)
Max?
99.

MAX
(to Gary)
That’s your big twist? You get
shot again? And by who?
Completely new characters you just
introduce at the last minute? I’m
sorry. You jumped the shark, bud.

BROOKS
No, Max...

MAX
And you don’t do a shot in the
shoulder after you did a shot in
the chest. That’s anti-climactic.

He sticks his finger into Gary’s bullet hole. Gary SCREAMS
in pain. Max pulls out his finger.

MAX (CONT'D)
(confused)
Hang on...

Gary reaches for his shoulder walkie.

GARY
(pained)
This is Officer Henson. I’ve got a
ten-double-zero on the 4th Street--

One of the Bodyguards suddenly KICKS GARY IN THE HEAD,
knocking him unconscious. It’s clear this is not staged.

MAX
Jesus!

The Bodyguard picks up the gun Gary dropped and hands it to
his boss, THE BULGARIAN.

THE BULGARIAN
Which one of you is Brooks Davis?

Brooks nervously holds up his hand.

THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
Funny. You don’t look like an
asshole. Do I look like an asshole
to you?

BROOKS
No.

THE BULGARIAN
One of us has to be the asshole in
this transaction because otherwise
I'd have my egg and you’d have your
money.

(MORE )
100.

THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
But instead, we’ve wasted our night
tracking you down. We find Marlon
Freeman. He tells us some idiots
in a minivan stole the egg. Now
we've shot and kicked this
perfectly innocent policeman, and
now we’re gonna have to kill you.

MAX
Excuse me, Mr. Bulgarian? If I
may. I’m Brooks’ brother. He
screwed up. He got greedy. He
knows that. But the good news is,
we got your egg back. Granted,
it’s broken. But we got the list
inside. And I bet that’s what you
wanted all along. So how about
this? You take the list. For
free. We all go our separate ways
and nobody gets hurt.

(then, grim)

Except for the people on that list,
I’m guessing.

Max holds up the list.

THE BULGARIAN
Okay.

MAX
Okay?

THE BULGARIAN
Deal. Makes perfect sense.

Max moves to hand the list over but Brooks stops him.

BROOKS
Wait. You give him that he’s gonna
kill me.

THE BULGARIAN
Nonsense.

(then, dead serious)
Give me the list.

Max hesitates. The Bulgarian nods to his guys who aim their
guns at Brooks and Max. In an instant, Brooks grabs the list
from Max, shoves it in his mouth and swallows it.

THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
What the hell is wrong with you?!

SFX: a distant SIREN WAILS as it comes closer

BROOKS
Just buying myself some time.
101.

THE BULGARIAN
Not much. We’re just gonna cut you
open on the jet.
(to Bodyguards)
Take him.

One Bodyguard grabs Brooks. The other points to the group.

BODYGUARD
What about them?

THE BULGARIAN
Fuck ‘em. We’1ll be out of the
country in an hour.

They back up towards their car, one gun on Brooks, one gun on
the rest of them. Max watches helplessly.

BROOKS
Don't follow me, Max. I’m serious.

THE BULGARIAN
I’m not worried about that.

He takes out a gun. Max flinches. The Bulgarian SHOOTS OUT
two tires on Kevin’s minivan. Max’s face hardens as he
watches the car drive away.

RYAN
Man. This game just gets weirder
and weirder.

Everyone looks at Ryan.

JILLIAN
You know it stopped being a game,
right?

RYAN
(covering)
Duh.

MAX
The only private air terminal
around here is at LAX.
Max starts to head off.
ANNIE
You gonna run there?
MAX
We’re only four blocks from Brooks’

house.

ANNIE
But our car’s not there.
102.

Max holds up the key to the Stingray.

MAX
Yes, it is.

He runs off. Annie sighs and follows.

EXT. PRIVATE AIR HANGAR - NIGHT

One of the Bodyguards shuts the door of a Cessna private jet
as it begins to taxi toward the runway.

INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

He joins the other Bodyguard who is zip-tying Brooks’ hands
to the arm of a seat. The Bulgarian looms over him.

BROOKS
(struggling)
Look, you don’t have to do this.
Just let me poop it out.

THE BULGARIAN
We’re not going to go digging
around in your feces. We’re
civilized men.

He takes out a LARGE KNIFE from a drawer.

THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
Now hold still while I cut your
stomach open.

BROOKS
Wait! 1I’11 do whatever you need me
to do!

He is about to cut when Brooks notices something outside.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
The hell?

The Bulgarian looks out and sees a CORVETTE STINGRAY SMASHING
through the chain-link fence along the runway and speeding
right toward the taxiing jet.

THE BULGARIAN
Is that...?

BROOKS
(proud)
My little brother. He doesn’t know
when to quit.

The Bulgarian turns to the cockpit and barks at the PILOTS.
103.

THE BULGARIAN
Get us in the air! Now!
INT. STINGRAY - CONTINUOUS
Frazzled, Max and Annie chase the jet down the runway.

ANNIE
What’s our plan?!

MAX
The plan was to break through the
fence! Now, I’ve got nothing!

ANNIE
They’re about to take off!

Max steels himself and pours on more speed.
MAX

All right. I’ve got an idea that’s
crazy enough it just might work.

ANNIE
You're gonna crash the car into the
plane?

MAX

Yeah. How’d you know?
ANNIE

‘Cause it’s the only option!
EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS
The jet is nearly lifting off the ground as the Stingray
pulls up alongside. Max turns the wheel hard to the left and
RAMS into the side of the plane.
The jet VEERS OFF COURSE, barreling toward the edge of the
runway. It speeds over the berm and slams to a stop ina
ditch.
INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
The PILOTS are thrown against the controls and knocked
unconscious.

INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

The Bodyguards, the Bulgarian and Brooks are slammed against
the cabin walls.
104.

EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

The totaled car spins out, coming to a halt on the runway.

INT. KEVIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
Max and Annie take a breath.

MAX
Well, at least I got to drive it
for ten minutes.

Annie sees the door of the jet open as one of the armed
Bodyguards steps out.

ANNIE
Quick. Come on!

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

She jumps out of the car and heads across the tarmac away
from the approaching Bodyguard.

Max moves to follow but the Bodyguard is already looking in
his direction. Max ducks behind the Stingray just in time.
The Bodyguard peers inside the car then heads right toward
where Max is hiding.

Just as he’s about to find Max, Annie stumbles and makes a
noise. The Bodyguard turns toward the sound as Annie ducks
for cover behind a baggage conveyor belt loader parked
alongside the tarmac.

The Bodyguard toward her. Annie hides on the other side of
the loader as the Bodyguard looks for her. She and Max lock
eyes from their hiding places.

Frantic to help her, Max suddenly notices a LARGE CRATE
perched at the top of the elevated conveyor belt directly
above the Bodyguard.

Max points at the crate and silently mouths “turn on the
belt.” She doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

He takes out his cell phone to text her: No service.

MAX
Shit.

He gets an idea. He begins to CHARADE to her. He holds up
three fingers. It takes a second but Annie gets it.

ANNIE
(to herself)
Three words.
105.

Max does the tirst word. He spins in a circle.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Spin. Turn.

Yes. Second word: he puts one hand on top of the other.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
On. Turn on what?

Max points to his belt.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
Belt. Turn on belt.

She catches on. She sneaks around to the control panel of
the loader and finds the activation switch.

She’s about to hit it but Max gestures for her to wait. The
Bodyguard circles around the loader. Annie scurries around
it, ducking out of his view.

Finally, the Bodyguard returns to the spot beneath the crate.
Max signals. Annie turns on the conveyor...

..-which starts up with a DEAFENING GROWL of its gas engine.
The conveyor CREEPS UP SUPER-SLOWLY giving the Bodyguard
ample time to see the crate and step out of the way as it
smashes harmlessly to the ground. Max throws up his hands.

But while the Bodyguard is distracted, he is BONKED in the
head by Annie wielding a fire extinguisher she removed from
the loader. He goes down hard.

Annie grabs the Bodyguard’s gun and runs to join Max.

MAX
You saw what I was going for there?

ANNIE
Of course. If that guy had been
deaf and paralyzed it totally
would’ve worked.
(re: the gun)
You want this?

MAX
I know I don’t want you to have it,
Calamity Jane.

He takes the gun and they sneak over toward the jet.

MAX (CONT'D)
Look. There’s a hatch on top of
the plane! Maybe I can get the
drop on them.
106.

Max puts the gun over his shoulder and caretully begins
climbing up onto the wing.

ANNIE
“The drop”?!

MAX
Get to the hangar. See if you can
find a cop or something. I’11 be
okay.

ANNIE
(whisper yell)
You’re not Jack Reacher!

INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

THE BULGARIAN
We're sitting ducks here. Get out
there, kill those fuckers and find
me another plane!

BODYGUARD #2
(re: Brooks)
You okay with him?

The Bulgarian picks up his knife.

THE BULGARIAN
Oh, we’ll be fine.

As the Bodyguard hurries out of the plane, the Bulgarian
approaches Brooks.

THE BULGARIAN (CONT'D)
No more waiting. I’m getting my
list.

We hear a rattling from the ceiling of the plane. The
Bulgarian steps aside just as Max falls through the emergency
hatch, missing the Bulgarian and landing on the floor.

BROOKS
Max!

MAX
Can’t get the drop on anyone
tonight.

Before the Bulgarian can react, Max aims his gun at him.

MAX (CONT'D)
Drop the knife.
107.

But instead, the Bulgarian THROWS the knite at Max. It
sticks into the same arm where he was shot earlier. Max
drops his weapon.

MAX (CONT'D)
ARGGGHH! Right in my bullet hole!

The Bulgarian charges Max but Brooks TRIPS him with his leg.
The Bulgarian falls to the floor and he and Max grapple.

EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Bodyguard searches around the plane, his gun drawn. He
spots Annie hiding behind the nose of the jet and FIRES. She
runs for cover but he has her trapped.

ANNIE
Wait! I have kids! Four of them!

BODYGUARD #2
Bullshit. Not with that ass you
don’t.

ANNIE
(flattered)
Well, thank you for that.
He raises his gun and aims at her head.

BODYGUARD #2
You’re welcome.

INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

Max and the Bulgarian continue to wrestle. They stumble into
the cockpit landing between the unconscious pilots directly
on top of the THRUST LEVER. The engine ROARS TO LIFE.

EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS

The engine directly behind the Bodyguard suddenly REVS to
maximum throttle. The man turns back to look.

BODYGUARD #2
What the f--?

WHOOSH... SPLAT! He’s SUCKED into the engine and shredded.

ANNIE
Yes!
(then, grim)
Oh my god. That’s just horrible.
108.

INT. JET - CONTINUOUS

The fight spills back into the cabin as the Bulgarian spots
the gun Max dropped on the floor. He clambers toward it.
Brooks sticks out his leg and TRIPS HIM AGAIN.

THE BULGARIAN
Stop tripping me!

Max notices a BUNGEE CORD dangling from an overhead
compartment. He grabs it and wraps it around the Bulgarian’s
neck. But the Bulgarian is determined. He continues to
crawl to the weapon as the cord tightens around his throat.

Just as his hand grasps the gun, he collapses on the floor,
unconscious from lack of oxygen.

Max quickly ties him up with the bungee cord so he can’t
move. He cuts Brooks free with the Bulgarian’s knife.

The two brothers stand there as they collect themselves.

BROOKS
Look at that.

ANGLE ON the Bulgarian. Max has wrapped him so his head is
nearly in his own crotch.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
You get a bungee cord in your hand
and you go straight to the pervy
place, don’t you?

Annie hurries onto the plane and hugs Max.

MAX
You okay?

ANNIE
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I’m changed
forever but I’m fine.
(then)
Is that a knife in your bullet
hole?

MAX
It’s nothing. Listen, I want us to
have a baby.

ANNIE
You sure?

MAX
Look at us. We did things tonight
we never would’ve imagined we could
do. And we were awesome.

(MORE )
109.

MAX (CONT'D)
I thought I wanted to be like
Brooks but it turns out Brooks is a
low-life and a loser.

BROOKS
Guilty.

MAX
Plus, think of all the dum-dums
having babies out there. Ours is
going to be so much better. It/’1l
beat them at everything.

ANNIE
(getting into it)
Totally. Our baby’s gonna crush
every other baby!

MAX
We’re gonna raise the Jason Bourne
of babies.

ANNIE
But without all the creepy
Treadstone flashbacks.

MAX
Right, no. Obviously.

Brooks starts slow-clapping. They look at him.

BROOKS
And that is how you throw a game
night.
Max and Annie stare.
MAX
What?
BROOKS

It went exactly as I planned.
(to the Bulgarian)
Trevor, you can get up now.

Max and Annie exchange an incredulous look and turn to the
Bulgarian. He doesn’t move. There’s a beat.

BROOKS (CONT'D)
I’m just fucking with you. That
would’ve been cool though, right?

MAX
Such a dick.
110.

EXT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
SUPER: “3 MONTHS LATER”

Max and Annie head toward Brooks’ rented house.

INT. BROOKS’ HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Max and Annie enter to find a game night in progress. Kevin,
Michelle, Ryan and Jillian play “Pictionary.” We see the
player at the easel is Gary.

They all yell greetings. Brooks hands Max a drink.

BROOKS
Thanks for letting me host again.

MAX
It’s not like we have a choice.

REVEAL that Brooks is wearing A BLINKING HOUSE ARREST ANKLE
BRACELET.

BROOKS
Only for another 36 months.

Brooks sits down on the sofa and puts an arm around DR. CHIN,
the fertility doctor.

DR. CHIN
Hi guys!

MAX
Hey, Dr. Chin.

KEVIN
(re: Gary’s drawing)
“The Crying Game”?

We see Gary’s drawing is of a man crying.

JILLIAN
“Boys Don’t Cry”?

MICHELLE
“Cry-Baby”?

Ryan’s phone BUZZER sounds.

RYAN
Time's up.

GARY
It was “The Green Mile.”
RYAN
How is that “The Green Mile”?!

GARY
That’s me at the Regal Cinema,
crying, as I did through much of

the film.

KEVIN
How are we supposed to know that,
Gary?!

GARY

I assume everyone cried during “The
Green Mile.”

RYAN
(whispering to Kevin and
Michelle)
How long till we can stop inviting
him again?

BROOKS
Who’s next?

ANNIE
I’ll go.

111.

Annie gets up and grabs the pen. She pulls out her clue,
reads it, tosses it behind her, nods for the timer, and

starts drawing a bread roll.

MICHELLE
A rock. A ball.

MAX
A burger. A bun!

She nods, then draws an oven around the bun.

GARY
Wait, is this a motion picture?

She ignores him.
MAX
Baking a bun. In an oven. There’s
a bun in the oven!

Annie touches her nose, smiling. Max jumps up,
his win, but then:

MAX (CONT'D)
Wait-- what?

He turns to Annie: she’s holding her stomach.

celebrating
112.
MAX (CONT'D)
You're pregnant?

ANNIE
We did it.

Max smiles and hugs her as everyone cheers and congratulates
them. WE MOVE OUT A WINDOW where the happy tableau plays out
in the living room.

Suddenly, an ominous BLACK VAN pulls to a stop in front of
the house as we SMASH TO BLACK.

THE END
