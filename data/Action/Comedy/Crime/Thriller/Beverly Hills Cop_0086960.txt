1 EXT. THE CITY OF DETROIT -~ HELICOPTER SHOT -- DAY 1
We HEAR a pounding, high energy Soul/Rock song that
captures the city heartbeat,

2 EXT. DETROIT STREETS -- VARIOUS ANGLES -= DAY 2
As the song continues we see quick images of Detroit:

3 A STEEL PLANT 3
dating from the turn of the century in full swing.

4 BURNED OUT TENEMENTS 4
in the shadow of new high rise hotels,

5 A BILLBOARD 5

put up by the United Auto Workers reading: "We don't like
your Japanese car. Park it in Tokyo.*

6 SEVERAL HOOKERS 6
in miniskirts wait outside an auto plant for the shift to
change.

7 A GROUP 7

of what politicians call the “hardcore unemployed" watch
kids keeping cool at an open fire hydrant.

8 EXT. A DETROIT STREET ~~ DAY 8

Decrepit, abandoned factories line the block; there's no
sign of life here. Halfway down the block, apparently
deserted, is a huge Peterbilt lé-wheel semi. The door of
the rear trailer is partially open.

9 INT. THE REAR TRAILER -- DAY g*

The trailer is packed, almost floor to ceiling, with cases
of cigarettes. There's a narrow aisle of sorts between the
stacks of cigarettes. Two small time hoods, CARLOTTA and
MIRSKY, stand in the center of the aisle, whispering to
each other,

CARLOTTA

I know Carlotta

And a case of cigarettes, dropped from overhead, narrowly misses
Carlotta and Mirsky, landing at their feet. AXEL FOLEY, a very
good=looking, out-going, totally unselfconscious man cf 23, hops
down INTO FRAME from the top of the stack of cigarette cases.

Axel is dressed very casually in a pair of jeans and a denim snirt.

AXEL
Come on now. Hey what do ya want to do.
Tell me something?

Axel rips open the case he’s tossed down from above, picks
a carton at random, tears it open, and hands Carlotta and
Mirsky a pack of cigarettes each.

CARLOTTA .
Give me a minute

AXEL
These are Lucky Strikes. Very popular
with the children. You got your federal
tax stamps on the back of every one.
They don't come any cleaner than this.
This is the best. Talk to me, gimme'
something.

CARLOTTA
So why don't you keep them, go into
business for yourself, it's such a
fucking good deal?

AXEL
Hey, man I don't know anybody in Detroit
that could handle a job this size. You
guyS are supposed to be connected in
this town,

Carlotta and Mirsky look at eachother, Carlotta turns the pack of
stolen cigarettes over and over in his hands.

AXEL
Listen, you do what you want. You don't
like the deal, just walk away. I'ma

Carlotta raises his eyebrows: Mirsky nods.

Communication breakdowns and what not,

JEFFREY
I don't understand.

JEFFREY FRIEDMAN, a twenty-eight year old detective, jumps
up from his kesk and hurries toward Axel. If Jeffrey wasn't
a friend, Axel probably would have shot him long ago. He's
a classic nudge and he never stops talking.

AXEL
I don't have time for you today,
Jeffrey.

JEFFREY

Todd's been looking for you all
day. He's really pissed. Says
this is your worst fuck-up yet.
But I think he's being unfair.

Axel glances toward a glassed-in office at the far end of

the room.

It's empty.

JEFFREY
He is not in.

AXEL
Yeah, I can see that, Jeffrey.

JEFFREY
I bet if you busted these guys, he
wouldn't be so mad. But I heard
you got caught up haggling about
the price or something.

AXEL
Two grand is too cheap for that
stuff. They would have known f

the barricades, bored.

Seven unmarked and marked Detroit police cars and two
wagons from the medical examiner's office are parked out

the buildings on both sides of hte street. Axel sits on

the stoop of the building, staring straight ahead. His
friend Jeffrey, pale and subdued, comes out of the building
and sits down beside Axel.

JEPPREY
You gonna be alright?
AXEL
I'm okay.
JEFFREY

You can stay at my place.

SGT LOU RAND, comes out of the building and walks down
the steps. He ignores Jeffrey but can't resist a snide
comment to Axel.

Axel, Taggart and Rosewood are sitting at a table right
by the strupper's runway. Taggart sits stonefaced with
his back to the runway. For Billy Rosewood, on the

other hand, this is like a Penthouse letter come to life.
he can't take his eves off the STRIPPER. The strincer
snaps the back of Taggart’s head with a feather boa. He
does his best to ignore it, A waitress approaches.

WAITRESS
Hi, can IT get you anything?

AXEL
Lemme have a scotch and soda.
Lite beer for you guys?

Two club sodas.

AXEL

Taggart's dick is hard but he

He hands a smaple of the coffee grounds to Taggart, who
exmanines it. Meanwhile Axel hands a dollar to Billy.

AXEL

The stripper dances up to Rosewood's dollar bill and
motions for him to stuff it in her G-string. Rosewpod's
too shy.

AXEL

Rosewood stuffs the bill in; Taggart turns around to see

the FIRST LEATHER COAT walks to the bar and orders a
drink, while the OTHFR moves to the far end of the room.
They both look around furtively, checking out the joint.
Only Axel notices this.

The waitress brings Axel, Taggart and Rosewood their
drinks. The stripper who has been pulling her feather
boa between her legs begins to seductively wrap it
around Rosewood's head.

There is panic in the bar until everyone settles down.
Axel gets up and still deigning drunkeness staggers

Axel, now within striking range, disables First Leather

Rosewood jumps up and pulls a gun on the First Leather

AXEL
Well, as you probably know, this
guy Maitland is a big shot art
dealer. He's always getting shipments
in from all over the world. Well,
I've been doing a little investigating
and it turns out some of these
shipments ain't exactly art. When I
was at his warehouse I saw some of
his guys unloading a crate of German
bearer bonds, which as you may or
may not know is a king of
untraceable international currency,
which coindidentally my friend
Mikey happened to have on him when
he was killed in Detroit.

BOGOMIL
Just because Maitland chooses to
invest in the same kind of bonds
that your friend had, doesn't exactly
make him a killer.

. AXEL
This guy's no inveator, he's a
smuggler, Sometimes, its bonds,
sometimes it's drugs. That crate never
passed through customs. Maitland
pays somebody off so his guys can
get the shipments out of customs
before they're inspected.

BOGOMIL
And what happens when customs finds
thase crates are missing?

AXEL

They never do. After Maitland's people
get their hands on them they take out
the bonds or drugs or whatever, fill
the crates up with newspapers and get
them back before customs gets a chance
to inspect them, all they find is the
Newspapers.

surmises they're reporting on what they found at the
gallery warehouse. As Axel watches, Bogomil comes down

the terrace steps and Taggart hurries up to report to him,

CHIEF HUBBARD

I'm standing in the middle of what
looks like a battlefield. We have
police on private property
without warrants, Mr. Maitland
and four other civilians are
dead. We have a detective from
Detroit whoa was supposed to
be escorted out of town by now
and you have a report that can
explain all of this.

~ LT. BOGOMIL
Yes, sir.

CHIEF HUBBARD
I'd very much like to hear it.

LT. BOGOMIL
Well, sir, Miss Jeanette Summers,
the manager of Mr. Maitland's art
gallery, accidentally discovered
large quantities of a substance
she suspected was cocaine in
the Art Gallery's warehouse.
She immediately communicated her
discovery te Detective Axel
. Foley of the Detroit Police force?

(he takes a breath)
Detective Foley was at the time
cooperating in a joint Beverly
Hills/Detroit investigation of
narcotics trafficking.

Hubbard's eyebrows shoot up, but he doesn't say anything.

LT. BOGOMIL
(continuing)
Detectives Foley and Rosewood
responding to Miss Summer’s report
proceeded to the warehouse where
Resewood did in fact discover
approximately eighty kilos of cocaine.

Hubbard's eyes shoot to Rosewood who is nervous and has
no idea where this wild tale is going.

LT. BOGOMIL .
(continuing)

At that point Maitland arrived and a
gunfight ensued, during which Miss
Summers was abducted by Maitland.
Rosewood immediately called for
backup and I dispatched our officers
ta this location. Sgt. Taggert here
was first to arrive at the scene.

Hubbard's eyes now land on a confused Taggart.

LT. BOGOMIL

(continuing)
Believing that Miss Summers was
in danger and having probable cause
to believe a felony was in progress,
Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood
with Detective Foley present as an
observer and proceeded to enter the
grounds. At this point a person or
persons on the property assaulted and
attempted to kill the officers by
firing on them. The officers returned
fire and in the course of lawfully
defending themselves the officers shot
several suspects, including Mr. Maitland.

CHIEF HUBBARD
You expect me to believe that
report?

LT. BOGOMIL
That's the report I'm filing,
sir.

Hubbard looks at Bogomil. Bogomil's eyes hold CHief Hubbard's
for a long moment. Chief Hubbard's expression isn't
readable. He turns to Taggart.

. CHIEF HUBBARD
Sgt. Taggart! Why don't you tell
me what happened here?

Rosewood's eyes widen with nervous anticipation.

SGT. TAGGART
It happened just like the lieutenant _
said, Chief.

Chief Hubbard’s expression isn’t readable. He walks over
to Axel.

CHIEF HUBBARD
And you! Do you go along with this,
this so-called report?

AXEL
Yes, sir. That's exactly the way
it happened. .
