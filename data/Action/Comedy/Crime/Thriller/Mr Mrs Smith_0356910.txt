John’s turn. He weighs the gun in his hand. He rolls his
neck. And... FIRES! BANG BANG! Bulls-eyes. Jane is surprised.
Impressed. He misses a couple for good measure.

JOHN
Hot damn,

He wings a small stuffed Boo Boo bear. He turns to go, but...

Silence. Shockingly EMPTY, QUIET. We FLOAT DOWN to reveal...
TITLE: Westchester County. Five or six years later.

EXIT, WESTCHESTER COUNTY ~ DAWN

Expansive green lawns with patchy snow and ice. A suburban
MAN in a bathrobe collects the newspaper. He looks up...
It‘s JOHN. Something's MISSING behind his eyes.

INT. SMITH HOUSE ~ BEDROOM - DAWN

A WOMAN rolls cut of bed, wearing a loose nightshirt, her
hair tied in a bun. JANE. The same dead stare.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAWN

John and Jane wear matching bathrobes with JS monograms. They
brush their teeth at separate sinks. No eye contact.

JANE
So what d‘'you think of Dr. Wexler?

JANE
Good. That's settled then.
INT. SMITH HOUSE ~ HALLWAY - DAWN
John and Jane pass each other, slipping on their coats. They
cross paths, without touching. They go their separate ways.
We HOLD on the empty hall. A lonely beat. The sun sets.
INT. SMITH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
PING! An oven door opens. Jane pulls out dinner.
EXT. TRAIN STATION - DUSK
A shrill WHISTLE. The commuter train pulls into station.
Spitting out a sea of upscale suburban COMMUTERS. Same suits,
same eyes, same lives. In the thick of this crush...John.

EXT. TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT ~ DUSK.

John finds his parked sedan. A black Benz. In a mass of other
sedans. Almost in unison, commuters climb into cars,

INT. JOHN'S CAR - DUSK

While other sedans rumble to life, John performs a ritual: he
SMELLS his hands. Pulls out air-freshener. Sprays his wrists.
Wrings his hands together. Then smells. Good.

Under the wheel, he slips his wedding RING out of a pocket,
onto his finger. He checks pockets. Patting himself down
fast. He STOPS when he sees what looks like red lipstick on
his cuff.

He checks his neck in the mirror. A smear of blood red
lipstick. Hmmm. Having an affair...?

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DUSK

John drives at the back of an endless line of sedans. He
drifts into the driveway. The garage door opens.

John spots Jane through a window. His HEADLIGHTS splash
across her face. They wave, smile. But as John pulls into
the garage, Jane’s smile slowly...fades.

INT. SMITH KITCHEN ~ DUSK

Jane slides hors d'ovevres onto a tray. She glides out,
turning the corner just as-—

Front door opens. Jane stands there, tray of food in hand.

JANE
Perfect timing.

JOHN
Perfect, as always.

A peck on the cheek. Barely touching.
JANE
Oh, John, I got us a tree. Biggest
on the block.

John nods. Not listening. Just moving, moving. Out. The back
door slams. And "SILENT NIGHT" trickles over--

EXT. SMITH BACKYARD - NIGHT

John moves across his trim back lawn towards his tool shed.
INT. TOOLSHED - NIGHT

Tooltime. John's tool shed is a mess. John sighs.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - HALL CLOSET - NIGHT

Boxes are tagged and filed. Jane slides out CHRISTMAS. She
Opens the box to reveal perfectly-packed ornaments, lights.

INT. SMITH LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jane places her ornaments on the MASSIVE TREE. Her hands move
fast. Agile, graceful. Little angels dance.

SNAP! She CRACKS a string of electric lights like a whip. The
lights wrap around the tree. SNAPPING into place.

INT. TOOLSHED / GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

John works his perennials, fixing stems. His big hands are
slow, delicate, tender. Every stem, every petal.

INT. SMITH LIVING ROOM ~ NIGHT
Jane stands on a chair, reaching up to put her star atop the
tree. But her chair is too low. So she steps onto the chair's

arms and LEEEEEANS, slanting straight up the tree. She drops
the star on top. And hits the floor, as John enters.

DR. WEXLER (V.0.)
Tell me. Why did you decide to come
back alone?
INT. DOCTOR WEXLER'S OFFICE - DAY
JANE IS THERE, ALONE, SMOKING.
JANE
It‘s not that there’s anything
wrong as such. You have to remember
John and I bonded on an intensely
profound spiritual level.
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Candies flicker. John and Jane sit at far heads of the
table. Distant, cold. No eye contact. No emotion.

JOHN
Mmm. This yellow Prawn risotto is
to die for. You do something new?

JANE
I added peas.

A hint of edge in her voice.

JOHN
Guess I just forget how good it is.

Weak smiles. Back to the food. A beat.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Could you pass the salt please?

JANE
It's on the middle of the table,
John.

JOHN

JANE
Well, it's between you and me.
You're on one side. I'm on the

SCREECH! John pulls out his chair. He gets up. He grabs the
salt. Heads back to his chair. Jane gives a tiny little
smile. A small victory. John sits back down. And he...

DROWNS HIS MEAL IN SALT. Jane swallows her smile. We get a
sense that every dinner is like this: cold, quiet, tense.

Huge wreath on the door. Merriment ECHOES beyond.

JOHN
Everything okay uptown?

JANE
Fine, good. You?

JOHN
Good, fine.

John rings the bell, which chimes “DECK THE HALLS." The door
swings open, revealing: SUZY and MARTIN CARLSON. They radiate
with the glow of new money, bad taste, and good whiskey.

SUZY AND MARTIN
Welcome neighbors!

INT. CARLSON'S HOUSE — NIGHT

The Carlsons lead John and Jane through a sea of SUBURBAN
COUPLES, MEN greet John with handshakes and backslaps. WOMEN

The perfect couple.

JANE
No, T...I...I-

But it’s too late. Mom pushes the Baby into Jane’s arms. Jane
holds the Baby awkwardly. Jane looks down into the Bahy’s big
blue eyes. So innocent, so pure.

Jane and the Baby just STARE at each other. Curious.

MOM #2

Babies see everything, you know.
MoM #3

It's as if they can see into your

The Mothers nod. Almost conspiratorial. Jane looks NERVOUS.
The Baby sizes her up. Eyes locked, focused, pensive. Eerie.
Jane smiles weakly, trying to win the Baby over. A beat.
And the Baby.........smiles., Even giggles.

MOM #4
She likes you.

Jane smiles back. A real, relieved smile. Through a haze of
cigar smoke, she sees...John. They lock eyes. No real
passion. A long way from their first glance, They both look a
little disgusted with each other. Suburban suckers.

a hundred feet above the ground from two ice axes, is a lithe
figure, dresaed like a white ninja.

BINOCULAR PCV. About half a mile away, the convoy approaches.

Shit. This guy’s rovalty.

JOHN

OK that's it. Say hello to my
little friend.

John appears from his hidey hole, the Javelin on his
shoulder. He fires it up.

PLUNK. The Javelin coughs out a massive heat-seeking warhead.
thirty feet out, it ROARS to life, spewing out a sheet of
flame, SCREAMING across the ravine at mach 3.

NORTH: JANE is transfixed. With no option, she drops off the
ledge into the freezing darkness.

The next millisecond the rocket slams into the snow-face. The
snow explodes with WITHERING FORCE, throwing up a hundred
foot ball of flame and causing an avalanche.

SOUTH: John looks down in awe at the object in his hand.

JOHN (CONT'D)
You should SO not be allowed to buy

snow crashes onto the highway. JANE hits the soft powder
hard, sixty feet below, loses her rifle and tumbles down the
slope.

handywork, when he hears an ominous low rumbling behind him.
Jane has DETONATED her charges. Blinking red.

John switches his headtorch on. The cliffs seems to be

A beat. And John emerges coughing, BY THE ROADSIDE. Through
the haze, we can see a THIRTY-CAR PILE-UP ON THE BRIDGE. It
looks like a CAR GRAVEYARD.

Moving across the highway, John reaches the median, where he
sees Jane: a small figure emerging from the avalanche snow-
pile down the road. She heads into a tunnel. John pursues.

INT. TUNNEL ~ NIGHT

Lit with the crackle and flash of downed electricity cables.
John enters a service corridor off the main tunnel.

John looks around. No sign of the figure. Then suddenly... a
SHADOW drops down BEHIND him from above. JANE’s eyes blaze
through the darkness as she attacks like a tiger.

A graceful spin and John's down from a reverse spinning
roundhouse. He goes for a gun but she hooks his hand between
her ankles in mid-air, FLIPPING him, sending the gun flying.

John tastes blood, raises his fists. They circle each other.
Feints, sudden moves. Black belt vs. Golden Gloves. Testing
for weaknesses. Ju jitsu kicks at ankles, knees. John throws
punch after punch, getting closer. She dodges but can’t stop
his onslaught. She drops, cracks both his shins with a half—
brick. He gasps in pain and falls to his knees.

 

Moving behind him she executes a neck hold, drags him towards |
a ragged steel pole sticking out of a discarded road sign.

John is choking. Jane pushes him towards the sharp metal
point, inches from his eye. John spets his gun five feet
away. Reaches behind and grabs the crotch of Jane’s pants.
Squeezes. No effect. What?

He twists his shoulders and relaxes his arms. They both fall
towards the spike but John angles himself, missing it and
SLASHING THE BACK OF JANE'S SHOULDER, She gasps in pain.

Suddenly free, John crawls towards his gun. He spins and
aims. Nothing. He looks around the silent darkness. Turns on
his head lamp: something disappears back into the tunnel.

He is met by the blinding light of a NIGHT SUN and the wind
and noise of A CHOPPER. He just catches a glimpse of his
adversary on a ROPE LADDER swinging under the huey before the
CHOPPER opens fire with a minigun, forcing him back into the
tunnel.

John falls to his knees and starts digging with his hands.
Soon he uncovers a corner of the laptop Jane dropped.

JOHN
Oho, what do we have here?

He opens the laptop.

JOEN (CONT'D)

John taps a single key and a smiley face pops up: PLEASE

fingers start counting down. The smiley face changes to a
frowny face and on zero puts its fingers in its ears.

for clues. Noting his wife's body. His eyebrows raise,
really looking at his wife, for the first time in years.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

Jane leads into the front hall. Shifting sideways, checking
mirrors. Never fully turning her back. John unzips his coat.

JANE
Here, let me help.

John tightens. But Jane slips off his coat. As she hangs it,
her HANDS smoothly FRISK the coat.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - DINING ROOM ~— NIGHT
The room is decked out. Candlelight. Romantic.

JOHN
You did all this for me?

JANE
I missed you.

JORN
I missed you too honey.

Jane holds the chair out for John. He sits. She takes the
napkin, gives it the tiniest of whipcracks and lays it on his
lap. John looks at her.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Why thank you.

JANE
Don’t mention it.

She walks around his back. He tenses. She skips out through

the kitchen door. John is left uncomfortably alone for a few
seconds before she reappears suddenly with a steaming roast.
She stands beaming. Behind her through the swinging kitchen

door John sees a bottle of Draino on the counter,

JOHN
Mmm. Pot roast. My favorite.

The carving knife lifts into view as Jane sharpens it. John
watches her every move. The KNIFE glints in her hand.

JCHN (CONT'D)
Sit down honey, I‘1l carve.

John disarms her. She sits. Steel cuts flesh. John serves.

JOHN (CONT'D)
So how was work?

Silence. Jane returns.
JANE
Oh same ol’ same ol’. Actually,

there was a little problem, with a
commission.

(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:

JOHN
A problem?

Jane rushes the net.

JANE
B double-booking. With another
consultant.

John pauses, forkful in hand, sees Jane watching, swallows.

JOHN
So the problem’s...solved?

JANE
Not yet. But don’t worry. It’s
nothing we can't handle.

Jane sees a BANDAGE ON JOHN'S EAR. HIS KNUCKLES: faint
ABRASIONS. A MEMORY FLASH: John throws PUNCHES in the TUNNEL.

BACK TO THE TABLE. John motions to the pot roast.

JOHN
Mmm. This is great. You do
something new?

JANE
You always ask if-

JOEN
I always forget how good it is,

An intensity to his words. New meaning now.

JANE
You sure you don't want any salt
with that?

John shakes his head. Eyes narrow, swallowing. Jane reaches
out toward her glass. A clean, straight line. A MEMORY FLASH:
A MATCHING MOVE FROM THE FIGHT IN THE TUNNEL. A perfect line.

 

RETURN TO DINNER. John swallows hard. Thinking.

JANE (CONT'D)
So tell me, how was your day?

JOHN

Had a problem with some figures.
Something didn’t add up.

{CONTINUED )

 
46.
CONTINUED: (2)

JANE
But you fixed them?

JOHN
Still working on it.

JANE
Important deal?

JOHN
Life or death, But we'll get there.
It's just a matter of time.
They lock eyes.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I almost forgot. I bought you a
present.
Jane distrusts. Covers.
JANE
For me? John! What have you done
with my husband?

She opens the package, maybe expecting a trick. But what she
finds is: a beautiful sleek black dress.

JANE (CONT'D)
It's beautiful.

JOHN
Why don’t you try it on?

INT. BEDROOM ~ NIGHT

Jane slips her clothes off and slips the dress on. She looks
in the mirror: it's beautiful. She turns: IT'S BACKLESS ~
across her shoulder is the SCAR from last night. she spins
around. John is in the doorway.

JOHN
So what do you think?

JANE
Sohn you shouldn't have.

He smiles.

JOHN
Honey, you deserve it.

CONTINUED:

He approaches her and steps close, their lipe almost brush,
millimeters apart. Jane spins around John, distracting him
for a second so he completely misses his chance to look at
her shoulder. She smiles.

JANE
So how do I look?

She stays close, pushing her body against his. Lecking eyes.

JOHRN
Like a whole new woman.

John holds her close. Behind her back, he looks at the
reflection in his wine glass. The light catches it. And...

John drops the glass. We zoom in to the glass as it falls. AN
AVALANCHE OF MEMORIES. LIGHTNING-SPEED, STYLIZED FLASHES span
three seconds:

FLASHBACK: TEE HOTEL IN HOGOTA ~ DAY

John and Jane in the hall. Their first meeting. Approaching
each other. John tucks in his shirt.

And we SWIVEL FAST AROUND HIM...to see him tuck a tiny
revolver into his belt.

Jane smooths her skirt. We SWIVEL FAST AROUND HER...to see
her slip a thin blade into her stocking. And we’re back at~-

THE STREET MARKET IN BOGOTA. REVERSE MOTION. The bullet PULLS 108A
our of Sancho Varron. Flying backward high-speed into...

The barrel of a gun. A quick flash of an EYE IN THE
SCOPESIGHT. JANE’S EYE.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

John looks into the same eye. Silence. His glass finally HITS
the ground. SHATTERING. Staining the rug BLOGD RED, John and
Jane push back.

JANE
I‘ll get a towel-

JOHN
No, I'll get it.

 
48.

INT. DEN -— NIGHT

He shuts the door behind him. Panting. Mind racing. A door
SLAMS shut 0.S. John flinches. Bar to the door. Nothing. He
rips open his desk. Hidden compartment. Pulls out a silencer,
clip, pistol. THWACK. Gun assembled. On his hip.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Candles flicker. An empty room. John on high alert.

JOHN (SWEETLY}
Honey...?

He moves from room to room. Blood beating. He hears: THE
GARAGE DOOR OPENING.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A LIGHT SNOW FALLS. SCREEECH! Jane's wagon broadsides round
the bend leaving a wake of snow. SCREEECH! John's sedan
slingshots around the corner, onto the interstate highway--
EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The chase is on. John and Jane weave through traffic. Jane's
wagon shudders at the speed.

JOHN
That's my wife. My goddamn wife.

John gains ground. 90,95 MPH. Trying to gather himself.

JANE (TO HERSELF)
You Lied to me.

She drops a gear and floors it. The engine roars.

John PUNCHES the gas harder. Weaving. He catches up to her.
They SWERVE toward each other.

JOHN
Don't dent the Honda. Don’t dent
the fuckin’ Honda.
Fighting for a lane. Their CARS bump and grind. SPARKS FLY.
JOHN (CONT'D)

Great. Trash every car we own why
don‘t cha?

(CONTINUED)
49,
CONTINUED:

John swerves around a van and draws level. Jane sees the
silenced gun in his hand on the wheel.

JANE
Shit. He’s armed.

She reaches under her seat and pulls out a Sig and high
capacity clip. She locks and loads. John looks across.

JOHN
Shit. She's packin'.

He PUNCHES the brake, swerves in behind her. She stamps on
the brakes.

John, tail-gating, sees the “KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!” sticker fly
toward him. On impact, he accidently squeezes off a round. A

9mill slug ZINGS through his windscreen, through ten feet of

freezing country air, and through the Honda’s rear window.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Now look what you made me do,

Jane flinches as a round passes her ear, out the windshield.

JANE
You bastard!

She swivels in her seat and empties Ten Massive .45 calibre
xounds behind her which SING into John's car. John eats
passenger seat, showered with broken glass.

JOHN
That's it. Over-react.

John accelerates and moves into her lane. His car is bigger,
stronger. She BOUNCES away.

JANE
Get out of my lane goddamn it.

Jane opens fire again. John ducks down again.

JOHN
That‘s it. That’s the tin lid.

He reaches over and pulls a plastic GAS CAN from the
footwell. He tears off his shirt-arm, stuffing it in and
screwing the lid back on.

JOHN (CONT'D)
See how you like it.

(CONTINUED )

 
50.
CONTINUED: (2)

Jchn puts pedal to metal. 115, 120. Edging ahead, he lights
the fuse on his makeshift gas~bomb and hurls it out the
window. It hits the center of Jane‘s windshield EXPLODING on
impact, wreathing her hood in flames.

Jane can’t see for fire. She stays cool, hunching down in her
seat, swapping her hand for her foot on the gas. She braces
both feet against the windshield and KICKS, it neatly pops
out.

John sees the flaming glass cartwheel toward him. He BRAKES
HARD, as it catches his side door. Jane smiles.

Frustrated, John FLOORS IT. Side by side, they lock eyes at
125MPH. A flicker of...electricity...attraction? John shouts.

JOHN (CONT'D)
We need to talk!

Jane SLAMS HER BRAKES, as John SWERVES TOWARD HER. So... John
SWERVES PAST THE FRONT OF HER CAR at 130MPH. He looks ahead
to see: AN OFF-RAMP INCOMING. He fishtails. SMASH! He SLAMS
INTO THE RAMP WALL. CRASHING through the concrete.

He swallows hard, shutting his eyes. As his car goes
AIRBORNE! FLYING OFF THE RAMP. SOARING THROUGH THE NIGHT.
NOSE~DIVING into the Hudson. IMPACT. SPLASH!

The car sinks fast. LIGHT hits the water. Jane stands on the
bank: police maglight on her left shoulder, pistol in her
right hand sweeping the river. No sign of John. A beat.

Still no John, No bubbles... She hears SIRENS. COPS incoming.
With a last glance at the river, Jane drives into the night.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

Water swirls. Beyond the waves...on the cther side of a rusty
old buoy... John bobs, Alive. His eyes flash. Not so much
angry aa... IMPRESSED. Impassioned. Ready for war.

We hear a DING DONG on the CUT To--

INT. EDDIE'S HOUSE ~ NIGHT

Eddie slowly opens his front door to see: John, beaten,
bleody, rancid from the river.

EDDIE

51.

Ichn sits opposite Eddie at the little breakfast table, Eddie

looks like he’s digesting an albatross.

EDDIE

John sips a beer,
EDDIE (CONT'D)

No I mean really. What are the
chances of that happening?

JOHN
Well it’s happened.
EDDIE
So she was doing this from the
start?
JOHN
I cannot believe that woman.
EDDIE
How many people you do think she's
killed?
JOHN

What do you mean?

EDDIE
Well do you think she’s killed more
than you? I mean she could have.
She could have killed way more.

JOHN
Goddamn it Eddie.

EDDIE
Well one of you has, and it could

JOHN

John is dealing.

EDDIE
How d‘you suppose she kept it from
you all these years?

JOHN
Lots of couples have secrets.

EDDIE
No. Lots of couples have dogs. What
you got is a fuckin’ Tyranosaurus
Rex.

John stares at the table.

JOHN
I can’t believe she lied to me.

EDDIE
You weren’‘t exactly playin’
straight yourself.

JOERN
That's completely different. I
married that woman because I loved
her.

EDDIE
Well do you still love her? Wait
don't answer that. You should sleep
on this. You're both upset.

JOHN
Upset? My wife wants to kill me.

EDDIE
That‘s not so unusual.

JOHN
She fired fifteen shots into my car
and drove me off the road into the
Hudson.

(CONTINUED)
53.

EDDIE
Okay, that less usual. But trust
me. Right now she's probably as
confused as you are. Hurt.
Vulnerable.

JOHN
She didn’t seem too vulnerable.

EDDIE
Jast get some sleep, and in the
morning go see her, Talk to her,
buy some flowers, be nice to her...

JOHN
You don’t understand Eddie. She
ID'd me. On a hit. Get it?
Eddie’s expression darkens. John nods. Eddie exhales shaking
his head. John is in ten kinds of agony. They both clearly
know what this means. It's heavy. Really heavy.
EXT. SMITH HOUSE NEIGHBORHOOD ~- DAWN

Fresh carpet of snow. A PAPERBOY pedals his bike, throwing
papers. A paper hits the SMITH HOUSE. A picture-perfect home.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAY

The sweet suburban home has been turned upside down: Jane's
girls check John's mail, trash, bills, boxes.

JULIE
Pocket litter. Receipts.
Matchbooks. You know the drill.
INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

PHOTO albums cover the sofa. Jane picks up a photo of her

JANE

I don’t know WHO he is.
Jane's volce rose. She catches herself. composes herself.
JANE (CONT'D)
He's a security risk, he knows me,
he’s compromised everyone here.
JASMINE
Are you sure? Are you sure you
aren’t compromising everyone now?
Jane opens her mouth. But there ia no easy answer this time.
JASMINE (CONT‘D)
You know, you‘re not the first girl
in the world to find out her life’s
a lie.

JANE
Yeah, but I thought it was my lie.

INT. SMITH HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY ~ DAY

Jane drifts through empty halls. Looking at her home...as if
for the first time. She stops at a photo of her and John
smiling at Coney Island. She hardens. And hears HER VOICE...

it in the garbage can.

JANE
Okay ladies, this room’s wrapped.

The women file out, exchanging looks.

The hanging bulb sparks to life. Women spread out. Popping

FOOTSTEPS. ECHOES UNDERFOOT. She KICKS down. More echoes.
INT. TOOLSHED LOWER LEVEL - DAY

Jane leads her team into...JOHN'S ARSENAL. They shine MAG-

INT./EXT. SMITH HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Associates load a black van with pillowcases and sheets
FILLED WITH WEAPONS. They drop them into their black vans, On

HOPSCOTCH GIRL

The girls smile, satisfied. Hopscotch away. Future killers.
Jane stares after them. Closes the door on the empty hallway.

JANE {CONT'D)
Audio scan civilian frequencies.

JESSIE

Jane pulls out a MICROCASSETTE. It looks high-tech. But look
closer. Jane plays the tape.

JOHN (ON TAPE}
Hi, you've reached John and Jane
Smith. We're not at home right now

John's WEDDING BAND. Inside is a single bullet.

JANE
He's here...

On screen, they check FLOORS. HALLS. WALLS. EMPTY.

Jane punches keys for CEILING heat sensors. The program
flashes a 3-D GRID of the vents. A thermal image MOVES though
the vents.

The women see the DOT. They slowly stare up at the ceiling.
Silent. Waiting for a sound, a move. SUDDENLY... RINGGGG!
Jane's cellphone rings. She snaps it open.

JANE (CONT'D)
I thought I told you not to bother
me at the office.
Jane spins in place, staring up at the ceilings. Where is he?
JOHN (ON PHONE)
First and last warning, Jane. You

JANE
I’m not going anywhere.

JOHN (ON PHONE)
We'll see about that.

A METALLIC BOUNCE OVERHEAD.

All eyes follow the sound across the ceiling...down the wail
to..-an AIR VENT where...A TINY GRENADE drops out. Across the
floor. All eyes go wide, Milliseconds to death.

JOHN (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
Bang. You’re dead.

Jane keys a command. Stations ERASE HARD DRIVES. Sim cards
are ripped from phones and files are stuffed in an oil drum
into which a passing girl drops an incendiary. WOOF! Evidence
gone. The women lunge out the back PRIVATE EXIT.

Jane is last in. She turns back. Watching to see through
smoke and swirling debris...

John drops down from the ceiling. Hardware hangs on his hips
and shoulders. An epic tableau, Just as he turns, making eye
contact with Jane... CLICK. Her steel decors shut.

John steps back into the open elevator. He hits BASEMENT. As
the doors shut, he sweeps his wedding ring off the ground.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Jane and team run out of their elevator. They head for BLACK
VANS. But Jane pauses, HEARING something in the distance.
Her eyes narrow, sensing...John.

JASMINE
Janel

As the girls pile into the vans, Jane steps into the flat
expanse of the garage. Flickering fluorescents. Endless cars.
She hears that sound, a distant CAR ENGINE, getting louder.

Jane holds a gun to her hip, tracking the ECHO, down rows of
cars. She sweeps around a corner. But the floor is empty. She
spins in place. A long, tense beat. Suddenly--

TIRES SQUEAL:! A 4x4 powers around the corner. GATHERING
SPEED. DRIVING STRAIGHT AT HER. John at the wheel.

JOHN
Now that‘s what I’m talking about.

He drops a gear and floors it. Jane assesses the terrain,
raises her gun, stands her ground. A bull-fighter.

She steadies her aim. John bears down. 30 yards, 20... Jane
stands her ground. Smiles. And FIRES! Straight at... THE
HEADLIGHT. The headlight?

The light blows. And we FOLLOW the pulse of electricity...
into the engine, pistons, circuits, red lights racing to...
the STEERING WHEEL. Which EXPLODES! Into an air bag.

Jane sways out of the way like a matador as the 4x4 slides
INCHES past her waist, SMASHING head-on into a pillar.

John SLASHES the airbag with a punch-knife and rolls out.
Jane EMPTIES her clip at the truck. BANGBANGBANG! CLICK. John
heard the telltale CLICK. He looks up, and sees...

Jane running down a ramp. She leaps over a divide between
levels, hits the ground without breaking stride, racing to--

INT. CAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Hydraulic car storage bins, Empty bins starts to COMPRESS.
The roof lowers, leaving only a foot of crawlspace. Like 4
wide, metal coffin.

Jane leaps into the bin, which starts to RISE ap toward
street~level. Gears CREAK and HISS.

SUDDENLY! BAM! John's HAND GRABS HOLD of the far end of the
bin. He pulls himself up, rolling in next to Jane. The bin
compresses further. They breath in. Claustrophobia. The
ceiling stops dead.

John and Jane lay on their backs. Side by side. Their noses
touching the top of the bin. Trapped.

John tries to pull his gun. CLANG! His gun is in the OUTSIDE
HAND. No room. The other hand flicks out his punch dagger.
Jane spots this, grabs his hand and applies locking pressure
to John's wrist. He gasps in pain and drops the dagger which
she retrieves and flips around in her fingers.

With no room to defend himself, John thinks fast and PUSHES
his entire body against hers, jamming her arms by her sides
against the walls. Body to body.

JANE,
Well this is a new experience.

JOEN
You mean it's dark, we’re alone,
and you don't have a headache.

Sweating. Nose to nose. The elevator GRINDS to a halt.

JANE (CONT'D)
You know, you could make this real
easy on yourself-

JOHN
What, you expect me to just roll

JANE
I had to for six years of marriage.

I never knew you were saving your
best moves for the field.
JANE
Believe me baby... you haven't seen
my best moves yet.
JOHN

I can hardly wait.

JANE
You won't have to...

The elevator hits the GROUND FLOOR. The roof starts to rise.
The second Jane has the space, she moves: in one fluid motion
JANE SLIPS OUT OF HER COAT, PULLS IT OVER JOHN'S HEAD,
blocking his view. SHE SLIDES OUT.

John tries to wiggle out, but he has to WAIT for the roof.
He needs more leeway than Jane. He hope out. And sees—~

John looks up.

With the CAR PLUMMETING, John KICKS cpen the EMERGENCY HATCH

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

THE ROOF of the FALLING ELEVATOR. John WHIPS his BELT AROUND
THE CABLE. The cable runs through at terrifying speed making
the leather smoke. Below we see the severed counterweight
cable unravelling and SNAKING ITS WAY UP THE SHAFT. John
braces himself. As the tip of the parted cable passes like a
wire ball, it catches his belt, pulling him up.

HE SCREAMS IN PAIN AS HE EXPERIENCES MASSIVE G-FORCE. Having
dropped nearly 30 floors he now flies upwards 40.

But John HOLDS TIGHT, RIDING the snaking cable UP through the
shaft as the elevator falls away beneath him, filling the
darkness with the sound of WHISTLING METAL. As he nears the
top he sees the cable ripping through huge smcking pulleys.

He braces as he reaches the pulley. The belt gets pulled
through, WHIPPING John UP into the GLASS ATRIUM! WHAMM! He

People gape at the elevator crash site. Twisted steel.
Nuclear damage. Jane and team emerge from the stairwell. Jane

Closed another deal, did you?

JANE

Yes. I did.

Jane sits down at a table for one. She stares around the
room. COUPLES, FAMILIES, in love. She sips her champagne.

Very much alone. On Christmas Eve. A single tear rolls down
her cheek. She gulps her champagne. Reaches for the bottle.

The waiter comes over to ask if he should set another place.
Using the distraction, John grabs a napkin in ONE SEAMLESS
MOVE, shifts under his coat, snatches a GLOCK with one hand,
drops it into his lap and wedges it under the table.

Jane knocks her handbag off the table and bends over to pick
it up PALMING a silenced FINGER-GUN in her left hand and

like it?

JANE
I liked Ginger. But not Fred.

You don't like Fred Astaire?!

He's all flash. Not sharp enough.

She could be describing John. She hits a mark. WHAM! Edge

JOHN
Ginger was nobody, nothing without
Fred.

Dust and debris waft around them. Trigger fingers tighten.
They circle each other. Their eyes locked. HAMMERS COCKED.

And CRACK! A frame falle. On instinct, they GLANCE, And see
ragged photos and mementoes strewn everywhere. Their life
stares out at them. Their home. They lock eyes again.

Eyeball to eyeball. Real, raw, point blank. Something about
the way John looks at Jane is different, emotional, off.
Time freezes. The barrel shakes on his gun.

John looks into his wife's eyes. And he cannot pull the
trigger. So he slowly...lowers...his...barrel,

Jane blinks sweat out of her eyes. Confused, suspicious. Her
eyes flit fast, looking for tricks. But what she sees is...

Old photos. Knick-knacks. A lifetime of memories. Young John

Starting to crack. And slowly....her trigger finger...
LOOSENS. CLICK. She...drops her gun.

AND LUNGES...INTO..-A KISS.

John and Jane COLLIDE. All of the tension and thrill of the

She looks angelic in the morning sun. John and Jane stare at

each other, as if seeing one another for the first time.

This is the best it's ever been. And perhaps...the best it

will ever be. Because...the beat passes. And John sees...

A RED DOT on JANE'S FOREHEAD. A laser sight.

John checks the rear-view mirror,

That car behind us look a little
close to you?

A SLEEK, SILVER BMW SEDAN CHARGES toward them!

CONTINUED:

Assassin works the wheel, shiting the clutch brilliantly. He
reaches cut with an AUTOMATIC, FIRES at the minivan, SHREDS
the back door.

Jane grabs John’s 45. She climbs into the passenger section.
AND BING CROSBY CROONS OVER THE FOLLOWING ACTION:

Jane crawls on her stomach, POPPING down two rows of
RECLINING SEATS. She sloooowly RECLINES THE LAST ROW, USING
THE SEAT-BACK AS A SHIELD. She aims over the seat at...

The Assassin’s BMW. Jane FIRES! But John SWERVES wildly,
darting around TRAFFIC. Jane’s BULLETS miss high and wide.

JANE
JOHN! HOLD STEADY!

John struggles to control the minivan. A heavy load.

JOHN
Transmission’s terrible! How the
hell do people drive these things?!

Jane sees...A BLACKED-OUT EXPLORER swing into lane, joining
the hunt. TWO YOUNG KILLERS in the front seats. More suits.
Jane’s eyes narrow. Thinking. She crawls back to the front.

JANE
Give me the wheel. John...

He pauses. He wants to be in control. Jane reagons:

JANE (cont'd) (CONT'D)
I drive a station-wagon and a van.
I know how to drive these things.
(extending the 45)
And this is what you da.

John looks at her. Motions to the wheel.

JOHN
Take it.

As John and Jane shift positions, their bodies BRUSH. Flesh
twisting, turning. Intimate, sexual. For a split-second...
They get caught up in the heat. And WHAM! The Assassin SLAMS
into the minivan. SNAPPING John and Jane back to action.

John crawls into the back, Jane adjusts the rear~-view mirror
to her height. Her eyes narrow, focused. Ready to battle with
her suburban tank. She SPEEDS up the ON-RAMP to--
88.

EXT. I-95 HIGHWAY - DAY

John AIMS over the back row of seats, Heavy machine-GUNFIRE
explodes from the Explorer. Eating windows from the rear.

The Assassin switches gears, RACING up the DRIVER-SIDE.

JOHN
Incoming! YOUR SIDE!

Jane checks her side-view-mirror.

JANE
Hold cn!

John grabs a seat belt, Jane reaches back over her shoulder.
She hits the SIDE-DOOR LOCK. She PUNCHES the BRAKES,

And the SIDE-DOOR SLIDES OPEN. Giving John a CLEAR SHOT!

 

John FIRES point-blank! Bullets SHOOT through the Assassin's
passenger-side windowe,. WHIZZING by his head.

In one fluid motion: the Assassin HITS his brakes, SWINGS
around the back of the van, and HAMMERS the gas. Speeding up
along the other side of the van. But he finds a surprise:

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VAN HAS A SLIDING DOOR TOO. JOHN IS
WAITING. DOOR OPEN. GUN HIGH. BLAM! The Assassin VEERS HARD!

Fuming, the Assassin SWERVES at the minivan. But the van is
too strong. His BMW BOUNCES off. Jane’s eyes narrow.

JANE (CONT'D)
Buckle up, John.

John straps on a seatbelt. And Jane SWERVES HARD! SLAMMING
into the SIDE OF THE BMW! The BMW doors BUCKLE. The minivan’s
doors hold STRONG! TOTALLY INTACT.

JANE (CONT'D)
Steel-reinforced side-impact
intrusion-beams. Standard on all
799 minivans.

John looks at her. How the hel} did she know that?
JANE (CONT'D)

Those dinner-parties are starting
to pay off.

CONTINUED:

The Assassin tries to PUSH OFF the minivan. But the van is
too heavy. Jane is PLOWING the BMW ACROSS THE HIGHWAY, TOWARD
THE EDGE OF AN OVERHANG, Suburban is beating urban.

The Assassin is trapped, helpless. He reaches out with his
gun, FIRING at the minivan‘’s wheels. BLOWING out a FRONT
TIRE!

But Jane HITS THE FOUR-WHEEL~DRIVE FUNCTION. And her BACK-
WHEELS smoke into motion. PUSHING the BMW all the way to...

THE EDGE OF THE OVERHANG. WHAM!! The Assassin’s car SLAMS
through the low stanchion. Flies off the overhang!

THE BMW PLUMMETS FIFTY FEET, TWISTING AND TURNING IN THE AIR.
The Assassin looks over his shoulder as...BOOOM! The BMW
erashlands! EXPLODING into chunke of churning, burning metal.

BAM!!! THE EXPLORER is attacking. AUTOMATIC CHATTER BLASTING!

Instantly, Jane stomps on the brake and swerves left before
swerving right and SIDESWIPING the Explorer. But the EXPLORER
HOLDS STRONG. Built for off-roading.

A Killer reaches out toward the minivan and OPENS the sliding
side door of the van.

JANE (CONT'D)
We got more company John! Incoming!

John moves fast, as the Killer JUMPS from his car into the
back of the minivan. John simply pushes open the opposite
door and SHOVES him straight THROUGH the van, cut the other
side. He FALLS off an overhang. FIFTY FEET! SPLAT.

JORN
And...outgoing. God, these doors
are handy!

The Killer left in the Explorer RAMS them. Jane RAMS back.
John is knocked off his feet and nearly falls out.

JOHN (CONT'D)
Whoa there ned.

Jane smashes into the attacker, RIPPING her steel bumper into
the Explorer, destroying the entire side of the SUV.

JANE
Eat bull bars bitch.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

John hangs onto the floor of the van for dear life. Road
rushes past both open rear doors. The Explorer Killer FIRES
full breach at John.

JOHN
Danger. I’m in danger here.

Jane starts to RAM again. The Explorer swings toward the van.
But Jane SLAMS HER BRAKES! A signature move. And the Explorer
SWERVES straight PAST the minivan, into the divide.

The Agent slams his brakes, but WHAM! SMASHES INTO A CONCRETE
STANCHION. EXPLODING into flames. Jane drives past him.

John and Jane drive off into the horizon. In a beat-up
minivan. Bing Crosby's song comes to a resounding climax.

JOHN (CONT'D)
We have got to get one of these.

As they drive away from the FLAMING WRECKAGE, we FADE OUT.
A beat of SILENCE. Darkness. Peace. And FADE IN:

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

The shoulder. We hear a plaintive SQUEAK. The sound of metal
on concrete. And...the MINIVAN rolls into frame. Tires
shredded, Rims destroyed. Just beat to shit.

The minivan slows to a stop. Dead. Bing Crosby fades out.

INT. MINIVAN — DAWN

John and Jane sit in silence. The quiet after the storm.
They stare into the distance.

The sun rises over the road ahead, leading to wilderness,
suburbs. Behind them, the city skyline looms large.

John and Jane sit, with cars whooshing past. Awkward, silent.
John slowly looks at Jane, He puts his toe in the water:

JOEN
You were pretty good. Back at the
house.

Jane is a little defensive. Holding tight.

JANE
What did you expect?

John shrugs.

JANE
No kidding.

A beat. John looks at her. A step deeper:

JOEN
The way we worked together. It
was...

JANE

"Pretty good.” Yeah... Where are
you going with this, John?

He shrugs. Not ready to dive in.
JOHN
I mean, they’re after both of us.
And you know, strength in numbers.

She slowly turns to him. Eyebrow cocked slightly. She needs
him to say it. He swallows.

JOHN (CONT'D)
We just try it... You know.
Teamwork.

She looks out the window, considering. John watches her.

JANE
(without looking at him)
For now.
John plays it cool.
JORN

Right. See how it goes.

JANE
Yeah, see how it goes.

A beat. John and Jane look out their windows. And...
The trial begins.

Jane and John sit, looking hunted, drinking terrible coffee.
Jane looks from customer to customer. Paranoid. She knows the
next attack could come from anywhere.

John sits still, trying not to say the one thing he wants to
say. Finally, he cracks:

JOEN
So how many?

JANE
John, please.

JOHN
I just want to know-

JANE
We’re on the run from countless
assassins right now. It’s really
not the best time-

JOHN
Just give a number. Then I won't
ask anything else, I promise. How
many? How many before me?

Jane looks away. Checking the crowd. All suspicious. The Lady
with the Christmas sweater? The Old Man with the cane?

JOHN (CONT'D)
How about if I go first?

Jane knows this is the only way to move on.

JANE
Fine. Go ahead.

JOHKN
I don’t exactly keep count. But I’d
say we‘re talking...fifty. Maybe
sixty. I been around the block. So
how about you? Just ball-park.
She checks the crowd again. Then:

Three hundred and twelve.

John goes pale.

JOHN

She shrugs.

JANE
Some were two at a time.

A long beat. Finally...
JOHN
Are you counting innocent
bystanders in that?
Jane shakes her head, annoyed. And we CUT TO:
EXT. MCDONALDS PARKING LOT - DAWN
John and Jane stride across the lot. Jane is ten yards ahead.
JOHN
(still struggling)
How'd you find time to shop?

JANE
Enough.

CRASH! Jane SMASHES a window, to steal a car.

JANE (CONT'D)
Get in.

As John slides in, the engine HUMS to life.
INT. CAR ON HIGHWAY - NIGHT

the window, still struggling with the Number.

no job, no office. And my wife has

JANE

JOHN
I feel so naive. I feel so naive

John looks at Jane, realizing how little he knows. This is

“Fantasy Tsland.”

Jane is trying to stay professional here.

JANE
Sorry.

They drive a beat in-silence. No eye contact. And then:

JANE (CONT'D)
All we need is something to trade
for our lives. Something the boss
wants more than he wants us,

John keeps his eyes out the window. Distant,

JOHN
Where we gonna find that kind of

Right under where he was sitting, a metal panel in the floor
pops up, and Jane appears. She has been hiding in the wiring
cavity under the floor.

She opens a titanium suitcase, Inside is a laptop and comma
kit. She ethernets onto the network and hacks the main

JANE

Snow White in place, how are the

YOUNG FBI AGENT
Anybody hungry?

The two Agents OPEN THE DOOR TO THE BUNKER, letting their

opportunity.

JANE
We had a plan. You deviated.

Honey... C’mon, Do I have to trust

Okay, Hector. Look at me...

Hector is looking at Jane. Her legs.

Hey. Look at me, Hector. And answer
the question: why’d the CIA want

front of Hector. What? I’m just
saying. It sends a mixed message.

JANE
Trust me, I don‘t need to
“undermine” you. You‘re doing a
good job of that, all on your own.
John tightens. He holds out his gun. Think you can do better?

JOHN
Nice, Go ahead.

She shakes her head.

JANE
I don’t need that.

John can't help but smile. She looks at Hector. Her eyes

Jane‘s hand is on his shoulder, rubbing softly.

Hector is sweating. Jane is so close he can taste her.

Closer, closer. Her lips part. And one word escapes:

Totally alone.

JANE (0.S.)
What happened in there?

He turns to see Jane. In the doorway. Her hair messed. One
more button open on her blouse. John is cold.

JOHN
You tell me.

JANE
You lost your cool.

JOHN
Yeah well maybe it's not so easy to

Wait seriously, do I know your

She turns to him. Doesn't answer. That’s a “no.”

JANE
Hector Danz.

She lights up. A drag.

JANE (CONT'D)
His name's Hector Danz. He was an
accountant for the CIA. Ran all the
books for freelance hitters. They
were using independents, like us,
on domestic targets.

Another drag. John just stares at her.

JANE (CONT'D)
FBI was onto the operation. They
got Hector's books, convinced him
to testify...against the man who
runs our chapter. Name's Mr.
Horner. And he’s got access to the
top fifty hitters in the United
States. Who are all after us now.

A beat. John stares at Jane. Dealing.

You were in there for like fifteen
seconds. How’d you get all that?

JANE

Except each other. They're not

searches for a solution. Quiet, resolved. Finally:

JOHN
Well then, I guess we've gotta take
them out.
Jane looks back at him.

Honey, six days ago, you thought I

John roils, emotional.

JANE
You ran it into the river. While

JOHN
You slipped out of the house. Not
me. That's you. Always avoiding
things.

JANE
John. I didn't blow up the one
thing that could save us.

JOHN
Jane. It wasn't my idea to get
Hector.

JANE
So this is my fault?! This is my
fault now?

JOHN
(snapping)
No, it’s my fault. It‘s all my
fault. It’s my fault we met. It's
my fault we moved in. And it's
definitely my fault we got married.

Fuck. Right away, he wishes he could take the last sentence

JANE
No, John. That was both our faults.

A hard beat. On the edge of the dark highway.

SOHN
Look. Husbands and wives lie to
each other all the time. It doesn’t

Doesn't it?

So tell me one thing that’s true.
One thing you really mean...

She needs something meaningful here. John opens his mouth.
But nothing comes out. He doesn’t know what to say. Jane
shakes her head, disappointed.
JANE (CONT'D)
You were right... I don’t know you
at all.
She turns around. A beat. Miles away. John searches, Finds:

I’m sorry...

Something he wants.

EXT. MOTEL — PAYPHONE ON HIGHWAY —- NIGHT

Jane hangs up. No sign of John. She looks at the horizon, The
sun rises, blood red. A cold wind blows. Jane drops her
cigarette, and stomps it out. Hard.

EXT, IKEA SUPERSTORE - DAY
See the Christmas shoppers. Smell the new paint. And enter-—
INT. IKEA SUPERSTORE. DAY.

John enters ALONE. His eyes shift from customer to customer.
Potential assassins everywhere. That guy over there looking
at the bunkbeds. The couple paying for garden furniture.

John walks slow. Wary. Eyes shifting. Hands running through
soft furnishings. And then...

VOICE (0.8.)
Mr. Smith.

John turns to face MR, HORNER: a very ordinary man carrying a
very ordinary basket of goods. He smiles broadly, Terrifying.

JOHN
Mr. Horner.

His smile tightens, realizing John knows his name. John's
eyes keep moving, checking the customers, sightlines.

MR. HORNER
Looking for your wife?

A hanging beat.

MR. HORNER (CONT'D)
She tell you she’d take the back
route? Meet you in the middle?

John stays quiet. He looks at Mr. Horner. That scary smile.

MR. HORNER (CONT'D)
I don’t think she‘ll be joining us.
Except to pick up her payment.

JOHN
What are you talking about?

MR. HORNER
We always knew she was the better
hitter. Of course, it took her a
little longer than usual to clean
the scene this time. But at least
she finished what she started.

John looks gutpunched. His eyes scanning. He sees the store
filled with suspicious moves, bulges. Quiet:

JOHN
Looks like the gang’s all here.
Mr. Horner smiles, nods good-naturedly.

MR. HORNER
You know, I had a wife once...

He trails off. We can only imagine what happened to his wife.
JOHN
How much? How much did she get for
serving me up?
Mr. Horner pats a BAG in his basket.

MR. HORNER
Class one contract, John.

John shakes his head, digesting. Horner gives a cruel smile.
MR. HORNER (CONT'D)
Don’t tell me you thought this
would all have a happy ending...?
John looks up. Intense. Remembering Jane’s words:

JOHN .
Happy endings...are Just stories...

VOICE (0.8.)
That haven’t finished yet.

And we see...JANE steps out from behind Mr. Horner. He turns,
a little surprised to see her. John’s eyes remain level,
giving away no emotion, nothing.

JORN
Perfect timing, Jane.

JANE
Perfect as always.

Mr. Horner keeps his eyes on Jane.

MR. HORNER
You here to collect early?

He motions to the bag. She takes it.

JANE
Yes. I am.

She opens the bag, checking the cash.

MR. HORNER
Any last words, John?

John keeps his eyes on Jane. A flicker of...connection...?

JOHN
In light of the seriousness of the
situation, and since I may not have
the chance later, I want you to
know I married you because I loved
you.

Jane looks at John.

JANE
Likewise. I wanted what I wanted
and I lied. I apologize.

Mr. Horner looks slightly confused. His smile creases.

JOHN
Me too. Also, you‘re the only girl
I ever loved. Nobody made me feel
the way you did, before all the
whatnet got in the way.

JANE
Ditto. Guy with the trolley?

Okay, now Mr. Horner is seriously confused. What the fuck is
going on? He looks back and forth between John and Jane.

Got him. Couple by the lamps?
JANE

Check.
JOHN

So. You ready?
And...Jane steps BESIDE JOHN, Facing Mr. Horner together.

JANE
Yeah. I’m ready.

Mr. Horner’s smile finally fades. Dead serious.

MR. HORNER
If this is some kind of plan, it
can't possibly work.

JOEN
No, it’s not a plan. See, we tried
to come up with a clever plan. But
we couldn’t agree on anything.

JANE
We had a few ideas, but they never
really gelled into anything.

There is something different about their bickering now. A
rhythm. As if they are in on the same joke. Their eyes keep
moving, casing. The customers slowly shift positions.

JOHN
{buying time)
I thought maybe we should ail meet
at the Wollman Memorial.

MR. HORNER
What are you talking about?

JANE
The ice rink in Central Park. From
all the movies.

JOHN
But turns out Jane can’t skate.

MR. HORNER
SHUT UP.

 

John and Jane look at Mr. Horner. He gathers himself.

They look

The Truth.

MR. HORNER (CONT'D)
Do you have any idea how many times
you're outnumbered here?

JOHN
Well see, we didn’t before. But we
do now.

MR. HORNER

So you know for a fact you‘re not
walking out of here alive.

JOEN
That‘s more than possible. Wouldn't

More than possible, I’d say

They look back.

JANE
Plus, we have very, very big balls.

Without turning.

JOHN
See you in the next life Jane.

JANE
Likewise John.

Jane pulls a gun and time turns to syrup. John throws the bag
into the air, covering Jane’s head. She FIRES at the BAG, 50
money explodes into the air, buying them precious cover.

A TELESCOPIC SIGHT SHOT is obecured by the cloud of bills.
Mr. Horner steps away, disappearing down the aisle.

A fully armed TEAM sit up in the KIDDIE FOAM BALL PIT where
they had been hiding. They OPEN FIRE on Jane and John.

Jane aims at a man drawing his gun and blows him backwards
off his feet. The MAN ON THE TOILET get off one shot at them
before John takes him out. John and Jane SMASH through the
paint cans, into the massive shelving unit.

They roll GRENADES across the floor spewing colored smoke.
Another grenade spins further out. As Killers swarm the area,
the grenade goes off with a flash, BANG! A percussion
grenade. It takes out the four nearest guys.

John and Jane, now inside the shelving unit, crouch-run
behind the paint cans as shots rain in, SPATTERING them with
multi-colored PAINTS. They roll out into the opposite aisle.

John skids across the floor on his back, FIRING continuously,
DROPPING two agents with rifles. Jane covers the other angle
FIRING at multiple targets pouring into her end of the aisle.

The aisles are working in their favor, they only have two
directions to cover. Back-to-back, they BLAST their way
through a chipboard wardrobe into another shelving unit where
they fluidly reload under cover as they spin into the next
aisle. Swapping directions, they cover opposite angles.

Agents pour into each end of the aisle but they have no
cover. Jane and John work through them methodically, spewing
hot lead, raining brass casings. More and more Agents appear.

But Jane and John have found an unstoppable RHYTHM. Like Fred
and Ginger.

(CONTINUED)
 

118.
CONTINUED: (5)

Covering each other, reloading under shelves, crossing into
aisle after aisle, covering each other again and again.

The Agents quickly realize they are at a disadvantage on this
terrain. They hang back, FIRING more carefully. John and Jane
have to be more careful now, more observant. Reacting to the
smallest movements. They burst out of the warehouse area and
into the SHOWROOM.

EFerily, John and Jane move through living room mock ups,
kitchens, stalking through studies and immaculate bedrooms.
Like a MAZE, they encounter Agents round corners, firing at
John and Jane from hidden vantage points.

Two Agents are dug into a BATHROOM, laying down fire. The
cover is more readily available here, the ground broken. John
and Jane’s progress is slowed in a mock-up of the ideal
suburban LIVING ROOM. They continue to shoot it out.

JANE (CONT'D)
Ammo?

JOHN
Low. Can’t get stuck here. We need
to reinforce.

Two Agents incoming. Jane gets low, grabbing CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS off a pillar, whipping out the lights, SWEEPING the
Agents to their feet. As they fall, she snatches their guns.
She tosses the reinforcements to John. On the move...

JANE
The other side of that wall,
through soft furnishings and we’re
home free.

John looks at his wife, fucking impressed. They jump up and
lay down a withering FIRE on the bathroom, which gets blown
to bits. One agent ICED, the other dives into the BATHTUB.

John and Jane run through the final few rooms and into SOFT
FURNISHINGS. It seems quiet. Too quiet. Suddenly a SHOT hits
John in the leg and he goes down. Jane drops with him.

They hit the deck and start CRAWLING through acres of beds in
rows. Jane pops up and takes out the shooter through a
venetian blind. She looks to John. “You okay?"

John nods and they're off, crawling under beds popping up now
and again to look around.

TWELVE AGENTS run into the section. They split up and stalk
through the beds.

(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED: (6)

Suddenly John pops up and takes one out. Just as they react,
Jane pops up on the other side twenty feet away and drops
another. They attempt to react to Jane, but John pops up,
twenty feet further on and HITS again. It’s impossible to
tell where John and Jane are. The remaining agents hit the
deck, adopting the Smiths' technique and...

A.game of deadly hide-and-seek ensues in the WORLD'S LARGEST
BEDROOM.

More Agents spill into the room. No one seems to be able to
locate where or when the Smiths will pop up next. John and
Jane separate. They shoot and fight their way toward the
door. Taking guns off fallen enemies for ammo. Their progress
seems inexorable. A bloodbath.

Then... Silence. Panting, they both listen. No sounds of
life. They are the only two people left in the world.

John and Jane slowly stand up and walk out. John leans on
Jane for support. As they pass Mr. Horner, without looking:

JANE (CONT'D)
We’re the only game left in town.

JOHN
You know where to find us.

EXT. IKEA ~ DAY

In slow motion: John and Jane, both streaked with blood and
colored paint, walk out of IKEA, weapons still drawn. They
pass SHOPPERS cowering behind cars. Kids cry. People pray.

A WOMAN runs out in front of them trying to get to her car.
John lazily raises his gun but Jane touches his arm. It’s OK.
She's real. He lowers it. A nuclear FAMILY are on their
faces behind their Range Rover.

John and Jane get in their car and slowly drive away. As they
head into the hills, we hear the swell of SIRENS. And...

A convoy of CARS speeds toward IKEA. We recognize the FBI
sedans. And...

INT. IKEA SUPERSTORE - DAY
CRUNCH! FBI AGENTS in flak-jackets swarm the store. Guns out.
Familiar faces. They see the FORTY KILLERS layed out. With

Christmas wreathes and blinking lights strewn everywhere, the
bodies almost lock like...Christmas presents.

John and Jane drive away. Jane at the wheel. she reaches
over, and puts her hand on John's hand. Blood mingling.

DR. WEXLER (V.0.)
So I’m pleased to see you back here

INT, DOCTOR WEXLER'S OFFICE - DAY
John and Jane sit next to each other on the love seat.

DR. WEXLER
I’m interested to hear what
progress you feel you’ve made, if
any, over the past two weeks or so.

JOBN
Well, I think we made a little
progress, don’t you honey?

JANE
I'd say so..

JOHN
I can’t speak for Jane but I feel
we've got to know each other all
over again, our good points, our
bad points...

JANE
Our really bad points..

JOHN
Right. I mean it’s early but I‘d
say we’ve brought a whole new level
of honesty to our relationship.

JANE
We realized we were depriving each
other of who we really were.

JOHN
I feel free for the first time
since we met. I feel like
there's...there’s...

more like us rather than shrinking
into some idea of who we should be.

DR. WEXLER.
You know, a lot of couples I meet,
the biggest block is trust.

JANE
You know that is so true.

DR. WEXLER.
It seems you’ve refound the trust
in your love. John, Jane, I'm
Pleased for you. What you’ve
discovered is very special. So ona
scale of one to ten how happy would
you say you are now?

They smile at Dr. Wexler.

JANE
Eight.

JOHK

They look each at each other. SNAP TO BLACK.
REALLY LOUD DEATH METAL.
