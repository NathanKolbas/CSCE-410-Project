INT, MARLOWE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A small room, dimly lighted by a street lamp outside.
Someone is pounding on the front door. Presently a
light goes on in adjoining bedroom. Rumpled from
sleep, pulling on a dressing gown over his pyjamas,
PHILIP MARLOWE enters.

MARLOWE
All right, all right...don't break
it in.

He crosses to the door, pausing to snap on a lamp.
We can see the room now; a tatty furnished rental
that probably hasn't changed much since the Fifties.
The only personal items there are are a hi-fi and
record collection, and a chess board with a problem
set up on it. Marlowe is a loner, and a lonely man.

VOICE OUTSIDE
(with more knocking)
Phil...it's me, Terry.

Marlowe opens the door, ‘TERRY LENNOX is on his door-
step; a handsome, personable, likable man who projects
complete sincerity. He is well-dressed and has with
him a fair-sized suitcase. Marlowe looks at hin,
yawning,

TERRY
It's a hell of an hour to be
pounding on your door...

MARLOWE
But...you've got a suitcase, and
a problem. Come on in, Terry.

Terry picks up the suitcase and comes in, shutting the
door behind him. Marlowe is busy lighting a cigarette.

MARLOWE
Who's on your tail...Marty Augustine?

TERRY
I know better than to tangle with
people like him. No...I'm afraid
the trouble is with my wife.

MARLOWE .
You and Sylvia splitting up again?

Looks like it. You want to hear

MARLOWE
No. Okay, Terry, what can I do
for you?

TERRY

I've got to get away for a while.
Maybe we'll both have some second
thoughts. Will you take me to
Tijuana?

{a beat)
I could drive myself, but that red
Maserati stands out like a search-
light, and I don't want her sending
people to track me down.

MARLOWE
Tijuana.

but willing to do it)
Fix yourself a drink. I'11 be with
you in a couple of minutes.

EXT, TIJUANA GATE - NIGHT
Marlowe's car, an undistinguished heap, not too old,
not too new, passes through the gate to the Mexican
side.
EXT. TIJUANA STREET ~ NIGHT
Marlowe's car pulls in to the curb. Terry gets out,
lifts the suitcase from the back seat, leans back in
to shake hands with Marlowe, and walks away along the
street, carrying the case.
EXT. TIJUANA STREET - NIGHT

Marlowe looks after Terry, shakes his head, then does
a U-turn and drives off.

SERGEANT GREEN leans on the window.

Your name Marlowe?

MARLOWE
Yeah.

Green flashes his ID.

GREEN
Let's go inside. We want to talk
to you,

He opens the car door, indicating that Marlowe shall
get out.

INT. MARLOWE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

We hear the key in the lock. The door opens. The
second cop steps in first, looks around; satisfied
the place is empty, he nods and Mariowe and Green
come in.

GREEN
Sit down, Marlowe.

Marlowe stands. The cops shrug and sit down.

GREEN
I'm Sergeant Green, this is Detective
Dayton. Where did you go last night?

Dayton has a notebook and pen. Marlowe lights a
cigarette. -

MARLOWE
This is where I say, What's all
this about? And you say, We ask

GREEN :
His address book, And there's a red
Maserati parked at the bottom of the
hill...registered to him.

MARLOWE
So?

GREEN
So where did you go last night?

MARLOWE
Let me see. I went down to a joint
on Franklin and had a hamburger and
a cup of coffee...the hamburger
wasn't very good. I came back here
and ran off Khatchaturyan's violin
concerto...I don't like it...and
played a game of chess against
Wilhelm Steinitz.

MARLOWE

Green rises to face Marlowe. Unobtrusively Dayton
circles around in back of Marlowe.

GREEN
Look, Marlowe. You've been gone
along time. I know, because I've
missed half a night's sleep waiting
for you to come back. Now you tell
me where you were.

‘ MARLOWE
I don't have to tell you anything,
Sergeant Green. Jf you have a

¢ specific charge against me, state
it. Otherwise, buggar off.

o~ GREEN

Dayton, do we have a specific
charge against Mr. Marlowe?

Dayton shoves Marléwe from behind, hard, into Green,
who staggers back and falls to his hands and knees.

FARMER
Always tripping over something.

MARLOWE

Yeah.

Farmer takes him firmly by the arm and sits him down.

FARMER
Just sit down and stay there, We
don't want you all banged up, some-
body might get the wrong impression.
Now tell me, Marlowe...why won't
you answer a simple question?

MARLOWE
Two reasons. First, it isn't simple.
Second, I don't like the way you
ask it.

He has taken out a pack of cigarettes. He starts to
light one. Farmer snatches them away.

FARMER
You crazy, rotting your lungs out
with those things? Don't you know
what they do to you? Besides, they
stink up the place.

Knowing Marlowe is a heavy smoker, he's going to let
him suffer,

dead, And not very nice dead.

He snaps his fingers at the Number Two cop, who passes
him some b/w glossies out of a folder. The Lieutenant
gives these to Marlowe, who is revolted. He puts them
down.

I'm sorry because you're stupid.
You sat in the pokey taking lumps

There was an aunt, but she's dead.

So he's buried at Otatoclan. No
morgue facilities there...they shovel
‘em under real fast.

with a little blue bow on top. Shit!
Terry wasn't at the end of his rope.

Terry Lennox didn't fly, and he
didn't hire the jeep. So how did
he get here?

 

JEFE
This is a mystery, Mr. Marlowe.
We don't know how he came,

Somebody must have brought him.

It would seem so.

But nobody saw who it was.

And nobody saw anyone come into
the hotel, or go to Terry's room.

Lennox' effects?

You're sure Lennox didn't contact

tives we see are proper gentlemen, neatly dressed,
emphasizing Marlowe's shabbiness. From o.s. we hear
the subdued clatter of business machines. Marlowe
walks along the corridor, opens a door.

sweeps the debris into the wastepaperbasket. As an
afterthought, he checks the automatic message-recorder.

RECORDED VOICE
This is the Southside Finance Company

He cuts off the message and goes out.
EXT. SUNNYSIDE SPA - DAY

Marlowe's car driving in past an identifying sign. The
spa looks more like a motel than a hospital; low build-
ings, trees, grass, a pool, Marlowe stops in front of
what seems to be the main office and gets out. There
are people about in the grounds, sunning beside the
pool, strolling, sitting in deck chairs. Instead of
going into the office, Marlowe starts walking.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE SPA - DAY

Marlowe prowling around the grounds, looking at people...
leoking for Roger Wade, He doesn't see anything resen-
bling Roger, but a well-endowed young lady in a brief
bikini catches his eye. He stares; she lifts her sun-
glasses and glares; and a voice speaks behind Marlowe.

Looking for someone?

quiet-spoken, with a gentle manner.

Politely but firmly he indicates that Marlowe shall

baffled.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE SPA = NIGHT

The patients' quarters are dark. Marlowe moves
silently through the grounds...and sees one lighted
room. He goes toward it.

EXT. SUNNYSIDE SPA - NIGHT

The light is coming from a glass wall, partly covered
by a floor-length drape but open at one side where the
sliding door is pushed back to admit air. Marlowe
makes his way quietly onto the terrace outside the

and hear what goes on in the room beyond.

A pleasant room, furnished with a bed, dresser, chair.
Dr. Verringer is talking with ROGER WADE, who sits on

small soft-spoken doctor. This may be because he is
under some sedation.

down?

He is looking at the prominent mark left on Marlowe's
forehead by the pistol-whipping...which Marlowe has
made no effort to conceal.

MARLOWE
Had a little run-in with Marty
Augustine last night. I think
I gave him a wrong answer.

Marlowe has passed out on the couch. He is sleeping
peacefully, but there is the hell and all of a party
going on in the house. The sounds of revelry pene~

wakefulness, He sits up, still pretty fuzzy and not
quite sure where he is. It begins to come back to him.
...Roger's study, a lot of booze...

He goes into Roger's bathroom. We hear water. running.
He comes out again, looking more awake, hair combed
and tie straightened. He remembers something and goes
to Roger's desk. There are no pages of typescript
beside the typewriter, but desk and floor are littered
with crumpled balls of yellow paper. Marlowe shakes
his head and wanders out.

Roger is enthroned, holding forth to a bunch of his

No, we knew he was going to blow

to interrupt his train of thought.
Besides, we were busy having an
affair. For Christ's sake! What
do you want? Mrs. Wade was trying
to wipe the blood off her face...
se was in there taking aspirin
when we heard the shot. Roger
was a psycho. He talked to me
about death...suicide...this
afternoon. Beautiful, he said.
Sweet, silken, swift. He seemed
fascinated by the recent suicide
of a man he knew.

DETECTIVE
Oh? Who was that?

MARLOWE
Terry Lennox. Maybe that tipped
Roger over the edge. Maybe it
was something else. But he was
ready and waiting to be tipped.

DETECTIVE
And there was no more definite
motive you can think of, Mrs.
Wade, that he might have had for
killing himself? Marital problems,
perhaps?

EILEEN
It must be quite obvious that our
marriage was not flourishing. But
that was nothing new, either.

We'd like you to come down to

MARLOWE
Terry Lennox was my friend. If

break it off. Roger went to see
her that day, and I knew it. He
didn't come back. When I heard
that she'd been beaten to death
I knew it had to be Roger, But...
he was my husband, I felt I had to
protect him. And then there was

there are SOUNDS from outside, o.8....a car halting,
feet thumping up the steps, a banging on the door.

him while Marty stands by watching. They are giving
Marlowe one hell of a beating, in spite of his protests,

All at once a door opens and a man comes in. He
speaks apart to Augustine, who speaks to his Number
One, who signals to the other hoods. They drop
Marlowe, literally, and walk out of the room.

Marlowe flops around feebly like a gaffed fish, trying
to get himself together.

Marty and some of the others come back into the room.
Marlowe braces himself for a continuation of the
beating, but they pay no attention to him. They're
not even looking his way. Marty and Number One are
talking together in low voices. They pass by Marlowe
heading for a door at the other end of the room.
Marlowe watches them.

A pleasant, cool, whitewashed room with the blaze of
sun outside, perhaps a garden in a central court. A
man sits with his back to us, the picture of sybaritic
comfort, smoking a cheroot, sipping a tall cold drink.
The SOUND of an iron door knocker echoes through the
place; it has a rather ominous sound, like the booming
of a passing bell. The man rises and turns; we see
that it is Terry Lennox, not disguised but somewhat
changed...heavily tanned, a moustache, an altered hair-
style. We follow him to the door.

doorway, hot, dusty, rumpled, tired.
