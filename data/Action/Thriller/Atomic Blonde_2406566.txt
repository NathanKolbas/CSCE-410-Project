FADE UP FROM BLACKNESS:

SUPER: “BERLIN, NOVEMBER 9, 1989”

INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is lit by a single bare bulb and a small television.
A man with “Eric Clapton” hair and moustache circa 1976 sits
alone, drinking two fingers of single-malt scotch.

This is DAVID PERCEVAL.
INSERT - NEWS FOOTAGE

MTV's Kurt Loder reports from the Berlin Wall. We see from
the MTV news footage that massive crowds are assembling. Two
EAST GERMAN SOLDIERS stand on the Wall, holding an MTV
umbrella, an iconic symbol of the times.

BACK TO SCENE

We MOVE ON a reflection of Perceval on the television.
Perceval leans in, shuts off the television and stands with a
clear objective. Time to go.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - NIGHT

The air is electric as West Germans carry hammers, chisels
and pickaxes with purpose towards the Berlin wall.

We see Perceval turn the corner into a dark alleyway near a
parked Saab 900 Turbo. Perceval sees a figure in the shadows
and slows.

PERCEVAL
Well, I suppose that’s it. We’ll be
obsolete by morning. I’1l be back
in London, and you... back to the
party.

We hear the faint sounds of HAMMERS STRIKING against
concrete.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

The simplicity of our struggle
crumbles as that wall comes down.
The lines on the map drawn by men
who never faced the risk themselves
will be harder to see.

In the distance, the CROWDS’ CHEERS are heard.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

A different world is approaching.
More volatile. More corrupt. There
will be no ideologies to protect
us. Just the brutal and cold
conscience of commerce.

Perceval’s eyes follow a group of West Germans with hand
tools moving towards the Wall.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Extortion... Whoever has the list
in this new world has all power.
Without it? Just a target.

Perceval turns back to the wordless figure in the shadows.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
We played our hands. Hell, I’m just
glad to see your face at this
moment, as the ramparts of tyranny
fall into the history books.

Perceval smiles softly to himself as he looks towards the
crowds.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Listen to them.

In the faint light, we see the flash of gunmetal.
We hear a GUNSHOT BARK out!

HARDCUT TO:

INT. LONDON - HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM/ROOM - DAY
SUPER: “LONDON, NOVEMBER 11, 1989 - TWO DAYS LATER”

A bathtub filled with ice cubes and freezing water. A woman
appears from beneath the surface.

This is LORRAINE BROUGHTON.

Broughton’s body is athletic and strong but also patchwork of
bruises and cuts from the last ten days. She pulls a towel
across her body, steps from the cold water and pours two
fingers of Stoli into glass. Broughton looks down at the
words “Hotel Moskva” on the label and then to the mirror.

She CLICKS on the dial of shitty RADIO. We hear David Bowie’s
“Cat People Putting out Fire.”
Broughton opens a vanity drawer. Next to the cosmetics is a
framed photo of her and a handsome man in front of the Blue
Mosque in Istanbul. Broughton stares down at the photo for
moment, held by a memory and then reaches for a compact.

Broughton covers her contusions with makeup and dresses in a
Navy crepe wool skirt suit from Chanel, heels and Jackie-O
sunglasses. Simple and sexy.

As she opens a Kelly bag we see a Browning Hi-Power at rest
next to a pack of Woodbine cigarettes. Broughton doesn’t need
to chamber check the weapon. It’s always loaded, cocked,
locked and awaiting her command.

She pulls a cigarette from the pack, steps out of the
bathroom, glances at the her empty bed and lights her
Woodbine. Broughton walks out her apartment door.

Bowie’s voice builds as we follow her out.

EXT. LONDON - DAY

The morning is crisp. A double-decker bus drives past with
“Boycott Apartheid” painted on its side.

EXT. CENTURY HOUSE - DAY

Just across the Westminster Bridge sits a limestone and glass
post-modern fortress. This is the British headquarters of
MI6. Broughton walks through the busy streets and into the
Century House.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - LOBBY - DAY

Broughton moves through the lobby and towards a line of
people waiting at the metal detectors. The SECURITY PERSONNEL
wave her straight through. She belongs here; she’s a bad ass.
Security walks her to a single elevator, inserts a key, and
Broughton enters the elevator alone. The doors close.

ELEVATOR

There is only one button, and that is an arrow down.
Broughton pushes the button and rides the elevator for some
time.

HALLWAY

As the doors open, she is meet by another two armed security
personnel who nod and wave her past them.
Broughton walks down a long, top lit, Kubrickian 60s hallway.
We see a remote video camera track her. No one else is down
here, and the two security personnel are 100 yards away by
now.

Broughton stops at an unmarked door. We see another video
camera lens focus on her, and the electronic DEAD BOLT CLICKS
the door open.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY

The “BIN” is a sterile ISO-FAC (Isolation Facility) for the
debriefing of operatives returning to England. The room is
sparse. All the walls are covered in 60s acoustic sound tiles
save for a two-way mirror on one wall.

MR. ERIC GRAY, mid-sixties and capable, sits with EMMETT
KURZFELD of the CIA at wooden table. Broughton enters and
slows as she sees Kurzfeld.

GRAY
How was your flight?

BROUGHTON
Uncomfortable.

Broughton takes a seat across from the two men.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Sir, what is he doing here?

GRAY
We thought it would be helpful to
get Kurzfeld’s perspective.
Gray leans back and sits next to Kurzfeld.

OTHER SIDE OF THE TWO-WAY MIRROR

We see a older man, “C,” watching. His face is reflected in
the glass of the two-way mirror.

GRAY (V.O.)
Given the scale of recent world
events, C will not be joining us.

Broughton looks straight into the two-way mirror and nods
with the confidence that C is there.

BROUGHTON (V.O.)
Yes, of course.

BACK TO ISO-FAC
Broughton looks at Gray and Kurzfeld.

GRAY
Let’s begin, for the record.

Gray reaches across to a Nagra III reel-to-reel recording
unit that rests on the desk. Gray CLICKS the recording DIAL.

GRAY (CONT'D)
Under formal direction of the Joint
Intelligence Committee: The
following will serve as first
contact and operational archive for
Her Majesty’s Military Intelligence
Section 6. Recorded on the 11th of
November 1989. The voices of record
are as follows, Senior Directorate
Officer Eric Gray, Senior Case
Officer Emmett Kurzfeld of the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency, and
returning British Operational
Officer Lorraine Broughton.

Gray leans forward and begins the interview.
GRAY (CONT’D)
Tell us about Berlin. Were you
there when Perceval was shot?

Broughton calmly replies to Gray.

BROUGHTON
No.

Broughton looks to the two-way mirror and then to Kurzfeld.
Gray scribbles down a note in a folder stamped “Top Secret”
in front of him and looks up at Broughton.
GRAY
Let’s start from the beginning,
shall we?

A GRAFFITI TITLE CARD SCRAWLS OUT: “THE COLDEST CITY”

EXT. LONDON - DAY
SUPER: “LONDON, NOVEMBER 2, 1989 - NINE DAYS AGO”

Hard rain. Broughton walks up the wide stairs of Century
House. A handmade Fox umbrella shelters her from the weather.
INT. CENTURY HOUSE - GRAY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is classic British Empire. Framed conquest maps
hang on the walls. A Regent desk in dark wood and oxblood
leather chairs. Gray and another man, the Chief of the Secret
Intelligence Service known only as "“C,” sit across from one
another.

GRAY
Broughton speaks four languages,
and her Russian is excellent.

Cc
What about her field craft and
perishable skills?

GRAY
She's an expert in Escape and
Evasion, NATO and Warsaw Pact
Weapons systems, and hand-to-hand
combat.

Cc
Knowing the reds as I do, she'll
need to use every damn one of them.

There is a KNOCK on the office DOOR. Neither Gray or C stand
as Broughton enters the room.

GRAY
Sorry to pull you in on short
notice, Lorraine. You know C, of
course.

Broughton looks to the emotionless man who remains seated in
a straight-back chair.

BROUGHTON
Yes, of course.

C motions towards a chair, and Broughton sits at the table
and opens a pack of Woodbine cigarettes.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Mind if I smoke, sir?

Gray pulls a cadet lighter from his pocket, leans across his
desk and lights Broughton’s Woodbine. Broughton takes a drag
off of her cigarette and exhales.

GRAY
I‘ll get straight to the point.
How well do you know, James
Gascione?
BROUGHTON
Enough to say hello... We did work
together several years back in
Istanbul.

Gray and C share a quick look, trying to decipher if she is
lying to them.

GRAY (PRE-LAP)
As of yesterday morning Gascione
was reported as incommunicado.

HARD CUT TO:

EXT. WEST BERLIN - DAWN
SUPER: “WEST BERLIN, NOVEMBER 1, 1989”

5 AM. Snow is falling. Most Berliners in the French, British
and American sectors of this divided city are asleep. A
dependable-looking middle-aged man runs down the empty
street.(The same man from the photo in Broughton’s vanity)

This is JAMES GASCIONE.

BROUGHTON (V.O.)
Who was Gascione handling?

Gascione’s shoes pound the pavement. His lungs burn. Each
quick exhale leaves a ghostly trail behind him. Remember the
gradation of fear in Gascione’s eyes as he glances over his
shoulder.

GRAY (V.O.)
Gascione was running an agent
codenamed Spyglass, a Stasi
officer.

Two ROUGH MEN chase after him through the snow. They are all
business. They are KGB.

Gascione cuts through a backyard, hurdles several fences,
vaults over a brick wall and lands. He checks over his
shoulder again. Nothing. Maybe he lost them.

GRAY (V.O.)
Spyglass had just delivered a list
to Gascione.

Gascione sprints towards the river and glances again just
as...
... the ROAR of an ENGINE gets his attention. Gascione holds
his hands out on instinct, headlights blinding him until he
feels the front of a sedan SLAM into his legs just above the
knees.

Gascione’s body is lifted and then violently pinned against a
parked car. Pain surges through his body as he looks down at
his mangled legs. The sedan reverses a few feet, and Gascione
crumples facedown onto the snowy pavement.

The two rough men slowly jog up to the scene as an average-
looking man, YURI BAKHTIN emerges from the car and moves
towards Gascione.

BAKHTIN
Look at me.

Gascione’s eyes tilt upward at Bakhtin.

GASCIONE
You... cossack... bastard!

Bakhtin presses the barrel of a Makarov pistol onto
Gascione’s forehead. The MAKAROV BARKS OUT, and Gasicone is
consumed by the white halo of a muzzle flash.

Silence.

Bakhtin grabs Gascione’s wrist and removes a classic “” Carl F
Bucherer ” wrist watch. Bakhtin nods towards the two rough
men, who lift Gasicone’s lifeless body from the blood-soaked
snow and dump it into the river Spree.

C (PRE-LAP)
Gascione is dead.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - GRAY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Broughton lowers her cigarette without a word.

GRAY
The Jerries fished him out of the
Spree River this morning. A West
German coroner extracted a 9x18mm
from the base of his skull.

BROUGHTON
Soviets.

Gray sets down a black-and-white photo of an average-looking
MAN in a Soviet military uniform.
GRAY
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin,
a lead KGB officer who was ticketed
out of Berlin on Aeroflot to
Moscow.

BROUGHTON
You want me in Moscow?

Cc
Bakhtin never arrived in Moscow.

Gray picks up the photo and scans the documents within a TS
(Top Secret) folder stamped “UK eyes only.”

GRAY
So either our man on the ground is
wrong, or Bakhtin pulled a switch
and is now lost to us.

Broughton takes another drag from her cigarette.

BROUGHTON
Gascione was en route to where?

GRAY
Our Head of Berlin operations when
he was assassinated.

BROUGHTON
How sensitive is the list?

GRAY
Spyglass claimed it was a complete
inventory of the identities and
locations of every active
clandestine officer.

Broughton lowers her cigarette as a thin ribbon of smoke
curls up towards the low ceiling.

BROUGHTON
Is that even possible?

Cc
The real question must be: is it
wise to hope it’s not possible
instead of proving it is?

There is a moment of silence in the room. A challenge has
just been laid down.
10.

GRAY
Everyone is hunting for it: the
Yanks, the Frogs, us, and the
Soviets for sure.

Cc
Tell her the rest of the good news.

GRAY
Spyglass disclosed the list would
expose a double agent by the name
of “Satchel” within the allied
intelligence network.

Cc
You find Satchel in this
embarrassing mess and we'll hang
him for treason.

Broughton exhales smoke from her lungs and hardens to the
truth of this knowledge.

Cc (CONT'D)
The list is the whole damn
chessboard. Whoever controls it
controls the Cold War.

GRAY

Berlin is already on a short fuse.
Hungary has dismantled hundreds of
kilometers of the Iron Curtain
since May. Last month, East Germans
stormed the FRG’s embassies in
Prague and Warsaw. They were given
immunity and sent to West Germany.

Cc
Gorbachev’s glasnost nonsense has
his people hopeful, and there is
nothing worse than a hopeful enemy.

GRAY
The Wall won’t last much longer.
David thinks it might even fall
before Christmas.

BROUGHTON
David, sir?

GRAY
David Perceval is our number one in
Berlin. We are sending you to link
up with him.
11.

BROUGHTON
I’ve never been to Berlin, and if
Bakhtin has the list, he’s on the
run.

Gray sits behind the Regent desk.

GRAY
We don’t think he does. There’s no
question he would have taken it
straight to Moscow.

Cc
The list is still in Berlin.

GRAY
Perceval is searching for it, but
we want another pair of hands at
the tiller as it were.

C leans ever so slightly forward in his chair to commit
importance to his words.

C (PRE-LAP)
Most of the allied officers have
been in Berlin for years.

HARDCUT:

INT./EXT. EAST BERLIN UNDERGROUND CLUB - NIGHT
SUPER: “EAST BERLIN, NOVEMBER 2, 1989”
Perceval slams a empty shot glass of whiskey down on the bar.

We hear Public Enemy’s Chuck D coming through the SPEAKERS
with “Fight the Power.” Drunk East German youth fill the
place. It’s a strange mix of punk, hip hop, and anti-East
German establishment.

Perceval takes some D-marks from a KID for a bottle of Jack
Daniels and a old Penthouse magazine. Another East German
hands him money, and Perceval hands over a pair of Levi's.
Perceval has a nice little side business in selling
contraband.

Cc (V.0.)
With no embassy to watch over them,
they play by their only rules.

Perceval sees a clean-cut East German enter and sit at a
quiet table near the bar.
12.

This is SPYGLASS.

He is the real reason Perceval is in the East. Perceval moves
across the room and joins him at the table. Perceval hands a
small brown bag of contraband (canned food, Jack Daniels and
women’s jeans) to Spyglass.

PERCEVAL
The Jordache jeans were not easy.

SPYGLASS
They are for my wife’s birthday.

PERCEVAL
Let me cut right to the bone. Where
is the goddamn list?

SPYGLASS
Is this a joke?

PERCEVAL
No joke.

SPYGLASS

I gave it to Gascione last night.

PERCEVAL
Gascione never showed.

Spyglass looks up at Perceval with consternation settling in
his brown eyes.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Why do you think I jumped the Wall,
and I made contact with you?

SPYGLASS
I don’t know. I followed all the
orders. Look, I was careful. I met
Gascione in Friedrichshain. He took
the list from me.

Spyglass’'s eyes are filling with despair.
SPYGLASS (CONT'D)
I did my part. I have risked
everything.... You must to get me
and my family across!

PERCEVAL
Calm down.

Perceval studies Spyglass for a moment.
13.

SPYGLASS
Are you going to kill me?
PERCEVAL
I’ve thought about it... However, I

can’t ignore the fact you are
telling me the truth.

Spyglass takes a breath as he controls his anxiety.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Did you make a copy of the list?

SPYGLASS
No... I memorized it.

PERCEVAL
The entire list?

Spyglass nods. Suddenly, the front door of the club is kicked
in. We see the green-gray uniforms of the EAST GERMAN STASI
OFFICERS surge into the crowd.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Goddamn it.

Perceval scans the room. An EAST GERMAN BARTENDER quickly
motions to him.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Move!

Perceval and Spyglass avoid the chaos of the room. The
bartender pulls back a small service door to reveal a
hallway.

The bartender, Perceval, Spyglass, and several patrons run
down the hallway to the door leading outside. Perceval opens
the door to see two STASI OFFICERS standing directly in front
of him.

STASI
(in German)
You? Your papers! Now!

Spyglass and the others are in the hallway, unseen to the
Stasi. Perceval reaches into his pocket and pulls out a worn
leather wallet. He steps towards the Stasi and in the same
motion, throws the wallet into one officer’s face as a
distraction. Perceval punches one Stasi in the throat and
knees the other in the family jewels. Both drop to the alley
and writhe in pain.
14.

Perceval looks back through the door, still open a few inches
as Spyglass and the others are witness to his burst of
violence.

PERCEVAL
I'll be in contact.

Perceval steps past the two Stasi on the ground and slowly
jogs away down the alley and into the night.

C (PRE-LAP)
It seems Berlin has its way with
the younger generation. It’s
infectious, an epidemic really.
They’re all feral and have gone
native.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - GRAY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Broughton exhales her Woodbine and stares at Gray and C
through the smoke.

GRAY
You have no family, no colleagues,
no friends there.

Cc
No history to confuse your
loyalties. You don’t even know
Perceval.

C stands and slowly walks towards the threshold of the office
door. C pauses with his back to the room.

Cc (CONT'D)

When that bloody Wall comes
crashing down, we don’t want to be
under it. I want that list,
Broughton. Bring it back home, and
you'll find yourself at Buckingham
for tea.

C moves out the door, and Broughton looks back across the
desk at Gray.

GRAY
I recommended you for this. So, do
try and look grateful.

Gray hands Broughton the TS folder.
15.

GRAY (CONT’D)
I know, it’s short notice.

H/WAR suggested you use Gladys
Lloyd, as she was never
compromised. Commit everything to
memory and then burn it all.

Gray points to a large metal “burn can” for documents in the
corner of the room.

GRAY (CONT'D)
A car will take you to your flat.
Pack and then go straight to
Heathrow. Remember, Lorraine, trust
no one.

Gray walks toward the office door. Broughton flips open the
folder to a black-and-white photo of BER-1, David Perceval.

BROUGHTON
What’s he like, sir? David
Perceval.

FLASH CUT TO:

INT. EAST BERLIN - TUNNEL - NIGHT

Perceval carries a flashlight and takes a pull off a fifth of
JD. He walks briskly and makes his way through a covert
tunnel network towards West Berlin.

GRAY (V.O.)
David Perceval is a royal pain in
the ass.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - GRAY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Gray stops and turns at his office door.

GRAY
However, he is arguably one of the
best damn spies to ever serve the
Crown. My office is yours.

Gray steps out of the office, and Broughton opens the TS
folder in front of her.

PRE-LAP on soundtrack: “One Thing Leads to Another” by The
Fixx.
16.

INT./EXT. PAN AM BOEING 707 - DAY

Broughton is in a window seat. We see a couple empty mini
bottles of Stoli on the tray in front of her and hardcover
copy of Trevanian’s “Shibumi”. Broughton looks out the window
at the bleak November sky.

INT. WEST BERLIN - TEMPELHOF AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY

Broughton walks off the Pan Am flight and towards the
passport control kiosks. She hands the West German PASSPORT
OFFICER her UK passport. He looks at the passport photo and
then to Broughton. He flips through the pages with scrutiny,
gives her another look and then stamps her passport and waves
her through.

We follow Broughton into the uncluttered airport terminal. A
loose crowd waits for the arriving international travelers.
From this crowd, a GENTLEMAN steps forward, all business, and
extends his hand.

GENTLEMAN
Ms. Lloyd?

Broughton slows to a stop. The Gentleman’s British accent is
good, perhaps too good.

GENTLEMAN (CONT’D)
Mr. Perceval was running late. He
sent me to pick you up.

Broughton scans the terminal then looks back to the
Gentleman.

GENTLEMAN (CONT’D)
Checked bags?

BROUGHTON
No.

GENTLEMAN
Please, follow me.
EXT. WEST BERLIN - TEMPELHOF AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY

Broughton eyes her surroundings as they cross into a parking
lot.

We see an attractive WOMAN turn from a phone booth, watching
them, then methodically dial a number on the pay phone.
17.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - TEMPELHOF AIRPORT - PARKING LOT - DAY

A forest green BMW 2002 sedan is isolated at the end of the
parking lot. The Gentleman and Broughton climb in.

INT./EXT. BMW 2002 - CONTINUOUS

The Gentleman pulls out of the airport parking lot and onto
the main route. They drive in silence.

Broughton looks into her side mirror and notices a Saab 900
Turbo tailing them.

GENTLEMAN
Well... it’s a remarkable time to
be in Berlin.

BROUGHTON
That so?

Broughton looks again to her mirror and sees the Saab is
still there.

GENTLEMAN
The music, nightlife and great
restaurants.

BROUGHTON
You've got a suggestion?

GENTLEMAN
For the beautiful people, go to the
Palm for a drink.

Broughton looks back to the mirror. The Saab speeds up behind
them and taps the BMW 2002 in a perfect PIT maneuver.
Broughton quickly buckles her seat belt. The Gentleman is too
busy controlling the car to notice Broughton reach across and
depress the button to his seat belt. The BMW spins off the
road, and Broughton braces for impact.

The BMW slams into a metal guard rail. The WINDSHIELD
SHATTERS, and the Gentleman is ejected onto the hood.

Broughton relaxes and looks out at the bloody and moaning
body of her driver. A figure drags the Gentleman off the hood
and onto the frozen ground. We see Perceval look back through
the shattered glass at Broughton.

PERCEVAL
Welcome to Berlin.
18.

Perceval stuffs a rag in the Gentlemen’s mouth and secures
his mouth, ankles and hands with duct tape. Broughton
unbuckles her seat belt and steps out of the BMW.

BROUGHTON
I could have handled him.

PERCEVAL
I have no doubt. Question is: What
were you waiting for?

Perceval drags the Gentleman across to his idling Saab. The
boot is already open.

BROUGHTON
Who does he work for?

PERCEVAL
KGB.

Perceval dumps the Gentlemen into the boot. The Gentleman
starts to realize what is happening. Broughton unloads a huge
right hand into his face, more as a fuck you to Perceval than
anything. The Gentleman’s body goes limp. Perceval shoots her
a look, impressive.

BROUGHTON
I am on the ground five minutes and
get blown.

PERCEVAL
You’re not blown.

Perceval slams the boot closed.

BROUGHTON
He knew my name.

PERCEVAL
Troubling.

BROUGHTON
And yours.

PERCEVAL
Not surprised.

Broughton and Perceval move and get into the car.
19.

INT./EXT. PERCEVAL’S SAAB - CONTINUOUS

The inside of the car is littered with Wienerwald wrappers
and empty beer cans. Perceval jams the Saab into gear and
speeds away.

BROUGHTON
How would anyone know I was on that
flight?

Perceval turns with a peripheral smile.

PERCEVAL
Those are the kinds of questions
that keep us up late at night.

BROUGHTON
We should message the home office
and let them know what happened.

PERCEVAL
Christ and Mother Mary. London sent
you to sort this mess out?

BROUGHTON
I just go where I am told.

PERCEVAL
Story of our lives. Checkpoint
Charlie, by the way.

Perceval points out the windshield.

BROUGHTON

I’m not here to collect postcards.
PERCEVAL

Ahhh... You’re all business under

that lipstick.
Broughton ignores the remark.

BROUGHTON
I was told you'd be briefed.

PERCEVAL
Your cover is civil service? Gladys
Lloyd, Cambridge-educated lawyer
sent by James Gascione’s family to
return the body and effects of
their now-deceased son, a British
subject.
20.

Perceval looks for a reaction but gets nothing from
Broughton.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Just how in the hell the suits
think that’s going to help find our
damn list is beyond me. Picking up
Gascione’s body won’t take much
time.

BROUGHTON
I‘1l just have to be creative.

Perceval points outside the car again.

PERCEVAL
Brandenburg Gate. My office is just
there... I suppose HQ thinks

there’s no point in replacing
Gascione with the Wall coming down.

BROUGHTON
Seems improbable after twenty-eight
years.

PERCEVAL

Everything is probable. And that
assertion confirms to me you don’t
know the first damn thing about
this city, so don’t pretend you do.

The tension builds within the car. Perceval SLAMS on the
brakes and slides the car to stop. Perceval gets out of the
car, opens the trunk, pulls the KGB driver out and drags him
onto the sidewalk.

We see a sign the reads: “Embassy of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic.”

Perceval leans the KGB driver against the Soviet Embassy's
wrought-iron gates. Within the compound several SOVIET GUARDS
start to move towards the gates.

BROUGHTON
What are you doing?
PERCEVAL
Sending my old friend Bremovych a

message.

Perceval stomps his foot across the driver’s face for good
measure.

HARDCUT TO:
21.

INT. EAST BERLIN’S HOHENSCHONHAUSEN PRISON- NIGHT

We see a man built like a Soviet T-10 battle tank. He wears a
gray Soviet translation of a Brooks Brothers suit and is all
business as he moves into the room.

This is ALEKSANDER BREMOVYCH, KGB.

A dozen STASI OFFICERS have six EAST GERMAN PUNK ROCKERS and
B-BOYZ from the underground night club lined up in their
underwear against the wall. There is a wooden table in the
center of the room and nothing more. Bremovych sets a carton
of Russian “Belomorkanal” cigarettes on the table.

BREMOVYCH
(in German)
You’re not free to go. You may
never be free to go. Unless you
tell me what I want to hear?

Bremovych lights a filter-less Belomorkanal from a pack of
twenty five. Four Stasi officers drag a young man over and
SLAM him face down onto the table. Bremoyvch holds a small
B/W photo of Bakhtin.

BREMOVYCH (CONT’D)
(in German)
Have you seen this man?

EAST GERMAN
(in German)
No.

Bremoyvch nods and lays down another photo of Spyglass.

BREMOVYCH
(in German)
Last night at the club, did you see
this man?

EAST GERMAN
(in German)
No.

Bremoyvch takes a long drag on the filter-less cigarette and
then jams it into the young East German’s eye. The young man
howls in pain and buckles under his captor’s hands. Bremovych
lights another cigarette and holds up the carton for the rest
of young men to witness.

BREMOVYCH
(in German)
If I must, I will use all of them
to get the truth from you.
22.

Bremovych turns back to the whimpering young East German.

BACK TO:

INT. PERCEVAL’S SAAB —- CONTINUOUS

Perceval and Broughton are driving through the streets of
West Berlin.

We see outside, a massive wall of graffiti-covered concrete
that divides East and West.

Broughton

BROUGHTON
I didn’t travel as a QM, so I need
you to supply me with a firearm.

PERCEVAL
This is Berlin, not Tombstone.

BROUGHTON
Gascione was assassinated, and I
was just set up by the KGB.

PERCEVAL
If the KGB wants you dead, you’1l
need more than good looks and a
pistol.

looks out the side window.

BROUGHTON
Turn left here and take me to my
hotel.

PERCEVAL

They said you’d never been to
Berlin. How in the hell do you know
where your hotel is?

BROUGHTON
I can read a map, you chauvinistic
sonofabitch.

Perceval SLAMS on the brakes and pulls the car to a stop.

PERCEVAL
You may not be declared here by Her
Majesty, but I am still the head of
this goddamn station, and you'll
respect me.

INT. WEST

A Patrick

23.

BROUGHTON
Respect is a two-way street, Mr.
Perceval. Clearly, you don’t want
me here. However, C himself gave me
this job.

PERCEVAL
c is an arrogant lapdog and doesn’t
know fuck all about the world past
the edge of his desk!
opens the door and steps out.

BROUGHTON
Good night, Mr. Perceval.

crosses the hardscrabble street and walks towards
hotel, never looking back.
BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Nagel print hangs on the wall. The room is equal

parts Euro-chic and Miami Vice. We hear the RUNNING WATER
from the bathroom. Broughton sits on the edge of the bed
watching MTV news on a color Zenith.

KURT LODER (V.O.)
The civil disobedience in East
Berlin continues to build momentum.
The disenfranchised youth leaders
shout out their protests through
the tear gas and water cannons. One
eyewitness tells of police beating
the peaceful demonstrators with
batons.

Broughton turns off the sound on the Zenith. She moves the

hardcover

of “Shibumi” onto the nightstand, picks up the

rotary telephone, dials, and speaks.

BROUGHTON
Guten Abend. Ich bin Fraulen Lloyd,
auf der Britische Botschaft Khan,
Uh... Kann ich mit der Coroner
Sprechen?

MORGUE EMPLOYEE (V.O.)
You are English? Why do you require
the coroner?
24.

BROUGHTON
I’ve been sent to arrange the
return of a British subject,
recently dead... I’m told you have
the body.

MORGUE EMPLOYEE (V.O.)
Nobody works tomorrow. It’s Sunday.
Call Monday, in the morning. Auf
Wiedersehen.

Broughton hears a CLICK and sets the phone on its cradle.

Broughton walks into the bathroom and turns off the cold
water filling the chipped porcelain tub. She turns to a half-
dozen little ice buckets filled to the top and then dumps
them into the bathtub.

This is her daily ritual, the ice bath.

Broughton switches off the bathroom light. The ZENITH is
still PLAYING in the other room. She undresses in the faint
light and steps into the freezing water without pause.

Broughton sinks up to her nose with only her pale green eyes
on the icy surface... then disappears below.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - APARTMENT BUILDING - NEXT MORNING
SUPER: “NOVEMBER 3, 1989”

Broughton stands on the steps of a colorless apartment
building and RINGS a call box BUZZER. Across the street,
fifty feet away, is the graffiti-covered Berlin Wall snaking
through the neighborhood.

INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - DAY

Surveillance gear and monitors sit on a small table.
Contraband is everywhere: LPs, Jack Daniels, cartons of Lucky
Strikes and Marlboro Reds. We hear the BUZZER, and Perceval,
still in his clothes from last night, stirs and answers the
call box.

PERCEVAL
Yeah.

BROUGHTON (0.C.)
Mr. Perceval? It’s Ms. Lloyd. You
left a message at my hotel.
25.
PERCEVAL
I'll be right down.

Perceval grabs his coat and moves towards the front door.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Broughton waits and watches a couple of children kick a
soccer ball against the Wall. We see the same WOMAN from the
airport watching from a parked beige Mercedes 300D.

After a few moments, Perceval exits his building.

PERCEVAL
Let’s take a walk.

They start down the street, side by side.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
About yesterday... in the car...
the chauvinistic remarks. I
shouldn’t have --

Broughton, without slowing her stride, interrupts.

BROUGHTON
Apology accepted.

Perceval looks at Broughton and then clears the air between
them with a simple nod.

PERCEVAL
It’s as cold as a witch’s tit on
the dark side of the moon today.

BROUGHTON
I like the cold.
PERCEVAL
No wonder they kept sending you to

Moscow.
Broughton looks at Perceval.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Don’t act surprised. We both read
each other’s file.

Perceval stops at a street vendor selling currywurst from a
rolling cart. Perceval turns to Broughton.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Buy you breakfast?
26.

Broughton doesn’t need to say no for Perceval to understand.
He buys two, and they walk through a broadstone archway.

We see a sign that reads “TIERGARTEN PARK.”

They continue on the crushed gravel path until stopping next
to a frozen duck pond. Perceval throws small pieces of his
currywurst bun out onto the ice.

BROUGHTON
You shouldn’t feed them bread.
It's bad for their digestion.

A thin man wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a heavy winter
topcoat approaches.

It’s Emmett Kurzfeld.

KURZFELD
She is right.

PERCEVAL
You damned Americans will back up
anything in a skirt.

KURZFELD
You must be Ms. Lloyd. I am
Kurzfeld.

Broughton extends her hand.

BROUGHTON
Pleased to meet you.

Kurzfeld’s hand stays in the warmth of his pocket.

PERCEVAL
Kurzfeld here went to Princeton.

Broughton slowly retracts her hand.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Kurzfeld thinks he knows
everything... So you two should get
along just fine.

KURZFELD
I’ve been in Berlin almost as long
as David... Nobody wants the list
to fall into Soviet hands.

Broughton looks to Perceval.
27.

BROUGHTON
What else have you shared with him?

PERCEVAL
Just women and scotch.

KURZFELD
We watch out for one another.

Broughton looks back to Kurzfeld.

BROUGHTON
I think Bakhtin is going to dump
the list on the black market.

KURZFELD
What makes you so sure?

BROUGHTON
If one of the Allies has it, we'd
already know. If Moscow had it,
there’s nothing we can do. So
either Bakhtin puts it up for sale,
or we'll never see it again.

KURZFELD
She’s smart.

PERCEVAL
You only say that because you had
that same idea.
Kurzfeld turns to Perceval.

KURZFELD
What’s the plan with Spyglass?

PERCEVAL
I haven't decided yet.

KURZFELD
I should be going. Let me know if
the company can help in any way.
Kurzfeld nods towards Broughton.

KURZFELD (CONT'D)
Good day, Ms. Lloyd.

Kurzfeld walks on alone through the park covered in rags of
snow and frozen grass.

BROUGHTON
Is there even a plan?
28.

PERCEVAL
Not yet, and if there was, I'd be
damned if I'd share it with the
Yanks.

HARDCUT BACK TO:

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY

The NAGRA III keeps recording. The ashtray on the table is
filled with several crushed Woodbines. Gray and Kurzfeld look
across at Broughton.

GRAY
So, how would you describe the
situation on the ground those first
couple of days?

BROUGHTON
Hostile.

GRAY
With Perceval?

BROUGHTON
With everyone.

GRAY
Who was in the country?

Broughton pulls another Woodbine out of her pack.

BROUGHTON
You weren't.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - GLIENICKE BRIDGE - DAY

The sky is colorless. A lone figure walks through the cold
and across the “Bridge of Spies.” As the figure gets closer
we see it is Bremovych.

His KGB DRIVER is waits for him on the West German side.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
Did she get the message?

GENTLEMAN
(in Russian)
I believe so.
29.

Bremovych pauses for a moment and looks at the swollen face
and black eye of the driver.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
Did the woman do that to you?

GENTLEMAN
(in Russian)
No.

The Gentleman opens the side door of a black sedan.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
You’d look much worse if she
touched you.

Bremovych climbs in.

INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - DAY
Perceval and Broughton enter the room.

PERCEVAL
Can I take your coat?

Broughton hands over her coat. She moves down a short hallway
as Perceval hangs her coat on a hook by the front door.

Less chaos than the rest of Perceval’s apartment. A plain
desk and two worn-leather club chairs. A bookshelf running
the length of the room. A small TELEVISION PLAYS MTV Europe
in the background.

BROUGHTON
So this is what you get after years
of service.

PERCEVAL
In a complicated world, I prefer
things to be simple.

Broughton scans the shelves filled with volumes in six
foreign languages, save for the “Great Books” that are all in
English.

BROUGHTON
You like to read.
PERCEVAL
Depends on the book... If I said

Epictetus, I would be lying...
(MORE )
30.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Volume 23... Chapter 15... “He who
neglects what is done for what
ought to be done, sooner effects
his ruin than his preservation.”

Broughton’s eyes settle onto Volume 23.

BROUGHTON
Machiavelli.

PERCEVAL
The prince of princes.

Broughton turns back to Perceval.
BROUGHTON
“It’s a double pleasure to deceive
the deceiver.”
A hint of a smile from Perceval.
PERCEVAL
Ahhh. Niccolé sounds sweeter
somehow, coming from you.

Perceval is at his desk and reaches for an eighteen-year-old
bottle of single malt from the Isle of Skye.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Drink?

BROUGHTON
No.

We hear the German version of “Major Tom” by Véllig Losgelést
PLAYING on the TELEVISION.

Broughton picks up a “Penthouse” magazine from a stack on
table.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Your library includes Larry Flint.

PERCEVAL
The champion of free speech.

Broughton sets the magazine back down as Perceval pours two
fingers of Talisker into a heavy glass.

BROUGHTON
I am sorry about Gascione.

Perceval raises the glass in silent tribute.
31.

PERCEVAL
James was a gentlemen, one hell of
a spy and a true friend. I know you
were close. James told me as much.

Broughton remains steady and without emotion. Perceval slowly
sips the scotch.

BROUGHTON
I’ll need his address.

PERCEVAL
I’ve been there. The West Germans
have been there. God only knows who
else.

BROUGHTON
I haven't.

PERCEVAL
You always get your way?

The slightest smile appears at the corner of Broughton’s
mouth, then disappears.

BROUGHTON
We'll let that question keep you up
tonight.

Perceval nods and lifts his glass of scotch.

PERCEVAL
It’s down the street from
Fehrbelliner platz.
Brandenburgisher Strasse 10. It’s a
walk-up. Fifth floor.

BROUGHTON
Gascione’s passport?

PERCEVAL
The police have his passport. He
was carrying it.

BROUGHTON
Don’t you have a copy?
PERCEVAL
No... but don’t worry your pretty

little head. The Circus called me
yesterday with the number.

BROUGHTON
Can you write it out for me?
32.

PERCEVAL
Already have.

Perceval glances at his desk and hands her a piece of paper
with Gascione’s passport number.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Anything else?

BROUGHTON
Where would you recommend for
dinner and a drink?

PERCEVAL
Is that an invitation?

Broughton gives him a silent look, and that’s all Perceval
needs to have his question answered. Perceval moves back to
the front door and hands Broughton her coat from the hook.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Well then, you can’t go wrong with
the Ritz off Potsdamer. The venison
is marvelous.

Broughton turns for the attaché office door.

BROUGHTON
Thank you, Mr. Perceval.

PERCEVAL
You’re welcome, and feel free to
drop in anytime, Ms. Lloyd.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Broughton pops open the back on the hardcover novel of
“Shibumi” to reveal a lead lined compartment.

Inside: a Narga SN mirco recording unit and thin surveillance
microphone.

With care Broughton tapes the wire to her lean body and then
conceals the Narga SN recorder. Broughton checks herself in
the mirror. Perfect. Behind her, the bathtub of ice cubes
drains. Broughton steps into the room and glances at the
Zenith.

We see news of the German protests growing in size around
both sides of the Berlin Wall.

Broughton grabs her dark coat and is out the door.
33.

EXT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

Along a quiet street, just around the corner from Zoo
Station, is a tiny watch repair shop. Broughton enters with
purpose.

INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Broughton moves through orderly store filled with hundreds of
grandfather clocks. A couple of patrons mill about the
aisles. In the back of the shop, a middle-aged man known only
as the WATCHMAKER stares through magnified jeweler’s glasses
at the guts of a “Newman” Daytona.

BROUGHTON
I'd like to purchase a watch.

The Watchmaker never looks up from his delicate work. With a
thick German accent:

WATCHMAKER
I don’t sell watches. I only fix
them.

BROUGHTON
I am looking for an East German
watch.

WATCHMAKER

The East German watches aren’t
worth wearing.

BROUGHTON
I am looking for a Ruhla.

WATCHMAKER
A Ruhla is very different.

BROUGHTON
I will pay a premium.

WATCHMAKER
I sense you’re serious. Come back
tomorrow before closing.

BROUGHTON
Thank you.

Broughton exits the shop without another word, and the
Watchmaker never looks up from the precision of his work.
34.

EXT. BRANDENBURGER STRASSE 10 - NIGHT

A working-class neighborhood. Broughton approaches the
apartment building and deftly breaches her way inside.

INT. GASCIONE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Broughton climbs up a dimly-light stairwell to the fifth
floor landing. She quickly shims the lock and steps into
apartment 5A without a sound.

INT./EXT. APARTMENT 5A - CONTINUOUS

Broughton moves through Gascione’s apartment and studies the
details of a dead man.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she moves to the bedroom,
examining.

A closet of perfectly-folded clothes and shoes in neat rows.
The bed’s made with military corners. A porthole into
Gascione’s precise and orderly life.

Broughton steps into the living room. She walks towards a
Biedermeier Secretaire desk and picks up a framed photo.

We see a young James Gascione and David Perceval in the
English countryside, Holland & Holland shotguns cradled over
their shoulders and freshly-killed rabbits in both of their
strong hands.

Broughton sets the photo down and takes in the room.

Outside the window, Broughton notices the building across the
street bathed in blue flashing lights. She leans towards the
window for a better view.

We see German polizei cars roll to a stop. A dozen OFFICERS
advance towards the apartment building.

INT. APARTMENT 5A/APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Broughton moves through the hallway as she hears the polizei
five floors below.

Broughton pushes a sofa out of the living room and down the
short hallway. She pushes the sofa out into the stairwell
landing.

We hear POLIZEI BOOTS four floors below.
35.

Broughton moves back to the kitchen and finds what she needs:
a box of steel wool and bottle of high-proof rubbing alcohol.
Broughton moves back down the hallway.

We hear POLIZEI BOOTS three floors below.

Broughton piles the steel wool on the sofa, soaks the sofa
and steel wool in rubbing alcohol and stands back.

Broughton draws a black ski mask from her jacket pocket and
pulls it over her head.

We hear POLIZEI BOOTS two floors below.

Broughton lights a match against the wall and tosses it onto
the soaked steel wool and sofa.

WHOOOOM!

Broughton pushes the burning sofa down the stairs at the
advancing polizei and forces them to dive out of the way. The
polizei push past flames and climb the stairs. Still wearing
the ski mask, Broughton ducks back in the apartment and waits
in the darkness.

The first officer charges in with his baton in hand.
Broughton slams the door and bolts it shut. As the officer
turns, Broughton strikes him with blinding speed and then
hanging arm throws him to the floor.

The officers outside in the hallway are POUNDING on the DOOR.
Broughton picks the baton and then cracks it down on the
officer. He is out cold.

We hear the CHAMBERING of a breaching ROUND into a shotgun,
and Broughton rolls out of the way as the LOCK on the front
door EXPLODES inwards.

Broughton bolts through the living room as a second officer
grabs her from behind. Broughton snaps her head back,
crushing his nose, and then hip throws her attacker through
the glass doors of the balcony.

EXT. GASCIONE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Broughton steps over the broken glass and the officer. She
quickly climbs out onto the thin features of the building.
It’s not gymnastic pretty but sixty feet off the street,
Broughton is strong and without fear.

Broughton, now on the rooftop, quickly scans the buildings
around her as she sprints across the flat roof.
36.

Three polizei officers pull themselves onto the rooftop, and
the chase is on. Broughton jumps down a staggered rooftop,
lands and sprints with the polizei closing in.

EXT. VARIOUS ROOFTOPS — CONTINUOUS

Without slowly down, Broughton jumps across onto the next
rooftop and lands safely. The polizei follow her with less
elegance.

Broughton leaps across an open gap between the last two
apartment buildings, lands on a ledge and then jumps into the
void below.

The three polizei run to the edge of the rooftop, only to see
the human wearing a ski mask and dark winter jacket land on
the thick nylon roof of a farmer’s market tent.

Broughton slides down the tent roof, lands on her feet, and
never looks back. The three polizei can do nothing but watch
as the figure disappears into the evening crowds.

PRE-LAP on the soundtrack: “Der Kommissar” by After the Fire.

EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT

Broughton steps from a taxi and walks towards the doors of
the Palm Restaurant.

INT. PALM RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Soundtrack shifts to a piano player behind a Bosendorfer
singing a slow and sexy club version of “Der Kommissar.”

Broughton walks up to an empty space at the Art Deco bar.

BROUGHTON
Stoli on ice.

The BARTENDER nods. Broughton puts a cigarette to her lips
and turns slowly to the room.

A PATRON holds out a Riga metal lighter with its flame
burning. Without a word, Broughton leans into the fire,
lights her smoke, and only when she pulls away do...
We see the Soviet KGB agent, Bremovych.

BREMOVYCH
Haben sie, fraulein?
37.

BROUGHTON
I don’t speak German.

BREMOVYCH
You are British?

Broughton nods her head slowly through the smoke, studying
his voice.

BROUGHTON
And you sound Polish, with a slight
affect of Slovak. Are you from the
Carpathian mountains?

BREMOVYCH
Impressive, Miss... ?
BROUGHTON
Lloyd.
BREMOVYCH
This can’t be your only talent.
BROUGHTON
Talents can be overrated.
BREMOVYCH
Now dedication, Loyalty that is
rare.
BROUGHTON
I agree.

Broughton goes back to her Stoli.

BREMOVYCH
How do you like Berlin, Ms. Lloyd?

BROUGHTON
Exciting, so far. Mr?

BREMOVYCH
Bremovych. Are you on holiday?

BROUGHTON
On business.

BREMOVYCH
Aren’t we all.

A woman steps to the bar behind Broughton. This is DELPHINE
LASALLE. She’s a mixture of punk rock and Peter Beard muse.
This the same woman who was watching Broughton at the airport
and on the street.
38.

LASALLE
I leave you alone for only a moment
and already you are attracting
admirers.

Lasalle turns to Bremovych.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
Monsieur, three is not always a
crowd, but tonight it is.

BREMOVYCH
Ahhh... French women.

Bremovych looks at Broughton.

BREMOVYCH (CONT’D)
What about the British? Maybe we
can make some sort of arrangement?

BROUGHTON
I don’t think so.

BREMOVYCH
My apologies. Good evening.

Broughton shares a look with Bremovych, and then he exits
past the restaurant tables towards the coat check.

BROUGHTON
Whoever you are, you have quite the
high level of confidence.

LASALLE
No more than that communist pig.

Lasalle watches Bremovych leave and then turns back to
Broughton with a smile that could end the Cold War.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
My name is Delphine LaSalle, and I
am at your service.

BROUGHTON
What makes you think I need your
service, mademoiselle?

Lasalle gestures to the Bartender for a drink.

LASALLE
A woman drinking alone is always in
need of something. Allow me to be
presumptuous; are you here for work
or pleasure?
39.

BROUGHTON
I am a lawyer for the British
government. And you?

LASALLE
I was raised in Paris in the 18th
arrondissement. My parents were
teachers, and I made my way to West
Berlin after studying at the
Sorbonne.

BROUGHTON
A respectable story. And what
brought you here?

LASALLE
The danger of course.

The Bartender sets down a tumbler in front of Lasalle.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
And a broken heart.

BROUGHTON
I’m sure he regrets losing you.

LaSalle smiles.

LASALLE
I am sure she does.

LaSalle takes a drink and lets her sexuality hang in the air
for a moment.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
You must join me for a drink.

BROUGHTON
What are we doing now?

LASALLE
This place is pretentious. My
friend owns a club, and I know the
city well. You’d be surprised what
secrets one overhears late at night
out on the town.

BROUGHTON
Secrets?

LASALLE
What every woman loves.
40.
BROUGHTON
The French will never change.
LASALLE
It’s our charm... I'll give you the
address. Tomorrow night, around
eleven.

Lasalle writes out the address on a cocktail napkin.

We see several paparazzi start a frenzy of STROBES by the
front door.

BROUGHTON
What is that about?

LASALLE
David Hasselhoff is in town.

Lasalle slides the address in front of Broughton.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
Until then.

Lasalle moves towards the crowd of photographers and out onto
the street. We see Perceval watching from a corner table, a
safe distance from being noticed by Broughton.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - CITY MORGUE - DAY

SUPER: “NOVEMBER 4, 1989”

Broughton walks up the wide, brick steps of a government
building.

We see Lasalle across the street, watching Broughton enter
the West Berlin City Morgue.
INT. WEST BERLIN - CITY MORGUE - MOMENTS LATER

The CORONER walks Broughton through the spotless corridors.

CORONER
The body was identified by your
attaché.
BROUGHTON
I believe so.
CORONER
This was not a question... It was a

statement.
41.

BROUGHTON
I am sorry. This is the first time
I've been sent to do this. I was
told you'd have his passport.

CORONER
It will be released with the body.
After you, Ms. Lloyd.

The Coroner holds the door open for Broughton.

INT. CITY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM — CONTINUOUS

A bright, sterile world. Along the wall, stainless steel
racks of cold storage hold dead bodies. The Coroner heaves a
cold rack open and pulls back a thin cotton sheet from the
body. Broughton stares down at James Gascione in the
stillness of death. There is a moment of contemplation for a
fallen friend or maybe more.

CORONER
He was your colleague?

BROUGHTON
A different department.

CORONER
Which department?

Broughton looks at the Coroner, nice try.

BROUGHTON
A different one.

CORONER
You have the transfer papers?

Broughton hands the transfer papers to him.
BROUGHTON
I filled them out while I was
waiting downstairs.

The Coroner studies the paperwork carefully.

CORONER
Wait one moment, please.

BROUGHTON
Is something the matter?

CORONER
The passport number is incorrect.
42.

BROUGHTON
There must be some mistake. The FCO
gave my attaché the number.

CORONER
It’s your responsibility to give me
the correct papers.

BROUGHTON
It’s obviously the right man.

The corner pulls the sheet over the body and pushes the cold
rack back into the wall.

CORONER
I will not release this body.

BROUGHTON
It’s a simple clerical error.

CORONER
Ms. Lloyd, in Germany we don’t make
clerical errors. I would advise you
to talk to your embassy in Bonn. I
must inform my superiors.

The Coroner moves back to the door and holds it open for
Broughton without another word.
INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - DAY

Perceval sits behind his bare desk with his dark eyes locked
onto Broughton.

PERCEVAL
What?!

BROUGHTON
You gave me the wrong number.

PERCEVAL
The hell I did.

Perceval grabs the morgue’s transfer papers from Broughton.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
You wrote “16” where it should have
been “76.”

Perceval slams the paper down onto his desk.
43.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
You realize the coroner will now
inform the chief of police of West
Berlin. They'll probably refuse to
release the body for another week
while they investigate. Not to
mention they'll now suspect
Gascione was an officer.

Perceval pushes back from his desk and looks dead center into
Broughton’s eyes.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Let’s take a walk.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - WALL - DAY

Perceval and Broughton tread through the crisp afternoon
parallel to the colorful graffiti-covered concrete of the
Berlin Wall.

PERCEVAL
The passport number. You’re being
“creative.”

Broughton’s face shows nothing.

BROUGHTON
You said yourself it wouldn’t take
much time to pick up the body.

PERCEVAL
I should send you back to England.

BROUGHTON
I don’t think C would appreciate
that very much.

Perceval turns to Broughton.

PERCEVAL
Look... if you’re going to be here
for awhile, we had better play nice
with one another.

Two US ARMY jeeps with SOLDIERS from the 2nd Battalion 6th
Infantry patrol past. Perceval gestures towards the
Brandenburg Gate.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
How would you fancy a trip to the
East tonight? I have to go check
for word from Spyglass.
44,

BROUGHTON
You meeting him?

PERCEVAL
I never have. James turned him.
Spyglass hasn't surfaced since the
exchange of the list.

BROUGHTON
What about Bakhtin? London said he
mostly likely had it.

PERCEVAL
Trust your gut. If Bakhtin wanted
the Russians to have it he would
have given it to them. He knows the
importance of that list. Bakhtin
gone so deep we won't find him
until he comes up to make his move.

They climb the stairs of a wooden observation platform for
tourists and West Germans to see over the Wall to the East.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

Look at it... Berlin is a city
under siege, surrounded by seventy
miles of barbed wire and concrete,
three hundred and ten guard towers,
sixty-five anti-vehicle trenches,
and forty thousand heavily-armed
Soviet-trained frontier troops.

BROUGHTON
All that and five thousand of the
GDR citizens still had the guts to
escape.

Perceval points and moves his hand along the ribbon of
concrete. He stops at a tenebrific group of buildings on the
eastern side of the Wall.

PERCEVAL
There’s a letter box around the
back of Gantzstrasse. Terrified or
not, if Spyglass knows anything, he
is supposed to leave word at that
dead drop.

BROUGHTON
Home office said Spyglass had
exposed an Allied double codenamed
Satchel.
45.

PERCEVAL
Nonsense. I’ve heard about Satchel
for years.

BROUGHTON
You don’t think he is real?

PERCEVAL
Look if he exists, which I highly
doubt, he has more at stake than
anyone. When this wall comes down
Satchel will be ducking bullets
from both sides.

Perceval looks at Broughton and sizes up the moment.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

Let's drop the official pretense.
Everything in this conversation can
be off the record.

Broughton nods.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
London sends you to gather a body
and orders us both to find a list.
Why?

BROUGHTON
Because the KGB killed Gascione and
took the list from him.

PERCEVAL
Partly true... Look, We are all on
the damn list. You. Me. Every one
of us, patriots and traitors alike.

BROUGHTON
That’s a bold statement.

PERCEVAL
You do this job long enough, you
become fairly accurate.

BROUGHTON
Let’s not forget what we do for a
living. We turn people against
their closest friends, family
members, and the very countries
they profess to love. We exploit,
corrupt, and bribe business and
government officials for any scrap
of advantage... Win at all costs.
PERCEVAL
The two World Wars in this century
alone makes that rather clear.

BROUGHTON
To win once, you can play by the
rules, but to win every time, you
have to play dirty... You think
London is worried for other
reasons?

PERCEVAL
I know they are. This list is about
covering the Queen’s ass not the
officers that serve the Crown.

BROUGHTON
Welcome to Berlin.

Perceval smiles at his own words being repeated to him.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
You're not worried Spyglass could
be setting us up?

PERCEVAL
It’s a possibility. Even if the
Soviets knew, I doubt the KGB would
try to turn Spyglass back or even
pay for a train ticket to Siberia.

BROUGHTON
What would they pay for?

Perceval calmly replies:

PERCEVAL
A bullet.

The two stand in silence and look out over the Wall to the
colorless East beyond. The stakes are clear to both of them:

life or death.

BROUGHTON
I can’t cross tonight. I’m meeting
someone.

PERCEVAL

The little mademoiselle from the
bar last night?

Broughton glances at Perceval.
47.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
I tell you to go to the Ritz for
venison, and you go to the Palm for
drinks.

Perceval studies Broughton for a second.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
You think you’re the only one doing
their job?

Broughton says nothing.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Just be careful. You can’t trust
Frenchies.

Perceval walks down the wooden stairs and leaves Broughton
standing alone on the observation platform.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Broughton removes thin wire from her body and sets it back
into the hardcover book. We see several fully recorded SN
mirco tapes on the desk. Broughton stands on the bed, slides
a ceiling tile back and places the novel, Narga SN and
recorded tapes in the small space and slides the ceiling tile
back.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - ZOO STATION/WATCH REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

The night sky is without warmth. Broughton walks along the
rain-soaked Kurfiirstendamm. West Germans mill about the
shopping district.

Broughton moves into the crowds at Zoo Station and exits out
the other side. She crosses the quiet street, looks over her
shoulder once to confirm no one is following her and then
enters the small watch repair shop.

INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS
Broughton proceeds to the back towards the workshop. The
Watchmaker is hunched over another Swiss watch, never looking
up from his work.
WATCHMAKER
Your watch is ready. It’s on the

counter in that plain envelope.

Broughton picks up the plain envelope.
48.
BROUGHTON
How much do I owe you?
WATCHMAKER
If it works to your satisfaction,

we can discuss payment.

Broughton puts the plain envelope inside her coat pocket
without looking inside.

BROUGHTON
Very well.

Broughton looks at the Watchmaker for a moment and then
leaves.

PRE-LAP on soundtrack: “The Politics of Dancing” by Re-Flex.

INT. PIKE CLUB - NIGHT

The smoke-heavy room is full of West Berlin’s new wave youth.
Lasalle stands at the back of the room near the crowded bar
as Broughton enters and approaches her.

LASALLE
I wasn’t certain you would show.

BROUGHTON
How could I resist your invitation?

Broughton lights a cigarette.

LASALLE
You are finished with your work?

BROUGHTON
I may be here for a while.

LASALLE
Then we have to enjoy ourselves.

Lasalle hands Broughton a glass of Stoli on ice.

BROUGHTON
You pay attention.

LaSalle lifts her drink in salute.

LASALLE
I look for pleasure in the details.

BROUGHTON
I’m sure.
49.

LASALLE
What is it you’d like from me?

In one movement, Broughton lifts and empties her glass of
vodka.

BROUGHTON
Another drink to start.

LaSalle orders another round.

LASALLE
Are you enjoying the club?

BROUGHTON
Not really. It’s pretentious.

LaSalle smiles at Broughton, leans closer and whispers in her
ear.

LASALLE
May I take you somewhere quiet,
where we can talk?

Broughton looks at LaSalle and off that look --

INT. PIKE CLUB - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Broughton pushes Lasalle against the hallway wall, kissing
her softly, then harder and with more passion.

LASALLE
Ma cherie.
(beat)
This is how you like it?

BROUGHTON
Oh yes.

Broughton pushes open the club’s bathroom door just as two
young punks exit.
INT. PIKE CLUB - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Broughton locks the bathroom door as her winter coat falls to
the floor.

LASALLE
You like to play rough?

BROUGHTON
Sometimes.
50.
Broughton’s hand wraps around the small of Lasalle’s back and
pulls a concealed handgun from Lasalle’s lean waist.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
When I’m the one holding the gun.

LASALLE
Wait!

BROUGHTON
You've been following me since I
arrived at Tempelhof -- outside the
city morgue and my colleague's
apartment.

LASALLE

You are mistaken.

Broughton backhands Lasalle across the face, sending her to
the floor.

BROUGHTON
Why the gun?

Lasalle looks up with a thin stream of blood at the corner of
her perfect mouth.

LASALLE
Berlin is a dangerous city.

BROUGHTON
Especially if you keep lying.

Lasalle stares up the barrel of her own gun.

LASALLE
I know who you are, Miss Broughton.
You're not so well disguised as MI6
may think. You’re here, of course,
because of the death of Gascione.

Broughton holds the weapon steady.

BROUGHTON

What do you know about his death?
LASALLE

Only that I am interested... If

someone is killing Allied officers,
shouldn’t we all care?

BROUGHTON
You're with DSGE?
51.

Lasalle nods her head.

LASALLE
Why do you think your colleague was
sanctioned?

BROUGHTON
He was carrying a document.

LASALLE
That list is very sensitive.

Broughton cocks the hammer back on the pistol and drops the
safety off.

BROUGHTON
I never said list. I said document.

LASALLE
My colleagues in Paris were right.
They informed me the “document” is
very valuable. This is why you were
talking to the watchmaker. Your
looking for Bakhtin?

BROUGHTON
There is a good chance it will
float onto the black market. If
Bremovych is still looking for it,
Bakhtin hasn’t handed it off and
clearly has other plans.

Lasalle leans over and picks up Broughton’s winter coat.
LASALLE
If it’s still in Berlin, it will
surface. You must be careful. You
are vulnerable.
Lasalle hands Broughton her coat.
BROUGHTON
You're a better liar than my
station chief.

LASALLE
To be a spy takes a steady hand.

BROUGHTON
Mademoiselle.

Broughton de-cocks LaSalle’s pistol and thumbs the safety on.
52.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Let me show you what takes a steady
hand.

Broughton pulls Lasalle closer, and they fall...

INT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

.»+. onto the sheets of a simple bed. Lasalle’s hand pushes
back along the wall... her fingers climbing against its rough
surface, finding the light switch.

Broughton looks straight into Lasalle’s eyes which read equal
parts temptation and fear. Broughton leans in, kisses her and
gently bites her lower lip.

Lasalle’s hand pulls down against the light switch and the
bedroom goes dark.

EXT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT BUILDING/INT. PERCEVAL’S SAAB - DAWN

Broughton sits on the edge of the bed and exhales her
cigarette smoke out the open window. The cold air feels good.
Lasalle awakes... We see Broughton’s coat slung over the
chair. RACK FOCUS... Outside the window.

A beat-to-hell Saab 900 Turbo stands out among the street of
parked cars. Perceval lowers a high-powered Nikon F3 and
telephoto lens. We see a “Seceret Service Style” ear bud in
his ear. The headlights of the Saab illuminate, and Perceval
pulls out into the morning.

HARDCUT BACK TO:

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY

Broughton leans forward and taps her Woodbine in the ashtray.
A dozen used cigarettes rest there now. Gray threads a fresh
reel to reel onto the NAGRA III and CLICKS record.

GRAY
So you made contact with the French
operative.

BROUGHTON
Yes... You could say that.

GRAY

Could she be Satchel?
53.

BROUGHTON
No.

Gray looks at Kurzfeld and then scribbles a note into the TS
folder.

GRAY
What was your assessment?

BROUGHTON
I believed she had information that
I could either use or exploit.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

An etiolated morning light comes through the window.
Broughton has the open plain envelope on the small desk in
front of her.

Broughton takes apart the back of the Ruhla wristwatch with a
small screwdriver. She releases the pressure from the main
spring and disassembles the watch movement using the pry
points.

Broughton lifts the wheel plate and turns it over with a
small tweezer.

We see engraved on the inside are a column of numbers.

Broughton removes the escape and sweep wheels. She sets them
on the desk with the rest of the internal parts.

Broughton lays out a map of West and East Berlin. She looks
at the column of engraved numbers.

First number in the sequence is 06. Broughton finds the
number 06 on the map, and it tallies with Checkpoint Charlie.

Broughton looks to the next number: 7E. Broughton takes the
tiny sweep wheel from the watch and rolls it on its edge 7
times in the direction of East, matching the 7E directive,
and lands on the next engraved number 01.

Broughton repeats this action from position 01. 3N is the
next number, and Broughton rolls the sweep wheel 3 times in
the direction of North. She lands on number 12 on the grid
coords of her map.

Broughton looks to the engraved numbers again. 2E is the last
number. Broughton rolls across the map 2 times in the
direction of East. She stops, lifts the sweep wheel and marks
the rendezvous point on the map.
54.

Broughton commits every detail of the map to her memory and
begins to reassemble the watch.

EXT. CHECKPOINT CHARLIE - DAY
SUPER: “NOVEMBER 5, 1989”

Broughton waits to cross into East Berlin. A formidable-
looking EAST GERMAN GUARD stares down at Broughton’s
passport, then back into her face.

EAST GERMAN GUARD
You should have applied for a
visitor’s permit. What kind of work
do you do?

BROUGHTON
Legal affairs, I’m a lawyer.

The East German Guard looks down again at her passport.

EAST GERMAN GUARD
Wait here.

The East German Guard takes her papers and speaks with his
SUPERIOR as Broughton waits. The East German Guard makes a
phone call, then returns with Broughton’s passport and hands
it back to her.

EAST GERMAN GUARD (CONT’D)
If you do not return before six
o'clock, you will be arrested. Do
you understand?

BROUGHTON
Yes. Of course.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY

Broughton moves past an assembly of protesting EAST GERMAN
YOUTH near the blank concrete Wall.

Broughton walks the local streets. As she moves, she glances
at her reflection in a store window.

We see two young STASI OFFICERS shadowing her.

Broughton steps up her pace. The two Stasi officers continue
to follow her.

Broughton moves through a crowded S-Bahn station and out the
other side. The Stasi still follow... farther back now.
55.
Broughton moves towards a large set of shops at the base of
the East Berlin TV tower.
We see a government sedan pull to the curb.
The Stasi officers turn to the government sedan. Bremovych
and his driver are in the front seat. In the rear seat sit
two KGB officers, the same two rough men from Gascione’s

assassination.

BREMOVYCH
Bring her to me.

The KGB officers step from the back of the car and join the
two Stasi officers. Broughton now has double the trouble
walking towards her.

EXT. KINO INTERNATIONAL CINEMA - CONTINUOUS

Broughton moves towards a local cinema named the Kino
International.

INT. KINO INTERNATIONAL CINEMA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Broughton moves through the doors and into the mid-century
modern lobby.

THEATER

Broughton quickly moves into the dark and packed theater. The
Stasi and KGB officers chase after her.

We see Richard Attenborough’s “CRY FREEDOM” and a young
Denzel Washington on the screen.

Broughton egresses through the row of people, running down
the aisle, then behind the aged-silk movie screen.

Broughton reaches up onto the movie theater wall and pulls
down hard on the FIRE ALARM!

The audience jumps from their seats and floods the exits as
the Stasi and KGB pursue Broughton.

Broughton melts into the crowd and disappears out the back
doors in the mass exodus of patrons.
56.

EXT. KINO INTERNATIONAL CINEMA - MOMENTS LATER

Bremovych and his driver pull to the curb at the rear of the
movie theater. The Stasi and KGB search the crowd outside for
Broughton. Nothing.

BREMOVYCH
Keep looking for her.

The two KGB officers move away from Bremovych’s sedan and
back towards the crowd.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY

Broughton moves through the bombed-out neighborhood left over
from the Second World War. She enters an abandoned building
on the southwest corner of Arnimplatz.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - ROOFTOP —- CONTINUOUS

Broughton moves up a set of crumbling stairs towards the
roof. The Berlin Radio Tower looms close. Broughton steps
onto the rooftop.

We see the young Bartender from the East German Club sitting
in one of two lawn chairs on the roof. His newly-dyed hair
and tattoos are visible from under his plain jacket.

This is MERKEL.

MERKEL (BARTENDER)
You're late.

BROUGHTON
I know.

MERKEL
And you were followed.

BROUGHTON
I lost them twenty minutes ago near
the Palast der Republik.

MERKEL
You're as good as your reputation.

BROUGHTON
I'm already known by reputation?

MERKEL
To the right people.
57.

Merkel sits in one of the lawn chairs and looks out across
the drab rooftops to the West.

BROUGHTON
Is this the best place for a rendez-
vous?

Merkel points towards the Orwellian tower.

MERKEL
Keep your enemies close. Please
have a seat.

BROUGHTON
No thanks.

MERKEL
The watchmaker told me there has
been great interest in the black
market over the last few days.

BROUGHTON
I am looking for --
MERKEL
A list... It is the desire of you

and every foreign officer.

BROUGHTON
Do you know who has it?

MERKEL
Some say Bakhtin has it others say
he doesn’t.

BROUGHTON
Where is he?

MERKEL
No one knows. All this talk of
Satchel has people nervous on both
sides of the wall.

BROUGHTON
If Bakhtin or the list surface you
must let me know.

MERKEL
The price will be extremely high.

BROUGHTON
We will not be outbid.

Broughton hands Merkel a fist full of Deutschmarks.
58.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Five thousand marks to get you
started.

Broughton moves across the rooftop and down the dilapidated
staircase.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM

Broughton laces the wire and SN mirco recording device back
onto her body with flawless detail. Checks herself in the
mirror, grabs her coat, and is out the door.

INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT

The Watchmaker is busy at work, when a solitary man enters
the shop and moves towards the back to speak to him. Only

when the man arrives do we reveal it is Bakhtin.

BAKHTIN
I am interested in selling a watch?

The watchmaker continues his accurate work.

WATCHMAKER
Tell me what you are selling?

BAKHTIN
It’s extremely valuable and the
finest quality.
The watchmaker looks up at Bakhtin.
WATCHMAKER
You have my complete attention.
EXT. WEST BERLIN - NIGHT
The neon signs are bright. The KaDaWe department store is
open late, and all is bustling along the kKurfiirstendamm.
INT. WEST BERLIN - ROUGH TRADE BAR - NIGHT
It’s a leather bar. On the wall, a mural-sized painting of a
young Ronald Reagan in biker chaps 4 la “Daddy and the Muscle
Academy” by Tom of Finland.

We hear “You Spin Me Round” by Dead or Alive PLAYING on a
JUKEBOX.
The room is filled with men enjoying men and women
women. Save for Perceval and Broughton, who sit in
vinyl booth against a wall.

PERCEVAL
Berlin is like a beautiful woman
gone bad.

BROUGHTON

That why you like it here so much?

PERCEVAL
Nowhere else in the world has such
a concentration of musicians,
artists, filthy squatters, junkies,
and hedonists. I don’t like it
here. I love Berlin.

59.

enjoying
a red

Broughton looks across at two men wearing full dress whites,

clearly more Village People than US military.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Spyglass left us a message. We
guarantee safe passage, and he will
cross over.

BROUGHTON
Why take the risk when we can just
wait until the Wall comes down?

Perceval raises his beer, about to drink.

PERCEVAL
The entire Soviet bloc is on edge.
Haven’t you seen the bloody
protests on the news?

BROUGHTON
I saw one this morning on Unter den
Linden.

Perceval stares at her, his beer still as stone in front of

him. He slowly lowers the glass.

PERCEVAL
You went to the East? What in the
hell were you thinking?

BROUGHTON
That it was best you didn’t know.

PERCEVAL
Why not?
60.

BROUGHTON
Deniability.

Perceval leans forward for impact.

PERCEVAL
This isn’t a goddamn game. NATO has
over ten thousand warheads, and the
Russians have half that number.

Perceval stares at Broughton.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
So while you skip around the East,
try and grasp the blowback if
something were to happen to you.

BROUGHTON
Nothing happened, and I needed to
secure the trust of my contact.

PERCEVAL
You can’t trust the Frenchie?
BROUGHTON
This contact is a man.
PERCEVAL
Well now, you are playing all the
angles.
BROUGHTON

We need ground truth to find that
list. I won’t need to go over
again.

PERCEVAL
On the contrary. Spyglass is in
hiding and desperate to get out.
Gascione’s death has everybody
jumpy. Right now, the people in the
Stasi don’t know if they’re going
to be staring at a firing squad or
freedom.

BROUGHTON
This is my first time in Berlin.

PERCEVAL
I’m not sure if I believe you.

Broughton leans back into the booth slightly.
61.

BROUGHTON
Believe what you want.

PERCEVAL
Spyglass is an asset that we can’t
lose. Right now, he is scared, and
scared people make mistakes.

BROUGHTON
We need him out before the KGB or
the Stasi discover his treason.

Perceval quickly scans around their table and firmly grabs
Broughton’s arm to get her attention.

PERCEVAL
Keep your voice down. I’m still
your number one, and you work for
me.

Broughton says nothing, only looks at Perceval’s hand on her
bicep. Perceval gets the point and releases his grip.

BROUGHTON
Don’t ever touch me again. Now you
listen. I am here on C’s direct
orders. My work does concern you,
but you’re mistaken to think it’s
under your purview.

Broughton stands and shoulders her winter coat.
BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
I don’t have to take orders from
you. So with all due respect, you
can go fuck yourself.

Broughton walks out the door without another word.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - NIGHT

Cold rain. Perceval steps outside as Broughton walks down the
sidewalk.

BROUGHTON
(to herself)
Come on... 3... 2... 1...

Perceval jogs after her.

PERCEVAL
Wait.
62.

Perceval catches up to Broughton at a taxi stand.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
I can’t operate alone on this one.

BROUGHTON
So get the American. Kurzfeld seems
happy to share your bed.

PERCEVAL
Out of the question. The Americans
would have Spyglass on an aircraft
back to Langley without his feet
ever touching the ground. I need
your help.

Perceval extends his hand.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Truce?

Broughton takes a moment, and then her hand meets his.

BROUGHTON
Don’t make me regret it.

Broughton releases his hand, opens the taxi door and gestures
for Perceval to join her.

INT./EXT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Broughton looks to the German TAXI DRIVER and then to
Perceval.

BROUGHTON
Kasier Whelm.

Broughton glances towards the taxi driver, and Perceval knows
without saying anything (For operational security use a
geminate-conversation). Broughton speaks Arabic. Perceval
replies in Bahasa.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
(in Arabic)
Bakhtin is a ghost.

PERCEVAL
(in Bahasa)
Seems to be.

BROUGHTON
(in Arabic)
Did Spyglass photograph the list?
63.

PERCEVAL
(in Bahasa)
No. He committed the entire list to
memory.

BROUGHTON
(in Arabic)
Then if we have Spyglass, we won't
need the list.

PERCEVAL
(in Bahasa)
Precisely, We break him out. Don’t
worry I can make allowances for you
being unseasoned.

BROUGHTON
(in Arabic)
I’ve jumped the curtain more times
than you have wished Maggie
Thatcher dead.

PERCEVAL
(in Bahasa)
Not here... not in Berlin.

BROUGHTON
(in Arabic)
What about the tunnels? When was
the last time they were used?

PERCEVAL
(in Bahasa)
Stay out of the tunnels. We need
something out of the box.

Broughton takes a moment and then replies with confidence.

BROUGHTON
(in Arabic)
The East Germans are planning a
large demonstration at
Alexanderplatz. The Stasi security
services will be spread thin.

The taxi slows to a stop.

We see they’re outside the bombarded ruins of the Kasier
Whelm Memorial Church.

Perceval hands the driver several D-marks and exits.
Broughton follows him onto the sidewalk. They now return to
English.
64.

PERCEVAL
Bring him out in daylight?

BROUGHTON
We will use the protest as cover.

PERCEVAL
It’s bold.

Broughton’s determination is clear to Perceval.

BROUGHTON
You get us in and I’1l get us out.

PERCEVAL
Deal... Where do you want Spyglass
to meet us? I’1l drop hima
message.

BROUGHTON
There is an abandoned building on
the southwest corner of Arnimplatz.
I'll need two days with my contact
to make the arrangements.

Perceval nods.

PERCEVAL
One more thing, your Arabic is piss
poor.

Broughton turns, and without missing a beat, calls out over
her shoulder.

BROUGHTON
And your Bahasa is shit.

Perceval watches her go, then lifts his coat collar to the
cold and moves out alone into the night.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - DAY

SUPER: “NOVEMBER 7, 1989”

Broughton wears a jet black wig and a simple brown overcoat.
She enters an S-Bahn station.

EXT. S-BAHN STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Broughton waits on the platform on the U6 line. The train
arrives, and she steps into the matte-red train car.
65.

INT. U6 TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

The car is empty as Broughton sits next to Perceval. The
train rolls down the tracks towards East Berlin.

PERCEVAL
Next stop is Friedrichstrasse. On
the south side of the station there
is a green service door marked
“Diensteingang” for the Deutshe
Reichsbahn employees.

The train begins to slow for the upcoming station.
PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
The Red Army terror cell and the
West German communist party used it
for years. On January 18, 1979, I
led out the East German double
Werner Stiller.

BROUGHTON
That was you.

PERCEVAL
My first dance, and I’ve been using
the breach point for the last ten
years.
Broughton and Perceval stand to exit.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Just do as I do.

The doors open, and they step out into the station.

INT./EXT. S-BAHN STATION #2 - CONTINUOUS

They walk through the station until they reach a green metal
door marked just as Perceval said: “Diensteingang.”

Perceval waits a beat for several workers to pass and then
produces a small key and opens the door.

Broughton and Perceval slip inside without a wasted movement.
CONTROL ROOM/HALLWAYS

They move through an empty control room and down several
dimly-light hallways until they reach an exterior door.

PERCEVAL
Hold.
66.

Perceval looks out through the dirty industrial glass window
at four East German guards standing at attention across the
street. Perceval looks at the sweep hand of his watch.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
They turn their backs at the
changing of the guard.

Outside, four more East German guards goose step towards the
group standing at attention. Perceval locks eyes onto
Broughton.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Three seconds to get out of this
door and around the building before
we're seen.

Outside, the guards goose step to a stop. As their comrades
step off duty, the others step forward.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Now.

Perceval opens the metal service door, and they exit ina
steady walk. Broughton and Perceval turn the corner just as
the East German guards pivot and stand at attention, never
seeing them exit the station.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - NEIGHBORHOOD/ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Broughton and Perceval move through a barren neighborhood and
quickly enter the door of the abandoned building.

From across the street, Spyglass watches their movements with
apprehension.
INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Broughton and Perceval descend the stairs to the basement. As
they turn the corner, they find Merkel waiting.

MERKEL
Ms. Lloyd speaks highly of you.

Perceval looks to Broughton.

PERCEVAL
And you as well.

At the top of the stairs, Spyglass appears, and all three of
them turn. Broughton motions to Merkel.
67.

BROUGHTON
Watch the street to make sure he
wasn’t followed.

Merkel nods and moves up the stairs past Spyglass. Perceval
steps forward towards Spyglass.

PERCEVAL
I am confident Ms. Lloyd can get
you across.

Broughton approaches Spyglass and holds out a small package
from Perceval’s office.

BROUGHTON
You smell like a Stasi officer.

Broughton gestures to a small adjoining room.
BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
There is a bucket of water. Shave
off your moustache. Use this soap
and cologne, it is from the West.

Spyglass takes the package and does as he is told.

PERCEVAL
How big is this protest supposed to
be, anyway?

BROUGHTON

Thousands.
Merkel comes back down the stairs.

MERKEL
He wasn’t followed.

Merkel steps to a small table and rolls out a kitchen towel.
Inside the towel is a Markov pistol.

MERKEL (CONT'D)
Per your request.

Broughton chamber-checks the weapon and indexes the trigger
perfectly to her hand. Broughton closes her eyes, feels the
pistol’s weight, then finally looks down at the crisp profile
of the front sight.

We have just witnessed flawless muscle memory and Broughton’s
mastery of a weapon.

BROUGHTON
It will do.
68.

Broughton seats a loaded magazine, racks the slide and thumbs
the safety. Clocked and locked, she slips the pistol into her
waistband.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Everything else ready?

MERKEL
Yes. All the details you requested.
I’1l lead you around the corner
towards Alexanderplatz and let you
handle the crossing.

SPYGLASS
I am ready.

Broughton turns back to a clean-shaven Spyglass.

BROUGHTON
What about his shirt?

MERKEL
I wouldn't be caught dead in it,
but for him, it’s prefect.

BROUGHTON
Stand over here.

A 6x6 foot patch of the wall has been freshly painted pale
yellow. Spyglass stands in front of the yellow patch.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Face him and look like a free man.

Merkel steps forward and with a POLAROID LAND CAMERA --
CLICK! FLASH! -- Merkel pulls the film from the camera back,
steps aside to a small folding card table and gets to work.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
What did you tell your commanding
officer?

SPYGLASS
I was going to tell him I was sick,
but my family and I’ve been in
hiding since the other night.

Spyglass is about say more when Perceval interrupts.
PERCEVAL

Do you know anyone at
Oberbaumbriicke?
69.

SPYGLASS
No.

BROUGHTON
Any colleagues?

SPYGLASS
No. They are all at the
demonstration. I checked the work
rotations weeks ago.

Merkel hands Perceval a forged West German passport. Perceval
opens the lead page. Spyglass’s new photo is attached and
stamped perfectly with the DDR-embossed seal. Perceval hands
it to Spyglass.

BROUGHTON
You are Johann Schmidt, resident of
West Berlin. I am your English
wife, Mary. You are a banker, and
we have a daughter.

SPYGLASS
What is her age? My daughter is
four.

BROUGHTON

Then she is four.
Broughton looks to Perceval.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
We have been visiting your brother
Hans on this street. Memorize all
of this, because you will be doing
the talking. My German is terrible.

SPYGLASS
Who sends a woman who speaks no
German?

PERCEVAL

The same people who are going to

give you a cottage in the

countryside with a little garden.
Spyglass looks at Merkel, who says nothing.

BROUGHTON
Take off all your clothes.

Spyglass turns around, visibly unsettled by her request.
70.

SPYGLASS
I will not be treated like I ama
common prisoner.

Broughton glances at Perceval and then back to Spyglass.

BROUGHTON
Shut up... You do what I say when I
say it. You have two minutes to
strip naked. Everything! You will
take nothing from the East to the
West. Nothing. Do you understand?

Spyglass stares at her silently. Broughton points at the
package wrapped in brown paper sitting on the table.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
That’s underwear, socks, clothes,
shoes, belt, scarf, and coat.

Merkel sets down a wallet and a set of keys next to the brown
paper package of clothes.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
You now have a wallet, forged
documents, German driver's license,
bank card, Dmarks, and house and
car keys.

Spyglass just stands there.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Herr Schmidt, you have ninety
seconds.

Spyglass strips down completely naked and begins to pull on
the underwear and socks. Then, we hear a NOISE and Broughton
draws and levels her pistol at the top of the stairs.

SPYGLASS
No!

MERKEL
(in German)
Show yourself!

From the darkness appears a plainly-dressed East German woman
(HELENA) and a young girl of four years (AUDREY). Merkel
looks at the woman and child.

MERKEL (CONT'D)
Jordache. Nice touch.

Perceval turns to Spyglass.
71.

PERCEVAL
Who the hell is this?

SPYGLASS
My family.

PERCEVAL

I told you I couldn’t guarantee to
get them across.

Half-dressed, Spyglass moves towards his wife and child.

SPYGLASS
Please, you must help us.

Broughton looks at Perceval.

BROUGHTON
You said you never met Spyglass.

Perceval remains silent, and Broughton looks to Spyglass.

SPYGLASS
Of course we have met.

PERCEVAL
Enough!

Spyglass stops talking. His wife and child are frightened.

BROUGHTON
Where?!

SPYGLASS
At a bar in East Berlin.

Broughton turns to Perceval, who knows he has been caught. We
hear the CROWDS of demonstrators outside MARCHING.

MERKEL
The protest is coming.

Broughton doesn’t look away from Perceval.

BROUGHTON
You lied to me.

PERCEVAL
We're all liars, and you know that.
My lies are reserved for work. Now
you know the truth, so that makes
us friends.

Perceval looks to Spyglass, the woman and the little girl.
72.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
So let’s drop the righteousness and
get this family across.

We hear the SWELL of the CROWDS outside now. Broughton looks
at the scared faces of Spyglass and his family.

BROUGHTON
Can you get them over?

PERCEVAL
Yes.

Broughton turns back to group.

BROUGHTON
You will stay with me, Herr
Schmidt. You have 60 seconds to
finish getting dressed.

Spyglass hugs his wife and child and pulls the rest of his
clothes on.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY

Perceval scans the streets. Merkel hands Broughton an
umbrella at the doorway of the abandoned building. Spyglass
and his family are at his side. We hear the distant CROWDS
from Alexanderplatz.

MERKEL
Good luck.

The PROTESTERS slowly surge around the corner and begin to
march past them. Merkel steps into the loud crowd moving down
the streets.

Spyglass kisses his wife and daughter who have tears
streaming down their faces.

SPYGLASS
(in German; to daughter)
You must listen to your mother now,
and be a brave little girl.

Perceval removes a East German Ushanka (fur-lined officer's
hat) from his overcoat and puts it on his head. Perceval
takes off his overcoat to reveal the green uniform and
shoulder boards of an East German Oberst (Colonel).

Spyglass kisses his wife again.
73.

SPYGLASS (CONT'D)
(in German)
You must go with him now.

PERCEVAL
We'll see you in West Berlin.

Perceval and Spyglass’s family quickly blend into the
thousands of East Germans and disappear down a side street.

Broughton lifts her umbrella.

BROUGHTON
Let's go.

Broughton and Spyglass step into the groundswell of the
protest.

INT./EXT. BUILDING - 7TH FLOOR - DAY

The same two KGB rough men (from the Gascione assassination
and movie theater scene) are back, dressed in matching track
suits. They occupy a gutted room. One works as a SNIPER and
the other as his SPOTTER.

They're set back from the window behind a Dragunov rifle and
high-powered optics.

We see them scan the crowd below with precision, searching
for their target.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY

Broughton looks to Merkel in the crowd, then lifts her black
umbrella. Merkel nods, and throughout the crowd, dozens of
black umbrellas begin to open.

INT./EXT. BUILDING - 7TH FLOOR - SAME

The Sniper watches through his Dragunov scope as umbrellas
begin to pop up and conceal the protesters. The Sniper

glances at his spotter, who is unsure of what to do.

We see a sea of a hundreds of umbrellas on the streets below.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS

On the street, the crowd swells in size and closes the
distance to the border laced thick with concertina wire.
74.

The EAST GERMAN GUARDS watch the protesters as they advance
towards the Oberbaumbriicke checkpoint.

Broughton turns to Spyglass as he leans into her.

SPYGLASS
Ms. Lloyd.

Spyglass's face reveals distress as he takes a few weak steps
and staggers to his knees.

We see dark blood soaking down Spyglass’s back as the crowd
of protesters comes apart.

We hear a SHOT ECHO off of the tall buildings.

CHAOS!

Umbrellas drop to the ground. Broughton’s eyes scan through
the terrified protesters as East German Guards begin running
in all directions.

INT./EXT. BUILDING - 7TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The Spotter calls distance, bullet drop, and wind. The
Sniper’s trigger fires with a smooth cadence. They search the
street below for their target.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - CONTINUOUS

Across the street, Broughton pulls Spyglass behind a parked
car to safety.

SPYGLASS
I’ve been shot.

BROUGHTON
I know.

Broughton scans the buildings and rooftops. Another ROUND
DEFLECTS off the hood of the car and POUNDS into the wall of
the building.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
They have the high ground.

Broughton grabs the side mirror of the car and angles it back
towards the buildings. She is looking for the Sniper from the
trajectory of the incoming rounds.

We see the slight glint of a rifle’s optics.
75.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
I’ve got them.

Broughton pulls Spyglass’s scarf from around his neck and
hands it to him.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Listen to me. Apply direct
pressure.

SPYGLASS
I don’t want to die.

Broughton slaps Spyglass’s face as hard as she can to get his
complete attention.

BROUGHTON
You will NOT die! Say it.

Spyglass puts the scarf against his wound with new resolve.

SPYGLASS
I will not die... I will not die...
BROUGHTON
Direct pressure.
SPYGLASS
Direct pressure... I will not
die... Direct pressure...
BROUGHTON

Can you run?

SPYGLASS
If I must.

Broughton grabs Spyglass, and they sprint across the street
towards the base of the Sniper’s building.

INT. BUILDING - 7TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
The Spotter provides security in the doorway as the Sniper
breaks down and bags his rifle. The sniper team moves out

into the hallway and SLIDES the bagged weapon down a coal
shoot.

INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

Broughton and Spyglass enter the lobby.
76.

BROUGHTON
Stay right here.

Spyglass leans against the base of the staircase. Broughton
takes off her coat and reverses it, quickly changing the
color from brown to green. Broughton exhales through her
nose, slows her heart rate, and heads up the stairs.

First floor... Second... Third... and, as she is turning the
corner to the fourth floor landing, the sniper team appears,
coming down two steps at a time.

SNIPER
Entschuldigung, fraulein.

Broughton passes them on the stairs, and they pass her.

We see Broughton’s pistol press against the back of the
Sniper’s head.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
That accent sounds distinctly
Muscovite to me.

Without hesitation, the young Sniper spins and disarms
Broughton. The PISTOL SKITTERS across the tile floor.

The Sniper draws and raises his own Markov when Broughton
charges and disarms the weapon.

FIGHT TIME!
Two highly-trained men against one bad-ass woman.

It is close. Brutal. And extremely violent. Punches, knees
and elbows thrown from both sides. The two men are relentless
with their attack on Broughton. The Sniper knees Broughton in
the face, and her body crumples to the floor, broken.

The Spotter picks Broughton up and is about to finish her off
when... Broughton smashes her head into the Spotter and
drives her thumb into the Sniper’s eye. Broughton’s body
slams against the wall, sending plaster dust into the air.

They fight on.

We watch as three savages beat the living hell out of each
other in a dingy staircase in East Berlin.

The Spotter leaps for the one of the disarmed pistols, but
Broughton is there to stop him. They struggle for the weapon
and roll across the landing.
77.

The Spotter pounds his fists into Broughton’s body. Broughton
escapes the barrage onto her back just as the Spotter raises
the Markov pistol to her head.

Broughton uncoils her body, thrusts her legs into his chest
and launches the Spotter backwards into the dazed Sniper.
They both disappear over the stair railing without so much as
a whimper.

Four floors of FREE FALL and then they SLAM onto the lobby
floor next to Spyglass. Broughton picks up her pistol from
the floor and calmly walks down the stairs. Broughton picks
up the second pistol from the lobby floor and then steps past
the two dead bodies.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Let's go.

Broughton and Spyglass move on. Broughton never looks back.

EXT. EAST BERLIN - DAY

Broughton and Spyglass move down the street littered with
black umbrellas.

SPYGLASS
I can't.

BROUGHTON
Yes, you can.

Two unarmed EAST GERMAN GUARDS see Broughton supporting
Spyglass, who’s soaked in blood.

EAST GERMAN GUARD
Halt!

The two East German Guards jog towards them.

BROUGHTON
Keep walking.

EAST GERMAN GUARD
Halt!

Broughton turns and points her pistol directly at the two
unarmed East German Guards. They back away, hands in the air,
and then turn and break into a full run.

Broughton sees what she wants. She takes two steps to a
parked Trabant sedan.
78.

SPYGLASS
How can you be so confident?

BROUGHTON
I allow for no other option.

Broughton swings the door open and grabs a handful of wires
beneath the dash. A few seconds is all Broughton needs to get
the engine turned over.

Broughton shifts her eyes down the street several blocks.

We see a dozen East German frontier troops running up the
hill toward them with their weapons drawn.

INT./EXT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS
Broughton watches in the rear-view mirror.

BROUGHTON
Hold on.

Broughton jams the sedan in drive, cuts the wheel hard and
spins out across the cobblestone streets. The East Germans
jump into several military cars and give chase after
Broughton.

This is FRENCH CONNECTION meets BULLITT but through the
streets of East Berlin 1989!

Broughton races the stolen sedan through featureless
neighborhoods. A half-dozen East German military cars hunt
her at breakneck speed.

Broughton rallies down a narrow alleyway, out onto a wide
street and through a gauntlet of near misses. Two East German
military cars try to block her route. Broughton smashes
through a crude roadblock and spins the military cars like
tops.

Several more East Germans’ cars join in the hot pursuit.

Broughton’s side WINDOW EXPLODES and sends glass through the
sedan. Broughton has had enough.

Broughton slides to a stop, jams her sedan into reverse, then
draws and empties the Markov pistol out the windowless hole
to her side.

BULLETS STRIKE into the pack of pursuing military cars.

Broughton whips the sedan back around as three more East
German cars pile up in a smoking heap.
79.

SPYGLASS
We'll never... make it.

BROUGHTON
We'll make it.

Broughton’s sedan is up on the sidewalk, flying over and
through most every obstacle as the East German noose tightens
around her.

Out the window, the Friedrichstrasse Station can be seen a
few blocks away.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
It’s just ahead.

Broughton slides the sedan around the corner and towards the
station when a East German T55 tank rolls down the street at
them, stops and levels its big gun at them.

Broughton looks in her rear-view mirror at the military cars
coming up behind her. Broughton scans her surroundings.

Broughton reverses the tiny sedan.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Hold on!

Broughton yanks the steering wheel hard and slides the sedan
onto a narrow street above the Spree River. She jams it into
gear, and they race on.

Without warning, an East German military truck slams into the
sedan from a side street. The tiny sedan buckles on impact.
Broughton and Spyglass flip end over end and plunge into
Spree River.

The cold water pours into car from the shattered window. The
sedan quickly disappears and is consumed by the dark river.

Broughton remains calm as the cold water rushes in.

SPYGLASS
My foot is trapped.

Spyglass pulls at his trapped leg.

BROUGHTON
I’1l get you out.

Broughton unbuckles herself and leans across to aid Spyglass.
She pulls at his leg. Nothing. Broughton dives under the
rushing water and tries to release his foot. Nothing. She
surfaces, and the water continues to rise past their chests.
80.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
I WILL get you out!

Broughton is about to dive under the water again, when
Spyglass grabs her.

SPYGLASS
The last thing I am told can’t be
another lie.

Spyglass’'s eyes are pure and without fear. The water fills up
to both of their shoulders. Spyglass grabs Broughton’s hand.

SPYGLASS (CONT'D)
My wife, Helena, and daughter,
Audrey -- tell them I love them.
Promise me.

Broughton nods as the water reaches their necks.

BROUGHTON
I promise.

SPYGLASS
Go... Save yourself.

They each take one last breath as the cold water covers them.
Broughton holds onto Spyglass’s hand until his body convulses
and relaxes in death.

The tiny sedan twists in the river’s current. Broughton
pushes the car door open. She glances back at Spyglass’s
lifeless body and then never looks back again...

Broughton swims underwater through the wintry river. She
doesn’t have much time.

HARDCUT BACK TO:

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY
CLOSE ON THE NARGA III DECK
and the tail of the tape flapping on another full reel.

KURZFELD
Do you need to take a break?

BROUGHTON
No.
81.

Broughton lights another Woodbine and watches in silence as
Gray pulls the tape archive off of the deck, drops a fresh
one on and threads it.

GRAY
I am ready when you are.

Gray CLICKS record, and the reel starts back up again.

BACK TO:

EXT. SPREE RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

Broughton’s head breaks the surface, and she pulls herself up
against the wooden pylon of a boat dock out of sight.

She looks up the river to see dozens of East German soldiers
searching. Broughton struggles to pull herself onto the dock
as her body is quickly going hypothermic.

A CAR SKIDS to a stop on the street above of her.
We hear the DOOR OPEN and FOOTSTEPS approach her.

Broughton is desperate, fighting to warm her body as her cold
fingers fumble with her empty pistol.

We see boots run up and then stop next to an exhausted
Broughton.

MERKEL
I’m here.

Merkel grabs Broughton’s hyperborean body and quickly tosses
her into the warm car. Merkel speeds away with Broughton in
the passenger seat.

INT. EAST BERLIN - SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Broughton, wrapped in wool blankets, huddles around a coal
fire contained in a metal bucket. Merkel sits in the
flickering light.

MERKEL
What happened?

BROUGHTON
The KGB positioned a sniper team in
a building. I recognized them from
several days ago.
82.

MERKEL
You recognized them?

BROUGHTON
I caught up with them in the
stairwell of the building. They had
blue eyes. I killed them both.

Merkel looks at Broughton who shares no emotion. Broughton
stares at the fire and replays everything in her mind.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Perceval?

MERKEL
I lost him and Spyglass’s family in
the crowd. I am sure they are safe
in the West.

BROUGHTON
Spyglass is dead.

MERKEL
And you are alive.

Broughton’s still trying to put all the pieces together.

BROUGHTON
The KGB knew everything.

Broughton stands, blanket wrapped around her shoulders.
BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
I need to get across. I need to
call in and make contact with my
superiors.

Merkel stares at her for a moment in silence.

MERKEL
You're a strong woman.

BROUGHTON
I prefer it to good-looking and
useless.
Merkel stands.

MERKEL
Follow me.

Broughton follows Merkel down a faintly-lit hallway.
83.

MERKEL (CONT'D)
You must use the old tunnels.

Merkel kneels and lifts a false section in the floor,
revealing an opening within the tiles. Merkel hands Broughton
a metal flashlight.

MERKEL (CONT'D)
Walk until you see the metal
ladder, it will bring out in the
West.

Broughton lowers herself down into the dark hole and turns on
the flashlight.

INT. EAST BERLIN —- SEWERS - MOMENTS LATER

The flashlight’s yellow beam illuminates the damp tunnel.
Broughton walks in silence towards West Berlin for several
hundred yards until...

We see the beam of her flashlight cut across a dead man’s
body.

The cold has kept the body preserved with a foxed green hue
to the skin. Broughton kneels down for a closer look and
identifies the face warped by death.

BROUGHTON
(to herself)
Batkhin

Broughton quickly searches his pockets and body and finds
nothing of value. She stands and moves on past the KGB
officer’s corpse towards the West.

EXT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - DAY

Broughton stands in the cold and RINGS the BUZZER, which goes
unanswered. She tries again, nothing. Broughton moves back
out onto the streets and is on the move.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - DAY
SUPER: “NOVEMBER 8, 1989”

Broughton, wrapped in a towel, sits on the edge of her bed,
staring at the wall. Broughton’s emotions are just below the
surface of her face. She replays every detail in her mind.
Crossing over. The family. The snipers. How did the KGB
know? The car flooding with water. Spyglass’s death.
84.

How did the KGB know?

Suddenly, Broughton stands and moves through the room. She
takes apart the phone. Nothing. She looks in the lamps.
Nothing. Under the beds. Nothing. Window sills. Nothing.
Doors. Nothing. She searches for the device. Then, from
across the room, she sees her coat, still damp from the Spree
River.

Broughton inspects the buttons, pockets, and liner. She feels
along the collar and pulls a tiny UHF device and hard wire
out of the coat.

We hear POUNDING on her hotel door.

POLIZEI (0.S.)
Offen sie die tur! Polizei!

Broughton stuffs the device back into her coat just as...
We see the hotel door BURST open.

The POLIZEI enter with complete intimidation. They’re
followed by an older and very severe-looking FIRST CHIEF
INSPECTOR.

BROUGHTON
You have no right to break into my
hotel room! Who in the hell are
you?!

The First Chief Inspector points at the four silver stars on
his meticulous uniform.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
Ms. Lloyd. I'm First Chief
Inspector of this district, and
your rights here are not the same
as if you were in Knightsbridge.

BROUGHTON
I would like to call my attaché in
the British sector and see if he
agrees with you.

The First Chief Inspector narrows his eyes at the remark.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
A high ranking Stasi officer was
killed yesterday in East Berlin.
His body has been pulled from a
submerged car in the river.
85.

The First Chief Inspector looks for a reaction but gets none
from Broughton.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
This has caused a great deal of
tension between East and West.

BROUGHTON
How can I help you, Inspector?

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
First Chief Inspector, Ms. Lloyd.
We are told the Stasi officer was
trying to defect.

BROUGHTON
There are sixteen million East
Germans that to want to defect.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
Two Russian nationals were also
killed.

BROUGHTON
Why are you telling me this?

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
Witnesses say that there was a
woman aiding the Stasi officer. A
woman that fits your general
likeness.

The First Chief Inspector stares at Broughton.

BROUGHTON
I don’t believe you have any
evidence.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
What makes you so sure?

BROUGHTON
Because if you did, I would be in
your jail by now.

The First Chief Inspector takes a step closer.
FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
The Britisher who was shot last

week was a spy, wasn’t he?

BROUGHTON
How would I know?
86.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
Your government sends you to
replace him and stage a Stasi
officer's defection.

BROUGHTON
I have no idea what you are talking
about. I am a British civil
servant, a lawyer.

The First Chief Inspector takes another step, closing the
distance to Broughton’s face. Broughton remains stoic under
the tension in the room.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
Where were you yesterday afternoon?

BROUGHTON
LASALLE
++. was with me.

The First Chief Inspector turns to Lasalle standing in the
hotel room doorway.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
There are plenty of my friends who
will confirm this.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR
No doubt.

The polizei brush past Lasalle. The First Chief Inspector
strides towards the door and then turns back to Broughton.

FIRST CHIEF INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
I‘11l will question each and every
one of them thoroughly.

The polizei are gone. Lasalle looks at Broughton.

BROUGHTON

You didn’t have to do that.
LASALLE

When I didn’t hear from you, I got

worried.

Broughton moves towards her clothes that hang in the closet
as she lowers her towel. Lasalle looks across at her naked
frame. We see deep bruises covering Broughton’s body from the
punishing staircase fight and car crash. Broughton pulls on
her clothes.
87.

LASALLE (CONT'D)
I fear you are in danger.

Broughton grabs her coat.
BROUGHTON
We’re all in danger here. You
should pack and run back to Paris.

Broughton pulls on her coat and moves towards the door.

LASALLE
What for?

BROUGHTON
You'll be dead if you don’t. Now
excuse me.

Broughton moves past Lasalle, and the hotel room door closes.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - MI6 SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Broughton walks off the street and up the stairs to a drab
apartment building.

INT. WEST BERLIN - MI6 SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Perceval looks through the peephole and opens the door for
Broughton.

PERCEVAL
You look like shit.

Broughton says nothing and enters the room.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)

You okay?
BROUGHTON
Spyglass didn’t make it.
PERCEVAL
I know... Welcome to Berlin.

Broughton starts to take her coat off.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Leave it on. The Americans want to
talk to us.

BROUGHTON
Have you told his family?
88.

PERCEVAL
Not yet. I was waiting to see if
you even made it.

Broughton takes a breath.

BROUGHTON
I'll do it. Give me a few minutes
alone with them. I made a promise.

Perceval steps aside, and Broughton moves towards a small
bedroom door. She knocks gently and then slowly opens the
door. Spyglass’s wife and daughter sit on a twin bed and
stare up at her framed perfectly in the doorway.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
I am so sorry.

Helena pulls her daughter into her arms and cries out in
grief. Broughton shuts the bedroom door and keeps her promise
to Spyglass.

EXT. TIERGARDEN PARK - DAY

Perceval, Kurzfeld and Broughton stand near the frozen duck
pond in the harsh light of the afternoon.

KURZFELD
I expected more out of the Brits
than a royal goat fuck!

PERCEVAL
Maybe you should've backed us up!

KURZFELD
We would've if we had known you
were crossing him over.

BROUGHTON
You don’t have our own Stasi
agent... do you?
KURZFELD
Not one with a photographic memory.
Goddamn it... So, who was blown?
PERCEVAL
Not us... The KGB knew the EXFIL

route and the best hide position
for effective fire.
89.

KURZFELD
That doesn’t guarantee who gave the
sniper his orders.

BROUGHTON
Could it have been Satchel?

They all look at one another for a moment knowing they don’t
have an answer to that question.

KURZFELD
Well maybe the dead drop was
compromised?

PERCEVAL
No... only myself and Gascione ever
knew its location.
Perceval turns towards Broughton.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
What about your fixer, Merkel?

BROUGHTON
If I weren’t for him, I’d have
never made it back.

PERCEVAL
Well, you never know whom to trust.

Perceval looks at Broughton.
BROUGHTON
That's right. Trust does seem to be
in short supply these days.

Broughton holds Perceval’s eyes for a moment.

KURZFELD

Could you've been the target?
BROUGHTON

Me?
KURZFELD

That Spyglass was just collateral?

BROUGHTON
If the sniper wanted to shoot me
first, he could have.

KURZFELD
Mighty convenient that they didn’t.
90.

Broughton takes a step towards the remark.

BROUGHTON
What are you implying?

Perceval steps between them.

PERCEVAL
Be serious, Emmett. This was
obviously about silencing Spyglass
before we got to him. He must have
been blown.

BROUGHTON
Well, whoever the target was,
Moscow has sent us a message.

Kurzfeld leans towards Broughton and points his finger.

KURZFELD
Langley is going to hang my ass in
the wind for this.

PERCEVAL
I’m sure they're waiting for you to
file your report. I know London's
waiting on me.

Kurzfeld walks away in disgust and doesn’t look back.
KURZFELD
Let’s all just concentrate on
keeping our heads down.
Perceval turns to Broughton.
PERCEVAL
It’s all cocked up, but I think he
still likes us.

They stand for a moment in silence.

BROUGHTON
I don’t know what to say.

PERCEVAL
I‘1l work on a flight for you. C’s
going to want whatever your side of
this mess is in triplicate.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

SUPER: “NOVEMBER 9, 1989”
gl.

Broughton stares out the window at the gray evening sky. A
half-empty bottle of Stoli sits next to her.

We hear the PHONE RING.
Broughton picks it up and speaks.

BROUGHTON
Lloyd.

INT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

Lasalle stands in her bedroom in La Perla with the telephone
pressed to her ear.

LASALLE
Dinner?

BROUGHTON (V.O.)
I don’t think it’s the best idea.

LASALLE
A drink then?

BROUGHTON (V.O.)
You're persistent.

Lasalle chamber checks her pistol, confirms it is loaded, and
slides it beneath the pillow on her bed.

LASALLE
Another of my charms. I’ve a recipe
of great interest to you.

BROUGHTON (V.0.)
What might that be?

LASALLE
It’s sweet as sugar. It has to do
with Perceval.

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

Broughton takes a sip of her Stoli and looks out around her
empty hotel room.

BROUGHTON
All right, I'll be by later
tonight.

Broughton sets the phone down, looks out the window, and then
dials another number immediately.
92.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Are you busy?

PERCEVAL (V.O.)
Writing up a report for my old
friend, "C.”

BROUGHTON
There are some legal issues with
the transportation I’d like to ask
you about.

PERCEVAL (V.O.)
Come by anytime.

BROUGHTON
I'll get a cab and be right over.

Broughton hangs up the phone.

EXT. WEST BERLIN - NIGHT

Broughton steps from a cab and walks up to Perceval’s
building.

INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Broughton walks through the office door and leaves her coat
on this time. Perceval and Broughton are civil, however they

is a cat and mouse tension to the room.

PERCEVAL
You look polished.

BROUGHTON
I’m saying goodbye to Lasalle.

PERCEVAL
Lucky lady... Scotch?

BROUGHTON
Sure.

Perceval moves across to his desk and lifts a bottle.
PERCEVAL
There aren’t any transportation
issues. So, what do you really want
to talk about?

Perceval sets two glasses out and lifts the bottle.
93.

BROUGHTON
Failure.

PERCEVAL
Are you worried about how this
looks in your file? How you’1l
advance up the ladder at The
Circus?

BROUGHTON
I really hadn’t thought that far.

Perceval pours three fingers of a single malt and hands it
across to Broughton.

PERCEVAL
Well, don’t.

BROUGHTON
Is that your official
recommendation?

PERCEVAL
You've never lost a package before?

BROUGHTON
I've buried friends... enemies...
and I’ve buried my emotions for a
great many years... and with that,
I’ve come to the conclusion that
it simply doesn’t matter.

Perceval offers Broughton a seat in one of the two worn-
leather club chairs. Perceval lifts his highball towards
Broughton. They both take a silent, smooth drink.

PERCEVAL
There was a lovely Italian girl who
once told me, “David, you can’t
unfuck what has been fucked.”

Perceval smiles and leans in, serious and measured.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Listen carefully. At the end of a
very long career of chasing
shadows, the only reward you take
home is to grow old. If you’re
lucky, you tell some good lies to
the boys down at the pub.

BROUGHTON
I believed somehow the truth would
lay out differently.
94.

PERCEVAL
There is that beautiful word.
Truth.

BROUGHTON

We’re in the enterprise of
reshaping the truth to serve
England. After all, there is no way
around the datum that at times our
job comes down to kill or be
killed.

Perceval pauses for a moment and then, upon reflection --

PERCEVAL
The blood on our hands will wash
away with time.

BROUGHTON
That’s it... just let it go?

PERCEVAL
Unless you want it to eat a hole
straight through your guts. It’s
simple. Somewhere, somebody got the
upper hand. Maybe you were too
conspicuous when you went over to
see Merkel.

BROUGHTON
Wait a damn minute.

PERCEVAL
Or maybe I was indiscreet when I
picked up Spyglass’s message. As I
already said, most likely, Spyglass
himself was the loudmouth. The
truth is we will never know.

BROUGHTON
And the body I found in the tunnel?
PERCEVAL
I told you those tunnels are
history.
BROUGHTON

It was Bakhtin.
Perceval takes a drink.

PERCEVAL
Did he have the list?
95.

BROUGHTON
No.

PERCEVAL
Who the hell knows how Bakhtin
ended up there? Anyone, even
Bremoyvch could have killed him.

BROUGHTON
I suppose you’re right.

Perceval sets his empty glass down on the side table.

PERCEVAL
I am right, and you’re damn
fortunate to make it back to fight
another day.

Broughton holds up the UHF device and hard wire and hands it
to Perceval. His smile fades.

BROUGHTON
It’s French made for the DSGE. I
found it in hidden in my coat.

PERCEVAL
Never trust the Frenchies.

Broughton nods and moves towards the front door followed by
Perceval.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Can I give you a lift to Lasalle’s
place.

BROUGHTON
No, I am going to walk. The fresh
air helps me think.

Perceval opens the door for Broughton as she steps out into
the hallway.

PERCEVAL
You're a hell of a good officer.
Now... forget I ever said that.

Broughton nods and continues on without ever looking back.
Perceval closes the door. He looks at the UHF device and hard
wire on the table and then grabs the keys to his Saab.

INT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We see a window of the apartment slide open. Cold air gently
blows the curtains. Lasalle listens to a Sony Walkman through
headphones as she pours a drink for herself in her bedroom
and sets the bottle down.

We reveal an INTRUDER wearing a ski mask standing behind her.
Lasalle is completely unaware until the electrical cord pulls
tight around her neck.

Lasalle struggles to free herself. She throws the Intruder

off of her and scrambles, gasping for air, towards the bed.
The Intruder lunges after Lasalle as she crawls up the bed,
reaching for the pillow, her concealed gun just inches away.

We hear the downstairs BUZZER of the building.

The Intruder climbs on Lasalle’s back, grabs the cord and
pulls it tight around her neck. Lasalle’s hand is on the gun,
but she doesn’t have the strength to lift it into her palm.

EXT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A young couple leaves Lasalle’s building. Broughton slips
through the open front door and moves down the hallway.

INT. LASALLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lasalle twists around and claws the ski mask off the
Intruder. We reveal: Perceval as he pulls back on the cord,
and the life fades from her eyes.

Lasalle’s body falls to the floor. Perceval moves off of
Lasalle’s dead body and begins to search through the
apartment.

We hear a KNOCK on the door.

Perceval is out of time. He turns and climbs out the open
window as Lasalle’s front door is pushed open by Broughton.

Broughton enters and finds Lasalle’s strangled, warm body on
the floor. She moves through the apartment, sees the open
window, and looks outside. Nothing.

Broughton moves back through the apartment and stops at the
bathroom. She looks in and sees it has been converted to a
small photo darkroom with a red blub. A clothesline hangs
above the develop, fix, and stop trays. We see there are
several photos of Broughton that reveal Lasalle’s fixation.
97.
Broughton closes the door and moves back into the kitchen We
see large glass containers of FLOUR, SALT... and SUGAR.
Broughton turns over the container, dumping the sugar onto
the counter along with a package. Broughton opens the package
to reveal a stack of photos.
INSERT - PHOTOS
Photo 1 - Perceval and Bremovych talking in a club.
Photo 2 - Perceval talking to the KGB Sniper, Ivan Yerchenko.
Photo 3 - KGB Agent Bakhtin handing Perceval an envelope.
Photo 4 - Perceval opening the envelope.
Photo 5 - Gascione’s Burcherer timepiece in Perceval’s hand.
Photo 6 - Perceval standing over Bakhtin’s dead body.
BACK TO SCENE
Broughton takes the photos and moves out of the apartment,
never looking back at Lasalle’s body on the floor.
EXT. BERLIN - FRENCH SECTOR - NIGHT
Broughton exits Lasalle’s apartment building and moves into
the neighborhood. On the street, a sedan pulls out and
follows her. Broughton can sense the sedan’s headlights and
picks up her pace towards a busy intersection ahead.
Broughton stops at a small newspaper stand and glances toward
the street and the approaching sedan. She can now see
Bremovych and his driver clearly in the sedan driving towards
her. She calmly turns and walks around the corner just as the
light turns red.
Bremovych’s sedan pulls up just six feet away. Steady now...
Broughton looks across the six busy lanes of traffic to the

hotel’s taxi stand.

Out of the corner of her eye, she watches Bremovych. Then,
the sedan’s window starts to roll down.

Against the red light, Broughton bolts out into the fray of
speeding cars and cuts through the screeching traffic.

We hear HORNS HONKING and SHEET METAL SMASHING.

Cars slide and pile up in the intersection. Broughton escapes
without a scratch.
98.

She sprints onto the median, across the next three lanes, and
jumps into the waiting taxi. Broughton looks across at the
wrecks of a dozen cars. Bremovych stands next to his sedan
and watches her escape him once more.

INT. ATTACHE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is lit by a single bare bulb and a small television.
Perceval sits alone, drinking two fingers of single-malt
scotch.

INSERT - NEWS FOOTAGE

MTV's Kurt Loder reports from the Berlin Wall. We see from
the MTV news footage that massive crowds are assembling. Two
EAST GERMAN SOLDIERS stand on the Wall, holding an MTV
umbrella. An iconic symbol of the times.

We MOVE ON the television, and we see the reflection of
Perceval. He leans in and shuts of the TV.

Perceval swings a small duffle bag over his shoulder and
kicks over a Jerry can. The gasoline pours out onto the
hardwood floor of his apartment.

Perceval stands at his front door, lights a match and throws
it onto the floor. The whole room is consumed in flames.
Perceval moves on.

EXT. PERCEVAL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Perceval steps out of his building. We see the flames and
smoke coming from his apartment window. Perceval walks
parallel to the graffiti-covered Wall and then cuts into the
alleyway towards his Saab 900 Turbo.

A FIGURE steps towards him in the dark alley, and Perceval
slows his steps as he approaches his car.

PERCEVAL
Well, I suppose that’s it. We’ll be
obsolete by morning. I’1l be back
in London, and you... back to the
party.

We hear the faint sounds of HAMMERS STRIKING against
concrete.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
The simplicity of our struggle
crumbles as that wall comes down.
(MORE )
99.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
The lines on the map drawn by men
who never faced the risk themselves
will be harder to see.

In the distance, the CROWDS’ CHEERS are heard.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
A different world is approaching.
More volatile. More corrupt. There
will be no ideologies to protect
us. Just the brutal and cold
conscience of commerce.

Perceval eyes follow a group of West Germans with hand tools
moving towards the Wall.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Extortion... Whoever has the list
in this new world has all power.
Without it? Just a target.

Perceval turns back to the wordless figure in the shadows.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
We played our hands. Hell, I’m just
glad to see your face at this
moment, as the ramparts of tyranny
fall into the history books.

Perceval smiles softly to himself as he looks towards the
crowds.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Listen to them.

In the faint light, we see the flash of gunmetal.
We hear a GUNSHOT BARK out! BAAAM BAAAM BAAAM!

Perceval’s body falls to the cold alleyway. Broughton steps
from the shadows and stands with the smoke twisting from the
barrel.

BROUGHTON
Lasalle was harmless?

PERCEVAL
No one is harmless. Lasalle was
extorting me.

BROUGHTON
And the list?
100.

PERCEVAL
You're too late. Bremovych paid me
handsomely.

Perceval coughs up a mouthful of blood and stares up at
Broughton holding her gun in his face. She reaches down and
removes the “ Carl F Bucherer “ timepiece from his wrist.

BROUGHTON
You going to play out the lies
until the bitter end?

Perceval’s eyes struggle to focus on Broughton’s face and
then, when they do, he softly grunts:

PERCEVAL
Would you believe Queen and
country?

BROUGHTON

Yes, Comrade Satchel.

PERCEVAL
That’s how you’re going to play it?

Broughton says nothing.

PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
Well done... Well done.

The pool of blood grows around Perceval’s body, and he
relaxes in death.

EXT. ENGLAND - FARNBOROUGH AIRPORT - DAY

SUPER: “NOVEMBER 11, 1989”

It’s raining in England. It’s always raining. A Royal Air
Force C-130 Hercules aircraft parks on the hardstand. The
giant props slow to a stop as the rear ramp extends down.
Broughton exits the front of the aircraft.

We hear the SOUND of a lone BAGPIPER.

Broughton turns and watches the Royal Scots Honor Guard exit
down the ramp of the C-130 with two flag-draped coffins, the

bodies Gascione and Perceval.

Broughton stands in silence as the coffins are loaded for
ground transport.
101.

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY

The ashtray is full of Woodbines. The Nagra III reel to reel
records on the table. Gray leans forward and then exclaims:

GRAY
What happened?

Broughton sits in silence for a moment.

BROUGHTON
I failed, sir.

GRAY

Your directive was to bring home
one body, and you return with two.
You were tasked to find the most
important list of the last forty
years of the Cold War, you come
back empty-handed. You’re a bloody
disgrace!

Broughton leans across the desk. She has had enough.

BROUGHTON
You sent me into a hornet’s nest.
From the moment I touched down, the
KGB was on to me. You knew Perceval
was on the bubble and he knew not
to trust me. You wanted Satchel?
Well here he is.

Broughton sets down a manila folder.

Gray looks through a stack of black-and-white photos from
Lasalle’s apartment. Gray lifts a black-and-white photo and
shows it to Kurzfeld.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
These photos are damning evidence
of Perceval’s involvement with the
KGB. Perceval was Satchel.

Gray and Kurzfeld looks across at Broughton.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Three days after Gascione was
killed, Bremovych arrives in
Berlin. Why? Because Gascione was
onto Perceval and he was going to
reveal him as the double.
102.

KURZFELD
So Bremovych has Gascione killed to
cover for Perceval.

Broughton points to the photo of Perceval and Bakhtin.

BROUGHTON
And once you sent me to West
Berlin. Perceval was covering his
tracks.

KURZFELD
The sniper team was meant for you
after all.

BROUGHTON
I think so. I found a French made
UHF device in my coat after
Spyglass was killed. I now believe
Perceval planted it and made it
look like Lasalle.

FLASH CUT:

INT. WEST BERLIN - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Broughton sits at the desk in front of the Narga SN mirco
recording device. A stack of recorded reel and reel tapes sit
next to her. With great precision, Broughton methodically
edits sections of tape together from different recorded
conversations.

BACK TO:

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO-FAC - DAY
Broughton turns to Gray.

BROUGHTON
Sir, you told me to “trust know
one”. In case you need anymore
evidence against Perceval.

Broughton pulls out the Narga SN from her purse and sets it
on the desk.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
Here is a recording of Bremovych
and Perceval.

Broughton leans forward and CLICKS on the Narga SN and the
mirco reels begin to play her masterfully edited tape.
103.

We follow the dialogue back to each scene:

FLASHCUT TO:

EXT. WEST BERLIN - WALL - DAY
Perceval walks with Broughton. Two US ARMY jeeps with
SOLDIERS from the 2nd Battalion 6th Infantry patrol past.
Perceval gestures towards the Brandenburg Gate.
PERCEVAL

Look... if you’re going to be here

for awhile, we had better play nice

with one another.

FLASHCUT TO:

EXT. PERCEVAL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Perceval is in the alleyway next to his Saab 900 turbo.
PERCEVAL
Whoever has the list in this new
world has all the power.

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. PALM RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Bremovych stands along the Art Deco bar next to Broughton and
Lasalle.

BREMOVYCH
Maybe we could make some sort of
arrangement?

FLASHCUT TO:

EXT. WEST BERLIN - NIGHT

We see the bombarded ruins of the Kasier Whelm Memorial
Church. Perceval stands next to Broughton.

PERCEVAL
Deal.

FLASHCUT TO:
104.

INT. PALM RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Bremovych stands turns to Broughton at the bar.

BREMOVYCH
What about the British?

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. PERCEVAL’S SAAB - NIGHT
Perceval stares to Broughton in the parked car.

PERCEVAL
c is an arrogant lapdog and doesn’t
know fuck all about the world past
the edge of his desk!

FLASHCUT TO:

INT. CENTURY HOUSE - ISO FAC - DAY

Broughton stares at the mirror of the wall and then at the
two veterans of the Cold War. She calmly leans over and
CLICKS off the Narga SN and the mirco reels fall silent.

BROUGHTON
Do you need to hear more?

Gray looks at Kurzfeld and leans over, CLICKS his NAGRA reel
to reel. The tape stops for the first time in hours.

GRAY
We are choosing to bury this one,
Broughton. Your mission never took
place. This conversation and the
one that Emmett and I are about to
have with C never happened.

Broughton sits in silence.

GRAY (CONT’D)
I’m putting you on leave, effective
immediately. Come back fresh in the
new year. We’ll start the next
decade well-rested.

Gray and Kurzfeld stand and exit the room. Broughton sits in
the bare light. She slowly lights her last Woodbine and
exhales.
105.

EXT. NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND - AIRPORT

SUPER: “DECEMBER 1, 1989”

A gorgeous blonde steps from a Newcastle taxicab and walks
into the airport. It’s Lorraine Broughton. She carries no
bags. She walks through security and boards an international
flight.

EXT. LONDON - DAY

Cc and Gray stroll along the Thames River under a late
afternoon sky.

Cc
Thatcher is going to have a
difficult time with this.

GRAY
It’s never good when one of our own
stumbles.

Cc nods and squints towards the Palace of Westminster.

INT./EXT. PAN AM FLIGHT - DAY
On the descent, Broughton looks out the window.

Cc (V.0.)
Did we ever find the watchmaker?

FLASH CUT:

EXT. WEST BERLIN- WATCH REPAIR SHOP.

We slowly move into the shop window and reveal the watch
repair shop is completely empty.

GRAY (V.O.)
We sent a team to the address

Broughton gave us. It was clean,
nothing but an empty store front.

BACK TO:

EXT. PARIS - CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

Broughton steps up to a waiting taxi and climbs into the
backseat without hesitation. The taxi pulls out and drives
towards the city of Paris.
106.

INT. FRENCH TAXI - EVENING

Broughton is being driven through the City of Lights. The
blonde wig is gone, and she’s wearing a new set of clothes.
She looks through a small Hermés Kelly bag. Broughton exits
the taxi and turns into the early evening.

EXT. LONDON - DUSK

The sun is nearly gone. Gray and C move their walk off the
banks of the Thames and up to the Victoria Embankment.

Cc
We'll have to promote Broughton
just to keep her quiet.

GRAY
Yes, sir.

EXT. PARIS - L’HOTEL RITZ - NIGHT

Broughton walks across the Place Vendome. The RITZ DOORMAN
greets her as she enters the lobby.

INT. PARIS - L’HOTEL RITZ - LOBBY/ELEVATORS - NIGHT

Broughton moves through the grand lobby, passes the Bar
Vendome and stops at the front desk. We don’t hear the
conversation. Broughton smiles as she is handed the room key
and moves to the elevators at the end of a gilded hallway.

EXT. LONDON - NIGHT

Gray and C stand outside the black door of Number 10 Downing
street.

GRAY
It’s still hard to imagine David
Perceval and Satchel were the same
person.

Cc
I never really trusted him.
INT. PARIS - L’HOTEL RITZ - NIGHT

Broughton walks down the hallway to the door of her suite.
She enters and takes off her coat.
A titan of man sits on the couch with his back to her.

stands and turns to reveal: Bremovych.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
Comrade Satchel.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
Comrade Bremovych.

Broughton moves toward Bremovych, and they embrace.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
I am pleased you choose to meet in
Paris before we return home.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
I ordered room service from the
concierge.

Broughton leans in and kisses her counterpart.

BROUGHTON (CONT’D)
(in Russian)
I could've done without being shot
at in East Berlin with Spyglass.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
The West has made you soft with
ideas of individualism, comrade.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
My hope is Moscow and the party
will be pleased.

107.

He

We hear a KNOCK at the hotel suite door. Broughton walks to
the door, and a ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT enters with a rolling
cart and bottles of Dom Perignon and Stoli sitting in silver

buckets of ice.
Bremovych signs for the bill and tips the attendant.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
Merci. Bon nuit, Monsieur.

The Attendant turns to Broughton.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
Mademoiselle.
108.

Only in this moment do we sense something familiar about him
-- he turns and leaves without another word spoken.

Bremovych lifts the Dom Perignon from the ice.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
1961. Very appropriate.

Broughton moves to him, takes the bottle of Dom from his
hands and sets it back into the ice.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
Let’s start with the vodka.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
A good Russian woman.

Broughton lifts the bottle of Stoli from the second bucket
and pours two glasses of vodka.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
That you’ve been ordered to kill,
haven’t you?

Bremovych doesn’t react and deflects her question.

BREMOVYCH
(in Russian)
Lasalle, Gascione and Perceval they
were all worthy enemies.

Broughton holds up her wrist and reveals the “Carl F
Bucherer” timepiece.

BREMOVYCH (CONT’D)
(in Russian)
They may have won the battle for
Berlin, but this... will let us win
the Cold War.

BROUGHTON
(in Russian)
Let's enjoy the night.

Broughton hands Bremovych his vodka.
BREMOVYCH

(in Russian)
For the memories, Comrade Satchel.
109.

Bremovych and Broughton looks at the vodka and then empty the
glass. A shared moment of accomplishment between two warriors
in the Parisian hotel suite.

Broughton moves to the vodka bottle. Bremovych reaches to the
small of his back and his strong hand makes contact with a
weapon.

With one swift movement, Broughton draws a suppressed handgun
out of the ice and double taps the trigger before Bremovych
can react. The two bullets punch through Bremovych’s cranial
stem and kill him instantly.

BROUGHTON
(in English)
For the memories, Comrade
Bremovych.

The Room Service Attendant appears from the hallway. This is
Merkel from East Berlin. He is followed by a cleaning team
that moves into the suite, lifts Bremovych into a body bag,
and begins to sterilize everything. Merkel looks at
Broughton.

MERKEL
He’s waiting.

Broughton walks out of the suite and never looks back.

EXT. PARIS - NIGHT

Broughton walks out of a side door of the L’Hotel Ritz. We
follow her several blocks as she cuts through the Jardin des
Tuileries and along the Place de la Concorde. She descends
the stone stairs to a small motor boat waiting on the Seine.

EXT. PARIS - MOTOR BOAT - NIGHT
A DECKHAND unties the boat and throws the line ashore.

We hear the BOAT’S ENGINE cry out in the cold air.

Broughton walks past the closed cockpit. At the controls of
the small motor boat:

We see the Watchmaker. He touches the brim of his faded New
York Yankees baseball cap as he recognizes Broughton. Not a
word is spoken between them. Broughton moves towards the bow
of the boat. We hear a voice call out:
110.

KURZFELD
Our team is clear of the Ritz and
already at our Embassy.

Emmett Kurzfeld steps forward.

BROUGHTON
Perceval was never going to defect?

KURZFELD
Unknown. I planted that story to
safeguard you.

BROUGHTON
I don’t feel good about that.

KURZFELD
I've been where you are right now,
where everything and everyone I got
close to ended up dead.

They share a moment of silence. Broughton sits down on a
small bench seat against the cabin.

BROUGHTON
I am tired, sir.

KURZFELD
How many years have you given for
this night?

BROUGHTON
More than I would have liked.

Broughton hands Kurzfeld the “ Carl F Burcherer “” timepiece.
Kurzfeld pries open the back plate, and within it is a secret
chamber: We see the encrypted list with the name of every
Cold War intelligence officer.

KURZFELD
It’s time you come home, Karen.

Broughton smiles at the sound of her true given name.
BROUGHTON
I’m ready, sir. I have had enough
of the cold.

PRE-LAP on the soundtrack: “Home Sweet Home” by Motley Crew.

On the boat’s prow, a defiant AMERICAN FLAG SNAPS in the
wind. Broughton and her American counter-intelligence team
speed past the Eiffel Tower under a starless night.

SLAM TO BLACK.
