SOUTHERN COMFORT

FADE IN:
BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA
EXT. ARMORY NIGHT

Warehouse district, near the river...

A statue of a Confederate soldier stands in the shadows,
his rifle held high and proud. Beyond, a Civil War cannon
points out from the darkness.

HEADLIGHTS

bright and blinding from down the street, they pass over the
statue and find a sign: "Louisiana National Guard"...The
ear slowly glides into the Armory parking lot.

ANOTHER SEI OF HEADLIGHTS

as a pick-up truck down-shifts. From the opposite end of
the street another vehicle approaches, followed by more
headlights...and more headlights...and more again.

cur TO:

INT. ARMORY NIGHT

Two basketball hoops. Framed photos of Generals and military
leaders. An American flag.crossed with the state banner of
Louisiana...Spelled out in bold letters across the far wall,
"This is the Home of the. Best Infantry Company in the World."

ONE HUNDRED NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

Some sit or lie on the cement, others lean: against the brick
wall, still others fueling up on coffee and donuts. U.S,
Army fatigues everywhere; boots, bayonets, buttpacks, ammo
pouches, canteens hanging from pistol belts, steel pot helmets
with camouflage nets...

Grudgingly, the men start to assemble, picking up their
duffle bags and forming lines. Again the whistle blows.

FIRST SERGEANT
Come on, fall in!

ROLL CALL FORMATION

Four platoons, 110 men standing alongside their duffles.
The First Sergeant moves before them and begins shouting
names from a clipboard. Each man answers with a half-
hearted "yeah" or "yo".

FIRST SERGEANT
Marian...Masterson\..Mayhew...
Maxvill...Meadows...Merritt...
Middlebrook...

These are the weekend warriors. Some having signed on
years ago to duck the draft, some of them just like being
in the club, the others. in for the money each month and
the prospect of a pension.

CAPTAIN
Take your post, Sergeant.

CAPTAIN UNDERWOOD

Late forties. Lean and mean. Hair cut yesterday. Boots
glistening, fatigues starched. His voice crisp, sharp.
Complete command.

CAPTAIN
At ease.

The Company relaxes. Men shift weight, scratch.

, CAPTAIN
Platoon sergeants. After your
men draw their weapons you'll be
in the trucks ready to move out

some battalion brass will be coming
down to observe you people...Please

he notices a lone figure slowly making his way across the
Armory.

WILSON
Here he is, pride of the regiment.

All eyes target on:

RIFLEMAN TERRANCE LEE ATWATER - SPECIALIST 4TH CLASS

handsome, with the look of youth that comes from living
the soft life. His hair flops over his forehead,. covering
a portion of his glasses. His boots need a shine, his
uniform a pressing. Not a sad sack, but he is spoiled
Southern. His steel helmet is tied to the duffle bag

and clangs out as he drags it across the cement floor.

As he passes the Captain, Atwater casually flicks a
salute in the officer's general direction.

ATWATER
Captain.

CAPTAIN
You're late, soldier.

To the snickering of the men and the stare of the Captain,
Atwater joins Ist ‘Squad, 2nd Platoon. Stands in line next
to Wilson.

ATWATER
Did I miss sick call?

RIFLEMAN VICTOR CALVELLI - SPECIALIST 4TH CLASS

standing next to Wilson on the other side. -Wears a wedding
ring. Thirty years old. A Chemical Engineer transferred
down from New Jersey two months ago by Texaco. Not too
thrilled about being here.

the others lying on the floor among their duffle bags and
rifles...outside a young Lieutenant passes by, decides to
look in for a regulation growl.

LIEUTENANT
You men comfortable?
MEN
Yes sir!
LIEUTENANT

 

Can't hear you!
They roar back.

MEN

LIEUTENANT

The Lieutenant moves briskly on.

THE CONVOY MOVING OUT - IN DARKNESS

A roaring line of Jeeps and trucks snorting black exhaust;
headlights sweeping past the Armory.

INIT. REAR OF TRUCK

The last vehicle of the ten truck convoy shelters the men
of the 2nd platoon; 40 of them taking the bumps, settling
down, trying either to get comfortable or, even a better
idea, to get some sleep.

RIFLEMAN EARL LONGBRAKE - SPECIALIST 4TH CLASS

Big and solid. Red of neck. Likes a good time. Nineteen
years old. He pulls a six pack of Dixie beer out of his
duffle bag and offers it around after popping one open

for himself.

LONGBRAKE
Anybody for a brew?

His pal Masterson makes the automatic reach. As does
Atwater.

ATWATER
Hair of the dog.

RIFLEMAN LONNIE MASTERSON - SPECIALIST 5TH CLASS

Late 20's. Works in the oil fields. Completed his three
years regular Army and is in the Guard because he likes
it. Drives a pick-up, wears a drooping moustache and
sideburns...A life model for Longbrake.

Don't ask me. Hey Masterson, why
in Christ are they taking us to

MASTERSON

The convoy rolls through the suburbs of Baton Rouge; all
quiet among the rows of houses beyond the rumbling column of
khaki colored vehicles.

CUT TO:

INT. REAR OF TRUCK DAWN

Most of the 2nd Platoon now sound asleep, oblivious to the '
first rays of sunlight. A slow stretching move by one of '
the uniformed men...

RIFLEMAN NOLAN YOUNGBLOOD - SPECIALIST 4TH CLASS

Biggest of them all. And all of it's muscle. Teaches ninth

grade history and is also the varsity line coach at Lafayette

Union High School. He's not one to be taken lightly...

Unfortunately he doesn't take himself lightly either, seeing
cl himself as a scholar-athlete and is clearly a man who loves
the sound of his own voice.

YOUNGBLOOD
Trust you brought your portable
air conditioner, Atwater.

ATWATER
And refrigerator.

WILSON
Atwater's the only man in the
history of the Guard that brings
satin sheets to summer camp.

MASTERSON
What you all doin' in the truck
with us anyway, Atwater? Why
ain't you ridin' down on a polo
pony?

ATWATER
Listen, my polo pony wouldn't
associate with you guys.

the bullshit.

THE CONVOY

Now moving along the Interstate highway. Morning breaking
on a sharp, clear day...it's going to be a hot one...A
little girl at a Gas Station waves as the trucks pass. The
Guardsmen give her the finger.

CUT TO:

INT. TRUCK CAB DAWN

Three men, Squad Leader Taylor, next to him a Sergeant from
the 2nd Squad and...

SQUAD LEADER CLAUDE NORMAN - SPECIALIST, E-5

Behind the wheel. His sleeves are pushed up and his right
forearm has a tatoo of a pirate skull. He dropped out of
high school to join the Army and fight in Nam, but they

stopped the war. Pissed him off. Still has ideas though.

' Lives alone, keeps two cats. Subscribes to "Soldier of

Fortune",

SQUAD LEADER CRAWFORD TAYLOR - SPECIALIST 6TH CLASS

Two tours in Viet Nam. Decorated. Knows how to play the
game. Going for his twenty year pension, already has nine
in...The men of the 2nd Platoon all respect him; a good man
to have on your side.

TAYLOR
They want combat soldiers, Norman.
Not typists.

EXT. CONVOY

The trucks are moving laboriously down a four lane highway.
In the distance an isolated shopping center site stands half
constructed.

INT. REAR OF TRUCK MORNING

Longbrake looks across at the half-asleep Wilson.

LONGBRAKE
Hey, Clitoris.

Wilson cuts him off cold.

WILSON
Cleotis.

LONGBRAKE
Yeah. When we get down in them
swamps, be sure you watch out
for those snakes.

WILSON
I'll watch for them. I just
don't want them watchin' for me.

CALVELLI

Someone has finally said something that interests him...or
at least something that he thinks he ought to know about.

CALVELLI
What kind of snakes?

GUARDSMAN
Moccasins. Copperheads.

LONGBRAKE
One a them bites you, you bend
over, stick your head between
your knees and kiss your ass
goodbye.

MASTERS ON

quietly reaches into his pocket and pulls out a box of 5-56
ammunition. Without drawing attention from the others,
snaps a shell into the chamber of his M-16.

. GUARDSMAN
When I was training in Fort Benning,
our instructor got bit right here by
a coral snake.

He extends his right arm.
GUARDSMAN
He put his hand on a log, took
his machette, and cut his hand
right off, I swear to God.
Groans and smiles; nobody believes him.

CONT INUED.: SATURDAY MORNING
Masterson leans out over the tailgate of the truck, levels
his M-16 at the approaching supermarket construction site
and sends a bullet into a huge plate glass window, a quarter
of a mile beyond.
SUPERMARKET

The window shatters and falls.

INT. REAR OF TRUCK

A proud smile shines out from under Masterson's moustache;
some of the boys think this is the funniest thing they've
ever seen.

MASTERSON
I ain't worried about snakes.

He reaches into his shirt and displays the box of live
ammunition.

LONGBRAKE
Shit, you sonofabitch. Why
didn't you tell me you brought
real ammo?

A violent sway from the lurching vehicle.

EXT. HIGHWAY

The truck pulling over hard to the right, onto the shoulder
of the road.

INT. REAR OF TRUCK -

Braking sounds from the heavy vehicle...The small window
separating the truck bed from the cab is snapped open.

NORMAN
Allright, what the fuck was that?

Yeah? '
LONGBRAKE |

Fuck you. |
MASTERS ON

Why don't you get these sons of
bitches tuned up, Norman. |

Taylor's head appears at the window.
TAYLOR
Whatever the hell's going on
back there, knock it off...

The Guardsmen go quiet. A long moment.

TAYLOR '
Okay, Norman let's go.

The window again snaps up...a moment later the truck lurches
into gear.
MASTERSON

Wide smile. He got away with it.

CALVELLI

His stoical expression doesn't quite mask his contempt.
Atwater is the only one quick enough to notice. He grins
across to Calvelli.

ATWATER
Yeah, we ain't smart, but we
sure have fun.

EXT, SMALL TOWN EARLY MORNING

The Convoy leisurely moving down the business section; a
shopkeeper is opening his General Store as the trucks roll
past...the Old Man gets pelted with empty beer cans.

cur TO:

INT. TRUCK - THE MEN

Knocked out, sweaty, quiet as they bounce along. Then,
finally, the truck grinds to a slow halt.

SMITH
We stopped.

WILSON
You're right up there with the
latest news, aren't ya.

Outside the truck a raspy male voice penetrates the morning
air.

VOICE
Alright! Let's go in there!
Outta the truck!

Slowly the men start dropping out over the tailgate. They
fall and trip, getting hit with helmets, rifles, duffle bags.
THE 1ST SQUAD, SECOND PLATOON

Atwater, Calvelli, Youngblood, Smith, Longbrake, Masterson,
Wilson forming a loose rank and making an unhurried attempt

to get organized...They look across at the unfamiliar terrain.

‘THEIR POV: THE BAYOU

Across a high levee...Marshes stretch to the horizon line.
Thin pines rise out of the misty swamps; the trees are
bearded with moss but their branches are dead and bare.
 

15.
SATURDAY MID-DAY
THE 1ST SQUAD

Still near their truck; around them the bivouac area is
jumping with activity as Guardsmen start digging trenches
for latrines, laying wire, pitching tents. A Lieutenant is
barking orders from the perimeter of the clearing.

LIEUTENANT
Sergeant! Get your men digging
in...I don't want to see you. I£
I can see you, the enemy can see
you...Set up your security.

He notices the men of the Ist Squad.

LIEUTENANT
Hey you meatballs! What the hell
do you think you're doing there...
Why aren't you with your platoon?

ATWATER
Special detail, sir.

LIEUTENANT
What kind of detail?

ATWATER
With the truck. Make sure it's
not captured, Sir.

LIEUTENANT
Get over with your unit. Now!
Load and lock down.

They slowly move off. The Lieutenant turns his back; Wilson
uses this opportunity to give him a quick finger.

CUT TO:

THE 1ST SQUAD

Sitting in the shade, slowly feeding blanks into the magazine
clips. Longbrake is loading the big M-60 Machine Gun, ammo
belts draped around his neck.

Hey Calvelli, bet you thought

all the Louisiana Guard did was
beat up on college kids and tear |
gas niggers.

The kind of comment that gives Wilson an opening.

WILSON
Please mistah guardsman, no moah
canisters. Don't let that shepherd , |
dog loose on me.

Longbrake wants to have some fun at the new man's expense
as well; with studied casualness he points the big M-60 at

Calvelli.
CALVELLI
ji Yeah, I remember seeing you guys
on television, and say, pal...

(pushes machine gun
barrel away)
don't be pointing that thing at me.

LONGBRAKE
Only blanks.

CALVELLI
I don't care if it's hundred
dollar bills, don't point it
at me.

Edgy silence, long looks between the two men. Atwater decides
to break the tension, only right since he was the one that
first got the ball rolling.

ATWATER
Longbrake, don't you be picking
on our new man. Got to be polite
to them foreign boys.

LONGBRAKE

Same difference.

CALVELLL
Yeah. Right.

Norman runs up from across the clearing.

NORMAN
Alright, let's hurry it up. Don't
just sit there. Soon as you're
finished, go over with the rest of
the platoon and get squared away.

ATWATER
Yes, Norman.

— LONGBRAKE
Fuck you, Norman.

SMITH
Too hot to be hurryin'.

Norman waits impatiently while the Squad slowly pick them-
selves up.

ATWATER
Suppose. you're used to a little
more serious soldiering back in
| New Jersey.

CALVELLI
Yeah, we had things organized.
The only thing we did was watch
the ball games on tee vee, shoot
dice, and sleep.

18.
CONTINUED: SATURDAY MID-DAY

They get up and start moving, again looking off at the bayou
and the swamps beyond. Youngblood feels that the sight calls
for his personal comment.

YOUNGBLOOD
The primordial swamp. That's where
it all started, gentlemen. Right
in there.

ATWATER
That's real interesting, Coach.

YOUNGBLOOD
I know that you have trouble
dealing with an abstract idea,
Atwater.

Atwater walks over near Calvelli, away from the main group.
CALVELLI

Gonna be a long fucking weekend
if I have to listen to this shit.

CUT TO:

THE 1ST SQUAD

moving slowly across the clearing; Taylor joins them, draws
them into a circle.

They light cigarettes, sit on their hélmets.

. TAYLOR
I got good news and bad news.
Bad news is there is no good
news. We're going on an over-
night recon patrol.

Massive groans.

Okay, quit your bitching and

TAYLOR
Levee up this way is our objective,
rendezvous point is outside New
Iberia. We're going to travel in
overwatch and movement in file
formation with maximum use of
concealment...Smith, you with us?

Smith obviously isn't.

SMITH
Sure am Sergeant. I'm really up
for this one.

TAYLOR
Good, cause you're going to be my

Big laugh from the boys. They know a good joke when they
hear one.

on each other. Everybody does their
job.

Turns away.

CUT TO:

THE 1ST SQUAD - AT THE WATER BUFFALO

filling their canteens from the spigots on the tanker truck;
fixing their butt packs, adjusting straps, ponchos...Wilson

is pulling the big P.R.C. two-way communicator into place

on his back, then positions the pads to keep it from cutting
into his shoulders.

WILSON
We sure get all the good details.

YOUNGBLOOD
This will be good exercise for
you. Put a little muscle in
your pants.

Youngblood enjoys his own feeble joke.

LONGBRAKE
That's the last thing I need,
Coach. Unless you want to take
care of it.

ATWATER
Anything you like, Longbrake.
Speaking for myself I prefer
women.

Life's full of surprises, son.

MASTERS ON
What does that mean?

Atwater's got their full attention. He plays the moment,
pausing, smiling.

ATWATER
I have arranged for a little
treat for the weekend, boys.
Six whores de combat presently
awaiting our assault...I'm sure
they'll fuck us in a more inter-
esting way than the National Guard
of the state of Louisiana has.

MASTERSON

You're not kidding, are you?
ATWATER

a I never joke about women.

LONGBRAKE

I haven't been laid in six hours.

I'm ready.
. MASTERSON

How they gonna meet us?

LONGBRAKE
Yeah, where are they?

ATWATER
Holed up, waiting my call.

Wilson, puts his arm
around the big P.R.C.
radio)
That responsibility for contact
rests on my old buddy Wilson,
and his trusty walkie talkie.

WILSON
You got one for me?
SMITH
Me? You mean us, don't you

Pause.
ATWATER

Now boys remember, the purpose

of the National Guard is to

keep you darker brothers away

from decent Southern women...

But in the spirit of the New

South I have made full arrange-
ments.

Smiles all around. And a few cheers.

WILSON
Atwater, you ain't all bad.

They begin moving away from the water buffalo.

CUT TO:

THE 1ST SQUAD - AT THE EDGE OF THE BIVOUAC

They are now nine combat ready men, walking in file. Sweat
begins to seep through their fatigues. Twigs and pieces of
bush now grow from their steel helmets. Sgt. Taylor has
field glasses, amp, flashlight and compass. Wilson is along-
side...Longbrake packs the big M-60 machine gun, ammo belts
draped around his neck. All the rest have M-16 rifles...

The Squad moves forward, walking up and over the levee toward
the bayou.

MASTERSON
When I was a kid, people used
to live all up and down these
bayous.

Government cleared them out.

CALVELLI
Must of been tough leaving a
real paradise like this.

The Squad clears the crest of the levee. At the fringe of
the bayou they slowly pull up, look off at the horizon.

TAYLOR
Norman, shape them up and test
fire. This is as good a place
as any.

Norman whirls and begins shouting; this is the kind of
assignment he takes very seriously.

NORMAN
Squad. Forma line. Every rifleman
20 feet apart! .

LONGBRAKE
Hey, Norman?

NORMAN
Yeah, what is it Longbrake?

LONGBRAKE
Fuck you.

The men spread out, open their ammo pouches, slap the maga-
zines into the breeches of their M-16's, slide the bolts

and commence firing. Atwater takes advantage of this moment
to aim and fire at Wilson...

WILSON
Don't do that, mother fucker.

Longbrake's M-60 machine gun spits out a few blank shells...
Then all goes quiet once more.

TAYLOR
Masterson, we want to move out
on a heading of zero six five.

He moves off a confident experienced soldier, qualities he

team.

THE SQUAD

moving off into the swamp following thirty yards behind
Masterson's point.

The quality of the moment so excites Atwater that he breaks
into song:

ATWATER
Over hill,
Over dale,
As we hit the dusty trail...

The spirit is infectious; the entire Squad save Taylor,
Norman and Calvelli join in.

SQUAD
And those caissons keep rolling along.
It's hi hi hee
In the field artillery
And those caissons go rolling...

Some members of the Bravo Team substitute the words "fuck-up"
for caissons.

INT. SWAMP DAY

Hot, humid, dense foliage climbing alongside a small bayou,
twenty yards wide. The muddy water is still and tepid,
punctuated only by floating water vegetation. Birds call,
the buzz of insects, a bull frog belches.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON

 

ACROSS THE BAYOU - MASTERSON

His camouflage blends him into the foliage. He looks right,
then left, up the bayou, swings his rifle onto his shoulder
and takes a reading.

THE COMPASS

in palm of right hand. His left hand shields the dial from
the blazing sun.

MASTERS ON

snaps the compass closed, tucks it away, wipes the sweat from
his face and takes a long swig from his canteen. He gives an
arm and hand signal to those behind, holds his rifle ready,
and wades across the bayou.

THE REST OF THE SQUAD

They come out of the growth, in file, as Taylor waits for
them. Masterson visible across the shallow body of water
beyond.

LONGBRAKE
Where the fuck are you guys taking
us?

MASTERSON

is almost at the opposite bank when he stumbles...stops,
throws his rifle sling over his shoulder freeing his hands...

Atwater crosses, sloshing through the calf-deep bayou,
adjusting his backpack as he goes. Smith next approaches
the water's edge...

TAYLOR
Smith, how you doin' with the pace?

SMITH
Great. 461 meters...more or less.

Very large smile from Taylor; he's not depending on anyone
else for direction or distance.

TAYLOR
Right...Couldn't make it without
you, Tyrone.

Both men cross with Wilson.

ANOTHER PART OF THE SWAMP

As the Squad comes moving through. Atwater and Wilson dodge
among the branches and undergrowth, trailed by Longbrake.

THE PIROGUES GETTING UNDER WAY
They are tricky and rock easily and almost tip, but the men
keep their balance and both pirogues glide along, side by

MASTERSON SEES SOMETHING

He points back to the shore, laughs...

POV: TWO CAJUN TRAPPERS WALKING ALONG THE BANK

At this distance their features are unrecognizable, but they

TAYLOR
Longbrake! YOU ASSHOLE!

Some members of the Squad think this is even funnier than
when Masterson took a shot at the supermarket. Masterson

What do you think?

MASTERS ON
Fork to the right's East. Probably
easier to get where we want moving

him, approaching Norman who is busy working while seated on
a canvas groundcloth.

LONGBRAKE

stops to watch Norman put small rocks into an empty can of
peas taken from the shack.

LONGBRAKE
I got something to tell you,
Norman...hey what's that for?

NORMAN

now standing near the comatose Youngblood; the rest of the

Leave him there. Maybe he'll

Then again he stands; listens and looks...

He can see the rest of the Squad sleeping; The dark forest
surrounding all...A twig cracks in the bush...after a moment

Calvelli starts to move quietly; not waking any of the others.

Calvelli now travels through the underbrush to the edge of
the bayou where he sees:

MASTERSON

holding the Trapper's head under water. The Cajun is on
his stomach, a rope ties: his arms behind his back -- Master-
son lets his head up momentarily then pushes it back into
the muddy water. The Trapper goes under, spitting bubbles.

CALVELLI

What the hell you doing?
MASTERS ON

This man's going to talk to me.
CALVELLI

Let him up.
MASTERSON

You stay out of it.
Keeps holding his head under.
Pause.

CALVELLI
God damn it let him up!

MASTERS ON
Sure.

Masterson yanks the Trapper's héad out of the water, pulling
him up by the hair. The Trapper surfaces, lungs bursting
for air.

MASTERS ON
Now you happy?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: SUNDAY NIGHT
Masterson shoves the Trapper back in.

In a flash, Calvelli's right hand slashes out - the switch-
blade cutting along Masterson's poncho...a warning slash.

MASTERSON
That's the second time you pulled
that on me.

Masterson takes out his bayonet. The long blade glistens in
the night rain. .

Calvelli backs away.

Masterson keeps coming.

Slash...slash.

Calvelli has no choice. The two men circle.

CALVELLI
Okay, you got it.

Masterson lunges for the gut. Calvelli takes the feint and
leans back as Masterson continues the thrust upwards, barely
raking Calvelli from jaw to cheek. A fine line of blood
seeps out of the razored cut. Masterson smiles.

They circle each other, feinting for an opening; Masterson's
bayonet cutting circles through the falling rain.

Calvelli's left hand grabs Masterson's right wrist in mid
air, pulling it sideways, pitching Masterson off balance.
Calvelli pounces, the two men go down, each holding the
other's knife wrist.

ROLLING IN THE MUD
Once, twice. On the third roll the flash of the Cajun
Trapper coming to his feet breaks Calvelli's concentration.

For a moment, their eyeballs lock.

TRAPPER
Kill him.

They roll over again. Calvelli on top, on bottom, on top
again. Loses the switchblade.

His leverage has Masterson's wrist bent backwards, forcing
the bayonet from Masterson's grip. They roll over and come
apart.

Each man up quickly, each dives for the blade lost in the
mud.

Calvelli now has the bayonet. Masterson now has the switch-
blade.

Masterson lunges. Catches Calvelli off guard. Calvelli
throws his left arm up to block the stab. The switchblade

plunges into the lower flesh of Calvelli's bicep and sticks...

Calvelli's knife hand lashes up, misses, but his knuckles
catch Masterson flush on the jaw, a solid right hook.
Masterson stumbles backwards, leaving the switchblade stuck
in Calvelli's arm.

ACROSS THE WAY

Norman, Atwater, Wilson come running up through the under-
brush. Stop and stare at the two struggling men.

CALVELLI

leaps on top of Masterson; they both go down hard...
Masterson on his back; Calvelli on top of him.

Calvelli's left wrist is pressed tight under Masterson's jaw,
pinning him, gagging him. Calvelli's shaking right hand
holds the bayonet shoulder high...Masterson is totally vul-
nerable, his empty arms stretched out in surrender...totally
at Calvelli's mercy.

Calvelli brings the bayonet up higher.

TRAPPER'S VOICE
Kill him.

Hesitates.

Higher.

Hesitates.

Then plunges it deep into Masterson's heart.

The sound of laughter.

Calvelli keeps leaning on the bayonet...All his weight...
Then slowly comes back up, staring at the dead man beneath
him.

He can't believe what he's done. Can't believe it. But
it's there. Staring up at him. He did this. With his
own hand.

Calvelli gets to his feet.

Sees the shocked faces of Atwater, Norman and Wilson; dis-
covering for the first time that they've been watching.

Pause.

Wilson walks over to Masterson's body; looks at his
unblinking eyes.

WILSON
He's dead. Masterson's dead.

Longbrake arrives, crashing through the vegetation -- he
sees Masterson's body stretched before him.

LONGBRAKE
Lonnie!

He rushes over.
Looks at Calvelli still holding the bayonet.

LONGBRAKE
You mother fucker!

Springs at him but is caught and held back by Wilson and
Norman. Longbrake wrestles against their grasp -- fighting

to get at Calvelli who stands calmly looking at him, hands
at his sides.

THE CLEARING DAWN

The Squad huddled together in the pouring rain; forty yards
beyond them is Masterson's freshly dug grave marked with a
wooden branch cross, steel helmet on the cross strut. The
Guardsmen are all shivering inside their ponchos; their
packs in place ready to march...Atwater holding the end

of the rope that binds Youngblood.

NORMAN
We have three casualties, we're
not gonna have any more. Survival
is a mental outlook. Shock and
fear can be overcome by a sense of
responsibility; Loyalty to country
and military duty...Desire to return
to home and family. If you are not
prepared mentally to overcome all
obstacles and hardships, the chances
of coming out alive are greatly reduced.

ATWATER
Getting wet listening to all this,
Norman.

More heavy rain. The men are soaked, shaking, filthy, hungry,
tense. The surrounding vegetation is impenetrable, allowing
little sunlight to filter through; moss hanging from ‘the trees
like bearded columns.

leashed condition, are Norman, then Longbrake -- Wilson

Wilson stops, pulls his M-16 to the ready position.

WILSON
Hey.

The others ahead stop...listen.
Twang, twang, twang.
A Jew's harp, not far off.

Wilson suddenly wheels and fires into the swamp. The rest

Starts to run off through the brush, firing his M-16.
Twang. Blast. Twang. Blast.

Wilson continues running, chasing the sound...Stops, his
face twisting into an agonized mask...He tries to scream,
mouth open, nothing coming out. When the cry finally
bursts out it is a deafening cry of shock and terror.

Along the edge of the bayou in front of him a scarecrow
looms...

THE SCARECROW

Smith's black skin stretched out on the two crossed poles;
Taylor's white head sits at the top of the pole where Smith's
neck ends.

WILSON

As the rest of the Squad come pounding up behind him...

They dive for cover. Gunfire comes at them from all over.

Don't ask me. You're the one
supposed to know. .

Fire the God damn blanks...

Wilson opens up, Norman breaks for it.

NORMAN

He crawls thirty yards, dodges, runs...his M-16 left behind

for a match, and lights the rag. It ignites. He holds the

grenade, peeks out from behind the tree, stands and throws
the grenade at the Mudman...A perfect toss.

Chopper passes right over their heads...and is gone.

The men of the lst Squad stand in disbelief. Longbrake starts
walking off, after the helicopter.

darts, cutting and weaving through the towering ferns...

Eyes and lungs on fire, he staggers through the thicket and
mud...doubles over, holding his side, breathing like a loco-

rinsing and spitting, then forces himself on...Running again...
then trips, recovers, scrambling now on all fours, knees not
touching the earth...He pitches forward _and drops exhausted,
shaking, afraid to move.

ATWATER
There's food.

CALVELLI
What?

Atwater goes to the dark mound, kicks it, waits, then warily
kicks it again. Suddenly an explosion of mud and water as

a small alligator thunders out of its nest and into the reeds
beyond...Atwater watches it go then reaches inside the nest
and hands Calvelli a large, leathery egg. He reaches back
inside and pulls out two more, gives one to Youngblood.
Atwater stands holding one in his hand.

CALVELLI
Eat it. You're going to need all
the strength you can get...I don't
want you falling down on me.

Atwater downs his.

ATWATER
Chow time, Coach. Going to untie
you.

Atwater begins to loosen Youngblood's ropes.

cur To:

WALKING DOWN A SMALL BAYOU LATE: AFTERNOON

The three men now close to the limits of endurance. They
move slowly along the deep banks, water covered with green
pads. Youngblood remains untied.

CUT TO:

EXT. MUD BANK EVENING

Atwater and Calvelli dig at the steep walls with their
bayonets, making natural depressions wider. They claw at
the dirt, passing it out in the steel pots. Youngblood
stands watching the men carve out shelter for the evening.

LATER

The three of them lie on their sides. A small fire is
boiling water in one of the steel helmets.

ATWATER
Tomorrow this time you'll be
sitting in your den with a beer
and the tee vee, listening to
your old lady's bullshit.

Pause.

CALVELLI
Yeah.

Calvelli starts cleaning his wound.

CALVELLI
Full of dirt. ~

ATWATER
Infected?

CALVELLI
Probably.

ATWATER

Let me help you with that.
Atwater wraps up Calvelli's arm.

CALVELLI
Some nurse.

ATWATER
Yeah, but I'm easy.

Pause.
CALVELLI
Terrific state you got here,

Atwater. They send out two
helicopters. :

ATWATER
What do you want them to do
send out the National Guard?

CUT TO:

EXT. BAYOU DAWN

Sun starts to filter through the covering fog. Atwater
sleeping heavily, exhausted...Calvelli in a sentry position...
fatigue has taken its toll with him as well -- he sleeps

CONTINUED: TUESDAY MORNING
fitfully...Youngblood nowhere to be seen.
The ground begins to shake, a roaring noise...Calvelli awakens
as the sound and shaking increase...Then suddenly from fifty
yards away a train whistle blasts...from out of nowhere a
locomotive and flatcars roar by at seventy miles an hour.
The railroad embankment obscured from Calvelli's vision by
the dense foliage.

Atwater leaps to Calvelli's side. They both run toward the
embankment, shouting to each other above the roar.

ATWATER
Where the fuck did this come from?

CALVELLI
I don't know but I love it.

Big smiles on both men's faces; they slap five.

After a few moments, the end of the train whips by...

ATWATER AND CALVELLI
Maintaining their smiles...

ATWATER
Never been so glad...

The eyes of both men tighten.

 

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACK

Youngblood's body hanging from the limb of a cypress tree;
the rope that Atwater bound him with now forms a hangman's
noose.

 

Atwater and Calvelli slowly approach the corpse.

CALVELLI
Poor son of a bitch.

Did he do it himself or did
they help him?

Calvelli shrugs.

CALVELLI
Doesn't make any difference
now.
DISSOLVE TO
EXT. TRACKSIDE MID-DAY

Two figures against the horizon line trudging slowly forward.
Thick foliage to their left, a long low reach of bayou to
the right.

IN THE DISTANCE

Across the stretch of water a small movement...

, CALVELLI
Over there.
Atwater looks.
ATWATER
What is it?
Both men staring.
CALVELLI

A truck. Fucking truck.

He starts running...Atwater lopes after him, tossing his
rifle aside...the truck almost looks as if it's floating on
the water...they move closer...the horizon line changing
with their progress -- crushed-shell road revealed on the
far side of the bayou.

As the truck moves toward the railroad crossing Calvelli
starts running faster, screaming...

CALVELLI

 

Hey! Wait!

THE TRUCK

| Has made a full stop at the crossing. The vehicle is a flat-
bed, old, delapidated, rusty...An Elderly Cajun Couple in the
front seat. Calvelli runs up, Atwater a few paces behind.

CALVELLI
Wait...uh hello...

The Elderly Man smiles nervously back at the two disheveled
soldiers. The Woman doesn't smile at all.

A very long pause.
Atwater and Calvelli so moved by their first contact with

civilization that words are difficult...Atwater notices the
reluctance of the couple.

ress . ATWATER
They're scared.
CALVELLI
What?
ATWATER

Your guns. The way we look.
Calvelli sets his M-16 down.

CALVELLI
No bullets anyway.

Smiles at the Elderly Cajun Man and Woman.

MAN
You want lift?

ATWATER
Yes. Oh God yes, do we ever.

(CONTINUED)
 

 

124.
CONTINUED: TUESDAY MID-DAY
Both Cajuns laugh.

MAN
You get in back.

CALVELLI
Sure.. Next town. Right?

MAN
Sure. Sure.

The Elderly Man's grasp on English is limited; a problem of
little matter to Atwater and Calvelli, they hop on the flat-
bed of the pick-up...The battered vehicle pulls off.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROAD

The flat-bed pick-up chugging along, Atwater and Calvelli
stretched out in back. The truck turns down a narrow lane.
ATWATER AND. CALVELLI

Watching the marsh country slip by on either side of them.

CAJUN
How far?

ATWATER
You're asking me?

The flat-bed moves into a clearing...Many cars and trucks
parked nearby; Campers, hay wagons...

CALVELLI
What the hell?
EXT, CLEARING NEXT TO A HUGE BAYOU

Two hundred or so Cajuns; men, women, children, and assorted
animals, have gathered next to a huge bayou for what is

known to the locals as a Shivaree. Music, dancing, gumbo,
crayfish, jambalaya, alcohol make for a generally festive
atmosphere.

FLAT BED TRUCK

The truck bearing Atwater and Calvelli rolls into the clearing.

ATWATER AND CALVELLI

Hearing the music look over the truck to see what's going on.
The sight of two hundred Cajuns even at play is not reassuring.

CALVELLI
What the hell: is this?

ATWATER
I think it's one of those Cajun
luau's you were talking about.

CALVELLI
What happened to the town they were
taking us to?

Atwater shrugs. The truck has now stopped in what is currently
passing for the parking area. Atwater and Calvelli jump down
off the truck to confront the couple getting out of the truck.

CALVELLI
Where's the town? We want to
go to town.

 

MAN . .
Eat first. Go ‘town later.

CALVELLI
No. We want to go to town now.

MAN
First, eat. Have good time.

WOMAN
Shivaree. You have good time.
Town after.

The couple is open, friendly and not to be dissuaded. Atwater
and Calvelli exchange a look and allow themselves to be led
to the clearing. The woman continues chattering to them as
they move off.

WOMAN
You eat. You drink. You have
good time...
CUT TO:
BAYOU'S EDGE

Atwater and Calvelli cleaning themselves up in the bayou.
Children playing in the water around them. A short distance
away, the band plays enthusiastically for a.crowd of dancers
clogging on wooded planking laid out on the soft ground.

CALVELLL
What do you think?

ATWATER
I think I feel better. Cleaner
anyway.

CALVELLI
What about safer?

ATWATER
Yeah...0On the other hand I don't
think I'd lie down and go to sleep.

CALVELLI
Maybe we should forget about Mom
and Dad and try for town by ourselves.

ATWATER
What for? If they're still hunting
us, they'll find us in the swamps.
We'll be safer here.

CALVELLL
Okay, but we grab a ride with the
first car that leaves.

They are startled by a popping sound behind them. They
wheel around...

YOUNG CAJUN GIRL

A sweet faced, smiling girl of about twelve has opened a couple
of cans of beer which she now offers to our boys. Their sharp
reaction makes her a little nervous. They smile.

ATWATER
Thank you.

CALVELLI
Merci.

She smiles and runs off.

ATWATER
Relax, boy. These are the good
Cajuns.
CALVELLI
(unconvinced)

Yeah. You relax.
Atwater takes a long swallow of beer.

CUT TO:

EXT. CLEARING - LATER

The party is now in full swing. Calvelli is at the food
table being served a huge plate of crawfish and gumbo.
General gaiety abounds everywhere except Calvelli's face.
As he takes his plate and moves through the crowd.

CAJUN FACES - CALVELLI'S POV

Strange smiles, missing teeth...All appear sinister to Calvelli.
 

 

 

128.

TUESDAY AFTERNOON
CALVELLI
He sits down under a tree. He starts to eat, but continually
looks around.
CALVELLI'S POV
He scans the dancers, the band, everybody. He seems to catch
people staring at him and then looking away as their eyes meet.
A pirogue poles up the bayou and beaches. Two men get out. At
this distance they could be the two Cajuns who killed Taylor.
CALVELLI

He stares at them. Atwater suddenly appears and sits down
next to him.

ATWATER
What's the matter with you, boy?

CALVELLI
Look at those two guys?

ATWATER
What two guys?

CALVELLI
Getting out of the boat.

He looks.

ATWATER
Yeah. .?

CALVELLI

They don't look like the guys we
took the boats from? The ones
who killed Taylor?

ATWATER
I don't know. They were too far
away then. And they're too far
away now.

CONTINUED: TUESDAY AFTERNOON

CALVELLI

I think it's them.
ATWATER

Man, don't go gettin' paranoid

on me.
CALVELLT,

I got reason to be paranoid. So

do you.

He gets up and starts for the food table. Calvelli continues
to watch the two men. :
CALVELLI'S POV

The men move into the clearing. It's impossible to say
whether or not they are Taylor's killers.

CALVELLI

Watching them.

THE BAND

Playing louder...faster. Ocarina guitar, violin, accordion,
Jew's harp.

CYPRESS TREE HOG CAGES

Two huge four hundred pound porkers in wooden cages. Two
Cajuns approach the cages. One draws a huge gutting knife
and runs it across the bars. The hog squeals. The men

laugh. Then each man uncoils a rope and ties a noose. They
are joined by the two men from the pirogue.

CALVELLI
He watches the conversation. He gets up.

TUESDAY AFTERNOON
CYPRESS TREE
The four Cajuns talking and laughing. It now becomes clear
they are tying the ropes into hangman's nooses.
FOOD TABLE
Atwater is receiving a giant plate of food. He turns to see
Calvelli moving quickly towards him, bumping into people,

knocking over plates on his way. Finally as Calvelli reaches
him.

ATWATER

Jesus, will you take it easy.
CALVELLI

I'm getting out of here right now.
ATWATER

What for?
CALVELLI

I don't think I want to stay for
the hanging.

He gestures in the direction of the cypress tree. Atwater looks.

CYPRESS TREE

Two of the men are throwing the nooses over the branch of the
tree, and testing them for strength.

ATWATER AND CALVELLI

Atwater laughs.

ATWATER
Those are for bleeding the hogs.

CALVELLI
You're fucking crazy.

131.
CONTINUED: TUESDAY AFTERNOON

ATWATER
I'm telling you...

CALVELLI
I'm not staying to see if you're
right.

Before Atwater can say anything, Calvelli suddenly takes off.
Atwater follows.

DANCE FLOOR

Calvelli trying to move through the crowd on the floor.
Suddenly he's boxed in. A group of people with their arms
locked together dance around him. They try to pull him into
the dance. Calvelli panics. He punches one man, pushes
another aside and races for the forest. The music stops.
General confusion.

ATWATER

Moving across the dance floor.

ATWATER
No. Wait! You don't understand!

Atwater runs off after Calvelli.

CUT TO:

CALVELLL

Running in dead panic...branches and foliage cutting at his
face and arms, mud underfoot...he slows...begins walking,
the carving knife in his right hand.

A small glade appears before him, He enters, sees:

He smiles, gestures to Calvelli...A very innocent looking

child; the same innocent looking child that watched Longbrake
sink into the quicksand. Calvelli approaches cautiously,
still holding his knife.

CALVELLI
I want to go home.

The boy gestures Calvelli closer...closer.

Then Blackbeard steps out from behind a tree. Aims his rifle
at Calvelli.

CALVELLI

Can't believe it anyway...He smiles as Blackbeard fires, runs
for him. Blackbeard fires again...Calvelli gets to him, puts
the knife hard into his stomach...

Now Blackbeard can't believe it. Knife sticking out...only
the handle visible. He shoots Calvelli again. Again.

Cur TO:

ATWATER

Running through the swamp; he can hear gunfire...he approaches
a dense thicket, moves through, comes out into the glade...
EXT, FOREST - GLADE

Atwater crosses to the two bodies. Calvelli sitting up against
a tree, eyes open and very dead. Blackbeard on his back, face
frozen into a final mask.

The Cajun boy nowhere to be seen.

Atwater moves near Calvelli, looks at him.

ATWATER
We had it made. We had it made.

Sound of a Jew's harp. Atwater turns...

TUESDAY MID-DAY
MUDMAN
Standing there with his rifle...levels it...fires as Atwater
dives for the ground.
ATWATER

The bullet slams into the log near his head, he rolls, another
shot tears into the wood...

He can see Blackbeard's rifle, and the knife sticking out of
his middle...Both out of reach...He rolls again as another
shot tears home...Jumps up, makes a break for the trees...
another shot...

EXT. FOREST

Atwater running through the swamp...running, running, running.

MUDMAN

Following the trail of army combat boots. He moves silently,
relentlessly...

ATWATER

Still running but very fatigued...SLOWING...SLOWING...SLOWING.
Lungs bursting, he bends, doubles over, gasping...Can't move
another step. He kneels down, starts to untie the lace on

his combat boot...

cur TO:

MUDMAN

He moves through the terrain, following the visible trail of
footsteps leading past

TUESDAY MID-DAY
A THOUSAND YEAR OLD DEAD CYPRESS

Huge, bleached white, petrified. Just as Mudman walks by...

FROM THE MASSIVE HOLLOW TRUNK - ATWATER

His timing is perfect. The bootlace garrote has Mudman around
the neck.

THE STRANGULATION

Mudman pitches and spins, a wild Brahma bull, snorting and
bucking, but his rider hangs on...Mudman runs backward,
crushing Atwater against the great tree. Again. Again.
But the garrote doesn't lessen...

ATWATER HANGING ON

Mudman's elbows are pistons driving into Atwater's sides...
Mudman reaches back, grabs a handful of Atwater's hair, tries -
to pull Atwater's skull off, but the garrote doesn't lessen. a)
MUDMAN CRUMPLING

As the breath is choked out of him; his legs can no longer
support his weight...He stands quivering...makes one final
desperate reach back...

MUDMAN ON HIS KNEES

Then to his stomach...he flops face first into the mud...

Atwater still sitting on his back, squeezing...Finally

Atwater's hands let go of the two pieces of wood to which

the bootlace is tied...

ATWATER

Staggers to his feet. He takes Mudman's rifle and knife...

comes out of the swamp, in front of Atwater.
Atwater backs away, he doesn't want any more...The Boy
kneels next to Mudman...quietly sits there.
ATWATER
looking at the Boy and the dead Mudman...he turns and runs,
still carrying Mudman's rifle.
A BAYOU
dark water and moss covered lily pads. Atwater wades through,
coming out in open marsh...up ahead he can see:
A HILLY SLOPE OF GRASS - THE LEVEE
He runs for it, sprinting, just as a Helicopter comes zooming
across the tree tops...Atwater climbs the slope on the run...
ON TOP OF THE LEVEE
Running along its stone bed road, Atwater waves and chases
the Chopper. Though it's gone from sight he still runs...
FAINT MUSIC IS HEARD...voices singing, in Cajun French.
Atwater looks around, listens, starts walking away from the
levee, toward the direction of the singing...the music gets
louder with each step.

He stands poised, rifle ready...

A WOODEN BUILDING AHEAD

Pick-up trucks and campers parked in front. Some of the
vehicles attached to trailers and outboard motor-boats...

ATWATER

Walking toward the bar. The music is very loud. Unmistakingly
Cajun French.

QUTSIDE THE BAR

He stops and gathers himself, wiping away the dirt and sweat
and blood...Lifts the rifle, bursts through the door ready
to fire...

INT. BAR

Atwater's momentum carries him into the center of the room...
A sign on the wall, "World's Greatest Jambalaya, World's
Friendliest People". In one corner a group of Cajuns singing
along to the Juke Box. The rest of the bar filled with...

NATIONAL GUARDSMEN

in their clean fatigues. They play pool, cards, pinball,
darts...Some dance with Cajun Women. One of the Guardsmen
looks up as Atwater enters.

GUARDSMAN
Atwater. Hey! It's Atwater!

The rest of the Guardsmen look up from their tables.

ANOTHER. GUARDSMAN *
Jesus, Atwater, what the hell kind
of show you been putting on?

ANOTHER GUARDSMAN
We been lookin' all over for you

ATWATER

looks over at him. The Guardsman is at a table with Atwater's

four smiling Cajun girls...Their smiles more than a touch

confused by his disheveled appearance.
