Their pouches are sitting on top of a table in front o
Nobody‘s here. P £ them.

Gordon grabs the pouches. Chris qives a little look at Kate.
She trusted her gut. She found her way under life and death
pressure. And he’s acknows edging that.

THE PRESENT -- INT. CONTROL ROOM -- ITC CORPORATION

Stern paces back and forth. He's sweating. Can’t take the
wait, the pressure...

He looks at Doniger.

DONIGER
Two minutes now.

The technicians on the transit room floor are filling new glass
shields with water. Charging batteries. Clearing away the last

of the debris.
CUT TO:

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM -~ DAY

The oak door leading into the room is being pounded on fiercely.
Lady Claire is watching the door -- the wood is starting to
split.

Marek sees her.

MAREK
Don’t worry. We're not going out that
way.

Marek yanks the sheets off Oliver's bed. He uses his dagger to
slice a strip off the side of the sheet. Then he cuts another

and another.

His eye glances out the window to see Chris and the Professor at
the threshold of a doorway leading out into the courtyard. Two
fully armored knights are standing between them and the front

gate.
MAREK
Keep cutting, all right?
She nods. And starts cutting the sheets as Marek was doing.

Marek grabs his longbow and goes to the window.

EXT. COURTYARD -- DAY
Chris glances around to door jam. Trying to decide what to do.
THWACK! One of the knights in the courtyard falls face first

into a muddy puddle. An arrow sticks through his chain mail and
into his back. .

VOICE
Go! Go! :
CHRIS
(looking up)
It’s Marek.

The second knight turns around to see Marek in the window --
firing an arrow at him.

He runs for cover.
Chris, the Professor, Kate, and Gordon rush out of the doorway.

Chris and Gordon carry swords. The Professor and Kate have
spray bottles and fire cubes ready.

CHRIS
Andre!

Chris tosses Marek’s pouch up to him.

INT. OLIVER‘S ROOM -- DAY

Marek grabs the pouch in mid air. Gives a little good luck
salute to Chris and turns back to Claire.

She has cut the entire top sheet into strips.
The oak door is splitting apart.

MAREK
That's enough.

Marek rushes to the bed and starts knotting the strips together
end to end.

CUT TO:
EXT. COURTYARD -- DAY

Chris sprays a guard in the face with the knockout gas. The
guard swings his sword wildly, then falls over.

Kate, Chris, the Professor, and Gordon run through the front gate
and toward a fallow field next to the small village.

C) They are less than a minute away from the field. From a large
open space. i

Stern is balling his fists up, about to burst with anxiety.
The Chief Technologist is typing commands on his computer.

Okay...we’re powering up.... Almost.

Almost there. 60% 80% Rene. We're

operational.
There's a huge sigh of relief from Stern.

cur TO:

EXT. CASTELGARD -- DAY
Chris, Kate and the Professor race toward the open field.

Soldiers are a few seconds behind them. Two knights on horseback

emerge from the manor house.

Gordon is way ahead of the others. And he’s not looking back.
He’s almost at the field.

A few more feet. A few more-- He's there.

He hits the button on his marker--

--and bears an annoving beep like vour computer makes when you
pur_inia command it won't accept.

He looks down at the marker. Hits the call button again.
BEEP-- A little red light flashes through the white ceramic.

GORDON
Shit!

He hits the marker again and again. Increasingly frantic.

Only now does he look at Chris, Kate, and the Professor. They
are just arriving in the field. :

GORDON
Try your markers! Try them now!

J Everyone hits their markers. Beeps all around. No go. No

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
“Down”?!

GORDON
I don’t know!

Chris sees the soldiers getting closer and closer -- and the
knights on horseback coming even faster--

CHRIS
Doesn’t matter. Right now we have to
hide.

GORDON
shit!

Gordon is freaked out. He's loosing his cool. Chris, on the
other hand, is dead calm. With each new obstacle, each new
brush with death, he is becoming calmer and more focused.

He scans the terrain around him--

Doniger jumps up from the console. Grabs Stern‘s shoulders.
Gets in his face.

DONIGER
You need to calm down!

STERN
Get your fucking hands off me!

He shoves Doniger away.

STERN
How - long - to fix it?
Doniger looks at the Chief Technologist.

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Three hours.

STERN
What about using the first generation
transit chamber?

 

Stern points to another transit chamber, dark, unused, through
another thick set of glass windows,

DONIGER
Can‘t do it.
STERN
Why?
DONIGER

We just can‘t.

Why? You said the first generation

INT. OLIVER'S BED CHAMBERS --~ DAY

The oak door is being destroyed from outside. SLAM! SLAM!

SLAM! It will only hold for a few more seconds....

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OAK DOOR

Black Plume is hacking the door to pieces with a battle ax....
The intensity on his face is incredible -- the determination...
With a pocket knife, this guy would be scary as hell. Witha
battle ax he’s your worst fucking nightmare.

INT. OLIVER'S BED CHAMBERS -- DAY

Marek has tied one end of his hastily made ‘rope’ (knotted strips
of bed sheet) to an iron eyelet and dropped the other end out the
window.

It's a five story drop out the window. Jagged rocks are below
them.

LADY CLAIRE
I don’t know if I can do it.

MAREK
Come here.

Marek fumbles around for his next words.

MAREK
Can you... You need to hold on to
me.... I'll walk us down the wall.

She looks at him.
The door splinters off its hinges. -

No more time.

MAREK
Arms here. Legs around my waist.

AT THE OAK DOOR
Black Plume steps through the shredded door with his battle ax--

--and in so doing he pushes on & trip wire that Marek has
obviously rigged up. The tension on the wire yanks a burning
torch off the wall.

 
O

10/5/00 72.
It falls on the floor in front of Black Plume. It wouldn't be a

oor--
It erupts into flames.

Black Plume screams and dives backwards--

EXT. MANOR HOUSE -- DAY
Marek “walks down the wall* hand over hand on the rope.

Lady Claire’s body is wrapped around him in a death-defying
embrace.

The moment is one of extraordinary intimacy, laced with sheer
terror. Of falling. of being hacked to death by Black Plume--

cur TO:
EXT. FOREST -- DAY

Chris and Kate race through the forest.

EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FOREST -- DAY

Gorden rushes through the trees. The Professor is falling behind
and Gordon isn’t slowing down to‘help him. | :

STAY with the Professor as he runs.

A knight on horseback is right behind him. Gaining fast. The
knight lifts a heavy wooden mace and slams the Professor from

behind with it.

The Professor collapses.

He shakes off the pain and tries to get up. The knight who
knocks him over circles. Another knight arrives and unsheathes
his sword, preparing for the coup de grace.

No. Don’t kill him.

Kate is hyperventilating. Chris is holding her tight, against

her chest, calming her.

Shh... Shh... It’s okay. It's going

They are hidden in dense underbrush.

KATE

It's not fucking okay. The machines

LADY CLAIRE
If we continue along the river for
three miles we will come to my

Marek nods.

But just ther he hears something... Horses. Galloping.
Approaching.

Then he sees the knights approaching. Four of them -- led by

MAREK
In the water. Come on! Come on!

Marek yanks her in.

MAREK
Can you swim?

LADY CLAIRE
Yes. But the current is strong.

MAREK
Take my hand.

They start floating down stream. As they move toward the center
of the river the current gets stronger. They move faster.

Marek looks to the other side of the river. Two more knights.
Shit. Nowhere to go. No move to make. .

The knights just trot along the bank. They‘ve got all the time
in the world.

Marek watches them. Looks into Black Plume‘s eyes...

LADY CLAIRE
Sir Andre--
He turns to look where she is pointing. A few hundred yards
down the river there is a fortified bridge. A mill is integrated

into the structure. Several water wheels turn underneath the
bridge. Passing between the wheels could be very dangerous.

The current is picking up.

LADY CLAIRE
What now?

Marek stares at the water wheels. At the bridge.

MAREK
I have an idea.

 
 

10/5/00 78.

EXT. EDGE OF THE RIVER -- DAY

Black Plume eyes Marek from the river bank. Next to the mill
bridge. He motions for his men to enter the structure from both
sides.

BLACK PLUME
(to himself)
What are you doing, rogue? Whatever
it is, I assure you, it will be in
vain...

The junior knight next to Black Plume, looks over at him, knows
his master speaks the truth...

 

EXT. RIVER -- DAY

The river is all white water here. Marek swims directly for one
of the water wheels.

As he reaches it he grabs hold of the spokes, then steps up onto
one of the paddles, lifting Lady Claire with him.
INT. MILL BRIDGE -- DAY

Marek and Lady Claire jump off the water wheel into a small dark
room. They are dripping wet. She is shivering fiercely. . |
Marek leads her through a room full of two rows of trip-hammers

clanging loudly onto blacksmiths’ anvils. This is a medieval

metal shop. What‘s odd is -- there’s no one here. It gives the

place an eerie feel. A sense of foreboding.

The banging reverberates loudly off the stone walls.

Suddenly a knight jumps out at Marek. Their swords clank
together.

CLANK. CLANK. CLANK.

Marek jumps over a row of hammers and grabs Lady Claire. |

MAREK
Come on!

The knight chases after Marek.

10/5/00 76.
INT. ELSEWHERE IN THE MILL BRIDGE -- DAY

Black Plume’s knights cautiously make their way through a room
with a large wooden chute in it. Periodically it spits out
finely ground grain into a huge crate on the floor.

The air in the room is hazy with yellow grain dust.

VOICE (0.S.)
In here! .

INT. ANOTHER GRAIN CHUTE ROOM -- DAY
The shouting voice belongs to Marek of all people.

MAREK
In here!

LADY CLAIRE
(suddenly scared
Marek is on the
English side)
What are you doing?

MAREK
It’s okay. It’s okay....

Then he whispers the rest into her ear.
Four knights are now in the room. _ Swords drawn.

The toughest, meanest-looking knight swings his sword back and
forth in a complex pattern.

MEANEST-LOOKING KNIGHT
Surrender your sword. Or you will .
surrender your head.

Marek calmly reaches into his pouch and pulls out a tiny fire-
starting cube. He holds it up to show the threatening knights.

They look at him like he’s nuts. . |

Marek pulls the string out of the cube and carefully places it on
a low railing. The knights watch the cube. Then look back at
Marek. Why does he have that smug expression on his face?

He's got to be nuts. That's the main thing they're thinking.

Until he grabs Lady Claire and literally throws her through a
small window in the wall behind them. A split second later he
dives out after her.

The entire bridge explodes!

Marek and Lady Claire can see the flames through the water, and
the debris as it splashes down through the surface and sinks

toward them.

EXT. RIVER -- DAY
Marek and Lady Claire surface to behold the destroyed bridge.
She is completely flabbergasted. Stunned by what has occurred.

LADY CLAIRE
How did you do it? You work magic,
knight.

MAREK

No magic. Grain dust explodes when it
comes into contact with fire.

LADY CLAIRE
But there was no fire.

MAREK
The cube makes fire.

LADY CLAIRE
With magic.

MAREK
With science. I will explain--
THUMP! UGGHHH !
Marek suppresses a scream. An arrow juts from his left
shoulder...

The next one won't hit your arm...

Marek turns to see Black Plume with his long bow drawn -- an
arrow aimed at Marek’s chest.

(trying to bolster

Marek)
Enough time for Lady Claire to tell us
about your daring rescue attempt. She
says you have the bravery of ten men.
Those are her words, not mine.

LADY CLAIRE
Ten men at least. Perhaps twenty.

Marek looks at her, into her eyes.

The sounds of a metal door being opened. Everyone stops,
listens. Footsteps now, getting closer...

A key placed in a lock -- turning. CLANK. And the door to their
cell swings open.

Black Plume stands at the threshold.
FIND John Gorden -- his eyes go wide at the sight --

His jaw drops open --

GORDON
Holy shit...

BLACK PLUME
Hey, John... Been a while--

Huh? Do these two know each other? Impossible--

Black Plume draws his sword and thrusts it into Gordon‘s belly--

BLACK PLUME
You rat-fucking son-of-a bitch.

Gordon’s stares back at him, eyes the size of saucers.

Needless to say the Professor and Marek are pretty goddamned
stunned themselves.

Black Plume removes his sword and Gordon collapses on the ground.

BLACK PLUME
(to guard behind
him)
Get her out of here.

The guard unlocks Lady Claire and whisks her out.

Black Plume kneels on the ground next to Gordon, grabs him by the
hair and lifts his head so their eyes can meet.

“Gordon tries to say something. A few raspy sounds. But he has
no breath. His lungs have been punctured.

Slowly his eyes close. He's dead.
There is a beat of silence.

Black Plume takes a deep breath. A cleansing breath. It’s as
if a huge weight has been lifted from his shoulders.

Then he rips the marker from around Gordon's neck, drops it on

Winston-Salem, North Carolina. I
spent twelve years in the Marine Corps
before John Gordon recruited me to
come work for ITC.

us earlier).

DE KERE (AKA BLACK PLUME)

He lifts his chain mail to reveal vicious scars all over his
body.

DE KERE
It’s a fucking miracle I survived.
The priest in Casteigard certainly
thought so. And since French archers
had shot me...let’s just say I had all
the credibility I needed with Oliver.

Marek and Professor Johnston look at De Kere....

MAREK
They told us they’d never been more
than a hundred yards--

DE KERE

Doniger’s a fucking liar. So take
whatever he told you with a grain of
salt. We surveyed this whole valley.

You were pretty impressive this

Minor errors occur every time you're

De Kere reacts to Marek’s smile with a smile of his own that
fades slowly into a look of hatred.

Just another egghead physicist.

There's a hint of self-loathing in that last sentence.

What do you think the FBI‘s going to
do when you walk in the door? Pile
into their sedans, stick a light on
the roof, and come racing out here to
investigate? I got news for you --
the second you say ‘time-travel’
they'll write you off as a lunatic. A
freak. Do you have any idea how many
lunatics call the FBI every day?
It'll be weeks, maybe months before -
you get anyone to take you seriously.
And by then we’ll have broken all this

STERN :
You're forgetting the fact that people

DONIGER

That they might investigate. But I
guarantee they'll start off with the
theory that you -- the lunatic who
walked into their office talking about
time-travel -- chopped them up into
little pieces and fed them to the
fish. And Dr. Stern -- let me remind
you of something -- I’m worth six

i124 . With resources like

will be for me to manufacture enough
evidence for you to end up in jail?

Hardball. Like Stern never even dreamed it could be played. He
just stands there, stunned.

Totally stunned.

DONIGER
Now, sit down and shut the fuck up.
And I'll try to get your friends
back...

Stern just stares at him. And now we notice that he’s not the

EXT. ROAD TO LA ROQUE -- LATE AFTERNOON

La Roque is visible atop a high cliff in the distance. The
epitome of a medieval fortress. Massive. Impenetrable.

The Professor and Marek sit in chains on a horse drawn cart.
They look pale, exhausted, on the verge of collapse -- mental and
physical.

Marek looks at another cart in front of them. Lady Claire sits
on it, also in chains. They watch each other.

Both carts are surrounded by armed men on horseback.

There's one piece of good news in all

this. I destroyed the open marker.

Marek looks at him.

De Kere was wearing it. All that
stuff Doniger said about losing it
himself was just bullshit.

Johnston pulls up the sleeve of his tunic and reveals the
tracking device. A message reads: “deactivation achieved.”

MAREK
That‘'s good.

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
That's good for the world.

MAREK
Are we really going to help Oliver
turn the tides against Arnaut?
Oliver is supposed to die in the siege
of 1357. What if we help Oliver
live? What if what we do means
Arnaut dies? We're changing the
course of history... It could... God
knows what it could do to our world.
Not that we're ever getting back
there. Doniger might not send
anybody after us-- .

The Professor glances at his countdown clock. It reads three
pours. Three hours until their markers expire.

And, for the record, Oliver will die
tonight. Arnaut will win the siege.
You know why? Because he’s going to
catch Oliver off guard. He's going to
sneak his best knights into La Roque
through the secret passageway that
runs from that monastery right

forth in your letter. Instead he will
allow you thirty minutes to surrender.
If you do so, he will grant mercy. If
you refuse, my master suggests that
you make peace with God for you will
be meeting him presently.

Oliver is stunned. Just completely dumbfounded. The gall. The
fucking gall.... .

The shock wears off and Oliver's face begins to darken...

He looks around him. Hundreds of people are looking at him. His
soldiers. His knights. The entire castle.

Everyone is silent. You could hear a pin drop.
FRENCH MESSENGER
I am authorized to take your answer
back verbally, or, if you would prefer
to write a response--

into the messenger’s neck.

in place.

The Professor and Marek look back at him. Afraid to respond.
Afraid to make things worse.

LORD OLIVER

Sir William believes I should spare
you. He says that, in exchange for
your lives, you will make me gunpowder
far superior to that made by my
engineers. He says that you have

If not, you will die.

A WHOOSHING sound is heard. It is getting louder, fast.

Oliver spins to see a huge ball of flame coming toward them.
From this angle it looks as if it has been shot out of the sun
itself. .

The flaming sphere careens over their heads and slams onto a roof
atop the inner curtain wall.

The wood shingle roof bursts into flames.

And now we see that the flaming projectile was a dead cow.
covered in flaming pitch...

The Professor stares at it, incredulous...

Well, that certainly makes an

projectiles.

A huge boulder seems to be heading right for them--
Everybody hits the deck.

Stone crumbles around the point of impact.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS -- LA ROQUE FORTRESS -- NIGHT

A huge flaming stone slams into the top of the battlements,
smashing off the crenellations and dropping into the courtyard.

A few feet away, the Professor and Marek stand with Lord Oliver
and De Kere.

Oliver‘s troops have set up small catapults and primitive cannons
atop the battlements.

THE PROFESSOR
Because he is not confined by a
fortress, the enemy is able to build
larger catapults, catapults with the
range to hit you, while you are unable
to hit him with your small catapults.

The Professor nods to one of Oliver's troops who sticks a huge
metal arrow into a cannon and lights it.

BOOM.

There is a puff of black smoke and the arrow shoots out --
travelling only about halfway to Arnaut’s lines.

THE PROFESSOR
Your cannons are, likewise, impotent
because your gunpowder does not
explode with sufficient force.

Marek looks at Lady Clairé who is still chained up near Lord
Oliver. Their eyes meet....

THE PROFESSOR
My powder is in that cannon. And on
the tip--

The Professor takes a heavy metal arrow, dips the tip in a gooey
mixture.

LORD OLIVER
(excited)
Is it Greek Fire?

THE PROFESSOR
No, my lord. Better. The fire of
Athenaios of Naukratis, which ds
called “automatic fire.”

Is that so? . Show me.

The Professor lights his cannon.

The arrow explodes out of the cannon and travels twice the
distance of Oliver's arrow. It lands just ten feet from one of
Arnaut’s catapults.

LORD OLIVER
Is that all? Where is the fire?

Just then, the arrow bursts into a cirele of fire, spitting blobs
of flame in all directions. Arnaut’s catapult catches fire.

LORD OLIVER
A-ha! Yes!

In the distance we see Arnaut’s men run for water.

THE PROFESSOR
My Lord, that’s not all.

Oliver looks at him, confused. The Professor points out at the
catapult.

Arnaut’s men arrive with buckets of water and begin dousing the
flames. Only the water does nothing to quench the fire. Rather
it seems to it.

With each new dousing the flames leap higher. Arnaut’s men step
back, confused.

In the end they just watch helplessly as the catapult burns to
the ground... .

. LORD OLIVER
By God!” I must have a quantity of
this. How many men do you require to
make enough for every cannon?

The Professor looks around at the soldiers on the battlements.
The more soldiers he can tie up, the easier it will be for Arnaut
to take the castle.

Twenty will do. But fifty would be
better.

Soldiers scurry along the parapets.
Sudden activity--
LORD OLIVER

Prepare for battle! Prepare for

battle! The French advance!
Fires burn in several locations around La Roque. The walls have

been battered in dozens of places by Arnaut‘s catapults.

Out on the plateau to the west of the castle hundreds of men move
forward. Knights on horseback, archers, foot-soldiers with ten
foot long pole arms....

LORD OLIVER
Archers to position!

Dozens of English archers rush to arrow-loops and other cover
positions.

Out on the plateau, Arnaut’s troops continue to advance.
The catapults move behind the men. Still hurling stones.

Two six-story high siege towers, each covered with leather tarps
to resist flaming arrows are pushed forward toward La Roque‘s
walls.

It is an amazing sight -- a spectacle of approaching death...

LORD OLIVER
So, the pig survived our assassins.
Well, we shall bleed him on the walls
of La Roque then.
(beat)
Engage!

All hell breaks loose as Oliver's archers, with superior arrow
range due to their height on the castle walls, fire their first
salvo.

Hundreds of flaming arrows course through the night sky.

EXT. PLATEAU OUTSIDE LA ROQUE -- NIGHT

The arrows streak down at Arnaut’s army. Shields are raised in
near unison.

THUNK-THUNK-- THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
Arrows slam into shields...

But we hear screams and grunts too. Some of the long, pointed
arrow heads go right through the shields and into the men beneath

them.
Men fall. Flames erupt.

Arnaut -- atop his white stallion -- yells out something in
French and his men respond by rushing forward toward the castle
walls. Now the French archers can range the English and they let
loose a torrent of arrows toward the castle.

Their accuracy (like the English archers) is stunning. Men
behind cover positions on the battlements get hit -- even with
just. a tiny part of their body exposed.

An English soldier falls off the wall. He screams as he falls
the six.stories into the moat -- and is impaled on a row of
spikes which emerge from the murky water....

Now Oliver’s archers fire their second salvo. It is a strangely
ordered process of mass killing. One side fires. .Then the
other. Then the other.

A hundred arrows rain down atop the French. And the height
advantage of the English archers makes a big difference. Their

A tap-dance of arrows THUNKING into shields. Screams. A dozen

The ground outside La Roque is on fire in a dozen places.
Arnaut'’s forces are getting decimated. :

Atop the battlements Oliver screams with glee. Then he turns to
De Kere.

LORD OLIVER

Marek sees what‘s happening. His breath starts coming fast.
What can he do? How does he stop this?

He looks along the parapet walk, the only way out of the armory.
Four soldiers stand there to prevent his escape.

He looks back at Lady Claire. He hands are tied behind her back.
The noose is around her neck. Now a soldier is tying the other
end of the rope to an iron ring on the parapet.

The trick is to avoid jerking the

then. But if you avoid doing
that...well...I have personally seen
people live for close to an
hour...choking slowly...their eyes
bulging further and further out of
their sockets...

EXT. ARMORY -- NIGHT
Marek is going crazy as he watches:

De Kere grabs Lady Claire. Tries to pick her up and slide her
over the battlements.... But Lady Claire fights him. Wriggles
from his grasp.

Marek looks around frantically. His eyes fall upon a torch
which sits just outside one of the armory’s windows. (A
translucent pig's bladder is stretched across the window to avoid
any embers from making their way into the armory.)

Marek yells out at the top of his lungs:

MAREK
Oliver!

Oliver turns to see who is calling him. Screaming at him in such
a disrespectful manner.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

Oliver sees Marek. Just outside the armory. Marek is holding a
torch. With the flick of his wrist he could destroy the armory.

Lady Claire looks at Marek. Watches him.

EXT. ARMORY -- NIGHT

Marek stands there, holding the torch. The four guards approach
with their swords out. :

Everyone is dead still. The guards. Marek. Oliver.

THE PROFESSOR
What now?

MAREK
I don’t know.

Now one person starts to move. De Kere.

He walks toward the armory. His eyes black. He draws his sword.
Then he looks at it and puts it away...

He whistles to a page -- who brings him huge dual-bladed battle
ax. It is identical to the one Chris and Marek dug up at the
beginning of the story....

MAREK
Shit...

THE PROFESSOR
He’s calling your bluff, Andre...

MAREK
I’m not bluffing...

Marek tosses the torch into the armory.
Oliver can't believe it. His go wide.

The armory explodes with a ferocious explosion...

The shingle roof bursts into the sky. Wood beams go flying.
And stones shower the courtyard.

Sections of walls collapse...

FIND Marek and the Professor -- the explosion shoots out the
window that they are crouching beneath...

The overpressure escaping through the window prevents the wall
from collapsing on top of them...

Debris rains down on top of them, shingles, wood, chips of
stone....

The force of the explosion knocks De Kere and Oliver off their
feet.

The French leader shouts out a command to his soldiers. It is
repeated all down the line.

The six-story belfries (scaling towers) are pushed to the edge of

Other soldiers slog through the moat with high scaling ladders.

French troops are pouring in through it. .

De Kere swings the ax. Marek steps back. De Kere charges,
swinging again. Marek parries with his sword.

But the ax is so much heavier, and has such momentum that it
almost knocks the sword right out of Marek's hands.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Oliver throws open a heavy oak door...to find Arnaut on the other
side of it...

ARNAUT
I have often heard that the English
nobility haven't the courage to stand

Oliver and Arnaut clash in a spiral staircase. Arnaut swings

hard. Oliver parries, but loses his footing and falls. He
tumbles down the stairs.

 

EXT. BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

Things are going much worse for Marek. Bleeding from his right
arm, he is having trouble holding his sword with the intense grip
he needs to parry the tremendous momentum of De Kere’s double-

bladed ax.

De Kere swings the ax down hard. Marek puts his sword up.
CLANG !

And Marek’s sword goes flying... It clatters along the stone
walkway and falls off the edae..._

ANGLE on Lady Claire’s face -- devastated...

Chris, Kate, and the Professor climb up to the parapet to see
that the French siege tower has caught fire.

Kate shoves Chris, hard. He falls. An arrow whizzes over his
head. The group ducks for cover.

 

Three English archers are holed up atop a nearby guard tower.
They turn their attention from Chris and Kate back to the French
siege tower. But before they can get another volley of arrows off
French soldiers scale the guard tower and strike them down.

MAREK
Go!

EXT. BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

De Kere swings his ax back and forth, forcing Marek back against

a wall.

Marek looks over the edge. The moat is six stories beneath him,

and filled with spikes. He looks at Lady Claire, whose arms are
still tied behind her back.

De Kere smiles. Then brings the ax over his head-- No, he
doesn't impale himself in the back like Chris had joked...

He brings the ax down with incredible force. Marek tries to roll
out of the way--

THUNK!
Ahhhhh!

EXT. SOUTH WALL -- NIGHT

Near the French siege tower. Chris, Kate, and the Professor are
looking over at Marek -- 50 feet away on another wall.

KATE
Oh, Jesus--

She can‘t look. She closes her eyes.

But we FOCUS IN on the Professor. On his eyes...- Suddenly the
look of horror in his eyes is replaced by a sense of wonder...

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
My God--

EXT. BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

Marek’s hand is against his head. Blood is everywhere. But he
isn’t dead. He’s still moving...

And when he removes his hand we see that he is missing his ear...
 

10/25/00 121.

_) Marek looks up. And the look in his eyes is like nothing we've
ever seen... For he remembers ‘
“Bui «, the knight with the missing ear, the knight who married

‘

Lady Claire....

De Kere looks at him, trying to figure out where Marek's sudden
confidence is coming from...

It rattles him... De Kere swings. THUNK! Marek dives out of
the way, pulling De Kere off balance as he does. De Kere falls.
He rolls over and pulls out his sword.

Marek springs up and grabs the ax. Ina single fluid motion he
swings it with all his weight at De Kere -- who is getting up off

the ground--
THUMP! We hear the sound. But we don't see it. Blood

splatters... Then we see De Kere‘s headless body collapse on the
ground.

Stern looks Doniger in the eye. Then starts moving toward him
slowly, deliberately.

Doniger turns the gun at the Chief Technologist...

But before he can get a shot off, Stern dives into Doniger,
knocking him to the floor.

Stern, blood oozing from his chest, wrestles with Doniger, holds
him down. The chief technologist jumps into the fray.

The struggle for several seconds before Doniger manages to break
free. But he trips as he does and falls into the grenade-damaged
time machine Baretto returned in.

Doniger aims his gun at the Chief Technologist. But he’s not
quick enough --

Stern has already pressed the override button on the side of
Baretto’s machine.

With a BLINDING FLASH and a SUCKING ROAR. the time machine
activates. Doniger screams as he is shrunk down toward the
floor. When he’s gone, Stern turns to the Chief Technologist.

STERN
Is he coming back?

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
If he does...that machine was
broken.... The transcription errors
would....

The Chief Technologist shudders at the thought. An ITC
technician rushes out to Stern.

Stern looks down at the wound. It hit him at the very side of
his torso.

And specks on the floor grow rapidly until we can see Chris,
Kate, and the Professor. Full size.

to be taking for a while...

Kate and the Professor can‘t help but chuckle. Stern smiles.

Then there is another flash... On the pad Doniger left from
moments ago.

Everyone turns to look at it:

A shape grows quickly... It takes a moment for us to realize
it's a person. It's Doniger -- horribly deformed -- hideous--

Dead.

Eyes close. People can't look.

The group looks at a stone tablet in the floor of the church.
The inscription, in French, indicates “Lord and Lady Bujold’

We catch a few snippets from a modern historical interest placard
(in English) near the grave stone: “...both died on the same
day.... widely respected during their long lives by commoners and
nobles alike..... five sons who went on to prominence.... patrons
of the arts who assisted a truly astounding list of early

these two and he thinks it’s just fine. ,

Caught totally off guard, Kate turns crimson. So does Chris.
