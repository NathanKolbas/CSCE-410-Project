"ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE APES"

FROM BLACK SCREEN
SHOCK-CUT TO:

A SILENT DETONATION OF WHITE LIGHT
which builds to a blinding, nuclear intensity.

CUT TO:
INT. ORBITING SPACESHIP

through whose windows the same light lividly illuminates
three space-suited and helmeted ASTRONAUTS -- afraid
and curiously hesitant at the controls. We establish a
Dual Date Meter showing the year in terms both of "EARTH
TIME" and "SELF-TIME". Both panels read: 3955.

ASTRONAUT 1 (MALE)
Were we wise ... ?

ASTRONAUT 2 (MALE)
We were agreed. Whoever wins the
war, there be no place on Earth
for us. We've escaped.

ASTRONAUT 1 (MALE)
And where are we escaping?

ASTRONAUT 3 (FEMALE)
(briskly)
Probably to our death. But just
possibly--

OUT
P.O.V. SHOT - EARTH'S RIM WHITENS TO INCANDESCENCE

and a soundless explosion sends a column of fire and
cloud mushrooming up towards us.

SPACESHIP

Appalled silence. Through the ship's windows the
ASTRONAUTS are watching (and we with them) the nuclear
‘disintegration of Earth. In awed voices:

ASTRONAUT 2
The fools have finally destroyed
themselves.

ASTRONAUT 1
Earth is dead.
ASTRONAUT 3
And we live.

A-4

The spaceship begins to shudder.
ASTRONAUT 2
But for how long? Here comes the

shock wave.

The shock wave of the huge, megatonic explosion hits
the spaceship from below.

Chaos and pandemonium inside. We multiply normal air
turbulence a thousandfold and are bashed, buffeted,
whirled, twirled, lifted a hundred miles and dropped
fifty, before slowly flattening out to some semblance
of equilibrium on (presumably) anew orbit. The Date
Meter digits under "EARTH TIME" have begun to click
and race erratically.

Meanwhile, the bright, white light of Earth’s final
holocaust has slowly faded, as the spaceship's windows
fog and blacken. All that can now be heard is frenzied
static on the ship's radio. The static begins to
cross-fade into (unbelievably yet unmistakably!) a
single human voice.

VOICE
..-further student rioting on the
campus today at Berkeley Univ...
(static)
«»-police are standing by to...

More static, then the radio goes dead.

ASTRONAUT 2
He's speaking our language! I
don't understand ...

But we, perhaps, begin to. For we notice that the "EARTH
TIME" year-digits on the spaceship's Date Meter have been
simultaneously clicking back from 3955 to 1973.

ASTRONAUT 2
The shock must have ... unbalanced
the mechanism. I still don't understand.

He is looking at:

ILLUMINATED PANEL LABELED "AUTOMATIC RE-ENTRY SEQUENCE"
Across it curves the descending graphline which traces
optimum re-entry path. Beneath it are three dials.

Now (to the roar of released rocket propellant and the
wavering of dial-pointers) computer-controlled light-
dots begin to trace the spacecraft's actual re-entry

path, which sometimes slightly deviates to left or right
of the graphline but always approximately follows its
course.

ASTRONAUT 2
We've been forced out of orbit.

ASTRONAUT 1
(looking at panel)
We're descending.

ASTRONAUT 3
But where?

And indeed the spaceship is being pulled gravitationally
back into the atmosphere of:

EARTH - AERIAL SHOT - THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DUSK

We are watching it from the P.0.V. of a U.S. Marine
Helicopter PILOT flying on normal coastal reconnaissance
duty; and the coast itself (as plane banks to include it)
is California. All is peaceful, empty and deserted.
Until ... PILOT mildly reacts to an object beached on the
tideline far below. His prop-blades louden as he goes
into a steep investigatory dive.

FROM PILOT'S P.0.V.

We ZOOM towards the floating and still-unopened spaceship.
INT. PILOT'S CABIN

As he flattens off and reascends:

I have an object beached on the

Let us hope and pray that you are

possibility: that the Russians
retrieved one of our missing space-
ships and remanned it with astronauts
who have now accidentally splashed
down in our own territorial waters.
In the event they're still alive, I
suggest you order the helicopter to
lift the spaceship out of the ocean

should not be opened until landed

CAPTAIN
Yes, sir. We're in luck. The
sick bay's almost empty except
for a mauled fox cub, a deer with
pneumonia, ea depressed gorilla
and a camel. The Apes will be
hidden from the public. They'll
be quarantined. If they want
medical attention, it's available
on the spot. And the experts can
start giving them the once-over
first thing in the morning.
General Brody's very pleased.

COLONEL
Me, too. Can't have a lot of
monkeys making messes in the
Guard House. Have we fed them?
Like raw steak or something.

CAPTAIN
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees,
like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.

COLONEL
Good God.

CAPTAIN
(indicating paper bag)
They suggested oranges.

They have reached:
EXT. GUARD HOUSE

whose door is unlocked by an obviously shaken Guard
Commander (SERGEANT).

COLONEL
What's the matter, Sergeant?

SERGEANT helplessly ushers them into:

INT. GUARD HOUSE

It's rear section (behind bars) is furnished with austere but
serviceable beds, chairs, tables and a washing sink with
plates and cutlery in rack above. On the floor: a capacious
rawhide valise, from which ZIRA (gloved and shod) has
extracted a robe into which she is changing. Her discarded
space suit lies et her feet. MILO and CORNELIUS have already
changed. Their space suit are hanging neatly from wall
hooks. At COLONEL'S entry, MILO and CORNELIUS rise
courteously to their feet, while ZIRA struggles hastily into
her robe. From the threshold:

SERGEANT

Greg, give them their oranges.

CAPTAIN advances cautiously with paper bag.

We HOLD COLONEL and SERGEANT talking in f.g., while
CAPTAIN proffers oranges (which the TRIO gracefully
accepts) in b.g.

ZIRA, holding her orange, has gone straight to the sink
rack, from which she takes three plates, three knives
and three forks.

COLONEL
(not noticing;
to Sergeant)
Arrange prisoner escort for 1630
hours ...

ZIRA distributes plates and cutlery to MILO and CORNELIUS.
To CAPTAIN's astonishment, the APES draw up chairs and sit
round the table.

COLONEL
(not noticing;
to Sergeant)
We're sending them to the Zoo Infirmary.

The APES start meticulously quartering their oranges on
their plates with their knives.

COLONEL
(still to Sergeant)
They'll have company. There's a
gorilla in the next cage.

ZIRA, overhearing this, reacts violently; rises, picks
up her plate and hurls it to the ground.

COLONEL

Now why the hell did it do that?

The full implications of the plates and the knives only
strike him as we:

our
INT. ZOO INFIRMARY - NIGHT

We START on CLOSE SHOT of the deer with pneumonia, cradled
under ultraviolet lamps which (as we PULL BACK) prove to be
the huge, clinically furnished room's only light source --
for the sick animals must get their rest. We PAN past a
recumbent camel and mauled fox cub, into whose small sleeping
pody the rubber tube of a suspended flask is intravenously
dripping plasma; and END on a white-coated KEEPER (with
flashlamp) inspecting our APE TRIO, now installed in one of
two large, contiguous cages at the dim room's center: straw
for them to lie on; a bowl of water for drinking; and a
generous supply of oranges and bananas, one of which he
cautiously proffers to ZIRA through the bars, while playfully
patting her head. ZIRA rejects the banana and sleps his
face. Taken aback but still amicably:

KEEPER
Have it your own way, mate.

Clang! He locks them in and exits. When the light from his
flashlamp has faded to near-darkness, we hear an outer door
more distantly locked.

ZIRA
(outraged whisper
to Cornelius)
I'm not his mate. I'm yours.

CORNELIUS
Zira, please control yourself.
I think they're trying to be kind.

ZIRA
This cage stinks of gorilla.

She sits down disconsolately on the straw. Instantly
CORNELIUS sits by her and takes her hand. In undertones:

ZIRA
Cornelius -- where are we? What's
happened?
CORNELIUS helplessly shrugs. From the shedows, very softly:
MILO
I know where we are. I know what
has happened.
ZIRA and CORNELIUS stare at him.

MILO
In some fashion -- and I lack
the intellect to know precisely
how -- we have traveled from
Earth's future into Earth's past.

CORNELIUS
But we saw Earth destroyed.

MILO
And Earth will be destroyed --
just as we saw it. Only, since

seeing it, we have passed through

@ ... backward disturbance in
time -- did you notice the Date
Meter clicking down after the
shock wave hit our ship? -- and
we have returned to Earth almost
two thousand years before its
destruction.
(solemnly)

That is another reason for keeping
silence. Our human captors would

not be edified to know that, one
day, their world will crack like

an egg and fry to a cinder, because

of an Ape war of aggression.

His low tones have become just emphatic enough to disturb:

GORILLA IN NEXT CAGE
It shifts, grunts and whimpers uneasily.

The TRIO reacts. We CLOSE to:

We hear occasional call of a tropical early bird, and
CLOSE to two human early birds: LEWIS DIXON, a young
animal psychiatrist, and his pretty (female) research
assistant, STEVIE. As they walk:

LEWIS

(feeling in pocket)
The driver brought a report from
the Air Base.

The usual imitatory behavior....
mimicking salutes...hand-shaking
..-Bitting on chairs...eating off
plates with knives...but --

He hesitates.

STEVIE
What, Lewis?

LEWIS
There was a sort of rawhide
valise in the ship.

STEVIE
With food?

LEWIS
No -- clothes. Stevie, they
changed into them.

We have reached the Infirmary's main (open) door which they
enter after showing passes to 2 SOLDIERS on guard outside.

LEWIS
Okay, I'll be careful. Set up the
Wisconsin Multiphasic.

This is a screen which can be lowered and raised (like

@ window shade) between the Investigator on one side

and the Subject on the other. ZIRA winks knowledgeably
at CORNELIUS, who winks back. MILO gestures them into
more discreet behavior. KEEPER sets up apparatus during:

LEWIS

(to Stevie)
Unless the spacecraft was remotely
controlled, they must have been
conditioned to press at least some
of the right buttons. They can't
be morons.

(to Keeper)
The female first, Arthur. And set
up Tic-Tac-Toe.

To everyone's surprise and KEEPER's reliet, ZIRA promptly
squats down on her side of the raised screen. The hyper-
cautious MILO disapprovingly shakes his head.

LEWIS
She knows this one. All right --
let's make it difficult.

He lowers screen and displays a single red cube for
three seconds before reraising screen to mask ZIRA's
view. When he lowers it again, he is simultaneously
displaying a blue pyramid, a green cone, a yellow sphere,
@ blue cube, a red octohedron and the red cube. ZIRA
instantly selects the red cube, which she offers
courteously back to LEWIS. LEWIS gives an astonished
whistle; rewards ZIRA with a handful of raisins, which
she promptly eats; and STEVIE retrieves her notepad
which has fallen from her hand.

LEWIS
(indicating screen
to Stevie)
You can take that away.

STEVIE
I'll say.

LEWIS
Tic-Tac-Toe, Arthur.
(indicating Cornelius)
With that male.

32 Cont.1

CORNELIUS, in obedience to a warning glance from MILO,
permits himself to be led by the KEEPER's hand to one
side of the Tic-Tac-Toe screen. ZIRA is already seated
enthusiastically at the other, ready to press panel-
button combinations which will dictate the positioning
of the noughts and crosses; and after a brief skirmish
with CORNELIUS, ZIRA achieves a row of noughts. Whereat
she rises to her feet, clasps her hands above her head
like a boxer acknowledging victory and retires to a
corner, where she sits in triumph on one of a half-a-
dozen oddly constructed wooden boxes.

LEWIS
(rewarding Zira with
raisins)
Get her off that box, Arthur.
(determined to win)
We're going to need it.

KEEPER cautiously approaches ZIRA, who puts a hand on
his proffered arm and graciously rises -- while STEVIE
scatters the boxes about the cage and puts a banana
well out of ZIRA's reach between the upper bars.

This is a test unfamiliar to ZIRA, who responds to its
challenge. She speculatively eyes the banana; then
stoops to prowl among the boxes, which she carefully
examines without touching them. Then she straightens

+. and thinks. The tension is insupportable. Suddenly
ZIRA, moving into action, interlocks all the boxes so
that they form a somewhat eccentric staircase leading
to the banana. Having done so, she folds her arms and
smugly stands at the "staircase's" foot.

STEVIE
Why doesn't she climb?

ZIRA
Because I loathe and detest bananas.

' CORNELIUS
Zira!

As though in a slow nightmare, STEVIE sags and faints.
Somehow, LEWIS catches her and lowers her to the cage
floor. Somehow, KEEPER sluices water from the (refilled)
drinking bowl over her upturned face. As she recovers:

LEWIS
(sweating)
Help me get her away. I'l] come
back.

Jointly supporting STEVIE, they leave the cage, which
KEEPER locks. We STAY with:

MILO
Zira, are you mad?

CORNELIUS
Dr. Milo, please don't call my
wife mad.

MILO

I did not call her mad. I merely
asked her if she was. And I repeat
the question.

Are you mad?

ZIRA
I hate deceit.

MILO
There is a time for truth and
a time, not for lies, but for
silence. Until we know who is

And how in the name of God are we
to know that, unless we communicate?
We can speak. So I spoke.

MILO

And we can watch ...
CORNELIUS

A display of primitive apparatus --

ZIRA
(kicking the apparatus)
Primitive? It's prehistoric.
It couldn't test the intelligence
of a newt.

She kicks the apparatus again, and it collapses. The
GORILLA in the next cage gives a disturbed grunt.

CORNELIUS
Zira, calm yourself --

ZIRA
I am caln.

She knocks another piece of apparatus endways. Now even
MILO's self-control snaps. He stalks to the side bars
and (with eyes screwed shut in frustration) briefly but
fiercely shakes them before spinning round, with back
pressed against the bars, to glare at his two tormentors.
We SHOOT AT AND PAST HIM into the next cage where the
GORILLA now shambles to its feet and slowly advances from
b.g., during:

MILO
Stop arguing. It's too late for
that.

His body masks the GORILLA's crouched and stealthy
approach from them -- but not from us.

MILO
Stop arguing and start thinking.
Now that they know we can speak,
how much shall we tell them? How--

ZIRA
(screaming)
Milo-o-o!

Through the bars, two hairy hands converge on MILO's
throat and strangle him to death. The roaring of the
GORILLA, the throttled cries of MILO and ZIRA's screams
combine to launch:

Of alarmed birds and beasts as panic briefly infects the
Zoo. E.g., a sleeping owl. opens huge eyes; cranes cry;
mallards take off from pool; seals cough; apes gibber;
tigers snarl; lions roar, and elephants trumpet. We
might (instead of separating each cry) overlay sound
cumulatively so that each new noise is added to its
predecessors, as we build visually and aurally toa
massive and bestial crescendo before TIME DISSOLVING

THE CAGE

The "panic™ is over. Outside, two OFFICIALS confer in
murmurs with LEWIS. As KEEPERS 1 and 2 lift a blanketed
stretcher and carry MILO's body out of shot:

OFFICIAL 1
We shall want a full autopsy...

OFFICIAL 2
With particular emphasis on the
cranial and oral areas.

OFFICIAL 1
Keep him in cold storage till
the report's in. Then send him
to Taxidermy.
(wryly)
He's a museum piece.

A low moan turns everyone's head towards the cage's
interior. ZIRA sits crouched in a corner, her head in
her hands and rocking from side to side. CORNELIUS is
comforting her.

LEwIS
(to Officials)
I'd better do this alone.

They nod and leave. LEWIS enters the cage; looks
compassionately at the two huddled APES, the straw, the
orange peels, the bananas, the abandoned intelligence
test apparatus.

Do you understand? We mean

Slowly and bitterly, ZIRA points an ironic and accusing
finger at the next cage, where an anesthetized and chained
GORILLA slumps in the shadows.

LEWIS
But he isn't us. He's your own
kind.

ZIRA

(angrily on her
feet in a flash)
He's a gorilla.

As CORNELIUS soothes her:

LEWIS
I mean he's of your own genus.
He's an Ape. Look. You don't
have to be afraid. We've put
him in chains and under sedation.
Do you understand that?

ZIRA
I should. I've been doing it
half my life to Humans.

LEWIS
(dumbfounded)
Humans?

ZIRA
(as though this
explained everything)
I'm a psychiatrist.

A second shock. LEWIS covers dazed eyes with his hand and,
after a struggle, regains his self-control.

LEWIS
So am I. And I mean you no

I mean that in our 'primitive'
civilization, apes just don't
talk. I mean I think it's important
that, when our 'primitive' security
precautions are lifted, the first
time you say something in public

PRESIDENT
Gentlemen, I am aware that what
I have to tell you may create
a credibility gap somewhat
wider than the Grand Canyon.
Nonetheless it is true.

We PAN expectant faces and return to:

PRESIDENT
The U.S. spaceship, which splashed
down off the South California coast
yesterday, is one of the two which
were lost in outer space more than
@ year ago. To be exact, the one
commanded by Colonel Taylor.

Astonishment, but as yet no incredulity.

ARMY
Have they identified the bodies,
Mr. President?

PRESIDENT

(Kind of enjoying

himself)
They have identified three -- ah

though by an unhappy accident one
was killed early this morning in
the Los Angeles Zoo.

Stunned silence,

PRESIDENT
They are harmless, friendly and by
all reports extremely intelligent
and sophisticated creatures -- but,
being animals, they cannot of course
tell us where the ship came from or
how they got into it. I have there-
fore decided to convene a Presidential
Commission of Inquiry in Los Angeles
tomorrow, consisting of leading
experts in all fields relevant to a
situation whose implications --
whether zoological, biological,
psychological, medical, mathematical,
historical, physical or even spiritual
-- are numberless. The two surviving
Apes will be produced for the
Commission's inspection. The Press
and the media will be invited to
attend but not participate. I see
no reason any longer to conceal this
extraordinary discovery from the
rest of the world.

center, walk LEWIS with CORNELIUS and STEVIE with ZIRA,
The chained APES sit in chairs six feet apart...whereat
the AUDIENCE applauds.

NOTE: Whatever the APES do and (later) say is bound to
elicit strong AUDIENCE reactions -- particularly
at the outset,

LEWIS

Ladies and gentlemen. My name is
Lewis Dixon and I am the animal
psychiatrist who has been in charge
of these two Apes since they arrived
at the Los Angeles Zoo. My research
assistant, Miss Stephanie Branton,
and I are ready to answer your
questions. What may astonish you is
that our chimpanzee friends are
ready to answer your questions, too,

A confused murmur. The AUDIENCE doesn't get it.

LEWIS
Not by signs. Not by looks or
movements. But by words.

In a silence punctuated by uncertain titters, the
Commission's elderly CHAIRMAN rises.

CHAIRMAN
Dr. Dixon, as a zoologist, I know
and respect your work. But if you
think you're going to turn a
Presidential Commission into a
ventriloquial circus act, I have to
inform you ---

LEWIS
And I have to inform you, sir,
that these Apes have acquired the
power of speech.

CHAIRMAN begins to laugh; and, taking its cue, the
AUDIENCE laughs with him. When the laughter has subsided:

LEWIS
It is for you, ladies and gentlemen,
to assess how far that power can be
exercised intelligently.

CHAIRMAN
May we be told which is the --
ah -- ‘female of the species'?

Over further laughter, LEWIS indicates ZIRA, who has
simultaneously risen from her platform chair.

CHAIRMAN
Did she rise as a reflex to your
having indicated her, or in answer
to my question?

LEWIS
That is for you to decide.

CHAIRMAN
Have you a name?

ZIRA
(distinctly; as
though to a child)
Zi-ra.

A gasp of astonishment from AUDIENCE,

CHAIRMAN

(ruffled, but under

control)
Certainly she can articulate, which
in itself is extraordinary. But,
Dr. Dixon, are we to infer that
'Ziera' is her name, or some <== some
phrase in her own language which
means...'yes' or 'no,' for example?

LEWIS
(politely)
Infer what you wish, Professor. I
suggest you rephrase the question,

CHAIRMAN

There you are, you see. Mechanical
mimicry. Unique in an ape, vocally,
without a doubt, but...

(dismissive gesture)
Does the other one talk?

CORNELIUS
(rising)
Only when she lets me.

A moment's stunned silence, broken by a yell of delighted
laughter from ZIRA, who runs to CORNELIUS and hugs him.
Then with a whoosh! the entire AUDIENCE rises to its
feet except for CHAIRMAN, who collapses in his seat.
ZIRA, still chuckling, resumes hers. So, under LEWIS's
pacifying gestures, does the AUDIENCE. Except for one.

LEWIS
Professor Hasslein?

But HASSLEIN is not standing to ask a question. He is
standing transfixed by the limitless implications of an
ape answering unmechanically, sensitively, lucidly and,
above all, humorously a question which was not even
addressed to him.

HASSLEIN

No. Not yet.

CRONKITE
So infinite regression is --
HASSLEIN

--The moment when our artist, having
regressed to the point of infinity,
himself becomes a part of the picture
he has painted and is both the Observer
and the Observed.

Even Cronkite has begun to sweat.

CRONKITE
What, in that peculiar condition,
would he observe if he were observing
Time?

HASSLEIN
Imagine for the moment that Time
is like a simple circle -- because
a circle, like Time, has no beginning
and no end.

We have CUT IN the ANIMATION of a circle (with radious 12
inches) being drawn by invisible compasses; and continue

filling in the circle)

The bus has already passed. And
you will be alive.

(sigh of relief

from Cronkite)
Every single one of your actions
creates a minor disturbance in the
time-continuum, which enables you to
alter your future and that of others.
There are, of course, bigger actions
which create wider disturbances...

«--like an assassination, for example,
or @ war.

(leaning forward)
Mr. Cronkite, I do not find it hard
to believe that, in the dark and
turbulent corridors of Outer Space,
the impact of some distant planetary
or even galactic disaster 'jumped'
the Apes from their present into ours.
And indeed the proof lies in their

goblet, which he places on a low table beside her.

ZIRA
Lewis said only a sip.

HASSLEIN draws up a chair, takes a lighter and cigarette
case from his pocket, then "checks" himself. ZIRA drinks,

How many futures are there? And
which future has God, if there is a

Therefore, having convened in
secret session, the Commission
makes the following interim
recommendations:

One: The Public should be
Informed that the Ape-onauts,, after
their arduous space voyage and the
fatigue arising from its attendant
publicity, are to be afforded rest
and privacy in a location whose
identity will not be divulged.

They will then be found research
employment suited to their high
intellectual capacities.

Two: Since, however, there is
Justifiable cause for suspecting
that they have withheld vital
information from the Commission,
the Ape-onauts will in fact be
secretly conducted by their 'keeper',
Dr. Lewis Dixon...

had to be destroyed to prevent the
spread of the infection.

ZIRA
There were dog bonfires...

For the first time we see a tape recorder (concealed from
the APES) slowly revolving.

CORNELIUS
By the time the plague was contained,
Man was without pets; and for Man,
this was intolerable. He might kill
his brother, but he could not kill
his dog. So Humans took primitive
Apes as pets.

ZIRA
Primitive and dumb, but still twenty
times more intelligent than dogs or
cats.

They were quartered in cages, but
they lived and moved freely in human
houses. They became responsive to
human speech. And in the course of

CHAZRMAN
(reading)

One: By a majority vote the
Commission finds no solid evidence
for hostility by either Ape towards
the Human Race as at present
constituted in this year of our
Lord, nineteen seventy-three.

The MINORITY (including, alas, the CARDINAL) becomes
sufficiently vocal for the CHAIRMAN to hammer for silence.

CHAIRMAN

(emphatically reading)
The male's attitude is that of
a@ deeply interested and well-
disposed academician who studied
the alleged future downfall of
the Human Race with the true
objectivity of a good historian.

The female's case is different,

in that she undoubtedly committed
actions against the Human Race of
a sort which, if they were to be
committed today, would be called
atrocities. ut would they be
so-called in two thousand years!
time, when it is alleged that
Humans will have become dumb brutes
with the restricted intelligence
of animals? It has been pointed
out that what Apes will do to
Humans is no more than what Humans
are now doing to beasts.

We hunt aninals for sport. If

they are edible we eat them, which
the Apes do not -- since they are
vegetarians. For the purpose of
promoting education, we lock animals
in zoos. We dissect their dead
bodies and experiment on their live
ones in the cause of scientific
research. ‘This does not argue that
we hate animals -- only that we use
them for such philanthropic (though
admittedly selfish) ends as the
defeat of human diseases like cancer.

CHAIRMAN (Cont. )
On these grounds the Commission,
by a majority vote, deems it morally
unjust and indeed impolitic that
the two Apes under scrutiny should
be extermineted.

Dubious murmurs from the MINORITY.

CHAIRMAN

(holding up hand)
Nonetheless the Commission is
sympathetic to Dr. Hasslein's
conviction that the progeny of
these Apes could, in the centuries
to come, prove an increasing
threat to the Human Race and
conceivably end by dominating it.
This is a risk we dare not ignore.
Therefore:

Two: The Commission unanimously
recommends that the birth of the
female Ape's unborn child should
be prevented; and that, after its
prenatal removal, both the male
and the female should humanely be
rendered incapable of begetting
or bearing enother. Thus, the
parents can still be employed to
serve the community in a manner to
which their undoubted talents are
best suited.

He raises his gevel.

I now declare this Commission
dissolved.

pitcher of water on a heavy white-enameled tray.

He is about to set down the tray when CORNELIUS, still
fuming, shakes his head. ORDERLY looks hopefully at:

CORNELIUS loses his temper. Pushes tray (upwards, from
beneath) into ORDERLY's face, which the hot soup scalds,
as the glass pitcher splinters at his feet and the oranges
roll across the floor. CORNELIUS wrests the heavy tray
from ORDERLY and crashes it down on his head. As ORDERLY
staggers forward, his foot trips over an orange and he
falls -- hitting the side of his head on a corner of the
metal table and landing face downwards in the splintered
pitcher's jagged glass.

ARMANDO and LEWIS pass between them into:

INT. MASTER SCENE - BIG TOP

Dim and shadowy, for the audience has long gone home.
Again, there are three "indoor" cages flanking each side
of the entrance; and only the middle cage in the RIGHT-
hand sector -- containing the as yet unseen CORNELIUS and
ZIRA -- is lit by a single hanging electric bulb which
faintly illuminates the entire scene. From the shadows
STEVIE runs, relieved, to LEWIS and ARMANDO.

Oh, Lewis, = thought you'd never
come! Armando's been a saint.

ARMANDO
(smiling)
A minor one. St. Francis would
have fixed it better.

STEVIE
Never! Look what we've done.

We INTERCUT CHIMPS in cages, during:

ARMANDO
(showing first cage)
Here we have put the bad-tempered
and troublesome Nero. He gets
headaches and, like his namesake...
ideas. His brain is growing faster
than his crenium.

STEVIE
It's endemic among young chimps--

LEWIS
--and incurable.

ARMANDO
(sadly)
I know. He will have to leave.

NERO slaps his aching head and pounds the floor of the
cage.

ARMANDO
(showing second cage)
Here we have bundled the rest
of the troupe, including Heloise,
Abelard and -- Salome, your god-
daughter.

His eyes guiltily swivel heavenwards at this minimal
blasphemy and he crosses himself. Over a shot of HELOISE
suckling (model of) SALOME:

ARMANDO'S VOICE

circus.

ARMANDO does a double-take and begins to laugh, but puts
a finger to his lips before obliquely pointing, with
elaborate secrecy, through connecting bars to third (lit)
cage.

STEVIE
(smiling; whispers)
Look.

Obliquely (through front bars of second cage and side
bars contiguous with third) we see a vague FIGURE prowl-
ing back and forth. Then ARMANDO tiptoes LEWIS and
STEVIE in front of third cage, where we clearly see
CORNELIUS ... pacing up and down like any anxious husbard
about to become a father. In shadow at the cage's rear
lies ZIRA, head towards and feet away from us. In
whispers, as CORNELIUS abstractedly paces:

ARMANDO
And here are your friends ... who
are now alsc mine.

STEVIE
We cleaned it out ourselves. And
the mattress is Armando's.

ARMANDO
(shrugging)
I am used to sleeping hard.

He has spoken aloud. CORNELIUS stops his pacing and
sees...

CORNELIUS
Lewis!

I was not responsible for the
death --

CORNELIUS resumes his abstracted pacing and is unaware

of a minor commotion as HELOISE (in second cage) pushes
past other CHIMPANZEES to display SALOME through the bars
to ZIRA, who rolls over on her side to inspect the baby.

ZIRA
(through bars to
Salome
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...(ad lib).

This is too much for the nerves of:

CORNELIUS
Zira, don't waste your breath
and your strength! You know that
a child born of two primitive
apes will never talk.

ZIRA

Her face contorts. She gives a deep cry of pain, as we:

LEWIS's arm rises into shot from LOWER FRAME, triumphantly
holding (model) BABY upside down by its legs and slapping
it repeatedly to maintain breathing. Once this is assured,
we PULL BACK to include LEWIS giving BABY to ZIRA, who
lies with her back to us. She displays BABY to the kneel-
ing CORNELIUS, who rapturously stares and stares and
stares. At length:

We PULL BACK further through the front bars to include
STEVIE and ARMANDO watching. ARMANDO is lighting a
cigar -- presumably for himself. But as CORNELIUS, the
proud father, advances to receive congratulations,
ARMANDO offers the cigar through the bars to CORNELIUS,
who has seen enough of America to know what to do with
it. He puffs it -- once professionally, and a second
time catastrophically. As he coughs and coughs:

ARMANDO
No?
CORNELIUS
(hoarsely)
No.

He returns cigar to ARMANDO, who smokes it.

The electric bulb has been switched off and the light

thick tent canvas of the Big Top.

We PULL BACK from CLOSE SHOT: BABY MILO, asleep on the
mattress -- all but the back of his little head wrapped
in a rough, dark blanket which (SPECIAL EFFECT!) rises
and falls in rhythm with his breathing. ZIRA squats
solicitously beside him. ARMANDO paces up and down as
frustratedly as did CORNELIUS, who now sits motionless
on a wooden stool, staring gloomily ahead with his chin
cupped in his hands. STEVIE watches them from outside
the bars.

ARMANDO

I had planned it all so well!
In a month we move on to our
winter quarters in Florida. I
could have released you in the

Why did you do it, Armando?

ARMANDO
I did it because I like chimpanzees
best of all apes, and you the best
of all chimpanzees. I da it
because I hate those who try to
alter Destiny, which is the unalterable
will of God. If it is Man's destiny
one day to be dominated, then please
God let him be dominated by such as
you. Dear friends, before the
police come and the audience gathers,
you and your pretty baby must go.

From outside the bars:

All I can now do to help you is
give you this -- for the child.

From his pocket he takes a little medal on a short chain,
to which we CLOSE, during:

We PULL BACK as he gives the medal to ZIRA, who studies
it curiously with CORNELIUS peering over her shoulder.

Grey derricks, like clustering Eiffel Towers. Grey pumps

grey scrub tufted with grey grass whose sap has run dry
as lunar dust. We are on a moon, landscaped and arch-
itected by Man.

We END with LONG SHOT ANGLED DOWN from steep hillside:
the station wagon -- a grey beetle with side-lit eyes,
scuttling to concealment off the highway, and halting.
Its beetle-wing doors flap open.

LEWIS tries to counter the intense emotion of this
farewell moment by being brisk and practical -- but
never really succeeds. A few scattered lights switch
on among the derricks as darkness falls, during:

LEWIS

But once you're over that hill,
you're in more open country.

ZIRA wraps the BABY warmer against the beginnings of a
night breeze, which blows loose tufts of grass about her
feet.

I used to play there when I was
a kid. Nothing but hulks, mostly.
But you could rest and hide there

It has long since ceased to fulfill its protective

with rust that it is almost illegible -- dangles
diagonally from eroded wire mesh in which spiders may
safely spin. TILT ENDS on torn gap at fence's base.
CORNELIUS's hand reaches into LOWER RIGHT of FRAME and
tugs at wire above gap. It snaps like trellis with dry

leprous with dead mollusks, metal tubes that look as if
they would snap like cheese sticks, and, all alone, a
smashed glass dial that used to register "FULL SPEED
AHEAD" but now registers ... "STOP". At the road's end,
which is the water's edge, CORNELIUS and ZIRA halt and
look uneasily ahead.

ZIRA
The ship's graveyard.

CORNELIUS
Only for tonight.

ESTABLISHING SHOTS - GRAVEYARD

A shanty town of ships that have died'without burial --
beached on the mud or berthed in scummy water to rot
and rust under the sun and the salt air. Laid out
haphazardly, like corpses after a plague, they still
carry traces of their former finery about them, as a
skeleton may wear jewels: jet-black mussels choking
the iron neck of an anchor; a bollard's head, tiara'd
with barnacles; limpet-rings round the two splayed
fingers of a cleat; and a gangway (which the APES now
gingerly cross) jumping and swinging like the necklace
on a Balinese dancer. Perhaps the ships are not quite
dead. For sometimes, on the slack tide, they move with
an arthritic creak or touch one another with a groan --
these poor, amputated hulks who once rode the ocean as
proudly and delicately as dolphins.

The APES step aboard and survey:
THE SHIP
A decrepit coastal craft, sawn off clean at the stern
which is wedged against the sea wall, her aft super-

The BABY asleep on her lap. The sun is very hot. ZIRA
herself begins to nod into a doze; then (with a start)
realizes that she must not sleep exposed, but only in
concealment. She rises with BABY and enters:

INT. CABIN

Pretty dark, for the sunlight barely filters through the
two filthy scupper panes. And you wouldn't know it was
a cabin, because all the furniture has long since been
removed. She adjusts the blanket so that it will serve
both as a wrap and a pillow for the BABY; then herself
lies down on the bare boards (from which a cockroach
scuttles) with her head near the BABY. We SLOW-TRACK

LOOKING LANDWARD ALONG CATWALK
HASSLEIN is approaching the landward end in b.g., when
ZIRA in f.g. (with BABY) peers out of cabin entrance and
looks seaward, where the footsteps were coming from.

ZIRA
Cornelius?

Hearing the quick scrape of a shoe suddenly turning, she
spins round to confront:

P.0.V. FLASH - HASSLEIN

Five yards off and facing her with a revolver not yet
aimed.

ZIRA

Quick glance into cabin door. No, she'd be trapped
there. Swiftly she backs to catwalk's seaward end;
stoops and sets the crying BABY down on the Catwalk,
a little to one side and behind her so she can step
in front to protect it. As she straightens:

CUT TO:
FLASH - HASSLEIN FIRES TWICE

CUT TO:
THE BLANKET TWITCHES TWICE...
.»..and, as the crying cuts out, is still.

CUT TO:

HASSLEIN WITH REVOLVER AIMED

advances step by step on ZIRA. At his second step, we
may or may not notice the o.s. gangplank rattle once.
At his fourth step, a gun fires. The bullet hits him
in the RIGHT side of the neck. For a second, he stands
quite still. Then, almost apologetically to ZIRA:

HASSLEIN
Somebody had to begin to ... care.

The last word is less a word than a cough; and the cough
is bloody. HASSLEIN's eyes glaze, as he pitches forward.
Over the thud of his fall:

CUT TO:
CORNELIUS ON GANGWAY

Lowering Lewis's pistol. On SOUND, we reprise CRESCENDO
MUSIC mimicking the high-string "scream" in his head
(which he heard when he knew he had killed the Orderly)
and we HOLD "scream" until he speaks.

Now he staggers dumbly up the swaying, clattering gangway;
crosses the cluttered deck to the seaward rail, and clambers
up the catwalk companionway to:

ZIRA BY SHIP'S SEAWARD RAIL

As CORNELIUS precipitately enters shot, the "scream™
thins and FADES for:

CORNELIUS
(sobbing)
Zira, I've killed two men. I'm
@ murderer, Zira.

Hysterically he hurls LEWIS's offending pistol into the
sea. We hear the splash as she takes him in her arms.
And, in the first silence, we (but not yet they) become
aware of the faint barking of bloodhounds.

Now, with shamed, down-hanging head profiled against
ZIRA's breast, CORNELIUS sees:

P.O.V. SHOT - THE STILL BLANKET
Between the ship's rail and ZIRA's feet. Over this:

CORNELIUS'S VOICE
Is the baby...?

He cannot say the word "dead". And now our blood crawls.
For ZIRA's RIGHT foot jabs savagely backwards, kicking
the blanket and its small corpse under the ship's rail
and into the sea. Over a splash louder than the pistol's:

CUT TO:
CORNELIUS

Still profiled against his wife's breast and looking up
questioningly at:

P.0O.V. BIG HEAD - ZIRA LOOKING DOWN
She is sneering. And we hold this inexplicable reaction
until the barking bloodhounds and the wailing sirens grow
loud enough to wipe it off her face, as we:

CUT TO:
TWO SHOT

ZIRA imperiously beckoning CORNELIUS to the seaward
companionway's head.

SHOCK CUT TO:
POLICE SEARCH ERUPTS INTO GRAVEYARD AREA

Bloodhounds, handlers, jeeps, an ambulance and blue-winking,
shrill-sirened cars which eject more Police Officers.

The noise deafens. We PICK OUT one bloodhound hauling

its handler up the landward companionway to nose out ...
HASSLEIN's corpse.

HANDLER
(yelling down)
They're armed!

ZIRA RACING AHEAD OF CORNELIUS...
...towards the gangway.

ZIRA
(without looking
round; yells)
Cornelius! Get off the ship!

CUT TO:

REVERSE SHOTS - A WHISTLE BLOWS - THE HANDLERS UNLEASH
THEIR BLOODHOUNDS

which converge, in a snarling torrent, on the gangway.
ZIRA is only halfway down it, when the "torrent" hits
her and she goes under. When the bloodhounds disperse,
she lies on the gangplank, lacerated, bleeding and in
mortal pain. A CAPTAIN and a POLICE OFFICER clatter up
the gangway. The CAPTAIN looks down.

CAPTAIN
(curtly)
Put her out of her misery.

We STAY on POLICE OFFICER only, as he shoots her.

CUT TO:
CORNELIUS

farther back and higher up, amidships. Yelling down at
the top of his lungs:

CORNELIUS
Scum! Filthy, smooth-skinned,
human scum!

CuT TO:
DOCKSIDE - E.1. (ARMED) PUSHES THROUGH POLICE

and looks up.

E.l.
Come quietly, Cornelius.

CORNELIUS

Quietly? We all came quietly,
wanting to be your friends and
wishing you no harm. uietly?
When you've killed everything I
had left to love? Now kill me.
Or...

(right hand creeping

to pocket)
++eI'l] kill you.

We know the pistol is in the sea. We know CORNELIUS is
suicidally drawing their fire. But the POLICE know
nothing, and E.1. fires -- accurately at CORNELIUS's
right hand. CORNELIUS looks at the hand in scorn.

CORNELIUS
I said kill me.

Bloody hand in pocket, he begins to walk down towards
the gangway, simulating a gun-muzzle with two (pocketed)
fingers. E.1.'s gun fires twice -- hitting CORNELIUS
in the chest and shoulder. CORNELIUS walks on. The
CAPTAIN turns to the POLICE OFFICER.

CAPTAIN
(it could be with
compassion)
Let him have it.

POLICE OFFICER aims and fires his rifle. The bullet
hits CORNELIUS above the heart. At the gangway's head,
he halts, sways, takes his maimed right hand (unarmed)
out of his pocket and holds it over the death wound.

CORNELIUS
(looking down gangway)
You can't break my heart any more.
You broke it when...

He pitches forward. The gangway clatters as he slides
down it, face foremost, until his dead cheek touches
ZIRA's.

CUT TO:
STATION WAGON VIOLENTLY HALTING IN REAR OF POLICE
LEWIS and STEVIE push through, to confront:
FULL SHOT - DOCKSIDE AND SHIP
As an ambulance draws up at the foot of the gangway
where POLICE are laying out the two BODIES, another
OFFICER enters LEFT FRAME, carrying a third. A very

small body, and naked. The OFFICER sets it down between
ZIRA and CORNELIUS.

Cur TO:
SHOOTING DOWN OVER BACKS OF STEVIE AND LEWIS
as they survey the holocaust. Suddenly and in need of
comfort, he puts a hand almost fiercely on her shoulder
and turns into bitter profile.

LEWIS
Hasslein was right: It had to
be done.

We CRANE steeply BACK and UP to include a full aerial
shot of the scene, as the bodies are lifted into the
ambulance and the ambulance drives away. Now, while
the CAMERA still soars, we OVERLAP on SOUND: the noise
of sleepy lions grunting, the squeak and gibber of
smaller animals, the whinnying of horses, and the soft
thud of a mallet on wood.

FADE OUT VISUAL ONLY
AND
QUICK-FADE IN

ARMANDO'S CIRCUS - DAWN

The Big Top is being lowered and spectacularly balloons
to earth behind crates (being lifted onto trucks),
caravans, generators ... and a line of wheeled animal
cages which ARMANDO is approaching from b.g., as we
TRACK past cages and more slowly approach him. The
lions grunt. The tigers snarl. Dogs and CIRCUS HANDS
distantly bark and shout.

We TRACK ON IN to profiled CLOSE SHOT of ARMANDO. He
has paused at the head of the line by a cage whose
contents he masks.

ARMANDO
(throwaway )
Intelligent creature! But then,
SO...
(crossing himself)
...were your mother and father.
(shouting o.s.)
Ready to move in five minutes ... !

He walks out of shot between cage and CAMERA, unmasking
(as we CLOSE) an infant CHIMPANZEE. It stands, clutching
the bars of the cage through which it stares intently and
alertly. Then, in an opportune silence:

BABY CHIMP
(triumphantly)
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...

It continues with increasing enthusiasm to declaim the
first words (if you can call them that) ever uttered by
an ape born in captivity. We MOVE IN close enough to

identify the medal of St. Francis round its small neck.

FADE OUT
