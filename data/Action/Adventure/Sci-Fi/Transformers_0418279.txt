Al A LEGEND appears: “ONE MILLION YEARS BEFORE THE DAWN OF MAN...” Al

Sunlight begins to creep onto the screen, revealing a STRANGE
SYMBOL. Like a complex glyph. Slowly, we WIDEN to reveal...

It’s one of MANY. Etched onto a metallic surface. The symbols
can only have come from an ALIEN CIVILIZATION.

We hear a VOICE: powerful, noble. Though we don’t know $t yét,
it’s the voice of OPTIMUS PRIME: :

OPTIMUS (V.O.)
Our planet was destroyed by the ravages
of war... a war waged between the legions.
who worship chaos, and those of us ho
follow freedom...

As the light grows, it illuminates an IMMENSE:SQUARE MASS. A
CUBE. Covered by the symbols. Hurtling thr@w&h SPACE...

OPTIMUS (V.0.) CONT'D)

We battled for rule of a stfpgerit power...
The Energon Cube. Its origin is unknown
to us, yet it bears the igfe.force that
created our race... we fought until our
world was awash ip death, antil the very
ground swallowed those aur once-mighty
cities... and the cube was lost to the
limitless starg,..

The cube plunges into an Q@STERBIDAL GROUPING and ever-so-~
slightly NICKS one of the Ragks, bounces in a new direction:

OPTIMUS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Then, by Mertwne or fate, its course was
altered, DF@wn to a planet called...
‘Earth.’

REVEAL -- in the di8tance -- a familiar blue marble. The cube
SCREAMS past wéy, recketing toward our planet...

: * OPTIMUS (V.O.) (CONT'D).
We have searched for the cube across
Seserts of time, hoping to find it before
whe dark legions... but as fate would
have it, we were already too late.

SLAM TOSSEACK, as that ominous note CRESCENDOS. FADE TO:
1 BX@,. ARCTIC CIRCLE - TWILIGHT 1

SOARING over icebergs... we find a DERELICT SAILING VESSEL,
lilting, trapped in ice. The CREW works desperately to free the
ship, axes SLAMMING.

LEGEND: “NATIONAL ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION... 1897.”
060228 PRIME DIRECTIVE TO DW & HODs 2.

The SHIP’S CAPTAIN moves along his men:

CAPTAIN
Put your backs into it, or we’ll be
chopping our way back to The States!

The PACK HUSKIES start HOWLING at the snowscape:

SAILOR #1
There’s something out there...

The dogs suddenly BOLT OFF. The Captain grabs his RTMBE and
LANTERN and shouts for TWO MEN to follow.

EXT. ELSEWHERE ON THE ICE - TWILIGHT

The dogs lead the men over the ARCTIC SHELF, jumping from floe
to floe. They finally STOP, pawing at a va of snow.

SAILOR #2.
Whatever it is, it's below the-ice.

CAPTAIN
Nothing’s alive below the yce...

Suddenly a HUGE RIFT OPENS, lke téetonic plates shifting —- the
sailors DIVE to safety but one @f #he DOGS falls through! The
Captain GRABS for it but they? ke SUCKED into a 30 FT. FISSURE --

INT. ICE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Man and dog SHOOT down the fissure, LANDING HARD on something.
His lantern CRACKS bekow, kerosene fire casts FLICKERING SHADOWS
across the ice walls. ..Thé dog WHIMPERS. The men SHOUT from
above. Dazed, the eyptefn gets his bearings, calls back:

CAPTAIN
I’m~¢kay, Lads!

Suddenly ne a, we PULL BACK to find he’s standing on...
THE PALM OR, TS L - Half in, half out of the ice.
A MECHAN@TIL FACE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE ICE WALL, EXPRESSION

FROZEN IX.A SCREAM!

The Captaén can’t believe what he’s seeing... wipes away ice to
reveal a SYMBOL on the mechanoid:

THE “DECEPTICON” EMBLEM
Mesmerized, the captain pulls out a PICK-AXE. Starts CHOPPING

away at the ice to get a better look -- WHACK, WHACK -- the ice
CRACKS, TRIGGERING SOMETHING on the robot’s chassis:
060228 PRIME DIRECTIVE TO DW & HODs 3.

A LASER BLAST sears the captain’s eyes -- for a millisecond
FLASH, he sees THE SAME ALIEN SYMBOLS WE SAW ON THE CUBE,

coursing with phosphorous light!

The captain SCREAMS clutching his eyes, the dog BARKING MADLY --
the spectacles go flying and CRACK as they hit the floor ~—

SAILOR #2
CAPTAIN?! CAPTAIN!

THE CAPTAIN, TREMBLING, ON HIS KNEES, TURNS TO US - , PUP.
HAVE TURNED COMPLETELY WHITE

His hands scramble for the spectacles but he realzges... HE’S
IND! FIRE reflects through now-cracked glad@sai,’and something
INCREDIBLE is revealed in them as we PUSH CLO@SR.~. MICRO-CLOSE:

THE IEN CODE HAS BEEN SEARED IN! THE IL,

The frame is overtaken by WHITENESS... at #¥st we think it’s

FIGUEROA
Fly Boys have special privileges, Air

LENNOX
Hell yeah, cause unlike Army, we can
actually count past ten and understandr
the nuances of a point spread.

The Army boys shout a collective, playful “HO@AH4” One of the
local workers, a 13 year old Bedouin boy named. MABFOUZ, sees
Lennox and runs over eager]

The roof is RIPPED OFF by the unseen giant! Its MagsT¥a”HAND
tears up cables connected to the Cray computers -« tif cables
COME ALIVE, wrapping like magnetic vines around Morf4x's metal

THE WATCH COMMANDER pulls himself from rubbler sees FRITZING
MONITORS rapidly flashing a file that UPLOAB® §NTO THE ROBOT:

“PROJECT ICE MAN: ABOVE TOP SECRET: SECTOR QEVEN ACCESS ONLY”

Panicked, the Watch Commander looks ug through the shredded roof
at the beast, yells to a TECHIE:

VORTEX’S POV WHITES OUT. As it recovers, something DISENGAGES

makes it hard to see, we catch GLIMPSES of its features:

SAM WITWICKY: an endearing face that wants omy to fit in.
sitting at the back of the class, he stage} wmoonily at a GIRL
across the room:

MIKAELA BANES, a classic beauty, the : le of his eye.
Unfortunately, she’s sitting with 63» friend: TRENT DeMARCO,
your basic Abercrombie nightmare.

The teacher, MR. HOSNEY (bore@, @ver it), calls out:

Mia HOSNEY
‘kay, Sam, yore wp.

His pal MILES snaps fingerseag Sam’s eyes, breaking his trance:

* MILES
Dude. Earén. Now.

Sam rises, gathers"nis fackpack... makes the long, long "walk of
shame” to the heat otwthe classroom -- enduring giggles and
people THROWING®galI@d-up paper at him.

SAM -
Onpeswo... for my family genealogy report,
icked my great, great grandfather,
eibtsin Archibald Witwicky, one of the
Jirst guys ever to make it to the arctic

circle.

He turns¥ opens his backpack. Trent slingshots a GUMMY WORM --
it sticks in Sam’s hair.

MIKAELA
Quit it.

TRENT
(innocent shrug)

-- what?
060228 PRIME DIRECTIVE TO DW & HODs 11.

Sam picks the worm from his hair, trying to maintain composure:

SAM
Ah, cherry. My favorite.

He lays out his great grandfather’s NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS —-
among them, we favor the SPECTACLES we saw in the ice cawd:

SAM (CONT'D)

So, like, here are some of the tools of 4
nineteenth century seaman:

{people GIGGLE; he’s

self-aware now)
The quadrant, the sextant...

(more GIGGLES... he

pushes through)
The compass... and his glasses.

MR. HOSNEY
It isn’t ‘Show And Tell,’ Mr. Witwicky,
it’s the eleventh grade.

SAM
Yeah, I know, it’s just that I’m also
selling this stuff on F@key to put toward
my car fund? ghey ers, really cool
Christmas gifts, la®le at a low, low
price--

MR. AOSNEY
Sam --

SAM
Right, anyway I guess years of
hypothewmia rroze his brain, and he ended
up going bl#nd and crazy ina
sanitetiuy... drawing. these weird symbols
and ®abb¥ing about a giant ice man.

Sam holds up a 4tatied NEWSPAPER CLIPPING, circa 1897: “ARCTIC

ADVENTURER ies ICR_an FOUND!” Beneath it we see a PHOTO of
CAPTAIN ARCRRBBALD WITWICKY -- our ship’s captain. And next to
that, cra#de%y drawn sketches of the ALIEN SYMBOLS he saw.

The RELL RINGS. The kids flood out the door...

MR. HOSNEY
Thank you, everyone. Might be a pop quiz
tomorrow. Might not. Sleep in fear
tonight. Bye.
(to Sam)
Saved by the bell.

SAM
So... what’s my grade?

060228 PRIME DIRECTIVE TO DW & HODs 12.

MR. HOSNEY
I’d say a solid B minus.

SAM
Bminus?!! What about all the visual
aids?

MR. HOSNEY

Wasn't really feeling it.

SAM
No, um, you don’t get it -- see that Tran,
sitting in the car?

Sam points out the window: there’s a MAN in a €ag. out front --

SAM (CONT'D)
That's my dad -- and when I turned”
sixteen last year, he said if ¥maved two
thousand bucks and got three Bs he'd
help me buy half a car. YJ feervat least

KELLER

Afternoon everyone. I’m John Keller,
obviously you're wondering why you’re
here. So, these are the facts: at oh-
nine-hundred yesterday, the SOCCENT
Forward Operations Base in Qatar was
attacked. There were no survivors.

(everyone's shocked)
The world’s gonna hear about it in a half
hour, you're hearing now. The objective
of the attack was to hack our military
network -- we aren’t sure exactly what
they were after, but we do know they were
cut off during the assault... whichle&ds
us to assume they’l] try again. NS Shes
claimed responsibility, and so far“#ur
only real lead is this:

A SOUND emanates from speakers: the soi mela SHRIEK we
heard from Vortex during the SOCCENT att

KELLER (CONn®'D)

That's the signal that Méyxe™ our

shown considerable@abwiity in the area of

KELLER (CONT'D)
am told you used to run great guns at
NSA... til you were fired for twice
rewriting your superiors’ conclusions.

MAGGIE
Sir, about that? I have a slight problem
with impulse control. Like I probably
shouldn't tell you that’s an ugly tie and
