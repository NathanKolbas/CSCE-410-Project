THE TATTOO

 

of
THE GIRL
from

WATER'S END
A TITLE CARD:

The Warming Age began after the Great Thaw of the Cold War.
Free markets heated up and the ice caps slowly melted,
Little by little, the globe became one seamless ocean.

The survivors scavenged rafts, buoys, anything that could float.
As hope of finding Water's End slowly faded,
sweet water became scarce and the wars began anew.

FADE IN:
THE EARTH

The round blue planet as seen from space. A familiar image, but
something about it is different. There are no continents. No
land whatsoever. Only water. Nothing but water.

WE BEGIN MOVING in on the blue globe. Descending into it, as if
on a spaceship. Closer and closer. Now the screen is filled
with blueness.

DISSOLVE TO:

THE OCEAN

A sweeping panorama of waves kissed by the golden halo of

sunrise. Sublime and balmy. Not a vessel in sight. WE BEGIN
to pan along the gently curving horizon. Empty ocean in every
direction. Now, at the end of our 360° pan, we finally REVEAL:

“OASIS.”

A floating comminity. Several dozen vessels of all shapes and
sizes tied together -- bow to stern -- ina large ring. They
are connected by planks and bridges.

WE MOVE CLOSER. There are boats of every description -- tugs,
trawlers, Chinese junks, river barges. Most are simply
“houseboats" for the various families, but others seem to be
rigged for communal needs like the “Barterboat" with its
electricity-generating windmill, the "Schoolboat" which doubles
as a chapel, and the "Vegetable Barge,“ where rows of bizarre-
looking hybrid seaweed are growing in special hydroponic tanks.

IN THE WATER - NEAR A SLOOP.

An angelic, though impish GIRL of twelve is scraping barnacles
from the hull, collecting them in a basket. This is ENOLA. She
grabs a fat one and sucks out the meat.

VOICE
Enola... lunchtime!

HELEN, a striking if somewhat intense young woman in her late
twenties, approaches the rail and looks down at Enola in the
water.
HELEN
I made a kelp salad.

CONTINUED:
(CONT. }

ENOLA
We always have kelp salad.

HELEN
It's good for you.

ENOLA
I'm not hungry.

HELEN
Have you been eating those barnacles
again? Those are for later. Come on,
dolphin.

Enola makes a face and climbs up the rope ladder with her basket
of barmacies. Helen has set the table under a canopy with clam
shells and other scavenged china. She dries off Enola with a
towel and begins to oil her body with whale blubber. Enola is
squirming and fidgeting.
HELEN
Stop that. Do you want to turn red
like a lobster?

Helen takes some flesh colored-powder from a small urn and mixes
it with the 011, making a paste. She begins to apply the paste

to Enola's left shoulder, concealing a a small-round tattoo. It
is crescent-shaped with a triangular nick in the concave are. -

ENOLA
Why do you have to do that every time?
I like to see it.

HELEN
So does every trader that ever drifted
past us. I don't want you looking
different from any other kid. Besides,
it keeps it from fading.

ENOLA
It doesn’t mean anything, anyway.

HELEN
Someday you'll remember...

Just then, Enola notices something bounce over the rail onto the
deck -- is that a flying fish? No, wait... it's walking over to
her. Her jaw drops, eyes go wide.

ENOLA
Look! t
Helen glances over -- it's a bird!
HELEN

Oh, my God. It can't be...

They move over towards the bird which COOS nervously and backs
away. Helen reaches out smoothly and picks it up.
CONTINUED:
(CONT. )

HELEN
Do you remember ever seeing one?

ENOLA
I've seen them in my dreams.

They smile at each cther. Just then, a LOUD GONG resounds three
times across the water. Helen's expression becomes grim.

THE LOOKOUT POST.

High up in the tallest crow’s nest, a LOOKOUT repeats the THREE
GONG warning, gazing out to sea with his spyglass.

LOOKOUT
{calling down)
APPROACHING FLEET!! EAST-SOUTH-EAST.

ON HELEN.

She grabs Enola's hand.

HELEN
Let's go.

AERIAL ANGLE.

A panoramic overview. WE SEE MEN and WOMEN of “Oasis”
scrambling into a well-rehearsed routine. Helen and Enola race ._
up-and-down across the planks that connect the boats towards a
central platform where many PEOPLE are gathering. A MAN is
passing out weapons. ANOTHER is rounding up the CHILDREN.

THE PLATFORM.

Helen approaches a tough-looking woman with short spiked hair.
This is ANGEL, her sister. Helen holds up the bird.

ANGEL
Jesus.

Other PEOPLE move in for a look, crowding around with stunned
expressions. TROY, a boy of sixteen, looks on in wonder

TROY
What's that??

HELEN
It's called a bird.

MAN
They swim through the air. We must be
near Water's End...that‘'s where those
things come from.

RODNEY, a nervous man with frightened eyes, pushes his way to
the front.

RODNEY
Great timing!! We're about to be
slaughtered...

CONTINUED:
(CONT. }

HELEN
Don’t say that! We have to win,
that's all. We can't let them find it
before us! How many times have we
rehearsed for this? We're gonna give
them the fight of their lives...

VOICE
Yeah!!
HELEN
That's right. We're tough...
(holds up the bird)
And now we have some extra incentive!!

Everybody CHEERS, waving their guns and makeshift weapons.

ANGEL
Let's kick some pirate butt!!

CUT TO:
A FEW MILES AWAY.

The approaching fleet shoots ahead, full-throttle -- a mean
assembly of PIRATES on crafts of every description. The charge is
lead by MEN on attack aqua-cycles, their handle bars outfitted
with swivelling 25mm guns. Behind them in tight formation, is the
“INFANTRY,” a rabid assortment of KILLERS on motorized surf-boards
attached to cigarette boats. When the time comes, they'll
unbuckle their harnesses and shoot off solo. Then the “ARTILLERY,”
four matching swamp skiffs with out-rigged airplane props. Large
mortars are bolted to the foredecks. WATER-SKIERS are being towed
behind each boat. various deadly weapons dangling from their wet
suits. Finally, the *Cammand” Hovercraft brings up the rear.

CUT BACK TO:
“OASIS.*

SIMON, an ancient man of at least eighty, is leading the
CHILDREN into the hold of a trawler.

SIMON
No need to panic, now...
VOICE (0.S.}

Wait a minute!

It’s Angel. She walks up to Troy who looks scared.

ANGEL
You just turned sixteen, didn’t you,
kid?
TROY
(hesitant)
Yes.
ANGEL

You have to fight.

CONTINUED:
(CONT. )

Troy looks anxiously at Simon.

SIMON
Those are the rules, Troy.
ANGEL
Don’t worry. I‘1ll take care of him.
(to TROY)

Follow me,
CUT TO:

ANOTHER PART OF THE RING.

Helen races along hand-in-hand with Enola. They come the
“Vegetable-Barge” where Helen pulls an oil-drum out of a recess.
She lifts the lid and Enola:climbs inside the barrel. Helen
hands her the bird.
HELEN
Take the bird too. I don't want them
to find it.

Helen grabs an oxygen cannister and checks the valve. She puts
it in the barrel with Enola.

HELEN
It's set so you have air for an hour.
Don't touch the valve. If you
overpressurize, they might see the
bubbles.

ENOLA
You said we we're going to win. So
why do I have to hide?

A little tear begins to snake its way down Encla’s cheek.

HELEN
Go on, dolphin. Be brave.

She reaches inside a pouch and pulls out two circular glass
pendants. Clear crystal medallions, protected in leather
sleeves. Helen hands the smaller one to Enola.

HELEN
Remember these? Our lucky amulets.
As long as we wear them, we'll never
be separated, right?

ENOLA
(sadly)
Right.

Enola puts it around her neck. Helen does likewise. They hug.
Then Enola ducks inside the barrel. Helen secures the rubber
gaskets and the lid. She heaves the oil drum over the edge of
the barge. A thin nylon rope pays out as it sinks...

CUT TO:
THE PIRATES.

WE. ARE BACK in the thick of the attacking vessels, BLASTING
ahead at break-neck speed. The ROAR of the engines is
deafening. Whitewater splashes around us wildly. The PIRATES
are SCREAMING demonically as combat adrenaline surges through
their veins. A mile ahead, “Oasis” looks doomed...

CUT TO:
A SERIES OF CLOSE-SHOTS. PRE BATTLE-MONTAGE.

RODNEY is prepping one of the "defensive cannons." An old
relic, Spanish galleon style. He pours in some gunpowder and
loads the massive ball.

OTHER MEN AND WOMEN load. bullets into rusting revolvers.
Survival knives are strapped to thighs. Spear guns pumped up.

ANGEL and TROY have taken position on a barge. They are placing
the Molitov cocktails on the deck at even intervals.

ANGEL
You good with guns, kid?

TROY
I'm scared...
CUT TO:
THE PIRATE AQUA-CYCLES.

CAMERA is on the handle-bars of the lead bike, locking back at
the blood-thirsty mob. WE BOUNCE insanely as the cycle surges
over the waves and SMACKS down into the troughs.

CARLOS, the driver, CACKLES like a madman. He's the first
pirate we've seen close-up and HE IS SCARY!!!

Tribal style war-paint smeared across his face. A pierced nose
with a large fish-bone. His hair, a shock of blue, flying back
like satanic flames. On his forehead, a self-inflicted
triangular scar. And his eyes. They are beyond description. A
quasi-primordial post-punk. -

CUT TO:
A HOUSEBOAT

Helen straps a flame thrower onto her shoulders. She crouches
beside the outside rail and looks out towards the approaching
horde. Almost within range...

HELEN
Come on, you bastards...

AERIAL ANGLE.
The pirate vessels surround “Oasis" and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!!!

The "ARTILLERY" mortars bombard the flotilla with cover smoke.
“SURFERS* peel off from the cigarette boats and BLAST through
the smoke, FIRING at everything in sight!!

CONTINUED:
(CONT. }

RODNEY tries to aim his cannon but is blinded by the smoke-
screen, Before he can react, a SURFER bursts through with a
lasso. Rodney hurries to intercept him...

IN THE WATER.

The skimmers kick into full gear, sending the PARA-SAILERS high
into the air. They spray down bullets, picking off the
defenders like flies. Next, the DRIVERS cut their engines and
PARA-SAILERS glide down onto the defenseless ring-boats.

ON THE BARGE.

Troy cowers below the rail, trembling uncontrollably. Bullets
RICOCHET and splinter the wood like shrapnel. Angel is hidden
behind some barrels. A PARA-SAILER comes gliding down out of

the sky. Angel jumps up and nails him with her machete. She

tosses Troy a flint striker.

ANGEL
Come on, kid. Get the fireworks
going!
UNDERWATER, IN THE BARREL.

It is perfectly quiet and womb-like, but Enola is clearly
apprehensive. She clutches her glass pendant and shuts her
eyes, petting the nervous bird..

MEANWHILE, ABOVE.

MEN AND WOMEN exchange FIRE with the PIRATES. They are heavily
outnumbered, outgunned. Many of the boats have already been
boarded.

ON TEE BARGE.

TROY strikes the flint and lights one of the bombs. He lobs it
out at a passing cigarette boat and ducks as...

BOOOMI!!

A colossal fireball surges upwards. Angel gives him the thumbs
up. Troy looks at her in terror. That's what those things do?

ON THE HOUSEBOAT.

A WATER-SKIER is headed straight towards Helen. She pulls the
trigger of the flame thrower...

..-nothing!

The WATER-SKIER takes aim. Helen bangs her tanks. Is she out
of gasoline?

Suddenly, a STREAM OF FLAME bursts out of the nozzle, knocking
her backward. The skier catches fire, SCREAMING in agony, as he
continues to he dragged along like a FLAMING COMET...

CONTINUED:

oy
(CONT. }

..-Helen starts to get back to her feet, but doesn't notice,
behind her...

...A LARGE PIRATE CLOSING INI!! It's Carlos. Ina flash, he
grabs her by the arm and whips a large scythe around her throat.

Helen instinctively resists but he presses the blade against the
flesh, drawing a trickle of blood...

CARLOS
You wanna die? .

She stops moving, He paws her breasts with a vicious smile.
Helen's eyes falter. Suddenly, she swoons, fainting. He
reaches for her...

...BUT SHE'S FAKING!!! Helen spins around and SLAMS him with
her gasoline tanks. He sprawls across the deck and Helen turns
to barbecue him, but the trigger is stuck again!!!

He leaps to his feet and charges with his razor sharp scythe.
Helen ducks the first blow by inches...but the return swing,
gorges her in the gut!!! Her eyes go wide with shock as she
grabs her bleeding stomach with her hand. Carlos prepares for
the final blow -- decapitation...

SLOW MOTION NOW: The scythe slicing the air. Helen hesitating.
It's all or nething. The lethal blade. cCarlos's eyes. Helen
surges. Intercepts it with the flame-thrower nozzle. CLANG!!!!
AS metal scrapes metal...

She dives backwards, over the rail. Into the water. Agony in
her face, as salt-water finds the wound...

Slow motion, UNDERWATER SCREEEEAAAMMMMM! !!!

 

DISSOLVE TO:
TWENTY MINUTES LATER.

The battle is over. A massacre. All the SURVIVORS have been
rounded up on the “Vegetable barge. They are huddled together,
shivering quietly, separated into two groups -- WOMEN and YOUNG
BOYS on one side; MEN, INFANTS and OLD PEOPLE on the other.
Several PIRATES guard them with automatic weapons.

The bounty -- jugs and barrels of fresh water, desalinization
units, solar distillers, nautical instruments, weapons,
gasoline, dried food and so on -- is arranged in neat rows. A
mean-looking ROGUE is inspecting it. He is DIBTER -- his left
hand has been replaced by prosthetic metallic pincers.

Angel whispers to a WOMAN, standing beside her.

ANGEL
You seen my sister?

She shakes his head. Angel turns to look at the group of “MEN"
prisoners. She makes eye contact with Troy, who's been
sequestered with them. He looks petrified.

CONTINUED:
9,
(CONT. )

The “Command Hovercraft" eases up to the dock. TWO THUGS jump
to secure the stern and bow lines. The large, verticai-hinged
door swings open with a THUD! A FIGURE emerges...

Huge. Six-eight at least. Hip length hair. yellow. Not
blonde, balloon yellow. He has a solid-gold triangle attached
to his forehead. And his cape -- it's a dense mesh of bird
feathers! Meet LAZLO, "Lord of Pirates."

A YOUNG MAN rushes up to meet him. He's HELMUT, also unique in
appearance -- one of his eyes is blue, the other green.

HELMUT
They must have hidden her.
LAZLO
{ominous smile)
Don't worry...

MEANWHILE, IN THE BARREL.
Enola is PANTING, out of breath. The bird COOS nervously and
flaps its wings. She looks at the the oxygen cannister.

INSERT - THE GAUGE is nearing the red "DANGER ZONE"...

BACK ON THE PLATFORM.
Lazlo moves forward and addresses the prisoners.

LAZLO
Take me to your leader.

No one speaks. Lazlo surveys the faces before him.

SIMON
We have no leader. It’s a round table
democracy.

LAZLO
Spoken like a leader. .

Lazlo yanks him away from the others. The crowd reacts with
concern as Lazlo manhandles the old man.

LAZLO
Your people are very loyal. This is
good. Above all, a leader need
loyalty, no? Let me show you...
(to HELMUT)
A torch.

Helmut douses a torch with some gasoline and lights it witha
flint striker. He marches up to Lazlo, awaiting instructions.

LAZLO
Your hand, please.

Helmut nods grimly. Then, without hesitation, puts his hand in
the flame. Hovering there, unflinching. He grits his teeth.

CONTINUED:
10.
(CONT. }

Lazio watches calmly. Helmit’s hand is blistering, he begins to
shake...
LAZLO
Thank you.

Helmut pulls back his hand and plunges it into the water. Lazio
turns back to Simon.
LAZLO
That is my son. What does that tell
you about me?

SIMON
(horrified)
You're a monster!

LAZLO
Exactly. Now...let's get to business.
We heard that you have a little girl
here. A little girl with a little
tattoo. I want her. Are you afraid
of death?

SIMON
You wouldn't kill an old man.

In the background, Rodney begins to tremble.

RODNEY
He’s going to kill us all, don’t you
see...

Suddenly, he breaks free from the others and dives off the
platform into the ocean. Immediately, several GUARDS pepper the
water with gunfire.

Carlos moves towards a submerged steel cage, floating alongside
one of the pirate boats. He yanks open a hinged doorway and
instantly a black SHARK FIN makes a beeline for the escaping
man, sucking out a “leash” of steel webbing. The water foams up
with blood. Carlos cranks a large winch to recoil the leash and
haul the thrashing shark “dog” back into its cage.

IN THE BARREL.

The gauge is near “EMPTY.” Enola begins to panic,
hyperventilate. She opens the valve all the way and BANGS the
metal drum with her fist...

UNDERWATER.

A small trickle of bubbles begin to ascend from the “escape”
valve of the barrel. WE FOLLOW them up to:

THE SURFACE.

BODIES are floating like logs in slicks of blood and oil. A
PIRATE is patroling in a kayak, jabbing the bodies with a
harpoon to make sure they’re dead. Will he notice the bubbles?

CONTINUED:

a
li.
(CONT. }

Suddenly, a BODY moves right in front of us! It’s Helen, she’s
“playing dead.“ Directly before her nose, a stream of bubbles

is frothing up to the surface. She sneaks a glance around and

makes a sudden decision. Holding her breath, diving...

UNDERWATER.

Helen follows the nylon cord down to the barrel. She BANGS a
signal om the lid. Then, works to remove the latches. The
first one opens. But the other two are stuck... rusted...

INSIDE THE BARREL.

Enola gasps for breath. She's suffocating... water begins
seeping in through the crack, filling the up the drum...

ON THE PLATFORM.

BLAMMM!!! Carlos has BLASTED away half of Simon’s head with a

pistol. Point blank. :
LAZLO

{to the PRISONERS)

Next volunteer, please...

UNDERWATER .

The second latch finally SNAPS open. Helen is running out of
breath. She pulls at the final latch with all her might, blue in
the face... .

ABOVE.
The pirate in the kayak has spotted the bubbles.
PIRATE
(pointing)

Over heret!

Several PIRATES converge on the adjacent platform.

BELOW. IN THE BARREL. .
Enola has passed out. The water level is up to her chin...

UNDERWATER.

The latch is still frozen shut. Suddenly, Helen feels herself
peing hoisted up! Someone‘s pulling the cord from above. Helen
looks up in a panic. She attacks the latch with renewed frenzy.

ABOVE.
Lazlo and others are gathered round, as Dieter pulls up the
barrel line. The barrel breaks the surface. Dieter wrenches
off the cover with his mechanical hand. Lazlo peers inside...
Just the bird... Lazio picks it up and crushes it in his fist in
disgust.
LAZLO
Save me the feathers.

CONTINUED:
12.
(CONT. )

Just then, there’s the sound of the Hovercraft ROARING to life.
Lazlo spins to see his boat ripping away from its mooring,
bursting through the flotilla towards the open sea... it BLASTS
right through a bamboo-thatched boat, ripping it in two.

ANGEL
Thataway, Helen!

Immediately, several pirates pile into their cigarette boats and
peel off in pursuit.
LAZLO
(to HELMUT)
Let‘s move out.

Helmut directs the guards to escort the women and children
prisoners towards a souped-up pirate trawler. The men and other
“rejects remain on the platform, guarded by sentries. Angel
suddenly. breaks ranks and grabs Troy from the "man" group which -
seems to be staying behind.

GUARD

Hey!
ANGEL

He's thirteen! He's a kid!
TROY

(nervous whisper)
What are you doing?

ANGEL
dust keep quiet...

Meanwhile, OTHER PIRATES begin to load the bounty -- water, gas
and so on -- onto the slower boats.

CuT TO
THE DISTANT HOVERCRAFT

BLASTING ahead full-throttle. It's definitely fast enough, but
will they have enough fuel? Three cigarette boats lag in the
distance.

CUT BACK TO
“OASIS"

Everything stowed, the last of the pirate boats peel off. The
“rejected" men watch, unsure, as the pirates retreat. The
"prisoner" boat begins to pull away. Women and children watch
their mates/fathers receding -- will they ever see them again?
Troy looks at Angel.
TROY
Why did you do that? We’re prisoners.

ANGEL
Shhh...

With all the pirate vessels at a safe distance from the platform
of "rejected" men, Lazlo turns back with a bazooka...

CONTINUED:
43.
(CON TL.)

The men don't even have time for prayers before...
THE ENTIRE PLATFORM EXPLODES!!!
Troy looks back in horror from the stern deck of the “prisoner”

trawler. All the men of "Oasis" killed in an instantitt It
could have been him. Angel puts her arm around Troy’s shoulder.
CuT To:

INSIDE THE HOVERCRAFT.

WE ARE at the bridge, but no one is at the helm! It has been
lashed down amidships. WE NOTICE Helen's flame thrower aimed
sternward towards the fuel tanks. The trigger is tied in the
firing position. Malfunction or not, sooner or later it will...

EXPLODE!!1!!! The Hovercraft rips apart in a MASSIVE FIREBALL!!!

Lazlo and Helmut approach the smouldering wreckage on a

cigarette boat.
LAZLO

(rage)
My boat!
HELMUT
So much for the girl from water's End.

FADE TO BLACK: ©
FADE IN:

BERMUDA SHORTS.

Someone’s crotch in a pair of well worn khakis. The large
survival knife sheathed over his left hip looks like it has
recently tasted blood. He moves to unfasten his fly -- his
hands, coarse and dehydrated. A manicurist's nightmare.

A BEAKER.

Fills up with his urine. Pale yellow. No overdose of vitamins
in this sample. Last few drops. He's done, reaching in to grab
the beaker.

A PLASTIC FUNNEL.

The top of some kind of contraption. A large, translucent
funnel connected to a rubber hose which weaves down through a
series of valves and filters.

He pours the urine into the machine and WE FOLLOW its progress
downwards -~ through a paper filter, along a glass tube, down a
rubber hose. Suddenly, WE COME to something organic in the
chain -- a large, slimy, steaming KIDNEY!!!

The organ pulses with the flow of liquid. Processing it,
pumping it out into the mechanical remainder of the contraption
which concludes in a copper faucet. Somehow, a living, organic
kidney has been incorporated into this bizarre chain. But those
familiar with anatomy will notice that it is backwards -- the
urine is being forced into the wrong end of the kidney.

CONTINUED:
ia.
(CONT. }

Indeed, he places the beaker under the faucet and opens the
spigot. Out rushes clean, pure H20!! He's reversed the
excretion process, turned urine into water!!!

As he puts the beaker to his mouth and swigs it back in one
gulp, WE SEE his face for the first time -- rugged,
weatherbeaten. No sentimentality here. This is MORGAN, a
drifter in his early 40's.

Morgan puts down the beaker and raises a pair of binoculars to
his eyes.

BINOCULAR POV.

A faint column of smoke rising several miles away on the
horizon. His destination.

WIDE SHOT.

WE SEE his vessel. A river-barge modified to fly a sail. Two
cannons on either side, a rack of weapons, strands of kelp
drying on shelves, barrels of water. The boat's name is faded,
barely legible -- the “Miranda.” WE NOTICE something bizarre
pacing on the deck -- a magnificent white stallion!!

In the distance, the burning wreckage appears closer, but still
not distinct. Morgan adjusts his rudder slightly, trims his
sail. Morgan moves to the center of the deck where a series of -
oil drums are strapped together.

INSERT - THE BARRELS.

They are labeled "H20." Morgan opens the lid of one but instead
of water, it's packed full of dynamite. There's a jerry-rigged
trigger -- a wire filament attached to a flint striker. Morgan
secures it to the lid and gingerly closes the barrel. It's a
booby-trap.

ON MORGAN .
Satisfied, he grabs a speargun and an oxygen cannister from a
locker. He takes another look with the binoculars.

POV.

Burning wreckage of a flotilla. The aftermath of battle. He
PANS south, checking the horizon... Whoah. What’s that? A
small motor-sailer bearing down on his opportunity! It's
another drifter, also looking to scavenge from the wreckage...

MORGAN (0.S.)
Son of a bitch.
SMASH CUT TO:
A SPINNAKER.
Surging out of its sail bag. The rainbow colored nylon balloons
upwards with wind, as Morgan hoists up the halyard. He re-
checks his rival through the binoculars.

CONTINUED:
(CONT.}

MORGAN
Let’s see you beat that, pal!

There's a distant RUMBLE. Morgan cups his hands behind his ears
to hear better. An ENGINE...

MORGAN
God dam, asshole...

Be races inside the bridge.

THE BRIDGE.

Morgan rummages below the counter for a can of gasoline. He
swishes it around a few times. It's pretty low.

MORGAN
Shit.

He scrambles outside...

THE STERNDECK.

Morgan leads the horse to a rotating yoke. He harnesses it in,
SLAPS the horse’s rump. It begins walking round and round,
turning a gear which drives a jerry-rigged paddle wheel. Morgan
grabs the yoke and pushes alongside his horse. The sound of the
other guy’S ENGINE becomes tauntingly louder...

Morgan looks at his rival. They are converging from different
directions in a triangle. But his engine is at least five horse
power and Morgan’s only got the one horse. It’s hopeless...

But now the ENGINE SPUTTERS. COUGHS a few times, and dies.

He’s out of gas! :
MORGAN

(picking up his binoculars)

Serves you right. Gas-guzzling

stinkpot.

BINOCULAR POV. -

A scrawny guy. Looks hungry. Morgan PANS north. About two
hundred yards away, the wreckage is looking more promising.
It’s at least, two-dozen "ghost" boats, some burning, others
ransacked. No survivors.

WIDE ANGLE.

Morgan grabs an acoustic megaphone from the stern locker. He
moves to the port rail.
MORGAN
(thru megaphone)
AHOY DRIFTER!!! I CLAIM THIS FLOTSAM.
IF YOU APPROACH...I'LL KILL YOU. 1
REPEAT, KEEP AWAY UNTIL I HAVE SAILED.

DISSOLVE TO:
16.

AMID THE SMOKE. LATER.

WE ARE surrounded by floating debris. ‘The remains of a flotilla
in the typical "ring formation. The “Miranda” is drifting in
the oily “centerwater,” near a floating platform.

Morgan drags out another contraption. Some kind of slanted
rubber conveyer belt. He sets it up on the stern, angling it
into the water. Attaches the horse to another harness and the
belt begins to move. The oil and water travel up the tilted
belt, separating as they do. The heavier water slips back down
into the sea, the more viscous oil sticks to the rubber and
moves up the belt until it falls over the lip into a container
that Morgan has set up. He's skimming oil.

Morgan glances at the other drifter who waits patiently, sails
lowered, about fifty yards away. He grabs his speargun and
leaps onto the nearby platform, tying down his barge with a
loose line. Leaving his horse to continue skimming...

Morgan looks around at the ring of "ghost" vessels. WIND
WHISTLES through large holes in the hulls, gorged by stray
artillery shells. A bridge door BANGS open and closed, hanging
from one hinge. In the distance, a windmill power genny SQUEAKS
round and round -- WE RECOGNIZE this from “Oasis.” Morgan
focuses his gaze on a severely charred platform across the way,
all but burnt to a crisp. That's where he wants to go.

He begins to make his way from ship to ship. They've been
stripped clean of every conceivable scrap. Ne'er a cleat remains.
Even the decking has been ripped up for scavenged lumber.

THE BURNT PLATFORM.

Morgan boards it with a grim expression. Amid the charcoal
timbers...are roasted human remains!! Morgan picks up a skull
with cool detachment. Still plenty of flesh -- this was recent.
He drops the skull, looks around for clues. Something catches
his eye. He kneels down, picks it up -- a feather!!

A feather attached to a fragment of cloth. Morgan stares at it,
an intense expression. Unblinking, his eyes speak volumes.

SMASH CUT TO:
A BOY

About four-years old. Somewhere else, another time. He's found
a bird. One of his eyes is green, one is blue. He holds up the
bird. A big smile.
BOY
Daddy, look! An an-im-al!!
BACK TO:

MORGAN.
Thinking, staring at the feather...

There is a THUD. Morgan spins. It‘s the other drifter, boarding
the platform behind him. -

(CONT. }

MORGAN
That little fucker!!

Morgan races to intercept him. The drifter drops his rope
sheepishly. He's emaciated. Looks like he hasn't eaten in
weeks.
MORGAN
Listen, stranger. I gave you fair
warning. I kill people who cross me.
You got it?

Morgan COCKS his gun for emphasis. The drifter nods
diminutively. He's too weak to speak.

MORGAN
You ain't gonna find nothing to eat
here. Unless you're a cannibal and
you like it well-done.

DRIFTER
Any...thing...

Morgan looks at him for a moment.

MORGAN
This was recent. You see them sail?

The drifter can’t stand it any longer. He's salivating...
DRIFTER
Please...
MORGAN

Which direction??
The drifter points weakly.

MORGAN
East??

DRIFTER
Oil...trail...

Morgan looks where he pointed. Sure enough, there's a narrow
slick of oil receding into the distance. One of the pirate
boats must have been leaking. Morgan turms back to the drifter.

MORGAN
O.K., pal. Dig in.

The drifter dives down, grabs a bone and attacks it.

MORGAN
Don’t eat too fast. You'll get sick.

DISSOLVE TO:
DUSK.

Morgan is at the bow of the "Miranda." In the background, WE
SEE the remains of "Oasis" receding in his wake...

(CONT. }

He's got an old rag wrapped around a stick in one hand, a compass
in the other. He dips the rag in gasoline, lights it witha
flint striker. Tosses the burning torch ahead in the water.
Suddenly, the “oil-trail" ignites and shoots an arrow of flame
along the floating bead towards the horizon. It's like a comet.

Morgan checks his compass -- East-South-#ast.
DISSOLVE TO:

LAZLO.

Addressing an assembly. It's night and as he speaks WE PULL
BACK REVEALING more and more details of the pirate encampment.

LAZLO
It’s an imperfect world, gentlemen.
There will always be strength and
weakness.

Lazlo is seated on his throne platform. Around him, stand
Helmut, Carlos and Dieter. Above them, is a massive water
tower, the central node of the pirate flotilla...

LAZLO (Cont'd)
Why not be on the side of strength?
We offer you an opportunity here, a
last chance for redemption. You're at
an age where you can still choose your
own path...

Huge hose spill down from the tower reservoir, like gigantic
umbilical cords, sucking up fresh water from pirate vessels that
have docked to unload the latest bounty...

LAZLO (Cont'd)
Resistance takes so mich effort. And
what's the point? No one will ever
defeat us. You know that in your
hearts.

Behind Lazio, the sheer magnitude of the pirate flotilla is
becoming evident. Hundreds of boats -- the best and fastest --
berthed in a haphazard "town" of several acres. Gaslights burn
in many vessels, and shadowy FIGURES stumble across the planks
from boat to boat, bottles in hand. The sound of LAUGHTER,
MUSIC and GENERAL DEBAUCHERY.

LAZLO (Cont'd)
Look around you, my sons. You could
be part of this. And loyalty is so
effortless. "Do what you're told.”
What could be simpler?

WE HAVE PULLED BACK enough to reveal the people Lazlo is
addressing. Several dozen YOUNG BOYS -- the one's from “Oasis" --
standing in a triangular formation. But their appearance has
changed. They have been "branded" with the pirate triangle in
their forehead. Their faces are streaked with warpaint.

CONTINUED:
ig.
(CONT. }

Troy is standing at the peak of the triangle, facing Lazlo
directly. lLazlo looks right at him.

LAZLO
I offer this to you -- the chance to
be one of us. Part of our family...
I have a dream for us, gentlemen.
That when we find Water's End...and we
will find it first... that it becomes
a place of strength. I see no room
for sickness there, for disease, the
crippled, the enfeebled. Just
strength... perfect physical
specimens, perfect discipline, pure
strength. Do you have it in you to be
part of this dream? This is the final
Question.

Lazlo stands up.
LAZLO
My sons will supervise your training.

He leaves. Dieter moves towards the boys.

DIETER
It's pretty simple. Bend or break.
You either join us or die. Carlos
teaches you how to fight. If you
survive his little seminar, you'll be
half-way there.

Helmut makes eye-contact with Troy who looks utterly petrified.
He moves closer to him at the top of the triangle.

HELMUT
(so only TROY can hear)
I was standing there, once. It's not
so bad.
CUT TO:

THE "MIRANDA."

Morgan is taking a noon-sighting with his sextant. He marks his
position on a featureless map. Grabs his compass and spyglass
and moves towards the mast. He uncleats a line, hooks one end
to the horse's yoke. Puts his foot in a loop on the other end.
Morgan slaps the horse on the rump...it walks towards the stern,
hoisting Morgan up the mast. He checks his compass, looks out
with the spyglass. Nothing...

CUT TO:
SUNSET.

Morgan collects the strands of kelp drying on the racks. He
crumbles them up and puts them in a pail. Carries it over toa
trough and pours some out.

(CONT. )

MORGAN
(calling to his horse}
Dinnertime...

Morgan grabs a handful for himself and munches on it. He
carries his pail to the kelp locker and opens it up. He starts
to fill the bucket then notices something -- a long blonde hair!

Morgan holds it up. Almost indiscernible at first. Immediately,
he jumps to nis feet and races towards the bridge.

INSIDE.

He grabs his speargun, loads two bolts and pumps it up. He
unbuckles the sheath of his survival knife.

THE STERN.

One by one, he yanks open the lockers, thrusting the speargun
inside.. He's taking no chances as he works his way forward.

THE BOW.
The forward lockers seems to be in order. He checks the shadowy

recesses between pieces of machinery. There is a NOISE behind
him. He spins instantaneously, drawing his knife...

It's the horse...

Morgan hesitates. He leads his horse inside the bridge then re--
emerges. Night has almost fallen. Morgan rummages in a chest
for an old lantern. He shakes it to see if there is any
kerosene left and lights it with a flint-striker.

MEANWHILE. INSIDE.

WE ARE below the floor boards, looking upwards through the
cracks. A mysterious POV. The horse CLOMPS around directly
above us. Now WE SEE, Morgan entering the bridge. As he moves
around the cabin swiftly checking all the corners, WE CATCH
GLIMPSES of him through the cracks. Then, he disappears...

WE HEAR a board CREAKING. Where is he?? Suddenly, the planks
rip open above us. Morgan is glaring down at us, his weapons
drawn...

REVERSE ANGLE.
It is little Enola, cowering in a recess under the floorboards.
MORGAN

(growling)
Get out of there you little...

At that instant, Helen comes flying out of nowhere. She leaps
onto Morgan's back, looping a fish-line garotte around his neck.
Morgan thrashes backward. He lashes out with his knife but
Helen deftly avoids the blade, pulling the fish line with all
her might.

CONTINUED:
el.
(CONT. )

Morgan spins around trying to free himself with centrifugal
acceleration. His face is turning red with the build-up of
pressure. Helen BASHES against the sides of the the cabin as
they turn. An avalanche of fishing rods spill off a rack,
nautical instruments are flying everywhere.

The horse begins to shake its head and rear, slicing the air
with its hoofs. It kicks Morgan's arm, sending his knife
flying. It lands inches from Enola's nose as she climbs out of
her hiding place...

Helen is still choking Morgan with both hands. The speargun
FIRES, slamming a bolt into the starboard wall. Enola looks
around for a weapon. Helen can't hold on any longer. Still
weak from the pirate wound, she releases. Slumps to the ground.

ENOLA (0.S.)
STOP!!

She's got a revolver. Enola points it at Morgan with both hands.

ENOLA
Don't kill her! We don't want to hurt
you.

MORGAN
You could have fooled me...

It's a stand-off. Morgan has his speargun leveled at Helen's
forehead. Enola is pointing the revolver at Morgan's chest.
Helen clutches her side, wincing with pain...

MORGAN
{cool as death)
Drop it before I blow her face off...

Enola hesitates. She looks to Helen for advice but she is too
preoccupied with her own discomfort.

ENOLA
Drop yours first... .

Morgan presses the speargun barrel against Helen's skin.

MORGAN
Say goodbye...

ENOLA
(panicking)
Waitl! Wait...

She lowers her gun. Lets it drop at her feet.

ENOLA
Don't kill us, please. We were
attacked by pirates! They killed
everybody!1 We're the only survivors.

Morgan pulls his gun back. A beat. They stare at each other.

(CONT. }

ENOLA
She's wounded. Please help us...

MORGAN
(holding up the feather)
The man...was he wearing these?

HELEN
(weakly)
Yes...

Morgan thinks for a moment.

MORGAN
I unload you at the next flotilla.
Until then, you do what I say...when I
say it. You catch your own food and
you better start recycling your piss,
because I'm not sharing my hydro.
CUT TO:

THE NEXT MORNING.
Helen's on the berth. Enola changes the dressing on her wound.

HELEN
I'm fine. The salt water cauterized
it.

Morgan leans in the doorway and calls in to Enola.

MORGAN
Let's go, girl.
He SLAMS the door. Helen and Enola look at each other.

HELEN
Go on, dolphin. Everything will be
O.X. We still have our lucky amlets.

The glass pendants still hang from their necks.
CcuT TO:
THE DECK. DAY.

Enola is strapped up to the top of the mast as a “lookout".
Morgan calls up to her from below.

MORGAN
East-south-east.

ENOLA
I know...I know.

She looks through the spyglass.

ENOLA
Nothing.

Morgan hoists up a small green flag.

MORGAN
Tie that up there.
ENOLA
What does it mean?
MORGAN
Means I have something to trade.
ENOLA
What?
MORGAN
You.

Enola looks at him nervously.

MORGAN
Keep looking.

IN THE CABIN.

Helen is on lying on the berth, patching sails with scraps of
cloth. She hears the SOUNDS of Morgan moving about outside.
Helen strains to sit up straight and see what's going on outside
through a small window. But her mobility is severely limited.
She's obviously in a lot more pain than she let on.

Helen listens. Is he crossing to the stern? She notices a
small crack in the rear wall. Puts her eye to it.

POV THROUGH CRACK.

Morgan is rumaging through a locker. He moves out of view.
comes back. He has a rope. Reaches into a bin. Puils
something out... God, it's a skull!!

ON HELEN.

A look of horror. He's a cannibal!! Now he moves aside and
disappears. Helen thinks for a moment. Then, begins to drag
herself towards the door.

OUTSIDE, ON THE STERN.

Morgan looks at the skull for a moment. Still has a little
flesh. Pretty burnt though. He's not going to eat it, is he?
Our hero... Jesus.

Morgan grabs a steel wire, loops it through the eye sockets and
ties a boline to a thick nylon cable. He tosses the skull over
the stern rail, letting the line pay out. He's trawling for
sharks... whew!

MEANWHILE. ON THE BOW.
Helen calls up to Enola on the mast.

HELEN
Come down, quick. He's a killer!

CONTINUED:
24,
(CONT. )

She uncleats the line and starts to lower her, wincing with pain
from her wound.
MORGAN (0.S.)
Hey! Who said you could relieve her?

Helen turns. She grabs an oar, brandishing it as a weapon.

HRELEN
Stay back!

Morgan marches up menacingly. Enola is dangling half-way up the
mast.
MORGAN
Get your ass back up there. And keep
your eyes glued to the goddamn scope!

Helen swings the oar back and forth in warning.

HELEN
Hold it right there!

Morgan narrows his eyes. Just then, the entire boat jerks to
one side. Morgan races back towards the stern.

ENOLA
What is it?
HELEN
I don't know. Quick...
Helen lowers her down. The boat continues to shake...

THE STERN.

Morgan is fighting what mist be a mammoth shark. The line whips
from side to side, back and forth. Morgan cleats it to the
paddle-wheel. He and the horse begin to reel it in. Helen and
Enola come peeking around the corner, watching him...

He turns, netices them. Morgan tosses Helen the speargun.

MORGAN
You'll only get one shot. Make sure
it's in the brain.

He goes back to the paddle wheel, hauling in the monster shark,
now only thirty yards from the boat. Thrashing wildly, leaping
out of the water...it's a nasty-looking hammerhead.

ON HELEN.

She looks at the gun. Looks at Morgan facing away. Vulnerable.
The shark is almost within range... five yards and closing.
Helen raises the gun. Is she aiming at Morgan?

MORGAN
(turning)
Now!! .

CONTINUED:
25.
CONT.)

Helen hesitates... then swings the gun towards the shark and
nails him between the eyes. It goes limp. Morgan storms up to
Helen, grabs the gun and stares her in the eye.

MORGAN
Why the fuck did you wait?? A fish
that size could sink us!!

Helen is silent. Morgan turns to Enola.

MORGAN

Get back up in the crow's nest, girl.
ENOLA

My name's Enola.
MORGAN

Not to me.
cuT TO

THE CABIN. NIGHT.
Morgan has cooked a fish soup. He ladles out the bowls.

HELEN
(cautious)
Thanks for sharing your catch.

MORGAN
You helped.

He passes cut the bowls. But mola refuses.

ENOLA
I'm not hungry.

She gets ur and runs outside.

HELEN
Enola, come back here and finish your
dinner! Can you get her, please?

MORGAN
She'll be fine. Just wants some
attention.

Helen looks at him for a moment.

HELEN
You have kids?

MORGAN
A son. He’s dead.

Helen glance@s at the life-preserver, racked against the wall.
The ship name "MIRANDA" is stenciled on it.

HELEN
Was she your wife? Miranda...

Morgan turmcss to face her.

MORGAN
I don't like questions.
HELEN
Sorry.
MORGAN
You like talking about your husband?
HELEN
Enola never had a father. I adopted
her.
MORGAN
Too bad for you. Now you gotta keep
her alive.

CUT TO;
THE PIRATE CAMP.

Lazlo is seated on his thrown, surrounded by his sons. A
diminutive FIGURE cowers at his feet.

HELMUT
He was scavenging some burning flotsam
about a week ago. Said he noticed a
little girl and a woman sneak on to
another guy's boat.

LAZLO
Did she have a tattoo, drifter?

The figure raises his head slightly -- it's the emaciated
scavenger. He looks a little better, but not much.

, DRIFTER
I think so, yes.. Your Lordship. Uh...
respectfully... a little something for
my services. A pour-boire...

LAZLO
Give him a drink.

The drifter kisses Lazio's feet. Dieter yanks him to his feet
and marches him towards the edge of the platform. There's a
gigantic anchor, so huge it must have come from an ocean liner.
Tne drifter stares at it for a second, then his expression
becomes anxious. Before he can react, Dieter has clamped his
wrists into iron manacles chained to the anchor.

CARLOS
Big reward, huh?

He nudges the mammoth anchor in the water with a large lever.
The drifter looks down in a panic as the chain pays out at
lightning speed beside his feet. Then, in a flash, he is sucked
overboard, SCREAMING...

CUT TO:
27.

THE "MIRANDA." DAY,
Enola calls down from the crow's nest.

ENOLA
Look!

Morgan races up -- there's a flashing light on the horizon. Not
a signal. It's irregular, like sunlight reflecting off
something shiny. Morgan checks his compass. Just a few ticks
off East-South-East. It's gotta be them.

He lowers Enola down from the mast, intense expression.

MORGAN
(grabbing the scope)
Give me that... back off!

Enola retreats, bumping into something. She turns and jumps
with fright...

A big white nose...

She's come face-to-face with the horse, who shakes its head
good-naturedly. Enola stares at it, unsure of what to do. She
reaches out tentatively to touch it...

MORGAN
Hey! Stay away from him.
fnola looks him abruptly in the eye.

ENOLA
You just pretend to be mean. But I
know you really aren't. It's ‘cause
you're scared...
Morgan glares at her.

MORGAN
You don't know anything about me and
it's gonna stay that way. -

Enola sticks out her tongue at him. He ignores her, goes back
to the scope.

POV THROUGH SCOPE.

Magnified but still indistinct. Irregular flashing. Definitely
something manmade. Could certainly be a flotilla.

MORGAN.
Narrows his eyes. The adrenaline begins to surge.

MORGAN
Get your mother! I want you off this
boat.

ENOLA

What do you mean?
CONTINUED:
28.
(CONT...)

MORGAN
You Gdeaf?? The ride's over. Get out
of here! !

Enola races into the cabin. Morgan crosses to his booby-trap
barrel. Once again, he attaches the wire trigger to the hook on
the lid, Replaces it ever-so-lightly. What else? Spear gun...
oxygen tank...

Enola emerges from the cabin helping Helen who's still limping.

HELEN
I don't understand... you're just
going to toss us in the ocean?

Morgan's eyes look possessed.

MORGAN
You see this barrel? There's about
four hundred pounds of dynamite in it.
You wanna be here when they set it
off? No... didn't think so. So grab
a piece of wood, and get the fuck
overboard. This is goodbye, gang. It
was nice to know you...

HELEN
We wouldn't stand a chance out there.
ENOLA
You can't do that to us! She's still
hurt.
MORGAN

You don't get it, do you? I don't
give a shit about you.
Enola looks hurt.

HELEN
What about you? You're going down
with the ship.

MORGAN
And what if I am...

Enola has noticed something. She points eastward.
ENOLA
It's gone.
The flashing has stopped. Shadows suddenly disappear. Morgan
looks up at the sun. It's been obscured behind an enormous grey
cloud.

Morgan smelis the air. Strangely still -- the sail, motionless.
The sky turns silver... The horse NEIGHS nervously.

CONTINUED:
29.
(CONT. }

MORGAN
Goddamnit!! Move! Get inside and
secure everything...

They bolt. Morgan quickly straps in all his barreis. Lowers
the sail and lashes it down.

INSIDE.

Helen and Enola are busy stowing things in the lockers. Morgan
comes in with the horse. He clears one wall and straps the
horse against it with thick webbing. He tosses Helen some rope.

MORGAN
Tie yourself down. I'11 get her.

The winds begin to WHISTLE around the cabin. The barge rolls
with the growing swells. Enola climbs onto her berth and begins
to strap herself down. Morgan comes over to assist her.

ENOLA
(coldly)
I can do it myself.

THE OCEAN.

The winds are picking up fast. The tiny barge begins to look
dwarfed by the size of the waves. It rises up twenty feet with
the swells and CRASHES down into the troughs, spraying up
whitewater.

IN THE CABIN.

The small room begins to roll nauseatingly. The wind HOWLS
through the cracks. Morgan staggers over to a free wall and
ties himself against it.

The horse's tongue hangs down pathetically. Its eyes are
bulging...

Enola and Helen are tied to their berths and are moving in
tandem with the cabin which oscillates like a huge pendulum.
OUTSIDE.

It's a full gale now. The sky is deep gray. Wind hammers
incessantly inte the tiny vessel. Water sprays everywhere. The
mast soars wildly through the air like a conductor's baton.

IN THE CABIN

A locker BURSTS OPEN, sending an avalanche of cargo across the
room onto Helen, She winces, holding her forehead. Everything
is rocking like a see-saw. The NOISE is deafening.

Helen closes her eyes. An instant later, she is leaning over,
retching violently onto the floor. She opens her eyes,
resignedly.

CONTINUED:

(CONT. }

The horse WHINNIES in agony. It begins to buck and flail
against its straps.

CLOSE ON STRAPS -- The webbing is old. One edge begins to give,
ripping...

Enola is directly in line with the horse. She takes her glass
pendant off and holds it in both hands tight against her chest.
The horse is thrashing in the background. Suddenly, the straps
ripti! The horse comes crashing across the cabin, directly
towards Enola... she will be crushed!!!

At the last instant, the cabin shifts in the opposite direction,
sending the horse sidestepping away from her...

It SLAMS into another wall, ripping open several lockers.
Objects spill out and bounce around the cabin floor.

Morgan unties himself to secure the horse. Enola ioosens her
straps wisely as the cabin shifts again. The horse is coming
back... LOOK QUTI!!

Enola dives off her berth a nanosecond before the horse SMASHES
against it, crushing the planks like egg shelis...

Enola is on all fours. She's lost her pendant. Objects are
flying back and forth through the air. Helen SCREAMS above the
bediam.
HELEN
Get back to your berth!!

But Enola has spotted her pendant on the opposite side of the
cabin floor. She's crawling for it. The horse stumbles by
epileptically, stomping inches from Enola's hand.

OUTSIDE.

The mast is whipping back and forth with the relentless wind.
It bows at at unimaginable angle and SNAPS suddenly, SMASHING
into the cabin...

INSIDE.

The mast comes CRASHING through the cabin boards, gorging a
window-sized hole in the starboard wall. Morgan has managed to
get the horse and himself strapped down...

But now Exola's pendant slides across the floor towards the hole
in the starboard side. She starts to move for it.

HELEN
(screaming)
No, Enolai! Get back here!!

Emola is determined to retrieve her glass amulet. It's sliding
towards her now. She reaches. Inches from her fingers...

Now the boat rolls the other way and the pendant slides back
towards the hole in the wall...

(CONT. )

...stopping a hair short of slipping onto the deck. One more
roll and it'll be lost forever into the ocean. Enola races
across...
HELEN
Enola!! Don'tt!

Helen loosens her straps. She starts to sit up, but winces in
pain. Her belly wound is still raw... She hesitates.

The room rolls again and Enocla's pendant slides outside. She
leans out to reach for it. Suddenly, a flood of water sweeps
past and sucks Enola outside...

HELEN
NO!!!

ON MORGAN.
Looking at Helen, at the hole...

SMASH CUT TO:
THE YOUNG BOY.

SCREAMING. ..a hand clamps over his mouth. His green/blue eyes
darting back and forth.

WOMAN'S VOICE
DON'T TOUCH MY SON!! PLEASE...

A biade comes down. Blood splatters against the deck. A woman
lies dead, her throat slit...

ON MORGAN
An instant decision.

MORGAN
Stay where you are!! I'll get herti

WE ARE back in the present. Morgan rips off his straps and
moves quickly to the opening where Enola was swept away...

CUTSIDE THE HOLE.

He peers out into the raging torrent. The wind rips around the
boat, pounding it with water. No sign of Enola. Morgan ties a
rope around his waist and secures the other end to a post. He
dives blindly into the inky water...

THE OCEAN.

The water froths up like an gigantic washing machine. Morgan is
carried helplessly with waves.

MORGAN
(screaming)
Hey!! Girlit!

She is nowhere to be seen. Morgan's safety rope is stretched
taut to the limit. He calls out again, this time with her name.

MORGAN
ENOLA! !

VOICE
Here!

Another thirty yards out. He's going to have to untie himself.
But the imstant he does so, he is sucked away from her. He's
helpless against the unyielding wash...

Morgan spots the broken mast, floating to his left. It's his
only shot. It takes ali his strength to swim up to it. With
his last surge of energy, Morgan swings the mast towards Enola.
She grabs it, holding on for life... Morgan paddles against the
raging waves, guiding them back to the boat. One arm against
the titanic power of the ocean...

ON THE BOAT.

Helen is standing near the rail. She tosses out a life-
preserver on a guide line. It falis near Morgan but he relays
it to Enola. Helen pulls her on board. Enola coughs up
mouthfuls of water.

But now a great wave lifts the mast high into the air. It comes
SLAMMING Gown on Morgan. He goes under... Helen and Fnola stare
helplessly into the oceanic tumult for signs of Morgan.

ENOLA
Where is he??

HELEN
we lost him.

ENOLA

(crying)

He saved my life!! We have to help
him!

HELEN

We'll all drown that way...
Enola becomes HYSTERICAL.

HELEN
Stop it! There's nothing we can do!

Helen opens the door to the bridge cabin and guides Enola
inside, as she continues to struggle.

IN THE BRIDGE.

Enola is in shock, SCREAMING and flailing her arms. Helen
forces her onto the berth, starts tieing her down.

ENOLA
Waitt! Waitt!

HELEN
Quiet, Enola!

(CONT. )

Helen cups her hand over Enola's mouth. Enola seams to be
trying to say something, gesturing with her arm. Helen grabs
the arm and ties it down, ignoring her pleas.

ENOLA'S POV.

She can see a hand, struggling to claw it's way onto a purchase
through the starboard hole...

OUTSIDE.

Morgan is dangling from one arm off the starboard side of the
hull. Waves crash against him, challenging his grip...

INSIDE. -
The fingers slipping... will Helen notice?

ON ENOLA.
She wrenches her hand free and SLAPS Helen across the face.
ENOLA
(pointing)
The drifter!

Helen turns. She dives to help Morgan. Their hands come
together, locking at the wrists... she hauls him aboard.

DISSOLVE TO:
DEAD CALM.

Balmy, flat ocean. The devastated barge floats quietly in the
storm's aftermath. Morgan is busy resurrecting the mast. He's
harnessed the horse and they are hoisting it up with a thick
hemp cable. The green "trading" flag is still flying on the
masthead. Morgan's face goes red with the exertion. They've
got the mast to 60°. One last effort now...it's up! Morgan
lashes it in place.

INSIDE. .
Enola is lying alongside Helen on the berth. She is teary-eyed.

ENOLA
You said as long as we had them we'd
never be separated. What's going to
happen now?

HELEN
You can have mine, dolphin. It's just
as lucky.

Helen takes the amulet from around her neck and gives it to
Enola who looks at it dubiously.

ENOLA
What about you?

Morgan enters through the door and glares at them. He's out of
breath, a fountain of perspiration.

MORGAN
What are you doing? I told you to
clean out the bilge!

HELEN
She's still upset...

MORGAN
Upset? My boat's been wiped out! She
almost got us all killed over a stupid
pendant. Don't tempt met I've gota
bad side and you don't want to see it.

Morgan reaches out and pulls Enola from the berth.

MORGAN
Get to work!

But suddenly Helen grabs Morgan's wrist and yanks him down to
face her.
HELEN
Don't ever touch her like that again!

MORGAN
I make the rules around here!! You're
stowaways. I usually kill stowaways.

Enola begins to CRY.

HELEN
You're just a little pirate, aren't
you?

Morgan raises his arm to hit her, but restrains himself.

Enola has stopped crying but now is looking at Morgan with
terror in her eyes. Who is this man? Morgan stares back at
her.

CLOSE -- ENCLA'S EYES.

Full of suspicion.

MORGAN'S EYES.

Going withirc. Remembering...

HIS SON'S EYES.

Blue and green, smiling back at him.
ON MORGAN.

He softens. Impulsively, Morgan picks Enola up in his arms and
marches her outside. Helen moves to intercept him, but winces
with pain, clutching her bandaged wound.

THE DECK.

Enola holds on warily as Morgan carries her purposefully across
the deck. Where are they going? Overboard??

Morgan stops at the horse. He lifts Enola up and places her on
its back. Enola's expression goes through the following range:
terror, bewilderment, curiosity, intrigue, excitement, and joy,
all in about three seconds.

She begins to pet the horse's mane, looking cautiously towards
Morgan for approval. -
ENOLA
I knew you weren't mean,

Morgan half smiles.

ENOLA
You don't talk to people much, do you?
MORGAN
No.
ENOLA
What's your name?

MORGAN
I don't need a name.

She's on her feet, watching them from the doorway to the bridge.
Helen can't hear what they're saying but Morgan clearly will not
harm her child.

You're from Water's End too, right?
That's where you got the an-im-al...

MORGAN
I saved him from a sinking cargo ship.
What do you mean, "too?"

Enola glances at Helen for a moment. She hesitates.

ENOLA
Helen found me when I was a baby ina
boat full of earth-greens and sand.
Also, the glass amulets. That's why
they're lucky...

Morgan takes this in for a moment, then:

MORGAN
Why are you telling me?

ENOLA

You can help us get back there.
MORGAN

Itm not looking for Water's End.
ENOLA

What dtyou mean? Everyone's looking

for it.
MORGAN

Not me.
ENOLA

Don't you dream about it?

Morgan shakes his head, expressionless.

ENOLA

Close your eyes...
MORGAN

Why?
ENOLA

dust close them... please. It‘s a

. game.
Morgan closes his eyes.

ENOLA

Now, picture Water's End. What's the
first thing you do when you get there?

Morgan frowns. Hesitates. He opens his eyes.

MORGAN
Let the animal run.

ENOLA
(delighted)
See. You do have a dream when you
close your eyes! D'you like Helen...

MORGAN
I don't like anybody. Too risky.

ENOLA
You don't like me?

Morgan looks at her. How can you not like this kid?

ENOLA
You're going to help us, right?

But Morgan pulls himself back.

MORGAN
Listen, Enola. A dream is just a dream.
If you really came from Water's End,
then why did they set you drifting?

ENOLA
To bring back all the Searchers...

Enola lifts her sleeve and points to the tattoo on her left
shoulder.
ENOLA
See this? That's the secret map.
That's what we have to figure out.

At that moment, Helen walks up to them and pulls Enola off the
horse.

HELEN
I told you never to tell that to
atrangers!! Never!! Are you crazy??

CUT TO:
THE BOW. NIGHT.

A cloudless sky, the stars shine brilliantly. Morgan is alone,
charting his position against the constellations. His lifts up
his sextant. Now, Helen approaches from inside...

MORGAN
What are you doing up?

HELEN
I'm feeling better. I thought maybe
you wanted company.

Morgan looks at her. Company?

HELEN
I never had a chance to thank you for
saving her.

MORGAN
Don't bother. It was crazy. I
wouldn't do it again.

They look at one another.

HELEN
(hopeful)
What are you thinking about?

MORGAN
We were so close to them, I could
taste it. Now it's back to zero.

He turns back to his sextant. Helen studies him for a moment.
That's all he thinks about -- pirates? She shakes her head,
looks down. Tries another tack.

HELEN
My grandfather used to tell the stories
about the Great Thaw. As the water rose,
the animals went higher and higher,
until there was no place left but the
stars. I used to know all their names.

Helen studies Morgan's horse for a moment.

HELEN
You're animal... God, it's been so
jong. Tau... Taurus. No wait.
Pegasus. That's it. He's a Pegasus.
MORGAN
Enola likes him.
HELEN

Yes. She likes you too.

A beat. They stare at each other. It hangs there for a moment,
then Morgan looks down at his charts. Helen sighs.

Morgan frowns.

HELEN
I want to go with you.
MORGAN
What?
HELEN

Find those pirates.

HELEN
They took prisoners when they attacked
us, Women and young boys. My
sister's there.

MORGAN
That has nothing to do with me.

HELEN
Revenge. That's all you care about?

MORGAN
And what if it is?

HELEN
That make you just like them.
CoT TO:

A PERISCOPE POV. MORNING.

Cross-hairs and scale markings. - PANNING across the ocean.
Flat, blue horizon for 75°. Then a barge. A green flag is
flapping from its mast. It’s the “Miranda.”

VOICE (0.S.}
Fu-ne! Fu-ne!! Sho-gyotrlt
THE “MIRANDA."

Helen and Enola are busy unraveling a trawling net, Morgan
feeding the horse when...

...there is a CRASHING SOUND of waves.

A mass of water rises up beside the barge, revealing a smali,
antiquated submarine. Morgan races inside the bridge and
emerges instantly with his speargun and a pistol. He SHOUTS at
the women.
MORGAN
Get out of sight! Quick.

Morgan takes cover behind a barrel.

The submarine hatch SQUEAKS open. TWO JAPANESE GUYS emerge. One
is a fat sumo-wrestler type with a shaved head, the other is an
old man with an endless white beard. The fat guy has tattoos
all over his body -- Yakuza-style. He is GIGGLING nervously,
his finger twitching on the trigger of a cross-bow. The old man
unfurls a small green flag and waves it. Morgan eyes them
suspiciously, his guns drawn. :

MORGAN
{calling out)
You speak English?

VOICE (0.S.)
I do.

A completely bald BLACK WOMAN emerges from the hatch. She is
WANDA, tough but somehow endearing. .

MORGAN
(suspicious)
What do you want?

WANDA
We need spark plugs. Got any? -

MORGAN
Maybe. What are you trading?

ANOTHER JAPANESE with round gold spectacles emerges carrying a
bundle. He holds it up.

WANDA
Gill net. Two hundred yards long. No
holes.

MORGAN

I got all the nets I need.

Wanda translates for the Japanese. The old man seems to be the
boss. Wanda is just the interpreter. They came to a decision.

WANDA
How ‘bout hydro? Five G's for six
plugs.
CONTINUED:

(CONT. )

MORGAN
Ten.

Translation. Another debate. Fatty points to the horse and
says something to Wanda.

WANDA
The animal. Would you trade it?

MORGAN
No. No way.

Enola turns to Helen, as the Japanese debate some more.

ENOLA
why would they want the an-im-al on
their submarine?

HELEN
They want to eat it...

Enola reacts in disgust. Wanda turns back with their decision.

WANDA
Q.K. You're on. Ten G's.

Spectacles goes below and gets two jugs of water.

MORGAN
Tell him to drink some.

Spectacles puts the jug to his lips and takes a swig. He smiles.

MORGAN
The other one too.

He tries the second. Morgan waits for him to swallow but he
can't fake it anymore. He spits the salt water back into the
ocean. The Japanese grin sheepishly.

MORGAN
Real cute.

WANDA
Hey give us a break. It's tough
getting hydro in a sub.

MORGAN

O.K. Five gallons. But there's one
more thing.

Morgan stands and points to Helen and Enola.

MORGAN
Take these two to a flotilla.

Helen stands up, enraged.

They're harmless. Look at them.
Meanwhile, Wanda transiates and Fatty smiles broadly. He looks
at Helen lecherously.

ENOLA
I don't like them. I don't want to
go.

MORGAN

You're much safer on a sub. No
pirates, no hurricanes. It's the
quickest way you're going to get to
another flotilla...

Morgan grabs six spark plugs froma locker. Helen looks
shattered. .

MORGAN
I can't take responsibility for you
anymore. Drifters just don't take
passengers.

HELEN
I guess I was right about you.

MORGAN
(menace)
Yeah, maybe you were. You know how
many people I've had to kill just to
stay alive?

She's about to speak but doesn't. He softens.

MORGAN
We're looking for different things.

Helen hesitates.

Then she plays her trump card.

HELEN
Listen. You know what Enola said
about her tattoo? It's true. We're
going to get to Water's End. I'll cut
you in.

MORGAN
I don't believe in Water's End.

The Japanese throw down a boarding plank. Spectacles carries
the water across and snatches the plugs from Morgan's hands.

Fatty grabs Helen by the arm.

HELEN
Get your hands offa me, jumbo!!
Helen glares at Morgan.
MORGAN
I've always been solo.
The Japanese escort the women across the plank.

MORGAN
Helen...

She turns. Morgan tosses her his survival knife in its sheath.

MORGAN
Do what you gotta do...
The Japanese move to intercept the knife but Helen pulls it out
of the air...
On the fly, she has yanked the gleaming blade out of its sheath

and flashed it up in warning. The Japanese are impressed.
Obviously, Helen knows her way around a knife.

She turns back to Morgan and scowls at him.

He averts his eyes and moves towards his horse. The Japanese
push the women below and pull back the plank.

WANDA
See you on the waves, drifter.

They close the hatch and dive.
Morgan turns back and watches the bubbles ripple to the surface
as the sub sinks and sinks...

cuT TO:
INSIDE THE SUB. NIGHT.
The galley is a cramped, claustrophobic affair with steam
HISSING from leaky valves. Water DRIPS down in several
locations causing swamps of moss and corrosion.

Enola and Helen are sleeping in a pair of hammocks which CREAK
back and forth with the currents.

A large dark form sneaks up on them. It’s Fatty, holding a
rope. He reaches down for Helen's wrist...

.-but she springs bolt uprighti!! Knife drawn. Enola blinks
her eyes sleepily.
HELEN
I'm warning you, hippo!! You touch
me, you’re sashimi.

Fatty withdraws GRUNTING obscenities under his breath.

THE “MIRANDA”. DAY.

Morgan has returned his barge to a semblance of order. He is
busy at the stern hauling in the kelp-trawling nets. Pulling
the dripping strands of kelp into a big pile.

Then, he notices something shiny caught in the rope netting. He
reaches for it...

Enola's amulet!!!

Morgan holds it up in the sun. He stares at the glass lens in
disbelief. Gazes out towards the empty horizon. Looks back at
the lens. Pensive...

As if on cue, the horse trots up to him. They stare at each
other like lonely bachelors.

MORGAN
Don't look at me like that. I already
had my family.
CUT TO:

THE SUB ENGINE ROOM. DAY.

The submarine's antiquated engine churns round and round like a
broken blender. wanda is replacing the spark plugs, oiling the
valves. Helen's watching her while Enola wanders about
aimlessly.
WANDA

Daihiro tried to get in your pants?

That two-timing $.0.B... He's gettin’

sick of me, I can feel it. I like

tying him up, you know... kinky stuff.

Helen makes a face. Enola walks up, petulant and grumpy.

ENOLA
I miss him.

HELEN
Who?

ENOLA
The drifter.

HELEN

Kow can you miss a pirate??
Enola looks at her, frowning.

thirty gallons of gas for you.

HELEN
Did they say anything special about my
girl?

WANDA
No. Why?

HELEN

Just wondering...
CuT TO:
THE SURFACE.

The sub emerges near a nondescript platform in the center of a
maze of boats. The hatch SQUEAKS open. Fatty pops his head
out...

Immediately, several MEN race over with machine guns. A ONE-
LEGGED MAN climbs down from a crow's nest with a dueling
pistol. TWO MEN swing onto a nearby platform on ropes with
daggers in their mouths. Everyone has a triangular mark on
their forehead...
ONE - LEG
Hi ho, mates. Dropped in for tea, did
we?
CUT TO:

LATER.

The prisoners are escorted by a platoon of pirates towards the
main platform. Helen looks around grimly. Enola notices a
familiar face among the escort -- it's Troy!!

But he looks like a pirate now -- warpaint, dreadlocks... he's
carrying a spear.

ENOLA
Troy!! It's me!?!
TROY

Sshhh!!! I can't talk to you...

ANGEL
Son of a bitch. Look who's here...

cur To:
THE THRONE PLATFORM.

The procession arrives under the great water tower. The trio of
Japanese bow deferentially. Wanda, Helen and Enola stand
alongside. There is a wave of MURMURING among the pirates, as
fingers point towards Enola's tattoo. Carlos moves up to the
throne to brief Lazlo.

CARLOS
The ‘Japs say they know nothing. They
stole ‘em from a drifter. The woman
- and kid ain't talking.

LAZLO
(pointing to Fatty)
Keep blubber-beliy alive. Kill his
mates in a way no one will forget.

Carlos walks up to the Japanese trio. Nonchalantly, he slips
his hands into a pair of rubber gloves. The Japanese eye him
cautiously -- what's he doing? A couple of pirates wheel over a
glass fish tank. There appear to be eels inside. Carlos
reaches in and grabs one in each hand. He swings them around by
their tails, building speed...

Suddenly, he flings them forward. They swish through the air
and coil like bolas around the necks of Spectacles and the oid

Immediately, their heads light-up like fireworks... they're
electric eels!! The Japanese grab desperately, trying to wrench
the eels from their necks. Fatty watches his mates in horror.
Electric bolts are shooting out of their ears. Their eyes light
up like torches... then, they collapse to the ground.

Fatty stares in stunned silence. Lazio studies his reaction.
Then, turns his attention to the women.

Helen stares up at him defiantly. Without a word, he ambles
over to her. Real ciose. Enola gazes up at his towering frame.
Lazlo glances at Enola, then back to Helen.

Eye to eye. He smiles.

HELEN
If you so much as touch her, I'll rip
your balls clear out of the sack.

Lazlo looks at her for as moment. Chuckles. Laughs a little.
Then, guffaws in a great ROAR.

EXTREME CLOSE UP - A WATER DROP.
Pear shaped, swelling. It reaches the critical mass and falls,
disintegrating on impact. Landing on human skin. Somebody's
nose.

WE FOLLOW as the drop rivulets down the bridge and falls again
off the nose tip.

WIDEN:

The nose belongs to Helen. Her head is strapped in the harness
of some kind of torture chair. A water reservoir suspended
above dribbles out single drops of drinking water. Tantalizing,
down her nose, passing millimeters from her lips...

It's high coon and she could sure use a drink. But any movement
of her jaw pulls the hinged door of another reservoir, releasing
a stream of salt on to her face.

Great mirrcezs have been set up around her to focus additional
sunlight om her. The heat is intense...

Drip, drip, drip...

Helen can’t stand it any longer. She opens her mouth for a
drink but em avalanche of salt pours out. She gags...

The salt pours on. She spits through it.

LAZLO'S YACHT.

It is a huge boat with jarringly eclectic decor. Though
generally nautical in theme, there is everything from arabesque
ottomans to Chinese screens, all arranged in the epitome of
ostentation.

Enola is seated in a plush chair. Nervous. Helmer stands
behind her.

The sound Of BREAKING GLASS.

VOICE (0.8.)

ANGLE ON:

THE "DOC", an obese quack with jaundiced skin and rotting teeth.
He is fumbling over a cart of surgical instruments.

boc
Where the fuck is that piece of shit
needle?

He's shaking like a addict in rehab. He plunges his plump hand
into a pile of medical hardware, spilling several probes on to
the floor and finds a huge trocar syringe, old and rusted.

boc
Hold the fucking fish.
{smiles weakly)
Please, sir.

Lazio moves in and steadies a flapping pirukuru fish with his
enormous hands. The Doc guides the formidable syringe towards
the puffer, but his hands are shaking epileptically...

LAZLO
It's in the liver.

boc
I know, I know. . I fucking know.

Abruptiy, he plunges the needle into the fish and withdraws a
full vile of slimy, greenish fluid. Enola watches in horror as
the fish ceases to struggle. Now it's her turn...

hurls it straight up in the air...

to get its bearings. Then, begins to fly due west.

dawns on him. He leaps up...

Morgan picks up his spyglass, scans the horizon. Nothing...

But now there's a distant sound -- APPROACHING ENGINES. Morgan -
points his scope eastwards, towards the sound. -

SPYGLASS POV.

The early morning sun makes the ocean shimmer. Mirage-like,
barely visible through the undulating ripples, a fleet of
vessels advance...

ON MORGAN.
He is momentarily stunned -- it's finally happening!!

Abruptly, Morgan begins to rush around the barge, preparing for
the imminent attack. He ieads his horse to the ster edge,
pushes him off...

MORGAN
Goon. Get out of here!

The horse stares at him blankly, treading water. Impulsively,
Morgan takes the amiet from his neck, leans down and puts it
around that of the horse.

MORGAN
You'll need all the luck you can get.

He SMACKS its rear and the horse begins to swim away. Morgan
vaces to the barrels -- sets the booby-trap. He rushes to a
locker. Pulls out the oxygen container. Grabs his spear gun.
Loads two bolts and pumps it up. an belt of extra ammo. He
tosses all this gear into a small tight-weave net...

tosses this into a second net. Now he ties both nets into
bundles, attaches them to separate painter lines...

The sound of automatic GUNFIRE. Riccos rip into the wooden

Morgan ducks and quickly tosses both net bundles overboard.

Bullets spray over his head. Morgan keeps cool. He reaches for
arag, a stick. Ties them together and...

WE TILT DOWN into the murky water below the platform. A dark
FIGURE pops his head up -- it’s Morgan...

HIS POV.

Several dozen boats surround the platform. A veritable maze of ©
canals between them. Pirates jump from boat to boat converging ©
towards the “main attraction" -- roasting animal flesh.

Morgan glances at Lazlo for a moment. Then, looks the other way
and spots Helmut making his way up the ramp of Lazlo's
impressive yacht. About fifty yards dead across the “canal.".

ON MORGAN
should be easy enough. He takes a deep breath and dives...
UNDERWATER.

Ten yards, twenty. Slow but steady progress. A stern boarding
ladder, dead ahead. Smooth underwater breast stroke. But now,
from behind...

A GUARD SHARK!!! Converging like a torpedo...

Morgan doubles his effort. Ten more yards to the ladder. will
he make it? The shark closes in. Morgan strokes as fast as he
can. The shark opens its jaws. Morgan reaches desperately.
The shark lunges for his legs but...

TWANG II

Stops inches short. It's on a leash. The stunned shark backs
off in frustration. Tries to lunge again. But the leash stops
it just shy of Morgan on the ladder. Morgan catches his breath.
Climbs up.

LAZLO'S YACHT.

It's a rope ladder on the stern. Morgan looks up. Thirty feet
to the main deck. Will he be noticed? He starts up, rung by
vung...

He looks to his left. All the pirates are focused on the
impending feast. A few more rungs. He looks up...

A YOUNG PIRATE staring right down at him!! It's Troy, patroling
the deck... Morgan looks at him. Will he sound the alarm? Troy
hesitates...
VOICE (0.8.)
Get over here boy! I ain't done with
you yet...

Troy backs off. Morgan breathes a sigh of relief. He climbs up
to the rail. and peers over. Troy is following Carlos, who's
carrying a pair of swords...

Morgan waits until they're out of sight and quietly hauls
himself onto the deck...
CUT TO:

MEANWHILE. ON THE STERN OF THE “STOCKADE" BOAT.

The "Doc" climbs on board with a lecherous smile. He addresses
a seared GUARD.
boc
Who's available?

GUARD
All of ‘em. Everybody just wants to
eat animal tonight.

boc
(his eyes light up)
I'll take the feisty one.

The “Doc hands him something round and shiny -- a pearl. The
guard bites into it. Satisfied of its authenticity, he drops it
in a small cash box with a haif-dozen other pearls. He unlocks
the stockade.

GUARD
Help yerself.
INSIDE.
The "Doc" exters with a big grin. Helen smiles back at him.

HELEN
I hope it's me you want.

The "Doc" can hardly believe his ears. He approaches her...

But Wanda leaps out and loops her manacles around his neck,
breaking it with a sickening CRACK.

WANDA
Wow... That kinda turned me on...

Angel grabs the keys. Quickly, they unlock their chains.
OUTSIDE.

The guard is staring idly at the roasting horse and surrounding
activity. Behind him, the door CREAKS open.

GUARD
(without turning)
Talk about a quickie...

Helen sneaks out, reaching for his knife. It's sheathed on his
hip. Helen's fingertips:stretch towards the knife handle...

Suddenly, he turns!! Helen yanks out the knife and plants it
into his ribs. His eyes lock open in frozen shock.

HELEN
{grabbing his gun)
I hate quickies.
CUT BACK TO:
LAZLO’S YACHT.

TWO SENTRIES are patrolling the main deck. One of them spots
something ahead.
SENTRY
Well lookee here.

It's a feather attached to a scrap of cloth. He reaches down
for it but it moves suddenly... eluding his grasp. He lunges
but again it skitters away from him. Round the corner...

The sentry frowns. Is it just the night breeze? He stomps
after it.

AROUND THE CORNER.

It's Morgan playing the old monofilament trick. He reels in the
feather. The sentry comes after it. And, in a flash, the nylon
becomes a garotte around his neck...

WITH THE OTHER SENTRY.

Waiting for his friend's return. A VOICE comes from around the
corner.
VOICE (0.S.)
(whisper)
Hey. Come see this.

He frowns. Something fishy here. He unsheaths his dagger.
Edges up to the corner... pauses, back to the wall, peeking...

HIS POV.

A glimpse of a body lying ‘motionless on the deck -- someone got
his buddy!! His instincts were right, it's a trap.
CONTINUED:
58.
{CONT. }

The ambusher mst be waiting just like he is -- back to the
wall, right on the other side of the corner. The sentry readies
his knife... then suddenly...

Lunges round the corner!! The knife connects with flesh. The
ambusher collapses into his arms. But it's not Morgan!! It's

the first sentry propped into a standing position...

Morgan is the guy on the ground, “playing dead." He grabs the
second sentry by the ankle. Twists him down to the deck. His
head SLAMS down against the ground. Out cold.

CUT TO:
LAZLO'S QUARTERS

Helmut walks across the ostentatious owner's cabin towards a
safe on the far wall, amulets dangling from his neck. He starts
to dial in the combination. .

VOICE
Stop!

Helmut turns to find Morgan aiming his spear gun at him.

RELMUT
You again!

MORGAN
Yeah. You can't run away from me.
That scar on your left arm. You've
had it all your life, right? How
could I know that? Because you were a
baby when it happened.

Helmut looks at the scar -- was that just a lucky guess?

MORGAN
He attacked us. Killed your mother.
I thought you were dead. But he must
have taken you. You have to remember
that! I know you do...

Helmut suddeniy drops to his knees, covering his face in his
RELMUT
Oh God...

Morgan approaches him softly, hand outstretched...

But, suddenly, Helmut lashes out, swatting the speargun from his
hand!! He SLUGS him in the jaw with a right... left, thena
great HEAD-BUTT in the forehead that sends Morgan reeling silly
to the floor.
HELMUT

Should've died the first time,

drifter. Now I'm gonna make it really

hurt...

Helmut kicks him in the gut. .Morgan GROANS.

(CONT. )

RELMUT
Sorry, pops. Just my rebellious
phase.

Another KICK sends Morgan's jaw snapping sideways like a mouse-
trap. Blood gushes down from his nose... his fingers stretch
out for the spear gun... Helmut STOMPS down on his hand....

But now Morgan wrenches his ankle out from under him -- same
move as with the sentry. Helmut crashes down to the ground.
Morgan grabs his gun and BONKS him on the head, knocking him
out...

CUT TO:

SOMEWHERE. IN THE FLOTILLA.

Morgan is dragging Helmit's unconscious body through the shadowy
platforms. Morgan has disguised himself with pirate warpaint
and headgear. There are VOICES. Morgan freezes...

A COUPLE OF PIRATES round the bend, sucking on horse ribs. ‘They
spot Morgan... and the body!

isT PIRATE
Hey. What's this?

MORGAN
(silly grin}
Too mich kelp cider... I'm putting him

to bed.
2ND PIRATE
Helmut doesn't drink.
MORGAN

Yeah. That's what happens when you're
not used to it...

1ST PIRATE
Well, who the hell are you?? I ain't
seen you before...

MORGAN
Ho, ho, that's funny... you guys musta
been drinking too, huh?

The pair eye him suspiciously. Morgan tries to keep grinning...
then:
MORGAN
Puck this...

He BLASTS two rounds with his spear gun. Bulls-eyes in both

hearts...
CUT TO:

THE "TRAINING" PLATFORM.

WE ARE in a remote corner of the flotilla. A twenty-foor
dueling ring surrounded by a margin of broken glass shards.

CONTINUED:

(CONT. )

Carlos and Troy are sparring with two-handed swords. Troy can
barely lift his weapon. While Carios slashes effortlessly
through the air using his good hand. CLANG!!!

Troy retreats. He barely blocked that last one. Again, the

sword comes Slashing around. CLANG!!! Troy's feet are inches
from the deadly glass perimeter...
CARLOS

Come oni! Are you going to die like
your friends???

CLANG!!! Troy's arms are weakening...
CARLOS
Keep your sword up, you little wimp!!!
CLANG!!! That one sends Troy limping backwards. He SCREAMS as
the glass cuts up his feet... Carlos lowers his sword.
CARLOS

You had enough??
Troy nods, lowers his sword. WOOOSH... Here comes the blade!!!

Troy ducks in the nick of time. The sword SWISHES a hair's
width above his head.

CARLOS
Never let down your guard!!! You
hopeless moron. I oughta kill you

right now.

Troy begins to tremble slightly. He's breaking. Carlos laughs
sadistically.
CARLOS
You belong with the women.

...but then a huge sword comes bursting through his abdomen!!!
Carlos goes bug-eyed, gurgles blood, collapses.

ANGEL
Fucking sexist!!

She looks down at his frozen body. Troy breaks into a big grin.
Angel smiles back, grabs his hand.

ANGEL
Let's get out of here.
TROY
(toa CARLOS)

Never let down your guard, asshole.

THE FUELING DOCK.
Wanda, Helen and Enola, armed with clubs and other weapons, are
sneaking along the shadowy platform along which the attack

cigarette boats are moored.

They pause behind several dozen oil drums of fuel. There is the
distant sound of the ongoing CELEBRATION. Helen looks around.
The coast seems clear.
HELEN
(pointing to a boat)
Let's take the yellow one.
(to WANDA)
You take care of the goodbye present.

Helen crawls round the barrel and comes face to face with...
...a SENTRY!!

She SLAMS him with the club but he ducks, pinning her against
the barrels which avalanche down. He raises his speargun and
stops... recognizing her! It's Morgan.

MORGAN
Surprised to see me, huh?
KELEN
I thought you were dead...
MORGAN

Other people make that mistake too.

Enola peeks around and sees Morgan. She runs up and gives him a
hug. But Morgan pushes her off. Enola looks hurt...

MORGAN
I knew I should've killed you right
off. You show people some mercy and
they go and stab you in the back.

ANGLE ON HELMUT
Is his little finger twitching slightly?

HELEN (0.S.)
What are you talking about?
CLOSE - WANDA
She pokes her head out from hiding.
WANDA

You two at it again? You ever
consider marriage counseling?

HELEN (0.S.)
Just rig those booby traps, will you?

Wanda smirks and pulls out a fishing net. She starts to cut it
up in small squares with the knife...

MORGAN (0.S.)
Oho! A quick getaway now? Real
smooth plan. Almost too smart for
your own good.

As Morgan and Helen continue arguing, WE FOLLOW Enola who has
spotted the glass amulets on Helmut's neck. Her eyes light up.

ENOLA
(to herself)
Both of them! They really are lucky...

She kneels down beside Helmut, reaches out to pull them off.
Leaning dangerously close...

HELEN (0.S.)
You think I'm up to something? Say it.

MORGAN (0.S.)
Don't play innocent with me. You set
me up with the pirates. Made some
sweet little deal. And now this is the
big double-cross. Just remember one
thing, lady. Pirates don't think too
much when they're mad. They just kili.

One of the the amilet chains is stuck. mola struggles to lift
Helmut ‘s torso -- did he just blink slightly?

HELEN (0.S.)
I set you up?? Hah!! Don't flatter
yourself, drifter. I'd have been lucky
to get a half a jug of hydro for you.

...suddenly Helmut's hand springs up round Enola's neck!! He's
come alive. Enola SCREAMS... Helmut is strangling her with the
amulets...

Morgan turms. Helen pulls out the gun. Aims it at Helmt's
head, She FIRES but Morgan dives at her arm...

...sending the gun, flying into the water!! Helen glares at him.

MORGAN
That's my sont!
Helen looks at him in utter bewilderment.
cuT TO:

THE TOWER PLATFORM.
Lazlo spins suddenly towards the sound of gunfire. He turns to
a LARGE GOON.

LAZLO
What was that?

The GOON shrugs.
LAZLO
Where's Helmut?

Tne GOON shrugs again.

THE “FUELING” PLATFORM.

Now Helmut is standing up, holding mola “hostage” in a choke
hold.

HELMUT
Everybody freeze... hands up, real
slow.
They comply.
RELMUT
You, too...

He points. to Wanda who's been busy loading extra fuel drums on
the yellow boat. Wanda stands up and. looks at him.

HELMUT
Now... we're all going back to join
the celebration. Single file...

Wanda hesitates...

HELMUT

Move it! Or I'll kill her!
HELEN

Piease, Wanda...
WANDA

Hey, it's every drifter for
themselves. I don't even like the
kid.

HELMUT
Good... ‘Cause I'm going to break her
little neck.

Enola SCREAMS. Helmut starts to twist the the glass medallions,
tightening the chains around Enola's neck...

HELEN
Nol!t! NOI!

Enola's face is turning blue when...

BONK!!!

Helmut falls down, unconscious. It's Troy and Angel. (Bet you
were wondering when they'd show up.)

ANGEL
I'm ready to leave now.

Helen rushes towards Enola. She picks her up and carries her
into the yellow boat. Wanda is already at the controls. She
FIRES it up. Angel and Troy jump in...

Morgan hesitates on the dock, looking down at Helmut...

He is...
ENOLA
No. He saved my life!!
{to MORGAN)

Come on, quick...

Now haif-a-dozen ARMED PIRATES spill onto a nearby platform,
across the “canal." They spot them...

PIRATE
Hey!! Hold it...

Helen pulls Enola's hand off the throttle.

HELEN
(to WANDA)
Get moving!!

The boat begins to pull away. Morgan stares at it, frozen... He
looks back at Helmut...

GUNFIRE erupts around him...
The pirates are closing in...

PIRATE
KILL THEM. SHOOT!!!

Mergan looks at him. Looks at Helmt...
Thinking...

Suddenly, Morgan turns towards the yellow boat. He runs to the
edge of the platform and dives... but his hand misses the rail!!

..-Enola throws him the stern line. He grabs the rope...

...Wanda kicks it into full power, and the boat surges out
towards the open sea, dragging Morgan along behind...

...the pirates converge on the platform and jump into pursuit
vessels. Engines ROAR to life...

...a pirate throws his into gear and there is a CALAMITOUS
GROAN!! He looks back towards the outboard...

But no one can hear him over the sound of ENGINES. The other
boats start up and foul their propellers...

IN THE OCEAN.

The yellow boat speeds out into the black night, leaving the
Pirate flotilla far back in its wake...

Morgan has hauled himself aboard. He looks exhausted... empty.

Helen turns to him...

HELEN
I thought your son was dead.

MORGAN
He is...

AERIAL ANGLE.

The wake of the moon seems to race along with the tiny boat as
they head out into the vast ocean...

ANGEL'S VOICE
Cut the engines when we're out of eye-
sight. If they can't hear us, they'll
never find us at night.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE NEXT DAY. ~

Everyone's asleep except Angel. And she's yawning. It's just
daybreak. The yellow boat is drifting alone.

Angel moves up to Helen. Gives her a nudge... She leaps up,
ready to fight.
ANGEL
Whoah, kiddo. It's dawn, that's all.

HELEN

(groggy)
You see anything.

ANGEL
Nah. Three-sixty of flat and clear.

HELEN

What about him?

ANGEL
An intense guy. Nightmares all night.
You sure know how to pick 'em, sis.

MINUTES LATER.
The yellow boat rips south across the open sea. Morgan moves up

to Helen.
MORGAN
This is nuts. You don't run from
pirates you can't see. That's burning
petroi for nothing. Just drift and
take your chances.
HELEN
Yeah. You're the expert on pirates,
huh?
MORGAN
No... you are.
HELEN
Listen, drifter. For what it's worth,
I think you're an asshole but I didn't
set you up.
Morgan is silent. Helen grabs a hold of Troy.
HELEN
Hey, kid. You should know how pirates
think. You almost became one. What
dtyou think we oughta do?
TROY .
Run like hell.
HELEN
(to MORGAN)
Sorry, pal. You're outvoted.
DISSOLVE TO:
NIGHT.
Helen is tucking Enola into a berth in the forward cabin.

HELEN
You have the last watch, I'll wake
you up when it's time. If we run out

ENOLA

Helen hesitates. ‘
ENOLA
Please...
HELEN

O.K., dolphin. If you promise to
close your eyes.

(takes a breath)
One day, deep in the deep blue, a
little fish came across a sunken
chest. It was beautiful and shiny so
he knew there was something precious
inside. He tried to open it but the
latches were stuck. No matter how
hard he pulled, they just wouldn'r
budge.

OUTSIDE.

Morgan is lying rolled up in a blanket against the starboard
rail. He's also listening to Helen's story which drifts out
through the porthole window.

HELEN (0.S.)
Then, he noticed a killer whale
swimming by. And the little fish
said: “you're the strongest in the
sea, will you help me open my chest?"
The whale said, "Sure." But instead
of opening it, he swallowed the chest
up whole. “Now the chest belongs to
me," he laughed...

Morgan leans near the window, takes a peak inside.

HIS POV.

Helen's eyes are sparkling in the light of the gas lantern.
There's something hypnotic about her whispering voice, something

mesmerizing.
HELEN

The little fish was very mad. He
found a school of hammerhead sharks
and told them that the whale had a
valuable chest in his stomach. The
greedy sharks lunged at the whale and
ripped a hole in his belly...

INSIDE.

Enola's eyes pop open in horror. Helen smiles and slowly closes
Enola's eyelids with her fingers.

CONTINUED:
68.
(CONT. }

HELEN
You promised, Enola...

In the background, WE SEE Morgan staring in at mother and child,
a look of longing in his eyes. Helen continues, her tone calm
and reassuring.
HELEN

The chest fell out, but by now, ali the

fish in the sea had heard about the

chest and there was a huge fight over

it. In the struggle, it opened up and

they all gathered round to look inside.

But there was nothing except a small,

dead goldfish, Everyone turned to the

little fish. "There's nothing in

there," they shouted, "this chest is

worthless. At that moment, an old wise

dolphin swam up to the group. He said:

“There was sweet water in that chest;

worthless to you, but worth life to that

goldfish. Now, there is nothing..."

Helen looks at Enola. Fast asleep, floating away into her
dreams.

DISSOLVE To:
HOURS LATER.
The first light of dawn is breaking and Enola is at the helm.
The others are asleep below. The engine SPUTTERS a few times
and dies. No more gas.

It is completely stiil, save the sound of LAPPING WATER against
the hull. The vessel is on the cusp of a fog bank. As it
drifts, the cotton-like fog becomes thicker and thicker, until
it is milky white...

Now even the water becomes obscured by the thick creamy haze.
Enola looks around in awe. Everything beyond the boat has
disappeared into whiteness...

.+.Enola turns slowly round, sweeping the "non-panorama"...

+..0n the starboard side, the fog is as thick as anywhere but
something seems to be out there...

+..a presence...

---Enola notices something moving on the bow. A small white
bird -- it’s a dovetil

She can scarcely believe her eyes. She moves Closer to the bird
who retreats modestly. Morgan wakes up nearby. He blinks his
eyes, notices the bird. Enola sees him...

ENOLA
it's Water's End!! We're near...

Morgan stares at it...

MORGAN
Shit!! wake everybody up, quick.
It's the pirates.

..-suddenly, the bird FLAPS its wings and takes off...

Enola follows the bird with her eyes until it disappears in the
whiteness...
ENOLA
(excited)
No it's Water's End! I can feel it.

She strains to see through the haze...surely, there is something
out there. A huge presence, looming just behind the veil of
whiteness. It's becoming more visible, the boat seems to be
drifting towards it...

..-. something Solid and massive...
...Morgan stands up...

...suddenly, it bursts into visibility...
...AN ENORMOUS WALL OF STEEL...

...the cigarette boat is right alongside it. ‘They could reach
out and touch it, it's so close...

...Enola stares up, mouth agape, at the vast perimeter of steel,
soaring into the sky for hundreds of feet, extending
horizontally in both directions as far as thé eye can see. The
surface is coarse and weathered, paint peeling, pockets of rust
forming...
ENOLA
I‘tm home...
cuT To:

LONG SHOT.

Everyone is awake, staring up at the surreal perimeter like
sinners at the gates of heaven. Boat, steel curtain, and
whiteness is all that there is. They paddle along the barrier,
searching for its limits...

...now it seems to be changing angle, the wall is beginning to
slope in an overhang. At the water level, it begins to recede;
overhead, it projects outwards. Finally, the wall ends ina
sloping diagonal...

They paddle the cigarette boat across the edge of the wall.
It's almost thick as it is tall. on the other side, it sweeps
back in an identical mirror image...

TROY

Look!i!

He's pointing to some writing high up on the wall. ‘The faded
letters read:

“U.S.S. BRIDGESTON"
It's a ship!!!
cur TO:
LATER.

The group is making its way up an endless diagonal ramp that is
suspended along the hull. The cigarette boat seems like a toy,
hundreds of feet below at the base of the ramp.

Their sea legs are wobbly, unaccustomed to such solid ground.
For the first time, it's not rolling below them.

Morgan leads with his speargun drawn. The others follow with a
mixture of caution and bewilderment.

THE DECK.

The group emerges onto the vast plane of the deck. It is just
above the fog layer so the huge plateau seems to be floating on
an endiess sea of whiteness.

The area is larger than a dozen football fields strung out end
to end. Towards the stern, a massive bridge soars up several
stories. The surface is dotted with plant and animal life.
Several gnarly olive trees are growing somehow, bursting through
the deck from pockets where enough earth has gathered to sustain
them. A small bird colony has formed, with pelicans dive
bombing the water for food to bring back to their young.

Morgan looks around. “There's not a human in sight...

MORGAN
This place is too quiet. Stay here,
I'ii check her out.

WANDA
I'm going with.

Morgan and Wanda make their way along the darkened corridors in
the bowels of the old boat. Wanda has the lantern from the
cigarette boat...

The corridor is getting darker, moldy...

What's taking so long??

Helen glances suddenly in our direction and WE DUCK BACK...

CUT BACK TO:

Wanda enters a large darkened chamber. There is a LOW AMBIENT
MURMUR OF SQUEAKING. Wanda adjusts her lantern, to raise the
flame. The room begins to glow and she notices...

He reaches out to another door. It opens with a CREAK... seems
to be the Captain's cabin. He steps...

INSIDE.

Dusty, cobwebs... mossy walls. A shaft of light from the
window. Morgan glances at the wide, double-berth. The covers
are lumpy -- could someone be sleeping in it?

Morgan advances, speargun raised... He reaches towards the
covers, yanks them back...

.. SKELETONS !!

Three people, maybe four. But what's strange is the bones --
they're all jet black...

CUT TO:
THE DECK.
Everyone's back, gathered for a meeting.
ENOLA
What's “Black Bone?"
HELEN
A plague just before you were born.
It wiped out whole flotillas. All
their bones became black...
Troy looks at her in horror...

Don't worry. It's not contagious
anymore, The virus dies with its
victims.

So this ship is ours.
ANGEL
Yeah. Let's see what we got.

Angel and T=oy have found an old pontoon plane near the bow.

Helen leads Enola to a large hatch on the backside of the bridge
tower. She swings it open and looks down.

HELEN
It's the engine room!! Come on.

INSIDE.

They make their way down the spiral staircase, descending into a
volume of Promethean proportions. A dizzying array of catwalks
suspended above two mammoth turbines. Twin steam driven screws
with racks upon racks of support equipment. A stupendous
network of pipes and tubing.

They come to the upper level in front of two giant reservoirs.
Helen twists open the huge bleeder valve. Some liquid trickles
out. She wets her finger, tastes it.

HELEN
Distilled water! It's steam powered.

ENOLA
This one's filled with petrol!

They look at each other like jackpot winners.
CUT TO:
THE CREW QUARTERS.

Morgan and Wanda have found a small gymnasium, complete with
Nautilus machines, barbells, “Stairmasters", rowers and
exercise bikes. The machinery looks spooky in the subdued
light. Morgan enters, gun drawn.

WANDA
What is it?

MORGAN
Torture chamber, maybe...

WANDA
We could have a loads of fun in here,
for example. Or are you just not into
that?

Suddenly, a HAND clamps down over Wanda's mouth!!!

WANDA
Who are you? I thought everybody on
this tub died of blackbone?

MAN
Who am 1??? I'm Cornelius Funky,
inventor of the antidote for
blackbone. who are you -- is more the
point -- and what are you doing on my
ship?

MORGAN
It's a pretty big ship for just one
guy, Cornelius. You alone here?

CORNELIUS
No... of course, not. There are my
bodyguards. My harem, my...

WANDA

Yeah, right. So what's with this
antidote. It didn't work so good?

CORNELIUS

I only made enough for one dose...

THE MESS HALL.
Everyone is gathered around the “Captain's Table" for a
celebration feast. There's bottled “designer” water, bird's

eggs and olives. Cornelius is looking very uncomfortable with
the new campany. Enola, next to him, takes a swig of water...

ENOLA

It tickles...

Angel lets out a LOUD BELCH. Everyone LAUGHS. Helen comes out
of the pantry with a tray overflowing with cans.

CORNELIUS
Hey... that's my favorite paté.

HELEN
Relax, Cornelius. You have enough in

Helen begins prying open the cans and handing them out. Troy
tries to bite an olive, discovers the pit, hurts his teeth
trying to chew and finally spite it out.

CORNELIUS
Such table manners, young man! Are
you all just a bunch of savages? Look
at this girl... she has a tattoo!

ENOLA
(enjoying herself)
You like it?
. CORNELIUS
It looks like a lunar eclipse. We
happen to be having one tonight. What
synchronicity...

Morgan stands up suddenly.

MORGAN
Of course... an eclipse!!

TROY
What's an eclipse?

Morgan moves over towards Enola, his expression intense. He
takes the amulets from her. Hands him to Cormelius.

MORGAN
These are lenses, right?

CORNELIUS
So it would appear. An ocular and a
diopter...
(inspecting them)
very high quality, I might add.
Undoubtedly for a telescope...

MORGAN
That's itit

BELEN
What?

MORGAN

The secret!!

Do you have something round, a sphere
like the globe. A ball, anything...

CORNELIUS
I can do better than rhat.
CUT TO:

THE SHIP LIBRARY.

Everyone is gathered around Morgan for a demonstration. Long
shafts of late-afternoon light streak through the porthole
windows. Morgan is holding up a globe,the kind with the
mountain ranges raised up in bas-relief.

MORGAN
This is Waterworld. Before the Great
Thaw, Water's End was everywhere. Then,
the ocean rose and covered it all.

Everyone stares at what it used to be like. Morgan crosses to a
round white clock against the cabin wall. He points to it.

MORGAN
Pretend that's the moon.

Now, he holds the globe up in a shaft of light, casting a shadow
on the wall. He “moves” the shadow until it begins to "eclipse"
the clock face.
MORGAN
During an eclipse, we move directly
between the sun and the moon, casting
a@ shadow...

Now, only a “crescent" of sunlit clock remains. Identical in
proportion to Enola's tattoo.

MORGAN (Cont'd)
But we're also spinning at the same
time.

He begins to spin the globe on its axis, and suddenly, as if by
magic, a triangular nick grows out of the shadow portion,
cutting into the crescent!!!

It's one of the bas-relief mountains. He has spun the globe so
the tallest mountain is on the edge of the sphere -- the “lem"
of the earth -- casting a tiny triangular shadow against the
clock-face. It's exactly like the tattoo!

MORGAN
That's the nick in the tattoo. A
piece of Water’s End so tall that it
still sticks out from the ocean.

They look at him in stunned realization. An enlightened glow
sweeps across their faces. Enola is beaming.

ENOLA
I knew you would help us!

HELEN

How did you figure that out?

Morgan looks at Enola and smiles.

HELEN
Why didn't I think of that?

ANGEL
You wanted it too much.

Wanda looks completely confused. She's the only one that

doesn't get it.

Everyone nods.

MORGAN
Enola’s parents... or whoever gave her
the tattoo, sent her with a clue that
you could use from anywhere on the
Planet. It doesn't matter where you
are. You get the coordinates off the
moon with a sextant. If the moon is
overhead, then we would be here...

{points to the globe)

.-ninety degrees away from Water's
End. But if the moon is near the
horizon, then it would be right behind
us...

WANDA

Hold it... time out. Are you telling
me this kid drifted from Water's End?

WANDA
I like you better already, kid.

Morgan turns to Cornelius.:

MORGAN
What do you think of all this,
Cornelius?

CORNELIUS
Fascinating. Most impressive.
Particular your knowledge of
astronomy. How can a savage know all
this?

Cornelius points to an enormous stack of calenders.

CORNELIUS
The Funky family has been keeping
track of the days for six generations.

Helen grabs the “amulets."

HELEN
So wa need to rig these into a scope,
right? Can you do it?

CORNELIUS
Young lady, there is nothing of which
Cornelius Funky is incapable.

SUNSET.
Morgan is alone on the bridge terrace, deep in thought. Now,
there's the SOUND OF HOOFBEATS... Morgan looks down and can
scarcely believe his eyes...

There, below him on the deck, a white stallion, galloping
carefree on the vast open plane. Back and forth it runs,
shaking it's main, neighing up on its hind legs. Almost surreal
in the late-afternoon light...

Hi...
Morgan spins, crashing out of his daydream. It's Enola...

You think you'll recognize your real
parents when you see them again?

ENOLA
I don't know,

MORGAN
I wonder how long it takes to forget.

THE BRIDGE. NIGHT.

Cornelius has jerry-rigged a telescope out of a piece of metal
piping. He puts his eye to it and checks the focusing
mechanism. The others watch behind him.

CORNELIUS
Perfect.

He lets her take a look.

Helen smiles. Morgan smiles back. They're both smiling. This,

SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.

Cornelius moves towards a closet and swings the door cpen with a
flourish. It's packed with automatics and semis. A veritable
arsenal. Everyone is awake behind him, staring at the weapons.

CORNELIUS
I've been waiting so long to use
these.
ANGEL
There's no spare ammo. Just a couple
of clips.
WANDA
Great...
MORGAN
We'll have to improvise.
HELEN
How much longer until the eclipse?
CORNELIUS .
One hour and thirty six minutes.

We can stall them. We just need an

What about the airship? You know how
it works? .

CORNELIUS
Obviously.

MORGAN
O.K. Let's move... just keep them
from boarding.

ENOLA
Quick, come here!

Enola's at the viewing window, pointing down to the diagonal
boarding ramp, where several pirate vessels are converging.

MORGAN
Can you hoist that thing?

Cornelius goes to the control panel. Snaps on the "Masrer

Immediately, the entire deck is awash with orange mercury vapor
lights. Cornelius hits the “Ramp Winch" but nothing happens,
He flips it back and forth...

CORNELIUS

Oh oh...
MORGAN

Is there a manual override?
CORNELIUS

(a worried nod)
Down there...

SMASH CUT TO:
OUTSIDE.

Morgan vaults down the bridge ladder. Several pirate vessels
are closing in on the diagonal ramp that runs up the hull...

Morgan races across the deck. He yanks back the hoisting lever
but nothing happens. The ramp is stuck. Morgan looks down. A
safety hook is preventing the pulley from working. The pirate
boats are twenty yards and closing...

Morgan zooms down the ramp. ‘The pirates begin to FIRE. Sparks
fly in all directions as bullets ricochet off the steel huil.
Morgan lunges for the hook and tries to work it free. It's
rusty and stuck...

Now a pirate dives onto the ramp from his “whaler." He tries to
tackle Morgan but suddenly the hook comes loose.

Immediately, the gigantic winches turn and begin to suck the
ramp upwards...

The pirate looses his footing and Morgan kicks him in the jaw.
He plunges into the ocean. Morgan claws his way up the moving
ramp. Another vessel sweeps alongside and blasts a colum of

fire...

The ramp erupts into flame. Morgan scrambles through the fiery
tunnel and dives back onto the deck...

cur TO:
AERIAL ANGLE.
The tanker is completely surrounded by pirate vessels. Some

have searchlights which are raking over the vast hull, seeking
out points of vulnerability.

Their only advantage is the sheer height of the hull, maybe
forty yards from waterline to deck. It's like a floating
fortress but they are outnumbered forty to one.

He lowers a spyglass, turns to Helmut beside him at the bridge
of the pirate command ship. Their eyes lock.

LAZLO
You sure you've never seen him before?

HELMUT
I. swear it. He's just a drifter.
Lost his mind.

LAZLO
Good. Take him alive. I want to skin
him raw and dip him in salty brine. I

HELMUT

LAZLO
Don't call me that any more. I've

Helmit looks at him curiously.
ON THE DECK.

Wanda defends the starboard side. A rope with a gaff hook is
tossed up behind her, snagging the deck rail. She rushes to it,
flings it off. The PIRATE falls SCREAMING into the water.

THE PORT SIDE.

Helen is holding her own. Four hooks ropes come up at the same
time, but she slices them off with the survival knife.

Morgan is the "rover," rushing around from side to side as
needed.

THE BRIDGE TERRACE.

Enola is the “spotter." She has a large megaphone and YELLS
down points of attack as she sees them.

Cornelius, behind her, is wringing his hands nervously...
tweeking the telescope on occasion.

THE STERN.

The hull here is square and flat so this is where the pirates

are concentrating their efforts. Hooked ropes fly up in massive
volleys. Several pirate vessels are erecting a battlement with
masts and ladders. But Angel and Troy are holding it valiantly.

They lob down Molitov cocktails, which explode midair showering
the pirates with shrapnel. Then, they race over to the
battlement carrying a large cauldron-shaped vat. They lift it
up to the rail and pour its contents down...

It's boiling engine oil!!! The pirates writhe in agony under
the “napalm” waterfall, collapsing in SCREAMS into the ocean...
ANGEL

Who needs bullets?
THE PORT SIDE.

On the foredeck of an attack ship, Helmut is being strapped into
an elaborate harness -- it's a monstrous catapult!

Several pirates struggle to lock the huge launching arm into
firing position. Helmut climbs onto the catapult and buckles
the straps.
HELMUT
Ready.

A pirate yanks out the retaining pin and the arm rockets
forward, launching Helmut up to deck level...

THE DECK.

Helmut slams into the rail with a THUD. He hoists himself over.
Helen moves to intercept him, but he BLASTS a cover of automatic
fire. Immediately, he clips a series of block and tackle
pulleys along the rail.

Below, pirates grabs the ropes and hoist up more ATTACKERS...

Morgan runs to sabotage the beachhead. But Helmut SPRAYS the
deck with an entire clip. Morgan somersaults behind a vent. He
peeks around his cover and stares at Helmut -- pure pirate, lost
beyond hope of salvation.

wanda calis out to Morgan, holding up her gun.

WANDA
No more bullets!

looks around at the stupendous volume. It's an enormous empty

each other for a moment. Eye to eye. Morgan takes a breath.
Then he turns the shotgun around and hands it to Helmut.

MORGAN
If you're not my son, shoot me,

His voice ECHOES eerily in the vast chamber. Helmut stares in
disbelief for a moment. He takes the gun. Morgan is calm,
accepting. Helmut raises the weapon. Aims it. Morgan has not
blinked. Helmit's finger tightens around the trigger...

Now Morgan closes his eyes. Impulsively, Helmut swings the gun
out sideways into the void. He pulls the trigger...

It was empty. Morgan and Helmut pokerface each other.

MORGAN
You think I'd give a loaded gun to a
pirate?

A beat. Was that a joke? Helmut looks at the man across from
him. Morgan's face is enigmatic. Is that a grimace or the hint
of a smile?

Then, simultaneously, as if by psychic command, both men dive
for Helmut's gun...

...it's skids further away. Helmut grapples. Morgan kicks it.

Now, a great THUD comes down from above. Pirates have opened
the large overhead door. Morgan glances up... -

Pirates begin to rappelle down ropes, like spiders. They FIRE
their automatics. The sound ECHOES in the vast cavern, building
into an excruciating CACOPHONY of overlapping explosions...

Morgan notices a small door. It's his only hope. He dives for
it, wrenching open the lock wheel, SLAMMING it behind...

Morgan has entered some kind of air-lock. Another door. He

..Lazlo is still holding the barbed hook in Morgan's back...
.. below them, the lethal blades spin furiously...

.two men suspended one from the other like chain links...

..-blood is pouring out of Morgan's shoulder which has swollen
up like a small pumpkin. The barb is still firmly lodged...

.. Morgan's fingers begin to slip off the balcony. They're wet
with perspiration...

..-his face is in agony...

..-he can’t take it anymore, looks up to the lunar eclipse for a
split second and...
...-releases... so Lazlo also releases...

-.-buc, from nowhere, Blake clamps down on Morgan's forearm,
hauling him up...

..-While Lazlo continues plunging downwards. His cape of
feathers filling up like a parachute...

For an instant, Lazlo looks like he is trying to fly...

-..then, he hits the water. The moonlit foam becomes sanguine
as Lazlo is shredded mercilessly by the rotors. The feathers
spin up and slowly settle on a liquid carpet of blood...

...Blake helps his father onto the platform...

BLAKE

We've got to get this hook out of you.
MORGAN

No time. Let's go...
BLAKE

No, wait. Trust me. It's the only way.

Morgan looks at his son. He shuts his eyes in anticipation.
Blake grips the barb and twists it out counter-clockwise.
Morgan grimaces, clenching his teeth. His knees are weak.
Blake holds up the barb and wire. He tosses it overboard.

CuT TO:
THE BRIDGE TERRACE.
A pair of pirates are launched up on the catapult, while Wanda
and Helen are ducking a SPRAY OF COVERFIRE. Immediately, the
pirates hook up the standard block and tackle pulleys. They're
going to take the bridge!!! Helen and Wanda take cover...

"cur To:

VERTICAL SHAFT.
Angel and Troy are helping Morgan and Blake -- the two wounded
warriors -- up a ladder stairwell...

CUT TO:

INSIDE THE BRIDGE.

Enola is looking through the telescope. Her expression suddenly
becomes panicky...
ENOLA
It's there!! It's there!!!
POV THROUGH SCOPE.

Sure enough, a tiny bump is emerging from the curved shadow.
About thirty degrees north of the "Equator."

ON CORNELIUS.
He holds up the sextant. He looks confused...

ENOLA {0.S.)
Quick. It's disappearing...
CORNELIUS
(sheepish)
Iocan't do it. I don't know how to
use a sextant.

Enola grabs it from him, puts it up to her eye, measuring...

At that instant, the door is KICKED open. A squad of pirates
burst inside, with Helen and Wanda as prisoner...

PIRATE
Everybody freeze.
A pirate grabs Enola viciously by the hair. The sextant goes
flying...
But now Blake emerges from the hatch.
BLAKE

I'll take the prisoners. Lazlo wants
you below...

They eye him suspiciously.

BLAKE
On the double!!

The men start filing down the hatch. He points to the women and
Cornelius.
BLAKE
Qutside!! Onto the terrace...

Helen begins to resist but then notices Morgan signaling to her
from outside. He lobs a Molitov cocktail into hatch after the
other pirates. Everyone dives outside as...

...the bridge EXPLODES in a massive fireball...

MORGAN
(to HELEN)
My son's alive and kicking!

OUTSIDE.

Everybody has converged on the mezzanine deck, The group races
down the central catwalk, descending onto the runway.

Meanwhile, the second wave of pirates are hoisting themselves up
onto the deck from boats below. Waves of killers are converging
on them...

The group runs and piles into the small pontoon plane, but at
the last instant, Cornelius balks...

(CONT. )
CORNELIUS
I'm not going! I'm staying with the
ship...
MORGAN

Are you crazy? They'll kill you...

GUNFIRE begins to pepper around them. Pirates are swarming the
ship, getting closer and closer...

TROY
Who's going to swim the airship??
They'11 kill us all...

CORNELIUS
I’m willing take my chances...

Suddenly, Angel pulls out a flare gun and shoots down onto the
deck, igniting her fuse. It begins to burn, a straight line
right down the runway towards the massive fuel reservoirs...

ANGEL
I just made your chances zero. Ina
couple heartbeats this whole fucking
ship's gonna blow up. Now get your
ass into the airship.

CORNELIUS
Oh not! Oh no... you shouldn't have
done that... They never taught me to
fly!! I don't know how it works...

Everyone looks at each other in a stunned silence. The flaming

fuse races Onwar -- about forty seconds to go. Morgan suddenly
grabs Cornelius and stuffs him into the pilot's seat.
MORGAN
Learn fastt!

IN THE COCKPIT

Cornelius looks around in utter panic. He flips a few switches.
Nothing. Wanda looks like she's gonna be sick...

THE FUSE.
Racing along... thirty seconds.

THE DECK.

Pirates are within forty yards of the plane.
CORNELIUS -

Sweating profusely. Tries a few more switches.
Helen shakes her head in disbelief...

THE FUSE.

SSSBSSSSSEESS.......~

THE COCKPIT.

Suddenly, a HAND reaches in from outside and grabs Cornelius.
It's a VICIOUS PIRATE, trying to yank him out. Cornelius
struggles, flails his arms...hits something...

..-CHUG...GHUG...CHUG... the props begin to turnll It was the
Starter! His hands slap something else -- the throttle...

The plane lurches forward. The pirate loses his grip, slips
back onto the pontoon...

The airship begins to rattle along the runway...

THE DECK.

...the plane catches up to the burning fuse. They're running
neck and neck -- but will the plane clear the runway before the
fuse hits those gasoline tanks?

CHUG...CHUG...CHUG...The pirate is dragged along with them.
IN THE COCKPIT.
Cornelius is shaking with fear.

CORNELIUS
I think we're too heavy. We'll never
take off!!

LONGSHOT. THE DECK.

The fuse burns across the frame in the foreground. The plane
runs parallel with it, behind. It’s a dead heat. But there's
only about fifty feet of runway left, and the wheels haven't
left the ground...

...they're not going to make it!!
...the plane pours over the lip of the deck, falling...
..-down towards the sea...

...the pirate dangling onto the pontoon skims the water. He's
forced to release. Then, the plane suddenly surges upwards...

IN THE COCKPIT.
Cornelius smiles triumphantly,

CORNELIUS
See? Too heavy... I told you...

me. KAabooommll!

Tne ships explodes in a massive fireball, which mushrooms up and
out, singeing the plane. The airship surges upwards into the
heavens, leaving the flaming ship below like a tiny patch of
glowing lava in a sea of blackness...

CONTINUED:
97.
(CONT. }

Smiles and SIGHS of relief. Morgan has his arm around his son.

MORGAN
What about the coordinates, Cornelius?

CORNELIUS
Ask the girl...

Everyone turns to Enola. She hesitates.

HELEN
(anxious)
You got them didn’t you, Enola?
A moment of suspense. Then, Enola turns to Morgan, smiling
proud. wane
“ ENOLA
- Twelve degrees above the horizon...
™  corNELIUS
It’s right behind us!! We should
reach it by sunrise...

But, in the excitement, he's released the stick. The plane goes
into a nauseating nosedive. He pulls her back up, sending
everyone's stomach through the basement...

DISSOLVE To:
THE OCEAN, DAY.

The pontoon plane flies towards us erratically. The engine
SPITS a few times. Now, the plane begins a wobbling descent.
It hits with water with a SPLASHY GEYSER, somewhere between a
nosedive crash and a picture-perfect touchdown...

But why are they landing? It's the middle of nowhere...
Wait. Are those birds?

Look, a school of dolphin is surrounding the plane like a
welcoming committee. The group piles out LAUGHING, CHEERING.
Morgan's shoulder is bandaged...

They are wading in the water!!! A sand shelf...

WE TURN 180 degrees TO REVEAL, the most beautiful, inviting
island you can imagine...

WATER'S END!!!

Not just one, but a string of islands. A tropical
archipelago...

The troupe re-enters the shot, frolicking in shallow water.
They make their way onto the beach, GIGGLING like children.

It's hard to maintain balance on terra firma after a lifetime of
sea legs. They fall into the sand and roll around. There's aa
small shack in the background...

CONTINUED:
98.
(CONT. )

...and now Morgan stands, looking in disbelief. A heard of wild
horses gallop past them on the beach...

DISSOLVE TO:
THE SHACK.
Angel and Wanda step inside. Dark and dusty. Some rotting
furniture. Then they notice some bones, a skull. Ebony black.

WANDA
Blackbone...

ANGEL
That's why they set her adrift.
CUT TO:
OUTSIDE.
Everyone is LAUGHING, playing in the sand. Cornelius stands up
suddenly agitated...

CORNELIUS
Goodness, I've forgotten my calender.
How will I keep track of the days.

BLAKE

Why don't we just call this day number
one...

Blake moves up to Morgan and hugs him.
DISSOLVE TO:

THE APEX OF WATER'S END.

Enola has made it to the peak of the mountain. She can see the
other's way below her on the beach...

She notices something planted in the earth. A bit of cloth ona
stake. She unfurls it -- a Union Jack, tattered and torn.
Below it, is a metal plaque. Enola wipes off the dirt. It
reads: :

Edmund Hillary
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay
May 29, 1953

Enola studies it curiously. She stands, wipes her hands...

WE PULL BACK HIGHER AND HIGHER into the air like a soaring bird,
Enola standing triumphant on the mountaintop.

ENOLA
{co herself}
Now I'm really home. .

AS WE SPIRAL UPWARDS into the heavens, the string of islands
stretch out below us like an earthly paradise...

FADE TO BLACK.
