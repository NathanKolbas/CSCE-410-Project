Devlin/Emmerich Draft 7/6/93
FADE IN:
PRIMITIVE SKETCHES E.C.U.
Etched on stone, a JACKAL. Another of a GAZELLE, a spear
piercing its skin. Primitive, yet dramatic tribal etchings.
The SOUND of ancient CHANTING is HEARD. Widen to REVEAL...
EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE, NORTH AFRICA - SUNSET 1
A young BOY chisels his artwork into the stone ROCKFACE at
the edge of this valley. An old MEDICINE MAN, his face
painted with bizarre white stripes, CHANTS nearby.
The boy abruptly stops his work at the SOUND of distant CRIES.
Quickly he climbs the stone. Standing at the top he SEES...
HUNTERS.
RETURNING FROM A KILL. THEY MARCH TOWARDS A SMALL CAMPSITE. 2
The tribes people rushing to greet them.

Super up: North Africa 8000 B.C.
OMITTED 3
A BLAZING FIRE - LATER THAT NIGHT 4
Silhouetted tribesmen dancing in bizarre animal MASKS. Feet
STOMPING. The young Boy stares at the fire, SPARKS rising
into the air. We PAN UP following the sparks into the sky.
A full moon.
A SHADOW is suddenly cast across the moon, blotting it out.
INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 5

The young Boy sleeps. Above him hangs an odd carving that
slowly begins to RATTLE. The tent's fabric begins to FLAP.

The Boy's eyes pop open. He HEARS the sounds of a quickly

brewing storm. Footsteps. People hurrying, calling out to
each other. Suddenly the tent's entrance flap SAILS OPEN.

BRIGHT LIGHT pours in through the entrance.

EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 6

The Boy exits his tent, staring at the light, intrigued. A
storm building all around. Unnatural and eerie.

Panicked, the tribesmen run in fear, racing away from the
light. The Medicine man, on his knees CHANTING.
10

11

The only one without fear, the Boy pushes through them,
towards the light. Tents begin to RIP from their posts in
the strong GALE WINDS.

As the frightened clan retreats, the young Boy moves closer
and closer to the light, squinting through the blurring sands.
A loud ROARING SOUND, building in ferocity.

Slowly we PUSH into an extreme CLOSE UP of the young Boy's
eyes which widen. If we could only see what he sees...

SMASH BLACK OUT:

FADE IN:
OMITTED 7
THE GREAT PYRAMID - SUNSET 8

A glowing orange setting SUN just above the pyramid's peak.
A car drives past.

Super up: GIZA, EGYPT - 1928
INT. CAR - SUNSET 9
PROFESSOR LANGFORD and his nine year old daughter CATHERINE,
who reads from a thick text book, are RATTLING in the back
seat.
EXT. DIGGING SITE - GIZA - SUNSET 10

The car SCREECHES to a halt. The passenger door opens and
Professor Langford JUMPS out. Catherine follows.

As they make their way down the ravine we slowly reveal the
breadth of this work site. Hundreds of Arab men digging
away in the sand.

FOREMAN TAYLOR 11
Is crouched on the ground dusting off three large TABLETS

covered in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Professor Langford
walks up behind him, staring in awe.

TAYLOR
Cover stones. We found them this
afternoon.

LANGFORD

Amazing. But why did you move them?

Catherine walks over to a small table, examining other
artifacts. She picks up a small GOLDEN SUN DISK; a circular
SYMBOL of the sun emblazoned on a gold disk.
12

16

TAYLOR
There was something hidden underneath.

LANGFORD
Hidden?

Taylor leads Langford over to a large digging pit several

yards away. Slowly we TRACK across the sand, over the lip

of the digging pit revealing a handful of workers struggling

to secure ropes onto something hidden beyond our view.

Suddenly the ropes grow taut as they begin to lift.

LARGE METALLIC RING 12
over twenty feet in diameter. The RING is slowly lifted out

of the pit revealing its shape and structure. It doesn't

seem to belong to ancient Egypt.

And perhaps not even this world.

ANGLE - TAYLOR AND LANGFORD 13

As they stare in wonder at this newly found treasure. Young
Catherine squeezes in between the two.

LANGFORD
(whispering)
What is that thing, Taylor?

TAYLOR
I wish I knew.

THE RING 14

as it's lifted upright, suspended above them. An amazing
sight.

CATHERINE 15

Staring, fascinated. Suddenly the lenses of her glasses
CRACK.

CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - RAIN - DAY 16

A cold rainy winter day. Traffic gridlock. Horns honking,
cabbies yelling. A grey LIMOUSINE is stuck in traffic.

Super up: NEW YORK, PRESENT DAY Through the rain-soaked
passenger window we see an ELDERLY WOMAN impatiently checking
her watch. Unheard by us, she speaks to her DRIVER who exits
and opens the passenger door for her.

Taking an umbrella from her driver, the Elderly Woman steps
out and makes her way down the center of the street.
17

4.

We FOLLOW her through the dense traffic and up into a building
marked: ARCHAEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME 17

Testing the microphone, the M.C. adjusts the feedback as he
leans close to address a gathering of distinguished
Archaeologists.

M.C.
Our next guest speaker today will be
an extraordinary young man...

BOOKS AND PAPERS 18
Clumsily this stack of books and papers are organized atop a

man's lap. Gathered together, they're lifted as the man
attempts to make his way out of his seat, down the aisle.

MALE VOICE
(sotto)
Excuse me... Pardon me...
M.C.

...He graduated with his masters at
the age of 20 and speaks eleven
different languages. He has written
several seminal articles on the
comparative linguistics of the Afro-
Asiatic language groups and the
development of the Egyptian language
from the Archaic Period to the Old
Kingdom. Please let me introduce to
you, Daniel Jackson.

CRASH. The books TUMBLE to the floor. As he leans down to

pick them up we SEE for the first time, DANIEL JACKSON,
nervously retrieving his belongings.

ANGLE - PROFESSORS 19
An older PROFESSOR leans over to his companion.

PROFESSOR
Ah, another Wunderkind.

COMPANION
I've got socks older than this kid.

Daniel makes his way to the microphone.
DANIEL
You, Sir. What kind of car do you
drive?

Daniel points to the Professor who made the remark.
20

21

PROFESSOR
My car? Um..a Ford.
DANIEL
A model T?
PROFESSOR
(peeved)

I'm not that old. It's an Escort.

DANIEL
An Escort. Power steering, fuel
injection. Modern "developments."
Ford starts with a model T then
"develops" into an Escort.

The audience doesn't get where Daniel's going with this.

DANIEL (CONT'D)

Why didn't Egyptian culture develop?
Their sciences, art, mathematics,
everything was complete from the

very beginning. Why? Maybe, Egyptian
civilization was not a "development"
but a legacy!

There is an audible REACTION from the crowd.
INT. HALLWAY - SAME 20

The Elderly Woman walks past the beautifully displayed
Egyptian artifacts.

DANIEL (0.S.)

The Mastaba tombs around the pyramid
are covered with hieroglyphics; names,
titles of owners, lists of offerings.

INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME 21

The Elderly Woman enters from the back of the room, her eyes
fixed on Daniel. Absently she fingers the GOLDEN SUN DISK
hanging from around her neck. This is CATHERINE LANGFORD,
no longer the child we met in Egypt.

DANIEL
But the pyramid, the greatest
structure ever erected, has no
writings whatsoever. Why?

An imposing older man, PROFESSOR THOMAS interrupts.

THOMAS
Mr. Jackson, you've conveniently
left out the fact that Colonel Vyse
discovered quarrymen's inscriptions
(MORE )
THOMAS (CONT'D)
of Khufu's name written within the
Pyramid.

DANIEL
His discovery was a fraud.

The room ERUPTS in angry dissent.

THOMAS
You can prove that, I hope?

With surprising speed, Daniel draws a series of hieroglyphics
on the black board behind the podium.

DANIEL
This was the cartouche Vyse claimed
to have found in the relieving
chambers above the King's Chamber of
the pyramid.

He circles the first symbol (a clear circle with a dot in
the middle).

DANIEL (CONT'D)
But this symbol, representing the
first consonant in the name Khufu is
incorrect. The correct symbol is...

He draws a circle with the center darkened.

DANIEL (CONT'D)

This is the same exact misspelling
of Khufu's name that appeared in
Wilkinson's Materia Hieroglphyica,
the book that Colonel Vyse used to
forge his big discovery. However,
in the very next edition of the same
book, they revised their translations
to correct this error.

(beat)
The editor of this book admit his
mistake but we, the academic
community, refuse to.

AS several people begin to get out of their seats and walk
out, another PROFESSOR (#2) jumps to his feet, incensed.

PROFESSOR #2
Don't you think it's rather arrogant
to suggest the last hundred years of
academic research is a collection of
lies?!
He stands
join him,

DANIEL
I'm simply saying that the great
pyramids of Giza were not built by
the Pharaohs of the fourth Dynasty.

PROFESSOR #3
This is ridiculous. I won't sit and
listen to this nonsense.

and exits the auditorium. As others in the audience
Catherine Langford steps forward.

CATHERINE
Mr. Jackson, who do you think built
the pyramids?

There is an awkward silence as Daniel searches for an answer.

DANIEL
I don't know.

A heavy set BEARDED MAN smiles and calls out.

BEARDED MAN
Men from Atlantis?

The audience ERUPTS IN LAUGHTER, cueing more people to stand.

BEARDED MAN (CONT'D)
Or Martians perhaps?!

DANIEL
I didn't say that...

BEARDED MAN
No, but you were about to.

More laughter. Daniel SEES more people filing out. Quickly
he tries to organize his notes but is clearly flustered.

DANIEL
If we could just get back to the
subject. Perhaps their civilization
lies in the buried Wadis of Western
Sahara. In the Predynastic period
these areas would have been rich
with food and animals. New geological
evidence pre-dates that Sphinx to a
much earlier period, confirming my
hypothesis.. But as Daniel looks up
from his material he SEES the last
several people left in the room,
filing out the back door.
22

WIDE ANGLE - DANIEL AT PODIUM 22

Alone in the room, Daniel stands at the podium. Sadly he
slowly closes his text.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Any questions?

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE - SUBWAY EXIT - LATE AFTERNOON 23

Alone in a crowd, Daniel struggles with his books in the

rain as he exits the busy subway exit. Absently he steps

out into the street. HONK. A cab slams on the brakes, nearly
hitting him.

CABBIE
Wake up you idiot!

Startled, Daniel hurries out of harms way as he passes a
small FRUIT STAND. The ARMENIAN owner greets Daniel in his
native language, tossing him an apple.

Daniel responds with fluid ARMENIAN as he catches the apple
on his way over to an old brownstone building.

He steps around a grey LIMOUSINE double parked in front of
his building as he makes his way inside.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 24

Dripping wet, Daniel steps into the hallway. He stops as he
HEARS opera music playing through an open door at the end of
the hallway.

Slowly he makes his way to the open door only to find,
Catherine Langford, sitting inside, relaxed and smoking a
cigarette. She holds in her hand a bust of a beautiful
Egyptian woman.

CATHERINE
(re: bust)
14th century, B.C. Nice reproduction.

INT. DANIEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 25
Taken off guard, Daniel walks into his apartment. His room

is a mess, multiple stacks of BOOKS line every wall,
hieroglyphic tracings and reproductions of Egyptian art.

DANIEL
How did you get in here?
CATHERINE
Your landlord told me you're three
months behind in your rent, shame on
you.

Daniel puts down his drenched text books and removes his
dripping overcoat.

DANIEL
You were at the lecture.

Catherine returns the bust to a table next to a PHOTO of a
young couple.

CATHERINE
Your parents?
DANIEL
Foster.
CATHERINE
Oh, right. Your real parents died
in a plane crash in...'73?

She holds her cigarette out, requesting an ash tray.

DANIEL
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?
Why are you here?

Daniel puts a dead potted plant in front of Catherine.
Reluctantly she puts her cigarette out in its dirt.

CATHERINE
To offer you a job.

DANIEL
A job? What job?

CATHERINE
Translation. I want to put you to
work on some ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics.

DANIEL
(suspicious)
Since when is the military interested
in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics?

CATHERINE
(surprised)
Who said anything about the military?

Daniel walks close to her, defiantly.
26

10.

DANIEL
In front of my building is a grey
Lincoln town car with government
plates. Its chauffeur is wearing a
crewcut 'stead of a black cap. And
the only way you could have gotten
past my Nazi of a landlord was to
flash some pretty fancy credentials.
(beat)

So why is the military interested in
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics?

Catherine is clearly impressed. She smiles.

CATHERINE
I wish I could tell you more but I
am not allowed.

DANIEL
What makes you think I'd take a job
I don't know anything about?

CATHERINE
You mean beyond the fact that you
have no family, no friends, and no
hope of paying that stack of bills
sitting on your desk?
Daniel sneaks a sidelong glance at his mountain of mail.

DANIEL
Well, uh, yes.

Catherine stands, walks closer to Daniel. She pulls out a
snapshot from her bag and holds it in front of his face.

CATHERINE
To prove that your theories are right.

THE PHOTO 26
A snapshot of the tablets found at Giza in 1928.

Mesmerized Daniel grabs at the photo, but Catherine quickly
pulls it away. She knows she's hooked him. She hands hima
stuffed envelope, instead.

DANIEL
What's this?

CATHERINE
Your travel plans.

She turns and heads for the door. Daniel calls out to her.

DANIEL
I'm not big on flying.
27

28

11.

CATHERINE (0.S.)
Get over it.

Daniel watches her walk away, then stares at the envelope.

CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 27
A dark sedan with a GOVERNMENT SEAL comes to a stop in front
of a lower middle-class suburban house. Two OFFICERS in
military garb step out of the car and march to the front
door of the house.

Super up: Yuma, Arizona

As they walk, we SEE a black military FOLDER one of them
carries. The first Officer knocks on the door.

The door opens to reveal, SARAH, mid-thirties, tense. The
pain she carries tarnishes her once beautiful face.

OFFICER #1
Mrs O'Neil?

Seeing the Officer's military attire, she nods, moving away
from the door.

SARAH
Come on in.

Sarah disappears into the house. The two Officers exchange
a glance and follow her inside.

INT. O'NEIL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 28

Immaculately kept, ordered. Sarah moves into the kitchen as
the two officers awkwardly make their way into the living
room.

OFFICER #1
Uh, Mrs O'Neil, is your husband at
home?

She answers from the kitchen where she continues her chores.

SARAH
Yes.

OFFICER #1
Do you think we might be able to
speak with him?

SARAH
You can try.
29

30

31

32

12.

Still she continues to clean in the kitchen. After a long
beat...

OFFICER #1
And where would we find him?

SARAH
Last door, end of the hall.

The Officer nods his appreciation as he and his partner head
down the hall.

OFFICER'S P.O.V. - DOWN HALL 29

As they make their way down the hall, they reach an open
doorway at the hall's end. Peering in they SEE, a teenage
boy's room. Perfectly kept. Sports trophies, footballs,
etc.

As we TRACK across the room's belongings we FIND a man sitting
in a chair facing the window, his back towards us.

OFFICER #1
Excuse me, Colonel O'Neil? We're
from General West's office.
But the man in the chair doesn't turn around.

OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
Colonel?

REVERSE ANGLE - COLONEL JACK O'NEIL 30
For the first time we see COLONEL JACK O'NEIL, long hair,

six day growth, intense and troubled eyes. There is nothing
military looking about this guy. He stares vacantly out the
window.

OFFICER #1 (CONT'D)
Sir?

INT. KITCHEN - SARAH'S P.O.V. - MOMENTS LATER 31
Sarah looks out the kitchen window and SEES the two Officers
returning to their car outside. Sarah turns and slowly walks

to the back of the house.

As she approaches an open bedroom door, she stops, peers
inside.

P.0O.V. - INTO BEDROOM 32

The black FOLDER laying on the bed. A pressed military
UNIFORM is laid down next to the folder.
33

34
35

36

37

13.
Pained, Sarah shuts her eyes and turns away.
CUT TO:
EXT. MOUNTAIN FOREST - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY 33
Quickly, we SAIL over the treetops through this dense forest
area. At the edge of the treeline we FIND a beat up and
bruised Chevy, sputtering up the windy mountain road.
Super up: Creek Mountain, Colorado
OMITTED 34
EXT. GUARDED GATEWAY - DAY 35
The Chevy pulls up to a gate where two MARINES stand guard.
One walks up to Daniel's window. Daniel opens the envelope
Catherine gave him and hands some papers to the Guard.
DANIEL
Daniel Jackson. I think I'm supposed
to show this to.. SNEEZE. Daniel
grabs for a Kleenex.

GUARD
Cold?

DANIEL
No. Allergies. Always happens when
I travel.

EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY 36
A group of MARINES are in the midsts of vigorous training.

Led by LIEUTENANT KAWALSKY, early thirties, big, friendly

and eager.

With a loud BACKFIRE, we SEE the Chevy making its way past.

Lt. Kawalsky signals for another soldier to take over, then
heads after Daniel.

As he walks away, the others stop and watch.

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - SAME 37
Tunneled into the side of a mountain, a large hollowed

entrance. Daniel has parked next to it and is struggling to
pull an enormous bag out of his trunk.

KAWALSKY
Daniel Jackson?

Startled, Daniel turns to see Kawalsky rushing up. Kawalsky
grabs and shakes Daniel's hand.
38

39

40

41

42

14.
KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
Dr. Langford was worried you changed
your mind.

DANIEL
It took me three days to drive.

Again Daniel tries to lift his bag out but he can't.

KAWALSKY
Help you with that?

He reaches in for Daniel's bag.

DANIEL
Careful, books, they're very...

Effortlessly Kawalsky lifts the bag out with one hand,
SLAMMING the trunk down shut with the other.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
.. heavy.

He follows Kawalsky into the tunnel.

INT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - SUNSET 38
DANIEL follows Kawalsky into the dark tunnel. Two large
CONCRETE DOORS open to reveal a METAL SHACK, a GUARD standing
alongside it. The guard hits a button on the desk and shack
OPENS exposing a STEEL CAGE inside. They walk over and enter.
INT. STEEL CAGE - CONTINUOUS 39

Suddenly with a loud hydraulic ROAR, the cage quickly DESCENDS
DOWNWARD. We WATCH as the cage DROPS down, deeper and deeper.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - THROUGH CAGE 40

Daniel counts the LARGE NUMBERS painted on the shaft walls
as they descend. They pass 18, 19, 20... so on.

Daniel tries to take it all in. Suddenly the cage STOPS.

The number reads 28. The two and the eight are separated as

the DOORS OPEN.

DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - UNDERGROUND STRUCTURE - SAME 41

Several sterile hallways lead towards us, active with foot
traffic.

INT. HALLWAY - TRACKING - CONTINUOUS 42
Daniel follows Kawalsky down the main hallway.

Walking out of an open office door is MEYERS, a balding middle-
aged scientist who extends his hand to Daniel as they walk.
43

44

15.

MEYERS
Mr. Jackson, Dr. Gary Meyers.

DANIEL
Hi. Where am I?

FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
A nuclear missile silo.

Daniel turns to find BARBARA SHORE, late-thirties, walking
up alongside him.

SHORE
Don't worry. It's been completely
converted. Barbara Shore. The token
Astrophysicist on the team.

Kawalsky stops at the end of the hall, turning back to Daniel.

KAWALSKY
This is where you'll be working.

Kawalsky opens the door. They all enter.
INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS 43

Daniel's eyes widen. A large workroom. The walls are covered
with charcoal rubbings and photo enlargements of
hieroglyphics. On two large tables are various artifacts.

Meyers moves over to the back wall and pulls down a sheet
that was covering...

THE GIZA TABLETS (FROM THE OPENING) 44

The Giza tablets have been fastened to the wall. Daniel is
truly amazed, hypnotized. Standing near the tablets,
Catherine looks up from some papers and walks over to Daniel.

CATHERINE
Glad you decided to join us.

DANIEL
Where did you find them?

CATHERINE
Giza Plateau. 1928.
(pointing out parts
of tablets)
There are two lines of hieroglyphs.
The outer edge which has some familiar
figures, as you can see.

She points to a chalk board next to the hieroglyphics that
has a loose translation; YEAR 10 OF KING ?, SKY, RA, THE SUN
DISK, COFFIN, DOOR TO HEAVEN.
16.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
And then there is the inner track,
here. These symbols, as you can
see, are unlike any ever found.

(after a beat)

Like Champillion with the Rosetta
Stone, we tried to compare the two
readings against each other for any
similarities.

Daniel, still in awe, walks over to the translation, examining
it.

DANIEL
It's all wrong. what did you use,
Budge? Why do they keep reprinting
his books?

MEYERS
We tried decoding and translation
computer programs, used every known
technique, for years with no result...

Daniel erases the word TIME on the blackboard and replaces
it with the word YEARS. Peeved, Meyers steps forward.

MEYERS (CONT'D)
Excuse me.

Catherine stops him, watching Daniel, intrigued.

DANIEL
That's a curious word to use "qebeh."
Then an adverbial sedjem-en-ef with
a cleft subject "sealed and buried"...
(turning to Meyers)
NOT coffin.

Shore walks up next to Kawalsky, together they watch Daniel
work quickly re-working the translation.

MEYERS
(to Daniel)
What are you doing?!

DANIEL
"Forever to eternity for all time".
You really should have gotten that
one.

Shore looks over at Meyers with an "I told you so" attitude.
As Daniel steps back from the board we SEE he has nearly
completed the translation of the top part of the Tablets.
45

17.

DANIEL (CONT'D)

This should read, A MILLION YEARS
INTO THE SKY IS RA, SUN GOD. SEALED
AND BURIED FOR ALL TIME HIS...

Then Daniel circles the last word.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
It's not DOOR to HEAVEN. The proper
translation is... STARGATE.

There is a stunned beat. They can't believe how fast Daniel
can work. Slowly Daniel turns back to them.

DANIEL (CONT'D)

Alright, now will somebody please

tell me why the military has assembled
a team of archaeological scientists

in a nuclear missile silo on top of
mount nowhere to study five thousand
year old Egyptian tablets?

O'NEIL (0.S.)
My report says, ten thousand.

The group turns to SEE...
COLONEL O'NEIL 45

Dressed in full military attire, his hair cropped tight, the
Colonel, in sharp contrast to the man we met before, is now
the very image of the spit-and-polish soldier.

DANIEL
Ten thousand?

Everyone turns, surprised at this intrusion. Clearly the
others in the room do not recognise O'Neil. Kawalsky snaps
to attention.

KAWALSKY
Sir.

O'NEIL
At ease.

O'Neil opens the black folder, removes some papers and hands
them over to Kawalsky.

CATHERINE
Excuse me, do I know...

O'NEIL
Jack O'Neil from General West's
office. I'll be taking over from
now on.
18.

Shocked, Catherine turns to Kawalsky who looks up at the
papers and nods; it's true. Daniel could care less about
the changing of the guard and steps forward.

DANIEL
Wait a minute. Ten thousand? That's
impossible. Egyptian civilization
didn't even exist until...

SHORE
We know, but the sonic and Radiocarbon
tests are conclusive. Look at these
artifacts from associated and
overlying strata. Clearly
Epipaleolithic or Neolithic, probably
related to the Natufian in Palestine.
Entirely consistent with the Ninth
to Tenth Millennium B.C. date.

DANIEL
These are cover stones. Was there a
tomb underneath?

MEYERS
No. But we found something much
more interesting.

O'Neil interrupts, stepping between them.

O'NEIL
Excuse me, but this information has
become classified.

MEYERS
(confused)
Catherine, what's going on here?

CATHERINE
I'm not sure.

O'NEIL
From now on, no information will be
passed on to non military personnel
without my expressed permission.

DANIEL
You can't be serious. This is
ludicrous. What the hell am I doing
here?

O'NEIL
You're a translator, so translate.
Lieutenant, I want all information
not directly pertaining to these
tablets to be removed and brought to
my office immediately.
46

19.
O'Neil turns for the exit.

KAWALSKY
Your office, Sir?

O'NEIL
(turning back)
And I'll need an office.

KAWALSKY
Yes Sir!

Kawalsky rushes for the door and leads O'Neil out.
O'Neil marches out. The group exchange confused glances.

MEYERS
Who is this guy?

CATHERINE
I'll handle this.

Catherine goes running after O'Neil. Meyers and Shore exit
behind her leaving a confused Daniel alone with the Tablets.

DANIEL
(to himself)
Ten thousand?

CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 46

Kawalsky leads O'Neil down the hallway. From the rear,
Catherine rushes to catch up.

CATHERINE
Colonel, just a minute.
(O'Neil stops)
I think you owe me some kind of
explanation. I was told I'd have
complete autonomy.

O'NEIL
Plans change.

CATHERINE
Why?

O'NEIL

Things have gotten too loose around
here. You've even brought in another
civilian.

CATHERINE
Jackson was approved.
47

20.

O'NEIL
To translate. That's all.

CATHERINE
This has nothing to do with Jackson,
does it? What's this all about? why
did they bring you in?

At first he doesn't want to answer. Finally he decides to
tell her the truth.

O'NEIL
I'm here in case you succeed.

O'Neil turns and walks away.

CUT TO:
INT. LAB - NIGHT 47

To the strains of seventeenth century opera music pouring

out of a ghetto blaster, we PAN across the darkened lab.
Daniel's belongings are spread throughout the room, including
his Egyptian bust. Open books scattered all over the floor.
The room is a mess.

AS we see the Tablets, we TRACK UP the scaffolding surrounding
it until we find Daniel, laying by the top of the Tablets.
Daniel, looking harried and tired, is deep in thought.

KAWALSKY (0.S.)
Do you have a problem with the food
here? You've barely eaten in days.

Daniel leans over the edge of the scaffolding and SEES
Kawalsky standing below, a tray of food in his hands.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
You want anything else?

DANIEL
A point of reference. Some context.
You want me to solve a puzzle but
you won't give me the clues.

KAWALSKY
You know I'm under strict orders.

DANIEL
So disobey orders. You know what
Shakespeare said, "Let them obey
that know not how to rule."

Kawalsky calmly puts the tray of food down on the desk
48

49

50

51

21.

KAWALSKY
Must be tough to always be the
smartest person in the room.

Kawalsky turns and exits. Frustrated, Daniel lays back down
onto the scaffolding.

Daniel rolls over and climbs down the scaffolding and walks
over to a table. He grabs the coffee pot only to find it
empty. Carrying the pot with him, Daniel exits the lab.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 48

Just as he steps out of the lab, a NIGHT WATCHMAN looks up
from his post. Daniel holds the empty pot up.

DANIEL
Out of water.

The Watchman nods as Daniel moves down the hall.
INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE O'NEIL'S OFFICE - NIGHT 49

Turning the corner, pot in hand, Daniel passes O'Neil's
office; O'Neil's name freshly painted on the door. Checking
to see that he's unobserved, Daniel walks up to the office
door.

Daniel examines a KEYPAD at the side of the door. He reaches
into his pocket and pulls out a small pair of nail clippers.

He jimmies the top of the pad open with the clippers and

jams them into the wiring, SPARKS jump. Suddenly the office

door glides OPEN.

INT. O'NEIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 50

Like his home, O'Neil's office is immaculately kept. Daniel
creeps inside, scanning the room.

He SEES a file cabinet and rushes over to it. But as he
opens its drawers he finds they are all empty.

Daniel opens the closet door and finds a large SAFE, very
high security. He looks down at the tiny nail clippers still
in his hand. No way.

Casually Daniel goes through the desk drawers, but again,
empty. Finally in the last drawer he finds a photo of
O'Neil's wife and son. Suddenly the GLOW of a computer screen
catches his eye. Daniel picks up the keyboard and starts
typing.

MONITOR - INSERT 51

Below the words, UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, Daniel types
the word "query" a highlight list appears. Daniel moves the
highlight over the word PERSONNEL. The word SEARCH appears.

Daniel types in COLONEL JACK O'NEIL. The computer responds,
PLEASE WAIT...

Impatiently Daniel waits. Suddenly the SHADOW of a guard is
SEEN through the door. Daniel FREEZES. The guard passes.
Daniel looks back down to the computer and sees...

O'NEIL, JACK - COLONEL - RETIRED, TWO YEARS - RETURNED ACTIVE
DUTY, ONE MONTH.

Daniel types something into the computer but the only response

he gets is; CLASSIFIED.

Frustrated, Daniel shuts the desktop and moves towards the
exit. But just as he's about to walk out the door, he spots
something on the wall, back up.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - A STAR MAP

of the known universe. Several of the star constellations
marked out in white. Daniel reaches up and the Star Map
gets violently RIPPED from the wall.

COMPUTER SCANNER

A bar of WHITE LIGHT scans across the table top, over the
STAR MAP.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:
INT. LAB - MINUTES LATER

Stuffing his face with a SNICKERS BAR, DANIEL sits behind
the bank of computers, working furiously.

MONITOR

The screen FILLS with the image of one of the hieroglyphics.
We PAN UP from the computer to see it on the TABLETS just
beyond the screen.

Quickly Daniel punches something up on the computer. The
computer screen SPLITS putting the image of the hieroglyphs
on one side and the map's ORION star constellation on the
other.

Making some adjustments on the computer, Daniel ROTATES the
image from the Star Map until it forms the SAME SHAPE AS THE
HIEROGLYPHIC. They are, in fact, the same symbol!

Daniel turns to his Egyptian bust.

DANIEL
Bingo!

MILITARY LIMOUSINES

Sliding to a stop. Dust. Doors opening. Stepping out of
the limos we SEE a DOZEN high ranking military OFFICIALS.

EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY

The group of OFFICIALS move towards the tunnel entrance. As
they march we see that they surround GENERAL WEST, 50's.
The group disappears inside.

INT. SILO - HALLWAY - SAME - DAY

Kawalsky leads Daniel, who carries a stack of papers, down
the hall. Kawalsky stops, opens a door marked BRIEFING ROOM.
Daniel enters.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The Briefing room is packed; O'Neil, Catherine, Meyers, Shore
and all the OFFICIALS we saw entering the compound. At the
center of the conversation is General West.

Daniel clearly wasn't expecting such an audience.

CATHERINE
Daniel, I'd like you to meet General
West.

GENERAL WEST
I've come a long way to hear this.
Let's see what you've got.

Daniel turns to Catherine who nods for Daniel to go ahead.
Daniel unfurls O'Neil's star map. Daniel circles one of the
constellations.

DANIEL
This is a star constellation. Orion.
Identical to a symbol on the Tablets.

The scientists exchange interested looks.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
The symbols on the Tablets were not
words. They were constellations.
Put together in a meticulous and
unique order, forming an address.

CATHERINE
An "address"? You mean coordinates?

DANIEL
Exactly. The centerpiece of the
tablets holds the key.

24.

Daniel draws the cartouche. Shore, Meyers and Catherine
exchange a look. Even O'Neil leans forward.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
This cartouche is a map. What we
have here are the seven points to
outline a course to a destination.

SHORE
Seven?

Daniel draws a diagram indicating the six points needed to
determine a destination (SEE DIAGRAM).

DANIEL

In order to find a destination in
any three dimensional space we need
to find two points to determine exact
height, two points for width, and
two points for depth. Those points
are indicated here...

(re: cartouche)
...with star constellations.

GENERAL WEST
You said you needed seven points?

DANIEL
Yes. While these symbols give us
our destination, in order to chart
our course we must have a point of
origin.

MEYERS
But there are only six symbols on
the cartouche.

DANIEL
That's because the point of origin
is not inside the cartouche but below
it, here.

Daniel circles a small symbol at the base of the cartouche.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
This here. This is the sign for
Earth. The point of origin. The
seventh symbol.

There is a long silence. Daniel waits for a response. It
is long in coming.

CATHERINE
(sly smile)
He did it.
60

61

25.

DANIEL
Did what?

SHORE
There is no symbol like that on the
device.

MEYERS
Perhaps some other kind of
representation?

DANIEL

What device?
Catherine turns to O'Neil and General.

CATHERINE
You'll have to show him. He's the
only one who can identify it.

DANIEL
Would someone please tell me what's
going on?

The General thinks a moment, turns to O'Neil.

GENERAL WEST
Show him.

O'Neil walks over to the back wall. He pushes a large BUTTON.
Suddenly the whole WALL SLIDES AWAY revealing a huge bay
window looking out at a much larger room below.

Surprised, Daniel turns. As Daniel walks over to the window
we PUSH IN TO SEE...

MISSILE SILO - DANIEL'S P.O.V. 60
Through the window we can see the converted missile silo

packed with high tech equipment. In the center of all this
technology sits...

THE METALLIC RING 61

This ring, the same one found in Egypt over sixty years ago,
now seems to be part of one gigantic functioning machine.

DANIEL
What the hell is that?

CATHERINE
Your "Star Gate."

GENERAL WEST
Take him downstairs. See if he can
identify this "seventh symbol."
62

26.

Catherine nods and leads Daniel and the others out of the
room, down to the silo. O'Neil and the General stay behind.

INT. SILO - MOMENTS LATER 62

Controlled chaos. This room looks much like "mission
control." Catherine escorts Daniel into the control booth.
He stares at the ring in total awe.

CATHERINE
While we didn't realize the symbols
were star constellations, it was
obvious to us that they match symbols
written on the star gate. Problem
was, we never knew about the seventh
symbol.

Through the observation window above, O'Neil and General
West watch as a video camera moves across a TRACK closing in
on the details of the Star Gate. General West turns to
O'Neil.

GENERAL
Jack, it's good to have you back.
(O'Neil nods)
How's your wife?

O'NEIL
Some days are alright, others aren't.

The General nods, understands.
ANGLE - DANIEL AND CATHERINE 63

Catherine leads Daniel next to a MONITOR that shows a detail
of the symbols written on the rim of the star gate. Daniel
stares at the screen, watching the symbols pass as the ring
slowly rotates.

DANIEL
Hold it!

Catherine turns, signals for the Star Gate to stop spinning.
Daniel walks closer to the monitor.

MONITOR - STARGATE E.C.U. - SYMBOLS 64

Lifting a black marker to the screen, Daniel draws the symbol
he found below the cartouche OVER a symbol seen on the screen.
Clearly this symbol is the other representation of the same
sign.

MEYERS
That's it. We must have been blind!

CATHERINE
Let's try it.
65

27.

Catherine picks up a phone. Above we SEE General West picking
up a phone from behind the observation glass. He nods.
Catherine hangs up.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
(announcing)
Let's run a test.

Over a Mic, Shore gives instructions to two TECNICIANS who
program the ring to TURN, front part and back in different
directions, aligning the sides. Each section stopping at a
particular sign, matching the cartouche.

Several ARMED GUARDS suddenly surround the star gate,
protecting it, from what, we don't know. A Technician opens
the top of the probe and places a caged RAT inside.

As each symbol aligns on the StarGate, a LASER ignites in
the center of the ring. Each additional laser builds the
intensity of the light. Daniel is amazed. He adjusts his
glasses to get a better look when they suddenly CRACK.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
I should have warned you about that.

DANIEL
(taking off his glasses)
Incredible.

As the Seventh Symbol is matched up, there is an audible
HUM. The lasers BRIGHTEN and a strange light TUNNEL begins
to form at the center of the ring.

SHORE
It's guiding itself. Can you believe
this?!

Suddenly every computer in the room begins to activate.
Lights FLASH, data PRINTS out, technicians rush to deal with
all the input. Shore turns around to SEE...

MAP ON THE BACK WALL OF THE CONTROL ROOM 65

A detailed schematic of the Universe. A small red laser
CROSS HAIR begins to trek across the map, leaving Earth and
traveling across the galaxy, stopping at the far end of the
screen.

SHORE (CONT'D)
Oh my God, the beam has locked onto
a point on the other side of our
Galaxy!

TECHNICIAN #2
It has mass. Could be a moon or
large asteroid.
28.

DANIEL
Where are we on that map?

CATHERINE
Blue dot.

The flashing BLUE DOT is all the way on the OTHER SIDE of
the screen, lower right corner.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
That's right, Daniel. The other
side of the known Universe.

A PROBE is brought over to a ramp that leads into the center
of the RING.

GENERAL WEST
(filtered through
microphone)
Release the Probe.

The crew finishes their last preparations and rushes away,
leaving the PROBE sitting on the ramp.

SHORE
Initiate count down.

A COMPUTER COUNTDOWN begins. The technicians put on large
DARK SECURITY GLASSES. Catherine hands a pair to Daniel who
reluctantly puts them on.

Suddenly the PROBE STARTS TO MOVE. The PROBE moves tank-
like across the ramp heading directly into the center of the
RING. As the countdown reaches the end, the PROBE moves
INTO THE RING. Suddenly there is an audible POWER SURGE.

BLINDING WHITE LIGHT flashes from the RING. Even with the
glasses, Daniel and the others cover their eyes.

Suddenly the PROBE VANISHES!

Shocked, Daniel looks to Catherine for an explanation. She
gives none.

A SECOND count down begins, counting down from 60... 59...
58... 57... With baited breath, the entire crew remains
motionless, waiting for the end of the countdown.

DANIEL
(whispered to Catherine)
What's happening?

CATHERINE
We're waiting for it to come back.

DANIEL
Come back?
29.

CATHERINE
Never has before.

32... 31... 30...

DANIEL
How is this possible?

CATHERINE
It's made out of a quartz unlike any
found on Earth. Some kind of natural
molecular disrupter. The device is
made out of it. It breaks down atoms
and sends them through another
dimension.

22... 21... 20...

DANIEL
How long have you guys been working
on this?

CATHERINE

My father found it when I was a child.
But the Egyptian government didn't
release it until '71. Then we had

to get it from the British. And

from there it took another ten years
to get financing.

DANIEL
From the Pentagon.

8... 7... 6...

The tension is thick. Everyone in the room is anxious,
waiting nervously.

3... 2... 1...

Through the ring, a vague SHADOW can be seen coming from the
other side. Slowly the shadow takes the form of THE PROBE,
moving slowly and steadily down the ramp.

Within seconds the ring TURNS ON ITS OWN and SHUTS DOWN.

The whole room explodes with CHEERS. The armed guards
surround the probe as it comes off the ramp. Two guards
immediately begin to examine it. One guard opens the top of
the probe, removing the caged RAT; still alive and well.

The technicians and crew members hug each other,
congratulating one another. Meyers rushes over to Daniel
shaking his hand, enthusiastically.

MEYERS
Congratulations. I mean it.
66

30.
Unlike everyone else, Daniel remains incredulous.

DANIEL
They're planning on going through,
aren't they?

CATHERINE
That's what this was all about.

Suddenly the phone rings. Catherine picks it up and tries
to listen through all the cheering going on around her.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
(yelling to room)
Quiet! Everyone!

The room settles down. As Catherine's expression darkens,
everyone in the room turns and looks at her, concerned.

Slowly we PAN UP to the observation window. Unheard by us,
O'Neil finishes his conversation with Catherine. Slowly the
wall LIFTS back up, COVERING the window.

Slowly Catherine hangs up the phone and turns back to her
cohorts.

CATHERINE (CONT'D)
We're done. They're sending us all
home. He said they're taking over
from here.

SHORE
What?!

Through the glass window of the control room we SEE...
TECHNICIANS - CATHERINE'S P.0O.V. THROUGH GLASS 66

Two Technicians move close to the probe. Suddenly several
of the armed guards block their path, rifles lifted. Behind
them Kawalsky instructs a guard who removes several DISKS
from the probe. Confused, the Technicians turn back to
Catherine.

MEYERS
They can't do this!

CATHERINE
Yes they can.

Sadly she turns away, trying to hide her disappointment.
Everyone is shocked as the armed guards, led by Kawalsky
take the probe out of the silo.

Daniel can't believe it. He turns and looks at the
crestfallen faces around him. With a strange resolve, Daniel
storms out.
31.

67 INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME 67
The door bursts open as Kawalsky and two of the armed guards
march in carrying the recording disks from the probe. They
pass O'Neil and General West.

GENERAL WEST
It's up to you now, Jack.

O'NEIL
I'll be ready. Oh-six hundred hours.

O'Neil turns and exits the room.
68 INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 68

Barely three steps out of the room, O'Neil is interrupted by
Daniel who races up, walking behind him.

DANIEL
Just what the hell do you think you're
doing?

O'NEIL

We'll release all intelligence at
the appropriate time.

DANIEL
And who's going to make that decision?
The Pentagon?

O'NEIL
Military intelligence.

DANIEL
That's a contradiction in terms.

Ignoring Daniel, O'Neil walks on.

 

DANIEL (CONT'D)
How do you think you'll be able to
keep this quiet! The public will
want to know.

O'Neil stops, faces Daniel.

O'NEIL
Who's going to tell them? You?
DANIEL
If I have to.
O'NEIL
(contemptuous)

Go ahead. Who do you think is going
to believe you? You're a joke.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)

You have no credibility left out
there. Face it, your only interest
here is to try and repair your damaged
reputation.

DANIEL
You're damned right I do. I've spent
the better part of my life studying
exactly what this project is all
about. I've dedicated myself to it.
What have you dedicated your life
to, Colonel?

The Colonel stares at him hard. He'd like to answer but
won't.

O'NEIL
(cold; lethal)
Pack your bags and get off this base.

O'Neil turns and walks away. Frustrated, Daniel yells after
him.

DANIEL
You're going to need me!

GENERAL WEST (0.S.)
He may be right.

O'Neil and Daniel spin to see General West standing behind
them.

CUT TO:
A HAND 69

Pushes one of the recording disks from the probe into some
kind of laser disk-type player.

The monitor lights up and through the static-filled video we
see the interior of some architectural STRUCTURE.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - LATER - DAY 71
Daniel stands in front of the large wall sized monitor at

the edge of the room. Behind are the military officials,
Kawalsky and O'Neil.

The image slowly rotates, panning around the room stone walls.
Soon we pass over another STAR GATE, fully powered.
33.

GENERAL WEST
Freeze and enhance.

The image FREEZES. Digitally the image is ENHANCED as we
artificially ZOOM closer, detailing the ring of the Star
Gate.

Fascinated, Daniel moves closer.

DANIEL
The markings... they're different.

GENERAL WEST
That's why I wanted you to see this.

ASSISTANT LIEUTENANT
The readouts tell us it's an
atmospheric match. Barometric
pressure, temperature and most
importantly oxygen. All compatible
to Earth. As we expected.

The General steps behind Daniel.

GENERAL WEST
But I won't send our boys over there
if I'm not absolutely sure I can
bring 'em back.

ASSISTANT LIEUTENANT
We know the beam will only stay
connected for a short amount of time.
After the ring shuts itself down,
we'll have to re-establish the beam
from the other side.

DANIEL
We could re-establish from here.

GENERAL WEST
Once our team goes through, this
place will be evacuated and sealed.
We don't know what might come through
from the other side.

DANIEL
So you want me to go over with the
team, re-align the Star Gate and
bring everyone back home.

GENERAL WEST
Question is, can you do it?

Daniel takes a beat, turns to O'Neil and Kawalsky who stand
near the back of the room.
72

73

74

34.

DANIEL
Yes... I can do it.

GENERAL WEST
Are you sure?

DANIEL
Positive.

General West turns to his counterparts who all nod in
agreement.

GENERAL WEST
Fine. You're on the team.

Dismissed, Kawalsky escorts Daniel out of the room. Once
they're both gone, O'Neil turns back to General West.

O'NEIL
He's smart. He won't go along with
us if he figures it out.
GENERAL WEST
Then it's your job to make sure he
doesn't.

She opens her hand, exposing the SUN DISK necklace.

Lifting the necklace, Catherine puts it on a grateful Daniel.

CATHERINE
Bring it back to me.

Overcome with emotion, Catherine turns away and hurries out.
Daniel watches her leave.

O'Neil marches towards the anxious and concerned faces of
our away squad; Kawalsky, five SOLDIERS (We recognize these
soldiers from Daniel's arrival) and Daniel.
There's a long tense pause. Finally...
O'NEIL

Does anyone want to say anything

before we go?
O'Neil walks past each member of the squad who look up at
him and say nothing. SNEEZE. Everyone turns down the line
looking at Daniel who wipes his nose with a Kleenex.

...we then enter a gigantic black space, floating... until a
sun-like light RUSHES towards us, engulfing us... ...the

In a pool of light beneath the Star Gate on the other side

cold. Hands reach out for him. Panicked, Daniel knocks

them away.

KAWALSKY
Jackson, you alright?

O'NEIL
Calm down, Jackson, it's over.

Squinting through the bright light, Daniel can just make out
the shapes of the other members of the squad, scattered around
the room in various states of recovery.

Coughing, squinting and shaking off the cold, the team comes
together.

Suddenly the Star Gate begins to TURN on its own. As it
STOPS the light at the ring's center SHUTS OFF. TOTAL
BLACKNESS.

A FLARE ignites. Adjusting to the new light we SEE O'Neil
holding the flare, checking his men.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Everyone alright?

Slowly the squad nods. One soldier, LT. FERETTI, shakes it
off.

LT. FERETTI
Tell me we don't have to go through
that thing again.

Daniel, slowly recovering, lifts himself up, dazed. A second
flare is LIT. Using the light, Daniel scans the room,
spotting the Star Gate. He's amazed.

As he looks around we SEE that we are in a massive stone
surrounding, not nearly as big as the silo, yet still
impressive. Behind Daniel the squad gathers equipment,
readies to move out.

One soldier, FREEMAN, attaches a light to a harness mounted
VIDEO CAMERA, while BROWN slips on a back pack connected to

a receiving DISH for collecting technical data. Brown checks
a readout monitor attached to the back of his arm.

O'Neil moves over to a doorway leading to a short hallway.
He looks down the hallway and turns back to the squad.

Kawalsky nods as O'Neil moves through followed by another
soldier. Freeman adjusts his camera harness and follows.
Kawalsky moves to follow, then turns back to Daniel.

KAWALSKY

Daniel spins, nods and follows.
INT. HALLWAYS/MEDALLION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 94
Slowly the squad makes its way through the dark hallway and
across this small room. Brown checks his readout on the
move.
O'Neil and his team move quickly through, followed by Daniel
who stops, noticing something. He reaches forward and grabs
Freeman, turning his light down to the floor.
DANIEL'S P.O.V. - MEDALLION 95
We see a large round MEDALLION on the floor. Tilting
Freeman's light we look up to find a similar object on the
ceiling above.

Daniel doesn't know what to make of it. Annoyed, Freeman
shakes himself loose from Daniel and moves on.

BLACKNESS - HALLWAY 96
Two small blue-ish flares ROLL towards us, landing to a bumpy
stop. Together they illuminate this GRAND GALLERY (a larger
hallway leading upwards). Below us we see Feretti's face as

he peers upwards.

He tosses another flare and enters with his team.

Silhouetted at the end of the hall, in the next room. Brown
turns his back to us.

BROWN
(off his readout)
Conditions are similar to inside.
Radiation, electromagnetic and other
exposures, normal.

The rest of the team moves onward.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS 103
Cautiously the team makes its way through this huge room,
rotating positions, moving pillar at a time. Again, Brown

and Feretti are the first to reach the doorway leading

outside.

Checking his readings, Brown turns back and gives the okay
sign. The team follow.

ANGLE - DANIEL 104

Totally awestruck, Daniel cannot believe what he's seeing.
He's thrilled. Nearly in a daze, Daniel takes it all in.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - EXITING ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 105

Following closely behind O'Neil, Daniel slowly makes his way
through the doorway out into the bright sunlight. Daniel
finds himself on a large platform surrounded by SAND DUNES.

Ahead of him he SEES the soldiers who've taken defensive
positions across the platform and Brown and Freeman who are
amazed as they record all they survey.

EXT. ENTRANCE PLATFORM - DAY 106

We see the entire team positioned across this mammoth
structure. O'Neil turns to Kawalsky and Feretti.

O'NEIL
I want to see where the hell I am.
Kawalsky, Feretti, secure the base
of this ramp. I'm going to take a
look around.

DANIEL
I'll go with you.

O'Neil ignores Daniel as he follows Kawalsky and Feretti
down the long ramp into the sands.

ANGLE - ENTRANCE RAMP 107

At the base of the ramp stand two LARGE OBELISKS. Kawalsky
and Feretti take positions on either side of the OBELISKS.
O'Neil and Daniel follow down the ramp and into the sand.

Behind them, Freeman marches down with his camera. As he
nears the base of the ramp he LIFTS his camera to get a better
look at the structure they've just left. Slowly he moves

away from his eyepiece.

FREEMAN
Holy shit!

ANGLE - DANIEL AND O'NEIL 108

climb the dune across from the obelisks. Winded, Daniel
reaches the top long after O'Neil.

As Daniel catches his breath he turns to see what O'Neil is
looking at. Daniel is stunned, speechless.

DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - THE PYRAMID 109

Just like the great one of Egypt, only BIGGER and without
any decay. Glorious and breathtaking.

Looming just beyond the pyramid we see THREE SUNS in the sky
bearing down on us. Thrilled, exhilarated and frightened,
O'Neil and Daniel stand there in total awe. Too overwhelmed
to speak. Finally...

DANIEL
(thrilled)
I knew it!

O'Neil shoots him a look and heads back down the dune.
Overjoyed, Daniel just stares at the horizon, filled with
wonder. Halfway down, O'Neil turns back to him.
110

42.

O'NEIL
Jackson, what are you waiting for?

Daniel turns and follows.
ANGLE - OBELISKS 110

Kawalsky and Feretti move over to meet O'Neil as he walks
over from the dune. Freeman continues to video everything.

O'NEIL
I want two men securing the hallways
leading to the star gate, two men
guarding the entrance of the
structure. Freeman, you and Brown
sweep the exterior surroundings...

FREEMAN
Yes, sir.

Daniel rushes up from behind.

O'NEIL
...and you, get to work. I want us
re-establishing contact within the
hour.

DANIEL
I need more time. There's bound to
be more structures here, traces of
Civilization...

O'NEIL
What are you trying to say?

DANIEL
Look at it! It's an exact replica
of the great pyramid of Giza. We're
not going to find any hieroglyphic
or pictorial displays. We've got to
expand our search... Kawalsky and
Feretti exchange a glance. O'Neil
steps close to Daniel.

O'NEIL
Your job is to re-align the star
gate and get us back home. Can you
do it or not?

There's a long pause as Daniel decides to answer.

DANIEL
I can't.

O'NEIL
Can't or won't?
43.
Feretti leans close to Kawalsky who stares at Daniel, pissed.

FERETTI
What's he talking about?

DANIEL
If they marked the co-ordinates on
tablets back on Earth, there must be
something like that here. I just
have to find it.

KAWALSKY

Find it!? That wasn't the deal!
O'NEIL

Lieutenant.
FERETTI

So we're stuck here. Great.

KAWALSKY
You lying son of a bitch.

Kawalsky SHOVES Daniel, hard.

O'NEIL
Lieutenant!

Kawalsky freezes. There is a long tense moment as Kawalsky
finally eases off.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
We'll set up base camp down here.
Organize our supplies.

KAWALSKY
But Colonel...

O'NEIL
You have your orders.

Reluctantly Kawalsky turns and leaves, Feretti in tow. Daniel
stands up behind O'Neil who turns back to him. O'Neil turns
and looks at Daniel, cold. After a pregnant beat, O'Neil
turns and walks away.

CUT TO:
111 A HAMMER 111
Slams down against a large tent SPIKE.
112 EXT. BASE CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON. 112

A shirtless Feretti ties down the cover tent; a larger tent
shading several smaller tents beneath. Sweating under the
intense heat, Brown and Freeman unpack some equipment.
113

44.

FREEMAN
If we don't return soon, they'll
just turn it back on from the other
side, won't they?

BROWN
Who will? They sealed the silo!
Don't you get it? There's no one

there.

FERETTI
I'm telling you guys, we're stuck
here!

Pissed, Feretti takes out his frustration on another tent
post, SLAM.

EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 113

At the base of the ramp, Daniel struggles carrying a heavy
box. Another Soldier BUMPS into him as he passes, easily
carrying his own load.

DANIEL
No problem, I got it.

Contemptuous, the other soldier doesn't even look back.
Daniel begins the long climb up the dune.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 114

Kawalsky walks over to the wheeled vehicle to pick up the
last two crates from its cargo area.

KAWALSKY
Base camp is set up, Sir.

O'NEIL
I've got that one.

Kawalsky nods. He puts back down one of the crates and leaves
with the other. Once gone, O'Neil moves over to the wheeled
vehicle, lifting off the last crate. He reaches into his
pocket and produces a strange looking TOOL.

KAWALSKY (0.S.)
Sir, permission to speak?

O'Neil coolly palms the tool, hiding it and turns around.

O'NEIL
Granted.

KAWALSKY
I just wanted to apologize for losing
my cool. It's just... this is all
so... overwhelming.
115

45.

O'NEIL
Don't let it happen again.

O'Neil turns away. Hurt, Kawalsky would like to say more,
doesn't. He leaves. O'Neil takes the tool, placing it into
the floor boards of the vehicle.

As he maneuvers the tool, a section of the floor COMES OFF,
revealing a hidden compartment below. O'Neil reaches in and
removes two heavy, SOPHISTICATED LOOKING DEVICES.
Placing the Devices on the floor, he adjusts something on
them, connecting the two pieces together. Joined, he opens
a common LID, exposing a small button.
As he presses it, a square electrical "KEY" POPS UP.
O'Neil pockets the "KEY" and shuts the lid, locking it.
CUT TO:
BASE CAMP 115

Daniel struggles up the last few steps of the hill. He DROPS
his cargo down, with a THUD. Exhausted, he sits.

DANIEL
Anyone have some sun block... say
100?

The others turn away, ignoring his joke.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
What's in all these boxes, anyway?

Daniel opens the box he carried, revealing DOZENS OF GUNS.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(sarcastic)

Jesus. You guys plan on fighting a

war here?

Feretti shoots him a dirty look.

FERETTI
Don't you have something you should
be doing?

Feretti lifts a large duffel and HEAVES it at Daniel, knocking
him over. The duffel rolls from his hands and all his BOOKS
go TUMBLING DOWN the other side of the dune.

Feretti smiles to Brown as Daniel reluctantly gets up and
climbs down the dune after his belongings.

LOWER DUNE - CONTINUOUS 116
Daniel makes his way clumsily down the sand, his books are
scattered everywhere. As he reaches over to pick up the
empty duffel, he SEES...
HOOF PRINTS
in the sand. Deep set prints, walking around the next dune.
Daniel can't believe it. For a moment he considers going
back and telling the others, thinks better of it and follows
the tracks.
NEXT DUNE 117

As Daniel climbs to the top of the next dune he SEES the
tracks continuing over the next sand dune. Daniel follows.

BASE CAMP - SAME 118

O'Neil arrives carrying the last crate. He looks around,
turns to Feretti.

O'NEIL
Where's Jackson?

The Soldiers exchange a glance.
FERETTI
He dropped his stuff. I think he
went to pick it up.

Feretti points in the direction Daniel went. O'Neil signals
Brown and Kawalsky to follow him.

LOWER DUNE - CONTINUOUS 119
O'Neil finds the books and bag scattered down the sand.

Across from it several tracks, the beasts' and Daniel's.

O'Neil shoots a look over to his men.

SAND DUNES - SAME 120

As Daniel reaches the top of the next dune he sees something.
He crouches low, not to be seen.

DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - MASTADGE 121
Climbing beyond the next dune we SEE a large hairy BEAST. A
strange cross between a Mammoth and a Buffalo, (called a
MASTADGE). Daniel is awestruck.

Slowly and cautiously, Daniel starts to make his way towards
it.

Halfway down, however, the Mastadge TURNS, spotting Daniel.
Daniel FREEZES in his tracks. So does the Mastadge.
122

47.

After a long beat where no one moves, Daniel takes a step
forward. The Mastadge takes a step back. Daniel freezes.
The Mastadge takes a step forward but this time a nervous
Daniel takes a step back. Both freeze.

Daniel notices something on the head and neck of the Mastadge;
A HARNESS. He reaches into his picket and pulls out a
SNICKERS BAR. He peels it and shows it to the Mastadge.

DANIEL
Hungry?

With its great nostrils, the Mastadge SNIFFS the air. Daniel
inches closer as the Mastadge lowers its head. Slowly the
Mastadge moves closer to Daniel, cautious. Carefully, Daniel
lifts the bar, closer to the animal's mouth. We RACK FOCUS
TO:

ANGLE - O'NEIL, BROWN AND KAWALSKY 122

As they come over the top of the next dune, spotting Daniel.
Kawalsky and Brown lift their weapons.

O'NEIL
Don't feed it!

Daniel turns, sees O'Neil, but ignores him. The Mastadge
sticks out its MASSIVE TONGUE and LICKS the Snickers Bar.
Daniel, nervous, drops the bar. The Mastadge leans down and
picks it up with its teeth.

Daniel smiles and moves closer to it. He reaches out and
PETS the Mastadge. It makes a kind of PURRING SOUND as it
eats. It's cute as hell. It nuzzles Daniel.

Daniel turns to O'Neil, yells over to him.

DANIEL
Look, it's got a harness. It's
domesticated. See?

Daniel lifts one of the reins attached to the harness and
shows it to O'Neil. O'Neil nods apprehensively, signals his
men to lower their rifles.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You're a good old boy, aren't you.

The beast seems to respond. Daniel smiles as he runs his
hand over the Mastadge's head. But when Daniel's hand touches
the beasts EARS, it REARS UP, ROARING.

The Mastadge JUMPS UP onto its back legs. His reins get
caught around Daniel's leg. Screaming the Mastadge KICKS
and TAKES OFF RUNNING! Daniel gets DRAGGED OFF along with
the beast.

O'Neil and the Lieutenants lift their weapons but the animal
is too FAST. They watch as Daniel gets DRAGGED up and over
the next sand dune DISAPPEARING from sight.

KAWALSKY
(yelling after Daniel)
Let go of it!

Frustrated, they lower their guns and take off after them.
ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE

Daniel is DRAGGED, screaming as he's pulled. Twisting and
bumping. His mouth filling with sand.

ANGLE - O'NEIL, KAWALSKY, AND BROWN.

Huffing and puffing as they climb the top of the next dune.
Getting Daniel back in sight, they SEE how fast the Mastadge
is.

WIDE SHOT - DESERT

Daniel is PULLED AWAY farther and farther from O'Neil who
chases from behind. No match for the speeding beast, the
distance between them grows.

DANIEL AND MASTADGE

Off into the distance, Daniel gets dragged over a sand dune,
out of sight.

O'NEIL, BROWN AND KAWALSKY

Come running over a dune, guns raised. Suddenly they slow
down as they SEE Daniel, laying in a heap, the Mastadge
standing over him. The team keep their weapons trained on
the beast as they approach from a distance.

ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE

Daniel spits out a mouthful of sand as the Mastadge leans
over and begins to LICK HIS FACE.

DANIEL
Argh! Get your stinking breath away
from me!
(yelling back to O'Neil)
Somebody help me!

Finally O'Neil and his men arrive, but to Daniel's surprise
they PASS right by him, lowering their guns.

KAWALSKY
(out of breath)
Holy Jesus.

Daniel looks up, spits out the sand in his mouth. He stands
up and joins the others at a nearby ledge.

He finally sees what they see...
DANIEL P.O.V. - TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 129

Thousands of dark skinned PEOPLE populating the dune valleys
below. Humans, like on Earth, seemingly out of place and
time.

At the base of the huge dunes we see gigantic MINING PITS;
dark cavities in the sand. Dozens of ladders protrude out
of the dark pits up the sides of the dunes.

Covered with thick MUD, their faces barely recognizable as
human, dozens of WORKERS climb the ladders carrying heavy
loads on their backs.

At the top of the sand craters we see women and younger
workers, sifting through the piles of dirt carried out of
the pit. Mastadges harnessed to huge carts, to carry the
worker's cargo.

ANGLE - DANIEL AND THE OTHERS 130

The brutal humanity of this work is a terrifying sight.
Amazed, they can't believe what they're seeing. O'Neil lifts
a pair of binoculars, scanning the area.

O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - MINING AREA 130A

Spread across the sands, we SEE these people carrying out
back breaking labor. Suddenly a worker in the foreground
turns and looks DIRECTLY AT US.

O'Neil lowers his glasses just as he SEES... The workers all
start LOOKING UP, spotting them. The news SPREADS and more
and more workers put down their tools and turn to the
hillside. Several of the groups crowd closer, staring up at
the strange visitors.

Reacting, Kawalsky slowly lifts his rifle. O'Neil reaches
over, grabbing the barrel of the gun, stopping him. He
signals for the others to follow him down the dune.

GROUPS OF WORKERS 131

Gathering together, moving closer. As they assemble they
grow quiet, reverent.

The team cautiously makes their way down the sloping hillside
in the tense silence. Wind whistling through the hollow
pits. The Mastadge follows Daniel closely as they head down
the hill.
132

50.
WIDE SHOT - THOUSANDS OF WORKERS 132

All staring over at our crew as they arrive just a few yards
in front of the assembled crowd. Nervously the crew smiles
out at the workers who stare at them with a mixture of awe
and fear.

O'NEIL
(under his breath to
Daniel)
Okay, Daniel. It's your turn.

DANIEL
Me?

O'NEIL
Try and talk to them.

Daniel has no idea what to do. Slowly he walks over, a forced
smile for the crowd. He steps up close to a MUDDY WORKER.

DANIEL
(petrified)
Re... hello?

The Worker looks at him with curiosity. Suddenly a FLASH of
reflected LIGHT shines off of the Golden Sun Disk around
Daniel's neck. As the worker SEES this, his eyes widen.

Suddenly he SCREAMS something out, frightening our crew.
All at once, the entire assembly in a wave-like chain reaction
BOWS DOWN, FLAT ON THE FLOOR.

KAWALSKY
(whispered)
What did he say?

O'NEIL
I don't know.

They take a few steps closer to Daniel.
O'NEIL (CONT'D)
What the hell did you tell them,
Jackson?
DANIEL turns back to O'Neil, nervous and confused.

DANIEL
Nothing.

O'NEIL
Try to communicate.

DANIEL
How?
133

51.

Frustrated O'Neil steps forward. He singles out one of the
workers, a young boy, SKAARA, sixteen. Filled with fear,
Skaara averts his eyes.

O'Neil extends his hand. Skaara only looks at it with
mounting fright. Frustrated, O'Neil GRABS Skaara's hand,
shaking it.

Skaara SCREAMS OUT in fear and takes off RUNNING. He runs
as fast as he can until he disappears from view. O'Neil
turns to Daniel, confused.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
So much for communication.

O'Neil shoots him a look.

Behind them, Brown leans over one of the piles of minerals
stacked nearby. He lowers a device over it, taking readings.

Kawalsky's attention is diverted to something far away.
Noticing Kawalsky looking away, Daniel and O'Neil turn to
SEE...

DECORATED MASTADGE AND ENTOURAGE 133

An elaborately decorated Mastadge with a covered carriage on
its back comes marching over through the gathered workers, a
small entourage surrounding it as it moves. Among them,
Skaara, who looks up to the carriage, speaking quickly.

Slowly it makes its way through the crowd over to Daniel and
the others. It stops and an elderly man, KASUF, the tribe
priest steps from the carriage.

As he gets to the front of the crowd he KNEELS before Daniel.
Kasuf begins to SPEAK in his language. His head bowed, Kasuf
speaks very FAST and with reverence.

Finally, when done, Kasuf STANDS again. This time the ENTIRE
CROWD stands with him, as though a prayer had ended. Daniel
looks at O'Neil.

O'NEIL
Don't look at me.

Kasuf signals a group of WOMEN who approach carrying large
water basins. SARI, twenty, beautiful and painfully shy,
steps forward and offers some water to Daniel.

Her hair up in an Egyptian looking head covering looks like
the spitting image of Daniel's Egyptian bust. Daniel is
stunned, smitten. Slowly he accepts a drink. She humbly
bows her head and then moves on to Kawalsky. Kasuf steps
forward, again, speaking quickly. Asking a question.
52.

Captivated by Sari, it takes Daniel a second to snap out of
it. He doesn't know how to respond. An idea hits him and
he digs into his pocket and retrieves another Snickers Bar.
Daniel walks over to Kasuf, peeling the bar. He shows it to
Kasuf.

Kasuf looks at it. He doesn't understand. Daniel takes a
bite. In a ceremonial gesture, Daniel hands the bar over to
Kasuf who reluctantly takes it. Hesitantly, he takes a bite.
He likes the taste and smiles.

KASUF
Anaasar.

Daniel is thrilled. He smiles back at him.

DANIEL
Anaasar.

Pleased at communicating with Daniel, Kasuf waves his arms
invitingly towards the direction from which he came.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
He's inviting us to go with him.

KAWALSKY
What makes you so sure?

Daniel exaggeratedly repeats Kasuf's gesture.

DANIEL
Sign language.

Everyone turns to the Colonel for a decision. He makes none.
He just stares at the departing Kasuf, considering.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Weren't we looking for signs of
civilization? Obviously we've found
it. You want me to get us back home?
This is my best shot.

BROWN
Colonel, he's right. I took some
readings on what they're mining.
It's the same material as the Star
Gate.

Looking at the faces of the mud covered workers, O'Neil
finally makes a decision.

O'NEIL
Give me the radio.

CUT TO:

EXT. BASE CAMP - SAME 134

The wind has kicked up. Feretti and another soldier struggle
to re-tie the main tent to a post.

FREEMAN
(yelling over)
Feretti! I've got O'Neil on the
radio.

Feretti hurries over to Freeman.

FERETTI
(into Mic)
Yes, Sir...

Worried, the remaining members of the team huddle close.

FERETTI (CONT'D)
Can you repeat that Sir?
(long pause)
Okay, Sir. Yes, Sir.

He hangs up, a strange look on his face. He turns to the
men.

FREEMAN
Are they coming back?

Feretti is reluctant to answer. Finally...

FERETTI
This is not good. I'm telling you
guys, this is not good.

CUT TO:
EXT. DESERT - WIDE SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON 135

Over the boundless sea of sand dunes we PAN DOWN an endless
caravan of workers making their way across the desert. Kasuf
leads the procession, our crew in tow.

ANGLE - DANIEL AND MASTADGE 136

Daniel BLOWS his nose into a Kleenex, drawing strange looks
from the workers. Daniel's attention, however, is on the
beautiful Sari who walks across from him.

Suddenly the Mastadge BUMPS Daniel playfully from behind.
Daniel ignore it as he continues to gaze at Sari. The
Mastadge does it again. Skaara, who holds the reins of the
Mastadge, giggles at Daniel's plight.

DANIEL
(to Mastadge)
Cut it out.
137

138

139

140

54.

Scolded, the Mastadge NUZZLES the back of Daniel's neck trying
to make up. Daniel takes out the remainder of his last
Snickers Bar and feeds it to the Mastadge who happily chews
it.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Here. Now stop bugging me.

O'NEIL
(turning back)
I told you not to feed it. Now you'll
never get rid of that stupid thing.

Again, the Mastadge playfully BUMPS Daniel from behind.

KAWALSKY
(to Brown)
At least somebody likes him.

Suddenly the convoy STOPS. Ahead, Kasuf stops and turns
back towards Daniel, pointing off into the distance. As
Daniel walks closer he can see...

DANIEL'S TRAVELLING P.O.V. - NAGADA - SUNSET

The ancient village of the people of this planet set snugly
at the base of a rocky hillside. A huge settlement. People
milling around the gates surrounding it.

EXT. NAGADA VALLEY - MINUTES LATER - SUNSET

The long caravan makes its way down into this valley. The
town's people rush over to get a look at the strange guests
of Kasuf.

ANGLE - KASUF

At the front of the convoy, Daniel and the team walk along
with Kasuf. The Mastadge still following behind.

Suddenly Skaara, pulls the Mastadge away joining several
other young SHEPHERD BOYS who corral the Mastadges. The
Mastadge WHINES a cry of protest as he gets pulled away from
Daniel.

INT. NAGADA VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

Passing through the enormous gates to the village, Daniel
and the team are amazed at what they see. Hundreds of people
cram into these narrow streets to get a look at the visitors.

As they reach the end of the street, they reach an elevated
PLATFORM. Kasuf gives a signal and a curtain falls,
revealing...

137

138

139

140
141

142

143

144

55.
GOLDEN SUN DISK 141

This Gold SUN DISK, two meters in diameter, hangs above the
platform. Daniel is totally astonished.

DANIEL
The sign of Ra, the Egyptian Sun
God.
(to O'Neil)

They worship him. They must think
he sent us here.

O'NEIL
What gave them that idea?

Slowly Daniel lifts the Sun Disk hanging from his neck. As
he does, all the workers surrounding them bow down. Even
Kasuf kneels. O'Neil and his men exchange a worried look.

Daniel stares up at the SUN DISK. We DISSOLVE to the image
of the planet's three SETTING SUNS, disappearing behind the
dunes.

DISSOLVE TO:
BURST OF FLAME 142

ignites in a FIREBALL. The SOUNDS of CHEERS followed by
percussion instruments, primitive music.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:
EXT. VILLAGE - STREET - NIGHT 143

A group of women carrying trays of food pass. As we TRACK
with them we SEE the entire town has come out for a
CELEBRATION. We FOLLOW the women through the crowds over to
the platform where Daniel and the team sit with the town
Elders.

As the food arrives we SEE Sari, among the women, serving
the people on the platform.

KAWALSKY
(whispering)
I don't think we should be eating
anything.

DANIEL
They might consider that an insult.

Just then a TRAY is lowered before Daniel.
A DESERT REPTILE 144

A cooked beastie even Ethiopians wouldn't eat. Daniel looks
like he's going to be sick.
145

56.

O'NEIL
You don't want to offend them, now
do you, Jackson?

Daniel looks at O'Neil, worried. In fact, no one on the
team wants to eat. They all exchange nervous glances. Kasuf
and the Elders turn, waiting for them to start.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Go on, eat.

Reluctantly Daniel leans over and takes a fleshy piece of
slimy meat. He takes a deep breath, shuts his eyes, and
eats it. Everyone stares at him. Finally after a long pause...

DANIEL
(chewing)
Tastes like chicken.

SARI 145

kneels down next to Daniel, offering him some bread. For

the first time he sees her with her hair down, looking all
the more lovely. He just stares at her for a long awkward
beat. Sari won't look directly at him. Daniel is completely
enamored.

O'NEIL
Jackson.

Daniel just smiles stupidly at Sari. The Elders and Kasuf
turn, noticing the interaction. They discuss it with
interest.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Jackson.

Nervous and embarrassed, Sari hands him the bowl and retreats.
The spell broken, Daniel turns back to O'Neil.

DANIEL
(absently)
Yeah?

O'NEIL
(impatient)
Do you think you can keep your mind
on what we're here for?

DANIEL
Oh, I can't make it out. Their
language sounds familiar, a bit like
Berber, or maybe Chadic, or Omotic?
I can't tell.
146

147

57.

O'NEIL
(re: above disk)
You said that was an Egyptian symbol.

DANIEL
Yes.

O'NEIL
Stands to reason, if they know one
Egyptian symbol...

DANIEL
...they'1ll know more. Let me try.

Daniel stands, walks before the town Elders. With everyone's
attention locked on Daniel, he kneels down in front of the
Elders and begins to draw in the sand.

The Elders lean forward to get a look. Daniel shows them a
quickly drawn hieroglyphic symbol. Instantly the Elders
REACT, turning to each other, speaking quickly, obviously
upset.

Worried he's done the wrong thing. Daniel tries writing
something else. The moment the drawing can be seen, the
Elders instantly RETREAT, backing down off the platform,
averting your eyes.

The crowd begins to MURMUR. The Elders clearly distraught.
As Daniel tries to write something completely different,
Kasuf rushes over and WIPES OUT the drawings in the sand.

O'NEIL
What's happening here, Jackson?

DANIEL
I don't know. Look how they're
reacting. It's like...
(turning back)
...writing is forbidden to them.

Realizing their hope of finding the clue to the gate is gone,
the team grows silent in despair. Suddenly through the
restless sounds of the crowd we HEAR the echoing SOUND of a
HORN. Daniel looks up to SEE...

A LOOKOUT 146
Up top of the village a young LOOKOUT, lifts a small HORN,

and again sounds an ALARM that reverberates through the

streets.

ANGLE - STREET 147
Reacting to the SOUND, the people quickly begin to gather

belongings and disperse. Tables and cushions are DRAGGED
AWAY. A cloth is DROPPED over the SUN DISK, covering it.
148

58.
Doors are LOCKED, windows SHUT.

Kawalsky and Brown rush to O'Neil and Daniel, nervous.

KAWALSKY
What are they doing?

BROWN
Colonel, I don't like the looks of
this... Before Brown can finish his

thought, we SEE the two huge entrance
doors at the end of the street begin
TO CLOSE.

O'NEIL
We're getting out of here.

Quickly O'Neil leads the team through the crowds, down the
streets.

DANIEL
Why? Wait...!

Ignored, the team continues without him. Daniel rushes to
catch up. As the team moves down the street people REACH
OUT, trying to STOP THEM. Knocked aside, the soldiers push
onward.

ANGLE - FRONT ENTRANCE DOORS 148

Just as they SHUT. Two YOUNG MEN rush over and LOCK it down
with a crossbar. O'Neil moves quickly to the door, Kawalsky
and Brown behind.

O'NEIL
Open that door!

O'Neil REACHES for the crossbar. One of the Young Men GRABS
his wrist. In lightning speed, O'Neil TWISTS the Young Man's
arm behind his back and SLAMS him into the door.

Quickly O'Neil DRAWS his pistol, shoving it into the side of
the Young Man's head. He SCREAMS OUT, but of course we can't
understand him.

DANIEL
No, don't!

Kasuf and the Elders push through the crowd. Sari watches
from the side, apprehensive. Skaara and the shepherd boys,
across from her, are glued to the action, peering through
the mob.

As the crowd moves closer, O'Neil aims his pistol high and
FIRES. Kawalsky and Brown lift their weapons, ready for a
Fight. The crowd quickly retreats. Skaara is AMAZED.

The crowd remains silent, frightened they've upset the Gods.
O'Neil holds the Young Man tight. A standoff.

Suddenly Brown's radio SQUELCHES ON. Brown lifts it to his
ear, listening.

BROWN
Sir, I can't make this out.

EXT. BASE CAMP - SAND STORM - NIGHT 149

A huge SAND STORM blasts around the men who try to pack what
they can as they retreat from base camp. Feretti holds the
radio, yelling into it on the move. The tents tear apart
behind them.

FERETTI
...we have to abandon base camp. I
repeat... Feretti ushers his men

onward as he fights his way through.
EXT. NAGADA - ENTRANCE DOOR - SAME 150

O'Neil presses the radio close to his ear. Only every third
word is heard through the intense static.

O'NEIL
(yelling into com)
Feretti, I can't hear you. Say again?

INT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME 151

Through a wall of white sand, shapes appear, rushing towards
us. As we DOLLY BACK, we SEE that the team has reached the
safety of the pyramid entrance. They collapse from
exhaustion.

FERETTI
(into radio)
Do you copy? Do you copy?

But only loud STATIC can be heard. Feretti turns to the
nervous faces of the other soldiers.

EXT. NAGADA - ENTRANCE DOOR - SAME 152
Frustrated, O'Neil gives up, shuts the radio off.

O'NEIL
Damn it.

The crowd still stares intently. Kawalsky and Brown hold
their guns at the ready. Suddenly O'Neil feels a TUG at his
shirt; Skaara, the young shepherd boy.

O'Neil SPINS towards him. Skaara backs off quickly. Moving
over to a ladder, he motions for O'Neil to follow him.
153

O'Neil looks over to Daniel who can only shrug.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
(to Kawalsky)
Stay here.

O'Neil follows Skaara.
ANGLE - TOP OF THE NAGADA GATE - CONTINUOUS 153

Skaara reaches the top and moves to the side. O'Neil follows.
His face registers an important sight.

O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - SAND STORM 154
Moving quickly we SEE a WALL OF SAND moving towards the town.

KAWALSKY
Sir, what is it?

O'NEIL
Sand storm. Coming this way.

DANIEL
Well, that would have been an
excellent reason to shoot everyone.

Daniel moves over to the two soldiers, forcing them to lower
their guns. Daniel turns back to Kasuf, attempting to signal
the tension is over. Kasuf nods and calls out to the back

of the crowd.

O'NEIL
(yelling down)
We'll stay 'til the storm is over.

Brown and Kawalsky exchange a look. A commotion behind them,
they turn to SEE a group of ELDERLY WOMEN push their way
through the crowd over to Daniel, surrounding him placing a
shawl over his shoulders. They giggle as they slowly pulla
surprised Daniel down the street.

The crowd laughs as they depart, moving to shelter. The
only one not laughing is Sari who watches Daniel pass. Daniel
yells back to O'Neil.

DANIEL
Should I go with them? I could
stay... I'll go. It'll be fine.

The women begin to toss strange POWDER over Daniel's head as
they enter a building down the street. Kawalsky leans close
to Brown.

KAWALSKY
I hope they cook him.

EXT. PYRAMID SAND STORM NIGHT 155

The sand storm has hit full force. We can barely make out
the entrance to the pyramid through the murky sky.

INT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME - NIGHT 156

Feretti shields his eyes as he stands in the doorway looking
out at the storm. The image of the moon scarcely pierces
through the whirling sand. Feretti turns and walks back
into the main entrance hall.

MOON ABOVE PYRAMID - SAME - NIGHT 157

Just as we saw in the opening, a SHADOW is cast across the
moon, blotting it out. Something moves in the sky above the
storm.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME - NIGHT 158

Feretti walks over to the group of soldiers who surround the
radio.

FERETTI
(into radio)
This is base. Do you read?

FREEMAN
You're wasting the batteries.

Feretti shuts off the radio and places his helmet over it.

FREEMAN (CONT'D)

We're not going to get anything during
this storm. We'll try again after

it passes.

FERETTI
If it passes. I was stationed in
the Middle East and I've never seen
anything like it. I'm telling you
guys, this is not good.

There is a silent moment. Suddenly they all hear the SOUND

of RATTLING METAL. They turn and SEE Feretti's helmet SHAKING
against the radio. Slowly Freeman removes the helmet, the
radio jostling underneath. Suddenly the FLARE BOXES begin

to SHAKE. Soon, all their equipment begins to RATTLE.

Suddenly the ENTIRE ROOM begins to rumble. An eerie,

unnatural HUM begins to grow in volume. The men exchange

worried glances.

EXT. PYRAMID - SAME - NIGHT 159

Above the intense storm a SHAPE begins to take FORM, looming
above us. The ROAR intensifying.

The SHAPE begins to pierce through the turbulence. We can
SEE it's some kind of alien OBJECT. BRIGHT LIGHTS darting
off its sides as it grows near.
As the cloudy sand is BLOWN away, we can clearly see it's a
pyramid shaped SPACE CRAFT. Landing ARMS extending as it
LOWERS itself down over the TOP OF THE PYRAMID.
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 160
The room is now SHAKING violently. Frightened, the men grab
their weapons. They have no idea what's happening. Quickly
they group together.
EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 161

The ARMS of the craft LOCK into place as the craft FITS itself
onto the peak of the pyramid.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 162
From the IMPACT, the Soldiers are KNOCKED off their feet.
EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 163

Once in place, the craft begins to OPEN, UNFOLDING and
exposing the technical details of the craft.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - MEDALLION ROOM - SAME - NIGHT 164
With the Star Gate seen in the background, we can SEE a thin
LASER tracing the outline of the MEDALLION on the floor.
Something is happening, igniting.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 165

Their guns pointed in every direction, the men are huddled
together, ready for a fight.

FREEMAN
(yelling over roar)
What the hell is happening?

INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME 165A
In the center of the room we SEE a large SARCOPHAGUS, its

side slowly LOWERING, revealing the figure of a MAN who lays
inside.

TRAVELING P.O.V. - SHAKING - SAME 166
Moving swiftly down the dark corridors of the interior of

the pyramid, we MOVE towards the unsuspecting Soldiers ahead

of us.

As we NEAR, one of the Soldiers SPOTS US, lifting his weapon.
Quickly the others SPIN, taking aim at us.
167

But we keep coming at them. At the same time they FIRE, but
NOTHING CAN STOP US. We move directly into Freeman's
SCREAMING FACE. Suddenly we FLASH CUT onto...
ANUBIS - EXTREME CLOSE UP 167

A Jackal headed creature, in our face.

CUT TO:
EXT. NAGADA - NIGHT 168
The sand storm continues to surround the village.
INT. DANIEL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME - NIGHT 169

Seated on a stool in the middle of the room, Daniel is beset
by the Elderly town's women who fuss over him with wash cloths
and combs. Completely uncomfortable, Daniel tries to be
polite and endure as much as he can.

But when the women begin to wash his ears and nose, Daniel
shakes them off.

DANIEL
Okay, okay. Thank you. That's
enough. Alright.

The Elderly women retreat, bowing and giggling as they exit
his room. Finally gone, Daniel breathes a sigh of relief.
Suddenly he HEARS some WHISPERING. He turns back towards
the doorway.

ANGLE DOORWAY - CURTAINS 170

The curtains rustle, then part. Sari steps through dressed
in a CEREMONIAL ROBE. She walks into the chamber towards
Daniel.

Nervous, Daniel gets to his feet, his heart in his throat.
As she makes her way closer to Daniel, she unties her robe
letting it FALL to the floor, revealing her beautiful NAKED
BODY. She stares at the floor, sadly.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
What..? Uh... no.

Daniel rushes over, picking up her robe.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Don't... that's not necessary.

He wraps the robe back around her, covering her. She doesn't
understand. She looks at him, scared she's displeased him.
171

172

64.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
It's not that I... I mean... you're
beautiful but... uh...

Realizing she can't understand, Daniel gently turns her back
towards the entrance, tenderly escorting her. At the curtain
he turns to her.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. You should go.

Her eyes fill with tears. Daniel opens the curtains for her
to leave, revealing...

THE TOWN'S ELDERS 171

All gathered just outside his chamber, crowding the bridge
between the buildings. Daniel stares out at the unexpected
ensemble. Kasuf looks over at Sari, sees her tears and speaks
angrily to her. Sari is frightened and in trouble. Daniel,
realizing this, suddenly SMILES and WAVES to the crowd.

DANIEL
Just wanted to say...
(for lack of better)
...thanks. Thank you very much.

Daniel waves and bows as he escorts Sari BACK into his
chamber. Quickly he SHUTS the curtains behind him. Now
Sari is totally confused. Again she starts to disrobe.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
No, no, that's okay.

Again, Daniel gently stops her, motioning for her to sit
down on the sleeping mat. She does. He crosses the room
and sits down a safe distance away.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Looks like you've got a roommate for
the night.

There is a long embarrassing pause as the two sit in awkward
silence.

CUT TO:
INT. O'NEIL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME 172

Brown and Kawalsky sit next to the radio. Brown readjusts
the dials. Kawalsky stares at O'Neil who stands at the window
on the other side of the room.

KAWALSKY
(whispered to Brown)
O'Neil seem strange to you?
(MORE )
173

174

65.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
The way he's taking all this. Like,
no big deal.

BROWN
Maybe he knows something we don't.

ANGLE - O'NEIL 173

O'Neil' stands by the window, watching the storm. Unseen,
Skaara enters through the doorway. Spotting O'Neill's
holstered pistol laying on the mattress, Skaara slowly creeps
towards the gun. Just as he reaches for it...

O'NEIL
No! Dangerous.

Somehow Skaara understands. Quickly he backs off. O'Neil
pulls out a pack of cigarettes, lights one. As the lighter
ignites, Skaara jumps to his feet, frightened.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
It's okay. It's just a lighter.

O'Neil tosses the lighter to Skaara. He lights it over and
over again. Skaara takes one of O'Neil's cigarettes out of
the pack on the bed, lights it, mimicking O'Neil.

O'Neil casts a sidelong glance at the boy. He sits down and
leans his head back against the wall. Skaara does the same
thing. Beat. O'Neil flicks the ash of his cigarette. Skaara
copies his every move.

Skaara and O'Neil sit there for a moment. Skaara's starting
to feel pretty confident by this point. O'Neil sees this.
He takes a deep drag off his cigarette and audibly INHALES,
deeply, exhaling a cloud of smoke.
Feeling cocky, Skaara imitates O'Neil. The minute the smoke
reaches his lungs, his eyes go wide, then fill with tears.
He starts COUGHING his guts up.
O'Neil suppresses a smile.
CUT TO:
INT. DANIEL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - SAME - NIGHT 174

Neither has moved. There's another awkward pause. Finally
Daniel smiles.

DANIEL
I'm Daniel... Daniel.

Sari points to herself, repeats Daniel.
175

66.

SARI
Dan-el.

DANIEL
No, er, me. Daniel.

Sari gets it, points to Daniel.

SARI
Dan-el.

DANIEL
Yes. Daniel.

There's a long pause. Slowly Sari points to herself.

SARI
Sari.

DANIEL
Sari, yes.

There is another awkward pause.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
We came from the pyramid.

She doesn't understand. Daniel kneels down and DRAWS a
pyramid in the sand covered floor. Again, Sari only stares
at it. Daniel grows frustrated and walks to the window.
Sari keeps staring at the drawing. She reaches over and
draws something over it.

Slowly Daniel turns back, curious to see Sari augmenting the
drawing.

He moves close to see she's drawn a circle and a line above
the pyramid; the same symbol Daniel discovered on the tablets.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
That's the sign for Earth! You know
this symbol?

She looks back up at him.
INT. MASTADGE CORRAL - SAME 175

With the Mastadges in the background, all the shepherd BOYS
are surrounding Skaara who holds O'Neil's lighter for everyone
to see, the wind from the storm continuing to HOWL outside.
Suddenly Skaara LIGHTS the lighter. The boys JUMP BACK in
fear.

Skaara laughs as the boys re-approach to examine the lighter.
Suddenly there is a BANGING SOUND. Skaara turns and sees
Daniel's Mastadge, banging his head against the corral door.

ANGLE - MASTADGE 176

As Skaara walks over and calms the Mastadge down he SEES
what the Mastadge was reacting to...

SKAARA'S P.O.V. - DANIEL AND SARI 177
Moving down the street, disappearing between the buildings.
EXT. NAGADA - SIDE STREET - SAME 178

A torch in her hand, Sari leads Daniel over to the end of a
small street at the side of the village.

Behind a stairwell, she shows Daniel a large boulder leaning
against the wall. She tries to PUSH IT. Daniel helps her
and together they move it away from the wall revealing a
small TUNNEL.

Sari checks to see if they've been observed. The coast clear,
Sari ducks inside. Daniel follows.

INT. SUBSTRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 179

They crawl beneath the structure through the dirt reaching a
hidden set of STAIRS leading downward. Sari points down the
stairs. Daniel takes the torch and walks down, Sari
following.

Eroded and musty walls surround the stairs. Daniel makes it
to the bottom of the stairs that lead directly to a dirt
covered WALL. The SYMBOL for Earth engraved in its center.

Astonished, Daniel runs his fingers around the surrounding
wall. His finger PUSHES THROUGH some dirt, until he's able
to dig out the archway surrounding the symbol; he uncovers a
DOOR.

Realizing it's a door, Daniel is able to dig into the door,
giving him something to grip. He PULLS with all his might.
Slowly the door OPENS.

Sari's eyes go wide. Daniel is nervous but excited.
Cautiously they make their way through the doorway.

INT. CATACOMBS - SAME 180

Behind the door we find the long narrow ancient catacombs,
obviously built centuries ago. Daniel holds his torch up to
the walls revealing...

HIEROGLYPHICS AND DRAWINGS 181

Covering every bit of wall space, all the way down this narrow
passage way. Daniel turns to Sari, stunned. Sari, too, has
never seen any of this. She's frightened. Daniel continues
down the wall, trying to make sense out of this picture story.
68.

182 DANIEL'S P.O.V. - PICTURE STORY 182

AS we move down the wall we see... the now familiar symbol
for Earth... then ANIMAL HEADED warriors (Anubis, Horus,
Thoth)... taking children... families ripped apart.

Daniel and Sari lean close. The images disturbing, harsh.
They move the torch down the wall.

The next drawings depict... slaves herded together... the
warriors brutalizing them... shepherding them across the
desert over to... THE STAR GATE.

Alongside these pictures, Daniel SEES the first of some
hieroglyphic symbols.

DANIEL
The symbol for slavery... seama!

SARI
(correcting)
Seema?

Surprised, he turns to Sari.

DANIEL
(pointing to symbol)
Semer?
SARI
Seema.
DANIEL
Seema!

Quickly Daniel rushes over to another symbol, pointing.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Nefer?

Sari wrinkles her brow, she doesn't understand. She walks
over, close, staring uncomprehendingly at the symbol. Daniel
tries another pronunciation.

DANIEL (CONT'D)

Nefeer?
SARI
(correcting)
Nefaar?
DANIEL
Nefaar! Yes! Teach me to speak.
Teach... um... Takera.
SARI

Takeer?

EXT. NAGADA - PRE-DAWN

The last dust of the sand storm is settling. The night is
soon over.

INT. O'NEIL'S SLEEPING CHAMBER - PER-DAWN
O'Neil stands over Brown who works the radio.

BROWN
Nothing.

O'NEIL
More interference?

BROWN
No. They're simply not there.

KAWALSKY (0.S.)
Colonel!

O'Neil walks out of the room, onto the bridge.
O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - KAWALSKY IN STREET
Kawalsky comes rushing down the street.
KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
Jackson's not in his room. I can't
find him anywhere.
Kawalsky holds up Daniel's jacket.
MASTADGE CORRAL
Skaara and the other shepherd boys work the corral. Skaara
turns, looking down the street he SEES O'Neil meeting up
with Kawalsky.
ANGLE - KAWALSKY AND O'NEIL
O'Neil takes Daniel's jacket from him.
O'NEIL
We've lost radio contact. Get Brown.
Find Daniel. I want to leave as
soon as possible.

KAWALSKY
Yes, Sir.

Kawalsky salutes as he takes off. Skaara watching from the
corral, practices a salute.

Just then O'Neil turns, spots him and marches over.

O'NEIL
I'm looking for Jackson... Of course
they can't understand a word.

O'Neil holds up Daniel's jacket.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Jackson, see. Jackson.

They don't get it at all. Instead they suddenly all begin
to SALUTE. O'Neil is not good at this and he knows it.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Jackson. Uh, like this. Jackson.

O'Neil forms circles with his hands and holds them over his
eyes imitating GLASSES. The boys copy his movement, holding
their cupped hands over their eyes. They all giggle.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
No. I mean...

Adding the final touch, O'Neil SNEEZES. Suddenly Skaara
REALIZES. He runs over to O'Neil and SNATCHES the jacket
away from him. He rushes off with it across the corral.

Skaara holds it up to the nose of Daniel's Mastadge. Suddenly
the Mastadge REARS UP, ROARING. Quickly Skaara opens the
corral gate and the Mastadge RACES out. Coming around the
corner, Kawalsky and Brown have to LEAP out of the way as

the Mastadge charges past.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)

Smart kid.
CUT TO:
BLACK SCREEN 188
Until the flickering light of a torch is moved into frame.
Now we see printed on a wall the drawings of... a YOUNG BOY,
bathed in light from a pyramid above him... the boy adorned

in PHARAOHS CLOTHING, the animal headed warriors bowing to
him...

WIDEN TO REVEAL:
INT. CATACOMBS - PER-DAWN 189
Daniel moves the torch slowly over the wall. To our surprise

he says something to Sari in her own language. She responds
in kind.
71.

O'NEIL (0.S.)
I thought you couldn't speak their
language.

Daniel SPINS, his torch illuminating O'NEIL who stands before
him, Skaara at his side. Startled, Daniel has to catch his
breath.

DANIEL
It's ancient Egyptian. I just didn't
know how to pronounce it. No one
has heard it spoken in over two
thousand years.

O'NEIL
Jackson, what is all this?

Behind him we SEE Kawalsky and Brown roaming through,
fascinated by what they see.

DANIEL
A history of the people who first
came to this world.

Daniel turns back to the tableau on the wall, pointing to
it.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Look, here, this is Ra, the God these
people worship. He was a young boy,
taken by people from distant stars
who turned him into a God.

He points to the drawings of the boy becoming a Pharaoh.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Once a God, Ra betrayed his own
people, enslaving them to serve his
masters.

Daniel points to a series of drawings of Ra, ruling his
people.

O'Neil suddenly becomes very interested. Slowly we PUSH IN
close as we study O'Neil's intense curiosity.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
They taught him how to build the
great pyramid of Giza. They gave
him eternal life. They made him
ruler of all mankind. And in return
he gave them...people.

Daniel stops reading, turning back to O'Neil.
190

191

72.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Workers for the mines. He sold out
man in order to be a God.

O'Neil looks concerned, lost in thought. There is a pregnant
pause as he takes this all in.

KAWALSKY (0.S.)
Jackson, I think you better take a
look at this.

At the end of the corridor, Kawalsky steps out, holding a
flash light.

ANGLE - OTHER CORRIDOR 190

Daniel, O'Neil and Sari join Kawalsky and Brown who stare in
awe at something before them...

ALTAR 191

Enshrined in sacred writings, this whole section is dedicated
to a single cartouche at the wall's center, half buried in
the sand. We recognise the cartouche as the same one we saw
on the tablets.

Daniel rushes over to it, examining, digging out the covered
portion of the cartouche. The others crowd in behind him,
anxious, tense.

DANIEL
They must have kept it here in hopes
that one day the gate to Earth could
be reopened.

These definitely match the signs on the Star Gate. But as
Daniel's hand moves down the six main SYMBOLS, we discover
the last piece of the cartouche has BROKEN OFF.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(panicked)
Where's the seventh sign?

Frantically Daniel digs in the dirt looking for something.
Realizing what he is doing, the team drops to the ground,
digging. Sari, not understanding, holds the torch.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I think I got it!

He pulls a piece of fractured wall out of the dirt. It FITS
in perfectly with the cartouche, but the piece is WORN CLEAR.
The SYMBOL IS GONE.

Daniel and the soldiers are STUNNED. Their hopes of returning
home, dashed. Probably forever. O'Neil gets a determined
look in his eye. He turns, making his way out.

DANIEL
But it won't work without the last

symbol.
O'Neil doesn't even look back.
CUT TO:
EXT. NAGADA - DAWN 192
Sand pours through as the front gates to Nagada open. O'Neil
leads our team as they march out through the gates. At the
back of the pack, Daniel trails behind, looking back over
his shoulder.
We CRANE UP to the bridge above the gate just as Sari comes
rushing over. She stops at the top of the gate, staring at
the men as they depart.
ANGLE - TEAM - SAND DUNES - SAME 193

With new resolve, O'Neil marches ahead. There's something
different about him now. An adamant look in his eye.

KAWALSKY
Hurry up, Jackson.

O'NEIL
Forget him. He's useless to us now.

Surprised Kawalsky looks over at Brown who can only shrug.
Behind them Daniel looks back at Sari.

DANIEL'S P.O.V. - SARI 194
AS we PULL BACK away from her. Sadly, she watches him depart.
EXT. DESERT - DUNES - MORNING 195
Silhouetted against the rising sun we see the lonely image

of the team walking across the dunes. Indefatigable, O'Neil
presses on. Kawalsky wipes his brow as Brown takes a swig

from his canteen.

Daniel catches up with them and reaches out for a drink but
Brown pulls it away. Kawalsky turns, spotting something.

KAWALSKY'S P.0.V. - SKAARA AND BOYS 196

Skaara and the shepherd boys come rushing up over the dune.
Playfully wanting to join up with them.

KAWALSKY
Sir, I think you made some friends.

O'Neil turns and sees them.

O'NEIL
Jackson, get rid of them.

O'Neil presses onward as Daniel tells them to leave, but
they follow regardless. O'Neil looks back.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
I said, get rid of â€˜em!

DANIEL
I tried.

O'Neil STOPS, draws his pistol and FIRES towards the Boys,
his bullets RIPPING into the sand in front of them.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Jesus Christ!

The Boys jump back, tumbling down the sand. Quickly they
retreat behind a dune.

 

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You didn't have to do that!

O'Neil simply turns and marches on. Even Kawalsky and Brown
are shocked. As the team disappears over the next dune...

SKAARA 197

pokes his head back up from behind the last dune. Hurt and
betrayed, Skaara sadly watches the team walk away.

CUT TO:
EXT. DUNES - LATER - DAY 198
Several yards ahead of the team, O'Neil continues, undaunted.
Together they climb a STEEP DUNE. As they near the top they
SEE O'Neil suddenly DROP to his knees.
Reacting, the soldiers rush up the hill. Daniel, not
understanding, hurries to catch them. Turning back, Kawalsky
waves for him to drop. Daniel does, crawling to meet them.
DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - PYRAMID 199

As Daniel clears the top of the dune we REVEAL the Pyramid
with the SPACE CRAFT perched on top.

PYRAMID SPACE CRAFT 200

For the first time we can clearly see the breadth of this
amazing vessel, ornate and technical at the same time.
Unfolded, the craft nearly covers the entire pyramid it sits
on. The team stares in awe.
201

75.
There's a long pause. O'Neil lifts a small pair of binoculars
and SEES the half buried base camp, destroyed and abandoned.
Suddenly O'Neil SNAPS a clip into his rifle.
O'NEIL
Lieutenant, I've got to get to the
StarGate at all costs. Cover me.

KAWALSKY
But Sir...

Suddenly O'Neil TAKES OFF, scurrying down the dunes, making
his way to the pyramid entrance.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
Shit! Jackson, stay close.

DANIEL
What is happening here?

Kawalsky throws his rifle to Daniel, drawing his pistol.
Daniel is totally confused.

KAWALSKY
Ready?

Nervously, Brown nods. Kawalsky TAKES OFF after O'Neil.

EXT. ENTRANCE RAMP - SAME 201
O'Neil has taken a position behind the obelisks. He sees

the team making their way down. He waves them on towards

the entrance.

ANGLE - SKAARA AND SHEPHERD BOYS 202

Climbing up behind another dune, they spy down the hill at
O'Neil as he moves towards the entrance.

EXT. ENTRANCE PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 203

O'Neil takes cover next to the entrance door meeting up with
the rest of the squad.

O'NEIL
Two teams. Lieutenant, you and Brown
take the rear.
O'Neil darts inside. Daniel doesn't know what to do.

KAWALSKY
Go!

Daniel follows O'Neil.

INT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS 204

Column by column, O'Neil makes his way down the large entrance
hall. Clumsily Daniel hauls the rifle behind. As they enter
they SEE Feretti's radio, the helmet, assorted equipment.
Daniel swallows hard.

Behind them, Kawalsky and Brown creep down the opposite row

of columns, weapons ready. Just as they pass we see a SHADOW
move across the wall behind them.

EXT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SHEPHERD BOYS - SAME 205

The Shepherd boys sneak up the side of the structure. Skaara
creeps up a dune over to a small window.

DANIEL AND O'NEIL 206
Pressed against a column. O'Neil moves forward, choosing

his path. Daniel looks back, something MOVES. He leans the
opposite direction just in time to SEE...

SHADOW 207
A huge shadow, human form but with a HAWK-LIKE HEAD. Daniel
reacts, turns to O'Neil but O'Neil is GONE. Scared, Daniel

grips the rifle tight.

BROWN 208
Brown steps out from behind a column when WHACK, something

hits him across the head, SPINNING HIM. As he recovers BLAST,

a strange POWER BURST to his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM against

the post.

WINDOW - SKAARA 209

Peering in through a window we SEE Skaara straining to see
inside.

SKAARA'S P.0.V. - BROWN 210
Writhing in pain, Brown screams as Horus SLAMS the rear of

his weapon into him. Skaara's eyes go wide with fear as he
retreats to tell the others.

O'NEIL 211

Spins, sees something and LEAPS out of the way as a POWER
BURST EXPLODES into the column behind him.

Kawalsky JUMPS out FIRING. Out of nowhere his weapon is
SMASHED, knocked out of his hand. He spins, his eyes widen
as he SEES...
212

213

214

215

77.
HORUS 212

Body of a man, the head, a metallic textured sculpture of a
HAWK. He SWINGS his weapon at Kawalsky who grabs hold with
all his strength. Kawalsky grapples with Horus who TWISTS
his weapon free, then SMASHES it into Kawalsky's chest.

Holding his rifle tentatively, Daniel steps out from behind
a column just in time to SEE... Kawalsky SAILS across the
hallway, SLAMMING into a column, collapsing in a heap. Just
then Daniel SEES Horus crossing the hallway, moving in on
Kawalsky.

Daniel is in total shock, his eyes wide with fear. Standing
out there, he's a sitting duck. Suddenly a HAND reaches for
him and GRABS HIM, yanking him back to safety.

O'NEIL 213

Holds Daniel tight against the wall, leaning close to his
face.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
Cover me.

DANIEL
Wha...?

O'Neil makes a DASH for the door leading to the StarGate.
Daniel gathers his strength and follows, attempting to cover
the rear as he runs.

INT. GRAND GALLERY - CONTINUOUS 214

A FLARE tumbles towards us, O'Neil rushing up from behind.
In the flickering light we see Daniel, stumbling after O'Neil
trying to keep his rifle pointed to the rear.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 215

The darkness is broken with another FLARE as it rolls towards
us. O'Neil rushes through the Medallion room straight over
to the wheeled vehicle standing next to the StarGate. Daniel
races in, moving over towards O'Neil.

O'NEIL
(scolding)
Get back to the door!

DANIEL
What about Kawalsky and Brown?

O'NEIL
You heard me, move!

Daniel reluctantly moves over towards the medallion, aiming
his gun into the Grand Gallery.
216

78.

O'Neil retrieves the electric KEY from his pocket. He turns
a dial and a RED LIGHT begins to FLASH.

DANIEL
What are you doing?!

O'NEIL
I said cover me, Goddamnit!

O'Neil takes out the tool and opens the secret compartment
of the vehicle only to find it EMPTY. O'Neil is in total
SHOCK.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
It's gone!

Pissed and scared, Daniel turns back to O'Neil.

DANIEL
What is?

Just as Daniel turns a LASER traces the edges of the MEDALLION
on the floor. A BEAM appears just as the image of a man
MATERIALIZES behind Daniel's back.

Fully realized, we see it's ANUBIS, his weapon aimed.

O'Neil looks up and SEES Anubis. Slowly he lifts his arms
in surrender. Seeing this Daniel SPINS, his rifle shaking
in nervous hands.

O'NEIL
(suddenly calm)
Jackson, put it down.

Anubis steps into the flickering light of the flare. For
the first time we can SEE the details of this strange
creature.

Stepping close, he runs his palm beneath his weapon and the
barrel SNAPS OPEN ready to fire. Daniel lowers his rifle.

INT. SPACE CRAFT - MEDALLION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 216
Like the medallion below, a laser traces the floor,

illuminating this dark room. Once surrounding the medallion,
SHAPES begin to form. Soon we SEE it's O'Neil, Daniel and
Anubis.

The beam VANISHES and a circular door SLIDES open.

INT. RA'S THRONE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 217
As the door opens we find HORUS waiting. He and Anubis lead

Daniel and O'Neil into the room. Suddenly a loud SOUND is
heard and the wall before them slowly begins to PART.

EXT. PYRAMID - SPACE CRAFT - TOP SECTION - DAY 218

Slowly the top of the pyramid begins to OPEN UP, the planet's
three suns behind it. The paneling slides back revealing
the palace beneath.

INT. RA'S THRONE CHAMBER - SAME 219

They march down the center of this beautiful palace room.
Light begins to STREAM IN from the openings above. They
reach the far wall of the room and Horus THROWS Daniel to
the floor. O'Neil SPINS, ready to fight.

DANIEL
(stage whisper)
Kneel.

Reluctantly O'Neil turns and bows down to his knees. Daniel
looks up from the ground and sees A GOLDEN SUN DISK adorning
the wall before him.

From all around SUNLIGHT pours in, bathing Daniel and O'Neil
in bright light. As the light reaches the SUN DISK, the
doors in front of them SLIDE OPEN revealing another room.

Standing in front of a large set of stairs leading to a
platform, we SEE a dozen human CHILDREN, ranging from 9 to
17 years of age, elaborately dressed, huddled together,
blocking our view. Slowly they peel away from the center
revealing...

PHARAOH KING RA 220

Perched on his throne, adorned with jewels and headdress
like an ancient Pharaoh, RA looks like a living version of
the mask of Tutankhamun, part humanoid, part other worldly.

Daniel and O'Neil, who look up at the strange creature before
them. There is a long awkward silence as Ra examines them
from his perch. Turning away, Ra lifts his hand, pointing

to Anubis.

ANUBIS 221

touches a switch on the collar of his outfit and suddenly
the Jackal head MORPS into the cold but handsome face of a
HUMAN, the real man behind the mask.

Ra turns towards Horus, who also begins to CHANGE SHAPE.
His Hawk mask peeling back to reveal the MAN underneath; a
dark skinned North African with joyless eyes.

Neither O'Neil nor Daniel can believe their own eyes as these
creatures unmask before them. Daniel nervously looks up
towards Ra. After a long beat Ra gives a nod to the children.
222

80.

Two young BOYS walk up from behind Ra carrying a tray.
O'Neil's DEVICE, stolen from the wheeled vehicle, lays
dismantled on the tray. The children place it in front of
Daniel and O'Neil.

Daniel stares at it confused. O'Neil only stares at Ra
defiantly. Daniel notices the English words and numbers
printed around the device. He turns to O'Neil, bewildered.

DANIEL
(whispered)
What is that?

O'Neil only continues his glare to Ra. Daniel begins to
panic, his mind racing.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
That's what you were looking for.
What you couldn't find...

Daniel looks back to Ra who stares down at them, cold.
Turning back to the device, Daniel starts to realize what
he's looking at.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(incredulous)

...you were going to destroy this

place!? Why?

Suddenly Ra STANDS. As we PUSH IN we SEE...
RA - CLOSE - SFX 222

Suddenly Ra's entire shape begins to MORPH, his image shifting
and changing. His golden skin PEELS AWAY as his headdress
RETRACTS behind his head, revealing a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
MAN/CHILD, RA. Though ten thousand years have passed, he
looks but slightly older than when we saw him in the film's
opening.

As Ra is unveiled, Horus and Anubis BOW their heads. Seeing
this from the corner of his eye, O'Neil seizes the
opportunity. He POPS UP, throwing a shoulder into Anubis'
chest, wresting his weapon from him. He SLAMS Anubis with
the butt end, knocking him to the floor.

In one swift move, he copies the gesture he saw Anubis make
and SNAPS the weapon OPEN and FIRES at Horus, catching him
in the shoulder, SPINNING HIM to the floor.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(panicked)
No! Don't! Stop it!

But O'Neil TURNS, takes quick aim and FIRES at Ra. Just as
the power blast leaves the weapon a CLEAR SHIELD forms around
Ra. The power blast is DEFLECTED.

Horus grabs his weapon, spins. Daniel steps between them,
screaming out to them in their language. But, too date, |
Horus FIRES. The blast RIPS INTO DANIEL KILLING HIM.

second BLAST hits O'Neil in the shoulder, cutting into him.
O'Neil hits the floor, writhing in intense pain.

Ra steps down from his throne. He walks towards Anubis,
retrieving his fallen weapon. For a moment we think he may
kill him. Instead he THROWS the weapon at him.

Ra walks over to Daniel, staring down at his lifeless body
when something catches his eye. Ra kneels down, reaches
over and touches the SUN DISK around Daniel's neck.

SUN DISK - NECKLACE - EXTREME CLOSE UP

Hanging from Daniel's neck, Ra fingers the golden sun disk
examining it.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DUNES - DAY

Slowly Daniel's Mastadge appears behind a dune and HOWLS, a
single beautiful note of pain.

EXT. BASE CAMP

Buried in the sand, an exposed tent flap is PULLED aside and
the Shepherd boys SEE Daniel's Mastadge appearing behind
them.

They turn back, digging for more treasure. Skaara uncovers

one of the soldier's HELMETS. He shows it to the other boys.

Just then a LOUD HUM is heard. The Boys look up to SEE...
GLIDER BAY - SPACE CRAFT

The Glider bay OPENS and two GLIDERS shoot out into the sky.
ANGLE - SHEPHERD BOYS

The Boys DUCK for cover under the tent as the two Gliders
SAIL past, disappearing from view.

INT. HOLDING CELL - SAME

A square HOLE in the ceiling OPENS as the bars that cover it
recede. Unconscious, O'Neil body DROPS through, landing
with a SPLASH into the shallow muddy water of this cell.

The cold water reviving him, O'Neil BOLTS up awakened.
Suddenly two arms GRAB HIM. Still in shock, O'Neil tries to
shake free. Finally he realises it's Kawalsky holding him.

KAWALSKY

Adjusting to the dark room O'Neil SEES, Feretti and Freeman
SHIVERING at the back of the room. Between them two BODIES
float face down in the murky waters.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
Sir?

O'Neil only nods.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)
And Jackson?

O'NEIL
He's dead.

CUT TO:
EXT. DUNES - LATE AFTERNOON 229
The Shepherd boys return from the pyramid, the Mastadge with
them, packages strapped to its sides. Suddenly a SOUND is
heard. The boys STOP as they SEE...
TWO WINGED GLIDERS 230
Heading right at them, darting out from over the dunes.
GLIDER P.O.V. - SHEPHERD BOYS 231
Sailing overhead we see the small group of boys staring up
at us, astounded at what they see. Just as it passes overhead
they get a mere glimpse at ANUBIS as he peers down at them.
Once gone, the boys race to the top of the dune to see where
the Gliders have just left; Nagada, a black plume of smoke
rising from the center of the town.
EXT. NAGADA - INSIDE TOWN - THROUGH GATES - LATE AFTERNOON 232
The boys approach the front gates, entering the town slowly.
From their expressions we SEE they are shocked at what they
find.
SHEPHERD BOYS' P.0O.V. - DECIMATED STREET - SAME 233
People crying, comforting one another. Charred buildings, a
small flame being extinguished. Wounded people getting tended
to. Misery.
The boys move slowly down the center of the street, fear and
anger in their eyes. Skaara sees Sari crying at the side of
the street. He rushes to her.
ANGLE - SARI 234

As Skaara approaches, Sari lifts her head and we SEE a CUT
above her eye, blood dripping down her face.

Skaara looks at her, wanting to understand. Sari only looks
up. Skaara follows her gaze to SEE...

KASUF - HANGING 235

Strapped to the Sun Disk we SEE Kasuf suspended above, beaten,
barely conscious. We PUSH into Skaara's troubled face, tears
and anger well in his eyes.

CUT TO:
INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - LATER 236

Silent and still, the sarcophagus sits at the back of the
room. Slowly we MOVE closer to it just as its sides begin
to retract, exposing a FIGURE covered in wet cloth laying
motionless.

As the sarcophagus completes this process the figure suddenly
SITS UP, frantically GASPING for air. Coughing, the figure
rips off the wet cloth, revealing...

DANIEL 237

Reborn. Daniel struggles to regain normal breathing. Finally
he calms down and looks around to see where he is.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - EMPTY ROOM 238

Daniel scans the quiet, eerie room. He's startled as he
SEES a young seven year old BOY standing in the doorway.
Emotionless and completely still, the Boy stares at Daniel.

Slowly Daniel gets to his feet, attempting to regain his
balance. Once up, the Boy turns and walks out of the room.
Daniel is unsure if he should follow. Suddenly the Boy STOPS,
turns back, staring at Daniel. Daniel takes a step towards
him and the Boy continues.

INT. PALACE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 239

Several yards ahead of him, the Boy leads Daniel down this
immense and imposing hallway. Daniel follows, disorientated,
his eyes scanning the room. He sees a CAT cross his path.

Surprised, Daniel continues down and he sees ANOTHER cat,
perched on a short flight of stairs. Still walking forward,
Daniel turns back towards the Boy, only to find he's GONE.

Daniel looks ahead and sees another doorway. Assuming the
Boy went through, Daniel cautiously follows.

INT. BATH CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 240
Slowly Daniel enters. He pushes his way through thin silk

veils which hang down from the ceiling. Daniel moves through
them until he SEES...
241

242

84.
RA - BATH 241

Ra sits in his ornate sunken bath. Daniel watches him for a
long beat. Sensing his presence, Ra ignores Daniel, signals
to the children who come, carrying his long robe.

Holding it before him, Ra walks out of the bath, into his
robe, passing Daniel on his way out. Daniel turns to him
and speaks.

DANIEL
(subtitled)
I died.

Surprised Daniel can speak his language, Ra stops and turns
towards him. A subtle smile crosses Ra's lips. He then
turns away and exits the room. Reluctantly, Daniel follows.

INT. RA'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 242

Ra leads Daniel across the room past a long marble table.
On which are the recovered belongings of the soldiers
displayed; guns, books, radio and the dismantled bomb. Ra
turns back to Daniel, studies his reaction for a long beat.
Finally...

RA
(subtitled)
You people have advanced much since
I left. Your world has
become. ..dangerous.

Realizing the implication, Daniel gets nervous

DANIEL
(subtitled)
What are you going to do?

RA
(subtitled)
Tomorrow we will send the quartz to
my masters. I will include all I
have discovered.

Off Daniel's frightened expression, Ra smiles as he walks
away.

RA (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
It will be up to them to decide.

Moving over to a sitting area, Ra is met by the children who
bring his clothing over to him and start to dress him. Daniel
moves over towards him.
243

85.

DANIEL
(subtitled)
Why did you give me back my life?

RA
(subtitled)
I need you.

Daniel doesn't understand.

RA (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
You must restore...faith.

DANIEL
(subtitled)
Faith?

Ra nods to one of his children who pulls out a small tray,
Daniel's Sun Disk laying on top. Ra takes it, holds it.

RA
(subtitled)
There can only be one Ra.

He hands the Sun Disk back to Daniel.

RA (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
You will obey me before my people.
They will witness as you kill your
companions.

Dressed, Ra stands and walks away from Daniel. Taking it
all in, Daniel thinks to himself for a beat. Finally...

DANIEL
(subtitled)
And I refuse?
Daniel turns back to Ra only to find Anubis standing behind
him, lifting his weapon. Ra turns back to Daniel to see if
he understands. He does.
CUT TO:
TRAVELING P.O.V. - TOWARDS CURTAINS 243
We MOVE through darkness towards long hanging fabric. As we
PUSH through the fabric into BRIGHT LIGHT we see THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE gathered before us.

EXT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

O'Neil and the other prisoners are PUSHED out onto the
platform, led by HORUS down to the center of the ramp.

Using his weapon as a staff, Horus KNOCKS the soldiers down
to their knees. He leaves them there as he marches back up
to the top of the ramp, joined by another Horus (#2).

ANGLE - SARI

Moving through the dense crowd, straining to see if Daniel
is on the ramp. Unable to spot him, she's crestfallen.

TWO WINGED GLIDERS
Two winged Gliders hover above the platform.
DANIEL AND ANUBIS

With his mask in place, Anubis steps through the hanging
fabric, Daniel close to his side. O'Neil looks up, completely
shocked to discover Daniel still alive. He and the soldiers
exchange questioning glances.

Daniel avoids eye contact with the soldiers as Anubis leads
him next to the empty throne.

Sari SEES Daniel. Her expression brightens. She pushes
through the crowd to get nearer to the platform.

Leaving Daniel's side, Anubis steps to the center of the
platform, raising his arms. The entire crowd BOWS DOWN. We
see a very bruised Kasuf, helped by the town Elders to his
knees in prayer.

Anubis looks over to Daniel who reluctantly bows down before
the throne. The entire assembly bows and a dozen CHILDREN
rush out from behind the fabric, grabbing on to poles,
connected to the bottom of the material. The Children peel
off to the sides, LIFTING the fabric.

As it PARTS we SEE the striking image of RA, SUN GOD as he
slowly steps out into the light. Again, we see him with his
illusion/mask in place gold skin, elaborate headdress, etc.

Ra takes his place on the throne. Once seated, the crowd
stands, silently. Anubis stands and offers his weapon to
the Pharaoh. Ra accepts it. He turns and offers it to
Daniel.

Anubis puts his hand roughly on Daniel's shoulder. Daniel,
knowing what is expected of him, is torn. Slowly he stands
and accepts the weapon from Ra. Weapon in hand, Daniel turns
towards the ramp.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - SOLDIERS AND O'NEIL 248

Slowly Daniel walks past the two guards at the top of the
ramp, making his way towards O'Neil and the rest of the
soldiers. O'Neil looks up at Daniel as a traitor, contempt
in his eye.

Daniel is torn. Desperately he wants a way out of it. As
he walks he SEES, Sari in the crowd. He can't look at her.
He turns back to the faces of the Soldiers as he approaches.

Daniel stops a few feet in front of O'Neil who only stares
at him, harshly. Daniel turns, looks back to Ra who only
stares at him emotionlessly. He sees Anubis waiting next to
Ra, the two Horus guards at the top of the Ramp, and looking
up...

THE WINGED GLIDERS 249
Their weapons slowly EXTENDING, taking aim, ready.

Suddenly a small FLASH OF LIGHT, catches his eye. He looks
down into the crowd and SEES...

ANGLE - SKAARA 250

Moving near Sari below, next to the ramp. He holds O'Neil's
lighter, reflecting sunlight off of it at Daniel to get his
attention. That accomplished, Skaara peels back part of his
clothing exposing...

ONE OF THE SOLDIER'S RIFLES 251

Retrieved from the base camp, Skaara holds the gun close to
his chest. Skaara gives Daniel a nod. Daniel looks down to
the other side of the ramp and recognizes two OTHER Shepherd
boys, waiting.

Daniel turns back to O'Neil as he lifts the weapon, COCKING
it, ready to FIRE. Suddenly Daniel SPINS, and FIRES the
weapon at the top of the ramp.

A huge CHUNK of the ramp EXPLODES before the two guards,
blocking their view of Daniel.

Suddenly Skaara DRAWS the rifle and begins FIRING INTO THE
AIR. Quickly we SEE, Shepherd boys, scattered everywhere,
drawing weapons and FIRING.

The crowd panics, no one knows which way to run. Pandemonium.
Seizing the opportunity, Daniel and O'Neil JUMP off the ramp
in one direction, as the other soldiers LEAP off the other
side.

HORUS (#1) steps through the smoke and FIRES his weapon,
HITTING Freeman as he leaps.

He SCREAMS and dies before he can hit the ground.
On the opposite side, O'Neil and Daniel rush over to Sari
and Skaara. They both toss SHAWLS over them, disguising
them. Quickly they PUSH them into the crowd.
Kawalsky and Feretti turn back towards Freeman's body when
the shepherd boys RUSH over to them, tossing CLOTH over the
soldiers. Quickly they rush them into the mayhem of the
crowd.
ANGLE - ANUBIS 252
Signals to the Gliders.
GLIDERS 253
The Gliders readjust and DIVE down over the crowd, searching.
GLIDERS' P.O.V. - CROWD 254
Quickly we SAIL overhead, staring down as everyone races
away in different directions. Disguised, the soldiers can't
be seen within the mob.
Ra stands, furious. Anubis moves close but Ra shoves him
aside as he storms through the hanging fabric, back into the
pyramid.
ANGLE - DANIEL AND O'NEIL 255
Skaara and Sari lead Daniel and O'Neil over to the Mastadge,
who lets out a ROAR. Skaara shows O'Neil where to GRIP the
Mastadge at the side of the harness. Sari shows Daniel the
same on the other side.
Daniel turns to thank Sari just as Skaara GRABS THE MASTADGE'S
EAR. The Mastadge REAR UP and race away, dragging Daniel
and O'Neil with them.
ANGLE - DUNE 256
People rushing off around them, Skaara and Sari climb the
top of the dune to see the Mastadge far off, racing over the
dunes. They turn back and see...
THE GLIDERS 257

Soaring past them, giving chase, the Gliders head off into
the desert.

INT. RA'S PALACE - SAME 257A
In a mad tantrum, Ra storms through his palace, furious. He

EXT. SAND DUNES - MASTADGE - SAME 258

Holding on for dear life, O'Neil tightly grips the harness.
He looks back and sees the Gliders, speeding towards them.
O'Neil slaps at the side of the Mastadge.

O'NEIL
(yelling)
How do you make this stupid thing go
faster!

Barely holding on, Daniel PULLS himself up and GRABS onto
the Mastadge's EAR.

Again, the Mastadge KICKS UP speed, racing over the dunes.
ANGLE - GLIDER AND DUNES 259
Though the Mastadge has picked up speed, he's no match for
the Gliders who narrow the gap. The Gliders FIRE a power
burst at the Mastadge.
Missing, the power burst EXPLODES into the sand, a few feet
in front of the Mastadge. Startled, the Mastadge REARS UP
and takes off in another direction.
ANGLE - O'NEIL 260
He looks back, seeing the Gliders approach. He looks ahead.
O'NEIL
(yelling)
It's no use. When we're over the
next dune. We drop!

DANIEL
Drop?

GLIDERS 261

Racing towards us. As they look down, they see the Mastadge
ahead of them, disappearing over the dune.

REVERSE ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF DUNE 262

Tumbling down the dune, the Mastadge galloping ahead, Daniel
and O'Neil roll to a stop. Instantly O'Neil starts to BURY
HIMSELF in the sand. Picking up the cue, Daniel copies
O'Neil, throwing sand over himself.

Behind them we SEE the Gliders, heading this way. Can they
bury themselves in time?

The Gliders SWOOP DOWN but just as they clear the sand hill.
They find the Mastadge on the other side, but O'Neil and
Daniel are GONE!

The Gliders circle the area, but O'Neil and Daniel are nowhere
to be seen. The Gliders circle one more time. Seeing
nothing, they turn and head back.

ANGLE - SAND - CLOSE 264

Just as the Gliders pass overhead, disappearing over the
dune, O'Neil's and Daniel's heads POP OUT of the sand.

Quickly O'Neil climbs the dune, watching the Gliders depart
as Daniel spits out sand, climbing after him.

DANIEL
You think they'1l come back?

O'NEIL
Why should they? In an hour we'll
be buried alive.

Reaching the top of the dune, Daniel turns to see what O'Neil
is talking about. He SEES...

A SAND STORM 265

Moving quickly, a sand storm heads right this way. O'Neil
and Daniel are in the middle of nowhere. No escape.

The two winged Gliders sail towards the Glider bay openings
in the pyramid.

INT. RA'S SPACE CRAFT - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 267

The two Horus pilots march down the hall. As they pass a
hanging tapestry, we SEE their silhouetted bird images MORPH
down to their normal selves. As they pass the tapestry, we
recognize one as the North African guard (Horus #1) and Horus
#2.

INT. RA'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 268

Ra sits, seething with humiliation and anger. Anguished, Ra
sits privately when he's suddenly TUGGED by a YOUNG BOY (10
years old) who tries to get his attention.

Furious at the invasion, Ra SPINS and GLARES at the boy, his
eyes filled with rage. Terrified, the boy recoils. Ra stops
himself just as he looks up and SEES..

The other children standing in the doorway, watching
frightened. Ra marches through them, knocking them aside as
he passes.

INT. RA'S THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 268A

Seething with anger, Ra quickly marches into the room only
to find Anubis with the two Horus pilots who kneel, awaiting
his arrival. Ra stops, calms himself and sits on his throne
before them.

HORUS #1
(subtitled)
They are dead.

Ra slowly leans forward. The children arrive and gather
round Ra's throne.

RA
(subtitled)
Bring their bodies to me.
HORUS #2
(subtitled)

We lost them in the sand storm.
Surely they will be killed.

Ra boils, holding in his anger. He stands and walks over to
a box of jewelry. Hiding it from the others, Ra takes out a
GOLDEN RING AND DISK; the ring fitting over his finger, the

attached disk hid in the palm of his hand.

Turning back Ra moves slowly towards Horus #2, motioning
with his other hand for Horus #2 to stand. He does, sensing
something is not right.

Slowly Horus #1 backs away. The children exchange nervous
glances.

Horus #2 starts to get nervous, looking around the room. He
looks back to Ra who only smiles, reassuringly; everything's
alright. Horus #2 seems to calm down.

Ra lifts his hand as though to gently embrace his face when
suddenly he OPENS his palm exposing the DISK. Horus #2's
eyes go wide with fear but before he can react.. The disk
ACTIVATES. Horus #2 suddenly begins to SHAKE VIOLENTLY, his
features begin to DISTORT. He SCREAMS OUT IN PAIN. Ra
watches this torture emotionlessly, waiting for his victim
to expire. He does.

As he drops to the floor, Ra turns to the group of children
who stare back at him frightened. Ra motions for the OLDEST
BOY to step forward.

Ra reaches down and removes a HEAD CLAMP from the dead body
of Horus #2, placing it over the head of the Oldest Boy.

Quickly the HAWK-LIKE head APPEARS over the Oldest Boy as he
now takes his turn at guard.

CUT TO:
EXT. DUNES - SAND STORM - LATER 269

O'Neil and Daniel are fighting their way through the thick
whirling sands, holding onto the side of the Mastadge who
pushes onward through the storm.

They try to shield themselves at the side of the Mastadge,
but it does little to help. Movement becomes more and more
difficult. Daniel suddenly drops to his knees.

The Mastadge turns back and sees Daniel getting buried in
the sand and ROARS OUT. O'Neil lifts his arm holding it
over his eyes. He, too, drops down, losing consciousness.
The harsh winds quickly begin to bury the men in sand.
Unaffected by the storm, the Mastadge watches them, unable
to help.

Suddenly through the blurry sands we SEE several SHAPES
apparently coming UP FROM THE SAND. The figures GRAB onto
O'Neil, shaking him. Snapping out of it O'Neil squints up
to SEE...

SKAARA - SHEPHERD BOYS 270
Skaara and two other boys carry O'Neil and Daniel away.
INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 271

Through the mouth of a large cave we SEE several FIGURES
coming towards us through the sand clouds churning outside.
Helping them out of the storm we SEE Skaara and two boys
bringing Daniel and O'Neil inside.

Once within the protective walls, O'Neil looks up and SEES,
the rest of the Shepherd boys wearing the army fatigues,
helmets and guns they retrieved from the base camp. Leaning
against the wall, the weapon Ra gave Daniel.

At the back of the cave he SEES Feretti, getting some aid to
a wound. Kawalsky turns, sees O'Neil and rushes over to
him.

KAWALSKY
You made it!

Sari walks in from the opposite side, looking for Daniel.
Daniel begins to cough, only semi-conscious as he's helped
inside. Sari runs over to him, bringing him some water.
Realizing it's her, Daniel smiles.
93.

KAWALSKY (CONT'D)

(re: the kids)
What do you think, Colonel? It's not
exactly Special Forces but they're
obviously eager to join up.

O'Neil looks sad. He walks away.

O'NEIL
Take the guns away from them
Lieutenant before they hurt
themselves.

KAWALSKY
Sir?

O'NEIL
You heard me. Send them home.

Daniel looks up, his head clearing.

DANIEL
There's nowhere for them to go.
They were seen helping us. They'll
be hunted down and killed.

KAWALSKY
We could sure use the help, Sir.

O'Neil spins back to Kawalsky, suddenly furious.

O'NEIL
(exploding)
We've already lost four highly trained
men! Now you hand me a bunch of
kids?!

KAWALSKY
But, Sir, they saved our lives?

O'NEIL
For what!? To do what?

KAWALSKY
(unsure)
To help us get back home.
O'Neil looks at Kawalsky sadly. He turns and walks away.

DANIEL
Why don't you tell 'em the truth?

KAWALSKY
Truth?
94.

DANIEL
(to O'Neil)
Tell them why you planted a nuclear
bomb next to the StarGate.

KAWALSKY
What's he talking about, Colonel?

O'Neil doesn't answer. Finally...

O'NEIL
(calm)
My orders were simple. Cross the
bridge, hold the bridge, and at the
first sign of danger, destroy the
bridge.

KAWALSKY
Why didn't you tell us?

O'NEIL
It was strictly "need to know."

KAWALSKY
Need to know? Need to know? I think
that's something I'd need to know!

DANIEL
Do you realize what you've started?
Tomorrow, when they send off the
next delivery of quartz, Ra's going
to send them your Goddamned bomb.

O'NEIL
Send who?

DANIEL
Who do you think? Someone put him
in charge of all this. We're talking
about a highly advanced, oppressive
and hostile culture who use people
like we use cattle. We were no threat
to them. They wrote us off thousands
of years ago. How do you think
they're going to react when they
find out what we've become?!

O'Neil stands, considering his options. Sari and the Shepherd
boys stare at the argument, confused.

O'NEIL
Then we'll have to be there before
they can send it through. We get
back the device, I can destroy the
StarGate.
272

95.

Trying to talk some sense to O'Neil, Daniel walks over to
him. Frustrated, Daniel gets angry.

DANIEL
Destroying this one gate won't
accomplish anything! There are bound
to be more.

O'NEIL
You have a better idea?

DANIEL
We've got to get back home and
dismantle the gate on our side.
Then hope they leave us alone.

O'NEIL
Well, thanks to you, we don't have
that option.
(turning back to his
men)
Lieutenant, we leave this place at
first light.

O'Neil marches out into another part of the cave. Feretti,
who's been silent...

FERETTI
Great. A suicide mission.

INT. LOOKOUT CAVE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 272

Staring off, O'Neil stands alone in the middle of this cave.
Across from him we can see the storm raging outside.

DANIEL (0.S.)
You realize, if you go through with
this, a lot of innocent people will
be killed.

O'Neil doesn't answer, keeping his back to Daniel who stands
at the back of the cave.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
You were right you know. I only
cared about saving my reputation.
(beat)
I'm sorry I lied.

O'NEIL
Doesn't matter anymore.

There's a silent moment, but something Daniel has to ask.
273

96.

DANIEL
You knew from the beginning that
you'd have to destroy the gate, didn't
you?

O'NEIL
"Sealed and buried for all time."
That's how it translated, right? Why
would they bury it? Think? It was
a warning.

Daniel realizes he's right. How could he have been so blind?

DANIEL
I don't understand. If you knew,
how could you take this assignment?
You have a family? A son?

O'Neil stares off with the same distant look he had on when
we first saw him.

O'NEIL
I had a family.

Realizing, Daniel is moved. He offers...

DANIEL
I'm sorry. I know what it's like to
lose someone you love.

O'NEIL
No one should ever have to outlive
their own child. It just isn't right.

Suddenly Skaara appears behind them carrying a bowl of food
he holds out for O'Neil.

SKAARA
Anaasar?

O'Neil doesn't even look at him. He just walks away, over

to the edge of the cave, staring out into the night. Skaara,
afraid he said something wrong turns to Daniel. Daniel can't
face him and walks out.

Skaara considers a second, sniffs at the food to make sure
it's okay, then walks over to O'Neil.

ANGLE - O'NEIL 273

O'Neil sits at the edge of the cave, his mind a million light
years away. Skaara walks up alongside him.

SKAARA
Anaasar.
274

275

97.

Still O'Neil ignores him. Slowly Skaara slides the plate of
food in front of O'Neil's face as you would do to a reluctant
child. Finally O'Neil turns and sees Skaara's smiling face.

SKAARA (CONT'D)
Nakdes Anaasar.

O'NEIL
Anaasar, right.

Uncomfortable, O'Neil reluctantly takes the bowl from Skaara
who promptly sits down next to him. O'Neil begins to eat as
Skaara smiles proudly.

INT. CORNER OF CAVE - SAME 274

Daniel slowly walks back inside, troubled. He turns a corner
of the cave where Kawalsky and Feretti are conferring with
each other. But as Daniel nears, they suddenly become quiet,
giving Daniel the "cold shoulder."

INT. CAVE - MAIN ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 275

Daniel enters. He sees several of the Shepherd boys
surrounding Sari who prepares food for them. As Sari stokes
the flames below her cooking pot, Daniel walks up and serves
some food to one of the waiting Shepherd boys.

The boy stares at Daniel, shocked, then starts to giggle.
Even Sari looks up, surprised.

DANIEL
What?

Even Sari suppresses a laugh, turning away from him.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
Why are they laughing?

Sari takes the serving bowl from him and walks over to
Kawalsky and Feretti, feeding them. The boys continue to
chuckle at Daniel's expense. Daniel doesn't understand.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(subtitled; to boys)
Why do you laugh?

This just makes them laugh more. Finally one BOY (#2) turns
and answers.

BOY #2
(subtitled)
Husbands do not do this work.

Daniel is completely taken off guard.
276

277

98.

DANIEL
Husband?

Sari walks back over and Daniel turns to her.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
He called me your "husband."

Suddenly filled with embarrassment, Sari hurries away. Again
the boys titter with laughter. Daniel walks over to Sari at
the back of the cave.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
What is it?

Again, Sari is ashamed. She won't look Daniel in the eye.
Skaara enters, sees the boys giggling, peering around the
corner of the cave, spying on Daniel and Sari.

SKAARA'S P.O.V. - DANIEL AND SARI 276

Very close together, Daniel reaches over, touching Sari's
shoulder. Skaara, seeing this, turns and SHOOS the boys
away, giving Daniel and Sari some privacy.

DANIEL AND SARI 277
Still avoiding his eyes, Sari finally speaks to Daniel.

SARI
(subtitled)
I'm sorry. Don't be angry with me.
I didn't tell them.

DANIEL
(subtitled)
Tell them what?

SARI
(subtitled)
That you did not want me.

Sari turns away, shamed. Daniel realizes she's referring to
when she was brought to him in Nagada.

He slowly turns her back towards him. Gently he leans close
and kisses her.

Their lips part and Sari looks up at Daniel, searching his
emotions. Slowly she moves back to him. Again, they kiss.

INT. CAVE - DANIEL C.U. - LATER 278

His eyes fluttering open, Daniel wakes to see Sari curled up
alongside of him. Daniel smiles sadly. He turns, only to
find, a young Shepherd boy sleeping behind him.

As Daniel sits up he finds, all the Shepherd boys have taken
sleeping positions all around him and Sari. Daniel shakes
his head in disbelief. Suddenly something catches his eye
near the front of the cave.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - SKAARA 279

Skaara sits by a dying fire, working on some drawings he
scratches into the wall. Curious, Daniel stands and starts
to walk over to him.

Imitating the drawings seen earlier in the catacombs, Skaara
chalks up the wall of the cave with primitive sketches.

Pleased, Daniel smiles.
DANIEL'S P.0O.V. - SKETCHES - SAME 280

A simple set of drawings detailing the rescue in front of
the pyramid. We see figures of the boys firing their guns
and the soldiers in front of the pyramid, the three suns
surrounding it.

Suddenly Daniel's expression changes. Slowly he gets up and
moves closer to the sketches.

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - PYRAMID SKETCH 281

We slowly PUSH IN to the drawing of the team before the
pyramid, ZOOMING IN to the top part of the drawing; the
pyramid with three suns, one above, the other two on each
side.

DANIEL
My God. The point of origin.

Quickly Daniel moves close to the drawing. He takes the

burnt charcoal from Skaara and traces over the sketch. As
he did in the silo when detailing the symbol for Earth, he
outlines a symbol over the drawing of the pyramid and suns.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
I can't believe it.

KAWALSKY (0.S.)
Can't believe what?

Daniel spins to find Kawalsky approaching, wiping the sleep
from his eyes.

DANIEL
I found it.

KAWALSKY
What are you talking about?

DANIEL
The seventh sign. Our ticket home.

Peering through some rocks a distance away, the boys see the
caravan being put together. Skaara nods to the youngest
boy. They turn and sneak away.

284 INT. CAVE - SAME 284
O'Neil is confronting Daniel, packing weapons into his pack.

O'NEIL
It's too risky. We won't have the
time to get everyone through. We'll
have to take fast and immediate
action.

DANIEL
We can't just turn our backs on them.

O'NEIL
We don't have any choice! All we
can do is try and complete our
mission.

Suddenly Feretti steps up.

FERETTI
Sir, we owe our lives to them.

O'NEIL
Forget it! I have my orders.

O'Neil reaches for his rifle. Kawalsky grabs it first,
holding it firm. He leans close to O'Neil.

KAWALSKY
Then disobey those orders.

O'NEIL
Lieutenant!

KAWALSKY
No. Daniel is right. We won't
accomplish anything unless we tear
down the gate back home on Earth.
These kids are our best chance.

Daniel looks at Kawalsky, surprised and impressed. O'Neil
knows he's outnumbered. Suddenly Skaara rushes in. He blurts
something out to Daniel.

DANIEL
Colonel, are you with us or not?

Everyone turns to O'Neil for his decision. Finally...

O'NEIL
It better work.
CUT TO:
EXT. MINING AREA - CARAVAN - DAY 285

A caravan of four Mastadges have been assembled at the top
of the dune next to a nearby mining pit. An obelisk marks
the spot.

ANGLE - PIT 286

Workers climb the ladders burdened with heavy bags of quartz.
Horus (#1) stands watch over them as they make their way up
the dune.

One WORKER falls to his knees from heat exhaustion. Horus
turns and SCREAMS at the Worker to continue. The Worker
tries to get to his feet but can't. Again, he collapses.

Barking out commands, Horus marches over to the Worker and
KICKS him, savagely. He tries to stand but Horus KICKS him
again. As he moves in for the kill, the Worker suddenly
pulls off his hood, revealing...

DANIEL 287
Before Horus can lift his weapon, he comes face to face with

the nasty end of the weapon Ra gave Daniel. Daniel COCKS

OPEN, ready to fire.

Instantaneously all the surrounding workers whip out WEAPONS,
aimed right at Horus. They POP their hoods off, revealing

Sari, the soldiers and Shepherd boys.

ANGLE - MINING AREA 288

All around the workers STOP and turn, shocked. Kasuf,
overseeing the caravan, looks over, horrified.
102.
289 ANGLE - PIT - HORUS AND TEAM 289

Kawalsky wrestles the weapon away from Horus as Daniel gets
to his feet. Daniel and Kawalsky keep their weapons aimed
at Horus as Feretti begins to tie him up.

O'NEIL
Let's get going.

O'Neil signals Skaara and the boys who turn and move up the
hill to take over the caravan. But suddenly Kasuf, surrounded
by the Elders, leads a group of workers over to block the

path of the Shepherd boys.

Kasuf YELLS out to them, harshly. Their route blocked, a
stand off, Skaara turns back to O'Neil for guidance.

Distracted, Daniel turns around.

O'NEIL (CONT'D)
What's he saying?

DANIEL
(concerned)
He won't let them pass. He says
they'll bring misery to all the
people..warning them not to go against
the Gods.

O'Neil steps forward, LIFTING his weapon. The soldiers and
Shepherd boys turn to O'Neil. They can't believe he might
really kill these unarmed people.

O'NEIL
Out of our way.

Coolly O'Neil takes aim, cocking his rifle. Suddenly Daniel
yells.

DANIEL
No. Wait.

Daniel turns and touches the button on Horus' collar, the
Hawk illusion VANISHES. The workers are STUNNED. Horus,
humiliated, seethes. Daniel turns and moves back towards
Kasuf.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
Take a look at your Gods!

Suddenly Horus KNOCKS Feretti away, his hands freed. He
grabs back his weapon from Kawalsky, SLAMMING it into him as
he turns towards the unsuspecting Daniel. Seeing this, Sari
screams.

Daniel spins back just in time to see Horus LIFTING the
weapon, ready to fire. Without time to think, Daniel lifts
the weapon and FIRES.

Horus is BLOWN BACK, off his feet. He SLAMS back down, into
the sand, dead. Kasuf and the workers stare in disbelief.
Slowly they inch their way towards Horus.

Daniel stands there, frozen. He's never killed a man before
and can't believe he just has.

O'NEIL
Well, what are we waiting for?

Slowly Sari walks over to him, easing Daniel's weapon down.
She and Kawalsky slowly turn Daniel back and escort him up
the hill towards the caravan. Kasuf and the workers push
past them, moving closer to Horus.

ANGLE - HORUS

Stone cold dead, a trickle of blood runs out his mouth. The
workers stare at him, completely shocked.

Kasuf turns just in time to watch the caravan disappear over
the dunes.

They turn and march towards the pyramid entrance.
EXT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME 297

The first cart arrives at the base of the ramp and Skaara
unties Daniel's Mastadge, pulling it aside.

Skaara waves the cart ahead. The cart is PULLED up the stair
by its SIX workers.

As the cart slowly crawls up the ramp, the two Horus guards
appear at the entrance door, waiting.

Separated from Daniel, the Mastadge below MOANS, tugging at
its restraints trying to follow the cart. Skaara struggles
to calm the animal.

Frightened of being given away, none of the workers react to
the Mastadge. Heads bowed, they continue to PUSH the cart.

A second cart follows the first up the stairs.

Towering above them, Ra stands out on his balcony, looking

command, stopping the cart.

Skaara looks up worriedly. The Mastadge MOANING.

Horus walks slowly around the first cart, all the workers
keeping their heads bowed. Finally, he waves it through.

SKAARA 300
breathes a sigh of relief and looks over to Kawalsky and

Feretti who peer out from beneath their hoods. But when the
cart disappears through the door the Mastadge HOWLS.

INT. PYRAMID - ENTRANCE ROOM - THE SAME 303

As the huge entrance door SLAMS SHUT the two Horus guards
surround the cart. A third Horus (#4) enters from behind.

Horus #3 BARKS out a command but no one moves. Horus #2
walks over to the workers. Is it Daniel? He PULLS down the
first hood revealing a frightened SHEPHERD BOY.

Horus #2 THROWS him to the floor as he moves closer to the
next worker.

Horus #3, weapon trained, eyes the lot with suspicion as his
partner nears the next in line. He reaches up and PULLS
DOWN her hood, revealing SARI, her long hair falling to her
shoulders.

Horus #2 is taken off guard by finding a woman. He lifts
his weapon.

BURSTING OUT OF THE QUARTZ PILE, Daniel and O'Neil LIFT OUT
their WEAPONS and FIRE. At the same moment, the rest of the
Shepherd boys GRAB WEAPONS and FIRE.

The bullets KNOCK Horus #2 BACKWARDS, but it's Daniel's POWER
BURST from the alien weapon that BLOWS Horus #2 to PIECES.
The other two FIRE BACK, taking cover behind pillars. One

of the Shepherd boys is hit, goes DOWN.

Daniel grabs Sari, pulling her behind the cover of the cart.
The Shepherd boys kneel behind cover, FIRING.

O'Neil DASHES from his position moving behind another pillar.
Separated, Daniel turns and SEES a path to the hallway is
clear.

Crawling low, one of the Guards makes his way around the
side of the room. He peers out from his position and SEES...

GUARD'S P.O.V. - DANIEL 307

His back to him, Daniel is a clear target. The guard raises
his weapon and takes aim.

Sari, following him, SEES the guard leaning out from behind

a pillar. She SCREAMS OUT and tries to PUSH Daniel out of
harm's way. Daniel turns slowly towards her just as the
guard FIRES. Sari STEPS IN THE WAY, taking the SHOT intended
for Daniel.

DANIEL
No!

As Sari falls, Daniel spins and FIRES, BLOWING THE GUARD
AWAY. Daniel reaches down cradling Sari. She stares up at
Daniel, the life slowly leaving her eyes.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
Sari! No.

Suddenly the door leading to the grand gallery and StarGate
begins to CLOSE. Pinned down at the opposite end of the

Sari in his arms, Daniel just makes it inside as the door
behind him SLAMS DOWN, sealing the room. Exhausted and out
of breath, Daniel drops to his knees before the StarGate
holding Sari tightly.

SARI
Dan-el?

Daniel looks down to Sari who smiles up at him tenderly.
Gently her eyes roll back as her life leaves her. She dies
in his arms.

DANIEL
Sari...!

But it's too late. Stunned, he stands there, just a few
feet away from the StarGate. So close. Tears well in his
eyes.

Suddenly behind him, the medallion begins to ACTIVATE, the
laser beginning its trace around the perimeter. Daniel has
to make a decision; save himself or take a gigantic chance
for Sari. He decides.

Quickly he STEPS ONTO THE MEDALLION just before the laser
seals the perimeter. As the laser completes its cylinder we
SEE a piece of Sari's dress get CAUGHT outside the cylinder.
The cloth is SEVERED. Gently it sails to the floor.

We FOLLOW the cloth to the ground. Behind it we SEE the
last of Daniel's image disappear, a GUARD'S FOOT taking his
place. The foot walks off the medallion stepping on the
cloth.

We PAN UP to reveal ANUBIS. The doors leading out re-open
and Anubis makes his way towards the entrance hall.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME 313

The last of the guards steps out from behind one of the
pillars when BLAM, he gets blasted by O'Neil. O'Neil rushes
over to one of the fallen Shepherd boys. Too late, he's
gone. Frustrated O'Neil moves to the closed front door,
searching for something that could open it. Nothing.

Suddenly, behind him, the door to the ground gallery begins
to LIFT OPEN. O'Neil dashes for the cover of a pillar as
Anubis slowly makes his way into the room.

EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 314

An EXPLOSION rips up the sand as the four Gliders STRAFE
from above. The Shepherd boys rush for cover all over the
front of the entrance, separated.

Racing down the ramp another EXPLOSION HITS, ripping up the
stairs killing one of the Shepherd boys. Skaara FIRES his
rifle at the passing Gliders as he reaches the sand.

At the side of the platform, Kawalsky and Feretti take cover
at the side of the closed door.

FERETTI
We're getting slaughtered out here.
We've got to do something.

Kawalsky SEES one of the carts standing between the obelisks.
Suddenly Kawalsky TAKES OFF RUNNING.

FERETTI (CONT'D)
Kawalsky!

But Kawalsky keeps going. Two GLIDERS BANK, spotting him.
As Kawalsky runs down the ramp, the Gliders DIVE shooting at
him, ripping up the rampway. Kawalsky, nearly hit, keeps
going.

Feretti sees Kawalsky heading towards one of the fallen carts.
Taking cue, Feretti RUNS out after him. Heroically, Kawalsky
LIFTS up the re-enforced bottom of the cart, dragging it
back towards another cart, the sand EXPLODING around him.

Skaara rushes over to help. Kawalsky and Feretti turn over
the carts, making a small fortress between the obelisks.
Skaara WAVES for the others to come and take cover.

The other boys DASH out from their positions, racing for the
cover of the toppled carts, POWER BURSTS blasting all over.

Skaara screams out for the last of the Shepherd boys who
RUNS, full speed. Just before he gets there, BLAST, he's
knocked off his feet, laying sprawled out over the sand.

Devastated, Skaara stares at his fallen friend. Kawalsky
SEES this and eases Skaara back down below the safety of the
barricade.

INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME 315

Carrying Sari, Daniel walks into the sarcophagus room. He
lays Sari's lifeless body down in the open sarcophagus. As
he steps back the sarcophagus slowly CLOSES around her.
Overcome with emotion, Daniel moves back, waiting, helpless.

Opening his jewelry box, Ra retrieves the ring and disk he
used to dispose his guard. Slowly he places it over his
finger, adjusting the disk in the palm of his hand.

INT. PYRAMID - ENTRANCE ROOM - SAME 317

Anubis stands over two of his fallen comrades. He lifts his
weapon, scanning the area. Suddenly he SEES O'Neil, laying
on the ground. Anubis kicks the body, nothing. Just as
Anubis is about to move on, TRIP, O'Neil GRABS his leg.

Anubis hits the floor, HARD. O'Neil LEAPS on top of him,
hitting the button on Anubis' collar. The protective mask
VANISHES.

And PUNCH, O'Neil slams his fist into Anubis' face, knocking
him unconscious. O'Neil quickly gets up and takes off running
for the StarGate.

EXT. PYRAMID ENTRANCE - SAME 317A

The four Gliders are circling above, BOMBARDING the barricade
below. The Shepherd boys are ducked down as Kawalsky turns
to Feretti.

KAWALSKY
We've got to concentrate all our
firepower at the same target.

Just then one of the GLIDERS swoops down from over the
entrance, straight towards him. Kawalsky points to the
Glider. The Shepherd boys understand and they all lift their
weapons at the same time.

As the Glider DIVES DOWN, Kawalsky, Feretti, Skaara and the
boys all STAND and OPEN FIRE.

ANGLE - GLIDER 317B
A BARRAGE of bullets SLAM into the Glider. It SWERVES wildly,

its wing SMASHING into the top of the obelisk. The Glider

SPINS out of control, disappearing over the dune.

In a gigantic FIREBALL, the Glider EXPLODES as it crashes
behind the dune. The Shepherd boys CHEER!

INT. SPACE CRAFT - THRONE CHAMBER - SAME 318
Through the doorway, we SEE Daniel stepping backwards. In

the foreground we SEE Ra step into view. Surprised to see
Daniel, Ra watches Daniel for a moment, fascinated.

INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME 319

Daniel waits, helpless as Ra enters. Slowly Ra encircles
him, studying him. Daniel tries to keep his distance as Ra
moves around him. Suddenly Ra stops, a puzzled look on his
face.

RA
(subtitled)
Why? Why would you come here now?

Slowly Ra turns away from Daniel, looking over at his
sarcophagus. When he looks back and sees the frightened
look on Daniel's face, he realizes he's hit it. Slowly he
moves towards the sarcophagus.

Daniel RUNS towards him to stop him. He LUNGES at Ra, but
SLAMS into the invisible shield, falling backwards. Ra stops,
looks back to Daniel through the rippling waves of his shield,
superior and unstoppable.

As Daniel tries to recover he SEES, Ra running his hand over
the sarcophagus.

DANIEL
No!

The sarcophagus slowly OPENS revealing Sari. Ra turns back
to Daniel, surprised and intrigued.

RA
(subtitled)
How romantic.

As Ra moves back towards Daniel we SEE Sari's eyes flutter
open. Not yet fully healed, yet life restored.

RA (CONT'D)
(subtitled)
You will die together.

Menacingly, Ra makes his way closer to Daniel. Slowly he
LIFTS his hand, exposing the DISK in his palm. Gracefully
he PUSHES through the shield, his hand moving towards Daniel
who stumbles backward as he retreats.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 320

O'Neil rushes into the room, looking around for Daniel. He
SEES a puddle of blood on the floor, leading over to the
medallion, Sari's torn cloth laying next to it. O'Neil
believes Daniel is lost. Suddenly O'Neil SEES something
across the room.

O'NEIL'S P.O.V. - SILVER TRAY 321

At the side of the room, the silver tray with the soldiers
equipment and the DISMANTLED BOMB.

His opportunity before him, O'Neil is torn; complete his
mission and re-assemble the bomb or wait for the others. He
doesn't know what to do.

INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME 322

Daniel is backing away as Ra keeps moving towards him,
unrelenting. As Daniel retreats he looks down and SEES...

DANIEL'S P.0.V. - SHIELD POWER SOURCE 323

At Ra's feet Daniel sees four small pyramids which float an
inch above the ground, creating the shield. The floor is
exposed. Daniel gets an idea.

DANIEL
(subtitled)
Please, don't hurt her. Please.

Suddenly Daniel drops down, bowing before Ra.

RA
(subtitled)
Too late for that.

Daniel peeks up from the floor just in time to SEE Ra walk
across the thin fabric which hangs down from the walls.

Ra's feet crush over the fine cloth as he steps over, clearly
the shield does not cover the ground.

Seizing the moment, Daniel quickly GRABS at the fabric and
RUNS towards the sarcophagus. As he MOVES the fabric WRAPS
around Ra's ankles. As Ra spins to follow, he trips up. He
and his shield TUMBLE to the floor.

Daniel leaps to his feet. He races to Sari's side, lifting
her out of the sarcophagus and rushing out of the room.

Through the rippling waves of his shield we SEE Ra, seething
with anger. Slowly he gets back to his feet.

EXT. PYRAMID - SAME 324
The numbers of the Shepherd boys are dwindling from the

intense BOMBING from the remaining three Gliders. As another
Glider makes a PASS, again Kawalsky leads the boys to FIRE.

Suddenly, Skaara runs out of ammunition. Quickly, weapons
begin to CLICK, empty all around him.

Slowly Kawalsky and Feretti run out of ammunition as well.
The Glider passes over and BLASTS into the barricade.

Several other Shepherd boys are injured.

KAWALSKY
Damn it!

THE GLIDERS 325
break formation, banking away from the fortification. At

first they're hopeful that the battle is over. They are

quickly deflated when they SEE...

Not too far away, the Gliders LAND on the dunes.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 326

Just as O'Neil kneels down next to the dismantled bomb, Anubis
appears at the doorway.

Anubis COCKS the weapon open. Just as he FIRES, O'Neil LIFTS
the silver platter, using it as a SHIELD. It DEFLECTS the
power burst, bending it in half.

O'Neil FLINGS the tray at Anubis and CHARGES, SLAMMING him
against the wall, his weapon dropping.

Locked in mortal combat, the two warriors struggle.
EXT. DUNES - SKAARA AND SHEPHERD BOYS 327

The Gliders have landed on top of the dunes. One of the
Guards, YELLS OUT, commanding a surrender.

Slowly some of the Shepherd boys climb out from behind the
toppled carts, throwing their weapons aside. Skaara tries
to stop them as they leave.

Even Feretti bows his head in defeat as Kawalsky chucks his
weapon away in frustration.

INT. THRONE ROOM - SAME 328
Sari in his arms, Daniel rushes across the room over to the
medallion. Frightened, Daniel searches for some way to turn

it on. As Daniel looks up he SEES...

RA 329

Marching straight towards Daniel and Sari. Coming closer,
closer...

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 330
O'Neil and Anubis are locked in mortal combat. Anubis with

the upper hand gets on top of O'Neil, pummeling him with
savage blows to the head. O'Neil, pinned.

INT. THRONE ROOM - MEDALLION SECTION - SAME 331

Ra has reached Daniel and Sari. Slowly he LIFTS his hand
and PUSHES through his shield, exposing it to Daniel. He
moves his hand close to Daniel's head.

RA
(subtitled)
I am no longer amused.

Behind him we SEE the children arrive, watching helplessly.
INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 332

Anubis swings, O'Neil catching his hand. Suddenly he MONKEY
FLIPS Anubis OVER his head, sending him sprawling. Anubis
rolls to a stop at the edge of the Medallion, his HEAD landing
ONTO THE MEDALLION'S SURFACE.

O'Neil LEAPS on top of him, pinning him down. Anubis grabs
for his weapon. O'Neil SLAMS Anubis' arm back to the floor.

As Anubis' wrist device hits the floor, the medallion suddenly
ACTIVATES, the laser beginning to form the cylinder.

O'Neil is shocked. Realizing, he holds Anubis down.
INT. RA'S CRAFT - MEDALLION ROOM - SAME 333

Ra lifts his hand above Daniel. His head begins to DISTORT,
particles SHIFTING. Daniel SCREAMS OUT in agony. Suddenly
the LASER begins to form the cylinder around the medallion.

Through his pain, Daniel SEES this and GRABS RA'S WRIST.
With his foot against the base of Ra's shield, he keeps Ra
off the medallion while holding his arm inside.

With every bit of strength Daniel can gather, he holds tight
through his torture. The laser encircles the medallion,
sealing.

Unable to pull free, RA'S HAND IS CAUGHT IN THE CYLINDER.
His eyes go wide with panic. Suddenly the BEAM ACTIVATES.
Ra SCREAMS OUT as his hand is severed.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 334
O'Neil's eyes go wide as he SEES... The cylinder SEALS UP,
SEVERING ANUBIS' HEAD. O'Neil jumps back away from the

headless body.

INT. RA'S CRAFT - MEDALLION ROOM SAME 335
Daniel looks up at the shocked Ra as he, Sari and RA'S HAND

are BEAMED downward. Just as they disappear, the HEAD OF
ANUBIS, arrives in their place. Ra can't believe his eyes.

them to come. Frightened, they back away from him.
Furious, Ra STORMS past them, clutching at his wrist.
INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME

O'Neil looks over to see the unconscious Daniel and Sari
laying on the medallion.

EXT. DUNES - SKAARA GUARDS - SUNSET

As the three guards approach, weapons aimed, Skaara turns to
Kawalsky for help. Kawalsky knows all is lost and raises
his hands in surrender. Feretti does the same. The boys,
reluctantly follow their lead.

Slowly they come out from behind their barricade,
surrendering.

ANGLE - DUNES - GUARDS AND SHEPHERD BOYS

Just as they are about to reach the Guards, a LONE CRY is
heard off in the distance.

The Guards look around when suddenly Kasuf APPEARS at the
top of the dunes. He lifts his arms and SCREAMS OUT a
COMMAND. Suddenly...

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

Appearing at the top of every dune. The Guards turn just as
Kasuf SCREAMS OUT a BATTLE CRY.

Rushing over the dunes, from every direction, all the workers
and townspeople run towards the Guards, SCREAMING OUT.

KASUF

leads the CHARGE. With primitive TOOLS, MINING EQUIPMENT
and make-shift weapons, the people ATTACK.

The Guards FIRE, killing several but they are TOTALLY

OUTNUMBERED. Before they can escape they are OVERRUN, MOBBED.

INT. SARCOPHAGUS ROOM - SAME

Shivering with PAIN, Ra moves to his sarcophagus. Suddenly
the SOUND of THOUSANDS OF VOICES draws his attention. He
moves over to a window behind the sarcophagus and SEES...

RA'S P.O.V. - OUT WINDOW - BATTLE BELOW
His guards overrun, a riotous mob outside. Stunned, Ra can't

believe what he's seeing. Furious he makes his way over to
the many PEDESTALS.

Suddenly the entire CRAFT begins to RUMBLE, coming to life.

EXT. PYRAMID KASUF AND SKAARA SUNSET 343
In the center of the chaos, Skaara stops, listening. Soon

the RUMBLE grows LOUD. Slowly everyone STOPS, turning towards
the pyramid.

Kawalsky and Feretti, also freeze, looking upwards.
Astonished they hold back their triumph as they SEE...

PYRAMID AND CRAFT - SUNSET 344

The craft begins to FOLD UP, preparing for the launch, BLASTS
of AIR shooting from the sides.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 345
Daniel is unconscious, Sari is not much better. As she

cradles him in her arms the room suddenly begins to SHAKE.

O'Neil gets up and bolts for the NUCLEAR DEVICE.

Quickly O'Neil begins to assemble it.

EXT. PYRAMID - SUNSET 346
Ra's Space Craft begins to LIFT OFF. The HARSH WINDS BLOWING.
Slowly the CRAFT leaves the pyramid, sailing upwards into

the sky.

ANGLE - KAWALSKY, SKAARA AND FERETTI 347

Seeing the craft retreating, they CHEER, the harsh winds
kicking up the sand.

INT. STARGATE ROOM - SAME 348

Daniel begins to wake in the violent shaking of the room.
Through his haziness he SEES O'Neil putting the bomb back
together.

DANIEL
No.

With all his energy, Daniel pulls himself up, moving closer
to O'Neil.

DANIEL (CONT'D)
No! We won! He's leaving!

O'Neil CLICKS the last part of the bomb in place. A RED
LIGHT turns ON at the top of the device, a COUNTER starts
CLICKING DOWN. Slowly O'Neil turns back to Daniel.
117.

O'NEIL
And he won't be coming back.

349 INT. RA'S CHAMBER - SAME 349

His wrist wrapped in his robe, Ra has finished the takeoff
sequence. His eyes filled with tears of humiliation, Ra
YELLS out to the children but they do not come. Frustrated,
Ra moves to the edge of the doorway and CALLS OUT to the
children.

He turns and SEES the children have gathered onto the
medallion, huddled close, fear in their eyes. Angrily, Ra
yells over to them.

RA
(betrayed; subtitled)
You can not leave me!
Suddenly the medallion ACTIVATES, the children begin to
disappear. Ra SCREAMS OUT with anger and betrayal. The
children vanish. In their place Ra SEES...
350 THE NUCLEAR DEVICE 350

Sitting on top of the medallion is THE NUCLEAR DEVICE.

The digital clock on its side reads: 6... 5... 4 Ra's eyes
go wide.
351 EXT. PYRAMID - SUNSET 351

The Shepherd boys LOOK UP to the sky just as the craft
DISAPPEARS, out of the stratosphere. At the point of
disappearance, the craft is replaced with a BRILLIANT FLASH
OF WHITE LIGHT. Suddenly the sky IGNITES with COLORS.

The ROAR of a NUCLEAR EXPLOSION.
352 ANGLE - PYRAMID ENTRANCE 352
Daniel, O'Neil and Sari emerge from the pyramid. From the
top of the stairs they watch the most amazing light show
ever.

O'Neil and Daniel share a smile.

squinting as they walk out into the daylight.

353 ANGLE - SKAARA AND SHEPHERD BOYS 353

O'Neil stands to attention. Finally he proudly lifts his

hand and returns the gesture. Kawalsky and Feretti share a
smile.

ANGLE - PEOPLE 354
Below them THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE surround the base of the ramp.
ANGLE - ENTRANCE PLATFORM 355
Daniel, O'Neil, Sari, Skaara and Kasuf turn towards the masses

the air.

A THOUSAND FISTS 356

All at once a THOUSAND FISTS are RAISED with a loud CHEER,
THE BATTLE CRY repeated. Daniel is overwhelmed with emotion.

THE MASTADGE 357

Pushing through the crowd, the Mastadge ROARS OUT to Daniel.
Daniel laughs, turns to Sari and HUGS HER TIGHT.

WIDER SHOT OF SURROUNDING AREA 358

All the Shepherd boys, their arms lifted above their heads.
The CHEER CONTINUES as we pull back wider and wider.

Feretti, Kawalsky and O'Neil prepare to enter the gate.
Skaara and Daniel move close. O'Neil holds his hand out for
Skaara. Skaara stares at the hand for a beat. Slowly he
reaches out and shakes hands with O'Neil.
FERETTI
(to Daniel)

I always knew you'd get us back.

Daniel smiles as Kawalsky laughs.

KAWALSKY
You sure you wanna do this?
119.
DANIEL
They need me right now. I've got to
stay.

Daniel nods. O'Neil moves over to Daniel, shakes his hand.
There's an awkward pause.

O'NEIL
You gonna be alright?

DANIEL
I'll be fine. You?

O'NEIL
Yeah. I think so.

Daniel reaches over and hands something to O'Neil. He looks
down and sees the GOLDEN SUN DISK in his hand.

DANIEL
Tell Catherine it brought me luck.

O'NEIL
I will.

O'Neil turns and joins his men as they STEP THROUGH THE GATE,
disappearing. Skaara waving goodbye as they go.
