O'Doul, unconscious, is stretched out under
blankets on his cot. On a second cot across
tent, Elliott, fully dressed, relaxes, He
draw his hand back and forth across his
forehead, Apparently he is not well.

O'Doul stirs, mumbles unintelligibly, Elliott
gets up, goes to table, picks up cup of berry
juice and crosses to O'Doul with it. .

Elliott puts his hand on O'Doul's head, then
tries his pulse,

Elliott (finally - to O'Doul, still
unconscious)
Well, your fever's broken, Dennis, I don't think
you heed any more medicing for a while,

Elliott puts cup of juice back on table and
returns weakly to cot, Baroni and Medford
enter,

Elliott (looks them over)
I'm glad you've come, gentlemen.

for support)
Well, I'm sure of one thing, - I'm sure he'll know
how to deal with you.

He is weaker - he sits down on cot again,

There is silence as Baroni and Medford
watch Elliott. Elliott's head drops as
if he were going to pass out.

After a moment, Elliott looks up at the

two men, senses their attitude of triumph,
He tries to get up to reach the cup of juice
on the table and he cannot make it. Medford
reaches for cup to give to him, Baroni stays
