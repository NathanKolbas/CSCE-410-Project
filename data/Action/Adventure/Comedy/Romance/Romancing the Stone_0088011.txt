A size 16-EE boot kicks through the door, ripping the old
board from the wall.

ANGELINA 2
in lacy camisole, doeskin skirt, boots whirls from an old stove.
GROGAN 3

fills the doorway, a dark hulk against the dazzling light

‘ outside. He cocks his shotgun.

Flies BUZZ, hides hanging from the beams, something SIMMERS in
the pot over the fire, TUMBLING RIVER WATERS are heard in the
distance. All else is still. It is 1875.

A cigarette dangles from Grogan's lips.

GROGAN
What's it gonna be, Angelina?

ANGELINA
(voice over; after a
pause}
It seemed endless. I was sure
I had lost him at the river, in
the winter of ‘Seventy-four.’

Shotgun aimed at her breast, he takes a step inside.
ANGELINA 4
Angelina surreptitiously slides a boot dagger from its sheath.

GROGAN
You can die two ways, angel.
Quick like the tongue of the
snake, or slower than the
molasses in January.

ANGELINA
(voice over)
When I told him it was October --

GROGAN

T'll kill ya if it was the goddamn
Fourth of July. Where is it?

His eyes Gart about the room, lock onto the saidlebags on the
bunk. He moves that way.

With one graceful movement, Angelina grabs the dagger's ti
and flips it underneand. & silver flash streaks through the
air and Grogan falls, back out the door, deader than yesterday.

Angelina throws on a doeskin poncho and snatches up the
saddlebags.

ANGELINA

That was the end of Grogan, the
man who killed my father, raped
and murdered my sister, burned
my ranch, shot my dog...

Stealing the shotgun off Grogan, Angelina cocks the weapon,
and scans thé area. Her horse is tethered near Grogan's.

ANGELINA

He had come alone. But if there
was one law in the West...

Four bad-asses, THE BROTHERS, in matching ankle-length coats,
thunder toward her on matching stallions. ‘They simultaneously

Four of Jesse's crack shots spin a revolver high in the x

PULL BACK TO REVEAL JOAN CHARLES 15

Surrounded by globes, books, maps tackec to rulletin x
boards, a stack of mail marked "Elaine," she pauses for a

cup of coffee. A woman who has never developed any confidence
in herself. She turns back to her work as the DOORBELL
BUZZES: She hesitates, checks her calendar. No appointments.
All very puzzling. Again the BELL 8UZZES.

INT. LIVING ROOM 16

Moving to the intercom, Joan passes her Exercycle, and
the framed cover of her previous novels: "The Ravagers",
"The Return of Angelina", etc.

Again the BUZZER sounds, twice, fast. Joan slows, pauses,
finally depresses the speaker button.

JOAN
Hello?

ZOLO
(voice over; in a
thick accent)
Joan Charles?

JOAN
Yes?

Zolo coughs.

The continued SILENCE is unsettling, even eerie. Joan crosses
to the street window, peers down.

SOAN'S .P.0.V. 17

Three stories down, we CATCH A GLIMPSE of a LARGE MAN climbing
into a taxi, an ominous figure in a dark overcoat and avaitor
shades.

But Joan's eyes see something else: A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously
. very much in love, walking arm in arm, bundled up against the
cold New York winter.

ANGLE ON JOAN 18

The wistful look on her face tells us how much Joan wishes
to be "arm in arm", and the rueful shake of her head indicates
how little hope she has that that wish will come true.

Joan lets the curtain fall back. (Near her is a photograph
of herself and her older sister, Elaine. Elaine standing in
the =.g. big smile on her face, while Joan behind is almost
cowering, afraid of the camera.)

Joan again peeks out the window, then, with renewed _.
determination, she returns to her typewriter.

EXT. JOAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Joan walks hurriedly, tries hailing a cab, but it goes right
by her. Pausing, she notices up ahead some tough-lociing
punk types lingering around a lamp post. She decides to
cross the street rather than go directly past them.

cuT TO:
EXT. BRENTANO'S BOOKSTORE - DAY , 20-A

An Editor, RICHARD, attractive in an intellectual way; ané

a Junior Editor, CAROLYN, scan pedestrians. Behind them a

big poster announces Joan's newest book, “Angelina's Savage Secret
-- with an added notice taped across it: “Joan Charles, Today.”
They see Joan climbing out of a cab a little up the street,

rush to meet her.

RICHARD
Joan, come on, you're late --
people are waiting.

JOAN
Richard, please, I'm nervous
enough. I'm not going to have
to speak, am I?

/ RICHARD

You don't have to speak, it's a
simple book-signing session.
Besides, this crowd is interested
in Angelina, not in you.

JOAN .
Crowd -- what crowd? You said
it was a simple book-signing
session.

RICHARD
For God's sake, Joan, it's ten
o'clock on a weekday morning,
how many people can there be?

And he practically shoves Joan through the bookstore door --
where at least eight billion HOUSEWIVES are waiting for
her.

RICHARD

Anyway, have a nice evening.

JOAN

two clean cups in it.

CAROLYN
Why do you subject yourselz to
types like that? You could do
so much better.

JOAN
Yeah -- in what other life?

She sighs, looking over the way the last fan left.

A woman just said my books saved

CAROLYN
Well, where else will men keep

A few children out here play the Columbian equivalent of
Jacks. A frail YOUNG BOY, 10, practices with a bola by
the fountain across the way.

 

The Ferrari jerks to a stop. Elaine jumping out, leaving
the door open, to hurry to close the Villa gates, stealing
nervous glances over her shoulder. She rushes back to the
Ferrari. Just as she gets one fcot inside, the Boy

slings his bola. :

The bola wraps around her neek, one ball Striking her head,
knocking her unconscious. She fails sideways, into the

Racing over, the Boy shoves her across the seat, slides

No owner in sight -- it's a write-off.

Joan, oblivious, just stands there in her New York outfit --
watching the other passengers start to trudge away, back the way
the bus has come.

Before going, a couple of Indians still over at the jeep take
bird cages that still have birds in them.

Joan follows the other passengers’ action -- clearly this is the
kind of occurrence they've dealt with before. She begins to
take her suitcase off the bus.

357 Cont.

They immediately see her as a whistler's cream, start hawking
at her. Head held high, she ignores them walks right past --
hair flowing proudly in the wind.

EXT. HER STREET 358
She walks toward her building. Suddenly she hears a strange
horn, not like any car horn she's ever heard. She looks at
the road beside her -- and steps back with a gasp!

A boat is driving down her street. A big monster of a luxury
dream boat. Actually, it's not driving. Closer inspection
reveals it's being towed. And at the helm...is Jack Colton.

The boat stops alongside her. Jack tosses her a thick
envelope.

JACK
Your half. .

JOAN
(picks it up)
Half! -- Who said you could have half.

“JACK
That's what equal partners take.

And he puts a foot up on the side of the boat to lean over
and grin at her. , .

JOAN
(nodding)
I like the crocodile boots.

JACK :
Yeah, that poor old yellow-stripe
guy developed fatal indigestion,
died in my arms.

JOAN
Can't blame him. If I was going to
die, that'd be the place I'd pick.

JACK
(looking around
New York)
How about you taking me on a tour
for a change.

JOAN

« He reaches down to pull her up to joan him.
JACK
Then we'll come back here and you
ean pack.
JOAN
Pack?
JACK
Isn't it time we got out of the
jungle?
‘Their arms go around each other, they embrace like the world
was just beginnning, and they lock themselves into a kiss
that never ends as:
THE BOAT: : 358-A
Sails away into the sunset of Manhattan, flying Columbian
colors, "El Coraz6n' lettered on its keel.
: ouT 359-

FADE OUT
