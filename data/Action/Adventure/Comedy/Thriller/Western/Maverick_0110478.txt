GAMBLING IS HIS GAME.
SMOOTH AS THE HANDLE OF A GUN,
MAVERICK IS THE NAME.
WILD AS THE WIND IN OREGON.
FLOWING UP A CANYON, EASIER TO TAME.
RIVERBOAT RING YOUR BELL.
FARETHEEWELL, ANNABELLE,

The occasional tree.

Not a place you'd like to spend your summer vacation.
Now there are sounds: A WHIPPING WIND begins to get
LOUDER. And in the distance, but GROWING: THUNDER.
CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE -SLOWLY, INEXORABLY, ACROSS this dead place --- suddenly it STOPS.
We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideouslooking man. One eye looks straight ahead. The other
wanders.
CAMERA MOVES AGAIN.
The wind is really kicking up --- suddenly, another STOP.
Another Leone CLOSEUP.
A second man. This guy makes the first one look
handsome. Both his eyes work, which is an improvement.
But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose.
CAMERA IS MOVING AGAIN.
LOUDER THUNDER.

A storm is coming fast.

CAMERA STOPS.
We are LOOKING AT the least appetizing of the three.

proper working order -- it's just that he's so damn
frightening.

Not to mention huge.
This is THE ANGEL and like the other two, he is seated on
a horse. And he is staring intently at something. FROM

MAVERICK's 30, give or take. Enormously appealing.
Whether that's because of his considerable physical
skills or his sunny personality, who knows. It might
be his quiet wit.
In any case, we are looking at a handsome young man that
everybody likes --- oops --- make that almost everybody.
Because just now he is seated on a horse beneath a tree
and a thick hope has been tied around his neck, the rope
thrown over a branch. His hands have been tied behind
his back. We are about to watch a hanging. His.
THE ANGEL
(riding closer)
I almost got hung myself once,
didn't much care for it, how about
you?
(as Maverick
says nothing)
We're gonna leave now, but I'm
worried about your well-being.
Maverick just stares at him, makes no reply.
THE ANGEL
He gestures for the other two to ride, and they take
off.
THE ANGEL
See, I don't think it's a good
thing for a man to be alone out
here. Your mind can do cruel
things.
And now he takes a burlap sack, tosses it toward
Maverick. It lands nearby.
THE ANGEL
Enjoy the company.
He spurs his horse, rides away.
MAVERICK

took.

River, a ferry coming across the river in the b.g.
MAVERICK (V.O.)
I was heading into Crystal River

Probably I should have expected
bad luck on the horizon when my
horse got stolen and I had to
replace it with something less
than a thoroughbred.

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DUSK

The place is busy enough, the bar doing a brisk business.
A poker game is in session. Half a dozen play. A
cattlehand, a preacher, a small-time local businessman.
But it's the other three we pay most attention to.
First is a very young man. Late teens, looks less.
Thin. Small. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big
meal. This is THE KID. Seems ordinary.
Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not
ordinary, certainly not in these surroundings. She's
elegantly-dressed, close to being beautiful. She's
married, has a deep Southern accent, and hasn't been
poor for a long time. Maybe she's thirty. She seems
a rotten poker player, but a wonderful flirt. This
is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD.
Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already -- he
tossed the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just
before the hanging. Huge, powerful, not much makes him
smile, except winning at cards.
There is an empty seat at the table.
STAIRCASE
as Maverick descends. If before he was grimy from
travel, he isn't anymore. He wears a black hat, a black
jacket, a black string tie --- and just the most beautiful white lace shirt you ever
saw.

(We know that within a week,
But they haven't met before.)

THE ANGEL
I like the game the way it is.
MAVERICK
I bring all kinds of plusses to
the table. I hardly ever bluff and
I never ever cheat.
THE ANGEL
I don't believe it.
MAVERICK
Neither do I.
THE ANGEL
(voice rising, not
in pitch, but
intensity)
I like the game just the way it
is.
MAVERICK
Bet I can change your mind.
(beat)
I promise to lose for at least
an hour.
THE ANGEL
(without a pause)
We're playing five card draw.
As Maverick sits -MAVERICK
losing a hand to The Angel.

The Angel smiles --

-- but so does Maverick.
MAVERICK
losing again, this time to Annabelle.

She's happy --

-- but again, so is Maverick.
And now we begin a SERIES of VERY QUICK CUTS.
Of The kid, holding his cards.

Tightly.

Of the cattleman casually making a bet.

Very casually.

Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much
attention.
He loses again, smiles.
Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting.
For a long beat.
And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips.
The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy.
The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked. She
flicks her fingernails against her front teeth, makes a
bet.
The businessman is toying with his necktie.
The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the
bottom, then repeating, the top to the bottom.
And Maverick loses again, smiles again, just happy to
be there.
Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling, staring at
what she's been dealt.
The Angel is smiling happily.

He rakes in a pot.

The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table.
The Kid's hand covers his mouth.
The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players
or the pot.
Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe she's not such a
rotten poker player after all.
Maverick tosses in his cards. Another loss. He smiles,
glances at the clock on the wall -- an hour and a half
have gone by.

He looks at his winning hand almost in surprise. It's a

THE KID

Don't think...
The rest is unintelligible.
MAVERICK
Didn't get you.
THE KID
I said I don't think that hand
should count.
MAVERICK
You got any logical reasons going
for you?
THE KID
My mind wasn't on the game.
His voice is always soft.
CLOSEUP - THE KID
He stares at Maverick and something is suddenly clear:
His eyes are deadly.
MAVERICK

Take whatever you think's yours,
I'll be content with the leavings.
As The Kid does -ANNABELLE
A quick look of disappointment crosses her face.
THE ANGEL
A look of contempt crosses his.
THE ANGEL
You always been gutless?
MAVERICK
(thinks a minute -then nods)
I think so. At least for as long
as I can remember. My pappy
always said, 'He who fights and
runs away, can run away another
day.'
(now he stands -like every other
man in the room, he
wears a six gun)
Here's the truth -- I don't see
what's so great about being brave.
Pulls back his black jacket, clearing his gun.

fact is, if I'd faced you down,
what chance would I have had?
Answer? Zero.
MAVERICK
suddenly he draws -- and it's lightning -- you never saw
anyone so fast.
THE KID
Stunned.
MAVERICK
His voice casual.
MAVERICK
No chance whatsoever.
And now he expertly twirls his gun back into its
holster.
ANNABELLE
Leaning toward The Kid.
ANNABELLE
Was that fast?
(as The Kid manages
a nod)
I thought it was fast.
MAVERICK
sitting back down at the table again. This has all gone
quickly and quietly. Now he looks at The Kid.
MAVERICK
May I suggest that from now on
you keep your mind on the game?
THE KID
Yes.

Yessir.

How come, when you lose all the
time?
MAVERICK
Oh, I don't lose all the time -just the first hour or so. I like
for people to be happy.
THE ANGEL
What happens after that?
MAVERICK
Probably I'll win all your money.
THE ANGEL
Aren't you a little overconfident?
MAVERICK
No. I've just been here before.
POKER GAME BEGINNING AGAIN
And again, we see a SERIES OF VERY QUICK CUTS.
In fact, we see many of the same cuts we saw before -only this time, Maverick doesn't lose, he wins.
The Kid holds his cards tightly. Too tightly. He makes
a bet. Maverick doubles it. The Kid folds. He was
bluffing.
The Cattleman casually makes a bet. Very casually.
Maverick doubles it. Another bluff. Maverick wins again.
Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling.

Maverick has cleaned out everybody but The Angel.
The Angel hesitates, moving the top card to the bottom,
does it again, moves the top card to the bottom --- now he makes a bet.
Now Maverick makes a bet.

He is raw-boned, blue-eyed, muscle and sinew; rugged as
they come. There is also something about him we don't
know yet but we will: Coop is so good, so fucking
honorable, he seems like someone out of another era --- which in point of fact, he is. Coop is the western

gun you ever saw. It is what blasted the tree branch to

The sound STOPS.

Coop draws his GUN, COCKS it -- it makes a distinct
sound --- KUH -- LICK --- he stares out into the darkness, ready for anything.
Then he relaxes, puts the gun back into its holster.

The Coomodore.

He moves to the fire.

I had to say good-bye. I couldn't

Made sure nobody was following me.
You don't seem happy to see me.

What did Maverick say to that
sweet young thing? 'You never want
to give everything away.' If
Angel'd won, we'd still have split
it the same way. I telegraphed him
-- keep Maverick from the game. He
messed that up. Poor dead bastard.
COOP
I just don't like secrets.
THE COMMODORE
Then you probably won't like this
one either.
THE COMMODORE
as suddenly he draws his gun, cocks it --- there's that sound again --- KUH -- LICK --- and the GUN is aimed at Coop's heart.
THE COMMODORE
I guess it's just my greedy nature.
But I've decided not to share it
with you -COOP

A deal's a deal.

In a perfect world, that's true.

MAVERICK
Sit down, gentlemen. Let's get
cozy. Have a parley. Put your
hands down. You look ridiculous.
I almost fell asleep with boredom
following you -- you and that
idiot speech about my wisdom -how could you expect me to fall
for that? You must think I'm
awful damn dumb.
(to Coop)
But you... you fooled me. And
not many can. But you saved me,
so I won't kill you.

Just remember, the whole world
knows what you are. That's
punishment enough. All your
life's work, all the good you
did, you wiped it away. You don't
have anything to show for it.

You're young, so you don't know
that much about mistakes, but
you're making one now.

You can't leave me alive.

His hands fiddle a little with the gun, we can't really

Commodore, as if to shoot him, then, at the last minute
he flicks the GUN to the side and SHOOTS. The bullet
just misses the Commodore and scares him very badly.
