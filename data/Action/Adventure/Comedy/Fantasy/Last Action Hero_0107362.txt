THE LAST ACTION HERO

by
Zak Penn and Adam Leff

The spirit that I have seen

May be the devil, and the devil hath power
T’assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
Out of my weaxness and melancholy,

Abuses me to damn me.

INT. THE BEVERLY CENTER 

Saturday: The Mall is glutted with L.A. shoppers; sleek,
aerodynamic women, smiley men in flower ties.

On all four floors: A swirling eddy of sun-glasses, Day-Glo,
surfwear and sushi.

THREE QUICK SHOTS

of THREE ARYAN MERCENARIES, dressed ‘inconspicuously’ in
sunglasses and dark grey business suits, doing their best to
lock like average shoppers: .

MERC 1 scans the Hot Hit C.5.‘s at Sam Goody.
MERC 2 tests out the zippers on garment bags at La Valise.

MERC 3 stares down a fuzzy, little puppy in the pet shop
window.

THEN, simultaneously, all three of their stop watches sound
off. They drop what they’re doing, walk out of the stores,
and in steady, controlled strides converge at the ELEVATOR
BANK. . .

These are some well-trained, bad-ass, tougher-than-hell hit
men. :

GLASS ELEVATORS --

DING, and the elevator doors swoosh open. The MERCS file in,
and line up across the back. They are the only ones in the
elevator other than the LIFT OPERATOR, who announces the
floors,
OPERATOR
Fourth floor...Bullocks, Sporting
Goods, Designer Fashions...

As the elevator ascends, the MERCS prepare: One loads his gun,
another twists on a silencer, the third checks his watch,
right on schedule.

The OPERATOR looks nervous, but tries to get on with his job.

OPERATOR
Fifth Floor...Cineplex, food court,
rest rooms.

The MERCS straighten their ties and prepare to step off.

Sixth Floor..
The elevator doors slide open and...Holy $ hit, your pancreas
@ances, because who's standing right in ‘the middle of the
dcorway but...

ARNO SLATER, the toughest, strongest, hardest-to-kill, Action
Hero you’ve ever seen.

OPERATOR
..-Last stop...

ARNO
Everybody out!

Before the MERCS can so much as blink, ARNO’S massive assault
rifle BLASTS them in one glass shattering boon | through the
back of the elevator. .

They PLUMMET, head over heels, two-hundred feet through the
air, racking up in the shallow fountain below. :

THEN -~

From all corners of the mall, THE BACK-UP TEAM, fifteen more
MERCS in identical dark grey suits, put down their newspapers,
get up from their benches, and rapidly converge en Arno‘s
position.

These MERCS just saw their friends swan dive 200 feet into the
wishing pool, and they look plenty pissed. They come
together, forming an impassable line, and sweep forward,
violently pushing all shoppers out of their way.

As they get closer to Target~Point-Arno, right in the middle
of the crowd, they open fire. All hell breaks loose in the
mall, and the pulse pounding SOUND TRACK kicks into overdrive.

Arno barrels through the mall-ways towards the escalators on
the other side. Here, the oblivious crowd shuffles on
undisturbed.

He takes a breath, and checks his gun. It’s a beauty: A blue
steel, state-of-the-art hand cannon, with one of those high~

Two escalators, One Up, one DOWN, run right alongside each
other. Men closing in fast behind him, ARNO hops on to the
UP escalator.

On the floor above, one mean looking MERC heading right for
him, and the only thing in between them... ~*

A weary MOTHER pushing her CHILD in a stroller towards the
Down escalator. And...Uh, oh...The child’s safety strap hangs
unbuckled...

Arno flips on his laser sighting, just as the MERC comes
bounding forward, and THWACK... By accident, crashes into the
stroller, pitching the smiling child into space.

The mother screams, the MERC aims, the child falls and the
MERC fires at ARNO...

WHO ducks the bullet, then pivots, and with his giant right
HAND reaches out and CATCHES the child, while his ieft raises
his gun, laser sights his quarry and blows him away.

Arno then rides up the escalator and gently hands the child
off to the weeping, grateful mother as she passes going DOWN.

ARNO
(dead~pan)
Shopping can be hell. .
Arno gets off the escalator, but his work isn’t over yet.

Charging down the FOOD COURT in front of him are a band of
FOUR more MERCS in matching grey suits.

They’ve seen him. Moving back into the crowd, Arno spots a
clothing store, VICTORIA’S SECRET

ar &

INT, VICTORIA‘S SECRET -~

An army of beach beauties flows back and forth draped in silk
negligees, examining their perfect construction before the
wall length mirrors.

All activity ceases, however, when ARNO strides into the
center of the store.

i decides to deal with hin.

 

SALESWOMAN
Can I help you, sir?

. ARNO
No, I’m just looking.

. SALESWOMAN
I see.

Qut of the corner of his eye, Arno spots ‘the MERCS coming his
way.

ARNO
Is there a back door here?

SALESWOMAN
Well, it’s through the changing roon,
but I’m afraid that’s for customers
only...
Arno grabs a giant RED BRA off the rack.

ARNO
This is nice, I’ll be right back.

SALESWOMAN
Hey!

CHANGING ROOM --

Arno bursts into a dressing room filled with half-naked women
trying on silky panties.

A BUXOM BLONDE with huge jugs screams at the top of her lungs.
Arno tosses her the BRA.

ARNO
Here, try this.

Arno charges down a hall to.a large steel door marked,
‘EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY’ Without a thought, he crashes it open
and finds himself right in...

The most unbelievably mammoth PARKING LOT you’ve ever seen.

INT. PARKING LOT --
of the staircase reads...

 

"UNVALIDATED TICKET PAYS MAXIMUM PENALTY"
SFX - FOOTSTEPS
An unfortunate MERC pops through the doorway. In an instant,
the red laser dot from ARNO’s Beretta stcsps right in the
middle of his forehead.
ARNO
You forgot your validation...

He blows him away.

ARNO takes off down the center aisle of the parking lot. Then
he stops.

ARNO’S P.O.V. =

About FIFTEEN of the MERCS have followed him in, and are
coming down the exit ramp, straight towards him.

Using the cars as cover, Arno makes his way to the edge of the
parking structure and peers over the side...

It’s about a hundred foot drop. Into traffic.
and it’s rush hour.

Arno realizes he must stand and fight, when SUDDENLY, a hail
of bullets come flying past him.

He ducks behind a Mercedes, and clicks on his LASER SCOPE.
The thin, piercing beam of the laser sight streams out and
bounces off the car window.
An electronic VOICE blares out:
CAR ALARM VOICE

You are standing too close to this

car! You have ten seconds to move

away...

The Laser Dot accidentally triggered the car alarm, and it’s
scared ARNO out of his shorts.

NOW, the MERCS know where he is, and they’re coming fast.

hing hard in one pocket and pulis-it out.

It’s a pack of gum.

Arno’s sweating. The Mercs are fanning out in ali directions.
All he can see is an infinite sea of cars, and, somewhere, a
million miles away, a tiny glowing exit sign.

And then it hits him. The cars, all of them. After all, this
is L.A....

ARNO smiles.

He shoves the two pieces of gum in his mouth and starts moving
from car to car.

He plucks the wad of gum out of his mouth and separates it
into two smail balls. He jams them in his ears.

ARNO: lifts the gun up, the LASER flickering past his face, and
then, in a series of sweeping motions...

FANS THE LASER BEAM BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE PARKING LOT --

The red laserlight dances all over the immense lot, bouncing -

off car windows and mirrors, an intricate latticework shifting
and tilting with his hand.

THE MERCS are confused, some of them scared by the light
passing over then. :

There's a dazzling sea of little red blips, followed by an
incredibly tense moment of silence, you could almost hear a
pin drop when...

BLAMMO!

SFX -= The most unbelievable, ear~shattering, Earth-ending
cacophony of CAR ALARMS and warning systems blasts out all
over the lot.

It’s sonic=boom time, and ARNO‘’S ready for it, dashing through
the lot as fast as he can, a big shit-eating grin on his face.

THE MERCS look like they’ve just spent a week in an Iraqi
Bunker. They clutch their ears, falling te the floor in
clumps.

ExT.

arno Slater has beaten the odds once again. He runs straight
through the exit door and down the ramp. so

A BROWN SEDAN pulls right up next to him -- an amazingly hot
BABE behind the wheel.

ARNO gives her his sexy, sly smile, and she glances down at
his sweaty pumping muscles.

He hops in next to her; she revs the engine, and...
HE TURNS TO THE AUDIENCE. And winks.

As they roar off down the ramp, two huge, metallic words slide
across the screen and smash together:

Hey, Les...
The theater is almost empty. A few homeless people sleep in
seats near the back.

SUDDENLY, the back doors to the theater fling open and the
lights blaze on. Through the doors at the end of the long

The Projectionist starts walking back and forth, parallel to

He grips Danny by the shoulders and leads him, back and forth,
staring at the screen.

DANNY'S P.O.V. --

As he passes a certain point on the screen, a beam of light
shoots out, disappearing just as quickly when he passes away
from it.

DANNY
What is that?

The Projectionist reaches out. His hand seens to disappear
into the screen. 8

...The world of NEW YORK’S TIMES SQUARE.
It’s one of those hot summer nights in the city when the wind
feels like subway backdraft flying up in your face.

On these blocks the action never stops. Everyone is selling
something: Smokes, chicks, chains, incense, and I.D.‘s, and
every gambler, creep, and junkie in the city wants a part of
it.

Danny makes his way through the threatening gauntlet of crack
fiend solicitors. He’s not exactly at ease with the
situation, but at least somewhat used to it.

He finally reaches the UPTOWN subway entrance, and descends
the stairs into the dark station below. -

HUNTER HIGH SCHOOL +=

A big, ugly red brick building that looks more like an armory.
INT. HUNTER --

Danny walks down a long, sterile, hallway. He comes to a
door, pushes it open...

CLASSROOM -

Class is already well under way. In the front of the room,
a TEACHER (young, bearded, energetic) lectures on Hamlet.
Behind him is a large blackboard, and a white pull down movie
screen stretching almost to the floor.

Danny sits down at a desk in the back row.

‘ TEACHER
-» And so despite his inability to

il
‘@

act, Hamlet is a kind of inspiration.
He is imaginative, thoughtful,
introspecti e...And most of all, he
can lauch at himself sees

Danny yawns and mechanically takes out a pen and a notebook.

TEACHER
(noticing the bored class)
But I think you‘ll see this in the
clip, so why don’t we just roll it...

Danny perks up. The lights go down.

(cont.)
Alright, this is Laurence Olivier’s
version. Some of you might remember

him from Clash of the Titans.
The clip from HAMLET begins rolling.
ONSCREEN -=-

KING CLAUDIUS kneels before the altar, offering his confession
to God.

CLAUDIUS
What if this cursed hand Were thicker
than itself with brothers’ blood? Is
there not rain enough in the sweet
heavens to wash it white as snow?

suddenly, SIR LAURENCE, as HAMLET, steals into the chapel.
BACK ON DANNY --

He sits up here, paying rapt attention, waiting to see what
Hamlet will do...

ONSCREEN -—

CLAUDIUS
O wretched state! O bosom black as
death! Help, angels! Make assay!

Claudius falls to his knees.

HAMLET
Now might I do it pat, now ‘a is a
prayin, and now I‘ll do it - and so

he goes to heaven, And so am i

revenged.
BACK ON DANNY --

Still somewhat interested, but growing tired of Hamlet’s

speech.
ONSCREEN -~
HAMLET
That would be scanned. A Villain
kills my father, and for that, I, his
sole son, do the same villain send To

Heaven. Why this is hire and salary,
not revenge.

BACK ON DANNY -~

Disappointed. Hamlet’s not gonna do it. He’s gonna talk
about doing it, but he’s not gonna do it.

PULL IN closer and closer on Danny’s eyes as they glaze over
and...

SUDDENLY -~-

We are back in ELSINORE. CLAUDIUS prays at the altar, as
Hamlet steals up behind him.

Hamlet, however, looks a little different. He’s got the black
turtleneck, the gold medallion, but his back, his shoulders...

They’re huge. :

As the strange looking Hamlet emerges from the darkness we
realize, this isn’t Lord Olivier at all, but ARNO SLATER. And
he looks pissed.

Claudius, you killed my father...

The kicking EXTREMELY VIOLENT soundtrack blasts out deafening
metal chords...

Shots of Arno, naked from the waist up, in ‘camo paint and full
combat gear, running through the brooding, moody castle of
Elsinore:

-- blowing away POLONIUS behind the curtain with a machine
gun.

-- pretending to brood in the graveyard with YORICK’S skull,
then spinning around and chucking it at an approaching guard.

-- Wiring castle Elsinore with plastique explosive, and then
blowing it up...

The explosion fades cut...

in their satin jackets and five-finger rings. This isn’t

exactly the type of place where you’d expect to find a fifteen
year-old white boy with a smile on his face.

DANNY has racked up a huge tally, and the Video Screen flashes
on te its Ten Second Musical Interlude Phase before climbing
up to the next level. .

A BIGGER KID, a couple of years older than Danny, comes over
to the video machine. His eyes are only half open, and he
looks pretty drugged out.

The game starts up again, and Danny gets back into it, jamming
away at the controls. The kid just stands there, right over
his shoulder, staring at him for a few seconds. Then he
mumbles something angrily, and saunters over to another game.
Danny looks relieved, as he watches the kid walk away.

BACK ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -

The game gets harder and harder. The Villain lands @ series
of devastating body blows and finally Danny’s guy is backed
into a corner, roundhoused, and dogged. The screen starts
flashing, “INSERT COIN" over and over again.

As the game ends, Danny straightens up and takes his roll of
quarters off the machine. He heads for the exit.

EXT, EIGHTH AVENUE -- EVENING

It’s gotten late. Danny comes out on to the street, and turns
the corner for Times Square.

Behind him, THE BIGGER KID from the arcade ambles out and
follows Danny down the block.

Danny waits impatiently for the traffic light to change.
Then, from behind, the KID taps him on the shoulder.

Danny togs East on 42nd street, his book bag flapping heavily
against his back. He passes the old New York Movie Houses <-

over his shoulder. All’s clear as he slows down right outside
the front entrance to the decrepit old, Asmedeun.

All of a sudden, the KID is right up in his face. Danny jumps
back and tries to push him away but the Kid grabs him by the
arm, and starts dragging him down the street.
DANNY
(struggling)
Get off...Get off of me.

Danny can‘t break free. The Kid shoves him into the alley
behind The Asmodeun and slams him up against the wall.

BIGGER KID
Get out your money.

Danny’s face is red, he’s scared, but he’s not going to cave
in. He gathers his strength and LUNGES forward at the kid,
trying to knock him over.

The BIGGER KID just steps back and grabs Danny again, this
time taking a swing at his face. His punch glances off
Danny’s cheek and sends him reeling back against the wall.

BIGGER KID
I didn’t want to hit you.

Danny tries to stabilize himself as the kid reaches into his
pocket and fishes out his wallet. He grabs out the money,
throws Danny’s wallet on the ground, and beats it down the
alley.

DANNY
(through angry tears)
Goddamnit!

The kid is almost out of the alley when the side door to the
theater opens and THE PROJECTIONIST, leaning on a@ walking

something.

The Projectionist ducks back into the alley door and

carrying an old SHOE BOX.

He slowly pries the lid off, then reaches in...

She reaches up to a cubbard to get him a plate when she
notices the bruise developing under his eye.

MOTHER
Danny, what’s that?

DANNY
What?

Then he remembers and averts his eyes.

MOTHER
Daniel look at me. What is that?

DANNY
(annoyed)
It’s nothing.

MOTHER

what happened, were you in a fight?. °
DANNY

No. (sarcastically) I got hit by a

Danny’s Mother stares at him. She doesn’t even know what to

say. She puts the plate down on the counter.

MOTHER

EXT. THE ASMODEUN THEATER -- NIGHT

Of all the theaters on the block, THE ASMODEUN is the biggest
and most run down. In,crooked red letters plastered up on to
the marquee, is the title "EXTREMELY VIOLENT".

It’s just after Midnight and pouring rain when Danny arrives
at the once grand front entrance to the theater. He yanks
hard on the heavy doors, somewhat surprised when they swing
right open. .

INT. ASMODEUN =

Danny shakes the rain off his sopping knapsack. It’s pitch
black inside, and he can’t find the lights. Blindly, he
stumbles forward, following the glowing neon lights of the
concession stand.

Edging his way along the walls, Danny reaches the theater
doors and pulls them open.

BATTING CAGE, TWO MEN practice pitching and
They are ARNO SLATER and his cousin FRANK.

Arne wears an old worn, U.S.M.C. CAP, and stands behind a
protector wall zinging pitches at his cousin in the batter’s

BOX.
ARNO

you‘’re made of.

Arno’s features tighten. He rears back and hurls the ball at
an unimaginable speed towards home plate...

Arno and Frank laugh heartily as Arno affectionately takes his
- U.S.M.C. HAT off and sticks it on Frank‘s head.

ARNO
Hats off, Frank, you're getting
better.

FRANK rides up on to the moving track, and shifts his car into
neutral. He rolls up his windows, smiling and whistling to
himself as his car disappears into the DARK CAR WASH.

THEN, @ pair of IDENTICAL TWINS, JULES and JIM, in matching
white linen suits, slip into the other end of the car wash.

INSIDE THE CAR WASH ~-
Frank’s car comes out from under a bank of rollers. His calm
expression takes on a troubled wrinkle, and then a look of
horror as out of the shadows come the Twins.
JULES swings back a crow bar and bashes open the sun roof
just as, uh oh, JIM hits the Simonization Switch, the het wax

Decker walks away leaving Arno alone at Frank’s head stone.

Arno solemnly takes the U.S. Marine Corps Cap, now spattered

with melted wax, and lays it across the grave.
Another COP comes up behind him.

He’s locking uD on screen; but something's bothering him. As
he moves his head back and forth, a thin shaft of white light
shoots out in the middle of the screen. It looks like the
TEAR has REOPENED.

He gets up from his seat and starts walking down the aisle.

‘

BACK ONSCREEN --

ARNO is sitting in his car, parked across the street from the
CAR WASH, locking out through a pair of binoculars.

ARNO'S BP.O.V =

The Twins, JULES and JIM, are in the middie of a drug buy fron
some local GANG MEMBERS, who have a pick-up truck filled with
hundreds of kilo bags of COCAINE.

BACK ON DANNY --

He‘’s right on stage at the end of the screen. Sure enough,
the tear has reopened. He sticks his hand inside feeling
around for his tape seam.

PROJECTIONIST
(0.8.)
Don’t forget our bargain, Danny...

Danny turns and stares back at The Projectionist, who. is
standing out on the balcony, smiling a terrible smile.

SUDDENLY, Danny feels his arm being yanked and....

IN SLOW MOTION ~~

The world begins to warp and bend, then it ZOOMS forward at
a thousand miles an hour. It stops with a jolt, and Danny
finds himself standing face to face with ARNO SLATER, who is
hoiding his arm in a vise-like grip.

ARNO
What are you doing here, kid?

DANNY is in a state of shock. He looks over his shoulder
The Theater is gone, no seats, no projection booth...

DANNY HAS BEEN SUCKED INTO THE FILM!
He is standing in the middle of a car wash, and ARNO SLATER
has a gun to his head.

ARNO grabs Danny by the collar when suddenly A HAIL OF GUNFIRE
rings out all around them. THREE VILLAINS are unloading -all
their ammo in their direction.

ARNO
Duck!

Arno yanks Danny with him as the dive into the dark interior
of the Car Wash.

INT. CAR WASH --

The inside of the car wash is a whirring, mechanical-mess of
brushes and hoses. Arno leads Danny along the wall.

BEHIND THEM --

are the three Mercs who just fired at them. They stand at the
entrance, peering into the darkness.

IN FRONT OF THEM --

Is the DRUG TRUCK, frothing up wet cocaine, and moving slowly
towards the end of the cycle.

ARNO
This way.
Arno creeps over to the truck.

Arno puts his fist through the window of the truck, then
reaches in and cpens the doer.

Uhhh, three guys, but... 3

INT. TRUCK CAB --

DANNY is lying on the floor of the pitch dark truck. Big,
wet, soapy cloths flap against the window every few seconds.

CLOSE ON =~
Danny’s face: Sweaty, red...he’s flipping out.

It starts getting lighter and lighter in the truck, and Danny
realizes that he’s about to be sent out on to the lot.

Suddenly, it stops.

You missed.

The shooting starts all over again, although this time the
screams of dying Mercs echo through the Car Wash.

BACK ON DANNY’S FACE --

He takes his hands off his ears, and comes out from behind his
KNAPSACK. Silence.

The. broken truck door slowly swings cpen. Danny peers
outside.

EXT. CAR WASH PARKING LOT --

what Danny sees is a testimony to the extreme violence that
just occurred.

The asphalt is pockmarked, filled with bullet holes; the
ground is littered with severed Merc limbs, bullet cases, and
discarded firearms.

DANNY ~-

pulls himself out of the truck. He looks back up onto the
flatbed and sees

ARNO +-~

standing up there, wiping off his prized laser-scope gun with
a hanky and surveying the area.

ARNO
Wrong. The Twins got away.

He hops down off the back of the flatbed, then picks up a DEAD
MERC. °

ARNO
(shaking him}
Who are you working for? -~
He bangs him against the ground.

ARNO
wWhere’s the money? Talk, asshole!

He slams him again. Danny walks up behind Arno. Then he
notices something...

IN THE DISTANCE --

A BLACK CAR, screaming down the street right towards Arno and
Danny.

DANNY
Um, Arno?

Arno'’s searching the guy’s pockets.

DANNY
(tapping him on the shoulder)
Uhh, Arno. I. think we’ve got

trouble..
He’s right, cause coming up on them fast is...
THE TWINS’ BLACK PEUGEOT --
The identical brothers sitting in the front seat, Jules

driving, Jim loading the guns.

DANNY
Arno!

Finally, Arno looks up. The Black Peugeot is about to smash
right into them.

ARNO
Move back.

In Slow-Mo, Arno whirls around, falls to his knees and aims.
The laserlight dances off the car steering wheel, then on to

33
Jules’ driving hand and...

WHAMMO

His first shot cracks the windshield, the Twins just laugh...
BLAMMO

Arno’s second shot blows a hole througn the windshield,
hitting Jules’ hand. He yelps and swerves, sending the car
careening off to Arno’s side.

AT THE SAME TIME --

TEN POLICE CARS, their sirens screaming, hurtle towards the
car wash.

The Black Peugeot pulls around, Jules and Jim quickly switch
places in the front seat. The window slides down, and Jules
leans out, clutching his bleeding hand.

JULES
You are a dead man, Slater...

JIM
And your leetle friend, too!

They gun the engine and screech off towards the highway. +

ARNO AND DANNY are standing in the middle of the wreckage, as
cops swarm out of their cars and descend on then.

Two cops, KILLGALLON and MCMURPHY sidle up to Arno.

ARNO
Killgalion, McMurphy. Radio in an
APB, two of them got away...

KILLGALLON
Forget it Slater. The Chief wants to
see you. Pronto.

Arno reaches in and pulls Danny out of the car.

Arno lets him go.

DANNY

Arno climbs back in the car. Danny’s getting really nervous
now.

Arno turns to face hin.

ON THE HIGHWAY --
Arne hurtles down the streets of Los Angeles at 120 mph.
Danny, in the passenger seat, clutches his shoulder strap for

dear life.

Arno takes an incredible, 90 degree left turn, then a quick
right and swerves into the parking lot of the Police Precinct.

INT. PRECINCT -- DAY

Big. burly cops in aviator sunglasses hustle scuzzy criminals
off to their holding pens. ‘Angry citizens complain about
crimes to the DESK SERGEANT. Hard boiled cops who’ve seen it
all twice munch donuts and drink coffee at their desks.

Into this chaos strides ARNO SLATER.

DANNY, trying to stop and savor the hyped up film-world, keeps
having to run to catch up with Arno’s huge strides.

DANNY
So I guess Captain Decker’s gonna
give you a hard time now, huh?

ARNO
For what? For doing my job and
getting the scum off the streets?

DANNY
Well, no, I thought he was always
giving you shit...

ARNO
Decker and I go way back. He was in
my platoon in Nam. I saved his life.
Suddenly, a voice rings out from the back of the precinct.
DECKER
SLATER! Goddamn it, Slater, get your
greasy melons in here, right now!
Danny smiles.

ARNO
Wait here.

Arno disappears into Decker’s office, jeaving Danny alone in
the huge precinct.

His attention drifts over to a desk, where two DETECTIVES are
arguing heatedly. One of themn’s black, and fastidiously neat,
the other white and a complete wreck.

Meanwhile, Danny wads up the gum and stuffs it in the ashtray.
He gets the bartender’s attention and calls him over.

style ranch house.
INT. THE SLATER HOME -- DAY

Arne barrels through the front door and heads straight for the

bedpan. .

Danny walks over to the bookcases lining the walls.

his library, no collections of essays, no coffee table art
pooks.

What he does have, however is THE TIME LIFE GUIDE TO KILLING
PEOPLE, WHO’S WHO IN AMERICAN DRUG DEALING. and BULLETS OF THE
WORLD.

ARNO has been heating up the screwdriver with the
Zippo. It’s red hot now. He lays it down in the bed pan,

JESSICA

gun...
Arno hands her his Beretta.
JESSICA

I’ll clean it for you while I do my
hair. Nice meeting you, Danny.

Jessica scoots out of the room with her coffee and the gun.
Arno smiles and looks after her. Suddenly, he turns to Danny.

ARNO
Let’s go. We have work to do..

Arno leads Danny through the Kitchen and down the stairs to
the BASEMENT. They come to a thick steel: door.

DANNY
So, what‘’s this? Storage area?

Arno smiles.

INT. BASEMENT --

Danny and Arno step inside, coming face to face with an
awesome display of firepower that would put the Pentagon to
shame.

DANNY
Whoa...

Arno has neatly arranged the room by handguns, rifles, rocket
launchers, and explosives. Danny walks over to a large,
futuristic. gun and tries to pull it off the wall. It’s too
heavy for him to lift, however, and just as it’s about to

ARNO

dangerous weapons, not for kids.

DANNY
I was just looking...

Arno hefts the enormous gun up into ready position.

DANNY
What is that thing, anyway?

/ ARNO

Roland Street Sweeper. Anti-riot,

anti-tank. Fires a 12 mm shell. (he

aims it) You can take out a city

. block with one shot. i love this
gun.

Danny keeps moving, he walks over to another section, where
Arno keeps his more primitive weapons. He stops in front of
a high tech BOW AND ARROW with a complicated pully system
attached. . :

ARNO :
You like that? The arrows have
exploding tips. .
” DANNY

It looks familiar.

ARNO
I got it from an old Nam buddy.
Crazy guy. He got arrested a few
years ago...Blew up a small town.

They move down even farther to his last exhibit, a gun kept
in a hermetically sealed, climate controlled box. Arno pops
the seals and pulls the gun out.

ARNO
Now this...{he holds the gun up)
This is my Beretta from the war. An
amazing gun, saved my life a thousand
times. It has great action, reloads
quickly...{yelling) BAM! BAM!

Re puts it back up on the wall.
I love that gun.
ar Tk:
FIRING RANGE --

Arno has a professional firing range set up just behind his
arsenal.

ARNO walks up to one of the stalls, hefting four er five
weapons, including the one’s he’s already showed Danny.

Danny hustles up behind him.

DANNY
So your wife, she’s pretty
understanding about all this.

ARNO ?
What do you mean?

DANNY
Well, you know, all the guns in the
house, you’ coming home bleeding.
That’s -pretty messed up. Don’t you
think it’s a little strange that she
puts up with it?

Arno turns to Danny, angered by his questioning.

. . ARNO °
: . Strange? Is it strange to fight
- crime, to stop criminals from harming
innocent people with their evil ways?

DANNY
No, I...

ARNO
Is it strange for a wife to support
her husband as he struggles to avenge
the death of his cousin? If there’s
something wrong with that, Danny,
then there’s something wrong with me
too! -

He picks up the Beretta and pumps off a few rounds, hitting
the target in the eyes, nose and mouth. .

ARNO

The Twins.

He picks up the compound bow and zips a few arrows into the
mannequin’s chest.

DANNY
No, I know... I mean, obviously the
Twins are involved. Iomean, who do
you think they’re working for?

ARNO
A big drug dealer.

DANNY
: (getting frustrated)
Obviously, they were selling drugs.
But the point is, there’s always
something more... a conspiracy.

Arno hefts up an assault rifle.

DANNY

i You know, like they’re really working
for a huge corporation, or they’re
using drug deals as a decoy for 4
. political assassination. (beat) Do
' you know any corporate criminals or
corrupt Senators who might have

‘ Arno fires off a few more rounds, these blowing the right arm
off the mannequin.

ARNO
I don’t know who they are, Danny.

Arno now picks up the Roland Street Sweeper.

(cont.)
But I know where they’re going.

-Arne fires a deafening round from the street sweeper,
pulverizing what’s left of the dummy into dust.

DANNY

As they walk out through the arsenal, ARNO picks up two metal
rods attached by an electrical cord.

DANNY

He smiles and touches them together, setting off sparks.

ARNO
Taser Sticks. They can stun an
elephant.

THE LIVING ROOM --

Jessica is in the kitchen now, dressed in a tight black dress,
carefully cleaning the last few parts in Arne’s gun and
putting it back together. Arno bounds into the room, carrying
a@ogym bag, Danny close behind. He grabs some Gatorade from
the fridge, takes a swig, then heads for the door.

ARNO :
Bye honey, have a good day at work.

ARNO
Time for payback.

DANNY
Ah, Arno...Tell me if I’m way off

Wait, Arno...

Arno reaches cver the desk. picks up the yellow bellied Desk
Clerk by his tie and head butts him into a coma.

They walk past the desk and into a door marked ‘Locker Room’.

ar T:
THE WORKOUT ROOM -

A high-tech ego-maniac’s playground, filled with hard-bodied
Californians in tight spandex body gloves. On one end of the
room, six gargantuan MUSCLE HEADS are doing curls in a circle.
Into the weight room come Danny and Arno. Arno is bulging out
of his tight T-Shirt and shorts, while Danny seems lost in the
folds of his.

Under his towel, Arno is carrying his Taser Sticks like a bus
boy. He walks up to the Universal Machine, drops a pin in
the bottom hole, and begins benching a few tons of iron.

The MUSCLE HEADS look on, ticked off by Arno’s hot-shotting
in their gym.

ON THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM --

The DESK CLERK from the front hall rushes in, clutching his
sore head. He skips over to the angry MUSCLE HEADS, and
begins pointing to Arno. They get up from their bench and
strut over to the Universal.

Arno continues to pump away, concentrating on his routine.
Then, as Arno pushes the bar upward, one of the goons pulls
his pin out. Without the resistance to hold him back, Arno
slams upward ripping the benching bar out of its socket.

ARNO
Is there a problem?

The MUSCLE HEADS gang around him swinging big free-weights in
their hands.

MUSCLEHEAD #1
This club is for members only. We
have a problem with free-loaders.
ARNO
I’m here on a trial membership.

54
 

MUSCLEHEAD #1
Because the equipment isn’t much good
to a dead man.

Two of the thugs jump Arno, and he deflects their attack with
the benching bar, sending them to the ground.

ARNO
Good work-cut. Who’s next?

DANNY --

has been checking this out, and satisfied that Arno is more
than holding his own, decides to do a little investigating.
He sneaks up a spiral lucite staircase to the second floor.
SECOND FLOOR =

The health club’s administrative offices. Danny creeps down
the hall and comes to a door marked "Employees oOniy".

Quietly, he cracks it open and sees inside...

A MEETING ROOM -

A map of the world is spread out over the far wall. A MAN

with a walking cane is talking, his back to DANNY.

On the glass table in front of him is a “compretrenstve lay-out
of DEADLY WEAPONRY.

ar

_INT, THE WORKOUT ROOM -

Meanwhile, one of the MUSCLE HEADS is lecking horns with Arno
in front of the Nautilus.

Arno gets some leverage on him, and dunks him down into the
butterfly press, boxing his ears with the press arms.

No sooner has he dispensed with him, when another Steak~-Head
is climbing on his back. Arne takes him in a half-nelson, and
shoves the guy’s face into the spokes of a whizzing life
cycle. SPLOOSH!

55
(@

 

Turning away from the squash court, satisfied that the guy he
just tossed is sufficiently dead, he turns back to face the
empty room when...

WHAM!
Two fists punch him at cence, knocking him on his ass.

It’s the TWINS, dressed in their poncey frog workout clothes.
They stand over him, smiling. One of them, GULES, has a
bandaged hand.

JULES
You’re a'dead man, Slater.

ar

THE MEETING ROOM UPSTAIRS -

Danny’s looking in through the crack in the door, A big arms
deal is obviously coming down.

Then, the MAN with the cane turns around and Danny gets a
glimpse of his frightening face.

It’s covered in bandages.

ar Be
THE WORKOUT ROOM -

Arno and the Twins .are engaged in a furious hand to hand
struggle. While he might have no problem with either one of
them individually, together they are a menace. One Twin DUCKS
as the other PUNCHES, catching Arno offguard and sending him
backwards on to-the STAIRMASTER.

The fight vacillates back and forth until the Twins have Arno
cornered against the Universal Machine.

Jim takes a swing at Arno, and in one smooth motion, Arno
lifts the bench press bar, grabs Jim’s fist, and slips it
under the weights. He then lets go of the bar, crushing Jim’s
hand and leaving him stuck to the Universal, screaming.

Enraged, Jules flies at Arne, but the big man head butts him,
and hurls him towards his brother. The pissed Twins clutch

Arno, standing on the other side of the UNIVERSAL, pulls out

ARNO
Now, I’m going te make French Fries.

JULES
. We're Belgian, you idiot.

Arno lays the Taser sticks against the metal bars of the
weight-lifting machine, arid’ grips the handles. A surge of
electricity zaps through the machine, and thén through the
Twins, jolting them into unconsciousness.

Arno is busily tying up the unconscious Lumiere brothers with
weight-lifting cords when DANNY comes running over.

DANNY
Arno...There’s some sort of huge arns
deal going down in the back roon.

ARNO
Good work, Danny.

DANNY
And I think whoever was behind
Frank’s death is upstairs running the
show, .

ARNO
I’1l destroy him.

But, at that moment, a figure appears at the top of the
stairs. It’s the bandaged-faced MAN with the walking cane.

You’ll do nothing of the kind, Mr.

Arno spins around and beholds his old Nemesis, MR.ID.

Arno heads for the stairs.

- MR.ID

is growing rather tedious. Luckily
for me, I don’t have to hear much
more of it.

And then, as if on cue, ten police officers storm into the
room, led by Killgallen and McMurphy.

MR.ID
j : Ah, right on time. Gentlemen, this

property. My property.

But Arno keeps steaming up the stairs, until Killgallon
catches up to him.

DANNY
Arno, it’s the Twins!
ARNO
Good, we'll kill two birds with one

stone.
But Arno’s busy puzzling out the instruction manual. Slowly,
he sticks the parts into place. It’s starting to look like
a weapon, but it’s upside down. Just as the Copter passes

feet above the ground right in their path.

arno continues to dicker with the launcher.

ARNO
It’s these Russian instructions, and
then they never give you all the

The copter is making it’s final assault turn, the Twins wink
to each cther, and open fire, strafing the ground at Arno and
Danny’s feet.

Arno aims, pulls the trigger, and...click. Another did.

ARNO :
I think we’re missing a spring.

DANNY
Oh, great...

In a second, the copter will be directly overhead.
Arno takes a long hard look at his new Russian Launcher.

ARNO
What a rip off.

Then his mighty hand grips the pivot rod, rips the missile~
head off the stand, takes it back in his arm, and as the
copter passes overhead he hurls it javelin style right into
the tail-blade, blowing it clean off.

The Twins give a lock back towards the tail of the Chopper.

CARS all over the place; parked, circling, coming and going,
but no spaces.

ARNO
(furious)
I can never find a goddamn spot here!

JUST -THEN, down the row, a space opens up. Danny makes a turn
right for it, but a YUPPIE in a littie red sports car shoots
in just in front of him.

DANNY
What an asshole.

ARNC
Wait here.

Arno gets out and walks over to the sports car.

The YUPPIE, in the driver’s seat, sees Arno coming up in his
side view mirror, and turns a whiter shade of pale.

DRIVER'S P.0.V. --

Arno’s massive torso leaning into his window...Arno grinning
wide. .

ARNO
You just made a Big Mistake.

The YUPPIE swallows his tongue, screeches into reverse and
hauls out of there. -

Danny smiles and pulls into the space.

Arno and Danny quickly weave their way through the onrush of
shoppers.

DANNY
Okay, where does your wife work?

ARNO
Top floor, the jewelry store. Come

DANNY
No, the elevator, it’s much faster.

INT. ELEVATOR --

Rushing upward, Danny and Arno peer cut the glass elevator

The elevator reaches the top, Arno bolts out.

Danny hesitates a second, then presses every button in the
elevator, looks three floors down at the MERCS, and grins.

Arno’s up ahead waving him on, Running past the DOWN
ESCALATOR, Danny plows into a kid in a baby stroller.

ARNO
Danny, come on.

He rights the stroller, then it hits him: it’s THE MOTHER AND
CHILD from the TRAILER. Quickly, he snaps on the child-
restraint belt, and turns to the mother.
DANNY
Lady, you really gotta start watching
out for your kid.

The concerned mother bends over and hugs her child, as Danny
and Arno take off down the hallway.

INT. DAVIDSON JEWELERS --
Arno’s wife, JESSICA, -
She’s listening to her Walkman, reading

“COP WIFE: THE MAGAZINE FOR THE WOMEN, BEHIND THE MEN, BEHIND

The Cover Story depicts a Cop Wife, still dressed in her house
apron, but now armed to the teeth with a necklace of deadly
weapons.

“MY HUSBAND GOT SUSPENDED, NOW I WEAR THE BADGE!

ARNO
The guys who killed Frank are in the

DANNY .

Can we explain this Later?

JESSICA
And you want to set up a surprise
ambush and kill them? Good thinking,
we can tip over the display tables

ARNO
No, we’ve got to get out of here,
quickly.

JESSICA
But, then you’ll miss them...

DANNY
Yeah, that’s the point.

ARNO
Danny’s got it all figured out.

» JESSICA
(shocked)
I can’t believe my ears. Since when
did Arno Slater start running away
from criminals?

ARNO
Jessica, it‘s not like that.
We're... (he looks at Danny for

INT. MALL HALLWAY <--

Danny and Arno are back in the Mall Traffic when they spot the
THREE MERCS from the opening trailer converging at the
Elevator Banks below.

DANNY
Quick, the elevators!

The Three Mercs look deadly and determined, waiting calmly for
the lift. They check their watches, and load up their guns.

Then, DING, it arrives, the doors swoosh open, and look who’s
there, it’s Arno pointing his Beretta right ‘in their faces.

ARNO
Fourth floor...Guns and Ammo!

Then, Boom, boom, boom they drop in formation.

Arno and Danny book through the mall towards the elevators,

ARNO and DANNY tear by the huge NEWS KIOSK, when Danny
suddenly remembers...

DANNY

Oh, shit! I ate the gum!
ARNO

So what?
DANNY

Arno, trust me, we need some gum.

Danny and Arno run up, grab a pack of gum off the shelf and
hand it to the COUNTER GUY.

COUNTER GUY

Arno and Danny search their pockets...NOTHING.

COUNTER GUY
No money, no gum.

Arno shrugs. Danny grabs Arne’s gun and points it at the guy.

DANNY :
Big Mistake.

‘The Counter Guy is just able to hand over the gum .before
fainting.

SUDDENLY -- The air is pierced by the cacophonous fury of one
thousand horns and car alarms blasting out at once.

Jessica covers her ears in agony as Arno and Danny come
running down the ramp like bats out of hell, pulling the gum
out of their ears. 7

through Santa Monica along the beach.

in beachfront Santa Monica. Danny is staring intently at
something up ahead.

JESSICA
Arno, I/m tired of this, I want to go
home. .
ARNO .
Alright, honey, we’ll see if...
DANNY
. We can’t go home, Jessica. That’s

the first place they’d look, there’s
probably guys waiting for us right
now.

: JESSICA
Well I’ve got work to do, and I’m not
in the mood for cops and robbers.
Where are we going?
Danny points straight ahead.

DANNY
There...

They lock up to see, in the distance...

“EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER ~- .

ARNO, JESSICA and DANNY stride across a walkway towards the
SANTA MONICA PIER, a somewhat run down amusement center right
on’ the water.

The Pier is a swirling mixture of bad seafood restaurants,
cheap ice cream shops and cheesy carnival games that are
impossible to win.

Arno is fascinated by the good-natured activity on the Pier.
He’s never been to an amusement park before. Jessica is not
as pleased.

JESSICA
I don’t get it, why are we at an
amusement park?

ARNO
She’s right, Danny. I never come

catch up with us, they always do.
But instead of going to them, we let

about 200 cops down here, the
villains show up looking for us, they
get wasted. (Danny smiles) We hang

It’s brilliant. That’s a great plan,
Danny. 1/11 call Decker. ,

JESSICA
If it’s so simple, how come I’ve
gotten kidnapped so many times? How
come I’m always in danger, if all you
need to do is call the police?

Look, Jessica, you’re not gonna get
kidnapped again. So just relax and
enjoy yourself.

Danny and Jessica walk through a gauntlet of video games.
Jessica doesn’t seem to like any of them. She points toward

Oh, look, Skee Ball.

SKEE BALL --

Danny and Jessica pitch the hard, wooden bails up the ramp
toward the holes.

JESSICA

Damnit...

DANNY
This is really lame. You gotta try
Double Dragon, now that’s a good
game...

Danny tosses a skee ball, just as Arno walks over to them.
He’s carrying a Soft-Serv ice cream cone.

ARNO
Alright, I spoke to Decker. They’re
sending 30 cars, they should be here
in ten minutes.

JESSICA
‘(frustrated)
Well then I’m gonna go look around.
You boys have fun...

Jessica leaves.

You know, Danny, this stuff is great!
It’s all cold and creamy...

DANNY
You’ve never had ice cream before?

ARNO
I’ve never played air hockey either!

He smashes home a goal.

ARNO
I don’t usually have time for this...

DANNY
Iocan imagine...

ARNO
I’m too busy out busting criminals
and exacting vengeance...(he blocks
a shot)... but this is great!

Danny scores on Arno, ending the game. _

DANNY
You lose again, Slater.

Arno laughs and puts down his paddle.

ARNO
(wistfully)
I wish Jessie and I did stuff like
this more often. It seems like the
only time I ever see her is when
we’re making a getaway, or when she’s
taping up one of my wounds...

DANNY
Yeah, well you’re a busy guy, Arno. 3

ARNO
Maybe. (beat) Do you know why we've
never had children?

DANNY

No, TI just thought...

ARNO :

a child would just be one more person
to kidnap, one more obligation that
would stop me from fulfilling. my
duties. Well now I’m suspended, and
all these criminals are out to get

Arno looks down at Danny, who’s listening to him raptly.

ARNO
Come on Danny, let’s go outside...

ON THE PIER <-~

Arno stops to buy another ice cream cone. The two of them
walk along the Pier soaking up the warm, California sun.

ARNO.
You’re a smart kid. You must make
your parents very proud.

Danny has grown very quiet. He walks to the edge of the pier
and looks out over the water.

DANNY
Yeah, I guess...

ARNO
What’s wrong, Danny?

DANNY
Nothing. It’s just that this all
reminds me a lot of Coney Isiand, in-
New York...

ARNO :
Sure, I busted some Jamaican drug
smugglers there.

DANNY
Yeah, well this might be a different
Coney Island, the one where I’m from.
My Dad and I used to go out there,

DANNY
Nah, it’s not that. (beat) My
father died, Arno. He‘s dead...

ARNO

(shocked)

Did someone kill him?

DANNY
No, no he died of -cancer. They
didn’t know what it was fer a long
time. The doctor’s jerked him

around, the hospitals kept switching
the treatments. My mom was a wreck,
she just withdrew from it all...

ARNO
I’m sorry, Danny, it’s very hard to
lose someone who means so much to
you...

DANNY
(heatedly)
Yeah, but the whole thing was so
lame, he just sat there dying and I
didn’t do shit to help him...

ARNO
Well, Danny, there wasn’t much you
could do...

DANNY
Look at you, Arno! Someone kills
your cousin Frank, you go get payback
for it! You find the guys who killed
him and wipe them off the face of the
earth! That must make you feel
better, at least you’re doing
something...

Arno takes a long, hard look at Danny, listening to the anger
and bitterness in his voice. He wonders, perhaps for the
first time, just how much better vengeance makes him feel.

ARNO
Danny...

Arno’s sentence is interrupted when his ice cream scoop

spiattering all over nis face.

ARNO

He locks down at the cone, and both he and Danny watch as it
too explodes in his hand.

DANNY
Look!

They look down to the end of the Pier and realize -~ someone
is shooting at them.

ARNO
The game room, now!

Under a hail of bullets, Arno and Danny run around behind the
tent for cover.

DANNY
Jesus Christ, how they'd find us so
. quickly?
ARNO

And where are Decker’s men?
They hear footsteps, men shouting and coming closer.

Arno leads them around the tent and in throuch a flap. they
see five of Id’s men enter the tent, all brandishing guns.

THE ARCADE CROWD flies into a state of total panic, running
and diving under tables and games.

THE GROUND --

ARNO and “DANNY are crawling along the floor. ARNO holds his
Beretta, Danny drags his bookbag.

ARNO
I thought | you said the Pier would be
safe?

Another cloud of bullets shatters a wall of Video Machines

DANNY looks ready, then something occurs to hin.

DANNY
Arno... Just one question... (beat)
Aren’t we out of bullets?

Arno checks the chamber on his Beretta. Sure enough, it’s
empty. - :

DANNY

Remember? You ran out in the mall...
ARNO

That’s right. (he looks around)

Okay, don’t worry, I have a plan.

Arno crab-walks backwards along the floor, dedging bullets,
until he reaches the SKEE BALL booths.

Grabbing a rock hard SKEE BALL, he springs to his feet and
goes into a Nuclear pitching wind-up.

An unlucky Gunman tries to duck, but it’s too late, the Skee’
Ball has conked him into next week.

DANNY smiles and tosses Arno a handful of balis., ARNO goes
into a rotary launching fury, running across the room, wasting
every Gunman in his path.

BUT he’s out of balls, and there’s a gun pointing right in his
face...

‘With lightening speed, Arno tumble rolls on to the air hockey

sets and scoops up a bundle of pucks. The Gunman just gets
his aim, when a bright PLASTIC PUCK zings into his forehead.

ARNO
Let’s move, Danny...

waiting for Arno to emerge.

Danny is petrified, he strains against his captor...

. BAD GUY
- You heard the man, call’him, or you
die!

But Danny won’t do it, and the bad guy shoves him to the
ground. As he falls, he hears a clanking sound when his
bookbag hits the pier. THEN, he remembers.

JIM
Go ahead, keel hin. We’ll get the
big guy anyway...

the gunman cocks his pistol.

GUNMAN
So long, kid...

Danny reaches into his bookbag, then points up towards the
gunman...
DANNY
Bye, asshole!

What> "explodes through the end of Danny’s bookbag would be best
described as firing a cruise missile through a pea-shooter.
The force is incredible, it tears the bookbag to shreds and
the gunman is literally blown to dust. No blood, no guts,
just a fine cloud of bad guy residue.

DANNY
Holy shit...
Danny looks down at his hand in wonder. He’s holding the gun
The Projectionist gave him. It glows a bright metallic blue,
smoke pours from the barrel.

Two other BAD GUYS run towards Danny...

BAD GUY #2 runs up and grabs Danny’s hand. Danny looks down
at where he’s been grabbed.

His skin is somehow GLOWING. It’s like he’s in technicolor
and the rest of the world’s in sepia tone.

Danny closes his eyes as BAD GUY #2 rears back and PUNCHES him
in the face.

Danny opens his eyes. The guy is staring at him. His face
feels fine. He lunges forward, and the result astonishes

him...

BAD GUY #2 is sent hurtling end over end down the Pier, at
least 100 ft, racking up in a ring toss booth.

DANNY
. Jesus...

MEANWHILE -~

Arno is body slamming a group of attackers. In typical Arno
fashion, he’s holding his own even though there's at least ten
of then.

Suddenly, bodies start flying off him one by one, and Arno
sees DANNY, fighting really awkwardly, but kicking total ass
nonetheless.

. ARNO
Danny! What’s happened to you,
you’re glowing!

Danny tosses the last attacker into the arcade tent.

Arno watches in disbelief. The Bad Guy’s attack has been
completely repelled. Id’s men lie all over the pier,
unconscious.

ARNO
That was incredible, Danny.

Suddenly, footsteps. SEVEN MORE MEN are running down the pier
towards Arno and Danny.

The force of the blast blows the bad guys out of their shoes,
shaking the pier to its foundations.

Arno and Danny look around. All the assailants have fled: in
fact, the entire pier is deserted, except for...

All the way at the other end, THE TWINS are dragging JESSICA
towards their Peugeot. Parked around them are three black
Lexus’s, filled with Mercs.

Jules shoves Jessica into the back seat and screeches away.

ARNO

They start running down the pier when suddenly, Arno stops.

He’s even brighter than before.

Danny flips down the sun shade, and checks his face out in the
vanity mirror.

The Villains are gaining distance up ahead. They turn off
down a bumpy stretch of road. .

We're losing them. Hang on.

ARNO spins the wheel, making sick turns, swerving through
gridlocked traffic and running lights.

As they walk down the biock, they pass the two workers with

with afternoon eaters.

A HUCKSTER, pushing a FRUIT CART rumbles past them down the
street.

They keep walking, passing RACKS OF BEEF dangling over the
sidewalk on meat hocks.

On the other side, they pass FIRE HYDRANTS, GARBAGE CANS, a
STUDENT DRIVER CAR, and finally, at the end, a trucker
directing his friend, in an EIGHTEEN-WHEELER, back first into
traffic.

DANNY
This is it.
As Danny and Arno stand at the end of the block, they look

back over the street. It is a domino line of every CAR CHASE
OBSTACLE you’ve ever seen, all packed together on one block.

the far end of the street. .

DANNY
Any minute now...

THEN, sure enough, from the other end of the block, the
Villains’ Cars come barreling on to Chase Street.

The LEAD CAR races down the road, crashes through the PLATE
OF GLASS, topples the FRUIT CART, to the angry yells of the
HUCKSTER, and then plows into a FIRE HYDRANT.

The gushing water spray causes the second Villain Car to veer
off into the rows of HANGING BEEF, and the third to rack up

The Villains have practically made it through Chase Street
when the mammoth EIGHTEEN WHEELER starts backing up inte the
road. The Villains are sizing up the situation. It looks
Like there’ll just be enough room to squeeze through. They'll
just cut around the back.

But there's DANNY, his gun pointed at the truck.

DANNY
Back up faster!

TRUCK DRIVER
(petrified)
But...Then they won‘t...
Danny puts the gun to the Driver’s head.
DANNY
Faster!

The DRIVER steps on it, and the huge truck picks up speed and,
uh-oh, closes the little remaining gap.

The Peugeot veers off into the wall, as the three” Lexuses
rack up in a heap under the truck.

The fifteen indefatigable MERCS spring from their cars and
take up positions guarding JESSICA in the center.

DANNY AND ARNO --
are standing safely’on the other side of the truck.
DANNY -
You go around the front, I‘ll take
the back. We blast them from both
ends, and meet in the middle.

MERCS spin around to face them.

Suddenly, Arno panics...

But Danny, on the other side of the truck, is in a kill frenzy
and can’t hear him.

Th it’s too late. THE TWINS have seen Arno panicking, and
now they’ re coming right for hin.

DANNY is busy blowing away MERCS with two fists, firing Arno‘s
gun and his own, in an arabesque of Extreme Violence.

ON THE OTHER SIDE -~ : ue

Arno is struggling bare handedly with JULES | AND JIM. He‘’s
just barely holding his own, wrestling his armed attackers to
the ground. But the Twins are relentless.

At the same time, Danny manages to penetrate the MERC’S guard
circle. With one hand he valiantly springs JESSICA from the
car, and with the other he blasts three Mercs into oblivion.
ON THE OTHER END, Arno’s in bad shape. THE TWINS have him
cornered and they’re about to play their favorite trick.
dules runs around and kneels behind Arno’s legs as Jim pushes
Arno over backwards. He bangs his head down on the cement.

INT. DECKER‘’S OFFICE, POLICE PRECINCT -- NIGHT

Decker sits behind his Desk at the precinct, anxiously
wringing his hands, and waiting for a phone call. He chomps
down on his cigar, and looks at his watch. Then the phone
rings.

DECKER
Decker...(beat, his face lights up}
You’re joking. (beat) When are you
going to kill him?... What about a
little torturing or something
first?...Perfect, he should really
enjoy that...

_Decker hangs up the phone, pours himself a celebratory Chivas

Regal out of a hidden bottle in his desk, then heads out of
the office whistling, a new spring noticeable in his step.

PRECINCT PARKING LOT --

Decker, giddy and a little tipsy, is sauntering over to. his
lemon colored Oldsmobile, doing a little jig as he reaches for
his car Keys, and then all of sudden he freezes...Because the
cold steel of a Browning 9 mm is being thrust into the back
of his skull. .

DECKER
Whoever you are, you‘re making a big
mistake...-

VOICE

‘You made the big mistake, Decker.

Decker spins around to see DANNY, standing behind him. He’s
glowing brighter than ever.

DECKER

talking about...

DANNY

INT. ABANDONED MOVIE STUDIO -- NIGHT

An enormous, run down Sound Stage now functions as the
Villains’ Main Warehouse.

Overhead, there is an iron CATWALK, once the Lighting Bridge,
that runs the perimeter of the room, connected in the middle
by a cross-bridge.

ID'S Sentinels are posted all over the place, pacing the
perimeter from above.

At one end of the room is ARNO, his arms tied together over
his head, secured to a long ceiling chain.

‘Bound, and manacled, Arno is defenseless against the cruel

punishments being administered to him by JULES and JIM, expert
torture specialists.

JULES .
Power is ready, Jim? .

JIM .
Yes, Jules. I have channeled the

master power unit into this one ,
dangerously loose wire.

JULES
Oh, then we must be most careful not
to touch it...Especially if we are
somehow wet at the time.

Jules then sticks Arno’s feet into a bucket of water.

dim then presses the end of the long cable up against Arno’s
bare chest. His massive frame begins to seethe and convulse,
but he grits back the pain, refusing to scredm out.

ENTERING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR comes the infamous MR. ID, his
face wrapped in bandages, followed by a full compliment of his
hardiest Mercs.

Through the pain, Arno spots ID on the other end of the room,
and he chafes against his chains.

ARNO
Id, I’m going to rip your bandaged
head right off that skinny neck!

MR. ID
Ah, if it isn’t Arno Slater, the
walking muscle. I trust you’re

enjoying the accommodations...

ARNO
I’ll enjoy burning them down.

MR.ID

That wouldn’t be advisable. I went to
great lengths to cbtain this space,
Mr. Slater. The man who owned the
building made a rather comprehensive
deal with me. When he defaulted, I
‘collected this studio, as well as
other valuables far more precious.
And, as I’m sure you know already,
mercy is not one of my strengths...

ARNO

is that why you killed Frank, Id? To
prove how ruthless and evil you are?

o7
&

e_

MR.ID
You Never get any smarter, doa you?
Your cousin Frank’s death was an
error. A foul up. A completely
unnecessary killing that I, above
all, regret.

ARNO
What?

MR.ID ;
It was you whom we intended to kill,
Slater. Frank was wearing your hat,
he came out of your gym, and you both
have that Cro Magnon Slouch...

ARNO
(disbelieving) -
It was all a mistake?

MR.ID
I was just as upset as you were. I
despise incompetence. I can assure
you, however, that we will be far
more thorough when it comes to
killing you.

ARNO
I/ll see you in Hell, Id!

MR.ID
That’s right, you will. (he laughs)
Jules, Jim, destroy this Mongoloid
half-wit before I do it myself.

They sizzle Arno with another rocking dose of electricity.

ARNO
You French assholes!

JULES
We’re not French assholes...

JIM
We’re Belgian assholes!

Jules takes a smoldering hot iron out of his bag, and presses
it against Arno‘’s chest.

Arno bites back the pain silently as his skin sizzles.

MR.ID

iu’s okay to be upset, Slater, iet

your emetions out, cry if you feel

like it.

THEN, suddenly...

A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION at the far end of the room.

AN ENORMOUS HOLE has been blown in the wall, sending bricks,

plaster and dust flying everywhere. There is silence for a
moment. A cloud of dust and smoke hangs.in the air.

THEN, A VOICE --

VOICE
I’m coming for you Id!

SFX - A low rumbling of steel wheels.

An old CAMERA DOLLY parts the smoke, rolling through the hole
and out into the room. .

on top of the DOLLY, steering, is DANNY.
IN HIS RIGHT HAND --
A smoking bazooka...

Two more of Id’s men, dead. He tosses them to the ground.

lays it across the bow. Down the shaft, at its point, a shiny
golden triangle...An explosive head.

ON THE BRIDGE --

Id’s men yell “Fire!

releases the arrow...

The arrow, whizzing through the air and then...
THE BRIDGE EXPLODES

It’s the Fourth of July, as human fireworks light the air.

DANNY! Watch out!

A TOP=CLASS MERC --

The red dot from the laser travels up the man’s back and...
BLAM! .

e He tumbles over head first.
NOW, THE ROOM -~

Is a panorama of death and destruction. Bodies lie scattered
everywhere among the wreckage.

And ARNO crashes to the floor, free now.

ARNO’S P.O.V. -=

He’s lying right at Danny’s feet.

INT. HALLWAY <-

A long, narrow, hallway filled with costumes and old
backdrops. The winding corrider doglegs at its middle.

Danny and Arno creep cautiously ahead.

Two bullets clang against the wall, inches away from them.

ARNO gets out down on his hands and knees. Danny grabs his

DANNY
Wait, Arno.

He tears a grenade off his vest.

How’s your curve ball?

FARTHER DOWN THE HALLWAY --

Jules and Jim backed up by a group of Mercs. Every few
seconds, one of them reaches around the corner and fires off
another shot in the direction of Arno and Danny.

JULES and JIM run for a doorway. .
SFX -~ EXPLOSION

ARNO AND DANNY

come barreling down the hallway, right behind the explosion,

guns drawn. They lock down and see the MERCS’ dead bodies,
put no sign of The Twins.

They duck through the door and see another long haliway, which

splits into a fork. Running up the middle of the hall, side
by side, are Jules and Jin.

ARNO
The Twins!

DANNY
We've got to split them up!

Arno takes hold of the high tech archer’s bow, kneels and
zings an arrow down the long hallway.

As they reach the fork in the hall, The Twins look back...The
arrow’s coming right between their shoulders. Jules dives
left, Jim to the right, and the arrow explodes into the wall
between them.

Arno and Danny charge down the hall after. them. Danny slings
a rifle over his shoulder and cocks it. Arno takes hold of
the massive Rocket Launcher. They reach the fork, and Arno

_pulls Danny aside.

ARNO

Look, Danny, I want you to be
careful...

Be careful anyway. Try not to kill
anyone who doesn’t deserve it.

DANNY stares at hin strangely.

DANNY
You okay, Arno?

ARNO
. (quietly) Le
I'm fine. Let’s do it.
They take off down the halls; Arno to the right towards Jin
in the loading dock, and Danny to the left after Jules.

LOADING DOCK <=

An expansive Loading Dock, filled with huge crates. Arno
steps into the room quietly, watching as Jim desperately tries
to climb into an air shaft from on top of one of the crates.

ARNO
Come down from there, Jules. TI don’t
want to kill you...

JIM
I’m dim, you overgrown American
idiot.
Jim snorts and fires off a few rounds towards Arno. Arno

dcesn’t even flinch as the bullets miss by a wide margin.

ARNO
Okay, I warned you...

Arno walks over to the mountain of crates that Jim is standing
on. With a massive heave, Arno topples one of the crates,
sending the others tumbling down in a chain reaction.

MEANWHILE --

Jules is running for his life down an old studio hallway
from...

DANNY, who cackles loudly and fires a few shots off now and
then.

Jules comes to the end of the long hallway and bursts through
a doorway, outside, into an...

OLD WESTERN TOWN SET ~~

A cobwebbed, crumbling but still standing set from an old
Western, JULES stands in the middle of Main Street.

Hearing Danny coming up behind him, he darts over to THE
SALOON. i, :

As Jules pushes through the swinging doors of the Saloon, he
realizes that these are only stand up flats. He presses
himself up against the flimsy material, and peers out the
glassiess window to the street.

JULES P.O.V. <-

Danny stands in the middle of the street now. He has a big
smile on his face. He pulls the Porcelain gun off his back.

DANNY
Eenie, meenie, miney...

A HUGE EXPLOSION
blasts the saloon flat into splinters, but JULES has managed
to slip out and race across the street to the BANK.

What follows is an extremely violent cat and mouse game, as
JULES runs from the BANK, to the POST OFFICE, to the BROTHEL.
Danny blowing away each just after he starts running.

NOW, Jules is. behind the OLD JAIL set, and has no place left
to run. He tries taking a few shots at Danny, but they miss.

. DANNY
Nowhere left to run, Jules. Say your
prayers...

.

. Danny fires, and Jules is buried under a mountain ef wood.

BACK TO ARNO, IN THE LOADING DOCK -- *

He pushes away the enormous crates. Finally, he comes to
Jim’s bedy. His eyes are wide open, but his neck is twisted
hideously.

Arno shakes his head, then reaches down and shuts Jim’s eyes.
He gets up and walks out of the room.

HOLD ON JIM, for a moment, waiting for Arno to leave. As soon
as the door closes, one of his eyes POPS OPEN.

WESTERN TOWN --

Is now entirely destroyed. The outdoor set is littered with
shattered, smoldering pieces of wood. At the end of the
street, where the jail used to be, something stirs under a
mountain of rubble.

The pieces of wood start to fall aside, and rising from the
ashes is JULES...

Beaten, bloody, but still alive. He limps forward out of the
wreckage, cocking his gun.

- DANNY
(0.8)
Thought I’d left, didn’t you?:

Standing behind Jules is Danny, who hasn’t left at all, but
is in fact pointing his guh right in Jules’ back.

DANNY
Sorry Jules, I’m not that stupid.
You're the second most evil bad guy.
And the second most evil bad guy
always comes back to kill you at the
end...

Jules reaches nervously for his gun...

DANNY
Not this time...

Danny fires, blowing Jules into dust.

INT. OLD HORROR MOVIE SET -

Arno barges through a side door and on to a dusty old Horror
Movie Set of Hell. Everywhere in the room: Stalactites,
stalagmites, boulders, caverns, steel cages, and once’ ‘fiery
pits.

Arno cocks his rifle, and blows a paper mache Stalactite off
the ceiling.

Arno spins and fires off another round into the big boulder.
Plaster flies up, and clogs the air with dust.

Behind the cloud of debris, Arno makes out a figure, standing
very still. It’s ID.

MR.ID
Very impressive,” Slater. You knew
just where to look.

ARNO

Arne kicks the slats off and...

No booby trap. no surprises. Just a mother lode of drugs in
plastic bags at the bottom of the pit. Arno can’t believe Id

ON THE STUDIO GROUNDS --

Mr. Id is running for his life, looking backward over his
shoulder and then picking up the pace whenever-he hears his
name being called in the distance.

As he runs, the bandages around his face start to unravel and
flake off, leaving a trail of torn gauze in his wake.

THE CHASE leads Danny out through the studio property, up a
side street, and then on to HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.

Danny chases Id past whores, bikers, the grand, old Movie

A clenched fist unfurls. Slackened features resume their

A S tne air. He comes to his knees and
sneezes. down and sees a white bed of cocaine, his
bedy imprinted in the flakes, Arno is bleeding bad, but he’s
stiil alive.

 

The drugs must have broken his fall.
curT To:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD -

Danny keeps running, still following the trail of unraveled
gauze. Suddenly, it ends.

He looks up and realizes he’s way at the end of the strip now.
He’s standing in front of an enormous, decrepit movie theater.

The lights aze all off, the windows are boarded up. The
Marquee is missing all its letters but one; an "A" that hangs
off to one side. :

The front door looks like it’s been pried open. An old
rotting slat swings back and forth on a rusty nail.

Id went through here.

Danny smirks, raises his gun and...

BOOM!

Blows half the facade away. He steps through the smoking
wreckage into...

AN ENORMOUS THEATER LOBBY -~

The paint is dusty, peeling, chipping away, and we can barely
make: out a flame~like pattern on the walis.

DANNY
I’M COMING FOR YOU, ID!
© a
Danny hears footsteps,* and sees Id run from behind the
concessicen stand... : .
BOOH!
Danny blows it to smithereens, barely missing Id.

He chases him down the hall, then swings up and around the
aisle, into the middle of the theater.

DANNY looks up to the ceiling, then turns around. HE‘’S IN THE
MIDDLE. OF THE ASMODEUN <<

DANNY
What the hell?

This is not the Asmodeun that Danny knows, however. All but
a few scattered rows of seats have been ripped out. The
balcony is crumbling and sags in the middle. The walls are
chipped, peeling, scarred by flames...

Danny walks to the center of the theater and screams at the
top of his lungs...

DANNY
I’M GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY, ID!

His voice echoes off the walls. Danny moves up to the stage,
to the lip in front of the movie screen. He stands there,
smoking gun in hand. : :

suddenly, a light comes on from the projection booth, shining
out through the portholes. It blinds Danny and he puts his
hands up to shield his eyes.

MR. ID
Here Tam, Danny.

Id walks out on the balcony, one or two bandages remaining on
his face. He pulis them off as he walks forward, and when he
steps into the light we realize... -

It’s THE PROJECTIONIST.

PROJECTIONIST
Arno’s dead, Danny, it’s just me and
you... >

Danny’s not sure what to do...

PROJECTIONIST
Come on, Danny. Kill me. That’s
what you want, isn’t it? I killed
Arno, now shoot me and even the
score.

Danny closes his eyes and fires the gun, taking a chunk out
of the. balcony, and barely missing Id.

VOICE
(0.8.)
No!
The voice comes from a figure, standing in the lobby.

Lis
The Projectionist glances down in annoyance, and instantly,
the DOORS SLAM SHUT.

PROJECTIONIST
Here’s your chance, Danny, make up
for éverything in one shot...
He spreads his arms...

The DOORS BURST OPEN AGAIN...

VOICE
Danny, wait!

‘The VOICE nears. Danny trains his gun on the figure moving

forward through the aisles. The man stumbles; clutching his
mid section...It’s...

DANNY
AINO...

ARNO
Den‘t do it, Danny. Don’t shoot.

He’s bleeding, dying, but he’s managed to drag himself all the
way to the theater. He sits down next to front aisle.

DANNY
You’re alive...

PROJECTIONIST
I’m waiting...

. ARNO
Danny, listen to me. If you shoot
Id, it will never end. Someone else
will come after you for killing hin,
on and on, forever. You’ll be stuck
here like me, killing just to stay
alive yourself.

PROJECTIONIST
come on Danny, don’t listen to a dead
man. Go ahead and shoot, I know you
want to...

ARNG
Believe me, Danny, it’s not worth ite.
I’ve lived that way my whole life...
But you don’t have to. You can
forget all this, go back to where you

119
 

 

Danny is torn, he wants desperately te pull the trigger...

PROJECTIONIST
(growing furious}
SHOOT ME, DANNY! Take your
revenge...

Danny raises his gun, he looks like he might shoot...
Arno, his breath escaping him, crawls forward towards him...

ARNO
You won’t feel any better, Danny. It
won’t bring your father back...

4 long moment passes, both the Projectionist and Arno hang on
Danny’s next move...

Danny’s fingers tense around the gun.

THEN --

Slowly, they loosen. The gun begins to slip, and Danny lets
it fall from his hand. .

It crashes to the ground as Danny climbs down off the stage.

DANNY
Arno, come on...

ARNO
You ended it, Danny...Go home...

DANNY
ifm not leaving you here!

Danny helps Arno to his feet...

. ARNO
Forget me, I can’t go...

+ It’s over... ’
MEANWHILE <=
The Projectionist is growing furious. His eyes flame, he

seems. to grow larger on the balcony. Jets of fire spew out
from the projection room. The whole theater begins to shake.

. PROJECTIONIST
USE THE GUN, DANNY! That was the
agreement...

126
‘e

Beams fall, the walls crack...
Danny and Arno start limping forward down the aisle...

PROJECTIONIST
YOU MUST USE IT...DAMN YOU!!

The theater seats catch fire and explode, as the whole
building threatens to fold in.

Through it all, The Projectionist stands perfectly still on
his balcony, his eyes glowing red.

Danny and Arno are running now, straight for the center of the
screen. .

A long TEAR in the fabric is just visible.

The theater begins to explode behind them as DANNY hurdles the
stage thrust, leaps forward and dives... Right into the tear.

BLACKOUT

For a few moments. Then Danny plops right back down in his
original theater seat. He is unharmed, his bookbag still
slung over his shoulder.

Danny rises out of his seat, just as...

ONSCREEN ~-

A raging fire burns in the Movie! s Asmodeun, as EXTREMELY
VIOLENT‘S credits roll.

The Projectionist stands still on the balcony. His face, now
expressionless, as’ flames 1iék at him in ali directions.

He stares -out fron the screen, coldly, watching Danny.
Suddenly, the balcony collapses and he’ plummets into ‘the
burning wreckage.

HOLD ON --

DANNY’S FACE, his eyes desperately scanning the screen. But
the fire just roars higher and higher...

He turns away and walks out of the theater.

“EXT. TIMES SQUARE --

Danny pushes open the front doors to the Asmodeun and steps

12h
‘e

 

eo

out bathed in the gray-yellow light that

comes

 

He stands juSt outside the theater for a moment. His eyes are
blank, expressionless. He closes them for a second.

EIGHTH AVENUE --

Danny trudges up Eighth Avenue, his hands thrust in his
pockets, trying to keep warm in the early morning chill.

He picks up his pace, until he is no longer walking but
running, soaring past sex shops and porno theaters and sleazy
go-go bars whose doors have finally closed.

He comes to the subway and bounds down the steps.

INT. SUBWAY CAR -- A FEW MINUTES LATER

Light all but disappears as the car roars into a tunnel, then
reappears as it comes out again, overground.

Danny stares out the window, trying to find his destination
in the small family homes and industrial parks that make up
the borough of Queens.

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN QUEENS -~

Danny is running again, his chest heaving as he races towards
his destination...

A large, sprawling graveyard. The intended tranquility is
drowned out by the zooming of traffic on the super-highways
ringing the lawns.

‘EXT. THE GRAVEYARD --

Danny wanders through the sea of white gravestones until he
finds the one he’s looking for.

HIS FATHER’S GRAVE --
He stands in front of the grave, staring at it.
HOLD ON -- HIS EYES

still dry, stili cold. He just stands there, not knowing what
to do. . :

He turns to walk away, then falls to his knees. The sobs come
slowly at first, then harder and harder until he is short of
breath from crying.

122
A HAND reaches out and touches his shoulder. He locks up to
see HIS MOTHER, standing over him, tears in her eyes as well.

DANNY
Mom...

She kneels on the ground, taking him into her arms.

HOLD ON -- THE TWO OF THEM

in the sea of gravestones. The morning sun has just peaked
out over the smog and grime of New York City.

THEN DISSOLVE INTO:

INT. THE ASMODEUN --

The ROWS OF EMPTY SEATS in the Asmodeun. All is still in the
theater now, the projector shines a white light across the
theater, the clack of the film unspooling can be heard in the
background. .

Slowly, a hand comes up over the first row of seats. Then an
arm, followed by a muscular torso. Then the rest of...

ARNO SLATER. He rises to his feet. 2

He is unscratched, no bloodstains, his clothes are clean. He
steps forward down the aisle.

He walks through the lobby and out of the theater, into...
THE.MIDDLE OF NEW YORK’S BUSTLING TIMES SQUARE

o
He smiles broadly. As he walks down the street, he passes a
garbage can.

He pauses for a second, then takes his gun out, his prized
Beretta with the laser sighting, and drops it in the garbage
can.

Arno walks on, seeing the world around him as though for the
first time...Like a man born into life full grown.
