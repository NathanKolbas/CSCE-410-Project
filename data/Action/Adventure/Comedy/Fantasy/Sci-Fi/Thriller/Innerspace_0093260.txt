INT. HOTEL BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT
A crowded cocktail party is in progress. Open bar and huge
buffet table. A well-dressed, predominantly male crowd in
attendance. Uniforms from all branches of the military are
in evidence everywhere.
CAMERA PROWLS THROUGH the room picking up random bits of
conversation. A TELEVISION NEWS CREW, reporting live from
the scene, comes INTO FRAME.

The busboy looks baffled, and Tuck moves off with his
dignity intact. Noticing that his glass is empty, he
shoulders his way to the bar.
TUCK
(to bartender)
Cutty. Up.
As he waits for his drink, we see that Tuck's rugged good
looks are fading slightly and his once square jaw is in
need of a closer shave. His Navy captain's uniform -stretched tightly across his chest -- suggests that
several pounds have been added since the last fitting.
As Tuck receives his drink from the bartender, a DISTURBANCE is heard to break out somewhere across the room:
ROVING EYES
(to Lydia; loudly)
What are you doing!? That's a tape
recorder!
Roving Eyes indicates a small Sony protruding from Lydia's
clutch purse.

You can't do that, young lady!
Give that to me.
He swipes the recorder from her purse.

Hey!

ROVING EYES
This is a cocktail party, not a

LYDIA
(firmly)
Give it back to me, please.
TUCK
You heard the lady... hand it over!
Roving Eyes looks startled by Tuck's abusive tone.
TUCK
I said, hand it over... ya damn
pencil-necked civilian!
Suddenly, the room falls silent, and Tuck realizes that
all eyes are upon him.
ROVING EYES
Captain, you're drunk.
Tuck looks embarrassed. He looks down at his drink, then
looks up again with a big, foolish grin on his face.
TUCK
Well... he's right. I'm drunk.
(to Lydia)
Guess I owe these folks an
apology, Lydia.
She puts her hand on his arm.
LYDIA
(softly)
It's okay, Tuck. Forget it.
Tuck pulls away from her.
TUCK
(belligerently)
Not until I apologize to these
people!
(for all to hear)
We got some real famous, allAmerican hero-types with us
tonight! Space-walkers, an' moonwalkers... an' Earth-orbiters!
It's obvious who Tuck is talking about. They stand there
in their crisp uniforms, with short hair, erect postures
and disapproving expressions.
TUCK
Gentlemen...

... I'm sorry...

Rusty looks enraged. He advances toward Tuck. But Tuck
stands his ground -- smiles -- and drops Rusty with a
hooking right fist. Uproar!
TWO young MARINES rush up to Tuck.
FIRST MARINE
Take it easy, Captain.
TUCK
Only two of you?
Tuck raises his fists. The Marines exchange a look.
They know that they have no alternative.

Sorry, Captain.
Pow! Tuck takes it on the chin. He goes tumbling backwards into the rocket display. The MODELS BANG into each

Tuck props himself up on one elbow and works his jaw.
Lydia rushes to his side.
LYDIA
Oh, Tuck... are you all right?
Tuck gives her a dazed expression. No one else offers
assistance. They look upon Tuck as a complete disgrace.
Then, one man comes forward. Dressed in a business suit.
Tuck's own age. Clean cut. Athletic-looking. His name
is PETE BLANCHARD. He offers Tuck his hand.
Tuck looks up at Blanchard and smiles sadly.

Blanchard pulls Tuck to his feet.
BLANCHARD

Lydia begins to lead Tuck away. But she leaves his side
for a brief moment to snatch back her tape recorder from
Roving Eyes' unsuspecting hands.
LYDIA

The Intruder smiles to himself and unleashes a FUSILLADE

INSIDE THE DOME
Ozzie flinches as the Plexiglass dome begins to disintegrate under the BARRAGE of GUNFIRE. Shattered pieces rain
down on him. He crouches behind the big microscope for
protection.
Then, glancing up at the hypodermic syringe under the
microscope's lens, he makes a decision: He grabs the
syringe, kicks open the dome's hatchway, and makes a dash
for it.

57

OUTSIDE DOME
Ozzie emerges on the side away from the Intruders. They
don't see him. He stays low, holding a handkerchief to
his nose and mouth, darts between a few large pieces of
equipment, and escapes.
The Intruders, meanwhile, have the Technicians lined up
before them. They regard their captors with dopey, bewildered expressions; swaying drunkenly from side to
side.
An Intruder takes the videotape camera from one of the
Techs.
TECH
Who are you?...
INTRUDER

The Tech looks confused. He makes an effort to understand;
to focus his eyes. And slowly, the Intruder transforms
for him into:

Igoe doesn't even flinch. He just looks down at his hand.
All five fingers are caught in the tightly closed door.

Igoe and his Henchmen turn and run back toward the Black Sedan.
Igoe gets there first. He doesn't bother to wait for the

He then looks around, wrestles a bicycle away from an OLD
CHINAMAN and pedals off in pursuit of Jack.

Jack emerges from the rest room and approaches the table.
We see JACK'S POV as he moves toward Lydia.
Lydia looks up -- then registers alarm. She rises from
her chair and draws what appears to be a gun from her
purse and takes aim -- seemingly at Jack.

The dart penetrates the plastic name tag, melting it instantly
and releasing half its charge with a loud BUZZZZ!
The other 2,500 volts enter Jack's body, and Jack goes limp
in Igoe's arms.

TUCK - INSIDE THE POD

ribbons of electric current dance around the contours of the
Pod. Tuck is SLAMMED back into his seat as electricity
courses through his limbs.

The Pod's lights dim, then brighten once again. But Tuck is
left a shaken man. His hair sticks straight up in current
Punker fashion, and his head glows from within like a

Tuck's consciousness returns, when the Pod is suddenly
turned upside down as...

like a sack of flour.
Igoe runs from the restaurant amid an UPROAR of YELLING

As Igoe runs off, the FERRARI KEYS slip from Jack's pocket
and fall to the floor. Lydia sees this and snatches them up.

249

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT - DAY
Igoe runs down the alley with Jack over his shoulder. Jack
begins to snap out of it. He can't imagine where he is or
why he's being conveyed this way. (We also see that he, too,
sports an electrified Punk hairdo.)
Igoe notices a DELIVERY TRUCK pulling away from a loading dock.
He's able to pop open the cargo doors and throw Jack inside.
But now the truck is driving away. Igoe runs alongside of it.
It begins to pick up speed. Igoe keeps up with it, leaps onto
a running board, throws open the cab door, yanks out the
driver and takes his place behind the wheel.
The truck THUNDERS down the alley at top speed.

TUCK - INSIDE THE POD
Is grateful to see his instruments come back on line. The Pod
is righted once again, its speed and direction under control.
TUCK

Scrimshaw climbs into the truck. One of the Henchmen thoughtfully throws a huge fur coat over Scrimshaw's shoulders,
making him look even more formidable than before.
Snowflakes cling to Jack's eyelashes as he looks up at
the towering Scrimshaw.
Scrimshaw looks down at Jack impassively, then calls off:

Dr. Margaret Canker sweeps out of the limo and is helped

Canker whips out a stethoscope and checks Jack's chest.

Canker clears her throat.
CANKER

Miniaturization works on a dual-chip
system. We have one chip in our
possession at this moment. We will
have the other one shortly.
Scrimshaw anticipates an angry reaction from Jack -- but
doesn't get one.
Fine.

JACK
I'll take what you've got.

Canker and Scrimshaw exchange a look.
CANKER

You do understand, the first chip

JACK
Right. We'll whet their appetites

SCRIMSHAW
Good point.

Jack and the enemy chopper are engaged in a nasty dogfight.
The Henchman FIRES at Jack's chopper with his automatic
rifle. Somehow, Jack is able to maneuver out of the line
of fire.

INT. THE STOMACH
A dogfight of a different kind rages here. Both Pods dart
around the stomach, shooting LASER BEAMS at each other.
A stray laser beam hits the stomach wall, burning a small
hole in it.

INT. THE CHOPPER
Jack winces and grabs his stomach.
LYDIA
Are you all right!?
Then: The enemy chopper comes up right beside Jack.
The Henchman inside levels his automatic weapon, but
before he can fire --

A HUEY-COBRA U.S. MILITARY HELICOPTER
THUNDERS out of the clouds like a bad dream and FIRES a
heat-seeking missile. The missile SCREAMS across the
skies and hits the enemy chopper.
It EXPLODES in a ball of fire and evaporates into dust.

The interior of the Black Pod is being rapidly eaten

Tuck's Pod locates the chip at the opening of the intestine, *

Tuck's Pod sails by, pushing the enormous chip before it.
Igoe waits for the right moment -- then grabs hold of
Tuck's Pod. He clings on tightly, crawls to the top and
pries open the hatch with his fingers.

Igoe so hard that his arm sinks into Igoe's body clear up
to his elbow!
Tuck looks horrified.
He pulls his arm out. And with it, much of Igoe's inner
workings: Wires, circuits, relays, diodes, switches. They
all come tumbling out in one big tangled, HUMMING, heap.
TUCK
An android!
Igoe begins to short-circuit. Smoke billows out from all
the openings in his body. A HISSING noise. SPARKING WIRES.
Then, Igoe erupts into flames.

Tuck jumps back.

Flames shrivel and melt the "skin" on Igoe's chest, and
the heart-shaped tattoo with Margaret's name in the center
begins to perish.

Igoe is melting right before his eyes and the pod is filling

Tuck goes to the nose of the pod and tries to pull out

Several Technicians and Infantrymen come forward, but
Tuck warns them back.

They jump away. Finally, Tuck pulls the module free and
he dives for safety.
