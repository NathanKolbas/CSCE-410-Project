THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME

FIRST DRAFT
August 2016
EXT. EASTERN EUROPE - OUTDOOR MARKET - DAWN

 

A MAN -- rugged, square chin, hasn’t slept or shaven in days.
This is DREW THAYER (30s). He wears a thick coat, tries not
to stand out. He’s not from around here.

“Here” is a bleak, locals-only market surrounded by crumbling
Soviet-era buildings. Anemic vegetables. Dried meat. Fish.
Handmade woolens. This place isn’t in a Lonely Planet guide.

VILNIUS, LITHUANIA

Drew shouldn’t be out in public but he needs to eat. He
glances around furtively as he buys a ROLL from a BAKER.

DREW
(Lithuanian)
Thank you.

He sees something in his periphery -- his gears turn -- knows
he'll have to run. Or fight. Probably both. He crosses to --

A table of sad Chernobyl-looking shit manned by a skinny
LITTLE GIRL -- bootleg Snoopy alarm clock, filthy handmade
dolls -- one man’s trash... Drew picks up a HAND MIRROR.

LITTLE GIRL
(broken English)
Three Euro.

Drew ignores her, uses the mirror to look behind him -- at a
FLOWER STAND there’s a THUG. Shaved head. Flat nose from
repeated breaks. The kind of man who’d never buy you flowers.

LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
(broken English)
Two? I give you for two.

Drew puts the mirror down and walks away.

LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
One-fifty... ?

EXT. WOOLEN STAND - CONTINUOUS

Colorful clothes sway as Drew slips behind them. The THUG
appears... looks around... Then suddenly -- a STRIPED SCARF
ensnares his neck. Tightens, tightens -- Thug gasps for air.

Drew’s behind him -- he’s done this before -- Thug kicks,
knocks over a table of mittens -- The AGING VENDOR SCREAMS.

Then it’s over. Thug goes LIMP. Drew holds him by the waist
with one hand, swiftly reaches the other to his belt. Pulls
out Thug’s HANDGUN and lets the dead body fall into a PUDDLE.
VENDOR
(Lithuanian)
Savages! You pay for this mess!

As Drew drops a stack of Euros onto her table...

ANOTHER GUY jumps out. Probably his brother. Bigger -- if
that’s possible. Drew FIRES -- but his target’s ready for it
and dives behind a BUTCHER’S STAND. Drew FIRES again... most
of the bullets hit SALAMI. But his last bullet HITS the guy’s
CHEST. He falls. Drew calmly moves in to finish the job.

Click. Gun’s empty. Fuck.

As the guy gasps for life, goes for his own gun -- Drew yanks
down a SALAMI, smacks the guy’s hand with it -- a makeshift
bat -- then leaps onto his chest. With one hand, Drew holds

the guy’s nose -- with the other, shoves the jagged, broken
SALAMI DOWN THE GUY'S THROAT. Bad way to die. But at least
there’s no one coming after him now.

Wait. Spoke too soon. From around the corner, a MAN with a
horrible 1994 haircut comes at Drew -- GUN BLASTING. Drew
DUCKS. He WEAVES. Drew dives around the corner, disappearing.
The GUNFIRE keeps coming...

INT. BARCADE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The GUNFIRE now comes from DUCK HUNT -- the old Nintendo

game. We’re in a retro arcade-themed bar and the shooter of

the ORANGE PLASTIC HANDGUN is AUDREY. She turns 27 today. She

decimates duck after duck, insanely good at this game.

Unlike every female character in every other movie, Audrey

knows exactly how beautiful she is. Like a 7. Maybe an 8 if

she wasn’t wearing her tacky Hawaiian TRADER JOE’S UNIFORM.
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

MORGAN (27), her best friend, walks over with TWO BEERS.

MORGAN
You can’t stand over here all night.

Morgan’s parents always told her she could be anything,
including a rocket scientist or a supermodel, if she wanted.
Morgan totally buys that. Girl has zero insecurities.

AUDREY
Why? I’m having a good time.

MORGAN
Because it’s your birthday party.

Behind Audrey: some FRIENDS, a half-eaten supermarket cake.
AUDREY

Right. And for my birthday, I want

to stand in the corner and not talk
to anyone who isn’t caught up on my
life. Everyone’s gonna ask me what

I’m up to cause that’s what you do,
and I’1ll have to tell everyone that
I’m not up to anything.

MORGAN
Audrey...

AUDREY
Look at me. I’m twenty-seven years
old and I work at Trader Joe’s. I
wear a Hawaiian shirt to work and I
am neither Hawaiian nor Jimmy
Buffett. Like, three years ago what
I’m doing was considered “finding
myself.” Now I’m suddenly at the
age where people feel bad for me
for doing the exact same thing.

MORGAN
Who feels bad for you? I’1l kill
them.

AUDREY
My parents called today. They spent
five seconds saying happy birthday,
and the next forty-five minutes
bragging about how my brother Adam
is about to cure Cystic Fibrosis.

MORGAN
Fuck Cystic Fibrosis.

AUDREY
Actually, it’s a really serious
disease. Adam has a huge heart.
(sighing)
And everyone’s gonna ask about Drew.

MORGAN
Fuck Drew. That guy was a dick.

AUDREY
You're just saying that to make me
feel better. You never said that
when we were together.

MORGAN
Well yeah. You can’t say shit about
your friend’s current boyfriend.
But dude, he dumped you in a text.
Objectively, he suuuucks.
AUDREY
Or he just wasn’t in love with me.

MORGAN
Audrey, you control the narrative
here. It’s all about spin. Look at
me. Am I successful? Not in the
conventional sense of being like,
employed. But ask me what I'm doing
with my life.

AUDREY
What?

MORGAN
Say, hey Morgan, what have you been
up to lately?

AUDREY
(flat)
Hey Morgan. What have you been up
to lately?
MORGAN

Getting in touch with my gifts.
Voice lessons. Stage combat. So no
matter what roles come along in
theater, film, or life’s journey
itself, I'm ready. It's a beautiful
thing as a woman to empower
yourself like that, you know?

AUDREY
Okay that was amazing.

MORGAN
Hey, do I have your e-mail? My one
woman show is really coming together.

TESS (27) walks in. She’s anorexic, personality-free and a
huge cunt. (We’re taking back that word, sorry!)

AUDREY
Shit. It’s Tess. Don’t make me talk
to Tess. She’s gonna do that thing
she always does, where she gives me
a bullshit compliment then pivots
it into something super insulting.

MORGAN
Audrey. Spin. You got this. Here...

She hands Audrey a tube of lipstick.
MORGAN (CONT'D)
Put this on. Tell the world you’re
trying. Ideally, you’d change out
of your work clothes too but...

Morgan walks away. Tess is now next to Audrey.

TESS
Hey lady! Oh my God, those earrings
are so cute! Are those shells?

AUDREY
Yeah...

TESS
Where’s your adorable boyfriend? You
guys are such a surprising couple!

Audrey just... can’t. She takes the plastic gun from the
game, puts it to her OWN TEMPLE. Pulls the trigger and
dramatically FAKE DIES. Tess has no idea how to react.

EXT. VILNIUS ALLEY - DAY

Drew runs down stairs down to a rusty basement door. It’s
locked. Drew turns, sprints back to an overflowing DUMPSTER.

He grabs a busted HAIR DRYER. This’1ll do. He bashes it on the
ground til the innards are exposed. Yanks out a HEATING COIL.

BACK AT THE DOOR -- Drew picks the lock with the coil. He’s
fast. Walks in like he owns the place.

INT. BASEMENT OF LITHUANIAN BROTHEL - DAY

A tall LATEX-CLAD DOMINATRIX clicks a REMOTE CONTROL. Across
the room: a MAN suspended from a harness wearing only
underwear, tattoos and piercings -- his nipples hooked up to
electrodes. He screams in pain/gratification.

Nonplussed, Drew brushes past -- grabs a WHIP, CHAINS, and a
SPIKED COLLAR for later use. He shoves them into his jacket.

INT. LITHUANIAN BROTHEL - DAY

Upstairs, WOMEN IN LINGERIE work the early-morning shift. You
could catch herpes just by looking at them. Drew emerges and

the ANCIENT MADAM approaches, cigarette dangling. Drew hands

her a wad of cash. He’s done this before.

MADAM
(Lithuanian)
Which one?

Drew points to a young, thin, SPOOKED GIRL. She nods. Drew
takes the spooked girl’s hand and she leads him upstairs.
INT. BROTHEL - UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Drew closes the door behind them. The girl starts to take off
her clothes, speaks in Broken English.

DREW
No. Keep them on.

Drew pulls the SPIKED COLLAR out of his jacket. The Girl is
terrified. But Drew crosses to the WINDOW, opens it.

GIRL
What you into?

DREW
(Lithuanian)
I’m into you never saw me.

With that, Drew hands her more money than she’s ever seen in
her life ($25 USD). Then turns the COLLAR upside down and
loops it over the POWER LINE out the window. He jumps out.

EXT. BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS

Drew ZIPLINES out of the brothel, over rooftops, and finally
jumps off on a LANDING outside the open window of a --

INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

TWO BORED TEENAGERS watch THE MINDY PROJECT dubbed in
Lithuanian. They barely look up as Drew runs past them --

INT. RAMSHACKLE HOUSE - KITCHEN

The MATRIARCH ladles BORSCHT from a pot. Seeing Drew, she
SCREAMS and drops it, Pepto Bismol pink everywhere. SIRENS
WAIL in the distance.

DREW
(Lithuanian)
Keys.

EXT. VILNIUS ROAD - MINUTES LATER

Drew whizzes down a COBBLESTONE STREET on a MOPED. TWO COP
CARS round the corner, in hot pursuit.

INT. BARCADE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Morgan sits at the bar, flirting with Eurotrash VIKTOR --
shaved head, Ukrainian football tracksuit.

MORGAN
Such a coincidence. I just
auditioned to be a Ukrainian farm
girl in a Geico spot. Wait, so is
it "Ukraine" or “The Ukraine?"
VIKTOR
You say how you like. Always let
beautiful woman decide.

Morgan swoons... then notices Audrey, head pressed mournfully
against the JUKEBOX. Draining her SCOTCH. She puts it on top
of the juke next to TWO OTHER EMPTIES. Morgan grimaces.

MORGAN
Hey, Viktor? Hold that thought.

Morgan crosses to Audrey.

AUDREY
Why did I have my birthday here?
This is where I met Drew.

MORGAN
Enough. After tonight, I never want
to hear the name “Drew” again. Even
if you, like, “drew” me a picture,
you say “I painted you something
with pencils.” You have to move on.

AUDREY
I know. It’s just kinda hard to do
that when he left that box of shit
in our apartment that I have to see
every day. He won’t even text me
back about picking it up.

MORGAN
Let me see your phone for a sec.

Audrey hands her CELL over. Morgan finds the BREAKUP TEXT.
“Hey there -- it’s over. Sorry.”

Morgan then scrolls through a series of UNANSWERED REPLIES
from Audrey: Why / What are you... / Call me / WIF? / How can
you... Then she starts a NEW TEXT MESSAGE.

AUDREY
Who are you texting?

MORGAN
Drew. “Fuck you, you worthless pussy
-- I’m setting your shit on fire.”

AUDREY
Why are you saying that?

MORGAN
Because we’re gonna go set his
fucking shit on fire. I love
setting things on fire.
EXT. VILNIUS SLUMS - DAY

Drew speeds through the decrepit, graffitied streets, ona
mission. He parks behind a burnt out APARTMENT COMPLEX.

He looks at his cell -- GRIMACES. Then rounds the corner and
sees something worse -- Three GIANT THUGS waiting for him.

Drew takes the long way around the building, stealthily
pulling the WHIP and CHAINS from his jacket. He rounds the
corner -- now behind the men -- and just STARTS SWINGING. In
seconds, all three men are bloody messes. Two knocked out,
the other moaning in pain. Drew steps over them.

INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN’S FIRE ESCAPE - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

 

Typical L.A. stucco fourplex. Audrey and Morgan stand
drunkenly on the fire escape over a BANKERS BOX of Drew’s
stuff. Morgan holds a bottle of LIGHTER FLUID. Audrey
gingerly picks up a pair of BOXER BRIEFS.

AUDREY
Really Drew? Skid marks on your
underwear? Are you eight? Was I
supposed to wash this for you? Is
that why you dumped me? I didn’t
mother you enough?

MORGAN
Fuck you and wipe your own ass!

Next, Audrey picks up a small PLASTIC TROPHY shaped like a
VICTORIOUS FOOTBALL PLAYER. The plaque reads: SECOND PLACE.

AUDREY
Your Fantasy Football trophy for
SECOND place? And you saved it?

MORGAN
It’s not even real football. It’s a
fucking fantasy.

AUDREY
And I'm a real fucking person. So
if you think you’re gonna get some
supermodel who also has nothing
better to do with her time than
blow you while you watch the
game... uh, fuck you.

Morgan pulls out a STRAIGHT TO DVD SPY ACTION MOVIE.

MORGAN
Um, speaking of fantasy, say
goodbye to your straight-to-DVD
shitty action movie starring Ryan
Phillipe and Mischa Barton!
AUDREY
That you forced me to watch with
you. I will never get those 82
minutes back. There’s like one
review on the cover. Three and a
half stars from
JeffreyLovesMovies.com?!

MORGAN
And you got it used at Chevron?
Really Drew? You walked into a gas
station and you’re like, yes! One
copy of “Marked Target” please.
Here’s $3.99.

Morgan pours LIGHTER FLUID all over the box and its contents.
She hands Audrey a matchbox.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
You do the honors, birthday girl.

Audrey takes the matches. We’re CLOSE on the MATCH
LIGHTING... and then... BUZZ. Her cell, in her pocket.

Audrey shakes out the match and pulls out her phone...

AUDREY
It’s... Drew.

DREW (V.0.)
Hey.

INT. DREW’S SHITTY VILNIUS APARTMENT - INTERCUT
Not a place you’d want to spend the night in. Peeling walls,

roaches, bare light bulb. Drew paces, earpiece in, checking
the SURVEILLANCE SCREENS by his bed.

AUDREY
Really? That’s it? “Hey?”
DREW
Audrey, I'm so sorry. I fucked up.
MORGAN
Tell him to go fuck himself.
DREW
I'll come by your place tomorrow. I
can explain everything... and I’1l
get the stuff I left there.
AUDREY
(annoyed)

So that’s why you called? Just to
get your shit back? Awesome.
10.

She awaits a response. But Drew’s busy PUNCHING THE DRYWALL
by his night stand. In the hole: a SECRET STASH of MONEY,
PASSPORTS and GUNS. Drew stuffs it in his POCKETS.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
It’s my birthday, by the way.

Drew hears a GUN COCK. Someone’s behind him.
ON AUDREY: The line goes DEAD.
ON DREW -- spinning around -- knocking the gun from his
attacker, an OLDER THUG. They know each other. No weapons
now. They punch and kick, equally matched.
OLDER THUG

Fight me all you want but you have

more problems coming. You know what

they want.

DREW
They’re not getting it.

OLDER THUG
They’11 get it when you’re dead.

DREW
I can handle dead. Can you?

Drew PINS the old thug to the floor with one hand. CRACKS HIS
NECK with the other. Drew shakes off the body and moves to --

THE KITCHENETTE

Drew pulls a bag of MICROWAVE POPCORN from an almost-bare
cupboard. Then, from the hole in the wall, delicately --

A BRICK OF C-4

Drew affixes it to the bag of NEWMAN’S OWN (in Cyrillic),
tosses it in the microwave, presses the POPCORN SETTING. The
popcorn STARTS POPPING...

EXT. STREETS OF VILNIUS - MOMENTS LATER

Drew walks away from his building as his apartment EXPLODES.
In the flames, our title:

THE SPY WHO DUMPED ME

INT. BARCADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A year ago. Audrey, happier, before her heartbreak. She’s at
the jukebox, flipping. She’s lightly bumped on the back.

DREW (0.S.)
Sorry.
11.

Audrey turns, notices DREW behind her. Back then he was clean-
shaven, like any guy you’d see in a Silver Lake bar.

AUDREY
That’s okay.

Audrey’s wears a “HAPPY BIRTHDAY” PARTY STORE TIARA.

DREW
Oh. Hey. Happy birthday.

AUDREY
What?
(off tiara, deadpan)
Oh, this? It’s not my birthday. I
just wear this for warmth.

DREW
Well, if it was your birthday, I
would say happy birthday.

AUDREY
And I would say thank you.

A moment. They’re clearly feeling a vibe.
AUDREY (CONT’D)

Hey, can I get your help with
something really really important?

DREW
I do consider myself a problem-
solver.

AUDREY

I have one quarter left. Your
mission, should you choose to
accept it, is to find the absolute
worst song on this jukebox.

Drew smiles, joins her.

INT. TRADER JOE'S - DAY (PRESENT)

Audrey snaps out of the memory, hands a CUSTOMER a RECEIPT.
She’s at her shitty CASHIER JOB at Trader Joe’s.

AUDREY
Thank you. Have a great day.

Audrey notices her reflection in a MIRROR by the register.
She looks hung over. Remembering Morgan’s words, she pulls
out the LIPSTICK and applies it. Almost immediately --

SEBASTIAN HENSHAW (30) -- shirt, tie, charming, British --
steps to her register. With NO GROCERIES. Audrey’s confused.
12.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
Can I help you?

SEBASTIAN
Yes... one gum please.

He hastily grabs the nearest pack of GUM and hands her a
dollar. As Audrey rings him up.

AUDREY
Have a nice day.

SEBASTIAN
...Sebastian. Aren’t you going to
ask me if I need help to my car?
Audrey smiles. He’s flirting with her. Well, look at that.
EXT. TRADER JOE'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Audrey follows Sebastian to a far corner of the parking lot.

AUDREY
So, where are you from?
SEBASTIAN
England.
AUDREY

That’s what I thought. But
sometimes when I think that, people
end up being Australian.

SEBASTIAN
(amused)
People do sometimes end up being
Australian.

AUDREY
Shut up.
(then, flustered)
Sorry, I didn’t really mean shut
up. It’s a figure of speech. I
dunno if you do that in England...

SEBASTIAN
Figures of speech? We invented that.

AUDREY
Some would say I’m not exercising
good judgment, following a strange
man through a parking lot. I mean,
this is how people get shoved into
the back of sketchy vans, right?
13.

SEBASTIAN
(dead serious)
Get in the van.

AUDREY
What?

REVEAL Sebastian’s stopping in front of a BLACK VAN with
TINTED WINDOWS. The DOOR OPENS from the inside. Sebastian
flashes a BADGE.

SEBASTIAN
Federal agent.

INT. VAN - DAY

The van moves. Sebastian faces Audrey. Next to him is TOPHER
PATEL (30) -- a smarmy jerk. Audrey is beyond freaked out.

AUDREY
What's going on? Am I in trouble? I
didn't do anything wrong.

SEBASTIAN
There’s nothing to be afraid of,
Ms. Stockman.

AUDREY
Says the guy who just kidnapped me.
And knows my name. Oh my God what
the fuck is happening... ?

PATEL
We just want to talk. About Drew
Thayer. He's your boyfriend, right?

AUDREY
(surprised)
No. I mean he was. But we broke up.
Why? Is he in trouble or something?

PATEL
Yes. Drew is in a lot of trouble.

SEBASTIAN
Do you know where your ex-boyfriend
worked, Ms. Stockman?

AUDREY
Yeah. NPR. He has this podcast
about... um, honestly, I’m not

positive. The episode I listened to
was about little-known composers of
the 18th Century... well, I
listened to most of it.
14.

PATEL
Nobody listened to that podcast.
Not even me and I went to Harvard.

SEBASTIAN
Wow. Only took you two minutes.
(flat)
Patel went to Harvard.

PATEL
That podcast was Drew’s cover job.

AUDREY
He never said anything about having
another job.

PATEL
That’s what “cover” means, hon.
AUDREY
Okay I know. I’m not stupid. I’m
just... processing. This is a lot.

What was it a cover for?

SEBASTIAN
Drew was a CIA agent.

AUDREY
Wait, what?!

SEBASTIAN
Then he stole things he shouldn’t
have and killed people he shouldn't
have. Now he’s on the run.

PATEL
And if we don’t find him, a lot of
innocent people are going to die.
Do you want that to happen?

AUDREY
No! Jesus. No. Look, I’m with you
that Drew’s an asshole. I just
can't believe he’s... a killer.

Sebastian pulls out a FOLDER of PHOTOS. Grainy surveillance
pictures of Drew -- with guns, making a drop, stabbing a man
in the neck. Audrey gets more anxious as she flips through.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Oh my God. OH MY GOD.

She stops at a photo of HERSELF with DREW, in VEGAS.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
You guys were in Vegas when we saw
Celine Dion?

(MORE )
15.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
(quickly)
Ironically.

He hands her another photo. TWO DEAD BODIES by a CRAPS TABLE.

PATEL
Has Drew been in touch since you
broke up?

ON AUDREY - should she tell them?

AUDREY

No... well, yes. He called me last
night. I mean, he called me back.
Finally. I had called him like a
thousand times.

(self-conscious)
After he disappeared. I called him
a normal amount when we were
together. I'm normal.

INT. AUDREY’S APARTMENT - DAY

An Ikea-filled two-bedroom. Audrey rushes in, still in her
uniform (she’1l continue to be until we say otherwise.)

AUDREY
Morgan! Morgan!

Morgan emerges from the kitchen in her bra and underwear, mid-
phone call. Peeling and eating string cheese.

MORGAN
...Yeah, Mom. Audrey just got home.

AUDREY
I have to talk to you.

MORGAN
Dude, I have to talk to you. I
slept with Viktor.

AUDREY
Who?

MORGAN
From your birthday party.

Behind her, Viktor emerges in nothing but RED LYCRA BRIEFS.
He kisses Morgan intensely, then grabs a sleeve of CRACKERS.

VIKTOR
I will hit shower, yes?

He heads into the bathroom. The shower runs.
16.

MORGAN

(into phone)
What? Sorry, Mom, I’m kind of ina
sex haze...

(beat)
Hmm. I don’t know, I’11 ask her.
Audrey, have you ever been with an
uncircumcised guy?

AUDREY
Morgan!

MORGAN
Audrey thinks I tell you guys too
much... I know! I think it’s

healthy too. But yeah, I know most
European guys are uncircumcised.
Like when I first saw it I was
like, ew this looks like an unbaked
crescent roll. But then it’s like
when it’s in there, the whole thing
expands and it feels like -- I know
this doesn’t sound like it would
feel good -- but it’s like your
insides are covered in scotch tape.
Wait, duh, you already know this,
Mom. You did a year abroad.

AUDREY
MORGAN HANG UP THE FUCKING PHONE!

MORGAN
I’1l call you back.
(hangs up)
Jesus. What?

AUDREY
These guys from the CIA came to
Trader Joe’s today. To talk about
Drew. They said... he's a spy.

Morgan cracks up, assuming she’s kidding.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
I'm serious. They showed me
pictures of him with like, weapons
and dead bodies. People he killed.

MORGAN
Wait. What?!

AUDREY
I know it sounds fucking batshit.
But think about it. There were just
so many unanswered questions with
that guy...
17.

MORGAN
Yeah there were. Like if he really
went to Vassar, why does he
pronounce it Liberry?
(then)
Oh my fucking God!

AUDREY
Thank you! That is the appropriate
reaction!

MORGAN
No. Behind you!

Audrey turns. DREW is on the fire escape, wresting the window
open. He smiles. Ugh. It's a charming fucking smile.

DREW
Hey.
AUDREY
(reeling)
Hi...
DREW

So you have my stuff?

AUDREY
Yeah...

Then Audrey snaps out of it, remembers how angry she’s been.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Wait, that’s all you have to say?
What happened to you explaining
everything?

DREW
I will, just right now I’m ina
rush. Where’s the stuff? Your room?
He just heads for her room. Audrey follows, pissed off.

AUDREY
Stop. You can’t just go in there.

INT. AUDREY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Audrey walks in to find Drew grabbing THE BOX on the floor.
She shuts the door behind him. They share a silent look.

AUDREY
Hey. Asshole. We’re not together.
There are like, rules.
18.

DREW
(re: the box)
This smells like lighter fluid.

AUDREY
Yeah. I wasn’t kidding when I said
I was gonna burn your shit.

But Drew just keeps moving, back to...
INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Audrey follows Drew as he heads back to the window. This is
all happening so fast. But it’s her last chance to say it...

AUDREY
I know you’re a spy.

This finally stops Drew. His face drops. He turns around.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
People from the CIA came to my work.
They made me get in a van and showed
me pictures of people you killed.

DREW
What did you tell them?

AUDREY
You're not gonna give me a bullshit
excuse about how this is a joke your
coworkers are playing on you? And
those pictures were photoshopped?

DREW
Audrey...

AUDREY
It was fucking scary, Drew.

Drew is PANICKED. Checks windows, behind doors, opens the
closet. Then, he pulls a HANDGUN out of his jacket.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Jesus! Fuck.

DREW
Audrey. Listen to me. I need to
know exactly what you told them.

AUDREY
(confused)
What’s on your head?

DREW
What?
19.

AUDREY
You have a red dot on your head.

Sure enough, there’s a LASER SIGHT right between Drew's eyes.

GUNSHOTS -- BANG -- shattering windows. Drew springs to
action, SHOVES AUDREY behind the COUCH -- pulls them both
down and holds her close. It’s weirdly intimate.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
What the fuck is going on?

Then she sees the BLOOD. Drew’s been shot twice in the CHEST.
But he’s ALIVE. Audrey GASPS--

INT. MORGAN’S BEDROOM - SAME
Morgan is still on the phone again as she gets dressed.

MORGAN
What the fuck was that?!
(then)
Dad, I have to call you back.

INT. AUDREY AND MORGAN’S LIVING ROOM - SAME
BEHIND THE SOFA. GUNFIRE doesn’t let up. Drew speaks, urgent.

DREW
Audrey... bad people are after me--

AUDREY
The CIA guys?

DREW
There’s more than just the CIA
chasing me. And now they’re after
you too. Fuck. This is exactly what
I didn’t want -- you in danger.
That’s why I broke up with you.

Before Audrey can respond, Drew reaches into the box and
pulls out his FANTASY FOOTBALL TROPHY.

DREW (CONT'D)
But we’re in this together now. And
a lot of innocent people are gonna
die if we don’t bring this where it
needs to go. So listen. We’re gonna
leave this apartment, we’re gonna
fly to Vienna, and give this to
someone named Verne at the Hotel
Sacher Cafe at 6pm tomorrow...

AUDREY
Why are you telling me this if
we're going together?
20.

DREW
In case I don’t make it out of here
alive. Verne. 6pm. Hotel Sacher
Cafe. Then you'll be safe. And so
will everyone else. Got it?

AUDREY
Drew, you’re not gonna die --

DREW
Listen. Don’t trust anybody.

The bathroom door opens and VIKTOR appears in the doorway.
TOTALLY NAKED. CLOSE ON: HIS WEIRD UNCIRCUMCISED DICK.

AUDREY /DREW
Eughhhhhh!

Viktor pulls out a GUN, SHOOTS Drew in the HEART point blank.
Audrey’s next...

THEN. Morgan RUNS out of her room like a banshee. PLOWS into
Viktor full force, shoving him into --

THE KITCHEN

Before he can catch his balance, she pushes Viktor out the
open window. He SCREAMS as he FALLS to his death.

Audrey and Morgan are in total shock. Drew is dead! The
shooting’s stopped -- But only because they now hear a
BATTALION OF FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.

AUDREY
We have to get the fuck out of here!

MORGAN
Oh my God, Drew!

AUDREY
We have to go. Now!

As they BOLT for the FIRE ESCAPE, Audrey yanks the FOOTBALL
TROPHY out of Drew’s dead hands. She spots a wad of FOREIGN
BILLS in his jacket. Stuffs them in her pockets.

Overwhelmed, Audrey gives Drew one last look. Is there
something she could have done? But it’s too late now.

ANGLE on the DOOR as a SWARM of SPECIAL FORCES PERSONNEL
burst in, led by SEBASTIAN and PATEL.

But the girls are gone.
21.

I/E. AUDREY’S HONDA CIVIC - DAY

Audrey, shaking, fighting tears, drives as fast as she can --
not terribly fast. A conservative driver. Morgan’s shotgun.

MORGAN
Where are we going?!

AUDREY
I don’t know. Give me a minute.
Okay. Where would we be safe?

MORGAN
Pull into this parking lot. There’s
a bathroom in Pilates Plus.

AUDREY
We’re not hiding in fucking Pilates
Plus! Where’s the police station? I
think I voted there...

MORGAN
We can’t go to the police. I just
killed someone. And I have a ton of
unpaid speeding tickets. And...
Black Lives Matter.

AUDREY
You killed someone in self-defense.
That doesn’t count.

MORGAN
Just call those CIA agents.

AUDREY
Drew said we can’t trust anyone.
And he’s right. He’s dead. Probably
because I talked to them.

MORGAN
Or because I brought an assassin
into our apartment.

AUDREY
Okay so it’s both our faults.

Audrey slows as she approaches a STOP SIGN.
MORGAN
Go! Why are you stopping at stop
signs? People are after us.
Audrey nervously SPEEDS through the stop sign.

Then her PHONE RINGS on the BLUETOOTH. BLOCKED NUMBER. She
inhales, picks it up. It plays through the CAR SPEAKERS.
22.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Audrey? It’s Sebastian.

AUDREY
You killed Drew. I told you where
he was gonna be and you killed him.

MORGAN
Who is this asshole?

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Are you in the car?
(no response)
What did Drew say to you?

AUDREY
Why would I tell you anything after
everything you’ve done?

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Audrey. Where are you taking it?

Audrey eyes the TROPHY, on the car’s console.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Give us the package. Trust me.

AUDREY
I don’t trust anyone anymore.

Audrey HANGS UP. A moment.

MORGAN
You trust me though, right?

AUDREY
Of course. Not counting you.

MORGAN
Good. Cause this isn’t like, a fake
spy friendship that the Russians
put together.

AUDREY
Dude, shut up. I know.
(grabbing the trophy)
Drew said a lot of people are gonna
die if we don’t deliver this.

MORGAN
What people?

AUDREY
He didn’t get that far. But he was
like, lying on the floor about to
die when he said it. I know he lied
about a lot of shit, but like...
(MORE )
23.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
if I don’t do what he said and a
bunch of people die, in a terrorist
attack or whatever, I will always
wonder if I could have stopped it.

Morgan thinks about this.

MORGAN
That would fucking suck.
(beat)
What did he say we have to do?

 

AUDREY
Bring this to some cafe in Vienna.

MORGAN
Vienna? As in, Austria, Vienna?

AUDREY
That’s what he said.

MORGAN
Then... why don’t we do that?

AUDREY
Why don’t we go to Europe when
people are trying to kill us?

MORGAN
They’re trying to kill us here too.

AUDREY
But we’re just like, regular
people. Yes, we happen to be in
this extreme situation right now
but we are not qualified to like...
do some international spy mission.

MORGAN

It doesn’t sound like a whole
“mission.” It’s just doing this one
thing. Versus staying here and
getting killed. Plus, you’ve never
been to Europe. Do you really want
to die never having gone to Europe?
Or do you want to go to Europe and
die, having been to Europe?

AUDREY
Why are those my only two options?

MORGAN
I don’t know, cause you dated a spy?

AUDREY
You fucked an assassin.
24.

MORGAN
That I did.

Morgan opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, pulls out PASSPORTS.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
I’m just saying. Our passports are
still in here from our road trip to
Mexico. And I have my dad’s credit
card for emergencies...

AUDREY
(beat)
Are we going to Austria?

MORGAN
I think we’re going to Austria.

Audrey sharp-turns on to the FREEWAY ON-RAMP.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
But we should ditch our phones. Bad
guys can track us with our phones.
Even if the phone is off.

AUDREY
How do you know that?

MORGAN
I went to summer camp with Edward
Snowden.
(proudly)
First hand job. Oh my God that guy
was obsessed with me.

She grabs Audrey’s phone and fishes hers from her bag.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
And he was really into ska.

AUDREY
Weird.

MORGAN
Right? When that whole thing was
going down, I was like - hello, why
is no one talking about how Edward
Snowden is really into ska?

Morgan THROWS THEIR PHONES OUT THE WINDOW into the opposite
lane. Watches in the rearview as CARS CRUSH THEM.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Do you think my Candy Crush
progress will be saved?
25.

AUDREY
Yeah, in the cloud. You linked your
account with Facebook, right?

MORGAN
No. I don’t like getting all those
notifications.
(mournful )

Fuck.
I/E. 405 FREEWAY/AUDREY’S HONDA CIVIC - DAY

Audrey starts to pull off at an EXIT.

MORGAN

Why are you getting off here?
AUDREY

To park.
MORGAN

Dude, people are trying to kill us.
We are not fucking parking in Lot C.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Mid-flight. Audrey and Morgan sit next to each other, eyeing
all fellow passengers suspiciously. Wondering who might be a
threat. A WELL-DRESSED BUSINESSMAN. A PROFESSORIAL TYPE in a
bow-tie. Everyone in between. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT passes.

MORGAN
Could I get a Pinot Grigio please?

The Flight Attendant nods and leaves.

AUDREY
You can’t drink right now!

MORGAN
I have to. This is so fucking
stressful. Like, any of these
people could be trying to kill us.

She makes eye contact with a LITTLE GIRL across the aisle.
The little girl stares back stoically. Morgan’s freaked out.

AUDREY
Morgan. We need all our faculties.

MORGAN
(re: her screen)
That guy just drank like three
martinis.

Reveal she’s watching a BOND MOVIE. Audrey’s watching BOURNE.
26.

AUDREY
He’s been doing this a really long
time. This is our first time.

MORGAN
Do you think Drew was a James Bond
kind of spy?

AUDREY
I don’t know. I don’t think James
Bond would like, need to try every
breakfast burrito in Los Angeles.

MORGAN
Yeah. Seems more like a Bourne thing.

AUDREY
Are your parents gonna be pissed
that we used their credit card?

MORGAN
Not if I tell them why. That’s our
family policy. As long as I tell
the truth, they can’t get mad.

AUDREY
Morgan. You can’t tell them the
truth about this.

MORGAN
(deeply conflicted)
What if I tell them we went to
Europe to go to museums?

AUDREY
You just said you weren’t supposed
to lie!

MORGAN
It won't be a lie if we go toa
museum.

(off Audrey’s look)
As long as we're there! We drop off
the trophy at this cafe, that’s like
an hour, tops. And then one museum.

AUDREY
We'll play it by ear.

The wine arrives. Morgan gulps it down. Audrey shakes her
head and puts on her headphones, focusing on her movie.

ANGLE ON: BOURNE in a kickass action sequence... and we...
INT. BARCADE - AUDREY AND DREW - FLASHBACK

Audrey and Drew stand close at the jukebox, scrolling.
27.

DREW
Oh God. That Sarah McLachlan song.
This is the one in the commercial
where the dogs are sad, right?

AUDREY
I think the sad dogs redeem the
song. Ugh, what about Mambo No. 5?

DREW
Please. That’s nothing compared to
Mambos one through four.

Audrey laughs. They’re enjoying each other.

AUDREY
Oh. Oh my God I have it. Close your
eyes. Don’t look.

Drew closes his eyes. Audrey gleefully puts the quarter in.

THE CRASH TEST DUMMIES “MMM MMM MMM MMM” plays. Drew opens
his eyes. Without missing a beat, starts singing along in the
lead singer’s super-deep bass.

DREW
“Oooooonce there was this kiitid
who / got into an accident and
couldn’t come to school / But
wheeen he finally caaaame back... ”

Audrey laughs, totally smitten.
I/E. CAB - DAY

The gorgeous sights of Vienna flash by as the girls sit ina
CAB heading across town. The driver is a middle-aged elegant
AUSTRIAN WOMAN. Morgan and Audrey whisper.

VIENNA, AUSTRIA

MORGAN
She hasn’t smiled once. Do you
think she’s an assassin?

AUDREY
No. We just randomly picked this
cab. And she’s like, delicate.

MORGAN
Dude. Sexist! Women of all shapes
and sizes can be anything they want
to be. They can be assassins...
(points to themselves)
They can be operatives.
28.

AUDREY
I wouldn’t say we’re “operatives.”
This is just one operation.

MORGAN
Yeah. But you and me? We’re always
operating.

Morgan notices something out the window. She GASPS in shock.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Oh my GOD.

AUDREY
(scared)
What? What?!?!

MORGAN
That building is fucking beautiful.

INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE - DAY
An ornate European restaurant packed with high-end tourists

and locals. Audrey and Morgan sit tensely in a corner table,
subtly checking everyone out as they eat SACHERTORTES.

AUDREY
Okay. Who do we think Verne is?
MORGAN
I don’t know. It’s kind of a frumpy
name.
AUDREY

You think? We might just be
pronouncing it frumpy. Like, Jules
Verne wasn’t frumpy.

MORGAN
I beg to differ. And wait, won't
this guy be looking for Drew?

AUDREY
Yes. Shit. He will.

A beat as they scan... then Morgan suddenly TENSES UP.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
What? What do you see?

MORGAN
Nothing...
(sighs)
Okay, I know being here right now
is really important but this cake
is a lot of flour and dairy for me
and... I need to go have diarrhea.
(MORE )
29.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
It’s just a biological fact. No
matter who you are, no matter how
high the stakes in a given moment,
sometimes you have to-

AUDREY
Oh my God just go.

MORGAN
Thank you. I'll be right back.

Morgan rushes toward the bathroom. We stay with Audrey as a
BUTCH WAITRESS approaches.

WAITRESS
Anything else?

SEBASTIAN (0.S.)
Zwei Kaffee, bitte.

Before Audrey knows what’s happening, SEBASTIAN emerges from
behind her, takes Morgan’s seat. Audrey’s about to SCREAM --

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
Don’t scream. I’m the person you’re
here to see.

AUDREY
(confused)
You're Verne?

SEBASTIAN
It’s an alias.
(then)
Hand it over.

Audrey hedges.
AUDREY
If Drew wanted me to give this to
you, why wouldn’t he have done it
himself?

SEBASTIAN
It’s a long story.

AUDREY
I’m not in a rush.

Then something touches her leg under the table. A GUN.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Oh my God!
SEBASTIAN
Don’t make any noise. Just hand it
over. I’m not gonna hurt you. I’m
trying to protect you.

AUDREY
Like you protected Drew?

SEBASTIAN
That wasn’t us. We didn’t do that.

AUDREY
If you were really protecting me,
you wouldn't be pointing a gun at
me. I may not be in the fucking CIA
but I know that.

SEBASTIAN
I’m MI-6, actually.

AUDREY
Whatever.

INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE, BATHROOM - DAY

Morgan washes her hands next to their WAITRESS. She smiles

politely. Then Morgan double-takes.
The waitress’s NAME TAG -- VERNE.

MORGAN
You're Verne?

VERNE
Guttentag!

Morgan rushes out of the bathroom, back to --

INT. HOTEL SACHER CAFE - MOMENTS LATER

Morgan FREEZES, seeing Sebastian at the table with Audrey.

She waves -- tries to get Audrey’s attention. Audrey sees her
but doesn’t react. The gun’s still trained on her.
AT THEIR TABLE -- Sebastian continues to explain.

SEBASTIAN

I’m only pointing this at you so
you sit still and listen. Ina
minute, everyone in this cafe is
going to start shooting. If you
run, you'll be killed. And even if
you manage to get out alive, you
won’t be able to go anywhere.
(MORE )
31.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
If you scan your passport at a
border, there’1l be men with guns a
lot bigger than this one who won’t
say a word before they shoot you in
the face. So hand me what I want
and no one gets hurt.

AUDREY
Except for Drew.

SEBASTIAN
Okay, it’s not productive to keep
bringing that up.

Audrey has no choice. She reaches into her POCKET and grabs
the TROPHY. She starts to hand it over, when --

Morgan -- seeing this -- SCREAMS.

MORGAN
THAT’S. NOT. VERNE!

CHAOS ERUPTS! Almost everyone in the cafe has a gun, and most
of them start SHOOTING. Sebastian whips around, SHOOTS BACK.

A DEAD ASSASSIN plummets into an elaborate ROAST CHICKEN.

A DEAD VERNE FALLS ON TOP OF AUDREY, GUN in her dead hand.
Morgan drops to the ground, hides under a TABLE... thinking
fast, Audrey GRABS Verne’s GUN. Crouching, scans for Morgan --
just as -- an ARYAN-LOOKING MAN with a RIFLE stalks Morgan,
prepares to end her short, wonderful life...

Audrey acts on instinct, aims with precision -- just like
Duck Hunt -- and BLOWS THE GUY’S BRAINS OUT. Saving her.

Morgan looks up, shocked, grateful. AUDREY’s surprised too.
She stares at the gun in her hands -- SHE’S GOOD AT THIS.

Then a GUTTURAL SCREAM from behind them-- Sebastian throws
SCALDING HOT COFFEE on an attacker, stabs a FORK in his neck.
While he’s distracted, Audrey and Morgan fucking run for it.
EXT. VIENNA STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Audrey and Morgan sprint down the alley, panicking...
AUDREY
I just killed someone... oh my god
Morgan, I just killed someone...

MORGAN
Don’t think about it! Keep running!

AUDREY
I_killed someone!
32.

MORGAN
Stop yelling that!

Up ahead, an OLDER RICH COUPLE -- dressed for a night at the
OPERA -- are climbing into their VINTAGE M.G. when --

AUDREY and MORGAN run up behind them like crazy people.
Audrey SNATCHES THE MAN’S KEYS right out of his hand.

MAN
Was machst Du da fiir ScheiBe!

Audrey pushes into the car. Morgan gets in the passenger side.
INT. STOLEN M.G. - SAME

They lock the doors. Audrey hastily turns the car on. The Man
and Woman scream -- YELL for POLICE -- banging on the
windows. Audrey looks down -- A GEAR SHIFT.

AUDREY
Shit. Can you drive a stick?

MORGAN
No! What?! Do I look like a fifty-
five year old man?
EXT. VIENNA ALLEY - SAME

The M.G. rolls VERY SLOWLY down the street in NEUTRAL. The
OLDER COUPLE easily keeps up on foot, banging on the windows.

The car SLOWLY rolls into a NEWSSTAND, barely nudging it...
But PAPERS fall, on to the windshield. Blocking their view.

MORGAN AUDREY
Fuck. Come on.

The girls jump out, apologizing profusely as they run.

AUDREY /MORGAN
Sorry/ so sorry!

EXT. ANOTHER VIENNA STREET - MOMENTS LATER
The girls dash around a corner --

AUDREY
Get in there!

She gestures to an UBER decal on a WAITING CAR. They jump in.

I/E. UBER - DAY

Driving. LUKAS, pierced and bohemian, at the wheel.
33.

AUDREY
Go go go go go! Go! Go!

Lukas stares at HIS PHONE: A picture of an ASIAN MAN.

LUKAS
Mr. Nguyen?

AUDREY
Yes. Mr. Nguyen. Just go!

Audrey throws a bunch of BILLS at him. Lukas shrugs and
drives. Typical Uber chatter ensues.

LUKAS
So you guys visiting?

The girls’ eyes dart everywhere -- frantic -- not listening --

MORGAN
(panicking)
Can we go another way? There’s a
lot of traffic here --

LUKAS
Bottled water? Still? Sparkling?

AUDREY
No! Just drive --

LUKAS
You have enough air back there?

A GUY ON A MOTORCYCLE PULLS ALONGSIDE THEM -- full-head helmet
obscuring his face. He LIFTS a MACHINE GUN. Ready to fire...
Audrey and Morgan SCREAM. Audrey reaches over and kicks her
own LEG down on top of Lukas’s -- SPEEDING THE CAR UP.

AUDREY
Here’s the deal, okay? Some guys
with guns are trying to kill us
right now. Can you just, lose them?

LUKAS
(lighting up)
Fuck yeah!

Lukas starts driving like a MANIAC. EFFECTIVELY. He makes a
SHARP TURN, losing the assassin. The girls exhale. Until:

LUKAS (CONT'D)
Good thing I smoked a little meth
before. Fear is an illusion!

He turns down a ONE-WAY STREET. The wrong way. CARS HONK,
pull to the side. Lukas swerves in and out... on to nearby
TRAIN TRACKS. He drives down the tracks at top speed...
34.
bumping wildly... heads into a NARROW TUNNEL. In the dark,
the lights of an ONCOMING TRAIN appear...

AUDREY
Lukas!

LUKAS
I see it. No problem.

Lukas SPEEDS UP. The girls SCREAM at the top of their
lungs... The Uber pulls out of the tunnel and off to the side
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME -- The TRAIN rushes by.

LUKAS (CONT'D)
Up here!

Lukas lifts a hand to HIGH-FIVE. Before they can return it--

BLAM! -- BLAM!! THE BACK WINDOW shatters! THE GIRLS -- duck!
LUKAS -- is sprayed with bullets. He DIES TEN TIMES OVER.
MORGAN lifts her head cautiously over the back seat... FIVE

MORE MOTORCYCLE GUYS are racing through the tunnel, armed --

MORGAN
Audrey, get on top of him!

Audrey jumps on the LAP of Lukas’s DECIMATED CORPSE. She

DRIVES, cautious at first... then gets an ADRENALINE RUSH.
Drives FASTER AND FASTER. When she gets to a CROSSING, she
TURNS off the tracks, into TRAFFIC -- Weaving between cars.

Audrey is a quick fucking study. She makes a SHARP TURN.
Loses her pursuers. For now.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Hey! Pull over! Stop the car!

A BAROQUE SIGN AHEAD -- STEPHANSPLATZ. METRO STATION. Audrey

pulls up to the curb. Morgan jumps out. Audrey climbs off

Lukas’ dead body. Glances back at him one more time...
AUDREY MORGAN (CONT'D)

(ruefully) Five stars.

Five stars, Lukas.

They sprint toward the Metro. SIRENS in the distance.

INT. VIENNA SUBWAY STATION - DAY

AUDREY and MORGAN run down the ESCALATOR, to the TURNSTILES.

MORGAN
Jump the turnstile!

Audrey stops. There’s a COP patrolling nearby.
35.

INT. VIENNA METRO STATION - MOMENTS LATER

POUNDING MUSIC FROM THEIR CHASE continues as the girls try to
work the confusing METRO PASS DISPENSER.

MORGAN AUDREY
Gah! Fucking take my Euro!

INT. VIENNA METRO STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Music continues as they keep swiping their cards to no
avail... they keep getting an ERROR MESSAGE: FEHLER! FEHLER!

Finally, they get through. Slip into a METRO CAR.
INT. VIENNA METRO - SAME
Audrey and Morgan collapse on to seats, breathless. Finally.

The train moves. They look up -- A VERY PREGNANT WOMAN and an
ELDERLY MAN. Audrey and Morgan exchange a look and give up
their seats. Hold the bars as they continue panting.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION - NIGHT
An industrial underground complex with SCREENS everywhere.
CIA STATION -- PARIS, FRANCE

SEBASTIAN -- still in his bloody shirt -- enters the
SITUATION ROOM. Patel sees him, breaks from a conversation
with WENDY (50s), their permanently-disgruntled BOSS.

PATEL
Great job, Henshaw!
(deadpan)
Your mission was to have everyone
in that cafe die and the girls get
away, right?

Sebastian ignores PATEL, turns to Wendy.

SEBASTIAN
Extenuating circumstances.

WENDY
They had the package and you didn’t
get it. Explain that circumstance.

SEBASTIAN
I was trying to protect them.

PATEL
Why? Let them die. They’re idiots.
I know an idiot when I see one.
36.

SEBASTIAN
(sotto)
In the mirror.
PATEL
I’m not an idiot, Sebastian. I was--
SEBASTIAN
Harvard. Yes. We know.
WENDY
(stern)

Boys. If I wanted to sit here with
two children, I'd spend time with my
own children. And I don’t want to
spend time with my own children. Now
what do we know about these idiots?

PATEL leans over and types a few keys. ON THE SCREENS -- DMV
PHOTOS of AUDREY and MORGAN.

PATEL

Audrey Stockman. 27. Works at
Trader Joe's.

(to Sebastian)
You're right. Can’t let anything
happen to her. Who else would serve
the samples of Vegan Gyoza?

(to Wendy)
She’s worked there since she
graduated from Oberlin with a B
minus average. Which is where she
met this genius...

MORGAN’s PICTURE.

PATEL (CONT'D)
Or shall I say “This Musical
Theater major who designed her own
minor.”

WENDY
In what?

PATEL
She literally minored in
“Personality.”

SEBASTIAN
What’s your point, Patel? You’re
okay letting two innocent women die?

PATEL
I think society is okay letting
these two die. They’re losers. And
we'll catch them the minute they
try to cross the border.

(MORE )
37.

PATEL (CONT'D)
These girls are the stupidest
people America hasn’t managed to
kill yet.

INT. WIEN HAUPTBAHNHOF TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
An uber-modern mall-like International hub.
INT. THE TICKET WINDOW

AUDREY grabs two tickets and hurries through the CROWD,
keeping her head down, lying low... she arrives

INT. OUTSIDE THE GIFT SHOP
Just as MORGAN emerges with a BAG. The girls walk quickly.

AUDREY
Keep moving. There are cameras
everywhere.

MORGAN
I got us changes of clothes.

Morgan pulls out two BASEBALL HATS with MOZART’S FACE.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
They really play up that Mozart’s
from here. Really downplay that
Hitler’s from here.

The girls put on the hats and head for the tracks.

AUDREY
What else did you get?

MORGAN
Everything that said Wiener on it.

She shows Audrey a jar of VIENNA SAUSAGES and a cake labeled
TORTE WIENER ART. Then Audrey suddenly STOPS.

AUDREY
Wait. Fuck. Our passports.
Sebastian said we'll get stopped if
we try to use them.

MORGAN
Okay. So we just have to get new
ones. Let’s find a couple of girls
who look like us, tell them what
happened and convince them to give
us theirs. They can just go to the
embassy and say theirs were stolen.

AUDREY
Who would do that for us?
38.

MORGAN
Any girls! It’s girl code. Eat Pray
Love.

AUDREY

They look kinda like us.
She points to two KIND OF NERDY GIRLS who look like them.

MORGAN
Babe, what are you talking about?
Those girls look nothing like us.
Those girls look like us.

Morgan points to two TALL BACKPACKERS WHO LOOK LIKE MODELS.
INT. TRAIN STATION BENCH - MOMENTS LATER

By the TRACKS -- Audrey and Morgan are nearly in TEARS as
they explain their predicament to the AUSTRALIAN BACKPACKERS.

AUDREY
... Just think about the only guy
you've ever really loved dying in
front of you. And asking you to do
this one thing for him. Wouldn’t
you sacrifice anything?

MORGAN
Yeah, I mean this was my favorite
shirt. It’s H&M but now it’s also
B&B. Blood and Brains.

AUSSIE TOURIST 1
You guys are weird.

MORGAN
We're not...

(mocking Australian accent)
weeeeeid. We're serious. You’d be
saving our lives. And a lot of
other innocent people. You don’t
want those people to die, right?

AUDREY
Please guys. Just go to the embassy
and get new passports. We’ll give
you some money for your time --

AUSSIE TOURIST 2
Sorry. We’d love to help you out,
mate, but we don’t know you and...

MORGAN
No, I get it. I get it.
39.

The TRAIN pulls in behind them. Morgan and Audrey exchange a
look. They both know what they have to do.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Thanks anyway. It was beautiful
meeting you two.

AUDREY
Have a great time in Poland.

They pull the two Backpackers in for a HUG...

MORGAN
(yelling)
Now!

AUDREY and MORGAN GRAB the girls’ FANNY PACKS and dash for
the WAITING TRAIN. Before the Aussies know what’s happening,
the train has left the station. Along with their passports.

PRE-LAP thumping ETHEREAL HOUSE MUSIC...

INT. MILAN PALAZZO - NIGHT

Dizzying strobe lights -- thumping bass -- an AVANT GARDE

runway show in a drafty PALACE BALLROOM. Androgynous men and

women move stiffly down the catwalk in clothes that look like

armor. Vacant faces STREAKED with black and metallic paint.
MILAN, ITALY

We track one MODEL -- 6’3, deathly pale, beauty that only

exists in unpronounceable countries. NADEJDA (pronounced

“Nadia” but everything, including spelling, is harder where

she’s from.) She completes her walk and heads back to --

INT. MILAN PALAZZO BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

 

The bullpen. Nadedja ignores the chatter of models and
interns as she goes to a CUBBY, removes an expensive leather
bag. Pulls out her BUZZING PHONE. In a heavy SLAVIC accent:

NADEDJA
Hello... Yes... I understand.

She crosses behind a CURTAIN, pulls it shut.
INT. DRESSING AREA - CONTINUOUS

Nadedja strips NAKED, revealing a bony, hairless body. She
pulls out the components of --

A GUN. Assembles it expertly. From outside the curtains --
40.

MALE INTERN (0.S.)
Nadedja? You’re not changing, are
you? Carlo wants everyone out
there.

Nadedja continues, unperturbed by the request. Moves on to a
HANDGUN -- screws in a SILENCER.

The curtain is YANKED OPEN, revealing the CHUBBY MALE INTERN.

MALE INTERN (CONT’D)
Carlos said now -- HOLY SHIT.

His eyes widen, taking in the nudity -- luckier than he’s
ever been in his life. And ever will be. Because he’s about
to die. He should not have seen those guns.

Nadedja moves like lightning -- AIMS, FIRES. Intern FALLS.

She pulls a shapeless FROCK from a nearby rack, checks her
reflection in a mirror. Uses a MAKEUP SPONGE to wipe the
Intern’s blood off her face, steps over him in her stilettos.

EXT. STREETS OF MILAN - DAY

Nadedja climbs into a MERCEDES SLR MACLAREN -- mirrored
exterior, as otherworldly as she is. This is like, a 650K€
car (given the current European economy, you could negotiate
down to six, but Nadedja doesn’t negotiate.) She speeds away.

I/E. TRAIN - DAY

Gorgeous countryside. Audrey and Morgan -- now in different
clothes -- sit in a TRAIN COMPARTMENT. Morgan holds the
TROPHY, Audrey removes a PHONE from one of the FANNY PACKS.

MORGAN
We should get you a gun. Cause
dude. Back there? In that cafe?
You're like, deadly.

AUDREY
I play a lot of Duck Hunt.

MORGAN
(re: trophy)
God, what is the fucking deal with
this thing?

AUDREY
I don’t know. That’s what we have
to figure out.

MORGAN
Or maybe... we don’t. I mean, Drew
asked you to hand it to this one
person. We tried.

(MORE )
41.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
People shot at us. And each other.
Clearly this isn’t as easy as we
thought. Maybe we should just
like... throw it out the window.
Then it’s just... not on us.

Audrey thinks about it. Tempting, but she just can’t.

AUDREY
No. If it’s really that important
and we just ditch it and something
really bad happens... I don’t want
that blood on my hands. In addition
to the literal blood that’s already
all over my hands.

MORGAN
That train station hand soap is for
shit.

AUDREY

We just have to get out of this
country of murderers. We'll be in
Prague in a few hours.

MORGAN
Prague does not sound free of
murderers.

But Audrey's distracted, clicking around on one of the
Aussie’s CELL PHONES with a bejeweled pot leaf case.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
What are you looking at?

AUDREY
Facebook. Photos of me and Drew.
He’s looking away in every picture.
How did I never notice that before?

MORGAN
When you’re in love you don’t see
shit you don’t want to see. Are
those his parents?

ANGLE on a photo of Audrey and Drew -- head turned -- with a
MIDDLE AGED MIDWESTERN-LOOKING couple. TOM and MARSHA.

AUDREY
Yeah. I met them the night before
he disappeared. We all went to the
Cheesecake Factory.

MORGAN
God, that menu. Too many options.
42.

AUDREY
I know. We ended up splitting a lot
of things.

MORGAN

Do you think they knew?

AUDREY
I don’t know who knows anything
anymore. All I know is I really
fucking liked that guy...

INT. BARCADE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The CRASH TEST DUMMIES song is still playing. Audrey and Drew
SLOW-DANCE in the bar, half-ironic, Junior High-style.

AUDREY
I don’t know. Like my best friend
always knew she wanted to be an
actress. And she’s just... a natural
at it. I’ve never had anything like
that. I’ve never had a thing where
people are like, “Audrey, this is
what you were born to do.”

DREW
You will.

AUDREY
How do you know? You just met me.

DREW
I’m a good judge of character.

Audrey smiles. A moment. Are they going to kiss? Then the
song FADES OUT, breaking the moment.

AUDREY
Anyway, thanks for the dance.

DREW
You too.

Audrey heads back to MORGAN, drinking at the bar...
DREW (CONT’D)
Actually, wait.
(she turns around)
Let’s play it again.
Drew pulls a TWENTY out of his wallet.

DREW (CONT’D)
Like, a lot of times.

Audrey laughs, delighted.
43.

CZECH BORDER GUARD (PRE-LAP)
Passports?

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

CLOSE on two stern-looking CZECH SOLDIERS studying the
AUSTRALIAN GIRLS’ PASSPORTS. They look up and we --

RACK FOCUS to AUDREY and MORGAN, smiling innocently from
their seats. Morgan speaks in a HEAVY AUSTRALIAN ACCENT.

MORGAN
Hi! Name’s Briony! As you can tell
by my accent, I grew up in Perth.
Though I live in Sydney now.

Audrey chimes in awkwardly... in a TEXAS DRAWL.

AUDREY
Great uniforms! Thanks y’all!

The guards stamp their passports and hand them back. Move on.
Audrey and Morgan slide the door shut and exhale.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
I can’t believe that worked.

MORGAN
Me neither. You sounded like if
Matthew McConaughey had a stroke.

AUDREY
Wait. I just thought of something.

MORGAN
What?

Audrey picks up the TROPHY. BASHES IT against the armrest.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
What are you doing?! What if that’s
like, a bomb?

AUDREY
No way. We went through airport
security. Twice.

Sure enough, the trophy CRACKS. There’s a FLASH DRIVE inside.

MORGAN
Oh my God, dude. Audrey! You are
such an operative right now.

AUDREY
I bet we’ll know what to do and
where to go if we can just figure
out what’s on this thing.
44,

She pulls out the drive, discards the trophy.

MORGAN
But we don’t have our laptops. And
even if we did, I’m sure it’s like,
top secret stuff in code or
whatever. We’d need some computer
genius to figure it out for us...

SMASH TO:
INT. PRAGUE APPLE STORE - DAY
The iconic APPLE image above the GENIUS BAR.
PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC

A CZECH VERSION of an AMERICAN COMPUTER GEEK -- GAUGED ears,
kinda cool, kinda not. NEON GREEN tee. He holds the drive.

CZECH GENIUS
It’s not something we sell. But
let's take a look!

He opens the nearest LAPTOP and plugs the drive into the USB
port. A STREAM OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS APPEAR.

CZECH GENIUS (CONT’D)
Wow. This is something I have not
seen before. Let me ask Lubos...

INT. PRAGUE APPLE STORE - DAY

NINE GENIUSES huddle over the laptop. No other customers are
being helped. The STORE MANAGER shakes his head.

STORE MANAGER
I’ve never seen anything like this.
This is some serious government Mr.
Robot shit. Where did you get this?

AUDREY MORGAN
Uh, Best Buy? My Grandma Rose... who works
at Best Buy.
LUBOS -- ENORMOUS, BEARDED -- pipes up.
LUBOS

Wait. Here’s something...
(he clicks)
What if we open up this guy...
The Geniuses nod, mutter their agreement.

ALL POWER IN THE APPLE STORE goes OUT. THE COMPUTERS SMOKE!
45.

CZECH GENIUS
What the fuck... ?

AUDREY
(to Morgan)
Fuck. Get the drive! Get it out!

In the darkness, Morgan GRABS THE FLASH DRIVE. They RUN.
INT. CIA PARIS STATION - DAY

In the bullpen, on a COMPUTER SCREEN, a NOTIFICATION FLASHES
on a DIGITAL MAP. A TECH shouts to the room:

TECH
Prague! They’re in Prague.

I/E. MERCEDES MACLAREN - DAY
Nadedja -- intense EDM blasting -- SPEEDS down a highway.
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY

The iconic bridge. Packed with tourists, vendors, caricature
artists. Morgan and Audrey move through the crowd. Morgan
holds the Aussie’s POT LEAF PHONE.

MORGAN
I just want to tell them I’m safe! I
haven’t gone a day without talking
to my parents, like, ever.

AUDREY
Fine. But you cannot tell them
what’s going on.

MORGAN
I can’t lie. That’s our deal. If I
tell the truth, they can’t get mad.

AUDREY
They might get mad this time.

MORGAN
They didn’t get mad when I tried
cocaine with our rabbi. They didn’t
get mad when I blew the homeless guy.

AUDREY
You didn’t know he was homeless
though.

MORGAN

That’s what they said! Trust me.
It’s better to have someone know
where we are right now.
46.

Audrey sighs but doesn’t argue as Morgan steps aside, dials.
The phone rings. Morgan’s mom CAROL answers.

CAROL (V.O.)
Hello?

MORGAN
Mom! It’s me.

INT. CAROL AND ARNIE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY- INTERCUT

CAROL (50s) sits at the kitchen table in their suburban home,
cutting an ARTICLE out of the Asbury Park Press.

CAROL
Oh thank God. Arnie, she’s okay!
Honey you’re all over the news.

REVEAL the article is about AUDREY and MORGAN. “FREEHOLD
NATIVE AND FRIEND SOUGHT IN INT’L MURDER CONSPIRACY”.

CAROL (CONT'D)
I’m conferencing your father in.

INT. CAROL AND ARNIE’S BATHROOM - SAME- INTERCUT
ARNIE (50s) is on the toilet, on his cell.

ARNIE
Honey? This is Dad. Where are you?
Did you and Audrey murder two
people? That’s what they said on
Channel Seven.

MORGAN
No! I mean yes I killed someone but
he was an assassin. And then Audrey
killed someone in Austria. But that
was self-defense...

ARNIE
You’re in Austria?!

CAROL
Arnie, get out of the bathroom. I
can hear the echo.
A FLUSH.

CAROL (CONT'D)
Oh God, mute yourself. Your
father’s a pig.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION - DAY

A LISTENING STATION picks up a HIT. A map of NEW JERSEY with
a blinking dot over FREEHOLD. Another TECH traces the call.
47.

TECH 2
Charles Bridge. Prague.

EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY

AUDREY nervously looks around at passersby, suspecting
everyone. Morgan is still absorbed in her PHONE CALL.

INT. CAROL AND ARNIE’S BEDROOM - SAME - INTERCUT
Arnie is now sitting on the bed.

MORGAN
...And we can’t go to the police
because they might be in on this.
That’s what we’re trying to figure
out right now.

ARNIE
Where are you staying tonight?

MORGAN
We hadn’t gotten that far...

ARNIE
Listen. I have a friend. Roger
Bernstein. Ophthalmologist. Met him
doing Doctors Without Borders. He’s
got a big place in Prague. Lotta
money, that guy. Married a Czech
woman. Beautiful girl. Zaftig.

CAROL
Arnie.

ARNIE
She left him but he stayed on. I
think he likes the culture.

CAROL
Sexually adventurous.

ARNIE
He'll behave. I’11 give him a call.

EXT. PRAGUE BUILDING - DAY

NADEDJA stands on top of BUILDING, behind a SNIPER RIFLE. She
looks through her sight at --

THE CHARLES BRIDGE.

Nadedja pauses. Makes a CALL. The voice on the other end
speaks through a VOICE MODULATOR.
48.

NADEDJA
Who am I looking for?

VOICE MODULATOR (V.O.)
I texted pictures. Targets are two
dumb American women.
Nadedja looks on her phone. Pictures of AUDREY and MORGAN.

She looks through her sight again. THROUGH THE CROSSHAIRS: SO
MANY PAIRS OF DUMB AMERICAN WOMEN --

Two SLUTTY GIRLS take duck-face Selfies.

A DRUNK CHICK pukes over the side of the bridge while her
HUNG-OVER FRIEND holds her hair back.

Two girls HUMP a statue of JESUS, cracking each other up.
OFF NADEDJA -- she has no idea who to shoot.
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY
Audrey, sensing DANGER, leans over to Morgan.
MORGAN
(into phone)
Wait, there are Ophthalmologists in

Doctors Without Borders?

AUDREY
We should go.

CAROL
What, you think people in
Afghanistan don’t have astigmatism?
ARNIE
Your judgment is also a border,
young lady.
Audrey GRABS THE PHONE and THROWS IT OFF THE BRIDGE.

AUDREY
We have to fucking go!

EXT. STREETS OF PRAGUE - DAY

The girls race CITY BIKES through Prague, passing Cathedrals,
Museums, etc. Not stopping to see the sights.

I/E ROGER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Audrey and Morgan POUND ON THE ORNATE WOODEN DOOR as they
glance behind them, paranoid. Finally it opens. ROGER (50s) --
cardigan, balding, benign -- appears.
49.

ROGER
Whoa there! One of you must need
the bathroom.

Morgan and Audrey just hurry inside and slam the door.

MORGAN
Yeah. Sorry. Nice to meet you.

ROGER
(to Audrey)
You must be Morgan! You've got your
mother’s face.

MORGAN
Actually... I’m Morgan.

AUDREY
Audrey.

ROGER

Audrey, has anyone ever told you
you've got Morgan’s mother’s face?

The uncle humor relaxes them a bit. Roger leads the way
upstairs - but the girls linger, glancing at the door.

AUDREY
Mind if I lock the door... ?

ROGER
Nervous traveler, eh?
(she nods)
Come on. Let’s go help you relax.
He WINKS as he locks the bolt. The girls cringe a little. Ew.
INT. ROGER’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

At a candlelit table, Audrey and Morgan serve themselves
salad. Roger enters from the kitchen.

ROGER
You girls look like you’d enjoy
some pot...
He pulls a POT ROAST off the counter.

ROGER (CONT'D)
...Roast!

He cracks himself up.
AUDREY

Thank you so much, Roger, I’m
starving.
50.

Audrey serves herself some but Morgan wrinkles her nose.

MORGAN
Oooh. Uh... I’m sort of vegan.

ROGER
Oh. I wish I’d known...

MORGAN
It’s kind of a new thing.

AUDREY
Except when she gets really drunk
and eats bacon-wrapped hot dogs off
this gross cart.

MORGAN
Drunk Morgan doesn’t have the same
ethics as sober Morgan.

AUDREY
Roger, this is delicious. You’re a
great cook.

ROGER
Morgan, I can’t let you eat salad
for dinner. What kind of host would
I be? I’11l just whip something up.

He ducks back into the kitchen. A moment.

MORGAN
Am I crazy or is Roger into me?

AUDREY
Oh God.

Audrey clutches her stomach.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
I think I’m eating too fast. All
this meat is hitting me weird.
MORGAN
That’s your body questioning your
moral decisions.

AUDREY
I’m gonna find the bathroom.

INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Audrey, pale, clutching her stomach, races into the bathroom
and THROWS UP in the toilet.
51.

INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Roger re-emerges with a dish of GRILLED EGGPLANT.

ROGER
Here. Eat.

MORGAN
You know what? I’m good. I’m trying
not to eat when I’m not hungry.

ROGER
What happened to Audrey?

MORGAN
She went to the bathroom. But I
think she’s done.

ROGER

Then let’s retire to the living

room, shall we?
Morgan smiles politely and follows, but she’s skeeved out.
INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Audrey wretches again. IN HER POV... The room is SPINNING.
INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Roger and Morgan stand before an intense EGON SCHIELE NUDE.

ROGER
You like art?

MORGAN
She doesn’t look like she’s
enjoying herself.

ROGER
Sometimes the sweetest pleasure
comes when you’re not enjoying
yourself.

MORGAN
I don’t think I agree with that.

And then Roger PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER. Morgan stiffens.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Uh, hey Roger? You’re so nice and
my dad says great things about you
and everything you did with those
refugees’ eyes... but...

He squeezes Morgan’s shoulder harder.
52.
MORGAN (CONT'D)
Ow. That hurts, actually. Can you --

She realizes Roger’s hands are drifting up to her NECK.
Before Morgan can stop him, he’s SHOVED HER TO THE GROUND.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Aaaaaah! Help!

She kicks Roger in the BALLS.

ROGER MORGAN (CONT'D)
Ow! Fuck! Audrey!

Roger climbs on top of Morgan.
INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM- SAME

Still in Audrey’s POV. Morgan’s yelling is muffled. Audrey
tries to stand -- but loses her balance. She falls into --

THE SHOWER.

THERE’S A DEAD BODY IN THE TUB. A different BALD NERD. THE
REAL ROGER. Audrey flails to get off him. It’s tough. She’s
been drugged. She COLLAPSES to the floor, barely conscious.
INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Roger, on top of a screaming Morgan, yanks up the side of her
shirt and injects her with a TRANQUILIZER.

INT. ROGER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Roger tosses a WOOZY MORGAN into the bathroom with Audrey,
slams the door. The girls are barely lucid.

MORGAN
Audrey... Roger drugged me...

AUDREY
That’s not Roger.

Audrey pulls back the shower curtain, reveals the body.
Morgan gasps. Audrey pulls out the flash drive.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
You have to swallow this.

MORGAN
What?

AUDREY
So they can’t find it. Come on!
Before he comes back!
53.

MORGAN
You swallow it.

AUDREY
I just puked like nine times. I’11
just throw it back up.

MORGAN
I can’t even swallow Advil! I have
to mash it up and put it in

Applesauce... that thing is huge.
AUDREY
Pretend it’s that homeless guy.
MORGAN
(fading)

Dude. I didn’t know...
Audrey musters the strength to lift Morgan’s head to the
sink. She runs the water into Morgan’s mouth, putting the
FLASH DRIVE IN. Morgan tries to swallow... but coughs it up.

AUDREY
Lift your head back. Hold your nose.

Morgan tries holding her nose and dangling the flash drive
into her mouth. It goes in... and Morgan starts CHOKING.
Audrey SLAPS her on the back. The flash drive flies out.
Audrey, passing out, picks up the flash drive, thinking fast--

THE DOOR flies open just AS THE TOILET FLUSHES. “Roger” is
flanked by THREE THUGS. IN THE GIRLS’ POV, we FADE TO BLACK.

INT. ABANDONED LOCKER ROOM - DAY

The girls come to -- finding their hands are CHAINED TO PIPES

above their heads. They’re in an old, rusted out locker room.
MORGAN

Audrey?

They’re not alone. A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE sits by the SHOWERS.

Audrey squints at them -- recognizes them -- gasps!

IT’S DREW'S PARENTS. TOM and MARSHA are typical Midwesterner

parents -- greying, thick, Patagonias. They look exhausted.
AUDREY

Oh my God. Tom! Marsha!

MORGAN
Who?
54.

AUDREY
Drew’s parents.
(to Tom and Marsha)
Oh God. Am I the reason you got
dragged into this? Believe me, I
never meant for of this to happen.
I never meant for Drew to die...

MORGAN
Help us get these off before they
come back and chain you up too...

Marsha nods sweetly, crosses slowly to Audrey and... PUNCHES
HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE.

AUDREY
Ahhhhhh! What the --

Marsha speaks... with a HEAVY RUSSIAN ACCENT.

MARSHA
Shut up, you dumb bitch.

TOM
Where’s the drive?

He has an accent too. He approaches Morgan, pulling a KNIFE.

AUDREY
(realizing)
You guys are in on this too.

TOM
Tell your friend to answer my
fucking question.

AUDREY
Trust me. Your son would have
wanted you to protect us.

MORGAN
Uh, Audrey. I don’t think those are
really Drew’s parents.

AUDREY

Yes they are! Right?

(to Tom and Marsha)
That dinner happened. We split the
chicken lettuce wraps. We talked
about Tom’s colonoscopy. We both
love Scandal, Marsha! I was team
Fitz, you were team Jake! Jake’s
the good guy! Scott Foley!
55.

MARSHA
I can like Scott Foley and be a
Russian operative who is not Drew’s
mother. Drew worked for us.

TOM
Where’s the fucking drive?!

He holds the KNIFE to Audrey’s throat. A long beat.

AUDREY
I... flushed it down the toilet.

Silence. This is a big fucking deal.

TOM
Do you know what you’ve done?

He glares at them. It’s a scary fucking look.

TOM (CONT'D)
Nadedja!

NADEDJA enters, now wearing a FORM-FITTING LEATHER SUIT.

MARSHA
Shoot these cunts in the head.

TOM
Torture them first. Make sure
they’re not lying.

AUDREY
We’re not! We have no reason to
lie! We don’t even know what’s on
that drive! No one ever told us!

They leave the girls with Nadedja. She UNZIPS her CASE --

lays out a bunch of fucked up looking DENTAL EQUIPMENT.

Audrey starts shaking. Morgan nervously starts rambling...
MORGAN

You're really pretty. Like you’re

barely human you’re so pretty --

AUDREY
Morgan, shut up.

MORGAN
No! Everybody likes compliments!

NADEDJA removes a pair of PLIERS. Approaches Morgan.
MORGAN (CONT'D)

Wow! Did you sharpen that yourself?
Do you work with metal often?
56.

Nadia brings the PLIERS closer.

MORGAN (CONT'D) AUDREY
Oh God oh God oh God... Please no, stop!

EXT. BELGIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A fleet of BLACK SUVs races across the bleak countryside.
I/E BLACK SUV - SAME

Patel drives the lead car. Sebastian sits shotgun.

EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA, BELGIUM - DAY

A long-abandoned, run down ICE HOCKEY RINK from the 70s.
That’s where the girls are being held.

On the ROOF -- the parents and some THUGS load gear into a
whirring HELICOPTER. ANGLE ON the DECAL on the chopper --

VOLVO. (Did you know Volvo made choppers? Apparently they do
for assassins posing as Midwestern parents)

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Nadedja nears Audrey’s mouth with the pliers...
NADEDJA
I ask question. If I don’t like
answer, I take tooth. Same as her.
A SOB. We reveal Morgan -- BLOOD is pouring from her mouth.
MORGAN
That was a fucking wisdom tooth! It
was all the way up in there.

NADEDJA
Where is the drive?

AUDREY
I already told them. I flushed it
down the toilet.

NADEDJA
I don’t like answer.

She takes the PLIERS to one of Audrey’s FRONT TEETH.

MORGAN
This is so bad for women!

Nadedja brutally TWISTS AUDREY’S TOOTH. Audrey GASPS in pain.
57.

EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY

THE SUVs pull up just in time to see the CHOPPER LEAVING.
INT. BLACK SUV - DAY- CONTINUOUS

Patel and Sebastian watch as the chopper retreats.

PATEL
Fuck. They got the drive.
(into a handset)
Okay kids. On my order, scuttle the
F-15s. Let’s blow this shithole up.

SEBASTIAN
Wait. The girls could be in there.

PATEL
If they are, they’re either dead or
surrounded by terrorists. Also: I
don’t care.

SEBASTIAN
Just give me five minutes and three
agents. I want to check.

PATEL
So four agents can get killed? I
can’t authorize that. And this is
my operation.

THE RADIO (V.O.)
F-15s are a minute out.

PATEL
Sweet. Let’s crush this mother like
we've crushed Yale in every
football game since 2007.
(beat)
By “we” I mean Harvard.

Sebastian makes a snap decision. He SLAMS PATEL’S HEAD INTO
THE STEERING WHEEL, knocking him out. Sebastian seizes his
RADIO. Does his best Patel impression:

SEBASTIAN
Actually guys, hold up? Abort
mission.

THE RADIO (V.O.)
Roger that.

SEBASTIAN
Go Crimson.

He HANDCUFFS Patel to the steering wheel.
58.

EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - MOMENTS LATER

Sebastian, HANDGUN up, creeps along the side of the building.
INT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - CONTINUOUS

A GUARD on the other side of the door with a RIFLE.

Sebastian leaps out of nowhere -- KICKS HIM IN THE FACE -- we
see his training in action. The Guard’s rifle CLANGS to the
ground. Sebastian STOMPS on his fallen body. He’s out.
THROUGH ANOTHER SET OF DOORS

Sebastian peeks out -- moves quietly -- hiding under a
BLEACHER. Takes in the cavernous HOCKEY RINK.

Rats scuttle across DIRT where the ICE used to be. A MASSIVE
DECREPIT ZAMBONI in the corner. A moldy old HOCKEY GOAL.

In the shadows, creepy THUGS stalk, on patrol.

A muffled SCREAM from across the rink. Sebastian spots the
locker room door on the far side. Knows they’re in there.

FLICK! A RUSSIAN GUARD lights a cigarette inches from
Sebastian -- doesn’t see him. He takes a drag, enjoying it.
He’d better - it’ll be his last ever. He walks a couple
paces, around the ZAMBONI --

Sebastian’s waiting. In one fluid move, he has the guard in a
headlock -- shoves the lit cigarette into his mouth -- holds
it closed as the guard burns from the inside. Then crumples.

Sebastian drops him -- runs swiftly, unseen, under the rink-
side barriers. Stops a few yards from the LOCKER ROOM...

A CARD TABLE stands in the way. NINE BAD FUCKING GUYS around
it. All with guns on them. Eating, drinking, laughing.

Sebastian silently checks his clip. He wouldn’t have enough
bullets for all of them even if every shot was perfect. Fuck.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Blood is now streaming out of both the girls’ mouths.

Nadedja smiles for the first time -- albeit sadistically --
as she pulls out JUMPER CABLES attached to a CAR BATTERY.
AUDREY
I’m telling you we don’t know
anything!
MORGAN

I’ve never kept a secret in my
life! I tell everyone everything!
59.

Nadedja just hits the jumpers together. SPARKS fly.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
I have herpes!

AUDREY
What are you doing?

MORGAN
Proving to her that I’m honest and
have nothing to hide! I stole my
dad's painkillers from his hernia
surgery and sold them at Coachella!

Nadedja approaches Morgan with the jumpers...

MORGAN (CONT'D)
I text while I drive -- drunk --
all the time! I once made out with
this guy who has a hormone disorder
where he looks twelve. He’s
actually forty, but still! It’s
like I hooked up with a child!

AUDREY
Morgan. This is not helping--
MORGAN
Tell her something personal about
you.
AUDREY
No!
MORGAN

Audrey has a recurring sex dream
about Turtle from Entourage!

Nadedja SHOCKS MORGAN. Morgan SCREAMS. Blinding pain.

I/E. BLACK SUV - DAY

Patel stirs awake -- groggily realizes what happened. Then
realizes his hand is CUFFED.

PATEL
You fucking dick, Henshaw.

Fuming, he reaches down with his free arm, manages to grab
the WIRE to his mouthpiece. Talks into it.

PATEL (CONT'D)
Okay! Send the F-15s.

INT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY

SEBASTIAN HEARS THIS...
60.
PATEL (V.O.)
Drop the payload. Now.
SEBASTIAN knows he has to move. Now.
THE ZAMBONI -- MOMENTS LATER
Sebastian sits astride the beast. There’s no way this thing
still works, right? No fucking way. But he has to try. He
turns the IGNITION. It burps awake. Fucking miracle.
AT THE CARD TABLE

The thugs are confused. What the fuck is that? THE ZAMBONI
ROARS AHEAD -- NOW ON TOP OF THEM.

SEBASTIAN drives. One moment the table was full of scary
dudes. Now a THREE TON hunk of metal and giant spinning
blades SHRED the life out of every one of them.

Someone’s SEVERED HAND flies into the HOCKEY GOAL.

Sebastian doesn’t have time to be impressed with himself -- A
GIANT MAN pulls him out of his seat.

No actually, a straight up HULK -- pulls him to the ground.
Stands over him. This guy is the biggest monster Russia has
ever created and he’s about to crush Sebastian.

Sebastian KICKS. Gets him in the shin. This is nothing to
him. Hulk leans down, takes Sebastian’s left arm. SNAPS IT.
Blinding pain. Then Hulk SHOOTS him in the OTHER SHOULDER.

Sebastian writhes in agony as the thug points his gun at
Sebastian’s head. So much for playing hero. He’s gonna die.

One last ditch thought -- Sebastian grabs for his gun. With
two fucked up arms, he can’t AIM so he just SHOOTS WILDLY.
WHEREVER HE CAN. Hulk laughs. Bullets nowhere near him, but --
ONE BULLET ricochets around the rafters, hits a CHAIN. Which
holds -- AN ANCIENT SCOREBOARD. The scoreboard FALLS, right
on the Hulk. CRUSHES his SKULL.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Hearing the LOUD NOISE, Nadedja turns. What was that?

A momentary reprieve for Morgan and Audrey as she grabs two
guns and heads toward the noise...

INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Sebastian crouches under the bleachers as NADEDJA’S HIGH
HEELS pass. Once she’s gone -- he crawls to the locker room.
61.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sebastian enters and GASPS.

Audrey and Morgan look horrible. But they’re alive. Seeing
him, they start collapsing in sobs -- but there’s no time --

SEBASTIAN
We have to move fast.

Sebastian struggles to lift Audrey -- unhooks her from the
pipe she hangs from. Not easy given his own injuries...

Audrey unhooks Morgan. They hurry toward the BACK EXIT--
EXT. ABANDONED ICE HOCKEY ARENA - DAY

A bloody, hobbled Audrey, Morgan and Sebastian hurry out of
the arena into the sunlight. The girls stop.

AUDREY
Where are we -- ?

SEBASTIAN
Keep moving! Go! Go!

The F-15s buzz over the ARENA. DROP THEIR PAYLOAD.

Sebastian pulls them away as fast as he can as the building --
EXPLODES. A fiery boom. Then just a fire.

The old rink is now a HEAP of RUBBLE along with everyone
inside. At least they’re safe. Sebastian crouches over the

girls, shielding them from the debris. As the smoke clears:

AUDREY
Okay. I trust you now.

SEBASTIAN
Jesus, I should hope so.

But when the smoke clears... there are FIFTY SPECIAL FORCES
AGENTS surrounding them. Guns drawn. Oh shit.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION, HOLDING CELL - DAY

Sebastian -- one arm bandaged, one in a SLING -- sits with
the girls in a holding room.

AUDREY
Be honest. Does this look fake?

She smiles. An UNNATURALLY WHITE FAKE TOOTH where hers was.

MORGAN
You know I would never lie to you.
62.

Morgan leaves it at that. Audrey turns to Sebastian.

AUDREY
I should have just given you the
drive in the cafe. Then none of
this would have happened.

SEBASTIAN
I wouldn’t have believed me either.
Drew told you to keep it safe.

MORGAN
Okay. Can you just tell us what is
on that fucking drive?

SEBASTIAN
I actually don’t know. What I know
is it was made by an international
terrorist group called Highland.
Intelligence tells us they’re
planning a series of
assassinations. High profile
people. The plans will be on that
drive. So if we had it, we’d know
how to stop them.

Audrey is about to say something when --

THE DOOR OPENS. WENDY enters with PATEL -- his nose broken
and bandaged.

WENDY
Henshaw? My office. Patel, stay
here.

Sebastian glances back at the girls, then follows Wendy out.
In their wake, PATEL is alone with the girls. Awkwardly:

AUDREY
What happened to your nose?

PATEL
Your new best friend slammed my
head into a steering wheel so he
could put our entire team at risk.
In order to save you.

AUDREY
Oh.

An awkward silence.
MORGAN

So, “Patel.” Do you know a Danny
Patel who went to Wesleyan?
63.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION - WENDY'S OFFICE - DAY
Wendy coldly sits across from Sebastian.

WENDY
Henshaw, you read English at
university. Did you ever learn the
word “hierarchy”?

SEBASTIAN
Wendy, I know I --

WENDY
How about the word “treason”?
That’s a good one. Love when it
comes up in the crossword.

SEBASTIAN
I know I overstepped --

WENDY
Overstepped? Overstepping is
wearing a tank top on Casual
Friday. Overstepping is stealing my
Activia from the office fridge even
though I brought it from home.

SEBASTIAN
I didn’t steal your Activia.

WENDY
Goddammit. We work for an
international intelligence
organization and I can't figure out
who’s been eating my yogurt. My
point is you did a lot more than
overstep. You violated my direct
orders, handcuffed your superior
and went into a building swarming
with terrorists without backup.

SEBASTIAN
I know. I exercised poor judgment --
WENDY
Which one of them is it?
SEBASTIAN
Sorry?
WENDY

The only reason I can fathom why
you'd put the entire mission on the
line to save two girls’ lives is
you're in love with one of them. So
which one is it?

(MORE )
64.

WENDY (CONT'D)
The one with the tooth or the one
who invited me to see her in Pippin
at the Santa Monica Playhouse?

INT. CIA PARIS STATION HOLDING CELL - LATER
PATEL paces the room, enjoying this. The girls are upset.

PATEL
So what was going through your mind
exactly when you flushed it down
the toilet? “This thing is so
important that actual people are
actually dying because of it. So I
know what I’11 do! I’1l treat it
like a piece of shit wrapped ina
piece of toilet paper.”

Morgan involuntarily LAUGHS. Claps a hand over her mouth.

PATEL (CONT'D)
This is funny? Death is funny to
you?

MORGAN
No, just... that’s how you go to
the bathroom?

Audrey starts quietly laughing too.

PATEL
Go ahead. Laugh. Meanwhile, I'11
tell you how many lives were lost
and will be lost because of you.

MORGAN
...So let me get this straight. You
take a piece of toilet paper and
what? You like wrap your hands in
it and then poop into it, and then
take that whole contraption and
that’s what you drop into the
toilet? You know the toilet is
designed to take all that work out
of it for you?

INT. CIA PARIS STATION. WENDY’S OFFICE - DAY
Wendy and Sebastian, as before.
WENDY
How long did the doctor say it
would take your arm to heal?
SEBASTIAN

Two months for the bullet wound.
Three for the fracture.
65.

WENDY
Great. Take a five month leave.

SEBASTIAN
Oh, I assume he meant the two arms
will heal simultaneously.

WENDY
I know what I said.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
Patel is in the middle of berating the girls. He leans in.

PATEL
And every time you hear the song
that will be recorded by Sting
(featuring Bruno Mars) about
everyone who’s about to be killed,
just know that that song would
never have had to be made if you
two weren’t such fuck-ups.

AUDREY
Okay. We get it.
PATEL
Oh, sorry, have you had enough?
(then)

Drew was right about you.
Audrey FLINCHES. Patel savors this.

PATEL (CONT'D)

You're nothing to him. Just a place
for him to put his stuff. Because
no one would ever suspect you of
anything. No one would ever think
you were important enough.

This hangs in the air for Audrey. The door opens and
SEBASTIAN re-enters. Avoids Patel, addresses the girls.

SEBASTIAN
I just wanted to say goodbye.
You're on the next flight to LA.

MORGAN
What happens when we get there? Are
we gonna go to jail?

SEBASTIAN
No, we’ll take care of it. That’s
what we do here.
66.

PATEL
Actually Henshaw, not to be a
grammarian here but you’re not
technically included in “we”
anymore when referring to what we
do here. Since you’re suspended.

Sebastian seethes but doesn’t say anything.

PATEL (CONT'D)
Now how about you drop these two at
the airport on your way home? Good
practice for your next career
driving a SuperShuttle.

I/E. TOYOTA COROLLA - DAY

Sebastian drives his modest car out of the parking garage.
Audrey sits shotgun, Morgan in the back.

SEBASTIAN
Sorry about all the dog hair back
there.

MORGAN

I’m surprised they don’t give you
more of a badass James Bond car.

SEBASTIAN
I don’t have company car privileges
right now. Or for the next five
months.

AUDREY
Ugh. We ruined your life.

SEBASTIAN
No you didn’t. I’1l be fine. And I
don’t know what Patel said to you
in there but this situation would
be much worse if you hadn’t flushed
that drive and it ended up in the
wrong hands.

MORGAN
But a lot of people are gonna die.

SEBASTIAN
And they would have died if you'd
never found the drive in the first
place. This is not your fault.

A moment.
67.

AUDREY
Just out of curiosity, if we did
still have the drive, what would
have happened?

SEBASTIAN
Well, hopefully we could de-encrypt
it. Then ideally, we’d see what
Highland’s plans are and stop them.

AUDREY
How do you de-encrypt something?

SEBASTIAN
Why do you want to know?

AUDREY
(a nervous beat)
Because the drive is in my vagina.

SEBASTIAN
Sorry?

AUDREY
Yeah...

Sebastian and Morgan are SHOCKED.

Wait.

SEBASTIAN MORGAN
Are you fucking kidding?!

AUDREY
You told me it was important! I’m
not going to flush something that
important down the toilet!

MORGAN
So it’s in there right now? Doesn’t
that hurt?

AUDREY

You get used to it.

SEBASTIAN
So even when you were being
tortured... you didn’t give it up.

Sebastian is really impressed with Audrey.

MORGAN
The ultimate irony would be if you
saved the world, then died of Toxic
Shock Syndrome.
68.

SEBASTIAN
Right then, not to be impolite but
do you think you might... access
it? From... the place where--

AUDREY
Yeah. Everyone turn your head.

ANGLE on AUDREY’S FACE as she unzips, removes the flash
drive. A moment, then another ZIP. She holds out the drive.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Should I just put it...

SEBASTIAN
Uh, I’11 take that.

An awkward -- and extremely intimate -- moment as Audrey
hands the drive to Sebastian. He puts it on the dash, then
turns off at an exit for CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT.

MORGAN
Where are you going after this?
Back to headquarters or whatever?

AUDREY
Yeah. I’m sure they’1l un-suspend
you if you show up with this.

SEBASTIAN
Maybe. But I may try to take this
one on myself.

AUDREY
How? Look at you. You're like,
disabled right now.

SEBASTIAN
I'll figure something out.

A moment. Audrey and Morgan exchange a look.

AUDREY
Dude, no. I’m not gonna sit on the
plane watching Cake Boss while
you're risking your life to clean
up a mess we made. I want to help.

MORGAN
Me too. You can’t do this alone.

SEBASTIAN
No. No. You two have risked your
lives enough as it is.

A moment. Then the other part of the truth comes out.
69.

MORGAN
But... I don’t want to go back yet.

AUDREY
Me neither. This might sound stupid
because this is your job and it's
really serious and dangerous, but I
feel like this is something we
could actually be... good at.

MORGAN
I know. This is everything I love
about theater and I’m finally
getting to do it. Just pretending
to be a spy.

SEBASTIAN
You're not pretending.

Sebastian DOES AN AGGRESSIVE U-TURN. New plan.

EXT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY

A gorgeous historical library on the Seine facing the LOUVRE.
INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY

Breathtaking details, centuries-old books. A tourist
destination. But these are no ordinary tourists.

The READING ROOM -- Sebastian inserts the FLASH DRIVE into
his laptop while the girls look on. The same ENCRYPTED
numbers and letters that appeared in the Apple Store pop up.

SEBASTIAN
Hmmmm. That’s odd.

He LOOKS DOWN AT THE DRIVE. Then back at Audrey. Then back at
the DRIVE. Audrey gets paranoid about what he’s judging.

AUDREY
Whatever dude. Not every woman is
like, a waxed porn star. We have
stuff going on in there.

SEBASTIAN
No, no. I mean on the drive... this
is State Department encryption.

MORGAN
Meaning?

SEBASTIAN
Highland didn’t make this. Your
government did. I can’t access it. I
don’t have clearance. I’m suspended.
70.

AUDREY
can’t you just hack the password?
You're a spy.

SEBASTIAN
They change it every 24 hours. It’s
16 characters. Numbers, letters,
case-sensitive. Even if I hada
supercomputer, it would take days.

AUDREY
So... what are you saying?

SEBASTIAN
We can’t get into the flash drive.
I’m saying we lost.

A sober moment for all of them.

MORGAN
There must be something else we can
do.

SEBASTIAN

Not unless you have access to some
sort of expert on U.S. intelligence
computer security.

Morgan gets an idea.

MORGAN
Actually, hold on.

INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - NIGHT

Two FRENCH STUDENTS absorbed in MATH TEXTBOOKS. Around them,
the usual student technology -- laptops, mobiles, etc. Morgan
appears at their table. In her best French accent --

MORGAN
Ou est la bibliothéque?

They students are confused.

FRENCH STUDENT
You're already at the library.

MORGAN
Yeah, sorry, it’s the only thing I
remember from high school French.
(then)
I’m just gonna borrow this for one
second. Be right back.

She grabs one of their MOBILES and steps outside.
71.

INT. MOSCOW HOTEL - DAY- INTERCUT

The back of someone’s head, staring out the window at the
KREMLIN as he ties a TIE. His phone buzzes. He looks at the
number, doesn’t recognize it, but answers it anyway.

EDWARD SNOWDEN
This is Edward.

MORGAN
Eddie? Eddie Snowden?

Yes -- it’s EDWARD SNOWDEN.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
It’s Morgan. From Buck’s Rock Camp.

Edward Snowden loses his shit.

EDWARD
Oh my God, Morgan! How are you?
It’s been forever. I’ve sent you a
bunch of emails over the years... I
thought maybe you didn’t have your
AOL account anymore.

MORGAN
Yeah, I have a Gmail now.

EDWARD SNOWDEN
Actually... I knew that.

MORGAN
Right. I guess you would.
(beat)
So hey. I need a really big favor.

A knock at Edward’s hotel room door. A RUSSIAN AIDE appears.

RUSSIAN AIDE
Sir, Mr. Putin is ready for you.

EDWARD SNOWDEN
He can wait.
(into phone)
What do you need, Morgan? Anything.

MORGAN
Are you near a computer?

EDWARD SNOWDEN
Always.

INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM - DAY

In the SITUATION ROOM, Wendy stares at the screens. Silence.
Then a CIA TECHNICIAN notices something on his computer.
72.

CIA TECHNICIAN
Ma’am! Ma’am.
(Wendy looks over)
They didn’t get on their flight.

WENDY
Shit.

She turns to PATEL.

WENDY (CONT’D)
Either those dum-dums took their
selfie sticks to the Eiffel Tower
or they lied about not having the
drive and they’re on the run. Which
agent took them to the airport?

Patel freezes. He fucked up.

PATEL
I, uh, sent Henshaw.

WENDY
You sent the agent I just suspended
for insubordination?

PATEL
I'll fix it.

WENDY
You’d better. Give me an excuse to
leave couples therapy early. I’m
sick of watching my husband cry.

INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - DAY
Sebastian types in the password Morgan reads off...

MORGAN
...Two, upper case L, at sign, at
sign, asterisk, lower-case j...

ON THE SCREEN: A CHECK MARK.

Sebastian and Audrey exchange a look, amazed. Sebastian
hastily downloads the de-encryption key. He’s in.

INT. BIBLIOTHEQUE MAZARINE - LATER
Morgan is now trying desperately to wrap it up with Snowden.

MORGAN
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. I love the
Mighty Mighty Bosstones too. Makes
sense that they’re touring Eastern
Europe now... I’1l definitely try
to make it.

(MORE )
73.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
But if I can’t, call me if you’re
ever in LA!... Oh right, I guess I
knew that. K then... bye.

She hangs up on Edward Snowden.

ON SEBASTIAN’S LAPTOP: ICONS flood the screen and don’t stop.
There must be millions. Sebastian's eyes widen.

AUDREY

What? What’s on the drive.
SEBASTIAN

These... aren’t Highland’s plans.

This is a lot bigger.
Sebastian SLAMS THE LAPTOP SHUT just as Morgan returns.

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
We have to get out of here.

INT. EUROPEAN HOTEL ROOM - SUNSET - INTERCUT

In a lavish bed in a luxury hotel in Europe somewhere sits --
NADEDJA. She’s still alive? What the fuck?

Her PROFILE, haunting beauty, lit by the sunset. She’s stone-
faced, chain smoking, surrounded by artillery. EURO MTV plays
low in the background but she stares out the window. Her CELL
buzzes. She answers in CROATIAN.

NADEDJA
Zdravo.

A VOICE speaks through a VOICE MODULATOR.

VOICE MODULATOR
I need to add another target.

NADEDJA
Double rate.

VOICE MODULATOR
No. You failed once. The girls are
still alive. You should be happy
we're still working with you. I’1l
send you everything you need.

We stay on NADEDJA as her A TEXT comes through. A picture of
SEBASTIAN. Then, LINK to GOOGLE MAPS with a MOVING DOT.

Nadedja turns to assemble her weapons -- and we reveal --
HALF HER FACE IS MELTED OFF. Hideously deformed. The bombing
at the ice rink. Well... she’s survived worse.
74.

EXT. SUBURBAN PARIS SHOPPING CENTRE PARKING LOT - DAY

By the parked Corolla, Sebastian switches the SIM CARD in his
phone -- opens the TRUNK, pulls out DRY CLEANING.

SEBASTIAN
Here. Change your clothes. We need
to ditch anything they could use to
find out where we’re going.

AUDREY
Where are we going?

SEBASTIAN
Amsterdam. I know a place we can
hide.

As they all put on Sebastian’s DRESS SHIRTS...

MORGAN

Oh my God my friend Beth lives in
Amsterdam! She just emailed me
about a new gallery show.

(to Sebastian)
She uses pipe cleaners and glitter
to discuss draconian abortion
access in contemporary India.

SEBASTIAN
Interesting. Do you want your
friend Beth to die?

MORGAN
I wasn’t saying we should go.
(beat)
Unless we get this all resolved and
we're safe. Then I wouldn’t mind
supporting her.

Meanwhile, Audrey tries not to stare at Sebastian’s body as
she helps him button his shirt. Dude’s in great shape. He
catches her looking. An awkward moment as they both redden.
There’s tension -- and not just the life and death kind.

A series of QUICK CUTS, over energetic music --

-Morgan THROWS ALL THEIR CLOTHES into a DUMPSTER.

-Sebastian pulls a stash of SPY SHIT -- MONEY, PASSPORTS,
GUNS, GADGETS, A PACK OF CIGARETTES -- from his glove box...

-Sebastian walks Morgan through JIMMYING the lock on another
car, a modest PEUGEOT HATCHBACK. Then through hot-wiring it.

EXT. FRENCH HIGHWAY - MINUTES LATER

The Peugeot zips out on to the road. Success.
75.

I/E. A PARIS TRAIN - NIGHT

NADEDJA in a CLOSED TRAIN CAR -- bad side facing away from
us, toward the window. She tracks the moving DOT.

KNOCK KNOCK! A sleazy SPANISH GUY slides the door open.

SPANISH GUY
Good evening, beautiful.

He sits next to her. Nadedja blithely turns, revealing the
other side of her face -- now bandaged but SOAKED WITH BLOOD.

SPANISH GUY (CONT’D)
Bella, what happened to your face?

Nadedja calmly lifts a hand and BASHES HIS NOSE IN. Amused:

NADEDJA
What happened to yours?

I/E. SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Sebastian and Audrey up front, Morgan sleeping in back.

AUDREY

So what kind of dog do you have?
SEBASTIAN

Well, had.
AUDREY

Oh. I’m sorry.

SEBASTIAN
No. No. The dog’s still alive. He
just lives with my ex.

AUDREY
Do you ever see him?... Or her? Or,
sorry, maybe they’re both “him,” I
don’t mean to be presumptuous.

SEBASTIAN
The dog’s a “he.” The ex is a “she.”

AUDREY
Got it. What happened?

SEBASTIAN
You know. The usual. I worked too
much. We never saw each other. She
was having an emotional affair with
one of her coworkers. They were
always hugging. They once hugged
for five minutes.

(MORE )
76.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Just try to hug someone for five
minutes. I bet you can’t.

AUDREY
Yeah, that’s a really long time.

SEBASTIAN
Also I found out she was selling
weapons to the Chinese government.

AUDREY
Where is she now?

SEBASTIAN
Off the grid. I lost track of her --
and Banjo -- somewhere along the

Kyrgyzstan border.

AUDREY
I’m really sorry.

SEBASTIAN
Yeah. Breakups suck. As you know.

A moment of connection.

AUDREY
They just make you feel crazy.
Like, you're with someone for ten
months, you think you’re in love...
then you’re like, oh wait, that was
all a lie. I was just a vagina for
him to store a flash drive in.

SEBASTIAN
It’s more complicated than that.
People reveal who they are in the
end. It doesn’t mean what you had
wasn’t real.

AUDREY
Morgan says Drew was always a
selfish dick.

SEBASTIAN
And what do you think?

AUDREY
I mean, he did bring assassins to
my apartment. But then again, so

did you.
SEBASTIAN
(smiling)
Shut up.

In the back, MORGAN wakes up.
77.

MORGAN
Hey guys? I know we’re on the run
from a shit-ton of people but can
we eat soon? I’m fucking starving.
EXT. ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS - DAY
The sun rises over the gorgeous town.
ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS
INT. AN OFFICE - DAY
Long, thin fingers type into a PHONE.

“Targets located.”

NADEDJA stands in a corporate office -- empty for the weekend
-- overlooking a quaint outdoor cafe. Through her SCOPE...

EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE - SAME

AUDREY, MORGAN and SEBASTIAN eat breakfast - in her
CROSSHAIRS.

We leave Nadedja’s POV and pull closer... revealing...

It’s NOT THEM. It’s the AUSTRALIAN TOURIST GIRLS they stole
passports from in Vienna. And some RANDOM SKEEVY GUY. One of
the girls wears SEBASTIAN’S JACKET FROM EARLIER.

AUSSIE TOURIST 1
How cute is this jacket?

AUSSIE TOURIST 2
I can’t believe you found it ina
dumpster. You always find the best
secondhand stuff.

SKEEVY GUY
Yeah, so, you guys into threesomes?

BAM-BAM-BAM! All three collapse, instantly dead --
EXT. A DIFFERENT CAFE - DAY

In an entirely different CAFE, our three heroes eat Dutch
apple pancakes in peace. Totally safe. For now.

AUDREY
So Sebastian, is this what your job
is like all the time?

SEBASTIAN
Uh, no. Mostly it’s a lot of
paperwork. Reading reports. Waiting
to get sent into the field.
78.

AUDREY
At least you have a field. My field
is a conveyor belt with almond milk
and cruelty-free chicken coming at
me. Reeeeally slowly. With plenty
of time for me to intercept them.

MORGAN
I’ve never had a job. But I love
hearing about jobs. Maybe I should
get a job here serving pannekoeken.
I do a really good Dutch accent.
Audrey knows.

AUDREY
She played a guard in Diary of Anne
Frank.

MORGAN

The part was written as a man but
at Oberlin we did a Gender-Switch
version.

On Sebastian -- what the fuck are they talking about?

AUDREY
Speaking of hiding out, where are
we staying tonight? Do we finally
get to sleep in a real hotel?

MORGAN
Yeah, like one of those ones in
Bond where there just happens to be
a private waterfall for him to have
sex under?

SEBASTIAN

No. We need to stay somewhere we

won’t stand out. Where we don’t

seem weird. Because everyone there

will be weirder.

SMASH TO:
INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL, AMSTERDAM - NIGHT
A grimy YOUTH HOSTEL. Full of freaks. A JAPANESE GUY plays
with a POSSUM. A SWISS GUY openly sells COCAINE. A THRUPLE of
IRISH TOURISTS make out.
AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS

At the check-in desk, Sebastian hands cash to a clerk.
79.

INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

Sebastian sits on one of the beds, on his laptop while Audrey
looks on. Morgan, on another bed, channel-surfs on the tiny
TV. On the tiny DESK, an assortment of GUNS is laid out.

AUDREY
...So you’re telling me this drive
gives us access to the entire
Cloud? Everyone's private shit?

SEBASTIAN
The U.S. government has built a
back door to access everything.
Everyone’s private emails, their
finances... everyone’s secrets.
That’s what Drew stole.

AUDREY
What does Highland want with that?

SEBASTIAN
Imagine the power that comes from
unlimited information. Blackmail,
theft, they can take anything. Know
anything. This is why people are --

MORGAN
Hey! You guys!

On TV: CNN INTERNATIONAL NEWS. It’s a story about AMERICAN
GIRLS ARMED, DANGEROUS, AT LARGE. It’s Audrey and Morgan.

CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR
...Thought to be part of a bigger
terrorist plot, the young women
were said to be involved in a hack
at the Apple Store in Prague...

The girls stare, mesmerized...

CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (CONT’D)
.»..and the murder of a local doctor,
which may have had a sexual motive.

MORGAN
Ew. We would not have sexual
motives with that guy. That’s like,
so insulting to us.

CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR
Here are recent photographs of the
suspects...

ON THE TV: Morgan’s photo is a glamorous headshot. Audrey's
is a drunken, shiny bar photo. Baggy, stained sweatshirt.
Sebastian

80.

AUDREY
Ugh, I keep trying to untag myself
in that picture.

MORGAN

Was that from Halloween?
AUDREY

No.
MORGAN

Oh.

(beat)

It’s cute!

AUDREY

It’s really not.

MORGAN
Sebastian, back me up here. Doesn’t
Audrey look cute in that photo?

SEBASTIAN
I’m busy.

MORGAN
What, you don’t have one second to
validate her? All you have to do is
give a thumbs up or thumbs down!

CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR
...The FBI has released transcripts
of Facebook messages between the
suspects about victim Drew Thayer,
confirming their intent.

AUDREY
Oh God. Morgan. Our chats...

CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR
“I just wish he would die. Is that
too much to ask? Just for someone
to [expletive] murder him,” said
Audrey Stockman. Then, “Do you want
me to murder him? I totally will.
That’s what friends are for. Music
note emoji, music note emoji,”
replied Morgan Freedman.

finally looks up, amused.

SEBASTIAN
Your name is Morgan Freedman?

MORGAN
It’s Morgan Alexa Freedman on IMDB.
81.

AUDREY
Oh God. Morgan. Look.

Onscreen - TESS BAKER-TONETTI: COLLEGE FRIEND OF SUSPECT.

TESS
...-Honestly? I just don’t believe
Audrey would ever do this.

Audrey is surprised and weirdly touched. Until...

TESS (CONT'D)
She’s just like, not that
complicated of a thinker. I mean
she’s 27 years old and she doesn’t
even have a bed frame.

Audrey shuts off the TV. She and Morgan cross to Sebastian.

MORGAN
So with this drive, if anyone had
ever emailed or like iMessaged a
naked picture to someone else...

SEBASTIAN
This drive could access it.
AUDREY
Who did you send naked pictures to?
MORGAN
Don’t worry about it.
AUDREY
I can find out. He just said I can

find out.
Audrey grabs the LAPTOP. Morgan smacks her hands away.
MORGAN
Or we could look at pictures of
someone we actually want to see
naked.

The girls exchange a knowing look. Beat.

MORGAN (CONT’D) AUDREY
Anderson Cooper. Amal Clooney.
Morgan starts typing... Sebastian tries to wrestle the laptop

back but she playfully holds it out of his reach.

SEBASTIAN
Guys. This is not a joke...

ONSCREEN -- A NAKED ANDERSON COOPER. Reverent silence.
82.

MORGAN
God. Everything about that guy is
chiseled.

AUDREY
Snow white carpet, snow white
drapes.

MORGAN
Ooh, is that one from behind?

AUDREY
Anderson Cooper 360.

Suddenly -- An ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER bursts into the
room!

ALL THREE OF THEM PANIC, SCRAMBLE FOR THEIR GUNS. Point it
right at the backpacker... who is totally non-plussed.

ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
(thick accent)
Cool.

He plops on one of the beds and immediately falls asleep.
INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL BATHROOM - LATER

Audrey enters the communal bathroom to find Sebastian
unwrapping a KID’S travel toothbrush. She does the same.

AUDREY
What’d you get? I got the blond
girl from Frozen.

SEBASTIAN

That’s Elsa. You can have my Olaf
if you'd prefer.

(off her look)
I have nieces.

(beat)
Who are quite weirded out that I
saw Frozen in the theater three
times by myself.

Audrey laughs. They switch toothbrushes, brush their teeth.

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
I hope you’re not upset about what
that girl said. On the news.

AUDREY
I mean, I’m not surprised she said
that. I haven’t really done
anything that impressive with my
life so far.
A moment.

83.

SEBASTIAN
I’ve seen you do some pretty
impressive things. You were a great
shot in the cafe. You didn’t break
when you were tortured. You had the
forethought to put that thing up
your... thing. You’re a natural at
this.

AUDREY
You think so?

SEBASTIAN
Absolutely.

AUDREY
Well, I’m impressed with you too.
Not a lot of people would've cared
about saving me. Including my ex.

SEBASTIAN
Audrey. About that. I want to clear
something up. You weren’t just a
cover for Drew. That much I know.

AUDREY
How?
SEBASTIAN
I was... there the night you two

met. At your birthday last year.

AUDREY
You were at Barcade?

SEBASTIAN
Outside. In the surveillance van.
Drew was actually there to take out
a target.

AUDREY
Who?

SEBASTIAN
The bartender. He was in ISIS.

INT. BARCADE - NIGHT( FLASHBACK)

A BARTENDER with a VERY LONG BEARD -- could be in Isis, could
be in Iron & Wine -- hands DREW a drink at the bar.

ISIS BARTENDER
Craft Bourbon Cocktail with tobacco
bitters and a rhubarb zest?
84.

We hear Sebastian in V.O. through Drew’s earpiece.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Can you identify him as the target?

Drew’s leans back to get a better view, knocking into Audrey
at the jukebox. He turns, sees her. Smiles. She’s cute.

DREW
Sorry.

AUDREY
It’s okay.

From DREW'S SIDE NOW, we see Audrey turn around in her TIARA.

DREW
Oh. Happy birthday.

AUDREY
What?
(off tiara, deadpan)
Oh, this? It’s not my birthday. I
just wear this for warmth.

INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK

Sebastian sits with TWO OTHER AGENTS, watching FOOTAGE of
different areas of the bar. ONSCREEN, Drew and Audrey flirt.

SEBASTIAN

Thayer. We do not have time for
this.

(Drew ignores him)
Thayer. Show me you’re listening to
me.

(Drew keeps ignoring him)
Tell me this earptece is still
working. Or I’m coming in there.

They start dancing. Drew subtly NODS over Audrey’s shoulder.
SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
If you see me, why aren’t you
fucking moving?!
INT. BARCADE - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
MORGAN approaches the dancing couple.
MORGAN
Okay, kids. The birthday girl’s
gonna turn into a pumpkin ina
second. Let’s get Del Taco.

Audrey and Drew break apart. Morgan addresses Drew.
85.

MORGAN (CONT’D)
You’re coming. You can bring your
giant square chin with you.

AUDREY
No night is complete without a bad
decision at Del Taco.

DREW
Actually... I can’t.

AUDREY
Oh. Okay.

She’s disappointed. Drew glances back at ISIS BARTENDER, now
closing out the register. Preparing to leave...

DREW

I just, have a work thing.
AUDREY

At 2am?
DREW

Yeah, my job is weird.
This sounds like bullshit.

AUDREY
Okay, well, nice meeting you, Drew.

She turns to leave. ON DREW -- glancing from the BARTENDER
retreating to the BATHROOM and AUDREY on her way out...

DREW
Wait.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)

Don’t you dare give her your
number. Do not give a witness at
the bar where you’re about to
murder a man your phone number.

DREW
(sotto)
Too Late.
Audrey turns.
AUDREY

Too late for what?

DREW
Nothing. Here. Take my number.
Maybe we can hang out another time.
86.
Audrey lights up, hands him her phone. He punches in his
number. Audrey leaves with Morgan.
The second they’re gone, Drew SPRINTS TOWARD THE BATHROOM.
INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
The agents watch as onscreen, in the BATHROOM --
ISIS BARTENDER is finishing up at the urinal. Drew walks in.
INT. BARCADE BATHROOM - NIGHT- (FLASHBACK
Drew, now steely-eyed, expertly moves toward him, grabs the
back of his head -- shoves him hard right INTO THE FLUSHER
HANDLE. We SMASH BACK TO --
INT. HOSTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT- PRESENT DAY

Audrey and Sebastian, as before. Audrey is overwhelmed.

SEBASTIAN
My point is, being with someone --
caring about them -- makes our job
harder. So if Drew was trying with
you... that was real.

AUDREY

Until I got him killed.

SEBASTIAN
He got himself killed.

A moment. Sebastian tries to lighten the mood.

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
And not that you asked my opinion,
but I would say the worst song on
that jukebox is “Your Body is a
Wonderland.” No question.

AUDREY
(laughing)
No way dude! I lost my virginity to
that song.

SEBASTIAN
Wow. To who? The cheesiest person
in the world?

AUDREY
Oh, I’m sorry. Did you lose your
virginity in a non-cheesy way,
Fancy British Guy?

Now Sebastian’s laughing too. They’re enjoying each other.
Audrey turns to leave... then turns back.
87.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Hey. Why didn’t you let us die?
Before.

SEBASTIAN
I just thought you had value.

We see this means a lot to Audrey. And clearly there’s a
mutual attraction. Another charged moment between them...

Until THE ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER bursts in.

ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
Rookworst, am I right?

He slams into a stall. The SOUNDS of a really large man
having really an explosive shit. And the moment is gone.

INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Sebastian and Audrey are mid-conversation, laughing, as they
walk back into the room.

AUDREY
There are a_ lot of Jim Morrison
posters in Amsterdam.

SEBASTIAN AUDREY (CONT'D)
God I hate the Doors. Fucking hate the Doors.

They laugh. Then Sebastian suddenly stops. FREEZES.

SEBASTIAN
Audrey.

Audrey turns, GASPS-- Morgan is BOUND AND GAGGED in the middle
of the room -- strapped to a CHAIR -- tied to the DESK.

AUDREY
Oh my God! Morgan, what--—

A VOICE (0.S.)
She talks too much.

It’s PATEL.

He emerges from behind the door -- GUN trained on them.

Fuck.

Sebastian acts lightning-quick, on instinct. He SWINGS at
Patel with his unslinged arm -- but he’s injured, weakened.
Patel easily bats him away -- then shoves the muzzle of the
PISTOL into Sebastian’s shoulder -- into his RAW BULLET HOLE.

Sebastian SCREAMS in pain.
AUDREY
Stop! Please! Don’t! Stop it --

88.

Patel just pushes harder, harder. Sebastian WRITHES. Audrey
STEPS FORWARD to intervene, but he whips the gun back to her.

PATEL
Hands! Up. Both of you.
(to Sebastian)
That’s both hands, cripple.

Audrey and Sebastian raise their arms. Sebastian winces -- he

can’t raise his injured arm very high. Patel notices,

PATEL (CONT'D)
Higher.

Sebastian tries. It’s excruciating.

PATEL (CONT'D)
...dust because I can.

SEBASTIAN
What is this, Patel? Revenge? I was
already suspended. You won.

PATEL
I know I won. This isn’t about you.
Or them. I’m just here for this.

smirks.

Patel moves to the desk -- reaches over a whimpering Morgan --

slides the FLASH DRIVE from the computer.

PATEL (CONT'D)
Of course, now I have a couple of
loose ends to tie up.

He retrains the GUN on Sebastian, point blank...

AUDREY
Wait! None of this is his fault,
okay? It’s mine. This was all me
and Morgan. Just tell the CIA that.

SEBASTIAN
Audrey, no...
(to Patel)
He’s not here on CIA business. He’s
working for Highland.

PATEL
Please. Highland works for me. And
you won’t believe how much the
Chinese Mafia is offering me for
this thing. And the Russian Mafia.
Multiple mafias.
89.

SEBASTIAN
So this is all about money?

PATEL
Money, justice, whatever you want
to call it. I personally think it’s
unjust that I risk death every day
and sacrifice any shred of a
personal life to make sixty five
grand a year and wear a suit from
Men’s Wearhouse. And on that note,
I’1l just finish you all and be on
my way. As much fun as it’s been
watching you kids play Tinker
Tailor Stoner Spy.

Patel waits for a reaction. Nothing. Audrey’s incredulous.

AUDREY
What, were you hoping to get a
laugh? You’re about to kill us.

PATEL
I was on the Lampoon in college.
Whatever. I’m funny. Doesn't
matter. Cause one thing’s mightier
than the pen and it’s called a
fucking handgun. For heckling me,
princess, you die first.

Patel moves the gun to AUDREY’S TEMPLE... hand on the
trigger... SQUEEZING. SQUEEZING. A tense final second, AND --

Patel GASPS and DROPS to the ground, DEAD! The ENORMOUS
FINNISH BACKPACKER stands behind him. He leans down, pulls
his BLOODY KNIFE from Patel’s back.

SEBASTIAN
Jesus!

AUDREY
Oh my God.

Shell-shocked, Audrey rushes to Morgan and UNPEELS the tape.
They hug, both messes of emotion.

MORGAN
Thank you. Oh my God, thank you.

ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
This man was robbing us, yes?

SEBASTIAN
Yes.

ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER
He might have stolen Angelika.
90.

He unzips his backpack. A GIANT YELLOW SNAKE SLITHERS OUT.

ENORMOUS FINNISH BACKPACKER (CONT’D)
Just ignore her. She’1ll take
herself for a walk.

He climbs back into his bed, puts the knife down on the sill,
closes his eyes. The snake slithers over Patel’s dead body.

Everyone is a little disgusted. But they don’t dare complain
after what he just did for them. Morgan turns to Sebastian.

MORGAN
So what now?

SEBASTIAN
First, we have to move this body.

INT. FLYING PIG YOUTH HOSTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

Morgan and Audrey carry a blanket-wrapped SOMETHING -- it’s
clearly a body -- through the lobby. Sebastian in tow. There
are just a couple of people there. They’re all suspicious.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Just act like everything we’re
doing is normal and no one will
question it. People only suspect
you when you look like you’re
trying to hide something. Smile.
Make eye contact. Say hi.

Morgan and Audrey take the note too far, smiling and saying
hello to EVERY PERSON they pass. A SLEAZY GUY by the desk
smiles back at Morgan. Gives her a little nod - ‘Sup girl.
EXT. AMSTERDAM STREET - NIGHT

Sebastian hot-wires a BLACK SEDAN as Audrey and Morgan ease
Patel’s body into the trunk.

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)

We need a clean car. Then we need
to get out of the city.

I/E. BLACK SEDAN - NIGHT
Audrey drives. Sebastian’s shotgun. Morgan in the back.

AUDREY
How did he find us?

SEBASTIAN
We took every precaution. We used
cash. No phones --
91.

Then Audrey realizes something. Turns back to Morgan. Morgan
quickly looks out the window. Audrey realizes.

AUDREY
Morgan, did you call your parents?!

MORGAN
I’m sorry! I just had to tell them
I was okay! I thought maybe my dad
found out about Roger and I didn’t
want them to think I was dead so I
got a burner phone at the gift shop
and just said hey I’m fine -- real
fast -- then I threw it ina
dumpster! Like on The Wire! I
thought you couldn’t track a call
if it was less than two minutes!

SEBASTIAN
That’s not a thing anymore.

MORGAN
I realize that now.

SEBASTIAN
Morgan. Listen to me. You cannot do
any more shit like that. You put
all of our lives in jeopardy.

MORGAN
I’m sorry! But it’s not like I’m the
only one of us who fucked up.

SEBASTIAN
Who else fucked up?

MORGAN
You left the drive in the computer?

SEBASTIAN
Just for a second! You were in the
room! Where else would I put it?!

MORGAN
What’s wrong with your ass?!

SEBASTIAN
My ass? I couldn’t have done that
with my arm like this! I wouldn’t
have been able to get the angle.

AUDREY
You could have asked one of us to
help you insert it. I was in the
bathroom with you.
92.

MORGAN
Yeah. I’m sure Audrey would have
loved to put something up your ass!
I’m sure she still would.

AUDREY
(reddening)
Not in a sexual way. Just like, for
the sake of mankind.

EXT. NDSM WHARF, OUTSIDE AMSTERDAM - NIGHT

An abandoned industrial area by the waterfront under the
cover of night. The girls fill Patel’s pockets with ROCKS.

The girls lower Patel into the water. As body slowly sinks, a
CELL PHONE BUZZES. PATEL’s. It’s coming from under the
blanket. It’s on him. The girls freeze, set the body down.

SEBASTIAN
We need to check who he’s texting.

Audrey takes a breath, and wades into the water. His dead
face stares back at her. She winces, reaches into his jacket,
removes the phone before it gets wet. Slides to unlock it.

AUDREY
The phone needs his thumbprint.

MORGAN
Well... there’s his thumb.

Audrey grabs Patel’s dead arm. She presses thumb to button.
The phone unlocks. There’s a TEXT from an unknown number:

“Text me when you get the package.”
AUDREY
What do I say back? Who is he
texting with?
SEBASTIAN
Let’s find out. Tell them we have
it and ask them where the drop is.
She writes back. A moment, then another BUZZ.
“Bring it to Operation Albrecht.”

AUDREY
What’s “Operation Albrecht”?

SEBASTIAN
Let’s check his emails.
93.

Sebastian pulls the DRIVE and laptop from his bag. Inserts
the drive, kneels on the dirty ground, laptop on his knee...

ONSCREEN -- PATEL’S EMAILS. He searches “Albrecht.”

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
He’s been emailing with someone
named “Hunter Pierce.”

MORGAN
Okay, so, a gay porn star.

SEBASTIAN
“Operation Albrecht” appears to be
Highland’s first planned
assassination. They don’t name the
target, but it’s going down
tomorrow night. There’s a gala at
the Museum of German Technology in
Berlin. Text back and tell him
you'll be there with the drive.

AUDREY
Shit. It locked again.

Audrey uses Patel’s thumb again, replies. Meanwhile--

SEBASTIAN
Wow, Patel has a lot of pictures of
his mom on here.

ON THE SCREEN -- Photos of PATEL and an OLDER WOMAN.

where they’re BOTH NAKED AND MAKING OUT.

MORGAN
Ahh. Not his mom! Not his mom!
AUDREY
Wait!

That person’s gonna keeps texting.
We'll need his thumb.

sinks. Audrey grabs it -- uses the

glass as a BLADE, CUTS PATEL’S THUMB OFF. Not much blood.

She holds up the thumb to her cohorts in victory. It’s
disgusting, but we see Audrey is also weirdly proud of
herself. She really is a natural at this.
94.

EXT. BERLIN - DAY
The sun rises over Berlin.
BERLIN, GERMANY
SEBASTIAN (V.O.)

Here’s the plan. The guest list for
the gala includes the Canadian
ambassador and his wife. Audrey,
you and I will pose as them.

INT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - CUSTOMS - DAY

 

Passengers deplane, hug family, pick up their bags.

AUDREY (V.O.)
Won’t people know what they look
like?

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
No. No one ever remembers what
Canadians look like... They land at
Tegel Airport at 2pm.

At BAGGAGE CLAIM -- a GENERICALLY HANDSOME MAN and his PLAIN
BLOND WIFE walk briskly towards... A SIGN with their NAMES on
it: “AMBASSADOR AND MRS. MULLICAY.” Pan up--

The DRIVER HOLDING IT is MORGAN. In a hat and everything.

MORGAN (V.O.)
Can I do an accent?

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
You don’t need to.

MORGAN (V.O.)
Nah, I’m gonna do an accent. I know
what I’m gonna do. “To really
inhabit a character, you must speak
with their tongue.” Stanislavsky.

She takes the couple’s carry-ons. In a THICK COCKNEY ACCENT:
MORGAN
‘ELLO. Funny coincidence -- you two
is from London, Ontario and me, I’m
from Jolly Old London! England.
The Canadians are taken aback.

EXT. TEGEL AIRPORT - PARKING GARAGE ROOF - DAY

 

Morgan leads them to a LIMO in a corner of the EMPTY roof. It
wasn’t necessary to park this far. The Canadians exchange
glances but don’t say anything because they’re Canadian.
95.

INT. LIMO - MOMENTS LATER
Morgan turns on the engine and opens the sunroof...

AUDREY -- suddenly on TOP OF THE CAR -- sticks her head down
into it! The Canadians SCREAM. Morgan feigns SHOCK too.

MORGAN
Oh my! Rascal! Ruffian! Begone!

Audrey shoots the couple with TRANQ DARTS. They pass out.

AUDREY
Have a nice nap, guys. Sorry you'll
miss the party.

INT. GERMAN REST STOP BATHROOM - DAY

A dingy public bathroom. Audrey DYES HER HAIR BLOND in the
sink to MATCH THE CANADIAN WOMAN’S. Morgan dyes her hair RED.

AUDREY
Do I look like her?

MORGAN
Yeah. Do I look awesome?

AUDREY
You look cute.

MORGAN
I just feel like for our
friendship, we should be changing
our looks at the same time. You to
a Canadian Ambassador’s wife and me
to a young Julianne Moore.

EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - NIGHT

A stunning modern glass-walled building with a GOLDEN PLANE
on top. Fancy couples walk up a RED CARPET to the GRAND
ENTRANCE, manned by SECURITY.

From behind, we follow a MAN in a TUXEDO, and a BLOND WOMAN
in a RED SATIN DRESS and HEELS. We move around them... It’s
Sebastian and Audrey. They look amazing. Throughout this
sequence, Sebastian, Audrey and Morgan will be able to hear
each other on earpieces.

SEBASTIAN
Morgan, are you in position?

EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - BACK DOOR - INTERCUT

Morgan is dressed in a LAVENDER UNITARD. Acrobats in matching
unitards stretch and warm up. Morgan stretches with them.
96.

MORGAN
I was born in position.

AUDREY
Everyone was born in position.
That’s why they call it “the fetal
position.”

MORGAN
Oh, I just put that together. But
yes. I’m psyched about this.
Performing with Cirque de Soleil is
like, a top three dream. I was a
Cc.I.T. in Acrobatics and Clowning at
camp. It was competitive.

SEBASTIAN
Once again, Morgan, you are not
performing with the troupe. Your
job is to stay backstage and watch
the surveillance. We have to locate
the assassin.

MORGAN
What about just for one song?

SEBASTIAN
No.

Morgan longingly eyes a LITHE MAN doing a warm-up back flip.

MORGAN
This is like taking a thoroughbred
to the Kentucky Derby and telling
him, “you have to stand here and
watch the Kentucky Derby, Horse.”

Sebastian addresses the Marines in a PERFECT CANADIAN ACCENT.

SEBASTIAN
Evening! Honey, you have our
passports?

Audrey proffers the Canadians’ passports. The Marine surveys
them. Looks back to Sebastian and Audrey. A tense moment.
Then he waves them through. As they enter the party...

AUDREY
That was a perfect Canadian accent.

SEBASTIAN
I watch a lot of Degrassi.

AUDREY
Really?!
97.

SEBASTIAN
(dumb bro accent)
Naw -- it’s my training, dumbass.
(then)
That was my LA accent.

AUDREY
Shut it.

SEBASTIAN
You look good as a blond, by the
way. And are you wearing lipstick?
Hearing this, MORGAN smiles as she mans --

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

 

-- a bank of SECURITY SCREENS. Guests move around the party.

MORGAN
What am I watching for exactly?

SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
Anyone you’ve seen before. Or
anyone who looks suspicious.

But Morgan can’t help but glance longingly at the unitard-
clad Cirque de Soleil performers as they frolic past the
curtains to a STAGE set up in the ATRIUM.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, LOCOMOTIVE ROOM - SAME

A vast room of German TRAIN CARS from various eras. Sebastian
and Audrey hold hands as they move through the crowd.

AUDREY
What constitutes suspicious?

SEBASTIAN
Use your instincts.

AUDREY
I have great instincts. If I’m
attracted to them, they’re probably
gonna get us killed.

SEBASTIAN
(deadpan)
So, that guy might kill us?

Sebastian points to a cheesy BRAZILIAN DIPLOMAT with a
ponytail, in a white tux.

AUDREY
Actually, my high school boyfriend
Craig looked like that.

(MORE )
98.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Interests included: Family Guy and
finger-banging. Usually at the same

time.

SEBASTIAN
My girlfriend at Uni kinda looked
like her.

He points to a TINY VIETNAMESE WOMAN.

AUDREY
I had that phase in college too.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, BACKSTAGE - INTERCUT
Morgan’s eyes widen, seeing someone head towards the stage.

MORGAN
Hey. I see someone very suspicious.

SEBASTIAN
Okay. Stay calm. Describe him.

REVEAL the man Morgan was talking about as she describes him.

MORGAN
He has a long twirly mustache. Big
pointy scary eyebrows. He’s
holding... yeah, he’s holding a bag
with a big dollar sign on it.

Sebastian and Audrey glance at the stage. The MUSTACHE MAN is
clearly the bad guy in the Cirque de Soleil show.

SEBASTIAN
I think that guy’s part of the show.

AUDREY
Yeah, I don’t know that an actual
bad guy would look like an evil Mr.
Monopoly.

MORGAN
I’m gonna go with my gut on this.

Morgan joins the acrobats heading for the stage. She keeps
her eyes on Mustache Man as she climbs THE TRAPEZE.

The man is miming and twirling his mustache.

As Morgan gets to the top... he opens his DOLLAR SIGN BAG and
CONFETTI pours out on to the crowd.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Wait. You know what? I think you
might be right.
99.

AUDREY notices a COUPLE across the room. She grabs Sebastian.

AUDREY
Oh my God.

SEBASTIAN
What?

AUDREY

Tom and Marsha. Or whatever the
fuck their names are. Drew’s fake
parents. They’re the assassins.

Sure enough, “Tom and “Marsha” -- also dressed FORMALLY,
blending in -- stand at the bar. Glam outfits. Finally
looking like the chameleonic agents they really are.

"Marsha” spots them. She taps “Tom.” The couples stare at
each other for an intense moment across the room... Just as a
group of people passes between them.

When the sea opens up again, “Tom” and “Marsha” are gone.

SEBASTIAN
Morgan, get down. I’ve been blown.

Morgan LAUGHS.

SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
This isn’t funny.

MORGAN
Oh God, I know. I know.
(beat)
But you just said “I’ve been

blown.”
She laughs again. Sebastian shakes his head.

SEBASTIAN
Okay, both of you. Stay together and
in plain sight until I get back.
(then, to Audrey)
You put the drive somewhere safe?

AUDREY
Yes. Very safe.

SEBASTIAN
Is it in... the same place as last
time?

AUDREY

You’1l have to find out.

She flinches. That came out way too forward. Audrey stammers.
100.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

I mean, not “you'll see” as in... I
just meant I’11 tell you later...
Whatever, just go!

As Sebastian hurries off, also blushing a little.
INT. TRAPEZE - SAME

Morgan turns to descend the ladder when she sees someone
across the way, on the opposite acrobat landing.

NADEDJA. Face bandaged but wearing a unitard like it was made
for her. Morgan mutters to herself:

MORGAN
Oh my God. That girl.

A MALE ACROBAT behind her pipes up, also staring at Nadedja.

MALE ACROBAT
I know. Butterface, right?

Nadedja sees them. Morgan grabs the trapeze. It’s going down.
INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sebastian hurries to the edge of the ballroom -- a big DOOR
into a BACK HALLWAY... manned by a SECURITY GUARD. Sebastian
thinks fast -- pretends not to see the guard as he pulls a
pack of CIGARETTES from his jacket, tries to hurry past.

SECURITY GUARD
Rauchen verboten! No smoking! Sir!

But Sebastian’s on the other side of him now. He plays DUMB,
steps back. The guard follows. Now they’re behind the door.

SEBASTIAN
Sorry. Filthy habit, I know.
(conspiratorially)
Want one?

SECURITY GUARD
Sir, I don’t smoke.

SEBASTIAN
Me neither. Me neither.

Sebastian TOUCHES THE UNLIT CIGARETTE to the guard’s neck.
BZZZZZT. It’s a TASER. The guard attempts to GRAB SEBASTIAN
as he falls... knocking out Sebastian’s EAR PIECE.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Shit.
101.
He scans the floor but can’t find it in the shadowy darkness.
Fuck it. He has to move. Sebastian hurries down the hallway.
INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, LOCOMOTIVE ROOM - NIGHT

Back in the crowded ballroom. Audrey stands alone in the
CROWD. PATEL’S PHONE VIBRATES in her hand. A new text:

“In position. Where are you?”
AUDREY
Sebastian? They just texted me...
Sebastian?
Silence. Audrey starts to get nervous.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, AVIATION ROOM - SAME

Sebastian enters a dark room full of imposing GERMAN PLANES.
He looks around. No one in sight.

THUNK! A PROPELLER comes out of nowhere and KNOCKS HIM from
behind. Sebastian collapses, passed out.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - SAME
Audrey stares at the phone. Still no response. Tries again.

AUDREY
Sebastian, what’s going on?
Audrey inhales. She’s gonna have to do this herself. She
subtly reaches into her bag and pulls out her TUBE OF
LIPSTICK. Takes the cap off... twists it.

PATEL’S THUMB SPIRALS UP. Audrey shudders a little as she
uses it unlock the phone. Sends a text.

She texts: “I don’t see you”

She gets another text: “Ships Room”

Audrey takes a deep breath. As she crosses to the EXIT, she
STUMBLES over the FALLEN GUARD. Beside him, Sebastian’s
“CIGARETTES.” Audrey picks them up, hurries down the hall.
PRE-LAP loud CHEERING...

INT. ATRIUM, TRAPEZE - SAME

THE CROWD GOES WILD as “Butterface” guy does an impressive
back-flip. On the landing... CLOSE ON MORGAN. She’s next.

Morgan’s entire life has been building to this moment. Morgan
jumps from the landing, SWINGING a HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR!
102.

NADEDJA does the same, swinging from the other side. CRASH!
The women meet in the middle.

NADEDJA deals the first blow -- KICKING MORGAN in the
stomach. Morgan SWINGS BACK, sticks her FEET OUT, CAREENS
back into Nadedja. Knocks her back.

The crowd CHEERS, unaware this is for real. Loving it.
Despite that it’s life or death, Morgan is exhilarated too.

INT. SHIPS ROOM - NIGHT

Audrey enters a ROOM of CENTURIES-OLD SHIPS. She steps to the
middle of room. Silence. Then -- She sees a SHADOW moving.
Audrey freezes. The figure keeps moving toward her. And
finally emerges into the light...

IT’S DREW. HOLY SHIT. IT’S FUCKING DREW!

AUDREY
What the fuck?

DREW
Oh my God! Audrey!

He seems overjoyed to see her. Audrey’s mind is blown.

AUDREY
So wait, you’re not... ?

DREW
Dead? Yeah. That was a surprise to
me too, after what happened.

AUDREY
But I_saw you get shot. You were
bleeding. You were dead. I thought.
You weren’t dead?

DREW
I was right on the edge. But the
bullets missed my vital organs. I
woke up in a military hospital.

AUDREY
But on the news... Morgan and I are
like, wanted for your murder.

DREW
You're not. That’s how the CIA’s
been trying to find you. They lie.
But they don’t want to hurt you.
They're trying to keep you alive.
That’s why I’m here. To save you.
(beat)
And stop Henshaw.
103.

AUDREY

Sebastian? He’s been helping us.
DREW

Audrey, have you heard of Highland?
AUDREY

Yeah...
DREW

That’s who Sebastian’s working for.
He’s the assassin.

AUDREY
So who’s the target?

DREW
Me. I am. He’s been using you to
get to me. And it worked.

AUDREY

(wait? what?)
That doesn’t make sense. Sebastian
knows I thought you were dead. And
I saw Patel try to kill him. And
Patel admitted he worked with
Highland. And I’ve been texting
with the assassin with Sebastian
right next to me, so how --

DREW
Hey. Can we like, stop with the
questions for a second? I’m just...
I almost died a few days ago. I
thought I would never see you
again. Can I just give you a hug?

But when he steps toward her, Audrey reflexively steps back.

DREW (CONT'D)
Audrey...

AUDREY
Sorry. I’m just on edge. People have
been trying to kill me all week. I
know that’s like, all in a day’s work
for you but I work at Trader Joe's...

DREW
You must have been so scared. Ugh,
the thought of anyone trying to
hurt you...

Audrey flinches. This triggers something for her.

AUDREY
You hurt me, Drew. A lot.
104.

DREW
I know I did. And I’m so sorry...

AUDREY
You lied to me about everything. You
let me think I was meeting your
parents and they weren’t your
parents.

DREW
They’re the people I’ve been hiding
from. When they found me in LA, I
knew my cover was blown. And it was
just easier to... make something
up... I knew if I told you the
truth, it would lead to questions I
couldn’t answer.

AUDREY
Is that why you broke up with me by
text message? Because it was too
hard to tell me the truth? You said
you loved me. Was that a lie too?

DREW
No! I did love you. I do love you.
Even more now that we can finally
be honest with each other.

This is everything Audrey was waiting for. Especially when--

DREW (CONT'D)
(playful)
Audrey Stockman, I love you as much
as I hate that fucking Crash Test
Dummies song.

Audrey smiles. Letting her guard down a little. Playing back:

AUDREY
Which Crash Test Dummies song are
you referring to, Drew? Cause there
are so many. I don’t remember any
one in particular.

DREW
Shut up.

AUDREY
No really, I’m gonna need you to
jog my memory. Cause I have all
their albums and there are just, a
lot of tracks. And bonus tracks.

DREW
I hate you. I know I just said I
love you but I also hate you.
105.

AUDREY
If you could maybe just sing a
couple bars. How does it go?

Drew shakes his head. He knows what he has to do. And then,
in a deep bass-baritone, Drew starts SERENADING AUDREY.

DREW
Once, there was this girl who...

Off Audrey -- a captive audience in spite of herself.

INT. ATRIUM, TRAPEZE - SAME

Morgan struggles to hang on to the TRAPEZE with one hand as--
NADEDJA swings across... SLAMS both her feet into the arm
that’s holding on. Morgan’s FINGERS slip... but she regains
her balance, tightens her fist. Reaches up with the other
hand, steadies herself, swings back towards waiting Nadedja --
Morgan KICKS Nadedja at full force. It just makes Nadedja
mad. From behind her unitard, Nadedja PULLS a GUN. The crowd
keeps cheering. Assuming it’s part of the show. Until...
Nadedja FIRES --

Morgan LETS GO OF THE TRAPEZE -- sails through the air, just
missing the BULLET. It HITS an ACROBAT on the far platform.

The Acrobat falls backward, DEAD. He hits the floor, at the
crowd's feet. SLAM. The crowd is stunned. As they realize
what’s really going on--

MORGAN SAILS onto NADEDJA’S TRAPEZE... landing on top of
Nadedja -- her legs wrapped around Nadedja’s NECK.

NADEDJA TIPS backwards under the weight... just as MORGAN
manages to GRAB the TRAPEZE by the tips of her fingers.
Nadedja flails, tries to get a grip. But Morgan blocks her.

NADEDJA FALLS, FALLS, FALLS -- SLAM. She hits the FLOOR from
a hundred feet, at the crowd’s feet.

People are now fully SCREAMING. NADEDJA is finally DEAD.

Morgan SWINGS safely above, watching from her perch. Catching
her breath. Holy fucking shit.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN, SHIPS ROOM - SAME

Drew is now standing close to Audrey. Leaning against an old
ship just like they leaned against that jukebox at Barcade.
106.

DREW
...When I woke up in that hospital
and I didn’t know where you were,
or if you were even alive...

AUDREY
I know. I know. When that guy shot
you... it was so fucking horrible.

Audrey chokes back tears a little. The adrenaline she’s been
running on for days giving way to the raw emotion she’d
tamped down. She tries to fight it but Drew’s not blind.

DREW
Hey. Kiddo.

The term of endearment just makes Audrey more emotional. Drew
puts his arm around her and holds her close. Audrey
tentatively lets him. In his arms, she relaxes. She’s been
wanting this for months. They embrace for a moment. Then...

DREW (CONT'D)
Ooh, what’s this?

Drew pulls the TASER CIGARETTES sticking out of her purse.

DREW (CONT'D)
You got some spy gadgets?

AUDREY
Shut up.

DREW
What else you got here, Jane Bond?

He tosses the cigarettes aside and gently takes Audrey’s bag
off her shoulder. Starts rifling through.

DREW (CONT'D)
When’d you start wearing lipstick?

AUDREY
Uh, I wouldn’t open that.

He does anyway. Finds Patel’s THUMB.
DREW
Wow. A thousand guesses and I never
would have landed on thumb.

Audrey laughs as Drew returns to the purse. Rifles quicker
now -- less playful. Audrey gets a weird feeling.

AUDREY
Hey. The drive isn’t in there.
107.

DREW
What? No! Audrey...

He stops rummaging. Puts a hand on Audrey’s shoulder.

DREW (CONT'D)

(too fast, less genuine)
We're in this together! We just
have to get out of here. Trust me.
We can go anywhere you want. You
pick. China? You love Chinese food.
Can you imagine what they can do
with a breakfast burrito over there
with those moo shu pancakes?

AUDREY
You said not to trust anyone.

They lock eyes for a second.

DREW
Touché.

Then the DOOR OPENS. “TOM” and “MARSHA” drag in a CUFFED,
GROGGY SEBASTIAN.

AUDREY
Oh my God! Sebastian...

Audrey rushes toward him.

DREW
Audrey. He’s with them.

“MARSHA"
Oh look! We’re all together again.
Just like the Cheesecake Factory.

SEBASTIAN
Fuck, you hit me hard. I’m
hallucinating.
AUDREY
No, it’s Drew. He’s still alive.
SEBASTIAN
Audrey... get away from him. Now.
He’s gonna kill all of us.
AUDREY
Funny, he just said the same thing

about you.

We can see Audrey really doesn’t know who to trust.
108.

INT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

Morgan rushes down the hall, frantically looking for
Sebastian and Audrey.

INT. SHIPS ROOM - NIGHT
The others, as before. “Tom” turns to Drew impatiently.

“TOM”
All right, Thayer, we gave hima
full check. Drive’s not on him. Can
we remove the target now?

AUDREY
(to Drew)
Wait, you said you were the target.
You said you’re Operation Albrecht.

“Marsha” points her gun at Audrey’s head. Audrey is
TERRIFIED. Then DREW pulls out a GUN as well... Audrey
screams... But he doesn’t shoot her. He SHOOTS MARSHA. BAM.

“TOM” LUNGES for the door but Drew gets him too. BAM. “Tom”
falls back, on to an ANCIENT ANCHOR. It IMPALES HIS HEAD.
Brain matter everywhere. Audrey shakes, tries not to wretch.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Oh my god...

DREW
It’s okay, Audrey. I’m right here.
No one else matters right now.

He turns the gun on SEBASTIAN.

AUDREY
Drew, don’t!

SEBASTIAN
(calmly)
Audrey, listen to me. Drew has been
working with Patel.

DREW
Sebastian was working with Patel.

SEBASTIAN
Audrey, you saw Patel try to kill
me yesterday. He’s the one who sent
that assassin after you in Belgium.
Drew was gonna let that happen. He
would have let you die.

DREW
Sebastian sent the assassin to
Belgium.
109.

SEBASTIAN
Okay. Everything I say you did, you
can’t just say I did.

DREW
I can do whatever I want! I’m the
one with the gun.

He turns to Audrey. Meanwhile, Audrey notices MORGAN slip

into the room. No one else sees her... Morgan spots DREW.

SHOCKING. But she stops herself from making any noise. The
girls share a meaningful look.

Morgan tiptoes into the SHIP beside Drew.

DREW (CONT'D)
That night we met... changed my
life. I was driving by that bar and
I saw you. Walking. And I was like,
wherever that girl’s going, that’s
where I want to be.

AUDREY
So that’s why you went into
Barcade? Because you saw me?

DREW
I would have followed you anywhere.
There was just something magnetic.
I know this is cheesy but it felt
like Kismet. It felt like fate.

AUDREY
Really? Cause I thought we were
being totally honest with each
other. You went to Barcade to
assassinate the bartender.

And suddenly, Audrey puts it all together.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
Wait. Hunter Pierce, from those
emails. That was Ryan Phillippe’s
character in that terrible “Marked
Target” movie you made me watch.
And “Albrecht”. That’s Theo
Albrecht. Founder of Trader Joe’s.
You came here to assassinate... me.

SIRENS approach outside. Drew SNAPS.
DREW
Oh my God, I forgot how fucking
annoying you are. Fuck this shit.

Drew SHOOTS SEBASTIAN, who falls backwards. Audrey tries to
move to him but Drew is now pointing the gun at her.
110.
DREW (CONT'D)
Where’s the fucking drive?
AUDREY
I'll tell you, okay? But there’s
one thing you need to know first.
Morgan likes to set things on fire.

DREW
What are you talking about?

AUDREY
Morgan likes to set things on fire.

INT. SHIP - SAME

Morgan crouches behind a SMALL SHIP’S CANNON, aiming it at
Drew. She uses the CIGARETTE TASER he tossed aside to LIGHT
THE FUSE. Amazingly, it WORKS.

BAM!

INT. SHIPS ROOM - SAME

A CANNONBALL sails from the ANCIENT CANNON across the room...
NOWHERE NEAR DREW. It arcs through the air -- CRASHES through
the glass window. SMASH! It lands on a parked car outside. A
CAR ALARM sounds. Bystanders yell -- what the fuck?

Drew turns to Audrey, his charming smile now condescending.

DREW
Nice shot. Great plan, Audrey.

He aims his gun at Audrey’s head.
INT. SHIP - SAME

Panicking, she picks up a SOFTBALL-SIZED CANNONBALL -- heavy
as hell. But she flings it with every bit of her strength.

INT. SHIPS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The CANNONBALL CONKS Drew on the head. HARD. He weaves. He
falls. He drops his gun --

Audrey scrambles for the gun. As does Drew. As she gets
closer he reaches for her leg. She FALLS. Drew pulls her as

Audrey reaches and stretches for the gun. She kicks -- gets
him a few times in the face -- but Drew holds on.
She... GRABS it just as -- Drew gets up and LEAPS on top of

her. They struggle -- Audrey points her gun at Drew but
doesn’t shoot as Drew pulls the gun from her by the barrel.
111.

Then BAM. She SHOOTS. There’s a big bloody GAPING HOLE in his
hand. She stands and aims at the now fallen Drew.

DREW
Bitch! You blew my fucking hand off!

Morgan runs to Audrey from the ship as Drew continues wailing.

MORGAN
Jesus, how are you still alive?

DREW
Fuck you. I never liked you.

MORGAN
Feeling’s mutual, dick.

AUDREY
(to Drew)
She tried to tell me you were full
of shit. Should’ve listened.

SIREN LIGHTS flash from right outside. The COPS are coming.
Sounds of COMMOTION as POLICE descend on the building. Audrey
stays still and strong, gun steady, trained on Drew.

DREW
You're running out of time. Kill
me. That’s what I would do.

AUDREY
I’m sure it is. But I’m a better
person than you. You revealed your
true self. This is mine.

The GERMAN POLICE burst in! Audrey calmly puts the gun down
and nods to them. Take him. As the Polizei circle Drew, they
try to cuff him but can only manage his non-destroyed hand.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
To quote a text message I got once:
“Hey there -- it’s over. Sorry.”

Another OFFICER HELPS SEBASTIAN TO HIS FEET. He’s okay -- he
was wearing a BULLET PROOF VEST. Audrey rushes up.

AUDREY (CONT'D)
What?! I didn’t know you had bullet-
proof vests!

 

SEBASTIAN
I just had the one.
112.

AUDREY
You know, I would’ve felt a little
more comfortable if I also had a
bullet-proof vest. So much for you
protecting me.

SEBASTIAN
You protected yourself.

Audrey smiles. He’s right, on a number of levels.
EXT. DEUTSCHES TECHNIKMUSEUM BERLIN - NIGHT

Chaos. The place is SURROUNDED by POLICE CARS. The POLIZEI
haul Drew into one just as Sebastian and Audrey step outside.

SECURITY GUARD
Ambassador? Ma’am? Do you need an
ambulance?

AUDREY
(demure, Canadian)
Oh no. We're fine, thanks. We just
have to leave... emergency back
home... our hockey team is sick.

Morgan runs out after them. As she passes the guard:

MORGAN
Cirque de Soleil is also from
Canada. So I know them.

EXT. LANDWEHR CANAL - NIGHT

Our heroes walk down the gorgeous riverside BIKE PATH, away
from the FUCKING CHAOS behind them.

MORGAN
Sebastian... can I see your phone?

He hands it over. Morgan dials as they walk.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

Mom! Get Dad! Yeah, I know, I’m
calling from this international
spy’s phone... Sebastian Henshaw.

SEBASTIAN
Can you not reveal my identity?

AUDREY
She tells them everything. She’s
not allowed to lie.

MORGAN
Now I don’t have to.
(beat)
(MORE )
113.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Guess what, guys?! I just went to a
museum.

BEEP. Call waiting.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Ugh. Hang on a second.

INT. CIA PARIS STATION, WENDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - INTERCUT
Wendy sits at her desk, on the phone.

WENDY
Nice job, Henshaw. We found the
correspondence between Thayer,
Patel and Highland... I’m sorry I
questioned your loyalty.

Behind her, Wendy’s ADORABLE SON (6) hands her a cute drawing.

WENDY (CONT’D)

What’s this supposed to be? A dog? A

cat? It looks like a piece of shit.
(then, into phone)

Destroy that drive. Then come in.

MORGAN
I'll give him the message. I’m just
kinda on the other line right now.

Morgan hangs up on Wendy. Wendy stares at the phone. That was
a first. Morgan Sebastian.

MORGAN (CONT'D)

CIA lady said destroy the drive.
(then, to her parents)

Okay, and what did the Doctor say

about your cholesterol?

On Sebastian and Audrey --

SEBASTIAN
So Drew didn’t get the drive.
AUDREY
You said put it somewhere safe.
(then)

Morgan, give me the thing.

Morgan, still on the phone, fishes the drive from her
CLEAVAGE. Hands it to Audrey.

Then Morgan notices a MAN coming her way, carrying flowers.

EDWARD SNOWDEN.
114,

MORGAN
The fuck... I’11 call you back.
(hanging up)
Eddie... how’d you know I was here?

EDWARD SNOWDEN
I know everything that has happened
and everything that’s going to
happen.
(then, flirty)
Want to know what’s gonna happen
right now?

MORGAN
Uh, sure.

Edward Snowden produces two THEATER TICKETS from his pocket.

EDWARD SNOWDEN
You’re coming with me to see Guys
and Dolls at the Admiralspalast.
Then a bottle of ice-cold Riesling.
And then maybe we can repeat what
happened last time after we saw
Guys and Dolls together at camp.

MORGAN
...Or another idea is we can just
go see Guys and Dolls as friends.

EDWARD SNOWDEN
Should've known that was gonna
happen.

BACK ON AUDREY and SEBASTIAN. Staring at the drive.

SEBASTIAN
You can do the honors.

Audrey smiles. Then SNAPS THE DRIVE IN HALF. She hurls the
pieces OFF THE BRIDGE.

AUDREY
Can’t they just make another one?

SEBASTIAN
It’s their software. They can make
these whenever they want. That’s
where the world is headed anyway.
Total transparency. Everyone wants
to know everything.

AUDREY
(shrugging)
I still think it’s better to give
people the chance to show you who
they are. On their own terms.
115.

SEBASTIAN
Safe to say you’ve done that.

A sweet, intimate silence...

Then Audrey and Sebastian finally KISS. We leave them in
peace, pulling out to the Berlin night...

SIX MONTHS LATER
INT. SILVER LAKE TRADER JOE’S - DAY

Audrey's back at the register, still with her BLOND HAIR. And
there’s another big difference: she looks HAPPY to be here as
she rings up a customer. The next customer steps up... TESS.

TESS
Oh my God, Audrey! Your blond hair
is so fun!
(then, pitying)
I didn’t know you still worked
here.

AUDREY
Hey Tess! Yeah, you know, I
realized this job is actually
perfect for me. It’s easy, it’s not
too stressful, I can save my energy
for my real passions. And you can’t
beat the flexibility.

Tess is taken aback. Audrey’s CELL BUZZES with a TEXT.

AUDREY (CONT'D)

Speaking of which, they need me in
the supply room! God I love when I
have to get supplies.

INT. TRADER JOE'S SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

Audrey works quickly -- stealthily removes a CINDER BLOCK
from the wall -- pulls out a FAKE PASSPORT, FOREIGN MONEY,
etc. As skilled as Drew was at this.

EXT. TRADER JOE’S PARKING LOT - DAY

Audrey moves fast toward the corner of the lot where the SAME
BLACK VAN she was interrogated in is parked. This time,
Audrey confidently slides the door open and dives in without
hesitation. The van glides away.
116.

EXT. SHIBUYA, TOKYO - LATE NIGHT

The unmistakable neon hub of Tokyo’s popular nightlife area.
As we move to a side street, push into a dark BASEMENT CLUB--

TOKYO, JAPAN
INT. SHIBUYA KARAOKE CLUB - NIGHT
Dimly lit except for garish flashing neon lights. We follow--

AUDREY -- now in a stunning GOLD COCKTAIL DRESS -- as she
confidently winds through a packed, intoxicated crowd.
Approaches an expressionless CLERK at a HOST STAND.

CLERK
(Japanese)
Reservation?

Audrey's about to give her name when the sound of GLASS
SHATTERING cuts the air. The clerk -- and everyone else --
turns, distracted by the DRUNK COUPLE who just knocked over a
huge stack of glasses...

It’s MORGAN. With a Japanese BUSINESSMAN. Making a huge
scene. Seemingly oblivious to Audrey.

MORGAN

(to the Businessman)
Oh my God Akira you’re a mess!

(to the bartenders)
Barkeep! Two more Yakuzas please!
Or wait, whatever this whiskey is
called. Yakuza is the thing you’re
in, right? Oh wait, shit, was that
a secret?

Unattended now, Audrey subtly REACHES BEHIND THE HOST STAND
and presses a button. A DOOR behind the stand clicks.
Unlocked. Audrey heads for it, when--

MAN (0.S.)
Miss? Excuse me! Miss!

This stops Audrey dead. She slowly turns...

It’s SEBASTIAN. At the bar behind her. Holding out a GOLD
PURSE that matches Audrey’s dress.

AUDREY
Oh! Silly me. Must have dropped
that.

They share a private, knowing, look, then she keeps moving.
117.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

...Audrey removes a GUN from the purse as she strides down
the hall, solo. Drops the purse in the trash as she arrives --

At the end of the hall. Another door. Inside, muffled voices
conspire, up to no good. Audrey takes a deep breath.

As she cocks the gun and kicks the door open, we --

SMASH TO BLACK.

THE END
