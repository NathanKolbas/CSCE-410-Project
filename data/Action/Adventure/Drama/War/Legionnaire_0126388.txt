CHAPTER 1: PROLOGUE
-------------------

FADE IN:

INT. "LE POIVROT" - MARSEILLES - 1925 - NIGHT

LOUD, THUMPING ORCHESTRA MUSIC. A LINE of CAN-CAN GIRLS furiously KICK... TWIRL... and FLASH THIGHS across a COLORFUL SPOTLIT STAGE accompanied by a SMALL ORCHESTRA.

The Dancers' seductive winks... Pouting lips... CLINCHED SHAKING BREASTS... and FANNY-BOWS, entice AUDIENCE CLAPS, WHISTLES, HOOTS and CHEERS.

An UPSCALE, EXCLUSIVE, NIGHT CLUB packed with STYLISH, CHIC PATRONS. Everyone CLAPS... STOMP FEET or MOVES with the MUSIC... A WAITER rushes through the crowded room with a TRAY of DRINKS. He crosses a COUPLE sitting at a table.

The couple rise from the table, strolling through the room past...

RENE GALGANI -- a late twenties-something, Corsican, hot-head, dressed in formal attire -- watches the performance. He impatiently glances down at a POCKET WATCH. Rene slips the watch into his waistcoat, scanning the room.

Rene veers from the stage, strutting to the bar. Aware of his quick temper, WAITERS and REGULAR CUSTOMERS avoid Rene's approach.

MAXIM -- an enduring, huggable, French man dressed in CRUMPLED CLOTHING -- stands at the bar having a drink. 

Rene approaches from the rear, tapping MAXIM on the shoulder. Maxim nervously faces Rene.

                      MAXIM

                      (jittery)

          Rene... Would you like a drink?

Rene strong-arms Maxim away from the bar.

                      RENE

          No. Let's chat.

Rene escorts Maxim down a small stairway.

                      RENE

                      (angry)

          You said midnight!

                      MAXIM

                      (jittery)

          Don't worry, he'll be here.

INT. "LE POIVROT" - CLOAK ROOM AREA - CONTINUOUS

A HAT CHECK GIRL gapes at Rene's and Maxim's confrontation as they cross her HUTCHED-DOOR.

Rene slams Maxim up against the wall.

                      RENE

          My brother doesn't like to be kept 
          waiting. It's disrespectful!

                      MAXIM

                      (breaking into a sweat)

          I promise you... Just ten minutes.

Rene tosses Maxim aside.

                      RENE

          It's all you get!

MAXIM'S POV: Rene returns to the Main Room.

Maxim plops down on a chair, adjusting his clothing. He retrieves a HANDKERCHIEF, nervously wiping sweat from his brow.

INT. "LE POIVROT" ENTRY WAY - SAME TIME

TWO OVERLY GARNISHED LOOSE WOMEN, PAULETTE and YVONNE enter through the CLUB'S FRONT DOOR, followed by... 

ALAIN LEFERVE -- a cocky, flamboyant, handsome, young man, TASTEFULLY dressed in EXPENSIVE EVENING ATTIRE -- enters behind the two women. He slips his arms around Paulette and Yvonne, drawing them closer. 

Alain seductively whispers into Paulette's ear. She gives out a coquettish laugh, coyly rubbing against Alain as they sashay through an ELABORATE CURTAINED ENTRY WAY into...

INT. "LE POIVROT" - CLOAK ROOM AREA - CONTINUOUS

Maxim rushes to Alain, shifting his glare between the women.

                      MAXIM

                      (referring to the women)

          What the hell do you think you're 
          doing?

                      ALAIN

                      (cocky)

          Meeting you.

Alain leads the women over to the Hat Check Girl. Maxim trails alongside.

                      MAXIM

That was supposed to be an hour ago! Jesus, Alain! Can't you just for once help me out! Do you always have to make it so difficult.

                      ALAIN

          Oh, come on, Maxim... 

Alain gives Maxim an affectionate tap on the cheek.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          You love it... 

                      (winks & smiles )

          It keeps you young.

Alain suggestively nods towards Yvonne as he graciously helps Paulette with her CLOAK.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Hey, make yourself useful...

                      (leans toward Yvonne)

          Oh, what's your name?

                      YVONNE

          Yvonne.

                      ALAIN

                      (as if he knew all along)

          Help, Yvonne...

                      (to Maxim)

          ...with her coat.

Without missing a beat, Maxim automatically does as he is told.

                      MAXIM

          You're not getting off the hook that 
          easy. Especially after what I've been 
          through setting this up.

Maxim hands Yvonne's coat to Alain. 

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          What do you think I am? Some kind of 
          genie that rubs his lamp and 
          everything poofs into place?... Look 
          at me.

Alain ignores Maxim, giving both women's coats to the Hat Check Girl... She bewitchingly eyes Alain, giving him a come-hither gaze.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

                      (tugs on his belt)

          My clothes are loose from not eating 
          and...

Alain returns the Hat Check Girl's come-on with a magnetic smile. He reaches into his pocket, giving her a big tip.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Alain... It would have been a lot 
          easier to do this in Paris, but oh no! 
          You had to return home the conquering 
          hero.

Alain pivots from the Hat Check Girl, bending his elbows.

                      ALAIN

                      (overlapping)

          Ladies.

The two women lock arms with Alain, snuggling up to him. He cordially strolls to stairway 

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Galgani has sunk a lot cash into this 
          deal. We've got an opportunity to make 
          some real money. Maybe even hold onto 
          it for a change.

INT. "LE POIVROT" - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

AUDIENCE HOOTS, WHISTLE and CHEERS. The Can-Can number crescendos on the stage. LEGS kick high... RUFFLED PETTICOATS flash... the GIRLS drop en masse in front of the FOOTLIGHTS.

                      MAXIM

          Please, humor me. Try to be on your 
          good behavior. I don't want to screw 
          around with these guys. They're not 
          nice people.

Maxim, alongside Alain with women, walk past tables. The CAN-CAN GIRLS rush off stage and spread out into the audience, sitting on men's laps, knocking down drinks or exhibiting their garter belts for tips as the orchestra takes over.

                      ALAIN

          Maxim, you've got to learn to relax. 
          You worry too much.

Maxim jerks Alain close to his face.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          All I'm asking is just for once in 
          your life stop thinking with your 
          other head.

                      ALAIN

          That's why we're such a great team. 
          You got the brains.

                      (pulls women closer)

          ...I got the broads.

Maxim rolls his eyes, giving up.


CHAPTER 2: ALAIN VS. UALGANI
----------------------------

"LE POIVROT" - GALGANI'S TABLE - SAME TIME

Lucien Galgani -- a smooth, dark-featured, good-looking, ruthless, business man dressed in a silk suit -- sits at his private table as if holding court. Surrounded by: his brother, Rene; personal body guard, Viktor; and prize fighter, Julot. Galgani scrutinizes his domain.

A fidgety Maxim nears the table with Alain and the two women.

                      ALAIN

                      (to Julot)

          Hey Julot, how's the glass jah?

Maxim shoots Alain a quick glare.

                      MAXIM

                      (overlapping)

          Mr. Galgani... This is Alain Lef...

                      RENE

                      (overlapping)

          Yeah, yeah we know.

                      (to Alain)

          You're late.

                      ALAIN

                      (cocky)

          Better that than never.

                      GALGANI

                      (to Maxim)

          Who's the comedian? I thought you 
          managed a fighter.

Alain holds a chair out for Paulette. Galgani shifts his eyes to Alain.

                      GALGANI

          Excuse me, Mr. Leferve But I never do 
          business in the presence of...

Galgani gives the women the once over, considering how to define them.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          ...the female gender.

Alain takes Galgani's insult as a slap-in-the-face to both himself and the women. He studies Galgani, weighing whether to confront him.

Maxim holds his breath, praying that Alain won't do something stupid... Alain, glancing at Maxim, opts to be easygoing, his usual manner of dealing with uncomfortable situations.

                      ALAIN

          Julot, what's going on here?

                      JULOT

Mr. Galgani doesn't mix business with pleasure. 

Alain nods, implying okay. He turns to the women, patting Paulette on the fanny.

                      ALAIN

          Wait at the bar. This won't take long.

The women exit. Alain drags a chair to the table, straddling it.

                      GALGANI

          Julot tells me you're someone who can 
          be trusted. Please bear with my 
          bluntness if I get straight to the 
          point.

                      ALAIN

          Okay, by me.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          The gate's been good. You're a big 
          draw. I'll give you a shot at Julot 
          for twice your normal purse.

Elated by the offer, Alain conceals his reaction.

                      ALAIN

                      (cool)

          Not bad.

                      GALGANI

          There's just one minor stipulation.

                      ALAIN

Which is?

                      GALGANI

          You take a dive in the second round.

Shocked, Alain peers at Maxim, who shrugs indicating "it's news to me." Alain flashes a look at Julot.

Alain milks the tension at the table, retrieving a PACK of CIGARETTES from his coat pocket. He stares at Galgani from under his brow, lighting a cigarette.

                      ALAIN

                      (exhales smoke)

          I don't crash the canvas...

                      (to Galgani)

          ...for anyone.

                      RENE

          You're over your head. Don't push 
          you're luck.

                      GALGANI

                      (affectionately refers to
                       Rene)

          My brother, I love him dearly, tends 
          to jump the gun...

                      (shoots Rene a glare)

          ...and sometimes goes off prematurely.

Galgani, without losing eye contact, slowly leans back in his booth keeping his temper at bay.

                      GALGANI

          I'd like to help you fully comprehend 
          the situation. You fight for me or you 
          never fight again.

Maxim jumps in, attempting to ease the tension at the table.

                      MAXIM

                      (back-peddling & sweating)

          Mr. Galgani...

Without moving a muscle, Galgani skims his eyes to Maxim.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Alain meant no disrespect. You've got 
          to understand. 

                      RENE

                      (overlapping)

          There's nothing to understand.

Maxim glimpses between Rene and Galgani, pleading his case.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Fighting is Alain's life. He would 
          never take a dive.

                      GALGANI

                      (overlapping)

          So, this will be his first.

Maxim peeks over at Alain as if looking for help. 

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

                      (back to Galgani)

          Then again... There is always a first 
          time... and the money is very 
          generous, Mr. Galgani.

Alain scrutinizes everyone at the table realizing he and Maxim are in trouble. 

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          If I could just have a moment alone 
          with Alain.

                      GALGANI

                      (to Maxim)

          The moment's over. I want your answer, 
          now!

Something in the club catches Galgani's attention. He glances at Rene. Rene looks into the club. Alain turns, facing in the same direction.

KATRINA -- gorgeous, sophisticated, appearing in a class of her own in an out-of-place environment -- with a FRENCH BOB and wearing a FASHIONABLE GOWN approaches the table.

Paralyzed, Alain fixates on Katrina as Rene slides out of the booth.

A brief moment of recognition crosses Katrina's eyes, throwing off her pace. She conceals it, darting her attention to Rene.

                      RENE

          Hey, Trina...

Katrina brushes past Rene, without breaking stride... Katrina purposely avoids Alain's stare as she arrives at the table.

                      KATRINA

                      (to Galgani)

          Lucien, you know how I hate to keep 
          people waiting.

Alain flashes his eyes downward.

Maxim side-glances from Galgani to Katrina, Alain and back to Galgani, knowing that trouble has just shown up.

                      GALGANI

          Katrina, can't you see this is 
          business.

                      KATRINA

                      (to Galgani)

          Either you come now, or I'm leaving by 
          myself.

Wanting to avoid a scene Galgani suppresses his anger, sliding down the booth... Uncomfortable and feeling a bit exposed, Katrina reaches at the nape of her neck grabbing her hair. Rene crosses to the other side of the booth in the bg.

                      ALAIN

                      (to Galgani)

          You do have a problem with the female 
          gender.

Galgani takes Alain's insult out on Katrina, firmly clutching onto her arm. 

ALAIN'S POV: Katrina winces in pain.

                      GALGANI

                      (threatening Alain)

          I think it would be a very wise 
          decision to accept my offer, Mr. 
          Leferve.

Galgani strong-arms Katrina down the hallway. Viktor follows them away.

                      RENE (O.S.)

          So, what's your answer, big shot?

Rene taunts Alain, fanning a WAD of MONEY. Alain reaches for the money.

                      ALAIN

          I'll do it.

Rene pulls the money out of Alain grasp.

                      RENE

          Half before the fight. The rest after.

Alain rises, turning to Maxim.

                      ALAIN

          Arrange it.

Maxim surprisingly gapes at Alain.

Alain exits from the table, crossing the hallway to Galgani's office. Viktor stands by the door, guarding the entrance. 

INT. "LE POIVROT" - GALGANI'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Infuriated, Galgani throws Katrina onto the couch.

                      GALGANI

          What was that all about?

Galgani raises his arm to backhand Katrina... Katrina doesn't flinch, challenging his rage.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          How could you embarrass me like that!

Galgani furiously paces the room.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          You drive me so crazy! Why do you do 
          this to me? Especially after 
          everything I've done for you. If it 
          wasn't for me you'd still be just an 
          immigrant, threading needles in that 
          filthy shop.

Galgani hits a nerve. A hurt look crosses Katrina's face.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          See, this is exactly what I'm talking 
          about. You make me do things that hurt 
          you.

Katrina moves to leave. Feeing rejected, Galgani rushes to the couch. He clutches Katrina's thighs, holding her down.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

                      (softening)

          Please Katrina, don't do this to us.

                      (pleading)

Why can't you just do as I tell you?

Galgani reaches out, stroking her hair.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

                      (sincere)

          You know I love you.

DOOR KNOCK. Galgani quickly jumps up. He straightens himself, in attempts to deny and hide the feelings he has for Katrina.

INT. "LE POIVROT" - HALL - SAME TIME

The Hat Check Girl, carrying TWO COATS over her arm, waits by GALGANI'S OFFICE DOOR. Rene struts down the hall. He pushes the Hat Check Girl aside, barging into...

INT. "LE POIVROT" - GALGANI'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Rene burst into the room, heading to Galgani. The Hat Check Girl meekly enters behind Rene.

                      RENE

                      (excited)

          Hey, hey, hey.

                      (claps hand & points)

          We've got a deal.

Katrina looks up from the couch as Galgani turns to face his brother.

                      GALGANI

          What made him change his mind?

The Hat Check Girl nervously drapes Galgani's coat over the back of a chair in the bg.

                      RENE (CONT'D)

                      (proud & cocky)

          What can I tell you. You're not the 
          only Galgani that's got the goods!

Galgani holds out his arms to Rene as the Hat Check Girl crosses the room to Katrina. 

                      GALGANI

          Now, you're learning. 

                      (gives Rene a bear hug)

          It's all in the approach.

A concerned look crosses the Hat Check Girl's face as she gives Katrina her coat. The girl drops her eyes downward.

The Hat Check Girls' hand palms a NOTE in Katrina's hand.

Galgani, in Rene's arms, stares at Katrina as the Hat Check Girl exits.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          It's a pity everyone else doesn't get 
          it as quickly as you do.

CHAPTER 3: OLD FRIENDS
----------------------

INT. BRASSERIE - dusk

A HAND reaches for a BOTTLE of WINE, pouring it into a glass.

Alain holds the bottle, gazing at its HALF-FILLED CONTENTS. He places the bottle on the table. Alain pulls out a POCKET WATCH, looking at the time.

Alain, insecure and unhinged replaces the watch.

DISSOLVE TO:

Alain pulls a CIGARETTE from a PACK on the table. He lights himself a smoke, tossing the match into an ASHTRAY filled with CIGARETTE BUTTS.

DISSOLVE TO:

Alain, sipping wine, puts the glass on the table. He reaches into his pants pocket, retrieving a GOLD CROSS and CHAIN. Vulnerable and nostalgic from the wine, Alain wistfully fingers the cross.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BRASSERIE ENTRANCE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Katrina, wearing a FUR COLLARED COAT and BROAD RIMMED HAT, enters through the door. She hesitates, gathering strength.

The rotund CAFE OWNER, behind the bar, breaks into a smile recognizing Katrina. He quickly thumbs through ALBUM COVERS, searching for a particular record.

The cafe owner proudly holds the record up, showing Katrina. She shoots the owner a hard glance, stopping him from playing the record, as she walks through the room toward...

INT. BRASSERIE - ALAIN'S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Alain, tucked away at a far-end table, sits staring at the cross in his hand... APPROACHING HIGH HEELS.

Alain peers upward. An arrogant smile breaks across his face. He quickly stuffs the cross into his pants pocket, rising from the table. Alain holds out an empty chair for Katrina.

                      ALAIN

                      (self-assured)

          You came. I knew it.

Katrina flashes Alain a cold glare as she sits down.

                      KATRINA

          Really?

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

                      (cocky)

          Is that the way to welcome an old 
          friend?

                      KATRINA

                      (frigid)

          Friends? Is that what we were?

Realizing that getting back into her graces may not be as easy as he thought, Alain sits down. He takes hold of Katrina's hand attempting a different tack.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

                      (pleads with bedroom eyes)

          Please, Katrina. Let me explain.

Katrina, captured by his gaze, looks down at his hand in hers... Thinking he's got her, Alain goes for it.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)
                      
          I didn't realize how special you were, 
          until it was too late.

Katrina slowly inches her hand and body away, keeping her eyes to the table... Alain knows he's losing her. He makes a hard pitch.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Katrina, look at me. I've changed. I'm 
          different, now.

                      KATRINA

          Alain...

                      (exasperated)

          ...what do you want?

Alain gives her an alluring gaze, pulling out his last card.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Did you forget about our dream...

                      (touching her arm)

          ...of going to America?

Katrina throws her hands up next to her face, glaring downward.

                      KATRINA

                      (pained)

          Don't! That dream is dead... All day 
          I've sat in my room with your note, 
          considering whether or not to see you.

Katrina holds back her emotions.

                      KATRINA (CONT'D)

          This is not easy for me, Alain.

Conflicted, Katrina evaluates if she should go on.

                      KATRINA (CONT'D)

          I'm in trouble... I've got to get away 
          from Lucien. If I don't, I know he'll 
          hurt me.

Katrina's tearful eyes drifts to meet Alain.

Alain for the first time acknowledges how his actions have effected Katrina.

                      ALAIN

          How did you meet him?

INT. OLD SPANISH THEATRE - NIGHT

A BOXING RING in the center of the room. LOW-LIFE FIGHT FANS encompass the ring on WOODEN CHAIRS... THE UPPER CLASS and WEALTHY sit in the balcony boxes... GENDARMES guard the exits.

Alain -- wearing KNEE-LENGTH BOXER SHORTS and a ROBE draped over his shoulders -- enters from a DRESSING ROOM DOOR, walking through the audience to the ring with a TRAINER carrying a BAG and TOWELS. LOW RUMBLE of CROWD NOISES.

Determined, Alain keeps his eyes focused on the ring.

                      KATRINA (V.0.)

          He came into the shop to buy a dress 
          for one of his women.

Alain enters the boxing ring.

                      KATRINA (V.O.)(CONT'D)

          It wasn't exactly a good time for 
          me... I was lonely.

ALAIN'S POV: MOS. The room DISTORTS into SLOW-MOTION, mutating to a BIZARRE DREAM-LIKE situation.

                      KATRINA (V.0.)(CONT'D)

          When you didn't show up that day, 
          everything around me began to fall 
          apart.

ALAIN'S POV: MOS. QUICK CUTS of INDIVIDUALS in crowd, building to weird and hallucinatory CLOSE-UPS.

                      KATRINA (V.O.)(CONT'D)

          Lucien eased the pain... At first 
          everything was fine, but then it 
          started. My hair, make-up, the way I 
          dressed, spoke how I walked...

MOS. Alain, in the center of the ring for his introduction, surrounded by a roomful of STRANGERS.

                      KATRINA (V.O.)(CONT'D)

          ...until one day, I woke up and I was 
          someone else.

INT. OLD SPANISH THEATRE - GALGANI'S PRIVATE BOX

Galgani, sitting next to an empty seat surrounded by COUPLES, Viktor and thugs, glances at Rene entering the box. Rene takes a seat behind Galgani. 

Galgani addresses Rene from over his shoulder.

                      GALGANI

          Where's Katrina?

                      RENE

          You know how she's hates the fights. 
          She always comes late.

Galgani returns to his GUESTS. (AD LIB) Rene leans back in his chair.

BACK TO BOXING RING

Alain sits in his corner. Maxim climbs up behind him on the other side of the ropes. Alain peers up at Galgani in his box.

                      ALAIN

          Did you get it?

Maxim proudly pats his bulging coat pocket, smiling.

Alain cocks his head toward his robe, while he holds out his BOXING GLOVE with a SMALL GOLD CROSS and CHAIN.

                      ALAIN

                      (referring to his robe)

          Pocket.

Maxim reaches into Alain's robe pocket as he ritualistically drops the chain from Alain's glove into his coat pocket. Maxim retrieves an envelope from Alain's robe.

                      MAXIM

                      (referring to envelope)

          What's this?

FIGHT BELL. Alain hops to his feet.

                      ALAIN

          I'll explain later.

Concentrating on the fight, Maxim unconsciously stuffs the envelope into his coat pocket as Alain goes to the center.

(FIGHT TO BE CHOREOGRAPHED)

Alain and Julot take up their fight stance, stalking one another. CROWD HOOTS and HOLLERS.

Alain automatically goes to take a punch... and cinches back, remembering the deal... Julot swing, landing a left in Alain. 

Alain staggers backwards, leaving himself open. Julot pummels Alain. He lands several blows to Alain's stomach, forcing him into the ropes.

Alain grabs onto Julot, stalling for time. The Ref breaks them up. 

Julot dances across the ring, connecting jabs with Alain.

Alain moves around the ring, giving Julot every opportunity to hit him.

CROWD SHOTS of disappointed fans. HISSES and BOOS.

Alain and Julot, face to face, grab onto one another.

                      JULOT

          Last time we fought chump, I was paid 
          to take a dive.

FIGHT BELL. Taken-back by Julot's comment, Alain returns to his corner.

ALAIN'S CORNER

MAXIM CROUCHES NEXT TO ALAIN IN HIS CORNER. MAXIM FLAPS A TOWEL IN FRONT OF ALAIN' FACE AS THE TRAINER SPONGES OFF ALAIN.

                      MAXIM

          Okay, this is it. This is the round. 
          All you've got to do is make it look 
          good, okay?

Alain, introspective, ignores Maxim, concentrating on Julot.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Alain. Alain!

Maxim slaps Alain's face, attempting to get his attention.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Are you with me? Stay focused. It's 
          easy, just hit the canvas. You got it?

                      ALAIN

          I got it. I got it! 

                      MAXIM

          Good.

                      FIGHT BELL.

          Maxim pats Alain on the back as he 
          enters the ring.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Think about the money.

                      BOXING RING

          The two fighters move to the center of 
          the ring. Alain and Julot resume the 
          bout.

Alain holds a firm stance, pursuing Julot. Julot skips around the ring taking jabs at Alain. 

Alain remains focused and unaffected by Julot's punches.

Julot's jabs increases Alain's inner strength.

                      JULOT (O.S.)(CONT'D)

          Any last words...

Julot lunges at Alain, swinging with his entire body. Alain side-steps, avoiding Julot's fist. 

                      ALAIN

          Yeah... 

Alain whacks Julot in the face with all his might. CROWD CHEERS.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          I changed my mind.

Alain hammers Julot with a vengeance.

REACTION SHOTS of the crowd coming alive.

Shocked, Maxim screams at Alain from their corner.

                      MAXIM

          doing?

SLOW-MO. MOS. ALAIN'S HEARTBEAT. HEAVY BREATHING. MUTATED CROWD NOISE. Julot, with a BLOODY, SWOLLEN FACE, swaggers to and fro from Alain's blows. A RIGHT... A LEFT... ANOTHER RIGHT. BLOOD SHOOTS into air.

The Referee finishes his count over Julot. He reaches for Alain's arm, raising it into the air. The place goes wild. Fight fans rush to Alain as he heads for the ropes.

Angry wealthy patrons glare or shout at Galgani. Enraged, Galgani ignores them, storming through his box CURTAIN.

Alain jumps from the ring in the crowd, making his way for the exit. He bites his BOXING GLOVE LACES,attempting to untie them. 

Maxim climbs down after him, pushing his way through the fans to Alain.

                      MAXIM

          I knew it! I knew it...

Alain throws his glove against Maxim's stomach.

                      ALAIN

          Knife. Knife!

                      MAXIM

          Okay!

Maxim reaches into his pants, pulling out a pocket knife. Maxim nervously opens the pocket knife.

                      MAXIM

          You never intended to take the dive.

Maxim jogs alongside Alain, cutting his boxing glove laces.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          Jesus, Alain! You have any idea of 
          what you've done. We're dead.

                      ALAIN

          Don't worry. Everything's arranged.

Maxim gives Alain an apprehensive glare...

                      MAXIM

                      (sarcastic)

          That's makes me feel real secure.

Maxim glances over his shoulder into the crowd.

MAXIM'S POV: Rene, Viktor and thugs push their way through the crowd toward Alain and Maxim. TWO GENDARMES trail behind them.

Alain grabs an OVERCOAT from an unsuspecting fan's chair, heading for the exit.

                      (to fan)

          Thanks.

Maxim trails behind Alain, glancing over his shoulder.

          We're leaving tonight for America.

                      MAXIM

          America?! We'll never get out of here 
          alive.

Maxim quizzically gapes at Alain.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          The tickets are in the envelope.

A thought sends panic across Maxim's face.

                      MAXIM

          It's Katrina, isn't it?

Agitated, Maxim shakes his head in disbelief.

                      MAXIM (CONT'D)

          You're insane! She's Galgani's girl. 

                      ALAIN

          She was my girl!

Rene, Viktor and SIX THUGS exit the theatre.

                      MAXIM

          Great, a month of vomiting over the 
          railing.

                      ALAIN

          Stop complaining. We're finally going

          Give me the cross.

                      GENDARME #1 (CONT'D)

          What's the hurry, champ?

Alain's eyes widening.

INT. GALGANI'S ROLLS ROYCE - TRAVELING

Galgani, in the back seat, leans forward.

GALGANI'S POV: Rene, in shock, grabs onto his stomach wound. He gapes at BLOOD oozing between his fingers and plummets to the ground.

EXT. BACK TO STREET INTERSECTION

Alain drops the Gendarme sprinting away. APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Alain glances over his shoulder.

Galgani, glares at Alain, crossing the intersection as he darts down the street to his brother. 

Rene squirms on the ground in a fetal position. Galgani kneels down, taking Rene in his arms. Galgani's thugs enter from both direction in the bg.

Rene grabs onto Galgani's coat. Galgani draws Rene closer, cradling his brother.
                      
                      RENE

          I'm scared... Cold.

Tears well in Galgani's eyes.

                      GALGANI

                      (whisper)

          I'll take care of you.

Rene faintly smiles. He takes his last breath, dying in his brother's arms. Galgani viscously eyes his men.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

                      (referring to Alain)

          Kill him!

EXT. TRAIN STATION - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Katrina frantically searches the platform as passengers exit from a train. 

A man, built like Alain, walks toward Katrina through the train's brake steam. Thinking it's Alain, she runs to him.

A panicked look crosses Katrina's face upon realizing that the man is not Alain. She stops, backing away from the man. 

Katrina turns, finding herself blocked by another one of Galgani's THUGS... The man, VIKTOR, takes hold of Katrina's arm leading her away.

STREET - NIGHT

Alain hurriedly races down the enclosed area. He passes a REAR CAFE ENTRANCE, surrounded with BARRELS and covered with TARPS.

APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. Alain looks over his shoulder, crashing into a BARREL. GENDARMES' WHISTLES in bg. MENS' SHOUTS in fg. Trapped, Alain scans between the REAR and front street entrances.

Gendarmes sprint down the street, blowing whistles.

                      GENDARME #3

          Some boxer named Lefevre killed a 
          Gendarme.

Galgani's Thugs dart across the FRONT ENTRANCE.

                      VOICE (O.S.)

          Up here! I saw him go 'round the 
          corner.

The Gendarmes dash around the street corner, following the thugs.

Suddenly, a TARP flies off with Alain emerging from between TWO BARRELS. He rushes off in an opposite direction of the Gendarmes.

EXT. GALGANI'S ROLLS ROYCE - LATER THAT NIGHT

A THUG escorts Katrina to Galgani's Rolls Royce. He opens the rear door for Katrina.

KATRINA'S POV: Galgani, in the back seat, covered in blood. 

Katrina hesitates before entering.

                      KATRINA

                      (under her breath)

          Alain.

The thug pushes her through the open door.

INT. GALGANI'S ROLLS ROYCE - CONTINUOUS

Numb, Galgani sits in the middle of the back seat, oblivious to his surroundings. Simultaneously, as Katrina enters, Viktor address Galgani through the opposite back seat window.

                      VIKTOR

          She was at the station.

The thug on the other side slams the door behind Katrina as she sits down. Viktor exits in the bg.

                      GALGANI

                      (looking straight ahead)

          You'll never see him again.

Galgani faces Katrina.

                      GALGANI (CONT'D)

          ...if you try running away once more, 
          you're dead.




CHAPTER 5: JOINING THE LEGION
-----------------------------

EXT. LEGION DEPOT - NIGHT

Alain rounds a corner, sprinting into a courtyard. GENDARME WHISTLES in bg. Spotting a lit office, he darts inside shutting the door behind him.

INT. RECRUITING OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

ALAIN, OUT OF BREATH AND FLUSTERED, LEANS AGAINST THE DOOR SCANNING THE ROOM. 

ALAIN'S POV: A CLAUSTROPHOBIC ROOM WITH A DESK AT THE FAR END. COLORFUL POSTERS OF EXOTIC ADVENTURES IN THE "LEGION ETRANGERE" HANG ON THE WALLS. GENDARME WHISTLES & SHOUTS IN BG.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT (O.S)

                      (referring to the
                       whistles)

          Have you ever considered what happens 
          to the poor bastards they chase 
          through the streets?

Alain frantically looks for the source of the voice.

An elderly RECRUITING SERGEANT -- with SCARS on his face and combat RIBBONS on his chest -- enters from a back room, smoking a cigarette. 

The Recruiting Sergeant takes a few pensive puffs, inspecting a harried Alain. He sits down at his desk, gesturing with a hand MINUS THREE FINGERS.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

          Please, sit.

Alain cautiously takes a seat, trying not to stare. The crusty old vet picks up on Alain's thoughts.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

                      (shows off hand)

          Tonkin. 1894.

                      (points to facial scar)

          Soissons. 1918.

The Sergeant ceremoniously rises. Restricted by a WOODEN LEG, he hobbles to a file cabinet.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

                      (over the shoulder)

          Morocco. 1922.

Alain suddenly feels the walls closing in around him. He glances at the door. Gendarme shouts and MORE WHISTLES.

The Sergeant returns to his seat, placing an ENLISTMENT FORM on the desk.

                       RECRUITING SERGEANT 
                       (cont'd)

                       (sanctimonious)

          How can I help you, M'sieur?

                      ALAIN

          I... want to join the Legion.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

          But of course.

                      (lights another cigarette)

          Might I ask, why you would make so 
          foolish a decision?

Alain rifles his mind for an answer.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT        
                     (cont'd)

          It's about... 

                      (a smug wink)

          ...the woman?

Alain's eyes widen.

                      ALAIN

                      (nervous & covering)

          Woman?

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

                      (waves Alain off)

          Whatever the answer, there's usually a 
          woman involved.

He pushes the FORM across the desk for Alain to peruse. Alain picks up a pin, quickly filling out the form.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT

          Understand that once you sign... 

The Sergeant twists the form to read Alain's name.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT 
                      (CONT'D)

          M'seuir Duchamp...

The Recruiting Sergeant returns the form to Alain.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT 
                      (CONT'D)

          ...there is no backing out. There are 
          only three ways you return to La Belle 
          France. One, fulfill your contract. 
          Two, disability...

CLOSE ON: RECRUITING SERGEANT. He slightly cocks his head, raising an eyebrow.

                      RECRUITING SERGEANT 
                      (CONT'D)

          ...And three, in a box!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PORT - RABAT, MOROCCO - DAY

An exotic North African city with colorful rooftops and soaring MINARETS. wailing VOICE of an Islamic Muezzin...

CAMERA CRANES DOWN across several time-worn, ancient Moroccan structures to a SMALL GROUP of MISFITS marching behind a Foreign Legion CAPORAL-CHEF away from the DOCKS.

                      A BRITISH VOICE (V.O.)

          "From little towns in a far land we came,

          To save our honour and a world aflame..."

Alain, unshaven and dressed in his filthy clothes, fits-in with the overall appearance of the group. He peers over his shoulder at... 

MACKINTOSH -- a misplaced aristocratic Englishman, wearing a tailored tweed jacket and carrying a BOOK of POETRY -- who methodically strolls, musing about his surroundings.

                      MACKINTOSH (V.O.)(CONT'D)

          "By little towns in a far land we sleep

          And trust that world we won for you to keep!"

Caporal-Chef LEGROS, leads the group toward the city.

EXT. MEDINA - RABAT, MOROCCO - DAY

The recruits move through the narrow bustling streets.

ALAIN'S POV: capturing the exotic sights, sounds and smells... ARABIC WOMEN with VEIL shrouded faces... STREET PERFORMERS surrounded by curious TOURISTS... CAMEL & DONKEYS cart goods. PEDDLERS (Arabs, Jews, Blacks & Berbers) loudly hawk wares from TINY SHOPS... FRENCH COLONIALS in WHITE SUITS... BEGGARS hold out EMPTY PALMS... SHEPHERDS lead GOATS to market.

EXT. LEGION GARRISON - DAY

A huge forboding STONE COMPLEX, surrounded by a fifteen-foot wall. Outside its MAIN GATE an open market of make-shift stands house Moroccan barkers selling wares. Their CAMELS and DONKEYS rest in the bg. amongst a flurry of activity.

Legros leads the ragged file of recruits toward the MAIN GATE to the Garrison. LEGIONNAIRE SENTRIES stand by the gate's WOODEN DOORS, watching the group climb up a steep hill.

As the last recruit passes through the gate, the sentries slam the doors shut sealing them off from the world.



CHAPTER 6: NEW FRIEND
---------------------

EXT. COURTYARD - LEGION GARRISON - CONTINUIOUS

Alain and his group walk into an open-air courtyard. Enclosed within the walls, MORE RECRUITS -- dressed in civilian clothes and dredged from the gutters of Europe -- mill about like prisoners in a recreation yard. 

Some of the other recruits call out to Alain's group, hoping to find someone from their home country. They shout out queries in different languages. (AD LIB)

EXT. COURTYARD WALL - LEGION GARRISON - SAME TIME

Alain finds a solitarily wall, sitting down. Leaning against it he watches the activity from afar. 

Guido Rosetti -- a wiry, nineteen-year-old, Italian with a heavy, excitable, sing-song accent -- plops down next to him.

                      GUIDO

          'ey, you gotta cigarette for Guido?

Without acknowledging him, Alain reaches into his pocket retrieving a CIGARETTE PACK. Guido takes a smoke. Alain, staying focused on the yard, stuffs the pack back into his pocket. 

                      GUIDO (CONT'D)

          Match?

Alain, keeping his eyes forward, whips out a WOODEN MATCH STICK holding his arm outstretched toward Guido. He strikes the MATCH with his thumb nail, igniting a FLAME.

Guido leans forward with the cigarette in his mouth, lighting it with the match... Without missing a beat, Alain flicks the match into the yard. 

Guido bursts out coughing, waving the air in front of him. 

Attempting to be one of the guys, Guido leans against the wall next to Alain looking into the yard. 

                      GUIDO (CONT'D)

          Look at these men. All these men who 
          left their homes so they can be 
          heroes.

ALAIN'S POV: Mackintosh stands on one leg, propping his opposite foot against a far wall, reading from his poetry book. 

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          That's why Guido left. I'm gonna be a 
          hero, too! You know why Guido's gonna
          be a hero? 

ALAIN'S POV: Legros and Caproal Metz hover over the recruits' ENLISTMENT PAPERS.

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          So I can marry my Anna. She's my 
          fiancee, but don'a tell no one. It's a 
          secret. 

ALAIN'S POV: A buffed African-American, the only black man, Luther WILLIAMS, shuffles through the courtyard. Recruits either walk away or turn their backs as Luther nears them.

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          Anna's poppa and momma, they no like
          Guido. They think I'm a bum. But, I'll           show 'em.

Alain, unresponsive, is in the same position. Guido, talking to himself, slowly shakes his determined head.

                      GUIDO (CONT'D)

          When Guido come home, they'll see. 
          Guido will be a hero! Worthy of their 
          Anna!...

                      (excited)

          'ey, you wanna see a picture of my 
          Anna?

Guido proudly whips out a WORN photograph... Alain shifts his gaze to the photo.

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          Ah, bella! Isn't she beautiful. I'm 
          the luckiest man in the world...

CLOSE ON: photograph of an innocent, doe-eyed, Italian girl.

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          ...to have such a angel.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION - PARIS - FLASHBACK - DUSK

THREE YEARS EARLIER. A crowded platform filled with hustling passengers. Within a GROUP of RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS, Katrina -- a determined, beautiful young, country girl with long hair -- struggles with armfuls of luggage.

                      GUIDO (V.O.)

          'ey, you have a angel, like my Anna?

Alain, standing on a train step, smiles to himself watching her cross his path. He steps down, hurriedly walking up behind her. 

                      ALAIN

          May I help you?

Katrina gives him an annoyed glare, picking up her pace. She stumbles, dropping a bag. Katrina quickly uplifts it, ignoring Alain's effort to help. She loses her balance, tumbling all her luggage to the ground.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Is it me or are you just stubborn?

From under her brow, Katrina looks up at Alain... and breaks into a big bashful smile. 

                      KATRINA

          I've always had to look after myself.

                      TRAIN WHISTLE.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - LEGION GARRISON - DAY

PIERCING SHRILL of Legros WHISTLE. 

STEINKAMPF'S POV: Metz, Legros and CORPORALS with BATONS shout out orders in DIFFERENT LANGUAGES to the recruits in the courtyard.

                      CORPORALS

          Line up pigs! Into formation! Bite! 
          Mach scalene!

EXT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - LEGION GARRISON - SAME TIME

A concealed figure, SERGEANT-CHEF STEINKAMPF, watches from behind BARRED WINDOWS as Metz, Legros and Corporals push the recruits toward the center of the courtyard.

                      CORPORALS

          Allez!... Raus... Vite!

EXT. COURTYARD WALL - LEGION GARRISON - SAME TIME

Alain gets up from the wall, shaking Guido's shadow.

EXT. COURTYARD - LEGION GARRISON - CONTINUIOUS

Alain ambles toward the formation, standing next to a group of Germans in line.

ROLF BRUNER -- a stocky Aryan with close-cropped blondish hair -- at the far-end of the German group, notices Luther to his right. He moves to another position. The remaining Germans follow suit, leaving a gap between Alain and Luther.

Legros pushes Luther toward Alain.

                      LEGROS

          Tighten it up!

                      LUTHER

                      (mumbles to himself)

          I thought I'd done left that crap back 
          in the States.

Legros whacks Luther across the face with his BATON, drawing blood from the startled black man.

                      LEGROS

          Where do you think you are, neger? A 
          ladies social club?

                      LUTHER

          No, sir.

                      LEGROS

          Then, shut your mouth! You only speak 
          when spoken to. Understand.

Luther nods... Legros stomps off.

                      lUTHER

                      (under his breath)

          Yes sir, massa. I'z understands alls 
          too well.

Alain darts his eyes to Luther's bloody nose.

                      LEGROS

          Company garde a vous!

Mackintosh snaps to attention as the remaining recruits make meager, even comical, attempts to follow orders.

EXT. OFFICER'S QUARTERS - LEGION GARRISON - DAY

Sergeant-CHEF Steinkampf -- a lean, staunch, German man with a heavy clipped accent -- ambles down the lower steps of the buiding's stairway.

                      STEINKAMPF

          A Riff tribesman can gallop a horse at 
          full speed and simultaneously 
          decapitate a man's head impaling it to 
          the tip of his sword like an olive on 
          a toothpick.

Stenikampf steps off the stairway and into the...

ext. courtyard - legion garrison - continuious

Steinkampf strolls toward Legros and the recruits. 

                      STEINKAMPF

          They exist purely for the honor of 
          dying in battle. For them death brings 
          them closer to Allah and the promise 
          of unlimited virgins in paradise. With 
          such dreams they have wiped out over 
          fifteen thousand troops.

Steinkampf pivots, facing the recuits.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          When you die I promise you six feet of 
          earth and a few friendly worms chewing 
          your testicals. But I guarantee I will 
          make you men. For the first time in 
          your miserable stinking lives you will 
          know the meaning of that word.

Steinkampf struts down the line assessing the group. Legros trails behind him.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          Abd-el Krim, their leader, highly 
          cunning, very cleaver, has unified the 
          Berber tribes into a fighting force 
          the like of which you have never seen. 
          Right now, you spinelss scum are not 
          even a match for the women of these 
          barbarians.

Steinkampf and Legros stop at Guido.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          So, you're going to kill some 
          camel-humpers, eh boy?

Gudio proudly pushes his chest forward.

                      GUIDO

          Yes, sir. Hundreds.
                      
                      STEINKAMPF

          If you kill one. it will be a miracle.

                      (in Guido's face)

          They say God made man in his image. 
          I'd say he was drunk the day he made 
          you.

Steinkampf stops in front of Mackintosh, amused and taken aback by his fancy threads.

                      STEINKAMPF

          By now you're probably thinking you 
          got on the wrong train?

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (spit & polish)

          No, sir. Sergeant-Chef.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (mildly impressed)

          And what, may I ask, brought your 
          lordship to this cesspool of humanity?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Sergeant-Chef, I believe it is the 
          Legionnaire's prerogative to withhold 
          those particulars.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Don't spit your english prerogative at 
          me. When a Riff barbarian cuts off 
          your manhood, wave your rule book and 
          ask him if its his preogrative.

Steinkampf turns and addresses the entire group.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          Your only prerogative is to listen, 
          obey and learn. I am here to break you 
          and re-shape you. Not just your 
          muscles, but your souls. You will 
          change into Legionnaires or you will 
          surely die.

Steinkampf stops directly in front of Alain.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          Do you fully comprehend the meaning of 
          those words?

Steinkampf and Alain lock eyes with one another. Alain doesn't respond, holding his glare.

                      SERGEANT STEINKAMPF

          No, I don't believe you do. There is a 
          fog over your eyes and all you can see 
          is your own arrogance. One day they 
          will clear and you wil love La Legion 
          with one body, one heart and one soul.




CHAPTER 7: LIFE IN THE LEGION
-----------------------------

EXT. COURTYARD - LEGION GARRISON - LATER

The recruits are spilt into two's. The Corporals push half of the recruits to their knees. They hand HAIR CLIPPERS to the second half, ordering them to pair-up with the kneeling men. (AD LIB)

Everyone avoids the kneeling Luther. Metz grabs Alain, coupling him up with Luther.

                      CORPORAL METZ

          Cut this neger's bush!

Bruner and his Austrian partner, Glock, along with the other Germans, nudge one another snickering over Metz's treatment of Luther. 

Alain stands behind Luther, cutting his hair.

                      LUTHER

          Boy was I a dumb-ass fool, thinking I 
          could get away from it.

Alain glances at the Corporals gathered in a corner, laughing and bullshitting among themselves.

                      ALAIN

          You're not the only one. We're all 
          negers here.

                      (holds his hand out)

          Duchamp, Alain.

Suspicious, Luther looks over his shoulder at Alain.

                      LUTHER

          Oh really. Why, I've never done met 
          me a white nigger.

Alain raises his eyebrows. Luther grabs onto Alain's hand, shaking it.

                      LUTHER

          Luther... Luther Williams.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHOWER ROOM - LEGION GARRISON - LATER

Legros, Metz and CORPORALS bark orders for the men to strip. If a recruit doesn't move fast enough, his clothes are ripped off of him or he's pummeled with a baton.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHOWER ROOM - LEGION GARRISON - LATER

Alain, wearing his GOLD CHAIN with a CROSS, and Luther wait in line with butt-naked, shivering recruits. Alain takes his turn, stepping forward into a powerful jet stream of a FIREHOSE.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. REFECTOIRE - LEGION GARRISON - NIGHT

Alain and Luther, attired in ill-fitting dungarees stand in a chow line with recruits similarly dressed, holding wooden BOWLS and tin CUPS.

Luther carefully rubs his finger over his nicked and closely cropped, tender head.

                      LUTHER

          Shit man, I've felt more fuss on a 
          sweet Georgia peach.

                      ALAIN

          Never said I was a barber.

A MESS CORPORAL ladles watery SOUP from a CAULDRON into their bowls. Luther glares into it, eventually lifting the bowl to his nose.

                      LUTHER

                      (makes a face)

          Damn! Smells like the slop we'd give 
          to the pigs back home.

                      ALAIN

          You better get used to it.

Alain and Luther head toward the tables.

Bruner walks toward Alain and Luther. As he passes Guido, sitting alone at the end of a table, Bruner helps himself to Guido's BAGUETTE placing it on his bowl. Guido shrugs his shoulders, eating his soup. 

                      BRUNER

                      (to Guido)

          Thank you.

Luther, alongside Alain, grins at the approaching Bruner. He retrieves the BAGUETTE from Bruner as they cross one another.

                      LUTHER

                      (to Bruner)

          You're welcome.

Luther puts the Baguette down in front of Guido without breaking stride. Dumbfounded, Guido does a double-take in the bg. as Luther and Alain head for a far-end table.

                      ALAIN

                      (referring to Bruner)

          You don't want to push that assshole, 
          too far. You're not exactly his 
          favorite.

                      LUTHER

          I know what it's like to be the 
          underdog.

                      ALAIN

          Who doesn't.

They stop at the table, probing one another.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          What the hell do you know?

Alain places his tray on the table and walks off.

CUT TO:

INT. BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON - NIGHT

HARMONICA wails a Southern blues renditions of, "DOWN TO THE CROSSROADS."... A room crammed with THREE-HIGH STACKED STEEL BUNK BEDS. Some of the recruits are asleep, while others pass time playing CARDS or shooting CRAPS.

Luther squats against a wall, playing his harmonica... Guido's cornered a couple of recruits, showing them his PHOTO of Anna... Mackintosh lays on his bed, reading from his poetry book... Alain stares out a WINDOW, smoking a cigarette. 

Luther finishes his tune, looking up at Alain. He pockets his harmonica, approaching Alain from the behind.

                      LUTHER

                      (referring to cigarette)

          Got another?

Alain lights a cigarette off his, handing it to Luther.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Thanks.

Luther takes a drag off the cigarette. He looks deep inside of himself, admitting that he was an asshole.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Sorry, 'bout what happened at dinner. 
          It's just, I ain't use to bein' 
          treated human.

                      ALAIN

          It's okay.

                      LUTHER

          Although, it is the reason why I came 
          here.

Alain questioningly looks at Luther. Luther cocks his head toward the window.

                      LUTHER (O.S.)

          Africa...

Luther takes a long, steady drag from his cigarette, reliving the atrociousness he's experienced by being black. 

                      LUTHER

          You don't know what it's like for us 
          back in the states.

                      (bitter)

          Them white folks, they're crazy as a 
          betsey bug.

                      (a slight welling of 
                       tears)

          I've seen 'em wipe out an entire 
          town, women and chillun, over some 
          white gal blamin' rape on a innocent 
          black man.

                      ALAIN

          You?

Luther shakes his head, shaking off his pain as well.

                      LUTHER

          No, not that time... I was fingered 
          for committin' murder.

Luther drops his cigarette and steps on it. He shifts his tone.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Ever been accused of somethin' you 
          didn't do?

                      ALAIN

                      (under his breath)

          Yeah.

                      LUTHER

          It's a terrible feelin', especially 
          when the odds are against ya...

Luther looks out the window, through the iron bars.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          I was a dead man, no doubt about it. 
          So, I high-tailed it outta there.

Alain empathizes with Luther's story, understanding what it's like to be on the run. He joins Luther, shifting his gaze to the window.

                      LUTHER

                      (sweetly reminiscences)

          Old folks use to talk 'bout Africa.

                      (determined & hopeful)

          Sounded like a place where I could 
          get a shot at bein' a man. This hitch 
          was the quickest route.

ALAIN'S AND LUTHER'S POV: through the barred windows

                      LUTHER (O.S.)

          After five years I'll have some money 
          and headin' south, followin' my 
          dream.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DRESS SHOP - PARIS - FLASHBACK - DUSK

HANGING BELL RINGS from door opening.

Katrina, with her long hair on top of her head, stands behind a counter and looks up, smiling... She quickly shifts her attention on the customer in front of her. 

                      LUTHER (V.O.)

          Yessire, that's what keeps a man 
          livin', he's gots-ta have a dream.

Alain browses through the shop. Katrina hands the customer a package, seeing her to the door. She turns to Alain.

Alain rushes to Katrina.

                      ALAIN

          Maxim got me a fight for big money. 
          We are so close to our dream.

                      KATRINA

          America?!

Katrina leaps into his arms.

                      KATRINA

          When do we leave?

Alain twirls her through the room.

          It won't be long.

CUT TO:

INT. BACK TO BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON - NIGHT

Bruner and Glock play cards with the other Germans. Disgusted, Bruner throws his cards down, after losing. Guido crosses the room in the bg.

                      BRUNER

                      (shouts)

          Scheise!

Bruner watches the winner rake in a PILE OF DEUTSCH-MARKES, KRONEN, & RUBLES. He catches Guido's approach from over his shoulder, as the dealer passes out new cards.

                      BRUNER

          C'mon join us for a couple hands.

                      GUIDO

          No thanks.

Bruner, with an outstretched arm, stops Guido from passing.

                      BRUNER
          
          You insulting me, boy?

                      GUIDO

          Nooo! Guido, just don' know how to 
          play.

                      BRUNER

          I'm the one who's going to play. You 
          lend me the money. We split 
          fifty-fifty. Verstehen?

Guido shrugs, side-stepping out of Bruner's reach.

                      GUIDO

          I have no money...

                      BRUNER

          Don't make me look for it, boy!

Bruner rises, throwing a punch. Guido stoops, avoiding Bruner's fist. It pisses Bruner off even more. He goes after Guido with a vengeance. 

Guido's too quick for him. He ducks... dodges... and dances rings-around Bruner, who attempts to land a punch.

                      GUIDO

          Hey, what's a matta with you. Guido, 
          no wanna fight.

                      BRUNER

          Yeah, well I do.

Everyone, from their perspective positions, laugh or hoot at the skinny Italian leading the burly German around the room. Bruner doesn't like the humiliation.

                      BRUNER (CONT'D)

                      (to German buddies)

          Grab the son-of-a-bitch.

The Germans grab Guido, pinning his elbows behind his back. Bruner lays into him. The laughter ceases with Guido's beating. Recruits either look away or go about their business, avoiding involvement.

Luther steps forward, going to Guido's aid. Alain stops him.

                      ALAIN

          Allow me.

Alain moves toward Bruner.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Come on guys, he's just a kid.

Bruner scowls over his shoulder at Alain.

                      BRUNER
                    
          Who asked you! 

Alain grabs onto Bruner's hand in mid-air, preventing his next blow. 

Alain, in Bruner's face, slowly pushes his fist downward.

                      ALAIN

          Tell your bruders to let him go.

Sweat profusely pours down Bruner's face as he resists against Alain... Alain eyes dangerously gleam.

Everyone's attention returns to the center of the room. Only now, they are gathering around. Luther moves in closer. Even Mackintosh puts down his poetry book for this one.

Bruner realizes that he's no match for Alain as his hand is forced closer to his side.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          I said...

                      BRUNER

          Okay.

                      (to the Germans)

          Let him go.

Luther rushes to Guido as the Germans drop him. He helps Guido to a bed.

Alain releases his grip, heading to Luther and Guido. Bruner grins, looking back at his buddies... then suddenly sucker-punches Alain with a left jab. Alain barely recovers, dodging the next blow. He grabs Bruner around his thick neck.

THE FIGHT 

is wild and vile. Street-fighting at its apex of barbarity. The two men slam each other around the barracks, knocking into sleeping recruits, groups of on-lookers or anyone who gets in their way. Within seconds the entire space has become an animal's den of shouting, screaming men.

BACK TO BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON - SAME TIME

LEGROS AND METZ DASH INTO THE ROOM. THEY RELAX UPON SEEING THAT IT'S JUST A FIGHT BETWEEN TWO RECRUITS -- THE LEGION'S ACCEPTED MANNER OF RESOLVING DISPUTES.

RECRUITS PLACE BETS. FRANCS, POUNDS, DEUTSCH-MARKES, AND RUBLES WAVE IN THE AIR. MACKINTOSH IS IN THE THICK OF IT.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Twenty pounds, on the frog!

Legros and Metz take him up on it...

BACK TO FIGHT - LEGION GARRISON

Alain and Bruner riotously pound each other. Bruner takes a wild kick at Alain, which leaves himself open for a devastating knee to the groin. Followed by Alain's brutal elbow to the back of his skull.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Good show!

BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON

Glock slides a SHIV into his hand. He moves up behind Alain, ready to stick him... Suddenly, someone grabs Glock's wrist, twists it and... shoves a foot behind his knee, forcing Glock to the floor.

Mackintosh holds the struggling Glock down.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Let's keep it sporting, shall we, 
          Fritz?

FIGHT - LEGION GARRISON

Alain brutally pummels Bruner's face, but the big Teutonic ox fails to go down. Finally a powerful kick to the stomach, followed by an elbow to the head, sends the German senselessly crashing to the floor.

BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON

A tremendous CHEER goes up from the crowd. MONEY is quickly exchanged, paying off bets. Mackintosh hauls in the cash.

Alain staggers backward, into Luther's arms. Before he can catch his breath, Mackintosh's beaming face is in Alain's.

                      MACKINTOSH

          That was the finest rough-house I've 
          seen this side of the water!

                      (fervently shakes Alain's 
                       hand)

          Name's Mackintosh!




CHAPTER 8: TRAINING

INT. BARRACKS - LEGION GARRISON - DAWN

The recruits asleep in their bunks. "REVEILLE" in the bg... Legros, Metz and Corporals stampede into the room, BANGING the steel bunks with their BATONS.

                      CORPORALS

          Allez! Get up! Out of those racks, 
          you filthy dogs!

The recruits hustle out of beds, dressing.

EXT. MOROCCAN HIGHLANDS - DAY

Weighted down with COMBAT KITS and dressed in SWEAT DRENCHED KHAKI UNIFORMS, the recruits' platoon in training expeditiously march in double-time under a broiling sun.

Steinkampf, invigorated and appearing younger than his men, leads the column as if taking a Sunday stroll past a GROUP of uninterested LOCALS. 

                      STEINKAMPF

          Un, deux, un, deux, un, deux...

Steinkampf begins to sing "LE BOUDIN," 

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          "On nous appelle les fortes tetes, on 
          mauvaise reputatation..."

                      STEINKAMPF

          Sing! Sing from the pit of your 
          souls! You are Legionnaires.

Legros and Metz join in with Steinkampf, prodding the men to sing. 

                      LEGIONNAIRES

          "Mais on s'en fout comme d'une 
          musette..."

                      LUTHER

                      (under his breathe)

          Sing?! Shit, I can barely breathe let 
          alone sing.

Legros overhears Luther's complaint. He gives Luther a glare, gripping harder on his baton.

Luther's eyes widen as he straightens up, joining in with the song.

                      LEGIONNAIRES

          "On est fier d'etre a la Legion, a la 
          Legion..."

                      LEGROS

          Section halte!... Rompez les rangs.

Everyone drops their kits, falling to the ground from exhaustion.

Steinkampf stroll through the scattered reclining men.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Fantastic! Some of you are making a 
          reasonable impression of being men. 
          Bravo! Didn't expect it

Steinkampf stops, standing at attention.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          And now, since I am in a particular 
          good mood. We are surrounded by this 
          gorgeous vista. I am going to offer 
          you a treat.

Steinkampf sweeps his arm upwards, revealing a ROCK PILE.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          The rocks.

EXT. MOROCCAN HIGHLANDS - GULLY - LATER 

The platoon, with rock laden packs, march in double-time through the hilly terrain, crossing a GROUP of LOCALS.

Steinkampf trots alongside of the platoon, barking orders.

Guido's lithe frame can barely handle the weight of his kit. He stumbles. Alain and Mackintosh, on either side, lift Guido by the shoulders helping him along.

                      STEINKAMPF

          He fends for himself! This is the 
          Legion! You march or die!

Mackintosh and Alain quickly obey, backing away from Guido... Guido. Guido straightens himself up, falling back in line.

                      ALAIN

          This asshole never lets up.

                      MACKINTOSH
                      
          You'll be thanking him later.

          What this means, a march or die?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Precisely that!

Mackintosh glances between Alain and Guido.

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

          Loyalty is a virtue. But, in the 
          desert, nothing interferes with 
          survival. You cut your losses and 
          move on.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STAIRWAY - LEGION GARRISON - DAY

The recruits, with their combat gear, straddle their rifles over their heads while running up and down the stairs.

Legros, standing on top of the stairway landing, scrutinizes the recruits as they run up and down stairway.

                      LEGROS

          Vite!... Vite!... Viiite! You'll 
          never outrun Riffs at this pace!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LEGION TRAINING GROUND - DAY

In full combat gear, the recruits crawl on their bellies underneath a BARB-WIRE OBSTACLE COURSE. 

Metz, Legros and Corporals shoot MACHINE-GUN BULLETS over their heads forcing them to the ground. 

Steinkampf sardonically smiles as he intermittently tosses GRENADES. 

Guido freezes. Alain goes back into the course, aiding Guido. 

Steinkampf raises an eyebrow, scrutinizing Alain and Guido.

Together, Alain and Guido finish the drill.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. EMPTY HILLSIDE - DAY

HEAT WAVES shimmer above the hill's crest. The mid-day sun illuminates a blue sky. Recruits, wearing their combat kits and in a horizontal line, slowly rise above the horizon. Steinkampf, Metz, Legros and Corporals march alongside them as the platoon squats, inching over the hill.

EXT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LEGION GARRISON - DUSK

A make-shift laundry houses BARRELS filled with water, WASHBOARDS and CLOTHES LINES... HARMONICA ECHOES a JOSEPHINE BAKER renditions of "JUNGLE LOVE"... Recruits mull about half-dressed or in underwear, washing clothes, shaving, smoking and bullshitting amongst themselves.

Alain, Guido and Luther, playing his harmonica, wait around a barrel for Mackintosh to finish his wash. 

Mackintosh gathers his wet garments and SOAP BAR, relinquishing the barrel to Alain... Perplexed, Alain with an armful of DIRTY LAUNDRY, gapes into the barrel. 

                      ALAIN

          Where's the soap, Mack?

                      MACKINTOSH

          First thing "The Colonel" taught me.

                      (imitating a
                       proper Englishmen)

          Always carry a bar of soap, lad. 
          Never count on the military for 
          personal needs.

Mackintosh tosses the soap bar into the barrel.

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

          Don't expect this type of luxury from 
          the Legion. Use it sparingly.

Alain drops his clothes into the barrel. His feeble attempt at washing doesn't get the dirt out. He kneels, staring into the barrel. 

Picking up on Alain's predicament, Luther smiles and nudges Guido. Luther whistles at Mackintosh, drawing his attention to Alain. All three surround Alain at the barrel.

Luther grabs a shirt from the barrel, placing it on the washboard. He furiously scrubs it with soap.

                      LUTHER

          Mammy use to say, lather that up, 
          boy. Give it a real good whippin'.

Mackintosh pushes Luther aside, picking up another garment. He meticulously makes small circles on a stain with the soap.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (referring to soap)

          No, no, no! You're wasting it. Small 
          pressured strokes is the way to do 
          it.

Guido, kneeling by the barrel, dunks Alain's underwear in and out of the water.

                      GUIDO

                      (with a broad smile)

          It's the dunking! Anna says, you get 
          the dirt out by dunking.

All three furiously argue around Alain on how to properly wash clothes. (AD LIB)

                      ALAIN

                      (shouting)

          Stop!

Everyone shuts-up, looking at Alain.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          I got it.

A bit stunned by Alain's abruptness, they back off leaving Alain to his wash. Luther returns to his harmonica. Mackintosh picks up his clothes.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (to Guido)

          Who's Anna?

Thrilled by the prospect of talking about his favorite subject, Guido eyes widen. He helps Mackintosh with his laundry, walking alongside of him to the clothes line.

                      GUIDO

          Let me tell you, about the most 
          beautiful angel in the world.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

RIFLE SHOTS. CAMERA TRACKS a long row of TARGETS. Most of the Bullets WHIZ by, missing their marks. CAMERA STOPS on TWO TARGETS, side-by-side. TARGET #1 consistently scores bulls-eyes. TARGET #2 has numerous hits within the desired areas.

Alain and Mackintosh fire LEBEL RIFLES at the two targets. Mackintosh is a near-perfect marksman. For a first timer, Alain makes a better-than-fair showing. 

Steinkampf observe Alain and Mackintosh through binoculars. A SHRILL WHISTLE signals cease-fire. Steinkampf motions to Alain and Mackintosh.

                      STEINKAMPF

          You two, come with me. At least you 
          look the part.

EXT. MACHINE-GUN RANGE - DAY

Steinkampf leads Alain and Mackintosh through a field to several recruits firing heavy TRIPOD-MOUNTED HOTCHKISS MACHINE-GUNS. A NEWS CREW photographs the recruits.

                      STEINKAMPF

          These men are from the International 
          Press Organization.

                      (points to a shooting 
                       trench)

          Do us proud.

Alain's eyes narrow with anxiety.

                      ALAIN

          Sir, I would like to be excused 
          from...

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (in Alain's face)

          You will uphold the honor of the 
          Legion! Shoot as well as you are 
          capable of shooting, or by God you'll 
          wish you had.

Alain joins Mackintosh. He drops to one knee, leveling his rifle. Steinkampf steps back, smiling to the NEWS CREW... The news crew turn their attention to the two marksmen. STILL CAMERAS of the PHOTOGRAPHERS pop off FLASHES.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. GALGANI'S OFFICE - DAY

A NEWSPAPER PHOTO on a desktop reveals a fuzzy black and white image of ALAIN AND MACKINTOSH, firing rifles.

Galgani sits behind his desk. Julot is across from him in a chair. Viktor stands off to the side.

                      JULOT

          You're joking?

                      GALGANI

          My brother was murdered! You were the 
          one who suggested Lefevre in the 
          first place. I hold you just as 
          responsible.

                      JULOT

          But, it's insane. Who knows when that 
          photo was taken? The Legion could 
          have sent him to any of their 
          outposts by now.

Galgani slams his fist on his desk, lunging from his chair.

                      GALGANI

          I don't give a damn what it takes. I 
          want that asshole, dead!

                      (an afterthought threat)

          And just in case you need some help, 
          Viktor will be along to watch your 
          back.




CHAPTER 9: AT A BROTHEL
-----------------------

EXT. VILLAGE NEGRE - RABAT, MOROCCO - NIGHT

Two drunk LEGIONNAIRES crash through the door of a bar, battling over the affections of a local girl. A group of GENDARMES MILITARIES rush the Legionnaires, bludgeoning them unconsciousness with heavy TRUNCHEONS.

Alain, Luther, Mackintosh and Guido stroll past the fracas, paying it hardly a glance. Wolf packs of drunken LEGIONNAIRES swarm through the district, prowling for women and alcohol.

French Colonial mercenaries, colorful Algerian ZOUAVES and black Senegalese TIRAILLEURS troll the street, lined with seedy BARS, looking for similar amusements.

                      LUTHER

          Sweet Jesus! This here's crazier'n 
          Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday in 
          N'Orleans.

TWO overly made-up TEENAGE GIRLS, stand by the entrance to a bar, "Le Chat NOIR." They spot Alain, Luther, Mackintosh and Guido.

                      GIRL #1

                      (sing-song)

          Legionnaire, you come wit' me?

                      LUTHER

          Baby, anywhere or anyway you take me. 
          Just sho' me the door.

Before Alain or Mackintosh can get a word in, the two whores whisk Luther and Guido into the club.

INT. "LE CHAT NOIR" - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

A typical dark, dingy MOROCCAN COURTYARD with A NARROW STAIRWAY leading up to a SECOND FLOOR BALCONY that encompasses the entire area. Alain and Mackintosh enter,

finding a clientele of rowdy lower-echelon ZOUAVES and TIRAILLEURS SOLDIERS.

Mackintosh nudges Alain, nodding to far table.

ALAIN'S and MACKINTOSH'S POV: Bruner, Glock, and BUDDIES boisterously drink and cohort with whores at a table.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (concerned about Bruner)

          You might want to consider one of the 
          other establishments.

                      LUTHER

                      (referring to Bruner)

          Who, them?!

                      (back to getting laid)

          If y'all don't like the merchandise 
          don't buy it. This store's alright by 
          me.

Girl #2 seductively pins a very nervous Guido up against the wall, practically screwing him on the spot.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

                      (noticing Guido)

          See, Guido's knows how to have a good 
          time... Right, Guido?

Guido attempting to be polite, squirms under the whore's hold. 

                      GUIDO

                      (coming up for air)

          Eh, nooo!... Guido, no...

                      LUTHER

          What's a matter with you, boy?

Embarrassed and suddenly aware that all eyes are upon him... Guido looks away as if concealing something from them.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

                      (shit-eating grin)

          Hey, Guido you a virgin?

Guido shakes his head in denial, too proud to admit it. No one buys it.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Okay, that's it.

Luther grabs Guido and girl #1, dragging them deeper into the club.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          We're getting this boy a taste of the 
          good stuff.

                      MACKINTOSH

          "Desertion of one's comrades in the 
          face of the enemy" Punishable by 
          firing squad, if I'm not mistaken?

Alain smiles, gallantly sweeping his hand towards the club.

INT. "LE CHAT NOIR" - TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Luther and Guido, with their girls firmly entrenched upon their laps, sit at a table. Mackintosh sits down next to them. Alain, preoccupied by the stage performance, slowly inches himself into a chair.

ALAIN'S POV: A middle-aged European CHANTEUSE on the stage, sings a raspy rendition of "Parlez Moi D'Amour," by "Lucienne Boyer" 

Two more WHORES sashay over, hitting on Alain and Mackintosh, (AD LIB). Their enterance draws Alain's attention back to the table.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Not tonight, dear.

                      WHORE #1

          What's wrong, you no like girls?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Of course not, I'm British.

As Luther ends the negotiation, Girl #2, almost the same age as Guido, tries to yank Guido away.

                      GUIDO

          Eh... Guido, no think this so good 
          idea.

                      (apologetic glance to 
                        girl)
          
          You no understand. My Anna, she 
          may not like this.

Luther tosses a few bills on the table.

                      LUTHER

          Think of it as trainin' for your 
          honeymoon.

                      GUIDO

                      (puzzled)

          Like a hitting the bull'z eye?

Alain, Luther and Mackintosh glance amongst one another, simultaneously getting the sexual innuendo.

          Mackintosh pats Guido on the 
          shoulders.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Practice makes perfect, old boy.

                      GUIDO

                      (understanding the 
                       reference)

          Ehhhh... Okay, I'll do it.

Before Guido changes his mind, Girl #2 hurriedly gets up. Mackintosh grabs onto her arm.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (in perfect ARABIC)

          {None of your usual antics. If any 
          harm comes to him, You will curse the 
          day I met you. Treat him as if he 
          were your lover and there will be a 
          big tip for you.}

Girl #2 nods, leading Guido away with a gentle mien. Alain curiously gapes at Mackintosh.

          The Scots Guards. We marched into 
          Damascus with General Allenby. Freed

INT. BRASSERIE - PARIS - FLASHBACK MONTAGE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON ALAIN: lovingly gazing at Katrina from across a table.

A FLOWER GIRL crosses their table with WICKER BASKET of RED ROSES. Alain buys a single red rose from the girl. 

Alain gently runs the rose down Katrina's cheek and across her lips. Katrina tenderly kisses the rose as Alain presents his gift to her.

A HAND places the NEEDLE to a gramophone onto a rotating record, playing a scratchy rendition of "Parlez Moi D'Amour, by Lucienne Boyer"... The rotund cafe owner, behind the bar, turns to face Alain and Katrina at their table. He gives the young lovers an encouraging nod.

Alain and Katrina gratefully return his gesture with smiles, knowing he has played the song for them... Alain reaches a hand over to Katrina, leading her past empty tables onto a small dance AREA. 

They sensuously dance throughout the deserted cafe as the owner sentimentally watches from the bar.

INT. ALAIN'S APARTMENT - PARIS - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

Alain lights a bedside CANDLE. Katrina sits down on the edge of the bed, placing her rose on a PILLOW. Alain faces Katrina.

They painstakingly undress one another never breaking their gaze. Alain unfastens the clasp on Katrina's head, liberating her long hair around her shoulders. 

Alain gently lowers Katrina to the bed next to the rose. He makes love to her, relishing every moment.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BACK TO "LE CHAT NOIR" - NIGHT

As if in another world, Alain shifts his attention to the room. Everyone is transfixed upon the Chanteuse as she continues her ballad. 

Alain rises from the table, avoiding Mackintosh's eyes.

                      ALAIN

          How about a drink?

Mackintosh recognizes Alain's behavior, he's seen it before. 

                      MACKINTOSH

          Whiskey.

Alain heads towards the bar. 

Mackintosh scrutinizing Alain's movements.

MACKINTOSH'S POV: Alain at the bar waits for his drinks. He scans room, glancing back at Mackintosh and gives him a nod.

Mackintosh returns the nod, pivoting to the performance.

INT. BEDROOM - "LE CHAT NOIR" - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Guido, fully dressed, sits on the edge of a BED gazing upward.

                      GUIDO

          ...and there she is. Right in front 
          of Guido's face... 

Girl #2 lays on the bed in awe with bent elbows cradling her head in her hands, gaping into the air.

                      GUIDO

          ... An angel.

A sweet smile crosses Guido's face.
                      
                      GUIDO (CONT'D)

          Every Saturday night we sneak out to 
          be together. We spend hours walking 
          and talking. Sometimes we even hold 
          hands.

INT. "LE CHAT NOIR" STAGE - SAME TIME

The Chanteuse finishes her number. HIGH-PITCHED CATCALLS and MEN'S LAUGHTER. Far beyond caring, she moves off-stage unaffected by the taunting men.

INT. "LE CHAT NOIR" - TABLE

The room settles around Mackintosh at his empty table. He glances to the bar.

MACKINTOSH'S POV: TWO DRINKS, Alain's order, are on the bar where Alain previously waited. Alain is no where in sight.

Mackintosh shoots a glare at the front door.

EXT. REAR ALLEYWAY - BEHIND "LE CHAT NOIR" - NIGHT

A BACK DOOR slowly creaks open. Alain, dressed in a long TUNIC with a HOOD over his head, slips into the alley. 

Alain's eyes nervously skim his surroundings. He moves quickly through the dank passageway, turning a corner.

                      MACKINTOSH (O.S.)

          Stop right there, Alain.

Alain freezes. Mackintosh steps out of the SHADOWS. Alain sags with relief. Mackintosh slams him up against a wall.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Where the bloody hell do you think 
          you're going?

Alain's eyes harden. He pushes Mackintosh's hand away.

                      ALAIN

          Back to barracks.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Dressed like Ali Baba? I don't think 
          so.

                       (shoots a glare)

          "Desertion of one's comrades..."

Alain shoulders Mackintosh out of his way, stepping into the alley. Mackintosh grabs onto Alain's elbow, swinging him backwards.

Alain crashes into TRASH BARRELS, scattering garbage and CATS across the alley as he hits the ground. CAT SCREECHES and MEOWS.

Alain encompassed in rubbish ponders the situation. He gets up, moving to Mackintosh. 

                      ALAIN

                      (pleads his case)

          I'm not deserting! I'm going back to 
          make something right.

                      MACKINTOSH

          That's an interesting concept! Who 
          the hell do you think you're kidding?

Mackintosh throws a punch. Alain ducks, avoiding his fists. Alain attempts to cool Mackintosh down, justifying his reasoning. 

                      ALAIN

          Listen Mack...

Mackintosh grabs Alain, forcing him backwards up against the wall.

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

                      (overlapping)

          No, you listen. If you escape an 
          example will have to be made. Since 
          you won't be here, that leaves 
          myself, Luther... 

                      GUIDO (O.S.)

          'ey Alain,... Mack! Is that you guys 
          down there? Everything okay?

ALAIN'S AND MACKINTOSH'S POV: GUIDO peers down at them through A SMALL WINDOW on the second floor.

                      MACKINTOSH

          ... and Guido

Alain turns away from Guido, staring at Mackintosh.

          Yeah it's okay, everything's fine.

          Honor was my lot. My father, "The 
          Colonel" beat it into me from the 
          time I was a lad. 

...stopping on Alain and Mackintosh side by side in their cots, laying in the DARKNESS.

                      MACKINTOSH

          He was my hero, but I could never 
          live up to the standards he set. God 
          help the man who makes a mistake and 
          doesn't do the decent thing.

                      ALAIN

          What did you do?

                      MACKINTOSH

          I have a bit of a problem... 

                      (musing)

          It's odd. A man is glorified for 
          pillaging and murder, but ostracized 
          for dishonor. A fate I don't wish on 
          anyone.

                      ALAIN

          Is that why you left the military?

Mackintosh side-glances at Alain.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Dishonorable discharged, to be more 
          precise.

                      ALAIN

          Over a problem?

                      MACKINTOSH

          I like to gamble. Can't help myself. 
          It's the love of my life. Nothing 
          else will do. And the higher the 
          stakes the better. Of course it's 
          only a problem when I lose. Then I 
          have to do stupid things like writing 
          bad checks... They stripped me of 
          my command in front of my men. Some 
          of them I had been with for fifteen 
          years. 

                      (beat)

          That was the easy bit. Seeing the 
          disappointment in the old man's 
          eyes... Now, there's a wound that 
          doesn't heal.

                      ALAIN

          I know the feeling. Like the first 
          time I saw it... 

          ...on Katrina's face.

Alain struts through the cafe. Patrons acknowledge or shake his hand as he moves toward an upset Katrina, waiting for him at a far table.

          I was too busy being a big-shot,

          so-called career.

Katrina bolts from the table. Alain grabs her arm. They argue, ending with Katrina's slap across Alain's face. Alain watches Katrina dash through the cafe, exiting.

                      ALAIN (V.O.)

          To make it up to her, I promised her

Surrounded by Maxim, women and hanger-ons, Alain at a corner table indulges at his "Bachelor Party." Attempting to act as if he's enjoying himself, it's obvious that Alain is preoccupied.

          All night I thought about it. I 
          wasn't ready...

Alain turns the frame to face the wall, hanging the chain over the frame's corner.

          I thought I would be able to get her

                     (with sadness)

          But we were different people.

Katrina, having no one else to turn to, acquiesces sitting back down.

                      ALAIN (V.O.)

CHAPTER 10: MARCH TO THE FORT
-----------------------------

EXT. PARADE FIELD - LEGION GARRISON - DAY

The FRENCH FLAG flutters in the breeze... A LEGION BUGLER, plays "LE CAID." Steinkampf and LIEUTENANT CHARLIER -- a young, green officer -- stand at attention off to the side. 

After the Bugler's last note concludes, Lieutenant Charlier steps up to face the platoon.

                      CAPITANE CHARLIER 
                      (CONT'D)

          I am Captain Charlier, your new 
          commanding officer. We are being sent 
          to Fort Bernelle the last French 
          stronghold between us and Abd-el 
          Krim. 

CLOSE ON: FACES of the Legionnaires... Alain... Mackintosh... Guido... Luther... Bruner... Glock... etc.

                      CAPITAINE CHARLIER 
                      (CONT'D)

          This self-proclaimed Arab leader has 
          taken his forces deep into French 
          territory, destroying nine of our 
          outpost.

Lieutenant Charlier takes a moment 

                      CAPITANE CHARLIER 

          The Legionnaires defending these 
          positions were brutally slaughtered. 
          And those who did not die immediately 
          were tortured in a despicable manner.

Charlier glances over to Steinkampf.

                      CAPITAINE CHARLIER

          We leave at dawn. Sergeant-Chef.

Steinkampf's hard, pitiless glare scans the ranks.

                      STEINKAMPF

          A word of advice. I suggest you keep 
          one last bullet. 

For a brief moment, Steinkampf lets his guard down.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (earnest & sympathetic)

          Not for the enemy, but for yourself.

EXT. LEGION GARRISON - EARLY MORNING

MOROCCAN vendors set-up their stands in the open market outside the garrison. Beggars and stray dogs pick through trash. A few early customers barter for goods.

Legionnaire Sentries open the wooden doors to the garrison, standing on either side of the gate. With Lt. Charlier at the lead, the platoon marches through the gates, followed by a MULE TRAIN carrying AMMO and supplies. As the mules exits the garrison the sentries shut the wooden doors.

EXT. MOROCCAN HIGHLANDS - MORNING

Lt. Charlier, with Steinkampf by his side, leads the LEGION COMPANY through a bleak and inhospitable MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN. Legros, Metz and Corporals trot beside them. The company crosses a GROUP of LOCALS.

Mackintosh, leads the four friends from their midway point in the line. All four glisten with SWEAT, panting from exertion.

                      GUIDO

          'ey Alain. How far you think this 
          Fort is?

          I don't know, Guido.

          What'a you think, Mack?

                      LUTHER

          Probably about a mile closer than the 
          last time you asked.

EXT. HILLY TERRAIN - NOON

The Legion Company, depleted and haggard with soiled clothing from days of marching, crosses a small CAMEL CARAVAN under the blistering high noon sun.

Guido on the verge of passing out, runs his tongue across his cracked and dry lips. He reaches for his BIDON, (water bottle).

A HAND stops Guido from retrieving his Bidon.

Guido trails his eyes from the hand, revealing Mackintosh.

                      MACKINTOSH 

          We've been out three days, lad. No 
          telling how long the march will be. 
          Best to wait for the rest periods.

Guido nods, removing his hand from his Bidon.

Lt. Charlier halts the platoon for a break. The men release their kits, resting on the ground. Exhausted, they wipe the sweat from their brows, breath easy and drink water. 

Guido sits next to Alain, sipping water.

                      (reflecting)

          I gotta bad feelin' in my stomach.

                      ALAIN

          It's hunger.

          Don'a joke with me. I no think I'll 
          make it.

Alain faces Guido.

                      ALAIN

          What are you saying? Of course you'll 
          make it.

                      GUIDO

          I'm not so sure.

                      ALAIN

          Listen, the fort is not that far. 
          Just keep your mind on getting there. 
          Okay

Guido grabs onto Alain's arm.

                      GUIDO

          Alain, if I don' make it, will you 
          tell my Anna?... Promise me.

Alain glances at Guido's hand clutching his arm.

                      ALAIN

                      (overlapping)

          Okay, okay. I'll tell her.

          Good... It's a good.

EXT. ROCKY TRAIL - ATLAS MOUNTAINS - LATE AFTERNOON

Steinkampf struts alongside the exhausted company, leading them like a choir master as they sing "LE BOUDIN." 

                      STEINKAMPF (O.S.)

          Sing! Sing from your hearts! Proud to 
          be Legionnaires.

Petrified, Guido snaps alert as Steinkampf nears from his rear. Guido, wide eyed, sings at the top of his lungs warning the others of the sergeant's approach.

Steinkampf marches pass a singing Alain and Luther to alongside Mackintosh. Responding, Mackintosh quickens his pace in a soldierly manner.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (clearing his throat)

          Sir, with all due respect, are you 
          certain all this singing is 
          well-advised? We appear to be nearing 
          the heart of Riff country and...

                      STEINKAMPF

          It's good for the morale. When I want 
          your opinion, English! I will ask for 
          it.

                      (glaring at Mackintosh)

          Consider this a warning. Next time 
          you'll be punished for 
          insubordination. 

Steinkampf proceeds on.

                      MACKINTOSH

          That is if you're alive, mien 
          komandant!

EXT. GORGE - ATLAS MOUNTAINS - SAME TIME

Similar to a long khaki-colored snake, the COLUMN OF LEGIONNAIRES negotiate their way through a deep, narrow, steep-sided gorge. Their VOICES rise small and distant to the mountaintops.

A couple of mysterious figures move into view. RIFF WARRIORS -- attired in traditional JELABBA robes with brown BURNOOSES on their heads, armed with European RIFLES and long, curved BERBER KNIVES -- watch the Legion column from a CLIFF LEDGE.

EXT. OVERNIGHT CAMP - ATLAS MOUNTAINS - DUSK

SNOW MOUNTAIN PEAKS. A CHILL WIND HOWLS as the Legionnaires set camp for the night. GREATCOATS are tightly buttoned to shield their bodies from the frigid cold as they pitch simple two-man TENTS... gather STONES to build a protective WALL around their encampment... and cook over small FIRES.

CLOSE ON a BOOT being removed reveals a BLACK and BLOODY SOCK with more holes than fabric... CAMERA PULLS BACK: Guido painfully winces, peeling the sock from his mangled foot. He squeezes blood out of the sock... CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK, revealing Alain, Luther and Mackintosh in a DEBOUT, a fighting position, at the edge of the wall. 

Alain gapes at Guido's foot. 

                      ALAIN

                      (referring to Guido's 
                       foot)

          Why didn't you tell us, Guido?

Luther and Mackintosh, standing huddled over their small COOKING FIRE, both wince at the sight of Guido's foot.

                      GUIDO

          I'm a Legionnaire. Legionnaires march 
          or die.

                      LUTHER

          Don't you go buying that Legionnaire 
          crap. It don't mean nothin' out here. 
          It's about survivin' and all we got 
          is each other.

Alain reaches for Guido's foot.

                      GUIDO

                      (pulls away)

          'ey, I'm a no baby.

Mackintosh, knowing that Guido isn't going to last much longer, sympathically gazes down at Guido.
                      
                      MACKINTOSH

          Luther is right. Give him your foot, 
          lad. We won't think less of you. It 
          has nothing to do with your manhood.

                      ALAIN

          As long as we all stick together, 
          we'll make it back home.

                      (directly to Guido)

          Guido, we'll make it. Trust me.

Guido acquiesces, giving his feet to Alain. Alain wipes the blood off, wrapping the wounds.

Alain glances at Mackintosh and Luther. Their faces reveal that Guido's chances of survival is almost impossible.

Mackintosh takes a few steps away from the fire. Luther trails him. They both gaze out across the desert.

                      LUTHER

          This sure is one big empty country.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Big, it is. But I promise you, empty 
          it is not. They're out there...

          It's their country and... 

ABD-EL KRIM -- a majestic, dignified man, dressed in ROBES OF THE FINEST MIDDLE EASTERN MATERIAL -- looks up from a PARCHMENT MAP, staring into the desert as if aware of Mackintosh's gaze.

                      MACKINTOSH (V.O.)(CONT'D)

The Legionnaires continue their relentless pace. HEAVY PANTING... CLICKING OF EQUIPMENT from kits... BOOTS ON SAND.

EXT. SAHARA DESERT - LATER THAT DAY

WORN LEGIONNAIRE BOOTS over the rocky ground... A pair of BOOTS FLATERS. 

Unable to hold-on any longer, Guido's frame sags with resignation. His knees buckles, dropping his rifle and body into the sand.

Agony rules Guido's eyes. Both his body and spirit are broken.

Alain drops is rifle and rushes to Guido, kneeling beside him.

                      ALAIN

          Guido. Get up!

Guido gazes at Alain with empty eyes, shaking his head.

                      GUIDO

          I no can go on.

Alain kneels next to Guido, holding out his hand.

                      ALAIN

          Come on Guido, get up. You can do 
          it.

Legros roughly shoves Alain aside. Luther steps in to help Alain with Guido. 

                      LEGROS

                      (to Luther)

          Get back! Back in line.

Legros lifts Guido off the ground. Alain grabs onto the half-dead Guido, attempting to keep him away from Legros. 

                      LEGROS (CONT'D)

                      (to Guido)

          On your feet.

Steinkampf enters.

                      ALAIN

                      (to Steinkampf)

          Give him time to rest. He's weak. 

                      STEINKAMPF

          The man is mentally weak. Physical 
          weakness is nothing that a nights 
          sleep can't cure.

                      (to Guido)

          What he has is incurable. 

                      ALAIN

          You always tell us the Legion is a 
          family. 

                      STEINKAMPF

          Don't tell me, about the Legion. 
          Leave him!

                      ALAIN

          No, I left a friend to die once 
          before.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Your breaking my heart. Then carry 
          your friend! Give him your water, 
          your blood for all I care. But, I 
          will not sap the strength of sixty 
          men to save two...

                      (to Legros)

          ...Caporal.

Steinkampf shoots a glare at Legros, indicating for the company to move on.

                      LEGROS

                      (to Luther & Mackintosh)

          Pick up those rifles.

                      (to the company)

          Garde a vous! March.

The company falls back into line. 

                      GUIDO

          Leave me, We'll never make.

Alain hoist Guido onto his back.

                      ALAIN

          No! We will. We'll make it together.

EXT. SAND DUNES - MONTAGE - DAY

sparkling sand emanates HEAT WAVES... LEGIONNAIRES' BOOTS sink into sand... The COMPANY descends a SLOPING DUNE, surrounded by sand and more DUNES in the bg.

ANGLES ON THE LEGIONNAIRES wiping SWEAT from their brows, suffering, raising their BIDONS to their lips... finding them EMPTY.

LUTHER unscrewing the cap from his BIDON. He looks back at Alain carrying an unconscious Guido. 

ALAIN discloses stark eyes, abandoned by life. The hot SUN blazes upon his exposed face.

EXT. WADI - DAY

A DRY CREEK BED of SMALL GULLIES and BOLDERS. As the LEGION COMPANY crosses, TWO Legionnaires spot a WATER HOLE.

                      LEGIONNAIRES

          L'eau! Water! Wasser!

Delirious from the heat and thirst, a FEW MEN drop their KITS, rushing the water hole with their BIDONS in hand. Others join in, charging the hole en masse. Steinkampf and Lt. Charlier do nothing to stop the mad rush.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (to Legros)

          Post sentries.

Mackintosh survies the steep rocky banks of the creek-bed. He notices that the sentires are only covering one area.

                      MACKINTOSH

          This is a riduclous! Someone needs 
          to talk some sense into these 
          blasted idiots.

Mackintosh struts toward the Lieutenant and Steinkampf.

Mackintosh resolutely approaches his command officers. He salutes speaking in a distinctive, respectful tone.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Sergeant-Chef, we are vulnerable. 
          Might I suggest sentries on high 
          ground?

Steinkampf glares at Mackintosh. Lt. Charlier, suffering from sun-stroke, turns his attention onto Mackintosh.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Ah, our military expert.

                      LIEUTENANT CHARLIER

                      (overlapping)

          He's right, Sergeant-Chef. We're 
          naked out here.

Steinkampf salutes, grudgingly acknowledging the order. The Lieutenant turns, sauntering to the watering hole.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (to Mackintosh)

          Very well English, unpack the heavy 
          machine-gun. Take it to your high 
          ground. Oh, and by the way you and 
          your comrade will be the last to 
          take water.

Steinkampf marches off.

Shouldering their weapons, Luther grimaces at Mackintosh as they climb up to the top of the embankment...

                      LUTHER

          Thanks, Mack. Hell, I don't mind 
          drinkin' mud for the next couple 
          days.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Better mud than blood.

Depleted, Alain's trudges toward the water hole with Guido across his shoulders. He gently releases Guido from his back.




CHAPTER 12: BATTLE AT AN OASIS
------------------------------

GUNSHOTS RING OUT. Alain races for safety behind a boulder, and releases Guido.

Mackintosh looks over his shoulder. 

MACKINTOSH'S POV of a LEGIONNAIRE hit by a bullet. SLOW-MOTION of a second BULLET ripping a hole through the man's shoulder... ANOTHER BULLET blows out his chest, driving him to the ground.

RIFFS charge over the TOP OF A RIDGE, firing RIFLES and HOWLING a WAR CRY.

                      RIFFS

          Ya illah lah! Ya illah lah!

Mackintosh and Luther dive for cover, searching in vain. BULLETS WHISTLE overhead, forcing them down.

Pandemonium reigns among the surprised Legionnaires. MORE howling RIFFS, armed with SCIMITAR SWORDS pour over the ridge.

Alain grabs a rifle off of one of the dead Legionnaires. Just as he's about to leave, Guido in a semi-unconscious state, grabs onto Alain.

                      ALAIN

          You're safe here. Keep down.

                      GUIDO

          No, I want to fight.

                      ALAIN

          Just stay here, Guido.

Alain runs off to a better fighting position. 

Steinkampf, Bruner, Glock and a few others scurry for fighting positions behind boulders or in gullies.

A gunshot belts Lt. Charlier off his feet. He splashes backwards into the muddy water. A Riff finishes him with a SCIMITAR. BLOOD seeps into the water.

A SMALL GROUP OF RIFF HORSEMEN swoop through the wadi. They kill off the MULE TRAIN GUARDS, stampeding the animals through the wadi.

Mackintosh & Luther hurriedly situate the LEWIS GUN to its TRIPOD.

                      LUTHER

          What the hell's goin' on. They're 
          all over us.

                      MACKINTOSH

          If they chose to, they could wipe us 
          out. My bet is, they're after the 
          mules carrying the ammunition.

Steinkampf fires at the Riff Horsemen, attempting to halt them stealing the suppies.

Mackintosh opens fire with the lewis gun. Luther takes shots at the Riffs with his rifle.

RIFFS spasm and drop from the steady stream of MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

Luther nudges Mackintosh, pointing in a direction.

MACKINTOSH'S POV: whips to Alain, cutting down ANOTHER SCREAMING RIFF.

                      LUTHER
                      
                      (shouting)

          Alain! Over here!

Mackintosh swings the lewis, covering Alain on his way to the water hole. He empties the magazine. Luther scrambles to reload.

TWO RIFF spin around in the water hole, charging Alain with scimitars held high. 

Alain fires, blowing the FIRST RIFF back into the water hole. He squeezes his trigger, clicking an EMPTY WEAPON.

The second RIFF charges forward, swinging his scimitar. Alain ducks, belting the Riff in the groin. Alain finishes him, smashing his rifle butt down on the Riff's head.

MORE RIFFS charge Alain from the rear. They're BLOWN-AWAY by a shower OF MACHINE-GUN BULLETS.

Mackintosh rain a hailstorm of lead into Alain's attackers. 

Alain races to the CHATELLERAULT RIFLE. He balances it on a DEAD LEGIONNAIRE, firing at the Riffs.

Alain, Mackintosh and Luther single-handedly stave off the attack. INTERLOCKING FIRE, they spew a steady stream of hot lead.

The battle draws to an end, as the Riffs retreat. 

Steinkampf leaps to his feet, shooting at the retreating Riffs. 

A Riff horsemen charges at him with a raised scimitar from the rear. Suddenly, the Riff horsemen is blasted out of his saddle.

Steinkampf looks in the direction of the gunshot that saved him.

Barely standing, Guido holds a smoking rifle. A smile crosses his face, proud to have saved his commanding officer... A GUNSHOT explodes is Guido's chest, belting him into the air.

REACTION SHOTS: of Mackintosh, Luther and Alain from their various positions of Guido being hit.

EXT. WADI - AFTERMATH OF ATTACK - LATER

Steinkampf and Legros strut through the area, surveing their losses. Twenty men dead, another five wounded.

Steinkampf, trudges through the water, bumps into something. He glances down at the bobbling, bell-up BODY OF LT. CHARLIER.

Alain, surrounded by Mackintosh and Luther, crouches by Guido. Alain removes Anna's picture from Guido's pocket.

Steinkampf approaches, hovering over Alain and Guido.

                      ALAIN

                      (to Steinkampf)

          At least he died a Legionnaire.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Yes, I'm not given to sentiments. He 
          did prove himself a Legionnaire, but 
          so did nineteen other, brave, young 
          men who died for us today. Lets move 
          on.




CHAPTER 13: THE FORT IN THE DESERT
----------------------------------

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - MORNING

A LOOKOUT in the watchtower turns from his post, shouting into the fort below.

The HEAVY WOODEN GATES swing open... Steinkampf leads his exhausted and wounded platoon into the fort. Legros brings up the rear guarding Mackintosh, Luther and Alain, with their wrists tied behind their backs.

ANGLES ON: THE PLATOON MEMBERS... BRUNER... GLOCK... MACKINTOSH... LUTHER... ALAIN, all aghast, DEFEATED or CRUSHED by the fort's condition. 

A decrepit FORTRESS... ROTTED or DESTROYED HIGH CRENELLATED WALLS with MENDED LADDERS... WEAK SCAFFOLDS lead up to fighting positions along the battlements... The fort's inhabitants -- twenty additional, sickly gaunt LEGIONNAIRES with grim features -- turn away from their repair work gawking at Steinkampf's platoon as they enter the fort. 

CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT, the fort's commander, walks through the courtyard greeting Steinkampf and ragged platoon. Steinkampf offers a salute. The platoon straggles into the courtyard in the bg.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          I was expecting a full company. 
          Where's your commanding officer?

                      STEINKAMPF

          Lost during an ambush.

Captaine Rousselot raises an eyebrow, scanning the exhausted company.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Along with the ammo and supplies, so 
          it seems.

Legros pushes Mackintosh, Luther and Alain away from the platoon, heading to Steinkampf and Rousselot. 

Rousselot's attention shifts to Legros, Mackintosh, Luther and Alain. He turns to Steinkampf for an explanation.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT 
                      (CONT'D)

          Deserters?

                      STEINKAMPF

          Insubordination.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Put them on work detail, immediately.

Capitaine Rousselot struts off, leaving Steinkampf.

FORT BERNELLE - FRONT GATE - LATER

Alain, Mackintosh and Luther walk through the HEAVY WOODEN DOORS to the front of the fort.

Deep in thought, Alain touches his gold cross.

                      LUTHER

          You did all you could for Guido. You 
          gave him a second chance.

                      MACKINTOSH

          And what did Guido do with it. He 
          saved Steinkampf.

                      LUTHER

          Steinkampf.

CUT TO:

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - FORT PERIMETER - DAY

Alain, Mackintosh and Luther, drenched in sweat, work under a blazing sun constructing a barb-wire fence outside the fort's front gate. 

                      LUTHER

          Insubordination my ass. What kinda 
          crazy army is this.

                      ALAIN

          A French one.

                      LUTHER

                      (referring to Steinkampf)

          I should have shot that fool when I 
          had the chance.

                      MACKINTOSH

          With your aim?

Alain takes a swig from his water bottle and hands it to Mackintosh.

                      ALAIN

          What are you complaining about? At 
          least we've got water.

Mackintosh takes a drink, passing it onto Luther.

                      MACKINTOSH

          And without mud. Steinkampf must be 
          getting a soft spot for us.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD - DAYS LATER

A LARGE PLATOON of fresh LEGIONNAIRES march through the gates. Their SERGEANT barks orders, forming them up.

A MULE TRAIN with AMMO and supplies trails in behind the platoon.

Captaine Rousselot and Steinkampf marches through the courtyard to greet the reinforcements. Rousselot takes the opportunity to take a dig out of Steinkampf.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          How fortunate for us, at least this 
          platoon got through the Riffs.

                      STEINKAMPF

          They were probably too busy ambushing           my men to notice.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

                      (side glances Steinkampf)

          Your men, like yourself Sergeant-Chef 
          seem to breed insubordination.

                      STEINKAMPF

          How dare you. I ask you to withdrawl 
          that.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT 
                      (CONT'D)

          Not in a lifetime. Have them unload 
          the supplies.

INT. FORT BERNELLE - AMMO STOREHOUSE - SAME TIME

Legros keeps an eye on Alain, Luther and Mackintosh as they unpack ammo crates from MULES and carry them into the AMMO storehouse. The reinforcements break formation in the bg.

                      LUTHER

                      (referring to 
                       reinforcements)

          Poor fools.

                      LEGROS

          You three, unload the ammo.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (under his breath)

          What there is of it.

Alain removes a CRATE from one of the mules. His eyes go wide.

ALAIN'S POV: Viktor and JULOT mull about the courtyard with the reinforcements.

Simultaneously, Viktor sees Alain. He sadistically glares at Alain running his finger down his cheek, indicating that Alain is a dead man.




CHAPTER 14: HITMEN
------------------

INT. FORT BERNELLE - CANTEEN - DAY

Legionnaires at numerous tables, play cards, smoke cigarettes and bullshit. Everyone drinks cheap ALGERIAN PINARD.

Mackintosh sits at a table with Viktor, Julot, Bruner, Glock and Buddies playing cards.

Bruner lays down a winning hand, drawing his winnings to his side of the table.

                      BRUNER

                      (gloating)
                      
          So, you don't always win English.

A HAND clamps onto Julot's shoulder. He looks up.

Alain smiles down at him.

                      ALAIN

          Mind if I join you?

Alain hops over the table, plopping down opposite of the Viktor and Julot.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

                      (to Julot)

          Hey, it's good to see an old face. 
          Even if it is as ugly as yours.

                      VIKTOR

          Still the comedian.

Alain looks to Viktor.
                      
                      ALAIN

                      (to Viktor)

          We've been close, but never 
          introduced...

Alain extends his hand.

                      VIKTOR

          Fuck you.

Alain grabs Viktor's mug. He stands up, raising it in the air, bellowing at the top of his lungs.

                      ALAIN

          Mes amis! I'd like to introduce you to 
          Julot and Fuck you.

There's mug raising and scattered laughter amongst the crowd. 

                      JULOT

          Laugh while you can. 

Alain burst out laughing. The Germans wonder if Alain has gone crazy...

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

                      (drops back into his seat)

          You know, until today I thought I was 
          the stupidest bastard on earth, but 
          you guys...

Mackintosh scrutinizez Alain, trying to figure out what's up with him.

                      VIKTOR

          Don't you want to know what happened 
          to your litte bitch?

Alain face turns stone cold as he sits down.

                      JULOT

          You'll never know, Alain.

                      VIKTOR

          You're going die lover-boy, without 
          ever knowing.

Alain intensely glares at the Viktor and Julot.

                      ALAIN

          I want to thank you...

Viktor and Julot, curiously stare at Alain.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          ...because when I joined the Legion I 
          didn't care if I lived or died.

Alain breaks into a knowing smile. 

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          They say it's a place where a man gets 
          a second chance. Now that you've 
          showed up, I think I'll stick around.




CHAPTER 15: DAILY PATROL
------------------------

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

The BUGLER blows "LE CAID" as the FRENCH TRICOLOR is hoisted up the flagpole. The LEGION COMPANY stands on-line in morning formation with LEBEL RIFLES at their sides.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Starting today, we will be sending out 
          reconnaissance patrols on a daily 
          basis.

Reading from a CLIPBOARD:

                      STEINKAMPF

          The following Legionnaires will step 
          forward for today's patrol. Bruner... 
          D'Esparbes... Duchamp... 

Bruner, Julot and Alain step forward. The rest of the names are all part of Bruner's clique.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Ehrhardt... Glock... Junger... Klems.

Viktor steps forward with the others. Alain gets increasingly suspicious. 

Luther and Mackintosh glance to one another, worried.

Steinkampf pauses for effect, toying with them. He locks eyes with Mackintosh, then checks his clipboard again.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Mack-in-tosh.

Alain breathes a sigh of relief. Mackintosh steps forward, slapping Alain on the shoulder, joining the patrol.

                      LEGROS

          Section dismissed.

The platoon falls out, except for Luther.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (to Luther)

          You have a probem with that? Look at
          me when I talk to you.

Luther glances at Steinkampf.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          Don't spoil your record.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Legros leads the EIGHT-MAN RECON PATROL across a rocky, arid wasteland. Fort Bernelle, a couple of miles to their rear, is barely visible in the bg.

CLOSE UP ON: ALAIN... Viktor... JULOT... Clutching their RIFLES... FINGERS tense-up on triggers... SWEAT runs down their faces... BOOTS trudge over the sandy, rocky terrain. 

MACKINTOSH is behind Alain, watching his back.




CHAPTER 16: BETRAYAL OF A FRIEND
--------------------------------

EXT. RIVERBED - DESERT - DAY

The patrol snakes through the remains of a BONE-DRY RIVER. Legros, at the head of the patrol with Glock, raises his arm silently calling a halt. The Legionnaires crouch resting their weary bodies, but keep their rifles ready. 

Legros signals to the rest of the patrol that he and Glock are going to scout the edge of the riverbank. Legros and Glock quietly ascend the steep wall of the river.

Viktor makes eye contact with Julot. Alain, behind them, knows what they're thinking -- there won't be a more opportune moment than right now.

Alain's finger tenses on his trigger. He SWEATS profusely. He can hear his HEART THUMPING.

A RIFFLE MUZZLE suddenly taps the back of Alain's head.

                      MACKINTOSH (O.S.)

          Drop it.

                      ALAIN

          Mack?

Alain slowly gapes over his shoulder. Alain's eyes reflect pain and a mind-reeling confusion.

                      MACKINTOSH

          The rifle, Alain.

Dumbfounded, Alain ogles Mackintosh as Julot slides the rifle from his grasp.

                      MACKINTOSH

          I'm sorry, old boy. This, for better 
          or worse, appears to be my second 
          chance. 

Alain shifts his body, facing Mackintosh.

                      ALAIN

          Why?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Money. 

                      ALAIN

          What happened to looking after your 
          friends.

                      MACKINTOSH

          My father paid off all my debts. The 
          disgrace nearly killed him. Now, I 
          have a chance to make my peace with 
          him.

                      ALAIN

          Are you the one who gets to pull the 
          trigger?

                      MACKINTOSH

          My part is to deliver you and lead 
          them out of the desert.

Alain can't believe what he's hearing.

                      ALAIN

          You took the word of these two that 
          Galgani can be trusted?
                      
                      VIKTOR

          He has half the money, now! Galgani 
          will honor the rest.

                      ALAIN

          Honor?



CHAPTER 17: SURPRISE ATTACK
---------------------------

GUNSHOTS in bg. Alain reacts, rolling to his side. Viktor and Julot hit the sand. Mackintosh remains upright, listening to its ECHO in the distance.

Another GUNSHOT. And another. More ECHOES. Everyone nervously dart glances, attempting to find the source of the gunfire... FOOTSTEPS race over rocky soil. 

Legros and Glock BOLT DOWN THE BANK OF THE river, accompanied by more GUNSHOTS.

                      LEGROS

          Allez! On your feet! Vite! Vite!

A TRIO OF ARMED RIFFS ON HORSEBACK charge over the embankment, chasing Legros and Glock.

Mackintosh levels his rifle at a Riff horsemen. The Riff flies off his horse. Viktor, Julot, and the rest of the patrol OPEN FIRE, bombarding the Riff horsemen with a FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.

                      LEGROS (CONT'D)

          Back to the fort!

Trailing their panicked Caporal, the Legionnaires sprint through the river. Julot has ALAIN'S RIFLE slung over his shoulder.

                      ALAIN

          Julot! My rifle!

Alain outstretches his hand. Julot hesitates, unsure... An ominous RIFF WAR CRY, crescendos in bg.

More RIFF HORSEMEN crest over the bank. They charge, FIRING RIFLES at the fleeing Legionnaires.

                      MACKINTOSH

          For God's sake, man! Throw him the 
          bloody rifle!

Julot tosses Alain his RIFLE. Alain quickly shoulders it, aims, and FIRES...

A RIFF HORSEMAN is blasted out of his saddle.

The tail-end of the patrol, Mackintosh, Viktor, Julot, and Bruner follow Alain's suit. They stop, turn, aim, and FIRE... 

belting a few Riffs out of their saddles. But, MORE RIFFS pour over the top... An endless stream of howling, crazed Berbers.

                      ALAIN

          Let's get the hell out of here!

Alain and Julot glimpse at each other, realizing that they're both on the same team. They bolt for their remaining patrol members. 

Bruner takes a bullet in the leg. He stumbles and falls. RIFF HORSEMEN thunder towards him... gleaming SCIMITARS held high.

Alain and Julot notice his plight. They halt, FIRING OFF a couple rounds... A few Riffs go down.

Bruner hobbles, falling further behind. BLOOD streams down his leg. Another bullet tears a hole in his arm, knocking him off-balance. He falls face down.

Alain and Julot decide not to tempt fate, they turn, sprinting toward the rest of patrol.

Bruner raises his face, seeing the RIFF HORSEMEN converge upon him. He rests his chin on the barrel of his rifle, struggling to pull the trigger. His wounded arm makes it impossible. 

A COUPLE OF RIFFS leap off their horses with their long, curved KNIVES. Bruner attempts to pull the trigger with his one good arm... A Riff slices the German's bicep, rendering that arm useless as well.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The Legion patrol clears the riverbed. BRUNER'S UNGODLY SCREAMS.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - WATCHTOWER - SAME TIME

TELEPHOTO POV: THROUGH BINOCULARS of the remaining reconnaissance PATROL pursed by a HERD of RIFF HORSEMEN. Ehrhardt goes down.

The LOOKOUT drops his BINOCULARS, yelling into the courtyard.

                      LOOKOUT

          Riff horsemen chasing the patrol!

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD - DAY

LEGIONNAIRES sprint with RIFLES in hand, taking positions along the battlements. Noise and confusion runs amok. 

                      STEINKAMPF

          Sergeant, to the west wall. 

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Corporal, man the battlements.

                      CORPORAL-CHEF

          Yes, sir.

LUTHER dashes up a LADDER, climbing towards a machine-gun position. ECHOING GUNSHOTS in the distance.

EXT. BACK TO DESERT - DAY

The patrol tears across the bleak landscape. 

A BULLET EXPLODES through Junger's chest. He tumbles into the dirt.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS - DAY

A BASTION juts out from the line of the wall -- emplacements for the machine-guns. Luther, frustrated, adjusts the sights of a LEWIS MACHINE-GUN... SWEAT pours down his forehead. 

                      LUTHER

          C'mon... C'mon, you're almost there!

LUTHER'S POV: THROUGH THE SIGHTS can't get a bead on the PURSUING RIFFS without endangering the patrol.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Shit!

Luther drags the machine-gun to another position.

EXT. BACK TO DESERT - DAY

Alain and the patrol scurry for their lives, legs churn, arms pump.

Julot trips... falling hard on his face. The Riffs get dangerously close. They howl for blood. Scimitars held aloft.

TWO HANDS grabs JULOT by the scuff of his shirt... and pulls him to his feet. JULOT looks up... ALAIN and Mackintosh are on either side of him! SLOW-MOTION as a brief look passes between them.

Alain and Mackintosh pulls Julot along. 

ALAIN'S POV: of Fort Bernelle's OPENED GATE just a few hundred meters ahead.

A Riff Horseman gallops up directly behind ALAIN. He readies his SCIMITAR, aiming for Alain's head. Suddenly, the Riff is BLOWN into the air!

THE ENTIRE FRONT LINE OF CHARGING RIFFS is immediately decimated by MACHINE-GUN BULLETS riddling their bodies!

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS - DAY

Luther, in a new position, spews machine-gun bullets at the Riffs. Steinkampf shouts to all the Legionnaires on his side of the battlements.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Rapide Fire! Rapid Fire, Legionnaires.

THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THE FORT facing the Riff attack OPENS FIRE with a deadly barrage.

A HAILSTORM OF LEAD drop the Riffs in their tracks... They turn and retreat, leaving DEAD or DYING MEN and HORSES littered across the desert floor.

Mackintosh, Julot, Viktor, Legros and Alain dart through the GATE. The HEAVY WOODEN DOORS quickly slam behind them.

INT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Legros, and the remaining patrol members barely catch their breath. CAPITAINE Rousselot is in their faces, followed by Steinkampf.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          How many casualties?!

                      MACKINTOSH

          We lost Junger, Eharhardt and Bruner.

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Dismissed.

The patrol member break up.

Steinkampf stands outside the Officer's quarters with a Corporal as Rousselot moves toward him in the bg.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (to Corporal)

          I want an immediate report of the 
          wounded.

The Corporal exits as Rousselot approaches Steinkampf.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          What's the situation?

                      CAPITAINE ROUSSELOT

          Three dead.

Luther jogs up to Alain and Mackintosh as they leave the courtyard, heading for an archway.

                      LUTHER

          I can't always be around to save your 
          asses.

Luther picks up on the tension between Alain and Mackintosh as the two men spit-up, walking in different directions.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

                      (to Alain)

          What's wrong with Mack?

Alain avoids Luther's question, glaring at Mackintosh as he struts off.
                      
                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          What the hell's wrong with you?

Establishing shot of fort as the setting sun creeps over the sand dunes. Sentries peacefully stroll up and down the battlements

INT. FORT BERNELLE - CANTEEN - DAWN

The Legionnaires sit at tables eating breakfast... drinking coffee... or smoking cigarettes.

CLOSE-UPS: Legionnaires... Luther... Mackintosh... Alain deep in thought.

          approaching!

Everyone races from the canteen into the courtyard and their fighting positions.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS - FORT BERNELLE - MORNING

Steinkampf, Legros, Alain, and Mackintosh sprint up the steps to the battlements. 

Rousselot stays down in the courtyard directing Legionaires to their fighting positions... A MORTAR CREW set-ups next to him, preparing for the attack.

EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME

THIRTY RIFF HORSEMEN ride up a crest, halting in front of the fort. A THRILLING WAR CRY builds from their VOICES joined in unison.

                      RIFFS

          Ya illah lah!! Ya illah lah!!

Edgy Legionnaires stare into the desert.

                      LUTHER

          Who are they kidding. They don't have 
          a chance against us. Do they Mack?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Never underestimate them.

                      ALAIN

                      (referring to Mackintosh)

          Or anyone else for that manner.

          A terrified Legionnaire fires his 
          rifle into the desert. He's joined by 
          others.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Hold your fire! Wait for the order!

Steinkampf puts the BINOCULARS to his eyes, scanning the horizon. Behind the horsemen there appears to be movement by smaller groups of foot soldiers taking up positions.

Steinkampf lowers his binoculars.

The unrelenting CHANT of Berbers intensifies in volume.

EXT. FORT & DESERT - DAY

The RIFF WAR CHANT mutates to a howling ROAR as the horsemen charge with rifles pointed forward and swords held high!

MACHINE-GUNS situated along the crest-line spit bullets at the fort covering the advancing horsemen.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS

The Legionnaires on the BATTLEMENTS OPEN FIRE... A BARRAGE OF RIFF BULLETS ZING over their heads or smash into the hardened mud brick walls. They intermittently duck behind the crenels in between rifle shots.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Legionnaires, make every shot count.

Mackintosh shakes behind the POUNDING LEWIS MACHINE-GUN. Luther feeds it with an ammo belt. BULLET HITS ricochet off their crenels, pelting them with SHARP PARTICLES of DEBRIS.

Alain sticks the barrel of his RIFLE over the edge of the parapet, blasting off shots.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - PERIMETERS

THE RIFF MACHINE-GUNNERS TAKE UP CLOSER POSITIONS TO COVER THEIR MEN. A SMALL GROUP OF RIFF INFANTRY MOVE IN WITH THEM. FIRING AT THE FORT.

BULLET WOUNDS to the face pitch LEGIONNAIRES from the embrasures.

The Riffs break through the barb-wire.

                      LUTHER

          Guess we didn't do too good a job with 
          the barb wire.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

Rousselot at the breech, sees the Riffs advancing through the barb wire with ladders.

He races to the ammo storehouse, ordering Legionnaires.

          Grenades! Send up the grenades!

Legionnaires race up to the battlements with CRATES of GRENADES.

Alain steps back looking for another target. A Legionnaire goes down next to him. He quickly takes cover, firing at the advancing Riffs.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BASTION

SMOKE rises from the Lewis' OVER-WORKED BARREL from Mackintosh's bursts. A bullet RICOCHETS off the crenel. hot METAL shards strikes Mackintosh in an eye. 

Mackintosh drops to the floor with his hand press against the wound, squelching the BLOOD.

                      LUTHER

          Mack?!

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (grimacing)

          Take over, Yank...

Luther, keeping a hand on the ammo belt, grabs the pistol-grip handle of the machine-gun and... FIRES AWAY single-handedly.

Steinkampf trails the satchel bombs entering into the fort. He sees that the attack is on the front gate.

                      (to Rousselot)

          They're headed for the walls!

He continues to fire, BLASTING BULLETS.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

or

INT. FORT BERNELLE - CANTEEN/INFIRMARY

An eerie STILLNESS settles over the fort, punctuated by the CRIES AND MOANS of the wounded or dying.

Luther and Mackintosh wait in line with the wounded for the doctor... Alain, shoudering Steinkampf, enter from the bg.

                      STEINKAMPF

          How you doing, English?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Stiff upper lip, Sergeant-Chef. I'll 
          pull through.

                      STEINKAMPF

          What rank were you in your British 
          army?

                      MACKINTOSH

                     (after a short
                      hesitation)

          Captain. Of Infantry.

Alain and Luther share a surprised look.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Well, as of now, you're a Sergeant in 
          the Legion. I expect a full report on 
          the damage and how much ammo survived 
          in a twenty minutes. Have the surgeon 
          come to my quarters when he's finished 
          with the wounded.

Aware of the burden, Mackintosh hesitates... and salutes, accepting the commission.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Yes sir, Sergeant-Chef.

Steinkampf nods to Alain, indicating to move on... He stops, glancing back at Mackintosh.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Sergeant, I'm spare with compliments. 
          But, the men have done well. Could you 
          tell them?

                      MACKINTOSH

          Perhaps, they'd like to hear it from 
          you.

Steinkampf tenses, strutting off.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS - TWILIGHT

Alain takes a moment to himself, pacing the battlements. He slowly glimpses into the desert. 

ALAIN'S POV: RIFF CAMPFIRES intermittently placed along the entire horizon surrounding the fort.

INT. FORT BERNELLE - CANTEEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

A deadly silence permeates the room. Alain and Luther, at a table with other surviving Legionnaires, eat soup and drink coffee.

Taking his new rank to heart, Mackintosh moves through the room, clapping men on the backs, giving them courage.

                      LUTHER

          "Captain of Infantry," huh? Fits him 
          like a new set of threads.

Mackintosh at Viktor's and Julot's table. He places a foot on a chair, resting his elbow on his knee.

                      ALAIN

                     (looking up from soup bowl)

          It's what's inside a man that counts.

Luther is surprised by Alain's statement. Alain avoids a confrontation, returning to his meal.

                      LUTHER

          Don't be jealous, Alain. Mack deserves 
          it. 

                      (glances to Mackintosh)

          He knows what he's doin'. 

                      (back to Alain)

          I'll tell ya this, I feel a whole lot 
          better now that he's runnin' the sho'. 
          I bet'ya he's already done figured out 
          how the hell we're get outta here.

Mackintosh, with an EYE PATCH, steps up. Luther jokingly throws a salute. Alain is non-responsive.

Mackintosh smiles slightly, then hardens his expression.

                      MACKINTOSH

          We need to talk.

CUT TO:

INT. FORT BERNELLE - OFFICERS QUARTERS

MAPS and FOREIGN LEGION REGALIA on the surrounding walls. Steinkampf, with his arm in a sling, sits in the bg. surveying Mackintosh's mastery.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Without ammo we won't last another 
          day. 

                      (points to map)

          There's a open area between two of the 
          Riff's campsites.

Our only hope is to contact Fort Corbieres for reinforcements.

                      ALAIN

                      (suspicious)

          Let me guess, we're the volunteers.

                      STEINKAMPF

          Just the neg... 

                      (catches himself)

          ...Private Williams can pass for a
          native. 

Their eyes sail to Luther.

                      ALAIN

          It's suicide!

                      STEINKAMPF

          There's another Legionnaire who speaks 
          Berber. We have clothing from the Riff 
          prisioners. While it's dark the two of 
          you will infiltrate past their lines. 

                      MACKINTOSH

          It's the only chance we've got...

                      (to Luther)

          You know I'd go with you if I could.

                      ALAIN

          Don't do it, Luther.

Mackintosh flashes a glare at Alain, pulling rank. 

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (to Luther)

          I'm sorry, but there are no 
          alternatives.

EXT. FORT BERNELE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Establishing shot of the fort against a star lit sky. 

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - CANTEEN - SAME TIME

Luther, leaned against a wall, sits with Alain playing his harmonica. Dressed in a JELABBAH ROBE with his UNIFORM underneath, Luther wails a wistful rendition of "SWING LOW, SWEET CHARIOT."

Luther stops playing. It's an uncomfortable moment.

                      LUTHER

          I came here to find a life and I 
          realized I was looking in the wrong 
          place. It's not out here, it's an 
          inside job.

                      (faces Alain)

          I don't know what happened out there 
          on that patrol, but I do know some 
          kind-a- shit came down between you and 
          Mack.

                      ALAIN

          Now, is not the time.

                      LUTHER

          And it's really none of my God Damn 
          business!...

                      (easing up)

          Look, all I gots-ta say, is nothin' 
          means shit in this world 'xceptin' how 
          we feel 'bout ourselves and each 
          other.

Alain's not going for it.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          Look, we're all brothers out here, 
          whether you like it or not. Whatever 
          Mack's done, when the time comes he'll 
          be there for ya.

Luther shoots a look at Alain, indicating "GET IT!"

                      ALAIN

                      (cracks a forlorn smile)

          Watch your back.

Mackintosh approach from the bg.

                      MACKINTOSH

                      (to Luther)

          It's time to go.

Luther glances up at Mackintosh. He and Alain rise as Mackintosh exit. Luther hands Alain his harmonica.

                      LUTHER

          Hold on to this. Can't chance losin' 
          it.

Luther loads a REVOLVER and stuffs it in his clothing. He holds up a single BULLET for Alain's inspection.

                      LUTHER

                      (nervous smile)

          For my pocket.

They tightly grip each other's arms, locking eyes... and exit through the door.

FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

Mackintosh, Steinkampf and the other VOLUNTEER watch the Legionnaires pull back a wagon, exposing a small opening in the wall. Luther and Alain enter from bg. 

Luther places a BURNOOSE on his head. He nods at Mackintosh, implying he's ready.

Mackintosh shakes Luther's hand. Unable to deal with it, Mackintosh lets go, darting his eyes downward.

                      STEINKAMPF

                      (to Luther)

          Good luck.

                      LUTHER

                      (to Steinkampf)

          For y'alls infomation, Sergeant-Chef.

                      (proud)

          It's nigger! Not neger.

Luther winks at Alain and Mackintosh, slipping through the opening behind the other volunteer. 

Luther turns back to face Alain and Mackintosh. He salutes, waving off his friends as the wagon cuts off their view.

Alain grits his teeth, holding back his emotions. Mackintosh steps up beside him.

                      MACKINTOSH

          This is the part I never had the 
          stomach for. Sending them out there, 
          when you know damn well what their 
          chances are.

                      ALAIN

                      (side-glances Mackintosh)

          You could have fooled me.

Alain walks off, leaving Mackintosh with his thoughts.

CUT TO:

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - DAWN

Legionnaires scurry throughout the fort. They REPAIR the DAMAGED AREAS... SALVAGE AMMO and... RATION BULLETS.

The gray light of dawn seeps into the sky... Alain, leaned against a wall, fingers his GOLD CROSS.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ALAIN'S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

SAME NIGHT OF EARLIER LOVE SCENE. Propped against a headboard, Alain cradles Katrina in his arms underneath BED COVERS. Katrina unfastens her GOLD CHAIN and CROSS. She places it around Alain's neck, attaching its lock.

                      KATRINA

          I can't watch you in the ring. It 
          pains my heart to see you hurt. Wear 
          this to know that I'm always with you.

Katrina gently touches Alain's lips. She smiles, gazing into his eyes and leans in to kisses him.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - SAME TIME

Alain drops the cross, glancing throughout the fort.

ALAIN'S POV: Mackintosh paces along the walls, scanning the desert.

Viktor and JULOT sit off by themselves. Viktor sharpens his bayonet. Julot flicks a cigarette stub into the courtyard. He reaches into his pocket for another one, finding an empty pack. A FIGURE casts a shadow across them.

ALAIN holds out a CIGARETTE. 

Julot stares at Alain... Alain waves the cigarette, making a face that says, "Come on, take it."

Julot relents, reaching for the smoke. Alain strikes a WOODEN MATCH on the wall. He holds it for Julot to light his smoke.

                      ALAIN

          Is she alive?

                      VIKTOR

          We already told you asshole, you're 
          going to your grave without ever 
          knowing.

Alain keeps his gaze on Julot as he lights a cigarette for himself.

                      ALAIN

                      (to Julot)

          We're all gonna die here today.

Alain takes a drag off his smoke. He probes deep into Julot's eyes.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Think about it, Julot. Do you want to 
          die as a champ or a servant.

A moment of truth between the two men. Julot examines Alain, considering what he has said.

Alain exits, leaving Julot to his conflict.




CHAPTER 19: CAPTURED FRIEND
---------------------------

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS - LATER THAT MORNING

Retrospective, Alain paces the battlements... As if sensing something, he slowly looks up and into the desert.

Alain's eyes widen in disbelief.

                      ALAIN

                      (under his breath)

          Luther.

EXT. DESERT - SAME TIME

Luther, in his LEGIONNAIRE UNIFORM, walks between two SAND DUNES toward the fort. Although it appears as if he has made it, something isn't quite right.

Suddenly, Riff horsemen ride up behind him. Simultaneously, Luther is jerked to the ground.

The Riff horsemen dismount, preparing to torture Luther.

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT, taking down one of the Riffs. More Riff ride into frame from bg.

The Riffs take off, galloping across the desert dragging Luther.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS

Alain faces hardens, overcome by a terrible rage. A RIFLE SHOT goes off next to Alain. He turns to see who's shooting.

Julot, next to Alain, glances over and nods at Alain. The two men fire at Luther's attackers, as other Legionnaires join them.




CHAPTER 20: THE LAST BATTLE
---------------------------

EXT. DESERT

The Riffs halt their horses, forming a circle around Luther. 

Luther, half-dead and bloodied, slowly raises himself to his knees... 

A Riff horsemen raises his scimitar above Luther's head. A RIFLE SHOT blasts the Riff from his horse.

LUTHER'S POV: of Alain aiming his rife in his direction.

Luther, with pleading eyes, stares in Alain's direction.

                      LUTHER

          Make it quick, brother.

Alain's rifle shot is a direct hit to the heart, ending Luther's suffering.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS

Alain, holding a smoking rifle, slowly lowers it gazing into the desert... Everything goes still around him.

A powerful BOOM spews a red-orange FLASH, hurtling A shelL toward the fort... It flies above Alain's head, exploding in the courtyard behind him.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE

SEVERAL SHELLS fly over the battlements... EXPLOSIONS rock the different areas of the fort... Legionnaires scramble for shelter.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION hits the FLAGPOLE, rocketing the Fort's Flag into the courtyard.

EXT. DESERT - RIFF ARTILLERY POSITION

RIFF CANNONS BLASTS shells with a full on artillery attack on the fort. 

ABD-EL KRIM watches, through binoculars, as his artillery lay waste to the fort.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

A group of Legionnaires run for shelter. A Riff shell lands on top of them, hurling the men into the air.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS

Explosions blows holes through the walls... Legionnaires scramble for their lives... Others are flung into the air from direct hits... Or badly wounded by flying debris.

Mackintosh leaves his machine-gun position, leading Legionnaires to sheltered areas.

Glock, doubles over from being wounded. Alain hoist him over his shoulder.

                      ALAIN

          Don't worry, I'll get you to the 
          infirmary.

Alain races down the battlements, dodging explosions past Mackintosh's empty machine-gun position... Just after he crosses it, another RIFF SHELL hits the machine-gun pitching it into the courtyard.

EXT. DESERT

Abd-el Krim circles his arm in the air, motioning to his calvary.

TRILLING RIFF HORSEMEN charge across the desert toward the fort... They break-up into three groups. 

One group take SNIPER positions, covering the other two groups, as they head to FORT'S FRONT GATE and BREECH AREA.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

Alain, carrying Glock, races through an aftermath of explosions. He crosses the Legionnaire MORTAR CREW, who furiously load and shoot SHELLS over the fort's walls.

Pinned down Legionnaires huddle in sheltered areas.

Wounded or dead soldiers lay outside the over-crowdeD infirmary. Alain places Glock next to it's door, discovering that he's dead. 

Alain reaches for two rifles, sprinting back into the courtyard.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - OUTSIDE GATE AREA

Riff horsemen quickly dismount. They set-up charges by the front gate.

Riff snipers in the fg., keep their men covered as they ignite the charges.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - BATTLEMENTS

Steinkampf waves toward the front gate. Legionnaires race across battlements. Mackintosh brings up the rear.

                      STEINKAMPF

          The gates! They're going for the front 
          gates.

Legionnaires plummet into the courtyard from RIFF SNIPER BULLETS.

                      STEINKAMPF (CONT'D)

          Take positions.

Legionnaires crouch down behind walls, shooting at the Riff snipers... Mackintosh motions to a few men.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Follow me.

Squatting along the battlements, Mackintosh and men continue to move toward the front gates.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - OUTSIDE BREECH AREA

The second group of Riff Horsemen quickly mount their horses as one of their comrades dashes along the area igniting charges.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - OUTSIDE FRONT GATE

RIFF HORSEMEN scamper for cover on either side of the front gate.

KAHBOOM!... The Front gates explodes, splintering into a million pieces.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

KAHBOOM!... The breech area EXPLODES, pelting debris... sandbags... and the fort's wall into the courtyard, hurling Legionnaires, through the air.

A RIFF SHELL screams through the sky, landing into the REAR TOWER. KAHBOOM!... Bricks explode, showering the courtyard and blasting a Legionnaire into the desert.

The Mortar Crew run out of shells.

EXT. DESERT

Abd-el Krim sends runners to his cannoneers... The cannoneers cease the ARTILLERY ATTACK.

Abd-el Krim motions to various positions across the horizon.

A MASSIVE CHARGE of CRAZED, TRILLING RIFF FOOT soldiers race toward the fort from every direction... A SECOND GROUP of INFANTRY step into position behind the charging masses, waiting for their orders... MORE RIFF HORSEMEN follow the charging infantry.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

Riff infantry and horsemen charge through the front gate.

Riffs pour through the breech area. The courtyard becomes a battlefield of hand to hand combat... scimitars against BAYONETS... and gunshots from every direction. 

Legros gallantly shoots and bayonet Riff soldiers... He notices a GROUP of RIFF HORSEMEN charging into the...

INT. FORT BERNELLE - INFIRMARY

The Riff Horsemen ride through the room... jump over beds... shoot wounded... and wreck havoc.

Legros enters, firing off several rounds. He takes down all, but one of the Horsemen who rides up behind him.

Legros quickly pivots with his bayonet, knocking the Riff's scrimitar out of his hand.

With all of his might, Legros grabs onto the mounted Riff. The two wrestle amongst one another. 

The Riff kicks Legros, forcing him backwards. The Riff snaps his wrist, sailing a KNIFE through the air.

THUNK... Legros gapes down at the knife lodged into his chest. He wavers... and falls face down onto the ground.

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

Alain furiously cracks off shots at the advancing Riffs. He runs out of ammunition. Throwing away his rifle, he grabs another rifle from a dead Legionnaire and resume fighting.

Steinkampf, on the stairs, is a solidary fighting machine. Riff after Riff go down from his Rifle shots... When he runs out of bullets, he quickly grabs another rifle and keeps firing.

The Riffs keep coming, backing Steinkampf up the stairs. His rifle clicks empty... 

Alain notices Steinkampf's predicament. Alain covers Steinkampf emptying his rifle. 

It gives Steinkampf the opportunity to pull out his pistols.

A SCREAMING RIFF draws Alain attention. He ducks, side-stepping out of the way... and swings his RIFLE BUTT into the Riff.

Meanwhile, Steinkampf runs out of bullets. He glares at an advancing Riff, knowing that he's facing death.

The Riff sneers at Steinkampf as he creeps up the stairs. 

Alain finishes his Riff off with a deadly blow to the head. He glances up at Steinkampf.

ALAIN'S POV: Steinkampf proudly accepts his fate... SEVERAL GUNSHOTS rivet Steinkampf' body, tumbling him down the stairs.

Panicked Legionnaires clamber for ammunition, grabbing RIFLES from fallen COMRADES... Others resort to HAND to HAND COMBAT.

Mackintosh, on the BATTLEMENTS, throws GRENADES as MORE and MORE RIFFS pour into the courtyard.

Alain and Julot find themselves fighting next to each other. When one runs out of ammo, the other tosses either a RIFLE or PISTOL to one another.

                      JULOT

          Oh, by the way I didn't take a fall. 
          You beat me on your own.

They get backed into a corner as the NEVER-ENDING INFLOW of RIFFS continue to charge... Julot swings to his left, taking on several Riffs as Alain searches for another Rifle.

Julot bayonets a Riff... and rips the RIFF'S RIFLE from his hands as he goes down. He pivots in Alain's direction, tossing the rifle at Alain.

                      JULOT

          Alain...

Alain dives for the rife, leaving Julot open... Julot takes a BULLET meant for Alain. He gapes at Alain... and plummets to the ground.

From the ground, Alain gazes at Julot's fallen body. He notices that Julot fell next to one of the MACHINE-GUNS.

Alain rolls over the ground, ducking bullets, to the machine-gun. He quickly positions it, BLASTING BULLETS into the Riffs.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Abd-el Krim scrutinizes the attack on the fort.




CHAPTER 21: TO THE LAST MAN STANDING
------------------------------------

EXT. FORT BERNELLE - COURTYARD

An ODD SATCHEL BOMB flies over the fort's wall onto the battlements next to Mackintosh... KAHBOOM. The scaffolding collapses, covering Mackintosh in rubble.

Alain swings his machine-gun, taking out the last of the Riffs. 

Alain looks around, discovering himself amongst a pile of CORPSES... Steinkampf lays on the stairs under a pile of Riff bodies... Julot face down on the ground... and Mackintosh half-buried beneath the COLLAPSED SCAFFOLDING. 

Depleted, Alain crumbles to his knees... Viktor slips out of hiding place, walking up to him.

Alain doesn't have the energy to fight Viktor as he aims GUN to Alain's head.

Mackintosh bruised and bloodied drags himself from under the rubble. He reaches inside his pocket for his single bullet.

MACKINTOSH'S POV: Alain nods to Viktor, succumbing to his fate... MACKINTOSH'S SHAKING HAND loads his LAST BULLET into a REVOLVER.

Alain slowly looks up.

                      ALAIN

          Viktor, just tell me. Katrina, is she 
          okay?

Viktor cocks the TRIGGER, aiming the pistol at Alain's head.

                      VIKTOR

                      (with a sardonic smile)

          You'll never know. 

BLAM! A BULLET slams into Viktor's head, knocking him down. Alain pivots...

Mackintosh weakly smiles at Alain.




CHAPTER 22: THE LAST BULLET
---------------------------

Alain rushes to Mackintosh, kneeling besides him.

                      MACKINTOSH

          Couldn't let it happen that way, old 
          man. Not by his hand.

The two men gaze at one another with a mutual admiration. Mackintosh picks up on the stillness.

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

                      (referring to Riff 
                       infantry)

          They'll be here soon.

Alain slowly rises. He scans the remains of the fort. Death and destruction...

Alain looks down at his uniform. He brushes off the dust, straightening himself up.

Mackintosh, onto Alain, smiles up at him from the ground. 

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

          Listen, if by some miracle you get out 
          of this,...

CLOSE ON: Mackintosh, giving Alain a sly wink.

                      MACKINTOSH (CONT'D)

          ...will you do me a favor? Give a kiss 
          to your Katrina for me.

Alain reaches into his pocket, tossing his SINGLE BULLET to Mackintosh. He gives Mackintosh a nod and turns away... A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.

Alain takes one last look at Mackintosh. He notices Mackintosh's book of poetry, on the ground next to his dead body.

Alain picks up the book, walking toward the fort's front gate. Along the way he sees the FORT'S TATTERED FLAG laying on the ground and crouches down next to it.

Alain digs a HOLE in the ground. He retrieves GUIDO'S PICTURE of ANNA and LUTHER'S HARMONICA from his pocket. 

He places them, along with MACKINTOSH'S POETRY BOOK, into the hole and gingerly covers them with dirt. 

Alain picks up the FORT'S FLAG and proudly marches through the gate, meeting his fate with dignity. 




CHAPTER 23: SPARED
------------------

EXT. DESERT & FORT - DAY

The RIFF ARMY cautiously advances toward the DECIMATED FORT.

EXT. RIFF ARTILLERY POSITION - DAY

Abd-el Krim looks through BINOCULARS. He jerks away from them, surprised and... goes back to peering through glasses.

ABD-EL KRIM'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS: A LONE figure walks through the fort's gate. 

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bewildered, the RIFFS FRONT LINE halts... They raise rifles.

HAUNTING HARMONICA rendition of "Le Boudin." Ennobled, Alain picks up his pace, parading closer to Riff's front line... 

CLOSE ON: ALAIN. He tightens his jaw, reacting to the gunshot. 

                      GUIDO (V.0.)

          When Guido comes home, they'll see. 
          Guido will be a hero! Worthy of their 
          Anna.

NERVOUS RIFF MARKSMEN sight down Alain.

                      LUTHER (V.0.)

          All I gots-ta say, is nothin' means 
          shit in this world 'xpectin' how we 
          feel 'bout ourselves and each other.

Nothing phases Alain. He remains focused, delving deep into the heart of the Riff army.

                      MACKINTOSH (V.O.)

          "From little towns in a far land we 
          came, to save our honour and a world 
          aflame"

SWEATING RIFFS squeezes their TRIGGERS, trailing Alain's movement...

                      VOICE (O.S.)

          {Hold your fire!}

Abd-el Krim rides his HORSE past the marksmen, stopping in front of Alain.

CLOSE ON: ABD-EL KRIM scrutinizing Alain.

RIFF MARKSMEN itching to pull their triggers.

Abd-el Krim holds up his hand, indicating for his men to lower their weapons. They obey their leader's command. An UNGODLY HUSH overtakes the desert... A GENTLE WIND and SLIGHT FLAPPING OF ROBES.

Alain squints at the REGAL TOWERING RIFF, backlit by the HIGH NOON SUN...

Abd-el Krim slowly sweeps his outstretched hands over the desert. A distinct English speaking VOICE with a slight accent calmly emanates from the RIFF LEADER.

                      ABD-EL KRIM

          For centuries my people have roamed 
          across this land. It has always been 
          our home...

Abd-el Krim faces Alain.

                      ABD-EL KRIM (CONT'D)

          ...In our culture, a man who has 
          courage is valued above all. For this 
          reason, I will allow you to live.

Abd-el Krim re-adjusts himself in the saddle.

                      ABD-EL KRIM (CONT'D)

          We will not give up the land of our 
          fathers. What we demand is freedom, 
          peace and respect. Take a message to 
          your politicians.

Abd-el Krim points to the annihilated fort in bg.

                      ABD-EL KRIM (CONT'D)

          This is what awaits them, if they 
          continue invading our country.

Abd-el Krim spins his horse around, signaling for a turn-around to his men. He gallops his horse through his infantry.

The Riffs fall in behind him, trailing a DUST CLOUD.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

INT. "LE POIVROT" - NEW YEARS EVE 1926 - NIGHT

A scruffy and hell-ridden Alain -- dressed in DENIMS and a LONG PEA-COAT -- enters through the front door.

A party atmosphere in full swing. The room is decorated with BALLOONS and STREAMERS. Drunk guests wear PAPER HATS, blow on HORNS or twirl PARTY FAVORS. LOUD MUSIC.

As he crosses the Hat Check Girl, she breaks into a knowing grin. Alain moves through the crowded room with a focused and determined gaze to Galgani's table.

INT. "LE POIVROT" - GALGANI'S TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Galgani, Katrina, and THREE COUPLES turn their attention to Alain towering over them. Shocked, Katrina gapes at Alain.

                      KATRINA

                      (under her breath)

          Alain?!

                      ALAIN

                      (to Katrina)

          I'm not asking you to forgive me. And 
          I don't expect anything for the 
          future.

                      GALGANI

                      (overlapping)

          What future?

                      ALAIN

          Let Katrina speak for herself.

Galgani rises, waving his arm toward the hallway.

                      GALGANI

          Perhaps a little privacy. Why don't we 
          step into my office.

Alain raises an outstretched arm, aiming his LEGIONNAIRE PISTOL at Galgani. The orchestra stops playing. A hush silences the club.

                      ALAIN

          We do it here.

Galgani scrutinizes Alain, realizing that he is a different man.

                      GALGANI

          Very brave of you, Mr. Lefevre. 

                      (easing down in the booth)

          If that is what you wish.

                      ALAIN

          No, it's about Katrina's wishes. And 
          the freedom to make her own choices.

                      (or)

          freedom to do as she pleases.

Uneasy, Katrina side glances between the two men.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

                      (to Galgani)

          Give her your word.

Galgani's eyes narrow, unsure of Alain's next move.

                      GALGANI

                      (a slight nod)

          Fine.

Alain probes deep into Galgani.

                      ALAIN

          I've had it with killing. 

Alain tosses his pistol onto the table.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          A gift from La Legion.

Alain faces Katrina, drawing all he can of her into his being.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          You're free.

Fixated on Alain, Katrina's eyes widen.

Katrina'S POV: of her CROSS around Alain's neck. Her eyes drift up to...

Alain pivots, walking away.

Galgani glances at the gun. Katrina, picking up on his thoughts, reaches for the gun. He pulls it out of her reach.

                      KATRINA

                      (disgusted)

          You bastard!

Katrina rushes to Alain, walking alongside.

Crazed, Galgani stands with the gun aimed at Alain's back. Shocked and appalled, the crowd gasps.

                      GALGANI

          She's mine.

GUN HAMMER COCKING... Katrina shoots Alain a panicked look. Unaffected, Alain doesn't break their stride.

                      GALGANI

          No one can have her.

Galgani squeezes the trigger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK...

CLICK... Alain glances over to Katrina with a COOL GRIN.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          Something I learned in the Legion...

Alain tosses a BULLET into the air.

                      ALAIN (CONT'D)

          ...always keep your last bullet in 
          your pocket.

                      KATRINA

          You bastard. 

Alain gives Katrina a wink. They smile at each other, strolling through the club.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

The TRAIN'S BRAKE STEAM casts a mist across the platform.

A group of SCRUFFY RECRUITS lead by a LEGIONNAIRE CORPORAL-CHEF march down the platform.

                      CORPORAL-CHEF

          Allez!... Raus swine!... Stay in 
          formation. 

Alain trails the recruits movements as they pass.

                      CORPORAL-CHEF (CONT'D)

          Vite!... March you scum!... March or 
          Die!

ALAIN'S POV: The recruits dissappear into darkness, leaving an empty platform.

                      LUTHER (V.O.)

          Yessire, that's what keeps a man 
          livin'...

Alain shifts his eyes to the opposite end of the empty station.

ALAIN'S POV: A LONE FIGURE walks through the mist, revealing Katrina carrying a SUITCASE.

                      LUTHER (CONT'D)

          ...he's gots-ta have a dream.

Alain and Katrina meet in the center of the platform. A wistful smile crosses between them. 

Alain takes hold of her suitcase, slipping his hand into Katrina's. They walk to the train, climbing up its steps.

FADE OUT

THE END
