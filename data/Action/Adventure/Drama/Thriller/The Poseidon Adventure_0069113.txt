"THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE"

FADE IN

FULL ESTABLISHING SHOT - S..8. POSEIDON - NIGHT 1

A huge passenger liner built in the 1930's to carry a thousand passengers.
She rolls. in agony as she plows through piling seas.

EXT.. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT 2

Titles and credits appear over a series of shots of the great ship as she
fights her way through waves of staggering height churning with furious
force. Titles continue through the following:

ANOTHER ANGLE -- POSEIDON - NIGHT 3

Her bow dips, then rises as though trying to catch her breath, then dips
again, exposing her four screws above the surface of her stern.

EXT. SHIP - SHOOTING UP AT THE BOW - NIGHT 4

Again, the bow dips,.almost burying itself underwater, and in the wash
of tons of water as it rises again, we catch the ship's name: POSEIDON.

ANOTHER ANGLE - S. S.. POSEIDON - DAWN 5

A breathtakingly beautiful, blinding sunrise is now the background to the
continuing battle of the old ship against the overwhelming sea.

EXT, DECK AREA - S..S. POSEIDON - DAY 6-

It's now early morning on the almost deserted upper deck. No more
than three or four hardy passengers are daring the elements. A boy of
ten moves in darting fashion with the roll of the sea. He is ROBIN
SHELBY, a passenger,.an awesomely informed boy with sun-streaked
blond hair and a wiry little body hardened by growing up in the surf of
Manhattan Beach, California.

ANOTHER ANGLE - DECK AREA - APPROACH LADDER TO THE 7
BRIDGE - DAY

With the determination of a young man who knows where he's going, Robin
reaches the wooden ladder leading to the top deck. Full of vigor, he
moves up.

TITLES END

 
   

8 INT. BRIDGE OF POSEIDON - DAY 8

Cy In this. high place, the full effect.of the heavy swells can be felt.

° Through the windows of the bridge,. we can measure their height: against
the rise and fall of the horizon. The HELMSMAN clings to his helm,

a. JUNIOR OFFICER holds on to-a stanchion, the FIRST OFFICER steadies
himself at the engine room telegraph,.and a RADAR QUARTERMASTER
guards: his. set with difficulty. The CAPTAIN is:a tall man in his late
fifties, elegant-looking but strong. Another MAN, dréssed in a business
suit, watches the crew narrowly, missing nothing.

9 CLOSE SHOT - THE MAN 9

He is:LINARCOS. He has the look of an accountant-bookkeeper, sus-
picious: and mistrusting.

seeing a huge swell approaching. He braces himself. The:ship raises
in breathtaking fashion, then drops, wallowing. The Captain crosses
to the loudaphones, and speaks into one of them, not in panic but in
irritation and frustration.

CAPTAIN

This is the Captain. Is the Chief
still there?

Put him on.
ll INT.. ENGINE ROOM - DAY il
This is the heartbeat of the ship. As far as the eye can see, in every
direction, huge gears interlocked. with other huge gears respond to the
power released by the generators. They groan with the agony of age
but the pulse of power is deafening. .An-ASSISTANT ENGINEER who is
at the loudaphone at the log desk, answers the Captain.
ASSISTANT ENGINEER
Aye, aye, sir.
He turns to a WIPER standing nearby and calls over:

He takes a headset from a hook, hands it to the Wiper. The Wiper runs
down the catwalk to a group of maintenance men at the far end of the
engine room gathered around an apparently mal-functioning pump.

‘WIPER
(as he approaches
the group)
Chief -- the Captain wants: you on
the phone.

The Wiper hands over the headset and phone to the CHIEF, a large man
with a ruddy face and gruff manner, who slips on the headset and speaks
into it.

CHIEF ENGINEER
This is the Chief -- Go ahead.

There's nothing wrong with the stabilizers
so there's nothing more I can do with
them. Besides, I've got enough trouble
with this centrifugal pump. You know
damn well what the trouble is! That

The. Captain cuts off the contact with the engine room, gives Linarcos
a significant. and scornful look, returns to his post, at the same moment
Robin enters the bridge. The gale-force wind and spray almost blows
him through the door. .An OFFICER closes the door shut as. all hands
turn towards the boy.

ROBIN
(saluting)
Morning, sir. Reporting for duty.

CAPTAIN
Where did. you. come from ?

ROBIN
(as though it's
no problem)
From my cabin, sir. You said come
up any time .... Robin Shelby.
Remember ?

Robin's obvious lack of fear serves asa catalyst among the tight-faced
duty watch. The Captain looks around at his men, smiles slightly at
Robin. .

CAPTAIN
I must say, Master Shelby, you
picked a particularly fascinating
moment to accept my invitation.
Those waves don't worry you?

ROBIN
I've surfed up to eighteen feet ...
(looking out)
But these look more like thirty.

CAPTAIN
Thirty-five, matter of fact.

{| Voice slightly raised, yet with amusement in it, as though openly enjoy-

' ing his beliefs. He is REVEREND FRANK SCOTT, thirty-four, a rugged-

} looking, off-beat cleric wearing a.dark, nondescript and unpressed suit
over a black sweater whose turtleneck has long since collapsed.

Get down on your knees and pray to
God for help? Then everything's
going to work out fine? Garbage!
Not where I come from. You can wear
your knees off praying for heat in a
cold-water flat in February, and icicles
will grow on your upraised palms. If

We now see Scott near the rail of the ship. Standing nearby is the man
he's been talking to -- the ship's CHAPLAIN -~ a thin, wrinkled man in

a black suit and starched white collar who contemplates Scott reflectively
with mixed emotions.

CHAPLAIN
(mildly) :
Somewhat unorthodox, wouldn't you ~
say, Reverend Scott?

SCOTT
But realistic, Mac! We've got to
use our churches for something more
thanjust prayer.

CHAPLAIN
If you deliver sermons like that, it's
a wonder you're still an ordained
minister, Or are-you?

. SCOTT
The best kind -- angry, rebellious,
critical, a renegade -- most of my
so-called clerical powers taken away --
But still in business.

The ship rolls but the sea is considerably calmer. There's even a little
sunshine. The men start walking the deck, swinging their arms to keep
warm. :

TRACKING SHOT : "93

CHAPLAIN
‘Well, you seem to be enjoying the
punishment.

SCOTT

Punishment? The church has blessed me,
that's what it's done -- banished to a
new country in Africa! Hell, I had to look
it up on a map to figure out where I was
going. My bishop doesn't know it, but he's
given me exactly what I wanted -- elbow
room -- real freedom. Freedom to dump the
rules and the trappings -- freedom for me
to find God in my own way.—- and help

. others to do the same.

> jogging suit and new tennis shoes, a stocking hat with a tassle on the

back of his head. He jogs in place a moment, warming up, and we see
he's a smallish man, but wiry, healthy-looking, with curly red hair.
He is dutifully following the ritual he has laid out for this day, as he
has laid out so many, many other days of his life, substituting ritual and
over-organization for loneliness. He jogs out.the door.

visual inventory of the doctor and his nurse as penetrating as an X-ray.
This is MIKE-ROGO, in his: late forties.

The doctor opens his bag as though he's done it fifty-two thousand times
before and no surprises remain inside to startle him. He brings outa

He hands. the. capsules to the nurse, who moves toward the bed.
ANOTHER ANGLE 33

The doctor starts to close his bag. Rogo looks without understanding at
the bottle, then reaches over, closes a big hand firmly around the doctor's
wrist. The doctor looks from his pinioned forearm up to the man's face.

ROGO
Hold it, hold it. You mean to tell
me we've been waiting all this time
for you to-kiss her off with a couple
of pills and some crap about staying
in bed! How do you know she's
just seasick? Look at her! It
could be. something wrong with her.
You didn't even examine her.

Rogo releases the doctor's wrist. The nurse shakes a. thermometer.

LINDA
Shoot me, Mike. For crissake,
just shoot me.

The nurse inserts the thermometer into Linda's mouth, feels her pulse.

ROGO
There -- you see how sick she is!
I'll tell you what I think. It's food
poisoning. How the hell's she going
to swallow those pills if she can't
even swallow water?

The girl is one of a musica! group, accompanied by her brother TED. on

Reverend Scott is conducting the ship's religious service on the sundeck.
CC The ship's Chaplain sits to one side, somewhat anxiously. Among the |
. congregation we find Susan, Robin, Mr. Martin, and some ship's officers. |
Scott looks around at the faces. He speaks easily, but his intensity
grows during the sermon.

LL

ScoTrtT
You know, God's pretty busy. He's
got a long-term plan for humanity that
stretches far beyond our comprehension.
So it's not reasonable to expect Him to
concern Himself only with the individual.
The individual is important only to the
extent that he’s a creative link between
the past and the future -- in his children,
or in the contribution he makes to humanity.
Oh, that doesn't mean that God has forgotten
us. On the contrary he's given to each
. and every one of us a great and infinite
gift ~- a part of Himself -- a.spark from
His eternal fire to be nurtured within us --
to keep us warm, to strengthen our efforts. )
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your
problems -- pray to that part of God within
cai you. Have the guts to fight for yourself.

ROBIN
(whispering to Susan)
Gotta go to the john --

SUSAN
(whispering)
You already did! You sit right there
and listen!

SCOTT

(continuing)
God wants brave souls. He wants winners,
not quitters. If you can't win, you can at
least try to win. God loves triers.

(smiles at Robin

and Susan)
Right, Robin? -- Susan?

The deck has reversed its.slant.. Now, with terrifying swiftness, it
reverses once more, heaving-up, dangerously.

We see virtually subliminal shots. of:

a. At the Captain's. Table
Scott and Linda: are thrown together on the floor --even as Rogo is
knocked away from his wife. She starts to fall away, but Scott
clutches her.. Together they go rolling down the sloping deck.

b. .On the Stage
Crump falling into the instruments, hitting a note on the amplifier
which. causes the reverb to scream even higher electronically than
the mounting screams of women and the frightened shouting of men..
The rest of the musical group fall backward out of sight.

c. Atthe-Purser's Table
Terry and Susan separate as Susan is swept away. Robin holds
then slides away after her. Terry holds onto the table grimly.

d. At Tinkham's Table
Martin clings to his chair, bolted to the deck. Manny and Belle
disappear in the sliding tangle.

e. Dance Floor - (Nonnie dancing)
The roll hits the dancers.

INT. DIFFERENT AREAS OF DINING SALON 94
A series of swift cuts:

a. The lights in the stained-glass ceiling flicker, go out, flicker
again crazily, the salon in alternate semi-darkness and darkness,
exaggerating the chaos, making it seem like an LSD trip into a
hellish place.

b. Dishes, cups, knives, forks are hurled off the tables, as the whip
of the rollover progresses without letup.

The Poseidon gradually, inevitably, starts her final, irrevocable roll.

As the ship tilts sharply over, they react to the movement and the sound
of the approaching wave, are hurled over the railing as the angry waters
encroach on the bow, and fall to the decks below.

INT. SECTION OF BRIDGE - NIGHT 99

The starboard windows are smashed by the roaring sea. Water pours
in. Linarcos, first, then the Captain, the Watch Officer and the others
are struck by the gigantic wave and washed out of shot.

INT. RADIO ROOM - (TO BE INTERCUT WITH OTHER SHOTS OF 100

Water smashes through the closed portholes as the room starts to turn
upside down, flinging the Radio Operator into the rising water and finally,
after several intercuts, delivering him up close on caméra as the. water
rises above his head, submerging him completely in the upside down
radio room.

EXT, SEA - NIGHT 101

The. great ship Poseidon slides into the trough on her side like a flounder-

wave. Her lights flicker as she rolls -- and then go out.

Incongruously, yet spectacularly, the Christmas tree now hangs upside
down from the ceiling, its tinsel loops drooping sadly. Here and there
the floor of the salon which was the glass ceiling begins to. glow dimly

Scott and Robin enter onto the upside-down ceiling of the boiler room.
The ceiling is threaded with myriad pipes. It slopes downward to con-

to the door through which they have entered. Far above the catwalk
hang the great, exploded boilers which powered the ship. Two boilers
are ripped and torn, their tubular insides bulging out in a chaos of rup-
tured parts. Smoke and steam still hiss from broken piping. Scott
leads them down through a labyrinth of twisted pipe and across the bottom
of what had been a maneuvering platform in the boiler room. The flash-

Scott unfastens the rope around his waist and ties it to the girder. The
place is an inferno. Belle pulls herself up on the girder.

BELLE

You see, Mr. Scott, in the water
I'm a very skinny lady.

Belle tries to climb over the girder -- she suddenly is stricken with a

pain in her heart, falls back into the water. Scott goes after her -- grabs
and pulls her back to the edge of the pool towards the girder. He holds
her in his arms, unable to get her up.

shifts, turning the valve. He is clearing the escape route but there is
no way for him to climb back or for anyone to reach him. He hangs by
Ofie~arm onto the valve. The steam hisses more softly then, valve
closed, stops completely, revealing above it the once-more liberated
entrance to the propeller shaft.

ROGO
(to Martin with
intensity)
Okay! That's enough!
(shouting up to
the others above
him)
For Chrissakes! What are we
waiting for?

Rogo leaps across the chasm in the broken catwalk, lands on his chest,
his arms grabbing for support, his feet in space. He pulls himself up,
runs up the ladder, past the individual clusters of survivors, to the
oiler's walk, alongside Martin.

They all move forward seeking relief from the fiery hell they just left.
Most of. them flop forthe first time.in'a long while. They look about
these new, cramped and unpromising quarters. It's an ugly, no exit,
trap!

ROGO
All right, what now? A dead end.

ROBIN
(to Rogo)
Excuse me, sir, but I don't think so.

ROGO
(not. unkindly)
You.don't think what, kid?

ROBIN
(in his best encyclo-
pedia manner)
Well, you see, sir, I tried to tell
you... We're in Shaft Alley, and
co : nowhere is the steel hull thinner --
— because of the nautical trim of this
ship this hull is only one inch thick.

ROGO
All right, kid, all right.

Martin, who's been listening to something top side, interrupts suddenly.

MARTIN
Quiet! I think I hear something.

They all listen breathlessly. The faint sound of retreating footsteps
ona metallic surface can barely be heard.

MARTIN

My God, there is somebody out there!

Nonnie looks up, listening.

of metal -- and then, with almost maniacal fever, beats the ribbed
metallic hull. The clang becomes deafening. The others shrink from
the calliope of sound. Martin also picks up a piece of metal and starts
to hit another piece of equipment.

They watch as Rogo assails the deck. Nonnie moves to Martin.

Sweat streams down their necks, their neck muscles and veins bulge from

ROGO

He whacks the deck -- TAP TAP TAP inreturn. Stops. Listens.

Oh my God, there is somebody up

They all yell.

The Preacher was right! The beauti-

The torch completes its cutting, and the roughly-circular section of hull
falls with a resounding, clanging crash to the floor of the shaft tunnel --
and a golden stream of sunlight bursts through.

down on the deck -- the whirling shadow of its rotor can be seen.

Through the hole are the blue skies beyond, rhythmically cut by the

He and the Boatswain's Mate begin to help our group climb up. The

Susan and Robin, Martin and Nonnie, Rogo and Manny, each alone with
their thoughts as one by one they enter the copter.

Martin and Nonnie almost subconsciously move together, put their arms
around each other, and look at one another. Susan and Robin join

hands. Rogo turns away and enters alone. Manny stops and looks

The bow of the gigantic vessel suddenly dips beneath the glaze with .-
which the sun has varnished the surface of the sea and inevitably starts
to slide forward. The stern lifts high into the air and it seems she is
about to go into eternity silently when suddenly the ships standing

by tie down their whistle chords, sirens and hooters in a last mourning
cry and salute to the one-time queen of the sea. For a moment she
hangs there, then with a despairing finality, she slides beneath the
surface.
