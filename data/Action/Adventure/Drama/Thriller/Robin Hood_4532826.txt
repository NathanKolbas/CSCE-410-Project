THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY LEGEND...
FADE IN:
EXT. CASTLE UNDER SIEGE — NIGHT
A Byzantine fortress overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.

A FULL MOON illuminates a MEDIEVAL ARMY complete with a SIEGE
TOWER, CATAPULTS and BATTERING RAMS, ferociously ATTACKING
the fortress...

CASTLE MARCAPPUS ~ CYPRUS ~ JULY, 1191

The DEFENDERS of the castle fight back, but they’re
OUTNUMBERED ten~to-one.

THE CREW OF ONE ATTACKING CATAPULT

loads up a BOULDER and prepares to LAUNCH. One of them grins
as he cups his hands to his mouth and YELLS up at the Castle
Walls:

CYPRIOT CREWMAN
(in GREEK w/subtitles)
<<HERE'S YOUR DINNER, YOU ENGLISH
BASTARDS | >>

The Crewman releases the triggering mechanism and we FOLLOW
THE BOULDER AS IT SOARS HIGH UP INTO THE SKY -- but our view
SHIFTS, leaving the boulder to ARC OVER THE CASTLE WALL as we
SUDDENLY PLUNGE STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GROUND AND KEEP GOING,
DRIVING INTO THE SOLID DIRT, ten feet deep... twenty...
thirty -~ SUDDENLY BURSTING UPON AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER -—— a
TUNNEL « oo

INT. MINE ~ UNDER THE GROUND

An ENGLISH NOBLEMAN, barely 30 (middle-aged in 12th Century
terms), stripped to the waist, covered in dirt and sweat ——
but still wearing a battle helmet —-- makes his way through
the TORCH-LIT shadows of the TUNNEL, ita Low roof propped up
with rough-hewn WOOREN POSTS AND BEAMS. He's moving fash,
but being careful not to spill the WATER he's carrying in a
heavy BRASS POT...

INT. PAR END OF THE MINE

HALP-A-DOZEN ENGLISH TUNNEL SOLDIERS Line the walls of the
Mine. They are all stripped to the waist, covered in sweat
and dirt. ‘Thay carry ewords, maces, flaile, axes and
ENTRENCHING TOOLS -~ picks and shovels and wooden buckets.
None of them looks happy --
ENGLISH SOLDIER
Fucking hell. I came on crusade to
liberate Jerusalem and touch my
hand to the True Cross -- not fight
Greeks like a worm under the earth!

The English Soldier is suddenly CONKED ON THE HEAD from
behind --

NOBLEMAN
(WHISPERING)
Put on your helmet and be quiet.

All eyes turn to the Nobleman --

ENGLISH SOLDIER
(donning his HELMET)
Yes, six, Sir Robert. Sorry, but ~~

The Nobleman -- STR ROBERT TORNHAM ~~ presses his finger to
the Soldier’s lips and the Soldier shuts up. Tornham moves
to the END of the Mine and sets his bucket of water down
against the wall -- then can’t help but notice the eyes of
all the Soldiers staring at the water as if it were gold...

He hesitates ~-- then removes his own helmet, dips it into the
pot, FILLS IT WITH WATER ~~ then passes his helmet to one of
the men, motioning for him to pass it on down the line ~~

TORNBAM (NOBLEMAN)
(WHISPERING)
One sip per man.

Tornham‘’s water-filled helmet makes its way through the ranks
as he kneels down and stares at the brass pot...

The Soldiera keep SIPPING...

Tornham keeps staring at the pot, his steel-grey eyes
NARROWING as he studies the water...

The Soldiere exchange some looks ~~ what the hell is Tornham
doing?

Finally the first English Soldier's curiosity gets the best
of him. He silently approaches Tornham, kneels down beside
bim, WHISPERS in his ears

ENGLISH SOLDIER
Begging your pardon, Sir Robert ~~
but what are you -- ?
Tornham raises a hand to silence his questioner and keeps
staring at the water: the surface has ever-so-slightly begun
to UNDULATE...

Tornham DRAWS HIS SWORD, MOTIONS to the others to do the
game. He takes back his battle helmet, fits it on his head ~-

The Soldier STARES at the pot of WATER -~ watching FIRST in
confusion and then with dawning realization as its surface
starts to SWAY like a tide-pool --

TORNHAM
(a fierce WHISPER to the
Soldiers)
TO ARMS! Ready yourselves!

Tornham's eyes sweep across the MUDDY WALLS of the mine, then
shoot back to the brass pot of WATER, then back to the walls,
searching ~-

TORNHAM (CONT'D)
(suddenly POINTING his
SWORD)
Here.

 

All eyes lock onto the SECTION of the MINE WALL where Tornham
is pointing --

TORNAHM (CONT’D)
Torches.

Everyone SNUFFS THEIR TORCHES, turning the Mine pitch black.
Silence.

Then the MUFFLED SOUNDS of DIGGING, in time to the SWAYING oF
THE WATER IN THE BUCKET ~~

Then a SUDDEN CRACK in the MINE WALL ~~ almost exactly where
Tornham was pointing ~~ and the GLOW of TORCHLIGHT peeking
through...

The SOUND of VOICES speaking GRERBK...

ANOTHER CRACK and the MINE WALL starte to CRUMBLE, HANDS with
PICK-AXRES now pushing through...

The MINE WALL COLLAPSES INWARDS, CYPRIOT KNIGHTS now pushing
their way through into the shadows --

TORNHAM
NOW!
-- but before the Cypriot Knights can react the English
Tunnel Soldiers are on them, ATTACKING from the darkness at
close quarters, SLICING with their swords, HACKING with their
picks, taking out their surprised enemies one-by-onel

Steel flashes by torchlight and the Cypriot Knights try to
fight back, but they’re totally unprepared for the English
onslaught. The surviving Cypriots RETREAT back into their
OWN TUNNEL, Tornham and his fellow English Tunnel Soldiers
GIVING CHASE, YELLING GUTTURAL BATTLE-CRIES AS THEY GO!

EXT.. CASTLE UNDER SIEGE - NIGHT

The same CATAPULT CREW loads-up another BOULDER and the same
Crewman YELLS UP to the walls:

CYPRIOT CREWMAN
<<OPEN YOUR MOUTHS FOR DESSERT, YOU
ENGLISH BASTARDS {>>

The Crewman goes to fire the catapult -~ but before he can
make a move he’s run through with a SWORD!

Robert Tornham yanks his blade from the Crewman’s chest then
leads his SCREAMING, BLOODY AND HALF-NAKED TUNNEL SOLDIERS
OUT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CYPRIOT SIEGE MINE in a MERCILESS
SURPRISE ATTACK ON THE ENTIRE CYPRIOT ARMY!

Up on the parapets of the Castle Walls the remaining English
defenders watch and CHEER as their comrades proceed to win
the battle...

cur TO:
EST. MANORHOUSE ~ NIGHT

Close to the edge of a FOREST sits a cross between a mansion
and a castle, wealthy lodgings surrounded by a defensible
wall. But there's no sign of a siege here...

INT. MANORHOUSE ~ NTGHT

The GREAT WALL is filled with Foop and DRINK, along with
MUSIC and LAUGHTER. It’s a FEAST for well-to-do NOBLE and
KNIGHTLY FAMILIES, attended to by an array of MALE and FEMALE
SERVANTS. A ROUNDEL DANCE is in progress, MEN AND WOMEN age
14 and up twirling in each others arme to the flutes and
drums of the MUSICIANS and the lilt of the accompanying
CHORAL’ S VOICES. o +

A good time is being had by all -- but one good-looking YOUNG
MAN and equally well-—bred YOUNG WOMAN, both Nobles, are
dancing together and virtually glowing with joy.
Se

They exchange a series of looks, ending with each of them
NODDING to the other, then take advantage of the crowd to
surreptitiously DUCK OUTSIDE -~ the Young Woman reaching out
to SNATCH A GOBLET OF BRANDYWINE off a serving tray as she
@xLTB oes

BXT. MANORHOUSE ~ NIGHT

The Young Woman sips from the goblet and makes an impromptu
SPRINT for the forest, the Young Man giving chase ~~

EXT. FOREST ~ NIGHT

The Young Man watches as. the Young Woman leans back against a
LARGE TREE, raises the goblet to her lips and sucks it dry.

YOUNG WOMAN
(feigning sadness)
We're out of brandywine.

The Young Man pins her against the tree, pulls off her head-
dress, letting her hair tumble down onto both their faces ~~

YOUNG MAN
(hushed)
oe GOO.
-- and kisses her.
DEEPER IN THE FOREST

A STAG with a large pair of antlers silently watches as the
young noble couple begins to make love...

CLOSE ON THE YOUNG COUPLE

Wrapped in each others arms, kissing passionately -- until
the SOUND of a BREAKING BRANCH startles them. They freeze,
the Young Man peering into the shadewy woods around them ~—
The Stag emerges from the darkness.

The Young Woman smiles at the noble creature.

YOUNG WOMAN
He's beautiful.

The Young Man kisses the Young Woman on the neck --

YOUNG MAN
So are you.

She MOANS as he moves his lips towards her breasts --
A sudden HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND fills the night air ~-
Then a sharp, jagged THUD.

The eyes of both the Young Man and the Young Woman go WIDE,
their breath catching in their throats.

A single ARROW has gone through the Young Man’s BACK and into
the Young Woman’s CHEST, IMPALING them both INTO THE TREE.

The startled Buck races back into the woods -- leaving the
young couple frozen together in shock, bleeding to death...

cur TOs
EXT. CASTLE MARCAPPUS — DAWN

The Last time we saw this place it was under attack -- but
now it sits calm and peaceful beneath the warm light of an
early Mediterranean morning...

INT. CASTLE BED-CHAMBER -— BARLY MORNING

Robert Tornham wakes, throws off his blanket and sits up in
bed —- revealing himself to be completely naked. Blinks his
eyes, wipes sleep from them, takes a deep breath -- then
pulls himself out of bed, turns to the East, where the sun
has just risen, and kneels in PRAYER:

TORNEAM
Our Father, who desires that we all
be saved and gives us our daily
bread ~- the Holy Sacrament for the
goul and needful sustenance for the
body, For these I confide in you.
Amen.

Tornham crises, reaches over to a simple NIGHT-STAND, pours a
pitcher of WATER into a bowl and SPLASHES some on his face.
Then he wraps 4 piece of white linen around his index finger,
dips it fireat into the water, then in a small. TRON SAUCER OF
SALT -- and uses it to BRUSH HIS TEBTH. When he’s done he
crosses to the WINDOW, undoes an TRON BAR and OPENS THE
SHUTTERS, allowing the sunlight to stream in.

He breathes in the morning, opens his mouth in a great yawn,
then heads through a narrow ARCHWAY and down a narrow stone
PASSAGE that winds ite way to...

INT. BRIVY CHAMBER - EARLY MORNING

This ie what we now call the toilet. ‘Tornham ~~ still naked —-
sits down to do his business...
While he sits he studies a CHESSBOARD laid out beside his
seat, the pieces in the MIDST OF AN ONGOING GAME, He thinks
for a moment, makes a MOVE ~- then sping the board around, so
he’s now playing black instead of white -- considers a
moment, then makes another move...

cur TO:
INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - DAY
Tornham, now fully dressed, enters ~~ and furrows his brow at
the surprising sight of his SQUIRE, THOMAS LESLIE -~ 60, wise
but not wizened, still in impressive shape for his age -- who

is in the midst of PACKING up everything in the room in a
secles of BAGS and BOXES ~~

SQUIRE THOMAS
Good morning, Sir Robert. I trust
your breakfast met with approval?
Can you believe the locals on this
island prefer cow's milk on their
cereal to wine?

TORNHAM
Thankfully I have you to protect me
from such dire threats.
(ce: the packing)
What in God's name are you up to?

SQUIRE THOMAS

Tt seems word of your brilliant
counter-mining stratagem and its
utter defeat of the rebellious
locals reached the Royal ears of
King Richard -- and His Majesty was
quite impressed. In fact, he sent
you 4 personal message to that
effect ~~

(indicating an unrolled

PARCHMENT sitting on the

desk)
~~ which I took the liberty of
opening, not wishing to disturb
that blissfully deep slumber of
YOUrS

Tornham shoota the old man a Look.

TORNHAM
People warned me about employing a
squire who could read.
(nodding at the parchment
on the desk)
(MORE)
TORNHAM (cont'd)
So what does King Richard's
congratulatory letter have to do
with you packing up all my things?

SQUIRE THOMAS
i'm afraid it's a “good news, bad
news” letter, sir. It seems you
are no longer the Sheriff of
Cyprus.

Tornham Looks at his Squire in confusion -~

‘TORNHAM
What? That‘s not possible.
Richard appointed me for life.
(angrily)
Give me that letter.

The Squire pauses his packing, hands Yornham the parchment ~~

SQUIRE THOMAS
Yes, well, that was before he
decided to sell the Island and all
its contents and inhabitants to the
Knights Templar.

Now Tornham’s confusion turns to total disbelief --

TORNHAM
He sold the island? But we just
won a desperate victory over the

entire Army of Cyprus defending

this place for him.

SQUIRE THOMAS
And don't think he doesn’t
appreciate it. That's where the
good news comes in...

The Squire flips over the parchment and brings Tornham’s
attention to the writing at the bottom of the SECOND PAGE,
which carries an EMBOSSED ROYAL SEAL...

SQUIRE THOMAS (CONT'D)
Xou, Six Robert Tornham, are no
longer Sheriff of Cyprua but ~-
thanks to your well-proven loyalty,
courage and resourcefulness —- you
have just been appointed to be the
Sheriff... of Nottingham.

Tornham looka like someone just threw cold water on his face,
Me quickly reads over both pages of parchment for himself...
He doesn’t look happy or sad ~- just stunned.

SQUIRE THOMAS
(re: packing it up)
I assume I’1] find your chess set
in the privy...?

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE ~ DAY

I£ you can call it day, between the grey CLOUDS and DRIZZLING
RAIN. A PAIR OF HORSEMEN gallop their way down the muddy
remnant of a dirt ROAD... it’s Tornham and Squire Thomas,
both of their horses loaded down with SADDLEBAGS of food,
clothing and books...

SQUIRE THOMAS
(dry) .
Merry old England. Just as lovely
as I remembered it. Aren’t you
giad to be home, sir?

TORNHAM
Do you know where the word
“Sarcasm” comes from, Thomas?

SQUIRE THOMAS
I believe from the French
SAaLcasMme «a>

TORMTAM
»eewho got it from the Latin
Sarcasmus -~ which got it from the
Greek Sarkasmos ~- which got it
from the ancient Greek Sarkazein.
De you know what Serkazein means in
ancient Greek, Thomas?

SQUIRE THOMAS
An ignorant squire such as myself?
of course not, six. Please do
enlighten me.

An awkward beat -~

ORNHAM
Damm. IL can’t remember. But we're
nowhere near Greece anymore, ao if
you could lessen the amount of ~~

SQUIRE ‘THOMAS
Sarkazein?
10.

TORNHAM
It would be greatly appreciated.

The two travellers reach the top of a RISE IN THE ROAD and an
URBAN LANDSCAPE becomes visible in the distance laid out
below them...

NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND ~ SEPTEMBER, 1191
EXT. SUBURBS OF NOTTINGHAM — DAY

The road becomes lined with scattered HOUSES, which quickly
in turn give way to BIGGER, MORE EXPENSIVE and CLOSER-PACKED
HOUSES and TAVERNS. The road here bears some TRAFFIC, most
of it headed in the same direction as Tornham and Squire
Thomas: NORTH, towards a tall STONE WALL which looms in the
distance...

Outside one of the Taverns, an INN-~KEEPER spots Tornham and
Squire Thomas as they approach, emiles and CALLS OUT:

INN-KEEPER
Good-day to you, good-sirg! Within
this establishment of mine you
shall find all manner of comforts,
painted chambers and soft beds
piled so high with feather
mattresses you can nearly touch the
ceiling with your finger. Here is
your lodging for love affairs --
for you must trust me when I tell
you how sweetly becoming are those
lovely damsels who abide within!

Sguixe Thomas inspects the Tavern ~- several YOUNG WOMEN poke
their heads out of the windows, some attractive, some not,
but all locking weary.

TORNEHAM
I assume you are familiar with the
“Diverse Ordinances and
Constitutions for the Regulation of
Horrible Sin® as enacted by our
late, great King Henry IT, may God
bless his memory as he rests in
peace?

INN-KEEPER
(tentatively)
Mumm... I've heard of them.
di.

TORNHAM
Seo... if we were to enter your
“establishment” we would find no
woman residing there whom you
charge more than fourteen pence a
week for hex room?

INN~KEEPER
(nervously)
Those ordinances were a long time
ago! Prices rise, the value of
money falls. You have to keep up
with the market.

TORNHAM .
Nonetheless, I advise you to lower
the rent you charge in accordance
with the law of the land. I/‘11
send a Bailiff by to check -- and
i£ you're not in accordance, to
levy the appropriate fines.

Tornham turns his horse round and makes for the gate. squire
Thomas confides to the Inn-Keeper --

SQUIRE THOMAS
There's a new Sheriff in town.

EXT. NOTTINGHAM - MAIN GATES ~ DAY

Tornham and Squire Thomas reach an OPEN pair of massive
WOODEN DOORS set in the STONE WALL which stretches around the
entire perimeter of the CITY.

A steady stream of TWO-WAY TRAFFIC is passing in and out
under the watchful gaze of a pair of GUARDSMEN, One of them
WAVES to Tornham and Squire Thomas:

GUARDSMAN
Please identify yourselves,
gentlemen.

Tornham starts to reply, but Squire Thomas jumps in first ~~

SQUIRE THOMAS
Sir Robert Tornham »~ the newly
appointed Sheriff of Nottingham.

the Guards exchange a look and don't seem convinced. Tornham
reaches beneath his suxrcoat, pulls out the PARCHMENT and
shows them the EMBOSSED ROYAL SEAL..
12.

SQUIRE THOMAS
I doubt you boys can read but I
have faith you can recognize the
Great. Seal of King Richard -- can’t
you?

The Guardsmen’s eyes go wide and they quickly BOW their heads
to Tornham and gesture for him to pass ~- then one begins
cringing an ALARM BELL perched atop the gates -~

SQUIRE THOMAS
I would advise us both to be
prepared for either a shower of
riches or a surprise attack,

Tornham and Squire Thomas ride on into the HEART OF THE CITy.
It is a late 12th Century METROPOLIS and so far as English
cities go, second only to London in its population,
urbanization and sophistication.

Before Tornham and Squire Thomas can get much further up the
MAIN ROAD they are suddenly SET UPON by a NOBLEMAN on
horseback, accompanied by FOUR KWIGHTS, all five horsemen
CHARGING their way through the CITY STREETS, pulling their
mounts to a stop just in front of Tornham and his squire ~~

The Nobleman -- intense eyes, chiseled face and chiseled
body -- nods from atop his horse:

NOBLEMAN

Sir Robert Tornham, Sheriff of
Nottingham, I presume? I’ve been
expecting you.

(pulling his horse up

alongside Tornham,

offering hig HAND)
Guy of Gisborne. I've been serving
as acting sheriff until a royal
appointment was made for the
office.

TORNEAM
(SHAKING Gisborne’s hand)
Pleasure to meet you, Sir Guy.

GISBORNE (NOBLEMAN)
Pardon me for agking, Sir Robert,
but... where is your escort? Your
retainers?

Squire Thomas clears his throat, raises a hand -~
13.

SQUIRE THOMAS
That would be me.

Gisborne skeptically eyes the old man.

GISBORNE

Wo offense, Sir Robert -- but one
rusty man-at~arms? It’s insanity.
There are murdering thieves hiding
behind every bush in England these
days -- especially along the Great
North Road which you took up from
Londen.

Squire Thomas starts to reply but Tornham cuts him off --

TORNHAM
All no doubt looking to ambush and
rob blind every Nobleman trotting
through the woods with an
impressive entourage and wagons
filled with treasure and fineries.

(a beat)

i've got one wagon coming with all
my belongings and the rest of my
retainers. They should be here in
the next few days.

Gisborne acknowledges this with a reluctant nod and indicates
an impregnable-looking CASTLE atop the bill at the center of
the city --

GISBORNE
Your office awaits you in
Nottingham Castle. Castle Hill is
also the Norman section of the
city. You'll want to stay close
after hours. The Saxon section is
on Saint Mary’s Will -~ though
there’s not much “saintly* about
At.

Gisborne continues with the guided TOUR, he and his knights
leading Tornham and Squire Thomas on THROUGH THE cry ~~
PEASANTS & TOWNSFOLK, LORDS & LADIES, KNIGHTS & SERVANTS all
going through their daily routines...
14.

SQUIRE THOMAS

(chiming in)
I believe this town was founded by
some of my Saxon ancestors after
they invaded the island and wrested
great swathes of it from the
ancient Britons who inhabited it at
the time. The Saxon chieftain in
this region was a man named Snot
and so this place was originally
named Snottingham.

(WHISPERING to Tornham)
Sarkagein,

Gisborne glares at the old Squire as Tornham suppresses a
grin --

TORNAHM
(to Gisborne)
What’s the population grown to
these days, Sir Guy?

GISBORNE
Two-thousand give or take. Second
only to London according to the
latest census. A few less recently
thanks to that bastard, Hood.

Toernham narrows his eyes -~-

TORNHAM
Who?

GISBORNE
You haven’t heard of him? I’m
surprised. The riff-raff have
started to compose ballads
celebrating his various crimes,

TORNHAM
News from Nottingham doesn’t reach
all the way to Cyprus.

GISBORNE
Hoed -- Rebin of Locksley before he
turned outlaw -- is a lesser

nobleman of Saxon descent who hag
been robbing, pillaging and now
murdering those of Noble birth and
Norman deacent for the last six
months. The serfe and peasants
proclaim him some sort of rebel
champion.

(MORE)
GISBORNE (cont'd)
A hero of the “common folk” because
he throws them a few pennies now
and again to keep their mouths shut
as to his whereabouts.

(shrugging)

And so long as he only kills
wealthy Normans the peasants and
townsfolk could care less. They
blame his murders on the Jews --~
though I've yet to meet a Jew who
can shoot a strong bow well enough
to kill two people with one arrow.
Speaking of which...

Gisborne nods to a RUN-DOWN SECTION OF THE CITY, a JEWISH
STAR painted on an old wooded sign nailed to a post marking
the neighborhood.

GISBORNE
Saint Nicholas Lane -- the entrance
to the Jewish quarter.

SQUIRE THOMAS
God's chosen people.

GISBORNE,
More like God’s cursed. Last year
they were burned out of York. Most
of the survivors came to join their
brethren here. They live piled
atop one another like rats.

Tornham SEES a boarded-up SYNAGOGUE in the distance and nods
to Gisborne ~~

TORNHAM
Tf that’s the case, why is their
synagogue boarded up?

GISBORNE
It's only a few years old.
Richard's new law declared that
only those Jewish churches which
stood during his father’s reign
could remain open, go we shut thie
one down. People say they gather
to pray in their butcher shop now —-
where it’s easy to slaughter
Christian children and collect
their blood.

fornham exchanges a lock with his Squire...
16.

SQUIRE THOMAS
No surprise there -- most of what
people say is nonsense.

cur To:
EXT, NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - DAY
THE DOORS are opened to admit Gisborne, Tornham and the
others. They ride on, through the TUNNEL-LIKE interior of
the castle GATEHOUSE and into...
EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

VALETS take charge of the horses as Tornham, Gisborne and the
rest dismount -—-

TORNEAM
I'd like to see the bodies.

GISBORNE
Excuse me?

TORNHAM
The two you said were killed with
one arrow. Tell me, who raised the
hue and cry when they were first

discovered?
An awkward moment of silence ~~ then Sir Guy confesses:
GISBORNE
To be honest, Sheriff --- I don't

really know. Does it matter?

Tornham lets it slide and moves ons

TORNHAM
The scene of the murder then. 711
have to gee that -- and anything

else you have relating to the
earlier murders as well.

GISBORNE
As you wiwh. Still, it seems a
waste to me. Dead is dead and the
killer is known to all.

TORNHAM
Right. “Hood” -~ formerly
Locksley. Well... I would

appreciate it nonetheless.
a7.

Gisborne stares at Tornham for a moment, then sighs =- and
smiles.

GISBORNE
I’m actually quite happy to be
replaced, you know. I’m a soldier.
War is my vocation. ALi this dealing
with law, inquests, evidence... it’s
quite senseless to me.

Gisborne nods, BOWS to Tornham and marches off...
cur TOs
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER — DAY

Tornham and Squire Thomas light CANDLES and place them
throughout the large stone room...

The DOOR suddenly swings OPEN and half-a-dozen LABORERS enter
carrying TWO LARGE SACKS --

Tornham and the old squire recoil from the SMELL -~

LABORER #1
Where‘d ya’ want ‘em, Sheriff?

fornham POINTS to a LARGE WOODEN TABLE in the center of the
chamber.

The Laborers sling both linen bags up onto the tables, then
BOW and leave.

Tornham and Squire Thomas quickly tie SCARFS around their
faces and approach the bags...

SQUIRE THOMAS
Only two bodies, six?

Tornham nods as Thomas takes out a SHEAF OF PARCHMENTS and a
QUILL PEN and begins to WRIT# as Tornham speaks —~

TORNHAM
Gieborne said there were three more
before these ~~ each struck down
with a aingle arrow ~- but those

others have been buried in the
earth too long to be of use to
UB eee

Tornhamn unwraps BOTH BAGS ~~ revealing the still relatively
intact. BODIES of the YOUNG MAN and YOUNG WOMAN. ‘Tornham
leans close, carefully INSPECTING both corpses -~
18.

TORNHAM (CONT’D)
They both have two wounds -~ entry
and exit. Which would probably
place them on top of one another at
the time of death.

SQUIRE THOMAS
I ¢an think of worse ways to end
one's existence, sir.

TORNHAM
Don't let a priest hear you say
that, Thomas, Our existence is not
supposed to end with death.

Tornham SEES something on the Young Man’s FACE -- a SUBSTANCE
which he carefully scrapes off with his fingernail and sets
aside in a SMALL BOWL. He inspecte the body of the Young
Woman, finds some on her lifeless face as well.

SQUIRE THOMAS
What’s that, sir?

TORNHAM
Beeswax,
Tornham searches through the rest of the bags ~~ nothing,
just the bodies.
TORNHAM

Dammit. Not a stitch of clothing.
Or the arrow.

SQUIRE THOMAS
They must have declared the murder
weapon a deodand ~~

TORNHAM
~~ a “donation te God,” and seld it
off to the highest bidder, yes.
And the clothes were probably
burned ~~

SQUIRE THOMAS
To keep theix immortal souls from
getting stuck inside a tunic or
gown en route to heaven. Happens
all the time -- or so the priests
would say.
19.

TORNHAM
{growing angry)

These fools didn't bother to record
who discovered the bodies, hold a
proper inquest or preserve any
evidence. How are we to solve
these heinous crimes when all the
evidence is gone?

SQUIRE THOMAS
(shrugging)
Six Guy didn’t seem to believe
there was anything to solve, sir.

Tornham throws the sackcloth back over the bodies in
frustration ~~

TORNHAM
Hood.

cur TO:
EXT. FOREST - DAY

The edge of the woods surrounding the Manorhouse where the
Young Couple were killed.

Gisborne, Tornham and Squire Thomas ride up on horseback,
Gisborne in the lead -~

GISBORNE
This is the place.

Tornham and Squire Thomas dismount, Gisborne watching from
atop bis horse.

GISBORNE (CONT'D)
It’s been weeks. I‘im sure the
rains have washed away all traces
ef blood and gore... if that is
what you hope to find.

 

Tornham doesn’: reply. Instead he carefully inspects the
area -- especially the TRUNK of a large TREN jutting from the
ground.

GISBORNE
He hides in these woods, you know.
TORMHAM,
{eyes still on the tree
trunk)

Who?
20.

GISBORNE
Hood. He has some four-score men
who follow him -- and they lurk
behind these very trees,
camouflaged in Lincoln Green. They
wait for unsuspecting fools to
provide them with sport, then
disappear into the greenwood like
the moon on a cloudy night.

CLOSE ON THE TREE TRUNK
A DEEP GASH visible in the bark --

TORNHAM

The young lovers. They were
impaled on this tree, were they
not? Here's the spot where the
arrow hit, One arrow -- through
the back -- blood, tissue, bone -~-
and it keeps going, through more
flesh and bone, out another back -~
imbedding in this tree.

(chewing on his lip)
It would take at least a 150 pound
pull to penetrate all that. And
definitely an armor-piercing bodkin --
no standard arrow could do this. And
the shooter would have to be close.

GISBORNE
If you say so, Sheriff. My weapon
of choice is the sword.

TORNHAM

(explaining)
An upright bow is accurate up to
400 yards but killing range is less
than balf that. Richard’s foot~
soldiers prefer more modern
crossbows but some still use this
traditional weapon. I’ve seen it
often in France, Italy and Cyprus -~-
though I've never been particularly
handy with a bow either. My weapon
of choice is algo the blade.

Tornham motions for his squire ~~

TORNHAM
Thomas -- rope please.
al.

Squire Thomas nods, quickly retrieves a BUNDLE of thin ROPE
from a saddlebag and HOLDS ONE END UP TO THE ARROW-GASH in
the tree-trunk. Tornham estimates the ANGLE OF FIRE, takes
the rope in his hands and WALKS OFF through the foliage,
TRAILING THE ROPE TAUTLY BEHIND HIM as he JOCK. oe

Tornham keeps walking until his way is BLOCKED BY ANOTHER
TREE -— roughly 75 YARDS away from the murder site.

Gisberne turns to Squire Thomas:

GISBORNE
What in God‘s name is he doing?

SQUIRE THOMAS
Trying to discover exactly where
the murderer stood when he fired
the shot.

Tornham turne and stares back through the foliage ~~ he has a
PERFECT SIGHT-LINE to the tree where the Young Couple were
killed. Tornham rejoins Gisborne and Squire Thomas ---

TORNHAM
(pointing to the Manorhouse)
Who lives there?

GISBORNE
Lord Fitawater. It was his party
the unfortunate young couple
wandered off from that night.

TORNHAM
What was the occasion?

GISBORNE
His daughter, Marian. She sits at
home each night, wasting her
beautiful young Life away waiting
for her lover to return. I believe
her father was trying to distract
her. Remind ber there are other
birds in the bush and bees in the
hive. Encourage her to move on.

TORNHAM
Who's the man who commands such
undying loyalty?

GISBORNE
(tight }
Her lover was Robin of Locksley.
22.

Tornham and Squire Thomas exchange a look -~ this is getting
more interesting by the moment...
CUT TO:
INT. ST. JOHN‘’S. HOSPITAL - DAY
No doctors or surgical facilities -- in fact it’s closer to a

modern HOMELESS SHELTER or HALFWAY HOUSE than a medical
facility. The INMATES include a mix of the OLD, the
DESTITUTE and the DISABLED -- ag well as able-bodied but
impoverished WAYFARERS and those local SICK too ill to care
for themselves and too poor to afford a doctor. There is
also one last category of inmate: the MENTALLY DERANGED -~
one of whom has been ferociously tearing at his side deep
enough to draw blood with his long fingernails:

MADMAN
STAY AWAY FROM ME, YOU TEMPTRESS OF
ABOMINATION!

A YOUNG LADY VOLUNTEER is trying to settle him down. Her
face has a fiery beauty but her eyes are much calmer, much
older, perhaps even a little wise —-~

LADY VOLUNTEER
Master Haley, I am not here to
tempt you but to tend to you.
Before IT can do so you must return
to your bed, take a breath and
relax.

He SCAMPERS away and THROWS THINGS to block her approach --

MADMAN HALEY
CALL A MONK! I WANT A GOOD SON oF
ADAM MINISTERING TO ME, NOT A VAIN
DAUGHTER OF EVE!

The Lady Volunteer makes a grab for the Madman but he
SCAMPERS AWAY again, this time CLIMBING ATOP A BED bearing a
CRIPPLED YOUNG MAN using a fork to feed himsel£ Junch ~—

MADMAN HALEY
(tearing at bis side more
forcefully)
God ripped me and every man asunder
in order to create you harlots!

Understanding suddenly dawns on the Lady Volunteer’s face ~~
23.

LADY VOLUNTEER
Ripped asunder? You speak of
Adam’s rib?

MADMAN HALEY
of course! On account of you we
are incomplete, hollow and empty
inside!

The Lady stares up at the Madman for a moment, then calmly
smiles up at hime

LADY VOLUNTEER
Shall I tell you what the reverend
master Peter Lombard, a good son of
Adam and a great man indeed, had te
say on this very same subject?

MADMAN HALEY
“Lombard”? Was he Italian? I do
like Italian wine.

LADY VOLUNTEER

(moving CLOSER and CLOSER

to him as she speaks)
Well it was his view that God made a
most perfect selection when he chose
Adam’s rib for the creation of Eve.
God did not make woman from Adam’s
head, for she was not. intended to be
his ruler, nor from his feet, for she
was not intended to be his slave, but
from his side -- for she was intended
to be his companion and his friend.
Not to make him hollow and empty as
you claim, but complete and whole.
The final masterpiece of creation.

By now the Lady is standing smack in front of the Madman on
top of the bed ~- but his demeanor has changed and he remains
quite calm. He ponders something for a moment, then shakes
hie head:

MADMAN HALEY
Those Italians may know wine but
they don‘t know women.
(going ice cold)
i gay all you heartless witches
deserve to die.

Madman Haley suddenly SNATCHES THE FORK out of the Crippled
Young Man’s hand and goes to STAB the Lady with it!
24,

But she manages to GRAB A PILLOW OFF THE BED and uses it to
BLOCK THE THRUST!

The rest of the Inmates watch in shock and disbelief from
their beds as the Lady and the Madman FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL
for the fork --

A STRONG ARM SUDDENLY WRAPS ITSELF AROUND THE MADMAN’S NECK
AND YANKS HIM OFF THE LADY AND OFF THE BED -~—

It's Tormham. He holds Madman Haley flailing wildly in his
arm for a moment, then POUNDS A FIST INTO THE BACK OF HIS
HEAD, knocking him UNCONSCIOUS, and lets him drop to the
floor.

LADY VOLUNTEER

What. have you done?!

Without skipping a beat, the Lady goes to Madman Haley's side
and examines him with gentle concern...

TORNHAM
What have I done? Milady, are you ~~

LADY VOLUNTEER
IT am not your lady and z do not
appreciate your “heroic rescue.” Now
come help me get this poor man back
inte his bed!

Tornham does as he’s told and together he and the Lady carry

the Madman over to his empty bed and lay him down on it. The
_thady instantly starts tending to Madman Haley's self-

inflicted WOUND, using clean water, balm and bandages...

LADY VOLUNTEER
He has for some time been fallen
out. of his right mind and I assure
you that beating on him Like an
animal will not restore his wits.

TORNHAM
Tt was not his wits I was concerned
with restoring but your safety,
Ma‘am., Forgive me if I have
offended you but I believe most men
in my position would have been far
less merciful and xun the maniac
through with their sword.

LADY VOLUNTEER
On the road or in the forest
perhaps ~~ but not in a hospital.
(MORE)
28.
LADY VOLUNTEER (cont'd)
There are different. rules of
behavior here.

The Lady suddenly lifts her eyes from the Madman’s wounds and
really looks at Tornham for the first time...

LADY VOLUNTEER
Do I knew you?

Tornham looks back at her...

TORNHAM
No.
DADY VOLUNTEER
(turning her eyes back to
the patient)
Good.

Tornham stands there rather uncomfortably, aware of being
watched by all the other Inmates while the Lady volunteer
keepe tending to the unconscious Madman. Tornham clears his
throats

TORNHAM
Ma’am, you do not know me but I am
in fact here to see you.

LADY VOLUNTEER
Are you destitute?

TORNHAM
No.
LADY VOLUNTEER
Crippled?
TORNHAM,
(anneyed)
No.

LADY VOLUNTEER
Lill -- but witheut means to afford
@ iearned doctor's care?

TORNHAM
(really annoyed)
io.
DADY VOLUNTEER
Then T am afraid we have no
facility to serve you.
26.

TORNHAM

(losing his patience)
I am not here for your service,
woman -- but for mine. I am Sir
Robert Tornham, newly-appointed
Sheriff of this city of Nottingham
~~ and I must speak with you on
sheriff's business.

(a sudden afterthought)
You are Maid Marian Fitzwater, are
you not?

MAID MARIAN ~~ the Lady -~ gives him a lool:

MARIAN (LADY VOLUNTEER)
How did you guess?

TORNHAM

I was told you are most uncommonly
devoted to your work.

{a beat)
Now, if you've finished binding your
maniac’s wound, I suggest we find
someplace less crowded with the
infirm and impoverished to talk.

Marian studies Tornham, considers his words...
curt TO:
EXT. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL - DAY
Tornham watches as Marian tends with a SPADE to a large

GARDEN on the Hospital grounds. It’s filled with flower
beds, fruit trees, vegetables and herbs --

TORNHAM

Your garden is beautiful.
MARTIAN

Thank you.
TORNHAM

And no doubt totally unappreciated
by the lunatics inside.

Maxian shoots him a look, pissed.
27.

MARIAN

But it igs well appreciated by the
great majority of patients who are
not mad but simply poor and
homeless -~- and even the mad
appreciate the power of the
medicinal herbs to lessen their
affliction.

{a beat)
Please ask your questions and go.

Tornham bites back some bile, proceeds:
TORNHAM

I’m told the Hospital staff here
dips their own candles...

MARIAN
(nodding)
I doit. It's much cheaper that
way ~~ as long as you know what

you're doing. Though I don’t see
why it would be of concern to you.

TORNHAM

It's been my experience that during
criminal inguiries, such small
details invariably help reveal that
which would otherwise remain
hidden.

(a beat)
You are a... friend of the outlaw
Robin Hood, known in his previous
life as Six Robin of Locksley.

MARTIAN
Is that a question?

TORNDAM
No, Ma‘am, it's a etatement of fact --
ig it not?

MARTAN
Not quite. I'm actually hig
fiancee.
Tornham tries to bide his surprise -~ but fails.

MARIAN (CONT*D)
We were just about to marry when he
was unjuetly outlawed.

(MORE)
28.

MARIAN (CONT’D)

We decided to postpone the marriage
until his good name is exonerated
and his lands and titles restored
by good King Richard.

(a beat)
It was Robin's idea. He wanted to
wait until he could provide a
normal life for us —- be a proper
- husband.

TORNHAM
80 you're waiting for Richard to
return from the crusades? Do not
hold your breath.

Marian shoots him another look.

MARIAN
Clearly you know nothing of love,
Sheriff. Of the sacrifices a
person can make in ite name.

Tornham shrugs.

TORNHAM
I know a good deal about love ~~
but what I love is justice. And I
am prepared to make sacrifices in
its name.

Marian keeps glaring up at the Sheriff --

MARIAN
I have to go.
(standing up)
My patients need me.

TORNEAM
You say he was “unjustly” outlawed?

MARTAN
He came to the defense of a miller
who had killed one of the king's deer
to feed his starving family. The
miller was executed and Robin
sentenced to be blinded for having
defended him. He fled to the forest.

TORNEHAM
And began taking bis revenge upon
the Nobles who ruined his
privileged life by hunting them -~
the way the miller hunted the
king's deer.

(MORE)
TORNHAM (cont'd)
{a beat)
Do you still see him?

Marian doesn’t reply ~- instead she turns and heads back
inside the hospital. Tornham just watches her go... and
sighs. She is guite beautiful.

TORNHAM
(to himself)
I could just torture it out of you,
you know.

Cur TOs
EAT. NOTTINGHAM - MAIN GATES — DAY

The Guardsmen share a FLASK and watch over the hustle and
bustle of the city -- until suddenly SEVERAL HORSES come
charging towards the gates...

GUARDSMAN
What the hell...?

Each horse has a RIDER -- but they are all NAKED, tied across
their horses’ backs!

cur TO:
EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

The naked Riders -- Tornham’s RETAINERS & ESCORTS, all of
them bruised, battered and bloadied -~ are being untied from
their horses by the Guards.

Tornham and Squire Thomas arrive, followed by Gisborne and a
couple of his Knights ~--

TORNEAM
What happened?

RETAINER #1
Outlaws, sir. ALL dressed in
green, blended right inte the trees
they did.

RETAINER #2
Ambushed us, stole the wagon, all
your baggage -- stole everything.

ESCORT
(nursing a BLOODY WRIST)
Weren‘t sneaky about it either.
Leader was a real braggart.
(MORE)
30.

ESCORT (cont'd)
Called himself “Hood” and said he
didn't care who knows it.

Gisborne smiles at Tornham -- “I told you so.”
Tornham takes a deep breath. Turns to Squire Thomas, tense --

TORNHAM
My chess set. Tell me you took it
with us.

The old man shrugs apoloegetically --

SQUIRE THOMAS
I, um... J thought it was less
likely to be lost or damaged if I
left it in the wagon, sir.

Tornham nods. Tries to get control of his anger.

TORNHAM
(to his men)
Anyone besides Jack injured?

The Retainers exchange looks, shake their heads. Tornham
turns to Gisborne ~~

TORNHAM
These men will be joining the
castle garrison. See to it that
they are cleaned up, get them hot
food, any medical attention they
need and show them to their
quarters.

. SQUIRE THOMAS
(chiming in)
We'll get them some clothes as
well.

Tornham shoots bis old squire a look, then marches back
inside, visibly upset...

cur TOs
S&T. SUBURBS OF NOTTINGHAM ~ DAY

A COMMOTION has begun. People are GATHERING and a palpable
EXCITEMENT is in the air and now we see what it’s about:
31.

A vast PROCESSION is approaching the outskirts of the city --
it‘s a ROYAL HOUSEHOLD travelling on HORSEBACK and in WAGONS,
everything from COOKS and BUTLERS to PRIESTS and COUNSELORS,
carrying their packed-up kitchens, beds, desks and documents
with them, all watched over by a atrong force of FOREIGN
MERCENARY KNIGHTS. Up at the very front a HERALD announces:

HERALD
MAKE WAY FOR HIS GRACE PRINCE JOHN!

PRINCE JOHN wears a modest crown on his head and a well-
trimmed beard on his youthful 25 year-old face. He is one of
the most powerful men in Bngland and not at all bad looking ~-
but bitterness and insecurity fill most of the space where
his confidence should be. He flashes insincere smiles at his
gathering SUBJECTS as they WAVE and CHEER and CALI, HIM BY
NAME -- though when the Subject in question is an attractive
woman or girl his smile grows more heartfelt.

Riding beside John is ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE ~- who has
remained THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND, despite the fact that her son
Richard ~- the absent King -- is married to a queen of his
own. At age 72 she is still strikingly attractive and an
excellent horsewoman.

Prince John grins at hig mother:

PRINCE JOHN
Do you hear them? Can anyone
dispute that I am loved by my
people?

QUEEN ELEANOR
Love is a fine thing, my son -~ but
swords are more dependable, castles
more defensible and gold more
easily transferable.

SMASH CUT TO:
ES?. FOREST - DAWN
& sun-dappled GLADE deep in the greenwood. The same powerful
STAG present at the double-murder scene cautiously emerges
from behind a wall of trees and bushes. He cocks his head
with their huge antlers and listens for a moment -~ then
RACES OFF AT TOP SPEEDO deeper into the forest...
The PIERCING NOTE OF A HORN echoes amongst the trees ~~

~~ then a PACK OF BLOODHOUNDS comes CHARGING after the Stag,
BARKING LIKE MAD ~~
32,

-- and a half-dozen HORSEMEN COME CRASHING out of the trees
behind the dogs. Prince John is in the lead and with him are
the most powerful NOBLE MEN and WOMEN from his household and
the Nottingham area ~~ including Guy of Gisborne, Sheriff
Tornham, Queen Eleanor and Lady Marian, escorted by a strong
force of ROYAL GUARDS...

EXT. DEEPER IN THE FOREST ~ DAY

The Stag pauses where several THICK OAKS have been uprooted
by storms and formed a FOREST CAVE, complete with a narrow,
shadowy entrance...

EXT. FOREST ~ DAY
Prince John leads the hunt deeper into the woods at full tilt --
EXT. DEEPER IN THE FOREST ~ DAY

The PACK OF HOUNDS reach the FALLEN OAK CAVE and freeze in
their tracks, SNIFFING around the shadowy entrance --

Prince John and his hunting party gallop up and rein in their
horses. A moment later the DOG KEEPERS arrive on foot --

DOG KEEPER
The hounds have him, Your Grace!

PRINCE JOHN
(smiling to his fellow
hunters)
Question is ~- which of we noble
hounds will have his blood?

Prince John draws a pair of DANISH THROWING AXES from his
saddle, DISMOUNTS and carefully approaches the Oak Cave. The
other Noblemen all draw axes, spears or bows and dismount as
well ~~

GISBORNE
Take care, Your Grace, A cornered
beast is the most dangerous of all.
PRINCES JOHN
True, Six Guy. But no beast has
escaped my axes yet...

SUDDENLY SOMETHING CRASHES OUT OF THE OAK CAVE -- not the
Stag, but a WILD BOAR who uses the cave as his lair!

The Boar CHARGES STRAIGHT AT PRINCE JOHN!

The Prince freezes in fear --
33.

-- but Tornham RUSHES OVER and IMPALES the beast on his
SPEAR!

The huge Boar struggles ferociously, YANKING the spear OUT OF
TORNHAM'S GRASP and GOERS FOR JOHN AGAIN ~~

-- but just before he is upon the Prince another member of
the Hunting Party LAUNCHES AN ARROW STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE
BOAR’S EYES, KILLING HIM INSTANTLY!

The archer is Lady Marian.

Everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief as the boar collapses
in a heap.

Prince John steadies his nerves -- then forces a thankful
grin to Marian and Tornham.

PRINCE JOHN
Lady -~ six. My deepest thanks.

Queen Eleaner and the other Lady Hunters ride up. The Queen
quickly takes in the scene ~~

QUEEN ELEANOR
Are you all right, John?

John struggles to keep his anger in check --

PRINCE JOHN
Never better, thank you, mother.

Prince John SUDDENLY DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HACKS AWAY at the
dead boar, aplattering himself with blood. He wipes his face,
sheathes his sword and RAISES UP TBE BOAR'S DECAPTTATED HEAD ~~

PRINCE JOHN
A fine trophy indeed --
(to Marian)
~~ for you, milady.

MARTIAN
That's... very kind of you, Your Grace ~~
but T couldn't, veally. The walle of my
father’s home are already crowded with
too many of its like.

PRINCE JOHN
t{helding the head out to
Tornham)
(MORE)
34,

PRINCE JOHN (cont'd)
Then you, Sir Robert -- a freshly-
butchered beast for a freshly—
appointed sheriff. What could be
more fitting?

Tornham stands there uncomfortably for a long moment, all
eyes on him ~~ then decides to “go with the flow of blood” soa
to speak, takes the head from Prince John's bloody hands,
smiles humbly and bows -~

TORNHAM
I can't think of a thing, Your
Grace.

PRINCE JOHN
Good.

(glancing at all the dead
Boars)
Now, as my mother knows well, I
always choose venison over pork ~-
so the hunt must go on!

Tornham HANDS THE SEVERED BOAR'S HEAD OVER to one of the
Royal Guards, then mounts up...

CUT TO:
EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST ~ ROYAL HUNTING LODGE -— DAY

Prince John's MERCENARIES stand guard outside a RUSTIC CABIN,
watching over the HUNTING PARTY as its honored members relax
and recover from their strenuous activity. The honored
guests are WAITED ON by SERVANTS who busy themselves ROASTING
and SERVING choice cuts of freshly killed game.

A tall, brawny KING'S FORESTER clad in leather and animal.
hides IMPALES the severed BOAR’S HEAD atop a SHARPENED STAKE.
A moment. later Prince John emerges from the Lodge, having
exchanged his blood-drenched clothes for fresh and even more
stylish garments.

John approaches the Forester, wha bows his head and steps
away, leaving Jobn to stare into the DEAD EYBS of the severed
Boar's Head. John spota Tornham in the crowd and gestures to
him. Tornham approaches...

PRINCE JOHN
Walk with me, Sheriff.

Tornham falls in beside the Prince as he makes his way
through the HUNTING CAMP, emiling and waving to his GUESTS as
he goes...
35.

PRINCE JOHN
Tell me, Sir Robert -- why do you
think you are the Sheriff of
Nottingham?

TORNHAM
(slightly confused)
Because... your brother the King
chose me.

PRINCE JOHN

Wrong.

{a beat)
God stays in heaven and the Devil
in hell and a king of England
cannot rule his kingdom from Cyprus
~~ ox Jerusalem. You are Sheriff
because I choose to let you be.
You have some reputation as an able
man of both action and intellect.
I have heard you share my own
interest in administration and law,
unlike my brother -- whose
interests, as you must know, are
limited to war and poetry. Make
yourself useful to me today, while
I rule England in his absence, and
there is no limit to what may be in
store for you tomorrow.

John gives Tornham an affectionate slap on the back, then
spots an ATTRACTIVE NOBLEWOMAN amongst the guests, turns from
Tornham and makes a bee~line to embrace her...

Tornham GLANCES AROUND, spote Marian speaking with the King’s
Forester by the impaled Boar's Bead, ‘Tornham walks over —~

TORNHAM
Remarkable shot. Did Locksley
teach you?

The King’s Forester glares at Tornham ~-

KING'S FORESTER
i taught her, sir.

MARTIAN
(introducing the Forester)
My uncle, Hugh Fitzwater -- the
King’s Forester.
36.

TORNHAM
(impressed)
Lucky for His Grace, Prince John.

KING'S FORESTER
(with concern, RE: the
gathered Royal panoply)
T hope you don’t plan on this party
lasting past sunset.

TORNHAM
I'm well aware of the security
issues involved. We shall be gone
long before then.

KING'S FORESTER
Good.

HUGH gives Tornham a curt nod of deference and marches off.

MARTAN
Archery’s not the only thing I'm
good at, Sheriff...

Tornham watches Marian stride over to where he horse is
tethered, unfasten its reins and MOUNT UP —~

MARIAN (CONT'D)
I’m also quite the horsewoman.

With thet, Marian spurs her horge and GALLOPS AWAY from the
Hunting Party, past the Royal Escorts and off into the
FOREST.

Tornham frantically MOUNTS UP on his own HORSE and GALLOPS
AFTER HER ~~

MARTAN

vides DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOODS all alone ~~ until
Tornham catches up with her...

TORNBAM
Lady Marian! T don't know what
you're doing but that’s enough of
it! We must. turn round and return
te the Hunting Lodge!

MARTAN
Must we? I know Sherwood as well
as I know my father’s house!
37.

SUDDENLY THE STAG LEAPS OUT FROM BEHIND SOME BUSHES, then
takes off at a dead run!

MARIAN
There!

Marian CHARGES her horse after the buck!

Tornham races his horse after her, trying to catch up —— but
she's got a head start and she knows these woods better than
he does, ZIGGING and ZAGGING her way through the trees,
bearing dewn on the deer ~~

Tornham starts to fall behind, only CATCHING GLIMPSES of
Marian through the thick foliage as she gallops after the
deer ~~

He CRASHES through a tangle of HEAVY BRANCHES and suddenly
reigns his horse to a stop --

Marian is gone.

TORNEHAM
Pam.

 

Tornham lets out a sigh of frustration, RIDES DEEPER INTO THE
wooDs, searching for any sign of Marian or the Hunting

Party. oe

Still nothing.

And now he's coming to the realization that he’s lost.

He reins in his horse, curses under his breath -- then cups
his hands to his lips and CALLS OUT:

TORNBAM
MARIAN!

Wo reply.
Torphem raises his HUNTING MORM to his lips to blow a signal —~
~~ but the born is sudden)y SHOT OUT OF HTS HAND BY AN ARROW!

Tornham spins his horse around in shock and surprise and goes
for his sword --

~~ but ANOTHER ARROW CLEAVES THE SADDLE-STRAP OFF THRE BELLY OF
KIS HORSE, sending him SLIDING BARD TO THE GROUND, losing his
grip on his sword as his horse NEIGHS in fright and GALLOPS OFF
into the woods!
38.

Stunned, Tornham pulls himself to his feet, searches the
ground for his sword -~ then freezes. Hears something
RUSTLING amongst the trees...

SUDDENLY a pack of HOODED and MASKED MEN in GREEN and BROWN
come LEAPING DOWN AT TORNHAM FROM OUT OF THE TREES ABOVE!

Tornham starts RUNNING through the woods, the HOODED MEN
CHASING AFTER HIM!

Tornham SPRINTS as fast as he can, suddenly skids to a halt
as ANOTHER PACK OF HOODED MEN EMERGE FROM AMIDST THE TREES IN
FRONT OF HIM, cutting off his escape!

He SPINS and TEARS OFF in yet another direction, the two
bands of Hooded Men JOINING up and CHASING AFTER him!

Tornham suddenly FALLS THROUGH THE GROUND into a DEADFALL
PIT -~ a DEEP HIDDEN HOLE covered over with broken branches
and gras¢!

The pack of Hooded Men ~- their faces CAMOUFLAGED with dry
mud and lime -- converge on the deadfall, gripping swords and
axes --

~~ SUDDENLY TORNHAM’S HAND STABS UP OUT of the pit, grabs one
of the Hooded Men by the ankle and YANKS him into the hole!

Tornham is CLINGING PRECARIOUSLY to the edge of the pit with
one hand and using the other to GRAB another startled Hooded
Man and DRAG him down into the pit also! Tornham PULLS
HIMSELF out of the hole and KNOCKS A THIRD HOODED MAN into
the pit before his remaining enemies CONVERGE on him —~

fornham is outnumbered but fights like a professional
soldier, DONGING their sword thrusts, looking for his opening
and taking it, using his hands as BRUTAL WEAPONS, breaking
NOSES, bruising THROATS, snapping WRISTS and ARMS with
violent efficiency!

Tornhan suddenly SEES something -- it’s hie horse, lese than
50 yards away, standing there, confused.

Tornham raises two fingere to his lips, WHISTLES ~~

The HORSE starts to GALLOP towards Tormham —~

Tornham POUNDS ACROSS THE FOREST FLOOR, RUNNING AS FAST AS HE
CAN towards his approaching horse, glancing back over his

shoulder to see he ig again being CHASED BY THE REMAINING
HOODED MEN}
39.

Tornham reaches his horse, LEAPS onto itas bare back, grabs
the reins, spins the animal around and RIDES AWAY from the
Hooded Men, GALLOPING OFF to safety ---

~~ just as AN ARROW SUDDENLY WHISTLES THROUGH THE AIR AND
BARELY MISSES HIM!

But the arrow wasn’t aimed at him and goes on to HIT ITS
TARGET by SLICING THROUGH A ROPE attached to some sort of
RIGGING up in the branches —~

-- which RELEASES a HUGE LOG hidden in the trees above and
SENDS IT SWINGING RIGHT FOR TORNHAM —-

-- who is KNOCKED RIGHT OFF HIS HORSE by the SWINGING LoG—
TRAP! He FLIES BACKWARDS THROUGH THE ATR and LANDS HARD on
the ground.

fornham -- barely conscious, the wind knocked out of him -~
stares up at the TREES and SPIES a Hooded Man perched on a
branch with a STRONG-BOW in his hands.

The Hocded Man looks down at the bruised and battered
Tornham, then THROWS BACK HIS HOOD ~~ revealing a strikingly
handsome FACE, lips spread in a ROGUISH SMILE:

HOODED MAN
Welcome to Sherwood.

Just before losing consciousness Tornham realizes that this
good-looking and gleeful fellow can only be one man -~

TORNHAM
(barely audible}
Locksley...

Tornham’s eyes roll up inte his head and everything GoRS
BLACK.

HOLD FOR A MOMENT.

Then the WHISTLING SOUND which we now recognize as an ARROW
piercing the air ~~

SMASH CUT TOs
CLOSE ON TORNHAM
as his eyes SNAP OPEN --— just in time to SRE the ARROW coming

straight at him -- then BARELY MISSING HIM, thudding into a
tree behind his head just inches from his face.
40.

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - DUSK

Tornham has awoken to find himself BOUND TO A MASSIVE TREE
TRUNK, arms stretched out at the shoulders, tied there like
Christ on the Cross, his entire body surrounded by the
JUTTING SHAFTS AND FEATHERED VANES OF DOZENS OF ARROWS.

THIRTY YARDS AWAY the now un-hooded Hooded Men -~ who are of
course the MERRY MEN -- are DRINKING, EATING, LAUGHING,
PLAYING DICE... and using Tornham for target practice with
their bows and arrows.

HOOD (HOODED MAN)
Good of you to join us, Sheriff.

Tornham watches tensely as ROBIN HOOD notches an arrow on hig
string, drawa the bow, aims and fires -~- sending it SOARING
STRAIGHT AT HIM!

The arrow hits dead center on its target, eliciting
UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER from the ranks of Merry Men: it has
lodged in a NARROW STRIP OF BARK visible between Tornham’s
legs, just below his crotch.

HOOD
{NOTCHING another arrow)
Lucky it's not me up there -~- my
cock would've just lost near half
its length!

The laughter DOUBLES --

MERRY MAN
That‘’s not what I heard, Robin!

HOOD
From your sister, eh?

The laughter TRIPLES as Robin Hood shoots his arrow, this
time sending it thudding into the tree just above Torpham’s |
head.

Tornham struggles against bis bonds but it’s ne use -~ he
can’t budge an inch.

HOOD
Relax, Sheriff. From the dungeon
of Sherwood there is no escape.

Bloodied, bruised and humiliated, Tornham narrows his eyes
and speaks, slowly, deliberately:
Al.

TORNHAM
I.oeo want... my... chess-set,

A confused look between Robin and his men.

HOOD
Your what?

Tornham grits his teeth, tenges
TORNHAM
My chess-set. I want my chess-set
back.
Robin Hood raises an eyebrow in disbelief —-
HOOD
Is that all you can think of at a
time like this?

TORNHAM
I_want my bloody chess-set back!

Silence ~- until beth Robin and the Merry Men ERUPT in
LAUGHTER.

Robin Hood carefully notches ANOTHER ARROW -~

HOOD
You must be quite the player.

~~ then FIRES, SPLITTING THE HAIRS ATOP TORNHAM’S HEAD.

TORNHAM
You, gix, are a brigand, thief and
murderer ~~ and I swear before God

almighty and your ragged mob that
you shall be brought to justice!

 

MORE LAUGHTER rolls from the Merry ranks. Robin Hood marches
up to Tornham and proceeds to retrieve his arrows From the
tree around the bound SherLff...

HOOD
{to his men)
He's got nerve, does he not?
(to Tornbam)
T’LL tell you about “justice, *
Sheriff: I was outlawed without
CAUSE»
(MORE)
HOOD (cont'd)
All the land T held as a loyal
tenant of the King, the land my
father held and his father before
him -- all was forfeit and taken by
Prince John, and every possession I
owned sold off and every half-penny
ef profit pocketed by that
tyrannical bastard.

TORNHAM
If you were unjustly outlawed you
should have lodged a plea in court.

HOOD
With Guy of Gisborne overseeing the
inquest? I'd sooner be tried in
hell by a jury of the damned with
Lucifer himself as Judge.

Tornham shakes his head:

TORNHAM
You were a noble. If you doubted
the fairness of the court here in
Nottingham you could have taken
your plea all the way to the King’s
Court of Justice at Westminster in
London.

For the first time since we met him a serious look fills

Robin Hood's face:

HOOD
The courts be damned. They

administer Norman justice for those
of pure Norman blood. When a lowly
Saxon such as myself --

{GESTURING to his Men}
o~- or one of my men is involved,
justice is banished from court.

MERRY MEN (VARTOUS)
Aye! -- That's no joke and right! --

 

 

42.

Tornham looks at the crowd of green and brown-clad woodsmen,

then back at their leader...

TORNBAM
So you wrap your murder and robbery
in a hloocd-soaked flag of
rebellion? Tell me -- Earl of
Locksley ~~ do you know anyone of
“pure” Norman blood? I don't.
(MORE)
TORNHAM (cont'd)
Norman and Saxon have been
enthusiastically inter-breeding
their bleed for more than a
century. You’re stuck in the past,
"Robin Hood” ~- we're all English
now.

Robin Hood glares at the Sheriff -~ then DRAWS HIS SWORD and
POINTS IT at Tornham’s THROAT -~

HOOD
Lots of Norman bleod in those veins
of yours -- eh, Sheriff?

Tornham’s eyes blaze with defiance:

TORNHAM
Go ahead. Murder a helpless
prisoner. I would expect no less
from the likes of you.

Robin Hood flashes a rather charming grin -~

HOOD
Sorry to disappoint you then...

-- and uses his sword to CUT THE ROPES binding Tornham to the
tree.

HOOD (CONT'D)

I didn’t bring you here to kill you —-
or even for the high-price in gold
you would earn in ransom. I brought
you here to tell you that though I am
indeed guilty of many things, I’m not
the murderer you seek.

(shrugging)
Now I’ve got to cover your face so
you can’t come back to kill me.
Stick te your castle of stone and
leave us to ours of bark and branch.

Tornham cubs his raw weiste, contemplates attacking Robin
ight then and there -~ but there are far too many of the
outlaw's men surrounding all around. Instead ha locks eyes
with Hoods

TORNHAM
The lew doesn’t end at the edge of
the forest.

Robin Hood’s perpetual smile disappears, replaced with a grim
intensity.
44,

A STEADY DRIZZLE starts raining down on the forest...
Robin Hood slips on his HOOD:

HOOD
Yours does.

Robin Hood nods to a HULKING WOODSMAN »- the biggest of a
rather big bunch. He steps up, COVERS Tornham's eyes with a
BLINDFOLD, takes him by the shoulders and starts leading him

away -~ but Tornham stops short ~-
TORNHAM

Robin Hood turns, pissed.

HOOD
My name is Robin Hood.

TORNHAM
(shrugging)
Whatever you call yourself...
{with an edge)
Lady Marian Fitgwater is not of
pure Saxon blood -- is she?

Robin smoulders. He calls to the Hulking Woodsman:
Koop
Little Jobn, take him back where he
belongs -- and don't hurt him on the
way ~- unless he mentions her again.

LITTLE JOHN
Done, Roh.

The pattering DRIZZLE continues as Little John takes Tornham
in his hands and LEADS BIM OFF into the woods, Robin Hood
watching them go...

CUT TOs
ERT. MANORAOUSE - NIGHT

The vain is now POURING on the grounds where the young couple
was murdered -~ also the home of Lady Marian Fitzwater.

Tornham emerges from the edge of the woods ~~ bruised, cut,
soaked and looking like hell.
The blindfold hangs around his neck and he’s in the
UNTYING his bound hands with his teeth. He marches
ENTRANCE to the house, face grim, nostrils flaring,
the door and waits...

After a few moments a thin SLOT on the heavy wooded
SLID OPEN -- revealing the aging BYES of an OLD MAN

OLD MAN (FROM BEHIND THE DOOR)
Who are you -- and what in God's
name do you want at this hour?

TORNHAM
I’m Robert Tornham, the Sheriff of
Nottingham. My apologies for the
lateness of the hour, Lord
Fitegwater, but I must insist on
seeing your daughter ~~ at once.

OLD MAN (FROM BEHIND THE DOOR)
¥You want to see my daughter...?

POUNDS on

We hear the sound of several bolts being THROWN, the door
opens a CRACK -~ then swings WIDE OPEN and the Old Man ushers

Tornham with a BEAMING SMILE:

LORD FITZWATER (OLD MAN)
Well, by all means, good sir, a
strapping noble fellow such as
yourself comes to see my Marian at
this hour, it must be a matter of
some importance! A proposal of
marriage perhaps?

Tornham smiles back at the Old Man...

INT. MARIAN'S BEDCHAMBER ~ NIGHT

Marian sits in her bed, wearing a 12th Century nightgown.
She has an open MANUSCRIPT in her lap and is JOTTING NOTES in

the MARGINS with a QUILL PEN as she READS...

Tornhan SUDDENLY THROWS OPEN the door, marches in.
quickly wraps a BLANKET over her nightgown -~

MARTAN
Sheriff? What are you doing here?
We feared you were logt or killed
or m=

TORNEAM
Betrayed.

Marien
46.

MARTIAN
T have no idea what you're ~~

TORNHAM
(in her face)
You led me into Robin Hood‘s hands
like a lamb to the slaughter.

Marian is speechless for a moment. Then regains her
composure and speaks curtly ~~

MARTAN
That‘s ridiculous. Is it my fault
that you couldn't keep up? I am
just a woman, after all.
(a beat)
Tell me, did you learn anything
during your time in the forest?

TORNHAM
Such as?

MARIAN
That Robin of Locksley is not the
killer you seek.

TORNHAM
Really? He nearly killed me.

MARTIAN
“Nearly,” Sheriff? Se you made a
heroic escape from his evil clutches?

Tornham hesitates fox an uncomfertable moment, then answers:

‘TORNHAM
Wot exactly.

MARTAN
iosee, YT take it that means if he
wanted you dead... you would be?

TORMTAM
(tight }
Ne will Live to regret passing up
the chance to kill me today. It
won't come again.

Tornkham notices for the first time that Marian’s hair is down
loose around her shoulders... then eyes the MANUSCRIPT in her
hands:
Al.

TORNHAM
What's that you're reading?

Marian narrows her eyes at Tornham, caught a bit off-guard by
his interest.

MARIAN
A new telling of "Tristan and
Isolde” by a Frenchman named
Beroul.

TORNHAM
Beroul‘’s only original contribution
to the ancient tale is to have
Tristan kill Godwin with an arrow
through the eye -- the way your
fiancee would have done it.

Marian glares at him.

MARTIAN
I haven’t gotten that far in the
story.

TORNHAM
Sorry. Didn’t mean to ruin the
ending.

Marian shrugs back at. hime

MARIAN
I believe the love triangle between
Six Tristan, Lady Isolde and her
husband the King is a metaphor for
our own spiritual struggle -~ the
choice between duty... and pasaion.

Tornham thinks on that one for a moment, then notices the
writing in the marging and steps closer to Marian ~-

TORNEAM
What's this?

MARTIAN
{self-consciously}
My notes. Alternate Lines,
commentaries, critiques of the
text. I myself write on occasion.
Poetry.
48,

TORNHAM
(impregsed)
King Richard writes poetry in his
first language -- Provencal.

MARIAN
Is it any good?

Tornham carefully weighs his answer...

TORNEAM
Passable at best. But if you tell
anyone I said it’s less than genius
I'll probably be executed for
treason.

Marian can’t help but smile:

MARTAN
So... it seems I hold your life in
my hands, Sheriff.

Tornham looks from Marian's words to her eyes. She looks
back. The silence between them grows intense -- then:

TORNHAM
My name is Robert.
{a beat)
Do you ever let anyone read your
poetry?

MARIAN
No. But you must remember, most of
the people around here can’t read.

TORNHAM
What about Locksley? Can he read?

MARTIAN
He reads my heart.

Tornham nods, thinks this over.

TORNHAM
You told me I'd be dead if he
wanted me go. I tell you he
doesn’t know what he wants -- other
than to serve his own pride.

They keep staring at each other ~-

~~ but the moment is broken by the LOUD SOUNDS OF BELLS
RINGING AND PANICKY VOLCES CRYING OUT:
49.

VOICKS (0.8.)
ALARUM! ADLARUM! ‘ALARUM!

Tornham goes to the window -- spots a GROWING CROWD in the
near distance, carrying by TORCHES and STORM-LANTERNS ~~

cur Tos
EXT. GREAT NORTH ROAD — NIGHT

Tornham marches down the road towards the RIVER TRENT and the
relatively new STONE BRIDGE which crosses it. The CROWD is
gathered at the foot of the bridge, still RINGING THEIR
HANDHELD BELLS and CALLING OUT THEIR ALARMS ~~

EXT. TRENT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Tornham reaches the CROWD ~~ it’s made up of half-a-dozen
SERFS and a few TOWNSPEOPLE...

TORNHAM
CEASE YOUR ALARM!

The Crowd turns its attention to Tornham ~~ just as SQUIRE
THOMAS and GISBORNE arrive with a force of SERGEANTS from the
Castle Garrison, all on HORSEBACK.

SQUIRE THOMAS
Six Robert?!
(DISMOUNTING and racing
over to GRAB him by the
shoulders)
You're all right!!!

Tornham nods:

TORNDAM
Alive at least,

SQUIRE THOMAS
Thank god fer that}
(WHISPERING)
I feared if you were dene for they
might promote me to Sheriff.

Gisborne dismounte and walks up to Tornham --

GISBORNE
Sheriff! This is a happy surprise.
Were you lost ~- injured ~~

captured?
TORNHAM
Later, Sir Guy.
(to the Crowd)
Who raised this Hue and Cry?

A young SERF hesitantly LIFTS HIS HAND...

SER
Begging your pardon, sir, but it
was me, sir.

TORNHAM
Were you victim of a crime?

SERF
No, sir. It was my lord and
master, sir Walter LeGriff.
(shaking)
It's horrible, sir...

TORNHAM
What's your name?

SERF
Hugo, six.

TORNHAM

Well, Hugo -- it’s now your duty to
show us what you found and tell us
what you know.

EXT. RIVERBANK ~ NIGHT

Yornham, Gisborne, Squire Thomas and the CROWD march through
the rain, STORM-LANTERNS held in their hands, all FOLLOWING
Hugo to the RIVERBANK...

HUGO
Master Walter went fishing ag usual
~~ but he's always back before
nightfall, When he dida't return T
went looking and that's when I
found...

Hugo trails off, hig hands now shaking uncontrollably...

They have reached the EDGE of the riverbank -— and the BODY.
Si.

Tornham takes a STORM-LANTERN from the CROWD and holds it
over the corpse of a well-dressed MAN in his 40's, sprawled
on his back, eyes wide open, face contorted in agony, blood
everywhere -- an ARROW jutting out of his throat.

TORNHAM
{to Squire Thomas)
Still fresh.
{to Huge)
When did you last see him alive?

SERF
After the mid-day meal but before
the church-belle sound for Vespers.

Tornham hands the storm-lantern to Squire Thomas, takes a RAG
from his pocket and carefully proceeds to PULL the arrow out
of the man’s neck. Gisborne eyes the bloody arrow:

GISBORNE
“LeGriff” -- a proud Norman name.

Tornham leoks down from the arrow to the dead man’s face -~
then scoops a few traces of BEESWAX off the man’s lifeless
cheeks, shows it to Squire Thomas:

TORNHAM
The bees have been busy.

Squire Thomas WHISPERS to Tornham:

SQUIRE THOMAS
At least you got here before they
could sell the arrow.

Tornham WRAPS the arrow in the rag, hands it to Thomas, takes
back the stoxm-lantern, looks over the body again, then
begins INSPECTING the riverbank, the lantern ILLUMINATING the
wet, shadowy area ~~

HUGO
Damn that Robin Hood. Damn him to
hell.

Torpham SEES a NET and FISHING POLE lying on the MUDDY GROUND
a few yards away from the body. He casts his light over the
trees nearby -~ revealing a large ARTERIAL SPRAY—TRAIL oF
BLOOD covering the LEAVES.

 
52.

TORNHAM
He was hit here ~~ the throat wound
sprayed his life all over the green
~- then he stumbled towards the
water...

Tornham WARROWS HIS EYES at the GROUND around their feet --
messy and covered with the SCATTERED FOOTPRINTS of the CROWD.
He then lowers the lantern to the SHOES of the vietim -~ no
mud.

Tornham is quiet for a long moment, considering. ‘Then --

TORNHAM

You’re sure it was before Vespers?
HUGO.

Yes, sir.
TORNAHM

But it didn't start raining till
just. before sundown...

Tornham stands, turns to one of the SERGEANTS --

TORNHAM (CONT ’D)
Wrap the body in burlap, take it
back to the castle.

GISBORNE
I'll see to the documents for the
Murdrum fine...

TORNHAM
Noe

GISBORNE
Tim sorry?

TORNEAM
No mardxum on this one.

GISBORNE
You're aware the law states that
whatever district is home to foul
play must be summarily fined?

TORNHAM
tt's a foolish law.
53.

GISBORNE
On the contrary -~- it deters people
from thinking they can get away
with murder.

TORNHAM
Why punish an entire community for
the act of one man? We face
special circumstances in this case.
After all -- as you, Sir Guy, will
be first to argue ~~ everyone knows
Robin Hood resides in Sherwood
forest, not in the neighborhood of
Trent Bridge.

Gisborne fumes -- but nods his head in grudging acceptance.

TORNHAM (CONT'D)

(to the CROWD)
RETURN TO YOUR HOMES! King Richard
and his government thank you for
discharging your duties as honest
subjects of the realm —- especially
you, Hugo. You have helped us down
the road to finding your lord's
murderer and bringing him to
justice.

HUGO
T hope so, sir.

The Crowd begins to disperse...
Toxrmham turns to Squire Thomas, WHISPERS:

TORNAHM
Tt wasn't Locksley,

The old man looks at the Sheriff in disbelief:

SQUIRE THOMAS
Whet? How can you be certain?

TORNHAM
(indicating the FEET of
the corpse)

Barely illuminated by the MOONLIGHT trickling in through
several expensive LEADED GLASS WINDOWS.

Tornham sleeps in a big comfortable bed -- much nicer than
the one he had in Cyprus -- but his sleep is anything but
comfortable.

He tosses and turns ~~

-- then SUDDENLY SNAPS AWAKE with a vielent start,
hyperventilating, trying to catch his breath.

He calms himself down, realizes that it’s still night.

TORNHAM

He slowly sits up naked in bed and CROSSES HIMSELF, oblivious
to the cold, his BREATH visible in the frosty air.

He suddenly SENSES something and narrows his eyes... HEARS
the faint sound of BREATHING from somewhere else in the dark
LOOMe ee

Tornham holds bis own breath for a split-second ~~

Toxrnham’s eyes suddenly GO WIDE ~-

 

QUEEN ELEANOR vises from where she has been sitting on a.
chair in the corner and approaches Tornham.. .

 

He lowers his sword and drops to his knees, bowing before her:
TORNHAM
(nervous)
Forgive me, your highness -- I
thought you were an intruder.

Eleanor smiles:

QUEEN ELEANOR
I am.

 

Tornham quickly COVERS HIMSELF with his BLANKET .

QUEEN ELEANOR
No need for modesty, Sheriff. I’ve
had two husbands and five sons.
There’s nothing on you fT haven’t
seen a thousand times before.

Tornham nevertheless pulls on some CLOTHES, then LIGHTS A
CANDLE -~

TORNHAM
This is... most unusual, your
Highness. I'm not sure what to say.

QUEEN ELEANOR
Say nothing. Use your ears

instead.

Right now less than a dozen souls
in all of England know -~ though it
will be common knowledge soon

enough.

{a beat)
A Kansom request is sure to arrive
soon -~- and just as sure to demand

the greatest sum since King David
collected all the gold of Jerusalem
to decorate the Temple of the
Israelites. Taxes are going to go
up again. Rather severely I'm
afraid. And all methods, no matter
how unpleasant, will be warranted
for use in their collection.

QUEEN ELEANOR (cont'd)
The people will hate to pay -~ but
they will love it when their money
brings their hero back to them,
covered in glory.

As for John... he will do
everything in his power to keep the
money you must raise from being
delivered to Richard's captors.

Queen Eleanor sits down on the edge of Tornham's bed.

QUEEN ELEANOR (CONT'D)

John fears he has been swallowed up
in Richard's shadow. I make a
point of remaining at John’s side
to encourage his confidence and
teach him patience. I tell him
every dog will have his day -- even
the runt of the litter.

(shaking her head)
But with news of Richard’s
capture... it will be difficult
even for me to restrain him in the
face of such a golden opportunity.

TORNHAM
Why are you telling me all this?

Eleanor leans uncomfortably close to Tornham.

QUEEN ELEANOR
Because in all of England, John's
supporters are strongest here, in
Nottingham. But you, Sir Robert,
are not among them. That is why I
worked so hard to convince John not
to interfere with your appointment.
Richard gave you thia job and
Richard is the rightful ~~ and
lawful, -- king. And a land where
the king can be overthrown is a
land where no law will be
respected. so tell me, Sheriff...
where does your duty lie?

TORNHAM
{quietly}
To Richard... and his safe return.

QUEEN ELEANOR
(nodding)
No matter what it may cost... in
gold ~- or blood.

TORNHAM
Yes.

QUEEN ELEANOR
Say it, Sheriff.

Tornham hesitates for a moment. Then -~

Queen Eleanor rises —-

QUEEN ELEANOR
Now go back to bed. And have a

What’s in it?

The Knight slams the empty cup down, wipes his sleeve across
his mouth and SHRUGS matter-of-factly:

LEAD KNIGHT
Can't say I have any idea.

Tornham UNLOCKS the Box and opens the lid. Stares inside and
furrows his brow, then reaches in and pulls out the
contents...

+..an old, somewhat rusty and blood-stained suit of CHATNMATI
ARMOR.

HERALD (0.S.)
Look upon it, good people of

BST. NOTTINGHAM - TOWN SQUARE — DAY

The CITY HERALD is in the midst of addressing a CROWD of
people who have gathered around a cross between a scarecrow
and a manneguin which hag been draped in the CHAINMATL that

sits atop the royal mannequin‘s head...

HERALD (CONT’D)
hook upon it -- for if such a grand
and mighty king could don the
humble armor ef a poor knight and
cross land and sea to reach the
burning sands of the desert and

After a moment a few brave souls from the crowd approach the
royal mannequin. One of them reaches out to touch the royal
armor -- but the Herald GRABS his hand:

HERALD
First you pay -- then you touch.

The TOWNSMAN digs into his pocket, pulls out a PENNY COIN and
drops it into a COPPER POT at the Herald's feet. The Herald
SLAPS him on the back and GESTURES for him to go ahead. The

As well as an additional 20 percent

BURNER’S WIFE
NOil! Leave him alone, you

She and her TWO SMALL CHILDREN try to help her husband, but
the other two Bailif£’s hold them back and the first Bailiff
grabs a handful of the Burner’s hair and FORCES HIS FACE
TOWARDS THE HOT COALS -~

Suddenly a HAND STABS OUT and YANKS THE BAILIFF OFF HIS
VICTIM!

The Bailiff SPINS in surprise and anger -- then freezes.

it's the Sheriff.

Burner, dark)
These things I'm forced to do. I
have no choice. It's the law. Do

Tornham reaches into a pocket, slips owt TWO SMALL GOLD CoTNS
and forces them into the Burner's hand.

The Burner looks up at him in shock and confusion.

TORNHAM

Tornham, Gisborne and several other important NOBLEMEN stand
gathered before Prince John...

PRINCE JOHN
I have it on excellent authority
that my brother is as good as dead.
In fact, by now, he may well be
dead. Not one more English coin
shall be wasted pursuing his
exorbitant ransom, If he is to
return to England it shall be as a
ghost. The ransom money that
vemaing shall be transferred to my
cormtrol.

(MORE)
63.

PRINCE JOHN (cont'd)
Furthermore, in an effort to secure
long-lasting peace with our
neighbors the French, I have
decided to marry King Phillip’s
sister, Princess Alais.

TORNHAM
But you are married, Your Grace ~~
to Countess Isabelle.

PRINCE JOHN

That union is such that it has
never found favor in God’s eyes ~~
or mine. The Archbishop has
assuced me that God wants it
annulled.

{a beat)
My brother has led England to the
very brink of ruin, largely due to
hie unbridled ambition for conquest
in France. This marriage shall end
all that. It will set the stage for
peace in our Continental territories
and prosperity here at home.

(chuckling)
it’s true, she’s quite a bit older
than I -- but the French maid is to
sit beside my throne when I hold
court, not share my bed every night.

Tornham, Gisborne and the other Nobles stand the
uncomfortably -- until Gisborne steps forward and BOWS to
Prince John, saying:

GISBORNE
Godspeed, Your Grace -~
(catching himself)
~~ forgive me... Your Majesty.

Prince Jobn smiles and the rest of the Nobles join in,
echoing Gisborne’s acknowledgement of John as their new King.
Tornham ie the last te say, “Godspeed, Your Majesty” -- but
say it he does.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SHERIFF'S OFPICR — NIGHT
Pornham is burning the midnight oi] -~ literally. LIGHT from
several. CANDLES dances eerily around the place -- revealing

the walls and floor are now covered with DIAGRAMS of MURDERED
BODIES scrawled onte large PARCHMENTS.
64.

Ternham downs a goblet of ALE, rubs his tired brow and goes
back to what he was doing -- CLEANING dried blood off ARROWS
recovered from the crime scenes...

The door OPENS and Squire Thomas enters --

SQUIRE THOMAS
You sent for me, Six?

Tornham OPENS A SECRET COMPARTMENT in his work-desk,
withdraws a small STRONG-BOX and hands it to Thomas -~ who
frowns at ite heavy weight.

SQUIRE THOMAS
Heavy.
(guessing at the value of
the contents)
Must be close to a thousand crowns
in here.

TORNHAM
Twelve-hundred and fifty. You are
to see to it that the full sum
makes ite way to Sir Hubert Walter,
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The old Squire shoots Tornham a look --

SQUIRE THOMAS
You’re forwarding our taxes to the
Church?

TORNHAM
No, Thomas -~ I'm trying to make
sure they go towards paying
Richard's ransom, rather than
preparing for John's reign. Sir
Hubert is the only one who can be
trusted,

SQUIRE THOMAS
iosee. And if we are caught?

Toxnham shoots his old Squire a look of hie own -—

TORNBAM
Then we shall suffer.

Squire Thomas considers this for a moment —
SQUIRE THOMAS

i'm happy to see you've thought
this through.
65.

~~ then heads out with the Strong-box, leaving Tornham alone.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. ARCHERY RANGE ~ DAY

A small grouping of HAY BULLS-EYE TARGET BUTTS set up on the
edge of the woods.

AN ARROW goes whistling through the air, THUDDING into the
target, just missing the bulls~eye.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that the SHOOTER is Lady Marian.

MARTIAN
Damn. Missed it by a hair.
(smiling)
Your turn.

Next to her is Tornham, a BOW in his hands also. He NOTCHES
an arrow, pulls back the bow-string -~

MARIAN (CONT'D)
Steady... smooth release... let the
bow do the work...

Tornham lets loose the shaft, the arrow sailing through the
air --

-~ and MISSING the target butt altogether -- but only by a
few inches.

Maclan stifles a laugh.

TORNHAM
Dammit.

MARTAN
Well, youfre getting closer each
lesson...

'TORNHAM

It’s been months now,

MARTAN
Maybe I’m just a bad teacher.

Tornham gives her a look, shrugs.
TORNHAM

f guess we can’t all be Robin Hood,
can we?
66,

An instant tension between them.

TORNHAM
(embarrassed)
i’mese I'm sorry, I shouldn’t have —~

MARIAN
No, it's alright, it’s ~-

TORNHAM
I don’t sleep anymore.

Marian looks at him, taken a little off-quard.

MARIAN
Really? Why not?

Tornham NOTCHES another arrow into his bow -~

TORNHAM
The list keeps growing.

MARTIAN
(quietly)
The victims? I'm sorry.

Tornham lets loose his arrow ~- another close MISS.
Tornham lowers his bow, frustrated.

TORNEAM
For what? This ig all my fault.
All the time I’ve been here I
haven‘t made one bit of difference,
My men are so busy beating every
last penny out of the population,
they've had no time to police the
eity, conduct a proper
investigation.

MARTAN
fo meant I’m sorry for you.

A look between them.

TORNHAM
Thank you.

Marian turns and diga into a SATCHEL she brought to the
archery range...
67,

MARIAN
I wanted to give you something.
It was given to me as a gift. It’s
quite beautiful and I loved it.
But then I realized... It didn't
really belong to me.

Maxian pulls out Tornhem's CHESS SET -~ the one that was
stolen when his things were hijacked by Robin Hood’s men upon
his arrival at Nottingham.

TORNHAM
(stunned)
Where... where did you get this?

Marian averts her eyes.

TORNHAM (CONT'D)
(awkwardly, figuring it
out)

of course.
{a beat)
How did you know it was mine?

MARTIAN
There‘s no Queen. I've heard the
Saracens detest women of any
authority, so it must have come
from the Crusades. And on the
bottom of the board there are some
Greek letters. I heard you were in
CYPruS;, SQ...

TORNEAM
(amiling)
You’re very smart. Maybe you
should have my job.

Marian smiles back at him, picks up her bow, notches another
ALLOW

MARTAN
How often do you play?

TORNHAM
As often as I can.

MARTAN
Do you win?

TORNHAM
All. the time.
68.

MARIAN
80 you're good?

Marian lets loose her arrow ~~ another near BULLS-EYE.

TORNHAM
Better than I am at archery, at
least.
(a beat)
Locksley... does he play?

MARTIAN
(shrugging)
He has no interest in games, books,
things of that sort. He considers
them idle pursuits of thoge lucky
enough te be blessed with wealth
and nobility at birth.

TORNHAM
That’s a little hypocritical, don't
you think? He was a Noble himself.

MARIAN
(defensively)
He’s a very complicated man.
TORNHAM
And very handsome. Dashing.
Romantic.
MARIAN

Why, Sheriff, you sound like you're
in leve with him.

TORNHAM
So romantic he gives his perpetual
fiancee the lovely gift of another
man’s prized possession.

They glare at one another.
MARTAN
(suddenly dark)
The lessons over, We'll meet again
next. week...
She begins packing up the hows and arrows, upset —-

TORNHAM
Marian, wait --

She hesitates, looks back at him.
69.

PORNHAM (CONT'D)

Now I’m the one who's sorry.
Please accept my apology. I didn't
mean to upset you.

(a beat)
ZX don't think Locksley is complicated
at all. I think he's very lucky.
But his luck is about to run out.
I'm going to catch him.

Marian narrows her eyes at Tornham ~-—

MARIAN
Oh, really?

TORNHAM
Turns out that despite being a
brigand, Hood attends Mass
regularly -~ across the river, at
Fountains Abbey. There's a friar
there named Tuck who ministers to
him and hears his confession every
other Sunday. This Sunday we'll be
waiting.

Marian tries to hide her panic.

MARIAN
How did you learn all this?

TORNHAM
(sbrugging)
People talk.

MARTAN
Especially if they are being
tortured.

TORNHAM
More often if they are being given
enough food er coin to survive.

MARIAN
Blood money.

TORNBAM
Charity.

Marian glares at Tornham with contempt... and a hint of
sadness. She turns her back on him and walks away.
Tornham stands there at the archery range, alone.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. MANORHOUSE — NIGHT
Quiet. A pale mist swirls through the thick night air. A
small CANDLELIGHT suddenly glows from within the walls of the
house. The heavy oak doors creak and slowly OPEN...
Marian steps out, the glow coming from a LANTERN held in her
hand. She carefully closes the door behind her and
cautiously creeps out into the darkness.

FROM THE BUSHES

Someone watches as Lady Marian leaves the grounds of her
manoz and moves into the WOODS...

It‘s Tornham.

He carries his own amall lantern, one gloved hand cupping it,
80 as not to let too much light trickle out -~-

~- but then he decides the risk of being seen is too great

and he blows out the flame, plunging himself into blackness

as he stealthily FOLLOWS Marian into the shadowy treeline...
DISSOLVE TO:

BST. SHERWOOD FOREST ~ NIGHT

Shafts of pale moonlight plunge down from between the flora

and fauna, Marian moves through the pitch-black woods almost

effortlessly, the small glow from the lantern illuminating

her path -- a path she’s clearly taken many times before.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - NIGHT

Silent, peaceful and dark, the dim embere of a DYING CAMPFIRE
mixing with the moonlight to provide the only light.

Marian slowly emerges from the shadowy fauna ~—

~- when she is suddenly SURROUNDED by a TRIO of HooD’S
SENTRYS who drop out of the trees around her, swords at the
ready --

SENTRY #1
Miss Marian --?
Ti.

SENTRY #2
(bowing his head
apologetically)
Pardon, Miss, the moon is at half-—
size n’ no one told us you were
coming.

MARTIAN
I need to see Robin.

The two Sentry’s exchange an uncomfortable look.
SENTRY #1
Of course, Milady, I'll rouse him
right away.
cur TOs
INT. TREE-TENT - NIGHT

A ramshackle dwelling made of animal skins, leaves and twigs.

Robin Hood lies fast asleep, a half-empty deerskin flask
lying next to him, ale leaking out.

Also next to him is a barely-clothed WENCH, attractive, but
SNORING loudly.

Little Jobn sticks his head inside, POKES Robin violently --

LITTLE JOHN
Rob ~~ Rob, wake up!

Boob
Christ, John...

LITTLE JOHN
Marian’s here.

Robin's sleep-encrusted eyes suddenly FOCUS and he hurriedly
starts shaking the snoring woman next to him ~~

WENCH

(groggy)
Jaezus, Rob, haven't va’ had
enough, lad? Fer fuck’s sake -~

HOOD
You’ve got te get out of here, now.

CUT TO:
72,

EXT. TREE-TENT ~ NIGHT

Robin, half-clothed, pulls himself from inside the
camouflaged tent, spots Marian approaching in the distance,
led by one of the Sentries with a TORCH.

Robin WAVES to her, begins lowering himself down a rope &
vine LADDER at the front of the tree, while --

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE

-- the Wench, still half-naked, climbs down a REAR ESCAPE
HATCH, reaches the ground and quickly scurries off inte the
woods under cover of the glowing moon.

EXT. OUTLAW CAMP ~ NIGHT
Robin greets Marian with a HUG, stifling a yawn --

HOOD
Heavens, Marian, it's lovely to see
you, but my men could have killed
you, sneaking inte the woods at
this time o’ night!

MARTIAN
I’m sorry, Rob, but I had to warn
you. The Sheriff knows about
Fountain Abbey. You cannot go this
Sunday, you cannot --

SUDDENLY A PIECING FEMALE SCREAM rips through the aight air.
The half-naked Wench comes TEARING through the woods --

WENCH
Alarum -~ ALARUM!

Merry Men starts WAKING, LEAPING out of the dirt & grass
beds, grabbing weapons, what the bell is happening -~- ?

Marian shoote the panicked Wench a look, starts to say
something to Robin, when —~

fornham steps out of the woods.

TORNSAM
(RB: the Wench)
She’s a bit high-strung, that one.

Tornham fine himself instantly surrounded by SWORD-POINTS and
drawn BOWS & ARROWS ~~
73.

Robin glares at Marian in disbelief ~~

HOOD
Christ, Marian, do you realize what
you've done?!! You've he

Sheriff of goddamned Nottingham TO

OUR CAMPSITE!
Marian just glares past Robin ta the half-clad Wench ~~

MARIAN
(tight, under her breath)
Who the hell is she?

Robin shute his eyes tight -~ the entire night has gone to
shit in minutes,

TORNHAM
I assure you, I’m here alone and I ~-

HOOD
SHUT UP!
(taking a deep breath,
then shrugging to his
men)
Kill him.

Marian's eyes go wide ~~

MARTAN
WAIT!

The Merry Men hesitate ~~

MARIAN
{to Robin)
Shouldn‘’t you at least find out why
he’s here?

HOOD
Are you mad? He's here to arrest
me, to arxest us all!

TORNHAM
That's not true, actually.

LITTLE JOHN
(pressing his sword-point
into Ternham's THROAT)
He said shut it.

TORNHAM
i’m here because ~~
74.

LITTLE JOHN
SHUT IT!

TORNHAM
~~ I_need your help!

Little John lets out a SNARL of anger and rears back to STAB
TORNHAM IN THE NECK ~~

~~ but Robin shoots out a hand and stops John in mid-thrust:

HOOD
And why, pray tell, should I help
you?
TORNHAM
Because you would help yourself as
well.
{a beat)

I believe you did not murder those
people. But I'm the only one who
does. Help me... and perhaps I can
change all that.

Robin narrows his eyes at the Sheriff, gets in his face.

HOOD
And why would you care what happens
to me?

Tornham glares back at Hoods

TORNHAM
ZT don't. But I do care about
finding the truth.

A tense moment between them ~~ then Robin gestures to his men
and the Sheriff is released.

HOOD
EAL talk with you -- byt only
after IT see to my Marian. If it’s
a choice between clearing my name
of murder and spending a moment
witb her, I choose her.

Marian shifts her eyes from the out-of-breath Wench to Robin
Hood —~

MARTIAN
Not tonight you don't.
-- then turns on her heel and marches off.

COT TOs
EXT. OUTLAW CAMP - CAMPFIRE ~— NIGHT

Tornham and Robin sit around the fire, edgy and nervous MERRY
MEN STANDING GUARD nearby, shooting the Sheriff dirty looke.

Robin stares acrosa the fire to where MARTIAN sits in the
distance, TENDING TO THE SICK AND WOUNDED in the ranks of his
Merry Men.

Tornham unwraps something covered in oij-cloth...

TORNHAM
I've been collecting these since I
came to Nottingham. Used a
tincture of vinegar and thyme to
clean off the blood...

Tornham hands Robin a collection of ARROWHEADS...

HOOD
(defensively)
These aren't mine, I can tell you
that.
TORNHAM

There’s a symbol that’s etched on
each one. Can you see it...?

Robin inspects a couple of the arrowheads, narrows his eyes —~
CLOSE ON THE ARROWHEADS

Two LETTERS crossed together an ornate “S* and a decorative
ape * .

HOOD
Well, thare’s the proof, isn’t it?
S.P. The killer's initials.

TORNHAM
Yes, well, that would be too easy,
wouldn't 2t? I've checked baptism
records for all of Nottingham
county. Those initials don’t match
anyone who could be the killer ~~ a
few children, a few old and infirm
villagers. Motive to hate the
Royals pexhaps but not the ability
to murder them.

(MORE)
76.

TORNHAM (cont'd)
These were longbow killings. It
takes strength and accuracy to kill
someone that way. So, I’m stumped.
And since you are the expert archer
in these parts, I thought maybe --

HOOD
(cutting him off)
You married, Sheriff?

Tornham watches, confused, as Robin takes a swig of ALE.

TORNHAM
No. ‘Fraid not. Guess T haven't
met the right woman. Why?

Robin turns his gaze from the arrowheads to Marian, who
continues tending to his men...

HOOD
Thought. maybe an educated man such
as yourself could give ma advice,
that’s all.

TORNHAM
On the fairer sex? You seem to be
doing fine where that’s concerned.

HOOD
Oh, you mean the girl with the
piercing scream? Jenny?

TORNHAM
I believe she said her name was
Matilda.

HOOD

(genuinely surprised)
Really? I coulda’ swore it was
Jenny. Ob, well.

(quietly)
it's hard you know. Living with a
bunch of brigands in the woods. The
women from all over Nottingham...
serfs, towngtolk ~~ even some
noblewomen -- I'm a hero to ‘em all.
Don't get me wrong -- I love Marian
more than life itself but... well...
she’s a cultured beauty. Sherwood ig
no place for her.

{a beat)
Do you think she’ll forgive me?

Tornham shrugs and shoots Hood a look -~
77.

TORNHAM
Why not? After all, you are a
“hero.”

Hood smiles, takes another swig of ale and CLAPS Tornham on
the back —-—

HOOD
Thanks for understanding, Sheriff -—
men~to-man
Yornham glares at Hood ~~

TORNHAM
I was being sarcastic.

Robin glares back at Tornham -~

HOOD
I could still kill you, ya’ know?
(a beat)

But Marian would not approve. And
that’s all I want from her
really... approval.

Robin finishes off his ale, tosses the empty flask across the
campsite, goes quiet.

TORNEAM
You're drunk. And thig was a waste
of my time.

tornham rises to his feet and goes to RETRIEVE the arrows -—
but Robin pulls them away.

HOOD
(suddenly, bitter)
Think you’re se damn smart, don’t
you “Sheriff?

Tornham stops, turns back to Robin.
HOOD (CONT ’D)
(fingering the arrowheads)
Sagitarii Pedestri.

TORNHAM
Excuse me?

HOOD
S. P, is Sagitarii Pedestri -~-
718.

TORNHAM.
(translating)
“Foot Archer"?

HOOD

(nodding)
Good King Henry had the Latin
scrawled on supplies for the
infantry archers before his
invasion of Ireland. To keep track
of the pennies and the pounds ~~
arrows cost money, you know. Your
bey Prince John led that one.

(displaying the

arrowheads )
These were made for John’s men.

TORNHAM
Are you sure about this?

Robin pins the Sheriff with his eyes, then shrugs.

HOOD
Maybe. You said it yourself ~~ I’m
drunk.

Suddenly a SOUND pierces the night air -- GALLOPING HORSES!

Robin stumbles to his feet just as SIR GUY OF GISBORNE AND AW
ENTIRE SQUAD OF HIS SOLDIERS BRUPT FROM THE WOODS OWN
HORSEBACK, §U! UNDING THE OUTLAW CAMP!

Merry Men leap for their UNSTRUNG BOWS and ARROWS, but are
CUT DOWN by the swords of the mounted soldiers ~~

Robin glares at Tornham across the fire --

HOOD
Bastard! YOU BETRAYED Us!

Roblin ATTACKS Tornbam, but befere the Sherwood bandit can
xeach the startled Sheriff, TWO SOLDERS CHARGE THEIR HORSES
between the two men, TRAPPING ROBIN --

GISBORNE
{yelling to his men)
Take Hood alive -~ anyone else,
feel free to kill!

Robin turns his attention to evading his captors, ROLLING
UNDER THETR HORSES, and clambering into a one of the TREES of
the campsite -~
79,

In the panicked firelight, Marian CHARGES at Tornham -~

MARIAN
I trusted youl!

Tornham suddenly SEES something, grabs Marian by the wrists
and PULLS HER OUT OF THE WAY OF A CHARGING HORSE -- up in the
saddle sits Gisborne.

Sir Guy nods down to the Sheriff -~-

GISBORNE
Many thanks, Sheriff. The plan
worked beautifully.

TORNHAM
at plan? How did you find me?

GISBORNE
Your silver-haired Squire alerted
me that you were planning to follow
Lady Marian to Hood. Well done,
Sheriff.

Gisborne rides off, BARKING ORDERS to his men...
Tornham looks back at Marian -~
TORNHAM

Marian. Please ~~ you must believe

me, I knew nothing of this.
Marian ig about to reply when her attention is drawn to the
SCREAMS of Robin being BEATEN AND DRAGGED ACROSS THE CAMPSITE
BY GISBORNE'’S SOLDIERS -~

HOOD
Maciani MARTIAN!

Marian tries te race to Rebin's side but Tornham holds her
back as the owtlaw is BOUND and GAGGED by the soldiers —~

MARTIAN
(SLAPPING at Tornbam)
Let go of me, LET GO, T HATE You, T
HATE YOU!
Tornham just takes it as Marian keeps screaming.
But we can see that he's breaking inside.

EXT. ENGLISH COASTLINE - DAWN

A group of PRINCE JOHN’S SERGEANTS serving as LOOK-OUTS are
rustling themselves up from sleep, changing SHIFTS, one of
them wiping sleep from his eyes. The sleepy Look-Out
stumbles over to the side of a cliff overlooking the mist-
shrouded ocean and starts PISSING over the edge...

SUDDENLY a BARRAGE OF ARROWS comes whistling out of the
distant mist, IMPALING the Look-Out, killing him instantly.

The sleepy Look-Out topples over the side of the cliff and the
other Lock-Outes suddenly panic and grab for their weapons ~~

~- but ANOTHER BARRAGE of ARROWS comes sailing out of the
mist, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER --

Until all of Prince John's Leok-Outs are dead.

A moment of eerie silence -- just the sounds of waves lapping
against the coast line.

Then a large SHAPE starts to emerge from the mist...
A SHIP -- and at the fore of the ship ig a carved and
colorfully-painted FIGUREHEAD -- depicting a FEROCIOUS,
ROARING LION...

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE ~- GREAT HALL ~ NIGHT

A HUGE PARTY is going, ROYALS DANCING and making merry,
EATING and DRINKING like pigs, Prince John and Guy of
Gisborne chief amongst the merry-makers.

Tornham is there, also drinking heavily, not in celebration,
but in misery. He watches as Prince John holds up an EMPTY
GOBLET and Gisborne steps up and FILLS IT from a large JUG OF
WINE. os

The “spectacle” course is served, LARGE PIES being laid out
on the tables, carefully sliced open —-- and LIVE BLACKBIRDS
INSTANTLY FLYING OUT OF THE SLICED CRUST, flapping up and
fluttering around at the top of the high ceiling...

Prince John approaches the Sheriff, a large overflowing
goblet. of wine in one hand, a huge leg of lamb in the other ~~

PRINCE JOHN
Nice work, Sheriff. How does the
pest of Chief Justiciar of the
realm sound?

TORNHAM
ioam... flattered, Your Highness.

PRINCE JOHN
As weil you should be.
(a beat)
Say, where is that fine young
Fitzwater wench? I know she was
invited.

TORNHAM
Why ask me, Your Highness? The
Lady Marian’s thoughts and actions
are her own.
82.

Prince John tears a piece of meat off bis lamp shank and
chews, grinning -—-

PRINCE JOHN

Oh, don’t be coy, Sheriff. I’ve
seen the way you look at the woman.

{a sly smile)
The first time is always the best --
particularly when it's against her
will. You know, once Hood is
executed, your path to her bed will
be free of obstruction. And
there's no way old Man Fitawater
would turn down a proposal from the
kingdom's next Chief Justiciar, eh?

Tornham looks at Prince John, a thousand things running
through his head. Then ~~

TORNHAM
Your Highness, the execution you
speak of must be preceded by a
trial. Trial by Jury is the only
way to establish a clear and honest
record. Hood is very popular here
in Nottingham. But if he is proven
guilty of these murders on the
strength of the evidence, no one
will mourn his death. If we
execute him without benefit of
trial we run the risk of creating a
martyr for those you spoke of ~~
the ones waiting to raise the
bloedy flag of rebellion against
you.

Prince Jehn stares at Tornham for a moment -~ then shakes
his head -~

PRINCE JOHN
X see your point, Sheriff -- but
trials are notoriously uncertain
proceedings. I have no desire to
place such a sensitive matter in
the hands of a “jury.”

Tornham takes a frustrated drink, thinks hard for a moment...
and gets an idea.

INT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - DUNGEON ~ NIGHT

Robin Hood hangs there, CHAINED TO THE WALL, covered in blood
and bruises.

He looks up at the sound of his door being UNLOCKED ~—

Tornham nods to a DUNGEON GUARD, who escorts the Sheriff
inside, then SHUTS the door behind him, leaving Robin and
Tornham alone together.

HOOD
(with contempt)
come to gloat?

TORNHAM
Whether you believe it or not, the
truth is I had nothing to do with
Gisborne’s attack. He surprised me
the same as you.

Hood scowls at Tornham ~~

HOOD
“The same"?! Look around, Sheriff —-
it’s not the same.

TORNHAM
I know... and I'm sorry for that,
Which is why I’ve come,
(a beat)
I've convinced Prince John to give
you a Trial.

Hood digests this news... that doesn’t sound too bad.

HOOD
(nedding his head, trying
to stay positive...)
So T need to find a lawyer, eh?
I've heard Stephen Glanvill is
quite the advocate. What do you
think of him?

TORNHAM
It's not going to be that kind of
trial.

HOOD

(furrewing his brew)
What doe you mean?
84.

TORNHAM
Prince John would only agree to a
Trial by Combat.

Hood narrows bis eyes at Tornham -~

HOOD
Who with?

Tornham hesitates...

HOOD (CONT’D)
Not Gisborne?

Tornham shrugs «

TORNHAM
He is the Prince’s most loyal and
able retainer.

HOOD
Weapons?

TORNHAM
The usual for close-quarters.
Broadsword. Battle Axe. Mace.

Rebin just glares at Tornham in disbelief ~-

HOOD
Oh, that’s great. That’s just
fucking great...

TORNAHM
Listen, it is a miracle that I was
even able to -~

HOOD

(cutting him off)
Gisborne’s one of the fiercest,
most bloodthirsty swordsman in all
of England, do you understand that?

drawn-out agony added for good

tornham is silent for a moment. Then ~~

TORNHAM
Rest as best you can. The Trial is
set for the morning. I‘1l see what
I can do about getting you some
better food tonight.

Tornham turns, knocks on the dungeon door and waits for the
Guard to arrive...

INT/EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE -— ARMORY ~ NIGHT

The storeroom for the castle's weapons, sited between the
GARRISON BARRACKS and the BLACKSMITH’S SHOP. By LAMP and
TORCHLIGHT, Gisborne is testing the sharpness of his SWORD
and AXE blades and the balance of the weight of his MACE.

Toxrnham enters, approaches sir Guy.

GISBORNE
(eyes still glued to his
weapons )
Sheriff. What brings you away from
the festivities?

TORNHAM
T’m here to ask a favor.

Gisborne looks up from his weapons, furrows his brow —

GISBORNE
And what. could that be?

TORNHAM

Locksley.

{a beat)
Don’t kill him tomorrow. It’s not
vequired by atatute. Put him down
and let him yield. We will have
been judged guilty by God but the
final disposition of his sentence
will fall back on the city’s court,
which will allow me time to gather
more evidence.
86.

Gisborne stares at Tornham.

GISBORNE
And what need is there of any more
evidence? Do you doubt his guilt?

Tornham hesitates for a moment, then:

TORNHAM
T want to prove the case beyond
doubt. The man is a hero to many
in this city. Better his guilt be
unquestioned.

Gisborne's eyes fall back on his weapons.

GISBORNE
TE I defeat him tomorrow it will be
beyond dispute that he is guilty, and
considering the nature and extent of
his bloody crimes I find it difficult
to believe even Prince John's enemies
would hesitate to see a sentence of
death carried out.

Gisborne tightens his grip on the sword he has been
SHARPENING.

GISBORNE (CONT‘D)
Besides ~~ John wants that criminal
punished, Not just brought to
justice -- but brought to blood.
And John knows I am the man to do
it. Always have been, always will.

Tornham studies Gisborne, then shifts his eyes to where
Gisborne’s freshly-cleaned SURCOAT sits hanging in
preparation for tomorrow's combat. Instead of Gisborne’s
usual family coat-of-arms, it bears a ROYAL BADGE OF OFFICE:
THREE GOLDEN CUPS UPON A BLOOD-RED FIELD.

TORNHAM (CONT’D)
I saw you pouring John the
ceremonial first cup of wine
tonight. How did you earn the
honor of being his Chief Butler?

GISBORNE
Exemplary service in battle ~~
during the Campaign of eighty-five.

Tornham’s eyes narrow.
, TORNHAM
John’s Irish campaign?

Gisborne smiles at the memory and nods his head ~~

GISBORNE

And what a campaign it was.

(a beat)
I'll tell you that story some other
time, Sheriff, For now... instead
of riding into battle tomorrow, as
would be my preference as a master
of horse, I'll fight your woodsman
on foot. I won't let him live...
but I'll give him the ghost of a
chance to take my life, instead of
Losing his.

(smiling again)
It will make it more interesting.

Tornham stares at Gisborne, trying to figure something out...
Takes one last look at Gisborne‘s face lit by the flickering
torchlight, turne and walks away...

Tornham sits at hie desk, inspecting the ARROWHEADS by

enters --

SQUIRE THOMAS
Perhaps it is not my place, but you
should have been asleep hours ago.
You have to officiate at the trial,
which will be right after daybreak.

TORNHAM
Tm afvaid the officiating shall be

be ill from too much debauchery at
tonight's celebration. Be sure and
relay my apologies to the Prince,

Tornham sets aside the arrowheads in fruetration ~-

TORNEAM (CONT D)
Tell me something, Thomas -- why in
God‘s name did you tell Gisborne
where I was going? Why?

Squire Thomas sighs, sits down across from Tornham and shrugs
his weary shoulders...

SQUIRE THOMAS
You were marching into a den of
outlaws in the middle of the

Tornham locks eyes with the old man... then nods.

WOODEN BARRIERS have been used to CORDON OFF the center of

CITY FOLK of all ages and classes begin to arrive and find
seats, while VENDORS start loudly HAWKING bread, fruit, nuts

Gisborne walks out of his Tower and LOCKS THE DOOR behind

his back, GREAT HELM cradled in the crook of one arm.
Waiting for him are several of his SOLDIERS, who rise to
attention and stare suitably impressed at the splendidly
lethal looking figure which he cute.

Gisborne glances at the GROWING CROWD as it OVERFLOWS the
benches, smiles to himself and marches of f to the center of
the courtyard, his Soldiers following in his wake...

+a few moments later, Tornham steps out from behind a
nearby stairwell and quickly but cautiously approaches the
heavy oak DOOR at. the base of the Nexth Tower. It is locked
from within.

Tornham casts a quick glance over his shoulder to make sure
he‘s not being watched, then digs into a pocket, pulle out a
thin, IRON ROD, inserts it in the KEYHOLE and begins PICKING
THE LOCK...

After several long moments of struggle, the Sheriff manages
to unbolt the LOCK ~-- then slowly opens the door and creeps
inside...

Int. NORTH TOWER - GISBORNE‘S CHAMBERS ~ DAWN

The Sheriff entere the opulently furnished space -- quite a
contrast to his own modest dwellings -- and proceeds to look
around.

He searches a CABINET, a rack of ugly-looking EDGED WEAPONS ~~
nothing. Searches Gisborne's BED, the pockets in GISBORNE’S
CLOTHES -- still nothing.

Tornham shivers in the COLD -~ then glances over at the
FIREPLACE. « «

Something is wrong.
There are no ashes or wood.

TORNHAM
(to himself)
No need to warm your ass on a cold
morning, Sir Guy...?

Tornham inspects the fireplace. Looks up the CHIMNEY, sweeps
his hand inside, pulls it out. Still clean.

TORNHAM (CONT ’D)
And no soot.

Tornham pushes hia hand against the back WALL of the
fireplace, moves his hand from STONE to STONE, pushing,
probing ~~ suddenly one of the stones MOVES INWARD, tripping
a mechaniam -—- there‘s &@ CREAKING NOISE and a section of the
rear wall OPENS...

Revealing a HIDDEN PASSAGEWAY beyond.

Tornham narrows his eyes, adjusting them to the darkness ~~
makes out a WOODEN STAIRCASE leading down into the shadows.

The Sheriff locks around, finds a small OTL LAMP next to
Gisborne's bed, lights it with a flint and head down into the
darkness...

A signal is given and with a FLOURISH the KETTLEDRUMS go

A HERALD steps forwards

The CROWD replies with a modicum of enthusiasm --

notices the empty seat and turns to his CHAMBERLAIN:

Tornham staggers backwards, catches himself, leans against

He takes a deep breath and continues to search the room,
comes across a SCROLL rolled out on a rotting wood table. He
casts the light from his lantern over the scroll --

Tt is a LIST of NAMES, with some of the names CROSSED out

The names of the MURDER VICTIMS -- a degth-list.

Tornham steadies a shaking head, sets down his lantern and
carefully ROLLS UP the seroll, placing it in hig jerkin.

As he turns to leave the way he came he suddenly spots a
xotting and mildewed BANNER hanging on the wall with a JEWISH

Tornham waves his lantern around again, sees a BOARDED-UP

INT. TUNNEL

The shadowy mudhole leading from Gisborne's chambers inside
Nottingham Castle to his hidden sanctorum in the Jewish

Only now it's FILLED with men ~~ KING RICHARD‘S ARMY,

Tornham. .»

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE ~- WORTH TOWER ~ DAY

A few of Prince John’s Soldiers are re-loading their
CROSSBOWS while others sharpen their SWORDS...

Suddenly the DOORS of the North Tower BURST OPEN, KING
RICHARD'S ARMY POURING FORTH from inside, instantly KILLING
the surprised Soldiers and CHARGING out into NOTTINGHAM
CASTLE!

CAPTAIN
For the rightful ruler of England --~
RICHARD THE LIONHEARTED -~ ATTACKI!!

Richard's Army SPILLS FROM THE GUTS OF THE TOWER, viciously
cutting down Prince John’s men where they stand!

EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE -— COURTYARD - DAY

Gisborne and Prince John HEAR the SCREAMS and SOUNDS of
BATTLE coming £rom within the Castle walls ~~

PRINCE JOHN
This is impossible...

~~ then they SEE RICHARD‘’S ARMY as it begins streaming into
the courtyard from within, LAYING WASTE to John’s men, taking
them totally off-quard!

Gisborne SPOTS Tornham amidst the chaos ~~ fighting ALONGSTDE
Richard’s Men, helping to DEFEAT Prince John’s soldiers -~

GISBORNE
Son of a bitch...

PRINCE JORN
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?!

Gisborne shoves past the panicked John and LEAPS into the
fray, CLEAVING SKULLS right and left with his swerd to reach
the Sheriff -~
106.

But the Sheriff is doing the same thing, his sword drawn and
flailing through the battle, trying to reach Gisborne ~~

CLANGG! IES

THETR SWORDS VIOLENTLY CROSS, both men glaring at each other
with hate --

GISBORNE,
Traitor!

TORNBAM
Prince John is the traitor -~ and
you are the murderer,

Z found your little hiding place,
Sir Guy. I found your arrows, you
sick monster.

Gisborne's eyes go wide for a second, then he takes a vicious
SWIPE at Tornham's head with his sword -~

Tornham manages to DUCK just in time, but Guy rears back to
strike again -—

~~ but he is KNOCKED BACKWARDS by a GALLOPING HORSE as one of
Prince John’s men attempts to FLEE the battle!

Gisborne SPINS to SEE that Richard's men are UNLOCKING the

GATB to the castle, MORE and MORE of Richard’s Army now

POURING INTO THE COURTYARD!

Gisborne suddenly TAKES OFF RUNNING through the chaos ~-—
Tornham LEAPS to his feet, SPOTS what Gishorne is heading for --
Gisborne reaches a man on HORSEBACK, violently TEARS the man
from his horse and JUMPS on top of it, begins GALLOPING his

way through the battle, trying desperately to reach the main
gates and fxeedom ~~

ROBIN HOOD

Suddenly appears across the courtyard, grabs up a BOW &
ARROW, AIMS for GISBORNE!

GISBORNE
SEES Robin aiming for him, suddenly JERKS hie horse around,

GRABS inte the crowd of SCREAMING, FIGHTING and CHEERING
people and comes up with LADY MARIAN!
107.

TORNHAM
SEES this from across the melee, YELLS -~

TORNBAM
MARTANL 1!

Sir Guy uses the struggling Marian as a HUMAN SHTELD, so that
Hood doesn’t have a clear shot, and powers his horse towards
the gate -—

Hood RACES after Gisborne, but is cut off by the PIGHTING --
Suddenly someone BLOCKS Gisborne's path ~~
It's old Squire Thomas, brandishing a spear -~

Gisborne lets out a HOWL of FURY, ducks Squire Thomas's SPEAR
THRUST and TRAMPLES THE OLD MAN WITH HIS FRENZIED HORSE, then
CHARGES through the Gatehouse and out of the castle...

Tornham FIGHTS his way through the chaos and reaches Thomas's
side ~~

TORNHAM
Thomas! My god, Thomas, what were
you thinking?

SQUIRE THOMAS
(weakly)
I tried to stop him... I tried...

TORNHAM
(fighting back tears)
Look what he’s done to you, Thomas.
Look what he’s done.

Thomas pulls Tornham close, WHISPERS in his ear --
SQUIRE THOMAS
I’m sorry, Robert... I wanted to
make for being... over-protective.
Tt seems you will have to look
after yourself from now on.
Squire Thomas dies.

Tornham lets out a SCREAM of RAGE, GRABS a nearby riderless
HORSE, climba on and GALLOPS AFTER GISBORNE...

SHERIFF TORNHAM

Galloping his horse out of the city gates, in hot pursuit of
Gisborne...

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF NOTTINGHAM ~ DAY

Tornham gallops on down the ROAD, approaching the edge of
SHERWOOD FOREST. He suddenly SPIES Marian‘’s body lying
splayed out, face-down and motionless in the muddy road.

Tornham’s face fills with panic. He draws his horse to a
stop, leaps down, races to her side and gently rolls her
OVEL ere

Her features are splattered with blood and dirt. She looks
lifeless...

TORNHAM
Marian...?

+e oumtil her eyes flutter open. She stares up at the Sheriff
and manages a slight smile ~~

MARIAN
(weakly)
Not who I was expecting as my
rescuer ~- but youfll do.

TORNBAM
Are you all xight? Did he burt
you, did he -- ?

Marian silences him with a finger to his lips.

MARIAN
He threw me off his horse. But
T°li live.

He rode into Sherwood.

They lock eyes for a long moment.

Then Tornham tenderly wipes blood and mud from Marian‘'s face
and KISSES her.

She does nothing at first -- then she returns the kiss, tears
starting to form in her eyes.

Tornham pulls away from her, steeling himself for what is to
COME «

TORNBAM
(hard)

Take the horse. Go back to

Locksley.
Tornham rises from Marian’s side and heads for the trees.
Marian watches bim go. For a moment it looks like she is
about to call for him to stop and come back to her ~~ but the
moment. passes and she says nothing.

EXT. ROYAL HUNTING LODGE - DAY

The King's Forester STANDS GUARD at the entrance to the
rustic structure.

GISBORNE SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE TREES ON HORSEBACK AND
STRIKES DOWN THE GUARD WITH A SLASH FROM HIS SWORD!

Gisborne jumps down off of his horse, GRABS the Forester's
BATTLE-~AXE and uses it. to CLEAVE OFF THE LOCK on the door to
the lodge.

He KICKS OPEN the door, stares inside at the array of HUNTING
BOWS and ARROWS lining the walls...

He suddenly hears a FAMILIAR VOICE crying from somewhere else
in the forest ~~

TORNHAM (0.8.)
GISBORNE!

CUR TO;
TORNHAM

Sword out, pushing his way through the sun-dappled trees and
bushes, grim detexmination carved into his features ~-

Suddenly he HEARS ~~
110,

GISBORNE (0.9.)
Just like the Royal Hunting Party,
eh, Sheriff?

Tornhan narrows his eyes, grips his sword —-

A razor-sharp ARROW SUDDENLY comes WHIZZING AT HIM FROM OUT
OF THE TREES, just missing his head, imbedding in a tree
behind him!

Torcnham cringes in pain, feels BLOOD on his EAR where the
arrow WICKED him.

Tornham CHARGES his way into a tangle of heavy branches,
DIVES to the ground, barely EVADING ANOTHER ARROW which sails
just over his head!

GISBORNE (0.8.)
How does it feel being the Stag,
Tornhan? Maybe I'll skin your
corpse, cook it up and eat it when
this ig all over, God knows I did
worse in Ireland.

Tornham SEES something through the trees, CATCHES a GLIMPSE
of GISBORNE'S HORSE between shards of thick foliage, ducks
down and tries to quietly outflank him...

Tornham cautiously makes his way through the brush, sweat
starting to stain his brow, more blood leaking from his
clipped ear...

He tightens hie grip on his swoxd as he CATCHES ANOTHER
GLIMPSE of Gisborne’s Horse through the trees, close now...

Tornham steadies himself, then LEAPS OUT OF THE BRUSH,
ATTACKING GISBORNE FROM BEHIND with a ferocious WAR CRY --

But the horse is riderless.
Gisberne is gone.
Tornham hesitates for a moment ~~

Then one of GISBORWE'S ARROWS comes tearing through the air,
IMPALING Yornhem in the leg.

Tornham SCREAMS in agony and goes down.

GISBORNE (0.8. )
Remember when I told you I knew
nothing about the longbow, Sheriff?
I_lied.
al.

Tornham whips up his sword JUST IN TIME TO BLOCK ANOTHER
ARROW from Gisborne, the arrow RICOCHETING OFF the blade with
a spray of SPARKS.

Tornham frantically pulls himself to his feet and desperately
CRASHES through the trees, LIMPING, trying to escape, ARROWS
tearing through the aix around him —

Tornham keeps cunning for all he's worth -- then catches a
GLIMPSE of a Stag ~~ perhaps the very same one from the Royal
Hunt all those months ago. ‘The noble animal silently watches
hid. «+

For one bare moment their eyes meet -- and the terror in
Tornham’s eyes shows he is now the one being hunted.

ANOTHER ARROW imbeds itself into Tornham’s SHOULDER and he
SCREAMS again, losing his grip on his sword.

He tries to reclaim hie blade but ANOTHER ARROW splits the
ground, just missing his fingers, cutting him off from the
sword.

Tornham, blood leaking from his shouldex and his leg, turns
and painfully continues to RACE across the ground of the
forest, weaponless -~-

EXT. ROYAL HUNTING LODGE ~ DAY

Tornham burst out of the trees, SEES the hunting lodge and
charges towards it —-

-- then TRIPS and stumbles over the brush-covered CORPSE of
the King’s Forester.

Tornham quickly pulls himself to his feet and lunges into the
wooden structure --

INT. ROYAL HUNTING LODGE - DAY
Tornham wipes sweat and blood from his brow, SEES the HUNTING

BOWS and ARROWS, grabs up the first longbow and handful cf

You know, Sheriff -~ the Irish
dubbed John “The Red-Handed”...

TORNHAM

Bleeding badly, Gisborne’s arrows still protruding from his
leg and shoulder, leaning up against a tree and NOTCHING his
own ARROW with a trembling hand ~~

GISBORNE (0.8.)
«--but the truth is, he wasn't
willing to get his hands red_
enough. I‘m the one who did all
his killing for him.

Tornham SEES Gisborne through the brush, takes aim and FIRES!

GISBORNE
Looks up in surprise as Tornham’s ARROW sails at him -~ then
MISSES, thudding harmlessly into a tree.
GISBORNE
(smiling)
Close, Sheriff ~~ but not close
enough,

Gisborne whips up his bow and notches an arrow at Lightning-
fast speed, SHOOTING BACK at where Tornham'’s arrow came!

TORNHAM

Leaps out of the way, narrowly escaping being impaled by Sir
Guy's return shot ~- then RACES back into the foliage,
NOTCHING ANOTHER ARROW as he goes...

SOTH MEN BEGIN STALKING EACH OTHER

Firing ARROW after ARROW, barely missing one another, one
hunting the other, both trying desperately fer a kill --

A DUEL OF ARROWS

erupts between the archers -- Gisborne the ace, trained on
the battlefield... and Ternham the amateur, trained by Robin
Hood's lover, Lady Marian —~
113.

TORNEAM
pops up from behind a tree, gets Gisborne in his sights -~
GISBORNE

SEES Tornham, whips up his bow & arrow and lets fly before
fornham gan let fly —-

GISBORNE’S ARROW

RIPS through Tornham's BOW, SHATTERING it to pieces,
SPLINTERS flying into his face, cutting into his fleshi

Tornham drops the remains of the bow and flees for his life,
CHARGING back through the underbrush, weak from logs of
blood, desperate -—~

Gisborne LAUGHS and gives chase ~-
EXT. OAK CAVE — DAY

It's the ENTRANCE to the FOREST CAVE formed from thick,
downed OAK TREES -- where the boar was killed on the Royal
Hunting Party months ago.

Tornham emerges from the brush, SEBS the cave and drags
himself INSIDE the cocoon of fallen oak, trying to catch his
breath --

Tornham stares at Gisborne's arrow protruding from bis _
shoulder -~- then tears a piece of WOOD BARK from one of the
fallen oaks, puts it between his teeth and bites down bard.

He reaches back and BREAKS OFF the feathered END of the arrow
—— then grips the SHAFT of the arrow just above the bloodied
arrowhead, fights back a ery of agony and PULLS, slowly and.
agonizingly vanking the rest of the arrow FROM HIS SHOULDER.

Six Guys VOICE again, thie time getting closer...

GISBORNE (0.8.)
i learned a lot about myself in
Ireland, Sheriff -- and T put that
knowledge to goad use for Prince
John. But then we had to come home --
to a land at peace. John had no
interest in going on Crusade, so I
needed another outlet for my talents.

Tornham reaches down to the other arrow -- the one jatting
out of his leg ~~ BREAKS OFF the feathered end and slowly
PULLS THAT ONE OUT as well.
A SHADOW suddenly fall over the entrance to the oak cave -~

Tornham focuses his pain-blurred vision and SEES Guy of
Gisborne standing over him, bow slung over his shoulder,

gword in hand.
Gisborne GRINS -- the deeply-satisfied grin of a man who has
been waiting for a reward for some time and is finally about
to receive it:
GISBORNE
Your head will make a fine trophy,
Robert Tornham.

Gisborne raises his sword with two~hands, prepares to LOP OFF
TORNHAM'S HEAD --

But Tornbam suddenly grips the arrow that he pulled out of
his own shouldex and STABS IT INTO GISBORNE'S LEG WITH HIS
BARE HANDS!

Gisborne HOWLS in agony, falls to one knee in front of
Toxnbam -~

Yornham grips the other axrow -- the one that he pulled out
of his own leg ~~ and STABS IT INTO GISBORNE’S CHEST!

Gisborne gurgles up blood.

He hesitates... still clutching his sword... still trying to
bring one last blow down on the Sheriff ~~

Then Gisborne collapses in a crumpled heap next to Tornham...

Suddenly they all freeze in their iron boots, their eyes
glued to something at the far end of the Hall...

Eleancr does as her son instructs. As she does, the sound of
PAINFUL SOBBING carries from the far end of the Hall...

Prince John lies doubled-over, head buried in his knees,
dxesaed only in his underclothes, his fine ROYAL GARMENTS of
silk, satin and fur CUT TO SHREDS in a pile beside him.
Lie.

Richard stares down at John for a moment ~-- then speaks to
him in FRENCH w/ENGLISH SUBTITLES:
KING RICHARD
<<Don't be afraid, little brother.
You are young and have been the
victim of bad advice. Your
counselors shall pay for this.>>

<<Now get up and put some clothes

John leaps to his feet, throws himself into Richard’s arms

Forgive me, Richard. Forgive me...

Richard stands there for a moment... then hugs him back.

Eleanor watches, a contented smile gracing her lined but
levely face...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. TORNHAM’S BEDCHAMBER ~ NIGHT

Pale MOONLIGHT trickles in through the shadows. A FIREPLACE
burns, warming the cold stone of the room.

Tornham lies in bed, unconscious, his wounds BANDAGED.

A FEMALE HAND in a NOBLEWOMAN’S GLOVE reaches out and touches
Tornham's forehead.

Tormham’s EYES flutter open.
He focuses on the hand...
TORNHAM
(barely avdible)
Marian...?

But the gloved hand belongs to Eleanor of Aguitaine.

QUEEN ELEANOR
Sorry to disappoint you.

Tornham narrows his eyes at the Queen -— then slowly,
painfully, pulis himself into a sitting position in the bed.

TORNHAM
Forgive me, your Highness.
lL.

QUEEN ELEANOR
No apologies necessary, Sheriff.
You have been overcome by your
wounds for several days. That’s
more than enough excuse for
anything you might have said to
offend my Royal sensibilities.

Tornham notices that Eleanor is holding a DAGGER in her

gloved hand -~ the one Prince John cut off his royal garments
with.
TORNEAM
So,.. who is our King?

QUEEN ELEANOR
Richard rules England once more.
No small thanks to you.

Tornham notices a few FLIES beginning to buzz around the
dagger.

TORNHAM
And what of Gisborne?

QUEEN ELEANOR
Sic Guy is dead. The people say
that the brave and unjustly accused
outlaw Robin Hood took his

vengeance on the murderer ~~ Sir
Guy -~ putting two arrows into
him... and algo wounding Prince

John's tyrannical tax collecting
lackey, the Sheriff of Nottingham.
(a dry smile)
what ig after brave Sir Robin
discovered Gisborne’s hidden
sanatum of horrors and helped the
rightful King, Richard, regain his
Castle.

Ternham smiles with bitter amusement.

He seems to have done it all, this
Robin of Locksley.

QUEEN ELEANOR,
Yes. He’s quite the here.

QUEEN ELEANOR (cont'd)

Men like yourself, steeped in law
and arithmetic, help a kingdom to
function properly but the kingdom
itself would not exist without men
like my Richard -- and your Robin
of Locksley. They are the sort who
will make men proud to be English --
the way Charlemagne and Roland made
them proud to be French.

Eleanor takes out the DEATH-LIST that Tornham found in
Gisborne’s sanctum. She strolls over to the fireplace,
tosses the Death-List into the flames and watches the
parchment BURN...

‘TORNHAM
(quietly)
What did the victims all have in
common, Your Highness? Were they
all supporters of Richard?

Bleanor raises an eyebrow at Tornham, clearly impressed.

TORNHAM (CONT'D)
Gisborne was just following orders,
wasn’t he? Doing Prince John’s
bidding.

QUEEN ELEANOR
Do not mourn for Gisborne. The man
was a beast.

TORNHAM
Who is worgee, Your Highness? A mad
dog -~ or the master who knowingly
sets that dog to prey on innocent
victims?

QUEEN ELBANOR
My Little boy's actions were
regrettable, yes. But he is of
Royal blood --- and his mistakes, no
matter how bad, must not be allowed
to taint the throne. And as for
who ig “innocent” -- I suggest you
leave that to God,

steps to his bedside and leans in close, the dagger still
clutched in her hand ~~

QUEEN ELEANOR (CONT‘D)
(a tight WHISPER)
You know, Sir Guy didn't die in the
woods, Sheriff. He was still alive
when the both of you were found. He
was brought back to the Royal

Physicians... but they were powerless
to do anything except watch him..
expire.

The Sheriff stares as MORE FLIES land on the dagger ~~ a
slight BLOODSTAIN visible on the blade as it catches a sliver
of moonlight.

TORNHAM
And what is my fate to be, Your
Highness?

Eleanor studies the Sheriff for a moment... then gently
KISSES his forehead and rises.

QUEEN ELEANOR
As you well know, the people have
nothing left to tax and times are
very hard -- even for the Nobility.
The only way Richard will be able to
raise funds sufficient for his needa
will be to auction off every key
government post in the kingdom -—
including that of “Sheriff of
Nottingham.” I’m afraid you are not
wealthy enough to keep your job.

TORNHAM
After all this, Richard is leaving
England again?

The Queen shrugs -~

QUEEN ELEANOR
What did you expect? That he would
git on his throne and reign over a
kingdom at peace? Pleasa. My
Richard belongs in France ~~ where
troubadours sing and pasaion rules.
Not here in your land of bailiffs and
“legal precedent.”

Tornham looks away from the Queen, stares into the
fireplace...

QUEEN ELEANOR
Don't worry. For your services to
your King -- and your future
discretion -- you shall have a post

back to France to reconquer the

Tornham considers for a moment -- then shakes his head.
TORNHAM
That's... very generous of you.

But I could not purchase the post

stolen money.

Robin Hood LAUGHS out loud --

HOOD
Can‘t say I didn't try.

Toxnham siniles tightly:

TORNHAM
Tell me, Robin -- after living so
long as a wild outlaw in the
forest... will you be content inside
the walls of your manorhouse?

Robin Hood grins --

HOOD
If it’s a manorhouse fit for a
king... why not?

TORNHAM
Why not indeed.

Tornham turns, mounts his horee, turns back to Robin ~~

TORNHAM (CONT'D)
May you spend many happy hours in
the woods, all of them hunting -~
and none of them breaking the law.

Tornham staxts hie horse off, but Rebin Hood blecks his path:

HOOD
And what about you, Robert of Tornham ~~
master of law and order? Where shall
you go and what shall you do?

TORNHAM
I’m not sure. The King has offered me

HOOD
Well... whether you are hacking
your way through France with King
Richard... or teaching law to
spoiled students at Oxford... you

Nottingham to me,

Tornham himself can’t help but amile a little at that one.
He reaches out and offers his hand ~~

TORNHAM
I‘ ll take that as a compliment.

Robin Hood takes it in his own and the two men shake.
HOOD
Now, if you'll forgive me, I have a
