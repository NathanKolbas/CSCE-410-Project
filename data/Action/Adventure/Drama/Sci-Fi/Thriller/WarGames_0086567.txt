FADE IN:
RED RIVER VALLEY, NORTH DAKOTA ~ DUSK
A blizzard fills the SCREEN.

Headlights gradually emerge and a van with military
plates comes to a stop next to a guard gate. Two :
hooded figures climb out and struggle against the
freezing wind towards what looks like a farmer's house.

INT. FARMER'S HOUSE

The two men remove snow-clogged boots and soppin
parkas, revealing bright blue jumpsuits with "32lsc

Missile Wing" emblazoned on the back, and offsetting
orange ascots.

We're inside a Minuteman III Missile Launch Control
Center.

JERRY, the older and huskier of the two, opens a locked
satchel chained to his wrist and slides a red folder
under the window to a GUARD sitting behind bullet-proof
glass. The Guard opens the folder, examines two photo
ID'S, and studies the men's faces. He picks up a
phone. -

GUARD
Replacement team's here, sir.

Right. .

Come on through. Another twenty

minutes and we were going to start
looking for you.

jerry and his deputy, STEVE -- clean cut, new Air Force
— are buzzed through into the secure area. The Guard
again compares their faces with the photos, then
returns the folder and hands them two service pistols
with holsters.

STEVE
See you tomorrow.

bomb. It could. As the elevator doors open, an
begins to WAIL.

Jerry and Steve walk along a corridor to reach the door
to. the launch capsule.
Jerry punches out a code on a keyboard to the side of
the oval door. The door is opened by the missile COM-
MANDER and his DEPUTY inside the launch capsule. The
alarm stops.

THE LAUNCH CAPSULE 4

The 10 x20 foot capsule is crammed with panels of high-
frequency transmitters, circuit breakers, air purifi-
cation and backup systems, a high-speed printer with
direct line to SAC headquarters, one refrigerator, one
small and unprivate latrine, and two launch consoles.
twelve feet apart.

Each launch console has a computer terminal and a large
annunciator panel that gives the status of each of the
ten missiles controlled by this capsule.

A bright red strongbox with two combination locks is
mounted on the capsule wall.

Steve unstraps his holster, hangs it on a hook, and
sits down at the red chair at his console while Jerry
walks to the rear of the capsule and inspects his
moustache in the mirror.

crests of the Rocky Mountains can be seen below.

EXT. CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN — DAY 15

Descending towards the bulk of a single massive peak,
details of the landscape can be seen. A blue Air Force
station wagon climbs-a winding road and stops at a

EXT. NORAD - ARRIVAL AREA - DAY : 16

Two men, distinguished by the careful tailoring of top
echelon Washington bureaucrats, get out.

ARTHUR CABOT, oldest of the two, is immediately greeted
by PATRICIA HEALY, thirtyish, a civilian employee of
the Defense Department.

loading area. They get into a small electric tug and
head through two huge blast doors that lead into the
Combat Operations Center: A windowless city of fifteen
buildings constructed inside a five-acre grid of inter-
connecting chambers. Each building sits clear of thé
rock walls on massive hydraulic shock absorbers.

INT. NORAD COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM : 19

DR. JOHN McKITTRICK, a Senior Advisor with the Depart-
ment of Defense, leans over a table top of blueprint
schematics. He discusses the fine points of a vast.
computer system with his Assistant, PAUL RICHTER, a
rumpled and high-strung young man.

Pat Healy enters and McKittrick glances up.

Twenty-three minutes from warning

MONITOR: GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN

DAVID: HELLO, ARE YOU STILL PLAYING THE GAME?

MONITOR: OF COURSE. I SHOULD REACH DEFCON 1 AND
LAUNCH MY MISSILES IN 28 HOURS. WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SEE SOME PROJECTED KILL RATIOS?

A series of figures jump onto the screen.

DAVID: IS THIS A GAME OR IS IT REAL?

_ After several seconds, the program finally responds.

MONITOR: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

David is momentarily stunned. He lowers his gaze to
the flickering numbers of the game's time clock.

MONITOR: GAMES TIME ELAPSED; 45HRS 32MINS 47SECS

David watches ‘the countdown for a few seconds, then
suddenly Joshua resumes the conversation.

MONITOR: YOU ARE A HARD MAN TO REACH. COULD NOT FIND
YOU IN SEATTLE AND NO TERMINAL IS IN
OPERATION AT YOUR CLASSIFIED ADDRESS. ARE
YOU ALIVE OR DEAD TODAY? :

DAVID: STOP PLAYING. I'M DEAD.

The door opens behind David and Wigan appears with
Federal Agents AYERS and STOCKMAN. Seeing David at
the monitor, Wigan reacts.
WIGAN
Get him away from that thing.
Ayers and Stockman pull David away from the monitor.
AVID
Look, can I please talk to Mr.

Ayers removes a pair of handcuffs as Wigan begins a
recitation. :

DAVID
Espionage? No, look, there's

Wigan ignores David. He extends a piece of paper.

WIGAN
David... this is a Miranda. It
informs you of your rights.
Read it over. Then if you'll
just sign it for me, please.

David signs the paper reluctantly.

David stares at the door, stunned. He starts pacing,
working himself up into a frustrated rage. He spots a
2' X 2' metal panel screwed into the wall near the
door. He looks around the room.

David goes over to the sink and tries the drawers below
it. They're all locked except the top one. He opens
it. Towels, gauze, adhesive tape» tongue depressors.
Nothing useful. He shoves it closed.

Suddenly David looks back at the drawer. He pulls it
all the way out, and sets it on the floor. He reaches
inside to the drawer below and starts piling things on
the counter: disposable syringes, ace bandages, a
hand-held cassette recorder, a stethoscope ... and a
pair of tweezers.

He starts putting things back into the drawer, pauses
when he gets to the cassette recorder. It has an
earphone attached to the strap. David pushes the

launch code, which would appear at the bottom of the
computer screen.

Suddenly ten bold white characters —— three letters,
four digits, three letters — appear at the bottom of
the screen, changing rapidly, in seemingly random
order. .

McKITTRICK
The machine has locked us out,
it's still trying to launch those
missiles.

There's an eighty percent chance
of it finding the bunch codes in

BERINGER .
Just unplug the goddamn thing.
Jesus Christ!!

McKITTRICK
We can't. It would interpret any
shut down as if this facility were
destroyed in an attack. The
computers at the silos will cerry
out their last instruction, whic
was to launch.

BERINGER
McKittrick, after careful
consideration I am prepared to
tell you that your new defense
system sucks.

something better than that. Man

McKittrick draws a blank. So does Major Len.

Yes. Wumber of players: Zero.

David requests a new game. It asks the number of
players.. David glances around the Crystal Palace, at
the faces looking up. He takes a deep breath and hits
the key.

DAVID: ZERO
An X appears in the center of the grid.

O's and X's fill in the squares to a stalemate. The
moves vanish. :

David watches the big board, repeatedly hitting the
ENTER key as if trying to prompt Joshua.

General Beringer silently approaches the group gathered
behind David at the console.

consumes more and more system power... moves appear and
are wiped ovt with an increasing frequency... until the
huge grid is filled with a blur of dueling symbols...

JOSHUA: HOW ABOUT A NICE GAME OF CHESS?

Jennifer laughs at the idea. David looks up and turns
to Falken. The first bars of the end TITLE SONG are
heard as Falken gently smiles at Joshua's invitation.
Falken looks over at David. They exchange sniles.

INT. ARCADE - DAY 267A

As the SONG CONTINUES, David wanders slowly through the
arcade in which we first encountered him. He seems
strangely more mature, more at ease, less frenetic than
the youths who obsessively play computer games around

him.

His reverie is interrupted by the appearance of
Jennifer. He smiles. They speak. She coaxes @ laugh,
then she whispers something and he laughs again.

As the SONG CONTINUES, computer imagery blends with the.
play world of Joshua. The excitement of military
personnel, playing the game on the big board can

read in their expressions and the computer imagery 0
the Crystal Palace and ‘the play world: of the arcade,
linked by the lyric of the song provides in a bizarre
counterpoint the jronic union between games of power

and destruction both large and small.
