TITLE SEQUENCE
EXT. EUROPEAN VILLAGE ~ STREET - NIGHT

On a heavily shadowed street, two enemy Guards patrol a
tactically important village block. Inside the most
Prominent building, a party is in Progress, music wafting
out into the street. The two Guards meet at a corner near
the party's entrance, one loaning a cigarette to the other.
Then they reverse their directions, walk apart, the Second
Guard disappearing into the darkness of the night. Titles
begin.

Suddenly, Jack Flack, everything a spy should be, swoops
into view, riding a square American-flag parachute down
from a nearby rooftop. Red, white, and blue cut through
the darkness as he lands directly on top of the First Guard.

The parachute envelops them both. Two bodies thrash within
the silk. A moment later, Flack steps out, glances down the
empty street. He wears a pair of tight pants and a beauti-
fully cut brown leather jacket, molded perfectly to his
broad shoulders, tapering to a tight fit around his slender
waist. .

He pushes a hidden button on his jacket, and, with a whoosh,
the parachute repacks itself instantly back into the jacket,
showing not even a Lump.

TITLES “CONTINUE. ©”

The Second Guard turns around, heads back toward the party
building.

Jack Flack strolls nonchalantly up to the Second Guard, who
challenges him.

SECOND GUARD
(in Russian)
Halt! Identify yourself.

A moment of tension is followed by Jack Flack suavely
responding by pulling out a silver cigarette case, getting
out a cigarette.

JACK FLACK
(in impeccable
Russian)
Do you have a light?

The Second Guard looks suspicious, pumps the action on his
rifle.

Jack Flack blows a feather-tufted poison dart from his
cigarette and into the neck of the Second Guard, who
instantly stumbles and falls. TITLES CONTINUE.

An expensive period limo pulls up. Out of it steps a
villainous Iranian (with an uncanny resemblance to Khomeini),
arm-in-arm with the lovely Lady Gillingham, a voluptuous
Englishwoman. They are followed by a fat Soviet diplomat,
who carries a thin black briefcase chained to his right

arm.

From the shadows, Flack makes his move: just as the black
bag is passing him, he whips out a cord from his Jack Flack
spy watch, with the same action used to start a chainsaw.
Indeed, he is starting a chainsaw, a miniature one. Its
tiny but effective blade running from his watch to his
other hand. He instantly cuts through the chain, grabs the
black bag, and the flexible saw retracts back into his
watch.

The Iranian lunges at him with a scimitar. Flack deftly
kicks the knife high into the night sky, then Kung Fu kicks
the Iranian! Lady Gillingham draws a Luger from a bra
holsterette, fires at Flack, who cleverly doffs his
official hat with the shiny bulletproof-steel inner liner.
He holds the hat shield between himself and the bullet,
causing it to ricochet off and plant itself right between
Lady Gillingham's beautiful eyes.

The Russian diplomat pulls one of those bowling ball-type
bombs out of his pocket, its fuse already burning. He
tesses it at Flack, whose spy drill kit Presents itself. He
instantly drills three holes in the burning bomb, inserts
his fingers into it, and, exhibiting pro bowler prowess,
bowls it at the diplomat and a group of soldiers, who are
running in pin formation to his aid. The bomb explodes,
sending them flying.

Jack Flack knows enemy reinforcements are on the way, so he
ducks around the corner, the prized black bag safe in his
hands. TITLES CONTINUE.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT - FLACK

case when suddenly a huge steel gate seems to slam down from
the sky, sealing off the alley ahead of him.

As Jack wheels and starts back the way he came, the earth
rumbles beneath his feet.

The source of the rumble becomes immediately clear, as two
monstrous twenty-sided, brightly colored geometric forms
come rolling around the corner and directly at Flack.

Frantically, the spy again reverses his direction, runs for
his life back toward the newly dropped steel gate.

Credits end as Flack seems destined to be crushed by the
frightening geometric boulders.

But just then, in the nick of time, Jack Flack is invisibly
lifted out of the scene.

MATCH DISSOLVE To
INT. MORRIS'S GAME SHOP - BACK ROOM - DAY 4

A lead figure of Jack Flack is being lifted out of a two-
dimensional match for the location we have just seen. There
are bombs, foreign agents, a limo, the black case, even the
steel gate. Camera pulls back to reveal Davey Osborne,
eleven, doing the lifting. He is excited about the success
of his roll of brightly colored geometric dice.

DAVEY
Twenty-four! Jack Flack's agility (X)

Camera. continues back to reveal two others sitting around
the board game called "Cloak and Dagger."

Kim Gardener is nine. Morris Coffey, thirty, is the pro-
prietor of Morris's Game Emporium. He is nearsighted, over-
weight and immature for his age.

Kim is disappointed in Davey's success.

gas masks and a bulletproof vest. -

Two men in dark suits, Opbst and Haverman, stop beside
them, also waiting for an elevator. Already threatening in
appearance, we can see that Davey's imagination is running
wild about them.

But then it stops being fantasy, as Haverman shoves back
his suit coat and hikes his pants. Davey is at eye level
to the man's waist and finds himself staring at a loaded
-38 in a belt holster. His eyes widen.

Davey tries to get Kim's attention to tell her about the
gun. He can't. He tries coughing. She looks oddly to
Davey, who is looking even more oddly to her.

Davey is still climbing, now lowering the antenna on his
radio, aware that he has been shut off by his partner.
He looks miffed.

From 0.S. comes a strong, resonant male voice.

FLACK (0.S.)
Your friend cut off radio contact,
did she?

Davey stops, sees Jack Flack materialize out of thin air.

He looks real and man-sized. He's just as winded as Davey,
but he's everything a spy should be, at least as a child
would imagine it: tall and slender, wearing a black turtle-
neck and leather jacket with a bulge under the armpit where
his Walther PPK hangs ready and waiting. But it is his

face that is most distinctive. Chiseled granite with two
cold, pitiless eyes.

DAVEY
Oh, hi, Jack.

FLACK
Some people just don't know how to act
on a secret mission. We're better off
handling this one on our own.

DAVEY
Yeah, I guess so.

Davey follows Jack Flack up the stairs. Both spies draw
their Walther PPKs and proceed. (Xx)

FLACK (X)

This reminds me of my assignment

We were surrounded by hordes of
angry mercenaries...all I had on

Flack notices that Davey has lost interest in the story (X)
momentarily. The boy is distracted as he notices in

the opposite mirrored building that Jack has no reflection.

Then Jack notices, trying to make out what had Davey's

interest outside. They continue climbing.

Murdoch sees Davey and stumbles to a halt, reaching out to
support himself against the boy, causing Davey's backpack to
spill much of its contents: the lead Jack Flack, his soft-
ball, his bottle of Monster Blood, his radio, etc. Murdoch
stares at the frightened boy. He speaks in a death rattle,
his eyes burning into Davey.

MURDOCH
Help me ---

The boy can only stare at him in horror. Murdoch grabs his
shoulder. He thrusts a tape cartridge into Davey's hand.

MURDOCH
(dying)
Here. Whatever happens, don't let
them get it. They have to be stopped.

Davey glances down to find a Donkey Kong game cartridge in
his hand. Before he can ask any questions Murdoch speaks
through a cough that flecks the side of his mouth with blood.

MURDOCK
Tell the FBI: one million two {X)
hundred thirty-seven.

The steel fire door bangs open on the floor above. Murdoch
glances up fearfully, then back at Davey.

MURDOCH

down the stairs)
Run!

Suddenly two silent slugs slam into the dying man. They
whip him around and catapult him back first ever the stair-
way railing. As Davey watches in horror, Murdoch's body
falls seven flights down the stairwell, bouncing off
railings and walls to land with a sickening thud at the
bottom, far below.

Davey looks up to see where the shots came from. Peering
down at him from a railing on the floor above are Haverman
and Opbst, the two men from the elevator. Opbst has a Luger
with a silencer on it in his hand, still smoking. He aims
at the boy, about to fire.

Davey grabs his backpack and whatever spilled items he can
quickly salvage, missing the softball. He whirls and
plunges down the stairs, spoiling Opbst's shot. The
killers bound down the steps after him.

INT. DAVEY'S ROOM - NIGHT 138

It's more a refuge than it is a bedroom. The walls are
dotted with fantasy posters, the shelves filled with model
airplanes, tanks and fantasy role-playing games like
Dungeons and Dragons, Traveller, and Blitzkrieg. The place
of honor on the desk is taken up by an Atari and a TV.

Davey sits in front of a dresser mirror Playing with toy (x)
soldiers.

After a moment, there is a soft knock on his door.

Davey doesn't respond. A moment later, the door creaks
open. Davey's father peers in.

HAL
Ready to talk?

Davey sits up. Hal joins him on the bed.

Well, Jack Flack and these ridicu-

Hal starts picking up some of Davey's more fanciful games,
as though he intends to take them away.

DAVEY
No!

Davey digs into his backpack.

DAVEY

dare)
You want to see something? You

Davey pulls out the Donkey Kong game cartridge, waves it to
his father, goes to his Atari, turns it on, turns on the TV
set, sticks in the cartridge.

DAVEY
"Donkey Kong,' right?

With a flourish, he pushes the Play button. Both Hal and
Davey await a dramatic revelation.

Davey goes into the game, the electronic little boy on the
screen trying to climb the cliff while Donkey Kong holds
the damsel in distress above him and rolls boulders down at
the boy. As the singsong game music Plays, Davey shoots
glances at his father, while trying to play the game and
discover its secret.

games, thinking he's done with them forever.

Davey bursts out the front door, stopping his father just
as he's about to climb into his old Mustang. Hal Osborne
is dressed in an Air Force Master Sergeant's uniform,
obviously on his way to report for duty. He stops and
turns back as his son rushes up to him.

Davey stops just inside the front door, listening to the
everyday sounds which have taken on a newly terrifying
quality. A dripping faucet, the ticking hall clock,

the refrigerator motor, especially passing cars. Now that

something spooky about the silence. It makes Davey nervous.

There's no way to run, nbthing for him to do except plunge
into the water where he'll make a slow moving target for

Pack the place. Davey moves through the throng searching
for a glimpse of Opbst and Rice. They're nowhere to be seen.

A small knot of tourists dissolves at the far end of the
room and Davey suddenly sees Rice. The killer checks his
watch, hikes the camera bag over his shoulder, and begins
to move. Davey is directly in his path. If he glances up,
he must see the boy. Davey dives behind the first adult he
sees, a woman he doesn't even recognize in his panic.

Eunice MacCready, the nice lady from the boat, looks down
at him curiously, her husband beside her pawing through the
postcard rack.

Kim sits in the dark, biting her nails as she waits for her
mother to come home. The phone rings on the table beside
her. She picks it up.

KIM
Mom?

DAVEY
Kim, it's me. Did you tell your
mother?

KIM

(upset)
No. She hasn't come home yet. I
don't know where she is. She had
to cater somewhere, but I can't
read her writing. It's ineligible.

DAVEY
Kim, you gotta get to the airport.
Right now!

KIM
Davey, it's past my bedtime!

DAVEY

INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT - INTERCUT BETWEEN DAVEY HIDING @5

Davey sees Rice, Haverman, and Opbst returning toward the
trunk. The thugs are pocketing their share of the money.
Davey hangs up on Kim, ducks below the front seat.

OPBST
What about the girl? You want us to
get her, too?

RICE
I've already taken care of that.

Puzzled looks from Opbst and Haverman. Rice pulls a
triggering device out of his pocket. It is an everyday
household item.

OPBST
What's that?

HAVERMAN
Model airplane control.

OPBST
What're ya gonna do? Dive bomb her?
Heh heh.

Haverman chuckles along with his pal. Rice doesn't laugh.

Instead, with a certain amount of pride, he pushes a little
button, bringing a ba tery power indicator into the green/

Opbst pulls a pistol from his belt. Rice and Haverman do
the same.

He won't get far.

Inside the car, Davey's eyes widen with fear. Behind him,
seen through the car windows, the three killers start to
spread out in their search. Davey locks the front doors
and reaches for the ignition key.

INT. GARAGE ~ NIGHT 89

All three killers suddenly freeze as the Caddy engine leaps
to life. Rice raises his pistol, stares at the car.

Sorry.

As the car suddenly shoots forward, Flack is knocked back
over the seat by the tremendous acceleration.

FLACK
I'm okay, just keep drivin'!

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 93

The three killers leap to their feet and run after the car
as it caroms off another post then off the the walls and up
the ramp.

INT. CADDY - NIGHT 94

The car is going like a fitful bat out of hell, scraping
along the walls at one point, stripping away paint and
tearing off chrome, clipping a corner at another point,
demolishing a headlight, going in fits and starts up the
ramps and through the various levels of the garage as Davey
either peers over the steering wheel, out the window or
slips beneath the wheel to give it more gas.

Flack sits behind him, enjoying the ride.
FLACK
Not bad for your first lesson!

The Cadillac has come to a forced halt against a wall.
Inside the car, Davey finds reverse, and the car burns
rubber, backing up a dozen yards, then skids to a halt as
Davey slams on the brakes.

The Guard begins flashing the lights as people begin to move
out. As Davey watches, Rice carefully puts down his camera
case and steps forward, Nikon in hand, seemingly framing a
snapshot of a painting of Davey Crocket. Davey dodges
through the crowd, heading for the camera case.

Rice turns just as Davey steps out of a knot of tourists,
grabs the case, and darts back into the crowd. Rice yells
after him.

RICE
Hey!

Davey darts across the Alamo, past the rather startled
Mr. and Mrs. MacCready, heading for the front door. A
security Guard steps out to grab him, but Davey dodges
him, slamming through the front door, pursued by both the

George takes his eyes from the road long enough to toss an
amused glance at the dispirited boy in the seat beside him.

What makes you so sure I gave the
wrong case back?

DAVEY
Pardon?

case in Davey's

Davey opens the case, hardly daring to believe the tape
might actually be there. But there it is at the bottom of
the case, black and rectangular with that stupid logo on
it. Davey whips the tape out, flashing George a joyous
smile.

You got it!

See. I told you. George is real

Missing. Davey stares at the mutilated hand in numb
horror. Eunice frowns at the boy.

He makes a sudden dive over her for the door, but George

EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER - NIGHT 122-A

Davey runs along the river then through an arched tunnel
beneath the road that passes overhead, leaving his pursuers
far behind.

EXT. RIVER WALK - NIGHT 123

He picks up his pace and runs headlong along the tree-lined
path. He disappears into the shadows of another bridge on
the run.

EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 124

Davey trips and sprawls headfirst onto the path, ripping
his pants.

He sits up, grabbing his knee. He's skinned it badly, blood
beginning to well up through the torn skin.

Flack suddenly steps out of the shadows, staring back the
way Davey just came, listening hard.

Good luck!

EXT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT 125

Opbst pads along silently, his gaze probing every nook and
cranny, every shadow along the walk.

Davey crouches in the darkness of the tunnel. He stares
into the darkness as the spy passes. Nearby, a rat chirps
and scurries out from near Davey. Opbst shoots him. Then
there is silence again. But Davey now looks around for
ether rats that might be surrounding him. He turns and
looks along the path. There, glimpsed for a moment in a
splash of moonlight is Rice.

Davey takes a deep breath, gulps, and suddenly jumps up
shouting and waving his hands.

DAVEY
Hey, Ricey! Whatsamatter? Can't
ya shoot straight?

EXTERIOR, -. FURTHER BACK =NIGHT. .... ve te re en BBL

 

Rice's gaze is torn from the path directly ahead of him, and
toward the boy in the tunnel. All he sees is the kid jumping
around, mocking him, laughing at him. He whips the Schmeizer
machine gun up and fires, stitching a line of bullets along
the walk behind the boy, slowly catching up to him as Davey
breaks into a run, dashing through the tunnel after Opbst.

EXT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT 127

Opbst stands beyond the tunnel, looking back the way

he just came, listening to the soft sound of the bullets
smashing into the dirt along the path. Suddenly Davey

With one glance over his shoulder at the sound of Rice's
approaching footsteps, the super spy dashes after the boy.
EXT. RIVER WALK - DEAD END - NIGHT 128

Davey skids to a sudden halt, facing a blank concrete wall,
twenty feet high. He's reached a dead end. He whirls,
looking to his left: nothing there but more high wall. He
glances to his right: nothing there but the river. He
stares back the way he's just come. He can hear Rice's
footsteps pounding toward him out of the darkness. He's
trapped with nowhere left to run.

Farther down the walk, Rice runs into view, stopping as he
sees the cornered boy. Smiling, he slowly starts to walk
toward him. Davey backs away, raising Opbst's Luger in the
dark.

DAVEY

Davey bumps to a halt, his back against the wall, no further
to go, no place to run or hide, trapped. He holds the Luger
up, pointing it directly at Rice's face.

FLACK (x)
Shoot! Pull the trigger...!
DAVEY
Stop, please, stop. I don't want to

Rice, alarmed at the possibility of an accomplice with
Davey, instinctively whips his Schmeizer around, shoots a
burst of machine-gun fire at the super spy.

The pyrotechnics are wild, as a mixture of brightly glowing
tracer bullets and standard ammunition flies through
Flack's semitransparent body, throwing him back as each
slug enters and passes through his body, tearing through
his flesh and clothing, then crashing into the wall behind
him. It is a spectacular death, and it horrifies Davey to
see his friend murdered.

DAVEY

screaming)
Nott!

Davey raises the Luger, fires it at Rice, the bullet
slamming into the killer, right between the eyes,
propelling him backward, the part of his face which can
still be seen now looking stunned, just before the blood
gushes. Rice topples into the river, and floats away.

Davey runs over to where Jack had just been. He seems to
have vanished.

DAVEY
Jack!

Jack materializes behind Davey, in perfectly good shape.
There is no sign of any physical damage. Just a little

dust. The kind you get playing guns. He brushes himself
off.

Who cares! You're a hero now.

Davey looks at Rice's body, bobbing in the river. He

But it is too late. Davey throws it right through Flack,
causing it to bounce off the concrete wall and land back
near his feet. Davey stomps on it, bending the lead
pathetically out of shape.

The boy and the super spy remain frozen on the walk. Flack

Davey rises and turns, searching the ground for the smokes

Behind him, Jack Flack begins to fade, his body turning
more and more transparent. His dying eyes are on Davey,
taking a last glance at his friend. A sweet sad, wistful
smile wreathes his lips and an instant later the super
spy snaps out of existence, gone into the night air
forever.

Davey can't find the cigarettes and turns back to tell
Flack, only to discover he isn't there any longer.

The Guard behind her forces her gently back into her seat.
Kim looks at him like she'd like to kill him. The camera

Davey looks up and down the terminal, waiting for some sight
of Kim. There is none. His eye catches a computer screen
overhead listing all the arriving and departing flights.

He has no trouble finding Flight _ to Mexico City.

The word "Boarding Now" flashes on beside it. He tears his
eyes away, glancing at his watch. Five minutes left till
the bomb goes off.

He looks up and down the terminal, desperately searching
for some sight of Kim.

Davey looks at the long line. By the time he is searched
and passes through the machine, the MacCreadys will be long
gone. They know that, too, and turn to go on their way.
Davey watches them go, not knowing what to do for a

moment. Suddenly he wails at the MacCreadys like some
long, lost child.

DAVEY
Mom, Dad, please, don't leave me!

The MacCreadys freeze again, glancing back as the Guard
turns around to look at them. They hurry on their way,

The MacCreadys stop, exchanging glances. George turns to
the Guard, doing his best to smile.

Holding Davey by the hand, he walks him toward the

But I assure you, officer, this boy's

I've still got to see that bag.
Now, please, give it to me.

Furious, George glowers down at Davey. Davey gives hima
huge smile in return. George's eyes snap to the trash can
with his pistol in it on the other side of the metal
detector, suddenly wishing he hand't ditched it.

Suddenly the security office door to the side of the
checkpoint opens and Kim steps out followed by the Chief of
Security and the Guard that originally took her in there.
She sees Davey and yells at the top of her lungs.

KIM

He whirls, seeing her at the same time. They take off on
the run for each other.

DAVEY
Kim, quick, give me the walkie-

George and Eunice glance up. All they see is a little girl
rushing toward them followed by two security guards.

Thinking they've been discovered, George goes crazy. He
smashes the Guard beside him across the chest with his
overnight case, slamming the man back against the wall. As
the man slumps to the floor stunned, George grabs his gun out

of his holster and whips it up, pointing it at the approaching
security guards.

Before she can say anything, he rips her backpack off, Paws
through it, and grabs the walkie-talkie. He looks around
wildly for somewhere to get rid of the bomb. He sees a
door behind the MacCreadys with a glowing "Exit" sign above
it. He vaults the inspection area stand and dashes for it.

George reaches out and snags Davey on the way, throwing a
choke hold on the boy and using him as a body shield
between himself and the guards, yelling at them as he holds
the gun to Davey's head.
