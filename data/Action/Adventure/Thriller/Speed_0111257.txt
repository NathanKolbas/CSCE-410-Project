FADE IN:
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - TWLI GHT
A highrise in downtown L.A., framed tall against the
mountains. People stream out of the front door, leaving
work.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT

In the near darkness of basement, a security guard makes
his way into an inner cellar. His flashlight finds a man
in work clothes bent over a panel, his back to the light.

GUARD
Hey. This area's restricted.

The man doesn't look around. We can just almost see his
face as he talks.

MAN
Yeah, |, uh, got calledin...
some of this wiring got screwed up.
GUARD
Nobody called it down to me. I'm
gonna have to see a work order.
MAN
Yeah ... Just one second...

CLOSEUP ON HIS HAND
reaches into his toolbox.

He rises, turning, and A KNIFE |S SHOVED THROUGH HIS EAR.
It is pulled back out with calmefficiency. The man turns,
wide-eyed, hand to his ear. Mouth open in silent protest.
Out of his hand drops the work order. He slumps over.
Dies.

HOWARD FISK takes off the guard's hat. Dripping knife
aside, he is an ordinary-looking man. His face is dead
calm, only his eyes betraying the sea of hate behind it.

He drags the body into a dark corner, grabbing a duffle bag
from out of the shadows. Then checking his watch, he goes
to the panel and begins making adjustments of his own. WE
PAN over to the door of the panel. It reads: ELEVATORS.

SMASH CUT TO
EXT. OUTSIDE BUILDING - EVENING

A car comes SCREECHING to a halt near the front of the
building, a red and blue light flashing on top. The door
is thrown open and SWAT officer JACK TRAVEN steps out from
behind the wheel almost before the car has stopped. Jack
heads straight for the entrance as HARRY TEMPLE, his older
partner gets out the other side and follows, tossing Jack
his flak jacket. Jack puts it on without ever taking his
eyes off the entrance as they make their way through police
cars, fire trucks and various uniforms. WE SEE these two
are a team, and that when they move, Jack takes the lead.

We are still TRACKING with Jack and Harry as WE SEE two

more SWAT guys emerge from another car, fall into step.
Another team joins them as they enter the:
INT. LOBBY

Just as another pair burst in through another set of doors
finally eight SWAT members all wordlessly sync, walking
with Jack and Harry until the whole unit stands in front of:

CAPTAIN HERB MCMAHON, 40s, on the PHONE...NORWOOD, his
technical assistant, looks at BLUEPRINTS with BAGWELL, a
middle-aged guy with "building maintenance supervisor" on
his worksuit.

Then McMahon hangs up the phone, addresses the group.

MCMAHON
What we have is fifteen people on
the express elevator just below
floor thirty. Included among them
is Louis Tremain, chairman of Nu-
Tech and owner of this building.
(more)

( CONT! NUED)
CONT! NUED:

MCMAHON (cont'd)
Bomb took out the cables. Bomber

wants three million dollars, or he
blows the emergency brakes.

HARRY
What's our clock?

NORWOOD

He gave one hour, which leaves us
with twenty-three minutes exactly.

A COP
Anything else that'll stop the
elevator from falling?

JACK
The basement.

BAGWELL
That's the truth.

MCMAHON
The city is looking to avoid that
event. They're gonna release the
money.

HARRY
(not really asking)
We can't just unload the
passengers.

MCMAHON
Bomber's wired the elevator doors
and the hatch to trigger the bomb.
Which seats himin the crazy but
not stupid section.

JACK

Harry volunteers to examine the
device.

COMBAT BOOTS thunder up a metal staircase. Jack and Harry
sprint up the stairs.

Jack and Harry crawl through and stand on top of the
elevator, Jack addressing the passengers while Harry checks
out the bomb. Jack has to raise his voice to be heard.

Jack is looking at the access panel. There is a moment
before he comes back to Harry's train of thought: Then:
JACK
Shoot the hostage.
HARRY
What ?
JACK

Take her out of the equation. Go
for the good wound and he can't
get to the plane with her. Clear

HARRY
You're deeply nuts, Jack. Shoot

Maybe we can do something about
those hostages.

HARRY
We're not gonna shoot ‘em, right?

CUT TO:
EXT. ROOF - DUSK
Jack bursts out of a roof access door and starts looking
for something. Harry follows him. Jack runs over to the
edge of the roof where there is a WNCH used by window-
washers. Large, heavy-duty.
JACK
No, we just take 'em out of the
equation.

INT. ELEVATOR - SAME TI ME
The passengers, white with terror, fidget.

Jack and Harry lug cable fromthe winch into the elevator
housing on the roof.

Captain McMahon paces with his walkie talkie, talking to
the brass at city hall.

MCMAHON
We can't GET any more time! He's
not talking. We need goddamn
money NOW.

CUT TO:
INT. ANOTHER PLACE - SAME TI ME

Fisk has a radio set-up, is listening in on the various
police exchanges. He suddenly hears sounds of Harry and
Jack echoing down the elevator shaft.

HARRY
Pop quiz, hot shot. Psycho rigs
an elevator to drop thirty
stories...

CUT TO:
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
Jack is being lowered headfirst on a rope down the center
of the shaft. He holds the window-washing cable with a
hook on its end. He and Harry are speaking through their
microphones.

HARRY
.What do you do?

JACK
Something else, right?

He continues down. The elevator approaches. Jack comes to
the elevator car...He signals and Harry stops.

( CONTI NUED)
CONT! NUED

Jack looks leery at the C4 by his feet. Quietly secures
the hook to part of the elevator's frame.

JACK
Tell me again, Harry: why did
take this job?
HARRY
Come on. Thirty more years of
this and you get a tiny pension
and a cheap gold watch.
JACK
(excited)
Cool.
ANOTHER PLACE
Fisk listens. What are they up to?
HOUSI NG SHED
Harry looks down the shaft one more time and runs out to:
EXT. ROOF

Harry runs over to the window washing winch. He flips a
switch and the winch starts pulling in the cable.

INT. SHAFT

Jack watches as the extra cable starts unspooling, pulled
up. He starts climbing for the access panel.

EXT. ROOF

The winch spools in cable.

INT. HOUSING SHED

Harry looks down at the elevator.

ANOTHER PLACE

Fisk listens, hears the winch faintly. He fingers a small
box with a plastic button and a timer counting down. Three
minutes left. We notice that the hand fingering the box is
missing its thumb.

( CONTI NUED)
CONT! NUED

he hand starts moving more agitatedly. Fisk's face
registers growing concern. Two minutes fifty-three seconds.

Wth sudden violence, he jabs the button.

NT. ELEVATOR

Jack takes one final look down. There is still a bunch of
slack cable lying on the elevator. On the bomb, atiny red
ight comes one.

Wthout hesitation Jack HURLS himself through the access
panel as the bomb BLOWS.

Let's get them off.

EXT. ROOF - THE W NDOW- WASHI NG W NCH

The weight on the cable is starting to pull it fromits
foundation. It groans and starts to crack -- can't bear
this weight for long. The wheels start to come off the
track. Then with a loud bang, the winch breaks free, flies
across the roof and comes to a stop at the door to the
elevator machine room.

INT. HALL

Jack and Harry look at each other. And BOLT.

ANOTHER FLOOR - JACK AND HARRY

Emerge fromthe stairs, race over to the elevator access
panel...

HARRY

Mac! We need people on 28 now!
THE Wi NDOW WASHING W NCH
Gives a bit more under the strain of the cable...

THE ELEVATOR

It drops a fewinches. People yell, gasp, cry.
JACK AND HARRY

Get the last screw out of another access panel. They can
see the bottomtwo feet of the elevator doors. Wth a
grunt they pry open the doors. People's feet and the
sounds of panic.

JACK/ HARRY
On the floor! Hands and knees!
Let's move it!

A WOMAN lies down. Jack and Harry grab her hands, pull her
out. Then another. They pull out the CEO.

giving way slowly, an inch at a time.

Now pull people up to get them out. They see the elevator
sinking, the opening closing. Two and a half feet. Two
feet. They have one woman to pull out. She's halfway...
her legs still in...

THE CABLE

Pulls free as the mass of wood and metal finally gives way.

Drops.

The elevator drops like a rock, trailing cable. It drops
so far that it disappears from sight. A huge sound when it
hits bottom.

INT. MAIN LOBBY

McMahon and the other SWAT and bomb guys are almost knocked
off their feet by the impact reverberating throughout the
building.

ELEVATOR DOORS

In the lobby buckle out fromthe air concussion.

INT. HALL

The woman, terrified, looks down at her legs. The elevator
just clipped off her high heel. Jack and Harry exchange a
look.

The other SWAT guys usher the rescued passengers to the
stairwell as Jack and Harry lean against the wall, a little
out of breath.

JACK
Is your watch sl ow?

HARRY
(shaking his head)
He jumped the gun. We had three
minutes.

Why does he do that? He's blowing

Jack points at the hatch cover on the elevator roof. Harry
nods and pulls his Glock. He and Jack kneel by the hatch
cover. Jack grabs the handle. Harry makes the countdown
hand signals. Three, two -

A shotgun BLAST nearly takes their heads off, splintering
part of the hatch cover. Both men jump back. A second
shot right by Harry's foot sends him jumping away, he steps
on the hatch cover and it gives away. He falls into the
elevator, hitting his head badly.

JACK

We HEAR Harry being knocked out by the butt end of a rifle

Jack wants to return fire, but hears Harry yelling in pain
and doesn't know where to shoot. Another blast right next

to him keeps him prone in the corner. He senses something

Jack comes crashing down into the elevator, lands hard.
The air is thick with shotgun smoke. The few lights not
shot out flicker. Jack looks up and is transfixed. He's
looking into...

THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN

He hears a voice out of the smoke.

FISK
| don't suppose anybody would pay
three million just for you.

Fisk chuckles. Then a loud, dull click. Another click.
The shotgun is empty.

JACK

Brings his gun up fast.

JACK
Drop it!
The gun drops. Through smoke and flickering light, Jack
gets a good |ook at Howard Fisk. Fisk is calm, his arm
around the still groggy Harry. In his hand is a deadman's
stick. His coat opens enough for us to see he has sticks

of dynamite roped around his chest.

FISK

Fisk drags Harry out. Jack doesn't know what to do.
Harry looks at Jack. He barely mouthes the words.

HARRY
Shoot the hostage.

Jack can't move. Fisk and Harry head toward swinging doors
that lead to the garage. Jack watches, gun trained on Fisk.

HARRY
Do it.

He shifts aim and BLASTS Harry in the leg. Harry goes down
and Fisk can't take him anywhere. Almost I aughing with
disbelief, Fisk lets go, starts running.

Jack starts shooting through the pipes and crates. One of
the shots grazes Fisk in the neck, spins him back to face
Jack. Even then, Fisk has this strange grin on his face.
FISK

STUMBLES through the doors.

JACK

Runs after him, reloading as he does...

Jack wakes up lying on top of his covers, wearing shorts
and a tee shirt. He looks much the worse for wear. The TV

slowly up and regards the TV with a bleary eye.

He looks up at the bomb. Fromhis P.0O.V. the bomb is so

He palms an exacto and carefully starts scraping away at
the green plastic covering.

The bus hits a tiny...

and Jack SLIPS, goes stock still as sweat drips down his
forehead. He looks at the knife. It has gone halfway

through the wire. Very, very slowly, he pulls it out

He scrapes some more at the sheath, revealing a silverish
wire: not copper.

the house in standard formation. They stop at the windows
by the garage. The venetian blinds are still down -- can't
see in.

Harry motions for two to go around the back. He takes
Robin around the side.

There is a door here. Robin is about to try the knob but
Harry GRABS her hand, shakes his head. He motions for her

He tries the window and it gives. It's clean, no wires.

Jack and Annie look at each other, almost laughing. They
look back at Mac as if to say, "Eh."

MCMAHON
Well maybe I'll let you have the
rest of the day off.

JACK

Oh. Mac, this is Annie. Annie,

MCMAHON

It's a slight awkward moment -- feels like introducing your
girlfriend to your dad.

Norwood runs up to Mac with a phone.

NORWOOD
It's him. He wants to know when
he's gonna get his money.

MCMAHON
(grabbing the phone)
That son of a bitch, I'll t

Realization blooms in Jack's face. He puts his hand over
Mac's.

JACK
He doesn't know it blew up.

McMahon pauses, stonefaced. He brings the phone to his ear.

MCMAHON
Twenty minutes.

CUT TO:
EXT. PERSHI NG SQUARE

The cops finalize their preparations. UNDERCOVER COPS move
here and there, signal to each other...

EXT. ROOF OF THE BILTMORE HOTEL

... Snipers take position.

EXT. NEAR PERSHING SQUARE - DAY

The ambulance pulls up, no lights or sirens. Jack gets
out. Other undercover police cars are nearby and cops rush
quietly to and fro.

INT. BARBERSHOP

McMahon is setting up his command post in a barbershop.

INT. THE AMBULANCE

Annie is just finished being patched up. She steps out of
the ambulance to watch Jack's receding figure, her face
etched with concern.

INT. FISK'S ROOM

He |ooks down on Pershing Square.

HIS P.O. V.

On the street, a garbage truck pulls up next to the can on
the northwest corner. A cop dressed as a garbageman gets
out, deposits two bags in the garbage, and drives on.

Fisk looks more carefully around the square. Again from
his P.O. V., WE CAN SEE:

A cop running behind a doorway a block away.
A sniper crouching low on a roof.

Fisk smiles, heads for the door. He stops at the TV that
shows Jack and the others on the still circling bus.

FI SK
It's too bad, Jack. You probably
would have made a good cop.
On the screen, Mrs. Kamino drops her purse.
There is a glitch. The purse is in her hands.

Fisk stares at the TV, eyes wide. A screamrises in his
throat but before it comes out we:

CUT TO:
EXT. PERSHI NG SQUARE
Jack, McMahon and Norwood look out froma storefront.
EXT. NEAR PERSHI NG SQUARE
Annie is standing by the ambulance, still looking in Jack's
general direction. Cops run to and fro, some keeping
pedestrians back.
A SWAT cop comes up to Annie.

CoP
Miss, we can't have you this
close, we need you to move back.

ANNI E
But Jack --

CoP
Officer Traven asked for you to be
brought out of harm's way. Let's
just move back.

Relenting, she turns to the cop. It's Howard Fisk. She
smiles as he leads her away.

EXT. PERSHING SQUARE - LATE

The can stands alone on the northeast corner.
INT. THE STOREFRONT

Jack is becoming increasingly agitated.

NORWOOD
He's running a little late.

Jack looks at his watch. 11:02.

JACK
He's not late.

MCMAHON
What ?

JACK
He's never late.

NORWOOD

That money hasn't moved. We've
got two hundred eyes on that can.
We've got a homing beacon in the
bags. He's covered.

JACK
Turn it on.

Jack bolts for the can.

MCMAHON
Jack!

CUT TO:
EXT. PERSHI NG SQUARE
Jack DASHES across the street. He runs to the garbage
cans, pushes them over. Below where the garbage can

stood, there's a jagged hole in the concrete, opening up
into a utility access tunnel

JACK
Son of a bitch --
INT. TUNNEL
Jack hang-drops down into the tunnel. He hears the sound
of hurrying footsteps down the tunnel. Jack pulls the gun

from his waistband and takes off after the sound.
FARTHER DOW THE TUNNEL. .

his Glock, draws a bead...

And she is very scared.

JACK

Incredul ous.

ANNIE

opens up the jacket she's wearing to reveal TEN POUNDS OF
C-4 strapped to her chest.

JACK
Christ.

An EMERGENCY DOOR on the side of the tunnel opens.
FISK
Steps out, holding a deadman stick.

FISK

Be prepared. That's the boy

ANNI E
I'm sorry, Jack.
FISK
What do you do, Jack. Can't shoot
her.
JACK
Let her go.
FISK

| don't think I'm gonna do that.
He has a bag, which he drops at Annie's feet.

Fill it.

disappointed, finding us right
back where we started.

JACK
Let her go! You got the money!
Take it and walk! You don't need
her!

FISK

You still don't understand, Jack.
The beauty of it. A bomb is made
to explode; that's its meaning,
its purpose. Your life is empty
because you spend it trying to
stop the bomb from becoming. And
for what? For who? You know what
a bomb is, Jack, that doesn't
explode? It's a cheap gold watch.

JACK
You're crazy.

Annie finishes filling the bag. Fisk takes it.

FISK
Poor people are crazy, Jack.
(hoisting the bag of

money)

I'm eccentric.

JACK
(one last time)
Let her go!

Fisk looks at Jack, almost fondly. Then he bolts through
a door with Annie, slamming it shut behind him.

Jack runs up to the door.
INT. THE TUNNEL

Jack tries the door. It's locked. he aims his gun and
blows the door handle to pieces. He tugs the door open and
light floods in

Jack steps through the door and is very surprised to find
himself in...

EXT. A SUBWAY STATI ON

He's on the upper level. Not many people around. Someone
runs up the stairs, looking frightened. jack down the
stairs.

INT. THE SUBWAY PLATFORM

People are shying away from Fisk and Annie as they make
their way along the platform. He has his gun out and she's
wearing bombs. People start getting off the subway,
heading for the stairs. Fisk pulls Annie onto the first
car.

INT. FIRST CAR

Three people, sitting. Smiles at one of them.

FISK
Is this seat taken?

Everyone clears off. All the cars are empty now as the
doors close and the train starts moving.

INT. PLATFORM

Jack runs down the stairs, yelling. Sprints along the
platform as the train starts pulling out of the station.
He jumps, just grabs the end of the fourth car.

INT. THE SUBWAY TRAIN

Fisk handcuffs Annie to a vertical handpole. He hands her
the deadman stick.

FISK
You don't want to drop this. I'm
counting on you.

He moves to the front of the car as the driver starts out
of the compartment.

DRI VER
What the hell is going --

( CONTI NUED)

CONTI NUED:

Fisk SHOOTS four times at point blank, sends him flying
back into the compartment. Two of the shots blast the
control panel. Annie cries out.

INT. THE SECOND CAR

Crouching, Jack is making his way to the first car, leaving
the connecting doors open as he goes. He peers into the
first car as Fisk finishes shooting, just in time to see
him retrieve the deadman's stick.

FISK

Smiles at Annie as he takes it.

FISK
Maybe | better hold this after
all. I'm afraid you're a little
hysterical and might let go a mite
early. It's not ‘cause you're a

woman.

He heads for the back and almost sees Jack. Wth nowhere
to go, Jack climbs on the top of the car. Fisk looks out
at the other cars.

FISK
Looks like we're all alone.
Nobody wanted this train.

ANNI E
You can let me go. You won, you
beat Jack, you beat everyone.
Throw me off the train, | don't
care. Only let me go.

He speaks to her softly.

FISK
This stick works on a remote.
See, when you explode, that's
where they'll come. But it's not
where I'll be. Mess like that,
they don't even count the body
parts. Gives me time.

He brushes hair from her face.

Pipes and concrete ceiling whips by Jack's head. He checks
his gun and a red conduit pipe RIPS it from his fingers.

FISK
Is that you, Jack?

He's persistent. He always gets

He grabs the bag of money, opens it. Looks up again.
FISK
Don't suppose you'd be interested
in a bribe, would you?
(chuckl es)
Got plenty to go around...
Inside the bag, a dye pack explodes.

Fisk looks down at his now useless money, some of the dye
dripping like blue shadows on his face. He SCREAMS

Still roaring, Fisk whips out his gun and pumps a round
into the ceiling.

He practically foaming at the mouth, hitting Jack with the
hand that holds the deadman's stick. Jack is helpless;
he's wounded and Fisk has the stick. He feebly tries to
defend himself.

Fisk is on his knees over Jack. He starts hitting Jack in
his arm wound. Jack nearly blacks out from pain.

FISK
What do you do, Jack? What do you
do? You're so smart! Right,
Jack? You little piece of shit!

JACK'S P.O. V.

Blurred, shifting. There is light on the ceiling. They're
tearing through another station.

Jack suddenly pulls back his leg and SLAMS it into Fisk's
solar plexus. Fisk flies back, standing straight up on his
knees and:

meets his face.

taking the stick before Fisk's body even hits the top of

JACK
Yeah, well, I'mtaller.

INT. TRAIN

Annie turns warily at the sound of a door sliding open.
Relief. It's Jack.

ANNI E
Fisk?

By way of reply, he holds the deadman's stick up, al most
smiling. Annie looks very relieved.

JACK
| ripped his head off.

He takes off her vest and defuses the C-4 and neutralizes
the deadman stick. Goes to the driver's compartment.

INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

Sparks. The equipment was shot to shit. Jack sees the
braking controls, flips the switches. Nothing. Grabs the
speed dial/lever and tries to pull it back toward the left
but it won't budge. It's jammed up. Pushes it forward --
the train goes FASTER. Tries the radio mike -- DEAD.

RUNS back into the passenger compartment.

C'mon, we gotta jump.

He stops. Her eyes are wet.

ANNI E
Jack, you have to get off.

No way. He looks up at the map. There's a big curve, then
dead end.

ANNI E
Jack, listen to me...the end of
this line is solid rock. You have

you! Go!

He |ooks at her.

JACK
Faster.

ANNI E

Jack...
Going to the driver's compartment.

JACK
The only way to stop this thing is
to make it go faster. There's a
curve up ahead. We go fast enough
we might jump the track, hit
something besides a dead end.

INT. THE DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT
Turns the knob hard right, comes back out...
ANNI E

This is bullshit, Jack. You have

He says nothing. Comes up to the pole she's at, holds on.
Braces himself. She falls silent as well. Drops her cuffs
around him. Holds himtight. They wait.

The train ROARS along the track...

Still under construction. At the end of the station the

Jarred by the rough ride. The lights flicker on and off.
Smoke from overheated engines rises into the car.
