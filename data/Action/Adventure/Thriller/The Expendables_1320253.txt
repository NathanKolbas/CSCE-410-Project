EXT. VAST OCEAN EXPANSE - NIGHT

The MOON and it’s vivid glow are seen rising in seamless time
lapse photography over the endless undulating body of water.

We hear an excerpt from THE CONGO by Vachel Lindsay.

VOICES
Boomlay, boomlay, boom.
Beware, walk with care,
Boomlay, boomlay, boom.
We are, we are all sinners,
Yet purer than sin.
Boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.’

EXT. GULF OF ADEN - NIGHT - (DISSOLVE INTO)

The MOONLIGHT reflects off the calm dark body of water. Way
in the distance FAINT LIGHTS on shore indicate a hint of the
PIRATE LAIR known as HARARDHERE. The outline of an anchored
25,000 ton CARGO SHIP (THE CHEMSTAR) is barely discernible.

EXT. CHEMSTAR —- NIGHT

A 25 FOOT POWER BOAT pulls along side the ship and FIFTEEN
ARMED PIRATES aggressively scramble up several HANGING ROPE
LADDERS.

POV PIRATES

All this action is seen through the lens of THERMAL NIGHT
VISION GOGGLES. Locked into the PIRATE'S ‘body heat
signature,’ the GOGGLES ramp in tighter on the THIEVES.

INT. SHIP - NIGHT

The heavy DOOR to a large unit STORAGE ROOM swings open
revealing the kidnapped crew. They are thoroughly exhausted
and suffering from dehydration.

In very tight unsteady angles we see glimpses of the SOMALIAN
PIRATES charging into the room and yanking hostages to their
feet. Some are savagely kicked and jerked upright by KNOTTED
ROPES that are wrapped around their necks. They plead for
mercy through their GAGS.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 2

SHIP’S STAIRCASE

The DARK METAL STAIRCASE reverberates loudly as frenetic
SHAFTS OF LIGHT from the PIRATES’ FLASHLIGHTS cut through the
gloom as the BOUND HOSTAGES are kicked and shoved down toward
the bowels of the ship.

EXT. - SHIP

The only sound heard is the LAPPING WAVES that strike the
ship’s side. The TETHERED PIRATES’ BOAT is seen in the
foreground again, through THERMAL VISION GOGGLES, the
‘Thermal Vision POV’ moves steadily closer.

INT. - SHIP

The BOUND HOSTAGES are being shoved and kicked into the
center of the ship’s HOLD. High above the HOLD are open CARGO
DOORS that reveal the dark night sky. TWO PIRATES stand guard
above the ‘HOLD’ watching the HOSTAGES being abused below.
Waiting in the hold are another FIFTEEN PIRATES who are
sitting on STACKS OF CARGO drinking and smoking. The whole
environment has the feel of a distorted amphitheater whose
attendees want blood.

SHIP’S HOLD

The HOSTAGES are dragged into the center of the METAL CARGO
AREA. The PIRATES mock their pleas for ‘help’ and burning
CIGARETTES and empty BEER BOTTLES are tossed at the FRENCH
MEN. The surly PIRATES pass around large joints of MARIJUANA,
while gyrating on the STACKED CARGO.

SHIPS UPPER DECK

Ultra Extreme CLOSE UP of a THERMAL VISION GOGGLES LENS as it
rises into view. The individual wearing them is not seen.
THERMAL VISION POV

Panning around we see the DECK is clear. The THERMAL VISION
then scans the UPPER DECK of the ship and this area is also
clear.

The THERMAL VISION IMAGE now travels forward toward the CARGO

HOLD. A PIRATE GUARD seated on the EDGE of the cargo hold is
observing below.

SHIP’S HOLD

The PIRATE LEADER bellows orders and the PIRATE CREW kick the
HOSTAGES to their knees, while dragging them into a straight
line. The majority of the surrounding PIRATES hurl insults.
The LEADER orders another PIRATE holding a small VIDEO CAMERA
to begin filming. Around them are STACKS of the cargo, which
is SALT.

The LEADER paces behind the doomed HOSTAGES and begins to
speak in English, which is the SOMALI’S second language.

LEADER

(accented English)
We had these men too long! Three
months! Too, too long! Now someone
here

(eyes the hostages)
has to pay! Your company has had so
much time to pay! But you give
nothing!! You do not care about
your people. Don’t want them? Then
we do not care!

 

The LEADER angrily gestures to the PIRATE beside him.

The PIRATE disdainfully drags a HOSTAGE forward and yanks his
bound hands upward.

The GAGGED HOSTAGE’S muffled cries for mercy fall on deaf
ears. The PIRATE GANG clamors for blood.

LEADER
(playing to the camera)
These workers need their hands! But
the owners of this ship do not want
to pay! That means to me that you
do not care for these men anymore.
We do not care too.

SHIP’S DECK

The THERMAL VISION POV continues to close in on the edge of
the CARGO HOLD.

INT. — CARGO HOLD

The PIRATE LEADER has stepped in front of the cowering
HOSTAGE.

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 4

LEADER
(outraged)
The blood they bleed is for you to
see!

The LEADER raises a huge MACHETE from another PIRATE.

SHIP’S HOLD

The MACHETE is about to descend when they are startled by a
yell followed by a BLACK NYLON BAG that crashes heavily to
the ship’s floor.

Full of adrenaline, the PIRATES aim their array of WEAPONS
upward and are about to fire when the RED BEAM from a LASER
LIGHT appears on the LEADER’S CHEST.

LEADER
(to his men)
No!
(in Somali)
Don’t shoot!! Who is there?

The PIRATE with the PORTABLE CAMERA pans upward. It records
the barely discernible OUTLINES of SIX DARKLY CLAD MEN. (This
camera’s footage will be haphazardly recorded and used in a
later scene.)

EXT. SHIP’S DECK - NIGHT

The SIX MERCENARIES gathered around the ship’s HOLD are known
as THE EXPENDABLES.

BARNEY ROSS: Group leader and strategist. In his day a record
holder for his blinding speed and accuracy with COMBAT
PISTOLS.

HALE CAESAR: Long Barrel Weapon Specialist, especially
custom, one of a kind, full-auto shotguns. Well-adjusted,
pleasant, outspoken, but ruthless in battle, friends with
BARNEY for 10 years.

LEE CHRISTMAS: Former SAS and a savant with anything that has
a blade.

YING YANG: Thoughtful, deadly and a master at ‘close quarter
combat.’ He’s a man who’s always meditating on how he should
live his life.

TOLL ROAD: His imposing size and battle scarred appearance
belie his special DEMOLITION SKILLS and calm intellect.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 5

When all else fails, he simply employs his brutal but
brilliant fighting capabilities to shatter every bone in an
opponent’s body. He wears special GLOVES with protruding
STUDS and METAL KNEE PADS.

GUNNAR JENSEN: A big combat veteran who’s an expert in
PRECISION SNIPING, but the years of stress, isolation and
cynicism have spiraled him downwards into an unwinnable war
of substance abuse and untamable mood swings.

All of these men possess a matching EXPENDABLES LOGO TATTOO.

YANG

has a LASER DOT from his rifle centered on the LEADER’S
CHEST, as BARNEY addresses the THIEF.

BARNEY
There’s the money - Free the
hostages.

Unimpressed, the PIRATE LEADER looks at the LASER DOT on his
chest, then runs his fingers through the BEAM. He motions to
another PIRATE who retrieves the BAG. The LEADER looks
inside.

LEADER
(hard)
How much in there?

BARNEY
Three million.

LEADER
You wait too long! Now it’s five!!

BARNEY
Last time - Free the hostages.

LEADER
Five million!!

Wired to the gills, GUNNAR barges forward roughly shoving
YANG aside.

GUNNAR
Move!

CHRISTMAS
What the hell ya doin’?

GUNNAR looks at Barney, eyes glazed. He raises his powerful
RIFLE.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 6

LEADER
We want our money! Now!

GUNNAR
- Warnin’ shot!!

BARNEY
No!!

GUNNAR pulls the trigger sending a heavy grained bullet into
center of the LEADER'S face.

The film goes into SLOW MOTION. The PIRATE LEADER’S head is
completely gone. The stunned PIRATES stare in horror as the
LEADER’S body still remains upright. The EXPENDABLES exchange
anxious looks. They know the scene is milliseconds away from
chaos.

GUNNAR
(simply)
..-Little low.

With that the PIRATE LEADER’S body crumbles to a heap and the
battle is on!

CHRISTMAS and HALE CAESAR toss TWO M-18 SMOKE GRENADES from
above and the Room is instantly enveloped into a billowing
hell as the PIRATE’S gunfire ricochet everywhere.

HOSTAGES duck against the wall seeking safety.

BARNEY
No firing till you’re down!

CHRISTMAS and YANG leap over the side and rappel into the
billowing SMOKE.

HALE CAESAR
(to Gunnar)
Get the exit.

GUNNAR
Who made you God?

GUNNAR takes off as TOLL ROAD and BARNEY quickly rappel over
the side into the thickening protective smoke.

TWO PIRATES come charging up the stairs, out of the smoke
HALE CAESAR appears at the top of the stairs, his shotgun
leveled.

BOOOM!

He blows both pirates into chop meat.

Another PIRATE is fleeing up the steel steps and is blasted
back by HALE CAESAR. Through the fading HAZE of the grenade
smoke, HALE CAESAR moves into the BOWELS of the SHIP’S HOLD.
GUNNAR steps into view, his wild eyes craving the battle.

YING YANG

He leaps out from behind a CARGO STACK and catches a PIRATE
with a savage kick from his STEEL TIPPED BOOTS, then sprays a
SECOND PIRATE with his MACHINE GUN.

PIRATES

In the shadowy ‘hold,’ the PIRATES are panicking and firing
wildly. BULLETS ricochet off the SHIP’S STEEL SIDE with
deafening reverberations.

HALE CAESAR is hit in the PROTECTIVE VEST. He fires his SEGA
SHOTGUN and obliterates STACKS of CARGO that the assaulting
PIRATE hides behind.

CHRISTMAS

leaps from cover and heaves a KNIFE at a PIRATE who is
reloading, then fires his WEAPON three times at a PIRATE who
dives safely behind a CARGO STACK. The PIRATE now fires at
BARNEY. TOLL ROAD suddenly appears behind the PIRATE and
snaps his NECK.

BARNEY ROSS

BARNEY ducks then spins out and with amazing economy he fires
off eight shots with his .45, hitting TWO ARMED PIRATES,
then, speed loads and fires off SIX more at another PIRATE
sprinting to an ambush location in less than 3 seconds. The
PIRATE is blown off his feet.

YANG

steps from his concealment and kicks one PIRATE with his
STEEL TIPPED BOOTS and blows two more away as he rolls to
safety.

CHRISTMAS

cuts down THREE PIRATES who fire from the top of CARGO
STACKS.

GUNNAR

Without any regard for his own safety, he walks insanely
forward as a pair of PIRATE’S BULLETS tear off the STACKED
CARGO near his head. He blasts the PIRATE away with his HUGE
PISTOL.

CHRISTMAS

is out of AMMO, but sees TWO PIRATES and with insane speed,
he whips out a pair of THROWING KNIVES and impales the
thieves. A THIRD PIRATE tries to behead him from behind with
a MACHETE. CHRISTMAS dodges the blow and crushes the man’s
THROAT with a lethal blow.

PIRATE

drops his empty WEAPON and whips out his MACHETE and
anxiously moves forward.

TOLL ROAD

A STUDDED FIST slams into the PIRATE’S CHEST. The man
attempts to raise the MACHETE, but TOLL ROAD grabs the man
behind his NECK, and crushes the PIRATE’S HEAD against his
STUDDED KNEE, and blows another PIRATE away with his
REMINGTON MODEL 870 MCS ‘breach weapon.’

BARNEY

swings around a CARGO STACK and catches TWO PIRATES broadside
with his .45.

GUNNAR’S

Drugged eyes are as wide as portholes as he snaps around the
corner and catches CHRISTMAS dead in his sights. Though ten
feet away, GUNNAR is aiming right between his teammate’s
eyes.

CHRISTMAS
What’re you doing?!

GUNNAR fires missing CHRISTMAS’ HEAD by an inch, but catching
a PIRATE, who is taking aim twenty feet away. CHRISTMAS
glares at GUNNAR and rapidly moves off.

CHRISTMAS
(low)
Crazy bastard!

GUNNAR sees a PIRATE behind BARNEY and blows him away.
Turning, he finds himself face to face with a LONG HAIRED
PIRATE who shoots him point blank in the CHEST. GUNNAR
recoils, then with incredible rage, fights the pain and with
python-like speed, grabs the LONG HAIRED PIRATE by the
throat.
GUNNAR

Got ya!
CHRISTMAS
Heaves another KNIFE at a PIRATE who runs between the CARGO
STACKS.
HALE CAESAR
sees ANOTHER PIRATE fleeing up the steps and fires twice. The
PIRATE tumbles down the stairs.
SHIP’S HOLD

From above we see the majority of the smoke has funneled out.

PIRATES

THREE PIRATES dash to a new location while shooting wildly at
BARNEY.

YANG

suddenly leaps into view, kicking one in the gut, the other
across the jaw, and plugs the third with his PISTOL.

TOLL ROAD

His thick hand lashes out and seizes a PIRATE by the throat
who is firing at CHRISTMAS. He heaves him forward, back hands

another PIRATE with is SHOTGUN then fires his weapon at
another PIRATE who ducks to safety.
25A

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 10

HALE CAESAR

approaches from the opposite direction and drives his ELBOW
squarely into his FOREHEAD, then pulling out a huge dagger-
like KNIFE aptly called ‘The Arkansas Toothpick,’ parries
another PIRATE’S MACHETE and with a stupendous elbow to the
forehead, crushes him to the SHIP’S FLOOR.

CHRISTMAS

Clearing his way around the CARGO, he sees EIGHT PIRATES
snatch up the BOUND HOSTAGES, using them as a shield. A very
tall PIRATE has one of the hostages by the hair, a KNIFE at
his throat.

TALL PIRATE
(insanely)
We kill them! We kill them!

BARNEY sees what CHRISTMAS sees. HALE CAESAR drifts into view
and blocking the steps, likewise TOLL ROAD, YANG joins in
from the opposite angle. They are all blocking the stairway
EXIT.

TALL PIRATE
Drop the weapons!

The PIRATES have weapons pointed at the HOSTAGES’ heads. The
MERCENARIES look toward BARNEY, who remains stone faced.

TALL PIRATE
We kill them all! I don’t care!

BARNEY lowers his PISTOLS to the ground, likewise the TWO
OTHER MEN. While rising, he glances at CHRISTMAS, who has
also lowered his COMPACT RIFLE.

CHRISTMAS
Got the four on the left.

BARNEY
(secretly to Christmas)
Take the two on the right, I got
the rest.

CHRISTMAS never removes his eyes from the PIRATE LEADER.
CHRISTMAS
(low)
...You’re not that fast anymore.

BARNEY
Only thing faster is light.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 11

PIRATE
Bring the money here now!

The MONEY rests near HALE CAESAR. He eyes BARNEY.

HALE CAESAR
(eyeing the pirate)
...-Boomlay, boom.

A fellow pirate starts forward.

TALL PIRATE
(in Somalian)
Kill them -

Like a blur BARNEY quick-draws a custom built SIX SHOOTER
from the small of his back as CHRISTMAS’ whips out TWO
THROWING KNIVES hidden behind his shoulders with blinding
speed, then whips out TWO MORE fastened to either side of his
leg. It’s hard to tell which is faster, BARNEY’S BULLETS or
CHRISTMAS’ KNIVES, but EIGHT DEAD PIRATES hit the ground.
Stone-faced BARNEY moves forward and begins cutting the
HOSTAGES loose.

CHRISTMAS
(teasingly)
Call it a tie.

TOLL ROAD
(to Christmas and Barney)
Call it narcissistic.

YANG
This place smells, let’s go!

ONE HOSTAGE begins to profusely thank BARNEY. BARNEY'S
unimpressed.

CHRISTMAS’ attention is drawn upward.

CHRISTMAS
What the hell is he doin’?!

Overhead is GUNNAR, wrapping the repelling rope around the
semi-conscious LONG HAIRED PIRATE’S neck.

BARNEY
Whatta ya doin’?

GUNNAR
I’m killin’ killers!

BARNEY
Let ‘im go!

This is no good.
(sprints away)

EXT. SHIP’S HOLD

GUNNAR continues to wrap the repelling rope around the LONG
HAIRED PIRATE’S neck.

GUNNAR
(tying the knot)
You hang pirates!

GUNNAR yanks the PIRATE upright and turns him face forward,
like a man on a gallows.

GUNNAR
They’d do it to us!!

CHRISTMAS
(to Barney)
Put one in his leg.

BARNEY takes aim as GUNNAR prepares to shove the PIRATE over
the CARGO HOLD LEDGE when he is blind-sided by a arcing KICK
from YANG that staggers him sideways.

GUNNAR and YANG

YANG squares off against GUNNAR, who’s eyes fill with rage as
he charges YANG.

BARNEY AND CHRISTMAS

observe what just transpired and rush toward the staircase.

GUNNAR

Attacks YANG who lands a crushing KICK to the knee and a KICK
to the eye that splits the big man’s BROW open.

With startling speed, GUNNAR parries YANG’S next blow, then
seizing him by the throat, smashes him to the ground.
Instantly there’s a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE pressed against YANG’S
throat. BLOOD streams along the side of GUNNAR’S face.

GUNNAR
(hard)
You’re on my team?
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 13
YANG
We don’t kill like that.

GUNNAR
I do.

GUNNAR tips the shiny blade and studies his distorted
reflection. A PISTOL is jammed against the back of his head.
He sees BARNEY in the reflection.
BARNEY
Back off.

GUNNAR holds fast, never taking his eyes off YANG.

 

GUNNAR
Bastard kicked me.

CHRISTMAS
You deserved it.

GUNNAR
Think I‘1l need stitches.

BARNEY
Yeah - Let ‘im go.

GUNNAR
(low)
Sure, after I pull out his throat.

Suddenly YANG slams a knee into GUNNAR’S GROIN and sweeps the
razor sharp BLADE away from his throat, then leaps to his
feet.

GUNNAR prepares to likewise leap up, only to find BARNEY
jamming a PISTOL BARREL against his forehead. YANG moves to
attack, but is stopped by HALE CAESAR.

YANG
We don’t kill people who can’t
fight back!

GUNNAR
(out of it)
Bad karma is it?

CHRISTMAS reaches into GUNNAR’S pocket and pulls out a SMALL
PLASTIC CELLOPHANE POUCH of METH and smells it.

CHRISTMAS
Meth. (to Barney) Tenth time.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 14

BARNEY takes the METH BAG from CHRISTMAS as GUNNAR rises.

GUNNAR
Bad habit.

HALE CAESAR
Very bad, Brother.

GUNNAR *
(to Barney)
Who's perfect? *

He looks over to Barney, whose face registers the pain of
compassion stretched too far for too long.

BARNEY
Give Christmas the knife - Do it.
GUNNAR stiffens.

CHRISTMAS
...Jdust for a while. *

Reluctantly GUNNAR hangs over the massive weapon.

GUNNAR
-..One of a kind. *

BARNEY
Gunnar, you’re done with us.

GUNNAR looks defeated, confused. He looks at the other
EXPENDABLES for support.

GUNNAR
Done?

BARNEY
You’re no good to us anymore.

GUNNAR
(hard)
That right?

CHRISTMAS
You got skills. There’s always
gonna be somethin’ out there.

GUNNAR
(to Barney)
No more chances? *

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 15

YANG
You’ve had many chances.

Gunnar turns to Barney, rage and hurt mingling in his tweaked
out face.

GUNNAR
Fifteen years.
(to Toll Road)
Cuff me before I kill somebody. I
mean it - Do it -

Barney nods. TOLL ROAD fastens a PAIR of PLASTIC CUFFS around
GUNNAR’S wrists.

TOLL ROAD
Sorry, Brother.

At this moment the LONG HAIRED PIRATE begins to regain
consciousness and weakly removes the ROPE from around his
neck.

GUNNAR kicks out his LEG catching the degenerate PIRATE
flush, thus sending him over the edge of the CARGO HOLD.

CHRISTMAS moves with unbelievable speed, and taking GUNNAR’S
BOWIE KNIFE, slashes the rope around the falling PIRATE’S
neck in half before it snaps taunt. The PIRATE crashes
unconsciously on a STACK OF CARGO.

GUNNAR
.+.They would've done it to us.

OVER CREDITS

EXT. NIGHT TIME SKY

Barney’s sea plane cruises through the starlit sky.

INT. BARNEY’S SEA PLANE - NIGHT (CREDIT SEQUENCE)

The EXPENDABLES are all in their own space. Barney is at the
controls, stares straight ahead. CHRISTMAS sits in the co-
pilot seat. YANG sits deep in meditation. HALE CAESAR reads a
book. TOLL ROAD, wearing GLASSES, reads a self help BOOK.
GUNNAR sits in the rear with his hands bound. CHRISTMAS rises
and gives GUNNAR water, then cuts him loose. CHRISTMAS then
hands him his huge KNIFE and SHEATH.

GUNNAR
Keep it - You appreciate a good

hands.

EXT. LACY’S HOME - NIGHT

CHRISTMAS arrives on a DUCATI MOTORCYCLE. He removes a bottle
of CHAMPAGNE from inside his jacket, but pauses when he sees
a tricked out RANGE ROVER in the driveway and starts up the
stairs.

EXT. LACY’S HOME - NIGHT

CHRISTMAS moves up the steps to the porch, flicks a familiar
WIND CHIME, then tries to open the SCREEN DOOR. It’s locked.
He rings the bell, and the outline of a woman appears on the
other side of a frosted glass door.

LACY
Who is it?

CHRISTMAS
‘,..Someday you’1l find a man who
will be happy just to watch you
sleep.’

There’s an unsettling pause on the other side of the door.

LACY
Lee?

CHRISTMAS
Yeah. Who else?

The frosted door opens a crack and LACY appears. She’s in her
early 30's. She’s a good soul, attractive in a very natural
way. She unlocks the SCREEN DOOR.

LACY
(low)
I didn’t know you were back.

CHRISTMAS
Just arrived - Who’s truck’s that?

LACY
(awkwardly)

CHRISTMAS stiffens and leans into the doorway.

In the background, PAUL, a physically strong, mid 30’s, clean-
cut MAN steps into view wearing long pants and a white T-
shirt. Aggressive jock written all over him.

PAUL
..-Everything alright? Who’re you?

LACY
(low)
He’s a friend.
The word ‘friend’ sinks Lee’s heart.

PAUL
What’s up?

He locks eyes with CHRISTMAS. For a man who is a natural
fighting machine, the fight seems to drain from his body.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 18

Leaning against the railing, he gently places the BOTTLE OF
CHAMPAGNE on the ground...

PAUL
Kinda late - Your name is what?

CHRISTMAS

What’s it matter -

PAUL tenses and starts to drift forward.

PAUL
Got a problem?

LACY
Please, give me a minute.

Yeah, a minute.

PAUL reluctantly backs away. LACY steps outside and stands
directly behind the crestfallen man.

CLOSE ON

A TATTOO NEEDLE APPLYING INK TO A SHOULDER. The retro music
leaks from a small CD machine.

PULL BACK TO

INT. TOOL’S TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT

BARNEY sits in a CLASSIC OLD SCHOOL TATTOO PARLOR. There are
TWO OTHER VACANT STATIONS. He studies the OLD TATTOO PRINTS
on the wall and eyes several PHOTOGRAPHS of himself taken a
year earlier in Special Forces combat fatigues, standing next
to TOOL in some exotic hellhole.

The cavernous sound of an approaching MOTORCYCLE intensifies.
As BARNEY turns toward the rumbling, we see the glowing
HEADLIGHTS of a HARLEY MOTORCYCLE. The PLAIN LOOKING CHOPPER
enters through a METAL DOOR, gliding through dim light. It
travels towards BARNEY, finally pausing near a small FREIGHT
ELEVATOR. Stepping off the bike is TOOL and an attractive
FEMALE COMPANION. The room is full of BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED
MOTORCYCLES.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 21

TOOL’S

body is completely covered in INK IMAGES. He is dressed in
LEATHER PANTS, LEATHER VEST while an abundance of SILVER

‘EXPENDABLE’ only goes to the letter '‘D.’

TOOL

37B EXT. CHURCH - DAY

We see the modest exterior of a non-denominational CHURCH in

of the structure.

You can call me Mr. Church - It’s
not my real name.

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 26

INT. — CHURCH - DAY

Sitting in the PEW is a man known only as CHURCH. He is all
business. Hard in mind and soul. Fear and subtly is alien to
this individual. His eyes belong in the skull of a predator.

CHURCH
But you don’t need to know my real
name, just like I don’t need or
want to know your real name.

BARNEY
Then what do you want to know?

CHURCH
That you can deliver. Have you ever
heard of Vilena?

BARNEY
No.

CHURCH
A dirt patch of an island in the
Gulf. There are certain resources
on Vilena - The interests I
represent want to invest a large
sum of money on this island.
Following this?

BARNEY
...Yeah.

CHURCH
(tense)
You look bored.

BARNEY
It’s my bone structure.

CHURCH
(removes his sunglasses)
Let’s take off our glasses.

BARNEY
Why?

CHURCH
It’s more honest - You know what I
mean.

CHURCH’S eyes bore into BARNEY’S trying to get a read on
where he’s coming from.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 27

CHURCH
Much better - The President of the
country, General Ruben Garza,
overthrew the government and for
the past year or so, his death
squads have decimated the
population - He even had two of our
company’s soil researchers killed,
we're told he was in on the
execution.

He hands a PICTURE over from a FOLDER.

BARNEY studies the PHOTO. This one of a tin pot despot of a
man, in an over medaled uniform, his eyes hold the hint of
madness.

CHURCH
(pushing the drama)
That’s Garza. His so-called ‘Red
Guards’ kill unarmed woman and
children without thinking twice.

BARNEY
(unaffected)
...Yeah.
CHURCH
You have any children? Mr. Ross?
CHURCH
I relate.
BARNEY

I got a truck and a seaplane.

CHURCH
Right - Anyway, the majority of the
people go hungry while -

BARNEY

Let me stop you, what people eat
isn’t my concern, what they pay is.

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 28

CHURCH (cont'd)
The people I represent won’t do
business with a government that
could collapse in a few years or
one that could become more radical.

CHURCH stares straight into BARNEY’S eyes. He hands over a
FOLDER.

CHURCH
More details - And we have arranged
a contact - A well financed
mercenary operation could succeed.

BARNEY
You’re wasting my time. What d’you
want?

CHURCH

together)
I don’t like your attitude.

BARNEY

Yes, dead. His soldiers dead. His

Barney heads back to his truck. Once inside, he takes out a
MINIATURE VIDEO CAMERA and withdrawing the MEMORY CHIP, puts
it into the PC on the seat beside him. Hitting the play
button, he studies the CLOSE-UP FOOTAGE of CHURCH requesting
he attack the island of VILENA. Having seen enough, he closes
the LAPTOP and the scene goes black.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE (VILENA) - NIGHT

The PALACE is old and solid, and has a forboding aura. Large
LIGHTS shine down from the BARBED WIRED walls that surround
this horrible structure.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL POOL BALCONY - NIGHT

GENERAL GARZA, a hefty paranoid, with a volatile personality,
stares at a beautiful POOL that lies below him.

RED BERET
General!

INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT

GARZA, still in his bathrobe, comes striding through the
dimly lit, EERIE TUNNELS, followed by his ELITE GUARDS. On
either side in small cave like cells, peasant workers are
engaged in unloading WHITE POWDER bricks and placing them in
stacks on wooden pallets.

GARZA comes upon more of his guards surrounding a trembling
PEASANT WORKER and his exhausted, small, mid-thirties WIFE
and 15 YR OLD SON. One of the guards holds a SMALL PLASTIC
BAG of the white powder, which he hands to GARZA, who regards
it calmly.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 30

The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps off a steady stream of STILL SHOTS.
Garza comes face to face with the terror stricken peasant.
All dialogue is in SPANISH.

GENERAL GARZA
(calmly in Spanish)
Did you steal from me?

PRISONER
No. Please Excellency. I would
never steal from you! Never!

GENERAL GARZA
(in Spanish)
Everything that comes out of the
ground is not yours, it’s mine. You
know that, yes?

PRISONER
I swear on the lives of my
children!

GENERAL GARZA
(in Spanish)
I understand, but if I can’t see
inside of you - How do I know if
you’re telling the truth?

And then, suddenly....
BOOM!

From out of the darkness comes a bone jarring explosion that
causes ALL present to jump out of their skins.

From the shadows emerges an American, JAMES MONROE, a rouge
CIA Officer in his 40’s. His hair is slicked back, his
demeanor calm, but in his eyes the blackness that inspires
fear. Backing him up are three lethal looking Americans,
Blackwater types. PAINE, and his TWO EX-AMERICAN OPERATIVES.
In Monroe’s hand, a Desert Eagle, smoke still curling from
the barrel.

MONROE
Now you can see ‘inside him,’ and I
see lies.

Garza, looks from the dead man to Monroe, annoyed.
MONROE moves off followed by PAINE and the TWO AMERICAN
OPERATIVES. The loyal RED BERET GUARDS stare hard at the
departing AMERICAN.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 31

.--And he wasn’t stealing from you,

Garza looks after them, rattled, frustrated, has a hard time
meeting his own private guard’s dour expression.

When you want them gone, General?

GARZA

Take care of this.

SOLDIERS wear the DARK RED BERETS signifying that they are
part of GARZA’S BRUTAL ELITE TROOPS.

The country’s new FLAG (an image of GENERAL GARZA) flies from

the majority of his face is a void as if to indicate his soul
is hollow.

The DOOR opens and MONROE enters followed by PAINE. THREE
loyal RED BERET GUARDS glare at them.

MONROE
Morning, General.
(dryly)
Let’s take a ride.

GARZA
When I finish.

MONROE
That’d be now.

MONROE exits.

PAINE
(to staring guards)
...See something.

With thinly concealed disdain, the GUARDS turn away as PAINE
also exits. GARZA can not match the gaze of his frustrated
SOLDIERS as he passes.

EXT. SANDRA’S PICK UP TRUCK - DAY

Dust kicks up from the partially paved road as SANDRA drives
her terribly rundown mini PICKUP TRUCK towards the outskirts
of town.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 47

On the visor are SIX SMALL SKILLFULLY SKETCHED PORTRAITS of
local women. One in particular stands out. A WOMAN’S WINGED

PORTRAIT.
SANDRA
How long you stay?
BARNEY
One day.
SANDRA
Come and go, just like all the *
rest. *

SANDRA sees BARNEY eyeing her ARTWORK.

BARNEY
...You do these?
SANDRA
Yes - Take one - a gift.
BARNEY
I don’t take free gifts - How much *
do you want? *
SANDRA
Nothin’. Takin’ money for *

SANDRA pulls it down and hands it to him.

SANDRA

Reluctantly, Barney takes the WINGED WOMAN’S HEAD from SANDRA
and puts it in his pocket.

66 INT. SANDRA’S PICK UP TRUCK - DAY

SANDRA drives while BARNEY sits in the middle and CHRISTMAS
rides shotgun.

SANDRA
So what’re you doing here? *

CHRISTMAS
Studying birds.

SANDRA
Really?
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 48

CHRISTMAS
Yeah, studying birds that know how
to survive, they sense when things
are gonna change and just fly away.

BARNEY glances at him like he’s lost his mind.

BARNEY
So how close can you get to the
palace?

SANDRA
Why?

BARNEY

To see the view.

SANDRA
There’s no view.

BARNEY
Like to see it anyway.

66A EXT. EMPTY FIELD - DAY

Monroe stares at an unplanted field, with peasants lazily
turning the soil. His mood is black. He turns to Garza. Who
is uncomfortable. Paine, and OPERATIVE #2 AND #3 stand off to
the side, eyeing several of Garza’s Red Berets.

MONROE
Where’s the growth? Where’s the
manpower?

GARZA
People are getting weak.

MONROE
Do you know how long it takes a
coca plant to produce? Two months
“ago!” We’re eight weeks behind
schedule. Kick your peasants’
asses, I need my product!

GARZA
When you talk this way to me in
front of my men - It’s not good.

MONROE closes to within inches of GARZA’S face.

SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 49

MONROE

(quietly)
You're right, it’s embarrassing -
Listen closely - I am the life
line. I am the coordinator of all
this confusion. I’m making you
rich. Through my network, my
contacts, and being wealthy is very
good because it allows people to be
the real ‘ass wipes’ nature
intended them to be - No more
faking it, but if you want me gone,
shoot me, if you want ongoing
wealth, grow thicker skin and get
me my product.

The fire in Monroe’s eyes burns into Garza.

GARZA
(hard)
This is not worth the money.

MONROE smiles, backs off.

MONROE
Sure it is.

He stalks off, with his men following. Garza takes a deep
breath, tries to regain his composure.

OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY

BARNEY, CHRISTMAS and SANDRA ride in SANDRA’S MINI-PICKUP
TRUCK. They rock uncomfortably down a pot-holed road. The
extreme poverty affects BARNEY.

A group of SOLDIERS in RED BERETS have pinned several YOUNG
MEN against a wall. They are being roughly interrogated, then
shoved into MILITARY TRUCKS.

CHRISTMAS
It like this all the time?

BARNEY looks out the window as their VEHICLE passes filthy,
bare footed CHILDREN carrying BUCKETS of brackish water and
joyless adults clad in near thread bare RAGS slump against
crumbling HOUSE/SHACKS.

SANDRA
(dryly)
Yes, all the time. This place, this
place you see now - was a beautiful
place.
(MORE )
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 50

SANDRA (cont'd)
Then one day, they came with money
and General Garza sells his soul,
now you have a dying place.

CHRISTMAS
You said ‘came with money.’ Who?

SANDRA
Some Americans - That’s all I know -
But all this will change back.

BARNEY
You believe that? *
SANDRA
Yes, and the best day of our lives *
will be the one when we can say our *
lives are going to be our own *
again. *
CHRISTMAS *
Nice thought. *
BARNEY studies her committed expression.
BARNEY
You have family?
SANDRA
My mother died long ago - My father
- He died too - You have family?
CHRISTMAS
He has a truck an’ a seaplane.
BARNEY
If I were you I’d think about
leavin’.
SANDRA
Why? It’s my country.
BARNEY
Look around.
SANDRA
I don’t understand.
BARNEY
You said it was dyin’. *
SANDRA

But it’s not dead!
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09

SANDRA'S mood darkens.

CHRISTMAS

(to Barney)
Gettin’ kinda bleak.

(to Sandra)
Sometimes trying to be helpful,
comes out wrong. Sandra, I was
wonderin’ about somethin’ from,
say, a female point of view.

SANDRA does not understand.

BARNEY
What’re you doing?

CHRISTMAS
Conversing - Look it up.

BARNEY
Be focused.

CHRISTMAS
Be flexible.
(to Sandra)
Outta curiosity, ever have a person
you, ah, say liked, or more, ask
you to like get lost?

SANDRA
Get lost?

CHRISTMAS
Y'know, go away, leave, not be with
‘em anymore.

BARNEY
Focus.

CHRISTMAS
Chill -
(to Sandra)
Did it make you feel bad about
yourself?

SANDRA
Bad...Yes.

BARNEY shakes his head.

CHRISTMAS
But we’re not bad people -
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 52

BARNEY
A little dignity.

CHRISTMAS

Please -
(to Sandra)

Makes you wonder, is it us or them
who’s messed up? I mean could a bad
person ever say something like:
‘Tienes que encontrar un hombre que
siempre se quedara despierto solo
para verte dormir.’

SANDRA
(touched)
That’s nice.

BARNEY
What'd Little Boy Blue say?

SANDRA
‘Someday I will find a man who will
be happy just to watch me sleep.’

BARNEY
Hopeless.

CHRISTMAS
Hopeless? ‘Cause I’m trying to
connect with people’ - Try it

sometime - I mean, why the hell are
we in this world anyway! Look who
I’m talkin’ to.

(to Sandra)
We close?

SANDRA
It’s just over there.

CHRISTMAS
Pull over, please.

SANDRA pulls over and CHRISTMAS steps out.

SANDRA
Anything wrong?

CHRISTMAS
Nothin’, we just like to look at

You have a black heart.

He moves off.

BARNEY and SANDRA stand beside a BERM along the barely
discernible dirt road.

SANDRA
Why’re you looking here?

BARNEY walks off the road and looks at the PALACE in the
distance.

SANDRA is extremely uncomfortable.

SANDRA
Who're you really?
BARNEY
Birdwatcher.
SANDRA
I know you’re not what you say you

BARNEY
And who're you?
SANDRA
I told you my name.
BARNEY
You settin’ us up?
SANDRA
What does ‘settin’ up’ mean?
BARNEY
You don’t look like you belong in

SANDRA

A man came here - He asked a friend
to show you what you want. He was
afraid so he asked me too.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 54

BARNEY
You’re not afraid.
SANDRA
Yes...But he said you may help - We

should go.

Suddenly they’re alerted by the GROANING ENGINE of a large
MILITARY TRUCK that quickly pulls into view. TEN ANGRY
SOLDIERS wearing RED BERETS pile out.

SANDRA
Oh, God, please don’t say anything -
Let me talk.

LEADER
(in Spanish)
What’re you doing here? Stay where
you are!

The TEN SOLDIERS surround BARNEY and SANDRA, WEAPONS held
waist high.

LEADER
(in Spanish)
You were told never to come close.

SANDRA
(in Spanish)
Why? You don’t own this place.
Should we never leave our house?

The SERGEANT LEADER steps uncomfortably close to SANDRA.

LEADER
(in Spanish)
You know better - You've been
warned. The General’s daughter can
be shot.

BARNEY reacts to this.
SANDRA
(in Spanish to the
soldier)
Then do what you want - We are
leaving - We did nothing wrong.

LEADER
And him - Who is he?

She violently shoves a SOLDIER.

Suddenly the LEADER grabs SANDRA by the throat!

Puta! Traitor!

A RIFLE BUTT is buried into BARNEY’S KIDNEY. The LEADER jams
a PISTOL against BARNEY'S TEMPLE.

LEADER
(in Spanish)
Take her to her father!
The LEADER goes to strike SANDRA with his PISTOL, but a KNIFE
suddenly buries itself into his CHEST. CHRISTMAS steps from
his concealment.

BARNEY
Run!

BARNEY snatches the REVOLVER from the DEAD LEADER.

SANDRA takes off as CHRISTMAS throws another KNIFE through
the NECK of SOLDIER #2.

Dropping low, BARNEY blows a hole through SOLDIER #3 and #4.

BARNEY then wheels around hitting SOLDIER #5 directly under
the chin then SOLDIER #6 under his chin.

Christmas nails soldier #7.
SANDRA is running for her life as SOLDIER #8 races after her.

Rushing forward, CHRISTMAS whips another KNIFE that buries
itself into SOLDIER #9’s chest.

The throaty engine of the TRANSPORT TRUCK roars to life as
CHRISTMAS races into view.

Without breaking stride CHRISTMAS tears into view and yanks
the THROWING KNIFE out of DEAD SOLDIER #9’s body, then races
through the foliage attempting to intercept the truck.

MILITARY TRUCK

The truck’s frantic DRIVER yells into a WALKIE TALKIE as
SOLDIER #8 attempts to shove Sandra onto the TRUCK, when a
KNIFE buries itself into his back.

The DRIVER is still yelling into his WALKIE TALKIE when THREE

As the SOLDIERS pour out of the dwelling, we see that
SANDRA’S NEIGHBORS have been pulled from their homes and are
being brutally interrogated by Paine and his men. MONROE and
GARZA look on.
GARZA

Where is she? Where is the girl?

GARZA steps forward and stands in front of PAINE and slaps
the PEASANT hard. It is more of a show for MONROE’S benefit.

His expression darkens when he sees her teary eyes and
bruised face.

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

The well-lit court is presently occupied by ‘Lacy’s

strong men.

Christmas roars up on his motorcycle and LACY gets off the

LACY
Please, Lee, it’s over - It’s not

CHRISTMAS drives the BIKE onto the COURT and very slowly
drives in a wide circle around the whole dumbfounded team.

PAUL

He’s just runnin’ his mouth.

About thirty feet away, CHRISTMAS parks the BIKE and
dismounts.

You shouldn’t have bruised her
face.

PAUL
That’s not your business.

CHRISTMAS

way it was.

PAUL
Then keep the bitch. I’m done with
her.

Without a nanosecond of hesitation, CHRISTMAS charges up to
PAUL and starts pounding on him. Instantly he is jumped by

full destruct mode and in the matter of a few heartbeats, SIX
MEN lay agonizing on the court.

executes a perfect reverse spinning wheel kick, which
connects with Paul’s jaw.

He comes down, places the ball on the prostrated Paul’s
chest.

And with that he whips out one of his BLADES, buries it in
the ball. The ball flattens.

CHRISTMAS
Next time I deflate all of ‘em.

LACY

Passes nervously along the fence as CHRISTMAS pulls up on his
MOTORCYCLE.

EXT. GARZA’S PALACE - DUSK

An ARMY TRUCK occupied with EIGHT SOLDIERS rumbles through

the gates. Monroe, Paine and his men wait. The truck grinds
to halt. The rear of the truck opens and a terrified Sandra
is tossed out. Paine grabs her by the hair.

MONROE comes forward...GARZA watches from his BALCONY. His
hatred for MONROE is mounting.

MONROE

(calmly)
‘Sandra’, short for Alexandra,
which is Greek for ‘defender of
mankind.’ Bingo, here you are.
Synergy. If you’re not following
that, and you’re probably not,

Just then a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY smashes to the ground near
PAINE. Stunned, they glance up at GARZA, who glares at them
and his daughter.

GARZA

SANDRA
(to Garza in Spanish)
Have my father kill me!!
(she angrily pulls free)
If you want me gone, you do it! You
kill me! You kill who they want you

to! Why not me?!!

 

 

GARZA looks at her with dead eyes and backs from view.

Without warning PAINE hauls off and back slaps SANDRA so hard
across the face, her knees buckle. She then springs off the
ground and attacks PAINE, digging her nails into his
unprotected face. PAINE heaves her to the ground.

He drags her off by the hair, into Garza’s Palace. As the
doors slam shut...

INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT

BARNEY cannot concentrate any longer, setting down a WRENCH,
he starts to travel through the machinery until he reaches a
SLIDING DOOR, and entering continues towards a FAINT LIGHT.
He hears the faint sounds of music. Stepping forward, he
comes upon TOOL, who is painting on the front of a GUITAR.
TOOL sees him in the reflection of a MIRROR.

TOOL
Don’t you ever sleep?

BARNEY
Where’s your friend?

TOOL

Another one bites the dust - I was
paintin’ this for her, which I’m
gonna finish, let dry, then smash.

BARNEY
Wanna be alone?

Not really, no. So what’s up?

BARNEY steps forward into the faint light.

BARNEY
What dried up?

TOOL
The human parts, Bro. Remember that
op in Bosnia when we took down them
Serb bad boys. After that day of
bloodlettin’, I’m feeling kinda
dead too - my head’s in a very
black place, Dracula black, so I
get this bottle of local fire
water, ‘Slivowitz’ I think it was
called an’ I’m feelin’ no pain when
I come to this old wood bridge an’
see this woman standing on the
rail. I look at her, she looks at
me, an’ I know she’s gonna jump,

BARNEY cranks the wheel of his TRUCK and slams BROADSIDE into
SUV #1. The KILLER’S BULLETS are impaled in the passenger
side and driver’s side BULLET PROOF WINDOWS.

BARNEY

jams his truck into reverse and wheels around into a 180
degree turn. With tires SMOKING like a bat out of hell,
BARNEY floors the machine and the chase is on.

The SIDE WINDOW of SUV #2 rolls down and an AUTOMATIC RIFLE
is fired, splintering the passenger’s side window even more.

BARNEY and YANG whip around and see SUV #2 and GUNNAR’S
BRONCO charging after them.

Gunnar whips his BRONCO around traffic, closing in on BARNEY.

BARNEY swings his truck beneath an UNDERPASS - They crash
through barriers, as BULLETS bounce off of CEMENT PILLARS.

After a half dozen near misses, BARNEY and GUNNAR and the
other KILLERS then exit the UNDERPASS.

BARNEY tears into oncoming traffic. They all weave through a
DOZEN oncoming cars.

The trailing NONDESCRIPT SEDAN is set up and t-boned into a
LARGE DUMP TRUCK. Then YANG removes a MACHINE PISTOL from
behind the seat and kicks out the near shredded passenger
side window and fires at GUNNAR as BARNEY whips the TRUCK
into 180 degree turn. BARNEY straightens out the TRUCK and
the chase continues.

In the near distance he spots an industrial area. Smoke rises
from TONS of smoldering refuse being burned. BARNEY races
towards a massive dilapidated FACTORY.

BARNEY plows the TRUCK through one of the factory’s old large
WINDOWS. GUNNAR follows. GLASS SPLINTERS everywhere. BARNEY
speeds ahead and whips into 180 degree turn and races toward
GUNNAR.

GUNNAR’S eyes widen in horror as his BRONCO catapults several
feet into the air and lands upside down.

The badly damaged vehicle lays on it’s side, STEAM pouring
from under the hood.

BARNEY’S TRUCK

As YANG leans over to BARNEY to pull him upright, GUNSHOTS
rip through the silence and BULLETS tear into the TRUCK’S
SIDE.

GUNNAR

YANG leaves BARNEY and rolls from the TRUCK. BLOODY and badly
shaken up, he puts his pain aside and moves forward.

Suddenly the high caliber PISTOL is KICKED from GUNNAR’S hand
by YANG.

YANG commences to ferociously attack GUNNAR. GUNNAR is dazed
and staggers against a clump of TREES. YANG goes in for the
kill, but GUNNAR rises and strikes YANG with an arching back
fist delivered by his MASSIVE ARM. Now it’s GUNNAR’S turn to
attack.

GUNNAR

kicks YANG with such brute force, YANG is sent flying, and
collides in a semi-conscious state. GUNNAR charges after him.

YANG attacks GUNNAR who again dominates with his incredible
strength and grabs YANG by the throat in a similar fashion as
the first scene.

BARNEY is coming to and reaches under the dash and touches a
LATCH and a .45 CALIBER PISTOL drops into view.

YANG cracks GUNNAR across his EYES which frees him up. YANG
then zeroes in on his stunned opponent and proceeds to rally
back.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 83

Badly weakened by the barrage, GUNNAR’S knees are repeatedly
assaulted, but though he tries to ignore the pain, his legs
are finally weakened by a ferocious kick that shatters his
right knee. YANG, exhausted and bloody studies the man for a
moment then moves off. GUNNAR’S hand finds his PISTOL close
by and raises the PISTOL.

BARNEY fires and GUNNAR collapses to the ground. YANG stares
at his foe.

YANG moves off and passes BARNEY in silence. BARNEY goes to
GUNNAR and kneels beside the mortally wounded man.

GUNNAR
Why’d you shoot me? *
BARNEY
You were gonna kill ‘im.

SANDRA’S throat. She gags and struggles like she’s being
drowned, which she is. Suddenly, GARZA’S THREE SPECIAL RED

aside while the OTHER smashes the WATER PITCHER to the floor.
PAINE attempts to draw his PISTOL, but is facing down one of

MONROE eyes the PHOTOS of SANDRA, his mind races.

CHRISTMAS

On the second floor, he places an EXPLOSIVE in another
strategic locale.

A FOOT flies out of the doorway knocking one guard cold. HALE
CAESAR sweeps the second GUARD off his feet and puts him to
sleep with an elbow to the forehead. He places an EXPLOSIVE
and splits.

EXT. - SECURITY FENCE

With the GUARDS idly pacing overhead, YANG plants a rigged
charge against a POST, then moves on to the next post.

BARNEY

Moving along the basement tunnels, BARNEY moves further down
the corridor. By the glow of his MINI-FLASHLIGHT, he finds
another SUPPORT BEAM overhead. His attention is drawn to
tightly wrapped WHITE BRICKS. Drawing a knife, he cuts one
open and PURE COCAINE pours out.

HALL GUARD (HALE CAESAR)

A SOLDIER minds his post. His eyes become alert when he hears
movement off to his side. Turning his head in that direction,
he peers into the dimly lit distance. Nothing there. Slowly
turning his head back, we see HALE CAESAR’S bone chilling
presence behind the GUARD. In a flash a python-like FOREARM
whips around his throat and they wipe from frame.

YANG

plants another charge against the SECURITY FENCE. He reaches
in and opens the release TAPS to large GASOLINE STORAGE
CONTAINERS. The FLUID begins to flow along the fence.

TOLL ROAD

A SOLDIER passes an alcove. TOLL ROAD leaps from view and in
a highly original maneuver, breaks him in half.

CHRISTMAS

slips down the hallway, approaching GENERAL GARZA’S Chambers
as he takes out a SENTRY.

CHRISTMAS drags the body into an ADJOINING ROOM as the LARGE
MAN passes. Without hesitation, he places a CHARGE at the
base of the wall.

plants a charge against another portion of the palace’s
FOUNDATION. Again he sees more massive packaged STACKS of
COCAINE. Checking his WATCH, he bolts off with a heightened
sense of purpose.

HALE CAESAR

is placing a CHARGE just as a GUARD holding a FLASHLIGHT
opens the door.

Without so much as a second of hesitation, HALE CAESAR steps
out of the darkness and skull butts the GUARD. He crumbles.

TOLL ROAD

Climbs onto the PALACE ROOF. It is an eerie sight. Up ahead
are TWO SOLDIERS.

CHRISTMAS

Climbs onto the PALACE ROOF. From his vantage point he can
see TOLL ROAD. He gestures to move ahead.

ROOF GUARDS

Are at opposite ends of the wide roof. One turns and is
slammed squarely in the center of his face with a STUDDED
MUAY THAI knee kick. CHRISTMAS at nearly the same instant
renders his man unconscious. He stares over the edge at the
SOLDIERS mulling around in the COURTYARD, then places his
CHARGE. Likewise TOLL ROAD.

BARNEY

glides down the dark stone corridor. He pauses. In the
distance, he sees the glow of a CIGARETTE belonging to one of
the TWO GUARDS standing in front of SANDRA’S dank cell. They
passe from view mumbling in Spanish.

SANDRA’S CELL

The GUARDS enter. The LARGER GUARD’S CIGARETTE is glowing in

CHAIR and BLINDFOLDED.

GENERAL GARZA'S CHAMBERS - BALCONY

The GENERAL'S eyes are clouded over. PAINE and the TWO
OPERATIVES just stare at the unpredictable dictator. He makes
the final stroke.

GARZA
..-This clears the mind.

GARZA stares at MONROE with a long unnerving pause.

MONROE
...What?

We see the PAINTING as GARZA’S eyes bore into the CANVAS. It
is a painting of his daughter rushing past a burning
landscape.

GARZA

Do you have puppets at home?
MONROE

What?
GARZA

No - But you think you have one
here in front of you - Do you think
I’m your puppet?

MONROE
No, that’s just in your mind.

MONROE
I’m trying real hard to figure out
what’s going on in your head.

GARZA
You! - You’re in there! I thought
maybe the people of Vilena paid
these mercenaries to kill me - I
thought that! But then I think
maybe this is your plan because you
can’t control me. Then I think that
torturing my daughter works for
you. I feel it. But she is now
loyal to me and you want to kill
her to make me suffer. A man can
never kill a child, but you can.

MONROE
You’re losing your mind!

GARZA
You do not control me anymore!

MONROE
(losing it)
Control you? I own you!

The RED BERETS step forward, holding their WEAPONS at the
‘ready.’ In the DIM CANDLELIGHT, they present a terrifying
vision.

GARZA

(forcefully)
Nobody owns me! No more!! Bring my
daughter here! Bring her! She knows
who is doing this! Bring her now!
Bring her in front of me and I will
ask her if she is loyal to you or
me! Bring her or I'll kill all of
you!!

PAINE looks to MONROE, who’s thoroughly exasperated.

MONROE
Get her!!

232 CELL GUARDS

One of the sleazy CELL GUARDS touches SANDRA’S hair, sampling
the texture. Blindfolded, she recoils and curses.
SECOND PINK REVISIONS 5/11/09 95

The OTHER ONE touches her neck then her breasts. She curses
and spits in rage. The GUARD enjoys this and kicks her CHAIR
over.

GUARD
Too good for us.

The SECOND GUARD draws hard on a CIGARETTE until the ember
glows firey RED.

As the GUARD goes to burn SANDRA, we see a bright STEEL BLADE
slash through the darkness and the hand holding the red hot
CIGARETTE is severed. Still blindfolded, SANDRA’S body
convulses when she hears the man’s anguished scream. BARNEY
then plunges the huge dagger’s blade into the other SOLDIER’S
chest, then silences the first SOLDIER’S SCREAMS with a neck
thrust. Their heavy bodies collapse beside SANDRA, who’s
screaming hysterically. BARNEY covers her mouth as he whips
off her BLINDFOLD.

SANDRA
(hysterical in Spanish)
No! No! Don’t hurt me! No more!
Please! No more!

BARNEY
Sandra, it’s me! It’s me! Nobody
will hurt you.

SANDRA

PAINE suddenly explodes from his concealment and slams BARNEY
with a forearm across the face. SANDRA screams, BARNEY
crumbles. PAINE drops a knee to BARNEY’S midsection. The
other TWO OPERATIVES and a huge RED BERET SOLDIER step into
view.

OPERATIVE #2 grabs BARNEY in a lethal choke hold, yanking him
upright. OPERATIVE #1 strips BARNEY of his WEAPONS including

PAINE throws an elbow shot that lands with colossal force on
BARNEY’S chest. BARNEY sags.

PAINE slams him again. As BARNEY buckles, PAINE motions to

have BARNEY barely grasping onto consciousness.

Enraged, PAINE draws back for the killshot, just as YANG
drops through the overhead GRATE and brutally sidekicks PAINE
to the mid-section. He then kicks the American Operative
releasing BARNEY as YANG attacks Operative #1.

CHRISTMAS drops down next, slamming a potent ELBOW into
OPERATIVE #3’s JAW. TOLL ROAD comes charging out of the
darkness and tears into the RED BERET SOLDIERS, who
themselves are great fighters. PAINE moves out of the fray.

PAINE turns and is hit by BARNEY, which drives him back
slightly and they end up in a dismal, barely lit room. PAINE
uses his superior strength to dominate. BARNEY is slammed
hard to the brick floor. He goes to pull his short barrelled
PISTOL from behind his back. PAINE goes to stomp BARNEY, he
rolls and hooks PAINE’S leg. They roll around punches at
close quarters. BARNEY is on his feet and rains down a
torrent of punches that has PAINE on his heels.

TUNNELS

Just as YANG, CHRISTMAS, and TOLL ROAD have subdued their
opponents, a SQUAD of TEN BERETS come pouring into the
tunnels and open fire, pinning our guys against the wall.
Lethal CHUNKS of MORTAR and STONE are ripped from the damp
walls.

PAINE

In a brutal choke hold, the escalated gunfire draws his
attention. Sensing that the battle is getting out of hand, he
moves off into the darkness. BARNEY gasps for air, then rises
to one knee.

You’re windin’ up his complex.

CHRISTMAS
(to Yang)
Want me to get you a parachute?

LACY
Please, just ignore him.

YANG
(to Lacy)
Maybe he’s mad ‘cause you’re having
my child.

CHRISTMAS
That hurts.

YANG sinks the ball.

The FRONT DOOR opens and GUNNAR enters. HALE CAESAR sees him
first.

CAESAR
(rising)
There’s a damn zombie in the house!
Welcome, Brother.

He goes towards him. CHRISTMAS, LACY, YANG and TOLL ROAD
cease playing. GUNNAR almost appears shy as he stands near
BARNEY and TOOL, who’s completed tattooing.

TOOL
Welcome back from the dead, Big
man.

GUNNAR

Yeah, feels good.

CHRISTMAS removes GUNNAR’S LARGE KNIFE from resting on a
STOOL near the POOL TABLE and heads towards BARNEY and
GUNNAR. TOLL ROAD, que still in hand, steps up. Only YANG
hangs back and continues to shoot pool alone.

LACY
Who's that?

CHRISTMAS
Long story.

TOLL ROAD

(to Gunnar)
How ya feelin’?

GUNNAR
Considerin’ he coulda killed me,
lucky.

HALE CAESAR
Luck, hell, his ego’s bigger then a
gumbo chef’s ass, but he hits what
he wants to hit.

GUNNAR
(to Barney)
Thanks for bringing me back.

BARNEY
Promise is a promise.

TOOL’S GIRLFRIEND drifts next to him.

TOOL
Hey, Darlin,’ what’s new?

CHRISTMAS steps over to GUNNAR. LACY’S at his side.

CHRISTMAS
(handing over Gunnar’s
knife)
You might want it back -

GUNNAR
Thanks. Get a chance to use it?

CHRISTMAS
Yeah, came in handy, but the
balance is a little off.
(gesturing)
Gunnar, this is my very nice but
very homely girlfriend.

LACY
That’s sweet.
(to Gunnar)

Nice to meet you.

GUNNAR notices YANG at the POOL TABLE. GUNNAR heads towards
him. TOOL gestures to CHRISTMAS then pulls out his knife.

TOOL
(to Cheyenne)
Y’know Darlin’ I’m feelin’ terribly
accurate at this moment. Hundred
bucks.

CHRISTMAS
(to Cheyenne)
If you want to impress her, buy her
some nice earrings instead.

TOOL
(opens his knife)
Fear’s a terrible thing.

GUNNAR goes to YANG.

GUNNAR
...-Hey, what can I say?

YANG
You weren't yourself.

GUNNAR
Yeah, that wasn’t me - Sorry.

GUNNAR extends his HAND. YANG takes it.

YANG
But I would’ve won.

GUNNAR
(smiles)
...Never.

TOOL and CHRISTMAS square off.
TOOL is still baiting CHRISTMAS.

TOOL
(to the group)
Yo, Outcasts, gather ‘round ‘cause
ya gonna see a grown man cry.
(to Christmas)
A hundred bucks and Kleenex to weep
into.

CHRISTMAS
Talk’s cheap.

TOOL
(taking aim)
Like my cologne - Darlin’, you
never give up, never give in, a boy
versin’ a man can never win.

TOOL snaps forward and whips his knife with startling speed
and it buries itself near HITLER’S CHEEK.

CHRISTMAS shrugs as the onlookers emit a variety of ‘oohs’
and ‘ahs.’

CHRISTMAS
(to Barney)
That’s inspiring.
(to Lacy)
Inspirational.
(to the boys)
Even intimidatin...’

CHRISTMAS turns his back away from the target and starts to
pace away ever so slowly.

CHRISTMAS
(recites)
“There’s a dude known only as TOOL,
Crazy, but the epitome of COOL.”

EXT. STREET

CHRISTMAS opens the parlor’s door and steps onto the
sidewalk.

CHRISTMAS
(still walking)
“Good with a KNIFE, very bad with a
WIFE,
But braggin’ he'll beat me, wow,
Cool Tool has to be a world class
FOOL.”

Now standing in the middle of the street, CHRISTMAS rapidly
whips around, and with incredible accuracy, whips his KNIFE
directly into the center of HITLER’S face.

TOOL
(laughs )
Man, losing to a bad poet, that
does hurt.

TOOL gives him a hug.

The room explodes with a cheer. CHRISTMAS and BARNEY exchange
smiles of mutual admiration.

Suddenly a very loud hissing sound is heard and a massive
BOWIE KNIFE soars across the room, hitting HITLER in the

chest with such force, it splits the target completely in
half. Stunned, everyone turns and faces GUNNAR, who looks
terribly embarrassed.

GUNNAR
Checkin’ the balance.

BARNEY
Don’t worry about it. We’1ll take it
out of your pay.

At that moment, HALE CAESAR turns up the music and the
festive mood kicks in as we dissolve out of TOOL’S and into
the street where the camera soars high above TOOL’S building
and beyond.

THE END.

OMITTED

ALTERNATE ENDING may be:

The EXPENDABLES leaving TOOL’S SOCIAL CLUB astride the

incredible looking CHOPPERS and fading into the hot night
air.
