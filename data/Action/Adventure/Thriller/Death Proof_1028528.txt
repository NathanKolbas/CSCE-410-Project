POV OF A CAR WINDSHIELD ~ DAY

 

The car is driving fast down the road. A pair of female Des
bare feet with a gold ankle bracelet lie propped upon the _ -
dashboard emanating from the passenger seat.

A Good God Almighty rockabilly tune beats out of the car
stereo, the feet tap to the beat. :

The opening credits play out over this image.
As the music continues
WE. CUT TO:

- INT JUNGLE. JULIA’S APARTMENT .— DAY

A tall (maybe 6ft). Amazonian: Mulatto: goddess’ walks down her
hallway, dressed in a baby tee, and panties that her big:
ass (a good thing) spill out of, and her long legs grow out

of. Her big bare feet slap on the hard wood floor. She

moves to the cool rockabilly beat’ as she paces like a tiger
putting on her clothes.

Outside her apartment she hears a “Honk Honk”.

 

She sticks her long mane of silky black curly hair, her
giraffish neck and her broad shoulders, out of the window
and yells down to a car below.

This sexy chick is Austin, Texas, local celebrity, JUNGLE
JULIA LUCAI, the most popular discjockey of the coolest
rock radio station in a music town.
JUNGLE JULIA
I'm comin’ down!
EXT — STREET OUTSIDE JULIA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Two girls are’ getting out of a white Honda civic, that's
parked across the street from Jungle Julia’s ‘apartment.

One girl. is SHANNA...

The other (the one with the sexy opening credit feet) is
ARLENE. .

All three girls are in their seven years after college
phase (about twenty-eight).

The dynamic of the trio is as such, Julia, Shanna, and
Arlene all went to the University of Texas together.

 
 

Shanna being a Texas ‘native.
Julia being from Los Angeles.
Arlene being from Brooklyn. ‘ 8 meee

After school was over, Arlene went back to New: York, Julia
got into’ the “l6eal Austin music scene, -becoming: a. fixture **:
onthe scene, “and ultimately becoming a drive time D.J.. for
the local oldies radio station Austin Hot Wax 505, and in

wh

Arlene‘s in town visiting for a week, ahd it's. sorta...
fallin” on Shanna to take care of her. :

But since Julia’s become a celebrity. in the meantime,. every

plan: arrangement, ‘arid girls night ‘out is vaguely catered
around Julia.

As Julia screams down to them, Arlene hurries across the ©
street and screams up to her in her thick Brooklyn accent.

ARLENE
(yelling up)
Hold on, I gotta come up! I gotta
take the world’s biggest fuckin’
piss! .

JUNGLE JULIA
. (yelling down)
We can't be late!

SHANNA
(yelling ‘up)
We: won't!

As Arlene and Shanna hurry up the stairs to Julia‘s
apartment, the rockabilly on the soundtrack is cut off. (by.

a needle being lifted) and a different song is put on the
soundtrack. :

- INT -~ JUNGLE JULIA’S APARTMENT — Day

Julia has just put on a new record and is. dancing to the
music. :

Arlene enters the front door with ‘an I. gotta pee body
language. : :

Julia points in the direction of the bathroom.

Arlene disappears behind the bathroom door.

Shanna and Julia dance to the record while Arlene pees.

INT -. BATHROOM - DAY

Arlene is sittifig-on the toilet, a horse race, ‘stream-of
piss can be heard’ emanating from undér her. We slowly. zoom.
into the pretty” face ‘of relief. : wi . :

 

EXT = JUNGLE JULIA'S APARTMENT — DAY

In slow motion, the three girls walk out of the ‘apartment, -
and head for their car.

They climb into Shanna’s car, and head off to their next
exciting 3 girls’3 adventure. cae

As the Honda drives away, A SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

words of Julia, “a fucking cool dive”.. Maybe the audience
notices the girls white Honda and the Driver’s muscle car
in the parking lot, maybe they don’t.” .

INT HUCK'S — NIGHT

.The song from before continues on Huck's extremely cool

vintage jukebox.

Jungle Julia, pint of beer in one hand and’ lit cigarette in
the other, does a very sexy dance to the bluesey rock
classic. . For the audience in Huck's as well as the movie
theatre she’s putting on ‘a one-ho-show.

Our: three fox ‘posse, ‘has collectéd “some ‘stray sniffing
dogs. The aforementioned NATE and OMAR and PETE.

Omar's talking up Shanna at their beer spilled, peanut
shelled strewn table. Pete's drinking Shiner Bock beer
from a pitcher, admiring Julia's dance. Arlene and Nate
are dancing together (he’s holding her. from behind and
their pelvises are moving together). Which shows Arlene's
not a goody two shoes, she's out-to party, she’s just not
clear about the new dynamic with her old college pals.

Needless to say, everybody's drunk.

The song ends, and Warren, the owner operator of Huck's,
yells to Julia; me .

Her girls, and the bar; with the possible exception of
Nate, cheer her on.

Pam and Warren can’t wipe the’ smiles offof their faces.

By the end, Jungle. Julia is taking photos with her
instamatic, as Arlene and Mike do funny sexy poses.

Before the song ends, Arlene finishes up, she doesn’t give
Mike a kiss, but very lovingly hdlds his face in her two
hands, like the sweet Italian Mama ‘that she is.

And as the song concludes , without another word, the girls,
dance out the door of the bar ard ‘leave.

- In the b.g., the girls are arguing who’s sober enough to

drive, leaving their male admirers whining to.go with them.

JUNGLE JULIA
_ Yeah, keep it up, nothing makes me
wanna ‘fuck more then men whining.

Lanna-Frank wins thé I'm the less drunk argument, .the: most’
stoned, but less drunk. So she gets behind. the wheel, and
the other girls, Julia, Arlene and Shanna, pile in.

But that’s in the b.g.. We stay with Stuntman Mike and Pam.

Pam is taken by the sight of the badass black muscle car.

STUNTMAN MIKE ‘
Well this is'a’mévie car. And

Pam climbs. | : :
Stuntman Mike shuts. the -door.
As he walks around to thé. passenger side:

He watches the other girls peel out, showering gravel. —
They make a left onto the highway, and disappear.

He smiles after.them as. he climbs behind the. wheel of his
death proof vehicle. . ‘ .

INT - DEATH PROOF -— NIGHT
Stuntman Mike is in the drivers seat.
Pam is in the plexiglass box.

A plexiglass wall with some holes. to talk through, separate
them. ans ee

Mike has a few different seat belts to ‘snap in place for
himself.

Pam doesn’t even have a car seat. She has a post that

sticks out of the floor, that you would attach a camera to,
that she has to balance herself on. .- .

PAM
You know, when you.asked to drive
me home,. you didn’t mention your
car didn’t have a Passenger seat.

That is a bright side:

Stuntman Mike ‘smiles back through thé plexiglass.

  

"STUNTMAN MIKE

He yanks a homemade “im tal “lever, ‘that slides a metal bar:
into place, locking both doors. . : :

Then starts up his powerful machine.
Pam -smiles at ‘the ‘excitement ‘of, this trembling machine.,.
He slides the car into First, and, pulls up to the highway.

Which way you goin’,. left or right?
a ‘PAM
Right.

__,, STUNTMAN, MIKE
‘Oh, that’s too bad.

Thriller music sting happens on soundtrack.
Still smiling.

: "PAM :
Why is that ‘too bad?.
STUNTMAN MIKE

Because it was a fifty fifty shot.
on whether, you'd be goin‘ left .or
right. You see we're both goin’
left, and you could of just as
easily been goin’ left too, and if
that was the case, then it would of
been awhile before you would. of
started gétting scared. . But since

. afraid you're gonna hafta get
scared immediately.

Pam's smile fades away, as a look of Oh Shit terror
replaces it.

 
 

 

71.

As the look of panic appears...
Stuntman Mike jerks a hard left on to the road...

She’s maybe scared shitless, yet Pam is one tough chick,
and she lets loose with a violent stream of curses aimed at
the Driver. ~

He shuts her up, by turning up the radio real.loud, and.
driving -réal. crazy, tossing ‘her helplessly around .the.,

plexiglass box, crashing like a rag doll from wall to
wall.

He does things like drive straight towards telephone poles:
at full speed :then narrowly miss them.

STUNTMAN MIKE -
‘member when I said, this car was
death proof? Well, that wasn’t.a
lie. “This. car is 100 percent death
proof. Only, to get the benefit of
it, you really hafta be sitting in
my seat. :

He slams on the brakes and Pam goes flying face first into
the unpaved dashboard. Her face might as well have
exploded.

‘Stuntman Mike busts a gut laughing.

STUNTMAN MIKE
Boy, ya gotta love them unpaved
dashboards. Ya get into a wreck,
ya just hose it off, and sell it to
somebody else.

Pam's nose is smashed across hér face, her front teeth are
knocked out, and her jaw is busted. . . : .

But she’s still conscious. :

face, ripping her face off.

Just enjoys the ride:

 

Stuntman Mike crashed into the girls.on the -highway that
was part of an: overpass, so the two twisted. :wrecks tumble
over the side crashing‘ onto the highway below.

Shanna looks up and sees Stuntman Mike’s car falling on.
her,. she’s pulverized. .

Another car, also driven by a woman, sees the twisted cars fall
into ‘the road in front of her, it’s too late to do anything.

She crashes into both of them at seventy miles an hour.
Destroying her car and herself. :

The highway is deserted except for the busted broken cars,
and the blood and glass, and flesh and body parts that
litter the highway. : :

We see a tape put ina tape player.

His eyes then go to the two bare feet of the sleeping girl
Propped up on the car door window, and her friend in’ the
drivers seat zoning out on her iPod.

He steps. out of his car, and approaches the two bare feet...
Peering inside; he sees. Abernathy. dead tothe world.

  

’* He glances back at the store, Kim's not looking “in this

direction, too involved in creating the xight mixture for
her big ass cup of coffee. Lee, back to him, ear phones in

He looks back to sleeping beauty, and the. pretty bare feet
he’s close enough to touch.

Stuntman Mike removes’ the black leather glove from his
burnt right hand. Taking his index finger, he runs it down
the bare sole of Abernathy’s foot. . ~
‘He watches her.

Stuntman Mike has blasted pass and walks around ‘the hood of
his car to his. driver side door... He doesn't hurry like
he's guilty and fleeing, but like he’s absentmindedly
xushing to his car, and“maybe he accidently, brushed pass
her feet on his Way, ‘as’ well as Lee's « elbows that was
sticking out the drivers side cdr door window. :

With ear phones still in her ears +. She yells after him;

REVS IT UP, vibrating next to the two girls.

Lee smiles and holds up her two fingers making a small
pinch gesture to Abernathy in the back seat.

LEE

Upon’ seeing his face, her smile fades and she says to

field of tall grass. .

clips them on the girls left side. mo

dreidel, whipping around a full three revolutions.

‘B06 is sent flying from the hood:

TALL GRASS

Zoé as if shot from a gun that uses New Zealand women as

- ammo, sails over the grass, finally crashing deep in the

brush. Her fall is obstructed from view.

“The Charger skids to a stop. For a moment the girls sit

shell shocked.

Stuntman Mike has stopped, too. He looks at the girls.
He's thinking maybe he should let these girls be.

When Kim turns and sees him and his car stopped. She yanks

‘the pistol out of her ankle holster, brings it up and FIRES

at him.

The Bullet hits him right in the shoulder. He streamis at’
