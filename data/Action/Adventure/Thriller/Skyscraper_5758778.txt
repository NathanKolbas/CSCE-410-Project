FADE IN:

EXT. SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT

From high above, we look straight down a FOREST OF TOWERING
PINES standing in a field of moonlit snow.

We glide over the treetops, floating just above their peaks
as a light snow falls, the flakes corkscrewing lazily away.

All seems peaceful, silent.

Then we notice a strange light playing against the fresh
powder. Red, then blue. Then red again.

We crest a final stand of trees to reveal: AN ENTIRE
ENCAMPMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, some three hundred or so
police, fire and ambulance, situated in what appears to be
the middle of nowhere.

From this angle, directly overhead, the SQUAD CARS and SWAT
VANS almost look like toys. Nothing moves. The POLICE
OFFICERS and SWAT Team members, hunkered down in firing
positions, point their weapons at something unseen.

We tilt from our isolating top-down view to reveal that this
paramilitary phalanx is surrounding: a MODEST FARMHOUSE.

It's a standoff of some kind, clearly.

Then we see an ANT-SIZED FIGURE moving urgently across this
frozen tableau. We slowly zoom in on the ant, revealing him
to be a MAN IN A WINDBREAKER.

We move with him now, tracking a FOLDED NOTE that he carries
in his hand, as he brings us to a TACTICAL TRAILER with a
seal emblazoned on the door:

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM

The Windbreaker Man enters and we go with him...

and a NEGOTIATOR on the phone, flanked by the HOSTAGE RESCUE
COMMANDER ("HR1i") and the ON SCENE COMMANDER, the man

The Windbreaker Man hands the On Scene the folded note. He
reads it and nods. Meanwhile, the Negotiator works the
phone in a last ditch attempt to talk this through...

WIFE, his DAUGHTER and his six year-
them hunkered down below the kitchen
against the cabinet doors.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

RAY (cont'd)
It's alright. Everything's gonna be
alright now. I promise.

Ray moves to a HEAVY CHEST and throws it open, staring at
what's inside. A grim look washes over his face.

INT. TAC OPS COMMAND TRAILER / COMMS ROOM - NIGHT

The Negotiator looks up gravely from dial tone in his hand.
The On Scene looks to HR1.

HR1
Gold Unit is in position. They have
compromise authority and are at ready
green. We're set, sir.

ON SCENE
(re: the note)
7th floor approves escalation.
(to the Negotiator)
Can you get him back on the phone?

NEGOTIATOR
He's done talking.

ON SCENE
(beat)
Very well.

The On Scene exits the COMMS ROOM and moves into the main
trailer where he picks up a headset.

ON SCENE (cont'd)
Gold Unit, this is "Tock", be advised
you have control. Repeat, you have
control.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The REFLECTION in the farmhouse window shows SWAT UNITS
backing off. Ray's request, it seems, has been met.

The window curtains crack to reveal Ray watching the action.
We drop down from the window and pivot off of Ray to reveal:

THE FARMHOUSE YARD.

A blanket of snow, some bushes, a woodpile.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

We hold on this frame -- but nothing happens. A moment
more. Still nothing.

Then...

One of the BUSHES moves. Then part of a WOODPILE seems to
detach. And a section of snow right in front of us this
whole time, rises revealing itself to have GREEN EYES.

And now we see it: a SIX-MAN FBI HRT ASSAULT TEAM moves from
their camouflaged hides and stacks up tight against the wall
just below the farmhouse window.

They slough off their elaborate camouflage, revealing each
man to be kitted out in body armor and loaded for bear.

We land on the team leader, WILL FORD, a seasoned operator.
Will speaks softly into his comm...

WILL
Gold Unit in position.

Will looks at his second in command, his best friend and a
man we'll know later as HORACE. Will nods. Horace moves,
setting a heavy-duty BREACHING CHARGE on the farmhouse wall.

Finished, Horace slides back into position giving Will the
thumbs up. Will nods and begins the countdown...

WILL (cont'd)
Five, four, three, two, one...
Execute. Execute. Execute.
Will depresses a THUMB PLUNGER, igniting the breaching
charge -- BANG! The sound is deafening as the wall explodes,
leaving a gaping hole of smoke and dust in its wake.

Will rushes in, primary through the door. We go with him,
pushing through the thick haze to find

RAY HUTCHINSON

standing there, his back to us. Will and Horace go to guns
on him, their sites leveled, fingers poised on triggers.

WILL (cont'd)
Turn around! Show us your hands!

HORACE
Do it! Now!

The rest of the HRT UNIT fans out near Will, securing the
mother and daughter who won't stop screaming.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

Slowly, Ray turns to face Will revealing that he's HOLDING
HIS SIX YEAR-OLD SON in his arms -- the boy's head wedged
into the crook of his father's neck.

HORACE (cont'd)

Boss...
WILL
Hold your fire.
(to Ray)

Put him down.
Ray hesitates. Horace grips his M-4, staring down it.

HORACE
+..-I've got him clean...

The boy's eyes lock with Will's.

WILL
No. Don't. I got this.

Will turns to Ray, speaking with authoritative calm...
WILL (cont'd)
Ray, look at me. Look at me. It's over
now. It's over. Put your son down, get
on your knees and interlace your
fingers behind your head. Do it now.
Ray takes it all in, the madness he's caused. The pain.

RAY
I'm sorry.

Ray lets his son slide off of him to the ground, revealing
something horrifying: RAY IS WEARING A SUICIDE VEST.

Will's eyes go wide -- he dives for Horace, tackling him
behind the KITCHEN COUNTER just as:

THE VEST DETONATES.

boom.

A ring of tinnitus in our ear. Screaming. Will,
disoriented, catches glimpses of his team shattered -- dead
or dying. A living nightmare.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

The horror of it washes over Will: his call to hold fire has
cost the lives of those he cares about most in this world:
his team, his men, his brothers.

Devastated, Will mumbles over and over...

WILL
No-no-no-no...

Sound falls away. Everything goes to white.

We're in a hallway now somehow. The strobe of overhead
florescent lights rushing past us.

Then a face looks down at us. A Naval surgeon we'll come to
know as SARAH. She smiles at us and says...

SARAH
You're gonna be okay.

HARD CUT TO:
TITLE CARD:

TEN YEARS LATER

EXT. PARK - DAY

A sun-dappled city park. Green grass. Trees. A little
creek babbles nearby. Two kids, seven year-old fraternal
twins, HENRY and GEORGIA argue about what to play: hide &
seek or tag. Georgia gets her way: they'll play tag.

We find Will, older now, a sadness behind his eyes. But
sitting on the grass watching the children play, he can't
help but smile.

SARAH (0.C.)
She takes after you, you know.

Will turns to see his beautiful wife, Sarah, the surgeon who
saved his life, enjoying the moment with him.

WILL
You think?

SARAH
Oh yeah. Stubborn. Too hard on
herself. Cries during sports movies.

WILL
I don't cry during sports movies.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Will laughs.

SARAH
Rudy.
WILL
Well, come on. It's Rudy.
SARAH
Field of Dreams.
WILL
Everyone cries at Field of Dreams--
SARAH
A League of Their Own.
WILL
That was one time. And I was on
medication.
SARAH
Benedryl.
WILL
Extra strength -- and fine, maybe

she's got my personality. I'm just
glad she got your looks.

SARAH
Me too because you'd make a really
ugly woman. Like if we put a dress
on you, the only thing missing would
be neck-bolts.

WILL
Hang on -- back up. Did you call me
stubborn?
SARAH
You are stubborn.
WILL
Since when?
SARAH

Since always. Now say it.

WILL
Come on. I got it.

SARAH
Then let me hear you say it.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

(2)

WILL
Who's being stubborn now?

SARAH
I'm being insistent. There's a
difference. Besides, don't you want
to make a good impression?

WILL
Not really.

SARAH
I'm serious, Will. It'll go a long
way with him -- it's a cultural

thing. Just say it.

WILL
Fine.
(beat)
Hen gaoxing de wen ni.

It's Cantonese. And it actually wasn't that bad...

SARAH
That's great.

WILL
Really?

SARAH

Perfect. Perfectly done. The
intonation, the enunciation. A+.

WILL
Thank you. See? I'm not stubborn.
I can be taught.

SARAH
One thing though.

WILL
What?

SARAH

I taught you how to say: Hou hoi sam
sik dou nei, "It's an honor to meet
you." But you said, "Hou hoi sam sek
dou nei."

WILL
And what does that mean?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

SARAH
It's an honor to kiss you.

WILL
Ah. And that's bad?

SARAH
Depends on what kind of meeting you
wanna have.

WILL
Alright -- I give up. No more
Chinese. I've gotta get ready.

Will stands up calling out to the kids...

WILL (cont'd)
Henry! Georgia! Time to go!

The kids look at their father. Georgia capitalizes on the
distraction, tagging her twin brother...

GEORGIA
Tag! You're it!

...then bolting. Henry cries foul and gives chase. The two
kids run toward their father with abandon. Will smiles.

Georgia reaches Will first, wrapping her arms around her
father's leg...

GEORGIA (cont'd)
Base! Dad's base! I'm safe!

...and that's when we see that Will's right leg isn't made
of flesh and bone but rather metal and plastic -- a
PROSTHESIS FROM THE KNEE DOWN. A scar he bears from that
fateful night ten years ago.

Henry arrives grabbing hold of Will's other leg.

HENRY
Safe!
GEORGIA
I'm already safe, you can't be safe
too.
HENRY
Yes I can.
GEORGIA

That's stupid.

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED: (4)

WILL
Hey -- not nice. And your brother's
right. You're both safe. Daddy is
safe for everyone because-- WHOA!

-- suddenly Will jumps a foot as Sarah dumps an entire
bottle of water down his back.

SARAH
Tag you're it!

Sarah takes off running, laughing. Will gives chase, his
kids squealing with delight at their parents playing.

Will catches Sarah, planting a big kiss on her before she
tickles him and trips him to the ground, falling on top of
him as both Henry and Georgia join in: a dog pile on daddy.

Will lets himself get pinned, laughing -- in heaven.

It's then that we PULL BACK from this idyllic familial
scene, past the grass and the trees and the babbling brook.
We continue pulling back, further and further still, until
we reveal something shocking.

This park isn't in a city. And it's not in a small town.
This entire THREE ACRE PARK exists on the 100TH FLOOR OF THE
TALLEST BUILDING IN THE WORLD.

A newly completed, three-thousand foot tall work of stunning
architecture called THE PEARL rises gracefully from
shoreline of VICTORIA HARBOR, dwarfing the surrounding
skyline. We're in...

Hong Kong
Then a SOOTHING VOICE...

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
Welcome to The Pearl...

Quickly, we find ourselves in a highly polished PROMOTIONAL
VIDEO...

SOOTHING VOICE
+..a marvel of modern engineering.
Standing at over three-thousand feet,
The Pearl's 225 stories make it the
world's tallest building...

(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED: (5)

We get our first good look at this work of art: a TOWERING,
TWISTING, SKYSCRAPER with an OPEN-AIR CENTER CORE running
its entire length, from top to bottom, giving the structure
an airy, sunlit translucent grandeur.

SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
...it's so tall, you could fit the
Empire State building inside of it
twice! And you'd still have room for
a 50 story building on top!

-- B-roll of construction and slick computer generated fly-
through designs fill the frame.

SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
Completed just last year, China's
newest beacon of progress boasts a
five-star hotel, three full gyms, two
16-screen cinemas, a driving range,
as well as world-class shopping and
dining at its six-story indoor mall
and three star Michelin-rated
restaurant with rotating views of the
spectacular Hong Kong skyline -- all
within its confines...

-- we see cutaways of each feature, happy people enjoying
every amenity.

SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
...And that's just half the story!

A DIVIDING LINE bisects the building halfway up...

SOOTHING VOICE (cont'd)
Next month, The Pearl will open its
upper half to permanent residents --
already sold out, with a ten year
waiting list, these luxury apartments
will serve as home to many of China's
most successful citizens. With Pangu
Park -- the world's first fully
functional high rise garden --
located on the hundredth floor,
residents will have their every
possible need met, from outdoor sun
to indoor fun -- you'll never need to
leave The Pearl!

It's then we PULL BACK to reveal we're...
12.

INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - DAY

A stunning three-bedroom apartment on the 98th floor with
jaw-dropping views. Henry and Georgia are transfixed by the
television playing the promotional video...

SOOTHING VOICE
But that's not all. The Pearl's
crowning achievement -- the singular
feature that makes this building
unlike any other, anywhere else in
the world is...

..-but just before we reveal what that might be, the TV cuts
off. Henry and Georgia turn to see Sarah standing there.

SARAH
TV goes off, shoes on. It's Panda
Time!

Excited, Georgia zips up her PANDA HOODIE, pulling the cowl
over her head, turning her into a mini-Panda bear.

SARAH (cont'd)
Nice, Georgia. Subtle.
(beat)
Where's your dad?

HENRY
Bathroom.

GEORGIA
He's talking to himself again.

INT. THE PEARL - BATHROOM - DAY

Dressed nicely, Will ties the laces on his BROWN WINGTIP.
Only the shoe is facing him on the bathroom sink counter,
attached to his PROSTHETIC LEG -- a handy way to do it.

He talks to himself in the mirror as he goes, practicing the
Chinese phrase over and over, stumbling every time. Will
shakes his head muttering to himself...

WILL
Screw it. I'm just gonna high-five
the guy.

Finished tying his shoe, Will uses a Kleenex to wipe off a
smudge on it, then tosses the tissue paper into the toilet.

(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:

Will attaches his prosthesis, sliding his pant leg down over
it. He goes to flush the toilet but can't find the

handle -- there doesn't seem to be one. It's a mystery.
Will looks at a BIZARRE ARRAY of touchscreen buttons next to
the toilet -- none of which look like "flush". He presses
one and gets a BIDET SPRAY right in the kisser.

One cue, Sarah walks in.

SARAH
Everything okay in here?

WILL
Yep, just thought I'd take a shower
in the toilet.
Sarah walks over...

WILL (cont'd)
It's broken. We should call--

.»..and presses a button, the toilet flushes normally.

WILL (cont'd)
I was gonna pick that one next.

SARAH
Sure you were, big guy.

Sarah fixes Will's outfit, drying him off, fussing over him.
SARAH (cont'd)

Hey -- you think it's weird that
we're the only ones on this floor?

WILL
We're the only ones on any floor from
the 96th on up -- so not really.
SARAH

No, I mean why not put us up in the
hotel in the bottom half? Why give
us an entire ghost town floor to
ourselves?

WILL
I don't know -- maybe he's trying to
impress us.

SARAH

You think a billionaire, real estate
tycoon is trying to impress us?

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: (2)

WILL
You think I'm reaching?

SARAH
I think you drive a Kia. So, yeah.

WILL
I'm just saying: don't over-think it.

SARAH
Have you met me?

Will smiles, grabs his jacket, closes his LAPTOP and puts it
in his SHOULDER BAG.

SARAH (cont'd)
Horace is coming to get you?

WILL
Any minute now.
SARAH
Can I just say one thing?
WILL
I doubt it.
SARAH

Don't give him any money.

WILL
He's not going to ask me for money.

SARAH
How do you know?

WILL
Because he's head of security for
this entire building and they pay him
for that.

Will and Sarah move into the other room and tag-team getting
Georgia and Henry ready, backpacks, shoes, etc. Will puts
Georgia's hair into a ponytail, clearly he's had practice.
SARAH
And how much of that does he double
down with?

Will frowns. Moves toward the front door, Sarah follows.

(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED: (3)

WILL
That's not -- he doesn't have a
gambling problem.

SARAH
Not anymore -- you helped him.
WILL
Look, that was three years ago -- he

got in over his head with the wrong
kind of people. He would've done the
same thing for me. He made a
mistake -- we all make mistakes.
(beat)
And he's sticking his neck out for
me. They could've gone with a higher
profile guy to handle the security
assessment but he put in a good word.
He's the reason we're here -- and we
could use the money.

SARAH
You have a soft spot for him. That's
all I'm saying.
DING-DONG. Doorbell. They look at each other -- time's up.

SARAH (cont'd)
You're a big dummy. You know that?

WILL
You married me.
SARAH
I'm a sucker for handsome. Sue me.
WILL
Love you.
SARAH

Love you too, neck-bolts.

Will laughs. They kiss. The kids go, "Ewww". Will looks
at his twins...

WILL
Okay team, daddy's gotta go make the
bacon. But let me ask you one thing
before I go...

Will points to Henry.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (4)

WILL (cont'd)
Daddy loves who?

HENRY
Me!

Will points to Georgia...

WILL
Daddy loves who?

GEORGIA
Me!

Will rapidly points between them repeating his question,
each time they shout out, "Me!" at the top of their lungs.

Finally, Will kisses each of them on the tops of their
heads. Sarah watches the sweet moment, sighing...

SARAH
I gotta get a chant.

Will winks at her, then moves to the door, opening it to
reveal Horace his second-in-command from his HRT days and
the only other member of the team to survive the blast.

Nearly Will's size, with some telltale BURN SCARS on his
cheek and neck, Horace offers up a big smile.

HORACE
Brother.

WILL
Brother.

The two friends embrace. The observant might notice
Horace's right hand is severely misinformed -- mangled from
the explosion. The hug breaks and Horace spots Sarah...

HORACE
Sarah -- you look beautiful.

SARAH
Nice to see you, Horace.

Sarah gives Horace a polite hug just as Henry and Georgia
arrive. Horace can't believe it.

HORACE
These are the twins? Wow -- are they
driving yet? You guys remember your
Uncle Horace?

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED: (5)

GEORGIA
No.
HENRY
We're going to see the pandas.
HORACE
Yes -- I heard. That's why I got you

guys a little something.
Horace pulls out a trio of GOLD TICKETS.

HORACE (cont'd)
These'll let you stay for the
nighttime feeding -- after they close
Ocean Park to everyone else. Very
hard to get.

He hands the tickets to Sarah.

WILL
That's amazing. Thank you, H.
SARAH
What do you guys say?
HENRY
Thank you.
WILL
Georgia?
GEORGIA

Are you gonna ask my dad for money?

Off of Will's look we move to...

INT. THE PEARL - INNER ATRIUM - DAY

Horace and Will move toward the cylindrical INNER ATRIUM of
The Pearl, an open-air center column that runs from the
ground floor to the very top of the structure.

The internal circumference is lined with a series of GLASS
ELEVATORS and SKYWAY BRIDGES that span the vast opening,
connecting various floors directly, giving the space the look
of a BRAIN STEM with synapses firing.

Horace jabs the button, they wait.

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

WILL
Sorry about that. Georgia doesn't
have a filter. Sarah thinks she
takes after me.

HORACE
Why, does she cry at sports movies
too?

DING. Elevator arrives. Horace and Will step on.

INT. THE PEARL - ELEVATORS - DAY

This GLASS ELEVATOR travels up the INNER ATRIUM -- a
sphincter-clenching ride if you're afraid of heights.

Will looks through the glass: elevators rise and fall,
gleaming in natural sunlight. He marvels...

WILL
You hear that?

Horace strains an ear. Shakes his head.

HORACE
I don't hear anything.

WILL
Exactly. These are mag-lev elevators
They work on magnetic induction --
like the bullet trains in Japan, only
vertical. No cables, no wires,
nothing. No one's ever built any
that go this high. It's bleeding
edge stuff.

HORACE
Huh. No kidding.

WILL
How do you not know that?

HORACE
They hired me to protect it, not give
tours. But lemme guess: you spent
the last six months studying every
nut, bolt and blueprint of this damn
place.

Will looks away. Horace knows him too well. He teases...

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:

HORACE (cont'd)
Come on, tell me I'm wrong.

WILL
You're wrong.
(beat)
It was eight months.

Horace shakes his head...

HORACE
You know he's not gonna ask you to
build the thing from scratch, right?

WILL
I like details.

HORACE
Nerd.

Will chuckles.

HORACE (cont'd)
Hey -- you hear they switched
insurance guys on you?

WILL
No Singh?

HORACE
No Singh. Singh go bye-bye.

WILL
Huh. They say why?

HORACE
Official word, he got sick.
Unofficial word, he got sick of the
boss man's speeches.

WILL
He gives speeches?

HORACE
You ever met a billionaire who doesn't?

WILL
I've never met a billionaire.

HORACE

Well stick around, this is China --
we got a million of 'em.

(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED: (2)

Ding. The elevator doors open. They step off.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Horace leads Will across an opulent, sunlit private floor
stopping at a pair of imposing DOUBLE DOORS.

WILL
(re: the doors)
Wow -- those are them, right? The

titanium doors from the blueprints?
HORACE

Nothing says welcome to my penthouse

panic room better than ten inches of

military-grade super alloy.

WILL
Subtle.

Horace holds his hand against a wall-mounted scanner.

HORACE
Ready to meet Oz?

The double doors swing open.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE - DAY

Horace leads Will past the foot-thick Titanium doors into a
penthouse to end all penthouses.

Three floors, exquisitely designed, impeccably furnished and
offering up staggering panoramic views. This palace in the
sky is fit not for a king, but a Pharaoh.

Will takes it in...

WILL
I mean, I guess if you gotta live
somewhere...

HORACE
Right?

Will notices a framed BLACK BELT and ceremonial CHINESE
SWORD on the wall next to him.

WILL
He's a black belt?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

21.

HORACE
In the same way Doctor Dre is a
doctor. Heard he built them a brand
new dojo after he "earned" it.

WILL
Hey -- Sarah thinks I should doa
Chinese thing when I meet him.

HORACE
Chinese thing?

WILL
Like say some words. A greeting.

HORACE
In Chinese?

WILL
Cantonese. But yeah. You know, to
show respect.

HORACE
I wouldn't.

WILL
Why?

HORACE

Because you suck at languages and
you'll probably mess it up and
embarrass yourself.

WILL
But other than that?

ZHAO (0.S.)
Mr. Ford.

The moment interrupted, Will and Horace turn to see ZHAO
(30s), a Chinese Elon Musk and the dashing visionary behind
The Pearl, come gliding down a staircase toward them flanked
by a handful of SUITS and a discrete PRIVATE SECURITY DETAIL.

ZHAO
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Zhao speaks nearly perfect English, a hallmark of his Oxford

education.

says...

They shake hands. Will glances at Horace then

WILL
Hou hot sam sik dou nei.

(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED: (2)

Will nailed it. Zhao smiles, impressed. Horace is slack-
jawed. Zhao rattles off a response in rapid-fire Cantonese.

Finished, the billionaire waits expectantly on Will to
answer. Will, of course, has no idea what Zhao just said.
A pregnant pause, then Zhao lets him off the hook...

ZHAO
I'm kidding.

Will exhales.
WILL

Oh, thank god. My wife only taught
me one phrase.

ZHAO
Sarah, right?
WILL
Yes.
ZHAO
And your children, Henry and
Georgia -- twins?
WILL

You do your research.

ZHAO
I've got a good team around me. But
I wasn't aware that your wife speaks
Cantonese. I thought she was a Naval
surgeon.

WILL
She is. But she minored in language
and East Asian studies at Annapolis.
She was gonna work for Doctors
Without Borders in rural China after
her service.

ZHAO
What happened?

WILL
She met someone who needed her more.

Zhao smiles. Just then, a stuffy British pencil-pusher, MR.
PIERCE interrupts the moment. Zhao pivots to him warmly.

(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED: (3)

ZHAO
Mr. Ford, allow me to introduce Mr.
Pierce from the Hawthorne/Stone
Insurance Group, the company lucky
enough to underwrite The Pearl.

Mr. Pierce smiles thinly, extending his hand.

MR. PIERCE
A pleasure.

WILL
Likewise.

ZHAO
Mr. Singh is ill.

WILL
I heard.

ZHAO

At any rate, I hope your family is
enjoying their stay in Hong Kong.

WILL
We've got the whole floor to
ourselves -- what's not to love?
ZHAO

Sorry if I went a little overboard --

I guess I was trying to impress you.
(beat)

Shall we begin?

Zhao motions and the group moves off.

INT. PENTHOUSE - BOARDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zhao stands in front of a WALL-SIZED TOUCH SCREEN which
displays a 3D rendering of The Pearl. Zhao rotates and
resizes the display as he speaks.

Will sits with his laptop open, Horace next to him.
Opposite them, the THREE SUITS and Mr. Pierce.

ZHAO
...with our cutting edge solar arrays
and proprietary wind-harnessing
technology, The Pearl has a negative
environmental footprint -- even at
full occupancy, we'll actually give

The residential upper half, with our
24-hour surveillance & security,
redundant off-site fire control
systems, and on-site emergency
medical staff, will be the safest,
most luxurious living in all of
China, if not the world. We even
have our very own dedicated cell

tower -- so you'll never miss a call
even when you're a mile in the air.
(beat)

The Pearl is not just the future of
China but it is, in a very real
sense, The Future itself.

The suits clap like ass-kissers. Annoyed, Zhao waves at
them to cease. He looks to Will...

ZHAO (cont'd)
What do you think?

WILL
Me?

ZHAO
Yes, of course.

Unsure of the politics of how to respond, Will goes with...

WILL
It's, uh, neat.

ZHAO
Neat?

WILL

Yeah, real neat.

Mr. Pierce jumps in...

Sick burn.

MR. PIERCE
I think what Mr. Ford is trying to
say is that it would be imprudent of
someone in his position to make any
comment whatsoever about The Pearl's
qualities, aesthetic or otherwise.
(beat)

With all due respect, he's not much
more than a glorified security guard.

Will's jaw tightens. He gives Mr. Pierce a cold

look but toes the party line...

(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED: (2)

WILL
He's right. I'm only here as a
certified independent third party to
assess your safety and security
measures and, if they're compliant,
sign off on them so Mr. Pierce's
company can give you the thumbs up to
officially open the top half of your
building. It's not really my place
to comment.

ZHAO
I know why you're here, Mr. Ford.
And I know it's not your place to

comment -- which is precisely why I'm
asking you to. Please, your honest
opinion.

WILL

It's been my experience that when
people ask for someone's honest
opinion, that's usually the last
thing they want.

ZHAO
Humor me.

Will glances at Mr. Pierce who gives him a stiff "go ahead"
nod. Will clears his throat.

WILL
Well, let me start by saying that
what you've built here is truly
incredible. You should be proud.

ZHAO
But...?

WILL
But...if it were up to me, I would
never insure this building. Not ina
million years.
Mr. Pierce eyes Will sternly. The room tightens.

ZHAO
And why is that?

(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED: (3)

WILL

You've built a vertical city here,
Mr. Zhao, which is impressive sure,
but you've brought with it every
single fire, safety and security
challenge I can think of -- and
you've not only brought them all
indoors, you've trapped them three
thousand feet in the air.

(beat)
Everything in this building has to go
right every single time and too
little has to go wrong once for there
to be a very serious problem without
a viable solution.

(beat)
Look, I'm a simple man. I like my
beer cold, my wings hot and fireworks
on the 4th of July. But if you're
asking for my honest opinion about
what you've built here, it would be
this: I don't get it.

Then Will looks at Mr. Pierce.

WILL (cont'd)
But, Hell, I'm just a glorified
security guard. So what do I know?

The room sucks in. Mr. Pierce shoots daggers at Will. But
Zhao smiles and says with all sincerity...

ZHAO
Wonderful. Now I know I can trust
you.

Zhao pulls out a TRANSLUCENT FLASH DRIVE.

ZHAO (cont'd)
This drive contains the machine codes
for The Pearl's fire and safety
control measures -- a master key, if
you will, to the entire building.
They're linked to your laptop alone
and, once installed, will only be
accessible for a twenty-four hour
window before self-deleting. I trust
that will be enough time for you to
thoroughly vet our security and
submit your final analysis for Mr.
Pierce's approval?

(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED: (4)

WILL
More than enough. Thank you.

Zhao slides the FLASH DRIVE to Will who uploads it onto his
laptop. A COUNTDOWN CLOCK ticks down from 24 hours.

Zhao glides to the door and looks back expectantly...

ZHAO
Come on, if we hurry there's still
time.

WILL

Time for what?

ZHAO
For you to get it.

Zhao smiles. Will looks a little confused.

EXT. THE PEARL - OBSERVATION DECK - DAY

And finally we see it -- the crowning achievement of this
incredible structure, and the very thing that gives the
building its name:

A STUNNING 360-DEGREE GEODESIC DOME

 

encases the upper most echelon of The Pearl -- an
observation deck fashioned entirely out of laser-cut
crystalline glass whose triangular facets fit so perfectly,
one into the next, that they almost disappear entirely.

What's more, the footprint of the glass deck itself extends
beyond the profile of the building's rooftop allowing for
the stout-hearted to walk out beyond the roof and look
straight down to the ground, nearly a mile below.

It's nothing short of breath-taking.

We find Zhao and Will up here alone. Will takes in the
sight dumb-founded. Zhao stares across the Victoria Harbor.

ZHAO
I grew up over there, across the
water on the Kowloon side. My father
sold fish. His father sold fish and
his father before him. So I grew up
selling fish. Every morning up
before the sun. Bone tired in the
boat as it went down.

ZHAO (cont'd)

(beat)
When I was six years old, our house
was burned to the ground by some men
my father refused to pay. They
killed him that same night when he
confronted them in the street.

(beat)
My mother raised me and my eight
brothers in sisters in a one-room
house smaller than my bathroom is
now. At night, I remember staring at
this very skyline through our window,
as my brothers and sisters slept --
knowing someday I would make my mark,
someday I would change what I saw out
that window. And no one would ever
take it from me.

WILL
I'm sorry for your loss. But why are
you telling me all this?

ZHAO
Because you and I aren't so different
from each other, Mr. Ford. We're
both men from humble beginnings who
shaped the world around us, not the
other way around.

WILL
Yeah -- next time remind me to invite
you to my skyscraper.

Zhao chuckles.

ZHAO
Touché.

Zhao checks his watch then glances at the sun, doing a
calculation in his head.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Walk out there and turn around.

Unsure but curious, Will walks out onto the EXTENDED DECK,
the section. He turns back to face Zhao.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Once we open The Pearl, the place
you're standing on right now will
become the newest wonder of the
modern world. A testament to what we
can do.

Count to three and you'll see what I
mean.

Uncertain but game, Will plays along...

WILL
One...two...three.

On three, the sun hits a certain point in the sky, its rays
striking the geodesic dome just so, causing the light to
refract perfectly, bouncing off of each precisely placed
facet resulting in a jaw-dropping effect.

Suddenly, as if by magic, the deck, the glass, the entire
dome itself, everything -- COMPLETELY VANISHES.

Out on the extended deck, a sheer 3,000 foot drop below him,
it looks as though Will is standing on nothing at all,
suspended in mid-air.

ZHAO
Welcome to heaven, Mr. Ford.
EXT. HONG KONG OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY
The Pearl looms in the distance, the sun low on the horizon.

The street is choked with PEOPLE and VENDORS hawking their
goods. We find Will and Horace waiting at a NOODLE STAND.

HORACE
Welcome to heaven? He really said
that?
WILL
Yep.
HORACE
But like cool or creepy?
WILL
Kinda both.
HORACE
Rich guys.

Will blows on his hands, it's a bit nippy out.
WILL

I didn't think Hong Kong got this
cold.

(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:

HORACE
Chinese New Year around the corner.
Always the coldest month.

WILL
Think it'll snow?

HORACE
Are you serious? We're almost at the
equator. At sea level.

WILL
All I'm saying is my leg knows when
it's gonna snow -- and it's barking
right now.

HORACE

Your leg is a moron. I think it's
snowed like once here in two-hundred
years.

WILL
So you're saying there's a chance.

Horace rolls his eyes. The VENDOR hands over two cartons of
noodles. They scoop them up and move off, landing us on

A RAT-FACED MAN

lurking nearby, clocking Will and Horace with intent. He
moves out, stalking the duo.

We track with Will and Horace as they move through the
throng, immersing ourselves in the vibrant sights and sounds
of a bustling Hong Kong street market.

HORACE
Best noodles in town -- 90% why I
live around the corner.

WILL
I thought you lived at The Pearl.

HORACE
Hell no. Can't afford it.

WILL
I just thought he'd want you there
for security.

HORACE
I run security for the building not
him.

HORACE (cont'd)
He's got his own private outfit, they
been with him for a while. Plus with
this bad boy...

Horace raises his crippled hand.
HORACE (cont'd)
..-body detail isn't really in the
cards for me.

That hits Will hard. Horace notices.

HORACE (cont'd)

Hey -- I didn't mean to--

WILL
No, it's okay. It's fine. It's the
truth.

They walk in silence for a beat.

WILL (cont'd)
I see that boy's face sometimes, you
know? When I can't sleep. The wife
and daughter too. All of them.

HORACE
You talk to somebody?

WILL
Sarah. A counselor a couple times.
But it's never gone away. Not
completely. The weird part is I
don't think I'd want it to, you know?

Horace nods, feeling for his friend. The pair stop. Will
looks away, barely holding it together in this moment.

The Rat-Faced Man, sensing his chance, SNAPS OPEN A
SWITCHBLADE and closes in on Will and Horace...

WILL (cont'd)
I couldn't save them, I couldn't save
the team. I couldn't save anyone.
HORACE
Hey -- that's not on you. Will --
look at me.

Will does.

(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED: (3)

HORACE (cont'd)
That's not on you -- okay? The team
knew the risks going in. We all
signed up for it. We knew the risks.
That's not yours to carry.

WILL
Thank you.

HORACE
Now, I'd hug you in public, but I
don't want people to think we're
dating.

Will laughs, unaware as the Rat-Faced Man approaches behind
him raising his blade and looking for all the world like
he's about to stab Will in the back.

Will senses something behind him. He turns just as the Rat-
Faced man swings the blade -- slicing the strap on Will's
LAPTOP BAG and TAKES OFF RUNNING WITH IT, vanishing into the
flow of the market.

HORACE (cont'd)
I got him.

Horace bolts after the thief, rushing headlong into the
throng of MARKET GO-ERS.

Not one to sit on the sideline, Will scan the area quickly
spotting:

A DOUCHEBAG ON A DUCATI.

leaning against his red metal phallus, revving the throttle
at a pair of PRETTY GIRLS passing by. He moves off his bike
to call after them. They ain't having it.

The Douchebag turns back just in time to see Will swinging
his leg over the Ducati 959.

WILL
Next time try flowers.

VRROOM! Will takes off in a blur.

EXT. HONG KONG MARKET / INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER

Horace runs full tilt after the Rat-Faced Man, pushing
BYSTANDERS aside. He's closing in on him but just then the
Rat-Faced Man wheels, pulling out a Glock and firing --
BLAM-BLAM-BLAM!

(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:

MARKET GO-ERS scream and scatter. Horace dives behind a
trashcan -- .40 caliber rounds sparking off it.

Utter chaos as the thief spots a MOTORCYCLE RIDER stopped at
the light in front of him.

He points the business end of his Glock at the biker,
commandeering the ride and tearing out of there just as
Horace comes to a running stop, defeated.

Suddenly, another roar. Horace spins, narrowly jumping out
of the way as Will, riding hell-bent for leather on the
Ducati, rips past him in hot pursuit.

And now we find ourselves in...

A _(reasonably-priced) HONG KONG STYLE MOTORCYCLE CHASE,
weaving between ONCOMING TROLLEYS and throughout the
precarious inclines and narrow streets of Hong Kong proper.

All of this ends when Will draws even with the thief and
leaps from his motorcycle, tackling the assailant to the
ground into a

TRASH-STREWN ALLEY
The Rat-Faced Man goes down hard, dropping his gun.

Will gets to his feet first and goes to lay hands on him but
the shifty thief pulls out his SWITCHBLADE and takes a
swing, slicing Will on the arm. He jumps back clutching the
wound, blood already starting to pour.

The Rat-Faced Man bounces to his feet and squares off with
Will, a man twice his size.

A cornered animal, he attacks, swinging wildly. Will is
surprisingly agile -- especially so considering his leg.

Will dodges one lunge, then another. He's got this guy timed
now -- and on the assailant's third attempt, Will catches
the Rat-Faced Man's wrist, snapping it in one precise move.

The Rat-Faced Man howls in pain, dropping the knife. Will
clocks an INTRICATE TATTOO on the thief's forearm.

The Rat-Faced Man scrambles back, looking down at Will's
feet where the discarded GLOCK rests. The thief looks to
Will, then the gun -- is Will gonna pick it up?

Just then, an out-of-breath Horace comes rushing around the
corner, spotting the standoff.

(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED: (2)

Will reaches down BUT DOESN'T PICK UP THE GUN -- instead he
picks up his LAPTOP BAG and kicks the gun away.

The Rat-Faced Man isn't going to stick around to find out
why. He takes off running in the other direction.

Horace joins Will as the duo watch the little man run off.

CUT TO:
A DEAD GUARD
slumped lifelessly on the floor of his GUARD BOOTH. A fresh
bullet hole in his forehead. A WOMAN'S HAND reaches into
frame and yanks the ACCESS CARD off of his shirt. We pan
off the guard with the woman's hand, revealing we're...
EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - NIGHT
A LOW-SLUNG CONCRETE BUILDING on the outskirts of the city.
THREE SILHOUETTES - the woman flanked by TWO MEN -- move
away from the guard booth and toward the building.
INT. OFF-SITE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

SIX WORKERS man a CONTROL STATION at this secure off-site
facility. Only today it's not so secure.

The door opens. The workers turn to see XIA (pronounced
"Shi-ya") standing in the doorway holding the access card.

A slip of a woman with a pixie cut and a pretty smile, Xia

flashes it just before she pulls out two silenced 9mms and
rips off SIX SHOTS, dispatching each worker in turn.

(CONTINUED)
35.

Xia enters when suddenly two HEAVY DUTY GUARDS appear out of
nowhere right on top of her -- a surprise.

In a blink, Xia launches herself, climbing the guards like a
jungle gym as she applies some deft and deadly Black Widow
scissor kick action, ending it with a coup de grace by
simultaneously shooting each guard with the others gun.

It's all over in under three seconds.

Xia pops up. Blows a stray strand hair out of her face and
moves off nonchalantly revealing the two men she came in
with, a TECHIE and a TOUGH GUY, standing in the doorway
having just watched her in action.

The boys share a look: do not fuck this with chick. They
move into the room to do their job.

The TECHIE, dumps a rag-dolled worker out of his chair and
pulls himself up to the control board, going to work...

TECHIE
I can get access to nominal
control -- but anything above the

95th floor, in the residential
section, will require the baseline
machine code.

XIA
You'll have what you need, just make
sure I get what I need.

The Tough Guy's cellphone rings. He answers. His face goes
sour. He hangs up. Shakes his head. Xia nods.

XIA (cont'd)
Time for Plan B.

HORACE (PRE-LAP)
How come you didn't pick up his gun?
INT. HORACE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A well-appointed but modest one-bedroom apartment on the
second floor. Horace inspects Will's wound.

WILL
What do you mean?

HORACE

I mean you could've picked it up but
you didn't. Why?

(CONTINUED)
36.

CONTINUED:
WILL
I don't know. I haven't touched one
in such a long time -- I guess I just

didn't want to hurt anybody today.
There's more to it, but Horace leaves it alone. He stands.
HORACE
You're gonna need stitches. I'11l get
my kit.

Horace stands up and moves into the adjacent BATHROOM and
starts digging out his med kit.

Will's phone rings. Sarah is FaceTiming him. He answers.

WILL
Hey baby -- how are the pandas?

But, surprisingly, Sarah is back at The Pearl. [INTERCUT AS
NECESSARY].

SARAH
We didn't really get to see them --
Henry ate some weird candy and
started throwing up, so we came back.

IN THE BATHROOM

Horace gets a text message. He reads it. Looks at himself
in the mirror -- a haunted man stares back.

IN THE PEARL

Sarah ushers Henry and Georgia off the elevator and toward
their luxury apartment door.

WILL
Is he okay? Did he have an attack?

SARAH
No, his breathing is fine. No fever or
anything, he just needs to lie down.

WILL

Okay -- I'm coming back right now.
SARAH

Don't rush -- we're cool. Just, you

know, no pandas. Which sucks.

Henry chimes in...

(CONTINUED)
37.

HENRY
It sucks!

SARAH
Don't say "sucks", honey.

WILL
We'll go tomorrow, buddy. If you're
feeling better.

(to Sarah)
Alright, I'm gonna hustle back. Love
you.
SARAH
Love you.

Sarah hangs up, unlocking the door to their apartment when
suddenly out of an adjacent APARTMENT DOOR, SIX SECURITY
GUARDS appear, carrying HEAVY BLACK DUFFLE BAGS, two of them
wheeling a HANDCART with a CONTAINER on it. They stop short
at the sight of Sarah and her kids.

The LEAD SECURITY GUARD, sporting a Samurai topknot haircut,
smiles kindly...

LEAD SECURITY GUARD
Sorry, miss. We thought this floor
was empty.

SARAH
Yeah -- me too.

The kids stare at the men. It's a strangely charged moment.
Sarah notices a faded word stenciled on the container:

TMlapalmlwot

Sarah doesn't know what it means but her Spidey-sense starts
tingling. Something about these guys isn't right.

SARAH (cont'd)
Everything okay?

LEAD SECURITY GUARD
Everything's fine. Routine floor
check.

SARAH
Takes six guys to check an empty
floor, huh?

The Lead Security Guard smiles tightly.

(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED: (3)

LEAD SECURITY GUARD
We like to be thorough.

SARAH
I'll say.

LEAD SECURITY GUARD
You have a nice night, ma'am.

With that, the team moves down the hall toward an EXIT DOOR,
one of the Guards shoots a glance over his shoulder,
clocking her. He asks under his breath...

GUARD
Want me to clean that up?

LEAD SECURITY GUARD
Nah. It'll take care of itself.

They push through the exit door, disappearing downward.
Sarah watches them go.

GEORGIA
Mom -- were those guys the police?

SARAH
No, honey. They're not the police.

Her mind ticking, Sarah hovers her thumb over Will's number
about to call him back. Then she thinks better of it and
pockets her phone, opening the door and ushering her kids
inside. A beat later and we hear her throw the deadbolt.

CUT TO:
WHITE SAND

being poured onto the ground. We're...

INT. THE PEARL - 96TH FLOOR LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

The six guards, now sporting serious CHEMICAL MASKS pour out
streams of GRANULATED WHITE POWDER over every surface as
though they were salting a road -- a winter wonderland.

The Lead Guard holds the exit door open as his team moves
past him, pulling off their masks and heading up the stairs.

The last man standing, The Lead Security Guard, his hand

poised above a RED FIRE ALARM HANDLE, takes in the powdered
landscape in front of him: a entirely frosted floor.

(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:

He yanks down the alarm handle and exits through the door.
We wait in the 96th floor lobby as the alarm blares.
Emergency lights flash. Then the SPRINKLER SYSTEM engages,
dousing the entire floor with a wet down from on high.

BUT THE MOMENT THE WATER HITS THE POWDER, IT IGNITES.

INT. HORACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Will hangs up. In the bathroom, Horace looks concerned. He
calls out to Will...

HORACE

They went back to The Pearl?
WILL

Henry wasn't feeling well.
HORACE

That's too bad.
WILL

Yup -- no pandas.

But something else is bugging Will...

WILL (cont'd)
Hey -- did you notice the ink on that
guy's forearm?

HORACE
Who the little guy?

WILL
Yeah.

HORACE

Didn't notice.
Horace grabs his med kit and exits into
THE LIVING ROOM

where Will continues...

WILL
Looked like an affiliation -- maybe
gang ink. I'11l sketch it out for the

cops.

(CONTINUED)
40.
CONTINUED:

HORACE
We're not gonna call the cops.

Horace's voice has changed, it's colder now, darker...

HORACE (cont'd)
You couldn't just let him take the
bag, could you? Had to be a hero.
Always gotta be the hero.

WILL
What are you talking about--

Horace pulls out a .45 AUTOMATIC from the med bag and points
it squarely at his friend. Will stands, wary...

HORACE
I tried to do this clean -- but now
you're gonna have to take the fall
for all of it.

WILL
Whoa -- H -- what's going on? Talk
to me. Put the gun down and let's
talk.

HORACE
I don't have a choice -- I don't have

a fucking choice now. It's too late.
You messed it up. Why'd you have to
mess it up?

WILL
Slow down--

HORACE
I'm sorry.

-- BANG! Horace fires just as Will dives out of the way,
taking cover behind the kitchen counter divide.

Horace rounds that corner and pulls the trigger but Will has
already closed the gap, knocking the muzzle aside causing
the shot to go wide, disarming Horace.

The pair find themselves in close quarters hand-to-hand
melee; each man expertly trained. A brutal affair unfolds
as Will and Horace fight to the death.

The confines of the apartment take the brunt as books fall
from bookshelves, lamps are sent crashing, pictures shatter.

Only one man will make it out alive.

(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED: (2)

Horace catches Will with an elbow stunning him; he KICKS OUT
WILL'S PROSTHETIC LEG -- a dirty move -- then sweeps the
other, dropping Will to the floor -- THUD.

Horace spots the wayward .45 and snatches it up, turning to
fire only to have Will use his good leg to kick out
Horace's, dropping him to the floor as well.

Will pounces on top of Horace as the two former teammates
struggle mightily against each other for control of the .45
when suddenly -- BANG.

The gun goes off. A moment as we don't know who got the
worst of it. Then Horace coughs up blood, his eyes rolling
back in his head.

A look of dismay washes over Will's face. He releases his
death grip on his longtime friend.

Without missing a beat, Will checks Horace's injury: a
gunshot wound just below the breast bone. Blood pumps out
rhythmically, air sucks in -- a mortal blow.

Will applies direct pressure with his hand as best he can
but he knows he's gonna need something to stop the bleeding.

WILL
You're gonna be alright -- sit up --
lean forward.

Will maneuvers Horace's body as he starts to wheeze from a
collapsed lung. Horace apologizes, rapidly turning pale.

HORACE
I'm sorry -- I'm sorry --
WILL
Hey -- just stay with me -- Look at
me -- fight it now. You gotta fight it.

Will moves into
THE ADJACENT BATHROOM

and grabs a HAND-TOWEL to help staunch the bleeding. That's
when Will stops short at the sight of:

A_HAND PROTRUDING OUT FROM BEHIND THE SHOWER CURTAIN.

 

Will yanks the curtain back, revealing the BODY OF A DEAD
MAN IN A SUIT, crumpled lifelessly in the tub.

(CONTINUED)
42.
CONTINUED: (3)

Will nearly stumbles at the shocking sight. He rushes out
of the bathroom and back to

THE LIVING ROOM

Where Horace is paper white and not long for this world.
Will kneels down next to him.

WILL (cont'd)

Tell me what's going on -- if you
tell me, I can help you. Horace?
Horace?

HORACE

...They weren't supposed to go
back...they weren't supposed to be
there...
Will's blood goes cold.
WILL
Who wasn't supposed to be there?
(beat)
What did you do?
Horace chokes out a ragged...

HORACE
I -- I'm sorry.

And then he's gone. Will lets go of his friend. And that's
when he hears it: SIRENS. In the distance -- a lot of them.

Will moves to Horace's window, yanking open the blinds to
see a horror unimaginable:

THE PEARL IS ON FIRE.

An entire floor, maybe two, are ablaze halfway up the
building. Based on the silhouette of the structure, Will
knows Sarah and his kids are above the fire line.

His heart sinks.

Then more SIRENS. But these are much closer. Will glances
down to:

THE STREET BELOW

where a swarm of HONG KONG POLICE (HKP) and SWAT VANS
screech to a stop out in front.

(CONTINUED)
43.
CONTINUED: (4)

The van doors open and out pours an ASSAULT TEAM. They
hustle into the apartment building.

His mind racing, Will only has moments to form a plan.
Quickly he snags his prosthesis, securing it to his leg.

He slings his laptop bag and grabs the .45, tucking it away.

He hears HEAVY FOOTFALLS as the assault team ascends the
stairs. Will moves to the door, snugging up against it.

He glances down at his feet -- at first we're not sure why.
Then a little BLACK SNAKE slithers under the door. A FIBER
OPTIC CAMERA.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

the ASSAULT TEAM stacks up. The OPTICS MAN crouches at the
the door working the snake-cam -- its MONITOR showing the
battered apartment and a portion of Horace's slack body.

WILL watches the snake-cam's head twist around and just as
it bends toward him he snatches it up and yanks it hard...

THE OPTICS MAN,

holding the other end of it, is yanked head-first into the
door -- WHAM!

Will opens the door and grabs the dazed Optics Man --
snapping him back into the apartment and shutting the door.

The Assault Team on the other side of the door unloads on
it -- shredding the wood to pieces.

INSIDE THE APARTMENT

Will headbutts the Optics Man out cold, then he snatches a
FLASHBANG GRENADE off of his webbing, pulling the pin.

The limp Optics Man in one hand, Will tosses the flashbang
through one of the GUNSHOT HOLES in the Swiss Cheese door.

Shouts of alarm followed by a THUNDEROUS BANG.

Will opens the door just wide enough to kick the Optics Man
through the opening onto his stunned comrades, knocking a
few of them over like bowling pins.

Will slams the door shut and moves to a STANDING CABINET,
shouldering it, tipping it over to block the front door.

(CONTINUED)
44,
CONTINUED: (5)

The assault team on the other side begins battering the door
open with a METAL RAM. Will only has seconds left.

He races to the window, tearing off the blinds and throwing
open the pane.

CRACK -- the door breaks open and the Assault Team rushes in
just as Will disappears out the window, dropping from sight.
EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Will hits the ground hard -- his leg goes out from under him
as he cries out in pain.

He gathers himself quickly, getting to his feet to find
himself

SURROUNDED.

The HKP have both ends of the alley blocked off. They inch
toward Will from either end, closing in on him like a vice.

Will glances up to see the ASSAULT TEAM in the apartment
aiming down on him from the window above.

He's trapped. It's over. Will puts his hands up, pointing
desperately at The Pearl, ablaze in the skyline...

WILL
My family! My family is trapped in
that building!
But they don't speak English and he doesn't speak Chinese.
WILL (cont'd)
Please! Listen to me! You have to
listen! My family--
BANG!
A shotgun blast strikes Will in the chest -- a non-lethal
BEANBAG round knocking the wind out of him. Then another,
then a third. The big man drops to a knee, weakened, unable
to catch his breath. The HKP close in, subsuming him.
CUT TO:
WILL'S BIG WRISTS

cinched in tiny Chinese handcuffs, as he's led through the
throng of cops toward a waiting POLICE VAN.

(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:

THE PEARL

burns in the distance as Will is shoved into the back of the
van. He looks up longingly at the burning high rise -- the
only people in this world he loves trapped inside.

The van doors close on Will's face revealing the burning
high rise in their blacked-out windows.

The doors recede from us -- moving away from The Pearl, away
from the very place Will wants to be most.

INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Distraught, Sarah finishes leaving a voicemail for Will.

The fire alarm blares. EMERGENCY LIGHTS flash brightly. An

ALARM VOICE repeats itself in CHINESE. Henry and Georgia
look scared. Sarah hangs up and ushers them to the couch.

SARAH
Get on the couch.

GEORGIA
Mom -- what's going on? Are we gonna
be okay?

SARAH

We're going to be fine. There's a
fire in the building, but we're safe

here -- everything's going to be
okay. I'm going to go talk to the
firemen.

Sarah moves into the bathroom and turns on the cold water in
the bathtub, pulling the stopper shut to fill it. She grabs
a towel, rolling it into a tube.

Exiting the bathroom, she kneels down in front of her kids.

SARAH (cont'd)
Look at me: stay on this couch and do
not move until I comeback.
Understand?

Henry and Georgia nod. Sarah hands Georgia her phone.

SARAH (cont'd)
If daddy calls, tell him we're okay
and that I'll be right back.
(beat)
I love you both very much.

(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED:

Sarah kisses them then exits.

INT. THE PEARL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Sarah wedges the rolled up towel against the foot of the
door. Then she goes to the elevators and sees that the
display above the door shows a red FIRE LOGO with an X over
it. Elevators have been automatically disabled.

Sarah finds the FIRE EXIT door and pushes through it.

INT. THE PEARL - FIRE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Sarah moves down from the 98th floor -- instantly feeling a
WALL OF HEAT rushing at her. She pushes on, down one flight
and nearly to the next landing when -- KA-BOOM!

The door to the 96th floor ROCKETS OFF ITS HINGES, slamming
into the wall opposite, crumpling like tinfoil. Hungry for
fresh oxygen, the flames from the raging fire snake through
the new opening into the stairwell.

Sarah scrambles backward -- turning to run back up the way
she came. There's no way down.

EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

Controlled chaos as crowds have gathered to gape at the
unimaginable sight. An adjacent thirty-foot wide HD
BILLBOARD on the side of a NEARBY BUILDING plays the news of
the fire for all to see.

EMERGENCY SERVICES are already on the scene, cordoning off
the area. Amidst it, we find the FIRE CHIEF walking through
the throng talking to the man in charge, CAPTAIN CHAN.

FIRE CHIEF
...Fire's burning unchecked on the
96th. We're evacuating the building
as we speak. Gonna take some time.

CAPTAIN CHAN
What about people above the 96th?
Has anyone contacted them?

FIRE CHIEF
No.

CAPTAIN CHAN
No? Why not?

(CONTINUED)
47.

CONTINUED:
FIRE CHIEF
Because there's no one above the 96th
floor -- it's not open yet.

CAPTAIN CHAN
You're kidding me.

FIRE CHIEF
The owner of the building is in the
penthouse on the 220th -- that's it.

And the fire will never get there.

CAPTAIN CHAN
How do you know that?

FIRE CHIEF
The automatic fire doors and
dampening measures have engaged,
sealing the fire in place. If it
can't go up and it can't go down,
it'll burn itself out in under two
hours, even if we don't do
anything -- no fuel, no fire.

CAPTAIN CHAN
You're telling me the building is
putting out the fire by itself?

FIRE CHIEF
That's an oversimplification, Captain.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Really? Cuz it sounds to me like
you're out of a job, Chief.
With that, Chan yanks open the door to an EMERGENCY OPS
TRAILER, disappearing inside. The Chief follows.
INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

Sarah pushes through the door, coughing. Henry and Georgia
rush to her. She kneels down and hugs her cubs tightly.

GEORGIA
Daddy didn't call.

SARAH
That's okay. Gimme the phone. Let's
try him together.

Sarah dials Will one final time...
48.

EXT. HONG KONG STREET - NIGHT

The Police Van, escorted by HKP on motorcycles, moves through
the crowded streets, sirens wailing.

INT. POLICE VAN - SAME

Will rides wordlessly with the assault team. Suddenly a
BUZZING. Will glances at his laptop bag -- he can see his

phone in the mesh webbing of one of its outer pockets.

It's Sarah's face. She's calling him. It's nothing short
of torture for Will as he's feet away but can do nothing.

WILL
Answer it!

The assault team ignores him.

WILL (cont'd)
ANSWER MY PHONE!

Will tries to answer it himself, moving to get up when he
takes the butt of a rifle to the gut for his trouble.

Will crumples. Coughing. His phone shows the missed call

from Sarah. Wills swings his gaze to a SMIRKING GUARD.
Will's eyes narrow, he's gonna--

WHAMMMMM!

OUR WORLD GOES UPSIDE DOWN. We're trapped in a violent
clothes dryer as we spin and tumble.
EXT. HONG KONG STREET - SAME

The police van is T-boned by a BATTERING RAM TRUCK, sending
it spinning like a rolling pin into the side of a building.

Instantly, a HALF-DOZEN GANGSTERS, sporting CHINESE DRAGON
MASKS, race up in MOTORCYCLES, ambushing HKP officers.

It's over in a blink as the Gangsters cut down the cops.
INT. POLICE VAN - SAME

It's dark in here. The interior van light stutters, offering
an eerie strobe effect. We're completely upside down.

(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:

GUNFIRE and shouting outside. A turkey shoot underway.

In the back of the van, the Assault Team members groan, some
out cold. Will shakes out the cobwebs just in time to hear
the ROARING WHINE of a gas-powered blade saw.

Suddenly a showering of hot sparks rain down inside the
van -- the doors are being cut open from the outside.

Then a CROWBAR is wedged in prying this prize box open --
one thrust, then two. The doors crack free revealing:

THREE DRAGON-MASKED GANGSTERS,

smoke roiling past their horns in wicked slow motion.

The Smirking Guard goes for his gun but takes two rounds in
the chest from the LEAD GANGSTER. The Lead Gangster swings

the barrel of his carbine to Will.

A moment as it looks like this might be the most expensive
short film in the history of cinema.

But then the Lead Gangster drops his weapon and reaches past
Will, snagging the thing he came for -- the LAPTOP BAG.

The Lead Gangster makes sure the laptop is inside, then he
tosses the bag to a waiting COMRADE on a motorcycle. The
comrade tears ass out of there.

Fast approaching sirens. No time, the masked Gangsters back
away, splitting apart on their motorcycles -- heist complete.

IN THE VAN

Will hears sirens and weighs his options: stay here and stay
arrested or seize the moment and go rescue his family.

For a guy like Will, there's only one answer.

He searches for the CUFF KEYS, finding them on the Smirking
Guard's belt.

Will quickly frees himself, snags a SIDEARM and exits.
OUTSIDE THE VAN

the SIRENS have grown louder, he's got only seconds to make
his escape. BYSTANDERS have begun to gather -- they point

at Will when he appears from the wreckage. Some start
shouting. Many others record it all on their smartphones.

(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED: (2)

Will gets his bearings quickly, scanning the skyline until
he finds what he's looking for, then he heads off in that
direction -- people part like the Red Sea as this massive
maniac with a gun moves toward them.

We swing around Will to reveal his goal: THE PEARL, burning
like a fuse in the night sky.

MATCH CUT TO:
THE PEARL

burning on a TELEVISION SCREEN. We're...

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - NIGHT

Standing in front of his wall-sized touch screen, Zhao
watches his building burn on the local news. If this
worries him, it doesn't show.

The three suits sitting at the table, however, are starting
to sweat. One of them whispers to Mr. Pierce...

SUIT
Helluva first day, huh?

Mr. Pierce swallows hard -- this might be the worst day in
his insurance underwriting life. He speaks up...

MR. PIERCE
Should we evacuate?

ZHAO
Evacuate?

MR. PIERCE

Yes. Take your helicopter.

ZHAO
And why would we do that?

MR. PIERCE
The building's on fire.

ZHAO
The building isn't on fire. The 96th
floor is on fire.

Mr. Pierce nearly scoffs -- he looks at the suits to back
him up. They look away.

(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:

ZHAO (cont'd)
Mr. Pierce, our bodies are the result
of millions of years of evolution.
When faced with heat, we sweat. When
faced with danger, our blood courses
with Adrenaline and Cortisol. When
faced with extreme cold, hypothermia,
our bodies act to conserve heat,
cutting off blood to the extremities
-- any sacrifice to keep the core
warm. The brain. The Pearl is the
same. We're sacrificing one floor,
so that the rest may live.

Zhao nods at a set of security monitors, showing the fire
containment on the 96th floor.

ZHAO (cont'd)
The ninety-sixth floor will burn to
ash, the fire will die and we'll
rebuild it. The Pearl itself will
never be in jeopardy. I assure you.

Just then, the TV News cuts away from its coverage of the
fire to show a STOCK PHOTO OF WILL FORD next to SMARTPHONE
VIDEO of his escape from the overturned HKP Van.
The room goes silent. Zhao un-mutes the screen...
NEWSCASTER

...the American is the prime suspect

in a double-homicide and is wanted

for his apparent connection to the

fire at The Pearl...

Zhao turns to his head of security, a no nonsense Israeli
man named DOV (40s).

ZHAO
Get me answers.

Dov nods and exits. Puzzled, Zhao turns his attention back
to the image of Will on his screen.

MATCH CUT TO:
WILL'S FACE

on the same newscast, playing through a window. We're...
52.

EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - NIGHT
The broadcast plays inside a bar, patrons are rapt by it.

We find Will watching too from an ALLEYWAY. He scans the
area, every TV screen he sees is playing the same thing: his
face right next to the burning Pearl. He's a wanted man.

Will's mind churns: his image is everywhere and he's a foot
taller than everyone in this city -- he'll stick out like a
sore thumb on the street. Unless...

Catercorner, Will spots a BEGGAR in a WHEELCHAIR panhandling.
CUT TO:
THE BEGGAR

looking up at us. A FISTFUL OF CASH is held out to him.
Reveal Will as he brings his finger to his lips: SHHHH. The
Beggar smiles a toothless smile and reaches for the cash.

INT. THE PEARL - PRIVATE RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Georgia submerges bathroom towels in the tub as Sarah kneels
in front of Henry holding an ASTHMA INHALER.

HENRY
I'm fine, mom.

SARAH

You're fine now, honey, but we're
about to go out there and there's a
lot of smoke and bad air and I don't
want you to have an attack, okay?

(to Georgia)
Dunk them all the way, make sure the
whole thing gets wet. The hand
towels too.

Georgia does as she's told. Sarah looks back to her son...

SARAH (cont'd)
Two quick inhales, please?

Henry obliges.

SARAH (cont'd)
Good job. Thank you.
(pocketing it)
I'll have it right here with me if
you need it, okay?

(CONTINUED)
53.

CONTINUED:
HENRY
Okay.
GEORGIA
Mom -- are we gonna die?

The directness of the question stops Sarah short.

SARAH
No honey, we're not gonna die.

HENRY
Where's Dad?

SARAH
He's not here.

HENRY
Is he coming to get us?

They look at their mother. Sarah knows this moment matters.

SARAH
There's nothing in this world that
would stop your father from keeping
you both safe.

HENRY
And you too, right?

SARAH
And me too.

Sarah opens her toiletry kit and takes out a pair of CHROME
SHEARING SCISSORS.

SARAH (cont'd)
Hand me those towels.

EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - NIGHT
A motorcycle rips toward the chain-link fence. The Tough
Guy, now dressed as the security guard, opens the gate.
Clutching Will's laptop bag, the Biker roars through.
INT. OFF-SITE CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The Biker rushes into the room and hands the laptop to Xia.
She tosses it to the Techie who snags it out of the air and

quickly boots it up, gaining access the precious control
protocols he needs.

(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:

XIA
Do it.

ON SCREEN we see full access granted. The Techie expertly
engages all of the anti-fire measures from the 95th down, a
cascade of GREEN COLORED FLOORS all the way to the bottom.

Then he deactivates all of the anti-fire measures from the
96th to the top -- all of those floors BLINK RED.

With a swipe on the touchscreen, the FIRE DOORS from the
97th on up slide open, feeding the fire with fresh air.

ON THE 96TH FLOOR

we see the flames ROAR UPWARD, like a living creature -- a
twisting tornado of fire thirsty for fuel and hungry for
oxygen. The blaze climbs higher -- a kiln burning white-hot.
BACK TO:
TECHIE

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you a
6.5 billion dollar chimney.

XIA
Lock it in.

Some fancy keystrokes add an encryption code to the changes
in the building, effectively making them permanent.

TECHIE
Encrypted.

He pops up and hands Will's laptop to Xia.

TECHIE (cont'd)

You've got full systems control from
that laptop and that laptop only. No
pass code needed. Plug and play.
Everyone else is locked out.

XIA
How long will it take them to crack
your encryption and regain control?

TECHIE
I don't know -- seven hundred years?
I'm the only one who knows the
logarithmic base cipher I used to
encrypt it, so I'm literally the only
person on planet earth who can crack
it. Pretty smart, huh?

(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED: (2)

XIA
Not that smart.

THWIP! One silenced 9mm round to the forehead drops the
Techie. She tucks her gun away and slides Will's LAPTOP
into her messenger bag for safe keeping, pulling out a

GLOSSY BLACK BRICK with a BLINKING RED LIGHT in exchange.

The phone in the control room starts RINGING madly. She
ignores it, placing the black brick on the doorjamb with a
magnetic CHUNK. She activates it and exits.

EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Xia moves away from the facility toward the front gate. She
touches her ear, speaking to someone unseen...

XIA
Heading to on-site.

The Tough Guy looks over from the GUARD SHACK...

TOUGH GUY
We done?

XIA
Yep.

THWIP-THWIP! Two shots in the ten-ring. He's dead before
he hits the ground. She doesn't so much as break stride.

INT. THE PEARL - 98TH FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Choked with smoke. Licks of flame are visible through the
exterior windows, reaching up from below. It's only a
matter of time before the fire claims this floor as well.

The door to the apartment opens, revealing Sarah sporting a
wet hand towel tied around her nose and mouth like a cowboy.
She's cut a hole through the sopping bath towel for her
head, wearing it like a poncho.

She steps into the hallway, holding hands with Henry and
Georgia who are dressed just like her: wet towel mask and
poncho, giving the kids the look of tiny ghost bank robbers.

GEORGIA
Where are we going?

SARAH
Up.
56.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - NIGHT

Zhao stares at his giant WALL MONITOR: every floor above the
95th is BLINKING RED, the anti-fire measures all read as
OFF-LINE. Clearly, something is rotten in Denmark.

The suits are agitated. One sips a bottle of water, his
hand shaking as he does. Mr. Pierce paces, nervous.

MR. PIERCE
I thought you said the fire wouldn't
spread. You said it would be
contained. What's wrong with your
building? Don't you have sprinkler
systems?

ZHAO
Yes and the sprinkler systems on the
96th floor engaged as designed.

MR. PIERCE
Really? Then why didn't the fire go
out?
ZHAO
Because the water caused the fire.
MR. PIERCE
Come again?
ZHAO

It's the only conclusion. And
there's only one way water itself can
cause a fire: through an exothermic
chemical reaction. Which means this
wasn't an accident -- it was arson.

Dov, Zhao's body man, returns...

DOV

Local control is completely locked
out and off-site's not answering.
The entire system's been
compromised -- our techs are trying
to crack it.

(beat)
And there's something else.

ZHAO
What?

(CONTINUED)
57.
CONTINUED:

DOV
Our log codes show Will Ford's family
swiped into their residence two hours
ago, before the fire.

That news puzzles Zhao, but he's got bigger fish to fry...

ZHAO
How long to get control of the
building back?

DOV
I don't think they really know, sir.

ZHAO
What was their estimate?

DOV
Eighteen hours.

The suit drinking the bottle water nearly chokes on it.

MR. PIERCE
Eighteen hours?! We don't have
eighteen minutes! This thing's
burning like a match!

ZHAO
Matches burn from the top down.

MR. PIERCE
Oh fuck you, Buddha! We need to leave!

ZHAO
You're missing my point. With the
fire doors open above the fire and
closed below them, this building
isn't burning like a match -- it's
burning like a kiln. It's super-
heating.

MR. PIERCE
Are you saying it'll collapse?

ZHAO
No -- The Pearl could burn to cinders
and never collapse. Collapse isn't
the issue.

MR. PIERCE
Then what is?

(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED: (2)

ZHAO
The real issue is that the building
doesn't know it's on fire. And if it
doesn't know it's on fire, it can't
act to preserve itself. Which means
the fire will grow hotter and hotter
and spread faster and faster until it
has nothing left to feed on. Until
it eats itself to death. Until it
consumes us whole.

MR. PIERCE
Fantastic. Wonderful. I think we've
all learned something really valuable
here today. I know I have. Now can we
please get on the fucking helicopter?

ZHAO
You know what's interesting about
you, Mr. Pierce?

MR. PIERCE
What?

ZHAO
Nothing.

Dov chimes in, speaking softly...

DOV
Sir, you know as well as I do that if
the fire gets within twenty floors of
us it will over-heat the air around
the helipad making liftoff
impossible. If we're going to
evacuate, we need to do it now.

Zhao weighs the situation. Then he makes his decision.
ZHAO
Alert the authorities that we'll be
departing.

With that, Zhao exits.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT
Zhao moves through his lavish bedroom and into his WALK-IN

CLOSET. Passing racks of $5,000 suits, he stops at the back
wall -- a PANE OF GLASS looks out onto the skyline below.

(CONTINUED)
59.
CONTINUED:

Zhao places his hand on the glass causing hidden scanners to
read his palm print. GREEN BEAMS shoot out from a secret
source behind the glass and scan his retinas.

Suddenly, the pane of glass reveals itself to be a cleverly
constructed false wall -- it's a 6K LED SCREEN playing a
VIDEO IMAGE of the skyline below. A perfect forgery.

The LED PANEL opens inward. Zhao steps through it into...
A VAULT

about the size of a small bathroom. Zhao moves to an old
school 1820's FLOOR SAFE and dials in a combination.

He cracks it open, pulling the heavy door back to reveal a
single object inside: A TINY RED MEMORY CARD, the size of a
thumbnail. Zhao reaches for it.

EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

Tumult as EVACUEES from The Pearl are directed this way and

that way by EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. Meanwhile, hundreds of ON-
LOOKERS, cellphones blazing, stare up at The burning Pearl:

an awesome sight, nothing short of a Towering Inferno™.

Amidst the chaos we find a ONE-LEGGED HOMELESS MAN, dressed
in rags and a tattered ball cap, pushing his way through the
throng in a wheelchair. No one pays him any mind, which is
just how Will Ford likes it.

Will pauses and looks up at the burning skyscraper above
him, the mountain he must climb to rescue his family. The
sheer size of it takes his breath away.

The task seems impossible. Will's mind races -- there has
to be a way. Suddenly he spots the answer. He wheels
toward us as we pivot around him to reveal a:

65-TON SUPER CRANE

perched at the very top of an ADJACENT 90-STORY BUILDING
still under construction.

We hold a beat longer than we might as suddenly XIA STEPS
INTO FRAME. She must've spotted Will. She moves after him.

EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

In the ALCOVE ENTRANCE, a POLICE OFFICER waves the crowd
along: keep it movin' people. Nothing to see here.

(CONTINUED)
60.
CONTINUED:

Will rolls into the alcove in his wheelchair, holding out a
paper cup, shaking it at him -- begging.

The Police Officer scowls, then barks at Will in Chinese.
But Will keeps at it shaking the cup.

Finally, the asshole cop slaps the cup out of Will's hand
and in a blink, Will grabs the man's wrist yanking him down
into a vicious head-butt -- CRACK. The cop goes slack.
Will catches him before he falls.

WILL
Sorry, pal. Next time maybe give a
little.

Quickly, Will hops up on one leg and swaps places with the
police officer, dropping him down into the wheelchair and
covering him up with his ball cap and tattered coat.

Will places the cup in the cop's lap and pushes him forward
just as a PASSERBY tosses some change into the his cup.

WILL (cont'd)
Thanks.

The English startles the Passerby but he keeps moving. Will
locks the wheelchair in place and pulls out his prosthetic
leg from the satchel on the chair-back, attaching it.

Will pats the cop on the shoulder and moves off inside the
building. A beat later, Xia appears in the alcove.

She moves to the officer, digging under his hobo jacket and
unhooks the RADIO MIC from his shoulder...

XIA
Shots fired. Shots fired. Officer
down. Request immediate back-up.
Suspect Will Ford has entered the
Scion Capitol building. Armed &
dangerous.

She presses the barrel of her SILENCED 9MM against the
unconscious officer's chest, and pulls the trigger -- THWIP.

The officer's body jerks from the impact. Xia picks up the
brass cartridge, blowing on it like a lucky penny.
61.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT

Flanked by his second-in-command, LIEUTENANT HAN, Captain
Chan drinks black tea from a paper cup as he moves through
the Ops Trailer, keeping an eye on a series of MONITORS
which play local news broadcasts of the unfolding event.

LIEUTENANT HAN
...Fire Chief says there's nothing he
can do. Water pressure from the
trucks can only hit the 30th floor,
tops. The system crash shut down the
standpipes in the building -- there's
no way to get water up high enough.

CAPTAIN CHAN
So what's he saying?

LIEUTENANT HAN
He's saying it's gonna burn.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Get a team to that off-site control
facility -- we need those systems
back online.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Yes, sir.

CAPTAIN CHAN
What about the guy -- Will Ford.
What do we know?

LIEUTENANT HAN
Marine Corps, Bronze Star, FBI for
six years, Hostage Rescue Team for
eight -- early retirement.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Early?

LIEUTENANT HAN
I guess there was an incident.

CAPTAIN CHAN
What kind of an incident?

LIEUTENANT HAN
We're not clear on it yet.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Get clear.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

62.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Yes, sir.

CAPTAIN CHAN
What about the other guy? The dead
one in the bathtub.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Still no ID on him but medical
examiner says he was killed eight,
maybe ten hours beforehand.

CAPTAIN CHAN
So you're telling me this one-legged
American war hero, travels thirteen
thousand miles -- with his wife and
kids who no one can seem to locate by
the way -- to kill a John Doe this
morning, dump the body in his FBI
buddy's bathtub before offing him too
and then, to kind of round out the
evening, decides to light the tallest
building in the world on fire?
That's where we're at with it?

LIEUTENANT HAN
That's what it looks Like right now,
yeah.

CAPTAIN CHAN
And the attack on the van -- the one
that sprung him -- that's part of this?

LIEUTENANT HAN
Maybe. Maybe not.

CAPTAIN CHAN

Well I don't know about you
Lieutenant, but I think we might win
a medal for our police work here.
Outstanding stuff.

(beat)
How 'bout this: is there anything we
do know for sure?

LIEUTENANT HAN
Zhao's leaving his penthouse by
helicopter. Got word ten minutes ago.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Well, thank god the billionaire's safe.

Lieutenant?

(CONTINUED)

LIEUTENANT HAN
Yes, sir?

CAPTAIN CHAN
Do me a favor? Go find Will Ford.
I'd like to ask him some questions.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Yes, Captain.

Lieutenant Han turns to go but...

CAPTAIN CHAN
Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Sir?

CAPTAIN CHAN
Never mind. Found him.

Captain Chan points a large monitor where we see LIVE NEWS
HELICOPTER FOOTAGE of Will climbing the vertical spire of
the super crane FROM THE OUTSIDE.

CAPTAIN CHAN (cont'd)
Send a strike team.

An OPS TECH chimes in...
OPS TECH

Already there, sir.
EXT. ADJACENT BUILDING - SUPER CRANE - NIGHT
NEWS CHOPPERS circle, blasting Will with their SPOTLIGHTS as
he works his way, inch-by-inch, up the exterior scaffolding
of the 300-hundred foot tall super crane.
ON THE CRANE SPIRE, Will mutters to himself...

WILL
Don't look down...don't look down...

Will looks down -- the height is dizzying. His stomach
drops. He curses himself...

WILL (cont'd)
Stupid.

Then, at the base of the crane, Will spots:

(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:

THE STRIKE TEAM

rushing onto the roof, pointing their weapons up at him.
Their TEAM LEADER hurries to the crane's ENTRY DOOR as the
building's MANAGER unlocks it. The Team Leader throws open
the door and presses the call button for the CRANE CAR.

ON THE CRANE SPIRE

Two-thirds of the way to the top, Will watches as the CRANE
CAR descends past him. Will can't believe it...

WILL (cont'd)
Shit. There was an elevator?

It's only a matter of moments before the elevator reaches
the Strike Team on the roof. No (more) time for jokes, Will
redoubles his efforts, climbing feverishly.

Just then, a JET BLACK POLICE HELICOPTER swoops down from
the night sky like a bird of prey on the hunt.

ABOARD THE POLICE HELICOPTER

we see a SNIPER, sporting serious-looking night vision
goggles, readying his JS 7.62mm bolt-action long gun.

EXT. CRANE CONTROL PLATFORM - NIGHT

At last, Will pulls himself up and onto the CONTROL PLATFORM.

Exhausted by the effort, Will collapses flat on his back for
a second, breathing hard. It's eerily quiet up here.

Will gets to his feet and looks at The Pearl. He's roughly
110 stories up -- above the fire line, above the park even.

Will looks down to the rooftop and sees the STRIKE TEAM
boarding the crane car. Will chides himself...

WILL
Great plan, Will. Way to really
think this through. Now what, genius?

He's got only seconds to do whatever it is he's planning to
do. Will spots the GLASS-ENCASED CONTROL CAR -- inside it a
panel of buttons and a joystick that controls the boom arm.

He moves to it, scanning the area looking for anything to
help him break the door handle and gain access.

(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:

He spots a nearby TOOL CABINET. He rushes to it, yanking it
open to reveal a set of tools -- among them a SLEDGEHAMMER.

Will grabs it and rushes back to the Control Car. He's just
about to bludgeon his way in when he thinks better of it
and -- what the hell -- tries the door handle.

Click.

It opens. Will almost laughs. But the sound of the
approaching elevator snaps him back into the moment. He
rushes over to the platform's ELEVATOR CAGE, grabbing hold
of a LENGTH OF CHAIN and a SCREWDRIVER along the way.

Will slips the thick chain through a STEEL LOOP on the
ELEVATOR CAGE DOOR, securing it with screwdriver. It'll slow
"em down, but only for so long. Will hurries into the

CONTROL CAR

where he turns the crane on. After some quick and comedic
trial & error and he's got the hang of it.

Will rotates the BOOM ARM, swinging it toward The Pearl.
Then he EXTENDS toward the face of the building. The crane
BEEPS an alert -- it can't extend any further. A THIRTY
FOOT GAP remains between the end of the crane and The Pearl.

Will exits the Control Car just as the Strike Team arrives
to find themselves locked in. Immediately, they go to work
on the door, trying to break the makeshift chain lock.

Time running out, Will grabs the sledgehammer and hustles to

THE FAR END OF THE CRANE.

He stares off the end of the diving board, looking at the
building in front of him, calculating something in his mind.

Will moves back a few paces then charges at us, holding the
sledgehammer high and screaming like a medieval warrior...

WILL (cont'd)
Ahhh!!!

Will HURLS the sledgehammer with all his might -- whoosh!
The sledgehammer hurtles through the air, descending
gracefully until it strikes the GLASS EXTERIOR of The Pearl

--CRASH!-- punching through the glass but not shattering it,
sticking there. Will throws up his hands.

(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED: (2)

WILL (cont'd)
Come on. Really?

Clearly, that wasn't the plan.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - SAME

The entire Ops Trailer as well as Captain Chan and
Lieutenant Han watch the events unfold in sheer disbelief.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Why the hell would anyone want to get
IN to a burning building?

Just then, an Ops Tech breaks in, listening to some chatter
on his headset.

OPS TECH
Captain -- word coming in right
now -- we have a location on the

suspect's family.
But Captain Chan already knows the answer...

CAPTAIN CHAN

Don't tell me -- they're in the
building.

OPS TECH
Yes, sir.

EXT. CRANE CONTROL PLATFORM - NIGHT

Will turns from the edge and moves back toward the CONTROL
CAR, when he's hit with a WASH OF BLINDING LIGHT.

The Police Helicopter drops down, calling out a DISTORTED
WARNING IN CHINESE over its loudspeaker as it swings its

body broadside. The light peels away from Will revealing
the SNIPER hanging out of the bay door.

Will's eyes go wide -- BANG! -- a high velocity round cracks
an inch from his head. Will breaks for it, bolting down the
boom arm -- running with everything he's got.

The sniper fires again and again but Will's inside the
scaffolding structure of the steel arm making the shot
nearly impossible as two more rounds ricochet off metal.

From directly above, the chopper chases Will down the crane
arm's length, firing.

(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:

WHAM -- the elevator door slams open and the Strike Team
rushes onto the platform, stopping short at the sight of:

WILL

running flat out toward the end of the arm, nothing but a
thousand foot drop and certain death at the end of it.

THE CROWD BELOW

inhales collectively as they watch this tiny figure race
toward the end of the plank...

WE'RE WITH WILL
as he runs those final few steps -- no hesitation, no
doubt -- to the end of the crane and then -- WHOOSH! -- he

LEAPS OFF OF IT, kicking high into the air like an Olympic
long jumper. Then...

-everything slows down-—
Silence. Wind rushes by our ears as we hang a hundred feet
above the fire in the pitch black of night
THE POLICE HELICOPTER

hovers almost directly above Will, fifty feet up; its rotors
turning in timeless slow motion -- WHOOSH-WHOOSH-WHOOSH.

Will begins to fall in a parabolic arc toward The Pearl --
toward the window pane with the sledgehammer embedded in it.

Aiming nearly straight down, the Sniper pulls the trigger.
CRACK!

The bullet races at Will who's falling toward the window pane
-- the HIGH VELOCITY ROUND RIPS INTO WILL'S LEFT SHOULDER.

 

Will cries out as the 7.62mm brass tears through flesh and

continues onward, piercing the EXTERIOR WINDOW -- shattering
it completely -- a split second before Will hits that very
same opening -- THUD!

Speed returns as Will slams into the newly-formed window
ledge, the impact knocking the wind from his lungs.

Glass rains down around him as the sledgehammer falls too --
its steel head hooking onto the window ledge.

(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED: (2)

Will falls back but, at the last second, he snatches the
sledgehammer handle, dangling there by his one good arm,
more than a hundred stories in the air.

The crowd below GASPS!

The sledgehammer starts to slide loose quickly. Will has no
choice but to use his other hand -- his injured arm.

He throws it up there, grabbing hold of the window's ledge
just as the sledgehammer dislodges, falling away.

Will hangs by his damaged arm. Enduring ungodly pain, he
manages to get his good arm on the ledge. Using both arms
now, Will pulls himself inside the building. He made it.

ON THE GROUND

the crowd goes WILD -- a folk hero is born.

INSIDE THE PEARL

No celebration. No quips. Exhausted, Will drags himself to
his feet and staggers off into the building.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BOARDROOM - NIGHT

In the boardroom, Zhao and the others watch in astonishment.

MR. PIERCE
What the hell's he doing?

ZHAO
Apparently, whatever it takes.

Dov enters and gives Zhao a look.

ZHAO (cont'd)
If you'll excuse me, please.

Zhao exits as Mr. Pierce and the suits watch the news
unfold.

INT. THE PEARL - ANTE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dov and Zhao step out of the boardroom, settling in.

(CONTINUED)
69.

CONTINUED:
DOV
McManus is instrument-rated, it's not
his day job, but he's more than
qualified to fly us out of here. I
sent him up to get the bird ready.
ZHAO
Excellent.
But Dov's face betrays him -- he's not saying something.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Is that it?

DOV
Sir, I've worked for you for nearly
eight years now. In that time, I
believe I've shown myself to be
trustworthy and more than capable...

ZHAO
What's on your mind, Dov?

DOV
Sir -- I can't protect you if you
don't tell me what's going on. This
isn't a fire, this is a plot -- and I

need some answers.

Zhao knows his body man is right.

ZHAO
I can't say for sure.

DOV
I don't need facts. What's your gut
telling you? Who's behind this?

That name hits Dov hard.

ZHAO
Wu-Sai Jun.

DOV
Triads?

ZHAO
Black Lotus.

DOV

I don't understand, if the Black
Lotus wanted you dead, there are
easier ways.

(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED: (2)

ZHAO
They don't want me dead -- they want
this.
Zhao pulls out the RED MEMORY CARD. Just then...

MR. PIERCE (0.S.)
Can we go?

Zhao quickly pockets the memory card. But Mr. Pierce clocks
it and senses that's he's interrupted a secret moment...

MR. PIERCE

Is there something I should know?
DOV

Yes -- the helicopter's ready.

Dov moves off, but Mr. Pierce isn't feeling too comfortable
about whatever it was he just witnessed.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Flanked by Dov and his security detail, Zhao, Mr. Pierce,
the suits approach the grand DOUBLE DOORS to his penthouse.
Zhao places a palm on a wall-mounted HAND-SCANNER.

The titanium double doors swing open. They exit.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE PRIVATE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Zhao and the posse move away from the penthouse's double and
step on to a PRIVATE ELEVATOR. The doors close. It goes up.

INT. THE PEARL - 110TH FLOOR - NIGHT

Bizarrely, Will finds himself on a floor filled with LUXURY
STORES -- a high-end shopping mall in the sky.

Bleeding on the imported Emperador marble floor, Will
staggers past CARTIER, GUCCI and TOM FORD -- all closed. He
spots an abandoned JANITOR'S CART up ahead. He rushes to it.

Will digs through the cart, looking for anything that might
help him. Quickly, he finds a roll of DUCT TAPE and a
bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL.

Will inspects his gunshot wound: a grisly quarter-sized hole

in the meat of his shoulder. Not good. He rips his shirt
sleeve off and rolls the fabric into a short tube.

(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:

Will unscrews the rubbing alcohol and dumps it onto his
wound -- the sudden pain hits him like a wave. Will braces
himself against the wall to keep from doubling over.

A breath, then Will thumbs the rolled fabric into his wound,
end-first. The pain is enormous, but the deed is done. The
wound has been packed. Will grabs the duct tape.

WILL
If you can't fix it with duct tape...

He winds it twice around the meat of his shoulder, tearing
the tape with his teeth, securing the ad hoc bandage snugly.

WILL (cont'd)
...then you aren't using enough duct
tape.

Will tests his arm. He can move it, but it hurts like a
bitch when he does. It'll have to do.

Will loops the duct tape to his belt and moves to the INNER
ATRIUM to get his bearings. All of the elevators are off-
line due to the fire. NEWS COVERAGE plays on an in-wall TV
SCREEN -- from the looks of it, the fire is about to reach
the park. Will talks to himself...

WILL (cont'd)
I'll find you. Just hang on.

Will moves to the STAIRWELL DOOR, throwing it open only to
stagger back as he's struck with a blast of heat and smoke.

Will tears his other sleeve off, tying the fabric around his
face. He gathers himself and enters the

STAIRWELL
which is choked black by smoke. Will spots a RED EMERGENCY
BOX with a WOODEN PICK-HEAD AX inside. A sharp elbow is all

it takes as Will grabs hold of a three-foot FIREMAN'S AX.
He descends into the smoke.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER

Zhao's LUXURY HELICOPTER sits inside this two-story, glass-
walled, hangar in the sky.

Then the GLASS WALLS slide apart like as the ENTIRE SECTION

of glossy showroom floor that the helicopter rests on
extends into the night sky like a plank on a pirate ship.

(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:

The rotors start to spin as the PILOT preps for take off.

Zhao and the others exit the elevator onto the hangar floor.

EXT. OFF-SITE CONTROL FACILITY - NIGHT

AN HKF ASSAULT TEAM moves through the open gate, clocking
the dead bodies in the guard shack.

They approach the low-slung concrete building, stacking up
by the door. The BREACHER uses his METAL RAM to knock the
doorknob straight through like a Whack-A-Mole -- THUNK!

The Team yanks the door open and rushes in tripping an
INFRARED BEAM and triggering the BLACK BRICK booby trap.

KA-BOOM. A bone-rattling explosion.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT
Chaos. Phones ring, people shout as word of the explosion
pours in. Captain Chan takes it all in with a grave calm.
Lieutenant Han approaches, handing him a print out.
LIEUTENANT HAN
Got positive ID on the JD in the
bathtub.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Who is he?

LIEUTENANT HAN

Sanjit Singh. Insurance executive

for Hawthorne/Stone, the company

underwriting The Pearl.
Chan puzzles over this new piece of information as we...

CUT TO:

PIERCE
standing in the penthouse hangar. He rolls up his
shirtsleeve, revealing a FAMILIAR LOOKING TATTOO. We're...
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE HANGAR - NIGHT
The helicopter's rotors at speed, the pilot signals for Zhao

and the others to approach. Zhao moves forward but Dov
stops him short -- something isn't right.

(CONTINUED)
73.

CONTINUED:
DOV
Hang on --
ZHAO
What is it?
DOV

-- The pilot. He's not ours.

SUDDENLY, PIERCE SNATCHES THE SIDEARM FROM THE BELT OF THE
NEAREST SECURITY GUARD -- YANKING IT FREE AND SHOOTING THE
MAN POINT BLANK.

 

Pierce turns to Zhao and pulls the trigger just as Dov
tackles his boss out of the way, catching a round.

The BAY DOORS on the helicopter are thrown open revealing
FIVE MEN in BLACK TACTICAL GEAR -- the very same suspicious
men we last saw on Sarah's floor, including the guy with the
Samurai topknot, now called FENG.

Instantly, it's a fire-fight. Pierce and his five men with
sub-machine guns versus Dov and his three men with handguns.

Caught in the crossfire, the suits are quickly dropped by
the assailants as Dov and his squad take cover.

Hunkered down with Zhao behind a METAL TOOL CHEST, Dov pops
up and clips a bad guy, causing him to fall off of the
HELIPAD PLANK, screaming as he heads all the way down.

Dov drops down, slapping in a fresh magazine.

DOV (cont'd)
When I tell you, run for the elevator.

Zhao nods. Dov pops up and jerks his aim toward
THE HELICOPTER

where he unloads eight shots through the windshield,
stitching the pilot in the chest. The pilot slumps forward
onto the controls CAUSING THE HELICOPTER TO LIFT AND TILT
TOWARD THE HANGAR -- it only takes a split second for the
blades to catch the helipad plank.

 

An unholy shriek of metal as the copter's body is whipsawed
toward the glass walls of the penthouse hangar.

DOV (cont'd)
Go!--

(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED: (2)

--BANG! Dov's voice is choked off as he's plugged in the
chest courtesy of Pierce. Shocked, Zhao takes off
running...

+..just as the 20-ton helicopter SMASHES THROUGH THE HANGAR
WINDOWS: an indoor crash-landing 220 stories above the earth.

Zhao reaches the elevator just as the chopper EXPLODES IN
FLAMES; shrapnel flies as Pierce and his men take cover.
EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

The crowd reacts to the explosion near the top of The Pearl.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - SAME

Chan and his team watch the explosion on their monitors.
Lieutenant Han holds out a phone...

LIEUTENANT HAN
Sir...

CAPTAIN CHAN
Not now.

LIEUTENANT HAN
It's the Chief Executive.

The air sucks out of the room. Captain Chan takes the
phone...

CAPTAIN CHAN
Good evening, your Honor.
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE HANGAR - NIGHT
Pierce spots Zhao disappearing in his private elevator. He
shouts at his men as he hurries toward the STAIRWELL DOOR,
slamming through it, racing to cut off Zhao's escape.
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator opens and Zhao bolts for his penthouse doors,
slapping his hand on the palm reader.

Click -- the heavy doors open just as Pierce barrels through
the adjacent stairwell door, gun blazing -- BANG-BANG-BANG!

(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:

Zhao slips through the narrow opening -- as Pierce's rounds
spark and ping off the doors. Zhao slams the EMERGENCY
CLOSE button. The titanium doors shut on Pierce's face,
locking him out.

BEHIND THE TITANIUM DOORS

Zhao breathes hard -- shaken. He reaches into his suit and
pulls out the RED MEMORY CARD, staring at it in relief.
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE ELEVATOR - SAME

Pierce curses his luck. His remaining five men arrive.
Furious, Pierce snatches a RADIO MIC off of one of them.

PIERCE
Open the penthouse doors!

EXT. STREET CAFE - NIGHT

Xia sitting at a street cafe a block from The Pearl touches
her ear. [INTERCUT AS NECESSARY]

XIA
Standby.

She opens Will's laptop, logging into The Pearl's control
systems. She selects the penthouse but can't affect it --
she's locked out of its controls. Not good.

XIA (cont'd)
The penthouse isn't linked to the
building's control system. He's got
his own subsystem for his floor. I
can't drive it -- I'm locked out.

Pierce fumes, then doubles down.
PIERCE
Kill the power to the upper half.
Cell tower too. All of it. Go dark.
With a few clever keystrokes Xia cuts the power to the top
half of The Pearl and disables its internal cell tower.

EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

The gathered crowd OOHS & AAHS as suddenly the top half of
The Pearl goes out like a Christmas Tree getting unplugged.
76.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE - SAME

Zhao's penthouse is thrown into darkness. Emergency lights
CHUNK ON. He pulls out his cellphone: no signal.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - SAME
Standing at the titanium doors, Pierce looks at his team...

FENG
How do we get in?

PIERCE
We can't. But I know someone who
can. And he happens to be in the
building.

FENG
The American? But we don't know
where he is.

PIERCE
We don't have to know where he is --
we know what he wants. All we need
to do is get to them first.

INT. THE PEARL - PANGU PARK - NIGHT
Sarah and the kids kneel by the stream in the park.

Georgia, still sporting a soiled Panda hoodie, re-wets their
towels in the ersatz lake. Henry coughs from smoke
inhalation -- an asthma attack taking hold.

SARAH
It's okay, baby. Just slow down.
Slow down and breathe. In for three,
out for three.

Sarah gives him two hits from the inhaler and helps Henry
calm his breathing, trying to get his attack under control.

The MUFFLED ROAR of the unchecked blaze GROWLS from below, a
leviathan rising. Sarah's worried.

SARAH (cont'd)
Okay, we gotta go.

GEORGIA
Why? There's water here.

(CONTINUED)
77.

CONTINUED:
SARAH
It's not safe.
HENRY
How do you know--
BOOM! -- a FIRE DOOR on the far end of the park rockets off

its hinges as flames reach through the new opening.

SARAH
Run!

Sarah hustles her kids through the park as from all angles
the fire begins to claw its way into the floor.

Fire breaks through the seams in the sod -- ZIG-ZAGGING
through the grass like snakes, chasing Sarah and the kids.

They rush for a STAIRWELL DOOR just as it EXPLODES LIKE A
PIPE BOMB. They duck as the door WHIZZES overhead shearing
through a METAL LAMPPOST behind them.

Sarah grabs her kids and yanks them in the other direction,
pushing them toward their only escape: THE INNER ATRIUM.

Henry struggles. Sarah picks him up, carrying her son, as
the trio rush across

THE SKY BRIDGE,

a narrow footbridge with a glass canopy that spans the
diameter of the INNER ATRIUM.

From above, we watch as Sarah and the kids race across the
sky bridge; the world below them filled with ash and fire,
glowing like the mouth of a volcano.
ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
they find respite -- this part of the park hasn't been
consumed by fire yet. Sarah puts Henry down, spotting
another STAIRWELL DOOR on the opposite wall. She's about to
make for it when, suddenly, it opens revealing FENG.
The guy doesn't miss a beat -- he smiles warmly...
FENG
Hey! We've been looking everywhere
for you guys.

Sarah exhales -- relieved. Then Feng speaks into his mic...

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED: (2)

FENG (cont'd)
Got 'em. They're in the park.

Something about his tone catches Sarah, she doesn't like it.

HENRY
Mom -- is that a fireman?

SARAH
I don't know, honey.
(calling out)
Who are you?

FENG
Building security. We met earlier,
remember?

Feng continues walking, closing the gap between them as
Sarah subtly moves in front of her children.

FENG (cont'd)
You need to come with us now -- the
building's not safe, we're evacuating.

Feng reaches for Sarah, she steps back.

SARAH
I want to see your ID.
FENG
Miss -- please. We don't have time.
SARAH
You work for the building -- ID.
Feng's jaw tightens.
FENG

Fine. You got it.
He reaches to his belt and pulls out his H&K COMBAT PISTOL.

FENG (cont'd)
Let's go, bitch.

Sarah's face falls. Feng grabs her, spinning her and
wrapping a big forearm around her neck.

FENG (cont'd)
Kids too.

Henry and Georgia start to tear up...

(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED: (3)

SARAH
It's okay -- it's okay, guys. Just
do what he says.

Surreptitiously, Sarah slides her hands into her front
pant's pocket, pulling out the pair of CHROME SCISSORS.

FENG
Listen to your mommy ki--AHHH!

Sarah stabs Feng in the upper thigh -- he cries out -- and
flips him over her shoulder in a slick judo move.

SARAH
Run!

Henry and Georgia take off running back across the sky
bridge, as Sarah dives for Feng's H&K, snatching it up and
turning back just in time to take a boot to the mouth.

Sarah goes sprawling as Feng rises, yanking the scissors
from his leg and tossing them aside. He picks up his pistol
but tucks it away and pulls out a TACTICAL KNIFE, spinning
it menacingly -- he's gonna do this old school.

Sarah gets to her feet, unarmed and out-muscled.

Easy prey in front of him, Feng attacks. But Sarah is more
than he bargained for as she side-steps his swing, blocking
his knife arm expertly before kicking his knee out.

Feng goes down hard, howling. Sarah turns and takes off
running back across the sky bridge.

IN THE PARK

Holding hands, Henry and Georgia find themselves in the
middle of a legitimate forest fire. In all the smoke and
madness, they get turned around quickly -- burning trees
everywhere.

Henry starts coughing harshly, letting go of his sister's
hand. And that's when a MASSIVE PIECE OF CEILING COLLAPSES.

Henry and Georgia dive out of the way just as the section
smashes between them through up smoke and fire.

Like a pilot in the fog, Henry gets turned around -- he
can't see Georgia any more. He calls out for her. Nothing.
Unsure, he picks a direction and heads that way, calling out
for his sister.

DOWN A WALK PATH

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED: (4)

Henry comes toward us, coughing madly and calling out for

Georgia. He doubles over at a PARK BENCH, trying to catch
his breath. He's alone and terrified. And that's when he
spots Sarah running across the bridge toward him.

HENRY
Mom!

Henry takes off running toward her.

ON THE SKY BRIDGE

Sarah races toward the far end when suddenly a BURNING TREE
from the park falls, crashing through the Inner Atrium glass

wall and SLICING THROUGH THE SKY BRIDGE IN ONE CLEAN STROKE.

A HAIL OF HOT EMBERS explodes as the END OF THE BRIDGE drops
at a sharp angle, nearly taking Sarah with it.

She turns back to see Feng hobbling toward her. He tucks
away his knife and pulls his H&K. No more games.

She's trapped. Sarah takes a step back, her heels dancing
on the edge of the broken bridge and a fall to her death.

FENG
I wasn't supposed to kill you -- but
I don't give a shit anymore.

He's about to pull the trigger when suddenly his face goes
slack. Then blood cascades down his chin and he face-plants
to reveal a FIREMAN'S AX in his back and

WILL

standing there, ten feet behind him, having hurled the
blade. Sarah rushes to him, they embrace.

WILL
Are you okay?
SARAH
I'm fine -- how did you get here?
WILL
Tell you later -- we gotta get the
kids.
SARAH

They're back in the park.

Will nods breaking into action -- he dislodges his ax and
goes to snag Feng's gun when...

(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED: (5)

BBBRAAAAT!

GUNFIRE rains down on the GLASS CANOPY of the sky bridge,
shattering it. Two of Pierce's MEN three floors up unload.

Will grabs Sarah's hand as they take off toward the open end
of the bridge through the maelstrom, exiting:

INTO THE FAR SIDE OF THE PARK

which has itself begun to burn. Will and Sarah hug the
curve of the INNER ATRIUM wall, circling around counter-
clockwise back toward the blocked end of the sky bridge...

HENRY
Mom! Dad!

There's Henry -- he was circling around clockwise toward
them. Will and Sarah kneel down, hugging their son.

SARAH
Where's Georgia?

HENRY
I don't know! We got split up --
she's back in the park somewhere.

Will and Sarah share a look -- they know how grave that is.
WILL
I'll find her. We gotta get you guys
outta here first -- they're coming

down for us.
SARAH
Will -- what the hell is going on?
Who are they?
WILL
I don't know yet. The only thing
that matters to me right now is
getting you out of here.
Will's eyes land on a nearby Inner Atrium Elevator.
WILL (cont'd)
Come on.

Lost and frightened, Georgia moves through the park.

82.
CONTINUED:

She calls out for her mother and brother but, with the roar
of the fire, her cries are quickly swallowed up.

She spots a GLASS STAIRCASE cut into the exterior window
wall of the building itself -- a tourist attraction feature.

BOOM! A FIERY SINKHOLE suddenly opens up in front of
Georgia, the ground beneath her feet eroding. She back
pedals from its lip and bolts for the glass staircase.

Just as she disappears, we land on the TWO GUNMEN we last
saw shooting at the skyway bridge. They spotted Georgia.

GUNMAN #1
(into mic)
We got the girl.

He nods to his buddy, they move for the stairs.

INT. THE PEARL - INNER ATRIUM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
Sarah and Henry are in the car, Will stands outside it.

SARAH
I'm not doing this--

WILL
Henry can't stay in this building --
there's too much smoke. You know
that. Whoever those guys are,
they're serious. The only safe place
for you both is on the ground.

Will finds a WALL PANEL and cleaves it open with his ax
revealing a complex array of cables and wiring. He digs
through the cabling as he talks...

WILL (cont'd)
These elevators are Mag-Lev -- they
work on electromagnetic induction.
But in the event of a power failure,
they're held in place by a hydraulic
fail-safe brake.

The power's out from the midpoint of
the building on up -- but it's still
on below the fire line. Once I cut
the hydraulic cable, you'll fall.

SARAH

SARAH
I'm not leaving you --

WILL

You're not leaving me, you're saving
Henry.

It's almost 1,000 feet from here to

handle -- okay?

SARAH
What about Georgia?

WILL
I'll find her. I promise.

It's a solemn vow. And Sarah knows it's the only way. She

kisses him.

I need you to be strong buddy -- take
care of Mom, okay? Can you do that

Will hugs his boy, kissing his forehead.

Step back.

They move back into the elevator, sitting down on the floor.
Will lines up his ax blade on a THICK YELLOW HYDRAULIC CABLE.

Will and Sarah lock eyes -- a look of love and strength
between them. Then Will steps into a home run swing --
THWACK!-- a clean cut.

Instantly the car plummets -- Sarah's SCREAM Dopplers away
as they disappear in a blink.

A descent into Hell itself. Seven...six...five...

-Two...ONE!

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

She yanks the handle. Nothing happens. They keep falling.
Sarah yanks the handle again -- then a loud CHUNKING noise
as she's slammed to the floor, a SHOWER OF SPARKS explodes
all around the car. Finally the carriage chokes to a stop.

Sarah looks at Henry -- the boy smiles. They made it.

INT. THE PEARL - 360 RESTAURANT - NIGHT

With its kitchen a concentric circle around the inner
atrium, this fancy-ass restaurant offers up stunning 360°
views of the Hong Kong skyline. The priciest meal in town.

What's more, the floor itself is comprised of GLASS PANELS,
offering up views of the park below. With the fire raging
unchecked, the setting is lit with an unearthly orange glow.

We find Georgia standing in the middle of the space,
breathing hard. Panic setting in. She hears a noise and
spins to see the two GUNMEN rushing up from the stairs.

Instinctively, Georgia ducks -- hiding a split second before
the men arrive on the scene.

The Gunmen scan the restaurant. They know she's here.
Gunman #1 motions to his partner, they split apart, stalking
through the Michelin-rated finery.

GUNMAN #1
It's okay -- we're the good guys.
You can come out now, you're safe.

GEORGIA,

hiding under a table, is anything but convinced. She spots
a STEAK KNIFE on the setting above her.

She sneaks her fingers up to snag it -- her hand
disappearing just as Gunman #2's eyes sweep that exact spot.

The Gunmen close in on her location, tossing over tables as
they go. Closer and closer to her hiding spot. Tension
squeezes us like a vice as Gunman #2 stops in front of
Georgia's table.

UNDER THE TABLE
Georgia dare not breathe. She clutches her steak knife and

spies Gunman #2's foot right in front of her. The young
girl screws up her courage and drives the knife home.

(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:

Gunman #2 ROARS. Georgia bolts from cover. Gunman #2
FIRES -- but his pained shots are wild, lighting up

glassware and cutlery all around Georgia as she dives behind
the CIRCULAR KITCHEN WALL against the inner atrium.

INT. THE PEARL - PANGU PARK - SAME

Will, searching feverishly in the fire, hears the gun shots
from above. He spots the glass staircase and breaks for it.

INT. THE PEARL - 360 RESTAURANT - SAME

Gunman #1 grabs Gunman #2's carbine, jerking it aside.

GUNMAN #1
We need her alive! She's the bait.
GUNMAN #2
She fuckin' stabbed me!
GUNMAN #1
Get over it.
He motions and the pair split up again -- each taking

opposite entry points into
THE CIRCULAR KITCHEN AREA

where Georgia crawls on all fours, staying low. She opens a
low STAINLESS STEEL CABINET and crawls inside, shutting it.

The hunters stalk their prey slowly, opening each cabinet as
they go -- it's only a matter of time.

In the small darkness, Georgia begins to cry, terrified.
Gunman #2 throws open Georgia's cabinet, revealing her.
GUNMAN #2
Found you, you little shit. You're

gonna pay for what you--

WHAM! Out of nowhere, Will freight trains him, sending
Gunman #2 smashing him against the inner atrium glass.

WILL
(to Georgia)
Go!

She does as Will turns his focus to Gunman #2 who fires at
point blank range.

(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:

But Will side-steps the shots, grabbing the muzzle and
stitching the atrium glass panel with them before kicking
Gunman #2 in the back, sending him through the panel and
down to the first floor the hard way.

Will pivots just as Gunman #1 opens fire on him. Will ducks
as pots and pans dance and pinwheel overhead.

Gunman #1 goes dry and reloads allowing Will to grab a CAST
IRON SKILLET and, using it like a medieval shield, charge.

Caught between reloads, Gunman #1 jerks his sidearm and
unloads into the iron plate, but Will is already on top of
him -- the beat down is merciless.

Will's about to end it when he hears...

PIERCE (0.S.)
Enough!

Will turns to see Pierce standing there, holding Georgia, a
pistol to her head. All the fight goes out of him.

For a moment, Will's confused -- the last time he saw Pierce
was in Zhao's penthouse boardroom. Quickly though, Will
puts together the double-cross. His eyes narrow. Then he
looks to his frightened daughter and reassures her...

WILL
It's gonna be okay, honey.

The Gangster gets to his feet and drives the stock of his
weapon viciously into Will's gut, dropping the big man to
his knees -- Will never takes his eyes off Georgia.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT

Captain Chan moves down the length of the trailer, heading
for the door, flanked by Lieutenant Han...

LIEUTENANT HAN
The Night Tigers are military --
counter-terror.

CAPTAIN CHAN
I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.

LIEUTENANT HAN
But this isn't an act of terrorism.

(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:

CAPTAIN CHAN
That's not how the his honor sees it.
He sees an expertly-trained foreign
national, wanted for murder, on the
loose inside that building preparing
to do god-knows-what. He's not going
to take any chances.

LIEUTENANT HAN
And you agree with him?

CAPTAIN CHAN
It doesn't matter if I agree with
him. It's happening.

Chan exits...

EXT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
...Lieutenant Han follows.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Captain...

CAPTAIN CHAN
There's nothing I can do. We've got
thirty minutes to resolve this
scenario or it becomes a military
operation and we're on the sideline.
So unless someone can tell me
something different is going on
inside of that building, they're
gonna use a broadsword on it.

Then:

OFFICER (0.S.)
Sir...

Chan turns to see: an OFFICER standing there with SARAH AND
HENRY, dirty, blanketed, but alive.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT

Pierce holds Georgia at gunpoint. The young girl whimpers
and shakes, tears rolling down her face, scared for her
life. Flanked by Pierce's three remaining men, Will is on

his knees, his hands zip-tied behind him.

Will does his best to console his daughter...

(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:

WILL
Honey -- look at me. Look at my
eyes. Everything's going to be
alright. I promise. You hear me?

Panicked, Georgia can only nod her head yes.

WILL (cont'd)
I love you, sweetheart.

GEORGIA
(shaking)
I love you too, Daddy.

PIERCE
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
interrupt.

Will glares. If a look could kill, Pierce would be toe-up.

WILL
The dead man in Horace's bathtub --
Singh -- that was you?

PIERCE
No -- that was your pal. That's the

nice thing about dealing with
degenerate gamblers, they'll do
anything to pay a debt. Even sell
out their dearest friend. Now -- you
still haven't answered my question.

WILL
I already told you: the only way that
door opens is if Zhao opens it from
his side or if this floor's fire
alarm triggers it -- but that can't
happen because you guys took the
entire system offline. You
understand? It can't be done.

PIERCE

Nonsense. Anything can be done with
the proper motivation. So let me
help. You're gonna get in there and
you're gonna bring Zhao, and what
he's holding, to me or I'm gonna
throw your daughter off the fucking
roof.

Pierce grabs Georgia's arm, shaking her sharply.

(CONTINUED)
90.
CONTINUED: (2)

PIERCE (cont'd)
I hear it's like heaven up there.

GEORGIA
Daddy!

Will lunges to his feet, charging at Pierce. One of Pierce's
MEN cracks him on the skull, sending him to the floor.

Will coughs and writhes, his eyes watering. Pierce shoves
Georgia to one of his men, then he moves over to Will,
kneeling down to cut his zip tied hands, smirking as he does.

PIERCE
Tick-tock...

Pierce grabs Georgia by the hair and yanks her toward the
STAIRWELL EXIT DOOR. The girl yells for her father -- Will
reaches out for Georgia from the ground, a futile gesture.

Pierce and his men disappear through the STAIRWELL EXIT.
His daughter's cries cut short as the door seals shut.

Will gets to his feet, shaking out the cobwebs. He moves to
the stairwell door, trying it with no luck -- it's locked.

He starts pacing, muttering to himself, his mind racing...

WILL
Come on, Will...think...think...

Will moves to an exterior-facing TWENTY-FOOT WIDE PANORAMIC
WINDOW, its CURTAINS drawn back like an elegant movie house
to reveal the skyline and fire raging five floors below.

He spots an in-wall FIRE ALARM BOX -- its digital display
flashes: OFFLINE. Will pulls the handle a couple times,
nothing. He's fucked.

Will tries to pry the Fire Alarm box off the wall, to get at
its innards, but without any luck. It's on there tight.

It's then that Will spots something on the other side of the
panoramic window...

WILL (cont'd)
Hello, beautiful.

Sitting directly opposite the fire alarm, on the exterior of

the building, is its CONTROL BOX resting there on the
exposed fascia. He spots a METAL TRASH CAN and picks it up.

(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED: (3)

Will slams the trash can against the panoramic window --
CLANG! Nothing. A chip maybe. Will tries again, no luck.

WILL (cont'd)
Damn it.

Will moves down the PANORAMIC WINDOW, away from the FIRE
ALARM until he comes to the window's end.

He stops at an ADJACENT PANEL OF GLASS, just as tall but
only about four-feet wide -- an easier target.

Will presses on it with his hand, judging its thickness.
Knowing now what it takes now, Will backs up and then
charges: using the trash can like a battering ram -- WHAM!

INSTANTLY THE WHOLE SECTION SHATTERS INTO A MILLION PIECES
and Will's momentum carries him THROUGH THE OPENING!

 

He lets go of the trash can, barely managing to grab hold of
the WINDOW TRANSOM to keep from falling through completely.

Will gathers himself and scans the penthouse level. His
eyes land on a BRONZE STATUE of a CHINESE WARRIOR resting on
a four-foot MARBLE PEDESTAL.

He shoulders the pedestal sending the statue crashing. The
Warrior's HAND breaks free and in it a SIX-INCH SHORT-SWORD
("Dao"). Will picks up the thin blade -- it'll do.

He looks at the CURTAINS hanging to one side of the
panoramic window. He yanks them down, quickly finding the
BRAIDED CORD that the mechanism uses to retract them. Will
loops the cord around his elbow like a length of rope.

Finished, Will knows he's still missing one more thing. He
reaches for his belt and holds up the DUCT TAPE.

CUT TO:
WILL'S HANDS
wrapped like a boxer's before a bout but with duct tape,
STICKY SIDE OUT. Will finishes the last strip and tests his
new hand adhesion by placing his palms together.

CUT TO:
THE MARBLE PEDESTAL
lying on its side at the foot of the shattered window panel.

One end of the curtain rope is tied around its the pedestal,
the other end Will lashes around his waist, knotting it.

(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED: (4)

We see that Will has also duct taped his feet. He checks
the stickiness of one, talking to himself...

WILL (cont'd)
Can never be too careful when you're
doing something this stupid.

Standing at the open window, the wind howling madly, nothing
but a three-thousand foot fall and certain death below him,
Will steadies himself...

WILL (cont'd)
Kids, don't try this at home...

...and then he steps out, pivoting around the window
transom. But his first step is a poorly place one and Will
stumbles, nearly falling.

HE CLUTCHES THE TRANSOM AND PULLS HIMSELF BACK IN -- his
life flashing before his eyes. Will lets out a little
laugh -- nerves getting the better of him. Two steadying
breaths and Will gives it another go.

He pivots out stepping onto the SIX-INCH LEDGE that runs
along the base of the panoramic window. Will presses his
body as close as he can to the glass -- his duct taped hands
sticking nicely to the window.

Slide step by slide step, Will crosses the twenty-foot wide
section of glass, eyeing the CONTROL BOX on the far side.

Below him, the fire rages -- climbing ever-closer.

INT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - NIGHT

Being tended to by an EMT, Henry breaths through an oxygen
mask as nearby Sarah sketches something for Chan.

SARAH
It looked like this...

Sarah flips around a clipboard to reveal a crude facsimile
of the Black Lotus Triad tattoo. Chan and Han share a
knowing look.

CAPTAIN CHAN
And how many of them did you say you
saw?

SARAH
Six.

(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:

CAPTAIN CHAN
Do you have any idea what they're
doing up there? Why they're doing
this?

SARAH
No.

LIEUTENANT HAN
And you claim your husband isn't
involved?

SARAH
I don't claim that -- I'm telling you
that. He's not involved.

Lieutenant Han pulls his boss away for an aside, speaking in
Cantonese.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Captain -- this doesn't pass the
smell test. None of it does. If the
Black Lotus are there to get
something -- to steal something --
why light the building on fire? And
if they're trying to cover their
tracks -- fine -- but why trap
yourself above the fire line and then
destroy your only means of escape?
It doesn't make any sense.

A sudden realization hits Sarah. She cuts in in Cantonese,
surprising the officers.

SARAH
That's not their only means of escape.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Really? Then how are they planning
to get out?

SARAH
They're gonna jump.

LIEUTENANT HAN
Excuse me?

SARAH
They're gonna jump off the top. When I
saw them that first time, they had
containers with them marked in Russian.

(CONTINUED)
94.

Sarah grabs a computer terminal. Types in the word for
PARACHUTE then hits translate to Russian.

TIAPAMOT
Pops up. She points at it.

SARAH (cont'd)
That's the word I saw on the
container they had.

Sarah moves to a WALL MAP of HONG KONG, scanning it.

SARAH (cont'd)
(to Han)
Gimme your pen.

The lieutenant hesitates, looking to Chan for the okay.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Give her your pen...

He obliges and Sarah snags it, checking its length against
the map's scale legend. She marks an X on the map.

SARAH
The Pearl is here.
(beat)
A base jump from a thousand meters up
gives you about triple that in
lateral descent distance -- call ita
mile to be safe, two pen lengths.

LIEUTENANT HAN
How do you know that?

She turns her phone's screen to them and shrugs...

SARAH
I Googled it.

The Captain shoots his Lieutenant a look: she got you there.

Sarah measures out two pen lengths from the X in all four
directions, then connects the points with a crude circle.

SARAH (cont'd)
That's your search area. If they
land, they'll land within that
circle -- and if they have friends,
they'll be waiting to pick them up at
the landing zone. Someplace flat and
open.

(CONTINUED)
95.

CONTINUED: (3)

Impressed, Captain Chan moves closer to the map...

Sarah points

CAPTAIN CHAN

And secluded.

(scanning the map)
They won't go for Victoria Park --
too obvious and too many trees to get
hung up on. South, but you'd never
clear the peak. West, maybe, but
it's a longer haul to an open spot.
Risky.

SARAH
There. What's that -- on the other
side of the harbor? The Kowloon side.

to a BROWN RECTANGLE in the water.
LIEUTENANT HAN

That's nothing. It's a construction
sand barge -- bay dredge.

Sarah gives Chan a look. He's thinking.

LIEUTENANT HAN (cont'd)
Captain, you can't seriously be
considering this. For all we know,
she's in on it.

SARAH
You think I'd willingly trap my own
children in a burning building?

LIEUTENANT HAN
I think you could be playing a role.
You could be a distraction to allow
your husband to escape. This could
all be part of his plan.

Sarah can't believe this guy. She turns to Chan...

SARAH

Captain, I know you wanna get this
right and the last thing you want to do
is to point your gun at the wrong guy.

(beat)
Take me out to the sand barge. If
it's empty and I'm wrong, what have
you lost? But if I'm right, it might
be your only chance to catch the men
responsible for this whole thing.

(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED: (4)

Captain Chan considers this. He's about to respond when
suddenly there's a RUMBLING FROM THE CROWD OUTSIDE.

Something's going on. Chan breaks for the trailer's exit
door, followed by Lieutenant Han and Sarah.
EXT. EMERGENCY OPS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

The trio come to a stop just outside the trailer. They
stare at the HD BILLBOARD, stunned.

ON SCREEN, we see long-lens news footage of Will inching
across the PANORAMIC WINDOW, nearly a mile above them.

They turn from the giant video screen and look up with their
own eyes to see Will's ant-like form, clinging to the side of
the building -- an insane act. The act of a desperate man.

SARAH
Captain, does that look like someone
with a plan to you?

Chan glances at Sarah -- his wheels turning.

EXT. THE PEARL - PANORAMIC WINDOW - NIGHT

220 stories above the earth, Will presses himself against
the glass, inches from his goal. One more step.

Will makes the step --BOOM!-- a glass panel on the floor
below him explodes like a car bomb.

Will lunges for the control box, clutching it to keep from
falling. Two more explosions rock the tower from below.

Will finds footing around the box. He reaches into his
waistband and pulls out the statue's sword, wedging it into
the seams of the box, prying at it.

With a crack, it pops open and Will goes to work on the
wiring. He finds what he's looking for -- a GOLD WIRE.

Using the statue sword, Will strips the wire, cuts another
one, and hot-wires them together. A GREEN LIGHT on the
conduit panel turns off and a RED LIGHT starts FLASHING.
THE FIRE ALARM BOX

on the other side of the panoramic window flashes the words:
FIRE-FIRE-FIRE.
97.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - SAME

The CONTROL PANEL next to the PENTHOUSE DOORS flashes the
same: FIRE-FIRE-FIRE. With a heavy metal CHUNK, the
TITANIUM DOORS UNLOCK AND SLOWLY START TO SWING OPEN.

 

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - SAME

The panel by Zhao's bed blinks: FIRE-FIRE-FIRE. Zhao pulls
open his nightstand drawer snatches up a PALM-SIZED BERETTA
NANO -- an executive's gun meant to be concealed. Zhao
exits.

INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Zhao rounds the corner to see the front doors to his
penthouse wide open. He moves to the nearest control panel
and tries to shut the doors, but the programming won't allow
it -- the fire alarm overrides his controls.

Thinking fast, Zhao pulls his smartphone out of his pocket,
snags a nearby USB cable and plugs his phone directly into
the panel itself. He starts thumbing away like mad.

EXT. THE PEARL - PANORAMIC WINDOW - NIGHT

Will lets go of the control box and begins to make his way
back across the panoramic window, slide step by sli -- BOOM!

A DEAFENING EXPLOSION rattles the world.
Will falls.

Everything goes topsy-turvy as we plummet. Suddenly, we're
jerked to stop as Will's securing rope snaps taught.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that the sudden force of the fall has caused
Will's securing rope to slip down his body -- coming to a
snug cinch point around the ankle of Will's prosthetic leg.

Fire raging around him, Will dangles upside down by his
ankle, a mile up, like a rabbit caught in a rope snare.

THE MARBLE PEDESTAL
is yanked against the window frame at a poor angle, wedging

itself against the transom in anything but a secure fashion.

(CONTINUED)
98.

CONTINUED:

Swinging upside down, Will gets his bearings. He tries to
curl his body up toward the rope -- like a hanging sit-up --
but the added strain of the move causes his prosthetic
sleeve to loosen -- WILL'S LEG IS SLIPPING OUT OF IT.

Will falls back, dangling by a leg that's coming loose.
Like a car teetering on the edge of a cliff, any movement
from Will might cause his leg to come undone completely.

The earth a postage stamp below him, Will steadies himself,
becoming as still as possible, barely daring to breathe.

Will knows he's going to have one shot at this. He gathers
his courage and makes one sharp move.

With a grunt, he breaks into action using his free leg to
kick off the face of the building while throwing his hands
toward his toes, propelling himself upward with such force
that his RESIDUAL LIMB POPS OUT OF THE PROSTHESIS.

 

For a blink, Will is in complete free fall -- no rope, no
leg -- but his hands snag hold of the CARBON FIBER FEMUR at
the last possible second.

A strange sight indeed: a one-legged man, clinging to a
metal leg, attached to a rope, 3,000 feet in the air.

Will starts pulling with everything he's got. A dead-hang
rope climb. The weight of this undulating action causes

THE MARBLE PEDESTAL

to strain against the window transom, inching closer and
closer to dislodging completely.

WILL

free-climbs for all he's worth, hand-over-hand, a man of
undying determination: his arms burning, but his eyes
focused on the open window ledge ten feet above him.
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT

At the control panel for the doors, Zhao has used his
smartphone to hack bypass the fire alarm function and he

instructs the doors to reset.

Zhao jabs the "SECURE DOORS" button the panel and watches as
the titanium Goliaths lurch toward each other.

Zhao takes cover behind a LOW CABINET, checking his mini-
Beretta, ready to plug anyone who comes through the door.
99.

EXT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE FLOOR - NIGHT

Will's forearm slaps over the marble pedestal. He pulls
himself up and over the final hurdle.

Exhausted, Will collapses. But only for a moment as he
suddenly sees the penthouse doors closing -- he's only got
seconds before they shut again, sealing him out for good.

Leaping into action, Will starts pulling up the rope, his
prosthesis dangling on the other end like fish on a hook.

Just then, another explosion from below rocks the penthouse
floor causing the marble pedestal to break free and plummet
through the window like an anchor.

The cord rips through Will's duct-taped hands, smoking them
as Will's prosthesis whips back to him like a boomerang.

Will clutches his leg as it's being pulled from his grip by
the four-hundred pound pedestal on other end of the rope.

Will glances back at the penthouse doors -- they're almost
closed now: he's gotta make a choice his leg or the door.

But Will makes a third play: he pulls the statue's sword
from his waistband and cuts the rope with one downward hack.
The rope whips through the window opening as Will tumbles
back, his prosthetic leg in his hand.

Will jams his leg into the PROSTHETIC SLEEVE and spins to
see the penthouse doors a foot from sealing shut.

Will bolts for them, diving into a head-first slide on his
side -- like a car up on two wheels -- and narrowly SKIMS
THROUGH THE OPENING. He made it.

Only, he didn't.

Will's PROSTHETIC ANKLE is caught in the door like a bear
trap. Will tugs on it with both hands, it won't budge.

With one final pull, Will yanks his leg through the doors,
which quickly seal shut behind him, tumbling back into a
heap on the foyer. Then:

ZHAO (0.S.)
Don't move.

Will looks up to see Zhao pointing his tiny Beretta a foot
from Will's nose. Will's shoulders slump at his luck.

(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:

WILL
You're too close.

What an odd thing to say. Zhao doesn't follow...

ZHAO
What?

WILL
You're...

WHACK!

With cat-like quickness, Will slaps the Beretta out of the

inexperienced billionaire's hands as he yanks Zhao's wrist

downward and simultaneously sweeps his leg, dropping him to
the polished floor -- a slick-ass take down.

WILL (cont'd)
...too close.

Will pounces on him, driving the point of his good knee
between Zhao's shoulder-blades, pinning him there.

WILL (cont'd)
We need to talk.

CUT TO:
A SMALL MAN IN A SHARP SUIT.
Tan, salt & pepper hair. Bushy eyebrows. Capped teeth. A
Chinese Martin Scorsese. This is WU-SAI JUN, kingpin and

crime lord of Hong Kong. He smiles at us.

WU-SAI JUN
I know this is difficult.

We're...

INT. GANGSTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Opulent, dark. The den of a powerful man. Zhao sits opposite
Jun. Xia sprawls on a nearby chaise as Feng looms in view.

Behind Jun, the most striking feature: a wall comprised of
GLASS TERRARIUMS, each containing a solitary SNAKE.

WU-SAI JUN
For a man like you, this must come
with some discomfort.

(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
But you can take solace in the fact
that it's all for a greater good.
The glory of The Middle Kingdom.

ZHAO
Forgive me, but I don't see how
extortion glorifies China.

WU-SAI JUN
This isn't extortion, Mr. Zhao, this
is business.

ZHAO
And if I refuse?

Wu-Sai Jun smiles. This man might take more convincing. He
rises from this seat moving toward the back wall of snakes.

WU-SAI JUN
There are ten snakes in the world to
which there exists no known antivenom.
(re: the terrarium wall)
I've made a home here for each one.

Jun slides out one particular terrarium from the wall like a
drawer in a bureau. The BLACK & BLUE STRIPED SNAKE inside
it coils, ready to strike.

WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
The snake handlers of Burma practice
an ancient art called Mithridatism.

He opens the top of glass box. The snake hisses, a warning.

WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)

They believed that by ingesting small
amounts of a snake's poison over
time, they would become one with the
animal, rendering its venom harmless.

Jun rolls up his sleeve, revealing his BLACK LOTUS TRIAD
TATTOO. He places his arm in the terrarium, holding it
there in front of the hissing reptile but never taking his
eyes from Zhao.

WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)

The Blue Krait's venom has been used
for centuries by indigenous Malaysian
tribes to hunt big game. It's said a
single bite can stop an elephant's
heart in under ninety seconds.

(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED: (2)

Suddenly Jun throws his fingers out, splaying them in a
sharp motion that causes the snake to strike -- biting Jun
on his forearm, just under his tattoo.

The gangster winces but doesn't waver -- watching Zhao the
entire time.

The snake recoils. Jun lifts his arm out of the terrarium
and observes two trickles of blood running down his forearm.
Pointedly, he licks the blood from his arm and then, gentile
as you please, rolls his shirt sleeve back, buttoning it.

WU-SAI JUN (cont'd)
I know this arrangement may seem
poisonous to you now but, over time,
once you've completed your building, I
promise you: you won't feel a thing.
Zhao looks pained. A moment, then...

ZHAO
Give me the account number.

Jun nods to Xia. She slides over a piece of paper with a
lengthy number on it. Zhao takes it and enters the info
into his phone. By the looks of things, he's transferring
$50 million from his account into a different one.

He hits transfer. His phone chimes: complete.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Are we done?

Jun gives us a reptilian smile.

WU-SAI JUN
Good luck with construction.

Zhao stands, straightens his jacket and exits.
WILL (PRE-LAP)
You paid them off?
INT. THE PEARL - PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Zhao sits on a couch as Will looms above him.
ZHAO
If I didn't, they would've crippled

that amount in construction delays.

CONTINUED:

WILL
So you caved. But if he got what he
wanted, why's he doing all this?

ZHAO

I didn't cave. I could never let The
Pearl become corrupted by the likes
of Wu-Sai Jun.

(beat)
As soon as he accepted my payment, he
chopped it up, dispersing it to all
of his other off-shore accounts in
smaller increments.

WILL
He laundered it.

ZHAO
Essentially, yes. But what he didn't
know is that I hid a Trojan Horse in
my wire transfer -- a digital dye
pack that infected every account any
portion of my payment touched,
feeding the routing and account
information back to me.

Zhao holds up the RED MEMORY CARD.

ZHAO (cont'd)

This card contains the account
information for every single dollar
Wu-Sai Jun and the Black Lotus Triads
have. Over half a billion dollars in
illicit monies in thirty-six separate
holding banks around the globe.

(beat)
I hand this over to the Chinese
government and they can freeze all of
his assets -- destroying his entire
operation and sending him to prison
for the rest of his life.

WILL
Then why didn't you turn it over to
the authorities? Be done with it.

ZHAO
If I did that, Wu-Sai Jun would have
no reason not to kill me. I'd be
signing my own death warrant.
(beat)

As long as I hold onto this, we have
detente. They had to leave me alone
and let me build The Pearl without

interference.

WILL
But how does getting that particular
card help them -- you must've made
copies.

ZHAO

I did, of course. But this is the
original. With it, they can reverse
engineer my Trojan Horse payment and
scrub their accounts clean again --
no digital dye, no way for the
authorities to trace the money and
find their secret accounts. If they
get their hands on this, all of my
other copies would be worthless.
(beat)
Besides, their plan isn't to let me
live. Their plan is to get their
hands on this and the moment they do,
I'm a dead man.

Will paces, putting it all together now...

Will stands.

WILL
So they lit the building on fire
because they knew you'd grab the most
valuable thing in the world to you
and flee -- just like anyone would.

ZHAO
No one could get it out of my safe
except for me. They just needed to
give me a good reason.

We're gonna give them what they came

ZHAO
Didn't you hear me? As soon as they

WILL
Maybe. But they have my daughter and
that's all that matters to me.

ZHAO
I'm not eager to die.

In ten minutes this entire floor is

EXT. THE PEARL - NIGHT

The tallest building in the world burns. In epic grand
finale fashion, we circle the building landing on:

THE GLASS OBSERVATION DECK

The light from the flames below dance off of its facets,
making it sparkle against the skyline like a black diamond.

INT. THE PEARL - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

Pierce and his THREE MEN wait inside the CANOPIED GLASS,
each strapped into a sleek, low-profile, PARACHUTE PACKS.

(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:

Georgia, her Panda hoodie dirt-stained, sits on the ground,
eyes red from crying. Suddenly, she sees something...

GEORGIA
Daddy!

Pierce and his men turn to see Will pushing Zhao forward
like a prisoner, his wrists duct taped together in front of
him.

Pierce grabs Georgia roughly, yanking the girl to her feet as
his men fan out. Will and Zhao stop twenty feet from them.

PIERCE
See? I knew you'd find a way.

Pierce nods at his biggest guy.

PIERCE (cont'd)
Check 'em.

The BIG MAN moves to Will and starts patting him down. He
gets to Will's leg -- feels something funny. Will pulls up
his pant-leg to reveal his metal prosthesis.

Will shrugs. The Big Man moves on to Zhao, patting him down
as the billionaire lifts his duct-taped hands above his head.

BIG MAN
They're clean.

The Big Man returns to his post. Pierce nods his approval.

PIERCE
Smart.

Will holds up the RED MEMORY CARD.

WILL
Here it is. Now let her go.

PIERCE
Go to your daddy, sweetheart.

Georgia starts for Will, but Pierce stops her short --
grabbing her by the hoodie, toying with Will.

PIERCE (cont'd)

You know -- on second thought -- I'd
like to have that memory card first.

(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED: (2)

Will's about to toss it to him when suddenly ZHAO LIFTS HIS
DUCT TAPED WRISTS, REVEALING THAT HE'S BEEN PALMING HIS
BERETTA NANO -- hiding it beneath the silvery tape.

ZHAO
I can't let you do it.

Will blanches. Zhao has double crossed him. Pierce and his
men lift their weapons as Zhao snatches the memory card out
of Will's hand and steps behind him for cover.

WILL
What the hell are you doing? This
isn't the plan.

ZHAO

The plan's changed.
(to Pierce)

I want a parachute.

Pierce grabs Georgia, jamming his gun against her cheek.
ZHAO (cont'd)
I don't care about the girl -- a
parachute or your boss gets nothing.

Will's jaw sets -- the tension high. Pierce calculates the
angles, then turns to his BALD GOON.

PIERCE
Give him your parachute.
BALD GOON
Huh?
PIERCE

Give him your fucking parachute.
Pierce points his weapon at his subordinate. The Bald Goon
hesitates, then pops the chest buckle on his chute and slips
it off, holding it out.

ZHAO
Bring it here.

The Bald Goon checks with Pierce who nods: do it. Baldy
moves closer, too close now.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Stop. Drop it there.

The Goon does as he's bid.

(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED: (3)

ZHAO (cont'd)
Step back.

Zhao holds up the red memory card.

ZHAO (cont'd)
Here's your card.

With that, Zhao suddenly flings the memory card away like a
mini-Frisbee. Instinctively, everyone turns to watch it go.

But not Will -- he looks at his daughter and yells:

WILL
Run!

And she does. Georgia bolts as Zhao opens fire. Will
reaches into the SIDE POCKET of his right pant leg, taking
hold of something and PULLING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO REVEAL:

THE CHINESE SWORD WHICH HE'D DUCT TAPED TO HIS METAL LEG.

It shears through Will's pant leg with ease and he now holds
a three-foot razor-sharp blade in his hands. In a flash,
Will lunges, driving it through the Bald Goon's sternum as
Pierce and his men OPEN FIRE!

The entire observation deck erupts into a gunfight as
everyone moves to what cover they can find.

It's a gunfight in a glass house -- panels shatter, raining
down shards left and right, each new opening ushering in a

howling rush of wind like an airplane emergency door being

thrown open at 40,000 feet.

What's more -- with the firelight from below, the entire
space takes on the eerie effect of a house of mirrors.
Reflections dance in double and triple exposure as this
life-and-death finale unfolds in triplicate before us.

Amidst this maelstrom of glass and wind and gunfire we find:
WILL

wedged up behind some cover, his sword at the ready. Out of
the corner of his eye he spots the REFLECTION OF GEORGIA
tucked into a ball covering her ears. He has to get to her.
Just then, Will sees the BIG MAN rushing toward him. Will
throws this sword -- it strikes the Big Man in the chest

but, strangely, the Big Man doesn't react -- instead he
SHATTERS into a thousand pieces: a reflection.

(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED: (4)

Which means: THE BIG MAN IS BEHIND WILL.

Will spins just in time to knock the muzzle of the Big Man's
sub-machine gun aside at it looses a rip of automatic fire.

In a blink, the two are in a close-quarters grapple to the
death. Will quickly gains the upper-hand.

The Big Man sees the tables turning against him and drives
his thumb into Will's shoulder wound. Will cries out as the
Big Man headbutts him, dropping Will to the deck in a daze.

The Big Man pounces, wrapping his meaty forearms around
Will's neck, putting him in a deadly sleeper-hold.

Will's seconds away from blacking out. He reaches for the
sword -- lying on the rooftop just out of his reach.

The Big Man jerks Will away from it, placing himself between
Will and the sword, his back to the SHATTERED GLASS PANEL.

BIG MAN
Nighty-night...

ZHAO

trading shots with Pierce. Zhao ducks back down, reloading.
Pierce pulls a GRENADE and tosses it at Zhao.

The grenade lands perfectly. Zhao sees it and dives from
cover as it explodes, exposing him to Pierce's gun-sites.

Pierce unloads, clipping Zhao in the leg as the magnate
scrambles for safety.

BACK TO:
WILL

being choked out. His fingers stumble numbly over the Big
Man's face. The Big Man almost smiles -- it's over.

And that's when Will grabs hold of the PARACHUTE'S RELEASE
HANDLE. With his last remaining strength, Will pulls it.

The Big Man's parachute ejects from his back -- quickly
catching the rushing wind and yanking him through the broken
glass panel like he was shot out of a cannon -- WHOOM!

The Big Man's scream is cut short when his head catches the
window transom on the way out -- offering up a meaty THUNK.

(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED: (5)

Will scans the rooftop for Georgia. But instead, he spots
THE RED MEMORY CARD
lying on the ground out in the open.

Will rushes for it, snatching it up and turning to break back
for cover when he comes face-to-face with the FINAL GOON.

No words -- the Goon fires at point blank range: BANG!
But the Goon's gun doesn't go off. His torso jerks in three
successive spasms, as he's punched through by three shots,
falling to reveal Zhao, clutching his gunshot leg.
WILL
You're a pretty good actor for a
billionaire.

ZHAO
How do you think I got to be one?

Clearly, Zhao's "double-cross" was part of the plan. Will
holds up the memory card...

WILL
Found something for you.

ZHAO
Great. Now let's get your daugh--

THE AREA ERUPTS INTO SPARKS

as Pierce has flanked them, unloading his sub-machine gun on
them. Pierce goes dry -- he curses his luck, ducking down.

Zhao pitches forward onto Will who pulls him down to safety

BEHIND COVER.

Will checks Zhao's wounds -- he's been gut-shot badly.
Blood pours from his mouth. Not good.
WILL
Hang on -- stay with me.
Zhao shoves his gun into Will's hands -- the first time he's

touched one in ten years. Zhao looks him in the eye.

ZHAO
Find her.

WILL
I'm coming back for you.

Will nods and moves off.
CUT TO:
WILL

moving through the observation deck, stalking -- looking for
Georgia, a hair trigger ready for Pierce. Then...

GEORGIA (0.S.)
Daddy!

Will spins to see Pierce holding his daughter out on

THE EXTENDED DECK.

The same place Will stood when he first came up here.
Nothing below their feet but a thin piece of glass and a
three-thousand foot fall.

Pierce holds a grenade in one hand and Georgia against his
body -- making a crack shot difficult.

The tableau is a haunting mirror of the farmhouse standoff
that cost Will so dearly. Will is struck cold.

PIERCE
You shoot me, I drop this, she dies.
Disarm.
A pained moment. With no choice, Will obliges -- crouching

down to place his gun on the deck. But...
At the last moment, Will fires!

But he doesn't fire at Pierce -- HE FIRES AT THE GLASS PANEL
BENEATH HIS FEET. The entire floor panel SHATTERS -- PIERCE
AND GEORGIA FALL STRAIGHT THROUGH IT.

Will leaps for the opening -- diving through the hole,
reaching out with everything's he's got and, at the last
possible second, he catches hold of GEORGIA'S HOODIE.

Surprise and horror on his face, Pierce falls away from
us -- the GRENADE EXPLODES next him, obliterating the
villain in mid-air. A grisly demise.

Will yanks his daughter back through the opening -- narrowly

avoiding the blast -- and up to the rooftop. She collapses
on his chest. Safe.

(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED: (7)

Will holds his daughter tight. She clings to him, shaking.

GEORGIA
Daddy, I wanna go home.

Will kisses the top of her head and exhales.

WILL
Me too, honey.

EXT. SAND BARGE - NIGHT

The sand barge is little more than a dirt square, made from
the dredge of the surrounding bay, dotted with RUSTED OUT
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT. A forgotten place.

Surrounded by three black SUVS and a dozen ARMED MEN, Wu-Sai
Jun glasses the top of The Pearl with binoculars. Xia
strides up.

XIA
He's not answering.
(beat)
He should've been here already.

Wu-Sai Jun doesn't like it. His gangster's intuition
ringing alarm bells in his mind.

WU-SAI JUN
We're leaving.

He moves for the SUVs when suddenly he sees a pair of
HEADLIGHTS racing down the ACCESS ROAD toward them. The
headlights split, revealing themselves to be SIX PAIRS, not
one -- Hong Kong PD.

IN THE LEAD CAR

Captain Chan rides shotgun, Lieutenant Han at the wheel.
Sarah, vested up, is in the back.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Get down and stay down. Do not leave
the car. Understand?
Sarah obliges, scooching down low.

WU-SAI JUN

screams at his men to open fire -- and they do: unloading on
the approaching cops with peels of automatic gunfire.

(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:

The cops broadside their cars and hop out behind cover,
trading shots with the gangsters.

The handwriting is on the wall as Chan drops two gangsters
with crack shots -- they've got the bad guys outnumbered.

Jun squats behind a wheel-well, blindly firing.

Xia fires expertly, clipping a pair of cops -- but she sees
the situation is hopeless.

One by one, the gangsters drop their weapons and surrender.
Wu-Sai Jun as well. The cops rush forward to take the bad
guys into custody as Xia sneaks off into the darkness.

XIA

slinks through the junkyard, looking for an escape. She
spots CAPTAIN CHAN'S CAR unmanned and idling thirty meters
away, apart from the round-up taking place by the SUVs.
This is her shot -- she hurries

INTO THE CAR

hopping into the driver's seat and reaching for the gear
shift when:

SARAH (0.S.)
Hey.
Xia looks back just in time to catch the heel of Sarah's
boot on the point of her chin -- CRACK! The crisp violence
of the kick knocks Xia out cold.

The lady killer slumps like a rag-doll onto the steering
wheel -- the horn blares.

A beat later, Chan throws open the passenger door to see the
result. He looks back at Sarah sitting there. She puts her
hands up innocently...

SARAH
I never left the car.

Chan exhales, relieved. That's when Sarah spots something
slipping out of Xia's bag...

SARAH (cont'd)
That's Will's laptop.

Chan and Sarah share a look. She grabs it, opening it up.

(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED: (2)

CAPTAIN CHAN
What are you doing?

SARAH
Trying to get The Pearl's fire system
back online.

Sarah noses through the building control app, trying to get
a sense of things.

CAPTAIN CHAN
Do you know how to do that?

SARAH
Not remotely.

CAPTAIN CHAN
But you're good with computers?

SARAH
Terrible. But the control program is
still open and it seems pretty
straightforward...

CAPTAIN CHAN
How 'bout we get that to someone who
knows what they're doing.

SARAH
Captain, my husband and daughter are
in that building and it's on fire
right now. I'm not waiting another
god damn second. So you can either
arrest me or --

DING! The computer chimes. Sarah spins it to face Chan,
showing The Pearl ENTIRELY GREEN from top to bottom with a
flashing indicator: SYSTEMS ONLINE.

SARAH (cont'd)
-- you can say thank you.

Sarah smiles, Captain Chan shakes his head at her moxie.

EXT. THE PEARL - OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

The entire observation deck blazes like a house on fire.
Will places Georgia next to an injured and weak Zhao.

WILL
Stay here. I'll be right back.

(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:

GEORGIA
No! Don't go!

WILL
I'll be right back, I promise.

Will squeezes his daughter and moves off through the smoke
and fire searching for

THE PARACHUTE

which he spots resting on the deck, surrounded by fire.
Will's about to make a move for it when suddenly there's
EXPLOSION from a NEARBY COOLANT TANK.

Will shields his eyes, turning back to see the parachute
burning, melted and disfigured and smoking -- useless.

The turn of events is gutting -- engulfed by fire, Will and
Georgia have no escape. Will returns to Georgia and kneels
down next to her, pulling her close...

WILL (cont'd)
Daddy loves who?

Georgia begins to cry...

GEORGIA
Me.

WILL
Who?

GEORGIA
Me.

Will holds his daughter tight, protecting her to the last.
The flames rise around them, a funeral pyre a mile in the
air. Suddenly there's a

HISSING SOUND.

From all sides, The Pearl's anti-fire measures kick in,
dousing the observation deck with FLAME-SUPPRESSING FOAM and
CO2 GAS. Will can't believe it.

INT. THE PEARL - VARIOUS FLOORS - NIGHT

-- QUICK CUTS of FIRE SYSTEMS COMING ONLINE on various

floors, extinguishing the remaining flames with WATER and
FLAME-SUPPRESSING FOAM.

116.
CONTINUED:

The fire is rapidly quelled. Zhao's building, once enabled,
is a formidable foe and ardent defender of its corpus.

EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - NIGHT

The GATHERED CROWD stares up at The Pearl, watching as floor
by floor, the flashing golden fire is put out. They begin
to cheer, slowly at first, then wildly.

EXT. THE PEARL - SKYLINE - DAWN

The first rays of a new day pierce the eastern sky,
revealing The Pearl, smoking but standing tall. Unbowed.
EXT. THE PEARL - GROUND LEVEL - DAY

The crowd has thinned some now. Suddenly a commotion is
heard. People pull out their phones, a buzz zips through
the gathering as citizens begin to part revealing:

WILL, GEORGIA AND ZHAO

moving away from The Pearl's MAIN ENTRANCE DOOR. Will
carries Georgia in one arm and supports Zhao with the other.

The trio collapse. Will calls out to the gawking crowd...

WILL
Call an ambulance!

Suddenly a RUSH OF POLICE OFFICERS push through the crowd
surrounding Will, weapons drawn. Will puts his hands up.

WILL (cont'd)
No -- no -- this man, he needs help!

But no one moves. Will implores them...

WILL (cont'd)
Please!

Will's shoulders slump -- after all of this, he's still seen
as a criminal. It's almost more than he can bear.

Just then, a bark of Chinese and the cops part to reveal

Captain Chan striding up. A quick nod from Chan allows EMT
TECHS to pass by and rush to Zhao's aid.

(CONTINUED)
117.

CONTINUED:
CAPTAIN CHAN
Will Ford -- I've been dying to meet
you.
WILL

My wife and son? Are they okay? Are
they alive?

CAPTAIN CHAN
Ask them yourself.

Chan swings out of the way to reveal:
SARAH AND HENRY
pushing through the throng, rushing toward them...

GEORGIA
Mom!

Sarah drops to her knees to hug her daughter as Will
watches, emotion overwhelming him -- his family safe.

Will moves to them, kneeling down as the trio envelop him in
their arms. Overcome, tears begin to fall down Will's dirt-
streaked face.

We HOLD ON this familial embrace, RISING UP and then, as if
by miracle, it begins to snow. Tiny swirling flakes that
won't survive impact -- but it is snowing all the same.

From above we watch the snow fall as a tumult of PEOPLE and
PARAMEDICS and POLICE eddy around the quartet.

But Will, Sarah, Henry and Georgia remain solid, together --
a rock amidst a rushing stream.

The moment is unmistakable: Will has finally saved the
family he couldn't save those many years ago -- his own.

FADE OUT.
