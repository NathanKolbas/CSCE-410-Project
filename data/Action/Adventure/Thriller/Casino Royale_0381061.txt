SUPER: MADAGASCAR, We're watching a fight to the death
between a cobra and a mongoose. The arena is a derelict

empty swimming pool; the audience hundreds of screaming

men, urging the animals on. Beyond this, a cluster of
erewded shacks and deserted buildings, housing their near
starving families. From a second floor we see a man looking
down at the spectacle. James Bond, almost unrecognizable,
part of scenery. He keeps his eye on a disheveled young

man amongst the excited crowd. The youth wears a small
backpack and has a white livid burn scar on his right arm:
CARTER, Bond’s team mate is also in the crowd watching.

But Bond doesn’t flinch, a ruthless determination driving
him on. Bomber runs for the building, the digger charging
over the girders, catching him up.

Behind them, a security vehicle races through the gate,
siren screaming. Climbing to the first floor level of the
building, Bomber barely makes it as Bond rams the digger’s
bucket into the concrete floor, tearing it up, right behind
Bombers legs. The digger stalls and Bond leaps through

towards the embassy building. He curses under his breath;
makes a decision. Climbing onto the roof, he launches
himself over the concrete wall, lands amongst the shrubbery
in the embassy gardens. Rolling onto one knee, looks back
at the security gate. All quiet. Glancing up he sees
security cameras attached to the building. He moves off.

They can’t see Bond and Bomber because they’re lying below

balcony. That doesn’t stop them. They open up, shattering
the wood and glass partitions above the banister. Glass

He pops the glove compartment and pulls out the interior

wound on his arm -- the blood swirling down the sink. He
sticks on a quick bandage, wipes the blood off the
