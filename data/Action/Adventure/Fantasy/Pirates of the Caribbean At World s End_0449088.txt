PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CALYPSO'S FURY
screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio
Green Revision (January 31, 2006)

Here is a late production draft of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT
WORLD'S END. You'll notice a different title, Calypso's Fury. This
title was never in serious contention, simply a working title, until
marketing deadlines forced the eventual title to be determined.

FADE UP: SHACKLED FEET. CHAINS drag along the ground. PIRATES,
led to their final reward -- the gallows. FOOTSTEPS climb the
wooden steps. An air of expectancy. TILT UP to REVEAL --

EXT. FORT - DAY

A PIRATE CABIN BOY stands on the gallows. A noose is fitted
around his neck. Among the PIRATES in line, a TUNE begins,
hummed low.

Then the Cabin Boy begins to sing, low and wavering, focused
only on the song and not those who have come see him hang --

CABIN BOY (0.S.)
Yo, ho, haul together, hoist the
colours high ... heave ho, thieves
and beggars, never shall we die...

The Cabin Boy closes his eyes --

IN THE BLACKNESS, a SILVER COIN FALLS, tumbling slowly. It is a
SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT, irregular, golden light glinting off its
rough surface --

CABIN BOY
The king and his men stole the queen
from her bed and bound her in her
bones ...

BACK TO SCENE: as a PIRATE waiting joins in, sings low:

PIRATE
The seas be ours and by the powers
where we will -- we'll roam...

In the crowd stands SIR CUTLER BECKETT among OFFICERS of the
EAST INDIA TRADING COMPANY. He frowns at the waiting
prisoners, as more pick up the song:

PRISONERS
Yo, ho, haul together, hoist the
colours high ... heave ho, thieves
and beggars, never say we die...

Beckett gives a nod. A wood-SQUEAK, THUNK as the gallows
trap-door opens --

IN DARKNESS, the SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT tumbles and turns ...

AT THE GALLOWS, the line of Pirates watch with dread and
fascination as the young man dances his final dance. Another Pirate
is led to the noose --

OLD MAN (0.S.)
Some men have died and some are alive
And others sail on the sea -- with
the keys to the cage ... and the
devil to pay ... we lay to Fiddler's
Green!

AT THE GALLOWS, another SQUEAK, THUNK and CRY as the hapless
Pirate falls to his doom --

ALL PIRATES
Yo, ho, haul together, hoist the
colours high -- HEAVE HO, THIEVES
AND BEGGARS, NEVER SHALL WE DIE ...

A lever pulled. Another pirate SWINGS. A rope tightens.
Another pirate HANGS. Faster and faster. Beckett smiles. A
DOZEN PIRATES now dangle at the END of their ROPES -- anda
FINAL PIRATE drops down, boots CLOSE IN FRAME --

The SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT lands on a table, spins and wobbles to
a stop. TEAGUE, Pirate Lord of Madagascar, stares out a window,
the weight of ill news in his eyes.

Behind him, on a table, lies the Silver Piece of Eight, next
to a candle, an open envelope, and letter

Teague's hand picks up the coin, clutches it -- and the candle
GOES OUT --

CUT TO BLACK
A PAUSE, then ... a WOMAN'S VOICE out of the DARKNESS ...
ELIZABETH (0.S.)
The bell has been raised from its
watery grave ... do you hear its
sepulchral tone?

A small boat emerges out of the gloom. Elizabeth moves it
with a long pole through a maze of pylons. We are --

EXT. SINGAPORE - HARBOR - NIGHT

Junks crammed together around ramshackle docks. Criss-crossing
shadows from hanging lamps.

UNDER THE DOCKS, Elizabeth moves past raised platforms, sees:
an OLD LADY crouches, gutting fish ... an ARTISAN blows glass

over a coal FIRE ... a LAUGHING BOY outside a FIREWORKS SHED
lights a pinwheel; it spins, sparks flying --

The SHADOW of a MONKEY races past. Elizabeth's apprehension
grows. It's all weird, surreal. She keeps singing --

ELIZABETH (0.S.)
A call to all, pay heed the squall --

509 EXT. SINGAPORE - DOCKS - NIGHT 509
On the dock, Elizabeth ties the bow line.

ELIZABETH
-- and turn your sails toward home!
Yo ho, haul together --

EAST INDIA COMPANY MEN, including MERCER, approach. She re-
ties the line as they pass. Then resumes the song.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Raise the colors high! Heave ho --

HUANG (0.S.)
-- thieves and beggars, never say we
die.

THREE GUARDS appear out of the darkness of a huge sewer pipe.
Their leader is TAI HUANG.

HUANG (CONT'D)

A dangerous song to be singing, for

any who are ignorant of its meaning.
Particularly a woman. Particularly a
woman alone.

BARBOSSA (0.S.)
What makes you think she's alone?

The Guards turn. BARBOSSA stands behind them, smiling.

HUANG
You protect her?
ELIZABETH
What makes you think I need

protection?
Huang shouldn't have turned away: her knife is at his throat.

BARBOSSA
Your master is expecting us.
(to Elizabeth)
And an unexpected death would cast a
slight pall on our meeting.

Elizabeth lowers the knife.

HUANG
You're Captain Barbossa.

BARBOSSA
Aye. And she be Elizabeth Swann. And
Sao Feng has promised us safe passage.

HUANG
For as long as it suits him.

Huang turns to lead them away -- stops, holds up a hand.

East India Company AGENTS go past. Huang gestures 'follow
me' and leads them toward the huge sewer pipe --

EXT. SINGAPORE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The East India Company Agents keep a look out. DROP DOWN to
the water below --

IN THE WATER, a dozen or so COCONUTS float lazily with the
current. And then one rises up -- the TOP of PINTEL's head.
Others rise out of the water -- coconut shells worn like
helmets by GIBBS, RAGETTI, COTTON and MARTY.

They carry oilskin bundles, take out large rasps, wait, poised
to file through the bars of a metal grate --

ON THE AGENTS: as they hear wheels SQUEAKING, turn to see:

TIA DALMA, pushing a cart carrying bird cages with twittering
canaries; potions, bottles and bags of flour. Cotton's PARROT
perches atop; JACK THE MONKEY turns the crank of an ORGAN --

BENEATH THE DOCK -- Gibbs and his crew begin filing through the
grate, the noise covered by the music --

EXT. SINGAPORE - BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

As Huang leads Barbossa and Elizabeth toward the door of a
low-slung, decrepit bath house. The two confer in whispers:

ELIZABETH
Have we heard anything from Will?

BARBOSSA
The whelp is more than capable of
taking care of himself. But you, in
the presence of Sao Feng, you'll be
wanting to show a bit more diffidence
than is your custom.

ELIZABETH
He's that terrifying, is he?

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 5.

BARBOSSA
He's much like myself, absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair
play.

Huang raps out a signal on the door. A slit opens, eyes scan
him, the slit closes, the door opens --
EXT. SINGAPORE - UNDER THE DOCKS - NIGHT 514

Pintel and Ragetti keep filing -- until suddenly the music
STOPS. Ragetti files one stroke too many, oops --

ON THE DOCKS, one of the Agents regards the Monkey, holding it up 515
with the tip of his sword. The other pokes at the cart.

AGENT
(to Tia Dalma)
You can't be here.

Tia Dalma lifts her face -- they see she is BLIND.
TIA DALMA
Your mother always knew it be you
who threw the linens down the well.
But she forgave you for it.

AGENT
How did you know that?

TIA DALMA
The canaries.

She grins a black-teeth smile. The Agents jump back. Jack
the Monkey goes back to grinding, the music picks up --

BELOW, Pintel and Ragetti return to sawing -- 516
INT. BATH HOUSE VESTIBULE - NIGHT 517
Huang stops, bars Barbossa and Elizabeth's way.

HUANG
No weapons. Remove them, please.

BARBOSSA
Of course.

Barbossa and Elizabeth lose their swords, pistols. Huang
holds up a hand to stop Elizabeth. He gestures to her coat.

HUANG
Did you you think because she is a
woman, we would not suspect her of
treachery?
518

519

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 6.

BARBOSSA
When you put it that way ...

HUANG
Remove, please.

Elizabeth strips off her coat. Huang takes it, and reveals
two swords in hidden scabbards in the lining. Again, they
start past -- Huang stops Elizabeth. AGAIN. Smiles.

HUANG (CONT'D)
Remove. Please.

Elizabeth looks indignant --
INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

ON ELIZABETH, self-conscious in a short robe and nothing
else. She and Barbossa follow a DRAGON TATTOOED half-naked
pirate into the bath house. They move past algae-covered
tubs and leaky, rusted pipes. Elizabeth notes: all of the
men have the same DRAGON TATTOO.

SAO FENG steps out of a tub; two attendants -- LIAN and PARK
(in corset-like outfits) -- dress him in full pirate garb.

Sao Feng does not acknowledge Barbossa and Elizabeth's
presence. Barbossa gets it; he must speak first.

BARBOSSA
Captain Sao Feng. Thank you for
granting me this audience.

SAO FENG
Captain Barbossa! Welcome to
Singapore.
(to a guard)
More steam.

The Guard bangs on the wall twice --
INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Two short ATTENDANTS work the boiler and bellow system that
feeds steam to the bathhouse above. Gibbs crawls out of a

tunnel, followed by Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton ... and then
Marty, who did not have to crawl. They see the attendants
smile at each other -- no problem --

A HUGE ATTENDANT comes into view. Problem. Ragetti moves to
crawl back into the tunnel. Gibbs grabs his collar --

GIBBS
(sotto)
None of that.
(MORE )

518

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 7.

GIBBS (CONT'D)
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance we have
it won't go as bad as we expect.

520 INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 520

STEAM issues from the pipes. Sao Feng leans over a vent,
waving it into his face.

SAO FENG
I understand that you have a request
to make of me ..?

BARBOSSA
And a proposal to make to you. I've
a venture underway, and I find myself
in need of a ship and a crew.

SAO FENG
And you consider me worthy of such
an honor? A ship and crew ...
(a chuckle)
Huh. That's an odd coincidence.

ELIZABETH
Because you happen to have a ship
and a crew you don't need?

Barbossa gives her a warning glance.

SAO FENG
No. Because earlier this day, not
far from here, a thief broke into my
most revered uncle's temple, and
tried to make off with these ...

Sao Feng crosses to a wizened OLD MAN, who clutches ANCIENT
CHARTS to his chest. Sao Feng tries to take them -- but the
Old Man really does not want to let them go.

A look from Sao Feng, and the man releases them.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)

Navigational charts. The route to
the Farthest Gate.

(Barbossa's smile

falters slightly)
Wouldn't it be amazing if this venture
of yours took you to the world beyond
this one?

BARBOSSA
It would strain credulity, at that.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 8.

Sao Feng gazes at him levelly. He nods to two GUARDS near
one of the baths. The Guards haul a FIGURE out of the tank --

It's WILLIAM TURNER. He gasps for breath. Sao Feng grabs him
by the hair, displays his face to Elizabeth and Barbossa.

SAO FENG
This is the thief. Is his face
familiar to you?

Both play it cool: neither have ever seen him before. Sao
Feng studies them, shrugs -- and picks up a huge FID --

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
No? Then I guess he has no further
need for it.

He prepares to stab Will with the fid -- Elizabeth tenses --
Sao Feng spots the tell. His pleasant demeanor is gone.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)

You come into my city, you seek my
indulgence and largesse, and you
betray my hospitality? You betray

me?

BARBOSSA
Sao Feng, I assure you, I had no
idea --

SAO FENG

-- that he would get caught.
Sao Feng stares. Barbossa shrugs: yeah, okay.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
You intend to attempt a voyage to
Davy Jones' Locker. And I cannot
help but wonder: why?

Barbossa tosses something to Sao Feng, who catches it -- a
silver PIECE OF EIGHT. Sao Feng examines it.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
A piece of eight.

(looks up at Barbossa)
It's true, then?

BARBOSSA
Aye. The time is upon us. We must
convene the Brethren Court.
He BANGS twice on the wall. No steam.

SAO FENG
More steam!
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 9.
521 INT. BOILER ROOM - NIGHT 521

Marty sits atop the huge Attendant, tightening a knot. Cotton
puzzles out the boiler mechanism. Gibbs, Pintel and Ragetti
move out of the room, further under the bathhouse --

522 INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 522
Sao Feng leans over a vent, breathes in the soothing steam.

SAO FENG
The Court has not met in my lifetime.

BARBOSSA
Nor mine.

Sao Feng toys with a Captain's knot pendant at his neck.

SAO FENG
And when last it did, my father told
me, it ended ... badly.

BARBOSSA
But the time before that, it produced
the Code, which has served us well
and it was the very first meeting
what gave us no less than rule of
the sea herself, didn't it? And now
that rule is being challenged.

SAO FENG
The East India Trading Company.

BARBOSSA
(nods)
Lord Cutler Beckett is a pox on us
all.

523 INT. BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 523

Oilskin bundles are unrolled: swords, pistols and grenades.
The pirates place the grenades in the floor joists.

Ragetti's attention is drawn to a knothole. He peeks through.
Gets a better angle with his wooden eye. It catches Pintel's
attention. Ragetti point up, mouths "Elizabeth!"

524 INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 524

SAO FENG
There is a price on all our heads
it is true. It seems the only way a
pirate can turn a profit anymore ...
(he regards Will)
. is by betraying other pirates.
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 10.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
(back to Barbossa)

But pirates are either Captain or
crew, and nine squabbling captains
trying to chart a course is eight
captains too many. Against the
company, what value is the Brethren
Court? What can any of us do?

ELIZABETH
You can fight.

She realizes she said that out loud. All eyes on her.

525 INT. BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 525
Pintel shoves Ragetti aside, peers through the knothole --

526 INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 526
Elizabeth steps forward:

ELIZABETH
You are Sao Feng, the Pirate Lord of
Singapore. You command in the Age of
Piracy, where bold Captains sail
free waters, where waves are not
measured in feet but increments of
fear, and those who pass the test
become legend.

A huge dragon TATTOO GUY steps forward to put a hand on
Elizabeth's shoulder. She shrugs him off, continues:

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Would you have that era come to an
end on your watch?

527 INT. BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 527

Pintel flinches at the sight, gives Ragetti a dismayed look:
what are you smoking, dude?

528 INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 528

ELIZABETH
But here you are: your ships crowd
the harbor, rotting on their lines,
while you cower in your bath water

Sao Feng regards her, makes a circle around her

SAO FENG
Elizabeth Swann ... There is more to
you than meets the eye, isn't there?
And the eye does not go wanting.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 11.
He smiles charmingly at her -- she can't help but smile back

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
(to Barbossa)
But I can't help but notice you have
failed to answer my question. What
is it you seek in Davy Jones' Locker?

WILL
Jack Sparrow.

Sao Feng freezes. The room goes dead still, too.

WILL (CONT'D)
He's one of the pirate lords.

Park, one of the twins, giggles at the name -- stops smiling
when Sao Feng glares at her. LIAN hides her own smile. Sao
Feng works to hide his rage.

SAO FENG
The only reason I would want Jack
Sparrow returned from the realm of
the dead is so I can send him back
myself.

BARBOSSA
Exactly why we preferred his name go
unmentioned.

UNDER THIS: Sao Feng spots: The DRAGON TATTOO of one of his
Guards is MELTING -- STENG.

SAO FENG
So you admit you have deceived me.

BARBOSSA
Jack Sparrow holds one of the Nine
Pieces of Eight! He failed pass it
along to a successor before he died.
And so we must go and fetch him back --
Sao Feng catches Huang's eye, directs him toward Steng

SAO FENG
WEAPONS !

Sao Feng's men (and women) produce weapons from beneath the
water in the tubs --

529 INT. CRAWL SPACE - BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE 529

Gibbs and the others exchange a glance -- it's gone bad --
530

531

532

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 12.
INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 530

Barbossa and Elizabeth are suddenly at the center of a ring
of weapons pointed at them.

BARBOSSA
I assure you our intentions are
strictly honorable --

He has his hands spread wide -- and then, suddenly, SWORDS
are pushed up through the floor boards ... and Barbossa finds
himself holding a sword in each hand. Crap. Elizabeth has

two swords; she tosses one across the room to Will.

Sao Feng holds the point of the fid to Steng's face.
SAO FENG
Drop your weapons, or I kill your
man!

Barbossa frowns. Confused looks from Barbossa to Will to
Elizbeth. Back to Sao Feng. Barbossa shrugs.

BARBOSSA
Kill him. He's not our man.

WILL
If he's not with you, and not us ...
who is he with?

The question is answered as suddenly EAST INDIA TRADING
COMPANY AGENTS storm in -- CRASHING through windows --

Instantly, the Pirates turn back-to-back to face this new
threat. Sao Feng spins away from Steng to fight.

Will grabs another sword from below and wades into the battle --
INT. CRAWL SPACE - BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE 531

Pintel and Ragetti light a fuse, to a grenade attached to
one of the joists -- EXPLOSION --

INT. BATH HOUSE - NIGHT 532
THE BATH HOUSE IS ROCKED, and half the floorboards drop down,

making a ramp. Gibbs, Marty, Cotton, Pintel and Ragetti rush

in, firing pistols, join the fighting --

As MERCER strides in with a phalanx of SOLDIERS. Lian attacks
him with a sword; he fires at her, killing her point blank --

Park pulls a steel chopstick out of her hair, sets out for
vengeance. Pirates flee and scatter --
533

534

535

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 13.
EXT. SINGAPORE - DOCKS - VARIOUS - NIGHT 533

Our heroes flee down ramps, up ladders, swing on ropes. East
India Trading Company AGENTS fire pistols, engage with swords --

Amid the fighting, a stack of crates is knocked over. Pintel
pushes Steng out of the way, saving him.

Steng grins his thanks -- then suddenly slashes at Pintel,
who jumps back.

PINTEL
Hey! You're a pirate!

Steng slashes, Pintel falls backwards over a rail --

Elizabeth and Barbossa, Cotton and Marty take on an array of
East India Trading Company AGENTS --

Agents crouch behind the push-cart of Tia Dalma. The canaries fly 534
away from it, through open doors of their cages. The Agents realize
something is wrong, and run --

Just as the cart EXPLODES --

ON A PLATFORM, a wall collapses and Mercer is knocked back, into 535
the shadows. He pulls a steel chopstick out of one shoulder
then the other. Looks up and sees --

Will comes around a bamboo scrim -- where Sao Feng grabs
him. He puts a knife to Will's throat. Fighting, gunfire
explosions can be seen past them, through the scrim.

SAO FENG
Odd coincidence, isn't it? The East
India Trading Company finds me the
day you show up in Singapore.

WILL
It is coincidence only.

Will twists away, flashes his own knife; Sao Feng blocks it.
Mercer, unseen, grins and draws his pistol, aims --

WILL (CONT'D)
You want to cut a deal with Beckett?
You need what I offer.

ON MERCER, ready to fire -- but hesitates.

SAO FENG
You crossed Barbossa, you're willing
to cross Jack Sparrow -- why should
I expect any better?
536

537

538

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 14.
WILL
They are in the way of what I want.
You're helping me get it.

Sao Feng accepts this logic, but has a final point:

SAO FENG
You betray me, and I will slit your
throat.

WILL

Then we have an understanding.
They each lower their knives. Sao Feng hands Will the charts.

ON THE DOCKS, Jack the Monkey lights a rocket. The rocket shoots 536
across the water, into the fireworks shed. EXPLOSIONS, and the
shed TILTS OVER, SPLASHES --

ON THE PLATFORMS, Barbossa and Elizabeth arrive, see Will, holding 537
the charts, standing with Tai Huang.

BARBOSSA
You have the charts!

WILL
And better.
(indicates Huang)
A ship and a crew.

ELIZABETH
Where's Sao Feng?

WILL
He will cover our escape -- then
meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

HUANG
This way. Be quick.

Barbossa nods; he and Will follow Tai Huang away, followed
by Elizabeth, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton. ON MERCER, still hidden
. he recedes back into the shadows.
EXT. HAI PENG - DECK - NIGHT 538

The Chinese Junk sails out of the harbor. The night sky GLOWS
from FIRES burning in Singapore. Barbossa confronts Will.

BARBOSSA
You weren't supposed to get caught.

WILL
It worked out the way I wanted.
539

540

541

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 15.

He moves away -- past, Elizabeth who looks out from the rail --
there are dozens of ships clustered on shore. Beyond them,
the glow of Singapore as it burns.

ELIZABETH
There's no place left for him to
cower. Do you think he will honor
the call?

Tia Dalma steps up behind her
TIA DALMA

I cannot say. There be something on

the seas that even the most staunch

and bloodthirsty pirates have come

to fear --
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY 539
The Dutchman SURFACES. CANNON PORTS open. CANNONS FIRE --
rapid, no time for reloading -- PIRATES SHIPS are hit
BROADSIDES. Their cannons return fire.

The Dutchman's cannons go silent. Smoke drifts from the
barrels, becoming ...

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY - LATER 540

. smoke that the Flying Dutchman sails through regally,
smoke issuing from burning wreckage. It sails past, revealing:

IN THE DISTANCE, the Endeavour rides majestic on the horizon --
INT. ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY 541

A MAP of the world; ship models representing squadrons.
Several officers pore over it.

A PIECE OF EIGHT spins on a desktop; a hand slams down on
it: Beckett's. He picks it up, examines it. The Dead Man's
Chest is on the desk as well.

BECKETT
A piece of eight. Nine of them, you
said?

MERCER

Our new friend in Singapore was very
specific, sir: nine pieces of eight.

BECKETT
What is the significance of that, I
wonder?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 16.

MERCER
Does it matter? There's nothing can
hold against the armada,
(taps fingers on chest)
not with the Flying Dutchman at the
lead.

BECKETT
Nothing we know of. Did our friend
happen to mention where the Brethren
Court is meeting?

MERCER
He was mum on that, sir.

BECKETT
Then he understand the value of
information. Speaking of ... best

keep all this to ourselves.

He glances across the room, where SWANN sits at a table,
signing orders, one after another.

BECKETT (CONT'D)
We can't have anyone running off to
Singapore, can we? Ah, Admiral!

Now-Admiral NORRINGTON has entered the cabin.

NORRINGTON
You summoned me, Lord Beckett?

BECKETT
Yes. Something there that better
suits your new station.

He nods to a long wooden box on a sideboard. Norrington thinks
he recognizes it, opens it. Inside is his SWORD. A glance

back at Beckett, who nods. Norrington lifts the sword,
considering what it means.

UNDER THIS:

BECKETT (CONT'D)
The Brethren know they face
extinction. All that's left is for
them to decide where they will make
their final stand.

ON SWANN - a clerk sets a sheaf of documents before him.

SWANN
Not more requisition orders.

CLERK
No, sir. Execution.
542

543

544

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 17.

Swann is distressed by that; briefly, he makes eye contact
with Norrington. Both men quickly look away. Swann picks up
his quill, resumes his distasteful task

GROVES enters, salutes Beckett.

GROVES
The attack is ended, sir

EXT. ENDEAVOUR - DAY 542

Governor Swann stares out at sections of blasted hull,
floating barrels, and bodies. Beckett and Norrington arrive,
gaze out at the carnage.

NORRINGTON
Appalling.

Beckett raises his spyglass.

BECKETT
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.
(to Norrington)
Prepare to lower the boat. Fetch the
chest.

Swann wants to turn away, but forces himself to look --
INT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY 543

Music plays. Jones gazes at the locket with the picture of
hanging from the pipe organ. He lifts it gently ...

A tear forms in his eye. Jones touches a knuckle to the tear --
and is stunned by its presence, by his own emotions. He knows
the cause, glances toward the deck --

EXT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - DECK - DAY 544

The Dead Man's Chest is brought over the rail, guarded by
MARINES, including MURTOGG and MULLROY, and led by Norrington.

Norrington takes in the ship, the crewmen, not happy to be
there. He notes the fear in his men.

NORRINGTON
Steady, men. We stand aboard a
seagoing vessel, no more and no less.
You will comport yourself as marines.

Murtogg puts a hand on a rail, snatches it back, disgusted.

MULLROY
Oh, now, it's not all that bad. A
little bit of elbow grease, is all
she needs.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 18.

MURTOGG
We set the grease on fire?

MULLROY
And get away as fast as we can.

MURTOGG
It's a two-part plan.

MULLROY
That's how you know it's a good one.

Jones strides up, but keeps his distance from the chest.

JONES
Go, the lot of you -- and take that
with you! I will not have that
infernal thing on my ship!

BECKETT
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Because
I will. Because it seems to be the
only way to ensure this ship do as
directed by the Company.

Jones grips the ship's rail with his claw. Beckett nods,
indicates Norrington should continue away with the chest.

JONES
The Dutchman sails as its Captain
commands.

BECKETT

And the Captain is to sail it as
commanded. This is no longer your
world, Jones. The immaterial has
become ... immaterial. I would have
thought you'd learned that when I
ordered you to kill your pet.

Swann steps forward.

SWANN
Did you give those ships opportunity
to surrender?

JONES
We let them see us. Methinks that
opportunity enough.

SWANN
My daughter could have been aboard
one of them! That alone is cause to
exercise restraint!
545

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 19.

BECKETT
We need prisoners to interrogate.
Which works best when they are alive.

JONES

I am exterminating pirates. As
commanded by the Company.

(to Swann)
And your daughter is dead. Pulled
under with the Black Pearl -- by my
pet. Did Lord Beckett not tell you
that?

Swann is taken aback with shock -- then whirls and runs for
the cabin. Beckett gives Jones a dark look, follows --

INT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - CABIN - DAY 545

The chest is set in place. The key inserted into the lock by
Norrington. He opens the chest; the BEATING HEART is inside.

Swann comes into the cabin, purposeful. The MARINES
immediately point their rifles at the heart. Swann grabs one
of their bayonets, intending to plunge it into the heart --
Norrington grabs his wrist.

NORRINGTON
Governor!

SWANN
Did you know? Did you?

He doesn't know what he's talking about.

SWANN (CONT'D)
She's dead! Elizabeth is dead!

Norrington is stunned. Swann breaks down. Norrington jerks
his head to the marines: leave. They do.

Swann regains his purpose --

SWANN (CONT'D)
Let me go! Let me do this!

JONES (0.S.)
Let him go.

Jones is in the doorway.

SWANN
Stay back! I will kill you!
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 20.

JONES
And are you prepared for what comes
after? When I carved that traitorous
vessel from my body, I cast upon it
a terrible geis. If you stab my heart
. then yours will take its place.

The import of that is not lost on Swann and Norrington.

JONES (CONT'D)
The crew is not bound to me, they
are bound to the Dutchman ... and
the Dutchman must have a captain.
Will ye serve?

Swann hesitates -- Beckett and Mercer arrived in time to
hear the end of Jones' speech. Beckett is none too pleased.
BECKETT
Governor! Your daughter is still
alive.
MERCER

Saw her myself, in Singapore.

That's news to Jones; he snaps an angry look at Beckett.
Beckett waves him off.

SWANN
You're all liars!

BECKETT
No. Jones is merely cruel. But perhaps
I am guilty of sin by omission. For
which I apologize.

NORRINGTON
Governor ... Weatherby ... there's
still hope.
Swann searches his face -- he, at least, is sincere.

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I have hope.

The anger drains from Swann's face. He releases the bayonet
to Norrington. To Beckett:

SWANN
Our association is ended.

Norrington escorts him out, past Beckett -- he gives Beckett
a narrow look: he does not like what he just heard.
546

547

548

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 21.

BECKETT
You're dismissed, Captain.

Jones gives him the same narrow look, exits. Beckett
contemplates his options as he shuts the chest softly.

MERCER
He's a sly one, that Jones. Who's
going to kill him, if they become
him?

Beckett considers that; not good.

BECKETT
I can order Admiral Norrington's
silence. He'll obey; it's what he
does.

MERCER
And the governor?

Beckett considers; he is genuinely regretful.
BECKETT
Yes. Well. Every man should have a
secret he carries to his grave.
EXT. HAI PENG - DECK - DUSK 546

Will makes a line fast -- notices a speck of water on the
back of his hand. Looks up --

Many SNOWFLAKES are falling down onto the ship.

EXT. BETWEEN WORLDS - ICE PASSAGE - DUSK 547
The Hai Peng sails into a frozen glacial landscape.

EXT. HAI PENG - DECK - DUSK 548

The monkey, shivering. Ragetti, shivering. Pintel, shivering.
Tia Dalma stands nearby, not shivering.

PINTEL
No one said anything about cold.
RAGETTI
I'm sure there's good reason for us
suffering.
PINTEL

Why didn't the obeah woman just bring
back Jack the way she brought back
Barbossa?
549

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 22.

TIA DALMA
Because Barbossa was only dead.

He didn't know she was standing there.

TIA DALMA (CONT'D)
Jack Sparrow be taken body and soul,
to a place not of death, but
punishment. The worst fate a person
can conjure for himself, stretching
on forever ... That's what awaits in
Davy Jones' Locker.

She moves away.

RAGETTI
I knew there was a good reason.
CLOSE ON: THE MAP, as Will moves the circles within circles of 549
the chart. In the center, a drawing of a ship rotates.
WILL
(to Huang)

Nothing here is set. It can't be as
accurate as modern charts.

HUANG
No. But it leads to more places.

Will stares after Huang as he moves away. Will's focus moves
to one of the inscribed poems. He frowns.

WILL
"Over the edge, back, over again,
sunrise sets, flash of green." Do
you care to interpret, Barbossa?

BARBOSSA
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Mister Gibbs?

GIBBS
I reckon I've seen my share.
(to Will)

Happens on rare occasion, at the

last glimpse of sunset, a green flash
shoots up into the sky. Some go their
whole lives and never see it. Some
claim to have seen it who ain't.

Some say --

PINTEL
-- it signals when a soul comes back
to this world from the dead!
(Gibbs glares at him)
Sorry.
550

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 23.
Pintel slinks away, joins Ragetti.

RAGETTI
Don't they get it? It's a riddle.
Riddles are fun. "Over the edge,
back, over again --"

PINTEL
Riddles are not fun! The way it always
goes is some poor bloke ends up dead,
but just beforehand he realizes no,
I wasn't supposed to listen to the
sirens, I wasn't supposed to take
the pot ‘gold, but by then it's too
late and he dies in a horrible and
ofttimes ironical manner, and in
this case, you and I be the poor
bloke!

By the time Pintel is done with his rant, all on deck are
staring at him. Barbossa grins.

BARBOSSA
See, Mister Turner? We will finda
way. It's not getting to the land of
the dead is the problem -- it's
getting back!
EXT. HAI PENG - DECK - NIGHT 550

Elizabeth stands beneath a lantern at the rail. She stares
out at the dark sea. The icebergs are gone. Will joins her

The ocean before them is a mirror, stars above and below.
A silence between Will and Elizabeth. Finally:

WILL
How long do we continue not talking?

In fact Elizabeth doesn't want to talk. But --
ELIZABETH
Once we rescue Jack, everything will
be fine.

There are many ways to intrepret those words and Will runs
through them all. Finally concludes:

WILL
Then we will rescue Jack
Elizabeth nods, steps back from the rail -- turns and leaves.
Will leans forward, arms on the rail ... and notices:

Far away, a line of white mist stretches to infinity.
551

552

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 24.

WILL (CONT'D)
Barbossa! Ahead!

BARBOSSA
Aye, these be the waters I know.
We're good and lost now.

ELIZABETH
Lost?

BARBOSSA
For certain you have to be lost, to
find a place as can't be found.
Elseways everyone would know where
it was, aye?

Barbossa laughs. Gibbs looks over the rail --

GIBBS
We're gaining speed ...

WILL
To stations! All hands! To stations!

The ship gathers more speed, and the SOUND of RAGING WATER
is heard.

WILL (CONT'D)
Rudder full! Hard a-port! Gather way
and keep her trim!

Pirates scramble to comply -- Barbossa strides forward.
BARBOSSA
Belay that! Let her run straight and
true!

Will climbs the rigging, looks out --

WILL
Hard a-port!
FROM ABOVE, we see the Hai Peng as it fights the pull of the 551
current, turning -- but not sharp enough

PULL BACK AND REVEAL: an endlessly long WATERFALL where the
ocean itself flows over and down into nothingness

THE EDGE OF THE WORLD.
EXT. DECK HAI PENG - NIGHT 552
Tia Dalma appears on deck. Unlike those around her, she is

calm and serene. She tosses her crab claws down onto a barrel
head. Leans over them, murmurs an INCANTATION.
553

554

555

556

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 25.

TIA DALMA
Malfaiteur en Tombeau, Crochir
1'Esplanade, Dans 1'Fond d'1' eau!

She repeats the phrase, faster and then slower. Moves the
claws around in an intricate, repeating pattern --

The ROAR is now DEAFENING. Will wrestles the wheel. Elizabeth
whirls to Barbossa as he pulls himself to his feet.

ELIZABETH
You've doomed us all.

BARBOSSA
Don't be so unkind! Ye may not
survive to pass this way again --
and these be the last friendly words
ye'll hear

FROM ABOVE, the Hai Peng continues to turn, fighting to escape
. near sideways now to the edge.

The hull of the Hai Peng sticks out into the air ... and
then the entire ship TILTS over and TOPPLES DOWN --

Elizabeth SCREAMS ... Barbossa LAUGHS ... all the Pirates CRY OUT
as the ship plummets down into --

BLACKNESS.

And SILENCE. Then SINGING and LAUGHTER. Various pirate voices,
distant, eerie ... "Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me..."

And just as quickly as they came, the voices FADE ...
FADE UP:

A WHITE HOT SUN burns in a cloudless blue sky.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY

A loose sail flaps in the wind. The sail is pulled aside to
reveal CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW. He makes it fast, calls up:

JACK
Boatswain! Haul the halyard, slacken
braces!
PAN UP TO -- surprise! -- JACK SPARROW, a second one, in the

rigging. Jack waves and calls down:
JACK (BOATSWAIN) (CONT'D)
Aye, Captain! Slacken braces, men
make all! How does she lie?

ON DECK, a sailor turns: JACK SPARROW again.

553

554

555

556
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 26.

JACK (CONT'D)
A fair wind and a following sea!

Captain Jack nods. In good spirits, he moves along the deck --
then stops and looks down. There is a problem.

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONT'D)
Mister Sparrow, come here.

JACK (BOATSWAIN) (CONT'D)
Aye, Captain!

Jack drops down from the rigging. Captain Jack's demeanor is
rigid, with a gaze that could wither Captain Bly.

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONT'D)
What say ye about the condition of
the knot on this bow line?

JACK (BOATSWAIN) (CONT'D)
It be proper to my eyes, sir.

As he speaks, Captain Jack tugs on the line and it unravels.

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONT'D)
Proper? It is neither proper nor
suitable, sir! It is not acceptable
nor adequate. It is, in obvious fact,
an abomination.

Another Jack steps forward -- earnest, well-meaning.

JACK (HONEST) (CONT'D)
Begging your pardon, sir. Perhaps if
you gave the man another chance --

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONT'D)
It's that sort of thinking that got
us into this mess.

Jack pulls a pistol and SHOOTS honest Jack, who goes stumbling
backwards, over the rail. Jack turns back --

CLOSE ON Jack's face, close enough to see the spittle fly:

JACK (CONT'D)
You have caused us to lose speed and
therefore time. Precious time, which
cannot be recovered once lost. Do
you understand? Aye, Captain. DO YOU
NOW?

PULL BACK to see that there is no one speaking to Jack, and
he speaks to no one. He carries both sides of the argument.
Madness in his eyes.
557

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 27.

JACK (CONT'D)
It will have to be redone. All of
it. All of it! And let this serve as
a lesson to the lot of you!

PULL BACK MORE. We see the true state of the Black Pearl.
Sails flat. No crew. No movement. No other Jack Sparrows.
The Black Pearl sits alone in a vast desert. With Jack
Sparrow, alone, raving on the deck

JACK (CONT'D)
It's the doldrums, sir, it has the
entire crew on edge -- Stow it! I
have no sympathy for any of you
feculent maggots --
(steps up onto rail)
-- and no more patience to pretend

otherwise!
He steps off the rail -- on the wrong side.
EXT. DAVY JONES LOCKER - BLACK PEARL - DAY 557

Jack drops down into the sand next to the Black Pearl. Picks
up a rope and pulls -- his feet dig into the sand; he goes
nowhere. The rope angles up behind him to the ship. He's
trying to pull it, to no avail. He slumps down.

JACK
No wind.

Nearby are several SMOOTH ROUND STONES. Jack picks one up
and FLINGS it, skipping it across the sand. Jack sits down.
Looks over. Weirdly, the stone comes rolling back.

The stone rocks back and forth, an egg hatching. Cracks
appear. The stone transform into a_crab.

The Crab turns toward Jack. Clicks, like it's laughing.

JACK (CONT'D)
Perfect. What would my torment be
without unusual crabs here to mock
me.

Jack grabs a handful of sand and flings it. The crab flinches
back. Jack collapses.

The crab scuttles forward, looks at Jack. Scuttles sideways
looks at the ship. The crab moves away to the pile of stones.

Jack sits with his head lowered to his knees, alone in the
dunes of the vast desert.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 28.
558 EXT. DAVY JONES' LOCKER - DESERT - LATER 558

Jack lays on his back in the sand. Baking in the sun. A SHADOW
MOVES OVER HIM. Jack opens his eyes, blinks.

ANGLE - ABOVE JACK, the PROW of the Black Pearl. Moving.
Jack stands up, sees -- the Black Pearl drifts, floats across
the sand, carried on the back of a thousand chittering crabs.

JACK
Interesting.

559 EXT. DAVY JONES' LOCKER - WATER - DAY 559
The Hai Peng crew stumble out of the surf, bedraggled and *

exhausted. Pintel and Ragetti still carry the ship plank
they clinged to for safety.

RAGETTI *
I hate boats. *
PINTEL *
Really? So, no more waxing all poetic *

"bout how you runned away to sea and
how you's only truly happiest at sea --

RAGETTI *
I still love the sea, it's boats *
that can't be trusted.
Gibbs takes in the utter desolation. *
GIBBS
This be truly a God-forsaken place.
ELIZABETH
I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone.
MARTY
Not a soul.
BARBOSSA

He is here. Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he's took

WILL
(at Barbossa)
And does it matter? We are trapped
here, by your doing. No different
than Jack.

TIA DALMA
Witty Jack be closer than you think.

All eyes turn to Tia Dalma. A DOZEN CRABS appear, moving *
over the sand, scuttling sideways up onto her.
560

561

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 29.*

She balances them on her arms, cooing to them like pets.
Behind her --

JACK SPARROW APPEARS in the sky, at the bow of the Black Pearl,
riding over the desert sand, toward the water, carried on the
backs of ten thousand chittering crabs.

GIBBS
Slap me thrice and hand me to my
momma! It's Jack!

Elizabeth, Gibbs, and Will see Jack and grin -- even Barbossa
has to smile. The ship SPLASHES down --

EXT. DAVY JONES LOCKER - SHORE - LATER

Jack sloshes toward them, the Pearl behind him. Gibbs steps
forward, arms wide, a grin on his face --

JACK
(sharp)
Mister Gibbs.

Gibbs snaps to attention.

GIBBS
Aye, Captain!

JACK
I thought so. I expect you can
account for your actions?

GIBBS (0.S.)
(lost)
Sir?

JACK
There has been a perpetual and
virulent lack of discipline upon my
vessel! Why? Why is that?

GIBBS
Sir -- you're in Davy Jones Locker

JACK
I know that. I know where I am and
don't think I don't.

BARBOSSA
Jack Sparrow.

Jack freezes at the voice, turns. Crew members step back to
reveal: Barbossa. Jack recognizes Barbossa.

JACK
Ah ... Hector. It's been too long.

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 30.*

BARBOSSA (0.S.)
Yes, Isle de Muerta, remember? You
shot me!

JACK
I did not.
(sees Tia Dalma) )
Tia Dalma, out and about! You add an
agreeable sense of the macabre to
any delirium.

WILL
He thinks we're an hallucination?

JACK
Ah, William. Tell me, have you come
because you need my help to save a
certain distressing damsel? I mean,
damsel in distress?
(weighs it briefly)
Either one.

WILL
No.

JACK
Then you wouldn't be here, so you
can't be here, Q.E.D, you're not
really here.

ELIZABETH
Jack.

Jack sees her for the first time.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
This is real. We're here.

Jack looks at her steadily. Fear, mistrust, recognition and
realization. He turns away. Gibbs joins him.

JACK
The Locker you say.

GIBBS
Aye.

Jack nods -- he gets it now.

ELIZABETH
We've come to rescue you!

JACK
Have you now? That's a good one.
Very kind of you.

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 31.

JACK (CONT'D)
But it would seem as I possess a
ship, and you don't, you're the ones
in need of rescuing and I'm not sure
as I'm in the mood.

BARBOSSA
(indicates the Pearl)
I see my ship, right there.

Jack squints, searching, bobs up on his toes, leans side to
side as if he can't find Barbossa's ship.

JACK
Can't spot it. Must be a tiny little
thing hiding somewhere behind the
Pearl.

Barbossa and Jack are about to go at it -- Will steps between.

WILL
Jack, listen. Cutler Beckett has the
heart of Davy Jones. He controls the
Flying Dutchman.

ELIZABETH
He's taking over the seas.

TIA DALMA
The song has been sung. The Brethren
Court is called.

JACK
I leave you folk alone for just a
minute, and look what happens.

GIBBS
Aye, Jack. The world needs you back
something fierce.

WILL
And you need a crew.

Jack looks -- Will, Barbossa, Pintel, Elizabeth and Tia Dalma
are lined up. He steps back, goes down the line --

JACK
Why should I sail with any of you?
Four of you have tried to kill me in
the past.
(he gets to Elizabeth)
One of you succeeded.

Will is startled. Jack notices. (It's news to all of them
of course.)
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 32.

JACK (CONT'D)
She hasn't told you? Then you'll
have lots to talk about while you're
here.

(to Tia Dalma)
As for you --

TIA DALMA
Oh, don't tell me you didn't enjoy
it at the time.

JACK

That's fair. All right, you're in.

(to Ragetti)
I don't need you.

(to Gibbs)
Gibbs, you get another chance. Marty.
Cotton, all right. And Cotton's
Parrot, I'ma little iffy, but all
right, you're a team --

Jack comes to Tai Huang.

JACK (CONT'D)
And you are?

HUANG
Tai Huang. These are my men.

JACK
Where do your allegiances lie?

HUANG
With the highest bidder

JACK
I have a ship.

TAI HUANG
That makes you the highest bidder.

Jack, satisfied, gestures for them to get on board.

JACK
Weigh anchor! All hands! Stand by
to make way!

He pulls out his Compass. Glances down: the needle holds
steady. Jack smiles, moves his hand -- the needle doesn't
move. No matter how he fiddles, the needle is frozen in
place

BARBOSSA (0.S.)
Ja-ack.

Jack turns. Barbossa holds up the ancient charts.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 33.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Which way you going, Jack?

562 EXT. BLACK PEARL - DECK - DAY 562

Barbossa calls out orders. Jack shadows him, and repeats the
orders a half-second behind, a little louder

BARBOSSA
Trim that sail! Slack windward brace
and sheet! Haul that pennant line!

JACK
Trim that sail! Slack windward brace
and sheet! Haul that pennant line!

BARBOSSA
What are you doing?

JACK
The Captain gives orders on a ship.

BARBOSSA
The Captain is giving orders.

JACK
My ship, that makes me Captain.

BARBOSSA
They be my charts!

PINTEL
Stow it, the both of you, and that's
an order! Understand?

Jack and Barbossa stare at Pintel, too incredulous to respond.
Pintel puts his hands up and backs away --

PINTEL (CONT'D)
Sorry! Just, with the Captain issue
in doubt and all, thought I'd throw
my name in for consideration -- sorry.

RAGETTI
I would vote for you.

Jack steps up to the rail, and ceremoniously pulls out a
telescope, the way a Captain would do it.

Barbossa steps up beside him. Smirks ... pulls out a MUCH
LONGER telescope. Jack stares at it, deflated.

Will steps past them, searching the deck for Elizabeth --

INT. BLACK PEARL- BELOW DECKS - DAY 563
Will looks, finds Elizabeth, sitting alone.

WILL
You left Jack to the Kraken.

She looks up. She's been crying -- but she is relieved.

ELIZABETH
He's rescued now. It's done with.

Will does not agree. Looks away. She stands --

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Will, I had no choice!

WILL
You chose not to tell me.
ELIZABETH
I couldn't. It wasn't your burden to

bear.
He catches her arm, pulls her around to face him.
WILL

But I did bear it. Didn't I? I just
didn't know what it was. I thought

ELIZABETH
You thought I loved him.

She tries to move past him. He blocks her way. She tries to
push him aside. He pushes her back, against the hull.

WILL
If you make your choices alone, how
can I trust you?
She meets his gaze.

ELIZABETH
You can't.

He looks away from her. She ducks beneath his arm and goes.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - NIGHT 564
Sailing the darkness between worlds.

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT 565

The cabin is still ripped to shreds from the encounter with
the Flying Dutchman, the Kraken. Barbossa inspects the damage.
566

567

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 35.

BARBOSSA
I see you neglected to care for my
ship.

JACK

What, this? Just ventilating. Clear
out the stench of the previous owner
you know. Thinking of putting in
French doors, actually. Feel the
cross breeze?

Gibbs sticks his head in.

GIBBS
Heading, Captain?

On the word 'Captain' both Jack and Barbossa turn.

JACK
Two degrees starboard --

BARBOSSA
I'm Captain of the starboard side!
Two degrees starboard. The Captain
will now take the helm.

GIBBS
(salutes twice)
Aye, Sirs.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - DECK - NIGHT 566

Gibbs exits, followed by Jack and Barbossa. Each of them
split to opposite stairs, Jack to port, Barbossa starboard.

They come together at the wheel, with a nervous Cotton in
between. Jack adjusts the wheel. Barbossa adjusts it back.

ON THE STERN DECK, Ragetti surreptitiously readies a fishing 567
pole. Moves to the railing, looks down. Drops the line --

IN THE WATER, a pale BODY hurries past, face up, eyes closed,
hands crossed over its chest. Ragetti lets out a cry, jumps
back. He edges back to the rail --

A STREAM of BODIES flows past underwater. Old, young, men
and women, at different depths and moving at different speeds.

Pintel has joined Ragetti, watching over the side.

PINTEL
Eerie. Downright macabre.
568

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 36.

RAGETTI
(musing)
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of ‘em.

They look at each other -- let's find out!

Pintel picks up a cannonball, turns -- Tia Dalma is there,
fixes them both with stern look. Frightened, Pintel drops
the cannon ball.

PINTEL
Be disrespectful, it would.

TIA DALMA

(looks out to sea)
They should be in the care of Davy
Jones. That was the duty he was
charged with by the goddess Calypso:
to ferry those who died at sea to
the other side. And every ten years,
he could come ashore, to be with she
who loved him truly. But he has become
a monster.

RAGETTI
He wasn't always all tentacle-y?

TIA DALMA
No, he was a man, once. Poor
unfortunate souls ... now they must
find their own way.

Ragetti nods, spots something ahead: a small boat, coming
toward them, lit by a lantern's glow.

RAGETTI
Now it's boats coming.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - FORWARD DECK - NIGHT 568

Will and Elizabeth join Tia Dalma at the rail. Far away
other boats can be seen, their own lanterns lit.

Gibbs arrives at the rail, loading a rifle, lifts it to aim --
Will stops him.

WILL
No. They are not a threat to us. Am
I right?

He looks to Tia Dalma for confirmation.
TIA DALMA

We are but ghosts to them. They heed
us not.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 37.

BARBOSSA
Best just let them be.

Gibbs lowers the rifle but keeps it ready. The boats move
past, an eerie, surreal sight. Elizabeth looks at the nearest
boat, peers closer. Recognizes the passenger

ELIZABETH
My father! We've made it back
(to Swann)

Father, here! Look here!
Jack puts a consoling hand on Elizabeth's shoulder.

JACK
Elizabeth. We're not back yet.

He looks her in the eye. Elizabeth stares at him -- and
realization dawns. Her next cry is one of anguish:

ELIZABETH
Father!

IN THE BOAT, Weatherby Swann glances over. His lantern lights
half his face, leaving the rest in shadow.

SWANN
Elizabeth!
(concern)
Are you dead?

ELIZABETH
No ...

Swann nods at that. Elizabeth has to move along the rail of
the Pearl, toward the stern, to keep pace with him.

SWANN
I think I am.

ELIZABETH
No. You can't be.

SWANN
(has trouble recalling)
There was a chest, you see ... How
odd. At the time, it seemed so
important.

ELIZABETH
Come abroad!
(to the others) )
Someone -- cast a line!
(to Swann)
Come back with us!
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 38.

Crewmen prepare a line, too slowly for Elizabeth. She grabs
it from them, casts it out. It lands neatly in Swann's boat
but he makes no move toward it.

SWANN
And a heart, and if you stabbed the
heart ... you would have to sail

forever. That's how it worked. Stab
the heart and take his place. The
Dutchman must have a Captain. Silly
thing to die for.

Will makes note of that. Jack makes note as well. Glances at
Tia Dalma. But Tia Dalma is focused only on Will. She
whispers, just loud enough for Will to hear --

TIA DALMA
A touch of destiny ...

Due to the action of the two vessels passing, the rope begins
to slip toward the edge of the boat.

ELIZABETH
Take the line!

SWANN
(suddenly; this is
important)
Elizabeth.

She gives him her full attention.

SWANN (CONT'D)
When I would reprimand you to obey
rules, it was because I did not want
you to ever be unhappy. But I should
have recognized in your willfulness
... your courage. I am proud of you
Elizabeth.

The line is about to slip from Swann's boat.

ELIZABETH
The line! Catch the line!

The end of the falls into the water

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Father!

His boat is near the aft of the Pearl.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

Come back with us! Please! I won't
let you go!

She must not leave the ship!

Elizabeth climbs the rail. Will get there slightly ahead of
Jack to haul her back.

SWANN
I'll give your love to your mother,
then, shall I?

Elizabeth stares after him. Watching, helpless.
Light of the boat's lantern is swallowed up by the darkness.

Elizabeth turns toward Will, into his arms. He confronts her
. but his eyes drift toward Tia Dalma.

WILL
Is there a way?

TIA DALMA
(shakes her head 'no')
He is at peace.

EXT. DAVY JONES LOCKER - SUNSET 569
An orange sun hovers over a dark horizon
EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - SUNSET 570

No wind. No movement. The crew lays about the deck -- parched
with thirst, no energy. Pintel tilts a water barrel over his
head, cracked lips waiting, waiting -- nothing.

PINTEL
No water. Why is all but the rum
gone?

Gibbs lets a final drop fall from a bottle to his lips --

GIBBS
Rum's gone too.

Tia Dalma and Will are at the rail. Elizabeth sits alone
withdrawn. Will watches her.

TIA DALMA
If we can not escape these doldrums
before night, I fear we will sail on
trackless seas, under starless skies,
doomed to roam the reach between
worlds ... forever.

GIBBS
With no water, forever looks to be
arriving a mite soon.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 40.

Ragetti, hand over his eye, chases the Monkey past. Jack
notices Ragetti's eye as it rolls on top of the Charts.

WILL
(re: Barbossa)
Why doesn't he do something?
(reads)
"Over the edge, back, over again,
sunrise sets, flash of green."

ON JACK: gazing at the chart, where rolls Ragetti's eye.

GIBBS (0.S.)
There's no sense to it. Sunrises
don't set.

WILL (0.S.)
And the green flash happens at sunset
not sunrise.

GIBBS (0.S.)
Over the edge ... driving me bloody
well over the edge.

They fade into the background as Jack watches Ragetti's eye,
rolling back and forth, idly plays with the rings of the
charts. Chinese characters line up to read: UP IS DOWN.

JACK
Up is down. That's maddeningly

unhelpful. Why are these things never
clear?

571 CLOSE ON: Jack's hair, a JUNGLE of GIANT DREADLOCKS, as a small
Jack-on-Jack's-shoulder pushes through.

JACK LEFT
Stab the heart.

Jack jumps, shocked and unsettled..

JACK
What?

A second small Jack is on Jack's right shoulder.

JACK RIGHT
Don't stab the heart.
JACK
Come again?
JACK RIGHT

The Dutchman must have a Captain.

571
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 41.

JACK
That's even more than less than
unhelpful.

JACK LEFT
Sail the seas for eternity.

JACK
I love the sea.

JACK LEFT
But what about port?

JACK
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

JACK LEFT
Making port.

JACK RIGHT
Where we can get rum. And salty
wenches. Once every ten years.

JACK LEFT
What did he say?

JACK
Once every ten years.

JACK LEFT
Ten years is a long time.

JACK
Even longer, given the deficit of
rum.

JACK RIGHT
And salty wenches.

JACK LEFT
But eternity is longer still.

JACK RIGHT
(to Jack)
And how will you spend it? Dead, or
not?

JACK LEFT
The immortal Captain Jack Sparrow ..

JACK
Oooh I like that.

JACK RIGHT
Come sunset, it won't matter.
572

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 42.

ON THE MAP, as Jack notices: as the drawing of the ship spins 572
upside down, RAYS OF a SUNSET are created. And Jack KNOWS --
JACK
Not sun-set. Sun-down. And rise

. up!
He stands. Points.

JACK (CONT'D)
Over there! What's that? I don't
know! What do you think?

GIBBS
Where?

Jack moves over to the railing at port. Everyone follows ...
the ship tilts that way a little. Jack turns, suddenly races
to the starboard side.

JACK
There, it moved! Suddenly. It's very
fast.

Everyone follows -- what is he up to? The ship tilts that
way some; the eyeball rolls. Elizabeth can't help but notice
the activity.

Jack suddenly seems to see something on back the port side --

JACK (CONT'D)
Thar! Over thar

He runs to port. Elizabeth follows everyone else to the rail.
The ship rocks back.

ELIZABETH
What is it?

JACK
It's not here!

He runs across again, everyone follows, and the ship tilts
more. Barbossa approaches the map -- sees UP IS DOWN, the
upside down ship, the sunset. Picks up the rolling eye.

A glare at Ragetti -- and Barbossa hands back the eye, goes
back to studying the chart.

PINTEL
He's rocking the ship.

GIBBS
(running past)
We're rocking the ship!
573

574

575

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 43.

And, suddenly, Barbossa gets it:
BARBOSSA
Aye, he's onto it. All hands together
Time it with the swell!
Barbossa moves to the hold --
INT. BLACK PEARL - BELOW DECKS - CARGO HOLD - SUNSET
BARBOSSA
Loose the cannon! Unstow the cargo!
Let it shift!
Cargo is cut loose; crates, bottles, barrels roll --
EXT. BLACK PEARL - SUNSET
Cotton spins the wheel --

FROM ABOVE, the ship turns sideways to the swell. The ship
tilts over. Pintel suddenly figure it out --

PINTEL
He's rocking the ship!

Ragetti already has a rope ready.

RAGETTI
We tie each other to the mast, upside
down, so we'll be right side up when
the boat flips!

Pintel thinks about it. Thinks about it. Thinks about it --
Will gets to the rail as the ship tilts near horizontal,
looks out. The sun SINKS into the sea, a small orange flame
left -- the Black Pearl tilts the other way --

JACK
And now up, is down!

The Black Pearl rocks completely over into the water. Waves
fill the sails and cause the ship to continue to roll --

CAMERA MOVES AROUND THE ROLLING SHIP, PAST THE SURFACE --
UNDERWATER, chains, cannons, small objects fall down toward
the depths. Jack, Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa hold on. Gibbs
loses his grip, floats past -- Marty grabs him. Pintel and
Ragetti, tied to the mast, look at each other, hold their
breaths, cheeks bulging.

Underwater, the Charts float past -- Will grabs them --

-- CAMERA SPINS, SO THE BLACK PEARL IS RIGHT SIDE UP --

573

574

575
576

577

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 44.
ON THE HORIZON, the FLASH OF GREEN shoots up! 576
AND SUDDENLY --
THWUMP !
EXT. BLACK PEARL - SUNRISE 577
All of the water FALLS with a giant SPLASH. The objects fall,
people fall, the parrot falls, SLAMMING onto the deck. The
water washes away, and the Black Pearl bobs on the sea.

Gibbs still holds his breath, unsure, turning red ... finally
has to let it out. Takes a deep breath --

GIBBS
Blessed sweet Westerlies! We're back

He wets his finger, lifts it.

Jack opens his fist, forces himself to look -- no black spot.
Pintel and Ragetti hang upside down, tied to the mast.

PINTEL
This was your idea, and the fact
that I went along does not make you
any less stupid.

RAGETTI
Well it don't make you no more smart,
neither.

PINTEL

Yes it does, my lack of instigating
stupid ideas makes me smarter by
omission.

Next to Pintel's head, Cotton's parrot shakes off water and
ruffles its feathers. Elizabeth gazes at the horizon.

ELIZABETH
It's a sunrise.

Will looks out and sees the sun rising above the water. A
brief moment of celebration as everyone grins at each other --

Then EVERYBODY instantly draws their pistols at once, and
points them at each other --

Will at Barbossa. Barbossa at Jack. Gibbs at Barbossa.
Elizabeth at Jack.

Jack at Will, draws a second pistol, at Barbossa. Barbossa
draws a second pistol, at Gibbs. Elizabeth picks up a second
pistol, points it at Barbossa.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 45.
It's a moment everyone has been preparing for. A beat --
And then EVERYBODY LAUGHS. They can't help but grin, lower

their pistols. Suddenly the LAUGHTER STOPS and the pistols
are raised again. Pintel and Ragetti work to get free.

PINTEL
Get untied, we need our pistols!
Hurry!

RAGETTI

Who would we point at?

BARBOSSA
All right, then. The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.
Jack, you and I be going there, and
there's no arguing the point.

JACK
I is arguing the point. If there's
pirates a-gathering, I'm a-pointing
my ship the other a-way.

ELIZABETH
The pirates are gathering to fight
Beckett. And you're a pirate.

She swings her second pistol toward Jack. Jack stops aiming
at Will, aims at her. Will aims at Jack, draws a second pistol
to cover Barbossa.

WILL
Fight or not, you're not running.

BARBOSSA
If we don't stand together, they'll
hunt us down, one by one, 'til there's
none left but you.

JACK
Then I’1l be the last pirate. At
least then there will be only one of
me.

 

BARBOSSA
Aye, and you'll be fighting Jones
alone. How does that figure into
your plans?

JACK
Still working on it. But I'm not
going back to the Locker, Barbossa.
Count on that.
578

579

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 46.

Jack fires his pistol -- 'click.' Barbossa and Will and
Elizabeth fire -- more 'clicks.' Pintel and Ragetti arrive
with their pistols as the others check their own.
GIBBS
Wet powder.
WILL

We've other issues to deal with. We
can get back to shooting each other
later.

They move away. Pintel and Ragetti test their own pistols --
click.

PINTEL
Wait. We can still use 'em as clubs!

He demonstrates, using the pistol to hammer the air. Ragetti
does the same -- but actually hits Pintel.

RAGETTI
Sorry.
(regards pistol-club)
Effective, though.

EXT. BLACK PEARL 578
CLOSE ON: THE CHARTS
Will indicates on the chart to Jack and Barbossa.
WILL
There's a fresh water spring on this
island, where we can resupply.
JACK

You lead the shore party. I'll stay
with the ship.

BARBOSSA
I'll not be leaving my ship in your
command.

WILL

And he'll not be leaving his ship in
your command, and here's an an idea.
You both go, and leave the ship in
my command.

(off their looks)
Temporarily. Promise.

AT THE RAIL 579

Barbossa steps up, pulls out his telescope. Jack arrives
next to him.
580

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 47.

BARBOSSA
An uneasy alliance?

Barbossa opens his scope, looks through.

JACK
An unholy one.

Jack opens his own telescope, until it is long as Barbossa's

. then opens it further, until it is much longer. It droops
at the end. Barbossa looks at him. He smiles. Barbossa snaps
his telescope closed.

EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY 580

Pintel and Ragetti crawl out of the surf as the other boats
land. Jack and Barbossa step onto the sand, spot something.
The rest of the pirates see it, too.

PINTEL
Criminey!

Jack and Barbossa walk toward it. Pintel and Ragetti hustle
past them toward --

The KRAKEN. It lies dead on the shore. Pintel finds a
driftwood stick, pokes it.

RAGETTI
Careful!

PINTEL
Ahh, not so tough now, are you? Stupid
fish! Serves you right!

Jack approaches the Kraken almost reverently.

RAGETTI
Hello! I bet folk would pay a shilling
to see this! And a second shilling
for a sketch of 'em sitting atop!

PINTEL
Kraken slayers! We could carve
mini'ture Krakens out of coconut and
sell those, too! We could give 'ema
slice as a souvenir.

RAGETTI
Or fried! For lunch.

PINTEL
I wonder which of the parts is edible?

Jack stares into the huge eye of the beast, his image
reflected back. Barbossa appears behind him.
581

582

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 48.

BARBOSSA
Still thinking of running, Jack?
Think you can outrun the world? The
problem of being the last of anything:
by and by, there be none left at
all.

JACK
Sometimes things come back. We're
living proof, mate.

BARBOSSA
Aye, but that's a gamble with long
odds, ain't it? There's no guarantee
of coming back. But passing on --
that's dead certain.

Jack contemplates that one. Barbossa regards the beast.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
The world used to be a bigger place.

JACK
It's still the same size. There's
just less in it.
(reluctant)
Summoning the Brethren Court, is it?

BARBOSSA
Our only hope.

JACK
That's sad commentary, in and of
itself.
INT. BLACK SAND BEACH - WELL - DAY 581
Marty stoops to drink -- jumps back with a shout. A BODY
lies dead in the water, face down. Barbossa samples a handful
of water, spits it out.

BARBOSSA
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

The body is turned over -- Steng, the betrayer in Singapore.
The wooden fid has been driven through his eye.

PINTEL
Hey, I know him!

There's a SHOUT from outside --
EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY 582

They rush outside. Ragetti yells something, but words are
lost. He points --
583

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 49.

OUT PAST THE REEF floats the Black Pearl -- and next to it,
a Chinese fighting ship, the EMPRESS.

Jack and Barbossa stare. There is a loud CLICK! Their eyes
go sideways to find -- Tai Huang holds a pistol on them,
backed by his men.

JACK
(points)
He's the Captain.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - LATER 583

The landing party climbs on deck. CHINESE PIRATES -- too
many to fight -- have taken over the Pearl. They've stripped
the crew of their weapons, shackled them together

Elizabeth is held by TWO GUARDS. One of them rubs a swelling
eye, the other has a bloody lip.

Jack and Barbossa spot Sao Feng at the same time. Jack
recognizes him, and tries to be inconspicuous behind Barbossa.

BARBOSSA
Sao Feng. You showing up here, 'tis
truly a remarkable coincidence.

SAO FENG
Fortune smiles upon those prepared
to meet its gaze.
(moves toward Jack)
Jack Sparrow. You paid me great
insult, once.

He SLUGS Jack in the jaw. Jack staggers, his knees buckle --
but he keeps his feet. Holds up a hand to Sao Feng to wait,
searches for his hat. Finds, sets it back on his head.

JACK
So now we can call it square.
SAO FENG
Hardly.
Will strides up -- he spots Elizabeth in chains --
WILL
She's not part of the bargain. Release
her.
BARBOSSA

And what bargain be that?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 50.

SAO FENG
(to his men)
You heard Captain Turner. Release
her.

JACK
Captain Turner?

GIBBS
Aye, the perfidious rotter leda
mutiny against us.

JACK
It's always the quiet ones.

Elizabeth, unchained now, eyes Will warily.

ELIZABETH
Why didn't you tell me you were
planning this?

WILL
It was my burden to bear.

BARBOSSA
The only way a pirate can make a
profit, these days, is by betraying
other pirates.

SAO FENG
I can live with that ... as long as
I am not the other pirates.

JACK
But you've no acrimony toward
mutineers?

SAO FENG
He did not mutiny against me, did
he?

WILL
I need the Pearl. That's the only
reason I came on this voyage.

JACK

He needs the Pearl --

(to Elizabeth)
-- and you felt guilty --

(to Barbossa)
-- and you and your Brethren Court

. Didn't anyone come to save me

just because they missed me?

Gibbs, Marty and Cotton raise their hands -- Pintel and
Ragetti see, and follow their lead.
584

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 51.

JACK (CONT'D)
(points)
I'm standing over there with them.

Sao Feng grabs his arm.

SAO FENG
I'm sorry, Jack, but there's an old
friend who wants to see you first.

JACK
I'm not certain I can survive any
more visits from old friends.

SAO FENG
Here is our chance to find out.

He nods his head toward a spot over Jack's shoulder --

Rounding the island is the ENDEAVOUR. Jack is yanked roughly
away by Sao Feng's men.

INT. ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY 584

Jack has been escorted into the room. Beckett signals his
guards to leave without turning. He stands at the window,
peering out at the Black Pearl. Jack's effects are on the
table -- including the Compass. So is a decanter and two
glasses of Sherry. Jack searches the room surreptitiously
under the following:

BECKETT
Remarkable. The last I saw of that
ship, she was on fire, a blackened
hulk sinking beneath the waves.

JACK
Thank you for that memory.

BECKETT
We had a deal. I contracted you to
deliver cargo on my behalf. You chose
to liberate it.

Jack glances toward his right wrist.

JACK
People aren't cargo, mate.

BECKETT
And you incurred a heavy debt to
raise her back up, didn't you? It's
not here, Jack.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 52.
He turns. Jack assumes an air of questioning innocence.

JACK
What is not?

BECKETT
The heart of Davy Jones. Is safely
aboard the Flying Dutchman, and so
unavailable for use as leverage to
satisfy your debt to the good captain.

Jack clocks that.

JACK
By my reckoning, that account's been
settled.

BECKETT
By your death. And, yet, here you
are.

JACK
Close your eyes and pretend it's all
a bad dream. That's how I get by.

Beckett's control lapses momentarily; he says something he's
wanted to say for a long time.

BECKETT
Your good deed cost me much, Jack!

JACK
And you spared me any possibility of
ending up as anything other than
what I am. And for that, I thank
you.

He picks up a couple of the model ships from the table,
pretends to "sail" them.

JACK (CONT'D)
Will someone be in soon to draw you
a bath?

Beckett takes them from Jack, puts them back in their places.

BECKETT
It would be nice if all of us could
be on holiday year ‘round, but someone
must ensure that the world turns
properly.
(looking over his
"world")
People are what they love, Jack, and
what they love is cargo.
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 53.

BECKETT (CONT'D)
They love spices, and linens, silks
plantains ... and as long as it
arrives on time and in sufficient
supply, they are content to be nothing
more than figures in a ledger. You're
a smart man; you know I'm right.

JACK
If you're offering me a seat on the
board, I am neither depraved enough
nor drunk enough to accept.

Beckett hands one of the GLASSES of sherry to Jack, who's a
bit surprised. Beckett toasts him.

BECKETT
Then perhaps you'll consider a
different arrangement. One that
requires nothing from you but
information.

Jack has spotted the Pieces of Eight on Beckett's desk.

JACK
Regarding the Brethren Court, no
doubt. In exchange for fair
compensation? Square my debt with
Jones, guarantee my freedom?

BECKETT
Of course. It's just good business.

JACK
Were I in a divulgatory mood, what
might I divulge?

BECKETT
Everything. Where are they meeting?
Who are the Pirate Lords? What is
the purpose of the nine pieces of
eight?

JACK
I think I'd prefer to maintain my
monopoly on those answers. It's just
good business.

BECKETT
You haven't changed. Enjoy the
gallows.

JACK

I've been. Once you've taken in the
view, there's not much else to it.
(MORE )
585

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 54.

JACK (CONT'D)
Now, far be it for me to give advice
to you, but if I were me and you
were you and we each had the same
lack of trust in the other, imagine
you are me. You would propose that
rather than you telling me where the
Brethren Court is meeting, you lead
me there instead, whereupon you could
serve up to me the Pirate Lords, the
Nine Pieces of Eight, and the whole
of the Brethren Court on a silver
platter. And you being me, I would
likely accept such an offer.

BECKETT
On a silver platter?

JACK
With a frilly linen napkin and a
spicy banana on the side.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DECK - DAY 585

Sao Feng's men guard Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth and the rest
of Barbossa's crew. They all wear shackles.

Mercer and a crew of sailors fan out on the ship. The sailors
begin preparations to sail. One tries to take the wheel from
Huang. Sao Feng and Will intercept Mercer

SAO FENG
My men are crew enough.

MERCER
Company ship, company crew.

WILL
(to Sao Feng)
You agreed, the Black Pearl was to
be mine.

SAO FENG
And so it was.

Sao Feng gestures. One of his men punches Will from behind
in the kidneys, knocking the wind of out of him. Two others
shackle his arms.

Will is hauled away. Sao Feng turns to Mercer.
SAO FENG (CONT'D)

Beckett agreed, the Black Pearl was
to be mine.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 55.

MERCER
And so it was.
(smiles)
Lord Beckett wouldn't give up the
one ship as might prove a match for
the Dutchman, would he?

Sao Feng looks around. The sailors outnumber his men, and
all are armed, watching for trouble. Sao Feng nods sharply
to his man at the wheel -- he steps aside for the sailor

Mercer gives Sao Feng a half-salute and ambles away. Barbossa
sidles up next to Sao Feng.

BARBOSSA
Shame they're not bound to honor the
Code of the Brethren. Isn't it? Of
course, honor's a hard thing to come
by, nowadays.

SAO FENG
There is no honor to remaining with
the losing side. Leaving it for the
winning side ... that's just good
business.

BARBOSSA
The losing side, says you.

SAO FENG
They have the Dutchman. And what do
the Brethren have?

He sees Sao Feng is considering his words. He leans close.

BARBOSSA
We have ... Calypso.
Soa Feng is surprised; unbidden, his eyes cut toward Elizabeth --
Barbossa clocks it -- then Sao Feng adopts a skeptical mein.
SAO FENG
Calypso. An old legend.
BARBOSSA
No, the goddess herself, bound in
human form ... fury or favor, you
not be knowing ... but when the mood
strikes her, and its her favor she
bestows upon a lucky sailor ... well,

you've heard: legendary.

Barbossa and Sao Feng exchange knowing smirks.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 56.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
There was a time when the seas be
untamed, the world a rougher place,
and a sailor made his own fate.
(beat)
I aim to bring it back. And for that,
I need the Brethren Court.

Barbossa taps the knot pendant Sao Feng wears.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
All the court.

SAO FENG
What are you proposing?

BARBOSSA
What be you accepting?

SAO FENG
The girl.

ELIZABETH
What?

WILL

We give you Elizabeth in exchange
for helping us escape?

Sao Feng nods -- it seems a reasonable price to him.

BARBOSSA
No. No. Out of the question.

SAO FENG
It was not a question.

Elizabeth has been thinking it through.

ELIZABETH
Done.
WILL
What?
(to Sao Feng)
Not done.
ELIZABETH

You've put us in these straits. If
this frees us, then ...

(again, to Sao Feng)
Done.

WILL
No.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 57.

ELIZABETH
My choice. My choice alone.

WILL
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

ELIZABETH
I've had more than enough experience
dealing with pirates.

She says it pointedly, imply she's had more than enough of
dealing with one pirate in particular: him.

SAO FENG
I am pleased --

He reaches out to take her arm, but she yanks it out of his
grasp, holds up a warning finger: ah-ah

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
My apologies. I know I must earn
your favor.

Elizabeth is a bit surprised by his respect, but she's willing

to take it.
ELIZABETH
That's right. You do.
BARBOSSA
Then we have an accord?
SAO FENG
Agreed.
They shake.
GIBBS
Now if we only had a plan.
586 INT. ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY 586

JACK
You can keep Barbossa. The belligerent
homunculus and his friend with the
wooden eye, both. And Turner.
Especially Turner. If he were twins
you could have all three of ‘em.

Beckett notes that, suspicion behind his eyes.

BECKETT
And what becomes of Miss Swann?

JACK
What interest is she to you?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 58.

Beckett gives Jack a knowing smile.

JACK (CONT'D)
The rest go with me aboard the Pearl,
and I will lead you to Shipwreck
Cove. A fair deal, don't you think?

Jack extends his hand. Beckett smiles at it.

BECKETT
Jack, I just recalled: I have this
wonderful Compass that points to
whatever I want. So for what do I
need you?

JACK
Points to the thing you want most
And that's not the Brethren Court

is it?
BECKETT
No? Then what is, Jack?
JACK
Me.
(long beat)
Dead.

He gestures to the compass: try it. Beckett opens the compass.
From his reaction, it points to Jack. Jack scuttles sideways.
From Beckett's reaction, the needle follows him.

BECKETT
Damn.

He flings the compass to Jack. Then realizes:

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Although, it occurs: if I got what I
wanted most, then wouldn't what I
wanted second most become the thing
I wanted most? If I killed you, I

can find ... Shipwreck Cove, was it?
On my own. Cut out the middleman, as
it were ... literally.

JACK

With me killed, then you'll arrive

at the Cove, find it's a stronghold,
nigh impregnable, able to withstand
blockade for years, and you'll be
wishing, oh, if only there was someone
who you had not killed inside to
ensure that the pirates come outside.
587

588

589

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 59.

BECKETT
And you can accomplish this?

JACK
You may kill me, but you may never
insult me. Who am I?
(beat)
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, mate. Do
we have an accord?

He nods, indicating his still-extended hand. Beckett hesitates --

THE SHIP IS ROCKED BY CANNON FIRE. Beckett falls forward.
Jack grabs his hand, shakes it --

JACK (CONT'D)
Done!

-- scoops up his effects and heads for the door

EXT. ENDEAVOUR - MAIN DECK - DAY 587
Jack appears on deck, Beckett trailing. BODIES are littered,

the aftermath of fighting. Beckett looks out -- the Empress

sails off, already distant. CANNON FIRE and GUNSHOTS from

the Black Pearl --

ON THE BLACK PEARL, the last of Beckett's men are cut down. Mercer 588
is driven back, somersaults off the stern --

-- SPLASHES into the water.
ON THE ENDEAVOUR - Jack stares at the Pearl. Searches for a way 589

across. He shoves a GUNNER away from a cannon, kicks away the
brace, flips the cannon over, facing into the ship.

Beckett turns, looks -- Jack wraps a rope around the cannon
wheel, a burning fuse lighter in hand.
BECKETT
You're mad.
JACK

Oh thank goodness. Because if I am
in fact not living some wretched
fever dream, I doubt this will work.

Jack lights the cannon -- Beckett dives out of the way as it
FIRES -- the ball hits the mast behind him, cracking it. The
RECOIL shoves the cannon violently back; it SMASHES through
the rail -- and PLUMMETS --

Jack hangs on as the rope pulls him upwards and out, flying
across --

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DECK - DAY 590

Barbossa follow's Jack's trajectory. Winces at a series of
HORRIBLE CRASHING SOUNDS. Pushes forward, sees:

A ripped sail. Splintered barrel. Tangled rope. Spilled tar
and scattered gunpowder. The aftermath of what had to be a
terrible landing. PAN UP TO REVEAL:

Jack Sparrow, standing on the aft railing, unhurt, ina
relaxed pose. He smiles.

JACK
Tell me you didn't miss me.

Barbossa turns away in disgust. Jack hops down, comes face-
to-face with Will.

JACK (CONT'D)
Send this piss-yellow traitor to the
brig.

Will is dragged away --

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, OFFICER GROVES steps up to Beckett. 591
GROVES
Which ship do we follow?
BECKETT
Signal the Dutchman. We follow the
Pearl -- how soon can we have the

ship ready to pursue?

Behind them, the broken mast cracks and FALLS, the sails
plummeting. Groves stares off at the Pearl in open admiration.

GROVES
Do you think he plans it all out, or
just makes it up as he goes along?
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING 592

A spectacular storm front on the horizon. The Chinese junk
EMPRESS sails to avoid it --

INT. EMPRESS - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT 593

Hanging silks and pillows, lit by candlelight, attended by
three Chinese MAIDENS. Elizabeth turns as Sao Feng enters.

He stares in open admiration. She is stunning in a traditional
Chinese gown. Final adjustments are made by the Maidens.

He recites a verse of the poem To Zhang's Dancing:
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 61.

SAO FENG
Young willow shoots. Touching,
brushing, the water. Of the garden
pool.

Sao Feng dismisses the Maidens. He offers her wine.
ELIZABETH

I admit, this is not how I expected
to be treated.

SAO FENG
No other treatment would be worthy
of you ... Calypso.

Elizabeth freezes with the glass at her lips.

ELIZABETH
Excuse me?

SAO FENG
Not the name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have ...
but it is what we call you.

ELIZABETH
We being who?

SAO FENG
Whom.

ELIZABETH
Who.

Sao Feng considers it, shrugs.

SAO FENG
We of the Brethren Court and our
predecessors, who concealed you in
this form. Your forgiveness. I lied.
Who imprisoned you -- oh. "Who." You
were right.

ELIZABETH
Goddess.

SAO FENG
You confirm it?

ELIZABETH
Confirm what? You've told me nothing.

SAO FENG
The Brethren Court -- not I, the
first Brethren Court, who ... whom

SAO FENG (CONT'D)

. whose decision I would have
opposed ... they bound you in human
form, so that rule of the seas would
belong to men, and not

ELIZABETH
Me.

SAO FENG
But one such as you should never be
anything less than what you are.

ELIZABETH
Pretty speech from a captor. But
words whispered through prison bars
lose their charm.

SAO FENG
Can I be blamed for my efforts? All
men are drawn to the sea. Perilous
though it may be.

ELIZABETH
Some men offer desire as justification
for their crimes.

SAO FENG
I offer simply my desire.

ELIZABETH
An item of such small value. And in
return?

SAO FENG
I would have your gifts, should you
choose to give them.

ELIZABETH
And if I choose not?

SAO FENG
Then I will take your fury.

He leans in -- kisses her. She pushes him back

In the distance, there is a muffled distant explosion --
incoming projectile -- a sudden CRASH. Outside, there are
shouts and screams, cannon fire and pistol shots. Elizabeth
ducks down as lead balls slam into the hull --

Elizabeth glances through the porthole -- smoke and flashes
of explosion, she only make out the ship is under attack

A second cannon ball hits blasts through the hull.
594

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 63.

Sao Feng lies on the deck, bloody, a long sharp shard of
wood buried in his chest.

ELIZABETH
Sao Feng?

SAO FENG
Here. Please.

Sao Feng removes the rope knot pendant he wears.

SAO FENG (CONT'D)
The Captain's Knot. Take it.
(she hesitates)
So you'll be free! Take it! I must
pass it on to the next Brethren Lord.

ELIZABETH
Me?

SAO FENG
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

She takes the pendant. Tai Huang bursts through the door
Sounds of fighting follow him into the cabin --

TAI HUANG
Captain! The ship is taken! We cannot --

He pulls up short, takes in the scene. Sao Feng, mortally
wounded, bleeding, whispers something low to Elizabeth, who
listens intently.

SAO FENG
Calypso ...

He dies in Elizabeth's arms.

TAI HUANG
What did he tell you?

She holds up the pendant, now hanging around her neck

ELIZABETH
He made me Captain.
EXT. EMPRESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT 594
Elizabeth steps onto the deck -- littered with bodies, cannon

smoke hanging in the air. Sails ripped to shreds. Moans from
injured sailors. Huang follows behind her.

-- the Flying Dutchman, with its contingent of encrusted
crewmen. Elizabeth watches as they continue to swarm onto
the ship, round up terrified sailors. Smoke on deck parts --
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 64.

And there is Commodore Norrington, striding forward, surveying

the damage. He lifts his eyes -- and sees Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH
James?
NORRINGTON
Elizabeth!

He embraces her. She endures it.

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
I heard you were dead!

ELIZABETH
And I mourned you.

He self-consciously straightens his uniform jacket.
NORRINGTON
Your father will be overjoyed to
know you are well.

ELIZABETH
My father is dead.

NORRINGTON
No, he's not. He returned to England.

ELIZABETH
Lord Beckett told you that?

NORRINGTON
PALES

Davy Jones steps past them, questions a line up of sailors.

DAVY JONES
Who among you do you name as Captain?

Huang points quickly at Elizabeth --

HUANG
Captain! Her!

Other sailors quickly chime in, point. Norrington looks at
Elizabeth, surprised.

NORRINGTON
Tow the ship. Take the sailors to
the brig.

DAVY JONES

You heard the Admiral!
595

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 65.

NORRINGTON
The Captain may have my quarters.

ELIZABETH
No thank you, sir. I prefer to remain
with my crew.

She moves to follow her crew, being led away.

NORRINGTON
Elizabeth, I swear -- I did not know.
ELIZABETH
Know what? Which side you chose? Now
you do.
INT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - BRIG - NIGHT 595

Crew members of the Empress are locked in various cells.
JIMMY LEGS closes the bar on Elizabeth, alone. A thought
hits her -- she asks tentatively:

ELIZABETH
Bootstrap?

Jimmy Legs just laughs, and moves away. He passes Clacker
who mops the deck. Elizabeth calls to him, softly:

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Bootstrap? Bill Turner?

Clacker grunts and turns his back. Elizabeth gives up, slumps
down in the cell. Next to her, EYES in the ship's hull OPEN.

BOOTSTRAP
You know my name.

Elizabeth jumps. Looks. She is not alone. BOOTSTRAP BILL is
there. A barely human form, seemingly part of the ship.

ELIZABETH
I know your son. Will Turner.

BOOTSTRAP
William! He's all right?
(she nods)
He made it! He's alive. Hah! And now
he's sent you to tell me that he's
coming to get me. He promised. God's
wounds, he's on his way!

ELIZABETH
Yes. Will is alive, and -- he wants
to help you.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 66.

There is hope in his eyes -- then a thought suddenly hits.

Hope vanishes. Despair clouds his features.

BOOTSTRAP
No. He can't come. He won't come.

ELIZABETH
I don't know how, but he will try, I
am sure. You're ... his father

Bootstraps looks slyly at her

BOOTSTRAP
I know you. He spoke of you.
Elizabeth.

ELIZABETH
Yes.

BOOTSTRAP
He can't save me. He won't. Because
of you.

ELIZABETH
Me?

BOOTSTRAP

You're Elizabeth.

Bootstrap falls silent. Elizabeth waits, then prompts him.

 

ELIZABETH
Yes. I'm Elizabeth.
BOOTSTRAP
If Jones be slain ... he who slays

him takes his place. Captain. Forever
Every man before the mast knows that,
Elizabeth! The Dutchman must have a
Captain.

Elizabeth puts it together.

ELIZABETH
I see --
BOOTSTRAP
If he saves me ... he loses you.
ELIZABETH
Yes.
BOOTSTRAP

He won't pick me. I wouldn't pick
me. The Dutchman must have a Captain.
596

597

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 67.

ELIZABETH
You said that.

Bootstrap nods, slowly fades back into the ship.

BOOTSTRAP
Tell him -- don't come! Tell him --
stay away! Can you tell him? It's
too late. I'm part of the ship. The
crew.

Bootstrap's eyes close, he becomes utterly still. Elizabeth
reaches out a hand to comfort him. Suddenly his eyes open.

BOOTSTRAP (CONT'D)
You know my name.
(Elizabeth frowns)
You know my name!

ELIZABETH
Yes. I know your son.

BOOTSTRAP
William! He's alive?

Bootstrap stares, waiting for the answer. Elizabeth nods.
BOOTSTRAP (CONT'D)
He'll come for me. He promised. You'll
see.

Bootstrap fades back into the hull. Elizabeth regards him
with horror ... and pity.

EXT. ENDEAVOUR - COMMAND DECK - DAY 596

Lieutenant Greitzer scans the horizon with a spyglass. Beckett
looks the opposite direction, out to sea.

ON THE HORIZON, a blur of movement. The faint, raucous CRY
of birds can be heard. Beckett is thoughtful.

BECKETT
Glass.

THROUGH THE SPYGLASS, a spinning TOWER of SEAGULLS rises
over some floating object --

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY 597
Gulls circle, filling the sky. Their cries much LOUDER.

IN THE WATER, a dead BODY. Bloated and pale. It is one of

Beckett's men, killed in the Black Pearl's escape, lashed to

two barrels. A SEAGULL pecks at the man's ear, flies away
with the prize, pursued by others --
598

599

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 68.
EXT. ENDEAVOUR - COMMAND DECK - DAY 598

The body is hauled onto the deck. Beckett removes a rum bottle --
with a note inside. He fishes the paper out, unrolls it --
on it is the SYMBOL of the East India Trading Company.

Greitzer spots something.

GREITZER
Sir.

Beckett looks up. On the edge of the horizon, faint and nearly
out of sight -- another whirling TOWER OF SEAGULLS.

BECKETT
Like bread crumbs. Ghastly.
(re: the note)
And we are meant to follow.

GREITZER

A betrayer among them? Or a trap?
BECKETT

A gambit. By a skilled opponent.

(smiles)
Adjust course, Lieutenant.

Greitzer is surprised, but nods.

BECKETT (CONT'D)
We can only hope to reach our

destination ... before they run out
of bodies.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - FORECASTLE - NIGHT 599

Will ties a body to a barrel. He's working almost
automatically. He uses his knife to cut a rope -- pauses.
Gazes at it. The anguish is apparent.

JACK (0.S.)
You escaped the brig even quicker
than I expected.

Will whirls, ready for attackers --

Jack lounges on the rail above the forecastle. How long has
he been there?

JACK (CONT'D)
Hold on, William. Do you notice
anything? Or, rather, do you not
notice anything? Or, rather, do you
notice something that is not there
to be noticed?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 69.

WILL
You haven't raised an alarm.

JACK
That's odd, isn't it?

He drops down to the forecastle, looks over Will's handiwork

JACK (CONT'D)
But not so odd as this. You came up
with this all on your lonesome?

WILL
I said to myself, think like Jack.

JACK
And this is what you arrived at?
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as
to win his trust and accomplish your
own ends? It's like you don't know
me at all.

WILL
Think like Jack, but do what's right.

JACK
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about your plan?
Will returns to his work without answering.

JACK (CONT'D)
Ah. You've not seen fit to trust her

with it.

WILL
I'm losing her, Jack. Every step I
make for my father ... is a step

away from Elizabeth.

JACK
If you choose to lock your heart
away, you will lose her for certain.
But if I might offer an exceedingly
simple solution: Don't save your

father.

WILL
I have to. I can't turn my back on
him.

JACK

"Can't" is a matter of fact.
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 70.

JACK (CONT'D)
You can if you want, but you won't --
and that makes it a choice.

Will considers his words, unable to disagree.

JACK (CONT'D)
That's what life is, boyo: choices.
Out of all the things you can do,
what will you do?

Will is now at a loss ... slumps. Just where Jack wanted

him:

JACK (CONT'D)
If I might lend a machete to your
intellectual thicket: Avoid the choice
altogether. Change the facts. Let
someone else dispatch Jones.

WILL
Who?
(Jack indicates: "me")
You?
JACK

Death has a way of reshuffling one's
priorities. I slip aboard the
Dutchman, I find the heart and stab
the beating thing. Your father goes
free from his debt, and you are free
to be with your charming murderess.

WILL
And you bind yourself to the Dutchman --
forever.

JACK

No, I am free forever. Free to sail
the seas, beyond the edges of he
map, free from death itself. Crew
aboard the Dutchman is one thing
but Captain? Sign me up.

WILL
You have to do the job. You have to
ferry souls to the next world or end
up just like Jones.

Jack considers what that might be like, puppeteering his
beard braids like tentacles. Shudders.

JACK
I don't have the face for tentacles.

JACK (CONT'D)
Then I'll take on the obligation and

not quite be completely free ... but
immortal has to count for something.
Now, here.

He hands Will his compass.

WILL
What's this for?

JACK
Think like me. It'll come to you.

Will puzzles -- then realizes exactly what Jack is going to
do just a half-a-second too late -- and Jack SHOVES HIM OVER
THE SIDE.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - NIGHT 600
Will hits the water. He surfaces. The BARREL (with body)
SPLASHES down beside him, narrowly missing him. Will hauls
himself atop.
JACK
(leans out)
Give my regards to Davy Jones!
He smile broadly, waves, disappears.

WILL
I hate him.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - NIGHT 601

Amid calm seas, the Empress is towed by the Dutchman. Other
ships in the group are dark outlines against the sky.

EXT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - BRIG - NIGHT 602

Elizabeth's eyes open at the sound of her jail door opening.
Norrington is there.

NORRINGTON
Be quiet. This way. Hurry.

Sao Feng's crew members look to Elizabeth. She nods, and
they move past.

ELIZABETH
What are you doing?

NORRINGTON
Choosing a side.
603

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 72.

She follows him. The cell door hangs open. Bootstrap Bill
appears, staring at the open. He pushes it open further ...
shuffles through.

EXT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - STERN BALCONY - NIGHT 603

Norrington leads Elizabeth and her crew to the tow rope.
Like rats on a line, crew members crawl across to the Empress.

NORRINGTON
One at a time. Quickly now.
(to Elizabeth)
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.
I fear there is a traitor among them.

ELIZABETH
It is too late to earn my forgiveness.

NORRINGTON
I do not ask it. I had nothing to do
with your father's death. But that
does not absolve me of my other sins.

Elizabeth looks at him -- and finally believes him.

ELIZABETH
Come with us.

Norrington wants to come.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
James. Come with me.

Norrington really wants to. Nearly all of the Chinese crew
members are across. Elizabeth implores him. Then there is a
sound from the deck -- a FIGURE shuffles toward them.

BOOTSTRAP (0.S.)
Who goes there?

The moment is broken. A lingering look -- and then Norrington
draws his sword, turns. Elizabeth stands beside him.

NORRINGTON
GO! I will follow.

ELIZABETH
You're lying.

NORRINGTON
Our destinies have been entwined
Elizabeth. But never joined.

Norrington gives in -- and kisses her. He breaks the kiss --
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 73.

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
GO! NOW!

He shoves her away. Turns. The Figure grabs a pike for a
weapon. Steps out of the dark. It is Bootstrap Bill.

NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
Back to your station, sailor.

Elizabeth, upside down, crawls along the line. Bootstrap
sees her. Something isn't right. Not quite sure what.

BOOTSTRAP
No one leaves the ship.

NORRINGTON
Stand down. That's an order

BOOTSTRAP
Part of the crew. Part of the ship.

Bootstrap stares, like he's trying to figure it all out.

NORRINGTON
Steady, man.

Something snaps in Bootstrap.
BOOTSTRAP
All hands! All hands! Prisoner escape,
all hands!
Norrington races toward Bootstrap.

NORRINGTON
Belay that!

Bootstrap shuts up. Too late. The SOUND of running FOOTSTEPS
approach. Crewmen appear --

Elizabeth, hanging upside down, is halfway across. She sees
he is in trouble.

ELIZABETH
James!

She starts back toward him --
Norrington draws his pistol, aims upwards, FIRES --

-- hitting the tow line, severing half the strands. The other
strands quickly strain and SNAP --

Elizabeth swings down and away, SPLASHES into the water, as
the EMPRESS drifts free. She hangs on, pulls hand over hand --
604

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 74.
Norrington spins back --

AND IS RUN THROUGH, stabbed by Bootstrap Bill. Norrington
cries out in pain --

NEAR THE EMPRESS, Elizabeth grabs a rope, dangles near the
hull. As the two ships part, as she disappears into darkness
she looks back in time to see --

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
NO! JAMES!

-- Norrington collapse to the deck. Bootstrap stands over
him ... doesn't understand what he has done. Crewmen appear,
crowd the deck, staring.

CLACKER
The Admiral's dead. The Admiral's
dead!

The phrase echoes through the Crewmen. Davy Jones appears --

CLACKER (CONT'D)
To the Captain's Cabin! Aye!

Crewmen race away, past Jones, past Bootstrap, knocking him
back. Bootstrap still doesn't understand. Jones leans down.

JONES
James Norrington ... do you fear
death? Do you fear judgment on the
other side?

Norrington suddenly lurches upwards, thrusting his sword
into Jones' shoulder. Jones frowns, unaffected, unhurt.
Norrington stares... then collapses, dead.

JONES (CONT'D)
I take that as a -- 'no.'

Jones pulls Norrington's sword out of his shoulder. Regards
the blade with genuine appreciation

JONES (CONT'D)
Nice sword.

He slashes it through the air --
EXT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - DECK - NIGHT 604
Crewmen rush pell-mell along the deck amid shouts of 'The

INT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT 605

Pirates crowd in and before them is a tableau: The chest is
open. Murtogg and Mullroy, trembling, and several other
SOLDIERS have their rifles pointed directly at the heart.

And behind them stands -- Mercer. Next to him is a small
cannon. The Pirates pull up short. They part as Davy Jones
enters. Jones is scared.

JONES
Close it. CLOSE IT.

Jones nods. Mercer closes the chest, locks it with a KEY on
a chain. He tilts the cannon into place -- pointed squarely
at the chest.

MERCER
Nothing has changed.

Jones watches as Mercer puts the chain around his neck.
EXT. BLACK PEARL - DECK - DAY 606
Jack and Gibbs on the aft deck. Cotton at the wheel.

GIBBS
Look alive and keep a careful eye!
Not for nothing it's called Shipwreck
Island, where lies Shipwreck Cove
and Shipwreck City!

JACK
You know, for all that pirates are
clever clogs capable of the most
underhanded and duplicitous thinking
... We are an unimaginative lot when
it comes to naming things.

GIBBS
Aye.
ON THE FORWARD DECK, Tia Dalma finds Barbossa. 607
TIA DALMA

Barbossa, why you not giving the
order to man the guns? All the
Brethren be gathered in this place.
You can force them do as you want!

BARBOSSA
What I want is not to act the fool,
and what you're suggesting is nought
but fool's folly.

Tia Dalma caresses Barbossa's cheek seductively.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 76.

TIA DALMA
If you no longer want my favor,
Barbossa, then perhaps I should be
calling a different captain to my
cause. Witty Jack would not turn
down the promise to survive the coming
storm, I think.

BARBOSSA
I do not renege on a bargain once
struck, but we agreed to ends only;
the means are mine to decide.

Tia Dalma catches his wrist. She squeezes, and his forearm
and hand become decayed, skeletal -- dead.

TIA DALMA
Caution, Barbossa. Do not forget it
was by my power you be returned from
the dead ... or what it means if you
fail me.

She moves away, but he catches her arm and pulls her close.

BARBOSSA
And don't you forget why you had to
bring me back, and why I could not
leave Jack to his well-deserved fate,
and why I could not give Sao Feng a
second smile in his throat to match
that ineffably smug one he wears on
his face. It took nine Pirate Lords
to bind you, Calypso -- and it takes
no less than nine to set you free.
'Til then, I'll not be taking commands
from you, nor risk you reaching accord
with someone else! Mr. Pintel! Mr.
Ragetti! Take this ... fishwife to
the brig!

Pintel and Ragetti hurry to comply.

PINTEL
Right this way, Missus Fish.

608 ON THE AFT DECK, the exchange has not escaped Jack. 608

Step out, Mr. Cotton.

They sail toward a distant light. The ship passes outside --

Not yours. His.

Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

Beckett is surprised by that -- just as Will intended.

JONES

WILL
(to Beckett)
You didn't tell him Jack was rescued
from the locker? Along with the Black
Pearl?
("tsk, tsk")

Jones absorbs this, turns his ire on Beckett.

JONES
What else have you kept from me?

BECKETT
There is another issue
(pointed toward will)
far more troubling.
(to Jones)
You are familiar with a person called
"Calypso"?

Jones tries for a measured response, but is not quite
successful.

JONES
Not a person. A heathen god. who
delights in cursing men with their
wildest dreams, and then revealing
them to be hollow and nought but
ash. The world is well-rid of her.

WILL
Not quite so well, actually.

The Brethren Court intends to release

No. They cannot!

We must act before they release her

I wasn't finished with that.

hammering the table top with a cannon ball.

BARBOSSA
As he who issued summons, I convene

flanked by the two biggest, nastiest-looking guys you've

ever seen: AKSHAY and PUSAN.

The Lords toss their pieces of eight into a wooden bowl which
contains a Queen of Spades: A snuff box. The neck of a bottle,
with cork still in. A pair of spectacles. Etc.

PINTEL
Those aren't pieces of eight. Those
are just pieces of junk.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 81.

GIBBS
Aye, the original plan called for
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso,
but when the first Court met, the
Brethren were to a one skint-broke.

PINTEL
So change the name.

GIBBS
What, to nine pieces of whatever we
happened to have in our pockets at
the time? Oh, yes, that sounds real
pirate-y.

BARBOSSA
(holds out his hand)
Mr. Ragetti, if you will?

RAGETTI
I kept it safe, like you said when
you gave it to me.

BARBOSSA
Aye, you have, but now I need it
back.

Ragetti hesitates. Barbossa holds his hand under Ragetti's
eye, gives him a slap on the back of his head -- the eye
falls into his hand. Barbossa drops the eye into the bowl.

MISTRESS CHING
We're missing two. By the sound of

it.
VILLANUEVA
Sparrow.
Jack reaches for the coin circlet on his headband, considers.
Barbossa takes note of the gesture -- Jack drops his hand.
JACK

We're still short one Pirate Lord.
I'm content to wait until Sao Feng
joins us.

ELIZABETH (0.S.)
Sao Feng is dead.

Elizabeth stands in the doorway, with Huang behind her. She
starts in; Huang touches her shoulder, gestures to the globe.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Before he died, he named me captain
of the Empress, and passed his
lordship onto me.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 82.
She stabs her sword into the globe.

JACK
Captain? Captain? They're just giving
the title away now.

Sumbhajee makes a small gesture to Ashay.

AKSHAY
Sri Sambhajee inquires, by whose
hand did Sao Feng perish?

JACK
Hers, I'll wager.

ELIZABETH
Will you never forgive me?
(answering the question)
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

An uproar of concern, OVERLAPPING dialogue --

CHEVALLE CHING
Le monster des The plague ship --
profondeures!

VALLENUEVA

iEchelo en infierno!
-- ending with this line, which must be clearly heard:

AMMAND
with the Dutchman against us, there
is no hope!

ELIZABETH
Listen! Listen to me! Our location
has been betrayed. Jones, under the
command of Lord Beckett -- they are
on their way here.

JOCARD
Who is this betrayer?

BARBOSSA
Not likely anyone among us.

Elizabeth realizes --

ELIZABETH
(to Jack)
Where's Will?

JACK
(shrugs)
Not among us.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 83.

BARBOSSA
And it matters not how they found
us! The question is, what will we do
now that they have?

ELIZABETH
We fight.

The other pirates laugh, dismissive.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Good men have already given their
lives to this cause!

AKSHAY
(playing to the other
pirates)
And so what matters the lives of a
few bad ones, quips Sri Sumbhajee.

More laughter.

ELIZABETH
They died in defiance of the Company.
That's my measure of good.

That silences them. Jack regards Elizabeth, calculating.

MISTRESS CHING
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress, a well-
supplied fortress. There is no need
to fight, if they cannot get to us.

Others of the Court give that consideration.

BARBOSSA
There be a third course.
(gathers them by eye)
In another age -- at this very spot! --
the first Brethren Court captured
the Sea Goddess, and bound her in
her bones. That was a mistake.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
We tamed the seas for ourselves,
aye, yet opened the door for Beckett
and his ilk. Better were the days
when mastery of seas came not through
bargains struck with eldritch
creatures, but by the sweat of a
man's brow and the strength of his
back alone. And you all know this be
true!

They do.
The pirate lords are silent

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 84.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

Gentlemen ...

AKSHAY
He has lost his senses,
declares Sri Sumbhajee!

AMMAND
She is a barathrum!

No good can come of this!

VILLANUEVA JOCARD
Ella es nuestra diosa! Don't let him speak any
further!
AMMAND
Shoot him!
JOCARD

Cut out his tongue!

JACK
Shoot him and then cut out his tongue!
And then shoot his tongue. And trim
that scraggly beard.

HUANG
Sao Feng would have agreed with
Barbossa.

ELIZABETH

Sao Feng's judgment in matters Calypso
shouldn't be trusted, even if he
were here.

The last is directed primarily to Huang. Huang takes her
point, steps back.

VILLANUEVA
Nonetheless, I would have agreed
with Sao Feng.

JOCARD
Calypso was our enemy then, she will
be our enemy now.

CHEVALLE
And her mood's not likely improved,
n'est pas?

Villanueva pulls out his pistol, SLAMS it on the table.
6150

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 85.

VILLANUEVA
I would still agree with Sao Feng.

CHEVALLE
You threaten me?

VILLANUEVA
I silence you!

He lifts the pistol -- but Chevalle punches him, sends him
sprawling into other pirates, the pistol FIRES --

CHING AMMAND
vézu! No! A pox upon thee!
JOCARD AKSHAY
Coward! Feathermerchant ! Sri Sumbhajee decries you
all!

-- Which initiates a pushing, shoving, yelling melee that
breaks out in a full-blown brawl --

ELIZABETH
This is madness.

JACK
This is politics.

ELIZABETH
And, meanwhile, our enemy is bearing
down upon us.

BARBOSSA
If they not be here already.

INT. BLACK PEARL - BRIG - NIGHT 6150
ON TIA DALMA'S LOCKET, open, playing its tune. She shuts it

. but the TUNE continues. She looks to the shadows beyond
the bars ...

JONES emerges, his own locket in his hand, open.

TIA DALMA
My sweet captain ... you've come for
me at last.

JONES

You were expecting me?

TIA DALMA
Long ago. It has been torture, trapped
in but this single form, condemned
to exist on land, cut off from the
sea, from all that I love ... from
you.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 86.

JONES
No. Ten years I devoted to the duty
you charged to me, ten years I looked
after those who died at sea ... and,
finally, when the time came I could
be with you again ... you weren't
there. Why weren't you there?

TIA DALMA
It is my nature. I may have been
there the next time. Would you love
me if I was anything but what I am?

JONES
I do not love you.

His words sting her.
TIA DALMA
Many things you were, Davy Jones ...
but never cruel. You have corrupted
your purpose, and so yourself
She reaches a hand out through the bars, toward his chest --

TIA DALMA (CONT'D)
... and you hid away what should
always have been mine.

She touches his chest, where his heart should be -- and he
is REVEALED now, the MAN he once was.

He reaches back through the bars, to caress her face ...

JONES
. Calypso ...
TIA DALMA
I will be free. And when I am, I
would give you my heart ... and we

would be together, always
. He traces his hand down the contours of her face ...

TIA DALMA (CONT'D)
. if only you had a heart to give.

She removes his hand from her chest; and now the hand that
was at her throat is his CLAW.

TIA DALMA (CONT'D)
Why did you come?

Jones removes his claw from her neck, pulls it back -- it
"tings" against the bars of the cell, trapped inside.
6160

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 87.

Jones concentrates, shudders -- and pushes himself THROUGH
THE BARS, into the cell with Tia Dalma

JONES
And what fate do you have planned
for your captors?

TIA DALMA
The Brethren Court, all of them, the
last thing they will learn in this
life ... is how cruel I can be.

Jones nods. He steps away from her, toward the shadows.

TIA DALMA (CONT'D)
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

He pauses. Turns his head toward her without turning from
the shadows:

JONES
My heart will always belong to you.

She smiles, opens her locket -- the TUNE resumes. Jones
vanishes into the shadows.

INT. SHIPWRECK COVE - BRETHREN COURT - NIGHT 6160

The brawl still in full force. Elizabeth sits in her chair,
head resting on her fist, exasperated. Barbossa BANGS the
cannonballs, trying to regain order, steps up on the table.

BARBOSSA
It was the first Court what imprisoned
Calypso! We shall be the ones to set
her free! And, in her gratitude, she
will see fit to grant us boons!

JACK
Or at least grant ‘em to the one of
us who summoned the rest of us and
connived all of us to set her free.

Barbossa shoots him a glare. The other pirates eye Barbossa
suspiciously.

JACK (CONT'D)
It's not impossible. Is it so
improbable?

BARBOSSA
If you have a better alternative
please, share.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 88.

JACK
Cuttlefish. Nasty little buggers.
Pen 'em up together, and they'll
devour each other without a second
thought. So, yes, we could hole up
here, well-provisioned and well-armed,
and half of us will be dead within
the month, and half of the other
half dead the month after that.

The pirate lords can't argue with that.

Aye!

JACK (CONT'D)

Or, we can release Calypso, and we
can pray she'll be in a merciful
mood. But can we pretend that she
is anything other than a woman
scorned, like which fury hell hath
no? No, we cannot. Res ipso loquitur
tabula in naufragi, we are left with
only one option. I agree with --

(gets it out)
Captain Swann: we must fight.

BARBOSSA
You've always run away from a fight!

JACK
Slander and calumny! I have only
ever embraced that oldest, noblest
of all pirate traditions. My fellow
mariners and shellbacks, I submit
that here, now, that is what we all
must do. We must fight to run away!

GIBBS JOCARD
Here, here!

MISTRESS CHING
And what be target of this fight
eh?

ELIZABETH
Lord Cutler Beckett.

CHEVALLE
Beckett is nought but a cog. Kill
him, another takes his place. Like
Jones, the East India Trading Company
is immortal. It has no body to kick
nor soul to damn.
617

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 89.

JACK
Ah, but Jones does have a body,
doesn't he? Such as it is.

JOCARD
Yes! And should we kick it hard enough
and long enough ...

AMMAND
If the Dutchman has no captain
what matters the Dutchman?

Barbossa sees the sentiment of the room beginning to sway --
he bangs the cannon ball for attention.

BARBOSSA
As per the Code ... an act of war
and this be exactly that, can only
be declared by the Pirate King.

JACK
You made that up.

BARBOSSA
Did I now? I call on Captain Teague,
Keeper of the Code!

Barbossa grins at Jack's "oh, crap, not him" expression.
Sumbhajee makes another small gesture; Ashay interprets:

AKSHAY
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims this be folly.
We are not beholden to those ancient,
outdated set of laws! Hang the Code!
Are we not free to --

A PISTOL SHOT rings out -- and Akshay stiffens, falls over. 617
Everyone looks over -- except Jack

Behind him stands CAPTAIN TEAGUE in a doorway, gunslinger
pose, smoke still rising from his pistol.

TEAGUE
The Code is the law.

Hand on the butt of a second pistol, he stares at Sumbhajee.
Sumbhajee gestures to Pusan to step into Ashay's place. Pusan
looks nervous as Sambhajee gestures again -- and then greatly
relieved.

PUSAN
Sri Sambhajee explains that a great
misunderstanding has occurred, and
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 90.
PUSAN (CONT'D)
avers that indeed the Code is the
Law.

Jack stands between Teague and the table.

TEAGUE
You're in my way, boy.
Jack turns to look at him ... then steps aside as two pirates
carry a Locked Manuscript into the room -- THE CODE.
PINTEL
(with awe, to Ragetti)
The Code!
RAGETTI

(with awe, to Pintel)
As set forth by Morgan and
Bartholomew!

Teague whistles -- and the PRISON DOG runs into the room,
key ring in his mouth. Pintel and Ragetti recognize him --

PINTEL
That can't be the same pooch, can
it?

TEAGUE

(to Pintel & Ragetti)
Sea turtles, mate.

Teague takes the key, unlocks, opens the book. Pages through,
licking his fingers.

TEAGUE (CONT'D)
(under his breath)

. compensation ... left leg, above
knee ... shooting customs agents ...
rum drinks ... ah.

Reaches a page. Reads it. Looks up.

TEAGUE (CONT'D)
Barbossa is right.

He goes to shut the book. Jack stops him, reads the passage
himself. Teague considers shooting him.

JACK
"It be the duties of the King to
declare war, parley with shared
adversaries, co-ordinate forces ...
Fancy that.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 91.

Teague retires to a chair at the back of the court, begins
strumming a mandolin.

CHEVALLE
There's not been a King since the
first court, and that's not likely

to change.
ELIZABETH
Why not?
GIBBS
See, the king is elected by popular
vote --
BARBOSSA
(smug)

-- and each pirate only ever votes
for hisself.

Jack knows he's going to put in a pin in Barbossa's balloon.

JACK
I call for a vote!

Barbossa is dismayed.
AMMAND

I vote for Ammand the Corsair

Cries of outrage from the Pirates.

JOCARD MISTRESS CHING
Not done! Outrageous! (bu xiang hua)
VILLANUEVA PUSAN

AMMAND CHEVALLE
Explain yourself, This will not stand!

JACK

Ah. Am I to understand, then, that
we will not keep to code?

SPLANG! One of Teague's mandolin strings breaks. Jack knows
Teague's got his back on this. The lords exchange glances.

MISTRESS CHING
Very well. What say you, Captain
Swann, King of the Brethren Court?

Elizabeth gaze takes in all the Pirate Lords. She stands
makes her pronouncement.

ELIZABETH
Prepare every vessel that can float.
At dawn, we are at war.

A beat, as the pirates contemplate this.

SUMBHAJEE
(high-pitched voice)
And so we shall go to war!

JOCARD
War!

The pirates rise up and vow WAR! Slap each other on the backs.
Start to exit the meeting. Barbossa glowers at Jack. Jack
smiles victoriously back

Bargossa nods to Pintel and Ragetti. Ragetti slips the bowl
behind his back, Pintel walks close behind to cover the theft --

Jack, his back turned to the proceedings, closes his eyes.
The betrayal of all time is in place.

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 93.

GIBBS
There's more beneath the waterline
here then you're letting on.

Jack opens his eyes, wide, innocent.

GIBBS (CONT'D)

You used to have a honest streak,
let a man knew where he stood with
you. But I can't figure this at all.

JACK
And where did that honest streak end
me up? Dead.

GIBBS
Jack --

JACK
Mr. Gibbs. You've a ship to ready
for battle, don't you?

Gibbs is taken aback. Fine, if that's how he wants it:

GIBBS
Aye-aye, Captain.

He goes. Jack notices Teague, watching him.

JACK
What? You've seen it all. And
survived. That's the trick, isn't
it? To survive.

TEAGUE
It's not just about living forever,
Jackie. The trick is, living with
yourself forever.

He takes a shrunken head from his belt, offers it to Jack.

Odd. Jack takes it. Teague nods to him, and leaves him to
his thoughts.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - COMMAND DECK - MORNING

Shipwreck island in the background ... PAN TO REVEAL the
Black Pearl as it joins the Empress, and the collected pirate
ships, ready for battle. Pirates sharpen swords, clamber

over the ship, make ready for sea.

Out of the fog, a SINGLE SHIP appears, the ENDEAVOUR.

MARTY
The enemy is here! Let's take 'em!

Blood-curdling SCREAMS as PIRATES YELL their approval --
AYE! Strong, loud, confident --

MORE SHIPS appear ... more ships ... even more ships. With each 621
ship revealed, the YELLS of the pirates grow less certain.

FOG CLEARS -- revealing the HUGE ARMADA of the East India
Trading Company. Every manner of ship, HUNDREDS OF THEM,
poised and ready for battle --

IN THE SEA AHEAD, the Flying Dutchman rises up through the water 622
to lead the East India Trading Company Fleet.

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, Beckett lowers his spyglass. Groves stands
next to him.

BECKETT
Well played again, Jack. And what's
your next move?

ON THE BLACK PEARL: silence. Cotton's Parrot swoops down
wheels past, FLAP-FLAP-FLAPping its wings, getting the hell
out of there, headed back toward the island ..

All eyes turn to Jack -- eyes belonging to angry pirates
all armed -- what the hell do we do now, Sparrow?

JACK
Parlay?

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - SANDBAR - DAY 623

A sparkling white strip of sand. Jack, Elizabeth and Barbossa
walking away from a longboat beached on one side, toward a
second longboat on the other side.

The threesome draw near to three others: Beckett, Davy Jones
and Will. They regard each other in silence.

BARBOSSA
(to Will)
You be the cur that led these wolves
to our door.

BECKETT
Don't blame Turner. He was but the
tool of your betrayal.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 95.

BECKETT (CONT'D)
If you wish to see its grand architect --
look to your left.

Elizabeth, Barbossa, Jack the Monkey -- look over at Jack.
Jack looks to his left, too.
JACK
Me? My hands are clean in this.
Figuratively.
WILL

My actions were my own, to my own
purpose. Jack had nothing to do with
it.

JACK
There! Listen to the tool.

ELIZABETH
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman
I understand the burden you bear
But I fear that cause is lost.

WILL
No cause is lost if there is but one
fool left to fight for it.

Will's eyes shift toward Jack. Elizabeth clocks it -- glances
at Jack. Calculates.

BECKETT
If Turner was not acting on your
behalf, then how did he come to give
me this?

Beckett holds up Jack's Compass. That convinces Barbossa.

BECKETT (CONT'D)
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates -- and here they
are. Don't be bashful; step up and
claim your reward.

He tosses the Compass; Jack catches it.

BARBOSSA
And what reward does such chicanery
fetch these days?

BECKETT
Her.
(Will is shocked)
When the cannon smoke clears and the
brethren slaughtered, off he sails
on the Pearl, Elizabeth in his arms
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 96.
BECKETT (CONT'D)
and the blame dead square upon his
rival.

There is a moment of silence as this settles in.

JACK
Even if that was my plan -- and I'm
not admitting to anything -- there's

not a tinker's chance of it coming
off anymore.

(to Elizabeth)
Is there?

BECKETT
There never was.

JONES
Your debt to me must still be
satisfied. One hundred years in

servitude aboard the Dutchman ... as
a start.
Elizabeth reacts to the mention of the Dutchman -- she

realizes what Jack is after. A glance at Will. Will gives
the slightest indication: yes.

JACK
That debt was paid.
(to Elizabeth)
With some help.

JONES
You escaped.

JACK/ JONES
A technicality.

ELIZABETH
There's no better end for Jack Sparrow
than bilge rat aboard the Flying
Dutchman. I propose an exchange.

Will leaves with us ... and you can
have Jack.
WILL
Done.
JACK
Not done.
BECKETT

Done.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 97.

JACK
Elizabeth, love, you're condemning
me. Again.

BARBOSSA

Jack is one of the Nine Pirate Lords.
You have no right!

ELIZABETH
King.

Barbossa frowns, realizes: Jack is up to something. Jack
doffs his hat.

JACK
As you command, your nibs.

He starts to cross to Beckett -- Barbossa grabs Jack's
shoulder and whirls him around even as he draws his sword.

BARBOSSA
Blaggar!

Jack evades, but not quite -- Jack's circlet coin drops to
the sand. Jack the Monkey scurries to pick up the coin. Jack
raises his eyes to Barbossa. The two men regard each other

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
If you have something to say, I might
be saying something as well.

JACK
First to the finish, then.

Will and Jack complete the cross. Jones shoves Jack down.

JONES
Do you fear death?

JACK
You have no idea.

BECKETT
Advise your 'Brethren': you can fight
and all of you will die. Or you can
not fight, in which case only most
of you will die.

ELIZABETH
You murdered my father

BECKETT
He chose his own fate.
624

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 98.

ELIZABETH
And you have chosen yours. We will
fight ... and surely you will die.
BECKETT

So be it.

Elizabeth and Will turn away. Jack the Monkey drops the coin
into Barbossa's hand. Barbossa contemplates it, closes his
fist, follows. Still tense, with their backs exposed:

WILL
"King?"
ELIZABETH
Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of
Jack.
Will is impressed.
WILL
Maybe he really does know what he's
doing.

out through the bars as Maccus moves past.

Oh, yes, bravo!

Except for this little sojourn in

But we've got momentum on our side!

A FOURTH JACK opens his EYES -- this one is well on his way
to becoming part of the Dutchman, like Wyvern. He pulls away
from the wall, exposing his brain.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 99.

WYVERN JACK
Stab the heart!

All three other Jacks look over at him.

WYVERN JACK (CONT'D)
Step foot ashore but once every ten

It does seem to put immortality a

Poppycock?

JACK LEFT

He's never said 'poppycock.

JACK
I've never even thought 'poppycock.'

JACK RIGHT
Just then you did.

JACK
I did not --

All three suddenly clutch their heads and yell in pain. They
look over at Wyvern Jack -- he's got his BRAIN in his HAND.
He squeezes it again; again, all three clutch their heads
and yell in pain.

JACK LEFT
Should he being doing that?

JACK RIGHT
That can't be good for us!

Wyvern Jack SQUEEZES again --

Stop it! Stop! You're giving me a

And that reminds him of something:

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY 625

Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa climb aboard.

ELIZABETH
We'll need the Black Pearl to serve
as our flagship, and lead the attack

BARBOSSA
Will we, now?

Will spots: TIA DALMA, being led onto deck by Pintel and
several of the Chinese pirates. She is manacled, and bound
with heavy ropes. Will knows what it means --

WILL
Barbossa, you can't release her.

BARBOSSA
Can't I, now?

Suddenly Chinese pirates surround he and Elizabeth, restrain
them. Barbossa gives Pintel and Ragetti an approving nod.
They drag Tia Dalma to the mast.

ELIZABETH
We've got to give Jack a chance!

BARBOSSA
Apologies, your highness. But 'tis
certain the world we know ends today,
and I won't be letting the likes of
Cutler Beckett say what comes next --
and I won't be pinning my hopes on
Jack Sparrow, either. Too long has
my fate not been in my own hands. No
longer!

He wraps his fist around the Captain's Knot Elizabeth wears --
then tears it free --

EXT. ENDEAVOUR - DAY 626

Beckett returns to the command deck --

They have chosen oblivion. Ready the

SUDDENLY THE WIND DIES. They look up. All the sails are flat.
All the ships are stopped.

ELIZABETH
Is there an incantation?

BARBOSSA

(remembering)
Aye, the items brought together
done. Has to be performed over water
we lucked out there. Items burned.
And some person must speak the words,
"Calypso, I release you from your
human bonds."

PINTEL
Is that it?

BARBOSSA
"Twas said it must be spoken softly,
as if to a lover.

Barbossa grabs Gibbs' rum bottle, smashes it over the pile.
Shoves the punk into the pile --

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Calypso, I release you from your
human bonds!

All look at Tia Dalma as the items smolder. Nothing else
happens.

PINTEL
Is that it?

RAGETTI
You didn't say it right!

Everyone stares at Ragetti. Even Ragetti would stare at
Ragetti if he could; he's surprised he spoke up.

RAGETTI (CONT'D)
(defensive)
You have to say it right.

Ragetti steps up to Tia Dalma. Says softly and with genuine
love of the sea --
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 102.

RAGETTI (CONT'D)
Calypso, I release you from your
human bonds.

The punk in the bowl bursts into FLAME, the flame licking
upward in a twisting column -- and then its gone. The pieces
of eight decay, their age overtaking them --

Tia Dalma GASPS. She sags. The manacles on her hand become
pitted with corrosion, fragile with rust. She shudders, and
they break, fall to the deck.

Will struggles forward --

Tia Dalma! Calypso!
(she raises her eyes)
When the Brethren Court first
imprisoned you ... who was it that
told them how? Who was it that
betrayed you?

TIA DALMA
Name him.

WILL
Davy Jones.

Her eyes shoot toward the Flying Dutchman, rage building
behind them. And then --

629 Tia Dalma_ starts to transform. Her eyes change color, her hair 629
ripples with no wind. She rises up ... Crew members try to restrain
her. Ropes pull through their hands --

Then ropes snap. The deck buckles under he weight as she
grows TENFOLD IN SIZE, a Harryhausen vision amid the sails.

Barbossa kneels; others follow suit.

BARBOSSA

Calypso. I come before you as but a
servant, humble and contrite. I have
fulfilled my vow, and now ask your
favor. Spare my self, my ship, my
crew -- but unleash your fury upon
those who dare pretend themselves
your masters, or mine!

Calypso barely takes notice of him ... long enough to say a
single word that BOOMS out over the deck --

CALYPSO
FOOL!
630

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 103.

Barbossa's eyes go wide -- his long-odds gamble did not pay
off --
Then, suddenly, she collapses, crashes down to the deck in the 630

form of ten thousand crabs --

Crabs everywhere, a torrent running across the deck, tossing
pirates aside. Crabs flow out over the sides of the ship
and Calypso is gone. Silence.

WILL
Is that it?

PINTEL
Why, she's no help at all!
(to Barbossa)
What now?

The WIND PICKS UP AGAIN, causing the sails to shudder --

BARBOSSA
Nothing. Our final hope has failed
us.

One of the pirate's hats is taken by the wind; it spirals up
and around the mast. Elizabeth watches it

ELIZABETH
It's not over

Will overhears her.

WILL
Hope is not lost. There's still a
fight to be had.

GIBBS
There's an armada arrayed against
us. We've got no chance of winnin'.

ELIZABETH
(still watching the
wind)
Only a fool's chance ...

BARBOSSA
Revenge won't bring your father back
Miss Swann --
-- it's like a slap in the face to Elizabeth --
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
-- and it's not something I'm
intending to die for.

Elizabeth realizes: Nothing can bring her father back
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 104.

ELIZABETH
You're right.
(beat)
Then what shall we all die for?

She steps up onto the rail of the ship.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

(to the crew)
Listen to me! The Brethren will still
be looking here, to us, to the Black
Pearl, to lead. What will they see?
Frightened bilge rats aboard a
derelict ship? No. They will see
free men. And freedom! And what the
enemy will see is the flash of our
cannons. They will hear the ring of
our swords. And they will know what
we can do --

(to Barbossa)
-- by the sweat of our brows and the
strength of our backs --

(to all)
-- and the courage of our hearts.

She casts a gaze around the deck, meeting the eyes of several
crewmen, ending on Will.

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Hoist the colours.

Will nods, repeats it: low, resolved.

WILL
Hoist the colours.

GIBBS
Hoist the colours.

PINTEL
Hoist the colours

It's picked up by the crew, a murmur as they move with purpose
to their stations, past and around Barbossa. One begins to
sing softly "Yo ho, all hands, hoist the colours high ..."

GIBBS
We've got the wind on our side, boys,
and that's all we need!

Elizabeth, still on the rail, turns to where the Empress
lay, shouts across to Tai Huang:

takes out the two guards.

Mercer looks gratefully at Jones; the look turns to horror
as Jones' tentacle beard wraps around Mercer's neck

Mercer chokes; MOVE AROUND to show Jones' face as Mercer's
neck snaps. Mercer falls to the ground --

Held up briefly by the chain, with the key, held by Jones'

MULLROY
Halt there, or we'll shoot!

Jack stops.

JACK
Good one. I just came to see my
effects. Admirable though it is
why are you here when you could be
somewhere else?

MURTOGG
Someone has to stay and guard the
chest.

MULLROY

No question, there's been a breakdown
in military discipline aboard this
vessel.

MURTOGG
I blame the fish people.

MULLROY
Oh, so fish people, by dint of being
fish people, automatically aren't as
disciplined as non-fish people?

MURTOGG
Seems contributory, is all I'm
suggesting.

Jack, meanwhile, has approached the chest and now he picks
it up and sneaks off as they are arguing.

MULLROY
It is true that if there are no fish
people there would be no reason to
guard the chest.

MURTOGG
If there were no chest, there would
be nothing to guard.
At that moment they both look down to see the chest is gone.

Jack draws his own sword.

Jones leaps at Jack, swords clashing --

Elizabeth! Dying for something, that's
the easy part. What are we going to
live for?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 112.

Elizabeth gives him a "you've got to be kidding" look, and
then more attackers are upon them.

ELIZABETH
Right now is not the best time!

They fight around opposite sides of the capstan, come
together:

WILL
(with a chuckle in
his voice)
Right now may be the only time! I
love you!

They are separated again, and then Will catches her hand:

WILL (CONT'D)
I've made my choice. What's yours?

Her eyes never leave his; she decides:

ELIZABETH
Barbossa!

Will's a bit surprised at that answer but then it becomes
clear, even as attackers separate them again:

ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
Marry us!

On the deck above, Barbossa fights off several Crewmen.

BARBOSSA
I'm a little busy at the moment.

Elizabeth and Will fight on opposite sides of the deck:

WILL
Barbossa! Now!

BARBOSSA
Fine, then!

He climbs atop the binnacle cabinet as they come back together --
now's the time to begin the ceremony.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Dearly beloved and others, we are

He's beset by attackers; so are they. As they fight down the

Jones sneers and attacks. Will looks over -- sees Elizabeth

Jones wades in, beats Elizabeth backwards --

Will slashes at Bootstrap, disarms him. Grabs Bootstrap,
slams him into the rail.

Will pulls out his knife ... raises it. Looks like he is
going to stab him --

Bootstrap looks down, stares at the knife. It looks familiar
He tries to remember

Jack rolls over on deck: right in front of his eyes is the
tentacle crawling past him, headed back to its master --
dragging the key. Jack grabs it, worms the tentacle away --
looks over. The chest is sitting right there.

Jack smiles.

Jones backhands Elizabeth with his claw -- and suddenly a
sword appears -- right through his chest. Davy Jones looks
over his shoulder -- Will is behind him. Jones looks down.

Missed. Did you forget? I ama

Will to the deck.

Will's eyes shift toward Elizabeth. Jones looks from Will to
Elizabeth -- processes their relationship.

Ah. Love. A dreadful bond.

Will backs away -- he has no weapon -- he is helpless. Jones
pulls the sword through his body, tosses it aside.

Jones raises his own sword.

heart in his hand. He squeezes it -- and Jones staggers,
clutches at his chest.

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, Beckett sees the Black Pearl, sails luffing,
helpless.

GROVES
What is he waiting for?

BECKETT
He expects us to honor our agreement.

Beckett shrugs --

BELOW HIM, on the gun deck the CANNON PORTS OPEN and the
CANNONS emerge --

ON THE BLACK PEARL, its sails flapping, Gibbs watches the Endeavour
move into position against them.

GIBBS
Didn't figure for it to end this
way. Always pictured an angry husband.

JACK
Reasonable.

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, as Beckett sails in for the kill --
BECKETT
Nothing personal, Jack. It's just
good business.
SUDDENLY
THE FLYING DUTCHMAN APPEARS,

UP FROM THE DEPTHS, sailing alongside the Black Pearl. A
clean slate grey, no longer encrusted --

ON THE PEARL, Jack grins --

JACK
Full canvas!

BARBOSSA
Aye full canvas!

ON THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, WILLIAM TURNER steps out on deck, a dark
avenging anger in his eyes, and now in control of the Flying
Dutchman --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 123.

ON THE BLACK PEARL, Barbossa spins the wheel --

The Dutchman and the Black Pearl split, sail to either side
of the Endeavour, trapping it in between.

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, Beckett stares in disbelief.

Groves, next to him, stares out and sees their doom. To
Beckett --

GROVES
Orders, sir?
(waits, nervous)

Sir?
(waits)
Sir -- what do you commmand?
Beckett stares across -- at Jack. States Jack Sparrow's
question, to himself, with resignation, disgust, amazement:
BECKETT
Who am I?
Groves sees that Beckett has lost it -- turns away.
GROVES
Abandon ship! All hands! Abandon
ship!
With other crewmen, Groves races for the rail -- vaults over --
ON THE DUTCHMAN,
WILL
FIRE!
ON THE PEARL,
JACK
FIRE!

THE DUTCHMAN AND THE BLACK PEARL OPEN FIRE. And we see the full
fury of these two ships for the first time.

CANNONS BLAST -- AND BLAST -- AND BLAST -- AND BLAST. A
furious broadside --

Beckett's ship is blown away.

ON THE ENDEAVOUR, Beckett steps forward, shots landing all around.
Give him credit, he is fearless in the face of death.

A mast falls, Beckett doesn't flinch. The deck gives way --

EXT. PIRATE SHIPS - VARIOUS - DAY 691

Teague raises his fist and SHOUTS. Villenueva grins. Sumbhajee
CHEERS --

IN THE CARIBBEAN SEA, Beckett fights to stay above water. The 692
East India Company flag floats down, covers him. A brief struggle
beneath it, and the flag flattens on the water

ON THE BLACK PEARL, the crew cheers. In the midst are MURTOGG and 693
MULLROY, trying to their best to blend in.

MURTOGG
Aarrgh!

MULLROY
Shiver me timbers!

MURTOGG
And mine.

That's doesn't sound right to Pintel and Ragetti; they turn
toward the (ex-)Marines

Jack and Gibbs watch as CAPTAINS of the other Armada ships
see the destruction, turn their sails.

MARTY
They're running!

GIBBS
Aye, they're terrified to take on
the combined might of the Dutchman
and the Pearl!

JACK
I've never seen a retreat from the
other side before. Gibbs, you may
fling my hat.

Gibbs takes Jack's hat and throws it up into the air --
EXT. FLYING DUTCHMAN - DECK - DAY 694

Captain William Turner stands on deck, looking out toward
the Black Pearl. Bootstrap steps up beside him.

BOOTSTRAP
Orders, sir?

Will is surprised.
WILL

You're no longer bound to the
Dutchman. You're free.
695

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 125.

BOOTSTRAP
It's a fine thing. But by my
reckoning, I've still got a debt
that needs be paid. If you'll have
me.

Will regards him, a smile fighting to break across his face.
He gestures toward the wheel:

WILL
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner

BOOTSTRAP
Aye, Captain Turner.

Will's gaze is drawn back to Elizabeth; Bootstrap notes it.

BOOTSTRAP (CONT'D)
One day ashore, ten years at sea.
It's a steep price to pay for what's
been done.

WILL
That depends on the one day.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY 695

Elizabeth moves to a waiting longboat, past the crew. Barbossa
nods to her.

GIBBS
Your chariot awaits, your highness.
Oars are inside.

BARBOSSA
Mrs. Turner.

Jack waits next to the longboat.

ELIZABETH
(a smile)
Jack Sparrow. It never would have
worked out between us.

JACK

You keep telling yourself that.
ELIZABETH

Thank you.
JACK

Every king needs a queen.
696

697

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 126.

They lean together for a kiss, Jack thinks better of it;
smiling, she turns away --

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. SHIPWRECK ISLAND - BEACH - DAY 696

Elizabeth sits down on a rock near the water's edge, arms
wrapped around her knees. Lost in thought.

WILL (0.S.)
Elizabeth.

She looks up -- Will is there, standing in the water. She
goes out to him, into the water.

WILL (CONT'D)

Ten years is a long time ... and I
don't expect the world to stop
turning.

ELIZABETH

I'll keep it safe.
He gazes into her eyes, slowly nods: he has faith. He smiles.

WILL
You've ruined your dress.

She blinks back tears. He reaches a hand out for her cheek
ELIZABETH
Will...
(remembering the very
first meeting)
Will Turner.

WILL
Captain ... Will Turner.

He leans forward to kiss her. Their lips meet, softly. She
shuts her eyes as the kiss takes her ...

CLOSE ON: ELIZABETH'S EYES ... she opens them slowly, sees:
The Flying Dutchman, bound for the sunset.
Will is gone. She turns .... REVEAL, on the shore, is the
Chest. Elizabeth raises it, holds it close, watches the
ship as it gets lost in the sun...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. TORTUGA - DOCKS - DAY 697

Jack comes down the ramp with Scarlett and Gisele his arms.
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 127.

JACK
Granted, it tends to list to port
and has been known on occasion to
frighten young women, but I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

GISELLE
Is that it? The Black Pearl?

SCARLETT
It's not very big.

Jack glances at a small boat.

JACK
Please, love. That is a dingy. My
vessel is magnificent and fierce and
huge-ish and ... gone. Why is it
gone?

Giselle spots the Black Pearl, far out to sea.

GISELLE
Is that it there?
JACK
Yes, there. There it is. Why is it

there?
(The girls squint)
It's much larger up close.

SCARLETT
Oh, but Jack, you promised me a ride.
GISELLE
I was to be given a ride first.
SCARLETT
What. You?
GISELLE
Better than you.
SCARLETT
Not what he said.
GISELLE
I never!
SCARLET
I seen you!
GISELLE

 

Learn anything?
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 128.

SCARLETT

I learnt you stole my stays.
GISELLE

I never!
SCARLETT

You're wearing ‘em!

Cat fight ensues. OVER THIS: Jack spots Gibbs, dozing
peacefully on the dock

JACK
Mr. Gibbs. Is there any particular
reason my ship is gone?

GIBBS
Ship? We're on the ship. Jack! The
ship is gone!

JACK
Girls! Will you PLEASE! Shut it!

The ladies freeze, mid-motion tugging each other's hair.

JACK (CONT'D)
Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you
no, I don't love you, of course it
makes you look fat, I have never
been to Brussels, it is pronounced
"egregious," no, I haven't met Pizarro
but I love his pies, and all of this
pales to insignificance in light of
the fact that my ship is gone! Savvy?

SLAP! Jack's head is snapped to the side. SLAP! Back the
other way. The girls storm off. Gibbs looks at Jack

GIBBS
Take what you can.

JACK
Give nothing back.

It is a farewell. Gibbs heads off after the ladies.
GIBBS
Tell me, how much do you know about
sea turtles?
Jack turns to gaze out to sea, gaze fixed on the horizon.
698 EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY 698

Barbossa enjoys the sun on his face. Opens his eyes -- Pintel,
Ragetti, Cotton, Marty and others are gathered before him.
699

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 129.
Murtogg and Mullroy attempt to look inconspicuous.

PINTEL
Sir, some of the men don't feel
entirely settled about leaving Captain
Jack behind --

RAGETTI
Again.

PINTEL
Again.

BARBOSSA
Is that so?

PINTEL

So we were hoping, it would make us
feel a whole lot better regardin'
our fortunes, if we could see that
item you told us about.

MARTY
On the charts.

PINTEL
With our own eyes.

RAGETTI
To help put an ease to our burden of
guilt, so to speak.

BARBOSSA
Ah. Cast your eyes over this, then,
mateys ... there's more than one way
to live forever.
Barbossa pulls out the charts -- the Pirates lean forward.
Barbossa unrolls them -- there is a large HOLE in the center

where the map has been cut out.
EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY 699

CLOSE ON: the Charts. Jack cautiously rotates the inner
circle... revealing a new map. On it: A drawing of a fountain.

Inscribed on the curve: Ponce de Leon.

Jack smiles, pulls out his compass, opens it -- and is shocked
to see:

The needle points to almost directly behind him.
That can't be right. He looks around -- and finds: a bottle

of rum, tucked away behind the seat. He picks it up, checks
the compass again; whatever he sees makes him smile --
700

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 130.

He leans back, pulls the cork, takes a swig ... begins to
hum...
JACK
... we're devils and black sheep,
really bad eggs ... Drink up me

hearties, yo ho...

And so Jack Sparrow leaves us the way he arrived, alone, on
a small boat, sailing into the sunset --

EXT. BEACH - DAY 700
FADE UP ON: Elizabeth, lit by the light of sunset.

ELIZABETH
We're beggars and blighters, ne'er-
do-well cads ...

SON (0.S.)
(just a little behind)
. Ne'er-do-well cads ...

She beams down. REVEAL: Elizabeth stands barefoot on shore,
holding the hand of a NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY, who sits atop a
very familiar chest.

ELIZABETH/SON

Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho...
ELIZABETH

Yes, that's right
ELIZABETH/SON

Aye, but we're loved by our mums and

our dads --
But her SON has broken off after "mums," leaving Elizabeth
to sing the "and our dads" alone, because he has spotted
something on the horizon.
Elizabeth looks where he points --
CLOSE ON: ELIZABETH, here eyes searching. She sees something,
breaks into a radiant smile as a GREEN FLASH lights up her
features --

BLACK
