FADE IN:
EXT. STONE RUIN - DAY
A SWORD flashes in the sunlight as it whirls down on...

SIR BOWEN...a ruggedly handsome knight who catches the blade
on his own, just inches from his face, and smiles through the
crossed swords, eyes gleaming like the sunlit steel.

BOWEN
Not bad!

He disengages his blade with swift flare and, in a dazzling
series of sallies, forces his OPPONENT back.

BOWEN
But not good enough to...

The opponent, BACK TO CAMERA, is shoved to the ground,
Bowen's sword tip at his throat.

BOWEN
«+-to live!

Bowen grins down at...

PRINCE EINON...a fourteen year old boy, his face flush from
exertion. Emblazoned on his surcote is a DRAGON'S HEAD
impaled on a sword. A HERALDIC COAT-OF-ARMS.

Suddenly, Einon kicks Bowen's blade aside with his boot,
rolls, and springs up, lunging at the knight. Again, Bowen
deflects the blade by inches. Smiling. Pleased.

BOWEN
Better!

Einon is also pleased. He smiles at Bowen's praise and lets
down his guard. Just slightly. But enough. With a nimble
parry, Bowen blade arcs down, striking the startled boy...but
only with the flat of the blade on his shoulder.

BOWEN
But you'd still be dead!

Einon reels back and, with a snarl, charges wildly at Bowen
who, laughing, leaps upon a crumbling piece of stone, easily
deflecting or ducking the violent but clumsy blows.

BOWEN
Purpose, not passion, Einon! Fight with
your head, not your heart!
He punctuates each maxim with a slap of his sword flat,
obviously toying with the boy.

BOWEN
Nerve cold-blue, blade blood-red.

Einon slices wickedly at Bowen's legs. Bowen leaps up as the
blade swishes harmlessly under him. But as he lands, the
edge of the stone crumbles beneath the heel of his boot. He
teeters, then tumbles off the rock, out of sight behind it.

Einon's savage fighting demeanour slides into a shocked gasp
of concern.

EINON
Sir Bowen?

He scrambles over the stone to find Bowen sprawled out on the
ground, apparently unconscious. As Einon leans down to
examine him, he's suddenly distracted by HOOFBEATS. He
whirls to the sound as...

RIDERS...gallop toward them. As Einon squints in the sun to
identify them, A FIGURE towers up behind him and a sword
glints at his throat. Bowen leers over his shoulder.

BOWEN
Dead again, Prince! How many times must
I tell you?

BOWEN & EINON
(reciting together)
Only expose your back to a corpse!

But the fencing lesson is over. Einon points to the riders,

EINON
It's happened.

Bowen scowls as Three Riders approach, led by A MASSIVE BRUTE
OF A KNIGHT...SIR BROK...Einon knows why he's come.

EINON
The peasants are revolting.

BROK

(grins)
They've always been revolting, Prince.
Smell one sometime. But now they're
rebelling.

(to Bowen)
King Freyne would have his son witness
his noble victory.

BOWEN
(contemptuous1ly)
Noble...? Crushing desperate, frightened
men...?
BROK
(sharply)
Traitorous scum! The King commands.
Bring him. You can watch too, nursemaid.

He whips his horse and rides off with the others. Bowen
turns to get his and Einon's horses. . Einon is disappointed
that Bowen allowed Brok's insult to go unchallenged.

EINON
Why do you let him insult you like that?
You, a Knight of the Old Code! You're
not afraid of him!

BOWEN
(laughs)
Nor his opinions. I expect no less.
(distaste)
He's the king's man.

Einon registers Bowen's contempt for the king with an uneasy
scowl, but as Bowen turns to hand him his reins, the boy
beams affectionately at him.

EINON
When I am king, you will be my man,
Bowen.

Bowen claps him warmly on the shoulder and helps the prince
into the saddle.

BOWEN
I am already your man, my prince.

He swings into the saddle and, as the two ride after Brok,
CAMERA PANS TO THE GALLOPING HOOVES.

EXT, KARA'S VILLAGE - FIELD - DAY
CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM MANY MORE GALLOPING HOOVES TO REVEAL:

A TROOP OF MOUNTED, ARMOURED KNIGHTS...as they ride out of
the smoke and dust of battle. At their head is...

KING FREYNE...sword aloft. Visor raised. Eyes hard and
hateful. On his helmet glints a GOLD CIRCLET. A CROWN.
Emblazoned on his surcote is the same DRAGON’S HEAD impaled
on a sword we saw on Einon's surcote.

He rides through the carnage of a 10th CENTURY BATTLE,
leading mounted SOLDIERS against a RABBLE OF PEASANTS.

Slashing with mad glee, Freyne mows down men armed only with
crude farm implements. It is slaughter as the rebels are
driven back through their own crude lines of defense...over-
turned carts, ditches, an earthen bulwark. None of which
impede Freyne's onslaught.
EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - HILLOCK - DAY

Bowen and Einon sit their horses on a hillock behind the
lines watching the carnage. Bowen is disgusted, Einon
fascinated.

EINON
I wish we were down there.
BOWEN
(curtly)
You don't.
EINON

Ido. Just to see you in action, Bowen.
Yours would be the finest blade on the

field.

BOWEN
Too fine to foul with your father's
slaughter.

In a quiet, hurt tone, Einon gently reminds Bowen of good
manners and protocol.

EINON
He is my father, Bowen. And the king.

Bowen takes the admonishment with a kind smile.

BOWEN
Yes...But when you are king, remember
today. Remember the difference between
battle and butchery. And remember the
Qld Code. Restore its forgotten glory,
so that the crown will shine with honour
once more and never again will men have
to take up arms against their sovereign.
Then you will be a greater king than
your father.

Bowen turns to watch the ungallant battle with weary eyes and
thus doesn't see the dark glint in Einon's gaze,

EINON
I promise, Bowen, I will be greater. And
no one will take arms against me...Look!
Father's breached the village.

He points to the king down below, galloping toward the
bulwark, cutting down men right and left.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - BATTLE - DAY

Freyne descends on a YOUTH -- wearing a BUCKET with one side

cut out as a crude helmet -~ who stumbles between two
HAYRACKS mounted in a gap in the bulwark.
A large meaty paw reaches out and grabs BUCKETHEAD by the
jerkin, yanking the youth behind...

THE BULWARK...Buckethead flops into a LARGE MUD PUDDLE on the
other side. Buckethead's saviour is a RED-BEARDED GIANT,
whose unruly mane is bound by a LEATHER HEAD-BAND.

Armed with a scythe, Red-beard knocks the sword from Freyne's
hand as the king rides in through the breach. Another rebel
charges the king with a burning torch, but gets a gauntlet in
the face as Freyne punches him and snatches his torch. He
whirls his steed back for the bulwark.

But Red-beard signals several men at the hayracks, who pull
SPIKED WOODEN BREASTWORKS out from under the racks and cut
off Freyne's escape route.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - HILLOCK - DAY

Bowen and Einon watch from their vantage point as a HORDE OF
VILLAGERS chase the trapped Freyne. Freyne zig-zags his
horse in and out and under the stilts of SEVERAL RAISED
GRAINHOUSES, torching some as he passes. But the peasants
are closing in.

EINON
(anxiously)
He's trapped!

The boy draws his sword and spurs his horse down the hill
through the melee!

BOWEN
Einon, no!

He follows after the boy.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - BATTLE - DAY

Bowen closes in on his young charge when he's beset by REBEL
WARRIORS. He ducks the savage thrust of a pitchfork and,
grabbing the shaft, cracks the WIELDER under the jaw with the
blunt end. Another rebel gets clouted by Bowen's boot even
as the knight knocks another down with the shaft of the
pitchfork. He kills no one. But even as he scatters them,
he's lost Einon in the dusty haze of the battle. He shouts.

BOWEN
Einon!
EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - BATTLE - ON FREYNE - DAY
Red-beard and a MOTLEY BAND OF REBELS close in on Freyne, the

king's horse snorts and rears as Freyne whirls his torch,
trying to pry an opening through the rebel mass.
But they catch him under one of the granaries and pull him
from the saddle. Freyne clanks to the ground in a cacophony
of armour and chainmail. at the feet of...

BUCKETHEAD...who's shoved aside again as Redbeard and the
others crowd around the fallen king. Crude weapons rise and
fall. Buckethead jerks away, unable to watch.

Then it's over as RED-BEARD and the others race to defend
their village from Freyne's men who have breach the
barricade. Only Buckethead remains, queasily staring at the
dead king. A WILD WAIL pierces the battle clamour.

EINON (0S)
Father!

-Buckethead swiftly clambers up the granary ladder as...

EINON...gallops through a veil of smoke over the bulwark.
Dismounting, he scrambles to his father, laying a hand to his
lifeless breast... and pulling it back with a shudder,
covered in blood.

Stunned, Einon stares from his hand to his father and
then...to the crown...perched atop Freyne's helmet.
Trembling, he reaches over the body for it. As he does,
Freyne's eyes suddenly FLICKER OPEN AND STARE into Einon's,
who hesitates...then snatches the crown off anyway...even as
Freyne groans his last and his eyes glaze in deathly
admonishment at his heir.

 

As Einon pulls back from his dead father, he holds up the
crown. It glints brilliantly in the firelight. Something
else also glints. Buckethead's KNIFE as Einon sees the
flying body leap off the granary platform down onto him.

The impact of their collision sends the boys sprawling across
the ground spilling against a breastwork, a jumble of arms
and legs. The bucket helmet clatters off as the rebel flops
face-down, a cascade of red hair falling toe his shoulders.

Einon lurches off the breastwork, grasping a STAKE for
support. It is sticky with BLOOD. His blood. It oozes from
a gash in his chest, spilling across his ripped dragonhead
crest.

Einon spies the CROWN half-in, half-out of a mud puddle. He
weaves toward it on unsteady legs, then sags into the mud,
his fingers locking on the circlet. Gasping weakly, he stares
glassy-eyed at Buckethead, staggering up.

Even unhelmeted, Buckethead's face is A BLUR in Einon's hazy
vision. All he sees is flaming hair, blending into the fiery
light of a hut burning behind then.

BOWEN (0S)
Einon!
Einon's vision pops into crystal clear FOCUS as Buckethead
whirls to the anguished CRY...and we discover THE BOY IS A
GIRL!. Her name is...as we later learn...KARA. She's
roughly Einon's age and even the grime of battle cannot hide
her beauty, haloed in an aureole of gleaming red hair.

As Kara sees Bowen's steed leap over the breastworks and her.
Bowen wildly spins the horse toward the fallen Einon, leaning
down in the saddle and scooping up his wounded charge.

EINON
Bowen!

BOWEN
I'm here, my prince...my king.

He whirls his horse back around and, sideswiping, a BARRELL
OF MILK, bounds over the barricade once more. Kara dives out
of the way, landing near the spilt milk now running into and
mixing with the blood of battle.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - BATTLE - ON BOWEN & EINON - DAY

Einon slumps back in Bowen's arms as the horse charges
through the battlefield.

EXT. OLD CASTLE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - AFTERNOON

A WOODEN FORTRESS looms out of the shadow of a mountain.
Grimly impressive. Bowen's steed breaks from the forest and
races across the plain toward the Fortress gates.

INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - OLD CASTLE ~- CLOSE-UP - BLOOD - NIGHT
A wounded Brok kneels before AISLINN, the Queen.

BROK
Dead, Madam...King Freyne, your husband,
slain.

She takes the news stoically, staring out the window in
impassive resignation. A DOOR slams open. Aislinn spins to
the sound. Silhouetted in the light of the open door stands
a KNIGHT, A LIMP FORM CRADLED IN HIS ARMS.

With a gut-sinking premonition, Aislinn weaves to the door.
A single TEAR trickles muddily down Bowen's grimey face as
Aislinn gasps at her crumpled son.

BOWEN
Forgive me, my Queen.
QUEEN
It's not your fault. The cruel excesses
of his father brought him to this end.

She gestures to a bed. Bowen lays him on it.

EINON
The crown...

QUEEN
He lives!

BOWEN

He dies, Madan...

Bowen slides the crown off his arm and places it in the boy's
vhand.

BOWEN
«+.Beyond all help.

AISLINN
Not all...

Aislinn turns to Bowen...curiously calm even hopeful.

EXT. RUINS ON PROMONTORY - LOOKING UP - DUSK

The sun sinks behind a promontory as FIGURES trek through the
RUINS OF AN OLD CASTLE up the mountain.

EXT. RUINS - MOUNTAIN TRAIL - DUSK

Aislinn, on horseback, leads Bowen and a body of GUARDS up a
mountain path, through the RUINS OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN CASTLE.
Brok and the others bear Einon on a hide stretcher supported
on spears. Walking his horse, Bowen hovers over the semi-
conscious boy who still grips the crown and talks to him.

BOWEN
(reciting)
A knight is sworn to valour...

EINON
+«.sworn... to valour...

BOWEN
His heart knows only virtue...

EINON
.--virtue...

BOWEN
His blade defends the helpless. His
might upholds the weak...
Bowen is suddenly distracted by an EERIE MUSICAL TRILLING.
Sad and melancholy. It comes from further up the mountain.
The others hear it as well. Except for Einon whose mumble
drifts to a groan. Bowen shakes him.

BOWEN
You must stay awake, my lord. You must!
Recite the code...

EINON

-.-code...
BOWEN

Yes! His might upholds the weak...
EINON

-.-his...word speaks only truth...
BOWEN

Yes... yes... His wrath...?

BOWEN & EINON
(reciting together)
His wrath undoes the wicked.

EXT. CAVE - VISTA SHOT - NIGHT

Night has descended. The moon glows a bright scarlet. The
party stops before a CAVE, lighting torches. Bowen dismounts
and gathers Einon off the stretcher into his arms.

EXT. CAVE MOUTH - NIGHT

Aislinn takes a torch and starts into the cave. From within
echoes the mournful, musical TRILL. Bowen eyes her warily.

BOWEN
I know what place this is. It has the
stink of dragon.

AISLINN
Not the Dragon's stench; merely man's
pollution of him. Come and fear not!

Aislinn enters. Bowen, Einon in his arms, hesitantly
follows.

INT. CAVE ~ NIGHT

Even torchlight cannot dispel the gloom. Their light and
shafts of scarlet moonlight, seeping through two holes in the
cavern roof, illuminate bubbling mud pits and bones. Steam
wreathes through the place. From the cave's recesses comes a
faint IRRIDESCENT RIPPLE OF MOVEMENT. And the melancholy
TRILL. Toward this Aislinn cautiously, humbly, approaches.
10

AISLINN
Lord! Serene One!

Her voice echoes. The TRILLING stops. The Guards murmur
uneasily. Bowen warily eyes The GLOW. It seems BRIGHTER.
Defining an UNCERTAIN SHAPE. Aislinn signals for silence.

AISLINN
Your song is sad tonight.

DRAGON
There are no stars in the sky?

The VOICE...sad yet strangely soothing... comes from the
large, eerie shape shimmering in the shadows. It, too, is
large and eerie. Aislinn moves to the glow.

AISLINN
No...only a moon. Blood-red.

Bowen eases Einon down. Hovering protectively over him,
suspiciously listening, his eye never leaving the creature in
the shadows. The peculiar irridescence is the beast's scaly
hide that emits a wavering glow as he shifts.

DRAGON
Aislinn. Daughter of Athelstun.

AISLINN
Yes, Lord, whose people loved you and
called your kind friend.

DRAGON
Once. Long ago. No more. No longer
fickle man's friend. Feared. Forgotten.

AISLINN
I have not forgotten. I do not fear.

Einon sighs. Aislinn kneels beside Bowen to comfort her son,
stroking his brow, as the boy feverishly fondles the crown.

The Dragon's half~hooded eye glints from the darkness,
surveying the prince. The crown caressed in his hands.

DRAGON
Freyne's child.

Aislinn desperately whirls on the dragon.

DRAGON
Is this why you come, Draonslayer's wife?
il

AISLINN

Dragonslayer's widow! A bride of
conquest! My people driven out and
slaughtered even as yours.

(kneels)
Please! He's not his father.

(points to Bowen)
This knight is his mentor. He has taught
him the Old Code. And I will teach him
your ways.

The dragon's scales brightly ripple. He considers her plea,
his baleful eye falling on the boy's bloody breast.

DRAGON
The wound is deep. You know what you ask?

AISLINN
(kneels before him)
I swear. He will grow in your grace.
Grow just and good.

The dragon's shadowy head inclines toward Einon.

DRAGON
He must swear. Your sword, knight.

Aislinn nods to Bowen. He reluctantly unsheathes it to hand
to her, but the Dragon's CLAW emerges from the dark and grips
the blade in his talons. Bowen instinctively lets go.

The dragon extends the hilt to Einon who stirs and, seeing
the shadowy creature above, gasps.

AISLINN
Fear not, child, he will save you.

DRAGON
But first, boy, by the cross of the
sword, swear that your Father's bloodlust
and tyranny die with him. Swear that you
will live and rule with mercy. And come
to me and learn. The Once-ways. Swear!

"Swear, swear, swear..." his sibilance echoes through the
darkness. Einon clutches the sword to his breast.

EINON
I...swear...

Einon leans up to kiss the pommel, then suddenly slumps in
Bowen's arms. Bowen shakes him.

BOWEN
Einon? Einon! He's dead!
12

In angry grief, Bowen grabs the sword hilt to wrest it from
the Dragon. But as he yanks, the Dragon's TALONS SCRAPE DOWN
THE LENGTH OF THE BLADE WITH A WHINING SCREECH, SCORING A
GROOVE INTO IT FROM GUARD TO TIP.

DRAGON
Peace, Knight of the Old Code...

The Dragon suddenly blows out the torches, immersing them in
darkness. Save for the occasional glint of his shimmering
scales and his glowing eyes.

DRAGON
-».And witness the wonders of an even
more ancient glory.

The Dragon releases the sword and places a talon against his
breast, IMPALING it in the scales of his hide. As he slices
down his chest, a RED GLOW issues from the wound. Not blood,
but LIGHT. The dragon reaches into the cut. Sighs. Groans.
And captures a PULSATING SCARLET BRILLIANCE in his claw, as
the wound closes over.

He holds the glowing orb over the boy. Einon's eyelids
flutter open. He smiles, as the beast gently reaches down
and the glowing redness seeps into Einon's wound.

DRAGON
Half my heart to make you whole. It's
strength to purify your weakness. Live
and remember your oath.

He pulls his claw back and a THIN SLIVER OF FIRE shoots from
the Dragon's nostril along the wound, cauterizing it. But
Einon feels no pain. He smiles and his eyelids grow heavy
and flutter down. Einon sleeps peacefully. Aislinn gasps a
joyous sob and hugs the sleeping boy. Bowen is dumbfounded.

Once more FLAME sprays from the Dragon, relighting the
terches, Aislinn rises and bows to the Dragon. She turns,
Bowen lifts Einon up in his arms, and, with their entourage,
they turn to leave. Bowen hesitates and turns to the dragon.

BOWEN
I've served the father only for the sake
of the son. In him go all the hopes of my
heart. Forgive a doubting fool. Call
when you've need of me, ask what you will
of me. My sword and service are yours.

The dragon has faded into the darkness. Only an occasional
shiny scale flickers.

DRAGON
Only remind him always of his vow, Knight
of the Old Code.
13
EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - ROMAN RUINS ~ ON CROWN - NIGHT

Bowen, on horseback, leads Aislinn's steed down the mountain
through the Roman ruins once more. Behind them comes Brok
and the guard with...

EINON. ..asleep on his stretcher, unconsciously fondling the
crown in his hands.

The crown slips from his fingers, clanking to the ground.
Einon jerks awake, sitting up bolt straight. A strange,
fierce light in his eyes. He's tense with coiled energy.
Brok signals the guard to halt and kneels beside Einon.

BROK
Your Majesty? Is all well?

Einon unconsciously feels the scar on his chest. Einon gazes
at it, remembering. The Dragon. He smiles at the memory.

EINON
All is very well. The crown.

Brok picks it up and offers it to Einon. Eyes afire, Einon
takes the crown and firmly plants it on his head. He likes
the fit.

BROK
Anything more, Your Majesty?

Einon turns from his regal reverie to smile grimly at Brok.

EINON
Much more.

He rises off the stretcher. Brok goes to support him, but
Einon pushes him away. He's a little rocky on his feet, but
he stands, staring out on the Roman ruins.

EINON
The Romans built a great castle here.
Mine will be greater.

BROK
It will take many men, milord, to rebuilt
this ruin.

EINON
Yes...

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - DAWN

THE SOLDIERS OF THE KING swarm through the burnt ruin of the
village. WAILING WOMEN and even SOME CHILDREN have been put
to work filling in the barricade ditch, THE VILLAGE MENFOLK
are being rounded up from hiding places and shackled in
WOODEN NECK STOCKS.
14

BROK, in charge of this foray, steers his horse through the
trampled shambles of a hut and scrapes away debris with his
sword, ferreting out a TRAPDOOR beneath the charred clutter.
He motions to TWO SOLDIERS who jerk open the door, exposing a
dishevelled REDBEARD hiding below in a root cellar full of
cheese.

Brok's sword jabs downward. Into a ROUND OF CHEESE. As Brok
takes a bite of the cheese, Redbeard is yanked out and herded
toward the other prisoners. Kara, working at the ditch,
drops her spade and rushes to him.

KARA
Father!

Tears in her eyes, she clings to him, but Brok yanks her
‘roughly by the hair and shoves her away. She falls to the
ground, rising up to see REDBEARD yoked into a stock with two
other prisoners.

EXT. STONE QUARRY - DAY

Firelight flickers over Einon's face. He sits his horse,
next to a SMITHY'S FIRE, savouring the SOUNDS OF CLINKING
CHAINS AND SPLINTERED STONE, as he gazes out over...

A STONE QUARRY...FETTERED PEASANTS break rocks under the
watchful eyes of ARMED GUARDS. Einon watches in malevolent
satisfaction as Brok rides in with a half dozen more QUARRY
SLAVES harnessed together with a length of rope about their
neck. Among them is REDBEARD.

EINON
Hold, Brok!

Brok stops his charges with a rough jerk on the rope. Einon
appraisies Redbeard suspiciously. Even in defeat, the big
man stares up at the new king with cold contempt. Einon
cannot match his stern gaze. Redbeard smiles.

REDBEARD
Come to thank me, boy? You should. It
was my stroke that made you king.

Brok yanks Redbeard's head back by his headband, exposing his
neck to his blade.

BROK
My stoke will make you a corpse!

EINON
No!

The command halts the throat-slitting. Einon glares at
Redbeard glaring at him.
15

EINON
I want no martyrs. And death is a
release, not punishment.

Einon smiles evilly at Redbeard whose glare hardens but also
flickers with faint worry.

EINON
It's an insolent gaze. Look good, dog.
And remember. I am your king. The one
who crushed you. And the last thing you
will ever see.

Einon grabs an iron from the smithy's fire. Its tip is
white-hot. He flings it to Brok.

EINON
Burn that insolence out of his eyes!

Grinning, Brok picks up the iron. Redbeard, pale but proud,
gazes up into the rocks. He shakes his head from side-to-
side, almost imperceptibly. To anyone observing, it would
merely seem dazed defiance or maybe trembling fear, but it
is, in actuality a signal. A signal to...

KARA...hidden up behind a boulder. Redbeard is warning the
girl to stay put. Stay safe. Weeping, Kara obeys as...

BROK...approaches Readbeard, head still high. Eyes still on
the rocks above. But as Brok raises the iron a SWORD BLADE
swoops down and strikes it from his hand. It is...

BOWEN'S SWORD...as he gallops past Brok to the prisoners, his
blade slicing the ropes binding them together.

BOWEN
Run!

No encouragement needed, the prisoners scatter for the
forest. Bowen's whirlwind appearance confuses Einon's men.
But one snaps out of it and tries to stop an escapee. Bowen
comes between them and cuts the soldier down. Meanwhile...

KARA...scrambles out of the rocks and, in the confusion,
rushes down to Redbeard.

KARA
Father!

REDBEARD
Kara! Quickly!

Einon spots the girl and charges after them, but once more,
Bowen rides between the pursuer and the pursued, who duck
into the woods. Enraged, Einon bears down on Bowen with drawn
sword. Bowen reluctantly but skillfully defends himself
against the attack.
 

16

EINON
How dare you defy me!
BOWEN
Einon! You're unwell! Bewitched!
(pleading)

Don't do this! Remember the code!

EINON
The king is above the code!

Dismayed by this declaration, Bowen drops his guard and Einon
unseats him with a stab in the shoulder. The knight topples
from his mount, falling between the skittish horses. Einon
rides over him, whirling triumphantly to acknowledge the
cheers of his men. His mistake...for...

A MUDDY HAND...reaches up and yanks Einon's leg from the
stirrup, shoving it out and up, heaving....

EINON...off his horse. The boy reels over the right flank of
his horse, flopping to the ground to find...

BOWEN...grimly grinning at him through the legs of the horse.

BOWEN
Only expose your back to a corpse. You
forget everything I've taught you!

Bowen, braced on his blade, bleeding from his shoulder and
his head, tries to stagger up.

Einon angrily leaps up and, whipping his horse away, lunges
at Bowen, still on his knees. But even kneeling, Bowen
deflects Einon's wild charge.

BOWEN
Control, little warrior!

His blade knocks Einon's aside, then rips across the dragon's
crest on the surcote. Bowen, still on his knees, counters
Einon's fierce but undisciplined, crazed sallies, critiquing
the boy's technique as he does.

BOWEN
Purpose, not passion, Einon. Fight with
your head...

He slashes Einon's belt. It slides down his legs and trips
him up. He lugges savagely atop the tottering Einon, forcing
him down, poistng his sword tip on the boy's heart.

BOWEN
».-not your heart.
17

The heart. His eyes smoldering with pained hurt, Bowen
spies the torn dragon on the surcote, which rises and falls,
along with his blade, in chaotic rhythm to Einon's racing
heart. The dragon's heart. The dragon. It's almost as
though he can hear the cursed heart beating. Thump. Thump.
Thump. Pulsing with treacherous life.

With a mad, griefstricken wail, Bowen raises his sword...and
jabs it in the ground beside Einon's head, staring at the boy
with sorrow-filled eyes. His voice rasps with choked
emotion.

BOWEN
No one is above the code. Least of all,
a king!

‘He leans down and kisses the boy. Tears well in his eyes as

he whirls up and sharply whistles. As Bowen's steed gallops
up, Einon scrambles away, grasping his cheek where Bowen
kissed him. His confused fear quickly turns to anger once
more as Bowen mounts and spurs his steed off into the forest.

EINON
Seize him! Bring him down!

EXT. STONE QUARRY - FOREST - DAY

Bowen gallops off through the sun-streaked trees. THE CAMERA
PANS UP TO:

KARA & REDBEARD..-.hiding in a tree, as Einon and his minions
ride in pursuit of Bowen.

EXT. CAVE - SUNSET

Bowen emerges from the dragon cave. In frustrated fury, he
clangs his drawn sword against the rock. His horse whinnies
nervously, as the shrieking clang echoes out over the
mountains where a shimmering half-orb of SUNLIGHT splays
across a purple-orange sky.

BOWEN
No matter where you fly, Dragon, no
matter where you hide, I will find you!
My oath will not save you! All bonds are
broke by your betrayal. I make a new
vow! I will undo your treachery!...Even
if I must spend the rest of my life
hunting you and your kind down!

In the distance, Bowen's echoing oath is answered by A
MOURNFUL TRILL...Every mountain seems to reverberate with the
tortured KEENING as the CAMERA PULLS BACK, capturing Bowen in
the golden flood of the sinking sun. WE HEAR A VOICE.
18
EXT. FELTON'S MILL - WHEAT FIELD - DAY

FRIAR GILBERT (VO)
This is the tale of a Knight who slew a
Dragon and vanquished Evil.

GOLDEN LIGHT overwhelms the screen as a SUPERIMPOSED LEGEND
APPEARS:

"TWELVE YEARS LATER"
The GOLDEN LIGHT becomes...

WHEAT...waving gently in the morning breeze. Behind the wall
of grain comes a VOICE...the same we just heard...reciting.

GILBERT'S VOICE
(reciting)
"A solitary pilgrim rode
Upon his lowly mule,..."

CAMERA PANS over the rolling hill of wheat, finding...

FRIAR GILBERT...a monk...riding a MULE on a path between the
wheatfields.

Both mule and monk are laden with scrolls and manuscripts.
Bundles of parchment protrude from the saddlebags. Slung
about the monk's middle is a clothsack filled with scrolls.

As Gilbert recites, he scratches a quill across a scroll
unrolled against the mule's neck.

GILBERT
(writing)
"Content with this his humble mode,
His quest was spiritual..."

Except it comes out"spirichool" as he tries to rhyme it with
mule. The mule itself begins to buck.

GILBERT
Whoa, Merlin! Whooaa!

But Merlin doesn't "whoa" and bucks Gilbert off, who tumbles
cassock over crucifix, the scrolls from his pouch spilling
out on the ground with him.. He sits up with as much dignity
as he can muster and glares at the mule.

GILBERT
Everyone's a critic.

But the mule's only response is to bray nervously and stomp
impatiently at the ground. Ignoring the tempermental animal,
Gilbert crawls about gathering up his scrolls, grumbling to
himself.
19

GILBERT
Keep faith, Gilbert, keep faith! True,
thus far, this quest has been uneventful
-.-if not altogether fruitless and boring
+..But remember its goals, its glory!
Soon, something's bound to happen.

Something does. A SUDDEN WHOOSH OF WIND violently rustles the
wheat and tears at the monk's cassock. The just~gathered
scrolls go flying from his grip once more and Gilbert goes
flat on his back once more. His eyes widening with fear as
they gaze upward, following the path of the wind.

GILBERT
D-D-Dragon!

‘The GUST OF WIND subsides and the RUSTLING OF WINGS whips
away over a hill of wheat which wavers violently in its wake.

Scrambling up, Gilbert scoops up precious scrolls as he tears
off for the opposite wheatfield. But he screeches to a
panicked halt as SOMETHING ELSE charges out of the wheat.

Wailing, the frenzied friar flings himself to the ground once
more in a welter of flying manuscripts.

GILBERT
(crosses himself)
Jesu!

Gilbert peeks up to see...

A KNIGHT...reining in his horse, frowning down at him. It is
BOWEN.

But Bowen is mightily changed since last we saw him. Time
has passed and not been kind. His hair is now laced with
grey. His face is unshaven. His surcote frayed and torn.
His armour dented and dull.

He and his steed are laden with assorted weaponry. Broad
sword, lance, bow and arrows, mace, battle axe, and buckler.
This SHIELD gives grim evidence of his trade...and that he
has been successful in his vow...an awesome assortment of
DRAGON HORNS protrudes from it.

Bowen snaps at the friar in curt irritation.

GILBERT
Dra...dra...drag...

BOWEN
Yes! Where?

Gilbert gestures with a bent scroll clutched in his shaking
hand. Bowen gives chase, he and his mount disappearing over
the hill of wheat.
20

A painful HOWL jerks the priest up, shivering. A BURST OF
FIRE erupts in the sky from over the hill. The stalks quiver
in manic agitation. SOMETHING'S coming toward him!

It's Bowen's riderless horse. Gilbert kneels in prayer.
He's interrupted by ANOTHER HORRIBLE YOWL! Then...

STILLNESS! Gilbert creeps to the wheat, listening. Nothing.
Then RUSTLING. Close by! A DRAGON HORN pokes through the
stalks. Gilbert falls back with a yelp. It's only...

BOWEN...holding a SEVERED DRAGON HORN.

Bowen goes to his horse and begins to affix his latest trophy
to his shield. Gilbert scrambles to his feet and, plucking
up scattered scrolls along the way, rushes to the knight.

GILBERT
(arms full of manuscripts)
Magnificent! Marvelous! Heroics
befitting the days of Arthur and the
Round Table, Never have I seen such

skill!

BOWEN
Then you must've led the life of a...
monk.

GILBERT

A...Yes...Also scholar, scribe,
historian, and poet. Your servant,
Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur. My
humble life is in the debt of your
exalted prowess, dauntless courage, and
superb, swift sword.

BOWEN
You have a poet's gift of exaggeration.

Gilbert thinks it's a compliment and holds up a scroll.

GILBERT
Oh, sir! You should read my histories.
But you belittle your talent. A great
victory for you and the Lord.

Bowen wearily examines the mottled, scarred horn.

BOWEN
Then may the Lord savour it. There's too
little glory to be shared in this kill.

GILBERT
Modesty as well as valour. The code of
ancient Camelot still lives.
21

Bowen jerks his head up with a hostile glare at the mention
of the code. Then the glare glazes into wistful sadness. He
shakes the melancholy from him with a sardonic grin.

BOWEN
Hardly worthy of Camelot...Still it's one
less dragon...

Bowen looks at the new horn and all the others on his shield
with bitter satisfaction. His grim rumination is interrupted
by CLATTERING HOOVES. An effete, oily lord, FELTON, rides up
with THREE BURLY MEN-AT-ARMS. Felton deigns to salute Bowen
with a bejewelled hand.

FELTON
Well done, Knight. Our gratitude. Mine
and King Einon's.

Felton yawns blasely. That's it. Interview's over. He
turns his horse to go, but Bowen catches the reins.

BOWEN
Keep the gratitude. I'll take gold.
Yours or the King's.

FELTON
Gold, knight?

Felton cocks an imperious eyebrow and smiles. Unpleasantly.
Bowen gets the picture. He's getting the shaft.

BOWEN
We struck a bargain. One dragon put
down, one pouch of gold.

Gilbert's idea of chivalry is dismayed by this mercenary
display.

GILBERT
Your honour has a price, knight?

BOWEN
It has expenses! Honour cannot fill my
belly or shoe my horse.
(wheels to Felton)
I ask no more than any man. A fair price
for a fair skill.

FELTON
The priest is right. It is your duty to
protect King Einon's vassals as a knight
of the realm!

BOWEN
Not of this realm! I bend no knee to
Einon.
22

FELTON
No? Then begone, vagabond, before I
arrest you for...for...
(an inspiration)
Poaching the king's wildlife!

Felton jerks a finger at the dead dragon. Bowen almost
laughs at the ludicrousness of it and he fingers his sword
hilt, debating whether to cut this popinjay down to size.

But the thugs-at-arms give Felton's threats weight. Bowen
grimly smiles and, with a curt bow, mounts up.

Suddenly, the timid faces of PEASANTS begin to poke out of
the wheat. Felton turns his disdain on them.

FELTON
Back to work you, lazy scum. If King
Einon's wheat isn't cut before the rain,
I'll do some cutting of my own.

Felton's bully-boys whip the peasants back to the fields.
Gilbert, who's watched all in befuddled confusion, grabs his
mule's reins and timidly approaches Bowen.

GILBERT
Forgive me, Sir knight, for questioning
your motives. Times are topsy-turvy and
the world is not as it once was.

BOWEN
I've noticed.

GILBERT
Let me make amends. I've a fair culinary
flair. Please join me in my evening

repast.

BOWEN
Come evening, I shall be far from here,
priest.

Gilbert mounts and the two head up the ridge.

GILBERT
So shall I. For I am on a pilgrimage.
Might we travel together?

BOWEN
Unless Einon's taxed it, the road's still
free and a man may travel which way he
chooses,

Bowen addresses this last to Felton as he passes by, who idly
ponders as he watches them go...
23
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE -ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

Einon's prediction was right. His castle is greater than the
Roman one. And it's not yet completed. But even behind a
WARREN OF SCAFFOLDING, it rises out of the spine of the
mountain impressive and forbidding. FELTON AND HIS RETINUE
come riding up the road in through the castle gates.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

The courtyard is abuzz with WORKMAN and SERVANTS. GROOMS
ATTEND to SADDLE HORSES. FALCONRY MASTERS stand with HOODED
BIRDS OF PREY perched on their gloves. There is RAUCOUS
LAUGHTER as A GROUP OF MEN move out of the shadow of a
portico, led by...

EINON...now in his twenties. Tall and tough. Eyes sharp.

Mouth cruel. Armed with sword, dagger, and quiver. He's
cultivated a wispy beard. He's followed by a COTERIE of
KNIGHTS, all dressed for the hunt, among them Brok and Felton
who buzzes in his ear.

FELTON (OS)
A road tax, King Einon.

Felton, weighted down with hunting equipment, trips on his
bow. Brok smirks at him. Felton cocks an imperious eyebrow
at Brok and turns to Einon who weighs Felton's suggestion as
he mounts a strong steed laden with armour and weapons like
himself. Felton fans the flame of his idea.

FELTON
They use it. Let them pay for the
privilege.

Again, he gets caught up in his bow. He untangles himself
and indignantly flings it to a nearby servant, finishing his
thought.

FELTON
And those that can't, can work it off!

All wait for Einon's response. It comes in a sly smile. He
leans over and pats Felton's balding head.

EINON
Ingenious, Lord Felton.

He plays with a wispy strand of thinning hair.
EINON
There may not be much on top, but there's
plenty underneath.

He playfully thumps a finger on Felton's skull. Felton makes
a sweeping bow.
24

As Felton comes up, Brok reaches in front of him and takes
his FALCON from an attendent, sweeping it close to Felton's
face. The bird screeches and flaps its wings, Felton cringes
back. Brok smirks.

BROK
He likes to bring down peacocks.

Shrinking back from Brok, Felton clambers on his horse, but
is so weighted down with his hunting paraphenalia, he has a
tough time swinging into the saddle.

Brok grabs him by the seat of the pants and roughly shoves
him up.

BROK
Fly, peacock, fly.

The others laugh as Felton clumsily grabs the horse's neck to
keep his balance. Once more, he comes face to face with
Brok's hawk that screeches again, eliciting more laughter
from Brok and the others...all but Einon.

EINON
Lord Brok. Some are good at hunting men.
Some are good at hunting money. Both
have value to me.

Felton's turn to smirk. But his triumph's shortlived as
Einon snatches Felton's bow from the attendent and tosses it
to the haughty fop.

EINON
So don't forget your bow, Felton, you may
need to shoot a ferocious coin purse.

Einon joins the others in their laughter this time. And so
does a reluctant Felton who gives forth with a forced giddy
giggle.

: EINON
To the hunt!

He spurs his horse out the gate, followed by his minions.

EXT. STONE QUARRY - DAY

Many are still working off debts to the young tyrant. Though
the quarry is all but gutted, half-starved ragged PEASANTS
toil in the sun under the watchful eyes of GUARDS.

Many of the QUARRY SLAVES clamor for water, doled out by...

KARA...Now grown into a beautiful woman. But both her beauty
and her lush, wild mane of red hair are hidden underneath a
ragged cloak. But her proud, youthful face cannot hide eyes
that are much older, weary with grim experience.
25

Dispensing drinks, she makes her way up behind AN OLD MAN
chipping at stone with a chisel and hammer. She scoops a
ladle of water out and proffers it to him. We recognize the
HEADBAND the old man wears.

KARA
Drink, Father.

The old man turns. It is REDBEARD! No longer a virile,
haughty rebel. Einon recaptured him and carried out his
threat. Redbeard is BLIND. Scar tissue surrounds the
sightless eyes staring at nothing.

But even though his red hair and beard are streaked with
white, even though his once-strong body is frail and stooped,

he still manages an air of his old defiance.

REDBEARD
I told you not to come here anymore,
Kara!

KARA

I am a disobediant child, Father. Drink.

REDBEARD
No longer a child. A woman. And it
takes no blind man to tell a beautiful
one.

His gnarled hand gropes for her face. She leads him to her
cheek. He caresses it.

RED-BEARD
One day on of these dogs will notice too.
Go home, Kara.

KARA
You are my home, Father.

She kisses his palm. Then takes some COOKED MEAT from her
jerkin and stuff it inside his shirt.

KARA
Here is meat for later. Now quickly,
drink. The guard is watching.

She places the LADLE in his hand and he starts to lift it to
his lips. Suddenly AN ARROW ZINGS INTO FRAME, striking the
ladle and knocking in from his hand. Kara wheels to
LAUGHTER. IT IS...

EINON...and his hunting party, laden down with game...
pheasant, boars, even a stag. Einon has shot the arrow.

FELTON
I don't believe...I mean, magnificent
shot, Your Higness.
26

EINON
And profitable. Unless you care to
double the wager, Felton?

FELTON
{takes the bet)
Through his legs!

Einon notches another arrow and lets fly at...

RED-BEARD...already panicked by the first arrow. He hears
the whizz of the second as it zips through his legs and
clinks on the rock behind him. He whirls frantically.

RED-BEARD
Kara!

KARA
Stand still, father!

Felton shouts out another target.

FELTON
The bucket-handle!

Another arrow slices the air, striking the water bucket
handle next to Red-beard and sending it clattering against
the bucket, causing the old man to jump.

RED~BEARD
Kara!

KARA
Don't move!

Kara steps in front of him and heads for...

EINON...indignant someone should interfere with his sport.
He notches another arrow and shoots it in front of Kara's
feet. She keeps coming. Another arrow. Only inches frm
her. She keeps coming. He aims directly at her. Not a
flinch. She keeps coming. Einon lowers his bow, intrigued.

EINON .
You've got nerve for a spoilsport.

KARA
There's no sport in tormenting a sick old
man. I beg Your Majesty. Let him go.
It's been fourteen years. Your castle is
budlt. He can do you no harm. For
pity's sake, release him.

Einon stares at her curiously. Then smiles.

Einon
Release him?
27

In one flashy blur of motion, he's notched another arrow and
sends it flying. Straight into Red-beard's heart. The old
Man gasps and staggers back against the rocks.

KARA
Father!

She runs to him, her hood flying back, unleasing her wild red
tumble of hair. It catches Einon's attention.

EINON
I've always said death was a release.

He spurs his horse and he and his flunkeys ride off as...
Kara...kneels beside her father.

RED-BEARD
K-K-Kara...

He goes limp and his head sags. His headband falls off and
his hair spills down over his blind eyes. Kara takes the
band and, in stunned grief, presses it to her face, sobbing
into it.

ON EINON

Turning on Kara's heartbroken wail. Her rich red hair is
captured in the burning light of the Smithy's fire behind
her. . The image strikes a memory with Einon, but he can't
bring it forth and shrugs it off with an uneasy shiver.

EXT. CAMPFIRE - DUSK

Bowen and Gilbert sit at a campfire, gnawing on roasted
mutton joints. As Bowen affixes his latest trophy to his
dragon-horn shield, Gilbert recites from a parchment,
spraying bits of half-chewed food in his bombastic style and
waving his mutton joint in time to his suspect meter and
dubious rhythm.

GILBERT
In Avalon, Lost Avalon, so the legends
say,
In mystery and mist, there valiant King
Arthur lay.
And resting with him, the brave, bold
heroes of his day.

Gilbert has risen and paces, carried off in the throes of his
overwrought rhyme. Bowen winces as the Priest starts his
third stanza off with a piercing, dramatic, declamatory wail.
28

GILBERT
Obhh, Avalon! Bright Avalon! The worried
world's astray!
Return forgotten glories that once held
noble sway,
And sweep the world's dank darkness away,
away, away! :

Gilbert glances at his audience in excited expectation!

GILBERT
What do you think?

BOWEN
Your mutton is very good...Avalon is a
fable, priest.

‘Ego ruffled, Gilbert rummages through his bag of scrolls.

GILBERT
A fable? That's uneducated piffle,
Bowen. JI can prove it. I have it right
here. Somewhere here.

(He can't find it)

But I remember it. "Upon his death, King
Arthur was taken to Avalon, a land of
mist, to lie among his brother knights in
a grove of stone upon a tor." Aha, here
it is!

He jerks out a scroll and unravels it, thrusting it out to

Bowen.

It's upside down. Gilbert twists it right side up.

GILBERT
From the venerable history of Gildas the
Scribe. Facts, my friend! Avalon is a
holy place. And my pilgrimage a sacred
duty. I will find it.

BOWEN
And when you do?

GILBERT
I'll pray to the souls of the sainted men
buried there...Arthur and all the knights
of Camelot.

BOWEN
But, you know, Brother Gilbert, it's said
not only Arthur lies at Avalon, but also
the Gateway to the Underworld. So take
care. The spirits you call may come.

He tosses his mutton bone into the fire and works on his

shield.
29

GILBERT
I wish they would and bring back the days
of chivalry and the Old Code.

BOWEN
No prayers can resurrect that pale
ghost...

Gilbert has caught the regret in Bowen's voice.

GILBERT
Ride with me, my son. All knights need a
quest. I think ours is the same.

BOWEN
Men of faith may follow a fable, priest.
But my only faith is my sword...And I
already have a quest.

GILBERT
What quest?
BOWEN
To slay all dragons...And one, in

particular...

Bowen's shield is finished, he holds up in the firelight to
inspect it. Gilbert's face lights up in awe and pleasure, as
though he's found the hero of his next epic poem.

EXT. WATERFALL - ON BOWEN - DAY

Bowen rides out of a dark forest into the light along the
bank of a shallow creekbed. As his horse steps into the
water, Bowen reins him up, leaning down in the saddle,
examining...

A DRAGON TRACK...impressed in the mud, visible through the
clear, rippling water.

Bowen glances up and smiles. A gentle WATERFALL spills over
an OVERHANG OF ROCK. His dragon will be there. Bowen jerks
up his lance and reins his steed toward the falls.

GILBERT (0S)
Yoo-hoo!

GILBERT..."hallooing" for attention, stands atop a clump of
rocks on the opposite bank.

Muttering an oath, Bowen rides over to Gilbert who plops his
literary bag on the rocks and rummages through it.

BOWEN
What are you doing here?

GILBERT
30

(pulls out ink)
How do you prefer I write this?

BOWEN
Far away.

Gilbert doesn't get it, chuckles, and fumbles in his bag.

GILBERT
Oh, please, don't concern yourself with
my safety. No, I meant style. Verse.
Meter. Shall I spice it up with a
poetical flourish or just the cold hard
facts?

Gilbert's voice booms out above even the rushing falls. He
‘unrolls some blank manuscript. Bowen seethes exasperatedly.

BOWEN
Ssssh! We'll be the only things cold and
hard around here if you don't shut up!

Bowen pokes his lance through the scroll, jerking it away.
Gilbert indignantly snatches it back.

GILBERT
That's a fine attitude. I come to
immortalize you and you try to muzzle the
mouth of chronicle, lop off the tongue of
truth. It's all very well to go about
hacking and whacking dragons, but if a
dragon falls in the forest and no one
hears about it, does it make a thud?!

Exasperated, Bowen starts to ride off. Gilbert squats down
on a rock still, preparing to write, still railing at Bowen.

GILBERT
You're nothing without the likes of me.
Heroics don't make heroes, ballad-makers
do. The quill is mightier than the swo..!

Suddenly, AN GIANT EYE opens up between Gilbert's legs,
Gilbert lays his parchment on the "rock" and scrawls across
it with his quill. The eye blinks in agitation and suddenly
the "rock" starts to shift and move.

GILBERT
+»-ord ...duh ...duh ...aah!

Gilbert falls from the shifting "rocks", tumbling down
toward...

BOWEN...crashes onto him, then over the horse's back,
splashing into the water. Bowen whirls back to the sound of
More splashing, just in time to see...
31

A DRAGON TAIL...slither along the creek, disappearing into
the waterfall. The "rock" on which Gilbert was perched has
also disappeared.

Bowen spurs his horse and charges for the falls. But he's
stopped by...

A BATTERED BREASTPLATE...flying out from the waterfall,
splashing in the stream in front of Bowen who steadies his
nervous steed.

DRAGON (0S)
That's what's left of the last fellow who
entered uninvited.

BOWEN
That doesn't frighten me.

DRAGON
No? How about this? Or this? or this?

A barrage of crumpled armour and bones careens out. Half of
it crashes into Gilbert, trying to rise out of the stream.
The monk scampers out of the debris and has barely got to his
feet when suddenly the complete skeleton of a horse and rider
comes jangling through the falls, clattering in a heap.

Their splash washes over Gilbert and sends him flopping back
into the stream. Bowen's horse whinnies and rears.

DRAGON
I could go on. I've quite a collection.

BOWEN
I won't be added to it.

Bowen thrusts his lance at the figure on the other side of
the fall. But the pike is yanked on from the other side of
the waterscreen and Bowen, still gripping it, is yanked along
with it. He spills from the saddle, somersaulting into the
creek.

A moment later, the two pieces of his broken lance shoot out
of the waterfall, the steel pointed end nearly impaling Bowen
as it jabs into the creekbed beside him.

ON GILBERT

Supine in the creek. Water spritzes from his mouth. He sits
up in time to see Bowen draw his sword and buckler and enter
into the cave through the waterfall.

Gilbert sees his canvas sack floating by, he snatches it up
and, rummaging for another quill and parchment, starts to
compose out loud.
32

GILBERT
Into the mouth of death he strode
Into the grimey gloom.
Into a pit of fear unknown,
Perhaps to court his doom,

A FLASH OF FLAME backlights the waterfall, followed by a
BLAST OF STEAM that rolls out from the falls, slamming
Gilbert back into the creekbed.

INT. WATERFALL CAVERN - ON FIRE - DAY

A BOLT OF FLAME deflects against Bowen's shield, sparks hiss
and smoke against the moist cavern floor. Bowen grins up at
the DRAGON -- A HULKING, HAZY SHADOW, in the smoky dark --
lurking on a shelf of rock above him. The Dragon does have
quite a collection. Bones and armour litter the place.

BOWEN
Little damp for fire, isn't it?

DRAGON
Why must you knight-errants out to make a
name for yourselves always pick on us
dragons?

BOWEN
I don't need a name...and I have a
collection of my own.

Bowen holds out his shield. The dragon horns glint ina
rainbow of sunlight prismed through the waterfall.

DRAGON
Oh! One who kills for money, are you?

BOWEN
It's honest enough work! Ridding the
country of you lot. One must earn a
living.

DRAGON
Yes...one must live. No way round then
but to have at it, since you seek profit
in this.

BOWEN
Don't flatter yourself. No profit this
time, purely pleasure.

Bowen draws his sword. The dragon's eyes widen in
recognition!

DRAGON'S POV - THE SWORD

---And the talon-scratched GROOVE in the blade.
33
BACK TO SCENE
The dragon eyes Bowen warily.
DRAGON
Perhaps less pleasurable and more costly

than you think.

Bowen's mouth drops as the Dragon swoops off the ledge.

EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

The Dragon swoops out of the waterfall in a GUSH OF WIND AND
WATER. Spreading out his magnificent wings to their full
extension, he sweeps up over a startled Gilbert. Patches of
-his hide glisten irridescently. An awesome, glorious
creature.

EXT. WATERFALL - CRANE SHOT ABOVE GILBERT - DAY

Gilbert, craning back to gaze at the creature in dropped-
jawed amazement, gets smaller and smaller as the dragon
circles higher and higher in the sky. Gilbert, leaning back
a little too far, flops back into the water.

EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

BOWEN...dashes out of the falls and onto his horse. Gilbert,
just rising, ducks for cover in the water again as the knight
gallops past him into the woods after the dragon.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Bowen races through the trees.

EXT. WOODS - SKY - DAY

The Dragon skims the treetops.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Bowen, at full gallop, places his reins in his teeth, and
yanks a set of KNOTTED STRINGS from his saddle pommel.

The flaps of his saddle-bags pop open. A BOLO-CHAIN
catapults out, shoots skyward.
EXT. WATERFALL - SKY ABOVE - DAY

The chains BOLOS spread and widen as they spin up.
34
EXT. WOODS - DRAGON - DAY

The Dragon looks back to see the Bolos ensnare one of his
hind legs.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

In Bulldog fashion, Bowen wraps the chain around his saddle
horn, continuing to keep pace with the Dragon above.

Then the saddle harness snaps...and both saddle and Bowen,
still grasping the chain, are dragged across the ground as...

EXT. WOODS ~ SKY ABOVE - DAY

The dragon lunges through the sky.

EXT. WOODS - ON BOWEN - DAY

Clutching the chain for dear dear, still in the saddle,
careening through the underbrush, sometimes dragging on the
ground sometimes, whirling in the air, clanking stones and
trees. Birds and small animals scurry from thickets. He
avoids a near-collision with a tree as the Dragon suddenly
veers his course, taking Bowen straight into the path of...

ANOTHER TREE...with a dead log leaning against it. Both
Bowen and the saddle ride up the log. Bowen leaps from the
saddle running up the leaning log as he sees the chain thread
through the forked branches of a tree. Grabbing the saddle,
Bowen wedges it in the fork.

It works. For a moment. Then the Dragon's momentum
partially uproots the tree, causing Bowen to leap from the
jostled dead log which comes careening down behind him. He
tumbles and rolls and the tree just misses him. He peeks
over over the trunk to see...

EXT. WOODS - SKY - DAY

A BLUR OF DRAGON, at the end of its snared chain, plummet
downward behind a clump of trees. There is a CRASH as the
air fills with dust and dirt and broken tree limbs.

EXT. WOODS - GILBERT - DAY

Gilbert, on Merlin, rides in pursuit of the duel, composing
as he goes, voice vibrating, ink slopping all over the place.
 

35

GILBERT
The sword against the fang and claw
The flame against the shield.
The man, the beast, which would win?
Ahhhh!

The scream is because his ink has spilt all over the
manuscript, obliterating it.

EXT. WOODS ~ BOWEN - DAY

Bowen staggers up, dazed and dizzy, and starts to follow the
trail of chain. up over the ridge where the dragon crash-
landed.

No sooner has he disappeared than Gilbert arrives, mumbling
to himself trying to re-capture his poem as he ties Merlin
up.

GILBERT
Blahblah Sword...fang and claw
-..Flame against...shield...
Blah, blah, blah, which would win?
Unhh...shield, field, wield,
peeled...Aha!
Whose bones would flesh be peeled? Eww!

Making a face at the line, he grabs more quills, manuscript,
and ink.

GILBERT
No, no...Whose fate would soon be sealed!

He likes the line. Smiling, he scurries over the ridge to
find...

EXT. WOODS - GLADE - DAY

Bowen, sword drawn, charging down into a small clearing where
the Dragon, snarls and snaps, struggling to untangle the bolo
from his ankle.

BOWEN
Fleeing from an honourable challenge?
What manner of Dragon, are you?

DRAGON
You won't live long enough to find out!

The dragon's tail flanges out with sharp surrated edges and
swipes at Bowen. Bowen blocks the blow with his blade, but
nearly loses his balance. Again, the tail strikes, smashing
against his shield.

Again, the tail flails out. Too close. Bowen ducks just in
time as the tail slices a tree behind him in half.
36

BOWEN
You're good. Haven't had this sort of
challenge in some time.

DRAGON
Nor likely to again.

Bowen has rolled for cover behind a thick log. The dragon's
tail follows him, chopping huge chunks out of the log as
though slicing celery.

Bowen rolls to the end of the log, inches ahead of the
carving tail which suddenly bites a little too deep and gets
wedged in the trunk of the log.

The dragon shakes his tail, trying to get it loose, bouncing

-the log up and down. Realizing, the Dragon's tail is out of

comission, Bowen springs up, grinning.

BOWEN
Over-confident, aren't we?
DRAGON
Hardly, but if you win, you'll be out of

work.

Bowen approaches cautiously as the Dragon manuevurs to
confront his enemy.

BOWEN
Ha! I'11 keep on till I've exterminated
every last one of you.

DRAGON
I am the last one.

Bowen stops dead in his tracks. And lets down his guard...as
the Dragon snorts a FIREBALL from his nostril. Bowen leaps
back as the fire explodes against the tree.

BOWEN
You're just trying to save your scaly
hide with tricks.

Bowen ducks as another fireball strikes behind him.

DRAGON
Haven't you noticed pickings rather slim
of late?

They have been. And Bowen realizes it. But as he cautiously
edges in toward the dragon, he brazenly taps the latest
addition on his dragon-horn shield.

BOWEN
I got this one just the other day.
37

DRAGON
So you killed the Scarred One? He and I
were the last. Must have been a proud
kill, warrior. How much gold did his
toothless, tattered carcass put in your
purse?

BOWEN
What business is it of yours?

The Dragon's taunts rankle Bowen, which is just what the
Dragon wants. For he notices Bowen is stepping very near the
chain still attached to the Dragon's foot.

DRAGON
Couldn't have been much. And you'll kill
me for sport. And when there are no more
dragons to slay, how will you make your
way, knight?

BOWEN
Shut up, you!

Bowen raises his blade to strike, but as he does he straddles
the chain. The Dragon pulls back his foot, the chain snaps
up and catches Bowen mid-crotch. Bowen goes tumbling, losing
his shield.

The Dragon rears up, opening his jaws. AND OPENING! They
DISTEND like a snake's, stretching inordinately wide as sharp
eyeteeth fangs suddenly spring out...

ON GILBERT

Who screeches and cover his eyes.

ON BOWEN

Watching as the the black maw of the Dragon descends on hin.
ALL BECOMES BLACKNESS, until...

GILBERT
«.-Uncovers his eyes, expecting the worst. It isn't...
GILBERT'S POV - DRAGON & BOWEN

Bowen lies in the dragon's jaws, his sword tip tickling the
Dragon's palette. And no one's moving.

BOWEN
If your teeth come down, my sword goes
up. Right into your brain!

DISSOLVE TO:
38
EXT. WOODS - GILBERT'S POV - NIGHT
They're still not moving. Still in the same positions. The

dragon's unhinged jaws still stretched to their aching
maximum. Bowen tries to discreetly sneak his blade up.

DRAGON

GILBERT
(scribbling)
Till moonlit night, the titans duelled.

Oh, who'd the fatal falter make, Whose blood

Gilbert's quill slides off the parchment as his head flops
down on it and he falls asleep, his mouth agape in mid-yawn.

INT. DRAGON'S MOUTH ~ NIGHT

Bowen. crouches uncomfortably inside the mouth, propping his
sword arm up with his other hand, staring up at the fangs.

He notices a PIECE OF CLOTH stuck between the back teeth.
Bowen gives it a tug. It's a sleeve...with a SKELETAL HAND
still in it. Bowen recognizes the ring on the bony finger
and drops it.

BOWEN
Good Lord, Sir Eglamore!

EXT. WOODS - GLADE - ON DRAGON & BOWEN - NIGHT
Bowen throws the hand away in disgust.

DRAGON
Thanffs! Been stug ufp dere fa monffs!

Why should you be comfortable? My armour
is rusting in your drool. And your
breath is absolutely foul!

DRAGON

39

Suddenly, the dragon starts to cough. Hacking rumbles roll
up his throat. Bowen, rocking on the tongue, winces at the
smell of the breath.

BOWEN
Hey!

INT. DRAGON'S MOUTH - NIGHT

A HUGE BALL OF SALIVA rolls up the Dragon's throat and smacks
Bowen in the face. He wipes off, growling.

BOWEN
Watch it!

DRAGON
Sorry! Seems we'rr in a bid ab a
stalemade, wuudn't you thay?

BOWEN
(not giving an inch)
But I can go three days without sleep.

DRAGON
I can go fhree weegs.

This rattles Bowen's confidence, but he rebounds.

BOWEN
I'll stab you before I nod off.

EXT. WOODS - GLADE - ON BOWEN & DRAGON ~- NIGHT
The Dragon, jaws aching, eyes rolling, is peeved.

DRAGON

BOWEN
What do you suggest?

DRAGON
A troose! Ged out aff ma mouf and led's

More than happy to leave, Bowen starts to edge downward off
the tongue, but before he pulls his sword away he has second
thoughts.

BOWEN
How do I know I can trust you?

DRAGON
I gib you ma word!
40
BOWEN
A dragon's word is worthless.
INT. DRAGON'S MOUTH - NIGHT

The dragon's tongue flaps up with an exasperated snarl,
jostling the precarious perched Bowen.

DRAGON
Stubborn lout!

The dragon suddenly arches his tongue up and Bowen slides off
his slippery perch...falling out of the Dragon's mouth.

-EXT. WOODS - GLADE - NIGHT

Bowen plops from dragon's mouth onto the ground, his sword
clattering nearby. He looks up as a scaly paw clamps down on
him, pinning him in place. The Dragon cranes his neck down,
his eyes searing into Bowen.

BOWEN
I should have known. Go on! Kill me}

DRAGON
I don't want to kill you! Never did!
(quietly;solemnly)
And I don't want you to kill me...
(savagely)
How do we gain? If you win, you lose a
trade. If I win, I wait around for the
next swordslinger thirsting to carve a
reputation out of my hide...
(laments)
I'm tired of lurking in holes and
skulking in darkness! My life may be
miserable, but I must not di...!

He mysteriously stops, the thought unfinished.

DRAGON
Now if you insist, we can pursue this
fracas to its final stupidity. or you
can listen to my alternative.

The Dragon releases Bowen. Perplexed but suspicious, he
staggers to his feet, reeling for his sword. He's exhausted
and the sword is too heavy to lift. He can barely turn back
to see if the dragon is coming in for a sneak attack.

But there is no attack, The Dragon hasn't moved. He too is
spent and sags to ground with a heaving sigh, gazing at Bowen
with disappointed eyes.

Bowen drops to the ground too. He's tired...and curious.
41

BOWEN
What alternative?

EXT. THE WOODS - ON GILBERT - DAWN

The rosy rays of dawn filter through the forest foliage.
Birds twitter. Crickets chirp. And someone snores.
Gilbert. Still face down on his epic poem.

A PINE CONE falls from above, thudding on his rump. Gilbert
snorts, stirs, and rises, his face smeared with ink. He
tries to decipher his equally blotched parchment. Then he
remembers and, staggering to his feet, panics.

GILBERT
Bowen!

He scans the area. Nothing. No signs of victory or deafeat.
Or even that a battle had taken place.

Gilbert spies something in a bush. He gingerly plucks it up.
It's a SLEEVE. A BONY HAND slips from it. Yes... the late
Sir Eglamour. But Gilbert jumps to the wrong conclusion.

GILBERT
Oh, dear. Poor chap. Picked clean.

Gilbert crosses himself and, sadly looking at the ink-
blotched manuscript in his hand, crumples it up.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - MILL - DAY

SEVERAL PEASANTS manually turn a LARGE GRINDING WHEEL around
a flat mill stone under the supervision of Felton's BULLY-
BOYS, OTHER PEASANTS nearby thrash the wheat. STILL OTHERS
collect the milled flour.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY

SCAFFOLDING and ACTIVITY surround Felton's stone manor house.
As MASONS measure and trim and CARPENTERS pound, A PRETTY
LITTLE MINX with tousled hair langourously leans in the
doorway, lacing up her undone doublet.

A HAND reaches over her shoulder and slides a money pouch
down into her ample cleavage. She smiles up to find...

FELTON...smiling back, his own jerkin undone, holding up his
pants in one hand. With the other, he leads the girl back
into the house. CAMERA PANS UP TO:

THE WORKERS...on the scaffolding. It overlooks the
wheatfield, where labourers are harvesting the wheat.
42
EXT. FELTON'S MILL - WHEATFIELD - DAY
As the peasants harvest the crop, A YOUNG BOY looms INTO
FRAME, staring wide-eyed up at the sky and...
EXT. FELTON'S MILL - SKY ABOVE FIELD — DAY

---the Dragon suddenly swoops down PAST CAMERA.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - ABOVE WHEATFIELD ~ DAY

The boy turntails and runs, frantically waving his arms at
the others and yelling.

BOY
Dragon! Dragon!

The workers looks up and then scatter to safety.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - SKY ABOVE FIELD - DAY

The dragon dive-bombs the wheat, loosing TWO STREAMS OF FLAME
through the now-empty field.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - WHEATFIELD - ON PEASANTS - DAY

The peasants flee from the fire behind and the billowing
black cloud of smoke.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - SKY ABOVE FIELD - DAY

The Dragon sweeps through the column of smoke, causing a huge
vortex, winging his way to...

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - MILL - DAY

++-the Mill. The workers, spying the dragon, abandon their
post. A BULLY-BOY grabs a whip and starts after them, but a
sudden wind blows chaff into his face. He swats it away in
time to see...

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - SKY - DAY

The dragon takes aim at the mill and...shoots TWO FIRE BALLS
from his nostrils.
43
EXT. FELTON'S MILL - MILL - DAY

The Mill explodes. The Dragon swoops through the burning
wreckage. The dazed bully-boy watches him go. He hears a
CREAKING behind him and turns. The MILL WHEEL teeters
unsteadily on the stone.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY

There are cries and smoke and people dashing to and fro.
Felton, jerkin undone, holding up his unbelted pants, rushes
out of the house, his dishevelled Minx behind him. He's
aghast at the chaos, then hears a voice behind hin.

BOWEN (0S)
Pesky critters, dragons...

Felton whirls to see Bowen, ahorse, armed to the teeth.

BOWEN
...like big rodents. You never seem to
get rid of them...

Felton loses a grip on his pants. They fall to his ankles.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY (LATER)
Felton, still holding up his pants, dickers hotly with Bowen.

FELTON
Thievery! Gouging!

BOWEN
You owe me from last time and I want that
in advance too!

The Minx strokes Bowen's horse and smiles coyly at the
knight. Bowen smiles back and winks.

FELTON
I won't pay it!

He gestures emphatically with his arms. And his pants fall
down again. As he leans over to pick them up, the MILL WHEEL
suddenly rolls past him. Felton jerks up. And his pants go
down again as he, Bowen, the Minx, and the horse all turn
their heads and watch the twirling juggernaut collides
into...

THE SCAFFOLDING...sending stone, wood, and workers flying.
Felton stares at his damaged house. Then at Bowen. Then at
the Minx. He grabs the drawstring dangling from the Minx's
cleavage and yanks out the MONEY PURSE he gave her earlier.
He flings it at Bowen with a disgruntled gesture...and, once
more, his pants fall down.
44
EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY (LATER)
PEASANTS line the walls and yard of the manor house. Felton,
pants secure, sits in a chair in the front of the crowd,
flanked by his Bulley-boys, with the Minx at his feet.
Everyone is staring at...
EXT. FELTON'S MILL ~- LAKE - DAY
+..a harvested wheatfield at the edge of a LAKE. Bowen is
manuevering an OX towing a CART OF BOULDERS. He brings the
ox to a halt.
The cart is ballast, attached via ropes and pulleys to a
CATAPULT CONTRAPTION called "A WHACKER". Bowen goes to an
adjustable TRIPOD and loads it with a heavy HARPOON.
Calculating and adjusting, Bowen sights...
THE DRAGON...who comes sweeping into view.

BOWEN...slices the ROPE-TRIGGER with his sword and...

EXT, FELTON'S MILL - LAKE - DRAGON'S POV — DAY

.+.the HARPOON shoots from its cradle and zooms up toward its
target.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - SKY ABOVE LAKE ~ DAY

The Dragon skillfully positions himself to take the harpoon
under his wing where his claw clamps shut on the shaft,
catching it in mid-flight. But to...

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY

THE CROWD and FELTON...it looks like Bowen's scored a direct
hit. An impression helped immeasurably by Dragon's
spectacular, if overwrought, death scene.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - ON DRAGON - DAY

The Dragon gasps a yelp, does mid-air pirouette, a twisting
half-gainer, and then a death-throe spin captured in SLOW-
MOTION, before he does a final spiral tha sends him
plummetting below the surface of the lake.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - STONE HOUSE - DAY

The crowd breaks into raucous cheers as the dragon hits the
surface. All but Felton who turns to his Thugs.
45

FELTON
Get my money back.

They start down the hill,

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - LAKE - DAY

Bowen's foreseen this. He gives a shrill whistle. Bowen's
horse, awaiting cue, emerges from behind a haystack and as it
gallops past, Bowen swings in the saddle and rides off...

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - MILL - DAY

---toward the still~burning mill, laughing, jingling the

Money pouch in a nose-thumbing taunt as he chokes the Thugs

on his dust.

EXT. FELTON'S MILL - THE LAKE - AERIAL VIEW - DAY
Under the crystal surface of the lake, THE CAMERA PICKS UP...

THE DRAGON...gracefully swimming along, leaving in its wake a
stream of bubbles from his nostrils.

EXT. THE LAKE - FURTHER BANK - DAY

As the Dragon stealthily creeps onto the bank from the lake,
he hears a "BAAA!".

A FLOCK OF SHEEP...graze by the bank. The Dragon's eyes
gleam as his tongue flicks hungrily across his lips.

DRAGON
Hellooo...

EXT. GRASSLANDS - DAY

Bowen rides across a grassy steppe, counting the day's take.
Suddenly the dragon floats by him in the air, belly up, his
wings flapping idly as he circles Bowen and tries to blow a
patch of wool from the corner of his mouth.

BOWEN
Most profitable. I should have met you
long ago, Dragon.

DRAGON
There is much gold in the world. When
you have your fill of it and no longer
need me...

BOWEN
I am a Knight of the Old Code. My word
is my bond.
46

DRAGON
No compunctions then?
BOWEN
About what?
DRAGON
Well, such deception hardly befits a...
(emphasizing)

.--Knight of the Old Code...

Dragon finally knocks the wool off his mouth with his paw.
Rankled, Bowen angrily snatches it out of the air, wheeling
on the Dragon who's not longer there as he keeps idly
circling Bowen. Bowen whips his head back to the Dragon now

-on his other side.

BOWEN
That's debatable! Fleecing Einon's
lordly lackeys is a service to mankind.

DRAGON
Is it? When you squeeze the nobility,
it's the peasants who feel the pinch.

The Dragon's hit a sore spot and Bowen surily tries to
deflect the blow.

BOWEN
Not my concern. Why stick my neck out
for people afraid to risk their own?
Don't clutter up a clever scheme with
dubious morality. And stand still! I'm
getting dizzy!

The Dragon surreptitiously studies Bowen's vehement reaction
with interest. He stops circling and lights.

DRAGON
So be it...
(emphasizing)
Knight of the Old Code.

The dragon strides along beside Bowen's horse.

BOWEN
(hotly)
If I wanted my conscience pricked, I'd
have stayed with the priest. And what
does a dragon know of the Old Code,
anyway?

DRAGON

(quotes)
"His blade defends the helpless. His

might upholds the weak..."
47

BOWEN
Stop it! I remember the words. And
that's all it is! A memory. Dead and
gone. And nothing...nothing... can bring
it back.

Bowen, voice thick with emotion, turns from the Dragon.

DRAGON
You sound like one who tried...

BOWEN
And failed...So I no longer try to change
the world, Dragon, but try merely to get
by in it.

DRAGON
Yes, it's better than death, I suppose...

BOWEN
Is it?

It comes out too bitter...Bowen self-consciously shifts tone.

BOWEN
.»--For you, I mean. I should think you'd
welcome death. The last of your race.
All your friends dead. Hated and hunted
wherever you go...

DRAGON
Do you delight in reminding me? Yes,
Knight, I long for death...but fear it.

BOWEN
Why? Aside from your misery, what's to
lose?

DRAGON
My soul.

The two disappear over a dip in the road.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

Einon's castle looks even more forbidding at night. RAUCOUS
LAUGHTER ECHOES from within its towering walls.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

A ROASTED PIG twirls on a spit over an open fire. SERVANTS
with food and drink, hustle about to serve...

EINON & HIS KNIGHTS...and THEIR ROWDY WOMENFOLK, dining
alfresco by torchlight. Einon sits at the head of a huge
BANQUET TABLE, drunkenly laughing as he watches...
48

SIR BROK...bare-chested, atop the table, wrestle TWO MEN at
once. Brok tosses one over his shoulder and off the table
into the bonfire. With a yelp, the wrestler rolls on the
ground and servants obliging beat the flames off him.

The lords and their "ladies" roar with approval and urge Brok
on. Brok slings his opponent down the length of the table,
sending food and crockery flying. The wrestler slides past
the howling, drunken crowd to the end of the table where his
head flops over the edge as he groans and passes out, his
rolled eyes blaring vacantly up at...

AISLINN...primly seated at the table end, the only point of
stillness in this rowdy revelry. Weary despair, not age, has
faded her beauty. Einon shouts down the table at her.

EINON
Can he continue, Mother?

Aislinn lifts the unconscious man's arm off her plate by its
sleeve in dainty disgust, dropping it contemptuously over the
edge of the table.

AISLINN
The field is Sir Brok's, my son.

Brok does a victory dance on the table to the delighted roar
of the crowd, while Einon spins to Felton beside him.

Nestled drunkenly in Felton's arms is his PRETTY LITTLE MINX.
Purses and STACKS OF COINS litter the table. Einon scoops
two stacks from Felton's pile to his.

EINON
Twenty you owe me, Felton!

Felton starts to feebly protest.

AISLINN
Ten...my son.

The correction is spoken in flat calm. Einon frowns at his
mother, then at Felton whose Pretty Little Minx has started
to slide one of the stacks back. Felton smiles uneasily at
the displeased king and, slapping away Minx's hand from the
coins, scoots them back to Einon's pile.

FELTON
The spectacle of Sir Brok's prowess is
worth double the wager, sire!

Einon, reeling up, snatches a PITCHER to pour more wine.
It's empty. He bangs it on the table.

EINON
More wine!
49

Suddenly, in the polished sheen of the pitcher's metal, Einon
catches something.

EINON'S POV - THE PITCHER - NIGHT

Reflected in the pitcher, he sees a FIGURE, ARMED WITH A
KNIFE, CREEPING DOWN THE LOW ROOFTOP, DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM.

BACK TO SCENE
As Einon once more bangs the pitcher on the table.

EINON
Wine! The King's thirst must be
quenched!

Suddenly, from off the rooftop THE FIGURE comes flying. But
Einon's timing is perfect. He ducks and the attacker goes
flying over him, sprawling onto the table amid the feast and
screams of the stunned women. Einon is atop the body in an
instant, spinning it over, and wrenching the knife from the
grasp of...

KARA...who struggles in Einon's grasp, her red hair flying.
A half-dozen swords fly out, ready to stab her to death.

EINON
No!

The blades stop. Einon's sobering gaze intently scrutinizes
the girl. About her neck, she wears her father's headband.
Once more her flame hair glows against the fire-light jarring
an elusive memory for Einon.

EINON
I know...you...
(recognition hits)
The quarry! The blind dog's whelp!
(laughs)
Family devotion! A fine thing! Isn't
it, mother?

Only Aislinn's sad eyes respond to his sneering question...or
accusation, they are filled with quiet admiration for the
girl. Einon turns his sneer on Kara once more.

EINON
First you beg mercy for his fate. Then
try to avenge it. And now you'll share
it.
But it's said with fleeing conviction, even as Einon's sneer

flees...for he's become aware of her beauty.

KARA
In your kingdom, Einon, there are worse
fates than death.
50
The sneer is back.

EINON
Itll think up one for you! Lock her up!

Brok and others haul her away. Einon picks up the dagger
then gazes at his mother, watching him in inscrutable
silence.

EINON
Where's my wine!

He jabs the dagger into a hunk of meat and tears off a bite
with his teeth.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - KARA'S DAGGER - DAY

Kara's dagger furiously chops at a wooden branch. CAMERA
BACK on Einon, dressed in an open jerkin, on the battlements
amid the work rubble of renovation.

Einon idly chops at a piece of scaffolding with Kara's knife,
mesmerized by the glow of...

THE FORGE...fiery hot. Sweaty bodies toil over it, hammering
out hinges and bars. Other workers scuttle about, banging
and sawing in counterpoint to...

EINON'S VIOLENT WHITTLING...As he watches, the noise seems to
get louder in his head, swirling and jarring, TRANSFORMING
INTO OTHER SOUNDS...SOUNDS OF BATTLE...clanking metal and
clashing arms! Suddenly, Einon's eyes spark with ferocious
light. He charges down a stairway.

INT. EINON'S CASTLE ~- STAIRWAY - DAY

Einon flies down a flight of stone steps.

EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Einon stalks through the courtyard with determined purpose,
bolting into a grated doorway.

INT. DUNGEON ~ DAY

Einon barges into the dungeon, startling Kara, chained to the
wall. His intense gaze is unnerving. He idly strokes his
chest with the knife. As he presses into her, he slides the
blade from the folds of his shirt and caresses her throat
with it.

EINON
I remember now...
51

He rips open her blouse with the dagger. She gasps as he
slides the blade along her chest. Over her jerking heart.
He flips aside the torn flaps of the garment to peer at her
breasts.

EINON
XY remember...
INT. BEDCHAMBER ~ EINON'S CASTLE - ON KARA - SUNSET
Kara, in a simple shift, lies amidst the rumpled coverlets of
a bed. The unspilt tears in her eyes glisten in the candle-

glow of a nearby sconce.

Einon sits on the edge of the bed, his jerkin open and loose.

‘He sneers in amused contempt as her first tear falls.

EINON
(drunkenly)
You weep? You could be on the battle-
ments as buzzard bait rather than in the
royal bed. Rebels must learn to love
their king.

He lurches up and weaves to the nightstand where he refills
his wine cup. Kara spies his discarded belt on the floor

+--and her dagger tucked in jit.

EXT. PLATEAU - ON DAGGER - SUNSET

A dagger plunges down...against a flint. CAMERA BACK. Bowen
and the Dragon camp in a canyon. A plucked bird is skewered
ona spit. Bowen tries to start a fire with a flint. The
Dragon watches in amusement. Flame snorts from his nostrils
and the campfire's ablaze. So's the bird. Bowen nods a
dubious thanks as the Dragon wipes the black rings from his
nostrils with a sniff.

DRAGON
Hope you like it well done.

Bowen jerks the spit from the fire, beats the flames off the
bird, and eats. Firelight flickers over the shiny horns on
Bowen's shield. Bowen notices the Dragon staring at them.

DRAGON
Did you hate us so much?

BOWEN
I hated one of you.
(refers to shield)
These I killed, because I wanted to kill
him. But never found him. Never shall.
If you are the last, he must be dead.
52

DRAGON
Yes..What was he like? This Dragon you
hated.

BOWEN

He had only half a heart. But even one
half held enough evil to pollute an
innocent.

Dragon, forgetting himself, rises up, hotly.

DRAGON
Einon was no innocent! He polluted the
heart!

Now Bowen rises. The pair stare wildly at each other...Bowen
surprised the Dragon knows this history...The Dragon worried
he might have tipped his hand.

BOWEN
So you know the story, Dragon?

DRAGON
All Dragons knew it! What was to be
their hope became their doom. A spoiled,
ungrateful child was given a great gift
and destroyed it!

The words cut through Bowen, prodding the suspicion he has
always held...and never wanted to confront.

BOWEN
No! I knew that boy. Taught hin.
Taught him the ways of honour and right.
The Old Code.

DRAGON
Then he betrayed you, even as he betrayed
the dragon whose heart he broke!

BOWEN
That's a lie, Dragon!

DRAGON
Stop calling me dragon! I have a name!

BOWEN
What is it then, Dragon?

This breaks the tension. The Dragon shrugs sheepishly.
DRAGON

Well...uh...you couldn't possibly
pronounce it in your tongue.
53

Bowen turns away in exasperated disgust, flinging his bird
into the fire. Behind him the Dragon suddenly clutches at
his shoulder and staggers in pain. A RED GLOW PULSATES

BENEATH THE SKIN OF HIS AILING SHOULDER. THE DRAGON MOANS.

DRAGON
Arr...er...awwrr.

BOWEN
You're right. I couldn't pronounce it...

Again, the Dragon moans and Bowen realizes he wasn't getting
a language lesson. This language is universal -- PAIN! He
wheels to see the Dragon fall, wincing to the ground.

‘INT. EINON'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - ON WINE CUP - NIGHT

Einon's wine cup rolls on the floor, the wine seeping across
the stones like blood. CAMERA UP. Einon, a startled glaze
in his eyes, slumps against the wall. HIS DAGGER is buried
hilt deep in his left shoulder. Kara glares at him.

KARA
A love dart from Cupid, Einon!

Einon jerks up, wrenching the blade from his jerkin sleeve,
which he cuts open, exposing the wound...A thin line of blood
trickles from his shoulder, but the wound is surprisingly
slight. Einon laughs, wiping at the blood and sucking it
from his finger.

KARA
No!

EINON
Not as deep or deadly as you thought?
Next time stab more flesh, less cloth.

KARA
Next time I'll pierce your heart!

He grabs her arm and throws her on the bed, hovering over
her, pulling close.

EINON
You already did, sweet, in more ways than
one. A very special heart. Like no other.

He places her hand against his chest. She yanks it back.

KARA
A black withered thing devoid of pity.

Einon brings the knife to her throat. But as he gazes at her
lovely face twisted in hate for him, he calms, caressing her

with the dagger, wiping his blood on her cheek. In his eyes

is a pathetic perverse look of pain.
54

EINON
Then teach me. Pity me... Everything. I
would give you everything. Even power.
You are so...beautiful.

Knife still against her cheek, he kisses her reluctant lips
in awkward tenderness. As she pulls back, he shoves her on
the bed and sticks the knife in the bedpost. Kara glares up
and sees...

HIS WOUND...is almost ENTIRELY HEALED. As though she only
scratched him!

EINON
Even power...even a throne...

‘He staggers drunkenly from the room. Kara fights back fresh

tears, her hands scraping down her body as though trying to
rub his foul touch from her. In manic fury, she rips the
covers from the bed, then collapses on it, tears flooding.

EXT. CANYON - ON DRAGON - NIGHT

Firelight reflects across his face as...

BOWEN...concern etched in his face, uses a wet saddle blanket
as a compress for the Dragon's shoulder, still glowing hot.

STEAM puffs up in a SIZZLING HISS as Bowen places the blanket
over the wound and the glow subsides.

DRAGON
Thank you. It's passed now.
BOWEN
What was it?
DRAGON
An old complaint that acts up now and
again...
BOWEN

Forgive me if anything I said...If I
upset you...

DRAGON
It wasn't you...not you...

INT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

Kara fitfully sleeps. A SHADOW falls over her. She stirs as
a hand pulls the dagger from the bedpost. She jerks up,
cowering. Aislinn steps into the candlelight.

KARA
How did you come here?
 

55

AISLINN
T have my ways.
KARA
Why did you come?
AISLINN
To help.
KARA
I need no help from her who bore the
beast.
AISLINN

I bore a child...An innocent child. Was
it his fault he was the bitter fruit of a
seed sown without love?

KARA
I would have smothered such a child in
his crib.

AISLINN

You say so now. I thought so once. But
when you hold him in your arms, you do
not see the monster he can become...Only
a small something that is a part of you,
erying for your nourishment, frail and
helpless... And you do not realize you
are the helpless one.

(bitter outburst)
How could I guide him when I was merely a
bit of plunder? A creature of
submission. Allowed no pleasure. No
feelings. No voice. How could he hear
me? What was left for him but his
father's taint?

Aislinn, trembling with emotion, regains her regal composure.

KARA
Is this the help you offer? To foretell
my future in your past? Give me the
dagger. Let me kill myself before I am
accomplice to this vile legacy.

AISLINN
Why wish for death, when there is
freedom?

The Queen takes a candle and goes to a corner of the chamber,
illuminating a stone wall. She presses a hidden spring and
the wall creaks open, exposing a secret passage.
56
INT. EINON'S CASTLE - CISTERN - NIGRT
A stone wall slides open and Kara and Aislinn step out into a
large CISTERN. Below them is the water. Aislinn leads Kara
down a stone path that runs along the wall of the cistern.
Kara sees the door on the other side and starts to open it,
but Aislinn stops her, sliding open a small hatch in the
door. Through the peephole, Kara can see...
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ COURTYARD - NIGHT

«.+.The guards patrolling the courtyard.

-INT. EINON'S CASTLE - CISTERN - NIGHT

Aislinn points to an iron door, just above the water's
surface. Kara heads for it, stopping before it to turn back.

KARA
Thank y...

But Aislinn has disappeared once more into the shadows.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BASE OF TRE WALL - NIGHT

Kara stealthily emerges from a crevice of the castle wall's
rocky foundation and slides down a steep pass into the
darkness of the night.

EXT. CANYON - ON BOWEN - NIGHT

A cape around his shoulders, nodding off to sleep. As his
head slumps forward, he jerks it back, popping his eyes open.

DRAGON (0S)
Have you been watching over me all night?

CAMERA BACK. The Dragon is curled on the ground behind
Bowen, who has indeed been holding vigil, though he's
embarrassed by it.

BOWEN
I've...been thinking...

DRAGON
About what...?

BOWEN
Many things...Mostly what to call you.
I've found you a name.

DRAGON
57

You say that as though you reached up and
plucked it from the sky.

BOWEN
I did. Up there. See that cluster of
stars there?

EXT. STARRY -SKY - NIGHT

A SERIES OF STARS shine brilliantly against night's black
curtain. It is the CONSTELLATION OF DRACO.

(NOTE: The radiance of these stars should be highly
exaggerated to make the pattern of the constellation plainly
visible.)

The Dragon's head looms into frame, staring at the stars.

DRAGON
I know those stars very well.

EXT. CANYON ~ NIGHT

The Dragon gazes up at the stars in fervent longing.

BOWEN

Do you see the shape they make?
DRAGON

A dragon.
BOWEN

Yes. We call it DRACO. It means dragon
in the scholar's speech.

DRAGON
So instead of calling me Dragon in your
tongue, you'll call me Dragon in some
other tongue.

BOWEN
You're right. It's a silly idea.

DRAGON
No...I would be honoured to be named
after those stars. Draco. Thank you,
Kni...Do you have a name?

BOWEN
Bowen.

. DRAGON
Thank you, Bowen.

DRACO looks skyward at his namesake.
 

58

DRACO
...Draco...

The serpentine constellation glows in the night sky.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - LONG SHOT ~ NIGHT
CRASHING & YELLING echoes from within the forbidding edifice.
EINON (0S)

Dogs! Fools!

INT. BEDCHAMBER ~ EINON'S CASTLE -— NIGHT

‘A GUARD flies across the room, clattering into a table and

chairs. ANOTHER GUARD staggers out of the debris of
overturned bedding and a nightstand. An enraged Einon grabs
him by the neck and flings him into the open fireplace.

A nervous Brok and an inscrutable Aislinn watch Einon's
lethal tantrum as the guard rolls yelping out of the fire and
Einon descends on him with the IRON FIREPLACE POKER,
repeatedly beating the man on the back and legs.

EINON
If you can't guard a simple girl, then go
guard shades in Hell.

Brok intercedes with wary caution.

BROK
Sire! How could they have known of that?

Wild with fury, spittle flecking his lips, he spins on Brok,
pressing the tip of the poker against the Knight's throat as
though he'd plunge through the other side. Brok points to
the open secret passage. Einon turns to it, his rage
subsiding slightly as he's struck by a thought.

EINON
More importantly, how could the girl
know?

His dark gaze shifts to his mother as he lowers the poker
from Brok's throat. He kicks the guard at his feet and
flings the poker at the other.

EINON
Get out!

The guards scurry out the door. Einon, still staring at his
mother, issues a command to Brok.

EINON
Get my best men!
59
Brok bows and exits. Aislinn cooly returns Einon's gaze.

AISLINN
I'll send someone to clean up this mess.

She exits. Einon suspiciously watches her go.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - DAY

A BARRAGE OF VEGETABLES COMES FLYING AT THE CAMERA, which
PANS TO:

AN ANGRY MOB...pursuing A DISHEVELLED YOUNG WOMAN through the
village, pelting her with rotten vegetables and handfuls of
mud. Shouting above the crowd, the girl futilely tries to
-hold her ground. Underneath the mud, splattered produce, and
grungy clothes, it's KARA!

KARA
Throw off the yoke of Einon's oppression.
Raise arms, I say!

SPLOTCH! A ROTTEN CABBAGE plows into her chest. SPLAT! A
GLOP OF MUD smacks her forehead.

KARA
Listen to me!

WHACK! MORE MUD sprays across her. A strapping blacksmith,
HEWE, sporting an EYEPATCH, has thrown it.

HEWE
To treason! Your father sang that sour
tune once, Kara.
(points to his eye)
And once was enough. We'll not dance to

it again!

KARA
No, just cringe like dogs under Einon's
boot.

HEWE

A cringing dog's a live one!

Hewe rears back to toss a SQUASH, but ANOTHER HAND plucks it
from his grasp. The peasant angrily wheels about to
confront...

BOWEN...breaking the squash in half and biting into a piece.
Kara remembers him instantly and a smile of recognition
breaks through the veil of dripping vegetables.

BOWEN
Why waste good food on bad rhetoric?

Kara's smile disappears as she snarls in umbrage.
60

KARA
I speak truth!

BOWEN
(munching squash)
Truth is rarely inspiring, lass, and
never wins rebellions. But. it can
stretch rebels' necks...if there is a
neck under that vegetable patch.

Kara self-consciously wipes at her face. Grinning, Bowen,
offers her the other squash half. She indignantly shoves it
in his face. The crowd laughs then...

A WOMAN SCREAMS...and points skyward...A WIND rustles through
the village as the crowd dives for cover. Bowen wipes the

‘squash from his eyes just in time to see:

DRACO'S WING...dip past, knocking a PATCH OF THATCH off a hut
roof. It plops on...

BOWEN...who falls to the ground underneath it. He comes up
spewing thatch and glaring skyward, mumbling to himself.

BOWEN
Show-off...

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - LATER ~ DAY

Draco, smoke curling from his nostrils, perches on a rocky
ledge overhanging a GROVE OF TREES a short distance from the
village like a vulture, hungrily eying...

THE VILLAGERS...huddling behind their hut. Hewe dickers with
a peeved Bowen, still picking thatch out of his clothes.

BOWEN
Where's the Lord responsible for this
village?

HEWE

In a fine house six miles away. He'll
just blame any destruction on us and
pluck our pockets to pay for it.

This remark nettles Bowen's latent conscience but not enough
to dissuade him.

BOWEN
Well, I won't pluck them as deeply! It
was a fair offer, take it or leave..-him!
(points to Draco)

The villagers mumble among themselves as Kara shoves through
the crowd, dripping mud and mushy vegetables in her wake.

KARA
61

(points to Bowen)
Leave him! It's bad enough you grovel to
Einon. Will you be bullied by some
blackmailing broken-down knight? You
don't need him to get rid of a dragon!

Bowen glares, caring neither for her insults nor meddling.
He turns to a ROTUND VILLAGER with THREE ROTUND DAUGHTERS.

BOWEN
That's right. Perhaps you'll part with
one of your delectable daughters instead
of gold. Dragons are partial to maiden
sacrifices.

The Rotund Villager fans his arms in front of his daughters
to protect them from such a horrid thought. But Hewe likes
the idea, with alterations...

HEWE
Why must it be a daughter?

The crowd turns with him as his shifty gaze falls on...

KARA...jaw dropping as she realizes their intent.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - THE FIELD ~ DAY

The VILLAGERS roll a rickety CART out to an open field, the
old battlefield where they fought King Freyne. Kara,
strapped to a pole wedged into the back of the cart, yells
her head off.

KARA
No! No! Please! I'm not even a virgin!

Bowen watches in exasperated disgust.

BOWEN
Superstitious yokels.

He mounts up and rides out of the village.

EXT. ROCK SPIRE - DAY

From his perch, Draco watches the shenanigans of the
villagers in utter befuddlement. Suddenly, he sees Bowen
below, riding up to the base of the rock.

DRACO
Who's the girl?

BOWEN
A nuisance. Get rid of her.
62

DRACO
Why?
BOWEN
They're trying to placate you with a
sacrifice.
DRACO
Whoever gave them that bright idea?
BOWEN
Never mind! They're imbeciles.
DRACO.
Barbarians!
BOWEN
Just get rid of her!
DRACO
How?
BOWEN
How should I know? Eat her.
DRACO
Oh please! Yecch!
BOWEN
My, aren't we squeamish? You ate Sir
Eglamore.
DRACO
I never swallowed! Merely chewed in
self~defense.
BOWEN

Oh...then I suppose torching her's out of
the question.

DRACO
Absolutely!

BOWEN
It would impress the yokels.

DRACO
Will you listen to yourself?

BOWEN
Well...then...improvise!

Draco heaves a sigh and swoops off the rock towards...
63
EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - THE FIELD - DAY

KARA...who screams, Draco reaches out a claw to her
whereupon she faints. Draco wrenches the stake out of the
cart, flies off with the limp girl OUT OF FRAME.

As the empty stake plops back down to the ground, the CROWD
pours out into the village, cheering.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

A sour-faced Bowen comes riding through. Suddenly he hears
TRILLING. The strange DRAGONSONG. But this time the musical
trill is light and happy, not melancholy as before.

-Bowen spurs his horse to the sound, coming to a clearing
where he spies...

EXT. WATERFALL - DUSK

KARA...sits on a rock, soaking up the sun, as Draco
contentedly trills. Kara is transported, touched by the
strange music. She smiles at Draco.

KARA
You have a beautiful voice.

Draco BLUSHES A BRIGHT CRIMSON. Kara laughs at his awkward
shyness.

KARA
You're not like a dragon at all.

DRACO
How many do you know?

KARA
None that serenade maidens instead of
devouring them. You're entirely too
happy for a dragon. I bet you don't do
any of the horrid things they say.

DRACO
Minstrels' fancies. Never hurt a soul
unless they try to hurt me first.

KARA
Then why were you in that village?

DRACO
Oh?...0h! The village!

BOWEN (0S)
Yes! You remember the village.

Both Kara and Draco turn to...
64

BOWEN...stomping toward them. Kara emits a warlike screech
and leaps onto his horse. She plops in the saddle, face~to-
face with Bowen and starts to pummel him.

KARA
Leave him alone, you bully! Run, Draco,
fly! I'll hold hin,
(to Bowen)
Pick on someone your own size!

Draco suppresses his laughter as Bowen and Kara tumble from
the saddle in the pond. Bowen sputters at Draco.

BOWEN
Where have you been?
DRACO
I've been...distracted...Bowen, meet

Kara.

Bowen turns to Kara and, with an exasperated sigh,
grabs her floundering arm to help her up. She slaps him
away. He lets go. She flops back down in the pond.

BOWEN
You should have eaten her!

DRACO
Now don't be angry.

BOWEN
Why not? You left me high and dry.
Worried to death...

DRACO
Worried? Over me?

BOWEN
.+-Here I am waiting around...I don't
know what's happened? Where you are?
When you're coming back?...

Suddenly Draco tenses. All aquiver. Listening. He whirls
back behind the waterfall. Kara watches him go.

BOWEN
...-If you're coming back? You just...

Bowen wheels back to Draco, only to discover him gone.

BOWEN
...disappear...

He glares suspiciously at Kara, as though she's hidden him.
Before she can respond, Draco's head pops through the
waterfall.
65

DRACO
Horses. Someone's coming.

Draco ducks back behind the falls as Bowen and Kara also hear
the horses. Bowen turns to face them.

THE RIDERS emerge from the trees. Kara recognizes them. And
they, her! It's EINON with a search party.

As the Riders charge up, Bowen leaps protectively in front of
the frightened girl, his sword whirling in a flashy display
as Einon's minions hesitate. As they slowly surround hin,
Bowen tensely holds his ground. BOOMING LAUGHTER suddenly
breaks the stand-off.

EINON
It can't be! But it is! The king's old
mentor! Still giving carving lessons?

Bowen sizes Einon up. He doesn't care for what he sees.

BOWEN
Get off your horse and I'll give you one.
EINON
I'm bigger now. Perhaps, I'll give you
one.
BOWEN
Stick to slaughtering peasants. It's
safer.
EINON

Oh, we don't slaughter them anymore.
They can't pay their taxes if they're
dead.

(surveys Bowen's

ragged condition)
Seems times have not been kind, Bowen.
You should never have broke with me.

BOWEN
It was you who broke with me.

Einon idly strokes his scar in dark and, perhaps, even
regretful remembrance. But he shakes off old memories with a
twisted smile.

EINON
Yet you return to me and with my lost
lady.

Bowen turns to Kara, surprised. She shakes her head in
vigorous denial.

BOWEN
I think the lady wants to stay lost.
66

EINON
Not her choice, I'm afraid.

BOWEN
My three feet of steel says it is,

Kara laughs, delighted to have a defender. Einon flushes
with anger. Then he slowly smiles as he unsheaths his sword.

EINON
I'm ready for my lesson now, knight...

As Bowen tenses, on guard, expecting an hounourable fight.
Instead, he gets a dirty trick.

EINON
But first, one for you!

Einon flings his shield at him. Bowen is knocked into the
water. He deftly rolls and uses the shield to protect
himself from the flailing hooves of Einon's horse as,
laughing savagely, Einon charges over him and grabs Kara by
the hair, jerking her head back.

EINON
Don't go anywhere, sweet. This won't
take long.

He bends over and ruthlessly kisses the squirming girl. As
he does, Bowen springs up and slams the shield against
Einon's back, unseating him from his horse.

BOWEN
Only expose your back to a corpse.
That's one lesson you never learned.

Einon's men start to rush in, but Einon comes up shaking
water, eyes flashing.

EINON
Stand back!
(to Bowen)
You are a corpse!

The two engage. Trading fast and furious blows. As they
fight, a shadow watches from behind the waterfall.

INT. WATERFALL - CAVE - DAY

The two combatants are watched through the cascading water.

The clank of steel is heard above the rushing water. And the
laboured breathing of Draco.
67
EXT. WATERFALL - DAY

The swordplay is dazzling and Bowen's holding his own. But
Einon's younger. And faster.

EINON
Lie down, Knight. Life has passed you
by. You'tre the sorry scrap of dead world
and dead beliefs!

The taunts renew Bowen's fury.

BOWEN
They were your beliefs!

EINON
Never! Never mine!

BOWEN
They were! The old code...

EINON
I spit on your code! I spit on it then.
And I spit on it now!

BOWEN
No! You knew the words! You spoke them!

EINON
I vomitted them up because I couldn't
stomach them.

Bowen doesn't want to hear it. His sad fantasy that the
Dragon tainted Einon is unravelling. Tears well in his eyes.
He tries to shout down the truth.

BOWEN
Lies! I taught you...

EINON
...-to fight! That's all! I took what I
needed from you, knight. You taught me
to fight! And well!

It's the coup de grace. Bowen, dazed by his broken dream,
attacks sloppily. Einon's blade rips across his shoulder and
sends the shattered knight spinning back onto his knees in
the water.

Einon charges in, blade upraised. But before he can deliver
the deathblow, he's blinded by a SWOOSHING SPRAY OF WATER.
Growling, he shakes it from his eyes to discover...

DRACO...between Einon and Bowen. Roaring fiercely. His
wings swing up and the scales on his chest fall back,

exposing...THE RED SCAR on his chest. Einon, quaking in
fear, recognizes the Dragon...and his death and SCREAMS.
68

Dashing for his horse, the terrified king mounts and gallops
away. The rest of his minions follow him. Bowen staggers
out of the water and sloshes over to Draco. He is still
shaken and angry from his encounter with Einon.

BOWEN
Who asked you to butt in? I had
everything under control!

Draco doesn't answer. He watches Einon ride off, disturbed
and concerned. Someone else is disturbed by something.
Bowen feels a tug at his sleeve. It's Kara.

KARA
Just how is it you two know each other?

-Bowen and Draco trade a sheepish glance.

EXT. SWAMP VILLAGE - BRIDGE — DAY

Bowen leads his horse across a rickety bridge over a swampy
river. Kara walks along side him. Bowen winces and rubs his
wounded shoulder.

KARA
Here. Let me see.

She opens his jerkin and tenderly removes the ragged bandage.
Bowen. watches her. Her head close to his. She looks up and
catches him staring at her. He quickly shifts his gaze.

KARA
It's all healed, Bowen. Just a little
stiff.

Bowen limbers up his arm. His eyes rove downriver where a
cluster of MUD HUTS sit on an island in the middle of a
DREARY, MIST-ENSHROUDED MARSH.

BOWEN
That village ought to give it a little
exercise.

He looks up as a SHADOW passes overhead.

KARA
But no medicine for your other wound.

Bowen rubs his shoulder and glares at her. She appraises him
with hurt, disappointed, pleading eyes.

BOWEN
I have no other wound.
69

KARA
You won't soothe your sick heart, Bowen,
by wasting your courage and skill on
worthless acts.

BOWEN
What wound festers in you, girl?

KARA
A deep one. It hurts to know my heroes
are nothing more than charlatans looking
out only for themselves.

A SHADOW intermittently passes over the pair.

BOWEN
Well, that's the way the wretched world
turns, girl.

KARA
And those who cannot look out for
themselves?...You could lead them, Bowen.
Give them hope.

BOWEN
False hope! Even if you could raise a
ragtag army, what chance do they have
against seasoned troops? The last time
they tried it ended up a massacre. I
remember! I was there!

KARA
So was I. And I remember more. One lone
knight who dare to stand against the king
and saved a rebel from a blinding.
(Bowen turns sharply)
---for a little while anyway..-.You,
Bowen. The rebel was my father.

She sadly fingers Red-beard's headband about her throat.
Bowen looks at her, the memory slowly crystallizing.

KARA
Let others stand with you and this time
the end will be different.

Bowen takes her gently by the shoulders, gazing sadly in her
flaring eyes, drinking in her angry beauty with melancholy
yearning. Unable to stand his probing gaze, Kara breaks
away.

KARA
What are you looking at?

BOWEN
Myself once upon a time...
70

Bowen mounts his horse. As the Shadow passes overhead again,
he calls up to it.

BOWEN
I'll see you in the village, Draco.

As he mounts up, Draco floats down beside Kara, appraising
her with sad, disturbed eyes.

DRACO
What will you do, Kara?
KARA
Try to turn the wretched world the other

way.

‘Bowen turns back and looks at them for a moment and then

spurs his horse over the bridge.

DRACO
Einon will not fall in my lifetime.

Unable to look at her any longer, Draco zooms off downriver.
Kara watches him go.

EXT. SWAMP VILLAGE -DAY

Bowen swats at BUZZING MOSQUITOS as he rides through a
marshland river toward...

A VILLAGE...situated on an island in the middle of a DREARY,
MIST-ENSHROUDED MARSH. From the looks of it, the village is
fairly dreary too. From the mud and straw huts emerge
SEVERAL TALL BRUTISH WARRIORS who come forth to meet Bowen.

They hesitate as the RUSTLE OF WINGS and WIND kicks past
them, looking skyward. So does Bowen. Then he looks
dubiously at the village. With a weary shake of his head, he
swats another mosquito and leads his horse through the
shallow marsh.

EXT. SWAMP VILLAGE - MONEY SACK —- DAY

A MONEY SACK is passed from hand-to-hand...each dropping
something of value in it. A coin or two...a tarnished goblet
+..a ring. CAMERA BACK as the sack is given to the VILLAGE
CHIEF -- a gaunt giant who holds the sack out to:

BOWEN...miserable. The village is miserable. The villagers
are miserable. Towering, ragged giants, hollow cheeks and
haunted eyes. No minion of Einon's here to gouge. Nor to
act as a salve to his guilty conscience. Mortified, Bowen
swats at the mosquitos that seem to abound. Even the climate
and the livestock are miserable. He stares up at...

DRACO...who menacingly flies over the swamp.
71

KARA (OS)
Wait!

KARA...pushes through the press of villagers.

KARA
This man is a fraud!

The Chief jerks the money back. Kara smiles in gloating
triumph. Bowen thrusts out his dragonhorn shield.

BOWEN
Is this a fraud? That girl's a wandering
idiot, babbling nonsense!

KARA
That's a lie! This Knight is no
Dragonslayer.

GILBERT (OS)

You're mistaken, my child.

FRIAR GILBERT...emerges from the crowd, his parchment sack
slung on his back, swatting at the mosquitos with a scroll.
A welcome sight for Bowen.

BOWEN
Gilbert!

GILBERT

(embraces him)
Bowen, my lad! Praise the Saints, you're
alive! And whole!

(feels Bowen's arm to

make sure; to Chief)
You couldn't put your trust in a better
man. I have personally seen him slay
almost two dragons.

KARA
Almost?

GILBERT
Well, I didn't actually witness the
deathblow to the second, but since Sir
Bowen's here, he must have won!

BOWEN
(smugly)
I never lose.
Chief thrusts the money at Bowen again, but Kara stops hin.

KARA
No! He's in league with the dragon!
72

Everyone stares at her. Bowen. Gilbert. The Villlagers.

Their Chief...who slowly starts to chuckle, then laugh. He
hands the money to Bowen who also laughs and makes a crazy

sign in reference to Kara.

BOWEN
Told you. An addle-pated ninny!

Everyone is laughing now, except a fuming Kara!

EXT. SWAMP VILLAGE ~ EDGE OF SWAMP -DAY

Bowen has once again devised "A WHACKER". Gilbert gleefully
helps out, driving the ballast-cart ox into position until
Bowen signals him to stop.

BOWEN
Whoa, Gilbert. Hold it steady there!

As Bowen loads and sights "The Whacker", Kara, like one of
the constantly buzzing mosquitos, hovers beside Bowen,
speaking so Gilbert cannot overhear.

KARA
I thought you had sunk low, Bowen. But
not this low.

BOWEN
Wait till you see how low Draco sinks.

Twang! Bowen slices the rope-trigger and the HARPOON flies
off toward...

DRACO...who expertly snares the lance under his wing and, as
before, goes into his death-throes and swoons down into the
marsh. But not under! He lands with a huge muddy splat that
sprays both Kara and Bowen.

Bowen wipes off muck, finding Draco at the edge of the swamp,
belly up, eyes closed, frozen in an awkward death pose.

BOWEN
Well, sink! sink!

DRACO
(not breaking his
pose)
How? It doesn't get any deeper.

Kara laughs at their predicament. Bowen wheels and glares at
her, just as Gilbert coming joyously running up.

GILBERT
You've done it again, Sir Knight! Oooh,
look at the brute. Bigger than the last
one you tangled with.
73

BOWEN
Actually, he's about the same size.

Bowen steers Gilbert away. But he can't steer away...

THE SWAMP PEOPLE...charging up. Armed to the teeth with
axes. Mouths watering. Chanting rapturously.

SWAMP PEOPLE
Meat! Meat!

BOWEN
Uh-oh...

Shocked, Draco breaks his death tableau, jerking his head up.

GILBERT
Good Lord, It's alive!

The swamp people halt when they see the dragon's not dead
yet! But their Chief urges them on.

CHIEF
Quickly! Kill it while it's down.

Bowen, having mounted, rides out to stop them.

BOWEN
No! Stay back!

They don't...rushing by him, chanting "Meat!", toward...

DRACO...flopping up an@ fluttering about like a duck stuck in
the mud. He finally gets unstuck and, just as the swamp
dwellers descend on him, whooshes out of the mud and out of
reach.

The swamp people turn back, glaring with suspicious hunger
at...

BOWEN & KARA...who watch them start to close in.
BOWEN

(to Kara)
Happy now? They're on to us.

KARA
Us?

BOWEN
Come on. We don't want to stay for
dinner.

He scoops Kara over the back of the saddle like a sack of
wheat and spurs his horse through the pack of angry swampers.
More swampers rush...
74

GILBERT...utterly baffled by all this. He hollers a startled
screech and sloshes through the marsh, joining the panicked
parade of swampers, Bowen, Kara, and the horse.

He runs smack dab into the chief, who raises his huge
cleaver. Before it can come down, the money sack smacks him
in the chops...flung by Bowen, riding up.

BOWEN
No dragon, no charge!

Bowen gives the priest a hand onto the rump of the overburden
steed. Gilbert clutches slumped-over Kara's rump.

KARA
Hey!

GILBERT
Forgive me!

Kara squirms right side up, only backwards on the horse,
facing Gilbert who reaches again for support, nearly grabbing
Kara's breasts. Her scandalized look dissaudes him and he
clutches Bowen's sides which causes his bald pate to nestle
in Kara's cleavage as the two are bobbled by the swerving
horse. But no matter which way they turn, swampers are
closing in.

But there's one way left to turn. Up. And Draco provides
it. Swampers go squealing, as Draco's wings FILL THE SCREEN.
When he swoops OUT OF FRAME, all that's left in the swamp are
the swampers. The horse and its riders are gone.

The swamp folk watch the low-flying Dragon and his cargo
disappear into the DENSE FOG enshrouding the heart of the
swamp. The Chief's sharp eyes stare up into the mist...to
the craggy TOR jutting up out of the haze.

EXT. TOR ~ AERIAL SHOT ~ DAY

The SCREEN IS FILLED WITH THICK FOG, we hear FLAPPING WINGS.
A FRIGHTENED NEIGH. THEN GILBERT'S QUAVERING VOICE.

GILBERT (0S)
Saints perserve us! I nearly have my
bald pate trimmed at my neck. I find you
in league with a pair of rogues...one, a
Dragon who kidnaps me...! Only to get us
lost in this dreadful fog!

DRACO(0S)
Not lost. Never lost.

Draco's firm voice shushes the whining. As does the SIGHT
looming out of the thinning fog....
75

THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE...seen from above. At its
center is a RING OF EERIE STONE COLUMNS.

GILBERT (OS)
What deadly, unholy place is this?

DRACO (OS)
Most holy, priest. More than death
dwells here, Brother Gilbert.

GILBERT (0S)
W- What more?

DRACO (OS)

A spirit. Beyond death. Alive and
eternal. That remembers the Once-ways
and the glory of one who shared our name.

BOWEN (0S)
What one?

DRACO (0S)
The Pendragon!

GILBERT
Pend --! Arthur Pendragon!... King
Arthur! A land of mist...Avalon!

Avalon! Coming closer and closer into view!

EXT. TOR - NIGHT

Gilbert prays before the tallest column in the circle of
stone.

GILBERT
So it was foretold. And so I have found
you, Brave Arthur. Among your brother
knights in a grove upon a tor. Nota
grove. But the Round Table of Camelot...

This mention of the Round Table has it's affect on...

BOWEN...moving solemnly among the stone columns, talking to
himself, touching the stones.

BOWEN
The Round Table..Here was Sir Gawain's
place...Here Galahad...

GILBERT
Let us who remember the glories of your
golden kingdom feel your noble spirit, 0
King.

Bowen weaves through the columns, stopping at the one just to
the right of Arthur's.
76

BOWEN
»»-Lancelot...the right hand of Arthur.

GILBERT
-.and let the Song of Excalibur echo in
our enemy's ear. Amen...I'm ready, my
child.

He rises and joins Kara. Both turn to Bowen, moving slowly
to Arthur's stone.

GILBERT
And you, Bowen?

Bowen is obviously moved by this experience, but not moved
enough to give Gilbert the answer he hopes for.

GILBERT
My son...This is Avalon. The shadow
realm of the Round Table. It is a divine
omen!

BOWEN

Omens and shadows won't win battles. Nor
will you. You'll find out soon enough
when you try to raise your army.

(to Kara)
You already know the courage of your
village. They're very brave at pelting
girls with vegetables.

KARA
It must start somewhere.

KARA
Will you wish us luck, Draco?

She turns to...

DRACO...perched on a crumbling castle turret framed between
two of the stone columns, gazing up at the sky...at the DRACO
CONSTELLATION.

DRACO
Long ago, when man was young and the
dragon already old, the wisest of our
race took pity on man and shared with him
our secrets. And when this Wise One was
dying, he gathered together all the
dragons, making them vow to watch over
man always. And at the moment of his
death, the night became alive with those
stars.
77
DRACO'S POV - "THE DRACO CONSTELLATION
It glitters brightly in the black sky.

DRACO (0S)
Through the years, his shimmering soul
was joined by others, as the dragons kept
their pledge to serve man...until the
heavens were aglow with stars.

BACK TO SCENE
Draco looks back down on the trio below.

DRACO
But then man grew arrogant with the gift
of our power and shunned our guidance.
And fewer stars ascended the sky to hold
back black night.

Draco gazes forlornly at the sky.

DRACO
All my life I've longed to perform one
deed worthy of those shining above.
Finally my chance came. A great
sacrifice that would reunite
man and dragon and ensure my place
among my ancient brothers of the sky...
But my sacrifice became my sin.

BOWEN
It was you. Your half-heart beats in
Einon's breast.

Draco descends into the circle of stone, baring the scales on
his breast, revealing a jagged crimson scar.

DRACO
Yes. My half~heart that cost all my
soul. Even then I knew his bloodthirsty
nature, but I thought the heart could
change him. My God, I was naive.

Bowen barks a short savage laugh, then the bitterness in his
eyes is overwhelmed by tortured melancholy.

BOWEN

(quiet hollowness)
No more than I...Always I dreamed of
serving noble kings and nobler ideals.
But dreams die hard. And you hold them
in your hands long after they've crumbled
to dust. And in your heart long after
they've soured to bitter poison... I will
not be that naive again.
78

DRACO
Kara, I will go with you.

Bowen wheels to Draco, stunned by the declaration...And the
sudden realization that now he is alone. But it does not
change his conviction. He turns from the others and walks
out of the circle of stone. Draco sadly watches him go.

DRACO
So be it. Farewell, Bowen.

EXT. TOR - ON SKY - NIGHT
RAIN comes down in torrents. CAMERA PANS TO...

-BOWEN...who seeks shelter in the hollow of crumbling turret.
The wind howls. The rain lances through the ever-present
mist. Bowen pulls up his cloak. Then he hears...A HOARSE
WHISPER.

WHISPER
Valour...Valour...

Bowen springs up, peering into rainy, windswept mist.

WHISPER
Valour...

Bowen. whirls to the sound...It comes the stone columns.

GHOST VOICE #1
A knight is sworn to valour...

GHOST VOICE #2
His heart knows only virtue...

Rising up, Bowen walks from his shelter, listening to the
voices. Then a third VOICE joins the other GHOST
VOICES...then a FOURTH...

GHOST VOICE #3
His blade defends the helpless...

GHOST VOICE #4
His might upholds the weak...

Their hollow voices echo and overlap in the wind. A VOICE
floats out of LANCELOT'S stone next to Bowen, who falls back.

LAUNCELOT'S VOICE
His word speaks only truth.

Then THE LAST VOICE...ARTHUR'S rises from his stone. Bowen
collapses to his knees as more than Arthur's voice emerges
from the stone...
79

ARTHUR'S GHOSTLY IMAGE...floats before the stunned knight.
Eerie and majestic. Pale and as wispy as the swirling mist.
Slashed by the rain. Wavering in the wind.

ARTHUR'S VOICE
His wrath undoes the wicked!

More GHOST VOICES OF THE ROUNDTABLE JOIN the echoing
brotherhood, reciting the Old Code in a crescendoing
cacophony accompanied by the roaring thunder and the driving
rain, whirling about Bowen in the whipping wind.

Drenched in rain and tears, Bowen covers his head from the
forbidding image of Arthur, from the jumble of sound,
reciting the code himself in a breathless, rushed litany,
trying to shout down the mad singsong racket of the spirit
-voices, trying to keep the sense of the words and their
Meaning.

BOWEN
A knight is sworn to valour. His heart
knows only virtue. Blade defends the
helpless. Upholds the weak. Speaks only
truth...!

He's stopped, realizing his is the only voice he hears. The
others are silent. All but one...Arthur's image is fading
back into the stone.

GHOST OF ARTHUR
(faintly)
His wrath...

He's gone. Head bowed, Bowen kneels before Arthur's rock,
reaching out to touch it.

BOWEN
(whispering)
+--undoes the wicked.

Thunder roars. Lightning flashes. In its jagged light,
something new is revealed..

DRACO...Bowen stares up longingly at him and Draco, the rain
streaming down his face, into his kindly eyes, stretches out
his wing to shield the knight from the storm.

There they stay, huddled in the shadow of the rocky symbol of
their once-lost dreams and their new-found hope...two lost
souls cleansed and purified in the heavenly rain and reunited
in a common vision.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - ON QUARTER-STAVE - DAY

A QUARTER-STAVE smashes down on another. CAMERA BACK, as
one-eyed Hewe drives Kara to the ground with the blow. OTHER
VILLAGERS crowd around, laughing and mocking. Gilbert
scrambles to Kara's side and helps her to her feet.
80

HEWE
And we're suppose to follow you and a
Priest against Einon! To Hell, more
likely! We've had enough of your moon-~
eyed mischief, girl! Begone!

Hewe raises his staff to beat them off. But AN ARROW
suddenly imbeds itself in the staff. All eyes turn to...

A RIDER...who slings his bow and gallops into the village,
framed against the rising sun. His horse rears as the rider
halts between Gilbert and Kara and Hewe. It is...

BOWEN...scrubbed and shaved. Clothes and armour, though
frayed and worn, are clean and mended as best can be. His
eyes shine with a fierce fine visionary fire. He plucks his
‘arrow from the staff.

BOWEN
Save your strength for the fight against
Einon.
HEWE
(contemptuously)

There isn't any fight against Einon.

BOWEN
I'm going to start one.

Kara and Gilbert react to this good news.

HEWE
You and what army, knight?

BOWEN
He'll enlist!

He jerks a thumb over his shoulder at...

DRACO...as he rising up from behind the horizon of a ridge.
Majestic. Aglow. Like fire. Ablaze in the morning sun.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - TRAINING GROUNDS ~ MONTAGE ~ DAY
PREPARATIONS FOR WAR - SERIES OF SHOTS

A FORGE blows fiery hot, as HEWE and the other BLACKSMITHS
smelt plowshears back into molten metal. OTHER PEASANTS
contribute metal farm implements to the piles rising high for
the war effort. MOLTEN METAL is poured into MOLDS for
swords, and pike-tips and arrow points. RAW WEAPONS hiss as
they are dipped in cold water and dumped onto tables where
MEN hone and sharpen them.
81

PEASANTS are flocking to the cause. Men come with their own
¢rude weapons and bring their families with them. Bowen and
Gilbert sort them out and direct them to functions and camp
placements.

WOMEN AND CHILDREN work an arrow-making assembly line,
stripping the shafts with "strippers, affixing points with
sinew, gluing feathers on. Finished arrows are bundled and
stacked.

BOWEN watches in amusement as GILBERT gets an archery lesson
from some of the villagers. He struggles to pull back the
bowstring. When he lets go of it, the bow goes flying and
he's still holding onto the arrow.

HEWE watches men run through a series of exercises with a
PIKE, tilting at wooden models.

A COMMAND TENT is going up behind Bowen as he discusses
strategy with Gilbert, Kara, Hewe, and the other chosen
generals. Parchment maps are strewn over a rickety table and
Gilbert, with a quill, draws lines and swirls on them at
Bowen's direction.

GILBERT (VO)
The sky's untouched without the reach,
The dream's no good without the dare,
And one must fight for what one wants,
Tis purpose God attends, not prayer.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - DAY

Kara swings a heavy BATTLE-AXE through a series of exercises.
As she whirls it above her head, the momentum sends her
staggering back against...

BOWEN...who stops her fall..

BOWEN
Easy...

KARA
(shyly)
oh...Thank you...

She doesn't move. Nor is he in any hurry to dislodge her.
They're very close, staring stupidly at each other, before
Bowen awkwardly seques from romance to warfare. Not letting
go of her, he nudges her legs apart with one of his own.

BOWEN
Here...widen your stance.

He guides her arms up, holding the axe aloft.

BOWEN
Up...then down.
82

Their arms swing down together. Their bodies sway forward,
his pressed tightly against her from behind.

BOWEN
That's it...One fluid stroke..

The downward arc of the axe almost throws Kara off-balance.
But Bowen's enfolding arms steady her. Her hair brushes his
face. Her lips almost touch his cheek as she turns to hin.

KARA
That could cleave a man's skull.

BOWEN
Like a pudding.

Neither moves from their awkward embrace. Her warm breath
intoxicates him and he reels back from her spell, axe in
hand. Then grinning with school-boy bravura, he flings the
axe. It spirals through the air, striking a PUMPKIN and
splitting it neatly in two.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - ARCHERY RANGE - DAY
A BOWSTRING is pulled tentatively back...

GILBERT...is the archer, receiving patient instruction from
Bowen.

BOWEN
That's it! Sight along the arrow. Now
release!

"THWACK!" THE ARROW buries itself right in the middle of a
STRAW MAN'S HEART. CAMERA PANS to Gilbert. He smiles
proudly over at...

THE DUMBFOUNDED PEASANTS...mouths agape...including Hewe.

HEWE
Beginner's luck! Try again!

Gilbert eagerly notches another arrow, consummately
performing Bowen's directions and lets fly. This time it
hits the straw dummy right between the eyes. Bowen lets out
a long, impressed whistle.

BOWEN

Brother Gilbert, you're a natural.
GILBERT

This is fun!
BOWEN

Not for the fellow you're aiming at. Try
again.
83

He points at the straw target again. Gilbert delightedly
lets fly with another direct hit. Right in the dumny's
crotch. Bowen grins and looks over at a disbelieving Hewe
and shrugs.

BOWEN
A natural.

INT. TENT - ON BOWEN - DAWN

Bowen sleeps in his tent. Suddenly, A BELLOWING HONKING WAIL
pierces his slumber, He jerks awake, naked to the waist, his
eyes wide with a startled groggy glaze. He turns to see...

Kara...holding a war trumpet.

KARA
Battle horn! Good tone, don't you think?

No, Bowen doesn't think. He just mumbles inarticulately.
Kara throws his jerkin in his face.

KARA
Sun's up, Knight. So's the army. Why
aren't you? Breakfast!

She stuffs a hunk of bread into his mouth. Bowen heaves a
muffled groan.

KARA
Too dry?

She yanks the bread from his slack~jawed mouth. He puffs his
lips and sleepily tries to blow the sprinkled crumbs off
them. Kara dips the bread in a goblet of wine and crams it
back into his mouth. Both bread and wine dribble down his
chin. He looks at Kara in sleepy irritation. She's just too
perky.

KARA
Come on. Time's awasting.

She hustles behind him, slapping a wet cloth on his back. He
yelps his first word of the morning.

KARA
Well, good morning to you too! Too cold?

Bowen snatches the cloth from her and wipes the sleep from
his eyes.

BOWEN
Too fast! What's the hurry?
84

KARA
There's much to be done. Troops to
train, strategy to plan, crises to be
solved.

BOWEN
(pulls on his jerkin)
What crises?

Kara grabs his jaw in her hand and, mushing up his cheeks,
jerks his face back and forth,

KARA
That beard, for one. It could use a
trim.

She holds up her axe. Bowen grabs her arm.

KARA
Don't worry, you taught me well.

BOWEN
To cut throats, not to shave them!

KARA
(shrugs)
Well, if you don't want to look like a
victorious general...

BOWEN
I'm not yet! Don't be overconfident.

KARA
You're my confidence! I've never been
more sure of anything in my life! Come!

She takes his hand and yanks him toward the tent exit.

EXT. BOWEN'S TENT - REBEL CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON

HQ TENT...waiting there is a delegation of chiefs and
generals lead by Gilbert and Hewe. Many other warriors and
villagers crowd about. Before the tent is a cross-pole
covered by a heavy cloth.

KARA
Tomorrow we will look to you... glowing
at our head like a shining beacon...

She gestures to the draped poles. Hewe whip off the
cloth...revealing A BEAUTIFUL SET OF GLISTENING ARMOR. The
emblem on the breastplate is Draco's golden profile. Gilbert
hands him the helmet. Bowen admires it in stunned awe.
85

KARA
They made it for you...All of them, out
of old kettles and plows and horseshoes
-..Gilbert designed it. Hewe hammered and
polished it. And over your heart...Draco
as the emblem of your courage.

Bowen is touched. His fingers lightly caress the golden
profile of Draco.

GILBERT
It was all Kara's idea.

KARA
A knight's armour should be as bright as
his honour.

AN OLD WOMAN emerges from the crowd and, in silent reverence,
touches Bowen's face. Others then reach out to touch him.
Warrior, women, children. All press close to touch him or
give a word of thanks. Speechless, overcome with emotion,
Bowen bolts to his tent.

INT. TENT - REBEL CAMP - DUSK

Outside, they shout for him. Bowen stares at the helmet in
his trembling hands.

KARA (0S)
Shall I help you put it on?

Bowen turns. Kara stands there with the rest of the armour.

BOWEN
Please...

He attends to the arm guards while she fastens the leggings.
He feels her soft hands on his calves. So close. So
beautiful. She helps him on with the breastplate.

KARA
How fast your heart beats...

BOWEN
They expect much.

KARA
They will give much.

BOWEN
And if I don't lead them to victory?

KARA
Then you'll have lead them farther than
they ever dared go before...

She steps back to inspect him.
86

KARA
There. All done.

BOWEN
Not quite. It is custom to bestow a
favour on a knight.

KARA
A favour?

BOWEN
A veil or a scarf that he wears into
battle as a token from his lady.

KARA
Bo you have a lady?

BOWEN
I should be honoured to wear your favour.

KARA
I...I have no such finery. I'm not a
lady. I'm a peasant.

BOWEN
You are the woman I love.

Kara stiffens at this blunt confession. Thrilled by it, but
frightened by it. He gently turns her to him.

KARA
I can give no favour. I can give
nothing. Lost honour can be recovered,
not so lost youth. The one thing that was
mine to give Einon stole forever.

BOWEN
No...not your heart...

Kara looks into his eyes, bright with love. She takes her
father's HEADBAND from around her neck and ties it to his
arm. He leans down and kisses her.

EXT. THE FIELDS - DAY

Brok rides through a field, his Falcon perched on his arn.
TWO BEATERS marching before him flush A COVEY OF DOVES from
the undergrowth.

BROK (0S)
Hungry, Pet...?

He removes the hood from his Falcon's head.

BROK
Eat...
87

He watches the Falcon soar skyward with bloodthirsty
amusement and, spurring his horse, he follows the flight of
birds over....

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - WAR CAMP - DAY
.-.the crest of the ridge. In the valley below, Brok sees...

THE REBEL CAMP...teeming with well-armed peasants as far as
the eye can see. A SUDDEN ROAR echoes out over the valley.
It is an ALARUM that alert the entire camp to readiness. BROK
suddenly sees...

BOWEN...ride out on his charger. He turns back and signals
to Gilbert, Hewe with a small body of armed men behind them.
He also signals to...

DRACO...perched on the rocky cliff rising up out of the grove
behind the village, roaring out his alarum again. This is
enough for...

BROK...who gazes at the dragon with startled eyes, then at
Bowen charging up toward him. Brok whips his horse around
and takes off the way he came..

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

Brok tears into the castle gates.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

GALLOPING WARRIORS ride into a castle courtyard, bustling
with war preparations. Weapons are cached. Food and
provisions are stored. Guards prowl the battlements.

EINON (OS)
I'm served by fools and dolts!

INT. EINON'S CASTLE - WAR-ROOM - DAY
Einon is in council with his lords and generals.

EINON
Peasants fleeing right under your noses.
And taking my grain and livestock with
them!

FELTON
But how could we know, Your Majesty? A
few peasants here and there...

BROK
A few, fop? Hundreds! Armed and
spoiling for a fight!
88

FELTON
Then let them have it! One of us is
worth a hundred of them. Are you afraid,
Sir Brok?

With a snarl, Brok almost charges across the table at Felton,
but Einon slams him back and smiles calmly at Felton, patting
his cheek.

EINON
My brave Felton. A regiment unto himself.

Einon slams Felton down on the table onto a clutter of maps.

EINON
Idiot! I know this man who leads them.
(shouts to all)
And I will beat him! But I will not
underestimate him! And do not forget the
dragon.

AISLINN (0S)
Fear not the dragon, my son.

AISLINN...stands silhouetted in the doorway and crosses to
him.

EINON
I fear nothing. Nothing! Do you
understand?
He pulls her aside.
EINON

It's just that...sometimes I sense him.
Feel him. As though he were close. But
be clear. I don't fear him!

AISLINN
No need to, my son...

She motions him to follow her outside. Curious, he does.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

Einon follows his mother out. She gestures to the courtyard
below. FIVE BURLY TARTARS, all armed to the teeth, stand in
the courtyard below.

AISLINN
A mother's gift to her son...Uhlric,
Volney, Jugurtha, and the brothers Odolf
and Oram. The finest to be had.

The Five all bow. Einon looks from the men to his mother.
89

EINON
Finest what...?

AISLINN
Dragonslayers.

Struck by this uncharacteristic kindness, Einon's disbelief
slowly shifts to sly amusement. Aislinn returns her son's
smile. He impulsively grabs his mother's hand and kisses it.

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - REBEL CAMP - MAGIC HOUR
A guardpost BONFIRE burns brightly as Bowen approaches it,

carrying something in hand. It is his DRAGON-HORNED SHIELD.
He casts it into the flame. It burns furiously with an

-almost SUPERNATURAL LIGHT...LIKE MAGNESIUM. Brilliant glows

spark and flare off the burning horns.

DRACO (0S)
Well done.

Bowen turns to see Draco behind hin.

. BOWEN
A knight of the Old Code needs no such
adornment.
DRACO
(agrees)

No...It burns brightly.

BOWEN
Like a promise of hope.

DRACO
No, Bowen, your hope lies down there.

Draco nods to...

THE VALLEY..-below. It is alive with the cookfires gleaming
in the twilight. We hear singing, children crying, laughter.
All the sounds of life going on.

DRACO
The one I've waited for. Man must now
make of the world what he can...The day
of dragons is done.

BOWEN
Not done for you. If we are victorious
tomorrow, we'll have need of you.
90

DRACO
You'll have victory, but no need of me.
Listen to them, Knight of the Old Code,
The Once-ways are in their songs and
their laughter and the cries of their
children. Listen and look.

Draco's voice is strangely cryptic and wistful. Bowen looks
at him in suspicious concern.

BOWEN
What do you see?

DRACO
Everything. It yours now.

His sad eyes turn once more to the bonfire and the brightly
burning dragon shield. Its glow becomes...

EXT. KARA'S VILLAGE - DAY

+.-The DRACO EMBLEM on Bowen's armour glinting gold in the
sunlight. Tied to his arm is Kara's favour. He is at the
head of his ARMY. Draco's image is also on the banners
flapping gloriously in the morning breeze.

IN SEVERAL SHOTS AND ANGLES, THE CAMERA CATCHES the motley,
but proudly determined army as it MARCHES out of camp. Kara
and Gilbert ride by Bowen's side. Hewe, foot, marches at the
head of the troop with the other "GENERALS". Hewe glances
up. Others follow his gaze as...

DRACO...swoops overhead. He dips a wing in salute.
BOWEN...acknowledges Draco's salute with a raised sword as
the dragon banks left in the direction of Einon castle.
ANGLE DOWN ON ARMY

As they, too, raise their weapons in salute to the dragon,
whose SHADOW ripples over then,

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - FOREST EDGE - ON ARROWS -DAY

A VOLLEY OF FIRE ARROWS SHOOT through the sky, bouncing
harmlessly off the castle wall and sputtering out. CAMERA
PANS TO:

A SMALL TROOP OF REBELS...shabby and pitiful, led by Bowen,
down in the field before the castle have fired the arrows. A

MERE FRACTION OF THE REBEL FORCE. LAUGHTER RIPPLES DOWN FROM
ABOVE.
91

EINON (0S)
(laughing)
Seems you overestimated their numbers,
Brok.

EXT, EINON'S CASTLE - BATTLEMENTS - DAY

Einon, Brok, Felton and others observe the puny rebel force
as another PATHETIC VOLLEY OF FIRE ARROWS plunk against the
parapet wall. ONE ARROW actually makes it over the wall.
Einon calmly reaches out and catches it in mid-air in his
gauntletted hand. He blasely inspects it.

EINON
And twelve years hasn't improved their
ain.

Felton chuckles and smirks at Brok.

FELTON
They'll get bored and go home before
dark.

EINON

Why wait? We'll send you out to chase
them off. After all, "One of us is worth
a hundred of them." The numbers seem
about right.

Felton gulps uneasily as Einon wags the fire arrow in his
face. But a worried Brok is unamused, ominously scanning the
sky.

BROK
There were more! And where's the...?

Brok chokes on the question as the answer comes in view...
DRACO...suddenly flies out of the sunlight and, swooping
down, sprays the battlements with fire, sending soldiers
screaming and leaping to safety. As Einon and his generals
also dash for cover, they look up to see...

DRACO...flying out of the smoke of the explosion.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - FIELD - DAY

In a field between the castle walls and the forest masses the
peasant army, BOWEN and HEWE at its head. The rebels cheer
as Draco rains more flame down on the denizens of the castle.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

THE DRAGONSLAYERS manuever a LARGE CATAPULT THAT SHOOTS
HARPOONS into place, scanning the sky for...
92

DRACO...who suddenly swoops up from behind the castle wall,
surprising the Dragonslayers who abandon there catapult as
Draco looses a firebomb at them.

As the catapult swerves, Volney is knocked against the
triggering mechanism, discharging the harpoon which goes
flying and strikes...

A STUNNED JUGURTHA...right through his chest, impaling him to
the wall. His giant axe, still gripped in his hand, knocks a
soldier off the battlements, sending him plummet ing to the
ground at the feet of...

EINON'S HORSE...the young king is mounted, at the head of
armoured knights. The horse rears as Einon frowns at the dead
soldier, then at the blazing catapult on the battlement.

EINON
Oh, lovely...

He draws his sword and shouts to his men.
EINON
Well, do we stay in here like sitting
ducks or crush those rebellious dogs?
Brok leads a chorus of war-cries. And as the gates are
opened, Einon and his mounted horse, followed by foot
soldiers, pour out of the castle, watched by...

AISLINN...from a tower window. Einon and his men rush the
peasants who retreat for the forest. She glances up at...

DRACO...hovering above, oblivious to the spears of the
Dragonslayers, watching the peasants run...almost smiling.
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - THE FIELD - DAY

The peasants retreat without a blow being struck. Einon,
spies Bowen in the rout. He laughs deliriously.

EINON
After them! Shear them like the sheep
they are.

And Einon and his riders give chase into the woods.

EXT. FOREST BATTLEFIELD - DAY
BUT EINON HAS MADE A TACTICAL MISTAKE.

As soon as all the king's riders are wheeling admidst the
trees, Bowen wheels his horse on a rise.

BOWEN
Now!
93

Behind Einon's calvary, A REBEL swings by on a rope out of a
tree, a FLAMING FAGGOT IN HIS HANDS. He dips the torch ina
TRENCH filled with PITCH. The fire runs across the forest
and up both sides creating a U-shaped barrier boxing in the
knights.

The horses panic as the walls of flame rise around them.
Then they descend...

HUNDREDS OF PEASANTS...Bowen motions them forward with his
sword and they charge en masse. Panicked knights try to jump
their horses through the flames as pikemen pick knights off
horses and the swordmen and axe-wielders fall upon them.

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON EINON as he realizes his mistake but
‘assumes comand.

EINON
Scatter or die!

Einon leaps his horse over the fire. Others follow his
example as his force splits up in the forest and comes face-
to-face with more rebel mischief.

Barrages of arrows fly out of bushes and trees picking men
off. More rebels lie in wait in the forest.

The peasant assault is swift and surprising and deadly. As
men are dvided and trapped, overwhelming numbers of rebels
appear to finish them off in hand-to-hand combat.

THE CAMERA PANS THROUGH THE MAYHEM...

BROK...bashes through a phalanx of peasants with a mace and
chain and encounters Hewe with his quarter staff. The two
tangle it up.

ELSEWHERE...

GILBERT AND OTHER ARCHERS...perched in an archer blind watch
THREE ARMED RIDERS charge a group of rebels. With lightning
speed Gilbert notches an arrow and shoots.

THE ARROW...strikes a TAUT ROPE tied off to a tree branch and
neatly slices it in two. The rope slides through the
branches, releasing...

A LOG...suspended overhead which comes crashing down in front
of the three riders. Their horses rear up and the riders
rock off their saddles. As they tumble to the ground, the
rebels rush them.

GILBERT...crosses himself.

GILBERT
Pride goeth before a fall, brother!
94
Meanwhile below...

FELTON...sword in hand, helmetless, cowardly scurries from
tree to tree through the commotion, avoiding any fight he
can. But as he creeps around the bole of a tree, a pitchfork
is thrust at his face. He jerks back and the tines of the
fork embed in the tree trunk. Felton whirls face-to-face
with...

HIS MINX...she's gone over to the rebels! Felton's stunned
rage gives him a sudden flash of courage.

FELTON
You traitorous witch! After all, I've
spent on...
(catches himself)
«.-done for...you!

She sneers and tries to yank her pitchfork from the tree.
But before she can, Felton, brave against a helpless woman,
snaps the shaft in two with his sword blade.

The minx staggers back with the broken end. Felton advances
on her, but...

GILBERT...has spotted them and looses an arrow from his bow.
It pierces...

FELTON...in the rear. Dropping his sword, he yelps in pain.
GILBERT...also yelps for joy.

GILBERT
Turn the other cheek!

However, it is...

THE MINX...who turns Felton's other cheek, by whacking him on
the jaw with her broken shaft. The lamps go out in his eyes
and he crumples to the ground.

Elsewhere...

KARA...fights among a group of peasants and soldiers.
Whirling her axe with expert skill she holds her ATTACKER,
also wielding an axe, at bay. But she is so busily engaged,
she does not see the other two ENEMIES rushing up to help
their companion. But..

BOWEN...riding across the field does. He gallops his horse
between the two swordsmen and extending his legs, kicks both
of them into the dirt as he rides by.

He then leaps from his charging horse and rushes to Kara's
side just as she neatly dispatches her adversary and grabs
his axe as he falls. Whirling both axes, she smiles over to
Bowen.
95

KARA
Like a pudding!

BOWEN
More pudding's coming.

Kara's being rushed by two men. Bowen by three. One he
quickly dispatches and takes his sword. He grips his two
blades, Kara her two axes. Grinning grimly, shoulder-to-
shoulder, they take on all-comers.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BATTLEMENTS - DAY

Volney the Tartar supervises the loading of hideous barbed
GRAPPLING HOOKS into the bowls of THREE CATAPULTS, cranked
‘and ready.

Draco streaks right to left directly overhead. Commanding
the king's soldiers, Volney cranks the first lever.

VOLNEY
Now!

The catapults wang off in order, hurling their nasty load at
the dragon.

But Draco is a skilled warrior. He sees the missiles coming
and dodges them all. With his right hand, he catches the
last hook and, yanking viciously, he does a barrel roll out
of frame.

Back on the platform, the BOLTS fastened to the catapult give
way like driven into balsa. The catapult skews sideways and
wedges under two others. The force of Draco's pull rips up
the whole mess SMASHING into Volney and the soldiers against
the stone walls, crushing them to death and taking out a fair
piece of new masonry. Through a window arch below, Volney
hangs upside down, his eyes sightless in death...

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

Out of the smoke and confusion rides...

EINON...slicing through a band of rebels. The battle goes
badly for him. He shouts above the fray.

EINON
Retreat!

His men readily obey and scatter through the woods. He spurs
his horse and joins their flight.
96
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY

Bowen and Kara are pressed back-to-back as Einon suddenly
rides by. Both recognize him.

BOWEN
_Gilbert, stop him!

Gilbert also recognizes Einon and notches a METAL-PIERCING
ARROW. As he tautly, tensely pulls back the bow, he is
grimly aware for the first time of the full power of his
remarkable talent. But though his conscience wavers, his
bow-arm does not.

GILBERT
Thou...shalt...not...kill...

He lets fly.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - FOREST EDGE - DAY
The arrow strikes true.
Einon jerks in his saddle as the arrow pierces his mail and
imbeds deep in his heart! Staggered by the impact, he sucks
in his breath. But he does not fall. He doesn't even feel
the pain.
THE CAMERA MAKES A QUICK PAN TO:
EINON'S CASTLE...where Draco suddenly recoils in mid-air and,
grasping his chest, howls in real pain, no scam this time.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
With devastating skill, both Kara and Bowen dispatch their
enemies. For both have witnessed all... Einon taking the
arrow, Draco's screech of pain and fall.
BOWEN
Draco!

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - FOREST'S EDGE - DAY

EINON...still alive, also watching the Dragon spiral and
flutter down. He looks at the arrow in his breast and, his
eyes glinting with understanding, calmly pulls it from his
chest and smiles at its bloody tip.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

As the pain-wracked Draco flutters into range, Uhlric
springs the catapult. NETS OF IRON MESH shoot out.
97
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ THE FIELD - DAY

Einon sees the Iron Nets enfold the dragon as he topples
behind the castle walls with a groan. Realizing, what this
means, Einon spurs his horse toward the castle gates.

EINON
The Dragonslayers! Noooo!

He rides hell-bent for leather as...

BOWEN (OS)
Nooo!

EXT. FOREST - ON BOWEN AND KARA - DAY

With an anguished shout, Bowen tears down the hill for Einon.
Kara watches his furious, futile chase and exchanges a
worried glance with Gilbert, who rushes up to her. They both
look to Bowen who has given up his chase. He turns to them,
his face a mask of anguished determination.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ COURTYARD - DAY

The remaining dragonslayers...Uhlric, Odolf, and Oram... have
netted the limp form of Draco. He lies still and quiet,
several of his horns are broken off. The Dragonslayers move
in cautiously, when Draco suddenly shifts on his side,
moaning, clutching his chest.

Ulhric and the brothers swarm in on the beast. But suddenly
a wild Einon is upon them, beating them back with his sword.

EINON
No! I want it alive!

Einon grimly leers at the pain-wracked, semi-conscious Draco.

EINON
Chain it! Bind its wounds! I want it
alive...And safe!

DRACO
(whispered groan)
No...

EINON
Yes...Safe for all eternity. Fear not,
dragon, Bowen will come. A knight of the
Old Code does not abandon a comrade-in-
arms.

He laughs and departs. Draco struggles weakly under the
nets.

BUT THE CAMERA PANS UP TO...
98
AISLINN...on the battlements...gazing on Draco in solemn
concern.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Hewe and the rebels survey the carnage they have wrought.
Savouring the taste of victory. Tall and proud. Men once
more. As Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert emerge into the forest,
Hewe salutes them with an upraised sword and a smile. But
his smile vanishes when he sees their long faces.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

Einon stands on the battlements, gazing out at the forest

-below. It is dotted with THE GLOW OF THE REBEL CAMPFIRES.

Then reverberating from the castle walls comes A MOURNFUL
TRILL. Einon looks down into the courtyard below where Draco
is chained.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Draco's MELANCHOLY TRILL echoes from the castle walls out
across the night to the forest's edge where camp a dispirited
group of rebels. CAMERA PANS TO:

BOWEN...listening to Draco's sad song in anguish as Gilbert
dresses a wound on Kara's shoulder.

BOWEN
Why does he keep him alive! He must be
torturing him.

KARA
No, Einon will not torture him. He will
not harm him in any way.

Bowen turns to her, not understanding.

KARA
(remembering)
"Einon will not fall in my lifetime"
...-Draco's words to me once. I saw him
go down. No one touched him. It was
when Gilbert shot Einon.

BOWEN
What are you saying?

GILBERT
When my arrow pierced Einon's heart that
was when Draco screamed and fell.

Bowen stares at them in dumbfounded disbelief, refusing to
contemplate what is being suggested.
99

KARA
Don't you see? It's the heart. The
Dragon's heart. For Einon to die, Draco
must die! :

BOWEN
No! No...Gilbert must have missed.
(fiercely)
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters
except that Draco is still alive.

Bowen hops up on a stump and shouts to his men.

BOWEN
I go to save the Dragon. Who goes with
me?

No rush to volunteer. Just muttered oaths and sullen faces.
Bowen turns in disgust to find Kara holding out his sword.

KARA
You do not go alone.

GILBERT
No...not alone...

GILBERT...who plops his helmet on his head.

Bowen slides the sword into his scabbard. Hewe and the others
watch in silent shame, as the three march off.

EXT. COURTYARD - EINON'S CASTLE - NIGHT

Draco lies heavily chained in a dark courtyard. His back
feet and front paws are shackled tightly to the ground, as is
his tail, allowing almost no movement. His neck and head are
also chained down to keep him from breathing fire on his
restraints. His chin upon the cold stone, he can only look
at the wall straight ahead of him...or out of the corner of
his eye, where he sees...

UHLRIC...on guard, appraising Draco, spitting with distaste.
Then he hears...A FOOTSTEP. Challenging with his spear,
Uhlric recognizes a DIM FIGURE in the shadow.

UHLRIC
Oh...Come for a peek at the royal pet?

Suddenly, Uhlric's eyes widen in surprise. A KNIFE flashes
out of the dark in the shadow's hand.

ON DRACO

He hears a STRANGLED GASP. Uhlric WEAVES INTO VIEW, grasping

his throat. He collapses to the ground. His spear rolls
from his lifeless fingers almost to Draco's snout.
100
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees the Shadow.
DRACO
Come from the shadows, Aislinn. Stand
where I can see you.

Aislinn comes forth. Sheathing her bloodstained dagger.
Gazing down on the man she killed. Then at Draco.

AISLINN
You know why I've come?
DRACO
I know.
AISLINN

A sorry end...

DRACO
The only end. In giving my heart, I have
taken on every pain and poison stirring
in his black breast. Even the pain of
his death must be mine. Too long I've
waited...

AISLINN
(sits by him)
No one would blame you...Death without
immortality.

DRACO
That was not the only reason...To rid the
world of Einon, would not rid it of evil.
I had to wait. Wait for a time when
mankind would not repeat my sin and let
tyranny thrive. When there would be
those who remembered the Once-ways.
Remembered that even in the darkness
there is still light and those who watch
over them...I cannot see. Are the stars
shining tonight?

AISLINN
(weeping)
Brightly, my lord, brightly.

DRACO
Then there is light enough. My soul need
not flicker above.

AISLINN
It is my sin, Dragon Lord, for a mother's
misguided heart, you gambled eternity and
lost...Forgive me.

Aislinn rises. Picks up Uhlric's spear. It is heavy, but
she manages. But suddenly A HAND tears the spear from
Aislinn's grasp. Einon's hand!
101

EINON
I know why you brought me the dragon-
slayers, Mother. You wanted them to kill
him. You wanted me dead.

AISLINN
I wanted to correct a mistake made years
ago when I saved a creature not worth
saving.

EINON
How unmotherly of you.

His voice is like ice, but Aislinn does not flinch.
DRACO...eyes filled with terror, watches...
DRACO'S POV

TWO SHADOWS on the wall, one raising a SHADOW SPEAR to strike
the other.

DRACO (0S)
No-o-o-o!
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BASE OF OUTSIDE WALL - NIGHT
Kara leads Gilbert and Bowen to the hole in the wall's rocky
foundation. As they are about to enter, Draco's wailing
lament echoes from inside. The three exchange a worried
glance and dart into the passage.

INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

Kara leads Bowen and Gilbert into the cistern from the
passageway. Bowen charges for the courtyard door.

KARA
Not that way. Too dangerous.

HEWE (OS)
Then that's our way.

Bowen and the others wheel around to see...
HEWE...and a SMALL BAND OF MEN enter the secret passage.
HEWE
We've got to open the gates for rest of
us waiting outside.

Touched by this loyalty, Bowen warmly claps Hewe on shoulder.

HEWE
Go save your dragon.
102

He opens the door that leads to the castle grounds and,
taking a cautionary peek, motions his men out. Kara points
to the other stairwell.

KARA
This leads to the castle. We can see the
whole courtyard from there.

Bowen starts up, but Kara holds him back. Their eyes meet.
Both know this may be the last quiet moment they share. She
tightens her "favour" on his arm.

KARA
You carry my favour. Carry this too...

She leans up and kisses him. Bowen enfolds her in his arms.

INT. BEDCHAMBER - EINON'S CASTLE - NIGHT

The secret passage opens. Bowen, Kara, and Gilbert creep
in...only to find Einon comfortably sprawled on the bed.

EINON
What a pleasant surprise. I expected
you, Knight. But my bride-to-be, as
well? And with a priest to wed us.

BOWEN
To bury you, Einon.

Blade out, Bowen charges, stabbing only the bedclothes, as
Einon whirls off the bed, arrogantly grinning.

EINON
Well, to bury one of us!

His blade meets Bowen's in mid-air. And the two engage in
fast and furious swordplay. The clanging blades attract TWO
GUARDS outside the chamber. Gilbert and Kara intercept their
charge as Bowen and Einon duel near the fireplace. Einon is
good. Very good. Bowen has taught him well. He ducks a
slash of Einon's blade and executes an athletic drop-kick
against the king that sends him careening down the stairwell
of the secret passageway. Bowen leaps down after him.

Kara, dispatching her guard, begins to follow Bowen and
Einon. But Gilbert, the sword not being his weapon, is hard-
pressed and she goes to his aid instead.

INT. EINON'S CASTLE - CISTERN- NIGHT

Einon rumbles down the stone steps and slumps lifelessly
there. Bowen rushes dwn on the limp form...

---and nearly gets decapitated, as Einon's eyes flick open
and he lunges.
103

Angered, Bowen attacks with a wild sally. Einon, confident
in his invincibility, cooly deflects the blade and forces
Bowen back into the cistern.

EINON
Practice what you preach, mentor.
Purpose, not passion, remember?

The jibe only intensifies Bowen's reckless assault.

EINON
Nerve cold blue...

Taunting, Einon nimbly ducks a vicious swipe, executes a
swift thrust that scores a vicious slash across Bowen's calf.

EINON
«.+.Blade blood red.

Bowen ducks a vicious thrust and nearly loses his balance at
the edge of the cistern pool. As he teeters there, Einon
takes a savage swipe, but this time it is Bowen who flips
away...over the water on the other side of the cistern. Even
Einon's impressed. He barks a laugh.

EINON
Still have a few lessons to teach me,
mentor?

BOWEN

Just one more.

EINON
What, pray, is that?

BOWEN
The last one your father learned.

The wound has renwed Bowen's cool vigor. He is calm and hard
as he drives Einon up into a dark cistern tunnel. All that
can be seen in the blackness are the blue sparks of the
clanging blades.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ A STAIRWELL ~- NIGHT

A cringing FELTON flattensd against a staircase wall. Rapid
steps descend and Kara appears, gripping her axe, trying to
decide which way to go.

Felton, realizing his enemy is only a woman, sweeps out of
the shadows like a spider, his sword at her throat as he
leers triumphantly over her shoulder.

FELTON
This will put me in good with his
majesty.
104

HEWE (0S)
I doubt it.

A quarterstave crashes down on his head. The lamps go out in
his eyes and, as his blade slides harmlessly away from Kara,
he crumples slack-jawed to the ground. Kara wheels to find
Hewe standing over the collapsed Felton.

KARA
I'm in your debt.
HEWE
I'm in yours. Your father would be

proud.

They continue on their seperate ways.

EXT. CASTLE STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Einon drives Bowen up a castle stairwell. The knight is
hard-pressed, but holding his own.

EINON
We know each other's every move. But I'm
younger and faster.

BOWEN
I'll slow you so you won't get any older.

The duellists fight their way up the stairs.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - BATTLEMENTS ~ NIGHT

Kara, axe in hand, whirls onto a battlement through the
wreckage of the dragonslayers' catapults. She turns to get
her bearings straight and sees A HUGE SHADOW looming on the
wall behind her, hoisting a HUGE SHADOW SWORD..

Kara wheels around to confront Brok, but her axe is no match
for Brok's heavy descending sword. The impact tears the
weapon from her hand and sends her careening into the dead
dragonslayer, Jugurtha, still impaled on the wall.

She snatches THE GIANT AXE still cluthced in his dead hand
and jerks the heavy shaft with two hands to fend off Brok's
blade,

But the sword slices right through the shaft. The weight of
the axe jerks Kara to safety. The blade whizzes by her.
Brok wheels, Kara swings the butt of the broken axe-pole up
against Brok's shield, It cracks him under the jaw and
throws him off-guard. She twirls the axe, blade up, and
thrusts it up between Brok's legs. He crumbles to the
ground, devastated.
105

BROK
A girl?...a girl?

Kara jerks the axe from the corpse.

KARA
Like a pudding.

EXT. CASTLE GATES - NIGHT

Hewe and his marauders descend upon the guards, slaying them
and opening the gate...only to find AN OUTER GATE beyond.
Also guarded. Before Hewe's men can cut them down, one
SENTRY blows ALARUM on a Ram's horn.

EXT, CASTLE TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Bowen and Einon ascend the tower steps, blades flashing
furiously. They've heard the alarum. Bowen grins.

BOWEN
My rebels are storming your castle.

EINON
Pity you won't live to see them fail.

Einon's blade nearly slices off an ear. Angered, Bowen
manuevers Einon around and proceeds to back him up the
stairs.

EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT

Hewe and his band are beset by Einon's SOLDIERS as they
struggle with the gate. But suddenly, several GUARDS pitch
forward,slain by a rapid volley of arrows fired by...

GILBERT...Hewe smiles and salutes him with a wave. Then the
gates open and, with wild war shouts, the REBELS pour in.

EXT. COURTYARD - ON DRACO - NIGHT

Odolf, in the courtyard, looks to Oram on the parapet. Both
grip their spears in edgy tenseness, reacting to the sounds
of battle, the fight up the tower, and Draco's writhing

agony. His arm GLOWS A THROBBING RED where Bowen cut Einon,

EXT. TOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Bowen and Einon burst through the door into a half-crumbled
TOWER-ROOM. It is roofless, most of it's walls destroyed,
open to the elements. Its vantage point gives us a
spectacular view of the whole castle and the country beyond.
And Draco chained in the courtyard below.
106

They duel over and around building materials and scaffolding,
locked in fierce combat. Sparks fly from their clanging
blades. Bowen presses Einon hard.

BOWEN
(cold hate)
Once you held this sword in a sacred
oath, which you broke. Now embrace it
again.

Bowen swipes a wicked thrust that Einon barely sidesteps.
Bowen blade cracks against a piece of masonry. Einon whirls
in with no mercy. Bowen tosses his broken hilt at Einon and
dives into a clutter of scaffolding. Einon chops and hacks
at it sending splintered chips flying as he tries to finish
Bowen off. He laughs in malicious glee, eyes glinting like a
“madman.

EINON
Fool! You lost before you began. I am
immortal!

Bowen leaps up, twirling onto a crossbeam, out and over
Einon, who spins to cut him down before he lands.

KARA
Bowen!

Kara has appeared on the roof and throws her axe to Bowen,
still in mid-air. Catching it, he lands and catches Einon
blade on it. Einon is jarred back and Bowen sends the axe
flying. It shrieks through the air, just missing Einon's
head and burying itself in the heavy wooden shutter of a
window in a partially rebuilt wall. still off-balance, Einon
strikes. Bowen leaps the thrust and jumps onto the low sill
to yank his axe free. It won't budge.

Einon snarls a laugh and lunges. Bowen pushes off from the
sill and, clinging to the axe-handle, rides the shutter as it
swings out. Einon cannot stop his momentum and he spills out
of the window into space.

EXT. TOWER - NIGHT -

As Einon's body tumbles from the window, crashes through
scaffolding, sending building materials as well as himself
careening down on top of and into the cistern in a cacophony
of clatter, clutter, and dust.

INT. CISTERN - NIGHT

As Einon along with wreckage, plunges beneath the surface of
the water.
107
INT. TOWER ROOM - NIGHT

Kara dashes to the window, as Bowen clings to his axe-handle
on the swinging shutter. Both look down.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE -THEIR POV - CISTERN - NIGHT

Einon has disappeared into the watery depths beneath the
wreckage of scaffolding and cistern.

EXT. TOWER ROOM - WINDOW SHUTTER - NIGHT
Bowen looks over at Kara.

BOWEN
So much for his immortality.

But echoing below comes Draco's AGONIZED GROAN! Bowen calls
to the dragon, whose pain-wracked body GLOWS RED TORMENT.

BOWEN
Draco!

Just then...the axe gives in the shutter! Then unwedges
itself and Bowen falls out into space.

KARA
Bowen!

But he doesn't go far. He has grabbed hold of a PULLEY-LINE
that is attached to the tower and is fast spiralling down to
the courtyard below...and Draco!

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Odolf, realizing Einon's dead, wheels on the chained dragon
and, grinning, utters a war-cry and charges with his spear.
But he suddenly hears something behind him. It is...

BOWEN...riding the pulley~line down and swooping in on Odolf
from behind. Odolf holds up his spear to block the
descending axe. But the blade slices through the shaft and
buries itself in Odolf's chest. A WAIL OF GRIEF AND OUTRAGE
echoes from...

THE BATTLEMENTS...where ORAM, having witnessed his brother's
death, pulls his bow string taut. But before he can unleash
his arrow, Draco's nostril shoots a SPRAY OF FLAME that
engulfs the dragonslayer, the impact knocking him off the
parapet with an agonizing scream, as..

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - OUTER WALLS - ORAM - NIGHT

«+ehis body, a spiralling fireball, plummets down the wall
and down the mountain.
108
EXT. EINON'S CASTLE - NIGHT

Bowen pilfers the keys off Odolf's belt and starts to unlock
the shackles about Draco's neck. Draco stretches his neck.

DRACO
You should have let them do it. Now you
must.

BOWEN
What?

Kara arrives in the courtyard from the tower, overhearing
Draco.

DRACO
Even as the heart binds Einon to me in
life, it binds us in death.

BOWEN
That is not true.

DRACO
You've seen that it is. Through the
heart we share each other's pains and
power. But in my half beats the Life
Source. For Einon to die, I must die.

BOWEN
(refusing to believe)
Einon is dead! Tell him, Kara!

But Kara can't. She is uncertain. She knows what she's
seen. But she also knows Draco.

KARA
I...1...don't know...

BOWEN
You saw it!

DRACO
He lives!

Bowen is desperate.
BOWEN

It doesn't matter!

{gestures to the

battle noise)
Don't you hear it? Our rebels...our
silly, sorry little band of rebels have
stormed the castle. Alive or dead,
Einon's beaten. We've won!
109

DRACO
You will never win until Einon's evil is
destroyed. And to do that, you must
destroy me!

BOWEN
No!

DRACO
Once you swore your sword and service
were mine. To call when I had need of
you. To ask what I would of you. I ask
now! I need now. I hold you to your

vow, Knight!

Suddenly Draco's sixth sense picks up something. He winces in
‘pain, hissing breathlessly.

DRACO
He's coming! Coming to stop you!

Bowen frantically whirls to the wreckage. But there is
nothing. No one.

DRACO
Strike before it's too late!
BOWEN
(torn)
You're the last!
DRACO
My time is over. Strike!
BOWEN
You're my friend!
DRACO
Then as my friend, Strike! Please!
BOWEN
I can't! I can't send you soulless into
Hell!
DRACO
(snarling)

Then I will make you!

With a roar, Draco lunges at Bowen with his snapping fangs.
Bowen evades the blow. Again, Draco lashes out, trying to
provoke Bowen, but again the knight dodges the sharp teeth.

DRACO
Fight back, Dragonslayer!
110

Once more, Draco dives at him with his flashing fangs. Bowen
leaps out of the shackled dragon's range. Rattling his
chains wildly, Draco shoots a jet of flame at Bowen. Kara
screams, but Bowen holds ground, as the flamess just misses.

DRACO
Defend yourself!

Bowen flings the axe to the ground, near the wreckage of the
cistern. Draco shoots another bolt of fire. This one
closer. Bowen recoils.

DRACO
Pick it up!

His chest heaves out ready to spew more fire.

KARA
No! TI will do it!

She runs for the axe. Bowen moves to stop her.

BUT SOMEONE ELSE STOPS HER,

EINON!...suddenly leaping up out of the wreckage of the
cistern and scaffolding. Bloody and battered but very much
alive! Draco wails in misery.

Einon grabs Kara by the arm and whirls her to him, sword
blade at her throat. Bowen snatches up the axe and hoists it
back, aimed at Draco.

EINON
Move and she dies!

STALEMATE. Bowen freezes...until...
DRACO...viciously sinks his fangs into his chained claw.

But it is Einon who FEELS THE FANGS. In his sword hand. The
blade clatters to the stone as he recoils...and...

BOWEN...in that instant realizes WHAT HE MUST DO. He yanks
Kara from Einon's grasp and, shoving her to safety, spins
around, back to Einon, and raises the axe to strike...

DRACO...exposing his breast for the blow; his scales falling
back, revealing his scar. But...

EINON...is already pulling his knife from his belt to plunge
into Bowen's neck.

EINON
Only expose your back to a corpse!

His blade comes down, but...
lil

THE AXE...leaves Bowen's hand and, twirling in the air,
buries itself in Draco's scarred breast.

KARA...stifles a scream as...

DRACO...reels. Suddenly his old wound SHIMMERS BRILLIANTLY.
Then it FADES TO DULLNESS once more as Draco falls, his
grateful eyes staring into the anxious face of...

BOWEN...his own eyes flood with tears, wheeling on...

EINON...who staggers, clutching his chest. His eyes filled
with stunned disbelief. His mouth agape in a silent scream.
As he lunges forward, Bowen, sneering through tear-dimmed
eyes, grabs Einon's upraised knife and folds it under,
jamming the blade into Einon's chest. Momentum carries
-king's body over the top of Bowen.

BOWEN
You are a corpse.

Einon flops down beside Draco and, with a strangled groan,
his eyes close. Just a brief second before Draco's own dim
and close, with one last GRATEFUL LOOK at...

BOWEN...who sees Draco SMILE BEATIFICALLY as his eyelids
flutter down. Going to his final rest with SERENE PEACE OF A
SAINT. Bowen kneels forlornly over Draco's still body. Kara
joins the vigil, oblivious to the ringing shouts of victory
elsewhere in the castle.

Hewe, Gilbert, and a vanguard of the rebels rush in
and...seeing the dragon, their jubiliation is quickly forgot.
Gilbert joins his friends, crossing himself. The others enter
in solemn reverence for their dead comrade and their grieving
commander. They drift silently in from everywhere, filling
the courtyard and the battlements.

BOWEN
(anguished)
What now, Dragon?! You abandon us alone
in our freedom! Without you, what do we
do? Where do we turn...?

DRACO (VO)
To the stars, Bowen. To the stars...

The VOICE is a whisper, warm and reassuring. Bowen turns to
Kara. She's also heard it. So has Gilbert. ALL HAVE HEARD
IT. NONE WILL FORGET IT. Bowen turns back to...

DRACO...AN EERIE, ETHEREAL GLOW OF TRANSLUCENT IRRIDESCENCE
oozes out of his wound like a strange, glowing mist covering
his corpse. Then it spreads out over the ground. Draco's
body dissolves in the mist, becomes one with it, as the
strange glow begins to float upward. Past Bowen, Kara, and
Gilbert, past...

THE REBELS...Their awed faces awash in the ethereal glow as
it rises above the castle walls and...

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ SKY - NIGHT

...out into the night. The LIGHT swiftly swirls behind the
mountains and suddenly the night becomes alive with CELESTIAL
COLOUR...an AURORA BOREALIS OF FIREWORK FLASH. Then echoing
on the air, comes DRACO'S DRAGONSONG, sweet, clear, and
joyous.

EXT. COURTYARD - EINON'S CASTLE - ON BOWEN - NIGHT

Bowen gazes heavenward. Expectant. Waiting. Smiling. A
-strange look on his face. A knowledge in his eye. A
PERCEPTION. Gilbert and Kara wonder what he sees. If he's
mad with grief. They look from him to...

EXT. STARRY SKY - NIGHT

As the Light behind the mountains spins and concentrates into
a shimmering STREAK, lancing through the darkness. The stars
suddenly DIM, fading from the sky as the strange light shoots
across night's black curtain toward...

THE CONSTELLATION DRACO...where the streak of light ERUPTS
into a BLAZING STAR whirling with dazzling splendour into the
formation, becoming the eye of the constellation.

The whole constellation sparkles and, for an instant, A
PROFILE OF DRACO, looms along the outline of the
constellation. But just for an instant, then fading along
with Draco's song as the other stars return to the heaven.

EXT. EINON'S CASTLE ~ COURTYARD - ON BOWEN - NIGHT

Smiling. Kara hugs Bowen. Gilbert crosses himself. All
stare transfixed...

EXT. STARRY SKY ~ ON THE CONSTELLATION - NIGHT

The new star glitters brilliantly...more vivid, more lustrous
than the others, its' gleaming rays beaming out to and down
upon...

EXT. COURTYARD - EINON'S CASTLE - NIGHT

BOWEN...And Kara and Gilbert...their upturned faces bathed in
its glow. A trio of stillness amidst the raucous celebration
of their fellows. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. UP. The noise
grows dimmer. And the light that frames them grows more
intense.

AND THE CAMERA CONTINUES BACK.

GILBERT (VO)
This is the tale of a Knight who slew a
dragon and vanquished evil.

The three look very small now. Seen from above. As all
things must look from Heaven. All that keeps them from
blending into the rest of the surging mass is the beam of
starshine that falls down upon them. Smiles upon them. And
seems to gleam ever brighter. And brighter. Until the dark
is swept away and all is...

EXQUISITE LIGHT!

‘FADE OUT.
