CHILDREN'S VOICES sing the haunting strains of a Dies Irae --
that pert cf the Requiem Mass which prophecies Judgment Day.

FADE IN. CREDITS OVEPF:
A SERIES OF STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

portraying a pageant of MEDIEVAL KINGS and ARMORED KNIGHTS.
Heroes of the past commemorated forever in glass mosaic.

END ON a rendering of the most mythic warrior: ST. GEORGE.
Lance lifted, warhorse rearing, he's shown charging into
battle against his fabled foe: A GIGANTIC WINGED DRAGON.

HOLD ON this image as an ominous RUMBLING suddenly builds.
The window begins to SHAKE. PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A BULLDOZER, loudly lumbering down a street below.

We now see the windows are the facade of WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
We are in

EXT. CENTRAL LONDON - LATE AFTERNOON

SUPERIMPOSE: WESTMINSTER, LONDON. THE PRESENT.

A city caught between the 12th century and the 20th; where

the medietal spires of the Tower of London compete for space

with office buildings of glass and steel.

THE BULLDOZER rumbles through the city's afternoon traffic toward a
nearby COKSTRUCTION SITE. A high barrier surrounds the site, from
which hangs A BANNER: JUBILEE LINE EXTENSION PROJECT: TAKING LONDON
INTO A NEW MILLENNIUM.

The dezer stops by the banner, lowers its bucket to the
ground. kevealed inside is a young passenger

QUINN ABESCROMBY

age 12, a“forward moving chap” just stalled on the border of
puberty. % hops out of the bucket with a nod to the DRIVER.

QUINN
Cheers, Jake.

Bookbag inone hand, some bags of fast-food in the other
Quinn entess a door in the barrier marked SITE ENTRANCE.

EXT. CONSTSUCTION SITE - LATE AFTERNOON
Quinn walksthrough the site. Around him, WORKERS labor over

a lattice d girders. Huge CRANES lift material down a FIFTY
FOOT WIDE WLE which leads to subway construction below.
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

Site forewoman KAREN ABERCROMBY stands by a table, going over
a schematic. She's a working class matron in her 40s, full
of life, sturdy as the buildings she's helped construct. Her
assistant, STUART, nudges her.

STUART
There's your man.

Karen looks up, sees Quinn approaching.

KAREN
What're you doin' without a hat?

QUINN
(Brandishing the food bags
Bringin' you supper.

Karen takes off her own hard hat, tosses it to Quinn.

QUINN (CONT'D)
! Aw, mum...

KAREN
Oh, "Mum" yourself. You know you can't
be here without protection.

STUART
Don't believe it, Quinn. If she'd had
protection, you wouldn't be here at all.

i KAREN
Watch it, mate...

A WORKMAN calls from nearby.

| WORKMAN
Karen! Jess needs you downstairs.

KAREN
Can't it wait? We're just havin' our tea.

WORKMAN
He says it's urgent.

Karen sighs, puts down the food.

QUINN
Can I come down?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

KAREN
No, love, they're still layin' in
supports.
(Kisses him on forehead.)
‘Nother time.

Karen and Stuart head to the construction hole and enter a
cage-like ELEVATOR. With a metallic THUNK, the cage descends.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Dark, recently dug walls of soft earth and clotted clay. The
entire tunnel resonates with GRINDING SOUNDS coming from

A TUNNEL BORING MACHINE ("TBM"): a steel cylinder the size of
several pick-up trucks. Its cutting edge is a series of
hydraulic rams that dig into the earth before it.

At the moment, the TBM is stuck into the earth at the
tunnel’s end. It bucks and grinds, like an animal trying to
free itself from a trap.

Karen and Stuart approach the TBM's operator cab. Inside,
JESS, a portly, choleric Irishmen, fiddles with the controls.

KAREN
All right, Jess?

JESS
Damn stuck is what I am.
(Jimmies controls)
You geniuses tol' me it was clay down
here. I'm hittin' bloody bedrock.

Karen and Stuart look at each other, confused.
KAREN
Bollocks.

(Climbs into the cab.)
There's no bedrock for miles.

JESS
Well, maybe if Your Ladyship'd learn to
read the charts.

Karen disregards him; she works the hydraulic controls. The
TBM WHIRRS, begins to unjam itself from the wall.

Stuart inspects the debris nearby. It's then he notices
A TRICKLE OF WATER running from the cut the TBM has made into

the wall. It's as if the machine has hit a water main.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

STUART
Oy, Karen! Hold...

CRASH! A GUSH OF WATER BLASTS FROM THE CUT IN THE WALL! It
SLAMS into Stuart, knocking him backward. ,

KAREN
Stuart!

Karen grabs his arm, pulls him up to the cab just as

THE GUSH BECOMES A TORRENT, PUSHING THE TBM BACKWARD, like a
cork forced from a bottle.

KAREN, STUART AND JESS cling to the TBM cab for dear life.

Then, as quick as it came, the flood subsides. Soon, the
only sound is the HISS of water STEAMING in the tunnel.

aren rises unsteadily. She stares at what lies before them.
# LARGE HOLE, punctured in the wall by the TBM.
EXT. TOP OF CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK

Unaware of the events below, Quinn sits reading a schoolbook.
A distant CLANG splits the air. He looks up.

The sound resonates from the spire of BIG BEN. It's 6:00 PM.
The famed clocktower is tolling in the coming night.

INT. HOLE IN THE TUNNEL

Holding her flashlight, Karen steps into the hole, followed
by Stuart and Jess. They can see their breath MIST with cold.

JESS
Jesus! Water's bloody freezing.

KAREN
Below freezing, mate. It's salt.

STUART
What the hell's salt water doing...?

All come to a mute halt on the other side.

KAREN
Good Christ.

REVEAL they are in
INT. A HUGE DRIPPING WET CAVERN

100 feet high, but the dark makes it seem bigger. SHADOWS of
ODDLY SHAPED TRANSLUCENT STALACTITES AND STALAGMITES haunt
the space. Eeriest of all, however, are the PINPRICKS OF
PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT that dot the ceiling and walls. Their
dim, green glow make them look like subterranean stars.

The three glance around nervously, their breath misting
eerily before them.

JESS
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.

Stuart touches the glowing stuff on the wall.

STUART
Phosphorescent algae. What do you reckon?
KAREN
Undersea cave maybe.
JESS
You daft? Ocean's miles from here.
KAREN
Yes, your Lordship. And this country was
under it.
JESS

What, ten thousand years ago?!

STUART
This must've gotten sealed off somehow.

Karen and Stuart walk forward into the cavern.

Jess, not so bold, takes a few steps back.

SQUISH. His foot falls on something soft and wet. He looks
down at what he's stepped upon:

A MASSIVE CABLE, stretching the length of the floor.
Jess touches the thing with his boot. It's then he sees
The Cable is covered with what seem to be HAIRS.

KAREN AND STUART

head into the cave. Karen trips on something. Stuart catches
her. Karen turns her light to see on what she tripped on.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

A BIZARRE FISH, prehistoric, almost alien looking, lies
motionless on the ground. Stuart bends down to look at it.

STUART (cont'd)
Jesus. Looks bloody primeval...

Suddenly the fish THRASHES OUT, its spiny body nearly
striking Stuart in the face.

STUART (cont'd)
Fuckin' hell! How can it be alive?

THUD. A FAINT SOUND like a fist hitting an empty drum echoes
through the cavern.

STUART (CONT'D)
Jess, what are you on about?

No answer. Karen flashes her light around. No sign of him.

KAREN
Jess?

Nothing. Karen and Stuart rise, calling Jess' name.
Karen heads toward one end of the chamber. She comes to

A CIRCULAR BOULDER set in the wall. 5-feet, shiny black. It
looks like an obsidian marble sunk halfway into the rock.

STUART searches his end.
ANOTHER THUD echoes through the cave, this one louder.

He shines his light ahead...and freezes. For sprawled on the
ground before him is

JESS. Eyes frozen open, blood trickling from his mouth. The
"cable" he stepped on has WRAPPED ITSELF around his chest,
CRUSHING it like a tin-can.

STUART
Karen!

Karen turns. The beam of her flashlight hits the surface of
the circular black boulder.

THE COLOR OF THE BOULDER CHANGES: DEEP BLUE appears
vertically on either end, widening so that all that's left of
the black is m angry SLIT in the middle.

It's not a barlder at all.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUEL:

Karen finds herseif staring into an 4-FOOT EYE. Unnervingiy
catlike; sky-blue iris; night-black pupil.

She barely has time to react before

SNAP! THE "CABLE" FLICKS OUT, SLAMMING Stuart against the
wall with a sickening CRACK!

KAREN
Stuart!!

She runs to him. But by that time, all hell's broken loose.
The dull echoing thuds grow louder, quicker...

MOVEMENT ail around. The strange translucent stalactites
shift one way...parts of the walls shift another...THE ENTIRE
CAVERN SEEMS TO BE ALIVE WITH A TRANSLUCENT FLESH.

The thuds are now DEAFENING AND RHYTHMICAL. The sound of a
massive HEARTBEAT.

KAREN
throws Strart over her back in a fireman's carry

SNAP! ! The "Cable" STRIKES the ground nearby. Karen dodges
with Stuart, makes for the cavern's exit.

The "Cable" does not go after them. Rather, it WRAPS itself
around TWO BOULDERS by the wall and drags them into an
OPENING ir the cavern wall.

Zn opening which we now see is a GIGANTIC MOUTH. And the
cable is its massive TONGUE.

INT. SUBWAZ TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Karen runs with Stuart over her shoulder. She comes to a
tunnel jumetion where SEVERAL WORKERS are busy.

WORKER #1
Zeren, what's...?

KAREN
Sreryone topside! NOW!

In a burst adrenaline, she books for the elevator. The
others folla.
INT. CAVERN

The boulders start RATTLING within the mouth of the unseen
Creature...like clicking flints trying to make a spark

POV - UNSEEN CREATURE
begins to move out of its cavern into the tunnel.
EXT. QUIET STREET NEAR CONSTRUCTION SITE - SUNSET

A fiery sunset is reflected in the WINDOWS of nearby shops.
Suddenly, an ALARM STARTS TO SOUND.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SUNSET
BY QUINN

The ground underneath the boy begins to TREMBLE. Quinn tries
te rise, but is literally knocked off his feet as

THE EARTH AROUND THE SITE STAPTS TO SHUDDER!

INT. CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR

CLANG! Karen SLAMS the elevator door shut. She, Stuart and
the other workers are packed in like sardines. She presses
the controls. The elevator SLOWLY begins to climb.

The tunnel’s SHAKING. In the distance, a terrible RATTLING.
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK

Workmen run for cover as girders fall around them. An ear-
piercing SCREECH OF METAL as a HUGE CRANES TOPPLES OVER.

QUINN
Mum... ?

Quinn looks toward the construction hole just as
THE ELEVATOR CAGE

rises from the hole. Quinn can see his mother and the others
caught in the cage. They're almost to safety when...

THE RATTLING BELOW BECOMES DEAFENING.

KAREN
Quinn, STAY BACK! STAY...

CRAAAAACK! AN ARC OF BLUE PHOSPHOROUS LIGHTNING BURSTS FORTH
FROM THE HOLE!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUEZD:

Karer. and the others SCREAM as the elevator cage is CONSUMED
BY FIRE SO HOT IT INCINERATES THEM.

The flaming elevator TOPPLES back into the hole.

QUINN
MUM!!!

Quinn runs to the collapsing elevator...then stops short.
For something else is coming out to greet him.

A_MAMMOTH WING

painfully unfurls from the hole. Its flesh is withered,
translucent from centuries without light. The sun shines
through it, revealing a webwork of skeletal structure.
QUINN

can cniy watch, paralyzed, as

A SECOND WING

joins the first, torturously stretching, hoisting its main
body from the hole.

As light hits the creature's skin, its color CHANGES. Like a
ghost taking form, the flesh becomes a dark, rich BLACK.

BN ENORMOUS SHADOW

takes shape on the ground: a leviathan's silhouette of two
batlike wings and a gigantic, serpentine body.

THE CREATCRE'S HUGE EYE

stares mezcilessly. For an instant, Quinn's REFLECTED in the
thing's cornea. Captured, like an insect in a glass.

QUINN

stares back in terror as the CREATURE'S SHADOW covers him. It
blots out the remainder of light, taking us into

DARKNESS:
Silence. Tten, a hollow SOUND of wind rushing through stone.

FADE IN:

A SLITTED, INHUMAN EYE

fills frame its gold-flecked iris staring evilly at us.

PULL BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL
It's only a mangy TABBY CAT, standing in the middle of
INT. A STONE ROOM

Small] as a prison cell, made entirely of ancient rock.
Dawnlight filters in from a slit in the wall.

The Cat MEOWS, trying to get the attention of

A MAN, asleep in a small cot. Dressed in fatigues, his face
turned from us, he does not seem about to get up.

The Cat jumps up on a knickknack filled SHELF above the man's
head. It MEOWS again. The Man groans into his pillow.

MAN
Bugger off, Murphy.

Undeterred, the Cat starts tapping a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH with
its paw. It pushes the object over the edge of the shelf;
the picture falls, landing a half-inch from the Man's head.
We see it's a FAMILY PHOTO: Young Quinn standing with Karen.
The Man rolls over; we see his face.

QUINN ABERCROMBY, now in his late 20s. A gentie, handsome
face, one that's lived at great cost.

Quinn picks up the photo, shakes it at the cat.

QUINN
One a these days, you're not gonna miss.

Quinn puts the photo on the shelf, then gently grabs the cat.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Then where you gonna be, eh?

He carries the cat through the room. PLANTS hang from the
wall; A GOLDFISH TANK in one corner; a CAGE with MICE in
another. An old SHEEP DOG huddles by the door.

Quinn walks to what passes for a "pantry": a small sterno
burner with an assortment of ancient food tins.

QUINN (CONT'D)
They'll try you. Convict you. Hang you.

He empties a packet of DRIED MILK into a bowl, fills it with
water from a canteen, stirs.

(CONTINUED)
il.
CONTINUED:

QUINN (CONT'D)
Probably won't even give you a last meal.

He sets the bowl on the floor. Murphy hungrily laps the milk
The Sheep Dog by the door BARKS.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Don't worry, I'm not playin' favourites.

Quinn grabs a partially burned BOOK from a rickety shelf.
Then, dog in tow, he heads out the door.

INT. STONE HALLWAY
Quinn walks through a narrow hallway of ancient rock.

A BOY AND GIRL (JARED, 11, and BETH, 9), faces stained with
soot, race around the corner and nearly knock into him.

QUINN
Oy oy oy, Jared. Keep it under fifty.

JARED
Sorry, Chief.

The children continue on with their chase-game. Yawning,
Quinn walks on past the door to

A SMALL CHAPEL

CHOIR MUSIC within, intoning a Catholic "Kyrie". We see the
source of the music is A SHORTWAVE RADIO near the lectern.
The music ends, and an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE comes over the
radio, speaking in ITALIAN.

VOICE OVER SHORTWAVE
This is Vatican station, transmitting
from temporary sanctuary in Sicilia...

Quinn crosses himself as he walks by the chapel. He heads
down a STONE STAIRCASE, which in turn opens out to

EXT. GRAND COURTYARD - MORNING

Three acres enclosed by 30 FOOT HIGH STONE WALLS. It's a
cross between a medieval village and a modern refugee camp.

PEOPLE dressed in threadbare clothes go about morning
business. Some cook on grills fueled by SOLAR BATTERIES; some
get water from wells pumped by WINDMILLS. Others tend LIVE-
STOCK roaming freely through the area. Everyone has the
lean, hungry look of wartime refugees.

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

Quinn walks by, nodding hellos. The residents' replies are
all respectful: "mornin', Chief...up early, Chief..."

He heads to the back of the yard where sits

DAVE CREEDY -- 30s, red-haired, the runt of a short litter.
His accent is Cumbrian: a dialect that sounds like a Scottish
brogue run through a blender.

He is cooking something over a coal fire as Quinn approaches.

QUINN
There's your man.

CREEDY
Give us a kiss.

QUINN
Shave.

Creedy hands him a cup of tea. Quinn looks down, sees what
his friend is cooking: a frighteningly runny CHEESE SANDWICH.

QUINN (CONT'D)
What's this then?

CREEDY
\ (Proudly)
Fookin' cheese toastie.

QUINN
"Fookin' cheese," eh?
(Inspects it.)
From a cow or your toes?

CREEDY
Try it an' see.
_ (OFF Quinn's look)
Oh, don't be "Mr. Picky-Poo". I's good
this time, I put chives in it.

Quinn regards the oozing mess, politely shakes his head.
CREEDY (CONT'D)
Since when'd you develop such a
profoun'ly delicate palatte?

QUINN
Since you found that damn cook book.

Quinn rises, walks over to a set of STAIRS leading up to
13.

EXT. TOP OF WALL - MORNING

In what is obviously a morning ritual, Quinn paces the
WALKWAY that runs the top of the wall.

He leans against the battlement, pulls out the book he took
from his shelf. It's a technical manual titled: OXYGEN UNIT
REPAIR. He starts to read.

PULL BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL he is standing on the walls of

A MEDIEVAL NORMAN CASTLE

Its ancient towers outfitted with solar panels, barbed wire
and rusting guns. Its formidable rock walls scarred with
huge black SCORCH MARKS. Wounds from a war with fire.
PANNING AWAY from the castle, we see the country it inhabits
A BURNT, DESOLATE LANDSCAPE.

Nothing standing much less living. The ground is SLICK BLACK
SLAG - as if it were burned, melted, then licked clean.

It stretches to an ever-grey sky which itself seems scorched.
SUPERIMPOSE: WARWICKSHIRE, ENGLAND. 2024 A.D.
SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

over the barren domain. All seems lifeless until we come to a
CHARRED TREE, standing like a sentinel on a hill overlooking

EXT. SEVERAL FARMING FIELDS - SOUTH OF CASTLE - DAY

Acres of color -- amber barley, green stalks of corn and
alfalfa -- all reclaimed from the sea of black.

People from the castle are busy HARVESTING. Some use decayed
bits of technology -- tractors, mowers, bailers. Others use
jury~rigged equipment pulled by animals.

Around the fields are several old WATER TENDERS ~- firetrucks
with huge water tanks and hoses. MEN IN FIREFIGHTING GEAR sit
atop them, armed with old rifles, guns, even crossbows.

They scan the cloud-covered sky, watching for signs of life.
INT. CASTLE - CHAPEL - LATER

A group of twenty STUDENTS aged four to twelve sit raptily
watching Quinn, who is acting out a story for them.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

QUINN

(In a deep basso.)
“Join me" the Black Knight says, "and we can end
this destructive conflict together."

(In a younger voice.)
"I'll never join you!" The White Knight
cries. "You killed my father!" But the
Knight in Black only stares at him,
stares through the buggy eyes of his
black mask. And then he speaks the words
that burn into our hero's heart forever.

(In deep basso.)
"No, Luke. JI am your father...

The kids GASP at the revelation.

JARED
You make that one up, Mr. Quinn?

QUINN
I did.

The Kids MUMBLE, impressed. Quinn winks at FAITH, 17, a sweet-
faced, ersatz school teacher who's barely through being a
student. She blushes at Quinn's wink, turns to the kids.

FAITH
Right then, loves. Time for maths.

The Kids all protest.

FAITH (CONT'D)
Come on, now. Thank the Fire Chief for
comin' to storytell.

KIDS
Not yet! One more! Please! Please!

Faith can't get a word in. She looks at Quinn, who smiles.

QUINN
All right. Just one...
KIDS
“The one about the shark"! "The Indiana

man"! "The Lion Thingy"!
BETH, a shy girl of eight, speaks from the back.

BETH
Tell us about The Ashley.

Everyone goes quiet at the mention of that name. Long pause.

(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:

QUINN
You've heard that one plenty, Beth.

BETH
Not the way you tell it.

The children stare at him. Quinn glances at Faith, who nods.

Quinn gestures the kids in; they gather around him in a tight
circle, as if it were a campfire tale.

QUINN
Listen then. You've heard how they found
The Ashley in London town. Asleep in her
cave, she was, in water colder 'n' ice.
So long in darkness, her skin was clear
as glass.

JARED
How long she been there?

QUINN
Thousands of years, Jared. Since the
last ice age, even.

BETH
Was it magic she lived so long?

QUINN
No, Beth. Some reptiles, they hibernate
in the cold. Scientists reckon she slept
without eatin'. Without breathin. Waitin
for warmth to wake her. And it did...

With his hands he casts SHADOW OF A WINGED SHAPE on the wall.
QUINN (CONT'D)
She rose into the sky that night, her
skin turnin' the color of evening. Then
like a ghost in the wind she disappeared.
The hands' shadow vanishes.
EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY
A lone WATCHMAN stands atop the castle tower.
QUINN (VO)
Oh, men looked for her, surely. Searched
with machines from ocean to air.

He scans the sky with an old coin-operated TOURIST BINOCULARS.
He puts coin slug after coin slug into it to keep it going.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:

QUINN (VO)

(CONT'D)
But The Ashley was smart. She'd flown far
into the Arab deserts...

EXT. PLAIN - NEAR CASTLE

A SENTRY squats in a stone hutch, watching the sky with a
telescope.

QUINN (VO)
.+.-and buried herself deep in the sands
where nobody'd find her.

Unseen by the man, something MOVES in the sky behind him.
TWO AIRBORNE SHAPES

huge yet nearly invisible. They BLEND IN with the smoky sky, like
chameleons turned the color of clouds.

INT. CLASS ROOM

QUINN
A year later, that whole desert starts
shiftin' an' shakin’, as if the sands
"emselves were alive. And then...

Quinn's HAND SHADOWS imitate the ground exploding.
QUINN (CONT'D)
Up they came! Thousands of thousands of
them. The Ashley's brood. Takin' to the
air like locusts.

POV OF THE AIRBORNE CREATURE -- looking down through the
cloud cover at the living fields below.

QUINN (VO)
They fell first on the cities...

REVERSE ANGLE - BY CHARRED TREE
QUINN (VO)

...and then on the land.

A WIND picks up. The charred tree trembles...then
DISINTEGRATES INTO SWIRLING ASHES.

INT. CLASSROOM
The Kids look on expectantly.

BETH
And then?

EXT. GRAND COURTYARD - DAY

As the wind picks up, the animals in the Courtyard react.
Horses skitter. Dogs begin to HOWL and BARK.

INT. CLASSROOM

Quinn suddenly stiffens, sensing something.
EXT. CASTLE PARAPET - DAY

The Watchman suddenly spies something.

WATCHMAN
Oh, Christ!

He immediately turns the crank of an AIR RAID SIREN. Its ear-
piercing WHINE cuts through the air.

EXT. FARM FIELDS - BY WATER TENDER - DAY
Several Firemen atop a Tender look up just as

CRACK!! An ARC OF PHOSPHOROUS LIGHTNING STRIKES THE TENDER!
The vehicle EXPLODES in a cloud of superheated steam.

INT. CHAPEL
Quinn gathers the students.
QUINN
Jared, get ‘em to the cellars! Faith,
you're with me...
EXT. FARM FIELDS - DAY

The siren BLARES as Firemen on a second Tender desperately
try to extinguish the flames shooting up from the first...

Two other Firemen mount a decrepit WWII ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN...
Terrified Farm Workers run SCREAMING for cover as...
CRACK!! Another Phosphorous Arc strikes in the middle of the

corn field. The effect is like NAPALM -- A SWATH OF FIRE
SCYTHING through the vegetation, consuming all in its path.
18.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

The yard's in the grip of ordered panic. Like a city used to
war, PEOPLE run for pre-arranged protection of the castle
towers as above the Watchman shouts

WATCHMAN
STRIKE ON THE NORTH FIELD!! STRIKE ON
THE NORTH FIELD!!
Quinn and Faith race to the yard's end to a
INT. BARN STRUCTURE

A rag-tag FIREHOUSE stocked with equipment that ranges from
modern day oxygen tanks to old hand-operated waterpumps.

Quinn rushes to a TWO-WAY RADIO, flicks it on. CRIES and
SOUNDS of a desperate battle are heard.

QUINN
Justen? Talk to me!

JUSTEN (OS, OVER RADIO)
Be're in the middle of the gobshite, Chief!

EXT. FIELD - DAY
JUSTEN, 35, buff, firefighter, screams into a combat phone.
JUSTEN
= got three Tenders down and two worms in

the air...

His voice is drowned out by the BLAM BLAM BLAM of the Anti-
Aircraft gm as it BLASTS its shells into the sky above.

The shells EXPLODE, pocking the cloudy air with black bursts.

But the SHAZES easily avoid the blasts. Barely visible, they
slide into tie clouds like snakes slithering under stones.

INT. BARN/FIREHOUSE
QUINN
Lesten to me: dig in an' hold your
position. I'm comin' with back up.
(No response.)
Jweten?

Only a STATICHISS from the radio.

Quinn looks up. Dave Creedy, Faith and TWENTY MEN AND WOMEN
have joined him. They stare at Quinn in tense silence.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Suit up.

MONTAGE

Clipped, staccato CLOSE-UPS of Quinn and Co. suiting up.
They're like knights getting ready for battle:

A thick ALUMINIZED FIRECOAT is thrown over Quinn's
shoulders...An asbestos GAUNTLET/GLOVE is thrust over his
hand...A PULASKI (double bladed hoe and axe) slides into a
SEEATH on his back...A FIREMAN'S HELM fits over his head.
Finally, a plexiglass VISOR snaps down over his face.

EXT. OUTSIDE CASTLE - BY MAIN GATES - DAY

The metal gates are thrown open...and Quinn CHARGES OUT,
RIDING ATOP A HORSE, leading

A RAGTAG FIRE BATTALLION on a range of vehicles: horse-drawn
FIRECARTS; LIGHT PUMPERS (mini-firetrucks the size of cars);
a MACK AEPIAL (a truck witn a long extension ladder); and an
ALVIS SALAMANDER (armored 6-wheel ATV used for runway fires).
EXT. TOP OF HILL - DAY

Quinn pulls up short, looks down at the fields below.

THE AREA IS AN INFERNO! Walls of THICK BLACK SMOKE rise into
the air, backlit by orange flames.

Above, a WWII MOSQUITO FIGHTER PLANE roars by, dumping RED
FLAME RETARDANT FOAM over the fire. It does almost no good.

Quinn speaks into a MIC set into his helmet.

QUINN
Eddie, gimme the word...

INT. MOSQUITO FIGHTER PLANE - COCKPIT

EDDIE STAX -- 30s, cockney, so huge he barely fits into the
cockpit -- stares out the window.

EDDIE
We got us a firebox, Quinn.

EDDIE'S POV -- FIELDS BELOW. All four sides of the field
area are BURNING, creating a literal box. Within, PEOPLE are

running, choking, looking for an escape. Blinded by the black
smoke, they can't see a way out; they're like rats ina trap.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I count 30, maybe 40 people inside.

QUINN (0S)
Any sign a the worms?

Eddie sees a DISTANT SHAPE passing into the clouds above.

EDDIE
They're circlin'.

EXT. TOP OF HILL - DAY

QUINN
Keep ‘em off our backs. We're gonna try a
rescue.

EDDIE (OS)

You mental?! That wind shifts, you got a
firestorm. Neo one's gonna make it...

QUINN
Just do it!

Quinn turns to his "troops", now pulling up to the hill.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Listen up! All companies, we're gonna
take this bastard on the west side. I
want a 20 meter firebreak in ten minutes.
(Dismounts from his horse)
Danny, fit a 10-K searchlight to the
Mack. My signal, you turn it on.

Quinn jumps atop the Salamander which Creedy drives.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Bad news, Dave. You're with me.

CREEDY
What're we doin'?

QUINN
Walkin' in God's garden...

ABOVE ANGLE
The battallim charges down, splitting left toward the west

"wall" of the fire box. The Salamander breaks right,

INT. MOSQUITO COCKPIT

Andy, the plane's 20-year old tailgunner, nervously locks and
loads his gun as Eddie removes a MICROPHONE from his panel.
He flicks a switch marked PA SYSTEM. .

EDDIE
OY!! WANKERS!!

EXT. OUTSIDE MOSQUITO - DAY
His voice BLARES over a LOUDSPEAKER on the plane's belly.

EDDIE (OVER PA)
YEAH, YOU! YOU SLITHEY-TOVED BASTARDS!

POV - AIRBORNE CREATURES

Taking notice of the Mosquito. We hear Eddie's voice as THE
CREATURES HEAR IT: a series of HARSH, GRATING NOISES.

INT. MOSQUITO

Andy OPENS FIRE as the SHAPES start to head for the plane.
EXT. SKY - OUTSIDE MOSQUITO - DAY

The plane banks, leading the shapes away from the fields.
EXT. FIELD - WEST SIDE OF FIRE - DAY

The fire companies are attacking the firewall: spraying
water, using the pulaskis to create a firebreak.

EXT. FIELD - EAST SIDE OF FIRE - DAY

The Salamander speeds toward a WALL OF FLAME. Quinn stands
atop the vehicle, manning an artillery sized FIRE HOSE GUN.
Creedy sticks his head out the window.

CREEDY
DON'T YOU FALL OFF!

QUINN
DON'T YOU SLOW DOWN!

Creedy mumbles a prayer, then FLOORS the accelerator. The
firewall GROWS till it fills his entire line of sight.

TOP OF SALAMANDER -- Quinn sprays the fire, creating a breach
CRASH! THE SALAMANDER BURSTS THROUGH THE FIRE WALL TO

EXT. A CROP FIELD - DAY

The inside of the "firebox" is a maelstrom of BLACK-SMOFE
peppered with RED HOT CINDERS. One can't see 5 feet ahead

CREEDY
It's gonna be hell findin' anybody!

QUINN
Drive slow. They'll find us...

Quinn points the nozzle out and begins SPRAYING water ina
wide, slow arc into the smoke-choked fields.

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE FIELD - DAY

A MAN and several CHILDREN struggle in the darkness, unable
to see, barely able to breath. There seems to be no way out.

Suddenly, a SPRAY OF WATER pierces through the thick hot
smoke, sprinkling their faces like a cool benediction.

EXT. TOP OF SALAMANDER
Quinn keeps spraying as he calls into the black void.

QUINN
ANYONE THERE! KEEP LOW! FOLLOW THE WATER!

His eyes are tearing from the smoke as he scans the darkness.
For a long moment, there is nothing.

But then, through the clouds, they come. PEOPLE, coughing,
choking, drawn from the inferno by the life-giving water.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Hold on to the truck!

They cling to the truck, which leads them through the dark.
EXT. SKY - BY MOSQUITO - DAY

FLASH! A PHOSPHOROUS ARC cuts through the clouds like
horizontal lightning. The Mosquito barely avoids it.

EDDIE'S VOICE (OVER PA)

IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?! YOU SOD-
SUCKIN' EXCUSE FOR A REPTILE...?

INT. MOSQUITO COCKPIT

Andy looks out the window, shouts to him. Eddie sees that his
right engine is on fire. He switches frequencies on the mic.

; EDDIE
Quinn...I got a flame out on number two.
We gotta call it a day...

EXT. SKY BY MOSQUITO - Day
The Mosquito banks away, toward the safety of the castle.
EXT. FIELDS - BY SALAMANDER - DAY

A STRING OF PEOPLE now hold on to the Salamander for dear
life. But it's a case of the blind leading the blind.

CREEDY
I can't see a bloody thing...

QUINN
Settle down.
(To Radio)
Faith! How's my fireline?
EXT. WEST SIDE OF FIELDS - DAY

The firemen have created a 20 meter BREAK in the fire wall.
It literally looks like a door out of hell.

Faith speaks into her radio.

FAITH
Right and ready, Chief.

QUINN (OVER RADIO)
That 10K rigged?

Faith looks up to brigade lieutenant DANNY GOODWIN, age 30,
who stands atop a THIRTY FOOT LADDER that extends from the
Mack. A SEARCHLIGHT has been set upon it.

DANNY
Ready, Chief.

QUINN (OS OVER RADIO}
Light ‘em up.

Danny throws a switch. The searchlight FLICKERS ON
EXT. FIELDS - By SALAMANDER - DAY

The LIGHT PIERCES THROUGH THE SMOKE LIKE A KNIFE. A beacon
to guide the Salamander out.

Creedy LAUGHS. He drives toward the light.

But then Quinn hears a BOY shouting behind him.

BOY
Mr. Quinn! My sister...she let go...

Quinn calls to Creedy.

QUINN
Keep it movin', Dave!

Quinn jumps off the back, heads toward the fields.

EXT. SKY - DAY

POV OF AIRBORNE CREATURES -- flying back toward the fields.
EXT. BY FIREBREAK - DAY

The Firemen rush to help the survivors into every vehicle. A
gentle WHOOSH of a breeze is heard. Faith feels it first.

FAITH
(Nervously, to walkie-talkie)
Quinn...
EXT. FIELD - DAY
Quinn picks up a barely conscious GIRL lying on the ground.

FAITH (OS, OVER RADIO)
Winds changin'. The fire's gonna flare...

His radio SPUTTERS. Quinn taps it. No good. IT'S DEAD.
EXT. FIELD - BY FIREBREAK - DAY

FAITH
Quinn? Can you hear me?

No response. Unsure of whether Quinn knows of the danger,
she runs into the fields in search of her chief.

EXT. FIELD - BY QUINN -' DAY

From his belt, Quinn pulls a FIRE SHELTER -- a floorless
aluminum pup tent. He spreads it over himself and the girl.
He secures the edges with his boot tips and gloved hands.

QUINN
Glynnis...we're gonna close our eyes an'
stay flat. When I count three, you hold
your breath. Can you do that for me?

(CONTINUED)

The Girl nods, terrified. The roar of wind gets louder.

QUINN (CONT'D)
One...

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FIELD - DAY
Faith feels the wind. She pulls out her emergency shelter.

QUINN (OS)

Faith tries to assemble it, but lacks Quinn's experienced
calm. Her hands shake, costing her precious seconds.

INT. QUINN'S FIRE-SHELTER

QUINN

Quinn and the Girl breath deep.
EXT. FIELDS - VARIOUS - DAY

WHOOSH! A GUST OF WIND sends fire FLARING OVER THE FIELDS.
It washes like a tsunami over Quinn's emergency shelter...

EXT. FIELD - BY FAITH - DAY

...and STRIKES FAITH FULL ON as she tries to get into her own
shelter. So quick, she never knew what hit her.

INT. QUINN'S FIRE SHELTER

The Girl clutches Quinn as the fire FLARES over the shelter,
shaking and roaring as if it were a living thing.

EXT. FIELDS - DAY

The Salamander drives in. Danny's at the wheel, Creedy mans
the water gun, spraying the fiery ground before him. He sees
Quinn's shelter, sprays the area around it.

CREEDY
Quinn!

Quinn emerges from the shelter, the young girl in his arms.

CREEDY (CONT'D)
Move it! We got worms comin'!

(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:

QUINN
(Handing girl to Danny)
Where's Faith?

Danny shakes his head. Quinn stares a second, unbelieving.
He turns, Starts to go look for the girl. Creedy stops him.

CREEDY
FORGET IT, QUINN! SHE'S DUSTED!

Quinn struggles; but Creedy is much stronger than he looks.
He pulls Quinn back to the Salamander.

EXT. HILL OVER FIELDS - AERIAL VIEW - DAY

SHADOWS OF TWO WINGED FORMS pass over the land, flying north
towerd the burning fields.

DANNY (O.S., OVER RADIO)
Chief, they're comin' down. You want a
counterattack?
INT. SALAMANDER
Quinn looks at the blackened, exhausted faces of his Firemen.
CREEDY
They'll just go airborne again. Hit us
from the sky.
Quinn stares out the window, his eyes weary, almost lifeless.

QUINN
Pull back.

EXT. HILL OVER FIELDS ~ AERIAL VIEW - DAY

The battallion of fire vehicles beats a hasty retreat south.
EXT. FIELDS - DAY

The fire subsides. Once green fields are now nothing but ash.
Through smoke, we see SILHOUETTES OF TWO HUGE WINGED SHAPES
landing on the field. We don't get a full view of them; just
CLOSE SHOTS of PARTS OF THEIR BODIES seen through the smoke:

A CLAW/LEG -- the stunted limb of a beast not built for walking.

WINGS -- veined, leathery, batlike. Folding silently against

(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:

A GIANT TORSO -- 30-feet of slick, reptilian scales. The
scales are the color of clouds. But as they near the charred
earth, they CHANGE HUE, turning the COLOR of the dark ground.

Finally -- and perhaps worst of all -- A HUGE MOUTH enters
frame. Lips curled in the perpetual smile of a predator.
Its teeth are like rows of sword-length RAZOR SHARP NEEDLES.

A CABLE-LIKE TONGUE unwinds from its maw. It sweeps over the
charred ground and begins to rake in piles of ash.

The mouth FEEDS ON THE ASH. Its needle-teeth MESH together,
creating a kind of filter which strains bits not completely
burned: pieces of metal, wood and human bone.

As the mouth works its meal, something falls from its lips.
The remains of Faith's scorched FIRE SHELTER.

A RATTLING SOUND is heard, followed by a short BURST of
PHOSPHOROUS FLAME. The fire consumes the shining tent,
reducing the last remnant of the girl to ashes.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

Lit by solar-powered floodlights, it looks like an island
caught between dual voids of black sky and black earth.

EDDIE (OS)
Look, if my conscience could change the
math, it would...

INT. MEETING HALL

A council of Firemen -- Creedy, Danny, Eddie among them --
argue around a long rusted table. Quinn sits at the head,
examining a CHALKBOARD filled with numeric calculations.

EDDIE
But it's plain subtraction, all right?
With those fields gone, we're not gonna
have enough food for winter.

DANNY
It's only August. We can still lay ina
new crop...

EDDIE

With those worms out there?

CREEDY
They'll leave once they've fed.

(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:

EDDIE
That could be months.

CREEDY
You the bloody Almanac now?

EDDIE
No, Creedy, I just got bloody eyes...

QUINN
(Calmly)
All right, cut it down.

The group shuts up. They stare at Quinn, who scratches
recalculations on the board with a piece of chalk.

QUINN (CONT'D)

Now we still got the hydroponics. I can
convert the main hall into a greenhouse.
If we cut to half-rations...trade for
seed with Edinburgh...

Looks up at them.)
It won't be a feast, lads, but it'll get
folks through to March.

EDDIE
That's it, then? The grand solution?

Quinn looks at him. Eddie shakes his head bitterly.

CREEDY
You got a problem with it?

EDDIE
Nooo. I think it's rosey-fuckin'-doo.
(To the others.)
We burrow like rats. Starve through
another winter...

DANNY
Eddie...

EDDIE
...meanwhile, Ashley squats in London,
hatching her eggs. Come spring, her kids
can just burn us out again...

QUINN
All right.

EDDIE

It's not all right, Chief! HOW LONG WE
GOTTA PUT UP WITH THIS?!

(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:

Quinn sees the same question reflected in each of his
firemen's eyes. When Eddie speaks again, it's a challenge.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I'm for goin' to London.

Quinn shakes his head. Eddie turns to the others.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
Look, there's buildings still standin'
there. Food. Medicine. If we knock out
Ashley's nest, it's all ours...

CREEDY
We can't even handle the two worms here.
You wanna pick a fight with their ma?!

EDDIE
I'd rather go out fightin' than starvin'.

QUINN
An' take the whole castle with you?
{Shakes his head.)
We stick to the strategy.

EDDIE
(Icily)
Same strategy that got Faith killed?

The room goes dead quiet; Eddie's clearly crossed a line.

EDDIE (CONT'D)
I say we put it to a vote.
(To Quinn)
Or you too much of a big girl's blouse?

Quinn remains composed. He rises, chalkboard in hand.

QUINN
All right. I can see there's a bit of
division on the subject.
(Starts walking around table)
But let's not start callin' names, yeah?
Least we owe each other is the courtesy
of debating this like Englishmen...

Quinn wheels round and BREAKS THE CHALKBOARD ON EDDIE'S HEAD.

The firemen are taken aback. Quinn stands over Eddie.

(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:

QUINN (CONT'D)
Your first job's to this community. Not your
damn pride. You wanna play buckaroo, join
another brigade.

Quinn tosses the broken chalkboard down to him, then leaves.
INT. QUINN'S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Quinn feeds his fish with GRUBS from a jar of earth.

A KNOCK on the door. Creedy enters, carrying a plate filled
with a scary looking potato. Quinn regards it dubiously.

QUINN
What's this then?

CREEDY
Fookin' spud.
(Sets it down)
I simmered it in gravy; gave it a nice
bouquet. Earthy. Kin' a mooshroomy...

QUINN
Almost fungus-y.

CREEDY
Just eat it.

Quinn smiles, takes the plate.
Creedy sits on the bed; he's visibly on edge.

QUINN
You been havin' conversations.

Creedy tries to put it delicately.

CREEDY
There's some thinkin'...maybe Eddie's
right.

Quinn shakes his head.

CREEDY (CONT'D)
Quinn, he's got a big mouth, but he's
also got a point. We can't last here
forever. Sooner or later, we gotta make a
stand...

QUINN
We are makin' a stand.

(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:

Quinn goes to the window, gestures out.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Look at it. Twenty years ago, you
couldn't see the sky, there was so many
of 'em. Ten years, you couldn't lay ina
crop. Now we can. What's that tell you?

Creedy rubs his eyes. They've been through this before.

QUINN (CONT'D)
We can outlast ‘em, Dave. Every year,
there's less to burn, less ash for 'em to
eat. They'll starve eventually. We just
gotta hang on till...

CREEDY
Till when? You don't know.

QUINN
I know Ashley. We go stirrin' her up,
we'll be diggin’ graves for every man,
woman an' child around.
(Shakes his head.)
I'm not partial to doin' that duty again.

Creedy glances at a faded 20th-century POSTCARD on the wall:
a PHOTO OFA CASTLE with inscription: PEMBREY CASTLE.

CREEDY
That was eight years ago, mate. You
can't keep blamin' yourself...
Quinn suddenly stops, seeing something through the window:
BRIGHT LIGTS playing in the distance, slowly approaching.
SHOUTS are Zeard in the hall outside. Danny runs in.
DANNY
Wehicles comin'!
(Nervously, to Quinn.)
%E looks like a raiding party.
Quinn and Geedy exchang= glances, then head for the door.
EXT. CASTLEBATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

Alive with mmmotion. Quinn's Firemen run along the
battlements, taking positions with guns, crossbows, etc.

Armed with arold rifle, Quinn climbs up to the battlements.

WHITE LIGHTS dart wildly in the darkness over the ridge,

EXT. NEARBY RIDGE - NIGHT
CLOSE SHOTS of WHEELS and TREADS of some seriously HEAVY
VEHICLES. Chewing up and spitting out chunks of blackened
ground as they grind toward the castle.
EXT. BATTLEMENTS
Quinn paces the battlements, commanding like a general.
QUINN
Danny, take B company to the south wall.
Eddie! Get that goddam howitzer up here!
The ENGINE ROAR gets louder; the white lights closer.
EXT. WATCHTOWER - NIGHT
The Watchman squints into his Tourist Binoculars.
HIS POV

a LICENSE PLATE attached to a yet unseen vehicle. It reads:
NEW HAMPSHIRE. "LIVE FREE OR DIE".

PULL BACK TO REVEAL it is attached to
AN ABRAMS TANK. 46 tons. God's wrath in metal.
EXT. BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

As they pull a Howitzer into position on the wall, Quinn and
Creedy get a glimpse of what's coming.

CREEDY
Say goodnight to the folks, Gracie...

EXT. RIDGE - NIGHT

EIGHT HEAVILY ARMORED VEHICLES follow the Abrams: BRADLEY
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS bristling with guns; AML MINI-
TANKS outfitted with HARPOON LAUNCHERS; and finally, a scud-
like MOWAG MISSILE CARRIER.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

Firemen look at each other nervously. They're utterly
outgunned. Quinn tries to keep them from panicking.

QUINN
Easy, lads. We still got height on 'em.

THE VERICLES' ROAR becomes deafening. In the blinding glare
of their headlights, they look like a herd of metal monsters.

Quinn takes a position at the wall.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Fire by file on my signal!

THE VEHICLES keep coming. A WHIRRRR from the APCs. ARTILLERY
GUNS SPROUT from wells at their top, aiming at

CREEDY, who nervously mans the Howitzer. It's like facing
down a bazooka with a water pistol.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Steady!!

THE ABRAMS TANK turns its massive turret gun toward
THE FIREMEN, holding position, keeping one eye on
QUINN, who raises his arm, waiting till the enemy's in range.

QUINN (CONT'D)
Steady!!

His arm is about to come down when suddenly
THE VEHICLES STOP. That quickly. All noise fades into echoes.
QUINN doesn't move. A long, eerie silence follows, broken by

THE ABRAMS TANK. A metallic CH¥-CHK-CHK is heard from its
top-hatch. The hatch opens up with a heavy CLUNK!

A scarred LEFT HAND appears, holding a PDW SUBMACHINE GUN.
An equally scarred RIGHT HAND appears, holding a CIGAR.
The two arms work together to pull up their massive owner
DENTON VAN ZAN

30s, handsome, an American Achilles. The classical features
of a Roman general; the 1000-yard stare of a Vietnam vet.

He surveys the landscape impassively, lights the cigar with a
Zippo, takes a drag, then passes judgment.

VAN 2AN (OS)
You by the Howitzer!

Creedy turns, sees Van Zan is talking to him.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
Yeah, you, Sparky. Who's in charge?

CREEDY
What he call me?

QUINN
Shhh...

CREEDY

I AIN' NO FOOKIN' "SPARKY"!!

Shut your gob!

Quinn pulls Creedy back. Beat. He yells back at Van Zan.

QUINN (CONT'D)
What's your business?

Van Zan smiles.

VAN ZAN
Real estate.

QUINN

Yeah, well, the market's a bit depressed
right now. I advise lookin' elsewhere.

VAN ZAN
Relax, bro. We're here to make friends.

Van Zan lays down his gun, jumps to the ground, raises his
empty hands in a sign of "truce".

Long beat. Quinn considers, then calls out to him.

QUINN
Keep your vehicles back. I'll meet you at
the gate.

Van Zan begins walking toward the castle.
Quinn gives Creedy his rifle.

QUINN (CONT'D)
He tries anything, you know what to do.

It's plain from Creedy’s face he hasn't any idea.
EXT. COURTYARD - BY GATE - NIGHT

Quinn nods to a Firemen. The man opens the gate, revealing
Van Zan, standing casually on the other side. The two men
look at each other a moment, sizing one another up.

VAN ZAN
I'm told in Medieval days, two Kings'd
meet, they'd exchange the kiss of peace.
(Extends his hand.)
I'll settle for a handshake.

QUINN
Back then, they shook hands to see if
there were weapons up their sleeves.

Quinn takes Van Zan's hand. Not as much a greeting as a
method of immobilization. For a moment, neither man lets go.

QUINN (CONT'D)
What's your game, mate? You tradin'’ or
attackin'?

VAN ZAN
That depends on you, "Mr. Buddy".

QUINN
I ain't your "buddy".

VAN 2ZAN
And I ain't your "mate". But that doesn't
mean we can't come to an agreement.
(Gestures back to his vehicles.)
My boys are kinda tired. Long trip, bad
food. We were hopin' for accommodations.

QUINN
What's it worth to you?

CONTINUED:

Van Zan removes a PACK from his shoulder, hands it to Quinn.
It's filled with army issue C-RATIONS.

VAN 2AN
100 pounds of C-rations. Plus freeze-
dried ice-cream for the kids.
Quinn considers a moment, then tosses the bag back at him.

QUINN
I think you can do better.

Van Zan remains pleasant, but shows a flash of teeth as he
tosses the bag back at him.

VAN ZAN
You know...you're really not ina
position to negotiate.
Van Zan nods in the direction of his mini armada.

Quinn takes it in stride, throws the bag back at him.

QUINN
I reckon I'm doin' all right.

Quinn nods up to his armed men lining the battlements.

Van Zan smiles, knowing they're even. He holds out the bag,
this time a little more congenially.

VAN ZAN
Okay, friend. 150 pounds.

QUINN
200. And that's just for one night.

VAN ZAN
Done.

Quinn goes to take the bag. Van Zan grabs his hand.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
But you don't get any ice cream.

Quinn allows himself a smile. He takes the bag.
EXT. OVER CASTLE - AERIAL VIEW - A LITTLE LATER - NIGHT

Van Zan's armada enters through the gates into

EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

Residents line up to gawk at the new arrivals. Quinn and his
Firemen watch, their weapons at the ready.

DANNY

QUINN
That's what he calls himself.

CREEDY
Sounds like a blood disease. They ship
all that shite over?

QUINN
Transport plane. Crash-landed off the coast.

EDDIE
What the hell are they doing here?

Quinn is silent. He just stares at
THE COURTYARD

Van Zan sits atop the moving tank, waving to the people with
all of the confidence of Patton entering Palermo.

VAN ZAN
Evenin'...nice to be here...thanks for
watching...
SEVERAL KIDS touch his tank in fascination.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
"Scuse me.

The kids look up. Van Zan stares down at them coldly.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
Do I play with your tank?

Beat. The kids all shake their heads.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
Then don't mess with mine. Scram.

And they do.

He netices a shrimpy 16-year old KID unloading his gear from
a truck. The boy has NO LEGS. Just tied off stumps at his
hips. None of his comrades make any attempt to help him.
Moved by the sight, Creedy walks over to him.

CREEDY
Need a hand there, lad?

The Kid draws a huge SHOTGUN from a sheath on his back.

KID
Suck my dick.

Creedy goes crimson.

A deep LAUGH is heard behind him. Creedy turns to see GIDEON
-- black, 30s, seven-feet of post-apocalyptic rasta man.

GIDEON
He fine by himself, mon. Da Pope don't
like charity.
Creedy looks back at the kid, who shall now be known as

CREEDY
"The Pope"?

Before Creedy can say more, the SOUND OF ROTORS is heard.
EXT. CENTER OF COURTYARD - NIGHT
A WASH OF WIND AND LIGHT comes over the crowd.
VAN ZAN
Ladies and gentlemen, you all might want
to move back a bit...

The crowd rushes to get out of the way of

A Blackhawk "" HELICOPTER, descending from the heavens. It
nestles down into the middle of the Courtyard.

QUINN
Aw, spiffy...

But his attitude changes when the pilot appears at the door

COLLEEN BEANE -- 20s, small build, enigmatic eyes. Her
perpetual dress is a unisex flight-suit and combat boots.

VAN ZAN
What took you, Beane?

(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:

COLLEEN
(Laughs)
What took me? Your coordinates, my man.
They almost took me to France.
(Puts her arm on his shoulder)
Not that I couldn't use the vacation...

The two walk off. Quinn finds himself staring at her. Not
because it's a female pilot; rather, because it's one of
those times when he can't help himself.

EXT. COURTYARD - LATER - NIGHT

Creedy walks with Van Zan, who carries The Pope back-to-back
via a harness. Pope hangs from the man like a weird knapsack.

CREEDY
I take it you watch his back.

THE POPE
No, Sparky. He watches mine.

PAN OVER TO Colleen and Quinn, walking behind them. Colleen
looks around the area, inspecting the castle walls.

COLLEEN
I've never seen a base like this. It
pretty secure?

QUINN
We moved into here after the other
buildings were destroyed. The Normans
built their castles to last.

COLLEEN
Normans?

QUINN
Norman dynasty. Y'know, Richard the
Lionheart.

COLLEEN
He your Fire Chief?

COLLEEN

They take each other's hand.

Bunking down in the straw, The Pope unlatches his guitar
case. Colleen checks out one of the horses, patting its neck.

Quinn watches her from the door as Creedy talks with Van Zan.
CREEDY
»+-Clean up afterwards. An' no funny
stuff with the livestock.

VAN ZAN
We'll try to contain ourselves.

Creedy goes to the door. Quinn turns to Colleen.

QUINN
Sleep well.

Van Zan claps a friendly/warning hand on Quinn's shoulder.

VAN 2AN
We'll sleep light.

Quinn smiles thinly.

QUINN
By a stunning coincidence, so will we...

Weapons armed, Quinn and the firemen stand post on the battle-

VAN ZAN

lantern light.

Quinn slumped asleep by the battlement, rifle in his hand.
Creedy nudges him.

CREEDY

your presence in the Courtyard.

QUINN

Quinn looks down. At the end of the courtyard, Van Zan sits,
surrounded by Quinn's firemen. They've put down there
weapons and listen intently to him, like kids at a camp fire.

QUINN (cont'd)
Bloody shaggin' hell...

CREEDY
You might wanna talk to him, Quinn.

He says he's a dragonslayer.

QUINN (OS)
Oy! Beowulf!

Quinn approaches him. Beat. The two eye each other.

QUINN (CONT'D)
I'm told you're a scrapper.

Beat. Van Zan removes a pair of MIRROR LENSE SUNGLASSES from
his pocket, puts them on as if he was a celebrity.

VAN ZAN
My associates and I have been known to
“scrap” things from time to time...
INT. MEETING HALL - LATER
Quinn and the inner circle of firemen sit at the council

table. Facing them are Van Zan and The Pope, both wearing
sunglasses and looking very much the cool customers.

CONTINUED:

QUINN
A hundred and fifty?!

THE POPE
One fifty three to be exact.

CREEDY
Keep a score-card, do ya?

THE POPE
(Deadpan)
We have a newsletter.

QUINN
Wait a sec, Rambo: last I knew, it took
eight fighter jets just to kill one...

VAN Z2AN
Sure. In the old days.
(Rises, begins to pace.)
First we used fighters. Then nerve gas.
Then nukes. Hell, we lost more people to
collateral damage than we ever did to the
snakes. It's no miracle they overran us.

He's come to the head of the table. He stares at Quinn.

VAN 2AN (CONT'D)
But they can be killed, folks. Cleanly.
Easily. No stress, no mess. Just takes a
little bit a "this"...
(Taps his head.
And a little bit a "this".
(Holds out his “fuck you" finger.)

Silence. The firemen look to their leader for a response.
Quinn stands up, stares at Van Zan a long moment.

QUINN
How much a "this"...

(Holds up his own "fuck you" finger)
...to get rid a the two we got here?

Van Zan looks at Quinn's finger challengingly.

VAN ZAN
How much you got?

Beat. Quinn nods at his council. One by one, each of his men
raises their middle finger. A forest of fuck yous sprouts up.

Van Zan smiles. He likes that. He likes it a lot.

INT. FIREHOUSE

VAN ZAN (0S)
First off, you have to know your enemy.

REVEAL Van Zan addressing an assembly of ALL OF QUINN'S
FIREMEN. He talks with the energy of a powerbroker.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
Worms, snakes, dragons. You deal with ‘em
every day; but what do you know about ‘em?
He picks out one tow-headed young ROOKIE FIREMAN

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
You: Jughead.

The Rookie nervously stands, as if he was in class.

ROOKIE
Well, they...they're a kind a dinosaur...

VAN ZAN
Pre-dinosaur, Einstein. Cambrian
species. Crawled out of a much scarier
swamp than you ever did.
(To the others.)
Anyone tell me why they eat ash?

All are silent. Finally it's Quinn who speaks up.

QUINN
They can only digest pure carbon.

Van Zan raises his eyebrow, mock-impressed.

VAN 2AN
So how come we never found any fossils?

QUINN
They burnt each other for food. You're
not tellin' me anything new, mate.
Van Zan smiles a challenging smile.

VAN ZAN
I'm tellin' you the big picture...

INT. CHAPEL
THUNK! A GIANT DRAGON-HIDE SCROLL is unrolled down the aisle.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

VAN ZAN (0.S.)
They're like locusts.

On it has been painted A SERIES OF PICTURES, like the Bayeux
tapestry, showing the life cycle of dragons.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
Every 50,000 years, they come up, breed
and burn, eat and starve.

Van 2an walks down the aisle, talking to the castle RESIDENTS
who are crammed into the hall trying to get a look.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
They didn't just kill the dinosaurs,
folks. They're responsible for every
Major die-off on this planet. Ash they
threw in the air caused nuclear winters
that started the freakin' ice-ages.

PAN OVER the standing room crowd. Quinn watches at back.
VAN ZAN (CONT'D)

Oh, a few of 'em survived between cycles.
Probably gave rise to the legends.

QUINN
So you don't put stock in the myths then?
VAN ZAN
What, that they're the "scourge of God"?
(Laughs. )

No. We make the myths.
He looks at a stained glass depiction of the CREATION OF MAN.
VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
As for the "Scourge of God" -- you're
talking to him.
INT. QUINN'S ROOM
Just Van Zan and Quinn now, sharing a bottle of Glenfiddich.

QUINN
So now you wanna "scourge" for us?

VAN ZAN
Mr. Buddy, I can have you sowin' crops by
Monday and eatin' pretty all winter.

QUINN
Just what do you get out of it?

(CONTINUED)

Ven Zan looks out the window.

VAN 2AN

I've seen a 1000 communities like yours,
Quinn. Scared. Starving. Fighting a war
of attrition till the snakes go away.

(Turns to him.)
Well, they won't. Not till we've
pulverized, excised and atomized them off
our God-given planet.

Van Zan walks to the table, an odd light in his eyes.

VAN ZAN (CONT'D)
See, what people don't realize is...this
ain't no disco.
(Smiles .)
It's a motherFUCKIN' HOLY WAR!

BAM! He BANGS the table so hard it nearly cracks.

QUINN
So that's it, eh? You want recruits.

VAN ZAN
You got a problem with that?

QUINN
What I got is 300 people lookin' for
protection. You want to help ‘em, fine.
But I'll not have 'em be fodder for a
personal fuckin' Jihad...

VAN ZAN
Come off it, Chief. We all got scores to
settle with 'em.

QUINN
I've learned to live with it.

VAN ZAN
No offense, but I think you've learned to
take it up your Limey butt.

Beat. Van Zan's crossed that line. Quinn rises, comes face-to~
face with him, deadly polite.

QUINN
It's a “British butt". An' I'm not in
the habit of takin' anything there.
Includin' your General Patton attitude.

VAN ZAN
If it wasn't for Patton, you people'd be

QUINN
If it wasn't for my people, you wouldn't

Tense moment...which is broken by Van Zan's easy grin.
VAN ZAN
Least we can understand each other.
(Offers his hand)
Do this one job together. If you like the
collaboration...we'll talk about others.

Quinn stares into Van Zan's eyes. Is he making a deal with a
savior? Or a devil? A moment of decision.

Quinn spits into his own palm. Van Zan smiles, does likewise.
Their hands come together with a SLAP!
SMASH CUT TO:

Van Zan's militia gears up.

MAN-SIZE HARPOONS are fit in LAUNCHERS on the AML MINITANKS.

Van Zan smiles evilly. As if to say: "you'll see".

EXT. OUTSIDE CASTLE - DAY

Van Zan's militia moves out, flanked by Quinn's firemen.

FLAGS fly from each vehicle: the original U.S. flag of 1775 --
A PICTURE OF A SNAKE with the logo: DON'T TREAD ON ME.

END MONTAGE. DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PLAIN - DAY

Vehicles are strategically placed on what looks like a barren

order comes. Last thing I need is one a

Where you gonna be?

COLLEEN (0.S.)
Denton wants him in the chopper.

Quinn turns to see Colleen approaching.

QUINN
I don't take orders from your boss, lass.

COLLEEN
That's okay. You can take ‘em from me.

FIREMEN
Ooococoh. .

Quinn blushes despite himself. Colleen smiles.

COLLEEN
You want to see how this works, right?

Beat. Quinn looks up toward Van Zan, who stands on a hill
nearby. The American speaks into a headset.

VAN ZAN
All units, this is Good Shepherd. Let's
get ready for the revival...

EXT. AROUND THE PERIMETER - DAY

Van Zan's men throw DARK COLORED NETTING over their vehicles,
camouflaging themselves in the black blasted landscape.

INT. BLACKHAWK
Gideon and TWO MEN secure their "harnesses" in the hold.

Quinn belts up in the copilot seat, Colleen next to him. He
casts a glance at her. She notices.

COLLEEN
What?

QUINN
I was just thinkin'. I've only seen you
in that jumpsuit. I was wonderin' if
you'd like some other clothes.

COLLEEN
Your straps're on wrong.

She moves to help him.

COLLEEN (CONT'D) *
You ever been up in one of these?

QUINN
Bh. No. I've just flown planes.

COLLEEN
Well, this is a lot different.
(Fastens his buckle.)
Whatever you do, don't touch anything.

QUINN ;
You're makin' that a tad difficult.

He smiles. She blushes despite herself, clips his belt.

EXT. BY SOUND VEHICLE - DAY

Van Zan goes to the driver's seat. There sits GOOSH -- stringy hair,
hippy-like demeanor, zapped out eyes. Imagine Dennis Hopper from
APOCALYPSE NOW as a disc jockey.

Ladies and gentleman, are we ready to

The Blackhawk leaps into the air like a dog off its chain.
The music rises with it. A clarion call to battle...

SERIES OF DISSOLVES:

Through a cloud-choked sky, moving far, far away. The music
becomes faint...fainter...until it's a whisper in the wind.

But then, just as it's about to become inaudible

GIDEON
You wanna dance wid da Devil, you gotta

He opens the cargo door. Then, with the grace of a cliff
diver, he LEAPS OUT.

EXT. SKY OUTSIDE BLACKHAWK - DAY

Gideon falls, his two pals right behind him. Bodies rigid,
they hurtle zoward the ground like knives.

Gideon mouths a countdown, then grabs the two METAL RODS that
run along his chest. What follows is instantaneous:

He flips out his hands and the metal rods...

His legs do a SCISSOR KICK; the leg braces lock with a SNAP!

away from the monster.

INT. INSIDE BLACKHAWK COCKPIT

Quinn looks out his side window to see

EXT. THE DRAGON - DAY

Giving chase, the way a wolf would run down a rabbit.

Nah.

Quinn looks out the window.

COLLEEN
Trust me. We're being watched over.

THE HANGLIDING "ANGELS" ARE BATTLING THE DRAGON MID-AIR!
It's an awesome sight. Their long rifles look like ANGEL

sparrows trying to bring down an eagle.

The Dragon twists, trying to get a fix on the annoying gnats.
It sees Archangel #1, lets out a phosphorous stream.
Archangel #1 easily banks away...

...and Archangel #2 closes in. He raises his rifle, FIRES...

His sonic grenade SLAMS into the Dragon's face like a burr.
The Dragon begins to thrash in pain.

ARCHANGEL #2

The sonic grenade SLAMS into the exposed stretched TYMPANUM
of the Dragon's ear. It GOES OFF IN A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE.

DRAGON'S POV

We hear it as the beast hears it: AN UNENDURABLE BLAST OF
SOUND.

The Dragon shakes its head to disengage the grenade. But the
metal is deeply embedded in its ear, and its legs are too
short to get to it. There's no way to dislodge it in the air.
So the beast does the only thing it can; it descends.

It drags its head over the ground, scraping the sonic grenade

The First Mini-tank FIRES ITS HARPOON! The projectile knifes
through the air, connected to the tank by a WIRE ON A WINCH.

A HAIL OF GUNFIRE. The Firemen let loose with everything
they've got, keeping the dragon away from the boulders.

The Dragon's tongue whips out, SKEWERING A FIREMAN RIGHT
THROUGH THE TORSO.

Its head STRIKES FORWARD LIKE A SNAKE, GRABBING A FOOTSOLDIER
AND TEARING HIM TO PIECES IN ITS SWORD-LENGTH TEETH.

But another Soldier unleashes a barrage of EXPLOSIVE-TIPPED
BULLETS AT THE DRAGON'S FACE, SEVERING ITS TONGUE.

The creature is now utterly defenseless. It's payback time.

VAN ZAN (OS)
All units...stand by for communion.

The footsoldiers begin to pull back; the firemen follow them.

Van Zan walks over, bearing The Pope on his back, backpack
style. He walks with the measured steps of an executioner.

DANNY
(To Creedy)
"Step three"?

Van Zan stops a ways from the Dragon. He glares at it like a
general meeting a vanquished, unrepentant foe. The Dragon
HISSES and SPITS. It's difficult to know who hates who more.

VAN ZAN
(To The Pope)
Bless him.

In a weird Janus moment, Van Zan turns his back on the
Dragon, thus turning The Pope toward it. The Pope raises his
RPG, rests it on his and Van Zan's shoulders.

Chaos for a moment. Then, slowly, the debris settles.
CREEDY AND THE FIREMEN

Van Zan lights his cigar from a burning piece of debris, then
strikes a somber pose of victory over the incinerated corpse.

A CLICK-FLASH from a camera is heard-seen. FIND a Soldier

SOLDIER
Okay. Now a profile...

Van Zan shifts his pose. CLICK-FLASH.

As for the Firemen, there's only a stunned silence. Finally

Quinn swings to the right...

INT. BLACKHAWE.

Colleen barely manages to hold onto the controls as

EXT. BY QUINN - DAY

Quinn holds on for dear life while the cable CUTS THROUGH the
dragon's bone and into the membrane of the wing.

QUINN
Oh, this was a bloody bad idea...

Quinn is PULLED THROUGH THE MEMBRANE OF THE WING!

CRIES OUT IN RAGE! It begins to plummet, its torn wing

EXT. THE SECOND DRAGON

hurtles helplessly downward begins its own form of defense.
It executes a bizarre aerial manoeuver. It STRAIGHTENS its
body out vertically like an arrow, then begins to SPIN,
wrapping its head and body protectively its good wing.

The result is a finely honed spear, plummeting to earth.
VAN ZAN

knows exactly what it's doing.

VAN ZAN

THE SECOND DRAGON

STRIKES into the earth head first! The creature BURROWS INTO

The copter moves to a flat pitch, allowing some lift to the

QUINN
Right...

He starts climbing as the copter descends hellishly fast.
EXT. PLAIN - DAY
Everybody's dead quiet. Van Zan whispers to The Pope.

VAN ZAN
Get ready. It could surface anywhere.

The Pope nods, starts to reload the RPG. Van Zan looks up.

THE GROUND SUDDENLY EXPLODES BEHIND HIM!

He and The Pope are thrown forward in A SPRAY OF BLACK EARTH.
Van Zan hits the ground on his front face first stunning him.
CLOSE ON - THE POPE

on his back, attached to Van Zan's back by his harness. His
RPG is just a few feet away. He reaches for it, but is
restrained by the harness.

Just then hears a RATTLING right behind him. He turns to see
THE SECOND DRAGON'S HEAD RIGHT ABOVE HIM

THE POPE
Oh, cr...

SMASH! The Dragon SINKS ITS RAZOR SHARP TEETH into his torso.

The Pope SCREAMS as the creature lifts both him and Van Zan --
still attached to the boy by the harness -- into the air.

Van Zan comes to as the creature shakes its head violently.
The Dragon's teeth have fortunately not penetrated him.

He pulls a BUCKLE on the harness, releasing him. He is
thrown to the side...tucks and rolls as he hits the ground.

EXT. PLAIN - BY BLACKHAWK

CRASH! The Blackhawk SLAMS into the earth nearby. Its
landing skits CRUMPLE with the impact.

Quinn is thrown off, landing right next to the RPG. Working
on pure figtter's instinct, he grabs it, whirls around...

...and finds himself in a wild Mexican standoff.

He's got the RPG aimed at the dragon, who still has The Pope
in its maw. The boy's alive. Blood trickles from his lips.

Van Zan rises from the ground, sees the situation.

VAN ZAN
Shoot it!

Quinn puts his finger on the trigger...and hesitates.

VAN 2AN
What are you waiting for? SHOOT!!

QUINN

Van Zan's eye flits from the Dragon to The Pope. The boy
looks at him, coughing blood but still defiant.

He nods at Van Zan. And we go into
SLOW MOTION

Van Zan suddenly makes a run at the dragon. From his chest,
he pulls a GRENADE.

Quinn yells, tries to stop him.

Van Zan gets near the beast, DIVES aside, tosses the grenade to
THE POPE

who catches it in his free hand, rips the pin with his teeth.

THE POPE
Bite me.

The Pope SLAMS GRENADE AGAINST HIMSELF IN THE DRAGON'S MOUTH.

We don't see the explosion that engulfs both the Dragon and
the boy; only Quinn's horrified reaction.

INT. MEETING HALL

Danny pulls pints from old beer kegs, serves them to the
firemen and Van Zan's militia. Creedy grabs some glasses,
carries them to Van Zan, who sits at the "table of honor".

Gideon stands atop the council table, reciting the day's
exploits like a medieval bard. Eddie accompanies him on a
bodahrun (irish drum).

GIDEON

De Beowulf of da Bronx!

(Louder cheers.)
DE VAN ZAN MAN!!!

The crowd erupts with the HUGEST CHEERS yet. Van Zan smiles
broadly, not feigning the faintest attempt at modesty.

Colleen takes a seat next to Quinn, who is unusually quiet.
She nudges him.

COLLEEN
You okay?

Quinn half-smiles, looks back warily at Van Zan,

Cries of SPEECH! SPEECH! from the crowd. Van Zan rises
modestly, puts up his arms for quiet. The crowd hushes.

VAN ZAN
I've been to many places. Liberated many

From one of his soldiers, he takes a folded CLOTH.

VAN Z2AN
..-and it is a personal privilege to
Claim your island...as the 51st state of
the United States of America!

He unfolds the cloth: it's a U.S. FLAG.
The Englishmen react to the joke with good~natured...

ENGLISHMEN
Boo! Bollocks! Yer arse!

The Americans strike up a chorus of...

VAN Z2AN'S MEN
“My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of
liberty, of thee I sing..."

Not to be outdone, Quinn and his men start a chorus of

QUINN/ENGLISHMEN
"God save our sovr'gn Queen, God save our
gracious Queen, God save our queen..."

Both songs have the same tune.

VAN ZAN'S MEN
"Land of the pilgrims' pride
Land where our fathers died..."
"Prom e-e-every mountainside..."

And soon, whether the lyrics match or not, all are singing
the same song.

ALL
"Let freedom ring!"

The moment is unexpectantly moving for all present. As the
song ends, the group erupts in CHEERS and APPLAUSE.

Quinn smiles grimly.

The Mosquito skims over the hilly landscape.
INT. MOSQUITO COCKPIT

Quinn flies. Van Zan sits in the gunner's seat, staring at A
FADED POSTCARD seen earlier on Quinn's wall: the PHOTO OF A
CASTLE with inscription: PEMBREY CASTLE.

QUINN
Man who trained me was Fire Chief here.
Pretty much how it looked back then.

VAN ZAN
So?

Quinn just gestures to the window. Van 2an looks out as the
plane rises above a ridge.

Veteran though he is, even Van Zan isn’t prepared for the
sight that now spills across the horizon...

THE RUINS OF PEMBREY CASTLE

It's not just been destroyed; it's been erased. As if God had
torn it apart stone by stone, then melted it to the ground.

EXT. CASTLE RUINS - DAY

A dance floor of death. Weapons lie melted on rock next to
HIROSHIMA SILHOUETTES of people incinerated where they
fought. Charred clothes, cracked utensils, melted toys lie
strewn over the site like surreal decorations.

Men went to London. Never come back. But
Ashley always did...

Quinn kneels, picks at something on the ground.

QUINN
She'd follow their trails home. Then burn
every man, woman an’ child to the ground.

We see what Quinn has been picking at: CHILDREN'S CRAYONS,
meited over the ground. The color is almost pretty against
the scorched background.

QUINN
But my old Chief, he was gonna be
different. He comes to my castle, tells
me how he's gonna do the old girl. Asks
for my help.

VAN 2AN
You give it to him?

CLOSE ON a large CROSS, crudely fashioned with old rusted
metal pipes. It's been set in the ground as a gravemarker.

QUINN (OS)
Dug these, didn't I?

REVEAL IT IS ONE IN A VAST FIELD OF GRAVEMARKERS. Hundreds
of similar crosses stretching to the horizon. Wind blows
through the pipe-crucifixes, making hollow, almost musical
sounds. Like ghosts, whispering to each other.

out of him 'fore he left my gate...

VAN 2FN
So what's your point?

What she is is their weakness.

QUINN

VAN 2AN (cont'd)
All the intel says she's killed every
other dragon female. She's the only egg-

out, no more babies. No more babies, no
more dragons. No more war.

QUINN
Bollocks. You've not even seen her eggs.

VAN ZAN

No. Cause you didn't have the guts to

Beat. Quinn comes close to him, deadly calm.

QUINN
You callin' me coward, mate?

VAN ZAN

Save one a yours.

VAN ZAN
Yes I would! They're the master fuckin'
race, Fireman. They've wiped out every
dominant species on this planet and we're
next. The only way we're going to live is
if we're bloody and ruthless as them!

QUINN
I'd rather die before I became like them.

She starts to unzip her flightsuit.

QUINN
Well, I didn't quite mean now...

Quinn stops. She's unzipped the suit so that just the top of
her chest is exposed. It is a mass of SCAR TISSUE.

Colleen's face has remained impassive.

COLLEEN
Snakes flamed my house when I was 8. My
nightdress caught fire. Van Zan managed
to put it out before it got to my face.

Thank God for small favors, huh?

Silence. Colleen zips up the suit, turns to go.

QUINN

She doesn't believe that for a second. Quinn turns her head

Van Zan's soldiers drill with Quinn's firemen. Van Zan
himself sits atop his tank, shouting orders into a MEGAPHONE.

VAN ZAN

The firemen move to reposition themselves. Suddenly, Creedy
stops. As does Eddie and Danny Goodwin and soon all the
rest. Van Zan turns to see they are staring at

Quinn, taking a stand near the tank. He holds his pulaski in
his hands like some sort of medieval weapon. Silence.

VAN ZAN

VAN ZAN
You got a beef with me, come up and
settle it like an adult.
QUINN
Why don't you come down and settle it
like a man?
Van Zan just rolls his eyes.

QUINN
Or do you just do crippled kids?

At that, Van Zan's face goes terribly and utterly dark. In
dead silence, he descends from the Abrams, walks to Quinn.
Slow, imminent. A casual avalanche of rage.

Quinn holds his ground up to the moment Van Zan's upon him.
SLAM! It's not clear who throws the first blow, and it
doesn't really matter. Within moments, the two are letting
into each other with all the fury they can muster.

Creedy tries to intervene, but Gideon holds him back.

GIDEON
He picked it...

The fight quickly degenerates into a brutal mano e mano
street brawl. Neither English or Americans dare interfere.

Easily the better fighter, Van Zan slams Quinn with a series
of blows that sends him to the ground.

But Quinn won't quit. He rises, charges the man, knocks him
back. Van Zan pulls a reversal, hurls Quinn into the tank.

Quinn slumps painfully, but catches himself before falling.
He shakily regains his footing, faces off with Van Zan again.

VAN ZAN
Aren't we just "Mr. Come-and-Get-It"?

Quinn charges and the two come together in a deathlock. An

Goosh looks down nervously at the sight miles below them.

A FINAL FLASH reveals the gothic gargantua of BIG BEN.

But something's odd about the famed clocktower. The shape is
just slightly off-kilter. A moment later, we see why...

ITS SURFACE STARTS TO MOVE!
EXT. COOMBE HILL - NIGHT

The Blackhawk comes to a landing. Van Zan moves towards it
angrily as Colleen gets out.

VAN ZAN
Goddammit, I told you to stay in the

Suddenly, the music STOPS. Van Zan turns toward
THE SOUND VAN

A MAELSTROM CLOUD OF ASH, SWEEPING OVER LONDON,

Row after row of the ash mountains are COMING APART in the

Burning cinders fly through the open windows, falling on
Goosh. His long hair and beard CATCH FIRE.

Goosh panics, trying to put it out. In the process, his hand
accidently slams against the control board. A CD CLICKS on...

Handel's MESSIAH: the "Hallelujah Chorus”.

The firemen grab for their helmets and protective visors.

Goosh falls from the sound truck SCREAMING bloody murder.
His hair and beard are afire, like a bizarre halo.

Quinn runs to him. He pulls off his own jacket, starts
smothering the flames.

All the Firemen and Militia are frozen where they stand.

Even Van Zan is silenced as his greatest adversary rises from

A leviathan's head more terrifying than any biblical monster.
A serpentine body longer than a freight train.

And a 200-foot wing span that blots out the very sky.

THE ASHLEY

No mere animal; she is a force of nature. Like a fallen
angel emanating arrogance and power, she rises to her full

height and greatness before the pathetic human beings.

Now, accompanied by one of the most beautiful pieces of music

He looks down at Goosh. Only the upper part of the man's
body made to the open space. The other half is crushed.

EXT. COOMBE HILL - By THE SOUND VAN - NIGHT
Quinn painfully extricates himself out of the truck.

The place is a disaster area. Fires and smouldering wreckage
everywhere. Smoke drifting. No sign of life.

He hears a GROANING from nearby. He runs over to see Creedy,

Quinn helps him to his feet.

Quinn and the others walk towards its origin

EXT. COOMBE HILL - EDGE OF HILL - NIGHT

They stop, stunned, as the smoke before clears to reveal
THE ASHLEY'S CORPSE

lying along the length of the hill, its smoking skin
stretching to the valley below. Part of its skull is
smashed; its left eye a shattered, glutinous mess.

And atop the great dragon's head stands

VAN ZAN

covered in oil-black blood, hacking away at one of her horns
with a machete-sized piece of metal.

Quinn stares at him. He's like a vision from prehistory: a
blood-soaked savage, viciously cutting a trophy from his
vanquished enemy.

Van Zan notices their stares, stares ferociously back.

With a sickening tearing sound, he RIPS the horn free from
Ashley's skull.

EXT. COOMBE HILL - BY SALAMANDER - A LITTLE LATER ~ NIGHT

Van Zan finishes securing The Ashley's severed horn to the
top of the vehicle. He looks down at

English and Americans. The back is nearly filled to the top

only a partially formed preemie, it's lethal from birth.

The thing coils back, hissing in attack mode.

Colleen draws her side-arm, FIRES, HITTING THE DRAGON DEAD

An idea forms. She turns to another egg nearby.

The three climb down the rusty metal, mindful of the
explosive-filled packs on their backs. Framed by the vast
wall, they look like ants descending into a tarantula's den.
INT. BOTTOM OF CONSTRUCTION HOLE

Quinn drops with a CRUNCH...and finds himself staring at the
CHARRED REMAINS OF THE ELEVATOR in which his mother died.

Quinn stares uneasily at the sight, then looks beyond.

The tunnel before him is filled with ASHLEY'S EGGS. It
stretches like an obscene birth canal.

INT. TUBE TUNNELS - VARIOUS
Quinn, Van Zan and Colleen head into the egg-infested tubes.

They split up silently. Colleen moving west...Quinn heading
south...Van Zan heading East.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)
Van Zan moves down a fully operational section of tube.

He passes by a SUBWAY TRAIN. literally SQUASHED FLAT against
the side of the tunnel.

VAN ZAN
Public transportation.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (COLLEEN)

Colleen follows her tunnel into the open platform of
INT. VICTORIA STATION - PLATFORM (COLLEEN)

She climbs onto the platform, past a sign: MIND THE GAP.
INT. UNCOMPLETED SECTION TUBE TUNNEL (QUINN)

Quinn works his way into the tunnel seen under construction
at the beginning. Loamy earth ribbed with rusted iron.

INT. VICTORIA STATION - ESCALATOR PLAZA (COLLEEN)

Colleen removes the pack from her back, begins to set charges
at the base of an ESCALATOR.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)
Van Zan molds his charges by the flattened subway train.
INT. UNCOMPLETED TUBE TUNNEL #3 (QUINN)

Quinn moves by a "T" intersection. The old TUNNEL BORING
MACHINE (TBM) is parked on the tunnel going off to his right.

Quinn keeps moving straight ahead. It's there he sees
THE ENTRANCE TO THE CAVE
from which The Ashley originally emerged.

Quinn is frozen. Listening. He can't hear anything
indicating the Great Dragon is at home.

He decides to chance it. Barely making a noise, he moves into

INT. CAVERN

No sign of Ashley. However, the chamber is filled with
THOUSANDS OF EGGS. Clinging to the walls, ceiling, etc.

CONTINUED:

Quinn swallows his fear, begins to set his charge there.
INT. VICTORIA STATION - ESCALATOR PLAZA (COLLEEN)
Colleen finishes placing the charge.

It's then she hears it: a DISTANT RUMBLING sound, like a
subway train approaching.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Van Zan hears it, too. ECHOING through the cavernous tunnels.
No way to tell which direction it's coming from.

INT. CAVERN (QUINN)

Quinn's sweating profusely, trying to ignore the sound and
vibrations that resound in this open chamber. Hands shaking,
he places the last of his charges near the eggs.

INT. VICTORIA STATION - ESCALATOR PLAZA

WIND picks up through the plaza, as if a train were coming.

Colleen presses her back against as the sound becomes
DEAFENING. Suddenly, Van Zan's voice echoes in her headset.

VAN ZAN (0.S.)
Which way's it heading? East or West?

Slowly, trembling, she peeks round the corner at

INT. VICTORIA STATION - PLATFORM (COLLEEN)

The MIND THE GAP sign swings violently as

THE ASHLEY

speeds past, filling the length of the tunnel. She's so long
that only her scaly midsection is visible as she rockets
through like a biological subway train.

COLLEEN

darts back against the wall.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Colleen's voice echoes in his headset.

COLLEEN (0.5.)
She's heading right toward you!

Quinn tries to fix his last. charges.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Van Zan takes a stand, ready to meet the creature head on.
He raises the trigger, thumb on the button...

WIND washes down the tunnel...
The RUMBLING BECOMES DEAFENING...and then...
Silence. Sudden, utter, absolute.
Van Zan stares suspiciously at the darkness before him.
VAN 2AN

Colleen...

Quinn. What's your status?
Quinn's voice is unusually tense.

QUINN (0.S.)
Y'know, it's funny...

INT. CAVERN (QUINN)
Quinn stands stock still at the right end of the cavern.

QUINN
...-but I've been better.

a shadow slowly falls over him as

THE ASHLEY RISES BEFORE HIM

(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUEC:

She's entered the cave and moved to the left, wings spreading
to each side, shielding the eggs around her. The scars of
her massive injuries leak pus; she hisses with the venom of a
wounded animal cornering its hunter.

And yet, she does not attack.

It's then Quinn notices: the beast's one remaining eye is
fixed on the explosive in his hand.

Ashley starts to move forward.

Quinn raises the explosive up.

Ashley stops, as if in reaction.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Quinn's whispers voice over Van Zan's headset

QUINN (0.S.)
Get out and blow the charges. Now!

Van Zan stares at the trigger. He looks up uncertainly, then
begins to move down the tunnel.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (COLLEEN)

Colleen begins to run east down her tunnel.

INT. CAVERN (QUINN)

Quinn's engaged in a staring contest with the serpent.
Ashley makes her fire rattle.

QUINN
Bou gonna use that fire around the kids?

Ashley snaris. The rattle fades in her throat.
VAN Z2AN (0.S.)
(Over headset)
Qxinn, listen to me...
INT. UNCOMPIETED TUBE TUNNEL - (VAN ZAN)

Van Zan has reached the "T" intersection. He is staring at

VAN ZAN (0.S.)
Walk back toward the tunnel.

Quinn glances at the opening to the cavern.
INT. UNCOMPLETED TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Van Zan moves down the intersecting tunnel] to his right.

QUINN (0.S.)
(Over headset)
Van Zan, I told you...

VAN ZAN
Do it!

INT. CAVERN (QUINN)

Quinn slowly edges toward the opening, keeping the explosive
raised, keeping his eyes locked with Ashley.

Ashley watches with her working right eye, looking for a
chance to strike without activating Quinn's explosive.

INT. INTERSECTING TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

CLOSE on Van Zan's foot as he steps on a piece of machinery.
INT. HOLE BETWEEN CAVERN AND TUNNEL (QUINN)

Quinn walks backwards into the tunnel as

Ashley slides forward, keeping pace.

INT. INTERSECTING TUBE TUNNEL (VAN Z2AN)

Van Zan's hand brushes dust from a CONTROL PANEL.

INT. UNCOMPLETED TUBE TUNNEL (QUINN)

Quinn comes to the intersection of the t-junction.

Ashley's tongue snakes out of her mouth toward him, just
waiting to get a taste.

QUINN
Any time you're ready. Really.

Quinn passes the t-junction of the intersection.

VAN ZAN'S POV ~ THROUGH A DUSTY WINDOW

(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:

Ashley comes into view. She can't see what lies in the
tunnel to the left of her because of her blinded eye.

VAN ZAN (OS)
That'll do.

Van Zan's hand comes down on a gearshift.
And the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of
THE TUNNEL BORING MACHINE

Barrelling down the tunnel right at Ashley's blind side. Van
Zan in the driver's seat, like a knight on his mount.

Ashley realizes the trap. She tries to pull back...

Van Zan floors it....

THE TBM DRILLS INTO ASHLEY'S NECK, PINNING HER TO THE WALL.
INT. TUBE TUNNEL (COLLEEN)

Running to the eastern tunnels, Colleen hears Ashley's
scream, amplified a hundred-fold. She rounds a corner to see

ASHLEY

Struggling against the TBM. Her tongue LASHES OUT, knocking
Quinn backward.

VAN ZAN
keeps his foot on the TBM's accelerator, keeping her pinned.
COLLEEN

runs to Quinn, helps him to his feet.

VAN ZAN
I've got her here! Get out!!
COLLEEN
No!
QUINN
Van Zan!
VAN ZAN

This is my deal, Goddammit!

Quinn and Colleen look at him. It's as if Van Zan is pouring
all his fury into this final attack.

CONTINUED:

VAN ZAN
Go!!!

There's no time to argue. Quinn and Colleen take off.

INT. TUBE TUNNELS (QUINN AND COLLEEN) ,

The two race for the construction hole.

Ashley's amplified shrieks mix with the metallic grind of the

TBM. It sounds like a mythical battle between two
subterranean giants.

“INT. UNCOMPLETED TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

The dragon THRASHES. The TBM starts to become DISLODGED.

Van Zan keeps up the pressure on the accelerator. But SMOKE
is beginning to pour from the TBM's engines.

INT. BOTTOM OF CONSTRUCTION HOLE

Quinn and Colleen make it to the bottom of the hole. They
Start to climb like hell.

INT. UNCOMPLETED TUBE TUNNEL (VAN ZAN)

Van Zan puts all his effort into the TBM's forward motion.
Machine smoke fills the air.

It's fighting the inevitable. With a horrible grind, the
TBM's motor LOCKS...

...and Ashley tosses her head to the side.
THE TBM

is knocked backward, slamming against the wall with such
force that the cab compartment is CRUSHED.

INT. SIDE OF CONSTRUCTION HOLE

The crash echoes up to the ears of Quinn and Colleen, in the
middle of their ascent.

QUINN
COME ON!!

They double time it toward the surface.
117.

INT. TUBE TUNNEL - BY TBM

Van Zan lies crushed in the wreckage of the cak. He looks up
to see Ashley's face right over him.

Ashley's eye falls upon Van Zan's hand. It has reached the
trigger mechanism.

Van Zan smiles a bloody smile.

VAN ZAN
Kiss my human ass...

Ashley rears back.
Van Zan presses the button.
INT. TUBE TUNNELS - VARIOUS

The explosives DETONATE all along the tunnels...causing A
CHAIN REACTION of even greater explosions from the eggs.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - TOP OF HOLE - NIGHT

Quinn and Colleen have just made it to the surface when the
earth underneath shakes from the underground explosions.

INT. CAVERN

The egg-filled chamber IGNITES. A GIGANTIC BLAST SLAMS
through into

INT. TUBE TUNNEL (ASHLEY)

the concussion is so great it BLASTS the dragon down the
tunnel like a missile through a silo.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - TOP OF HOLE - NIGHT

Huge rents in the ground BREAK OPEN, followed by GEYSERS OF
FLAME. It's as if hell has come to trade places with earth.

Colleen's THROWN BACK by one explosion, falling onto twisted
metal. One shard pierces through her leg. She cries out.

QUINN
Colleen!

Quinn gets to her, picks her up in a fireman's carry.
118.

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT
Quinn races with Colleen down the street. Its like running
through a war zone. Earth shaking...eggs exploding in
fireballs... °
EXT. NEAR THAMES - NIGHT
Nearing the bank, Quinn sees their chance at escape.
THE MOSQUITO
parked in the dry river.
Quinn begins to make for it when suddenly behind them

LEY 1D 5
Her whcle body is AFLAME. A fiery angel, she blasts into the
EXT. SKY OVER LONDON - NIGHT
Climbing hundreds of feet in seconds...higher...higher...
And then begins to DROP, like a flaming comet down to earth.
EXT. NEAR THAMES
Quinn and Colleen look up.

COLLEEN
Smart bitch...

EXT. SKY OVER LONDON

CLOSE ON ASHLEY diving down. She is using the velocity of
hex descent to PUT THE FIRE ON HER BODY OUT.

At fifty feet, the fire's extinguished. She arcs up...

...and sails over Quinn and Colleen. The force of her passing
is like a jet; it knocks both the humans down on the ground.

Ashley doesn't even bother with them now, but heads STRAIGHT
INTO THE INFERNO OF LONDON.

EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

Ashley beats her wings furiously, driving the fire away from
an area where some of her eggs lie undamaged.

(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:

She gathers her eggs to her belly. A FLAP OF SKIN folds out,
revealing a MARSUPIAL-LIKE POUCH. Into this she pulls her
progeny.

ON QUINN AND COLLEEN

looking on in horror.

COLLEEN
Jesus Christ, she's saving her kids!

Quinn makes a snap decision. He immediately heads for
EXT. BANK OF THAMES - NIGHT

With Colleen over his shoulder, Quinn quickly climbs down the
bank into the glassy surface.

EXT. LONDON STREET - BY ASHLEY

Her stomach now BLOATED TO CAPACITY WITH EGGS, Ashley opens
her mouth, catches a dozen or so more under her tongue.

EXT. THAMES RIVER - NIGHT
Quinn gently lays Colleen down by the glassy bottom.
QUINN
Winds blowing north. Fire won't touch
you here.

Quinn turns toward the Mosquito.

COLLEEN
Where are you going?!

Quinn doesn't answer, just books toward the plane.
EXT. LONDON STREET - BY ASHLEY

Now loaded to capacity with her eggs, Ashley begins to take
to the air. She's like an overloaded B-52.

EXT. THAMES RIVER - NIGHT/DAWN

Quinn taxis the Mosquito down the glassy bed, into the air...

Dawn starts to break over the burning city, framing

Ashley, sailing the wind eastward...

INT. MOSQUITO

Quinn's pushing the damaged plane to its limit to catch up.
It starts to SHAKE, barely held together by gum and string.

EXT. OVER THAMES - DAWN

Ashley swoops over the Thames River Barrier to the wet part
of the river.

INT. MOSQUITO

QUINN
Come on, luv...

He lines up the sights on his forward guns.

QUINN
Show me your belly.

He FIRES.
EXT. OVER THAMES - DAWN

Machine gun fire RAKES over Ashley's back. Barely an
annoyance, but she seems to know what Quinn is trying to do.

In reaction, she pitches down toward the river.
INT. MOSQUITO

QUINN
Dammit!

EXT. OVER THAMES - DAWN

Ashley's SKIMMING THE SURFACE OF THE RIVER. Barely 10 feet
above it, the tips of her great wings touch the water on
every downbeat, forcing a wake to form.

The Mosquito follows behind, skimming the surface as well.
INT. MOSQUITO

Quinn maneuvers for a way to get to her egg-filled gut.
EXT. OVER THAMES - DAWN

The Mosquito swerves left, trying to get under Ashley's wing.

(CONTINUED)
121.
CONTINUED:

FLICK! The dragon's tail SNAPS out, nearly striking the
Mosquito's wing.

Quinn swerves just in time.

FLICK! FLICK! The dragon's tail is like a giant fly
Swatter, trying to bat the plane out of the sky.

But each slash of the tail leaves her underside exposed.
INT. MOSQUITO

And Quinn takes advantage, firing his guns.

EXT. OVER THAMES - DAWN

CLOSE ON Ashley's belly. The bullets tear awfully close to
the eggsack.

Ashley counters with a move of her own. She opens her mouth,
begins to release some of the eggs there.

The eggs fall right in the path of the Mosquito which is
Still firing. Its tracer bullet rip into the eggs.

BOOM! The eggs EXPLODE near the plane like depth charges.
INT. MOSQUITO

Jolts rock the plane. Quinn's barely able to stabilize her.
He knows the aircraft can't take much more of this.

EXT. THAMES ESTUARY - DAWN

Ashley speeds down the estuary, headed toward the open sea.
INT. MOSQUITO

Quinn sees accelerates the plane in a final burst of speed.
EXT. COASTLINE - DAWN

Still skimming the water, Ashley passes over the coast and
makes the freedom of the open ocean.

However as she's flies from land to sea
The Mosquito accelerates, FLYING RIGHT OVER HER BACK.
INT. MCSQUITO

Quinn looks down. It's like passing over an island of reptile
skin, her wingspan nearly the size of a football field.

EXT. OVER SEA - DAWN

The Mosquito flies over Ashley's head to take a position
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.

INT. MOSQUITO

QUINN
COME ON! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!

EXT. OVER SEA - DAWN

Ashley sees the challenger in front of her. She decides to
end this once and for all.

She opens her mouth, releasing the last of the eggs kept
there. Then, takes in a HUGE BREATH...

And BLAM! LETS LOOSE HER LARGEST BLAST OF PHOSPHOROUS EVER.

The Mosquito dodges. But the blast TEARS into the ocean fer
a quarter of a mile, sending up a WALL OF SUPERHEATED STEAM.

The Mosquito turns into the steam wall for cover.
Ashley follows, firing another blast.
INT. MOSQUITO

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The sound of multiple phosphorous strikes
hitting the water are like thunder.

Quinn smiles. He begins to puil up.
EXT. OVER SEA - DAY

By striking the water so many times, Ashley has created a
FOGBANK. It's impossible to see within.

EXT. FOGBANK OVER SEA - DAY

Ashley swoops blindly, skimming, listening for Quinn's plane.
The sound of the Mosquito gets farther...farther...

It seems to be heading upward.

Ashley stares up. Now's her chance.

She begins to arc up out of the fog bank...
123.

EXT. OVER FOGBANK - DAY

And sees...nothing. The plane's DISAPPEARED.

But the buzzing is now getting louder. It's then she-notices
THE MOSQUITO

arcing hundreds of feet above her UPSIDE DOWN. It's at
12:00, EXECUTING a wild LOOP over the dragon.

INT. MOSQUITO

In a last desperate move, Quinn, upside down, guides the
plane back over the dragon...

EXT. OVER SEA - DAY
Too late, Ashley realizes what Quinn is doing.

The Mosquito is now diving BEHIND the dragon. Its loop now
is accelerated by its descent.

At the 7:00 point, it begins to PULL UP with huge speed.
What happens next is so quick, it's nearly simultaneous.
QUINN

opens the canopy of his plane.

ASHLEY

tries to dive.

THE MOSQUITO

arcs upward.

QUINN

releases his belt and is sucked from the cockpit.

SLAM! He hits the water at an angle at a savage 70 miles an
hour. His body SKIPS LIKE A STONE over the ocean just as

THE MOSQUITO

is carried in its course by the force of its acceleration...
..-heading right into Ashley's egg-filled stomach.

ASHLEY

Quinn recovers his sense barely in time to see
A SHOCK WAVE

from the blast, swelling right towards him.

s QUINN

He dives just as the WAVE hits him full on.

EXT. UNDERWATER

Quinn is jostled to and fro under the wave.

EXT. OVER SEA

The fiery remains of the dragon fall from the sky like rain.
EXT. UNDERWATER

With his last strength, Quinn kicks with all his might toward
EXT. SEA - SURFACE

Quinn breaks the surface, GASPING for air.

The water around is filled with burning debris.

And there, not ten yards away, floats THE ASHLEY'S SEVERED
HEAD. Bobbing lifeless as it sinks.

Quinn watches it, sees himself reflected in the cornea of its
one eye, just as he had seen himself as a child.

Soon, the reflection and eye and the last of the dragon
disappear under the water.

HOLD ON the burning debris
CROSSFADE TO:

EXT. SEA - A WEEK LATER

Burning debris CROSSFADES into BOATS. All shapes and sizes

EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

CLOSE on a pile of dragon eggs arranged in a huge PIT in the
ground.

CREEDY (OS)
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

An explosive charge DETONATES in the middle of the pit,
reducing the their embryos to lifeless shreds.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Creedy supervising a CREW OF MEN AND
WOMEN in the orderly disposal of remaining dragon eggs.

PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the rest of the park. A myriad
of TENTS are pitched throughout the park. A CARAVAN full of
new arrivals are busy preparing a campsite.

TUFTS OF GREEN GRASS speckle the blackened hills. There's
even a bit of sunlight peeking through the clouds.

PAN OVER to a distant hill where a lone figure stands.
EXT. HYDE PARK - HILL - DAY

It's Quinn standing before what looks like a rough military
graveyard. British flags fly from some; The American from
others. The dead in the war with Ashley.

Quinn kneels down by one that flies the DON’T TREAD ON ME
early American flag with the snake. It's there he places the
flask he took from Van Zan in the boat.

COLLEEN (0.S.)
He actually stole that flask from me.

Quinn turns to see Colleen behind him. No longer wearing her
flight suit, but a dress that covers her arms and legs.

Quinn smiles.

COLLEEN
French delegation's here. They want to
talk about an expedition to retake the
continent.

QUINN
You wanna be in on it?

COLLEEN
Do you?

Quinn shakes his head, looks down at the grave.

QUINN
Guess we owe it to him to keep fightin’.

COLLEEN
Just him, huh?

She nods at Beth and a group of the castle kids, playing
soccer nearby.

COLLEEN

Won't exactly be a cakewalk. They say

there's at least four of 'em in Paris.
QUINN

That's not what bothers me, Col.

(Looks at her.)

What if Van Zan was wrong about Ashley?

What if there still other females? What

do we do then?

Colleen takes his hand.

COLLEEN
We live.

Hearing his own words thrown back at him, Quinn has to smile.
He kisses her gently, puts his arm around her.
They walk together from the graveyard.

Toward a city being reborn.

FADE TO BLACK:
