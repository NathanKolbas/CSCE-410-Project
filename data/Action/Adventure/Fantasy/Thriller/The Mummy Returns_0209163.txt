The Universal Pictures Globe DISSOLVES into a GOLD DISC,
embossed with a gold SCORPION. The gold disc is the masthead
at the top of a banner being carried by an AKKADIAN SOLDIER.
SIX THOUSAND AKKADIAN SOLDIERS march with him.

NINE THOUSAND SUMERIAN SOLDIERS are coming at them from
across the golden dunes. Behind the Sumerians is the massive
walled CITY OF THEBES: palaces, temples, needles, --the
works. The Nile runs alongside it.

ARDETH BEY (0.s.)
Six thousand years ago, a fierce
warrior known as the Scorpion King,

led a great army on a campaign to
unite the known world.

A powerful FIST is thrust into FRAME, clenching a scimitar,
a GOLD BRACELET adorns the warrior’s wrist. Muscular, brutal
looking and heavily scarred, this is the SCORPION KING. The
spooky thing about him is that through a strange Akkadian
tribal ritual, all the skin on his head above his eyebrows

bas been removed, exposing his BLEACHED SKULLCAP. He BELLOWS
a command. He and his soldiers CHARGE FORWARD.

CUT WIDE: as both armies, fifteen thousand men strong, pour
over the golden dunes and CLASH. The Scorpion King fights
like a man possessed. Slowly being swallowed up in the dust.

ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
The Scorpion King and his army
were finally defeated by the
Sumerians and driven deep into
the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.

EXT. THE DESERT OF AHM SHERE - DAY

The remains of the Scorpion King’s decimated army retreats
into the desert.

ARDETH BEY (0.s.)
For three months they wandered
the desert, slowly dying, until
the Scorpion King himself was
the last man left alive.

Alone in the middle of a vast wasteland, the Scorpion King
crawls on his hands and knees, then he looks up into the
heavens, raises his fist in anger, and BELLOWS A CURSE.

ARDETH BEY (0.s.)
On death’s door, he made a pact
with the great god Anubis.
oN

The Scorpion King sees a live SCORPION crawling towards him.
He looks back up to the heavens and sneers, then grabs the

wriggling thing with his bare hands. His face grimaces as it
STINGS HIM. He shoves the scorpion into his mouth and chews.

ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
He swore that if Anubis would spare
him, and let him conquer his enemies,
that he would give Anubis his soul,
and build him a great temple, —a
pyramid of gold.

Suddenly, in a circle around him, --LUSH GREEN VEGETATION
SPRINGS UP OUT OF THE SAND, then EXPLODES OUT EXPONENTIALLY
IN EVERY DIRECTION. SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREEN ARE THE WORDS:

THE OASIS OF AHM SHERE

And then a HUGE HOLE opens up in the ground in front of him.
STAIRS MADE OF SAND lead down into a NETHERWORLD. Grinning
malevolently, the Scorpion King starts down the stairs.

EXT. ANCIENT THEBES COURTYARD — DAY

A decapitated HUMAN HEAD rolls through FRAME, followed by a
HEADLESS MAN, still TWITCHING. And then a big CLAWED FOOT
steps onto the headless man’s chest. TILT UP: to reveal an
extremely evil looking ANUBIS WARRIOR: from the waist down he
has a human exoskeleton covered in striated muscles, from the
waist up he's a hairy Anubis-nheaded creature. He lifts his
scimitar and SHRIEKS in triumph. _
ARDETH BEY (0.8)
The next year, the Scorpion King
stormed northward with the Army
of Anubis. And like a great flood,
washed away all that lay before them.

CUT WIDE: Thousands of hideous Anubis Warriors swarm through
the fantastic and sprawling City of Thebes, now in ruins.
Buildings BURN. Monuments COLLAPSE. People SCREAM.
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREEN ARE THE WORDS:

EGYPT - 3,112 B.C.

ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
He defeated his enemies, united
all of Egypt, became the first
Pharaoh, and created a religion
that would last for a thousand years.

The SCREEN fills with the horrific face of an Anubis Warrior,
he SHRIEKS and then DISSOLVES into BLACK SAND, revealing:

 
om

EXT. THE TEMPLE OF THEBES - DAY

ANCIENT RUINS along the banks of the Nile. Deserted except
for THREE CAMELS. SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREEN are the WORDS:

EGYPT — 1935
INT. EGYPTIAN TEMPLE — DAY

Inside the temple, dozens of GIANT PILLARS rise up from the
rock strewn floor to the cracked ceiling above. A shaft of

dusty sunlight shines in through a doorway. A small FIGURE

in a pith helmet enters, holding a TORCH. The Figure moves

through the pillars and enters a FISSURE in a far wall.

INT. CATACOMBS — DAY

We follow the pith helmeted Figure as he slowly creeps
through spooky catacombs. The walls are covered in dark
hieroglyphics. A scary NOISE is heard. The Figure freezes,
then turns around and faces us: it’s an adorable little
eight-year-old boy. This is ALEXANDER O'CONNELL.

Alex looks around, eyes wide. It’s dark and quiet. And then a
HAND GRABS HIM. Alex SCREAMS. It’s O'CONNELL, looking dashing
and handsome and wearing a sleeveless shirt.

O'CONNELL
Alex, I told you to wait up in
the temple.

ALEX
But Dad--!

O'CONNELL

No “buts”, it’s dangerous down
here. Now be good and I’1l get
ya something when we get home.

ALEX
How about a tattoo?
O'CONNELL
No!
ALEX
But Dad--!
O'CONNELL
No “buts”.
ALEX

You have a tattoo!

bene
Ne

Alex points to a very cool TATTOO emblazoned across

O’Connell‘s muscular upper right arm: a mariner’s compass
pointing down with falcon’s wings pointing up, forming a
pyramid. In the center of the pyramid is the Eye of Isis.

0’ CONNELL
I told you, I was only three or
four when this thing was slapped
on me. I didn’t have a say in it
and neither do you.

O'Connell spins Alex around and gently sends him packing.

O'CONNELL
Now back to the temple big guy.
And keep your fingers off the
furniture.

INT. CHAMBER — DAY

HOT COALS are brushed across ancient engravings chiseled into
a@ wall: TWO SEXY EGYPTIAN PRINCESSES IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.
Evy is doing the brushing, looking quite sexy herself, having
gone a bit “native”. Something HISSES. Evy looks down. Next
to her foot is a BIG BLACK SNAKE. She doesn’t even flinch.

EVY
Go. Away.

Her foot hooks the snake and tosses it across the room.
O'Connell comes through the door. Evy gestures.

EvVY
Watch your head, honey.

Q’CONNELL
It was just Alex.

Not listening, O’Connell SMACKS his head on a low hanging
beam. He YELPS, grabs his head and goes to sit down.

EVY
Don’t sit there.

O’CONNELL
He never listens.

Not listening, O’Connell sits on a rock covered in HOT COALS.
He YELPS and leaps up. Evy just smiles at hin.

EVY
I wonder where he gets that from?
 

O'Connell gives her a forlorn look with his puppy dog eyes.

O'CONNELL
Why can't we have normal vacations
like other families?

EXT. TEMPLE — DAY

FOUR EVIL LOOKING CHARACTERS ride up on horses and dismount,
The two BRITISH MEN draw their guns; the two ARABS whip out
their scimitars. This is RED, SPIVEY, ABDUL, and MUHAMMAD.

INT. TEMPLE — DAY

Inside the temple, next to a large gathering of ancient
artifacts, Alex is building some sort of strange CONTRAPTION
out of bamboo shoots, mummy wrappings, and rotted bones.

ALEX
No swords. No scimitars. No bows
and arrows. How's a kid supposed
to have any fun around here?

He's also keeping an eye on some RATS off in the corner.
Suddenly, VOICES are heard. Frightened, Alex looks around,
he spots a forty foot high WOODEN SCAFFOLDING. He quickly
scurries over and starts to climb up. At the top, Alex
bellycrawls across it and looks down over the other side:

Red, Spivey, Abdul, and Muhammad enter the temple, slow and
easy. Guns and scimitars up. Real professionals. A truly
vicious looking crew. Alex’s eyes widen in fear. Muhammad
heads for the fissure in the wall. Red turns to him.

RED
Don’t light it until I yell at ya.

Muhammad nods and slips into the fissure. Spivey has been
staring at Alex’s contraption. Inside it, a piece of CHEESE
sits on a plate. Spivey grabs the cheese. The contraption
GOES CFF. A bamboo shoot SLAPS DOWN HARD onto Spivey’s hand,
--THWACK!! It’s a rat trap. We CUT AWAY on Spivey’s SCREAM.

INT. TEMPLE MUMMY CHAMBER ~ DAY

WHAM! A huge slab hits the ground. Tarantulas and scorpions
flee. Poison asps HISS. The room is filled with creepy half-
eaten mummies. O’Connell holds a pry bar.

O’ CONNELL
~all I’m sayin’ is maybe it’s
time to be normal. You know,
normal mom, normal dad, regular
everyday folks? ‘
 

Evy gestures at the creepy, infested room, incredulous.

Evy
And give up all of this!?

Her hands whip through cobwebs, which stick to her fingers,
she tries to wipe them off as O’Connell enters the room.

O*’ CONNELL
Remind me again why you’ve been
so obsessed with coming here?

EvY
Ever since I had that dream,
this place is all I can think
of. I feel like I've been here.
~I know I've been here.

O'CONNELL
Evy, nobody’s been here, not
in over three thousand years.

Evy grabs a TORCH HOLDER on the wall and pulls it. A hidden
TRAP DOOR suddenly OPENS, revealing a secret passage.

EvVY
Then how do I seem to know
exactly where I’m going?

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

UP ON THE SCAFFOLDING: Alex quietly reaches back into his
rucksack and withdraws a wrist-rocket-style SLING SHOT.
DOWN BELOW: Red, Spivey, and Abdul are viciously ransacking
the artifacts, clearly looking for something.

RED
It ain’t ‘ere, dammit, it
ain’t ‘ere!

SPIVEY

Maybe they ain’t found it yet.

A rock THWACKS Spivey in the head. He SCREAMS. Red and Abdul
nearly jump out of their pants.

RED/ABDUL
What!? WHAT!?

SPIVEY
Something hit me!

They all look around, suspicious.
INT. CATACOMB — DAY

Muhammed creeps up to the~hole that O’Connell just created.
He pulls out several tightly wrapped STICKS OF DYNAMITE.

INT. PRIEST CHAMBER — DAY
O'Connell steps into a dark chamber.

O'CONNELL
-maybe it's your ancestors calling.
Yer half Egyptian, maybe it’s some
sorta Primal thing.

Evy sticks her torch into the room and pans it around. As the
torch passes in front of CAMERA the SCREEN FLASHES and we are

i four thousand years: The
room now looks gloriously new and utterly fantastic. On the
far wall, an EGYPTIAN PRINCESS comes out of a DOOR. We don’t
see her face, but we catch a glimpse inside the room: TWO
HUGE SPOOKY WARRIORS stand on either side of an ornate CHEST.
The Princess shuts the door and turns a SUNDIAL on it’s face:
twice to the right, once to the left, locking it. She starts
to leave. O'Connell walks through her. THE SCREEN FLASHES.
The chamber is ancient and dark once again. O’Connell steps
up to the door. He didn’t see any of it.

O’ CONNELL
Allow me.

He slams the prybar into the door seam and starts prying.
Evy waves her torch around, trying to get that flashback
thing to happen again, looking a bit wigged-out. O’Connell
sees it in her eyes, he stops prying, concerned.

O'CONNELL
Another one of those.., visions?

’ Evy quickly covers with a smile.

EVY
It’s nothing, really.

O’ CONNELL
What do you mean it’s nothing?
C’mon Evy, this’s been goin’
on for nine years.

Evy just nods, a bit concerened herself.

EVY
Yes, ever since we left Hamunaptra.
 

|
l

 

O’Connell starts prying again, grunting and groaning.

O'CONNELL
It’s like goin’ there triggered
some ancient memories or somethin’.

Evy grabs the sundial; turns it twice to the right, once to
the left. The door opens. She gives O‘Connell a nervous look.

EVY
I think perhaps the answer lies
on the other side of this door.

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

Spivey bends over to look into a sack filled with trinkets.
UP ON THE SCAFFOLDING: Alex fires the SLING SHOT and ducks.
Spivey grabs his ass and leaps up SCREAMING.

SPIVEY
OH MY GOD THAT HURT!

Again, Red and Abdul scan the temple suspiciously.

INT. CATACOMBS - DAY

Muhammad jimmys the sticks of dynamite into the wall.

INT. CHEST CHAMBER — DAY

Evy and O'Connell slowly creep into the chamber. Evy turns

to her left, --a SOLDIER MUMMY IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HER.
Evy SCREAMS and jumps back. O’Connell instantly leaps forward
and swings his pry bar, decapitating the mummified Soldier
Mummy. It’s head ricochets off the walls.

Evy steps up with her torch to reveal that there are actually
TWO Soldier Mummies, the same spooky warriors we saw in her
vision, now mummified, standing guard on either side of the

same ornate CHEST, now covered in spiderwebs. The GOLD DISC
from the first shot of the movie sits on top of the chest.

EVY
Oh my god, the Scorpion King.

O’CONNELL
Bad guy?

EVY
The worst.

Evy kneels down and starts analyzing the chest.
Evy
But he’s always been considered
a myth. No trace of him has ever
been found, no artifacts, no writings...

O'Connell tries to get her pumped up.

O'CONNELL
This is the perfect cap to your
career. The final feather in
your hat! You'll be the toast
of the Bembridge Scholars! Now
we can finally settle down.

Evy gives him a withering look. O’Connell just sighs heavily.

O’ CONNELL
Can't blame a guy for trying.

He SPITS into both of his palms for leverage and grabs the
pry bar. Evy grimaces.

EVY
That’s attractive.

O’Connell SLAMS the pry bar into the seam of the chest.

INT. TEMPLE — DAY

Alex FIRES the SLING SHOT. Abdul spins around and grabs the
rock right out of the air, THWAP! Two inches behind Spivey’s
head. AND he catches eyes with Alex before Alex can duck.
Abdul opens his fist. Spivey and Red see the rock in his
palm. Abdul closes his fist and crushes the rock to powder.

ABDUL
I‘ll take care of this.

He pulls out his scimitar, -~-SHING! Alex’s eyes widen. He
starts backing off down the scaffolding. Red walks forward,
: inf "of the fi .

RED
We're gonna get you NOW!

INT. CATACOMB — DAY
Muhammad is holding a lighter as Red’s VOICE ECHOES in:

RED (0.8.)
NOW! NOW! .Now! —now!

Muhammad LIGHTS the dynamite fuse and hauls-ass.
 

 

i
INT. TEMPLE LIBRARY — DAY i

Evy steps up to the:headless Soldier Mummy. A KEY dangles :
from a gold chain around it’s neck. Evy rips it off. i
O’Connell is still prying away at the chest when Evy sticks
the key into it and unlocks it. O’Connell gives her a look.

O'CONNELL
Ya know, we don’t always hafta
do things the easy way.

Evy opens the chest. Cradled inside it is the same thick GOLD
BRACELET we saw on the Scorpion King’s wrist. The bracelet is

Silosed tight.
INT. TEMPLE — DAY

Abdul’s scimitar is clenched between his teeth as he climbs
up the scaffolding. Alex slowly backs down to the edge of it,
he looks around, there’s nowhere else to go. Abdul is almost
to the top. And that’s when Muhammad comes running in.

MUHAMMAD
Gol GO! GO! The dynamite! It’s
going to blow!

RED
What are you talkin’ ‘bout!?
We ain’t found it yet!

MUHAMMAD
I heard you yell!

SPIVEY
Get back there and pull the fuse!

MUHAMMAD
It’s too late! It’s too late!

Abdul looks down to see his three buddies sprinting out of
the temple, he gives a quick look at the terrified little
boy, snarls at him, then slides all the way down to the
floor. At the bottom, Abdul kicks a balance board out from
under the scaffolding. The scaffolding immediately begins to
ROCK and SWAY. So does Alex. Abdul runs out of the temple.

INT. CATACOMBS — DAY

The dynamite EXPLODES. Rocks and boulders FLY. And then
RAGING WATER comes BLASTING through the hole.

58

INT. SACRED CHAMBER — DAY

O'Connell and Evy are almost blown off their feet. They look
at each other, panicked.

O’CONNELL/EVY
Alex.

O'Connell quickly throws the disc into the chest, slams it
shut, shoves it into his rucksack, slings the rucksack areund
his shoulder, grabs Evy’s hand and RUNS LIKE HELL.

INT. TEMPLE — DAY

The scaffolding is SWAYING WILDLY. Alex is still on his
feet at the top, desperately trying to maintain his balance.

INT. LIBRARY — DAY

O'Connell and Evy run out of a tunnel and jag left. A MASSIVE
GEYSER OF WATER BLASTS OUT behind them. They find themselves
trapped at a dead end, overlooking a deep chasm, it’s walls

filled with thousands of shelves packed with papyrus scrolls.

EVY
Oh my god! It’s the Library Of
Alexandria! It’s beautiful!
It's magnificent!

0’ CONNELL
It's in our way.

O'Connell rips out a grappling hook from inside his rucksack.
He starts to swing it. Evy is ecstatic over the find.

Evy
It’s the eighth wonder of the world!

MASSIVE BLASTS OF WATER suddenly GUSH out of every door and
crevice in the place. Destroying everything.

O’ CONNELL
Not anymore.

O'Connell throws the grappling hook over a beam, grabs Evy
around the waist and JUMPS. The two of them SWING across the
deep chasm, which is being BLASTED BY GEYSERS OF WATER. They
make it to the other side and race into an open fissure.

INT. TEMPLE — DAY
The scaffolding: SLAMS into a huge pillar. The pillar STARTS

TO FALL. The scaffolding starts to COLLAPSE. Alex LEAPS off
the collapsing scaffolding and onto the falling pillar.
 

12

INT. ANTECHAMBER — DAY

O’Connell and Evy are swept off their feet by a TORRENT OF
RAGING WATER. They get trapped in a small chamber which is
filling up quick. O'Connell rips a pick out of his rucksack
and starts picking away, trying to smash his way out.

INT. TEMPLE — DAY

Alex slides down the falling pillar and OUT OF FRAME. The
falling pillar SLAMS into the next pillar, which falls and
SLAMS into the next pillar, and onward it goes. The CAMERA
PANS 360 degrees with the falling pillars as they all DOMINO.
The CAMERA ends on Alex just as he rises to his feet. He
leoks around at the completely destroyed temple, stunned.

ALEX
Oops.

INT. ANTECHAMBER — DAY

The chamber is almost completely filled. The air is almost
gone. O'Connell looks at Evy. Evy looks at O0’Connell. Both
desperate. HIS EYES. EYES. The water SWALLOWS THEM UP.

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

Alex hears a NOISE and looks up. The last pillar hasn’t
completely fallen, it’s stuck on a beam and slowly slipping.
Alex races over to the massive pillar and pushes with all his
might, trying to stop it from falling. David versus Goliath.

INT. ANTECHAMBER — DAY

UNDER THE SWIRLING WATER: O'Connell and Evy wrap their arms
around each other and hug tight.

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

Alex loses the fight. The giant pillar FALLS and CRASHES
right through a hieroglyphed wall, --a huge GUSH OF WATER
EXPLODES OUT from the new hole in the wall. Evy and O’Connell
are poured out through the hole and thrown across the floor.
They slide up next to Alex, gasping for air, exhausted and
stunned. Alex looks down at his parents, then around at the
huge mess that was once the beautiful temple, then he looks
back down at his parents, terrified.

ALEX
Mom. Dad. Count to ten.
mom,

EXT. DESERT DIG SITE — NIGHT

FLOODLIGHTS sweep across a large DESERT DIG SITE, picking

up glimpses. of..ancient.ruins, a fleet of 1930's trucks and
bulldozers, and over a HUNDRED NATIVE DIGGERS. FIFTY HEAVILY
ARMED ARAB MEN in BLACK TURBANS and long robes are spread out
and keeping an eye on the Diggers and the dark desert beyond.
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREEN ARE THE WORDS:

BAMUHAPTRA — CITY OF THE DEAD
EXT. OPEN TENT — NIGHT
The black BOOK OF THE DEAD slams down onto a dusty table.

LOCK~NAH (0.8.)
The Book Of The Dead gives life.

The gold BOOK OF AMUN RA is slammed down next to it.

LOCK-NAH
The Book Of The Living takes it away.

A gorgeous, sultry, young WOMAN with long black hair and
tight fitted khakis blows dust off the books. This is MEELA.
She looks up at a tall, spaoky looking MAN wearing a RED
TURBAN. This is LOCK-NAH. Meela gives him an evil smile.

MEELA
We're getting close.

EXT. SAND PIT — NIGHT

Down inside a nearby sand pit, a group of Diggers work away.
Staring down from above is a very pious appearing fellow with
an evil edge. This is the HIGH PRIEST. He turns as a LAND
ROVER pulls up out of the darkness. Red and Spivey jump out.
The High Priest is too excited to notice their nervous looks.

HIGH. PRIEST
Did you acquire it!?

Before they can even answer the ground suddenly SHAKES. Red,
Spivey and the High Priest stop in their tracks. The ground
SHAKES AGAIN. More violent now. Closer.

The Diggers in the pit look around, wide-eyed. Then something
familiar happens: A MOUND OF SAND BEGINS TO RISE UP out of
the bottom of the pit. The Diggers stare at it, transfixed.
And then the mound BURSTS OPEN AND A THOUSAND SCARABS EXPLODE
UP OUT OF IT.
14

The Diggers SCREAM in terror and frantically try to scramble
up out of the sandy pit, grasping for purchase, legs and
hands churning away in the sand, their progress nightmarishly
slow. The SWEEPING. FLOODLIGHTS make it all the more kinetic
and creepy. And then the hideous bugs overtake the SCREAMING
Diggers and start eating them alive.

Red and Spivey freak out and scramble back up into their
jeep. The High Priest just grins.

INT. TENT — NIGHT
Hearing the horrible SCREAMS, Meela calmly looks at Lock-Nah. ©

MEELA
We’re getting very close.

EXT. SAND PIT ~— NIGHT

A Digger stumbles up out of the pit, MULTIPLE SCARABS are
CRAWLING UNDER HIS SKIN. Red and Spivey SCREAM. The Digger
opens his mouth, --SCARABS POUR OUT OF IT. Red and Spivey
SCREAM LOUDER.

Men in BLACK TURBANS race forward, using FLAME-THROWERS to
chase the CHITTERING scarabs back into the pit. Behind them,
men in RED TURBANS begin to SHOUT with excitement and point
to a LARGE CRANE swiveling over some ruins; a big ROCK
hanging from its claw.

The High Priest sees this and is completely elated and
distracted, he quickly scurries off for the crane.

HIGH PRIEST
We found him! We found him!

Meela and Lock-Nah stride out of the tent, followed by two
red turbaned men, each carrying one of the books. A Servant
bows for Meela and opens the back door to a créme colored
Rolls Royce convertible. Meela dismisses him offhand, then
stops near the pit and grabs the gold book.

MEELA
They used this book to
condemn Imhotep, correct?

LOCK-NAH
That is so.

MEELA
It is the only thing that can
harm him, yes?
LOCK-NAH
Yes.

Meela flings the. gold book into the pit. We hear scarabs
CHITTER from below as they scurry out of it’s way. Meela and
Lock-Nah continue on. Red and Spivey slide out of the jeep.

SPIVEY
Did you see that!? That book
was made of gold! Pure gold!

Red is still shaken, he wipes the sweat off his brow and
sarcastically gestures into the pit.

RED
Feel free.

Spivey stares at the pit, greedily licking his lips. A
bulldozer shoves a mound of sand into it. Scarabs CHITTER
wildly as they are buried. Spivey and Red shiver in disgust.

The High Priest, Meela and Lock-Nah stride up to the crane
just as the claw sets the big rock down. Molded inside the
reck is a horribly deformed PETRIFIED CORPSE. A nightmare in
stone. The High Priest grins.

HIGH PRIEST
Imhotep.

With a devious smile, Meela caresses the corpse’s cheek.
Leck-Nah lifts up a large BLACK URN covered in hieratic.

LOCK-NA
Now we must raise those who served him.

The High Priest nods, then turns as Red and Spivey walk up.

HIGH PRIEST
The bracelet! Give me the bracelet.

RED
We, uh, missed our chance.

Meela and Lock-Nah are stunned. The High Priest is furious.

HIGH PRIEST
Me need that bracelet.

Meela gently touches his shoulder.
MEELA

I told you Lock-Nah and I
should have handled it.
16

HIGH PRIEST —
I did not want your.

(pause) ~~ .
«past history, to cloud the issue.

Spivey tries to be reassuring.

SPIVEY
Don‘t worry, we know where it is,
we'll take care of it.

HIGH PRIEST
No. We‘ll take care of it.
(gives them a creepy grin)
I have a different chore for you now.

Meela scowls at Red and Spivey.
MEELA

What happened to the O’Connell’s?
Did you at least kill the woman,

as I asked?
RED
No, they escaped.
MEELA

Where are they!?

SPIVEY
They’re headed back home-~
(finally noticing the corpse)
--to ...London.

Red and Spivey stare at the corpse, a bit creeped out.
Lock-Nah whispers to the High Priest.

LOCK-NAH
London is also where the Scepter
of Osiris resides.
The High Priest gives Lock-Nah and Meela a very ominous look.

HIGH PRIEST
Then London is where we must go.

EXT. LONDON — DAY
HIGH ANGLE of 1933 LONDON: Big Ben, the House of Commons, and

the river Thames twinkling under Tower Bridge. Thick dark
THUNDERHEADS are rolling in, torn by FLASHES OF LIGHTNING.
 

 

EVY (0.8.)}
That bracelet, I believe, is a
legend, a map, of some sort,
to the Lost Oasis of Ahm Shere.

EXT. BELGRAVIA — DAY

WE PAN DOWN the gorgeous white townhomes of Belgravia until
we see O'Connell through some huge bay windows, carrying
suitcases and heading into their library.

O'CONNELL
Evy, I know what your thinking and
the answer is “no”. We just got
home. We haven’t even unpacked.

Evy passes in front of the library windows.

EVY
That’s the beauty of it, we’re
already packed!

INT. O'CONNELL HOME LIBRARY — DAY

The O’Connell library is an eccentric, disheveled, private
museum, two stories high, filled with tons of books and lots
ancient artifacts. O’Connell drops the suitcases.

©’ CONNELL
Evy!

EVY
It’s just an oasis, dear, a
beautiful oasis.

O’CONNELL
Right, palm trees, cool water,
cozy beach, what’s the catch?
There’s always a catch.

Alex staggers under the weight of the Scorpion King chest.

ALEX
Ugh! This sucker weighs a
god-dang ton!
EVELYN
(scolding)
Alex!
ALEX

(posh English)
Rather weighty, this.

 

17
 

Evy hustles around the library, gathering books and papers.

EVY
The Ancients believed Ahm Shere
is where the evil Army of Anubis
awaits the order to destroy mankind.

O'Connell is right behind her.

O'CONNELL
Evil army?

Evy
They are commanded by a vicious
warrior known as the Scorpion King.

O’ CONNELL
Vicious warrior? See, I knew there
was a catch.

EVY
It’s written, that the Scorpion
King awaits a challenger, one who
may defeat him and wrest control
of this army. If the victor is
good, the earth is saved--

EXT. O'CONNELL TOWNHOME — DAY

18

A LIMOUSINE pulls up and stops. The TWO SINISTER MEN up front
wear RED TURBANS. They look up at Evy in the library windows.

EVY
--but if the victor is evil,
he shall destroy Mankind.

In the back of the limo are FOUR MORE MEN. Lock-Nah rolls

down the window and sticks a pair of BINOCULARS to his eyes.

BINOCULAR POV: Alex crosses the bay window lugging the CHEST.

ALEX
Tell him about the gold pyramid!
A single block of it would be
worth a bloody fortune!

O’CONNELL/EVY
ALEX!

INT. O'CONNELL LIBRARY — DAY
Alex sets the chest down and looks at his dad, confused.
o™

19

What?! “Bloody” fortune, “God-dang”
fortune? Whose language am I
supposed: to speak? Hers or yours?

Evy shakes her head and continues on.

Evy
He's incorrigible.

O’Connell heads after her, pointing a finger at Alex.

O*’CONNELL
And I was gonna give you that tattoo.

ALEX
Yeah, right.

Evy climbs up the spiral stairs to the book~filled balcony.

EVY
In 2,400 B.C., Ramses V dispatched
the last known expedition to Ahm
Shere, which included more than
a thousand armed men.

o’Connell is hot on her heels.

O’CONNELL
Don’t tell me, none of them was
ever seen again, right?

EVY
Neither was the oasis, whose
exact location was lost to the
sands of time. .

O’ CONNELL
I’m thinking it should stay that way.

EVY
Alexander The Great sent troops
in search of it.

O'CONNELL
Evy.

Evy
So did Caesar.

O’CONNELL

Evy!

 

 
EVY
And Napoleon!

O’ CONNELL
Ew!

Startled, Evy looks at him, her next sentence petering off.

Evy
None of them wever —returned..

O'CONNELL
And chances are, neither would we.

Alex hears a loud CLICK coming from INSIDE THE CHEST.
Surprised, he looks at it, then pulls the key out of his
pocket and starts to open the chest.

UP IN THE BALCONY: O'Connell steps up close to Evy.
O* CONNELL
Evy, the other day we were that
close to buying the farm.

EVY
Why would we buy a farm?

O'CONNELL
Died. We almost died.

EvY
Oh thank goodness, I’d rather
die than buy a farm.

Alex opens the chest, inside it the bracelet is now OPEN.
Alex stares at it, then sneaks a look up at his parents.

O'CONNELL
If we died, who'd raise Alex?
Jonathan?

EvY
Oh my God.

O*’ CONNELL
Exactly.

Alex rolls up his jacket sleeve and sets his wrist into the
open bracelet. It suddenly SNAPS SHUT. Alex's eyes fly open
in surprise. He leaps back, staring at the bracelet.

UP ABOVE: O’Connell takes Evy in his arms.
21

O’CONNELL
When I first fell for you, I
wanted to hang up my guns right
then, but you were just finding
your wings, so I figured a few
more adventures wouldn’t kill me.
Well, .the last one almost did.

And then something mystical happens around Alex: the area
around him fills with a strange, three dimensional VISION of
the GIZA PLATEAU: three pyramids, one Sphinx. All brand new.
UP ON THE BALCONY: O'Connell and Evy are oblivious to it.

O*’ CONNELL
Evy, I’ve been riding hard since
I was five years old, hell, I
joined the Foreign Legion just so
I could get some free room and board.

Evy stares up into O’Connell’s eyes. He looks tired and beat.
And then Alex’s vision races down the Nile and across the
desert. Stopping at the TEMPLE OF KARNAC, circa 2000 B.C.,
then it dissipates and vanishes. Alex just stares at the
bracelet on his wrist, wide-eyed. Evy hugs O’Connell tight.

Evy
Wellll, the Bembridge Scholars
dave been begging me to run the
British Library.

She smiles. O'Connell grins. They start to kiss, gently.

Alex rattles his head, then frantically starts fumbling with
the bracelet, trying to get it off; there’s no clasp or hasp,
it almost looks fused shut. O’Connell starts down the stairs.

O’ CONNELL
I'm going to run over to Jonathan's,
get my car back.
(he heads out the door)
Alex! Behave yourself for a few
minutes will ya!

Alex quickly rolls his sleeve down over the bracelet and
SLAMS the chest shut.

ALEX
You bet!

Evy starts down the stairs. Alex picks up the chest, it’s
light, he quickly sets it down, keys it open, grabs a heavy
VASE off a table, shoves it into the chest and slams it shut
again. Evy rounds the bookcase and ruffles Alex’s hair.
 

EVY
You ready to settle down for
a bit, my little man?

He gives her a big innocent smile.

ALEX
Hey, if you guys are happy,
itm happy.

INT. LIMOUSINE — BELGRAVIA — DUSK

The limousine is now empty except for the two men up front,
watching O’Connell walking east down Belgravia road. The
Driver STARTS THE ENGINE. And that’s when a TAXI pulls up
from the west and stops. The rear door opens. A great pair of
camel skin BOOTS step out. It’s ARDETH BEY, still dark and
handsome. He’s holding a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. His gorgeous
eyes scan the street.

INT. LIMOUSINE — DUSK

The two Red Turbans in the limousine see him and duck down,
looking shocked. One of them whispers to the other:

TURBAN
Medjai!
EXT. PEMBRIDGE STREET - DUSK

O*Connell rounds a corner and comes to a dead stop. He rolis
his eyes and shakes his head.

O’CONNELL
No. It hasn’t grown on me.

He stares up at an incredibly GAUDY BUILDING; the garish
FLASHING NEON LIGHTS say it all:

JONATHAN'S!
Egyptian Casino

INT. BEDROOM — DUSK

A ekinny white guy, wearing only boxer shorts and knee-high
black socks, leaps out of a bathroom, pirouettes in mid-air,
slides across the wooden floor and skids to a stop with his
arms raised high. It’s JONATHAN. :

JONATHAN
TA-DAAAA!
 

The High Priest and four vicious Men in red turbans stand
inside the room staring at him. Jonathan turns a shade
redder than their turbans, then looks at the High Priest.

JONATHAN
You‘re not Sheila’s father are you?

HIGH PRIEST

No.
JONATHAN

Well uh, thank goodness for that!
HIGH PRIEST

We asked “Sheila” to step out.
JONATHAN

Ah! I see.

The Men start moving in on hin.

JONATHAN

Or maybe I don’t.
The men grab him and pull him down into an overstuffed chair.

HIGH PRIEST
We're looking for the Scepter
of Osiris.

JONATHAN

Good! Good for you! Good thing to
have, the old Scepter of Osiris!

HIGH PRIEST
Where is it?

JONATHAN
Ah! You’re looking bere, for the,
uh, scepter. I see, well, I have no
idea what you’re talking about.

THE HIGH PRIEST
You took it from Hamunaptra. We
were told that it never leaves
your side, that you carry it
around like some pompous prince.

One of the men sticks a knife under Jonathan's throat.

JONATHAN
Maybe if you gave me a description?
NY

HIGH PRIEST
It is exactly this long, made of
pure gold, capped with a perfectly
round black amethyst and adorned
with a cartouche of the thirteen
gods of ancient Egypt.

JONATHAN
Could you be a trifle more specific?

The knife digs into Jonathan’s throat.

JONATHAN
I lost it in a card game!!

HIGH PRIEST
For your sake, I hope not.

Meela steps out of the shadows, dressed to the nines, gold
and diamonds glitter across her silky skin. She holds a
WOODEN BOX in one hand and seductively caresses Jonathan’s
cheek with the other.

MEELA
Hello.

Jonathan gets a little excited.
JONATHAN
Well hello there.

Meela sets the box on a nightstand, then opens it and stares
inside. Her hand suddenly blurs into the box and pulis out a
poisonous ASP by the neck. Jonathan withers. Meela smiles.

MEELA
Egyptian Asps are quite poisonous,
but the venom tends to work very
slowly, very painfully.

Meela and her asp head for Jonathan, the asp HISSES and
struggles, really pissed-off.

MEELA
Most men, when bitten, beg to
be put out of their misery long
before the poison takes full effect.

JONATHAN
Upstairs! In my office! There's
a@ safe. It’s behind a rather
flattering painting of me. The
combination is 3-20-58.

 
i

Meela starts to stick the asp up to Jonathan's neck, his eyes
bulge out of his head.

JONATHAN
Hey! Wait! I told you! I TOLD you!

MEELA
And your point is?

JONATHAN
My point js I told you so you
wouldn't kill me!

MEELA
When did we make that arrangement?

She squeezes the asp’s neck. It’s jaws open, revealing sharp
fangs. Jonathan starts to SCREAM. And that’s when the door is
KICKED OPEN and O’Connell steps in. Meela, the High Priest
and all the Turbans spin around. O’Connell just nods.

O'CONNELL
Howdy.

There’s a tense moment as the bad guys try and decide what to
do. O’Connell sighs heavily, not really up for a fight.

O'CONNELL
Okay folks, knowing Jonathan,
I’m sure he deserves whatever
you're about to do to him.

JONATHAN
(sarcastic)
Thank you, thank you ever so much.

O'CONNELL
But he’s my brother-in-law and
my wife would kill me if I let
you do it, sooo.

Meela suddenly throws the asp at O'Connell. O'Connell
snatches it right out of the air, holding it by it’s neck.
O'Connell looks into Meela’s gorgeous eyes.

O’CONNELL
Nice Asp.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE: Turban #1 lets go of Jonathan and
draws a pistol. O’Connell throws the Asp at him, which
tangles around his“hand. The man SCREAMS and flaiis with the
snake. The snake BITES HIS FACE. The man SCREAMS LOUDER.
Turban #2 pulls the knife away from Jonathan's neck. Jonathan
immediately throws himself backwards, the chair topples over
and spills Jonathan ‘onto’the floor. Turban #2 FLINGS the
knife at O'Connell. O’Connell snatches it out of the air.
FLINGS it right back at him, impaling him in the chest. He
falls to the floor in front of Jonathan, who doesn’t even
slow down, just crawls right up and over the dead guy.

Meela and the High Priest back away as O’Connell heads for
Jonathan, who is quickly crawling for the bathroom.

O'CONNELL
Time to go, Jonathan.

JONATHAN
I.have to go to the bathroom.

O'CONNELL
You can hold it.

JONATHAN
No I can’t!

Jonathan scrambles into the bathroom. O'Connell can’t believe
this, he forces a smile at Meela and the High Priest. Meela’s
EYES swivel, looking behind O’Connell. O’Connell sees it and
immediately DIVES out of the way just as Turban #4 strides
through the bedroom door and OPENS UP with a machine-gun.

The radiator is HIT, STEAM SHOOTS OUT, CLOUDING THE ROOM.
O’Connell hits the floor, rolls into the bathrooom, pops up
onto his feet and SLAMS the door shut.

INT. BATHROOM — DUSK

Jonathan scoops up his clothes and the SCEPTER OF OSIRIS; a
thick, short, rather innocuous looking gold scepter.

JONATHAN
This is what they’re looking for!
Must be worth more than I thought!

O'CONNELL
Are you crazy!?

The bathroom door is suddenly RIPPED APART by machine-gun
fire. O'Connell and Jonathan DUCK.

O'CONNELL
Who the hell are these guys!

The bullets RIP through the door and TEAR the far wall APART.
JONATHAN
I don’t know! I haven’t done
anything to anybody!

O’Connell runs full bore at the far wall and CRASHES through
it. Jonathan tight on his tail.

JONATHAN
Lately.

INT. O'CONNELL TOWNHOME - DUSK

Evy is frisking Alex, looking for something as the DOORBELL
CHIMES in the background.

EVY
Just a moment! ~Now where is
that key, Alex? I want to see
that bracelet.

ALEX
(tying) .
I lost it! But it’s somewhere!
I'll find it. Don’t worry. Just
go do something and 1/11 find it.

The DOORBELL CHIMES again.
EVY
JUST A MOMENT! Alex, sometimes
you can be so exasperating.
Evy gives up on Alex and starts to head across the room. Alex
quickly grabs the chest and starts to sneak off behind her.
Lock-Nah suddenly steps into the room right in front of Alex.

LOCK-NAH
Give me that chest.

Alex skids to a stop, shocked. Evy spins around.
: Evy
Who are you? What are you
doing in here? Get out!

LOCK-NAH
The chest! Give it to me now!

Evy quickly grabs a big Roman SWORD off the wall.

EVY
I’11 give you something, alright.

 
 

Alex can’t believe what he’s seeing.
o™
Lo ALEX
~ Whoa, Mom, maybe not the best idea.

And then three more RED TURBANS step out behind Lock-Nah,
carrying scimitars. Alex swallows hard.

ALEX
Definitely not the best idea.

LOCK-NAH
Now we will kill you and take
it anyway.

ARDETH BEY (0.8.)
I. think not.
All eyes go to Ardeth Bey, who glides up next to Evy.

ARDETH BEY
I hope you don’t mind, I let
myself in.

It’s obvious Evy hasn’t seen him in a long time.
. EVELYN
& Ardeth??
Lock-Nah gives him a hard stare.

LOCK-NAH
Ardeth Bey.

Ardeth Bey looks at Lock-Nah, then pulls a sword out of the
bouquet and lets the flowers drop to the floor.

: ARDETH BEY
Lock-Nah.

Lock-Nah and his men CHARGE FORWARD. Ardeth Bey and Evy PARRY
their biows. Ardeth Bey takes on Lock-Nah and another guy.
Amazingly, Evy goes sword-to-sword with the other two,
LUNGING, THRUSTING, FEINTING and PARRYING like a pro. Alex
dodges out of the way with the chest, he can’t believe it.

ALEX
Wow! Mum! When did you learn
to do that?
Evy can’t believe it either.
EVELYN

oo I have no idea.

 
 

One of the Turbans slams Evy up against a wall. He leans
forward and laughs with rotted yellow teeth. Evy cringes,
then KNEES him in-the-balls, he SCREAMS and bends over, she
KNEES him in the face, he YELPS and pops back up, she decks
him with a RIGHT HOOK. He goes down and out.

EVELYN
That, I learned from your father.

Another Turban Guy CHARGES forward. Evy parries and feints.
INT. CASINO — NIGET

Q’Connell and Jonathan EXPLODE through a plate glass window
up on the casino’s second floor balcony. They hit the floor
running and CRASH right through the wooden railing.

O'Connell drops down onto a stage filled with gorgeous
BELLYDANCERS. The Dancers all SCREAM and run. O’Connell
leaps off the stage and finds himself under a big central
STAIRCASE facing a huge Guy in a red turban. The Guy rips a
FIRE AXE off the wall and SWINGS IT at O’Connell. O’Connell
leaps out of the way. The axe SMASHES through a support beam,
tearing it clean off. O'Connell looks up. There’s only one
more beam holding the staircase up.

Jonathan dangles from a huge CHANDELIER ringed with dozens of
tiny KEROSENE LAMPS. Turban #4 with the machine-gun steps out
and aims it at Jonathan. And that’s when several of the
chains holding the chandelier to the ceiling BREAK LOOSE.

The Machine-gunner OPENS FIRE as Jonathan and the chandelier
SWING down and across the casino and CRASH into the LIQUOR
SHELVES above the bar. The liquor CATCHES FIRE. WHOOSH! The
entire side of the casino goes up. Whiskey bottles EXPLODE
like Molotov cocktails. Everyone is RUNNING and SCREAMING.

O'Connell shucks and jives away from the Guy swinging the
axe, and at the same time he’s PILEDRIVING his fists into
the big Guy’s face and stomach.

Jonathan crouch-runs behind the bar, still holding the
Scepter of Osiris. The Machine-gunner starts down the
staircase, spraying the bar with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
Jonathan is suddenly trapped in a corner.

O'Connell backs into the last support beam, it looks like
he’s trapped as well. The big Guy smiles and SWINGS the axe.
O'Connell ducks. The axe cuts the beam in two. 0’Connell
dives out of the way. The big Guy looks up as the entire
staircase CRASHES DOWN ON HIM, taking the Machine-gunner
along with it. O'Connell dashes for Jonathan.

INT. O’CONNELL LIBRARY — NIGHT i

The library is getting trashed as the battie rages. Still
holding the chest, Alex slams his body against a bookshelf.
It TOPPLES over and CRUSHES one of the Turban Guys. Another i
Guy xuns up and grabs a handle on the chest. He and Alex

start having a tug-of-war. The Guy finally rips the chest

away. Ardeth Bey leaps over and skewers him. The Guy drops

the chest. Ardeth Bey YELLS at Evy as Lock-Nah attacks him.

ARDETH BEY
What’s in the chest!?

Evy knocks another Turban Guy into a big glass case which
TOPPLES over and SMASHES to smithereens.

EVELYN
A bracelet! Belonging to the
Scorpion King!

Ardeth Bey is shocked.

ARDETH BEY
You have the bracelet!? Get it!
Get it now and get out of here!

EVY
But--{

ARDETH BEY
~-NOW! They must not get the bracelet!

Evy drops her sword and picks up the chest. And that’s when a
huge MOUNTAIN OF FLESH wearing a red turban roars out of the
shadows, scoops Evy up and tears through a side curtain.

This distracts Ardeth Bey. Lock-Nah SLICES him across the
arm. Ardeth Bey tumbles back over a display case. Then Lock~
Nah sees Alex sitting up against a far wall. He THROWS his
scimitar. It whips end-over-end across the room. Alex dodges
left just as the scimitar SLAMS into the wall, two inches
from his head. Lock-Nah races out through the curtains.

EXT. CASINO — NIGHT

It’s POURING RAIN as O’Connell and Jonathan sprint down the
street, accompanied by the SOUND of onrushing FIRE ENGINES.
Behind them, the casino is ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

JONATHAN
That casino was everything I had!
All I’ve got left is this bloody
gold stick!

They come racing around a corner, heading for the O‘Connell
townhome. Ihe limousine almost runs them sown! O’Connell
TACKLES Jonathan out of the way just in time. They both hit
the pavement and roll. --O’Connell sees Evy inside the
limousine, surrounded by the guys in red turbans. The limo
CAREENS around the corner and vanishes. Alex runs up.

ALEX
Dad! DAD!

O'Connell leaps to his feet as Alex runs into his arms.
O'Connell hugs him tight, then he sees Ardeth Bey coming.

O'CONNELL
Ardeth Bey??

Then something dawns on him and he grits his teeth in anger.

0’ CONNELL
Don't tell me.

Ardeth Bey strides up.

ARDETH BEY
Yes, once again someone has
removed Imhotep from his grave.

O'Connell shakes his head. Jonathan is incredulous.

JONATHAN
I don’t mean to point fingers,
but isn’t it your job to make
sure that this doesn’t happen?

ARDETH BEY
He was well hidden under the
ruins of Hamunaptra. But the
woman who is with them, she
knew exactly where to look.

O’ CONNELL
Just like Evy knew exactly
where to find that bracelet.

. ARDETH BEY
That bracelet is what they were after.

Alex rolls up his sleeve to reveal the bracelet.

ALEX
Well they didn’t get it.
 

 

32

Ardeth Bey is shocked, he gently grabs Alex’s wrist and
checks out the bracelet. Alex is very excited.

When I put it on, I saw a mirage,
the pyramids at Giza, then whoosh!
Across the desert to Karnac.

O'CONNELL
(scolding him)
We'll talk about this later.
(then to Ardeth Bey)
You have any idea where these
guys went?

ARDETH BEY
That is why I came to seek you
out. We traced them here to
London, then we lost then.

He pulls out a PHOTOGRAPH of the High Priest.
ARDETE BEY
But wherever this man is, Imhotep
and your wife will surely be.
Alex rips the photo away and stares at it.
ALEX
I know him! He’s the assistant
curator at the British museum.

ARDETH BEY
Are you certain?

O'Connell grabs Alex’s hand, already on the move.
O'CONNELL
Trust him. He spends more time
in that museum than he does at home.
EXT. LONDON STREETS — NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES across a mint condition Rolls Royce Silver
Shadow as it races through the streets of London.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE — NIGHT

O'Connell is at the wheel. Ardeth Bey is in the front
passenger’s seat, he looks over and sees O’Connell’s TATTOO,
partially sticking out of his rolled-up shirt sleeve.

Ardeth Bey looks very surprised.

 

 

 
33

ARDETH BEY
O'Connell, if I said to you: “I
am a stranger traveling from the
east, seeking that which is lost...”

O'Connell is stunned, then confused, he stares out through
the rain whipped windshield, his mind racing back in time.

O'CONNELL
I would reply..: “I am a stranger
traveling from the west, it is
< whom you seek.”

ARDETH BEY
“Then we shall meet in the circle.”

O'CONNELL
“For the sake of the Widow's son."

O'Connell looks at Ardeth Bey, blown away, as if in a dream.

OQ’ CONNELL
My father taught me that. It’s
one of my first memories, my
only recollection of him. I
never knew what it meant.

ARDETH BEY
It means, my friend, that you
are a Masonic Templar.
He rolls up his own sleeve, to reveal an identical tattoo.

ARDETH BEY
A “Medjai*, like myself.

Alex leans forward from the back seat, very excited.
ALEX
Wow look at that! What’s a
Masonic Templar, Dad?

O'CONNELL ~
It’s an ancient secret society, Alex.
ARDETH BEY
Dedicated to the Brotherhood of Man.
Under the all seeing eye of God.

Alex turns to Jonathan, very excited.

ALEX
My dad’s an ancient warrior!
 

Jonathan pokes at O’Connell’s tattoo.

JONATHAN
What’s a job like that pay?

O'Connell SWATS Jonathan’s hand away.

O'CONNELL
I am not a Templar. Some joker
slapped this tattoo on me when
I was put in the orphanage in
Hong Kong.

ARDETH BEY
It is not a tattoo, but a precise
brand, there is only one print
of it in all the world. It would
only have been given to a Medjai
father to place on his son.

O’ CONNELL
All I remember, is that it hurt
like hell.

ALEX
When you‘re a Templar, whaddaya
get to do?

ARDETH BEY
Your fate is to be a Protector of
Man, your destiny, to fight evil,
always.

O'Connell looks dubious.

O’CONNELL
Sounds great.

ARDETH BEY
It is in the blood, passed down
from generation to generation,
from father to son.

Alex looks elated.

ALEX
Sounds really great! That means
</m gonna get a tattoo!

0’ CONNELL
You are got going to get a tattoo.

XT. BRITISH MUSEUM — NIGHT

The Rolls skids to a stop in front of the BRITISH MUSEUM.
It’s late, and there’s not a soul in sight. THUNDER RUMBLES.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE — NIGHT
Ardeth Bey turns to Alex in the back seat, smiling kindly.

ARDETH BEY
To earn your brand, you must
perform a feat which is both
brave and wise.

O’Connell plays along.

O'CONNELL
That's right, Alex, so I want you
to stay here and protect the car.

Jonathan quickly raises his hand.

JONATHAN
I could do that.

Alex gives his Dad a very sarcastic look.

ALEX
“Protect” the car. C’mon Dad,
just because I’m eight, doesn’t
mean I’m stupid.

O'Connell grins and ruffles his son's hair. Jonathan gives
Alex a forlorn look.

JONATHAN
If you see someone come running
out screaming, it’s just me.

0’ CONNELL
' Jonathan, maybe you should ‘stay
here with Alex.

JONATHAN
Now you’re thinking!
EXT. ROLLS ROYCE — NIGHT
O'Connell pops open the trunk. His GUNNYSACK lies inside.

He throws it open. Revealing pistols, a pump shotgun, a

submachine-gun, and other weaponry. O’Connell gives Ardeth
Bey a hard look.
36

O’CONNELL
My parents abandoned me.

ARDETH BEY
No Templar would ever abandon
his child. He must have been
killed, your father. He would
have gladly given his life for
you. As you would for your child.

This seems to give O’Connell strength. He slowly grins, then
reaches into the gunnysack with both hands and rips out the
shotgun and machine-gun. LIGHTNING FLASHES across his face.

O'CONNELL
Let‘s do it.

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM STORAGE WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

in the bowels of the museum is a huge storage area.
In the midst of all the giant crates and boxes, ancient ,
pillars and statuary, a sacred ceremony is being performed:
The High Priest, Lock-Nah and all their Men are now PAINTED :
GOLD and WEARING PRIESTLY GARB. TORCHES light the scene as
they CHANT in a circle around the horrific petrified rock.

Evy is groggy, but starting to wake. She sees her situation:
she’s lying on top of a sarcophagus lid with her hands and
feet tied together. Then she looks over and sees IMHOTEP’S
PETRIFIED CORPSE stuck in the rock. She can't believe it.

EVY
Imhotep.

INT. EGYPTIAN GALLERY — NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES through a skylight down onto O’Connell and
Ardeth Bey, guns up, quietly creeping through the Museumn’s
Egyptian Gallery. They can hear the distant CHANTING.

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM BASEMENT WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

Imhotep‘s petrified corpse suddenly SHUDDERS as the High
Priest reads from the black Book Of The Dead.

O’Connell and Ardeth Bey both SCREAM, whip their guns around
and back up against a glass case. Another mummy SLAPS it's
face up against. the glass behind them. O’Connell and Ardeth
Bey quickly back away as all the mummies in the room squirm
and writhe inside their cases, trying in vain to break out.

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM BASEMENT WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

The CHANTING and READING of the Book reaches a CRESCENDO.
LIGHTNING flashes across Imhotep’s petrified corpse, which
STARTS TO COME ALIVE. His petrified tissue begins to animate.
His tattered flesh and rotted bones begin to move.

The High Priest and Lock-Nah are thrilled. Evy is horrified.

Imhotep’s rotted corpse steps free of the rock. The Priests
STOP CHANTING and prostrate themselves before him. Imhotep
looks around with hideous empty eye sockets, they suddenly
fix onto something. Evy turns to see what it is.

It's Meela, striding down a corridor. THE SCREEN FLASHES. And
Meela is now striding through Pharaoh's palace wearing little
but paint from head to toe, --gshe's really ANCK-SUNBMUN.

Anck steps up to IMHOTEP, who looks more muscular and
handsome than ever. He looks into her luscious eyes.

IMHOTEP
Anck-sunamun.

THE SCREEN FLASHES. And Meela is standing in front of
Imhotep’s living corpse. The High Priest looks at her.

HIGH PRIEST
Do not be frightened.

Meela stares at Imhotep, a stone cold ice queen.

MEELA
I am not afraid. I am the direct
descendant of the goddess Isis.
I am the thirteenth daughter of
the thirteenth daughter.
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
I am Anck-sunamun reincarnated.

Imhotep stares back at her.
IMHOTEP

Only in body. But soon--

Imhotep’s fetid lips and rotted cheeks almost form a smile.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
I shall. bring your mind and soul
back from the depths of the underworld.

UP ON A CATWALK: O’Connell and Ardeth Bey stare down on this
surreal tableau. O’Connell just shakes his head.

O* CONNELL
Ya know, a few years ago I
woulda been a little wigged
out by all of this.

DOWN BELOW: Lock-Nah pours a VIAL OF ACID into the keyhole of
the Scorpion King chest. The metal SMOKES as the acid burns
through it. The High Priest steps up to Lock-Nah and grins.

HIGH PRIEST
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.

Lock-Nah pulls open the chest. But only the VASE is inside.
The High Priest’s face goes ashen.

HIGH PRIEST
Where is it? Where is the bracelet!?
(he looks at Evy)
The O’Connell woman!

LOCK~-NAH
No! She does not have it.

PUSH IN: on Lock-Nah, as his face slowly hardens.

LOCK-NAH
But I think I know who does.

EXT. STREET — NIGHT
TIGHT ON: ALEX, standing outside the car.
ALEX
~and at the very top of the gold

It was so. big it would reflect the

beckoning them to their deaths.

Meela leans in. closer. to Imhotep.

MEELA
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
I have a gift for you, my love.

She gestures. Imhotep looks. His face flashes hatred.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Her!

LIGHTNING FLASHES across Evy, struggling on the sarcophagus
lid, she sees them looking at her. Meela grins, cat-like.

MEELA
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Yes. I knew it would please you to
watch her die.

Meela snaps her fingers. A group of Priests lift the lid. Evy
struggles on top of it, then she notices they’re carrying her
to an open sarcophagus FILLED WITH WRIGGLING SCARABS.

EVY
Oh my god.

Imhotep‘s fetid lips grin at Evy as she’s carried past hin.
IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
The underworld awaits you.
Evy is carried up to the sarcophagus. She YELLS at Imhotep.
wai 11 me
You +1 1°11 put you in y
grave agsini :
The High Priest steps up and gives Evy a creepy grin.
" ‘HIGH PRIEST
Our thinking was: not if we
put you in your grave first.
Evy looks down at the squirming scarabs. Imhotep YELLS:
IMHOTEP

(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Kill hert
 

Meela grins in delight. THUNDER CRACKS. The Priests TILT THE
LID towards the sarcophagus. Evy SCREAMS and ROLLS OFF.

O'Connell leaps forward and catches her. LIGHTNING FLASHES.
And that’s when Ardeth Bey OPENS FIRE from up in the catwalk.
The High Priest, Lock-Nah and all the Priests dive for cover.
The sarcophagus lid CRASHES to the floor. Bullets rip into
the pillar above Meela’s head, she SCREAMS and hits the deck.

EXT. ROLLS ROYCE — NIGHT i

Standing outside the Rolls Royce, Jonathan and Alex hear the
GUNFIRE. They both attack the door handle, fighting over it.

The front door opens and they both leap inside.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE — NIGHT

Jonathan jams the key into the ignition and frantically turns
it, the key BREAKS OFF in the ignition. Alex SCREAMS at him.

ALEX '
You broke it! You broke it!

JONATHAN '
Be quiet, Alex! If there’s going to
be any hysterics, they’11 come from ME!

INT. BRITISH MUSEUM BASEMENT WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

Ardeth Bey races across the catwalk, BLASTING AWAY, keeping
everybody pinned down. O'Connell uses one hand to snap open a
butterfly knife and cut the ropes holding Evy, at the same
time, his other hand is pumping shotgun BLASTS. One of which
blows a Priest backwards into another Priest, who falls into
the scarab filled sarcophagus..The Priest SCREAMS and FLAILS
WILDLY as the hideous flesh eating scarabs ENVELOP HIM.

Imhotep steps up to the BLACK URN where his “servants” are
kept. Bullets RIP THROUGH HIM. He doesn’t seem to mind.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Rise ye my servants!

O'Connell and Evy start racing up a staircase.

Imhotep continues his chant over the urn.

IMHOTEP
{ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Collect your bones, gather your
limbs, shake the earth from your
flesh! Your Master is here!

Imhotep RIPS the lid off the black urn, --A MASS OF SAND
EXPLODES OUT OF IT and FORMS INTO FOUR SOLDIER MUMMIES.
O’Connell, Evy and Ardeth Bey meet at the top of the
staircase, they look down and see the Soldier Mummies.

O’ CONNELL
Not these guys again.

Imhotep points to our heroes, then looks at the Soldier
Mummies and utters those famous words:

IMHOTEP
E-heeby-uut Set-na!

O'Connell yanks Evy out the door. Ardeth Bey is right behind.
The Soldier Mummies hunker into attack position and SCREECH.

EXT. ROLLS ROYCE - NIGHT

Jonathan and Alex scramble out of the car. They hear the
distant SOUND of the Soldier Mummies SCREECHING INSANELY.
Jonathan grabs Alex tightly, panicking.

JONATHAN
What are we going to do!? What
are we going to do?!

ALEX
You’re asking ME??! I’m only
eight years old for cripes sake!

EXT. MUSEUM ALLEY — NIGHT

The side door of the museum BURSTS OPEN. O’Connell, Evy and
Ardeth Bey run out. They race down the alley. Behind them,
the brick wall of the museum EXPLODES as the four Soldier
Mummies jump through it in perfect unison, hit the pavement,
pivot sharply, and stride down the alley after then.

EXT. STREET — NIGHT

O'Connell, Evy and Ardeth Bey race out into the deserted
street and up to the empty Rolls Royce.

O'CONNELL
Where the hell’s Jonathan?
42

A BRIGHT RED DOUBLE-DECKER BUS careens around the corner.
Jonathan at the wheel, nervously trying to maintain control.
The bus slows. Alex-pulls open the door. O’Connell, Evy and
Ardeth Bey leap inside. Evy hugs Alex. O’Connell gives
Jonathan a look-to-kill.

O'CONNELL
What's the matter with my car?
JONATHAN
We were forced to find alternative
transportation.
O'Connell is incredulous.

O'CONNELL
A double~decker bus!?

Jonathan points to Alex.

It was his ideal

ALEX
Was not!

JONATHAN
Was too!

ALEX
Was not!

JONATHAN
Was too!

O'CONNELL
Goll!

Jonathan HITS THE GAS and SHIFTS UP. The bus lurches forward.
O'Connell runs to the back of the bus and locks out. He sees
the four Soldier Mummies stride out of the alley, two-by~two
assault formation. They pivot and march right up and over his
Rolls Royce. Severely CRUSHING the trunk, roof and bonnet.
O’Connell is devastated.

O'CONNELL
I hate mummies.

The Soldier Mummies fan out, four abreast, and begin to
accelerate after the bus. O’Connell looks at Ardeth Bey.
O'CONNELL
You take the low road. I’1l
take the high.

ARDETH BEY
Right.
O'Connell heads for the staircase.
O'CONNELL

There's nothin’ better than
shooting mummies.

He sees his son looking at him.

O'CONNELL
Except reading, writing and arithmetic.

Alex just roll his eyes. O’Connell heads up the stairs.
Ardeth Bey hefts his machine-gun. Aims it at the back window.

EXT. TOP OF BUS ~- NIGHT

Q’Connell comes up onto the TOP DECK of the bus. Sees the ,
Soldier Mummies CHARGING after him. And gaining quickly.

Okay, here we go, everything happens at once, READ FAST:

OQ’Connell starts pumping SHOTGUN BLASTS down at the Soldier
Mummies. Blows out several ribcages. All four Soldier Mummies
instantly fan out and RUN UP THE SIDES OF THE BUILDINGS,
running herizontal to the street, two on either side.

. O* CONNELL
Right.
INT. BUS — NIGHT

One of the Soldier Mummies LEAPS off the building and
plasters himself to the back window of the bus, --WHAM!
Scares the shit out of Ardeth Bey. He OPENS FIRE. Blasts the
window. SHATTER CITY. The Soldier Mummy is RIPPED IN HALF.
The lower half of it’s body drops away and hits the street.

EXT. TOP OF BUS — NIGHT

Another Soldier Mummy LEAPS off a building at O’Connell.
O'Connell FIRES. Blows it out of the air. He feele something
coming and pivots, --too late. Another Soldier Mummy FLIES
through the air and TACKLES him. They both SLAM to the deck.
O'Connell's shotgun skitters off down the aisle. READ FASTER:
INT. BUS — NIGHT

Ardeth Bey pops the cartridge out of his machine-gun,

it drops to the floor, he fumbles for another one. Suddenly,
the torso of the Soldier Mummy he just shot in half SWINGS in
through the shattered rear window, SCREAMING in rage. Ardeth
Bey starts backpedaling up the aisle, trying to reload.

EXT. BUS — NIGHT

The Soldier Mummy up top grabs O’Connell’s throat, lifts him
to his feet and starts STRANGLING HIM.

INT. BUS — NIGHT

Ardeth Bey backpedals up the aisle, having trouble reloading.
The half-Soldier Mummy chases him, scurrying over the seats
using only it’s hands, like a crazed monkey, SCREECHING
WILDLY. Evy and Alex see it coming, they YELL at Jonathan.

EVY/ALEX
TURN! TURN! TURN!

Jonathan CRANKS THE WHEEL.
EXT. BUS - NIGHT

The bus SLEWS HARD TO THE LEFT. Up top, O’Connell and the
Soldier Mummy strangling him are THROWN across the aisle.

INT. BUS — NIGHT

So is Ardeth Bey and the half-Soldier Mummy. Ardeth Bey’s gun
goes flying out the window. The bus ROARS into Hyde Park.

EXT. BUS/HYDE PARK — NIGHT

O'Connell quickly crawls on his hands and knees as fast as he
can down the aisle towards his shotgun.

INT. BUS — NIGHT

Ardeth Bey leaps to his feet, unarmed. The half-Soldier Mummy
rises up over a seat in front of him and lifts it’s deformed
hand, --RAZOR SHARP, FOUR INCH FINGERNAILS GROW out of it’s
fingertips. It SWIPES at Ardeth Bey. RIPS into his arm.
Ardeth Bey SCREAMS and falls back. Evy and Alex grab him.

EXT. BUS — NIGHT

O’Connell’s fingertips grab the butt of the shotgun. He’s
almost got a grip on it.
45

INT. BUS — NIGHT
The half-Soldier Mummy SCREECHES and leaps forward.

EVY/ALEX
TURN! TURN! TURN!

Jonathan CRANKS THE WHEEL.
EXT. BUS — NIGHT

The bus SLEWS HARD TO THE RIGHT. O’Connell’s shotgun goes
skittering away from him. His eyes widen as he sees it tumble
down into the stairwell. They get even wider as the Soldier
Mummy behind him grabs his ankle and LIFTS HIM UP.

INT. BUS — NIGHT

The half-Soldier Mummy SWIPES at Ardeth Bey again. RIPS him
across the chest. Ardeth Bey slams into the wall of the bus,
dazed and hurt. The half-Mummy closes in for the kill.

Evy hears something to her right, she looks: it’s O’Connell’s
shotgun tumbling down the stairs. Evy grabs it. Pumps it.

The half-Mummy lifts Ardeth Bey up with one hand while
drawing his hideous clawfingers back for the final blow.
Evy spins around and pulls the trigger, --BLAM! Point blank.
Blows the half-Mummy to pieces.

Jonathan and Alex are staring out through the front
windshield. Eyes widening in unison.

JONATHAN/ALEX
UB=OH.

Up ahead, is a very low hanging pedestrain BRIDGE.
JONATHAN/ALEX

(in unison)
We‘re not gonna make itl

"EXT. BUS — NIGHT

Up top, O’Connell is trying to fight off the Soldier Mummy as
it viciously strangles him. Then he sees something over the
Soldier Mummy's shoulder. O’Connell's eyes widen. He throws a
wild punch, knocks himself free. Hits the deck and covers his
head. The Soldier Mummy looks down at him, then quickly turns
to see what's coming. =-It’s the bridge.

The bottom two-thirds of the bus goes under the bridge. The
top third is RIPPED CLEAN OFF, taking the Soldier Mummy right
along with it.
a

BACK UP ON TOP OF THE BUS: O’Connell cautiously opens his
eyes, --there’s nothing but torn metal all around him.
The bus races out onto Tower Bridge.

INT. BUS — NIGHT
Alex throws his arms around Jonathan.

ALEX
Great driving Uncle Jon!

Jonathan hugs Alex with his free arm; we see how close they
are. A moment of calm. And then Alex hears something to his
immediate right. He turns and looks, --A SOLDIER MUMMY POPS
UP INTO THE OPEN WINDOW, clinging to the side of the bus.
Alex SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS. The Soldier Mummy SCREAMS!

And then the barrel of a shotgun whips into FRAME over Alex's
shoulder and right into the Soldier Mummy’s mouth.

O'CONNELL
Close your eyes, Alex.

Alex scrunches his eyes shut. O’Connell pulls the trigger.
The Soldier Mummy's head is BLOWN OFF.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE — NIGHT

The headless Mummy’s body FLIES off the bus and out over
Tower Bridge.

INT. BUS — NIGHT

Jonathan starts to shift down. Coming from the engine is a
SOUND like nails being dropped into a blender. This bus is
a write-off. O'Connell looks at Ardeth Bey.

O'CONNELL
You alright?

Ardeth Bey winces painfully.

ARDETH BEY
I prefer the company of camels.

O'Connell gives Evy a hangdog grin. She gives him a sexy
smile, then lifts a finger and curls it, gesturing for him
to come hither. He does. She grabs him. They KISS gently.
Jonathan and Alex both roll their eyes in disgust.

JONATHAN/ALEX
Oh pu-leeeeze.
o

Alex walks off down the aisle, shaking his head.

' The bus slowly CLATTERS to a stop. O’Connell and Evy unlock

and leok into each other's eyes. O’Connell SIGHS HEAVILY.

O'CONNELL
Are all librarian’s this much
trouble?

They both smile. And that’s when they hear Alex YELLING. They
turn and see him being pulled out a back window by Lock-Nah.
Evy SCREAMS.
EVY
ALEX}!

O'Connell practically throws himself down the aisle. He makes
it to the window in time to see Alex struggling with Lock-Nah
and several red turbaned men on top of a flatbed truck, which
WHIPS AROUND and CHARGES back out onto the bridge.

EXT. BUS — NIGHT

O'Connell comes tearing out of the bus with Evy and Jonathan
right on his tail. He races after the truck. But the Tower’s
drawbridge STARTS TO RISE UP in front of him, cutting him
off. The truck CAREENS off the far end of bridge and vanishes
up an alley. O’Connell staggers to a stop, looking like a guy
who's just had his heart ripped out.

O'CONNELL
Alex.

EXT. BRITISH MUSEUM PARAPET — NIGHT

Imhotep stands on the uppermost parapet of the British
Museum, surrounded by moldy copper gargoyles.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Now I shall go to Ahm Shere
and kill the Scorpion King.

He turns to Meela, who is looking sexy as hell.
IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
And we shall rule the world together.

Meela smiles. In the background, the High Priest nervously
urges her on.

HIGH PRIEST
Tell him. —Tell him!

 
Meela stays him with a glance, then looks at Imhotep and
steels herself.

MEELA
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
My love, we do not have the
Scepter of Osiris.

Imhotep looks at her, and then just smiles.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
I do not need the Scepter of Osiris.

His face hardens in anger and he gives her a bitter smile.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
When they cursed me, they made
me stronger than their gods!

Then he leans in to kiss her. His ugly corpse face frightens
her. She starts to lean back. THE SCREEN FLASHES. They are
now face-to-face in Pharaoh's palace. Handsome Imhotep and
beautiful Anck-su-namum. Anck looks around, surprised to be
there. Imhotep continues to lean in for his kiss. Anck grins
at the handsome man, then kisses him hard and closes her
eyes. THE SCREEN FLASHES. Imhotep’s rotted face and fetid
lips are now kissing Meela’s smooth skin and full lips.

It's a good thing her eyes are closed. Imhotep's face

ROTS AWAY just a little bit more.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE — NIGHT

O’Connell and Evy stare out over the Thames to where the
truck vanished, looking stricken. Ardeth Bey steps up.

ARDETH BEY
Do not fear, my friends. They
will not hurt your son.
O'Connell and Evy turn and look at him.
ARDETH BEY
They can not hurt him. For he
wears the bracelet of Anubis.
Evy looks at O’Connell.

Evy
Alex is wearing the bracelet?

O'Connell just wants answers, he steps towards Ardeth Bey.

 
 

—:

O’CONNELL
Alex said he saw Giza, and then
Rarnac...?

ARDETH BEY

When they reach Karnac, the
bracelet will show him the next
step on the journey, and continue
to do so until they reach Ahm Shere.

O'CONNELL
Then we better get to Karnac, pronto.

Jonathan looks devastated.
JONATHAN
Don’t tell me I’ve got to go
back to the desert.

O'Connell, Evy and Ardeth Bey all turn and glare at him.
Jonathan quickly shifts gears and smiles brightly.

JONATHAN
Hey! We're going back to Egypt!

O'Connell grits his teeth and pumps his shotgun, KA-CHANK!

O*CONNELL

iwant my son back.
EXT. CAIRO TRAIN STATION (MATTE) — DAY
A TRAIN is pulling out of CAIRO STATION. The FIFTY ARMED MEN
in black turbans sit on top of each car. In the background,
are the pyramids and the Sphinx of the Giza Plateau.
INT. LUXURY CAR ~ DAY
Lock-Nah pulls Alex into a luxury parlor car. Alex sees the
High Priest hand Meela the black BOOK OF THE DEAD. Alex
points to it, very impressed.

ALEX
Hey! The Book of the Dead.

Lock-Nah slaps his hand down as Meela and the High Priest
turn to face then.

MEELA
What a bright little child.
She licks her fingers and straightens his hair, very
motherly.

MEELA
Your mother must be missing
you terribly. If you wish to
see her again, you best behave.

ALEX
Lady, I don’t behave for my
parents, what makes you think
I’m gonna do it for yoy?

MEELA
Because your parents wouldn’t
slip poisonous snakes into your
bed while you were sleeping.

She smiles. Alex’s eyes widen. The High Priest looks at Lock-
Nah.

HIGH PRIEST
Lord Imhotep wishes to meet the boy.

Lock-Nah nods, then YANKS Alex out the back door. There is a
knock on the front door as it opens and Red and Spivey step
inside, followed by Abdul and Muhammed, carrying a “box”
shrouded in a blanket. The High Priest stares at them.

HIGH PRIEST
Did you acquire what we asked?

RED
Oh, we “acquired it” all right.
‘ad to kill two a them guards
at the museum to acquire it.

Abdul pulls the shroud off the “box”, --it’s the SAME EXACT
CHEST the Americans found and opened in the first movie.
Abdul angrily fingers the hieroglyphs on it’s lid.

ABDUL
This chest is cursed. It says
there is one, the undead, who
will kill all those who open
this chest--

HIGH PRIEST
(dismissing him)
--Yes, yes, and suck them dry
and then he’1l become whole again.
We've all heard the story before.

 

 
Si

RED
I ‘erd the American chaps who
found it nine years ago all died,
‘orrible deaths they were.

Spivey gives them a grin.

SPIVEY
So we want five thousand.

Lock-Nah is furious.

LOCK-NAH
The deal was for two!

‘BPIVEY
We want five or we’ll sell
it elsewhere.

Lock-Nah reaches for his scimitar. Meela stops him.

MEELA
Five will be just fine.
She turns and heads for the back door.

MEELA
Follow me, gentlemen, and you
Shall receive all that you deserve.

INT. CLUTTERED BOXCAR — DAY

The interior of this boxcar has been transformed into an
ancient Egyptian temple. Lit by TORCHES. Incense burns. Very
moody. The rear door opens. Alex is hustled in by Lock-Nah,
who closes the door and escorts Alex up to a hooded FIGURE.
Lock-Nah bows down. The Figure turns around. Alex SCREAMS.
It’s Imhotep, looking incredibly creepy and gross.

PUSH IN: on Imhotep as he begins speaking ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.
PULL OUT: as his ANCIENT EGYPTIAN morphs into ENGLISH:

IMHOTEP
Keetash issirian ibn it is you
who are the chosen one, you who
will take me to Ahm Shere.

Alex blinks, then shakes his head, a bit disconcerted. Then
he stops himself from trembling and tries to be brave.

ALEX
What if I don’t? What if I get
a little, —lost?

 
 

Imhotep’s sinewy face forms a horrific semi-smile.

IMHOTEP
You have strength little one,
you are your father’s son.

Lock-Nah is staring at Alex and Imhotep, to him, they are
BOTH i

IMHOTEP
But I know something you don’t.

Imhotep grabs the bracelet on Alex’s wrist. Alex is
terrified.

IMHOTEP
This bracelet is a gift anda
curse. The sands of time have
already begun to pour against you.

Imhotep reaches over and flips a large HOURGLASS filled with
black sand. The sand begins to pour.

IMHOTEP
From the moment the bracelet
takes hold of your wrist, seven
days do you have to enter the
pyramid of Ahm Shere, and then..

Imhotep stares at the bracelet. Alex stares at Imhotep.

ALEX
Yeah? AND THEN?!

Imhotep looks him square in the eyes.
IMHOTEP
And then it will suck the life
out of you.

ALEX
Wait a minute, that’s in five days!

IMHOTEP
Then I think it would be best if
we did not become lost.
Alex slowly grits his teeth and gives Imhotep a hard stare.

ALEX
My dad is’ gonna kick your ass.
 

VOICES are heard coming from outside. Imhotep spins around
and heads back to the altar. Lock-Nah quickly grabs Alex and
pulls him out the front door. Meela enters through the rear
door, ushering Red, Spivey, Abdul, and Muhammed inside.

MEELA
In here, gentlemen, you shall
receive your just rewards.

RED
No tricks now, woman, we’re
not givin’ up this ‘ere chest
‘till we're satisfied.

Meela gives him a very seductive look.

MEELA
There is much satisfaction to be had.

Abdul and Muhammed carry the chest into the gloomy cabin.
Meela quickly sweeps out behind all of them and shuts the
door, LOCKING IT from the outside. Spivey looks spooked.

SPIVEY
What the ‘ell?

Red and Abdul squint into the smoky car. They can just barely
make out a large shadow. Red draws his pistol.

RED
Wha’ do we ‘av ‘ere then?

Imhotep steps into a SHAFT OF LIGHT and SHRIEKS. Red, Spivey,
Abdul, and Muhammed just about jump out of their skin. Spivey
and Muhammed start to SCREAM and PANIC and CLAW at the back
door. The metal plate covering the peep hole slides back,
revealing Meela'’s beautiful face.

MEELA
He wants you to open the chest!
Quick! Open the chest!

The peep hole slams shut. Spivey goes for it. Abdul YELLS:

ABDUL
NoOOO!

But Spivey grabs the lid-to the chest and pulls, --it POPS
OPEN WITH A LOUD HISS AND A BLAST OF WHITE VAPOR. Imhotep’s
mouth starts to open wide, AND KEEPS OPENING, until his mouth
is about the size of an oil drum. Then he LUNGES FORWARD and
SUCKS MUHAMMAD INTO HIS MOUTH. He immediately SPITS HIM OUT.
Muhammad’s SHRIVELLED CORPSE slams off a wall and drops to
the floor. Now even Red and Abdul freak out.
a

Imhotep starts stalking them. He SUCKS Spivey into his mouth.
SPITS HIM OUT. Spivey’s shrivelled corpse STICKS to the wall.
Red and Abdul start FIRING their revolvers.

INT. PARLOR CAR — DAY

The High Priest hears the TWO GUNS FIRING and looks up from
the book he’s reading. Meela enters and sits across from him.

MEELA
Nothing to worry about.

Now only ONE GUN FIRES. ~And then all goes quiet. She smiles.

MEELA
Nothing to worry about at all.

INT. CLUTTERED BOXCAR — DAY

Imhotep steps out of the shadows, now FULLY REGENERATED,
leoking more muscular and handsome than ever. And he seems
quite pleased with himself.

EXT. IZZY’S HANGAR — DAY

Jonathan’s Dussenberg trundles across the desert and up to a
beat-to-shit AIRPORT HANGAR. A SIGN READS:

MAGIC CARPET AIRWAYS

O’Connell, Evy and Jonathan get out of the car. The hangar
door opens. A wiid-haired MECHANIC covered in grease steps
out. This is IZZY. He takes one lcok at O’Connell and
immediately runs back inside, SLAMS the door and LOCKS IT.
Evy gives O'Connell a look.

EVY
I see you’ve met.

O'CONNELL

Jonathan, get our bags, I’ll
deal with this guy.

Jonathan lifts up the Scepter of Osiris.

JONATHAN
My hands are pretty full—

~--0’Connell snatches it away.

O'CONNELL
Now.
55

JONATHAN
Right, right, I'll get the bags.

Jonathan scurries away. ‘Connell walks up to the hangar
door, pulls his gun and SHOOTS OFF the doorhandle. Evy gives
him another look.

EVELYN
Honey, you’re not a subtie man.

O'Connell holsters his gun.

Q’CONNELL
Don't have time for subtle.

He KICKS the door open, then courteously waves Evy in.
INT. IZZY’S HANGAR - DAY

Izzy is very upset, pacing and RANTING:

rzZzy
Forget it, O’Connell! Every time
I hook up with you I get my butt
shot off. Look! See! I hardly got
any butt left at all. Remember
that bank job in Marrakesh?

Evy looks at O’Connell and raises an eyebrow.

Evy
Bank job?

O'Connell lamely tries to cover.

O'CONNELL
It’s not like it sounds. Really.

Izzy looks at Evy.

IZ2Y
I fly in low for the pick up, land
on a friggin’ dime, next thing ya
know, I’m lyin’ in the middle of
the road, all shot up! My spleen
hangin’ out--!

Evy cringes. Izzy gestures to O'Connell.
Izzy

--and I see bim waltzin' off
with some bellydancer girl!
 

Evy cocks an eyebrow at O’Connell.

EVY
Bellydancer girl?

Then she looks back at Izzy.

EVY
Clearly, you and I need to
get better acquainted.

O'Connell slams a large bundle of cash onto the table, trying
to change the subject.

O’CONNELL
We don’t care what it costs.

TZzy
O'Connell, you looked around
here any? What do I need money
for? What the hell am I gonna
spend it on!?

O'Connell punctuates his dialogue by pointing the Scepter at
Izzy:

O’CONNELL
Look Izzy, my little boy is out
there and I’m gonna do whatever
it takes to get him back.

O'Connell notices that Izzy has been staring at the Scepter.
He moves the Scepter to the left. Izzy's eyes follow it. He
points it to the right. Izzy’s eyes are locked on. Up. Down.
Izzy’s head comically moves with the Scepter. O’Connell
smiles knowingly. Izzy finally points to the Scepter.

IZZY
O’Connell, you gimme that gold
thing there, you can set me on
fire and call me names.

O’Connell hands Izzy the Scepter. Izzy grabs it. O’Connell
doesn’t let go of it.

O'CONNELL
The men we're up against wanted
this thing awful bad. Bring it along.

IZZY
You think I'd leave it here?
co

O'Connell lets go. Izzy gleefully scurries away.
Jonathan staggers up and drops the luggage.

JONATHAN
Hey, where's my gold stick?

O’Connell looks at him.

O'CONNELL
Don’t worry, we did the right thing.

JONATHAN
We did?

EXT. HANGAR — DAY

O'Connell and Jonathan step out of the hangar, followed by
Izzy, wiping his greasy hands across his dirty yellow shirt,
and giving Evy a flirty, rotten toothed smile.

TZ2zy
~you're not exactly catching
me at my best.

And then he spots Ardeth Bey and TWELVE MEDJAI WARRIORS
sitting on horses. He stops in his tracks, suddenly nervous.

IZZY
And uh, who, exactly, are
these friendly looking fellows?

Ardeth Bey dismounts.

ARDETH BEY
They are the commanders of the
twelve tribes of the Medjai.
(he lifts his arm)
Horus !

A FALCON on the arm of one of the Medjai Commanders flies off
and over to Ardeth Bey, landing on his outstretched arm.
Jonathan looks at Ardeth Bey and grins.

JONATHAN
Pet bird?

Ardeth Bey lovingly strokes Horus’ feathers.

ARDETH BEY
My best and most clever friend.
He will let the other commanders
know-of our progress, so that
they may follow.
Ardeth Bey looks at the other Commanders, then with an open
. palm he touches his heart and waves it towards the sun.

“ ARDETH BEY
Harum bara shad!

The Commanders make the same sign and CALL BACK:

COMMANDERS
Harum bara shad!

Then they rear their horses around and gallop off.

ARDETH BEY
If the Army of Anubis arises,
they will do all they can to |
stop them.

EXT. HANGAR - DAY

O'Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey round the side of the :
hangar. They come to a dead stop as they look up and see: '

A small golden DIRIGIBLE, a blimp, floating in the air, held
down by mooring lines. Slung to its underbelly is a decrepit
Old FISHING TRAWLER. An airplane propeller sticks out of the
rear of the boat engine. It all looks very hand-made and
ss jerry-rigged. Izzy stands in front of it, grinning proudly.

IZZY
Isn’t she beautiful!

O’Connell looks very annoyed.

O'CONNELL
It’s a balioon.

IZZY
It’s a dizrigible!
O'CONNELL
Where‘s your airplane?
Izzy
Airplanes are a thing of the past.
O'Connell does a slow burn as Ardeth Bey shakes his head.

ARDETH BEY

Why can’t you people ever keep
your feet on the ground?
O’Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey follow Izzy up the
gangway. There are multiple BANNERS slung along the side of
the boat covered in NAMES WRITTEN IN ARABIC.

JONATHAN
Why are there names written all
over it?
IZZY
(proudly) |
That was my idea.
EVY
Your idea?
Izzy

Yeah, ya see, I talked all the

local merchants into payin’ me

to put their names on it.
(smiles broadly}

I call it: “Product Placement”.

Izzy cuts the mooring lines. The blimp BEGINS TO ASCEND.

CUT WIDE: as the blimp motors off into the desert towards a
gorgeous SETTING SUN. DISSOLVE TO: a fantastic FULL MOON, as
the blimp floats across it. A billion stars twinkle brightly.

EXT. BLIMP - NIGHT

Jonathan and Ardeth Bey are sitting alongside the cabin.
Jonathan's arm is reaching into a porthole, scrounging around
inside for something. ardeth Bey is lovingly petting Horus.

ARDETH BEY
It is written, that the Oasis
of Ahm Shere is where Man began,
and where his demise will originate.

JONATHAN
Yes, yes, sounds terrible, now
about that gold pyramid?

ARDETH BEY ©
(ominously)
It is written, that since the time
of the Scorpion King, no man who
has ever laid eyes upon it, has
ever returned to tell the tale.

Jonathan looks nervous.

JONATHAN
Where is all this stuff written?

 
Then he pulls the Scepter out through the porthole.

JONATHAN
There! Got it. Pretty nice eh?

ARDETH BEY
Yes, and it must be very important,
if I were you, I would keep it close.

Jonathan proudly puffs up his chest.

JONATHAN
The gods couldn’t take it away.

Izzy walks past and snatches it out of Jonathan’s hand.

Izzy
That's mine, skinny boy, keep
ya hands off.

Jonathan looks crestfallen. Ardeth Bey just laughs.

UP AT THE BOW: O'Connell steps up to Evy, who is staring out
at the fantastic landscapes below. She starts to tremble.

EVELYN
I want him back, Rick. I want
him in my arms.

Evy starts to cry. O’Connell gently wraps his arms around her
and hugs her tight.

O'CONNELL
I know.., I know...

He sees the GOLD DISC in her hands and points to an engraving
of some Anubis Warriors, trying to get her mind off of Alex.

O’ CONNELL
So who are these guys?
EVELYN

Anubis Warriors. Minions of
the Scorpion King.

O’CONNELL
And these little guys here?

Evy looks into his eyes and gives him a slight smile, she
knows what he’s trying to do, and she loves him for it.
 

EVELYN
Pygmies. The Pharaohs used to
catch them and bring them back
to Thebes for show. They were
cannibals. And yery ill tempered.

O'CONNELL
So whatever happened to this
Scorpion King guy?

EVELYN
He betrayed Anubis and was
condemned for all time. His
curse was so horrible, it
has never been described.

Evy’s eyes drift off. O’Connell hugs her tighter.
O’CONNELL
-~I promise, Evy, we're gonna
get him back.
EXT. TRAIN — DAY

The SUN RISES behind the train as it races between giant
golden sand dunes.

INT. TRAIN - PRIVATE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY
A tight little passenger compartment. Alex drums his fingers

on the windowsill and stares at Lock-Nah, who sits across
from him and stares right back.

ALEX
Are we there yet?

LOCK-NAH
No.

ALEX
Are we there yet?

LOCK-NAH
No.

ALEX
Are we there yet?

LOCK-NAH
No.

ALEX

Are we there yet?

61
Lock-Nah leaps up and SLAMS a knifeblade down between two of
Alex‘s fingers, missing them by a hair. Alex just stares.

ALEX
Wow, that was amazing, perfect aim.

LOCK-NAH
What are you talking about?

Lock-Nah yanks the knife out.

LOCK-NAH
imissed.

Alex's eyes widen. Lock-Nah starts picking his teeth with the
blade. Alex glares at him.

ALEX
I have to go to the bathroom.

INT. TRAIN BATHROOM — DAY
The bathroom door opens and Alex looks into the most rancid,
filthy, disgusting, windowless craphole imaginable. He looks
up at Lock-Nah, and in a very dainty voice says:
ALEX
Where’s the bidet?
LOCK-NAH
HURRY UP!
ALEX
Just kidding, geez.
Lock-Nah crosses his arms and stares down at Alex. Alex

stares right back up at him.

ALEX
I can’t go when someone’s watching.

Lock-Nah snarls, then steps out and siams the door. Alex
looks around, disgusted and dejected, then he looks down
into the “toilet”.

ALEX
Yikes. Doesn't anyone around here
know how to flush a toilet?

He gingerly grabs the rusty chain and pulls. There is a loud
FLUSHING SOUND..And-then Alex’s eyes widen.
The bottom of the toilet has OPENED and is spilling
rinsewater right onto the train tracks. Alex quickly grabs
the rusty toilet and pulls, peeling it back to reveal a HOLE
big enough for him to fit through. The tracks WHIZ2 past.

EXT. TRAIN — KARNAC — DAY

The brakes on the train suddenly LOCK-UP. The train starts
to SCREECH to a stop near the huge TEMPLE AT KARNAC. Men
SHOUT in ARABIC and broken English. Something about “the boy
has escaped!”. Several men on top of the train OPEN FIRE.

Imhotep‘s boxcar doors CRASH OPEN. Imhotep stands in the
doorway. He sees Alex, scurrying off through the ruins,
heading for the temple, bullets RICOCHETING all around him.
Imhotep angrily looks up at the two men firing above him. He
raises his arms. The two men are suddenly picked up off their
feet by an invisible force, lifted into the air, viciously
SLAMMED together, then flung like rag dolls into the ruins.

’

Alex vanishes into the temple complex.
Meela and the High Priest turn and glare at Lock-Nah, who
angrily lowers his head in shame.

NT. TEMPLE ROOM — DAY

Alex races into a temple room, panting from exhaustion.
Suddenly, the reom fills with a VISION: It’s the exterior of
KARNAC, only brand spanking new. Then the vision races across
the desert to the TEMPLE ISLAND OF PHILAE, circa 2,000 B.C..
A GIANT MAN suddenly comes striding across the island. The
vision vanishes. It’s Imhotep. He stops in front of Alex.
Alex is suddenly LEVITATED off his feet and brought up to eye
level with Imhotep. Imhotep’s face ROTS AWAY a tiny bit more.
He grins and wags a moldy finger at Alex.

IMHOTEP
Tch, tch, tch.

EXT. BLIMP — DAY

The blimp floats high over the Nile, backlit by another
gorgeous SUNSET. O’Connell and Ardeth Bey are busy locking
and loading, preparing for battle.

O* CONNELL
What kinda problems can we
expect from our old pal?

ARDETH BEY bu
Imhotep’s powers are weak it
he is still quite formidable.
Evy strolls up, looking very worried.

Evy
We had better get to Karnac
before they leave it, or we
won‘’t have the foggiest where
to go next.

O'Connell looks over at Izzy, sitting up in the cockpit.

O'CONNELL
IZZY!

IZZY
I already told ya!

O’CONNELL
fell me again.

IZzy
We'll be there before the
sun rises. Cross my heart.

O’Connell gives Evy a wink and a reassuring squeeze. Evy
forces a smile and heads for the bow of the boat. Suddenly,
her eyes start to glaze over and she goes into a trance.

NNT. KARNAC TEMPLE POOL — DAY

Imhotep is CHANTING over a tiny SACRED POOL covered in FOG.
Meela stares into it, her eyes glazing, going into a trance.
Imhotep stops chanting and turns to her.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
It is time to remind you of who
you are.

He passes his hand over the fog, it begins to part, revealing
not a pool, but a VISION OF ANCIENT EGYPT: PHARAOH’S PALACE.

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
And of who we are together.

The SCREEN FLASHES and we find ourselves in ancient times.
INT. PHARAOH'S PALACE — DAY

Two Egyptian Princesses, their faces hidden by ornate gold
MASKS, are engaged-in-hand-to-hand combat, these are the same

two Princesses depicted in the hieroglyphs at the beginning
of the movie. Imhotep and PHARAOH watch, greatly amused.
IMHOTEP (0.8.)
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled}
For our love is a true love, an
eternal love. Our souls mated forever.

Using small, hand-held TRIDENTS, the two gorgeous women

tly PUNCH, KICK, ELBOW and BACKHAND each other as they
brilliantly fight across the palace chamber. One of the
Princesses is viciously thrown to the floor, HER MASK IS
KNOCKED OFF, -~1ts EVY.

The other woman lunges forward, stopping her knife a quarter
inch before it plunges into Evy’s neck. The metal flaps on
the woman's mask SNAP OPEN, --revealing ANCK. The look in her
eyes tells us she’d like nothing better than to drive her
knife to the hilt. Evy gives the look right back at her,
clearly, there‘s no love lost between these two. Anck forces
herself to smile at Evy.

ANCK-SUNAMUN
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
You have improved greatly,
Princess Nefertiri.

Imhotep, Pharaoh and the surrounding COURTIERS applaud as the
two women get to their feet. Pharaoh steps forward.

PHARAOH
{ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Wonderful! Wonderful! Who
better to protect Pharaoh—
“(gestures to Evy/Nefertiri)
--than my lovely daughter,
(gestures to Anck)
And my future wife.

Pharaoh hugs Nefertiri. She lovingly hugs him back. And then,
over Pharaoh’s shoulder, she sees Anck and Imhotep exchange
knowing looks.

EXT. BLIMP - DAY

Evy’s eyes narrow suspiciously.

EXT. PHARAOH’S PALACE PARAPET — NIGHT

Nefertiri is strolling the parapet, enjoying the night air.
She looks across the palace courtyard and spies Anck coming

through some drapes and into a bedroom. Nefertiri scowls,
and then her eyes start to widen in surprise.
b

 

CUT TO FOOTAGE FROM THE FIRST MOVIE: Anck glides up to
Imhotep, standing in the bedroom. She passes her hand over
his face in her special way and they start to KISS.

Nefertiri looks away, furious, trying to decide what to do.
Then she looks back across the courtyard and sees Pharaoh
entering the bedroom. Anck now stands alone.

CUT TO FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE: Pharaoh strides up to Anck
and accuses her. Anck’s eyes flicker over his shoulder.
Pharaoh turns around. It’s Imhotep. He grabs Pharaoh’s sword.

Nefertiri starts to panic, she quickly looks around and spots
some Medjai bodyguards in the courtyard. She points to the
bedroom amd YELLS:

EVY/NEFERTIRI
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Quickly! My father needs you!

Nefertiri looks back across the courtyard in time to see:
FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE: Imhotep and Anck STABBING PHARAOH.

EXT. BLIMP — DAY
Evy lunges forward, SCREAMING in anguish.

O'Connell and the others turn and look just as Evy starts to
FALL OVER THE RAILING. O’Connelil LEAPS UP and DIVES for Evy,
he grabs her hand, --but is pulled right over the railing
along with her! At the last second his free hand grabs one of
the banners slung alongside the boat. --but the banners RIP
AWAY from the railing, SNAP-SNAP-SNAP! The last one finally
catches. Their descent JERKS TO A STOP.

Evy dangles from O’Connell’s outstretched arm, looking
shocked. There’s a half mile of dead air between them and the
earth below. O’Connell strains under the weight, fighting the
tug of gravity. He gives his wife an incredulous look.

O’ CONNELL
Going somewhere?

INT. KARNAC TEMPLE POOL —
Meela is still in a trance, staring into the pool, she YELLS:
MEELA/ANCK
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)

Go! Save yourself! Only you can
resurrect me!
INT. PHARAOH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Imhotep is dragged away by his priests. Anck spins around as
the Medjai enter. the room. She curses them and STABS HERSELF.

INT. KARNAC TEMPLE POOL — DAY

Meela CRIES OUT, her eyes snap open and go blank, as if she’s
just died from shock. Imhotep is now reading from the black
Book Of The Dead. Suddenly, Anck’s BOG SPIRIT rises up out of
pool and gloms onto Meela’s face and body. The bog spirit
sucks itself right into her. Anck awakens and looks at
Imhotep. He looks back at her, lovingly.

IMHOTEP
Anck-sunamun.

Anck stares at him, and then her face softens and she smiles.

ANCK-SUNAMUN
Imhotep.
Imhotep gestures around at the temple ruins surrounding them.
IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Our love has lasted longer than
the temples of our gods.

Anck passes her hand over his face in her special way, and
then they embrace and kiss passionately.

EXT. BLIMP — NIGHT
Izzy sits up in the cockpit, gliding the blimp through the
clouds. O’Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey sit around
a warm, glowing barrel of fire.
EvY
~80 I was Princess Nefertiri?

ARDETH BEY
Three thousand years ago.

Jonathan leans in to Ardeth Bey.
JONATHAN
I don’t suppose there’s an
anuheritance we should know about?

Ardeth Bey just smiles and looks back at Evy.

 
 

}

ARDETH BEY
Because of you, Imhotep was caught,
and then cursed for all time.

JONATHAN
No wonder they want you dead, Evy.

Ardeth Bey looks at O'Connell.

ARDETH BEY
Now do you believe, my friend?
Clearly you were destined to
protect this woman.

O'Connell gives Ardeth Bey a sarcastic look.

O'CONNELL
Right. Evy’s a reincarnated princess
and I’m descended from of an ancient
brotherhood of warriors.

ARDETH BEY
How else do you explain ber dreams,
and your tattoo?

O’CONNELL
Coincidence.

ARDETH BEY
My friend, there is a fine line
between coincidence, and Fate.

O'Connell shrugs it off, then wraps his arm around Evy,
getting a little frisky.

O'CONNELL
You know, I’ve never slept
with a princess before.
Evy gives him a big sarcastic smile.

EVY
No, but you’ve slept with a
bellydancer.

She gets up and walks off. O’Connell looks really bummed.
O’CONNELL
Aw c’mon, honey. She meant nothing!
I married you, didn't I1?

O’Connell gives Izzy an angry look. Izzy starts whistling
innocently and slides out of sight in the cockpit.
a

INT. TENT ~ NIGHT

Inside a tent, Alex paces .in a circle, and that’s all he can
do because his ankle is chained to a thick stake driven deep
into the ground. Lock-Nah rips the flap back and enters.

LOCK-NAH
When the time comes, I will
truly enjoy killing you.

Alex holds up the bracelet.

ALEX
Uh-uh-uh!

Lock-Nah freezes in his tracks. Alex smiles.

ALEX
But until that time you better
be a little nicer to me. Now
where's my water?

Lock-Nah angrily hands Alex a cup of water.

ALEX
No ice?

Lock=-Nah snarls and storms out of the tent. Alex smiles to
himself, then looks around to see if anyone’s watching hin.
He gets down on his hands and knees, spills the cup of water
onto a pile of sand and starts playing with it.

EXT. KARNAC TEMPLE - DAY

The train sits idle by the side of the great temple as
O'Connell stealthily moves through the ruins, guns up. He
stops and signals Ardeth Bey, who nods and dashes across the
sand and up to the train. Ardeth Bey sticks his gun into the
parlor car. It’s empty. O’Connell throws open the door to
Imhotep’s boxcar. It's also empty. --The last bit of sand
Grains out of the top of the HOURGLASS. O’Connell is crushed.

O'CONNELL
We're too late.

Ardeth Bey looks out across the deserted temple complex.

ARDETH BEY
They're gone. We’ve lost them!

And then O’Connell spots something. A glimmer of hope flits
across his eyes. He starts to run.
O'CONNELL
EVYL!

O'Connell races across the sand and up to a little BOY'S TIE
hanging from a branch.

O'CONNELL
Look! Alex lost his tie.

Evy runs up to him as he gestures with a smile.

O’ CONNELL
And he made a little sand castle.

TILT DOWN: from the tie to the ground. The tie is actually
pointing to a tiny “sand temple” on the ground. Intricately
shaped. Very distinctive. It’s what Alex was working on.

EVY
It’s the Temple Island of Philae.
(she smiles at O’Connell)
They're going to the Island
of Philae.

O'Connell is elated and proud.

O'CONNELL
Atta boy ALEX!

TIGHT ON: a tiny SCRAP OF PAPER with Arabic writing being
rolled up and stuck into a tiny tube. The tube is
magnetically stuck to the leg of Horus the falcon.
Ardeth Bey launches Horus, who flies off over the temple.

PUSH IN: on the tiny sand temple, then we do a perfect MATCH
DISSOLVE TO: THE ISLAND OF PHILAE, as the blimp touches down.

TIGHT ON: ALEX'S JACKET, lying on the ground. 0’Connell bends
down and picks it up, underneath it is another TINY SAND
TEMPLE: a cone shaped mountain with four Collossi. Evy grins.

Evy
The great temple of Abu Simbel.
Again, Ardeth Bey launches Horus, who flies away.
PUSH IN: on the tiny Abu Simbel sand castle, then MATCH
DISSOLVE TO: The Great Temple Of Abu Simbel as the blimp
lifts off from it. Horus flies right past CAMERA.
EXT. NUBIAN DESERT — DAY

Way off in the.distance,. traversing a huge sand dune, is a
caravan of a sixty men, one woman and one kid on camels.
71

TIGHT ON: Lock-Nah. Hearing the CRY OF A FALCON. A knowing
look crosses his face. His eyes scan the desert for Horus.

EXT. DESERT — DAY

Horus lands on the arm of a Medjai Commmander. Behind him are
@ HUNDRED WARRIORS on horseback. The Commander removes the
note from the tube and reads it, then CALLS OUT:

COMMANDER
La Nile Azur!

As the Commander and his men move out, WE CRANE UP: and over
the dune behind them, to reveal: TEN THOUSAND MORE WARRIORS.

EXT. NILE CANYONS — DAY

The blimp floats through deep canyons, following a river.
A BALD HEAD steps into the EXTREME FOREGROUND, watching the
blimp as it vanishes around a canyon corner. --It’s Imhotep.

EXT. BLIMP — DAY
O'Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey stare at the river.

O'CONNELL
That's the blue Nile down there.
We're out of Egypt now.

EVY
Yes, but we're still in
ancient Egypt. .

JONATHAN
How are we ever going to find
them in this maze of canyons?

EXT. NILE RIVER BANK CAMPSIGHT — DAY

Alex sits by the edge of the water, surreptitiously making a
design in the wet sand. A BOOT suddenly stomps on the design.
It's Lock-Nah. He YANKS Alex to his feet, furious.

LOCK-NAH
Leaving bread crumbs?

Imhotep steps up and looks down at the smashed design, then
he looks at Alex and starts speaking ANCIENT EGYPTIAN. --But
to Alex, it’s ENGLISH:

IMHOTEP
You-.are-very clever, little one.
I hope your mother and father
enjoyed their journey.
Imhotep turns and wades out into the Nile. He starts to raise
his arms. A MASSIVE WALL OF WATER RISES UP OUT OF THE RIVER.

EXT. BLIMP ~- DAY

o’Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey are looking out over
the bow of the fishing trawler. Suddenly, they hear a LOUD
RUMBLE. Izzy is the first one to look back and see it coming:

IZZY
What the hell?

A MASSIVE WALL OF WATER CRASHES DOWN THE CANYON. CHARGING
RIGHT AT THEM. Throwing rocks and boulders out of it’s way.
Everybody reacts. O’Connell YELLS at Izzy.

0’ CONNELL
Izzy! Go Right! Starboard!
Starboard! Starboard!

Izzy pulls the FLAME CABLE and turns the wheel. The blimp
ACCELERATES and starts to corner into a smaller side canyon.

A GIANT FACE forms inside the massive wall of water.
It's Imhotep. He starts to open his HUGE WATERY MOUTH.

Izzy ignites the afterburners and fires up the hand-made
booster rockets, -~-WHOOSH! FLAMES shoot out the rear of the
fishing trawler. The blimp makes it into the side canyon.
The massive wall of water doesn’t make the turn. Imhotep’s
watery face SCREAMS in anger as it explodes past the blimp.

Everybody stares back at the big canyon as it recedes.
Jonathan is the first one to turn and look forward. His jaw
just about hits the floor.

JONATHAN
Uhhhh people?

Everybody turns to see what Jonathan’s seeing. Up ahead, this
smaller canyon dumps into a MASSIVE BOWL SHAPED CANYON FILLED
WITH AN ENORMOUS JUNGLE. Ardeth Bey nods in wonderment.

ARDETH BEY
Ahm Shere.

O'Connell snaps out his telescope and zooms in. TELESCOPE
POV: way off across the jungle is the TIP of a GOLD PYRAMID.

O'CONNELL
You bet your ass it is.

And that's when they hear another RUMBLE. Izzy looks back.
—™,

IZzy
Son-of-a-SURF’S UUUUUP!

Another MASSIVE WALL OF WATER is charging down the canyon and
coming right at them. Imhotep’s crazed, watery face forms
inside it. He LAUGHS maniacally. HIS HUGE MOUTH OPENS WIDE to
swallow the blimp. Izzy kicks the throttle, ignites the
afterburners and fires up the booster rockets, giving it all.
she’s got, --WHOOSH! FLAMES shoot out the sides of the boat.

EXT. AHM SHERE — DAY

The blimp ACCELERATES out of the canyon, --but it’s too late.
The MASSIVE WAVE OF WATER explodes out of the canyon behind
it. Imhotep’s huge watery mouth ENGULFS THE BLIMP. The blimp
CRASHES down into the jungle along with a massive quantity of
water.

EXT. NILE RIVERBANK — DAY

Imhotep staggers out of the Nile, exhausted, his face
i . He looks at Alex. Alex reacts in horror.

EXT. JUNGLE — DAY

The blimp is half deflated; the trawler a torn up mess.
O'Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Ardeth Bey are putting on packs
filled with weaponry and gear. O’Connell looks at Izzy.

O*’CONNELL
I’m gonna go get my son, and
then I’m gonna wanna get out
quick, so make it work, Izzy.

Izzy is pacing and ranting angrily.

IZZY
You don’t understand, godammit!
It was filled with gas, not hot
air. I need gas toe get this thing
off the ground, where am I gonna
get gas around here? Tarzan’s
Fill ‘R Up!?

Jonathan makes sure Izzy isn’t looking, then he steals the
Scepter of Osiris and shoves it into his pack.

IZZY
Now I could maybe jerry-rig it
to take hot air, but you know
how many cubic meters I'd need?!
Gd

74

0’Connell walks up and slaps him on the back.

O'CONNELL
If. anybody can fill this
thing up with hot air, it’s you.

Ardeth Bey launches Horus as they head off into the jungle.
EXT. JUNGLE ROCKS — DAY

The CAMERA follows Horus as he flies up over the canopy.
Lock-Nah suddenly appears in the foreground, aiming down
the barrel of his rifle. He FIRES.

EXT. JUNGLE — DAY

Ardeth Bey spins around as he hears the report of a rifle and
the CRY of a falcon.

ARDETH BEY
Horus!

He staggers forward and stares up into the canopy, now it’s
Ardeth Bey’s turn to look devastated, A LONG BEAT, and then
he starts to take off his pack.

ARDETH BEY
The Army of Anubis will arise
from the sands outside of this
oasis. I must let the commanders
know where it is.

O’Connell gently grabs his arm and stops him.
O'CONNELL
I need you to help me get my
son back.
Ardeth Bey stares at him, sees the look in O’Conneli’s eyes.

ARDETH BEY
Then first, I shall help you.

O'Connell nods in appreciation. Ardeth Bey raises an eyebrow.

ARDETH BEY
And Imhotep?

O'Connell gives him his most dangerous smile.
O'CONNELL

Don't worry, this time I‘ll
put him down for good.
75

EXT. VALLEY OF THE DEAD — NIGHT

A FULL MOON shines down on the dark jungle. The High Priest
and Lock-Nah are on horses, leading a walking caravan of
black turbans carrying TORCHES. Imhotep and Anck are being
carried on pallets by red turbaned men. Alex is near the
back, his hands tied in front of him, looking a bit scared.

Everyone’s eyes widen in horror as they come upon HUNDREDS OF
ROTTED SKELETONS scattered throughout the jungle. Some piled
high, others lying off by themselves. Many appear to have
been barbecued alive on fire spits. All are wearing the
various tattered remains of once glorious uniforms and
armour. The FULL MOON gives them a creepy glow.

HIGH PRIEST
Over there, Roman Legionnaires.
And there, turn of the century
French, Napoleon’s troops.

LOCK-NAH
What in the name of Osiris did this?

Each and every person is terrified. All except Imhotep.
EXT. JUNGLE ROCKS — NIGHT

Q’Connell and Ardeth Bey are arming themselves to the teeth.
O'Connell suddenly looks around.

O'CONNELL
You hear that?

ARDETH BEY
What?

O* CONNELL
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
It’s dead silent. I've never
heard a jungle be so quiet.

The two men share a nervous look. Evy and Jonathan are

locking and loading rifles. Jonathan sees something and
brushes back the foliage. A dozen SHRUNKEN HEADS dangle
from a pole. Jonathan's eyes widen.

JONATHAN
I say, look at this, shrunken heads.
(lcoks closer)
I’d absolutely Jove to know how
they do that.

In unison, O’Connell, Evy and Ardeth Bey all give him a look.
d

 

Jonathan looks indignant.

JONATHAN
Just curious.

He hefts a longrifle. Ardeth Bey looks at him.

ARDETH BEY
Are you any good with that?

JONATHAN
(outraged)
Three time Fox and Hound Grand
Champion, I‘11 have you know!

He fumbles with the rifle, almost drops it.
JONATHAN
That was of course before I
started drinking.
O'Connell steps up to his wife.
O'CONNELL
You remember everything I've
taught you over the years?
Evy looks him square in the eyes.

EvY
I won't miss.

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING — NIGHT

The caravan comes into a clearing. Par off in the distance,
they all see the TIP of the GOLD PYRAMID spiking the stars.
Imhotep grins. The High Priest, Lock-Nah, and Anck all smile.
In the back, Alex is suddenly looking very nervous.

ALEX
Cripes, i’m in trouble now.

Lock-Nah whispers to the High Priest, who nods and looks back
at Imhotep.

HIGH PRIEST
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
My Lord, now there is no need for
the boy.

Imhotep gives.him a. knowing -grin.
 

IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Do with him as you please.

Lock-Nah grins, then turns his horse and starts riding back
down the moving caravan, heading for Alex. Alex’s eyes widen.
He tries to back away, but is pushed forward. Then suddenly,
for no reason, Lock-Nah‘s horse STOPS and starts BUCKING and
WHINNYING WILDLY. The High Priest’s horse does the same. The
whole caravan is forced to come to a stop. The two men prod
at their spooked horses and curse them in Arabic.

A GENTLE BREEZE begins to blow through the jungle and swirl
around the caravan, accompanied by a creepy SOUND, like an
eerie wind whistling through dry bones. Imhotep knows what’s
coming. He YELLS a command to the men carrying him. They set
him and Anck down.

One of the black turbaned men sees something lying against

a tree, almost molded into it. He slowly approaches. It’s a
hideous PYGMY CORPSE. Branches and vines have grown through
it’s bones, which are bleached a ghostly white. The man leans
in for a closer look at the gruesome thing. It’s crusty
eyelids suddenly SNAP OPEN. The Man SCREAMS. It has no eyes.
It HISSES through rotted teeth and STABS him in the chest
with a small spear. The Man SCREAMS LOUDER and dies.

EXT. JUNGLE — NIGHT

O'Connell and Ardeth Bey hear the SCREAM. And then the gentle
BREEZE starts to whistle around them. The two men look at
each other. Eyes on fire. O'Connell hefts the two revolvers
in his hands and nods his head. Ardeth Bey lifts a machine-
gun in one hand and a sword in the other, and nods back.
They both take off running through the jungle. Full bore.

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING — NIGHT

As the BREEZE turns into a strong WIND, Lock-Nah and the High
Priest are THROWN from their horses. All the black turbaned
men aim their guns into the foliage, their fear-filled eyes
sweeping the jungle. The creepy NOISE is getting louder and
closer. :

EXT. ROCKS ~ NIGHT

Evy hefts the rifle to her shoulder and adjusts the sight.

EVY
Jonathan?

: JONATHAN
Yes?

 
(h

EVY
That’s my husband and my son
down there, ~make me proud.

JONATHAN
(sincere)
Today, is that day.

EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING — NIGHT

o’Conneli and Ardeth Bey crash through the jungle, coming
up on the caravan from the rear. O'Connell spots Alex.

Lock-Nah is also heading for Alex. And he's only ten feet
away. Alex sees him coming. His eyes widen in terror.
Lock-~Nah withdraws his razor sharp scimitar, --SHING!

OKAY. HERE WE GO. EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE:

A black turbaned man suddenly jerks forward SCREAMING.

He spins around, his back is plastered with BLOW DARTS.
The surrounding foliage suddenly comes alive with MOVEMENT,
accompanied by a horrible HISSING sound. Arrows and blow
darts explode out of the bushes. The black turbaned men all
panic and aimlessly OPEN FIRE.

Alex backs away from Lock-Nah, who is still coming at him,
but starting to lose him in the exploding frenzy.

TIGHT ON: O’Connell. Bis eyes never leaving Alex.

Imhotep grabs Anck’s hand and starts to pull her away. Anck
iunges back and grabs the Book of the Dead off her pallet.
The two of them run off into the jungle.

O'Connell and Ardeth Bey sprint into the frenzy, cutting down
black and red turbaned men with equal abandon, like two human
scythes. O’Connell goes empty, tosses his pistols. Several
black turbaned men turn to shoot him, --but are suddenly shot
off their feet because:

UP IN THE ROCKS: Evy and Jonathan are FIRING round after
round. Perfect precision, Completely emotionless. We look
down their GUNSIGHTS: they’re actually clearing a path for
O'Connell and Ardeth Bey, shooting men out of their way.

Lock-Nah steps up to Alex and raises his scimitar.

O’Connell grabs a shotgun shouldered across his back, whips
it forward and CHARGES for Alex.

Lock-Nah SWINGS his scimitar down at Alex with all his might.
Alex SCREAMS. The scimitar PRANGS off O'Connell’s shotgun.
O'Connell scoops Alex up on the run. Doesn't even slow down.

 

 
Lock-Nah spins around and is about to throw his scimitar at
O’Connell’s back, when Ardeth Bey leaps out of the fray and
the two men immediately. go at it. All the other men are
SCREAMING, running, SHOOTING and dying.

O’Connell throws Alex up over his shoulder. Alex is now
leoking back. His eyes pop wide.

ALEX
Dad! BEHIND YOU!

O'Connell spins around, sees TWO HIDEOUS PYGMY SKELETONS hot
on their tail. He lifts his shotgun and FIRES. Both barrels.
Point blank. Blows the pygmy skeletons to smithereens.

Ardeth Bey and Lock-Nah are fiercely BATTLING AWAY. Scimitar
against scimitar. Ardeth Bey is clearly more pissed-off, more
aggressive. He spins around and SLICES Lock-Nah’s chest, then
UPPERCUTS him across the stomach. Lock-Nah drops to his
knees, mortally wounded. Ardeth Bey stares down at him.

ARDETH BEY
That, «was for Horus.

The MOUNTAIN OF FLESH who grabbed Evy at her home runs up
behind Ardeth Bey, about to decapitate him with a scimitar.
Ardeth Bey doesn’t even see him. At the very last second the
mountain of flesh is hit by muitiple bullets.

UP IN THE ROCKS: Evy lowers her rifle.

EVY
Let’s go Jonathan.

Jonathan lowers his rifle, a complete emotional wreck.

JONATHAN
Thank God.

They head off down the rocks.

BACK WITH ARDETH BEY: as he grabs the reins of Lock-Nah’s
horse, swings himself up into the saddle and GALLOPS OFF.
Lock-Nah falls face first into the mud. Dead as lead.

EXT. QUICKSAND & BURIAL GROUND ~— NIGHT

The High Priest and a dozen black and red turbaned men run
for their lives through the jungle. The terrifying HISSING
SOUND of pygmy skeletons fills the air, chasing after then,
hunting them down, picking them off one-by-one, relentless.
o>

   

Four men fall into a PIT OF QUICKSAND. They flail about,
trying to get out. The High Priest and the others don't
even slow down to help, ea bunch of pygmy skeletons run
right over them, forcing them deeper into the muck, using
them as stepping stones on their way after the others.

The last two men are TACKLED to the ground by a group of
pygmy skeletons, who immediately start GNAWING on them.

The High Priest and his Servant run out into a clearing and
race across a LINE OF WHITE STONES and small earthen mounds.

HIGH PRIEST
Look! A sacred burial ground!
We're safe. They’11 never cross it.

They come to a stop twenty feet beyond the markings.

SERVANT
Are you sure?

A PYGMY SKELETON sprints right over the burial stones and
STABS the Servant in the heart with a spear, then runs off.
The High Priest looks at his dying Servant.

HIGH PRIEST
My mistake.

The Servant gives the High Priest an incredulous look, then
keels over dead. The High Priest hears more pygmies skeletons
coming. Frightened, he quickly withdraws a ceremonial dagger
and sticks the sharp blade to his eyebrows. His other hand
grasps his scalp. WE CUT AWAY as he starts to slice.

EXT. JUNGLE — NIGHT

The High Priest’s painful SCREAMS echo through the jungle as
Alex leaps into Evy’s arms. O’Connell runs up and slaps
Jonathan on the back with a smile.

O'CONNELL
Great shootin’, Tex!

Ardeth Bey gallops up, reaches into his pocket and flips
something to O’Connell.

ARDETH BEY
Take this.

O'Connell checks it out. It’s a beautiful GOLD BRAND with a
precise MASONIC TEMPLAR LOGO gorgeously welded onto it.

- ARDETH BEY
Burn it into your son's arn.
He has earned it.

 
81

O'Connell gives him a look like he‘s out of his mind.

O’ CONNELL
Maybe where you come from.

Ardeth Bey rears his horse.

ARDETH BEY
T must go and signal my men.

O/Connell starts to hand Ardeth Bey his shotgun.

O'CONNELL
Take this.

ARDETH BEY
(shakes his head)
No. There is only one way to
kill an Anubis warrior.

He whips out his scimitar, --SHING!

ARDETH BEY
You must take off it’s head,
HEYA!
He gallops off.
ARDETH BEY

Good luck, my friends!

O’Connell, Evy, Jonathan and Alex suddenly hear the SOUND of
HISSING pygmies, coming fast.

O'CONNELL
Time to go.

They all turn and haul-ass into the jungle.
INT. JUNGLE — DAWN

Imhotep strides through the jungle, holding Anck’s hand.
A group of pygmy skeletons suddenly races up behind them.
Imhotep spins around to face them.

The pygmy skeletons skid to a stop and stare at Imhotep,
HISSING, about to pounce. Anck is terrified. And then Imhotep
unhinges his jaw, OPENS HIS MOUTH EXTRA WIDE and ROARS.
The creepy little corpses bow their heads and back away.
Imhotep grins, then grabs Anck’s hand and continues on.
}

 

INT. JUNGLE — DAWN

O'Connell, Evy, Alex and Jonathan race through the jungle.
The horrific SOUND of pygmy skeletons following them fills
the air. They look back and see a huge HORDE chasing after
them. Evy throws her rifle away. So does Jonathan. Everyone
trying to run faster. O'Connell spots the TIP of the GOLD
PYRAMID, they’re closer now, maybe only a mile away.

They race out across a huge log spanning a deep ravine. On
the other side, O’Connell skids to a stop, frisks himself and
pulls out a lone stick of dynamite. The pygmy skeletons start
to race across the log. O’Connell lights the fuse an inch
from the dynamite, then tosses it to the first skeleton and
runs like hell. The pygmy skeleton grabs the dynamite. The
dynamite EXPLODES. The log and the skeletons are blown apart.

O'Connell runs up to the others, all breathing hard.

O'CONNELL
Alright, I think we made it.

And that’s when another horde of the hideous pygmy skeletons
sprint out and form a blockade in front of them. A LONG BEAT,
and then one of the pygmy skeletons races straight at Alex,
HISSING horribly, spear in hand. Alex holds up his hands to
defend himself. The pygmy skeleton skids to a stop, HISSING
in fear, he backs away. Alex sees that it was the bracelet on
his wrist that did it. He holds up his wrist to show all the
s. They all HISS in fear, which sounds really creepy and
horrible, then they back away and vanish into the jungle.

O'Connell, Evy and Jonathan are shocked and relieved.
Alex grabs O’Connell’s arm and starts tugging him forward.

ALEX
C’mon! Dad! C’mon! We have to
get to that pyramid! I have to
get the bracelet off now!

Jonathan waves him off, totally exhausted.

JONATHAN
Leave it on, Alex, it looks good on you.

O'CONNELL
Relax, buddy, we’ll get there.

ALEX
No you guys! You don’t understand!
He told me the bracelet will kill
me if I don’t get inside the pyramid
before the sun hits it! Today!
 

O'Connell, Evy and Jonathan all immediately realize the
implications. They quickly look off towards the surrounding
mountains. --The SUN is. just about to crest the east face.

EVY
Qn my God.

o’Connell grabs Alex’s hand and starts to run with him.

O’ CONNELL
C’MONI

And they’re off!! Blasting through the jungle as fast as
they can. O’Cconnell looks up. The SUN CRESTS THE MOUNTAINS.
CUT HIGH AND WIDE: looking down on the jungle canopy as the
SUNLIGHT starts to move across it like the tide, heading
straight for the gold pyramid, getting closer and closer,
about to light it up.

O'Connell and Alex run faster and faster. Alex starts to
collapse in pain. 0’Connell scoops him up and runs faster,
he races across a clearing and DIVES through one of the many
arched entryways just as the SUN STRIKES the huge GOLD
pyramid, causing a blinding FLASH OF LIGET.

INT. TEMPLE ENTRANCE — DAY
O’Connell and Alex lie on the floor, exhausted and panting.

O’CONNELL
Ya know, it’s hard being a dad.

Alex looks over and grins at him.

ALEX
Yeah, but you do it real good.

O’Connell wraps his arm around Alex and drags him up close.
Alex hugs him back. The bracelet POPS OFF. Alex grabs it and
angrily FLINGS it across the entranceway.

EXT. GOLD PYRAMID — DAY

Evy and Jonathan stagger out of the jungle and into the
clearing. Evy smiles as she sees O’Connell and Alex safe
inside the pyramid. Jonathan just stares up in wonder at the
huge gold monolith. And then Evy hears something and turns
around. --Anck is right there. She drives a dagger into Evy’s
stomach. Evy doesn’t even scream, just stares at Anck,
incredulous. Jonathan.spins around. Imhotep GRABS him by the
throat, LIFTS him up and THROWS him across the clearing.
INT. TEMPLE ENTRANCE — DAY

O’Connell and Alex spin around and look outside just as
Anck withdraws her dagger from Evy‘s stomach. Evy crumples
to the ground. O’Connell jumps to his feet.

O*’ CONNELL
NoooOo!!!

EXT. PYRAMID — DAY

O'Connell sprints out of the pyramid, heading for Evy.
Alex is right behind him, he sees Imhotep and Anck running
into another entrance. Anck blows a kiss at Alex with one
hand, while holding the Book of the Dead in the other.

Evy is curled up and holding her stomach as O’Connell kneels
down next to her. He gently rolls her over. Her eyelids
flutter. He rips her shirt open. His eyes widen.

O*’CONNELL
Oh no, oh no-no-no, this isn’t
happening. This can’t happen.

Alex runs up. O’Connell quickly waves him off.

©’ CONNELL
Stay back Alex! Stay back!

Alex freezes, looking more scared than he’s ever looked.

ALEX
She‘s alright isn’t she, Dad?
Mum’s gonna be alright?

Jonathan steps up and hugs Alex tight to his side.
O'Connell stares into Evy’s weak eyes.

O’ CONNELL
You’re gonna make it, Evy, you’re
real strong. Just, just hang on.

O'Connell looks around, out of his mind with desperation.

O'CONNELL
Where’s some.. don’t we have any.
she needs help.

Evy tries to talk. O’Connell touches her lips with his
fingers.

O'CONNELL

No, no, no, don’t say anything,
save your.., —just, .~oh god Evy.
O'Connell hugs her tighter, he can feel the Grim Reaper
coming to take her away, he can’t think he’s so desperate.

O’CONNELL
What do I do, Evy? What do I do?

Evy
«take, —take care of Alex.

Alex starts to sob, Jonathan hugs him tighter.
O'Connell chokes back the tears, caressing her face.

O’CONNELL
You can’t leave me. ..I need
you so much.

With her last bit of strength, Evy gives him a weak grin.

EVY
Love you.

O'Connell gently presses his lips to hers, and then he looks
into her eyes for the last time, devastated.

She dies. Right there. In his arms. 0’Connell hugs her tight.
INT. TEMPLE ENTRANCE — DAY

A HAND grabs the bracelet up off the floor. It’s the High
Priest, --all the skin on his skull above his eyebrows

« He looks horrific. He stares at the
bracelet maniacally.

INT. SAND STEPS — DAY

Imhotep and Anck come down the STAIRS MADE OF SAND. At the
bottom is a large gold CREST embossed with a gold scorpion.
Imhotep steps onto the crest. His entire body immediately
SPASMS, as if hit by an electrical shock. He CRIES OUT. Anck
jumps back and watches. Imhotep’s face slowly REGENERATES,
until he looks strong and healthy and whole once again.

And then it’s over. Anck stares at him, thrilled.

ANCK
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
You are healed! The curse is gone!

Imhotep looks stunned, he stares at his hands in despair.
IMHOTEP

(ancient Egyptian - subtitied)
~but so are my powers.

 
o™

 

For the second time in his life, Imhotep looks vulnerable.
Anck just grins like the Chesire cat and carresses his face.

ANCK
Do not fear, my love. If he
kills you.

She holds up the BOOK OF THE DEAD.

ANCK
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
!

EXT. PYRAMID — DAY

Evy lies dead on the ground. O’Connell takes Alex's jacket
and starts to cover her face, he can’t bring himself to do
it. He tucks the jacket under her chin and gently smoothes it
over her chest. He stands up and looks at Alex and Jonathan.

O’ CONNELL
Stay here.

He gives one last sad look down at Evy, and then his face
goes hard and he turns and strides towards the pyramid.

0’ CONNELL
I’m going to finish this.

INT. KEYROOM - DAY

The High Priest solemnly steps up to a bas-relief of human
skulls and bones embedded into thick gold, shaped into a
large SCORPION. In each of it’s arms is a small, gold,
close-quarter combat WEAPON.

The High Priest looks at the bracelet, now on his wrist,
then at a HOLE in the scorpion’s mouth. He shoves his hand
into the hole up to his elbow, then turns his arm like a key.
There is the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING UNLOCKED and then a
vaporous “ELECTRICAL CHARGE” spreads out from the hole and
passes over the entire room, clearing the gold walls of
fungus and mold. The High Priest stares in wonder.

INT. TUNNEL — DAY

A TORCH WIPES FRAME. It’s O’Connell, creeping down a tunnel,
unarmed but for the torch. The gold walls are covered in
green mold and fungus. O’Connell’s eyes widen as the vaporous
electrical charge comes racing down the tunnel walls. He
spins around as it passes by him. The fungus and mold on the
walls are WIPED CLEAN. The gold looks brand spanking new.
EXT. DESERT — DAY

The vaporous electrical charge spreads out across a GIANT
DUNE made of BLACK SAND. As it subsides, WE PAN: to reveal
a GOLDEN SAND DUNE opposite the black one. Thousands upon
thousands of Medjai Warriors crest the gold dune on horses.

Ardeth Bey scans the black sand, then looks off and sees the
TIP of the gold pyramid rising above the distant dunes.

INT. KEYROOM ~ DAY

O’Connell enters the keyroom. The High Priest is struggling
to withdraw his arm, which is stuck inside.

HIGH PRIEST
You're too late, O’Connell!
I have released the Army of
Anubis! Lord Imhotep shall
soon take command!

O'Connell pulls a small ancient DOUBLE-AX out of the gold
scorpion’s grasp.

O'CONNELL
Not after I get through with him.

The bracelet gets unstuck and the High Priest starts to
withdraw his arm, --then suddenly his arm is GRABBED from
inside. The High Priest's eyes widen in terror. He starts
tugging on his arm, trying to wrench it free. Then he starts

SCREAMING IN AGONY as the SOUND of something EATING HIS ARM
is heard, and the CRUNCHING OF BONES and the GNASHING OF
HIDEOUS TEETH.

O'Connell backs away, half horrified, half gratified.
The High Priest finally rips his arm out, or what's left of
it, --under his torn robe there’s only a stump. The High
Priest staggers off down a tunnel SCREAMING in pain.
O’Connell backs out of the room, double~ax. up.

NT. STATUARY MAZE — DAY

Imhotep and Anck creep through a MAZE OF GOLD STATUARY and up
to a spooky, mist shrouded GATEWAY. Imhotep grabs two small
combat weapons off a statue and turns to Anck.

IMHOTEP

(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
I must face the Scorpion King alone.
c---

Anck nods, stares at him for a beat, then sets the Book of
the Dead down, grabs his face and kisses him passionately.

EXT. PYRAMID — DAY

Jonathan and Alex are kneeling next to Evy’s dead body. Alex
is sobbing. Jonathan is devastated and hugging him tight.

JONATHAN
Try and.., try and think of it
like this, Alex, —she’s.. she’s
in a better place.. Like the
good book says—

-~Alex jerks himself away from Jonathan, eyes on fire.

ALEX
What?

JONATHAN
What-what??

ALEX

--That’s it! THAT’S IT!

JONATHAN
What’s it? WHAT’S IT?

Alex leaps to his feet and starts pulling at Jonathan.

ALEX
C’mon Uncle Jon! I got an idea!

INT. NETHERWORLD — DAY

O'Connell walks through a strange Netherworld: weird smoke
and eerie shadows play across the Stygian landscape. Water
DRIPS. A distant wind HOWLS. He sees Imhotep standing in
front of a GIANT GONG mounted near a set of HUGE DOORS.

O'Connell starts to jump over a CREVICE. Imhotep BANGS the
gong with a “gongpole”. The entire chamber TREMBLES from the
vibrations. O'Connell loses his balance and almost falls into
the crevice. He looks down into it, --it DROPS TO ETERNITY.

EXT. DUNES — DAY

Ten thousand Medjai prepare for battle along the top of the
golden dune. Ardeth Bey suddenly senses something coming,
like a wave at night, dark and terrifying. He looks over to
see the black dune STARTING TO COME ALIVE with WRITHING
FORMS. CUT TIGHTER: to-see that the black sand is slowly
FORMING ITSELF INTO THOUSANDS OF HIDEOUS ANUBIS WARRIORS.

 
INT. TUNNEL - DAY
Jonathan and Alex carry Evy’s inert body down a tunnel.

JONATHAN
you realize of course that
it can only be done by someone
who can actually read ancient
Egyptian. I don’t know about
you, but I’m a tad rusty.

They come to a fork in the tunnel.

ALEX
Go left.

JONATHAN
How do you know?

Alex nods to some ancient HIEROGLYPHS above the left doorway.

ALEX
“Iman kasheesh ifran Osirian
nye”, Basically, “this way
to the Scorpion King”.

Jonathan looks at him. Alex gives him a sad little grin.

ALEX
Mum taught me.

Jonathan is stunned.

J
This just might work.

Imhotep BANGS the gong, then starts to set the gongpole down.
O'Connell leaps forward and SWINGING the double-ax at him.
Imhotep quickly lifts the pole. The ax CLEAVES into it. Gets
stuck in the wood. The men struggle. The ax and the pole are
thrown across the floor and skitter down into the crevice.
The two men square off. O’Connell looks like a man possessed.

O'CONNELL
Never thought I’d have to kill
You again.
Imhotep grins. They start to circle each other.

: O'CONNELL
But I’m happy to get the chance.

Anck is staring through the gateway when she hears somebody
clear their throat. She turns and looks. It’s Jonathan.
He puts up his dukes, English style.

JONATHAN
Come and get it, you wench!

Anck smirks, then sets the book down and strides forward.
Jonathan starts to bob and weave.

JONATHAN
This is for my sister.

Alex sneaks up and grabs the book. He looks over in time to
see Anck plaster Jonathan with two front JABS to his face.

O'Connell and Imhotep viciously and relentlessly PUNCH, KICK,
ELBOW and BACKHAND each other. Expertly fighting hand-to-hand

two men freeze and look around. Something’s coming. O’Connell
recovers first and throws a HOOK into Imhotep’s jaw. Imhotep
SLAMS up against a weapon-wielding scorpion statue. He grabs
a small trident and a scythe. O’Connell steps over to another
statue and grabs two of the same. They starts to circle.

ALEX

Efday Shokran..? Efday Shokran..?
I don’t know what this last

Jonathan frantically raises his spear, trying to defend
himself as Anck batters the hell out of him.

JONATHAN
What's it look like!?

Flustered, Alex starts flapping his arms like a bird.
ALEX
it's a., it’s a., it’s a bird!
A stork!

Anck grabs Jonathan by the throat, slams him up against

A HAND grabs her wrist, --SLAP! Stopping the blade from
piercing Jonathan’s throat. Anck’s head whips around to
see who grabbed her. --It’s Evy. She shoves Anck away.

The two women face off. Alex steps up.

ALEX
Hey mum, can I throw a rock at her?

Evy keeps her eyes on Anck.

EVY
The two of you go help your father.

ALEX
But mum—
EVY
--No buts. I'l] be fine.
Jonathan grabs Alex and starts to hustle him away.
ALEX
What about mum!?

JONATHAN
She said she'd be fine. When was

ever wrong about. anything?
Anck wields her trident and stares at Evy.

ANCK
Nefertiri.

Evy grabs another small trident off a statue and stares back.

Anck-sunamun.

Anck smiles, pleased that Evy knows who they both are.

ANCK
Good.

They raise their weapons.
INT. NETHERWORLD — DAY

O'Connell and Imhotep CLASH and lock steel. The two men go
face-to-face. Staring into each other's angry eyes.

And that’s when the huge doors BURST OPEN. For a BEAT, there
is nothing there, and then the SCORPION KING slowly lowers
himself down from the ceiling, still partly hidden in shadow.
From the waist up, he’s exactly how we remember him; a huge,
muscular, vicious warrior, but from the waist down, --he’s

avery large SCORPION. AN EGYPTIAN MINOTAUR.

O'Connell and Imhotep stare in awe at the horrid creature,
then they look at each other, then back at the Scorpion King.
The two men break away from each other and back off in
opposite directions, keeping their eyes on the creature.

CHEERS. All except Ardeth Bey and a few Commanders standing

three thousand years ago. Using the small tridents, the two
gorgeous women expertly PUNCH, KICK, ELBOW and BACKHAND each
other as they brilliantly fight across the maze floor.

INT. NETHERWORLD - DAY

The Scorpion King suddenly and quite angrily scuttles up to
Imhotep. Imhotep backs away, then, thinking quick, he grabs
his scalp and RIPS the skin off the top of his decrepit
skull. He kneels down and slaps his hideous dry skulicap.

IMHOTEP
Mi Phat Ahs! Mi Phat Ahs!
(subtitled)
I am your disciple!
 

The Scorpion King stops and stares down at him, then slowly
nods and turns and heads for O0’Connell. Imhotep lifts his
eyes, grinning evilly. He’s fooled him.

O'Connell backs up into a pillar, terrified, then slaps his
own head and tries to mimic Imhotep’s ancient Egyptian:

O'CONNELL
My fat ass! My fat ass!

The Scorpion King LASHES down at him with one of his big
skeletal pincers. O'Connell DIVES out of the way just as
the pincers SHEAR through the pillar. O’Connell runs like
hell. The High Priest suddenly stumbles into his path,
holding his stump and whimpering. O’Connell grabs a HELMET
off a statue, SLAPS it onto the High Priest’s head, then
turns him around and kicks him in the ass, sending him
towards the Scorpion King. The High Priest looks up in
stunned amazement as the Scorpion King storms up to him.
The High Priest suddenly recovers and YELLS:

HIGH PRIEST
Mi Phat Ahs! Mi Phat Ahs!

He pats his head, --but the helmet is covering his skull. His
eyes widen in panic. He quickly tries to get the helmet off,
but it’s stuck tight to his head. The Scorpion King’s pincers
GRAB the High Priest around the waist and lift him up. The .
High Priest SCREAMS in terror. The pincers CUT HIM IN HALF.

EXT. DUNES — DAY

The remaining Medjai are still CHEERING when a strange SOUND
stops them cold. Ardeth Bey quickly turns to the dune behind
them, clambers up it and looks over the other side. Spread
out across the plain in front of him are FIFTY THOUSAND
ANUBIS WARRIORS. The Medjai are vastly outnumbered.

ARDETH BEY
Allah save us.

INT. STATUARY MAZE — DAY

Anck is viciously thrown to the floor. Evy lunges forward,
stopping her knife a quarter inch before it plunges into
Anck’s neck. Evy’s eyes are on fire, she wants to do it
badly. Anck forces herself to smile.

ANCK-SUNAMUN ©
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
You have improved greatly,
Princess Nefertiri.

And that’s when they hear the Scorpion King BELLOW IN FuRY.
Evy is distracted. Anck knocks the trident away and takes off
running. Evy hauls tail after her.

©’Connell is SLAMMED up against a wall next to a LIFE SIZED
CARTOUCHE OF A MAN. O’Connell shakes off the cobwebs in his
head, then notices the cartouche. It’s actually holding the
SCEPTER OF OSIRIS. And then O’Connell’s eyes get really big.

WE GO TIGHT ON THE TATTOO on O’Connell‘s arm, then PAN OVER
to the cartouche’s arm, it has the exact same MASONIC TEMPLAR
TATTOO! The Scorpion King’s tail suddenly PULVERIZES the
cartouche, missing O’Connell’s head by an inch. O’Connell
leaps away. Dives and rolls. Pops up on his feet.

O* CONNELL
Okay, okay, I’m a believer,
I’m a believer.

He looks back at the cartouche wall, --which is actually a
PICTOGRAPH, multiple cartouche’s of the same Man: holding the
Scepter of Osiris; fiddling with the head of it; and then
telescoping it out into a SPEAR! The last cartouche shows the
man throwing the spear at a likeness of the Scorpion King.

O'CONNELL
That’s it.

O’Connell ducks as the Scorpion King’s tail whips over his
head and takes out another pillar. He takes off running.

Jonathan and Alex race into the cavern and skid to a stop,
they go wide-eyed as they see the Scorpion King CRASHING
through the landscape chasing O’Connell. O0’Connell sees them.

0’ CONNELL
Jonathan! Alex! It’s a spear!
The scepter is a spear! It
opens up into a spear!

JONATHAN
Yes? And?

O’CONNELL
IT CAN KILL HIM!!

JONATHAN
Ah! I seel

Alex quickly grabs’ the Scepter away from Jonathan.
 

Gimme that!
From across the cavern, Imhotep sees the Scepter.

IMHOTEP
{ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
The Scepter Of Osiris!

EXT. DUNES — DAY

The massive horde of Anubis Warriors SHRIEK WILDLY and then
start to stampede across the plain, heading right for the
remaining Medjai. It’s going to be a very quick slaughter.

The Medjai look shocked and defeated.

And then Ardeth Bey grits his teeth, clenches his sword and
yells out a BATTLE CRY. The other Medjai look at him. A true
warrior to the bitter end. This gives them courage. They all
clench their swords and join in his BATTLE CRY.

INT. NETHERWORLD ~ DAY

The Scorpion King’s pincers and stingers SLASH and TEAR their
way through the pillars and walls, trying to kill O'Connell.
Jonathan and Alex are deciphering the hieratic on the scepter
and futzing with the various indentations on the head of it.

Imhotep CHARGES across the cavern, heading for Alex and
Jonathan. Anck and Evy race in. They both skid to a stop as
they see the Scorpion King’s pincer SWAT O’Connell.

Evy
RIIICK!

O'Connell SPIRALS through the air, SLAMS into a wall and
lands on his ass, spread-eagled. He sees Evy. His face
twists, half smiling, half crying.

O'CONNELL
Oh my God, Evy.

--The Scorpion King’s stinger SLAMS down between his legs,
SMASHING a hole in the floor. O’Connell leaps to his feet and
grabs his trident off the floor, suddenly full of life.

O’ CONNELL
Hurry up and use that damn
thing will ya!!

He whips the trident at the Scorpion King, --but it just

bounces harmlessly off his shell. Imhotep is twenty feet
away from Alex and Jonathan and closing quickly.
 

Jonathan twists the bottom of the Scepter, it SLIDES OPEN,
revealing a SHARP TIP. Alex grabs it and TELESCOPES it out
another four feet; =-now it looks just like a spear. Jonathan
sees Imhotep coming. He snatches the spear away from Alex.

JONATHAN
Move out of the way, I’m a
professional.

He quickly aims it at the Scorpion King. Imhotep is almost on
top of him. Jonathan THROWS IT. Imhotep SCREAMS:

IMHOTEP
NIIIIIY!

The Scorpion King spins around and BATS THE SPEAR AWAY with
his stinger. It SPINS off through the air.

EXT. DUNES — DAY

The Anubis Warriors race full bore at the Medjai. SHRIEKING
WILDLY. A hundred yards away. Now eighty yards. Now sixty.
Fifty. Forty. Ardeth Bey is to die.

INT. NETHERWORLD - DAY

The spear SPINS across the room like a propeller. O’Connell
leaps up and grabs it out of the air. Hits the ground running
and heaves the spear back at the Scorpion King. It NAILS him
right in the chest. With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and
rage, the Scorpion King staggers back. Imhotep can't believe
it, he runs towards the Scorpion King HOWLING in rage.

IMHOTEP
NIIIIYY!!

The Scorpion King looks at O’Connell and BELLOWS horribly.
O'Connell fights his pain, grits his teeth and stares back.

O'CONNELL
Go to hell.

The Scorpion King EXPLODES into BLACK VAPOR. Total BLACK OUT.
EXT. SAND DUNES — DAY
The Medjai are three feet away from being stampeded by the

huge mass of Anubis Warriors when all of a sudden the they
EXPLODE INTO BLACK SAND and dissipate across the Medjai.
EXT. PYRAMID/OASIS — DAY

THICK BLACK VAPOR EXPLODES out of all the arches around
the pyramid and then.MUSHROOMS up into the sky like a
thermonuclear blast. The giant mushroom cloud takes the
form of the SCORPION KING'S FACE SCREAMING IN RAGE.

EXT. SAND DUNES — DAY

Ardeth Bey and the Medjai watch as the horrific cloud quickly
reaches it’s apex. The Scorpion King’s CLOUD FACE gives one
last BELLOW, and then the whole thing IMPLODES IN ON ITSELF.
Actually being sucked back into the pyramid.

INT. NETHERWORLD — DAY

The whole place starte SHAKING LIKE MAD. The crevice SPLITS
WIDER. O’Connell and Imhotep are knocked into it crevice.
Evy lunges forward.

EVY
NOOOO!!!

But she’s forced back by all the RAZOR SHARP STALACTITES that
start DROPPING LIKE MISSILES from the ceiling.

INSIDE THE CREVICE: O’Connell and Imhotep cling to the
crevice wall for dear life, below them is a drop to eternity.
With the last of their strength they both manage to climb up
to the edge of the crevice. But they’re both starting to lose
strength. They can’t hold on much longer.

Evy is desperate to dash to her husband and help him, but the
stalactites keep falling. O'Connell sees the look in her
eyes.
O*CONNELL
Stay there Evy! You stay there!

Imhotep desperately claws at the ledge. He sees Anck.

IMHOTEP
Anck-sunamun!
(ancient Egyptian — subtitled)
Help me!

Anck stares at Imhotep. Evy stares at O’Connell. A minefield
of deadly falling stalactites between them. Evy goes for it.
Running like mad for the man she loves. Anck turns and runs
off down a tunnel. Imhotep can’t believe his eyes.

IMHOTEP
ANCK-SUNAMUN! !
NY

  

Anck vanishes down the tunnel. Imhotep looks like his whole
world has just collapsed.

IMHOTEP
Anck-sunamun??

He looks over and sees Evy dive up to the edge of the crevice
and grab O'Connell's arm. Evy helps yank O'Connell up and
over the lip of the crevice to relative safety.

O'Connell and Evy look at Imhotep, who is totally devastated.
He stares at them, A LONG BEAT, and almost smiles. Then he
let's go of the crevice wail and FALLS FOR ETERNITY...

INT. KEYROOM — DAY

Anck dashes into the keyroom just as the far wall COLLAPSES,
blocking her path, she sees that she’s standing at the edge
of a moat FILLED WITH WRIGGLING SCORPIONS. Her eyes widen in
horror. She turns and starts to run back the way she came.

The room VIOLENTLY SHAKES. Anck loses her balance. Her arms
flail wildly as she teeters on the edge of the scorpion
filled moat, she has just long enough to realize the
ramifications if she falls in, --and then she falls in.

Anck SCREAMS and FLAILS wildly as the mass of scorpions
envelop and STING her. She sinks into the mass of wriggling
scorpions and, still SCREAMING, vanishes under them.

INT. ENTRANCEWAY — DAY
Inside the entranceway, BLACK VAPOR AND MASSIVE FOLIAGE are
being SUCKED through every archway and down into a huge hole
in the middle of the chamber.
Our heroes climb up out of a small hole in the floor, a solid
gold arch behind them blocks them from getting nailed by the
flying debris. They have to SCREAM above the HOWLING WIND.
EvY

How are we going to get out

of here!?
O'Connell spots some stairs inside the arch.

O*’ CONNELL
Follow me!

They all race into the arch and up the stairs.

EXT. PYRAMID — DAY

O'Connell, Alex, Evy, and Jonathan crawl out of a crack in
the side of the gold pyramid, about midway to the top. Their
mouths drop open as they look out and see:

THE ENTIRE OASIS IS BEING SUCKED INTO THE PYRAMID: palm
trees, bushes, shrubs, massive quantities of dirt and debris,
as well as ancient corpses and HISSING pygmy skeletons.

The pyramid itself begins to SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

O'CONNELL
This whole damn thing’s gonna
get sucked in!

O'Connell quickly looks around and then instinctively starts
running up the steps of the pyramid.

O'CONNELL
Let's go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

They all race to the top and look out: A MASSIVE WAVE OF
FOLIAGE is heading right for them, completely encircling
them, they're trapped.

EVY
Oh my God.

O'Connell wraps one arm around Evy, the other around Alex.
There is no way out. And then they hear a VOICE:

IZZ¥(o.s.)
HEY111

They all turn around, --the blimp is rising up behind them.
Izzy at the wheel.

O'CONNELL
IZZY!!

Izzy
Hurry up! I ain’t got all day!!

O’Connell hoists Alex and Evy up into the trawler and then
jumps after them. Izzy pulls a lever, SHOOTING FLAME out of
the bellow and up into a hole in the blimp. The blimp starts
to rise quickly. And that’s when Jonathan jumps. He slams
into the side of the boat, loses his grip and falls, --but
his feet get tangled in some fishing net along the side of
the boat and now he’s hanging upside down.
101

The DIAMOND TIP of the pyramid GLINTS in Jonathan's eyes.
He quickly reaches over and grabs it just as the whole damn
pyramid is SUCKED DOWN INTO THE EARTH.

CUT WIDE: The blimp rises up just as the massive wave of
foliage CRASHES DOWN, a near miss. With one last mighty ROAR,
all the foliage is SUCKED INTO THE EARTH, --WHUMP!!

And then the oasis is gone. Completely obliterated.
Everything goes dead quiet. The blimp rises above a valley
of dusty, sandy desert that was once the Oasis of Ahm Shere.

INT. BLIMP — DAY

Jonathan crashes to the floor of the boat, clinging to the
big chunk of polished. diamond that was once the tip of the
pyramid, he hugs it tightly, grinning to himself.

Evy and Alex run up and hug Izzy and thank him profusely.
Izzy is both pleased and embarrassed by all the attention.
Then he sees O’Connell slumped up against the wall of the
trawler, wincing and looking really beat-to-shit.

Izzy
O'Connell! You look like somethin’
My cat coughed up! Who the heli
you been messin’ with this time?

O'CONNELL
Oh, you know, mummies, big bugs,
pygmy skeletons, .the usual.

Izzy smiles. O’Connell smiles back, then he looks out and
sees the Medjai battlefield below. A lone rider stands out.
O'Connell steps up to the railing. Evy, Alex and Jonathan
come up and flank him. They all look down.

EXT. DUNES — DAY
Ardeth Bey sits on a horse. He smiles up at his friends in

the s. And then with an open palm he touches his heart and
waves it towards the sun.
ARDETH BEY
Harum bara shad. Thank you again,

ny friends.
EXT. BLIMP — DAY

O’Connell salutes him. Evy waves. Then O’Connell looks at
Evy.

O'CONNELL
I thought I lost you.
102

Evy
For a moment there you did.
She gives him a mischievous grin.
Evy
You want to know what heaven
looks like?
O'Connell just stares at her.

O'CONNELL
I already know.

He wraps his arms around her and they KISS.
Jonathan and Alex roll their eyes in disgust.

JONATHAN/ALEX
Oh PU-LEEEZE!

Izzy grins, turns the wheel and throttles up.
The blimp sails off into the SUNSET.

THE END
