TITLE CARD:

1756 -- THE GREAT POWERS OF THE WORLD ARE AT WAR -- FIGHTING
FOR CONTROL OF THE SEAS.

EXT. — OPEN SEA. — NORTH ATLANTIC. - DAY

A FIERCE BATTLE RAGES IN THE OPEN SEA --

CANNON FIRE SLAMS INTO THE SIDE OF A FRENCH SHIP (THE
COURAGEUX) -- FRENCH SOLDIERS BLOWN OFF THE DECK AS MORE
CANNONBALLS RIP INTO HER BELLY --

A FRENCH CAPTAIN (THUROT) IS TRYING TO MAN THE WHEEL AS AN
EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM BACK.

FRENCH SOLDIER
(in French)
SIR, WE'RE DOWN TO SIX CHARGES --

AS THE SMOKE CLEARS THE FRENCH CAPTAIN LOOKS ACRQSS AT THE
H.M.S. MONARCH -- THE MASSIVE BRITISH WAR SHIP SAILING INTO
FRAME LIKE A FLOATING SKYSCRAPER. THE MONARCH HAS 100
CANNONS AIMED AT THE COURAGEUX -- READY TO FIRE --

THE FRENCH CAPTAIN LOOKS TO HIS WOUNDED MEN -- HIS DEVASTATED
SHIP -- AND HE KNOWS IT’S OVER.

FRENCH CAPTAIN
Strike the colors.

EXT. —- H.M.S. MONARCH. — SUNSET

THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONARCH, CAPTAIN TOMS, WATCHES AS THE
FRENCH FLAG IS LOWERED -——

CAPTAIN TOMS
The surrender has been given. Prepare
to board!
INT. - FRENCH SHIP COURAGEUX. - NIGHT

BRITISH SOLDIERS HAVE BOARDED THE COURAGEUX -- THE FRENCH
WOUNDED AND DEAD DRAGGED TO THE SIDE.

A YOUNG BRITISH SOLDIER -- HENRY MADDOX (19) -- COMES UP FROM
THE HULL AND YELLS TO HIS CAPTAIN --

HENRY MADDOX
Prisoners, Sir! Civilians.

INT. — HULL OF FRENCH SHIP. — CONTINUOUS

BELOW DECK A CELL IS OPENED, AND THIRTY SCARED BRITISH
CIVILIANS ARE RELEASED FROM CAPTIVITY --
CAPTAIN TOMS
Take them aboard the Monarch and give
them provisions.

THE LAST CIVILIAN TO LEAVE THE CAGE IS A YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN HER 20’S -- OLIVIA COLE. SHE STARTS TO GO ABOVE
DECK WITH THE OTHERS. >

CAPTAIN TOMS (CONT’T -
Tell us what happened, Miss?

OLIVIA
My brother and I were sailing aboard
the Grafton to Hudson Bay when the
French ran us aground. We had secured
work in the Americas --

HENRY MADDOX
And your brother?

OLIVIA STEPS FORWARD NOW -- STARTS TO CRY. MADDOX HESITATES -
- THEN COMFORTS HER --

HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
You’re safe now, Miss. On this I
promise.

OLIVIA
Will you free the others as well?

CAPTAIN TOMS
Others?

OLIVIA
Below.

INT. - BOTTOM HULL. - DAY

CAPTAIN TOMS WALKS DOWN INTO THE DARK BILGE AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE FRENCH SHIP -- HIS MEN LEADING HIM -- HENRY MADDOX AND
OLIVIA CLOSE BEHIND.

OLIVIA
I could hear their screams at night,
Sir. But then it stopped.

IN THE DARKEST CORNER OF THE SHIP THERE ARE FOUR CAGES -- THE
STENCH IMMEDIATELY HITTING THEM ALL --

CAPTAIN TOMS
Dead animals?

THE CAGES NOW ILLUMINATED BY LANTERNS -- AND CAPTAIN TOMS
SEES A GLIMPSE OF WHAT IS INSIDE.
HENRY MADDOX
No, Sir. Witches. Four witches in
cages. Their throats slashed.

OLIVIA SCARED NOW ——

OLIVIA
Why were they here?

CAPTAIN TOMS
The French are losing the war -- their
people starved. These witches were
tortured -- forced to search for
treasure.

HENRY MADDOX
Then why were they killed?

CAPTAIN TOMS WALKS TOWARD A HUGE IRON VAULT THAT HAS B&EN
BUILT INTO THE HULL.

CAPTAIN TOMS
Perhaps they found what they were
looking for.

THE VAULT DOORS ARE BLOWN OPEN WITH GUNPOWDER. AS THE SMOKE
CLEARS WE SEE A SMALL WOODEN BOX INSIDE.

CAPTAIN TOMS TAKES THE ANCIENT BOX AND SLOWLY OPENS IT.
INSIDE THERE IS A LARGE YELLOW DIAMOND -- ITS COLOR AS RICH
AS GOLD -- ITS UNUSUAL EYE SHAPE GIVING THE ILLUSION THAT THE
DIAMOND IS STARING BACK AT HIM.

CAPTAIN TOMS (CONT’D)
The Eye of Poseidon. Legend says it
once held its place in the center of
the Trident.

BRITISH SOLDIER
The Trident of Poseidon?

CAPTAIN TOMS STARES AT THE EYE --

CAPTAIN TOMS
Imagine a Navy that could never be
defeated. A nation that could never
be conquered. To hold the Trident is
to control more than the sea. It is
to control the world.

WITCH
The Trident exists -- hidden where no
Man can see.

ONE OF THE WITCHES IS ALIVE INSIDE HER CAGE. SHE’S HALF DEAD
-- LOOKING UP AT CAPTAIN TOMS --
WITCH (CONT’D)
Only The Eye can show you the way.

THE WITCH MOVES FORWARD IN HER CAGE -- LOOKS UP AT TOMS AND
SMILES.

WITCH (CONT'D)
A storm comes for you now. ‘Tis time,
Captain. ‘Tis time to die.

A SINGLE SHOT IS FIRED INTO THE DARKNESS -- THE WITCH IS
KILLED IN HER CAGE. AND CAPTAIN TOMS HOLSTERS HIS WEAPON --

EXT. - H.M.S. MONARCH. - NIGHT

A HEAVY STORM LASHES THE MONARCH, WHICH SAILS FOR HOME
THROUGH ROUGH SEAS. CAPTAIN TOMS IS ON DECK WATH H&3 CREW --
WAVES CRASHING OVER THE SIDES AS THEY FIGHT THE @m™-r* —

FIRST MATE
We've been blown off course, Sir!

INT. — HULL OF MONARCH. — CONTINUOUS

DOWN IN THE HULL ALL OF THE FREED PRISONERS ARE RIDING OUT
THE STORM. HENRY MADDOX WALKS TOWARD OLIVIA, WHO SITS ALONE.
HE HANDS HER SOME BREAD.

HENRY MADDOX
Miss -- you should eat something.

OLIVIA
Thank you, Sir.

HENRY MADDOX
Sir? No, Miss, I’m no officer. My
name is Henry Maddox -- Captain's
servant for now.

OLIVIA
Olivia Cole.

THE SHIP IS ROCKED BY A HUGE WA 7

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Henry, are you not afraid of the
storm?

HENRY MADDOX
I’m not scared of anything, Miss.
They call me “Lucky” Maddox, because
not a single man has died since I’ve
come aboard.

OLIVIA
Maybe they’re the lucky ones.
SHE REACHES OUT AND TAKES HIS HAND -- LOOKS AT THE SCARS.
OLIVIA (CONT’D)
These scars are from a sickle. What
kind of farm do you come from?

HENRY MADDOX
We had clover and turnips.

AND NOW SHE SHOWS SHOW HIM HER OWN HANDS -- WHICH HAVE THE
SAME SCARS.

OLIVIA
Barley and wheat.

HENRY MADDOX
Do you miss the harvest?

OLIVIA
I dream about it all the time.

HENRY MADDOX
Then we dream together.

SHE LOOKS DOWN -- REALIZES SHE’S STILL HOLDING HIS HAND -—-
HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
You’re not alone, Olivia. I’11
protect you. If you like.
SHE LETS GO OF HIS HAND NOW -- HIDES A SMILE.

OLIVIA
You carry no weapon.

HENRY MADDOX
It's my first season on the Monarch.
Next month I get my irons.

OLIVIA
Then how could you ever defend me?

HENRY MADDOX
I told you. I’m Lucky.

SUDDENLY THE SHIP GETS ROCKED BY A HUGE WAVE -- EVERYONE A
BIT CONCERNED.

EXT. - MONARCH TOP DECK. - NIGHT
WAVES BATTERING THE SHIP -- CAPTAIN TOMS AT THE WHEEL --
CAPTAIN TOMS

It’s not the wind. It’s the current.
She’s pulling us in!
FIRST MATE
Into what, Sir?

CAPTAIN TOMS
Into there.

THROUGH THE STORM WE SEE TWO LARGE ROCK FORMATIONS STANDING
GUARD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA. A THICK, HEAVY FOG STANDS
LIKE A DOOR BETWEEN THE TWO ROCKS --

AS LIGHTNING FLASHES --
WE SEE A MASSIVE BODY OF WATER LIT WITH A CRACKLING FLASH --

FIRST MATE
THE DEVIL’S TRIANGLE!

CAPTAIN TOMS
ALL HANDS!!

NOW ALL THE SOLDIERS ON DECK FURIOUSLY WORKING TOGETHER TO
TRY AND KEEP THE MONARCH FROM SAILING INTO THE TRIANGLE -—

BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY -- THE SHIP IS PUSHED INTO
THE FOG BETWEEN THE TWO ROCKS --

THE CREW WATCHING AS THE MONARCH SAILS IN. SUDDENLY
EVERYTHING IS CALM -- THE FOG REMAINS THICK AND OMINOUS. THE
MEN UNEASY NOW -- LOOKING DOWN AT THE WATER -- WHICH SEEMS TO
BE BLOOD RED AND BUBBLING -- STEAM RISING FROM THE SURFACE -—
AS IF THEY HAD SAILED INTO THE GATES OF HELL --

BRITISH SOLDIER
Ship off the bow!

CAPTAIN TOMS
That’s no ship. It’s a shipwreck.

THROUGH THE FOG AND STEAM A SHIPWRECK APPEARS -- THE BOAT
TORN APART -- THE HULL EXPOSED LIKE A GUTTED FISH. ONLY THIS
SHIPWRECK IS ABOVE WATER -- AND SOMEHOW IT’S NOT SINKING.
THIS IS THE SILENT MARY --

AT FIRST IT SEEMS TO BE DRIFTING -- BUT THEN WE REALIZE THIS
SHIPWRECK IS SAILING WITHOUT SAILS --—

FIRST MATE
SHE’S COMING RIGHT AT US!!

BRITISH SOLDIERS SCRAMBLING --

CAPTAIN TOMS
PREPARE TO FIGHT!!

AND NOW THE SHIP SAILS STRAIGHT THROUGH THEM -- MEN ON DECK
BRACING FOR IMPACT -- BUT THE IMPACT NEVER COMES.
THE SOLDIERS TERRIFIED NOW -- WATCH AS THE SHIP SAILS
STRAIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE.

FIRST MATE
Sir?

CAPTAIN TOMS
Prepare the cannons!

INT. - HULL OF MONARCH. - CONTINUOUS

CAPTAIN TOMS COMES DOWN THE STAIRS -- HIS TERRIFIED SOLDIERS
STAND AND FACE HIM --

CAPTAIN TOMS
What are you waiting for! Ready the
guns!

THE MEN DON’T MOVE. NOISES ARE HEARD -— CREAKING SOUNDS.
HENRY MADDOX STANDS WITH OLIVIA IN THE SHADOWS -- WATCHING.

HENRY MADDOX
Olivia, wait here. Don’t move.

DEAD SILENCE. ONE OF THE OLDER SOLDIERS STEPS BACK.

OLD SOLDIER
They say to enter these waters is to
enter the gates of hell.

CAPTAIN TOMS
I’LL HAVE NO TALK OF THAT!

MORE NOISES NOW -- AS IF SOMEONE IS WALKING ON THE DECK ABOVE
THEM. THE LANTERNS GO OUT ON THEIR OWN -- THE MEN CLEARLY
HORRIFIED --

CAPTAIN TOMS (CONT’D)
Take position.

THE SOLDIERS PUSH THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALLS -- SWEAT
DRIPPING FROM THEIR FACES AS THEY HOLD THEIR WEAPONS -—
LOOKING TO THE STAIRS AND WAITING --

THE CREAKING SOUND MOVING DOWN THE MAIN STAIRS -- ALL EYES
LOOKING INTO THE DARKNESS -- WAITING -- AS A SHADOW APPEARS -——

THE SOLDIERS READY TO FIRE -—

AS A CAT COMES DOWN THE STAIRS -- LOOKS AT THE MEN AND
SCAMPERS OFF. THE MEN RELIEVED -- NOTHING MORE THAN A CAT --

SUDDENLY A PAIR OF HANDS COMES THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP -
- HANDS AND ARMS REACHING FOR A SOLDIER AND GRABBING HIS
THROAT --
THE SOLDIER SCREAMING -- FIRING HIS WEAPON STRAIGHT INTO
ANOTHER SOLDIER --

MORE HANDS COMING THROUGH NOW -- WE DON’T SEE ANY HEADS OR
BODIES -- JUST HANDS AND ARMS COMING THROUGH THE FLOOR --
THROUGH THE CEILING -- AND NOW HANDS ARE EVERYWHERE --

GRABBING NECKS TO BREAK -- CUTTING THROATS -- SOLDIERS FIRING
THEIR GUNS -- SHOOTING EACH OTHER AS BULLETS PIERCE THE HULL -—

HENRY RUNNING NOW -- MOVING TOWARD OLIVIA WHO IS FROZEN WITH
FEAR. HE GRABS HER AND PULLS HER THROUGH THE SHIP -—

WATER POURING INTO THE SHIP -- HANDS COMING FROM ALL
DIRECTIONS NOW AS MEN ARE THROWN VIOLENTLY INTO THE SIDE OF
THE SHIP -- OTHERS GETTING CHOKED WHERE THEY STAND. CAPTAIN

TOMS TURNS TO FIGHT -- RUNS RIGHT INTO A SWORD --
HENRY PULLING OLIVIA TOWARD THE BACK STAIRS.

OLIVIA
What’s happening!!

HENRY MADDOX
Come with me!

EXT. — MONARCH. - NIGHT

AS SOLDIERS ARE ATTACKED ALL AROUND THEM, HENRY AND OLIVIA
ARE RUNNING TO THE STERN OF THE MONARCH. HENRY GLANCES BACK -
- KNOWS THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME --—

HENRY MADDOX
YOU HAVE TO GET OFF THE SHIP!

HENRY GRABS THE TOP OF A BARREL -- THROWS IT INTO THE OCEAN -——

HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
GO NOW. I’M GOING TO DISTRACT THEM.

HENRY LOOKS BACK -- SEES A SOLDIER DROP TO THE DECK -- AND A
MAN LOOKS TOWARD HIM -- A MAN WITH A BULLET HOLE IN HIS HEAD.

OLIVIA
WE HAVE TO GO TOGETHER! !

HENRY MADDOX
GET AS FAR AWAY AS YOU CAN!!

OLIVIA
HENRY -- PROMISE YOU'LL FIND ME!

HENRY MADDOX
YOU HAVE MY WORD.
AND NOW HENRY TAKES OLIVIA AND THROWS HER OFF THE BACK OF THE
SHIP. SHE LANDS IN THE WATER -- GRABS FOR THE TOP OF THE
BARREL LID AND PULLS HERSELF UP --

HE WATCHES AS SHE FLOATS OVER THE WAVES -- THEIR EYES LOCKED
ON EACH OTHER FOR A BEAT -—

HENRY TURNS BACK TO THE SHIP -- THE MAN WITH THE BULLET HOLE
IS COMING TOWARD HIM -- AND HENRY TAKES OFF RUNNING -- MOVING
QUICKLY ACROSS THE SHIP AND UNDER THE SAILS AS HE SPRINTS IN
A WILD BLUR TOWARD THE BOW --

WHERE FOUR GHOSTS STAND AND WAIT FOR HIM --

AS HE TURNS BACK HE RUNS STRAIGHT INTO FOUR MORE -- THE BOY
SURROUNDED NOW -- TERRIFIED -- NO PLACE TO RUN.

GHOST
The last one.

INT. - MONARCH HULL. - CONTINUOUS

WE SEE THE GHOST OF CAPTAIN JOHN BRAND STANDING OVER THE
WOODEN BOX -- HIS BACK TO US -- HIS FACE HIDDEN IN THE
SHADOWS. HE SLOWLY REACHES IN -- PULLS OUT THE YELLOW
DIAMOND -- HOLDS “THE EYE” UP TO THE LIGHT --

CAPTAIN BRAND
The Eye has come home.

HENRY MADDOX IS BROUGHT DOWNSTAIRS BY THE GHOSTS -- AND
CAPTAIN BRAND SLOWLY WALKS TOWARD HIM --

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
No need to be afraid, boy.

HENRY GLANCES OUT A GUNNER’S WINDOW -- SEES OLIVIA FLOATING
AWAY FROM THE SHIP --

AS CAPTAIN BRAND MOVES TOWARD HIM -- FACE STILL HIDDEN -- BUT
WE CAN SEE HIS THROAT HAS BEEN CUT. HIS VOICE IS STRAINED
AND HORRIFYING -- A BLOODY HANGER SWORD IN HIS HAND.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Today is your lucky day. I always
keep one man alive.
BEHIND CAPTAIN BRAND WE SEE THAT ALL OF HIS DEAD MEN HAVE
BEEN ASSEMBLED -- THE GHOSTS ALL LINED UP BEHIND HIM IN THE
DARKNESS.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
One man to tell the tale.

TITLE UP:

DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
10.

INT. - SAINT MARTIN. - DAY

A BUSY CARIBBEAN ISLAND -- MEN IN SUITS AND WOMEN WITH
PARASOLS. A DISTINGUISHED CROWD HAS FORMED IN THE MIDDLE OF
SAINT MARTIN -- EVERYONE WATCHING AS THE MAYOR STANDS IN
FRONT OF THE ROYAL BANK.

MAYOR
Today we dedicate the Royal Bank of
Saint Martin -- the most secure

banking institution in the Caribbean.
BEHIND THE BANK -- GUARDS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED COLD --

PIRATES ARE USING ROPES TO PULL THEMSELVES UP TOWARD A SMALL
WINDOW AT THE BACK OF THE BANK --

MAYOR (CONT'D)
Our new vault is made from crucible
steel. She is five inches thick --
stands as tall as any man and weighs
an imperial ton. She will never be
stolen or robbed --

THE PIRATES MAKE IT THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW --

INSIDE THE BANK -- THE PIRATES DESCEND ON THE MASSIVE VAULT
IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. THEY TIE ROPES TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE VAULT -- QUICKLY MOVE TOWARD A SMALL HOLE THAT HAS BEEN
CUT INTO THE BACK OF THE BANK --

ROPES ARE FED THROUGH THE HOLE -- WHILE OUTSIDE THE BANK -——

GIBBS AND SCRUM EACH GRAB THE ROPES -- QUICKLY MOVE TOWARD
HORSE AND CARRIAGE -- FOUR TEAMS WAITING --

MAYOR (CONT'D)
The Governor has placed his personal
gold reserves inside this new branch --
a bank protected by the Royal Guard!

PIRATES ARE TYING ROPES TO FOUR CARRIAGES --

MAYOR (CONT'D)
With the opening of this bank -- we
enter the modern world!

AS THE BANK DOORS OPEN AND A BAND STARTS TO PLAY --

THE PIRATES SMACK THEIR HORSES -- ROPES PULLED TIGHT FROM THE
CARRIAGES TO THE BACK OF THE BANK --

GIBBS AND SCRUM AT THE REINS OF THE LEAD WAGON --
HORSES INCHING FORWARD -- STRAINING AS THE ROPES PULL TIGHT --

INSIDE THE BANK WE SEE THE ROPES TIGHTEN AROUND THE VAULT --
11.

BUT THE VAULT DOESN’T MOVE --

GIBBS
SHE WON’T BUDGE!!

WE SUDDENLY SEE JACK SPARROW STANDING ON THE ROOF OF THE BANK
-- PISTOL IN ONE HAND -- A JUG OF RUM IN THE OTHER AS HE
YELLS DOWN TO THE PEOPLE OF SAINT MARTIN.
JACK SPARROW
Excuse me. If I could have your
attention for just one moment.
THE CROWD REACTING AS JACK STEPS TO THE EDGE OF THE ROOF --
JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
I was wondering if you wouldn’t mind
helping me to rob this bank.

TEN GUNS ARE IMMEDIATELY POINTED UP AT JACK -- THE ROYAL
GUARD TAKING POSITION.

MAYOR
You are a mile from the sea, Pirate!
Lower your weapon or you will be shot.

JACK SPARROW
Being shot will do just fine.

JACK FIRES A SINGLE SHOT INTO THE AIR --
THE ROYAL GUARD OPENING FIRE AS JACK DIVES BACK ON THE ROOF

ALL OF THE HORSES SPOOKED BY THE GUNFIRE -- FOUR TEAMS OF
HORSES REARING UP NOW -- PULLING HARD --

AS THE VAULT SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR OF THE BANK -- SLAMS
HARD INTO THE BACK DOORS --

MAYOR
WHAT’S HAPPENING! !

JACK SPARROW
We're taking the vault.

BUT THE VAULT IS TOO BIG -- GETS CAUGHT BETWEEN THE IRON
DOORS -- STUCK INSIDE THE BANK --

HORSES STRAINING -- PULLING WITH ALL THEY’VE GOT --
JACK ON THE ROOF -- FEELS THE VIBRATION UNDERNEATH HIM --

MORE SHOTS FIRED -- AND JACK SUDDENLY REALIZES WHAT’S ABOUT
TO HAPPEN --

AS WOODEN CORNER SUPPORTS SHATTER AROUND THE BANK --
12.
AND NOW THE ENTIRE BUILDING STARTS TO MOVE AS THE BANK IS
PULLED INTO THE STREET BEHIND THE BANK --

PEOPLE DIVING OUT OF THE WAY AS THE BANK SLIDES THROUGH THE
MIDDLE OF TOWN --

PIRATES AT THE HELM OF THE WAGONS -- ALL OF THEM URGING THEIR
HORSES FORWARD --

AS THE BUILDING STARTS TO PICK UP SPEED --
THE ROYAL GUARD CHASING THE BANK -- STARTS TO OPEN FIRE --
THE ROPES TIGHT AND PULLING THE BUILDING FASTER AND FASTER --

MAYOR
THEY’RE STEALING THE BANK!!

JACK TOSSED AROUND ON THE ROOF -- TRYING TO STAY ON HIS FEET -

THE HORSES TURNING A SHARP CORNER -- HALF THE BANK CRASHING
INTO ANOTHER BUILDING --

WALLS CRASHING AND CRUMBLING AS THE ROOF CAVES IN --
AND JACK DROPS STRAIGHT DOWN -- LANDS ON TOP OF THE VAULT --

THE PIRATES PICKING UP SPEED AS THEY PULL THE BANK OUT OF
TOWN -- ABOUT TO RIDE UNDER A STONE BRIDGE CROSS ROAD --

JACK SEEING THE BRIDGE UP AHEAD -- REALIZES THE BANK WON’T
CLEAR THE CROSS ROAD --

JACK SPARROW
Bridge. BRIDGE!!!

THE HORSES SPEED UNDER THE BRIDGE WHILE THE BANK SLAMS INTO
It --

JACK JUMPING TO BRIDGE -- RUNNING ACROSS AS THE ENTIRE
BUILDING GETS STUCK IN THE OPENING --

THE VAULT CRASHING THROUGH THE BANK WALL AND POPPING OUT THE
OTHER SIDE --

AS JACK JUMPS OFF THE BACK OF THE BRIDGE AND LANDS ON TOP OF
THE VAULT -- THE HORSES PULLING IT TOWARD THE DISTANT SEA.

AS THE ROYAL GUARD PULLS UP TO THE BRIDGE -- SEES THEIR
MANGLED BANK CRUMBLED UP INSIDE THE OPENING -- BLOCKING THE
ONLY ROAD OUT OF TOWN.

EXT. - JACK’S SHIP (THE DYING GULL). - LATER THAT DAY

THE VAULT IS NOW SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY SMALL,
DILAPIDATED SHIP -- A SHIP WHICH RESEMBLES A FLOATING BARGE.
13.

THE SAILS ARE TORN AND THE MEN ARE JAMMED TOGETHER LIKE
SARDINES. NOBODY MOVES AS A FUSE IS LIT AND THE VAULT DOOR
IS BLOWN OPEN.

AS THE SMOKE CLEARS JACK SLOWLY REACHES IN -- PULLS OUT A
SINGLE GOLD COIN. HE TURNS TO SEE HIS CREW STARING AT HIM.

JACK SPARROW
I told you robbing a bank would be
easy.

JACK MAKES HIS WAY BACK TO THE WHEEL OF HIS SHIP -- LOOKS OUT
AT THE HORIZON.

PIRATE #2
You promised each of us a bar of gold.
It’s been months since we've seen any
spoils, Captain.

JACK QUICKLY POCKETS THE SINGLE GOLD COIN --

JACK SPARROW
Am I to be blamed for the monetary
failures of the men I steal from? Now
line up so I may collect your daily
tribute.

PIRATE #2
Tribute? We're starved, Captain.
Yesterday we ate a rat.

JACK SPARROW
It was a very big rat. Luckily the
ship is overrun with them -- and I
charge very little for each.

SCRUM
They are quite tasty.

PIRATE #3
I‘ll pay no tribute! We’ll never find
treasure on a ship such as this.

PIRATE #2
I hear the pirate William Kidd is
looking for hands -- has a ship with a
hundred cannons.

PIRATE #3
Not to mention his balls -- 18 pounds

each they say!

JACK SPARROW
Well -- it’s not the size that
matters.
14.

PIRATE #2
We’re down to three cannonballs. Face
it, Captain, your luck has run
aground.

THE MEN SLOWLY MOVE TOWARD JACK WITH WEAPONS IN HAND -- GUNS
AND KNIVES --

JACK SPARROW
Let me remind you all that without me
you'd all be poor, destitute, unwanted
miscreants.

GIBBS
Jack, even with you we appear to be
poor, destitute, unwanted miscreants.

JACK SPARROW
Then I guess my secret must be shared.

PIRATE #2
Secret?

JACK SPARROW
There’s a treasure in Port Royal that
will change our fortunes forever. I
can’t speak its name -- as it has yet
to come to me -- but there will soon
be jewels stuffed in every man’s
pockets. And those of you without
pockets can shove them somewhere else.

PIRATE #2
Jewels?

JACK SPARROW
Diamonds! Or my name isn’t Captain
Jack Sparrow.

THE MEN CHEER NOW -- JUST AS A RAT SCURRIES BY ON DECK.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
That one’s on me.

THE MEN RUSH OFF AS JACK TURNS BACK TO THE WHEEL. GIBBS
STEPS UP NEXT TO HIM.

GIBBS
Sir, I fear you’re about to lose
command of this rotting ship. Perhaps
it’s time to go ashore.

JACK SPARROW
Ashore?
15.

GIBBS
Just for a year or two. It was a good
run, Jack -- but it would seem your

luck has turned.
THIS IS HARD FOR GIBBS TO SAY.

GIBS
It’s over, Captain.

JACK HOLDS UP THE BLACK PEARL -- WHICH IS STILL TRAPPED
INSIDE THE BOTTLE.

JACK SPARROW
Nothing is over, Mr. Gibbs. All I
need is my ship to put things right.

GIBBS
You've spent years trying to free the
Pearl from her bottle -- rubbed magic

oils from Cape Raye and sorcerer's
salt from Pimlico! You even danced
naked in Dove’s Cove.

JACK SPARROW
Dove's Cove had nothing to do with the
Pearl. I just felt like dancing.

JACK TURNS TO GIBBS NOW -——

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
You say it’s over. I say it’s time to
knock on a Red Door in Port Royal.

GIBBS
A Red Door? No, Jack -- that witch
talks to the devil himself.

JACK SPARROW
I have no choice, Gibbs. I can’t be
Captain Jack Sparrow without my ship.
And I can’t have my ship without a
witch.

EXT. - PORT ROYAL. - KINGSTON HARBOR. - DAY

A BRITISH ARMY WAGON ROLLS BY FULL OF WOMEN -- LOCAL
“WITCHES” ROUNDED UP AND HEADING FOR THE JAILS. SOLDIERS ON
FOOT TRAILING THE WAGON -——

BRITISH SOLDIER
Witches of Port Royal, by order of
Admiral Scarfield turn yourselves in.
No good will come from hiding -- you
will be found by the British Navy.
16.

THE WAGON PASSES BY CARINA SMYTH (29, BEAUTIFUL) AS SHE
EMERGES FROM BETWEEN TWO BUILDINGS. SHE IS HIDING IN THE
SHADOWS -- A WOMAN ON THE RUN.

CARINA WEARS A PLAIN WHITE DRESS -- NO GLOVES OR HAT -—- AND
QUICKLY MOVES THROUGH TOWN UNTIL SHE STOPS IN FRONT OF A
SHOP. THE SIGN READS: SWIFT’S CHART HOUSE.

AND UNDERNEATH -- NO DOGS, SLAVES OR WOMEN ALLOWED

CARINA GLANCES IN THE WINDOW -- THE PLACE IS SWIMMING WITH
MAPS. CHARTS. SHIPS LOGS, ALL PILED FLOOR TO CEILING.

INT. — SWIFT’S CHART HOUSE. - DAY

CARINA SLOWLY WALKS IN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE STORE -- LOOKS
AROUND LIKE A KID IN A CANDY SHOP.

MR. SWIFT
Did you not see the sign, Miss?

MR. SWIFT (FAT AND REPELLENT) STEPS AWAY FROM A GIANT MAP
HE’S WORKING ON AND SLOWLY WALKS TOWARD HER.

CARINA SMYTH
Sir, I require a lens. One strong
enough to capture Venus.
AND NOW SWIFT RECOGNIZES HER --
MR. SWIFT
You. They're looking for you. You’re
one of them!

CARINA SMYTH

No. Please -- I can pay you --
CARINA TAKES OUT SOME COINS -- SETS THEM ON THE COUNTER --
MR. SWIFT

WITCH! THERE’S A WITCH IN MY STORE!!!

AS SWIFT RUSHES TO THE BACK OF HIS STORE CARINA QUICKLY TURNS
TOWARD A SHELF -- FINDS A SEXTANT TELESCOPE -- NOT SURE WHERE
TO PUT IT -- ENDS UP SHOVING IT INSIDE HER DRESS. SHE IS
ABOUT TO LEAVE WHEN SHE SPOTS A LARGE TELESCOPE FACING OUT
THE WINDOW --

SHE LOOKS THROUGH THE LENS FOR A BEAT -- THEN SLOWLY MOVES
THE TELESCOPE A QUARTER INCH TO THE RIGHT --

MR. SWIFT (CONT'D)
STOP!!

CARINA STEPS BACK AS MR. SWIFT COMES OUT FROM THE BACK --
AIMS A GUN AT HER --
17.

MR. SWIFT (CONT'D)
What do you think you’re doing? That
telescope was made by --

CARINA SMYTH
Sir Frederick Herschel. I know.

THE GUN IS SHAKING IN SWIFT’S HAND -- HIS FACE FULL OF RAGE.

MR. SWIFT
No woman has ever touched my Herschel.

CARINA SMYTH
With apologies, Sir. Your celestial
fix is slightly off. I moved it two
degrees North.

MR. SWIFT
You -- you -- what!?

CARINA SMYTH
Which means that map you've almost
completed -- I’m afraid you'll have to
start over.

SWIFT GLANCES BACK AT HIS MAP -- WHICH COVERS AN ENTIRE WALL.
WHILE HE’S DISTRACTED CARINA QUICKLY RUSHES PAST HIM INTO THE
STREET --

MR. SWIFT
Start over...

EXT. - SWIFT’S. - CONTINUOUS

CARINA RUSHES INTO THE STREET, WHERE SEVERAL BRITISH SOLDIERS
ARE WAITING FOR HER -- INCLUDING ADMIRAL SCARFIELD. HE GRABS
HER, PLACES A GUN AT HER HEAD.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
Carina Smyth -- you will never again
cast black magic toward the sky.

CARINA SMYTH
Black magic? You must be mistaken,
Sir. I sew uniforms for the
haberdasher each day --

THE SEXTANT DROPS FROM HER DRESS -- SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.
ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
I will see you die, witch. Put her in
the wagon!

CARINA SMYTH
Sir, please, let me explain!

THE MEN GRAB CARINA -- DRAG HER OFF TO THE WAGON.
18.

EXT. - BARBOSSA’S SHIP (QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE). - DAY

THE QUEEN ANNE IS OVERFLOWING WITH SPOILS -- STATUES AND
PORCELAIN BOWLS -- SILK SCARVES AND RUGS STACKED ON THE DECK.

BARBOSSA’S MEN HAVE DOCKED IN ST. JAMES -- THE PIRATES
CELEBRATING THEIR LATEST CONQUEST --

TWO PIRATES FIGHT OVER A PAIR OF CANDLE STICKS --

ANOTHER PIRATE IS URINATING IN A CHINESE VASE --

THE MEN ARE EATING LIKE KINGS AND DRINKING FROM BARRELS --
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF JACK’S SHIP --

INT. — CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS. - QUEEN ANNE’S. -— CONTINUOUS

BARBOSSA SITS ALONE AT HIS DESK QUIETLY SETTLING ACCOUNTS --
A STACK OF SILVER COINS IN FRONT OF HIM TO BE COUNTED.

HIS QUARTERS ARE FULL OF STOLEN GOODS FROM EVERY CORNER OF
THE WORLD -- AND HE CAN HEAR THE MEN CELEBRATING ON DECK -——

BARBOSSA OPENS A DRAWER TO FIND A FEATHERED PEN -- PULLS OUT
A SMALL PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN. THE PAINTING IS CREASED AND
CRACKED -- FITS IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND. THE WOMAN IS DARK-—

HAIRED, BEAUTIFUL -- CLEARLY A GHOST FROM HIS PAST.
HE LOOKS AT THE PORTRAIT FOR A BEAT -- THEN SETS IT BACK IN
THE DRAWER AS HIS DOOR OPENS.
PINTEL
Sir, we know you said never to disturb
you --
RAGETTI

Or to come in without good cause --

PINTEL
Or to speak without first asking
ourselves if our thoughts were
absolutely necessary --

RAGETTI
Like the ship being on fire -- you'd
want to know that.

PINTEL
But it’s not on fire -- that being an
example of a necessary thought.

THE TWO MEN ARE SUDDENLY THROWN AGAINST THE WALL -—- PINNED
BACK FROM THE FORCE OF BLACKBEARD’S SWORD -- WHICH IS OUT AND
POINTED AT THEM -—
19.

BARBOSSA
STATE YOUR BUSINESS BEFORE I OPEN YOUR
THROATS!

RAGETTI
We just come from town, Sir. The
British are enraged -- rounding up
pirates and witches as they wish. In
no time they'll find their way to the
Queen Anne.

PINTEL
It seems one of their ships went
missing. The Monarch lost to the
Triangle -- a full crew murdered at
sea.

BARBOSSA
And how do they know this?

PINTEL
A survivor, Sir. One man lived to
tell the tale.

AND NOW BARBOSSA LOOKS AT THEM -- HIS WHEELS SPINNING.

BARBOSSA
Where is he?

EXT. —- PORT ROYAL. - NIGHT

THE SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF PORT ROYAL HAS COME ALIVE AT NIGHT --
WITH DERELICTS, WHORES AND DRUNKS ALL OVER THE BEACH. JACK
AND SCRUM MAKE THEIR WAY UNDER THE DOCKS, MOVE PAST A SERIES
OF SHACKS UNTIL THEY SEE ONE WITH A BLOOD RED DOOR.

THEY BOTH STOP -- CLEARLY NERVOUS --

JACK SPARROW
The red door. Doesn’t look so bad,
Scrum. You go first.

SCRUM
Jack, I don’t keep company with
witches. All of them covered in warts
and boils. Makes me miss my Mum.

JACK SPARROW
Your mother was a witch?

SCRUM
Just incredibly ugly.

JACK SPARROW
Nothing to be afraid of, Scrum.
Except that two-headed dog.
20.

A TWO-HEADED DOG IS GROWLING AT THEM BY THE RED DOOR --

SCRUM
I’m not going in there. Even the
Redcoats are afraid to touch her.
Let’s escape before it’s too late.

SUDDENLY THE DOOR TO THE SHACK SLOWLY OPENS ON ITS OWN --

JACK SPARROW
I believe it’s too late to be too
late.

AND JACK AND SCRUM STARE IN AT MELIA -- A YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL
NAKED WOMAN HIDING IN THE SHADOWS BY THE FIRELIGHT. HER LONG
HAIR COVERS HER BODY AS SHE POURS A CUP OF TEA FROM A KETTLE.

MELIA
I've been expecting you, Jack Sparrow.
Would you like some tea?

SCRUM AND JACK STARE IN AT MELIA -- A VISION OF FEMALE
PERFECTION.

SCRUM
I could go for a spot of tea.

AND SCRUM LEADS THE WAY INSIDE.

INT. - MELIA’S SHACK. - NIGHT

SCRUM AND JACK MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARD MELIA -- THE LIGHT FROM
THE FIRE CASTING A GLOW ACROSS HER BEAUTIFUL FACE AND HIDDEN
BODY.

JACK SPARROW
I’ve brought you some gold.

JACK HOLDS UP THE ONE GOLD COIN --
MELIA PULLS OUT A SHARP KNIFE AND SLOWLY MOVES TOWARD THEM.

SHE CUTS HER OWN HAND -- LETS THE BLOOD DRIP INTO THE POT OF
BOILING WATER -- WHICH IMMEDIATELY FLAMES UP --

SCRUM
On second thought -- I’1l pass on the
tea.

MELIA

Each time I cast a spell it cost me a
piece of myself. This is the price I
pay for stepping to the other side.
The question is -- what price will you
pay to be Captain of the Pearl again?

JACK SPARROW
Name it and I shall pay it.
21.

MELIA STEPS CLOSER -- TAKES THE KNIFE AND CUTS JACK’S FINGER.

MELIA
Your blood. This is the price you
agreed to pay when you came through my
red door.

SHE GETS CLOSE TO JACK NOW -- TASTES THE BLOOD ON HIS FINGER.

JACK SPARROW
Might explain why you’re not very
busy.

SHE LOOKS AT THE PEARL -- THE SHIP FLOATING INSIDE THE
BOTTLE.

MELIA
My powers are not strong enough.
You’re the one who will free the
Pearl.

JACK SPARROW
Me?

MELIA
It will be free when you find the
Trident of Poseidon.

JACK SPARROW
Hard to find something when you’re not
looking for it.

MELIA
But you are -- you just don’t know it
yet. You will find The Map No Man Can
Read -- which will lead you inside the
Devil’s Triangle. This is where the
Trident lies.

SCRUM
Jack -- did she say Devil’s --

JACK SPARROW
Time to go!

JACK AND SCRUM QUICKLY RUSHING TO LEAVE -- BUT THE DOOR SLAMS
SHUT IN FRONT OF THEM.

MELIA
You are wise to fear the Triangle.
Captain Brand remains where you left
him. Waiting 16 years to take the
life that took his own.

JACK TURNS TO HER NOW -- MORE THAN A BIT CONCERNED.
22.

JACK SPARROW
Has it been 16 years? I’11 bet he’s
forgotten all about me --

MELIA’S POT BOILING OVER NOW -- AND IN THE SEETHING WATER
THEY SUDDENLY SEE WHAT SHE SEES -- TWO SMALL SHIPS FIGHTING
INSIDE THE POT -- A BATTLE TAKING PLACE.

MELIA
This is a battle from your past. You
sank his ship -- left him to sink
beneath the gates of hell --
imprisoned in the triangle. And like
all who die there, his spirit will not
rest until he has his revenge.

JACK SPARROW
He'll have to wait a bit longer -- as
I have no plans to visit.

MELIA
You have no choice. If you want to
live.
IN HER POT WE SUDDENLY SEE THE EYE -- THE YELLOW EYE STARING

BACK AT THEM.

MELIA (CONT'D)

The dead Captain holds The Eye of
Poseidon -- the key to finding the
Trident. And with the Trident -- he
will finally be free.

JACK SPARROW
Free? Metaphorically?

MELIA
Free to take his revenge on you. Your
only hope is to find the Trident
before he does.

JACK SPARROW
So let me get this straight. You're
saying the only way for me to live, is
to sail into the one place on earth I
am sure to die?

MELIA
The Devil’s Triangle is your destiny.

JACK SPARROW
Sorry -- don’t believe in destiny.
Gets in the way of opportunity.
SHE WALKS

23.

MELIA
There is no escaping it. Tonight you
will be married, have two children,
and kill 46 men in cold blood.

SCRUM
Going to be a busy night.

MELIA
You came here to save a ship, to save
your name. But your only hope is to
save your life.

JACK SPARROW
And if I refuse to chase the ghosts of
my past?

OVER -- DRAWS JACK’S SWORD FROM HIS BELT.
MELIA

Then Brand will use this sword to cut
your throat.

THE DOOR OPENS BEHIND THEM NOW.

MELIA (CONT'D)
Your destiny is sealed, Jack Sparrow.
Find the Trident or die.

EXT. —- PORT ROYAL. - NIGHT

JACK AND SCRUM RUSH OUT OF MELIA’S SHACK -- BOTH A BIT
RATTLED AS THEY LOOK UP AT THE MOON.

SCRUM
We never should have gone there, Jack.
We have to find The Map No Man Can
Read, which you're already looking for
-- but just don’t know it.

JACK SPARROW
If I can’t read it, then why would I
look for it?

SCRUM
But that naked witch says your throat
will be cut by your own sword. Did I
mention she was naked?

JACK DRAWS HIS SWORD -- CASUALLY TOSSES IT INTO THE OCEAN.

JACK SPARROW
Problem solved.
24.

INT. - KING GEORGE PUB. - PORT ROYAL. - LATER THAT NIGHT

BRITISH SOLDIERS ARE SEARCHING FOR SOMEONE INSIDE THE PUB --
ROUSING DRUNKS AND DERELICTS. JACK AND SCRUM WALK INTO THE
KING GEORGE --

JACK SPARROW
You see, Scrum. My only destiny is a
bottle of rum and a warm bed upstairs.
That witch was a charlatan, a two bit
four-flusher...

SCRUM
Jack -- is that your sword?

A FISHERMAN HAS CUT OPEN HIS NET AND DROPPED HIS CATCH ON THE
BAR -- FISH FLOPPING EVERYWHERE. IN THE PILE OF FISH WE SEE
THAT JACK’S SWORD HAS DROPPED ONTO THE BAR.

JACK SPARROW
No. Must be a fish. A swordfish.

THE LARGEST OF THE FISH FLIPS ITS TAIL AND KNOCKS THE SWORD
ONTO THE FLOOR -- WHERE IT’S QUICKLY KICKED ACROSS THE DIRT
BY A DRUNK -- THEN KICKED BY A COUPLE DANCING -- THE SWORD
EVENTUALLY LANDING RIGHT AT JACK’'S FEET.

JACK SLOWLY BENDS DOWN TO PICK IT UP -- SCRUM HORRIFIED --—

SCRUM
That appears to be a double-edged bone
and steel cutlass with a slight nick
at the tip.

JACK SPARROW
No. There is no destiny!

JACK QUICKLY OPENS A BARREL OF RUM -- DROPS THE SWORD INSIDE
AND THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
We'll try a different pub!

AS HE TURNS TO LEAVE JACK WALKS STRAIGHT INTO A GUN -- THE
WEAPON AIMED AT HIS HEAD.

PIG KELLY
Well, if it isn’t the pirate who stole
my ship!

Jack looks at PIERRE “PIG” KELLY AND HIS FOUR LARGE MEN --
ALL HOLDING WEAPONS.

JACK SPARROW
Pig -- I’ve been looking for you.
Wanted to give you this gold coin as
compensation for borrowing the Gull.
25.

JACK HOLDS UP THE GOLD COIN -- WHICH PIG TAKES.

PIG KELLY
You've been sailing on my ship.

JACK SPARROW
You have three. And this one’s not
much of a ship. One gun, leaks in the
hull, rats everywhere.

SCRUM
Which are delicious by the way.

PIG KELLY
You’1ll settle your debt here and now.

JACK SPARROW
Of course, Pig. Name your price.

PIG KELLY
Her name is Beatrice. And she’s my
daughter.

BEATRICE WALKS UP TO THEM NOW -- STARES AT JACK.
PIG KELLY (CONT’D)
She's a midwife -- no respectable man
will have her. You'll do just fine.
KELLY AND HIS MEN START TO LAUGH.

JACK SPARROW
I‘1l do what?

PIG KELLY
Marry her. Take her off my hands
forever. To clear your debt.

BEATRICE SPITS ON THE FLOOR -- SMILES AT JACK WITH YELLOW
TEETH.
BEATRICE
The honeymoon suite is waiting
upstairs.

JACK SPARROW
Remind me of the other option?

PIG KELLY
A bullet in your eye.

JACK SPARROW
Scrum, go find me an eye patch.

PIG KELLY
Last chance.
26.

GUNS COCKED -- JACK ABOUT TO BE SHOT --

JACK SPARROW
As a Captain I will officiate the
ceremony. How’s next Tuesday?

PIG KELLY
Say “I do” or die.

JACK SPARROW
I’m trying. Having a bit of a midwife
crisis.

SUDDENLY TWO HORRIBLE CHILDREN COME RUSHING UP TO JACK --

KIDS
PAPPA! PAPPA!

SCRUM
Jack, you remember the witch said
you'd be married with kids?!

JACK SPARROW
I do.

PIG KELLY
Congratulations!

AND NOW TEN BRITISH SOLDIERS COME BURSTING INTO THE PUB --
SURROUND JACK AND PLACE HIM UNDER ARREST.

BRITISH SOLDIER
Jack Sparrow, in the name of the King
you are under arrest. You killed 46
men in cold blood aboard the H.M.S.
Monarch.

JACK STARES AT THE WIFE -- THE KIDS -- THE SOLDIERS.
EVERYTHING THE WITCH SAID HAS COME TRUE.

SCRUM
Jack -- can you find out if she has a
sister?

INT. - HOSPITAL ROOM. - INSANE ASYLUM. - ISLAND PORT. - DAY

A HOSPITAL/INSANE ASYLUM IS FULL OF SOLDIERS BACK FROM THE
WAR -- MANY INJURED OR UNFIT TO SERVE.

AN INJURED HENRY MADDOX LIES IN A HOSPITAL BED STARING OUT
THE WINDOW. HE’S LOOKING OUT TO SEA -- HIS EYES BLANK -- THE
HORROR OF HIS ORDEAL STILL ETCHED ACROSS HIS FACE.

A DOCTOR IS TAKING HIS PULSE -- HOLDING A FINGER AT HIS NECK.
SUDDENLY THE FINGER IS REPLACED BY A SWORD --
27.

HENRY SLOWLY TURNS -- STARES UP AT HECTOR BARBOSSA AND HIS
CREW. THEY ARE IN FULL PIRATE ACCOUTERMENT -- AND NURSES AND
DOCTORS ARE BACKING AWAY IN FEAR.

BARBOSSA
It be said one lucky man survived the
massacre of the Monarch. A Captain's
servant now without his senses found
alive at sea -- who tells of murderous
ghosts filling the oceans with blood.

BARBOSSA LEANS IN NOW -- KEEPS HIS SWORD AT HENRY’S THROAT.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
I’ve come to hear the tale.

HENRY MADDOX
Nobody believes in ghost stories.

BARBOSSA
Try me.

HENRY MADDOX
There was a diamond on a French ship --
a yellow diamond found by witches --

BARBOSSA
A diamond in the shape of an eye?
Some say it be the key to unlocking
the Trident. As the legend goes.

HENRY MADDOX
They took it aboard the Monarch -- and
we were attacked by men -- dead men
led by a Captain Brand.

THE NAME CLEARLY REGISTERS WITH BARBOSSA.

HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
Will you take me back there, Sir?

BARBOSSA
You wish to return?

HENRY MADDOX
I left someone alive. Her name is

Olivia -- and I made a promise to find
her -- to save her. And that is what
I will do.

BARBOSSA
Sorry, boy. I don’t sail with
Redcoats.

BARBOSSA TURNS TO LEAVE -—
28.

HENRY MADDOX
The Eye will be his forever. There is
no one to challenge a murderous ghost
with a taste for blood.

BARBOSSA
Blood is common currency. Maybe he
desires something far more valuable.

HENRY MADDOX
What would that be?

BARBOSSA
The one thing all dead men seek.
Revenge.

INT. - BRITISH PRISON. - PORT ROYAL. - DAY

JACK IS BEING HELD DOWN BY TWO BRITISH SOLDIERS AS HE GETS
BEATEN BY ADMIRAL SCARFIELD --

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
We believe the massacre of the Monarch
was the work of pirates. You don’t
kill my men without paying a heavy
debt.

JACK SPARROW
How about I marry your daughter?

AND NOW SCARFIELD HITS HIM HARD ACROSS THE JAW --

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
A pirate is responsible for butchering
those men. Which means a pirate shall
die for it.

JACK SPARROW
Have you considered the work of
William Kidd? I hear his ship has
over 100 guns -- seems to be having a
very good year.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
William Kidd does not sail in these
waters. But you do --

JACK SPARROW
What about Red Beard? He’s very tough
-- and that beard -- it’s very red.
You'd get a nice crowd to see him die.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
You pirates think you can challenge
us? We’re the British Navy -- and we
control the seas.
29.

JACK LOOKS UP AT HIM NOW --

JACK SPARROW
No one can control her. The ocean is
as free as a pirate -- always will be.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
But you’re not free. You’re guilty of
murder and will face a public
execution. How would you like to die?
Hanging, firing squad, or a new
invention -- the guillotine.

JACK SPARROW
Guillotine. Sounds French. I love
the French. How bad can it be?

INT. - PRISON CELLS. - DAY

THE BRITISH COMMAND IN PORT ROYAL HAS FILLED THEIR JAIL WITH
WITCHES -- WOMEN OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES CRAMMED INTO CELLS
AND WAITING TO BE EXECUTED.

JACK IS TAKEN DOWN TO THE JAIL BY TWO GUARDS. AS HE PASSES
BY ONE OF THE CELLS HE CASUALLY SAYS HELLO TO HIS FATHER -——
WHO IS ALSO WAITING TO BE EXECUTED.

JACK SPARROW
How are ya, Dad?

TEAGUE
Never better, Jackie. What are you in
for?

JACK SPARROW
Destiny. You?

TEAGUE
Lechery. By the way, if you're
getting disemboweled ask for Victor.

JACK SPARROW
Excellent tip. What do you know of
the Eye of Poseidon?

TEAGUE
Witches found it. That’s why they’ve
arrested them all -- they want the

diamond back.

JACK SPARROW
If they’re searching for The Eye --
they're going after the Trident as
well.

THE BRITISH GRAB JACK -- TRY TO PULL HIM AWAY.
30.

TEAGUE
Every nation at war is searching for
the Trident, Jackie. But it can never
be found -- as it rests in Poseidon’s
watery grave.

JACK SPARROW
The Tomb of Posedion?

TEAGUE
A tomb never to be disturbed, Jackie.
For no man should hold the sea in his
hands.

THE BRITISH PULL JACK DOWN THE HALL, AND JACK YELLS BACK TO
HIS FATHER.

JACK SPARROW
Dad -- how did you choose to die?

TEAGUE
Guillotine. Sounds French. And I
love the French.

JACK IS THROWN INTO CELL NEAR THE FRONT OF THE PRISON -- A
BUNCH OF CUTTHROATS STARING AT HIM.

INT. — JACK'S SHIP (THE DYING GULL). - DAY

SCRUM IS FACING GIBBS AND THE REST OF JACK’S CREW -- WHO ALL
SEEM CONFUSED AS THEY STAND ON THE MAIN DECK.

PIRATE #1
Doesn’t make no sense, Scrum. Why
would Jack get married and not invite
any of us?

PIRATE #2
Maybe he’s ashamed of us.
SCRUM
You're not following --
PIRATE #1
And why would he kill 46 men in cold
blood?
PIRATE #2
On his wedding day no less.
SCRUM
The point is -- Jack’s been arrested.
PIRATE #1

Since we did not attend the wedding --
are we obliged to make an offering of
gifts?
31.

GIBBS
He’s about to be killed straight away!
We have to do something.

PIRATE #3
And why would we do that? Seems to me
he’s lied to us, fleeced and swindled
us at every turn.

PIRATE #2
And when we was going straight.

GIBBS
Are you forgetting the diamonds!
Knowing Jack he’s probably got his
hands on that treasure right now!

PIRATE #2
There is no treasure. Just another
lie from Captain Sparrow.

GIBBS
Aye. But a lie from Jack Sparrow
always leads to another lie -- a
bigger lie -- a lie that on occasion

leads to a grain of truth.
THE MEN LOOK AT GIBBS NOW --

GIBBS (CONT'D)
So if you be wanting your share of
this lie -- you’ll have to save him!

INT. - JAIL CELL. - DAY

FROM INSIDE HIS CELL, JACK LOOKS AT THE WITCHES DIRECTLY
ACROSS FROM HIM. THEY ARE CRAMMED INTO THEIR CELL -- A
CHARMLESS AND UNRULY BUNCH OF HAGS -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
ONE NEAR THE BACK WALL.

CARINA SMYTH IS FURIOUSLY WRITING ON THE WALLS -- THE CELL
COVERED WITH STRANGE EQUATIONS -- IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND.
JACK LOOKS AT HER -- AT THE NUMBERS -- AS THE OTHER WITCHES
SURROUND HER.

WITCH
So what's these markings on the wall
then?

WITCH #2

Casting spells no doubt. She’s going
to free us all from the hangman's
noose!

CARINA SMYTH
I’m no witch.
32.

THEY ALL LAUGH AT HER -——

WITCH
Tell us then -- what is it you’re
scribbling there? What are all those

numbers?

CARINA SMYTH
It’s an equation from Galileo’s diary.
I believe it’s part of a map.

JACK SPARROW
What kind of map?

CARINA TURNS TO HIM -- LOOKS ACROSS AT HIM WITH PIERCING BLUE
EYES.

CARINA SMYTH
You wouldn’t understand. It’s a Map --

JACK SPARROW
-- No Man Can Read.

AND NOW CARINA WALKS TO THE BARS --— AND JACK GETS TO HIS FEET
-- KNOWS HIS DESTINY IS STANDING DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM HIM --
THAT SHE ALONE CAN LEAD HIM WHERE HE NEEDS TO GO. MTHERE’S
JUST ONE SMALL PROBLEM.

BRITISH SOLDIER
Open the cells. It’s time to die.

EXT. - PUBLIC EXECUTION SQUARE. - PORT ROYAL. - DAY

THE TOWN SQUARE IS FILLED WITH PRISONERS WAITING TO BE
KILLED. A CROWD OF LOCALS IS CHEERING, SCREAMING, ENJOYING
THE SPECTACLE OF PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.

CLOSE ON A TERRIFIED PIRATE LOCKED INSIDE THE GUILLOTINE,
PRAYING TO HIMSELF. THE EXECUTIONER PULLS THE SWITCH, AND
THE BLADE COMES DOWN HARD -- THE MAN’S HEAD ROLLING INTO A
BASKET. JACK STANDS NEXT TO THE GUILLOTINE WATCHING THIS
WITH A LOOK OF SHEER REPULSION ON HIS FACE.

JACK SPARROW
So that’s a guillotine?

THEY DRAG JACK UP TO THE GUILLOTINE -- OPEN THE LOCKS --—

JACK SPARROW (CONT'D)
I've changed my mind. Like to go with
firing squad. Is there someone I
could talk to...

BRITISH SOLDIER
Silence!
33.

JACK SPARROW
The French are obviously sick people.
How about a good old-fashioned stoning
-- gets the crowd involved.

THEY SHOVE JACK INTO THE GUILLOTINE AND TRY TO LOCK HIM IN.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
There’s quite a bit of blood on there.
And a good portion of neck.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE CARINA SMYTH IS STANDING ON
THE GALLOWS PLATFORM -- A NOOSE AROUND HER NECK.

SHE TAKES

CARINA SMYTH
These will be the last words of Carina
Smyth.

OUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND BEGINS TO READ.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
Good Sirs -- I am not a witch and have
never practiced witchcraft. But I
forgive your common dim-wittedness and
feeble brains incapable of educated
thought. In short, most of you have
the mind of a goat --

Jack yells out from the guillotine.

JACK SPARROW
If I could request a word. Is it not
common practice for those being
executed to be offered a last meal?

CARINA SMYTH
Sir, I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.

JACK SPARROW
My head is about to be lopped off --
hence the urgency.

CARINA SMYTH
And my neck is to be broken.

JACK SPARROW
On occasion the neck doesn’t break.

CARINA SMYTH

What?

JACK SPARROW
I’ve seen men swing for hours -- the
life slowly choking out of them. Eyes
bulging, tongue swelling -- not

pretty.
34.

CARINA SMYTH
May I finish!

JACK SPARROW
The point is -- it’s entirely possible
you still have hours left to whisper
your last words, whereas my head will
soon be in this basket staring up at
my lifeless body -- which happens to
be famished!

CARINA SMYTH
Go ahead and kill him. I’11 wait.

JACK SPARROW
I wouldn’t hear of it. Witches first.

CARINA SMYTH
I AM NOT A WITCH! WERE YOU NOT
LISTENING?

JACK SPARROW
HARD TO LISTEN WITH THE MIND OF A
GOAT!

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
ENOUGH! KILL THEM BOTH!!

CARINA’S HANDS ARE TIED BEHIND HER BACK -- AND JACK WATCHES
AS THE EXECUTIONER STEPS FORWARD.

BRITISH SOLDIER
WE NOW PUT TO DEATH THE PIRATE JACK
SPARROW -—

JACK SPARROW
MIGHT STARVE TO DEATH FIRST --

BRITISH SOLDIER
-- AND THE WITCH CARINA SMYTH.

CARINA SMYTH
NOT A WITCH. NEVER BEEN A WITCH.

BRITISH SOLDIER
ON THIS DAY BEFORE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF
PORT ROYAL -- MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON
THEIR SOULS --

AT THE GUILLOTINE THE EXECUTIONER HITS THE SWITCH -- JACK
CLOSING HIS EYES --

BUT AS THE BLADE DROPS AN EXPLOSION ROCKS THE TOWN -—

THE TOP HALF OF THE GUILLOTINE HAS BEEN BLOWN OFF -- THE
BLADE FLYING INTO TWO SOLDIERS AND CUTTING THEM DOWN --
35.
A CANNON HAS BEEN DRAGGED TO THE MIDDLE OF TOWN BY JACK’S
CREW --
EXHAUSTED PIRATES STANDING BEHIND IT --

SCRUM AND GIBBS QUICKLY RELOADING AS THE REST OF JACK’S CREW
DRAWS THEIR SWORDS --

THE BRITISH HAVE BEEN CAUGHT OFF GUARD -- SCRAMBLE FOR
POSITION --

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
PIRATES! !

THE CROWD TAKING COVER AS THE PIRATES ATTACK --

SCRUM
FIRE!!

THE CANNON FIRING AGAIN -- TAKING OUT THE SOLDIERS FROM THE
FIRING SQUAD --

JACK GETS TO HIS FEET -- STARTS TO FIGHT THE SOLDIERS AROUND
HIM -- WHICH IS HARD TO DO WITH HIS HEAD AND HANDS STILL IN
THE LOCKS OF THE GUILLOTINE --

CARINA WATCHING THE CHAOS FROM THE GALLOWS -- TRYING TO FREE
HERSELF --

A PIRATE FIGHTING A BRITISH SOLDIER RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER --
THE TWO MEN MOVING AROUND THE DROP SWITCH -- EXCHANGING BLOWS
-- AS A THIRD CANNON BALL HITS THE WALL OF A BUILDING --
SOLDIERS CRUSHED BY FALLING STONES --—

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
PULL BACK!

THE HANDFUL OF BRITISH START TO RETREAT -- TAKE COVER --—
AS THE BRITISH SOLDIER IS KNOCKED COLD RIGHT IN FRONT OF
CARINA -- FALLS NEXT TO THE DROP SWITCH -- MISSING IT BY
INCHES --—

UNTIL HIS HAND LANDS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT --

AND THE FLOOR OPENS UNDER HER -- CARINA DROPPING STRAIGHT
DOWN AS SHE BEGINS TO HANG -- CHOKING IN THE SQUARE --

JACK RUSHING TOWARD SCRUM AND GIBBS --

JACK SPARROW
THE GIRL! FIRE THE CANNON!!

GIBBS
THERE’S NO MORE CANNONBALLS!
36.

AND JACK GRABS THE LAST PRISONER'S HEAD FROM THE BASKET --
SHOVES IT INSIDE THE CANNON -- KICKS THE CANNON TOWARD CARINA
AND THE GALLOWS --

JACK SPARROW

FIRE!!!
THE CANNON FIRES -- THE HEAD SAILING ACROSS THE TOWN SQUARE
AND CUTTING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TOP OF THE GALLOWS -- THE

ROPE SNAPPING AND CARINA DROPPING HARD TO THE GROUND -—
SLAMMING HER HEAD AS SHE’S KNOCKED COLD.

THE SMOKE CLEARS -- AND NOW WE SEE A FULL REGIMENT OF BRITISH
SOLDIERS COMING DOWN FROM THE MAIN FORT -- WHICH IS PERCHED
HIGH ON A HILL ABOVE THE TO! --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Collect the girl, Mr. Gibbs. It’s
time to leave Port Royal.

EXT. - HARBOR. - DAY

JACK, SCRUM AND GIBBS RUSH WITH THE REST OF THE CREW TO BOARD
THE DYING GULL -- THE UNCONSCIOUS CARINA CARRIED ONTO THE
SHIP -—-

GIBBS
Shove off, boys!

JACK SPARROW
Un-lash the boot and bring the draw --

JACK AT THE WHEEL -- A VOICE CAUSING HIM TO FREEZE --
PIG KELLY
You think I’m letting you take my
ship? Again?

JACK TURNS TO SEE PIG KELLY STANDING BEHIND HIM ON DECK --—
GUN DRAWN AND AIMED AT JACK’'S FOREHEAD.

JACK SPARROW
Well, Pig, it would appear you have no
choice.

PIG KELLY
How do you figure?

A GUN IS NOW PLACED AT KELLY’S HEAD. THE WEAPON COCKED --

BEATRICE
Step away from me husband.

BEATRICE HAS HER OWN GUN OUT -- AIMS IT AT HER FATHER. SHE
SPITS -- AND HER FATHER CAN HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT’S HAPPENING.
37.

PIG KELLY
This loathsome pirate is trying to
steal my ship.

BEATRICE
He’s already stolen me heart.

JACK TAKES THE GUN FROM KELLY’S HAND AS SEVERAL PIRATES GRAB
HIM FROM BEHIND.

JACK SPARROW
Thank you, darling. But I really must
go now. My best to the children.

JACK AT THE WHEEL -—

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Draw the main! We’re shoving off to
race the gallows!

AS THE DYING GULL HEADS OUT TO SEA -- BEATRICE AND PIG KELLY
STAND ON THE DOCK WATCHING THEM GO --—

BEATRICE
I'LL BE WAITING!

PIG KELLY’S OWN MEN APPROACH WITH GUNS DRAWN -- OPEN FIRE ON
THE GULL --

AS PIG MOTIONS TO ANOTHER SHIP IN THE HARBOR --—

PIG KELLY
Ready the Essex! We’ll chase her down
before the sun sets.

EXT. - JACK’S SHIP. - DAY

JACK SMILES AS HE LOOKS OUT AT THE HORIZON -- HAPPY TO BE AT
SEA AGAIN. SCRUM NEXT TO HIM -—

SCRUM
The crew won’t stand for a woman,
Jack.

SCRUM MOTIONS TO CARINA -- STILL UNCONSCIOUS ON THE DECK --

JACK SPARROW
She will lead me to the Trident.

SCRUM
But a woman on board brings nothing
but bad luck. And rabies.

JACK SPARROW
Frivolous superstition, Mr. Scrum. As
you can see, luck is steadfast on my
side.
38.

ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS APPROACHES JACK WITH A SWORD.

PIRATE #1
Good news, Captain. I found this in
town this morning. It was inside an
empty barrel of rum --

THE CREW MEMBER HOLDS UP THE SWORD -- HANDS IT TO JACK.
PIRATE #1 (CONT’D)
I believe it’s yours. A double-edged
bone and steel cutlass --

JACK SPARROW
YES! I can see it’s mine!

JACK LOOKS TERRIFIED AS HE SLOWLY REACHES OUT TO GRAB HIS OWN
SWORD -- GLANCES AT A TERRIFIED SCRUM --

SCRUM
It’s been a pleasure knowing you.

AND JACK TOSSES THE SWORD INTO THE SEA --
INT. - BARBOSSA’S SHIP. - DAY
Barbossa is at the wheel of THE QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE --

eyeing the sea as he holds BLACKBEARD’S SWORD. PINTEL AND
RAGETTI APPROACH HIM -- BOTH A BIT HESITANT.

PINTEL
Sir, not that it’s our place to ask
questions --

RAGETTI

Or to question the answer that you may
give to such a question --

PINTEL
Which by right -- you need not answer -—

RAGETTI
But the men be asking to which port we
sail? Seeing as that British soldier
mentioned the name of a Captain Brand.

PINTEL
A Captain as dead as any man who
dwells at the bottom of the sea.

RAGETTI
And his crew -- very dead men one and
all. As the tale is told.
39.

BARBOSSA
Tell the men we're searching for the
Trident of Poseidon. A treasure so
powerful it puts all others to shame.

RAGETTI
But our ship is full of treasure, Sir.

BARBOSSA
Imagine all the warring nations having
to bid for their own survival. A
King’s ransom the likes of which no
pirate has ever seen! This be the
power of the Trident -- the last
treasure any man need hold.

Pintel and Ragetti look confused now.

PINTEL
Last treasure?

BARBOSSA
Now be the time to find a tranquil
island -- a place to put my leg up.
The Trident will be the last treasure
these hands possess.

PINTEL
And this Captain Brand? What should
we tell the crew?

BARBOSSA
Tell them we’re about to tap on his
door -- see if he’s home.

AND NOW WE SEE THE OUTLINE OF THE TRIANGLE IN THE DISTANCE --
THE THREE BORDER ISLANDS FORMING A VISION OF NAUTICAL HORROR —
- DARK CLOUDS AND FOG RESTING ABOVE THE WATER --

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Gentlemen -- welcome to The Devil's
Triangle!

TWO LARGE ROCK FORMATIONS SERVE AS THE ENTRANCE -- AND
BARBOSSA IS SAILING STRAIGHT FOR THEM -- USING BLACKBEARD’S
SWORD TO MAKE WAY.

AND NOW BARBOSSA CALMLY SAILS HIS SHIP STRAIGHT TOWARD THE
DEVIL’S TRIANGLE -- USES HIS SWORD TO CONTROL THE WIND IN HIS
SAILS --

THE CREW STARING OUT AT THE TRIANGLE IN THE DISTANCE -- ALL
OF THEM IMMEDIATELY AWARE OF THEIR FATE.

EXT. -— JACK’S SHIP. - DAY

JACK TAKES A BUCKET OF WATER -- THROWS IT ON CARINA --
40.

Carina coughing up water -- soaking wet and furious as she
gets to her feet -- looks around at Jack -- the ship -- the
crew. ALL THE MEN STARING AT HER NOW. SHE BACKS AWAY FROM
THEM ALL -- CLEARLY SCARED --

CARINA SMYTH
How did I get here? Where are you
taking me?

JACK SPARROW
Is that the thanks I get for saving
your neck?

CARINA SMYTH
You're that pirate -- Jack Sparrow.

JACK SPARROW
Captain Jack Sparrow.

CARINA SMYTH
What do you want with me? Where is my
diary?

JACK HOLDS UP HER DIARY.

JACK SPARROW
It’s just a bunch of numbers. I'’11 be
needing that map. The Map No Man Can
Read.

CARINA SMYTH
If you could read it -- then it
wouldn’t be called The Map No Man Can
Read.

GIBBS
She's got a point there, Jack.

JACK SPARROW
Most of the men on this ship can’t
read -- so that makes all maps The Map
No Man Can Read.

CARINA SMYTH
If no one can read it -- then you have
no use for it or me.

GIBBS
Hard to argue there, Jack.

JACK SPARROW
I need to free a ship from a bottle.
And you have a map --

CARINA SMYTH
Nobody has this map -- as it does not
exist --
41.

JACK SPARROW
Then why does it have a name?

CARINA SMYTH
The name clearly defines it as an
imperceptible object.

SCRUM
I was about to say that.

CARINA SMYTH
Then we all agree there is no map?

GIBBS
Settled!

JACK SPARROW
You're confusing these poor men!
Which is what witches do best!

AND NOW THERE IS DEAD SILENCE -- THE CREW LOOKING TO JACK AND
STEPPING BACK IN FEAR --

PIRATE #1
Did he say “witches”?

PIRATE #2
Jack, tell us you didn’t bring a witch
on a ship?

JACK SPARROW
Of course not. Look at her luminous
yellow hair. Those round and
bountiful -- eyes. Does she resemble
any witch you've seen?

CARINA SMYTH
I am not a witch.

JACK SPARROW
You see. Not a witch.

CARINA SMYTH
I’m an astronomer.

PIRATE #2
Oh, so you make hats?

CARINA SMYTH
An astronomer contemplates the stars.
The planets. This is what I was doing
when they arrested me. I had mapped
the solar system.

A LONG BEAT AS THEY ALL STARE AT HER --—
42.

CREW MEMBER #3
SHE'S A WITCH!

Jack steps in front of her now -- draws his sword and puts it
at her throat.

JACK SPARROW
Allow me to simplify this equation.
Give me that map or I'll let them kill
you.

CARINA SMYTH
If they kill me you’1ll never get the

map.

GIBBS
Excellent bit of reasoning there,
Jack.

JACK SPARROW
YOU ARE EXCUSED, MR. GIBBS!!!

CARINA SMYTH
You can kidnap me, imprison me, kill
me if you wish. But I’1ll never give
you what you want!

And now Jack puts the sword away.

JACK SPARROW
What I want is a cup of tea. Care to

join me?
INT. - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS. - DAY
Carina is staring at her own hand -- can barely keep her eyes

open. SHE IS CLEARLY DRUNK -- trying desperately to focus.

CARINA SMYTH
What kind of tea did you say it was?

JACK SPARROW
Pirate’s tea. Family recipe.

JACK STANDS BEHIND HER SPIKING HER TEA WITH RUM.
CARINA SMYTH
It has a funny taste. I can’t quite
figure it out --
JACK SPARROW
Unlike The Map No Man Can Read? Which
you have solved.

SHE SMILES NOW -- DRINKS SOME MORE --—
43.

CARINA SMYTH
Can you keep a secret, Captain Jack?

JACK SPARROW
Why steal secrets if you’re not going
to keep them?

CARINA SMYTH
There’s a reason the Map has never
been read by any man. Or woman.

She leans in close now -- whispers to him.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
The Map is written in the stars.

JACK SPARROW
Someone must have an enormous quill.

SHE TAKES OUT A SMALL BLACK BOOK --

CARINA SMYTH
Galileo's diary dates back to the
first astronomer -- Plato himself.
The diary is full of celestial
binomials -- equations passed down
through the centuries from scholar to
scholar -- the last being my father.
None of them could figure it out.

JACK SPARROW
But you have?

CARINA SMYTH
Once every 243 years the planet Venus
crosses directly in front of Orion’s
Belt -- known as the Three Fingers of
God. This event is known as The
Transit of Venus.

JACK SPARROW
I'll drink to that.

CARINA SMYTH
This is the answer to the equation.
With a clear sky the stars themselves
will map the Devil’s Triangle.

JACK SPARROW
A map that will lead you to the Tomb
of Poseidon. And the Trident inside.

CARINA SMYTH
How could you know about the Trident?

JACK SPARROW
You're not the only witch in town.
44,

CARINA SMYTH
After tonight -- I’1l never be called
a witch again!

JACK SPARROW

Tonight?
CARINA SMYTH
As the sun sets -- my destiny begins!
AND NOW CARINA PASSES OUT -- SHE’S FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE.

JACK SPARROW
I hate destiny.

EXT. -— DEVIL’S TRIANGLE. - DAY

BARBOSSA HAS BLACKBEARD’S SWORD IN HAND -- HAS DELIBERATELY
SAILED HIS SHIP INTO THE HEAVY FOG. AND NOW THE WAITING
BEGINS -- THE CREW ANXIOUSLY LOOKING AROUND IN A PANIC.

THE FOG AND CLOUDS CAST A DARK SHADOW ACROSS THE SHIP --—

A FEW CREW MEMBERS SNEAK DOWN BELOW TO HIDE --—

MOST DRAW THEIR WEAPONS -- REACT TO EVERY NOISE -- OR GUST OF
WIND -- WAITING --

AS BARBOSSA STANDS BACK NEAR THE WHEEL -——

PINTEL AND RAGETTI ACCIDENTLY BUMP INTO EACH OTHER -- ALMOST
SHOOT/SHIT THEMSELVES --

THE SHIP HAS BECOME A HAUNTED HOUSE -- THE MEN CONSCIOUS OF
EVERY CREAK UNDER THEIR FEET -- BUT THERE’S NO SIGN OF
ANYTHING. UNTIL -—-

PINTEL
Captain, is that a ship?

BARBOSSA
Shipwreck.

BARBOSSA STARES INTO THE FOG -- EVEN HE LOOKS SCARED NOW AS
THE SILENT MARY APPEARS CLOSE TO THEM --

BARBOSSA’S CREW AT THE FRONT OF THE SHIP ARE QUICKLY KILLED -—-

CAPTAIN BRAND AND HIS VERY DEAD MEN HAVE COME ABOARD. SOME

OF BARBOSSA’S MEN RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES -- DIVING OFF THE
SHIP -—-
THE GHOSTS MOVING THROUGH THE SHIP -- READY TO KILL ANYONE

AND EVERYTHING -——

CAPTAIN BRAND
Pirates. Kill them all.
45.

CAPTAIN BRAND STEPS TOWARD BARBOSSA NOW -- AND WE SEE HIM
(AND HIS MEN) CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE DEAD MEN
HORRIFYING TO LOOK AT -- A MILITARY UNIT STILL IN UNIFORM -—
ALL LOOKING AS IF THEY'VE WALKED OUT OF HELL ITSELF.

CAPTAIN BRAND MOVES TOWARD BARBOSSA -- AND NOW WE SEE HIS
THROAT IS CUT -- OOZES WITH BLOOD AND MAGGOTS.

BRAND STOPS JUST BEFORE HE REACHES BARBOSSA -- LOOKS TO HIS
LEFT AND SEES THE ROCK FORMATIONS -- WHICH SERVE AS THE
BORDER FOR THE TRIANGLE.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
You've kept half of your ship outside
the triangle. Very clever.

MEN ARE SCREAMING IN THE B.G. --

CAPTRAIN BRAND
Although it doesn’t help the men on
this side of the line.

BARBOSSA
I always bring extra crew just in
case. Welcome aboard The Revenge,
Captain Brand.

CAPTRAIN BRAND
You know my name.

BARBOSSA
Aye. And I’ve come for a confluence.

BRAND AND HIS MEN LAUGH AT THIS.

CAPTRAIN BRAND
Did you hear that, men? This pirate
has come searching for us. All you
have is your life to bargain with.

BARBOSSA
I come with a tale.

CAPTRAIN BRAND
And what would this tale be about?

BARBOSSA
There was a British Captain. A
Captain who had in his command his own
brother -- a brother by the name Eric.
The two men never far apart.

FLASHBACK --
WE SEE YOUNG CAPTAIN JOHN BRAND AND HIS BROTHER ERIC FIGHTING

SIDE BY SIDE ON A BRITISH WAR SHIP -- THE TWO MEN SHOOTING AT
A SPANISH GALLEON --—
46.

SUDDENLY THEIR SHIP GETS ROCKED BY CANNON FIRE -- THE
EXPLOSION BLOWING ERIC OVERBOARD --—

BARBOSSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
While engaged in battle with the
Spanish, Eric was lost to the sea --
sinking beneath the waves.

WE SEE CAPTAIN BRAND REACHING FOR HIS BROTHER -- HOLDING HIM
OVER THE SIDE -- BUT UNABLE TO BRING HIM UP. THROUGH THE
SMOKE CAPTAIN BRAND SEES ERIC DROWNING IN THE DEEP WATER --

BARBOSSA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And so this Captain’s heart was broken
-- knowing he would never see his
brother again.

EXT. —- OPEN OCEAN. - DAY (FLASHBACK)

A PIRATE SHIP sails into frame -- THE PIRATES FISHING A MAN
OUT OF THE WATER --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)
But as fate would have it a pirate
ship found the half-dead soldier --
dragged Eric from certain death and
put him in chains.

WE SEE ERIC ON THE PIRATE SHIP IN CHAINS -——

BARBOSSA (V.O.)
At first they thought to hold him for
ransom, but then the Captain of this
pirate ship saw something in him.

WE SEE ERIC TRYING TO STEAL AN APPLE FROM THE SHIP -- IS
ABOUT TO EAT IT WHEN HE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY SURPRISE --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)
And this Captain decided to train him
in the ways of the pirate. Taught him
everything he knew -- how to steal and
plunder -- how to enjoin a group of
knaves who refuse all orders.

ERIC NO LONGER LOOKS LIKE A SOLDIER. HE RESEMBLES A PIRATE
IN DRESS AND APPEARANCE -- IS HANDED HIS OWN JOLLY ROGER
FLAG.

BARBOSSA (V.O.)
He was taught every vile trick this
Captain knew, until Eric was ready to
take on a ship of his own. Only now
he would be a pirate Captain -- with a
pirate name stealing his own fortune
at sea.
47.

WE SEE ERIC at the wheel of his own Pirate ship -- looking to
the horizon --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)

And so it was. Until one day when the
pirate Eric was attacked in full force
by the British Navy.

EXPLOSIONS ROCKING ERIC’S SHIP -- MEN DEAD ALL AROUND -- NO
CHANCE TO SURVIVE --

ERIC BRAND
Strike the colors! Lower the flag!!

THEY LOWER THE JOLLY ROGER -- BUT THE BRITISH SHIP NEVER
STOPS ATTACKING --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)

He tried to surrender -- but the
Captain of the British ship had a
loathing for all pirates. He kept
firing until he burned the pirate Eric
right out of the water.

AND NOW WE SEE CAPTAIN BRAND ON THE DECK OF HIS OWN BRITISH
SHIP ORDERING THE ASSAULT --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)

You see -- this Captain had no idea he
was killing his own brother.

Murdering the only thing he loved.

CLOSE ON CAPTAIN BRAND WATCHING THE PIRATE SHIP SINK --
SEEING THE FACE OF HIS BROTHER staring across at him --

BARBOSSA (V.O.)

And upon the realization of what he
had done, this Captain soon went into
a rage. And he vowed revenge on one
man. Captain Jack Sparrow. The man
who turned your brother into a pirate.

WE SEE CAPTAIN BRAND RAISE HIS SWORD -- LEAD HIS SHIP TOWARD
THE BLACK PEARL --—

BARBOSSA (V.O.)

And so he chased Jack into the waters
of the Devil’s Triangle -- where Jack
waited for him in a devilish fog --
springing a trap that would send him
to the bottom of the sea.

WE SEE THE BLACK PEARL BLOWING BRAND’S SHIP OUT OF THE WATER -
- THE BRITISH CAPTAIN LOOKING ACROSS AT JACK AS HE SLOWLY
SINKS WITH HIS MEN -- TAKES OUT HIS OWN KNIFE AND CUTS HIS

OWN THROAT AS HE GOES DOWN.
48.

BARBOSSA
And as the Captain sank to the gates
of hell -- a spirit with unfinished

business rose in his place.

BACK IN THE TRIANGLE -- THE GHOST OF CAPTAIN BRAND STARES AT
BARBOSSA -- EYEING HIM WITH FURIOUS DISGUST --

CAPTAIN BRAND
You were on the Pearl?

BARBOSSA
Aye. I saw you die. And soon after I
planned a mutiny against Jack Sparrow
and took the ship as my own.

CAPTAIN BRAND
So my enemy is your enemy?

BARBOSSA
More than you could ever know.

CAPTAIN BRAND
CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW WILL PAY HIS DEBT
TO ME IN BLOOD! NAME YOUR PRICE,

CAPTAIN!
BARBOSSA
The Eye.
BRAND TAKES OUT THE DIAMOND EYE -- HOLDS IT OUT TOWARD

BARBOSSA -- SHOWING IT TO HIM.

CAPTAIN BRAND

Bring him to me -- and I will give you
The Eye. From this moment on -- you
have a deal with the dead.
BARBOSSA
You'll pardon me for not shaking on
it.
INT. - DYING GULL. - SUNSET

CARINA IS PASSED OUT ON DECK -- JACK WALKING HER AROUND AS HE
TRIES TO WAKE HER UP. MOST OF THE CREW NERVOUSLY WATCHING
FROM A DISTANCE. JACK GLANCES AT THE SETTING SUN --

JACK SPARROW
Mr. Scrum -- wake her up.

SCRUM STEPS TOWARD CARINA -- GETS VERY CLOSE TO HER -- TAKES
A DEEP BREATH AND THEN EXHALES INTO HER FACE. HER EYES
IMMEDIATELY POP OPEN AS SHE CHOKES FROM THE VILE STENCH.
49.

CARINA SMYTH
What’s happening?

JACK SPARROW
The sun is down. I believe there’s a
map to be found.

CARINA TAKES THE TELESCOPE FROM JACK’S HAND -- BEGINS TO
MONITOR THE STARS --

CARINA SMYTH
It begins. The Transit of Venus has --

SCRUM
SHIP TO THE AFT!! COMING RIGHT
QUICK!!
JACK GRABS HIS SCOPE BACK -- SEES A SHIP COMING UP BEHIND
THEM --
MR. GIBBS

It’s a surprise attack, Jack.
JACK SPARROW
Pig Kelly has come to collect his
debt. Which is my neck.
SHE TAKES THE SCOPE BACK FROM HIM -- EYEING THE STARS --

CARINA SMYTH
If I could have a bit of quiet --

MR. GIBBS
He’1l be on us in no time.

JACK EYING THE SEA --

JACK SPARROW
Weapons, Mr. Gibbs?

MR. GIBBS
No cannon -- no balls. We have three
muskets, one swivel and four barrels

of powder.

JACK SPARROW
And we're being chased by a fully
loaded shallop with twelve heavy guns.

SCRUM
We can’t fight her -- and we can’t
outrun those guns.

MR. GIBBS
Should we strike the colors?

Jack thinking for a BEAT --
50.

JACK SPARROW
No need to surrender. You said it
yourself, this is a surprise attack.

MR. GIBBS
Yes, but this is their surprise, Jack.

JACK SPARROW
Depends which way you look at it.

EXT. —- ESSEX. - NIGHT

PIG KELLY IS AT THE WHEEL OF THE ESSEX -- HE AND HIS MEN
PREPARING TO CHASE JACK DOWN --

CREW MEMBER
SIR -- THERE’S SMOKE COMING FROM THE
GULL!

THROUGH THE EYEGLASS -- KELLY SEES SMOKE COMING FROM THE BACK
OF JACK’S SHIP --

PIG KELLY
What’s he doing?

EXT. -— JACK'S SHIP. —- CONTINUOUS

BARRELS OF GUNPOWDER HAVE BEEN LIT -- ARE BEING TOSSED OFF
THAT BACK OF THE DYING GULL --

CLOSE ON

FOUR BARRELS OF BURNING POWDER FLOATING IN THE WATER -- ALL
BILLOWING THICK BLACK SMOKE --

EXT. -— KELLY’S SHIP. - CONTINUOUS

THROUGH THE EYEGLASS KELLY SEES A CURTAIN OF SMOKE IN FRONT
OF HIM --

PIG KELLY
He’s lit the powder.

KELLY AT THE WHEEL NOW -- HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THE BLACK
SMOKE --—

PIG KELLY (CONT’D)
You can run but you can’t hide, Jack
Sparrow!

KELLY SAILS STRAIGHT INTO THE CURTAIN OF BLACK SMOKE -—
EVERYONE BLINDED FOR A BEAT AS THEY WAIT TO EMERGE -—

AS THEY COME OUT OF THE BLACKNESS --

THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE JACK’S SHIP WAITING FOR THEM ON THE
OTHER SIDE --
PIG KELLY (CONT’D)
He lowered his sails and dropped
anchor!!

CREW MEMBER
SURPRISE ATTACK!! WE’RE TAKING A
DIRECT HIT!

KELLY TRIES TO TURN HIS WHEEL -- SEES JACK AT THE
THE GULL --

THE TWO SHIPS SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER -- THE MEN
BACK FROM THE FORCE OF THE CRASH --

51.

WHEEL OF

KNOCKED

JACK’S SHIP PIERCING THE HULL OF THE ESSEX -- A HUGE HOLE IN

PIG’S SHIP AS WATER FLOWS IN -—-
HE LOOKS STRAIGHT ACROSS AT JACK -- WHO WAVES --

JACK SPARROW
Surprise.

PIG KELLY
ATTACK!!

GRAPPLING HOOKS ARE THROWN -- THE TWO SHIPS NOW CONNECTED -—

EXT. - DYING GULL. - CONTINUOUS

KELLY AND HIS CREW SWING ACROSS TO JACK’S SHIP --
GUNS OUT AS JACK’S CREW FIGHTS KELLY’S MEN --

KELLY SWINGS ONTO THE DECK RIGHT IN FRONT OF JACK

JACK DRAWING HIS SWORD -- THEN LOOKS AT IT -- HAS
THOUGHTS --

JACK SPARROW
Not exactly sure which side this sword
is on.

AS KELLY CHARGES -- AND JACK RUNS --

CARINA CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE SKY -- LYING FLAT
AS THE BATTLE TAKES PLACE ALL AROUND --

CARINA SMYTH
Venus is crossing through the straits
of fire toward Orion! Right Ascension
at 101.287 degrees, Declination --
16.716 degrees.

SWORDS AND

SECOND

ON HER BACK

SHE STARTS SKETCHING IN HER BLACK BOOK -- THE LINES FROM THE
SKY NOW PART OF THE EQUATION AS A MAP BEGINS TO FORM --

MEN FIGHTING -- PIRATES STABBING KELLY’S MEN -- GUNS FIRING --
52.

CARINA OBLIVIOUS TO IT ALL -- KEEPING HER FOCUS ON VENUS --
CREATING THE MAP --

A MAN DROPS DEAD NEXT TO HER -- AND SHE MOVES OVER A FEW
INCHES -- CONTINUES TO DRAW THE MAP ——

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
This is incredible -- Venus is moving
North.

THE TELESCOPE GETS KNOCKED FROM HER HANDS -- ROLLS ACROSS THE
DECK --

CARINA CRAWLING TOWARD IT -- TRYING TO GET IT BACK AS MEN
FIGHT AND DIE ALL AROUND HER -——

JACK CORNERED BY PIG KELLY NOW -- WHO DRAWS HIS GUN AND IS
ABOUT TO KILL HIM --

CARINA REACHING FOR THE SCOPE -- SEES A GUN LYING ON THE
DECK. SHE PICKS IT UP -- SEES JACK CORNERED BY KELLY --—

CARINA FIRES THE GUN -- ACCIDENTALLY SHOOTS A PIRATE WHO
STABS ONE OF KELLY’S MEN -- WHO FALLS ACROSS A ROPE AND CUTS
IT WITH HIS SWORD --

THE ROPE FREES A GRAPPLING HOOK THAT SWINGS ACROSS INTO KELLY
-- WHO IS KNOCKED OFF THE SIDE OF THE SHIP --

CARINA DROPS THE GUN AND GOES BACK TO THE SKY --

KELLY’S MEN RETREATING NOW -- RUSHING BACK TO THEIR OWN SHIP
AS JACK'S MEN CHASE THEM AWAY --

AS CARINA GRABS THE EYEGLASS -- QUICKLY LIES BACK DOWN AND
LOOKS TO THE SKY -- FINISHES THE MAP --

WE SEE KELLY’S MEN QUICKLY SAILING AWAY -- JACK AND HIS CREW
CHEERING THEIR VICTORY --

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
Venus has disappeared behind Orion and
the Three Fingers of God.

CARINA COMES UP ON DECK -- HOLDS OUT THE MAP TO THE MEN -- A
MAP IN THE SHAPE OF A TRIANGLE. EVERYONE TURNS TO HER NOW --

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
I was right -- the map exists! This
is the Triangle -- and this is an
island inside it --

GIBBS
An island in the Devil’s Triangle?

CARINA SMYTH
An island no man has ever seen.
53.

SCRUM
From a map no man can read?

CARINA SMYTH
This is where we'll find the Tomb of
Poseidon!

JACK SPARROW
Carina -- perhaps we should talk in
private.

CARINA SMYTH
As is my right -- I will name it the
Coffin Island -- after the coffin star
Delphinus. There is a clear passage
from the West, Jack -- it is here that
we will find the Trident! Gentleman --
set sail for the Devil’s Triangle --

EXT. - OPEN OCEAN. - MORNING

JACK IS ROWING A LONGBOAT -- CLEARLY ANNOYED AS HE STARES
ACROSS AT CARINA WHO IS CASUALLY STUDYING HER MAP -——

CARINA SMYTH
So that was a mutiny. I must admit it
was rather exciting. All those swords
and guns. The larger men holding you
down and beating you when you refused
to leave. The smaller men lining up
to slap you --

JACK SPARROW
You just cost me the command of two
ships.

CARINA SMYTH
Two?

JACK SPARROW
One was in a bottle. Long story.

CARINA SMYTH
And you blame me? The woman you
kidnapped?

JACK SPARROW
You were the only witch on the ship.

CARINA SMYTH
I am not a witch!

JACK SPARROW
And I am not a Captain!

CARINA SMYTH
On that we both agree.
54.

JACK SPARROW
In case you have forgotten, the
aforementioned kidnapping also
included the saving of your neck --

CARINA SMYTH
You did not save me out of courtesy.
You seek the Trident --

JACK SPARROW
I have no choice. There’s a ghost who
dwells in the haunted waters of the
Triangle, a spirit plotting his
escape.

CARINA SMYTH
A spirit?

JACK SPARROW
I have to find the Trident before he
does.

CARINA STARING AT HIM -- CAN’T HELP BUT LAUGH --

CARINA SMYTH
Ghosts! That is what all of you
pirates are afraid of? GHOSTS!!

JACK SPARROW
Yes. Ghosts. And lizards. And
Quakers.

CARINA SMYTH
I assure you, there are no ghosts in
the Devil’s Triangle or anywhere else.
Science does not support it.

JACK SPARROW
And if you're wrong?

CARINA SMYTH
Did I not predict the crossing of
Venus?

JACK SPARROW
You think you’re the only one who
knows anything about Venus? Venus was
the Roman goddess of love and beauty.

CARINA SMYTH
And who taught you that?

JACK SPARROW
A girl named Venus --

CARINA SMYTH
Was she academically inclined?
55.

JACK SPARROW
More like vertically reclined.

CARINA SMYTH
My calculations are precise and true.
I’m not just an astronomer -- I’m also
a horologist.

JACK SPARROW
No shame in that, dear. We all have
to earn a living.

CARINA SMYTH
No. A Horologist!

JACK SPARROW
Yes. So was Venus. Although she
didn’t shout it quite as loud as you.
I must say you seem very proud!

CARINA SMYTH
Horology is the study of time.

JACK SPARROW
She was constantly studying her watch.

CARINA SMYTH
Time is everything, Captain Sparrow.

JACK SPARROW
I prefer timing.

CARINA HOLDS UP THE WATCH AROUND HER NECK.

CARINA SMYTH
This Chronometer keeps the exact time
in London. If I make an altitude
measurement to a known heavenly body
such as the sun -- we will find land.

LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CHRONOMETER -- BLINDING JACK.

JACK SPARROW
That thing will draw attention where
it’s not wanted.

CARINA SMYTH
East is that way. Row!

JACK SPARROW
You are sailing with Captain Jack
Sparrow. I will find land with this
compass. A compass which takes me to
the exact place I wish to go.

JACK OPENS HIS COMPASS -- BUT IT POINTS STRAIGHT AT CARINA.
56.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Broken. Let’s try it your way.

INT. —- MELIA’S SHACK. - DAY

THE BRITISH break down the door to MELIA’S SHACK -- weapons
at the ready. ADMIRAL SCARFIELD SLOWLY WALKS IN -- LOOKS
ACROSS AT MELIA -- LONG HAIR COVERING HER BODY --

MELIA
Admiral Scarfield. Do you know the
price you pay for coming in my door?

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
Get her dressed.

BRITISH SOLDIER
Sir, we’ve been warned never to touch
this one.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
She's coming with us.

INT. - BRITISH JAIL. - PORT ROYAL. - DAY

SCARFIELD and his men lead Melia down to the prison. They
push her into the WITCH’S CELL -- WHICH IS FULL OF WOMEN
WAITING TO BE EXECUTED.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD
The wall. Read it.

THE “WITCHES” MOVE ASIDE FOR MELIA -- CLEARLY THEY FEAR HER.
MELIA WALKS TOWARD THE BACK WALL, THE WALL WHERE CARINA HAD
DRAWN THE EQUATIONS FOR THE “MAP NO MAN CAN READ.”

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)
Read it or die.

MELIA SLOWLY REACHES UP AND TOUCHES THE MAP -- AND SUDDENLY
WE SEE A DROP OF BLOOD ON THE WALL. THE DROP TURNS INTO
SEVERAL BLOODY LINES -- LINES WHICH START TO RUN TOGETHER AND
FORM AN IMAGE. AN IMAGE THAT RESEMBLES A TRIDENT. THE
BRITISH SOLDIERS NERVOUS NOW --

SCARFIELD WALKS INTO THE CELL -- STARES UP AT THE BLOODY
IMAGE ON THE WALL.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)
You will lead us to the Trident. Or
I'll kill them all.

HE MOTIONS TO THE OTHER WOMEN -- THE CELLS ARE FILLED WITH
“WITCHES.”

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)
Their destiny is in your hands.
57.

She looks to Scarfield and slowly nods.

ADMIRAL SCARFIELD (CONT’D)
Prepare the ship. And the cage.

EXT. - QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE. - DAY

BARBOSSA IS USING BLACKBEARD’S SWORD TO PUSH HIS SHIP TO THE
LIMIT. AS THE QUEEN ANNE MOVES THROUGH THE WATER THE WOOD
BEGINS TO BUCKLE FROM THE SHEER FORCE -- CREW MEMBERS HANGING
ON FOR DEAR LIFE -- EYEING THE BEAMS WITH CAUTION --

PINTEL
Captain, perhaps you should decrease
the demands we’re putting on the ship!

RAGETTI
It feels as if we’re going to break
the wind.

BARBOSSA

The condemned of Port Royal told us
Jack had escaped to these waters. I
know the lines he favors to sail.
We'll hunt him as the day is long.

BARBOSSA RAISES THE SWORD EVEN HIGHER -- THE SHIP GOING
FASTER --

CREW MEMBER
Captain -- off the bow!!

AND NOW BARBOSSA SEES A SHIP IN THE DISTANCE -—-—

BARBOSSA
RUN HER DOWN!!!

EXT. - JACK’S SHIP. - THE DYING GULL. - LATER

Barbossa and his men have boarded Jack's ship. The crew
standing down as Barbossa steps toward them.

BARBOSSA
Where is he, Gibbs?

GIBBS
It was a mutiny.

BARBOSSA
It always is.

GIBBS
We set Jack adrift. With a witch.

This gets Barbossa’s attention.
58.

SCRUM
A witch who pulled a map from the
stars.

AND NOW BARBOSSA SLOWLY TURNS -- LOOKS OUT TO SEA -—-

BARBOSSA
Mr. Ragetti! Find me the nearest
shore.

RAGETTI BRINGS OVER A MAP -——

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
There is but one island a longboat
could reach from this vile ship!

Jack Sparrow will be in Coronation Bay
-- or he’ll be at the bottom of the
sea.

AND NOW BARBOSSA SEES SOMETHING ELSE -- HE OPENS A SATCHEL
AND PULLS OUT THE BLACK PEARL IN THE BOTTLE -——

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Gentlemen -- I’1l be taking my ship.

INT. - LONGBOAT. - DAY

Carina is sweating, suffering from the heat as she reads her
chronometer -- taking notes as she tries to figure out where
they are and where to go. Jack is exhausted -- still rowing -
- but secretly happy that she is lost.

JACK SPARROW
It would appear your superlative brain
has us led us astray. This could well
be the end.

JACK TAKES OUT A SMALL LEATHER FLASK -- DRINKS FROM IT.

CARINA SMYTH
You have water!

JACK SPARROW
Of course not. I’m trying to survive.

JACK FINISHES THE RUM -- LICKS THE LAST DROP.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Now I’m in trouble.

CARINA SMYTH
You are an abject creature. A
befouled pirate.

JACK SPARROW
High praise coming from a horologist.
59.

CARINA IS READING THE MAP NOW -- LOOKS CONFUSED --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Something wrong with your map?

CARINA SMYTH
I don’t require any help.

JACK SPARROW

Perhaps I should take a look -- seeing
as Maps are part of my chosen
vocation.

HE SLIDES TOWARD HER -- VERY CLOSE -- AND SHE TRIES TO MOVE
AWAY FROM HIM.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Where did you get that earring?

CARINA SMYTH
A gift from my father -- a father I
never knew.

JACK SPARROW
A clover is bad luck at sea. He
wasn’t a sailor.

CARINA SMYTH
He was a scientist. The earring was
left to me after he died -- along with
a love of the stars. The most
beautiful thing there is.

JACK SPARROW
Nothing compares with the beauty of
the sea.

CARINA SMYTH
Don’t you ever look up?

JACK SPARROW
Only when I’m flat on my back. You
take your stars, and I'll take my
horizon.

CARINA SMYTH
They are forever connected. A map
maker’s sextant calculates the angle
between a star and the horizon. So
even if they are worlds apart, they
are forever entwined -- the stars and
the horizon existing as lovers.

AND NOW JACK STARES AT HER --
60.

JACK SPARROW
Lovers? As in we’re lost at sea and
tired of rowing and I won’t say a
word?

CARINA SMYTH
No. Lovers in the tragic sense. As
they are destined to never be
together.

JACK SPARROW
May I say that for someone with such
high intellect -- you have us
unequivocally lost.

CARINA SMYTH
You’re the only one who’s lost, Jack
Sparrow.

JACK SPARROW
I assure you I can smell land when
close by -- and I smell nothing --

HE SNIFFS THE AIR FOR A BEAT --

CARINA SMYTH
Land! Right on time.

JACK LOOKS BACK -- SEES AN ISLAND IN THE DISTANCE. HE SNIFFS
THE AIR AGAIN -- THEN HIMSELF --

JACK SPARROW
That might be me.

EXT. - CORONATION BAY. - DAY

JACK AND CARINA WALK THROUGH CORONATION BAY -- A BUSTLING
ISLAND PORT THAT IS PACKED WITH MERCHANTS PEDDLING THEIR
WARES TO SAILORS, PIRATES, AND TRADERS -- THE MOST VILE AND
VICIOUS LOOKING MEN EVER ASSEMBLED.

CARINA FOLLOWS JACK THROUGH THE ROUGH AND TUMBLE TOWN.

CARINA SMYTH
We need to find passage into the
Triangle --

JACK SPARROW
Luckily this is a very friendly place.
All you have to do is ask that group
of men for assistance -- and we shall
have ourselves a ship and a crew.

CARINA LOOKS OVER AT FOUR MEN --—

CARINA SMYTH
Me?
61.

JACK SPARROW
Bad luck for a man of the sea to ask
assistance of another sailor without
the intercession of a feminine gull.

CARINA SMYTH
Then I shall go right away. I’m glad
I can finally trust you.

JACK PULLS HER IN AND GIVES HER A KISS -- HOLDING HER FOR A
BEAT. When he pulls back she stares at him -- confused.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
Why did you do that?

JACK SPARROW
For luck.

CARINA WALKS OFF TOWARD THE MEN -- AS JACK PULLS OUT HER MAP -
- WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM HER DURING THE KISS.

HE QUICKLY TURNS AND RUNS INTO THE FIRST PUB HE CAN FIND --
EXT. — CORONATION BAY. - DAY

CARINA WALKS UP TO THE FOUR DISGUSTING TRADERS -- SMILES AT
THEM.

CARINA SMYTH
Gentlemen, my name is Carina Smyth --
and I am looking for a ship and a crew
to take me into the Devil’s Triangle.
Or more precisely, the Coffin Island --
which I have recently named -- and
which has never been seen by any man.

THE MEN STARE AT HER IN STUNNED DISBELIEF. HENRY MADDOX
STANDS IN THE SHADOWS -- STUDIES HER WITH GREAT INTEREST.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
May I also say that I am not a witch.
But I do have this map --

SHE REACHES FOR THE MAP -- SUDDENLY REALIZES IT’S GONE.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
The map? JACK!!!

AS SHE MOVES TO FIND JACK THE MEN STEP IN FRONT OF HER --
EYE HER WITH MENACING SMILES.

TRADER #1
Before you go, Miss. Would you mind
showing us your teeth?
62.

INT. - CORONATION BAY PUB. - DAY
JACK IS HIDING IN THE BAR WHEN HE HEARS --

CARINA SMYTH (V.O.)
HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

JACK GLANCES OUT THE WINDOW -- SEES CARINA BEING DRAGGED OFF
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET BY THE FOUR TRADERS. HE QUICKLY
TURNS BACK TO THE BAR -- HAS A DRINK.

JACK SPARROW

To trust.
JACK OPENS THE MAP -- TRIES TO READ IT. KEEPS TURNING IT
OVER IN HIS HAND -- NOT SURE WHICH WAY IT GOES --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
She's the only one who can read it.

A MAN'S VOICE CAUSES JACK TO TURN --

GAMBLER (V.O.)
I‘1l bet ten pieces.

GAMBLER #2 (V.O.)
And I'll raise this here sword --
washed ashore in Coronation Bay this
morning...

JACK HEARS THE WORD “SWORD” AND STARTS TO PANIC --
GAMBLER #2 (V.0.)
This is a fine saber! A double-edged
bone and steel cutlass with a slight
nick at the tip --

JACK DRINKING FROM A BOTTLE NOW -- FIGHTING WITH HIMSELF NOT
TO TURN AROUND. BUT HOW CAN HE RESIST?

HE STANDS UP AND STARES DOWN AT HIS SWORD --

GAMBLER #2
And what you be looking at?

JACK CASUALLY KNOCKS OUT THE TWO CARD PLAYERS AS HE LIFTS HIS
SWORD OFF THE TABLE --

JACK SPARROW
Destiny...

JUST AS A MAN WALKS INTO THE PUB -- MAKES AN ANNOUNCEMENT -—
MAN

Gentlemen -- the auction is about to
begin.
63.

EXT. - CORONATION BAY AUCTION. - NIGHT

TORCHES LIGHT UP A MAKESHIFT PLATFORM -- AN AUCTIONEER
STIRRING UP THE LARGE CROWD AS HE AUCTIONS OFF TWO DONKEYS.
MEN ARE DRINKING AND BIDDING WILDLY -- FIGHTS BREAKING OUT --

WE PAN OFF THE STAGE TO A LINE OF THREE WOMEN TIED TOGETHER
BY ROPE -- EACH OF THE WOMEN WEARING “FANCY” DRESSES. THEY
ARE WAITING TO BE AUCTIONED OFF -- A SIGN ABOVE THEIR HEADS
READS: WENCH AUCTION TONIGHT!

CARINA IS AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE, STUFFED INTO A REVEALING
RED DRESS WITH A HEAVY HAND OF MAKE-UP APPLIED TO HER FACE.
THE LOOK ON HER FACE IS PURE RAGE.

THEY PULL CARINA ONTO THE PLATFORM AND THE CROWD GOES WILD.

AUCTIONEER
First up is this fresh young lass --
come up here darling and turn about --
show us your larboard side.

CARINA TURNS AND KICKS THE AUCTIONEER IN THE BALLS. SHE
TURNS TO THE CROWD OF DISGUSTING TRADERS, PIRATES AND
SAILORS.

CARINA SMYTH
Let me just say that I forgive your
common dim-wittedness and feeble
brains incapable of educated --

THEY QUICKLY PUT A GAG IN CARINA’S MOUTH AS THE AUCTIONEER
STEPS FORWARD --—

AUCTIONEER
I will start the bidding at one pieces
of eight -- and with this one I’1l

throw in a goat.

WE SEE JACK MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD -- GETTING RIGHT
UP FRONT WHERE CARINA CAN SEE HIM. WITH HER EYES SHE TELLS
HIM TO START BIDDING --

JACK REACHES INTO HIS POCKETS -- WHICH ARE EMPTY --

JACK SPARROW
This one looks of unremarkable stock --
hard to imagine any warmth coming off
those skin and bones. But alas --
I’ll bid one and let’s be done with
it!

AUCTIONEER
I have one pieces of eight!

A DISGUSTING MAN STANDS NEXT TO JACK -- HOLDS UP TWO PIECES
OF SILVER.
64.
DISGUSTING TRADER
I'll bid two.

JACK SPARROW
Three!

DISGUSTING TRADER
FOUR! !

JACK STEPS CLOSER TO THE BIDDER -- STARTS STEALING MONEY FROM
THE MAN’S POCKETS -- FLIPPING COINS TO HIMSELF AS HE
CONTINUES TO BID --

JACK SPARROW
FIVE!!

DISGUSTING TRADER
SIX!!

WITH EACH BID JACK IS STEALING MONEY FASTER AND FASTER -- ONE
HAND IN THE MAN’S POCKET AND THE OTHER IN HIS JACKET -—

JACK SPARROW

SEVEN! !

DISGUSTING TRADER
EIGHT!!!

JACK SPARROW
NINE! !

DISGUSTING TRADER
TEN!

JACK SPARROW
IF YOU HAVE TEN -- THEN SHE IS YOURS.
SHOW US YOUR COIN!

THE MAN REACHES INTO HIS POCKETS -- WHICH ARE EMPTY --

DISGUSTING TRADER
NOW WAIT A SECOND -- MY MONEY IS GONE!

JACK HOLDING UP THE MAN’S MONEY -- SHOWING THE ROOM HIS
COINS.

JACK SPARROW
ARE WE TO LET THIS MAN SWINDLE A
REPUTABLE WENCH AUCTION SUCH AS THIS!

AUCTIONEER
GET THAT CHEAT OUT OF HERE!

THEY REMOVE THE FAT MAN NEXT TO JACK -- START BEATING HIM AS
THEY PULL HIM OUT.
65.

AUCTIONEER (CONT’D)
Now the last of the bids was ten!
Going once! Going twice!

A VOICE FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM STOPS THE CROWD.

PIRATE
TWENTY!! AND LET IT BE DONE AT THAT.

JACK HEARS A PIRATE'S VOICE OFF IN THE DARKNESS --

AUCTIONEER
20!! SOLD!!

THE CROWD GOING WILD AS A VICIOUS LOOKING PIRATE MOVES
THROUGH THE CROWD -- STEPS UP AND TAKES THE END OF CARINA’S
ROPE. HE LOOKS UP AT HER AND SMILES WITH ROTTING YELLOW
TEETH --

PIRATE
You belong to me now.

CARINA IS TERRIFIED OF THE PIRATE -- STRUGGLING WITH HER
ROPES AS SHE’S TAKEN OFF THE PLATFORM -- YELLING THROUGH HER
GAG AS JACK WATCHES HER MOVE THROUGH THE CROWD.

EXT. - DOCKS OF CORONATION BAY. - QUEEN ANNE’S. - DAY

JACK FOLLOWS THE PIRATE AND CARINA AS THEY HEAD DOWN TO THE
DOCKS -- WATCHES THROUGH THE DARKNESS AS THEY BOARD A SHIP.
HE CAN SEE CARINA IN THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS -—
THE LAMP IS TURNED OFF INSIDE THE SHIP --

AND JACK QUICKLY CLIMBS UP THE SIDE OF THE SHIP -- REACHES UP
AND PULLS TWO PIRATES OVERBOARD AS HE USES THEM TO HELP
HIMSELF CLIMB ONTO THE MAIN DECK --—

HE SNEAKS ALONG THE DECK -- MOVES TO THE SIDE OF THE
CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS AND CLIMBS INTO A WINDOW --

INT. - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS. - NIGHT
JACK CLIMBS INTO THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS --
DROPS TO THE FLOOR AND SEES CARINA TIED TO A CHAIR -- STILL
TIED AND GAGGED --
A MATCH IS STRUCK -- THE LAMP IS LIT --
AND THERE’S BARBOSSA AND HIS MEN SITTING AND WAITING FOR HIM.
BARBOSSA
Evening, Jack. This be the witch
you're looking for?

BARBOSSA’S MEN DRAW WEAPONS -- SURROUND JACK FROM ALL SIDES.
CARINA LOOKS AT HIM -- TRIES TO TALK THROUGH HER GAG.
66.

BARBOSSA LIMPS OVER TO JACK -- LIFTS UP THE BLACK PEARL IN
THE BOTTLE --

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Do you recall why there was mutiny
aboard the Pearl all those years ago?

JACK SPARROW
I'll take a swag -- did it have
something to do with treasure?

BARBOSSA
No, we planned to take the ship from
you long before Cortez. Around the
time you rescued a British soldier --
his life barely a whisper.

JACK SPARROW
Eric the Pirate.

BARBOSSA
This was no pirate. He wore the red
coat of a soldier trained to kill our
kind. But you taught him our ways --
passed over your own crew to
commission him a ship.

JACK SPARROW
You still seem bitter, Hector.

BARBOSSA
Not me, Jack. Eric’s brother.
Captain Brand’s got a yearning to meet
you in the flesh. Although he won’t
be wearing his.

INT. - JACK’S SHIP (DYING GULL). - DAY
GIBBS IS AT THE WHEEL OF THE DYING GULL -- THE CREW HALF

ASLEEP ON THE DECK. THE MEN ARE CLEARLY DEPRESSED -- NOT
SURE WHAT TO DO AS THEY STARE OUT AT NOTHING.

SCRUM
Mutiny seemed like a very good idea at
the time.

PIRATE #1
I believe we were caught up in the
moment.

PIRATE #2
You think Jack would consider coming
back --

PIRATE #3

No harm in asking.
67.

MR. GIBBS
He’s probably dead from exposure. Or
eaten by sharks.

SCRUM
Very true. Hard not to feel a bit
responsible.

GIBBS LOOKS OUT TO SEA -- EYES WIDE AS HE SEES A MASSIVE
BRITISH WAR SHIP COMING UP VERY CLOSE BEHIND THEM.

GIBBS
Scrum, Jack always told me that if
something were to happen, you should
be Captain.

SCRUM
Me? He said that?

GIBBS
Them be Jack’s wishes. Now go and
take the wheel, son -- and take this

here hat. The hat of a Captain.
SCRUM TAKES THE HAT, PUTS IT ON.

SCRUM
This be my proudest moment indeed.

GIBBS
You deserve it.

CREW MEMBER
SHIP!!! OFF THE PORT! A BRITISH
GUNNER !
CREW MEMBER #2
SHE HAS A HUNDRED GUNS, CAPTAIN! WHAT
BE YOUR ORDERS?
GIBBS PATS SCRUM ON THE BACK.

GIBBS
Good luck.

INT. - DYING GULL. - LATER

THE BRITISH HAVE BOARDED THE SHIP BY FORCE -- THE PIRATES
LINED UP AT GUN POINT. SCARFIELD WALKS DOWN THE LINE.

SCARFIELD
Which of you men is Captain of this
vile ship!

SCRUM STEPS FORWARD, EXCITED.
68.

SCRUM
Me. That’s me.

SCARFIELD
Beat him first and longest.

INT. - BRITISH SHIP. - BRIG. -—- CONTINUOUS

The Pirates are brought down to the brig of the British ship,
are herded toward the BRIG. A BRUISED AND BATTERED SCRUM
STOPS WHEN HE SEES MELIA LOCKED IN A CAGE --

SCRUM
That be the witch from Port Royal.

PANIC SETTING IN AS THE PIRATES ARE SHOVED INTO THE CELL
ACROSS FROM THE CAGE.

SCARFIELD WALKS TO THE CAGE -- RAISES HIS GUN --

SCARFIELD
The race for the Trident is one the
British will not lose. Tell me where
to sail.

MELIA
We must find Jack Sparrow.

EXT. —- BARBOSSA’S SHIP. - QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE. - NIGHT

CARINA IS TIED TO THE MAST, LOOKING OUT AT THE STARS.
BARBOSSA LIMPS OUT TO HER -- REMOVES HER GAG AS HE HOLDS UP
THE MAP.

BARBOSSA
You'll pardon my forward nature, Miss,
but perhaps you can tell me how Jack
Sparrow come to hold a map such as
this?

CARINA SMYTH
I drew it.

BARBOSSA
There be no island in the Triangle.

CARINA SMYTH
No island you’ve ever seen. It hides
the Tomb of Poseidon.

BARBOSSA
I know an unfinished treasure map when
I see one. Now who holds the rest of
it?
69.

CARINA SMYTH
I’m not sure. I finished the equation
-- did everything right. It should be
here.

BARBOSSA
Equation?

CARINA SMYTH
Handed down to me in Galileo’s Diary.
An equation no man had ever solved --

BARBOSSA
To find a Map No Man Could Read?

BARBOSSA STANDS THERE NOW -—

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
I’ve heard of such a map. But this
can’t be it.

CARINA SMYTH
I copied that map from the stars,
where it was hidden for thousands of

years.

BARBOSSA
Impossible. No woman can read the
stars.

CARINA SMYTH
So you believe you know more of the
constellations than I?

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
On that I’d wager.

BARBOSSA
I'll happily untie your hands -- if
you can name one star.

CARINA SMYTH
Go on and choose.

AND BARBOSSA POINTS TO A SPOT IN THE SKY.

BARBOSSA
That one -- the brightest in the
North.
SHE STARES AT IT -- DOESN'T SAY A WORD FOR A LONG BEAT.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
I didn’t think so.

HE TURNS TO WALK AWAY.
70.
CARINA SMYTH
Carina. That is the star Carina.
Barbossa turns back to her now.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
The star which gave me my name.

Barbossa looks at the star -- then pulls his knife and walks

back to her. She closes her eyes -- waiting to be killed --

AS HE CUTS THE ROPES TO HER HANDS -- THEN GIVES HER THE BOOK.
BARBOSSA

I’m a pirate. Not a killer.

BARBOSSA YANKS THE EARRING FROM HER EAR -- HOLDS IT IN HIS

HAND AS HE WALKS INTO HIS QUARTERS -- SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND
HIM.
INT. - BARBOSSA’S QUARTERS. - CONTINUOUS

BARBOSSA WALKS INTO HIS ROOM, OPENS HIS DRAWER AND LOOKS AT
THE SMALL PORTRAIT OF THE WOMAN.

HE THEN TAKES OUT AN EARRING -- AN EARRING THAT IS IDENTICAL
TO CARINA’S. THE EXACT SAME CLOVER DESIGN. WE PUSH IN ON
BARBOSSA -- AND SUDDENLY IT LOOKS LIKE HE’S SEEN A GHOST.

INT. —- QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE. - BRIG. - NIGHT

JACK IS TIED TO A POST WITH THICK CHAINS SURROUNDING HIS
ENTIRE BODY -- ONLY HIS HEAD EXPOSED. HE HAS AN ITCH ON HIS
NOSE -- IS HOPELESSLY TRYING TO SCRATCH IT WHEN HE HEARS A
NOISE. HE QUICKLY LOOKS AROUND --

THE NOISE GETS LOUDER -- SOMETHING IS PUSHING ITS WAY OUT OF
LARGE WOODEN CRATE -- THE LID GETTING KICKED OPEN --

JACK SPARROW
Now that’s a big rat.

JACK WATCHES AS HENRY MADDOX COMES OUT OF HIDING -- THE YOUNG
STOWAWAY COMING OUT OF THE CRATE -- NERVOUSLY BACKING UP WHEN
HE SEES JACK IN CHAINS --
JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
You there, boy! Could you lend me a
hand?
HENRY SLOWLY WALKS TOWARD JACK --

HENRY MADDOX
I seek no trouble.

HENRY LOOKS DESPERATE -- HIS CLOTHES FRAYED --
71.

JACK SPARROW
You're a stowaway on a pirate ship.
Trouble is all that’s left. What is
your name?

HENRY MADDOX
Henry Maddox. I made my way to
Coronation Bay to secure passage back
to the Triangle.

JACK SPARROW
Back?

HENRY MADDOX
I was aboard the massacre of the
Monarch.

JACK SPARROW
So you survived Captain Brand?

HENRY MADDOX
As did a girl. I knew her less than a
day. But I promised her I'd find her -
- save her.

JACK SPARROW
A word of advice, Henry. Risking your
life for women in distress is a
laborious way to make a living. Much
better to cause the distress, kidnap
the women, then take a ransom.

HENRY MADDOX
I will rescue her.

JACK SPARROW
Being as your aspirations are to
rescue -- why not start with me?

HENRY MADDOX
I know not what you’ve done, Sir.

JACK SPARROW
It’s not what I’ve done -- it’s what
I’m about to do. And that is to
squeal like a parrot. STOWAWAY NAMED

HENRY!! STOWAWAY NAMED HENRY!!

HENRY MADDOX
SHHHHHH!! Quiet. Okay -- I’1l get
you out.

JACK SPARROW
There must be a key to these chains.

HENRY GRABS A CHIPPING HAMMER OFF THE WALL.
72.

HENRY MADDOX
I won’t be needing any key.

INT. - BARBOSSA’S SHIP. - SUNRISE

BARBOSSA LOOKS OUT AT CARINA ON THE DECK OF THE SHIP. HE
PUTS THE TWO EARRINGS IN HIS POCKET -- WALKS OUT TO HER AS
THE SUN RISES BEFORE THEM.

IN THE DISTANCE WE SEE THE TWO ROCKS THAT FORM THE BORDER OF
THE TRIANGLE --

CARINA SMYTH
Mr. Barbossa, what will you do with
Jack when we get there?

BARBOSSA
There's a price to pay for finding
things not meant to be found.

CARINA SMYTH
And Jack's life is that price?

BARBOSSA
I'll be trading an eye for an eye.
You may have the map -- but I’1l have
the key. In the shape of a diamond.

CARINA SMYTH
He’s a fellow pirate, is he not?

BARBOSSA
Do you desire to find the Trident?

CARINA SMYTH
More than you could know.

BARBOSSA
To what end, might I ask?

CARINA SMYTH
I will present it to the King -- hand
him his greatest treasure. And from
that day forward my name will be
pronounced with high regard. And I’1l
never be called a witch again.

BARBOSSA
So Jack's life is a reasonable
expense. Wouldn’t you agree?
And now he looks at her -- sees her concern.

CARINA SMYTH
You have no loyalty.
73.

BARBOSSA
A pirate’s life is spent loyal to the
sea.

CARINA SMYTH
The sea is not alive, Mr. Barbossa.
It cannot return favor.

BARBOSSA
Nor can any pirate.

CARINA SMYTH
So you feel nothing for any living
soul?

BARBOSSA
I'd be lying to pretend otherwise.

INT. - QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE. - BRIG. -— CONTINUOUS

JACK WATCHES AS HENRY MADDOX PREPARES TO STRIKE THE CHAINS --
THE CHIPPING HAMMER RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE LOCK HE’S AIMING FOR IS RIGHT BY JACK’S NECK.

JACK SPARROW
Have you ever defeated a lock before?

HENRY MADDOX
Never.

BARBOSSA’S MEN ARE COMING DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BRIG --—

JACK SPARROW
This would be an excellent time.

HENRY SWINGS THE HAMMER -- A DIRECT HIT AGAINST THE LOCK -—-—

BARBOSSA’S MEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS -- AS HENRY TURNS
THE HAMMER ON THEM -- QUICKLY TAKES ONE OF THEM OUT --

THE SECOND PIRATE DRAWING HIS SWORD --

AS JACK USES HIS BROKEN CHAINS TO FLIP THE PIRATE ONTO HIS
BACK -- KNOCKS HIM COLD. HE TAKES BOTH OF THEIR SWORDS --—
TOSSES ONE TO HENRY -—

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Are you as good with a sword as you
are with a hammer?

HENRY MADDOX
I’ve never actually had a sword of my
own. I was a Captain’s servant --

JACK TAKES THE SWORD BACK FROM HIM -- GIVES HIM THE HAMMER.
74.

JACK SPARROW
Follow me. We’re taking the ship.

HENRY MADDOX
The two of us?

JACK SPARROW
I do it all the time.

EXT. —- QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE. - SUNRISE

Barbossa looks determined as he sails toward the boundary of
the triangle. THE BLACK PEARL SITS IN THE BOTTLE NEXT TO
HIM.

HIS ENTIRE CREW STANDING BEHIND HIM -- GROUPED TOGETHER --
ALL WAITING FOR THE MOMENT THEY CROSS OVER.

BARBOSSA
There be plenty of room at the bow.

THE MEN DON’T MOVE A MUSCLE.

THE WINDS PICK UP ON THEIR OWN NOW -- THE SEAS STARTING TO
CHURN BENEATH THEM -- THE CURRENT STARTS TO PULL THEM IN -—-—
AS A HEAVY FOG ROLLS IN AND DARK CLOUDS FORM OVERHEAD --

CARINA LOOKING AT THE DARKNESS ALL AROUND HER -- THE DAY
ALMOST TURNED TO NIGHT -- AS SHE SLOWLY BACKS UP --

CARINA SMYTH
Mr. Barbossa -- are you afraid of
ghosts?

BARBOSSA
Only when they’re armed.

THE SHIP GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE BORDER -- THE STORM
MOVING IN HARD AND FAST --

WAVES LASHING THE REVENGE AS THE WIND STARTS TO BLOW IT
TOWARD THE TRIANGLE -—

AS A SWORD IS SUDDENLY PLACED AT BARBOSSA’S BACK --
JACK STANDING BEHIND HIM --—

JACK SPARROW
I'll be taking the Pearl, Hector.

BARBOSSA
I'd be careful, Jack. This sword is
the only thing that’s keeping us from
crossing those rocks.
75.

JACK SPARROW
Rejig the row. We won’t be sailing in

today.

BARBOSSA
I've waited a lifetime to hold the
Trident.

AND NOW BARBOSSA TAKES OUT HIS SWORD -- TURNS TO SQUARE OFF
WITH JACK -—-

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
And I'm willing to risk the same.

JACK SPARROW

Then let’s finish this once and for

all.
THE TWO MEN CIRCLE EACH OTHER -- ABOUT TO FIGHT --
AS CANNON FIRE SUDDENLY RIPS THROUGH THE REVENGE -- MEN
TOSSED IN ALL DIRECTIONS AS JACK AND BARBOSSA ARE BLOWN
ACROSS THE SHIP -- BOTH DAZED FOR A BEAT AS THEY LOOK OUT
THROUGH THE SMOKE --
AND THERE’S THE BRITISH WAR SHIP COMING ALONG SIDE --
JACK AND BARBOSSA SLOWLY GETTING TO THEIR FEET --
BARBOSSA’S SWORD HAS BEEN KNOCKED ACROSS THE DECK --

BARBOSSA
A British gunner.

PINTEL
She's got a hundred guns, Captain!

BARBOSSA
Take the wheel, Jack. Killing each
other will have to wait.

MORE CANNON FIRE RIPS INTO THE QUEEN -- BARBOSSA SCREAMS TO
HIS CREW --

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
DRAW THE MAIN!! SHE'LL CURSE THE DAY
SHE CHARGED THE REVENGE! !

BARBOSSA RAISING HIS SWORD -- USING THE WIND --

JACK GOING TO THE WHEEL -- TURNING THE SHIP AS FAST AS HE CAN
- FIGHTING THE CURRENT --

MORE CANNON FIRE COMING IN NOW -- SHOT AFTER SHOT TEARING UP
THE REVENGE --

THE PIRATE CREW LOADING THEIR GUNS --
76.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
FIRE AT WILL -- AND LET THOSE DEVILS
FEEL YOUR SWAY!

CANNONS LIT --

THE PIRATES FIRING BACK NOW --

EXPLOSIONS TEARING THROUGH THE BRIG OF THE ESSEX -- SCRUM,
GIBBS AND THE OTHER PRISONERS KNOCKED BACK IN THEIR CELLS -—

MELIA’S CAGE IS BLOWN OPEN -- THE DOOR BROKEN OFF.

THE WITCH CALMLY STEPS OUT -- AS IF SHE KNEW THIS WOULD
HAPPEN --

BOTH SHIPS EXCHANGING FIRE -- A FULL SCALE BATTLE TAKING
PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE TRIANGLE --

METAL HOOKS THROWN ACROSS AS THE SHIPS ARE JOINED -—-
AS MEN FROM BOTH SHIPS SWING ACROSS --
SWORDS AND GUNS OUT NOW AS PIRATES FIGHT WITH SOLDIERS --

JACK FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE WITH BARBOSSA -- WHO HAS HIS
BLUNDERBUSS OUT --—

CARINA KEEPING HER EYES ON THE WATERS OF THE TRIANGLE -- THE
RAGING STORM PULLING THE TWO WARRING SHIPS ACROSS THE
BOUNDARY --

CARINA LOOKING THROUGH THE HEAVY FOG IN FRONT OF THEM NOW --
SEEING THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THE SILENT MARY --

PIRATES AND SOLDIERS STILL ENGAGED IN FULL BATTLE AS CARINA’S
TERRIFIED SCREAM ECHOES THROUGH THE TRIANGLE --

CARINA SMYTH
SHIP!!!!

SOLDIERS AND PIRATES SEE THE GHOST SHIP EMERGING FROM THE FOG

MEN WHO WERE STABBING AND SHOOTING AND KILLING EACH OTHER ARE
SUDDENLY VERY DISTRACTED -- THE FIGHTING COMING TO A STOP AS
THEY STAND TOGETHER AND WATCH THE SHIP --

PIRATES STEPPING BACK IN FEAR -- KNOWING WHAT’S COMING AS
BRITISH SOLDIERS LOOK CONFUSED.

SCARFIELD
FIGHT! I ORDER YOU TO FIGHT!!

BUT THE MEN JUST STARE AT THE SHIPWRECK COMING TOWARD THEM -—

THE SOUND OF BATTLE STOPPED NOW -- DEAD SILENCE TAKING OVER -—
77.

AS JACK STAYS AT THE WHEEL OF THE REVENGE --—

IN THE WATER WE SEE THE FACES OF THE DEAD -- GHOSTS STARING
UP AT THEM AND THEN VANISHING --

AS STEAM STARTS TO RISE OFF THE SEA -- THE WATER TURNING RED -

THICK FOG SURROUNDING THE TRIANGLE AS THE SILENT MARY DRIFTS
CLOSER --

JACK SPARROW
Can’t be good.

JACK EYES THE PEARL IN THE BOTTLE -- STARTS TO MOVE TOWARD IT

EVERYONE WAITING -- WEAPONS AT THE READY -- A MOMENT OF HIGH
TENSION --

ON THE DECK OF THE BRITISH GUNNER WE SEE ONE OF THE HEAVY
CANNONS SLOWLY TURN ON ITS OWN -- THE HUGE GUN NOW AIMED
DIRECTLY AT SEVERAL SOLDIERS ON THE RAIL --

AND THEN WE SEE OTHER CANNONS STARTING TO TURN AS WELL -- THE
GHOSTS MOVING THE CANNONS INTO POSITION --

WE SEE THE SOLDIERS’ GUNS COCKED ON THEIR OWN --

SWORDS LIFTED FROM THE BODIES OF DEAD SOLDIERS --

CANNONS LIT BY INVISIBLE HANDS, FUSES SLOWLY BURNING DOWN --
WE SEE THE ANCHOR OF THE REVENGE START TO UNCOIL -- AND NOW
SLOWLY RISE IN THE AIR LIKE A SNAKE AS IT STALKS SOME PIRATES
-- WAITING TO STRIKE RIGHT BEHIND THEM --

A LINE OF SWORDS SILENTLY MOVE TOGETHER -- STILL UNSEEN --

CANNONS ON BOTH SHIPS AIMED AT PIRATES AND SOLDIERS -- WHO
HAVE NO IDEA THEY ARE ABOUT TO BE ATTACKED FROM WITHIN -——

CARINA STEPPING TOWARD JACK AND BARBOSSA --

CARINA SMYTH
What’s happening?

BARBOSSA
We’re to be boarded now.

CARINA SMYTH
Jack...

BUT JACK IS ALREADY GONE -- TIP-TOEING BEHIND THE MAST -——
TRYING TO HIDE --
78.

AS CAPTAIN BRAND APPEARS ON THE FRONT OF THE REVENGE. HE’S
ALONE ON DECK -- EVERYONE EYEING HIM AS HE LOOKS AT THE
BRITISH SOLDIERS AND PIRATES -- A TRULY CAPTIVE AUDIENCE.

CAPTAIN BRAND?
So who would like to hear a tale?

BRAND STEPS FORWARD NOW -——

CAPTAIN BRAND
FIRE!!

AND NOW CANNONS FIRE -- RIPPING INTO THEIR OWN SHIPS AND MEN -

MASSIVE HOLES BLOWN IN BOTH SHIPS AS THE GHOSTS ATTACK THE
MEN WITH THEIR OWN WEAPONS --

GUNS START FIRING ON THEIR OWN -- SHOOTING THE MEN WHO ARE
HOLDING THEM --

SWORDS MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS THE DECK -- COMING AT MEN FROM
ALL ANGLES --

THE HEAVY ANCHOR SWINGS ACROSS THE DECK AND TAKES OUT FIVE
SOLDIERS -- KNOCKING THEM OVER THE SIDE -- CAPTAIN BRAND
SLOWLY WALKING TOWARD BARBOSSA --

HIS DEAD MEN WALKING BEHIND HIM --

PIRATES AND SOLDIERS THROWING THEMSELVES OVERBOARD IN FEAR -—

SCARFIELD SWINGS HIS SWORD HARD AT A GHOST -- TAKES HIS HEAD
OFF WITH ONE SWIPE --

AND NOW THE HEADLESS GHOST KEEPS COMING AT HIM -- THE HEAD
LAUGHING ON THE DECK --

SCARFIELD
RETREAT!!!

BRITISH SOLDIERS SWINGING BACK TO THEIR SHIP --

BUT AS THEY SWING BACK THEIR ROPES ARE CUT -- THE SOLDIERS
FALLING INTO THE WATER WHERE GHOSTS ARE WAITING --

OTHER SOLDIERS MAKING IT ACROSS -- BUT SWINGING STRAIGHT INTO
GHOSTS HOLDING SWORDS --—

THE MEN DROPPING INTO THE WATER -- WHERE GHOSTS QUICKLY DRAG
THEM DOWN --

THE BRITISH SHIP SINKING FAST AS THE BATTLE RAGES ABOARD THE
REVENGE.

HENRY MADDOX LOOKS ACROSS TO THE SILENT MARY --
79.
AND THERE’S OLIVIA STANDING ON THE DECK OF THE SHIPWRECK.
HENRY CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT WHEN HE SEES OLIVIA --

HENRY MADDOX
OLIVIA!!!

OLIVIA
HENRY! THEY’RE HOLDING ME CAPTIVE!!

HENRY MADDOX
I’M COMING FOR YOU!!!

HENRY TRIES TO GET TO THE MARY -- BUT GHOSTS ARE COMING AT
HIM FROM ALL SIDES AND HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO RUN --

CARINA BACKING UP IN HORROR -- TURNS TO RUN BUT IS BLOCKED BY
MORE DEAD MEN --—

JACK HIDING BEHIND THE MAST --

CAPTAIN BRAND
CEASE FIRE!!!

DEAD SILENCE NOW AS BRAND AND HIS MEN STAND BEFORE BARBOSSA -——

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Did you bring your end?

BARBOSSA SLOWLY NODS --

BARBOSSA
I‘’1l be needing the diamond.

BRAND PLACES HIS HANGER SWORD AT BARBOSSA’S THROAT -—

BRAND
When he’s dead.

AND NOW WE PUSH IN ON CAPTAIN BRAND AS HE SURVEYS THE SHIP.
CAPTAIN BRAND
I SPEAK NOW TO THE PIRATE JACK
SPARROW! SHOW YOUR FACE!!

JACK STAYS HIDDEN BEHIND THE MAST -- TERRIFIED. HE PEEKS OUT
TO SPY ON BRAND -- WHO HAS VANISHED --

PULL BACK

AND NOW WE SEE CAPTAIN BRAND DIRECTLY ABOVE JACK ON THE MAST -
- STARING DOWN AT HIM.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
I've been waiting to meet the rover
who sent me to hell and back.

JACK BACKING UP NOW AS BRAND MOVES TOWARD HIM WITH HIS SWORD.
80.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
The man who taught my brother the ways
of the pirate.

JACK SPARROW
I'm of the belief you can’t teach the
aptitude of piracy.

CAPTAIN BRAND
There be blood on your hands. Prepare
to wash them at the bottom of the sea.

THEY REACH THE WHEEL -- JACK BACKING INTO IT --

JACK SPARROW
As a statement of fact I did save
Eric’s life --

CAPTAIN BRAND
YOU LED ME TO SLAUGHTER THE ONLY
BROTHER I KNEW -- TURNED HIM AGAINST
HIS OWN!!

JACK SPARROW
Well, when you put it that way --

CAPTAIN BRAND RAISES HIS HANGER SWORD TO JACK -- BUT HE CAN’T
MOVE HIS ARM. BRAND QUICKLY LOOKS TO HIS LEFT NOW -- SEES
THE ROCK BOUNDARY OF THE TRIANGLE --

AND NOW WE SEE THAT JACK IS STEERING THE SHIP WITH HIS HANDS
BEHIND HIM -- HAS MOVED THE SHIP HALFWAY ACROSS THE LINE --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
I believe we’re no longer in the
Triangle. As I said -- impossible to
teach.
FOR A MOMENT JACK HAS SAVED HIMSELF --

EVERYONE WATCHING THE SAILS AS A LIGHT WIND STARTS TO BLOW
THE REVENGE BACKWARDS --

AS THE SHIP BEGINS TO MOVE JACK STARTS DESPERATELY BLOWING
WITH HIS MOUTH --

AS THE SHIP DRIFTS RIGHT BACK OVER THE LINE --

CAPTAIN BRAND GRABS JACK BY THE THROAT -- THROWS HIM ACROSS
THE SHIP --

BRAND'S MEN PICKING UP JACK -- HOLDING HIM AS BRAND DRAWS HIS
SWORD TO SLIT HIS THROAT --

CARINA SMYTH
Let him go.
81.
SILENCE NOW. JACK LOOKING AT CARINA -- SURPRISED AS SHE
STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS --

BARBOSSA WATCHING -- SEES THE WAY SHE LOOKS AT JACK --
WATCHING AS THE GHOSTS DRAG HER BEFORE BRAND --—

CAPTAIN BRAND
And who might this be?

JACK SPARROW
A witch -- or a wench. Depends who
you ask.

CAPTAIN BRAND
You took the life of someone I loved.
Allow me to return the favor.

JACK SPARROW
Love? Wait. Just to be clear --
we're not together.

CARINA SMYTH
He kidnapped me.

JACK SPARROW
And saved her life --

CARINA SMYTH
I believe I was making a point --

CAPTAIN BRAND
YOU CAN DIE TOGETHER --

BRAND LIFTS HIS SWORD --

BARBOSSA STARING AT CARINA -- REACHES DOWN AND GRABS HIS
SWORD -- THE WIND FILLING THE SAILS --

THE REVENGE MOVES QUICKLY BACK OVER THE LINE --

JACK AND CARINA SAVED FOR THE MOMENT -- RUSHING TOWARD THE
FRONT OF THE SHIP --—

BRAND TURNING TO BARBOSSA -- CLEARLY THE DEAL HAS CHANGED -—

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT'D)
SINK IT NOW!!

TWO OF BRAND’S GHOSTS GOING AFTER CARINA --

BARBOSSA RAISES HIS SWORD ONCE MORE AS JACK THROWS CARINA
INTO THE WATER --

THE GHOSTS UNABLE TO REACH HER -- GOING WILD WITH RAGE -——

THE GHOSTS TEARING UP THE SHIP AS CANNONS FIRE -- EXPLOSIONS
TEARING THROUGH THE REVENGE -—
82.
EVERYONE RUNNING TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE SHIP -- DIVING INTO
THE WATER --

JACK ABOUT TO JUMP IN THE WATER -- THEN REMEMBERS THE PEARL -——
GOES BACK FOR THE BOTTLE --—

HENRY MADDOX HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO DIVE INTO THE OCEAN --—

THE SHIP SINKING AS THE PIRATES JUMP TO ESCAPE THE GHOSTS -——
JACK HOLDING THE BOTTLE AT THE FRONT OF THE SHIP -—- ABOUT TO
JUMP OFF -- BUT BRAND GRABS HIM -- HOLDS HIM OUT OVER THE
SIDE -- ABOUT TO KILL HIM --

AND JACK REACHES HIS HAND INTO BRAND’S COAT -- PULLS OUT THE
DIAMOND -- SHOWS IT TO HIM.

JACK SPARROW
Very difficult to teach this.

AND JACK DIVES BACKWARDS AS FAR AS HE CAN INTO THE SEA --
ACROSS THE LINE OF THE TRIANGLE --

AND BRAND DIVES IN AFTER HIM -- BUT THE GHOST NEVER SPLASHES
DOWN -- WALKS ACROSS THE TOP OF THE WATER AND STARTS TO
SEARCH FOR JACK -- PULLING PIRATES OUT ONE BY ONE --

GHOSTS WALKING ACROSS THE WATER TOGETHER -- ALL OF THEM
SEARCHING FOR JACK --

AS A LINE OF FIRE STARTS TO RISE FROM THE SEA -- CAPTAIN
BRAND LIGHTING THE OCEAN NOW SO THAT IT BURNS -- STANDS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE FLAMES --

CAPTAIN BRAND
JACK SPARROW!!!

JACK DIVES DOWN -- GHOSTS TRYING TO REACH HIM UNDER THE SEA -——

SOME CREW MEMBERS GETTING SUCKED BACK INTO THE TRIANGLE BY
THE CURRENT -- GHOSTS WAITING -- UNABLE TO CROSS THE LINE --—

BARBOSSA USING HIS SWORD TO CLEAR THE SMOKE AND FOG --

AND NOW WE SEE THE ISLANDS THAT SURROUND THE TRIANGLE -- JUST
AS CARINA HAD SAID.

BARBOSSA
THERE! !

CARINA AND BARBOSSA SWIMMING TOWARD SHORE --

JACK FIGHTING THE CURRENT -- MAKING HIS WAY TO THE ROCKS AS
WELL --

CAPTAIN BRAND UNABLE TO REACH THEM -- STANDING IN THE FLAMES —
- TRAPPED IN HIS OWN WATERY PRISON --—
83.

CARINA AND BARBOSSA GET TO THE SHORE -- PULL THEMSELVES UP
WITH OTHER SURVIVORS --

JACK SURFACES HOLDING THE SHIP IN THE BOTTLE --

HALF THE CREW HAS MADE IT OUT OF THE WATER -- INCLUDING
PINTEL AND RAGETTI -- AS JACK SURFACES WITH THE BLACK PEARL
IN THE BOTTLE.

HENRY MADDOX LOOKS BACK AT THE WATER -- AT OLIVIA ON THE DECK
OF THE SILENT MARY AS IT DISAPPEARS INTO THE FOG --

HENRY MADDOX
OLIVIA’S ALIVE. I HAVE TO SAVE HER! !

HE TRIES TO GO BACK INTO THE WATER, BUT JACK HOLDS HIM BACK.

CARINA IS SHAKING -- STARING OUT AT THE FOG -- EYES FILLED
WITH TERROR -——

BARBOSSA
Stay on dry land if you wish to live.

CARINA SMYTH
Ghosts. Everywhere. I saw them.

JACK SPARROW
On a positive note -- I have yet to
see a lizard. Or a Quaker.

PINTEL
Where are we?

JACK SPARROW
These be the Coffin Islands -- as
named by the woman who found them.

BARBOSSA
This must be the burial grounds of
Poseidon.

AND NOW CARINA TURNS TO HIM -- QUICKLY SNAPS OUT OF HER FEAR.

CARINA SMYTH
The Trident is here.

JACK SPARROW
Then lead the way.

ALL THE PIRATES LOOK TO JACK AND BARBOSSA -- STAND FROZEN FOR
A BEAT.

RAGETTI
No woman is going to lead us? Ain’t
that right, Captain?
84.

CARINA LOOKS TO BARBOSSA -- WHO PULLS OUT THE MAP AND HANDS
IT TO HER. HE’S ABOUT TO SPEAK TO HIS MEN WHEN CARINA JUMPS
IN --

CARINA SMYTH
FALL IN LINE YA LAZY REPROBATES!
WE'RE OFF TO THE ISLANDS TO FIND THE
TRIDENT OF POSEIDON! !

CARINA STARTS WALKING -- THE MEN QUICKLY FOLLOWING.

AND NOW WE PULL BACK AND SEE THE COFFIN ISLAND -- AS DARK AND
FOREBODING AS THE NAME SUGGESTS. EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND
DYING -- THE ENTIRE PLACE LOOKS LIKE ONE BIG CEMETERY.

INT. - SILENT MARY. - DAY

SCARFIELD AND THE BRITISH SOLDIERS ARE ALL SOAKING WET AND
LINED UP ON THE DECK OF THE SILENT MARY. SCRUM, GIBBS AND
MOST OF JACK’S CREW ARE PRISONERS AS WELL.

GHOST
These are the survivors, Sir. Cowards
fished from the sea.

CAPTAIN BRAND MOVES DOWN THE LINE OF SOLDIERS --

CAPTAIN BRAND
Welcome aboard The Silent Mary.

THEY ALL LOOK TERRIFIED AS THEY LOOK AROUND THE SHIPWRECK -—
WATCH AS IT SAILS WITH ITS GHOSTLY CREW. THE SAIL RISES ON
ITS OWN -- THE WHEEL GENTLY TURNING WITH NO CAPTAIN -- MOPS
METHODICALLY SCRUBBING THE DECK --

GHOSTS APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE WALLS
AND COME THROUGH THE DECK WALK SIDEWAYS UP THE MAST OR
STAND ON TOP OF THE SAILS --

 

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Poseidon’s brother Hades was charged
with protecting the Tomb. And so he
formed the Triangle -- and enlisted
the dead to patrol it. Locking them
in forever.

CAPTAIN BRAND WALKS DOWN THE LINE NOW -- STEPS IN FRONT OF
SCARFIELD.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Which is good news for you men -- as
you won't be traveling far to the
gates of hell! Execute them all.

GHOSTS MOVING TOWARD THEM -- READY TO KILL THE PRISONERS --
85.

MELIA
No. We will need them alive for now.

MELIA STEPS TOWARD BRAND -- CALMLY STANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.

CAPTAIN BRAND
We? And why would a witch help a
spirit?

MELIA
I’ve been helping you from the
beginning. I engaged Jack Sparrow on
this quest, sent him to find the Map
and the Trident. I brought these

soldiers to you now -- so that our
destinies would live together. You
see, Captain Brand -- I’ve come to

make a deal.

CAPTAIN BRAND
Jack Sparrow has gone ashore -- there
are no deals to be made.

MELIA
You will bring me the Trident. And
with it you will have your freedom.
And the revenge you seek.

CAPTAIN BRAND
And what of your revenge?

MELIA
To all those who burned witches.
There is a storm coming.

CAPTAIN BRAND
You forget -- we remain locked to
these waters...

MELIA
I have the power to change that,
Captain.

EXT. - COFFIN ISLAND. - DAY

THE PIRATES ARE TERRIFIED AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE COFFIN
ISLAND. EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND DYING -- LIKE NO ISLAND WE’VE
SEEN BEFORE.

CARINA MARCHES THROUGH THE THICK BLACK FOREST -- THE BONES OF
DEAD AND DECAYING ANIMALS ARE SCATTERED UNDER DEAD TREES.
THIS IS A HAUNTED HOUSE THAT GOES ON FOREVER -- WITH STRANGE
NOISES AND SOUNDS CAUSING EVERYONE TO BE ON ALERT -—-—
86.

PINTEL
I wonder how she come to name this the
Coffin Islands.

RAGETTI
We are searching for the tomb of
Poseidon.

PINTEL

Seems obvious.

WE SEE A VENUS FLY-TRAP PLANT GRAB A PIRATE NEAR THE BACK --
THE MAN LIFTED AND SWALLOWED DOWN BY THE HUGE PLANT. NOBODY
SEES THIS HAPPEN --

RAGETTI
The Spanish word for coffin is ataud.
I'll wager it’s the name of a famous
Spanish explorer.

A SECOND PIRATE IS TAKEN BY A PLANT IN THE B.G. -—-

PINTEL
She doesn’t look Spanish.

THE BONES OF THE PIRATES ARE SPIT OUT BY THE PLANT -- AND
NOBODY SEES A THING.

SUDDENLY MORE VENUS FLY-TRAPS START TO ATTACK THE MEN --
SCREAMS HEARD NOW THROUGHOUT THE FOREST AS THE PIRATES TRY
AND GRAB THE LEGS OF THE DOOMED MEN --

BUT IT ALL HAPPENS SO FAST THERE’S NOTHING TO BE DONE. THE
PLANTS SWALLOW A FEW MEN DOWN -- THEN SPIT OUT THEIR BONES --

THE MEN HORRIFIED -- RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES AS THEY TAKE
COVER AT THE EDGE OF A CLEARING --

CARINA SMYTH
Stay together. We’ll rest here.

AS EVERYONE STOPS TO REST -- BARBOSSA PULLS JACK ASIDE AND
PLACES A DAGGER AT HIS THROAT --

BARBOSSA
The diamond, Jack. I saw you pocket
it.

JACK LIFTS THE DIAMOND FROM HIS POCKET --
JACK SPARROW

I’m confused, Hector. You made a deal
with the dead to trade my life for The

Eye -- only to save my life from the
very dead man who was supposed to take
it -- and now you wish to kill me dead

all over again.
87.

BARBOSSA TAKES THE DIAMOND -—

BARBOSSA
I never saved your life.

JACK SPARROW
I saw you raise your sword --

BARBOSSA
I DIDN'T SAVE YOU. AND LET THAT BE
THE END OF IT.

And Jack looks at him -- looks to Carina -- and he finally
realizes --

JACK SPARROW
You’re in love with her.

Barbossa stands frozen -- stares at Jack --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Not that it’s my business, but isn’t
she a bit young?

BARBOSSA
Hold your tongue, Jack. Before I cut
it out.

JACK SPARROW
As one who is recently married, I can
suggest you don’t rush into this --

BARBOSSA
ENOUGH! !

AND NOW JACK GRABS BARBOSSA’S HAND -- TURNS HIS WRIST OVER TO
EXPOSE A TATTOO OF A CLOVER.

JACK SPARROW
I’ve seen that clover before.
Dangling from Carina’s ear. Bad luck
for a sailor. But not a pirate named
Barbossa.

JACK STARING AT HECTOR NOW -—

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
And there were pirate markings in her
diary. Clover in shape next to the
equation. The question being, how did
she end up with a book that was once
in the possession of pirates?

BARBOSSA GRABS HIM NOW -- HESITATES FOR A BEAT -- REALIZES
HE’S GOT NO CHOICE.
BARBOSSA
Aye. The book was stolen by pirates.
Pirates who had no way of reading it.
So when it came to my hands thirty
years ago, I passed it down. As it
was all I had to offer.

JACK SPARROW
Passed it down?

BARBOSSA
To a three year-old child. The most
beautiful child you’ve ever seen. A
child I was never to lay eyes on
again.

Jack staring at Hector.

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
She's my daughter, Jack. Carina was
named by me, and then left with
nothing but a book stolen long ago.

JACK SPARROW
And a dead man’s tale of a father she
never knew?

BARBOSSA
Lies given to her by her mother so she
would never be faced with the truth of
what I am. And she took to those lies
and made them true -- studied by
herself until she alone could pull a
map from the stars. And now we both
chase the same treasure -- as our
destiny allows.

JACK SPARROW
You're certain of this, Hector? With
all respect, you’re one of the most
hideous men I’ve ever met. There be
little resemblance.

BARBOSSA
Her mother was a raven haired beauty --

JACK SPARROW
I know mirrors are hard to come by at
sea -- so you might not be aware of
your own unsightly face --

BARBOSSA
SHE’S MY DAUGHTER, JACK! AND THIS
SECRET WILL GO TO BOTH OF OUR GRAVES.
SHE MUST NEVER KNOW THE TRUTH!

88.
89.

JACK SPARROW
Sounds like an accord is to be struck.

BARBOSSA
Name your price.

JACK SPARROW
I only came for the Pearl and my life.

BARBOSSA
All I wish to hold is the Trident.

JACK SPARROW
We have an accord.

JACK AND BARBOSSA SHAKE ON IT -- BUT BARBOSSA PULLS HIS GUN
AND HOLDS IT TO JACK’S THROAT.

BARBOSSA
A small stipulation. I’ve seen the
way her eyes find you, Jack. You’ll
be staying away from Carina --
forever. She must never know the
pirate’s life.

Barbossa walking toward Jack now.
BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
Go near my daughter again -- and I’1l
kill you where you stand.
INT. - SILENT MARY. - DAY
MELIA HAS CUT HER HAND --
HER BLOOD POOLING ON THE DECK -- STARTING TO BOIL --
THE SOLDIERS AND PIRATE PRISONERS WATCHING IN HORROR --
SCRUM
If they offer you tea -- politely

decline.

MELIA BEGINS HER SPELL -- CHANTING AS BRAND LOOKS TO HIS DEAD
MEN -- WHO HAVE ALL FALLEN IN LINE.

CAPTAIN BRAND
Jack Sparrow and the Trident are
waiting to be taken.

GHOST SOLDIER
Sir, we are chained to these waters.

CAPTAIN BRAND
The Witch is casting a spell. Today
we're going ashore.
90.

And now they all look to the PRISONERS -- who have no idea of
what’s about to happen to them.

EXT. - COFFIN ISLAND. - TRIANGLE. - LATER

JACK IS STAYING FAR AWAY FROM CARINA NOW -- WALKING ON HIS
OWN -- PUSHES THROUGH SOME THICK BRUSH -- FIGHTING HIS WAY
THROUGH HEAVY PLANTS --

AND THERE’S CARINA -- WAITING FOR HIM. HE ALMOST WALKS RIGHT
INTO HER -- THE TWO OF THEM INCHES AWAY -—

CARINA SMYTH
I've been looking for you.

JACK TRIES TO MOVE PAST HER NOW --

JACK SPARROW
Don’t want anyone to see us together --
might think we’re conspiring --
colluding -- perspiring.

CARINA SMYTH
Is something wrong?

JACK SPARROW
We should keep moving. This island is
alive -- and so is Hector.

JACK STILL TRYING TO MOVE PAST HER -- KNOWS BARBOSSA WILL
KILL HIM ON SIGHT. BUT SHE WON’T LET HIM PASS.

CARINA SMYTH
Whatever happens, I just want you to
know that I was wrong about you, Jack.
You saved my life three times.

JACK SPARROW
I also kidnapped you -- induced your
sale into slavery. And let’s not
forget the tea -- the mutiny --

SHE MOVES CLOSER TO HIM NOW --—

CARINA SMYTH
I know I said the horizon and the
stars were destined to never be
together. But now I believe I was
wrong.

JACK SPARROW
No. Not wrong. You’re never wrong.
Have yet to see it --

CARINA SMYTH
Are you saying there’s nothing between
us?
gl.

JACK SPARROW
Did I tell you I was married? Happily
-- with two unbearable children.

CARINA SMYTH
I've spent my life looking to the
stars. Perhaps I should have been
looking out to sea.

CARINA GRABS HIM NOW AND KISSES HIM -- HOLDS HIM TIGHT -- AND
JACK IS QUICK TO GIVE INTO IT.

JACK SPARROW
I will admit, there is something
between us.

CARINA SMYTH
The Three Fingers of God.

JACK SPARROW
Well, I'd say you're exaggerating.

CARINA SMYTH
No, behind you! Those rocks line up
exactly as the stars of Orion! We’ve
found it!!

AND NOW JACK TURNS -- SEES HER MOVING THROUGH A CLEARING --
AND JACK IS TRULY RELIEVED TO SEE HER GO. HE TURNS AROUND --
BARBOSSA IS STANDING RIGHT THERE -- EYEING HIM SUSPICIOUSLY -—-

JACK SPARROW
God's finger -- shall we, Hector?

EVERYONE RUSHING TO SEE THREE TOWERING ROCK STRUCTURES THAT
RISE FROM THE ISLAND -- EACH ONE HUNDREDS OF FEET IN THE AIR.

CARINA LOOKING UP AT THEM -——

CARINA SMYTH
Orion is called the hunter. The stars
in the shape of a bow just as those
are formed. You see it now --

BARBOSSA
The question is -- what are they
hunting?

JACK SPARROW
They seem to be pointed at us.

PINTEL
There's a cave! Just behind the
rocks!

IN THE DISTANCE WE SEE A SMALL CAVE BEHIND THE TOWERING
ROCKS.
92.

CARINA SMYTH
That must be it. Come on!

BARBOSSA
Wait. Look to the top.

THEY ALL LOOK UP INTO THE FOG -- MAKE OUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A WOODEN STRUCTURE TWENTY FEET ACROSS --

PINTEL
Looks as if someone built a house of
wood on top of those rocks.

BARBOSSA
It’s not a house. It’s a nest.

JACK SPARROW
Carina -- did Poseidon have any pets?

AND NOW A MASSIVE BIRD SWOOPS DOWN THROUGH THE FOG -- PICKS
UP ONE OF THE PIRATES AND SAILS OUT OF FRAME --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
This is where I run.

THE PIRATE SCREAMING AS TWO MORE MASSIVE PRIMEVAL BIRDS
ATTACK -- THE SCREAMING CREATURES MOVING FAST AS EVERYONE
RUNS FOR THEIR LIVES --

THE BIRDS HAVE BEAKS LIKE RAZOR BLADES -- TALONS THE SIZE OF
DAGGERS -- THESE ARE DEAD WINGED SKELETONS DESCENDING FROM
THE SKY --

THE GIANT BIRDS PICKING OFF CREW MEMBERS ONE BY ONE -—
PULLING THEM RIGHT OUT OF THEIR BOOTS AND FLYING OFF TO THE
NESTS AT THE TOP OF THE ROCKS --

WE SEE A PIRATE DROPPED INTO ONE OF THE NESTS -- WHERE
SEVERAL “BABY” SIZED BIRDS ARE WAITING TO EAT HIM --

CARINA RUNNING FOR HER LIFE AS ONE OF THE MASSIVE HALF-DEAD
BIRDS COMES FLYING TOWARD HER -- GRABS HER BY THE SHOULDERS
AND IS ABOUT TO LIFT HER OFF THE GROUND --

BUT JACK COMES RUNNING IN BEHIND HER -- SWINGS HIS SWORD --
CUTS OFF THE BIRD’S FEET AS CARINA FALLS BACK TO THE GROUND --

THE SCREAMING BIRD TURNS TO COME BACK FOR JACK --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
ANGRY BIRD!! ANGRY BIRD!!

THE BIRD COMING AFTER JACK NOW -- BEAK OPEN AS IT TRIES TO
SLICE JACK IN HALF --

BUT A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- AND THERE’S BARBOSSA WITH HIS
BLUNDERBUSS --
93.

JACK GRABS CARINA AND THEY TAKE OFF RUNNING FOR THE CAVE -—
THE OTHER PIRATES RUNNING FOR COVER AS WELL --

THE GIANT BIRDS DESCENDING ON THEM AS THEY RUN --—

TWO MORE PIRATES PICKED CLEAN AS BARBOSSA KEEPS ON FIRING --—

THE GUNSHOTS CAUSING THE BIRDS TO DROP THE PIRATES -- TURN
BACK IN ANGER FOR HIM -——

BUT BARBOSSA STANDS HIS GROUND -- TAKES DEAD AIM AS TWO BIRDS
COME AT HIM AT ONCE --

HE PUTS A BULLET BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE FIRST --—

AND THE DEAD BIRD DROPS FROM THE SKY AND LANDS ON TWO PIRATES
-- CRUSHING THEM --

THE SECOND BIRD ABOUT TO TAKE OUT BARBOSSA -- WHO HAS FIRED
ALL HIS SHOTS -—-

THE BIRD REACHING FOR HIM WITH HIS TALONS --
AS JACK TACKLES BARBOSSA TO THE GROUND JUST IN TIME -—-—
THE BIRD CIRCLING BACK FOR THEM --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
I’1l need to borrow a weapon, Hector.

BARBOSSA
I’m out of charge.

JACK SPARROW
I have an idea. Don’t think you’1l
like it.
THE BIRD DIVING DOWN AT THEM --

AND NOW WE SEE JACK GET TO HIS FEET HOLDING BARBOSSA’S WOODEN
LEG --

JACK SLAMMING THE WOODEN LEG ACROSS THE BIRD’S BEAK -- THE
GIANT CREATURE CRASHING TO THE GROUND -- DAZED FOR A BEAT
WITH AN INJURED WING --

JACK STANDS THERE HOLDING BARBOSSA’S LEG --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
This is awkward --

AND NOW THE BIRD IS BACK UP --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
RUN! !
94.

BARBOSSA PUTS HIS LEG BACK ON AS HE AND JACK RUSH TO THE
ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AND DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE ROCKS -—

THE SURVIVING BIRDS CIRCLING THE ENTRANCE -- MUCH TOO BIG TO
ENTER -- THEN QUICKLY START TO EAT THE GIANT DEAD BIRD THAT
BARBOSSA SHOT.

INT. - CAVE. - DAY

JACK AND BARBOSSA ENTER THE CAVE WITH THE OTHER SURVIVORS --
exhausted and out of breath.

RAGETTI
What is this place?

CARINA SMYTH
This isn’t a place. The map ends
here. Look at the walls.

JACK AND BARBOSSA WALK DEEPER INTO THE CAVE -- STAND IN
STUNNED SILENCE AS A SHIMMERING LIGHT SHINES ACROSS THEIR
FACES. CARINA STEPS TOWARD THE LIGHT --

WE SEE THAT THE WALLS OF THE MASSIVE CAVE ARE COVERED IN
JEWELS. MILLIONS OF DIAMONDS COVERING THE WALLS -- STUCK IN
THE ROCKS AND SUSPENDED ALL AROUND THEM --

THE ENTIRE CAVE BATHED IN A WONDROUS LIGHT --

JACK SPARROW
Diamonds.

CARINA SMYTH
Those aren't diamonds. They’re stars.

INT. - BRITISH SHIP. - TRIANGLE. - DAY

MELIA IS CASTING HER SPELL, EXHAUSTED AS SHE USES ALL OF HER
MAGIC. THE BRITISH SOLDIERS HORRIFIED -- AS ARE SCRUM AND
GIBBS. MELIA NODS TO CAPTAIN BRAND -- WHO LOOKS AT HIS MEN --

CAPTAIN BRAND
Choose your legs.

AND NOW SOME OF THE GHOSTS WALK TOWARD THE PRISONERS. THE
MEN BACKING UP IN FEAR --

AS THE GHOSTS START TO POSSESS THE TERRIFIED BRITISH SOLDIERS
ONE BY ONE -- WE SEE THEM STEPPING STRAIGHT INTO THEIR BODIES

TWO GHOSTS STEP INTO GIBBS AND SCRUM -- WHO BECOME POSSESSED
AS WELL.

AS EACH PRISONER IS POSSESSED, THEIR EYES IMMEDIATELY TAKE ON
THE REFLECTION OF THE GHOST.
95.

WE SEE A NEWLY POSSESSED SOLDIER WALKING -- TRYING OUT HIS
LEGS -- WHILE ANOTHER TAKES A KNIFE AND CUTS HIS OWN HAND --—
FEELING THE PAIN AND SEEING THE BLOOD --

CAPTAIN BRAND STEPS INTO THE BODY OF ADMIRAL SCARFIELD -- AND
BRAND'S EYES BECOME SCARFIELD’S --

AND A GHOST ARMY IS CREATED BEFORE OUR EYES --—

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Move out. We’re going ashore!

INT. - CAVE. — DAY
CARINA MOVES TOWARD THE WALLS -- CAN HARDLY BELIEVE HER EYES.

JACK SPARROW
You're saying this is part of the map?

CARINA SMYTH
We’re standing inside it.

PINTEL
If we’re inside a map, then in theory
we could all get folded?

RAGETTI
Or rolled. That would be bad.

PINTEL
How do we read it?

CARINA SMYTH
It’s not to be read. It’s to be
completed. This cave -- these
diamonds -- it’s the solar system --
The Map No Man Can Read. Every star
exactly in its place. It’s all here --
we're seeing what God sees.

PIRATE #1
Witch! She’s a witch!

JACK SPARROW
We're past that.

PIRATE #2
Diamonds on the walls! What are we
waiting for!

A PIRATE RUSHES TO THE WALL -- TRIES TO PULL OUT A SINGLE
DIAMOND --

PIRATE #2 (CONT’D)
I'll be taking this one.
96.

SUDDENLY THE GROUND DROPS OUT FROM UNDER HIM -- AND THE
PIRATE DROPS STRAIGHT TO HIS DEATH -- SCREAMING AS HE FALLS
INTO THE ENDLESS DARKNESS --

Carina is moving toward the walls -- lost in thought --
CARINA SMYTH
That's the Milky Way, Orion’s Belt.
Coming across here is --
BARBOSSA
Carina. Bright enough to navigate
during a dead moon.
Carina looks back at Barbossa --

CARINA SMYTH
Yes. That is Carina.

JACK SPARROW
So which star are we looking for?

CARINA SMYTH
The one that’s missing. And it’s
right there -- that space on the wall.

RAGETTI
What is it then?

CARINA SMYTH
The third planet from the sun. Earth.
We're missing.

AND NOW BARBOSSA TAKES THE YELLOW DIAMOND EYE FROM HIS POCKET
-- HANDS IT TO CARINA.

BARBOSSA
Try this.

SHE TAKES THE DIAMOND AND WALKS TOWARD THE WALL -- SLOWLY
REACHES UP AND PLACES THE DIAMOND INTO THE CARVED SPACE.

IT FITS PERFECTLY -- RIGHT WHERE THE PLANET EARTH BELONGS.

THE LIGHT SHINING ACROSS CARINA’S FACE NOW AS THE ENTIRE CAVE
GLOWS YELLOW --

CARINA SMYTH
The Map is complete.

A NOISE IS HEARD -- A RUMBLING -- PARTS OF THE FLOOR FALLING
OUT AS PIRATES DROP STRAIGHT DOWN --

THE BACK OF THE CAVE BURSTING OPEN -- THE BACK WALL STARTING
TO CRUMBLE TO CREATE AN OPENING AT THE BACK OF THE CAVE.

THEY ALL SHIELD THEIR EYES NOW AS THE SUN STREAMS THROUGH -—
97.

AND NOW THEY ALL WALK TOWARD THE LIGHT -- THE NEWLY EXPOSED
OPENING --

EXT. —- TOMB OF POSEIDON FORTRESS. - DAY

THEY ALL WALK OUT OF THE CAVE -- STAND IN SILENT AWE AS THEY
STARE ACROSS AT A MASSIVE FORTRESS THAT PROTECTS AN ANCIENT
TOMB. FORTY FOOT WALLS STAND IN FRONT OF THEM -—

BARBOSSA
The Tomb of Poseidon.

JACK SPARROW
One question. Any birds?

THE ENTIRE COMPOUND IS MADE OF STONE AND GOLD -- A TREASURE
FIT FOR THE GODS. CARINA LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE FORTRESS --

EXT. - ISLAND AROUND THE TRIANGLE. - DAY

THE GHOSTS ARE COMING ASHORE INSIDE THEIR HUMAN COUNTERPARTS —
- SOME OF THEM TRY TO WALK ON THE WATER AND SINK STRAIGHT
DOWN -- THE POSSESSED MEN SWIMMING ASHORE AND THEN MOVING
QUICKLY ONTO LAND AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY ONTO THE ISLAND -—

CAPTAIN BRAND
You men are now vulnerable to gun and
sword. And if your flesh and body
dies -- you’re to join its rotten
spirt in hell.

CAPTAIN BRAND LOOKS TOWARD THE TREES --

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT'D)
MOVE OUT!! WE LIVE AGAIN!!

INT. - TOMB OF POSEIDON. - CONTINUOUS

CARINA LEADS JACK, BARBOSSA AND THE CREW INSIDE THE WALLS OF
THE TOMB COMPOUND -- MOVE THROUGH A SECOND CLEARING THAT
LEADS TO THE ANCIENT GOLD TOMB -- STATUES AND ORNAMENTAL
CARVINGS ALL AROUND IT.

CARINA SMYTH
It’s real, isn’t it?

BARBOSSA
You found it, Carina. Nobody else
dare say it was them -- for it bea

lie as great as any told.
She looks at him now --

JACK SPARROW
Shall we take a peek?
98.

BARBOSSA
OPEN IT MEN!

FOUR OF BARBOSSA’S PIRATES ALL WORK TOGETHER TO LIFT THE
HEAVY LID -- PULLING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT TO SLOWLY PUSH IT
ASIDE. THEY FINALLY GET IT OPEN --

AND THERE INSIDE, FLOATING IN PRISTINE BLUE WATER, IS THE
TRIDENT OF POSEIDON. THE GOLDEN SPEAR SPARKLES, IS EDGED
WITH JEWELS -- AND THEY ALL STARE DOWN IN QUIET DISBELIEF.

CARINA SLOWLY REACHES IN AND TAKES IT OUT -- HOLDS IT IN HER
HANDS -- KNOWS SHE HAS FINALLY FOUND IT --

HER MOMENT OF GLORY BROKEN AS THE TRIDENT BEGINS TO SHAKE -—

CARINA SMYTH
What’s happening?

SUDDENLY A NOISE IS HEARD -- LIKE THE CLINKING OF A GLASS --
EVERYONE LOOKING AROUND TO FIND IT --

AND JACK LOOKS DOWN AT THE SATCHEL PINTEL IS HOLDING --
REACHES IN AND TAKES OUT THE BLACK PEARL IN THE BOTTLE -——

JACK SPARROW
The Trident controls the sea --

THE OCEAN INSIDE THE BOTTLE STARTING TO REACT TO THE TRIDENT -
AND NOW THE BOTTLE CRACKS AND A TRICKLE OF WATER COMES OUT --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
My water broke...

JACK RUNNING WITH THE BOTTLE -—-

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
IT’S COMING!!

JACK HOLDING THE BOTTLE IN FRONT OF HIM AS HE RUSHES BY THE
PIRATES --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
IT’S COMING!!

THE GLASS BEGINS TO SHATTER -- AND NOW JACK’S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CLEARING YELLING AT SOME OF THE PIRATES WHO ARE CLOSE BY

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
RUN! !

THE PIRATES CONFUSED -- BUT IMMEDIATELY START TO RUN AS JACK
DROPS THE BOTTLE AND THE GLASS EXPLODES --
99.

AND THE BLACK PEARL SHIP STARTS TO SHAKE AND EXPAND AND GROW
BEFORE OUR EYES --—

THE SHIP RISING QUICKLY AS IT BUILDS AND BUILDS --
JACK DIVING TO ESCAPE HIS GROWING SHIP --

AND THEN IT’S FINALLY DONE. THE BLACK PEARL IS LYING IN THE
CLEARING WHICH SURROUNDS THE TOMB --

JACK STARING AT IT -- WALKS OVER -- REACHES DOWN AND PICKS IT
UP.

AND NOW WE SEE THE SHIP IS ONLY FOUR FEET LONG. LOOKS LIKE
SOMETHING YOU’D BUY IN A TOY STORE.

JACK PICKS IT UP -- HOLDS HIS SMALL SHIP FOR A BEAT --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Perhaps I was wrong. Maybe size does
matter.

THE SMALL ANCHOR DROPS DOWN -- LANDS ON HIS FOOT. AND NOW
JACK LOOKS AROUND -- ALMOST EMBARRASSED AS HE HOLDS UP HIS
SHIP.

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
I think she needs a little more water.

BACK AT THE TOMB --

CARINA LOOKS AT THE TRIDENT IN SHEER AWE -- UNTIL A SWORD IS
PLACED AT HER THROAT.

BARBOSSA
Now hand it this way. The discovery
belongs to you. But that Trident is
mine.

BARBOSSA HOLDS HIS SWORD ON CARINA --

CARINA SMYTH
I can see it in your eyes -- you will
not kill me.

BARBOSSA
Never trust the eyes of a pirate.

CARINA SMYTH
Then run me through, Captain Barbossa.
And prove me wrong.

BARBOSSA
For the last time --

CARINA SMYTH
What will you do with it?
100.

BARBOSSA
Sell it to highest bidder. As is my
right.

CARINA SMYTH
How could you give up a treasure like
this without a thought? Can you not
see it’s perfect? What kind of man
are you?

BARBOSSA
A pirate. Never to change.

SUDDENLY JACK TURNS -- SEES 50 GHOST SOLDIERS COMING OVER AND
THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE FORTRESS -- THE POSSESSED MEN
SCREAMING WITH VOICES OF THE DEAD --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
ATTACK!

THE GHOST OF CAPTAIN BRAND LEADING THE CHARGE IN SCARFIELD’S
BODY --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD (CONT'D)
YOU MEN SAILED INTO HELL -- NOW HELL
COMES LOOKING FOR YOU!
JACK RACING THROUGH THE MAZE OF THE FORTRESS --
CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD (CONT'D)
Find the Trident. And bring me Jack
Sparrow!!
BARBOSSA SEES THE GHOST ATTACK -- GHOSTS COMING TOWARD HIM --
HE LOOKS TO CARINA -- WHO TAKES OFF RUNNING WITH THE TRIDENT.

BARBOSSA HESITATES -- THEN TURNS TO THE GHOSTS WHO ARE COMING
TOWARD HIM --

BARBOSSA
LET'S SHOW ‘EM HOW TO BLEED!

BARBOSSA DRAWS HIS SWORD -- HIS CREW FIGHTING BACK -- A
HORRIBLE BATTLE RAGING AROUND THE TOMB --

CARINA RACES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE COMPOUND AND INTO THE
woOoDs.

HENRY MADDOX SEES HER GOING -- CHASES AFTER HER --
BARBOSSA SLICING HIS WAY THROUGH THE POSSESSED MEN -—
AS THE BRITISH SOLDIERS (GHOSTS) DIE, WE HEAR THE SCREAMS OF

THE GHOSTS -- ALONG WITH THE PERSON THEY POSSESS -- BOTH
DYING TOGETHER --
101.

JACK RUNNING WITH THE SMALL PEARL -- COMES FACE TO FACE WITH
GIBBS AND SCRUM. JACK RELIEVED TO SEE THEM --

JACK SPARROW
Gibbs, Scrum -- we’ll have to fight
our way out.

THE MEN STARE AT HIM -- THEIR GHOST EYES GLARING AT JACK AS
THEY RAISE THEIR SWORDS -——

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
You both look a bit pale. Are you not
well? A touch of Scurvy perhaps?

JACK WATCHES IN HORROR AS THEY RAISE THEIR SWORDS -- SCREAM
AS THEY COME STRAIGHT AT HIM --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
I can see you're still upset with me --

JACK FIGHTING OFF GIBBS AND SCRUM -- TRYING NOT TO KILL THEM -
- BUT TRYING NOT TO GET KILLED AS THEY ATTEMPT TO CUT HIS
THROAT --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)

VERY UPSET!! I'VE BEEN MEANING TO
DISCUSS YOUR WAGES!! SHALL WE DOUBLE
THEM! !

THE GHOSTS FIGHTING HARD -- JACK CHASED BACK THROUGH THE TOMB
FORTRESS -- USING HIS SWORD TO PROTECT HIMSELF -- MANAGES TO
CUT SCRUM’S HAND --

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
OKAY -- TRIPLE!! FINAL OFFER!

JACK RUNNING FROM THEM NOW -—

BARBOSSA IS FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE WITH HIS MEN -- SWORD IN
HAND -- CUTTING THROUGH GHOSTS SOLDIERS ONE BY ONE --—

AS HE MOVES TO THE CLEARING HE SEES CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD --
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM -- AND TWO MEN IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO
CIRCLE EACH OTHER --—

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
We had a deal, Captain Barbossa.

BARBOSSA
It would seem a ghost and a pirate
should avoid doing business.

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
Today I am no ghost. But soon you
will be.

CAPTAIN BRAND OPENS HIS COAT -- REVEALING SCARFIELD’S PISTOL.
102.

BARBOSSA’S HAND MOVING TOWARD HIS BLUNDERBUSS --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD (CONT'D)
You will pay for your betrayal.

AND NOW BARBOSSA SEES CARINA RUNNING ACROSS THE CLEARING
TOWARD THE WOODS --

HE FLASHES BACK TO A MOMENT IN TIME -- A THREE YEAR-OLD GIRL
STANDING IN A WINDOW HOLDING A SMALL BLACK DIARY --

A YOUNG BARBOSSA WATCHING HER AS HE HEADS TO SHORE -- A
WAITING SHIP -- LEAVING HER FOREVER --

BARBOSSA
Aye. A betrayal it was.

THE TWO MEN DRAW THEIR GUNS -- BOTH FIRE AT THE SAME TIME -——
AND NOW WE SEE BARBOSSA DROP TO THE GROUND --
BLOOD POOLING ON HIS SHIRT --

AS A WOUNDED BARBOSSA LIES BACK AND STARES UP AT THE STARS --
LOOKS STRAIGHT UP AT CARINA -- THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE SKY.

CAPTAIN BRAND WALKING TOWARD HIM -- ABOUT TO FIRE A SECOND
SHOT TO KILL HIM --

BUT SUDDENLY A SWORD COMES THROUGH BRAND -- WHO SCREAMS IN
AGONY -- TURNS TO SEE JACK SPARROW STANDING BEHIND HIM --

SCARFIELD STEPPING BACK -- TOUCHING THE BLOOD -- CLEARLY
WOUNDED AND ENRAGED --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
This repugnant flesh does me no good.

JACK COMING AT HIM AGAIN -- BUT BRAND’S MEN STEP IN FRONT OF
HIM -- FIGHT HIM OFF --

GHOST SOLDIER
SHE HAS IT, SIR!! THE TRIDENT IS
GETTING AWAY!

AND NOW BRAND LOOKS OUT TO THE WOODS -- SEES CARINA IN THE
DISTANCE --

HE REMOVES JACK’S SWORD -- HOLDS IT AS HIS OWN AS HE YELLS TO
HIS MEN --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
THE TRIDENT IS ON THE ISLAND! FIND
THE GIRL!
103.

EXT. - COFFIN ISLAND. - DAY

HENRY MADDDOX AND CARINA ARE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST -—
TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT.

THE GHOST SOLDIERS SPREADING OUT AS THEY CUT THROUGH THE
TREES -- LOOKING FOR CARINA --

CARINA SMYTH
This way. Hurry!

THEY TURN TOWARD THE BEACH -- SEE A LONG BOAT AT THE SHORE.
THEY BOTH RUSH TOWARD IT -- ABOUT TO MAKE IT TO THE SAND -—-

ONLY TO BE CUT OFF BY GHOST SOLDIERS -- THE SMALL ARMY
BLOCKING THEIR PATH.

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD -- CLEARLY INJURED -- COMES THROUGH
THE TREES AND APPROACHES CARINA. HE REACHES DOWN AND TAKES
THE TRIDENT FROM HER HAND -- HOLDS IT UP --

THE SILENT MARY SAILS TOWARD THE SHORE --

GHOST
Should we kill them?

AND BRAND LOOKS AT CARINA --

CAPTAIN BRAND/SCARFIELD
I want them to see this.

EXT. — TOMB OF POSEIDON. - DAY
JACK RUSHES TO BARBOSSA’S SIDE -- HELPS HIM UP.

JACK SPARROW
Where’s the Trident?

BARBOSSA
I let her go, Jack. This time I’1l1
never get her back.
INT. - SILENT MARY. - DAY

THE GHOST SOLDIERS BRING CARINA AND HENRY ON BOARD THE SILENT
MARY -- PLACE THEM IN THE HULL --

ALL OF THE GHOSTS STEPPING OUT FROM THE BODIES THEY POSSESS --

THE LIVING SOLDIERS DROPPING TO THE DECK -- HALF CONSCIOUS
AFTER THE GHOSTS DEPART --

THE GHOSTS STEP OUT FROM SCRUM AND GIBBS AS IF THEY'RE
STEPPING OUT OF OLD COATS -- THE PIRATES DROPPING TO THE
FLOOR --

DOWN IN THE HULL --
104.

HENRY LOOKS ACROSS INTO THE DARKNESS -- SEES OLIVIA HIDING IN
FEAR.
OLIVIA
Henry --
HENRY MADDOX
I said I'd come back -- we'll escape
together.
OLIVIA
Please -- you have to go.

HENRY MADDOX
I won’t leave you again. From the
moment I saw you, I knew where my
destiny lies --

OLIVIA
It’s not safe.

HENRY MADDOX
You're forgetting. I’m lucky.

CAPTAIN BRAND STEPS OUT OF SCARFIELD’S WOUNDED BODY --
IGNORES THE INJURED, DYING ADMIRAL AS HE TAKES THE TRIDENT --
STEPS TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE SHIP NEXT TO MELIA.
MELIA

The sea is yours, Captain. Take your

revenge.
CAPTAIN BRAND LOOKS TO THE ISLANDS -- LIFTS THE TRIDENT NOW --
AND NOW WE SEE THE FULL POWER OF THIS ANCIENT SPEAR --
THE OCEAN IMMEDIATELY STARTS TO SURGE --

THE WATER QUICKLY DRAWING AWAY FROM THE ISLANDS -- THE
BEACHES SUDDENLY EXPOSED --

BRAND RAISING THE TRIDENT LIKE A CONDUCTOR --

AS A TIDAL WAVE STARTS TO FORM -- THE MASSIVE WAVE RISING UP
IN FRONT OF BRAND’S SHIP -- THE GHOST ORCHESTRATING THE WAVE
WITH THE TRIDENT AS HE SENDS IT TOWARD THE ISLAND --

THE WAVE GROWING TO A HUNDRED FEET AS IT BUILDS AND BUILDS --

CARINA WATCHING FROM THE HULL -- HORRIFIED AS SHE SEES WHAT’S
ABOUT TO HAPPEN --

CAPTAIN BRAND
Goodbye, Jack Sparrow.

AND THE WAVE FINALLY CRASHES DOWN ON THE ISLANDS --
105.

WATER FLOODING EVERYTHING -- TREES TORN FROM THEIR ROOTS AS
THE FOREST IS SPLIT OPEN AND THE RAGING WATER SPREADS ACROSS
THE ISLAND --

EXT. — TOMB OF POSEIDON. - DAY

JACK HEARS IT COMING -- LOOKS TO BARBOSSA -- AND THE TWO MEN
WATCH AS A MASSIVE WAVE COMES CHARGING TOWARD THEM --

JACK SPARROW
TAKE COVER! !

JACK HOLDS HIS SHIP -- RUSHES TO BARBOSSA AND THROWS HIMSELF
ON TOP OF HIM --

AND NOW THE WATER CRASHES OVER THE FORTRESS AND SWALLOWS UP
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH --

THE WAVE SO STRONG IT COMPLETELY COVERS THE ENTIRE TOMB OF
POSEIDON --

THE TOMB BROKEN APART -- STONE AND GOLD EVERYWHERE AS WE SEE
IT SINK IN A MATTER OF SECONDS --

THE ENTIRE ISLAND UNDERWATER NOW -- NOTHING IS LEFT --
JACK AND BARBOSSA ARE GONE --
EXT. —- SILENT MARY. —- CONTINUOUS

CAPTAIN BRAND WATCHES AS THE ISLAND DISAPPEARS BEFORE HIS
EYES -- EVERYTHING GONE AS THE SEA RAGES AND A STORM BLOWS IN

NOTHING LEFT BUT WATER AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE --

MELIA
You're free, Captain. The boundary is
gone.

SHE WALKS OVER -- STANDS WITH HIM -—-

MELIA (CONT'D)
A witch and a ghost shall rule it all.

CAPTAIN BRAND LOOKS TO HIS MEN -——

CAPTAIN BRAND
My very dead men -- listen to your
Captain. From this moment on, every
ship at sea is ours to destroy! Every
sailor, pirate and soldier is ours to
kill. We will not stop until the
oceans of the world turn to blood!
106.

EXT. —- OPEN OCEAN. - DAY

WE PUSH IN ON A SPOT IN THE OCEAN -- A SINGLE BUBBLE POPS TO
THE SURFACE --

AND THEN A FEW MORE --

QUICKLY WE SEE THE WATERS START TO CHURN AND BUBBLE -- AND
SUDDENLY A MASSIVE SHIP IS RISING UP FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE
SEA.

JACK AND BARBOSSA CLINGING TO THE DECK OF THE BLACK PEARL AS
IT RISES OUT OF THE WATER --

THE MASSIVE SHIP NOW COMPLETELY RESTORED --

THE TWO MEN HOLDING ONTO THE DECK -- JACK CLINGING TO LIFE AS
HE GASPS FOR AIR. SEVERAL CREW MEMBERS HAVE SOMEHOW GRABBED
ONTO THE SHIP AS WELL, INCLUDING PINTEL AND RAGETTI.

JACK GETS TO HIS FEET -- LOOKS AROUND AT THE BLACK PEARL -—

JACK SPARROW
See -- just needed a bit more water.

JACK SEES BARBOSSA LYING UNCONSCIOUS ON DECK --
JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)

Hector...are you dead? Don’t answer
that if you are. Maybe I should slap

you -- always wanted to slap you --
Jack goes to slap him -- but Barbossa catches his hand.
/ BARBOSSA
Carina?
Barbossa lifts himself up -- struggles to get to his feet.

JACK STANDS NEXT TO HIM -—- THE TWO OF THEM LOOK OUT AT THE
SILENT MARY IN THE DISTANCE -- WATCH AS THE GHOST SHIP HEADS
OUT TO SEA --

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
She's gone, isn’t she?

JACK SPARROW
The dead took her. And the sea.

BARBOSSA
I keep making the same mistake, Jack.
Finding things not meant to be found.

SUDDENLY THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT COMING FROM THE SILENT
MARY -- A REFLECTION WAY OFF IN THE DISTANCE --—

BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
What is that?
107.

EXT. —- SILENT MARY. —- CONTINUOUS

AS THE SILENT MARY SAILS TOWARD THE BOUNDARY -- WE SEE CARINA
ON DECK -- THE SUNLIGHT HITTING THE CHRONOMETER AROUND HER
NECK AND REFLECTING ACROSS THE SEA --—

EXT. - BLACK PEARL. - CONTINUOUS

JACK SEES THE REFLECTION IN THE DISTANCE -- KNOWS IMMEDIATELY
WHAT IT IS.

JACK SPARROW
Hector -- she’s alive.

BARBOSSA
Then there be only one question. Is
this still the fastest ship at sea?

EXT. - SILENT MARY. - CONTINUOUS
SCRUM AND GIBBS SLOWLY WAKE UP FROM THEIR POSSESSION -- SEE
CARINA SITTING NEXT TO THEM.
GIBBS
Excuse me, Miss, my clothes are all
wet -- any idea how that might have
happened?
SCRUM

And I seem to be missing my little
finger. Sliced clean off at the tip --
very strange.

Scrum holds up his bloody hand.

CARINA SMYTH
Will you help me escape?

EXT. - BLACK PEARL. - CONTINUOUS

THE BLACK PEARL IS SPEEDING TOWARD THE SILENT MARY -—- JACK
AND BARBOSSA STANDING TOGETHER AS THE PEARL MAKES HER MOVE.

INT. - SILENT MARY. -— CONTINUOUS
HENRY MADDOX IS MOVING THROUGH THE SHIP WITH OLIVIA --

OLIVIA
Henry -- wait.

HENRY MADDOX
Come with me now. We’1ll take our
chances at sea.

HE LEADS HER UP TO THE DECK -- WHERE CAPTAIN BRAND IS WAITING
-- HOLDS JACK’S SWORD IN HIS HAND.
108.

CAPTAIN BRAND
The Captain’s servant. Did you come
to hear another tale, boy?
BRAND THROWS HENRY A SWORD --
CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
Take your irons. So you can die like
a soldier.

HENRY LIFTS THE SWORD -- HANDS SHAKING AS SHE STANDS IN FRONT
OF THE CAPTAIN --

CAPTAIN BRAND LAUGHS -- AS DO THE OTHER GHOSTS ON DECK.

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
I am not afraid!

AND HENRY COMES AT HIM NOW -- CAPTAIN BRAND TOYING WITH HIM
AS HE EASILY FIGHTS HIM OFF --

THEY FIGHT FOR A BEAT UNTIL HENRY’S SWORD IS KNOCKED FREE --—
AND HENRY IS LEFT STANDING DEFENSELESS AGAINST THIS POWERFUL
GHOST --

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
I‘1l make this quick.

BRAND COMES AT HIM -- BUT OLIVIA JUMPS IN FRONT OF HIM -——

HENRY MADDOX
Olivia!!

THE SWORD GOES INTO HER -— AND BRAND QUICKLY REMOVES IT.
HENRY LOOKS DOWN -- SEES THERE’S NO BLOOD --

HENRY MADDOX (CONT’D)
Olivia?

HE LOOKS AT HER -- SEES THAT SHE’S NOT IN PAIN -- HAS NO
REACTION TO THE SWORD -—

OLIVIA
I’m sorry --

AND NOW HE STEPS BACK FROM HER --

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
You returned for a ghost.

AND ALL AT ONCE HE REALIZES -- SHE’S BEEN DEAD ALL ALONG.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
I was killed that night at sea. But
my last thoughts were of you.

HENRY TURNING BACK AS BRAND RAISES HIS SWORD --
109.
CAPTAIN BRAND
Now let’s finish this, boy.
CAPTAIN BRAND ABOUT TO KILL HIM -- STOPS WHEN HE HEARS --

GHOST SOLDIER
SHIP TO THE AFT!!!

BRAND SEES THE BLACK PEARL CHARGING UP FROM BEHIND -—

CAPTAIN BRAND
Sparrow!!

INT. - SILENT MARY. -— CONTINUOUS

Carina is MOVING THROUGH THE HULL OF THE SILENT MARY WITH
GIBBS AND SCRUM --—

GHOSTS COMING THROUGH THE WALLS -- COMING AT THEM FROM ALL
ANGLES AS THEY MAKE THEIR ESCAPE --

THEY RUN TO THE STAIRS -- CLIMB UP TOWARD THE BACK OF THE
SHIP -—-

AND THERE’S THE BLACK PEARL SAILING ALONG SIDE --

JACK SWINGS ACROSS FROM THE PEARL -- LANDS IN FRONT OF CARINA
-- SHOCK AND DISBELIEF ON HER FACE AS HE HANDS HER THE ROPE --

JACK SPARROW
See -- timing is everything.

CAPTAIN BRAND CHARGING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MAST -—- COMING
FOR HIM WITH THE OTHER GHOSTS --

CARINA, SCRUM AND GIBBS GRAB THE ROPES AND SWING ACROSS
TOWARD THE PEARL --

CARINA LANDING IN BARBOSSA’S ARMS -- BOTH OF THEM CRASHING TO
THE DECK --

JACK GRABBING A ROPE AS WELL -- BUT AT THE LAST SECOND IT
GETS CUT DOWN BY A SWORD --

JACK TURNING AROUND NOW -- THE ENTIRE SHIP OF DEAD MEN
STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM. AS THEY ALL MOVE TOWARD HIM --

CAPTAIN BRAND
No. He’s mine.

CAPTAIN BRAND STEPS IN FRONT OF JACK NOW --

JACK SPARROW
I’ve come for the Trident.

CAPTAIN BRAND
Then take it!
110.
AND BRAND BRINGS THE TRIDENT DOWN INTO JACK’S SHOULDER --
STABBING HIM --

JACK STEPS BACK FOR A BEAT -- DAZED AS HE LOOKS AROUND -——
THEN SUDDENLY REGAINS HIS SWAGGER --

JACK SPARROW

As I said -- can’t teach it.
AND NOW WE REALIZE -- GETTING STABBED IS EXACTLY WHAT JACK
WANTED --
AND JACK TAKES OFF RUNNING -- SPRINTS FOR A SECOND ROPE AND

SWINGS AROUND THE SIDE OF THE SILENT MARY --

LANDS HARD BACK ON THE BLACK PEARL --

BARBOSSA USING HIS SWORD TO FILL THE SAILS --

BRAND TURNING BACK NOW -- WATCHING AS THE PEARL SAILS OFF -——

CAPTAIN BRAND
BRING THIS SHIP ALIVE!!

THE MARY SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS ITSELF -- FULL SAILS APPEAR OUT
OF NOWHERE AS THE GHOSTLY SHIPWRECK TRANSFORMS INTO A WAR
SHIP -- THE SILENT MARY QUICKLY MOVING TOWARD THE PEARL.

EXT. - BLACK PEARL. - MOMENTS LATER

THE PEARL IS HEADING BACK TOWARD THE WATERS OF THE TRIANGLE -——
THE SPEEDY SHIP STAYING IN FRONT OF THE MARY --

JACK IS ON THE DECK OF THE PEARL -- GRABS THE TRIDENT AND
PULLS IT OUT OF HIS SHOULDER. HE SCREAMS IN PAIN -- HOLDS
THE BLOODY SPEAR IN HIS HAND -——

CARINA SEES THAT BARBOSSA IS INJURED -- HELPS HIM TO HIS
FEET. AS SHE DOES SHE SEES THE CLOVER TATTOO ON HIS WRIST --
STARES DOWN AT IT FOR A BEAT --

CARINA SMYTH
Why did you come back for me?

BARBOSSA
I came back for the Trident.

CARINA SMYTH
You’ve saved me twice.

CARINA EYEING HIM NOW AS HE PULLS HIS HAND AWAY --

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
If you have something you wish to say
to me, say it now before it can never
be said again.
111.

BARBOSSA TURNS HIS BACK NOW --

CARINA SMYTH (CONT'D)
Are you the one who left me Galileo’s
Diary? Who left me an equation to
solve?

BARBOSSA
I’M SHORT OF MEN AND RACING THE DEAD!
NO TIME FOR THE SQUAWK OF AN INSOLENT
WOMAN!

BARBOSSA CAN’T LOOK AT HER -—

CARINA SMYTH
Please -- what am I to you?

AND FOR A SECOND IT LOOKS LIKE BARBOSSA IS GOING TO TELL HER.
HE TURNS TO HER -- BUT HE CAN'T --

BARBOSSA
Carina -- what could you be to a
pirate?
CLOSE ON JACK --
He’s staring out at the sea -- a familiar look on his face --

the wonder of the ocean clearly in his eyes.

PINTEL
SHE’S GAINING ON US!

CARINA WALKING TOWARD JACK NOW -—-

CARINA SMYTH
Jack -- what are you doing?

JACK EYEING THE SEA -- THE HORIZON --

JACK SPARROW
No one should control her.

JACK RAISES THE TRIDENT HIGH IN THE AIR -- AND THE SEAS START
TO OPEN -- THE ENTIRE OCEAN SPLITTING APART BEFORE OUR EYES --

WALLS OF WATER HUNDREDS OF FEET HIGH SLOWLY EXPOSE THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA --

A SIGHT NO ONE HAS SEEN BEFORE --

CURTAINS OF WATER PUSHING THEMSELVES APART AS BIG AND SMALL
FISH DROP FROM THE SIDES -- FLOPPING TO THE SEA FLOOR --—

TOWERING CANYONS OF CORAL REEFS APPEAR AS THE WATER CONTINUES
TO PULL APART --
112.

ALL THE SHIPWRECKS OF THE TRIANGLE ARE REVEALED AT ONCE --
EVERY SHIP THAT BRAND HAS DESTROYED --

THE DARKEST CORNERS

AND BELOW IT ALL --
ALL OF THE WRECKAGE

THERE IS THE GOLDEN
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN

CARINA AND BARBOSSA

OF THE OCEAN NOW VISIBLE --

AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE SEA -- AMIDST

TOMB OF POSEIDON -- NOW RESTING AT THE

THE PEARL SAILING TO THE EDGE OF WHAT IS NOW A MASSIVE

WATERFALL -——

SCRUM LOOKING DOWN -- TURNS TO JACK -—-

SCRUM

The backside of water. Don’t see that

every day.

CARINA LOOKS AT JACK -- WATCHES AS HE GRABS A ROPE --—

JACK SPARROW

Lower me down, Hector.

CARINA SMYTH

Jack -- wait. There’s no coming back
from the bottom of the sea.

JACK SPARROW

Is this your way of saying you’d like

my hat?

CARINA SMYTH

You don’t have to do this.

JACK SPARROW

I have to put it back.

CARINA SMYTH

But the Trident is yours -- you have
everything now.

JACK SPARROW

This was my destiny. To find it and
die for it. Or something like that.
So hard to concentrate when a witch is

naked.

CARINA SMYTH

But you don’t believe in destiny.

Then I’ve

JACK SPARROW
got nothing to worry about.
113.

SUDDENLY THE SILENT MARY SAILS STRAIGHT INTO THEM -- AND
CAPTAIN BRAND APPEARS ON THEIR SHIP SWINGING HIS HANGER SWORD
TOWARD JACK --

CARINA SMYTH
JACK!!!

BRAND AND HIS MEN COMING TOWARD THEM --

AS CARINA RUNS AT JACK -- THROWS HER BODY INTO HIS AS THE TWO
OF THEM GO FLYING OVER THE SIDE OF THE PEARL AND RIDE A
MASSIVE WALL OF WATER STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA -
- A VERTICAL WATER SLIDE THAT PLUNGES THEM INTO THE SOFT SAND
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN --

THEY LAND IN A HEAP AT THE BOTTOM -- LOOK UP AT THE VERTICAL
WALLS OF WATER -—

A SAILFISH SLICES THROUGH THE CURTAIN -- ALMOST POKES A HOLE
IN JACK AS IT QUICKLY WITHDRAWS --—

JACK AND CARINA TO THEIR FEET -- LOOK OUT AT THE COUNTLESS
SHIPWRECKS THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE SEA FLOOR.

THEY STARE AT A SCHOOL OF SHARKS -- ON THEIR SIDES IN THE
BRIGHT SAND -- FLAPPING, DROWNING IN AIR. THE LIONS OF THE
DEEP REDUCED TO HELPLESSNESS.

CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D)
Look there.

IN THE SEA WALL before them, rising up like a canyon, they
see a huge BLUE WHALE swim lazily past. Like a fish ina
tropical aquarium, but on a scale of the pyramids.

JACK SPARROW
There it is.

IN THE DISTANCE -- THROUGH THE SHIPWRECKS AND HILLS OF
SEAWEED -- THEY SEE THE GOLDEN TOMB LYING IN THE SAND.

ABOVE THEM -- THE SILENT MARY CRESTS THE TOP OF THE SEA --
AND NOW SAILS STRAIGHT DOWN TOWARD THEM --

THE SHIP COMPLETELY VERTICAL AS CAPTAIN BRAND AND HIS MEN
STAND ON DECK -- EYEING JACK AND CARINA --—

JACK SPARROW (CONT’D)
Hurry.

THE TRIDENT IN JACK’S HAND AS THEY HEAD FOR POSEIDON’S TOMB -——
ALL AROUND THEM -- LOOMING -- THE VERTICAL WALLS OF WATER --
A TOWERING MENACE THREATENING TO RELEASE. THE SEAS HELD BACK
BUT FIGHTING TO BE FREE -——

NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES OVERHEAD.

EXT. - BLACK PEARL. - CONTINUOUS

BARBOSSA IS AT THE WHEEL OF THE BLACK PEARL -- STARES DOWN

SHE CUTS THE ROPE IN HIS HANDS -- SWINGS HER DAGGER TOWARD
BARBOSSA --

THE INJURED PIRATE FIGHTING HER OFF -- MELIA BACKING HIM UP -——

MELIA
‘Tis time to die.

BARBOSSA DRAWING BLACKBEARD'S SWORD -- TRYING TO FEND HER OFF

MELIA (CONT'D)
That sword will not save you --

SHE’S USING HER POWERS TO PUSH HIS SWORD TO THE SIDE --
LEAVING BARBOSSA WITH NO WEAPON.

EXT. - OCEAN FLOOR. - CONTINUOUS

JACK AND CARINA ARE RACING THROUGH THE SHIPWRECKS -- TREASURE
STREWN ABOUT -- THE CARGO OF EACH SHIP LYING UNTOUCHED AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SEA. THEY CLIMB A TALL BED OF SEAWEED AND
SLIDE DOWN THE OTHER SIDE --

THEY RUSH THROUGH THE NOW SUNKEN CAVE THAT HELD THE MAP --
JACK STOPPING FOR A BEAT TO EYE THE DIAMONDS ON THE WALLS --

CARINA SMYTH
JACK -- THERE! !

SHE MOTIONS TO THE GOLDEN TOMB IN FRONT OF THEM -- BOTH LOOK
BACK --

THE SILENT MARY IS SAILING ACROSS THE SAND DUNES AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SEA --—

EXT. - BLACK PEARL. - CONTINUOUS

BARBOSSA IS BACKING UP FROM MELIA. SHE’S GOT HIM CORNERED
NOW -- IS READY TO KILL HIM.

MELIA
Your secret is safe, Captain Barbossa.
She'll never know the truth. Dead Men
Tell No Tales.

SUDDENLY A KNIFE IS PLUNGED INTO MELIA’S BACK -- AND SHE LETS
OUT A HORRIBLE SCREAM -——
115.
HENRY MADDOX IS BEHIND HER -- THE KID IS HOLDING BLACKBEARD’S
SWORD -- HOLDS IT LIKE A SOLDIER --
AS SHE TURNS AND STABS HIM WITH HER DAGGER --
HENRY AND MELIA LYING SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DECK --—

HENRY LOOKS UP AS OLIVIA APPEARS BEFORE HIM. SHE’S WITH HIM -—
- HOLDING HIM --

OLIVIA
It’s okay. We’1ll be together now.
SUDDENLY WE SEE AGONY IN HENRY’S EYES -- AN AGONY NOT FROM
ANY PAIN --

HENRY MADDOX
I’m sorry. I can’t come with you.

HENRY SLOWLY SITS UP -- LOOKS AT HER. AND NOW SHE SEES HE’S
GOING TO LIVE. IT’S THE WITCH WHO HAS DIED.

OLIVIA
I'll be waiting.

SHE KISSES HIM -- A LONG KISS THAT SHE KNOWS WILL BE HER
LAST. SHE THEN SLOWLY STEPS BACK --

OLIVIA (CONT'D)
Forever.

EXT. - OCEAN FLOOR. - CONTINUOUS

JACK AND CARINA ARE AT POSEIDON’S TOMB -- BOTH STRUGGLING TO
PUSH THE HEAVY LID ASIDE --—

AS CAPTAIN BRAND APPEARS BEFORE THEM WITH JACK’S SWORD.
THEY STAND FROZEN BEFORE BRAND AND HIS DEAD MEN.

CAPTAIN BRAND
This is your sword, Jack Sparrow.

BRAND HOLDS JACK’S SWORD IN FRONT OF HIM --

CAPTAIN BRAND (CONT’D)
It will cut your throat -- exactly as
I cut my own --

JACK SPARROW
This was the part I was hoping to
avoid.

AND NOW BRAND LIFTS JACK’S SWORD -- JUST AS THE WITCH
PREDICTED -- SWINGS IT DOWN --
116.
BUT AT THE LAST SECOND JACK RAISES THE TRIDENT IN FRONT OF
HIM --

THE SWORD SLICING THROUGH THE TRIDENT -- SPARKS FLYING AS THE
TRIDENT IS CUT IN HALF --

WE SEE THE ANCIENT SCEPTER DROP TO THE SAND -—

EVERYTHING TURNING DARK AND GRAY --—

THE GROUND STARTING TO SHIFT -- THE SAND PARTING --—

AND A HOLE STARTS TO OPEN --

AS THE DEAD START TO CRAWL OUT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA --
ALL OF THE DEAD WHO WERE KILLED BY BRAND IN THE TRIANGLE --
sae eans NS OUT FROM THE DIRT AND MUCK AND OUT OF THE

SAILORS AND SOLDIERS ALIKE STANDING TOGETHER -- BRAND AND HIS
MEN NOW SURROUNDED BY THESE GHOSTS --—

GHOSTS WHO ARE LED BY ERIC BRAND -- WHO NOW HOLDS THE
TRIDENT.

ERIC
You killed these men. Sank their
ships. They died by your hand and
were forced through the gates of hell.

CAPTAIN BRAND
Eric -- brother -- we can be together
again. We can rule the sea!

ERIC
We will be together. Forever.

BRAND AND HIS GHOSTS BACKING AWAY NOW --

AS THE GHOSTS GRAB THEM -- PULL THEM BACK DOWN INTO THE
BLACKNESS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRIANGLE --

THE DEAD MEN FINISHING THEIR OWN TALE AS THE SCREAMING GHOSTS
ARE PULLED BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR -- SUCKED DOWN INTO THE
GATES OF HELL FOREVER --

CAPTAIN BRAND THE LAST TO GO -——

JACK AND CARINA SEE THAT THE WALLS OF WATER ARE STARTING TO
BUCKLE ALL AROUND THEM --

AND THEN JACK NOTICES SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE --

JACK SPARROW
There...
117.

IT’S AN ANCHOR DROPPED FROM THE BLACK PEARL --

AND AT THE END OF THE ANCHOR IS BARBOSSA -- HOLDING ON AND
SWINGING WITH HIS HAND OUT --

BARBOSSA
HURRY! !

THE WALLS OF WATER CAVING IN NOW --

AS JACK AND CARINA BOTH RUN TOWARD A CORAL REEF, JUMP UP AND
REACH FOR BARBOSSA AND THE BOTTOM OF THE ANCHOR --

THEY BOTH HOLD ON --

THE WALLS COLLAPSING IN AND THE OCEAN VIOLENTLY COMING BACK
TOGETHER --

AS BARBOSSA RAISES HIS SWORD -- USES ALL OF ITS POWER AS THE
ANCHOR SWINGS UP TOWARD THE SURFACE -- MOVING QUICKLY AS THE
SEA BEGINS TO COLLAPSE ALL AROUND THEM -—

AS JACK AND CARINA COME FLYING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE SEA --
ARE THROWN TO THE SIDE OF THE PEARL --

THE TWO OF THEM HOLDING ONTO THE SIDE OF THE SHIP -- CLINGING
TO THE RAIL --

AS THEY LOOK BACK DOWN INTO THE HOLE IN THE SEA --
WHERE BARBOSSA REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ANCHOR --

THE SEA HAS HIM NOW -- IS SURGING ALL AROUND AND IS STARTING
TO PULL THE ANCHOR DOWN WITH HIM --

THE BLACK PEARL STARTING TO TIP OVER AS THE SEA DRAGS THE
ANCHOR DOWN --

THE SHIP TEETERING ON THE EDGE -- ABOUT TO BE PULLED IN --

AND BARBOSSA KNOWS HE HAS NO CHOICE -- REMOVES HIS PIRATE HAT

AND WITH ONE MIGHTY SWING BARBOSSA USES BLACKBEARD’S SWORD TO
CUT THE ANCHOR THAT HE’S HOLDING --

CARINA SMYTH
No. NO!!!!

THE WALLS OF WATER CAVING IN ON HIM AS HIS EYES REMAIN FIXED
ON CARINA --

AND HECTOR BARBOSSA IS SLOWLY SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA --
AS THE BLACK PEARL RIGHTS ITSELF WITH A MIGHTY SPLASH --

THE FOG LIFTING ALL AROUND THEM --
118.

TO REVEAL A CALM AND PERFECT SEA --—

JACK LOOKING DOWN -- SLOWLY REACHES UP AND TAKES OFF HIS OWN
HAT.

JACK SPARROW
A Pirate’s life.

EXT. - BRITISH PORT. - DAY
WEEKS LATER
THE BLACK PEARL IS DOCKED IN A BUSY PORT.

SCRUM AND GIBBS ARE LOADING THE SHIP -- BARKING ORDERS AT
HENRY MADDOX -- NO LONGER DRESSED AS A SOLDIER. HE WEARS THE
CLOTHES OF A PIRATE AND HE CARRIES A SWORD.

SCRUM
Sand the keel and scrape those
barnacles, boy! Captain Sparrow won’t
tolerate any dallying!

HENRY MADDOX
Aye, Mr. Scrum.

GIBBS
Move it, Lucky. We're preparing to
sail with the sun.

HENRY MADDOX
Mr. Gibbs, is it true there be a pound
of gold waiting for each man?

GIBBS
Two pounds -- you’ll see!

AT THE DOCKS --

CARINA HOLDS A SUITCASE -- IS PREPARING TO BOARD A WAITING
COACH. JACK IS STANDING WITH HER --

JACK SPARROW
What is Oxford?

CARINA SMYTH
It’s a University. I’11 be the first
female astronomy student. Assuming
they believe my story.

JACK SPARROW
Oh, I think they’1l believe it.

CARINA SMYTH
And how can you be so sure?
JACK SPARROW
Maybe this will help.

AND NOW JACK HANDS HER “THE EYE” -- THE YELLOW DIAMOND

SPARKLING IN HER HAND.

CARINA SMYTH
What kind of pirate gives up his
treasure?

119.

AND NOW HE OPENS HIS OTHER HAND -- WHICH IS FULL OF DIAMONDS.

JACK SPARROW
Who said I’ve given anything up?

CARINA SMYTH
I'll keep this diamond with the hopes
that one day you’1ll do the right
thing.

JACK SPARROW
And what might that be?

CARINA SMYTH
You're a pirate. Steal it back.

CARINA GETS INTO THE COACH -- AND THE HORSES TAKE OFF.

WATCHES FOR A BEAT --—

INT. - COACH. - CONTINUOUS

CARINA SITS IN THE COACH WITH SOME VERY WELL DRESSED,
DIGNIFIED LOOKING MEN. SHE TAKES OUT A LEATHER FLASK
A LONG STIFF DRINK -- OFFERS THEM THE FLASK -——

CARINA SMYTH
Pirate’s tea, anyone?

THE MEN LOOK HORRIFIED AS SHE SITS BACK AND SMILES -——
OUT THE WINDOW OF THE COACH --

HER CLOVER EARRING DANGLING IN THE SUN.

EXT. —- BLACK PEARL. - DAY

JACK

-- HAS

LOOKS

THE SHIP IS STILL DOCKED AS JACK STEPS ON BOARD -- HANDS ALL

OF THE DIAMONDS TO SCRUM --
JACK SPARROW
As promised, give these diamonds to
the crew, Scrum.

SCRUM
Aye, Sir.

GIBBS WALKS UP TO JACK --
120.

GIBBS
Good news, Captain. One of the men
found this washed ashore in the
harbor. How’s that for luck?

GIBBS IS HOLDING JACK’S SWORD. JACK HESITATES FOR A LONG
BEAT -- THEN TAKES HIS SWORD AND PUTS IT IN HIS BELT -—

MR. GIBBS
So where we headed, Jack?

JACK SPARROW
We'll be following the stars, Mr.
Gibbs. Wherever they may take us.

GIBBS
It’s good to have the Black Pearl
back, is it not, Captain?

JACK SPARROW
I’ve been thinking, Gibbs. Perhaps
this ship could use a new name. A
name to strike fear into our enemies --
and bring us more treasure than we
could imagine.

GIBBS
And what name did you have in mind,
Sir?
EXT. - BRITISH HARBOR. - SUNSET
AS THE SHIP SAILS FROM THE HARBOR AND HEADS OUT TO SEA -- WE
TILT DOWN TO SEE THE NEW NAME ON THE BACK. CARVED INTO THE
AFT IS A SINGLE WORD --
BARBOSSA
EXT. - BARBOSSA. - CONTINUOUS
CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW IS AT THE WHEEL OF THE BARBOSSA --
SAILING TOWARD A PERFECT RED SUNSET. HE HAS HIS SHIP -- HIS
CREW -- NOTHING BUT THE OCEAN AND THE STARS IN FRONT OF HIM.

AS HE SAILS OFF TOWARD THE HORIZON -- THE PIRATE'S LIFE
CONTINUES --

FADE OUT:
