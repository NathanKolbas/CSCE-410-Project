VIKINGS

“VIKINGS”

FADE IN:
INT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT, L.A.)

We are at the perimeter of the ballroom where waiters and
busboys, in fancy short jackets with shoulder braids, deal with
dirty dinner dishes that have been cleared. They are arranging
trays and whisking them into the kitchen, etc. We HEAR:

PETE (0.S.)
«+. She had a vagina-ring...

AL (0.S8.)
I’m sorry, this is a girl Don set you up
with? What about her vagina?

PETE (0.S.)
It had a ring in it.

As we HEAR this chat we move into the ballroom and SEE that a
major ooh-ahh Hollywood affair is going on. Something for
charity: black tie, round overly set tables, a many-pieced band,
gala, flowers, rich people wearing expensive outfits, many in
attendance, etc. Dinner is over, people have left their tables
to dance and mingle.

AL (0.S.)
(pause)
For a reason? Not seriously?

PETE (0.S.)

Oh, very, very, very seriously.
ED (0.S.)

What’s a vagina-ring?
AL (0.S8.)

Pete -- really??
PETE (0.S.)

Al, yes, will you wait, Don fixed me up
last night with a girl - who - had - a -
vagina-ring...

AL (0.S.)
Um, who... i-is... that something you’re
looking for - a girl with a - uh...

ED (0.S.)
What’s a vagina-ring?
TABLE - CONTINUOUS
DON, from taking us on the above travels, arrives, sits, speaks:

DON
A ring you put your vagina on, so you
won't lose it.

At one of the tables remain ED, AL, Don and PETE, clad in tuxes.
Don and Pete are the two central of these four main characters;
they are in the entertainment industry - Don acts, Pete
screenplays. Ed is the innocent of the group - a successful
accountant. Al is a bit of a lovable fool, maybe even a small
idiot; he dresses a little too slick, which perhaps is an
affectation he adopted upon moving here; he holds his cell phone,
just holds it - a successful consultant. All four are the same
age (30-35), very dear childhood friends from N.Y. and have been
here about a year. Fate has brought them to L.A.

The conversation is very natural and quick paced. Everyone is
quite sincere except Don.

ED
-- How do you lose a vagina?

DON
This poor guy locks himself in a room for
six months to write a God-damn script.
His sort of dedication really should pay
off - it never does, but it really should
- he finishes the script, sells it, they
make it, the movie’s opening soon, his
first movie, I felt he deserved a good
time, so I set him up with this girl that
sleeps with most things and it slipped my
mind that she wears jewelry in her pants.

PETE
Hey Don, I'd like more than to just “get
laid”.

DON

I'd like there to be smart people.

PETE
I really thought you were having me meet
someone I might like to date. There was,
what I thought was, a lot of animal
attraction, and yes, it’s been a while,
so I just succumbed...

DON
When you succumb, do you scream out, “I’m
succumbing”? After I succumb, I always
AL
Do you come across a lot of these rings?

DON
That’s the only one I’ve seen in the
flesh but... hey, did I pun there?

ED
What’s a vagina-ring?

DON
(quickly to Ed)
A group of female smugglers.

ED

Really?

Pete gives Ed a look.

AL

Did you sleep with this girl?
PETE

No. Almost.
ED

Please tell me what a vagina-ring is.

PETE
(trying to end this)
It’s a ring you wear - in - your vagina.

ED
Were you fooling around down there and
came upon a ring that had slipped off
some other guy’s finger?

DON
Yeah that’s it - actually she’s got an
entire Tiffany’s Jr. down there - if you
need something nice for the wife.

PETE
(One more try, slowly)
Ed, she had a pierced vagina.

ED
Oh, that’s terrible! Was she in a car
accident or something?

DON
(gives it a try)
Earring - pierced ear, vagina-ring -
pierced vagina.
ED
No, come on seriously.

PETE
What did you do when you first saw it?

DON
Pulled it. I figured there was a string
attached and it would talk.

Unfortunately, Ed realizes he may now have the truth.

ED
Oh no-no-no-no-no. Stop it, stop it,
stop it, sto--

CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS

SILENTLY we SEE Pete fly backwards off a bed from between knees
in horror. He knocks into the bureau and sends things flying,
then into a wall, knocks over a lamp, etc. As Pete CONTINUES
speaking in VOICE OVER.

PETE (V.O.)
I took it in stride, of course. I mean,
I respect people’s right to make their
own choices...

ED (V.O.)
No-no-no-no-no...

CUT TO:
INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

ED
... Why not, ear - clip-on earring,
vagina - clip-on vagina ring??!!

DON
Did she give you that line about how in
India and Africa it wouldn’t be
considered unusual?

PETE
Yes.

DON
I told her, I don’t care if in ancient
times it was considered normal and
beautiful...
INT. BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS

Sitting on the same bed as Pete, same woman’s knees before him,
amazed expression on his face as he stares, Don CONTINUES in
VOICE OVER. We SEE his lips move in unison saying the words, but
the voice comes from the ballroom.

DON (V.0.)
.-. In ancient times they went around
shitting on the floor like dogs, but most
importantly - you’ve punched a hole in
your vagina...

CUT TO:
INT. BALLROOM —- CONTINUOUS

DON
.+. Then I took the ring out and fucked
her.

PETE
You're kidding??

DON
I’m sure you’re supposed to, I figured
otherwise I’d shred my dick.

ED
Please! Please! Tell me this is a joke -
I have a daughter!

AL
So if I were to give a girl a pair of
earrings, she might not wear them in her
ears?

DON
There was a time when you could count on
women to wear earrings in their ears, but
those days are long gone, baby. I know
this guy who gave his girlfriend a vagina
engagement ring.

AL
Did she want an engagement vagina-ring-
vagina engagement ring - whatever, or did
she want the usual kind?

DON
No, they were both highly into it. This
was the real deal, they’d go “I love you”
and everything, very romantic. The only
problem was, when word got out that they
ring. So he was always getting jealous -
which is unfair since he gave it to her
and she just wanted to show it off. Plus
she kept getting arrested for showing it
to people in public places. As you
probably guessed, they never got married.
Moral of the story, sometimes it’s best
to stick with tradition.

AL
Did she keep the ring? I guess they’re
pretty hard to return.

DON
And what girl’s gonna accept a used
vagina engagement ring? -- Even if it was

your grandmother's.

AL
(to Pete and Don)
What are you guys doing with your lives?
What kind of girls are you going out
with? Why don’t you go out with nice

girls?
DON
Are those the tattooed ones, or the ones
with fake breasts -- like your wife?
AL
My wife does not have fake breasts.
DON
Yes she does.
AL
No she doesn’t!
DON
Why don’t you squeeze them and get back
to me.
AL

They're fibrous!

DON
Look, you may not know your wife has fake
breasts, which is fascinating to me, but
I can inform you that your wife possesses
one pair of fake breasts.

AL
I asked her.
DON
Well, that settles that. The sun may not
rise in the morning, but women never lie.
Look at your wedding pictures. You
married a beautiful woman with ping-pong
ball-sized breast--

AL
Who had a miscarriage, which caused her
to have a hormonal reaction that made her
breasts grow...

DON
Overnight to the size of beach balls?

AL
It wasn’t overnight.

DON
Al, you went away on a business trip on
Monday, returned on Wednesday to a wife
with huge breasts.

A little boy, RALPH, (8-10), stands shyly by the table, holding a
pen and paper. Don notices him.

DON (cont’d)
Hi. Come here -- don’t worry about it.
I’m just some guy on TV. No big deal,
believe me.

Ralph uncomfortably approaches.

RALPH
Could I have your autograph?

DON
Of course, it would be my pleasure.
Thank you very much for asking. What's
your name?

RALPH
Ralph.

Don scribbles, then hands it back. Ralph, delighted and
appreciative, scurries back to his watching mother and father.
They gesture thanks to Don, he returns graciously.

DON
Let’s see how shameful it is by the bar.

BAR —- A MOMENT LATER

Against a wall is a bar. Ed, Al, Don and Pete stand at it.
DON
Anyway, so how’re your wife’s fake
breasts?

AL

My wife doesn’t have fake breasts!

DON
Yup, fake ones, yup, yup, yup, yup, yu--

WE HEAR the one-of-a-kind voice of a major movie star.

JESSICA (0.S.)
Who wants to buy me a drink?

They immediately halt and look to the voice. There, right there
stands JESSICA BLACK, gorgeous, dolled-up, one of the very
biggest stars in Hollywood, stinking drunk, pilled, etc.,
wobbling, wearing a very tight outfit, fake breasted - clearly.

ED
(sweetly)
They’re free.
DON

We'll insist upon paying - adorable guy.

The guys are only too delighted. The bartender has left to get
ice, Don reaches behind, grabs a bottle of wine, fills Jessica's
glass. The guys can’t help but hang on her every slurred word.

JESSICA
Does anybody know what the fuck charity
this is for anyway?

ED
Um, yes. This is a benefit for the
American Cancer Society. It’s an annual
event hosted by my firm. We invite
select members of the entertainment
community, such as yourself, who are good
enough to attend - and I hope this isn’t
rude, but my wife just adores you, you’re
her favorite movie star. Unfortunately,
she had to stay home with our daughter,
who has a sore throat, she’s going to be
so upset when she hears she missed you.
Do you think I could have an autograph?

DON
(to Ed)
You’re so cute.

ED
DON
You’re such a nerd - I love it.
(to Jessica)
Nice outfit.

JESSICA
You like it?
DON
Uh-huh.
JESSICA
You got good taste. Where you from?
DON
New York.
AL

We're all from New York.

JESSICA
Why do you feel that’s worth mentioning?
Shouldn’t someone who looks like you have
a cell phone hanging off the side of his
head, creating walls, in essence, between
you and us, and so giving us, in fact,
reason to be thankful? Excuse me.

She leans and sloppily, seductively whispers into Don’s ear, then
staggers off and out of the ballroom, taking four hearts and
eight testicles with her. Don counts, mouths the numbers.

ED
I can’t believe Jessica Black was right
here, talking to us - wait till I tell
Sue.

Al makes a call.
AL
She’s even more beautiful in person --
great breasts.

PETE
Yeah, well, you go for those real ones.

Don reaches sixty in his count, he follows Jessica.
EXT. POOL/DON & PETE’S HOUSE - DAY
Your basic on the small-sized pool in the Hollywood Hills, in it

Don lies motionless on a raft. There’s some patio furniture
around it, some view, a jacuzzi. Soon, DING DONG, the doorbell.
10.

DON
Fuck!
(yells)
COME AROUND BACK!

Soon, a lovely female form appears. Don must visor his eyes with
his hand to more clearly see DETECTIVE DREYFUS, beautiful,
extraordinarily built L.A.P.D. detective. She’s dressed
appropriately, but her large, fake breasts are prominently
displayed - but there'd be no way for them not to be. Yup, no
doubt about it, this is a cop with a boob job.

DREYFUS
Donald Miller?
(shows her badge)
Detective Dreyfus, L.A.P.D.

Don laughs, not buying this for a moment.

DREYFUS (cont'd)
Mr. Miller, I’m--

DON
Call me Don.

DREYFUS
Mr. Miller, I'm investigating the Jessica
Black rape and murder.

This is startling for a moment, but then Don undoubtedly
remembers that this is all a big joke.

DON
Oh, Jessica's dead?

DREYFUS
Yes. I’d like to ask you a few
questions.

DON
Fire away. Have a seat. You want some
coffee or something? You don’t mind if I
stay right here, do you?

She pulls up a patio chair to the edge of the pool.

DREYFUS
It’s my understanding you saw Jessica
Black the evening in question at a formal
functio--

DON
You want to come in? The water’s great.
11.

DREYFUS
Mr. Miller, I need to ask you a few
questions. I’m happy to do this nice.
You can lay there in your little pool and
get a little sun while we do this or I
can drag your little television ass
downtown and make sure the sun goes down
before I get around to you.

DON
Do you really expect me to buy this?

DREYFUS
What’s that, Mr. Miller?

DON
That you’re a cop?

DREYFUS
(shows her badge)
Detective Dreyfus, L.A.--

DON
Uh-huh.

DREYFUS
Okay, TV boy, why don’t you paddle over
here and have a look at the badge so we
can get on with this.

DON
I don’t know what the badge is supposed
to look like, but regardless, nothing is
going to make me believe you're a cop.
However, if you’re free tonight, maybe we
could have dinner.

Stone-faced, Dreyfus inhales a lot of air through her nose,
exhales, stands, then picks up the pool skimmer.

DREYFUS
Okay, star, out of the pool.

INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Don sits at a table, rants and raves, as Dreyfus and CAPTAIN
ABERNATHY stand.

DON
«+. I didn’t know she’d been killed! Why
don’t you phone ahead and let a guy know
when you’re sending around a policeman
that looks like her! How was I supposed
to know someone wasn’t playing a joke on
12.

ABERNATHY
I believe Detective Dreyfus showed you
her badge.

DON

It’s gonna be hard to find a badge in
this town?! The problem is that no one
could exaggerate enough to exaggerate
what it’s like to live here. If you
wrote a movie making fun of L.A., you'd
have a detective that looks like her.

ABERNATHY

Mr. Miller, we would appreciate some
cooperation. This is a high-priority,
high-profile case. One of the most
famous people in the world was raped and
strangled to death. We’re doing all we
can to keep things discreet. I think you
can appreciate we have our jobs to do.

DON
Am I a suspect??? If yes, I can take
care of this real quick, let me explain
something to you, I am not allowed to
commit murder, I am not allowed to be a
murder suspect, I am not allowed in the
vicinity of a murder!

DREYFUS
Who says?

DON
My mother! It’s inconceivable!
Absolutely inconceivable!

DREYFUS
We just want to ask you a few questions.
At the moment we’re talking to people.
You were in the vicinity of a murder!

DON
Yes! Yes - don’t tell my mother -
everybody there was. Now enough with
this, let’s move on to something less
ridiculous and much more important.
(to Dreyfus)
Are we having dinner tonight?

INT. CANTER’S DELICATESSEN - DAY

Don and Pete sit at a table on the old side of Canter’s. Don is
a little shaken, Pete, quite excited.
13.

PETE
... What are you talking about???!!! Are
you okay???

DON

Yeah, it’s just the strangest fucking
thing - as you know, not a day goes by
that I wouldn’t like to, but my mother
has forbidden me to commit murde--

PETE
Are you a suspect???

DON
Of course not. They wanted to “talk” to
me is all. People saw us together, I
guess. She came over - you know - she
was killed after that - I don’t know.

PETE
So they just wanted some information from
you ‘cause you were there.

DON
Yeah that’s it - whatever - I don’t want
to talk about it - moving on - new
subject - what’s going on with the movie?

Pete decides to go along with Don.

PETE
I’m getting nervous. I could see it if I
wanted, I just think it’1l be more fun to
see it with everybody else at the
premiere. I just hope it’s good. I was
so happy with the way the script turned
out. I’m proud of it and I don’t think
I've ever felt this way about something
I’ve written.

DON
Well, I’m sorry to hear that.

PETE
I really think these guys get it and
cared about doing a good job with it, so
I’m sure they did.

DON
Not likely - which guys?

PETE
The studio, the producer, the director--
14.

DON
Oh - no, no definitely not - but it is a
great script and - “it’s money” - as we

have no choice but to say all the time.

BOBBY, an actor, sadly the kind you find most of in L.A., sees
Don and Pete, comes over and sits down. Of course, he sports a

goatee.

BOBBY
Hey, Don man! Hiya, Pete! Mind if I sit
down? I may as well eat, I got some time
to kill. I just ducked in here to call
my machine and saw you guys. How you
guys doin’? Don, man, the show is great
and you’re great on it, congratulations,
man, you deserve it, man. You guys eat
here a lot? Hey, Don man, who casts your
sho--

DON
Yeah, this place reminds me of home.

PETE
Since when do you miss New York?

DON
I don't. I miss the deli. This place,
at least, has the ambiance down pretty
good, and the waitresses are pretty
authentic...

An old, fat, heavily Eastern European accented WAITRESS steps up
wearing a waitress’ uniform, a pink and white one. Call her

DEAR.

She walks

DEAR
What can I get you darlings?

DON
We're not quite ready, Dear. Give us a
few moments, if you would, Dear.

DEAR
Of course, darling.

away.

PETE
You know, it sounds very condescending
when you do that - “Dear”.

DON

No, it doesn’t. Where else can I call
15.

old Jewish man. Where else can I feel
like a grown-up in this town?

PETE
Fine. Fine. I’11 call her Dear too.

DON
Do that - and happy up, we’re celebrating
your impending movie premiere - the
mediocre pastrami sandwiches are on me.

BOBBY
Hey, that’s right, Pete man, your movie
opens soon. Congratulations, man - you
think I could get invited to that
premiere, Pete ma--

The absurdity that is Bobby forces Don to close his eyes, we
FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don and Pete on beautiful
green grass, realistically shot (this is not a dream sequence, no
haze or filters of any kind) jumping joyfully. We are here
briefly. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
Are we ready?
(calls out)
Dear.

Every waitress in the place thinks they’re being called, so turns
to Don.

DON (cont’d)
No - our “Dear”.
(to our Dear)
When you have a second, Dear.

BOBBY
Pete man, the premiere of your movie,
could I--
Dear steps up.
PETE
Hi, Dear.
DEAR

Hello, darling. Ready to order?

DON
Yes, please, thank you, Dear. Three
pastrami on rye, three Dr. Brown Cream
Sodas. And could you make sure sour
pickles.
(holding yellow mustard)
And could we get some real deli mustard,
16.

Dear. What’s with this place? It’s got
a lot of nerve calling itself a deli.

DEAR
(sympathizing)
Would you believe, the closest I got is
Gulden’s.
DON

Thank you very much, Dear.

DEAR
You're welcome darling.

Dear walks away.

BOBBY
So Don, who casts your show? Maybe you
could slip her my picture, I got one
right here.

Bobby gives Don an 8x10 headshot of himself with a resume stapled
to the back. Don looks at the photo.

DON
This doesn’t look anything like you, Bob.

INSERT - HEADSHOT
It’s remarkable how flattering this picture is.
BACK TO SCENE

BOBBY
Well I’m not spruced up right now - in
audition mode - but maybe you’re right.
Maybe I need some new ones; these are
about seven months old.

DON

Seven months? Did you set your face on
fire in the last seven months, Bob?
Maybe washed up with a little acid? Who
the fuck is this - your younger, better-
looking eighth cousin?

(shows Pete photo)
Pete, does this look like anyone at this
table?

PETE
(tentative)
It -- looks like Bobby.

DON
Pete, you’re not being mean when you tell
17.

really someone’s friend, you tell them
the truth. This is a very little-known
thing around here.

(to Bobby)
I'll be happy to give this to the casting
director, but what do you do when you
walk in the office and they actually see
you?

 

Don plays casting director, doing double takes at Bobby and the

photo.

BOBBY
Don, ma-—

DON

May I speak? This is a photo of what you
wish you looked like. This guy can’t get
any parts, because this guy can’t show
up, because this guy doesn’t exist. You
at least exist - the only thing you have
in common with this guy is you may not be
able to get any parts either.

PETE
You must be Bobby’s best friend.

BOBBY
Okay, I’1ll get some new ones, so you guys
dating anybody? I’m not. Can I confide
something to you guys? I can’t get laid -
cannot close. I don’t know what it is.
There’s something about the women in this
town...

DON
If they’re seeing your picture first,
they're definitely disappointed when you
show up.

PETE
Don, be serious, will ya?

DON
What? Is he paying me, Mr. Nice?

PETE
You could be a little more sensitive.
He’s being serious, you could be serious
back.

DON
Uh-huh, look, this isn’t a job for
Sherlock Holmes, let me solve this major
mystery for you - if women digged ya,
18.

PETE
Forget it.

DON
Okay, never mind, that was the truth,
sorry, what was I thinking - so - I am
going to share with you this sure-fire
method I have recently developed, whereby
the biggest loser can get some. First of
all Bobby, get on TV or become a movie
star and you will get laid, I guarantee
it.

BOBBY
Tell me about it, I’d love t--

DON
Enough speaking by you. It’s listening
time. Give someone else a chance. Now,
I haven’t tried it, but I'd bet anything
this works - what do all women want to be
these days?

BOBBY
I don’t know.

DON
Lesbians.

PETE
Oh, Jesus.

DON

Hear me out, Mr. Lift-Your-Leg-On-
Everything. Women today all want to be
lesbians. Let’s not even bring Freud
into this. It is very in vogue to be a
lesbian. And we all know that there’s
nothing women like more than being in
vogue. Read a magazine - fuck, look at
the cover - it’s chic. Daily, I have
women admitting to me that they’re
intrigued by the idea. Not that they
want to give up men, cut their hair short
and start spitting on the street, but
that they’re open and very intrigued by
having a lesbian experience. So I got to
thinking, why is this? And I realized
that there’s nothing that happens to a
woman during lesbian sex that wouldn’t
happen to her with a man. In fact, less
would happen during the lesbian
experience, but nothing new that they
haven't experienced before - strictly
19.

speaking from a receiving perspective.
Are you following this, Bob?

BOBBY
Go on.

DON
You can give women that lesbian
experience they are so craving.

PETE
What are you talking about?! Let me
guess, you want him to dress up like a
woma——

DON
Not at all and keep that leg on the
ground, baby. You got a woman, she’d
like to try a lesbian experience, but
she’s a little nervous, unsure, who would
she have it with, where do you go to get
one. Women are talking about this shit,
no pulling teeth involved. So you
explain to her that if she’s not quite
sure, but flirting with it, nervous, et
cetera, you can show her exactly what
it’s like to have a lesbian experience
without her actually having a lesbian
experience. Imagine how attractive this
would be to women. What’s got to be the
number-one reason why women don’t have a
lesbian experience? Because if they do,
they have had a lesbian experience. You
can pound a billion nails and no one’1l
call you a carpenter, but you suck one
dick...

Pete begins to appreciate Don’s wit. Bobby is riveted.

BOBBY
So you just tell them that you could show
them what it’s like to be with another
woman?

DON
Exactly, parrot - once you get her home,
you explain that lesbians, just like
heterosexuals, start out with a little
kissing, so you make out. You explain
that lesbians love breasts - you play
with hers. Then you explain that in
order for her to truly understand what
it’s like to be with a woman, it’s
important that you show her some of the
things she won’t be doing during her
20.

dick and have her blow you - and you
state, “Don’t be looking for this during
your lesbian experience, this you
definitely will not be doing during an
actual lesbian experience.” Then you use
your fingers some, big with lesbians.
“Expect a lot of this”, you tell her,
“This is very popular” - you go down on
her. “Now”, you tell her, “if the
following occurs during an alleged actual
lesbian experience, then you know for
sure that you are not having a true
lesbian experience” - and you fuck her.

BOBBY
Very,very provocative, Don, man. This
really yours, man? You developed this?

DON
Now it’s yours. Use it. Soar with it.

EXT. DON & PETE’S JACUZZI - NIGHT
Don & Pete are in the jacuzzi.

DON
I hate these things. They make me itch.
Why are these things held in such high
regard around here?

PETE
If you hate it, why are you doing it?

DON
I’m trying to belong Pete! I feel like I
don’t belong. I’m trying to fit in,
“when in Rome...” - oh I’m too well
raised to be here.

PETE
Don, we need to get married.

The jacuzzi is slightly raised, so Don may conceal some things on
his side of the jacuzzi. When Pete isn’t looking, Don keeps an
eye on him, reaches out and comes up with an onion, which he
quickly tosses into the jacuzzi without Pete seeing.

DON
Okay.

PETE
I’m serious, it’s time.
21.

DON
I hear you. I’m in a jacuzzi with a guy
and he’s just proposed - exactly what I
deserve.

Again keeping an watchful eye, Don reaches out quickly tosses
some carrots into the jacuzzi without Pete seeing.

PETE
Running into Bobby today has made me
realize...

DON

What? That you have a lot to be thankful
for? That’s the worst thing about living
in L.A., the people make you feel too
damn good about yourself.

PETE
Do you know, we’re literally the only two
from home who aren’t married?

Again, etc., etc., Don quickly tosses in another onion.

DON
Uh-huh, then let’s get married.

As Pete spouts, Don reaches out, quickly dumps in a box of
noodles, then conceals the box. Soon, some celery.

PETE

We have to at least make it a
possibility, go out with women, women
that at least some guy some where would
consider appropriate. We have to make a
concerted effort to find nice girls and
Marry them. That’s what we were raised
to do, it’s what we should do.

DON
Settled. We’re getting married.
Tomorrow we set out to find wives. I’m

going to call my mother first thing, this
will please her.

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - MORNING

The house is a pretty nice house in the hills. They’re not the
kind of guys to put much into decor, they make a living, they
moved to L.A., they’re single, they have a place in the hills.

Of course, they each have their own bedroom and phone line, so in
the living room are two telephones. Don and Pete are in the
living room. Don’s on his phone talking to his mother. Pete’s
22.

DON
«+. Hiya, Ma, big news - Pete and I are
getting married ... Oh, that’s excellent

ma, you're a riot, I don’t know why
everyone says you’re so dull - no, not to
each other ... We’ve decided to find
babes to marry and -- marry ‘em...

PETE
... Yeah, I feel really good about the
decision, Mom ... No, I haven’t met any
nice girls yet, but now I’m going to make
a concerted effort ... Well, what you
hear is maybe true, maybe not, but I
figure fifty percent of this town is
transplanted from somewhere else, so ...

DON
.-. Nah, it’s not gonna be a problem for
me, but poor Pete with his drug problem -—
women here just aren’t looking for guys
with drug problems anymo-- ... You didn’t
know Pete had a drug problem? ... Oh,
yeah - big one ... It’s what happens, you
were right, everyone does drugs here ...
Right, I’m the one exception ... Yup -—
drugs ... It kills me too, he’s my best
friend. I’ve tried to help him, Ma -
he’s hooked, man ... Yeah, I’1ll hold ...

Don waits as he knows exactly what his mother’s doing.

PETE
.-. No, Mom, I wouldn’t say there’s a
waiting line ... Well, you’re a little

biased, and some of the girls here don’t
exactly share your exact value system ...
Yeah, I’ll hold...

(to Don)
I’m holding.
DON
(to Pete, fighting smiling)
Me, too.
PETE
Mom's very excited by the news.
DON
Yeah, news has a way of doing that - I’m

on.
(into phone)
«+. Oh, hiya Ma...
23.

PETE

(into phone)
.-. Yeah, I’m here, Mom ... What?! ... No-
- ... Mo-- ... Not at all-- ... She said
wha-- ... Mom, no, it was Don being funny-
- ... You know Do-- ... He told his
mother, so she’d call yo-- ... Mom, I
don’t do drugs-- ... Mom-- ...

EXT. MELROSE - DAY
Random SHOTS of the amazing people on Melrose.

ED (0.S.)
«+. Don, it’s not nothing! It’s
something! Enough of something that that
detective came to each of us to ask
questions!

AL (0.S.)
About you! She wasn’t interested in much
other than you, Don!

DON (0.S.)
It’s a scent I give off.

PETE (0.S.)
He won't deal with this! He’s just
ignoring it or pretending it--

DON (0.S.)
Hey, it’s a beautiful Friday afternoon,
you guys have left your desks early, we
can pay our bills, why doesn’t everyone
try to go fuck themselves.

ED (0.S.)
Don, listen to me, you hav--

DON (0.S.)
Ed, I don’t think you’re trying.

AL (0.S.)
She got a little angry at me. For a long
time I thought you sent her over as a
practical joke.

DON (0.S.)
Yeah, very strange wanting to fuck
someone who’s trying to send you to
prison - a first for me.
24.

PETE (0.S.)
DON, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING??!! Why
are you so comfortable being so caviler
about this??!!

DON (0.S.)
We're in L.A.! Behave laid-back,
please!...

We CUT TO the guys sitting at a Melrose OUTDOOR CAFE, where the
conversation has been coming from and CONTINUES. Al is ona
call, he has his cell phone to his ear.

DON (cont’d)
(re Melrose)
«+. The hell with me, boy is this
depressing. I bet we catch a disease.
(to Pete)
Seriously, your in L.A. now, I want you
telling nothing but lies and speaking in
improper sentences that begin and end
with “dude”.
(to Ed)
You just continue being lovely and pure.
(to Al)
Are you trying for the brain tumor?

INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ed and his wonderful wife, SUE, are at their door about to leave
for the evening. Ed is trying to get Sue out the door. Don is
baby-sitting LILY, their beautiful five year old daughter. Don
and Lily stand in the living room, posing hand-in-hand,
continuously waving, as they see Ed and Sue off.

SUE
«+. Remember - the numbers are on the
refrigerator...

DON
Right, there are no numbers, should an
emergency arise, I’ll hope for the
best...

DON & LILY
Bye.
ED
Honey, we’re really going to be late--

SUE
«+. We’re eating at Patina--
25.

DON
Oh, I love the Ivy, they have the best
Cajun rib at the Ivy...

DON & LILY
Bye.

SUE
No--

ED

Honey, if you don’t talk to him, we'll
have a better time, the key is not to
talk to hi--

DON & LILY
Bye.

INT. LILY'S BEDROOM - LATER

Don is tucking Lily in, then lays on top of the bed with her. She
adores him.

DON
Tell me a story, will ya?

LILY
There was this funny guy with a scruffy
face who was really nice that this girl
loved very much, so the guy waited till
the girl was older, because he said she
had to be and then they got married and
lived happily ever after. The end.

DON
Is the girl really rich and hardly ever
talks???
Lily slaps Don.
LILY
You tell one please.
DON
Okay. This story is called “Sara and Her
New Breasts”. There once was a girl

named Sara who was older than you, you
know, like Mommy, old enough to have
breasts, and guys didn’t pay enough
attention to her and that bothered her,
so she went out and bought some breasts
and had the doctor install them. Well,
the thing was that Sara was really smart
and wonderful, much more smart and
26.

paying attention to who already had big
ti-- um, large breasts, she just didn’t
realize it yet, but before long she grew
up and realized it and realized that
those guys whose attention she wanted
were idiots and she had to spend the rest
of her life embarrassed that she gave a
damn. The end.

LILY

I like my story better.
DON

Me too.
LILY

You're a little crazy. But I love you.

DON
Now you see, if you were older, I’d have
to respond insincerely with a, “Heyyy, I
love you too, baby”.

Doubtful she knows why, but she slaps him again.

DON (cont’d)
But you get a sincere I love you.

He gives her a kiss.
INT. ED’S HOUSE - LATER

Ed and Sue are back and see Don to the door. Sue adores Don
also.

DON
«+. It was my pleasure. I wish I did it
more often.

ED
It’s very nice of you.

DON
I’m in the entertainment business, life
is an endless pursuit to feel
occasionally clean.

SUE
She adores you.

ED
I’m not happy about it, but you may
actually have to marry her.

DON
27.

ED
Five.

DON
(thinks, then)
Oh, that’s too young.

SUE
Are you worried about this police thing?

DON
No, your stupid husband and his stupid
friends are.

SUE
You sure? Don, I’m just going to say
this... um, it would be a good idea...
just to be safe and wise - even though
there’s nothing to worry about... you
should have a lawyer.

Don hears her. As he’s halfway out the door, Sue remembers:

SUE (cont'd)
Oh, is there any damage control I need to
take care of?

DON
Oh yeah, “Sara and Her New Breasts” - a
terrific girl gets fake breasts so boys
will like her, then soon realizes what an
idiot she was to do that and spends the
rest of her life feeling like an asshole -
blah-blah-blah.

SUE
Okay, I’1l get right on that.

She kisses him goodbye. Obviously, this is something Ed and Sue
have come to expect and adjust to.

EXT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Straight out of bed, still mostly asleep, rubbing his eyes with
one hand, the other in his boxer shorts, Don walks out his front
door. He bends down and picks up the paper, dismantles it,
glancing at the front pages of the various sections. He freezes
on the Metro section, captivated by a piece of news. Hand goes
back down his pants and he reads.

INSERT - METRO SECTION

On the cover is a picture of Don with a headline that reads: “TV
Funny Guy Questioned in Jessica Black Rape and Murder”.
28.

BACK TO SCENE

Don looks up from the paper, he’s stone faced, even when he sees
what he sees when he looks up.

DON’S POV - THE PRESS

Many members of the world’s press and all their stuff are in
front of Don’s house. They’re busy setting up, waking up,
drinking coffee, etc. We’re on a quiet street and Don has made
no noise, so none of them notice Don is there.

BACK TO SCENE

Fixed blank expression, Don continues to stand there in his
shorts with his hand down his pants. He casually turns and goes
back inside.

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE

Don walks in with unchanged expression, then Pete emerges from
his bedroom, having just showered. He only wears a towel wrapped
around his waist. Pete walks by Don on his way to the kitchen to
make coffee, he doesn’t notice the newspaper in Don’s hand.

PETE
Morning.

DON
Morning.

PETE
Coffee?

DON
Please.

PETE

Did you get the paper?
Don hides the paper behind his back.

DON
Nope.

PETE
Well, will you get it?

DON
I don’t like to be informed.

Pete doesn’t want to deal with this, even though Don is by the
door, it's easier if Pete just gets the paper himself. He walks
to the door.
29.

PETE
It’s too early for this. I’11 get the
paper - that you’re much closer to. I’11
make the coffee, then why don’t I clean
the house?

DON
Don’t forget to pick up my dry-cleaning.

Pete opens the door and walks out. When he does, Don reaches
through the door, pulls Pete’s towel inside, yells out:

DON (cont’d)
HEY, IT’S HIM!

And slams the door. Immediately we HEAR the clamor of the press,
CAMERAS SNAPPING, etc., and Pete frantically BANGING on the door,
RINGING the bell. Don gets some coffee.

INT. CANTER’S DELICATESSEN - DAY

Don and Pete are back at Canter’s as arranged. Throughout the
scene, people point at Don and whisper. Bobby arrives, very
excited, and joins them at the table.

BOBBY

Don man, Don man, I couldn’t believe it,
they’re talking about you on the radio,
they’re talking about you on “Regis and
Kathy Lee” - they really like you, Don
man, Regis and Kathy Lee - they’re sure
you're clear, man - have you done their
show, Don man?! I’11 bet that Kathy Lee
can fuc--

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete standing arms around each others shoulders doing a
sloppy Rockettes. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
Bobby, I want you to say the word “man”
less. My name’s Don, not Don man.
Unless one’s a superhero, there’s no
reason to put the word “man” after a
name. You don’t hear me calling you
fucked-up idiot man - do you? When you
become a superhero, I’1ll tack the “man”
on.

BOBBY
Hey, Don ma-- you pissed off at me, Don?

PETE
Bobby, Don’s understandably upset, why
30.

DON
Anyway, aren’t we here for a reason?
Give us the good news.

BOBBY
It didn’t work.

DON
What do you mean??! You must’ve done
something wrong!

BOBBY

I did exactly what you told me! At one
party I must have tried it fifty, sixty
times, practically walked around going,
“Who wants a lesbian experience?” You
were definitely right, they’re all really
into the lesbian thing, but when I
proposed what you told me, nobody went
for it. One girl even said, “If I could
pretend you were a woman, I could pretend
you were a guy I want to fuck”.

(takes an obvious pause)

I’ve been thinking... you know... I’ve
heard about these... I think if I... I’m
thinking about getting a penis
enlargement.

PETE
WHAT??!!

With a hand, Don tries to calm Pete so he can roll with this.

DON
Interesting, interesting idea, ye--

PETE
Oh, no, this is too much! Let’s not even
fuck around about this!

DON
Would you stop talking so much? May I
talk for a change? You know damn well
that the dick is to women what the
breasts are to men - actually, I only get
a hankering for really big breasts
occasionally, but all women crave really
big dick all the time.

PETE
That’s not true!

BOBBY
Some women say it doesn’t matter.
31.

DON
They're lying - or those are women that
haven't had big dick, or women that want
to be kind to you.

PETE
I think you’re wrong.

DON

Don’t think I’m wrong, there are facts
here, things we know for sure - fact
number one, women love big dick - this
does not contradict the lesbian thing.
They're totally independent of one
another. Women’s first choice - big
dick, also popular - no dick at all...

PETE
Don--

DON
May I speak? I talk to a lot of women
and if you can get one to talk to you
honestly, she’1l tell you that when women
say it doesn’t matter, they’re lying and
the truth - that thing no one wants to
know - is that all women love big dick.
I’m sorry if that makes you
uncomfortable, it doesn’t mean a woman
can’t have a good time with you, it just
means she’1l always wish you had a bigger

dick -- in your case a much bigger dick.
BOBBY
I think he’s right, Pete.
DON
It’s a new world, my friends, “Men Are
From Mars, Women Love Penis”. And the

kind of penis they love most is big
penis. So if Bob here wants to buy
himself a big penis, we would be bad
friends to do anything but support him.
And when he’s the talk of the town, as
you know he will be, we'll be sitting at
home with our small penises in our hands,
wishing we had a penis just like Bob’s --
(to Pete)
How can you argue with me after last
night?! Tell Bobby about last night,
please.
32.

PETE
(not eagerly)
Don took me to dinner with some girls he
knows...

CUT TO:
FLASHBACK - INT. MORTON'S - NIGHT

Don and Pete are at a table with four women who are in the
entertainment industry, BETTY, VERONICA, WILMA, and OLIVIA,
attractive, animated, speak in proper English sentences, quite
well-dressed. At first WE HEAR Pete CONTINUE in VOICE OVER from
Canter’s.

PETE (V.O.)
.-. The girls seemed really nice, but
things did go like Don said they would.

We CONTINUE HEARING from where we are:
BETTY

So Pete, Don tells me you had a movie
made at Warner Brothers?

PETE

Yeah.
BETTY

Who’s your executive over there?
PETE

Fred Davis.
BETTY

(to Wilma)

Oh, I hear he has a really big cock,
Jocelyn blew him in the parking lot after
the “Batman Four” screening.

Pete thinks he’s hearing things. Even though he’s been warned,
he is absolutely aghast, winces each time the word “cock” is
said. Don just sits in silence listening attentively and
delighting.

VERONICA
He’s good friends with Paul Foggini, who
has a really big cock.

OLIVIA
You know who I hear has a really, really
big cock? Alan Dessy.
33.

WILMA
You're kidding? I would’ve never guessed
it. You know how with some guys you can
just tell?

All the girls AD LIB agreement.

VERONICA
Speaking of guys with huuuuge cocks who
you wouldn’t expect to have a huuuuge
cock, you know who has a huuuuge cock?
Jack Hartog.

BETTY, WILMA & OLIVIA
Oh sure, everyone knows that.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

It's a typical doctor's office. Behind a partition sits a very
attractive NURSE. The waiting room is packed with only men.
Amongst them, Don and Pete. Pete’s uncomfortable and
disapproving, Don’s fascinated and soon feels the need to address
all waiting.

DON
We're waiting for a friend. We’re not
here to see the doctor.

Pete squeezes Don to shut up. Don is taken with the NURSE, after
some staring, he walks over and discreetly speaks to her.

DON (cont’d)
Um, this is very embarrassing...

NURSE
It's alright sir. Everyone’s here for
the same reason, no need to be
embarrassed.

DON
Um, actually, um -- I was wondering if
the doctor does penis reductions?

INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

Bobby, Don and Pete are in the elevator coming from the doctor's
office. Others are in there, too (no children or old ladies).

DON
So, what did the doctor say about your
penis?

Pete, very familiar with Don, is unsurprised by this behavior,
more burdened. Bobby, on the other hand, would like to die and
BOBBY
Nothing.

DON
Can he make it bigger?

BOBBY
What are you talking about?

DON
You went to a penis enlargement doctor to
get a bigger penis - are you going for
it? Have they found a donor yet? Do you
get to see the penis before they attach
it? Do they bring in a bunch and you
choose the one you want? Or do you
describe the kind you’re after? Will you
be gay now, since you'll be touching
another man’s penis - oh, I meant to
recommend you ask the doctor his rate of
success and find out what exactly is an
unsuccessful penis enlargement.

Bobby has been getting increasingly bug-eyed. Next to Don is aa
pretty, young woman, AMY, (20-35) with pen and autograph book.

AMY
Excuse me, I hope this isn’t a bother,
but could I have your autograph, please?

DON
Oh, sure. Be my pleasure. You really
watch the show or are you being polite?

AMY
What?? I watch all the ti--

DON
Kidding. A little free acting and comedy
for you, don’t even have to tune in.
What’s your name?

AMY
Amy.

Don signs and hands back the book.

INT. PARAMOUNT SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

We’re on the set of “Life’s A Gas”, the TV sitcom that Don is a
regular on as the character “Floyd Lloyd”. The set is your basic
interior suburban house. Don is rehearsing, with cast, crew and

DIRECTOR, when a PA comes up discreetly and uncomfortably.
35.

PA
Don, um, excuse me, but there’s a police
detective here who wants to talk to you,
she asked me to let you know.

Don looks, sees Dreyfus and is moved to make the following
announcement to all.

DON
Hey everybody, the police is here to
question me some more about Jessica
Black. Yea! Visits from the police at
my place of work. Now you’ll have even
more to whisper about behind my back.
Hey, wanna meet her? Fellow stars, crew,
Mr. Director, wanna meet the policewoman
who has implicated me in the rape and
strangulation of Jessica Black - and
won't stop? She’s really nice -
especially the parts of her that aren’t
real.

The Director steps up to Don.

DIRECTOR
Don, why don’t you do what you have to
do, we'll take a break.

Displeased, Don walks over to Dreyfus.

DON
Let’s go to my trailer.

INT. DON’S TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

DON
.-. Look, I’m sorry. I know I’m not
especially easy going, but I’ve never
been confronted by authority with fake
breasts before. Now I answered your God-
damn questions. You didn’t have to talk
to the press - I got a mothe--

DREYFUS
I don’t hate you enough yet, I said
nothing to the press! The press doesn’t
need me for information.

DON
Oh -- you didn’t tell the press?

DREYFUS
No, it just so happens I did not.
36.

DON

Oh -- good -- so, you're really a cop?
DREYFUS

Yes.
DON

I really don’t mean to be rude, but,
what, none of the strip clubs were
hiring?

DREYFUS
Not only don’t you mean to be rude, you
mean to be charming. That’s you trying
to be charming - right?

DON
Uh-huh?

DREYFUS
That’s fascinating. Actors really are as
fucked up as they say.

DON
Yeah, you need ten to fifteen of us to
have one whole human being.

DREYFUS
I’ve seen your show. You don’t write it,
do you?
DON
No. It’s not my favorite show.
DREYFUS
Oh, good.
DON
So, you go out on a date, you have a gun
with you?
DREYFUS
Yes.
DON
Do guys have a problem with your being a
cop?
DREYFUS
Yes.
DON

I wouldn't. I like the idea. If we were
out and had a run-in with some guy, I'd
37.

and - what’s more - if you were having
trouble with him, rather than bothering
me - use the gun.

DREYFUS
I see. Well, wow, a whole human might
only take five to ten of you. Um,
anyway, I’m here because now you have to
answer some more questions, because there
have been developments, you’re now
officially a suspect in the Jessica Black
rape and murder case.

DON
Dinner tonight?

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete, Al and Ed sit around the living room. Al pulls his phone
away from his mouth to say:

AL
.-. I don’t understand, why won’t he come
out of his room?? How long has he been
in there??

PETE
Al, relax. He came home this afternoon
with a dog, told me to leave him alone,
went into his room with the dog, that’s

all I know -- that detective showed up on
the set today -- people are pointing and
whispering.

ED

It’s one thing after another lately.
First I learn there are vagina-rings, now
Don’s a suspect. I didn’t think anything
could be more terrible than those rings.
This is so awful - especially for him -
are you sure he’s alright?

 

AL
Okay, someone’s got to say it, I know he
didn't do it, but -- do you think it’s

possible he could’ve done it?
WE HEAR a door open within the house.

DON (0.S.)
Come on, boy.

A MUTT scurries in, sniffs and licks everybody. Don walks in,
doesn’t even say hello.
38.

ED

What a handsome dog!
PETE

Yeah, seems real sweet, too.
AL

Does he do any tricks?
DON

Yup. Just taught him one.
AL

(to dog)
Sit -- sit boy -- siiii -- siiiiit.

The dog does nothing. Pete, Ed and Al try to get him to do
something. They AD LIB, “roll over”, “speak”, “give me five”,
etc. The dog does nothing.

PETE
Good job, Don. I think you’re ready for
lions.

Don takes his finger and swipes or taps his nose with it - the
gesture from “The Sting” will do. When he does that, the dog
says:

MUTT
Asshole.

Yes, the dog actually speaks - they can, you know. It’s
certainly guttural sounding, not quite as clear as when you and I
say it, but it is “asshole”.

Pete, Ed and Al can’t believe their ears. Frantically they start
shouting:

PETE, ED & AL
Did he just say asshole?!/Did you make
that dog talk?!/I think he said
asshole!/Can he do it again?!

Don does the gesture.

MUTT
Asshole.

Wildly, Pete, Ed and Al do the gesture over and over, but the
Mutt doesn’t react. The guys look to Don. Don does the gesture.

MUTT (cont'd)
Asshole.
39.

PETE, ED & AL
That’s unbelievable!/How’d you do it?!/A
talking dog!/I don’t believe it!

AL

Does he say anything else?
DON

Nope.
PETE

Well, let’s teach him some more.
(right to mutt)
Say - Pete -- Pete -- Peeeete.

Don does the gesture.

MUTT
(right to Pete)

Asshole.

DON
Nah, perfect.

ED
He’s cute.

PETE

Maybe he'll help me find a nice girl.

ED
You guys aren’t having any success
finding wives?

PETE
That’s right. Of course only one of us
is really interested in a wife, the other
of us just likes humoring the one of us
that is really interested in a wife.

DON
I'd really like a wife.

AL
No, you wouldn't.

DON
Of course I would. You think the idea of
someone wonderful in my life repulses me?
Hey! Don’t be so presumptuous, wise guy.
You have to meet a wonderful person, but
really meet a wonderful person - not meet
a person!
40.

MUTT

Asshole.

Don makes it plural by adding the “s”.

INT. DON’S

BEDROOM - DAY

Don’s bedroom is fantastically messy. He lays in bed with Mutt
by his side and the phone to his ear.

DON
«+. You kidding? I’d like just to find a
girl who didn’t love getting spanked...
Yeah, anyway, Ma, big news ... No, no,
besides the Jessica Black thing - I told
you, they just talked to me just because
I was there, and the press got hold of
it, made some fuss - forget all about
that, it’s nothing. But listen, got a
dog ... Yeah, you want to say hello? ...

Don holds up the phone to Mutt.

Don does t

MA (V.O.)
(old saccharine)
... Hellooooo sweetheart, are you a good
boy? I know you are, yes you are, you’re
a good boy--

he gesture.

MUTT
Asshole.

MA (V.O.)
.-. Don! ... Is there someone else on the
line?! ... Hello! ... Hello, Don! ... Did

you hear someone say--

Don gets back on the line.

DING DONG.

DON
.+. Hey Ma ... No, I didn’t hear anything
... Beats me ... Yeah, okay, I’11 call
the phone company ... His name? ... I
named him after you actually ... Heyyy,
you're my mother ...

The doorbell rings. Mutt runs to the door BARKING.

DON (cont’d)
(yells to Mutt)
Hey, Life-Ruiner - shut up!
(into phone)
(yells to Mutt)
Life-Ruiner - come!

(into phone)
«.. talk to you - bye.

FRONT DOOR
Don answers it, it’s Dreyfus and two uniformed policemen.
DON
Heyyyy, Detective Little Annie Fanny. I

wish you had called, I don’t really look
my best.

4l.

Don winks at her. They come right in. Dreyfus presents Don with

a paper.

DREYFUS
Donald Miller, I have a search warrant to
search the premises.

DON
“A search war...” Doctor! Doctor! I do
not want to play cops and robbers with
you!! Stop this already!!!

DREYFUS
I’m sorry! I am! I have my job to do.
I have a search warrant.

Don immediately does the gesture repeatedly.

MUTT
Asshole. Asshole. Asshole. Asshole.

As Mutt says “asshole” repeatedly, Dreyfus instructs the

policemen to search, directing them towards Don’s bedroom.

her curiosity becomes aroused by the dog.

DREYFUS
Can that dog talk?

DON
When inspired.

She walks towards Don’s bedroom. Don follows.

DON (cont’d)
They better not mess up my room.

DON’S BEDROOM

Then

One Policeman is in the closet, one in the bathroom. Don and

Dreyfus come walking in.
42.

DON
Look what they’ve done! Okay, now you
can clean it up.

Policeman #1 calls over Dreyfus, discreetly shows her what he
found on the floor of Don’s closet. It’s Don’s tuxedo and in the
coat pocket, slightly hanging out, a frilly pair of panties.
Dreyfus turns to Don with the panties dangling from a pen.

DREYFUS
What’s this?

DON
The universal symbol for “I surrender,
now fuck me” - let’s form a line, fellas.

Dreyfus plastic-bags the underwear.

DREYFUS
Take the tux.

Policeman #1 gathers Don’s formal clothes. As they go:

DREYFUS (cont'd)
Don’t leave town.

DON

On top of everything else, must you speak
in cliches?

(calling after them)
I want those panties back! Haven’t you
ever seen underwear before? Hey, you
forgot to clean up! What do you say we
go Italian tonight?

EXT. MULHOLLAND DOG PARK —- DAY

A scene, with dogs. People are supposed to come here for their
dogs, but you have to wonder. There are famous people, people
who wish they were famous, lots of young Hollywood, plenty of
beauties and hip folk, etc.

Don is there with Mutt, as is Pete, Al, on his phone, and BETH,
Al's shapely, noticeable-looking wife - and yup, Don's right,
those are definitely not her original breasts. People point,
stare and whisper about Don. He does a convincing job of
pretending it’s not happening.

Mutt is off frolicking with other dogs as our gang socializes
amongst themselves. Beth confronts Don. Don and Beth’s
relationship is combative, strained, etc.

BETH
Hello, Don.
43.

DON

Beth - you're looking hot, as always.
BETH

Thank you.
DON

That wasn’t a compliment actually.
Sexiest thing in the world is a babe with
a bod that doesn’t feel the need to show
it off.

BETH
Rape and murder anyone today, Don? Why
don’t you mind your own business?

DON
Unfortunately, ever since I found you in
the bathroom at that restaurant in New
York, giving Al’s boss at the time a blow
job, it’s been rather hard for me to mind
my own business where you’re concerned.
You see, I’ve never been quite convinced
that I did the right thing by not telling
Al, but you assured me no such thing
would ever happen again and my dear
friend is foolishly in love with you, so
I just worry about it quietly, but would
worry less if you’d dress more elegantly
and tell your husband that your tits are
fake.

BETH
(changing the subject)
I hear your show is doing very well.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete each with big smiles on their face as they leap, one at
a time, like Baryshnikov. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON

Yeah, doing well.
BETH

(re: dogs)

So which one’s yours?

DON
That one.

BETH
Oh, it’s cute. What’s its name?

DON
44,

BETH
Really? I’m flattered. Let’s meet him.

DON
(shouting out)
Here, Fake-Tits. Fake-Tits, come.

Beth storms off, grabs Al to leave. Pete brings an idiot he and
Don know over to see Don - JOE, young, unbelievably young to be
behaving like this, does exist, stereotype (18-24) - Dawson would
be good. Ed, Sue and Lily have arrived in the b.g.

PETE
Hey, Don, look who’s here.

DON
Hey, Joe, whaddya know?

JOE
What do I know, you’re the most famous
man in Hollywood, great to see you, Don -
love the show, love it - congratulations -
I smell an Emmy.

DON
I’m pretty sure that’s dog shit, Joe, I
haven't been a dog owner that long, but
my olfactories are pretty good, and
there’s a lot of it around -- and stop
talking so much.

JOE
This guy has got to be the funniest guy
in the world - funny and famous, hell of
a combo.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete, one at a time, smiling broadly while shuffling off to
buffalo past the camera. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
Are you a producer now, Joe? And stop
talking so much.

JOE
Yeah, I’m a producer, you heard?

DON
I could smell it - What are you
producing? In very few words.

JOE
I have several projects. I got some
scripts at Fox, developing some shows
45.

teeing up lots of meetings, was talking
to Pete, “Mr. Big Spec Sale” here - love
to set up one of his babies.

DON
Let me teach you a word, Joe. Good word.
Gonna come in very handy for you -

“nothing”. Producer? Last time I saw
you, you had trouble producing me a drink
at a bar.

JOE

Last time you saw me I was an actor --
and writer. Here’s a thought just
happened to pop into my head - just
chatting now - the movie rights, still
available on your story?

DON
Joe, just chatting now, your head, still
available to take a shit on?

JOE
I honestly don’t think I’ve ever met
anything or one funnier than this guy.

Mutt comes over.

PETE
Hey, here’s Don’s new dog I was telling
you about.

JOE

Yeah, Pete told me you got a dog - lotta
responsibility. Hiya, fellah, atta boy,
you’re a good looking mutt, we gotta get
you a girlfriend. Why aren’t you out
there humping some bitch?

Don does the gesture.

MUTT
Asshole.
JOE
Did this dog just say something?
DON
Huh, Joe?
JOE

It sounded like the dog said something.

PETE
Dogs don’t talk, Joe.
46.

Don does the gesture.

MUTT
Asshole.

JOE
There! He just did it again! He’s
saying “asshole”!

PETE
I don’t think so, Joe.

DON
I spend a lot of time with this dog, Joe -
some barking, a little whining...

JESSICA
I’m telling you this dog is saying
“asshole”!
(wants Mutt’s attention)
Hey dog, dog, over here, here...

Don does the gesture.

MUTT
Asshole.

JOE
You guys didn’t hear that?! This dog is
saying “asshole” to me!

DON
Look Joe, if this dog would say asshole
to anybody, it’d be you, but he just met

y--
JOE

I’m tellin’ya -- Jesus -- alright --

whatever -- what’s this hound’s name?
DON

I named him after you.

JOE
You're kiddin’? How ‘bout that.

At this very moment, as if Joe were a tree, Mutt lifts his leg
and urinates on Joe’s pant-leg and shoe. Don reacts, causing Joe
to realize, just as Mutt finishes and scampers off to play.

DON
Bad, Boring-And-Stupid! Bad boy, Boring-
And-Stupid!
47.

DOG PARK - LATER
Ed and Pete talk, Lily and Mutt play, Sue and Don talk.
SUE & DON

SUE
I’m not going to ease into this. I’m
worried, I refuse to pretend I’m not. Are
you okay? I’d like an answer. Of course
you never talk about it, you nev--

DON
I’m the strong, silent type...

SUE
Wouldn’t you like to talk about i--

DON
No - that’s exactly what I wouldn’t like
to do. Thank you - don’t worry. This is
a dopey thing and I have enough dopey
things in my life. It’s nothing, it’s
going to go away.

SUE
(pause)
How’s finding a wife going?

DON
Pretty good. I haven’t found anyone to
marry, but many I’d like to divorce.

She can enjoy Don’s sense of humor.

SUE
Don’t you feel worthy?

DON
Is this ask-really-annoying-questions
day, as opposed to all other days where
women only celebrate ask-annoying-
questions day?

SUE
This attitude may make it a little hard
to find a wife. You’re going to answer
one of my questions today, you can pick
which one.

DON
Worthy. I’m a member of the
entertainment community, I cannot deny I
find myself strangely comfortable here
48.

SUE
This attitude may make it a little hard
to find a wife. Do you really want a
wife?

DON
I really like the idea of a wife. I'd
really like a life - I find more
acceptable -- I tell you things I don’t
tell other people, for some reason -- I
think it would be nifty to have a girl in
my life who I do that with and also sleep

with.

SUE
What does that mean, a more acceptable
life?

DON

I would like to feel proud of what I do -
proud of myself in general - I always
thought I would.

SUE
There are perhaps better ways of spending
a day than teaching your dog to say
“asshole”.

DON
I know -- it kills the time.

SUE
Though it is rather impressive.

DON
I'd’ve married you if I found you first.

SUE
No, you wouldn’t have. That’s very sweet
of you to say, though.
Lily runs up.

LILY
Don, what’s your doggie’s name?

DON
I named him after you, actually.

Don heaves a stick.

DON (cont’d)
Fetch, Reason-To-Live.
49,

INT. PETE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Pete’s bedroom is not messy like Don’s. Pete is fast asleep, as
Don nonchalantly opens the door, pokes his head in and says:

DON
Get up, time to save Bobby’s penis.

CUT TO:
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Don, really pissed-off, holds Bobby’s shirt and shoes, and

smacks Bobby’s head and shoves him along, as Bobby tries to put
on his pants under the hospital gown he’s wearing. Pete tries to
calm himself.

DON
«+. YOU RESCHEDULED AN HOUR EARLIER??!!
BECAUSE OF A COMMERCIAL AUDITION???!11!

BOBBY
A national - “Tostitos”.

DON

Shut up - and you didn’t tell us????!1!!
Our plan was to get here before you did
and go “only kidding” when you walked in!
You were two seconds away from having
your penis cut up for a snack!! I just
pulled you off a table where some guy had
your dick in one hand and a scalpel in

 

the other!!! The problem isn’t your
penis, it’s your asshole - it’s become
all of you!

BOBBY

Don, I’m suffering from low self-esteem,
a bigger dick would--

DON
Shut up, you’re suffering from low
intelligence! If you can say you have
low self-esteem - you don’t have it!
Anything someone says they are or have -—
they’re not and don’t - the last and only
fact!

BOBBY
Don, you yourself know that women lik--

DON
How ‘bout I get to speak a little? Let
me tell you something, if you have any
50.

you have left is to play the cards you’re
dealt. Men play the cards they’re dealt
and take them like a man when there were
men.

PETE
Bobby, did you really want to spend the
rest of your life knowing you had
elective plastic surgery on your penis?
Don’t you want the thrill of a woman
falling in love with you for you? Not
because of lies you’ve told her, or how
much money you have or because you've
gotten hair, chest, cheek, calf or penile
implants, but because of you, and then
you've found someone who loves you - true
love, maybe not with the perfect person -
of course not, but at least true love...

DON
Thank you very much Hallmark, let me tell
you something, did you see “Planet Of The
Apes"? That wasn’t science fiction -
truth, baby. Prophecy. Except it’s not
gonna be planet of the apes, it’s gonna
be planet of the chicks. Women are gonna
completely take over the world, they will
enslave men, treat them like animals - on
good days, we'll do all the shit work,
they’11 cut out our brains, forbid us to
talk - you can’t blame ‘em for that - a
few of us will be used for mating
purposes just to keep the species going,
we'll have to nail disgusting, dirty,
fat, retarded women and if we don’t fuck
‘em and knock ‘em up, we will be
considered useless and talk about penis
operations, they’1l show ya a penis
operation - make your life a whole lot
easier. So I suggest you get in as much
being a man as you can while you can.
It’s coming baby - planet of the chicks.

PETE
Thank you very much, Marlin Perkins, the
point, Bobby, is that it’s probably not
your penis that’s the problem.

DON
Though I’m sure it’s not helpin’ any -
come here.

Don drags Bobby out of the shade into the light, grabs him by the
waist of his pants and yanks, then looks down into his pants and
pauses.
51.

DON (cont’d)
That’s not a boner, is it?

Bobby crumbles, Don grabs his pants, he wants more of a look.”

DON (cont’d)
-- Okay, you can have the operation.

Bobby crumbles into smaller pieces, feels about as small as his
penis. Don leads him back the way they came. Then stops and:

DON (cont’d)

Kidding. Kidding. I’m sure all is not
lost - your dick is useless, you're not
rich, yeah - you’re in some trouble
here...

(grabs his mouth, looks in)
Oh yeah, that‘1ll do - we gotta play up
your tongue. You see, that’s how it
works, God didn’t give’ya any kinda dick
to speak of, but we all get some bad and
some fine - that’s life, same for
everybody - no operations needed. So
here’s what we do - calm down, all is not
lost - we spread it around that you have
the best tongue in town - I’m tellin’ ya,
this'll get you action. A lot, I mean a
lot of women prefer it - it goes back to
the whole lesbian thing.

BOBBY
I just don’t know what to do...

DON
Right. That’s what you have in common
with everybody else. There’s someone out
there just like you - close your eyes and
point, swing a cat.

EXT. DON AND PETE’S DRIVEWAY - MORNING

Ed, Al, Don and Pete are loading up Don’s brand new Buick Skylark
with their golf clubs. Don has over-dressed the part.

AL
You finally buy a new car and you buy a
Buick Skylark?

DON
What’s wrong with this car? It gets you
there. Look at what this baby can do.

Don gets behind the wheel to show the guys things about the car.
52.

DON (cont’d)
Let’s say you’re driving along and it
starts to rain - you just hit this button
here and...

The windshield wipers come on.

DON (cont’d)
How ‘bout that? What will they think of
next - huh?

Ed, Al and Pete have known Don a long time and gave up on
stifling him long ago. Al makes a call.

DON (cont’d)
Now, let’s say you felt like taking a
drive at night - look at this...

The headlights come on.
DON (cont’d)
It’s like something James Bond would
drive.

A plain car pulls into the driveway. Ed notices with concern.

ED
Uh, guys...

DON
Oooh, look at this! Let’s say you wanted
to see behind you - easy - look at what
this baby has.

Don moves the rear view mirror around.

PETE
Hey, Don.

DON
Fuck! Yeah, I see.

Don gets out of the car to greet Detective Dreyfus, exiting the
car that’s just pulled up. She holds another paper. He’s
getting tired of this.

DREYFUS
Hello, fellas.

All AD LIB polite greetings.

DON
Hiya, doll.
53.

DREYFUS
(to Don)
Is there somewhere we could talk alone?

ED
We'll get out of your way.

DON
That’s alright. Go ahead. You can talk
in front of them. Just hurry - will ya?
We got a tee-off time. My friend Ed here
has just started his own accounting firm
and we’re celebrating with a golf outing.

DREYFUS
Have it your way. We’re gonna need a
semen sample.

DON
So go spit on a microscope--

Ed, Al, interrupting his call, and Pete immediately AD LIB, i.e.,
“Take it easy, Don”, “Sorry Detective, he’s very upset”, etc., to
try and protect Don.

DON (cont’d)
What?! I’ve had enough of this! She
keeps popping up! I have golf to play,
celebrate my buddy hanging his own
shingle! A semen sample?! What the fuck
are you talking about?!

ED
May we ask why you need him to - do that?

DREYFUS
We’ve matched a personal article found in
Mr. Miller’s possession as belonging to
the victim. We want to see if Mr.
Miller's semen matches the semen taken
from the victim.

DON
She just likes saying semen.

ED
Perhaps we should call a lawyer.
DREYFUS
You should. However, I have a court
order.
DON

Courts are now ordering me to whack off?
54.

AL
(interrupting his call)
Don, just do what they want!

DON
Okay, can I go inside and do it? It
seems to bother some of the neighbors
when I do it in the driveway.

DREYFUS
At the station.

DON
What?! We got a jar! Fortunately a
very, very, very big jar...

DREYFUS
You have to come to the sta--
DON
One of those Costco size--
DREYFUS
At the station! That’s how it’s done!
DON
Come on!! I have a tee-off time -- I
think maybe we should start seeing other

people.
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Ed, Al and Pete wait outside. Soon Don comes out zipping up his
fly. He shows no expression, doesn’t stop, just keeps on walking
past the guys towards his car. As he passes them, to them he
flips off:

DON
Okay, come on, let’s go, finished jerking
off at the police station.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete sitting in a row, side-by-side, clapping and swaying.
We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - LATER

The guys have stopped at some basic bar, with a JUKE BOX, between
L.A. and Malibu, for some post golf boozing. They look out of
place in their golf garb, as they and their drinks occupy a table
near the bar.

At the bar is a BARTENDER and four blue-collar FELLOWS: FRED,
BARNEY, ARCHIE and REGGIE. These fellows are not pretty. They
55.

don't look especially taken with the guys, either. This does not

go unnoticed by Ed, Al and Pete.

DON
Nothing like a little golf after jerking
off at the police station - if you
thought my three wood on the seventeenth
was a shot, you should’ve been there at
the station...

AL
(with a discreet sotto voce)
Why did we have to stop here? Where the
fuck are we? Let’s go. These guys are
staring.

DON
And if you get any worse at golf, Al,
you'll be playing croquet. Why should we
care about these guys? Presidents play
better than you. And what’s wrong with
this place? It’s nice to do something
non-L.A.’y for a change...

Don said that loud enough to be heard, Ed, Al and Pete are
concerned. But Don just keeps on going.

DON (cont’d)

... Al, there’s a certain amount of skill
we're all born with to play the game of
golf. God didn’t give you yours. Why do
you suppose that is?

Al makes a call.

PETE
(discreet sotto voce)
Maybe we should go, Don. These guys are
talking about you - I don’t think they’re
fans.

DON
(speaking too loudly)

These fellahs? Fuck ‘em. You know what
the difference between L.A. and New York
is? In N.Y., if you squint, you can
think you’re in an elegant place, when in
fact it’s a city of slobs costumed like
non-slobs. L.A., it’s like the circus
never leaves town. You’re allowed to be
an asshole here--

FRED
Hey. Hey you, with the mouth.
56.

ED
(under his breath)
He’s talking to you Don, let us handle
this, okay?
(to Fred)
Hi, how ya doin’?

FRED
I wasn’t talking to you. I was talking
to the guy on TV. You’re on TV, aren’t
you?

DON
Yup.

BARNEY
You're that Floyd guy -right?

DON
Right. Floyd Lloyd.

All four fellows laugh, AD LIB wisecracks, i.e., “Floyd - Lloyd
right”, “What a stupid name”, etc.

FRED
We've been listening to you talk for what
seems like an hour now - “New York this,
L.A. is full of assholes”. You like to
talk, don’t you?

DON
Yes I do. I like to talk.

ARCHIE
Why do you like to talk so much, Floyd
Lloyd?

DON

Oh, afraid others might otherwise.

REGGIE
You’re not doing much talking at the
moment, Floyd.

DON
Be patient.

BARNEY
Since you’re on television and all, you
probably figure what you have to say is
more valuable than what we have to say,
for instance.

DON
57.

PETE
(stands)
Look, guys, this is looking like it may
be heading somewhere bad, can we just--

Archie stands and approaches Pete.

The

The

Don
the

ARCHIE
You’re very rude for someone who has the
time to play golf in the middle of the
week, we were talking to Floyd. Don’t be
rude to us.

DON
Yeah, don’t be rude to them, Pete.
(to fellows, re: Pete)
He needs to be taught a lesson.

AL
Don, please.

FRED
Yeah, please, Floyd.

fellows repeatedly say “Please, Floyd” in funny voices.

DON
Fellas -- FELLAS...

fellows stop.

DON (cont’d)
I’m trying to chat with my friends here.

turns away and talks to the guys more than loud enough for
fellows to hear.

DON (cont’d)
So, as I was saying, one thing both
places have, L.A. and New York - pathetic
losers sitting at bar--

REGGIE
Hey, Floyd! You ain’t gonna get great
ratings on television with a bashed-in
face.

DON
That was very impressive the way you
tailored that threat to the person you
were threatening, using jargon inherent
to his field, which obviously intimidates
you - of course, you used it improperly -
I don’t get ratings, the show does.
58.

ARCHIE
Nothing about you is intimidating, TV
star.

FRED

You make a lot of money dressing up,
making little funny remarks, putting in
what - a twenty hour week?

DON
That’s a hard week.
(stands)
It bothers you that I’m on television.

Barney goes to stand and speak, Don interrupts him from doing
both.

DON (cont’d)
I’m talking now, get comfortable, this
won't be brief. You resent that I’m on
TV. I get it, I resent it a little
myself. And the money, the money is good
- by your guys’ standards great - fucking
unbelievably great - and I’m not sure
you'd call what I do to get it - work. I
certainly never break a sweat, never put
any back into it. In all fairness, it
can be unbelievably boring, I mean I nap
every day. I’m paid huge amounts of
money, by your guys’ standards, to nap in
my cushy trailer - gotta love it, huh?
Only in America. And when I’m not
napping, I’m eating - all this great food
that’s just there for the taking all the
time - I mean all the food you want and
the best God-damn stuff. And when I’m
not napping or eating - I’m fucking,
fucking these gorgeous women. Everything
you hear is true. If you’re on
television you get laid - laid - and laid
some more by the most unbelievably
magnificent women - MTV stuff - and you
don’t have to talk to ‘em or buy ‘em
dinner, they’1l just fuck ya - yup,
they’1l just fuck you here, there,
everywhere, anywhere - fuck ya in the
morning, fuck ya in the evening, fuck ya
round supper time - doesn’t that sound
like a great life? Floyd Lloyd - on
television every week - I went to
Julliard, I ate rice and ketchup and
slept in the park when I didn’t have to,
because I really do believe, don’t laugh,
one must suffer for his art and there is
59.

I’ve played “Hamlet” - and played it well
- importantly - I really went to the
trouble of learning what acting really
is, really loving it and really got good
at it - Floyd Lloyd - And talk about
work, that was work - your guys’ idea of
work - getting to being a good actor, a
really good actor damn near broke my
back, took all the sweat I had,
practically killed me - Floyd Lloyd...

Al must get off his call, he’s riveted to Don.

DON (cont’d)
... Affable best friend on the hit
television situation comedy, “Life’s A
Gas” - I sold out, I guess - I didn’t
mean to. My days are spent getting my
friends to enlarge their dicks, then
stopping them - I’m a grown man - Floyd
Lloyd - I played “Hamlet” importantly.
You think it’s no work to be F.L.? It’s
not a lot of things. But I wanted to
work. Like my very lovely family went to
a lot of trouble to teach me to do - like
my father does - hard work every day -
wears a suit - doesn’t matter what it
cost, lot or little, it’s a proper suit,
he’s a businessman, he’s not trying to
impress you, he’s dressing suitably and
substantially, because he’s a substantial
person and he goes to work and does his
job suitably and substantially, because
he doesn’t accept that there’s any other
way to do it and he’ll always get to do
it, because everyone knows he couldn’t do
it any other way. And my mother adores
him. He’s a man that’s achieved being
truly adored - not because he brings home
lots of bacon, but because he deserves to
be adored and my mother is of such
quality that she recognizes when
someone’s truly worthy of being adored
and so can’t help but do so...

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete tossing a football. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON (cont’d)
«+. So my dad works hard - does he like
it? I don’t know, but I can’t fathom
that he possibly could, he does it like a
man, though. Like it or not, he takes
his nine-to-five job and the job life has
given him - like a man - like a good man -
60.

he gets to be a good man, and he gets to
be truly adored - by my mother - Floyd
fucking Lloyd - I got a lot of fans - for
“dressing up, making funny little
remarks” - people actually find that a
big deal - you’re not the only ones - I
kill a day teaching my dog to say
“asshole” - and you’re sitting there
pissed at me for it? What do you guys
do? Collect garbage, dig ditches, work
in the steel mill? Whatever, less I
could not care. I assume it ain’t
glamorous - you bust your asses, don’t
make much dough - boo-hoo, sounds pretty
crumby. You’d rather be on television
maybe, get laid all the time - eat, sleep
- that’s fair, I hear you. Hard work - a
buck, something like work - a bundle.
Yes, I get laid by beautiful women all
the time, the ugliest woman I’ve ever
fucked is a thousand times more beautiful
than any woman who has ever talked to you
and thanks to “Entertainment Tonight” a
few of them even know my real name - you
think my life is better than your life?

(beat)
Okay, how could you not, but I gotta tell
you -- in truth -- in truth - that thing
that no one wants any part of -- it’s not

better enough, it’s not altogether
better, it’s better but not good -
working in the steel mill could never be
sensational, but with some care, if you
married my mother, had kids nothing like
me, held one or two interesting hobbies --
it could maybe be good.

(to Bartender)
What’s your best scotch?

BARTENDER
(mesmerized)
Uhhh, Glenlivet.

DON
I’‘1l have a double, ice, splash of water -
my friends are drinking Coronas -
(sits at bar, to fellows)
Your round.

All are transported. The fellows push their money on the bar
toward the Bartender, letting him know to do as Don said.

EXT. ORSO RESTAURANT - DAY - DON AND LOUIS

world is Louis’ tie. The second most colorful thing in the world
is Louis’ vest - it’s that look where you buy the vest separately
and add it to your suit of choice. The third most colorful thing
in the world is Louis’ pocket square. The fourth most colorful
thing in the world is surely Louis’ suspenders, but we don’t see
those. Louis has a very strange balding pattern going on.

LOUIS
«+. What about the young chick - the one
who plays the daughter - are you getting
some of that? I hope somebody is.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete hold on to each others waist and do the rumba. We SMASH
CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
Uhhhh, no-no, I don’t know, I think she’s
fourteen - nice to meet you, by the way,
can we talk about the matter at hand?
You know I didn’t do thi--

LOUIS
That’s your business.

DON
It’s my business? You’d like to know if
I've slept with the girl who plays the
daughter on “Life’s A Gas”, who's
fourteen in real life, but not if I
committed the crime I’m being
investigated for?

LOUIS
That’s your business. It’s my business
to get you off - if it comes to that.

DON
Well, thank you very much - um, you
couldn’t care less whether or not I did
it?

LOUIS
I think it would be nice if there were no
murder and rape. However, if it stops
existing, I will have made a very poor
career choice - I’m a criminal defense
attorney, it’s what I do - there is
murder and rape - plenty of it - you may
be in need of what I do - regardless of
your guilt or innocence, you may be in
need of what I do - regardless of your
guilt or innocence, the law says you’re
entitled to it.
62.

DON
I know you’re not in the comforting
busines, you’re in the “getting off”
business, but I do feel the need to tell
you, sir, that I would find some comfort
in your believing I didn’t do it.

LOUIS
Fine, that won’t cost you extra. The
time we’re wasting will, though. You
want me to think or believe you didn’t do
it? Fine, really, fine - you should stop
saying it so much, though. The rule of
thumb in this business - if your client
tells you he’s innocent, he’s not - and
call me Louis.

EXT. PARAMOUNT - DAY

Ed meets Don outside the stage. They walk the streets of the
studio.

DON
Sorry you had to wait, they actually feel
the need to rehearse this shit.

ED
That’s okay, I think studios are really
fun. I saw Frasier and Eddie Murphy.

DON
You’re so cute.

ED
Where are we eating?

As they stroll, a shiny, new Mercedes 500 SL parks and from it
emerges an extremely stunning, leggy, busty, expensively clad,
Chanel expensive, very young, too-young-for-all-this woman, (20).

DON
Pick it.

As they pass her, Don flips off the following remark to her:

DON (cont’d)
Fuckin’ somebody rich - huh?

Ed can’t believe what he heard, neither can the young woman.

ED
Do you know her??

DON
ED
Why did you say that?!

DON
Stating the obvious.

ED
(angry)
That’s not your job! Why did you feel
the need to say that?!

DON
Just came out. What is a young girl like
her driving that car and over-dressing in
that way for - didn’t she receive any
guidance from her parents? Someone needs
to say something to her. Fucking land
without rules of conduct.

Nearby, a blue-blazored tour guide shepherds a group of tourists.

Don waves and yells over.

DON (cont'd)
Hello, welcome to L.A. - the “be careful
what you wish for” city.

Ed yanks him away.

ED
What’s the matter with you?! This is the
world we live in. If you can’t handle
it, you better get some help! Come to
your friends who love you! That’s right,
there’s some bad around - and some
unattractive and -- perhaps I’m putting
it nicely. That’s why you have to make
sure to put some good and pretty things
in your life as well. If you can’t
handle it, you better get some help--

They're yelling at each other.

DON
Why don’t more people speak up?! Why
aren’t more people offended?! Why does
something have to explode or die or get
raped to get a reaction from this crowd
that inhabits the earth?! Why should I
fucking accept the unacceptable?!

ED
Because that’s what you do when you’re a
grown-up -- it’s childish to think things
are going to be correct -- as long as
64.

your family isn’t fucked with, you'd be
amazed what you can bear.

Don has had some wind taken out of his sails. Ed and Don have
reached the NEW YORK STREET on the lot. They hang out there on a
fake New York street corner.

ED (cont'd)
I don’t know, Don, I’m worried about you -
- since the murder you'v--

DON
Fuck the murder - I mean, I understand -
I have no right to complain, I understand
- I have a lot to be thankful for, but
I’m not wrong - am I - this really is a
very silly life I got going here. If you
made me up and put me in a movie, nobody
would buy me. And that’s without being
suspected of raping and murdering a mega-
star. Okay, I aspired to be an artist
and ended up Floyd Lloyd - I’m an
asshole, have no one to blame but myself.
Okay, I’m too well raised to be in this
business - it pays a good buck, shut the
fuck up, absolutely, I get that. What I
can’t bear is having a life everyone
thinks is so great, that is in fact
beneath all of us. What am I wool? My
purpose in life is to be part of the
great irony on earth that proves we're
all supreme assholes. It’s the nineties,
a fucking school teacher can’t get the
fucking time of day, but Floyd Lloyd gets
fifty grand for two hours of his time to
open a shopping mall???!

A fan, WALTER, (45), appears out of nowhere and interrupts.

WALTER
I hate to do this to you, I saw you from
the tour, I’m a big fan, could I--

DON
Sure, no problem. What’s your name?

WALTER
Walter.

Don gives Walter an autograph. They AD LIB thank you and
goodbye. Walter leaves. Don’s still where he was.

DON
You're not allowed to hit women, why
would they think I think you’re allowed
65.

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Don’s alone, his phone rings, he answers it. We HEAR the other
end of the conversation VIA CELLULAR PHONE in VOICE OVER.

DON
«+. Yeah ...

LOUIS (V.0O.)
«+. Don - Louis, quickly, I may lose you -
they’re charging you with the rape and
murder of Jessica Black...

Don closes his eyes, we JUMP into Don’s head, more rumba. We
HEAR Louis continue in VOICE OVER as we stay in Don’s head longer
than usual.

LOUIS (cont'd) (V.O.) (cont’d)
.-. Where the fuck is this place? None
of these fucking buildings have numbers
on them - Uhhh, anyway, I’m almost at my
dinner, uhh, so meet me at the police

station at ten a.m. - there it is -
alright, so tomorrow morning and we'll...
you there? ... Don ... Damn it, fuckin’

piece of shit - Don, did I lose you? ...
Damn it, I don’t have time for this!
Fuckin’ cell phones - hello, hel--

We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
«+. Yeah ...

LOUIS (V.0O.)
«+. Oh, good, thought I lost you - so
you're going to surrender yourself,
you'll be arraigned, we'll post bail,
you're not a flight risk, but you’ll have
to surrender your passport, I’ve worked
it out with the DA, it’s best this way -
alright, I’m at my dinner, see you in the
morning.

Don hangs up, stone-faced, he just sits there, soon closes his
eyes, we JUMP into his head and SEE Ed, Al, Don and Pete marching
like soldiers, first Don, then Pete, Ed and Al. They March to
the song “The Ballad Of The Green Berets”. As they march they
pass a little boy, jumping and clapping, looking up at them, his
heroes. They look the boy in the eye and salute. Then they pass
a little old lady, jumping and clapping, looking at them with
proud and affectionate eyes, they look her in the eye and salute.
Then they pass a great looking babe with big fake breasts in a
tight sweater, jumping and clapping, looking at them with adoring
66.

after. BACK TO SCENE. Don picks up the phone, dials and we
experience a different Don. We can actually tell he’s feeling
pain. He doesn’t make a lot of jokes. In fact, he may cry.

DON
«+. Ma... Hi, it’s me ... I’m alright
.-. I am, I don’t know why I sound funny,
but only, um, I’m in a little trouble,
nothing that won’t work out, but remember
when they questioned me about Jessica
Black and it made the papers and all,
well, now they’ve decided to arrest me--
... No, please don’t fly out ... yes, I
have a lawyer ... Sure, a good one ...
He’s fine, I don’t want to use the guy
Jerry knows ... I’m fine, I’m fine,
really, it’s just a nuisance, just wanted
to let you know, it’s going to be in the
papers a lot and everything, you know,
wanted to warn you, it’s just a pain in
the ass is all, it’1ll all be taken care
of, just a pain in the ass - you know I
was thinking, your annual luncheon thing
is coming up, isn’t it? ... I could make
a donation this year, would you like me
to make a donation, I’d be happy to, I’d
like to, I’d like to make a donation ...
It’s no problem, everything’s gonna be
fine, let me make a donation ... Any nice
girls?? ... No, Mom, I haven’t met any
nice girls lately. It may be even
trickier than usual what with this
murder/rape thing. Women like liars and
cheats, but they just don’t go for
murderers and rapis-- ... Okay, okay,
okay, I’m sorry, I know you didn’t know
what to sa-- ... Please don’t fly out,
please try not to worry ... No, no flying
out here ... I gotta go ... I just wanted
to call to say I’m sorry if this is gonna
be a pain in the ass for you ... I’m just
sorr-- I don’t want people whispering
around you or being mean to you or
anything like that ... I know you don’t --
but -- I just don’t -- want anybody being
mean to you or anything -- you know -- I
don't know, I gotta go ... no flying out
«+. I gotta go - I didn’t do this...

INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Don sits at a table with Louis as Detective Dreyfus and Lt.
Abernathy hover over him. Don is numb.
67.

DREYFUS
«+. Maybe you'd like to talk to us. We
know you did it, be smart, let’s see what
we can work out.

DON
If I’m going to do an episode of “NYPD
Blue”, I’m gonna have to get paid.

DREYFUS
Your semen sample matched! But you
already know that. That along with her
panties found in the pocket of your tux
and sworn affidavits from fifteen
prominent members of the community saying
they saw you chasing her steps away from
where her body was found, makes you a guy
who's gonna spend a lot of time in
prison.

LOUIS
Well, we’ll see about that. We’re aware
of the evidence. My client has nothing
to say at this time.

DREYFUS
I hear “Life’s A Gas” is a very popular
show in the joint, imagine the cons’
delight, having one of the stars right
there in their midst. They’1l be killing
to get to you. I’11l bet none of them
have ever had a famous boyfriend before.

Louis is about to verbally reprimand Dreyfus, Don stops him.

DON
Fortunately, she doesn’t bring her work
home with her or the relationship
wouldn’t stand a chance.

ABERNATHY
Let’s get him booked.

POLICE STATION/FINGERPRINT DESK

MOVIE MUSIC PLAYS. IN SILENCE we SEE Don led to the
fingerprinting desk by two uniformed OFFICERS, as Dreyfus, Louis,
Abernathy and others stand by and watch. Don is dead, he doesn’t
acknowledge it’s happening. They must fingerprint him as if he
were a rag doll.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete thumb wrestling, joyously.
68.

POLICE STATION LOBBY

Don, withered, walks into the lobby with Louis from getting
printed. Woefully, Ed, Al, and Pete wait with a load of press,
“Entertainment Tonight”, “Hard Copy”, etc. When Don appears,
floodlights ignite, flashes go off and they converge on him, like
he was pulling into a paint store.

Louis forges him ahead through the press to Ed, Al and Pete, then
the door. As he goes, Don is shoved and jostled. Don closes his
eyes and we FLASH IN AND OUT of his head. When in, we SEE Ed,
Al, Don and Pete joyously tumbling recklessly and randomly,
somersaults, leaps, etc.

REPORTER #1
Did you do it?

REPORTER #2
How would Floyd Lloyd react?

REPORTER #3
Guilty or innocent, can you have a career
after this?

REPORTER #4
Don’t you have anything to say to your
many fans?

REPORTER #5
Hey, don’t you think “Life’s A Gas”?

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - LATER

In silence, seriously worried and depressed, the guys sit around
the living room. Suddenly, Don comes to life:

DON
I know what to do!

Thank God, hope, the rest of the guys come alive, look to Don.

DON (cont'd)
Party - tonight - a biggy!

Ed, Al and Pete look to each other in shock, find this wholly
inappropriate.

PETE
Don -- you may be going to prison.

AL
Most of the special analysts on TV are
saying it’s likely...
69.

DON
So when the cops come to tell me to lower
the music, I’m not gonna.

INT. PARTY/DON & PETE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The party is in full swing. Lots of people drinking inside and
out. Plenty of pretty girls, some bimbos, actor types - some
famous, producer-looking creeps, vile executives, the guys, the
wives, Bobby, Joe, Betty, Veronica, Wilma, Olivia, Mutt, etc.

During the party, we occasionally see Don, in the b.g., moving in
and out of frame, doing the gesture or calling “Here boy”.

DON
stands with some girls, he shouts across the party to Bobby:

DON
HEY, MR. TONGUE, OVER HERE.

ED & SUE
stand by themselves up against the wall, looking.

SUE
Ed, sweetie - I don’t think we’re in New
York anymore.

PETE

tries to schmooze. CHRIS, a really nice looking girl in every
sense, what a smile, dresses just right, definitely notches above
the rest of them, shyly comes up to him.

CHRIS
I just want to tell you how much I love
your house.

PETE
Oh -- thanks -- we just rent it.

CHRIS
I love renting. It’s so much less
hassle. I find this whole equity thing
to be a real burden.

They laugh.

PETE
I'm Pete.

CHRIS
Hi Pete, I’m Chris.
70.

PETE

-- Um, what do you do, Chris?
CHRIS

I’m a lawyer.
PETE

Oh, an entertainment lawyer.
CHRIS

No, sorry, just a corporate lawyer.
PETE

(perks up)

Really??! No, that’s terrific, really,
you know, that you have a real job - that
you're not in entertainment - it’s
refreshing -- um, why are you here?

CHRIS
To be perfectly candid, I have asked
myself that.
They laugh.

CHRIS (cont'd)
My friend Janey brought me.

PETE & CHRIS
She’s in entertainment.

They laugh.
CHRIS
Yes, she does something called -
“development”.
PETE

Oh, I’m often the victim of something
called “development”.

CHRIS
It’s like what an editor does, If I
understand correctly?

PETE
Yeah, but for some reason no editors will
do it, so it’s done by people with no
imagination, literary background or
reason to live. It’s exactly like
needing a doctor, so going to just
anybody who passed biology.
71.

CHRIS
Oh that sounds awful. My friend is
really a very nice pers--

PETE
I’m only kidding, it’s cool to knock
everybody and everything around here - we
all do it - actually, I don’t always - I
just felt the need to jump at the chance
to be cool.

CHRIS
Oh, thank you.

PETE
Sure - thank you for understanding that I
was struggling to flatter you there.

CHRIS
Wow, a need and a struggle - thanks
again. I just moved here, actually, I’m
sure soon I’1l start knocking every--

PETE
Where are you from?

CHRIS
Chicago.

PETE

Wow, a nice mid-western girl.
They seem smitten.
BETTY, VERONICA, WILMA, OLIVIA, ANOTHER GIRL & SUE
Sue stands nearby, listening to their chat, not yet part of it.

ANOTHER GIRL
That guy over there has a big cock, that
guy over there has a really small cock,
so does that guy over there, oh there’s
that guy who does the weather on channel
four, there’s that guy that raped and
murdered Jessica Black, oh and there’s
that guy I fucked at my birthday party
last week, I can’t remember if he has a
big cock, so he doesn’t...

Wilma notices Sue, brings her into the conversation.

WILMA
Hi. Join us.
72.

BETTY
Karen gave that guy a blow job in the
bathroom at uhh... anyway, one of the

bathrooms, and she says he has the
biggest cock she’s ever seen.

SUE

.-. I’m sorry, according to who?
BETTY

Karen Digman.
SUE

Can we trust Karen?

BETTY
Sure - I think - how do you mean?

SUE
Well, does Karen Digman know her cock?
Very nice to meet all of you, by the way.
See, here’s my point. If Karen’s only
been with tragically small men, then
she’s, in fact, poor Karen, whose notion
of big cock is terribly awry. You see, I
know you know what big cock is and I know
I know what big cock is, but I don’t know
if Karen knows what big cock is. Before
I heed Karen’s word, that’s something I
would like to know. Who amongst us need
endure yet more disappointment?

Sue has really given Betty, Veronica, Wilma, Olivia and Another
Girl something to think about.

PETE & CHRIS

are getting a drink together.

ED & SUE

CHRIS
That must be very exciting for you. Wow,
seeing something you wrote turned into a
movie, I’ll bet you’re nervous - and
that’s such a great cast, you must have
written a very good script.

PETE
I hope so.

CHRIS
I have a feeling it’s great.
73.

SUE
Oh, Ed honey, I’m having so much fun - I
just said “cock” ten times.

Dear Ed is so bewildered.
DON & JONATHAN
are having an intense conversation. JONATHAN is a pretty actor.

JONATHAN
«+. I live here because I have to for my
work. But I’m not willing to give up my
intellectual interests and concerns.
Yeah, it’s hard living here, finding
people you can talk to about something
other than acting - the business, but I’m
lucky I have one or two friends who are
intellectually stimulating, when I need
to have an intellectual conversation, I
have them...

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete lying on the grass napping. We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

DON
Uh-huh, I see. I’m a Viking.

JONATHAN
.-. I mean, look, I was fortunate to get
the education I got, I know that.
Studying in Europe and all, it makes it
hard, hard to find people to have
intellectual dialogues with...

DON
Yeah, it’s hard being a Viking too.

JONATHAN
... But my craft forces me to be here and
so here I must be and here I must stay
until I get successful enough that I
don't have to be here, they’1l fly me in,
they’1l come to me...

DON
As a Viking I don’t really have to be
here. But you gotta love the weather.

JONATHAN
.»+. I do worry that being forced to spend
so much time with people who aren’t as
educated and worldly as me may become too
tedious after a while...
74.

DON
I know what you mean, it’s impossible to
find another Viking around here,
sometimes I feel like I’m really the only
Viking in town.

JONATHAN
Um, what?
DON
Huh?
JONATHAN
What were you saying about Vikings?
DON
No, I was just mentioning how I am one.
JONATHAN
What do you mean?
DON
Nothing, I’m a Viking so I was just
saying so.
JONATHAN
What do you mean you’re a Viking?
DON
What do you mean, what do you mean I’ma
Viking?
JONATHAN

You mean you’re Greek or wherever Vikings
are from I forget?

DON
No I mean I’m a Viking. I have a hat
with horns on it, I’m a warrior, I like
to raid, loot, I’m an excellent ship-
builder.

JONATHAN
What do you mean?!

DON
I mean I’m a Viking. We were talking
about what we are - you’re a smart
person, I’m a Viking.

JONATHAN
You are not a Viking.
75.

DON
How come you get to be a smart person,
but I don’t get to be a Viking?

JONATHAN
Because I am a smart person.
DON
I am a Viking.
JONATHAN

I really am a smart person!

DON
I really am a Viking.

JONATHAN
Does my intelligence threaten you?
Because I’m not stifling my will, I have
opinions and--

DON
Not at all. But - what is a Viking if
not threatening, so you are surely and
understandably... but look, let me point
out that I’m willing to accept that
you’re a smart person, it’s you who won’t
accept that I’m a Viking.

JONATHAN
You're not a Viking!
DON
Then you’re not a smart person.
JONATHAN
Yes I am!
DON

Now wait a cotton pickin’ minute here or
as we say on the Viking vessels “hold
your horns”, this isn’t going to work if
you get to be what you want, but I don’t
get to be what I want.

JONATHAN
What are you talking about?!

DON
I’m with you, I’d much rather tell you
I’m a Viking than have to run around in
that hat, schleppin’ an axe or sword
around, seeking adventure - I like it
your way - just say you are whatever you
76.

want to be, that old-fashioned way of
actually having to be something sucks.

JONATHAN
I’m sorry, it’s not my fault that I was
educated in Europe and you weren't.

DON
Look, first of all, very nice to meet you
and I want my dog to meet you, please
remind me to make the introduction.
Secondly, I think you’re a hell of a guy
and now, thanks to your telling me, I
know you’re smart, but, you do talk too
much - now, I may not think Vikings are
Greek, but instead think they’re
Scandinavian like a real American
educated fool, but you don’t know that I
wasn’t educated in Europe, I could be the
one idiot with a European education, and
you also don’t know that I’m not a

Viking.

JONATHAN
Yes I do.

DON
No you don’t.

JONATHAN
Yes I do!!

DON
No you don’t.

JONATHAN

You're not a Viking!!

DON
You’re not a smart person.

JONATHAN
I am too a smart person!!

DON
I am too a Viking.

JONATHAN
I know you’re not a Viking, because...

DON
I know you’re not a smart person, becau--

JONATHAN
«+. If you were a Viking, you'd be a
77.

Bingo. Don says nothing, he just looks right at Jonathan and
lays an A#1 smirk/smile on him, as he nods.

PETE & CHRIS

Things are going well with these two. They’re on the couch
talking, just the two of them, as the party goes on around them.

PETE
I’1l get us a couple more beers, be right
back.

Off for beers, Pete makes a detour to Don.

PETE (cont'd)
I have to talk to you.

KITCHEN
Don and Pete come busting in. There are other people there.

DON
Get out. Everybody out, come on -- don’t
make me rape and murder you.

They get out.

PETE
I think I’m in love.

DON
That girl you've been talking to?! She’s
pretty!

PETE
She's like no other woman I can remember
meeting. She’s got the most beautiful
eyes and smile, she’s understanding,
she’s caring, she’s--

DON

Altogether wonderful, which is what I
insist on for you, so get back to her
before it gets out there’s a bona fide
fine and substantial woman at the party -
oh, don’t worry, we’re in L.A., no one’ll
care. Do me a favor, throw some beer in
the cooler, I’ll check the bar.

Don heads out, Pete goes to the refrigerator.
78.

AL & ED

ED
I’m never unhappy that I’m married. But
if I ever were to be. Ten minutes at
something like this would fix me right
up.

AL
Yeah, uh-huh -- I keep mistaking my wife
for most every woman here.

Al takes out his phone makes a call.

ED
Now you’re even.

PETE
is walking around the party, obviously looking for Chris.
SUE

with all the joy and delight of a child with a new toy, bounds up
to three women together, OLGA, MASHA and IRINA, and says:

SUE
That guy over there has a big cock.

OLGA
That’s my husband.

Olga, Masha and Irina storm away. Sue hasn’t quite got the hang
of this, yet.

PETE

is going through the house trying to find Chris. He goes down
the hallway that his bedroom is on, opens some doors, comes to
his bedroom door, opens it, there’s Chris and Bobby in his bed,
under the covers. Pete Freezes in shock.

BOBBY
Pete, please.

Pete quickly shuts the door, is a wounded man.
AL
is by himself by the booze, Pete comes rushing up.

PETE
Get drunk with me, will’ya?
79.

AL
Why?

PETE
You need a reason? Okay, as I came over
here, a girl was pointing at you and
said, “There’s the phone guy, he’s got to
have a small cock”.

Pete and Al hit the booze hard. SOME GIRL steps up.

SOME GIRL
Hi, could I have a cocktail? Vodka and
cranberry, if you have it.

Al makes her a drink.

CHRIS

SOME GIRL (cont'd)

I just had a feeling. My friend wanted
to go to the CAA party next, I couldn’t
wait to get to the rap party for the
Johnny Depp movie, but then I just got
this feeling that the guy who raped and
murdered Jessica Black party would be
really rocking right now, so here we are
and I was right. You gotta know the
order to hit the parties - that’s
everything -- everything.

is leaving with her friend Janey, good-byes to Don and Bobby.

PETE

is still at the bar getting drunk. Don gleefully steps up.

DON

Your friend Chris just left.
PETE

Uh-huh.
DON

Yup -- right after Bobby finished fucking
her. She didn’t even give him her
number. Boy, oh boy, that Bobby ain’t a
pleaser - well, at least he got some.

PETE
Fuck you, Don, you know I liked her! I
know he fucked her, I walked in on them!
You seem delighted!
80.

DON
Hey, Mr. generosity of spirit, our friend
Bobby needed that badly - and I am
delighted. Oh my God, your face - I was
behind the curtain. Pete - fucked her??
The guy wants a new dick, no more
erections for Bobby, ever. I wanted you
to find her with Bobby mounting her from
behind, but I didn’t think it was right
to ask her to drop her pants when we had
just met. I had very little time to get
the joke going - she was terrific about
it, by the way, I really like her. Then
it hit me, putting them in your bed -
that’s especially funny. She’s walking
to her car, hurry - and you’re an idiot,
by the way.

Beat. Pete tears out of the house.
EXT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Pete is running after Chris, screaming her name over and over.

Chris and Janey are at their car down the street, they hear Pete
and pause, Pete runs up to them, he’s very out of breath.

PETE
I have -- this very awful -- irredeemable
-- evil -- best friend Don.

CHRIS
Yes, we met.

PETE

Yeah, anyway, he just now told me about
the - joke. I didn’t know until now...

CHRIS

Yes, that was the whole idea, I was in on
the joke. Remember? I was one of the
people under the covers. You weren’t
supposed to know it was a joke - until
now. Don also told me that you really
like me and repeated many nice-to-hear
things you said about me...

Pete’s embarrassed.

CHRIS (cont'd)

«+. He wanted to know if I liked you too,
because, he said, if I didn’t he’d even
be willing to sacrifice the joke so that
you'd have more time to “work on” me, as
he put it. Though he was worried you’d
81.

joke “route”. Then he went on to say
Many nice things about you and why I
should like you, too. I told him he
didn’t have to sacrifice the joke...

PETE
Oh, um, I’m sorry, he, uh, I--
(suddenly realizes)
You told him not to sacrifice the jok--
that means... uh, uh, next Thursday is
the uh premiere of my uh movi--

CHRIS
I'd love to.

Chris smiles. Pete’s happy.
INT. PARTY/DON & PETE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Don is looking out the door. Once he sees that Chris and Pete
are fine, he goes back to the party with a smile. Jan, Jen, Jes
and Joy are steps away.

DON
Have you girls met the man known only as -
The Tongue? TONGUE, GET OVER HERE.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

MOVIE MUSIC PLAYS. In a room IN SILENCE we SEE Louis, Dreyfus,
Captain Abernathy, a D.A.'’s office type and some guy in glasses
and rubber gloves holding scissors and a clamp of sorts stands
over sitting Don. The scissors guy extracts a lock of Don’s
hair, then puts it in a plastic bag. Obviously Don has been
summoned to provide a hair sample. This is very abasing for Don,
Louis seems to be late for something, the others do their jobs.

Don closes his eyes, we JUMP into Don’s head and SEE the guys do
some more marching to “The Ballad Of The Green Berets”, only the
song and the marching pace is accelerated. (The film is not fast
motioned, the guys actually march very fast.)

INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The guys, Beth, Sue and Chris are in a limo, dressed up. Don has
brought along and is pouring champagne. All are very, very happy
and charged. It’s Pete’s big night, his movie premiere.

SUE
It was so nice of the studio to send a
limo. Mr. big shot.

AL
Premieres at the Academy are the biggest
one’s. You enter on a red carpet and
82.

stop to talk to the press. It’s really a
big deal, Pete.

DON
Is it just me or aren’t these things hard
to get in and out of?

CHRIS
This is so exciting. The six o’clock
news said the eleven o’clock news would
be reporting from the premiere.

DON
Again, I’m not getting it, why travel
this way if getting in and out sucks?

We leave on all their, except Don’s, joyful, optimistic faces.
EXT. WILSHIRE BOULEVARD - LATER

The gang from the limo walks Wilshire all looking as if they’ve
just come from a funeral. A more broken-hearted-looking person
you’ve never seen, poor Pete actually looks like he’s about to
cry. Don is pinching his nose as one might if there were an
awful stench about and remains pinching for the entire scene;
this, of course, affects his voice.

DON
My God did that stink! Wooooo!
Stinkerrrrr - stinker! Wooooo! They
have to go to extra trouble and expense
to make a movie that bad. There’s no way
a movie just ends up that bad. It takes
someone making sure. In order for a
movie to turn out as bad as this movie
did, someone actually has to be given the
specific job of seeing to it. Someone
literally has to be in charge of making
the movie bad - for a movie to be as bad
as this movie was. Their actual, job
description is to make sure the movie’s
bad - this is Harv, head of making movies
bad--

ED
Alright Don!

DON
And what was everybody acting so happy
for afterward? Why would those big
actors do this piece of shit and then act
so fucking happy after seeing it? Well,
at least we got rid of that impractical
vehicle.
83.

ED
Pete, your script was a lot better than
that movie.

Al pulls his cell phone away from his ear to say:
AL

Yeah, Pete, I read the script a while ago
but - what we just saw, is that what you

wrote?
PETE
(words aren’t coming)
I -- I -- I don’t know -- I guess -- some

of it. That -- wasn’t what I had in
mind. The funny parts were serious, the
serious parts were funny, characters that
were intended to be real were ridiculous,
so much was gone, mixed-u--

DON
Stinkerrrrr - boy did that stink. I
can’t get over that everyone pretends it
didn’t stink - do you get paid extra for
that - is it possible they don’t realize
it? And that director, he just directed
the biggest piece of shit ever made and
can a guy get any happier? You know what
it’s like? It’s like being sentenced to
life in prison with no chance of parole
and then having to write the judge a
thank-you note.

CHRIS
I think it’s wonderful that it got made.
And it’s an obvious compliment to your
talent that so many important and
talented people wanted to be involved
with your script.

DON
Yeah, so, not even worth mentioning that
it says written by you on the worst movie
ever made since film began.

CHRIS
And I think your friend should try and
look at things more positively - and you
should definitely not listen to him.

DON
This is me positive.
84.

PETE
(loses it)
I WORKED SO HARD!!!

DON
Pete, please behave, the checks cleared,
didn’t they? This ain’t no party, this
ain't no disco. Always remember, slap a
quick F on art, you got fart, baby.

ED
Don shut up - Pete, it’s your first
movie, they won't all be like this.

PETE
I cared so much! How do you go to the
trouble of writing something and not care
about it?! How do you not care!

CHRIS
Pete, I overheard several people saying
very nice things about the script. How
it was so much better than the mov--

PETE
Please, this is not what I want to be
remembered for.

DON
Come on, let’s hurry, we don’t want to
miss any of the enormous celebration
commemorating this failure. Finally, I
know why I belong here. See, I get
arrested for raping and murdering - I
throw a party. Hollywood makes a movie
that watching will feel like being raped
and murdered and they throw a gala
celebration. You would think people
would be apologizing, embarrassed, but no
- rejoicing. “We’ve failed miserably -
party!” “We’ve insulted all of mankind -
high-five!” “We've projected dim-
wittedness onto a screen - drinks are on
me!” If this had been a wonderful film,
that’s when we’d fall into the serious
depression, I guess - wait, one more,
once, when I was baby-sitting Lily, she
went to the bathroom and when she was
finished, she made me come and look at
what she’d done in there - Hollywood's
taken a shit.

Pete can’t take it anymore.
85.

PETE
LET GO OF YOUR NOSE! And I’m not going
to the party. You go - I’m not.

AL
Pete, you should make an appearanc--

PETE
I don’t care, Al! I’m going right home,
I’m locking myself in my room and I’m not
coming out until I’ve written the biggest
piece of shit screenplay that will ever
be written!

Pete storms ahead.
DON
It’s gonna be hard to beat this baby,
but, boy will that be cause for
celebration.
INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - DAY

Don is on the phone.

DON
.+. He hasn’t come out of his room yet,
Al, what do you want from me?? ... Okay,

yeah, I guess we’re just a couple guys
who hole up in our rooms from time-to-
time ... Yes, he knows we’re celebrating
his finishing the worst script ever
written - he’s looking forward to it ...
He assured me he’d be finished and come
out in time to meet at your office, in
time to grab a drink before the
reservation ... We appreciate how hard it
was to get a table at this place, Al...
Al, you’re on the phone, be happy ...
Look out the window, in immediate view
are at least eight hundred thousand
things worth getting violently nauseous
over, yet it takes Pete or me in our
rooms, Al, to upset you. Why is that?
This is all you don’t understand ...

INT. AL’S HOUSE - DUSK

Ed, Al, Don, and Pete enter Al’s plush house through the kitchen.
Ed and Al are in suits having come from work.

AL
Thanks for letting me stop home, these
are the most uncomfortable shoes.
DON
Is anyone gonna even bother asking why he
bought them then?

AL
I‘1l hurry, we'll lose the table if we’re
late, I just want to check the mail, real
quick.

86.

Al takes a look at the mail on the kitchen counter, where there

are also bags of groceries.

ED
Six and a half days huh?

PETE
From “Fade In” to “The End”.

ED
Is it any good?

PETE
Not at all. If I even slightly liked
something I wrote, I took it out.

ED
What’s it about?
PETE
It’s called, “Udder Crap”. It’s about

this evil scientist who wants to destroy
the world so he spreads this germ by
infecting cows causing this “crap” to
grow inside and then come out of the
cow's udders, which goes on to kill
people mercilessly. So, Arnold
Schwarzenegger and his Asian female or
Hispanic female or African American
female or AIDS victim side-kick must stop
the bad guy - hey, where’s Beth?

From 0.S. we HEAR a female SCREAMING. The guys all look at each
other with extreme concern, then dash out of the kitchen towards

the screaming.

LIVING ROOM

The guys stop and listen, now the SCREAMING, still 0.S., is

louder and clearly coming from the bedroom. All look

to Al with

“What do we do” expressions and then, “It’s the bedroom, so you

better go in alone, we’ll wait here and be there ina
you need us” expressions. Ed, Don and Pete have very
faces. Al understands, unfreezes himself and charges
door shuts behind him. The screaming stops. Ed, Don

second if
expressive
in, the
and Pete
87.

Finally the door opens, then an enormous bodybuilder - Mr.
Universe, BILL, sashays out buttoning up his shirt.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete sitting around, passing a bottle of scotch between them.
We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE.

Ed and Pete’s mouths fall open, but no noise comes out. Don

can’t help but guffaw a little as he expels in a high-pitched
tone:

DON
Oh, shit -- get him, Ed.

Al comes out of the bedroom, broken, staring at the floor. He
walks directly out of the sliding glass door into the back yard,
he needs to be alone. Beth is right behind him, closing her
robe; she runs to him and tries to speak. Her words are MUFFLED
through the glass. Bill steps up to the guys.

BILL
I’m going to need to collect for the
groceries. You guys want to cover that
or should I get it from them?

Ed, Don and Pete’s hands dive into their pockets for money.

LATER

Ed and Pete sit with Al on the couch and attempt to be consoling.
Beth stands. Al’s head is in his hands. All are and all is
awkward. Beth tries to say something helpful.

BETH
Al -- Al, I’m sorry -- I don’t know
what’s gotten into me...

AL
THE BODYBUILDER FROM THE SUPERMARKET! !
“What's gotten into you”??? You didn’
forget to pick up my dry-cleaning!!!
Would someone please get her away from
me.

i
t

Ed ushers Beth away, into the bedroom, AD LIBbing something like,
“Let me talk to you, Beth. Let’s give Al a moment.”

PETE
Al, maybe we should leave, let you and
Beth talk.

AL

No! I want to leave too. I just need a
second, please.
88.

PETE
Can I get you something? A drink? Some
water? Let me get you some water?

Al nods. Pete moves for the kitchen.
KITCHEN

Pete walks in and is immediately stopped dead in his tracks,
absolutely floored by what he sees.

DON (0.S.)
«+. You're kidding?! You ready for
another beer, Bill?

PETE
Donlililriiiyl

Don and Bill sit at the kitchen table having a beer, chummy as
could be.

DON
Hey Pete, get over here, you gotta hear
this. Bill was a high level executive
with a major ad agency, quit to deliver
groceries because he has a fear of
commitment and this job offers him the
perfect social life--

PETE
Don! Don! What are you doing??!!
DON
Chatting with Bill.
PETE
I’m afraid you're going to have to leave,
Bill.
DON
(to Pete)

Throw him out --

(senses Pete’s seriousness)
Alright, maybe you better go, Bill - nice
talking with you.

Bill leaves. Pete is really outraged by Don.

PETE
You go too far sometimes! This is too
insensitive. What’s the matter with you?
One of your very closest friends needs
you.
89.

DON
Let’s be honest, I’m the last thing he
needs right now.

PETE
Why are you so hard on him?!

DON
I’m not. I care about him, so I don’t go
easy on him, so that maybe he won’t make
a lot more stupid mistakes like marrying
Beth.

PETE
You treat Ed like he was gold.

DON
Ed is gold. Ed is forgivable like a dog
or child, I’d be a complete stinker if I
didn’t recognize that. I don’t want to
be a complete stinker.

PETE
Well you're getting dangerously close!
It’s as if you feel you must be
unattractive, or do you really draw the
line nowhere?! Do you really have
complete disregard for peoples’
feelings?!

DON
Hey, Al was in the other room--

PETE
Your new buddy just fucked the wife of
one of your best friends - maybe he
shouldn’t be invited into the fraternity!

DON
I don’t care that Beth fucked the
delivery guy - there’s a lot of reasons
why that might happen. I care that she’s
not nice to Al. You call this a bad
thing? Someone at last learning the
truth - now it’s up to him whether he
wants to be a schmuck or not - instead of
having it imposed on him. When you get
married, I hope you marry someone
heavenly, as you deserve, and if you are
so fortunate, I will think you
irredeemable if you do not absolutely
cherish her in every way - the truth
doesn’t kill’ya - just sucks - now let’s
cheer up Al -- and stop talking so much.
Don stomps into the living room, Pete is right behind him.

LIVING ROOM

Don and Pete join Ed and Al on the couch. Don slaps Al's knees.

DON
How’ya doin’ buddy?

Al can only try and smile.

DON (cont’d)
You know, life really is nutty -- if you
were to survey guys and ask them what’s
the worst thing that could happen?
Walking in on your wife getting nailed by
a bodybuilder would have to take first
prize. You got it, the brass ring of
awful things. Death is bett--

ED, AL & PETE
DON!!!

DON
SO HE REALLY KNOWS IT’S GONNA BE SMOOTHER
SAILING FROM NOW ON! There’s comfort in
that. There’s no way this could ever
happen twice. You might get struck by
lightning twice, but nobody's wife fu--

AL
Fuck you, Don. It’s not always funny.
Sometimes jokes are inappropriate.
You’re not always allowed to make jokes.
This isn’t funny--

DON
If it were funny, I wouldn’t make jokes.

PETE
Uh-uh - no, no, no! You behave right -
God-damn it!

Pete actually shoves Don, hard, more than once. He’s seriously
angry. Ed can’t believe what’s going on, he gets between them.

ED
Stop it! What’s happening??!!

PETE
I’m not knowing somebody that behaves
like he does!

ED

90.
91.

This is getting serious. Don realizes it, maybe even gets a
little defensive.

DON
You forgive your paltry Hollywood
existence where people take a shit on
that which you put your heart into and
then you say thank you very, very much,
but me you have no forgiveness for?!

ED
Don--

PETE
No forgiveness for yo i
is to forgive you! I’d just like more
from a friendship! Don’t you fucking get
bored being forgiven so much?!

1? ? To know you
,

DON
Al learned something today and now he--

AL
But it wasn’t a fun lesson, Don! It was
painful! It hurt me what I learned
today, so my friends are concerned about
that and they’re focusing just on that,
nothing beyond, just on my pain and their
caring is nicer to have than not to have -
you see how that works?!

DON
Al, Beth--

Al charges Don to actually fight with him, to actually hurt him.
Ed pulls him off.

AL
NO NOT BETH - ME!!! Just me!! It
doesn’t matter if I asked for it or was
stupid or anything else!! All that
matters is that it hurts - me!! I never
wanted a wife that cheated on me!! I
never wanted a best friend how was an
accused murderer and rapist, but I deal
with it!! Why can’t you deal with it?!!
This is too much for you to handle?!! Am
I being a burdensome friend right now?!!
Let me tell you, it’s great having a
friend that’s an accused murderer and
rapist!!

ED
Please let’s not do this!! Why are we
Don leaves.

AL
He’s all bullshit! You're all bullshit!
Now you’re all bullshit! You used to be
only some bullshit and different kinds,
some funny bullshit, some charming
bullshit, some bright bullshit, some
forgivable bullshit - now there’s nothing
but just plain bullshit!

DON
I get it -- take it easy.

recover and ponder. Silence.

EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Don pulls his car over to the curb, a woman, a prostitute,
GINGER, wearing not much, tight clothing bends over and pokes her

head into the passenger side of the car.

opens the door illuminating the interior light.

INT. DON’S CAR

As Ginger arrives in the car, she glances at Don.

She does.

GINGER
Hi baby-- HEY, FLOYD LLOYD!!!

DON
Shut the door please.

They drive on.

GINGER
Wow, Floyd Lloyd! I love that show, you
crack me up on that show. Wait, didn’t
you also murder and rape Jessica Black?
Maybe you better pull over!

DON
Wait, no--

Ginger pulls out a knife. This is all in a day’s work for

GINGER
I’m telling you pull over!! I’11 slice
you and start screaming “rape” - you

won’t get two blocks!

Don pulls over. As she goes to flee, Don makes a plea.

92.

Once he’s gone, the rest of the guys attempt to

After a moment she

her.
93.

DON
Please don’t leave, I'll pay you whatever
you like, we can stay right here, I
didn’t rape or kill anyone!
She reconsiders.

GINGER
We can stay right here?

DON
I’m turning off the car.

Okay, everyone relaxes, takes a pause.

DON (cont’d)
So, how’s business?

GINGER
When I can stay out of jail it’s okay.

DON
Yeah, same for me.

This makes Ginger laugh.

GINGER

It must be great being on TV.
DON

-- Yeah.
GINGER

What's it like?

DON
-- It’s like you imagine.

GINGER
Yeah, same for me.

This makes Don laugh.

DON
Do you ever meet anyone nice doing what
you do?

GINGER

Not really. They’re not all awful.

DON
It’s amazing how much our lives have in
common.
94,

GINGER
I guess you’re okay - you want a blow job
or something?

DON
No thanks - I mean yes, I want a blow
job. That’s the world’s stupidest
question if you ask me. The first thing
I want to do after I get a blow job is
get a blow job - and I’m sure a blow job
from you would not change my high opinion
of blow jobs, but -- let’s just not. I’m
gonna pay you anyway - whatever you want.
Let’s just keep trying to make each other
laugh for a while. I’11 tell you secrets
about famous people.

GINGER
Did you kill Jessica Black?
DON
-- No.
GINGER
Are you going to go to jail for killing
her?
DON
Hope not.
GINGER

That would suck. I go to jail pretty
often - for a night - even a night really
sucks.

DON
Yeah, I’d be going for a lotta nights --
if jail sucks and you go to jail pretty
often, um, uh...

GINGER
Yeah, the job sucks too. You gotta work
though.

DON

Couldn't you do something else?

GINGER
I don’t need to be saved.

DON
Oh -- that’s where we’re different.
95.

GINGER
This is what I find myself doing. It’s
work, I’m happy to say I have excellent
credit...

DON
Yeah, same here.

GINGER
.»». Yeah, it’s my job to get you off,
maybe that’s not for everybody, we can’t
all be TV stars.

DON
I go to work, do what they ask of me, if
all goes well, you sit at home and - I -
get you off.

EXT. MULHOLLAND (BLUE JAY WAY) - NIGHT

Don sits on the hood of his car looking out over the city. He’s
putting a dent in a bottle of scotch. Suddenly, expressionless,
he rises, walks to the edge, then screams as hard and loud and
desperately as one could, then screams some more.

DON
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! III Ith!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHE! !
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! III Ith!

  

INT. CANTER’S DELICATESSEN - NIGHT

It’s after two in the morning, the bars are closed, so Canter’s
is transformed from a New York style deli into the place where
L.A.’s night life participants hang out. The place is hopping
with the severest looking rock and roll types the world has to
offer - and Don, who sits alone drinking coffee looking sad.
Soon, Amy, not a rocker, the cute woman who asked for Don’s
autograph in the elevator, stands at his table. She has small,
real breasts.

AMY

DON
Hi, look, I don’t know if you want an
autograph or to say you talked to Jessica
Black’s killer or to spit on me, laugh at
me or what, but--

AMY
I want to buy you breakfast.
96.

DON
Oh, that’s very nice, thank you, but,
right now, I’d love to just be alon--

AMY
You look so sad. I’m sure I can cheer
you up. If nothing else, you’ll find me
irritating, which will also work to take
your mind off your troubles.

Don smiles,laughs a little, Amy sits down.

AMY (cont'd)
I’m Amy. I’ma big fan. I love your
show.

DON
Really? You seem kinda bright.

She laughs. She has a nice laugh.

AMY
You don’t like being on television?

DON
Um, it’s not that so much as... um -- I’m
not doing with my - “acting” what I
intended to. Acting can very gratifying -
- it hasn’t been lately.

AMY
I think I understand. I think you’re
being hard on yourself. You shine, you
have a sparkle on the show that the
material can’t diminish. You actually
make the show okay.

DON
Oh -- well, I mean, I don’t know,
whatever, thank you - do you want
something?
AMY
Yes.
DON
(calls off)
Dear.

SAME - LATER

Amy has had something to eat.
AMY
Excuse me while I go to the restroom,
I’1ll be right back.

Dear steps up to take the plate.

DEAR
Is she finished?

DON
Yes, Dear, I believe so.

DEAR
She's a very nice girl.

DON
Yeah, I’d like her more if she didn’t eat
jelly with her lox and bagels, that I
find a little concerning, but yeah.

DEAR
Let her eat jelly with lox if she’s a
nice person. She comes in here a lot -
very nice girl.

DON
Yeah, I think so too - she is, yeah -
thanks - Dear.

EXT. CANTER'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Don sees Amy to her car. This is a kinder, gentler Don.
DON
.»-. I’m glad you came over -- uh - uh --

you know, I have a thing going on - some
trouble at the moment - I understand

if... I’d like to see you again, but--
AMY
I know all about your - “thing”. I don’t
care at all. Get in.
DON
What?
AMY

Get in my car. I want to take you
somewhere. You can leave your car here.

They get into Amy’s VW bug.
98.

EXT. BLUE JAY WAY - NIGHT

The famed parking spot that overlooks the Valley glittering
beneath. Don and Amy, in the bug, are parked here.

INT. BUG

Don and Amy are not enjoying the view, they are smooching - and
pretty well, they could use a bigger car, but they’re liking
smooching each other. Suddenly, most uncharacteristically, Don
pulls away.

DON
Can I just tell you something?

AMY
Don’t take long.

DON
Um, I’m so glad I met you. Uhhh, I was
feeling stuff I’ve never felt before -
bad stuff - I didn’t know I had that kind
of stuff in me. Then you popped up, now
I'm feeling other stuff I’m not used to
feeling -- I guess all I want to say is --
I’m having a nice time.

Was that Don who just said that? Murder and rape charges can
have an effect on a guy.

AMY
Ohhh, me too -- you’re much nicer than
Jessica Black - I mean, I only compare
you ‘cause you’re both stars - you’re
very nice period.

Freeze, pause. Then:

DON
Did you know Jessica Black?
AMY
Not really. I tried to get to know her.
DON
-- When?
AMY

The night she died.
The uneasiness increases in Don.

DON
You were ther--
99.

AMY
I work at the hotel. I was working the
coat room for the party.

DON
-- Oh, I see. So, you “tried to get to
know her”, like when she was checking her
co--

AMY
No, she didn’t check a coat -- but she
was in the coat room - well, you know.

DON
Amy, do you know something?

AMY
Yeah - everything.

A distinct thickness consumes.

DON
Do you know who killed her??
AMY
Uh-huh.
DON
Who??
AMY
Me. ...

Don is paralyzed and mute and can’t do anything about it.

AMY (cont'd)
.+. I’m so sorry, Don. Trying to get to
know her, is how I ended up killing her,
I didn't plan on killing her or want t--

EXT. BLUE JAY WAY - CONTINUOUS

Don jumps out of the car. Amy follows, calls after him. He’s
trying to flash into his head, blinking mightily repeatedly.

AMY

.-. I never meant for you to get into
trouble. This is really why I approached
you - I mean, I really am a big fan -
honest, your biggest, have always wanted
to meet you - well, since I saw the show,
but I’ve been actually trying to talk to
you lately, for a while now, I’ve even
been following you, when I can, but it’s
100.

whole trouble with Jessica started, when
I had an opportunity to be alone with
her...

Scared, sickened and more, Don tries to flee, where to? She
comes after him.

DON
(to himself)
And my mother was only worried I'd do
drugs if I moved here.

AMY
.-. Well, I shouldn’t call her Jessica,
it’s not like I really knew her, people
do that a lot, refer to people as if they
knew them, when they don’t, I’m so
embarrassed. Anyway, I just feel so bad,
I just would never want anyone to take
the blame for something I did...

He’s keeping distance between them. He speaks very cautiously.

DON
But -- I am -- taking the blame for
something you did.

AMY
And I feel so bad about it Don, I really
do. I want to try to make it up to you.

DON
Well -- is there anything you can do?

AMY
I don’t know - I really want to - can you
think of anything?

DON
Well -- since you did it -- you could
tell them that you di--

AMY
Then I'd go to jail. I don’t want to go
to jail, Don. I don’t want you to go to
jail either. Besides, it wouldn’t be
enough for me to just tell the police I
did it, I’d have to prove it...

Don is very scared and confused and shocked and full of wonder
over how the fuck he got this life.

AMY (cont'd)
.+. We can talk about it. Let’s get out
of here. My car is no fun to make-out
101.
in. I’m looking around for something
bigger...
INT. PETE’S CAR - NIGHT
Ed, Al and Pete drive along; each still disconcerted.
PETE
Boy, quite a day - quite a lately. How

you holding up, Al? Shall we get another
drink somewhere?

ED
Should we just check on Don?
AL
I don’t care about Don.
ED
Just to make sure he’s okay.
PETE
He’s not home, I just tried, but the hell

with him.
INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Don and Amy come walking in. Don is trying so hard to seem
normal, but he’s never kept company with a murderer before and is
very uncomfortable to say the least.

The apartment is not nice. She’s made some effort, but all the
furniture looks like it came from or should go to the Salvation
Army. Nothing nice about the neighborhood. She’s obviously
living on a budget. It’s a small one bedroom, open kitchen in
the living room. It’s in one of those buildings where all the
units’ front doors are along an outside walkway on one side of
the structure, two or three identical floors, each apartment the
same, like a motel.

AMY
Make yourself at home.

DON
Okay, yeah, thanks, um, yeah, okay - nice
place...

AMY

Oh, thanks - are you okay? You’re not
afraid I'd hurt you? I was just kissing
you. I can’t imagine your doing anything
that would make me want to hurt you, Don.
I didn’t want to hurt Jessica. Just
relax and make yourself at home; the
hotel doesn’t pay that well, but I think
102.

DON
Oh, yeah - uh, y-y-you make tips though,
right?

AMY

Yeah, that’s where you make most of your
money. That night I was working the coat
room, the night you were there...

DON
The - night - Jessica Black was - kil--

AMY
Yeah, the night I killed her, that was an
okay night - for the coat room. I don’t
know, you don’t usually do that well in
the coat room. Because of the weather, I
guess coats aren’t that popular in L.A.
But can I tell you something, Don? Don’t
get offended - actors are lousy tippers.
Very cheap. You wouldn’t think so since
so many of them have been waiters before -
you know? But yeah, very cheap.

DON
Um, um, Amy, would you mind... could you
tell me... is it alright if I ask you -
how - and why - you killed Jessica Black?
AMY
Sure. You want something to drink?
DON
No thanks.
AMY

I didn’t want to kill her, I wanted to
talk to her, get an autograph for my Mom,
tell her how much I truly and deeply
admire her work, see what she was like -
seemed fair enough to me. My shift was
over, the next girl hadn’t shown up yet,
she’s always late, and I needed to use
the restroom badly, so I left the coat
room unmanned and hurried, when I came
back I noticed that you and Jessica were
in the back. I was surprised at first,
but then, wow, two of my favorite stars
fucking each other, so I snuck in and hid
amongst the coats - I could’ve sung a
song and you wouldn’t have noticed - I
was right next to you.

DON
103.

AMY
So you left her there to sleep on the
floor - remember?

DON
Yes-yes-yes - she told me to...

AMY
Yeah, so when you left, there I was alone
with Jessica Black, I couldn’t believe
it, the next girl still hadn’t shown up,
but like I said my shift was over and
she’s always late and I didn’t want work
to get in the way of my time with
Jessica, so I ran and clocked out, and
clocked the other girl in, so ifa
Manager came by and saw no one standing
there, since I knew I was going to be in
the back on the floor with Jessica, the
other girl would get in trouble, not me.
So then I ran back to be all alone with
Jessica, which is something I’ve dreamt
of happening - and granted I had to wake
her up, but still, I was very nice - why
wasn’t she? How does someone get to be a
murderer, how does someone get to be a
shit? That’s what I remember thinking
the whole time right up to when I started
strangling her.

DON
Huh -- you were able to kill her with
your bare hands?

AMY
I’m very strong. I go to the gym a lot.
I’m a really good softball player - you
want to go to bed? I’m pretty tired.

DON

Um, um, um, Amy, I don’t know if it’s
such a great idea that we sleep together.
I mean, we just met. I think I’d be a
little uncomfortable sleeping with you on
the first date - I mean, the girls you
think you may really like, you like to
wait a little before sleeping with.

AMY
Oh, Don, that’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever...

She kisses him.
104.

AMY (cont'd)
The truth is, Don, I don’t think I would
let you make love to me tonight. I just
thought we’d cuddle.

DON
Amy, I’m not super human, I get into bed
with you, I’m gonna wanna do more than
cuddle.

AMY
I don’t want you to go home.

DON
Uh, yeah -- the truth is I can’t really
go home, I had a little falling out with
my roommate - I could go to a hotel...

AMY
I want to make you breakfast in the
morning and then I want us to spend the
day together. We need to figure out how
I can help you with your - “thing”.

DON
Oh, yeah, well -- I could sleep on the
couch. I’m fine on the couch. It’s the
best idea. You may need to lock your
door - I hope there isn’t an axe around,
if there is I may use it on the door.

Amy laughs, Don pretends to laugh along. Suddenly, Amy has a
flash which gets her very excited.

AMY
Oh, Don!! There’s just one thing we have
to do before we go to bed!
CUT TO:

SAME - MOMENTS LATER
Don and Amy are sitting on the couch watching TV. The room is
dark except for the illumination of the television. They are
watching “Life’s A Gas", which we only HEAR.

ANOTHER CHARACTER (V.O.)
... Where are you?

FLOYD/DON (V.O.)
Down here, in the well.

ANOTHER CHARACTER (V.O.)
How'd you get down there, Floyd?
105.

FLOYD/DON (V.O.)
Uhhhh, is that one of them philosophical
questions? Someone must have wished me
well -- Nah, that would never happen.

We HEAR uproarious alleged audience laughter, which is nothing
compared to the laughing Amy’s doing. We watch them watch.

AMY
This is something else I’ve dreamt of -
actually watching “Life’s A Gas” with
Floyd Lloyd.

DON
Y-y-you have every episode on tape -
truly??

No answer, she’s riveted to the TV.

ANOTHER CHARACTER (V.O.)
Floyd there’s no ladder around, there’s
no way to get you out.

FLOYD/DON (V.O.)
Okay, I’1l just stay down here the rest
of my life then - bye.

We HEAR yet more extreme, undeserved canned, or idiots’ laughter.
Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into his head and SEE Ed, Al, Don
and Pete marching, but he’s snapped out of it by Amy’s loud
hysterical laughter and unbridled adoration which comes with, “oh
you're so funny” shoves and slaps, etc.

ANOTHER CHARACTER (V.O.)
.-. Don’t worry! I’11 go get help.

FLOYD/DON (V.O.)
Okay, great - you know what would be
great down here? A pet fish.

SAME - LATER

The lights and the TV are off, street light beams through the
window. Amy must be in the bedroom, the door is shut, Don keeps
looking at it nervously. Amy has nicely made up the couch for
Don. He lays on it with his hands behind his head, wide awake, a
person can’t get more awake. He tries to relax, but he’s just
about hyper-ventilating. Many times he shuts his eyes tight
trying to go into his head - no dice. He snaps to a sitting
position, calms himself, lays back down, this happens a few
times. Eventually he gets up and goes rushing into the kitchen,
quietly starts looking for something, opens drawers, etc., makes
some racket by mistake, from the bedroom Amy calls out:
106.

AMY (0.S.)
What are you doing?
DON
Just getting a little snack.
AMY (0.S.)
You want me to get it for you?
DON
No, I’m fine.
AMY (0.S.)

Okay, help yourself.

Don finds what he’s looking for, a large knife. He goes to leave
the kitchen, then realizes something, whispers to himself.

DON
Better get some food.

Opens the refrigerator, scans, pulls out a log of raw chocolate
chip cookie dough, takes the knife and the dough to the couch,
spends a lot of time arranging the placement of the knife so it’s
in arms reach with the dough nearby so it looks like the knife is
there to cut the dough, as he lays down, tries to sleep, keeps
reaching for the knife, etc.

INT. ED, AL & PETE’S HOMES - EARLY MORNING
They are on the phone with each other. They’re worried.

PETE
+. I haven’t heard from him ...

ED
«+. Me neither ...

AL
«+. Me neither ...

PETE, ED & AL
.-. What should we do? ...

INT. AMY’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

Amy walks out of the bedroom into the living room freshly
showered, wearing her robe with her hair in a towel turban.

AMY'S POV - DON
sits on the couch, all dressed and ready, the bedding neatly

folded, an enormous smile forced on his face. He clearly hasn't
been to sleep.
107.

BACK TO SCENE

AMY
Did you sleep well?

DON
Oh, yeah, great couch.

She gives him a kiss. He’s not very comfortable with all this
kissing a murderer.

AMY
What’s wrong?

DON
Nothing! Nothing.

AMY
What would you like for breakfast? And
what should we do today?

DON
Um, Amy, I wonde--

AMY
You're canceling our day together?

DON
No! No! Absolutely not! Not for
anything! It’s just this has all popped
up so unexpectedly. I have a couple
things I really need to do, could knock
‘em off in a couple, three hours - could
we hook up later? Give me the morning.

INT. POLICE STATION/DETECTIVES’ ROOM - MORNING

Desks and ringing phones. Ed, Al and Pete arrive, see Detective
Dreyfus at her desk, go over.

PETE
You have to help us, please.

DREYFUS
What can I do? I'd help if I could.

ED
There must be something you can do.
Something you haven’t tried. Look
harder.

DREYFUS
I appreciate that you care about him, I
really do. I don’t know what else to do.
108.

INT. PETE’S CAR - A LITTLE LATER
Ed, Al and Pete drive along solemnly and silently.
INT. POLICE STATION/DETECTIVES’ ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Don is with Detective Dreyfus at her desk. She is looking
through an open file folder.

DON
«+. I guess you didn’t hear me. I know
who the real killer is. I got her. I
apprehended the killer. She confessed to
me. Is there a reward, by the way? I
guess my work here is done. There’s
other dangerous lawbreakers out there in
need of captur--

DREYFUS
Yes, we interviewed your Amy, another
detective took her statement, she was the
coat check girl on duty that nigh--

DON
Right, right, like I said.

DREYFUS
Yes, she was there, working, but unlike
you, she was not seen in the vicinity of
the murder at the time of the murder, in
fact, her shift had ended, she had
already clocked out. She has no motive,
no connection, told us nothing that
wasn’t in the papers - I’m sorry, I just
need the killer, it’s okay if it’s not
you. In fact, I wouldn’t mind at all if
it weren't you, okay?

DON
She confessed!

DREYFUS
To you. Twenty-three people have
confessed to the rape and murder of
Jessica Black to me. The department, at
last count I heard, had taken over three
hundred confessions. Regardless - no
confession matters without evidence.

DON
She described what happened to me in
great detail!
DREYFUS
A murder takes place in the coat room
where a girl works, the newspapers cover
the story thoroughly, I’m sure she had no
trouble coming up with a convincing tale.

DON
Now look, the killer has come forward.
Not only did I not do it, but we know who
did - you have pretty eyes by the way -
now arrest her and un-charge me.

DREYFUS
There’s no evidence linking her - thank
you - evidence is key, we have to have
it. We did not choose you. It’s not
that we think that show you’re on is for
idiots, well, yes we do, but that’s not
why we arrested you. We have evidence,
lots of it. We had to arrest you.

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - DAY

Don comes slowly walking in, he’s running out of fight.
also not looking good, is working on his lap top in the
room. When he sees Don, he stands. They don’t look at
other, it’s very uncomfortable for them both.

DON

Hi.
PETE

Hi.

Pause.

DON

I, I -- have a problem.
PETE

I’m sorry??
DON

I, I don’t know what to do. I found the
killer - well, she found me.

PETE
You found the killer?? You know who
killed Jessica Black???

DON
Yeah.

PETE

109.

Pete,
living
each
110.

DON
I did. It’s not enough.

PETE
What do you mean?? How do you know who
the killer is???

DON
She told me.

PETE
She told you??! The killer??! In
person??! She was like close enough to
touch you??!

DON
Oh, we've gotten very close, very
quickly.
PETE
What crazy thing are you doing, Don??!
DON
I’m just trying not to be a rapist and
murderer -- she told me all about how she

did it - what should I do?

PETE
Will she tell the police???

DON
That part’s still up in the air.

INT. ED & SUE’S HOUSE - DAY
Ed, Al and Pete are conferring in the living room.

ED
What do you mean he’s having lunch with
her at the Ivy right now??

AL
Has he gone more insane??

ED
Why isn’t he with the police??

PETE
He went to the police, there’s nothing
they can do, there’s no evidence, she
just admitted it to Don. Her name is
Amy.
111.

AL
Don is having lunch with a murderer,
named Amy, at the Ivy??

PETE
We need to get her to go to the police
and turn herself in or something.

ED
How??

AL
Maybe if we took her to Spago for dinner.

ED
What does she want?

Pete doesn’t know.

AL
Weekends at the Ritz Carlton in Laguna.

PETE
Look, I don’t know what to do.

AL
He actually came to you and told you?

Pete nods. They all stand, head toward the door with urgency.
AL (cont'd)
I’m still livid. The guy is inexcusable
and unforgivable.
PETE
I feel like I have high blood-pressure
I’m so pissed off at him.

ED
Ivy On The Shore or Robertson?

EXT. IVY - DAY

Don and Amy occupy a table on the patio (of the Ivy on
Robertson). Famous people are sprinkled about.

AMY
.-. This is so nice. And so extravagant,
Don, I feel like a princess.

DON
Only the best for you.

AMY
112.

The WAITER steps up and correctly waits to be acknowledged. He
can only wait so long though, of course.

DON
In which case, perhaps a light lunch
would be advisable -- Amy, um -- to be
completely honest with you - please don’t
get offended or react in any kind of big
way - but -- uh -- I ama little
uncomfortable with the whole you having
murdered thing...

AMY
What do you mean?
DON
It’s just -- sleeping with a killer - I’m

sure you’re not supposed to do that. I
hope you understand.

WAITER
May I start you off with something to
drink this afternoon?

DON
Give us a few more minutes please.

The Waiter leaves, he hears this sort of stuff daily.

AMY
You're very concerned with supposed to’s,
aren't you?

DON
It plays a role in my life, lets me cut
myself a little slack when it comes to
other things.

AMY
But it’s okay to a cop a feel of a
killer's tits?

DON
Well, come on Ame, I was, you know, into
the moment - and besides, yours are

real...
AMY
Oh, that’s not so unusual.
DON
You kidding? The nuns have fake breasts
in this town -- and original screenplays.

It was like coming upon a dinosaur, there
113.

besides, I didn’t know you were a
murderer then - remember?

AMY
So last night when you said you didn’t
want to sleep with me because you think
you might really like me, that was all
bullshit?

DON
No, not completely. You are cute.

AMY
If you like me, then that’s all that
should matter. Maybe in time something
will develop between us.

DON
I don’t have a lot of time, Ame.

ED (0.S.)
May we join you?

Don looks with a start. Ed, Al and Pete are standing at the
table. Don is touched, but of course fights showing it. It’s a
little uncomfortable for all the guys, but there’s an important
matter at hand. All greet and introduce. Al is on his phone.

BIGGER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

They do lunch. Ed, Al and Pete try to help. They’ve never eaten
lunch with a murderer before. Al's still on his phone.

AMY
«+. I remember you guys from that night,
you didn’t check coats, but I saw you.
He was on the phone then, too.

Ed gives Al a “get off the phone” look. Pete says it as
discreetly as possible:

PETE
Could you get off the phone??

Al holds up a finger, asking for a moment, soon he does lay the
phone on the table.

AL
I’m very sorry, that was very rude,
excuse me - so, where’ya from, Amy?

AMY
I’m a native.
114.

DON
I didn’t know that. A born and raised
Los Angelito - you wear it well, Ame.

Ed, Al and Pete vigorously agree. Al drops his fork.

AL
Shit - Oh excuse my language - Ame.

At a loss for what to say next, uncomfortable silence.

PETE
So, you hail from right here in the City
of Angels, Ame. That's very interesting.
It’s been about a year for us.

AL
Yeah, finally starting to feel like I
know my way around. So Ame, um, Don
tells us you - murdered Jessica Black...

AMY
Yes, I wish it hadn’t come to that, but
yes, that’s what ended up happening.

ED
Y-y-you never know what unexpected
occurrences might - occur - in a day.

DON
I hope you don’t mind my telling them...

AMY
No-no, that’s okay, I know they’re your
best friends.

PETE
Ame, how would you feel about us telling
the police you did it?

AMY
You don’t like me, I thought we were
getting along well...

ED
No! Ame, no! It’s not that! It’s just
our first allegiance is to Don, we’ve all
known each other since we were
children...

AMY
I understand. If I confess, I’ll go to
jail...
115.

ED
But Don--

AMY
May go to jail. Don can afford an
effective lawyer, Don can prove it wasn’t
premeditated, Don will have fans in the
jury box or jurors with children or
friends who are fans, Don’s time in
prison would be nicer than my time. I
have to confess, they have to prove Don
did it, so he may not go to prison and
then everything works out great for
everybody.

The guys look to each other, they’re stumped.

ED
Oh boy.
AL
Ame, can you... would you mind telling us

what happened?
AMY
Oh, sure. I didn’t start off wanting to
kill her. You see, what happened was...
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Dreyfus walks out of the police station after a hard day’s work.
Don emerges from the shadows and approaches.

DON
Hi.

Dreyfus squints to see who’s talking. Don’s still some feet away
and not in the light. He continues to walk toward her.

DON (cont’d)
It’s Ken, Barbie’s friend.

She sees who it is, perhaps is a bit surprised. Don is feeling
rather sensitive lately, he reacts with real concern:

DON (cont’d)

Did I scare you??!! You’re not scared of
me, are you??!! I’m... I’m... I
wouldn't... ev--

DREYFUS

I couldn’t see you. You never scare me,
you just piss me off. If you scared me,
I'd just beat you up and shoot you -- can
Pause.

116.

DON
I’m sorry I made fun of your breasts --
first time I saw you all I wanted to do
was go to bed with you, you wanted to
arrest me. Truth is, I’ve come to want
more than to just get you in bed - that
doesn’t happen often - never - you still
want me to get fucked by men in prison -
that hurts a little -- last night I was
kissing this girl when I really wanted to
be kissing you. I may be going to
prison, for I don’t know how long, and
I’m spending some time thinking about

you...
DREYFUS

I’m really doing everything I c--
DON

Honestly, all I wanted was to tell you

that.

Don turns and walks away.

INT. PETE’S CAR - NIGHT

Ed, Al and Pete drive along.

AL
Today at lunch, I apologized for saying
the dirty word “shit”, in front of a
murderer.

ED
There’s got to be something we can do.

PETE
You'd sort of think finding the actual
killer would be enough.

AL
-- What if Amy didn’t do it?

ED
What do you mean?

AL
We don’t know she did it. She told us
she did, her story seems real, so we
believe her - but, well, let’s face it,
we want to believe her.
117.

PETE
This really wasn’t supposed to happen.
You get old one day. Old like when you
were a kid you never thought you would.
So you rise to the occasion, you realize
stuff like parents die, you have to make
a living now. Then people get married -
you realize you’re old enough to get
married - unbelievable. Kids come, you
can even afford to have them, there’s a
wife there to go with them, why not, the
way it’s supposed to be, I’m old enough
to be doing this. Rise to the occasion.
We’re adults. We know some personal
tragedy could pop up now, divorces, death
-- but not people you love going to jail
for rape and murder - that never occurs
to you as a possibility - that’s not on
the list of shit that may happen.

Silence.
DON’S HEAD

Ed, Al, Don and Pete do all the things we’ve seen, from Don's
head, in fast motion (where the film is actually speeded up).
Don’s head is suddenly interrupted when we HEAR:

DREYFUS (0.S.)
Hey.

And we SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. POOL/DON & PETE’S HOUSE - DAY

Don opens his eyes with a start from being interrupted. He lies
motionless on that raft in the pool. The sky looks very violent,
a thunder and lightning storm is poised to strike. Ominously,
Dreyfus is at the pool’s edge.

DON
Can’t beat the weather here -- I’m not
going with you. You can send the entire
police force in here, nobody's getting me
out of this pool. I’m on television - I
get to lounge in the pool - that’s what
celebrities are, people who lounge in
pools. If I’m supposed to be punished,
God can punish me right here. I don’t
know what I’ve done, but if I’ve done
something wrong, I’1l accept my lumps -
like a man - right here - no one’s
getting me out of the pool.
Thunder claps prophetically. This is dangerous, he should get

out.

DREYFUS
Did you do it?

Don starts to cry.

DON
You mean that matters? Did I do it? I
am truly someone who does not care what
people, any person, thinks and I can’t
bear that someone I’1l never meet thinks
there’s a chance I might’ve. Did I rape
and/or murder somebody, anybody? Of
course not. I couldn’t... it’s not poss--
Inconceivable, absolutely incon-- I--

Don’s having horrible trouble letting himself get it out.

DREYFUS
Why not?! You tell me! You couldn’t
rape and murder?! Tell me why! Tell
me!!

DON
Because it’s wrong to! Why do you think
I find everybody so unforgivable - right
and wrong is just common sense...

Gets off his raft, delivers the following standing in the pool.

DON (cont’d)

«+. I can tell someone they’re beautiful,
when in fact it’s best to wait an hour
after meals before viewing them - if
that’s what they need, I could do that.

I can tell someone they’re good, when
they're single-handedly responsible for
making God feel like a failure - I could
do that - and even will. If someone
needs to be smart, when the most
painfully obvious thing on earth is that
they’re not? I’1l1 tell them they are
everyday. I could. But I can’t rape
and/or murder, I can’t say I did and I
can’t be punished for it - that I can not
do, could never do, not for anyone,
because it’s wrong to.

 

Pause. More thunder and lightning. Don gets back on the raft.

DON (cont’d)
Nothing’s getting me out of this pool.

118.
119.

Suddenly the pool skimmer scoops his head and pulls all of Don to
the edge of the pool. Dreyfus, drops the skimmer, bends down,
grabs Don by the hair, yanks him out of the pool and manhandles
him into a patio chair. He AD LIBs “HEY!” and “OW!”.

Forcefully, she takes his hands and places them profoundly on her
breasts (over her shirt).

DREYFUS
Real, you son of a bitch! Not even a
little fake - enhanced in no way
whatsoever!

That’s all, she throws his hands away and walks for the door.
Don reaches out for the breasts that have just left his hands.

DON
And winners.

At the door, Dreyfus stops and turns back to Don.

DREYFUS
You make that show you’re on watchable.
Your friend had me listening on the other
end of his cell phone during the lunch
you had with “Ame”...

DON
(to himself)
Al.

DREYFUS
... That was enough for me to get a
search warrant. She’s confessed
everything. We found a locket of Jessica
Black’s hair she took, an autograph she
made her write as she was choking her and
the hotel uniform she was wearing with
Jessica’s vomit on it - that she
purposely hadn’t washed - very amazing
what can become a trend - anyway, you’re
cleared of all charges. Oh, but
regardless of all that, her detailed
description of how you make love and the
size of your penis, makes so much sense,
she was definitely there. Good thing
she’s going to jail - you don’t want her
free to spread this information. You
have nice friends - how the fuck did that
happen? Dinner, tomorrow, Patina, eight
o’clock - sharp.

Dreyfus walks out.

INT. DON & PETE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ed, Al, Pete, Sue, Lily and Chris wait in the living room.
There’s a joy about them, they know the good news.

AL

.--He’s with the dog again???!
PETE

Yes, Al!
ED

He yelled out that he’1ll be in soon.
Calm down, Al...

We HEAR a door open and Mutt scurries out followed by Don, who
holds up a finger asking for patience, then snaps his fingers and
points to Al, Mutt goes over, then Don tugs on his own ear, Mutt
says:

MUTT
Sorry.

All are amazed. Don holds up the finger again, all calm down,
then Don again snaps his fingers and points to Ed. Mutt goes
over, Don tugs on his ear, Mutt says:

MUTT (cont'd)
Sorry.

Same thing with Pete. Don tugs on his ear, Mutt says:

MUTT (cont'd)
Sorry.

All are touched and impressed. Don holds up the finger again,
he'd like a moment. Clears his throat.

DON
-- That goes double for me.

All are terrifically amazed, they try to rise to come to Don, but
he stops them with the finger. He disappears for a moment and
returns with a brand new set of Berthas (golf clubs) ina
beautiful bag with a big red ribbon on it. He gives them to Al.

DON (cont’d)
Here, I found these.

All gush a little, maybe hug some, kisses from the girls for Don,
Don tries to play it all down of course. Pete runs to the
refrigerator and gets a bottle of champagne.

LILY
121.

Once Lily is gone, Al releases something on his mind.

AL
Okay, you didn’t murder Jessica Black,
you didn’t rape Jessica Black, but you
did fuck Jessica Black - and that’s how
your semen sample matched - right?

DON
Right. I had a feeling they just assumed
she was raped because they found her
murdered, freshly fucked and wearing no
panties, but I wasn’t gonna say anything.

PETE
Why not??

DON
They hurt my feelings -- and what
difference does it make - “Oh no, police

officers, she wasn’t raped and murdered
she was fucked and murdered and I only
did the fucked part”.

AL
What about all those people who saw you
chasing her?

DON
I love that part. Those fifteen
prominent members of the community who
saw me chasing her, but missed her
shouting, “Chase me, Floyd! Chase me,
Floyd!” - if they thought she was being
“chased”, why didn’t they do anything?

ED
Floyd?

DON
This was the wackiest part of all, she’s
a big fan of the show - honest - bigger
than Ame - I couldn’t believe it either.
She whispers to me at the bar to wait a
minute and then follow her outside...

FLASHBACK - INT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL BALLROOM/BAR - NIGHT

In SILENCE we SEE Jessica Black whisper in Don’s ear, SAME AS
from the BEGINNING.
122.

BACK TO SCENE

DON
.-.- So I follow her. As soon as I get
out of the ballroom...

FLASHBACK - INT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL/OUTSIDE BALLROOM - NIGHT

In SILENCE we SEE the action take place that Don describes, but
the voice remains at Don’s house, as he CONTINUES in VOICE OVER.

DON DIDN’T (cont'd) (V.0.)
.+.-She grabs me and kisses me, then does
the chasing thing like a real sloppy
idiot - runs away from me hollering...

WE SEE her lips move, but the voice is Don’s.

DON (cont'd) (V.0.)
... “Chase me, Floyd! Chase me, Floyd!”
I didn't want to, but no matter how big a
tard she was, there was no way I was
passing on fucking Jessica Black. So she
drags me into the coat room and proceeds,
takes off her panties, shoves ‘em in my
pocket, “Hold these”, she says - that
reminds me, I want those panties back -
all the while going - get this...

Don and Jessica Black are in a heated embrace, she’s unzipping
his pants, etc. Her lips move and Don’s mouth forms the words in
unison, as Don continues.

DON (cont'd) (V.0O.) (cont'd)
... “Fuck me, Floyd! Fuck me, Floyd!” I
say, “May I speak? You can’t be serious,
you watch ‘Life’s A Gas'??!". “Love it,
never miss it”. “You’re an idiot”, I tell
her.

BACK TO SCENE

DON

... When we were through, she told me to
leave her there, she wanted to take a
nap. I said, “Get a room, we’re at a
hotel”, she said she does it all the
time, napped in every coat room in town.
So, I left. She didn’t ask for ‘em and I
forgot about her panties -- pretty
anticlimactic end to a story, huh?
123.

PETE
Yeah. If our lives were a movie, a
simple little movie about four New York
guys in L.A., this whole Jessica Black
murder thing would be something the
writer threw in to make the movie look
like it had a little plot, so all those
executives, who are afraid to depart from
conventional wisdom, would hopefully shut
up.

DON
Yeah - so, another day down. I mean,
that’s all it was, a day that amounted to
several days, but let’s call it a day.
We watched some TV, ate, talked - I, of
course, did not talk enough, you guys
talked way too much - just a day - and
this day happened to end okay. It could
have ended badly, but this day didn’t.
Tomorrow may -- so what do we got?
Pete’s had some rough moments lately, but
what was most important to him - to find
a bona fide nice girl, he has achieved.
I predict he’s married with kids by next
week. I avoided the electric chair,
always good news - and, much to my
amazement, have myself met a nice girl -
who comes with her own handcuffs, how
‘bout that for a bonus? Our dear friend
Al has suffered a very painful blow, but
is going to be just fine, because he has
loving friends who will be there for him.
And Ed, as always, is perfect in every
way, because nerds really do rule.
That’s it - more tomorrow - the end,
because that’s what days do.

SAME - LATER

Sue and Chris are outside with Lily. The guys are still in the
living room sitting together on the couch and easy chairs that
surround the coffee table. They have just killed the champagne,
they lean back, put their feet up, feel good.

Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head and SEE no change.
Ed, Al, Don and Pete doing exactly what they were doing, exactly
as they were before Don Flashed into his head. Then, suddenly,
bikini models, in bikinis appear from the kitchen, hallways,
behind the couch, etc., one for each of them. Each guy gets a
bikini model on his lap.

We SMASH CUT BACK TO SCENE. Don’s laughing to himself, he cracks
himself up. Again, Don closes his eyes, we FLASH into Don’s head
124.

were doing, exactly as they were before Don Flashed into his head
- no bikini models. Soon Sue, Chris, Lily and Mutt appear from
outside. Everyone piles on the couch and chairs. Dreyfus walks

through the door and joins them. One big happy family. Don
looks satisfied.

FADE OUT.

THE END
