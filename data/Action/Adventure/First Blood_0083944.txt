solitary figure of the kid on the highway shoulder,
walking TOWARD US. His jeens and Levi jacket are
faded; on the back is an American flag. He wears
paratrooper boots that he tucks his pants into. He
cerries 2 rolled-up sleeping bag over his shoulder --
just 2 mothing kid, like the freeks and burnouts one
ignores in Chicago or San Francisco. This, however,
is American heartland and we wonder if a kid looking
like RAMBO is being reckless about his choice of geog-
raphy. Reckless, too, that flat, umblinking, insolent
yet fareway expression in his eyes. INTERCUT with --

credible speed -- a blurring flesh of action.

An unseen crack (like snapping bone) drops Preston like
& s2ash-veight. He goes down as Mitch rises, gasping
from the kick to his balls. As he doubles up, 2 knee
to the face snaps him erect, end back on his heels,
smashing him into the wall. While Mitch is still
reeling back --

Rambo is already dealing with Galt, who is furiously
whipping the truncheon. So swift, so sure, so smooth
are Rambo's moves one would swear he previously choreo-
gréephed them in his mind. He evades two swipes and
catches Gelct's wrist midway through the third. He
primes it and lunges back against the grain, throwing
the big man ass over heels into a violent smack of

cell bars. Ward is eliminated from the brawl with *
equal alacrity.

the confidence of a disinherited son.

you out there. Let's wind this up.

We set world recorés for fire fights
and after five months in the bush, we
gotta week of R and R in Saigon... We
were going into this bar, and this kid,
carrying this shoeshine box runs up seying,
‘Shine, please, shine.‘ Joey said, 'Yeah'
and I went to get a couple of beers. The
shine box was wired - the kid opened the
bex and Joey changed shape - it blew their
bogies all over the bar!

RAMBO

(continuing)
There's blood ané pieces of him 211 over
me, I tried te holé him together, but
his insides kept slipping through my
hands. Joey screamed, ‘What about my
Chevy! I wanna drive my Chevy!' I said,
‘With what? I can't find your fuckin'
legs! He got cuiet and cGieé quiet. I
still cream abaut it. Listen man, I dream
this shit almost every night - sometimes I
wake up and don't know where the fuck I am.
I don't talk to anybody for hours ...deys
sometimes. I try to block it out of my
mind, but TI can't...
