BLACK SCREEN. A VACUUM OF SILENCE.

Then THE SOUND OF A RAGING SEA rolls from left to right
across the screen. The sweep of it BUILDS IN A
THREATENING RUSH... QUICKLY STARTING TO CRESCENDO as WE
SMASH CUT TO --

EXT. UNDERWATER - (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO) - DUSK

ret

Where THE CAMERA FINDS two pairs of feet kicking fiercely
from below.

EXT. OCEAN - (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO) - DUSK 2

Where TWO YOUNG CHINESE BROTHERS (PO AND HAN) fight for
their lives atop a jagged skyline of breaking whitecaps.
CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL...

The sea has never seemed more violent, dancing and
choking them from swell to swell. The makeshift raft
keeping them afloat nothing but a tattered basketball.

Yet they doggedly cling together, a shared dream and
their love for each other conspiring to keep them alive.

Welcome to the eight-hour escape from Mainland China to
the promise of a new life in Hong Kong.

TIGHTER

As Younger Brother (HAN) starts slipping away, losing his
tender grasp on the raft and survival. Older brother
(PO) sees this and makes a desperate lunge to help...

For a sickening moment Han is swallowed whole by the dark
water. Then Po ABRUPTLY HOISTS HIM BACK UP. As Older
Brother hugs him protectively to the meat of the raft...

YOUNG HAN
(CHINESE)
Where are the great lights?

YOUNG PO
(CHINESE)
Not far. Hong Kong will shine
bright as day, even at night.

A HELICOPTER SHOT drags us away from them.... PULLING
BACK TO REVEAL the hours of naked sea truly ahead... and

then WE MATCH cut TO --
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO BAY - OAKLAND SIDE - DUSK 2
Where THE SAME HELICOPTER SHOT sweeps in hard and low

over the water, now a lifetime away from our opening
vision...

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED: : 3

A BRIDGE looms across the water ahead... then A_DARK SUV
atop the bridge... AS WE COME IN TIGHT WE SEE...

FOUR ASIAN BAD-ASSES

Riding inside. The sheer mass of each man's muscle

threatening to shred the fabric of his Hugo Boss suit.

The CREDITS CONCLUDE...

EXT. STREETS - OAKLAND - DUSK 4

Where WE FOLLOW the same SUV making its way through the
descending darkness.

INT. DARK SUV - NIGHT 5

Where THE HYPNOTIC BEAT OF EASTERN-FLAVORED TRIP-HOP
courses through the cabin. WE WATCH the same four men as
they start feeding their machines.

-- Are withdrawn. We're looking at the Fortune
500 of firearms -- S&W .40's, Sig-Sauer .380's, even a
pair of MP-5's for safe measure... :

FRESH CLIPS -- Are THUMBED for empties and JAMMED into
the grips...
LEAD ROUNDS -- Are RACKED into waiting chambers...

ING P’ -- Are fitted for protection in case shit

turns loud. The cherry on top. Just because you may
have to put someone down doesn't mean you have to go deaf
doing it...

EXT. WATERFRONT CASINO - OAKLAND - NIGHT 6

A thriving gambling and dancing joint set amongst the
Oakland docks. Think of it as a little taste of Vegas
nestled inside the jaws of Hip-Hop. The Cops are paid
not to ask and the Brothers happy not to tell.

The SUV KNIFES into the loading zone, quickly joined by a
Porsche. Then STEADICAM FOLLOWS as HEAVY BLACK SHOES
exit and make an even march for the club...

INT. WATERFRONT CASINO - PLUSH BOOTH - NIGHT 7
Where PO SUNG (MID 30'S) drains off his third vodka
rocks. Looks very much the Asian-American playboy --

hair fucked up, Zegna suit and tie, tea shades
complementing a bone-handled cane.

(CONTINUFD)
 

CONTINUED: 7

Two ASIAN HOTTIES

DANCE SEDUCTIVELY before him. This is serious business
for his female companions -- working themselves into a
startlingly salacious coupling.

Po smiles lazily as the girl's tongues touch in a brief
flicker. Rotates the bone handle of his cane back to
reveal a small coke stash. Casually dips a nail and does
a bump.

WIDER SHOT

As WE REALIZE they're the only Asians in the place. A
ROOMFUL OF BLACK GAMBLERS AND OTHER DANCERS dagger them
with stares as THE SECURITY STAFF approaches.

The lead Bad-Ass wastes no time stepping up to the
Chinese...

BAD-ASS
Leave a twenty for the drinks and
crawl the fuck outta here.

The MUSIC DIES OFF, leaving a searing tension in its
wake. Po stares back with an almost infuriating
indifference.

PO
It's all good, Bra, no worries.
I'm simply waiting to talk to a
friend...

BAD-ASS
You don't have any friends in this
motherfucker. That's the problem.

Patrons TALKING SMACK fuel this from the safety of the
crowd ("Bye-bye you Chinese motherfucker" etc.). After a
beat...

PO
I'm no psychologist, but you seem
like a pretty angry guy.

BAD-ASS
You don't know the haif of it.

The table is JERKED OUT to extract Po when...
A CADRE OF CHINESE
aside. Pound for pound these guys are every bit as hard-

core as their counterparts. And you thought it was tense
before...

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED: (2) 7

Sung Family enforcer, KAI (LATE 20'S), walks the point.
This guy would have Van Damme crapping his pants inside a
minute -- his face reflects that. Sunglasses are canted
to reveal hard eyes and the bad attitude to go with ‘em.

KAL
Let it go, Po. This is a hassle
we don't need.

Po shrugs. Another lazy smile. But the Bad-Ass sticks a
hand into his chest keeping him from sliding out.

Po SWIFTLY STRIKES, -- the cane just a vague blur as it
CHOPS the hand down, CRACKS ribs on both sides, then
BUTTS the guy flush on the temple with the bone handle.

Kai shoots hima “What the fuck's wrong with you" look as
the man drops...

KAI
(to his men)

Get him outside.

A second bad-ass confronts the enforcer as Po is hustled
out...

BAD-ASS #2
Take his place, you'll take his
ass-whipping as well.

KAI
(lowers his sunglasses)
Bring whatever you've got.

The young black takes him up on it -- but Kai SNAP-KICKS
the guy's knee so quickly that his foot is back on the
ground by the time WE HEAR the ACL SNAP,... The enforcer
BOXES HIS EARS on the way down with a DEAFENING CLAP.

Kai calmly breast-pockets his shades. Then in the blink
of an eye it's on...

FULL VIEW - THE BATTLE

As A BRUTAL MELEE ERUPTS across the casino. We're
treated to a perfect blending of Martial Arts and Street,
EXTREME HAND-TO-HAND STUFF showcasing the better elements
of both...

One of the blacks CLOTHESLINES a Chinese throat... Two
others TRADE OPEN SHOTS Hagler/Hearns-style until one
simply drops...

Kai leads the pack, racking ass at a furious pace. He
TOSSES one guy through A GLASS PARTITION, then puts the
wood to SEVERAL BROTHERS emerging from the crowd to lend
a hand...

(CONTINUED)
 

CONTINUED: (3) 7 7

But one bad apple spoils the fun. A Chinese is the first
to go for his piece. Now a really nice moment as A DAISY
CHAIN OF HANDGUNS ARE DRAWN SIMULTANEOUSLY, dropping into
place like a row of dominos...

Black gun jammed to Chinese temple -- an Asian .45 stuck
in black's belly -- Mr. 45's spine scissored by a pair of
-380's, and so on...

A long beat. Both sides teetering on the brink of
annihilation. Then THE SOUND OF A SHOTGUN BEING RACKED
rolls over the house P.A...

SILK

tands next to e@_ microphon din weapon. He's
the owner and sole proprietor of this casino, and his AK-
47 TOTING BODYGUARDS now cover the room.

SILK
Guns don't kill people -- people
kill people.

He steps from the open DJ booth and starts down the
stairs...

SILK (cont'd)
Now if you'll excuse me,

gentlemen, you're disrupting my

business.
Slowly, the weapons are lowered.
SILK (cont'd)
So if your ass isn't black, you
best drag it out my establishment.
Bad-Ass #2 hobbles upright to confront Kai.
BAD-ASS

(cold, lethal)
This shit is far from over.

KAI
Fine -- we'll do it again once you
start walking.
The Chinese gather themselves for the exits...
EXT. WATERFRONT CASINO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 8
Where Kai has Po pinned up against his Lexus...

Whatever. I'ma big boy now...

KAT

anywhere like here -- ever.

sharply slaps his comrade's hands away and shoves him
ack...

PO
You work for me, Kai...

KAI
For your father...

PO
One and the same. You don't give
orders -- you take them.

KAI

Get your mind right, Po. As long
as there's a war going on you're
my responsibility.

WIDER ANGLE

As Po throws his cane into the backseat of his black-on-

black Austin-Martin. Climbs in and ABRUPTLY GUNS past an
arriving car to vanish into the night.

The arriving driver gets out to watch the others
disperse. This is our first glimpse of COLIN O'DAY
(BLACK, EARLY 20'S). A late young man wondering what it
is he's just missed...

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - OAKLAND - DAWN 9

Where an African-American PAPERBOY bikes down a placid
street, -half-asleep as he delivers the morning edition.

WE WATCH HIM nail a run of doorsteps with uncanny
accuracy. Then something makes him hammer the brakes.

WE FOLLOW his eyes upward as the little face flashes with
horror...

THE DEAD BODY OF PO SUNG

Hangs lynched from a streetlight. The corpse has taken a
ghastly beating, face distorted almost past the point of
recognition.

Off the paperboy's HAIR-RAISING SCREAM we...
HARD CUT TO:
INT. CH'U SUNG'S MANSION - STUDY - MORNING 10

Where Syndicate Overlord CH'U SUNG (60'S) channel-surfs
the MORNING SHOWS while chain-smoking his beloved
Marlboro Reds. He looks to be a jocular man, outwardly
sweetened by his advanced age and success, occasionally
LAUGHING at the t.v...

His EVEN OLDER MAID finally drags away the lavish
breakfast tray he's ignored...

MAID
(scolding in CHINESE)
Those filthy things are no kind of
breakfast. Not good for you. You
must eat something.

CH'U
(perfect English)
Life's not good for you, you old
hen. It has a horrible prognosis
and always ends in death.

She leaves in a pout, A THROATY CHUCKLE escaping his
lips. Within seconds DOORS BANG OPEN in the house...

MAID
(calling out)
INT. CH'U SUNG'S MANSION - MORNING tll

WE GET OUR FIRST GOOD LOOK at his palatial estate as Ch'u
hurries into the hall...

If you were expecting dragon statues, gilding and red
carpets you're out of luck -- this ain't no Szechwan take-
out joint. Everything is decidedly Californian, making
the point that Sung is glad to have come to America and
shared in her riches...

LONG SHOT - THE FOYER

WE DON'T HEAR THE WORDS he whispers in the old man's
ears. But something seems to die ete Ch'u then, face
withering with unthinkable anger.

TIGHTER - CH'U

Slowly turning away. He stares out the window oe
unseeing eyes. The ee of his swimming pool rippling
gently in the breeze.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS INTO the pool until it FILLS THE

SCREEN and then WE MATCH CUT TO...
EXT. ISAAK O'DAY'S HOUSE - MORNING 12

-Another swimming pool, perfectly mirroring the first.
As WE BEGIN TO TRACK BACK OUT a lone golf ball SPLASHES
the surface. A beat. A second ball follows...

FAVORING - ISAAK O'DAY (LATE 30'S)

As he SHANKS yet a third shot froma chipping green. The
self-made crime lord HEAVES his five-iron into the
landscaping and cinches the sash of his Armani pajamas...

ISAAK
Fuck Tiger. I hate this game.

Then WE HEAR A PHONE RINGING inside the house...
INT. ISAAK O'DAY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN 13

Where the phone waits on the counter. Isaak puts it to
his ear, idly opening the refrigerator door...

ISAAK
(talking into phone)
What do you have to tell me?

He slips a half-gallon of milk from the ice box,
dribbling some onto his chest as he takes a hit straight
out the carton.

t's a small thing, but very revealing -- the street
manners of the man abruptly peaking through to the
surface...

ISAAK (cont'd)
(suddenly attentive)
Sung's boy? Is that so? Who did

it?

Damned straight you better put it
together.

ISAAK
This might mess things up.

EXT. HONG KONG - AERIAL SHOT - ESTABLISHING i4

As WE GLIDE OVER the TEEMING METROPOLIS.. Her bright face
of glass and steel confidently poised on the brink of the
New Millennium...

EXT. HSING-KANG PRISON - DAY 15

An ancient stockade in the bowels of the city. This
place is so fierce it makes Quentin seem like Musso &
Frank's.

WE FOLLOW a police van as it passes through the gates.
SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS watching from above as MANACLED NEW
PRISONERS are directed inside...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - MESS HALL - DAYS LATER 16

Where SILENT INMATES pass along the meal line. A dollop
of rancid stew is their only reward.

The Head Guard KICKS one man's tray loose and forces him
to the ground. SAVAGELY CANES HIM.

HEAD GUARD
(MANDARIN)
NO TALKING...

PRISONER HAN SUNG

Watches this from the eating benches. We're immediately
struck by his dignified carriage, unbowed by captivity.
Face as self-~possessed and patient as the young McQueen.

ONE OF THE NEW PRISONERS approaches him.

NEW PRISONER
(MANDARIN)
You are Han Sung?

Han gives him a piercing once-over before nodding. The
New Prisoner takes a seat beside him.

NEW PRISONER (cont'd)
(MANDARIN)
I have word of your family.

The bad news is relayed quietly. Han's devastation is

that of Ch'u squared. He tries to speak, but finds his
throat mute...

WHAACK! The rattan cane BITES INTO Han's cheek without
warning. The Head Guard now smirking over him...

HEAD GUARD
(MANDARIN)
Stay quiet, Officer Sung. Your
stupid words ruin a golden
silence.

Han matches his glare. Thinks. Then HAMMERS his tray of
steaming crap into the bastard's face. Cheekbones CRACK,
nose EXPLODES. The cane is snatched up and WHIPLASHED IN
A BLUR across the man's head and chest...

A RUSH OF GUARDS descend. He TAKES A FEW OUT before they
DOG-PILE his ass to the ground...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAY a

Where Han -~- apparently unconscious -- is DRAGGED down a
concrete tunnel by FOUR GUARDS IN RIOT GEAR.

His eyes flicker just as WE ENTER...
INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - BEATING ROOM 18

No Amnesty International stickers here -- this is the
place where prisoners go to die. The Riot Squad drags
Han in, shellacking him with BATONS to the gut...

Two guards prop him up as a long-chained shackle is
clamped to his left ankle. The other cuff is to be
thrown over the ceiling beam to hoist him for a good,
long beating...

Evidently Han has other plans.

His leg ROCKETS from the six to twelve position to K.O.
the man closest. He JERKS THE CHAIN FREE from Number Two
then.whips it back out, COILING IT around the guy's
neck...

Two steps, THREE KICKS and a pair of busted face shields

later Numbers Three and Four meet a similar demise. Then

Han starts digging for keys...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - OUTSIDE THE BEATING ROOM 19
Where A GUARD stands post before the door. A KNOCK FROM

Han steps out dressed like a quard. Takes the fallen
man's keys and speeds off...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - ANOTHER CORRIDOR 20

Where Han searches frantically for a way out. Finally he
comes upon...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - CASH ROOM 2L

Where A FLEA-BITTEN JANITOR waits there for the Teller to
cash his puny payroll check.

Han passes through, those £f. a. sh. do’ ash
leering back from the cage. Janitor catches Han staring.
They share a look. Smile.

The ALARM KLAXON ERUPTS SUDDENLY. The Teller grabs the *
HOUSE PHONE to receive orders. Takes a baton and
THUNDERS OUT for the main prison.

A second shared look. Han's hand DARTS OUT to halt the
cage door inches from closing. Two more smiles.

Han passes an obese stack of currency through to the man
-- then takes one for himself and makes for the exits...

The janitor thinks. Scoops up his paycheck as well.
EXT. HSING-KANG PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY 22

Where the gates are CLOSED AND LOCKED. MORE GUARDS
arrive and race inside...

INT. HSING-KANG PRISON - VARIOUS CORRIDORS - DAY 23

Where the HATCH OPENS and Han finds the two helicopters.

The first TAKES TO THE AIR. Han runs to the second and

jumps onto the skids as it LIFTS OFF as well...

The guards SWARM OUT OF THE HATCH seconds behind as Han

is flown to freedom.

EXT. BARBERSHOP - OAKLAND - MORNING 33

An old-school nsighborhood fixture. Some fifty years of
doing good business with no signs of letting up. WE
WATCH the striped barber's pole spiraling proudly over
the entrance.

THREE BLACK BARBERS share gossip and shoot the breeze
with BLACK CUSTOMERS inside.

A FLOTILLA OF CHOPPED NISSANS

Saunter the boulevard towards them. Tinted windows
obscure the occupants and EASTERN-FLAVORED TRIP-HOP
whispers seductively from inside.

INT. BARBERSHOP - MORNING 34

Where one of the barbers looks up to find the gayntlet of
cars now fanned across the street, facing the shop.

BARBER
What in Hell...

A_TORRENT OF MACHINE GUN FIRE broadsides the roon. The
mobile hit-squad BEGINS LACERATING the men and the
building without mercy.

A Molotov is lit and thrown inside. Quickly SWEEPING THE
SHOP UP IN FLAMES...

INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - DAY 35

Where WE FOLLOW Isaak and MAC -- an ambitious young
lieutenant climbing the O'Day corporate ladder -- across
the terminal. SEVERAL BLACK ASSOCIATES of Isaak's on
their heels.

The entourage passes cleanly through the metal detector --
except for Mac.

Tense moment here as we wonder what he's packing. Then
two pagers and a cellphone later he's allowed in.

ONE OF THE GATES

Where Ch'u and Kai await with SEVERAL OTHER CHINESE
OVERLORDS. DECENT FAMILIES ON VACATION clutter the
background as Isaak arrives.

ISAAK
I had absolutely nothing to do
with it.
TIGHTER TWO SHOT - CH'U AND ISAAK

Framed by planes TOUCHING DOWN OUTSIDE on the tarmac...

ISAAK
Stuff like this is senseless for
everyone -- it doesn't pay. If it

was someone on my side, I'd flay
his ass and have it messengered
over. I've got kids myself, you

know,

CH'U

My son is dead -- that's what I
know.

ISAAK
You have my condolences, of
course...

CH'U
Of course...

ISAAK

wasn't me. Believe it or don't,
that's your business.

CH'U

rarely enters into the equation.

I've already called Maurice and
told him to shadow Trish. Didn't
want to take any chances.

Brains like that will keep you
high atop the payroll. You know
how his people are, even if she is
a civilian...

MAC
Oh, yeah. Those motherfuckers
make everything personal --
whether they right or not.

INT. "SERPENTINE FIRE" - MORNING 38

Where we find the sparkling TRISH O'DAY (20's). Clothing
from the '70's, stacks of old-school wax, her shop
retails the whole retro trip. It's a hot-spot for
neighborhood kids -- Black, White, Chinese, whatever. A
cultural DMZ.

A GROUP OF THEM peer inside the display case like cats at
a caged bird.

TRISH
Lori... Will you please give these
little monsters their funk fix?

As co-worker LORI (20) comes out to the case. She
unsleeves The Meters' rare and exceedingly funky
Rejuvenation. "People Say" leaps on the platter.

DRIVER waiting outside. Mo is one of Isaak's lower-level
street thugs -- a Wanna-Be headed straight for Never-Was.

MAURICE

Serpentine Fire. Smooth, huh?
Kool and the Gang jam from back in

MAURICE

brother's place.

CAB DRIVER
What's the story, pal? Can't read-

After a frantic game of chicken with on-coming cars he
gets it and drops into the right-hand lane. Different
country, different customs.

TRISH
Where exactly you from..

. -Ahkbar?

HAN
Hong Kong.

TRISH
You wanna start the meter?

He studies the complex contraption mounted on the dash.

Blindly pushes a button. Ooops. A roll ecei:
SPILLS onto the floor until he can finally STOP IT.

HAN
Forgot. It’s broken.

She studies him in the rearview for a moment.

TRISH
You steal a lot of cabs in Hong
Kong?

HAN

Only when I can't find a bicycle.
Do you want me to pull over?

TRISH
(gauges him, shakes her
head)
That's alright.
(after a beat)
So is it true what they say oes
Hong Kong?

HAN
What's that?

TRISH
That everyone there knows Kung Fu?

HAN
(amused)
Of course. State law.
TRISH
Even the women?

HAN
Especially the women.

Trish checks to see if he's putting her on. LAUGHS
WARMLY when she catches sight of his smile.

TRISH
Can you break a board with your
head?

HAN
Sure.

TRISH
A cinder block?

BAN
Uh huh.

TRISH
How 'beut a horse?

HAN
Easily.

TRISH

I'd have to see that, Ahkbar. You
must be a very dangerous man.
(looks out the window)
This is good. You can drop me off
at the corner.

What was your name?

TRISH
You think I want you calling me?

HAN
I don't have a phone.

TRISH
(killer smile)
There's a dead giveaway...

He watches her swing onto the sidewalk.
EXT. PRIVATE GOLF COURSE - OAKLAND - DAY 55

Where Isaak and real-estate magnate IVAN ROTH (40's) walk
the back nine. A cart follows carrying Mac and Roth's
WHITE ATTORNEY.

Roth lives wrapped in Teflon, a Big Money Boy hovering
perpetually above the law. Would have hijacked a few
S&L's back in the 80's if only he'd been old enough.

ROTH
How's the acquisition of my new
property coming?

ISAAK
Slowly. Some people just hate
parting with their land. They've
needed some... convincing.

They stop at the next hole. Isaak plants his tee first.

ROTH
I make the presentation tomorrow.
It's non-negotiable.

ISAAK
Yeah, well, I've had a lot of free-
thinkers to deal with.

Isaak takes a Mo Vaughn-sized cut -- trying to overpower

the ball with muscle alone. A huge divot is TORN FREE
and the ball SLICES into the rough...

ROTH

Isaak, my new friend. You're

that sense, it's much like the
rest of life.

Roth comfortably slips into his stance...

ROTH (cont'd)
The key is helping the body work
together

Forearm straight, wrists locked,
hands firmly on the grip.

(pulls into backswing)
That way the club is allowed to do
ea work. Eyes never leaving the
all...

 

Roth PERFECTLY DRIVES his bali down the fairway.
Admiring it as it drops nicely on the green.

ISAAK
(mutters)
These graphite shafts don't do it
for me.
ROTH

Save the excuses. Some heavy

investors are leaning on me, big

men that won't tolerate a wait.
(deep freeze)

It's a simple equation -- no land,
no... Dave, what's the popular
term these days?
ATTORNEY
(brightly)

Cheddar.
WE NOTICE Mac shoot this crazy white boy a look...

ROTH
That's right. No cheddar. AmI
making myself clear?

I knew you'd understand.

Lori's face...

LORI
Colin's in the back.

A disappointed beat. Trish moves for the storeroom,
parting the set of tie-dyed curtains to discover Colin
mid-conversation on the office phone.

He's Trish's little brother, Isaak‘s son. The same guy
we saw earlier at the Casino.

COLIN
You know that Chinese cat got
whacked?
INTERCUT WITH - EXT. PRIVATE GOLF COURSE - CLUBHOUSE 58
ISAAK

You mean Po Sung?

COLIN
Po somethin' or other. Anyway,
that's what I wanna tell you...

(lower now)
I got a call from him that night.
No bullshit -- same night he got
killed.
ISAAK

Jesus, boy -- What did he want?

COLIN
That's what I can't figure, Dad.
Never got a chance to meet him...

ISAAK
Mac better hear this. See if we
can figure out what it's all
about...

Colin looks up to find Trish. Abruptly...
COLIN
Gotta go, Dad. Call me back at my
place.
He HANGS UP. Big sister's face is not happy.

I asked you not to do your
business here.

life.

COLIN
(shrugs)
He's our father. You can't spend
the rest of your life just
pretending he ain't.

TRISH

He's also a gangster. Drugs,
strong-arm stuff...

(then, softer)
The same kids that come to my
store get lost because of guys
like him, waste themselves before
they really even grow up...

(a beat)
Why do you think I even opened
this place? I wanted them to see
a different way than that. A
better way.

Colin takes up his jacket and stands across from her.
COLIN

What if he got murdered ‘cause I

knew something and didn't tell?

Huh? Or thrown back in?

(determined)

Right or wrong it's all about

family. Qur family.
She watches as the curtains close behind him.
EXT. PO'S BUILDING ~ DAY 59

Where Han drives up. Checks the address against Po's
crumpled letter.

INT. PO'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 60

Where Han finds his Brother's place. He takes out a_hand-
i i ill and SLOTS THE LOCK...

25.

INT. PO'S APARTMENT - ATMOSPHERIC - DAY 61

Where Han at last enters his lost brother's world. He
drifts in with the reverence of a churchgoer, drinking in
the silent statements of Po's home and belongings.

DESK DRAWERS

Han expertly searches them, finding little more than old
letters and checkbook stubs, the meaningless remnants of
our too brief lives.

INSIDE THE CLOSET

Where he works through Po's extensive wardrobe. Digging

through jacket pockets, then slacks, shaking out pair
after pair of expensive shoes.

A tattered basketball finds him from the very top shelf.
An emotional moment as he eases it down -- Po must have

kept it here as a reminder of that defining day on the
ocean, and the strength of will it took them to survive.

IN THE BATHROOM

Where Han rifles the medicine cabinet. Systematically
dumping prescription bottles into the sink, then rooting
through the rainbow of pills looking for something,
anything that can help hin.

No luck. He goes to work on the shaving kit.
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS

Ride along the living room wall. Various images covering
the spectrum of the dead man's experience -- hanging out
with hotties at Fisherman's Wharf, leaning against a car
with a hot blonde tucked under each arm...

Qne picture in particular monopolizes Han's attention.
It shows Han and Po hugging tightly from the brink of
adulthood -- Han wearing his police cadet uniform, Po a
stylish jacket for Hong Kong of the time.

The sadness of his loss cuts deep here. Han sets the
picture down, face a quiltwork of difficult emotion.
Then his policeman's eyes cheat to...

THE PHONE

A fancy Caller I.D. unit. He ZEROES IN ON the "Redial"
button. Pushes it. A number appears across the large
digital display.

As he lifts the receiver to his ear...

WE HOLD ON HIS REACTION as he HANGS UP.
INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT - EVENING 62

Where Trish is staring into her lonely dinner, Maurice
and partner watching her from the front entrance.

The door OPENS AND CLOSES. She looks up to finda
smiling Mac beside her...

MAC
What's good here?

TRISH
(not interested)
Try the parking lot.

He lets it slide off, pulling out a chair to sit down.

MAC

I'm doing my job, girl. Just like
Mo...

{off her reaction)
Yeah, he told me about the shit
you pulled yesterday. Plain
stupid is what it was. Things are
real tense since that Chinese dude

got popped.
TRISH
Was that one of your jobs too?
MAC
That's not my style.
TRISH
Don't tell me -- I've got you all
wrong.
MAC

You don't have a clue what I'm
about. For starters, you've got
to get past the facade.

TRISH 7
You've got some serious facade
going on.

MAC

So do you, so does everybody.

You're an errand boy for my

MAC
Fair enough. But time comes when

TRISH
You've sold me, Mac, I just

with you...

MAC
(bristling)
Trash-talk me all you like.
Sooner or later this man here is
gonna be too much for you. You'll
start getting all misty eyed,
wishing there were two of me.

She pushes her plate across the table.

TRISH
Don't bother with the menu -- you
can have mine. Suddenly I've lost
my appetite.

Mac GRABS her arm as she gets up...
MAC
No more running wild. You gonna
do like Isaak wants and let us

EXT. "SERPENTINE FIRE" - LATER - EVENING 63

Where A TELEPHOTO SHOT finds Trish locking up. She head-
checks the street and starts off. WE QUICKLY RACK FOCUS
TO FIND...

A HIRED TAXI

PEEKING OUT OF an alley across the street. Han watches
from inside. Face slack with amazement at the owner's
identity.

DRIVER
Same thing?

HAN
Yeah. Keep following.
A beat. They ease on down the block...
EXT. TRISH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - BACK STAIRWAY - EVENING 64

groceries.

Where Trish enters to set the bags on the eee she
turns to lock up and finds t. th

It gives her a helluva scare but somehow she contains it
shy of crying out.

TRISH
Hello, Ahkbar. You're the only
guy I know working his way down
the criminal ladder. First Grand
Theft Auto, now trespassing.

He crosses to lay a piece of paper before her...

HAN
This is the last number my brother
called before he died.

It's the number for your shop.

TRISH
Yeah, so? I don't even know who
your brother is.

HAN
His name was Po Sung.

TRISH
I have absolutely no idea what
you're talking about. Why would
he want to talk to me?

Han's unwavering gaze scours her face, debating the
truthfulness of this.

HAN
He called.

TRISH
(shrugs)
I have a girl who works the
register. Maybe it was her. Once
in a while my little...

Then the name starts to register from her earlier talk
with Colin. As the possibility hits her...

TRISH (cont'd)
... brother.

HAN
Brother?

TRISH
Colin. He makes calls from there
sometimes. Mostly when I'm not
around.

HAN
We should talk to him. Have him
fill in the blanks.

Then THE HYPNOTIC GRIND OF HIP-HOP interrupts them as a
car PULLS IN...

CREW bounding out for the stairwell...

and waving his two dollar “tip".

HAN

Dim sum good. Call again. Dim

MAURICE

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why you

TWO OTHERS BELOW move to cut off the stairwell.

HAN

Let it go.
MAURICE

Isaak O'Day don't let things go.

He doesn't like the wrong element
around his daughter. My business
is to insure they ain't.

Han eases into fighting stance as they close the gap. A
LOW WHISTLE from Maurice. Then he proudly shows-off HIS
OWN VARIETY OF HALF-ASSED KARATE MOVES...

MAURICE
You ain't the only one knows some
shit.

Half beat. Han drills him with A STRAIGHT RIGHT.
Maurice's two front teeth pop out like a pair of
Chicklets. Now it's a sitting eight-count for him as
Dogs from above and below RUSH IN WITH BATS.

A THIRTY SECOND CLINIC IN HAVING YOUR BUTT KICKED FOLLOWS

stairs...
EXT. TRISH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ALLEYWAY - EVENING 69

Where Han enters a narrow corridor of chain-link between
buildings.

A FANCY SUV

SUDDENLY SQUEALS UP and TWO MORE DOGS hop the fence to
get at the Chinese.

ANOTHER FIGHT Neues (PER CURRENT CHOREOGRAPHY) where Han
uses the assembled attackers’ own belts and clothing to

defeat them. Ultimately, Maurice is left hanging by his
jacket from the chain-link fence.

INT. CH'U SUNG'S MANSION - TERRACE - DAY 71

Where Ch'u is surrounded by THE OTHER FIVE TONG
OVERLORDS. Heavy, heavy mojo here. Ancient politics
running centuries deep...

OVERLORD #1
The Honorable Lao-Tzu was lost to
assassination less than a month
ago. A grocer”s shop was
firebombed, his wife killed...

OVERLORD #2
With all respect, Ch'u, more must
be done about the blacks. They
have no honor. Any of us could be
killed at any time, Overlord or
mot...

A STRONG MURMUR OF AGREEMENT.

CH'U
None of this is news to me the day
I bury my own son.

His quiet gravity HUSHES the room...

CH'U (cont'd)
Who among you hurts as much as I?
But we must have the patience to
wait until the mud settles and the
water is clear.

OVERLORD #2
But any of the Overlords could be
wiped out, driving the families
apart..

Such things are protected against

(nods and grunts

acknowledge this)
This is the case should any of us
meet with misfortune. By treaty,
our territory stays within the
Collective.

We are not the blacks, Victor.
Our loyalty to each other is
unquestioned.

OVERLORD #3
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

CH'U

EXT. CHINESE GARDENS - VIEWING ROOM - DAY 72

Where the viewing of Po's body is taking place.
Everything is done very traditionally -- ANCIENT FUNERAL
DIRGE, paper money being burned to calm wrathful
spirits...

THRONGS OF CHINESE pass by the open coffin. Ch'u and Kai
watch them from a mourning platform on high.

EXT. CHINESE GARDENS - MAIN GROUNDS - DAY 73
Where Han appears on a distant bridqe above the glassy

waters of the pond.
EXT. CHINESE GARDENS - VIEWING ROOM - DAY 74

Where the viewing continues. Then it's Han's turn to
step through the shroud of incense to reach the corpse.
He stares long and hard at the waxy certainty of his
Brother's death.

He takes the tattered basketball and tucks it into the
coffin. A telling final farewell.

Then Han looks up sharply to lock eyes with Ch'u. His

father's brow briefly furrows with surprise, but neither

face betrays what either man feels inside...

Where Han and his father are now locked in
conversation...

Stop punishing me for your
choices. You wear this dammed
sanctity like a badge...

HAN
(MANDARIN)
I have never regretted what I did
for Po.

CH'U

(MANDARIN)
Nor should you. You were a
policeman who allowed his brother
to escape a State Death in Hong
Kong. The Family found great
honor there, even though you were
never proud of this...

HAN
(MANDARIN)
Not proud, no.

CH'U
(MANDARIN, shrugs)
There is God's Law and man's law.
You've always well understood the
difference between them.

HAN
(MANDARIN) 5
Which law told you to abandon your
sons on the Mainland? To flee

wears a different face.

ia EXT. KAI'S ROOFTOP - DAY wi

Where Kai is practicing a kata -- running through a
pattern of prescribed movements against imagined
attackers. His sunglasses flaring brightly in the
afternoon sun.

Han watches this from a distance. Kai finishes his
routine and joins him...

KAI
The old man didn't think you'd
make it, Han Sung.

HAN

Despite the hard exterior, Kai can see Han struggling

HAN
Why there?

KALI
Wouldn't tell me. But that makes
no difference now...

HAN
These blacks. Why war with them?

THEIR POV - WATERFRONT DISTRICT

Where a panoramic view of the waterfront rolls out behind
them. A thick blanket of homes and buildings run the

flatlands to the Bay.

KAI (cont'd)

It's only two square miles, the
waterfront.

They control west of the line --
everything east is ours. By
muscling Chinese they hope to take
what belongs to us.

HAN

Only so many rats in a cage before
they start tearing each other

opposite Han. Han grins at the invitation and quickly
enjoins him in A FRIENDLY EXCHANGE...

WE FOLLOW THEM across the roof -- THRUST... THRUST...

Where A FOOTBALL GAME is taking place. Mac, Maurice and
a bunch of the crew having it out five-on-four...

Trish sits across the grass eating lunch with SEVERAL
NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS. An ice cream truck arrives at the
park and she leads a few of them over...

AT THE TRUCK

Where Trish now tries to balance a half-dozen cones for
the kids. Han has materialized beside her in line as she
turns...

HAN
That's quite an appetite.

TRISH
Nice to see you again, too.

She looks out to the football game, distracted...

Second down. Han gets HAMSTRUNG cutting downfield...
somehow rights himself... then takes A MONSTER RONNIE
LOTT-STYLE HIT from two defenders as he goes up for the

SMAACCK! They dump him head-first into the tur€.
BACK IN THE HUDDLE
HAN
(stumbling back)
How come nobody else gets hit?
MAC
(smiling)
"Cause you the one with the ball,
brother.
Third down. Han takes the pill and bolts straight at
Maurice. The thug is about to lower the boom when Han
dd hh him the ball.

A stunned beat as he catches it. Then Han comes flying
in with A BONE-CRUSHING TACKLE. Regains the ball...

MAURICE
(in the aftermath)

I think he broke my arm.
DOWN THE FIELD
As the Chinese goes for it -- CREAMING one would-be
tackler after another. WE BRIEFLY FIND TRISH smiling her
ass off on the sidelines...
Han reaches the goal line. Stops and turns.

This halts the crippled stragglers giving chase dead in
their tracks. They back up.

Han enjoys this, smiles. Then steps across the goal
line.
BAN
Good game, this football.

He SUCCINCTLY SPIKES THE BALL. A beat. The awed
defenders watch as it LOUDLY DEFLATES.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 79

Where Colin and his GIRLFRIEND are making a nice dinner.
The scene here is surprisingly domestic -- Krups coffee
maker, sushi machine, the works...

His girl wears a bathrobe, Colin ranting around the room
in just sweatpants...

COLIN
It's like they don't think I can
handle my own business...

GIRLFRIEND
(on auto-pilot, heard it
all before)
Um hum.

COLIN
My father's got to realize I'm cut
from the same cloth. He's gotta
start respecting my manhood...

GIRLFRIEND
Um hum.

COLIN
Like that call I got. I try and
do the right thing, help hin

back...

The DOOR BUZZES. She wipes her hands on a towel...

GIRLFRIEND _
I'll get it. You watch this
stuff.

COLIN

When is it gonna be my turn to get

EXT. BAY - FURTHER OUT - DAWN 82
Where Colin's body is being dredged from the same waters.

WE PULL BACK to see the POLICE DIVERS and WINCH

boats circled around them.

The corpse is eased onto a deck. That boat then GUNNING

NEW ANGLE - TRISH AND ISAAK

Moving together as Colin's corpse is finally set down to
be covered by the paramedics...

- ISAAK
Don't say anything to the police,
I'll handle that.

His daughter finds herself simply overcome by grief...

TRISH
I never wanted him mixed up in
your dealings. I told him that
just as many times as I told

ISAAK

You think I'm not dying right now?
Inside? Believe me girl -- ian.
You two are ali I've ever had in

But this is a family concern -- I

sorrow)
He's my boy and I'll take care of

You had a hand in this, Isaak,

You might as well have thrown him

inconsolable regret.

ISAAK

You gotta keep it stitched up

Certain motherfuckers gonna got

Isaak lets this advice hang there. Starts a slow nod,
realizing his how right his lieutenant is.

ISAAK
Either way, Ch'u just bought
himself a one-way ticket to the
apocalypse.
INT. PO'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 84
Where Han arrives to some bad news.

The front door has been broken open. Looks like somebody
sledgehammered it, nearly rocking it off the hinges.

Han drifts through the wreckage of his brother's home.
E has been ransacked and turned inside-out.
Looking for what, Han has no idea.

He fights to suck it up now, as broken as the keepsake

siphon away his strength.

A long moment. Then his policeman's eyes notice...
THE OTHER PHOTOS

Still hanging crooked on the walls. He goes to them
immediately, taking down the one of Po with the blonde

astride his car. The make and model can't clearly be
made out from the picture.

That's what he's overlooked.
IN THE BEDROOM

Where Han's fo eae ferret through Po's discarded slacks
to find a ring of keys.

INT. PO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - GARAGE - AFTERNOON 85
Where Han faces a line of cars filling the garage.

But where to start? He thinks for a minute -- then
DEACTIVATES Po's alarm using the button on the key ring.

Its TELLTALE BLEETING singles out his brother's Austin-
Martin.

THE TRUNK

Han SPRINGS IT and searches. SLAMMING THE TRUNK LID when
he finishes...

THE INTERIOR

Where he EMPTIES the glove compartment and ashtray, FLIPS
DOWN the sun visors. During this entire sequence we
realize he's got the hands of any cop -- fast, thorough
and completely focused,

Then he ducks his head down to look under the seats...

PO'S CANE
Lays on the back seat floorboards. Having settled there

the night Po threw it inside.

Han reaches around to retrieve it. ROTATES the bone
handle of his brother's cane back to reveal the coke
Stash. His face flashes with disappointment -- not the
kind of shit he'd hoped to find.

The handle is then ROTATED BACK THE OTHER WAY. It
RELEASES as he takes it a notch too far, revealing...

Staring back from inside. He fishes it out and examines

Po's handwriting.

Han slowly looks them over, no apparent order or meaning
to the bunch.

INT. PO'S APARTMENT - DAY 86

Where Han now returns to his brother's apartment to find
Trish awaiting him on the couch. Her feet stir aimlessly
through the splintered carnage...

HAN
(concerned)
What is it? What's happened?

TRISH

(without lookin up)
Once Colin and I did something we
thought'd be really funny. He hid
out front while I ran to tell Mom
he'd been hurt, hit by a car or
something bad like that. When she
came running, Colin was supposed
to jump out and surprise her and
then we'd all have a good laugh.
My mother, she always loved a good
laugh...

(pauses)
I was only eight or nine, Colin
younger, and I don't even remember
how we came up with it. But sure
enough, I started yelling and she
rushed outside.

(softly)
And when I told her, I mean, the
look on her face... She was just

erushed, totally destroyed. She
collapsed right there in the yard,
weeping, broken...

(slow beat)
Even when Colin showed her it was
a joke she wouldn't stop. It had
shaken her too deeply. Even as
she clutched him there, safe and
sound, it was too much.

HAN

TRISH
Threw him right out his window.
Fifteen stories up...

HAN

No leads at all, no witnesses...

She shakes her head. Then...

TRISH
I want to help you, Han, I need

now...

ROTH

Gentlemen -- I just found out the

NFL officially approved our bid
about an hour ago.

(listens to the wash of

approval)
Tell the truth, Frank, I don't
think any of the other bids were
even in contention. We offered
prime time waterfront here,
seconds from the Bridge. God
Himself couldn't have designed a
more perfect place for a stadium.

That's right, Barry, you know me

The Chinese side of the line. THE CAMERA PANS ALONG a
desolate block of real estate -- homes abandoned, most of
the barren shops shuttered.

HAN'S FACE

Studies this in shadow from across the street, Trish at
his side. His questioning eyes work it over, playing
through the chessboard in his mind.

Several addresses are marked off Po's list, a few new
ones jotted down...

TRISH
I don't understand. They're just
Waterfront addresses.

HAN
Whatever they mean, Po didn't want
them found. Stashed them good
enough that they wouldn't be.

Plays alone on the sidewalk. The kid shades his eyes as

whole new world to her -- a part of the city she's never
experienced.

TRISH
Is Hong Kong like this?

HAN
No. More crowded.

TRISH
(testing the waters)
You were a policeman there?

HAN
Yes.

TRISH
Bet your family loved that.

HAN
It saved them from prison.

We raided a tanker muling drugs

to my brother and father.

TRISH
You warned them.

My father had already gone to
America -- the danger was really

TRISH

What did they give you?

You sure this is right?

TRISH (v.o.)
That's what the list says --
Forty-forty Driggs.

EXT. WRECKING YARD - MAIN GARAGE - AFTERNOON 94
Where the couple gets out. The yard is CONSPICUOUSLY
QUIET -- none of the cranes working, lifts and loaders
abandoned.
The office is locked. Han considers this. Moves to the
door. Takes the handle and starts it SLOWLY
GRINDING UPWARD...
LOOKING INSIDE

Pitch black at first, nothing clearly visible. Then
sunlight floods into the bay to reveal...

SIX MURDERED CHINESE WORKMEN

in 2 e@_ ov . Each wears a
tidy bullet hole through the forehead.

Trish steps back and starts to dry-heave.

Han lays a hand on Ho's throat. The body is stiil warm.

Looks down. A fumbled cigar STILL SMOULDERS on the

floor.

As it hits him, CAR ENGINES ERUPT OUTSIDE...

EXT. WRECKING YARD - AFTERNOON 96

O'Day could have contracted to

exactly this type of dissent.

HAN
Now you overestimate his power.

CH'U

Really? Maybe I should be more
concerned with his daughter's.

You're a fool if you don't think

Trish has had her fill of testosterone for one afternoon.
Gets up...

MAURICE
Girl, where you going?

TRISH
Upstairs for a nap. Maybe take a
shower.

MAURICE

and the screen)
Alright, then -- but don't get

Where Trish still hasn't heard anything. She steps back
into the corridor with a nervous glance.

INT. ISAAK O'DAY'S HOUSE - STUDY - LATE AFTERNOON 115

Where she slips inside her father's office, door gently
closing behind her.

She starts rifling the place -- his desk, shelves,
anyplace there might be something of importance. Inside
one of the file cabinets...

A HOST OF GRANT DEEDS

ownership. hey're i. i

She roams over them. Surprised to recognize an address.

TRISH

Forty-forty Driggs...
Then she realizes something else. T ‘x

She starts to take it when it hits her -- the deed will
be missed. In a near panic, she catches sight of the fax
machine waiting in the corner.

from the bathroom to make sure it's clear.

From the balcony, he wonders at getting them down. An
idea strikes him. He proudly turns to find Trish still

Han windmills into a Buster Keaton pirouette -- almost
knocking himself over trying not to see her.

EXT. ISAAK O'DAY'S HOUSE/EXT. TRISH'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOO22

Overlord #3 grants her a lascivious smile as he takes the

One of Kai's cadre enters to bows respectfully...

He's here.

Ch'u nods and leaves the house a clip of Chinese

gratitude and relief...

INT. TEA HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 126

Where STEADICAM FOLLOWS the Overlord and his escort

A DOZEN CHINESE ILLEGALS slave away over steaming and

large holding bins.

They sense Ch'u's presence but dare not look up.

copied deed, his brow wrinkling with concern...

TRISH
This was the only one that wasn't

I also noticed a deed for Victor
Ho's place.

Han takes out his list and cross-references the new
document against it.

HAN
This address matches the last
entry on Po's list. I already
checked the others -- they've
either been cleared out or sold.

TRISH
That's a helluva lot of property
changing hands. Hard to believe.

He holds out the deed so she can read it...

The ELDERLY CASHIER looks out at her with stony eyes.

TRISH
I want to see Silk.

Tell him Trish O'Day is here.

The woman disappears into the back without comment.

INT. WATERFRONT CASINO - BAR SIDE - NIGHT 132
Where Trish and Han now stand waiting.

She notices THE BEVY OF HOSTILE STARES coming from all
directions. This place is way too hot for any Chinese to

be making the scene right now -- especially Han.

To get out from under the magnifying glass, Trish drags
Han...

ON THE DANCE FLOOR

..,and starts them DANCING. She's fantastic, sliding
right into the sexy, urgent flow of the DJ's HOUSE MUSIC.
Han's gonna need a few lessons however, moving with all

Silk now going over Han's list...

SILK
And you're saying these places

HAN
(nodding)
Victor Ho's was the last. He-was
taken down this afternoon.

The owner's face is etched with a deep concern. Looks
directly to Trish...

SILK
You're absolutely sure about this,
girl?

TRISH

Yeah, Silk. Yours isn't the only

black property that was targeted.

All the others have been bought up
or burned out by now...

Silk pauses before shaking his head in approval.

He moves to OPEN the office door opposite...

TIGHT ON - MAC

Walking through, having listened in on the entire
exchange. The angle of his gun runs a plum-line straight

through Han's heart...

MAC
Damned if you haven't nearly put
it all together. Pretty
impressive for a guy barely speaks
the language.

TRISH
Let's talk to my father. See what
he says about it.

MAC
Fuck your father. Like I said --
time comes when a man has to stake
-his own claim.

SILK

Yo, Mac. You bring my money?

Mac takes the unsigned grant deed from his breast pocket
and passes it across. His eyes never leaving Han.

SILK

Right there?

MAC
Right there.

Silk takes up his pen and signs, finishing with a
flourish. Greedy hands rub together in anticipation...

SILK
You got yours, brother, now
where's mine?

Mac hefts a suitcase onto the counter and Silk jacks the
clasps. Six hundred thousand in bundled hundreds is
nestled inside.

Knowing that this offers their only chance at survival.
He STUTTER-STEPS FORWARD and PINS Mac's gun hand to the

Dead silence is a tragic understatement. Han and Trish
immediately find their escape cut off by THE MEAN-ASSED
CROWD. .

THREE BOUNCERS

Rush out to grab them. First mistake -- one makes a grab
for Han's shoulder. Han intercepts him and SEVERELY
TORQUES HIS WRIST. WINDMILLS him into a partner...

A third brings a high-voltage cattle-prod to the show.
He THRUSTS OUT. Han uses one fluid motion to strip him
of the prod and DRIVE IT back into his side...

SHARP HISS as peroxide meets wound. Trish empties a pack

MAURICE
Hear that, Dim Sum? Time go
nighty, night. :
(then, curious)
One thing I gotta know, bro -- you
didn't really think you was gonna
get them drawers?

HAN
(raspy, spitting out
blood)
What?

MAURICE
That ass, bro. Trish. You really
think she was gonna give it up to
YOu?

His posse chimes in with ADDITIONAL SMACK ("Damn dawg"
"Aw, shit" etc.). Han doesn't respond,

MAURICE (cont'd)

Didn't think so. Best you didn't
even try -- after Isaak turns over
the deeds at the Top 0O' The Fives,
Mac's giving himself a big
promotion.

(off Han's reaction)
Hell, yeah. Gonna dump O'Day into
the Bay and take Number One
Daughter and all that cash for
himself and his dogs...

Again Han fails to reply, his eyes flickering like that
of a beaten fighter.

MAURICE

All right, fellas, let's do this.
Young Romeo here's gotta die.

Whoa, Mo. You can't shoot him

MAURICE

And exactly why not?

CREW #1
Mac’1l flip if we stain the
carpets. This is gonna be his
office now...

: MAURICE
Yeah, dawg. You right.
(half beat)

Let's throw him out the window.

CREW #1
What about the glass?

MAURICE
(Lightbulb comes on)
We'll open it first...

And they do. Then they grab Han's limbs like four pall
bearers and get a running start -- 1
the 1 e win

SLOW MOTION - HAN
His body being pitched into open space. His left hand
SUDDENLY ROCKETS OUT to grab the sill... his right
Maurice's tie...
He hangs there but a millisecond. Maurice fighting to
brace himself against the inside...
HAN

You ain't the only one knows some

shit.
And with a YANK they both go spiraling out...
EXT. ISAAK O'DAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 150A
Where WE WATCH as Han and Maurice plummet for the

Pavement. The Chinese now pulls A SPECTACULAR MOVE --
spinning Mo underneath him in mid-air to use him as a
human_air bag

Han gets up and dusts himself off. Escapes with the
others still watching spellbound from above...

EXT. "TOP OF THE FIVES" RESTAURANT - NIGHT 151

Where Isaak stands outside the entrance as Mac and his
bad-asses arrive.

Strain is now apparent on the crimeboss' face for the
first time. He's allowed himself to envision a new life
for he and Trish -- and the price of it is an inevitable
vulnerability.

Mac is loving every minute of it. Silently pleased at
the prospect of his boss having slipped from his game
face.

ISAAK
Trish should already be here by
now.
(checking watch)
Mac -- are you positive they've
picked her up?

MAC
Isaak, man, you gotta relax. I
talked to Mo and the boys not ten
minutes ago. She's safe and she's
on the way.

INT. "TOP OF THE FIVES" RESTAURANT -~- NIGHT 152

Where Isaak and Mac enter. They see Ivan with his
attorney and join them at the table...

ROTH
Isaak, my new friend. At last we
conclude our business.
(shaking hands)
My deeds?

Mac passes a small valise across to him. Roth hands it
straight-away to his attorney.

ROTH
No offense, but I'd like David
here to review them. He's
particularly good with details.

ISAAK
(shrugs)
None taken. They're all there.

The attorney quickly thumbs the forms inside.

ROTH
Excellent spirits. I expect very
shortly you'll be in the same.

ATTORNEY
(finished)
Perfect. Everything's in order.
ROTH

How wonderful.

He motions for a_small briefcase to be brought for Isaak
-- it's identical to that given the Chinese earlier.

ROTH
And this belongs to you. Per our
agreement, I think you'll be very
pleased.

ISAAK
(spins it on him)
Do I need to have Gummy here
review it?

VIEW OF - GUMMY

One of the baddies -- baby dreads, wired eyes, jaws
maniacally pumping his chewing gum back and forth. The
absolute antithesis of Ivan's Ivy-League asshole.

ROTH
(touché)
No. It's all there.

Isaak draws the case to him anyway. A beat. Then he
shocks everyone by pushing it back unopened.

ISAAK

Keep your cheddar, Ivan. I'd
rather you invest it for me.

Nobody knows what to make of this -- Ivan and his
Attorney slack-jawed, Mac fit to have a major coronary...

ROTH
Isaak, I'm afraid I don't
understand...

ISAAK
It's easy. I'm going to be your
partner.

(lets it sink in)
I'm up to the task -- trust me.
Used to play a little bail myself.
And I do look fantastic inside a
luxury-box.

ROTH
(regains his composure)
I'm afraid I already have
partners, several in fact.

Isaak turns intimidating. The kind of power which
underscores his ascension from the wasteland of an
Oakland ghetto.

ISAAK
So add another one. The bid's
already been accepted. Without my
deeds you're a short hair from
ending up in a meat locker
yourself.

Long beat. Ivan fully realizing the bad spot he's in.
Then Mac can't take anymore...

MAC
Fuck the luxury box -- I'll take
the green.

Isaak finds a fire-breathing Sig-Sauer angled smack at
his belly. Mac scoops up the briefcase, intoxicated by
the lure of all that cash...

ISAAK
a 2 ing?
MAC
I believe they call it corporate
restructurin'. As of right now,

O'Day Enterprises is being

swallowed whole by Mac, Inc. I'm

taking your capital reserves...
(holds up the case)

And your most valued asset...

He signals his dogs and Trish is escorted inside.
MAC (cont'd)

And then I'm gonna leverage you
out.

Isaak makes a vicious lunge for him, fearless in his rage
at betrayal...

ISAAK
You shitt ttl loodsu ee

streets...

MAC
Yeah, sure -- but what have you

done for me lately?

Mac GUT-SHOOTS his.mentor, crumpling him to the floor.
His daughter rushes to his side.

TRISH

Mac could care less, HURRIEDLY SPRINGING THE CLASPS to
get to the good part...

MAC
Now let's see some shit.

There's nothing inside but a white envelope. He snatches
26 Up and rips J Open...

A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATE CHECK

Made out to "Q'DAY ENTERPRISES" confronts him. Mac about
craps himself...

MAC
A check? A MOTHERFUCKIN' CHECK?
I don't believe this...

Isaak's WOUNDED LAUGH mocks him from the floor.

ISAAK
Punk. Now look at your street

ass. Nobody's dealing in cash
these days.

MAC
(livid)
Better hope you stay alive long
enough to bank this
motherfucker...

TO BE WRITTEN: Han BURSTS IN and A FANTASTIC SHOOT-OUT
FOLLOWS between Roth's Bodyguards and the blacks. In all
the commotion, Roth runs to the roof where a helicopter
awaits. But Mac BLOWS HIM AWAY before he can escape...

Han takes out the remaining soldiers and then faces off
with Mac...

HAN
Two-man game now, Mac.

The young lieutenant leans back to rake his barrel across
the nape of Trish's neck...

MAC
You forgettin' about the broad,
Ahkbar. Baby makes three.

HAN
(dispassionate)
I want to know why you murdered my
brother.

MAC
Wasn't me. I killed Colin
alright, Isaak didn't know a thing
about it. Couldn't risk him
killin’ the deal.

HAN
(insistent)

What about Po?

MAC
You got your own people to thank
there. All that shit was handled
in-house.

Han feels his blood roiling, the depth of what this means
almost unfathomable.

MAC (cont'd)
Now get on your knees or I'll

smoke her.

HAN
Behind you.

MAC
If that ain't some tired
bullshit...

But Han’s gaze convinces the thug he's for real. Mac
turns slowly to find...

The SECOND ROUND finishes him...
WIDER ANGLE
As Han and Trish kneel to check Isaak's wound.

It's real bad, but he's hanging in. WE HOLD FOR A MOMENT
on the ex-gangster, his eyes now silently doing what his
seized throat cannot -- thanking Han for saving his
daughter and himself.

Han covers him with his jacket. Gently places a finger
to Trish's lips before leaving...

EXT. CH'U SUNG'S MANSION - GREENHOUSE - NIGHT 153

Where Han covers the glass pane over the door's deadbolt
and SOUNDLESSLY KNOCKS IT OUT.

INT. CH'U SUNG'S MANSION - GREENHOUSE - NIGHT 154

A lavish second floor housing bright Asian flora. Below
them, a pool of exotic fish consumes the entire ground
level.

Han enters the lush greenery. For a moment we're taken
aback, feeling as if we've awoken in the humid heart of
an Asian jungle. Han wanders in...

KAL

KAI
It was strangely exhilarating,
killing Po. Really gave me a
rush.

HAN ;
Why doesn’t that surprise me?

KAT
(with distaste) :
Your brother wasn't suited to
lead, Han Sung. He didn't have
the stomach for it, the necessary
balls.

HAN
You believed yourself a much
better choice.

KAI
Naturally.
(then)
Why don't we settle this properly?
NEW ANGLE
As again they take stances opposite each other -- their

former kinship replaced by an unbridled and unabashed
hatred.

This is the most scintillating moment in the entire
movie. A MARTIAL ARTS BATTLE ROYAL beginning only two
men of this caliber could create.

There is a vicious grace to the combat, their contrasting
styles well-suited. Kai the younger and more aggressive,
Han more patient and precise...

Han launches A HURRICANE OF KICKS, forcing his enemy
back. Kai responds with A COMBINATION OF PUNCHES,
hunting and pecking away to the body.

Then Han raises the ante. Grabbing Kai's neck and
unleashing A SERIES OF HEAD-TO-KNEES -- face forced down,
knee savagely coming up to tenderize it. Kai SPINS FREE
and SLAMS KICKS to Han's groin and solar plexus, sucking
the air out him. And so the war rages...

WIDE TWO SHOT - HAN AND KAI

Ultimately coming to a stand-still. Both hurt and
hemorrhaging from nose and mouth, each man now proven the
other's equal

KAI
The old man was afraid you might
win, Han Sung.

HAN
And you?
KAT
I knew you wouldn't.
The FIGHT CONTINUES (DETAILS BEING DISCUSSED) as Kai

appears to take the upper hand. Han then eee himself
to permanently extinguish his brother's killer.

(ED_NOTE: We need to find a great way to pay off Kai's
here which we've well established earlier in
the film.)

Then his youngest son Han Sung walks through the door.

HAN
(MANDARIN)
What is it like, Father?

He brings Kai's weapon up and trains it on the old man's
heart.

HAN (cont'd)
(MANDARIN)
To go on living with your own
son's death? Can you sleep? Can
you even eat without his face
finding you?

CH'U
Outwardly, Po was always the
stronger of you. But inside he
was always weak. Weak and sickly
with compassion for strangers,
outsiders. He put his own
interests -- their interests --
above those of the family.

HAN
(MANDARIN)
What family? There is only you
and your money. When has it ever
been any different?
(bitter laugh)
The Mainland? Hong Kong?

CH'U
What he knew would have ruined
things with Roth, would have
i us. I did everything I
could to scare him off...

HAN
Except the right thing. Except
what you knew was right.
(torn apart)
To take his side and be his
father.

Han stands teetering with an unendurable amount of rage.
Never has he wanted to kill with the hunger he does right
now.

CH'U
(unaffected)
What do you assume to do with me?
Have your vengeance? Will that
bring him back, Han?

HAN
No. I have honored my brother

The rest is for others, strangers.

Han RACKS A SINGLE ROUND into the chamber and SLIDES the
weapon's full clip into his pocket.

q 1 A in _butt-fi L

. HAN
If the police don't get you, the
other Chinese families will.

He slides it across. Giving the old man just one bullet
to do his bidding. One bullet for either himself or his
son...

HAN (cont'd)
Do what you will, Ch'u. But this
time no one will go to prison for
you.

It serves as their final good-bye. Han slowly turns and

the mercy of his murderous father.

Ch'u picks up the weapon... levels it Han's back...

HAN'S POV - LOOKING OUTSIDE

Where DISTANT SIRENS momentarily precede A PACK OF COP
CARS FISH-TAILING onto the street and SPEEDING for the
long stone driveway...

But still Han doesn‘t turn. Giving his father the
cleanest of shots at a motionless target.

Ch'u clinches the weapon with TREMBLING hands, finger
coiling around the trigger...

BLAAMM! THE GUN FIRES. Its WHITE FLASH BLINDING THE ROOM

The Chinese resembles a human train wreck at this point,
completely trashed by his long odyssey. But he alone
stands as sole survivor.

The couple cuts a path through the circus of law
enforcement, STAYING IN SLOW-MOTION, focused only on each
other...

TIGHT TWO SHOT - HAN AND TRISH

Where he scans her face before they touch -- the gentle
lilt tells him Isaak is going to be alright. Then they
come together in a long dreamed-of embrace...

Trish softly pulls free. Leans in to kiss him.

You know, it is a great country. He just might stay.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as Trish holds tightly to Han's
hand, the couple centered within the chaos. THEN BACK
