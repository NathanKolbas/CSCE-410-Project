THE WARRICRS

CLEON

The leader. President of the Warriors.
Tough, wiry, great street intelligence, .
charismatic. He has a tightly controlled
intensity...

THE Fox
Quick-witted, emotional, verbese, he is the
“memory man” known for his enormous knowledge
of other gangs within the city. His toughness
is as much of an attitude as physical aptitude
++-Fast of foot, a perfect scout on military
missions. Rembrandt's best friend.

SWAN
The War Chief. Laconic by nature. Very tough,
very resourceful...a natural military tactician.
He combines shrewdness and physical courage. By
choice a loner, he dislikes the necessity of
taking command...

REMBRANDT
The Marker or Artist. The shyest member of the
Warriors; small kinetic, somewhat reserved.
He can climb anywhere, move silently...The
youngest of the patrol...

COCEISE
A reugh and ready street boy who has a simple
approach to his existence, fight and fornicate
~--+A soldier and a good one.

COWBOY
Wears a Stetson. Lithe, quick, amiable, qoes
along with the crowd. Always smiles, A soldier
and a good one. ,

VERMIN
Raw~boned and tough. Not always a disciplined
soldier, he complains a lot before he bops,
but he's always there...

SNOWBALL

Tall, lean; the face and body of a Masai warrior
---Disciplined, yet an attitude that suggests
independence. He never speaks. ,
   
 

His attitude is cantankerous at best, rebellious
with more than overtones of cruelty at the ~
‘worst ... Proud of his physical strength, he most.
dislikes: The Fox among the othex Warriors, ©. .-5.
although Swan rums a close second ..- a natural.
inclination for mixing violence and sex. 7
