FADE IN:
THE RANGER COAT OF ARMS

We MOVE ACROSS the badge, taking in the LION, with its front
paw raised; the SHIELD with its tomahawk and powderhorn;
the SCROLL with "Rangers Lead The Way." And we hear, 0.S.:

CHIEF OFFICER
Army Rangers have a proud
history... Since the Revolutionary
War in 1756, Rangers have been
leading the way in every major
confrontation in which the US has
been involved...

Te DOWN, coming off the coat-of-arms, we find ourselves
n

INT. U.S. RANGER DISCHARGE CEREMONY - DAY

Below the coat-of-arms, the CHIEF OFFICER stands before a
group of RANGERS - clear-eyed men, square-shouldered with
resolve...

CHIEF OFFICER (CONT.)
And you men are a credit to this
fine heritage and I am sorry to see
you go... But you have served your
time well and displayed the
intestinal fortitude required to
fight on to the Ranger objective
and complete the mission, never
leaving a fallen comrade behind,
regardless of the odds or the
enemy.

WE MOVE ACROSS the group of Rangers... Settling on one -
CAMERON POE, his chest full of medals... And CUT TO:

EXT. ALABAMA PORT - DUSK

WE SWEEP ACROSS this port-side sprawl, passing over the
working OIL REFINERIES - huge, steel DERRICKS sucking at the
ground; towering BURN-STACKS emitting BURSTS of FLAME...

We take it out OVER THE ESTUARY, FLYING ACROSS THE WATER at
last settling on a lone

TUGBOAT
as it chuffs toward the shore... And standing alone on the

bow is Cameron Poe, still in uniform and black beret, duffel
at his feet... Still we HEAR THE C.O.

I thank-you. America thanks you...
Good luck in wherever you may go...

Poe looks off at the approaching PORT TOWN...
EXT. PIER

Night falls as the tug docks... Poe humps his duffel and
walks the gangplank to dry ground...

EXT. PARTY BOAT - ESTABLISHING

Up on its moorings, this old pleasure boat has been
converted into a saloon...

INT. PARTY BOAT

Fairly crowded. Longshoremen types mostly. One waitress -
TRICIA POE, 25, delivers a round of beers to a table of
fishermen... She goes back to the service bar... Another
WAITRESS is there... Tricia looks at her watch...

WAITRESS
When's he supposed to be here?
TRICIA POE
Any minute now... Which ain’t soon
enough --
WAITRESS

You got it bad, girl --

TRICIA POE
You have no idea...
(to the BARTENDER)
Five shots of Wild Turkey, Dale --

She rests on the bar, clearly exhausted... Again, she looks
to the front door... This time, she’s rewarded...

Poe has entered... He scans the room for his wife... Sees
her... He lets the duffel bag fall. Approaches. Stops a
foot from her. They regard one another in silence.

POE
Hello, hummingbird --

They fall into each others arms... Kiss passionately... Then
he drops to his knees -- he’s facing her belly...

POE

He puts his ear to her stomach. She smiles, touches his
hair, as he listens... He pretends to hear all sorts of
things...

She's doin’ fine --

After listening, nodding --

POE
Uh-huh... Right... You’re kidding
me...

TRICIA POE
Sweetie -- ?

POE

Shhh, can’t you see I’m in the

middle of something here... ?
(listens again)

They played three encores?

Outside, THUNDER BOOMS... Crack of lightning... And the
front door opens... And in walks BILLY JOE, SMOKE, and
RONNIE, three of the greasiest turds ever to be shat on

humanity. Drunk and boiling... Our waitress friend sees
them:
WAITRESS
Shit...
om They stomp to the bar... The crowd parts for them, keeping a
distance... Billy Joe sees Poe and Tricia. He walks over..
BILLY JOE

Tricia Poe - whyn’t you join us for
one, darlin’? ,

TRICIA POE
No thanks --

Smoke and Ronnie come up behind Billy Jo --

RONNIE
Who's huckleberry?
BILLY JOE

question...
POE

TRICIA POE

SMOKE
(super-drunk)
That's right. We're regulars -- !
Regular hound-dogs!

Smoke and Ronnie chortle... Nothing from Poe... He stares at
the men... Only Billy Joe remains lucid; wicked; taunting:

BILLY JOE
I tell you what, soldier boy: go
buy us nice fellas a round...

He tosses some balled-up bills at Poe... They hit him in the
face and fall...

BILLY JOE (CONT.)
++. and when you get back we'll
talk about you lettin’ us play some
night-baseball with your
bitch-kitty...

Poe stares stonily at the men.

TRICIA POE
Cameron. We don‘t need trouble.
(Poe doesn’t move) —
Come on, daddy. Let‘’s dance.

Poe, very reluctantly, agrees. They dance off. Our trio of
miscreants watch them go...

ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Cue the appropriate power ballad... Poe and Tricia hold each
other, moving to the music. He’s still coming down from the
confrontation. She’s just relieved she stopped it when she
did...

CLOSE ON - Billy Joe, Smoke, Ronnie. As they watch Poe and
Tricia dance. Their drunken eyes crawling all over Tricia’s
body; her lips; her hair...

Poe and Tricia continue their dance:

TRICIA POE
For a second there, you were that
guy again...

POE
I know.

TRICIA POE

That guy ain’t supposed to come
around anymore.

POE
I know. He won’t.

EXT. PARTY BOAT - NIGHT

Pouring down rain... The burn-stacks FLARE above... Poe and

Tricia move for their car... Poe’s face screws-up in agony.

He whips ee Billy Joe, JET-BLADE gleaming, has slashed
Poe's back.

BILLY JOE
Let’s go, huckleberry. Shock me.

Poe kicks the knife from Billy Joe’s hand. Billy Joe stands
there, defenseless now. Blood trickles from Poe's face. He
looks inhuman.

Everything SLOWS DOWN NOW. But, in dizzying SLO-MO, Poe
punches Billy Joe in the ribs, breaking three, doubling

him over. Billy Joe is out... Tricia cries for him to
stop...

Poe doesn’t. The rain hammers down in sheets... The
burn- stacks ERUPT... The derricks ka-chung.... And Poe

drives his fist into his nose. BILLY JOE'S NOSE-BONE PIKES
HIS BRAIN. Billy Joe collapses...

Poe snaps out of his fury. Catches his breath. A bolt of
light as the saloon door opens and Ronnie lurches out... He
goes to Billy Joe. Billy Joe’s eyes are wide open. Ronnie
feels Billy’s carotid artery.

RONNIE
You killed him! YOU FUCKING KILLED
HIM!

Ronnie screams. Tricia sobs. Poe looks at her, as the rain
beats down, and the burn-stacks explode above, and SIRENS
wail in the distance... CUT TO:

INT. COUNTY JAIL

Poe sits on a cot. A PUBLIC DEFENDER, crusty, unshaven,
possibly drunk, sits opposite.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
Admit the facts and enter a plea
bargain. Were you drunk?

POE
No.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
Do you have a history of violence?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
You could get ten years. You admit

The Public Defender pulls A WHISKEY FLASK from his breast
pocket, es a slug and offers it to Poe. Poe just stares
at him and --

4X INT. ALABAMA COUNTY COURTROOM - MORNING 4A
Poe and the Public Defender sit before the judge.

JUDGE
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded
guilty to manslaughter in the first

Tricia Poe watches nervously from the gallery.

It is the order of this court that
you be remanded to a federal
penitentiary where you shall remain
incarcerated for a term not less
than....

4) Poe opens a care PACKAGE from his wife... It contains a
LETTER, PHOTOS, a few race-car magazines. And four
spectacular PINK SNOWBALL CUPCAKES... Poe sets to reading
the letter and gobbling the pink snowballs...

While outside his cell, another CON (BABY-O) mops the tier
floor... He mops by Poe’s cell... Staring at Poe, as Poe
devours the pink snowballs...

Poe, oblivious to Baby-O, continues to eat and read... At
last, feeling eyes upon him, he looks up... Sees Baby-O...
Baby-O’s gaze rests solely on the single remaining snowball.

Poe looks at Baby-O... Looks at the snowball... And with a
gesture of supreme human kindness that only those
locked-down can appreciate, Poe hands Baby-O the snowball
through the bars...

Baby-O bites into the cake and our die is cast...

5) Continue our PHOTOGRAPH MOTIF... Only now, pictures of
Tricia and Poe’s DAUGHTER are joined by PICTURES of Poe and
Baby-0... Friends...

6) Poe lies awake in his cell... There’s a bizarre, distant
ROAR... ALARMS BLARE... CELL DOORS OPEN... Poe steps to the
doors to investigate --

-- when a TORRENT OF INMATES FLOOD THE CORRIDOR. They carry
pipes and make-shift weapons... One CON takes a pipe-swing
at him... Poe is hurled back into his cell... Out cold...

The inmates charge past... A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL is tossed into
his cell... Flames roar through his cell...

IN THE CORRIDOR

The inmates charge on... One figure fights against the
tide... Moving back towards Poe's cell... Baby-O...

Poe comes to, forehead bloodied... His cell is a fiery
inferno now... He struggles to stand, but he cannot... He
collapses... As the flames comes closer... And in this
moment, he believes he might just die this way...

When, at once, an ARM is thrust through the sheet of
flames... Poe reaches up... Grabs Baby-O’s hand... And
Baby-O pulls him up and out to safety, just as the entire
cell is engulfed in flames...

The hazy heat-waves dance and swirl and take us through a
feverish DISSOLVE TO:

time ever on July 14. I can’t wait
for July 14."

WIDER ~- CAMERON POE, now 34, reads the letter to Baby-0, who
is now Poe’s cellmate...

Baby-O has a packet of YELLOW HAPPY FACE STICKERS, which
he's slapping all over every naked surface of the cell...

SUPER: 8 YEARS LATER.

POE (CONT.)
Ain't that just the cutest little
thing you ever have heard... ?

BABY-O
Makes me all oogly inside, man, I
swear --

Poe scowls at him and folds up the letter and places it into
his BANKER’S BOX and removes PHOTOS of classic cars ('59
Dodge, ‘70 Chevelle SS 396, etc.) from the mirror. A PHOTO
of Tricia. Then a PHOTO of a LITTLE GIRL, about 7, with
blonde spit curls.

Poe lifts a sorry-looking STUFFED RABBIT from a bag.

BABY-O
What's this?

POE
So I shouldn't see my little girl,
on her birthday, empty-handed.

BABY-O

it into his hand. He breaks it apart... breaking the wax,

finger, is the TIP of a PIN.

Poe, kneeling, reaching down to Pinball, finishes writing

the following on Pinball’s T-SHIRT: TO VINCE LARKIN. U.S. :

Poe grabs Pinball‘s arm and leg, which are pretzeled around

the strut. He triea to unpretzel them, but rigor mortis

prevents. The appendages have hardened.

DIAMOND DOG (o.s.)
You done, man?

Poe looks aft. Diamond Dog is returning.

POR
Shit.....

Poe switches to sitting position, his legs dangling out of
the wheel bay. He kicks at Pinhall‘’s corpse. Again and
again. Pinball won’t budge.

With one final kick, Pinball suddenly detaches and falls
away. Poe's momentum carries him out of the wheel bay, his
feet lodging in the landing gear apparatus.

FX SHOT - starting on C.U. of Poe, CAMERA seemingly falls
with Pinball 200 feet below the aircraft, ending with a WIDE
SHOT of the plane passing overhead above us.

Poe hangs upside down outside the C-123K, his body buffeted
by wind, slamming against the aircraft’s belly. Poe tries
to pull himself up. He can’t.

Diamond appears above Poe. He reaches down and grasps
Poe's ankle ann lifts him back into the plane.
