PURPOSES ONLY
FADE IN:

EXT. L.A. STREETS - NIGHT

An unmarked cop CAR GUNS through traffic, cherry top
flashing. Slides through a turn. SCREECHES to a stop.

INT. CAR

MARTIN RIGGS driving, ROGER MURTAUGH riding shotgun.
Both stunned at what they're seeing.

MURTAUGH
Oh, shit...

THEIR POV

Hell. A dozen different fires light the street. In the
center of it all, two blocks away, walking away from
them, squirting a flamethrower with one hand and FIRING
an AK-47 with the other, a human tank wearing level-3,
full-body armor, facemask, etc. He napalms another car.

ANGLE BACK

MURTAUGH
What're we gonna do?

RIGGS
Run him over.

Riggs FLOORS it at the guy.
MURTAUGH
What if he turns and shoots us with
that friggin assault rifle?

RIGGS
Maybe he won't. He hasn't yet.

MURTAUGH
Right. But what if he does?

RIGGS
Try being positive for once, Rog.
We're cops.

MURTAUGH
Unlike you, my life matters to me.

RIGGS
You got another way to stop him?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 4
MURTAUGH
«+. No. Okay, you're right, we're
cops... I hope he doesn't turn.
RIGGS

Then do be a Do-bee, don't be a
Don't-bee. Will him not to turn.

MURTAUGH
Will him.
RIGGS
Will him. Yeah. C'mon...
(chants )

--- Don't turn, don't turn...
C'mon, Rog, will him with me...

MURTAUGH
(beat; what the
hell)
Don't turn, don't turn...
TOGETHER
--- Don't turn, don't turn...
RIGGS
He's turning.
MURTAUGH
Oh, shit.
EXT. STREET 5

The CAR SKIDS sideways as Riggs throws the wheel over.
The human TANK OPENS UP on them. BULLETS SHRED the
vehicle. Riggs and Murtaugh bail out and take cover
behind the wheels. There's fire all around them.

MURTAUGH
Had to turn so my side faced him?

RIGGS
There's no right turn here.

The shooting stops. Riggs and Murtaugh pop up FIRING.
SLUGS BOUNCE off the guy's body armor. They drop back.

MURTAUGH
We're in trouble.

RIGGS
It's your fault, Rog.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MURTAUGH
My fault? How's it my fault? I
said the words.

RIGGS
You said 'em. But I know you
didn't believe ‘em.

Murtaugh rolls his eyes. Peeks. The human tank's

walking toward them. MORE BULLETS. He torches a kiosk.

RIGGS
Okay. I'll draw his fire. You
run for cover.

MURTAUGH
No, no, no. I'1l draw the fire,
and you run for cover.

RIGGS
I got less to lose, so you do the
running.

MURTAUGH

You're younger, in love --

RIGGS
And you got a wife and kids. Are
you nuts, Rog? I got lots less to
lose. I'm going first.

MURTAUGH
Riggs...
RIGGS
Get ready to run, Rog.
MURTAUGH
... I'm not supposed to tell you
this, but... Lorna's pregnant.

You're gonna be a father.
Riggs wasn't expecting that one.
MURTAUGH
She's afraid to tell you. You
never discussed having children.

RIGGS
+. That kid with the crayon...

MURTAUGH
What kid?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

(2) 5
RIGGS
He draws stuff and it comes to
life... Draws the moon so he can
walk in the moonlight... Purple
crayon... Don't remember his
name... Just popped into my head

when you... A baby...

MURTAUGH
Yeah, a baby. And I'm older, and
I've been a dad, so I'm going

first.
RIGGS
(then)
You can't go first, Rog.
MURTAUGH
Why not?
RIGGS

‘Cause there's something I'm not
supposed to tell you, too...
Rianne's pregnant. You're gonna
be a grandfather.

MURTAUGH
Rianne can't be pregnant. She's
not married... Oh, shit...

RIGGS
It was an accident. She and the
guy aren't serious... She was

gonna tell you this weekend when
you were nice and relaxed.

Riggs peeks at the human tank, now standing a short
distance away with his gun leveled. Riggs ducks back as
BULLETS RAKE the car again. Murtaugh looks sick.

MURTAUGH
Not sure I want to live now.

RIGGS
The kid needs a grandad, Rog...
Take off your clothes.

MURTAUGH
‘Scuse me?

RIGGS
Strip, Rog. Fast.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3) 5
MURTAUGH
What the hell for?
RIGGS
You run. He turns. Seeing you in
your undies distracts him -- it'd
distract me -- and that's when I
shoot.
MURTAUGH
Shoot what?
RIGGS

The one place he's vulnerable --

MURTAUGH
You mean gonna shoot him in the --

RIGGS
No, not there. The valve of that
napalm tank.

MURTAUGH
You're gonna hit a little bitty
valve before he shoots me?

RIGGS
-.-. Trust me, Rog.

MURTAUGH
Trust you?

Beat. Murtaugh starts stripping.

MURTAUGH
I gotta be crazy.

RIGGS
A second ago, you didn't care if
you lived.

MURTAUGH
That was before the prospect of
ending up dead in my underwear.

RIGGS
Just hurry, Rog. It's getting a
little warm here.

MURTAUGH
++. Is he black?

RIGGS
Can't tell with all that armor.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (4) 5

MURTAUGH
Not him. The father of the baby.
He's black, right?

RIGGS
I don't know.

MURTAUGH
Please let him be black. Not the
blond kid with pits in his face.
.+. Bad enough she did that condom
commercial. She could've at least
used 'em

RIGGS
C'mon, c'mon...

MURTAUGH
(finishes undressing)
I don't wanna die in my underwear.

Riggs looks. Murtaugh's wearing pink satin boxers.

RIGGS
What's --

MURTAUGH
Not now.

RIGGS

Are those pink --

MURTAUGH
Not now. Just hit the damn tank.

Riggs drops it. They get set to move.
RIGGS
Also, flap your arms and make
noises like a bird.

MURTAUGH
What for?

RIGGS
It'll distract him more. I need
him to turn. Ready? On two.

MURTAUGH
On two? We always go on three.

RIGGS
Change of pace, okay? One, two --

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (5) 5

Murtaugh bolts from behind the car, flapping his arms and
making noises like Riggs told him. The guy turns... and
the sight does make him pause. Just long enough for
Riggs to stand and SHOOT.

Riggs' slug tears off the stem of the flamethrower tank,
releasing napalm in a high-pressure, burning jet that
rockets the human tank off the ground and through the air
toward a nearby gas station. He impacts a gas pump.

Fuel ignites. The STATION EXPLODES. A tanker TRUCK
offloading gas is BLOWN upward OUT OF FRAME.

Riggs and Murtaugh watch the inferno. Beat.

MURTAUGH
I'm too young to be a grandfather.

RIGGS
What about me? I'm gonna be someone's
dad.

MURTAUGH
«+. Think that bird thing really
helped?
RIGGS
Nah, I just wanted to see if
you'd do it.
Something catches their eye. They look up.

RIGGS /MURTAUGH
Oh, shit!
They start running. A moment later, the tanker drops
from the sky behind them. A few tons of metal falling at
9.81 meters/second/second. Right onto their car... Riggs
and Murtaugh get to safety. Look back. Beat.

RIGGS
Never a dull moment, huh, Rog?

MURTAUGH
Not since I met you.

AD LIBS: 1) Wasn't that a gas?
2) That's oil, folks.

MAIN TITLES.

EXT. PRISON (PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA) - NIGHT 6
A detail of Red Chinese soldiers waits outside the gates.
SUPERIMPOSE: NINE MONTHS LATER

The gates open. More PRC soldiers escort out four
Chinese men wearing prisoners' shock belts. The oldest
of the four is in his 70s, dignified. The youngest is
50ish and menacing, eye like a pit viper... They're led
toward a vehicle in a waiting convoy. A young PRC
soldier touches the older man's arm to help him in. Ina
flash, the pit viper strikes the soldier dead for the
offense. Executes a gravity-defying flying double kick
that snaps the soldier's neck. Another soldier quickly
jabs a button on a remote control unit. 50,000 volts
from the shock belts jolt the prisoner's bodies. Three
of them drop instantly to the ground in agony... Not the
pit viper... Incredibly, he stays on his feet. Teeth
gritted. Muscles quivering from the punishing electric
current. Staring back at his tormenter. A full ten
seconds... The soldier releases the button. The flow of
electricity stops... As the pit viper moves to help the
old man up --

EXT. AIRPORT (CHINA) - NIGHT 7

The four prisoners and the PRC Army guard detail board a
large, commercial-type jet. The door's shut and sealed.

INT. JET - COCKPIT 8

CLOSE ON a navigation plotter. Destination: L.A.

EXT. AIRPORT 9

The jet takes off into the dark sky.

EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 10

Murtaugh's boat bobs on the sea.

EXT. MURTAUGH'S BOAT 11

A 12-foot, live shark thrashes madly inside the cockpit,
jaws snapping. REVEAL Riggs, Murtaugh, and LEO GETZ
looking down at it from the tuna tower. Clearly, they've
scrambled there to escape the furious beast.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MURTAUGH
That shark damages my new boat,
I'm taking it outta you, Leo.

LEO
I didn't mean to catch it.

RIGGS
Then why do you want to keep it?

MURTAUGH
Yeah, what the hell you want a
a shark for?

LEO

The teeth'1l look good on a wall.
RIGGS

They gotta stop snapping first.
LEO

«+. Maybe it'll go to sleep.
RIGGS

Go have a conversation with it.
MURTAUGH

Doesn't look tired to me.
RIGGS

Eating Leo might wear it out.
LEO

Ha-ha.
MURTAUGH

It's a thought.
LEO

Fun-ny.
RIGGS

Do sharks eat their own kind?

LEO
Stop, I'm in stitches.

Riggs and Murtaugh move to grab Leo. Leo moves away.

LEO
Okay, okay... It's my fish, I'll
take care of it.

Leo moves off, down a hatch into the cabin.

RIGGS
Why'd we bring Leo along, anyway?

MURTAUGH
He said you invited him.

RIGGS
He told me you did.

thrashes some more.

RIGGS
...-Last guy trip before the
baby's here.... It's all about

to change, Rog.

MURTAUGH
Easy on the boat, shark!

Leo pops his head out of the hatch.

LEO
Where's my bag?

MURTAUGH
Starboard side aft.

LEO
Starboard. That's left.

MURTAUGH
Port's left. Starboard's right.

LEO
'Right,' yeah. Right side aft.

Leo disappears again. Beat.

MURTAUGH
Riggs... I've kept my nose out of
it, but you and Lorna... you're
having a baby... you're living
together... you're not getting
married...

RIGGS
That violate your family values,
Rog?

MURTAUGH

Just trying to understand --

(CONTINUED)

(3) 11

RIGGS
I mean, Rianne's not exactly
married either, is she?

MURTAUGH
... That's below the belt.

RIGGS
«+. You're right. I'm sorry...
I was married once before, Rog.
She's dead 'cause I'm a cop.

MURTAUGH
That was a terrible thing. But
Lorna's a cop, too. I don't see
the problem.

RIGGS
The problem... The problem is,
maybe I don't wear the wedding
ring anymore, Rog, but I look
down, and it's still there.

The two men share a long look. Leo pops up again.

LEO
You did say aft.
MURTAUGH
A-f-t. Aft.
LEO

And that's a fucking word?

MURTAUGH
Back of the cabin, right side.

LEO
So why not just say that?...
People get around water, they
gotta talk all that nautical shit.

Leo disappears again. Murtaugh turns back to Riggs.

MURTAUGH
What's Lorna say about this?

RIGGS
We haven't talked about it.

MURTAUGH
A few days 'til the baby's due, and
you haven't talked about marriage
at_all?

RIGGS
Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?

MURTAUGH
Do we want Leo to shoot the shark?

REVEAL Leo's about to shoot the shark with a pistol.

MURTAUGH
No, Leo!

Murtaugh jumps, wrests the gun from him.

LEO
Jeez. What's the big deal?

MURTAUGH
You're shooting a gun in my boat!

LEO
I was just gonna kill Jaws there.

MURTAUGH
Nobody's killing it. I'm not
letting a good animal die just so
you can have its teeth, Leo.

LEO
You're crankier since finding out
you're gonna be a grandpa.

(CONTINUED)
11

13.

CONTINUED: (5) 11

RIGGS
(re: gun)
This isn't mine or Rog's.

LEO
I got my P.I. license now,
right?... A gumshoe sometimes

finds himself in ugly situations.

MURTAUGH
You're an ugly situation, period.

RIGGS
It's illegal to carry a weapon
without a permit.

Riggs tosses the gun in the sea. Blam! A GUNSHOT.

RIGGS
Was that Leo's gun?

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! From the other direction. They
turn... and there's the bow of a two-hundred-foot
freighter about to run them down. Leo screams. Murtaugh
leaps to the helm. Jams the throttle ahead full. The
boat jumps forward... and the freighter rushes by, inches
away, snagging fishing lines, pulling poles from sockets.
And then it's gone.

MURTAUGH
My boat... Thank God...

RIGGS
The gunfire came from the ship.
Let's go, Rog.

MURTAUGH
Go where?

RIGGS
After it. Someone could be in
trouble.

MURTAUGH

«+. I'll radio the Coast Guard.

RIGGS
Fine. And we'll go after it.

Riggs moves to the helm, jams down the THROTTLE.

(CONTINUED)
11

CONTINUED: (6) 11

MURTAUGH

Hey! Careful!

(takes the helm)
I'll drive. You hurt things. I
don't want my new boat hurt.

(snags the VHS)
Coast Guard, 'Code 7,' Coast
Guard, 'Code 7,' over.

RIGGS
Leo, get our guns and badges.

Leo goes. Over the RADIO, we hear --

COAST GUARDSMAN (V.O.)
"Code 7,' this is Coast Guard Group
L.A. Long Beach, go ahead.

MURTAUGH
Coast Guard, 'Code 7.' This is
Sgt. Murtaugh, L.A.P.D. Want to
report gun shots aboard a
freighter headed due north
approximately one mile from
L.A. Harbor. Over.

COAST GUARD (V.O.)
‘Code 7,' what is the name of the
vessel? Over.

MURTAUGH
(Name). Outta Hong Kong. Over.

COAST GUARDSMAN (V.O.)
Roger, 'Code 7.' Wait one.

Leo reappears with badges and guns. Re: Riggs' pistol!--

LEO
New Beretta?
RIGGS
Testing a laser sight for the

department.
He aims at Leo. A red laser dot appears on Leo's nose.

RIGGS
Got a mole you want removed?

LEO
Hey, don't fuck with that.

Then, to Riggs, as they pull in behind the ship --

MURTAUGH
We'll just hang here safe and
outta sight 'til the Coast Guard
arrives.

Whereupon a searchlight on the ship suddenly illuminates
them. Beat.

RIGGS
What now?

MURTAUGH
... Show 'em our badges?

They hold up badges. Multiple WEAPONS OPEN UP on them.
Murtaugh throws the helm over as Riggs FIRES BACK. Nails
the searchlight. Keeps FIRING.

FREIGHTER 14

One of the shooters takes a bullet. Knocks over the
searchlight as he goes down FIRING. SLUGS PUNCTURE

a stack of kerosene drums lashed topside. Leaking fuel
reaches the broken searchlight, still sparking on the
deck. The FUEL IGNITES. The DRUMS EXPLODE.

EXT. FREIGHTER - BRIDGE 15
The Chinese captain looks back as another fuel DRUM
EXPLODES. The stern's engulfed in flame. He yells to

the crew (italics indicate Chinese) --

CAPTAIN
Abandon ship!

As people leave their positions to abandon ship --

MURTAUGH'S BOAT 16
A short distance away. Watching the fireworks on the
freighter. No one's shooting at them now. They see a
lifeboat lower from the freighter.

(CONTINUED)
17.

16 CONTINUED: 16

RIGGS
They're trying to get away. Let's
get over there, Rog.

MURTAUGH
Coast Guard'll be here any minute.

RIGGS
And those guys'1ll be gone.

Beat. Murtaugh relents, steers for the ship.

MURTAUGH
They better not shoot up my boat.

Leo peeks out from somewhere.

LEO
Helluva fucking fishing trip.

RIGGS
Shut up and keep your head down.

Murtaugh pulls up alongside the lifeboat as it hits the
water, still tethered to the ship. Riggs jumps aboard
the bouncing craft, surprising two crewmen within.

RIGGS
Ahoy.

They move to shoot Riggs. Riggs NAILS both. But a
bullet parts one end of the line Riggs is holding -- a
line rigged up to the ship -- and suddenly, Riggs is
SHOOTING up into the air. Ina flash, he's hauled to the
davits, drops to --

EXT. FREIGHTER - DECK 17
in the midst of other heavily-armed crewmen.

RIGGS
You're under arrest.

Someone OPENS UP on him, and the GUNFIGHT's on.

INT. FREIGHTER - BRIDGE 18

The untended wheel turns slowly... pointing the ship
toward the not-so-distant lights of L.A.

MURTAUGH'S BOAT 19
Murtaugh watches the freighter turn.

MURTAUGH
It's heading for the beach.

FREIGHTER 20

The ship approaches the shore. Riggs ends one GUNFIGHT
and gets into another, finally engaging a gunman at the
very tip of the ship's bow. The gunman's behind a large
winch, pins Riggs down with an automatic weapon. Riggs
can't hit him and can't run... when he sees the ship's
metal gunwale converging behind the gunman. Quickly
eyeballs the angles involved. Aims the laser down the
gunwale. FIRES. Banks a slug off the steel. Takes out
the gunman with a ricochet... whereupon the ship runs
aground. The abrupt stop topples cranes, everything not
fastened down, and tosses Riggs hard against a winch,
knocking his gun away... Remaining crew throw lines over
to jump ship. Riggs shakes off the blow from the winch.
Catches the ship's Captain heading for the side. The
Captain whips a kung fu move on him. kK.O.s Riggs... The
Captain moves toward a rope. Two crewmen are in line to
go down. The Captain's not in a waiting mood. Pulls a
GUN, SHOOTS them both off the ship. Grabs the rope and
slides down.

MURTAUGH'S BOAT 21

Murtaugh's followed the freighter in, stays just beyond
the surf line near the beached ship.

LEO
Holy shit. That was great.
Wasn't that great?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (Al)

MURTAUGH
Hope Riggs is okay.

Leo regards the shark, now motionless in the cockpit.

CONTINUED: 21

LEO
I think the shark's asleep now.

BOOM! Another EXPLOSION up on the ship's deck. Murtaugh
looks up to see a burning OIL DRUM blown high into the
air. He follows the drum's trajectory.

MURTAUGH
Oh, shit... Jump, Leo.

Murtaugh shoves Leo off the boat... just as the heavy,
fiery drum crushes it. The boat instantly begins
sinking. Murtaugh bobs near Leo, looking on.

MURTAUGH
My boat...

As the boat goes down, water begins to cover the shark
and... revives it.

LEO
I think the shark's awake again.

MURTAUGH
Oh, shit!

Murtaugh and Leo begin stroking madly as the shark swims
free of the wreckage. Leo urges himself on.

LEO
Swim, swim, swim...

Murtaugh sees the lifeboat, still tied to the freighter,
drifting behind it. He swims over and climbs aboard.
Then calls to Leo, paddling frantically nearby --

MURTAUGH
Leo, this way! Over here!

Leo sees Murtaugh, alters course for the boat. He
glances back. The shark's coming for him.

LEO
Agh! Swim! Swim! Swim!

The shark closes quickly on the little guy. It's about
to nail him... when Murtaugh grabs Leo's shirt, hauls him
into the lifeboat. They tumble onto the floorboards.

LEO
You see that? Fucking shark
almost ate me.

MURTAUGH
What you get for trying to take
his teeth.

Murtaugh stands, watches his boat sink from sight. Beat.

MURTAUGH
Since meeting Riggs, I've had my
house destroyed, my car wrecked,
and my boat sunk... What's left?

LEO
That's pretty much it.

Murtaugh sees a "Code 7" life ring floating next to the
lifeboat. He picks it up. All that's left of his boat.

BACK ON FREIGHTER 22

Riggs is slowly coming around from the karate chop.

Finds his gun. Stands. There's a CREAK behind him.
Riggs spins. A hatch is opening. Riggs aims. The laser
pinpoints an old Chinese woman emerging. Behind her are
more Chinese. Other hatches open. Riggs lowers his gun,
watches, stunned, as seemingly endless numbers of ragged,
tired, and frightened Chinese men, women, and children
slowly emerge onto the deck.

EXT. BEACH - NEAR SHIP - LATER 23

Coast Guard, LAPD, LAFD, INS -- you name it, they're
there, plus news crews and looky-loos. The Chinese have
been corralled by INS near the boat.

EXT. FREIGHTER DECK 24

Riggs, Murtaugh and an INS AGENT look down at the Chinese
herded together on the beach.

INS AGENT
Coast Guard interdicts about one
of these a month.

MURTAUGH
Raggedy-looking folks.

INS AGENT
Six weeks locked in a hold with
one toilet. Rice and a little
fish to eat... Lousy deal for
thirty-five grand a head.

(CONTINUED)
24

CONTINUED:

22.

RIGGS
Thirty-five grand? Where'd they
get that kind of money?

INS AGENT
Didn't. Gotta work it off.
Snakeheads, the smugglers, they
sell ‘em as cheap labor.

MURTAUGH
Sell ‘em?

INS AGENT
Like slaves.

We see the word register with Murtaugh.

INS AGENT
Women and girls're forced into
prostitution. Rest earn seventy
cents an hour in the sweatshops.

RIGGS
They gotta work off thirty-five
G's making seventy cents an hour?

INS AGENT
Takes years. Then the debt's
gone, and the people're used up.
From work, from drugs, from
living two to a bed in some rat
hole 'til they quit caring.

RIGGS
What about these people here?

INS AGENT
They'11 claim asylum, say they
were persecuted, like everybody
else. We'll end up sending 'em
back. Cost a goddamn fortune.

MURTAUGH
What happened to 'Bring me your
tired, your poor, your wretched
masses yearning to be free'?

INS AGENT
Now it reads 'no vacancies’...
You'd think word'd get back, and
they'd give us a break, but they
don't. Snakehead biz is booming.

He indicates the shot-up corpse of a Chinese man nearby.

INS AGENT
They pop one every boatload.
Shows the rest what'll happen if
they run off or don't pay.

Murtaugh regards the body a moment.

MURTAUGH
‘Least he's no one's slave now.

Beat. Riggs looks up, sees LEE BUTTERS approaching.
Butters is a junior-grade detective, twenties, black.

RIGGS
That kid's here -- what's his
name !--

MURTAUGH
It's a food. Burgers? Bagels?

RIGGS
Breadsticks?

MURTAUGH
Biscuits?

RIGGS
Butters.

MURTAUGH

Right. Butters. Always kisses my
ass. Gets me coffee 'n shit.

RIGGS
Probably looks up to you. You're
a role model. An elder statesman.

MURTAUGH
He wants to be like me, he
shouldn't be kissing butt.

BUTTERS
(walks up)
Sergeant Riggs, Sergeant Murtaugh
-- what're you doing here?

RIGGS
Long story.

BUTTERS
(to Murtaugh)
You're all wet, sir. You need a
blanket or something?

(CONTINUED)
24.

24 CONTINUED: (3) 24
Before Murtaugh can say "no" --

BUTTERS
I need a couple blankets here!

Someone hands him blankets. He gives both to Murtaugh.

BUTTERS
Here you go, sir.
RIGGS
(mot happy)
Thanks, Burgers.

BUTTERS
Butters.

RIGGS
Got a homicide over there.

A troubled look crosses Butters' face.

BUTTERS
Homicide?

RIGGS
You're a homicide detective.

MURTAUGH
There's two more over the side.

Butters crosses. Looks under the sheet.

BUTTERS
Goddamn it!

Riggs and Murtaugh don't understand the sudden reaction.

MURTAUGH
What?

BUTTERS
He was shot!

RIGGS
Yeah.

BUTTERS

Four times! At close range! Like
he was executed!

MURTAUGH
He was executed.

RIGGS
The crew did it.
(CONTINUED)
24 CONTINUED: (4)

BUTTERS
That really pisses me off!

Riggs and Murtaugh exchange a look.

BUTTERS
Folks're getting killed left,
right, and center in this town!
Now we're importing victims.
Gang-bangers wanna cap each other,
no problem! Shoot it out with the
cops -- boom, you're dead, who

cares? Some poor guy just trying to

get through the shit 24-7-365, and

he's whacked, that really pisses
me off!

 

MURTAUGH
Easy, Biscuits.

BUTTERS
(beat; calmer)
Just don't like it when people do
bad things to good folks.

RIGGS
... Listen, Bagels, it's been a
long night. We'll catch you
tomorrow, okay?

BUTTERS
Yeah. Okay. Be sure to dry off,
Sergeant Murtaugh.

Murtaugh just nods. He and Murtaugh head off.

The question hangs there. Murtaugh suddenly stops.

MURTAUGH
Left something in the lifeboat.

RIGGS
I'll get a patrol car to drop me
at my truck. See you tomorrow...
Sorry about your boat, Rog. I
know it meant a lot.

They share a look. Then Riggs heads off. Murtaugh goes
to the beached lifeboat. Retrieves the "Code 7" life
ring. In doing so, leans on the tarp covering the
boat's forward half. A MUFFLED CRY. Beat. Murtaugh
lifts the tarp, revealing ten Chinese -- men, women and
children. Frightened stowaways, huddled together...

INT. BENNY CHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26

UNCLE BENNY CHAN's seventies, wearing all Ralph Lauren
Polo. Sitting with Benny, slightly apart, is WAH SING
KU, thirty, discerning, full of dangerous potentials we
can only guess at right now. Dressed in Shanghai Tang,
modern clothes with classical Chinese touches, qualities
Ku possesses. Both men, plus an Uncle Benny enforcer,
YEE, have their attention focused on GEORGE PROODY, a
young State Department suit holding up a sheaf of papers.

PROODY
Four sets of papers. Totally
genuine. They'll get in the
country, and they'll be able to
stay. Forever. U.S. citizens.

He hands the papers to Benny.

PROODY
Ask 'em to vote the incumbent
party next election. Help me
keep my job with the State
Department.

UNCLE BENNY
(eyeing reports)
Bloody marvelous...

PROODY
They've red-flagged all Asian
visas lately. Those weren't easy
to slip through.

UNCLE BENNY
(looks up; warmly)
You've been a big help. We're
very grateful.

Another enforcer, CHU, enters with information. Looks
at Ku, who indicates it's okay for him to speak. (In
Chinese (subtitles).

CHU
«+. The ship went aground.

KU
(controlled
agitation)
What about the merchandise?

CHU
It's missing.

UNCLE BENNY
I'll find out about it immediately.

The look Ku gives Benny is shaming, and Benny feels it.

PROODY
Something wrong?

UNCLE BENNY
(instant charm again)
Small delivery problem... Thank
you, Mr. Proody.

Benny nods to Yee. Yee hands Proody a bundle of cash.
Proody scans it. He's satisfied. Beat.

UNCLE BENNY
Good night.

Proody is suddenly wary of his situation. Knows he's
vulnerable now. Knows they're killers. With an eye on the
room, he goes... After which Ku pulls a loop of Buddhist
prayer beads from a pocket and fingers them, lost in dark
meditation, while no one else speaks.

He's alive and ten thousand bucks richer.

EXT. METROLINK CROSSING - NIGHT 29

Next to the L.A. River. Lights flash as the barricade
lowers. In the distance, a train headlight. Proody's
car pulls up and stops.

INT. PROODY'S CAR 30

The train nearing. Proody dreaming about what he'll do
with the bribe-money... when smash!... his CAR'S suddenly
STRUCK hard from behind. Proody looks back. No
headlights... Just the grill of a truck... He fumbles for
the gun... Blinding light from the train fills the car.
Proody can't react in time... The truck shoves him onto
the tracks, in front of the speeding train.

EXT. CROSSING 31

The TRAIN SLAMS into Proody's car. Launches. it. The
twisted wreckage flips through the air toward the concrete-
contained river. Drops onto the cement bank. EXPLODES as
it rolls into the water... As hundred-dollar bills scatter
in the wind, the back seat window of the truck rolls down,
revealing Ku. Ku regards the flaming wreck down the track
amoment. Puts away his prayer beads. Rolls up the
window... As the truck drives off --

RIGGS
Hi, honey.

REVEAL LORNA COLE, nightie, nine millimeter, nine months
pregnant. She lowers the gun.

LORNA
You were coming home last night.

RIGGS
Had some bad Chinese.

As they continue, we see the place has been transformed.
Additions, wings, decks, etc. open out from the old trailer.
A woman's touch everywhere. Their two dogs and one cat
greet Riggs and vice versa. Lorna sees how dirty and
banged up he is.

LORNA
You okay?

RIGGS
Better than Roger. His boat sank.

He feeds the dogs some fries.

LORNA
Don't feed 'em that junk. What
happened?

RIGGS
Gunfights, sharks, explosions...
The usual.

LORNA

«+. You were out fishing. Does
trouble just go looking for you?

RIGGS
No, it seems to know pretty much

Riggs sees into a newly-added room.

Hope you like doggies, baby.

Beat. Riggs spins a mobile over the crib.

RIGGS
Lorna... We... We've never talked
about... marriage.

Lorna looks up at him. It could be a hopeful look.

LORNA
I sorta figured you didn't want
that... You want to get married?
RIGGS
Well... No.
LORNA

Whew. Me, either. Want breakfast?
RIGGS

re: fast food)
Got mine.

INT. LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN 35

Lorna emerges, goes to the kitchen. Riggs follows her
out. The DOGS are BARKING at the door.

RIGGS
You guys want to go out? C'mon.

He opens the door, lets the dogs out.

EXT. RIGGS' TRAILER A35

LORNA
Not now. Nothing comes between a

RIGGS

Have I ever made your ‘womanhood
reach peaks that would rival the
highest Himalayas'?

LORNA
The foothills of Malibu maybe.
No Everests.

RIGGS
Thanks a lot.

LORNA
Just kidding. I've been to lots
of mountaintops with you, Riggs.

EXT. RIGGS' TRAILER - LITTLE LATER B35

Riggs and Lorna are eating. Riggs keeps feeding the
dogs surreptitiously.

LORNA
I dropped by Internal Affairs
yesterday. Y'know, to say hi.

Overheard one thing at the office.
RIGGS
What?
LORNA

I.A.'s got an anonymous tip... The
person said Roger's on the take.

RIGGS

Roger? That's crazy.
LORNA

Of course it is. It's someone
with a grudge against him.
Probably some jerk he put away...
But with the new boats all the
time and putting two kids through
private college, it's caused
conversation. Anyway, I thought
you should know. I'1l tell you
if it goes anywhere.

RIGGS
«+. Straight-arrow Rog on the
take. That'd be the day.

LORNA
Just don't tell him, okay? He'll
blow his top, and I'll be in hot
water. And he's got enough
problems as it is anyway.

RIGGS
Like what?

LORNA

daughters going out with cops.

RIGGS
He'd kill ‘em. Yeah? So?

LORNA
So Rianne's married to one. He's
the father of her baby. She's too
scared to tell Roger.

RIGGS
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up...
Rianne's married?

LORNA
To a cop. They met last year.
They fell in love. She got
pregnant. They got hitched.

RIGGS
And no one's telling Rog.

LORNA
After the baby's born.

RIGGS
‘Here's the whole package, take it
or leave it'?

LORNA
I'm not saying it was a good idea.

RIGGS
It's a good idea if you want to
see Rog's head explode... What

Rog.

LORNA
You cannot tell him, Riggs.

RIGGS
You kidding? He'd shoot me for
being the messenger... Question is

how to have fun with it.

LORNA
This is serious. Don't screw
around.

RIGGS

No. Right. No screwing around.
I mean, Rog is my best friend.
It'd be wrong to mess with him.

But we know what that smile means...

INT. MURTAUGH'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY 36

Riggs and Lorna enter as Murtaugh comes down the stairs.
Murtaugh's a little flustered, in a hurry to leave.

MURTAUGH
Hey.

RIGGS
Hey, Rog, we were just discussing
baby names. You know which ones
Rianne's thinking about?

MURTAUGH
(it hurts him)
Oscar for a boy. Loreen for a
girl.

RIGGS
«+. She couldn't come up with
anything butter, I mean, better?

Lorna surreptitiously jabs him.

LORNA
I think they're nice.

MURTAUGH
Don't get me started. C'mon,
let's go, Riggs.
(to Lorna)
Trish'll be right down. Have fun
shopping for baby junk.

Riggs glances into the living room -- on the floor are
sleeping bags, etc. Murtaugh enters from the kitchen,
a little flustered, in a hurry.

RIGGS
Who had the sleep-over?

MURTAUGH
Uh, we're airing out the camping
gear. We're outta here.

LORNA
Something smells good.

MURTAUGH
Trish has food on the stove.

As he kisses her goodbye, a small Chinese boy peeks out
from the kitchen door. Makes eye contact with Riggs.
And disappears. Murtaugh hasn't seen him.

MURTAUGH
Let's go, Riggs.

RIGGS
You know, that smells a lot like
Chinese food.

MURTAUGH
.». Yeah, Trish has been trying
that lately. Who knew she could
wok fry?

RIGGS
I'd like to taste it.

MURTAUGH
We don't have time --

But Riggs is already heading for the kitchen. Murtaugh
hurries to stop him.

MURTAUGH
No.

RIGGS
C'mon, Rog, we're early.

He starts to go. Murtaugh stops him again.

MURTAUGH
Riggs... There's a Chinese person
in the kitchen... A couple people,
actually... Sort of a family...

Riggs opens the kitchen door. REVEAL the Chinese people
from the lifeboat inside cooking food.

MURTAUGH
.+. A large family.

Riggs, Lorna, and Murtaugh enter.

MURTAUGH

lifeboat... After what the I.N.S.

for ‘em.

RIGGS
So you brought ‘em home.

MURTAUGH
Took two trips.

The little boy's fascinated by Riggs. Stares at him.

MURTAUGH
That's Ping.

Murtaugh goes to a forty-ish MAN.

MURTAUGH
This is Hong. He's head of the
family. Speaks pretty good
English... Hong, this is my
partner, Martin Riggs. And this
is Lorna.

HONG
Wife?

RIGGS /LORNA/MURTAUGH

Riggs drags him out. Lorna eyes the Chinese food.
LORNA

Laundry, food... What is it this

NICK

You believe they talk to their
father this way?

CARRIE
Dad, it costs a little more to be
a college student than when you
were going.

MURTAUGH
You think I don't know that? I
get the tuition bills. Get the
grades, too. And right now, I'm
not getting much cluck for my
buck... And when I was in school, I
had a job. You know what that is?

MURTAUGH

Yeah, well, I got other things on
my mind at the moment, so what I'm
gonna do is give you the money
now, and then fight with you about
it later.

Murtaugh reaches into his pocket, pulls out a large wad
of cash. Riggs is surprised by the size of the roll. As
Murtaugh doles it out to Nick and Carrie --

MURTAUGH
Consider this a down payment on a
future ass-chewing.
CARRIE
(to Nick)
Told you we should've asked Mom.
They head out. Murtaugh calls after them --
MURTAUGH
I want to see some grades this
term, too.
Murtaugh puts away the wad.
RIGGS
Pretty big roll there, Rog...
Anyway, back to the Chinese --

MURTAUGH
I've made up my mind about it.

RIGGS
What for?

MURTAUGH
Didn't say... C'mon. Gotta go,
Riggs.

Riggs has a pair of chopsticks. Hands Ping an orange.
Indicates for Ping to toss it in the air. Ping does...
Riggs catches it with the chopsticks. Uses them to toss
it back in the air. Changes his grip on the chopsticks.
Spears the orange as it falls. Skewers it. Hands it
back to Ping. Gets another big smile for it. He gives
Lorna another peck, she mumbles goodbye, and then --

INT. MURTAUGH'S FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER 40
Heading for the door. Murtaugh's still worried.
MURTAUGH
Maybe someone saw me with the
Hongs. Maybe the captain knows.

Ku takes out the glasses, gives them to the oldest Four
Father. As he does this, we see him also remove the
lining to the case, and out of sight of the guards, pull
out a bill of Chinese currency for the men to see... The
bill's normal in all respects, except that where the
portraits should be, there's only blank space... Having
shown it to them, Ku then slides it back inside the
lining of the case. Beat.

NG
We're short, but there's lots of
us. What can I do for you?

RIGGS
Ship's crew shot one of the
illegals. Apparently acted on
orders. Asian Crimes know who's
smuggling Chinese these days?

NG
There's no hard evidence. We're
pretty sure the big boss is a
guy named Benny Chan.

MURTAUGH
Uncle Benny?

NG
You know him?

RIGGS

Had some dealings with him. Back
then he was moving smack.

MURTAUGH
Never nailed him on that, either.

NG
Benny's slippery.

RIGGS
Where's he hanging out these days?

NG
He's got a nightclub, couple

Riggs waves him over. When he's there --

RIGGS
Ever hear of Benny Chan?

BUTTERS
No.

MURTAUGH

Big-time crime boss in Chinatown.

RIGGS
If it's bad, and it's Chinese,
Benny's running it. Asian Crimes
thinks he's behind the smuggling
operation.

BUTTERS
Where do I find him?

RIGGS

BUTTERS
Yes, sir, I do.

RIGGS
Any particular reason?

BUTTERS

About a hundred fifty thousand of
‘em. That's how many bullets were
zinging around my neighborhood
growing up. Couldn't go outside
half the time. Couldn't be near
a window. Grew up on the floor.
Slept on the floor, ate on the
floor, watched T.V. on the floor.
Hell, I didn't learn to walk 'til
I was ten. Spent my formative
years nose to nose with the family
beagle... I'm working a crime, I'm
thinking about that goddamn floor.

And it pisses me off.

 

 

Riggs sees something in the rearview mirror.

RIGGS
Did we tell Leo to meet us
somewhere?

MURTAUGH
No, why?

RIGGS

‘Cause he's following us, five

Butters right behind him. Murtaugh last, calling --

MURTAUGH
No damage, Riggs! Remember the
insurance!... Shit!
EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT B54

Riggs leads Butters and Murtaugh down the street in
pursuit of the two men.

The men cut across a street, dodge cars to the far side.

Two CARS COLLIDE in front of Riggs. He doesn't break
stride. Makes a Starsky and Hutch hood-slide over one
of the cars and keeps going.

Murtaugh, meanwhile, has been overtaken by Butters, who
takes another angle on the fleeing suspects and dodges
cars across the busy street. Murtaugh knows he can't
keep up. Looks around. Sees a young man on a
restaurant delivery bike. Pulls out his wad of cash.

MURTAUGH
Two hundred for the bike. Fifty
for the food.

Murtaugh hops on and pedals away.

The suspects bang into people as they run up the
sidewalk. Riggs and Butters weave through behind them.
Murtaugh wheels along in traffic, catching up.

EXT. SUN YAT SEN PLAZA AS55

The two bad guys turn in. Riggs and Butters on their

surprised to see him on the bike.

EXT. CHINATOWN MALL A56

The Captain runs into a glass-walled exterior elevator
just as the doors are closing. Murtaugh SKIDS up a beat
later. The doors close in his face. Riggs sees this.
Spots a flight of stairs. Uses a bench and a moving
cart to vault to the first landing, heads for level two.

Murtaugh dumps the bike, takes an alternate route using
an exterior escalator.

INT. ELEVATOR B56

The Captain looks out the glass back of the elevator and
sees Riggs bounding up the stairs behind him. Realizes
Riggs will make the top about the same time. Sees the
elevator next to his going down. In desperation, pulls
his GUN and BLOWS OUT the side WINDOW. Other people in
the elevator scream in terror as he climbs out the
window and leaps onto the top of the descending elevator.

Riggs reacts to this and must now run back down a flight
and leap over the railing. In front of him, only yards
away, the Captain jumps from the elevator. He lands,
losing his gun, then gets up and takes off again with
Riggs in pursuit.

Murtaugh, meanwhile, seeing what's happened, has reached
a landing and now must turn and go down the "up"
escalator. Shouts at the people in front of him.

MURTAUGH
Look out! Out of the way!

Murtaugh reaches level ground, jumps on the bike again,

and takes off.

entrance directly below the window.

EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT B60
The man jumps from the second floor. Just as he hits

EXT. CHINATOWN ROOFTOPS B63

They run across the roofs. Take one or two small jumps
..-. when a "seventeen"-foot span looms ahead.

The Captain leaps. Makes the rooftop of the building
on the other side.

Murtaugh pedals along, watching from below. Screams for
Riggs not to do it, but... we know Riggs. He plants.
Pushes off. Launches himself through the air... Hits
hard on the other side, off-balance. Starts slipping
backwards and slides off the edge. Barely catches the
ornate corner of the roof and is left hanging there.
Murtaugh yells from below --

MURTAUGH

But Riggs is still struggling to hoise himself up and
resume the chase. Urging himself on --

Murtaugh's helping him out of the ring. Sotto --

He sags against the wall, winded, in pain.

MURTAUGH
Better ice that shoulder.

RIGGS
My shoulder's okay.

MURTAUGH
Don't be brave.

RIGGS
The shoulder's not hurt, Rog. I
was faking it.

MURTAUGH
You were faking it?

RIGGS
Gomez was killing me. I didn't
have anything left.

Murtaugh starts undressing.

MURTAUGH
Told you he was good.

RIGGS
-+. It wasn't all him.

Riggs moves to a bench and sits down. Beat.

RIGGS
I've been feeling it lately, Rog.
.»+. I mean, that guy nailed me on
the ship, right? Then yesterday,
trying to catch him... And there's
been other stuff... Figured I was
just out of shape or something.
But it's more than that. It's
like --

MURTAUGH
You're too old for this shit?

Murtaugh's doffing his sweat pants, when Butters appears.

BUTTERS
Hey, how's it going?

Murtaugh hauls up his sweats. Butters continues through.

RIGGS
Murphy's right. We're
dinosaurs... I need your help

here, Rog. What am I gonna do?
Murtaugh sees Riggs needs him. Sits.

MURTAUGH
Only thing you can do. Accept it.

RIGGS
I've always done the job one way.
All the way. It's all I know.

MURTAUGH
You'll do it a different way.

Oh yeah? Like how?

It wasn't my dog. It was a P.I.
job I was working.

MURTAUGH
A dog hired you?

LEO
People hired me. To find a
missing dog.

RIGGS
Big case.

LEO
This was an expensive Bolshoy,
funny guy.

MURTAUGH
Borzoi.

LEO

Whatever, whatever...

MURTAUGH
And you found it.

LEO
Sort of. See, I figured out
my fee for finding it'd be more
than the cost of the dog from
the pound, right? So --

You got a Borzoi from the pound
and convinced the people it was
their little Rover.

LEO

He quickly turns away, acts busy with something as
Butters walks up.

BUTTERS
Captain Riggs. Captain Murtaugh.

Murtaugh turns, reacts to Butter's closeness.

RIGGS
What is it, Bundles?

BUTTERS
Just heard from the Crime Lab.
Guy you chased through Chinatown?
The gun he dropped matched the
slugs from those bodies at the
ship. He's the shooter.

RIGGS

phone company wants. Know why?

At which point, Leo reveals himself.

Leo makes

LEO

Because they fuck you with cell
phones. Okay? They fuck you
with cell phones. They want you
to get cut off, ‘cause then, when
you call the people back, they
can charge you the higher rate

again.

 

 

BUTTERS
If your fucking three-hour
battery that lasts only twenty
minutes isn't fucking dead.

LEO
And if you're not behind a little
fucking hill where all you get
is --

 

the sound of bad static.

BUTTERS
Not to mention, the phones're
getting smaller and smaller.
Why? So they can fit more
places? No, no. So they can be
lost or stolen easier. So you
have to buy a new one, and they
can fuck you again there. Ever
lost a plug-in phone at your
fucking house? Ever had someone
break in your fucking home and
steal that big kitchen phone off
the wall?

What do you care if I want to go
home and change my shirt?

RIGGS
Coffee stain's just not something
that'd bother me.

MURTAUGH
Look how you dress.

RIGGS
What's that supposed to mean?
Because I'm not sporting those

expensive suits?... Not many cops
are.
MURTAUGH
... What's that supposed to mean?
RIGGS
(so the cops don't

Means I don't understand where all
the money's coming from.

The cruiser pulls over. Riggs and Murtaugh get out,
thanking the cops, who drive off.

MURTAUGH
Wonder who that was?

Riggs regards two cars parked in front of the house with Lorna's
Explorer and Rianne's Pontiac: a black four-door
Mercedes and a new, black Continental.

RIGGS
Whose cars are these?

Riggs and Murtaugh hold a look.

INT. MURTAUGH'S FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER A81

Murtaugh enters from outside, alone, nonchalant. Trish,
Rianne and Lorna are there.

MURTAUGH
Hey. Whose van was that?

Five Chinese thugs, including Chu and Yee, suddenly
appear from hiding. Guns on Murtaugh, guns on the girls.
As Murtaugh's disarmed --

LORNA
They took the Hongs. They're
gonna kill us.

Murtaugh looks up to see Wah Sing Ku reveal himself at
the top of the stairs.

MURTAUGH
What the hell're you doing here?

At which point, one of the thugs sees a red laser dot on
his nose... REVEAL Riggs, outside the back window, his
9mm in one hand, Murtaugh's ankle gun in the other. The
two thugs he has the drop on surrender their guns. The
rest follow suit. Lorna grabs a gun as Murtaugh gets
his back and draws down on Ku. Riggs enters.

RIGGS
What have we here?

MURTAUGH
They took the Hongs. And look
who's on the stairs, Uncle Benny's
friend.

Riggs moves around to see Ku.

MURTAUGH
Where the hell'd you take ‘em?

A thug makes his move. Flicks open an ice-pick stiletto
as he grabs Lorna. Presses the point to her pregnant
belly. Riggs is instantly compliant.

RIGGS
Okay... Take it easy...

He drops his gun. Murtaugh drops his. The guy with the
knife relaxes... when suddenly, Lorna arch-stomps him.
Elbows him through the kitchen doorway. Slams the pocket
door on his knife arm. Takes the knife. Jams it through
the door, inches from the guy's face. And all hell
breaks loose...

CONTINUED: A81

Everybody's going for the pile of guns on the floor.
Riggs has three guys to contend with. Guys with good
kung fu. Riggs is at his outer limits. Kicks and
punches and bites and scratches and nut-crushes.

Murtaugh's got one guy after him. The guy's swinging a
standing lamp. Murtaugh's about to hit him with a
porcelain bowl, when Trish yells --

TRISH
Not the bowl.

Murtaugh puts it down, dispatches with a body slam
against a wall.

Ku just watches from the stairs, eyes glued to Riggs as
he fights off his three. Ku seeing what kind of stuff

Riggs has, how good he is... until Riggs suddenly has a
gun in his hand. About to swing it up... when Ku drops
down through the stairwell... He can fly?... In a series

of stunning moves, Ku disarms Riggs, and sweeps up the
pistol. Pops up with it as Murtaugh pops up with his
gun, and Riggs pops up again with his own Beretta. Two
guns against one. Beat. Ku surrenders his. Another
beat. Relief... And then Ku does something truly
amazing. Fast as a bolt of lightning... reaches for
Riggs' Beretta and in a single move disassembles it.
Riggs is still holding the grip and trigger, but Ku has
the entire barrel and slide mechanism. And he's not
done... Cracks Murtaugh on the wrist with the slide and
disarms him. Next a flying scissors kick. Riggs and
Murtaugh hit the floor... It's over.

INT. MURTAUGH'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER B81

Ku looks on as his men finish binding everyone. Riggs
and Murtaugh wonder whether it'll be bullets in the
head or the quiet work of the stiletto on neck arteries.
It's neither. It's worse... Ku flicks ON a BUTANE
LIGHTER. Turns the flame up high. Reaches for the
curtains, which quickly catch fire. He lights more
curtains. Papers on a desk. A lamp shade. Anything
that burns. Then barks in Chinese to two of his men.

KU
Stay with them until you're sure
they can't get out.

Ku, Yee and Chu go. The remaining two thugs stand guard
as the flames spread. Soon, the house is an inferno.
The smoke's choking. The thugs still don't budge. It
looks like they're going up in flames, too... when they
finally give each other a look, then turn and run out.

Instantly, Riggs and Murtaugh mobilize, trying to get
loose... They can't... Fire's everywhere... when a closet
door under the stairs opens, and Ping emerges. He'd been
hiding. The bad guys missed him... Ping sees everyone

tied up in the living room... His eyes go to the

children's scissors lying on the floor, where he'd been

doing paper cut-outs earlier... Grabs the scissors...

Begins cutting the tape binding Riggs... it's laborious;

the tape's strong, the small, kid's scissors not meant
for heavy-duty cutting... But slowly, the tape gives
way... And then Riggs is loose... Riggs cuts Murtaugh
free. Throws a chair through the front window. Then he
and Murtaugh move Ping and the women out, not bothering
to untie them.

Riggs pulls Murtaugh away from the sight of his burning
house. Getting in Rianne's Pontiac, Riggs realizes --

One half of a double-wide mobile home is under tow ahead.
In a lane between the thugs and Riggs and Murtaugh. The
open side of the mobile home is covered by clear plastic
and is closer to Riggs and Murtaugh. The thugs are slowed
on the other, aluminum-clad side of the mobile home by a
car entering from an on-ramp.

RIGGS
Pull up next to that mobile home.

EXT. MOBILE ROOM - MURTAUGH'S POV B92
THROUGH the plastic we can see Riggs and the kung-fu

killer punching and kicking.

BACK IN MOBILE HOME c92

Riggs heaves a side table at the thug. The thug ducks.
The table slams against the plastic.

Riggs tackles the thug. Drives them both into the
plastic. Now, they're fighting in a bowed-out bubble of
Visqueen. Over pavement ripping by at 55 mph below them.
The plastic begins tearing away... Rips loose.

Both men tumble out and --

EXT. FREEWAY Dg92

-- land on the upside-down side table. Slide along the
freeway atop the length of the plastic, still attached to

the moving trailer... And there, on the flipped-over
table skimming over the road, the fight continues... The

the Express bus. For the last second of his life.

Murtaugh speeds up to get the truck driver's attention.
HONKS. Trying to get him to pull over. No luck.

And Riggs isn't just ski-boarding behind the mobile
home, either. The remaining thug has now dropped back
in the Mercedes guns it after him... Riggs is trying to
pull himself toward the mobile home. Sees the Mercedes
about to crush him. Breaks a leg off the table. Hurls
it backward and --

-- THROUGH the thug's WINDSHIELD, where it stops, inches
from the guy's nose. He yanks it through. Goes after
Riggs again... Closes in... He's about to run Riggs
over... when Murtaugh suddenly SLAMS Rianne's CAR against
the flank of the Mercedes. Drives him sideways away from
Riggs.

Murtaugh tries to maneuver the cop car close enough to the
sliding table so that Riggs can climb in, as --

-- the Mercedes now pulls around the other side of
Murtaugh. SLAMS into Murtaugh, driving him towards Riggs,
who gets his feet up just in time to fend the car off.

The thug pulls his PISTOL, FIRES at Murtaugh, who ducks
just in time... And then the thug has a choice: keep
firing or worry about the CHERRY-TOPS approaching fast
from behind. He FIRES one last SHOT, then opts for
saving his ass. Punches it.

Murtaugh maneuvers close to Riggs. Riggs reaches. This
is bad. But the plastic's ripping. Bad's better than
worse... Riggs grabs the sedan... Abandons the table...

won't make it. They almost don't.

The ramp curves around a ten-story glass office
building. The ramp's also under construction... The
thug crashes a barricade. Narrowly misses a worker.

No such luck for Riggs and Murtaugh. They're gonna plow
through the entire Caltrans crew... Murtaugh swerves.
Into a pile of lumber... The car's launched into the air

snags computers and copiers and every other thing as

it ROARS past cubicles... when --

outside on the ramp. Keeps his foot on Murtaugh's.

Your family's here. Now, you
finish the job.

HONG

What kind of job?

KU
No time to talk now.

Ku nods to Chu. As Chu moves to take Hong out, Hong and
the uncle exchange a look that communicates Hong's fear
to the old man. Chung grows worried. To Ku --

CHUNG
Take them to their new homes.
When they're safe, I'll finish.

Whereupon Ku's pent-up frustration and anger explode.
The attack is vicious, swift. The victim slammed
backward across Ku's knee. His neck snapped. Just like
that... And then Hong's dead eyes staring off at
nothing... Ku drops him to the floor. To Chung --

KU
Finish now or watch the others die.

OFF Chung, no choice and Hong dead in front of him --

Murtaugh looks at his wife. Her eyes meet his.

face the PRC General and thirty armed soldiers holding
The Four Fathers. All in suspended animation while a
PRC egghead operates the scanner. The scan's complete.
The egghead signals the bill's good. The General nods
to his men to release the Four Fathers... when we hear

a CAR HORN HONKING "Shave and a haircut." Everyone turns
to see Riggs and Murtaugh driving in. Slowly. Butters,
Ng, and Tony following in their car. The soldiers'
automatics swinging over onto them... Riggs and Murtaugh
stop. Get out. No guns. Nonchalant.

RIGGS
Hi, gang.
MURTAUGH
(tins 'em)
L.A.P.D.

Riggs surveys the situation.

RIGGS
So this is what Uncle Benny meant.
Buying the Four Fathers outta jail.
Which general's out to line his
pockets, I wonder? Speakee English?

PRC GENERAL
What do you want?

Riggs hands over the faceless renminbi.

RIGGS
Need toilet paper back home?
That's all the renminbi's good
for.

As the General checks the renminbi --

MURTAUGH
You can take the Four Pops back
to China. We don't give a shit.

RIGGS
Yeah, do what you want with 'em.
Just don't leave ‘em here.

Whereupon the General pulls a GUN and SHOOTS two Four
Fathers in the head. Fan kills him before he SHOOTS
the oldest Father and the pit viper (Ku's father).
Hits him with a BURST... And all hell breaks loose.

The battle pits the Triad against Riggs, Murtaugh,
Butters, Ng, Tony, and the PRC Army. It rapidly
divides into separate skirmishes that sometimes

overlap. It's a war. Most important, we're counting
the bullets. The PRC guys have, at most, three thirty-
five round mags. In real life, set on full auto, that
goes fast. The Triad guys are slightly less well-armed.
Riggs, Murtaugh, et al have their pistols and a couple
extra mags each. What this means is, as people run out
of ammo, they're first diving after dead guys' guns, and
then they're going to hands and feet and whatever they
can grab to hit with or throw. The gun battle will
transform into a realistic martial arts melee.

During the fight:

Ku's goal's to protect the two remaining Four Fathers
and get them out. In the process, he takes on multiple
opponents, armed and not.

We see the two remaining Four Fathers' martial arts
skills on display.

Riggs suffers an early flesh wound. It slows him but
doesn't stop him.

Tony's killed. Ng and Butters both nail the shooter.

Riggs and Murtaugh end up behind the stack of renminbi.
Out of breath. Nicked here and there. As they check
their ammo --

MURTAUGH
You okay?

RIGGS
Yeah.
(re: the bullet
hole in his side)
Went through and through.

MURTAUGH
Was this a good idea?

RIGGS
It was an idea. One in the
chamber, three in the mag. You?

MURTAUGH
Down to the wheel gun. Six.

A Triad guy appears. Murtaugh SHOOTS him TWICE.

MURTAUGH
Four.

BULLETS RIP the stack of money. Bills float down around
them. Beat. Then --

RIGGS
Trish never mentioned a rich
aunt.

MURTAUGH
Huh?

RIGGS
The one you said died and left
her all the money... I.A.S.
heard you're on the take.

MURTAUGH
I'm on the take?

RIGGS
Sounded crazy to me, too. But
now I don't know what the hell's
going on. Why're you lying to
me, Rog?

Murtaugh looks sick. It must be bad. A long beat.

MURTAUGH
Ever hear of Ebony Clark?

RIGGS
She writes those cheesy sex
novels. Yeah. Why?

MURTAUGH
«+. Trish is Ebony Clark.
RIGGS
Trish? Your wife Trish? Writes

books?

Started a couple years ago. Now
she's a bestseller. Even has her
own line of lingerie. Remember
those shorts with the hearts?
They're from the men's collection
.+. I didn't want people to know.
It's kinda embarrassing.

Beat. More GUNFIRE.

RIGGS
Two shots left.

MURTAUGH
Me, too.

RIGGS

I read some Ebony Clark. Trish

has a pretty vivid imagination.
(then)

It is made-up, isn't it, Rog? I

mean, you guys aren't into all

that... Stuff's kinda kinky,

y'know... Are you?

MURTAUGH
(beat; smiles)
Kids are outta the house these
days.

Beat. Then more GUNFIRE. This time, they're driven
from cover and have to split up.

In the midst of the fighting, Riggs meets Ng.

NG
How we doing?

RIGGS
You got me.

They spot Ku and the pit viper moving by in the distance.

RIGGS
Who's the guy in the white
pajamas?

NG

Name's Wah Sing Ku. The Four
Father with him's his real dad.

RIGGS
Like Four Father like son,
huh?... I'm gonna go see if I

can break up the family.
Riggs heads off in Ku's direction.

Across the room, Murtaugh FIRES TWO of his four... when
a Triad guy he doesn't see draws a bead on him. FIRES
+. And suddenly Butters is there. Knocks Murtaugh
down. Takes the bullet himself. Murtaugh comes off
the ground, POPS the shooter, and moves to Butters.

MURTAUGH
Butters.

BUTTERS
Hey, you said my real name.

The wound shouldn't kill him.

MURTAUGH
Don't move.

BUTTERS
This is the first time I've been
shot. Am I okay?

MURTAUGH
(sees Ng)
Ng!
(indicates Butters)
Watch him.

Ng comes over as Murtaugh moves on. Checks the cylinder
as he goes. One bullet left... when the old Four Father
is there. Drives a kick into Murtaugh's kidneys. A
monkey fist in the neck. Murtaugh fights unconsciousness.
Sees him moving in again. Finds a paint spray gun at
hand. Sees the old man's glasses. Sprays... A pink mist
covers the lenses. The old guy has to take them off.
Losing his glasses doesn't change his kung fu -- it's as
good as ever -- it's just now all his blows're landing
half a foot short. Which Murtaugh realizes. Stays out
of range. Waits for an opening. Then clonks him with
the butt of his revolver.

Riggs FIRES his last two. Meets Chu mano-a-mano...

(CONTINUED)
130

129.

CONTINUED: (6) 130

Chu makes Riggs suffer... when a PRC Army guy appears
and takes Chu out... A moment of acknowledgement between
him and Riggs. Then Ku and his father end the moment.
Strike like a lightning. Ku drops Riggs as the father
kills the soldier... Ku moves to kill Riggs with a punch.

Across the room, Murtaugh sees Ku about to kill Riggs.
Raises his GUN. It's a long shot. Murtaugh pauses.
Cricks his neck. FIRES.

An instinct alerts Ku. He sees Murtaugh fire. Moves just
enough to avoid the slug... Murtaugh keeps pulling the
trigger. The hammer falling on empty chambers... Ku
senses something behind him. Turns to find his father's
taken Murtaugh's slug and bleeds profusely from the hole
it made in his pericardium. Ku moves to him. Catches him
as he falls. Supports him as he heads for a door. Finds
himself engaged by a PRC soldier. Dispatches him despite
the burden of his father's body. And exits.

Murtaugh moves to Riggs. They're both bruised and beat-up.
Exhausted. The battle's basically over. Bodies everywhere.
Murtaugh hoists Riggs to his feet.

MURTAUGH
C'mon.

EXT. NATIONAL ANSCO WAREHOUSE 131

Out on a fucked-up, old pier. Ku supporting his father
as he looks for an escape... when the father sags, drops
to the ground... Ku bends over him. Their eyes meet.
They hold the look for a long time... Father and son...
And then the father's eyes roll back.

A DOOR BANGS OPEN a SHORT DISTANCE AWAY. Riggs and
Murtaugh stumble out of the warehouse. See Ku kneeling
next to the body. Bowed. His brow touching his father's
.-. Ku lifts his head. Sees Riggs and Murtaugh... Ku has
nothing left to live for now. Nothing except to kill the
two men responsible for his failure, for his father's
death... Ku stands. Starts walking toward them. Slowly.
Inexorably.

Riggs and Murtaugh watch as Ku approaches. They're alone.
They're out of bullets. They're shot up, tired, and
generally hurting...

MURTAUGH
Since I met you, I've done a
lotta hairy shit, 'cause somebody
had to back you up. But it ain't

gonna happen now... I'm gonna be
a grandfather, and you and Lorna
are gonna have a baby... He ain't

worth dying for, Riggs.

The two men hold a long look. Beat. SIRENS APPROACH
IN the DISTANCE.

RIGGS
«+. Cavalry's coming, anyway.
And this guy won't get far. We
can always track him down
sometime when we have a

howitzer... Your son-in-law's
in there. Let's get him and
get out.

Murtaugh's not a little relieved. They turn, start off.

RIGGS
We're too old for this shit.

MURTAUGH
Guy's just too damn good.

RIGGS
Yeah, he took my gun apart, for
Christ's sake. How the hell'd
he do that?

CONTINUED: 131

MURTAUGH
Yeah... How did he?

They keep walking... Two more steps. Then stop. Look at
each other. It's a long look. Murtaugh sighs...

MURTAUGH
Yeah, okay, let's go ask him.

They turn back. Start walking toward Ku. Ku keeps
coming... The distance closes... Then, in English!--

«+ No tomorrow...

And Riggs and Murtaugh charge... Ku knocks them both
down... Then they're up. And the fight's on...

What follows goes beyond what we've seen so far. Ku has
the skill; Riggs and Murtaugh have the heart and the will.
Ku's methodical; they're animal, unstructured, spitting,
tearing, howling. And taking massive punishment. When
Ku's about to deliver the death blow to Murtaugh, Riggs
intercedes. Murtaugh does the same for Riggs, barreling
into Ku. Fighting the way a grizzly fights... The
battle's nasty, brutish, and long.

Murtaugh's beaten, a mess... In the end, it's up to
Riggs. To reach deeper into himself than he already has.
To become, despite age and attrition, something he once
was. Insane. For all or zero... Twelve years melt away...
This is the kid who jumped off buildings and killed

Mr. Joshua. The demon-product of an idiotic war and dark
memories and desperation... The Lethal Weapon...

It's not that Riggs is, finally, better than Ku. He's
just switched into a gear Ku isn't expecting. Taking
punishment Ku and we would never think possible...
Driving Ku back. Unleashing all his fury... when
Murtaugh suddenly spears Ku with a piece of steel rebar.
Front to back... Ku knocks Murtaugh unconscious for it...
He'd kill Murtaugh next. If Riggs didn't grab the bar,

a hand on either end, and whip Ku around... Riggs doesn't
let go either. Grips the steel tight, uses it to maneuver
Ku and inflict massive pain... when suddenly, Ku flicks
his foot over his own shoulder and stuns Riggs. And the
two men tumble off the pier...

UNDERWATER A132
Riggs and Ku sink to the bottom, still locked in battle,
lit by the headlights of a car that Chu has driven off

the pier after being shot dead trying to escape...

CONTINUED: A132

The odds shift back into Ku's favor again. He's nailed
Riggs with the kick and now begins to punish him underwater,
not caring if he himself dies, as long as Riggs dies,
too... when Riggs' hand finds an AK-47 inside the car
with Chu. He pulls it out. Sticks it in Ku's belly...

Ku tries to shove the barrel away... And Riggs OPENS UP
on FULL AUTO. GUN flashes light silt-stirred water.

Shell casings eject in SLO-MO through fluid resistance.
And a magazine of AK SLUGS RIP UP Ku's guts... Blood fills
the water. Ku's eyes meet Riggs'. Then his hand releases
the gun barrel. And Ku drifts to the harbor floor...
Riggs doesn't see him hit, though. He's heading topside
for oxygen.

EXT. PIER B132

Riggs breaks the surface. Gasping for air. He's won.
To Ku, somewhere below him!--

RIGGS
No tomorrow for you, asshole.

He swims to a ladder fixed to a piling. Grabs a rung.
Starts to hoist himself out... when Ku explodes up out of
the water. Whips the garrote in his Buddhist prayer
beads over Riggs' head and draws it tight.

The wire bites into Riggs' neck. The weight of Ku's bloody
body pulls on him. Riggs white-knuckles the rung with one
hand, tries to fight Ku off with the other... We see a
ladder begin to pull away from the rotting wood and
concrete of the pier... when Riggs finds the rebar still
sticking through Ku's side and yanks it out... The searing
pain causes Ku to loosen the garrote slightly. Enough for
Riggs to get the rebar wedged inside it. To slide the
rebar up alongside his face and begin to lever the garrote
away from his neck... Slowly, he manages to slide the wire
noose up over his head. And then, in a sudden reversal,
whips the loop off his own head and back over Ku's... The
ladder's hanging by a bolt now... Riggs tightens the
garrote around Ku's neck... As the last bolt holding the
ladder lets go, Riggs whips the garrote around a steel
hook protruding from the ladder's side, and the ladder,
still connected to a large chunk of concrete, drops into
the depths, carrying Ku with it... He won't be coming

back from that one... Whereupon Riggs reaches up for a
piece of concrete and rebar hanging off the pier. Grabs
it... And it breaks away on top of him. And Riggs, too,
is gone. Plunged to the bottom... Not coming up.

On the pier, Murtaugh comes to. Looks around. No one.

MURTAUGH
Riggs...

He drags himself to his feet.

MURTAUGH
Riggs...

Murtaugh moves to the dry dock. Small waves are still
rebounding off the walls. But that's all. No bubbles.
When the waves disappear, it's just still black water.
Murtaugh screams now, looking down into the water.

MURTAUGH
Where are you, Riggs?!

Nothing. Moving along the edge of the dry dock now,
still calling down into the water --

MURTAUGH
Tell me where you are, Riggs!...
Will it to me! Will it to me,

Riggs!... Tell me where you are,
Riggs!... Will it to me! Will
it to me!

Beat. Beat. Murtaugh's eyes suddenly swing to a spot in
the water. Like he's heard something. He runs. A few
strides along the edge. Then dives to the spot.

UNDERWATER 132

Murtaugh swims down... Deeper and deeper... and...

there, next to Ku's dead body and the ladder, is Riggs...
Pinned under the large chunk of concrete and steel.
Breath running out. Desperate eyes bugged, pleading with
Murtaugh... It's hopeless for Murtaugh to try and shift
such an enormous weight. Except that Murtaugh's gonna
try. Gets his hands under the concrete. Plants his feet
on the bottom of the dry dock. Lifts. Strains. Maxes
every fiber in his body. Muscles burning from oxygen
debt... until... the mass slowly begins to move ... More
and more... And then Riggs is free. Murtaugh hauls his
friend up toward the dim moonlight shimmering above them.

EXT. PIER 133

They break the surface. Suck air and choke water.
Alive. Barely. Murtaugh holding Riggs up so he can
breathe. Tears in Murtaugh's eyes as he holds him...

MURTAUGH

you... I heard you...

A banged-up Riggs walks down a row of headstones until he
finally stops. Kneels at a simple marker, just a name and
dates: Victoria Lynn Riggs, 1953-1984. Brushing away
some leaves!--

RIGGS
I haven't been here enough.
Riggs lays a hand on the stone. Closes his eyes... Re-
living memories of the woman he'd loved and wed and
buried... Stays that way a long time. Then opens his eyes
again.
RIGGS

As Leo appears, looking for something... when he sees
Riggs, kneeling at the headstone. Leo stops. Suddenly
uncomfortable. Realizing he's stumbled onto Riggs in a
very private moment. Begins backing away. Steps on a
TWIG. Riggs whirling around at the SNAPPING sound, gun
in hand...

RIGGS
Leo. Jesus. You almost got
yourself shot.

Turns back.

dad was no Crackerjack prize...
Anyway, Froggy didn't turn into
anything, just stayed a frog, but
was still my best friend, and
one day I was carrying his
box in my bike basket, and he
jumped out. My back wheel ran
over him. And he died... I
was heartbroken... I'd never
love another living thing ever
again... Then, about a year
later, the mentally slow guy
in the next apartment, Iggy,
his dog has puppies, and he has
to get rid of 'em, and he asks
me to take the one that didn't
sell. So I do... Pretty soon,
it's my new best friend. I
named him Froggy the Second...
It wasn't that he was a better
pet. Just a different one...
Anyway, I thought maybe it
was relevant.

CAN'T HEAR Riggs, Butters, Murtaugh, and Leo. It's
clear Rianne's just had her baby, too. Congratulations
all around. Then the nurse wheels up the second
isolette, pulls back the blanket... and reveals RIGGS
BABY BOY. OFF the men, looking in, making faces at

the kids --

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - DAY 165
Leo's trying to buy a throw-away camera from a camera
vending machine. The machine keeps rejecting his

rumpled dollar bills.

165 CONTINUED: 165

LEO
Two families with babies, and
nobody thinks to bring a camera?

REVEAL Riggs, Lorna, and their baby, and Murtaugh,
Trish, Nick, Carrie, Butters, Rianne, and their baby.
Lorna and Rianne are in wheelchairs.

RIGGS
C'mon, Leo.

MURTAUGH
Yeah, hurry up, Leo.

LEO
I'm hurrying.

The machine rejects another bill.

LEO
Argh... You got one little
wrinkle in a dollar... I hate

machines. Know why? Okay.
Because machines always fu --

MURTAUGH/RIGGS
Leo.

LEO
Okay, okay, whatever, whatever...

Captain Murphy enters carrying two presents.

RIGGS
Hey, Captain.

MURTAUGH
What're you doing here?

MURPHY
Came to offer my congratulations.

He takes the presents to Rianne and Lorna.

MURPHY
Little something from the squad.

RIGGS
Anything for us?

MURPHY
Matter of fact, yeah.

He takes two badges out of his jacket.

CONTINUED: (2) 165

MURPHY
Gimme those Captain badges back.
You're sergeants again.

MURTAUGH
What about the insurance?

MURPHY

City's decided to self-insure.
We're spared having you in command
any longer.

(to Murtaugh)
By the way, you owe the Chief one.
Went to bat for you with the I.N.S.
They're granting asylum to that
Chinese family.

Leo finally has the camera.

LEO
I got it. Everybody move in
close... Make sure the flash is

working...

As they all tighten up for the shot, and Leo figures
out the flash, Rianne and Butters exchange a loving
look. She hands him their daughter to hold. Butters
looks at the baby a moment. Then looks at Murtaugh
standing next to him. Extends the baby to Murtaugh.
Murtaugh looks at Butters. The cop who took his
daughter. The one thing Murtaugh didn't want. Reach-
ing out to Murtaugh. Offering the baby, but asking
for something more. Acceptance... It's a yes...
Murtaugh takes the bundle from Butters. Cradles his
granddaughter.

RIGGS
Today, Leo.

LEO
Okay, okay, I got, I got it.

RIGGS
Get in here, Captain.

Murphy moves to join the group. Leo tries to get
everybody in frame.

BUTTERS
Don't cut any heads off.

MURTAUGH
Yeah, back up, Leo. Make sure
you get everybody in.

(CONTINUED)

165 CONTINUED: (3) 165

Leo backs up.

RIGGS
Back, back...

BUTTERS
Back...

MURTAUGH
Back...

Whereupon Leo's backed through a set of automatic
hospital doors, which now slam in his face.

LEO
Argh...

The doors re-open.

LEO
I coulda put out my goddamn eye.

He hands the camera to a passing HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE.

LEO
Here. You take the picture.

Leo moves over to join the group. The Hospital Employee
looks them over, directing them --

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
Closer... Move in on this side...
(checks viewfinder)
That's great.
(then, looking up)
You're all friends?

RIGGS
We're all family.

The Hospital Employee aims the camera.

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
Okay. On three.

At which Riggs and Murtaugh exchange a look.

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
One... two... three...

CONTINUED: (4) 165

FLASH. And WE FREEZE... On twelve faces that will
smile those smiles on their family picture shelves
forever... A dozen people we've grown to love. People
we hate to say goodbye to... But it's that time... And
so, off them, all together, frozen in time, we...

FADE OUT.
