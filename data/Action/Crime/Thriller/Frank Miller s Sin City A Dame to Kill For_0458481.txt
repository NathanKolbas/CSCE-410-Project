BLACK

We hear the opening bars of a song, played most
proficiently on a keyboard. It is rousing, like an
overture.

TITLES BEGIN as we...

FADE IN:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - ENGLISH SEASIDE TOWN - AFTERNOON

-.on JON (20s) leaving work for the day. He looks
sweet, diffident. He walks quite enthusiastically down
the street.

JON (V.O.)
(Singing)

Goodbye work

It's time to go home

Through my town.

He’s evidently composing in his head as he goes.

Jon turns the corner onto the SEAFRONT.

EXT. SEAFRONT - CONTINUOUS
Jon's P.O.V: CHILDREN play on the sand.

JON (V.O.)
(Singing)

Children building

Castles in the sand

In my town.

Jon passes a POSTER advertising a gig.
JON (V.O.)
(Singing)
A band's playing tomorrow night
In my town.
They're called...
Jon looks at the band’s NAME. It is a JUMBLE OF LETTERS.
JON (V.0.)
(Attempting to sing)
.--The Soronprfbs

A BUS passes. Jon runs after it.

INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER

Jon sits on the top deck, looking out. He spots some
DRUNK TRAMPS being ignored by passing BUSINESSMEN.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
The song mutates into something new.

JON (V.O.)
(Singing)
Drunk tramps
Ignored by businessmen
They walk right by you
Don't even notice you
But you're the special ones

The music abruptly stops.

JON
(Murmuring)
No. Too... shit.

EXT. JON’S SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

Jon's commute home is almost at an end. He trudges up the
hill, passing identical suburban houses.

A new song starts. This one sounds rather good.

JON (V.O.)
(Singing)
I dream of an angel
To take me away
I dream of an angel
To take me away

A cautiously excited look crosses Jon's face as he opens
his FRONT DOOR. Could this song be the one?

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jon hurries upstairs.

JON (V.O.)
(Singing)
I dream of an angel
To take...

JON'’S MUM
(Calling from the
kitchen)
Hi, sweetheart. How was work?

JON
(As he hurries
upstairs)
Don’t talk to me. I’ve got an idea
for a song.

JON'’S MUM
Oh mum. Shut your mouth.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
JON
If you talk to me I might forget
the song.
JON'’S MUM

I only asked how work was.

JON
Just let me concentrate on this
song I’ve got in my head before I
forget it.

JON’S MUM
Well I’m sure if it’s good it’ll
withstand a little small talk with
your mother.

INT. JON’'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A typical suburban bedroom. Cool music festival posters
on the wall.

Jon hurries over to his KEYBOARD, sits down and raises
his hands to play. His hands freeze, mid-air.

He's forgotten the song.
JON
(Murmuring)
Shit.

He stands, walks over to his computer and pulls up
TWITTER.

JON (V.O.)
(As he types)
Working on songs.

Jon's twitter following is 49.

TITLES END

I/E. OFFICE BUILDING - THE NEXT MORNING

There’s no music now - just traffic noise.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Jon sits at his workstation. He seems to be in marketing.
INT. CAFE - DAY

Jon waits for his order. It’s a noisy place - CUSTOMERS

ordering, the CLATTER of cutlery.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Beneath the noises we can just discern the sound of the
radio playing on a shelf - the drone of a local station
interview.

Something CATCHES JON’S ATTENTION - something coming from
the radio?

He leans a little closer, trying to hear whatever the
sound is - a kind of keening wail? A series of abrupt,
violent exclamations? The sound of something smashing?
Someone yelling?

CAFE LADY
(Calling)
Cheese and ham panini for Jon?
JON?
On the radio we just catch a distant shout of...

WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
---cunt!

Jon stares at the radio, wondering if he could have heard
that correctly. The Local DJ sounds a little stunned
himself.

LOCAL DJ (0.S.)
That was, that was The...

The DJ attempts the same sound Jon made when trying to
pronounce the band’s name. And also fails.

LOCAL DJ (0.S.) (CONT'D)
And ...I can only apologize.

Jon looks quizzically at the radio. Then he takes his
panini.

EXT. SEAFRONT - LATE AFTERNOON

Jon sits on a bench.

At the other end of the bench a WOMAN reads GRAZIA
magazine. Jon looks at the cover. It’s something about
Nicole Scherzinger.

Jon pulls out his phone and types into TWITTER.

JON (V.0.)
Nicole Scherzinger hashtag yawn.

His number of twitter followers has gone down to 47. He
frowns.

He becomes aware of some drama occurring on the beach. A

PARAMEDIC CREW rushes towards some kind of commotion in
the water.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Jon gets up and - along with other PASSERS-BY - walks
over to get a closer look.

A MAN is trying to DROWN HIMSELF in the water.
Two POLICE OFFICERS attempt to coax him out.

BEARDED MAN
(Yelling)
No! I’m no coming out! Leave me
alone!

Three figures stand watching from a slight distance,
their backs to us. Although we don’t know them yet they
are NANA, CLARA and JEAN BARAQUE.

Jon finds himself beside a parked VAN. A concerned-
looking Californian surfer-type stands next to it. This
is DON TEAGUE.

The two glance at each other, nod, Jon with a “what
happened?” raise of his eyebrows.

DON
We were at this radio station and,
he and Clara had a row or, I don’t
know, I guess ...physical fight?
Next thing...

He indicates the water. Jon's gaze shifts to the VAN.
Written on the side of it is the JUMBLE OF LETTERS that
comprise the band’s name.

JON
You're The...

He gamely tries out the sound.

JON (CONT'D)
You're playing tonight.

DON
How? Our keyboard player is trying
to drown himself.

The EMERGENCY SERVICES wade into the sea. Jon scratches
his face. A beat.

JON
I play keyboards.

Silence. Jon looks worried he sounded opportunistic.

JON (CONT'D)
I mean I'd never...

He indicates the tormented man.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

DON
(Somberly)
You're in.

JON
(Beat)
But I don’t know any of your
songs.

DON
Wait there.

Don climbs into the mysterious darkness of the van. We
hear a murmured conversation. Don reemerges.

DON (CONT'D)
Can you play C, F and G?

JON
Yes?

DON
You're in.

Jon looks a little stunned.

JON
So what... what do we do now?

Don turns back to the beach again, watches with profound
sadness as the paramedics load the man onto a stretcher
and begin to carry him off the beach. One more fallen
comrade.

JON (CONT'D)
Should we run through the
songs... Or...?

DON
(Still watching)
Come to the stage door at 9pm.

JON
Great! I’1ll give you my number
in case anything...

Jon scribbles it down on a piece of paper. Don walks
away to the water’s edge. Jon scuttles over and
practically prises the paper into Don’s hand.

JON (CONT'D)
So. Stage door. 9pm.

He throws one last look into the van, wondering who the
hell’s in there, and then heads off.
EXT. SEAFRONT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Jon has wound his way up from the beach, just as the
paramedics are loading the half-drowned keyboard player
into the ambulance. For a moment the two men lock eyes.
For an unnerving moment it seems as if THE DROWNED MAN IS
TRYING TO TELL JON SOMETHING - as if sensing some link?
Then he’s gone. Jon stares at the closing doors of the
ambulance.

JON
(Beat)
Is he going to be ok?

PARAMEDIC
He'll be fine.

JON
(Suddenly worried)
He'll still need to spend the
night in hospital though, right?
PARAMEDIC
He swallowed a lot of seawater.
He'll have to have his stomach
pumped.
JON
(Relieved)
Plus I suppose there’ll be a whole
suicide risk assessment thing.

The paramedic looks faintly disgusted at Jon, climbs into
the ambulance. Jon watches as it drives away.

EXT. STAGE DOOR - 9PM

Jon is politely knocking.

JON
Hello?

Nothing. Jon looks at his watch. 9pm.

Jon knocks harder. The door creaks open. He nervously
enters.

INT. BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jon walks down the corridor and finds himself in a
grimy dressing room. There’s no one there.

JON
Hello?

Jon looks around.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

On the table there’s a SCRATCHING STICK with a very
long, curved arm. There’s also some bottles of beer,
one with an EXTREMELY long straw sticking out of it.

Jon frowns, perplexed.

Suddenly we hear a STRANGE BANGING NOISE from inside
the hall. It sounds like someone is repeatedly hitting
something.

Jon pauses, listens, puzzled. He realizes - this must
be the band. He walks towards...

INT. WINGS - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Jon watches from the shadows.
ON STAGE

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN is repeatedly banging some kind of
BIZARRE PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT. This is NANA.

A very YOUNG MAN stands playing bass. This is JEAN
BARAQUE.

A furious looking woman stands provocatively at the
front of the stage, eating a pear. She tosses it aside
and stalks over to an odd, vast contraption covered in
knobs and dials and a MAD JUMBLE of coloured wires - an
early-1970s analog synthesizer. This is CLARA.

She eats the pear, tosses it aside and raises her hands
over the dials. She begins to play. Together they’re
making an EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL collection of sounds.

The audience watch this odd trio uncertainly, waiting for
something to happen.

And out of the darkness of the wings someone Jon hadn’t
noticed emerges...

He’s doing a weird jerking, shuffling dance to the
music. Strangest of all - he’s wearing a large FAKE
HEAD, with a SMILING FACE painted onto it. This is
FRANK.

Jon and the audience gawp at the strange apparition
dancing across the stage before disappearing into the
shadows of the opposite wings. Then he wheels around
and dances back on.

Jon becomes aware that Don is standing next to him in
the wings.

They look at each other for a moment. Then Don gently
pushes Jon onto the stage.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Frank, Nana and Baraque ignore him, playing
relentlessly on. Clara glares at him but doesn’t move.

Jon stands there, not sure what to do next. Then he
notices a BATTERED OLD KEYBOARD set up near the back.
He walks over, stares down at it.

CLOSE ON JON’S FACE - a faint frown, thinking stopped.

Almost by itself, his hand reaches out and he begins to
play - just a little three note figure. And it fits.

As the song begins to swell, Jon’s other hand joins the
first and he begins to play along.

Then Frank lifts the mic he’s holding and begins to
sing - and it’s one of the strangest sounds you could
imagine. Beautiful and ridiculous at the same time.

Jon is lost in the ecstacy of the moment - the
realization of a dream.

Then it is abruptly over. The audience are staring in
silence, unsure what just happened - not that any of the
band are paying them any attention anyway.

Clara has noticed FLAMES licking out the back of her
synthesiser. More irritated than alarmed, she uses an old
scorched towel to beat out the flames, burning her hand
in the process.

Across the stage, Baraque has already begun the bass line
to the next song.

CLARA
What are you doing?

Baraque continues playing.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Stop. Will you...

Clara throws a can of WD40 at him. It hits his face.

BARAQUE
(In French,
subtitled)
Now I will have a bruise.

CLARA
Good. Something to look at on your
otherwise nothing face.

Baraque indicates the AUDIENCE.
BARAQUE
(In French,
subtitled)
(MORE )

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED: (2)
BARAQUE (CONT'D)
Now they see what you’re like. So
joyless. So angry.

Baraque storms off stage.

Clara kicks her synthesiser to the floor where it lies,
fizzing and sparking faintly, and stalks off through the
opposite wings.

Nana gives a resigned sigh, picks up her sticks and
leaves the stage as well.

For a moment it’s JUST JON AND FRANK, standing in front
of the nonplussed audience.

Jon looks uncertainly at the strange singer and Frank
turns his great head to look at Jon - as if seeing him
for the first time.

Then Clara is marching back on-stage. She takes Frank by
the hand and leads him away.

Leaving Jon alone.

EXT. VENUE - STAGE DOOR - EVENING

The band are finishing loading equipment into the van, in
a cold, angry silence. There is no sign of Frank. He must
already be in the van.

No-one pays any attention to Jon, who stands watching as
they all climb in and drive off without him.

INT. JON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jon lies in bed, tweeting on his phone.
JON (V.O.)
(Typing) .
Played keyboards with The...
Jon has forgotten the name of the band.
JON (V.O.)
.-.-with a band tonight. Enjoyed
working with them a lot.

INT. JON’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Jon is miserably watching BREAKFAST TV. The keyboard
catches his eye. He walks over and starts to play.

He tries to remember the weird, wonderful melody from
the night before. He gets a few notes right but then

loses his way, the whole thing fading already, like a
dream...

(CONTINUED)
11.
CONTINUED:

He stumbles on for a little longer but then gives up.

EXT. STREET - MORNING

A miserable Jon walks to work. He doesn’t compose a song.

INT. OFFICE - LATER

Jon looks bored. Has gazes out of the window. He
doesn’t compose a song. His phone rings.

JON
Hello?

DON (V.O.)
It’s me. So Lucas got out of the
hospital and begged Clara to let
him back in the band but she
told him to lick her ass.

JON
Uh...

DON (V.O.)
So we need a keyboard player.
And Frank said “Remember that
grateful looking boy who jumped
up onto the stage last week

uninvited.”
JON
(Beat)
I wasn’t uninvited. You invited
me.
DON (V.0.)

Frank said he thought you
brought something cherishable
that night. He can sound pretty
muffled under the head and so
the rest of us thought he said
you brought something
perishable. Like food that
decays easily. Fish or fruit. So
we all said, “Come on, man,
anyone can do THAT.” But then he
repeated it clearer and we all
agreed to let you join. So. Are

you in?
JON
(Beat)
Yes.
DON (V.O.)
Good.

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

He hangs up. Jon looks shell-shocked. The phone rings
again. Jon answers.

DON (V.O.)
I forgot to tell you where to
meet us.
JON
(Relieved)
I know.
DON (V.O.)

Clacket Lane Services on the M25
at 5pm today. Bring a passport.

EXT. CAR PARK - CLACKET LANE SERVICES - 5PM

Jon is waiting at Clacket Lane. He stares at a wall of
fog and drizzle. Nothing. Will this be another
disappointment? But then two headlights appear, glowing
faintly in the gloom and out of the fog drives the
band’s battered TOUR BUS, come to save us.

Jon watches with a mixture of excitement and
nervousness as the tour bus drives towards him. He
pulls out his phone.

CLOSE on the phone: Twitter.

JON (V.0.)
(As he types)

You would not believe what’s

happening to me right now.

The van pulls up and the door slides open. We can’t see
inside.

JON
(Burbling)
Hi. Hello. I wasn’t sure where
to wait. Clacket Lane’s pretty
labyrinthine, isn’t it?

No answer issues from the van. After a moment Jon
climbs in. The doors close and the van sets off once
more.

INT. TOUR BUS - AFTERNOON

Jon sits in the front beside DON, who compared to the
rest of the band looks reassuringly normal.

Behind Jon sit Nana, Baraque and Clara in all their
compelling, alarming, silent, intense other-
worldliness.

And in the back, still wearing his FAKE HEAD, is Frank.

(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
BARAQUE
(Suddenly, in
French -
subtitled)
I need to go to the toilet.
CLARA
(Furious )
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE AT
CLACKET LANE!

Silence resumes.

EXT. MOTORWAY - AFTERNOON

The bus hurtles through the gloom.

EXT. FERRY PORT - EVENING

A foggy evening. There’s hardly anyone around. The bus
is loading onto a Ferry.

EXT. FERRY PORT - PASSPORT CONTROL HUT - EVENING
Through the fog we see the band showing their passports
to two OFFICERS. They reach Frank. They stare at his
head.

FRANK
I have a certificate.

His accent is American. The officers lead him inside
the hut.

EXT. FERRY - EVENING

The ferry is crossing the North Sea.

Don stands on deck at the rails, smoking. Jon stands
beside him.

JON
Can I ask... where are we going
Don?

DON

We’re going to Sweden, Jon.
JON
(Beat)
Okay.

A pause.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

DON
What do you think of Frank?

JON
Um...

Jon and Don glance over at Frank. He’s sitting on a
bench on deck. Clara is, as always, at his side. Frank
is smoking a cigarette, using a long cigarette holder
that curls under the head’s neckline.

He finishes his cigarette, pulls it out of the holder,
and tosses the butt away. It catches in the North Sea
wind and flies back into his head.

Frank and Clara frantically pat down his ‘face’ to stop
a fire from breaking out.

DON
He's fucking amazing isn’t he?
He lives all the way out there,
man.

Don indicates the infinite, black sea, stretching out
beyond them.

DON (CONT'D)
In the furthest corners. I wanna
be him.

JON
(Beat. Carefully)
Don? Can I ask... the head...?

DON
He never takes it off.

Jon thinks about this, impressed.

JON
Never?

DON
Never.

JON
He sleeps in it?

DON
Yes.

JON

What about eating?

DON
He sucks liquid food through a
straw that he funnels up under
the neckline.

(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED: (2)

JON
What kind of liquid food?
DON
Complan.
JON

He must have a very bushy beard.

DON
Not necessarily.

JON
How does he clean his teeth?

Don sighs.

DON
You're just going to have to go
with this, Jon.

JON
I’m sorry. I’m just... it’s
pretty crazy, isn’t it?

He laughs nervously.

DON
(Smiling)
I understand. But let me tell
you something. Frank, for all
his ‘issues’, is without a doubt
the most one hundred percent
sanest cat I ever met.

JON
Okay.

DON
Believe it. (Beat) Me, on the
other hand...

He laughs. Jon joins in.
JON
Oh, well... you seem pretty sane
to me!
Don nods, stares out at the sea, smiling.
DON
Yeah. (Beat) But no, seriously,
I am severely mentally ill. I
spent a lot of time ina
psychiatric hospital.

Jon's smile fades.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (3)

JON
Right.

DON
(Sadly)
I used to have sexual relations
with mannequins.

JON
(Beat)
Right.
DON
(Informatively)

It’s a condition.

I/E. VAN - SWEDISH ROAD - FERRY PORT - DAWN

The van drives through a snowy landscape, away from the
ferry port, the sun rising on the horizon.

Jon is in the back, next to Frank, who appears to be
snoozing.

Clara and Nana and Baraque are all asleep in the front.

Jon nervously glances over at Frank’s head. He
scrutinizes the hair, the painted cheek...

As he looks closer he suddenly notices an EYEBALL
staring out at him through the EAR HOLE.

JON
(Shrieking)
Jesus Christ!

The eye vanishes, retreating back into the darkness of
the head.

Jon faces front again. The others still sleep. After a
moment Jon hears a noise from under Frank’s head.

FRANK
Tsss.

Frank is indicating that Jon gets closer. Jon does.
Frank indicates closer still.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Tsss.

Jon awkwardly gets his ear very close to Frank's
‘mouth’.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(An urgent whisper)
HELP ME.

(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:

Jon recoils. Clara stirs in the front, turns to look at
them. Frank hurriedly pretends to be asleep. We hear
fake snores from inside the head.

Jon stares ahead, not knowing what the hell just
happened.

DON
(driving)
We'll be there in two hours
people.
JON
At the venue?
DON
What?
JON
At the... where we’re playing
tonight?
DON

We’re not playing tonight Jon.

JON
Oh. (Beat) I’ve only brought an
overnight bag.

No-one answers.

JON (CONT'D)
I don’t suppose... if we're

staying more than one night, maybe
if see anywhere that sells clothes

and...

CLARA
Oh. The keyboard player wants to
stop.

Jon says nothing, but notes the insult.

I/E. SWEDISH MOTORWAY SERVICES - EARLY MORNING

Jon looks at the T-shirts. They’ve all got Swedish

tourist slogans: I Love Swedish Girls, I Feel Sweden and
one with a bright yellow silhouette of a naked girl hitch-
hiker, with SWEDEN emblazoned on the top.

Needs must, Jon picks the naked girl hitch-hiker. He
walks towards the CHECKOUT.

Frank is suddenly beside him.
FRANK

Take my arm.

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

JON
What?

Frank links Jon’s arm, and starts to lead him towards the
door.

FRANK
Two friends going for a walk. Who
could question THAT?

They exit the shop.

EXT. TOURIST INFORMATION CENTRE - CAR PARK - CONTINUOUS

FRANK
(Hissing, urgently)
I am being held against my will.
By the woman.

Jon looks perplexed.

FRANK (CONT'D)
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

Jon hesitates for a second.

FRANK (CONT'D)
RUN!

WIDE: Jon and Frank run urgently across the car park,
towards a FOREST.

EXT. SNOWY FOREST WILDERNESS - MORNING

It’s snowing. Frank and Jon hack through the
undergrowth together. Jon keeps turning to see if
they’re being followed. They aren't.

JON
Are you okay?

FRANK
(Energized)
I never felt better in my life.
Thank you! It’s been terrible.

Frank breathes in the air, a FREE MAN at last.

JON
How long has the woman...
FRANK
Clara.
JON

How long has Clara held you for?

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:

FRANK
I don’t even know!

Jon leans over and brushes a dusting of snow from the
top of Frank’s head. Franks seems to flinch slightly.

JON
(By way of
explanation)
Snow.
FRANK
Thank you!
(Surveying the

forest)
God! Wow! You saved my life.
I'll never forget this.

Jon and Frank continue to walk for a while.

JON
(Kindly)
Is she the one who makes you
constantly wear...

Frank suddenly stops. His ‘face’ stares at Jon eerily.
Jon indicates the head.

JON (CONT'D)
The... big false head?

Frank continues to stare. Jon looks suddenly worried
that Frank may not even know that he’s wearing a false
head.

JON (CONT'D)
(Panicking a bit)
Okay. Too many questions. What
we need to do is work out the
practicalities.

They resume hacking through the undergrowth.

JON (CONT'D)
Our bags are on the bus. So we
don’t have any... thing.

FRANK
(Picking up on
Jon's panic)
What’1l happen at nightfall? My
face stays warm but the rest of
me can get very cold.

Frank's head gets wedged between two branches. He
struggles and fails to get free.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Oh God. Oh God.

(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED: (2)

JON
It's okay. I’ve got it.

Jon prises Frank's head free.

FRANK
Thank you.

Ahead of them is a fairly bare MOTORWAY SERVICES AREA.
Jon pats his pockets.

JON
Money. I haven’t got any money.
Have you got money?

FRANK
I’m sorry?
JON
(Urgently)

Money! Have you got any money?
There is a pause. Frank hands Jon his change.

FRANK
(Sounding nervous)
It’s all I have.

JON
It’s not much. Have you got a
cashpoint card?

Frank nervously shakes his head no.

They emerge from the woods and enter the...

EXT. BARE MOTORWAY SERVICE AREA - CONTINUOUS

It’s just a toilet and a coffee/snack stand on a lay-
by. There are a few other people there - TRUCKERS, a
FAMILY.

FRANK
(With nervous over-
politeness)
Would you mind if I go to the
toilet?

JON
(Distracted)
Mmm? No, that’s fine.

Frank immediately scurries frantically away across the
tarmac.

(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:

JON (CONT'D)
(In a flap, not
noticing Frank has
gone)
Okay. I’1l send out an S.O.S
tweet.

Jon gets out his phone and types urgently into Twitter:

JON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The singer from The...
(Beat)
-band I've joined is a kidnap
victim. I rescued him and we're
now on the run.

  

Behind Jon's back, Frank zigzags around, panicked and
confused, until he’s FAR AWAY ACROSS THE TARMAC. The
Family and Truckers eye the scene with uncertainty.

JON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(Still typing)
Does anyone know the number for
the Swedish police?

Frank runs up to a TRUCKER.

FRANK
That man kidnapped me!

TRUCKER
What?

FRANK

He’s taken all my money! I’ve
managed to get away from him.

Frank scuttles into the forest, where he vanishes.

The TRUCKER and his CO-TRUCKER start running towards
Jon.

JON (V.O.)
(Oblivious, still
typing)
If anything happens to us I want
it on record that the kidnapper
is called Clara.

Jon turns around just in time to see the two truckers
loom over him.

JON
Huh?

TRUCKER
(In broken English)
The man in the head has said some
things about you.

(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED: (2)

JON
What?

The trucker takes Jon's arm.

JON (CONT'D)
Hey. Let go of me.

Jon angrily pulls his arm free.

At this, the second trucker throws himself on Jon. The
phone flies out of his hand, smashing on the tarmac.

LATER
The SWEDISH POLICE are releasing Jon back to the band.

Don is emerging from the woods leading a dishevelled
Frank, his clothes matted with leaves and mud.

Clara gives Jon a withering look. Jon looks embarrassed
and confused. Don wanders over to Jon.

DON

Don’t worry about it. Everyone

kidnaps Frank sooner or later.
I/E. TOUR VAN - SWEDISH ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The van passes through the lovely snowy landscape.
Jon glances at his iPhone. He’s managed to stick it
together with gaffer tape so it’s cracked but still
working.

His Twitter following has shot up to 946.

JON
Wow.

DON
Here it is! Vetno! Our new home.

FRANK
I LIKE it!

The band look out of the van windows. Stunned.

EXT. “VETNO” — SWEDEN - MOMENTS LATER

A beautiful, enormous, weird wooden house stands in
snowy grounds - something from a fairy tale. The band
stare at it.

Jon looks confused and alarmed.

Don unlocks the huge, wooden front door. They enter.

(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:

JON
(Clutching his
overnight bag)
Excuse me. How long will we be
staying here for?

Nobody answers.

INT. VETNO - MOMENTS LATER

The band walk through the amazing house, taking it all
in. Jon walks alongside them, wide-eyed, but ANXIOUS,
examining the others as much as his surroundings.

JON
(To Don)
Don. Sorry. I told work I'd be
back on Monday. So do you think...

A small shriek O.S.

Frank has got his head wedged in the gap between the
staircase and the wall. Don frees him.

DON
(To Frank)
Problem area. Under staircase.

FRANK
(Cheerfully)
Noted.
They climb the stairs and reach the upstairs landing.
MONTAGE
..of Don showing each band member their BEDROOMS.
They’re all SPACIOUS and BEAUTIFUL. Jon’s is last, at the
end of the corridor.

DON
And here’s your room, Jon.

It is TINY - the SMALLEST in the house. But it is still a

strange and interesting little wooden room, like
something from a fairy tale.

INT. JON’S BEDROOM - VETNO - CONTINUOUS

JON
Don. How long are we going to be
here?

DON

Just as long as it takes to make
the album, Jon.

(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:

Don closes the door, leaving Jon alone in the bedroom. He
stands there - his bag in his hand.

INT. VETNO - JON’S BEDROOM - DAY
Jon looks out of the window.
We hear a Theremin playing - beautiful, ghostly.

JON (V.O.)
Vetno.

Jon sits on his bed. He types a BLOG.

JON (V.O.)
Sweden.

Jon thinks. Types carefully...

JON (V.O.)
Snowing.

EXT. VETNO - DAY

Clara is playing a Theremin in the snow, a power cable
running back into the house. She looks lost in the music -
quite lovely.

JON (V.O.)
We've been here a week. It's a

whole new way of living - quite
unlike anything I've ever known.

Jon takes a step towards her.

CLARA
STAY AWAY FROM MY FUCKING
THEREMIN.

Jon takes an anxious step backwards.

INT. BEDROOM - VETNO - NIGHT

Jon looks into a bedroom to see Clara, Nana and Baraque
lying in bed together, draped casually over one another,
Baraque reading a book.

JON (V.O.)
All the usual bourgeoise rules
have been thrown out of the
window.

Jon covertly peeks at Clara’s cleavage. He regards the
Bohemian lifestyle with admiration.
25.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Nana queues for the bathroom. Jon exits, a towel draped
over him in a manner so ‘studied bohemian’ he’s making no
attempt to cover his penis.

A horrified Nana puts her hands over her eyes and shrinks
away, VERY UPSET.

JON (V.O.)
Although one still has to be aware
of the limits.

LATER
Don is telling Jon off. Nana still looks upset.

At the end of the corridor, regarding the scene, is
Frank.

JON (V.O.)
And at the heart of the beautiful
madness is Frank. Frank. How to
describe Frank?

INT. VETNO - JON’S BEDROOM - EARLIER

Jon is unpacking his overnight bag. He looks up to see
Frank standing in the doorway, watching him, his big
painted smile, his hands on his hips. Jon smiles at him

JON (V.0.)
Sometimes he seems friendly.

Frank slips into the shadows.

JON (V.0.)
But at other times more
..-menacing...

Frank reappears in the doorway. Something in his body
language makes him seem more threatening this time. Maybe
it’s because he no longer has his hands on his hips.
They’re hanging limply at his side.

Jon looks at him nervously, then instinctively lowers his
eyes.

JON (V.0.)
But then ...friendly again.

Jon looks up again to find that Frank has his hands on
his hips again.
26.

INT. VETNO - LIVING ROOM - EARLIER

Frank is watching a stupid Swedish comedy programme,
shaking with laughter.

Jon watches from the doorway.

JON (V.O.)
Also quite ...childish?

LATER
Frank is still shaking with laughter - although it’s now
harder to see why, as he’s watching a gardening
programme.
JON (V.O.)

Disconcerting. But mostly...
INT. DINING ROOM - VETNO - EVENING
Frank is ADDRESSING the band at dinner.

FRANK
Clara. Don. Nana. Baraque...

Frank looks at Jon.

FRANK (CONT'D)

(Coughing)
Mhwr.
JON
(Politely)
Jon.

Frank stretches out his arms.

FRANK

(With enthusiasm)
Jon. Here, in Vetno, on our own
land, we will make music that has
never been made before. We will
journey to the furthest corners
and grab hold of the music we find
there. We are, every one of us,
amazing. Here in Vetno we will
become even more amazing. And we
will capture it, here in Vetno, on
our first ever album.

JON (V.O.)
«+. mostly inspiring.
27.

INT. VETNO - JON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jon is finishing writing his blog. Moonlight pours in
through the window.

JON (V.O.)
So settling into communal living
isn't easy. New people, new rules.
But it's worth it because of
Frank. I'm happy to be part of
this. Just... happy.

Jon presses send. He closes his laptop. A beat of
silence. Then from outside comes a sudden CRY. Silence.
Then another muffled shout of distress.

Jon looks out the window.

EXT. VETNO - MOMENTS LATER

Jon comes out the back door of the house wearing his
coat and boots but no trousers. He sees Don, NAKED,
running towards the tree-line at the bottom of the
grounds and the frozen river beyond.

In the distance, near the river, Clara plays her
outdoor Theremin.

FRANK
(Shrieking - in the
doorway )
Don! Get back here!
(To Jon)
Don’t let him get to the river!

Jon runs after him, chasing Don as he zig-zags across
the snow, but he’s too slow to catch him. Don shakes
him off.

Don is almost at the river when Clara stoops from
behind her Theremin, picks up a lump of WOOD and hurls
it at him. It catches Don on the side of the head and
he spins to the ground, rolling over and over in the
snow.
ON DON
-.as he lies crying.
Frank approaches.
DON

Let me do it Frank! I don’t want

to be me.
Nana and Baraque are standing a little way off, looking
scared.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

28.

Frank gives Don a sad hug, although the size of Frank’s
‘head’ makes hugging quite an awkward experience for
the person being hugged, so Don has to crane his neck
right back.

INT. VETNO - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Frank sits alone on the sofa. Jon watches him from the
other side of the room.

FRANK
(Sadly)
Did he tell you about the
mannequins?

JON
Yeah.

FRANK
I met one once. Caroline
Cuntley.

He offers Jon a handshake, as if he has no memory of
ever meeting him before.

FRANK (CONT'D)
I’m Frank.

JON
(Beat)
I’m Jon.

They shake hands.

JON (CONT'D)
(Beat)

Does he still ...with the
mannequins?

FRANK
No, he has relationships with real
women now. But ...it’s hard you
know? He has to try and convince
them to lie completely still,
so... (He shrugs) Don’t tell Don I
said anything. He might think it’s
a shameful secret or something.
But I say Tell Everyone
Everything! Why cover anything up?

Beat. Jon glances at the fake head encasing a real

head.

JON
Can I ask you something?

FRANK
Sure.

(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:

Frank leans forward, his ‘head’ in his hands.

JON
(Indicating the
head)
Why do you...?
FRANK
You think it’s weird?
JON
A bit.
FRANK

Well normal faces are weird too.
The way they’re smooth...

Frank mimes with his hands the curvature of Jon's
cheeks.

FRANK (CONT'D)
+..smooth...smooth...and then...

Frank mimes with his hands Jon's eyes, nose and mouth -
a mime of utter chaos.

FRANK (CONT'D)
..-bleurewwweurgh...

There’s something lovely but slightly unnerving about
Frank's way of speaking. The words tumble out of him,
like he’s a passenger in his own thought process.

FRANK (CONT'D)

All bumpy and holes and I mean
what are EYES like? Like a
science-fiction movie. And don’t
get me started on lips. They’re
like the edges of a very serious
wound.

JON
(Thoughtfully)
That’s true. But your head is
still sort of ...intimidating.

FRANK
Underneath I’m giving you a
welcoming smile.

JON
(Beat)
Are you?
FRANK
Like this!

The same static expression.

(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED: (2)

FRANK (CONT'D)
Would it help if I said my
facial expressions out loud?

JON
(Beat)
Okay. I’ve been wanting to
thank...
FRANK

Welcoming smile.

JON
...to thank you. Ever since that
night I played with the...sorry,
what’s the name of the band
again?

FRANK
I have NO IDEA.

JON
Why do you have an impossible to
say, spell or remember band name?

FRANK
It was Clara's idea.

JON
Anyway, ever since I played with
you that night I haven’t been able
to think about anything else.

FRANK
It was the best concert we ever
did.

Jon doesn’t know how to respond to this. Clara enters.

CLARA

(To Frank)
He’s asleep. I'm going to bed. So
if you want help getting to bed
you should come now... Unless you
want to keep going with your
little chat with the keyboard
player.

JON
(Coughs )
I’m not just a keyboard player. I
write songs too.

CLARA
Oh? How many ‘songs’ have you
written?

JON
About 40.

(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED: (3)

A dreadful silence from Clara.

JON (CONT'D)
45?

FRANK
(Enthusiastically)
You write your own songs?

JON
I'd love to play some for you
sometime.

FRANK
I'd really like that! Big non-
threatening smile indicating that
there’s no such thing as failure
in Vetno!

Jon points at his own delighted face.

JON
Delighted look!

FRANK
You’re FUNNY!

Frank points at his own face.

FRANK (CONT'D)
DELIGHTED LOOK!

Frank and Jon laugh. Clara looks disgusted.

INT. VETNO - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Jon passes a bedroom. He peers in.

JON'S P.O.V - Clara lies asleep in bed. Frank sits on a
chair next to the bed.

Jon stands in the doorway. Frank sees him.

FRANK
(Whispering)
First rehearsal tomorrow.

JON
(Whispering)
I’ve already got an idea for a new
song.

INT. VETNO - MORNING

The band has gathered in the rehearsal room. They’re
IMPROVISING far out, experimental music. Jon is surprised
to find himself keeping up with it.

(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:

FRANK
(Calling over to Jon)
Hey. How did that song you were
working on last night turn out?

JON
I think kind of interesting.

FRANK
Why don’t you play it for us?

JON
Sure. It’s pretty rudimentary.
Feel free to join in if you like.
It’s called Messy Rainbow.

Jon starts to play his composition. Which sounds quite
deep and intense and uncannily like Paranoid Android by
Radiohead.

JON (CONT'D)
(Singing)
My mind's a Messy Rainbow
And suicide's
The only way
To make the messy feelings go
Away.

A fragile looking DON listens, unnoticed, from the
doorway.

JON (CONT'D)
(Singing
relentlessly)
Let me do it.
Let me drown myself
Don't wanna be me.

Don looks upset by the song. So do the band. Jon doesn’t
notice. He’s lost in his music, playing relentlessly on.

JON (CONT'D)
(Singing)
Let me drown...
CLARA
(Interrupting)
DON!
Everyone turns around, thrilled to see him.

FRANK
Hey buddy!

They surround Don, ignoring Jon.
FRANK (CONT'D)

How you feeling?

(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED: (2)

DON
Better.

Jon awkwardly stops playing.

EXT. THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A lovely spring day. The band are walking amid the
nature.

JON (V.0.)
Frank has decided to delay
rehearsals while everyone has a
chance to get back on their feet.
In the meantime we're doing what
he calls ‘Fieldwork’.
MONTAGE

..of the band amid the nature. They’re COLLECTING
NATURAL SOUNDS on tape recorders.

IN A FIELD

Nana records the sound of a butterfly flapping it’s
wings.

ON THE BEACH
Baraque records the waves hitting the rocks.
Clara records the wind whipping through a cave.

A TERN ominously circles them all. They all stare up at
it. It swoops down, squawking, and dive-bombs Jon.

JON
(Shrieking)
For fuck’s sake! It could have
attacked any one of us! Why choose
me?

The bird files away.
CLARA
Like the zoo scene in The Omen,
really.
Frank points his tape recorder at Jon.
FRANK
What was the sound the seabird
made as it swooped down, Jon.

JON
Kind of...

Jon lets out a BLOODCURDLING SQUAWK.

(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:

They all laugh. Jon laughs too.
EVENING
The fieldwork is over and they walk back towards Vetno,
thoroughly happy. Even Jon seems finally to have settled
in with the others.
JON (CONT'D)
(To Frank)
That was a lovely April day.
Frank hesitates for a moment. Then he continues walking.
LATER
Frank is at the piano, composing a song called APRIL DAY.

It is by far the loveliest and most accessible song we've
heard from him.

Jon listens, entranced. The other band members do their
own thing in other parts of the room.

Jon gets out his mobile phone and COVERTLY FILMS Frank
singing April Day. Frank finishes the song.

JON (CONT'D)
(Stunned)
Frank. That was beautiful.

FRANK
Flattered grin followed by a
bashful half-smile.

JON
I had no idea you could write
music so ...lovely. That song
could be big.
Clara laughs sarcastically from across the room.
CLARA
Yes! Top of the Pops for us! I’1ll
phone Lady Gaga!
Baraque sniggers.
CLARA (CONT'D)
(Calling)
Maybe we can play Superbowl
Sunday! I’1l get T-shirts made!
More sniggering from Baraque.

Frank pulls Jon to one side.

(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED: (2)

FRANK
(Whispering)
You understand!

JON
Understand what?

Clara glances over suspiciously at their private
conversation.

FRANK
Understand that people could like
our music. Clara doesn’t want
people to like us.

JON
Why not?

FRANK
I don’t know. It’s weird.

JON
(Glancing over at
Clara)
It’s really weird.

I/E. VETNO - KITCHEN - GARDEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jon is busy making a stew. Clara enters.

CLARA
What's this?
JON
Potatoes.
CLARA
(Indicating the
stew)

And what’s THIS?

JON
(Beat)
Stew.

CLARA
You're making us brain dead with
your vegetables you dreary old
woman.

JON
(Mystified)
It’s just a stew, Clara. It’s
hearty.

CLARA
Someone needs to punch you in
the face.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Perry Como eats stew while he
sits in his ROCKING CHAIR
LOOKING AT HIS CHRISTMAS
DECORATIONS. Is that the music
you want us to make?
Jon blinks.
JON
No.
Clara steps in close.
CLARA

Why are you here?

Clara glances in disgust at Jon's SWEDISH TOURIST t-
shirt.

CLARA (CONT'D)
You're not going to meet any
naked hitch-hikers here. So why
don’t you stop having secret
conversations with Frank and go
home.

Jon gathers his courage.

JON
Fuck you.

Clara steps in close.

JON (CONT'D)
Frank picked me. Okay? So it’s
not up to you.

CLARA
What?

JON
He... he said I was cherishable.
And he picked me to join the
band.

CLARA

(A smile spreading

across her face)
He picked you? There wasn’t
anyone else. Don couldn’t find
anyone else. So we were STUCK
with you. You're just some
fingers being told which keys to
press. Ten little bits of bone
and skin.

Jon tries to laugh derisively but looks worried that it
may be true.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

JON
I... I press my own keys, ok? And,
anyway, I’m perfectly capable of
finding a way of going to my
furthest corners and...composing
music...

CLARA
Your furthest WHAT?

JON
(Beat)
My furthest corners.

Clara smiles coldly.

CLARA
You know that incredibly
insensitive song about Don’s
suicide attempt you sang us all
the other day?

JON
(Beat)
Yes?

CLARA
It was basically Paranoid Android
by Radiohead.

JON
(Beat)
No it wasn’t.

CLARA
(Sings) “From a great height. From
a great height...” You sang
(Sings) “Let me do it. Let me
drown myself.” Exactly the same.

JON
(Beat)
No it’s not.

CLARA
You want to know where your
furthest corners are?

Clara walks right up to Jon and waves her hand an inch
in front of his face.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Right there! And you know where
mine and Frank’s furthest
corners are?

Clara opens the back door and runs out into the snow.
She keeps running until she’s far, far away.

CLARA (CONT'D)
(Yelling)
..-here!

Jon stands at the back door, staring out at her,
furious.

JON
You’re wrong!
CLARA
(Yelling)
Lick my ass!
JON
(Yelling)

You’ve only made me more
determined than ever to go to my
furthest corners and make
something of myself in this band
and help Frank reach his potential
too!

CLARA
(Yelling)
Lick my ass!
INT. VETNO - LIVING ROOM - DAY
CLOSE on Frank. He’s making an announcement.
FRANK
Lips pursed together as if to say,
“enough frivolity”. Today we begin
work in earnest on the album.
WIDE - the band sit watching Frank.
MONTAGE begins.
JON (V.O.)
Frank wants us to start everything

from scratch.

Frank writes out a strange symbols on a white board for
the band to see.

JON (V.O.)
He's created an entirely new
musical notation system...

Jon covertly films the scene on his mobile phone.

EXT. VETNO - DAY

Clara and Baraque are making a strange contraption
involving household implements.

(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:

JON (V.O.)
...and new musical instruments...

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The band are watching a presentation. A wire runs from
Frank's head to a dial in Don’s hand. As we watch Don
turns the dial and Frank's head begins to GLOW EERILY -
lit by some inner mechanism.

JON (V.O.)
He's working on some new forms of
visual entertainment...

Don turns the dial to high - the head glows brightly,
then there is flash of light and smoke begins to pour
from Frank’s eye and ear holes. Don and the others throw
wet blankets onto Frank to put the fire out.

Jon covertly films it all on his mobile phone.

INT. OUTSIDE BEDROOM - DAY

The band queue outside the room for their daily Gestalt
Therapy Session.

JON (V.O.)
.-.and he wants us to deconstruct
everything about our lives.

We can hear Clara inside yelling at Nana.

CLARA (0.S.)
(Yelling)

You fat old whore! You useless

bitch! Why are you so fucking

ugly? Dragging around like a

broken sow pig!

The door opens and Nana walks out, smoking and unruffled.
Clara waves in her next victim, looking like a dentist. A
nervous-looking Jon enters the bedroom. Clara gives a
small smile of anticipation as she closes the door.

INT. OUTSIDE BEDROOM - DAY

Frank is on the floor in the middle of a wrestling bout
with Baraque. He’s surprisingly strong.

JON (V.0.)

He's initiated a strict regime of

physical exercise.
In a few moments Frank has Baraque pinned and is bending
his arm.

JON (V.O.)
Fortunately we have a “safeword”
for when things get too intense.
BARAQUE

Frank releases him and the two get up and shake hands.

EXT. VETNO - DAY

The band jog around the house.

FRANK
Someone’s thinking in the key of
c!
CLARA
(Calling, as she

runs)
Frank can feel someone thinking in
the key of C!

BARAQUE
(As he runs)
Il n'est pas moi.

JON
(As he runs)
It’s me.

Clara runs over to Jon and UNEXPECTEDLY PUNCHES HIM IN
THE FACE.

JON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Sometimes tensions run pretty
high.

The other band members pull her off.

INT. VETNO - KITCHEN - EVENING

Frank, Nana and Baraque are gathered around the back
door, listening intently as it RATTLES in the wind. From
somewhere outside comes an answering CREAK of metal from
another door.

BARAQUE
(Puzzled)
Je ne peux pas...
Frank holds up a hand to silence him.
FRANK
Can you hear it?

(CONTINUED)
41.
CONTINUED:

Nana and Baraque listen anxiously, trying to hear what
Frank is hearing.

LATER

Nana and Baraque are playing bass and snare drum by the
door, mimicking the odd little rhythm of the rattle and
creak. Frank listens, bouncing his head along
enthusiastically.

FRANK (CONT'D)
We could make an entire album out
of this one sound!

Nana and Baraque smile. Jon covertly films on his mobile
phone.

JON (V.O.)
Frank finds inspiration in
everything. I'd love to get inside
that head. Inside that head.

I/E. JON’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Jon sits working on a new song. It sounds LOVELY. Jon
looks very happy with it as he plays.

JON (V.O.)
I'm really developing as a
songwriter and hope maybe to even
have some of my own songs on the
album.

Jon continues to play as he glances out of the window.
JON'’s P.O.V - OUT OF THE WINDOW.

Frank is lying on a mat in the snow, sunbathing in
swimming trunks, still wearing the head, of course.

Clara is standing over him.
FRANK
(Looking up)

How long?

CLARA
(Looking at her
watch)
One more hour.

Frank resumes sunbathing.
CLOSE on Clara.
JON (V.O.)

some other members of the band.

Don listens for a moment.

DON
(Commiserating)
Oh, man. I know.

JON
(Beat)
What?

DON
(Sighing in
commiseration)
I know how it feels to try and
write a song and it just comes out
shit.

Jon's hands freeze at the keyboard.
Don sits down next to him.

DON (CONT'D)
(Sadly)
Listen to this.

Don plays something unexpectedly lovely and quite
brilliantly professional.

DON (CONT'D)
(As he plays)
I composed this. Yeah, I know.
It’s shit. Sooner or later you get
the feeling, “Why can’t I be like
Frank? Maybe I can be him?” But
there can only be one Frank, man.

JON
(Stiffly)
Actually, I think both our songs
sound pretty good.

DON

DON
Quatchita, Louisiana.

Jon stares sullenly at the keyboard.
JON

It’s all right for Frank. He’s
mentally ill.

DON
(Beat)
You ever tried Ayahuasca?
JON
What?
DON

Ayahuasca. Shamen have been using
it for thousands of years. You
really want to try and go where
Frank is, you should try it. It’s
a hallucinogenic so deep-acting it
awakens your dormant plant DNA.

JON
I don’t think we have dormant
plant DNA.
Don looks at Jon like he’s crazy.

DON
Well I sure as hell do.

LATER

Jon lies on the bed, warily looking at his keyboard. He
falls asleep.

THE NEXT MORNING

Jon sits at his LAPTOP. ON THE SCREEN - An empty Google
search box. Jon’s finger drifts over the keyboard. He
presses H...O...

ON THE SCREEN

The GOOGLE AUTOFILL FUNCTION kicks in. All the search
terms beginning with the letter H and O that Jon has ever
typed appear in a scroll-down list:

Horny Brunette masturbates and flashes her asshole

Hot Asian teen takes two cocks

Hot young college girls strip down and take dick

Jon keeps typing: How to be creative.
45.

MOMENTS LATER
Jon watches a VIDEO called Unlocking Your Creativity.
ON THE SCREEN

MANAGEMENT GURU
Creative people like you can see
solutions where other less
creative people don’t even realize
there’s a problem! Take everyday
activities like shaving.

INT. VETNO - COMMUNAL BATHROOM - LATER

We see various accoutrements necessary for Frank's
condition - four normal-sized toothbrushes and one with a
custom-built ESPECIALLY LONG ARM, an equally long RAZOR
and bottles of SPRAY FACE CREAM with long necks.

Jon is rubbing shaving foam onto his face.

MANAGEMENT GURU (0O.S.)
As Edward De Bono once said, how
often does someone who is using a
traditional wet razor stop to
consider whether instead of moving
the razor it might be easier to
keep the razor still and move the
face?

Jon begins to shave in this radical, creative new way -
keeping the razor still whilst moving his face.
INT. OUTSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Clara stands waiting for the bathroom. From inside we
suddenly hear Jon give an UNUSUAL CRY of pain. Clara
listens, INTRIGUED.

JON (0.S.)

Oh... God!

INT. VETNO - LIVING ROOM - DAY
The band stand around as Clara plays a THEREMIN SOLO
that’s obviously been inspired by the UNUSUAL SHRIEK Jon

let out. The band nod, impressed.

CLARA
I call it The Idiot Shriek.

JEAN BARAQUE

(Murmuring)
C'est tres belle.

46.

Jon watches bitterly, his face tufted with tissue to
staunch the blood from his deep shaving cuts.

Suddenly...
BANG! BANG! BANG!

The band look ASTONISHED. They glance anxiously at each
other. Hopefully it was just their imagination.

BANG! BANG! BANG!

CLARA
(Quietly)
There’s someone at the door.

Nobody moves.

DON
(Nervously)
I‘’ll go.

We stay with the band as they watch Don walk towards the
front door. He opens it.

There are four LARGE YOUNG MEN standing there. They are
muscular and heavily-tattooed. They and Don speak for a
moment.

The band watch with concern, unable to hear the
conversation. Don leaves them standing there and walks
back towards the others.

DON (CONT'D)
(Trying to control
his emotions)
Okay, I have some news. We have to
leave this house.

The band stare at him in puzzled silence.
DON (CONT'D)
(Freaking out)
PACK YOUR BAGS AND GET OUT!
LATER

Don has been calmed with a cup of cocoa. The four new men
are standing together at the back of the room.

FRANK
Okay. Start again, Don. Patient
Smile.

CLARA

Will you stop saying your fucking
facial expressions out loud? It’s
incredibly annoying.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

FRANK
(Beat)
Okay.

DON
We've run out of time. We’ve spent
all our rent money. They gave us
30 days notice to leave. And we
didn’t leave. So they’ve rented
Vetno to a new band.

They look at the four new men, who smile awkwardly.

LARGE YOUNG MAN
(In broken English)
We're Bloodbath.

CLARA
(To Don)
How long have you known this was
going to happen?

DON
(Beat)
30 days.
CLARA
Why didn’t you tell us?
DON
(Beat)
I didn’t want to disappoint you.
BARAQUE
(In French -—
subtitled)
We haven’t recorded one note of
the album.
Everyone looks at Frank.
JON

I can pay.
Everyone looks at Jon.

JON (CONT'D)
When my father died I inherited
money. He said it was my nest egg.
He said I should only ever spend
my nest egg on something really,
really important.

(His voice breaking)
I want you to have my nest egg.

Frank stands up. He HUGS Jon. As always with Frank’s
hugs, the size of the head makes it quite awkward.

(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED: (3)

JON (CONT'D)
It’ll buy us enough time to make
the album.

LARGE YOUNG MAN
(Broken English)
We've driven all the way from
Hudiksvall.

JON
I’1l give you money to leave.

LARGE YOUNG MAN
How much?

JON
(Beat)
5000 Krona.
The men look satisfied.
FRANK

(To Jon)
Thank you so, so much.

Jon can’t resist shooting Clara a little grin of triumph.
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. JON’S BEDROOM - VETNO - NIGHT
CLOSE on Jon’s hands as he writes his blog.

JON (V.O.)
It's been a while since I've
written anything. We've been
pretty busy, working on the new
music, fourteen hours a day,
for...

We pan up Jon's body. He’s still wearing his naked hitch-
hiker t-shirt, now massively faded. We see his face. He
has long hair and a full beard.

JON (V.O.)
(Calculating)
---a@ year and eleven months now.
Which has depleted my nest egg a
lot more than I anticipated.

EXT. VETNO - DAY

Looking through the lighted windows to the band
practising the same complicated five second sequence...

(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:

FRANK
Again!

Again...

FRANK (CONT'D)
Again!

INT. KITCHEN - VETNO - DAY

The band, wild-eyed and feral, the men long-haired and
bearded, ravenously eat their tiny daily ration of SOYA
BEANS.

JON (V.O.)
It hasn't been easy. None of us
have left Vetno since we got here.
We've had to start rationing the
food.

I/E. FRONT DOOR - VETNO - DAY

A GROCERY BOY stands at the door. Jon, looking starving
and animalistic, opens it.

The boy - overpowered by a waft of Fetid Commune Smell -
quickly hands Jon the grocery bag.

Jon immediately rifles ravenously through it until he
finds a jar of HOT CHOCOLATE POWDER. He guiltily scurries
to a corner and pours it hungrily into his mouth.

Clara, passing-by, spots Jon.

CLARA
Thief!

She runs over and attempts to pull the powder from Jon's
grasp, whilst simultaneously prising open his mouth and
thrusting in her hand, scraping the powder from inside
it.

CLARA (CONT'D)
I want it ALL back!

Clara pulls Jon's fingers painfully back.

JON
(Yelling)
Those are my KEYBOARD PLAYING
FINGERS!

JON (V.0O.) (CONT'D)
Clara's hatred of me remains as
strong and baffling as ever. I
just seem to rub her up the wrong
way.

(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:

In their struggle the hot chocolate jar explodes, the
powder covering them in a cloud.

Frank walks in. Clara and Jon stand, caught out, both
covered in chocolate. Frank stares at them in silence for
a moment.

INT. JON’S BEDROOM - VETNO - DAY

Jon composes at his keyboard. The song is just flying out
of him

JON (V.O.)
A lifetime ago Frank said our job
here was to journey to the
furthest corners and grab the
music we found there. The journey
has been a long one. But I think
I'm finally there.

A STUNNED look crosses his face.
JON
(To himself)
Oh God. This is REALLY GOOD.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jon runs excitedly down the hallway.
JON
Frank!
INT. THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FRANK’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
JON
(Knocking on the
door)
Frank?
INT. FRANK’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jon walks into the bedroom. It’s empty.

The sound of running water comes from the en-suite shower
room.

Jon stops, staring at something: Frank's HEAD sits on a
chair beside the bed.

Jon hesitates and then picks up the head. He peers
inside, fascinated. He crosses to a mirror and stands,
the HEAD raised above his own. Slowly he begins to lower
the false head down over his own face - then he freezes.

(CONTINUED)
51.
CONTINUED:

Something has just occurred to him. If the head if out
here and Frank is in the bathroom...

He puts the head down and creeps towards the open
bathroom door...

JON’S P.O.V

Someone’s in the shower - obscured by the steamed up
cubicle door.

Jon peers closer, trying to pierce the fog and finally
see Frank’s true face.

Suddenly the cubicle door opens and Frank steps out -
naked...

-.except he’s still WEARING HIS HEAD. He has a clear
plastic bag over it, with breathing holes. The one on the
bed is the spare.

Jon is too surprised to hide and the two men stand
staring at each other.

JON
Hello.

FRANK
(Beat)
Hello.
Jon remembers why he’s there.
JON
I’ve written a song.

INT. LIVING ROOM - VETNO - DAY

Jon is playing his song for Frank and Clara. And it is,
indeed, by far the best he’s ever sounded. He finishes.

FRANK
Amazing.
JON
(Beat)
Really?
FRANK

I think it’s ...Hey! Can I just
make a couple of...

Frank sits down at the piano.

FRANK (CONT'D)
So you played...

(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:

Jon gives Clara a triumphant glance as Frank starts
working on his song.

Clara takes a seat on the stool next to Frank.

CLARA
And then if you just...

Clara moves Frank's fingers to a different note.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Because if you played ...What was
that note you played down there,
Jon?

JON
F.

CLARA
Yes because if you played an F
there it would be shit.

Jon looks like he’s been punched in the face.

Clara and Frank continue to turn Jon’s song into
something TOTALLY DIFFERENT - something much STRANGER and
MORE INTERESTING.

Frank is just innocently going about what he does. But
Clara is fully aware that she’s crushing Jon.

FRANK
What do you think?

Clara looks up and gives Jon a dreadful, slow smile.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(Beat)
We're ready.

LATER

The band have set up. Don is finishing arranging mics
around them.

JON (V.0.)
Frank has decided it's finally
time to record the album. They're
not using any of my composition
which I can't help thinking is a
bit of a kick in the teeth bearing
in mind the fact that I gave them
my fucking nest egg.

Don walks through to the hall outside and sits at a
mixing desk.

(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:

DON
(Into desk mic)
Vetno tapes. Take one.

He starts to RECORD.

A MONTAGE of moments from the recording. It twists and
turns with overwhelming, beautiful oddness.

We hear the theremin moment inspired by the IDIOT SHRIEK
SHAVING INCIDENT. Jon still looks annoyed by it.

We hear the complicated five second sequence they spent
weeks practicing over and over.

LATER

The band stand around Don's recording equipment,
listening to their work.

DON
That's it, Frank?

FRANK
Uhuh. That’s it. We’re done, Don.
We're done.

JON (V.O.)

It took us three hours to record
the album. From start to finish.
Two years’ work. Three hours.

The band stand around, stunned.

Frank notices that Don has a strange smile, eyes
glistening.

FRANK
You okay?
DON
(Mumbling)

It’s just so good.
He nods.
DON (CONT'D)
We're done.
INT. VETNO - BEDROOM - DAWN
Jon wakes up. He gets up, starts to get dressed. He

glances out of the window... stops suddenly, staring at
something in the trees.

(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:

JON’S P.O.V - OUT OF WINDOW

Frank is HANGING from a tree. He’s perfectly still.

LATER

The band are cutting down the body and carefully
lowering it to the ground.

Baraque carefully removes the plastic head to reveal
DON - quite dead.

We see the real Frank, wearing his false head, watching
from the back of the group. The rest turn to stare at
him

Baraque passes him the spare head Don had worn. Frank
holds it.

EXT. LAKE - DAY
The band have set up by the lake.
They’re placing Don’s body onto a crude wooden raft.

Frank lights the raft and pushes it out onto the water.
The flames begin to spread, an improvised Viking
funeral.

The band begin to play Puff the Magic Dragon...

FRANK
(Singing)
Puff the Magic Dragon, lived by
the sea, and frolicked in the
Autumn mist in a land called
Honalee...

Jon and the others watch the boat drift away into the
mist on the lake.

Jon hears a PING coming from the iPhone in his hand. One
new email.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(Singing)

Little Jackie Paper loved that

rascal puff, and brought him

strings and sealing wax and other

fancy stuff.

Jon is torn between wanting to maintain an appropriate
air of mourning and wondering who emailed him. His
curiosity wins out. He covertly glances at the iPhone.

His eyes widen - amazed at what he’s read.

(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:

The fire consumes the raft. Frank stops singing.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Goodbye Don. You were the best
keyboard player we ever had and
the best man I ever knew.

JON
Don used to be the band’s keyboard
player?

CLARA

Yes. First it was Don. Then Lucas.
Now it’s you.

Frank somberly slips the plastic bag with breathing holes
over his head and leaps into the lake. He begins to swim
towards the boat.

BARAQUE
(In French -
subtitled)
What are you doing?

FRANK
I’m getting his ashes.

BARAQUE
(In French,
subtitled)
Wait until the fire’s died down.
Clara notices Jon looking at his phone.
CLARA

(To Jon)
What?

INT. LIVING ROOM - VETNO - LATER THAT NIGHT
A BAND MEETING
Frank is shivering with a blanket around him.
CLARA
You've been secretly putting clips
of us on what?
JON
You Tube. But that’s not the news.

I got an email.

CLARA
You Tube?

JON
Just snippets. But...

CONTINUED:

CLARA
Show me.

Jon presses play.

56.

CLOSE on the screen: A grainy, tantalizing 20 second
video of FRANK singing at Vetno.

JON
I made the clips really short and
tantalizing. So you're like a
mysterious masked man.

CLARA
You spied on us?

JON
No. Yes. But that’s not the point.
The point is I got an email this
morning. Because of these clips
we've been offered a gig. A really
important gig.

They stare at him.

She heads

JON (CONT'D)

us to launch the album at New
Discoveries.

How ridiculous.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Come on, Frank. Let’s get you into
the shower.

FRANK
(Looking at You Tube)
Why does it say 23,751 at the
bottom?

JON
That’s the number of people who’ve
watched the clip.

Frank looks at Jon.

FRANK
23,75...

JON
Reload.

Jon presses reload.

FRANK

This is like magic.

Clara glares at Jon.

JON
(To Frank)
I told you we could be big.

EXT. HOT TUB - FOREST - VETNO - LATER

Jon, NAKED, soaks himself in the bubbles, looking
pleased with himself. Clara appears, standing ominously
over the Jacuzzi.

CLARA

(Hissing loudly to

make herself heard

over the bubbles)
What game are you playing
filling Frank's head with
bullshit ideas about festivals
in America?

JON
(Loudly )
I can’t hear you over the sound
of the bubbles.

Clara angrily prods the Jacuzzi switch. The bubbles get
bubblier.

CLARA
How the fuck do the fucking
bubbles...?

JON
(Loudly )
You just pressed the full bubble
strength button.

Clara furiously punches the buttons.

JON (CONT'D)
(Loudly )
They’re on a timer. You just
restarted. They won’t switch off
for 10 minutes now.

CLARA

(Shouting)
Leave Frank alone.

CONTINUED:

JON
(Shouting back)
YOU leave Frank alone. That time
he thought he’d been kidnapped by
you? I’m beginning to suspect it
was true!

Jon steps out of the Jacuzzi. He’s toe to toe with Clara.

JON (CONT'D)
I’m fully aware you want me to end
up like Don or Lucas. But that’s
not going to be my role in this

band.

CLARA
Middle Management!

JON
Josef Fritzl!

CLARA
Piers Morgan!

JON

Cunt!
Panting with rage, Clara suddenly notices Jon is naked.
Her eyes involuntarily flitter downwards. They look at
each other.
EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
Jon and Clara are having VIOLENT SEX in the forest.

Clara is on top of Jon, grabbing hold of his hair,
SMASHING his head onto a rock on the ground.

Jon is both desperately aroused and also in a LOT of
pain. He pants and grunts and says Ow. For a moment he
looks worried that she’s actually trying to murder him.
LATER

The sex is over. Jon and Clara lie naked amid the
nature, looking up at the sky.

JON

This is going to be awkward.
CLARA

What is?
JON

Us. You know. Together.

Clara has a good laugh.

CLARA
We'll never be ‘together’.

JON
Right.

CLARA
I find you disgusting.

JON
(Beat)
Oh. Okay.

CLARA
Me with you...!

JON
I get the point.
(Beat)
Clara. What does he look like?

CLARA
(Shrugging)
I don’t know.

JON
You've never seen him without the
head on?

Clara shakes her head.

JON (CONT'D)
Who made it for him?

CLARA
He doesn’t talk about it.

JON
I thought maybe Don had. In the
mental hospital.

Jon stares sadly into the sky.

JON (CONT'D)
Was it awful in the mental
hospital, Clara?

CLARA
What?

JON
Was it awful in there?

CLARA
How do I know?
(Beat)
What are you talking about?

JON
(Beat)
Nothing.
CLARA
No. What?
JON
(Beat)
I... assumed you're mentally ill.
CLARA
(Stiffly)
Well I’m not.
JON
(Surprised)

Huh!

(Beat)
So why are you so against us
finding an audience? If it’s not
because you’re mentally ill?

CLARA
When you package the music you
kill it.

JON

But how are people going to hear
the album if we don’t launch it?
The music doesn’t exist until
people hear it. Who are we doing
it for otherwise?

Clara looks at Jon as if he’s an idiot.

CLARA
For each other.

JON
(Suddenly)
You love Frank! You're in love
with him! You're scared that if
other people love him you’1l lose

him
CLARA
Fuck off.
JON
(Teasingly)

You're in love with him!

Clara picks up a nearby rock and mimes violently
bludgeoning Jon to death. Jon stops teasing Clara.

She puts the rock back down.

(Sighing)
If you fuck everything up in
America I'll stab you.
EXT. VETNO - MORNING
The band, still long-haired and dirty and bearded,
emerge with their luggage from the SILENCE and
STILLNESS of Vetno.
Everyone looks anxiously at the outside world. They
walk towards their van, which has gathered significant
dust.
JON (V.O.)
Today we leave Vetno. Hashtag
weirdly nervous.
I/E. VAN - SWEDISH ROAD - DAY
Clara is driving.
CARS zoom loudly past them. They involuntarily SHRINK
back into their seats like children raised by wolves.

EXT. PETROL STATION - DAY

The band sit in the van, looking deeply self-conscious
and alienated. A PETROL PUMP ATTENDANT approaches.

JON
Don’t do anything weird.

Clara shoots the attendant a massively over-friendly
smile.

CLARA
Fill her up please!

Of course in her desperate effort to seem normal she's
coming over as TOTALLY CRAZY.

Frank's arm shoots involuntarily upwards, as we...

CUT TO:

EXT. TEXAS DESERT - DAY

A breathtaking desert landscape, into which drives a
rental van.
62.

INT. RENTAL VAN - TEXAS DESERT - DAY.
Jon looks out of the window.

JON
Wow. It’s like Paris, Texas. So,
okay, I’ve booked us a warm-up
show in Houston. Very low key.
Just to ease our way back into the
world. And then straight to South
By Southwest...

FRANK
Pull over, Jon.

Frank roots around in the back of the van.

JON
What are you looking for?

FRANK
Don.

EXT. TEXAS DESERT - DAY

The band stand watching as Frank with a bag of Don’s
ashes.

FRANK

Don, I remember you saying that
the desert here was your favorite
place in the whole world. After
Sea World, San Diego. And I know
you were homesick, Don. I know
there were times you wanted to
come back here, but you didn’t
because of me. Well you’re home
now Don. And we’re going to make
sure that those sacrifices you
made weren’t in vain. It’s your
album we recorded Don - and we’re
going to share it with the world.

He opens the bag and tosses the ashes into the air.
There’s no wind and they land with a CLUMP on the sand in
front of them.

I/E. DRESSING ROOM - MUSIC VENUE - TEXAS - EVENING

It’s a down-at heel place in a Houston suburban strip.
Baraque, beard gone, head shaved, is busy shaving the
rest of the band’s heads. It makes them look even more

like a cult. Nana is painting over Frank’s painted hair,
so that he too looks shaved.
63.

THE WINGS

The band watch Frank, waiting for the word from him, like
soldiers waiting for their Captain.

FRANK
In this moment only the five of us
know what the whole world is about
to know. That we have found the
music that will change everything.

The band look determined, almost grim. They march out
onto the stage to be met by a faint welcoming applause.

They glance at each other, understanding the huge
significance of the moment. Nana and Baraque begin to
play. After a moment Clara and Jon join in.

Frank stands in the wings, listening. And very slowly his
head begins to GLOW.

As the head reaches MAXIMUM ILLUMINATION he BOUNDS OUT
onto the stage, jerking and shuffling to the beat.

He sings.
DISSOLVE TO:

A MONTAGE of moments from the live show. It twists and
turns with overwhelming, beautiful oddness.

Finally the music ends in a gigantic crescendo. We await
the inevitable roar from the crowd. But instead...

...the SMALL, BAFFLED AUDIENCE offer a tiny SMATTERING of
UNINTERESTED APPLAUSE.

The band stare at the crowd. They can’t believe it.
LATER

The band sit behind a STALL, failing to sell any copies
of the Vetno album. The AUDIENCE - ORDINARY LOOKING MEN
and WOMEN - walk past them without showing any interest.

FRANK (CONT'D)
We got the music wrong.

CLARA
The music’s right. They’re wrong.
Fuck them. Our American adventure
is over. We go back to Europe.

JON

No! Forget these hick conformist
fucks.

JON (CONT'D)
Things will be different at South
By Southwest. Trust me, Frank.

They love us already there. Frank.
They love us already.

EXT. MAIN STREET - SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST - DAY

The band, just arrived, make their way through the buzzy
festival CROWDS.

The atmosphere is much more bohemian and hipsterish than
at the warm-up show. A HIPSTER BAND plays on a nearby
bandstand. HIPSTERS in nerd glasses hand out fliers for
their gigs.

Jon is delighted to be among these refreshingly cool,
young, free-thinking people. He’s truly in his Xanadu.

Passers-by look impressed by the band.

PASSER-BY
Awesome costumes you guys!

PASSER-BY 2
You look amazing. Where are you
playing?
JON
(To the passer-by)
The Blind Pig.

PASSER-BY
Awesome venue! Good luck!

Jon shoots the others a thrilled and vindicated look.

INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

Jon is at the accreditation desk, behind which stands two
beautiful hipster festival official - SIMONE and ALICE.

Simone exudes LACONIC HIPSTER IRONY, Alice is more UPBEAT
and SINCERE.

The rest of the band hang back.

So. Here’s the passes and an
information pack. Oh, did Simone
pronounce your name right?

JON

Jon?

ALICE
The band’s name.

JON
Oh. I actually don’t know.
(Calling, to Clara)
Clara? How do we pronounce the
band’s name?

A little way back, Clara shrugs, unhelpfully.
ALICE
You guys are hilarious! So a bunch
of us are having dinner tonight at
a hot dog place in town. Come!

JON
Awesome!

childlike song - perhaps PRINCESS CHELSEA singing THE
CIGARETTE DUO.

(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:

We pull back. She’s performing on a little stage in the
corner.

HIPSTER DINERS - including Jon - regard the singer with
FONDNESS. Clara regards her with HORROR.

The place is ironically tacky and July 4th themed -
American flags, Uncle Sam paraphernalia, portraits of
Joey ‘Jaws’ Chestnut, the world’s greatest hotdog
competitive eater.

The band, Simone and Alice eat hot dogs at a big table.

Frank holds a napkin over his face to cover the shameful
sight of his feeding himself tiny bits of sausage under

the neckline of the head.

ALICE
(To Frank)
You guys have been in the forest
so long all this craziness has to
be kind of intimidating I guess.

Frank continues to completely conceal his ‘face’ with the
napkin.

FRANK
(Trying to sound
normal )
Oh quite the contrary, I’m
delighted to be launching our
album here, Delighted look.

Clara's eyes dart across the room.

Clara's POV: A nightmarish montage of HIPSTER MEN and
WOMEN, all looking EERILY SIMILAR - nerd glasses, Zooey
Deschanel faces, ironic facial hair, tacky t-shirts that
advertise Ocean Spray, etc.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(To Alice)

I'm excited that for the first

time we'll be performing for

people who already know and love

us, thanks to Jon and his clever

secret camera.

Frank's voice has taken on a weirdly formal air.

JON
(To Alice and Simone)
They didn’t know I was filming
them at Vetno.

SIMONE

Well, how about you, Mister Secret
Squirrel.

JON
I AM Mister Secret Squirrel!

ALICE
Well it worked. We noticed you.
And you got invited here.

FRANK
Thrilled grin!

Frank's arm slips and he spills a jug of syrup over
himself and his food.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Oh dear!

ALICE
Oh, man, are you okay?

Frank clumsily tries to clean the syrup off himself.

FRANK
I’m fine! I’m so fine you
shouldn't even bother mentioning
the thing that’s currently
happening.

Frank's attempts at cleaning himself are making him and
his head FAR STICKIER.

FRANK (CONT'D)
Really! Carry on talking as if
this isn’t happening.

ALICE
(Slightly weirded-
out)
O-kay. So. Who have you played for
in the past?

FRANK
(Formally)
Until now our audiences have
tended to be people who chance
upon us and realize after a few
minutes that they don’t like us.

Clara stops GLARING at hipsters in time to sigh
ostentatiously at this.

FRANK (CONT'D)
I see it in their faces, Clara.
First they’re like this. But then
they’re like this.

Frank continues to try and clean himself.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(To Alice)

So this is a most exciting and

unique opportunity you’ve given

us.

Frank gives Alice a sincere look. By now he has bits of
syrupy-napkin stuck all over his face.

Jon, seeing Frank's predicament, springs into efficient
action. He spits on a napkin and begins wiping the
detritus from Frank’s face.

CLARA
Mummy's here.

Baraque sniggers.

CLARA (CONT'D)

(Indicating the

childlike hipster

singer)
Why don’t you team up with
Princess Marigold over there and
start a day care center. She can
sing the baby songs and you can
wipe the faces and the asses.

ALICE
Actually, I gotta tell you guys,
We know who you are. Simone and
me. We found you. But the audience
won’t have heard of you yet.

FRANK
(Astonished)
But more than 23,700 people
watched us on You Tube.

JON
(Nervously)
They’re cool, though, right? I
mean...

He surveys the room. Jon’s POV: the same people Clara
found so eerie Jon is finding awesome.

SIMONE

(Dryly)
They’11 love you.

Jon does a slight double-take. Simone’s vocal tone is
consistently so ironic it’s hard to tell if she means
anything she says.

ALICE
Are you crazy? They’ll go crazy
for you! You do know that a stand
out gig at New Discoveries can...

But, hey, don’t sweat it! Just be

yourselves! Maybe do some research
about which bands did well at New

Discoveries and which bands didn’t
in previous years and try and work
out why and just be yourselves!

The singer finishes to APPLAUSE from everyone except
Clara, Nana and Baraque.

INT. HOTEL BAR - LATE AT NIGHT

The place is deserted. Jon sits hunched intensely over
his laptop. The rest of the band enter.

FRANK
What is it Jon? You look scared.
Has something bad happened?

JON
Not scared. I’ve worked something
out. Look.

They approach Jon’s laptop.

JON (CONT'D)
(Enthused)
Right. Frank. You’re abnormal.

Frank nods, equally enthused.

JON (CONT'D)
Let me show you someone else who’s
abnormal.

Jon presses play.

ON THE SCREEN - A You Tube clip of BABY DEE singing
beautifully but very strangely...

BABY DEE
(Singing)
Who can save me from the man
Who wields the grinding stone
He wields the grinding stone.

JON
Abnormal. Did a New Discoveries.
16 You Tube hits.

The song ends. We hear a smattering of applause from the
tiny audience.

(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:

JON (CONT'D)
Whereas...

Jon presses play.
ON THE SCREEN

A more MAINSTREAM band - still difficult and avant-garde,
but with a generally more likeable, nerdy, ironic, SELF-
AWARE demeanor, and a nice stable drum beat.

JON (CONT'D)
Still abnormal. Stormed New
Discoveries. 380,000 You Tube
hits. What does this teach us?

FRANK
(Beat)
Go on.

JON
That two years in the forest has
calibrated us slightly too far
towards the wrong sort of mental.
Everything that’s successful here
happens within a certain boundary
that we are currently just outside
of.

CLARA
Nobody's listening to you.
Mediocre Child.

FRANK
(At Clara)
Shh.

Clara looks like she’s been slapped.

JON
We've always demanded that the
audience stretch their corners all
the way out to meet ours, Frank,
but what if we pull our corners in
a tiny bit - just a tiny, tiny
bit - so everyone’s corners can
meet in a place that's stilla
really long way off but a bit
less...

Jon does a exaggerated impression of Clara’s Idiot Shriek
Theremin solo.

JON (CONT'D)
..-and a bit more... likeable. Do
we want a smattering of baffled
applause at New Discoveries or do
we want to raise the fucking roof?

(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED: (2)

ON THE SCREEN - the more likeable band finish their song
to RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE.

JON (CONT'D)
Frank?

Frank holds his hand out to hush Jon. A silence. Frank is
silently composing.

FRANK
(with great import)
I think I’m writing my most
likeable song ever.

JON
(Beat)
Can we hear it?

Clara looks like she wants to kill Jon.

INT. BEDROOM - HOTEL - LATE AT NIGHT

Frank sits at the keyboard. The rest of the band gather
in readiness to hear Frank’s most likeable song ever. Jon
films the scene on his iPhone.

FRANK

I’ve always dreamed that one day
I’d have a band member who shared
my vision of creating extremely
likeable music. So thank you, Jon.
You gave me the little push I
needed. Okay. Enough chatter. Here
it is. My most likeable song ever.

Frank begins to play.

Bang! Bang! Bang! It's the same glorious, strange,
ridiculous, totally non-mainstream stuff that Frank has
always played. The madder end, in fact, of his oeuvre.

Frank finishes. A beat.

CLARA
This is your most likeable song?

FRANK
Yes.

Clara doesn’t show a thing on her face.

CLARA
People will love it.

Frank raises his arms in jubilation.

(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:

JON
(Clearing his throat)
Actually, Frank, I think we can
push the likability even further.

FRANK
No way! You’re shitting me. (Beat)
HOW?

EXT. FOREST - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

The band has gathered with their instruments. Jon has got
hold of some VIDEO EQUIPMENT. He’s standing behind the
camera.

CLARA
(To Jon)
Let me see if I got this right.
You want us to make a video in
which we pretend our music doesn’t
matter so the people here who act
like babies won’t be scared of us.

JON
No. Well, sort of. Look. You know
the crazy person on the bus that
nobody wants to sit next to?
That’s us. But if we just lighten
up... be a tiny bit more likeably
self-aware...

CLARA
I’m not playing a fucking ukulele,
I’1l tell you that now.

FRANK
I’m going to point at my head a
lot! Like this!

Frank dances around a little too over-zealously, pointing
at his head.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(As he dances)
Press record, Jon. I’m ready.

Jon presses record on his video camera and hurries over
to take his place behind the keyboard.

They start playing a MORE HIPSTER version of one of their
songs.

Everything is a little different. Frank’s voice and dance
seem more IRONIC. Jon has a new, ironic, keyboard sound.
And hipster sunglasses. Baraque and Nana are dutifully
going along with it - their bass and percussion are more
unvarying than normal.

(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:

Only Clara is holding out. She has adopted her most
intimidating scowl, and is playing as HARSHLY as she can
muster. But her protest is useless. Jon has managed to
make them sound likeable rather than alarmingly
experimental.

The overall effect - seeing the band like this - is both
likeable but also strangely sad.

The song reaches an instrumental section. Frank addresses
the camera.

FRANK (CONT'D)
(Talking too fast)

Hi, South By Southwest. We’re the

Sknprfbs or something.

CUT TO:

CLOSE on a computer screen. The Forest Video has been
uploaded to the NEW DISCOVERIES website.

FRANK (CONT'D)

We've been in the forest for two
years like secret squirrels but on
Friday night we emerge so come and
see us then at the Blind Pig you
guys and watch us shake the leaves
from our clothes and be not like
secret squirrels any more but
regular squirrels.

We pull out to see that we are in...

INT. SIMONE AND ALICE’S OFFICE - DAY

Simone and Alice watch the video. Alice regards it with
an upbeat and enthusiastic smile, Simone seems more
laconic.

I/E. CANOPY. SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST - EVENING

A New Discoveries PARTY is in full swing. The CROWD and
the decor are cool and ironic and hipsterish.

SIMONE
(Dryly, to Jon)
Love the promo video.

Jon looks at her quizzically. Is she being ironic or
sincere?

JON

(Beat)
Thanks?

(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:

SIMONE
I’m being sincere.

JON
Phew!

Across the party, Frank is being chatted up by a HIPSTER
GIRL.

HIPSTER GIRL
Awesome promo video.

FRANK
(Talking too fast)
Thank you we’re going for a kind
of not believing in anything thing
awesomely.

Clara gets in really close and gives the girl her best
DEATH STARE.

HIPSTER GIRL
(Dryly, to Clara)
Oh. Hi.

A chilling silence from Clara.

HIPSTER GIRL (CONT'D)
I know you. You’re the woman from
the band who looks like she’s from
a different band.

Jon, joining them, smirks. He’s filming the party on his
iPhone.

CLARA
(To Frank)
Come on, Frank. Let’s get away
from these children.

FRANK
(Talking too fast)
Leave? Good heavens, no. I’m
incredibly happy to be here and
relaxed.

LATER

The party continues in full-flow. Clara is confronting
Jon in a corner.

CLARA
Frank’s tipping over the edge.

JON
No he’s not. What are you talking
about? He says he’s incredibly
happy to be here and relaxed.

(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED: (2)

CLARA
He said it in an unhinged tone of
voice and you know it.

They look over at Frank, who continues to flirt with the
girl.

JON
He looks pretty happy to me.
Whereas you seem...

CLARA
What?

JON
(Coldly)
Out of control.

Clara falters, suddenly seeming less confident. She just
looks at Jon.

JON (CONT'D)
Gosh. You've run out of insults?

LATER

The party is getting more riotous. Jon wanders anxiously
through the crowd.

JON (CONT'D)
(Calling)
Frank? (Beat) Frank?

He finds Nana and Baraque.

JON (CONT'D)
(To Nana)
Have you seen...

He realizes this is pointless. He turns to Baraque.

JON (CONT'D)
Have you seen Frank?

BARAQUE
(In French,
subtitled)
Clara has taken him away.

JON
Where? To the hotel?

Baraque gives Jon a cold smile and says nothing.
JON (CONT'D)

(Startled)
Where?
76.

EXT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
Jon runs through the streets.

JON
(Calling)
Frank! Frank!
(To a hipster passer-
by)
Have you seen a man wearing a fake
head?

HIPSTER PASSER-BY
(Laconically)
A crazy-looking lady is pulling a
guy with a fake head along just
around that corner. Could that be
the guy in the fake head you’re
looking for?

JON
(Beat)
Likely.
Jon runs around the corner and sees...

..Clara PULLING Frank away, her hand firmly clasped to
his.

JON (CONT'D)
(Yelling)
Stop.

Clara and Frank stop.

JON (CONT'D)
Where do you think you’re taking

him?
CLARA
Fuck off, Jon. He’s falling apart.
JON
(To Frank)

She’s the one who’s nuts, Frank.
Not you. You’re fine!

Frank breaks free of Clara. He walks towards Jon.

JON (CONT'D)
You know it. You told me yourself
that Clara is crazy. She kidnaps
you and she’s very weird and
doesn’t want you to have fans.

CLARA
Remember what things were like at
Vetno, Frank. There was no stress.
Everything was good there.

(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:

At this, Frank suddenly stops, midway between Jon and
Clara. He glances from one to the other, not knowing
which one to go to.

CLARA (CONT'D)
Everything was quiet and good at
Vetno, Frank. Don’t you remember?
Let’s go back there.

JON
See! She wants to keep you locked
up like at Vetno. She’s just weird
and jealous.

CLARA
You’re out of your depth, Jon.
Frank. You’re not well. We need to
be somewhere quiet. Just us.

JON
Tomorrow night is everything we've
worked for! They’re ready to love
us, Frank. Frank. They’re ready to
love us. Don’t throw it away.

Frank looks at Clara.

FRANK
Clara.

He starts walking towards Jon.

JON
Oh thank God.

Jon watches Frank walk towards him in the moonlight. It’s
a beautiful sight. Jon gets out his iPhone and begins to
film it.

CLARA
(Calling)
You win. Well done.

Clara starts walking towards Jon too. Jon continues to
film the scene.

JON
(A little tauntingly)
I’m sorry Clara. I hope you’re not
too sad. Are you a little sad?

CLARA
Yes I’m a little bit sad.

Clara is almost upon Jon now. Jon suddenly realizes
Clara’s holding a KNIFE.

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED: (2)

JON
(Panicking)
Chinchilla!
Clara STABS JON IN THE LEG.
PANDEMONIUM

Jon falls to the floor and rolls about shrieking.

PASSER-BY
Jesus Christ.

JON'S P.O.V - from the floor.

Clara turns to Frank. Is she going to stab him too? But
she suddenly realizes what she’s done. The knife falls to
the floor.

CLARA
Frank.

A PASSER-BY grabs her.

ON JON - lying on the floor, beneath the pain, a gleam
of remorselessness in his eye. His dream has come true.

INT. JON’S HOTEL ROOM - SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST - MORNING

Jon is lying on the bed, his leg bandaged, typing into
TWITTER on his laptop.

JON (V.0.)
Clara Fricke, our very own Syd
Barratt, was arrested today and
charged with assault after
stabbing me in the leg. See
link. We will all miss Clara and
sincerely hope that our own
crazy diamond will also shine
on.

Jon smiles slightly to himself.

JON
And... twitvid.

Jon lies back on his bed, satisfied.

INT. FRANK’S HOTEL BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Jon hobbles quietly into the room and joins Baraque and
Nana staring at a prone Frank lying on his bed.

BARAQUE
Il Dort.

(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:

JON
He's dead?

BARAQUE
Asleep.

WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
He's sick.

Jon and Baraque both turn, surprised. It is NANA. And
this is the FIRST TIME SHE’S SAID A WORD during the
entire movie.

JON
(Thrown)
He's... just had a fright. He’ll
be fine for tonight.

NANA
Not Frank. You.
JON
(Beat)
Sorry?
NANA

I’ve known it since the first time
I saw you. On that beach. You'd
have DROWNED Lucas to take his
place in the band.

JON
(Beat)
No I wouldn’t have.

NANA
Because you look inside of
yourself and you can’t find
anything there.

JON
Yes I can.

NANA
So your only hope is to live off
Frank’s talent like a tick. Which
is why you had to get rid of
Clara. You had to make her stab
you.

JON
Clara CHOSE to stab me!

Nana sits beside Frank on the bed, takes his hand.
NANA

(Gently)
Frank?

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED: (2)

No answer.

NANA (CONT'D)
F ade so gently)
‘rank!

FRANK
(Beat)
What?

NANA
We can’t play without Clara.

JON
What? What are you talking about?
She's going to prison! We don’t
know how long for! Meanwhile we
have the biggest gig of our lives
coming up in three hours.

NANA
(Ignoring him)
Frank?

JON
(Bulldozing)
Which, by the way, is getting
bigger by the minute. The stabbing
could not have come at a better
time, Frank.

He takes out his phone.

JON (CONT'D)
I posted the stabbing clip two
hours ago. (Beat) We are currently
Twitter's worldwide number one
trending topic. I’ve had everyone
at South By Southwest on the
phone.

He plays the clip on his phone - we hear the tinny scene
playing out.

NANA
(To Frank)
Baraque and I have packed our
bags. We’re leaving.

JON
What? No. You... you can’t.

From the phone we hear a tinny Jon.
JON (0.S.) (CONT'D)

(Over phone)
Chinchilla!

Jon presses reload.

JON (CONT'D)
Reload. 467,914 views! They’re all
watching!
(To Nana and Baraque)
Don’t leave.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATER

Nana and Baraque shoot Jon a triumphant look as they head
towards the hotel exit.

NANA
(Over her shoulder)
Good luck playing tonight with no
band members.

JON
(With bravado)
I don’t need luck and I’11 tell
you why! One word! ...Unplugged!

Nana and Baraque hesitate for a moment. Has Jon pulled an
ace card? A little less sure of themselves, they leave.

INT. FRANK’S HOTEL BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Frank is sitting up in bed now. Jon is hobbling
animatedly around the room.

JON
Unplugged! Me on acoustic guitar.
You on vocals. Delegates really
like it when bands go unplugged.
It’s a special thing. It’s kind of
pure.

Jon sounds like he’s trying to convince himself as much
as Frank.

FRANK
“Delegates”! “Unplugged”. It’s
like you speak an amazing foreign
language!

There’s an edge to Frank’s voice which could be
excitement. Or could be panic.

JON
I’m fluent in it.

(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:

Frank stares at the empty room behind Jon. Jon notices
Frank's tapping hand.

JON (CONT'D)
Frank? Are you okay?

FRANK
Just excited. Just... so...
excited!

LATER

Jon and Frank are in the midst of a REHEARSAL in the
bedroom - just Frank’s vocals and Jon's guitar.

JON (V.O.)
Hello Twitter. Well I have to say
it's extremely nice to have Frank
to myself without the others
constantly going “Blah blah blah
Jon you're a twat" and stabbing
me.

They’re playing the Vetno music, but the difficult
experimental sounds have been replaced by Jon's
unexpectedly LIKEABLE INDIE GUITAR SOUND.

JON
This is actually REALLY GOOD!

And he’s right. It’s LIKEABLE. And also quite ORDINARY.
FRANK
We're igniting the light and
letting it shine!

Frank wanders into the bathroom as Jon continues to play.

FRANK (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Just doing my ablutions!

JON
Be as quick as you can!

Jon continues to strum.
LATER
Jon stands at the bathroom door, still strumming.
JON (CONT'D)
(Beat)
Frank?
Frank walks back into the room. He has taken a cosmetic

kit to his head. He’s given himself VERY ROSY CHEEKS, a
GARISHLY HUGE SMILE, bright BLUE EYE SHADOW...

FRANK
We can cure CANCER!

Jon stares at Frank uncertainly.

EXT. MAIN STREET - SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST - DAY

Jon is holding Frank's hand, leading him towards the
venue.

Frank shakes off Jon’s grip and veers off to the edge of
the fun, where HIPSTER SECURITY GUARDS are keeping the
fun penned in with concealed BARRIERS.

Frank tries to climb over a barrier.

HIPSTER SECURITY GUARD
(A big fun smile)
Hey man, where are you going?

FRANK
To let off fireworks at a cancer
hospital.

HIPSTER SECURITY GUARD
You’re funny.

The Security Guard turns Frank around so he faces the
crowd again.

HIPSTER SECURITY GUARD
(CONT'D)
Hey, have a great South By.

He gently pushes Frank back into the crowd.

FRANK
Don’t touch me!

(Glancing at
something O.S.)
Ohmygod! A store that sells

medals and feathers!

INT. STORE - MOMENTS LATER

It’s busy, with HIPSTER SHOPPERS. Frank is frantically
pinning medals and feathers to his outfit.

JON
(To the owner)
It’s okay. We’ve got money.

STORE OWNER
You’re the guys from the Internet.

JON
Yep.

(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:

STORE OWNER
I tried to get tickets to see you
play tonight, but it’s totally
sold out. You’re the hot ticket.
What happened to the woman who
stabbed the guy?

JON
(Beat)
She’s in jail.

STORE OWNER
Oh really?

JON
Believe me it’s no loss.

FRANK
(Shouting across
the room)
What does a man have to do to
get some sex around here? I have
NEVER HAD SEX!

Everyone looks at Frank.

I/E. MUSIC VENUE - EVENING

A VERY BUZZY atmosphere. A LONG QUEUE to enter - 100
cool people in a really cool venue. These are the
movers and shakers.

The stage lights come on. The audience hush in excited
anticipation. Many in the crowd have their SMARTPHONE
VIDEOS ready in anticipation.

His guitar around his neck, Jon limps onto the stage,
to cheers.

HECKLERS
Chinchilla!

There’s laughter. Jon gamely points at his bandage and
gives the crowd a thumbs up.

Jon begins to play, his COMPETENT INDIE SOUND.

After a moment Frank walks onto the stage, to a big
cheer. He walks to the microphone.

He stands there, looking at the EXPECTANT AUDIENCE, at
bloggers filming him on their iPhones.

Frank starts to sing. But words don’t come out. Instead

it’s the same weird, high pitched shriek we heard at
Vetno.

(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:

Jon continues gamely on, although a look of MASSIVE
PANIC crosses his face.

The audience glance at each other to say, “Is this
cool? How are we supposed to react?”

Frank starts to shake uncontrollably. He falls
backwards, hitting his head on the speaker.

He reaches up to his head and feels a CRACK. He follows
it with his finger as it gets wider, wide enough to
stick his finger in.

Jon stares at the stunned audience, then down at Frank.
He’s urgently trying to say something to Jon. But the
words won't come out. He indicates that Jon gets
closer.
Jon does. He puts his ear right to Frank’s ‘mouth’.
JON
(Urgently)
What, Frank? What is it?

FRANK
This music is shit.

We PULL BACK to see the full catastrophe on stage,
Frank lying, a mess, on the floor, Jon on his knees at

his side, the audience standing there, stunned, many of
them filming the calamity on their iPhones.

I/E. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Jon and Frank are slumped in their room. Jon looks
utterly defeated.

ON TV:
PRESENTER
..-Cleveland, Ohio band Mister
Gnome had all of Austin talking
last night with a barnstorming
set at South by Southwest...
FRANK
Aren't we supposed to be playing
at South by Southwest?
Jon lets out a big sigh. He looks at his iPhone.
CLOSE on Jon’s iPhone - 13 new emails.
We catch a glimpse of a few words:

‘You guys are insane!’ ‘From Sony Music’. ‘If you can
somehow pull it together...’

(CONTINUED)
86.

JON
(Glimpsing hope)

Frank. I know you weren't happy

with the music. So let's work on

it together.
Frank shakes his head.

JON (CONT'D)
Why not?

FRANK
You're not Clara.
I/E. CAR - AUSTIN - DAY

Jon is driving towards the city limits.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - TEXAS DESERT - DAY

The DESERT looms just beyond a cluster of scrappy,
working-class trailer homes.

Jon pulls up outside one.

EXT. TRAILER HOME - MOMENTS LATER
He knocks on the door. A PERUVIAN SHAMAN answers.

JON
Hello. I saw your advert. In
High Times?

The Shaman considers this.

SHAMAN
Do you have $40?

Jon hands the Shaman the money. He beckons Jon inside.

INT. TRAILER HOME - CONTINUOUS

The Shaman leads Jon through the living room - where
his WIFE is watching Daytime TV - and into his
kitchenette, where an enormous ORNATE SHAMANIC BLOWPIPE
sits on the table.

He begins to prepare the AYAHUASCA POWDER. He starts to
CHANT: ‘O-day-o-day-o-day...’

SHAMAN
(Between chants)
Ayahuasca. The doorway to the
other realms. I evoke the spirit
of the plant.

(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:

He continues chanting. The TV is blaring 0.S. The
Shaman flinches, irritated, and chants louder to try
and drown it out.

SHAMAN (CONT'D)
(Finally, yelling
to his wife)

Will you TURN THAT DOWN!

She does.
SHAMAN (CONT'D)
(Between chants)
It was my wife’s sister's idea.
(Adopting a woman’s
voice)
“Move to America. You can be the
movie stars’ Ayahuasca shaman!
You'll live in Beverly Hills!”
You know what it turns out movie
stars don’t want?
JON
What?
SHAMAN

Ayahuasca. (Beat) Are you of
sound mind?

The Shaman continues to chant, heating up strange
liquid on the hob, chopping plants.

JON
I am.

SHAMAN
You are not depressed?

He unexpectedly pours steaming black liquid, filled
with pink petals, onto Jon’s head.

JON
I suppose I’ve been miserable
lately but I wouldn’t say
depressed. (Beat) Why?

The Shaman blows weird grey smoke on Jon’s head. It
snakes around his face.

SHAMAN
Ayahuasca takes you to the
furthest corners of your
imagination. You must be strong
enough to face what you find
there whether it be angel or
beast.

(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED: (2)

JON
This is exactly what I’ve been
wanting to do! I really want to
go to my furthest corners.

SHAMAN
Why?

JON
(Gravely)
Because I want to unlock the
music.

The Shaman nods.

JON (CONT'D)
Have I taken the Ayahuasca yet?

SHAMAN
Not yet.

JON
Good, because nothing's
happened.

SHAMAN
You will take it. Something will
happen.

The Shaman lifts the blowpipe. Jon takes one end of it
in his mouth. He hesitates, wondering what the hell
he’s about to do to himself.

JON
Actually can I just...?

The Shaman blows the powder into Jon’s mouth.
Jon looks at the Shaman. Then he falls backwards into
the sofa. Almost instantly he sits back up again and
takes a NOTEBOOK from his pocket.
JON (CONT'D)

I’m going to write music now.

Goodbye.
He walks PURPOSEFULLY out of the trailer and towards
the DESERT.
EXT. TEXAS DESERT - LATER

Jon wanders through the dunes, wildly unhinged but
blank faced.

WIDE - He has not strayed at all far from the FREEWAY.
A steady stream of CARS roar past him.

(CONTINUED)
89.
CONTINUED:

Jon reaches a CRUMBLING ROADSIDE CAFE and he gratefully
sits down at a table outside. He takes out his notebook
and stares at its blank white page, waiting for
inspiration.

The cafe sign above his head CREAKS slightly in the
breeze. Jon stares sternly up at the sign.

JON
Be quiet. I’m trying to hear
what's inside me.

And suddenly ALL SOUND CUTS, and Jon finds himself
sitting in an IMPOSSIBLE SILENCE.

He looks at the CARS and TRUCKS roaring past. But they
too are HORRIBLY SILENT.

Jon looks trapped and frightened inside this oppressive
silence, like an insect trapped in an airless jar.

Jon listens to the infinite silence inside himself. He
mouths a subtitled sentence.

JON (CONT'D)
(Subtitled)

I can’t hear anything.
(And then,
terrified)

I can’t hear ANYTHING!

He looks down at his body and - like a bubble of
nothingness - he POPS. He EVAPORATES. He is GONE.
INT. KITCHENETTE - MOTEL ROOM - SOME WEEKS LATER

Frank and Jon are eating at the tiny table. Jon is
unshaven. The place is a mess.

A steel, pull-down light hangs over the table. As Frank
bends forward to his Complan his head clinks against
it. It dings.

He leans back. Then he leans forward to the straw
again. He clinks his head against the light again.
Another ding.

Jon watches him in mounting irritation.

Frank leans forward again. Jon catches the light and
pushes it up before there can be another “ding”.

JON
(Hardly caring any
more)

90.
CONTINUED:
JON (CONT'D)
The motel owner says if we don’t
pay in full by the end of the
week they’re going to throw us
out.

A FLY buzzes around Frank’s head. Frank tries to swat
it, but - being in a fake head - his spatial awareness
is shot to hell and he accidently swipes a cup,
spilling rancid coffee all over Jon.

FRANK
Oh Jesus I’m sorry.

Frank grabs a dirty cloth from the sink and starts to
mop at Jon's coffee sodden trousers. As he does his
head comes very near to Jon's face and Jon leans back
in disgust. Clearly, Frank is beginning to smell under
his head.

JON
Jesus!

Jon picks up a VERY LONG STICK with a BABY WIPE
attached to the end. He waves it at Frank.

JON (CONT'D)
(Through gritted
teeth)
I made it. Now will you use it?

Frank inserts the baby wipe inside his head. Trying to
clean himself. Jon watches in silence. Suddenly...

JON (CONT'D)
(Softly)
Take it off.

Frank stops moving.

JON (CONT'D)
The head. Maybe you should take
it off.

Frank stares at Jon for a long time. Then he shakes his
head no.

JON (CONT'D)
(Trying to be
enthusiastic, but
sounding tense and
nuts)
You know, in Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy they say face
your fears! They say Take The
Head Off! So let’s do it! Let’s
take the fucking head off!

Jon walks closer to Frank.

Jon reaches Frank and tries to touch the head.

FRANK (CONT'D)
I’ve got a certificate.
JON
(Beat, quietly)
I know you've got a certificate.
(Beat) I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A
FUCKING CERTIFICATE!

Jon and Frank are struggling now, Jon is trying
desperately to PULL Frank’s head off.

The sudden VIOLENCE inside Jon is shocking.

JON (CONT'D)
Take it off!

Weird noises begin to emanate from inside Frank’s head.
They’re the noises of a terrified animal.

The shock of the noises makes Jon hesitate for an
instant.

As he does, Frank slips from his grasp and runs
shrieking towards the door. He manages to get it open
and runs out...

And Jon, as if waking from a nightmare, realizes what
he’s done...

JON (CONT'D)
No! Frank! I’m sorry! I don’t
know what I was thinking! Frank!

EXT. STREET - TEXAS SUBURBS - CONTINUOUS

--the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT.

Shrieking, bewildered, Frank runs confused out of the
motel and towards the SIDEWALK.

Jon runs a little way after him.

JON
Frank! I’m sorry! Come back!

LONG SHOT
Frank runs, disoriented, onto the sidewalk, then over

the curb, and out onto the HIGHWAY. He gets smaller and
smaller. He keeps going.

(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:

And then he is HIT BY A CAR.

The car screeches to a halt as Frank flies over the
windshield.

Jon starts to run towards the scene of the accident.

He reaches the car, and then he walks around it,
expecting to see Frank lying there.

But Frank isn’t there. Instead there is just his HEAD,
lying SHATTERED on the road.

The driver is standing there, shocked.

JON (CONT'D)
Where did he go?

DRIVER
That way.

JON
Did he look injured?

DRIVER
He was limping.

JON
(Beat)
Did you see his face?
The driver begins to answer.

Jon takes half a step back into the oncoming traffic
and is HIT BY A CAR.

Cut to BLACK.

I/E. HOSPITAL - TEXAS - DAY
Jon lies asleep. He’s on a drip. Bandaged up.

He wakes up. Looks around. He can’t remember why he’s
there.

And then he remembers. He closes his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A heavily bandaged Jon sits waiting in the station. A COP
walks over with a form on a clipboard.

COP

You want to report a missing
person?

(CONTINUED)
93.

CONTINUED:
JON
Yes.
COP
Ok. What’s the person’s name?
JON
(Beat)
Frank.
COP
Frank what?
Jon considers this.
JON

Just... Frank?
The Cop examines him balefully.

COP
Age?

JON
Uh, somewhere between thirty
and... fifty?

COP
(Beat)
What's he look like?

Jon considers this. He starts to tear up.

INT. DINER - DAY

Jon, still bandaged, but on the slow path to recovery,
sits at the counter, staring out into the distance.

The YOUNG MAN beside him has been watching him for a
while. Now he clicks his fingers.

YOUNG MAN
Been driving me crazy, but I know
who you are.

JON
(Emptily)
Oh?

YOUNG MAN
You're the Chinchilla guy, right?

Jon nods sadly.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
Awesome. Chinchilla guy, and the
guy with the big head and the
crazy chick... Clara? Right?

(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:

Jon looks at him.

JON
How do you know her name?

YOUNG MAN
Are you kidding?. You’re like
myths. There’s footage of you
fucking everywhere online.

Jon laughs sadly.

YOUNG MAN (CONT’D)
All totally erratic and shit.
Nervous breakdowns. “Chinchilla!”
People rolling around on the
floor. Just wayward! And now it’s
all, ‘What’s happened to Frank?
He’s just vanished.’ Fucking
hilarious.

Jon looks at him with dislike.

JON
I don’t think it’s hilarious.

YOUNG MAN
Really? I thought it was supposed
to be hilarious. I mean, like that
Clara? Being a total freak.
Jon stares down at his coffee.
JON
Don’t call her that.
I/E. ROADSIDE BLUES BAR - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY
A down-at-heel roadside venue. Jon enters to find the
place practically deserted - just some TRUCKERS and
BIKERS and DRUNK LOCALS.

Clara, Nana and Baraque are on stage playing the blues in
a perfunctory manner to the small uninterested crowd.

Jon stands in the doorway, looking profoundly sad at what
he’s reduced them to.

Clara and Nana and Baraque notice him. Their blues trail
off to silence. A few of the DRUNKS applaud uncertainly.

LATER

Jon and the band sit at a booth table.

(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:

CLARA
(Coldly)
We're trying to raise the money to
get back to Europe.

Jon looks desperately sorry.

BARAQUE
(In French,
subtitled)
How did you find us?

Jon slides a NEWSPAPER across the table.

CLOSE on the newspaper. Between gig listings for ‘Bayou
Boogie’ and ‘The Chicken on the Bone Party Band’ is one
for a residency for ‘The Oeccscclhjhn Blues Trio’.

JON
Everything you said, Nana. It was
true. I was a snake.
(His voice breaking)
You have to let me try and put it
right.

Clara turns her face away.

JON (CONT'D)
(Utterly broken)

If you don’t let me try, this is

what I’1l be until I die.

BARAQUE
(In French -
subtitled)
The man who killed the music.
JON
I love all of you. And I’m so
sorry.
A silence.
CLARA
Where’s Frank?
JON
(Beat)
He ran away.
CLARA

(Softly)
Then I will help you find him.

Jon looks at Clara with huge sadness and gratitude.
96.

I/E. CAR - BLEAK COUNTRY ROAD - MINUTES LATER

Jon gives Clara a sad, world-weary smile. Two travellers
who have been through a great and terrible adventure
together.

JON
I turned us all into freaks for
people to laugh at on the
internet.

Clara pulls a cigarette out of her packet and pushes in
the car’s cigarette lighter.

JON (CONT'D)
So I was thinking that the way
to find Frank might be...

Clara unexpectedly leans over and begins VIOLENTLY
STRANGLING JON.

JON (CONT'D)
(Yelping)
Clara?

Clara grabs the back of Jon’s head and starts to slam
it repeatedly into the steering wheel.

JON (CONT'D)
That really fucking hurts!
Clara!

Clara grabs the red-hot cigarette lighter and presses
it against Jon's skin. It sizzles.

JON (CONT'D)
FUCK! FUCK! Clara!

The car swerves off the road, into a field, and crashes
into a tree. Their heads slam against the windscreen.

EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
Clara and Jon stand by the wreckage of Jon's car.

JON
What the fuck did you do that
for? You could have killed BOTH
OF US!

CLARA
(Yelling - the old
Clara)
I leave you alone with him for
FIVE MINUTES!

Clara begins to calm down.

(CONTINUED)
97.

CONTINUED:
JON
Are we okay now? You’ve got your
revenge?
CLARA

We're okay now.

JON
It’s finished?

CLARA
It’s finished now. I’ve got it out
of my system.

EXT. BLEAK COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

Jon and Clara are limping through the nothingness, back
towards the roadside bar.

A TRUCK approaches. Jon sticks his thumb out, giving
the truck driver a plaintive smile.

Clara gives Jon a MASSIVE SHOVE, trying to push him
into the truck’s path.

The truck narrowly misses Jon, its horn blaring.

JON
Jesus FUCKING CHRIST, Clara!
Will you fucking FUCKING STOP?
(Astonished)
You're actually trying to kill
me!

Clara gives Jon the finger.

CLARA
Fuck you and fuck Frank.

She quickly walks away - back in the direction of the
Roadhouse.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - BLEAK MALL - LATER
Jon sits at a table, looking wretched, surfing the net.

CLOSE on Jon’s web search. Page after page is dedicated
to videos and photos of the band: the Chinchilla
stabbing, the Vetno rehearsals, Frank's nervous
breakdown on stage at South By Southwest.

And then more pages - fans speculating on Frank’s
disappearance and possible whereabouts. There are
sightings in Fairbanks, Alaska, Pahrump Nevada;
Quatchita, Louisiana...

Jon stops suddenly and STARES at the words - Quatchita,
Louisiana.

Louisiana. That’s all I know.

JON
Louisiana?

DON
Quatchita, Louisiana.
EXT. RURAL LOUISIANA - DAY
A GRIM LANDSCAPE of RURAL POVERTY, strewn with old
rusting metal, abandoned vehicles, shacks, hungry-looking

dogs.

HILLBILLY CHILDREN and OLD PEOPLE stare suspiciously at
JON as he pulls up outside a SHACK in his HIRE CAR.

GPS VOICE (0.S)
You have reached your destination.
I/E. HIRE CAR - CONTINUOUS
JON
(To himself)
Christ. It’s like Winter’s Bone.

CLOSE on the details of the POVERTY and SUSPICION.

Jon gets out Twitter.

JON (V.O.)
(With great
solemnity, as he

types)
I've found Frank's childhood home.
It's so bleak. No wonder he never
talked about it. I wouldn't be
surprised if he was the victim of
some kind of...

Jon sighs.

JON (V.0.)
.-farm abuse. And now I get it.
This is the pain you need to make
the great music. Hashtag but is it
worth it?

 

(CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:

Jon nervously leaves the car, approaches a HILLBILLY MAN.
Other HILLBILLIES stand a little way off, watching.

JON
(His voice quivering)
I’ve come to see Frank.
The man stares silently.
JON (CONT'D)
(Beat)
Wears a fake head?

The hillbilly spits on the floor.

HILLBILLY
Ain’t no one round here wears a
fake head.
JON
(Beat)
Okay.

(Plucking up courage)
Except He grew up here. And he’s
been sighted here. So I think he
actually may be here?

The hillbillies share a HARD-TO-DECIPHER LOOK.

HILLBILLY
He’s in the shed.

The hillbilly indicates a nearby CREEPY WOODSHED.

JON
(Beat)
Frank’s in that shed?

HILLBILLY
I’1l show you.

The hillbilly walks towards the shed. His friends follow.

HILLBILLY (CONT’D)
C'mon.

Jon nervously begins to follow.

JON
Actually, you know what, I think
I'll leave it.

HILLBILLY
He’s in there. I’1l show you.
(Calling towards the
shed)
Frank. You got a visitor.

The hillbillies, with a now terrified Jon in tow, ENTER

the shed.

INT. SHED - CONTINUOUS

Lying on the floor, in the straw, is an OLD SCARECROW

with a grotesque FAKE HEAD.
The HILLBILLIES laugh.

HILLBILLY
Is this your friend?

Jon politely laughs.

HILLBILLY (CONT’D)

I told you ain’t no one round here

wears a fake head.

JON
Right!

HILLBILLY

What’s the address you’re looking

for?

Jon gets out his MAP QUEST print-out. The HILLBILLIES
ponder it. The Head Hillbilly spits on the floor again.

HILLBILLY (CONT’D)

You typed the wrong zip code into

your GPS.

JON
Did I?

HILLBILLY
(Pointing at the
print-out)

Says here 71008. You typed 71007.

JON
Oh, gosh.

HILLYBILLY
Place you're looking for'’s about
nine miles that way.

JON

(Beat)
Thanks.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LATER

The contrast couldn’t be starker. This is as MIDDLE CLASS

SUBURBAN as it gets.

(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:

Jon sits in his hire car at the bottom of a driveway. He
looks disappointed.

JON
(To himself)
It’s like where I bloody grew up.

He takes a breath. He climbs out of his car.
In the front garden ...a FIGURE, his back to Jon.

Jon walks towards the figure. He stops suddenly, afraid.
Then he takes a few steps forward.

The man turns around. He has the most incredible,
expressive face.

It is obviously Frank.

JON (CONT'D)
Oh, Frank. I’m so ashamed. I
should never have tried to pull
your head off.

MAN WITH AMAZING FACE
(In a voice sounding
nothing like
Frank's)
I’m the tree surgeon. I’m just
here to look at the tree.

FRANK (0.S.)
Hi Jon.

Jon turns around. Across the garden is Frank. Without his
head. Looking nice, gentle, and really quite normal.

He’s standing with two elderly people - Frank’s PARENTS.
All three are wearing gardening gloves. Mary holds a
running hose. They stare at Jon with puzzled smiles.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Jon sits with Frank, his Mother and Father. They drink
coffee but Jon doesn’t touch his.

MOTHER
It used to be a miracle to see him
downstairs like this, right
Frankie?

FRANK
(Smiling)
That’s right.

FATHER
When Frank was a boy we couldn’t
get him out of his bedroom.

CONTINUED:
FATHER (CONT'D)
I mean, he'd get hysterical if we
tried to move him.

JON
What happened to you, Frank?
Something must have happened to
make you like that.

Father looks at Jon like he’s an idiot.

FATHER
Nothing happened to him. He’s
mentally ill.

Jon glances over at the mantelpiece. There’s a FAMILY
PHOTOGRAPH from Frank's childhood.

CLOSE on the photograph: Frank’s PARENTS and TEENAGE
FRANK, trying to hide his face with his hand.

MOTHER
When he was about seventeen he
stopped talking altogether. They
called it Selective Mutism. He
selected it to be all the time. We
didn’t know what to do. So... that
was when he went into the
hospital. Broke my heart.

JON
(Hopefully)
And that’s when you started making
music? As a kind of expression of
the madness?

FRANK
No. I was always musical. Far back
as I can remember. If anything the
madness slowed me down.

Frank frowns at his memories. Then he points at his face.

FRANK (CONT'D)

Look! Facial expressions! Oh, you
were right about encouraging me to
take the head off. Now I’ve got
used to it it’s fine. I think I'd
been using it as a bit of a
crutch.

FATHER

The head was my fault. I made him
his first one. He was 14. He just
begged me and begged me. He said
it was for a costume party.

(Getting upset)
I did it. Even though I knew there
wasn’t any costume party.

A silence.

FATHER (CONT’D)
Turns out the worst thing to do
with an anxiety disorder is pander
to it.

MOTHER
Who knew?

FATHER
He never took it off again.

FRANK
Do you want to see my bedroom?

INT. FRANK’S BEDROOM - DAY

Jon and Frank stand in a little boy’s bedroom.

FRANK
This is where I wrote my first
music.

JON

Have you written anything since
you’ve been back?

FRANK
No. I tried, but nothing good came
out. It sounded, no offence, Jon,
like the kind of stuff you’d
write.

Jon smiles sadly.

Jon nods,

FRANK (CONT'D)

I know what you were getting at
downstairs. You were hoping that
some ...thing had unlocked the
music in me. Something you never
had. But some people have got it
and some people haven't. That’s
the truth of it. I mean, I’m
terrible at everything else.
There’s probably something else
you're great at!

(Brightly)
Like band management! No. Not band
Management. Marketing!

But I’m not good at music any more
either. It’s slipped away. I guess
because Clara’s gone. So.

CONTINUED:

JON
It’s my fault.

FRANK
No it isn’t. You’ve basically been
really helpful.

Jon sits on the bed next to Frank.

JON
Frank. I need to explain to you
how I ruined everything.

We drift away from them, out of the window, into the
garden, where Frank’s mother and father are doing some
gardening.

JON (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I think it started right back on
that beach in England...

INT. ROADSIDE BAR - EVENING

It's the same down-at-heel bar we met Clara and Nana and
Baraque at. They’re still there - playing the blues to
LOCAL DRUNKS who don’t care.

Jon and Frank enter. They stand hesitantly at the back.

Jon gives Frank a small push. He hangs back as Frank
walks towards the stage.

Clara notices this stranger approaching them. There seems
something familiar about him.

He climbs onto the stage and approaches the microphone.
And he starts to SING.

And then she realizes. A look passes between Clara and
Frank.

And, slowly, as Frank sings, we BEGIN TO PULL BACK.

Clara plays more intensely. As do Frank and the others.
And the music makes sense again. It swells to something
beautiful ...difficult but beautiful.

As the music builds into joyful life, we PULL FURTHER
BACK, over the AUDIENCE, who don’t seem realize that
something incredible is happening. They look
uninterested.

But then one or two drunks appear to notice that the

music has changed into something else. They GLANCE UP
from their drinks.

Jon listens from the back. He watches for a moment. Then
he slips out of the door. And we...

FADE TO BLACK.
