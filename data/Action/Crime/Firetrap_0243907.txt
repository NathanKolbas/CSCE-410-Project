“Out of Time”

February 13, 2001
FADE IN:
EXT. DOWNTOWN QUICEO - NIGHT

Detroit's skyscrapers shoot up on the horizon. Quicho’s ten
miles from Detroit, but it might as well be a hundred.

Quicho's got it all: freezing weather, a closed down steel
mill, and a diner that advertises a burnt cup of Maxwell
House as "The World's Greatest Coffee." If Dr. Kevorkian
took towns as patients, Quicho would be at the top of h
list.

 

A police truck stops in front of the bank. Chief MARTY WALSH
hops out of the truck and walks over to the bank. Checks to
make sure that the doors are locked.

Marty's in his mid 30's. He'd be a good-looking guy if he
followed through on his perennial New Year resolutions to
switch to light beer and eat less red meat.

He walks across the street to the Post Office. Checks the
doors. Locked up tight.

Marty climbs back into his truck. Si
EXT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - NIGHT

Marty walks up to the front door. The store's closed. He
pulls out a large key-ring, shuffles through the keys.
Finds the one he wants. Opens up the store. Walks in.

INT. QUICHO COUNTRY STORE - CONTINUOUS

Marty walks through the dark store. He grabs a six-pack of
Bud out of a cooler. Walks over to the cash register. Does
a double-take at the porn magazines. Picks up a "Playboy."
Flips through the pages for a quick beat.

MARTY
(off centerfold)
Nineteen eighty-one? Jesus, I'm
getting old.

Marty tosses it back on the rack. Then he throws a $5 bill
and a note that reads, "6er of Bud -- Marty" on the cash
register.

INT. QUICHO POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The station is small. It's made up of a large bullpen area,
Quicho's single jail cell, and Marty's office, which looks
out on the bullpen.

Marty lays on the cot in the cell, watching "Sportscenter" on
TV as he sips a Bud.
 

phene rings. Marty pulls himself up, reaches between
bars and answers it.

  

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Chief Walsh.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Chief, it's Ann Harrison.
Somebody broke into my house.

MARTY
I'll be right over.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Marty walks up the walkway to a small house. Before he gets
there, the door opens. ANN HARRISON stands in the doorway,
wearing just an oversized t-shirt.

Ann is beautiful -- especially by Quicho's standards. She's
Marty's age, but even if he kept up his New Years's
resolutions she'd probably be out of his league. If Ann's
face couldn't launch a thousand ships, it could get at least
a couple hundred out of the harbor.

Marty takes a long, less than professional, look at Ann as he
walks into the house.

INT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A modest house. A lot of things are still boxed up. Can't
tell whether Ann is moving in or moving out.

MARTY
Did you get a look at him, Ann?

ANN
Yeah. He's about your height,
your weight. Come to think of it,
he kinda looked like you.

MARTY
So he was good looking.
ANN
No. :

Marty stares at her for a beat. She stares right back. A
smile escapes from her full lips.

ANN
Sorry. Just not my type.

MARTY
(under his breath)
Well, bony dyed blondes aren't my
type.
What?
MARTY
{out loud)
So -- this ugly man -- do you know

how he got in the house?

ANN
The bedroom window.

Marty follows her into the bedroom.
BEDROOM
Marty checks the windows. They're all locked now.

MARTY
Why don't you tell me what
happened? .

ANN
Okay...

Ann jumps in bed, pretends to be asleep.

ANN
I was asleep. But then I woke
up, 'cause I felt the cold. I saw
the window was open. Then I saw
him. He was standing right where
you are.

MARTY
Right here?
(she nods)
Then what'd he do?

ANN
He came toward me...

Marty comes closer to her.

MARTY
Like this?

ANN
Uh-huh. Then he grabbed me.

Marty grabs her arms. Pins her to the bed.

MARTY
Like this?
ANN
But he was much stronger than you.
(beat)
Then he forced himself on top of
me.

MARTY
Like this?

ANN
(nods)
Uh-huh. And his breath reeked.
Kinda like yours.

MARTY
Then what happened?

— ANN
He kissed me.

Marty kisses her.

ANN
Then he stripped me naked.

Marty starts to pull Ann's shirt over her head as he
continues to kiss her. Ann starts to moan.

ANN
I'm sorry, I was confused. He
ripped my shirt off.

Marty rips her shirt down the middle, exposing her breasts.
He licks at her breasts, teasing them with his tongue. Ann
moans in pleasure.

MARTY

You didn't put up much of a fight.
ANN

Oh, really?

Ann flips Marty over so that she's on top of him. She
fumbles with his belt, kicks his pants off of him. She rips
open his shirt -- the buttons fly off. In seconds, they're
both naked.

Ann straddles Marty.... grinds her hips into him... She
arches her back, pushes her breasts into his face... He pulls
her closer to him... Pushes deeper inside of her...

The bed starts to shake. The springs squeak. Sweat begins
to pour off of them as they claw at each other.
ut

They groan leuder, both racing toward climax. As they move
together in perfect rhythm we...

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Marty and Ann lay in bed, both spent and wearing expressions
of contentment.

MARTY
Did I tell you how glad I am that
you moved back here?

ANN
Well, that makes one of us.

MARTY
Come on, Quicho's not that bad.

She gives him a look as if to say, "who you kidding?"

MARTY
(laughs)
Alright, it's awful. But it's a
lot better with you here.

Marty's cell phone rings. He starts to get out of bed, but
is jerked back -- his right hand is handcuffed to the
headboard.

MARTY
Can you get that, babe?

Ann hops out of the bed and looks around Marty's discarded
clothes until she finds the cell phone. She tosses it to
Marty.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Chief Walsh.

Marty listens for a long beat.

MARTY (INTO PHONE}
I'm on my way.

Marty hangs up the phone.

MARTY
(to Ann)
Jay Guiney just tore up the
Crowbar again. I gotta put him in
the tank.

ANN
I don't think you're going anywhere.
Oy

She smiles and holds up the keys to the handcuffs.
EXT. DOWNTOWN QUICHO - DAY
Marty, in his button-less police shirt, walks down the

street, waving and talking to people. e stops ata
newspaper machine. Puts his quarter and grabs a paper.

 

 

INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - DAY

Marty is parked along a country highway, a radar gun sticking
out his window. Marty is reading the newspaper that he
bought. The lead story reads: "Sarcetti Found Guilty." A
picture of Marty testifying in court is tucked under the
headline.

A Ford Escort whips past Marty. The gun reads 70 MPH. Marty
starts up the truck, hits the sirens. Pulls out after the
Escort.

The Escort pulls over. Marty stops his truck. Jumps out.
EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Marty walks up to the Escort. The DRIVER flashes a cocky
smile at Marty. It's clear that there is no love lost
between these two.

DRIVER
Problem, Chief?

MARTY
You were speeding.

The driver is CHRIS HARRISON, Quicho's 1985 Homecoming King.
Chris is built like a brick shit-house, still waiting for
that day when they let 35 year old has-beens suit up for
their high school football team.

CHRIS (DRIVER)
C'mon. You're not gonna write me
a ticket for that.

MARTY
Chris, see, since you left town,
things have changed a little. We
actually made a new law -- now
speed limits apply to former high
school quarterbacks as well as
everybody else.

The unseen passenger laughs. And we recognize that laugh...
it's Ann. But instead of Marty flipping out at seeing his
lover in another man's car, Marty barely even looks at Ann.
 

C'mon, we're late for Ann's
doctor's appointment.

MARTY
(real concern)
Everything all right?

ANN
(leans forward)
I'm fine, Marty.

Chris pats Ann’s knee. Ann moves her leg so that Chris’ hand
falls off. Marty rips up the ticket.

MARTY
I'm gonna let you off with a
warning. Consider it your welcome
home present, Chris.

CHRIS
(under his breath)
Fuck you.
MARTY —
What?
CHRIS
I said, "thanks."
MARTY
You should put your seatbelt on,
Ann.
(beat)
Chris, you can keep yours off.
ANN
(smiles)

Thanks.

Marty tips his hat and walks back toward his car. As Marty
walks back to his truck, he lowers his mask. It kills him
that Ann is married to Chris.

In the b.g. Chris peels back onto the highway. By the time
he's out of sight, he's going faster than when Marty pulled
him over.

EXT. QUICHO'S POLICE STATION - DAY

Marty pulls up. A beat-up Mazda RX-7 is parked in Marty's
clearly marked parking spot. Marty turns into another space,
but makes sure that he leaves a nice dent on the Mazda's back
bumper.
eo

INT. QUICHO'S POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Marty walks in, carrying the radar gun.

TONY DALTEN, Marty's second in command (and Quicho's only
other. full time cop), sits at his desk. Tony's at the age
where he's more concerned about fighting acne than fighting
crime.

MARTY
Hey, T. Chae here?

TONY
(nods)
Bathroom.

Dr. CHAE YI walks out of the bathroom, a newspaper tucked
under his arm. He's the county coroner and Marty's best
friend. -

Chae is an Asian man who could be anywhere from 30 to 60.
His steady diet of nicotine and alcohol have virtually
guaranteed that he'll be on the receiving end of an autopsy
in the next couple of years.

He walks over to Marty, wipes his wet hands on Marty's shirt.

CHAE
You need paper towels.

MARTY
(gestures to parking lot)
Maybe I'll buy ‘em with the money
I get from your parking ticket.

Marty walks into his office, Chae on his heels.
Chae holds up the newspaper with Marty's picture on it.

CHAE
I thought the camera only added
ten pounds.

MARTY
I was wondering how long it was
going to take you to bring that up.

CHAE
Maybe now is a good time to
revisit my offer to invest the
money --~-

MARTY
"Investing?" I always thought it
was called "misappropriation of
funds."
w

CHAE
Seven hundred grand in a stock
fund, figure ten percent return
over a year. Dean could set it up.

MARTY
You mean Dean could launder it.

CHAE
You say "to-mato", I say "tom-ato."

MARTY
(deadpan)
Let's call the whole thing off.

CHAE
This could be our seed money.

TONY
(laughing)
You two still going to Costa Rica
to open that fishing business?

MARTY
(taps his watch)
T, it's almost two-thirty.

Tony nods glumly as he grabs a crossing guard sash anda
handheld stop sign off the wall. He checks his gun to make
sure it's loaded.

MARTY
Make sure you shoot to kill out
there.
Tony leaves.
CHAE

I spoke to my buddy who runs the
charter business there--

MARTY
"Buddy?" You met him in a chat
room.

Marty goes to a wall-size safe. Marty dials the combo, then
unlocks it with a key. He opens the safe, walks in. Chae
follows behind him. The safe is the evidence locker.

EVIDENCE LOCKER

The evidence locker is sparsely filled with a collection of
guns, knives, and other odd pieces of evidence. But Chae is
not interested in any of that. He is looking at a large
evidence bag of $100 bills. The bag is marked, "Sarcetti
case - No. 23432."
CHAE
You know it's very tough to
extradite from Costa Rica.

Marty ignores him, puts the radar gun on a shelf.

CHAE
What the hell they gonna do with
the money anyway? Print up some
"Just Say No" bumper stickers.

MARTY
f£ they do, I'll make sure you get
a whole bunch.

Marty pushes Chae out of the evidence safe. Locks it.

CHAE
(defeated)
Ten years we've been talking about
this. About getting out of here.

Chae's cell phone rings. He answers it, listens for a beat,
then hangs up.

CHAE,
Shit. What kind of prick dies
this late on a Friday afternoon
before a three day weekend?

MARTY
The nerve of some people.

Chae walks out of the station. Marty sits down at his desk.
Chae walks back in.

CHAE
Hey.

Marty looks up to see Chae giving him the finger.

CHAE
Thanks for the dent, asshole.

INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Marty sits on a tired couch, talking on the phone and looking
at his Palm VII.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Hey, T. It's me. How's
everything at the office?

TONY (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Uh, good, good.
MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Great, great. Then I just have
one question for you? Why the
hell are you at the god damn diner!

MARTY!'S PALM: The GPS (Global Positioning System) module is
activated. He's looking at a map of Quicho. Tony is
represented by a blinking blip on the screen.

TONY (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Shit!

Knock-knock. Marty looks up. Ann walks in.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Get your ass back there, T.

Marty hangs up, then walks over to Ann. She looks troubled.

MARTY
You okay?

ANN
Can you take a ride with me?

INT. ANN'S CAR - NIGHT

Marty and Ann drive into Detroit. The skyscrapers tower
around them. They drive in silence. Marty starts to say
something, but stops himself. They pull into a hospital
parking lot.

MARTY
(nervous)
Annie. What's going on?
EXT. PARKING LOT / DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Marty and Ann walk toward the hospital.
ANN

Can you walk a little behind me?
This is Chris's hospital.

MARTY
He's working now?
ANN
No, I'm just worried about his

friends.

Ann walks into the hospital. Marty waits a beat and then
follows.

INT. DETROIT MERCY - DAY
Ann talks to a nurse. Marty hangs back. He noticés a sign
above the nurses' station: Oncology Department.

MARTY
(under his breath)
Shit.

Ann comes back out. Marty follows Ann downstairs.
INT. HOSPITAL - BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

It's almost empty. Ann and Marty walk into...

DR. FRIELAND'S OFFICE

A small, cramped office. Furniture and files are scattered
everywhere. ivy League diplomas dominate the walls. DR.
FRIELAND looks up when they enter the room. Frieland is in
his mid 30s. And he seems very nervous. He plays with a
bronze letter opener, turning it in his fingers.

DR. FRIELAND
Ann.

ANN
Hi, Bob.

They hug.

ANN
(re: office)
Who'd you piss off?

DR. FRIELAND
(forces a laugh)
They've got me down here in the
dungeon while they fix up my
office.

ANN
{re: Marty)
This is my brother Marty.

Marty and Dr. Frieland shake hands.

DR. FRIELAND
Bob Frieland.
(gestures to seats)
Please.

Ann and Marty sit down. Frieland pulls a file off his desk,
studies it. Starts to say something and then stops. Goes
back to the file.

DR. FRIELAND
Ann. I'm afraid, well, ah...
there's been a bit of a setback...
Marty looks at Ann. But she doesn't meet his eyes. She
steels herself. Whatever Frieland is about to say, she's
been expecting it.

ANN
So this visit isn't just to pad
your bill?

DR. FRIELAND

(weak smile)
I'm, uh, afraid not.

(beat / refers to charts)
The cancer's not in remission. In
fact, it's come back very
aggressively. It's attacked your
liver and lungs...

Marty looks worse than Ann. He's devastated. Watching as
his world comes crashing down.

ANN
How long?

DR. FRIELAND <<
Well, that's difficult--

ANN
Come on, Bob. What'd we agree to
when I first came to you?

DR. FRIELAND
(smiles)
No bullshit.

ANN
So...

A long, tortured beat of silence. Dr. Frieland spins the
letter opener in his fingers.

DR. FRIELAND
(pains him)
Six months...
Ann shakes her head, refuses to believe it.

ANN
But I feel fine--

DR. FRIELAND
And you will... for a little while
longer.

Ann reaches out, grabs Marty's hand.
ANN
(trying to smile}
Next time, give me the bullshit,
Doc.

Frieland goes over to her, puts a hand on her arm.

DR. FRIELAND
Ann, there's a counselor here at

the hospital I'd like you to see.
She's, uh, she's... very good.

But Ann's no longer listening. She stares out the window.
Marty tries to console her, but she doesn't respond.

After a beat, Ann stands up, extends her hand to Dr. Frieland.

ANN
Thanks for staying so late to see
me, Bob.

DR. FRIELAND
Ann... This is not--

ANN
I appreciate everything you've
done for me. I really do.
{turns to Marty)
Can we go now?

DR. FRIELAND
Ann, please--

ANN
(to Marty)
I'd like to go.

MARTY
Wait a second.

Ann turns and leaves. Marty turns to Frieland.

MARTY
There's gotta be something--
Frieland shakes his head slowly -- this is the toughest part
of his job.
MARTY

What about different doctors?

DR. FRIELAND
She's been to New York, to the
Mayo Clinic--
us

MARTY
What about experimental
treatments? You know, that stuff
you see on "60 Minutes?"...

A long beat.

DR. FRIELAND
(shakes his head)
I'm so sorry.

Marty stands there, absorbing it. He drops his chin to his
chest, takes a deep breath. Dr. Frieland puts his arm on
Marty's shoulder.

MARTY
Thanks, Doctor.

Marty stumbles out of the door.
EXT. PARKING LOT / DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - DAY

Ann leans against her car. Her tough facade has crumbled.
She's bawling. Marty runs up to her. He's crying, too. He
buries her head in his chest as she cries even louder.

ANN
(after a beat)
I locked the keys in the car.

After a beat, they both start laughing their tears.
INT. ANN'S CAR - NIGHT

Marty drives in silence. Ann stares out the window. Marty
keeps stealing glances at her. His heart is breaking. She
catches him looking at her. She takes his hand.

MARTY
Why didn't you tell me, Annie?

ANN
Because when I was with you, I
forgot about it. For a couple of
hours, I didn't think about dying.
I just, I... You made me feel good.

She squeezes his hand. They pass a sign that reads,
"Entering Quicho."

MARTY
This why you came back?

ANN
No. We came back because we lost
our house.
ov

MARTY
Chris's gambling?

ANN

(nods)
And since I couldn't sell my mom's
house, I figured we might as well

live in it. So, I was born in
this shitty town and now I'm gonna
die in this shitty town.

MARTY
Don't say that.
ANN
What? This place is shitty.
MARTY
You know what I mean.
ANN
It doesn't matter if I say it or
not.
(resigned)
I'm dying.
MARTY
We'll go to other doctors--
ANN
(laughs)

I've been to ten doctors in three
states, Marty. And the only thing
that changes is the magazines in
the waiting rooms.

She stares out the window. He reaches over and grabs her
hand.

INT. MARTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
They lie in bed, both lost in their own thoughts. After a

beat, Marty leans over and kisses Ann's forehead. Pulls her
closer to him. She kisses his chest.

MARTY
Let's leave.

ANN
What?

MARTY

You said you didn't want to die
here. Well, let's leave.

ANN
And go where?
MARTY
Wherever you want. The Caribbean,
Europe...

Ann kisses him softly. She's touched by the gesture, but
knows that it's not realistic.

ANN
Should we take your millions or
mine?

MARTY

We'll figure out the money.

ANN
Well, it won't take us long to
figure it out since your ex-wife
gets most of your money and Chris
bet all ours on losing football
teams.

Ann pulls his face to hers. Kisses him.

ANN
(beat)
Marty, I can't leave with you. I
mean, this, this is great, but
it's not real.

MARTY
Not real? Ann, I've been in love
with you since we were in first
grade.

ANN
(smiles)
Mrs. Green's class, right?

Ann pulls herself up in bed, clutching the sheet to her. She
grabs her panties and pulls them on. Stands up and starts to
get dressed.

MARTY
Where you going?

ANN
I don’t think we should do this
anymore.

MARTY
What?!

ANN
It wasn't right for me to drag you
into this.

Marty swings out of bed, grabs her arms.
o

MARTY
"Drag me into this?" Are you
kidding? This past month has been
the best month of my life. Hell,
this month has been better than

most of my years.

ANN
Marty, I'm dying...

MARTY
I don't care if you have six
months or six minutes left. I
just wanna be there for all of
them.

She gently takes his hands off her arm. Kisses him. Looks
into his eyes.

ANN
You know when you take off a band-
aid.
MARTY
(confused)
What?
ANN

It's always better to pull it off
quickly. [It might be painful, but
it's better than peeling it off
slowly.

MARTY
(starts laughing)
That is the worst example I've
ever heard.

Ann starts laughing, too. But she catches herself.

ANN
I'm sorry, Marty. I'm so sorry.

She kisses him again. Turns to leave.

MARTY
I'm tough. I can take the pain of
peeling it back slowly.

ANN
I'm the one wearing the band-aid.

She turns, heads for the door. Fights every urge to turn
back to him. By the time she reaches the door, the tears
have already started falling.
Marty watches as she disappears out the door. Continues to
stare even after he hears her car start.

INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Marty walks out of his apartment. Jumps into his truck. A
Post-It note is stuck to the steering wheel -- "I'm sorry.
Love, A". He stares at the note for a beat, then tosses it
to the cluttered floor.

INT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY
Marty fills out a card, attaches it to a bouquet of flowers.
INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - DAY

Marty drives an ELDERLY LADY home with her groceries. She
BLABS on, but Marty's not listening. All he can think about
is Ann.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Ann, dressed in a hygienist's uniform, talks with DR. SNYDER,
the dentist who owns the practice.
DR. SNYDER
Well, obviously your health is
the most important consideration.

A DELIVERYMAN brings in a large bouquet of flowers. Gives it
to Ann. Ann carries it over to her cubicle. NIKKI, a gum-
popping hygienist, comes over to check out the haul.

NIKKI
Oooh... nice. Lemme see.

Ann turns away, opens the card.

CARD: A band-aid is taped to the card. "Pull slowly” is
written on it. :

As hard as she fights it, a smile creeps out of Ann's mouth.
INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Marty flips through his high school yearbook. They might as
well have subtitled it, “A photo history of Ann & Chris's
senior year." They're in nearly every photo. Football
captain... Head Cheerleader... Homecoming King and Queen.
Marty flips to Ann's senior photo.

ANN'S SENIOR PHOTO: She's radiant. Under, "Plans for the
future", she's written, "Leave Quicho the day after
graduation."

Marty's cell phone rings. He jumps up, grabs it.
MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah.

He listens for a beat, then tears out of the apartment.
INT. ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Marty walks into the house.

MARTY
Annie...

@
K

No response. Marty follows the DRONING of a TV. Finds
in the kitchen.

KITCHEN

She notices Marty, gives him a weak smile. She looks bad:
thinner, dark circles under her eyes.

ANN _
I think he combined the "Death do
us part" and the "For richer or
poorer"...

She hands him a pile of papers. It's an insurance policy.
INSURANCE POLICY: Scanning over all the legal mumbo-jumbo.
Certain things jump out at us... INSURED: Ann Harrison...
BENEFICIARY: Chris Harrison.

But it's the amount that causes the record to SCREECH to a
halt in Marty's head: §$1,000,000.00.

MARTY
Jesus...

ANN
I just found it. It was locked in
his desk.

Marty continues reading the insurance policy. Ann gets up,
starts pacing. Her self-pity morphing into anger.

MARTY
You didn't know about this?

ANN
(shakes her head)
I remember signing some things,
but he told me it was about health
insurance.

MARTY
{reading policy)
He just took this out six months
ago...
ANN
I know. My cancer probably saved
me from a "fall" in the shower.
God, it's so typical of him, too.
(bitter laugh)

How many dental hygienists do you
think are insured for a million
dollars?

Ann stops pacing, starts crying. She laughs to cover her
ing. Marty kisses the top of har head. She looks up at

  

ANN
Can I ask you something? Were you
serious when you said you would
leave with me?

Marty nods. He was never more serious about anything in his
life.

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Chris's car pulls in the driveway. He gets out.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Ann hears the front door open. She panics. Pushes Marty
towards the back door. He resists.

MARTY
No.
ANN
Please.
MARTY
(holds up the insurance
policy)
We're gonna have this out. Right
now.
ANN

If we're gonna leave, he can't
know. He can't know.

(beat)
Please...

After a beat, Marty gives in, leaves out the back door.
She shuts the door just as Chris walks into the kitchen.

CHRIS
Bee

ANN
Hi, I, uh, was going to take the
trash out.
She walks over to the garbage can.
ANN
I, uh, thought you were working a
double tonight.
Chris walks over to the door, looks outside.
EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Marty's just out of Chris' view.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Chris opens the garbage can. It's only a quarter full.
Chris moves in close to Ann, forcing her into a corner.

CHRIS
How was-your appointment yesterday?

ANN
Appointment ?

CHRIS
With Dr. Frieland.

What? I, ah, didn't see--

ANN
CHRIS

Jay saw you going into his office.

Said you were going in with

another guy.

ANN
No, no... I stopped by. I, ah,
had some questions. But I, I was
by myself.
Chris grabs her arms, shakes her.
CHRIS
How can I help you, Annie, if
you're not honest with me?
EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
MARTY'S POV: Chris pushes Ann against the wall.

CHRIS (0.S.; MUFFLED)
Don't lie to me!

MARTY: Trying to decide what to do.

He runs around the house, goes to the front door. Rings the
doorbell. After a beat, Chris answers the door.
MARTY
(smiles)
Howya doing, Chris?

CHRIS
Chief.

MARTY
{gestures to their
neighbor's house)
Judy Anderson said she saw a
prowler outside her place. You
happen to see anything?
(Chris shakes his head
'no')
What about Ann? She home?

CHRIS
She didn't see anything.

MARTY
(laughs)
You didn't ask her.

CHRIS
She didn't say anything about it.

MARTY
Maybe I should ask her, you know.
Not that I don‘t trust your mind
reading abilities or anything.

Ann comes to the door. She and Marty share a quick look.
Marty looks her over, makes sure that Chris didn't hit her.

ANN
I didn't see anything.

Marty waits a long beat.

MARTY
All right. G'night then.
(starts away)
I'm just gonna be checking out the
woods. If you see something,
gimme a holler.

Chris shuts the door.

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE ~ LATER

Marty's in his truck, watching Ann's house through a set of
binoculars. The lights go off in the house. Marty starts up
his truck.

INT. THE CROWBAR - NIGHT
No Sam Adams or Heineken served here. Marty sits at
by himself, finishing up a Bud. Chris walks in. Mar
stares at him for a beat, then turns back to the basketball

highlights on TV.

 
  

 

Chris. walks over to the bar and sits next to Marty.

CHRIS
(re: TV, shakes head)
Pistons. I come back after ten
years and they still suck.

Marty shrugs.

CHRIS
Let me get you a refill there.

MARTY
I'm all set.

CHRIS
C'mon, it ain't a bribe.

Chris gestures for two beers to the bartender.

CHRIS
Lemme ask you something. Tonight,
when you were looking for that
prowler, did you see anybody else
out there?
(Marty shakes his head)
Nobody leaving my place?

MARTY
No, why?
CHRIS
I don't know why I'm even telling
you this.
(looks Marty straight in
the eye)

I had a feeling last night when I
came home that Ann was with some
other guy.

A beat.

MARTY
Really?

CHRIS
Yeah, and I think he snuck out the
back when I got home.
to
ut

MARTY
(pretends to think)
Didn't see anybody.
@ (beat)
What'd Ann say?

CHRIS
That I was crazy. She said she
was just taking out the trash.

MARTY
Maybe the garbage was full.

CHRIS
(laughs)
In the fifteen years we've been
married I can count the number of
times she took out the garbage on
my thumb.

MARTY
I didn't see anything.

Chris nods to himself.

CHRIS
Thanks, anyways.

@ The bartender brings their two Buds. Chris takes a long swig
of his beer.

CHRIS
I tell you, though, next time that
little pussy comes around I'll be
waiting.

MARTY
"Little pussy?"

CHRIS

Sure, he scurried out the back
door the second he heard my voice.
I mean, I could almost respect a
guy who had the balls to confront
me, to tell me, “Yeah, I'm fucking
your wife." Right?

(Marty shrugs)
Like that guy who was fucking Amy.
I mean, shit, that had to kill
you, that your wife's fucking some
guy. But still, I mean, you gotta
respect that guy a little, right?

@ Chris smiles at Marty.
MARTY

Maybe Ann is fucking somebody.

Except, that unlike my ex-wife,
& your wife won't let this guy tell

you that you're a shitty husband

and you don't deserve Ann. Maybe

there's nothing he'd rather do

than walk up to you, look you in

your eyes--

(Marty stares into Chris‘

eyes)
And say, "Chris, I'm fucking your
wife." Is that what you'd want?
Chris LAUGHS.
CHRIS

I'd respect him at least. And if

he did, I'd look him in the eye--
(stares at Marty)

And say, "if you ever come near my

wife again, I'll kill you."

They stare at each other for a long beat.

MARTY
I think you're telling the wrong

@ guy here, Chris.

A beat, then Marty taps his gun.

MARTY
Because as a cop, I can't let you
go around making threats on
people's lives. If I thought you
were serious, I'd be obligated to
do something.

CHRIS
Lucky for both of us, I don't
think we'll have to find out how
serious I am. I think Ann
understands where I'm coming from.

Marty finishes his beer and stands up.

MARTY
Thanks for the beer, Chris.
CHRIS
Thanks for listening.
e Marty starts for the door, then turns and stops.
MARTY

Give Ann my best, willya Chris?
INT. MARTY'S CFFICE - DAY
Marty is talking on the phone.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Deano, it's Marty. Listen, does
your dad still rent his house on
the lake?... Really. What's his
number?

Marty writes the phone number down. His other line rings.

MARTY
Thanks, Deano. Gotta run.
{picks up second line)
Chief Walsh.

ANN (0O.S.; ON PHONE)
We've got a change of plans...

EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN DETROIT - DAY

Marty and Ann walk down the street, hand-in-hand. Ann's a
bundle of nervous energy.

They stop in front of a brownstone. Ann checks the marquee:
"The Living Gift."

ANN
This is it.
They walk up the steps.
INT. LOBBY - THE LIVING GIFT - DAY

Ann and Marty are greeted by ROBERT GUILETTE, a tall,
impeccably dressed salesman. - Robert was put on this earth to
do one thing: sell.

ROBERT
Mrs. Harrison. Robert Guilette.
A pleasure to meet you.
(to Marty)
And this must be your husband.

Marty gives Ann a quick look. She shrugs, 'go with it.'
MARTY
(smiles)
Yeah. Chris Harrison. Nice to
meet you.
INT. OFFICE - THE LIVING GIFT - DAY

Marty and Ann sit in the dark, watching a slide show.

ROBERT (0.S.)
These are just some of the
people we've helped.

Robert turns on the lights. And here's the pitch...

ROBERT
Ann, a viatical settlement is all
about opportunity. About giving
you the opportunity to do things
that you've only dreamed of,
whether that be walking along a
deserted beach in Hawaii or
running with the Bulls in Pompeii--

— ANN
Pamplona. The buils run in
Pamplona. The volcano erupted in
Pompeii.

Robert LAUGHS.

ROBERT
My point was -- before the
geography lesson -- the only limit

is your imagination.

ANN
And by how much money you offer
me, right?

ROBERT
Someone's done their homework.

ANN
Okay, let me make sure I've got
this straight. I name you the
beneficiary on my life insurance
policy--

ROBERT
Well, not me personally. You name
the Living Gift as your
beneficiary. After, of course, we
purchase your policy from you.

ANN
And you-- I mean, the Living Gift--
collects on the policy when I die.
nw
wo

ROBERT
(nods)

As the beneficiary, we collect on
6 the policy after you've passed on,

yes.

However, I want to take this

opportunity to assure you, at the

Living Gift maximizing profits is

not our objective. Last year our

return on investment fell below

that of the average mutual fund.

ANN
How much do I get?

Robert smiles, waits a beat. Knows he's got her.

ROBERT
We determine the buyout after your
consultation with our medical
staff.

ANN
And the amount depends on how long
your medical staff says I have to
live, right?

ROBERT
& (laughs)
It's dependent on a variety of
factors. But yes, life expectancy
is one of the many factors we
consider.

ANN
How about a ballpark figure?

ROBERT
Now don't quote me on this. But
people who are generally in your
category--

ANN
My category?

ROBERT
Those whose life expectancy falls
below, ah, your ah, expectancy,
ah, six months... the standard
payout for this category.is
between seventy five and eighty
percent of the policy.

@ It doesn't take long for Ann to do the math in her head.

ANN
Seven hundred and fifty thousand?
Robert nods slowly. Ann's trying to temper her enthusiasm.

ROBERT
Now, if this is something you're
interested in, we just have to
move quickly.

ANN
(smiling)
Yes.
(beat)
Is that quick enough?

ROBERT
You can sleep on it--

ANN
I don't need to. I -~.I mean my
husband and I -- want to do this.

EXT. THE LIVING GIFT - DAY

Ann and Marty walk out of the office. Well, Ann practically
floats out. As soon as they're outside, she jumps into
Marty's arms and lets out the loudest scream of joy you've
ever heard.

EXT. DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Chris, wearing a security guard uniform, walks out of the
employee parking lot.

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Chris flips through "Car & Driver" magazine, ocogling the
expensive sports cars.

CHRIS
Yeah, yeah, a Humvee. That's the
one...
A MORGUE ATTENDANT walks into the office.

ATTENDANT
Hey, little help here, Chris.

Chris nods and walks out of the security office. Another
Attendant stands over a gurney holding a body bag, waiting to
go into the morgue. Chris unlocks the morgue door.

INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Boxes are everywhere. Marty is packing his apartment up.
The phone RINGS.
MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah.

As he listens, his face registers bad news. He runs out the
door.

INT. ANN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marty's trying to console Ann. She looks awful -- a mixture
of desperation and anger. Ann starts pacing.

MARTY
What'd Robert say?
ANN
One of their investors pulled all
his money out... they're broke.
MARTY

We'll go somewhere else. Have
someone else buy your policy.

ANN
I can't go anywhere else. There's
only two days left to change the —
policy.
MARTY
What do you mean?
ANN
There's some provision in the
policy -- the beneficiary can't be

changed after six months. And
that's in two days--

MARTY
We'll call 'em. There has to be
something--
Ann turns on him, channeling all her anger at Marty.

ANN
It's too late!

She grabs a glass. Hurls it against the wall. SMASH!

Marty tries to touch her, but she shakes him off.

MARTY
Maybe--

ANN
Don't!

MARTY

There's got to be--

ANN
{holds up her hand)
Don't. This is not fixable.

Marty looks at her for a beat. Then he takes the broom and
dustpan out of the closet. Starts cleaning up the glass.

 

Ann watches m. But instead of being touched by this small
gesture, it pisses her off.

ANN
(cold)
I don't need you to clean up my
messes.

Marty continues sweeping. She takes the broom away from him.
Their eyes lock.

She puts the broom in the closet. She turns and walks out of
the kitchen.

Marty watches her go. Then, after a beat, he grabs the broom
and dustpan. Finishes cleaning up the glass. 0O.s. Ann's car
peels out of the driveway.

INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Marty's on the phone. After a beat, Ann's machine picks up.
Marty hangs up.

INT. POLICE STATION -~ NIGHT

Marty locks a DRUNK in the cell. He takes the Drunk's wallet
into the evidence safe. He lingers for a bit, staring at the
evidence from the Sarcetti trial -- the $660,000. He picks
up a stack of $100 bills. Stares at it.

INT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Marty directs traffic. He catches a glimpse of Ann and Chris
down the street. Ann looks awful. The last twenty-four
hours have seemingly aged her twenty-four years.

Marty tries to make eye contact with her. Just wants some
acknowledgement. But he doesn't get it.

INT. POLICE STATION ~ NIGHT

Marty's laying on the cot in the cell, staring blankly at the
TV. He looks like shit.

The front door opens. It's Ann.

She smiles weakly at Marty, walks up to the cell. She looks
just as bad as Marty.
ANN
What'd they lock you up for?

MARTY
Ignored somebody.

ANN
(smiles)
I thought that was just
misdemeanor?

»

MARTY
Nope. It's a felony in this town.

ANN
Didn't realize the punishment was
so stiff.
(beat)
Do we have to keep talking like
this? .

Marty smiles, shakes his head.
ANN
I'm sorry, I just... I just needed
some time.

She pulls a bundle of papers from her purse, pushes them
through the cell bars to Marty. He looks at the papers, then
at Ann.

MARTY
What's this?

PAPERS: Ann's insurance policy. Marty's listed as the
beneficiary.

ANN
My going away present.

Marty stares at the policy for a long beat.
He's moved by Ann's gesture.

ANN
Buy that fishing boat you and Chae
have always been talking about.

MARTY
You can't--
ANN
Please.
(beat)

Hey, name the boat after me, okay?

Ann doesn't look at Marty as she turns to leave. His hand
shoots out of the cell, grabs her arm.

Pt

MARTY
You can't leave.

ANN
I can't stay here any more. I
need some... peace. I talked to
a friend who lives in Chicago.
I'm going to stay with her--

MARTY
You're not going--

ANN
Please, don't make this harder...

Marty sticks his hand outside the cell, tries to unlock it,
but the key is stuck. He jingles the key around.

MARTY
Can you-help me here?

Ann plays with the keys, finally unlocks the cell.

MARTY
You can't leave.
ANN
Marty--
MARTY
You wanna know why you can't leave?
(beat)

‘Cause we're leaving.

ANN
What?

Marty gives her the insurance policy back.

MARTY
And you can't give this to me.

Marty leads her into his office. He unlocks the evidence
safe... walks in. Gestures for Ann to follow.

EVIDENCE SAFE

MARTY
Because I'm going to buy it from
you.

Ann stares at the Sarcetti money, shocked. After a beat, his
plan dawns on her. She starts shaking her head.

ANN
No. I can't-- I won't let you do
that .

A window's been smashed in. Marty and Tony look at the
evidence locker. There's crowbar marks all over it.

Marty takes the $660,000 out of the safe.

I'm gonna put this in a safe
deposit box at the bank...
Marty puts the money into a briefcase.

Ann and Marty sit at the kitchen table, staring at the
$660,000 in the duffel bag.

ANN
What if they want it back?

MARTY
By law, the money has to stay in
the possession of the arresting
department for one year from the
conclusion of the trial.

It's all yours.

ANN
(kisses him)
No, it's all ours.

I better get going.
Marty gets up and kisses her.
MARTY
Chris still working the graveyard

He's on at ten.

Then we'll leave at eleven.

Ann walks over, kisses him.

No, our life starts tomorrow.

INT. MARTY'S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

Marty drinks a beer with Tony.
TONY
How long do you think you're gonna
be taking care of your mother?

MARTY
Not sure, T. Probably five or six
months.

TONY

Cancer, man...

MARTY
So you ready to be acting Chief or
what?

TONY

I think so.

MARTY
You're gonna do good.

Marty stands up. Tony follows. They share a quick embrace.

Marty heads for the door.
MARTY
Don't let Chae off on those

INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT .- NIGHT

Marty hangs up the phone. Rubs his face, worried. He
glances at his watch -- 11 PM. Starts pacing.

EXT. ANN'S STREET - NIGHT
Marty parks down the street from Ann's place.
EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ann and Chris's cars are in the driveway. But no lights are
on in the house. Marty quietly approaches the house.

Marty sneaks around the house, looks in windows -- nobody's
home. He tries to open the windows. No luck -- they're all
locked.

Something catches his eye on the ground: an electronic hotel
key (the ones they magnetically charge) with "Ramada Inn"
written across it. He picks it up, looks at it. Pockets it.

Marty dials Ann‘s number on his cell phone again. It just
rings and rings...
 

INT. ANN'S NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
An ELDERLY WOMAN walks to the window. Looks out.

ELDERLY WOMAN'S POV: Marty, standing under a light, tries
the back door -- it's locked. She has a perfect view of him.

Marty looks up. Sees the old woman staring at him. He
quickly jumps back into the shadows and heads off.

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Marty hurries back to his truck.
INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - NIGHT
Marty's looking at the Ramada Inn hotel key.
MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah. Do you have a guest by the
name of Ann Harrison there?... How
about a Chris Harrison?...
Nothing, huh.
Marty hangs up, tosses the key on the floor.
INT. MARTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (3:02 AM)
Marty paces his barren apartment as he talks on the cell phone.
MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah, Tone, it's me. You hear of
any accidents or anything tonight?
He hangs up, dials Ann's number again. Gets the machine.

He kicks his suitcase across the room.

MARTY
Fuuuuck!

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (6:45 AM)

Marty's truck slams to a stop outside Ann's house. Or more
accurately, what used to be Ann's house...

The house is completely burned down.

Quicho's rag-tag volunteer fire department finishes watching
the house burn. The fire hasn't spread to their neighbor's
house.

Marty jumps out of his truck, runs up to the smoldering
house. He grabs the FIRE CHIEF (Paulie).

MARTY
Paulie... where?

The Fire Chief leads Marty over to the debris. They stomp
through the embers, come up to: TWO CHARRED CORPSES. Burned

beyond recognition.

MARTY: Turns away from the corpses and PUKES all over the
Fire Chief's boots.

FIRE CHIEF
Jesus, you all right here, Marty?

MARTY
Yeah... Just...

FIRE CHIEF
I'll grab ya some coffee.

The Fire Chief leaves Marty staring at the corpses. He
starts shaking his head slowly. Trying to remain composed.

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (7:24 AM)

Marty, devastated, leans against Ann's car, talking with the
Fire Chief.

MARTY
...The propane tank?

FIRE CHIEF
(nods)
I just woke up Jack. He said
Chris called last week saying he
wanted his tank looked at, been
having some problems with it.

Marty nods, walks over to where the corpses lay. He stares,
numb.

CHAE (O0.S.)
Who ordered them weil done?
Fy
oO

Marty turns, grabs Chae by the collar.

MARTY
How about showing a little fucking
respect?

Marty shoves him to the ground and storms off.
EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - LATER (8:12 AM)

Marty watches as Chae's people load the corpses into a truck.
Chae walks up, notices how devastated Marty is.

CHAE
Sorry about that back there. I'm
an asshole...

Marty waves him off.

A van labeled "County Arson Investigation" pulls up to the
site. A police car with "Cole County Sheriff's Department"
painted across it pulls up right behind the arson van.

Detective ALEX COLE (early 30s) steps out of the passenger
side. Chae stares at her as she makes her way toward them.

His attentiveness is easy to understand. Even Alex's off-the-
rack pants suit can't hide the fact that she could be making
three times a detective's salary dancing at one of the local
gentlemen's clubs.

But the people who can't get past the Playboy figure are
usually the worse for it. Especially if they've committed
murder.

Alex does a double-take when she sees Marty. He recognizes
her as well.

MARTY
Hey.

ALEX
That's the kind of greeting I get?

She offers her hand. He shakes it limply.

ALEX
By the way, you owe me fifty bucks
for that room service bill.

Marty nods. Too devastated to have any interest in catching
up with Alex. She surveys the scene.

ALEX
Looks like somebody forgot to
listen to Smokey, huh?
Marty doesn't respond. She turns back to him.

ALEX
Smokey the bear. You know --
"Only you can prevent forest
fires."

Marty still doesn't respond. Alex waves her hand in front of
his face.

ALEX
Bear. Could talk. Anyway...

MARTY
Excuse me for a sec.

Marty heads off. Alex watches him for a beat.

FIRE CHIEF
-twaving his hands)
Detective.

Alex walks over toward the Fire Chief and two ARSON
INVESTIGATORS.

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (9:25 AM)

The two Arson Investigators stand with the Fire Chief,
sifting through the ashes, talking in HUSHED tones.

Marty leans against his truck by himself.

Alex WHISTLES at Marty, gestures for him. Reluctantly, he
walks over to them.

ALEX
Smokey wouldn't be happy at all.
(beat)
This was arson.

MARTY
What?!

EXT. ANN'S HOUSE - DAY (9:50 AM)

It's buzzing with activity. And at the center is Alex,
barking into her cell phone. Marty stands off to the side.
The fact that Ann and Chris were murdered has shaken him out
of his daze.

ALEX (INTO PHONE)
That's bullshit! I caught

this thing... Tell Yaeger to suck
my dick!... Fine, twenty-four
hours.

Alex snaps her phone shut, goes over to Marty.
ALEX
Listen, I've got 'til tomorrow
before the Sherriff pulls me for
the old boys club on this thing.
And if I run this thing out of my
office, they're gonna be trying to
trip me up. So if it's alright
with you, I want to run it out of
your place here.

Marty considers it a beat.
He wants to stay close to the investigation.

MARTY

ALEX
Good, I'll have some of my men set
up shop at your place.
(beat)
And why don't I ride back with
you. That way we can catch up on
old times.

INT. MARTY'S TRUCK - DAY (10:02 AM)

Marty stares out the window, preoccupied. Alex watches him.
She notices his Palm on the dashboard. She picks it up.

ALEX
(off Palm)
Yep, here's my number. Right
where I wrote it.

Marty doesn't answer. Alex continues to play with the Palm.
Opens the GPS application.

ALEX
Oh, you've got the GPS thing on
here. Pretty high-tech for a
bunch of hicks.

MARTY
We hicks prefer to be called
hayseeds.

ALEX

Oh, so he can speak...
She waits for Marty to say something. He doesn't.

ALEX
+... dust not much.

Marty nods his head. Alex laughs and goes back to the Palm.
Locate who? --
Tony." A beeping

 

PALM: Alex clicks “Lecate." A list pops ur
Tony, Ambulance, Fire Truck?". She clicks
blip appears on a map of Quicho.

 

ALEX
Tony your gay lover?

MARTY
(laughs)
He works for me.
(takes the Palm)
This thing allows me to track
wherever he is.

Marty tosses the Palm on the dashboard.

MARTY
Pretty useless. But Tony's
brother sells 'em and he gave us
a bunch of 'em so he could use us
in the advertising.

ALEX
(imitating advertising)
Local hicks -- I mean hayseeds --

swear by our GPS tracking system.

Alex looks at Marty, expecting a laugh. But he doesn't say
anything. His mind is back on Ann's death. Alex notices how
despondent and distracted Marty looks.

ALEX
You seem pretty shaken up by this.
You know ‘em well?

MARTY
(he shrugs)
Went to high school with them.
They had just moved back here a
couple months ago.

ALEX
So, any idea who did it?
Marty shakes his head -- he truly is at a loss.
MARTY
No idea.
ALEX

They have any enemies?

MARTY
No, nothing like that.

ALEX
Money troubles?
MARTY
Nothing I heard of.

ALEX
Either of them fucking around on
the side?

Marty hesitates for a beat.

MARTY
(shakes his head)
No. I always heard they had a
perfect marriage.

ALEX
(scoffs)
The perfect marriage? I thought
they stopped making those back in
the fifties.

Marty pulls up to the police station.
There's already three sheriff's cars here.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (10:18 AM)

Alex is huddled with Deputy BASTE, her second in command.
Baste (40s) is the kind of guy who is actually thankful he
doesn't have a sense of humor. When he isn't working as a
cop, Baste is at home cleaning his guns and watching "Cops."

Other DEPUTIES are taking over the office: talking on
phones, carrying in evidence.

MARTY'S OFFICE

Marty is oblivious te the activity. He's staring at a photo
of he and Ann. It still hasn't quite sunk in.

ALEX (O.S.)
Hey, lazy bones.

Marty hides the photo, spins around in his chair.
ALEX
I'm gonna go by their dentist's
Place to pick up dental records.
How ‘bout coming along?
Marty nods, then gets up.
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY (10:42 AM)

Dr. Snyder (Ann's boss) hands Alex two sets of dental records.
Marty stands there, feigning interest.

DR. SNYDER
Here you go.

Alex looks over the dental records

ALEX
How long had Ann worked for you?

DR. SNYDER
About two months. Ever since she
and Chris got back into town.

ALEX

Where's her desk?
DR. SNYDER

(pointing)

It was over there.
ALEX

"Was?" -
DR. SNYDER

She stopped working last week.
ALEX

She quit?
DR. SNYDER

Uh, kind of.

(beat, sadly)
Ann had terminal cancer.

ALEX
She was dying?

Dr. Snyder nods. Alex looks to Marty, who pretends to be
shocked.

DR. SNYDER
I think she was trying to keep it
quiet.

MARTY

Bruce, can you think of anybody
who would've wanted to kill her?

Dr. Snyder thinks for a beat, then shakes his head.

ALEX
Is there anything else you can
tell us? Weird behavior?

DR. SNYDER
(shakes his head)
Sorry.
NIKKI (0.S.)
I think she was having an affair.

r They all spin around. Nikki (the other hygienist) stands
there, chewing gum. Marty eyes Nikki warily.
ALEX
She told you she was having an
affair?
NIKKI

(shakes her head)
Nah, she wasn't too talkative with
me. I mean, we'd talk about
stuff, you know like what was
happening on our stories and
stuff. But I just got that
feeling you know, like sometimes
when she was on the phone she
would...

(whispers)
Talk real quiet and stuff--

Marty jumps in, not liking where this is going.

MARTY
("skeptical")
C'mon. She was whispering?
@ That's your proof, Nik?

ALEX
Any idea who it was?

NIKKI
(shakes her head)
Nah...
(snaps her fingers)
But he was classy. A couple weeks
ago she got this real nice thing
of flowers. Remember, Bruce?

Dr. Snyder nods. Nikki continues, emboldened.

NIKKI
And, I, uh, dated Chris back in
high school -- when they broke up
for a couple of weeks -- and Chris
definitely wasn't the type of guy
to send flowers.

Marty whips out his cell phone. Dials a number.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
e@ Hey, Nancy. It's Marty. Howya
doing?...
(more)
MARTY (cont'd; INTO PHONE)
Listen, uh, somebody sent flowers
to Ann Harrison a couple weeks
ago. Any idea who it was?...
{after a beat, for
Nikki's benefit)
Chris sent ‘em. Thanks.

Before Marty hangs up we hear:

VOICEMAIL LADY (0.S.; FROM PHONE)
Dial your password, then press
pound--

Marty hangs up.

MARTY
(sarcastically)
Thanks for all your help, Nik.

INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (10:45 AM)
Alex pulls onto a highway on-ramp.

MARTY
This isn't the way back.

ALEX
Snyder gave me the name of Ann's
doctor off her insurance forms.
I wanna find out about her cancer.

Marty shifts uncomfortably. He has no interest in meeting up
with Ann's doctor.

MARTY
Well, how 'bout dropping me off
then?

ALEX

What? You don't like hanging
around with me unless you've
downed six margaritas?

MARTY

I just don't think both of us need
to sit around reading "Highlights"
while we wait to talk to her
doctor.

(be at)
Plus, I only had a couple
margaritas.

ALEX
They were doubles.
 

MARTY
You gonna drop me off?

ALEX
I will if you can tell me why you
never called me after the
conference.

MARTY
I apologize.

ALEX
That's not a reason.
(beat)
Well, it's your loss. ‘Cause I
usually give it up on the second
date.

INT. DETROIT MERCY HOSPITAL - DAY (10:56 AM)

They walk up to the front desk. Marty looks around, trying
to figure out how to avoid seeing Ann's doctor. He sees
someone walk out of the bathroom.

MARTY
I gotta hit the head. I'11 meet
you in there.

Alex shrugs and Marty starts for the bathroom.

ALEX
(to receptionist
Where's Dr. Donovan's office?

RECEPTIONIST
(checking files)
Uh, let's sea... Oh, here it is.
Her office--

MARTY
(turning around)
"Her"?!
Alex and the Receptionist shoot Marty a dirty look.

ALEX
We can vote now, too, Chief.

RECEPTIONIST
(for Marty's benefit)
Her office is on the third floor.

ALEX
Thanks.

Alex starts for the elevators. Marty follows.
EX

(shakes her head)
A liar and a chauvinist. I sure
wish I knew that about you before
I invited you back to my hotel
room.

 

But Marty isn't listening. He's still wondering why the hell
Ann's doctor is a she.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY (11:05 AM)

Marty and Alex sit across from DR. DONOVAN (female, 40s.)
Dr. Donovan reads froma file.

DR. DONOVAN
It says here that Miss Harrison
chose me as her internist from the
HMO directory, but I've never met
her.

ALEX
She's never been here for an exam?

Dr. Donovan shakes her head. Marty is still trying to figure
out why they're talking to this doctor instead of Dr. Frieland.
ALEX
It just doesn't make any sense --
She was dying of cancer but she
never came into your office.

MARTY
Maybe she saw another doctor here?

Dr. Donovan goes over to her computer. Clicks a few buttons.

DR. DONOVAN
{off computer)
No, she's never been a patient at
this hospital.

Marty looks like he's going to puke for the second time today.

MARTY
Excuse me.

Marty lurches out of his chair.
Throws opens the door.
The two women watch him go, surprised by his exit.

HALLWAY

Marty staggers out of the office.
He steadies himself against the wall.
His brain is having a hard time processing what he just heard.

After a beat, Marty runs down the hall.
Hits the stairwe

  

STAIRWELL

Marty-bounds down the stairs.
Takes them four at a time.

BASEMENT

Marty emerges in the basement.
Runs down the hall.

Finds Dr. Frieland’s office
Throws open the door...

The office is completely empty except for a desk and chair.
INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Alex hurries down the hall as she talks into her cell phone.
ALEX (INTO PHONE)
Listen, I want you to find out who
her doctor is.

INT. DR. FRIELAND'S "OFFICE" - CONTINUOUS

Marty walks around the empty office in a daze.
Stares at the bare walls that used to hold Ivy League diplomas.

Then Marty grabs the chair.
Tosses it against the wall.
The chair is reduced to firewood.

Marty flips the desk over.

Starts kicking it.

And kicking it.

Out of breath, he backs into the wall.
Slumps against it.

Slides down to the floor.

Then something catches his eye on the floor next to the desk...

The letter opener that Dr. Frieland kept fiddling with.

Marty picks it up with his fingertips.
Turns it over, lets the light catch it...

There's fingerprints on it.
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY (11:13 AM)

Marty runs out of the hospital.
Jumps into the police car.

INT. POLICE CAR

Alex taps her fingers on the wheel.

Marty pats his stomach.

MARTY
Bad coffee.

Alex shakes her head and starts the car.
INT. POLICE CAR - DAY (11:20 AM)

They head into downtown Quiche.

Marty stares out the window, catatonic.
Ann's betrayal still sinking in.
Alex's cell phone rings.

ALEX (INTO PHONE)
Yeah... I don't give a shit.
Figure out who I have to blow to
get my phone records. _
MARTY: The words "phone records" shake Marty out of his trance.
Knows his number is all over those records.

ALEX (INTO PHONE)
listens for a beat)
Results, not excuses, Baste.
That's what they pay us twenty-
five grand for.
(listens)
We're pulling in now.

Alex snaps her cell phone shut.
ALEX
God damn phone company's dragging
their feet on the phone records.

Marty doesn't answer.
Alex looks over at him -- he's pale.

ALEX
(off his expression)
That must've been some bad coffee.

Alex pulls into the police station parking lot.
They hop out of the car.

EXT./INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Alex follows Marty up the stairs.
Marty opens the door and walks in.

BULLPEN

Baste and Tony talk with TWO WOMEN and a MAN.
wy

JUDY, ome of the women, turns around, sees Marty and waves.
JUDY
Hey, Chief.
MARTY!S FACE: Pure terror.

Marty turns away from Judy, bumping into Alex.

The other woman, JUDY'S MOTHER, turns around.
Just in time to see the back of Marty's head.
Now we realize why Marty turned away...

Judy's Mother is the one who saw him at Ann's last night.

The man is a SKETCH ARTIST.
He finishes his drawing and shows it to Judy's mother.

SKETCH ARTIST
How's this look, mam?

Judy's Mother scrutinizes the sketch (we don't see it.)

BASTE
(to Alex)
We've got an eyewitness here.

Alex looks at the sketch.
Marty turns to go, keeping his back to Judy's Mother.
Alex reaches out and grabs his shoulder.

ALEX
Take a look at this.

Alex holds out the sketch for Marty.

Marty turms around slowly, scratching an “itch" on his face...
So that he partially obscures: his face from Judy's Mother.

He looks at the sketch.

SKETCH: Looks like Marty in a general way.
Eighty year old eyes and a hack artist have spared him.

ALEX
Ring any bells?

JUDY'S MOTHER: Watches Marty.
She tries to get a good look, but his hand blocks her view.

Her synapses firing... where has she seen that face?
MARTY
(shakes his head)
Sorry.
TONY

Kinda looks like you, Chief.

MARTY
(forced laugh)
Yeah, if I was as ugly as you, T.

Marty turns to leave.

JUDY
Chief, I don't think you've met my
mother yet. She just came up from
Dearborn.

Judy and her mother approach Marty.
Marty turns so that Judy’s mother is looking at his profile.

MARTY
Marty Walsh. Nice to meet you.

JUDY'S MOTHER
Carol Anderson.

MARTY

Thanks for all your help, mam.
JUDY

Such a shame... They were so young.
MARTY

Awful. Excuse me, Judy.

JUDY'S MOTHER
You look very familiar--

MARTY
(snaps his fingers)
Yes, that's right. I met you at
the supermarket last week.

Judy's Mother tries to remember... is that it?

JUDY
I don't think so.

JUDY'S MOTHER
Supermarket?--

MARTY
Yes, out in front. It must've
been last Tuesday.

JUDY
But mother didn't get in until
Thursday.
Baste comes over, holding a book of mug shots.

BASTE
Mrs. Anderson, we need you again.

Marty seizes the moment to escape.
He turns and ducks into his office.
Judy's mother turns back to Marty, but he's gone.

MARTY.'S OFFICE
Marty grabs his phone, dials 411.

MARTY (INTO PHONE)
Yeah, the number for the Living
Gift in Detroit.

Marty dials the number -- it starts ringing.

Marty grabs a newspaper article off his corkboard.
It reads, "Police Make Drug Bust -- $660,000 Seized."
He reads the date off the article: May 15, 2001.

MARTY
(off article)
May fifteenth.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
The Living Gift.

MARTY
Yeah, uh, is, uh, Robert there?

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Who should I say is calling?

MARTY
Uh, Chris Harrison.

WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
One moment, please.

Marty digs through his files as he waits.

ROBERT (0.S.; ON PHONE)
This is Robert.

MARTY
Robert. This is, uh... Chris
Harrison. Ann Harrison's husband--

ROBERT (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Of course. How's Ann?

MARTY
She's ah... fine. Listen, I, uh,
this is a weird question, but did
you guys go bankrupt?

FILES: Marty pulls out his copy of Ann's insurance policy.
Technically he's a millionaire today.
ROBERT (0.S.; ON PHONE)
(laughs)
Bankrupt? If we did, somebody
forgot to tell me.

MARTY
Did, uh, did Ann talk to you after
we met?

ROBERT (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Of course. She called me with the
good news.

MARTY
"Good news?"

ROBERT (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Sure. That her doctors believed
she was going to make a full
recovery...

It hangs there for a long beat.

Marty scans Ann's policy, finds what he's looking for...

The date of inception: May 24th, 2001.

Less than a week after Marty made the drug bust.

MARTY
(sotto, off date)
Couldn't even wait a fucking week.

ROBERT (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Excuse me?

MARTY
Nothing.

ROBERT (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Well, needless to say, I'm very
happy for the two of you. It's a
miracle.

MARTY
Yeah. A real fucking miracle.

Marty slams the phone down.
Alex looks in at him.
He smiles, realizes he can’t freak out here.

Alex raps on Marty's door.

Yeah.

An Agent Stark from the DEA is on

MARTY
Who? —

MARTY
I'll tell you what. How ‘bout I
call you tomorrow and we'll figure
out a time--

AGENT STARK (0.S.; ON PHONE)
Chief. This had to be done the
day before yesterday.

MARTY
I'm sorry. But that evidence has
to stay in my possession for a
year--

AGENT STARK (O.S.; ON PHONE)

I guess I'm not making myself
clear here. This has been a two
year ongoing investigation.
I have the cooperation of the FRI,
the ATF, and two foreign
governments... So you'll have to
excuse me if I don't give two
shits about your rules of evidence.

(beat)
My men'll be up sometime this
aftermoon. Oh, yeah, and Chief?

MARTY
Yeah.

AGENT STARK (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Have a nice day.

Stark hangs up on the other end.

Marty holds the phone to his ear for another beat, dazed:

Marty nods, then hands Tony the letter opener.

Alex looks in at Marty and Tony, curious about the outburst.
Baste hurries over to Alex.

BASTE
I just got off the phone with her
doctor -- she's over at Detroit

Medical Center. Anyways, she says
that she's been Ann's doctor for
the past five years. And that as
of her last check-up three months
ago, Ann was perfectly healthy.

ALEX
She didn't have cancer?

Baste shakes his head.

ALEX
I pretended I was a size four
once, but why the hell's someone
gonna pretend they had cancer?

MARTY'S OFFICE

Sorry. I just thought these guys

No, no, I'm sorry.

Marty puts his arm around Tony's shoulder.

Tony nods and goes to the door.

MARTY
Hey, T, still friends, right?

Tony smiles and heads out.
Marty sits down at his desk.
There's no way he's going to be able to keep this up.

Where's she live?

CHAE
Over in Fallbrook.

ALEX
Number?

CHAE
Ah, 534-2348.

ALEX
And she'll say you were there all
night?
CHAE
Yeah, because I was.
Alex looks Chae up and down, doesn't believe he killed them.
ALEX
You should've told me about this
at the scene.
CHAE
And I would've if I didn't have
about fifteen drinks last night.

I need a statement.

Do it for you right now.

CHAE
How's your alibi?

MARTY
Home, by myself.

ALEX
She changed it?

EQUITY LIFE OPERATOR (O.S.; ON PHONE)
If she did, it hasn't made it into
our system.

ALEX
You mean it might be in the mail?

EQUITY LIFE OPERATOR (O.S.; ON PHONE)

Just a little.

No, I stole it. I'm going to
Costa Rica. You wanna come?

I'll call the manager at home

Marty claws at Cabot's face.

CABOT: Tightening his hands around Marty's throat.

MARTY: Works his hands down to Cabot's waist...
And grabs his balls.
Hard!

CABOT
Aaah!

Cabot reflexively lets go of Marty.
Writhes on the floor in pain.

Marty stands there for a beat, dazed.
Trying to suck in as much air as possible.

Cabot notices Marty's gun on the bathroom floor.
Reaches for it -- gets it.

Staggers to his feet.

Turns toward Marty.

But he never gets a chance to shoot.
Because Marty swings the top of the toilet at Cabot's head.

The 15 lb. porcelain top hits Cabot's face at about 65 mph...
o
No

And the laws of physics take over...
Bones crack, teeth shatter, blood splatters...

And Cabot falls backward into the bathtub...

CYYYH!

His neck snaps as he hits the bottom of the tub head first.

He walks over to the sink.

Hands shaking uncontrollably, he splashes water on his face.
He looks at his reflection in the mirror.

Not the same man he was this morning.

He pauses, notices something in the mirror.

He runs into the main room.

Grabs a metal briefcase that's tucked next to the dresser.
Tries to open the briefcase, but it's locked.

Because Cabot was up here taking

The unconscious Clerk is loaded into an ambulance.

CHAE (0.S.; ON PHONE)
So you killed your only
suspect? Well, not exactly the
way I would try and prove my
innocence--

It was self-defense.

CHAE (O.S.; ON PHONE)
But you got the money, right?

MARTY
Yeah.

CHAE (O.S.; ON PHONE)
Well get the hell out of here.

You want to stop for a cup of
coffee now?

ALEX
I need-my fix.

INT. DINER - DAY (4:25 PM)

Marty and Alex sit across from each other in a booth. Neither
say anything for a long beat. Marty keeps stealing looks at
Alex, trying to figure out if she knows or suspects that he's
involved.

MARTY
Is this how the Sheriff's
department recommends solving
murders now?

ALEX
Sometimes it helps me to step away
for a couple minutes.

(beat)
Though I do have an ulterior
motive.
MARTY

And I thought you just had a thing
for bad coffee.

ALEX
It's not that bad.
(beat, takes a sip)
Actually, it is pretty awful.

She pushes the coffee away.
ALEX

I just wanted you to know, at that
conference--
wo

MARTY
Listen, I'm sorry I never called
you--

ALEX
No, No. That's not what I mean.
I just wanted you to know, I'm
usually not that... forward.

MARTY
Except on the second date, right?

ALEX
That was a slight exaggeration to
make you feel stupid for not
calling me.

Alex smiles at him. And in spite of the day he's had, Marty
smiles back at her.

ALEX
Did it work?

MARTY
Depends on how slight of an
exaggeration it was.

Alex smiles coyly.

MARTY
It didn't need to work. Right
now, I'm thinking not calling you
was pretty much the stupidest
thing I ever did.

Alex blushes, touched. And Marty is speaking the truth. All
he can see in Alex is the road not taken. And unlike Robert
Frost, he regrets the hell out of his choice.

ALEX
Now if you said something like
that at the hotel, you wouldn't
have had to wait for the second
date.

MARTY
My kingdom for a time machine.

A beat. Then Alex slams the table in mock anger.

ALEX
So why the hell didn't you call
me?!
(he doesn't answer)
Were you seeing somebody else?
Marty considers how much he should tell her. After a beat,
he nods.

MARTY
It started right after I met you.

ALEX
(afraid to ask)
You still seeing her?

MARTY
{laughs wearily)
No. No, it's definitely over.

ALEX
I'm sorry. Well, actually I'm
not. I mean--
(quickly to cover)
Did it end badly?

MARTY
(another weary laugh)
Yeah, you could say that.

Alex reaches over, takes Marty's hand. She thinks his weary
laugh is a way to mask the pain. Marty looks down at her
hand on top of his. Can't help thinking of the last woman
who comforted him. But when he looks up at Alex's eyes he
sees something he never saw in Ann's -- genuine affection.

The moment is interrupted by Alex's ringing cell phone.

ALEX (INTO PHONE)
Yeah...
(listens for a beat)
We're on our way.

Alex snaps her phone shut.

ALEX
That was Baste. Our buddy Cabot
made some calls from the hotel
before he went to Heaven.

MARTY

Alex pushes Marty toward his door.

ALEX
Why don't we go solve this thing?

Then maybe I'll crawl over you.

Marty hops out.

Alex slides over to his door.

A Post-It note from the floor sticks to her shoe.
Alex jumps out.
They start to walk toward the station.
Alex stops, mocices a Post-It stuck to the bottom of her shoe.
Marty, oblivious, heads into the station.

Alex grabs the Post-it.

It reads -- "I'm sorry. Love, A"
She stares at the Post-It for a long beat.
Wondering what we already know -- that the note is from Ann.

The pressure is taking its toll on Marty.
Alex walks into his office.

MARTY
Hey, any word on those phone

ALEX

They should have them soon.

MARTY
Good.

Alex watches him -- one thought running through her head...
Did he do it?

ALEX
Oh, and the hospital just called.
The clerk just woke up. He should
be here in like half an hour.

Alex watches his reaction -- did he wince?
MARTY
reat.
ALEX

Listen, I know it's premature.
But I just wanted to let you know
something about me.

  

MARTY
What's that?

ALEX
Honesty is really important to me.

They stare at each other for a long beat.
As they speak, neither breaks the stare.

MARTY
Honesty, huh?

ALEX
I've been burned before by guys
who weren't--

MARTY
Honest with you?

ALEX
(nods)
I dated a guy for three months
before I found out he was married.

MARTY
I'm not married.

ALEX
So, I just wanted you to know, if
there's anything going on with you
and your old girlfriend, please
tell me now.

Their eyes bore into each other.
Each waiting for the other to break the stare.

ALEX
‘Cause I'll understand. Just

MARTY'S FACE: Softening just a bit.
What if she's telling the truth?

ANN

Another day I couldn't stand
the thought of you leaving me.
So I figured, okay, I'll do it.
Chris and Cabot would get the
money. But you'd get the
insurance money. And you'd be
able to replace the money you
borrowed. And then, maybe, maybe,
when you found out I wasn't dead,
you might somehow, I don't know,
forgive me...

I didn't want you to to ruin your
credit by being late with your
electric bill.

Marty looks at the mail. Most of it, including his
Publisher's Clearinghouse Sweepstakes envelope, has been
opened already.

Long flight.

Marty flips through the mail.

Stops at one envelope.

Pulls a piece of paper out of the envelope.
Well, actually it's a check.

MARTY
Holy shit.

ALEX
Is everything okay.

MARTY
I think we're way past okay here.

It's a check for $1,000,000 from Equity Life Insurance
Company. The lower left corner of the check reads, "Policy
# 116423 - Ann Harrison."

FADE OUT:
THE END
