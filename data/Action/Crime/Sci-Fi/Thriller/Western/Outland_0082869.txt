TUESDAY, 4:15 P.M, lL.
EXT. GANYMEDE

Jupiter dominates the horizon...a titanic yellow-~
orange mass, covering most of the sky. Standing
on Ganymede...you have to look almost directly
upwards to see Jupiter's polar cap. :

The red spot swirls near the middle...like a giant
furious sore. Bands of colors stretch dcross the
surface...and bleed into one another. ..giving
warning of the violence that is occurring on the
surface.

You see this terrible, gaseous warfare going on...
and there is no noise. You know that there are
sounds down there that you don't ever want to hear.

Most of all, however, it is the sheer size of
Jupiter. It looms so enormous in the sky...that
you can feel its gravity. You sometimes are afraid
to jump from Ganymede's surface...afraid that you
will be sucked into Jupiter's pull...and be drawn
closer and closer...and then you will hear what it
really sounds like...and then you will be swallowed.

That is a fairly common phenomenon on Ganymede. It
is quite similar to the kind of disorientation skin
divers can experience. Most of the workers lose
their sense of up and down for a while...simply
because of the constant sight of Jupiter in the sky...
making them feel that they are going to fall inward,
rather than down.

They soon get over it.

The mine scales the sheer wall of the crater. The
platform glistens in the harsh half light from the low
sun. It contains a series of angular structures.

They are connected by what look like plastic vacuum
hoses...which are passageways.

The sunlight is almost always from the horizon...
causing elongated shadows. It kicks up brilliant pin
spots of white glare on the platform. There is an
overwhelming quality of impermanence to these
structures. The effect is almost like Dodge City in
the 1870's...this small temporary settlement of ugly
buildings...broiling in the sunlight, and freezing

in the shadow. . -
The scaffolding is orange oxidized metal...and it
stretches more than 200 feet down the inside wall of
the crater. The lower 100 feet are in total darkness..

and the men use brilliant work lights...which cast
bizarre shafts of yellow-white on the face of the
wall.

The mining equipment is all oversized. Gargantuan
yellow cranes on thick treads, crawl around the rin.
Pumps and generators pulsate in a web of intake and
outflow pipes that stretch from the crater to the
storage silos. It all looks like it was made by
Matell.

The workers wear color-coded environment suits. The
workers in the crater wear yellow. Equipment drivers
wear red. Maintenance personnel wear blue. Manage-
ment wear white. The suits are equipped with oxygen
tanks and heating units. Everyone has their name
stenciled on the left breast pocket.

All of the workers in the crater have safety tethers...
stretching from the scaffolding. Since there is one-
sixth gravity...men can float from one level to
another by a slight push. The only sounds we hear

are the constant crackling of static...and sporadic
dialogue...heard through the intercom systems.

We are on the ninth level of the scaffold. A line of
men are using electric arcs to cut into the rock. The
ninth level is in shadow...so the men are in the hot
pool of yellow work light. The harsh white sunlight
is streaking the upper part of the crater in the
background.

One of the men pushes off his platform...and floats
upward. It looks like everybody is under water.

WALTERS
No way. I told them no way
they're gonna bring an
automated vacuum loader here.

HUGHES
When they installed them on
14 and 23, they said it was
just a temporary experiment.
Well...they're still in there.
That's some temporary if you
ask me. Hand me that connector,
will you?

Walters places a thin metal object in Hughes’ glove.
We can see that both men are perspiring...causing
their face plates to fog up.

WALTERS
What about Wootton? He's the
shop steward...what did he say?

HUGHES
I'll tell you whet he said...
zip. That's what he said...
total zip.

WALTERS
They're always trying to pull
something. Like they don't
make enough dough already...
they have to try to keep
cutting corners.

HUGHES
Yeah, well it's a bunch of
crap. They got 7 worker
shifts on 14 and 23, ever
since they installed those
loaders. You read the by-laws.
8 workers for each shift...in
black and white...that'’s what
it says. 8 workers.

WALTERS
They want to get cute...we can
get cute too, I'm gonna tell
Wooton I want a meeting.
Maybe we need a new shop steward.
By-laws are by-laws. Jesus...
can't they regulate these suits...
minus a hundred seventy Goddam
degrees here...and we broil our
asses off.

A third man,..Tarlow...is working by himself...near

Hughes and Walters. Tarlow has stopped drilling...
and is putting his arc down.

HUGHES
Where's your other suit?

WALTERS
In the shop.

HUGHES
Put some mylar over the
sensor. It does something
to the heating coil...and
you stay cooler,

HUGHES
No, moron...I just made it

of the guys do it,

TARLOW

Oh!...I hate spiders!

Tarlow starts to stamp on the scaffolding metal platform...
as if he is trying to kill a spider.

Tarlow is

HUGHES
8 workers for 8 jobs. That's

WALTERS
Well maybe our shop steward

Hey Tarlow...what's eating you?

HUGHES
Kill what?

TARLOW
Oh God...I hate spiders!

WALTERS
You shitting us?

TARLOW
Oh! God! Get it off my
leg! Get it off!

Tarlow is flailing at his suit leg...pounding away at

the spider that we can't see.

HUGHES
Tarlow...what's the matter
with you? Get what off?

/ TARLOW
(screaming)
Spider! Please help me!

HUGHES
Spider? Have you popped
your cork? How can there
be a spider here. There's
nothin' alive here.

WALTERS
He's putting us on.

Tarlow writhes backwards...slapping at his chest now.

TARLOW
Goooddddddddddddd! Get it
ooooffffffifffffffffrffre!

HUGHES
very funny Tarlow. We're
not fallin' for nothin’.
Cut the garbage and get back
to work.

Tarlow grabs at the base of his helmet...near his

throat.

TARLOW
It's getting inside!!!!
It's getting inside!

He tries to dig inside his suit with his clumsy gloved
hands. He is seratching at his shoulder.

TARLOW
Get it cooonuuttttttttttt!
Oh Goodddddddddddddddittt!

Taxrlow lurches forward and grabs a sharp drilling bit.
He stabs at the shoulder of his suit...trying to
puncture the material.

HUGHES
Holy...Tarlow don't!

Both Hughes and Walters are too late,

Tarlow rips through the reinforced layers of the suit...
tearing a gash in the material near the base of his
helmet. It is almost instantaneous. There is no
pressure outside. All of the ‘air bursts through the
opening with a terrible woosh. Tarlow's face turns
crimson with the immediate build-up of blood trying to
burst through his veins. Everything is trying to get
out at the same time. He doesn't have time to scream.

His eyes explode from their sockets and smear against
the inside of his face plate. Red and grey pulp blast
through the holes in his skuil...and fill his helmet.

Tarlow's body tumbles forward over the railing. It
falls in slow motion down towards the bottom of the
erater...and then is jolted to a stop, as it reaches
the end of the tether. It dangles there...at the
bottom of this long green line...arms outstretched...
leaking a thick red syrup...making no sound. Ail we
can hear is the static.

CUT TO:

WEDNESDAY, 7:04 A.M. 2.
INT. O'NIEL QUARTERS MORNING

The interior of all the buildings resembles an aircraft
carrier. Everything inside is metal. The doors are all
bulkheads. Most of the ventilation system is exposed...
and runs under the low ceilings. O'Niel's quarters

are the typical officer quarters. It is a suite
consisting of two very small bedrooms, a bathroom with
astall shower, and a family room... consisting of a
Continued. 2.

kitchen area, a dining alcove, and a lounge-like alcove.
Almost everything is built-in...and is unfinished metal.
One wall has two television screens, a computer board,
and all of the environment controls.

Carol O'Niel is placing frozen waffles and a cup of
coffee into a microwave oven. She is a woman in her
middle thirties. She has dark hair...a lean figure...
and the kind of intelligent chicness that appears
somewhat out of place in this kind of situation. There
is an unmistakable melancholy about her that pervades
her movements.

Paul O'Niel is propping his eleven year old elbows on
the formica table...waiting for breakfast. He is an
alert little boy...with a sophistication that comes
from knowing more than he should know.

CAROL

Two minutes.
PAUL

Is it the buttermilk kind?
CAROL

‘ I'm afraid so.

PAUL

Yuck.
CAROL

Supply said they were running
out of the other ones.

PAUL
I can hardly talk with these
braces,

CAROL

I know...I'm sorry. It won't
be too much longer.

PAUL
How much longer?

CAROL
Pretty soon,

PAUL & CAROL
(together)
How soon?
Continued. 2.
Paul smiles.

O'NIEL
How soon for what?

William Thomas O'Niel strides into the room. He is an
atnletic looking man in his forties...with a hard kind
of grace to him. He is a man who doesn't seem to fit
too well in things like chairs or rooms, That quality
comes from his looks...not his size. He looks like he
belongs outdoors...especially when he is indoors.

PAUL
Till I get my braces off?

O'Niel snaps on one of the television screens...and
punches in a code on the computer.

O'NIEL
You want crooked teeth?

- PAUL
I don't mind them.

O'NIEL
You're going to be missing
some teeth in a minute, if
you don't eat your breakfast.
O'Niel reads the print-out on the monitor:
PROCEED
O'Niel types:
O'NIEL, W.T. MESSAGES?
The monitor answers:
O'NIEL, W.T. AFFIRMATIVE
Carol takes the breakfast out of the microwave oven and
places it on the table. Paul eyes the buttermilk

waffles as if they were alive.

CAROL
Pretend they're not buttermilk.

PAUL
Pretent I ate them.
Continued. 2.
Carol kisses his forehead.
A man's face appears on the monitor.

LOWELL
Marshal...it's Lowell. The
night watch went okay. Nothing
jauch..,just a couple of drunks.
fhe door to the purser in dome
9 has some chisel marks on the
hinges...may have been an attempt
to jimmy. No marks on the air
lock...we'll watch it tonight.
That's about it. I'll be in
your office at 1800.

Carol hands O'Niel his cup of coffee. The image on
the screen changes...to an older, man.

MONTONE
Marshal...it's Montone. Got
nothing more on that incident
in the mine yesterday. Looks
like it was just some guy who
went whacko. The Company is
having the body shipped
pack...or what's left of it...
immediately, on today's
shuttle. Christ, you should
have seen that mess.

Paul, who is having enough trouble with the waffle...
gives up and puts his fork on his plate.

MONTONE (cont'd)
aAnyway...definitely no homicide.
There were two witnesses right
next to him when it happened.

It happens every once in a while
up here. Some people just let
this place get to them. Damn
shame...his year was almost up.
Impossible to do an autopsy.

So that's about it...oh yeah...
tell your wife Transportation
got the tickets for her. See
you when you get to the office.
Don't worry..:you'll get used
to it.

The picture goes to black...and the screen reads:

)

END MESSAGES...O'NIEL, W.T.

Carol has lost the color in her face for a moment.
She quickly regains her composure. O'Niel turns the
monitor off.

O'NIEL
What tickets?

CAROL
Oh...Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds...
the nice couple from the
bakery...they wanted tickets
on the weekly shuttle for a
friend of theirs. I said I
would see what I could do.

O'NIEL shrugs...and finishes his coffee.

O'NIEL
I gotta go.

He kisses his son.

O'NIEL
See you for dinner, sport.
Don't forget...seven
pages of math.

PAUL
I promise.

O'Niel goes to the door. Carol looks at him for a
long moment...thengoes to him.

O'NIEL
You be good today.

He kisses her. She holds him tightly.

CAROL
I will.

O'NIEL
Look...I know this is a bleak
assignment. I know what this
is for you...how difficult...
just...give it a chance. It
won't be so bad.

She looks at him longingly.
10.

Continued. 2.

CAROL
I know.

He kisses her lightly on the lips...and starts to
leave.

CAROL
Bill.

O'Niel stops at the doorway. He looks at her.

O'NIEL
Yeah?

Carol stares at him.

CAROL
Bill...

She goes to him and kisses him fiercely on the mouth.

CAROL
I love you.

He holds her.

O'NIEL
I love you too.
(pause)
Just give it a chance. We've
only been here two weeks.
It'll get better. I promise.

She holds on to him...without answering.
O'NIEL
I've got to go. You smell
good.

He touches her cheek with his hand...and leaves. Carol
keeps staring at the doorway. Then she turns to Paul

cuT TO:

INT. MESS HALL MORNING 3.

It is a cafeteria...large and crowded. The workers
push their trays past the counter of steaming food.
There is no attempt to make the area look anything
except functional. The tables are long metal slabs.
dl.

Continued. , 3.

The chairs are matching grey. The lighting is from
florescent slabs...hanging from the geodesic ceiling.

We slowly drift through this loud room...past the
clusters of men telling dirty jokes at their tables...
past some of the women workers who are sitting
together...towards the back.

A man enters. He looks just like everybody else. He is
fairly large...with a nose that is flattened at the
bridge...obviously from being broken many years ago.

His dark eyes pan the mess hall...looking for someone.

At a table near the side...one of the workers puts down
his coffee mug. He gets up and walks to the back.
His eyes never look directly at the man who has just
entered. The worker opens a door and leaves the mess
hall. After a few seconds...the other man follows
through the same door.

cur TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM MORNING 4.

The locker room is a series of extremely narrow aisles,
cutting through endless rows of high grey metal
lockers. Workers are changing into their environment
suits...still carrying on loud raucous conversations.
They barely have enough room to put the bulky suits on,
in the confines of the cramped aisles.

The worker from the cafeteria pushes through an aisle
to his locker. He pushes the combination keys in the
proper sequences...and opens the locker door.

The other man is about ten seconds behind the worker.
We are a distance away...too far away to hear what is
being said. All we can really see is that the man
pauses at the worker's locker long enough to give him
something. There appears to be an exchange of some
kind...and words spoken. The man is on his way...
and the worker is starting to put on his environment
suit...in a matter of just a few seconds.

INT. ‘ADMINISTRATION WARD-ROOM DAY 5.

This room is about a quarter the size of the workers’
mess hall. ‘The tables have tablecloths. The lighting
12.

Continued. 5.

is recessed...creating a glow, rather than a glare.
There are waiters here. This is not a cafeteria.

About forty people are finishing their coffee. They
are all facing a table at the front of the room.
Seated at the table is a man in his early forties.
There is a canniness to his features. It is the kind
of intelligence lurking in his dark eyes that makes
him formidable, despite the fact that he is neither
large nor athletic looking. it is the kind of face
that is not used to waiting on lines. His name is
Sheppard.

Next to him is O'Niel, who is standing facing the
people. Seated next to O'Niel is Montone. O'Niel
has been speaking.

O'NIEL
Finally...I realize’ I'm new
here. You're going to have
to get to know me...and I'm
going to have to get to know
you. I just hope I can justify
your confidence.

{pause)

There is total silence in the room. You can hear the
coffee lapping against the rims of the cups.

O'NIEL
Thank you.

He slowly sits down. The quiet hangs in the air like
a fog.

O'NIEL
(whispering)
I really wowed them.

MONTONE
(whispering)
Had them eating out of your
hand.
SHEPPARD

{full voice)
Are there any questions?

A number of bottoms squirm in their chairs. Finally,
a middle aged woman raises her hand.

MRS. SPECTOR
Marshal?...Flo Spector...
13.

Continued. 5,

MRS. SPECTOR (cont'd)
Accounting services. I'm sure
I speak for all of us here...
in extending our welcome to you
and your family. If there is
anything Mrs. O'Niel or your son
should need...please tell them
to call me.

O'NIEL
Thank you very much, Mrs. Spector...
I will be sure and tell Mrs. O'Niel.

He looks around for more questions. There are none.
Everybody is plainly bored.

SHEPPARD
Well...I see there are no more
questions. I would just like
to add my welcome to Marshal
O'Niel. I'm sure you all agree
he will find this a pleasant
tour. I know he's just started
here, Pretty soon he will find
that this is just like every
other mining town, There is
never much trouble.

O'NIEL
I'm glad to hear it.

Montone shifts in his seat.

SHEPPARD
Just remember...these men and
women work hard. Very hard.
Since I have been General Manager
here, this mine has broken all
productivity records. We are
on our way to becoming the
leading Con-Amalgamate operation...
and everyone in this room has
received the bonus checks to
prove it. Good work only comes
from contented people. I work
them hard and I let them play
hard.

O'Niel looks at him.
5.

14.

Continued. 5.

SHEPPARD (cont'd)
So when the time comes for
them to let off a little
steam...you have to allow them
some room. As long as no harm's
done...just give them a little
room. Do you understand what
I'm saying Marshal?

O'Niel stares at him for an uncomfortable moment.

O'NIEL
Thank you for the advice,
Mr. Sheppard.

SHEPPARD
We're all professionals.

O'NIEL
I'm sure we are.

SHEPPARD
You drop around to my office.
We'll talk some more.

O'NIEL
T'll do that.

CUT TO:

INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR

O'Niel is striding angrily through one of the long
vacuum hose~like corridors. It sways with the weight
of his stride...and with the weight of Montone who is
struggling to keep a pace behind him.

MONTONE
Now don't go getting your
nose all out of joint.

O'Niel doesn't answer. He just keeps marching through
the translucent corridor.

O'NIEL
What the hell was that all about?

MONTONE
That's just his way. A little
ceremony for the good folk...
that's all.
15.

Continued. : 6.

O'NIEL
I don't like his way.

MONTONE
Don't mess with him.

O'NIEL
He's an asshole.

MONTONE
He's a very powerful asshole.
Don't mess with him.

They reach the end of the corridor...and open the
hatch to building 7.
: CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING #74 7 DAY 7.

This is the security area. It houses the jail, a
small squad room, a data center, an interrogation
room, and a small office with a glass wall that

overlooks the squad room. On the door is written:

“FEDERAL DISTRICT MARSHAL
W.T. O'NIEL"

O'Niel enters...still trailed by Montone.

MONTONE

He's just trying to sniff you
out. The last Marshal before
you kept things pretty smooth.
That's all they want. If things
run smooth...they make their
money...and nobody's here for
their health or for the scenery.

Some of the young police officers stand when O'Niel
enters. He marches past them without noticing. He
goes in his office and closes the door.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM DAY a.

A worker named Cane enters the locker room. He is a
blond man with a thin beard. His eyes are pale blue...

and they have an unusually serene expression on them.
His mouth is curved in a half smile. He iooks like

a little boy coming home with a note from the dentist
saying he has no cavities.

“Cane walks through the aisles of lockers. He is not

wearing an environment suit. He goes to the outer
hatch. It is the one marked:

"CAUTION...NO ATMOSPHERE
PRESSURE SUITS AND OXYGEN REQUIRED"

He looks through the porthole into the airlock. It is
empty. He opens the hatch an@ enters the lock. He
closes the hatch.

INT. AIRLOCK 9.
Cane methodically closes the hatch to the outside...
sealing the lock. He pushes the button for the mine
elevator.

INT. LOCKER ROOM 10.
A small group of workers have finished filling their
oxygen tanks...and start to leave for the elevator.

They get to the hatchway and see the red "occupied"
light on. They look through the porthole and see

Cane standing there...without an environment suit.

The men start to shout at him.

INT. AIRLOCK ll.

Cane is placidly waiting for the elevator.

INT. LOCKER ROOM 12.

The men pound frantically on the porthole.

INT. AIRLOCK 13.

Cane hears the muffled pounding. He slowly turns and
sees the terrified faces of the men through the port-
hole. He smiles and waves to them.

The buzzer sounds,..announcing the arrival of the
elevator. The door slides open. Cane steps in.

He smiles again at the faces through the porthole.
The elevator door slides closed. We can see Cane's
face through the window in the elevator door...
through the airlock porthole.

INT. LOCKER ROOM 14.
The men are agonized by their helplessness...as they

see Cane's blond blue~eyed face descend out of
sight...as the elevator starts up.

INT. EXT. FOURTH LEVEL MINE SHAFT 15.
A group of workers are waiting for the elevator to
arrive. They are impatient. This is the end of

their shift.

The counter light starts to read off the levels...
as the elevator travels down the shaft. The light

skips through “ATMOSPHERE"..."GROUND LEVEL"...
"DECOMPRESSION"..."NO ATMOSPHERE",,,"FIRST LEVEL...
"SUB ONE"..."SUB TWO"..."SUB THREE"..."SUB FOUR".

The elevator arrives. We can see the elevator
window...as the car slides to a stop. The window has
become smeared with a thick red.

The elevator door opens. We can only see the reaction
of the men who are standing in front...when they see
what is inside.

WEDNESDAY, 6:55 P.M. 16,
INT. O'NIEL'S QUARTERS EVENING

O'Niel walks in the door. He is tired. He looks
around. Everything is quiet.

There is silence.

He stands there for a moment. He goes to the bedrocm.
There is no one there, He comes back into the living
room area. He looks around again. he goes to the
television monitor and punches the computer code.

PROCEED
He types:
O'NIEL, W.T. MESSAGES?
The machine prints out:
O'NIEL, W.T. AFFIRMATIVE

O'Niel pushes the transmit button...and the television
monitor flickers on. The face on the screen is Carol's.
She is on the brink of tears.

CAROL
I...I'm trying to keep my
composure..and...and like
everything else I do...I
think I'm messing this up.

She takes a deep breath.

CAROL
I despise these message things.
I...I'm just such a coward...
I couldn't look at your face,
and say what I'm about to say...
I just couldn't. If you were
in front of me...I would change
my mind...and I don't want to
change my mind.

O'Niel feels behind him for a chair...and slowly sits
down...never taking his eyes off the screen.

CAROL

I love you. Please know that.

(pause)
I hadn't planned this. I
really hadn't. Look at me...
I'm asking for approval...
My analysis tapes say I.
constantly crave approval...
and look at me...

She blows her nose in a pale blue tissue.

CAROL (cont'd)

Oh God...I just can't take
it anymore...that's really
what it amounts to. We've
gone over this so many times
before. We've had the same
erying from me, and the same
assurances from you that the
next place will be different.
It never is different. It
can't be.

(pause)
So something snapped in me
yesterday. I couldn't bear
to watch Paulie clatter around
another bleak place, He has
no friends. Ever since he was
born, he has been trucked off
from one cesspool to the next...
a year or two at a time. He's
a child...and he's never set foot
on Earth. Never. He reads books
and looks at pictures of Earth all
day long...and then he hides them
from you so your feelings won't
be hurt. He's like his father.
He never complains. He's not like
his mother, God knows.

O'Niel's face is rim lit by the glow from the
television monitor. He folds his hands together, and
rests his chin on them.

CAROL

Don't you see...he deserves a
childhood. He deserves the
chance to breathe air...real
outside air...where you don't
broil...or explode..-air that
smells like life...not like a
ventilating unit.

(pause)
You think that it's all worth
it. You think that you go where
they send you...you keep the good
old peace...and do the good old
job. Well...I'm not as fortunate
as you. I don't have your abiding
faith. I can't see anything
except one God-forsaken mining

town that looks just like every
other one. The Company is the
same...the greedy people are the
same...the violence is the same.
I'm just not as good as you are.
I don't think it's all worth it.

O'Niel clenches his jaw...causing the small muscles
in his cheek to twitch.

CAROL
So...so I'm taking Paulie back

She looks straight at the camera...straight at us...
she tries to say something else...except she can't.
Her eyes are filled with tears. She swallows. She
vainly tries to smile...and can manage no more than
a pathetic little shrug.
The screen flickers to black. Writing appears:

THURSDAY, 8:30 A.M. - 17.
INT. SQUAD ROOM MORNING

Montone is conducting the morning roll call. O'Niel

is sitting off to the side...partially observing

what is going on...and partially somewhere else.

MONTONE
Okay...what do we have?

He looks at a clipboard of reports.

BALLARD
We've put a monitor on the

MONTONE
Keep the monitor on for two
weeks.

O'Niel is chewing on a pencil. He is not watching
what is going on.

MONTONE
Nelson, what about the
detonators?

NELSON
They were found.

MONTONE
Where?

NELSON

I don't know. The shift foreman
reported that they were found...
and said not to bother.

MONTONE
Nelson...we're talking about
nuclear detonators...vou don't
lose them and then find them.
You lose your comb, and then find
it...not detonators. I want to
know where they were found...and
who found them. You get my drift?

NELSON
Yes, Sergeant.

MONTONE
Good for you, Nelson.

He looks at the clipboard again,

What about the club?

belts.

MONTONE
He can have them.

Reading again.

MONTONE
Slater...what about ‘the incident
in the mine elevator?

SLATER
Nothing much to tell, Sarge...
some cupcake named Cane decided
he didn't need an environment
suit. They're still sponging
him off the elevator walls.

O'Niel's eyes dart over to Slater. This is the first
time he is paying attention...

SLATER
He was alone...nobody was near
enough to have thrown him in.
A bunch of guys tried to get
into the airlock, except he
had sealed it. No way it could
have been homocide. Had to have
been suicide.

O'NIEL
Did he leave a note?

Everyone in the room is startled by the sudden presence
of O'Niel's voice. There is an evenness to his voice...
as well as a quietness to it.,.that makes you realise
that’ this man very rarely has to shout.

SLATER
I beg your pardon, sir?

O'NIEL
Did he leave a note?

SLATER
Uh...none that we found, sir.

O'NIEL

suicide?
SLATER

Uh...it...there’s...no other
explanation. He knew what he

was doing...that's for sure...
you can't fall into an airlock
and then an elevator...you have
to open hatches...press buttons...
close hatches...it's...just the
only explanation. .

O'Niel studies him for a long silent moment.

O'NZEL
Thank you.

SLATER
{very quietly)
Yes, sir.

MONTONE
Okay...FPanning...what do you
have on the pump station?

FANNING
Just a fight. We took'em both

straightened out in about an hour.

MONTONE

Pretty quiet. A couple of calls
about noise...nothing much.

INT. MALE WORKER QUARTERS AFTERNOON 18.

The men sleep in four-tiered bunks. Each bunk has

built-in drawer space. There are communal banks of
television monitors at each end of each aisle. One
of the monitors is entertainment...another is time

and internal/external temperatures...and the third

is the daily schedule.

This is a very crowded area, with some men sleeping...
others reading...men changing their clothes...and
groups of men going to and from the shower and bathrooms.

The effect is like a cramped pullman car. It is
impossible to navigate your way down a row, without
Squeezing past people.

The man we saw entering the cafeteria a while earlier...
enters the quarters. He stops at the beginning of an
aisle. Some men are watching a television monitor.

The man walks down the long aisle.

A worker on the fourth tier of bunks swings his legs
over the side...and starts to climb down the bunk
ladder. He reaches the ground just a few seconds after
the man passes beneath his bunk.

The two men...about twenty feet apart...walk the length
of the aisle...to the bathroom. .

INT. BATHROOM DAY 19,

The man walks past the steam filled shower room. There
are loud voices of men echoing off the tiles. The man
enters a toilet stall. He closes the door.

The worker walks through the same area. He enters the
adjoining toilet stall...and closes the door. In just
a few seconds...the man opens the door to his stall,
and leaves. Fives seconds later...the worker leaves.

cur TO:

INT. HOSPITAL DAY 20.

It is more like the sickbay of a military ship. Every-
thing is cluttered. It serves the entire mine as the
dispensary, infirmary, emergency room, and diagnostic
center. There are eight in staff...consisting of four
nurses, three paramedics, and Doctor Marian L. Lazarus.

Lazarus is an alert looking woman with the features of
amature adult, forming the perpetual expression of a
twelve year old. Her grey eyes emit a wry fatigue.

She is a rumpled, rather sloppy woman, who just doesn't
get too excited about things any more.

Lazarus is at an area towards the back. Even though
the hospital is an impressive array of built-in
eguipment, Lazarus’ area is an island of clutter in
this sea of efficiency.

O'Niel walks in the hospital...past the admitting
nurse. He strides towards Lazarus, who is hunched
over a stack of paperwork and a computer read out
screen,

LAZARUS
(yelling)
Who the hell ordered all these
pressure packs...this is a mine...
not a war.

NURSE
You did, Doctor.

LAZARUS
I said one hundred...not one
thousand.

NURSE
You said one thou....

LAZARUS
I said one hundred...which can't
be mistaken for anything except
one hundred. It doesn't sound
remotely like one thousand.
Listen...you'll see what I mean...

She sees O'Niel standing in front of her.

LAZARUS
You think they sound the same?
Who are you anyway?

O'NIEL
Are you Doctor Lazarus?

LAZARUS
Yes. Take two aspirin and
call me in the morning. That's
a medical joke. Are you the
new marshal?

O'NIEL
Yes. I'd like to talk to you
for a few minutes.

LAZARUS
I got an alibi. I got four
people who will swear™they
were playing poker with me.

She gets up...and starts trudging through the laboratory.
O'Niel starts to follow her.

O'NIEL
I've never heard that one
before...that's really funny.

LAZARUS
Sorry.

O'NIEL
Yesterday a man deliberately
went into the atmosphere without
a pressure suit.

LAZARUS
Yes.

Lazarus is taking an inventory as they walk. O'Niel
doesn't like to be trailing after her.

O'NIEL
A couple of days before that,
another man cut open his suit...
on purpose.

LAZARUS
it happens here.
O'NIEL
How often?
LAZARUS
I don't know. It just happens
here.
O'NIEL
Why?
LAZARUS

I'm not a4 psychiatrist. TI

there isn't a lot to inspect.

In the third place, you're
becoming a nuisance.

O'Niel shoves a drawer open...blocking her path.

O'NIEL

I know.

(pause) .
I would like a record of all
incidents like these last two,
that have happened during the
past six months. I would like
it real soon, or I just might
kick your nasty ass all over

O'Niel turns and walks away.

INT. MALE WORKERS' BARRACKS NIGHT

A worker we have seen before is getting dressed for a
night out. He is the one we saw in the locker room
making an exchange of some kind with that man. The
worker's name is Sagan. He has finished xunning an
electric razor over his face. He splashes on some
aftershave lotion and admires his face in the bath-
room mirror. He leaves the bathroom. He is wearing
only a pair of underpants.

INT. BUNK AREA NIGHT . 22.

Sagan walks down an aisle to his bunk and climbs to
the second level. He gets in his bunk. We can only
partially see what he is doing, as his reading light

Sagan reaches in one of his drawers, under some
clothing. He pulls out a small vaccination gun. He
then removes the drawer. He reaches inside the empty
space behind the drawer and pulls out a tiny vial.

He places the vial inside the vaccination gun. Then,
he presses the gun against his inner thigh. There is
a soft thumping sound as the gun delivers its charge.

Sagan sits back and inhales deeply. He closes his eyes.
After a pause...he quickly places the vaccination gun
back in the drawer and slides the drawer into its place.

Sagan pulls out a shirt and, whistling, starts to get
dressed for the evening.

INT. O'NIEL'S QUARTERS NIGHT 23.

O'Niel is sitting on the built-in couch...with his
feet resting on the small formica coffee table. He
looks distracted and tired.

There is a knock on the door.

O'NIEL
It's open.

Montone enters carrying a large tray filled with
covered plates. He puts the tray down on the coffee
table.

MONTONE
I don't know what you like
to eat...so I brought
everything.

O'Niel looks at the food, and tries to smile a
grateful smile at Montone.

MONTONE

something,

Montone walks to the kitchenette to get a plate and
a glass.

dessert...except you can't
have it until you finish all
your meat.

O'Niel smiles. The two of them sit there in silence.

MONTONE
I know how you feel.
(pause)
I do.

He leans forward.

MONTONE
The second time I did a tour, I
came back and my wife had skipped
off with some guy who's a computer
programmer.

O'Niel studies Montone.

MONTONE

I have two daughters. They
called the programmer 'Daddy'.
My wife said she was happy.
I said ‘happy?' The guy looks
so boring! She said he may not
be Mr. Excitement...except he
was home all the time.

(pause)
Can't argue with that.

Iwill.

MONTONE

lonely...they can help.

MONTONE
I get the feeling I'm bombing.

O'NIEL
No...I really appreciate what
you're doing. I really do.
It's just...it's just that I
would like to be alone right
now.

Montone gets up.

MONTONE
I understand, Marshal.

He goes to the door.

MONTONE
Tf you need anything...if you
just want to talk...please
call me.

O'NIEL
Thank you. IJ mean it.

MONTONE
Screw it. You can have the
chocolate cake.

He closes the door.

O'Niel smiles. Then the smile fades. He looks at the
food. He doesn't want to touch it.

Almost mechanically, he gets up and walks to the
television monitors. He switches one on and punches
the computer keyboard:

An image flickers on the monitor. JIt is Montone.

MONTONE
Marshal...we got a response
on your request.

O'Niel pushes the 'fast forward' button on the tape
machine. The picture turns to hash...and the sound
races to a high pitched gibberish. The squeaking
stops and there is a tone. O'Niel pushes the 'play'
button.

Another image appears.

O'Niel pushes thé 'fast forward' button again. He
waits until he hears the next set of tones and pushes
the 'play' button.

Carol's face appears.

composure...and...and like
everything else I do...I

O'Niel sits down again as he listens to a replay of
Carol's message.

INT, COMPARTMENT 27.

The room consists of a bed and a television monitor,
On the monitor is a pornographic film, Lying on his
back on the bed is Sagan. He is stripped to the
waist. His body is soaked with perspiration. Little
droplets of sweatare beading over his lips. His

eyes are wild with excitement. His face is contorted
in a manic smile.

One of his arms is around the bare chest of a young
brunette prostitute. His other arm holds a long thin
knife. The blade is gleaming in the light. The point
of the knife is at the girl's throat...puckering the
skin...and forcing her to strain her neck backwards

at a tortured angle.

The prostitute is bleeding from a broken nose. Her
lower lip is split...and her jaw is beginning to
discolor from a terrible blow...obviously done with a
closed fist. She is whimpering with terror...and
almost unconscious form being beaten so badly.

SAGAN
Get away from me! I'll kill
her...I swear to God I will.
I'll slit her throat.

O'NIEL (v.o.)
Why? What has she done?

SAGAN
She's evil, I want you to go
away...now! I will slice her
little pink throat right this
minute if you don't go away!

He applies a little more pressure on the knife blade.
It barely pierces the skin, A tiny red dot appears
on her flesh...and a trickle of blood rolls down the
side of her neck.

four bolts on a panel high on the wall. She pulls the
panel out...revealing a narrow passageway.

Montone looks at O'Niel and nods. He and two deputies
climb in the ducts...taking their weapons with them.

O'Niel then walks back to the door. He motions to the

valve. She slides the panel open and poises her gloved
hand on the pressure lever.

bank of body drawers on one end. The covers are all
made of lucite so you can see the bodies in the drawers.

A frown comes over his face.

He looks at the examining tables in the middle of the
room. They are empty.

LAZARUS
Twenty eight...in six months.

O'NIEL
E wonder how many in the six
months before that.

LAZARUS
Twenty four. I've got initiative.

O'NIEL
Good for you.

O'Niel starts pulling open the body drawers. They are
empty.

LAZARUS
You want to know how many
during the six months before
that?

O'Niel looks up at her.

LAZARUS

O'NIEL
You notice anything?

LAZARUS
I'm unpleasant...I'm not
stupid...of course I notice
something.

O'NIEL
What do you think?

LAZARUS
I don't know. Almost everybody

Why people suddenly start to
lose their marbles in greater
numbers is not so mystifying.
I don't know why more of them
didn't do it sooner.

O'Niel pulls out the last drawer. Tt is empty.
Sagan's body is not in the morgue.

O'NIEL
Where do they send the bodies?

LAZARUS
They usually put them on the
next shuttle. They wrap them
up and jettison the body half
way to the station. Burial at
sea and all that crap.

EXT. FREIGHT DOCK NIGHT. 50.

The freight dock is a cavernous area.,.stretching over
one hundred yards. It looks like a giant hangar...
except it is more organized. A series of rail spurs

meet at one end, for hopper cars and other conveyer
vehicles to unload their ore. All of the freight is
segregated into type and then loaded into huge containers.
The containers are put into the freight bay of the
shuttle and then shipped out.

At night, the freight dock is deserted. Harsh bare
lamps burn at the bottoms of long poles hanging from
the ceiling.

They cast individual funnels of light. The rest of
the hangar is black.

A tiny spot appears at the end of the freight dock.

It moves into a pool of light and then into shadow.
When it reappears into another funnel of light, we can
see it is O'Niel...alone...dwarfed by the containers
he is passing by.

O'Niel is checking the bills of lading on the containers.
All of them are covered with a bright company logo.
Underneath the logo is the category of the container.
Most of them are unrefined ore,

Towards the back of the building, there are two
containers with different markings. O'Niel inspects
them. His shadow dances across the shiny white sides
of the containers...past the company logo...past the
word “Fragile". The second container has a different
marking. It states: "To Be Jettisoned".

O'Niel looks around him. The area is so vast, and so
quiet, his breathing sounds thunderous. Very carefully,
he opens the four latches at one end of the container.
They each make a loud metallic click. O'Niel pulls

the huge side lid open and shines his flashlight

inside.

The round beam skips across a pile of metal boxes.

All of them have a three triangle sign indicating they
are radio-active waste. On the lower left hand side,
there is a silver mylar body bag.

O'Niel stoops down and inspects the bag. He slowly
pulls the zipper. First, we can see strands of hair...
then the forehead...then two eyes, wide open with
terror and surprise. Tinally, Sagan's entire face

is gaping upward.

O'Niel ptils the zipper halfway down the body, reveal-
ing the red stained gauze that was placed over the

hole in his chest. O'Niel reaches in his breast pocket
and removes a syringe.

There is a pause...to take a couple of deep breaths,
then he methodically plunges the syringe into an
artery at the base of Sagan's neck. The clear plastic
container behind the needle slowly fills with a thick,
blue-red liquid.

are in the hospital. She is sleeping on an examining

table.

LAZARUS

O'NIEL (v.o.)

Yes.
LAZARUS

Lazarus is emptying the syringe into four tubes. She
is placing the tubes in an elaborate chemical analyzer.
The results appear on four monitors. The lighted keys
on the computer board and the television monitors are
the sole illumination in the lab.

O'Niel is seated next to her.

O'NIEL
How long will this take?

LAZARUS
You're kidding me.

Some data appears on one of the screens.

forming a geometric pattern.

O'Niel cranes forward...looking at the monitor.

O'NIEL

No. Impossible. It has to

O'NIEL

No autopsies...so nobody knows
anything. The workers are
producing more, so the mine is
more productive. By the time
their heads get scrambled,
their tour is up. The Company
is making a bigger profit...
so they're not about to ask
any questions. That's not a
bad set up.

O'Niel gets up and goes to the door.
O'NIEL

Listen...don't say anything

INT. LEISURE CLUB NIGHT

A naked woman flashes brilliant white and then black in
a blazing strobe light. She is gyrating wildly to a
thunderous percussive bass music. Her head is tilted
back. Her teeth are bared under her lips in an erotic
sneer. Her hair is matted with perspiration and sticks
to the nape of her neck.

She is dancing in a lucite cylinder...suspended over a
tremendous bar. Next to her is another cylinder. A
naked man is dancing in that one. His muscular body is
soaked in perspiration...and tiny droplets spray off
his arms as he flails away to the music.

The bar is crowded with men and women...who have to
shout just to be heard over the music. The club re-
flects all of the attitudes of Ganymede. The work is
grim and harsh here. The workers tend to take their
pleasure with a vengeance.

There are tables in the club. Each has a deep amber
lamp. There are amber lights around the bar. That is

Spota walks in the club. He looks around...scanning
the crowd. Then he walks over to the bar. He smiles
a greeting to one of the bartenders...and orders a
drink.

Near the ceiling of the club...hidden from sight in
the exposed piping and wiring...is a small television
camera. It is slowly panning back and forth.

corridor. On another...we see a picture of the cafeteria.
On a third...we see the club. The image is sweeping

from left to right...scanning the club. When the camera
reaches the bar...O'Niel leans forward. He pushes a

an undercut return.

the ball out of reach...and wins the point.

Montone serves a ball that bounces high off the front
wall. O'Niel pushes off the ground to intercept the
shot. Montone pushes off the side wall...diagonally
to the left to get O'Niel's shot.

The point continues with both men leaping up and
sideways...pushing off the floor, and in one instance,
pushing off the wall. O'Niel finally wins the point.

He is breathless...and takes a few seconds to gain his
wind back. Montone is not in much better shape.

O'Niel serves the ball hard to the right. Montone blocks
the serve...and cuts the ball height again. O'Niel

O'Niel enters the locker room. He is by the oxygen
loading area. He looks around.

Spota is making his way down a locker aisle.

O'Niel is at the far end of the locker area. He is
erossing behind all the aisles...trying to look down
the long rows to catch a glimpse of Spota. It is hard
because they are so congested.

Spota turns a corner...and starts down another aisle.

O'Niel sees Spota...just as he disappears behind some

lockers. He weaves his way through a slalom course
of people...bumping into some along the way.

A worker is opening his locker. He is looking down the
aisle...as if he is expecting someone. He sees Spota.
There is a flicker of recognition,

O'Niel is half the aisle behind Spota...gaining on him.
every step. He sees the man standing by his locker.

He can sense that this man by the locker is going to
buy from Spota.

Spota is one step from the man when O'Niel knocks into
a worker standing in the middle of the aisle. The
noise causes Spota and the other man to turn around.
They see O'Niel.

Spota lunges forward...throwing the man behind him.
O'Niel is after him in two strides. Spota is tearing
through the aisle like a wild man...not caring who or
what he hits in the process. O'Niel is trying to catch
him, and trying not to maim anybody else in the process.

The commotion is loud and violent. The shouting and
confusion echoes off the locker room walls. Spota
leaps on the benches between the lockers. He grabs
onto a locker door...and pulls himself up on top of
the lockers. He starts leaping across the room...from
one row of lockers to another,

O'Niel pulls himself up on top of the lockers with a
grunt. He can see Spota almost half way across the
huge room. He takes off after him. He leaps from
aisle to aisle. He is not as young as Spota. He
trips, and almost splits his face on the corner of
the lockers. He regains his footing and jumps across
to the next aisle.

cur TO:

INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR 108.

Spota tears into the corridor. His eyes are wild with
a émixture of fear and rage. He is almost at the end
of the corridor when O'Niel enters. He makes it to
the hatchway...and claws it open.

O'Niel is breathing hard...his mouth open...sweat gather-
ing at his neck. He is racing down the corridor...
causing it to billow and sway more than normal. The
white billowy ribs flash by him as he runs.

O'Niel enters the cafeteria. Spota's collisions have
slowed him down. O'Niel is gasping for breath. He
stumbles on after him.

Spota hurls himself into the crowd on line for food.
He lashes his elbow viciously sideways. Blood pours
from the mouth of a man who has fallen to the ground.

O'Niel is getting closer,

Spota vaults over the food service counter. Everyone
is trying to get out of his way. It is all happening
too fast to register. A cafeteria worker goes down
behind the counter...having been thrown by Spota.

O'Niel jumps over the food service counter. He avoids
the person lying on the ground.

Spota has nowhere to go except through the double
Metal swinging doors into the kitchen.

cur TO:

INT. KITCHEN 112.

Spota barrels into the kitchen...past the rows of
Inicrowave ovens...and the long steam tables.

O'Niel is close behind.

Spota realizes that he has closed himself off. There
is no exit at the end of the kitchen. He wheels
around and sees O'Niel almost on him. He reaches
inside his shirt and rips off a vial of red liquid
that has been taped to his chest. He throws the vial
into a metal vat of boiling water.

O'Niel doesn't hesitate. He lunges forward and
thrusts his hand in the boiling water. He lets out a
groan of pain...as he removes the vial. The plastic
has not yet melted.

Spota grabs a long butcher knife and brings it down
at O'Niel's arm. O'Niel rolls out of the way...

and the blade slams into the counter. He takes his
shotgun by the barrel, and swings the butt at
Spota...who has raised the knife again. The shotgun
stock catches Spota's shoulder. The knife blade is
@eflected, just after it pierces O'Niel's forearm.
Blood begins to seep through his shirt.

O'Niel is grappling with a man who is insane with
fury. He is unable to contain Spota...who is lashing
out with his legs and the knife.

O'Niel knees Spota in the groin. Spota is momentarily
doubled up. OQ'Niel rolls to the side. He turns the
shotgun around. Spota lurches towards him...raising
the knife again.

O'Niel fires four rounds from the shotgun. The roar
in the metal kitchen is deafening. The pellets crash
in a circle around Spota...ripping through the metal
dividers...shattering lights...and filling the room
with acrid smoke.

It is all over in two seconds. The four blasts have
hit in a circle around Spota. None have hit him.
Spota is frozen, by the ferocity of what has just
happened, and by the speed with which it was done.
He looks at O'Niel...who has the shotgun leveled
directly at his head.

O'Niel is still on the floor...panting...holding the
shotgun with one hand...his other hand is bleeding.

O'NIEL
Think it over.

INT. JAIL 113

O'Niel is walking down a long corridor. Montone is
one step behind him. O'Niel's hand is bandaged.

One side of the corridor is a series of enormous
glass rectangular windows. Over each one is written:
"NO ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY"

Through the windows we can see men in atmosphere
suits...floating at the end of long tethers. Each
window in effect looks into an individual jail cell.
Each prisoner floats in a cell...getting oxygen
through the tether. They do not have individual back
air tanks.

O'NIEL

If anyone doés...I want to

They arrive at window number 37. A man is floating

at the end of a long red tether. There is a telephone
receiver for the intercom. It is over the control
valves for the oxygen supply. There is a small hatch
that leads into the cell. Stenciled on the door in
red block letters is:

"CAUTION, NO ATMOSPHERE, OXYGEN REQUIRED"

O'Niel picks up the receiver.

O'NIEL
Spota...this is O'Niel.

He can hear breathing and the steady rush of air...
from inside of Spota's helmet.

O'NIEL
The lab report says you were
carrying four ounces of
Polydychlioric Euthimal...
which is four hundred doses.

SPOTA

Sheppard is in the middle of the room...putting a

O'Niel walks in. ‘Sheppard doesn't look up. He
strokes the ball.

O'Niel walks down the corridor. The corridor is
almost totally dark. Only small pin lights illuminate
the telephone receivers at each cell. The cells
themselves are brightly lit. The effect is like
walking down an aquarium.

Because it is late at night...many of the prisoners
are sleeping. As a result...some of them are

There is no answer. Spota remains turned away from
the picture window, O'Niel's face is lit by the glow
of the cells pouring into the corridor.

O'NIEL
Hey.

O'Niel looks into the cell more closely. He sees that
the oxygen tether leading to Spota's atmosphere suit
has been severed. The end of the section leading from
the air supply is floating free. The end of the

There is no response. He sees that Montone's bunk
has not beenslept in. He knocks on the bathroom door.

O'NIEL

There is only silence,

O'Niel starts to search the room, He opens some of
Montone‘s desk and dresser drawers, He pulls open

O'Niel takes a deep breath...and then begins to move

the wixe from the closet...and he sets Montone on the
ground. He looks at how distorted Montone's face is.

He rips a sheet off of the bunk...and covers the body.

A small green message light is winking on and off...

as O'Niel enters his quarters. There is a weariness

INT. SHUTTLE LOADING DOCK NIGHT 118.

O'Niel's flashlight casts a thin white shaft in the
dark. jungle of equipment and containers. He can hear
himself breathe in the quiet, Places that are normally
noisy take on a nervous quiet when they are unoccupied.

We see O'Niel from a distance...as he inspects the
markings on the various containers. The flashlight

skims over the ribbed surface of a refrigerated contain-
er. It is marked with the company logo...and the words:
"REFRIGERATED/PERISHABLES".

cur TO:

INT. CONTAINER 119.

O'Niel strafes the inside of the huge container with
his flashlight. His warm breath forms puffs of smoke
in the freezing air. His collar is pulled up and
buttoned at the top.

Sides .of beef hang from large hooks...the meat a shiny
red under the pale layer of fat. The rigid line of
beef sides runs the entire length of the container.

O'Niel begins to walk down the line of carcasses. The
light dances off the protruding ribs...and the blue
stamp marks on the fat layer.

A garrotte wire slams over o'Niels head before he knows
what has happened. His hands instinctively go up to
his throat...trying to claw for breath.

Yario's massive arms are gripping the wire tighter and
tighter. His knee is in O'Niel's back...forcing him
to arch backwards. Yario's knee lifts O'Niel off the
ground.

O'Niel's eyes are bulging with fear and pain. He is
making rasping noises...while he tries to writhe away
from Yario's grip. He flails his arms and legs....
desperately trying to strike Yario.

Slowly,..0'Niel's motions become weaker. The veins in
his neck are bulging. His arms stop swinging. His
legs cease kicking. His chest stops moving. He crumples.

Yario drops O'Nielsts body on the floor of the container,
He walks down to the end of the container. The various
sides of beef are marke@ for their destinations, Some
are marked: "CAPETERIA"...others are marked: "WARD ROOM

MESS", There is one side of beef that is stamped:
"GENERAL MANAGER". Yario goes over to it...and
starts to turn it around.

O'Niel's leap brings him slamming into Yario's rib
cage...crashing him against the container wall. The
force of the impact momentarily knocks the wind out
of Yario. O'Niel puts bota hands together...and
drives them into the bridge of Yario's nose. Blood
begins spurting as soon as the bone has been broken.

Yario rises like a wounded bear. O'Niel drives his
head into Yario's solar plexus. The air goes out
of his huge body with an enormous whoosh. Yario
doubles over. O'Niel puts all of his weight into
swinging his knee up into Yario's descending chin.
The impact is a dreadful deep thud. Yario is a
quiet mound of unconscious muscle and bones on the
floor.

O'Niel leans against the wall for support...as he
tries to catch his breath. He reaches up with his
left arm...and unbuttons his collar. We see that he
has been wearing a rigid protective collar of
plastic. He takes the collar off...and throws it on
the ground.

O'Niel looks over at the side of beef with "GENERAL
MANAGER" stamped on it. He walks to it. He starts
turning it around slowly. He shines his flashlight
inside the hollow...inspecting the grey ribs.
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

He reaches in his pocket and takes out a small knife.
He makes a thin slice in the fat layer. He pokes his
finger in. We see his face. We can read by his
expression that he has felt something.

He quickly slices away the fat layer on one side. He
reaches in and peels the layer back from the meat.
There is no meat underneath. There are more than one
hundred of the soft plastic bags of red liquid that
Spota was carrying. A smile starts to curl on
O'Niel's lip.

The image floats down the fairway in the trajectory

the real ball would have traveled. It comes to land
about two hundred and forty yards from the tee...in the
right rough.

Sheppard is still in his follow through...staring at
the results in the screen. He is standing on an astro-
turf mat...at one end of this elaborate machine. The
office is dark. Sheppard is lit by the glow of the
projected image on the screen.

O'NIEL (o.s.)
What's the matter...sun get

Sheppard turns around and sees O'Niel standing in the
doorway.

SHEPPARD
Well, well...if it isn't

Sheppard turns back to concerntrate on his second shot.
O'Niel walks in the room.

O'NIEL
Hey, Sheppard...guess what I
just found in a meat locker?

SHEPPARD
I have this feeling you're

I don't guess.

Sheppard takes out an iron from his golf bag.

O'NIEL

I found 250 pounds of hamburger
named Yario that works for you.
I also found your shipment of

Yes.

SHEPPARD
You do have a flair for the

Each island contains the wiring and fuses for the

comes to the island marked: "GENERAL MANAGER",

There are rows of metal panels...each housing a bus

boisterous.

O'Niel enters the club and looks around. He starts
toward the bar. As he does...he is noticed by the
crowd. They become noticeably silent. They watch
him...as if he is doing something fascinating.

O'Niel walks as if nothing out of the ordinary is going
on. He reaches the bar. A small knot of men part...
making a clear path for him. He leans over and orders
a drink. The bartender studies him for a moment...and
then pours a glass of beer for him.

The hollow echo of the ball accentuates his isolation.
He hits it against the wall...and then goes after it
for a return. He misses the shot.

O'Niel stands there...letting the ball roll to the end
of the court. He doesn't even make an attempt to
retrieve it.

LAZARUS
That's pretty good. Playing
by yourself, and losing.

Lazarus strolls in. O'Niel doesn't look around.

LAZARUS
I'd join you in this dumb

Lazarus sits down on the polished wooden floor.
O'Niel goes over and picks up the ball.

LAZARUS

Eight years. We were really

for the next two...and genuinely
miserable for the last two.

I remember when we decided to
get a divorce. It was a
Saturday. The weather was
beautiful...we went to a party...
really interesting people were

looked at him...and we both
knew it was over. Civilized...

He said, 'You know...I will
always love you. I want you
to always be happy. I hope
you find someone else.'
(pause)
Class. That guy had what
it takes...let me tell you.
(pause)
When you really care for
somebody...you want them to
be happy.
(pause)
I looked at him and I said,
'I hope you're miserable...
and I hope your nose falls
right off your face.' Then
I got drunk.
(pause)
You see...if I really had
what it takes...I would have
said the right thing. If T
really had what it takes...
I never would have wound up
in this God-forsaken place.

You're looking for sterling
character?...you're in the

something like that.

You think you're making a

O'Niel shrugs.

LAZARUS
Then why, for God's sake?

O'NIEL

Because maybe they're right.
They send me here to this
pile of shit...because
they think I belong here.
I've got to find out if
they're right.

(pause)
There's a whole machine that
works because everybody does
what they're supposed to.
I found out I'm supposed to
be something I don't like.
That's what's in the program.
That's my rotten little part
in the rotten machine.

I don't like it. I'm going
to find out if they're right.

only exaggerated by the quiet of his small apartment.
You can hear the fabric squeak as O'Niel sits down.
You can hear the sound of him exhaling.

The quiet is suddenly pierced by the shrill beeping of
the telephone...which is accompanied by a flashing red
light over the monitor. The sudden presence of a
sound is startling.

O'Niel gets up and turns the monitor on. The screen
is flashing in large letters:

television camera that is pointed at him. He then

Do you think you're making a

O'Niel tries to answer. All he can do is shake his
head.

You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

Yes. .

There is a pause. Neither of them know what to say.

Something is wrong there, isn't

seeing if the barrels are clean. He inspects the

Nothing moves. It is as if the area is recovering

Finally they are alone. They place their nylon bags

on the floor and open them. Each bag contains a weapon
in sections. Each man removes the pieces. Barrels

are snapped into stocks. Clips are slapped into place.
Strange looking sights are slid into holders.

The two men get up. Each one enters an access corridor
leading off into three directions. Not a word is
exchanged between them.

all around O'Niel. He dives for cover, Tables around
him are showered with sparks...and orange streaks from
the tracers come from overhead. O'Niel can make out
the figure of Man #4 1 silhouetted against the slits

of light from the gridwork on the ceiling. Man #74 1

is on the level above the ceiling looking down at him.
He is firing through a lighting port.

One of the hatchways from an access corridor leading
to the access junction begins to turn. There is
someone on the other side about to enter.

is rising from the refueling hoses,

O'Niel is still slumped with his back to the elevator...
on the catwalk above the edge of the Greenhouse. He
feels his shoulder and winces. He slowly starts to get
up, and turns around.

The tracer bullets roar towards him. They strike the
enormous solar collectors, each almost one ‘hundred feet
square, that stretch over the power plant. There is a
blinding shower of blue sparks, and the bullets strike
the panels. Electric arcs snap up and down.

O'Niel flattens himself on che catwalk, He can see the
stxobe light flashing in the background. He knows some-
one has used the elevator.

Ballard makes his way towards O'Niel. He is on one

Continued 245.

Ballard has reached the catwalk at the other end of the

collector panels...and starts to climb on the ridge of
one of the panels.

O'Niel stays on the tiny catwalk...twenty feet over the
top of the paneis,..and crawls along,

Below...the four titanic panels shimmer with electrical
energy. Blue lines of arc light ripple upwards across
them. Hundreds of feet below...the transformers are
buzzing menacingly.

Ballard is stalking along the top of one collector
panel, O'Niel is crawling along the catwalk above him.
Both the catwalk and the top of the panel are only
about four feet wide.

O'Niel waits until Ballard is almost directly below
him. He swings over the catwalk railing, and drops
straight down,..kicking violently...and striking the
side of Ballard's helmet.

The impact sends Ballard reeling forwards. The gun

goes flying out of his hands. The impact also sends
O'Niel floating backwards...over the side of the collector
panel.

The gun floats down and scrapes along the side of the
panel, There is an explosion of sparks by the mere
contact of the chargedfield. The light display of
sparks continues as the gun strikes the bottom panei.
It falls hundredsof feet down.

O'Niel desperately grabs the ridge along the top of the
panel...and tries to prevent his leg from touching the
side. Ballard has stumbled to his feet. He turns

to see O'Niel's desperate struggle to gain a footing

on the top ridge...without touching the panel.

O'Niel sees that it is Ballard. There is a moment of
recognition between them.

Ballard lunges for O'Niel. O'Niel grabs on to his leg.
Ballard is trying to kick O'Niel off...sending him
against the enormous voltage of the blue arc laden panels.

The two men struggle ferociously...balanced precariously
on the thin ridge. The entire expanse of the power
station and the mine platform sprawl down below.

Ballard lashes out with the intensity of a rabid animal,
O'Niel holds on for dear life. He pulls on the man's
ankle. The ridge of the panel is too thin. Ballard
loses his balance.

Both men tumble over the side...and float past the
sparking panel. Their struggle is lit by the fuming
mass of orange in the sky. They claw at the air...
trying to find something to grab on to, and trying to
avoid contact with the panel.

O'Niel manages to grab onto the struts under the first
row of collector panels, and above the second row. [It
stops his fall. Ballard grabs the same strut.

They both grapple and climb onto the narrow strut.
Their images flicker in the blue sparks, and are rim~
lit by the orange from Jupiter in the black sky.

The wound in O'Niel's shoulder is beginning to take

its toll. He can't hold on with both arms. Ballard
leaps at O'Niel...,and starts to pry his one hand

from the strut. O'Niel doesn't have the strength

to keep holding on, He takes his free hand and reaches
around for the valve leading from Ballard's air tank.

Ballard has almost succeeded in prying O'Niel's hand
from the strut...when O'Niel closes the valve, Ballard
draws a breath, and starts to choke. He involuntarily
lets go of O'Niel...to reach for his air valve.

O'Niel makes one last kick with both legs at the chest
of Ballard, both of whose hands are on his back. It
is enough to send him down and sideways, Ballard's
right boot strikes the surface of the collector panel.

There is a blue-white eruption of sparks, Ballard's

body goes rigid with the jolt. He strikes the panel

again. Another shower of terrible light. He tumbles
slowly downward...skipping off the panel...shimmering
with the electricity that is surging through him,

He falls free...hundreds of feet downward. He is not
moving. His stiff body almost disappears in the -
distance...when it lands on the transformers, The buz~
zing of the electricity as it devours him is a harsh
flare, on the distant bottom of the platform.

O'Niel drapes his arms over the strut. He tries to
catch his breath...looking down at the transformers.
He leans his head against the strut...and closes his
eyes.
