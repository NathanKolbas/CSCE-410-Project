past four monolithic skyscrapers that rise above this
crumbling industrial city, down into:

THE DARK STREETS OF OLD DETROIT -- A TURBOCRUISER

througn the bad part of town at 3 a.m. Now the back-up
car appears, two biocks behind the lead car. Spotlights

INT BACK-UP TURBOCRUISER -—- UNIT 217

Two cops, FREDERICKSON and CONNORS, monitor an
impressive array of electronics. Readouts pump cop
information. These guys are dressed for heavy urban
crime: Padded body suits, high-impact plastic chest
armor, Sleek helmets. Up ahead, the lead car’s brake
lights flare.

Frederickson and Connors are skeptical now.
ALCOTT (ComLink)
Oh my God! Frederickson, it’s...

It’s your wife!

Alcott and Duffy's laughter comes over the ComLink.
Connors giggles and Frederickson rolls his eyes. The
laughter stops abrubtly in a shout of terrible surprise
and a rush of static.

Frederickson and Connors are frightened by what they

car. Connors moves to the middle of the street, turning
in slow circles, checking doorways and windows and
rooftops with the bayonet-mounted flashlight on his riot
gun.

reflects in Frederickson’s visor as he leans down close
to Duffy. It‘s clear now that Duffy is a woman.

CONNORS
Duffy?

FREDERICKSON
Dead.

Frederickson moves quickly to
ALCOTT

He's still alive but in convulsive shock, shot through
the chest. He's not going to make it.

moves in tighter circles, faster, getting nervous.
CONNORS
Come on, man. Let’s get the hell

out of here.

Ka- CHUNK! Connors pivots, leveling his riot gun. A
five shotgun barrage cuts him down.

comes up shooting. Muzzle flashes illuminate dark
shapes that close in on hia. He’s hit in the leg but he
stumbles to the TurboCruiser and drags himself inside.

High energy news music over slick montage of modern
Detroit featuring the cheerful faces of co-anchors JESS
PERKINS and CASEY WONG. The hyper, up-beat NARRATOR
says, “This is MediaBreak. You give us three minutes
and we'll give you the world!"

JESS FERKINS & CASEY WONG

Jess, 32, is cool blond, very poised, and all business.

Casey, 38, Eurasian, suit and tie, flat-top haircut and

lots of teeth stares straight at us with a fixed look of
concern.

CASEY
Good morning. I'm Casey Wong with
Jess Perkins and these are today's
top stories. Pretoria. The threat
of nuclear confrentation in South
Africa escallated today when the
white military government of that
besieged city state unveiled a
French-made neutron bomb and
affirmed its willingness to use
the 3 megaton device as the city’s
last line of defense.

 

RON MILLER'S ANGRY FACE

He's mobbed by REFORTERS as he leaves his office at City
Hall. Two aides follow carrying boxes.

JESS (o.s.)
Ron Miller called it quits today,
relinguishing his City Council seat
after being denied a recount in one
of the closest elections in this
city’s history.

TIGHT GN CASEY WONG

Understated concern, just the facts. Behind him, mini- eee
cam footage of last night's massacre in Old Detroit.

rose to 31 today when three officers
were killed and one critically in-
jured in an exchange of gunfire just
before dawn. Jess?

through thick glass windows... the camera work is

JESS
And, or course, there’s the story
of the enterprising lunar teens who
started their own TV station.

CASEY
Uh-oh, sounds like competition...
(chuckle)
We'll be back.

COMMERCIAL 1

The curves of a WOMAN become the curves of acar. "It's
back..." We're moving around an enormous sleek sedan.
Dual exhaust, mirror paint. “Big is back!“ The Woman’s
reflection walks through the lines of the car and as we
follow her around the front of the car we are suddenly
sucked into the giant shark maw air intake. “" And it’s
got Turbine Power!” In the roar of blue flames, her
animated lips beckon. “6000 BUX. An American
Tradition."

COMMERCIAL 2

A SMARMY DOCTOR shows us around his high-tech clinic:
“Is it time for that big operation? This may be the
most important decision of your life. Come down and
talk to one of our qualified surgeons at the House of
Hearts. We have a complete line of Jarvics and limited
supplies of the new Jenson SportsHart. Thr: ear
warranty, complete financing, qualifies for a health tax
credit. Remember, we care!"

critically injured. Police Union

INT OCF TOWER -- BOARDROOM

Morton, Johnson and Kinney take seats along the wall.
The long boardroom table is reserved for brass. Above
the table a rack of monitors broadcasts the CMI logo
silently. Dominating the table is a delicate model city
of bridges, spires and gardens. If it were real, you'd
want to go there.

AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE

The OLD MAN (a corporate king, benevolent now because
he’s unapproachable) and Dick Jones confer quietly.

OLD MAN
Well, that gives us some time...
What about this police thing? What
seems to be the problem?

JONES eH
The Union’s been bitching ever since
we took over... Now they have a media
issue, and they’re throwing their
weight around... you know, the usual
crap. I’m confident we‘ll turn things
around in the next phase of the
takeover.

OLD MAN eRe

Mmmm. Good. Very good.

(to the room)
OK, let‘’s get started: I’ve had a
dream for more than a decade now,
and I’ve asked you all to share it
with me. In six months we begin

employ the 2 million workers that will
breathe life into this city again we
must pacify Old Detroit.

Although shifts in the tax structure
have created an economy ideal for
corperate growth, community services,
in this case Law Enforcement, have
suffered, I think it’s time we gave
something back. Dick?

SS JONES .
As he stands, the monitors above him roll a slick HH
montage.

JONES

Take a close look at the track
record of this company, and you'll)
see that we have gambled in markets
traditionally regarded as “non—
profit”...hospitals...prisons...
Space exploration...

(he turns on the charisma)
I say good business is where you
find it! As you know, we've entered
into a contract with the city to run
local law enforcement. But at
Security Concepts we believe an effi-
cient police force is only part of
the solution...

 

The information on the monitors above him suggest a
corporation with the scope and influence of an emerging
Western nation. Jones is putting on a good show.

JONES
+»eNO, we need something more. We
need a twenty-four a day police
officer. A cop who doesn’t need
to eat or sleep. A cop with superior
firepower and the reflexes to use it.

He pauses at the boardroom's huge double doors.

(scans the room)
Mr. Kinney, would you come up here
and give us a hand?

KINNEY
(ever eager)
Yes, sir!

Jones opens a sleek black case. Inside is a chrome

SC-257 Magnum. Kinney takes the gun, examines it ee
and looks at ED 209. He's having second thoughts and

Jones makes the most of it.

JONES
Mr. Kinney will help us simulate a
typical arrest and disarming
proceedure. Mr. Kinney, use your
gun in a threatening manner. Point
it at ED 209.

Kinney draws a tentative bead on ED 209. The robot

threat.

Suddenly, a burst of sparks and a sharp pop emanates eee
from ED 209's shoulder joint. Jones is suddenly

concerned. Morton notices. Something is very wrong

here. Kinney tries to get out of the way.

A WOMEN screams as she is grabbed by one of two CREEPS
who are chasing her. She drops her purse and pulls away
from the guy and her dress rips across the front. She's
a goad lacking woman but this isn’t a nice way to see
her. She turns and finds CREEP 2 waiting.

CREEP 2
“Hey, baby, take it easy. We don’t
wanna hurt you.

CREEP 1
{as he grabs her by
her long brown hair)
Way too much hair here for me.

CREEP 2
I know... first we'll give her a tee
haircut...

Creep 2 snaps open his MacSems fighting knife and hacks

at her hair. Tears of fear and humiliation spill down
her face. She elbows Creep 1 and tries to kick Creep 2.

CREEP 2
is getting crazy.

CREEF 2
Are you KIDDING, man...? I‘1ll cut

Robo fires. A bullet burns a hole through the Woman’s wee
dress, and Creep 2 goes down screaming, holding himself,
writhing on the ground with blood between his legs. The

knife clatters to the ground in front of Creep 1. He

looks for a way out.

him around a street sign and cuffs the other. The Woman

SPECTATORS and REPORTERS are kept behind the police line
by Ramierez and Starkweather. Robo Pulls up and gets
out of his car. SWAT team commander LT. HEDGECOCK and a
police CAPTAIN argue as Robo scopes out the problem.

LT. MEDGECOCK
My boys can contain this situation
in ten minutes. We go in with ges

got a good chance of saving the mayor.

Clarence makes himself at home, dumping chunks of

Lewis maneuvers between Piles of rubble. On the seat
next her are two cases of baby food, SPINACH and

An empty space the size of three football fields. The

exposed comlex inner workings. We see flexible steel
“muscles” at work as he hammers at a twisted plate,
Pulling it back from the damaged leg. Lewis drops the
satchel near him. CLANK. Robo stops working and digs
into the satchel. His helmet is badly damaged... the
human eye takes Lewis in.

LEwIs
I wasn‘t sure what you needed...
I sort of grabbed things.

Robo takes several sophisticated hand tools out of the
satchel, then a small cordless Power rachet.

ROBO
Thanks.

He fits a bit on the power rachet and shoves it up under
the lip of his helmet near his temple. ZZZTTT! A
two-inch machine bolt screws out of his head at an angle
and falls to the floor. Now he applies the rachet to
the other side. ZZZTTT! Now he grabs his helmet and
lifts.

She holds the scrap of metal. This is the first time we
see Robo‘s face. It distorts in the makeshift mirror.

Just past the crown of his skull. He touches the back
of his head, feeling the metal in the Place he took

steel “fibula” until it is red hot. He throws the empty
jar aside and it breaks off sOmehwere in the dark.

TINK!

Now he pounds the metal back into place with a hammer .
He stands, Carefully, testing the smoking leg. He grabs
another jar of baby food and opens it, wating as he
walks past the

and opens the leather satchel with his free hand.

grabs one, cocks it, and fires at Joe’s new car.

THUNK! A 20mm hole appears in the side panel, then
BOOM! the front end of the car is blown away. The 6000
SUX lurches foreward like a dead horse.

then passes them out to Leon and Eail.

up ahead, a DOBERMAN with a taped ear snarls is joined
by the first dog, a mangey GERMAN SHEPHERD. Both dogs
start to bark.

Pumps the brakes in a panic. He looks back and sees
that he’s being pushed. He laoks ahead and sees a

kicks in the after-burner and then hits the brakes hard.
THE STORAGE TANK

Emil’s van punches into the tank and stops. The rear
doors blow open and Emil is washed out screaming in a
flood of foaming corrosive chemicals. He touches his
face and it comes away in strings of flesh. Melting
Emil runs blindly through the battle, flailing past

who shoots as he retreats, and smacks into Leon.

into the Pressing Plant.

INT THE PRESSING PLANT -—— THE SUX

Swerves and weaves between ancient hot rolling presses
and the huge girders that support the ceiling. The

Smashes into the back of the SUX. Clarence twists and
turns but Lewis pulls up beside the SUX and grinds into
it, forcing Clarence toward a rolling press.

veers away, dodging machinery. He reaches across the
seat for his Cobra as Lewis pulls in behind him again.
He juggles the big gun, tipping it out the side window.
He looks up.

It's Emil, the incredible melting man. He staggers,
mouth corroded into a Gaping silent scream, arms
flailing in the air.

THE SUX

flattens Emil, smashes up against the length of a
rolling press, and rolls.

INT TURBOCRUISER —- LEWIS

watches the SUX crunch into a support girder. She
brakes to a stop 40 feet away. Clarence is slumped over

then smashes the door open with the butt of his Cobra.
Inside, are dusty consoles full of Switches. Joe lopes
along the catwalk.

smokes and the horn blares. Lewis epproaches carefully.

throws breaker switches and the vast space around him is
suddenly lit. Now he smashes one of the huge glass

Climbs stiffly out of the car. He sees Robo coming and
makes a move for his fallen Cobra A/C.

lifting her face close to his.

Quivers, flexes, moves across her face. She opens her

he's dead.

walks through the rubble of the fallen roof, humming,
toying with a grenade.
