FADE IN:

EXT. HELL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The street is empty save for the garbage that waits for
collection. Rotten haystacks of moldered meat, soiled
diapers, and sour milk crowd the sidewalks and stoops.

A HISS OF STEAM bursts from a sewer grate. It RISES UP like
a spirit, skirting the face of a crumbling Catholic church as
the sound of wind WHISTLES through CREAKING rafters. An oily
rat SKITTERS along a rain gutter matted with dry leaves. Each
noise is exaggerated, amplified into a symphony of sounds.
DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

DROPS OF BLOOD trickle down a stained glass window; cutting a
clear trail across the dusty pane. We trace the blood trail
up to a large CRUCIFIX at the roof’s peak.

DRIP. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

The droplets become rivulets as we reveal a SILHOUETTE draped
over the cross. The silhouette of a devil. A SEARCHLIGHT

from a POLICE HELICOPTER cuts a path across the rooftops,
revealing the devil to be a man in costume.

This is DAREDEVIL.

So forget what you know about superheroes. Because this is
the real world. And in the real world there is no such thing
as “mutant healing’ or “spider sense” to keep a man alive.

In the real world there's just a guy in a mask.

And he’s bleeding to death.

INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

A skylight CREAKS OPEN and the devil slowly hangs down into
the church before hitting the floor with an ugly THUD.

CUT TO:
A PAIR OF SHOES stopping at the sound. CAMERA TILTS UP to
reveal the weathered face of a priest, FATHER EVERETT. He
opens the door to the sanctuary to discover...
THE DEVIL.

Curled up on the altar; like a pill bug swallowing its pain.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED :

The old priest runs to the devil's side and cradles his head
before pulling back his crimson cowl to reveal...

MATT MURDOCK.

The searchlight hits Matt’s eyes through the skylight. But as
we PUSH IN we notice his pupils never dilate. They say your
whole life flashes before you when you die. And it’s true.

Even for a blind man.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

THOSE SAME EYES

before they went blind. We PULL BACK to reveal MATT AT 14
YEARS OLD. He sports a cut lip and a bloody nose as he
stands over a kitchen sink. He splashes his face with cold
water and watches as the blood swirls down the drain...

MATT
Dad? I’m home.

He steps into the living room to find his father passed out
- in front of the T.V. JACK MURDOCK. He’s a handsome man
despite a nose that’s been broken too many times to count.
T.V. RING ANNOUNCER
And the winner, by unanimous decision...
Gene “The Machine’ Conlan!

Matt CLICKS the T.V. off and pries a beer bottle from his
father’s fingers before pulling him to his feet.

JACK
+. .™mm...wha...who...who won?

MATT
Conlan. By decision.

We TRACK THEM as Matt eases his father down the hall...

JACK
I beat ‘em, you know...

MATT
I know, Dad.

JACK
Two...years ago...it was a...

MATT
T.K.O. They threw in the towel.

They pass some old fight bills hanging in the hallway. They
show Jack posing in a red satin boxing robe with two small
horns sewn into the hood. JACK “THE DEVIL" MURDOCK.

IN THE BEDROOM

Matt wrestles his shoes off as Jack notices his cut lip.

JACK
What‘s this?

MATT
Nothin’.

JACK

I told you I don’t want you fighting.

MATT
I don’t fight. I get beat up.
There's a difference.

JACK
Matt...

MATT
I tried to walk away. Like you said.
But they kept giving me shit.

JACK
Don’t curse. What kinda shit?

MATT
(hesitant)
They said you work for Fallon. They said
you’re one of his guys now.

A LONG BEAT as Jack looks to his son’s pleading eyes.
JACK

Think I‘d be bustin’ my hump down at the-
docks if I was working for Fallon?

Matt smiles, relieved.
JACK (CONT'D)
You just keep hitting the books, you hear?
Be a doctor or a lawyer. Not like me.

MATT
Sure, Dad.

JACK
Promise me.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)

MATT
I promise.

Jack pats Matt’s cheek.

JACK
She woulda been proud, Matty...

And with that he falls back asleep. Matt SIGHS and steps
over to the window, gazing out to the rooftops that stretch
forever. As CAMERA CLOSES ON the FULL MOON we

A BIOHAZARD WARNING

in a circular design, FILLING FRAME, before a FORKLIFT
carrying a PALLET OF DRUMS turns to reveal that we're on:

EXT. WATERFRONT LOADING DOCK - DAY

Matt quickly weaves through the busy docks with a card in his
hand, searching for his father when:

VOICE
HEY! KID!

Matt spins around to face the SUPERVISOR.

SUPERVISOR
You trying to get yourself killed?

MATT
I’m looking for my dad. Jack Murdock.

SUPERVISOR
Murdock? He ain’t worked here for over
six months. Now beat it.

He turns, crestfallen, and tosses the card into a mud puddle.
We PUSH IN to reveal it’s his REPORT CARD. Straight A’‘s

Cur TO:
EXT. STREET/DOCKS - DAY
Matt trudges back for home when:

VOICE
Please...please...

He steps AROUND THE CORNER to find a MEAT PACKER in a bloody
apron, shoved up against a wall by a THUG in a ski mask.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MEAT PACKER
You gotta tell Fallon I need more time!
THUG
You're all out of time.
Matt freezes at the voice.

MATT
Dad?

The Thug stops and turns to face us. A LONG BEAT before he
slowly slips his ski mask off to reveal...

JACK MURDOCK.

Matt shakes his head as tears come to his eyes. And then he
turns and runs off down the alley.

JACK
MATT!

ON MATT

Running out toward the loading docks, blinded by tears, his
father chasing behind him. BRAKES SCREECH as...

A TRUCK swerves to avoid him. Loaded with the same barrels
seen earlier. At the same time...

A FORKLIFT swerves as well, its forks up high. They tear
through the barrels as...

Matt looks up. Whitish fluid flies INTO CAMERA as we...
SMASH CUT TO:

BLACKNESS .

We hear the sound of CHURCH BELLS RINGING. And as the sound

grows a ghostly SHADOW WORLD begins to take shape. A world

where sound isn’t just heard--but seen.

A BUS ROARS past us as the shadows collapse and distort into
a monstrous phantasm of visible vibration.

A HORN HONKS,. A CELL PHONE RINGS. A BABY CRIES. With each
noise our shadow world spills and pools, like liquid mercury.

He stops when he sees an empty bed.

JACK (CONT'D)
Matt?

MATT (0.S.)

He turns to find Matt before the open window with his eyes
bandaged. He holds up his hand for silence. Then:

MATT (cont'd)
Do you hear it?

JACK
What?
Matt turns to him.
MATT
Everything.

Jack shakes his head, trying to find some way to tell him.

JACK
I talked to the doctor. He said--

MATT
I’m blind. I know.

JACK
But how--
MATT
I could hear you talking in his office.
Jack looks back to where he was. Impossible.
MATT (CONT’D)
Something’s happening to me. I don’t
know what it is, but I’m not afraid.
Jack bows his head as the guilt washes over him.

JACK
I'm sorry. I’m so sorry...

He breaks down as Matt holds him in his arms. The blind boy
comforting the big fighter as we...

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAY

MUSIC UP: HIGHER by Creed.

Dappled rays of sunlight break through the gray cloud cover
over the Hudson. It’s a new day.

cuT TO:
EXT. ROOF - DAY
Jack has turned the roof into a makeshift gymnasium. He
takes a few tentative swings at an old heavy bag while Matt
sits on a weight bench with a BRAILLE TEXT on his lap. The
agonizing process of learning to read all over again.
Jack sighs--it’s been too long. He turns from the bag just
as Matt SLAMS the book shut. They face each other. A BEAT.
Then Matt picks up the book. And Jack goes back to the bag.
Two fighters on the comeback trail.

CuT TO:
EXT. STREET - DAY
Matt is using his cane in a ‘three-point tap and drag.’ He
steps into the intersection just as the light turns red. A
taxi HONKS as Matt falls back over the curb cursing.

CUT TO:
INT. BOXING RING - NIGHT

Where we see Jack taking a beating against the ropes in his
first boxing match in years. It’s a long road back.

" cur To:
EXT. ROOF - DAY
Matt is back at his braille book. A BREEZE picks up and the
SPEED BAG begins SQUEAKING on its chain. The sound is like
broken glass in his brain. Until Matt focuses all of his
anger and throws his book at the bag across the roof.
And nails it.

He walks over to the bag. And for the first time he doesn’t
fight the sounds that surround him--but lets them in.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

MATT'S POV
as the SQUEAKING slowly burns a silhouette through the
darkness until--WHAM! Matt smiles and hits the bag again.
And again. His hyperacute senses work the bag until it
becomes just a streak of brown leather!

CUT TO:
INT. BOXING RING - NIGHT

As Jack valiantly fights his way out of the corner, backing
his opponent up with a flurry of his own.

CUT TO:
EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY
Matt is back at the crosswalk. An OLD MAN steps off the curb
and Matt WHIPS OUT his cane to stop him--just as a bus almost

flattens him. The Old Man double-takes at the blind boy who
smiles and continues on his way.

cut TO:
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
Matt stands in silhouette against the stars. He slowly
reaches out feeling the air around him. And as we PULL BACK
we reveal that we‘re on the edge of the roof...
Matt does a cartwheel and the CAMERA ROLLS with him, taking
us on a dizzying, vertiginous ride as Matt goes faster and
faster before flipping onto TWO HEATING PIPES.
He SWINGS over them like a gymnast on parallel bars before
dismounting atop a brick smokestack. Matt smiles into the
night as we hear the sound of a CROWD CHEERING him on.

CUT TO:

EXT. CIVIC CENTER - NIGHT

A sign flashes out front in bright neon lights: “LIVE!
TONIGHT! JACK ‘THE DEVIL’ MURDOCK vs. JIMMY PALMIOTTI!”

CuT TO:
INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME
Jack is warming up. Suddenly the door opens to reveal an
older man dressed in an expensive suit. FALLON.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

FALLON
Jack, it’s been a while...

JACK
I don’t work for you no more, Fallon.

Fallon chuckles.

FALLON
Jack, you never stopped. Did you really
think you won those fights on your own?
Wood, Mack, Chichester--they’re all my
fighters. Just like you.

Jack looks down as he realizes the truth.

FALLON (CONT'D)
Now it’s your turn to take a fall.

JACK
What if I say “no?”

FALLON
You know the answer to that. You used to
handle those jobs yourself.

Fallon pats him on the shoulder.
FALLON (CONT’D)
Think about your boy, Jack. I'm sure
you'll do the right thing.
He steps out as we STAY ON Jack’s devastated reaction.

SMASH CUT TO:
THE FIGHT.

Palmiotti is easily fifteen years younger and light years
faster. He hits Jack with an upper-cut that drops him to the
canvas. Jack looks out to see Fallon in the audience.

MATT (0.S.)
C'MON, DAD! GET UP!

And then he sees his son as well. He struggles to his feet.
Palmiotti comes to finish him off. But in his haste he isn't
watching for Jack’s left hook. And it’s a beauty. Palmiotti
is rocked as the crowd ROARS. Jack throws a brutal series of
combinations until--Palmiotti hits the canvas!

RING ANNOUNCER
And the winner...Battlin’ Jack Murdock!

Jack smiles to his beaming son. But then he looks to where
Fallon and his men were sitting. They’re already gone.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

As Jack steps out of the back door to see a black stretch
limousine waiting. He doesn’t bother trying to.run. Instead
he just bows his head. And waits.

JACK
Go on. Get it over with.

EXT. CIVIC CENTER - NIGHT

Matt waits out front for his father when his hyperacute
hearing picks up the sounds of violence. We hear the EXCITED
HEARTBEATS of Fallon’s men as they PUNCH and KICK and LAUGH.

The CRACK of bone gives way to the PULPY sound of spit and
blood. Followed by the RASPY MOAN of his FATHER’S VOICE.

MATT
Dad...?

The sounds are suddenly overwhelmed by one THUNDEROUS BASS
HEARTBEAT. Then the DEATH BLOW. And the MOANING STOPS.

MATT (CONT'D)
DAD!

CcuT TO:

Jack's lifeless body lying in the alley. A single red rose
is dropped onto his bloodied chest.

cuT TO:
Matt running down the alley as Fallon’s limousine speeds past
him. Matt finds his father’s body and holds him in his arms.
He feels for his face. But it’s a stranger’s face now.

MATT (cont'd)
I can’t--I can’t see you...

Matt SOBS as he tries to “see” his father one more time. But
even that has been taken from him.

MATT (cont'd)
I can’t see you, Dad...

CONTINUED:

We CRANE UP from the tragic scene until we stop on the
Catholic church from our opening scene. The stained glass
FACE OF MARY smiles back at us in the moonlight.

MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we have
come here today to seek the truth. We
have come here today to seek justice.

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
INT. COURTHOUSE - PRESENT DAY
CU LADY JUSTICE

The statue is blindfolded, with the scales of justice in one
hand and a sword in the other. We PULL BACK to reveal the
face of attorney MATT MURDOCK addressing a courtroom.

MATT
Lenny Bruce once said that in the halls
of justice, the only justice is out in
the halls. But today you can change all
that. Because today you are justice.

A petite but tough-looking girl is sitting beside Matt's
partner, FRANKLIN “FOGGY” NELSON.

MATT (CONT'D)

The criminal case against Quesada and
Smith was dismissed due to the arresting
officer's failure to read the defendants
their Miranda Rights. This civil suit is
the victim's only recourse.

(beat)
But Angela Sutton doesn’t seek damages.
She seeks the truth. She seeks justice.
And the chance to get on with her life.

QUESADA

on the witness stand. He wears one of those moustaches that
you only find on porn stars or dentists.

MATT
Mr. Quesada, would you please tell the
jury the sequence of events leading up to
the night of June 30th?

Quesada sighs, bored with this.

(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:

QUESADA
Me and Smitty--we was the last to leave
Josie's Bar that night.

We slowly CLOSE ON Quesada as he continues. As he does we
hear what Matt hears--the sound of his HEARTBEAT ESCALATING.

QUESADA (CONT'D)
Angie was closing up and asked if we
wanted to stay and party after.

We PUSH CLOSER until we’re right up against Quesada’s chest.
And then we push RIGHT THROUGH to see his HEART BEATING.

QUESADA (CONT’D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
A few drinks and she was good to go.
Said she wanted to take us both on.

The HEARTBEAT SKIPS. We suddenly PULL OUT of his chest and
WHIP ACROSS the room to Matt's reaction. Busted.

MATT
Mr. Quesada, you do understand that
perjury is a federal offense?

QUESADA
Hey, I know what happened.

MATT
I’m sure that you do.

Foggy TAPS a stack of photos onto the table. Matt traces the
sound and effortlessly scoops them up on his way to the jury.

MATT (CONT'D)
(passing them out)
These are photographs of the victim taken
at Mercy Hospital that night.
(back to Quesada)
. I wonder, Mr. Quesada, did she ask you
for the cuts and bruises as well?

Quesada smiles, lecherous.

QUESADA
Trust me. She loved every minute of it.

The girl softly starts to cry as Foggy awkwardly pats her

shoulder. Matt has to restrain himself from throttling the
creep right here on the spot.

(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED: (2)

MATT
No further questions, Your Honor.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. COURTHOUSE - EARLY EVENING

As Matt and Foggy step outside, anger and disappointment
etched on their faces.

FOGGY
Look, we knew it was a risk going in--

MATT
Why? Because she’s from the Kitchen and
not the Upper East Side?

FOGGY

Because she had a drug problem. Juries

don’t like their victims to be flawed.

They judged her past and not her case.
MATT

How is she supposed to sleep at night

knowing that they‘re out there?

They stop and look out to the city together.
FOGGY
(sighs)
You wanna get drunk?

MATT
Yeah. But not tonight.

We CLOSE ON the darkness in Matt's eyes.

MATT (CONT’D)
I’ve got work to do.

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
MUSIC UP: EVEL KNIEVEL by Ceasefire vs. The Deadly Avenger
ON MATT
He pulls his hood down over his head as we SNAP ZOOM 360
DEGREES to reveal DAREDEVIL in full costume. The body suit
is DEEP CRIMSON--nearly black--and reveals every sinewy

muscle of his taut frame. The boots are high-impact for
optimal speed. The gloves wire-mesh for optimal damage.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:

CU CANE
Matt hits a hidden stud and the curved end of its handle
straightens. He snaps the cane apart into two sections.

This is Daredevil’'s BILLY CLUB. The symbol of his handicap
transformed into a weapon of his abilities.

ON DAREDEVIL

LEAPING from rooftop to rooftop; his senses guiding him along
the way. He suddenly SWAN DIVES off of a ledge and PLUMMETS
TEN STORIES to the street below. He smiles as he falls. The
accident took his sight. But it took his fear as well.

He shoots a 50-FOOT NYLON CORD from his billy club, catches
the railing of a fire escape, and SWINGS UP onto the roof of
JOSIE'S BAR. A murky shit-hole down near the shipyards.

CUT TO:
INT. JOSIE’S BAR - NIGHT
MUSIC UP: WAITING TO DIE by Planet Earth
Dozens of bad asses covered in tribal tattoos and multiple
piercings drift in and out of a haze of cigarette smoke.
Everyone is either drunk, wired on meth, or both.
CU TEQUILA SHOT
as its raised in a toast by Quesada.

QUESADA
To the justice system!

Smith laughs as they throw back their shots.

QUESADA (CONT’D)
Line ‘em up, Josie! I'm ready to par-ty!

JOSIE, the no-nonsense owner, glares at them both.
JOSIE
You got a lotta nerve coming in here
after what you did.

SMITH
Hey, it's a free country, baby.

QUESADA
We‘re proof of that.

(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:

Quesada and Smith laugh. Suddenly, we hear a ROAR as TWO
BIKERS ride their Harley Davidsons right into the bar.

JOSIE
Hey hey! Bikes outside!

They push their front tires up against the wall.

JOSIE (cont'd)
No burn-outs, you assholes!

A Biker Chick lifts her shirt and they GUN THEIR ENGINES in
response, spinning their back tires in a burn-out contest.
BLACK SMOKE fills the bar as they burn rubber, their engines
whining LOUDER AND LOUDER as everyone CHEERS.

JOSIE (cont’d)
(sighs)
I shoulda opened a fuckin’ Starbucks...

Suddenly, the death-metal music is cut. EIGHT by Junkie xL
begins as everyone turns to look.

The only thing visible through the thick black smoke is a
pool table light, swinging back and forth. And then...

The SHADOW OF A DEVIL appears through the smoke. It slowly
BEGINS TO GROW across the length of the bar.

SMITH
Holy shit. It’s him. He‘’s real.

QUESADA
(feeling no pain)
Yeah. Somebody's fucked, man...

Quesada downs another tequila shot before noticing that the
shadow has stopped over him. Two RED EYES flicker back
through the smoke, like a demon straight from hell.

QUESADA (CONT'D)
What--what do you want?

DAREDEVIL
I want to hear you say it.

QUESADA
Say what?

DAREDEVIL
That you're guilty.

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED: (2)

Quesada looks at the guys in the bar. He feels the weight of
the steel strapped to his sides. He smiles. Big.

QUESADA
Okay. So I’m guilty...

Quesada draws twin .45's and aims them straight at the devil.
We TRACK THE MOB as they follow suit, whipping out a virtual
ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY before the shadow of the vigilante.

QUESADA (CONT’D)
What are you gonna do about it?

We CLOSE ON Daredevil as he smiles back.

DAREDEVIL
Raise hell.

And with that he LEAPS INTO THE MOB! Daredevil attacks in a
hybrid fighting style of martial arts mixed with street
fighting. The brutal KICKS, PUNCHES, and ELBOWS come hard,
fast and violent. Blood SPURTS. Bones CRACK. Teeth FLY.

This is not Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
NEW ANGLE

as the lights over the billiard tables SWING BACK AND FORTH
in the melee. Combined with the smoke from the motorcycle
burn-outs it creates a STROBE LIGHT EFFECT that confuses
everyone in the bar. Everyone except for Daredevil. We
watch as he lets his extraordinary senses take over...

CLIIIICK!

‘Daredevil turns as we WHIP PAN across the room and PUSH RIGHT
DOWN THE BARREL of a Casull .454! We see the enormous bullet
slide into its chamber before we WHIP BACK to Daredevil who
throws his billy club in response. We TRACK THE BILLY CLUB
back like a scud missile as it sails just wide of the Gunman--

GUNMAN
HAH!

--before RICOCHETING off the wall and DRILLING him in the
back of the head! It snaps back into Daredevils hand as--

CHA-CHUNK!
A STEEL MAGAZINE is slammed into place. Daredevil shoots his

billy club up over a BEAM and uses it to RUN THE WALL as the
bullets fly. And there are hundreds of them.

CONTINUED: (3)

DAREDEVIL'S POV

Where we see the bullets represented as STREAMS OF SOUND.
They zip above him, below him, and through his legs as he
conterts his body while running across the wall!

The bullets chase him over to the other side of the room,
DROPPING several bikers and skinheads by mistake.

QUESADA & SMITH

make a break for it. They dive right through the plate glass
window with a CRAAASH!

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. JOSIE‘S BAR - SAME
Breathless, Quesada and Smith stop at the corner. In the
colorless alley we notice a red DD has been spray-painted on
the wall. The local gangs have tagged this as a warning:
You're entering the Devil's Neighborhood.

QUESADA
No way he’s getting outta there...

Behind Quesada, a RED NYLON LOOP slips down around Smith's
neck and draws tight as Smith struggles silently.

QUESADA (CONT’D)
(oblivious)
They'll ventilate his ass. Right, Smitty?
Smith is lifted half out of frame--his fat legs stop kicking.

QUESADA (CONT’D)
Smitty?

He turns to see Smith hanging lifeless from the fire escape.
Quesada SCREAMS as he turns and runs down the alley.

ANGLE ABOVE - DAREDEVIL'S POV

Following Quesada's footsteps from on high. And then they
disappear down into the cacophony of the subway station.

CUT TO:
INT. SUBWAY - SAME
As Quesada trips and falls down the stairs. He struggles to
his feet and looks back to see...

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

THE DEVIL IS COMING.
Quesada fires back wildly until the barrel CLICKS empty.

QUESADA
GET AWAY! GET AWAY FROM ME!

Daredevil steps from the shadows. No longer with the face of
a hero. But with the face of a madman.

DAREDEVIL
You raped a girl. In Hell’s Kitchen.
That's my neighborhood.
QUESADA
I’'11 give you whatever you want! Just
say it! What do you want?
Daredevil looms.

DAREDEVIL
Justice.

Quesada starts to scream. But then--VROOM!--a subway train
ROARS past them on the other side of the tracks.

DAREDEVIL’S POV

As his hyperacute senses are OVERWHELMED; the sensory images
of his brain SHATTERED like a million shards of glass.

SUBWAY PLATFORM

Daredevil stumbles, momentarily helpless. Quesada reaches
into his boot and pulls out a .38. He points the snub-nosed
barrel right up against Daredevil’s forehead and laughs.

QUESADA
Back to hell, diablo.

But as the hammer COCKS the sound takes us back into--
DAREDEVIL’S POV

As his radar returns. Suddenly, we hear the CRACK of
Quesada‘s leg as Daredevil lashes out with his billy club.

QUESADA (CONT'D)
AAAHHH!

Quesada falls back down onto the tracks, his leg bent at an

ugly right angle. He looks up to see Daredevil bathed in
white, then turns to see the light coming around the corner.

(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED: (2)

DAREDEVIL
That tunnel of light--it’s not heaven.

Quesada’s SCREAMS are cut short beneath the subway train.

VOICE
HEY YOU!

Daredevil turns as TWO TRANSIT COPS run toward him, drawing
their guns as the subway rumbles past.

TRANSIT COP
HANDS UP!

Daredevil raises his hands still holding the billy club. It
HOOKS the end railing of the train as the cops stop in
amazement to watch the figure go FLYING down the tunnel.
SMASH CUT TO:
CRIME SCENE TAPE
Cordoning off the subway tracks. A CIGARETTE BUTT rolls INTO
FRAME before a MAN ducks under the yellow tape. BEN URICH.
He wears an old Jets windbreaker over jeans and sneakers.

cop
Hey! You can't go past there!

Urich flashes press credentials before the Cop waves him in.
A squatty DETECTIVE MANOLIS grimaces as Urich approaches.

DET. MANOLIS
The big story’s at Josie’s tonight.

URICH
So what are you doing here, Nick?

Manolis glares as Urich lights up another unfiltered Camel.
DET. MANOLIS
You‘re wasting your time, Urich.
There’s nothing to see here.

Urich glances over in time to see Quesada’s face being
covered with a white sheet.

URICH
Jose Quesada...

As they carry him past we see it’s only his torso. A second
stretcher follows with the lower half of his body.

EXT, MATT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A worn brownstone in Hell’s Kitchen. We see the silent
shadow of a devil slipping through a rooftop skylight.

cuT TO:

INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Matt strips off his costume to reveal the SCARS that cross
his body, like some kind of flesh-toned, patchwork quilt.
Badges of honor from the street wars of the past.

NEW ANGLE

The apartment is as spare as a monastery. One couch. One
chair. No coffee tables or lamps to bump into. No paintings
or photographs to admire. Just one large BAS RELIEF on the
wall; a tangle of ANGELS and DEVILS. Tactile art.

IN THE KITCHEN

Where we see Matt's Answering machine blinking. He presses
one of the BRAILLE BUTTONS before turning to the sink. BEEP!

WOMAN'S VOICE
Matt, it’s Heather.

ON MATT
wincing at the cut on his cheek. Or maybe her voice.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Are you there?
(sighs)
Of course you’re not there. You're never
there. At least not for me.

Matt leans over the sink as blood drips from his cheek. He
turns on the sink and drowns his head under the water.

WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT‘D)

I didn’t want to do this over the phone.
But it’s not like you give me a choice.

(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:

As blood swirls down the drain we realize this is the same
ritual he had as a boy. The bleeding just got heavier.

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I mean--it'’s been three months now and
I’ve never even seen your apartment.

Matt opens a cabinet to reveal bottles of disinfectants, band-
aids, gauze, and Peroxide--the real world result of putting
your body on the line night after night. He dabs Peroxide
onto his cut cheek before swabbing it in orange Betadine.

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Every time we sleep together I wake up in
the morning alone.
He opens another cabinet to reveal a pharmacy of painkillers.
WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I mean, Jesus, where do you go at three
o’clock in the morning?

Matt pushes aside the Tylenol, then the Demerol, before
grabbing the Vicodin.

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT‘D)
I thought that if I was patient enough
you'd let me in. That we'd take our
relationship to the next level.
He pops two Vicodin and chews them into a sour white powder.

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
Then I realized...this is the next level.

Matt slides open a third drawer to reveal a white bag full of
Epsom Salts. He scoops up a handful and steps into...

THE LIVING ROOM.
He stops before what appears to be a coffin. But then he
opens the lid to reveal it’s a FLOATATION TANK. He drops the
Epsom Salts into the tank and strips off his costume.
WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)

Good-bye, Matt. I hope you find whatever

it is you‘re looking for.
CLICK.

Matt slides into the warm water and closes his eyes.

MATT
‘Bye, Heather.

A brief moment of silence. But then we hear the gradual rise
of voices from his neighborhood:

VOICE #1
We’ve got a caucasian, female, with a
gunshot wound to the chest--

VOICE #2
Suspect is in custody. Cordoza, Vincent.
En route to Precinct Six--

VOICE #3
E.M.T.'s on the scene, request police
escort to Mercy Hospital--

VOICE #1
Cancel that escort. Victim has expired.
Repeat, victim has--
Matt CLOSES the door of the tank. And only now, with his
sensitive skin relieved of touch, his hyperacute hearing
deadened to sound, can he finally find peace, —
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
INT. TAO - DAY
A giant gold Buddha dominates the super chic restaurant.
FISK (0.S.)
I'm so glad we've found this time to sit
down together, Mr. Urich.

We PULL BACK from the Buddha to reveal a MASSIVE MAN sitting
across the table from the reporter.

WILSON FISK.

Six~foot-seven and 450 pounds. He looks more like Buddah
than Buddah does. But what some may mistake for obesity is
actually grotesquely over-developed muscle.

At Fisk’s side (always at his side) sits his diminutive

assistant, WESLEY, while TWO BODYGUARDS stand watch at the

door. Urich watches as Fisk's huge hands gracefully work a “
pair of chopsticks over a giant plate of sushi. —,

CONTINUED:

URICH .
I've been trying to get an interview for
over a year, Mr. Fisk. Why now?

FISK
I'm well aware of the value of publicity.
Even from a paper such as yours.

URICH
Or maybe one of your companies is going
public--say your spice business--and you
want some spin before it does?

Fisk smiles. He‘’s good. .

FISK
Of course, I can’t confirm that or I'd be
violating federal trade law.

URICH
Of course. It’s a long way from the old
neighborhood. Isn’t it, Mr. Fisk?

FISK
You can take the boy out of the Bronx,
but you can never take the Bronx out of
the boy. My net worth may now be north
of ten billion dollars, but I still
believe that a little dirt on a man’s
hands is a sign of success.

URICH
Let‘s talk about the dirt.

Fisk chuckles.

URICH (CONT'D)
Have you ever heard of the Kingpin?

Fisk's smile fades slightly.
FISK
Of course. My father used to tell me
stories about the Kingpin when I was a
child. How one man ruled all of the
crime in New York City. Preposterous.
Wesley nods, echoing his words: “preposterous.”

URICH
Maybe. Or maybe not.

(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED: (2)

FISK
Of course, you're the one who writes
about the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen. What
is it that you call him again?

URICH
‘Daredevil.‘

FISK
‘Daredevil.’ I wonder why the New York
Times hasn't picked up on it yet?

URICH
Maybe they don’t like being scooped.

FISK
Yes, I’m sure that’s it.

Fisk smiles condescendingly as Urich returns to his notes.

URICH
-I understand that you‘ve been buying up
the harbor through several different
holding companies.

FISK
You obviously have me mistaken for
Nikolas Natchios, the shipping tycoon.
(grins)
Now there’s a powerful man.

URICH
I have a source that says Natchios is
only a soldier for the Kingpin.

FISK
Your very own ‘Deep Throat.’ How
exciting for you, Mr. Urich. You‘’ll
have to let me know how it ends up.

URICH
I will.

Fisk extends a bowl of fish.

FISK
Now try the kimchi, it's to die for.

Wesley mouths the words: “to-die-for.”

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Fisk steps into his stretch limousine with Wesley and the two
Bodyguards in tow. Urich lights up another Camel as he
watches them drive off, shrouded behind tinted windows.

cuT TO:

INT. LIMOUSINE - SAME

Where the two massive Bodyguards sit facing Fisk and Wesley
in the back of the limousine.

FISK
Someone’s been talking.

WESLEY
That’s impossible. The only ones who
know anything are Natchios and us.

FISK
This source of Urich’s would have to be
either very foolish or very weak. And
Natchios is neither.

Fisk runs his fingers over the heavy crystal end of his cane.
FISK (CONT'D)
You know, Wesley, in ancient times you'd
cut your bodyguard’s tongue off his first
day on the job...

' Fisk suddenly BRAINS Bodyguard #1 with his cane! BLOOD
SPLATTERS across the tinted windows as Wesley SCREAMS.

Bodyguard #2 reacts. But not quick enough. Fisk CLUTCHES
his windpipe with one massive paw and SNAPS his neck in two.

And then it’s over.
Two men dead. In a matter of seconds.

FISK (CONT'D)
Handkerchief.

Wesley hands a handkerchief to Fisk who calmly wipes off the
crystal setting on his cane.

FISK (CONT’D)
Now, when does our friend Natchios get
back into town?

Wesley can’t take his eyes off of the corpses.

(CONTINUED)

WESLEY
Tomorrow. Noon.

Fisk glances at his reflection in the window.

FISK
If the press wants a Kingpin, I'll give
them a Kingpin. On a silver platter.

He lights a Cuban cigar.

Get me Bullseye.

TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.0O.)

King Kirby and Excelsior...

Amongst the CACOPHONY OF NOISE we single out a MAN sitting
close to the track. He wears a long, blue leather coat and
his head is shorn clean like a bullet. CAMERA SLOWLY SWINGS
AROUND HIM to reveal the TATTOO on the back of his head.

A BULL’S-EYE.

TRACK ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
It‘s Gimme Some Sugar and Excelsior...
Gimme Some Sugar and Excelsior rounding
the corner with King Kirby in third...

VOICE
Bang! Bang!

Bullseye turns to see a LITTLE BOY sitting beside him. He
wears a cowboy hat and shoots at the horses with a cap gun.

LITTLE BOY

off the table. The wine glass SHATTERS as red Cabernet
bleeds across the white cement floor.

WAITRESS
Oh dear. I'11 be right back to clean
that up for you...

And as she turns to leave Bullseye holds up the STEM OF THE
BROKEN WINE GLASS; it's jagged end is as sharp as a knife.
He looks over to the Boy and holds his finger to his lips.

BULLSEYE

TRACK ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Its Gimme Some Sugar by a length! Gimme
Some Sugar heading for the stretch!

Bullseye suddenly spins and WHIPS the glass stem out into the
track piercing the neck of the lead Jockey! The Jockey falls
to the track where he’s TRAMPLED by the other horses!

TRACK ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
OH MY! Gimme Some Sugar’s jockey is
down! A jockey is down! And now it’s
Excelsior at the finish!

Paramedics rush to the rider as Excelsior crosses the finish
line. It’s the black one with the spot on his nose.

TRACK ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
It’s Excelsior followed by King Kirby in
second and Saving Grace in third!
Bullseye smiles back at the Little Boy.

Below that, in much smaller letters,

NEW ANGLE

As we reveal Foggy and Matt sitting with their morning
coffee. Foggy reads Matt the story:

FOGGY
‘...police are still investigating.’
(looks up)
I bet they are. Check this out.
(reading)
‘Witnesses say Quesada and Smith were
singled out by the demonic vigilante
known as Daredevil.’

MATT
Here we go again...
FOGGY
Wait, it gets better.

(reading)
‘A policeman on the scene reports that
the suspect flew’--got that?--‘flew down
the subway tunnel to make his escape.'

MATT
It’s the Post, Foggy. That’s one step up
from the National Enquirer.

FOGGY
There must be something to these stories.
We've been hearing them for years.

MATT
Yeah, like the alligators that live in
the sewers.

FOGGY
That's true about the alligators. I’m
serious. I got a friend in sanitation.

Foggy smiles at an artist’s rendering of Daredevil. It looks
like something out of H.R. Geiger.

FOGGY (cont'd)
I don’t know what scares me more--that
the Devil has come to New York or that
some nut job is dressing up ina
Halloween costume to fight crime.
(chuckles)
I’d hate to see that guy’s therapy bills.

MATT
(smile fading)
Yeah...
FOGGY

Speaking of bills, we got our first
payment from Mr. Lee this morning.

Matt knows what's coming and tries to change the subject.

MATT
Great. Could you pass the sugar?

Foggy unscrews the lid on the SALT SHAKER and slides it over.
FOGGY
Actually, it’ not great. He paid us in
fluke. That's a fish, Matt. Did you
know that? Because I sure didn’t.

MATT
He goes fishing on weekends.

FOGGY
And I go salsa dancing. But you don’t
see me offering to dance for my bills.

MATT
And a grateful city thanks you.

Matt pours the salt into his coffee.
FOGGY
We can’t keep taking these pro bono
cases. We need better clients.
Foggy squirts ketchup into the creamer.

MATT
Define “better.”

FOGGY
Guilty rich people. Cream?

MATT

Remember what we talked about in college?
How we wanted to make a difference?

FOGGY
I remember. I just thought that we
would’ve sold out by now.

Matt pours the ketchup/creamer into his salted coffee. But
before he drinks it he suddenly turns and SNIFFS the air.

MATT
Mmmm...

Foggy’s seen this before.

FOGGY
Where-where-where?

MATT
Behind you.

Foggy looks over his shoulder to see...

ELEKTRA NATCHIOS.

An exotic beauty with a wild mane of black hair. Her body is
equal parts muscle and sensuality. And although she’s
dressed casually (low-slung hip-huggers, baby doll t-shirt,
belly ring) she still has the aura of privilege about her.

MATT (CONT'D)
Tell me.

FOGGY
You want the truth?

MATT
And nothing but.

FOGGY
She's hideous.

Matt grins. He knows Foggy’s lying, of course. Foggy picks
up a spoon and uses it to check his reflection. And as he
does Matt deftly swi i .
FOGGY (cont'd)
As your attorney in this matter I must
advise against any further action.
Foggy puts the spoon down to see--Matt’s already gone.

cafe. He ‘accidentally’ bumps into Elektra‘s table.

MATT
Excuse me.

Elektra never looks up from her Village Voice.

ELEKTRA
Sure.

MATT
Seems every time I get the lay of the
land here they rearrange the furniture.

ELEKTRA

MATT

I was looking for some sugar.
ELEKTRA

Right in front of you.

MATT
Could you be more specific?

ELEKTRA
What are you--?

And then she looks up and freezes.

MATT
(helpfully)
‘Blind?’
ELEKTRA

Oh! Oh, I‘m so sorry I...here...

She holds up the sugar and places it in his hands. And as
she does Matt touches her hand and smiles.

MATT
Funny. I can’t tell where the sugar ends
and you begin.
A LONG BEAT as Elektra looks him over.

ELEKTRA
Does that line actually work for you?

Foggy CHUCKLES before sipping his coffee--and BLOWING IT

Friend of yours?

MATT
Never seen him before.

She finally laughs.
MATT (CONT'D)

(offering his hand)
Matt Murdock.

(taking it)
Nice to meet you, Matt Murdock.
And then she gets up and starts for the door.

MATT
Wait. I didn’t get your name.

She glances back.

ELEKTRA
That's because I didn't give it.
She walks out of the coffee shop as Foggy hoots:

FOGGY
DE-NIED!

Matt smiles ruefully. And then he grabs his cane.

FOGGY (CONT'D)
Hey...where you going?

MATT
To file an appeal.

FOGGY
We have to be at the courthouse at twelve
o’clock. I'm not going to wait for you.

MATT
I‘1l be there.

FOGGY
Twelve o’clock!

past a large oak tree as a BREEZE RUSTLES through the leaves,
momentarily scattering the trail when:

ELEKTRA (0.S.)
What do you want?

NEW ANGLE

as Matt whirls around to reveal Elektra with her arms
crossed. She looks pissed.

MATT
I just wanted to know your name.
ELEKTRA
I don’t like being followed. So don’t.
She turns to leave. Matt reaches for her arm. Bad idea.

MATT
Hey wait--

She expertly SNATCHES his wrist in a Kenpo lock.

ELERTRA
And I don’t like being touched.

MATT
Why don’t you tell me what you do like
and we'll start from there?
Matt suddenly collapses her hold and reverses their hands
into a classic Wuxia guard. Elektra reacts, surprised.
ELEKTRA
How did you do that?

MATT
Ancient Chinese secret.

(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED :

She offers a little smile and deflects his guard before
lashing out with an iron claw. Matt cross-blocks it.

MATT (CONT'D)
That’s a shao-lin technique.

ELEKTRA
So is this.

She backs him up with a succession of STRIKES AND LUNGES.
Her style is graceful and deadly; ballet meets Kung Fu.

MATT
(sensing)
You're holding back...

ELEKTRA
Yes.

MATT
Don’t.

She ups the attack. They circle each other as a HOMELESS MAN
stops to watch this bizarre show.

ELEKTRA
What are you? A sensei?

MATT
Nope. A lawyer.

HOMELESS MAN
Kick his ass!

Elektra laughs and doubles-up her attack. The fight is
‘growing more intense--but also more playful. Sexual even.
They sense each other’s every move--like fighting a mirror.
MATT
All this just to get your name?
ELEKTRA
Try asking for my number.

She drives Matt back until he PUSHES OFF a park bench and
wraps her arms. He‘’s got her beat. And she knows it.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
I never fall for the same move twice.

MATT
I‘11 remember that.

He releases her. Elektra finally offers her hand.

ELEKTRA

Matt takes it. In a split-second she FLIPS HIM to the ground

MATT
So can I call you?

She smiles. And then she starts to laugh as we

CuT TO:
Matt and Elektra walking through the park together.

MATT (CONT'D)
Who did you train with?

ELEKTRA
It was always changing. My father had me
study with a different sensei every year
since I was five years old.

MATT
Sounds like he wanted to turn you into
some kind of warrior.

ELEKTRA
No. Just not a victim.
(changing the subject)
What about you? How does a blind man
learn to fight like that?

MATT
(a la “Karate Kid”)
“Wax on...wax off...”

She laughs and punches him in the arm as Matt winces. Damn
she's strong. We hear a car horn HONKING as she turns to see
a black limousine pulling up along the road. She SIGHS.

ELEKTRA
He always finds me.

You need a bodyguard?

ELEKTRA
My father can be a little over-

Natchios as in Nikolas Natchios?

The horn HONKS again.

ELERTRA (CONT’D)
I really do have to go.

How will I find you if you won't give

ELEKTRA
You won’t.

She leans over and kisses Matt's cheek.

daughter from his first marriage, eloped
with a semi-colored fellah from Long

Let's just say he’s got a little cream in

himself on that internet. Don’t ask me
to explain. They got me a computer last
year for Christmas but I won't use it
because I'm afraid it'll start a fire...

BULLSEYE

sitting in the seat next to her. He’s listening to Korn's

courtroom we see why: Matt is facing the wrong way.

ON CORDOZA
as he whispers to Foggy:

CORDOZA
He‘s facing the wrong way.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
FOGGY .
Don't worry. Matt’s got ‘em right where
he wants ‘em.
CORDOZA
Right...
ON MATT

as she suddenly stops and turns back to the jury.

MATT
Just kidding.

The jury LAUGHS. They love him. But not the no-nonsense
JUDGE. She’s clearly seen this trick of his before.

JUDGE
Does this defense come with a two-drink
minimum, Mr. Murdock?

MATT
No Your Honor. I just wanted to show the
jury what it's been like for Vincent
Cordoza. Like talking to a wall.

Matt steps before the jury as he concludes:

MATT (CONT'D)
But today his story will be heard. Today
the truth comes out. And with your help,
justice will be found. Thank you.

Foggy steps over to help guide Matt back to his seat. Maybe
overkill, but the jury doesn’t know that.

SMASH CUT TO:
OFFICER POLLINA

On the witness stand. He’s clean-cut, honest-looking, as he
answers the Prosecutor's questions:

POLLINA
We were a block away when we got the call
of shots being fired. When we arrived on
the scene Miss Tazio was lying dead on
the steps of her apartment. We found
Cordoza in the alley, incoherent, and
still holding the murder weapon...

Foggy sighs. This is not going to be easy. He glances to
the back of the courtroom.

(CONTINUED)
46.
CONTINUED: (2)

FOGGY
Wonder what he’s doing here?

MATT
Who?

NEW ANGLE
to reveal Ben Urich sitting down. Watching the trial..

FOGGY
That Daredevil reporter from the Post.

Now it’s Matt’s turn to look rattled...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Matt steps down the sidewalk for home when we hear FOOTSTEPS
behind him. The footsteps GROW CLOSER. He turns the corner
towards his apartment. Tenses as the footsteps follow. But
then he catches an intoxicating scent and stops.

MATT
Does this mean you want a re-match?

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal...
ELEKTRA
standing behind him on the sidewalk.
ELEKTRA
How did you know I wasn’t a mugger?
MATT
Muggers don’t smell like Chanel No. 5.

She smiles.

ELEKTRA
I was in the neighborhood.

MATT
On purpose?
Elektra LAUGHS.
ELEKTRA

I told you I'd find you...

MATT AND ELEKTRA

walking through the sidewalks of the Kitchen at night,
sharing a slice of real New York pizza.

ELEKTRA (CONT’D)
I've died and gone to heaven...

MATT
Yeah. Thank God there are still some
places where you can’t find a Pizza Hut.

ELEKTRA
You really love it here, don’t you?
Matt smiles and nods.

MATT
The Kitchen’s like family. Sometimes
it’s the Manson Family--

She laughs.

: MATT (CONT’D)
Co --but we all look out for each other.
Watch your step here...

She takes his arm as they walk around an open sewer grate.

‘ ELEKTRA
Thanks, I didn’t see--
(she stops, reacts)
' How do you do that?

( MATT

After you take a few headers onto the
sidewalk you tend to remember where the
' hazards are.

Elektra smiles as she breathes in the night. We notice she
\ still hasn't let go of his arm. Matt notices too. Smiles.
i ELEKTRA
' It’s nice to have history some place. I
' feel like I'm always shuttling between
planes and hotels and countries. There’s

: a ball tomorrow night at my father’s
hotel that I’m absolutely dreading.

o MATT
\ So don’t go.

(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED: (2)

ELEKTRA
It‘s not that simple. My father needs
me. We're all we have left.

Matt suddenly looks up to the sky.

MATT
Did you bring an umbrella?

ELEKTRA
Why?

Suddenly, THUNDER BOOMS as the rain begins to come.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Come on!

Elektra ducks under an awning in the alley, laughing. But
Matt stays out in the rain, welcoming it like an old friend.

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
You’re getting soaked!

MATT
You know what a nice day is? When
there's a breeze. Scraps of leaves and
paper dance down the sidewalks giving me
a world of detail I'd usually miss...
(smiling)
But a perfect day is when it rains.

We hear the MUTED PATTER of the raindrops now, hitting the
leaves overhead, as Elektra listens to Matt’s world.

MATT (CONT'D)
Suddenly there's a roof to the universe
..and everything that was shapeless is
given contours and textures...

He stops and inhales the world around him. *
MATT (CONT'D) *

Car exhaust washes away replaced by the *

smell of earth and grass...and for a *

*

moment everything is clear...

MATT'S POV

Where we see the rain visualized as DROPS OF SOUND. Elektra
steps closer as they bounce off of her shoulders, her hair,
the bridge of her nose, until they reveal her in a perfect
Silhouette. She's even more beautiful than he imagined.

As she takes his hand and places it on her face.
CU FINGERTIPS

as Matt slowly caresses her delicate features, the raindrops
streaming between his fingers and her cheeks in rivulets.

MATT (CONT'D)
You are so beautiful.

They start to kiss. Matt losing himself in the moment...
And then the VOICES start.
The VOICES that only Matt Murdock can hear.

VOICE #1
Take the watch! Just don’t hurt me!

VOICE #2
Crank? Base? Watchoo want, mistah?
Cuz I got ‘em all.

VOICE #3
Take the money outta the register!

Matt grits his teeth.

MATT
No...

ELEKTRA
What is it?

MATT
Nothing...

ELEKTRA
Matt?

Matt grimaces. Determined to shut them out. But then we
hear the voice of a LITTLE BOY crying.

LITTLE BOY‘S VOICE
Please! Please don’t hurt me!

ABUSIVE FATHER’S VOICE
Don't you run from me, boy!

(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED: (4)

And he can’t shut them out anymore.

MATT
I have to go.

ELEKTRA
Matt?

MATT
I’m sorry...

Matt hurries off as we STAY ON Elektra’s puzzled reaction.
SMASH CUT TO:

THE ROOFTOPS

Matt rips open his shirt to reveal the CRIMSON DOUBLE D on
the costume he wears underneath. His face a mask of rage.

MATT
One night. That's all I wanted.
One Goddamn night to myself...
CU CANE

as it's snapped apart into Daredevil’s billy club. It’s
folded and holstered as we TILT UP to the face of DAREDEVIL.

DAREDEVIL
Say your prayers, asshole.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

An ABUSIVE FATHER stumbles down the hallway with greasy hair
hanging over bloodshot eyes. His voice is thick, drugged.

ABUSIVE FATHER (0.S.)
WHERE ARE YOU? LITTLE BASTARD!

He pulls the belt from his pants and SLAPS it against the
walls as he goes. He stops to see the WINDOW IS OPEN.

ABUSIVE FATHER (CONT’D)
Did I say you could open this window?
You little son of a bitch?

We hear WHIMPERING coming from under the stairs. The Father

stumbles over and yanks the LITTLE BOY out before throwing
him up against the wall. The boy covers his ears, CRYING.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

ABUSIVE FATHER (CONT'D)
LISTEN WHEN I TALK TO YOU!

He raises his belt over his head when--Daredevil’s gloved
hand comes into frame and grabs him by the wrist!

ABUSIVE FATHER (CONT‘D)
What--?

Daredevil TWISTS his arm and CRACKS it at the elbow! The
Father HOWLS IN PAIN as he crumples to his knees.

DAREDEVIL
See how it feels?

ABUSIVE FATHER
I‘11 kill you, motherf--!

DAREDEVIL
Wrong answer.

He GRABS him by the neck and YANKS him up off the floor,
shouting at him in the man’s own words:

DAREDEVIL (CONT’D)
‘LISTEN-WHEN-I-TALK-TO-YOU! ’

Daredevil’s about to go off when:

LITTLE BOY
NO!

The Little Boy grabs Daredevil’s arm.

LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
Don’t hurt my Dad!

Daredevil stops. A BEAT. And then he lets the Father drop
to the ground. The Little Boy holds his Father, SOBBING, as
Daredevil stands there, unsure.

DAREDEVIL
I’m not the bad guy, kid...

But it’s more of a plea than a statement. Daredevil turns
and slips out of the dark room as we

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Where Matt stands overlooking the city. His hood pulled back
from his face. Looking sick of the life that he’s created.

Their offices are right in between a yellow “CHECKS CASHED”

CUT TO:
INT. NELSON & MURDOCK - SAME
As we meet their secretary/receptionist KAREN PAGE. She's a
beautiful, wholesome~looking blond who has a thing for Matt,
which we can sense from the moment he steps in.
KAREN
Hi, Matt. You got some messages. I
typed them into your braille printer.

MATT
Thanks, Karen.

Foggy steps out of his office as Karen hands Matt a fancy
gold-embossed invitation.

KAREN
And this came by messenger this morning.
It‘s your invitation to the Black and
White Ball at the Grand. Plus one.
She smiles, clearly wanting to be asked.

FOGGY
Plus one? Sweet.

Foggy snatches the invitation as Karen glares.

KAREN
Would you like some coffee?

MATT
I’m fine, thanks.

Matt walks into his office. Foggy holds up his empty cup.

FOGGY
I'd like coffee.

Karen just walks back to her desk.

O-kay...

INT. MATT’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is crowded with junk--remote control sailboats,
leisure suits, boxes of shoes, all from the pro bono cases of
the past. Matt steps in and hits a button on a BRAILLE
PRINTER as his COURT TRANSCRIPTS begin printing out.

FOGGY
(reading the invite)
How'd you rate? This is the toughest
ticket in town.

MATT
I don’t know. What'd you find on our
mystery man?

FOGGY
Mark Welch? Nothing. No records. No
priors. That phone number is a
disconnect. It’s like he never existed.
Now about this party tonight--

MATT
I’m not going.

FOGGY
What? Are you crazy? That place will be
crawling with rich people. The kind of
people who don’t pay their fees in fish.

MATT
Then you go.

FOGGY
I‘ma Plus One. Plus Ones can’t get into
anything by themselves.
(stops)
This is about Elektra, isn’t it?

MATT
No.

FOGGY
That‘s it. Natchios owns the Grand.
She's the one who invited you. This is
getting serious, isn’t it?

(CONTINUED)

MATT
Not exactly. I blew it last night.

FOGGY
What happened?

Foggy picks up a Nerf basketball from Matt’s desk.

MATT
It‘s hard to explain...

Foggy shoots but hits the rim.

FOGGY
Karen said it was messengered this
Morning. So at least one of you isn’t
giving up so easily. Ball.

Foggy tosses him the Nerf ball. Matt throws a perfect SWISH.

MATT
I don't wanna talk about it.

FOGGY
Right. God forbid you share anything
personal with your best friend.

Foggy shoots again, this time missing completely.

FOGGY (CONT'D)
Swish.

Matt smirks.

FOGGY (CONT’D)
Look, can I speak to you as your friend
for a second and not as a whore monger?

MATT
Only if it’s for a second.

FOGGY
That whole love-at-first-sight thing?
Never happened to me. I always thought
it was some crap Hallmark invented to
push product on Valentine’s Day. Until I
saw you two in that coffee shop. Ball.

Matt catches the Nerf ball as he thinks that over.
MATT
Plus One, huh?

INT. GRAND HOTEL BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING

A luxurious old-time hotel along the lines of the St. Regis
or the Plaza. Matt and Foggy make their way through.

FOGGY
Do you know how much money is here
tonight? One new client and we could be
set for a year.
Matt suddenly catches a WHIFF OF CIGARETTE SMOKE as:

URICH (0.S.)
Matt Murdock?

NEW ANGLE
to reveal Ben Urich stepping over. Matt tenses.

URICH (CONT'D)
Ben Urich with the Post.

They shake hands.

MATT
This is my partner Franklin Nelson.

FOGGY
That's “N-e-l-s-o-n.”

MATT
You were at the Cordoza trial.

URICH
That's right.

MATT
You're covering it for the paper?

URICH
No. Not really. Curious, that’s all.

Urich offers them his business card.
URICH (CONT’D)

Here's my number. Give me a call if
anything comes up.

But as he does he accidentally knocks Matt’s RED CANE out of

his hands.

It hits the floor with a CLATTER.

URICH (CONT’D)
Sorry.

Urich picks it back up, noticing...

URICH (CONT’D)
Interesting color.

Matt quickly takes it away.

MATT
I wouldn’t know.

But then Matt stops as he hears the sound of a heavy BASS
HEARTBEAT approaching. A HUGE SHADOW falls over them as:

NEW ANGLE

FISK (0.S.)
I didn’t expect to see you here,
Mr. Urich.

to reveal Wilson Fisk. Wesley is at his side, as always.

FISK (CONT'D)
Not relegated to covering the society
pages I hope?

URICH
Comped some tickets from my publisher.
Thought I‘d get a word in with Natchios.

FISK
Still chasing the boogie man?

URICH
Something like that.

Fisk offers his hand to Matt.

FISK
Wilson Fisk.

They shake, Matt's hand is swallowed up in his.

MATT
Matt Murdock. I’ve heard a lot about
you, Mr. Fisk.

(CONTINUED)

PISK
Hopefully not from Mr. Urich here.

Foggy hands Fisk his card.
FOGGY
Franklin Nelson. Nelson and Murdock.
That’s our card. You can keep it.

FISK
Wonderful.

MATT
You used to promote fights at the Garden,
didn’t you, Mr. Fisk?

FISK
That was a long time ago. You're a
boxing fan, Matt?

MATT
My father was a fighter. Jack Murdock.

Fisk stops. Smiles.
FISK
I remember your father. He was a solid
heavyweight. Whatever happened to him?

MATT
Fight game didn’t agree with him.

FISK
It can be a brutal business.

MATT
Yes it can.

Fisk pats Matt on the shoulder.

FISK
Nice meeting you, gentlemen.

He walks off with Urich in his wake.

URICH
Mr. Fisk one more thing...

Foggy gives a low whistle as he watches him go.

FOGGY
Wow. Talk about a side of beef.
(noticing)
Hey, you okay?
Matt shakes it off.

MATT
Yeah. Fine.

Foggy suddenly stops as he sees...
ELEKTRA
walking their way. She looks absolutely breath-taking.

FOGGY
Oh wow.

The crowd parts for her like the Red Sea.
FOGGY (CONT’D)
If I could give you my eyes for one
night, buddy, it’d be tonight.

MATT
Like that, huh?
FOGGY
Like that. I’m gonna be at the bar if
you need me.
(stops) .
You don’t think it’s a cash bar, do you?

MATT
Go.

Foggy slips through the crowd as Elektra steps over.

ELEKTRA
You look fantastic.

MATT
Then I'm a reflection of you.

She smiles.

ELEKTRA
Now that line actually does work.

MATT
I'm sorry about last night.

ELEKTRA
It’s okay.

She sees him struggling, takes his hands in hers.
ELEKTRA
You're here now. That’s all that
matters.
They smile at each other.
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)

Come on. I’ve got someone that I want
you to meet...

FOGGY
at the bar as the band suddenly changes to a SALSA number.
FOGGY
(smiling)
Oh yeah. And Matt said those dance
lessons would never pay off.

He glances over to a circle of South African Diplomates and
winks at a seven-foot-tall BLACK GODDESS.

FOGGY (CONT'D)
Hell-o...

NIKOLAS NATCHIOS

A distinguished Greek businessman. He's greeting a series of
VIP’S from around the world, all here to kiss his ring. He
lights up at the sight of his daughter.

NATCHIOS
Elektra...

ELEKTRA
How are you doing, Dad?

NATCHIOS

Murdock.

Natchios' smile fades as Matt holds out his hand.

MATT
It's a pleasure, sir.

NATCHIOS

It's rare when my daughter introduces me
to one of her “friends.”

ELEKTRA
Dad...
NATCHIOS
What do you do for a living?
ELEKTRA
Dag.
MATT

It‘s okay, Elektra. I don‘t mind.
(to Natchios)
I'm a professional gold digger, sir.

Natchios freezes.

MATT (CONT'D)
It's my intention to make your daughter
fall in love with me, ingratiate myself
to you, and eventually walk away with
millions of your family’s money.

Stunned silence.
MATT (CONT'D)
And may I add that you look fantastic
this evening, sir.

Natchios bursts out LAUGHING. Elektra watches in amazement
as her father takes Matt and claps him on the back.

NATCHIOS
Very good! Very good indeed! Can I have
someone bring you something to eat, Matt?

MATT
I’m fine, thanks.

Elektra is floored.

ELEKTRA
Oh my God, he offered you food. I’ve
never~--he’s never done that before...

MATT
Let’s dance.

THE DANCE FLOOR

As Foggy slow dances with the beautiful amazon. It’s obvious
she doesn’t understand a word that he’s saying:

FOGGY
Did you hear about that new sushi place
that caters just to lawyers?
(beat)
It's called SOSUMI!

He cracks himself up. The woman just stares.
FOGGY (CONT'D)
Sosumi! So-sue-me, it’s a...so you're

BASS HEARTBEAT of Wilson Fisk in the distance.

MATT
How does your father know Wilson Fisk?

ELEKTRA
They used to be business partners a long
time ago. Why?

MATT
No reason. Just curious.

FISK & NATCHIOS

They sip champagne as they glance over to see Matt and
Elektra dancing together.

FISK
She looks so happy...
NATCHIOS
Yes.
FISK

I haven't seen her smile like that
since before the tragedy.

Natchios stops as Fisk whispers:

FISK (CONT’D)
Poor girl. Right in front of her eyes...

NATCHIOS
Why must you bring that up?

FISK
History has a way of repeating itself.

And then Fisk takes the red rose from his jacket and slips it
into Natchios’ lapel. Natchios goes pale.

NATCHIOS
W-What are you saying?

FISK
Just saying good-bye, old friend.

Fisk pats the rose.

What’s wrong with this headline, Urich?
It says New York Times! I let you chase
boogie men for six months and when they
actually turn out to be real you get
scooped by the Times?

URICH
I was waiting for the facts. There’s no
real proof that Natchios was the Kingpin

Where we see Matt sitting at the table, reading the braille
newspaper version of The New York Times. We hear a loud
POUNDING on the door.

FOGGY (0.S.)
Matt? You home?

He POUNDS some more. Matt finally gets up and opens the door
to reveal Foggy, breathless.

FOGGY (CONT’D)
I heard. It’s all over the news.
How is she doing?

MATT
I can’t get to her.

He stops when he notices the cuts on Matt‘s face.

FOGGY (CONT’D)
What happened to you?

Ran into a door.

Matt turns back inside as Foggy reacts.

FOGGY
How many times?

Matt sits back at the table. Foggy sits across from him.

FOGGY (CONT'D)
Guess what I found out?
(beat)
There is no Mark Welch.

MATT
Then you were right. It’s a dead end.

Foggy takes out the piece of paper that Matt used in Lisa
Tazio’s apartment. MARK WELCH 6301000.

| FOGGY
It‘s not a name. It’s a hotel. Someone
named Welch was at The Mark. And that
phone number wasn’t a phone number...

Foggy puts a SLASH on the 630 and TWO DOTS onto the 1000.
Changing what looked like a phone number into: 6/30 10:00.

FOGGY (CONT'D)
She didn't press hard enough for us to
read it. Lisa Tazio was meeting somebody
named Welch at ten o’clock at The Mark.
June 30th. The night she was murdered.

MATT
It doesn’t prove anything.

Matt gets up and walks into the kitchen. He pours from a
specialized coffee maker for the blind (timed braille
buttons, burn protection) and pours himself a cup.

Matt shakes his head.

MATT

I'm sorry. You're on your own today.
FOGGY

MATT

The funeral is this morning. It’s the
only way I can get to Elektra..

FOGGY
I can’t do this by myself...

MATT
You're a better lawyer than I am. You
just have to believe it for yourself.

FOGGY
Iwill. But not today. Now come on.
Put on your lawyer clothes and let’s go.
Matt doesn’t move. A LONG BEAT. Foggy scowls.

WESLEY

FISK .
Better to appear loyal to a friend than
open-minded to his slander. Especially

Bullseye scowls.

BULLSEYE
He made me miss.

Fisk smiles as he holds up an olive for his drink.

FISK
Too much pride can kill a man.

Fisk drops the olive just as Bullseye whips the sharpened
pencil through the air--SPEARING it against the wall.

Tell your boys to stay out of Hell’s

profusely through his coat, winging it:

FOGGY

Cordoza is up on the witness stand.

CORDOZA
Man, I was so wasted...it’s kind of hard
to remember everything...

FOGGY .
But you remember where you were until ten

CORDOZA
Yeah. Sure. Where was I again?

The Prosecution smiles while the Judge rolls her eyes.

FOGGY
(checking his notes)
Um...where is--here--you said you were in
Chumley’s Bar until ten-fifteen. And
then you went to meet a friend--

CORDOZA
That’s right. Turk. I was going to meet
Turk. Cause he owed me some money.

FOGGY
That's right. And you talked to Turk
outside of his apartment at 33rd, a block
from Lisa Tazio’s apartment. There you
passed out from drinking, correct?

CORDOZA
Right. No wait. I just remembered--

Cordoza to finish answering.

JUDGE
Sustained. Continue, Mr. Cordoza.

Foggy wipes his perspiring forehead.

CORDOZA
Turk didn't have my money but he did have
a couple blunts. We got stoned and then
he went inside to get something to eat.

FOGGY
Terrific and then you passed out.

CORDOZA
Yeah. I woke up with this gun in my hand
and cops everywhere.
FOGGY

So he was unconscious during the time of

the shooting. Thank you, Mr. Cordoza.
I have no further questions.

As the rain continues to fall. We see Elektra dressed all in
black as she will be from now on in our story; as if in
perpetual mourning. She watches as the casket is lowered
into the ground beside her mother’s tomb. But she doesn’t
cry. Her eyes are cold and dead. She turns for the limo.

MATT
Elektra...

NEW ANGLE

To reveal Matt standing before her. Stavros starts for him
but Elektra waves him away.

ELEKTRA
It’s okay.

Matt steps over and holds her in his arms.

MATT
I've been trying to reach you.

ELEKTRA
It's better this way...

MATT
You don’t have to go through this alone.

ELEKTRA
Stay away, Matt. Please.

MATT
I can’t do that.

ELEKTRA
I feel like I’m going crazy. Like I’m

I know who it is! Why are you following

Matt stops as realizes he was way off.

URICH (CONT'D)

Kingpin. Pulitzer Prize stuff. Or at
least it was until the New York Times
published theirs first.

MATT
You lost me...

URICH
I had a Deep Throat source.
(beat)
Named Lisa Tazio.

MATT
Tazio had access to the Kingpin?

URICH
One of the Kingpin’s men, I think.
Pillow talk in a hotel room. She sold

random doesn't sit well with me.

Elektra than we've seen before.

She’s a warrior now.

Black leather body suit. Sais strapped on each leg. Leather
wraps lace up her arms, dangling in the breeze. Her hair and
her eyes are black and wild as midnight.

ELEKTRA
I’m looking for Daredevil.

The punks look to each other and start laughing.

We hear a RUSTLING coming from the darkness. And as
Daredevil steps closer to investigate we go to...

closer until--FLAP FLAP FLAP FLAP!

PIGEONS
FLY INTO CAMERA, beating their wings in our face!

To reveal the dress is empty, hung by clothespins in the
shape of a woman. Daredevil tries to get his bearings as--

WHAM!

He’s KICKED in the back of the head by a BLACK LEATHER BOOT!
Daredevil hits the ground hard before looking up to see...

ELEKTRA
standing over him, seething! The cry for help was a trap.

ELEKTRA
Remember me, murderer?

She TRIPLE-KICKS to the BALLS, STOMACH, and FACE! Daredevil
struggles back to his feet as Elektra circles around him...

ELEKTRA (cont ‘d)
It’s your turn to bleed.

She delivers a series of RAPID FIRE KICKS AND STRIKES that
drive Daredevil back across the rooftop. But then she throws
a kick to his head which Daredevil catches in an ANKLE~LOCK.

DAREDEVIL
I didn’t kill your father.

ELEKTRA

She JUMPS UP with the other foot and KICKS Daredevil across

the face! He stumbles back as she whips out her sai and
expertly TWIRLS it in her hands.

Elektra whips the other sai up into his face but Daredevil
deflects the blade and GRABS HER in an ELBOW LOCK.

NEW ANGLE

He wraps his other arm around her throat, pulling her against
his chest. He whispers pleadingly:

DAREDEVIL (CONT'D)
I'm not going to fight you.

And in this moment we realize--that they're in the same exact
position they were in that day in the park. When Elektra
said she'd never fall for the same attack twice.
ELEKTRA
Good. Then this will be quick.
She suddenly WHIPS her sai out and THRUSTS it into his chest!
He CRIES OUT as he drops to his knees, blood pouring out as
Elektra pounces on him with her sai against his throat!
ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
Now I want to look into the eyes of my
father’s killer as he dies.
She PULLS BACK HIS HOOD. And then she freezes as she sees.

ELEKTRA
He's going to pay for what he did.

MATT

Don’t...don’t go...

Elektra bends down and kisses Matt on the lips. It’s a
hungry kiss of passion and pain and remorse...

ELEKTRA
I'm sorry, my love.

Daredevil passes out from the blood loss. Elektra gently
pulls his hood back down over his face.

As he steps off of the fire escape and onto the roof. He
smiles as Elektra unsheathes her sai.

ELEKTRA (CONT’D)
Murderer...

BULLSEYE
Yeah. But you gotta admit that was
one helluva toss.

Elektra LEAPS for Bullseye, KICKING him across the face while
SLASHING at him with her sais!

BULLSEYE

dodges the sword strikes as the blades send SPARKS FLYING

Dropping her sai as she falls to her knees--holding her hand
against her neck to stop the bleeding.

BULLSEYE (cont’d)
You're good, baby. I'11 give you that.

She reaches for her sai but Bullseye KICKS IT UP into his own
hand and smiles.

BULLSEYE (cont’d)
But I’m magic.

Elektra tears the sash from her arm and ties it around her
neck like a tourniquet, still game to fight.

ON DAREDEVIL
as his eyes flutter open in time to see...

BULLSEYE (CONT'D)
And for my next trick...

BULLSEYE
Swinging the sai UP INTO ELERTRA'S STOMACH!
DAREDEVIL
NO!
ON ELEKTRA

as the blade POKES OUT of her back in silhouette! Bullseye
slides the blade out as she crumples to her knees.

A POLICE HELICOPTER
Flies overhead, ILLUMINATING THEM in the passing flash of the

spotlight. Bullseye SCOWLS and slips into the darkness of
the rooftops and chimneys, leaving them to die together.

ON ELEKTRA

As she stumbles towards Daredevil...leaving a trail of blood
behind her...until she falls into his arms...

DAREDEVIL (cont ‘d)
No... .

Her eyes flutter as she slowly reaches up and touches his
cheek. Blood flowing from her mouth. He touches her face.
Just like he did that day in the rain. A million years ago.

DAREDEVIL (CONT'D)

Please...

ELEKTRA
Shhh...

DAREDEVIL
Oh God...

ELEKTRA

Thank you, Matt...
A little smile as the light leaves her eyes...

ELEKTRA (CONT'D)
..-for helping me see.

And with that she collapses in his arms.
NEW ANGLE

As we see the POLICE coming up the steps. Daredevil can’t
stay any longer. He kisses her one last time.

NEW ANGLE

As the door on the roof BURSTS OPEN to reveal Detective
Manolis and his men, armed with guns at the ready.

MANOLIS
HOLD IT!

But Daredevil is already gone.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

The SEARCHLIGHT from a POLICE HELICOPTER passes over the old
church, revealing a FIGURE draped over the crufix...

DAREDEVIL.

We're back to the beginning of our story.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
As we see Bullseye crouched down, smiling at what he’s found.

A BLOOD TRAIL.

INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

As Father Everett pulls off Daredevil’s cowl. He reacts to
the dead eyes of the man before him.

FATHER EVERETT
You. You’re the vigilante...

MATT
(grimacing)
I’m not much of anything...

The Priest takes the purple cloth from his neck and uses it
to stop the bleeding.

FATHER EVERETT
God has infinite mercy, my son. All you
have to do is ask...

MATT
Everything's been taken from me, and now
I’m supposed to ask for mercy?
(beat)
I don't ask for mercy. People ask me.

BULLSEYE (0.S.)
Good line. Can I use it?

as Bullseye steps through the front door.

BULLSEYE (CONT‘D)
You leave one helluva blood trail.
A blind man could follow it.

DAREDEVIL
(to the Priest)
Is there a back way out?

FATHER EVERETT
Yes.

DAREDEVIL
Take it. Now.

FATHER EVERETT
What about you?

DAREDEVIL
I have to finish this.

FATHER EVERETT
You can‘t fight like this.

DAREDEVIL
Have faith. Isn’t that right, Father?

Father Everett says a silent prayer before he turns and
hurries out. Until it’s just Daredevil and Bullseye.

BULLSEYE
Bring it on.

And in that split second Daredevil WHIPS his billy club out
across the church-~SMASHING Bullseye‘s mouth!

BULLSEYE (cont‘d)
Motherf--

ON BULLSEYE

as he spits a mouthful of teeth into his hand! And then he
WHIPS his teeth back at Daredevil STRIKING HIM in his eyes!

ON BULLSEYE
as he kicks the billy club up into his hand and CRACKS the
grappling hook into Daredevil’s chest wound. Daredevil
grimaces as he drops to his knees from the pain...
BULLSEYE (cont’d)
This is my favorite part. Where I get to
choose how you die.

We hear the BELLS up in the tower as they automatically begin
to ring on the hour. Bullseye gets an idea and smiles.

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. CHURCH - SAME

As police cars pull up outside. Manolis steps out. He looks
up to the BELL TOWER in the moonlight as we...

CUT TO:

INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT

As Daredevil drops to his knees in pain; the CLANGING SOUND
is like knives driving into his hyper-sensitive ears.

BULLSEYE
What’s with you?

DAREDEVIL'S POV

as even the shadow world he sees is disappearing. Until all
that’s left is infinite blackness.

CUT TO:
MANOLIS
Shouting over to his men as they take position:
MANOLIS
I don’t care if it’s a church! Break the
Goddamned door down if you have to!

MANOLIS (CONT'D)
(to his other men)
Keep him in your sites!

SHARPSHOOTER
Which one?

MANOLIS
Both of them!

NEW ANGLE

As Ben Urich’s car pulls up. He jumps out and freezes at
what he sees.

URICH
Matt...

BACK TO:
BULLSEYE
Laughing as he holds a SAI up, glistening in the moonlight.

BULLSEYE
It’s hers. Seems fitting, doesn’t it?

But then the BELLS RING for the last time as we go to...
DAREDEVIL’S POV
Coming back from his shattered senses...
CU DAREDEVIL’S HAND
as he clenches his fist and...
WHAM!
PUNCHES his way out of the darkness! We hear the CRACK of
Bullseye’s jaw--like the sound of a bottle breaking--as it
hangs open unhinged!
ON DAREDEVIL
as he WHIRLS around and GRABS Bullseye, shoving him out the
window of the tower. Holding him out by the neck. Bullseye
spits out words through broken teeth:
BULLSEYE

You can't do it, can you Devil? That's

what separates me and you. You’re soft.

You'll try to have me arrested. Maybe

I‘1l even go to jail again. For a little
while. But Fisk will get me out.

(CONTINUED)
98.
CONTINUED:

Daredevil goes cold as he realizes:

DAREDEVIL
Fisk is the Kingpin...
Bullseye laughs and nods.
BULLSEYE
Owns the whole Goddamn town. I’11 get
his lawyers. And his judges. And I’ll
walk out the door.
(spitting blood)
And I‘1]1 kill again. And again. And
that blood will be on your hands then.

A LONG BEAT.

DAREDEVIL
You'll kill no one...

ON BULLSEYE
as he begins to realize...

DAREDEVIL (CONT'D)
Ever again.

We watch his horrified face as he DROPS all the way down to
the street below with a sickening THUD!

THE POLICE

approach the body with their guns drawn, taking no chances.
But Bullseye isn't getting up.

cut TO:
THE POLICE
Running up the steps to the bell tower to find--he’s gone.
cut TO:
URICH
As he steps over to Manolis.

DET. MANOLIS
What do you want?

URICH
I've got a gift for you.

{CONTINUED)
99.
CONTINUED:

DET. MANOLIS
The hell are you talking about?

URICH
The collar of a lifetime.

Manolis looks him over, suspicious.

DET. MANOLIS
Why me?

URICH
It kills me to admit this, Nick, but
you're the only honest cop I know...

Off his reaction we

EXT. FISK INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

As we see the glorious Fisk building all lit up. It’s empty--
except for one LARGE SILHOUETTE on the top floor. And then:

WOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!

The power is turned off one floor at a time. Until the
entire building is shrouded in darkness.

CUT TO:
INT. FISK INDUSTRIES -NIGHT
As we see Wilson Fisk standing in the darkness. The lights
of the city behind him. We hear the GROAN of heavy metal
doors opening as he turns to see the shadow of a devil.
The two stare each other down for a LONG BEAT.
FISK'S CANE
tightens in his grip...
DAREDEVIL'S BILLY CLUB
slides out of his holster...

. DAREDEVIL
Kingpin.
Fisk smiles. Nods.

(CONTINUED)
100.

FISK
Yes.

As Daredevil looms...

DAREDEVIL
Time to give the devil his due.

Daredevil SHOOTS his billy club across the room! But Fisk is
fast for such a big man and he WRAPS the club around his
cane, YANKING Daredevil off of his feet!

NEW ANGLE

As they COLLIDE like two mighty bulls! Brute, massive
strength against speed and agility!

The STORM RAGES outside as the fight intensifies! Fisk picks
up a barbell and THROWS IT at Daredevil! It CRASHES INTO the
wall as DD barely ducks underneath!

ON DAREDEVIL

as he jumps onto Fisk, CHOKING HIM OUT. But Fisk is too
strong. He FLIPS Daredevil over his head and brutally
SMASHES him onto the ground. Broken and bloodied.
DAREDEVIL’S POV

His senses a mess. As helpless as any other blind man.

ON FISK

He pulls a red rose off of a vase on the table. He smells it
through his bloody nose and grins. :

FISK
Time to say good-bye.

Fisk DROPS THE ROSE onto Daredevil’s body.
FISK (CONT’D)
I always thought the rose was a nice
touch...
ON DAREDEVIL
He closes his fist around the rose as he realizes.

DAREDEVIL
Fallon...

(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED: (2)

FISK

You’ve done your homework. Fallon was an

early employer of mine. Some didn’t like

to give the death blow. But I could kill

aman just as soon as look at him.
We hear the THUNDER outside and the sound of the RAIN
INCREASING. Daredevil turns towards the sound of the
storm...and we remember what he once said about the rain...

FISK (CONT'D)
See you in hell.

The Kingpin raises his heavy cane over his head as Daredevil
summons his last ounce of strength and THROWS HIS BILLY CLUB
up to the ceiling. He misses Fisk but strikes...

A SPRINKLER HEAD.

The sprinkler SPRAYS WATER down into the office as Fisk looks
up, confused.

DAREDEVIL'S POV

As the beads of water bounce down off of Fisk's massive body,
showing him now in perfect silhouette. Just like Elektra in
the rain that day in the park.

ON FISK

As he swings down with his cane--but Daredevil rolls out of
the way just in time! Fisk GROWLS and swings again.

But now Daredevil can hear the SPLASHING of his footsteps.
The SWOOSH of his heavy fists through the rain.

Fisk struggles to regain his balance as Daredevil slides
through his legs and SCISSOR-KICKS his legs!

CRACK! CRACK!
The mighty Kingpin falls, crippled at the knees!

FISK
AAAHH!

NEW ANGLE

As both men lie battered on the floor. A BEAT. And then
Daredevil struggles to his feet. He eyes Fisk’s heavy cane.

FISK (CONT'D)
Go on.

(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED :

Daredevil picks up the cane.

FISK (CONT‘D)
Do it.

Daredevil raises the solid crystal setting high in the air.
The death blow. Fisk smiles through cracked, bloody lips.

| FISK (CONT’D)
You see? We're the same, you and I.

Daredevil stops. A LONG BEAT as Fisk’s words hang in the
air. He drops the cane to the floor as Fisk’s smile fades.

DAREDEVIL
No.

We hear the SHOUTS OF THE POLICE, running up the steps. But
before they get there the door swings open revealing--

BEN URICH.
He looks to Daredevil...
URICH
You'd better go. I'11 watch him ‘til
the cops arrive.

DAREDEVIL
Why should I trust you?

URICH
Because I know the truth...

Daredevil stops.

URICH (CONT'D)
Justice is blind.

Off Daredevil’s reaction we
SMASH CUT TO:
THE POLICE
BARGING into the office to see...
FISK

on his knees in a pool of bloody water. Urich leans against
the desk calmly smoking a cigarette as Manolis steps in.

(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:

URICH
Nothing to see here, Nick.

Manolis smirks. Fisk glowers from the floor.

FISK
You've got nothing on me!

URICH
Funny thing about nothing. It usually
turns out to be something.
And then Manolis calls to his men:

MANOLIS
BRING HIM IN!

Fisk stares in disbelief as we see...
WESLEY

Being led into the room in handcuffs. He points his locked
hands at his bloodied boss.

WESLEY
That's him. The Kingpin.

Urich smiles. Even Manolis cracks a grin.
MANOLIS

Somebody see if they can fit a pair of
cuffs on this tub of shit.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

ON DAREDEVIL

As he opens the palm of his hand to reveal...

THE ROSE.

He lets it drop. And with it, the pain of the past.

DAREDEVIL
This one’s for you, Dad.

The rose strikes the sidewalk in SLOW-MOTION as we
FADE OUT.

FADE IN:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
CLOSE-UP NEWSPAPER

The headline screams in the typical Post style: THE REAL
KINGPIN? And below that: DAREDEVIL STRIKES BACK! -

NEW ANGLE
Where we see Matt and Foggy having a cup of coffee.

FOGGY
(reading)
*...police say that although there was no
eyewitnesses, they suspect Daredevil was
the one to bring Fisk to justice.’

MATT
See? No eyewitnesses.

FOGGY
Don’t tell me you’re still a skeptic?

MATT
Even Bigfoot has eyewitnesses.

FOGGY
Aw come on...

Matt laughs. And then:

MATT
Hey...

Foggy glances up.

MATT (CONT'D)
You did it. You got Cordoza off.

FOGGY “
Yeah. I just wish I knew what happened.
Urich won't tell me anything and neither
will the police. I just hope this Welch
guy gets what's coming to him.

Matt smiles.

MATT
He will...
