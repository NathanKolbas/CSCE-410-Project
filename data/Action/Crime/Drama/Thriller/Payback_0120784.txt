FADE IN:
EXT. CITYGATE SRIDGE - DAY
A cool, fall day in the city translates to freezing on the
C-G-B. Cars rumble and roar in pummeling, uninterrupted
streams. The wind howls, but the bridge defies it all.
So does the lone man walking across. PARKER. His own
solidity and tension matching thatSof tHe bridge. One
tough sonofabitch. Angry; coo. .
His worn, unpressed gray suit coat flutters behind him.
Arms swing easy as he walks. Headed to the city. A bridge
away from completing a journey back from the dead.

Piece of apple pie, then downs the last cf a cup of black
coffee. The COUNTER GIRL steps forward to refill it.

Parker covers the cup with a hand. No thanks. She can see
he's a bastard, but maybe that's what she likes about him.

Can I get you anything else?

Parker looks to an open pack of Marlboros by the register.

INT. FIRST BANK BRANCH - DOWNTOWN - DAY

Parker slides his license and VISA card in to a TELLER.
The license is beat-up, but not ridiculously so. Anyhow,
she only compares the two cards together, not to Parker.

As she punches a computer keyboard, Parker looks about the
bank. The security cameras, the door to the vault, the
height of the Flexiglas wall, the guard half-dozing by the
door. We can see him think about it for a seceond.

 

   

The moment is broken as the teller smiles up ac him.

TELLER
Mr. Johnson, I'll need the last
four digits of your social
security number.

Letting his thoughts die, he# answers without hesitation.

Parker looks through the glass counter at a row of
handguns. There are two beefy looking .44 Magnum REVOLVERS
both marked $500. He taps his finger on the glass.

PARKER
Let me see these.

  
  

The broker unlocks “Case, sets the guns cn the counter.
Parker picks up the first, feels the weight in his hand.
Then he checks the action, slaps the cylinder open and
shut. Finally, he shakes his head. No good.

The Waiter starts to say he won't, but the look Parker

In no hurry, Parker wipes his mouth with his napkin, stands
and then strolls right out of the restauranc.

CUT TO:

EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

The street deserted. Then a burning coal, a puff of smoke
rise from the shadowed entrance to a walk-down apartment.
Parker is here. He's watching the building across the way.

 

A taxi pulls up and a girl gets out. LYNN. Looks a little
drunk as she heads toward the building Parker watches.

INT. HALLWAY - BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Lynn comes off the stairs walks down to the door to her

.apartment. She unlocks it, steps inside.

As the door starts to close, Parker comes off the stairs
after her. He's got the gun in his hand.

Oblivious, Lynn clicks the door shut. She takes hold of

She gets a good tight grip on the coffee pot.

KITCHEN

Turning, Lynn flings the pot at Parker. He just ducks
under it as: hot coffee and glass explode against the wall.

Lynn grabs a steel knife sharpening rod and continues the
attack. The first shot catches Parker in a blocking
forearm. As he catches hold of her, the second shot
glances off the side of his head.

Parker staggers. She comes after him, whacks him across
the back. Finally, he ties her up. As she struggles:

LYNN
You got a lot of nerve coming
here high and mighty! Did you
bring your whore with you? Did
‘ you?!

She gets an arm free, starts slapping him. He finally
slams her up against the wail, hands just beneath her
throat. She settles a bit, starts to cry.

LYNN
I'm glad you're not dead. Isn't
that stupid?

Parker reaches into a pocket, pulis ouc a dog-eared

INT. iLYNN'S BSEDROOM - Ni

Lynn enters in front sf Parker. She watches as he tears
the phone cord from the wi . ie goes to the dresser where
a cell phone rests. He picks i= up, smashes it to pieces.

  

Then he starts going through drawers, the closet. She just
watches. Finaiity, he goes back to a WOODEN BOX on the
dresser. Opens it to reveal a tourniquet, syringe, spoon,
candle and HEROIN.

PARKER
Cold turkey, Lynn. You're
cleaning up.

She leaps forward, tries to take it away. Parker shoves
her back on the bed.
PARKER
Now, save me the trouble of
tearing the room apart.

She knows exactly what he means. She stands, points back
where she was just sitting. Parker reaches under the
Mattress, pulls out a CHROME .38.

She looks at the gun, back to him. There's something
significant about this gun. :

Said with disgust in her and himself. Parker strides out.

Parker closes the door. Tipping over a bookcase, he wedges
it between the door and the yy locking her in.

doorway, knows she's dead.

Finally he steps over, turns her head toward him. Her eyes
are open in death. He wipes them shut with his hand.
Parker slowly twists off his wedding ring. He pulls the
syringe from her arm, pins the ring to the wall with it.
Then he moves around the bed, lies down beside her.

Hands behind his head, he stares at the ceiling. As he
remembers, it starts with a phone ringing, voices.

INT. DARKENED SEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO:

It's Lynn's bedroom, but she way it used to look. Back in
the old days, when she cared how it looked, when she wasn't
on the junk. Wearing just jockey shorts, Parker hangs up
the phone, stands there thinking.

Lynn, moonlit in bed, sleepy but gorgeous, looks to
Parker's back. No bullet scars there...yet.

LYNN
So? What did Val want?

PARKER
He's got a line ona job.

LYNN
You're thinking about it or you
wouldn't have gotten cut of bed.

PARKER
He wants to buy his way back

coward. Needs to be around
other cowards. He can't hack it
as an independenc.

 

LYNN
Stop thinking about Val. Come
over here and think about me.

He looks at her, feels sudden desire like a worm twisting
low in his belly. He stops thinking about Val, doesn't see
the come on.

Parker moves toward the bed. She rises to meet him. As
they fall back on the bed...

As he sets the boltcutters on the courier's handcuff chain,
the bodyguard begins fumbling for his shoulder holster.

Then Val is there. He crabs the bodyguard by the back of
his tattooed neck, begins violently and excessively
slamming his head into the front dash.

Parker cuts the chain.

Parker isn't shy about resting his hand on the revolver
shoved into his belt.

Val pulls a creased PHOTO from a pocket, holds it in front
of Parker's face. It's him, half-dressed, asleep in bed
with a half-naked unidentified WOMAN. (We see it better
this time; the photo Parker showed Lynn.)
: VAL
Lynn did not understand. But
they never do, do they?
Val flicks it at him, rises. Parker's eyes slowly follow.

Val smiles down, kicks him in the head intc...

SIX MEN sitting around a table playing poker. One of them
is a big cop (DET. HICKS), the other a FLORID-FACED MAN who

and radioman steps in. Parker's behind him.

Radioman clutches his ear. Blood runs down the side cf his

A smalier, hard-faced man aiso rises. He sports a badge

LEARY

who likes to resist arrest.

 

   

As the cther men (tough-looking drivers) rise, Parker
reaches into his jacket.

PARKER
You boys don't want to play with
me. I'm a sore loser.

Hicks and Leary exchange a look, are about to draw iron.

PARKER
You Stegman?

Parker tosses the heroin balloons on the table. Stegman
scoops them up, cbviously not something he wants =c share

one of her eyes black. SudgeRly, Val wakes with a start.
He lays there a moment, wipes. & hand across his sweaty

face. The last 24 hours Gigven't been easy for him.

Val sits up on his e ® looks over at Pearl, sighs.
Then he sees somet else, squints into the darkness.

Across the room, a coal burns red, disappears. val
squints. A beat and then the coal burns again.

Someone's sitting there smoking a cigarette!

PARKER'S VCICE
Seventy thousand dollars, val.
That's what you owe me.

 

Val's hand darts to the night table, frantically casts
about on top. He accidentaily switches on a tabletop
stereo. More Dean Martin.

PARKER'S VOICE
Your gun's not there.

Parker switches on a light. Val blinks, cringes like he's
been hit. Parker has Val's 9mm and his own Magnum. i,

Parker stands, starts over. He shoves the 9 milli in his
belt, aims the Magnum. Val nearly jumps out of his skin.

VAL
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Parker.

Pearl stirs, wakes up. As she gasps, Parker registers her
black leather corset, a set cf handcuffs and a cat-o-nine
tails cn her dresser.
PARKER

You're a pro. Keep your mouth

shut, you'll walk out of here.
Pearl nods, actually seems excited by the situation.
Parker looks to Val who's pushed back against the headboard.

VAL
Sure. Coast to coast, it's all
the same.

PARKER
Tell them you gave them money
that wasn't yours. Tell them
you want it back.

VAL ~
Parker, I can't. I --

Parker sets the barrel of the gun, against Val's forehead,
pins him back against the wall.

VAL
You'll kill me whether I get the
money or not.

As Parker cocks back the hammer...

VAL
Okay, I'll get it. I'll get it.
I just need a couple of days.

PARKER
Tomorrow. Noon. Say it.

VAL
It sounds crazy, Parker, but no
hard feelings. I did what I had
to. You gotta appreciate that.

Parker raises the pistol ready to whack Val with it.

PEARL
No... Let me.

Parker lowers the pistol, shrugs.
Before Val can react, Pearl grabs, swings the handcuffs.

One of the steel bracelets catches Val across the side of
the head. He writhes in pain.

Parker steps back out of the w9y! Pearl slips the
bracelets around her fist. sy rts hooking shots into

Parker understands, then returns the favor of the kick Val
once gave him. Val flops over unconscious.

DEAN MARTIN
Ain‘t that a kick in the head!

Pearl watches Parker in open admiration.

PEARL

PARKER

VAL
I'm Val Resnick. I got an
appointment with Mr. Carter.

GRAY
Yes. Turn around please.

Val knows why this is being asked.

VAL
Let me just tell you --

GRAY
Turn around.
Val turns, raises his hands as the man frisks him. He
pulls a 9mm from a shoulder holster, a .38 from a holster
in the small of Val's back, a .22 from an ankle holster.
GRAY
This isn't how Mr. Carter likes
his visitors.
VAL

MR. CARTER looks out a window with a telesccpe. Impressive,
he conjures visions of Wall Street and high finance.

His back is to Val as he enters. Leaving them, Gray closes
the door. Carter continues looking through the telescope.

Val stands there, realizes with a start there's another man
in the room. A formidable looking man a BLACK SUIT
sitting in the far corner. He doesn't notice Val ar all.

 

Phil from the. Cakwood is also here. He stands behind che
bar in the corner. Val smiles, nods to him. Phil smiles
back, but it's unnerving.

CARTER
Look at this, Resnick.

Val steps to the window. The telescope points at a distant
building. Carter steps aside. Val takes a peek.

As Val moves for a chair, he kicks the tripod stand. Not
knocking it over, but certainly losing the dentist's
office. He mumbles an apology, finally gets to his seat.

~ CARTER
Phil, told me you have a problem
you want help with. Is it your
problem who poked a man's eye
out at the Oakwood last night?

VAL
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.

CARTER
There's an old expression which
has always served me well.
Don't shit where you live.

VAL
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter, it's just
that --

Carter's not interested in what Val has to say.

CARTER
There are three ways to handle
this situation. One, we could
help you. Two, we could let you
handle it yourself. Three, we
could have you replaced.

Val can't heip, but glance back at Black. At Phil.

We have an veStment in you,

Phil, a man has come to town to

it appears that iz is our
business after all.

Mr. Carter steps over to the telescope, begins scanning for
the dentist's office. '

CARTER
Where did you get the money?

VAL
A -- a heist. A holdup, Mr.
Carter.

CARTER
And who was held up?

VAL '
A Chinese gang, sir. The Chows.

CARTER
Yes, I know them. And this man
Parker, he was part of the gang
that performed the holdup?

VAL
Yes, sir.

CARTER

CARTER

Do you know your value to the
organization, Resnick? You're a

That comes in handy. But now
you've allowed an area of your

possible danger to us.

 

Gray and Black close in a step.

A man in our organization has to

VAL

Until this matter is settled,
