FADE IN:

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH glass windows. Reflections of the
city, of office workers, of a woman speaking into a
microphone.

ERICA
I'm Erica Bain, and as you know, I
walk the city. I bitch and moan
about it. I walk and watch and
listen. I witness all the beauty
and ugliness that is disappearing
from our beloved city. Last week
took me to the grey depths of the
East River where Dimitri Panchenko
swims his laps like he has since
the 1960s. And today I walked by
the acres of scaffolding outside
what used to be the Plaza Hotel
and I thought about Eloise.
Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?
Eloise who lived in the Plaza
Hotel, with her dog Weenie and her
parents who were always away and
her English nanny who had 8
hairpins made out of bones --

As she talks, we see her -- thin, semi-transperant,
ghostlike. Almost nothing but voice.

ERICA
That Eloise. The adored brat of
my childhood. A little punk kid
pirouetting round the grand
ballroom, pouring pitchers of water
down the mail chute, Upper East Side
anarchist in pigtails, not unlike
other brats and punks this city has
brought to life. Sid Vicious spewing
beer from his teeth in the Chelsea
Hotel. Andy Warhol, his sunglasses
reflecting Valerie Solana's gun.
Edgar Allen Poe freeing live monkeys
from the crates of a crumbling schooner
on oily slips of South Street. Stories
of a city that is disappearing before
our eyes, its people swept over the
Williamsburg, the Holland Tunnel,
the Major Degan.

ERICA (CONT'D)
You can visit, but you can't live
here anymore. So what will be
left of those stories? Are we
going to have to construct an
imaginary city to house our
memories? Because when you love
something, every time a bit of it
goes, you lose a piece of
yourself. So where's Eloise going
to sleep tonight? Can you hear
her ghost wandering round the
collapsing corridors of her
beloved Plaza, trying to find her
nanny's room, calling out to
construction
workers in a voice that nobody
hears, has anyone seen my turtle
Skiperdee?

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - LATER
The end of the show.
ERICA
this is Erica Bain and you
have been listening to 'Street
Walk.'
As the light turns RED --

ERICA
-- see you next week.

-- perfect timing. As usual.
CAROL OLSEN, 50s, very lefty liberal, very Ruth

Hirshburg before she was Ruth Seymour, the director of
the station, enters.

CAROL
Did Eloise really mean that much
to you?

ERICA

Were you never a girl, Carol?

CAROL
Not the kind of girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.
Anyway, good show. Bravo called
again about that TV spot.

CONTINUED:

ERICA
Yeah, I don't know, Carol.

CAROL
Come on, you've got the knack for
it. That post-modern metaphoric
thing of yours is made for them.
And a little cross-promotion
wouldn't hurt NKW.

ERICA
I'm not a face, I'm just a voice.
And my shows are on the website,
people can hear them for free --

CAROL
Yes, exactly.

CLOSE ON ERICA
She shrugs, a bad habit of hers.

ERICA
Maybe.

CAROL
Can I say you're considering?

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL SOLARIUM - LATER

DAVID KARMANI, late 20s, dressed in RN scrubs, attends to
a patient sitting in the solarium.

His face -- thin, dark, beautiful, could be Italian,
Spanish, Black -- an indistinguishable mix, he is like
the future and the past all rolled up in one. A small
CROSS, old, silver, sits on a chain around his neck --
not as a fashion statement, or a fuck you, but a simple,
personal, intimate expression of faith.

A DOCTOR, a woman, all business, comes behind him.

DOCTOR
(irritated)
Could you go to room 512, the
patient thinks his blood pressure
is dropping. Goddamn TV shows,
everyone's a goddamn doctor.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

DAVID
Uh... okay.

He looks her in the eye without attitude, but also
without any sense that she is better than him, or anyone.

It stops her -- for just a moment.
DOCTOR
I am such a god-awful bitch,
sorry.

She leaves.

David shakes his head, moves down the hall -- his PHONE
VIBRATES. He grabs it.

INT. STATIONERY STORE - SAME TIME

Erica, cell phone to her ear, is looking at a mock-up of
a wedding invitation.

ERICA
(into phone)
Hi.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME

DAVID
(smiling)

ERICA
What are you wearing?

DAVID
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck, short sleeve --

ERICA
Uh huh... what about the sexy
green hat?

The SALESWOMAN approaches, more invitations in her hand.
Erica looks at them, nods, than shakes her head, maybe
she doesn't like it.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

STATIONERY WOMAN
(a bit frustrated)
You like it more than the others?
Less than the others? The same?

Erica shrugs, clueless.

ERICA
(into phone)
Honey -- you sure you're okay with

creme and orange?

DAVID
Yeah.

STATIONERY WOMAN
(to Erica)
It's actually not creme, it's
vanilla. But that's fine.

ERICA
(into phone)
It's not creme, it's vanilla --

DAVID
Who cares? Let's just go get
married, tonight.

ERICA
Your mother cares. Trust me. She
wants invitations.

Erica nods at the invitation. "It's fine." And heads
out.

ERICA
Meet me at Nicole's thing later.
Please. I promise you won't have
to talk to anyone but me.
DAVID
Ah... maybe.
EXT. STATIONERY STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Erica starts walking uptown.

ERICA
You're not coming.

David gets to the PATIENT'S ROOM, who is taking his own
pulse.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
DAVID
I'll come to one of your art shows
when you come to one of my
basketball games.
No response.

DAVID
See? Gotta go. I love you.

ERICA
I love you too.
INT. LOFT - DAY

A photography show. Kind of groovy, a tad trendy but

cool. Erica, drink in hand, knows everyone, this is her
crowd --
Erica drifts away, checks out the PHOTOGRAPHS -- a series

of '60s storefronts, a GUN STORE, a LAUNDROMAT, a LIQUOR
STORE.

She SCANS them, taking in every detail, every color,
every corner seeing to the very edges of the frame.
Something JAMES, the GUY who shot them, appreciates.

JAMES
Hi.
He gives Erica a kiss.
ERICA

(off the storefronts)
These are cool.

JAMES
Thanks. The Laundromat is in a
town in Jersey -- where Diane

Arbus used to do her laundry.

That gun store is down in
Chinatown -- Bernice Abott shot it
in the thirties.

ERICA
They are really good. They're
evocative, but quiet. They don't
make a lot of noise. I like them.

JAMES
Thanks. Want to buy one?

She gives him a smile.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ERICA
I wish.

Erica, dragging a bit, sets her full drink down, heads
for the door.

Nicole stops her.

NICOLE
Are you leaving?

ERICA
No, not yet.

NICOLE

You're a shitty liar.

ERICA
I know, but I try.

NICOLE
Well, tell him that sooner or
later he's gonna have to come to
something, he can't avoid us
forever.

At which point she notices something, behind Erica's
shoulder. David, having come straight from his
basketball game.

He puts a finger to his lips. Shhh!!! Then wraps his
arms around Erica, from behind.

DAVID
Don't you love this woman?

NICOLE
I don't know. I could take her or
leave her.

DAVID
You leave her. I'1l take her.

He kisses Erica's neck. She glows with pleasure.

ERICA
Not here.

DAVID
Is it what I'm wearing?

ERICA
No. I love you in sweats.

(CONTINUED)

NICOLE
You're both so happy it's
disgusting.

ERICA
Sorree... see you...

NICOLE
I hate you. Goodbye.

10 EXT. WEST 103RD STREET - DAY 10
David and Erica walking home. The street is quiet,
desolate, shadowed -- and they are happy.

ERICA

That meant a lot to her, you know.

DAVID
My mother told me once, if you
want to love someone, see if you
can love their friends.

ERIC
And?

DAVID
(laughingly)
I hate her.

He puts his arm through hers.

11 EXT. ERICA'S APARTMENT - EVENING 11
They come to their building. Erica sits on the stoop.

ERICA
Sit here a while. It's beautiful.

DAVID
I got to walk him --

ERICA
Get my jacket, then --

He goes into the building. She sits, as UDO JOSAI, 60,
Sudanese woman, a tenant in the building, walks up to the
building, carrying some groceries. Erica moves over to
let her by.

JOSAI
I can open my own door --

Erica moves anyway, gets up to help her get the door.
Josai looks at her, nods, hands Erica an apple from her
bag.

ERICA
Thank you.

David comes back out the door with their dog, Curtis,
passing the woman on their way.

DAVID
That's going to be you when you're
old --
ERICA
I am old. But way meaner.
(then)
She gave me an apple.
Erica takes a bite, as David puts his arm around her.
Just before they leave, Erica wedges a folded newspaper

in the door, props it open so they don't have to take
their keys.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - STRANGERS GATE - NIGHT Al2
There's a magical glow in the sky, darkness has just

begun to gather in the distance as Erica and David take a
walk with Curtis.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT 12
Curtis gets a little frisky, hopping around.

DAVID
He knows I'm carrying.

David reaches behind his back and pulls out the ball.

CURTIS starts BARKING and jumping around excitedly.
Erica unfastens his leash.

David gives the ball a toss. Curtis runs after it.
DAVID
I meant it, you know. What's
wrong with City Hall, tonight?

ERICA
They're closed.

He puts his arms around her.

(CONTINUED)

DAVID
Tomorrow then.

ERICA
You have a family, David. I
don't.

DAVID
You're not marrying my family.

ERICA
Iam. Or kind of hope I hope I
am. Your mother's a sweet woman.
She wants the whole deal.
Invites, a minister, the band
playing. Maybe I want it too.
It's not as if I'm going to do it
twice.

He looks at her. She really means it.
DAVID
I think that's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

He kisses her. They are lost in the moment. Then --

DAVID
Hey, where's Curtis?

They look around, notice for the first time it's gotten
dark.

ERICA
(calling out)
Curtis? Curtis, come here, boy.

The dog doesn't come. David whistles and claps his
hands.

DAVID
Curtis!

But Curtis still doesn't come. He's nowhere to be seen.

ERICA
Where is he?
DAVID
The ball went over there. Come

on.

They leave the path and head out toward the pedestrian
tunnel.
11.
13 EXT. CENTRAL PARK/PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL - NIGHT 13
David walks into a tunnel, Erica behind him.

ERICA
Curtis, where the hell are you?
Come on, we've got to go home.
Curtis!

The dog has vanished into the darkness which now presses
in, sinister.

DAVID
I wish we had a flashlight.

IN BUSHES - MONOCHROMATIC IMAGE - NIGHT

We SEE David and Erica on an unsteady monochromatic
image, realize someone is photographing them through the
bushes. A hand, holding a cell phone, their image on the
screen.

A TALL, thin FIGURE steps into the f.g. --

14 EXT. CENTRAL PARK/PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL - NIGHT 14

The tall thin guy, REED, steps through the bushes holding
Curtis in one arm, his hand clamped over its mouth.

REED
Hey, don't you know there's a
fuckin' leash law?

DAVID
Yeah, sorry. Thanks for finding
him.

Cautiously, David takes a couple steps forward and
reaches out for Curtis. Reed holds on to him.

REED
Isn't there a reward?

DAVID
Yeah, sure -- our gratitude. Now
give him to me.

REED
Gratitude isn't worth much.

David and Erica know this could get dangerous. David
tries to sidestep the problem, gets out his wallet.

(CONTINUED)
12.
14 CONTINUED: 14

DAVID
I don't have much on me, but you
can have it.

Reed grabs his wallet. Curtis tries to get free, Reed
grips him tightly, CURTIS WHINES.

ERICA
You're hurting him!

DAVID
Give me the damn dog right now!

REED
I don't think so. Kind of like
this dog. Think he's a keeper.

BACK TO MONOCHROMATIC IMAGE
Someone is MOVING THROUGH the bushes.

TWO GUYS come out, one of them, CASH, big, fleshy, holds
up a CELL PHONE, photographing the scene. The other,
LEE, holds a metal pipe.

CASH
Smile, baby.

He points the cell phone/camera at Erica.
David moves closer to her.

DAVID
Like I said, I don't have much
cash on me but you guys can have
what I've got...

The three guys close in on them.
LEE
Give me your watch, and give me

that ring, bitch.

Erica pulls off her ring, hands it to him. Lee takes the
ring, then grabs her hand, pulls her to him. David
snaps.

DAVID
Get your hands off her!

As he moves toward Lee, Lee whacks him savagely in the
face with the metal pipe. Erica screams.

Lee continues to beat David already on the ground and

Erica's body laid flat on the pavement. They kick her.

She looks over at David.

FLASHBACK - INT. BEDROOM 20

David's lips meet hers in a kiss. Their lips part. The
moment is strange. His face rises above her, OUT OF
FOCUS. It is as if she can't reach him, is locked in a
bubble, can't move or speak...

INT. ERICA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT) 21
Erica -- thin plastic tubes run from her broken, frail

body, to big, square, pale-colored machines. It's ugly,
survival. Uglier in a way, than even the attack. It is

cold and without passion -- an odd way to hold on to a
life.
INT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 22

David's MOTHER, SISTERS, AUNTS are crowded in the room.
Dark-skinned, emotional, more than a few are praying.

Nicole is there, watching them, wishing like all of us,
she had whatever they have in this moment -- faith,
family, prayer.

A SOCIAL CARE WORKER enters, approaches David's mother,
sisters.

She looks at him.

MERCER
And she would have wanted you to *

The girl says nothing. He tries again.

MERCER
Did he? Did he ever hurt Mommy
before?

No response. She's closed off to the world. He gets up,
as tough a witness as he's ever had.

VITALE gestures down the hall -- A MAN, SONNY MURROW,
decent-looking, well-dressed, sees Mercer and comes
towards them, through the exterior doors. *

MURROW
Come on, honey --

Mercer blocks his path.

MURROW
You do not have the right -- at a

You deal with him. I gotta take a
walk.

Mercer leaves, as Vitale shifts the MAN out of the way.

UPPER HALLWAY 25

Mercer walks down the hall, passes Erica's room, then
turns around, stops, goes back, looks in.

Then he steps into the room, turns to the NURSE, older,
strong, not a lot can shake her.

The Nurse shrugs, then, off Erica's unbearably destroyed
body.

NURSE
I used to listen to her show.

ON Mercer, looking at Erica.

MERCER'S POV

He looks at her with a COP'S eyes. He doesn't miss a
thing. Every bruise, every cut, every blow she took he
sees.

BACK TO SCENE

He barely shakes his head as he walks out the door.

INT. ERICA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 26

ON ERICA: Eyes open, staring straight up. She slowly
moves her neck, taking in the machinery, the tubes, the

She is awake and alone. And it freaks her out -- the

Her fingers feel around the bed frame, find the remote.
She presses it, the TV turns ON.

going to wake up.

Tears are rolling down David's Mother's face.
DAVID'S MOM
You were gone for two weeks. We
had to let him go. We had to --

Erica nods.

ERICA
I... want to see him again...

DAVID'S MOM
He's gone, honey. He's gone.

Despite Erica's best efforts, tears flood down her face.

DAVID'S MOM
He would have been happy that you

She just shakes her head, no idea there was more pain
left to feel.

Two police detectives, PITNEY and O'CONNOR, stand by

There is a small CD player by the bed. She reaches out

A song drifts through. ERIC CLAPTON, "Tears In Heaven."

She is dancing with David, swaying gently, by the bed.
His hand draws her dress up. His lips play on her neck.

She doesn't pick up. Walks towards the apartment door
and opens it.

INT. ERICA'S STAIRWELL - CORRIDOR - DAY C32

Erica, walking down the stairs towards the corridor that
leads to the open door -- and the street outside.

The corridor is long, dark, and eerie. The daylight
gleams through the open door, but seems threatening,
rather than comforting.

She finally manages the journey down it, which seems to
take an age.

She makes it to the half-open door, and sees the
silhouetted figures of construction workers on the
scaffolding opposite her building. A LOUD CRASH -- which
startles her. A plank has fallen to the ground below the
scaffolding.

A wind blows the dark netting, covering the scaffolding.
Eerie, unsettling.

EXT. ERICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/STREET - CONTINUOUS D32
ACTION

She makes it down the steps and heads down the street.

Then sees -- the dark phalanx of the rock of the park,

the trees above it. The same wind blowing the leaves.

She can't go on, turns back. And gasps as she walks
straight into the path of someone coming from behind.

She goes into the --

Runs a BATH, puts her HAND under the water, checks the

There is a HAND on her face, it is David's, trying to
calm her.

They are in a fight, she PUSHES HIM, his face crumbles,
she hates herself.

As Erica throws her arms around David, kissing him -- she
is SMASHED in the face, again and again and again and
again until she falls, lands almost softly on the dirt.

NICOLE (V.O.)

Hi. Me again. The pest. You
didn't call. I'm coming round...

Erica looks at the phone, looks at her apartment, her
jail -- her jacket on the chair where it's been for
days -- fuck it, it's time.

INT. ERICA'S APARTMENT - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY A36
Erica, coming down the stairs. She sees the corridor
ahead of her. Walks down it. Opens the door.
EXT. ERICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION B36
Sees the brightly-lit street. The figures of the
construction workers, eerie under the dark netting. She
makes it down the stoop.
To her left is the park. To her right, the street leads
to some distant projects. She chooses the right.
EXT. WEST 103RD STREET - DAY 36
It's the same street she walked at the beginning, before
the attack, a street she's walked a thousand times
before.
Hands in the pockets of her jacket, Erica heads down the
familiar, quiet three-block stretch.

ERICA'S POV

She MOVES FORWARD DOWN the sun-lit street, familiar with
its corners, its rhythms, its shadows --

But the sunlight only increases her unease. Every shadow
holds a terror for her.

A youth, sitting in the shadows on the stoop, talking
into his cell phone.

A car up ahead, a lone man sitting in it, again on the
shadowed side.

She speeds up to pass the car, but the CAMERA SLOWS ON
his face, the windscreen cut in half by the shadow, his
face against the shadowed seat.
He seems to be glaring at her.

Erica's eyes start scanning the street as she walks past
the MAN in the car.

The CAMERA SLOWS even more -- the few feet of shadowed
pavement seem to take forever to cover.

She makes it past, then the car door opens behind her.
The loud sound of a DOOR SLAMMING. Then FOOTSTEPS,
following.

She tries to calm herself but her battered body will not
listen -- her CHEST starts pounding, she wipes her sweaty
hands on her coat -- the sound of his FOOTSTEPS GROW
LOUDER, she can't bring herself to look around.

She YANKS herself back even as she picks up her pace --
the SOUND of her QUICKENING FOOTSTEPS, his FOOTSTEPS
quickening too, her breathing, her racing pulse blend
together until the SOUND DROPS OUT -- and Erica's
BREATHING becomes the unsettling soundtrack to her panic.

The man is alongside her now, on the street side.
FUCK!!!! She stops, dead. And the GUY, totally unaware

of her, walks on to the newspaper stand, buys his paper,
a pack of gum.

INT. POLICE STATION/MAIN AREA - DAY (PREVIOUSLY SC. 33) B37

Erica enters through the main doors. Holds onto the door
handle.

She looks at the lobby area of the police station -- cops
moving back and forwards with guns in holsters, people
milling around, sunlight streaming through the huge
windows.

It seems all she can to enter this public space. But she
does. Walks forward to the desk.

COP
Can I help you?

She checks a card.

ERICA
Detective Pitney or O'Connor
please.

COP

They're out presently. Could
anyone else help?

ERICA

Okay, a liaison officer will be

difficult this can be. If you

He gestures to the chairs.

ERICA'S POV

Maybe it's the isolation in their faces, the unbearable
knowledge that what happened to them will never matter to

anyone as much as it does to them -- but all of a sudden
Erica gets, as we do, what they have in common -- they're
victims -- and she is one of them.

After a beat, she gets up and leaves.

EXT. ERICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 37
Nicole comes up the sidewalk, carrying a bag of

groceries.

Erica is standing in the kitchen, watching Nicole put the
groceries away.

You haven't picked up your phone.

ERICA
I know, Nicole.

NICOLE

Nicole looks at Erica -- through her eyes, eyes that

They leave.

EXT. GUN STORE (CHINATOWN) - DAY 40

A small, nondescript gun store, with an outsized gun
dangling above the entrance. The same gun store Erica
saw in the photography show.

Erica crosses the street, walks into the store.

INT. GUN STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 41

A young MAN, buying bullets, at the counter. Erica
enters behind him, looking at the counter. A long row of

Erica lies in bed, TV ON. She picks up a bottle of anti-
depressants, looks at it, sets it down.

She picks up the GUN -- the weight of it, the steel, the
finality -- does what the anti-depressants and sleeping
pills and alcohol have failed to do, it calms her,
soothes her --

She places it beneath her pillow and closes her eyes.
And finally, sleeps.
EXT. STREETS (NEW YORK) - DAY 45

A MONTAGE OF SOUNDS -- as Erica walks about the city, her
digital sound recorder in her shoulder bag.

The mayhem of Times Square morphs into a subterranean
SCREECH, as Erica holds her microphone to the grating.

An overhead TRAIN ECHOES 'round an underpass, Erica
beneath, recording. The CRACK of HANDBALLS in a handball
alley, Erica outside the fence...

EXT. ERICA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY EVENING 46

Erica is sitting on the stoop, and the sounds all blur
into one as she fast plays through them. She is smoking.

Josai walks up, heads up the stairs. Erica moves over to
let her walk by.

But instead, Josai sits next to her.

Erica takes a drag, then offers one to Josai. Josai

none, rises --

JOSAI
But you have to figure out a way

Josai goes inside. Erica sits there, smoking.
She watches --
A stray dog walks down the street, staying in the
shadows. It could have been Curtis. But it's not.

EXT. SANDY'S MARKET - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT A47

Erica walks in.

INT. SANDY'S MARKET - NIGHT 47
Erica is in the back aisle of a small market getting
bottled water from the refrigerator. She's the only
customer in the store.

A YOUNG ASIAN WOMAN sits on a stool behind the cash
register.

A MAN, 30s, (SANDY) wearing a green flight jacket walks
in. He looks around the store for a couple seconds.

He doesn't see Erica who is obscured by the aisles.
THE WOMAN (IDA) responds immediately.

ASIAN WOMAN
When did you get out --

MAN
So you won't let me see my kids?

She reaches for the phone. Before her hand touches it,
he pulls a GUN and SHOOTS at her once -- blood sprays the
pictures of the children -- she goes down.
ON ERICA
Watching it on the curved security mirror mounted on the
ceiling. She is frozen in terror.
MAN
Fucking woman -- try seeing them
now.

He SHOOTS her AGAIN and AGAIN. Then reaches over and
grabs handfuls of cash from the register.

MAN
My money, too --

of sweat as she crouches lower to stay out of sight.

it OFF. Too late.

In the surveillance mirror she sees the GUNMAN heading

her way. She's trapped -- terrified.
ON GUNMAN
He rounds the corner -- and sees something, distorted by

the display of bottles to his left --
The muzzle of a Kahr K-9.

The last thing he ever sees is a FLASH OF FIRE from the
barrel as Erica pulls the trigger, BLOWING the bottles
apart.

ON ERICA
as she FIRES TWICE more, blindly, BOTTLES SHATTERING.

She listens to the silence then. Peers 'round the shelf
that divided them. Sees a spray of blood, hitting a
tomato can. Below it, the gunman dying, blood spouting
from a single shot to his jugular vein.

And then, in an act more significant than she knows, she
pulls it together: She lowers the cocked hammer on her
semi-automatic and puts it back in her pocket.

She surveys the STORE -- sees the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
pointed down at her.

She looks at the woman's dead body behind the counter and
realizes she is beyond help. She reaches in, ejects the
tape from the machine behind.

She looks at the blood on the sleeve of her coat, wipes
some from her cheek, hurries out of the store.

Erica, walking fast, almost maniacally, as if to get as
far away as possible from what she has done.

Blonde, thin, she walks, and gets looks from whoever is
left on the streets, "what the fuck is she doing there?"

But they leave her alone, not even sure why, they just
know enough to keep going.

She shakes her head.

He can't take it anymore. He stands.

He kisses her, on the cheek. Gently. Saying goodbye.

See? I didn't lose it. I didn't

but have you ever been afraid of
your own house, your own bedroom,
of the man you have to sleep
beside? When I get my daughter
out of there, I'll tell you
things. When I make her safe,
I'll tell you things. Until then,
I'm afraid of my own shadow.

He takes out her file, looks at the dead woman's photo.
His ex-wife was right, it is killing him.

Erica enters, locks the door behind her. She goes to a
cabinet, takes out the first bottle she sees, pours

herself a glass.

She takes the gun and videotape out of her pocket, peels
out of her coat. Throws the TAPE in a drawer.

She sits on the sofa, hands hanging off her knees, a
speck of blood riding her cheek --

51 INT. ERICA'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 51
Erica lets the shower pound her body. Thinner still than
when we first saw her, more desperate, and somehow, at
least in this light, more powerful.

INT. SANDY'S MARKET - NIGHT 53

A police photographer photographs the dead body behind
the counter. Several uniforms stand around.

Hey, good to see you.

Vietnamese female -- Ida...
Hands Mercer her I.D.
MERCER

Combs. So what does that tell us?
VITALE

They were married? See, I'm way

MERCER
One way to end it.

He looks from the woman's body to the man's.

VITALE
What's wrong with divorce?

MERCER
Everything. Divorce sucks. So,
tell me --

VITALE

He shot her in the neck, torso and
face. Thirty-eight. Then
somebody smoked him. Nine
millimeter automatic. Don't ask
me who.

Mercer looks over at the cash strewn on the ground.

MERCER
Why didn't they take the money?

VITALE
Got scared?

Vitale takes a plastic bag out of his coat pocket. It
contains three shell casings.

VITALE
They picked this up -- looks like
there's a partial print on one but
it's smudged.

MERCER
Did you check the surveillance
tape?

VITALE

Machine's empty --

That bugs Mercer. He goes to the drawer under the

machine -- finds a tape -- STICKS one in -- it PLAYS.
MERCER
Machine's working -- where's the
tape?

Vitale shrugs.
MERCER
Three casings. He was only hit
once. What does that tell you?

VITALE
Crappy shooter.

Looking at the body. The entry wound in the neck.

MERCER
Or. He'd never shot a gun before.

Mercer studies the entry point, and angle of entry of the
bullet -- steps back, looks at the dead man, draws an
imaginary trajectory in his mind and walks over to where
Erica was.

Looks at the LIGHT again -- as she does, it turns

She shifts her body. Takes another sip of water, as she
does the light changes from yellow to GREEN.

Time for her COMMENTARY, the end of her piece. She takes

moves them aside, leans into the mic. Speaks personally,
straight from the heart.

ERICA
New York the safest big city in
the world. It is horrible to fear
the place you once loved. To see
a (street) corner you knew so well
and familiar steps and be unable
to climb them.

Her voice strong, intimate.

ERICA
I never understood how people
lived with fear. (people who lived

Erica on her way home from the cemetery; Erica rides the
near-empty car, the ride soothing her.

Down the car, two GUYS in hoodies are sitting opposite a
STUDENT, listening to his IPOD, giving him grief.

GUY #1
What sounds you got there?

When the Student doesn't respond, he whips the IPOD from
his hands.

STUDENT (ETHAN)

He smacks the kid across the face.

STUDENT (ETHAN)
Radiohead --

As the Student turns his face away from the blow, his
eyes meet Erica's.

GUY #1
Radio. Head.

He yanks the earphones from around his neck.

A BEARDED MAN interrupts. He has a boy sitting beside
him.

FATHER (BEARDED MAN)
Why don't you leave him alone?

They both turn to look at this brave soul. The boy,
nervous, edges closer to his father. The SECOND GUY
plumps down beside him.
GUY #2
Did you know your daddy sucks
cock?

He pushes the father's head down, holds it there,
pretends he's giving him a blow job.

FATHER
You little shit --

The Father wrestles his head free, brings his hand up.
But the Guy has a knife out now, to his nose.

GUY #2
Good at it, too --

Finally the train comes to a STOP.

The man takes the opportunity to grab his boy's hand and
head for the doors.

The Student follows, looking back to see Erica, sitting
calmly at the back.

And he moves VERY CLOSE to her, flicks her earbuds out of
her ears with his knife.

GUY #1
(soft)
You gonna give me some Radiohead

Suddenly -- he is thrown back, a MIST OF BLOOD, as the
BULLET blows through his back. The other one lunges
toward her, she FIRES again, he spins around and staggers
toward the other end of the car.

Wounded, he falls back against the doors.

His head slides to one side as he dies, blood streaking

turns, and walks into it.
INT. BAR - NIGHT 83
LOUD MUSIC. A brash, dating crowd. Erica pushes through
a sea of men's faces and walks down circular stairs
towards the restroom.
INT. BAR RESTROOM - NIGHT A84
Erica pushes through the door and dry-retches into the
sink. Her face is now covered in beads of sweat. She
runs the taps and bathes her face in water. Breathes

deeply, looks up at the stranger in the mirror. Herself.

ERICA
Hey, you...

ON her face in the mirror. Unnaturally calm, again.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT 84
BRIGHT POLICE ARC LIGHTS blast the tunnel. Police are

Like the other night.

VITALE
So?

MERCER
Check it against Brass-Catcher,
see if it matches.

He gives Vitale the casing, walks over to one of the
bodies, crouches down, looks at the tear the bullet made
in the guy's T-shirt, checks the angle and level of
entry.

Looks at the IPOD next to the GUY, the ALBUM COVER still
on the screen -- RADIOHEAD, looks at the dead guy's
clothes -- not a fit -- he turns the IPOD over, sees the
SERIAL NUMBER, bags it.

Vitale comes over.

MERCER
Neither one robbed. Both have
cash in their pockets.

The CORONER and an assistant start to bag the body of the
man who died sitting up.

MERCER
Hey, what're you doing?

CORONER
(attitude)
Takin' him to the morgue.

MERCER
I'll tell you when you can take
him.

CORONER

My shift is ending, as it is I'll
be lucky if I have time for both
bodies. So, how about you just
let me do my job?

MERCER
(impatient)
How about you don't do anything
until I'm done?

CORONER
How about, fuck you, asshole?

He starts to bag the body; Mercer's so shocked it takes
him a second to respond. Just as he starts for the guy,
Vitale puts an arm out.

Mercer calms himself.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT 86

Erica emerges, tense, nervous, from the bar. More lights
flash past her face, as TV trucks and news crews arrive.
She looks at the subway entrance, sees the gathering
crowd around it. She is pinioned for a moment, drawn to
the scene, yet repulsed by it.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 87

Mercer walks over to the knife on the ground, the trail
of blood across the floor.

MERCER
They both have priors?

VITALE
A busload of them.

MERCER
That guy at Sandy's had priors,
and wasn't robbed.

VITALE
That was domestic --

MERCER
Yeah -- I don't know, there's
something.
Walks around, thinking.
MERCER

None of the three were robbed --
all three had priors --

He walks over and sits where Erica sat.

Damn -- if that's true --

MERCER
He's getting better. Every bullet
hit home.

EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 88
The gathering crowd, local TV trucks arriving. Yellow

tape around the subway entrance. Police keeping the

crowds out...

And Erica, finally, turns and walks back towards the

scene. If anything or anyone is going to stop her, it

will be there.

Everything about her is different -- her walk, the hunch

of her shoulders, she's thin, pale -- both exposed and

protected, damaged and tough, a ghost and a new being all
wrapped up in one.

nearest platform. He looks left and right. Two exits.

He heads for the nearest one.

a CROWD, and some media. A couple of REPORTERS try to

ask him questions, he waves them off.

As he turns away, he sees a FACE he thinks he recognizes.

They catch eyes for just a moment -- but it's enough to
make Erica turn, walk away.

MERCER (0O.S.)
Hey. Hang on.

She stops. Panicked, suddenly. Tries to quell it, her
face turned away from him. She finally succeeds, and
turns to face him.

MERCER
Don't I know you -- *

Her eyes, meeting his. Will this be the moment that
makes her stop?

ERICA
Don't think we've ever met.

On his face. Trying to place her. And she has to fill
in the silence.

MERCER *
No, wait. I know you. What's *
your name? *
ERICA
Erica Bain. I -- ah -- do a radio
show.
He places her now. The hospital. *

Any more shitheads die while we
were sleeping?

MERCER
Not that I know of.

most from REPORTERS. Vitale tosses the Post on the desk,
headline blaring: VIGILANTE???

Anyway -- she has a radio show.

She showed up at the subway --
Guess who she wants to interview?

Mercer nods.

VITALE
You?
VITALE
Remember that Bernie Goetz
thing -- the guys said reporters

were calling in the middle of the
night. Reporters love this shit.

MERCER

She's not a reporter.

VITALE

What is she then, a DJ?
MERCER

No. She's just... interesting.

She looks at him, quickly glances down at his gun, his
handcuffs. Looks around, instinctively wanting to run --

He puts on his jacket, covering the gun.

ERICA
You again.

MERCER
Yeah. Me. Remember last night?

She stops dead. Almost waiting for him to cuff her.

used to listen to your show -- and

that's why I stopped you at the
subway, and I wanted you to know
that.

It was upsetting. You were --
gone. It's kind of strange to see
someone that... can't see you.
And now you're back.

ERICA

MERCER

Not on this side of the table.

MERCER

Everybody talks. And almost
everybody lies. But a dead body
can't.

But then the lies can tell you
things as well. People tell them
for a reason.

ERICA
So... those bodies last night? *
What are they telling you? *

MERCER
You read the paper.

ERICA
Should I believe what I read *
there? *

But Mercer's attention is drawn to the TV.

ON TV: Murrow, the MAN from the hospital, is getting out

of a car,

his arm around his frightened stepdaughter. He

tightens his hold on the girl as they head past a crowd
of reporters and into an APARTMENT building.

What else does he do? *
MERCER *
Imports drugs, guns, people, *

whatever's in demand. I found

three guys that crossed him

superglued to a table, their

throats filled with expanding

cement. I had his wife almost

ready to testify, when she blew

her brains out. Gun in her hand.

Nothing adds up, except the

lawyers he hires. Now he's got

custody of his stepdaughter and

it's not for sentimental reasons. *
He knows she knows something and I *
don't want to think about what

he'll do to her. But maybe you

know his nicer side...

ERICA
So why can't you nail him?

MERCER
Because I follow the law.

ERICA
And there's nothing you can do?

MERCER
Nothing that's legal.

He has said too much, and realizes it. He holds his hand

cross.

MERCER

Me? Never. No matter how bad I
feel about it.

ERICA

Have you ever shot anyone?
MERCER

Yes.
ERICA

Did your hands shake?

MERCER
No. That's one of the benefits of
being on the right side. A
benefit --

subway shooter don't have.

A stranger.
He can read her emotion.
MERCER
You must have loved him very much.
ERICA
Yes.
MERCER

And that makes it harder.
Sometimes you wish you didn't...

He is talking about himself. He reaches for his absent
ring. She notices that.

ERICA
You're not married?

MERCER
My ex-wife's having a baby with
another man. So I'd pretty much
say, yes. I'm not married.

They have both revealed a bit too much.

MERCER
So. More cop stuff, or are we
done?

ERICA
I'm good.

She turns off the tape. And suddenly he seems almost
disappointed. He gestures for the check. She stops his

ERICA (V.O.)
Why is somebody doing his job for

She passes a car, by an underpass and hears a voice
coming from it.

CUTLER
Hey --

She stops, turns. Sees a guy sitting in the car, who is
making the wrong presumption about her.

ERICA
Hello?
CUTLER
What's up?
ERICA
Not much.
CUTLER
So, what would fifty dollars do
for you?

Erica hesitates. Is about to walk on. Then sees a YOUNG
GIRL in the back seat.

ERICA
Shouldn't she be at home?

CUTLER
She got no home. Have you, honey?

The girl shakes her head. Tries a smile. Erica assesses
the situation.

ERICA

CUTLER
Get in.

He opens the door of the passenger seat. After a moment,
Erica gets in.

incredibly sinister.

ERICA

ERICA
So what's he got in mind, Chloe?

Chloe looks at her with eyes that have had

Erica slowly shakes her head. And he goes

CUTLER
But you're a whore, right? I'm

She goes to open the door. Quick as a flash, the man

hits the door button.

CUTLER
Nope. Cunts can't leave.

He snorts from a Baggie.

Erica takes a breath. Looks back at the girl. She can

And he stops. Erica has the gun to his temple.

With the gun to his head, he has no options. Hands her

CHLOE
There you go, sicko --

Chloe leaves the car. Erica gets out of her door. Chloe
is unsteady on her legs. Erica holds her arm, leads her
away from the car.

ERICA
You got family there, Chloe? In
Las Vegas?

CHLOE
No. Went there from Albuquerque.

ERICA
You got enough money to get home?

And suddenly we hear the SCREECHING of TIRES. The car is
driving towards them, fast. Chloe ducks one way. Erica
stands, as the car dives straight towards her and SHOOTS.
ONCE, TWICE, THREE times.

The man's blood is spattered all over the windscreen and
the car slews sideways. Hits Chloe, who goes bouncing
over the roof. The car hits a metal post and comes to a
dead halt.

Erica runs over to Chloe. She is alive, but her leg is
broken.

ERICA
I'm sorry.

Chloe looks up at her, stunned, in shock, out of it, all

at once.
CHLOE
Where am I, huh? This is still
America?
ERICA

Your leg is broken.

CHLOE
And who the hell are you?

SAME SCENE - LATER

Chloe's sleeping face, on the ground. A hand slaps her
awake again. A policeman's hand. A light shines in her

Police all over the scene. A crowd, gathered, looking.
Behind the crowd, in the shadows --

Erica. She knows the young girl is safe. As Chloe is
led towards an ambulance, she walks away.

Erica walking home, wired, tense.

She gets to the entrance. Josai is on the stoop, sitting

JOSAI

Erica ascends the steps. As she does, Josai takes her
hands.

JOSAI
Are you alright? Your hands are
cold as ice.
She looks at Erica's face -- Erica turns away.

He steps away, Mercer moves to the podium.

MERCER
Ballistic tests have linked the
shooting last night to both the
shooting in the market and the
shooting on the subway.

And the feeding frenzy begins, in an AD-LIB flurry of

questions:

"How was that determined?" "What evidence?"

"Linked by what?"

Mercer points to the first PERSON he sees.

Was the same gun used in all three
shootings?

him.

Why do you think you can hurt
people?
MURROW
What?
He turns.

her gun. He takes a crowbar from the car and suddenly
turns on her.

MURROW
You got a camera there, huh?
Yeah, well I have something for
you.

He lunges at her with the crowbar. Erica brings her hand
up to protect her face. The crowbar slices through her
jacket, opening her skin. She staggers backwards.

MURROW
Take my fucking picture? Come to
my place, take my picture?
He brings the crowbar down towards her again. She twists
her body, to avoid it and finds herself face-to-face with
him. She suddenly slams her forehead into the bridge of
his nose.

He staggers back, dropping the crowbar, his nose
exploding with blood.

Don't touch me -- I'm sick --

Erica's too weak to resist her. As Josai drags her to
the table, the gun falls on the floor.

JOSAI
I can see that --

And finally Erica cracks. Shudders of weeping go through
her, as Josai holds her, trying to calm her.

JOSAI
Hush now. Hush.

As the shuddering subsides --

JOSAI
We have to get you to a hospital.
ERICA
No.
JOSAI
Why not?
ERICA

Because I can't.

JOSAI
What kind of trouble are you in?

ERICA
You don't want to know.

Josai lets this sit.

JOSAI
Okay then. Take your coat off --

Erica allows Josai to remove her coat.

She goes to the bathroom, brings back alcohol, bandages,
tape.

Erica winces as Josai applies alcohol to the wound.

ERICA
(off Josai's
steady hand)
Were you a nurse?

JOSAI
When I had to be.

She threads the needle, plunges it through Erica's skin,
quickly, efficiently.

Erica slumps into a chair from the pain. Josai cuts the
thread with her teeth.

JOSAI

This is going to leave a scar.
ERICA

I killed a man tonight.
JOSAI

Because he did this to you?
ERICA

No. I would have killed him

anyway.
Josai looks at the gun on the floor.

JOSAI
Back home -- they gave young boys
guns, made them kill their
parents. Just to show us. Anyone
can cross that line. Anyone can
be a killer. Anyone can have
those dead eyes. And each death
leaves a hole, waiting to be
filled.

Now, all of this is off the

ERICA
Okay... If I knew what it was.

MERCER
Witness to a shooting.

She stops a moment. Covers her alarm.

ERICA
Isn't this against procedure?

MERCER
Yes.

He waits for her response. There is none.
MERCER
I've seen her twice. Seems scared

Alright...

She looks at Erica. Back at Mercer.
MERCER
So maybe you can talk now? Tell
me what you remember.
A slight smile plays around her lips.
MERCER
You gonna tell us what you saw

Chloe raises her finger and points at Erica. It's like
being in the sights of a gun. Mercer looks from Chloe to

Erica.

MERCER
Are you trying to say something?

Depends on what you mean by help.

She stops. Is this a direct accusation? Then he covers

Yes, she did.

Yeah.

A165 INT./EXT. SUBWAY TUNNEL (WASHINGTON HEIGHTS) - NIGHT A165

Erica, walking down a long, neon-lit subway tunnel.
Suddenly her CELL PHONE RINGS. She stops, leans against
the tiled wall, opens it.

A TEXT MESSAGE has been sent.

ON THE MESSAGE
as Erica opens it.
REED BRYANT -- 90 WEST 218th STREET

UNDERNEATH THAT, there is an attachment, she OPENS that.

ON PHONE SCREEN

Monochromatic, shaky IMAGES, downloaded from the CAMERA
PHONE, of the assault. David getting smashed with a
pipe, Erica getting kicked, beaten, fear on her face,
helplessness on David's. She watches it all, ten seconds
that last a lifetime.

CAMERA CIRCLES her, as she slumps back against the tiled
wall, then pulls back down the eerie, neon-lit tunnel,
until she is a tiny, slumped figure, the glow of her cell
phone screen illuminating her face.

ON HER CELL PHONE

She scrolls down to find Mercer's number. She sends a
simple text-message reading: GOODBYE. Then hits the
attachment button.

ERICA
Goodbye...

Then she slowly rises and walks back TOWARDS us. Towards
the subway entrance and the world of the street outside.
Hands in her pockets, a frightening sense of purpose in
her walk.

His PHONE is RINGING again. He takes it out and sees an
attachment from Erica. The brutal beating. Anda single
word:

GOODBYE.

He breaks into a run.

166 EXT. WEST 218TH STREET - SAME TIME 166

Erica walks past a public housing apartment complex.
Built in the thirties, some architect's dream of social
perfection which has turned into a nightmare.

Youths huddle in dimly-lit alleyways. Each car that
passes THROBS with DRUM AND BASS. She shouldn't be here,
at this hour, but she's not going to stop.

She comes to the recessed entrance of number 90. The
number above the door seems to taunt her. She walks
toward it.

She lights her cigarette lighter. The flame of the
lighter illuminates the button panel. About a hundred
metal bell-pushes, the names below them scratched and
obscured.

As she's about to push them at random, the door suddenly
opens. An old lady steps out. Erica holds the closing
door open and walks inside.

A170 INT. 90 WEST 218TH STREET - NIGHT A170

Dark blue, peeling walls. An eerie faded elegance to the
hallway. She could be in some slum in Havana. She heads
for the stairs, rising up many stories. Then she sees,
THROUGH the scratched toughened glass of the outside
window.

B170 EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT B170

Three figures, in the warren of the back alleyways. The
glow of a match on a cigarette or a pipe. And a dog,
attached to a leash. Her dog. Curtis.

The last thing she expected to see.

ERICA
Curtis --

He can neither smell her or sense her through the glass.

She feels her gun. Looks round the hallway, for a back
exit.

Then she walks through the faded hallway. Turns a corner
and sees a door. Pushes it open. There is a broken
stairway, leading to the back alleyways. Sounds of
VOICES, O.S.

She takes a breath, then makes her way down.

OMITTED AD170

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT D170

This alleyway is empty. Erica moves in the shadows.
Fully transformed, she seeks only one thing -- and she's
not stopping until she gets it.

It's nerve-racking -- the RHYTHMIC crunch of her
FOOTSTEPS as she moves deeper into the dark.

A VOICE, quiet, comes from the darkness -- from the
alleyway beyond --

REED (0.S.)

an eye out, how hard can that be?

Two young kid wannabe's with Reed, obey him instantly, *

She turns toward the sounds -- carried from a distance in

the quiet, nothing inside her but an absence of light.

Curtis hears her voice, turns, stares. Does he remember
her or not?

Reed turns to find out what's going on -- sees Erica
standing there -- close, so close she can smell him.
REED
What the fuck do you want?
ERICA
(quiet)
I want my dog back.
ERICA BLOWS HIM AWAY -- with a bullet through his left
eye.

CURTIS YELPS in fear, darts backwards at the sound.

Curtis, in the shadows. Erica with the gun in one hand,

Remember me?

He still doesn't move. And it almost makes her cry. She
walks towards him, touches his head. A low GROWL comes
from him.
INT. MERCER'S CAR - NIGHT 180
Mercer, still on the phone.
MERCER

He swings the wheel, does a sudden U-turn.

The two kids in a doorway across the street. Cash

emerges, his hand at the back belt of his trousers, runs *
towards the alley.

Erica strokes Curtis' head. He has stopped growling, but
is still wary.

ERICA *
Did they treat you bad, boy? *
But he is obeying different masters now. His ears prick *

up, sensing something. He turns, pads off, towards the
shadows.

Watching, as Curtis pads through a gap in a broken wire- *

She follows the fence, on the other side. Then her *
vision of Curtis is blocked by a low wall. And there is *

A hand, in the shadows, cocking a gun. Curtis ambles up
to it, licks it. The hand pushes the dog away. We see

Cash's face.

CASH
Get off, bitch --

A SOUND behind him. He turns. Sees a figure, gun drawn.
Erica.

ERICA
Only one bitch here --

She blows him away. SHOOTS ONCE. TWICE. THREE times.
The DOG YELPS, fearful of the gunfire, and fearful of
her. Darts into the shadows.

corner, sees the broken doorway of a ruined, ground-floor

Every shadow tells her not to go in there. And she
doesn't. She walks silently past it, towards a broken
window, rubble reaching down to the ground. She walks
through.

INT. RUINED APARTMENT - NIGHT 195

Erica, inside. The trashed remains of habitation in
there. And a RUSTLE of sound, again. Then, a WHINE.

ERICA
Curtis --

She sees the dog, straining at the leash. And she
realizes the leash has been caught, or tied, to a broken
bedpost.

Then she hears a voice, echoing through the ruined
apartment.

LEE (0.S.)
Don't you know there's a fucking
leash law?

She whirls round, gun drawn, and is pummelled to the
ground by Lee, coming out of the shadows. Her GUN
CLATTERS across the floor. She reaches for it. And his
boot comes down on her outstretched hand. He is holding
a pipe in his hand.

LEE
Don't think that's funny, huh?
You, me and that dog again?

He places the pipe around her neck and drags her to her
feet, almost strangling her.

ON ERICA'S FACE

The pipe strangling her windpipe. She is struggling for
breath.

LEE
Made your boyfriend smile. Gonna
make you smile, too --

He withdraws the pipe. She draws one long strangled
breath. He braces his arms, to smash her mouth with the
pipe --

When a SHOT RINGS OUT. Hits the wall, behind Lee's head.
Mercer is there, by the broken doorway.

No. I have the right to hunt him

Shoot him then!

He is moving towards her all the time.

What are you gonna do, arrest him?

Yeah. Arrest me, officer.

She shoots him in the head.

ERICA
Shut the fuck up --

He falls back, a surprised look on his face, dead.
The GUNSHOT ECHOES. All the air seems to deflate out of

You see, there was no vigilante.
Just three punks on a killing
spree. They got a taste of it in
Central Park. Then bought
themselves a gun. And they turned

winged, did what I had to do.

And she FIRES. Hits him in the arm. He spins, falls
against the wall.

MERCER
You know, that really hurts...

She drops the gun, bends down to him.

He holds her with his good arm. She buries her head in
