EXT/ INT. MOHSINA'S HOUSE. DAY

Faisal arrives in his jeep outside Mohsina's house. Mohsina's
younger sister sees him and goes in to tell Mohsina. Mohsina
comes running out to the balcony. Faisal steps out of his jeep
oozing lots of forced style - almost comic. Mohsina throws him
a flying kiss. They flirt with each other. Faisal walks towards
the house. Mohsina rushes inside her room to add make up.
When she steps out of her room she notices that Faisal is sitting
down with her parents, entertaining them with his new pager.
Snacks are being served. Mohsina is surprised. She dances with
joy. Then joins everyone. All look happy. Faisal leaves. Music.
