 Looks over the room.                                                          
 Sees Jenny for the first time --

 For a brief moment their eyes meet --

 A HOSTESS approaches Jeff.                                                    
 He follows her through the Main Room past Jenny --                             
 Toward the private cubicles...

 The MAN IN THE BRIEFCASE PHOTO, and three others at the table --               
 Big time CHINESE GANGSTERS.                                                   
 And they look it.                                                             
 Tough, cruel, very ugly.                                                      
 BODYGUARDS stand around lean against the walls fill the doorways...           
 No noise except the SLAPPING of the tiles on the table as the game progresses.

 The Hostess speaks quietly to Jeff - indicates down the hallway --             
 then leaves.                                                                  
 Jeff moves down the corridor, eyes the doorways                                 
 Stops near the fourth door...                                                 
 He leans up against the wall outside the room.                                
 Pulls on a pair of thin white gloves.                                         
 Brings one of the WALTHERS up out of his coat --                               
 Knocks lightly on the door.                                                   
 A BODYGUARD cautiously opens the door.                                        
 And the FIREFIGHT BEGINS --                                                    
 Jeff FIRES TWO SHOTS into his stomach.                                        
 Then drives into him, forcing the door open --                                 
 Rolls into the room...

 Jeff lands on his back, now with a pistol in each hand --                             
 BLOWS AWAY the two GUARDS.

 Reaches for his gun --

 Immediately on his feet with his arms extended in each direction -- A cross with a gun
 at each end.                                                                         
 He looks down the barrel of the pistol in his right hand.                            
 It's trained on the Man In The Photo.                                                
 Without looking he SHOOTS a GUARD drawing a gun behind him.                          
                                                                                     
 MAN IN THE PHOTO                                                                     
                                                                                     
 His gun half drawn --                                                                 
 Staring at the barrel of Jeff s gun pointed at him...                                 
                                                                                     
 JEFF                                                                                 
                                                                                     
 Hesitates...                                                                         
 Then BLASTS a hole in the man's forehead.                                            
 FIRES three more in his chest with the other gun.                                    
 Wheels around and BLOWS AWAY a THUG who has come through the door behind             
 him.                                                                                 
 The SOUND of a SHOTGUN PUMP --                                                        
 Jeff leaps to his right as the SHOTGUN FIRES.                                        
 He avoids the full impact of the BLAST --                                              
 Takes some PELLETS in his back.                                                      
                                                                                     
 SMALL BAR                                                                            
                                                                                     
 The BARTENDER pumps the shotgun for a second BLAST --                                 
 Jeff moves toward him CONTINUOUSLY FIRING both pistols.                              
 Every bullet rips into the Bartender's body.                                         
 His second pellet blast FIRES uselessly into the ceiling.

 Jeff sees one of the Thug's PISTOLS on the card table --                                 
 He steps on the edge of the table, catapulting the revolver through the air and into his

 A BULLET SPLINTERS the door jamb beside his head.                                       
 She jumps out of the way.                                                               
 Jeff BLASTS a THUG in the distance behind her --

 Jenny runs down the corridor back toward the main room of the club...                   
 Jeff gaining on her from behind --                                                       
 He Tackles her just as ANOTHER THUG FIRES a blast --                                      
 Intended for him --

 From the floor Jeff BLASTS the THUG before he can fire again --                          
 Jenny struggles to get up --                                                             
 ANOTHER THUG with a gun appears en the other side of her.                               
 Jeff shoots across Jenny's face --

 Another night.                                                    
 Jenny sings ANOTHER SONG.                                         
 There is an oversized brandy snifter on top of her keyboard.      
 Across the way Jeff stands at the bar, watching her.              
 He finishes his drink.                                            
 Approaches Jenny.                                                 
 Jeff puts a wad of bills in the snifter --                         
 Lingers a moment.                                                 
 She feels his presence.                                           
 Turns her dead eyes in his direction.

 He can't answer.                                                  
 Moves away.

 Others are closing.                                               
 Jeff comes out of the Pale Flower.                                
 Lights a cigarette.                                               
 Moves off down the street.

 Jenny is packing up to leave.                                     
 She takes the money from the snifter.                             
 Puts it in her purse.                                             
 A WAITER tries to help her to the door --

 She knows the way out.                                              
 No need for the white cane she carries.

 Jenny  comes   out  of   the  nightclub.                            
 Turns  left  and  starts up  the street.                            
 Now she needs the cane --                                            
                                                                    
 Behind her a MOTORCYCLE comes slowly up the street.                 
 TWO RIDERS.                                                         
 They trail her for a moment.                                        
 Speed up --                                                          
 The passenger GRABS Jenny's bag.                                    
 Knocks her over.                                                    
 The Driver accelerates...                                           
 Gets about ten feet. Jeff suddenly appears out of the shadows --     
 A FLYING KICK sends Driver and Passenger sprawling.                 
 The motorcycle CRASHES into a flower stand --

 Pounces on the Kid with Jenny's bag                                 
 Grabs the bag as the Driver runs off.
 Jeff indicates the other Kid should follow him --                    
 He does.                                                            
 And fast.

 On her hands and knees groping for her cane --                       
 Jeff comes over to her.                                             
 Tries to help her up --                                              
 She thinks it's one of the muggers --                                
 Wrenches free.

 She finds her cane and swings it at him.                            
 He catches it.                                                      
 Then grabs her hands.

                Yes. A couple of guys on a motorcycle tried to take

                Thank you, but you've done enough for me already --

                Then, maybe you can reward me by letting me take

                It's probably better that way. Here's the car.

 He opens the door and helps her into the car.                           
 It's difficult for her.

 As he closes the door --

                I got rid of him. I feel sorry enough for myself. I      
                didn't need any more help.

                          I came back because I felt guilty. I'm telling you        
                          because I want you. I want to be with you.

                          you. I thought maybe you'd come to the bar, but                    
                          then I didn't know.

                I  always  did.  But  when you  can't  open  them. It's

 The teeming city going about its mid-day bustle.                                  
 Sidney, carrying a BROWN LEATHER BRIEFCASE, moves through the crowd.

 Sidney picking his way through the densely packed vehicle as it jerks down the
 crowded boulevard.                                                                
 He stops and grabs a strap next to a MAN READING A NEWSPAPER.                     
 Sets his briefcase down --                                                         
 Next to a similar BRIEFCASE OF BLACK LEATHER at the Man's feet.                   
 The Man reading the newspaper pays no attention to Sidney.                        
 The exit bell RINGS --                                                             
 Many passengers begin to disembark.                                               
 The Man with the newspaper reaches down, grabs Sidney's suitcase and heads for the
 exit...

 Watches the man with the newspaper disappear from view through the window as the
 streetcar again lurches forward.                                                  
 Reaches down and picks up the black suitcase.                                     
 Finds a seat.                                                                     
 Puts the suitcase across his lap.                                                 
 Drums his fingers on it for a moment.                                             
 Then lights a cigarette.

                       the singer. Jenny Kwan. He risked his life for the          
                       little girl. He's sentimental. Probably a major

                       He may be soft on blind girls and kids, but he's got        
                       to be smart enough to get out of town. There were           
                       people trying to kill him out there today. I doubt

 Reaches for the briefcase.                                              
 Sidney quickly picks up the gun.                                         
 Points it between Jeff s eyes.

 This strikes Jeff as being very funny.                                   
 Sidney's not kidding.                                                   
 He pulls the trigger.                                                    
 An empty CLICK.                                                          
 Jeff opens his other hand.                                               
 Lets the bullets fall on the floor.                                      
 His other hand pulls another gun out of his waistband --                  
 Points it at Sidney's head.

 Tums and FIRES into the plate glass window behind him --

                            What kind of way is that to do your job? Does this
        look like a trash bin to you? It's a fire escape.  Look
        there's trash everywhere. What if there's a fire?

 Laundry lines....

 A shed which houses the air conditioning unit.                                     
 But no sign of Jeff..

 Takes a quick look in the shed.                                                     
 Nobody there.                                                                       
 He moves quickly around the corner.                                                 
 And runs straight into a flock of suddenly loosed hysterical PIGEONS.               
 Finally free of'"the birds --

 Lee's at the bottom of' the steps.                                                
 Narrow byways lead in several directions.                                      
 Like an obstacle course in a Fun House.                                         
 Stoned out junkies.                                                               
 Serious looking hard guys.                                                    
 No trace of Jenny or Sidney.                                                 
 Lee begins to see Chang's point.

                  There''s no place they can go. All we have to do is               
                  wait them out. We have informers inside. They'll               
                  find them.

                  When they do I'm going in. With or without you. I            
                  lived through the South Bronx, I can live through            
                  this.

 Dark, narrow, filthy. stone streets.                                              
 Houses made of stone,                                                             
 Thugs in front of Sidney and Jenny lead them through the maze.                    
 Thugs behind them.

 Jeff takes Jenny in his arms.                                                      
 As the door closes behind them --

 One could hear the proverbial pin drop --                                                     
 And something does.                                                                            
 Plop.                                                                                              
 Again...                                                                                           
 Plop.                                                                                              
 Jeff and Lee look down at the floor   blood...
 Both simultaneously turn their guns upward and begin BLASTING --                          
 Paul Yau in the open rafters BLASTINGback                                                   
 But he is cut to ribbons by their slugs                                                      
 Yao falls, crashing down at Jeff's and Lee's feet -- very dead.                                
 A long silent moment.                                                     
 Jeff and Lee find each other's eyes.

 Lee pulls the trigger.

 Jeff whistles a bullet by his ear.

 Jeff, Jenny, and Lee come out of another alley.                         
 On to the lighted, active street.                                       
 An old, beat up car is parked there.                                    
 Covered with dust.                                                      
 Looks like it hasn't been driven in weeks.                              
 Jeff pulls a golf bag full of guns out of the trunk --

                  Where the hell are the cops? They're supposed to be
                  watching the exits.

 Tosses Lee the keys --                                                   
 They get into the car.                                                   
 Jeff reaches into the golf bag, SNICKS a fresh clip into his auto.      
 Lee starts it and they pull away...

 Jeff and Jenny in the back.                                             
 Jenny rests her head on Jeff s shoulder.                                
 Something causes her to raise back up --                                 
 She touches her cheek

 There's blood on it.

 Jeff is bleeding through his shirt.

 Jenny starts to pull off Jeff s coat --

 Jeff still has the gun --                                              
 She again touches his shoulder

 The headlights of the car illuminate Jeff, Jenny and Lee.             
 They sit at the edge of the water --                                   
 Lee slits open Jeff s bloodstained shirt.                             
 A slug embedded in his arm just below the shoulder.

 The thug reaches inside Sidney's coat to take his gun.                     
 Sidney reaches inside the thugs coat.                                      
 Comes up with the thugs gun first --

 Two thugs swiftly lift Sidney to his feet.                                 
 Stand him up in front of Payne.

 He goes.

 Payne cuts off Sidney's tie.                                               
 Slits open his shirt.

                    I'm a very different man than my father Sidney. He       
                    never liked to get involved in this side of our          
                    business. I prefer not just to be involved but to be
                    'hands on' as the Americans say. I don't mind getting
                    my hands dirty or bloody...                             
                                                                           
 A gout of blood spatters on Payne.                                         
 He makes the first cuts in Sidney's stomach --

               Do you want to tell me now, or do I keep cutting?            
                                                                           
 Sidney seems to pass out.                                                  
 The guards struggle to hold on to him.                                     
 His dead weight sinks to the floor.                                        
 Suddenly Sidney hurls himself backward knocking both guards over backwards.
 Sidney lands on them                                                       
 Rolls.                                                                     
 Grabs a gun off the body of a dead thug.                                   
 Blasts both guards --

 Throws the cleaver at Sidney.                                              
 Then goes for a gun in the drawer --

 Dodges the cleaver.                                                        
 Leaps to his feet.

 Sidney grabs Payne by the hair.                                            
 Gun at his tempIe.

 The elevator opens.                                                              
 Sidney and Payne get out.                                                        
 Payne carries the briefcase.                                                       
 Sidney still holds the gun on Payne.                                             
 He's bleeding badly.                                                             
 Weak.

 Three thugs come running up out of the bowels of the garage.                     
 Guns drawn.                                                                      
 Sidney shouts at them in Cantonese.                                              
 They don't understand.                                                           
 They're Vietnamese.

 They start for the elevator.                                                     
 Sidney takes one of their guns.                                                  
 Puts it in his pocket.

 A button is pushed the doors close.                                    
 Sidney then BLASTS the button --                                         
 He hustles Payne over to his car.                                      
 Sidney takes the briefcase.                                            
 Throws it in the back.                                                 
 Sidney gets behind the wheel.                                          
 Leaves Payne standing on the pavement.

                            You're a dead man, Sidney,

                 Jeff told you. It's not smart to threaten a man with a
                 gun.                                                   
                                                                       
 Sidney FIRES!                                                          
 Hits Payne in the chest --                                              
 He drops to the pavement.                                              
 Sidney fires again to make sure.                                        
 It clicks empty.                                                       
 Sidney throws the gun at prostrate, unconscious Payne.                 
 Puts the car in gear.                                                  
 Roars off.

 Sidney wounded bleeding, and furious.                                  
 Hurtles through the garage --                                           
 Bashes through the exit banner and out onto the street...

 Payne lying on the pavement.                                           
 In a pool of his own blood.                                             
 He pulls himself up.                                                   
 Thugs arrive from the stairs.                                          
 Swarm around him.

                 Never mind me. Get after him. Kill that son of a bitch.
                                                                       
 Payne has enough strength to bellow like a wounded bull                
 It costs him.                                                          
 He has to be helped to his feet.                                         
 The thugs race for cars which appear immediately.                      
 Payne is helped into one.                                              
 They roar off in pursuit.

 A hard decision for Jeff....

 The doors burst open.                                                    
 Two thugs firing automatic weapons just to announce their presence.      
 They shatter sacred, precious crockery --                                 
 But hit nobody.                                                           
 Jeff turns and shoots both of them.                                      
 Exhausting all the bullets in his clip.

 He's on his feet.                                                                
                                                                                 
                                                     LEE                          
                                  You take care of her --                          
                                                                                 
 He embraces Jenny.                                                               
                                                                                 
                                                LEE                               
                         Bye, Jenny.                                              
                                                                                 
 Jeff and Lee shake hands.                                                        
                                                                                 
                                                JEFF                              
                         Your story might look better to the police if you were
                         UNCONSCIOUS.                                           
                                                                                 
                                                LEE                               
                         Oh shit...                                               
                                                                                 
 Jeff suddenly HITS him again over the head with the gun --                        
 Lee slumps back to the ground.                                                   
 Jeff takes Jenny by the hand                                                     
 And they walk out the back of the temple...                                      
                                                                                 
                                                                         DISSOLVE:

 4/6/92 D.G., W.H.                            112.
                                                   
 EXT. SOUTH CHINA SEA - DAWN                        
                                                   
 A small boat clears the harbor.                     
 Sails out to sea.                                  
 Jeff at the tiller.                                
 Jenny next to him.                                 
 Her hair blowing slightly in the wind.               
                                                   
                                           FADE OUT:
                                                   
                                  THE END
