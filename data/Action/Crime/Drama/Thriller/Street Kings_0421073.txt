NIGHT WATCH
"Pilot"
TEASER

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

TwO MEN in their early twenties, JIMMY PATTERSON and TONY
BUTLER, walk down a sidewalk in the Meat Packing District.
Funky hole-in-the-wall bars butt up against graffiti covered
steel shutters protecting closed storefronts. There are few
other people on the streets at this hour: Hipsters heading
out to begin their night, while the homeless hunker down.
Late night delivery trucks rumble down the street.

Both Jimmy and Tony are dressed down in the latest hip grunge-
wear. There's a lot of pent-up energy crackling around these
guys, especially Tony, who's twitching like roach caught in

a trap.

TONY
Jimmy, I'm jonesin' hard. We've gotta
make a stop.

JIMMY
Wait on it. We're already late.

TONY
I'm telling you, I need a taste now

Tony's serious.

JIMMY
Okay, fine. But we make it quick.

CUT TO:

EXT. NONDESCRIPT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jimmy and a SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE, of varying ages and
ethnicities mill around, smoking cigarettes. They are all
waiting for an unmarked, but heavily secured door to open.
Tony is still twitching.

JIMMY
Man, what's the hold-up tonight?

WAITING MAN
Always like this on Fridays. Everyone
waits till the last minute.

The door opens and Tony steps out. The Waiting Man hurriedly
pushes past him into the building.

TONY
You ready?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 2.

JIMMY
I'm set.

TONY
Let's go.

As Tony and Jimmy walk away from the building, Tony reaches
inside his jacket. Jimmy grabs his arm.

JIMMY

You're not gonna do it here?
TONY

You watch me.
JIMMY

Not cool.

He scans the street, sees an alley, shielded from the
streetlights.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Over there, c'mon.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Tony hurries into the shadows with Jimmy a few steps behind.
They side-step the usual assortment of overflowing garbage
cans. A few scavenging rats scurry away from their
interrupted meals.

JIMMY
Dude, shouldn't be this bad. You're
waiting too long between hook-ups.

TONY
Now you're the expert? I've been
doing this longer than you.

JIMMY
What can I say? I'm a natural.

Tony snorts derisively as he reaches inside his jacket to
pull out something wrapped in PLAIN BROWN PAPER. He tears
open the paper. Inside is not drugs, but a CLEAR, HOSPITAL-
STYLE BAG FILLED WITH A RED, VISCOUS LIQUID. It looks
suspiciously like BLOOD.

Tony opens his mouth to reveal TWO SHARP, OVERLY LONG CANINE
TEETH. He BITES INTO THE BAG and a BLISSFUL LOOK spreads
across his face as he GREEDILY GULPS down the blood.

Seeing Tony's obvious, almost sexual satisfaction, Jimmy
can't resist. He pulls out a similar bag of blood.

But just as he's about to bite into his, Tony GAGS.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 3.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
(jokes)
What'd your mamma say about gulping
your food?

But Tony isn't laughing. He begins to CHOKE, then RETCHES
UP RED FLUID.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Tony, take it easy! What's wrong
with you?

As Jimmy looks on in horror, Tony begins to VIOLENTLY
CONVULSE. He FALLS FACE FIRST to the ground, his body FLAILING
WILDLY.

Jimmy grabs Tony, rolls him over onto his back. Tony's
face is a mask of shock and fear. A SMALL CRIMSON TRICKLE
OF BLOOD runs down his chin. Tony blinks rapidly as his
EYES TURN RED, filling with blood. Then, with a final,
PINKISH, FROTHY COUGH, it's over. Tony's hand, still
clutching the plastic bag, falls to his side. His red eyes
now stare sightlessly at the black night sky above.

Jimmy staggers back...

JIMMY (CONT'D)
(completely freaked)
Tony... Oh, man, oh man...

He looks down at the bag of blood he's still holding in his
hand. Then, looks back toward the building from where he
and Tony just came. From this distance, we can now see a
brightly lit sign on the side of the building. It reads:
CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK.

Jimmy drops his untouched bag of blood. It falls onto the
ground next to Tony's lifeless body as Jimmy turns and runs
first awkwardly, than faster, faster, down the alley, away
from his dead friend...

CUT TO:
EXT. ALLEY - DAWN

A number UNIFORMED COPS mill around, putting up crime scene
tape, comparing notes. A CRIME SCENE TECH snaps a few final
photos of the dead vampire, before covering it with a tarp.

A sea of HUMAN GAWKERS, straining their necks for a glimpse
of gore from behind the tape, suddenly part for ALEXANDRA
CANTARA, a Classically beautiful young woman in her mid-
twenties. Although in civilian dress, she carries herself
with a definite air of authority.

Alex quickly makes her way to the front of the gathered crowd.
Flashing her badge, she fluidly ducks beneath the gaudy yellow
police tape and is met by DETECTIVE DARNELL HARVEY.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 4.

Mid-thirties, tall, with a solid, muscular build. A career
cop you'd want at your back in a dark alley at night.

DARNELL
Morning, Alex.

ALEX
Darnell. What've we got?

DARNELL
Dead Vampire.

Alex follows Darnell to a tarp-covered body. They both pull
on LATEX GLOVES. Alex pulls the tarp back to reveal Tony,
still lying face up in what is now a pool of cold, congealed
blood. She scans the body.

ALEX
Poor kid.

DARNELL
He wasn't staked. No signs of any
struggle. Just lots of regurgitated

blood.
ALEX

Like the Vampire we found last week.
DARNELL

That's what I was thinking too.
ALEX

Damn.

(beat)

You smell anything?

DARNELL
Just death.

Alex notices the empty blood bag clutched in Tony's hand.

ALEX
The Canal Street Blood Bank is right
around the corner.

Darnell holds up an ID card.

DARNELL
Yeah, this was in his wallet. Name
was Tony Butler. Registered with the
city for weekly withdrawals.

Alex picks up the still full bag of blood laying beside Tony.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07

ALEX
One bag per customer which means
another Vampire was here. Let's get
this blood tested.

Darnell takes the bag and puts it in an evidence envelope.

DARNELL
And I'll run the bag's serial number
against the blood bank's records.
See if I get a name. You think this
other Vamp is our killer?

ALEX
Vampires don't kill each other like
this. And why would he take off and
leave a full bag of blood behind?
Especially one we can trace.

Alex looks at Tony's hand clutching the empty bag.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Unless he was afraid of it...

DARNELL
You think something in the blood
killed this guy?

A dark, concerned expression washes over Alex's face.

ALEX
The City's blood supply has always
been safe. But if someone's found a
way to tamper with it...

DARNELL
The Vampires will stop going to the
blood banks. They'll have to find
other sources for their fix.

ALEX
Human sources. The Vampires will
start hunting again.

The Camera pans up and out of the alley, and we catch a
glimpse of Alex's city, New York City...

END OF TEASER
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 6.
ACT ONE
INT. 6TH PRECINCT, DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY

A large open room, filled with about a dozen or so desks
all groaning under stacks of paperwork. File cabinets line
the walls. Dry erase boards list active cases.

It's a typically busy day and the bureau is filled with the
usual gathering of UNIFORMED COPS, PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVES
and A MOTLEY CREW OF SUSPECTS. But as the camera pans through
the room, we see there is something very different about a
few of the civilians:

A MAN, dressed in a business suit, answering a detective's
questions, has YELLOW EYES WITH OVAL CAT-LIKE PUPILS.
(A Shapeshifter )

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN gives a tearful statement to another
detective. She absentmindedly pushes back her long blonde
hair to reveal AN EAR WITH A POINTED TIP (A Fairy).

A STOCKY AND OVERLY HAIRY MAN in handcuffs, complains angrily
as he's led to a holding cell. (A Troll)

The Camera finds Alex and Darnell as they enter and cross
paths with DETECTIVE STERN, a career cop so horribly obnoxious
he should be in parking enforcement.

STERN
Hey, Cantara, heard another
bloodsucker bit the dust.

ALEX
I'll be sure to extend your sympathies
to his family.

STERN
Don't get all snotty. Just cause
I've got a real job and you're stuck
chasing night crawlers

DARNELL
A crime is a crime, Stern. Everyone's
equal under the law.

STERN
I remember a time when you didn't
give a rat's ass about non-Human
rights, Darnell.

DARNELL
Things change.

DETECTIVE
Guess you should know.
(MORE )
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 7.

DETECTIVE (CONT'D)
I'm just surprised she talked you
into joining the SCD. Didn't the K-
9 Unit have an open spot?

Darnell moves toward Stern like he's going to clock him one,
but Alex quickly steps between the two men.

ALEX
(to Darnell)
Go pull the paperwork on the first
dead vampire.

As Darnell moves off, Alex gives Stern a filthy look that
sends him on his way too.

Alex continues on through the room, but this exchange hasn't
escaped the attention of CHIEF ALBERT KINCAID, a been there,
seen that, cop in his late forties. Dealing more with
politicians than criminals now, his waistline has softened,
his fixity of purpose has not.

He intercepts Alex and they continue walking together

KINCAID
You want me to talk to Stern?

ALEX
Don't waste the oxygen.
(beat)
I need you to shut down the Canal
Street Blood Bank. I've got a Vampire
who died after ingesting blood from
there.

KINCAID
Closing the bank is going to make
people very nervous.

ALEX
Well, it's making me nervous too.
(lowering her voice)
The Vampire today looked a lot like
the one we found last week.

KINCAID
And you think there's something in
the city's blood supply?

ALEX
It's possible.

KINCAID
All right. I'll make the call. But
this is going to bring a lot of heat
down on us.

(MORE )
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 8.

KINCAID (CONT'D)
Just rumors of tainted blood will
start a panic. It's hard enough to
get Humans and Vampires to trust
each other in the best of times.

ALEX
I can handle it.

KINCAID
Alex, I've known you since you were
sixteen and I've never heard you say
anything but 'I can handle it'.

ALEX
And I always do.

KINCAID
But you don't have to do it all by
yourself. Why can't you admit
sometimes you need help?

ALEX
From some bigoted jar-head like Stern?
No thanks.

KINCAID

Don't worry, I don't think Stern's
volunteering. In fact, no one is.
You need another cop on your squad,
Alex. Have you thought any more
about Detective Fletcher?

ALEX
The guy from Phoenix?

KINCAID
He's a first rate cop and willing to
transfer to New York just to work
with you on the SCD.

ALEX
Why?

KINCAID
Ask him yourself.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, KINCAID'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kincaid opens the door to his office and strides in. Alex
follows to find CAMPBELL FLETCHER waiting.

Campbell is a very handsome man in his late twenties with an
athletic build and the cocky stance of someone very sure of
himself and his abilities.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07

KINCAID
Detective Campbell Fletcher meet
Detective Alexandra Cantara, head of
the Supernatural Crimes Division.

As Kincaid takes a seat behind his desk, Campbell extends a
hand to Alex.

CAMPBELL
(turning on the charm)
I've heard a lot about you, Detective.

He gives Alex a smile, it's a charming smile, but Alex is
really not in the mood to be charmed. So, she ignores him.

ALEX
When I set up this squad you promised
no interference.

KINCAID
I said minimal interference.

ALEX
Hiring people behind my back is major
Major interference.

Campbell gives a little wave to get their attention.

CAMPBELL
Hello? I'm sitting right here.

ALEX
Detective Fletcher, do you have any
idea what you're signing up for?

CAMPBELL
As a matter of fact I do. Before I
joined the force in Phoenix, I got
my Master's degree in preternatural
sociology. I've done extensive
studies in non-Human criminology...

ALEX
And how many non-Humans did you
actually encounter out there in sunny
Arizona?

CAMPBELL
Not many, but that's why I'm here.

ALEX
That's what I thought.

CAMPBELL
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 10.

ALEX
Wrong, Detective. What you're sensing
is skepticism. I don't meet many
cops so willing to volunteer for
"Spook Squad" duty.

CAMPBELL
Obviously you volunteered.

KINCAID
He's got a point.

Alex can't believe Kincaid has blindsided her like this.
They lock eyes. Alex realizes this is a fight she won't
win.

ALEX
(to Campbell)
Fine, but this is my game. You play
by my rules.

CAMPBELL
Got it.

Campbell exits. As Alex also leaves, Kincaid stops her.

KINCAID
You can't run this show all by
yourself, Alex. I'm ordering you to
give him a chance.

ALEX
A chance to get himself killed?

She slams the door behind her
INT. 6TH PRECINCT, AUTOPSY ROOM #2 - LATER

Alex and Campbell enter to find DOCTOR RICHARD HUNTER pulling
on a latex glove. He stands in front of an examination table
on which Tony's naked body lays. An ARRAY of SURGICAL
IMPLEMENTS, some familiar some not, rest on a nearby tray.

ALEX
Hey Doc.

HUNTER
Alex. I thought Darnell was coming
down?

ALEX

Why should he have all the fun?
This is Detective Fletcher. He's
going to be working with us on this
case. Fletcher, this is Doctor
Hunter, best coroner in the city.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 11.

Hunter nods hello, but Campbell only has eyes for Tony's
corpse. In death, Tony's mouth hangs slightly open and the
tips of his fangs glint in the overhead light.

Hunter reaches down and pulls Tony's lips back to reveal
even more fang.

HUNTER
I took a dental mold to confirm his
I.D. Bite imprint matches Tony
Butler's registration records.

Hunter closes Tony's mouth again and snaps on a second glove.

HUNTER (CONT'D)
Ever attended a Vampire autopsy
before, Detective Fletcher?

CAMPBELL
(not worried)
First time for everything.

Hunter shoots Alexandra a look as he picks up a very sharp
SCALPEL.

ALEX
Don't worry, doc. Fletcher here has
a masters degree in preternatural
anthropology.

Hunter shrugs and brings the scalpel to Tony's chest. He
presses down to make the first cut and...

Suddenly, Tony's body CONVULSES and a THICK STREAM OF BLACK
GOO ERUPTS from the incision, bubbling up like a mini-geyser
before falling back onto his chest with a squishy SPLAT.

Campbell turns green, in fact, a number of different greens
each shade more and more impressively sickly, but he holds
his ground. Dr. Hunter looks at him knowingly,

HUNTER
The first cut's the deepest.

Just a little Coroner humor and Alex brings her hand to her
mouth to keep from laughing at Campbell's reaction.

ALEX
It's bad form to puke on the corpse.

Campbell swallows a few times.

CAMPBELL
What is that stuff?

Hunter takes a long cotton swab of the equipment tray and
dips the end into the black goo.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 12.

ALEX
It's the virus that turns Humans
into Vampires.

CAMPBELL
(back on solid ground)
Once introduced, the virus completely
overwhelms the Human immune system,
re-creating the host in its own image,
until, viola, you're a Vampire.

Hunter smears a small glass slide with the swab and moves to
a nearby microscope. Placing the slide on the stage, he
peers through the eyepiece.

HUNTER
A very painful process.

CAMPBELL
And a purposeful one. A Vampire has
to choose to infect the Human and
there's no guarantee the Human will
even survive the transformation.

MICROSCOPIC VIEW

 

The Vampire Virus in the goo resembles Human blood cells
but the platelets are black with a slightly different
geometry. We see a BACTERIUM smother one of the healthy
Vampire blood cells, destroying it.

BACK TO SCENE

HUNTER
I found the same blood-borne infection
in the Vampire you brought in last
week. Some kind of bacterial toxin
that suffocates healthy Vampire
hemoglobin.

Alex takes a look under the microscope.

HUNTER (CONT'D)

It was also present in the empty bag
you found, but in a dormant state.
It doesn't seem to attack Human
hemoglobin, just Vampire.

ALEX
And our first victim was found in
his apartment with a half-empty cup
of blood next to him.

CAMPBELL
Could it have gotten into the blood
supply by accident?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 13.

HUNTER
All the blood distributed by the
blood banks is cloned from genetically
altered cells resistant to toxemia.
This had to be introduced later.

ALEX
So it was deliberate.

HUNTER
I'm sending samples to the National
Preternatural Sciences Lab in D.C.
for further testing.

ALEX
Doc...

HUNTER
Alex, you don't have to tell me you
need the results yesterday.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, SCD OFFICES - DAY

Alex, Kincaid, Darnell and Campbell sit around a conference
table. Case files and papers are strewn amongst styrofoam
coffee cups and soda cans.

ALEX
Two victims dead after drinking
contaminated blood from the city's
blood supply.

DARNELL
Victim number one, John Knox. Made
a withdrawal from the East 70th Street
Blood Bank the night he died. Victim
number two, Tony Butler. Got his
blood from the Canal Street Bank

CAMPBELL
Anything to connect them?

DARNELL

Just that they were Vampires. Tony
was an unemployed "actor" who arrived
in New York a few weeks ago. Knox
was an investment strategist who

lived on the Upper East Side. I talked
to Knox's neighbors and co-workers.
Guy didn't socialize much, rarely
strayed south of the Plaza Hotel.

ALEX
What about the full bag of blood we
found next to Tony?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 14.

DARNELL
Pulled a usable print and checked it
against the registry.

Darnell refers to a piece of paper in front of him.

DARNELL (CONT'D)
Withdrawn by one Jimmy Patterson
same time Tony was there. But it
tested clean. No toxin.

CAMPBELL
He didn't stick around, try to help
a fellow Vampire?

DARNELL
He probably just freaked. Jimmy's a
minor league punk recently turned
Vamp. Petty criminal with a couple
of outstanding warrants.

ALEX
A lot of Vampires still don't trust
the police.

DARNELL

I got an APB out on him.

KINCAID
Tell 'em to keep a low profile. I
want to keep a lid on this as long
possible.

ALEX
If there's no connection between our
victims, the poisonings were random.
Done by someone who wasn't too
particular about their target.

KINCAID
We got a lot of hate groups out there.
Start digging, see who could pull
something like this off.

DARNELL
I'm on it.

Darnell gathers up his files and heads out. Kincaid's CELL
PHONE RINGS.

KINCAID
(into phone)
Kincaid.
(listens)
Right.

He hangs up and looks at Alex.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 15.

KINCAID (CONT'D)
Next problem.

CUT TO:
EXT. CITY HALL - AFTERNOON

Alex and Campbell exit their car and find themselves in the
middle of a chaotic HUMAN'S FIRST RALLY. Hundreds of people
surround City Hall. Some carry signs: "NON-HUMANS = NON-
PEOPLE"; "HUMANS FIRST, HUMANS ONLY"; "REPEAL THE NON-HUMAN
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT NOW!!". Police barricades have established
a perimeter to keep the Human Protesters away from a vocal
and growing number of non-Human counter-protesters. AS
slogans are chanted and slurs thrown back and forth, anger
on both sides builds, threatening to boil over at any moment.

ALEX
Humans First is a New York-based
group...

CAMPBELL

...O0f racists who believe all non-
Humans should be exterminated.

As Alex looks approvingly at Campbell.

ALEX
You have done your homework

As Alex and Campbell wade through the crowd, they're
approached by CHASE DESMOND, a stunning woman in her late
twenties, a sexy, professional, dresser who knows how to get
what she wants. A PRESS BADGE hangs around her neck.

CHASE
Hey Alex.

ALEX
Detective Campbell Fletcher this is
Chase Desmond, a reporter for the
Times.

Campbell smiles warmly at this alluring woman.

CAMPBELL
You cover a lot of these protests?

CHASE
Unfortunately they're news.

A commotion in the crowd draws Chase's attention.

CHASE (CONT'D)
I'll catch you later.

As Chase disappears into the crowd, Alex catches sight of
two men making their way toward her.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 16.

ALEX
Wonderful.

JACK KEMP, a charismatic, Donald Trump-like businessman in

his 50s approaches. He is trailed by MARK DALI, 30s, a smarmy
corporate type with a permanent smirk on his handsome, but
cold face.

KEMP.
Alex, darling, how are you? It's
been far too long...

ALEX
Not long enough, Jack.
(to Campbell)
This is Jack Kemp, head of the Humans
First movement and Mark Dali, his
lap dog.

Dali bristles.

DALI
This is a legitimate gathering,
Detective Cantara. We're protected
by the First Amendment.

ALEX
And non-Humans are protected by the
28th Amendment.

DALI
The Non-Humans Civil Rights Act should
never have been passed. And we'll
do everything in our power to repeal
it.

ALEX
Not going to happen today, Dali.
(to Kemp)
What's all this about, Jack?

KEMP.
The Human community is very concerned
about the two Vampires recently
killed. Concerned the Vampires will
use them as an excuse to return to
their old ways.

ALEX
The second Vampire died less than
twelve hours ago. No one has had
time to get very concerned. Unless
Humans First somehow anticipated it
happening?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 17.

DALI
How dare you! Mr. Kemp is a highly
respected community leader...

KEMP.
It's alright, Mark, I'm sure Alex
didn't mean anything. She's always
been very passionate about her causes.

ALEX
You're using those dead Vampires to
spread fear and paranoia.

KEMP.
If the NYPD is going to continue
putting the rights of "Monsters"
ahead of Humans, it's up to people
like me to ensure the Human majority
has a voice.

CAMPBELL
Even if that voice calls for the
slaughter of all non-Humans?

KEMP.
I didn't get your name, Detective?

CAMPBELL
Fletcher, Campbell Fletcher.

KEMP.
A word of advice, Detective Fletcher.
A battle is coming, choose your side
very carefully.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Campbell drives, Alex, lost in thought, in the passenger
seat.

CAMPBELL
What's the story with you and Kemp?

ALEX
He was friends with my parents.

CAMPBELL
But your mother and father were on
the front lines of the Non-Human
Civil Rights Movement?

ALEX
And Kemp's one of the planet's biggest
bigots? The irony isn't lost on me.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 18.

CAMPBELL
Your parents' study on Non-Human
Integration was one of the primary
sources for my Master's thesis.
(beat)
I'm sorry about what happened to
them.

ALEX
It was a long time ago.

CAMPBELL
And the police never found their
killers? That must be hard.

Campbell's compassion prompts Alex to make an unexpected
admission.

ALEX
Yeah. It was... It still is.

Alex looks at Campbell's profile for a long moment. Campbell
turns to see the carefully guarded pain in Alex's eyes.

There's a spark of a connection, but Alex breaks it...

ALEX (CONT'D)
Pull over up here. There's someone
I need to talk to.

As Campbell pulls the car to the curb

CAMPBELL
Need some back-up?

ALEX
Good night, Fletcher.

Alex exits the car in front of...
EXT. CLUB CARNAGE - CONTINUOUS

Stretching down the block is a red velvet rope holding in
check a long line of HOPEFUL ENTRANTS. A CROWD OF YOUNG,
CLUBBY TYPES are ignoring the queue, posing for the
unimpressed BOUNCER who stands in the doorway.

Alex moves confidently toward the club's entrance. She
bypasses the line and walks right up to the door. The Bouncer
doesn't speak, but to the chagrin of the posers, he moves
aside to let her pass. As she enters, we see a BRASS PLAQUE
on the door. It reads: CLUB CARNAGE.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Instead of leaving, Campbell watches Alex in his rear view
mirror until he sees Alex go inside the club. Then he pulls
the car over and parks.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 19.

INT. CLUB CARNAGE, LOUNGE - NIGHT

The décor of the main room is minimalist hipster cool. Sexy
shades of cobalt and purple dominate. Scandinavian designed
light fixtures cast a warm glow on the patrons. Low slung
modern couches are packed with drinkers. Another, larger
room has a DJ booth and dance floor filled with dancers.

Alex moves purposefully through the crowd to the bar.
AT THE BAR

Alex sits down on a stool and almost immediately a very dry,
Belvedere vodka martini with two olives is placed before her
by the beautiful, young, female BARTENDER.

Alex acknowledges it with a smile. As she raises her drink
to take a sip, a man suddenly appears behind her, whispers
in her ear...

CHRISTIEN
Hello, Sasha

ALEX
(without turning)
Hello, Christien.

We get our first look at CHRISTIEN as he sits down on the
stool next to Alex. He looks so innately dangerous he must
be non-Human, but so devastating attractive, you don't care.
A walking advertisement for the seductive pleasures of
vampirism,

CHRISTIEN
You look lovely as always.

ALEX
I'm here on business.

CHRISTIEN
That doesn't make your company any
less of a pleasure.

Christien reaches out to take Alex's hand. He kisses it
with a delicacy that makes Alex unintentionally shiver.

CHRISTIEN (CONT'D)
Come to my office. It's quieter.

Christen sweeps to his feet and Alex takes a final slug of
her drink (for courage?), before following him.

AT THE ENTRANCE

Campbell enters and takes in the scene, looking for Alex.
As he makes his way to the bar, the camera pans over to find
Jimmy (the Vampire from the Teaser).
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 20.

Jimmy prowls the room, looking hungry, a little dangerous.
He catches the eye of WENDY, a smokin' hot club chick about
his age. Jimmy smiles, he's found his hook-up for the night.

AT THE BAR

Campbell makes his way to the bar and grabs a seat.

BARTENDER
What's your poison?

CAMPBELL
Beer.

BARTENDER

I've never seen you here before.

CAMPBELL
You remember all your customers?

BARTENDER
Just the cute ones.

CAMPBELL
I'm new in town.

BARTENDER
Yum, fresh meat.

The Bartender places the beer in front of Campbell and smiles
while EXTENDING TWO VERY SHARP LONG FANGS. Whoa! That was
unexpected. Campbell looks around and now sees interspersed
with the painted-up human clubbers are Vampires.

Ditching his new friend with a somewhat nervous smile,
Campbell moves away from the bar and continues his search
for Alex.

CHRISTIEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Christien and Alex enter a room, filled with a mix of both
modern and antique furniture. Its style is both beautiful
and timeless, much like Christien.

Alex sits on the sumptuous couch as Christien moves to his
personal bar. He pours himself a glass of red wine (or maybe
it's blood) from a crystal decanter. As he mixes Alex another
martini...

 

CHRISTIEN
Olives, right?

ALEX
You know me too well.

CHRISTIEN
I would say, not nearly well enough.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 21.

Christien brings Alex her drink and sits down next to her.
Anxious to change the subject...

ALEX
I assume you've heard about the
tainted blood?

CHRISTIEN
News travels fast in the Vampire
community.

ALEX

That's what I'm afraid of.

CHRISTIEN
The police are worried Vampires will
stop going to the banks and start
attacking Humans.

ALEX
Pretty much.

CHRISTIEN
Well, I'm worried that someone is
using the blood banks to launch
unprovoked attacks against my people.

ALEX
We're going to find out who's
responsible.

CHRISTIEN
Forgive me if I find it hard to
believe the police are giving this
top priority.

ALEX

I'm giving it top priority. But I
need your help. As leader of the
Vampire community in New York, you
have the power to keep this contained.
We've already shut down two banks

and we're running tests at the others.
Tell your people not to hunt.

CHRISTIEN
They're scared, they may not listen.

ALEX
Oh, please. There isn't a Vampire
in this City that would dare disobey
you.

CHRISTIEN
And in return for my help?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 22.

ALEX
Preventing an all out war between
Humans and Vampires isn't enough?
(beat)
Fine. What do you want?

Christien just sits, staring at Alex. She wonders what he's
thinking. She's sure she wouldn't like it. Well, not sure
but pretty sure.

CHRISTIEN
I'll have to think about it.

ALEX
Well, don't take too long.

Alex stands to leave.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Christien, until we're sure about
the blood... Be careful.

CHRISTIEN
I don't take blood from the banks.

ALEX
No, I suppose you don't have problems
finding consensual donors.
Particularly of the female persuasion.

CHRISTIEN
Jealous, Sasha?

ALEX
Not my scene.

CHRISTIEN
There are fringe benefits.

Alex is sure there are. But their conversation is interrupted
when the Bartender runs into the room.

BARTENDER
Christien, you better come. There's
a fight.

CHRISTIEN
(stunned)
A fight? Here?

ALEX
This I have to see.

INT. LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

Alex and Christien arrive to find shocked club patrons
watching as Campbell and one of Christien's BODYGUARDS
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 23.

struggle. Or rather Campbell is struggling, the Bodyguard,
is on top of Campbell, PUMMELING him.

Alex's GUN is immediately out, cocked and hovering inches
from the Bodyguard's ear

ALEX
Get off him.

The Bodyguard looks toward Christien for guidance. Almost
too fast for the Human eye to see, Christien GRABS the
Bodyguard and YANKS him way from Campbell.

ALEX (CONT'D)
(to Christien)
Thanks.

Christien casually TOSSES the Bodyguard aside like an empty
candy wrapper.

CHRISTIEN
Good help is so hard to find.

ALEX
Tell me about it.

Campbell bristles at Alex's words and tone.

CAMPBELL
I thought you might need help.

ALEX
If I need help, I'll ask for it.

CAMPBELL
I doubt that.

ALEX
I won't tolerate this macho-defender
crap from you, Fletcher!

CAMPBELL
And I won't tolerate being treated
like some wet-behind-the-ears rookie.

ALEX
Then stop acting like one.

They suddenly fall silent as they realize Christien is
intently watching their bickering as someone would follow a
tennis match.

CHRISTIEN
No please, Sasha, don't stop on my
account. This is most entertaining.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 24.

CAMPBELL
Why is it that every Vampire runs a
nightclub? Don't you think it's a
little cliché?

CHRISTIEN
Not many establishments remain open
all night. Can you see me behind
the counter at your local Seven-
Eleven?

Campbell's not done with Christien, but Alex cuts him off...

ALEX
Thank you for your time, Christien.

We don't see him move, but suddenly Christien stands in front
of Alex. Looking deep into her eyes...

CHRISTIEN
You are welcome here anytime, Sasha

He eyes a steaming Campbell.

CHRISTIEN (CONT'D)
But, perhaps you should find a
playmate with better manners.

Alex quickly ushers Campbell across the room, practically
pushing him out an emergency exit door...

EXT. CLUB CARNAGE - CONTINUOUS

CAMPBELL
Head of Humans First, leader of the
Vampire Community, you keep some
pretty funky company, Detective.

ALEX
Are you purposely trying to get
yourself killed?

CAMPBELL
I can take care of myself.

ALEX
Yeah, I could tell by the way you
got the crap beaten out of you.

CAMPBELL

Who do you think you are?
ALEX

Back off.
CAMPBELL

Why? Tell me why and I will.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 25.

ALEX
(beyond frustrated)
Because people who do this job die.
And I don't want to be responsible
for that!

CAMPBELL
Who died?

Alex takes a deep breath. She can't believe she's even
getting into this. But... there's something about the way
Campbell is looking at her. Something that suddenly makes
her want him to understand.

ALEX
Mike Wells. We went to the Academy
together. We were close.
(smiling sadly)
He joined the SCD because he believed
in what I was trying to do. He joined
because he believed in me.

CAMPBELL
What happened?

ALEX
We found out someone in the Fairy
Court was trafficking illegal weapons.
Mike went to meet an informant.
Rangers found him two days later.
Dead, entombed in a tree in Central
Park.

CAMPBELL
A tree?

ALEX
The Fairies wanted to send a message.

CAMPBELL
It's not your fault. He was a cop.
He knew the score.

ALEX
That doesn't make it any easier.

For just a moment, there's something in the open, unguarded
way she's looking at him that threatens to take Campbell's
breath away. But then, it's over, leaving Campbell to wonder
if it even happened.

ALEX (CONT'D)
And I won't let it happen again.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 26.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT

Jimmy and Wendy, the beautiful girl we saw him with earlier,
stand in a dark corner of a parking lot down the street from
Club Carnage. They're making out against a parked car

After a few passionate kisses, Jimmy pulls back.

JIMMY
You know what I want...

Wendy pulls her hair back to expose her neck. The white
skin almost gleams in the dark.

WENDY
I'm told I'm very tasty.

Jimmy extends his fangs, bites into her jugular. He starts
to drink. Ecstasy overcomes them both, until...

WENDY (CONT'D)
Okay, that's enough, Jimmy.

But, Jimmy can't stop. He's too hungry. He continues to
greedily suck at Wendy's neck

WENDY (CONT'D)
I'm serious. You're taking too much!

Wendy tries to squirm away, but Jimmy is too strong. We see
his EYES FILL WITH BLOOD.

Off Wendy as she begins to SCREAM...
END OF ACT ONE
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 27.

ACT Two
EXT. PARKING LOT - MORNING

UNIFORMS survey the crime scene as Alex and Darnell check
out Wendy's body with a CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATOR. Wendy's
body has a DISTINCT PALE PALLOR. TWO DEEP PUNCTURE MARKS on
her neck are plainly visible.

cSI
Judging by rigor and liver temp, I'd
put time of death around 4 AM. Cause
of death was exsanguination. She
was drunk dry.

ALEX
Get an impression of the puncture
wounds. Hopefully our perp's dental
molds are on file.

Alex and Darnell step aside as the CSI signals for a gurney
to take the body away.

DARNELL
It's been months since a Vampire
killed a Human like this.

ALEX
I just can't believe it happened so
close to the Club.

DARNELL
Think we're looking for a hungry
Vamp too scared to go to the blood
banks?

ALEX
A Vampire more scared of the banks
than he is of Christien? That's
pretty damn scared. Something isn't
right here.

Darnell looks over to Campbell who's a short distance away
talking to a short man.

DARNELL
How's it going with Fletcher?

ALEX
A master's degree is no substitute
for experience.

DARNELL
I wasn't exactly an expert in non-
Humans when you recruited me.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 28.

ALEX
That was different and you know it.

DARNELL
I still think you should cut Campbell
some slack. We can use all the help
we can get right now.

ALEX
I know. I'm trying.

At Darnell's look.

ALEX (CONT'D)
I am.
(changing the subject)
Make sure the CSIs get a cast of
Wendy's puncture wounds. Maybe our
perp's fang molds are in the system.

Alex moves away.
WITH CAMPBELL

Campbell interrogates a TROLL who stands next to a large
garbage dumpster. A makeshift tent made of plastic bags and
cardboard, and the clutter around it, indicates the Troll's
been camping out here for a while.

CAMPBELL
You must've seen something.

TROLL
We don't like to get involved. This
is a Human thing, a Vampire thing.
Not a Troll thing.

CAMPBELL
I'm going to make this a "Troll thing"
unless you start cooperating.

TROLL
(reluctantly)
Maybe I saw something.

CAMPBELL
The girl and the Vampire?

TROLL
I saw them leave the club. Head off
together. That's all I remember

 

CAMPBELL
Think you'll remember more down at
the station?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 29.

After a beat, the Troll reaches into his tent and pulls out
a PURSE. Campbell practically grabs it from him.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Is this the girl's purse? Did you
steal this?

TROLL
I found it. Later. After. She
didn't need it anymore.

CAMPBELL
Are you kidding me?

Alex approaches.

ALEX
(to the Troll)
Go see Detective Harvey. Give him
your Guild Name in case we need to
talk to you again.

The Troll stalks off, mumbling under his breath.

CAMPBELL
We should take him in.

ALEX
Trolls have a very set view of
"finders-Keepers". He doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

Campbell begins to search the purse's contents.

ALEX (CONT'D)
This happened just a few hours after
we left the Club.

CAMPBELL
Your Vampire friend seemed kind of
pissed. Could he be involved?

ALEX
Christien? Not a chance.
(beat)
And we're not friends.

CAMPBELL
Then what are you?

ALEX
None of your business.

CAMPBELL
Why does he call you 'Sasha'?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 30.

ALEXANDRA

It's a nickname for Alexandra.
CAMPBELL

Can I call you Sasha?
ALEXANDRA

No.
CAMPBELL

What makes Christien so special?

ALEX
Just that he's the oldest, most
powerful Vampire in New York.

CAMPBELL
Good point.

Campbell pulls an ID out of the purse.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Our dead girl is one Wendy Williams.
I've got her address.

ALEX
Take Darnell and check out her
apartment.

Alex's cell phone rings. She opens it.

ALEX (CONT'D)
This is Detective Cantara.

MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
This is Bill White from the Canal
Street Blood Bank. I've been going
through my records like you asked.
I think I found something...

ALEX
I'll be right there.

INT. CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK, HALLWAY - DAY

Alex walks with BILL SMITH, a young, ernest, overworked civil
servant-type who also happens to be a Vampire

BILL
I was going over the delivery invoices
from last week and I came across
some discrepancies.

He opens the door to...
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 31.

INT. CANAL STREET BLOOD BANK, BILL WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

MARTY GIBSON, a beefy Teamster with an attitude sits
impatiently. He doesn't want to be there.

BILL
Detective Cantara, this is Marty
Gibson.

ALEX
What do you do here, Marty?

MARTY
I'm a driver.

BILL
Marty picks up the blood bags from
the processing facilities and
distributes them to banks throughout
the city.

MARTY
I don't know why you're making such
a big deal out of this. Blood is
blood. The Vamps don't care where
they get it.

ALEX
You Human, Marty?

MARTY
Yeah. But I don't have a problem
with Non-Humans if that's where you're
goin'. Hell, my sister's dating a
Shifty. Had him over for barbecue
just last week.

ALEX
How very PC of you.

BILL
We're supposed to receive our allotted
supply of blood from the processing
facility in Trenton every Thursday.
Last week, Marty didn't make his
pick-up.

ALEX
What happened Marty?

MARTY
I was running behind. You know what
the traffic's like going through the
tunnel? I wasn't going to make my
day.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07

BILL
So, you gave us blood meant for the
Morningside Heights Bank.

MARTY
I made it up on my next run. It's
not like there was going to be run
on the stuff. Not with everything
that's been going on.

ALEX
Was the blood that killed Tony Butler
from that batch?

BILL
Yes.

ALEX
(to Marty)
Where'd you pick-up the blood you
delivered here?

MARTY
The plant out in Queens.

ALEX
(to Bill)
What other banks does that facility
supply to?

Bill takes a clipboard from his desk. Flips through the

pages...

BILL
Morningside Heights, Times Square,
East 70th Street...

ALEX
The East 70th Street Bank? That's
where the first victim got his blood.
Both Knox and Tony's blood came from
the same plant...

INT. WENDY WILLIAMS APARTMENT - DAY

32.

A typically tiny New York apartment shared by two young women.

Ikea, futons, more clothes than closet space.

Campbell sits on a small futon couch with Wendy's roommate,

SHANNON KELLY, an adorable girl in her early 20s.

She gazes deeply into Campbell's eyes as he desperately tries

to remember the questions he's supposed to be asking her

CAMPBELL
Anyway, Ms. Kelly, we were hoping...
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 33.

SHANNON
Please, call me Shannon.

CAMPBELL
Shannon. That's a beautiful name.

SHANNON
You're sweet.

Shannon puts a hand on Campbell's thigh and he breaks into a
sweat.

CAMPBELL
Thanks. But, um, we really need to
ask you some questions about Wendy.

SHANNON

Wouldn't you rather talk about me?
CAMPBELL

Or, maybe you could tell me a little

about you.

Campbell moves a little closer to Shannon. He's practically
panting. Darnell enters from the back bedroom.

DARNELL
(matter of fact)
Quit it with the Glamour Shannon.
(to Campbell)
She's a Fairy. Using mind tricks to
seduce you.

Shannon breaks eye contact with Campbell who startles as if
suddenly woken from a day-dream, a very erotic daydream.

SHANNON
I was just messing around.

As Campbell collects himself.

DARNELL
You don't seem too upset about your
friend.

SHANNON

She wasn't my friend, just my
roommate. Besides I warned her
told her it was just a matter of
time. Wendy was always picking up
Vamps. She was starting to look
like a Human pincushion.

CAMPBELL
She let them bite her?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 34.

SHANNON
She was totally into it. Said it was
great buzz.

DARNELL
Was Wendy trying to become a Vampire?

SHANNON
No, I don't think she wanted to take
it that far.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY
Campbell and Darnell head back to their car.

CAMPBELL
Sorry about that in there. The
Glamour thing. I never had a Fairy
do that to me before.

DARNELL
(knowingly)
You liked it, didn't you?
CAMPBELL
It was... intense.
DARNELL

I almost woke up married once. But
you get hit enough, you can start
seeing past it, keep it from affecting
you so much.

Darnell and Campbell get in their car
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

CAMPBELL
You think Shannon was telling the
truth about Wendy being some kind of
Vampire groupie?

DARNELL
It's more common than you'd think.

CAMPBELL
I can't imagine letting someone do
that to me.

DARNELL
You couldn't imagine getting Glamoured
until a few minutes ago.

CAMPBELL
How'd did you end up involved with
all this non-Human stuff?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 35.

DARNELL
I don't like to talk about it.

Darnell starts up the car...
INT. BLOOD PROCESSING FACILITY - DAY

Alex and the FACILITY'S MANAGER, CURT SMITH, a 30-ish, shirt
and tie, put-upon managerial-type, tour the high-tech blood
processing facility. SECURITY CAMERAS are omnipresent, as
are ARMED SECURITY GUARDS. Every person they pass wears a
SECURITY BADGE.

ALEX
I've got two dead Vampires who drank
tainted blood processed at this
facility.

SMITH
We process over one thousand pints
of blood a day.

ALEX
And it's all cloned here on site?

SMITH
Yes, we extract the key elements of
human plasma from the milk of cows
that have had their plasma genes
replaced with human ones.

BLOOD CLONING LAB

Lab technicians dressed in medical scrubs, wearing protective
goggles, masks and gloves work extracting the compounds to
clone blood.

SMITH (CONT'D)
Of course, the cows don't live here.
But, the genetically altered milk is
brought here and the essential
proteins extracted to grow the cloned

plasma.

ALEX
I assume your employees are carefully
screened?

SMITH

You'd have an easier time getting a
job with the CIA.

BLOOD PROCESSING LAB

More TECHNICIANS supervise the BLOOD ANALYSIS PROCESS. This
involves large amounts of blood flowing through an intricate
network of tubes and through the spectrometers that check
the blood.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 36.

SMITH (CONT'D)
Every drop of blood is purified before
it's packaged.

BLOOD PACKAGING

Technicians man the BLOOD PACKAGING EQUIPMENT. Picture a
high-tech version of a bottling plant, with blood flowing
into individual plastic bags, which are sealed and bar coded.

SMITH (CONT'D)
Each bag of blood individually sealed
and bar coded.

ALEX
How are requests from the blood banks
processed?

BLOOD STORAGE

A large warehouse space. Armed guards stand ready. A robotic
arm moves along the shelves of stored blood, before stopping
and removing a container of individual blood bags.

SMITH
By computer. Requests are submitted
and an automated system pulls blood
lots for dispatch.

SMITH'S OFFICE
What it lacks in personality it makes up for in functionality.

ALEX
And the blood lots are distributed
randomly based on individual blood
bank requests?

SMITH
It's what guarantees freshness.

ALEX
Who's the last person to handle the
blood before it leaves for the banks?

SMITH
That would be me. As the Senior
Facility Manager, I supervise
everything from beginning to end.

ALEX
Then how did the toxin get into the
blood without you knowing about it?

SMITH
I have no idea.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 37.

ALEX
You can understand why that makes
you rather suspicious.

SMITH
You think I'm responsible for the
poisonings?

ALEX
You had the opportunity. Motive, I
don't know? Maybe you've got
something against Vampires. Maybe
Humans First put you up to it?

A smile plays across Smith's lips.

ALEX (CONT'D)
I say something funny?

Smith opens his mouth wide and EXTENDS HIS FANGS.

SMITH
I don't think I'm your man, Detective
Cantara.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, SCD OFFICES - DAY

Alex looks up from her computer screen as Chase Desmond
perches on the corner of Alex's desk

CHASE
You've got three more dead Vampires
in Brooklyn. And Blood Bank
withdrawals are down almost twenty
percent.

ALEX
Believe me, I know.

CHASE
You think Jack Kemp's Humans First
Movement is behind the poisonings?

ALEX
You know I can't comment on an on-
going investigation.

CHASE
I've got a source who says Christien
is losing control of the Vampires.
They're ready to hit the streets
whether he likes it or not.

ALEX
You can't go public with that.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 38.

CHASE
The public has a right to know if a
war is starting.

ALEX
Chase, whoever is doing this is
looking for publicity. Wants Humans
and Vampires afraid of each other.
Don't play into their hands.

Chase thinks about it for a long moment.

CHASE
Nothing's confirmed yet. I'll sit
on it until it is.
(sweetly)
If you promise me a scoop.

ALEX
Don't even think about trying to
glam me. I'm so not in the mood.

Chase pushes her hair back and we see the pointed ear, she's
a Fairy.

CHASE
Damn you're cranky. Fine, enough
business. As a friend, what can I
do?

ALEX
Besides the Vampires, what are the
other non-Humans thinking? Anything
going on I don't know about?

CHASE
Everyone's just mostly waiting to
see how it plays out. Consensus is
that Humans First is behind it and
they won't stop with the Vampires.

ALEX

Yeah, Darnell's been tracking the
hate groups. Humans First is the
only one organized enough to put
something like this together.

(beat)
A year ago, I wouldn't have thought
Kemp would try anything this extreme.
But ever since he hired Dali...

CHASE
Dali's got an ego, that's for sure.

ALEX
(surprised)
You know him?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 39.

CHASE
I did a piece on him right after he
moved here from Boston. He came on
to me big time.

ALEX
Did Dali know you were a Fairy?

CHASE
I don't hide it.

ALEX
Interesting.

INT. HUMANS FIRST HEADQUARTERS, DALI'S OFFICE - DAY

Mark Dali sits behind a meticulously neat and organized desk
in his well-appointed office. The walls are lined with
various Humans First propaganda posters. Across from him
sit TWO 20-SOMETHING, THUGY FOOT SOLDIERS of Humans First,
RICH and JEFF.

JEFF
Two more Humans were put in the
hospital last night. Attacked by
hungry Vamps.

DALI
The public will soon realize how
stupid they were to let blood suckers
walk amongst us. That's when we'll
call for the mass extermination of
all non-Humans.

RICH
Meanwhile, we just sit here?

DALI
I didn't say that. How would you
boys like to have a little fun
tonight?

JEFF
Always.

DALI
One of my informants has infiltrated
Club Carnage. I know who the filth
is that killed that poor girl the
other night. This is where you can
find him.

Dali slides a piece of paper across his desk toward Jeff.
RICH

We'll show him what we think of his
kind.

Dali smiles.
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A Single, enormous, open room, loft-like with high beamed
ceilings, brick walls and large steel windows opening on to
the rooftop beyond. At the far end of the room, a spiral
staircase winds its way up to a second level.

The front door opens and a weary Alex comes home to grab a
quick shower and change. Sleep would be nice, very nice...

About to reach for the lights, she suddenly whirls, gun out.
In the dim light, she makes out a figure sitting in a chair

ALEX
God. You almost got yourself shot!

Alex re-holsters her gun and turns on the light to reveal,

CHRISTIEN
That would've hurt.

ALEX
What are you doing here?

CHRISTIEN
I'm getting a lot of pressure to
call for a boycott of the blood banks.

ALEX
I'm getting squeezed too. Kemp and
Dali are turning this into a media
circus. Wendy's parents are pushing
the Mayor for a "Stake 'em first
ask questions later" investigation
into their daughter's death.

CHRISTIEN
I will find out which Vampire dared
to defy me and deal with him.
Personally.

ALEX
No, that's my job.

CHRISTIEN
There are Human matters and there
are Vampire matters, Sasha. Don't
confuse the two.

ALEX
Is that a threat?

CHRISTIEN
I hope not. For both our sakes.

And with that, he's gone, leaving Alex to wonder exactly
what he meant by that...

JEFF

Hey blood sucker.

JIMMY

I don't know what you're talking

about. Piss off.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 42.

JEFF
I think you do.

In a flash, Rich pulls out a STAKE. Jimmy's companions take
off. Across the park, Campbell and Darnell see what's
happening and break into a run.

JIMMY
(panicked)
Look, okay, I'm sorry. I took too
much but I couldn't help it. I was
so hungry. You gotta believe me
man, it was an accident...

Jimmy's words fall on deaf ears. Jeff and Rich POUNCE on
Jimmy, sending him sprawling to the ground.

JEFF
This is for Wendy.

Rich DRIVES the stake through Jimmy's heart, killing him
instantly. Darnell and Campbell pull guns as they run.

DARNELL
Police! Drop it!

But he can't get a shot, it's too dark. Jeff and Rich ignore
him and take off running. Darnell and Campbell reach Jimmy.
Darnell takes one look at the Vampire.

DARNELL (CONT'D)
He's gone.

They take off again after Jeff and Rich who have a pretty
good head start on our people. It doesn't look we'll be
able to catch up with them, until...

Mid-stride, DARNELL's body transforms as he SHAPESHIFTS INTO
A WEREWOLF. His eyes turn YELLOW as his jaw lengthens to
accommodate a set of LARGE, GNASHING, CANINE TEETH. His
arms and legs bulge with growing muscular bulk and his skin
sprouts heavy, coarse hair.

Now, a hybrid creature of RIPPLING MUSCLE and SLASHING CLAWS,
Darnell still runs on two legs, but much faster than any
Human. He quickly closes the gap between himself and Jeff
and Rich, leaving Campbell struggling to catch up.

EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS

Darnell has a terrified Jeff and Rich cornered and cowering.
He VICIOUSLY SNARLS, reveling in his POWERFUL JAWS and TEETH.

Campbell reaches them and manages to cover the two men with
his gun, but his hands are shaky and he's only got eyes for
the snarling creature that used to be Darnell...

ACT THREE
INT. 6TH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

A Spartan box of a room, small table, two chairs, walls bare.
Darnell, thick file in hand, circles the seated Rich.

Campbell stands in the Observation Room behind a two-way
mirror. He watches Darnell, fascinated. This is the same
man he saw transform into that creature last night?

DARNELL
Boston P.D. sent down you and your
buddy's files. Thick as a phone
books. Numerous arrests for assault,
inciting violence, concealed
weapons... Oh, and lookie here, you
did five years for manslaughter.

RICH
Stinkin' Troll got what was comin'
to him.

Darnell SLAPS Rich across the back of the head with his file.

DARNELL
Humans First must've been psyched to
recruit a bigot like you.

RICH
We're comin' after you and all your

Darnell gets in Rich's face. His eyes SHIFT-CHANGE, becoming
yellow. The eyes of a wolf.

He takes an involuntary step back from the window.
BACK TO SCENE
There's a knock at the door. Alex sticks her head inside.

ALEX
Darnell.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Darnell joins Alex and Campbell. He's calmed down. His
eyes are back to normal.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 44.

ALEX
Forensics report just came back.
Jimmy's fang molds match the cast
made of Wendy's puncture wounds.
Jimmy was Wendy's killer.

CAMPBELL
How did these two losers know that
before we did?

DARNELL
Humans First must've sent them out.
Kemp knows killing Jimmy would get
the Vampires riled up.

ALEX
But who gave Kemp his info? Nobody
in the Vampire community would give
up Jimmy to Kemp, that's for sure.

DARNELL
He's getting him information from
somewhere.

ALEX

This whole thing is starting to feel
very orchestrated. The poisonings,
Jimmy's murder. I feel like there's
a connection we're not seeing.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY
Kincaid intercepts Alex.

KINCAID
I got a report of another dead Vampire
in Staten Island. Did you get anything
from the two guys you brought in?

ALEX
Just that they're loyal foot soldiers
for Humans First.

KINCAID
The Mayor's Office is crawling up my
ass. Did you know Christien shut
down Club Carnage?

ALEX
(shocked)
No.

KINCAID
What does it mean?
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07

ALEX
That Christien isn't confident he
can control what goes on there. And
that's not good.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY

Campbell walks in to find Darnell pouring himself a cup of
coffee. As Campbell grabs a cup and waits, Darnell can't

help notice Campbell seems a little uncomfortable.

DARNELL
(defensive)
You expecting me to start humping
your leg or something?

CAMPBELL
No, of course, not.

DARNELL
You got a problem with me now?

CAMPBELL
Darnell, no. It's cool. I just wasn't
expecting it.

Darnell sees that Campbell means it. It's a nice change.

DARNELL
Yeah, sorry. It usually takes people
a while to get used to it.
(beat) )
Hell, I'm still getting used to it.

CAMPBELL
How'd it happen?

DARNELL
About a year ago, my partner and I
responded to a domestic dispute. We
were attacked by a Shapeshifter and
contracted the disease. He didn't
survive the change. I did.

CAMPBELL
Is that how you ended up in the SCD?

DARNELL
It's funny, I was a lot like Rich
once. Couldn't stand non-Humans.
Thought they were all a bunch of
freaks. Then boom, I'ma freak.
Only I was still me, you know? Most
of my old buddies didn't see it that
way. Couldn't see past what I'd
become.

(MORE )

45.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 46.

DARNELL (CONT'D)
I was this close to quitting the
force. But Alex convinced me to
stay. Use my ‘unique perspective!
to help people.

CAMPBELL
She was right. You're still a good
cop.

DARNELL
I'm trying.

INT. 6TH PRECINCT, SCD OFFICES - DAY

As Alex and Darnell review their notes, Campbell enters
holding a file.

CAMPBELL
We got the blood work back from the
Preternatural Sciences Lab in D.C.
It's a bacterial protein toxin, with
a specific cytotoxix activity that
invades healthy Vampire hemoglobin.

DARNELL
Well, that sure clears everything
up.

CAMPBELL

The toxin was specifically
manufactured to attack a Vampire's
cell structure.

ALEX
Sounds like some pretty heavy duty
engineering.

CAMPBELL
A DNA marker traced the toxin back
to a study into Vampirism conducted
by BioGen Laboratories in Boston.

Darnell moves to a computer and does a Web search for BioGen.

DARNELL
Look at this. BioGen is a subsidiary
of Kemp Industries.

ALEX
Doubt that's a coincidence. Can you
pull up an employee list?

DARNELL
No problem.
(MORE )
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 47.

DARNELL (CONT'D)
(beat)
They're a government contractor so
photos are on file too.
Campbell and Alex move to stand behind Darnell.
ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

Names and faces scroll past. Unfamiliar, anonymous.

ALEX (V.0.)
Stop. Back it up one.

The screen backs up one ID. We see a familiar face and name.
BACK TO SCENE
ALEX (CONT'D)
Curt Smith. Currently manager of

the blood processing facility in
Queens.

CAMPBELL
I thought you said he was a Vampire?

ALEX
He is.

Darnell hits more keys and another screen comes up.

DARNELL
Smith's not in the National Non-Human
Registry.

CAMPBELL

If he didn't register, it means he's
got something to hide.

ALEX
Not that he's a Vampire. He was
pretty open about it.
(beat)
Darnell, go to the blood processing
facility and pick him up. Take some
back-up in case he resists.

CAMPBELL
Want me to go with him?

ALEX
No. You and I are going to have a
little chat with Kemp.
INT. KEMP INDUSTRIES BUILDING, KEMP'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Kemp paces the floor of his spacious office speaking into a
telephone headset.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 48.

Floor to ceiling windows behind his mammoth desk reveal
breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline.

The doors suddenly burst open and Alex, followed by Campbell,
strides in.

KEMP.
(into headset)
I'll have to call you back.

Alex walks up to Kemp, gets right in his face.

ALEX
You lied to me.

Kemp sits down behind his desk, cool and relaxed.

KEMP.
Why don't you calm down and tell me
what you're talking about.

ALEX
Not only are you using the recent
Vampire poisonings to further your
agenda, but you're behind the whole
thing.

KEMP.
That's insane!

CAMPBELL
You own BioGen Labs in Boston.

KEMP.
I own a lot of companies.

CAMPBELL
What do they do there?

KEMP.
Study the Vampire and Shapeshifter
Viruses. We're trying to find an

antidote.
CAMPBELL
Have you asked if they want one?
ALEX
Tell me about Curt Smith. He worked
at BioGen.
KEMP.

I employ literally thousands of
people, I can't be expected to know
them all by name.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 49.

ALEX
I'd think you'd remember this one.
He's a Vampire.

KEMP.
Don't be ridiculous. I'd never hire
a Vampire.

Campbell tosses a picture of Curt Smith across the desk.

ALEX
You hired this one.

Kemp is clearly shocked, even horrified.

KEMP.
Smith's a Vampire?
CAMPBELL
So, you do know him?
KEMP.
I've met him a few times. He works
with Dali.
ALEX

Why is Dali hanging around a Vampire?

KEMP.
I assure you Alex, I had no idea
Smith was a Vampire.
(beat)
That's the problem, it's too hard to
tell these days.

The penny drops for Alex. A big, heavy, very scary penny.
Alex abruptly turns and hurries out of the office.

CAMPBELL
Looks like we're done here. Thanks.

He goes after Alex.
INT. KEMP INDUSTRIES BUILDING, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Campbell catches up with Alex. They move quickly through
the hallway together.

CAMPBELL
What? What is it?

ALEX
Kemp's right. It is hard to tell
these days. This is all starting to
make sense.
(beat)
Dali is from Boston, so is Smith.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 50.

Campbell is right there with her

CAMPBELL
And those two goons we picked up.
If Dali brought his people down with
him, he's been planning this for a
while.

ALEX
Christien said something the other
night. There are Human matters and
Vampire matters. This has been about
the Vampires all along. Just not in
the way we thought.

CAMPBELL
Meaning?

ALEX
Dali. I think he's a Vampire.

INT. HUMANS FIRST HEADQUARTERS, DALI'S OFFICE - LATER

Curt Smith and Dali confer.

SMITH
I got a call from a friend at BioGen.
The cops have been sniffing around.

DALI
This pushes our timetable up a bit.
(beat)
Are we ready?

SMITH
Absolutely. Now, that we've laid
the groundwork, the rest of the
poisoned blood will be distributed
tonight. There'll be a thousand
dead Vampires by morning.

DALI
And thousands more looking for new
leadership. Strong leadership that
will return our people to their once
feared position of power

SMITH
Christien still has a lot of support.

DALI
After tonight, Christien won't be a
problem.

Dali opens his mouth and SLIDES OFF THE CAPS COVERING HIS
CANINE TEETH AND EXTENDS A SET OF HUGE FANGS.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 51.

DALI (CONT'D)
You have no idea how uncomfortable
these are.

An INTERCOM on Dali's desk buzzes.

DALI (CONT'D)
Yes.

VOICE ON INTERCOM
Mr. Dali, this is security. Two
police detectives are on their way
up to your office.

Dali quickly moves from behind his desk toward the room's
back door.

DALI
Curt, take care of them. I have an
appointment I don't want to be late
for.

As Dali exits, Curt smiles widely, revealing his sharp fangs.

SMITH
My pleasure.

A beat later, Alex and Campbell enter Dali's office, guns
drawn.

ALEX
Nothing stupid, Smith. Get down on
the ground. NOW!

In the blink of an eye, Smith GOES FULL VAMP (fangs extended,
eyes blood red) and LAUNCHES himself at Alex and Campbell.

Campbell OPENS FIRES. The bullets STRIKE Smith, but barely
slow him down.

ALEX (CONT'D)
(to Campbell)
He's too old, bullets won't stop
him.

Smith POUNCES on Campbell, quickly taking Campbell to the
ground. Campbell fights back, landing VICIOUS BLOWS to
Smith's neck and face. A blow connects with Smith's nose,
spraying Campbell with BLOOD.

Alex reaches inside her jacket and pulls out A SMALL SILVER
CYLINDER. With a TWIST OF HER WRIST, the cylinder EXTENDS
to become a HIGH-TECH STAKE.

Campbell struggles with all his strength to keep Smith's
fangs away from his neck. But he loses his grip and Smith's
fangs descend....
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 52.

Smith BITES Campbell just as Alex PLUNGES her stake into
Smith's back and PIERCES HIS HEART. Smith falls DEAD on top
of Campbell.

Alex yanks Smith's body off Campbell and drops it heavily to
the ground.

ALEX (CONT'D)
You all right?

CAMPBELL
(re: Alex's stake)
How do I requisition one of those?

Campbell holds his neck where he was bitten.

ALEX
Let me see.

CAMPBELL
I think he nicked me.

Alex moves Campbell's hand to find an UGLY GASH on Campbell's
neck where Smith's fangs had ripped the skin. We see
Campbell's bright red blood on Alex's hand as she pulls a
handkerchief out of her pocket and carefully presses it to
the wound.

ALEX
That's more than a nick. But he
missed the jugular.

CAMPBELL
I don't think he had a chance to
infect me with the virus.

ALEX
No, he was trying to kill you, not
turn you.

CAMPBELL
I'll get tested anyway. Just to be
sure.

Alex helps Campbell up. He's pale, but steady on his feet.

ALEX
You sure you're okay? Should we
call the EMTs?

CAMPBELL
I'm fine. All in a day's work.

Alex knows he's putting on a brave front for her, but she's
impressed anyway. She reaches out to wipe a splatter of
blood from Campbell's face.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 53.

ALEX
Not bad, Fletcher. A lot of people
would've really freaked out.

CAMPBELL
Don't go all soft on me now,
Detective. We still have work to
do.

Alex and Campbell move to Dali's desk and begin searching
it. Campbell spots Dali's discarded teeth caps.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
What are these?

Alex takes the small pieces of white porcelain from Campbell.

ALEX
Caps. Dali must've used them to
hide his fangs.

CAMPBELL
Why'd he leave them?

ALEX
He must think he doesn't need them
anymore. Doesn't need to hide.

Campbell moves to Smith's body. He begins to riffle through
Smith pockets. Campbell pulls out a FEW FOLDED SHEETS OF
PAPER.

CAMPBELL
Alex, look at this.

Campbell shows her the papers.

ALEX
Shipping orders from the Blood
Processing Facility. Poisoned blood
is being sent all over the city
tonight.

CAMPBELL
But why is Dali doing this? why
does he want Humans and Vampires
fighting each other? What does he
get out of it?

ALEX
It's a power play. By poisoning the
blood supply, Dali's convinced the
Vampires they're not safe anymore.
He's going to use their fear to turn
them against Christien.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 54.

CAMPBELL
Dali wants to become the new leader
of the Vampires?

ALEX
Which means the only person standing
in his way now is...

Alex pulls out her cell phone and dials.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Come on, Christien pick up. Pick
up!

Alex snaps her phone closed and hands Campbell the shipping
lists.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Take these lists to Kincaid. Tell
him to rally every cop in the city.
If we don't stop this tainted blood
from getting to the blood banks, New
York is going to become a war zone.

Off Alex...
END OF ACT THREE
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 55.
ACT FOUR
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - EVENING

At VARIOUS LOCATIONS around the City, a frantic and massive
police operation is under way.

CAMPBELL leads a TEAM OF UNIFORMED OFFICERS into a Blood
Bank, where a truck is in the middle of off-loading its supply
of tainted blood.

DARNELL, behind the wheel of an unmarked police car with
lights flashing, SKIDS to a STOP in front of a BLOOD TRANSFER
TRUCK. He leaps out of the car, badge in one hand, gun in
the other.

KINCAID leads a fleet of BLACK AND WHITES, LIGHTS FLASHING
AND SIRENS BLARING, as they intercept other BLOOD TRANSFER
TRUCKS .

Unsuspecting DRIVERS are pulled from their trucks at gun
point, as OFFICERS secure their deadly payloads.

INT. CLUB CARNAGE, LOUNGE - NIGHT

Alex enters to find the Club dark, empty, and all too quiet.
She draws her weapon.

ALEX
Christien?!

No answer. Alex cocks her gun.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Christien? Are you here?

Alex's senses are on fire, she's not frightened, just focused.

Something moves in the deep shadows across the room. Alex
sees it and trains her gun in that direction.

DALI (0.S.)
I'm afraid it's just me.

Dali emerges from the shadows.

ALEX
Stop right there.

Dali doesn't stop. He continues to walk toward Alex.

DALI
Or what? You'll shoot me? Do you
think your bullets can kill me?

ALEX
I think they'll hurt. A lot.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 56.

DALI
I'm not afraid of a little pain. In
fact, I might enjoy it.

Keeping her gun trained on Dali, she reaches into her pocket
with her other hand and finds her stake. She extends it.

ALEX
How'd you enjoy your time with Humans
First?

DALI

I laughed myself to sleep every night.

ALEX
How could you pass for Human for so
long? I saw you at the Rally. You
were standing in broad daylight.

DALI
I have lived many years, Alex. More
even than your friend Christien.
There are only a handful of us in
the world and we are very, very
powerful.

Dali is getting entirely too close. Alex doesn't want to
give up ground, but she doesn't want to have to fight this
fucker either.

ALEX
What do you want?

Dali circles Alex, studying her, careful to stay just out of
reach of her stake. Just in case.

DALI
I've decided to get into politics.
As many of your Human leaders have
proven, there's no better way to
consolidate power than to start a
war.

ALEX
I can't let you do that.

DALI
I am a Sanguis Vestus. You can't
stop me.

ALEX
I don't care if you're the Queen of
the Damned, this is my City.

Alex suddenly draws in a SHORT STARTLED BREATH as she feels
another PRESENCE in the room.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 57.

The Camera finds Christien, who has appeared as if out of
thin air.

CHRISTIEN
No, it's mine.

The air crackles with tension, there's an energy that's almost
palpable.

DALI
You had your chance to lead Christien.
But you sold your people out,
pandering to the Humans, subjugating
yourself to their laws.

ALEX
Those laws keep the peace.

CHRISTIEN
Stay out of this Alex.
(to Dali)
We have laws too, Dali. And you've
broken them. Killed your own kind
by poisoning their blood.

DALI
Cloned blood from banks? Vampires
have become nothing but pigs feeding
at the Humans' trough. I will return
the Vampire Community to prominence.
No more blood banks. No more living
in fear of Humans and their laws.

CHRISTIEN
You're talking about starting a war.

DALI
One that's been long overdue.

CHRISTIEN
One we may not win.

DALI
You just don't have the stomach for
it.
Christien just smiles. It's a smile that promises death.
Alex gives everyone one more chance to be reasonable...

ALEX
Christien, this is a police matter
Dali, I'm placing you under arrest...

She knows its stupid even as she says it, but hey, it's her
job. Dali never takes his eyes off Christen.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 58.

DALI
(to Alex)
Stick around, Detective. I'm going
to be hungry when I'm done.

And with a rush of air and sound it begins.

Alex dives out of the way as Christien rushes Dali. But
with staggering speed, Dali side-steps Christien and uses
his momentum to HURL Christien across the Club. Christien
SMASHES into a wall.

But, Christien quickly recovers and LEAPS, almost flies,
back to Dali, landing a SERIES OF BLOWS that staggers Dali,
but he doesn't fall.

Christien and Dali TRADE SAVAGE BLOWS that would kill a Human.

VICIOUS ROUND HOUSE KICKS snap necks and heads backward as
they crash against each other and to the floor, only to return
to their feet and continue their brutal ballet.

BLOOD FLOWS from their noses, mouth, eyes, yet the ferocity
of their attacks do not wane until Christien finally gains
the upper hand. He catches Dali's guard down for a split
second and DRIVES him across the room.

Christien and Dali crash into the bar, sliding across its
smooth surface, shattering bottles and other assorted glass
as they go. Dali is momentarily STUNNED.

IN SLOW MOTION

Christien raises himself over Dali. His eyes are FILLED
WITH BLOOD. He DRAWS his HAND back and over his head, ready
to plunge his fist into Dali's chest and rip his heart out...

BACK TO SPEED
Alex runs toward them.

ALEX
NO!

Christien's focus is broken. He looks at Alex as if she's
lost her mind.

CHRISTIEN
I have the right to kill any Vampire
that challenges me.

ALEX
This isn't only about Vampires.
Dali's crimes affected Humans too.
If you kill him now, the City has no
closure. Without Dali, we'll never
be able to explain what happened.
(MORE )
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 59.

ALEX (CONT'D)
If we don't bring him in, how can we
convince people its over?

Right now, Christien doesn't care. With incredible strength,
he grabs Dali around the neck and lifts him straight up in
the air. Dali SHRIEKS AND FLAILS WILDLY.

Alex GRABS Christien's arm.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Christien, this city. Your City
needs to see Dali punished under the
law, everyone's law.

Christien locks eyes with Alex for a long moment. Then,
Christien lets out a horrible SCREAM of un-exercised RAGE as
he HURLS Dali across the room.

Dali CRASHES into a wall and falls unconscious to the ground.

Christien turns to Alex, his eyes slowly draining of their
red...

CHRISTIEN
That's two you owe me.

UNIFORMED POLICE burst in the room to find Alex and a bloodied
Christien standing silently in the middle of the dark Club...

ON A TELEVISION - NIGHT

Kincaid stands at a PODIUM. In front of him, A CLUSTER OF
MICROPHONES and a SMALL SEA OF REPORTERS. Behind him, Jack
Kemp tries to hide his discomfort to be standing shoulder to
shoulder with his most hated adversary, Christien. Christien
loves that Kemp is miserable and, of course, he loves the
camera.

KINCAID
The Mayor's Office, in conjunction
with the NYPD, has officially
confirmed that all the contaminated
blood has been accounted for and
destroyed. The blood in our Blood
Bank System is now 100% safe.

Kincaid steps back from the microphones, as Christien steps
forward.

CHRISTIEN
On behalf of the entire Vampire
Community I would like to extend our
thanks to the NYPD, especially the
Supernatural Crimes Division, in
dealing so quickly with a very
dangerous situation. We are grateful
that the rule of law has prevailed.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 60.

As the cameras click and their flashes strobe, Christien
gives Kincaid a hearty handshake, before stepping back. He
gives Kemp a smirk as Kemp approaches the microphone.

KEMP.
As the public is well aware, Humans
First has always been and will
continue to be a law-abiding
organization. The unfortunate actions
of one man will in no way derail us
from our stated goals.

The gathered Reporters pounce...

REPORTER 1
Mr. Kemp, what does it mean that a
Vampire was able to infiltrate Humans
First so easily?

REPORTER 2
Mr, Kemp, is it true you personally
recruited Dali?

As Kemp hems and haws, we pull back to REVEAL we're in...
INT. BAR 390 - NIGHT

A local cop hang out. Lots of brass and wood. Pictures of
fallen officers adorn the wall behind the bar. Definitely
more of a beer and shots than cocktails crowd.

Alex and Chase sit at the bar. In front of them are two
glasses on wine and a copy of THE NEW YORK TIMES.

TIGHT ON

The Headline: HIGH RANKING MEMBER OF HUMAN'S FIRST REVEALED
TO BE A VAMPIRE. Byline: CHASE DESMOND.

BACK TO SCENE

The television continues to drone on in the background, but
Alex and Chase have seen all they want to see.

CHASE
Did you see the look on Kemp's face?
Classic.

ALEX

He's going to be living this down
for a long time.

Alex and Chase pick up their glasses and clink them ina
little toast.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 61.

CHASE
You took a big chance going to Club
Carnage like that.

ALEX
I had to get that scoop I promised
you, right?

CHASE

It's not funny. What if Dali had
killed Christien? You would've been
next.

Alex thinks for a moment.

ALEX
You know, it's weird. That didn't
even occur to me. I just assumed
Christien would win.

CHASE
He isn't invincible.

ALEX
Don't tell him that.

(beat)
I don't know what I would've done if
he'd killed Dali. I'm picturing
trying to get the cuffs on him...

CHASE
Harder in this situation than a couple
others I can think of.

ALEX
Ha, ha.

CHASE
You know Christien wants you. He
didn't spare Dali for the 'sake of
the city'. He did it for you.
Because it was important to you.

Alex stares into her glass where the red wine swirls. She
notices it's almost the color of blood.

ALEX
How am I supposed...?

She stops mid-sentence when she sees Campbell approaching.

ALEX (CONT'D)
Hey.

CAMPBELL
Hey.
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 62.

He sees Chase.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
I don't want to interrupt.

Chase stands as Alex lets Campbell in.

CHASE
Actually I was just leaving. Nice
to see you again, Detective.

CAMPBELL
Likewise.

Chase grabs her coat and gives Alex a hug goodbye.

CHASE
(whispering)
He's hot. For a Human.

The bar patrons part appreciatively for Chase as she sails
out the door.

Campbell sits down and puts his drink on the bar

CAMPBELL
Nice to have a night off.

ALEX
Don't get used to it, they're few
and far between.

(beat)
You did pretty good out there,
Fletcher.

CAMPBELL
Just pretty good? Come on, I've got
war wounds.

Campbell reflexively puts a hand to his bandaged neck

ALEX
How is it?

CAMPBELL
Got the blood tests back. Still one
hundred percent Human.

 

 

There's a "Thank God" in there somewhere.

ALEX
Not ready to see how the other half
lives?

CAMPBELL

I think I'll leave that to Darnell.
(MORE )
NIGHT WATCH - "Pilot" - 3-12-07 63.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
Although I suppose being a Vampire
could have its moments.

Campbell raises an eyebrow, but Alex isn't taking the bait.
There's been enough talk about Vampires tonight.

CAMPBELL (CONT'D)
So, am I in, or what? Kincaid said
you have the final say.

Alex picks up her glass and holds it up. Part of her is
sure this is a mistake, but there's something about him..

ALEX
Don't make me regret this.

Campbell leans in to her space. He is only inches away.
Alex can feel the warmth of his skin, feel his breath on her
face as he asks,

CAMPBELL
What's life without a few regrets?

ALEX
Welcome to the squad, Campbell.

With a grin, Campbell drains his glass with a single swallow
and Alex suspects her life suddenly just became even more
complicated...

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

The CAMERA PANS UP to a FULL MOON high above the city, Alex's
city.

CAMERA PANS OFF the FULL MOON and finds...

Christien, standing on a balcony, watching the same moon
high above the city, Christien's city.

THE END
