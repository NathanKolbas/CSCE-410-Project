FADE IN
EXT. IRISH SEA - DAY

A small boat in the ocean on a beautiful sunny day. There is an intensity about
the light, the image, that has the emotional power of memory.

A strong attractive man in his thirties is at the tiller. Next to him sits an eight year
old boy, his son.

In the background, like a mirage, we see the misty green coast of northern
Ireland.

SCREEN CARD: NORTHERN IRELAND, 1973.
CLOSE SHOT - FATHER AND SON - DAY

The boy looks up, his large blue eyes looking into his father's. The father smiles
down lovingly at his son. He takes his son's hand and puts it on the tiller.

The boy beams with delight.

CLOSE UP - THE BOY'S HAND ON THE TILLER AS THE FATHER’S HAND
HOVERS OVER IT PROTECTIVELY. .

INT. DINING ROOM OF A MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NORTHERN IRELAND -
DAY

The FATHER, in vest and tie, is seated at the head of the table. The MOTHER
and two GIRLS bring bowls of food from the kitchen. The eight-year-old BOY,
seated on the other end, next to a 4 year old sister, tucks his napkin into his
Shirt, imitating his father. :

From off screen a RADIO broadcasts the news.

RADIO (OC)
..Clashes between Catholics and Protestants in
Northern ireland. Three thousand Republican
supporters defied the government ban as they tried
to march the seven miles from Belfast down the M1
motor way to the prison camp of Long Kesh, in a
protest against internment...

Their sudden ATTENTION is to a knock on the door. The BOY runs through the
short hallway at the front door and opens it.

ALL FROM THE BOY'S POV:

A MAN'S hand raised in front of his face to a wool skullcap. The hand pulls
down on the “cap.” It's a ski mask that covers the man's face.

RADIO (CONT.) ‘

There was almost a serious mistake in the Falls Road

area when an army patrol was ambushed by children

who had been given realistic looking toy guns and

uniforms for Christmas.
He pushes past the boy and STRIDES FAST to the dining room doorway. The
boy hurries after and reaches the striding man’s side. Looks into the room
along the man’s arm, which is now holding a MACHINE PISTOL.
The father’s eyes go wide with surprise rather than terror...
The gun, directly in front of the boy, suddenly opens fire
BLASTING THE FATHER backward off his chair.
ANGLE ON THE BOY

He rushes over to his little sister and tries to stand protectively between her and
the horror.

WIDE SHOT

to reveal the big, cold-as-ice BRITISH INTERROGATOR.

A STARK ROOM in which our Young Man is strapped into a chair. On the table
in front of him is a single sheet of paper. A typewritten confession. .

With his left-hand the interrogator holds out a pen, while he looks up and
studies :

A LARGE WALL CLOCK WITH A SWEEP SECOND HAND.

That's what the pair of blue eyes had been watching a few moments earlier.
Both men watch it now as the second hand approaches the 30 second mark.
THROUGH EVERYTHING THEY NEVER MAKE EYE CONTACT

The interrogator slowly... almost tiredly... pivots his weight into position. The
Young Man hold his breath.

Precisely when the second hand touches 30,
WHAM!

The back to the clock, waiting for it to hit the zero mark, left hand extending the
pen.

Our sense is that this could go on forever.
WHAM!
A tiny trickle of biood works its way out of the Young Man's ear.

The interrogator EVER SO GENTLY uses his pinkie to lift some blood...
examines it ...impassively and VERY GENTLY wipes it on the Young Man's
shirtfront, then back to the clock... again the pen extended. Still no eye contact.

a single jazz trumpeter, young, white, long haired, hippy look standing on the rim
of the fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel, playing to a large gathering of tourists
and passers-by. :

Rory is transfixed.A temporary lull in the traffic allows the trumpeter's long notes
to bounce off the glass walls of the Grace building and reverberate around the
square.

As Rory watches, behind him on 58th,a street vendor pushing his steaming food
cart, along the street, cuts into the path of a dilapidated yellow cab. The cab
clips the food cart, shuddering it, spilling, some bread rolls onto the road. The

The cabbie, exploding with anger, turns on the crowd, and Rory.

CABBIE

Rory laughs in disbelief.
As two cops stroll over to the accident-an air of sublimely jaded caim.
COP

Hey, hey, hey.

People start to calm down, one cop sorts out traffic as the other gets between
the vendor and cabbie.

Rory wanders across the road, still mesmerized by the unique anarchy and joy
of New York. He continues on to 53rd and Ninth.

parts from her. . :

She pulls him back to her, as if holding him will keep him
from what awaits him, protect him from his fate.

He hesitates..and then takes her in his arms. he buries his
mouth on hers, pressing his body to hers. His goul.

‘ BURKE.
New York's favorite fugitive! You
sounded a little anxious on the phone. |
see you're broken but unbowed. And
missing a large package, from the looks
of it.

RORY
Here's your chance to deliver for dear old
Mother Ireland. Take our lOU, Billy.
We'll raise the money again in a matter of
months. :

Burke gestures to his associates:

BURKE
Grab an eyeful, boys. Those are Belfast
Balls. World renowned.

Burke is through with the compliments. He turns on Rory:

BURKE
| don't do business with cop killers,
especially when they're broke,

Rory puts his left hand into his pocket... not too fast,
Burke, Teddy and both Henchmen
~ DRAW GUNS IMMEDIATELY
Rory freezes.
BURKE
Put just two fingers in that pocket. and
take out what's in it. Slowwww.
Rory extracts a .32 caliber pistol, squats a bit, drops it.

But do you know what they'll fetch me in

As they approach, Rory calmly pulls a gun and
In lightning fast succession, he

He fixes them to one another at the comers with toggle fasteners. It now looks

Rory drives the truck right up to the edge of the pier.

The MONTAUK LADY waits - bow pointing towards the ocean, stern raised up
in the air, attached by two THICK ROPES to a large winch.

Rory hurries around to the back of the flatbed. Cranks open the straps that
hold the missile container onto the truck. Quickly, he pulls the straps around
the entire pallet and ties them off into a makeshift cradle hamess. Jumps
down. “oe

HOOKS ON to the Strap harness. He sets the winch in motion.

Rory finishes unloading the missiles into the cargo hold. Closes the hatch,

Now he looks up. Studies the rope lines that stretch from the stern to the dry
dock winch. .

He climbs up into the wheelhouse. Inserts the key and turns it to check the
power systems. A board of lights FLASH ON. The engine is engaged.

Rory switches the power off, Turns around, and grabs an axe hanging next to
the fire extinguisher. :

He walks the axe Over to the edge of the stem. Takes aim and staris
CHOPPING AT THE FOUR INCH THICK ROPE

He strokes evenly, ignoring the Pain that shoots up from his shouider.
The strands fray and break, fray and break until

THE HUGE LINE SNAPS IN TWO.

As the loose end fails into the water,

“THE BOAT LISTS SIDEWayYs

_ Rory steps Over to the other side of the stern, where the second rope now

hoids the entire weight of the one hundred and ten foot ship.
Preparing to swing the axe, he catches sight of
CAR HEADLIGHTS

speeding up to the dock.

Rary starts in on the rope. Chop. Chop.

The car disappears behind the side of the dry dock. Then reappears, speeding
with its HEADLIGHTS pointed toward the town.

Rory stops. Listens. Hears only the sound of the boat CREAKING. He
CHOPS again. Stops. Hears a different sound.

He puts the axe down silently. Looks back at the rope, now half-frayed. Draws
his pistol from his waistband.

Leaning in against the wall of the main cabin, he can make out the shadow of
the scaffolding that butts against the ship.

A figure DARTS by. Rory takes aim. Moves forward to the edge of the cabin
wall. Waits.

His eyes check the STRING OF LIGHTS that illuminate the sides of the dry
dock. Now he listens. : :

A VOICE breaks the silence.

O'MEARA (OC)
RORY.

Rory tries locating O'Meara's position by his voice.

O'MEARA (OC)

It's over now. it's all over.
The boat CREAKS slowly, from side to side.

O'MEARA (OC)
Where can you hide?

Rory starts to backtrack, CIRCLING clockwise around the main ‘cabin.

O’MEARA (OC)
Where can you go?

Rory reaches the first corner. Inches forward. Sees himself clear.

O’MEARA (OC)
Let's break the cycle. Right now. You
and me. No more killing. No revenge.
None of it.

Rory finishes the circle. Comes upon O'Meara, ten feet ahead, HIS BACK TO
RORY. .

He's facing the stern, Speaks into the darkness,

O'MEARA
'f we stop, if we put down our guns...

O'Meara stops, turns his head slowly around, instinctively conscious of
RORY, POINTING HIS GUN STRAIGHT AT HIM
He stares, fearless and vulnerable, Straight into Rory's eyes.

Rory blinks. Looks at his gun hand, as if it belonged totally to someone else.
Wonders why the finger doesn't pull the trigger. .

Suddenly there is a foud SNAP as the frayed winch Tope gives way.
Simultaneousty:

THE BOAT LURCHES FORWARD AT A SHARP ANGLE

THEY CRASH INTO A FORE WALL, guns skitfering.

Now the deck-HEAVES UP in the other direction as the boat

When the racking subsides, we see

"RORY, ON ALL FOURS.

The guns jay between them. O'Meara's pistol four feet in front, and pointing
the wrong way. Rory's a similar distance in front of him, but Pointing at
O'Meara. .

They glance at each other. Down at the guns. Then back, eye to eye,

There's another way.

Rory shakes his head no.

It's an Irish story.

RORY GRABS HIS GUN, BUT DOESN'T ROLL

HE FIRES OFF THE MARK AS O'MEARA FIRES.

BOOM BOOM BOOM! THREE BULLETS RIP INTO RORY'S TORSO.
He staggers back. Drops his gun.

O'Meara runs over, Props Rory up by his shoulders.

O’MEARA
God damn you! Damn you!

Rory is bleeding, everywhere. Quiet voiced:

RORY
Well then...

O’'MEARA

Jesus... Jesus...

Rory coughs. He's going. He is barely abie to whisper. 0’ ‘Meara bends down to
try to understand what he is saying.

O'MEARA

Rory begs him with his eyes.

Finally O'Meara takes Rory’s hand and crosses himself:

life? ,
Rory nods.
O’MEARA

Are you sorry for having offended God?
He nods again.

O'MEARA
Then in the name ofthe Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.....
Rory's hand falls away as he dies. O'Meara’s voice drops:

O’MEARA

O'Meara cradles him in his arms, a father holding his dead son..
