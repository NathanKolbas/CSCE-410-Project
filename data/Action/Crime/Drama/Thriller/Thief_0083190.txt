BLACK SCREEN.
TILT DOWN TO:
1 EXT. STREET - FRANK - TWILIGHT

The haze and rain of winter weather is incandescent.
It RAINS. A little jumpy, he looks out at some-
thing. We don't know what. His hair is wet.

3 CLOSER - FRANK

on the sidewalk watching from another angle.

4 OVER HIS SHOULDER - APARTMENT BUILDING
across the street down the block. People coming
home from work race for doorways. As Frank watches,
we don't know who he is. We don't know why he's
looking at this building.

cur TO:

5 INT. BLACK ELDORADO - FRANK'S POV - SAME BUILDING
but pebbled by rain. He watches from inside the
car, now. Closer. He gets out. THROUGH the
pebbled WINDSCREEN we SEE him turn up the collar of
his coat and enter.

7 INT. APARTMENT - VI - TWILIGHT 7

BUZZER. VI rushes from the bedroom pulling a bathrobe
together at the SOUND of an ENTRY. A baby CRIES.

VI
Who is it? Who's there?!

.».-and sees Frank who can't get in because the chain
is on the door. She opens it. The TV is BLASTING.

VI
(continuing; off guard)
I thought you're working tonite?

The living room has chrome Onkyo receivers and Betamax
TV's and clock radios, silver swirl mirrors and a vinyl
bar. Lots of cheap chrome appliances. Frank has entered
his own apartment.

8 TWO SHOT 8

APRIL cries 0.S. Vi didn't expect Frank. She's a
great-looking trashy broad with white hair, a blue
rinse. Something else is going on.

vI
Forget something you need for
work, dear?

FRANK
(beat)
I thought you're out getting your
hair done?
(beat)
Why's the baby crying?

April cries louder.

VI
(shrieks to April)
Shut up!
(hisses at Frank)
I know about you!

FRANK
(half to himself,
quietly)
...this is not the way it's
supposed to be.

 

vI
I know what you been doing!

FRANK
Oh yeah? What have I been doin'?

VI
I figure it out. You weren't
at the car lot last night. I
checked. You weren't out buying
cars and working so goddamn hard
at night. You're out screwing
some fancy lady! Some whore on
the side you're balling, aren't
you?

FRANK
(laughs)
You're crazy. You don't have a
clue what I do at night.

Then it falls off. Frank pushes past. Vi's scared.

INT. BEDROOM - FRANK 9

moves through, enters bedroom. April cries louder.
The TV BLASTS. She shrinks back. Frank rips into
the closet.

VI
(shrieks)
You cheating rat bastard. You son
of a bitch. You're out getting
laid. Every night!

CLOSER - ROY 10
in polyester trousers and shirt, is between the clothes

and wall. Vi drops to the floor. Her robe falls open
in the f.g.

ROY
Ohmigod. Ohmigod.
vI
I am... I am paying you back!

I'm paying you back. That's all!

Vi shrieks as Frank whips Roy across the room by his
neck. He crashes upside down into the wall.

He falls off the bureau.

HANDHELD - TWO SHOT 11

Frank picks Roy off the ground and bounces him off more
walls, knocking over chrome kitchen chairs and appli-
ances. He throws him through the house on the install-
ment plan as Vi shrieks, as:

FRANK

(back to Vi)
I been true to you since the day
we met! I never, ever, since we've
been married, been out with
another broad! 'Cause that's how
it was supposed to be! I been
busting my ass! I been doin' a
bottle of Bennies a week to keep
goin' working day and night! I
am popping $1400 a month for the
funny farm you got this joint
turned into so you can get your
hair painted blue in the beauty
shop every day with your mother,
who so goddamned dumb she can't
boil water, taking care of April
instead of you. And you got the
balls to think I'm out snaking
around with the broads!!

INT. HALLWAY - HANDHELD - FRANK 12
throws Roy -- screaming -- down the stairs and
ignores him.
INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - FRANK 13
returns, hearing April cry from her bedroom crib.
FRANK
You rotten fucking bitch! With
April here yet!
VI

April! Why always fucking April!

Vi is suddenly fear-struck at what she said.

She knows Frank will kill her.

FRANK 14

steers her gently -- as if she were wet -- through the
kitchen, to the door.

FRANK

I take April. She stays with me!
You are completely unfit! You
don't give a damn! You are out!
You, your mother, your boyfriend
stick your face in front of me,
or try to hurt or grab the kid --
they find you belly up inna lake.

INT. HALLWAY - FRANK 15
whips her out of the apartment and throws her at Roy.

FRANK
And you, you stone jagoff!
Congratulations! You just got
yourself a broad!

Frank slams the door.

INT. APRIL'S BEDROOM - FRANK 16

takes April from the crib into the adjacent bath and
rinses her off in the bath with the shower hose calming
her down...

FRANK
Yeah. There ya go. I gotta get
you a pet turtle and stuff. How
would you like that? Huh? And
our own house. With a swing. And
a dog. And trees ‘cause they
rustle at night a lot. Huh?

He holds his daughter wrapped in a towel in the white
tiled bathroom.

out the window up at his apartment.

FRANK
Coffee.
COUNTERMAN
Coffee...? Whaddya got? A
hollow leg.
FRANK
(throws a dollar
at the Man)

Just the coffee, junior.

Counterman shuts up and pours. The ashtray and
demolished newspaper says Frank's been there awhile.

He blows on his hand. An O.S. WHINE becomes...

Frank cuts the engine, leaves the black jacket in the

Buick Regal are inside.) Barry kills the lights.
They're out the door.

Frank sits at the end, swings his legs on the edge like
a kid. The sun bends the horizon line and then breaks
through. Liquid. It's still. He drinks his coffee.

FRANK
Wanta Danish?

FISHERMAN
Yeah. Thanks.

FRANK

Look at that, huh?

FISHERMAN
That's magic. That's the Sky
Chief, man. That's what that is.
(long pause)
Ain't that Sky Chief sumthin'?
Huh.

Frank's face is washed with gold light. The sky behind
is electric blue and faraway. This is Frank's moment
of satisfaction, of mastery, of having put everything
back in order.

mixed hip-working-class and young attorney crowd at
the door.

‘Dear Frank, nothing new ever
happens around here. No, I don't
need any money or anything. Go
slow and EZ and keep knocking them
dead. I could never find the
words to tell you how proud I am
‘cause you are making your life
happen like you said and collecting
your debt back from society. And
I know you're pretty busy, but
could you come up ‘cause I gotta
see ya. Your pal, Okla.'

Frank unfolds his wallet to place the letter inside.

A tattered paste-up collage is there, too. He opens it.
There's a white house from a magazine. A cut-out
Cadillac is glued in front.

Bits and pieces of trees are drawn in with green Pentel.
A small baby from a Gerber food ad is near a woman --
mother. Okla's black and white face is there. It's
weird. We don't know what it means yet. Frank carries
it with him wherever he goes. Frank refolds it with
the letter and pockets them.

BARRY
Gags was putting juice loans on

Attaglia. Gags was pocketing the
principal and putting it back onna
street for himself -- they went
crazy... ba-boom!

Barry pulls in and parks in front of L&A Plating on
Ogden Avenue. A brown grim building among warehouses
and small shelters under a forest of water towers on
roofs:

FRANK
Gags down our merch?

BARRY
At the R.D. Lounge Pauli saw it go down.
It was your money that was in Gags' pocket
when he went out the window.

Frank pulls a .45 Colt Commander from the passenger

both Attaglia and the door.

ATTAGLIA
I'm Mr. Attaglia. You didn't get

FRANK
My name's Frank.

That was bullshit.

ATTAGLIA
What is this?

FRANK
This is Joe Gags. $183,300 of
my money. We have this problem...

ATTAGLIA
What are you talking about?

FRANK

He moved my merchandise. So the
money in his pocket before he
went out the window is my money...
I want my money.

ATTAGLIA
I don't know what you're talking

Whatever. The guy died?

FRANK
On the floor! Spread your legs!

Mitch is even heavier. Leo is a kidder. He has good

he said. I'm telling you this

for half this city. You're
putting down two, three scores
a month. Month in, month out.

LEO
I'll lay it out. You be the
judge.
FRANK
Go ahead.
LEO

You don't look, you don't case,
you don't do nothing no more. We
point you to a score, we tell you
what's in there. When we tell
you it's there, it's there. They
are laid-out scores.

FRANK
How they worked up?

LEO
Alarm system diagrams. Blueprints.
Sometimes the front door key.
Sometimes the scores are in on
it, everybody's ripping off the
insurance company.

FRANK
Work cars, drops, tools?

Bartender brings him a coke.

White light. NOISE. Frank blew everything up. Slow

of the white heat. Slowly... it's recognizable as Frank.
The ROAR is deafening. He moves the white center of

heat of the vault.

THE VAULT 254
is a vague outline of silver in the whiteness. The

heat hits it. Cement and molten steel EXPLODE away

like liquid violet pebbles.

FRANK 255

yellow in the burn-out. The silver turns iridescent

blue. Frank pushes the bar through the vault. The
colors shift to hotter silver.

Jessie's eyes open. She looks at her husband. Her hand
goes to Frank's thigh. Frank pulls Jessie up next to
him and she lies on top of him.

ANGLE 276

Jessie, still half asleep, holds Frank's face in both
hands and kisses his mouth. Frank pulls Jessie between
his legs and rubs her back under her sweater and his
hand goes over her buttocks which are moving warmly and
slowly pressing into him. Frank slips off her jeans
and she wriggles out of them and she undoes Frank's
fly. She spreads her legs around Frank's hips and
Frank pulls her onto him and they make love in front of
the fireplace on the floor in their house. Frank turns
her over and gets on top of her. His hands touch both
sides of her face and they look in each other's eyes.

FRANK 341

Moves through the arch, the .45 comes up.

WIDE 342

Leo FIRES a wild SHOT. Frank FIRES TWICE blowing

Leo against the lamp which doesn't break. Leo raises
the Magnum again. Frank's third SHOT kills him.
Leo's position is bent and grotesque; the fallen lamp
is lurid.

EXT. LEO'S HOUSE - ATTAGLIA - NIGHT 343

meanwhile struggles with side screen door and finally
smashes it off the top hinge, falls out and stumbles
across the side lawn.

EXT. LEO'S HOUSE - STREET - CARL & GUARD - NIGHT 344

the Guard is hauling a carbine. Carl is bring up his
shotgun as...

ATTAGLIA - NIGHT 345

across the street, running away, almost to the curb,
spins and FIRES wildly TWICE. Misses. While...

FRANK 346

FIRES from a Weaver combat stance hitting Carl who's
knocked back. Frank speed reloads, FIRES ONE SHOT,
downing the Guard, Carl is bringing up the shotgun.
Frank HAMMERS ON TWO SHOTS into Attaglia as he's panning
back Carl's shotgun FIRES. Frank is knocked back, his
shirt shredded, he aims coolly, FIRES TWICE. Carl's
dead.

FRANK 347

walks away from the sidewalk. The shredded shirt reveals
the black vest. The heavy .45 with the hammer still back,
hangs at the end of his arm. His face bleeds where two
of the shots hit him.

TRACKING - FRANK 348
down the sidewalk towards the Eldo down the street.
Neighbors in housecoats and robes runs past to see

what happened. Most ignore him. One or two see the
blood and the gun and back off.

cur TO:

EXT. PALISADES STREET - WIDE - DAY 349
It's summer. It's sun-baked. The sidewalks are pink

and hot. Smoked glass and steel buildings. Ocean.
REVERSE - YELLOW RENTAL CAR 350

approaches, searches, stops. Jessie's driving.

JESSIE 351

gets out. She looks different. Time's passed. She
checks an address. Goes in.

cur TO:

INT. APARTMENT - WIDE - DAY 352
White walls. Light carpets. Minimal. Cell-like. A

man in a T-shirt drinks coffee in REAR SHOT over glass
and steel table. Beyond him is a wall of light and sky:
floor to ceiling window. A DOORBELL RINGS.

HIS HAND 353
puts down the coffee mug. FOLLOW his hand to the door.

A black .45 is holstered in the small of his back.

DOOR 354

opens. Jessie stands there. Hallway recedes behind
her.

355 REVERSE - THE MAN 355

is Frank. He is truly astonished. New scars have
healed on his face from the shotgun wound. Jessie
walks past him to stand against the light. He closes
the door. He crosses to her. He doesn't touch her.
We don't know if she's bitter.

FRANK
(soft)
What are you doing here?
JESSIE
Finding you.
FRANK

How'd you get here?

JESSIE
By looking for five months.

Frank looks away.

FRANK
Why?
Jessie looks at him.
FRANK
(continuing)

I have never expected you would
find me. I did not expect you
would look.

JESSIE
(beat)
Your children are at the motel,
Frank.
He touches her...

FREEZE. RUN END CREDITS.
