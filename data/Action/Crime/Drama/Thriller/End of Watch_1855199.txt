Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal (Source Code, Love and Other Drugs, Prince of Persia:
The Sands of Time, Brothers, Rendition, Zodiac, Jarhead, Proof,

and the Furious, U-571)

Cinematographer: Roman Vasyanov (The Motel Life, Hipsters, Tiski)

This gritty, suspenseful drama follows Los Angeles Police Officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and
Zavala (Michael Pefia) as they face off against crack addicts, human traffickers and Mexican drug
cartels in the daily battle for control of the city’s meanest streets. Giving the story a gripping, first-
person immediacy, the action unfolds entirely through footage from the ubiquitous handheld HD
video cameras now commonly used by those on both sides of the law. After each grueling shift, the
partners and best friends return home to their families as husbands and fathers, leaving the
brutality of their jobs behind and making light of the courage it takes to go out into the streets every
day. Despite moments of self-doubt, they prove so effective as a law enforcement team that they
quickly become the targets of Sinaloan drug lords. When word gets out that the top bosses want
Taylor and Zavala “taken care of,’ the partners swear they’ve got each other covered, not realizing
their friendship is about to be tested to its limits. A powerful story of family, friendship, love, honor
and courage, END OF WATCH uses cutting edge technology to create a riveting portrait of the city’s
darkest, most violent corners, the cops who risk their lives there every day, and the price they and
their families are forced to pay.

“END OF WATCH” DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT
IMPORTANT PLEASE READ

 

To the reader from the writer and director:

1 would like to help you understand my vision for “End of Watch.” In the simplest terms, this is a
film about two best friends who happen to be policemen. We follow their lives over a period of
several months as they fall in love, have children, get married and otherwise live their lives. The
film also has a strong crime story and plenty of action of great scope. It is a film that will have
something for everyone and touch upon universal themes of friendship, love, honor and courage.
These are real people leading real lives.

Today’s young people create and consume video media in very different ways. They film their daily
lives and share these videos through social media. It is this novel use of video and the intimacy of
reality that I wish to emulate. This film will be shot in many of the same ways that young people
create media today. My concept is simple: The characters themselves are placing and operating the
cameras. This creates a very visceral reality, much like watching real dramatic action on the
Internet. One could term this method “French New Wave Cinema meets You Tube.”

Often “found footage” films are difficult to watch due to excessive camera movement. Please keep
in mind that these will not be shaky, unsteady “Cloverfield” type images. “End of Watch” will be shot
in anormal theatrical resolution using many standard production techniques. Image quality will be
high, the colors will be vibrant and beautiful. The shots will be incredibly lyrical and smooth.
Although the actors will be wearing cameras, the images produced will be much like typical
Steadicam shots, with the same grace and beauty, although from angles before unachievable.

1 am working with camera manufacturers to develop new cameras that will capture the images of
theatrical level quality yet be very small and compact. The extremely small, yet full resolution
cameras will be able to record the drama and action in ways that have not been possible before. In
success these new cameras will be nothing short of revolutionary. I believe the techniques used
will be groundbreaking unto themselves and will become an important talking point in the release
of the film. Of course there will also be standard camera coverage; my intent is to use all tools
available to tell this wonderful story. This film will be beautiful, clearly shot and will immerse the
viewer in it’s world in an intimate way.

“End of Watch” will deliver an exciting and fresh viewing experience for audiences of all
backgrounds. There will be nuanced and powerful performances by some of the best actors
working today. The audience will see police as they have never seen them, the journey will be
vibrant, fun and exciting. It will have the entertainment value of a “popcorn movie” yet deliver the
depth and sophistication of a powerful drama. I hope you enjoy the script and come on this
filmmaking journey with me.

Kind regards,
David Ayer
Los Angeles, California

EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL L.A. — DAY 1
POV OF A POLICE DASH CAM...

Racing through neighborhood streets chasing an ORANGE
CADILLAC...

The card didn't lie because this car chase is INSANE...
The SIRENS are blaring. The ENGINE roars. We hear the
CHATTER of the police radio. Incredible speeds. NEAR
MISSES with other vehicles...

Although we can't see them yet, the driver is MIKE ZAVALA
(24) and his partner DAN TAYLOR (23) rides shotgun.

TAYLOR (0.S.)
Clear right!

Dan's voice is pumping with adrenaline...

TAYLOR (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Watch it! Car!

ZAVALA (0.S.)
I see him.

The cop car swerves around a catering truck.

ZAVALA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Rightside? Rightside?!

TAYLOR (0.S.)
Right's clear! Go, go, go!

The orange Cadillac almost hits a pick-up loaded with
furniture.

ZAVALA (0.S.)
Whoa. Dude almost TC'ed.

Taylor "calls the pursuit" into the radio. This will go
on the duration of the pursuit.

TAYLOR (0.S.)
Thirteen-Adam-Nine Eastbound
Thirty Sixth Street passing
Waverly.

The Cadillac makes a hard right, disappearing from view,
the cop car turns and we see the Cadillac again.

TAYLOR (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Thirteen-Adam-Nine. Southbound
Raymond Avenue. From Denker.

ZAVALA (0.S.)
Where's he going?

TAYLOR (0.S.)
Disneyland.

The Cadillac makes a hard left, the cop car follows,
fishtailing a little.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Watch it.

Then:

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
He's running the light.

ZAVALA
Am I clear?!

TAYLOR
Clear. We're clear. Go for it.

The ENGINE HOWLS and the cop car catches up...

ZAVALA
Homie can drive.

TAYLOR
You're better. Watch the road.

A slow car blocks their way. Taylor's voice BOOMS OVER
THE PA LOUDSPEAKER...

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Pull over. Pull over.

The car doesn't.

ZAVALA
Pendejo.

The cop car swings into oncoming traffic -- A near miss!
They pass the unyielding driver...

TAYLOR
I don't see him. There he is!

The Cadillac is more distant. Zavala quickly closes the
gap...

EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL L.A. —- VARIOUS STREETS - CONTINUOUS 2

 

And so the chase goes. Turn after turn the Cadillac
fighting like a sportfish at the end of a line, unable to
shake the cop car...

Zavala and Taylor shouting over the siren. Tires
SCREECHING...

Then...

All the sound fades out. We're just watching the chase
unfold on the dashcam. Hypnotically beautiful...

TAYLOR'S VOICEOVER
I am the police. And I am here to
arrest you. You have broken the
law. I did not write the law. I
may even disagree with the law.
But I will enforcement it. I will
act professionally and treat you
with respect. I also expect to be
treated with respect. I will not
insult you. I will not brutalize
you. I will only use the force
necessary to stop you. I will do
whatever it takes to place you in
custody.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

TAYLOR'S VOICEOVER (CONT'D)
I am prepared to deprive you of
your freedom and if necessary your
life. I will not hesitate to kill
you if you endanger my life or the
lives of others. If you run away
I will chase you. If you fight me
I will fight back. If you shoot
at me I will shoot back. You are
in this situation because
something has gone wrong with your
life. Most likely this moment has
been a long time coming. As it is
unlikely this moment may be an
anomaly in an otherwise decent and
law abiding life. I understand
that factors in your life have
created an easy justification for
your actions. Poverty, lack of
education, drug abuse, emotional
and physical abuse may have
conspired to rob you of the
ability to obey the law. But many
other people have endured and
transcended much worse
circumstances than the ones which
have shaped your life. Yet you
have made bad decisions. You are
responsible for your behavior.
Your actions have made you my
responsibility. No matter how you
plead, cajole, beg or attempt to
stir my sympathies nothing you do
will stop me from placing you ina
steel cage with grey bars. By law
I am unable to walk away. I ama
consequence. I am the unpaid
bill. I am fate with a badge and
a gun. Behind my badge is a heart
like yours. I bleed, I think, I
love. And yes, I can be killed.
And although I am but one man, I
have thousands of brothers and
sisters who are the same as me.

The cop car is now very close to the Cadillac...

TAYLOR'S VOICEOVER (CONT’D)
They will lay down their lives for
me and I them. If you succeed in
stopping me, you will not succeed
in stopping them.

TAYLOR'S VOICEOVER (CONT’D)
We stand watch together, a thin
blue line, protecting the prey
from the predators. The good from
the bad. We are the police.

SCREEEEECH! -- The sound slams back in full force. The
lyrical, eerie quality of the chase now feels dangerous
and visceral. SIRENS, SQUEALING TIRES, ROARING
ENGINES...

EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL L.A. — INTERSECTION — CONTINUOUS 3

The cop car pulls alongside the Cadillac's bumper and
does a "Pit Maneuver." The Cadillac spins out...

TAYLOR
Good job, Z.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Thirteen-Adam-Nine. Code six.
Pursuit terminated. Suspect

Requesting supervisor and an RA.

We HEAR the POLICE CHOPPER overhead. The WAIL of a dozen
approaching sirens...

The gravity of the shooting now hits Taylor hard...

Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit.

ZAVALA
You okay, partner?

TAYLOR

ZAVALA
Walk it off.

MR. TRE
Y'all coming up in here. In my

Stealing my mail. Opening my

TAYLOR
Sir, I appreciate you have an
ongoing dispute with the your mail
carrier. However. That does not
justify you putting hands on him.

MR. TRE

Fool's a lying ass snitch. I'ma
take my mail. I get checks. I
get business correspondence.
Money in the mail. He be opening
that shit. I'ma take my mail

TAYLOR
Interfering with a mail carrier is
a federal crime. It's a felony.
This can go one of several ways.
Right now it's about your
attitude.

MR. TRE
I got my mail. I helped him. I
helped him give my mail to me.
This shit's over. Y'all can get
the fuck out my house.

ZAVALA
Sir, if you've been drinking you
need to stay inside and not
intimidate the mailman.

The sickening sound of punches landing on flesh as Zavala
works the inside with flurries of rabbit punches...

WHAM! -- Mr. Tre kicks him again. Then follows up with
his locomotive sized fists. Pounding Zavala into the
carpet. Zavala is clearly overwhelmed...

Taylor moving forward...

ZAVALA
Taylor! No! I got this.

Zavala takes the punches, drops to a knee, covers up.
Mr. Tre grabs his head and begins kneeing his face...

TAYLOR
Zz!

ZAVALA
Stay out.

Overpowered and outgunned, Zavala stubbornly holds on.
Taking blow after blow. It goes on and on...

Then Mr. Tre slows. He's panting from the exertion.
Chest heaving, arms burning from the effort...

And that is when Zavala suddenly rises up from certain

doom -- He explodes with a massive barrage of brutal hard
punches...
BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! -- He works Mr. Tre up and down his

body, waits for his big muscled arms to drop and when
they do...

SMACK-SMACK-SMACK-SMACK-SMACK-SMACK -- Zavala lights up
his face, finally landing a money shot on his jaw...

MR. TRE
Don't trip. I'ma say I locked it

Yo, just 'cause I look like the

Shut up. And her brother's always

TAYLOR
Not personally. Because you'll
hire a Home Depot dude for the

task.

ZAVALA
Her brother's lame.

TAYLOR
Quiet today.

ZAVALA

Don't say that. Last time you
said that we whacked two

gangbangers.
TAYLOR
You heard sarge. We'll be cool.

INT. CRACK HOUSE — DAY 11

[NOTE: THIS SCENE IS COVERED BY THE TWO SMALL CAMERAS
WORN ON TAYLOR'S AND ZAVALA'S UNIFORMS. ]

The house is a hoarder's dream -- Bottles, garbage.
Stacks of DVD players and car stereos.

A distraught FEMALE CRACKHEAD digs at her arm with her
nails. Eyes bugging, nose running.

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
My babies are gone. I can't find
my babies. Someone took my
babies. I been here all night. I
been with them. Someone took ‘em.
Maybe when I was in the bathroom.
Like quick. In and out.

TAYLOR
Ma'am, how many children are
missing and what are their ages?

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
They gone. I telling you they
gone. They ain't here.

TAYLOR
How many children are missing?

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
Two. Boy anda girl. My little
babies.

Zavala looking around. Thinking this is no place for a
child. He realizes her MAN FRIEND is sleeping on the
couch under several ratty blankets.

ZAVALA
Sir. Sir. Lemme see your hands.
Please sit up.

The man stirs. Zavala yanks off the blanket, he's in
boxers and socks. Zavala checks the cushions for
weapons.

ZAVALA (CONT'D)

Just sit up, sir. Put your hands
on your knees.

TAYLOR
Two children. A boy and a girl.
How old are they? Ma'am. Ma'am?
How old are the children?

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
One year old. The other be four.

MAN FRIEND
The kids okay. They with they
grandma. They okay. We're good
here, officer.

TAYLOR
We're going to check the house.
Sometimes children hide. They
could be hiding under a bed or in
the closet.

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
I been lookin'. Been looking.
Looked everywhere. You go look.
Wasting time. Get out there bring
me my babies back.

MAN FRIEND
You forgot they with they grandma.
You forgot. They okay.

Something is odd going on. Zavala covers the Crackhead
and her MAN FRIEND as Taylor checks the closets...

TAYLOR'S CAMERA POV -- Moving down the hall. He opens a
linen closet...

Inside is a BABY DUCT-TAPED to its car seat. Anda
LITTLE BOY also wrapped in duct-tape -- Feet and wrists
bound. Layers of tape over his mouth. Both children
STARING at Taylor with moist, pleading eyes...

We can hear him struggling to keep his composure...

TAYLOR
(into radio)
Thirteen-Adam-Thirteen. Request
supervisor and an RA to my
location. Two juvenile males
conscious breathing.

Taylor carefully peels the duct-tape back from the boy's
mouth.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
I'll be right back.

Taylor reenters the living room -- Bumps his crossed
forearms together -- That means to handcuff the people...

Zavala is on the woman in two steps -- Pulls his cuffs,
spins her and has her cuffed with practiced speed...

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
Why you doing me like this? Huh?

ZAVALA
Remain calm.

Taylor throws the Man Friend on the floor. Handcuffs
him. Struggling to act professional.

TAYLOR
You're under arrest.

MAN FRIEND
I'm sleeping. I'm sleeping is
all. The kids with they grandma.

ZAVALA
What's up, partner?

TAYLOR
I found the kids.

ZAVALA
And?

Taylor nods for him to look. Zavala crosses.

TAYLOR
Let the paramedics take the rest
of the tape off.

FEMALE CRACKHEAD
Lemme see my babies. Lemme see
them.

TAYLOR

Why are your children duct-taped
in a hall closet?

babies. I'ma press charges.
Taping my babies.

ZAVALA
Shut the fuck up!

MAN FRIEND
Bitch. You a snake, foul and low.
A lying snake. They was crying.
They wouldn't shut up. She told
me to do it. Why you call the
police you stupid-ass bitch? I
could'a told you they in the
closet. Dumb smoker bitch.

ZAVALA
Shut up asshole!

Zavala_and Taylor want to kill these people. But they
can't and they know it. Sometimes they have to protect
each other from themselves...

ZAVALA (CONT'D)
You good, partner. Got it under
control?

The SIRENS of approaching ambulance build...
TAYLOR
It's under control. You, Z? Got
it under control?

ZAVALA
Under control. Yeah.

This is one of those calls that forever strips away a
piece of a cop's soul. And they know it...

EXT. MR. TRE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 12

[NOTE: THIS IS SHOT HANDHELD BY THE GANGSTERS

HOLDING THE CAMERA IS DION BUT WE WON'T SEE HIM.

DJ

beat by a cop?

MR. TRE
I fought the dude. Homie took his
badge off and we squabbed straight

DJ
But you got arrested?

MR. TRE
Not for thumpin' on one time. For

BLASTER
You fought a cop and they didn't

MR. TRE
Nope. Nothing like that.

PEANUT

Nobody beat my ass. I whupped the

FAT RAT
Fuck those fools. And they moms.
Glad they got whacked.

BLASTER
They still niggas. LAPD still

MR. TRE
Motherfucker got the right niggas

PEANUT
Who that? Who car that?

The gangsters watch a minivan approaching. They
instinctively spread out. Sensing danger...

The minivan accelerates -- Then SCREECHES to a stop. The
door slides open...

The gangsters scatter...

POP-POP-POP-POP-POP! -- Flashes of light from the weapons
being fired inside the minivan...

We glimpse BLASTER returning fire with a Glock...

POP-POP-POP-POP! -- As the Minivan disappears around the

TAYLOR
There's a pattern. An M.O. here.
First date and a respectful kiss.
Second date, a nice dinner, then
full carnal knowledge. Third
date's dinner and uncomfortable
silences when I try and discuss
anything of merit. Then it's two
or three bootycalls and it's on to
the next.

ZAVALA
I went to my prom and got married
a week later. I ain't tapped
nobody but Old Faithful for like
eight years. Don't know what
you're tripping about, dude.

TAYLOR
I want someone to talk to. Not

ZAVALA
White people always get hung up on

basically decent charismatic 13 y.o.

TAYLOR
Casper. All of you. Go inside.
It's after curfew.

CASPER
C'mon Officer Taylor. It's my

TAYLOR
Fine. Keep standing around.
Because a P.B. Blood is dead on
the ground from a drive-by
shooting. What do you think is
going to happen next?

The kids trade looks. And quickly melt away to their
houses.

JUMP CUT -- MINUTES LATER...

Word has gotten out. The street is now empty. Doors are
closed. The previously vibrant neighborhood is on lock-

Zavala and Taylor are parked, lights off. Watching the
streets...

ZAVALA

Zavala points out a suspicious car a couple blocks

throw up. You'll see a fight.
It's all good.

JANET
I'm Irish. It's the same thing.
Everyone stays married forever.
Everyone has a big family, lots of

We're looking at the white minivan the homies from
Curbside used in the drive-by. It has been burned and is
still smoking. Zavala is intently checking the ground
for clues. Taylor narrates:

TAYLOR
This is what we believe may be the
code thirty seven vehicle used in
the drive-by last week. It fits
the description and comes back as
stolen. And you can see the
steering column has been ripped
open. Gangmembers like these
vehicles because they blend in and
you can put a lot of people in
them. This door slides back and
the gangmembers open up. The
victim was a male black gangmember
from a Blood set that has
basically been at war with this
Hispanic gang over control of
narcotics sales.

TAYLOR
There's forty five and nine
millimeter shellcasings inside.

HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 2
Oh yeah? How do you know that?
You grab 'em and measure them with
calipers? You touch them? You
contaminate the vehicle?

TAYLOR
Nossir.

ZAVALA
We found it. We called you.

criminalists do their CSI thing.

Zavala squeezes into the shot grinning...

his Rookie:

VAN HAUSER
Get out. Watch the street. Make
sure no assholes walk up and kill
us.

Now he points AT CAMERA:

VAN HAUSER (CONT’D)
Turn that goddamn camera off.

TAYLOR
It's off.

VAN HAUSER
It's off?

TAYLOR
It's off.

Taylor is a pretty good liar. Van Hauser leans against
his unit, crosses his arms.

VAN HAUSER
I see you guys trying to be good
little company men, doing the
Lord's work. You have your nose
up the command's ass. You're out
here doing whatever it is you
think you're doing. Making a
difference as you call it. It's
all fun and games. You get to run
jump fight and shoot. Well one
day, and mark my words. One day
the LAPD is going to bend you over
your black and white and fuck you
up the ass. They will fuck you so
long and so hard you'll want to
eat your gun just to make it stop.
And if you don't do it and the
fucking somehow stops, they'll
punish you for not eating your
gun. They'll give you freeway
therapy by assigning you to
Devonshire daywatch. So you spend
two hours on the freeway everyday
thinking about the fucking they
gave you. I was just like you
Taylor. Exactly like you. Making
a difference. At least the bad
guys attack from the front. The
department sneaks up from the
rear. Watch your six.

CAMERA catches the mortified expression of the young
Rookie who overheard all that. Zavala grins and pulls a
clear bottle from his pocket...
ZAVALA
I'm ready. It may say Purell.
But it's really K.Y.

Taylor cracks up laughing...

EXT./INT. CURBSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD/COP CAR - DAY 21

Zavala and Taylor sit in the shade of a tree watching the

You think they don't know you're

complaint on you, Taylor.

TAYLOR
The USS Van Hauser? LAPD's
stealthiest submarine, only
surfaces at the end of watch?

SARGE
He went through the academy before
you were born so show a little
respect. He said you were
videotaping him. I warned you
about that shit.

TAYLOR
I was documenting a crime scene.

SARGE
Just consider the wisdom of what
you're doing. The video camera
has not been good to this
department.

TAYLOR
I understand, sarge.

ZAVALA
Yo. Why's Van Hauser such a
bitter dude? If he hates pushing
a black and white so much why
don't he leave his badge on the
Watch Commander's desk and go
home?

SARGE
I didn't tell you this. He was
programmed to pull the pin a
couple years ago. He's got three
divorces under his belt so his
Margins were pretty slim. Turns
out marriage three-point-oh
cratered because he was tapping a
little mommy from right around
here and knocked her up. He's
gotta keep working to pay for the
kid. He'll end up doing thirty
and giving away his pension to a
lot of outstretched hands.

Taylor, I'm entering in my log I
verbally counseled you about the
cameras.

TAYLOR
Okay, Sarge. My bad.

Sarge pulls away. Zavala and Taylor trade looks.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
That explains so much.

ZAVALA
Hope he don't get his rookie
pregnant. Then we'll never get
rid of him. Gonna put your stupid
cameras away now?

TAYLOR
No.

Taylor lifts his binocs. Watching the street.

A fancy pick-up truck stops at a house. A big MEXICAN
COWBOY gets out. A WOMAN exits the house and gives hima
heavy pot, presumably of soup...

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Isn't that Big Evil's mom?

ZAVALA
Yep. Who's the cowboy?

TAYLOR
He's got money. See that truck?
I'm running it.

Zavala is already pulling out. Taylor doesn't have to

Taylor pulls his weapon -- SMASHES the passenger window
of the pick-up with his Glock and screws it into the
Cowboy's ear...

TAYLOR
Suelta la pistola o te vuelo los

The Cowboy knows he's been had. And drops his pistol...

Zavala rips his door open and hauls the man to the ground
and cuffs him. Taylor sees no one else is in the truck.
He keys his mic...

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Thirteen-Adam-Thirteen. Man with
a gun. Shots fired. Code four.
One in custody. Request a
supervisor.

To Zavala:

TAYLOR (CONT'D)

ZAVALA
No. I got him, toss the truck.

Zavala picks up the man's custom pistol -- Diamond
encrusted with ivory grips.

ZAVALA (CONT'D)

takes something out he hadn't seen before and holds it up
so Zavala can see...

TAYLOR

her. You guys never fight.
You're happy together.

ZAVALA
All of the above. I'm just

anyone else. Ain't even kissed

JANET
Can I hold him?

A beat. Every new mom is VERY protective. Gabby smiles.
Nods: yes. Janet carefully takes the newborn in her
arms.

GABBY'S MOM
See, mija? That's how you hold a
baby.
Janet gently rocks the baby, cooing and smiling. The
infant grabs her nose. She loves kids. Zavala looks at
Taylor and grins...

You are so done.

Taylor looks at Zavala. And knows he's right.

L.A. MAYOR
Officers Brian Taylor and Officer
Miguel Zavala were on routine
patrol in the six hundred block of
Twenty-Sixth street when they saw
smoke and flame coming from a fire
at a house. A woman exited the
house and told the officers that
her children were inside. Without
waiting for the fire department
and without protective equipment,
the officers entered the burning
structure at great personal risk.
The officers, working as a team,
rescued the woman's twin sons.
Upon exiting the house, they
learned that an additional child
was inside. They reentered what
was now an inferno and feeling
their way through the smoke found
the woman's daughter and saved the
child from certain death. For
their selfless actions and
exemplary service to the citizens
of this city, the department is
proud to award Officer Taylor and
Officer Zavala the department's
highest award; the Medal of Valor.

Now the CHIEF OF POLICE hangs medals around the necks of
Taylor and Zavala and shakes their whitegloved hands.

The two officers return to their place in the line of
recipients, verily glowing. Even to the hardest cop it's
a great feeling.
Gabby can't help it, she screams...
GABBY
We love you, Mike!

ZAVALA
I've known Brian since the
academy. He helped me with the
coursework. And I helped harden
him up so he could pass PT. I
don't really like cops. Maybe
‘cause of where I grew up. But
Brian was cool so I figured we
should work patrol together. You
sit in a car with the same dude
watch after watch and you know
them. And the second I saw him
with Janet, I'm like that's it.
She's his lady. So I'm not
surprised to be here. Just that
it took so long. And Janet, you
got a lot of heart hooking up with
acop. You gotta be a strong
person. I see a lot of cops'
wives here and they're all nodding
their heads. We're all hoping
that you can make a man out of
Brian because we've given up.

Don't give me that look. Brother,
you take care of her. ‘Cause I'm

door...

WHAM! -- Zavala kicks it open and they rush inside...

No dice. We're trapped.

Taylor pulls out his cellphone...
TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Shit. I got no bars. You call
dispatch.
ZAVALA
My phone's in the car.
(to the Young Mother)
Dame tu telephone.

She hands Zavala her cellphone. Zavala dials as Taylor
covers the door...

TAYLOR
Senora. Bajase al suelo, por
favor.

The Young Mother takes his advise and lays down on the
floor...

Right then...

ZAVALA
Just don't let her date cops.

One time Gabby's parents bounced
to Ensenada and her brother
crashed at his girlfriends so I
spend the night at her house.
This was gonna be the night. The
night. Know what I'm saying?

TAYLOR
Yes.

ZAVALA
So we're in her parent's bed. And
it's on. It's about to go down.
I'm pulling her chones off--

TAYLOR
--chones?

ZAVALA
Her skivvies, dog. And I'm like
finally, right? Fucking finally.
But we hear this noise. Like
someone's in the pad. We figure
it's her brother so I hide under
the bed. Dude. It was her
parents. This is the second
floor. I got nowhere to go.
Homegirl tries to distract them
but it ain't happening. I'm under
their bed. And they crash. And
this is the part I never told
Gabby. They did it. They got
down. I'm talking Gabby's
parents. That shit was traumatic.
Finally at like two A.M. they fall
asleep. So I do a commando crawl
and escape.

Zavala can barely contain his laughter...

TAYLOR
Must of been a little
uncomfortable around the folks
after that.

ZAVALA
Bro. Her old man is a freak.
Straight up. I guess you been
