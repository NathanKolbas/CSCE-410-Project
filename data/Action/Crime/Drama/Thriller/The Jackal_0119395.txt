It's late. CRICKETS sing, moths circle the lichts over the
pier as the Jackal's minivan pulls up next to Deja Vu. Her
cargo hatch is open. Standing in the cockpit, the Jackal
unscrews the plate at the end of the boom. The inside is
hollow. The Jackal lifts the zSU-33 cannon into the hollow
space, pushing it in and re-attaching the end plate...

EXT. OPEN LAKE - DAY

Sails furled, Deja Vu drifts far out in Lake Michigan, no
land in sight. The Jackal walks aft, pulling a paper cover
from the transom. The name Deja Vu has been replaced by
‘Insolent Minx.', port of call, Chicago. The Jackal admires
his handiwork, crumpling the transfer paper ané tossing it
into the lake. He returns to the cockpit and pushes a pair
of buttons. The mainsail and jib unfurl on hydraulic
rollers, wind instantly filling them. Insolent Minx and her
deadly cargo are airborne, heading for Chicago. The Jackal
takes a cellular phone and punches in a set of numbers.

He nods. She takes his tray and piles his food on top of
hers. Declan smiles, looking back out the window. A BURST of
appreciative LAUGHTER from the FBI agents at another table
as on TV, Brown escorts the reassuringly matronly FIRST LADY
to the podium. She gets off a quip and a sweet ripple of
tinkling female laughter passes through the audience. Declan
smiles fondly. Valentina points to Brown:

sailboat transoms--most are locally-registered. None look
remotely suspicious.

VALENTINA
I'll check this way.

Valentina walks to the adjacent pier. FIREWORKS continue to
bang and pop as Declan keeps searching here at pier 28. At
the next one, pier 29, the Jackal's minivan, now green, is
parked about 50 yards from the Insolent Minx. There's no
sign of him on deck or on the pier. Valentina passes within
50 feet of the vehicle, but does not check it ouc. Walking
down pier 28, Declan examines boats from Chicago, Milwaukee,

EXT. HIGHWAY REST AREA - EVENING 128

 

Road flares sputter, lining the Interstate, and traffic has
slowed to a crawl. A burly state TROOPER directs a passing
into the rest area, the parking lot of which is filled with
minivans--it looks like every minivan in Virginia is being
stopped. Declan and Preston sit against the fender of a
police cruiser, watching as STATE TROOPERS search vehicles
and interview DRIVERS. The portable cellular phone in
Preston's coat WARBLES. He flips it open and answers.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 139

Chest heaving and fluttering involuntarily, Valentina lies
in the middle of the living room floor, the PARAMEDICS
clustered around her working feverishly to kesp her alive.
She lifts her head slightly as Declan enters. He gasps,
seeing in an instant there's no hope, and rushes to her.

DECLAN

Valya!
VALENTINA

Declan... I tried...protect Isabella--
DECLAN

Please, Valya... don't talk.
Valentina grabs his hand. She's holding out on sheer will.
VALENTINA
My words made him angry...said tell

A paramedic bends down, preparing a hypodermic needle:

Please, move back and let us work...

Declan moves back. Valentina groans miserabiy, anguished at
knowing she's about to die among strangers. clan suddenly
explodes, hurling the paramedics back, clearing them away.

 

DECLAN
Get away from her! Leave her alone!

A policeman moves to intervene but Preston stcos him. The
paramedics back off. Declan takes Valentina in his arms,

She nods again and for a moment time seems to stand still as
he lifts her and presses close, running a hand through her
hair. Then he kisses her, tenderly, deeply, with a lover's
ardor, romantic and powerful, a magnificent kiss. She sighs,
tenderly grateful for this stolen moment of beauty. Then,
tears welling up in her loving eyes, she breathes her last
breath into him...

Declan lowers her body back down. Lying there in death, pale
as alabaster with the color drained from her, the lividness
of her scar fades to almost nothing and we see her as she
might have looked, rare, sensitive--and unutterably
beautiful. Closing his eyes and hanging his head, Declan
begins to weep...

EXT. ISABELLA'S HOUSE - LATER 140

Isabella returns, making her way past cops and FBI agents to
the living room as ambulance attendants haul away the body,
spotting Declan standing in a corner with Preston. He has
known much grief in his life, but at this moment he seems
utterly inconsolable. Preston fades away as she appears at
Declan's side, putting her arms around him.

ISABELLA
She said it was her job. I said she was
a fool. But if it weren't for her, that
would be me and my babies lying there.
(pauses, shakes head)

They're placing us into Witness
Protection. They said there's too much
chance of my real identity getting out.

DECLAN
Yes, that's good... I'm sorry, Isabella.

ISABELLA
So am I. For all of this. Such a woman...

Declan nods, looking down at his hands. Surreptitiously,
Isabella pulls him over to the fireplace, reaches up into
the chimney, and retrieves a 14-shot Browning 9mm AUTOMATIC
PISTOL hidden there, wrapped in plastic. She holds it out.
He looks at it, ther her. She looks him right in the eye.

guarding the wrong person. Here, look...

Declan shows Preston a page 20 Washington Post item: "FIRST
LADY TO OPEN CHILDREN'S CHEMO UNIT." PULL IN on Declan and
Preston until their facces fill the entire frame:

DECLAN :
He's after the First Lady.

PRESTON
What?

DECLAN
It always bothered me why he kept
coming. He knew we could protect the
Director, especially once I was
involved. But he didn't abort, he kepz
coming--that's ‘because we were guarding
the wrong person. It didn't come
together until I saw her on television
and remembered: I can't protect my
women. That's what he said to Valya. She
got him mad and he let it slip--maybe on
purpose, to tease us. You told me. The
killing has to be a statement, public
and brutal.

PRESTON
Wasn't, he referring to Isabella?

DECLAN
Ostensibly, but he meant any woman, all
women, the woman. He's not out to make a
statement, he's out to commit an
obscenity, an obscenity against the

No! Tell them to sweep the area but

Dennehy looks appalled, but he gets back on the radio.

PRESTON
If you're right, what's he waiting for?

DECLAN
The TV cameras will go to a live hocx-up

much more public and brutal than the

EXT. PARK - DAY 162

The Jackal sees a PATROL CAR driving slowly down the road
toward his van. He leaves his equipment and waiks, brisk and

-confident, to intercept the car, waving. A COP leans out.

COP
You get the word? They're looking for a
green minivan. Anything out of place.

JACKAL
Only minivan around here is that yellow
one. It's got a local parking permit. I
looked it over. Nothin’.

COP
Yeah, whole thing's probably a "be

The chopper descends to an apartment rooftop near the
hospital and Declan, Preston, and Dennehey jump out.
Cradling a Winchester Model 700, Akashi is the last man out.
The helicopter roars away. Preston yells to Declan.

what he's looking for.

DECLAN
Green minivan on the hillside by the
grove of trees. Eleven o'clock, across
the parkway. See it?

AKASHI
Hang on, eleven o'clock...

Akashi looks where he's told, straining to find the target.
Through his scope, the minivan is parked almost 1500 yards
away. The rear doors are open and the evil barrel of the

cannon shows plainly. Suddenly spotting it, Akashi recoils.

AKASHT

Declan brings his hand up to the stock of the weapon and
lets out a long breath.

DECLAN
Range it...

Akashi hits a button on his rifle scope. The distance is
impossible.

The tunnel is interfering with reception...

Jackal hears his footsteps and moves into the narrow
partition between the tracks, ducking behind a small supgort
beam, ready to ambush Declan...

Declan continues down the track...

The Jackal makes out something in the darkness. But suddenly
the LIGHTS of ANOTHER TRAIN appear, illuminating both Declan
and Jackal~-they see each other at the same instant...

Declan hits the dirt as Jackal FIRES, just missing him.
Declan FIRES twice at the Jackal before the train HURTLES
by. Once again, a train is between them. Seeing that Declan
can't follow, the Jackal continues toward the distant
of the next station at a dead run. On the other side of

The Jackal takes the gun muzzle away from the girl's head
and points it at Declan instead. Suddenly dead calm:

The Jackal's neck BURSTS into red mist. He FIRES reflexively
as he falls, hitting Declan in the shoulder while the little

funereal black, fearsome and tremendous, dark eves flashing
like the sword of justice.

The Jackal fumbles for his gun but Declan leaps to his feet
and kicks it away from him. The Jackal sits up, looking at
Declan in the most utter disbelief, doubting his very
senses, eyes saying, “A woman?", followed by his voice:

JACKAL
