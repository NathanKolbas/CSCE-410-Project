EXT. HILL - DAY

A STILL IMAGE/PHOTOGRAPH of a man, ERIC, 44 years old, sitting ona
country hill under a lone tree beside a brown dog.

They both look happy.

ERIC (V.0.)
I can't say I even know what the world is
anymore. I don’t know what happened to it.
I don't even know where it is now, I don't
know where its centre is, if it even has a
centre... All I know is that its dirty
people have crawled out here somehow. I
don't know why. I don't really care anymore
anyway. And that's all I'm gonna say about
it.

CUT TO BLACK:

CARD ON BLACK: "Australia. Some time in the future."

INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

Eric sits at the wheel of his parked car. He's not happy like the
photo. Some kind of ennui. He stares ahead, lost in thought, lost in
something. Outside the car is all searing light and blank brown
Australian landscape.

He stares ahead listlessly a while, then opens the car door and
climbs out.

EXT. KHMER DINER - DAY

Eric heads over to a scrappy roadside diner. The diner has a big
dirty sign out front in Khmer/Cambodian script.

The walk is blinding. The surrounding area is desolate. The diner
stands alone, a dirty nowhere stop on a stretch of traffic-less
road.

Eric wears an old button-down shirt with sleeves rolled over knee-
length shorts and dirty trainers. He is wiry thin. He has short-
cropped hair and a goatee ruling over a three day growth.

INT. KHMER DINER - DAY

Eric steps into the dark and musty diner. A Cambodian pop song plays
on the stereo. It's really unnecessarily loud.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
2.
CONTINUED:

The place is empty except for three Cambodian guys sitting on a
bench in a back corner. One is asleep. The other two watch Eric
close as he enters. One has a shotgun resting across his lap.

Eric crosses to a rear bathroom.
INT. KHMER DINER / BATHROOM - DAY

Eric cups his hands into a bucket of water beside a dirty sink that
has long ago had its faucets removed. He drenches his face. He
brushes his teeth roughly with his finger and rinses his mouth with
one cupped handful from the bucket. He spits the water into the
sink.

He dries his face with his shirt sleeve and looks at himself in the
mirror. His self-examination is strangely detached. Something
broken. Something dark and hard.

INT. KHMER DINER - DAY

Eric walks back through the diner. The Cambodians watch him, wary
but calm, Bric meets their eyes. The air is inhospitable but
lethargic.

Eric takes a seat at the counter. He reaches over and helps himself
to a tall glass of green tea from a big chrome thermos.

He sits here, in the din of pop music, sipping his tea.

He sits with his back to a big picture window behind him looking out
onto the desert and empty road out front of the diner.

And then, barely audible over the stereo, a CAR comes cart-wheeling
across frame, outside, across the window behind him.

It's a huge and ferocious CRASH.

One of the Cambodian guys stands. The sleeping guy stays sleeping on
the bench, The standing guy moves towards the door, not sure what he
saw. The other one follows, they exchange a few words in Khmer.

Eric turns slowly to look out the window, not concerned enough to
move, not really knowing what he heard, if he heard anything at all.

Eric stays put, dust still settling through the window behind him.
He reaches over the bar and turns the stereo off. The room drops to
silence,

Eric doesn't register concern until he hears the sound of his
Falcon's engine starting.

 

 
EXT, KHMER DINER ~ DAY
Eric rushes out the front door. Dust hangs in the air.

Someone is already behind the wheel of his car ~ another two guys
stagger from the wreck of the rolled car and head for the Falcon.

Eric runs for his car, reaching it just as the passenger door slams
shut. He slaps on the windows as the Falcon screeches away.

Eric is left standing, breathing dust. He starts running down the
road after them.

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET - DAY

REYNOLDS, late 20s, lies bleeding in the middle of a small, desolate
town street. He tries to catch his breath. His mid-section is blood-
soaked. He clutches a handgun.

Ten metres away, also in the road, a uniformed cop lies in a pool of
blood, gasping last breaths through his gun-blasted throat. His gun
lies a few feet away beside his cop car.

No one else is in the street. A face pokes through blinds to see the
battered men outside,

Reynolds, lying in the street, turns his head to see the dying cop
through bitumen heat haze.

The cop is groaning sickeningly.

Reynolds heaves himself over onto his back to look over at the cop,
who now lies in a serious pool of blood and gore.

Reynolds starts dragging himself, still clutching his gun, along the
road towards the cop and his car. It's a major, painful struggle.
The bitumen is brutally hot.

The cop, groaning himself into death, lies between Reynolds and the
cop car. As Reynolds pulls himself closer, the cop looks over to him
with imploring, traumatised eyes.

DYING COP
(gurgles)
Help me.

Reynolds' progress is slow and pained. The cop is paralyzed. He
gurgles and wheezes as Reynolds crawls past.

From the windows of nearby buildings, people peer at the scene in

the street, too frightened of the armed carnage to offer any
assistance.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

 
4.
CONTINUED:

Reynolds continues his slow crawl past a building directly beside
the scene. Its door is open. Inside lie two shotgun—blasted bodies,
their eyes open, victims of whatever it is that has just happened
here.

Reynolds finally reaches the cop car.

He heaves himself up into the driver's seat. The radio crackles the
odd indiscernible word,

Reynolds wipes sweat from his eyes and reaches down to the key still
hanging from the ignition, He starts the engine, pulls the door shut
and shoves the car into gear.

INT. COMMODORE - DAY
Three men in a-roaring Commodore. They're frantic.
They're American with Southern accents.

HENRY
(in passenger seat)
Turn the fuckin car around.

CALEB
(driving)
We can't turn around.

ARCHIE
(in backseat)
He's gone, cuz.

HENRY, late-30s, is twisted in the front seat, looking out through
the back windshield.

HENRY
He was still moving, goddamit. I could see
him still moving.

ARCHIE
He's gone, cuz. He's gone.

CALEB
What is it we're s'posed to do? We can't
go back. What are we s'posed to do?

HENRY
This money ain't fuckin worth it to me to
leave him there.

ARCHIE
It ain't just about you.

(CONTINUED)

 
CONTINUED:

HENRY
Turn the fuckin car around.
ARCHIE
It ain't just about what's worth it to you.
HENRY
(to Caleb)

What if it was you lying there? What if we
done it to you?

CALEB
I'd have to accept it.

HENRY
God damn it. Don't lie. Don't fuckin lie.

CALEB
ave to accept my fate. I'd have to.
ave to accept my fate like a man,

ARCHIE
And there's the thing, right there. I told
you this would happen. You can't go
anywhere without your brother and I very
almost got my head blown off because of him
because he can't handle himself.

Archie in the backseat, sweating and agitated.

ARCHIE (CONT’D)
If he could handle himself, we wouldn't be
in this situation. But so then now look
what happens to him, And I can't be feeling
responsible for that. If he was a man who
could look after himself, he'd be accepting
his fate right now.

Henry is suddenly enraged. He twists, swinging and grabbing into the

backseat.

HENRY
Say that again.

Archie squirms out of Henry's reach in the backseat. Henry bumps
Caleb behind the wheel. The car swerves on the road.

CALEB
(struggling with the wheel)
Fuckin sit down.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
CONTINUED: (2)

ARCHIE
You heard me, And you know it too. If he
was a man, he wouldn't be crying about it
and you wouldn't be crying about it coz
he'd be accepting his fate right now.

Henry drills Archie angrily.

HENRY
Say that again.

ARCHIE
I just did, cuz. I said it twice,

HENRY
Say it again!
ARCHIE
If I said it again, I'd say it the exact
same way and that'd be three times I said
it. Stop your fuckin crying.
Henry makes a big lunge at Archie who has squirmed into the farthest
corner of the backseat. Henry's knee goes straight into Caleb's
kidneys. Caleb recoils in pain. He loses control of the car.
EXT. COMMODORE ~- DAY

The car fishtails dangerously, then goes into a wild cacophonous
roll right out front of a Khmer diner in the middle of nowhere.

The car comes to a dusty, creaking rest on its side - only a few
yards from a black Falcon.

INT. COMMODORE - DAY

The men in the wreck orient themselves, heave for breath, cough and
check for injuries. The car is on its side - they hang in awkward,
strained positions.

CALEB
Is anyone dead?

Henry and Archie cough negative. Henry starts crawling out his
window that points to the sky.

EXT. KHMER DINER ~- DAY

Henry pulls himself up out of the car, balancing precariously on its
doors.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
7.
CONTINUED:

He reaches a hand down to lift Caleb out from the driver's seat.
Caleb squirms free and then reaches back in. He emerges again with a
shotgun, then jumps down onto to the dirt beside the Commodore.
He makes an immediate limping move for the black Falcon nearby.

Henry shuffles over on the car to the back door and reaches in for
Archie.

HENRY
Pass me the bag.

A dirty blue bag appears through the window hole. Henry slings it
over his shoulder, then jumps down off the car, leaving Archie to
heave himself out of the wreck.

They jump down onto the dirt as Caleb fires the Falcon's ignition.
It roars to life.

Henry and Archie hobble over to it.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON ~ DAY
Archie climbs in the back seat.

Henry jumps in the passenger seat and pulls the door shut - just
as Eric appears beside it.

Eric bangs on the window, hollering.
EXT. KHMER DINER - DAY

The Falcon tears away, leaving Eric stumbling and showered with
dust.

Eric runs after it, out onto the road, and chases on foot for a few
futile metres.

He stops in the middle of the road, frantic. He looks around him,
back towards the diner.

The Cambodian onlookers stand useless in the sun.

Eric runs back towards the diner.

He runs round behind the rolled Commodore, still on its side, and
heaves against its roof, rocking it, until it lurches back down,
right way up.

Its roof is half caved in at the back. Eric wrenches the driver's
door open and climbs behind the wheel.

(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:

He fires the ignition, He reverses it crazily out of the diner
parking lot and rears out onto the road.

I/E, COMMODORE ~ DAY

MOMENTS LATER, Eric behind the wheel is hammering the Commodore down
a scorching hot desert road. Despite its bang-up, the car is still
mean. Its engine growls.

The road ahead is hazy and empty.

Eric's face and body are full concentration. He pushes the car hard.

And then, in the distance, he can make out the distinct shape of his
Falcon up ahead.

Eric pushes the Commodore even harder. It now sounds like it's
struggling, over~revving.

The gap narrows. Eric concentrates on nothing else.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON = DAY
Henry, Caleb and Archie ride oblivious to Eric's fast approach.

They don't talk. They are shaken and exhausted. The radio is on. Its
reception is crackly bad. Broken unintelligible CB radio chatter.

I/E. COMMODORE ~ DAY

Eric is now only a hundred metres from the Falcon and gaining fast.
He's almost there.

INT, ERIC'S FALCON ~ DAY

Caleb looks up into the rearview mirror. He can see Eric behind him,
approaching hard.

CALEB
What's he doing?

Archie turns in his seat to look out through the back windshield.
Henry sits dark and stoney-faced, staring ahead.

ARCHIE
That's the Commodore.

CALEB
What?

(CONTINUED)

 

 
CONTINUED:
ARCHIE
It's the Commodore.
CALEB
What do you mean it's the Commodore?
ARCHIE
It's our Commodore. It's the one we were

in.
Archie squints through the back windshield.
ARCHIE (CONT‘D)
It is, cuz. It's the Commodore. It’s bashed
in like when we left it back there.
I/E. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric pushes the gas even harder.

He is now right on top of them. He's pushing it, only metres away
from the Falcon, tailgating it hard.

He can see Archie's face peering at him through the back windshield,
INT. ERIC'S FALCON ~ DAY

Caleb is seriously concerned. The Commodore is dangerously close
behind them.

CALEB
Who's in it?
Archie strains to see through the filthy windshield and heat haze.
ARCHIE
It's the guy. It's the guy who was all

slapping on the window when we took off in
this,

Henry glances in his side mirror.

HENRY
We're in his car.

CALEB
What? And he wants it back now?

HENRY
That's what it looks like.

 
10.

I/E. COMMODORE ~- DAY

Eric pushes it even harder, giving the gas another hard squirt. The
engine squeals.

The Commodore surges, closing the last gap between it and the
Falcon.

Eric is now tailgating the Falcon tight and dangerous.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON ~- DAY

Caleb and Archie are frantic as the Commodore comes within
centimetres of brushing the Falcon's back bumper.

Archie jumps as the Commodore surges.

ARCHIE
Jesus.

Caleb is struggling with the wheel, glancing back and forth between
the rearview and the road ahead.

CALEB
What the fuck is this guy's situation?
What's going on?
Henry is strangely calm, eyes fixed on the road ahead.
I/E. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric lets off the gas a touch, dropping back a couple of feet, then
floors it again, pulling around the side of the Falcon.

INT. BRIC'S FALCON - DAY

Eric brings the Commodore up level with Caleb at the wheel and yells
through the open passenger window.

ERIC
Pull over!

Caleb can't believe the temerity of this guy. He yells back through
his open window.

CALEB
You fuckin nut!

Caleb pulls a handgun from the front of his pants and points it
straight across at Eric.

Eric hits the brake and slips back a few feet.

 

 

 

 
il.

I/E. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric holds the Commodore in the Falcon's blind spot, a few feet
behind Caleb's window.

INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

In the backseat, Archie checks his handgun and then leans out his
window with it.

I/E. COMMODORE - DAY
Eric sees Archie and the gun pointed straight at him.

Eric swerves the car. Archie fires. The bullet ricochets off the
roof of the Commodore.

The Falcon swerves too, Caleb flinching at the blast.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON ~ DAY
Caleb resettles the wheel.
CALEB
Let me know you're gonna do that before you
do that.
Archie fires again.
I/E. COMMODORE - DAY

Archie's bullet ricochets off the hood of the Commodore,

Eric hits the brakes hard, dropping the Commodore back a hundred
metres behind the Falcon.

He then hits the gas again, holding the distance.
Archie shoots again. The Commodore is too far behind.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

Archie fires again. Caleb is searching his rearview, observing the
Commodore's retreat,

CALEB
Is he giving up?

ARCHIE
He ain't givin' up. He's holding it there.

Through the back windshield they can see the Commodore holding
steady, keeping pace a hundred metres behind them.

 

 

 

 

 
12.

INT. COMMODORE ~ DAY

Eric holds it steady. He checks the Commodore's fuel gauge. It's
half-full. He can afford to be patient.

INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

Caleb continues checking the rearview. The radio's still playing,
the reception's getting worse.

Henry switches it off.

CALEB
What's he doing?

HENRY
He wants his car back.

Henry is calm, almost admiring of Eric's tenacity.
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

The two cars continue their high speed stand-off. The distance
between them doesn't shift an inch.

INT. COMMODORE - DAY
Eric keeps his eyes glued on his Falcon on the road ahead.
EXT, DESERT ROAD - DAY

The cars take a long subtle bend in the road, Their engines roar.
Their drivers push them hard. They're going dangerously fast.

INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

Caleb's looking in his rearview. Henry sits contemplative, looking
straight ahead. He seems mournful.

 

Archie's still craning his neck around, looking out the back
windshield.

ARCHIE
He's not goin' nowhere. He's just gonna
keep following us.
Caleb looks down at the fuel gauge. It‘s not far from empty.

CALEB
He's got more fuel than we do. He knows it.

Caleb checks the rearview again, then looks straight ahead,
thinking.

 

{CONTINUED )
13.
CONTINUED:

A few moments pass.

HENRY
Stop the car.

CALEB
What?

HENRY

I wanna see him.

CALEB
What do you mean you wanna see him?

HENRY
Stop the car.

Caleb presses the brakes.
I/E. COMMODORE - DAY
Eric can see the Falcon's brake lights snap red and the car slow.

He hits the Commodore's brakes hard. Its tires squeal on the
bitumen,

EXT. DESERT ROAD ~ DAY

Both cars come to a halt on the barren road. They're about fifty
Metres apart.

They sit, engines humming in otherwise relative silence broken only
by the screech of an eagle.

The dust settles, blowing in a light wind off the road.
INT. ERIC'S FALCON - DAY

Caleb and Archie both crane around to look out the back
windshield.

Henry adjusts the stationary Falcon's rearview mirror. He watches
the Commodore idle, dusty in the distance.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
The cars sit on the road, Engines growling. No movement.

Then the Commodore's brake lights ease off as it begins a slow move
towards the Falcon.

 

 

 
14.

INT. ERIC'S FALCON ~ DAY

Caleb and Archie watch through the back windshield, Henry in the
rearview,

ARCHIE
He's movin',

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

The Commodore moves real slow, inching its way towards the Falcon,
narrowing the gap between them.

INT. ERIC'S PALCON - DAY
Henry watches the rearview. The Commodore moves closer.

ARCHIE
This guy doesn't wanna be alive no more.

CALEB
Doesn't seem like he does.

Archie checks his handgun. They watch the Commodore's slow approach
until it's only a rock throw behind them.

And then Henry, his eyes having not left the rearview mirror,
reaches for the door's handle and opens it.

EXT. DESERT ROAD ~ DAY

Henry climbs out of the Falcon and stands beside it, watching Eric
inch closer.

A few moments later, Archie climbs out too. Caleb stays inside,
watching through the windshield,

The Commodore stops about twenty metres away.

Henry can barely see Eric inside through its filthy windshield, but
they are staring each other down nonetheless.

INT, COMMODORE - DAY

Eric sits behind the wheel and watches the two men standing beside
his car,

Henry reaches back in the car and pulls out his shotgun.

Eric opens the Commodore's door.

 

 
15.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

Eric climbs out of the Commodore and stands beside it a moment. The
men watch each other. Henry lets the shotgun hang loose by his side.

Eric walks slow towards them.

HENRY
What's going on with you, brother?

Eric doesn't respond. He keeps walking until he's only a few metres
away.

ERIC
I want my car back.

HENRY
I can see that.

They stand staring each other down for a moment.

HENRY (CONT'D)
You ain't gettin' it back.

Eric takes a few steps closer.

ERIC
I want it back.

HENRY
Yeah, I heard you. And I'm bettin’ you
heard me too.

ERIC
I don't care who you are. I want my car
back. If you don't give it to me now, I'm
gonna get back in that Commodore and I'm
gonna stay on you til you do.

HENRY
What makes you think I won't kill you
here?

ERIC
Nothing makes me think that. I'd welcome
it.

Eric watches Henry a moment, It's a strange, long moment. It makes
Henry uncomfortable.

Eric takes steps closer again.

(CONTINUED)

 
16.
CONTINUED:

ARCHIE
You must really love this Falcon, cuz.

Eric ignores Archie, moving towards Henry, their eyes locked on each
other. Henry is deeply unsettled. Eric carries a dangerous nothing-
to-lose air.

Archie points his handgun at the back panel of the Falcon.

ARCHIE (CONT'D)
How'd it be if I put holes in it?

Eric wheels around and grabs Archie by the throat with one hand, his
gan hand with the other, slamming him against the car.

Henry flips the shotgun around and clubs Eric over the back of the
head with its butt,

Eric's forehead smacks straight into Archie's face. Eric falls to
the road, out cold,

Archie buckles over, moaning, clutching his face and catching his
breath. Caleb stands at the driver's door.

Henry steps over to Eric and pokes him with the shotgun's barrel,
then flips him over onto his back with his boot,

EXT. DESERT ~ DAY
The sun is high and hot. Glare and rippling air.

From a distance we see a tree. And from the tree a figure hangs by
its feet.

Eric wakes. He has been tied round the ankles and hung from a branch
of the dying tree.

He struggles groggy, disoriented. He looks filthy and sun-damaged.

After a moment, collecting himself, he looks up at his rope
shackles. He heaves himself up to inspect them. He manages to grab
the branch and hang, bent hard at the waist. It's awkward and
exhausting. He lets the branch go and jerks back upside down,
swaying.

Big black birds loiter coldly. Some stare. Others preen,
disinterested.

They can wait.
Eric heaves himself up again, hanging by one hand, picking at the

rope with the other. But the rope is tight and heavy. He won't have
the strength to loosen it.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
17.
CONTINUED:

He quits picking and breathes hard and confused.

As he hangs, one of the big black birds lands right beside his feet,
staring down at him. Eric stares back, quietly desperate. They hold
the stare until the bird looks away.

And as it does, Eric lunges. His hand strikes like a snake. He has
the bird by the feet. It panics and flaps. .

Eric flops back down again, hanging by his feet as the bird squawks
and squirms. He grabs its body and looks at it a moment before
snapping its neck swiftly.

He hangs there a moment longer, the now dead bird dangling. He then
lifts himself up again and goes to work on the rope, hacking at it
with bird's big brutal beak.

Again from a distance, we watch Eric work. He strains and hacks
until finally the rope gives and he falls heavy to the dirt.

Eric sits, catching his breath, gathering himself. He looks out
across the desert to the horizon, then drops his face into his now
bloody hands,

He's exhausted.

He lifts himself up and limps towards the Commodore which sits idle
a distance away. He climbs behind the wheel, starts the engine, ;
shifts it into gear and turns it around back onto the highway. i

EXT. CARNY TOWN / STREET - DAY

Reynolds cruises into town in the stolen cop car. The town is little
more than a bunch of busted buildings in the middle of nothing.

The street is empty of people, but there are a number of trucks and
vans parked behind buildings on one side of it.

INT. REYNOLDS CAR - DAY

Reynolds is struggling and bleeding badly. There's blood all over
the dash and all over the steering wheel. Blood pools in the
driver's seat around him,

He wipes his forehead, smearing blood all over his face. It gets in
his eyes, stinging them,

He reaches over to the passenger seat and grabs a little yellow :
dress piled with other women's clothes. He wipes his face with it,
getting the blood out of his eyes.

When he opens them, he spots a gas station a little further down the
street.
18.

EXT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION - DAY

Reynolds pulls the cop car round the side of the gas station
building, obscured from main-street sight. He opens the car door and
practically spills out onto the gravel beside it.

He leaves the door open and staggers over to the toilet attached to
the gas station.

It's hellishly hot and deathly quiet.
INT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION TOILET ~- DAY

Reynolds heaves open the door. Blinding light screams into the dark
and foul toilet. Flies buzz.

Reynolds staggers in. The door swings and slams closed. It's
suddenly pitch black inside.

We can hear Reynolds' hand slapping the tiled wall, looking for a
light switch.

The room flickers alight under a nasty fluorescent tube.

Reynolds eases himself over to the sink, In the mirror, under this
light, he looks like bloody death.

He lifts his shirt off, almost too delirious to wince with pain.
Under the shirt he is a scary, bloody mess.

He cups his hands into the water bucket beside the sink. He splashes
it over his torso, trying to clear the gore and isolate his wounds.

After a few splashes the bullet wound is clear, on the side of his
abdomen. It dribbles more blood,

He presses his bloody shirt against it. His legs begin to give way.
He sits heavily on the dank bathroom floor, leaning back against the
wall, holding the shirt to his gut.

His eyes close.

EXT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION - DAY

Eric's Commodore limps into the same gas station and pulls up only
metres away from Reynolds’ cop car.

Eric notes it warily.
He gets out, looking again to the cop car with its driver's door

ajar. He sees the blood pooled in the driver's seat. He heads for
the gas station door.

 

 
19.

INT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION - DAY
Eric steps inside. A little bell rings as the door opens. The gas
station is dusty and dark. Store shelves are mainly empty. The few
bits and pieces on them are faded and filthy.
Eric walks the length of one of the shelves. He rounds the corner to
find an OLD GUY with tattoos on his knuckles standing behind the
counter pointing a pump-action shotgun straight at him.
Eric stops.
OLD GUY
(listless)
Raise your hands up.
Eric raises his hands slowly.

OLD GUY (CONT'D)
OK, now lift your shirt. Slow.

Eric lifts his shirt up over his belt, exposing his bare stomach.

 

OLD GUY (CONT'D)
Now turn. Full all the way round, Slow.

Eric turns a full circle, holding his shirt up.

OLD GUY (CONT'D)
Thank you. What can I do for you?

The old guy keeps the gun trained on Eric.
ERIC

I'm looking for a black Falcon. With three
people in it.

OLD GUY
It hasn't stopped here,
ERIC
They needed gas.
OLD GUY
I haven't got any gas. There's a sign out
front.
ERIC

Did you see it?

OLD GUY
Did I see the sign? I put it there.

 

(CONTINUED )
20.

CONTINUED:
ERIC
The Falcon, Did it drive past here?
OLD GUY
I haven't seen a Falcon. Do you want to buy

something?

Eric doesn't answer. The old man stands, still pointing the shotgun,
waist-high, at Eric. There's a strange neediness in his eyes.

OLD GUY (CONT'D)
I've got sandwiches and cold drinks and
auto accessories and some other things.
Eric turns and heads for the door.
EXT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION - DAY

Eric steps out into the heat. He looks up and down the street. It's
deserted,

A hundred metres down he can see the two-storey Hanging Garden
Hotel. An old 19th century building with an iron balcony.

The ground floor door to its public bar is open. A shirtless,
tattooed man stands outside on the pavement, pissing into the
street.

Eric starts walking towards him.

The pissing man concentrates on his stream of piss, then looks up to
see Eric approaching from across the street.

Eric walks, the man pisses. They watch each other.

The guy zips his pants. He spits in the gutter where he pissed and
then casually heads back inside the hotel.

INT. HANGING GARDEN HOTEL - DAY
Eric walks through the door to the public bar.

Inside, about ten guys mill around at the bar, at tables, a couple
sleep against a wall. Most seem to have busted teeth and tattoos.

It's a weird crowd. A couple of lithe Chinese teenagers dressed in T-
shirts and tracksuit pants with their hair in Imperial Chinese
plaits play backgammon with a midget.

Every now and then the Chinese boys let out a squealing, cackling

laugh. It breaks the lethargic silence in the hotel, strange and
chilling.

(CONTINUED )

 
21.
CONTINUED:

Despite the crowd, there isn't much noise. A radio hisses tinny in
the corner, barely audible. It's not playing music or talkback -
more scrambled intercepted radio communication.

Only a couple of people bother to look up at Eric as he enters. But
that couple look up darkly.

Eric crosses to the bar.
The bartender is a wiry, shirtless twelve-year-old BOY with greasy
hair and dirt on his face. There's something oddly, sexually
androgenous about him.
ERIC

I'm looking for a black Falcon with three

people in it.
The boy looks at Eric like he hasn't heard him speak.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Have you seen it?

The boy shakes his head 'no'. He does it slow, somewhere between
timid and coquettish.

The boy watches Eric. Eric watches him right back.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Has anyone else seen it?

BOY
I don't know.

ERIC
Who would know?

BOY
Maybe grandma.

Eric's growing impatient with the half-answers and general
weirdness.

ERIC
Where's grandma?

BOY
She's upstairs. She sees everything up
there.

The boy continues staring at Eric. Eric looks away, around the bar.

He spots the stairs and heads for them. He looks back at the boy
behind the bar. The boy is still watching him.

CONTINUED: (2)

As he heads for the stairs, he sees the midget playing backgammon
against the two Chinese teenagers.

Eric climbs the stairs. They're dark. As he nears the top landing he
hear the muffled sounds of multiple couples fucking. It's a sickly
sound. Unnatural. Pained.

At the top of the stairs, Eric sees the upstairs area consists of
one long dark musty hall with doors on either side. Most doors are
shut. Hot light slivers in from the ones that are open.

At the end of the hall, a woman, GRANDMA, sits knitting in an
armchair, under a window. The click of her needles chimes
rhythmically down the hall as Eric approaches.

She doesn't look up at him.

ERIC
I'm looking for my car. It's a black Falcon
with three men in it. Did it come through
here?

The woman only glances up before returning to the click of her
knitting needles.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Have you seen it?

She addresses Eric like she would a little kid lost in a shopping
mall.

GRANDMA
What's your name?

ERIC
Have you seen it?

GRANDMA
What's your name, baby?

ERIC
Have you seen it?

The woman looks up at Eric.
GRANDMA,
Do you want to sleep with a boy? There's a
boy downstairs you can sleep with.
She turns her arm to show Eric the soft white skin on the inside of

her forearm which she strokes with her finger. It's not a delicate
stroke. It's perfunctory and cold.

(CONTINUED )

 

 
23.
CONTINUED: (3)

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
He's smooth like this part of your arm.

ERIC
I need to buy a gun.

GRANDMA
You carry yourself like a man who already
has a gun.

ERIC
You're carrying yourself like you know I
don't have one.

The woman examines him a moment. Her needles continue their gentle
click.

GRANDMA
You have one, you don't have one, makes no
difference to me, sweetheart. I don't know
anything about guns.

She turns her attention back out the window, conversation for her is
finished.

Eric takes the awkward cue to head back to the stairs. As he climbs
down them to the public bar of the hotel, he can hear the strange
squealing giggle of the lithe Chinese acrobats.

He heads to the boy behind the bar.

ERIC
Do you know where I can buy myself a gun?

GRANDMA
I think the midget with the Chinaboys there
has things. They sells things.

He moves straight over to the table where the acrobats play
backgammon with the tattooed midget.

The boys share a chair, sitting squashed together. One whispers
conspiratorially in the other's ear.

It's the midget's turn. He rolls the dice. The acrobat whispers in
his brother's ear.

MIDGET
(yells at whispering acrobat)
Stop it!

The acrobats smile,

Eric leans over the midget's shoulder and speaks soft, but firm.

ERIC
I need to speak to you.

The acrobat whispers again in his brother's ear.

MIDGET
(to acrobat)
If you don't fuckin cut it out now, I will
kill you. You hear me right? I'm gonna cut
your face off and I'm gonna eat it.

ERIC
I need a gun.
MIDGET
(to Eric)

Can you not hover around me?

The midget turns his attention back to the board. There is a
moment's silence. He lines up his move.

The Chinese acrobat whispers again in his brother's ear. The midget
shoves the board away from him on the table. The acrobats giggle and
squeal.

MIDGET (CONT'D)
That's it. I'm finished, You've fucked it.
You can't keep your tongues out of each
other's ears. I'm finished, Fuck you.

The midget hops off his chair. He grabs Eric by the hand and drags
him towards the back door.

EXT. HANGING GARDEN HOTEL / REAR ~ DAY

The midget leads Eric out the back door of the hotel. The rear area
is full of broken stuff and dog shit.

Two angry dogs holler and choke themselves on their chains. The
midget picks up a rock and pelts it at them.

The dogs bark more. The midget pelts another rock, Eric watches
this.

Eric and the midget cross this yard and through a wire gate to the
dry nothingness behind the hotel where a collection of busted
trucks and caravans are parked. ‘Jacobson Brothers Circus' is
stencilled on the sides of some with Chinese-character translation
underneath.

The midget sweats and mumbles to himself, barely intelligible spew.

(CONTINUED )

 

 
25.
CONTINUED:

MIDGET
(to the air in front of him)
It's so fuckin hot. It's so fuckin hot.

The midget muffles his last words, covering his nose and mouth with
his free hand. Eric is suddenly overcome by the stench too. He sees
a dead cow lying bloated on its side about 20 feet away.

The midget leads Eric winding between trucks to a little caravan at
the far rear of the parked convoy. The midget has to practically
climb the steps like a ladder to its little door and reach high over
his head for its handle.

He swings the door open. Eric follows him inside.
INT. MIDGET'S CARAVAN - DAY

The midget shuts the caravan door behind Eric and speaks directly to
him for the first time.

MIDGET
You make sure you got a grip on a person's
company before you start talking his
business in front of them.

The midget climbs up on his bed to be standing on it, about to reach
up to a shelf above it.

ERIC
I need a gun.

The midget turns back to Eric.

MIDGET
I just said an important thing about how to
behave in front of people. Don't you go
just ignoring me with what it is you want.

ERIC
I don't want it. I need it.

MIDGET
What does it look like I'm doing up here? I
heard you. I heard what you need. Pay me
the courtesy of blinking or some such so I
know you heard me, Do like this.

The midget blinks big and exaggerated.

ERIC
I heard you.

(CONTINUED)

 
26.
CONTINUED:

MIDGET
Puck.

The midget turns back to the shelf and carefully pulls down a box.
He lays it down on the bed. He stands over it and lifts its lid off.
Inside are four handguns, resting on folded towels.

Eric looks at them and reaches in for one.

MIDGET (CONT'D)
Careful.

Standing on the bed, the midget stands almost eye to eye with Eric.

MIDGET (CONT'D)
They're three hundred each.

Eric feels the gun's weight. He examines it, obviously familiar with
its operation, The midget points to each gun in the box
individually.

MIDGET (CONT'D)
That one's three hundred. That one's three
hundred. That one's three hundred... I only
take US dollars,

Eric puts the gun back in the box and lifts out another. He feels
its weight.

ERIC
I don't have three hundred US.

MIDGET
They‘re three hundred US.

ERIC
Can you do this one for less?

MIDGET
(irritated)
I told you how much they cost. They're
three hundred. You don't have three
hundred, then that's that. We can finish
talking.

Eric looks again at the gun in his hand.

Then, cold and blank, he raises it and SHOOTS the midget square in
the forehead. The midget falls back against the blood-splattered
caravan wall.

Eric shoves the gun down the front of his pants, looking around,
wary of the noise he has just made.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
27.
CONTINUED: (2)

He exits the caravan.
EXT. HANGING GARDEN HOTEL / REAR ~ DAY

Eric steps off the caravan steps, pulling the door closed behind
him.

He winds his way back towards the hotel ~- between the trucks, past
the dead cow, through the wire gate, past the angry dogs to the
hotel's back door.

INT. HANGING GARDEN HOTEL - DAY

Eric walks back through the hotel straight for the stairs. He climbs
them.

At the top, the woman is still sitting and knitting.

Eric moves straight to her. When he's standing over her, he pulls
the gun from his belt and points it at her face.

She looks up.

ERIC
I'm looking for a black Falcon. Have you
seen it?

The woman looks at him a long moment. She doesn't seem even remotely
unsettled. She looks at him gently. She continues knitting. Her
needles continue their click-click.

GRANDMA
What's your name? I want to know your name.
ERIC
Answer my question.
GRANDMA
Answer mine.
ERIC
Answer my question, I'm not gonna say it
again,
GRANDMA

OK, I'11 call you 'my baby'. My baby. I saw
a Falcon and it had three men in it and it
did what most cars do. It came in one
direction and left in the other. I can't
tell you any more than that. The only
detail I can give you is the detail that
pertains to this place. I can tell you what
they drank.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
I can tell you what they smelled like. I
can tell you how long they stayed. I can
tell you what they said, if they said
anything and if I heard what it is they
said. But that's about all I can tell you.

ERIC
What did they say?

She pauses, matches his stare. Her eyes are gentle,
GRANDMA
They didn't say anything. They didn't stop
here.

She holds Eric's eyes, as if the gun he holds is invisible. Eric
struggles inside.

The woman speaks tender. Eric stands catatonic, gun pointed.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
You must really love that car, darling.

She holds out her knitting for her own inspection. It's a tiny baby-
sized striped sweater. Eric holds the gun on her. He's lost.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
of all the things in this day and age to
get worked up about.

She looks him in the eye again.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
What is it about that car you love so much?

Eric doesn't answer. There's something about this woman he finds
intimidating, hypnotic.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Can you tell me?

Eric watches her, unmoving. She softens further.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
What's your name, sweetheart?

Eric takes a step closer, holding the gun on her, its barrel only
inches from her face.

She casually, slowly palms it away.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Don't be silly. Now you're just being
rude.

Eric slips the gun into his belt. He turns and heads back down the
hall towards the stairs.

He walks down the stairs.

He walks back through the public bar to the front door, oblivious to
the people watching him leave.

EXT. CARNY TOWN STREET - DAY

Eric steps back out onto the blinding street and makes the walk back
to the gas station and his car.

EXT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION - DAY

Eric arrives back at his busted car. The cop car is still there,
door still open.

Eric pulls his keys from his pocket. He drops them. He bends to pick
them up.

CLICK. A gun is cocked at his head.

Reynolds stands bloody and hunched behind him. He's in pain and
practically delirious.

REYNOLDS
What are you doing with this car?

ERIC
Why do you want to know?

REYNOLDS
My brother was in this car. Where is he?

ERIC
Who's your brother?

REYNOLDS
Where is he? Where's my brother?

Reynolds stumbles. Eric can see him fading.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
Where is he?

Reynolds stumbles to one knee.

In a flash, Eric pulls his own gun from his belt and holds it hard
against Reynolds' head,

Reynolds drops his gun. Eric speaks angry.

ERIC
Who's your brother? Where is he?

Reynolds coughs. He struggles for breath.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Where's your brother!?

REYNOLDS
I lost him.

ERIC
Where's he gone?

 

Reynolds struggles for breath.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Where's he gone? Tell me or I kill you now.

REYNOLDS

I need help.
ERIC

Tell me where he's gone.
REYNOLDS.

I know where he's gone.
ERIC

Where! ?

Reynolds spits.

REYNOLDS

But you gotta help me.
Reynolds spits again.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
I ain't good,

INT. CARNY TOWN / GAS STATION ~ DAY

Eric bursts into the store holding his gun. He heads around the
shelves to the counter.

Rounding the corner to the counter, a BLAST rips from the old guy's
shotgun, smashing shelves, blowing shit everywhere.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED;
Eric recoils behind the shelves.

ERIC
I need a doctor.

OLD GUY
Put your gun on the ground where I can
see it.

Eric puts the gun on the floor in the aisle.

OLD GUY (CONT‘D)
Now come out here where I can see you.

Eric emerges from the behind the shelves.
The old man is there, shotgun pointed straight at him.

Eric stands unafraid before the old guy.

ERIC
I need a doctor. Is there a doctor around
here?

OLD GUY
No.

ERIC

I need to find a doctor.

OLD GUY
There's no one useful here. I'm about
the most useful person in this town - if
that gives you any idea how far from
having a doctor this town is.

ERIC
Is there a doctor somewhere else? Somewhere
out of town?

OLD GUY
Why should I tell you?

ERIC
Help me, old man.

OLD GUY
I've been helping you, gon. That's all I've
been doing.

The old guy watches Eric. Eric watches him back.

ERIC
Please.

OLD GUY
Buy something.

ERIC
Please, old man.

OLD GUY
You buy something. I told you what I
got. I got sandwiches and cold drinks
and other stuff. I'm not doing this
because I love it. I'm doing this
because I need to make a living somehow.
And you come in here like I'm the
information kiosk. I'm a businessman
trying to run a business and instead I
gotta deal with this shit all day. You
go to that counter there and you pick
yourself out a sandwich or a cold drink
or maybe both and then I'll treat you
like a customer.

 

ERIC
I need a doctor.

 

OLD GUY
I'm not joking. I know you think I am,
but I'm not joking. You've walked in
here and our emotional lives have
intersected and this is where I'm at in
mine. And I won't accept that where
you're at in yours takes precedence. And
I've got a bigger gun than you, so
that's all that matters anyway. Pick
something off the shelf.

Eric and the old guy watch each other a moment before Eric steps
over to the drinks shelf and lifts a bottle off without looking at
it.

He then takes it to the counter warily. The old guy keeps his gun
trained as Eric reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small wad
of money.

ERIC
You take Australian dollars?

OLD GUY

I'd prefer not, but if that's what
you've got, then that's what I'll take.

(CONTINUED )

 
33.

Eric peels a ten-dollar note from the wad and places it on the
counter. The old guy reaches carefully into his pocket with his
free hand and produces a single two-dollar coin, which he slides
over to Eric.

OLD GUY (CONT'D)
There's a doctor in the hills. You head
east and you'll see the hills. Take the
first road you see that looks like it heads
for those hills and head for them and
eventually you'll see it. It's got an old
letterbox, says ‘Peeples’ on it. It's a
yellow letterbox, says 'Peeples' written on
it.

Eric nods a small thanks.

He picks his gun from the debris on the floor as he heads for the
door.

INT. COMMODORE ~- DAY
Eric drives, steady but urgent.

He looks over to Reynolds who is quietly clutching his guts, lost in
his own private pain.

REYNOLDS
What's going on?

ERIC
Tell me where your brother is.

REYNOLDS
You gotta get me to help.

ERIC
Tell me where he is. There's a good chance
you're gonna die soon so tell me now.

REYNOLDS
I can't do that.

Reynolds winces.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
Just help me, please.

INT. COMMODORE ~ NIGHT

It's dark now. Eric steers the car slowly along a winding road
heading up into the hills.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
34.
CONTINUED:

There's dense bush on either side of the road. The Commodore has
only one functioning headlight.

Eric keeps a sharp eye on the roadside, looking for the yellow
mailbox.

Reynolds is still beside him, now wrapped in a jacket. His eyes are
closed, but he's shivering. The temperature has dropped.

Nocturnal animal hoots and squeals can be heard eerily through the
car's busted windows.

Eric rounds a bend and there in the distance, by the side of the
road, is a yellow mailbox, illuminated in the weak beam of the
Commodore's light.

As the car nears, Eric strains to read 'PEEPLES' written on its
side.

He swings the wheel and takes the Commodore up the dirt drive beside
the mailbox.

The drive is long and narrow and boxed in either side by dense bush.
Eric is forced to take it slower than he'd like, driving with only
one headlight.

After something close to a kilometre, the drive opens out to a
clearing at the back of which, two hundred metres away, sits an old
wooden house on tropical stilts, surrounded by patches of lush
jungle. Behind the house is more dense bush.

Eric pulls the Commodore up close te the house and switches off the
engine.

He opens the door for a little overhead light and shoves his pistol
down the front of his pants.

He climbs out of the car.
EXT. PEEPLES HOUSE - NIGHT

Eric stands beside the Commodore and pulls his T-shirt down firmly
ever his belt, properly concealing his pistol.

He walks away from the car, leaving the door open. In the light in
the car, we can see Reynolds curled up in the jacket.

Eric walks warily towards the house, looking around him, closely
inspecting the house as he approaches.

When he is only metres from the front steps, a security light
switches on automatically.

35.
CONTINUED:

Eric stops dead in his tracks. He pauses a second, then continues on
carefully.

He climbs the wooden steps to the house's front door. Old Tibetan
prayer flags hang all along the front porch.

He looks around, then opens the fly screen and bangs loudly on the
door.

He lets the fly screen close again and adjusts the gun in his belt.
He looks back to the car, at Reynolds inside it.

He opens the fly screen and bangs again. He lets the fly screen
close.

A FEMALE VOICE.
boc

Pull the gun out of your pants and put it

on the ground,
Eric turns.
A girl, DOC, maybe only 17 years old, is standing down the other end
of the porch pointing a rifle at him. She's wearing shorts and a T-
shirt. No shoes. She's been asleep.

Eric notices an older Aboriginal man, MICKEY, standing down off the
porch beside him.

Eric pulls the pistol from his belt and carefully puts it down on
the porch,

ERIC
This man needs help.

DOC
Kick the gun over here.

Eric kicks the gun. It skids across the porch landing close to the
girl's feet.

DOC (CONT'D)
Lift your shirt and turn slow.

Eric lifts his shirt, turns slow.

Eric bends and rolls his shorts, first one leg, then the other,
exposing his thighs.

DOC (CONT'D)
Now bend slow and take your shoes off,

Eric slips his sneakers off and drops them beside him.

poc (CONT’D)
Now your socks.

Eric peels his socks off, then stands straight.

ERIC
He needs help.

DOC
OK.

With her eyes trained on Eric's, she kicks his handgun back along
the porch. It slides to a rest against his feet.

She looks at him a moment longer.

Mickey, can you help him get the guy
inside?

INT. PEEPLES HOUSE / SURGERY ~ NIGHT

A small Buddhist shrine. Framed pictures of various Geshes and one
of a young Tibetan boy in robes ~ the new Dalai Lama.

Surgical equipment. Anatomical diagrams and charts on the walls.
Animals and people.

Reynolds is laid out on a big wooden dining table in a back room
clearly not used for dining.

Dec is fishing around inside Reynolds' gut with surgical tools.

Eric sits slouched in a chair against a wall. He's exhausted and
unsettled.

Mickey sits in a chair in the corner of the room, keeping watch,
the rifle across his lap.

ERIC
You're a Buddhist.

DOC
I'm not a Buddhist. I just like
Buddhism.

ERIC
That makes you a Buddhist.

Doc
Just because I like something doesn't
mean I am that thing.

 

ERIC
That's exactly what it means. What's a
Buddhist doing pointing a gun at me?

She looks at him. He's suddenly more interesting than she'd first
thought.

DOC
Nothing says I can't defend myself when I
need to.

ERIC

What makes you think you don't still
need to? Why did you give me my gun
back?

She ignores this for a moment, concentrating on the mess before
her.

DOC
I just needed to get a look in your eyes,
get a look at your character.

 

Eric is forced to think momentarily about his 'character'. His eyes
don't leave Doc.

You think you can know who I am by looking
in my eyes?

She wipes her nose with the back of her sleeve.

It looks like the bullet went straight
through him, But he's lost some blood, I
reckon.

Eric doesn’t respond. He looks at Mickey who is looking right back
at him and has been all along.

Silence.

DOC (CONT'D)
Is this man your friend?

ERIC
I met him in the street.

ERIC (CONT'D)
How much do you want for this?

Doc
I don't want your money. Money's not
what I think about when I can see
someone's in a bad way.

She concentrates a moment.

DOC (CONT'D)
I've gotten pretty good at learning
how to live without money.

ERIC
How do you know how to do this?

Doc
I know how to do a lot of things. I've
taught myself how to do a lot of
different things.

Eric watches her.

He stands.

She watches him.

He leaves the room. She and Mickey watch him go.

INT, PEEPLES HOUSE / BATHROOM ~- NIGHT

Eric lifts his shirt off, standing in the bathroom beside a big tub
of water. He takes a towel from the wall rack and dips it in the
tub.

He is covered in road filth from the Commodore's missing windshield.

He soaks the towel in the tub and rubs it deep over his face. He
then methodically sponges his torso.

He winces in pain. He has accrued cuts and bruises he hadn't noticed
until now.

He wrings the soaking towel in the bathroom sink and drops it on the
floor.

He takes another towel and dries himself.
He stops and takes a moment to look at himself in the mirror.
INT. PEEPLES HOUSE / LOUNGE - NIGHT

Eric emerges from the bathroom and walks the hall to the lounge.
While Doc works on Reynolds, Eric roams her house. The lounge is
relaxed. Dark. Old Asian furniture.

INT. PEEPLES HOUSE / BACK ROOM ~- NIGHT

Eric wanders into a dark room and flicks on the fluorescent light.
The room is stacked floor to ceiling with cages. Dogs in the cages.
Different breeds. They don’t make sound. Where normal dogs would go
crazy barking with the arrival of a stranger, these dogs sit silent,
shut down.

Eric noticeably shifts, softens in their presence. He sits ina
chair. He scans the cages. His eyes begin to well.

He drops his face into his hands.

boc
I have to keep them locked up in here for
the most part coz there's people out there
who'll take them for food. There's hungry
people around here. Have you got a
television?

Eric turns, startled. Doc stands in the doorway. She has blood down
the front of her apron.

He turns back to face the dogs, to hide his face from Doc. Emotion
doesn't sit comfortably.

ERIC
No.

DOC
I figure if I had a TV I'd know why these
guys have come to me... I've stopped paying
attention. I hear things. People have
things to say about the world. But I don't
feel like anybody has any idea what they're
talking about.

She seems strangely resigned to some fate she can't foresee. She
seems strangely accepting of the hardened man crying quietly in

front of her. She stands in the doorway looking at the cages and
their occupants.

DOC (CONT'D)
Nearly all of these guys have come to me in
the last twelve months. People bring them
and ask me to look after them while they go
away - because they have to go somewhere or
do something. And then none of them have
ever come back... I guess they've gone
looking for money. That's the only reason
people move around. Money and love. But I
don't suppose all these guys have come to
me because their owners have gone looking
for love.

She scratches her nose with her arm, her hands still wet from a post-

op scrub.

Eric makes

Doc {CONT'D)

weren't coming back, even if they didn't
know it properly themselves yet.

INT, PEEPLES HOUSE / LOUNGE - NIGHT
Doc and Eric stand in the lounge, looking at the lounge setting.
DOC
You might be too long for the couch, I
dunno, All these chairs are comfy.

They stand in the room in awkward silence for a moment, like maybe
something else needs to be said.

Doc starts towards the hall.

ERIC
Why have you done this for him?

She stops.

EXT. PEEPLES HOUSE DAY
Early morning. The sun has risen above the hills behind the house.
Cockatoos screech.
INT. PEEPLES HOUSE / LOUNGE - DAY
Eric is asleep in an armchair, wrapped in a too-small blanket.
Sun filters into the room. It feels dark and cool in the house.

Eric opens his eyes. Reynolds is standing before him, looking at
him, clutching his side, wobbly on his feet.

OK,

REYNOLDS

Who doctored me?

Eric stands and looks around. He crosses the room to doors opening
onto a back veranda. The doors are open. He steps outside.

EXT. PEEPLES HOUSE - DAY

The day outside is already bleached and hot. Eric goes to the
veranda railing and looks out over paddocks to the densely bushed
hills and valleys beyond.

Doc is at the nearest back fence, feeding a horse from a bucket,
talking to Mickey.

Eric watches her. She strokes the horse's head, then leaves the
bucket and heads back to the house.

As she approaches, she looks up to see Eric watching her.
INT. PEEPLES HOUSE / LOUNGE ~ DAY

Reynolds sits shirtless in a chair by the dining table while Doc
inspects his bandages.

Eric stands nearby, looking out the window.
boc
(to Reynolds)
Lift your arm for me. Can you lift it?
Reynolds lifts his arm, wincing only slightly with pain.
DOC (CONT'D)
That looks OK. You'll need to keep it
clean.

REYNOLDS
OK.

(CONTINUED )

 
43.
CONTINUED:

Doc stands.

boc
I can give you some fresh swabs and
bandages.

REYNOLDS

Thank you, mam.
Doc smiles and leaves the room.

ERIC
We need to get going.

REYNOLDS
We should ask the lady.

ERIC
We're leaving.

REYNOLDS
We should ask what the lady says.

A CHIME sounds. It's like an electric doorbell. Eric and Reynolds
freeze, looking at each other, suddenly anxious.

Eric moves quickly to a window to see what he can see outside.

Doc enters, holding swabs and bandages. She looks concerned.

ERIC
What's that sound mean?
boc
A car's coming up the drive.
ERIC
What car?
DOC

I don't know.
The sound CHIMES again.

Doc (CONT'D)
That's two cars.

ERIC
Who knows we're up here?

Doc /
I haven't told anyone. i

(CONTINUED )

 
44,
CONTINUED: (2)

Beat,

ERIC
We need to leave.

Eric hurriedly starts grabbing his things - jacket, shoes, gun.
DOC
There's no way out of here other than the

way they're coming in.

ERIC
How long have we got?

Doc helps Reynolds put his T-shirt back on,

boc
A minute maybe. I should go talk to them.

ERIC
If it's who I think it is, they won't be
here to talk.

boc
Who is it?

Eric checks the mag of his handgun.
DOC (CONT'D)
(more frantic)
Who is it?

ERIC
Circus freaks. Where's your rifle?

DOC
Why? Tell me what's going on here.

Eric turns to her directly, sternly.

boc (CONT’D)
Get your rifle.

Doc leaves the room.
ERIC
(to Reynolds)
Where's your gun?
REYNOLDS

I don't know. In the car, I'd be
guessing,

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
45,
CONTINUED: (3)

Eric moves to the window.
Reynolds tries to lift himself off his chair, struggles.

REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
You want I should go get it?

Eric peers through the window to the still empty drive.

ERIC
No.

Through the window, Eric can see the first of the cars appear,
heading up the drive. It's a white Hi-Ace minivan with two people
inside, the Chinese acrobats.

It's followed soon after by a small white utility truck with lone
driver.

And then Eric sees Mickey heading across the front grounds to
greet the new arrivals.

Doc appears behind him with the rifle.

BOC
Tell me what's going on here.

Eric reaches for the rifle. She passes it to him.
He checks it. He handles it expertly.

Doc moves to the window and looks out to see the vehicles coming
to a stop.

And Mickey approaching to meet them.
boc (CONT'D)
Oh God.
(to Eric)
What's going on here?
Eric takes her by the arm and pulls her away.

ERIC
Move away from the window.

Doc stumbles back into the centre of the room, shaken and
confused.

Eric rests the rifle on the sill.

DOC
Who are these people?

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

 
46.
CONTINUED: (4)

Before he can line up a shot, Mickey approaches the window of the
now stationary van.

He leans in to the driver's window to talk. Two words are
exchanged,

And then Mickey is SHOT in the head at close range, slumping to
the ground beside the van.

DOC (CONT‘D)
No.

The DOGS in cages start HOWLING from the back room.
boc (CONT’D)
(distraught)
What's going on?!
Eric pulls the rifle trigger.

The single crack opens a spider web in the van's windscreen.

The rifle blast inside the room is loud. Reynolds covers his
ears, frightened and confused.

Doc is now frantic, paralysed.

boc (CONT’D)
What's going on?!
Quickly, expertly, Eric shifts his position slightly on the window
sill. He fires again. Opens another jagged web on the passenger
side of the windscreen.

The man in the utility is now out of his truck, confused,
brandishing a handgun.

Eric shifts slightly again and fires.

The man drops.

Silence, bar one howling dog.

Eric breathes, waits for sign of movement.
None.

And then Doc charges across the room and attacks him. She jumps on
his back, wailing and scratching.

Eric lifts her off the ground with one arm, the other still

clutching the rifle. He carries her across the room and puts her
down against the wall.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
47.
CONTINUED: (5)

She crumples and cries.

Eric breathes, gathers his thoughts.

He props the rifle against the wall.

ERIC

Call the police, They'll deal with the
bodies. Tell them whatever you need to
tell them. Square your ledger. They
won't bother with me, but it'll make
you feel better.

Doc sits, wrecked, breathing shallow, looking at him with broken
contempt.

ERIC (CONT'D)
I didn't mean for this happen. It just
followed me here.

DOC
That's you.

He looks at her. He knows he has ruined this place.

DOC (CONT’D)
What follows you is what you are.

He doesn't know how to respond to this.

Reynolds is still sitting with his hands over his ears. Eric looks
at him coldly.

ERIC
Get up.

EXT. PEEPLES HOUSE - DAY
Eric and Reynolds in the Commodore.

The now serene and menacing hills loom behind them as Eric takes the
car back out onto the sealed road.

 

INT. COMMODORE - DAY

It's dusk. The sun barely clings to the horizon. Eric looks weary
behind his sunglasses. He's pressing on. They’re back in dry
country.

The wind tears through the broken passenger window.

(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
Reynolds is asleep. The temperature has dropped. Reynolds has
wrapped his arms in a plastic bag to keep warm. It rustles wildly
and loudly in the gust.

Eric drops the Commodore down a gear, slowing behind a big, dirty
truck on the outskirts of a dry and dirty town.

Reynolds wakes, dopey. He pulls the cacophonous plastic bag away and
throws it into the back seat.

REYNOLDS
Where are we?

ERIC
I don't know.

They sit in silence.

REYNOLDS
I'm hungry.

Eric stays unreachable behind his sunglasses, following the truck
into town.

Reynolds looks out the window at an emaciated dog snouting the
remains of a dead animal in the road.

EXT. MOTEL ~ NIGHT
The sun has just dropped, but the sky hums vaguely purple.

Eric cruises the Commodore past an old motel on a back street of the
town.

I/E. COMMODORE ~ NIGHT

Eric scopes the motel as they pass.

He pulls into the motel car park. He takes the Commodore down past
the last room and swings it around the back, out of sight from the
street, and comes to a stop.

He shoves his pistol down the front of his pants and pulls the key
from the ignition.

ERIC
Wait here.

Eric gets out of the car and heads back around the front of the
motel to the reception office. He looks around cautiously as he
walks.

Reynolds watches him from inside the car.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
49,

INT. MOTEL / RECEPTION OFFICE - NIGHT
Eric enters the motel reception.
It's empty.

And then a little Aboriginal kid enters from a back room. He eyes
Eric suspiciously.

The room is dank and dimly lit with a low-watt fluorescent tube.

ERIC
I need a room.

KID
OK,

The kid runs off behind the counter and through a door leading into
a dark hall.

Eric looks around. The only sign of decoration is a big old map of
Australia stuck to the wall, yellowed and frayed. Eric studies it
from where he stands. He looks at it close - east coast cities,
desert, tropical north. Everything on the map seems so far away,
from another time.

The kid re-enters the reception area. Eric turns from the map.

KID (CONT'D)
You gotta pay me.

ERIC
How much?

KID
USA eighty for one night.

ERIC
You take Australian?

KID
USA money.

Eric looks at the kid, contemplates arguing the price and currency,
decides against.

He pulls his depleted roll from his pocket and peels off 80. He puts
it on the counter.

The kid hands him a fat room key.

(CONTINUED )

 

 
50.
CONTINUED:
KID (CONT'D)
You got number seven. There's sheets and
that in there.

ERIC
Where are we here?

Eric stuffs his money roll back in his pocket.

KID
Queen's Motel.

ERIC
What town are we in?

KID
We're in Belindem.

ERIC
Where is it? Show me on the map.

Eric points to the map on the wall. The kid clambers up on an
armchair underneath it.

KID
It's not written on this here, but
it's somewhere like this place.

He points with a little grubby finger to a spot somewhere in the
vast eastern half of the map.

Eric takes a look where the kid points.
He lifts the kid down from the armchair and heads for the door.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The door unlocks. Eric opens it and holds it open. Reynolds enters
the room.

Eric stands at the door, scouring the street outside.

Reynolds lowers himself onto one of the two single beds in the room,
wincing slightly with pain, as Eric closes the door and latches it.

ERIC
You're gonna start talking to me.

REYNOLDS
What?

(CONTINUED)

 

 
51.

CONTINUED:
ERIC
Don't fuckin 'what' me. You're gonna talk.
Now.
REYNOLDS

But I told you I can't tell you nothing
more than I already told you.

ERIC
I don't care what you think you already
told me. You're gonna talk. And you're
gonna do it now.

REYNOLDS
But I can't.

Eric steps fast across the room.

He heaves Reynolds off the bed and slams him against the wall,
holding him by his shirt and throat.

ERIC
Where are we?

Reynolds' face contorts in pain.

REYNOLDS
Don't.

ERIC
Where are we?

REYNOLDS
What?

ERIC

Where are we?

REYNOLDS
I don't know.

ERIC
I don't know either. So how are we gonna
find out how to get to where we're going if
you don't know where you are and I don't
know where where we're going is?

Eric holds Reynolds against the wall.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Can you answer that?

(CONTINUED )

 

 

 
52.
CONTINUED: (2)

Reynolds doesn't answer but the look of fear and confusion on his
face is clear,

ERIC (CONT'D)
Do you even understand what I just said,
half-wit?

Eric stares hard and close into Reynolds' eyes.

ERIC (CONT'D)
No. You don't.

Eric releases him. Reynolds crumples to the ground, holding his
side. Eric stands over him, watching.

ERIC (CONT'D)
I need to eat. Then we're sleeping a few
hours and we're going again. And somewhere
between now and then, you're gonna start
talking to me or I'm gonna slit your
throat. Do you understand that?

Reynolds stares at the floor. Eric kicks his feet.

ERIC (CONT’D)
I asked you a fuckin question.

Reynolds nods, still staring at the floor.

REYNOLDS
Yes.

Eric leaves the room.

I/E. EAT-HOUSE = NIGHT

A grey, empty and fluorescent-lit shopfront eat-house behind a three~
quarter-open roller door. Six plastic tables with short plastic
seats.

The street outside is quiet, shut down for the night.

Eric stands at the counter, spooning rice and a dried~fish paste
onto a plate from big bowls of same.

It's food that has been cooked on a dirty grill made of loose
bricks and hot coals beside the counter.

When the bowl is full Eric pulls cash from his pocket and sits it on
the counter, making cold and fleeting eye-contact with a young
Chinese woman sitting on a short stool behind it. The woman seems
interested in nothing but the cards she has laid out on the floor at
her feet in Solitaire formation.

(CONTINUED }

 

 
53.
CONTINUED:

Eric steps away from the counter and takes a seat right beside
Reynolds who is already well into his plate.

Eric mixes his rice and fish around with his spoon and takes a
mouthful. He chews a moment before reaching into his mouth and
removing a bone. He puts the bone into a faded plastic Coca-Cola
ashtray.

They sit in silence.

Then Reynolds gets out of his seat and goes to the counter. Eric
only glances up at him as he goes.

Eric eats alone, staring out into the dark and quiet street.

He hears voices behind him. He turns to see Reynolds in
conversation with the woman behind the counter. Reynolds is
speaking halting Chinese.

The conversation finishes. Reynolds returns to the table and
resumes his eating.

REYNOLDS
We're going to Carloon.

Eric looks at him sideways, suspicious.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
I just went over and asked that lady how
we'd go about getting to Carloon from here,

Pause. Eric says nothing.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
You said you wanted to know so bad,

Now that Reynolds is talking, Eric watches him, waiting for more to
unveil.

Eric takes another mouthful of rice.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)

And I might as well tell you coz what's to
stop you going over there now and asking
her the same question? Or not the same
question but a question about my question,
like a question about the question I just
asked her about how we'd go about getting
to Carloon and then you'd know anyway.

Beat. Eric watches Reynolds. Reynolds has been thinking about this.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
54,
CONTINUED: (2)
REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
But you don't know where in Carloon we're
going, so I'm still in control here.

Eric watches Reynolds coldly.

ERIC
Who are you?

REYNOLDS
I'm Rey.

ERIC

Who are you? Why are you here?

REYNOLDS
Me and my brother came out for the
mines. Like everybody else.

ERIC

Why's your brother in Carloon?
REYNOLDS

Coz that's where he was gonna go.
ERIC

Why are you here and your brother's in

Carloon?

Reynolds appears like he hasn't thought to ask himself this question
already. Or it's something he hasn't wanted to think about.

REYNOLDS
Coz he had to get going in a big hurry.

ERIC
Why was he in a big hurry?

REYNOLDS
Coz he had to get away from the police.

ERIC
Why did have to get away from the police?

Reynolds looks around the empty shop. Talking about his brother is
making him anxious.

REYNOLDS

I don't know. I can't talk no more about
it.

(CONTINUED )

 

 

 

 

 
55.
CONTINUED: (3)

ERIC
Why did he have to get away from the
police?

REYNOLDS

I can't talk about it no more.

ERIC
Whatever it was he did, you got left
behind to die while he was doing it.

Eric watches Reynolds. Reynolds can't meet his eyes.

REYNOLDS
It didn't happen like that.

ERIC
How did it happen then?

REYNOLDS
I said I can't talk to you no more about
it, so stop asking me about everything.

Reynolds turns his head even further away. Eric takes another
spoonful of food, almost bemused.

Reynolds is thinking. And it takes him a long moment of Eric
mouthfuls and Reynolds silence for him to work out what it is he
wants to say.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
I believe in God and I know Henry believes
in God and so there's no harm Henry would
want to see me come to. I believe in that,

Eric almost thinks this is funny.
ERIC

So take a look at the harm you've come to
and where's Henry?

REYNOLDS
He's waitin' for me.
ERIC
You believe that.
REYNOLDS
Yes.
ERIC

He's not waiting for you.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
56.
CONTINUED: (4)

REYNOLDS
Yes, he is.

Eric pauses, looks at Reynolds. Eric's face shifts to something
approaching contempt.

ERIC
He's not waiting for you.

Eric stares cold and empty at Reynolds.

ERIC (CONT’D)

You need to learn how to live. God's not
gonna teach you. Your mum and dad won't
teach you. Your brother's not gonna
teach you that. Just coz he and you came
out of the same woman's hole doesn't
mean anything. The only thing that means
anything is that I'm here with you now
and he's not.

(pause)
The sooner you learn that, the sooner you
learn what it is about people that makes
them tick — and that it's not you that
makes them tick - the sooner you learn that
about people, the better off you'll be. You
understand that? You need to learn how to
live... Otherwise you're gonna die real
soon,

Reynolds has his head bowed.
ERIC (CONT'D)
Your brother left you to rot. That's what
people do.
Reynolds offers no response. Eric watches intensely for one. Eric is
surprised at his own feelings - what began as dismissive contempt
here has started to boil.
Reynolds continues staring at his plate, giving nothing but defeat.
ERIC (CONT'D)
You don't realise that, your death is gonna
come to you real soon.

Eric stands. He's angry. He steps over the bench they sit on, throws
his spoon down on the table and exits.

Reynolds is left sitting in the dank eat-house, trying his best to
feign stoicism.

He sits in this position a while. Then he resumes eating alone.

 

 

 
57.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Eric lies on his bed, in jeans and no shirt, asleep.

Sun streams into the room through half~open venetians.

His eyes open, And then he sits up, startled.

Reynolds is curled asleep in the next bed, under the covers.

ERIC
Wake up.

Eric gets off the bed and pulls his T-shirt on.

ERIC (CONT'D)
C'mon. Get up. We gotta go.

Eric goes to the water bucket in the bathroom. It's practically
empty. He tips it over his face.

He re-enters the room. Reynolds stirs.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Get up.

Eric takes his gun from under his pillow and sticks it in the front
of his pants.

He moves to the end of Reynolds’ bed and pulls the covers away.
Reynolds is fully clothed and curled up.

ERIC (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get us some water. When I get
back you need to be ready to leave.
Reynolds rubs his eyes.

ERIC (CONT'D)
You hear me? We can't stay here.

Reynolds nods.
REYNOLDS
(meekly)
Yes,

Eric steps outside.

 

 

 

 

 
58.

EXT. MOTEL ~ DAY

Erie steps into the scorching daylight, squinting. He lets his eyes
adjust and then walks past other rooms that appear to be unoccupied -
no cars parked outside them, no sign of life.

Eric heads round behind the motel to where the Commodore is parked.

 

He reaches in the car's broken back window and pulls out two old and
empty plastic water bottles.

He looks around to see who might be watching, scouring the area. He
sees a water pump out the back of building a hundred yards across a
dusty and foul vacant lot.

He heads towards it.

I/E. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Reynolds sits up and drops his legs over the side of the bed. He
rubs his eyes. He looks sad.

He stands and goes to the window. He peers through the venetians out
to the street,

 

In the street, he sees a POLICE CAR pull up and stop in the street
outside the motel, across the car park.

Startled, Reynolds steps away from the window. He is suddenly
panicked.

He goes to the bathroom. A small half open window sits above the
sink. Reynolds contemplates it a moment then goes back into the
room, looking around anxious.

He goes to his dirty plastic bag on the floor and pulls a handgun
from inside it.

He then crouches between the beds, the gun pointed at the door.

A few tense and silent moments pass. And then there is a KNOCK at
the door.

Reynolds is frozen with fear. He waits,

Then another KNOCK.

 

Followed closely by another.

Reynolds squeezes his eyes shut and fires the gun at the door. It
BLASTS loud in the little room. A hole cracks through the thin wood
of the door. Reynolds can hear the sound of someone hitting the
cement outside.

(CONTINUED }
59.
CONTINUED:

He stands slowly, still clutching his gun, and creeps towards the
door.

He takes the handle and turns it gently.
The latch gives. Reynolds pulls the door open.

Lying outside, dead and gored, is the little Aboriginal motel boy
still clutching a stack of folded sheets.

Reynolds stands stunned and horrified looking at the mess he has
made until, with a BLAST, the door beside him practically EXPLODES
into splinters.

Reynolds hits the ground in the doorway and looks across the street.

The cop stands beside his car, across the motel car park, holding a
pump-action shotgun.

Reynolds scurries on his hands and knees back inside the motel room.
EXT. BUILDING - DAY

Eric stands, eyes wired, ears pricked. The hand pump beside him
trickles water over the upturned bottles.

He pulls the gun from his pants and makes his way cautiously towards
the sound.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Reynolds sits under the window, clutching his gun and breathing
hard,

Another BLAST and the window above him shatters and showers glass.
Reynolds is frantic. He pops up and looks through the window and
then pops straight back down again. He sees the cop fleetingly. He
lifts his handgun and points it blind out the window. He pulls the
trigger twice. Two REPORTS ring out.

Another shotgun BLAST takes a chunk out of the window frame.
Reynolds cowers.

EXT. MOTEL ~ DAY

Eric rounds the side of a building onto the road, a hundred yards
from the motel. He looks down the street to see the cop, in profile,
crouched beside his car, slotting shotgun cartridges into his pump-

action.

The cop raises the shotgun and blasts in the direction of the motel.

(CONTINUED)

 
60.
CONTINUED:

Eric crosses the footpath onto the street and begins a slow creep
towards the cop, concealing himself behind parked cars.

He has his gun drawn.

As he draws closer, the motel comes into proper view. He can see
that it is their room that has been shot up and that has now become
the site of a siege.

A handgun report pops from the motel room.

Eric creeps closer, approaching the cop from behind.

The cop raises his pump-action and fires again at the room.

Eric creeps closer.

The cop slides the chamber,

Eric steps up directly behind the cop now. He holds his gun at the
back of the cop's head, point blank, and pulls the trigger.

Blood sprays from the cop's face as he slumps forward and the
shotgun clatters to road at his side.

Eric stands over the body. He didn't want to have to do this. He
looks around. Three Aboriginal boys watch from a long way down the
street. Other than that, all is empty and quiet.

Eric steps over the cop's body and walks across the motel car park,
squinting in the sun,

It feels like a long walk. Halfway across the car park, another
handgun report cracks from the motel room.

Eric stops, half-~ducks.
ERIC
(yells)
It's me!
REYNOLDS (0,S.)
(yells)
Is it you?
ERIC
(yells)
Stop shooting!
Eric continues his walk, picking up the pace.

He reaches the door to the room.

 

 

 
61.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Eric opens the door.

Reynolds is cowered under the window, in a mess of broken glass and
splintered wood.

He is crying. He looks up at Eric like a scared and crazy little
kid.

REYNOLDS
(through sobs)
I just wanted to fight. I just wanted to
fight him.
Eric watches Reynolds for a moment. Then he looks around the room.

ERIC
We gotta go.

Eric starts gathering his things together. He pulls blankets off the
beds.

Reynolds watches him do it.
Eric drags him roughly up off the ground by his shirt.
ERIC (CONT'D)
(impatient)

Let's go. Get up.
EXT. MOTEL - DAY
Eric and Reynolds approach the Commodore - a distraught Reynolds a
couple of feet behind Eric, carrying his stuff in his dirty plastic
bag.

They wrench open the car's doors and climb inside.

Eric fires the engine and reverses hard back around the motel into
its car park.

He then slams into gear and drives out onto the street, leaving the
carnage behind in the heat.

I/E. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric rounds a corner, taking the Commodore onto the town's bright
and empty main street.

A hundred metres ahead, they see a little Aboriginal boy standing in
the street, waving them down.

(CONTINUED)

 
62.
CONTINUED:

Reynolds is anxious. Eric is impassive. They don't speak.

The kid continues waving as they approach and then points off to the
side.

Then the WAIL of a train's horn.

To the car's left is a long and dirty freight train approaching a
crossing in the street ahead of them. It's too close to outrun.

Eric slows the car to a stop as the train crosses the street before
them.

The train is old and rusted - a long line of heavy industrial
freight containers pulled by an old mean engine.

On the roof of every third container, guys in dirty civilian clothes
- T-shirts, jeans, track pants - sit cross-legged, clutching machine
guns like a low-paid militia guarding the train and its cargo. They
look down listlessly at the Commodore as the train rolls past.

The Aboriginal boy, now with two friends, stands beside the car at
Reynolds' window, his hand held out for money.

TRAIN BOY
{to Reynolds)
Money.

Reynolds looks to the kid,
Eric watches the train pass, watching the machine guns on its roof.
TRAIN BOY (CONT'D)
You gotta give me money for telling you
about the train's coming.

REYNOLDS
I ain't got no money.

The train is inconceivably long and moves slow. It feels to Eric and
Reynolds that they are sitting at this crossing for an uncomfortably
long time.

The Aboriginal boy keeps up his demands for money. He moves round
the front of the car to Eric's window.

TRAIN BOY
(to Eric)
You gotta give me money for telling you
about the train's coming.

Eric ignores him, watching the train.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
63.
CONTINUED: (2)

TRAIN BOY (CONT'D)
Friend. You gotta give me money.

Eric ignores the kid. He looks over his shoulder to survey the
street behind them, Nothing. Emptiness and heat haze. He turns back.

TRAIN BOY (CONT'D)
Give me money for telling you about the
train's coming.

The train's last carriages finally heave by.

With the little Aboriginal kid still wanting his money, Eric puts
the Commodore in gear and rolls it slowly across the tracks.

Eric picks up the speed, pulling away, leaving the kid and his
friends behind them in the heat and the nowhere.

EXT. DESERT ~ DAY

The Commodore growls over bitumen through the scrub plain. Lone
birds in the sky scour the ground for food, squawking something that
sounds like pain.

INT. COMMODORE - DAY

Hot. Dusty. Dry.

Wind races through the broken passenger window. Reynolds is
buffeted by it.

Eric watches the road from behind his shades.

He stays looking straight ahead, unreadable, as they head towards
the hills that loom heavy.

EXT. OPEN-CUT MINE ~ DAY

Eric stands on the rim of a long abandoned giant open~cut mine.
It's a gigantic tiered pit of scorched ground and devastation
hundreds of metres deep and stretching for miles, earth gouged and
raped and left for dead.

Eric stares across it to the horizon, expressionless behind his
sunglasses.

Reynolds heads back towards the car, zipping his fly and wiping
his hands on his shirt.

Eric continues his gaze a few moments longer then turns back to
the car,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
64.

EXT. FUEL STATION - DAY

The Commodore pulls into a roadside fuel station in a town of no
more than three buildings. Hardly a town at all - more a couple of
people huddled together for survival.

The station is two pumps and a concrete shack with barred and tinted
windows.

Eric pulls the Commodore up beside one of the pumps.
He gets out.
Eric heads for the shack.

He leans in to the slot in the heavily fortified main window. He can
barely see inside. It's dark and dirty.

ERIC
Hello?

VOICE
How much you want?

ERIC
Fifty.

VOICE
Fifty US?

ERIC

Fifty Australian.

VOICE
US dollars only.

ERIC
I'm out of US.

VOICE
Take it or leave it.

ERIC
What's wrong with Australian money?

Take it or leave it.

ERIC
It's paper. It's worthless.

Nothing's worth anything, mate, so
it's worth whatever I say it is.

Eric pulls a single US note from his pocket and slaps it up
against the filthy window for the voice to see.

ERIC
It's a piece of fuckin paper.

VOICE
Yeah, and a diamond's a piece of fuckin
rock. Take it or leave it.

Reynolds appears beside Eric at the window.
REYNOLDS
{through the window)
How much do you need?

VOICE
Fifty US.

Reynolds pulls a healthy roll from his pocket, peels a fifty and
slides it through the slot.

Eric watches him, surprised to see him with so much money, surprised
he'd assumed he'd have none.

REYNOLDS
(through slot)
Have you got any .38 in there?

VOICE
Maybe.

Reynolds slides another note through the slot.

REYNOLDS
I need a box.

Reynolds looks out at the desert, deliberately avoiding eye contact
with Eric.

An awkward moment passes before the goods tray rattles and slides
open. In it is a box of .38 ammunition and some change. Reynolds
slips the change in his pocket, grabs his box and walks back to the
car.

He gets in and shuts the door.

Eric walks to the pump. He unscrews the Commodore's fuel cap. It's
rusty and stuck. It takes some twisting to remove.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
66.
CONTINUED: (2)

He pulls the nozzle from the pump. This isn't regular petrol being
pumped. It's something else, Eric has to screw the nozzle's plastic
casing over the Commodore's fuel hole ~ like a garden hose over a
tap.

The gas starts filling with a hissing sound.

Eric peers inside the car. Reynolds is in the passenger seat loading
+38 into his handgun.

EXT. CAMPSITE + EVENING
Sunset. Peach and purple sky.
Eric sits, poking a new fire with a stick.

Reynolds sits by the fire. He picks his nose and flicks the snot
into the scrub.

REYNOLDS
She said in the old days it would take
us about eight hours to get there, but
it might take longer now coz a bunch of
those old roads ain't there no more or
at least they're all bad now so you
can't drive fast on ‘em.

Eric stares at the fire.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
She said about eight hours. She said
about eight to nine hours in the old
days. She wasn't sure if it was eight or
nine. She seemed a bit confused about
it. And the roads are all bad now
anyway.

ERIC
Why would he still be there?

REYNOLDS
He has to wait two weeks for someone.
There's a man he's meeting there and
it's gonna take two weeks.

ERIC
You know this? Or this is what he told
you?

REYNOLDS
Huh?

(CONTINUED)

 

 
67.
CONTINUED:
ERIC
You should be clear now your brother
isn't someone you can trust.
Reynolds doesn't respond. Eric has re~kindled in him the pain he
felt the night before. Reynolds sits in silence, staring into the
fire.
ERIC (CONT'D)
So is it something you know or is it
just something he said?
Pause. Reynolds in an attempt at defiance ~

REYNOLDS
It's both those things.

Eric rips the lid from a small tin of food on the dirt beside him.
He spoons its contents into his mouth with the blade from a pocket
knife.

REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
You work in the mines?

Pause.

ERIC
No.

REYNOLDS
What do you do then?

Eric looks at him, contemplating whether he wants to engage in
small-talk.

ERIC
I was a farmer.

He turns back to the fire.

ERIC (CONT'D)
And now I'm here.

REYNOLDS
How come you know how to shoot so
good?

Silence.

REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
Were you in the army?

More silence.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
68.
CONTINUED: (2)
Eric tosses his empty food tin into the flames.
Reynolds seems used to the idea of people not engaging. He doesn't
press. He stares into the fire a long while, wearing his thinking
openly.
REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about that
little boy who died, but I can't.

ERIC
You shouldn't.

REYNOLDS
But I can't.

ERIC
You shouldn't stop thinking about him..
You should never stop thinking about a
life you've taken. It's the price you
pay for taking it.

Eric stares into the flames, then pulls his blanket over him and
lies back.

He stares into the sky a moment, then closes his eyes, leaving
Reynolds to think what he needs to think.

EXT. CAMPSITE - MORNING

Dawn. Reynolds sits up on the dirt beside the remains of the
extinguished fire. He rubs his eyes. His hair's a mess.

Eric sleeps.

Reynolds stands. He looks down at Eric and then around into the
bush. He lifts his blanket off the dirt, quietly, gently, then
creeps off into the scrub.

Eric sleeps.

EXT. SCRUB - MORNING

Reynolds treads lightly through the scrubland. He wraps his blanket
around his shoulders.

He glances back towards the campsite.

He keeps walking. He seems nervous, looking for something. He
glances back again.

 

 
69.

EXT. CAMPSITE ~ MORNING

Eric lies serene. Insect noise. A bird squawks somewhere in the far
distance.

And then the barrel of a high-powered automatic rifle appears above
his head.

His eyes open.
VOICE (0.S.)
That's the way. Let's start with the
eyelids,

We see two men standing over him. Cops in dirty paramilitary wear.
One covers Eric with an M-4.

cop 1
I want you to roll over on your front and
put your hands behind your back. Do it
slow.
Eric keeps watching him, not moving at all.

COP 1 (CONT'D)
And do it now.

Eric rolls over onto his front.

The cop steps over to him, kicking empty food tins out of the way
with his boot.

COP 1 (CONT'D)
You shoulda given those Abo kids some
money.

EXT. SCRUB - MORNING

Reynolds' ears prick. He is squatting under the tree, pants around
his ankles, shitting.

Through the scrub he can see figures moving. He can make out Eric,
hands flex-cuffed behind his back, being lifted off the ground and
led from the campsite.

INT. POLICE VEHICLE - DAY

Eric is in the back of a police vehicle as it passes through the
gates of a police complex.

One guard at the gate with a loose slung M-4 watches him as they
pass, then follows the car to the compound.

 

 

 
70.

EXT. POLICE COMPOUND - DAY

The vehicle enters a loosely fortified police compound - a squat,
concrete building flimsily surrounded by a tall wire fence.

INT. POLICE COMPOUND - DAY

Eric stands before an eye-reading machine having his eyeballs
scanned. The interior of this building, this office, feels worn
around the edges. A once modern institutional police building now
without maintenance, but which still has the functioning remnants of
modern technology.

And it feels quiet. It would once have been moving with cops,
administrative employees, people - but now it's being run by a tiny
handful of stretched and anxious guys, only two or three. The last
remaining fragments of governmental order.

The cop swabs the inside of Eric's mouth. He takes the mouth
swab to the counter and plastic-bags it.

COP 1
Sit in that chair.

Eric sits in a chair against the wall. He cooperates with all
instructions. He offers no resistance.

COP 1 (CONT'D)
When are you gonna say something, cunt?

ERIC
What do you want me to say?

COP 1
It's over. It's over for you.

ERIC
I know that.

COP 1
That's good that you know that.

ERIC
Do you know it too?

COP 1
I know it, champ. I told you it.

ERIC
Do you know it's over for you too?

The cop looks across coldly at Eric.

{CONTINUED )

 

 

 
CONTINUED:

71.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Whatever you think is over for me was over
a long time ago. I'm asking you about you.
Do you know it's over for you too?

COP 1
Is that meant to be a threat? Are you
threatening me?

ERIC
No. A threat means there's somewhere left
to go.

Eric looks at him, expressionless.

ERIC (CONT'D)
I murdered my wife... I followed her to a
man's house and I watched him put his
fingers inside her and so I killed them
both and no one ever came after me. Ten
years ago.

Eric watches the cop for a reaction. He doesn't get one.

ERIC (CONT'D)
That hurt me. I never had to explain
myself. I never had to lie to anyone. I
never had to confess to anyone. I didn't
need to run and hide. I buried them in a
hole and I went home. Ten years ago. And no
one came after me. And that hurt me more
than having my heart broken - was knowing
it didn't matter, Knowing you can do
something like that and no one comes after
you. You can do a thing like I did and it
should really mean something, but it
doesn't. It just doesn't matter anymore...
That's what hurt me.

COP 1
Well, champ, back in Abo town you went
and did the one thing that really
matters to us. Now you can do all the
lying and confessing you want.

ERIC
What are you going to do with me?

COP 1
You're going to Sydney.

ERIC
Why?

(CONTINUED)

 
72.
CONTINUED: (2)

CoP 1
Because that's the way it works. You get
sent to Sydney.

ERIC :
Why don't you just shoot me?

COP 1
I'd find that enjoyable,

ERIC
Then why don't you do it? That's what
everyone else is doing.

cop 1
Because us sending you to Sydney tells
Sydney there's some reason to keep paying
us what they pay us. If we just shot every
idiot we wanted to shoot, then pretty soon
they'd start wondering what the fuck we're
doing out here. I personally don't care
what happens to you. I don't care if you
get to Sydney and get let off or bribe your
way out or whatever happens there these
days. I don't give a fuck. I'm doing this
for me.

ERIC
You're doing what for you?

The cop ignores him, He's said too much already.
ERIC (CONT'D)

You're doing what for you? What is this job
you do?

 

Silence. Eric watches the cop.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Do you think when cavemen were rubbing
sticks together, or the Romans were
building their monuments to themselves,
they had a sense that everything was
moving forward, everything was
improving?... Because I remember having
that feeling once, It's just a feeling
of possibility, you know what I mean?
It's a feeling of something like
future... That's a powerful feeling. Do
you know what I'm talking about?

 

Eric leaves a space for the cop to answer, but then doesn't seem to
notice or care when he doesn't.

(CONTINUED )
73.
CONTINUED: (3)

ERIC (CONT’D)
This now doesn't feel like that. This
doesn't feel anything like possibility
anymore.

Eric sits wistfully on this.

ERIC (CONT’D)
You don't feel that?

COP 1
Mate, makes no difference to me. I don't
care what direction things are moving. What
the fuck are you even talking about? So
long as I've got somewhere to be everyday
is all I need to think about.

 

 

Eric thinks about this a moment, his eyes stay pinned and desolate
on the cop.

ERIC
I tried that.

He thinks some more. Then -

ERIC (CONT'D)
Do you have kids?

The cop ignores him. His blood is beginning to quietly boil.

 

ERIC (CONT'D)
I'm guessing you do.

 

The cop looks like he's ready hurt Eric.

And then they hear GUNSHOTS coming from somewhere else in the
building, Their ears prick.

The cop goes for his gun which is on his utility belt, draped over a
chair across the room.

Before he can remove it from its holster, Reynolds stumbles in and
shoots the cop dead.

 

Reynolds looks around coursing with naive excitement.

REYNOLDS
Is that it?

Reynolds stands, eyes wide, like a little kid just fallen off his
bike and can't believe he's not hurt.

 

(CONTINUED )

 
74.
CONTINUED: (4)

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
That was really easy.

He goes to the dead cop's belt and removes the keys to Eric's
handcuffs.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
Is that it? Was there only three of them?

Eric nods, vaguely stunned.
REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
That was so easy. I thought it was gonna be
way more harder.
Eric, watches Reynolds.

INT, POLICE COMPOUND - DAY

Eric and Reynolds walk through the front reception area of the
compound,

Reynolds leads the way, still coursing with adrenaline, past the
two blasted bodies of the other cops.

As they pass -
REYNOLDS
(pointing, giddy)
These two were just standing there.
EXT. POLICE COMPOUND - DAY
And then they step out into the light towards the Commodore,
parked askew out front of the building with its drivers door
hanging open.

The compound's front gate lies busted off its hinges behind the
car on the dirt.

INT. COMMODORE - DAY

Driving. A truck tears past the Commodore, heading in the opposite
direction on the flat and barren highway.

They drive, not speaking, strangely contemplative, lost in their
individual thoughts.

Then Reynolds starts looking round, trying to get a fix on where
they are, looking for familiar landmarks. It’s difficult in this dry
wasteland. It's farming land, horribly drought-stricken, dead trees
and endless brown.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 
75.
CONTINUED:

REYNOLDS
I'm pretty sure we need to turn somewhere
up here on the left.

They drive further. Reynolds watches the roadside. Wind and dust
tear in through the windshield.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
Here it is. Up here.

The Commodore approaches a small rusted sign.
It reads ‘CARLOON',

Eric takes the Commodore off the highway and onto a smaller sealed
road heading away into the scrub.

EXT. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric and Reynolds stand beside the car, parked by the side of the
road behind a small clump of trees.

It's late afternoon. The sun is low in the sky.

Reynolds points to a small house perched on a gentle hill slope in
the distance.

REYNOLDS
You take the little dirt road that's about
another mile up the way here and it leads
straight up there.

ERIC
Are they alone up there?

REYNOLDS
For now they are. Until them other people
arrive, but that ain't gonna be for another
week, I guess. And there'll be Gordon up
there too who's the guy whose house it is,
but he's really old.

ERIC
You know all this.

Reynolds looks straight ahead. Defiant.

REYNOLDS
I know it.

Eric looks up at the house a little while longer, thinking. He wants
to get up there right away, but knows this isn't wise.

{CONTINUED )

 

 
76.
CONTINUED:
ERIC
We're gonna find somewhere to pitch down.
It's better we go up there at dawn.
There'll be less trouble at dawn.
Eric climbs back behind the wheel of the Commodore.

Reynolds stays looking up at the house, at his brother, at his
future - whatever it is.

Eric watches Reynolds, like he knows what he's thinking.
INT. COMMODORE - NIGHT

Reynolds sits behind the wheel of the stationary car, staring into
the surrounding black.

He's thinking again.

The car radio is on quietly. The barely tuned, barely discernible
crackle of a pop song (something like ‘Don't Cha' by The Pussycat
Dolls) from some distant, still functioning radio station.

He looks like his thinking is heavy, but then he sings along to
the last chorus of the song, like there's been a shift, like he's
settled on something.

He switches off the radio and gets out of the car.

EXT. SCRUB LAND - NIGHT

Eric is already lying on his side by a small dwindling fire, his
back to Reynolds.

Reynolds sits at the fire. He looks around for a stick within reach,
finds one, pokes the fire with it.

REYNOLDS
I'm gonna kill him.

Eric's eyes open.

REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
I'm gonna kill Henry.

Reynolds stays sitting, staring into the fire.
Eric lies still, eyes open.

A few moments pass.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
77.
CONTINUED:
REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
There's money up there too we could take
if we wanted.

ERIC
Go to sleep.

Reynolds stares into the fire a while longer, thinking.
He then lies down and shuts his eyes.

Eric lies still, eyes open.

And then they shut.

EXT. SCRUB LAND ~ PRE-DAWN

The sky is pre-dawn purple.

Reynolds kicks dirt on the dead, smoking fire.

Eric ties his shoelaces.

They carry their meagre supplies to the Commodore and dump them in
the back seat.

Neither speak.

INT. COMMODORE - DAWN

 

The sun begins to rise and the sky pinkens.

Eric drives.

Reynolds sits beside him, wearing his big specs.

Both watch the road ahead in silence.

EXT. ROAD - DAWN

The Commodore leaves the road and heads up a long dirt drive.

The drive is rocky and lined either side by wire fence. Few if any
trees.

INT. COMMODORE - DAWN
Neither speak.
The ride is dusty and rough.

The house appears in the distance. All seems quiet.

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:

And Eric can now see his Falcon out front.
EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAWN

Eric pulls the Commodore to a stop a good hundred metres from the
house.

He kills the engine.
INT. COMMODORE - DAY

Eric looks ahead to his Falcon and the house. A big beautiful black
HORSE is tethered to its front porch.

Eric looks over at Reynolds beside him, fiddling with his gun. He
seems nervous, lost in his own world.

Eric opens his door.
EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAWN
Eric and Reynolds climb out of the car.

Eric looks over to Reynolds across the Commodore's roof and motions
‘shhh’. He quietly presses his door shut. Reynolds does the same.

Eric checks his handgun's safety and shoves it down the front of his
pants.

He then starts towards the house.
Reynolds follows close behind, clutching his handgun.

They make the long walk towards the house, their feet crunching
anxiously in the dirt.

Between them and the house sits Eric's Falcon, some fifty metres
from the front porch.

They approach it. Eric runs his hand along its bonnet. He reaches
the driver's door and looks inside.

The keys are hanging from the ignition,

Eric quietly opens the car door. He stops and looks over at
Reynolds, a few yards behind him.

Reynolds watches him back, suddenly confused.
Eric walks back to meet him.

Reynolds is in a state of quiet panic.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

 
79.
CONTINUED:

He speaks quietly, but not quietly enough.

REYNOLDS
What are you doing?

Eric places his hand over Reynolds' mouth.
ERIC
(whispering)
I'm leaving.

Reynolds pulls Eric's hand away. He's quiet, but still not quiet
enough.

REYNOLDS
Ain't you gonna help me?

Eric backs away from Reynolds and his noise.

ERIC
I got what I came for.

Eric turns and heads back to the Falcon.
He climbs behind the wheel.
I/E. ERIC'S FALCON - DAWN

Eric looks up again at Reynolds who hasn‘t moved from his spot on
the dirt, clutching his guns.

Eric slips the car into neutral and, with one foot still on the
ground, he gives it a push.

The Falcon begins to roll, gravel crackling underneath.
Eric pulls the door shut gently.

Reynolds watches him, seemingly terrified, as the car rolls past,
back down the drive.

As Eric steers the rolling car away, he looks in his rearview.

Reynolds watches him, abandoned, and then turns and continues his
walk towards the house.

Eric rolls a few feet further and then brakes the Falcon,
He sits for a brief moment, watching Reynolds’ uncertain lope.
ERIC

(to himself)
Goddammit.

(CONTINUED)

 
80.
CONTINUED:

He opens the Falcon's door.
EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAWN

Eric steps out of the car and walks quickly after Reynolds, breaking
into a half-jog every few steps. He pulls his pistol from his pants.

He makes a hissing noise to catch Reynolds' attention.

Reynolds turns. He stops and smiles.

Eric holds his finger up - no talking.

They walk the last few feet towards the front porch together.
Reynolds is in front. As Eric passes the big horse tied to the
veranda post, he looks into its black doleful eyes. Everything feels

to be moving in slow motion.

Up on the front porch, Reynolds reaches for the handle to the front
door.

Eric grabs his shoulder and pulls him back. He hand-motions for them
both to head round the side of the house.

Eric leads the way, treading quickly but quietly.
They round the corner and come upon a venetian window.

Eric halts Reynolds and then darts his head for a look inside the
room,

Eric motions to Reynolds that they must duck and proceed beneath the
window's sill. They do so.

They round the next corner to the rear of the house.
Eric stops Reynolds at the back door, motions for him to wait.

Eric creeps over to a back window and glances inside. He pulls back.
He glances again, double-checking, then retreats to the back door.

He hand-signals to Reynolds: two in the side room, two in the back
room. He points to himself and then the back room, then to Reynolds
and then the side room ~ ‘I'll take the back, you take the side.'

He leans in close to Reynolds.
ERIC
(whispers)

No shooting. Bring them into the living
room. Understand?

(CONTINUED)

 
81.
CONTINUED:

Reynolds nods.

Eric leads the way to the back door.

He lifts the latch to the fly-screen door and pulls it open
delicately. The back door is open, inches ajar. Eric nudges it open
gently.

INT. FARM HOUSE —- DAY

They step inside the house softly. Eric lets Reynolds enter and then
eases the door closed.

Eric and Reynolds look at each other. Reynolds seems nervous. They
move off separate directions.

INT, FARM HOUSE / BEDROOM 1 -~ DAY

The door to the bedroom is nudged open by the barrel of Eric's
handgun. It swings open silently. Eric steps inside.

Two men are asleep on single beds. It's Archie and Caleb.
Eric pulls his handgun from his pants, shotgun in his other hand.

He steps across the room to Caleb's bed and slowly brings the
handgun's barrel to rest against his throat.

Caleb wakes with a start.

CALEB
Fuckin -

Archie wakes. Eric raises the handgun directly at him.

ERIC
(quietly)
Don't move and don't talk.

CALEB
Who the fuck ~

Short and sharp, Eric clocks Caleb on the forehead with the butt of
his gun.

ERIC
(to Caleb)
What'd I just say about not talking?
(to Archie)
You, Throw the blanket off.

Archie throws his bed covers down. He's wearing underpants.

(CONTINUED)

 

 

 

 
82.

ERIC (CONT'D)
(to Caleb)
Now you. Raise your head off the pillow.
Slow.

Caleb lifts himself up slowly.

Eric reaches behind his head and pulls the pillow away. A handgun
piss underneath it. Eric reaches down and sweeps the handgun off the
It CLATTERS on the floor.

INT. FARM HOUSE / BEDROOM 2 - DAY

Reynolds is startled by the SOUND from the other bedroom.

He stands timidly in the room, his gun pointed at the sleeping
figures of Henry in one bed and an old man, GORDON, in another.

REYNOLDS
(meekly)
Henry.

No response, Henry snores.
REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
(louder)
Henry. Wake up.
Still no response.
REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
(louder)
’ Henry, wake up.

Henry stirs in his bed and looks up over the covers at his brother
who is pointing a gun at him.

HENRY

Rey?

REYNOLDS
You gotta get up.

HENRY
What the fuck?

REYNOLDS
You gotta get up.

HENRY
What are you doing here?

Gordon grunts awake in his bed.
REYNOLDS
You too, Gordon. You gotta get up. You both
gotta get up outta bed.
Henry sits up in bed, wondering if he's still dreaming.
HENRY
What are you doing? Stop pointing that
thing at me.
REYNOLDS
Don't make me keep saying it that you gotta
get up outta bed.
Gordon has swung himself up to be sitting on the edge of his bed,
languidly rubbing his eyes. He's in pyjamas, searching the floor
with his feet for his slippers. He's an old man. He doesn't seem to
think it's strange that Reynolds is standing in the room brandishing
a gun.
INT. FARM HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eric leads Caleb and Archie into the living room at gunpoint.
Caleb's in boxer shorts, Archie in underpants.

ERIC
sit.

Both men know not to speak. They sit.

Eric wonders where the hell Reynolds is. He peers out towards the
other bedroom.

ERIC (CONT'D)
Sit on your hands.

Caleb and Archie sit on their hands.

Eric takes a few steps back for a better view into Henry's bedroom.
He can just make out the edge of Reynolds’ back in the doorway.

ERIC (CONT'D)

What's going on in there?
INT. FARM HOUSE / BEDROOM 2 ~ DAY

Reynolds gets anxious with Henry, who sits defiantly in bed.

He won't get up outta bed.
INT. FARM HOUSE / LIVING ROOM ~ DAY

Eric strains to see into the bedroom while keeping an eye on Caleb
and Archie.

ERIC
Get him out here. Stick the gun in his
face.

INT. FARM HOUSE / BEDROOM 2 - DAY

Reynolds turns back to Henry who is now holding a handgun of his own
and pointing it at him.

Gordon is sitting on the edge of the bed, his slippers on, strangely
detached and uninterested.

HENRY
Put the gun down, Rey.

REYNOLDS
You put yours down.

HENRY
Put it down, Rey. I'm warning you, Why are
you doing this?

ERIC (0.S.)
What's going on?

Eric's getting anxious. This isn't how this situation was supposed

Archie shifts in his seat.

ARCHIE

HENRY
If you don't put it down now, I'm gonna

REYNOLDS
(softer)
I thought you was my brother.

Reynolds is quietly distraught. He accidently squeezes the trigger,
scaring himself.

The bullet smacks into the wall beside Henry's head.
A split second ~ Reynolds looks frightened, apologetic.

Henry fires, hitting Reynolds square between the eyes. Reynolds
drops hard to the ground.

INT. FARM HOUSE / LIVING ROOM ~ DAY

At the sound of the blast from the other room, Eric makes a snap
decision.

He shoots Caleb and Archie quick~fire - CRACK CRACK - straight in
their foreheads with his handgun. They die instantly.

Eric then moves quickly across the room and stands, back to the
wall, outside Henry's bedroom.

Reynolds has fallen backwards, half out the doorway into the hall.
He lies face-up, head trauma, dead near Eric's feet.

A GUN BLAST cracks, splintering wood from the door frame beside
Eric's head.

Eric hits the floor, expecting a new barrage.
It doesn't come.

And then, Henry's handgun clatters onto the hall floor. Henry has
thrown it out.

Eric stands. He proceeds warily to the bedroom door. He creeps
around the corner, gun raised,

He enters the room.
INT. FARM HOUSE / BEDROOM 2 ~ DAY

Henry is still sitting on the bed, looking at the corpse of his
brother. He's crying and angry.

Gordon is still sitting on the edge of his bed. The fact he still

dementia of some kind.

Eric flinches.

What did you do to my brother?!

Eric doesn't know what to say.
Henry gets angrier.

HENRY (CONT'D)
What did you do to my fuckin brother!?

Eric stands, speechless, gun raised. What did he do to this guy's
brother? Did he do anything?

HENRY (CONT'D)
Answer me. What did you do to him?!

ERIC
I didn't do anything.

Henry is getting enraged.

HENRY
Yeah, you did.

He lifts himself out of bed. He moves towards Bric.

HENRY (CONT'D)
What did you do to him!?

Eric squeezes the trigger, shooting Henry in the chest.

Henry drops with a thud of old mattress springs back onto the bed -
then silence.

Eric remains calm, but his head is swimming.

Henry lies with his head against the headboard ~ either dead or
seconds from it - staring back at Eric.

Eric swings the gun over to Gordon, sitting on the edge of his bed,

now looking straight at Eric. The two men watch each other for a
moment. Gordon is somewhere else.

(CONTINUED )

 

 
8B.
CONTINUED: (2)

Eric takes a breath and lowers his gun, taking stock of the mess all
around him.

EXT. FARM HOUSE — DAY
Eric walks down off the front veranda, gun by his side.

The big, black horse is still by the veranda - unmoved and
unchanged. He runs his hand down its face.

He walks to his Falcon, reaches in the driver's side and opens the
door.

He climbs behind the wheel.

INT. FALCON ~ DAY

He starts the engine. The car growls to life and purrs.
He sits a moment and then puts it in gear.

The car moves off.

Eric looks wounded at the battered wreck of the Commodore as he
passes.

EXT. ROAD ~ DAY

Eric drives, alone and drained.
He drives a long way.

Landscapes change.

He passes through decrepit towns.

He passes a wrecked car lying on its roof in the desert by the road.
A body lies decomposing beside it.

EXT. HILL - DAY

The sun is close to setting. Eric has been driving all day.

He takes the Falcon up a gentle grassy hill.

The hill is treeless bar one ancient eucalypt perched on its crest.
INT. FALCON ~ DAY

Eric steers the car up the hill.

This is the tree and the hill from the opening still image. The tree
under which Eric once sat happy.

 

 
a9.

EXT. HILL - DAY

The Falcon follows the vague dirt track and comes to a stop only
metres from the tree.

Its engine switches off.

It sits there a moment in eerie silence. A light breeze shakes the
tree's leaves.

I/E. FALCON - DAY

Eric sits at the wheel, contemplative, looking out over the fields
below.

These fields, the hill itself, are much drier and browner than the
semi~verdant still photograph from the opening.

Eric climbs out of the car and goes to the trunk.
He opens it and looks inside,

He leans in and pulls out a shovel.

He carries the shovel over to the tree,

He tosses the shovel beneath the tree and moves back to the trunk
of the car.

He reaches in and gently lifts out the lifeless body of a BROWN
DOG.

He cradles it in his arms and walks it gently over to the tree.
Eric places the dog down softly beneath the tree and sits.

He sits beneath the tree, between dog and shovel, and looks out at
the view. He looks like he's reached the end of a road. He looks
like he has no idea where he might go after this place. He looks
like he might cry.

He gently strokes the dead dog's scruff.

He stands.

He picks the shovel off the ground and drives it into the earth and
digs.

THE END.
