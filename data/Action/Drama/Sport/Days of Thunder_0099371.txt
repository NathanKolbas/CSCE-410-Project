FADE IN: A SERIES OF BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS

starting with a thirty-four Ford. The copper stills in
mountain mists; lean and hungry men and boys loading Mason
Jars and gallon tin drums of liquor into cars in cowpastures;
the cars speeding up, down and around the mountains, pursued
by relentless revenuers.

LONE VOICE
(singing)
Let me tell the story
I can teli it all
About the mountain boy who ran
illegal alcohol.

Daddy made the whiskey

Son, he drove the load

And when his engine roared

They called the highway Thunder Road.

Silence. Only the photo of the ‘34 Ford remains.

A crawl:
‘Wherever they drove they discovered
the automobile did more than help them
make a living. It gave them a reason
to live.*

FADE: The silence is SHATTERED by the sound of rolling
thunder, rolling and growing, growing until it’s an
earsplitting, toothrattling, earthquaking all engulfing wave
of thunder times forty:

EXT DAYTONA SPEEDWAY (DAY)

Forty stock cars in a blaze of sound and color have started
their engines. Begin CREDITS. The engines’ roar gives way
to a throbbing score and CAMERA races through the riot and
pageantry of the Daytona 500. Green, black, red, yellow,
white and checkered ~ all the flags that rule the thunder
wave past, the gold of Miller High Life, the
bullseye-day-glo-orange of Tide, the black bandit of
Goodwrench, these cars fly past, the snaky pit lizards with
their pick-me-up-and-fuck-me boots, the cooler carrying good
old boys totin’ more beer and more pussy and more Kabies, the
pit crews immaculately uniformed in Folger’s Red and Quaker
State green, the drivers sliding into uniforms and cars,
their dashboards with XEREX~VALVOLINE-COORS crests, each
driver a King in his commercial fiefdom, about to risk it all
in roaring battle, the wives holding their babies, anxiously
watching, spotters on the phones, ESPN crews going crazy
before a bank of tv monitors of all the above, the drivers
seated on folding chairs their heads bent in prayer and the
slogan under the Reverend, "with God you’re always a winner,"
the prowling pit Nazis of NASCAR, the battalions of
reporters, and more Miss Darlingtons and frizzy headed honey
legged blondes, the banks of suites behind windows where
money and power watch the pageantry below, all this in the
few seconds before -
  

Nov 20 1989. 2.

BOB JENKINS
This is it, welcome to Daytona and
another year of Winston Cup
racing, as forty of the top
drivers in the country begin their
annual quest, a furious assault on
the most coveted prize in auto
racing, the Winston Cup -

Shots of the cup and past winners.

NED JARRETT
- thirty races at 16 tracks ina
grueling season that runs from
February to November, from short
half-mile high banked tracks like
Bristol, where you feel like
you're running around the inside
of a cereal bowl, to the 2.66
miles of the Talladega
International Speedway -

Quick shots - featuring the bunched, bee-buzzing of
Martinsville and Bristol - and the long sweeping..speed of
Daytona and Talladega - where a car does get airborne and
crashes through the guard rail.

BOB JENKINS
~ the longest race is 600 miles,
the shortest 218. Depending on
the race, the winner will take
home anywhere from fifty to two
hundred thousand dollars and at
the end, when the last flag is
thrown, all the victories and all
the points added up, the Winston
Champion takes home the Cup, a
check for a million dollars and
the appreciation of over 3,000,000
fans, the largest attendance for
any motor sport in America -

NED JARRETT
~ but today, Bob Jenkins, these
drivers have only one thing on
their mind, the crown jewel, the
superbowl of racing - the Daytona
500.

Old black and white shots of Daytona beaches, cars racing and
spinning and spitting sand, to early black and whites of the
newly completed Daytona and legendary drivers like Fireball
Roberts and legendary glamor queens like Linda Vaughan -
Nov 20 1989. . 3.

NED JARRETT V.O.
It was here on the beaches that
big Bill France first saw the
future, and out of the sands built
this 2.33 mile monument to
super-speed, the Daytona
International Speedway ~

A SOFT SOUTHERN VOICE
(genteel and discreet)
~ scuse me, Tim. But I got some
guy from a construction company
out there -

INT CITY CHEVROLET (DAY) : 3

TIM DALAND the youthful owner of City Chevrolet has just been
torn away from the television in his customer’s lounge by
Junior Byrd, his manager.

JUNIOR
(pointing toward showroom)
- wants to buy some vehicles.

Tim nods slowly, eyes drifting back toward the tiv.

JUNIOR
~ a number of vehicles. Trucks,
cars...

Tim nods, watching the race coverage.

JUNIOR
(patiently going on)
- six short wheel based pick-ups,
a couple of long wheels, a pair of
full sized Caprice’s...

Tim looks grudgingly to Junior, impressed.

JUNIOR
{an added feature)
Lotta cars, Tim - plus he doedn‘t
have a thing to trade. Naturally
he wants to talk to the dealer.

Tim nods.

DALAND
Won’t be but a minute -

JUNIOR
Race startin?

Tim nods helplessly.
JUNIOR

Hell, then. 1/11 tell him to
forget the whole deal.
   

Nov 20 1989. 4a.

Tim glances up at Junior who smiles, indicates he will take
care of the customer somehow. Tim turns back to the set.

ON THE T.V. - NED JARRETT AND BENNY PARSONS

continue with their coverage showing Waltrip, Bodine,
Earnhardt behind the mesh in their cars with photo inserts of
their faces. Then Rowdy Burns being interviewed by his Exxon
Chevy Lumina:

NED JARRETT
- of course last year’s winner
here, Rowdy Burns, is settin’ out
there on the pole, with the
fastest qualifying run, a
blistering 196.71 miles an hour.

BENNY PARSONS
Well if Rowdy’s there for the last
lap I wouldn’t want to bet against
him.

NED JARRETT
Nossir. But it does remind me,
Benny, that as stiff as the
competition is, in one sense
Daytona is going to be a little
easier for all the drivers this
year. Perhaps we should take this
moment to remember two men who
won’t be here, the fabled Buddy
Bretherton and his equally
legendary crew chief, Harry Hogge.

Capsule bio of Harry Hogge and Buddy Bretherton: moving from
black and white to color, they win race after race at track
after track.

NED JARRETT V.O.
- one year ago today, here at
Daytona, tragedy struck. After an
uncharacteristic pre-race dispute
between the two men, Buddy
Bretherton died, hitting the wall
at over 195 miles an hour. Then,
late in the year NASCAR president
Bill France announced he’d
received a communication from
Harry Hogge, announcing "my
decision to withdraw, ‘finally and
irrevocably’ from the Winston Cup
Series." So it’s proven a double
loss for racing, Bob.

The film parallels the narrative, culminating in Bretherton‘s
erash, funeral, and photo insert of Hogge, along with a
superimposed quote from Harry’s Dear Bill letter.

BOB JENKINS
Yes indeed, Ned. But the race
goes on ~ pace car is on the
track,

EXT DAYTONA a ‘5
Forty cars, engines rumbling with controlled rage, patrol the
straightaway. They are immaculate, their colors shiny in

this last glorious moment before battle. Pit men are poised,

the crowds surge, the flag is up. Then:

SPOTTER’S VOICE
(excited, through radio
static) .
~ pace car’s off, pace car’s off -

The pace car has swung into pit lane. Then as it waves:

ANOTHER SPOTTER’S VOICE
~ green flag! green flag!
GO!Go!Go!

His voice is lost as the car colors blur into sound and fury
and blinding speed. \

FADE:

with City Chevrolet on the frame surrounding the North
Carolina license plates. It plods up a road ~ two red ruts
with weeds between them - toward a corrugated metal barn like
structure set in a cow pasture.

TIM DALAND

gets out of his car. Next to the barn is a Chevy truck with
City Chevrolet on its license frame. Despite threatening
weather, Daland is perspiring in his suit and tie. it’s
eerily quiet. The only signs of life are cows grazing by the
crumpled and rusty frames of a couple of race cars, bones in
an elephant graveyard. The barn door is ajar. Tim looks in.

INT HARRY HOGGE’S GARAGE 7

immaculate as a laboratory. ‘Trophies and tools, and
memorabilia are on benches and shelves; calendars of fine
southern ladies adorn the walls. The hull of one racing car
sits alone on the otherwise barren garage floor.

Tim hears the sound of a piece of machinery kicking over in
the distance, then a louder THWACK.

Harry doesn’t hear it over the havoc he’s wreaking.

‘He finally notices the dog is upset. He turns and sees
Daland clearing the rise in a meadow and approaching, coat
slung over shoulder, tie loosened.

Harry looks, then continues on with his tractor. . _*

Daland arrives and allows himself to be ignored. He watches
Harry plow through the fence.

DALAND
(shouting)
Looks like you're enjoying the
easy life, Harry.

HARRY
Well I don’t mind spreading a *
little fertilizer around now *
and then- gettin’ the grass to *
grow. There’s worse things. *
DALAND
How’s the truck runnin?
HARRY
Runs good. \
DALAND
(shouting)
I want you to build me a car.
HARRY
You sell me a truck, I build *
you a car, is that the deal? *
DALAND
Sounds gocd to me. *
Harry turns off the tractor. There’s the sound of wind *
through trees. *
HARRY

Now Tim, everybody knows some
downtown car dealer can’t afford a
race team.. no driver worth a damn
is gonna sign with you. They
wreck one car, you can’t afford to
build ‘em another, and they’re
outta the deal you know? No car's
gonna win without a driver, not
even mine.

Harry turns the tractor back on.

DALAND
(shouting)
If you built the car, I’a geta
damn driver.

‘There’s surprising force coming from Daland. Harry turns
the tractor off again. He looks at Daland, sees the man

is desperate.

HARRY
What kinda driver you gonna get
after the season’s started? “Some
ol’ boy that’s washed up and
wasn’t worth a shit to begin with.

DALAND
You could work with him. vou can
build a driver like you build a

car, Harry.

HARRY
Tim, take a look at that hound -
he’s the best coon dog I ever seen
or heard about, and I didn’t teach
him a damn thing.

DALAND

Well I got somebody.

Harry, in spite of himself. \

Take a look at him.

HARRY

little for the first time.

HARRY
Tim..I give up racin’. You gotta
know that.

DALAND
You didn’t give up racing, Harry.
You quit to avoid an investigation
into Buddy’s crash at Daytona.

HARRY
I didn’t avoid any goddam
investigation!

DALAND
(going right on)
~ anyway I talked to NASCAR and
if you come back in there won't be
any investigaton.

How in the hell did you sell ’em

Jan 12 1990. 8.

DALAND

(right back)
I’m a hell of a salesman.

(then a smile)
- plus my wife's sister~in-law is
married to the Reverend Emery
Cantrell who happens to be the
Lieutenant Governor’s preacher.

Harry shakes his head. He’s stuck somewhere between
irritation and admiration.

HARRY .
You’re a hell of a salesman.

With that Harry starts up the tractor and takes off
leaving Daland wondering how good a salesman he really is.

DONNA (DAY) EXT. CHARLOTTE MOTOR SPEEDWAY

A young woman sits in a deck chair. She looks as though she
might be sunning herself but for the clipboard, the stopwatch
and the offscreen roar on the Charlotte Motor Speedway.

WIDE ANGLE CHARLOTTE MOTOR SPEEDWAY (DAY) ‘
From the infield

Tim Daland, Harry Hogge, and Rowdy Burns’ pit crew along with
interested spectators follow the progress of a single car,
the familiar dark menace, Rowdy Burns’ Exxon Chevy. It cuts
a perfect line into the third turn.

HARRY
{to Daland)
Now that’s a race car driver.

WADDELL, Rowdy Burns’ pit crew chief, moves his head phones
and leans into Harry.

WADDELL
When do you want the track?

HARRY
When you’re done.

WADDELL
We’re about there. When’s your
driver due?

They move toward Donna to check the time as Rowdy makes the
tunnel turn and crosses the stripe:

Rowdy Burns’ pit crew chief is excited as are the spectators.
He’s on-the radio eagerly telling Rowdy to come on in.

Daland and others glance down at the clipboard te catch the’

numbers. Donna holds it up for them to see. She’s converted
the 31:70 to 171.937 mph. Daland like everyone else is

impressed.
‘

WADDELL
(relieved and gracious)
So Harry. Where’d you say your
dyiver’s fron? ..

Barry looks to Daland.

DALAND “S
Oh - Eagle Rock.

Waddell thinks for a moment.

WADDELL
that’s up around Wilkesboro, idn’t
it?

DALAND

No. Round Glendale - California.

Rowdy Burns’ crew pause and look to their boss, Waddell.
Waddell looks to Harry. Harry looks to Daland.

HARRY
He’s a Yankee.

DALAND
- uhh - not exactly. If you’re
from California you're not a
Yankee..you’re not really
anything.

HARRY
You Said it -

Rowdy has purred up pit lane and arrived. He crawls out to
congratulations and it’s clear he’s pleased.
 

Nov 20 1989. 10.

ROWDY
{to Waddell)
- shocks are right, we’re dialed
in buddy, don’t change a thing -

He spots Harry and gives him a poke.

ROWDY
- hey you ain’t buried in
horsemanure after all, you’re
lookin’ pretty good -

HARRY
- you’re the one’s lookin’ good -

Rowdy leans up against his car with a sigh of relief.

ROWDY
- it hasn’t been easy, Harry, I’1l
guaran-damn-tee-ya. But -
(he winks and taps the car)
- this bitch is ready to run.

As he says this he happens to catch Daland’s eye. who is
eagerly listening and feels somehow a response is called for.

DALAND
I can’t tell you how much we all
appreciate you letting us use the
car, Mr. Burns.

The remark is ill timed. Rowdy freezes. His face loses all
expression and his eyes shine like a snake’s.

WADDELL

(quickly)
Now I told you about this Rowdy.
Harry’s got some new driver and
needs a car just to turn a coupla
laps. I told you it was Harry
Hogge who asked us - personally as
a favor.

Rowdy turns, very slowly, to Harry.

ROWDY
Who is this driver?
(to crew)
Turn her off.

The engine’s turned off. But the sound continues unabated -
as though it has been disconnected from the car and magically
tossed over to the track entrance - two dark tunnels, one for
entering, one for exiting. Everyone - Harry, Rowdy Burns and
his crew, Daland, paramedics, firemen, a couple of other
drivers working on their cars - turn to look.

like the twin barrels of a gigantic shotgun. The growing
¥Yoar sounds not unlike echoing gunfire.

Materializing out of the right tunnel on a gleaming
piss-elegant Harley-Davidson, hair Calvin Klein
model-coiffed, wearing designer shades, Armani slacks and
shirt, and with one of these fashionable formless Japanese
designer overcoats flapping like a silk flag in the breeze
behind him, is COLE TRICKLE. He cides straight down the
track toward camera and an astonished crew.

glare, and what is starting to look like a circus and a
potentially spectacular display of incompetence.

Cole stops what he’s doing. He takes a careful look at

in the bag.

Harry with Daland watches anxiously. The car makes its way
through the one-two turn. It purrs at what appears to be a
leisurely pace down the backstretch. It continues on into
the third turn.

spewing smoke, rubber and blinding speed. As Cole nears the

watch hand. The watch is not running.

Thée Winston sign rushes towards us at speeds that make
everything previous look fluid and leisurely - the speed
looks like a series of speed-of-light still photographs. The
sound seems like it will shred the cockpit.

Cole completes one-two and flies down the backstretch.
There’s a growing buzz of excitement from the spectators.
Harry is struck dumb.

getting a kick out of it. Rowdy is not amused.

Suddenly, the Exxon Chevy is through the turn, perfectly
controlled and speeding on a plumbline toward the camera and

the finish line.

He hits them much more forcefully than Rowdy had nudged him -
sending one car fishtailing and smoking into the infield
grass, the other into the wall where it bends another fender,
not before it caroms off a couple of other cars, however,
causing them in turn to bump other cars.

who is drenched with sweat and dirt, his shoes smoking from
the heat coming up from the floorboard.

Harry spits at Cole’s feet and walks off. Cole is furious.

FROM PIT TO PIT - EXT. MICHIGAN TRACK 51

Harry and his over-the-wall gang watch one calamity after
another. Daland is there on occasion to share their mounting
misery:

1. At Michigan the field of forty sits becalmed under
a red flag. Cole looks thoroughly disgusted, but
he’s near the front of the pack.

Sure enough they‘re eating ice cream cones. Harry and the

Cole as he goes past.

can’t believe what he’s seen. He nearly hits another driver

leaps the wall and goes after Harry, getting tangled up with
deck chairs, smeared with ice cream, and being restrained by
crew.

INT CITY CHEVROLET (DAY)

Daland, exceptionally well dressed in a dark suit, presides
over his racing team’s meeting which includes the entire pit

The team leaves. Harry and Cole stay behind - silence.

Then:

DALAND
{almost casual)
I’ve got a question. What’s the
one thing you absolutely need to
do to win a race?

Harry starts to answer.

DALAND
You keep quiet!

Daland turns to Cole.

DALAND
You need to finish the race.

COLE
(to Daland)
It would help to have a car that
didn’t blow engines.

HARRY

(to Daland)
- if he wouldn’t get excited and
over rev the sumbitch the engine
wouldn’t blow!

(with elaborate sarcasm)
- now Cole when you shift the gear
and that little needle on the tac

He sure as hell does! how can he
expect to race if he don’t know
what a race car can and can’t do?

COLE *
What is this shit? you want me to
work the pit and you drive? fine
we'll try that -

Cole storms out into the used car lot. Harry is a little too
worried to be altogether surly.

DALAND
So he’s been trying too hard.
What would you prefer Harry?
That he not try hard enough?

Harry glances uneasily over at Daland.

HARRY
I can’t talk to the sumbitch.

DALAND
Think he can drive?

Harry turns and paces angrily.

HARRY

Oh he can drive. He can drive
beyond the limits of the tires,
the engine, the car or anything
else -

(he supresses a belch)
- if the sumbitch’d listen to me,
we wouldn’t hardly ever lose a

Harry’s coon dog meanwhile has leapt out of the crew van and
caught up to the two of them. It tries to get Harry to play.
Harry finds a pebble and heaves it. The dog goes tearing
off.

runnin’ road courses where there’s
this gentlemen’s agreement nobody
gets too close to each other, cos
when open wheel tires so much as

car at a time around the turn. Cole is the thirty-third car
through the turn and can be seen subsequently on the

WITH COLE ~- TRACK 76

He ducks into turn two barely getting in front of the fourth
car he passes. As he does his left tire hits the grass and
the car swerves kicking up dirt. Jarrett lets us know that
this is not unusual in turn two, drivers have to put their
left tire on the grass to get through it, it is so narrow and
treacherous. As Cole exits Parsons points out that the cars
have to hit this narrow ten foot patch or they’re liable to
hit the wall.

TOWARD TURN THREE

Cole glimpsed moving out and around two more cars.
Superimpose: Turn 3 banking: 6 degrees radius: 800 feet.

NED JARRETT V.O.
- the third turn is critical in
that if you don’t get off it good
you aren’t going down to the front
straightaway very fast which is
where you take the checkered
flag -

Ned and Benny agree that if you’ve got the lead on this track
near the end of a race you’re gonna have to be beaten in the

straightaways - you can’t pass on the turns without ending up
in the wall or on the infield.

INT CAR COLE (MOVING) 77

roaring along smocthly in a pack of cars only inches from
each other.

SPOTTER
(on radio)
~ crash in turn one! crash in
turn one! it’s gonna be comin’ up
in the bottom of the track Cole!

: . ~- TRACK 78
Suddenly Cole rips into a thick cloud of smoke and sparks
and cars twisting in front of his face. He jerks the wheel
to the right, avoids the fiery pile-up - slides perilously
close to the boilerplate wall through the turn.

INT. COLE 79

HARRY
(on radio)
- nice driving, good job -

But a loose wheel on fire has rolled from the infield grass
back onto the track - just where Cole comes off the turn.
The flames fan his fender.

HARRY’S VOICE
- you okay? you okay?

COLE
- just dodged another bullet.

HIGH ANGLE FIRST TURN - TRACK/PITS 80

Three cars are out. Paramedics have rushed in. Jarrett and
Parsons remind us of the track’s dangers. Jerry Punch on pit
road has a quick word with one of the drivers - hard luck
Aldo Benedetti, the gifted engineer who’s built his own car
which is now in shards around hin.

THE YELLOW FLAG IS FLYING - PITS 81
Rowdy Burns swings onto pit road.
INT. COLE 82

HARRY’S VOICE
- leader has just taken the flag!

Can I stay out?

HARRY’S VOICE
~- better play monkey-see-

Nov 20 1989. . 37.

- PITS 83
Cole comes flying into pit road. The over-the-wall-gang
leap into action. It’s a classic pit stop - ballsy ballet,
a controlled frenzy of flying bodies, gas hoses, jackhammers
and tires ~ the car hits the road in less than 13 seconds.
The time runs superimposed on the screen.

HARRY
Go! go! go!

HIGH ANGLE ~ TRACK B84

Cole pulls back onto the track still under yellow. Jarrett
comments on the remarkable pit stop of Trickle’s City
Chevrolet crew under Harry Hogge - it’s allowed the young
rookie to get back on the track in under 13 seconds and pick
up several more positions on the field.

THE GREEN FLAG

at the stripe and cars roar across. Jarrett lets us know
that Cole Trickle is now 15th having moved up twenty
positions from 36th after ninety-six laps, nearly the
half-way mark of the race. ~

BENNY PARSONS V.O. :
~ the rookie seems to be running a
lot smoother today, Ned -

NED JARRETT V.O.
yes indeed, although he didn’t
qualify that good at the moment
Cole Trickle appears to have one
of the strongest cars on the

track.
~ PITS 85
At the pit with Harry stop watches are punched. The
computer is read. Cole crosses the stripe.

consistent.
THROUGH BINOCULARS - DALAND’S TRUCK 87

Daland watches from the top of the truck. He sees Cole pick
up another spot. Listens on his own phones:

HARRY‘’S VOICE
60:70, the leader’s 61:10, you’re
picking up over half a second a
lap now, back off or you’re
gonna burn up the damn tires, take
it easy -
     

Nov 20 1989. 38.

COLE’S VOICE
- I am taking it easy -

NED JARRETT
- moving into the number five spot
behind Harry Gant is Cole Trickle
in the 46 car -
DOWN THE STRAIGHTAWAY - TRACK 88
Cole passes Gant and Waltrip. He’s now in third position.

HARRY ’S VOICE
61:10 - leader’s 61:40

Harry and the crew can’t believe it -
NED JARRETT’S VOICE
- and there goes Cole Trickle
around Earnhardt -

Cole ducks in front of Mr. Goodwrench just before the turn -
barely making it. He’s now in second position.

ROWDY BURNS . -" INT. ROWDY 89
spots green and yellow in his mirror. He smiles. Cole moves

to pass him on the outside. Rowdy cuts him off. Cole

appears to have the quicker car. He nudges Rowdy. Rowdy

can’t believe it. He’s shocked at the bump.

COLE - INT. COLE 90

breaks out of Rowdy’s draft and moves to the outside. Nose
to nose, they roar into the deadly first turn.

NED JARRETT V.0O.
- somebody’s going to have to give
way here -

- TRACK 91
Rowdy returns the bump - sends Cole skittering to the wall.

BENNY PARSONS
- oh dear -

The car is sideways. It scrapes the wall.
AT THE PIT HARRY ~ PITS 92

is screaming inte the phones to back off. He can‘t be heard
over the roar.

COLE - INT. ROWDY 93
comes through the turn right on Rowdy’s ass. Rowdy is

surprised - and indignant when Cole nudges him again. He
momentarily looks back at Cole.
 

   

Nov 20 1989, 39.

WADDELL’S VOICE
Rowdy there’s a bunny rabbit on
the track!

- TRACK o4

Rowdy looks - sure enough there’s a rabbit paralyzed with

terror on the straightaway dead ahead. Rowdy moves to the

right. Cole dives to the inside, both men barely missing

the rabbit - but now Cole has position on the inside going
through the turn. He holds it. Burns tries to stay with

him but can’t. His car goes sideways and he nearly loses

his rear end - when they come out of the turn:

BENNY PARSON’S VOICE
- now there’s a good example of
what you were talking about Ned,
you just can’t pass on the outside
in turn three, the track is too
flat, the tires won't stick - not
even if you’re Rowdy Burns.

NED JARRETT
- we have a new leader here at the
AC Spark Plug 500 after 176 laps,
Cole Trickle - if he can hold on
for 24 more laps, he just could
win his first Winston Cup race,
how about that?

Harry and the pit crew are going nuts. - PITS 95
DALAND - DALAND‘S TRUCK 96
climbs down from the truck and rushes to the pits.
BACK ON THE TRACK - TRACK 97
Rowdy has inched up alongside Cole. He bumps him.
NED JARRETT V.O.
- well there they go tradin’ paint
again, Benny Parsons ~
BENNY PARSONS
- it’s door handle to door handle
all right, but as we’ve pointed
out Ned this is not a real
forgivin’ race track - I don’t see
how much longer they can keep this
up without getting into trouble -
WITH HARRY - PITts 98

He sees the two cars glued together like Siamese twins going
into turn three - he’s ready to jump out of his skin.
   

Nov 20 1989. 40.

HARRY
(into radio) .
All right, godammit that’s enough!
Either pass him and stay ahead
or give to him - you can’t play:
with Rowdy like this - he’s gonna
give you a reali ass ripping -

Harry watches as the two cars zoom past.

COLE’S VOICE
- relax Harry, Rowdy’s not gonna
last three more laps -

- TRACK 99
The cars approach turn one. The track narrows to one
groove. Rowdy and Cole race to it - Cole gets there first
but Rowdy’s gone too far, he can’t duck in. He goes high,
spins and smacks the wall. Cole comes smoothly out of the
turn.

COLE’S VOICE
- oops - one lap -

He plumblines down the straightaway as the caution flag comes
out.

NED JARRETT V.O.
- the caution’s out with just
under five laps to go, Cole
Trickle maintains the lead, and
Benny Parsons I believe he’s gonna
win this race -

HARRY’S VOICE .
- pit road’s open, come on in and.
get some tires -

- PITS/TRACK 100
Cole zooms into the pits. Other cars follow. The over-the-
wall-gang come up, jack up the car - and the lug nuts
stick. Then the air gun jams - and Cole is hoisted up in
the air screaming.

The pit crew scrambles around for another air gun. In the
other pits the drivers complete their stops and race back
onto the track.

Cole’s crew finally gets the tires changed. He charges back
onto the track. He finds himself behind Earnhardt and
Waltrip.

NED JARRETT’S VOICE
- well that’s a shame. What do
you think the problem was Benny?
    

Nov 20 1989. 41.

BENNY PARSON’S VOICE .
Well it appears the lug nuts stuck
- but when you come this far, you
hate to have it cost you the
race - particularly after you run
as good as Trickle has -

Harry is trying to reach Cole. - PITS 101

HARRY
Cole, Cole can you hear me? can

listens and looks positively stricken

HARRY
Now you ain’t beat. Not yet.

COLE’S VOICE
Well I’d like to know what the
hell I can do about it.

Daland wants to know too.

HARRY

Well first of all you don’t want
to get excited, Cole. You’re in
third place. That’s a pretty
respectable position -

(Cole starts swearing again}
- okay what you do is this. When
they shut off over there for turn
three, you just keep your foot on
the gas and drive right by ’em -
uhh - on the outside.

HARRY
{trying for calm)
Now Cole, the pace car’s about
xveady to duck on off, we don’t
have a whole lot of time to talk
about this -

COLE
Well tell me how -

HARRY
- well it’s cos we got a real good
set of matched tires on her -

COLE
What?

HARRY

(firmly)
- that’s why I wanted you to pit
in the first place, we been
savin’ ‘em for just such an
occasion, those tires are matched
perfect and staggered special,
your pit crew’s not dead in here,
we’re thinking of you.

Daland looks at Harry interested himself.

COLE
- all right Harry when it comes to
the car, I’1l take your word -

HARRY
- pace car’s off the track, if you
go to the outside you can hold
it -
     

Nov 20 1989. 43.

THE GREEN FLAG AND THE WHITE FLAG - TRACK 106

are waved simultaneously - Earnhardt, Waltrip and Cole cross
the stripe and roar to full speed.

NED JARRETT
- here we are under green in the
final lap of the AC Spark Plug 500
and going into the first turn it’s
Earnhardt, Waltrip and Trickle -

The cars go through the narrow turn nose to tail.
BENNY PARSONS

- it pretty much looks like that’s

the order of finish here Ned with

one lap to go -
The cars head toward the tunnel turn nose-to-tail and move
down the straightaway going inte turn three with Earnhardt
leading, Waltrip trying to break the draft and move outside,

with Cole just behind Waltrip. They hit turn three. Waltrip
is slightly outside Earnhardt and Cole is outside Waltrip.

THE THREE CARS - TRACK 110
tear into the turn. Cole on the outside has all four tires
smoking as he lays rubber and fishtails wildly into the loose
stuff. His car goes completely sideways. Through the roar

of the crowd Jarrett’s incredulous reaction to Cole’s move

can be heard.

continues to slide and fishtail toward the wall. He keeps
his foot on the gas.

ANGLE ON THE STRIPE

The three cars streak toward it - with the green nose of
Cole’s car just inches ahead of the other two. Cole takes
the checkered flag.

BENNY PARSONS

(flabbergasted)
- Ned I should know better. Just
when I say somethin’ can’t be done
on a race track some rookie’s
gonna come along and make a liar
outta me - he come off that last
corner like he was tied to a
string, didn’t he?

COLE AT VICTORY LANE 114

is hauled out of the car by his riotous crew. Photographers
and Dr. Jerry Punch (with ESPN mike) surround him. Cole
grabs Harry, hugging him.

COLE
(affectionately)
- I owe it all to you, you son of
a bitch.

HARRY
- oh hell -

PUNCH
Cole Trickle, did you have any
idea you could go wide open on
that last turn and make the car
stick like that?

Cole is all smiles.

COLE
Knew it all along.

PUNCH
- how’s that?

COLE
Special tires.

He points to the tires. Punch looks down at them, puzzled.

PUNCH
What’s special about ‘em?

HARRY
(reluctantly)
- nothin’ particular..

COLE
(pulling Harry aside)
- but you told me -
   

Nov 20 1989. 45.

HARRY
- well I lied, I had to tell you
somethin’ to calm you down, you
was acting like such a candy~ass
after the air gun stuck, figured
you’d never get back on a race
track -

COLE
~ you son of a bitch!

He goes after Harry, but Daland and the crew hit the would-be
warriors with champagne spray and their hostility -is drowned
in bubbly. Both men laugh.

Photographs are taken - a rapid series of freeze frames as
Cole goes through the victory ritual of doffing dozens of
race sponsor hats. Daland interrupts the freeze frame flow:

DALAND
Try this on for size.

Cole and Harry look at the hat. It says Superflo. Daland
puts it on Cole’s head, another on Harry’s head, one more on
his own. :

DALAND
We got us a sponsor!

More champagne over the three of them. Through the shower:

HARRY
- promise me somethin’, boys.
Whatever else we do from here - we
win Daytona -

Before Cole can answer he is grabbed by the honey haired Miss
Winston and surrounded by other beauty queens to have his
picture taken. They hang all over hin.

DALAND
(to Harry)
Look at that. He’s actually shy.

HARRY
Oh, he’ll get over it.
EXT HIGHWAY (DAY) 115

: sprawled in the sitting room behind the cab, plucking lightly
on a banjo, drinking beer, whiskey and a little moonshine and
holding forth:

~ there was this coal mine I
a believed was gonna make me rich,

> could see was an assfull of money,
toe racing, charity, hell I proceeded
I, : to go up in the mountains and get

: loads of coal going up the
mountain, up that road. Dozens of
‘em. It shoulda dawned on me I
guess, but it didn’t. Now what
the hell are they doing hauling
coal up the mountain - the coal
is supposed to come down the .
mountain, don’t you see? crystal °
) clear, can’t miss it, but I did...

 

 

 

} Cole who is lying in a corner only half-listening has grown
increasingly attentive. He chuckles. As Harry keeps
I talking, Cole laughs harder.

HARRY
(going on)
~ these mountains had been worked
out for fifty years but they’d
. show guys like me truckloads of
\ : coal they’d supposedly loaded that
@ay, sell ‘em thousands of dollars
worth of useless mining stock,
1 move off and they’re never heard
be from again. They call that a dog
and pony show, I had to learn that
' the hard way -

' . Cole is laughing even harder.

! ' Harry breaks off. As far as he’s concerned Cole has become
an overappreciative audience. Harry goes over to Cole.

: HARRY
: ~ well it may be funny but it’s
| not that funny when it happens to
you -
Cole continues laughing.

COLE
, - it happened to me...

Harry’s dumbfounded. He sits.
     

*"Dec 19 1989 “46a.

. HARRY
~- what happened to you? You ‘
we : bought worthless mining stock?
COLE

(drinking a beer)
~ I told you I lost my ride?
That’s how I lost it. The team
owner was a con man..junk bonds,
worthless companies, but mainly he
sold stolen yachts. When I'd won
enough races he even used my name
to promote his sales. One day it
caught up with him, he went to
jail and I lost my ride - it was
pretty humiliating actually.

 

Harry’s affected by the story. He puts a hand on Cole’s
shoulder.

HARRY
Hell, Cole there’s no need to be
embarrassed by some low life piece
of trash who'd put you in that LN
kind of position. wy

COLE
I Well Harry, that depends.

Is HARRY
On what?
COLE
On whether or not you're related

to that low life piece of trash -
it was my father.

Cole laughs again.

Five, six years ago.

" ~ you lost your ride five or six
years ago?

Harry they don’t trust me, I don’t
trust them, you know how it goes ~
 

Dec 19 1989 47.

Harry nods, full of feeling. Cole can see Harry wants to say
something comforting.

COLE
For instance you lied to me
today. It was dumb luck I didn’t
end up crashed or dead. I oughta
“punch you out.

HARRY
~ give it a try.

COLE
No ~ I don’t want to get the shit
kicked out of me by a sixty year
old man -

That does it. Harry goes for Cole. ‘lhe two begin tussling.
Buck, a crew member, meanwhile is arm wrestling with a
gorgeous pit lizard, DARLENE, six feet, formed with great
tits, great ass'and anabolic steroids and getting the better
of Buck. Cole and Harry knock themselves to the floor -
they're like a pair of cubs, playing rough and where the
playing is going to end and the rough takes over neither one
knows. “

(out of breath)
Cole, we was settin’ in the money
spot, I wouldn't a wrecked you for

It’s a never never land out there,

' (reluctantly)
- hit the wall...

COLE

o why he hit it in the first place -
Nov 20 1989. 49.

Harry comes back in.

COLE
Buck says we were alike -

HARRY

{remembering fondly despite

himself)
- yeah, he’d push a car to the
edge knowing it could break loose
any minute and go ass over bandbox
and then he’d take it just a
little bit more -

He hands Cole the cherry moonshine.

DARLENE
- You ever think about crashin’,
Cole?

Harry watches Cole for his answer. Cole laughs.

COLE
- no. %
{the truth of this hits him)
- no, I don’t.

DARLENE
Well I do.

BUCK
(surprised)
When do you think about it?

DARLENE
Right now, Buck.

She’s got very little on an amazing bottom and the scantest
teshirt on top.

DARLENE
I’m bored -

- anybody wants to come and get
wrecked, I’1l be just around the

All right, everybody freeze.
You’re under arrest.

Harry with Cole staggers into the doorway.

HARRY
What the hell for?

HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER
It’s right there in your hand.
Transportation of illegal alcohol
across state lines for the purpose
of distribution -

HARRY
I don’t know what this looks like

~- is consumption...

He staggers.

That don’t exactly make it legal.

Up_ against the wall. Officers -

Other uniformed HP officers, two men and one woman move

The female officer promptly turns Cole back to the wall.

COLE
Where? just show me where.

FEMALE OFFICER
Right here -

With that she unzips Cole’s fly and uses what she finds as a
handle to turn him around.

FEMALE OFFICER
(facing a shocked Cole)
- now the only question is, will
he actually use it?

She tosses off her hat. Long blonde hair tumbles out. She
plants a big kiss on Cole, and everyone’s laughing. They’re
all in on the joke.

FEMALE OFFICER :
- please don’t be mad, Harry and
the boys thought you might like
me..

COLE
- Well, miss, as you know they’re
all a bunch of dumb, crude,
drunken louts, especially Harry -

The floodlights go on revealing Cole, dead drunk. His
Winston Cup trophy is precariously balanced on the edge of
the water well into which he’s dropping the cherries, one by

Tim in a bathrobe coming towards him.

Hell, yes, doedn’t everybody?

DALAND
(stepping again)
Well you just keep doin’ it and
we’ll find out.

COLE
- for how long? how long before
you find out if you’re really good
or really lucky?
 

Nov 20 1989. 54.

DALAND
(exasperated, laughing)
Cole that’s like my five year old
when she asks, ‘Daddy how long
before it’s morning?’

COLE
What do you tell her?

DALAND
Go to sleep!..

Daland walks out of the living room.

COLE
Hey Tim -

Daland pokes his head back in the doorway, annoyed despite
himself:

DALAND
- what?
COLE
How long before it’s morning?

Cole chuckles wickedly and plunks his head down on the
pillow. He’s asleep almost instantly. Daland remains in the
doorway, still smiling held by the afterglow of Cole’s
playfulness, amused but bemused as well by the troubling
questions.

FADE
ALDO BENEDETTI EXT. TRACK B 122

Goody’s Headache Powder’s hard luck hard charger, stands by
his race car. His expression is grave. He addresses camera:

ALDO
I keep hoping for a race that
doesn’t give me a headache, but as
leng as these guys are runnin’ =
First Rowdy in his racing suit walks by:

ROWDY
~ good luck today, Aldo -

ALDO
Thanks Rowdy -

Cole Trickle in his racing togs saunters by:

COLE
- good luck out there, Aldo -
Nov 20 1989. 55.

ALDO
Thanks Cole -
(to camera) ~
- the headaches keep comin’.

INT ALDO’S RACE CAR 123

Aldo screeches into a pit stop. The Gatorade cup flies in.
Aldo desperately tears open a couple of Goody’s Headache
packages off his dashboard - where dozens more are taped. He
downs the Goody’s and zooms out of the pit.

IMPISH VOICE OVER
“Goody’s" for those headaches that
just won’t quit -

This last over two quick cuts - one of Rowdy, the other of
Cole tearing down the track and passing Aldo whose car is
stopped once again - as he’s getting a traffic ticket.

BACK TO:
EXT RACE TRACK (DAYTONA) DAY i: 124

BOB JENKINS V.O.
- you’re looking at the number 46
car of Cole Trickle who’s leading
here at the Firecracker 400 in
Daytona, Florida - that Superflo
Chevy Lumina running out front is
an increasingly familiar sight,
isn't it Ned Jarrett?

NED JARRETT V.O.
- yes indeed, Bob Jenkins, since
his Pocono victory, Trickle has
gone on to win at Michigan, at
Watkins Glen, and how he’s one car
away from lapping the entire field
146 laps into the race -

BENNY PARSONS V.O.
Lately he’s been a headache for
Aldo Benedetti and about 39
other drivers -

During Jarrett’s V.0. coverage include insert ESPN bites in
all four corners of the screen - Cole winning Pocono, Cole
winning Michigan, Cole winning Watkins Glen and in the fourth
corner Cole in victory lane being interviewed, radiating
confidence and poise ~ "our Superflo/Chevy Lumina did
everything we asked out there" - since the night on Daland’s
sofa Cole has become a risen star, on the way to being larger
than life.
 

Nov 20 1989. 56.

~ TRACK 125

BENNY PARSONS V.O.
- right now he’s giving Rowdy
Burns more than a headache -

 

NED JARRETT V.O.
He‘s liable to get more than a
headache from Rowdy if they keep
this up -

This exchange because Cole has come up behind Burns who goes
high and low to keep Cole from passing. Cole’s response is a
nudge on Rowdy’s bumper. As they slam and bam back and forth
and bother the cars around them:

NED JARRETT V.O.
- these sorts of rivalries, while
they may be fun for the fans, are
always dangerous - not only to
themselves but to the other
drivers -

Inserts of Cole and Rowdy in the corner of the screen - Rowdy
responding to Nascar warnings that he and Cole have caused
other drivers to crash and Cole denying that he’s racing
anyone in particular - ‘you worry about one guy, you turn
your back on the rest of ‘em, and you can’t afford to do
that -’.

BENNY PARSONS V.O.
Well he says it but does he mean
it?
ON THE TRACK COLE - TRACK 126
nudges Rowdy’s bumper again, and loosens it.
INT ROWDY’S CAR 127

At 170 miles an hour he can hear the bumper rattling. He
swears.

INT COLE’S CAR 128

HARRY’S VOICE
(on radio}
- stop messin’ with him, he’s
not gonna give to you -

COLE
- c’mon, just one more tap -
And he does it. Rowdy’s bumper really rattles.
ROWDY - INT. ROWDY 129

is practically foaming with fury.
Nov 20 1989. S7.

WADDELL
(on radio)
- that bumper gets any looser,
Rowdy and they’re gonna black flag
you - let him go by -

~ TRACK 130
Rowdy signals to Cole to let him pass. Cole moves to the
outside on the turn and Rowdy really slams him. Cole loses
his rear end.

Cole spins, smoking, and looks like he’s going right into the
wall - but does a perfect 360 and barely scrapes it - he
keeps on going and passes Rowdy.

The crowd goes wild. Rowdy is furious.
INT CAR - INT. COLE 131

COLE
I don’t know what you were so
worried about, Harry -

AT THE PIT HARRY . 132

with Daland looks like he’s nearly had a coronary. But both
men look up to see Cole pass by and wave, obviously in
complete control. They look at one another and shake their
heads.

BENNY PARSONS V.0.
- well Ned Jarrett, that boy knows
something about race cars I sure
don’t -

A FAN - GRANDSTAND 133

twists the cap off a beer bottle and tosses it. It rolls
through the fencing and onto the track at turn four.

- TRACK 134
Cole’s car comes into the turn at over 180 miles an hour -
hits the bottle cap. His right front tire is punctured.

In a flash Cole caroms off one car, gets sideways, and then
backwards which sends him airborne at least fifteen to twenty
feet over the track. He comes crashing down into and along
the wall end over end at first and then endless barrel
rolling, a whirling dervish of smoke and flames with
exploding pieces of machinery spewing out. It looks as if
nothing will be left of the car when the smoke clears. And
when it does, it reaveals little more than the roll cage.

CLOSE COLE - INT. COLE 135

He stirs, swears and starts to answer Harry’s frantic radio
call. Then he looks up. .
     

Nov 20 1989. 58.

HIS POV - TRACK 136

Coming down the track toward him at 180 miles an hour, the
cars are three a breast. There’s no way they can all avoid
him.

ONE CAR - TRACK 137

T-bones him brutally - sending him down the track, smoking
and crumpled into the infield.

INT. ROWDY 138
Other cars meanwhile have piled up and wrecked - Rowdy
avoided Cole but hit the car Cole caromed off - lost his
bumper, causing cars behind him to lose control, rear end
him and send him into the wall where he now hangs upside
down over a guard rail. His helmet is off his head and he’s
badly bruised.

WADDELL’S VOICE
(on radio)
- pit and get four tires! pit and
get four tires! %

ROWDY
(into radio)
Waddell, I’m hanging upside down
and they’re gonna have to cut me
out of this race car. Now what in
the fuck are you talking about?

- TRACK 139
Harry and Daland rush toward the infield where Cole’s car is
a smoking ruin.

HARRY
(into radio as they’re going)
Cole, can you hear me? do you
copy? can you say something?

COLE’S VOICE
(on radio)
- let me catch my breath, okay?..I
feel like I’m in one piece, but
I’m really not sure -

HARRY
(stopping, with Daland)
What do you mean you’re not sure?-

COLE’S VOICE
Well, I can’t see anything -
(a funny laugh)
- I’m blind...I feel okay, Harry
but I’m blind -

Harry and Daland take off on a dead run.
Jan 23 1990, " 59.

IN ESPN TRUCK

The camera crew is going crazy with their video banks, from a
replay of the crash, to isolated shots of Rowdy’s crash, to
isolated shots of Cole’s crash, to crew reactions like
Harry’s and Daland’s, to the inboard POV shot looking over
Cole’s shoulder as the car dips, hits another car, spins,
gets airborne - and then on crashing into the wall, loses
picture.

OMIT (141)
INT EMERGENCY ROOM (MOVING)

Cole, wheeled along in aa gurney, is swooped down on by
nurses and doctors that make him seem like the object of a
feeding frenzy.

COLE
- could you wait, could you wait,
could you tell me what’s going on,
I can’t see -

They’re using scissors to cut away his uniform working up
from the ankles and the wrists, putting leads on his chest,
getting a cardiac monitor going, clamps on his finger for a
pulse oximeter, oxygen mask, etc. Cole starts to struggle
against the attention he can’t see.

ROWDY

a serious bruise on his forehead, is the object of similar
attention. He watches himself being hooked up to monitoring
systems:

ROWDY
~ I‘m not a car battery, I don’t
need rechargin’ -

YOUNG DOCTOR
- this is standard procedure -

ROWDY
- go fuck yourself -

DR. CLAIRE LEWICKI, a young woman in surgical. greens, bends
over Rowdy.

DR. LEWICKI
- what was that, Mr. Burns?

She checks out the bruise on his forehead. Rowdy checks her
out.

thrasing around now, panicked. His legs are taped to the
table, sandbags on either side of his head.

COLE
~ Ifm blind, godammit somebody’s
gotta tell me what’s going on!

He manages to tear himself half off the table. Dr. Lewicki
into SHOT. She puts her arm around his shoulder.

Okay, okay, what’s your name?

INT CAT-SCAN COLE 143

in lead-lined room, Dr. Lewicki speaking to him from the
outside as he’s being readied for the MRI scan.

DR. LEWICKI
You've had a concussion, your
brain is bruised and like any
bruise it’s going to swell. That
swelling is almost certainly
what’s affecting your vision.

COLE
You mean this’1ll go away?

DR. LEWICKI -
- if that’s the problem, now we’re
going to run some tests.

COLE
- what kind of tests?

DR. LEWICKI
- I just need to confirm what’s
going on, I never pass up the
opportunity to see if a good
looking man has a brain in his
head -

She continues preparatiens te run the MRI.

COLE

You’re a brain doctor?
DR. LEWICKI

- yes -
COLE

A good one?

DR. LEWICKI
{she smiles)
- so-so.

Cole is obviously frightened.

COLE
Look, when I’m driving I got a guy
who talks to me on the radio - I
can’t see him but he talks to me -

Cole has made a dent in her professional demeanor and Claire
is touched.
DR. LEWICKI
T/ll talk to you -

The machine whirrs and a section of Cole’s brain is projected
on the screen.

CLOSE COLE

His eyes open.

Grainy movement of gray and blacks, like a negative being

formed. He can see shapes in the room. Then the color

bleeds in.

INT NEURO INTENSIVE CARE (DAY) 144

Cole is looking at Harry, who is crumpled up in a chair,
dozing, his spit cup in hand.

COLE
Harry you okay?
HARRY
(with a start)
Yeah, why?
Now his eyes open. He watches Cole hopefully.
COLE

You look all bent outta shape. Oh
hell, it’s probably my eyes -

He scurries out.

smiles when he sees the crew coming in.

BUCK
Damn nice to see you, Cole -

COLE
Damn nice to see you, Buck -

A moment later Harry enters with Dr. Lewicki. She’s out of
surgical greens and in a white smock over street clothes.
Her appearance is dramatic. She’s young, she’s tall, and
she’s striking.

HARRY
- you've met Dr. Lewicki, Cole -

Cole stares back without saying a word.

HARRY
- your doctor, Dr. Lewicki -

DR. LEWICKI
(to Harry, pleasantly)
- I don’t think he’s actually seen
me -

COLE
(to Harry)
Oh, sure, Harry, Dr. Lewicki -
hi, doctor, how are you?

Claire Lewicki smiles - walks across the room to greet Cole.

HARRY
(suddenly)
- no Cole, this really is Dr.
Lewicki -
   

“Nov 20 1989. : 63.

COLE
- absolutely ~

DR. LEWICKI
- I was just about to go off

DR. LEWICKI
Well that’s not a bad idea. You
feel your vision’s restored?

HARRY
(vainly)
- Cole -
COLE

- Oh I think so -

She pulls out an opthalmoscope.

COLE
What’re you going to do with that?

DR. LEWICKI
~ look into your eyes -

5 COLE
Now doctor, isn’t this what you're
really looking for?

Cole takes Lewicki’s hand and puts it under the covers, right
ever his crotch. Harry about faints. Lewicki’s spins
stiffens slightly. She keeps her hand on Cole’s crotch,
however. It’s almost as though she is listening to it with a
stethoscope:

DR. LEWICKI
Well it seems interesting enough
Mr. Trickle, but it’s just not my
specialty -

She withdraws her hand and walks out of the room just as
Daland enters. A moment of stunned silence.

COLE
- she’s the real thing?

smile - :

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (MOVING) 147

Rowdy Burns in civilian clothes and a wheelchair is pushed
briskly along by a no-nonsense nurse, preferably with a voice
like Eugene Palette’s.

ROWDY
(furiously)
- I can walk, godammit!

NURSE
Not as long as you’re in this
hospital you can’t -

They’re nearly blindsided by Cole - also in civilian clothes
and also pissed about being in a wheelchair. His Latino
orderly has nearly banged him into Rowdy. The two drivers
glare at one another, then continue down the corridor
wheelchair to wheelchair in an unintentional reprise of their
car race.

COLE
(whispering to his orderly)
- I don’t wanna be next to this
clown, couid you pick up the pace
a little?..

ORDERLY
{in heavily accented Spanish)
If you wan’ drugs you gotta see
the nurse, buddy -

Cole swears. He grabs onto the wheels and whips them
forward. Rowdy takes only a moment to react. He too picks
up the pace staying even with Cole. The orderly and the
gravelly nurse hasten to stay up with the escalating pace.
The two nearly run into Dr. Lewicki. She’s waiting outside a
main floor conference room with Harry nearby.

DR. LEWICKI
Good morning, gentlemen. Right
this way -

INT CONFERENCE ROOM 148

Several Nascar officials listen intently. Dr. Lewicki is
running tape of the computer generated CAT-scan. Like two
recalcitrant children Cole and Rowdy sit in their wheelchairs
watching, along with Harry, Daland and Waddell (Rowdy’s crew
chief).
Nov 20 1989.

DR. LEWICKI
- neither Mr. Burns nor in this
case Mr. Trickle present any
significant intracranial injury -

LEN DORTORT, an imposing official:

DORTORT
Hold it, doc let’s have that one
in English. Did they mess up
their squash or not?

DR. LEWICKI
Their brains are intact,
(a glance at Cole)
as much as they were before the
accident anyway.

DORTORT
You’re willing to give em
clearance to get back on a race
track.

DR. LEWICKI
- well, I, that’s obviously a
dangerous way to spend your time -

DORTORT
- that’s a philosophical
objection, Doc. I’m lookin’ for a
medical one. In you professional
epinion is there any reason these
two men should not be allowed to
return to racing?

Now Rowdy and Cole are hanging on Dr. Lewicki’s tiniest
gesture and she sees it.

DR. LEWICKI
(uncomfortable)
- all the follow up scans have
been negative, but no one of
course can give you guarantees -

DORTORT
- young lady, we know you’re an
accomplished physician - did you
happen to see these boys crash?

DR. LEWICKI
Ifve never seen a race. I am,
however, familiar with car
crashes.

DORTORT
At 180 miles an hour? We can show
it to you. Banjo -

  
    

Nov 20 1989. 66.

One of the NASCAR officials pulls out a tape of his own. He
starts to put it in the VCR:

ROWDY
- I ain’t lookin’ at that
sumbitch.

DR. LEWICKI
It isn’t necessary. I’m not
inclined to give them clearance at
this time.

Both Rowdy and Cole start to protest.

DORTORT
Gentlemen, please - what would
you suggest then?

DR. LEWICKI
A re-evaluation in another week or
two.

Again they start to protest. ™

DORTORT
Thank you, doc - now we have a
little something to say to the
boys here. I don’t think you
necessarily need to hear it ~-

She leaves. Rowdy and Cole look hatefully at one another.

DORTORT
Okay, it’s Big John’s turn.

BIG JOHN ENGLISH rises out of his chair and suddenly fills
the room. It’s as though he sprouted out of the floor. He
towers over the two drivers in their wheelchairs.

BIG JOHN
- if you wanna turn yourselves
into a greasy spot on a country
road somewheres, go right ahead, I
don’t give a shit and I don’t
think anybody else does no matter
what they say to your face - but
you two monkeys are not gonna do
it on my racetrack!.. Now y’all
heard about Japanese inspection?
Japanese inspection. Nobody here
know about Japanese inspection?
Well I’1l1 tell you about it. When
the Japs get a load of lettuce
they’re not so sure they want in
the country, why they just let it
set on the docks until they’re
good and ready to look at it.

(MORE)
~ —————

Nov 20 1989. 67.

BIG JOHN (cont’d)
By that time it’s all gone rotten
and there ain’t nothin’ left to
inspect. In other words - lettuce
is a perishable item, like you
two monkeys. You trade paint one
more time, you so much as touch,
I’ll black flag the two of you and
take apart your race cars for the
next three hundred laps. Then,
if you pass inspection and put
your car back together, maybe I’11
let you finish the race - now to
show us there’s no hard feelin’s,
we’re all going out to dinner
together -

COLE
I got other plans.

ROWDY
Yeah, so do I.

BIG JOHN *
You’1ll have to change em. Not
only that, you two’ll drive to
dinner together.

He drops car keys on the table between them.
INT HOSPITAL ROOM 149

a large closet off the corridor - coffee bar, coke machine,
formica and cremora. Dr. Lewicki is having coffee and
chatting with a good looking male colleague.

HARRY
Dr. Lewicki, I want to apologize
for what happened with Cole when
you come into the hospital room.

Lewicki and the male doctor exchange glances. He discreetly
drifts on out.

DR. LEWICKTI
{graciously)
Mr. Hogge, please, it’s nothing to
worry about and in any case it was
hardly your doing.

HARRY
{a cough)
- that’s just it. I believe it

was.

Dr. Lewicki looks puzzled. Harry gets very red in the face.
Then:
 

Nov 20 1989. 68.

HARRY
- not too long ago after he won
Pecono we played a trick on Cole,
dressed up a pretty girl ina
highway patrol uniform...anyway we
told her to get real ornery with
him and - she did.

DR. LEWICKI
By ornery you mean...

HARRY
(deeply embarrassed)
- real ornery.

DR. LEWICKI
Why would you want me to know
about this?

HARRY
I don’t want you to hold a bad
opinion of Cole..I believe it
scares him -
(a long pause)
- you're his doctor. ‘

And Claire Lewicki sees Harry doesn’t want his race car
driver scared.

EXT HOSPITAL PARKING LOT (DAY) REAR ANGLE GREEN CHEVROLET 150

with its Florida license plate surrounded by a BUDGET RENT-A-~
CAR frame. Cole into SHOT. He tries one of the car doors.
It’s locked. He leans up against the car, waiting, eyes
nearly closed. For the first time there’s a sense of
exhaustion and aftershock from the crash. Some image
nevertheless makes an impression. He takes off.

DR. LEWICKI

is walking down a hospital ramp toward the parking lot,
briefcase and car keys in hand. As she turns into the lot
she sees Cole sprinting toward her. She stops.

COLE
Doctor!

DR. LEWICKI
- I heard you thought I was a
highway patrol officer.

It’s clearly a surprise to Cole that she knows about it.
It’s mixed relief.

COLE
- I also wanted to thank you for
taking care of me.
          

Nov 20 1989. , 69.

DR. LEWICKI
(pleasantly)
That’s my job.

COLE
Yeah, well it’s my life.

Cole looks like he’1l stand there all day. He either doesn’t
want to move away from her or doesn’t know how to. Finally:

DR. LEWICKI
(gently teasing)
Well this time, let’s shake
hands..
She extends hers. Cole nearly jumps.

COLE
of course,

DR. LEWICKI
Good luck, Cole.

She turns away.

COLE
Dr. Lewicki!

She turns back.

COLE
Could I see you?

DR. LEWICKI
Oh you will, I promise.

COLE
No I mean would you have dinner
with me? catch a movie or -

DR. LEWICKI
oh, that’s very sweet, really -
but it’s not going to get you back
on the track any faster.

COLE
No, it’s not that -

She waves brightly, smiles crisply and turns away. Her back
is not to be argued with and Cole sees it. Then something
else catches his eye.

ROWDY

is walking toward the green Chevrolet.

COLE

now turns and walks toward the green Chevrolet.
     

Nov 20 1989. 70.

FULL SHOT

It’s a little like a gunfighter’s shootout. Each step brings
them closer to one another - until only the car’s roof
separates them. Rowdy has reached the driver’s side, Cole
the passenger side.

ROWDY
Now here’s how I see this deal.
You ain‘’t gonna want me to drive
to dinner and I ain’t gonna want
you to driver to dinner so there’s
only one way to settle this..

He looks down at the car’s key chain and smiles again. He
fingers the tag. It too says BUDGET RENT-A-CAR. Now Cole
smiles.

EXT BUDGET RENT-A-CAR OFFICE (DAY) idl

The green Chevrolet is parked out front - next to an almost
identical blue one. Cole and Rowdy exit the car office each
carrying a set of keys. A pleasant matronish woman follows.

COLE
Oh yes mam. We sure will.

Cole gets into the blue Chevrolet. Rowdy gets into the green
Chevrolet. Cole leans out the window.

returning from work walks up the stairs to her apartment
overlooking the bay. She opens the door and gapes.

attention -

INT LEWICKI’S APARTMENT 165

with Claire on the phone, in a room absolutely filled with
lush flowers and brightly colored balloons, a couple of which
are attached to a large toy kangaroo dressed in a white smock
wearing a stethoscope.

CLAIRE
(laughing herself)
- well you got it. I’ve walked
into a jungle!..no it’s nicely
extravagant, but really I can’t
I’m a doctor -

COLE
- and I’m a patient. You have to
re-examine Rowdy and me to clear
us. Come up here and do it. Take
you to a race -

CLAIRE
~ come on! I don’t want to watch
you fellas go round and round in
those noisy things chasing each
other like a pack of dogs on my

COLE
- well how about chasing me on

resident. I’m on call 24 hours.

COLE
Okay, doctor, let’s suppose you
had a couple of days with nothing
else to do, could I interest you
in the North Carolina countryside?

There’s a long pause.

the field doctor.

Cole jogs back from a couple of drivers.

COLE
Rowdy’s not here -

FIELD DOCTOR
(checking his watch)
- I told him to meet us at the

CLAIRE .
Well, we should probably go ahead

clearance?
INT EXAMINING ROOM (DAY) 170

Claire places a smock on the table.

CLAIRE
Put this on.

COLE
~- right.

She leaves. He picks up the smock and it seems to fall
apart - it’s one of those tissue thin paper jobs with the
embarrassing split down the back.

CLOSE MERCURY COLUMN

on blood pressure gauge. The column is pumped higher and
higher.

COLE
is sitting bare legged on the table in his smock.
CLAIRE
- if this were your normal blood
pressure, you’d have dropped dead
twenty years ago, relax will you?

She stands between his legs while he remains seated on the
table. She holds her hands out to either side.
 

Nov 20 1989. 77.

CLAIRE
- now look at my nose and tell me
which finger’s moving ~

COLE
- little finger, index finger,
both fingers -

Her face is maddeningly close. Cole is having a hard time.
He starts to drift closer to her. Claire extends two fingers
on-her right hand:

CLAIRE
Squeeze.

Cole squeezes. She extends two fingers on her left hand.

CLAIRE
Squeeze.

He squeezes.
CLAIRE USES THE REFLEX HAMMER

on Cole’s knees, arms, ankles. He watches her tap by tap,
reflex by reflex, as she methodically goes over his body.
He’s beginning to perspire. Claire’s manner, if anything,
seems more detached, more clinical. It begins to annoy Cole.

SERIES OF SHOTS

Cole stands before Claire and touches his nose with his left
hand. She touches her nose with her right hand. He touches
his nose with his right hand. The exam becomes - a Kabuki
dance, semaphore signalling, courtship dance, children
Playing Simon says.

CLAIRE (& CLAIRE’S VOICE)
Hands out - clpse your eyes -
palms up - open your eyes - follow
my finger - stand with your feet
together and close your eyes, walk
with one foot in front of the
other - back on the table -

COLE
Back on the table?

CLAIRE
Yes, back on the table -

Cole's anger is growing. He gets back on the table.

COLE
This is tough -

CLAIRE
Examinations always are -
Nov 20 1989. 78.

COLE
Why is that?

CLAIRE
I’m looking you over and I might
not like what I see, that has to
worry you -

She turns off the light in the room, switches on the
opthalmoscope. The white pinpoint flits around the room.

CLAIRE
Pick a spot on the wall and look
at it.
Cole does. Claire moves to him in the darkened room until
they’re literally eye to eye. She looks through the
opthalmoscope.
CLAIRE
(a little testy)
Please don’t move!

COLE
I didn’t move.

CLAIRE
- your eyes - just focus on one
spot.
She looks again.

COLE
What do you see?

CLAIRE
~- the retina -

ECU RETINA
and its lush network of arteries and veins.

COLE'S VOICE
What’s it look like?

CLAIRE
~- pink, pulsating, very pretty
actually -
TWO SHOT CLAIRE AND COLE
Their faces move inches apart.

COLE
Seen enough?

CLAIRE
Just about.
Nov 20 1989. 79.

She takes a part of the opthalmoscope and runs it across the
bottem of Cole’s foot. Cole jumps.

COLE

What’d you do that for?
CLAIRE

~ thought you might like it,

it’s -

Cole grabs Claire and kisses her. She doesn’t move and
doesn’t respond. Cole releases her.

CLAIRE
(going on)
- the Babinsky sign -

She runs the opthalmoscope over the bottom of his foot again.
His toe automatically points down.

CLAIRE
- if the toe goes up, you’re in
trouble - you’re fine. Put on
your clothes -

She turns on the wall switch and goes out the door. Cole
sags, shakes his head. He does not look fine.

EXT HALLWAY 171

Claire leans against the wall, waiting. It’s grown darker
and quieter. Cole emerges. They walk side by side down the
hall, Cole ashen:

COLE
~ look I’m sorry, it drove me nuts
in there. How could you ignore me
like that?

They round the corner. She turns to Cole and pins him
against the wall. She kisses him every bit as forcefully as
he'd kissed her. Cole is shocked. The two of them slide
down the wall to the floor.

CLAIRE
- I wasn’t ignoring you.. I gave
you a very thorough physical -
After a moment the two kiss again - very slowly.
CLAIRE’S LEG - INT. HOTEL ROOM 172

long and shapely lies on top of the covers. A neat row of
‘Sweet & Low’ packs line her leg above and below the knee.

COLE’S VOICE
~ they did scientific studies on
this - :
Nov 20 1989, 80.

CLAIRE
(laughing)
On what?

INT HOTEL ROOM (MORNING) 173

Claire herself lies under the covers sipping coffee, room
service tray and morning papers nearby. Cole in a towel sits
cross-legged on the bed hovering over Claire’s exposed leg.

COLE
Drafting -

He moves the ‘Sweet & Low’ packs as cars up her leg:

COLE
- when one car tucks in behind
another two cars go faster than
one can by itself. What they do
is divide the air resistance .
between them, now here is where it
gets complicated...
(he moves a ‘Sweet & Low’
pack higher on her thigh)
- the lead car has to floor it to
hit 200 miles an hour, but the car
tucked in behind -
(takes the second pack
placing it right behind the
first)
~ doesn’t. It can go just as fast
and still have power in reserve so
when these two cars come off the
last turn -
(moving packs still higher on
her thigh)
- the car in back can move out
of the draft and beat the lead car
to the finish line...

The ‘Sweet & Low’ pack is brought up short by the sheet which
covers that point where Claire’s thigh meets her groin. She
thoughtfully regards the racing manoeuvers on her leg.

CLAIRE
»..very interesting...

She suddenly bends her leg at the knee. The ‘Sweet & Low’
packs go flying. The gesture and her breathtaking leg have
the impact of a multi-car crash on Cole. Staring at her leg:

COLE
- I’m never gonna live long
enough -
(he jumps on Claire, kissing
her)

- to do this enough -
       

Nov 20 1989. . 81.

CLAIRE
~ is there anything else you ever
wanted to do besides race?

This momentarily puzzles Cole.

COLE
- wouldn’t know. I left school
when I was 16. I found out [I
could make a living at racing
about the same time I found out I
had to make a living -

CLAIRE
- maybe you cught to go back to
school -
(Cole gives her a look)
- wellit is dangerous and you’re
just running around in circles.
(Cole laughs)
- what do you love so much about
it?
A long moment. Then very softly:
COLE
~ the speed..I want to control it,
I want to know it’s not just dumb
luck. I want to know that I can
control something that, that’s..

CLAIRE
- out of control.

With a sigh of relief.

COLE
- yeah. How’d you know?

Claire continues to regard Cole warily.

EXT COUNTRYSIDE (DAY) 174
Cole with Claire hanging onto his waist tools down the road

on his motorcycle. He’s moving at a leisurely pace, there

are meadows and woods and pastures, picturesque barns and

little towns that pass in the blink of an eye.

Cole turns off the road and into a hollow. Disappears.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOLLOW - EXT. LAKE HOUSE 175
men are at work baling hay. One of them turns and scowls

when he hears the motorcycle. It is Rowdy. The scowl
disappears. What replaces it almost passes for a smile.

Cole and Claire ride into SHOT.

Rowdy helps Claire off the bike.
 

Nov 20 1989.

ROWDY
I’m surprised at a sensible gal
like you Dec, this guy can’t
hardly drive to dinner without
crashin’ everything on the road -

CLAIRE
What’s he talking about?

Cole glares at Rowdy.

ROWDY
(backtracking hastily)
- naa, just seems every time we
get around each other he runs into
somethin’ - he’s done it at least
eight times in ten races -

COLE
Claire - you gotta know he’s
lying. The man can’t count past
five.

ROWDY
Y¥’all got a few minutes? I/11
show you around.

CLAIRE
(as they’re walking)
- we're here to see you - this is
a house call, you didn’t show up
for your physical -

This brings Rowdy up short.

ROWDY
Damn, I forgot.

COLE
You forgot?

ROWDY
You worried about me?

CLAIRE
Of course he is.

Rowdy laughs.

ROWDY
Now doc, if you didn’t look the
way you do, I’d swear Cole got
you up here just to make sure he
gets back in his race car before
that new driver, Russ Wheeler,
takes it away from him -

Cole holds up his thumb.

Jump and I’11 catch you, buddy.

ROWDY
He did run good the other day, you
gotta admit - Come on there’s
Loretta and the kids, you can help
em feed the fish. We got piranhas
down there -

CLAIRE
- sure you do -

Rowdy points at a pond beneath where a young woman holding a

baby waves.

As they walk down the hill:

ROWDY

Funny thing about that Cole, I
grew up and I hated farming, all I
wanted was to work on race cars,
then I got to racin’ - run into
Loretta -

(who hugs him)
- and now what I want is to. make *
enough money so I can work on a
farm!

CLAIRE
{to Loretta)
Very nice to meet you.

LORETTA
Nice to meet you, howdy Cole -

The older children are feeding the fish, background. Rowdy
checks out his baby, kissing it and making noises. Claire is
near the edge of the pond.

ROWDY
- don’t get within a foot of the
water, doc, them piranha can get
out, jump up on the bank -

LORETTA
{to Claire)
- them’re catfish -

ROWDY
~ I seen ’em drag a goat in one
day -

LORETTA

ROWDY
Hey you oughta see them birds come
flyin’ in the lake trying to catch
fish, first thing you know they’re
short legged -

 

 
 

Nov 20 1989. 84.

LORETTA
Rowdy!

Rowdy laughs, as does everyone else. Claire throws her arm
around Cole’s waist. The two couples amble along the pond
side by side. Catfish skitter in the water. The sun throws
lengthening shadows on the meadow. Cricket sounds are in the
air.

CLAIRE

_. (very happy)
- it is beautiful -

There’s a splash. Claire and Cole look to see Rowdy has
actually tripped and nearly fallen into the pond.

ROWDY
{a little sheepish)
- sorry honey, if I’m not ona
racetrack I don’t always pay
attention to where I’m goin’ -

LORETTA
Well, Rowdy, it’s easier ona
racetrack, all you gotta do is
keep turnin’ left.

EXT LAKE NORMAN (DAY) 176

Rowdy’s kids skim and buck across the water on sea dcoo’s
(they look like sea-going motorcycles), racin’ and runnin’
around in circles.

Rowdy meanwhile propels his sleek scarab across the lake at
seventy miles an hour - with Claire, Loretta, and Cole on
board. They pass other speeding boats and water-skiers.
Claire says something to Rowdy.

ROWDY
(above the engine roar)
~ yep one way or another, we’re
always chasin’ after speed -

EXT LAKE (TWILIGHT) 177

Mists are beginning to rise. Rowdy is puttering along,
barely above an idle as he points out places along the
shoreline:

ROWDY
- that there’s our home on the
lake, just beyond, top of that
knoll we’re gonna build our
permanent home. [I got an option
on eight more acres that‘ll block
it off from the highway -

COLE
- cost much to build up there?
    

Jan 4 1990 “85.

ROWDY
About ten million dollars,
Loretta‘s doin’ the buildin’ -

As usual he’s teasing. Then, proudly:

ROWDY
~ she’s designin’ the house.

LORETTA
We just want a place where no
one’s ever lived but us, idn’t
that right -

She breaks off when she sees Rowdy’s face. He's suddenly
pale and clammy and his eyelids are fluttering. He presses

his hands to his temples, like he’s trying to squash his
head.

LORETTA
- baby, what is it?

ROWDY
(reeling)
- think I’m seasick -

LORETTA
Rowdy you never been seasick in
your life -

Rowdy passes out. His head hits the gunwhale before Loretta
can catch him.

Rowdy smirks and shrugs, a gesture both defiant and
pathetic.

reprise of his own examination, appalled.

Rowdy promptly topples to his left. Claire catches him.
Rowdy’s tongue is protruding, a little saliva runs down
his chin. As he straightens up and wipes away the saliva,
his hands are trembling:

assessment. Bill Wilhaire,

Cole turns back te the set and flips the channel, leaving
Harry more than a little surprised. He waits for more but
Cole is glued to the set. He’s flipped to a Barbary Coast
movie, set in a lush gambling establishment. The croupier at
a roulette wheel urges everyone to place their bets, then
spins the white ball. It goes round and round in its groove
on the slowly spinning wheel like a car around a track. Cole

HARRY

(whispering)
- it’s like I tele you on the
Phone, Cole’s no different from
these other guys. They don’t like
to be reminded what can happen to
‘em in a race car.

(quietly pointing)
- see that fellow? His daddy
Buddy Bretherton was the king of
stock cars. Hero to these
drivers. He was also the only
driver at his funeral. You get a
driver to a funeral before he’s
actually dead and you’ve made
history, doc =<

CLAIRE
- we’re not talking about a
funeral, if anything we/re talking
about preventing one -

Cole has spotted Claire as the meeting breaks up. He hurries
over and is so happy to see her he doesn’t quite know what to
do.

CLAIRE
Is it bad luck to kiss somebody
before a race?

HARRY
(regretfully)
~ yeah it is, I better handle
this, Cole -

Harry starts to put his arms around Claire. Cole grabs

Claire and plants a big kiss on her as Harry cackles and
other passing drivers shout cheers of encouragement and

approval.

Wheeler meanwhile sees that Cole is suddenly relaxed. He’s
not thrilled.

CLAIRE
(to both men)
- this is my first race.

COLE
We'll make it a good one.

to have that Superflo Chevy

today and not just Russ Wheeler,
it does make a difference -

EXT PIT ROAD 195

Cole ducks into pit road. Wheeler squeezes in behind him.

In that no-man’s land between the track and the road Wheeler
bumps Cole.

EXT PIT AREA HARRY 198
has reacted to the bumping. Claire watches.

Cole’s pit and Wheeler’s pit are adjacent, with Wheeler’s in
front of Cole’s. When Cole jets in, Wheeler pulls up in

front and deliberately parks wide.

When Cole tries to leave the pit his exit is blocked by the
bumper of Wheeler’s car still being serviced. In a fury Cole

has to back up but in that half-second Wheeler pulls out in

front of Cole as do two other drivers. Buck is beside
himself.

BUCK
(in his own heavy Southern
accent)
- that no account red neck son-of-

a-bitch -

Harry glares across the pits at Daland who is with Wheeler’s
crew, Daland looks sheepish and shrugs as if to say it was
an accident.

ON THE RACE TRACK

Cole is now running fifth position, behind Wheeler and
others.

coming out fifth with 6 laps to
go -

EXT TRACK ss 199

Cole threads his way back through traffic, going high on the
outside of Rudd, nearly scraping the wall, then diving down
on the inside pinching by Wallace and Wheeler who was in
third position. He draws virtually even with the leader.

Claire’s not altogether reassured.

has found the flapping goggles to his huge relief. He’s
about to say something when he sees Wheeler very large in his
rear view mirror.

Wheeler barely touches Cole’s bumper on the last. turn.

Cole reacts, jerks the wheel too sharply, and spins. He goes
into the wall and comes off it with two flat tires - just a
couple of hundred yards from the finish.

NED JARRETT
- what a shame -

BENNY PARSONS V.0.
- didn’t seem like there was much
contact, Ned - |

NED JARRETT
- well sometimes it doesn’t take
that much, Benny.

EXT PIT ROAD 204

Claire watches Harry as he’s leapt into the adjacent pit and
is nose to nose with Daland:

win Tim, and if Nascar won’t call
it low down, shit-ass racin’, you

DALAND
(eyeing the two hostile crews
nervously)
- it was just racin’, Harry. Cole
overreacted ~

COLE
Change my tires.

- what for? The race is over,

The crew changes Cole’s tires. He zooms back on the track.
Claire watches, puzzled.

turn from each other, stare at the wreck. As it dawns on
him:

DALAND .
He’s..destroyed..both..my..cars!

HARRY
You done that, you greedy used

That does it. Fist fights between the two crews break out.
Harry and Daland get knocked to the ground.

As they’re lying side by side, trying to keep from getting
pummelled:

opens the door for Claire.

Well, thanks for coming -

Where are you going from here?

COLE
Drop the rent-a-car off, catch the
flight to Charlotte -

He shrugs helplessly.

CLAIRE
Would you..like me to come with

Cole is surprised. It momentarily conceals his pleasure.

A cab pulls up
him.

behind them. Honks. Claire moves close to

CLAIRE
We could call this a medical
emergency.

COLE
(a trifle defensive)
- it’s not. I mean there’s
nothin’ wrong with me...

The cab honks again.

This brings up

CLAIRE
(softly)
We could also..try to see Rowdy.

Cole sharply.

COLE
Oh. Yeah.

CLAIRE
Anything wrong with that?

COLE
Of course not. I guess I’d
forgotten about that.

(unavoidably pointed)
I know.

COLE
(irritated)
So it’s a medical emergency after
all. Why didn’t you just say so?

The cab honks three times. Without looking back Cole flips
the cab driver the finger. The cab driver responds by giving
Cole’s rear bumper a tap. It is a replay of Wheeler’s tap,
and Cole flies into a rage. He jams the car into reverse and
slams into the cab.

CLAIRE
Cole!..

Before she can say anything Cole has rammed the car into
forward, screeches ahead ten yards and jams it back into
reverse. The cab driver’s eyes pop open. he sees it coming
and peels out into traffic before Cole can hit him again.
Cole takes off after him, Claire having a hard time closing

her door. ‘

CLAIRE
Let me out of this car, Cole...
(Cole doesn’t answer)
- let me out of the car. Let me
out or I’m getting out -

Cole clips the suitcase of some poor guy who’s just taken it
out of his trunk. It bursts open and clothes and toilet
articles go flying everywhere. This slows Cole momentarily.
Claire throws open the passenger door and is going to leap.
Cole grabs her and tries to slam the door shut, Claire fights
to keep it open:

CLAIRE
(screaming)
Let me out!

Cole siams on the brakes. Claire leaps out of the car. Cole
tries to back up. She finds the stairs and starts to the
lower level. Cole abandons the car and takes off after her -

COLE
- wait, just wait -

Cole leaps the railing and drops to the ground right in front
of her.

She turns and walks away. Cole hesitates, then takes off
after her. As they walk side by side:

COLE
Okay, call the police. I’m not
leaving till you talk to me.

They walk a few more steps.

CLAIRE
I’ve got nothing to say.

COLE
Well I do.

Claire stops on a dime. She turns to him. With deadly
force:

CLAIRE
Okay, great. Let’s hear it.

Cole tries to work his mouth but nothing comes out.

CLAIRE
That’s it? Fine.

She turns to go again. Cole grabs her. The look she gives
him makes him release her immediately.

CLAIRE
You shouldn’t be driving a car
anywhere - not on the road, not on
a race track and not in a parking
lot. You are selfish and you are
crazy and you are scared —-

COLE .
I’m not scared -

CLAIRE

(almost shouting)
You are scared to death.

(then)
You and Rowdy have the same
sickness - it’s called denial, and
it’s probably going to kill you
both.

She turns away and gets about ten steps. Can’t stand it and
marches back.

CLAIRE
You want to control something
that’s out of control, that’s what
you said to me wasn’t it?

CLAIRE (cont’d)
Well I’m going to let you in ona
secret that almost everybody else
in the world automatically knows -
control is an illusion, you
infantile egomaniac. Nobody knows
what’s going to happen next - not
on the freeway, not in an
airplane, not inside our own
bodies, and certainly not on a
racetrack with 40 other infantile
egomaniacs. Nobody knows and
nobody controls anything - you've
gotten a glimpse of that and
you’re scared. You may not have
the courage to race anymore. You
may never have had it - Oh God, I
hate you for this you son of a
bitch! You've made me sound like
a doctor -

She spits this last out, near tears and walks away.

Cole slouches back into his car.
EXT LAUNDROMAT-DRY CLEANERS (DAY) 212

Cole’s bike is parked outside an establishment off the
highway and on the edge of town. He slouches out of the
place carrying a couple of brown paper laundry bags, sporting
a three day growth of beard and wearing clothes that look
like he’s been in them three days. He’s a mess. He ties the
laundry bags onto his bike with bungy cords, or starts to.

He walks over and leans on a fence at the edge of the
laundromat.

BELOW HIM 213

is an abandoned football field. It’s one of those all
purpose places - soccer goals as well as dilapidated goal
posts sprout from a field of dirty weeds and dying grass.

Two kids in beat up old cars are racin’, digging a loose oval
with their tires from goal post to goal post, yelling at each
other, frammin’ and bammin’ all over the place, and having a
hell of a time ~ cheered on by a couple of girls and their
buddies from the sidelines. Cole watches as the eager
drivers keep going back and forth, round and round, back and
forth, round and round...

EXT MEADOW (DAY) ‘ 214

Rowdy’s at work on a hay baling machine, back to CAMERA.
He’s chewing headache tablets (the meadow is littered with
Goody’s wrappers.) Rowdy turns off the machine. He presses
his hands to his temples. In the silence there’s a familiar
sound coming up through the hollow. Rowdy doesn’t turn
toward the sound. He waits for it to reach him.

shuts down his motorcycle and stares at Rowdy’s back. It’s
almost as if he’s afraid to see his face.

{without turning)
Hear you’re out of a job.

COLE
- yep.

INT DEN ROWDY’S LAKE HOUSE (DAY) 216

Amid lengthening shadows Rowdy wanders around, chewing more
Goody’s headache powders and drinking a beer. Cole lounges
on a sofa, under a row of racing trophies on a table behind
it.
COLE
You’re not looking too good.

ROWDY
Neither are you.

Rowdy smiles but it’s more of a grimace because of the pain
he’s in. He pops another headache tablet.

COLE
How many of those things you chew
every day?

ROWDY
(shrugs)
Like you said I can’t count past
five. What you come here for
anyway?

Cole pulls out a pair of airline tickets and tosses them on
the table next to the trophies.

COLE
Take you to the hospital.

Rowdy smirks.

ROWDY
Drummin’ up business for your lady
friend.

COLE

Can’t drive unless you go.

ROWDY

track weeks ago -

Shit I’ve raced with my legs
broke, my heart bruised, eyes
popped outta my head like they was
on springs, this’1l go away like
anything else - far as I’m
concerned I’m gonna live forever
unless I go to some damn hospital
where they take off your shoes,
make you shut your eyes, and bang
you're dead.

Cole nods. He rises, indicates a trophy next to a rack with
golf clubs and a couple of basebali bats.

COLE
What’d you win this for?

Rowdy stares. He obviously doesn’t know.

ROWDY
Doesn’t it say?

COLE
Yeah - it’s the Winston Cup,
buddy. Well hell, that’s an easy
one to forget. What’s your name
or has that slipped your mind?

Rowdy turns away. Cole picks a baseball bat out of the rack.

He slams it hard into the table. The trophies jump and Rowdy
does too.

COLE
Okay, we can fix your head here or
down there, what’s it gonna be?

ROWDY
Well, the doc here says I need
minor brain surgery.

CLAIRE
That’s not exactly how I put it.

COLE
- listen, any surgery on his brain
is bound to be minor.

All three laugh. Then there’s an uncomfortable silence.
Claire regards both men carefully. Cole won’t look at her.

ROWDY .
Listen doc, can I talk to this guy
a second?

CLAIRE
Of course -
(she touches Cole, he nearly
jumps)
- can I get you a cup of coffee?

COLE
(politely)
Oh no thank you anyway -

Still he won’t look directly at her. She shows her
disappointment, then leaves. After a moment:

Cole nods.

ROWDY
They say I busted a blood vessel
in my brain...

ROWDY
- so they wanna drill a hole in my
head, ha, ha, get rid of the leaky
blood...
(very directly)
You reckon I should let ‘em, Cole?

Cole is shocked. It’s clear Rowdy’s going to depend heavily
on Cole’s answer.

Cole moves over to Rowdy’s bedside.

COLE
- you’ve got plenty of time to get
ready for Daytona, Rowdy. You

Rowdy suddenly grips Cole’s arm and holds on tight. His
voice is thick:
ROWDY

- come outta this deal, okay!..

his voice is very low)
+. lost my sponsor. I got a
lotta land and a lotta plans that
ain’t paid for. I’m a jackass.

wouldn’t be left with a pot to pee
in or a window to throw it out..

Rowdy’s eyes well up. He’s deeply ashamed and can’t look at
Cole.

Cole can’t trust himself to speak. He shakes his head.

Cole nods. Rowdy heaves a sigh of relief.

Cole ducks back down. Claire comes into view, out of breath
in her hospital whites and staring directly up at him.

said you are..are you?..

She looks so unhinged that Cole comes back down the ramp,
drops his carry on.

coffee cans and styrofoam cups.

HARRY
- so anyway. there was this coal
mine I believed was gonna make me

the room going over memorabilia past the windows which are
now dark and back into the room which is now empty except for
Harry and one good ol boy who is having a hard time making it
to the end of Harry’s tale: :

Meanwhile Buck and Cole are going over some memorabilia and
Harry is having a hard time ignoring them. Cole holds a

photo of a young man who looks like a sophisticated version
of Buck sitting on a railing staring at Harry. Cole laughs.

HARRY
You can’t do it, period!..anda I
ain‘t goin’ back there, Cole.

Harry leaves the kitchen table.
INT. BARN (NIGHT)

Harry’s turning out lights as Cole enters the barn - standing
near the spot where Harry built their first car.

COLE
Buddy didn’t really die of a heart
attack, did he?

HARRY
--oh, his heart attacked him all
right, but not in the car. You
don’t want to hear about it. I’m
going to bed - lock up when you
leave -

OF
     

Jan 16 1990. 114.

Harry just about makes it thru the doorway when Cole stops
him:

COLE
Nascar privately claimed the
Set-up on the car killed Buddy,
that you used thin wall tubing to
keep the weight down, exhaust
fumes broke through the firewall
and carbon monoxide knocked Buddy
out. They said they'd investigate
unless you agreed to retire.

HARRY
(turns back, slowly)
:-you sound like you actually
learned a thing or two about race
cars.

COLE
(pursuing it)
- S50 you agreed to retire.

i HARRY

. - yeah I agreed and they come up

; with this heart attack horseshit!

: when Buddy hit the wall at the
third turn he was jabberin’ on the
radio about as fast as he was
driving, carbon monoxide my ass
that was the loudest talking
unconscious man you ever heard in
your life!..

Harry’s been talking pretty fast himself. He suddenly seems
spent.

HARRY
:-nothin’ killed Buddy but his
imagination.

COLE
Then why didn’t you let ‘em
investigate?..why Harry?

HARRY

- cos I shoulda known better than
to let him drive in the first
place. Cos I know race car
drivers, Cole.. a driver gets his
bell rung and a couple of lights
flicker, or he gets rich and he’s
always been poor, or he gets a
family and he worries about them.
He gets frightened or fat and
loses what he needs more than his
eyesight, more than his reflexes,
more than anything in the world -
he loses his need, his need. His
need to drive right out there on
the ragged edge..

(holds an empty Mason jar

upside down)
- when that’s gone, it’s gone and
there ain‘’t no still where you can
go to fill it up.. Buddy was a
terrible pain in the ass. He
thought he knew about cars which »,
made him twice as ignorant as you.
I mean he would lay everything
wrong on us, particularly when he
started gettin’ scared. If he
burnt up a ring because he forgot
to turn on a ring cooler I didn’t
say nothin’. If the brakes went
out because he abused ‘em, it was
my fault..but still, I look at
guys like..

{he obviously means Cole as

well but can’t say it)
+. Buddy, I seen him do things in
my race car that’s absolutely
unbelievable..that really showed
me what I’d done..and then you
see, you’re going to automatically
have to sort of love that guy
whether you want to or not..

Harry breaks off. He is too emotional to continue. Cole
waits a long moment.

COLE
Harry, I have to ask you
something..before Buddy hit the
wall, how was he actually doing in
that race?

Harry can’t believe it. He rises unsteadily, starts to go
after Cole.
Jan 16 1990. . 116.

HARRY
You ornery, no good son-of~a-
bitch -

COLE

(backing up)
Harry, I don’t want you to hurt
yourself - I’m countin’ on you to
set up the car -

HARRY
- you get back in that car and
you’ll die - :

Cole stops backing up.

COLE
I’m not getting back in my car.
I’m getting in Rowdy’s!

Harry smashes the Mason jar to the ground.

j ~ KARRY

h - that sounds just dumb enough to
be a race driver! You think

} you'll hide from your bad luck

. in his car? and what the hell
for? For Rowdy? If he could run
tomorrow he’d crash you to win
the race. He’s mean. He’s no
particular friend. Why?

COLE
Because he asked me to.

HARRY

- and you do anything somebody
asks you?

The two men are now toe to tee. spitting it at him:

COLE

When they need it as bad as Rowdy °
does ~ yes.

This hits Harry like a punch. The need. For a moment it
appears he’s been had. Then his lips curl like an animal's
about to attack. it explodes from him:

HARRY
HORSESHIT. You just want to race!

COLE
Yeah and so do you.

HARRY
You’re scared!

Jan 16 1990.

116A.

COLE
Yeah and so are you!..but I’m not
Buddy Bretherton, I haven’t been
doing this for twenty years, it’s
too soon for me to be scared.
There’s something else.Daytona.
You’ve never won it Harry, not
with Buddy, not with me, not ever.
We promised we’d do it.

Harry is agonized. He does want it. He looks to Cole,

helpless:

HARRY
--I honestly just wouldn’t know
how this deal’s gonna turn out
Cole..

COLE
I don’t know either Harry. But
goddam ~ aren’t you curious to
find out?

Nov 20 1989. 117.

NED JARRETT
- but today, Bob Jenkins, these
drivers have only one thing on
their minds, the crown jewel, the
superbowl of racing - the Daytona
500 -

During this the gorgeous and vulgar panoply of pre-race
Daytona at the opening is reprised, but now there are
recognizable characters in the crowd:

Daland with Waddell and Russ Wheeler walk with their car as
it’s being pushed onto the track. Daland spots Harry at the
Rowdy Burns car, hood up, Nascar inspector present. Darryl
Waltrip kisses his little baby girl before he ambles onto the
track. Ken Schrader walks hand in hand with his wife down
the twin lanes of cars. He takes off his soft cap and hands
it to her. Begins to put on his helmet. She watches.

NED JARRETT V.0O.
- well it’s certainly been a
strange turn of events and it must
be a peculiar feeling for Cole ~
Trickle, just about to get into
that 51 car with Rowdy Burns’ name
on it -

BENNY PARSONS V.0O.
~ well Ned he probably figures it
this way, he won’t have to worry
about looking for it in his rear
view mirror ~

Daland moves up to Harry, who is still working on the engine,
hood raised, the Nascar official hovering, watching every
move,

DALAND
(quietly)
- you told me you guys didn’t have
a sponsor -

He’s referring to the Mellow Yellow that has replaced the
EXXON on Rowdy’s hood.

HARRY
- they give us just about enough
money to paint their name on the
car -

Daland nods, moves on. Cole is walking down the track hand
in hand with Claire and talking quietly when he spots his
car. He breaks into a dead run. Arrives in a sweat:

COLE
What’s the hood doing up?
    

Nov 20 1989. 118.

HARRY
We had to change engines and
forgot to tighten the oil line.

COLE aa
Why’d you have to change engines?

HARRY
Found some metal in the Oberg
filter - I’m sure that explains it
for you.

Obviously it doesn’t. Cole smiles a tentative, sheepish
smile. Then he’s back on it:

COLE
Where‘d you get the engine?

HARRY
We stole it.

Cole spots Daland talking to Wheeler. Wheeler waves, winks.

‘,

COLE ‘
What were you talking to Daland
about?
: HARRY

Claire, put this boy in the car.
Tell him to wait till he gets on
the track before he starts
sweatin’ - it’s gonna be fine.

Claire walks with Cole to the driver’s side.

CLAIRE
(lightly)
- drive carefully -

COLE
I will..just gonna give Rowdy a
decent showing, I’m not gonna kill
myself...

He’s meant this figuratively, but it’s literal meaning hits
them both.

CLAIRE
- good.

She gives him a lingering kiss and he slips inte the car.
The webbing drops and Claire looks like she’s just walked
: under a dark cloud - then she’s suddenly grabbed by the hand.
Nov 20 1989. . 119.

ON THE TRACK — 225

NASCAR OFFICIAL
- and now to give us the most
famous words in racing, Rowdy
Burns..

There is sustained applause from the crowd - with a couple of
isolated boos, which Rowdy particularly appreciates. He
waves with the cane he’s using. Stands between the two rows
of. cars.

ROWDY

- thank you. I/’d rather be in my
car today but one way or another
it’s nice te be back on the track.
I especially want to thank this
gal here -

(he’s holding Claire's hand)
- she’s the one that put the hole
in my head a lot of you claimed
was already there - gentlemen,
start your engines -

There is a roar that is louder than anything heard thus far.
Claire can’t believe the sound. The cars fly past her and
Rowdy. Rowdy spots Cole as he passes, gives him a hi sign.
Cole returns it automatically. Claire looks worried.

ROWDY
(as they leave the track)
We don’t got a thing to worry
about, doc -

Claire tries to look reassured.

ROWDY (cont’d)

You watch. That boy can’t help
himself - he’s gonna win this race
or die tryin’.

Rowdy chuckles.
JUST ABOVE THE "0" 226

in Daytona the green flag waves. The cars cross the stripe
in a roar and a blur. The race is on.

RANDOM SHOTS 227

of the race in progress. There are spins, crashes, smoking
tires, yellow flags, pit stops, green flags.

BOB JENKINS V.O.
- after 125 laps here at the
Daytona 500 the leader is Dale
Earnhardt, followed by Rusty
Wallace, Harry Gant, Russ
Wheeler...

 
 

 

Nov 20 1989. 120.

Jenkins sets the first ten places, then superimposes the next
five. Cole is not among them. CAMERA drifts further back in
the field. -
BOB JENKINS V.0. (cont‘d)

- the much anticipated duel

between the Daland/Russ Wheeler .

Hardees car and Cole Trickle has

not been a factor here so far, Ned

Jarrett -

NED JARRETT V.0.
(as CAMERA isolates Cole)
- well Trickle’s certainly running
a different kind of race today.
He’s stayed in the middle of the
pack and appears to be content to
let others do the hard chargin’ -

INT. CAR COLE 228
expression set. Perspiring.

HARRY’S VOICE
~ :47:01, leader is :45:90

ROWDY - PITS 229
watching with Claire doesn’t look overly pleased. :
ON THE TRACK 230

the hood from one in the crowd of cars in front of Cole pops
up. The driver loses control. He bounces off several cars
and hits the wall. It’s a multi-car crash. The car hood
helicopters high in the air. :

INT. CAR COLE 231

fights his way through the smoke and fire and then sees it -
the helicoptering car hood @escending and heading right for
his cockpit. He screams. Turns to the infield to avoid
impact - the hood just brushes him on the passenger side.

WITH HARRY - PITS 232

HARRY
~ there’s some oil at the bottom
of turn three, leader’s just taken
it - you all right?

COLE’S VOICE
~ seems like there’s a hundred
cars out here.

HARRY
You’re not used to runnin’ ina
crowd.
Nov 20 1989. 121.

WITH COLE . 233
This registers. He puts his foot on the gas.
WIDER ANGLE TRACK . 234

BOB JENKINS V.0O.
- we're back under green here at
the Daytona 500 and somebody
appears to have lit a fire under
the 51 car ~

Cole is threading his way high and low through traffic. He
spots Gant and Wheeler running side by side.

NED JARRETT V.0.
- right now he’s coming up on the
leaders Gant and Wheeler -

COLE'S POV 235

There’s barely a car’s width between Wheeler and Gant. Cole
takes the plunge, scraping right between them. .

The two cars are buffeted by the near impact and Cole emerges
in the lead.

BENNY PARSONS
- now what do we call that, Ned
Jarrett? A Trickle sandwich?

NED JARRETT
= might as well - after 165 laps
Cole Trickle’s the new leader here
at the Daytona 500 -

The crowd has gone wild. Harry isn’t sure what to think.

Rowdy nudges Claire ~ he knew it all along. Claire is

worried.

INT. CAR COLE + 236
perspiring more heavily than ever.

HARRY’S VOICE :
I don’t believe you did that.

COLE
.Neither do I.

INT. CAR RUSS WHEELER 237

who. doesn’t believe it either. His steady stream of
invective is lost in the engine’s roar.

WITH HARRY : - PITS 238

talking patiently into the radio.

 
Nov 20 1989. 122.

WITH CLAIRE - PITS 239
more nervous than ever.
WITH COLE - TRACK 240

running out front. He spots Wheeler coming up behind him.
He jams his foot on the accelerator to get all the speed he
can. He holds it to the floor going into turn three.

CLOSE PEDAL - TRACK 241

with Cole’s foot pressing it through the floor. There is a
tiny snap. When Cole’s foot comes off the gas to brake, the
accelerator remains jammed on the floor.

WITH COLE - TRACK 242

as the wall on turn three approaches. He brakes. The car
doesn’t slow. It continues running full ovt. The wall
approaches in lightning leaps. Cole jams his foot harder on
the brake. He jams both feet on the brake. Smoke drifts

up from the floorboards. Cole just makes it through the

turn, the car running an odd line. .
WITH HARRY - PITS 243
noticing.

HARRY
What’s goin’ on?

COLE
.-accelerator’s stuck. What can I
do, Harry?..Harry?

Harry’s beside himself but tries to be calm for Cole.

HARRY
{as calm as he can)
- oh, pop the clutch and blow the
engine - you got no choice
Cole..you done good, but it’s
over..

WITH COLE - TRACK 244

going down the backstretch, still in the lead. The wall is
approaching. He starts to come down on the clutch but
changes his mind and brakes ~ smoke flies up through the
floorboard. Cole makes it through the turn, still in the
lead.

NED JARRETT V.0.
Trickle’s runnin’ a very peculiar
line out there..
 

Nov 20 1989. 123.

HARRY’S VOICE
You try that again and you‘re
gonna have a car runnin’ flat out
with no brakes -

DOWN THE FRONT STRETCH 245

Cole is trying to reach the dash but can’t. He is strapped
in too tightly. He loosens the shoulder harness.

 

COLE .
How many more laps?

HARRY’S VOICE
cole!

His shoulder harness is now loose enough for him to reach the
dash. His fingers struggle toward a button on the dash but
the wall is approaching too quickly. He has to jam on the
brakes again. The cockpit fills with smoke.

BOB JENKINS
- with thirty-two laps to go,
Trickle is still leading Russ
Wheeler at the Daytona 500 -

NED JARRETT
(an urgency that breaks thru
his professional demeanor)
There’s somethin’ definitely wrong
with that race car -

 

BOB JENKINS
Let’s go down to Dr. Jerry Punch -

JERRY PUNCH 7 PITS 246
in the pit with Harry. Claire and Rowdy nearby.

PUNCH
- apparently there seems to be
some sort of carburetor linkage
problem with the Cole Trickle car,
how about it Harry?

 

He holds the microphone under Harry’s nose. Harry is
sweating bullets. He ignores Punch.

PUNCH
Harry?

HARRY
The fucking accelerator is stuck
to the floorboard! now would you
excuse me please?

PUNCH
Well, back to you Bob Jenkins -
 

Nov 20 1989. 124.

INT. CAR COLE : 247
“approaching the wall again.

: HARRY’S VOICE
Cole? You can’t brake anymore.
- You blow that engine now, hear?

Cole reaches out and flips the switch he couldn’t reach
before. There is silence in the cockpit. He glides through
the turn, struggling with the wheel, and keeping Wheeler
behind him.

FROM A DISTANCE : 248
the line of the car looks smoother.

HARRY
(astonished)
What the hell’d you do?

COLE’S VOICE
I might not know much about cars,
Harry..but I know how to turn ‘en
on and off..

INT. CAR COLE 249

He’s through the turn. He hits the ignition just as Wheeler
pulls up alongside him. His engine roars and he pulls ahead
once again.

RARRY’S VOICE
- you can’t do that for
twenty-five more laps..

,COLE’S VOICE
I’m gonna try..

Coming off the straightaway and into the turn Cole flips the
switch. Again there’s an eery silence. Cole holds through
the turn, fighting to stay in the groove. Wheeler’s right
behind hin.

WIDE ANGLE TRACK 250

BENNY PARSONS V.O.
I don’t see how he can keep doing
this..

NED JARRETT V.O.
Benny you been saying that for 10
laps.

BENNY PARSONS V.0O.
And I still don’t see it -.
Nov 20 1989. 125.

BOB JENKINS V.0O.
With just over 5 laps to go here
at Daytona Cole. Trickle has
managed to cling to the thinnest
ef leads under extraordinary
conditions...

AT THE THIRD TURN = TRACK 251

Cole shuts off and moves into it. As he does Wheeler moves
closer, The progressive shutting on and off of his engine

has brought Wheeler to the point where he’s finally reached
Cole’s bumper. He gives it a nudge.

INT. CAR COLE 252

with no engine the tiniest of nudges sends him careening
wildly. Nearly through the turn he tries to turn on the
engine but it’s too late ~ he slams into the wall with two
flat tires.

Wheeler takes the lead. The caution flag comes out. The
cars slow down. Harry hangs his head.
“

INT. CAR COLE ° 253

looks down. He sees the impact has freed the accelerator.

He turns on the engine. The gears grind. He swears
furiously.

HARRY’S VOICE
Cole, you okay?

COLE
- the good news is the
accelerator’s fixed - the bad news
is the transmission’s fucked.
What can I do?

HARRY - PITS 254
comes to life.

HARRY
Hell, Cole seein’ as you do
everything else backwards - try
reverse.

COLE - TRACK 255

slams the car into reverse and it works. He comes screaming
down the track backwards at nearly eighty miles an hour,
catching up with the pack. He reaches pit road and brakes,
flipping the car 180 degrees, pitting perfectly.

Buck leads the charge. His over-the-wall-gang jack up the
car, change the tires. Buck struggles with the transmission.
Nov 20 1989. / 126.

HARRY
You can’t fix it, just get it in
high gear -

Harry and Buck twist the linkage, drop the car to the road -
the car sputters in high gear. His crew have to keep pushing
it down the road.

DALAND WITH WHEELER’S CREW 256
watch. Cole’s car is dying without more momentum.

Daland signals Wheeler's crew. They rush out and together
with Harry and his crew, they push Cole’s car. It stops
sputtering and moves onto the track where the cars are still
running under caution.

NASCAR OFFICIAL
(to Daland)
You can’t do that. It’s not your
car.

DALAND
It sure as hell is my engine in _
that car - that’s what my boys are
pushin’.

WHEELER - TRACK 257
looks thru his rear view mirror. He can’t believe Cole is

back on the track. He momentarily fails to see the pace car
has gone off the track.

WADDELL’S VOICE
Green flag! Green flag! what the
hell are you waitin’ on Russ?
Wheeler takes off but keeps one eye on his rear view mirror.
INT. CAR COLE 258

COLE
Where am I?

HARRY’S VOICE
Runnin’ seventh.

COLE
How many laps to go?

HARRY’S VOICE
Three.

ON THE TRACK 259

Cole threads his way relentlessly thru traffic.
   

Nov 20 1989. : : 127.

AT THE STRIPE: 260

the white flag is waved. Cole crosses it and passes another
car. There’s only one remaining between Cole and Wheeler,

WITH WHEELER 261

growing more and more edgy. He makes it thru the secong
turn. Checks his rear view mirror. He sees Cole move out
behind the number two car. Cole Passes it and is now growing
in Wheeler's rear view mirror as Wheeler approaches the third
turn. Wheeler is fascinated. As Cole’s car continues to
fill up Wheeler’s rear view mirror, Wheeler keeps watching
and watching and drives right off the track and into the
infield. Ha ploughs into the huge mound of earth in front of

EXT. PIT Roap 262

Harry, Buck, Claire, Rowdy, and the pit crew begin to race
toward the finish,

THE CHECKERED FLAG 263

is waving over the "o" in Daytona. The crowd sutges and
roars. Cole crosses the stripe.

ON THE TRACK 264

Cole’s car is mobbed. As the webbing is pulled back - freeze
frame to:

PHOTOGRAPHS IN VICTORY LANE 265
as quick as the shots of Cole in his first win at Pocono -
