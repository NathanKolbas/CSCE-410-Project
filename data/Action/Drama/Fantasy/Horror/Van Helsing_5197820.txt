VAN HELSING
by

Stephen Sommers
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES across the OLD UNIVERSAL LOGO. And then a
FLAMING TORCH BURNS IT AWAY and we find ourselves in the
middle of an angry mob of torch-wielding PEASANTS. Crashing
through a dark forest. Heading for a huge CASTLE. A BOLT OF
LIGHTNING STRIKES conductors above the skylight on top of the
castle. - This entire opening sequence is in BLACK & WHITE.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

A PAIR OF STRANGE EYES suddenly comes alive, peering out
through slits in stained bandages.

A MAN spins around into a CLOSE-UP, his elegant face is
covered in soot, sweat, and taut lines of exhaustion. But his
eyes sparkle with an incredible intelligence, bordering on
madness. This is DOCTOR VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN. He yells one of
the most famous phrases in film history:

VICTOR
He's alive .... He's alive!! ...
HE'S ALIIIIVE!!!

 

 

Behind him, lying in a form-fitted iron pod, is a huge man,
face covered in bandages. A loud CRASH spins Victor around,
he runs to a window and looks out. Over his shoulder we see
the mob charge the front gate with a tree trunk-CRASH! Wood
SPLINTERS. But the gate holds. Victor starts to panic, he
spins around and comes face-to-face with a DARK FIGURE.

DRACULA (DARK FIGURE)
Success!!

Victor SCREAMS in fright, then catches himself

VICTOR
Oh ... Count ... it's just you.

The Dark Figure steps forward into the flickering electrical
light-show. Tall, dark, and incredibly handsome, he reeks of
evil. This is COUNT VLADISLAUS DRACULA.

DRACULA
I was beginning to lose faith,
Victor.

He looks our at the screaming mob.

DRACULA (CONT'D)

A pity your moment of triumph is
being spoiled over a little thing
like grave robbery.
EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT
A creepy guy in a TOP HAT and undertaker's suit YELLS OUT:

TOP HAT
You know what he's doing in there!
To the bodies of your loved ones!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Victor is clearly on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

VICTOR
I must ... I must escape this
place.

Victor dashes across his laboratory; the Industrial Age at
its grotesque beginnings. Weird iron generators and enormous
copper dynamos line the walls. Huge gears GRIND. Massive fan
belts WHIRL. Electricity ARCS everywhere. Dracula is now high
up in the rafters, as if magically transported.

DRACULA
Where are you going to run, Victor?

SPARKS rain down as Victor throws open a traveling chest and
wildly begins packing. Dracula is suddenly on the complete
opposite side of the room, pacing the mantelpiece.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Your peculiar experiments have made
you ... unwelcome, in most of the
civilized world.

Victor looks up at Dracula, momentarily confused by Dracula's
impossible moves.

VICTOR
I'll take him away, far away, where
no one will ever find him.

He starts packing again, bur Dracula is suddenly right next
to him. He steps on the lid of the trunk and slams it shut.

DRACULA
No, Victor, the time has come for
me to take command of him.

VICTOR
What are you saying?
DRACULA
Why do you think I brought you
here? Gave you this castle?
Equipped your lab?

VICTOR
You said you believed in my work.

DRACULA
And I do. But now that it is, as
you yourself said, "a triumph of
science over god," it must now
serve my purpose.

VICTOR
What purpose?

EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

WHAM! goes the tree trunk. Splinters FLY. The gate starts to
give. The Crowd CHEERS. Thunder ROARS.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Victor's eyes slowly widen in horror, he starts to back away.

VICTOR
Good lord ... I would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

DRACULA
Feel free. I don't actually need
you anymore, Victor. I just need
him ... he is the key.

Dracula moves in for the kill. Victor backs away towards the
roaring fireplace, eyes narrowing in defiance.

VICTOR
Before I would allow him to be used
for such evil, I would destroy him.

DRACULA
I cannot allow that to happen. My
brides would be very put out.

VICTOR
IGOR! ... Help me!

A despicable little hunchback with horrible buck teeth and an
evil eye stares down from the rafters. This is IGOR.
IGOR
You have been so kind to me.
Doctor, so caring and thoughtful
(gestures out to the mob)
But if they catch me, they'll hang
me again.

Igor reveals his horribly disfigured broken neck. Victor
quickly reaches the mantel and grabs a sabre crossed over the
Frankenstein family coat-of-arms.

VICTOR
Stay back!

DRACULA
You can't kill me, Victor ...

Dracula impales himself on Victor's sabre and keeps walking,
impaling himself all the way up to the hilt, bringing the two
men eye-to-eye. Victor is beyond shocked. Dracula smiles.
DRACULA (CONT'D)
--- I'm already dead.
EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

CRASH! goes the front gate. EXPLODING into splinters.
Peasants and torches pour through. LIGHTNING FLASHES.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula's canines glide out into razor sharp fangs, all the
blood drains from his face, his hair turns pure white. Victor
SCREAMS. The Count bites down into his neck.

Up in the rafters, Igor scurries off through a door, slamming
it behind him as Victor's SHADOW is murdered above it.

Dracula drops Victor's limp body to the floor. And that's
when a horrific ANGUISHED BELLOW suddenly fills the room.

FRANKENSTEIN
Nooo!

Dracula spins around, dropping Victor to the floor. A dynamo
hits Dracula full on. He and the dynamo are flung into the
fireplace, scattering flaming logs and embers.

A bandaged APPARITION scoops Victor into its arms.
EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

Igor scurries our a small door outside the castle wall and
closes it behind him, then he looks up over the wall to the
peasants storming the upper ramparts. He cackles in glee. The
door behind him suddenly bursts open. The Apparition races
out, carrying Victor in its arms. It blows past Igor and
heads off across the moors, heading for an old WINDMILL up on
a bluff. Igor is shocked and panicked, he quickly looks up at
the peasants and points to the Apparition.

IGOR
FRANKENSTEIN! He's created a
monster! !

Igor fearfully scurries off into the shadows.
EXT. RAMPART - NIGHT
Up on the ramparts, Top Hat points down SCREAMS:

TOP HAT
LOOK! It's headed for the windmill!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

From inside the fireplace, the Count flings the massive
dynamo across the laboratory. It hits a generator that blasts
into a flume of sparks and fire. The Count charges out of the
fireplace, his face is a burned mess, but it quickly and
completely heals.

EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT

The mob charges across the moors, chasing the Apparition
towards the windmill.

INT. WINDMILL - NIGHT

The mob charges the windmill. The creature slams the door
shut on them, then dashes across the room, which is an old
Absinthe Still. He rampages up a rickety wooden staircase.

EXT. TOP OF WINDMILL - NIGHT

At the top of the windmill, the creature rages through a
splintering door and looks down at the crazed mob below. We
finally get our first good look at FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER:
bolts, scars, stitches, and the back of his head is made of
glass, a small electrical storm is going off inside it. But
the look in his eyes surprises us, he is terrified, this
tremendous beast of a man is actually fearful.
FRANKENSTEIN
Why? ...

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula's SHADOW rises up the laboratory walls and TRANSFORMS
into something huge, with wings.

EXT. TOP OF WINDMILL - NIGHT

Frankenstein groans in fear as a thick unbroken band of
FLICKERING TORCHES encircles the windmill. The SCREAMING
peasants throw their torches. A noose of FLAME leaps up the
walls. The Monster ROARS. Then looks off at the castle. Off
in the distance, the castle's glass skylight bursts as a
WINGED SHADOW explodes up out of it. High up in the dark,
thunder-racked sky, THREE MORE liquid-like SHADOWS come
flying through the roiling purple clouds to join it.

PEASANTS
Vampires! Run for your lives!

The huge crowd flees in horror across the moors. The FLAMES
have surged up the windmill and now surround Frankenstein's
Monster. He looks down at Victor and hugs him tightly to his
chest.

FRANKENSTEIN
Father ...

Then with tears on his cheeks, he lifts a fist towards the
oncoming shadows above and lets our an anguished BELLOW.

And that's when the entire windmill IMPLODES. Taking the
Monster and his creator down with it. The timber and the
gears and the fans and all the ironwork plummet downward. A
huge ball of FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS flies everywhere.

Huge billowing WINGS suddenly fly right over CAMERA,
practically WIPING FRAME. They immediately become a CAPE,
which wraps around Dracula as he hits the ground running.

And then three billowing WHITE WINGS fly over CAMERA, and
they wrap around three exorically gorgeous young women.
Dracula's BRIDES: ALEERA, VERONA, and MARISHKA.

Dracula staggers to a stop and stares in desperation at the
flaming wreckage. His Brides are distraught beyond words:
they burst into tears, wailing with inhuman shrieks.
WE PUSH IN on the FLAMING windmill, belching its last sparks,
then slowly DISSOLVE TO its charred remains.

SUPER: ONE YEAR LATER
EXT. WINDMILL - DAY

The BLACK & WHITE ends, the FILM SATURATES, becoming a deep
blue, and then a huge, powerful BLUR rips past the ruins. The
sound it makes is incredibly deep, feral, and frightening.

EXT. FOREST CLEARING - GLOOMY DAY

Looking down through MASSIVE TREES onto a small clearing. A
handsome young MAN is tied to a post, hands above his head.
PRINCE VELKAN tenses at the sound of the approaching beast.
And then all goes quiet. Bushes rustle. Velkan's eyes look
left. A tree creaks. Velkan looks right. A branch sways.
Velkan waits for the inevitable. And then, 30 feet up a tree,
a massive WEREWOLF creeps out, clinging horizontally to the
bark. Ten feet tall. Fangs. Claws. The works. It hunches,
about to lunge. Velkan tenses.

VELKAN
Come on. Dracula unleashed you for
a reason.

The Werewolf leaps. Velkan's hands rip loose of his bindings.
He vaults himself up onto the top of the post just as the
Werewolf slams into it, just missing him. The Werewolf clings
to the post and looks up as Velkan leaps up and grabs a vine
hanging above the post.

BEHIND SOME BUSHES: Several MEN pull a lever.

The vine jerks Velkan up off the pole, heading for safety,
but then he comes to an abrupt stop. The look in his eyes
tells us this isn't part of the plan.

Behind the bushes the men are struggling with the lever.

VILLAGER
It's stuck! It's stuck!

A gorgeous young woman spins around and draws her sword: she
wears the sexy silk dress of a gypsy Princess, this is ANNA
VALERIOUS. One of the men grabs her.

MAN
No! Anna! It will kill you!
ANNA
(ripping free of his grip)
That's my brother out there!

Out in the clearing, the Werewolf snarls up at Velkan and
starts to hunch, about to lunge up at him. Anna charges out
of the bushes. The Werewolf sees her. So does Velkan.

VELKAN
Anna! No!

Anna raises her sword and keeps on charging. The Werewolf
snarls viciously and jumps off the pole, it immediately falls
through a camouflaged mesh covering the ground.

Behind the bushes a man swings an ax and chops the ropes
attached to the lever.

Out in the clearing, a huge iron CAGE rips up out of the
ground around the pole. Anna does a back-flip off the cage as
it's pulled up into the air.

Up on the vine, Velkan draws his silver revolver. The roof of
the cage springs shut, trapping the Werewolf inside. Velkan
aims down at the Werewolf, but the cage slams into him on
it's way up into the trees. His revolver goes flying. Velkan
and the cage are rocketed straight up into the huge trees.

EXT. FOREST - TREETOPS - DAY
Way up in the trees, the cage slams to a stop. Velkan leaps
off and lands on a branch. The cage starts crashing back and
forth, the Werewolf trying to rip its way out. Ropes snap.
VELKAN
My gun! Find my gun!
EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

Down in the clearing, Anna desperately looks around, several
men begin firing rifles up into the trees, Anna shoves one of
them out of her way.

ANNA
No! Find Velkan's gun! It has to be
the silver bullets!
EXT. FOREST - TREETOPS - DAY

Another rope snaps. The cage swings widly, now hanging by a
single rope.
EXT. FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

Anna spots Velkan's silver revolver on the far side of the
clearing. She runs for it. The cage suddenly SLAMS DOWN right
in front of her, cutting her off from the gun. The Werewolf
bursts out of the smashed cage. Anna turns and runs like
hell. The Werewolf spots her and gives chase.

Anna races through the foliage. The Werewolf's POV getting
closer and closer. Anna runs out of the forest and almost
goes over a cliff. She stops herself just short, it's a half
mile to the bottom, she spins around and starts to run back
into the foliage, then freezes as she sees trees and bushes
thrown into the air, the Werewolf getting closer and closer.
The Werewolf leaps out of the bushes, straight at Anna. Anna
is suddenly shoved out of the way by Velkan. He fires his
gun. The Werewolf HOWLS in pain, but manages to chomp into
Velkan's shoulder and tackle him OFF THE SCREEN.

Anna slams to the ground, then spins around, Velkan and the
Werewolf are gone. Only the revolver remains, still smoking.
Anna leaps up and looks over the edge of the misty cliff.
Velkan is nowhere in sight. Anna is devastated.

ANNA
Velkan ...

And then she hears something and spins around. It's the
Werewolf, lying in the bushes. Anna grabs the gun, levels it,
cocks it, and moves in for the kill. And that's when the
Werewolf TRANSFORMS, turning into a dying OLD MAN.

OLD MAN
Thank you.

Anna stares down at him, horrified. The Old Man smiles.

OLD MAN (CONT'D)
I die free from Dracula's awful

grip.
And then with the last of his energy he grabs Anna's ankle.
OLD MAN (CONT'D)
But now you must stop him! ... He

has a terrible secret ... He has
--. he has ... !
10.

The Old Man dies. Anna stares down at him, then looks off
over the precipice. WE PUSH IN on her tear-streaked face as
she shuts her eyes. Then PULL BACK as another FACE DISSOLVES
UP over hers. It's a "WANTED POSTER." Wanted for murder in
many countries is a MASKED MAN wearing a cloak, a cape, and a
black, wide-brimmed hat. His name is VAN HELSING. A HAND rips
the poster off the SCREEN and we suddenly find ourselves in:

PARIS, FRANCE - RAINY NIGHT

The hand belongs to a masked man in a cloak, a cape, anda
black, wide-brimmed hat. In the background is the Eiffel
Tower, half built. It's quiet. Too quiet. And then we hear a
blood curdling SCREAM. Van Helsing's eyes don't even flinch,
he calmly crumples the poster, chucks it, and moves off down
the foggy cobblestone lane, his cape flowing behind him.

EXT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT

WE PAN DOWN from NOTRE DAME to a WOMAN'S DEAD BODY lying on
the cobblestones in a puddle of blood, eyes wide open,
looking terrified. Van Helsing steps up and gives the body
the once over, studying the spoor. He picks up a smoldering
cigar stub next to the body, dripping with saliva, then he
freezes, eyes suddenly on the alert, he spins around and we
RACK FOCUS to the top of Notre Dame.

Way up on the North Tower, a huge, shadowy FIGURE clambers up
the sheer wall and vanishes over an upper railing.

INT. NOTRE DAME BELFRY - NIGHT

Van Helsing silently steps up into the belfry, which is dark
and dusty and covered in religious relics. Very Gothic.
Moonlight slices through the attic windows as Van Helsing
glides past the massive church bell, then he freezes, every
hair and muscle on his body suddenly tense. A long BEAT.

And then a gigantic malformed MAN DROPS DOWN three feet in
front of him, hanging upside-down from the rafters. He SNARLS
viciously. This is MISTER HYDE. Van Helsing gingerly takes
one step back, then pulls down his mask, revealing his
handsome face for the first time.

VAN HELSING
Evening.

Hyde's fleshy jowls spew phlegm as he speaks, a burning cigar
clamped between his rotten teeth.

MISTER HYDE
You're a big one. You'll be hard to
digest.
11.

VAN HELSING
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

Hyde flips around and lands on his gnarled feet. Van Helsing
sizes him up, all nine feet of him.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
I missed you in London.

MISTER HYDE
No you didn't.

Hyde lifts up his huge arm to show three cauterized BULLET
HOLES blown clear through his biceps.

MISTER HYDE (CONT'D)
You got me good.

Hyde starts to circle. Van Helsing does likewise.

VAN HELSING
Doctor Jekyll, you are wanted by
the Knights of the Holy Order-

MISTER HYDE
It's Mister Hyde now.

VAN HELSING
-for the murder of twelve men, six
women—

MISTER HYDE
-Four children, three goats and a
rather nasty massacre of poultry.
So you're the great Van Helsing.

He blows a huge smoke ring at Van Helsing. Van Helsing
ignores it.

VAN HELSING
And you are a deranged psychopath.

Hyde takes the red-hot cigar out of his mouth and crushes the
glowing his palm.

MISTER HYDE
We all have our little problems.

Van Helsing's whole mind and body to gear up.

VAN HELSING
My superiors would like for me to
take you alive, so that they may
extricate your better half.
12.

MISTER HYDE
They would, would they?

VAN HELSING
Personally, I'd rather just kill
you and call it a day.

Mister Hyde laughs. Van Helsing doesn’t.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Let's make it your decision, shall
we?

Hyde suddenly LASHES OUT with one of his huge hands, catches
Van Helsing across the face, slams him back into a wall. Van
Helsing calmly wipes the blood off his mouth.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Good, we're in agreement then.

In a lightning quick move, Van Helsing draws his revolvers
and FIRES. Like all of Van Helsing's weapons, they are highly
stylized, yet ruthlessly functional. The sound is thunderous.
As the smoke clears, Hyde is nowhere to be seen. Van Helsing
holsters his guns and moves forward. Mister Hyde suddenly
charges out of the darkness. Van Helsing instantly comes up
with circular BLADES in each hand. He spins around and cuts
Hyde across the ribs as he passes. Hyde howls in pain and,
unable to stop his own momentum, crashes straight into the
huge church BELL, which GONGS loudly. Hyde grabs his ears.

MISTER HYDE
The bell! THE BELL!!

Van Helsing moves in for the kill. His fingers start pumping
the spring-loaded blades, which begin to rotate, faster and
faster until they're a menacing blur of razor sharp steel.

Hyde grabs the huge bell, rips it off its moorings and slams
it down over Van Helsing, trapping him inside. Hyde chuckles.
And then he hears the blades buzzing away inside. Hyde looks
concerned, grabs the bell, and lifts it up. Van Helsing is

gone, and there's a big hole carved out of the wooden floor.

Hyde scowls, then hears the blades buzzing again. He looks
around. Van Helsing is nowhere in sight, then he looks up.
Van Helsing is crouched up inside the bell above Hyde's head.
He swings a blade. Mister Hyde's left arm drops to the floor.
Cut clean off. The bell crashes to the floor. Van Helsing
rolls free. He and Hyde stare at the severed arm, flapping
away on the floor.
13.

VAN HELSING
I'll bet that's upsetting.

The huge arm TRANSFORMS into the arm of a spindly old man.
Mister Hyde angrily lunges forward, grabs Van Helsing, and
throws him clear up through the top of the tower.

EXT. NORTH TOWER - NIGHT

Van Helsing explodes up through a wooden trap door and
crashes down hard to the deck. He tries to get up, but he's
nearly unconscious. Hyde leaps up beside him, picks him up by
the back of his collar and carries him across the tower.

MISTER HYDE
I think you'll find the view over
here rather spectacular.

At the edge of the tower, Hyde lifts Van Helsing up face-to-
face.

MISTER HYDE (CONT'D)
Been a pleasure knowing you.

Mister Hyde throws Van Helsing off the top of Notre Dame.
OKAY, EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION:

As Van Helsing plummets towards the cobblestones far below he
desperately whips out a grappling hook gun, aims, and fires
it upwards. The bolt shoots out, tether trailing behind it.
It blows right through Hyde's belly and shoots out of his
back.

TIGHT on the bolt as it slows in mid-air, tether slackening,
and then the serrated grappling HOOKS snap out, the tether
goes taut, and the whole thing is jerked back out of FRAME.

The grappling hooks slam into Mister Hyde's back. The tether
goes taut. Van Helsing snaps to a stop at the end of the
tether, two feet short of splattering into the cobblestones.
Hyde is jerked forward, but catches himself on the ledge. Van
Helsing gets to his feet, grabs the tether and yanks it. Hyde
is jerked over the edge, but a single toe stops him from
falling, his lone arm flails, and then with all his might he
throws himself backwards. READ FASTER:

Van Helsing is jerked up off the ground. Hyde stumbles back
and falls off the tear of the tower, he drops down and

crashes through the roof of the church. Van Helsing rockets
up the side of Notre Dame, heading for the top of the tower.
14.

INT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT

Mister Hyde swings down across the great church and right
into the Rose window.

EXT. NOTRE DAME - NIGHT

The massive window at the front and center of Notre Dame
explodes as Mister Hyde crashes through it. Van Helsing lands
on his feet at the top of the tower and looks down.

WE FOLLOW Mister Hyde down as he TRANSFORMS into a meek OLD
MAN, who has one deeply disturbing moment to consider his
predicament. And then he hits the pavement.

Up on the tower, Van Helsing looks genuinely remorseful, his
body slumps in sadness, he makes the sign-of-the cross.

VAN HELSING
God rest your soul. ...

EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT

Gendarmes, priests, and local denizens race up to the dead
body from every direction. Then they all look up to the top
of the North Tower, and are instantly terrified, several of
them run away in fear.

PEOPLE
Van Helsing! ... It's Van
Helsing!...

Silhouetted against the moon is our hero. The SERGEANT of the
gendarm raises an angry fist.

SERGEANT (0.S.)

Van Helsing you MURDERERRRR ...
SMASH CUT TO ROME - DAWN
The clock behind St. Peter's Basilica chimes as Van Helsing
trots his black stallion across the enormous Piazza San
Pierro, lined with Bernini's magnificent colonnades.

SUPER: VATICAN CITY

INT. ST. PETERS - DAWN

Gregorian CHANTING can be heard as Van Helsing strides
through the greatest church in all Christendom.
15.

INT. CONFESSIONAL - DAY
Inside an ornate confessional, Van Helsing drops to one knee.

VAN HELSING
Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned.

Knowing what's coming, Van Helsing grits his teeth. A tiny
partition door slams open. Through the wooden mesh we see
CARDINAL JINETTE, a tough old bird with piercing eyes.

CARDINAL JINETTE
You shattered the Rose window!

VAN HELSING
Not to split hairs, sir, but it was
Mister Hyde who did the shattering.

THIRTEEN
Thirteenth-century. Over six
hundred years old! I wish you a
week in hell for that!

VAN HELSING
It would be a nice reprieve.

CARDINAL JINETTE
Don't get me wrong, your results
are unquestionable, but your
methods draw far too much
attention. "Wanted posters"? We are
not pleased.

VAN HELSING
You think I like being the most
wanted man in Europe? Why don't you
and the Order do something about
it?

The Cardinal leans in and lowers his voice conspiratorially.

CARDINAL JINETTE
You know why, because "we" do not
exist.

VAN HELSING
Then neither do I.

Van Helsing gets up to go. The Cardinal pulls a lever. Bolts
on Van Helsing's door lock shut. The Cardinal leans in, all
fire and brimstone.
16.

CARDINAL JINETTE
When we found you crawling up the
steps of this church, half dead, it
was clear to all of us that you had
been sent to do God's work.

VAN HELSING
Why can't he do it himself?

CARDINAL JINETTE
Don't blaspheme! You already lost
your memory as a penance for past
sins.

The Cardinal pulls another lever, a series of gears slides
the back wall open, revealing a secret hidden staircase.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
If you wish to recover it, I
suggest you continue to heed the
call.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

The Cardinal and Van Helsing enter an enormous underground
ARMORY, bustling with action, lots of steam and fire.

CARDINAL JINETTE
Governments and empires come and
go, but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

Beneath the giant blast furnaces we see JEWISH RABBIS working
the billows, HINDU PRIESTS stoking the fires, and MUSLIM
CLERICS hammering red hot scimitars on anvils.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
We are the last defense against
evil. An evil that the rest of
Mankind has no idea even exists.

Van Helsing's eyes fill with torment, reliving past moments:

VAN HELSING
To you, these monsters are evil
beings to be vanquished, but I'm
the one left standing there when
they die and become the men they
once were.
17.

CARDINAL JINETTE
For you, my good son, this is all
a test of faith. That is why you
have no idea who you are or where
you came from.

Van Helsing gives him a look. The Cardinal smiles knowingly.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
Say you met God, and he set you on
a task, you would have no fear
because you would know that God was
with you, but if your memory of
meeting God were lost, then every
day would be a test of faith.

Van Helsing sighs heavily, we see the weariness in his eyes,
the weight of his calling pressing down upon him. The
Cardinal snaps his fingers and the LIGHT DIMS. A Rabbi turns
on a SLIDE PROJECTOR and starts clicking slides, showing the
way from Rome to Eastern Europe.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
We need you to go to the east, to
the far side of Romania, an
accursed land, terrorized by all
sorts of nightmarish creatures.

A slide of a handsome GOTHIC PRINCE comes up.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
Lorded over by a certain Count
Dracula.

Van Helsing's interest is immediately piqued.

VAN HELSING
Dracula.

Then a slide comes up showing a painting of an old fifteenth-
century NOBLEMAN, his suit of armor covered in holy crosses,
his name emblazoned on silver below it: VALERIOUS THE ELDER.

CARDINAL JINETTE
Four hundred and fifty years ago a
Transylvanian knight named
Valerious the Elder promised God
that his family would never rest,
nor enter heaven, until they
vanquished Dracula from their land.
They have not succeeded, and they
are running out of family.
18.

Several grainy black-and-white slides of a FAMILY come up. A
burly old KING and young Prince Velkan.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
Boris Valerio us, King of the
Gypsies, he went missing almost one
year ago. His son Velkan died just
last week.

VAN HELSING
And the girl?

Van Helsing gestures to Anna, riding her horse.

CARDINAL JINETTE
Princess Anna, the last of the
Valerio us. If she is killed, nine
generations of her family will
never enter the gates of St. Peter.

The room FLOODS WITH LIGHT. The Cardinal faces Van Helsing.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
For more than four centuries this
family has held down our left
flank. They gave their lives, we
cannot let them slip into
purgatory.

VAN HELSING
So you're sending me into hell.

CARDINAL JINETTE
In a manner.

An old Muslim Cleric steps up and hands something to the
Cardinal. The Cardinal holds it up for Van Helsing. It's a
TORN PIECE OF PAINTED CLOTH encased in a strip of glass.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
The old knight left this here four
hundred years ago. We don't know
its purpose, but he would not have
left it lightly.

Van Helsing stares at it. Painted on the cloth is PART OF A
LATIN INSCRIPTION.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
In Latin inscription translates as:
"In the name of God, open this
door."
19.

And then a look of confusion washes over Van Helsing's face.
In the corner of the cloth is an INSIGNIA in the shape of a
DRAGON. Van Helsing holds his hand up next to the insignia.
On Van Helsing's hand is a RING with the exact same DRAGON
INSIGNIA. The Cardinal sets his hand on Van Helsing's arm,
fatherly.

CARDINAL JINETTE (CONT'D)
I think that in Transylvania, you
may find the answer you seek. .. .

On Van Helsing's look WE CUT TO:
INT. ARMORY - DAY

Van Helsing strides through a huge blast of steam. An
extremely earnest little Friar scurries up, this is CARL.

CARL
There you are. Did you bring him
back? Or did you kill him?

Van Helsing doesn't even slow down. Carl shakes his head.

CARL (CONT'D)
You killed him, didn't you? That's
why they get so annoyed. When they
ask you to bring someone back, they
don't mean as a corpse.

Van Helsing scowls under his breath. Carl smiles.

CARL (CONT'D)
Ah! Right. You're in a mood. Well,
come on, I've got a few things that
will put the bit back in your
mouth.

Van Helsing is suddenly attracted to some swords coming out
of a flaming forge. Carl grabs him and pulls him away.

CARL (CONT'D)
Any idiot can make a sword.

A huge, beefy, Buddhist Monk covered in sweat steps out from
behind the forge, staring daggers at Carl.

CARL (CONT'D)
Sorry, father!

Carl grabs some items off a shelf and stuffs them into Van
Helsing's arms:
20.

CARL (CONT'D)
Rings of garlic, holy water, a
wooden stake, a silver crucifix ...

Van Helsing watches some Spanish priests fire a Gatling gun.

VAN HELSING
Why can't I use one of those?

Carl looks at Van Helsing like he's talking to a child.

CARL
You've never gone after vampires
before have you?

VAN HELSING
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same, best when
cooked well.

CARL
They are not all the same. A
vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

VAN HELSING
Carl, you've never even been out of
the abbey, how do you know about
vampires?

CARL
That's why they make books.

He gestures to a collection of manuscripts by Socrates,
Copernicus, Da Vinci, and Galileo, then steps up to a glass
OVEN where sticks of dynamite are dripping sweat into vials.

CARL (CONT'D)
Here's something new. Glycerine 48.

Carl sticks his pinky into a vial and then flicks a drop of
the dynamite sweat against a wall, the drop bursts into a
large ball of flame. Several of the startled clergy YELL OUT:

SEVERAL PRIESTS
Knock it off, Carl!

CARL
Sorry! Sorry!
(aside to Van Helsing)
The air around here is thick with
envy.
21.

Carl grabs a strange-looking CROSSBOW :and hands it to Van
Helsing, it's covered in little iron pumps and copper tubes.

CARL (CONT'D)
This is my latest invention.

VAN HELSING
Now this I like.

CARL

Gas propelled, capable of
catapulting bolts in rapid
succession at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

(he adjusts the sight)
I've heard the stories coming out
of Transylvania, trust me, you'll
need this. A work of certifiable
genius.

VAN HELSING
If you don't say so yourself.

Carl doesn't get sarcasm.

CARL
I did say so myself.
(earnest, not bragging)
I am a veritable cornucopia of
talent.

Van Helsing picks up a very odd-looking CONTRAPTION.

VAN HELSING
Did you invent this?

CARL
I've been working on that for
twelve years. It's compressed magma
from Mount Vesuvius with pure
alkaline from the Gobi Desert. It's
one of a kind.

VAN HELSING
What's it for?

CARL
I have no idea, but I'm sure it
will come in handy.

Carl scurries on as Van Helsing follows.
22.

VAN HELSING
Twelve years and you don't know
what it does?

CARL
I didn't say that. I said I don't
know what it's for. What it does is
create a light equal to the
intensity of the sun.

VAN HELSING
And this will come in handy how?

Carl hefts two huge duffle bags filled with weaponry into Van
Helsing's arms.

CARL
I don't know. You could blind your
enemies. Charbroil a herd of
charging wildebeest. Use your
imagination.

VAN HELSING
No, Carl, I'm going to use yours,
that's why you're coming with me.

CARL
The hell be damned if I am.

VAN HELSING
(points an accusing
finger)
You cursed. Not very well, but
you're a monk, you're not supposed
to curse at all.

CARL
Actually, I'm still just a friar, I
can curse all I want ... damn it.

VAN HELSING
The Cardinal has ordered you to
keep me alive ...

He shoves the huge duffle bags into Carl's arms.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
... for as long as possible.

Van Helsing turns and heads off through the flaming forges.
Carl, carrying the huge duffle bags, staggers off after him.
23.

CARL
But I'm not a field man!

A blast of STEAM fills FRAME, and then the CAMERA is suddenly
flying through CLOUDS ....

EXT. TRANSYLVANIA - GLOOMY DAY

The CAMERA rips out of the clouds and dives down between two
craggy mountain peaks, revealing the strange village of
VASERIA nestled in the heart of a creepy valley. The CAMERA
whips down into the village and crests the rooftops, as it
lands next to a chimney, three WHITE WINGS drop down around
it and TRANSFORM into familiar gowns. The CAMERA holds on the
village square below, bustling with activity. Aleera trembles
with anticipation.

ALEERA
(Romanian - subtitled)
I am very, very excited about this.

Marishka pours.

MARISHKA
(Romanian - subtitled)
Why can't we just let the Werewolf
kill her?

Verona gives her a condescending look.
VERONA
Never trust a man to do a woman's
job.
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Wearing hoods, heads down, Van Helsing and Carl move through
the vicious-looking crowd. Carl whispering to Van Helsing.

CARL
++. SO you can remember everything
about your life from the last seven
years, but nothing before that?

VAN HELSING
Not now, Carl.

Van Helsing's keen eyes are busy casing the locals.

CARL
There must be something?
24.

VAN HELSING
(dead serious)
I remember fighting the Romans at
Masada.

CARL
That was in 73 A.D.?

VAN HELSING
You asked.

Carl suddenly notices what Van Helsing has already taken in,
the villagers have been sneaking suspicious glances at them.

CARL
What are we doing here? Why is it
so important to kill this Dracula
anyway?

VAN HELSING
Because he's the son of the devil.

CARL
I mean besides that.

VAN HELSING
Because if we kill him, anything
bitten by him or created by him
will also die.

CARL
I mean besides that.

Van Helsing gives him a look. Top Hat steps up to them.

TOP HAT
Welcome to Transylvania.

All the villagers suddenly have knives, machetes, and
pitchforks in their hands, and they're all staring at Van
Helsing and Carl. Carl nervously whispers to Van Helsing.

CARL
Is it always like this?

VAN HELSING
Pretty much.

A pair of RIDING BOOTS step up onto the well in front of
them. It's Anna, she gestures to the two men.

ANNA
You! Let me see your faces.
25.

Under the hat, we see Van Helsing's eyes taking her in.

VAN HELSING
Why?

ANNA
Because we don't trust strangers.

VAN HELSING
I don't trust anyone.

Top Hat pulls out a measuring tape and starts measuring Carl.

TOP HAT

Strangers never last long here.
ANNA

Gentlemen, you will now be

disarmed..

Several village men move forward. Van Helsing glares at them.

VAN HELSING
You can try.

The men stop in their tracks, their resolve ~ wavering in his
glare.

ANNA
You refuse to obey our laws?

VAN HELSING
The laws of men mean little to me.

ANNA
Fine.
(she looks out at the
crowd)
Kill them.

All the villagers raise their weapons and start to close in.

VAN HELSING
I'm here to help you.

ANNA
I don't need any help.

VAN HELSING
Really?
26.

Van Helsing whips the crossbow out from behind his back, the
bow snaps out aimed right at Anna. Anna reacts and ducks,
REVEALING the three brides flying in formation right behind
her, coming right at her.

The brides are now HUGE, WHITE VICIOUS BATS FROM HELL, we
know it's the brides because their faces are very distinct
within the composition of the creatures.

Van Helsing fires. Three bolts. The brides split up as the
bolts whiz past, just missing them. The white spectres swoop
up over the rooftops and around the Byzantine church spire.

VILLAGERS
Nosferatu! !

All hell breaks loose. The bats rocket around the square,
ripping doors and shutters off their hinges, blowing tables
and chairs end-over-end, throwing people ass-over-teacups.

ANNA
Everybody inside!

Van Helsing keeps firing, trying to get a bead on them.
Aleera swoops down, heading for Anna. Anna sees her coming
and leaps off the well, right onto Van Helsing, they crash to
the ground. Van Helsing looks at Anna sprawled across him.

VAN HELSING
Normally, I don't like women who
throw themselves at me ....

Anna is suddenly ripped up off of him by Marishka. Van
Helsing bounds up onto the well, leaps out and grabs Anna.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Thought you said you didn't need
any help.

The two of them drop free and hit the ground. Anna lands on
Van Helsing, her thighs straddling his face. He grabs her and
rolls her to the ground.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Stay here.

She grabs him and rolls him to the ground.
ANNA

You stay here. They're trying to
kill me.
27.

Anna instantly leaps up and runs. Van Helsing gets up to go
after her, then spots his crossbow through the trampling
crowd. Verona and Marishka fly up over the rooftops.

VERONA
Marishka, my dear, please kill the
stranger.

MARISHKA
Love to.

Van Helsing grabs his crossbow and spins around to see Aleera
and Verona flying through the chaos, tossing peasants out of
their way, chasing Anna. Van Helsing dashes across the
square, he fires again, sending Aleera scattering.

VAN HELSING
Carl! I'm out!

Carl races forward, pulls out a clip and throws it to Van
Helsing. Van Helsing catches it just as Marishka swoops in on
him. Van Helsing dives to the ground in the nick of time.
Marishka’s clawed feet end up grabbing a cow, she lifts it
into the air and pitches it through a second-story balcony.

Van Helsing leaps up, slams the clip home and spins to see
Anna racing across the far side of the square, Verona still
on her tail. Van Helsing shoulders the crossbow and fires,
multiple bolts, rapid fire, tremendous velocity. Dozens of
arrows rip into the storefronts all around Verona and Anna.
Anna leaps over some crates as Verona swoops over her, just
missing her. Verona grabs a running man and lifts him up into
the air. The man screams in horror. Verona just smiles.

VERONA
Be happy in the knowledge that your
blood shall keep me beautiful.

Verona bites into his neck. Top Hat cackles at this from
behind a rack of coffins. Anna leaps up from behind the
crates, dozens of arrows are imbedded everywhere. Anna gives
Van Helsing an angry look.

ANNA
Who are you trying to kill?!

The whole square suddenly goes dead quiet. The brides are
nowhere in sight. All the villagers are hunkered down,
looking around. Van Helsing gives Anna a questioning look.
She nods upwards.

ANNA (CONT'D)
The sun.
28.

Van Helsing sees a sliver of SUN shining through the clouds.
Then he hears a loud SPLASH. He and Anna turn and look at the
well. They move in on it, weapons drawn. They peer into the
well. Above them, the clouds cover the sun. Carl reacts.

CARL
Van Helsing!

Too late. Aleera rockets up out of the well. Van Helsing is
blown back as Aleera grabs Anna and flies up into the air.
Van Helsing leaps up and aims, but he can't get a clear shot.

Anna’s boots skim the rooftops. She reaches down with her
free hand, withdraws a SWITCHBLADE from an ankle strap,
flicks it open and slashes Aleera’s ankle. Aleera SHRIEKS
with a mouth filled with fangs, then throws Anna into the
air. Verona swoops in and grabs her. The blade goes flying.

Van Helsing tracks the huge bat with his crossbow, then fires
a single shot. The lone arrow impales Verona’s foot, she
SHRIEKS in pain and rage. Anna drops free, falls onto a
rooftop and tumbles down. She manages to grab a gutter forty
feet up and dangle precariously. She leaps off the roof,
flips through the air, lands upside down on the side of a
tree, then jumps the rest of the way to the ground and runs
like hell. And that's when Carl sees something.

CARL (CONT'D)
Van Helsing! Two o'clock!

Van Helsing pivots in time to see Marishka coming right at
him. He fires. A half dozen bolts peg into Marishka. She
spirals wildly across the square and crashes straight through
the side of a building.

INT. VILLAGE HOME - DAY

Anna sprints into a house, slams the door shut, bolts it
tight and turns to go. Aleera's face is right in front of
her, dangling upside down from a ceiling beam, she licks her
bleeding ankle and smiles coquettishly.

ALEERA
Do you know how long I have wanted
to kill you?

Anna is clearly afraid, but trying to hide it as she slowly
backs away.

ANNA
Aleera, did I do something to you
in a past life?
29.

Aleera flips off the beam and lands between Anna and the
door. Anna backs away into the living room as Aleera closes
in for the kill.

ALEERA
Don't play coy with me, Princess,
you're just like all the other
pretty little ancestors in your
family. Saying you want to destroy
my master, but I know what lurks in
your lusting heart.

ANNA
I hope you have a heart, Aleera,
because someday I'm going to drive
a stake through it.

Aleera throws a casual UPPERCUT, launching Anna like a rag-
doll through a closed window.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Anna crashes through the shattering window, lands catlike on
the ground, and launches herself down an adjacent alley.

EXT. SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing and Carl creep towards the building that Marishka
crashed though. From inside they can hear sobbing.

MARISHKA (0.S.)
My face, look what you've done to
my face ...

Van Helsing slowly moves towards the building, crossbow
shouldered. The front door suddenly blows open. Marishka
blasts out and BACKHANDS Van Helsing fifty feet through the
air. His crossbow goes flying.

Marishka wings around the square, arrows imbedded in her
chest and face. Carl dives out of her way as she rips the
arrows our, one by one, then lands on a balcony and
TRANSFORMS back into a beautiful girl. Van Helsing rolls over
in time to see Marishka's wounds COMPLETELY HEAL. Carl leaps
up.

CARL
This should do the trick!

Van Helsing looks at him. Carl throws a familiar steel and
glass bottle.
30.

CARL (CONT'D)
Holy water!

The bottle flips through the air, Verona suddenly swoops in
and snatches it. She throws it into the well and looks at
Marishka.

VERONA
Finish him.

Then she flies off. Marishka looks at Van Helsing and smiles.

MARISHKA
Too bad. So sad.

Van Helsing looks over at THE CHURCH. WE CRASH ZOOM across
the square to a TIGHT SHOT of a basin of Holy Water. Then WE
WHIP PAN onto Marishka, she looks from the Holy Water to Van
Helsing. His eyes. Her eyes. Both of them are gearing up.

INT. PUB - DAY

Anna careens into a pub and skids to a stop. Aleera is
casually sipping a glass of very red wine. A man lies dead
across the bar next to her. Anna spins around, but Verona is
now right behind her.

VERONA
Hello, Anna, my dear.

She starts to move in for the kill. Anna stumbles back into a
wall, cornered.

ANNA
You won't have me, Verona.

Verona just smiles pleasantly and licks her lips.

VERONA
The last of the Valerious.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing looks at his crossbow, half way between him and
Marishka. Marishka leaps up onto the balcony railing, her
arms out, ready to take flight, daring him to make the first
move. Van Helsing goes for it. Racing for the crossbow.
Marishka leaps out and TRANSFORMS into a huge bat. Van
Helsing dives and rolls as Marishka swoops over him. Van
Helsing leaps up with his crossbow.
31.

EXT. PUB DAY

Verona opens her mouth, her canines distend into horrible
fangs. Anna throws a punch. Verona grabs her hand, lightning
quick, and forces Anna to her knees. Aleera steps up.

ALEERA
I want first bite.

Verona nods her consent. Aleera bends down for the kill.
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing runs like hell for the church. Marishka plunges
down into the square, laughing wildly. Van Helsing makes it
to the basin and slams the tips of his arrows into the water.
Marishka rockets right at his back, claws and fangs extended.
Van Helsing spins and FIRES. Bolts from the crossbow strafe
into the rocketing bat, only this time Marishka SHRIEKS
horribly, accompanied by the sound of sizzling flesh. She
spirals up and SLAMS into the middle of the church spire.

INT. PUB - DAY

Verona and Aleera both SCREAM. Anna is blown across the pub
by a shock wave of wind as the brides become bats.

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Van Helsing pivots as the two spectres crash up through a
rooftop and fly into the air, he aims to fire, but they
quickly fly off, WAILING insanely. Van Helsing steps back
from the church and looks up.

The dying bat is pinned to the spire by the arrows in it's
chest. The crowd goes quiet, staring up as the hellish thing
slowly TRANSFORMS back into a gorgeous young girl. Marishka
glares down at Van Helsing and hisses, then DECAYS into
molten rot, shrieking all the way.

Carl looks over and notices the cow, standing on the second
floor balcony, looking confused.

As the villagers crawl out from under all the wreckage, some
of them start pointing accusing fingers at Van Helsing

VILLAGERS
He killed a bride. He killed
Marishka! He killed a vampire!

Now Carl is confused.
32.

CARL
Isn't that a good thing?

Top Hat steps up with an amused smile.
TOP HAT
The vampires only kill what they
need to survive, one or two people

a month. Now they will kill for
revenge.

The angry villagers move in with their pitchforks and
machetes. Carl looks back at Van Helsing.

CARL
Are you always this popular?

VAN HELSING
Pretty much.

Top Hat smiles politely and tips his hat at Van Helsing.
TOP HAT
And what name, my good sir, do I
put on your gravestone?

And that's when Anna steps up.

ANNA
His name is Van Helsing.

A MURMUR washes over the Transylvanian crowd, but unlike with
the French, it is in admiration, not fear.

VILLAGERS
Van Helsing... It's Van Helsing...

Anna gives Van Helsing a nod.

ANNA
Your reputation precedes you.

Van Helsing gives her a hard look back.
VAN HELSING
Next time, stay close, you're no
good to me dead.

Anna is momentarily ruffled by this, then she laughs.
33.

ANNA
Well, I'll say this for you, you've
got courage.
(she turns to the crowd)
He's the first one to killa
vampire in over a hundred years!

She gives the handsome rogue an appraising look.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I'd say that's earned him a drink.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA TOWER - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a DRAGON INSIGNIA, like the one on Van Helsing's
ring. Carved into an open COFFIN covered in snow and ice. The
snow and ice suddenly melt into STEAM as Dracula rises up out
of it.

DRACULA
MARISHKAAA-!!

We are deep in the bowels of a thirteenth-century fortress.
It's like nothing we've ever seen before. Everything is
covered in a thick permafrost. Great icicles hang down from
the ceiling. Icy stalagmites rise up from the floor.

With weird, feral movements, Dracula jerks himself out of his
coffin and walks up an enormous pillar. As he passes ancient
candelabras, the candles mysteriously ignite.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
If it's not the Christians, it's
the Moors! Why can't they just
leave us alone. We never kill more
than our fill. And less than our
share. Can they say the same?

Dracula walks UPSIDE DOWN across the forty-foot-high ceiling.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Did I not say how important it was
to finish with these Valerious.

He comes face-to-face with Verona and Aleera, hanging from a
beam by their feet, cradled in each others arms, sobbing.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Now that we are so very close to
fulfilling our dream?
34.

The brides wail in anguish, Dracula's demeanor changes on a
dime, from anger to sympathy.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
There, there, my lovelies. Do not
worry, I shall find another bride.

The brides are appalled.

ALEERA
Do we mean so little to you!?

VERONA
Have you no heart!

DRACULA
No! I have no heart. I feel no
love. Nor fear, nor joy, nor
sorrow. I am hollow! Soulless! At
war with the world and every living
soul in it! ... But soon ... very
soon, the final battle will begin.

His demeanor changes on a dime again, he smiles curiously.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
I must find out who our new visitor
is.

Dracula jumps the forty feet to the ground with ease. The
huge SHADOW of a Werewolf prowls across the wall behind him,
a chain around its neck. Dracula smiles at it.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
We'll have to make a special
aperitif out of him. We are much
too close to success to be
interrupted now.

Both brides immediately panic and leap off their perch, drop
the forty feet and land next to Dracula.

ALEERA
No, my lord! Please! Say you won't
try again!

VERONA
My heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again.

DRACULA
SILENCE-!!
35.

The brides cower in fear. Dracula is immediately horrified,
as if he hurt a little child, he envelops them in his cape.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
No, no, no. Do not fear me, you

must not fear me, everyone else
fears me.

The brides calm down and begin to purr in his grasp.

DRACULA (CONT'D)

But we must try ... we have no
choice but to try .... For our own
survival.

Dracula inhales, smelling his brides, but his reverie is
broken by the roar of the Werewolf. Behind them, the
werewolf's shadow is being poked by a long stick held by a
HUNCHBACK'S SHADOW; the poking is accompanied by the sound of
electric shocks.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Igor!

The creepy hunchback himself scurries up, slipping across the
ice, carrying a ten-foot-long electric cattle prod.

IGOR
Yes, Master!
DRACULA
Why do you torment that thing so?
IGOR
It's what I do.
DRACULA
Remember Igor, "Do unto others."
IGOR
Yes, Master, before they do unto
me.
DRACULA
Now go.

Dracula looks up into the rafters.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
All of you!
36.

A large gang of vile little DWERGI are perched along the
beams. German Gothic trolls, short and squat, with weird
masks and goggles that completely hide their faces.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
To Castle Frankenstein!

INT. VALERIOUS MANOR ARMORY - NIGHT

A huge door is thrown open, revealing the Valerious ARMORY.
Four centuries' worth of nasty weaponry in cases and racks.
Anna charges in, a woman on a mission.

ANNA
So how did you get here?

CARL
We came across the Sea.

ANNA
Really? The sea? The Adriatic Sea?

Van Helsing is all business.

VAN HELSING
Where do I find Dracula?

ANNA
He used to live in this very house,
four centuries ago, no one knows
where he lives now.

She gestures to a huge oil PAINTING covering an entire wall,
a rich and fantastical MAP OF TRANSYLVANIA.

ANNA (CONT'D)
My father would stare at that for
hours looking for Dracula's lair.

Anna grabs a sword, an iron mace, and some throwing stars.

ANNA (CONT'D)
So that's why you've come?

VAN HELSING
I can help you.

ANNA
No one can help me.

VAN HELSING
I can try.
37.

ANNA
You can die trying. All of my
family has. I can handle this
myself.

VAN HELSING
(wry sarcasm)
So I noticed.

Anna spins on him, angry.

ANNA
The vampires attacked in daylight,
they never do that. I was
unprepared. It won't happen again.

VAN HELSING
Why did they attack in daylight?

ANNA
Clearly they wanted to catch me off
guard. They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

VAN HELSING
Why is that? Why now?

ANNA
You ask a lot of questions.

VAN HELSING
Usually I ask only two, what are we
dealing with, and how do I kill it?

Anna straps on a metal chest plate and spiked gauntlets.

ANNA
My father spent most of his life
looking for answers, year after
year,
(gestures out the window)
tearing apart that tower, combing
through the family archives.

On that, Van Helsing looks at Carl, admiring the weaponry.

VAN HELSING
The tower. Start there.

CARL
Right.

Van Helsing keeps staring at Carl. Carl looks confused.
38.

CARL (CONT'D)
Now?

Van Helsing doesn't even bother to respond. Carl quickly
heads out.

CARL (CONT'D)
Right. The tower. Now.

Anna grabs a scabbard, straps it on and heads for the swords.
Van Helsing blocks her path.

VAN HELSING
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive until Dracula is
killed.

ANNA
And who will kill him if not me?
Who will show courage, if not me?

VAN HELSING
If you go out there alone, you'll
be outmanned and out-positioned.
(gestures out a dark
window)
And you can't see in the dark.

Anna laughs this off and moves forward. Van Helsing closes
the gap between them, inches from her eyes.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
In the morning, we'll hunt him
together.

Anna stares up into his dark eyes.

ANNA
Some say you're a murderer, Mister
Van Helsing, others say you're a
holy man, which is it?

VAN HELSING
A bit of both, I think.

A slight smile creases Anna's beautiful face.

ANNA
I promised you a drink. The bar is
down the hall, help yourself. As
for me ...
(her eyes go dark)
I'm going.
39.

Anna grabs a sword and slams it into her scabbard. Van
Helsing watches her.

VAN HELSING
I'm sorry you have to carry this
burden.

ANNA
On the contrary, I would wish for
it no other way.

And she means it. She grabs a vicious-looking helmet, black-
on-black with sharp metal flanges. Van Helsing stares at her
respect for her growing.

She turns

She slams
grabs her
her face.
grabs her

VAN HELSING
And I'm sorry about your father and
brother.

ANNA
I will see them again.

to Van Helsing, her convictions rock solid.

ANNA (CONT'D)
We Transylvanians always look on
the brighter side of death.

VAN HELSING
There's a brighter side of death?

ANNA
Yes, it's just harder to see.

her helmet on and starts to charge out. Van Helsing
arm, spins her around and blows a blue powder into
Anna falls back into a wall, out cold. Van Helsing
in his arms before she falls to the floor.

VAN HELSING
I'm sorry about that too.

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - RAINY NIGHT

Manor Valerious spikes up into the dark sky, where menacing
clouds roil across a FULL MOON. The MUSIC tells us we're
building to something very scary.
40.

INT. ANNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna is waking up on her bed, her clothes are on, but her
armor and weapons have been removed. She suddenly sits up and
CURSES in ROMANIAN, then leaps out of bed.

ANNA
Oh my god that hurts ...
(then she gets angry)
That son-of-a-bitch.

She leaps out of bed and storms for the door.
EXT. GRAND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Except for the RAIN splattering against the windows and the
ominous music, it's quiet, very quiet, as Anna storms down
the hall. Suddenly, something CREAKS. Anna freezes. The sound
came from behind a door. Anna opens it and enters.

INT. VALERIOUS ARMORY - NIGHT
Anna steps into the armory and angrily looks into the dark.

ANNA
Van Helsing!?

Another CREAK. Coming from somewhere in the cases. Anna is
suddenly on the alert, her eyes scan the gloom. She grabs a
lantern out of a sconce and moves into the racks. Another
CREAK. Anna stops and cocks the lantern back, whoever it is,
she's going to let them have it. Then she moves on, and then
slowly peaks around a corner. It's just an open window, the
wind and rain forcing the shutter to creak against the wall.

Anna breathes a sigh of relief. Steps over and closes the
window, the FULL MOON glows outside. And then she sees WET
PAW PRINTS on the floor, her breath hitches. Her eyes follow
the paw prints, which vanish out in the middle of the floor.

HIGH ANGLE POV: A single eerie musical note signals the
presence of something evil, looking down on Anna. Anna
instantly knows she's in trouble, starts backing away,
breathing harder, she grabs a spiked mace. The POV slowly
glides across the ceiling, following her.

Anna feels the presence, but she doesn't know where it's
coming from, she spins around. Nothing's there. She moves on,
quicker now, weaving through the cases of weaponry. Then she
hears a LOW GROWL and freezes, trapped in the middle of the
armory, she cocks her arm back. A long terrifying beat.
4l.

And then a single drop of rain drops down onto her cheek.

Anna looks straight up. It's a Werewolf Fangs. Claws. Fur.
Dripping wet. Dangling from a beam above her, staring down.
It ROARS. Anna runs like hell, past a window. WE HOLD on the
window to see dark clouds completely cover the full moon.

Anna rounds a corner and slams into someone. She screams and
starts to swing the mace. VELKAN grabs her arm. Anna is
shocked.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Velkan! Oh my God! You're alive!

VELKAN
Quiet, Anna, I only have a moment.

ANNA
But Velkan, there's a Werewolf]

VELKAN
Never mind that! Listen to me! I
know Dracula's secret! He has
mumblich nowger lochen ...

Velkan has lost control of his mouth. And that's when Anna
notices that his clothes are torn to shreds. Anna recoils.
Velkan's body starts to spasm and jerk, he lurches STRAIGHT
UP THE WALL. He desperately forces his head to turn and look
out a window.

The roiling clouds suddenly clear and reveal the full moon.

VELKAN (CONT'D)
Anna! RUN!

But Anna is frozen in place, staring at her brother, ten feet
up the wall, who now TRANSFORMS into a Werewolf. The front
door bursts open. Van Helsing charges in. Guns drawn.

VAN HELSING
Annal!l?

The Werewolf looks out over the cases, sees Van Helsing enter
the room. The Werewolf throws itself through the balcony
doors. Shattered glass and rain scatter around Anna as Van
Helsing runs up.

VAN HELSING (CONT’D)
Are you alright?

She's too shocked to answer. He races out onto the balcony
and looks down.
42.

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - NIGHT

The Werewolf scampers horizontally across the side of the
manor. It leaps off, splashes down into the river and heads
into the village.

INT. VALERIOUS ARMORY - NIGHT

The armory door crashes open. Van Helsing spins back into the
room. It's Carl. He sniffs the air.

CARL
Why does it smell like wet dog in
here?

Van Helsing holsters his revolvers and strides for the door.

VAN HELSING
Werewolf

CARL
Ah! Right. You'll be needing silver
bullets then.

Carl scrounges around in his frock and pulls out a bandolier
filled with gleaming SILVER BULLETS. He tosses it to Van
Helsing, who catches it and slings it over his shoulder. Anna
snaps out of her shock and runs after Van Helsing.

ANNA
No. Wait!

Van Helsing slams the door shut behind him. We hear something
slam onto the opposite side. Anna runs up and struggles with
the door, but it's jammed tight. She is not a happy camper.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Van Helsing!

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

Van Helsing quietly stalks the labyrinthine streets of the
village, chambering rounds of silver bullets, on the hunt.
The only sound is the muffled revelry coming from pubs.

Van Helsing suddenly senses something and spins around, guns
up, scans the darkness, inhales deeply, then smiles.

VAN HELSING
Wet dog.
43.

A FLASH OF FUR suddenly explodes out of a distant alley, and
then in a blur of incredible speed, dodges back and forth
across the street, from doorway to doorway, getting closer
and closer, always hidden or one step ahead of Van Helsing's
gun barrels. It vanishes into an alley twenty feet in front
of him. Van Helsing starts to back away.

VAN HELSING (CONT’D)
Who's hunting who?

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Van Helsing spins around a corner and slams his back up
against a wall, waiting to be followed. Once again it's
quiet, too quiet. And then something slams into the wall
right next to him. Van Helsing whips his gun up into Top
Hat's face. The "something" that hit the wall was a coffin.
Top Hat smiles down the barrels, then tips his hat.

TOP HAT
Well look at that, a perfect fit,
what a coincidence.

He heads into the graveyard.

TOP HAT (CONT'D)
I see the wolf man hasn't killed
you.

VAN HELSING
Don't worry, he's getting to it.

Van Helsing follows, guns up and ready.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
You don't seem too worried about
him?

TOP HAT
Oh, I'm no threat to him, and I'm
the one who cleans up after him.

Top Hat sticks his shovel into a fresh grave.

TOP HAT (CONT’D)
If you get my meaning.

VAN HELSING
Little late to be digging graves,
isn't it?
44,

TOP HAT
Never too late to dig graves. Never
know when you'll need a fresh one.

Van Helsing hears something and turns around, his eyes scan
the darkness. Behind him, Top Hat raises his shovel and
swings it down at Van Helsing's head. Van Helsing spins
around and grabs it just before it smashes into his face. Top
Hat is terrified. Van Helsing is furious. Then Top Hat's eyes
swivel just a hair. Van Helsing sees it and ducks. The blur
of fur is exploding out of the darkness behind him.

Top Hat takes the full impact of the beast and is launched
sixty feet down the alley. He's dead even before he and the
Werewolf hit the light-post.

Van Helsing whirls around. Sees the dazed Werewolf stagger to
it's feet. Van Helsing's guns come up. He has the creature in
his sights. He squeezes the triggers.

ANNA (0.S.)
No!

Anna comes out of nowhere and knocks the guns up. They FIRE.
Blasting the light on the light-post. The Werewolf hauls-ass
around a corner. Van Helsing charges after it, races around
the corner in time to see the Werewolf dart off into the dark
forest. Anna runs up beside him. Van Helsing rums, grabs her
by the throat, and pins her to a wall, furious.

VAN HELSING
Why?

His grip is so tight she can't breath.

ANNA
You're ... you're choking me.

He loosens his grip only slightly.

VAN HELSING
Give me a reason not to.

Anna stares at him, the look in his eyes terrifies her, but
she still won't reveal what she knows.

ANNA
I can't .... If people knew ...

Van Helsing stares at her, then he lets her go. Anna grabs
her throat and sucks air. As his fury abates, Van Helsing
looks back at Anna.
45.

VAN HELSING
He's not your brother anymore,
Anna.

Anna looks at him, surprised.

ANNA
You knew?

VAN HELSING
I guessed.

ANNA
Before or after I stopped you from
shooting him?

VAN HELSING
Before.

Now it's Anna's turn to be furious.

ANNA
And still you tried to kill him?

VAN HELSING
He's a werewolf He's going to kill

people.

ANNA
He can't help it. It's not his
fault!

VAN HELSING
I know, but he'll do it anyway.

ANNA
Do you understand forgiveness?

VAN HELSING
I ask for it often.

ANNA
They say Dracula has a cure. If
there's a chance I can save my
brother, I'm going after it.

She starts to storm off. Van Helsing's arm shoots out and
stops her.

VAN HELSING
I need to find Dracula.
46.

ANNA
And I need to find my brother! He
gave his life for me! He's the only
family I have left!

Anna looks at him, tears in her eyes, heartbroken.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I despise Dracula more than you can
ever imagine, he has taken
everything from me, leaving me
alone in this world.

She slumps back against the wall, drained. Van Helsing's face
softens, an understanding coming to him.

VAN HELSING
To have memories of those you loved
and lost, is perhaps harder than to
have no memories at all.

He shakes his head with a sigh, then lowers his arm.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
All right, let's look for your
brother.

EXT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

Strangled by a thick mesh of vines and creepers, Castle
Frankenstein has somehow grown even more ominous over the
last six months. The sky swirls with dense clouds. Lightning
flashes. Thunder cracks. But inside, all is dark and quiet.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

A little, gloved Dwerger HAND slams a huge switch down. The
laboratory sparks to life. Brilliant arcs of electricity
shoot up and down the walls. The massive dynamos, generators,
gears, and fan belts kick in. The Dwergi are feverishly
preparing the equipment. A flash of lightning attracts
Dracula to the shattered skylight.

DRACULA
Igor!

Igor looks down from the skylight, rain lashing his twisted
little body, heavy wind practically blowing him off his feet.

IGOR
Yes, Master?!
47.

DRACULA
Have you finished?

IGOR
Yes, all is done! We're coming down
to make the final attachments!

DRACULA
Good.

The Werewolf glides in through a fissure in me granite wall,
its eyes fixed on Dracula. Dracula purposefully ignores it.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon, so
hard to control.

The Werewolf TRANSFORMS back into Velkan, bent over in agony.
Dracula strides majestically past him.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
I send you on a simple errand, to
find out who our new friend is, and
you stop for a talk with your
sister.

VELKAN
Leave her out of this, Count! She
doesn't know your secret, and I am
soon to take it to my grave.

Dracula steps up to a filthy iron POD, form-fitted for a very
large human body. Inside the pod is a BURNT CORPSE.

DRACULA
Don't wish for death so quickly. I
intend for you to be quite useful.

VELKAN

I would rather die than help you.
DRACULA

Don't be boring, everyone who says

that dies.

Dracula unfastens the metal straps holding the corpse in.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Besides, tonight, after the final
stroke of midnight, you'll have no
choice but to obey me.
48.

He rips the corpse out of the pod and throws it down in front
of Velkan.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Look familiar?

Velkan stares at it, stricken.

VELKAN
Father.

Dracula grabs Velkan, lifts him up off his feet and slams him
into the pod. Igor barks orders at several of the Dwergi and
they quickly strap Velkan tight to the pod.

DRACULA
He proved useless. But I'm hoping
with Werewolf venom running through
your veins, you will be of greater
benefit.

Dracula grabs a rusty metal SKULLCAP and slams it down onto
Velkan's head. Wires and electrodes spring from the skullcap
and attach to the dynamos. Velkan struggles to the last.

VELKAN
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not!

EXT. FOREST/CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna are trotting their horses down a snowy
country lane, eyes scanning the forest and the road.

ANNA
For me, this is all personal, it's
about family and honor.

She looks over at Van Helsing, curious.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Why do you do it? This job of
yours, what do you hope to get out
of it?

VAN HELSING
I don't know, maybe some self-
realization.

ANNA
What have you got out of it so far?
49.

VAN HELSING
(thinks hard)
--. back pains.

Anna smiles. Van Helsing smiles back. And that's when they
both spot something on the ground. They halt their horses,
leap off and run to a spot on the road. Anna beats him to it,
her hand lifts up a long coarse hair.

ANNA
Werewolves only shed before their
first full moon. Before the curse
has completely consumed them ...

They look off into the distance. Castle Frankenstein looms
over the countryside lit up by lightning from without and
huge arcs of electricity from within. Van Helsing and Anna
quickly pull their horses towards a decrepit old barn next to
the castle.

ANNA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
I don't understand, the man who
lived here was killed a year ago
along with a hideous creature he
created.

VAN HELSING (0.S.)
That's when your father went
missing.

ANNA (0.S.)
Just after that.

They strap their horses to a post, then step across the snow
and up to the edge of the barn. Lightning flashes as they
look out at the castle past the battered front gate to the
spectacular arcs of electricity flashing out of the windows.

VAN HELSING
Vampires, werewolves, lightning in
winter, this truly is a nightmarish
place.

Anna just stares out at the hideous castle.

ANNA
I've never been to the sea.

Van Helsing looks at her, she doesn't return the look, lost
in thought, wistful.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I'll bet it's beautiful.
50.

Van Helsing feels for her. Anna starts for the front door,
Van Helsing grabs her and pulls her back.

VAN HELSING
There are those who go in through
the front door ...

He gestures as a flash of lightning reveals a dozen corpses
tangled in the foliage around the front door.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
--. and there are those who get to
live just a little bit longer.

He pulls her off towards the back of the castle.
INT. GOTHIC FOYER - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna creep down a huge Gothic foyer, their
boots quietly splash through brackish water covering the
floor. Suddenly, at the far end of the hall, something small
scurries past. Van Helsing lifts his shotgun tight to his
shoulder. Anna nods knowingly.

ANNA
Dwerger.

VAN HELSING
Dwerger?

ANNA
One of Dracula's servants. If you
get the chance to kill one, do it,
because they'd do worse to you.

VAN HELSING
Right.

Another little Dwerger steps into view. Van Helsing lowers
his shotgun to hip height. The Dwerger YELLS IN ROMANIAN up
to someone above him. Anna turns to Van Helsing, stricken.

ANNA
They're using my brother for some
sort of experiment.

VAN HELSING
Anna.
51.

ANNA
(desperate)
My brother is still battling the
sickness within him. There's still
hope.

Van Helsing grabs her, hushed:

VAN HELSING
Anna! There is no hope for your
brother, bur we can still protect
others by killing Dracula.

She stares at him, filled with fury and desperation and
sorrow. Van Helsing's sympathetic eyes pierce into her.
Thunder rumbles.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

LIGHTNING FLASHES as the Dwergi move like monkeys around all
the equipment. Everything is starting to accelerate. Dynamos
CRACKLE. Pulleys WHIRL. Electrical arcs FLASH. Dracula turns
a flywheel. The pod with Velkan inside it rises up off the
floor, heading for the skylight high above.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

As Van Helsing and Anna come around a huge stone column their
faces fill with disgust. Hanging from the ceiling, rafters,
and beams are dozens of gooey white maggot-like COCOONS,
about the size of watermelons. DRIPPING SLIME.

VAN HELSING
You ever see these before?

Anna shakes her head, revolted.

ANNA
What do you think they are?

Van Helsing steps up to one and ponders it.

VAN HELSING
Offspring.

ANNA
What?

VAN HELSING
A man, with three gorgeous women,
for four hundreds years?
52.

He looks at Anna and cocks an eyebrow. Anna is shocked, she
looks out over the cocoons.

ANNA
Vampires are the walking dead, it
only makes sense that their
children are born dead.

Van Helsing checks out an electric wire sticking into the
cocoon, then notices wires sticking out of all the cocoons.

VAN HELSING
He must be trying to find a way to
bring them to life.

All the wires wend their way up the massive stairs and into
the flickering laboratory far above.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
I was told Dracula and his Brides
only kill one or two people a
month.

He snaps open his shotgun and smashes open a box of SHELLS.
TIGHT on the box of shells MARKED: SILVER NITRATE.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
If they bring all of these things
to life ...

He lets the thought finish itself and starts pumping shells
into the shotgun.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula steps up to a huge vat of neon green liquid, he slams
the hatch shut and dogs it tight.

DRACULA
Let us begin!

Igor and the Dwergi lower blast shields over their heads,

then clamber up the towering scaffolding to various power

stations. The weather is getting ferocious. Gusts of RAIN

whip down from the shattered skylight, backlit by blinding
LIGHTNING and accompanied by explosive THUNDER.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT
Van Helsing's fingers dig into one of the cocoons. He pulls

out a handful of the dreadful white goo and flings it to the
floor. He goes for another handful.
53.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Dracula spins around into a CLOSE UP:

DRACULA
Throw the switches!

EXT. CASTLE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod, then
courses through Velkan's body. Mercifully, we can't hear him
scream because one of the straps covers his mouth. A flash of
energy shoots down wires and into the castle.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

The flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires and
starts them jumping like scalded snakes. Van Helsing watches
this, then continues digging a hole in the cocoon, his hand
suddenly reveals the repulsive little humanoid face of a
PYGMY BAT. It has huge, creepy, lidless eyeballs covered in
veins, a hairy pig snout, mottled greenish skin, and a gaping
maw filled with rows of tiny, razor-sharp fangs. Even with
it's eyes open it's obviously lifeless. Anna looks sickened.

Another flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires.
And that's when the creepy little thing SNAPS TO LIFE and
HISSES. Anna SCREAMS. Van Helsing palms her mouth and pulls
her tight. All the cocoons begin PULSING with some sort of
repulsive inner life.

High above, Dracula, Verona, and Aleera stride out of the
flickering electrical light show and onto a balcony.

Van Helsing and Anna quickly back off into the darkness. A
third flash of energy rips down all the electrical wires. All
the cocoons begin QUIVERING WILDLY, shocked into animation.

The pygmy bat revealed by Van Helsing suddenly EXPLODES out
of it's cocoon. It darts up into the rafters. More cocoons
explode open, spraying walls and pillars with gooey white
slime. The putrid little things fly around the foyer. Their
CHITTERING becomes deafening. Dracula smiles at his Brides.

DRACULA
They must feed. Show them how.

Dracula shoves Aleera and Verona off the balcony.
DRACULA (CONT'D)

And beg the devil that this time
they stay alive!
54.

The two Brides drop through the air and then TRANSFORM into
giant bat form. They fly and cavort with their offspring.
Dracula points out the windows and YELLS to his spawn:

DRACULA (CONT'D)
You must feed! To the village! TO
THE VILLAGE!

Van Helsing whirls out into the foyer.

VAN HELSING
This is where I come in.

ANNA
No! Wait! You can't!

All the windows in the foyer suddenly SHATTER as the brides
and their winged vermin start to fly through them.

And that's when Van Helsing OPENS FIRE. Pumping controlled
bursts, the silver nitrate flashing weirdly. Several of the
hideous things are hit. They BURST INTO BLACK GOO.

Dracula looks down, insanely furious, all he can see is the
silhouette of a man in the foyer far below him. Van Helsing
slams his shotgun into a holster strapped across his back.

VAN HELSING
Now that I have your attention.

Needless to say, Dracula goes nuts. He screams in rage and
leaps off the eighty-foot-high balcony. Van Helsing sprints
hell-bent-for-leather back down the foyer. We don't get to
see what Dracula has transformed into, but the sound and fury
of his wings is tremendous, creating a huge wind that throws
everything around and almost knocks Anna off her feet as she
leaps our from behind a stone column and races up the
staircase, heading for the laboratory.

INT. TOWER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Valerious tower bedroom looks like it's been ransacked by
a librarian. Ancient artifacts, strange relics, and spiritual
texts are arranged symmetrically around a huge CANOPY BED. A

flicker of lightning illuminates Carl, wide-eyed as he reads

from an elaborately inscribed SACRED LATIN TEXT.

CARL
Well, that's interesting....
55.

And then he hears a horrible CHITTERING. Carl runs to a
window and looks out. From this distance, it looks like
flying monkeys winging their way over the dark countryside.
Carl stares in horror, then turns and runs out of the room.

INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN FOYER - NIGHT

Back in the foyer, the sound and fury and wind dissipate.
Then WE CUT TO Dracula's POV, a creepy blueish NIGHT-VISION,
scanning the foyer. Van Helsing is nowhere in sight. WE TRACK
a huge WINGED SHADOW across a wall, it transforms into the
shadow of a man. Dracula steps into FRAME.

DRACULA
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

He puts his hand to his ear, we can hear the sound of a
HEARTBEAT.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Usually when I approach I can
almost dance to the beat....
Strange that yours is so steady.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna withdraws her sabre as she creeps into the laboratory.
The Dwergi are frantically scurrying about. Igor yells above
the cacophony of the machinery and the weather.

IGOR
We're losing power! The human is
insufficient! Accelerate the
generators! Power the dynamos!

Anna notices the pod high above the shattered skylight.
Another bolt of lightning strikes it. One of Velkan's arms
suddenly breaks loose from the straps and flails wildly.

ANNA
Velkan.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

Several men and a comely BARMAID dash out of a pub and join
dozens of other peasants into the square, staring up into the
storm racked skies at the approaching winged vermin.

BARMAID
Oh my God. What do we do? What do
we do?
56.

Carl comes racing around the corner.

CARL
RUUUN!!

He grabs the Barmaid and yanks her out of frame as the
hideous creatures flock down into the square. Everybody runs
like hell. Some people are ripped up off their feet and
carried into the air, others are gang tackled and mauled by
the creatures. It's like a scene out of The Birds.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Dracula stalks through the arches. A phosphorescent match
suddenly IGNITES at his feet, he looks down. Van Helsing
drops out of a ceiling and STABS a wooden stake deep into his
chest. Dracula looks at the wooden stake in his chest, then
at Van Helsing, standing in a shaft of light. Dracula gives
him a rather pleasant smile.

DRACULA
Hello, Gabriel.

Van Helsing freezes. We've never seen him puzzled before.
Dracula calmly grabs the wooden stake in his chest, rips it
out and casually discards it.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna creeps across a catwalk, suddenly, she hears the SCREAM
of charging Dwergi, one to the left, one to the right. Anna
clamps her sword between her teeth and leaps out onto a
hanging rope. The two Dwergi leap out after her. All three of
them climb. The Dwergi getting closer and closer to Anna. One
of them grabs her boot. Anna grabs her sword and lashes down,
cutting the rope, both Dwergi plummet down into a vat of
boiling green liquid.

Igor and the other Dwergi are too busy to have noticed.

IGOR
We must not lose the Master's

progeny!
Anna sockets her sabre and keeps climbing.
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

Flying serenely above the scream-filled village, Verona’s
hideous fanged mouth smiles adoringly.

VERONA
Feed my lovelies! FEED!
57.

She lifts up a terrified man, dangling from her hand, then
chucks him out over the village. A swarm of pygmy bats swoops
in like piranha, grabbing him and tearing him apart.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT
A dawning realization washes over Dracula.

DRACULA
You don't remember, do you?

Suspicious, Van Helsing backs off into the ancient foyer.

VAN HELSING
Exactly what should I be
remembering?

Dracula follows him, like a cat toying with a trapped mouse.

DRACULA
You are the great Van Helsing.
Trained by monks and mullahs from
Tibet to Istanbul. Protected by
Rome herself! But like me...
(his face darkens)
.---ehunted by all others.

VAN HELSING
The Knights of the Holy Order know
all about you, so I guess it's no
surprise that you would know about
me.

DRACULA
Oh, but it's much more than that,
you and I go back a long way,
Gabriel. I know why you have such
horrible nightmares. The horrific
scenes of ancient battles past? Do
you know how you received those
triangular scars on your back?

Van Helsing's eyes narrow, now it's getting really strange.

VAN HELSING
--- how do you know me?

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna runs up to Velkan, who is still strapped into the pod.
She starts unbuckling the belts. Velkan's delirious eyes
finally notice her, a sudden clarity fills them, he starts
shaking his head and shoving her away with his free arm.
58.

ANNA
Stop, Velkan! Stop it! It's all
right. I've come to save you.

The CLOCK TOWER behind them begins to CHIME MIDNIGHT.
Velkan's hand grabs Anna’s mouth and starts to grow coarse
hair and horrific claws. Anna’s eyes practically bug out of
her head. She SCREAMS and tries to rip herself away.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT
Van Helsing hears Anna's scream. Dracula just smiles.

DRACULA
So, would you like me to refresh
your memory? A few details from
your sordid past?

Van Helsing rips a crucifix out of his cloak and thrusts it
at Dracula. Dracula SHRIEKS and angrily swats it away, then
calms down, smiling beatifically, as if nothing, had
happened.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
I guess that's a conversation for
another time. But before you go,
let me reintroduce myself
(bows majestically)
Count Vladislaus Dragulia. Born
1432. Murdered 1462.

His bicuspids distend into razor sharp fangs.
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

A third-story window bursts into shards of glass as a woman
leaps through it. Two pygmy bats fly out of the window behind
her and grab her inches before she hits the pavement.

Carl and the Barmaid come racing around a corner just as the
woman is flown up over their heads. Carl lets go of the
Barmaid and jumps up to try and save the woman, but she's too
high and the hideous vermin carry her off. And that's when
Carl hears a scream. He turns and looks.

The Barmaid is clinging to a light post six feet off the
ground, her legs are being yanked up by a pygmy bat. Carl
grabs a chair on the run and swings it into the creature. The
hideous thing is knocked away. The Barmaid drops into Carl's
arms. The creature quickly recovers and charges back for Carl
and the Barmaid. The Barmaid screams. Carl screams.
59.

The creature suddenly pulls up two feet short of killing
them, the look on its hideous face has gone from blood-lust
to panic, it frantically claws at its body and then BURSTS
INTO MOLTEN FLESH ROT.

HIGH ABOVE THE SQUARE: all of the pygmy bats BURST INTO
MOLTEN FLESH ROT. Several people are dropped to their deaths.

The two flying Brides freak out and start to SHRIEK.
INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Dracula spins around at the distant sound of his brides
WAILING. Van Helsing uses the moment to leap into a large
dumbwaiter and cut the cables with one of his saw blades.
Dracula looks back in time to see Van Helsing rocket upwards.

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Anna SCREAMS. Velkan looks at his hands,
eyes widening in horror, he gives his sister one last
pathetic look, and then TRANSFORMS into the Werewolf. Anna
quickly backs away and slams into another body. She screams
and spins around. It's Van Helsing.

VAN HELSING
I think we've overstayed our
welcome.

The fat gun in his hand FIRES. The tether shoots off across
the castle moat and slams into the top of a huge oak tree two
hundred yards away. Van Helsing quickly ties his end taut.

As the clock CHIMES, the Werewolf sits up in front of it.
Viciously tearing his way free, he heads for our two heroes.

Van Helsing scoops Anna up off her feet and leaps over the
wall just as the Werewolf rips the shotgun off his back.

Van Helsing and Anna start to rappel down the tether. The
Werewolf slashes it, severing it. Van Helsing and Anna are
suddenly swinging out over the moat and into the dark forest.

The Werewolf glares after them, filled with an incredible
fury as the clock hits the final stroke of midnight....

EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT
Carl and the Barmaid look around, confused.

BARMAID
What happened?
60.

CARL
They... they just died.

The Barmaid wraps her arms around Carl and kisses him of the
cheek.

BARMAID
How can I ever repay you?

Carl whispers into her ear. The Barmaid looks shocked.

BARMAID (CONT'D)
But you can't do that, you're a
monk.

CARL
Actually, I'm just a friar....

EXT. CASTLE TOWER - NIGHT

High atop the castle tower, Dracula cradles the sobbing
brides in his arms. Igor slithers up, looking terrified, if
he had a tail, it would be tucked firmly between his legs.

IGOR
I am sorry, Master. We try and we
try, but I fear we are not so smart
as Doctor Frankenstein.

Dracula turns to him.

DRACULA
Truly.

Igor cowers, but Dracula seems spent.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
It is clear that the good Doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

The Werewolf steps up onto the parapet, an insane look in
it's eyes. Dracula waves him away, dismissive.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Hunt them down. Kill them both.

The Werewolf gives him a deranged look and snarls evilly,
clearly he is Velkan Valerio us no more. He turns and leaps
off the parapet.
61.

EXT. MOORS - NIGHT

RAIN lashes down on Van Helsing and Anna as they stagger
across the moors, heading into the ruins of the old windmill.
With the loss of her brother, Anna doesn't know whether to
scream or cry, so she does both, and aims it at Van Helsing.

ANNA
A wooden stake?! A silver
crucifix?! What did you think?! We
haven't tried everything before?

Anna shoves Van Helsing back under one of the huge charred
windmill sails, a refuge from the rain.

ANNA (CONT'D)
We've been hunting this creature
for more than four hundred years.
We've shot him, stabbed him,
clubbed him, sprayed him with holy
water and staked him in the heart,
and still he lives!

Van Helsing just stares at her, fire fascinates him, fiery
women even more so. She gets right up into his face.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Do you understand?... Nobody knows
how to kill Dracula.

Their faces are inches apart. RAIN pours down on them. A
slight smile creases Van Helsing's lips.

VAN HELSING
I could've used that information a
little earlier.

Anna just scowls, breathing hard. Van Helsing's dark eyes
stare at her, he likes being this close to her. But she's too
upset.

ANNA
Don't give me that look. I don't
need your wolf's eyes undressing
me...

She shoves herself away and stares off into the rain.

ANNA (CONT'D)
++. not right now anyway.

Van Helsing picks up an undamaged absinthe bottle and admires
it. Anna looks at him, the fight going out of her.
62.

ANNA (CONT'D)
You were right ... I'm sorry ... he
isn't my brother anymore.

She steps up closer to him as he uncorks the bottle.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Do you have any family, Mister Van
Helsing?

VAN HELSING
I'm not sure. I hope to find out
someday, that's what keeps me
going.

Anna takes the bottle and holds it up in a toast.

ANNA
Here's to what keeps you going.

She takes a deep slug, clearly it has a bite.

VAN HELSING
Absinthe. Strong stuff

Anna hands him the bottle.

ANNA
Yes. Don't let it touch your
tongue, it'll knock you on your-

-And that's when the soggy ground beneath them suddenly CAVES
IN. The two of them and a load of timber drop into a rapidly
expanding breach in the ground.

INT. CAVERN - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna and a cascade of water and timber crash
down into a cavern and WE FADE OUT.

 

EXT. VILLAGE - DAWN
FADE UP: on the Transylvanian village at dawn.
INT. TOWER BEDROOM - DAY

Carl is asleep on a couch. He suddenly sits up, terrified,
then looks down and sees the sleeping Barmaid.

CARL
Ah! Yes ... now I remember.
63.

Carl leans back against the wall, triggering a secret panel
to swing open and reveal a PAINTING: a fantastic mural of two
medieval KNIGHTS facing each other atop a sea lashed cliff.
There is writing in Latin encircled around the two men. Carl
translates it:

CARL (CONT'D)
Even a man who is pure in heart,
and says his prayers by night, may
become a wolf when the wolf-bane
blooms, and the moon is shining
bright.

He steps up to get a closer look and finish the inscription.

CARL (CONT'D)
Or crave another's blood when the
sun goes down, and his body takes
to flight.

As soon as he finishes the last word, the entire painting
COMES ALIVE, trees sway, grass blows, huge waves pound the
cliff, the clock on a church tower begins to CHIME, and the
two knights TRANSFORM: one into a Werewolf, the other into a
Winged Beast from Hell. They viciously attack each other.

Carl of course freaks out, stumbles back, knocks the entire
couch over and lands on the Barmaid's semi-naked body. She
angrily shoves him off as he looks up at the painting. The
ancient painting is back to being just a painting, as if it
was all in his mind. He stares at it, perplexed, as his
Transylvanian girlfriend angrily gathers her clothes.

BARMAID
Friars, monks, priests, you're all
the same!
INT. CAVERN - DAY
Anna slowly wakes up on the dark cavern floor, groggy and
sore, she rubs her head and groans. A HAND quickly covers her
mouth. She looks up. Van Helsing's finger goes to his lips.
VAN HELSING
Shhh ... there's something down
here.
And it's carnivorous.

He gestures to a massive pile of RAT BONES, picked clean.

Anna gets to her feet. The cavern is lit by a very dim gloom
coming from tiny crevices in the roof.
64.

A fetid little stream wends its way through the cavern. Van
Helsing starts to head downstream. Anna draws her sword and
follows.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Whatever's down here appears to be
of human ancestry.

He gestures to a large set of muddy BOOT PRINTS.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
I'd say he's a size 17. About 360
pounds. 8 1/2 to 9 feet tall. He
has a bad gimp in his right leg....
And three copper teeth.

ANNA
How do you know he has copper
teeth?

VAN HELSING
Because he's standing right behind
you.

Van Helsing goes for his guns. Frankenstein's Monster leaps
out of the pitch blackness behind Anna and slams her into Van
Helsing. Our two heroes crash to the floor. Van Helsing's
revolver goes flying.

The monster is on Van Helsing in a flash he lifts him up over
his head and hurtles him into a rock wall. Van Helsing
bounces off the wall and slams to the floor. The monster
looks down at Anna. Anna gets a good look at him. He now
looks even more horrific than before, having been badly
burned so long ago.

ANNA
Oh my god, the Frankenstein
monster.

FRANKENSTEIN
MONSTER! ?

Frankenstein's VOICE is a horrible, guttural rasp.

FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
Who is the monster here?!?

He lifts Anna up off the floor.
FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)

I have done nothing wrong and yet
you and your kind all wish me dead!
65.

Van Helsing leaps up and tackles Frankenstein. Frankenstein's
head slams into a rock wall, the top half of his head pops
off. Van Helsing grabs him by the neck, the bolts SPARK, Van
Helsing is shocked back against the far wall, he crashes to
the floor, trying not to pass out from the pain.

Frankenstein slams the top of his head back into place, then
the top half of his body turns around and he heads for Anna.
Anna backs away, up against some burnt timber, looking
around, playing for time.

ANNA
What do you want?

Frankenstein stares down at her, his face growing mournful.

FRANKENSTEIN
To exist.

Van Helsing yanks an ivory BLOWGUN out from inside his cloak
and sticks it to his mouth.

Six blow-darts nail Frankenstein in the back. He bellows and
spins around, arms flailing at his back, trying to swat the

darts free. Anna runs over and picks up one of the revolvers
off the ground next to Van Helsing.

ANNA
We must kill it.

Van Helsing grabs her by the wrist.

VAN HELSING
No! Wait.

Frankenstein crashes to his knees, his bleary eyes look over
at them.

FRANKENSTEIN
If you value your lives, and the
lives of your kind, you will kill
me.

Van Helsing pulls Anna behind him and heads for Frankenstein,
whose breathing is getting more and more labored.

FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
If Dracula finds me I am the key to
my father's machine the key to
life, life for Dracula's children!
66.

VAN HELSING
He already awakened them, last
night.

FRANKENSTEIN
Those were just from one bride,
from one single birthing. And they
died as they did the last time he
tried. Only with me can he give
them lasting life.

Van Helsing kneels down beside Frankenstein.

VAN HELSING
There are more? More of those
things?

Frankenstein's pathetic eyes stare at him.

FRANKENSTEIN
Thousands ... thousands more.

Frankenstein passes out, crashing face first into the dirt.
WE PUSH IN on Van Helsing as the gravity of this hits him.
Anna isn't fazed, she lifts the gun and aims. Van Helsing
steps in front of her. She angrily looks him in the eyes.

ANNA
You heard what he said.

Van Helsing holds her stare, searching for the words ....

VAN HELSING

My life, my ... job... is to
vanquish evil. I can sense evil.

(gestures to Frankenstein)
This thing ... man ... whatever it
is, evil may have created it, left
its mark on it, but evil does not
rule it. So I cannot kill it.

ANNA
I can.

She moves around him. He blocks her path.

VAN HELSING
Not while I'm here.

Anna sees the intensity in his eyes. Behind them, hidden in
the shadows, is the Werewolf, staring at Frankenstein.
67.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Your family has spent four hundred
years trying to kill Dracula, maybe
this poor creature can help us find
a way.

The Werewolf slowly starts to back away. Van Helsing suddenly
senses it and spins around. He and Anna see the Werewolf's
shadow vanish down the cavern.

ANNA
Oh my God. He's seen us.
(she turns to Van Helsing)
Now they'll come for him. And
neither you or I will be able to
stop them.

Van Helsing grabs her arm and heads for Frankenstein.

VAN HELSING
I must get him to Rome. We can
protect him there.

On Anna's dubious look WE SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - DAY

STEAM blasts out of the nostrils of huge black horses,
covered in a light armor plating, coupled to an ornate COACH.
Van Helsing and Carl walk down alongside them.

CARL
--. and then the painting came
alive and the two creatures
attacked each other.

VAN HELSING
What does it mean?

CARL
I don't know.

Anna opens the door to the coach. Frankenstein is inside,
chained to the back wall. Van Helsing nudges Carl.

VAN HELSING
Whatever you do, don't stare at
him.
68.

CARL
I'm staring at him.
(quickly turns away)
Is that a man?

Van Helsing shoves Carl up into the seat across from
Frankenstein.

VAN HELSING
Actually it's seven men, parts of
them anyway.

Frankenstein struggles to break the chains that bind him.

FRANKENSTEIN
By exposing me, you have condemned
me. Me and all of humanity!

Anna slams the door shut and gestures to the horses.

ANNA
Nothing is faster than
Transylvanian steeds. Not even a
werewolf Anything else, you're on
your own.

COUNTRYSIDE - DAY/NIGHT TRANSITION

On the bottom half of the SCREEN, the coach races across the
countryside. On the top half, the sky is whipping past in
TIME LAPSE. Dark clouds scream by showing us glimpses of the
sun as it races right to left across the SCREEN. As the sun
exits FRAME the moon comes up and the TIME LAPSE ends
revealing an ominous night sky. The coach races into a dark
forest. Two Bride silhouettes fly past and follow it.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

The black steeds charge through the woods pulling the COACH.
Van Helsing is in the driver's seat urging them on.

INT. COACH - NIGHT
Frankenstein stomps his Doc Martens and yells out.
FRANKENSTEIN
Free me! Let me fight! Let me die!

But do not let me be taken alive!

Sitting across from him is Carl, eyes wide, really keyed up,
the blowgun stuck to his lips.
69.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

The CAMERA is suddenly hurtling through the misty forest at
about Mach 1. The BRIDE'S POV quickly closes in on the coach.

Van Helsing senses them coming, he looks around, the creepy
trees sway in the breeze, but he can't see the brides. He
hefts the crossbow. He hears something off to his left and
looks. And that's when Verona swoops down on his right and
grabs him jerking him clean off the driver's seat and up into
the air. The crossbow goes flying. Van Helsing quickly breaks
free and falls down onto the lead horse. He looks forward.

A hundred yards ahead, the path makes a hairpin turn next to
a giant precipice. Van Helsing quickly looks back at the
coach.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

The coach bounces hard. Frankenstein is thrown forward at
Carl. Carl screams, but the chains hold Frankenstein just
short of falling on him.

FRANKENSTEIN
Let me go.

CARL
Where are you going to go? I don't
know if you've looked in the mirror
lately, but you kind of stick our
in a crowd.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Van Helsing leaps from the front horse to the middle horse to
the rear horse and then up onto the buckboard. And that's
when Aleera nails him on the fly, throwing him back onto the
rear horse.

All of the horses try to make the turn, going full boar,
hoofs fighting to avoid slipping over the edge, kicking rocks
our into space. Van Helsing holds on for dear life. The coach
skids sideways, the couplings SNAP and the coach is flung out
over the void.

Van Helsing spins up into a saddle in time to see the coach
spiraling through the air, heading for the valley floor far
below.

EXT. IN THE AIR - NIGHT

HIGH UP IN THE AIR: Aleera and Verona freak out.
70.

VERONA
We must not let him be destroyed!

EXT. WOODS - CLIFF FACE - NIGHT

The two Brides fly as fast as they can towards the plummeting
coach. They both grab it, but its weight is far too great for
them to stop it from falling. Aleera is losing her grip.

ALEERA
Save him! Save the monster!

Aleera is blown off Verona struggles her way to the door, her
wings are being badly buffeted. She grabs the door and rips
it off, then looks inside. The coach is empty.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

BACK WITH VAN HELSING as ANOTHER COACH races out of the
forest and up to the six team. Anna in the driver's seat.
Carl leans out the window. Frankenstein is chained inside.

CARL
Come on! Come on!

INT. COACH - NIGHT

BACK INSIDE THE OTHER COACH: Verona sees a bunch of glycerine
tubes wrapped around a dozen SILVER SPIKES. Verona hisses in
anger and throws herself free of the coach.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

The coach hits the ground and EXPLODES. Several of the spikes
nail Verona in the chest. She shrieks in horror and then
TRANSFORMS back into herself. Losing her wings, she drops out
of the sky, DECAYING into molten rot, shrieking all the way.
Aleera screeches in horror.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Van Helsing leaps from the six team onto the buckboard of the
other coach, landing next to Anna. He gives Anna a nudge in
the ribs and a cocky smile, as if to say, "I told you it
would work." And that's when 800 pounds of enraged fur leaps
over the entire six team, heading right for Van Helsing and
Anna.
71.

Van Helsing quickly rolls off one way as Anna flings herself
off the other. The Werewolf slams into the buckboard and
skids sideways across the roof, shattering all four corner
lanterns. The Werewolf vanishes off the back of the coach as
the kerosene and the entire roof bursts into flames.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl frantically looks around, then sees Anna's face
plastered to the window.

ANNA
CARL!

Carl leaps over and opens the door.
EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Anna is hanging on to the side of the coach, which is now
skirting a huge precipice a mile deep. Carl grabs her as she
starts to slip.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COACH: Van Helsing is being
violently dragged down the road, desperately clinging by one
hand to the axle of the coach. His legs splitting the rear
wheel, if he lets go he'll be run over.

VAN HELSING
CARL!

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl looks past Frankenstein to the other side of the coach.
He can't let go of Anna or she'll fall. He looks at
Frankenstein. Frankenstein nods.

FRANKENSTEIN
I can help.

CARL
You won't kill me?

FRANKENSTEIN
Only if you don't hurry.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Van Helsing grimaces in pain, his five fingers cling to the
axle, then four fingers, then three, two, one. He lets go and
heads under the rear wheel. And that's when a huge fist grabs
him by the collar and pulls him free. It's Frankenstein.
72.

The two men share a look, then Frankenstein heaves Van
Helsing upwards. He lands on the buckboard just as Anna
swings up next to him.

INT. COACH - NIGHT

Carl looks at Frankenstein and smiles in relief, then he
screams bloody murder as he sees FUR moving across the rear
window. And then the roof splits open and fire and smoke
pours in. Now it's Frankenstein's turn to scream.

EXT. COACH - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna look back through the fire towards the
rear of the coach. In SLO-MO the Werewolf rises up through
the flames.

The side door of the coach smashes open and Frankenstein and
Carl look out.

FRANKENSTEIN
Don't look down.

CARL
I'm looking down! I'm looking down!

The coach makes it across the precipice road and enters the
forest. The Werewolf hunches. Van Helsing YELLS at Anna.

VAN HELSING
Jump !

Anna turns and leaps off the carriage. So does Carl and
Frankenstein. They all vanish into the lush forest.

Van Helsing aims both of his guns down at the coupling and
fires. The horses break loose of the carriage. Van Helsing
turns and jumps. The Werewolf leaps through the flames.

Van Helsing spins around in mid-air and fires his guns back
at the Werewolf just as it tackles him. They vanish into the
foliage. The flaming coach flips off the road, spirals
through the air and crashes into the trees. The six team
hauls-ass down the forest road, vanishing into the night ....

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT
Anna staggers through the forest, she rounds a tree, her

breath hitches. Lying naked on the ground is her brother. He
looks up and gives his sister one last sorrowful look.
73.

VELKAN
Forgive me.

And then he dies. Anna throws herself onto Velkan's body.

ANNA
Velkan! ... Velkan! ... Velkan.

She cradles him gently and kisses him on the cheek.

ANNA (CONT'D)
I will see you again.

Nearby, Van Helsing staggers to his feet. Anna looks at him,
then leaps up and charges him, pummeling him with her fists.

ANNA (CONT'D)
You killed him! You killed him!

Van Helsing grabs her by the wrists and holds her tight.

VAN HELSING
Now you know why they call me
murderer.

Anna looks into his eyes, they are not angry, but filled with
a profound sadness. And then Anna notices BLOOD on his shirt,
she gently opens his cloak. Anna gasps. Horrified.

ANNA
Oh my god ...

Van Helsing's shirt is punctured with bloody fang holes.

ANNA (CONT'D)
You've been bitten.

She staggers back and looks at him, she sees it in his eyes.
A hint of it anyway. Fear. Van Helsing turns and looks down
at Velkan's body. Anna turns away. Aleera is standing right
there. She backhands Anna.

Anna slams into a tree and drops to the ground, our cold. Van
Helsing spins around in time to catch a glimpse of Anna,
upside down, being yanked up into the trees. Van Helsing
hauls-ass.
74.

EXT. CLIFFSIDE - NIGHT

Van Helsing runs out onto the side of a cliff. He sees Anna
being carried off over the precipice by Aleera. Carl and
Frankenstein stagger up beside him. All three of them watch
the silhouettes of Anna and Aleera flying off towards the
lights of a distant city ....

EXT. BUDAPEST - DAY

Nestled in a lush valley and split in half by a dark river,
the city is sprinkled with churches, mosques, and palaces.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Van Helsing, Carl, and Frankenstein stagger down an alley.
Battered and bruised. Frankenstein's face is covered by a
hood. Van Helsing pulls his cloak tight, keeping his wound
hidden. A blast of wind hits them. They all react, Van
Helsing flinches in pain as he pulls his gun.

Perched on the snowy eve of a house is Aleera, she clicks her
tongue in disapproval.

ALEERA
Tch, tch, tch, so much trouble to
my Master, so much trouble.

Frankenstein starts to head for her. Van Helsing stays him.
Aleera just giggles.

ALEERA (CONT'D)

You killed Verona. If the Master

was capable of love, he would have

loved her very much. As for me ...
(she smiles coquettishly)

+.. now I will have the Master's

undivided attention.

VAN HELSING
What do you want?

ALEERA
The Master commands a trade. The
monster for the Princess.

Frankenstein glares at her angrily, and then he hears Van
Helsing's VOICE:

VAN HELSING (0.S.)
Somewhere public. Lots of people.
75.

Frankenstein looks at Van Helsing, feeling betrayed, his brow
furrows, his eyes darken. Van Helsing's eyes stay on Aleera.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
A place where your master will be
less inclined to expose his ...
other side.

Aleera chews this over for a moment, then her eyes light up.

ALEERA
Tomorrow night is All Hallow's Eve!
Here in Budapest there is a
wonderful masquerade ball.

She leaps for joy, all the way up to the top of the roof.

ALEERA (CONT'D)
I love masquerade balls!
(she looks down at them)
Vilkovia Palace. Midnight.

Then she whoops for joy and leaps again, vanishing over the
side of the roof, followed by a blast of wind and snow.

Van Helsing holsters his gun and rums to go, he winces in
pain. Carl sees this and reaches for Van Helsing's cloak.

CARL
Are you hurt?

Van Helsing shoves his hand away. Frankenstein's eyes narrow
suspiciously, then he lunges forward and rips Van Helsing's
cloak open, revealing the puncture wounds in his shirt.

FRANKENSTEIN
He has been bitten! Bitten by a
werewolf.

Van Helsing pulls his cloak tight. Frankenstein's face forms
a twisted smile.

FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
Now you will become that which you
have hunted so passionately.
Helsing pulls out the BLOWGUN and looks at Frankenstein.

VAN HELSING
I'm sorry.

And he means it. Frankenstein just glares.
76.

FRANKENSTEIN
May others be as passionate in
their hunting of you.

Van Helsing FIRES THE DARTS.
EXT. VILKOVA PALACE GRAVEYARD - DUSK

The last shadows of the day stretch like creepy fingers
across an ancient ROYAL GRAVEYARD. Wearing costumes and
masks, Van Helsing and Carl step out of an old MAUSOLEUM.
They shove the huge stone door shut and bar it tight.

CARL
According to the books, you wont
turn into a werewolf until the
rising of your first full moon, two
nights from now, and then you'll
still be able to fight Dracula's
hold over you until the final
stroke of midnight.

The two men make their way through the tombstones, heading
for a huge, ornate PALACE next door.

VAN HELSING
(sarcastic)
Sounds like I have nothing to worry
about.

CARL
Oh my God, you should be terrified.

Van Helsing gives him a look. Then Carl gets It.

CARL (CONT'D)

Oh ... well, urn, that still gives
us forty-eight hours to find a
solution.

Carl looks back at the mausoleum.

CARL (CONT'D)
Are you sure he can't get out of
there?

VAN HELSING
Not without some help from the
dead.

TIGHT on a COFFIN, lying in the frozen ground, waiting to be
buried. The lid cracks open, gnarled fingers pry their way
out.
77.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

The grand ballroom is packed with dancing couples and alive
with JUGGLERS, FIRE BLOWERS, TIGHT ROPE WALKERS, and HIGH
WIRE ACROBATS, a veritable Cirque du Solei!' Van Helsing and
Carl make their way through all the weirdness.

CARL
Well, this is different.

VAN HELSING
Dracula must have something up his
sleeve.

CARL
So in situations like this, do we
have a solid plan? Or do we just
improvise?

VAN HELSING
A bit of both actually.

They step up to the ornate banquet tables. Van Helsing
inhales deeply. Carl does likewise.

CARL
Smells wonderful, doesn't it?

VAN HELSING
Not everything.

CARL
What do you smell?

VAN HELSING
Everything.

Van Helsing looks around, suddenly very SUSPICIOUS.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Warm pretzels, juniper bushes,
ladies perfume, and rotted human
flesh.

Carl gives him a look.
CARL

You sure do know how to put a
damper on the evening.
78.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Dracula dances with Anna, both
wearing masks. He dips her and removes her mask. She is ina
trance. Eyes open, unblinking. Dracula throws away his mask
and kisses her. Anna snaps out of it. Dracula spins her
around.

DRACULA
How does it feel to be a puppet on
my string?

Anna suddenly looks around, realizing she's dancing with
Dracula. She struggles, but is completely within his power.

ANNA
I wont let you trade me, Count.

DRACULA
I have no intention of trading you.
And if I know Van Helsing, which I
do, he isn't planning on making a
trade either.

He dips her and leans in close, their lips almost touching.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Neither of us has ever settled for
half.

ANNA
You make my skin craw!

DRACULA
That's not all I could do with your
skin.

Dracula gently caresses her neck. Aleera cuts in and grabs
Anna away from Dracula.

ALEERA
My rum.

Aleera dances away with Anna. Dracula smiles, then randomly
grabs a passing woman, yanks her close and bites into her
neck. The ballroom is in such high swing no one notices.
INT. BALLROOM - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Van Helsing and Carl look down on the
ballroom. Carl spots Aleera dancing with Anna.
79.

CARL
There they are.

VAN HELSING
Something's not right.

CARL
Yes, they're both trying to lead.

VAN HELSING
Not that.

And then Van Helsing spots something, his eyes light up.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Carl?

CARL
Yes?

VAN HELSING
I have a plan. I need you to do
something.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
BACK ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Aleera dances Anna across the floor.

ALEERA
It's the little things in life that
I love. Like that last look in my
victim's eyes just before they die.

We see in Anna's eyes how hard she's struggling to break
free. Aleera licks Anna's cheek.

ALEERA (CONT'D)
I won't let the Master take you,
Anna.

Aleera’s canines distend into horrible fangs, draining from
her beautiful face.

ALEERA (CONT'D)
I want him all to myself.

Anna's eyes widen, helpless in Aleera's grasp. And that's
when Dracula cuts in, he giver Aleera a smile.

DRACULA
You look famished, my dear, go get
yourself a bite.
80.

Aleera scowls as Dracula spins Anna over to a MIRROR WALL.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Don't we make a beautiful couple?

Anna looks at the mirror. Dracula is not in the reflection.
He starts to dance with her in front of the mirror.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
I'm looking for a new bride, Anna,
someone strong and beautiful.

In the mirror it looks like Anna is dancing alone, seemingly
being dipped and spun and twirled by an invisible force.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
All it takes is one bite from me.

He hugs her tighter. Anna looks from his face to his chest,
crushed tightly against her breasts, her eyes widen.

ANNA

You have no heartbeat.
DRACULA

Perhaps it just needs to be

rekindled.

Dracula leans in for a kiss. Anna angrily turns her head
away, so she doesn't see all the blood drain from Dracula’s
face and his canines distend into fangs, about to bite into
her neck.

A Fire Breather tilts his head safely up and away from the
crowd, lifts a torch to his mouth and starts to BLOW Carl
quickly sidles up and shoves him hard. The Fire Breather
BLOWS FLAMES across the back of Dracula's cape.

INT. BALLROOM - SECOND FLOOR -NIGHT

UP ON THE BALCONY: Van Helsing dashes down the HIGH WIRE. The
TIGHT ROPE WALKERS start to lose their balance.

INT. BALLROOM - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

DOWN ON THE DANCE FLOOR: Dracula whirls around, ON FIRE,
shocked and angry.
81.

INT. BALLROOM - ABOVE DANCE FWOR-NIGHT

HIGH ABOVE THE DANCE FLOOR: Van Helsing curs a stay-wire,
grabs on and SWINGS DOWN into the crowd. The Tight Rope
Walkers ALL FALL.

INT. BALLROOM - DANCE FLOOR- NIGHT DOWN ON THE DANCE FLOOR:

Dracula grabs the Fire Breather and tosses him dear across
the ballroom. Van Helsing swoops in, grabs Anna by her waist
and swings her up into the air.

INT. BALLROOM - BALCONY - NIGHT

UP ON THE BALCONY: Van Helsing and Anna land, skid to a stop
and look down.

The entire crowd looks up at our heroes. And then, in unison,
they all remove their masks. Their eyes go yellow, their skin
goes white, fangs glide out, they HISS angrily. They are all
VAMPIRES. Dracula smiles up at Van Helsing.

DRACULA
Welcome to my summer palace.

A side door bursts open and a batch of vampires charge in
carrying Frankenstein over their heads, he's chained tight
and bellowing furiously. Igor stands on his chest.

IGOR
We have him, Master! We have him!

Dracula gives an evil LAUGH, then looks at his followers and
gestures to Van Helsing and Anna.

DRACULA
Enjoy yourselves!

The entire vampire crowd rushes forward, SHRIEKING like wild
Banshees.

Anna's response is to rip the arm off a SUIT OF ARMOR, stick
her hand down the sleeve and into its metal glove, attached
to the glove is an IRON MACE covered in spikes. Van Helsing's
response is to give her an incredulous look, then grab her
and yank her out of FRAME.

INT. BALLROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna race down a hallway.
82.

ANNA
Where are we going!?

Van Helsing points to a huge STAINED GLASS WINDOW of angels,
cherubs, and saints.

VAN HELSING
Through that window!

ANNA
Are you out of your mind?! We'll be
cut to ribbons!

VAN HELSING
Not if you relax when you're going
through it.

At the last second Van Helsing notices one of the SAINTS has
his hand out, as if to say "STOP." Van Helsing grabs Anna and
skids to a stop.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
My mistake, wrong window.

ANNA
How do you know?

VAN HELSING
Just a hunch.

He yanks her out of FRAME. Vampires bound past, chasing after
them. Dracula's LAUGH echoes throughout the palace.

INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

Van Helsing and Anna race up some stairs and through a set of
double doors, vampires hot on their tail. They each grab a
door, slam it shut and bolt it tight. The vampires furiously
smash away from the other side. Van Helsing and Anna high-
tail it down the hall.

Carl comes scurrying around a corner at the far end of the
hallway. He sees Van Helsing and Anna running towards him and
holds up his LAVA CONTRAPTION.

CARL
Now I know what it's for.

Carl is standing in front of another huge window.

CARL (CONT'D)
Where are we going?
83.

VAN HELSING/ANNA
Through that window!

Carl turns around to see the window they're talking about, he
pulls the pin on his contraption. Van Helsing and Anna each
grab one of Carl's arms, on the run, and yank him out through
the great glass window.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl crash through the shower of glass
and drop rwo stories down into a watery CATACOMB.

INT. STAIRCASE/HALLWAY - NIGHT

The huge door disintegrates as the vampires crash through it.
They bound down the hallway. The contraption is sitting on
the floor, it pops open, rays of ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT stream
out. The vampires all melt screaming.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl burst to the surface inside a
large moldy catacomb filled with skulls and skeletons, the
huge EXPLOSION OF LIGHT finishing above them as pieces of
melted vampire splash down around them.

VAN HELSING
Carl, you're a genius.

CARL
(a bit freaked out)
A genius with access to unstable
chemicals.

Behind them, Igor YELLS commands in Hungarian as he and a
dozen of the porcine Dwergi ride a LONGBOAT down a ramp,
Frankenstein chained to the mast. Van Helsing immediately
heads for the longboat.

Igor and the Dwergi drop their oars into the water and start
to row. Van Helsing runs faster. Igor and the Dwergi paddle

out of a tunnel and into the river. A huge grated GATE starts
to drop down behind them. Igor pats Frankenstein on the head.

IGOR
Say goodbye to your friends.

Frankenstein BELLOWS angrily. Igor cackles.
84.

IGOR (CONT'D)
Because where we are taking you,
only God and the devil know.

The metal gate SLAMS SHUT right in front of Van Helsing,
cutting him off from the river, he splashes up to it and
stares out through the grates. Frankenstein looks back at Van
Helsing. Frankenstein's hag-gard face a mask of helplessness
and hopelessness, looking forlorn and abandoned. Van Helsing
stares at him and grits his teeth in determination.

VAN HELSING
I'll find you!... I'll get you back
and set you free. I swear to god.

A huge DARK SHADOW swoops past, its talons scrape across the
metal grating, SPARKS FLY.

DRACULA (0.S.)
God hasn't helped you in years, Van
Helsing, why should he start now!?

We hear Aleera LAUGH as the two dark shadows flyaway. Anna
and Carl run up beside Van Helsing. Anna grabs him.

ANNA

Come on, we've got to beat them
back to Castle Frankenstein.

Van Helsing whirls around and starts to go.
VAN HELSING
Yes, I've got to save that

creature.

CARL (0.S.)
Van Helsing!

Van Helsing turns back to Carl, who is till staring out
through the grate.

CARL (CONT'D)
I cabled Rome earlier, to apprise
them of our situation.
Van Helsing gives Carl a suspicious look.

VAN HELSING
And what did they say?

Carl turns to face him.
85.

CARL
Even if you do somehow kill
Dracula... Rome orders you to

destroy Frankenstein as well.
Van Helsing's eyes darken, he starts to rev up.

VAN HELSING
He isn't evil.

CARL
Yes, but they said he isn't human
either.

Van Helsing furiously closes in on Carl.

VAN HELSING
Do they know him? Have they talked
with him? Who are they to judge!?

CARL
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

Van Helsing angrily grabs Carl by the throat and lifts him up
off his feet.

VAN HELSING
And what of me? Did you tell them
what I am to become? Did they tell
you how to kill me? The correct
angle of the stake as it enters my
heart?! The exact measure of silver
in each bullet!!

Van Helsing's voice has gotten incredibly deeper during this
speech, his eyes have gone dark red and he's strangling Carl.
Anna is already trying to rip the two men apart, but Van
Helsing's strength is too much for her. Carl gasps:

CARL
No .... I... I left you out.

Van Helsing snaps out of it and lets him go. Carl drops to
the ground, sucking air. Van Helsing stares down at him,
feeling terribly, then he looks at his shaking hands, a
whirlwind of emotions passing over his face, he clenches his
hands into fists, then exhales deeply and looks at Anna.

VAN HELSING
It's starting.
86.

INT. CASTLE FRANKENSTEIN LABORATORY - DAY

Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl run into the laboratory. It's
empty, all of the lab equipment has been hurriedly removed.

VAN HELSING
They must have taken all the
equipment to Dracula's lair.

ANNA
Then we've lost.

CARL
Dracula cannot bring his children
to life until the sun sets. We
still have time.

ANNA
(incredulous)
"Time?" The sun sets in two hours,
and we've been searching for him
for more than four hundred years.

CARL
I wasn't around for those four
hundred years, now was I?
EXT. MANOR VALERIOUS - DAY
The rays of the mid-day sun are trying to pry their way
through the cloud-streaked sky over Manor Valerious. We can
hear Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl pounding up a staIrcase.

VAN HELSING (0.S.)
So what did you learn?

INT. TOWER BEDROOM - DAY

Our heroes enter the tower bedroom where they come upon the
mass of relics, artifacts, and texts.

CARL
That Count Dracula was actually the
son of Valerio us the Elder.
Carl looks at Anna.

CARL (CONT'D)
The son of you're ancestor.

Anna just shrugs, no big deal.
ANNA
Everybody knows that, what else?

CARL
Oh, uh, right. Well, it all started
in 1462, when Dracula was murdered.

VAN HELSING
Does it say who murdered him?

CARL
No, just some vague reference to
the Left Hand of God.

Van Helsing looks intrigued. Carl opens the elaborately

inscribed SACRED LATIN TEXT.

CARL (CONT'D)
Anyway, according to this when
Dracula died he made a covenant
with the devil.

Van Helsing and Anna jump in, guessing.

VAN HELSING
And was given a new life.

ANNA
But the only way to sustain that
life was by drinking the blood of
others.

CARL
(annoyed)
Are you two going to let me tell
the story?

VAN HELSING/ANNA
Sorry. Sorry.

CARL
Your ancestor, having sired this
evil creature, went to Rome to seek
forgiveness from God, that's when
the bargain was made, Valerious the
Elder was to kill Dracula in return
for the eternal salvation of his
entire family, right down the line
all the way to you.

He points to Anna. Anna nods in understanding.
88.

ANNA
But he couldn't do it. As evil as
Dracula was, my ancestor could not
kill his own son.

Carl points at some of the fantastical engravings on the
relics and artifacts, helping tell the story:

CARL
So he banished Dracula to an icy
fortress, sending him through a
door from which there was no
return.

ANNA
And then the devil gave him wings.

CARL
Yes.

VAN HELSING
All right, so where is this door?

CARL
I don't know, but when the old
knight couldn't kill his son, he
left clues, so that future
generations might do it for him.

ANNA
That must be what my father was
looking for in here, clues to the
door's location.

An idea suddenly springs into Van Helsing's head.

VAN HELSING
The door... The door... of course!

He turns and races out of the room. Anna and Carl exchange a
look, then haul-ass after Van Helsing.

INT. ARMORY - DAY

Van Helsing runs up to the massive floor-to-ceiling OIL
PAINTING of Transylvania. Anna and Carl right behind him.

VAN HELSING
You said your father spent hours
staring at this painting, trying to
find Dracula's lair, I think you
were right, quite literally.
89.

Van Helsing checks where the frame meets the wall, but the
frame is actually molded into the wall.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
I think this is the door. He just
didn't know how to open it.

Carl points to a LATIN INSCRIPTION on the painting.

CARL
Look! A Latin inscription. Maybe it
works like that painting in the
tower.

Carl starts mumbling the inscription in Latin. Anna steps up
to Van Helsing

ANNA
If this was a door, my father would
have opened it long ago.

Carl shoves a chair aside, revealing a missing piece of the
painting.
CARL
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

VAN HELSING
Your father didn't have this.

Van Helsing pulls out the torn piece of painted cloth.

ANNA
Where did you get that?

Van Helsing hands the painted piece of cloth to Carl.

VAN HELSING
Finish it.
Carl places it inside the missing piece of the map. The torn
piece is a perfect match. Carl finishes the inscription.

CARL
Deum lacessat ac ianuam imbeat
apenn.

VAN HELSING
In the name of God, open this door.
90.

And that's when the painting begins to change, starting at
the frame line and spreading inward, a THICK CRYSTAL FROST
washes over the painting, eating it up until the painting has
completely dissolved, leaving an ANCIENT MIRROR in its place.

CARL
A mirror?

Anna stares at it, thinking hard.

ANNA
Dracula has no reflection in a
mirror.
VAN HELSING
Why?
CARL
Maybe ... maybe to Dracula, it's

not a mirror at all.

Van Helsing reaches out to touch the mirror, his hand goes
straight through it, vanishing inside it, he inhales sharply.
Carl Jumps.

CARL/ANNA
What? What?!

VAN HELSING
It's cold.

He pulls his hand out to reveal SNOWFLAKES in his palm.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
And it's snowing.

Van Helsing grabs a TORCH out of a sconce on the wall, and
prepares to step through.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
See you on the other side.

CARL
Don't worry, we're behind you ...
not right behind you, but behind
you.

Anna grabs his arm.

ANNA
Be careful.
91.

Van Helsing gives her a nod, then steps straight through the
mirror, vanishing inside it.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - DUSK

Van Helsing steps out of another ancient mirror, encased in a
huge black OBELISK. It's snowing. A beat later, Anna steps
through. They both look up. Chiselled out of a massive rock
mountain is an enormous cathedral-like fortress; spires,
turrets, gargoyles, the works. Covered in permafrost. Icicles
everywhere. Carelessly flung hither and yon are human
skeletons. Something very evil lives here. THUNDER RUMBLES.

ANNA
Castle Dracula.

They look back at the mirror. Carl is nowhere in sight. They
head for the castle. Behind them, Carl slowly seeps out of
the mirror, eyes closed, he opens them to see the forbidding
fortress. The sheer enormity of it terrifies him. He spins
around and runs back into the mirror-wham! Face first,
bounces off and lands on his ass. The mirror is a one-way
ticket. Carl leaps up and scurries after them.

CARL
Wait up!

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - NIGHT

They arrive at a massive door at the front of the ancient
fortress, made of iron, rusted shut, covered in slippery ice.
There's a TRANSOM at the top of it, but it's thirty feet up.

CARL
Do we have a plan? It doesn't have
to be Wellington's at Waterloo, but
some sort of plan would be nice.

VAN HELSING
We're going to go in there and stop

Dracula.

ANNA
And kill anything that gets in our
way.

Carl starts to back away.

CARL
Let me know how that goes.

Van Helsing grabs Carl and Anna by their collars and runs
straight up, thirty feet, they go right through the transom.
92.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

The three of them land softly on the floor on the other side.
Anna and Carl are shocked, they turn and look at Van Helsing.

CARL
Well, as grateful as I am to be out
of the cold, that doesn't seem like
a good thing.

Anna looks at Van Helsing, bent over in pain, his face and
eyes ate distorted into a vague resemblance of a wolf, and
then it passes. They share a look.

Then he moves forward, a man on a mission. The whole place is
a massive frozen foyer, and all of the incredibly high walls,
pillars, and ceilings are covered in gooey COCOONS. Thousands
of them. With electric wires sticking out of all of them.

ANNA
Oh my god, if he brings all of
these to life ...

CARL
-.. the world would be a
smorgasbord.

And that's when Igor comes scurrying around a comer, a bundle
of wires and electrodes in his hands, he skids to a stop,
looking stunned as he sees Van Helsing.

IGOR
How? How did you? ... It's
impossible.

He quickly recovers his senses, drops everything and runs
like hell. Van Helsing pumps one of the saw blades into his
palm and throws it, it whistles through the air, catches Igor
by his sleeve, and pins him to a rock wall.

IGOR (CONT'D)
Please! Please don't kill me!

Van Helsing strides forward.

VAN HELSING
Why?

IGOR
Well, urn, I...

He can't think of a good reason. Van Helsing rips the blade
out of the wall, about to kill him.
93.

And then they hear Frankenstein BELLOW Somewhere nearby. They
look around. Right next to Igor is a window with metal bars.
Van Helsing sees something moving inside it. It's a PULLEY
with chains. He sticks his torch through the bars and looks
down a SHAFT.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - DUNGEON -NIGHT

Frankenstein is in a DUNGEON CELL encased in a huge BLOCK OF
ICE, only his head and neck stick out, chains run through the
block and attach up to the pulley. The shaft rises another
thirty floors. From the top of the shaft a VOICE rings out:

DRACULA (0.S.)
Bring me the monster...!!

Dracula's voice ECHOES through the immense fortress as Igor
snickers evilly.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ENTRANCE HALLWAY - DUSK

IGOR
My Master has awakened.

The pulley starts to rise. The chains snap taut. Frankenstein
and the block of ice quickly lift up off the cell floor.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ENTRANCE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Van Helsing drops the torch and goes nuts, furiously yanking
and pulling on the thick bars with incredible strength, they
actually start to twist, but they're never going to give,
even with the semi-insane look which has crept into his eyes.
Anna tries to help, to no avail.

The block of ice continues its rise. Van Helsing collapses
against the bars, the insane look seeps away, he's back to
himself once again. Frankenstein comes eye-to-eye with him.
The two beings look at each other, a real connection between
the two of them. The look on Frankenstein's face softens.

FRANKENSTEIN
There is a cure.

Van Helsing is shocked.

VAN HELSING
What?

FRANKENSTEIN
Dracula, he has the cure, to remove
the curse of the Werewolf.
94,

Frankenstein continues up the shaft. Van Helsing desperately
tries to stick his head through the bars, gaining one last
look up at Frankenstein as he's hauled up.

FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
Go! Find the cure! Save yourself!

Anna grabs Van Helsing and pulls him back.
ANNA
Come on! You heard him! Let's find
it.
Van Helsing looks at her, thinking hard.

VAN HELSING
Why does Dracula have a cure?

ANNA
I don't care.

VAN HELSING
I do. Why would he need one?

Van Helsing looks at Igor. Igor clamps his mouth shut. The
CAMERA does a dramatic PUSH IN on Carl as his face fills with
a dawning realization:

CARL
Because the only thing that can
kill him ... is a werewolf.

Van Helsing and Anna look at Carl. Carl smiles.

CARL (CONT'D)
The painting. That's what it meant.

ANNA
But Dracula has used werewolves to
do his biding for centuries.

CARL
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure to
remove the curse and make it human
before it bit him.

The realization of this crashes down on them. Van Helsing
turns to Igor and gestures to Anna and Carl.

VAN HELSING
You're going to take these two and
lead them to it.
95.

IGOR
No I'm not.

Van Helsing sticks the blade under Igor's chin. Igor smiles.

IGOR (CONT'D)
Yes I am.

Carl steps up.

CARL
When the bell begins to roll
midnight, you'll be able to kill
Dracula, we just have to find the
cure and get it into you before the
final stroke.

Van Helsing pulls a small but extremely nasty-looking WEAPON
out of his cloak. It looks like nail clippers designed by the
Spanish Inquisition. He holds it up in front of Igor's face.

VAN HELSING
If they even suspect you're
misleading them ...

He hands the weapon to Anna.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
--. Clip off one of his fingers.

ANNA
My pleasure.

Igor looks terrified, he gestures to the set of staircases.

IGOR
The stairs on the right, they lead
to the black tower, that's where it
is.

VAN HELSING
And the stairs on the left?

Igor hesitates. Van Helsing reaches for the "clippers. "

IGOR
The Devil's tower! Devil's tower!
That's where we reassembled the
laboratory. Would I lie to you?

VAN HELSING
Not if you wanted to live.
96.

Van Helsing turns to Carl.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
If I'm not "cured" by the twelfth
stroke of midnight ...

He pulls a metal tube out of his cloak, naps out into a
SILVER STAKE, and hands it to Carl. Carl's eyes widen.

CARL
I don't think I could.

VAN HELSING
You must.

Carl nods, takes the stake, shares a look with Van Helsing,
and then grabs Igor by the scruff of his neck and pulls him
off towards the staircases.

CARL
Come on.

Van Helsing and Anna look into each other's eyes, both of
them scared, both of them gearing up. Van Helsing has never
been so concerned for another human being in his life.

VAN HELSING
Don't get killed.

Anna has never been so filled with conviction in her life.

ANNA
You still don't understand. It
doesn't matter what happens to me.
We must save my family.

She starts to go. Van Helsing pulls her back.

VAN HELSING
If you're late ... run like hell.

She nods and starts to go. Van Helsing Pulls her back again.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
Don't be late.

She smiles and starts to go. Van Helsing pulls her back
again, and then kisses her hard. She gives it right back to
him, a real bodice ripper, she pulls herself away, stares
deep into his smoldering eyes, then runs off after Carl.
97.

INT. LABORATORY TOWER - NIGHT

The Dwergi are putting the final touches em the reassembly of
Victor Frankenstein's equipment. Frankenstein himself is now
welded into the iron pod, bellowing angrily. Dracula strides
past, slamming all of the huge electrical switches on.

DRACULA
What ate you complaining about?

The entire laboratory sparks to life. Spectacular arcs of
electricity shoot up and down the walls between the dynamos.
The gears kick in. The fan belts snap taut and start to spin.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
This is why you were made, to prove
that god is not the only one who
can create life!

Dracula turns the flywheel. Frankenstein begins to rise.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
And now you will give that life to
my young.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - RIGHT TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT

Van Helsing comes up the spiraling stone staircase and sees a
large gash in the rock wall.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - SHAFT -NIGHT

Van Helsing steps inside and sees CHAINS jangling in the
middle of the dark shaft, he looks down at the fifteen-story
drop. And then he jumps. He grabs the chains, swings wildly,
dangling precariously, some of his weapons drop out of his
cloak and fall. And then, with superhuman strength, agility
and speed, Van Helsing starts to climb the chains.

INT. CASTLE DRACULA - ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Igor leads Anna and Carl up the stairs to a landing with an
arched doorway, the entrance to the Antidote Tower.

IGOR
There it is.

Inside the large room is a pedestal. On the pedestal is a
GLASS JAR filled with a clear jelly-like goo, suspended in
the goo is a SYRINGE. Igor starts to enter. Anna grabs him
and holds him back.
98.

ANNA
I'll go first.

Igor gives her a nasty look. Anna gives it back to him, then
enters the tower, eyes on the alert, heading for the syringe.
All the windows are barred shut. There is no other entrance.

Carl watches her, his eyes momentarily off Igor. Igor uses
the moment, takes a quick step back, and with the heel of his
boot, kicks Carl in the ass. Anna spins around in time to see
Carl sprawl into the room. Igor cackles gleefully.

IGOR
Stay as long as you like.

He pulls a lever on the wall, a grated metal gate crashes
down, locking Anna and Carl inside the tower. Igor scurries
away laughing.

IGOR (CONT'D)
Bye-bye!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
All of the equipment is accelerating wildly.

The Dwergi are desperately trying to keep everything from
spinning out of control. Dracula is in rapture as sparks rain
down upon him.

Van Helsing climbs up out of the shaft and hides behind the
shattered block of ice, which is being pelted and melted by
raining sparks. Dynamos crackle. Pulleys whirl. Electrical
arcs flash. Van Helsing looks up. Sixty feet above him is an
OPEN SKYLIGHT, twenty feet above that is the POD apparatus.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - SKYLIGHT -NIGHT

Frankenstein struggles in the pod as LIGHTNING FLASHES across
the sky above him.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna and Carl are staring at the syringe inside the jar of
vile goo.

ANNA
Go ahead, grab it.
99,

CARL
You go ahead and grab it. If
there's one thing I've learned,
it's never be the first one to
stick your hand into a viscous
material.

A hideous FACE lowers down right behind them. It's Aleera.

ALEERA
Smart boy.

Carl practically jumps out of his skin. Anna grabs Carl and
jerks him back behind the huge jar. Aleera drops down with a
smile.

ALEERA (CONT'D)
Did I scare you?

CARL
(terrified)
No.

ALEERA
Then maybe I need to try a little
harder.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Van Helsing starts to climb STRAIGHT UP THE SHEER WALL.
Grasping for purchase in the grouting. Only someone with
superhuman strength in their fingertips could do this.

A Dwerger on scaffolding turns around and comes face-to-face
with Van Helsing, clinging to the wall like a fly. The
Dwerger's goggles are up and we get our first glimpse of the
hideous Dwergi eyes. Before the Dwerger can even scream, Van
Helsing grabs him with one hand, slams him off the rock wall,
then chucks him into the dark recesses of the laboratory.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna suddenly lashes out with her sword and knocks over the
jar. It crashes to the floor, splattering some goo on Aleera.
The vile goo burns like acid into her and right through the
stone floor. Aleera HOWLS in pain and rage. Carl freaks.

CARL
See! What did I tell you!?

Anna gestures to the syringe rolling across the floor.
100.

ANNA
Grab it! Grab it! Grab it!

Using the hem of his frock, Carl scoops up the syringe, it
burns and smokes and he jumps and yelps, but he still manages
to hold onto it. In the meantime, Anna has grabbed a piece of
the glass and scooped up some of the goo. She runs and flings
it at the bars of the gate. A hole melts through the bars.

ANNA (CONT'D)
C'mon!

Carl races to the hole, the syringe smoking-up his frock.
Anna shoves Carl out first.

ANNA (CONT'D)
Go! Go! Go!

Carl races off down the hall. Before Anna can get out, a hand
grabs her and spins her around. It's Aleera. The burns on her
face HEAL.

ALEERA
You can't go until I say you can
go.
ANNA
KEEP RUNNING CARL!
ALEERA
And I'll say you can go when you're

dead.

Aleera grabs Anna and throws her across the floor. Anna skids
across the room, her sabre goes flying.

EXT. CASTLE DRACULA - SKYLIGHT -NIGHT

Up on the pod Van Helsing comes eye-to-eye with Frankenstein.
The WIND whips at them. LIGHTNING FLASHES. THUNDER ROARS. Van
Helsing grabs one of the three metal straps welded onto the
bolts riveted down Frankenstein's chest.

VAN HELSING
This is going to hurt.

FRANKENSTEIN
(grits his teeth)
I am accustomed to pain.

Van Helsing nods, bad-to-the-bone.
101.

VAN HELSING
Lets you know you're alive.

With his new strength, Van Helsing rips the first metal strap
off. Frankenstein grimaces in pain. And that's when a BOLT OF
LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod. Van Helsing is
catapulted into the air. Frankenstein roars in pain.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula looks up as a BLAST OF ENERGY emanates from the pod
down into the room and through the equipment, which instantly
OVERLOADS, spitting FLAMES and SPARKS. One of the Dwergi is
blown across the room, ON FIRE. Dracula smiles maniacally.

DRACULA
Give me LIFE!!!

The blast of energy surges out through every door, crack, and
pore of the room.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

The energy blast envelops the entrance hall washing over all
the cocoons, which begin to UNDULATE with life.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing dangles from the edge of the tower, it's a sixty
floor drop to an icy canyon below, electrical wires crackle
and spit all around him. He starts to claw his way back up.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna staggers to her feet as Aleera strides towards her. Anna
grabs a torch off the wall and lunges at Aleera's face.
Aleera just blows it out. Anna quickly backs away. Aleera
smiles, then one by one she blows out all of the torches in
the room until the place goes PITCH BLACK.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The weather has gone insane. Thunder, lightning, rain and
wind whip down around Cart as he runs out, onto an enormous
ancient STONE BRIDGE that connects the two towers. It's
covered in huge potholes and barbed rubble. A LIGHTNING
STRIKE hits one of the stone pilasters on the bridge. It's
going to be a very difficult six hundred yard dash.

And that's when Igor runs out with his cattle prod. Carl jags
out of the way as the prod slams into the railing right next
to him, just missing him, spitting sparks.
102.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing rips the second metal strap off of Frankenstein.
Frankenstein grimaces in pain, then he sees something coming.

FRANKENSTEIN
Look out!

Van Helsing throws himself to the floor of the apparatus as
once again LIGHTNING STRIKES the conductor above the pod.
Frankenstein roars in pain.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Another energy blast surges through the room. Dracula lifts
his arms and eyes to the sky in triumph.

DRACULA
One more bolt and my young shall
live!

And then he sees Van Helsing high above him. Dracula scowls
and TRANSFORMS into a HIDEOUS WINGED BEAST FROM HELL.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Pitch black. And then a lightning strike illuminates Anna,
groping her way around the room, WE RACK FOCUS to see Aleera
hanging upside down from the ceiling twenty feet behind her.

WE PUSH IN ON Aleera's gleaming face. And then go to her POV:
Aleera can see perfectly in the dark. She watches as Anna
gropes her way across the dark wall, heading for the gate.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

SPARKS explode off the tip of the cattle prod as it slams
into a pilaster right next to Carl's head. Carl takes off
running across the ancient bridge towards the distant tower.
Igor chases after him with the sparking prod.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Van Helsing rips the last metal strap off of Frankenstein.
And that's when the hideous Winged Dracula Beast swoops up
and rips into Van Helsing, throwing him back. Van Helsing
bounces off the apparatus and drops-

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

-sixty feet down through the room, crashing through the
equipment on his way. SPARKS FLY. FLAMES BLOW Dwergi run.
103.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Frankenstein stands up, dazed, about to step out of the pod.
Another BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the conductor. It lights
Frankenstein up like a Christmas tree and catapults him
through the air. An energy blast surges down into the lab.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

And washes over the cocoons. The cocoons begin to EXPLODE.
Hundreds and hundreds of the hideous pygmy bats burst out and
swarm around the great hall.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna makes it to the gate. Lightning flashes, revealing
Aleera standing on the other side of it, she punches Anna
across the room. Anna slams into a wall and drops like a sack
of potatoes, out cold.

EXT. SKYLIGHT - NIGHT

Frankenstein clings to the edge of the tower, struggling to
hold on as electrical wires spark and spit all around him. He
loses his grip and starts to drop. It's sixty stories down.
He manages to grab a wire, which snaps loose and swings him
down and across the castle, his legs kicking wildly.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl runs like mad, weaving and bobbing as Igor tries to nail
him with the cattle prod. Carl suddenly sees Frankenstein
swinging on a wire, coming right at him. Carl dives to the
ground as the wire whips over his head. The wire catches Igor
across the chest and launches him out over the railing. The
wire then catches on a pilaster whipping Frankenstein into
the bridge. Igor drops past him, screaming in terror on his
long journey down to the icy valley below.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna groggily rolls over on the floor. Aleera steps up over
her, then grabs her and lifts her up while TRANSFORMING into
a huge winged bat.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Battered and bloody, Van Helsing staggers through the burning
equipment, looking delirious.
104.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl looks over the railing. Sees Frankenstein hanging by the
wire, dangling sixty stories up, losing his grip, sliding
down the last five feet of the wire, now four feet, now three
feet, two feet, one. He looks up at Carl.

FRANKENSTEIN
Help ... me.

Carl is emotionally torn.

CARL
You're supposed to die.

Frankenstein grimaces, desperately clinging to life.

FRANKENSTEIN
I want to live.

Carl makes his decision.
CARL
All right! All right! Hold on! Hold
on!
Carl sticks the syringe between his teeth, grabs the
connector wire and pulls with all his might.

INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Anna can barely move, choking from the incredible grip Aleera
has on her throat. Aleera's hideous face smiles.

ALEERA
Be happy in the knowledge that I
shall weep over your dead body.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Carl gives one last tug. The wire breaks loose from the
pilaster. Frankenstein swings away from the bridge and arcs
up towards a barred window on the side of the Antidote Tower.
INT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT

Aleera's fangs distend, she leans into bite Anna's neck. And

that's when Frankenstein crashes through the barred window
and slams into them. Anna is knocked free.
105.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The huge Winged Beast strides through the flames, then
TRANSFORMS back into Dracula, a smile on his lips.

DRACULA
You're too late, my friend! My
live!

Van Helsing backs away, really mess

VAN HELSING
Then the only way to kill them...

He looks out through a window at the CLOCK TOWER.

VAN HELSING (CONT'D)
++. is to kill you.

A look of pure confidence fills Dracula's face.

DRACULA
That is correct.

A deranged look fills Van Helsing's face.
VAN HELSING
So be it.
EXT. ANTIDOTE TOWER - NIGHT
Anna looks back into the tower. Aleera lunges at her, but
Frankenstein grabs her. Anna starts to head back to help

Frankenstein.

FRANKENSTEIN
No! Go help Van Helsing.

Frankenstein throws Aleera across the room, then looks at
Anna.

FRANKENSTEIN (CONT'D)
Now!

Anna looks him in the eyes.

ANNA
Thank you.

Frankenstein nods and turns back to Aleera, who flies across
the room and tackles him. Anna scrambles back out the window.
106.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

A bolt of lightning suddenly rips a huge GAPING HOLE out of
the bridge near Carl, blocking him from continuing forward.
It's a twenty-foot leap or a sixty-story drop. He looks back
and sees Anna crawling out of the smashed window.

CARL
Anna! I need some help!

Anna clings to the wind-whipped wall, trying not to get blown
into the precipice.

ANNA
Now is not a good time, Carl!!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
As Dracula moves in on Van Helsing,

Van Helsing looks out a window to the CLOCK-TOWER. The BIG
HAND slams forward. It is now exactly one minute to midnight.
The clock CHIMES. Van Helsing's whole body suddenly
CONVULSES. Insanity pours into his eyes. Dracula looks
perplexed. Van Helsing GROANS:

VAN HELSING
One.

Van Helsing TRANSFORMS into the biggest, sexiest, most bad-
assed Werewolf ever. Dracula looks stunned.

DRACULA
No .... This ... this is not right
(furious)

This can not be!
EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT
Carl looks from the clock tower to Anna.

CARL
Hurry!

Anna leaps out and grabs the same electrical wire that
Frankenstein used. The wire HISSES and SPARKS as Anna is
swung down across the castle. The CLOCK CHIMES.

ANNA
Two!
107.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Dracula cautiously backs off as the huge Werewolf collects
itself and moves towards him. For the first time in his long
life, Dracula actually looks nervous, he plays for time.

DRACULA
You and I are part of the same
grand game, Gabriel. But we need
not find ourselves on opposite
sides of the board.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Carl steps up to the edge of the bridge,
he's going to throw Anna the syringe.

CARL
Three!

Anna switches wires in mid-air as she rockets across the
castle. Carl aims and throws the syringe. Anna grabs it! Then
arcs up towards the Laboratory Tower.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The Werewolf LUNGES at Dracula. Dracula whirls around,
becoming the Winged Beast, he flies up the wall, heading for
the open skylight. The Werewolf bounds after him, ripping its
way straight up the sheer rock, it leaps out and grabs the
Winged Beast. Both creatures crash down into the equipment.

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES as Anna arcs up towards the Laboratory
Tower. And that's when Aleera swoops down and cuts the wire.
Anna is thrown off. She crashes onto a ledge of the tower.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
Dracula leaps up first and backs away.

DRACULA
You're being used Gabriel. As was
I. But I escaped, and so can you!

The Werewolf springs at Dracula. Dracula becomes the Winged
Beast and desperately uses his four razor sharp appendages to
claw at the Werewolf. The Werewolf howls in pain, then lashes
out and rips away at the Beast. The Beast shrieks, then
throws itself up into the rafters and becomes Dracula, his
arm is torn and limp. The clock CHIMES.
108.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
I know who you are. Who controls
you. Join me! Join me and I'll cut
the strings that play you! I'll
give you your life back!

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

Anna clambers up onto a ledge just as Aleera lands next to
her. Anna starts backing up the precarious perch as Aleera
closes in. WE PAN UP to the FULL MOON and see CLOUDS ABOUT TO
OBSCURE IT.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

The Werewolf looks insanely hungry as it closes in on
Dracula, who is desperately backing away.

DRACULA
Don't you understand!? Four hundred
years ago we were friends.
Partners! Brothers!

The clock CHIMES. The Werewolf leaps at him. Dracula becomes
the Beast and desperately tries to flyaway, but he's too
damaged. The Werewolf grabs him by the throat, about to kill
him, and that's when the Werewolf turns back into Van
Helsing. Van Helsing quickly staggers back. Dracula looks out
at the roiling clouds obscuring the moon, then he looks at
Van Helsing. That old confident glint fills Dracula's eyes.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Did I mention that it was you who
murdered me?

EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - NIGHT

The clock CHIMES. Anna backs up against a wall on the ledge,
trapped. Aleera steps in for the kill.

ALEERA
Your blood shall make me even more
beautiful. What do you think of
that?

A SILVER STAKE suddenly impales her through the chest. Aleera
shrieks. Anna looks over at the bridge, to where Carl has
crawled down between the girders, then she looks back at
Aleera, who is staring at her in horror and starting to rot.
109.

ANNA
I think if you're going to kill
somebody, kill them, don't stand
around talking about it.

Aleera bursts into rot, the silver stake is flung into a beam
right next to Carl's head. The clock CHIMES. Carl looks up at
the clock.

CARL
How many is that? How many is
that!?

Anna is already racing up the parapet.

ANNA
Eight!

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Van Helsing desperately backs off through the FLAMING,
SPARKING equipment as Dracula slowly moves in on him.

DRACULA
All I wanted was life, Gabriel ...
now I'll have to take yours.

Dracula holds up his left hand, his ring finger has long ago
been CUT OFF.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
And I'll take my ring back as well.

The clock CHIMES. Van Helsing backs up into a wall, trapped,
breathing hard, the two men stare at each other. Dracula's
bicuspids distend into long fangs.

DRACULA (CONT'D)
Don't be afraid, Gabriel, now I
will give you back your life, your
memory.

And then through a window, Van Helsing sees the clouds about
to fully reveal the full moon. The clock CHIMES.

VAN HELSING
Some things are best left
forgotten.

Van Helsing becomes the Werewolf. He lunges, grabs Dracula
and CHOMPS into his throat. Dracula CRIES OUT in agony.
110.

Dracula starts shriveling and decaying and wasting away until
there is nothing left but charred remains burning into the
floor. The clock CHIMES.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

All of the pygmy bats shriek in horror and then explode into
black goo.

INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

Anna bursts into the room and races at the Werewolf's back,
syringe in hand, ready to stab him. The clock CHIMES.

ANNA
Twelve.

The Werewolf spins around and sees Anna coming. He POUNCES.
FANGS and CLAWS. Anna SCREAMS. The Werewolf tackles Anna.
They crash down onto a couch. Carl runs in and skids to a
stop, the Werewolf's back is to him, but he can see that it's
alive and on top of Anna.

CARL
Midnight.

Carl is devastated. He lifts up the silver stake.

CARL (CONT'D)
God forgive me.

He runs forward and swings the stake down at the Werewolf's
back. At the last millisecond the Werewolf spins around and
grabs Carl's wrist, stopping him short. Carl is terrified, he
stares at the Werewolf. The Werewolf stares back, then turns
slightly to reveal the SYRINGE sticking out of its chest,
empty. The Werewolf lets go of Carl. Carl stumbles back. The
Werewolf rips the empty syringe out of its chest, throws it
away, then looks down at Anna. Her eyes are wide open.

CARL (CONT'D)
She's dead.

And then WE CUT TO one of the most iconographic SHOTS in the
whole movie: the FULL MOON shines in through an arched stone
window, which frames the Werewolf, who is crouched over our
gorgeous heroine, sprawled dead across a broken couch.

WE SLOWLY PUSH IN as the Werewolf tilts its head back and
BAYS AT THE MOON, a long, mournful HOWL, it slowly TRANSFORMS
back into Van Helsing, CRYING OUT at the moon in anguish....
111.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAWN

Carl READS from the Bible, tears on his cheeks. Van Helsing,

carrying a torch, steps up to a funeral pyre. He stares down

at Anna, lying on the pyre, looking beautiful. WE CUT WIDE to
see that they ate on a bluff overlooking the SEA.

EXT. SEA — DAWN

A dark figure paddles a makeshift raft out to sea. It's
Frankenstein. He looks back up to the bluff to see the
flaming pyre IGNITE. Frankenstein doffs his hat in respect,
sighs heavily, then turns back around and continues paddling.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT

The glow from the flames flickers off Van Helsing's sad face
as he stares down at the ground. Carl still reading.

The SMOKE from the funeral pyre suddenly FORMS A PICTURE OF
ANNA'S FACE. Tendrils of smoke waft out, like long smoky
fingers they touch Van Helsing's chin and lift it up. Van
Helsing sees her. Anna smiles. Then her face starts to float
up into the dawn sky along with the rest of the smoke.

Van Helsing is shocked, he staggers forward, as if to follow.

Anna's face is suddenly surrounded by the vague faces of her
mother, her father, her brother Velkan, and many other
welcoming family members. Her father gives her a hug. Her
mother starts to comb her hair.

Carl smiles as he steps up and puts his hand on Van Helsing's
shoulder.

Anna gives Van Helsing one last look, her radiant eyes
beaming with happiness, and then she and all of her family
start to ascend into the glowing dawn sky.

Van Helsing stares upward, devastated.

And then in one final glorious moment, Anna and her family
swoop up into the sky and blend with the fading stars.

WE PUSH IN on Van Helsing's face as the look in his eyes
changes, from devastated loss, to a gentle look of peace. We
can see that he is truly happy for Anna ....

DISSOLVE TO:
112.

EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAWN

Van Helsing and Carl riding two black stallions across an
endless golden wheat field, heading off into a new dawn.

FADE OUT.

THE END
