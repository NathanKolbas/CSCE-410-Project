Her lips quiver as she |ooks at a YOUNG MOTHER (MARIE) and

toward her daughter -- screaning -- and falling. Angie

wat ches in horror as this woman is run over by the masses.

As she speaks, Rex orders Kevin to start airing wnat she’s

There’s a young nother, she’s lost her

In his viewinder, he sees KIDS waving at himfroma balcony.
Lowering the carrera, he waves back and here we get our first
glimpse of HOMRD LEWCKI. Md-40s, Lewcki is mid-life
crisis personified. Recently divorced, Lewcki is desperate
to recapture his youth as he wanders further in, taking in
the size and scope of the 100,000 people filling the Plaza.

Anid the masses, he is at once a part of the everyday and yet
conpl etely alone. He struggles wth the operations of his
canvorder -- intermittentl y/acci dentally triggering the

“TI ME/ DATE” function...as he records i mages along the
northwest side, near where the President is set to arrive.

Elsewhere, Lewcki’s camera finds a COUPLE making out. Alone,

they whisper | ovingl y to one another, the MAN | ooks into the

The APPLAUSE picks up but LEWCKI feels out of sorts. He

AGENTS BARNES & TAYLOR, and TWO OTHERS --

Lew cki sees his opening and steps forward, trying to worm
his way closer to the wal kway.

QN THE SECRET SERVI CE...BARNES & TAYLOR -- as they clear a
path for the PRESIDENT. Seeing Barnes, Lewcki stops; that’s
Thoras Barnes. Morentarily star-struck, he looks down at his
view screen, angling to get a better shot --

LEW CKI ( CONT’ D)
That’s...

--he stops himself, there’s no one to tell.

QN THE VI EW SCREEN. .. now held overhead as the Presi dent and
the Mayor meet. Once the President has shaken hands wth De
Soto, he turns to other leaders, working the photo-ops while
the Mayor moves to the podium quieting the crows...

DE SOTO
Buenos tardes. VWélcome. Thank you so
much for being here...this is a wondrous
day. Today, we make history!

THE CROWDS ERUPT. As the Mayor continues, Lewcki notices
that the SECRET SERVI CE AGENT (BARNES) appears to be
wi spering into his wist nic...

Ever the voyeur, Lewcki turns his attention to BARNES. te
follows the agent’s eyes --

DE SOTO ( CONT’ D)
... Senor Presidente, fellow menbers of
the European Union, President Ashton, and
citizens of the world, it is wth great
pleasure that | invite you all to our

-- Lewcki turns his canera around toward the back, trying to
see wnat BARNES is | ooking at. He searches the back wall...

ZOOM NG IN -- window by window until he sees

A MAN

standing inside a second story wndow. Lewcki hesitates.
That seems odd...Lewcki turns back to Barnes. Unsure of how
to act, Lewccki | ooks around; should he speak up? He

hesitates, glancing over to those around him Nb one else

no one’s in the Wndow. Anonentary pang of guilt...

LEW Ck|

Al\l_at once, he’s BUVPED and SHOVED. SCREAMS over whel m
PEOPLE stumble, as others push past, trying to get away.

Looking down at his hand, he feels the weight of his camera --

...he’s seen the shooter. He can’t quit now Standing his
ground, he raises the canera and begins filming again --

-- ZOOMNG IN --

-- he sees the SECRET SERVICE lifting the PRES! DENT, | eadi ng

BARNES, eyes wld, scanning the rooftops. He's barking
orders into his wist microphone but Lewcki can’t hear wnat
he’s saying...

-- tracking wth Barnes’ glance, Lewcki follows his eye line
over to TWO OTHER AGENTS -- JANKOMSKI & MATTHEVS as they drag
the man away woo charged toward the President. This is
ENRIQUE. CGearly local, Enrique has an earnest, decent
quality to his concern. Lewcki pushes closer, hearing...

Lew cki can’t stop himself now. Making up his mind, Lewcki
has to do something. He has to get involved. Just then --

Lew cki draws closer. He sees the ground rising as it | eads

higher. This is his adventure. He can’t quit now.

...Lewcki fights to keep going. He stumbles at the curb,
barely retaining his bal ance --

capt uring the whole thing. Qnly Enrique doesn’t move. te

Enrique races out, | ooking both ways. As he sprints, he

Enrique powers on, never letting up. He knocks over
PEDESTRI ANS, avoiding foot traffic as he jumps --

off. The vehicle brakes hard as he slides by. Nearing the

Enrique doesn’t stop.
