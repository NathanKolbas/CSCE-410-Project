White House Down

by

James Vanderbilt

March 1, 2012
FADE IN ON:
A snow globe.

Sitting on a little girl's desk. Inside it, among the water
and glitter, is a model of THE WHITE HOUSE.

The flakes swirl and gleam in the reflection of a night light.
Framed pictures on the desk. A little girl in front of the
Capitol. The Lincoln Memorial. We are in

INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cramped. EMILY CALE (10) slumbers. A stack of magazines by
her bed. US Weekly. Teen People. The Economist.

We hear a cell phone BOOP. Emily stirs. Checks her battered
first gen iPhone. An email notification. The screen reads:

President's Treaty With Iran Draws
Criticism at G8 Summit.

Emily goes to the CNN app. Pulls the covers over her head.
A kid sneaking TV, except in this case, it's not cartoons,
it's Wolf Blitzer:

WOLF BLITZER
...The proposed treaty with the newly
elected moderate President of Iran,
Mehrak Al-Said, is drawing huge
criticism for the Sawyer
administration. The President was
booed when he took the stage to speak
in Geneva over the weekend...

Drowned out by a LOW RUMBLING. Windows rattling. Emily's
bed begins SHAKING. Earthquake? Emily leaps up, huge smile
on her face. Throws the window open and looks up to see

A COLUMN OF HELICOPTERS thundering overhead! Three dark
green VH-3D Sea King choppers, each with United States of
America emblazoned on the side...

MARINE ONE
Leads the Presidential Motorcade of the sky. Emily looks up

in wonder as Marine One and her two thundering companions
bank East towards the dawn...
INT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - NIGHT

The cabin holds ten. Nine men in suits. One woman in the
front jump seat. Secret Service AGENT CAROL FINNERTY (30's).
Smart pant suit, gun on her hip. She keys her wrist mic:

FINNERTY
Castle, this is Hummingbird, we are
inbound from Andy, three minutes out--

AGENT GRIGGS
Carol?

Finnerty looks up to see Agent BRIAN GRIGGS across from her.

AGENT GRIGGS (CONT'D)
He wants to do the thing.

Finnerty sighs.

FINNERTY
Really?

AGENT GRIGGS
Really.

FINNERTY
Mr. President, it's not a good idea
to deviate from the flight plan...

She's now looking into the smiling face of PRESIDENT JAMES
SAWYER, the 46th Chief Executive of the United States.
Handsome, 40's, African-American.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Come on, Carol, pretty please? Leader
of the free world here, saying 'pretty
please' here. Oughta count for
something.

A beat. Finnerty keys her radio mic.
FINNERTY
Captain Joffrey, this is Agent
Finnerty? The President would like
to do the thing.

The others grin as the helicopter banks left...
EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - NIGHT

Beautifully illuminated. A JOGGER and his dog, huffing and
puffing by when

MARINE ONE sweeps in low overhead, coming down 23rd Street.
The two escort choppers playing follow-the-leader behind it,
circling the Memorial, saying hello to Mr. Lincoln.

The column of choppers turns East, flying out over the
reflecting pool! An air tour of the sights...

INT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - NIGHT

President Sawyer smiles in his seat as he watches Lincoln
recede. As they make a wide arc around the Washington
Monument, their destination comes into view --

THE WHITE HOUSE. All lit up. Spectacular.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Be it ever so humble...

FINNERTY
(into wrist walkie)
Castle, this is Hummingbird, we are
one minute out, I need a go/no go.

INT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - NIGHT

A structure on the North side of the White House Grounds, on
Pennsylvania Avenue. Inside, packed with electronics.

The GUARD sits hunched over a monitor system that shows dozens
of traffic camera feeds from the streets around the complex.

GATE GUARD
Hummingbird, this is Castle Ground,
you are clear.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

Low lit. Two dress MARINES sit in the outer office. A NAVY
RADAR TECH watches his screen sweep for nearby air traffic.

RADAR TECH
Hummingbird, this is Castle Sky, you
are clear.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

High atop the famous columned central building, a black clad
SNIPER TEAM scans the night sky with their rifle-scopes,
checking surrounding buildings for movement.

LEAD SNIPER
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep,
you are- Hold.

THROUGH HIS NIGHTSCOPE - We see movement on the eighth floor
balcony of a building a half mile away. He frowns. Enhances
magnification. The suspicious behavior comes into focus...

A couple having sex on their balcony. The Lead Sniper grins.

LEAD SNIPER (CONT'D)
Hummingbird, this is Castle Keep,
you are clear.

The column of helicopters swoops in, circling the South Lawn.
The Lead Chopper pulls a slow turn, coming in for a landing.
A pair of MARINES in dress blues come out to meet it.

The door does not open. The Chopper sits there for a good
twenty seconds as the snipers continue to scan. Then:

FINNERTY (0.S.)
(through radio)
Castle Keep?

LEAD SNIPER
Nothing.

FINNERTY (0.S.)
(through radio)
All right, Decoy up, Marine One in.

The chopper on the ground rises up and the second helicopter -
the real Marine One - swoops in for a landing on

EXT. WHITE HOUSE SOUTH LAWN - NIGHT

The MARINES open the door and President Sawyer steps off the
bird, flanked by Finnerty, Dawson, and aides. Sawyer snaps
the Marines a salute as they head for the White House.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
It's really not a bad way to travel,
is it?
FINNERTY
It beats Dupont Circle, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
When's my wife back?

FINNERTY
Not until tonight.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I'm gonna get some shut-eye. Wake
me if we need to attack anything.

In front of him, more Marines hold open the door to the West
colonnade. As the President passes them, walking inside:

MARINE GUARD
Welcome home, sir.

Finnerty looks back at Marine One as it lifts off the South
Lawn. An incredible sight. Griggs smiles next to her.

AGENT GRIGGS
Tell me we don't have the best job
in the world.
CUT TO:

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Two other Secret Service Agents stand a very different detail.
Guarding a broken down row house in Georgetown. The first
is handsome, close cropped hair. This is JOHN CALE (30's).

A HORRIBLE COUGHING comes from inside. Wheezy and phlegmy,
like a grown man trying to hack up a furball.

RAPHELSON (0.S.)
Oh, God...

The coughing resumes. Awful. The agents wince. Then:

RAPHELSON (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Is there any kleenex out there?

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
Clutching a box of kleenex, Cale raps on the bathroom door.

It opens and ELI RAPHELSON (70) sticks his head out. Clad
in a ratty bathrobe, still wheezing.
RAPHELSON
Thank you, John. When I'm done in
here, I'll make you some coffee.

CALE
I'm fine, Mr. Speaker-

RAPHELSON
I insist.

INT. RAPHELSON'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Raphelson stands at the stove, mixing what looks to be the
world's worst cup of instant coffee. A TV tuned to CNN
replays the President's Geneva Speech:

PRESDIENT SAWYER

(on TV)
...-There are those who will say we
are foolish, those who treat every
opportunity for peace as a show of
weakness. To them I say I have found
a friend in President Al-Said. And
together, we will prove that the pen
truly is mightier than the sword.

Applause mixed with boos. Raphelson adds way too much cream
to the coffee. Looks to Cale.

RAPHELSON
What do you think of all this?

CALE
I don't know, sir. It's good to
have less enemies.

RAPHELSON
All he's doing is legitimizing them.
Geopolitics is chess, not checkers;
you have to see the whole board.
The President is very naive sometimes.

CALE
Why didn't you run against him?

RAPHELSON
Because that is the one job I never
wanted. I like my constituents, I
like being a thorn in the side of
the administration. Not all of us
are looking to move up.

(MORE )
RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
(casual)
You have your interview today?

Cale looks at him, surprised.

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
I know you want to be on the
President's detail. Are you not
pleased with your life of excitement
and adventure here?

CALE
Sir, I- I appreciate everything you've
done for me, but-

RAPHELSON
It's all right, son. It's good to
have ambition. I'll be sorry to see
you go is all. This may not be the
White House, but there's coffee.

He slides a mug over to Cale. Cale takes a sip. Awful.
Hides it well. He likes the old guy. Raphelson nods, happy.

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
I'm gonna get a shower.

EXT. RAPHELSON'S HOUSE - DAWN

Now in a suit, Raphelson climbs behind the wheel of his
battered Toyota Camry and fires it up. Cale slides into the
SUV idling behind him - the follow car. Into his wrist:

CALE
Pinball is rolling, we are enroute
to Punchbowl.

As they roll out after Raphelson, we pan around to see their
destination in the distance, what "Punchbowl" really is

THE U.S. CAPITOL DOME. Silhouetted against the rising sun...
INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN

McLean, Virginia. An alarm clocks wails. The lone figure
wakes. This is MARTIN BISHOP (late 50's). Fit, trim. He
sits a moment. Alone in a house for two. Then rises.

A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS - Bishop showers, shaves. Pulls on

pants, a button down shirt. Selects a tie. Withdraws a
GLOCK. Checks the load. Straps it into his shoulder holster.
A small silver cross hangs from his mirror. He takes it.
Slips it around his neck. Looks at himself.

He stands there for a long time.

Bishop takes the cross off. Hangs it back on the mirror.
Pulls on his suit coat and is out the door.

EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAWN

Cale and Dunleavy shadow a briskly walking Raphelson as he
climbs the famous steps. Cale, scanning passersby for any
sign of potential threat. Everything okay until he spies

A long haired FIDGETY GUY. He keeps scratching his beard
and eyeing the Speaker. Cale, about to say something when
the Fidgety Guy suddenly reaches into his coat and --

TIME SLOWS DOWN. Cale pivots to block Raphelson, his own
hand drifts to the holster on his hip, about to pull, but
Fidgety Guy's faster and his gun hand emerges brandishing

A banana. Fidgety Guy's breakfast. Cale exhales.

DUNLEAVY
You okay there, Tex? Too much coffee?

Cale doesn't respond. They head up the steps and inside.
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

Raphelson walks the halls, saying hello to various Congressmen
as they arrive for work. Stepping into a big office where
AGENTS KELLERMAN and BRIGHT stands guard. Cale steps up.

CALE
He watched Jeopardy, went to bed to
at 8:00, got up to pee twice, and is
still having that allergy thing. We
need to start keeping kleenex in the
downstairs bathroom. He's all yours.

AGENT KELLERMAN
I'll try not to die of excitement.

Cale smiles. Heads down the hall to an even bigger office...
INT. OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT - MORNING

Hustle and bustle. An assistant sits at the front desk,
rolling calls. JENNA (30's), sweet and flirty.
JENNA
Office of the Vice President. Hold
please.

She sees Cale and flashes him her best smile.

CALE
Did you get them?

JENNA
What do I get if I did?

CALE
What do you want?

JENNA
Dinner, candlelight, and a sincere
promise that you'll try to get to
second base.

CALE
Done.

She hands him an envelope and a card with her phone number
on it. Cale looks inside the envelope.

CALE (CONT'D)

She's gonna love these, Jenna.

Thanks!
He kisses her on the cheek and is out the door...
INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - MORNING
Emily sits at the kitchen table, sullenly picking at her
cereal. Her mother MELANIE (30's, hard), mixes vodka from
the freezer in with her morning OJ. The former Mrs. Cale.

A knock on the door. Melanie opens it. Cale.

MELANIE
You're late. She thought you weren't
coming.

CALE
Of course I was coming. Emily, get
your stuff.

Emily grabs her bag and heads out the door. As she passes
Cale he tries to kiss her on the forehead, but she dodges.
Melanie smiles at this. A small victory for her side.
10.

MELANIE
You missed her talent show.
CALE
When was her talent show?
MELANIE
Thursday.
CALE

What did she do?

MELANIE
She was a flag twirler.

CALE
That's a talent?

MELANIE
She practiced for like six weeks and

her own father can't be bothered to
show up...

INT. CALE'S CAR - MORNING

Emily, sitting in the car, listening to her parents fight.
Old news. She slips on her headphones...

INT. RUNDOWN APARTMENT - MORNING
Cale nods to the vodka bottle.

CALE
Getting an early start, I see.

MELANIE
Why not? It's my day off.

Cale has a retort, but swallows it. Instead:

CALE
Listen, I wanted to talk about custody-

MELANIE
I'm sure you do. That way you don't
have to cut me that check every month-

CALE
You really think this is about the
checks, Mel?
11.

He stares at her drink. She shifts her weight from one foot
to the other, then shakes her head and chuckles.

MELANIE
Jesus, John. She doesn't even like
you.
That lands. Hard.
CALE

You have a good day.
INT. CALE'S CAR - MORNING

Cale gets into the driver's seat. Emily listening to music,
checking the Drudge Report on her phone. Cale looks at her.

CALE
You pissed at me?

She doesn't even look up at him. Hell hath no fury.

CALE (CONT'D)
You gonna be on that thing all day?

She's texting now. After a moment, Cale's own phone chimes.
He checks it. Text from Emily - Yes.

CALE (CONT'D)
I'm so glad I got you that phone.

(sighs)
Well, I guess you won't be wanting
these then...

He puts the envelope from Jenna on the dash. A beat.

EMILY
Lame.

CALE
You don't even know what it is.

EMILY
Do you really think that's going to
work? We're both adults here, John.

CALE
Speak for yourself. Open the
envelope.

EMILY

What is it?
12.

CALE
A pony. Just open it.

Dubious, Emily opens the envelope. Her face lights up.

EMILY
Are you serious? I didn't think
they even gave White House tours
anymore!

CALE
They don't. It's a six month waiting
list unless you know people. I
thought a budding policy wonk like
you might want to see where the most
powerful man in the world lives.

She looks up at him. Genuinely happy.

EMILY
This is really cool, John.

CALE
(starting the car)
We're really sticking with the John
thing, huh?

As Emily nods, they pull out into traffic...
INT. CALE'S CAR (MOVING) - MORNING
Cale drives as Emily surfs her phone.

CALE
Listen, when we get there I have to
go to a quick meeting, okay? Then
we can go on the tour.

EMILY
(reading off her phone)
Did you know that 1.5 million people
visit the White House every year?

CALE
I did not.
EMILY
That works out to about 5000 people
a day.
CALE
Fascinating.

(MORE )
13.

CALE (CONT'D)
(pause)
I'm sorry I missed your talent show.

EMILY
I'm not. Did you know the White
House was originally called the
Presidential Palace?

CALE
I'm serious. I wish I'd been there.

EMILY
No you, don't. All I did was twirl
a flag, it was stupid.

Cale looks at her.

CALE

You don't have to do that, you know.
EMILY

What?
CALE

Have a thick skin. You're ten.
Emily doesn't respond. A beat.

CALE (CONT'D)
Did you really think I wasn't coming?

But Emily's not looking at him, she's looking at...

EMILY
Oh, wow...

THE WHITE HOUSE. Approaching from the South Side, with the
fountain blasting. Enough to take Emily's breath away.
Cale smiles at her reaction, driving up to

EXT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - MORNING

Cale pulls up to the massive guard gate. The Officer in
Charge leans out of the structure.

GATE GUARD
Morning folks! Gonna need some photo
ID!

Cale hands it over. Instantly two other guards appear from
nowhere, each holding long mirrors at the end of poles.
14.
They sweep the bottom of the car for explosives.

One guard checks the trunk while the other roots through the
back seat. Emily takes a picture of him with her phone.

EMILY
What are you guys looking for?

GATE GUARD 2
Explosives.

EMILY
This is awesome.

GATE GUARD

(handing ID's back)
Park up on the left and you're going
to the East Lobby. Have a good one.

Cale drives on.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE PARKING LOT - MORNING

Cale pulls to a halt next to a parked SOUNDTEK van. A HUGE
MAN with a SHAVED HEAD is pulling a large speaker box out of
the back onto a dolly. Cale, watching him...

EMILY
Did you know the President travels
in an eight ton military armored
modified Cadillac CTS, built to
withstand gas, chemical, and missile
attacks?

CALE
That's on the internet?

EMILY
Wikipedia. You guys are doing a
bang-up job with the secrecy thing.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST LOBBY - MORNING

Honey wood panelling. A GUARD DESK to the right, by set of
metal detectors. Beyond, two more security checkpoints. X-
ray, body scan, bag search, facial rec. Serious stuff.

On the walls hang Presidential Portraits. Roosevelt.
Eisenhower. They lived here. Emily stares at them as Cale
loads their stuff into the x-ray machine.
15.

SECURITY OFFICER
Welcome to the White House! We're
going to take you through three levels
of security today. First, I'm going
to need to empty your pockets - all
metal objects in the tray please.
Cell phones and cameras are permitted
on the premises, but need to be
examined by the agents first!

OVERALLED WORKMEN lay tools on the x-ray belt. Photo ID's
checked against internet records. Cale, to the officer:

CALE
I'm Secret Service, off duty, I'm
carrying.
SECURITY OFFICER
You're going to have to check your
weapon, sir.
The officer produces a LOCKBOX. Cale unholsters his Glock
and places it inside. The officer locks it and hands it to
an AGENT. As Cale and Emily continue through security...

CAMERA FOLLOWS the Agent carrying the lockbox, as he takes
it down into the bowels of the White House. Down a

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BACK STAIRCASE - MORNING
Concrete stairs, dimly lit. Past another agent into

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING BASEMENT - MORNING

A dark carpeted hallway. Down the corridor, round a corner...
INT. WHITE HOUSE ARMORY - MORNING

A WEAPONS CAGE. The Armory Master looks up briefly as the
Agent logs in Cale's lockbox. Pan off this to the countless
ASSAULT RIFLES and SHOTGUNS locked behind steel mesh...

INT. BACK OFFICES - MORNING

Cale and Emily sit, waiting. Awkward silence again. Emily
on her phone, surfing. After a beat:

CALE
How's school?

EMILY
School blows.
16.

CALE
I'm glad we can have these talks.

The outer office door opens and Finnerty enters.

CALE (CONT'D)
(whispering to Emily)

Do me a favor, for the next twenty

seconds pretend you don't hate me.

FINNERTY
John Cale? I'm Carol Finnerty, I
run the President's detail.

CALE
(vising)
This is my daughter Emily.

EMILY
My father is a very special man.

FINNERTY
That's... good to know. If you'll
follow me?

INT. FINNERTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
Finnerty settles in behind her desk as Cale takes a seat.

FINNERTY
You often bring small children to
job interviews?

CALE
Diversionary tactic. While I'm in
here, she's out there stealing
everything that's not nailed down.
(no response)
Sorry, that was a joke.

FINNERTY

All evidence to the contrary.
CALE

Sorry?
FINNERTY

Mr. Cale, I'm going on seventeen
hours of no sleep, so let's just get
through this, okay?

She opens the file sitting in front of her and reads.
She looks

17.

FINNERTY (CONT'D)

John Cale, born 1983, Columbus, Ohio,
public school, track and field, and
then one single solitary semester at
San Diego State University. Married
your childhood sweetheart five months
later, bounced from job to job.
Mechanic, limo driver, construction-

CALE
Is my credit score in there too?

FINNERTY
Yes, and you should be ashamed of
yourself. You finally landed in the
Army Reserve. Enlisted for the bonus.

CALE
Is that a crime?

FINNERTY
We tend to prefer God and Country to
"in it for the paycheck". Did two
tours in Afghanistan, was wounded in
the Kunar Province, received the
Purple Heart. A Lance Corporal Brian
Dawson put you up for a Silver Star,
but you did not receive it.

CALE
It's an honor just to be nominated.

FINNERTY
You pulled Corporal Dawson from a
burning Humvee. Why?

CALE
I was somewhat concerned he was
getting too warm in there.

at him.

FINNERTY
It's funny to me that you think glib
is the way to go here.

CALE
There was an IED attack, the Humvee
flipped, and we were taking fire.
Everyone else bolted, I grabbed him.
18.

FINNERTY
Why?
CALE
Because we don't leave men behind.

(pause)
And he owed me money.

FINNERTY
Corporal Dawson happens to be the
nephew of the Speaker of the House.
And when you were discharged from
the Army, the Speaker urged you to
go into the Secret Service.

CALE
He was kind enough to recommend me
for a job.

FINNERTY

You're on the Speaker's detail now.
He did you a favor.

CALE
You could say that.

FINNERTY
I did. Why do you want to be on the
President's detail?

CALE
Nothing against the Speaker, but no
one's ever going to take a shot at
him. This is the big leagues.

She studies him.

FINNERTY
Look, I appreciate your service, but
this is clearly the record of a man
who's slid by mostly on looks, charm,
and favors-

CALE
Mostly on the looks, actually-

FINNERTY
-And as you say, this is the big
leagues.
19.

CALE
I know I've bounced around, but this
is something I can do. Giving
yourself up for something greater
than you... that's what I need.

FINNERTY
I'm sorry, but the Secret Service is
not somewhere to find yourself.
Thanks for coming in.

She rises and offers her hand. Cale blinks. Surprised it's
over. Rises too. Shakes and turns to the door.

INT. BACK OFFICES - MORNING
Emily looks up as Cale emerges.

EMILY
How'd it go?

Cale's face says it all...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - WEST LOBBY - MORNING

Finnerty strides through the lobby, passing the Photo Office
and Homeland Security. Keycards through another door into

INT. OFFICE OF SECRET SERVICE - MORNING
The on-site security hub of the White House.

40 odd agents, some in uniform, some in suit and tie, stand,
drinking coffee, talking with each other. Shift change coming
up, but before that, the morning briefing.

Finnerty slides into the back of the room as MARTIN BISHOP
walks to the front. Head of the Secret Service. The Boss.

BISHOP
All right, listen up. First and
most importantly, who owes me money
on the Wizards?

Grumbling throughout the agents, some come forward and hand
him cash.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
That's right. Thank you. I hope
you've all learned a valuable lesson
here. Okay, light day.

(MORE )
20.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Eagle is not leaving the Castle.
Phone calls with the leadership
staring at nine, photo spray with
the Duke women's lacrosse team at
noon, lunch with the Vice President,
and then the First Lady is back
tonight. Ted?

AGENT TED HOPE (40's), prematurely balding speaks up.

AGENT HOPE
Empress is wheels down at 18:45.
They're supposed to have dinner of
the residence but...

He spreads his hands - "You know how they are".

BISHOP
Assuming they call an audible on
going out, we need to have advance
on Dino, Obelisk, and Marcel's.

AGENT HOPE
What if she wants sushi?

From the back of the room, Finnerty speaks up:
FINNERTY

No, she's off sushi, she had that
thing on the Japan trip.

BISHOP
Jesus, Carol, how are you still awake?
FINNERTY
Five Hour Energy Drink and patriotism,
sir.
BISHOP

You have a Threat Matrix for us?

FINNERTY
Homeland says a guy they were sitting
on in Toronto went missing 36 hours
ago, they think he might have crossed.

BISHOP
This guy a lone nut or well financed
horseman of the apocalypse?
21.

FINNERTY
College student with a blog, thinks
the WTO caused 9/11.

BISHOP
He's onto us. Okay, distribute the
photo. Visitors today?

AGENT HOPE
We have Representatives Fiske, Holden,
Rafferty, and Senators Simon and
Truesdale coming in for a budget
meeting at 15:00, plus Soundtek is
here again today.

FINNERTY
Soundtek?

AGENT HOPE
AV guys, they're replacing the
surround system in the movie theater.
Eagle wants it ready for football on
Sunday. From all accounts, they are
teeth rattlingly loud.

FINNERTY
The First Lady should be thrilled.

BISHOP
All right, that's game. Grab an
Order of the Day and let's get to
work.

The Agents grab top-sheets from a stack by the coffee. As
they file out Finnerty approaches Bishop.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
For the love of all that is holy, go
get some sleep.

FINNERTY
I'm going.
(as he watches the
Agents file out)
You know you're going to miss this.

BISHOP
I'm not, actually.

FINNERTY
I can tell when you're lying, you
know. We're gonna miss you, too.
22.
Bishop smiles at her. A little sad.

BISHOP
All that time in Switzerland, it
would have killed you to bring Muriel
back a cuckoo clock?

FINNERTY
On your desk.
(she turns to go)
Twenty bucks says they pick Marcel's
tonight.

BISHOP
I wouldn't bet against you.

Bishop, watching her go. Something eating at him...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST LOBBY - MORNING

Cale and Emily stand with a tour group of ten. At the front
stands DONNIE THE TOUR GUIDE (40's). Way too chipper.

DONNIE THE GUIDE

I'm Donnie and I'm going to be your
guide today as we take a walk through
American History! First I want to
give you a big Washington DC welcome
to the White House, where we get
millions of guests a year from all
corners of the globe!

(to Cale)
Where are you folks from?

CALE
Washington DC.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Okay, bad choice.
(to a Fat Woman)
How about you, ma'am?

FAT WOMAN
I'm from North Carolina.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
And what brings you to the White
House today?

FAT WOMAN
I wanna see the tunnels where JFK
snuck Marilyn Monroe in.
23.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Unfortunately, those don't exist.
(the Fat Woman is
crestfallen)
But we do have some other really
exciting sights to show you! If
you'll follow me?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - GARDEN ROOM - DAY

A beautiful solarium with a corner windows looking out onto
the South Lawn of the White House. Bright and sunny. As
Donnie talks he leads them through.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Does anyone want to guess how old
the White House is?
(sees Emily raising
her hand)
Young lady?

EMILY
221 years old.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
That's... very accurate. Construction
was begun in 1792 on what was then
called the President's House. Article
One, Section Eight of the US
Constitution set forth that a district
of not more than ten miles square
should house the new seat of
government. Does anyone know why?

EMILY
So no one state could claim the
President's House.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Right again. The founders were
crafty. They figured if the President
lived in one state then he would be
beholden to that state above all
others. But if he lived in a district
separate from all of them, then he
and his government could serve all
the United States equally and fairly.
In many ways, the entire city of
Washington, the whole District of
Columbia, was built from the ground
up in order to hold this one house.
24.
As they step into
INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST COLONNADE - MORNING

A long white corridor with a red brick floor wall of windows
looking out to the South Lawn.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
The White House is actually three
buildings; the East Wing, where you
came in, the West Wing, which houses
the Oval and Executive offices of
the President, and the Residence,
which is the big famous building in
the center. These three buildings
are connected by two long hallways
called colonnades; we're in the East
Colonnade right now. The colonnades
were originally built by Thomas
Jefferson to house horses, but now
function to connect the complex
together. And trust me, it needs
connecting - the White House is big.
Including below ground levels, the
White House is six stories tall,
with 132 rooms, 412 doors, 147
windows, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases,
3 elevators and 35 bathrooms. The
grounds contain a tennis court, a
basketball court, a putting green, a
jogging track, and a swimming pool.

They pass an open door, hearing hammering and drilling.

FAT WOMAN
What's in there?

DONNIE THE GUIDE
The President's home theater.
(smiles)
Membership has it's privileges.

Cale glances inside, as seven burly SOUNDTEK WORKMEN drills
holes into the walls of the theater...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING
Another part of the building. PRESIDENT SAWYER sweeps down

the hallway, the Chief of Staff and Bishop at his side.
Walking through an open door into
25.
INT. OVAL OFFICE - OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

The PRESIDENT'S ASSISTANTS sit at three desks and the door
to the Oval proper is guarded by a DRESS MARINE holding an M-
16. To the Marine:

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Morning, Kenny.

DRESS MARINE
Morning, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
The New York Times called my treaty
a boondoggle this morning. You read
the New York Times, Kenny?

DRESS MARINE
I'm more of a Daily News man, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Bill, we need to talk to the Secretary
of the Navy about getting Kenny a
raise. Margaret, can you get me the
Speaker of the House please? I sense
a lecture in my future...

As the President steps into the Oval Office itself...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - VISITORS' FOYER - MORNING

Cale, Emily, and the rest of the tour exit the Colonnade
into the Visitor's Foyer as Donnie continues.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Besides being a national landmark,
the White House also happens to be a
technological marvel. Underneath
the West Wing is the Situation Room,
the most sophisticated military
command center in the history of
warfare. And underneath the East
Wing is the PEOC or Presidential
Emergency Operations Center, the
single most secure room on the planet.
It's a vault built behind ten feet
of concrete and steel capable of
surviving a thermonuclear blast and
equipped so the President and his
staff could run the country from
inside for six months without leaving.
CALE
So where's the bowling alley?

DONNIE THE GUIDE
(completely serious)
Next to the Vault.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE GUARD HOUSE - MORNING

26.

Finnerty, leaving the complex on foot. The kindly old Gate

Guard smiles at her as she goes.

GATE GUARD
See you tomorrow, Carol!

Finnerty turns west onto Pennsylvania Avenue...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING

A long hallway with dramatically vaulted arched ceilings

that runs length of the Residence Building.

DONNIE THE GUIDE

We're now entering the Center Hall
of the Residence. The President and
First Lady live on the second and
third floors, the Ground Floor and
State Floor are dedicated to public
rooms. To your left is the Library
and to your right is the Vermeil
Room, which houses the portraits of
several of the most prominent First
Lady's who have lived here. Pictures
are actually permitted, so snap away.

Emily goes to take pictures of the Vermeil Room.
how happy she is.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Yours?

CALE
Nah, I found her sulking around
outside, thought if I brought her
it'd make me look smart.

Cale watches

The woman smiles. Cute. Maybe the day isn't a total loss.
She sees one of the paintings on the wall. One of a blackened

White House. Donnie comes over.
27.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
Watercolor by George Munger. It's
to commemorate the burning of the
White House by the British in 1814.

CALE
The White House burned down?

DONNIE THE GUIDE
In the war of 1812. It practically
had to be rebuilt from the ground
up.

A tugging on Cale's arm.
EMILY

I think I need to avail myself of
one of the 35 bathrooms in here.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
There's a ladies room upstairs, but
I can't take the tour up there for
another fifteen minutes.

CALE
I'll take her. Where?

EMILY
I can go by myself, John. I'm nota
little girl.

Cale looks at her. Sighs. Deciding.

CALE
Okay, but don't touch anything, don't
wander off, and don't talk to anyone
you're not supposed to.

EMILY
I make no promises.

She goes. Cale steps into the Vermeil Room to look around...
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING
The Speaker's ASSISTANT pokes her head in.
SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
Mr. Speaker, I have the President

calling for you.

Raphelson snatches up his phone.
28.

RAPHELSON
Mr. President! I'm impressed with
all your treaty signings you find
time for little old me!

INTERCUT with the Oval Office:

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You do Jewish Mother's guilt very
well, Eli.

RAPHELSON
I just find it interesting that you
would announce the signing of a major
treaty with a sworn enemy of our
country before, you know, mentioning
it to anyone in Congress.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
It's the right thing to do, Eli.
We're never gonna get a better chance
at progress with Iran than right
now.

RAPHELSON
Which would be wonderful if I didn't
just have to take your word for it...
We PAN out of the office and into the hall...
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING CORRIDORS - MORNING

...Where we pick up the FIDGETY GUY from earlier walking
past. Moving with purpose. On his way to

INT. CAPITOL DOME - MORNING

The corridor opens into the enormous room beneath the famed
CAPITOL ROTUNDA. Sunlight streams in. Various STATUES.
Lincoln. Martin Luther King. Tourists snap photos.

The Fidgety Man stops in front of one particular bronze
statue. Looks at the name on the base. George Washington.
The Fidgety Man checks his watch.

It is 9:17 a.m.
The man leans down and begins to untie his shoes. Then he

removes them. Places them carefully on the floor. Then his
socks. A GUARD notices. This guy is undressing.
29.

CAPITOL SECURITY GUARD
Uh, sir?

The Man is now unbuttoning his shirt. Muttering to himself.

CAPITOL SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
Sir, you can't do that-

The Guard stops. The man has unbuttoned his shirt. He is
wearing a VEST OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES beneath it.

The Guard stares at him, numb. The Fidgety Man raises his
hand. Detonator in it. Exhales. Their eyes meet...

And then the air is filled with fire.
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING

A muffled WHOOMP! The whole building ROCKS. Raphelson is
thrown sideways against his desk, still clutching the phone.

RAPHELSON
Jesus!

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(through phone)
Eli, are you all right?

RAPHELSON
I'm fine, I- sir, I think there may
have been an explosion here-

He opens his door to the outer office - CHAOS. Glass and
debris everywhere. Smoke pouring in from the hallway...

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
Oh, God.

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - MORNING
Finnerty hears the explosion before she sees it. Car alarms
going off. In the distance - Smoke is rising from the Capitol
Rotunda. Finnerty begins to run towards it...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
PRESIDENT SAWYER
(into phone)
Eli?

Bishop getting information from his earpiece:
30.

BISHOP
Mr. President, there's been an
explosion at that Capitol, you need
to hang up the phone.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?

BISHOP
(into wrist)
We are crashing the White House,
repeat, the White House is crashed.

Bishop takes the phone from Sawyer and hangs it up as the
door opens and THREE AGENTS with SHOTGUNS suddenly come into
the room. The DRESS MARINE behind him, wielding his M-16.

The Marine bolts the door to the Oval Office as a KLAXON
sounds throughout the complex...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING

Cale looks up at the siren as a SECRET SERVICE AGENT steps
into the room, blocking the exit.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Everybody please stay where you are.
We're briefly restricting movement
through the facility, shouldn't be
more than a few minutes-

CALE
(tries to move past)
My daughter's upstairs-

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
I'm sorry, sir, no one moves until
they lift the crash.

CALE
I'm an agent on the Speaker's detail-

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Then you understand the protocol -
nobody moves.

Cale stares at him. A couple from Tennessee snaps his
picture. This is very exciting.
31.
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING

Raphelson hangs up the phone and looks to his Secret Service
Agent, who's talking on his own phone.

AGENT KELLERMAN
The White House is crashed, sir!

RAPHELSON
Where's the Vice President?

AGENT KELLERMAN
In his office, I think-

RAPHELSON
(to his Assistant)
Get him on the phone, tell him he
needs to institute Continuity of
Government-

SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
What 's-

RAPHELSON
In the event of an attack, all
principals in the line of succession
are moved to Secondary Locations and
a new communications band is put
online-

SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
I have the Vice President's Office,
sir!
(listens; then)
He can't come to the phone, he was
cut by some glass.

RAPHELSON
Glass? Tell him he needs to institute
COG-

ANOTHER EXPLOSION throws them sideways. Agent Kellerman
looks out the window.

AGENT KELLERMAN
Jesus Christ, the building's on
fire...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL THEATER - MORNING

A YOUNG SECRET SERVICE AGENT stands in the doorway to the
theater among the Soundtek Workmen, enforcing the crash.
32.
YOUNG AGENT
Don't worry, they do drills like
this every other week.
(smiles)
Picked the wrong day to come to work
here, huh?
The man with the shaved head, STENZ, smiles back. Not nice.

STENZ
Guess so.

And he raises a NAIL GUN and buries three bolts into the
Agent's chest!

The others move fast, professionals. They strip the man of
his weapon and hand the gun to Stenz. Syncing their watches --

STENZ (CONT'D)
Armory, sixty seconds, go!

-- And they spring out of the Theater into
INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST COLONNADE - MORNING

Running full tilt for the East Lobby. The Security Officer
at the end of the Colonnade looks up.

SECURITY OFFICER
We're in a crash, you can't-

BLAM-BLAM! Stenz shoots him twice in the head! His partner
raises his walkie to his lips, screaming:

SECURITY OFFICER 2
Shots fired! Code Black, Code-

BLAM! He goes down too as Stenz's right hand man HUMPHRIES
scoops their weapons and they KICK through the side door to
the back stairs...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WOMEN'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Emily looks up at the shots...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING

Cale automatically reaches for his hip to find his holster
EMPTY. The Agent with Cale's tour shouting into his wrist:

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Repeat, please repeat!
33.
CALE
(incredulous)
He said shots fired, it's an AOP!

He moves for the door but the Agent draws his weapon.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Stay back!

CALE
Goddammit, you need to get out there!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - ARMORY - MORNING

The Armory Master pulls a SHOTGUN from the wall and racks
it, spinning just in time for the door to be kicked open!

Stenz comes in low, firing three rounds into the Armory
Master's legs! The man crumples. Humphries hefts the ARC-
WELDER and goes to work on the cage door. SPARKS FLY.

STENZ
Thirty seconds!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - VERMEIL ROOM - MORNING
SECRET SERVICE AGENT

I have to wait for orders! We don't

know what's happening-
More GUNFIRE from upstairs. The Agent turns, distracted --
And suddenly Cale is moving, bringing his fist up and taking
the Agent down with a right cross! Grabs the Agent's gun.
Checks the magazine, looking to Donnie:

CALE
My daughter, where'd you send her?

DONNIE
Upstairs, across the Hall second
door on the left-

CALE
Stay here!

He bolts from the room...
INT. WHITE HOUSE ARMORY - MORNING

The Armory Cage door clanks the ground, and STENZ'S TEAM
pours into the armory.
34.

Quick cuts of them loading up - M-16's, MP-5's, shotguns,
flash grenades...

STENZ
Positions in two minutes, go!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST STAIRWELL - MORNING
Cale, bounding up the stairs two at a time...
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING
Agent Kellerman looks to Raphelson as he hears the news:
AGENT KELLERMAN
We have gunfire in the White House,
sir!
Raphelson scoops up the phone and dials. Into it:
RAPHELSON
This is Speaker of the House Eli
Raphelson, on behalf of the President
of the United States I am instituting
Continuity of Government...
EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING
A bright shiny day. ROTORS spinning up.

The Navy pilot tosses his pre-flight check and yanks back on
the stick as MARINE ONE rises into the air...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Agent Hope looks up to Bishop and the President.

AGENT HOPE
Marine One is three minutes out-

BISHOP
No, we have to get him to the PEOC!

AGENT HOPE
They're in the damn building, we
need to exfil-

BISHOP
Mr. President, we don't know if they
have surface to air missile
capability, they could blow us out
(MORE )
35.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
of the sky! We get you to the Vault
and their game is over!

President Sawyer stares at for him a moment, then gives him
a nod. The agents rack their shotguns. Bishop checks his
Glock, safety off. Like a posse headed out for the OK Corral.
BISHOP (CONT'D)
All right everyone - stay low, stay
close, shoot first, got it? On me!

He kicks the Oval Office door open and he and his team plunge
out into the West Wing corridors...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR - CENTER HALL - MORNING

A STAMPEDE of people pouring out the Main Entrance onto the
North Portico. Cale reaches the top of the stairs, pushing
through them, scanning their faces for his daughter.

CALE
Emily! Emily!

He spies the bathroom door. Shoulders through it...
INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Cale bursts in. No one. Checks the stalls. Nothing. She
must have run. Shit. He barrels back out --

INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - MORNING

Cale pushes out the door when -- MACHINE GUNFIRE nearly takes
his head off!

One of Stenz's men on the far side of the hall! The rest of
the onlookers scream and scatter as Cale dives back inside!

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Cale ducks to the floor as bullets punch through the bathroom!
Ripping through the tiles, splintering the porcelain! Water
sprays from busted pipes in the sink.

Slowly the ruined door is kicked open and Stenz's man RITTER
enters, holding an MP-5. Cale cowers on the floor.

CALE
Please, please don't kill me! I'm
just with the tour!
36.

RITTER
You had a gun.

CALE
I didn't! I didn't have a gun!
Please, I have a daughter, I-
He raises the gun and shoots Ritter TWICE in the chest!
Ritter pitches forward, pulling the trigger on his machine
gun as he dies, and Cale manages to roll away through the
bloody water as sinks and mirrors explode!

CALE (CONT'D)
Jesus!

Cale scoops up Ritter's rifle and stumbles for the door...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING

Bishop and his team hustle the President through the West
Wing offices, screaming:

BISHOP
Move, move, make a hole!

People dive out of the way as they come. Passing Secretaries
wiping hard drives, pouring water on keyboards, in some cases
taking FIRE AXES to their computers in attempt to data-dump...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - GUARD HOUSE - MORNING

The Gate Guard, on the phone with the police as visitors
pour out of the building across the South Lawn.

GATE GUARD
(into phone)
No, send all available units now!

The CLICK of pistol cocking behind him. He turns. Stenz,
holding the Glock to his head.

STENZ
One chance. Open the gate.

GATE GUARD
I can't-

BLAM! Stenz steps over the man's body and keys in the code.
The huge iron gate rumbles open and
37.

TWO SEMI-TRUCKS hauling TRAILERS rumble through the gates
and up the South Drive...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

The Sniper Team sees the trucks rolling up the drive.
Sighting the lead driver, tapping his throat-mic:

LEAD SNIPER
This is Castle Keep, we have a breach
at the North Entrance-

The roof door bangs open behind him and they turn --

As Stenz's man MULCAHY bursts through, opening fire,
OBLITERATING the White House Sniper Team in a hail of bullets!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH PORTICO - MORNING

The trucks rumble up the North Drive unimpeded and pull toa
halt in front of the North Portico. The DRIVERS leap out
and open up the back of the trailers where

DOZENS of heavily armed MERCENARIES in body armor pour out
and swarm up the steps and into the White House...

Behind them, a lone THIN MAN IN GLASSES steps out of the
truck. Sucks on an inhaler and surveys the scene...

INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SPEAKER'S OFFICE - MORNING

AGENT KELLERMAN
There's a firefight on the roof of
the White House and the North Entrance
has been breached!

RAPHELSON
Holy God...

SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
(hanging up phone)
Mr. Speaker, we have to go! The
Capitol Rotunda's on fire!
Off Raphelson's look of disbelief...
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - MORNING

Finnerty sprinting flat-out. Holding her phone to her ear.
Ahead of her we see the unthinkable --
38.

THE CAPITOL DOME is ENGULFED IN FLAMES. Windows explode
outwards from the heat of the inferno within.

FINNERTY
(into phone)
Do you have the Vice President?

EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

AGENT MARCUS GRAHAM (30's) on the other end, as he hustles
Jenna and VICE PRESIDENT ALVIN HAMMOND (60's) into a waiting
SUV. INTERCUT:

AGENT GRAHAM
We're putting him in the car now!

FINNERTY
You don't stop for red lights, for
police, and if something gets in
your way, you drive through it!

AGENT GRAHAM
Is the President dead?

Finnerty takes a breath.

FINNERTY
We do not have his 20!

Graham turns to the Driver.

AGENT GRAHAM
Go!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR

Bishop and his team race the President through the now mostly
empty Center Hall of the Residence.

BISHOP
(into radio)
Eagle is thirty seconds from the
Vault, we are coming in hot!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER
THE VAULT - the most secure room in the world.
A ridiculously hi-tech room two floors below the East Wing.

Chrome, glass, and LCD screens. The Watch Commander on the
hard-line to Bishop:
39.
WATCH COMMANDER
Sir, we cannot open the door without
authentication-
INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR - DAY
As they run --
BISHOP
We're under attack, goddammit, open
the door!
WATCH COMMANDER (0.S.)
(through radio)
You know the rules, we need voice
and retinal authentication from the
President!
Cale, coming down the stairs, seeing the President's Team...

CALE
Hey!

The MARINE turns, seeing a Cale hefting the machine gun. He
OPENS UP with his M-16!

Cale dives across the hall into the CHINA ROOM as four
generations of White House China is obliterated around him!

CALE (CONT'D)
Goddammit, I'm on your side!

But the President's already gone, down the East Colonnade...
EXT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING
Coming up on DC, smoke from the Capitol rising into the sky...

MARINE ONE PILOT
Holy shit...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BASEMENT LEVEL
Bishop and team hustle the President out of the back stairs...
BISHOP
They're right behind us, open the
Vault!

Around a corner, coming up on the HUGE VAULT DOOR...
40.

WATCH COMMANDER (0.S.)
We still need authentication-

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(grabs the radio)
Open the goddamn door, Commander!
INT. WHITE HOUSE - PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER

The Commander and his Lieutenant exchange a look. Definitely
the President. The men turn their keys together and...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - MORNING

We hear HUGE TUMBLERS moving. As they clunk into place, the
three foot thick steel door rumbles open revealing

The P.E.O.C. Bishop stares at it, as the others rush past
him inside. Hope looks at him, strangely.

AGENT HOPE
We need to seal the Vault!

BISHOP
I'm sorry, Ted.

And then Bishop raises his Sig-Sauer and shoots his friend
in the chest! Holy shit!

The other two Agents and the Marine raise their weapons, but
Bishop has the drop on them and takes them out too! Kills
the Watch Commander and his Lieutenant as well!

Swings his gun back around to the President when -- BULLETS
Rip into the wall just above Bishop's head!

CALE (0.S.)
Run, Mr. President!

Cale at the end of the hall, MP-5 blazing! Giving the
President cover fire! Sawyer books down the hall to him!
Cale grabs his wrist and drags him around a corner.

CALE (CONT'D)
Come on!

As they run:

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Who are you?
41.
CALE
Don't worry, I'm Secret Service,
you're safe--oh shit!

As Stenz emerges from the stairwell and OPENS FIRE! Cale
yanks Sawyer back the way they came!

CALE (CONT'D)
Elevator!

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?!

CALE
Where's an elevator?

The President pulls Cale into a nook where an ELEVATOR DOOR
sits. Stabbing the button relentlessly. Bishop coming down
one side of the hallway, Stenz the other. Boxed in...

The elevator OPENS and -- Cale and Sawyer leap in, stabbing
the door close button as Stenz sprints towards them, firing...
The doors slide shut.

STENZ
Shit!

BISHOP
It only goes up one floor!

Bishop and Stenz sprint back down the corridor to
INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BACK STAIRCASE - MORNING

Taking the stairs two at a time and we TRACK with them running
as they burst out into

INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST LOBBY - MORNING

Running flat out to the elevator doors, weapons up... They
stop. Doors don't open. Bishop puts his ear to the door.

BISHOP
They're going back down!

Still tracking with them as they haul ass back to the
INT. WHITE HOUSE - EAST WING - BASEMENT LEVEL - MORNING

Bishop and Stenz, booking back to the elevator...
42.

Too late. The elevator doors are open, the car empty. Cale
and the President are gone. Stenz punches the wall.

STENZ
Shit!

BISHOP

It doesn't matter.

(off his look)
He got us into the PEOC, that's what
counts. Button up the building and
send out patrols, we will find him.
As long as we fortify in the next
five minutes they won't be able to
get in here-

Cut off by the sound of a CHOPPER approaching...

STENZ
What's that?

BISHOP
Marine One.
(into radio)
Mulachy?

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Mulachy, drilling the last section of the base of a .50 CAL
CANNON into the roof. The rotor blades growing louder...

MULACHY
(into radio)
We're on it!
Mulachy grins and moves behind the trigger of the .50 Cal...
EXT. MARINE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING

Coming in low over Pennsylvania Avenue, only fifty feet above
the deck. We hear their radio chatter:

MARINE ONE PILOT (0.S.)
Castle, this is Marine One, we are
coming in for exfil on the South
Lawn, coming in now, over!

No response.

MARINE ONE PILOT (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Castle, I say again we-
43.

As .50 CAL TRACERS streak from the Mulachy's roof cannon,
tattooing the side of the Presidential Helicopter!

MARINE ONE PILOT (0.S.) (CONT'D)
Break left, break left!

The chopper screams high and to the left as BULLETS ZANG off
it's armored body!

MARINE ONE PILOT (CONT'D)
This is Marine One, we are taking
fire from Castle, repeat, we are
taking fire from Castle!
Smoke pours from the helicopter as it soars high above the
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING
In all it's glory below. Now occupied by new residents.
MARINE ONE PILOT (0.S.)
Castle has fallen, repeat, Castle
has fallen. The White House is down.

Finnerty sprints the last half-block to the ruined Capitol,
dodging fire trucks, still on the phone with Graham.

FINNERTY
Where are you?

INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S SUV (MOVING) - MORNING
Sirens screaming, the VICE PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE is flying
through Washington surface streets at 70 MPH! Graham has to
shout to be heard:
AGENT GRAHAM

We're two miles away from Andrews,

the Vice President is secure!
EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - MORNING

AGENT KELLERMAN (0.S.)
Carol!

Finnerty turns to see Kellerman loading Speaker Raphelson
into a limousine. Kellerman motions her over.

Finnerty goes and slides into the front seat of the car...
INT. VICE PRESIDENT'S SUV (MOVING) - MORNING

FINNERTY (0.S.)

INT. LEAD SUV (MOVING) - MORNING

The Driver grips the wheel of the lead car of the Motorcade.
Five blocks up - AN AMBULANCE is stopped across the
intersection. Lights flashing.

LEAD CAR DRIVER
They're emergency vehicles!

AGENT GRAHAM (0.S.)
(through radio)
Agent, if they do not move, you drive
through them!

Four blocks away now...

LEAD CAR DRIVER
But, sir-

AGENT GRAHAM (0.S.)
We may have already lost the
President, this could be another
attempt! You do not stop!

Three blocks away. The Driver swallows.

LEAD CAR DRIVER
Roger that.

Two blocks away. The Driver leans on the horn. He doesn't
decrease speed. The Ambulance stays where it is...

LEAD CAR DRIVER (CONT'D)
(whispering)
Move, please move, please...
45.

One block. He's not moving. The Driver grips the wheel and
closes his eyes. For God and country...

EXT. WASHINGTON STREETS - MORNING

WHAM! The Lead SUV strikes the Ambulance doing 70! Both
vehicles, ripped and twisted by the impact, flying off the
pavement sideways and smashing into a STOREFRONT!

Creating a HOLE in the intersection that the rest of the
Vice President's Motorcade ROARS through!

EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

The security gate opens as the Motorcade tears through and
out onto the TARMAC. Screeching to a halt next to

AIR FORCE ONE
Gleaming in the sun. All polished up and ready to go.

Secret Service leaps out of the cars, scanning for threats.
Weapon out, Graham hustles the Vice President up the gangway.

AGENT GRAHAM
Move, sir, move!

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MORNING

Graham, the Vice President Jenna and the rest scramble aboard
the aircraft as we hear the engines powering up. As they
buckle in, over the INTERCOM:

CAPTAIN DIX (0.S.)
Mr. Vice President, my name is Captain
Leo Dix and I apologize in advance,
but this is gonna be the hardest
take-off you've ever felt. We're
going to put this bird at 30,000
feet in 15 seconds, so do not be
alarmed if you lose consciousness -
Mikey, hit it.

And the plane shoots forward at FULL THROTTLE!

The passengers pinned back in their seats as the engines
roar and Air Force One takes flight...

EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

Air Force One climbs up and away at a 55 DEGREE ANGLE from
the ground, becoming a speck in seconds...
46.
INT. RAPHELSON'S MOTORCADE (MOVING) - MORNING

Roaring through the streets of DC. CNN plays on a small TV.
We see a horrible sight - the CAPITOL DOME COLLAPSES INWARDS
on itself from the heat inside. Flames rise from it.

CNN NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
Oh, My God... Oh, my God, I don't
have the words...

Raphelson swallows. Finnerty pulls a pistol from her hip.
Checks the load, offers it to Raphelson.

FINNERTY
You know how to use one of these?
(off his look)
We don't know where they might hit
next and this country needs need you
alive, sir. Take it.

Raphelson does. The limo takes a hard right, heading for...
EXT. PENTAGON - MORNING

Establishing. Dozens of MARINES in full body armor with
assault rifles guard the gates. MILITARY TANKS rolling onto
the lawn to establish a hard perimeter.

Raphelson's Motorcade roars through the gates into an
INT. PENTAGON - UNDERGROUND GARAGE - MORNING

The cars pull to a halt and Raphelson, Finnerty, Kellerman,
and the rest spring out, heading for the front doors.

RAPHELSON
We need the Head of the FAA to ground
all air traffic over the Continental
US and we need to close the borders--
Where's the director of Homeland
Security?

SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
He was at the White House.

RAPHELSON
Who's the Assistant Director?

SPEAKER'S ASSISTANT
Wyck Halsey. Also at the White House.
47.

RAPHELSON
Jesus.

FINNERTY
I'm on with Agent Graham!

RAPHELSON
How are they doing?

FINNERTY
(listens; then)
The VP just puked on Air Force One.

As the Two Marines in front of them open the doors wide...

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Mr. Speaker, welcome to the Pentagon.
I'm Colonel Janowitz, I'll be taking
you down to the bunker. Are these
people with you?

RAPHELSON
Yes, Colonel.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Follow me.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR

Emily peeks around a corner to see a GROUP OF HOSTAGES herded
into the Center Hall. Some weeping and crying. HUMPHRIES
and several Mercenaries standing guard. She backs away when

A HAND grabs her by the hair! STENZ. He drags her kicking
and screaming out from her hiding place!

EMILY
Get off me, asshole!

BISHOP (0.S.)
That's not necessary.

Bishop steps out from the East Wing. Stenz deposits Emily
with the others, glaring at her. Bishop addresses them.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize,
but this will not take long. If you
bear with us and do what we say, you
will not be harmed.

(MORE )
48.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
(to Humphries)
Get a count, bring it to me. Search
all of them then move them to the
Situation Room. Any of my agents
separate out, I don't want them
causing dissent.

HUMPHRIES
You want me to...

BISHOP
I want you to tie them up and lock
them in a closet and that's all.
When you're done I want patrols
organized, we need to do a room to
room search of the complex.

HUMPHRIES
Why, are we missing something?

Stenz gives him a look - not the time. Humphries nods and
his men begin the count.

STENZ
Where do you want to set up command?

BISHOP
Where do you think?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING

Small fires are being extinguished by mercenaries. Bishop
and Stenz stride through until they reach

THE OVAL OFFICE
Bishop steps inside. A moment. Takes it all in.

BISHOP
This'll do. Where's Tyler?

STENZ
Still getting set up.

Bishop grabs a radio. Into it:

BISHOP
Mr. Tyler, we have a time frame yet?
49,
INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING

TYLER, the man in glasses from the truck, supervises several
Mercenaries as they unpack huge crates of computer equipment
and jack them in to the mainframe in the PEOC.

TYLER
(into radio)
We're still plugging in power-bars
down here, it's gonna be a little
bit.

BISHOP (0.S.)
(through radio)
Call me when you have a timeline.

Tyler puts down the radio and takes a seat at the central
computer surveys the room. He smiles, deposits a JAR OF
LOLLIPOPS next to the keyboard, and begins typing...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Colonel Janowitz swipes his keycard and leads Raphelson and
the others into the PENTAGON BUNKER, a bustling hi-tech
Emergency Command Center.

RAPHELSON
What do we know?

COLONEL JANOWITZ
At 9:17 a.m. an explosive device was
detonated in the Capitol. We now
believe this to have been a diversion,
allowing a paramilitary team to seize
control of the White House. They
hold an unknown number of hostages,
who may or may not include the
President of the United States. We
do not know their numbers, their
capabilities, or their intentions.

RAPHELSON
So we know nothing.

FINNERTY
We know we're down one Capitol and
one White House.

Raphelson shoots her a look. A LIEUTENANT looks up.
50.

LIEUENENANT GAINES
Sir, I have the Vice President from
Air Force One.

RAPHELSON
Alvin, are you okay?

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONFERENCE ROOM (FLYING) - MORNING

VICE PRESIDENT ALVIN HAMMOND (60's, grey) stands with his
chief aide WALLACE (30's, oily) and several others. INTERCUT:

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
I'm fine, we're just a little shaken
up. Do we know what happened yet?

RAPHELSON
We're just getting briefed now.
(to Colonel Janowitz)
Who's in command on the ground?

COLONEL JANOWITZ

Permission to speak freely?

(off his nod)
It's a shitshow. DC police is on
scene, but FBI is trying to run it,
plus Secret Service feels it should
be their show since it was their
building that got took.

FINNERTY
It was.
(into speaker)
Carol Finnerty, Secret Service, sir.
We need one single command structure
here.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
What we need is to send in the Army
to retake the White House.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
You can't do that, sir.
(off their looks)
Posse Comitatus makes it illegal to
deploy American troops on American
soil.

RAPHELSON
What about federalizing the National
Guard?
51.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Goes against a 200 year old law known
as the Insurrection Act, plus the
Vice President can't order it.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Why not?

RAPHELSON
(getting it)
Because he's the Vice President.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
You do not hold the power of the
Presidency, that is correct, sir.
Make no mistake, we are ina
Constitutional crisis - we have never
lost a Chief Executive before. If
the President were dead, that would
be one thing, but missing? There's
no constitutional remedy for that.

Hammond's young aide WALLACE speaks up.

WALLACE
Yes, there is. We need to talk about
invoking the 25th Amendment.

FINNERTY
You want to remove the President
from power?

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
I don't want to do anything-

COLONEL JANOWITZ

(shaking his head)
There are some practical issues with
that, sir - The 25th would require a
majority of the Cabinet to vote that
President Sawyer was unfit to hold
office in absentia - something that
a). They may not do, and b). May
not be possible, considering we do
not have eyes on the Secretaries of
State, Energy, Transportation,
Education, and Homeland Security.

RAPHELSON
You're saying a third of the
President's cabinet may be dead?
52.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
That's exactly what I'm saying, sir.

WALLACE
We should get a head count of who's
left.

RAPHELSON
Sir-

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
We can't be hamstrung by legalities,
Eli. Delta Force is out of North
Carolina, correct?

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Fayetteville, yes, sir.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
How long would it take to get them
to DC?

COLONEL JANOWITZ
We can have them on the ground here
in forty minutes.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Then do it. We're going to take
back what's ours.

Wallace nods to him, happy with this play.

RAPHELSON
There's another consideration...

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Which is?

RAPHELSON
We don't know what they want yet.

WALLACE
You want to negotiate with them?

RAPHELSON
I want to find out what they're after
before we send a trident missile
through the front door-

FINNERTY
We've called them, right?
They turn to look at her.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Who?

FINNERTY
Whoever did this. We've tried them
on the phone by now, haven't we?

53.

Janowitz's look says it all. Finnerty goes and snatches up

the nearest phone.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
What are you doing?

FINNERTY
Calling the White House.

INT. WEST WING - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - MORNING

The hostages are led down the stairs, through a low lit
carpeted hallway to the SITUATION ROOM. Emily walks next to

Donnie the Tour Guide, who is entranced.

DONNIE
Wow...
EMILY
What?
DONNIE
They never let us in here on the
tour.

Emily stares at him. He's having a ball...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop sits behind the President's desk. Stenz

STENZ
Hostage count is seventy-one.
Humphries has them secure in the
SitRoom.

Bishop nods as he picks up his radio.

BISHOP
Good.
(into radio)
Tyler, where are you?

comes over.
54.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING

Tyler chewing on a lollipop, hands flying over his keyboard.
One of the others holds the radio to his mouth as he speaks:

TYLER
It's getting a little gnarly down
here... Without the President's

Passcode, we're looking at about 45
more minutes.

BISHOP (0.S.)
(through radio)
45 minutes I can handle, call me
when you're close.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop puts the radio back down.
STENZ
Switchboard says they have an incoming

call. One of yours.

BISHOP
It's about time.

He looks down at the phone. Line one lit up. He answers.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Hello?

INTERCUT:

FINNERTY
This Agent Carol Finnerty, to whom
am I speaking?

BISHOP
It's me, Carol.

FINNERTY
Martin! Are you okay?

BISHOP
I'm fine. You should have called
already, we've had the building for
fifteen minutes.

A beat.
55.

FINNERTY
We?

BISHOP
I'm assuming you're recording this,
so I'll make it easy for you - my
name is Martin James Bishop and my
men currently control the White House
and 71 hostages within. The following
political prisoners are to be released -
Gerry Burke, Gregory Aoki, Sadaam Al-
Hafra, Vikram Govindan, Michael Mayer-

FINNERTY
Will, what are you-

BISHOP
-I'm not going through these names
again, Carol - Efrem Krieger, Arneau
Galezowski, and Saadi Soudavar. You
have one hour to effect these releases
or we begin killing hostages, it's
that simple.

Finnerty takes a breath.

FINNERTY
Why are you doing this?

BISHOP
Not your concern. Clock's ticking.

About to hang up the phone when:

FINNERTY
Is the President alive?

BISHOP
Yes.

FINNERTY

I want proof of life.
Stenz raises an eyebrow at Bishop.
BISHOP
One hour, or I execute him in front
of cameras on the South Lawn.

He hangs up the phone.
56.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Raphelson and the others stare at Finnerty lowers the phone,
reeling. Takes a breath. Centers herself and

FINNERTY
We need all of Bishop's financial
and medical records immediately,
he's got a wife Muriel and three
kids in Georgetown, I want them
brought here now.

Agent Kellerman nods and goes.

RAPHELSON
You okay?

FINNERTY
I have Thanksgiving at their house
every year.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop looks up at Stenz.

BISHOP
Find the President.

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - THIRD FLOOR - MORNING

The First Family's personal quarters. Far away from the
chaos going on two floors below.

Cale steps into the room, gun up. Scanning. Tasteful
decorations. Thick carpet, plush furniture. And empty.

CALE
We're clear.

President Sawyer enters behind him.

CALE (CONT'D)
Right now they're getting situated,
but that won't last. They'll be
coming for us.

(checks his clip)
Shit.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?
57.

CALE
We only have three bullets. Do you
keep any weapons in here?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
There are usually two dress marines
with M-16's standing outside that
door, so no, I didn't see the need.

CALE
What about knives in the kitchen?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Through there.

The President points to a door. Cale raises the gun.

CALE
Stay behind me.

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Pristine. Pot racks and expensive ranges. Warming drawers.
A beautiful kitchen. Cale enters. No one there.

CALE
Clear.

Sawyer comes in behind him and goes for the knife block on
the island.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
How long have you been in the Secret
Service?

CALE
Six months.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Are you kidding me?

CALE
Well, technically six months Tuesday.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
But you've done this before?

CALE
Oh, sure, this is like my third White
House terrorist take-over attack
this month.
58.
Cale spies the phone on the wall. Goes to pick it up...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What are you doing?

CALE
Not that I don't like our chances
with three bullets and a kitchen
knife, but I thought you might want
to call your good friends at Seal
Team Six and see if they wanted to
swing by and help.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You pick up that line, anyone at the
switchboard will know we're up here.

CALE
Good point. Do you have a cell phone?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I have a better idea.

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The President opens up his bedside drawer and withdraws a
sleek SATELLITE PHONE.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Satphone with a built in alpha-
scrambler. No one can tap in.

CALE
Why do you have this next to your
bed?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
So I can make private calls to the
man I'm seeing.

Cale blinks.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
Kidding. Sheryl wanted to be able
to call her mother without the NSA
listening in. So, who do we call?

CALE
You don't know?
59.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I haven't placed a phone call for
myself in over two years.

CALE
They didn't give you like a special
Presidential dial-in number in case
of emergencies?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(dry ) .
No, they told me my Secret Service
protection would handle that.

Touche. Cale stares at the phone. Has an idea. Fishes out
a card from his pocket...

CALE
I know who we're calling.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING

Cruising altitude. Shaken, Jenna sits in her seat watching
the VICE PRESIDENT and others walks down the aisle to the
CONFERENCE ROOM down the hall.

Jenna raises a soda to her mouth with a shaky hand... Her
cell phone rings. She jumps, spilling the soda. Answers.

JENNA
Hello?

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Cale with the satphone. INTERCUT:

CALE
Jenna, it's John Cale, I'm with the
Pres-

JENNA

This really isn't a good time.
And she HANGS UP. Cale stares at the phone in disbelief.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Close friend?

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING

Jenna, about to take another sip when the phone RINGS AGAIN.
She spills again. Answers, about to yell at him but:
60.

CALE
Jenna, don't hang up! I'm calling
from inside the White House, I have
the President with me!

JENNA
That's not funny, John.

CALE
Jenna, I'm not kid-

Sawyer takes the phone from Cale.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Jenna, hi, this is James Sawyer,
listen, I've just spent the last ten
minutes getting shot at, so if you
could connect me to whatever command
and control structure we have left
in this country, I would really
appreciate it.

JENNA
(flustered)
Sir! Yes, sir, I- uh, hold on!
She bolts from her seat...
INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM
A beat. The President looks to Cale.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
We're on hold.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - CONFERENCE ROOM (FLYING) - MORNING

The Vice President, getting a quiet pep-talk from his Chief
of Staff.

WALLACE
This is your moment, sir. The country
is looking for a leader. It's your
time to step up-

Interrupted as Jenna bursts in, out of breath!

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
I told you we weren't to be disturbed-
61.

JENNA
(holds up her phone)
The President of the United States

just called my cell.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop's radio crackles. It's EVERETT, the head of one of

the sweep teams:
EVERETT (0.S.)
We just finished a sweep of the State

Floor, no sign of them.
Bishop thinks. Into the radio:
BISHOP
If someone broke into your house,
where would you run and hide?
(realizes)
They're in the Residence. Go.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Raphelson and Finnerty gather around the viewscreen as Jenna
puts the call through.
VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND

Hello? Mr. President?

INTERCUT:
PRESIDENT SAWYER

I'm here, Alvin. We're okay.
VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND

We?
PRESIDENT SAWYER

I'm with a Secret Service Agent, I'm

going to put him on the line.

Handing the phone over to

CALE
Hello, this is Agent John Cale.

FINNERTY

Cale?
CALE
Miss Finnerty?
62.

RAPHELSON
John, what are you doing in there?

CALE
Long story, sir. They've taken the
building and are holding hostages.
We evaded them so far, but that won't
last, so not to put too fine a point
on it, but this is the part where
you come in here and save us.

FINNERTY
We're working on several different
scenarios, but in the meantime, you
need to get the President out. Can
you get to the basement?

Cale looks to Sawyer, who nods.

CALE
Yes.

FINNERTY
Good. There's a series of tunnels
that lead out to the street. JFK
used them to sneak Marilyn in.

CALE
I thought those were a myth.

FINNERTY
Actually, they're not.

CALE
Donnie's gonna be pissed...

FINNERTY
You get to the basement, and I'll
lead you to the tunnels.

CALE
And when I get him out, you're gonna
come in and get the hostages, right?
Finnerty and Raphelson exchange a look.
CALE (CONT'D)
They have my daughter. Tell me you
have a plan to save her.

Finnerty takes a breath.
63.

FINNERTY
We will get to her, but you have to
get the President to safety. This
is the most important thing you will
ever do.

CALE
You want me to leave my child?

FINNERTY
I want you to do your sworn duty and
protect the President of the United
States!

DING! The Elevator ARRIVING on the Third Floor! Sawyer's
eyes go wide as he motions to the hallway - they're coming.

Cale hangs up on her.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER

FINNERTY
Cale? Cale!

She's just met with static.
INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The door creaks open and CHEN and EVERETT creep into the
room, rifles up. They scan the room - seemingly empty.

EVERETT
Mr. President?

No response.

EVERETT (CONT'D)
We have no desire to harm you or
your companion. Please come quietly.

Chen points to the bed - Cale's blood spattered SHOE poking
out from the far side. He gives Everett a hand signal, you
go right, I go left.

EVERETT (CONT'D)
The sooner you come with us, the
sooner this will be over.
He springs around the bed weapon up to find...

Just the shoe sitting there. Everett blinks. A decoy. And
then the wardrobe door flies open behind him and
64.

CALE leaps out, knife in hand, stabbing him in the back!
Everett screams and pulls the trigger and the room is filled
with GUNFIRE! Chen goes down, riddled with bullets!

Everett charges backwards, trying to throw Cale off! Smashing
him back through the door, charging across the West Sitting
Hall and into

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Everett slams Cale back against the island and rips the knife
out of his back, spinning to face him!

Cale grabs a pan and hurls it at Everett's head, who ducks
and slashes, catching Cale across the forearm!

EVERETT
Ranger choke-hold? You one of those
Army pussies?

He slashes again as Cale hurls a pot at him!

EVERETT (CONT'D)
We used to use faggots like you for
target practice!

Cale jumps up and brings the whole fucking pot rack down on
Everett's head! Everett reeling, Cale grabs a cutting board
and whacks Everett across the face!

Everett drops the knife and they grapple, but Everett's
getting the upper hand...

PRESIDENT SAWYER (0.S.)
Freeze!

They both look - in the doorway, the President of the United
States, holding the gun on them.

Everett doesn't freeze. In fact, he smiles and continues to
beat the ever loving shit out of Cale. Sawyer, trying to
get a clear line of sight...

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
What- what do you want me to do?

CALE
Shoot him!

Sawyer's finger tightens on the trigger, but Everett gets
his arm around Cale's neck and hauls him in front of him,
using him like a human shield...
65.

CALE (CONT'D)
Wait not, now! Don't shoot now!

Sawyer moving the gun around, trying to get a clear shot...
Cale rams his head back into Everett's nose - SNAP! Everett
screams and Cale dives clear.

CALE (CONT'D)
Now!

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Sawyer shoots and Everett is blown backwards
off his feet! He lands in a heap, dead.

Cale collapses against the counter, gasping. Sawyer lowers
the gun. Breathing hard. Numb. They both sink to the floor.

Water sprays up form the sink, where a bullet struck it.
Silence.

CALE (CONT'D)
Three bullets...?

Sawyer looks over at him.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?

CALE
You had to use all three bullets?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I saved your life and you're giving
me notes?

Cale pulls himself to his feet.

CALE
We have to conserve ammo...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I was trying to conserve people.
You're welcome, by the way.

Cale kneels down next to Everett's body, dialing the satphone.
CALE

(into satphone)
We have two dead bad guys up here.
66.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Raphelson and the others look up as Cale's voice comes through
the speaker. Finnerty rushes to grab the phone.

FINNERTY
Describe them.

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Cale rolls Everett's body over, searching him.

CALE
Both Americans, well trained,
proficient with small arms, hand to
hand combat and... oh, shit.

He's rolled up Everett's sleeve to expose a tattoo of a
Screaming Eagle.

FINNERTY (0.S.)
Cale?

But Cale HANGS UP the phone, severing the connection. Looks
at the President, quietly. Concerned.

CALE
Sir, this is a Special Forces tattoo.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
The army's doing this?

CALE
Maybe. They were taking orders from
your Head of Secret Service, right?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
It's a coup de'tat...

Cale games it out in his head...
CALE
No. If they wanted you dead, you'd
be dead. This is something else.
Sawyer nods. Looking at him.
PRESIDENT SAWYER

I didn't know they had your daughter.
(MORE )
67.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
(pause)
If I thought turning myself over to
them would save her, I'd do it. But
we both know that's not how these
people work.

Cale stops, noticing BLOOD on Sawyer's shirt. Alarmed, he
leans down and begins patting him down.

CALE
Are you hit?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?

CALE
(searching for a wound)
Have you been shot, sir?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(pushes him away)
No! No, it's the other guy's blood
from the bedroom- I got splattered.

Cale steps back, relieved. Looks at Sawyer. The President
of the United States, in his care.

CALE
I'm going to get you out of here.

He extends a hand to Sawyer and pulls him to his feet. Grabs
Everett's MP-5 and checks the load.

CALE (CONT'D)
We have to get to the basement.

They head for the West Sitting Hall...
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Finnerty, talking to the Communications Officer.

FINNERTY
Get him back on the line!

Agent Kellerman re-enters the Bunker and pulls her aside.

AGENT KELLERMAN
Muriel Bishop left the country four
days ago, bought a one way ticket to
Venezuela. Non-extradition.
68.

FINNERTY
Pull phone records, see if the
Venezuelan government was in contact
with either of them in the last two
years. Loop in NSA, they might have
had a tap on Bishop's phone.

AGENT KELLERMAN
There's something else.

He hands her a sheet of paper. Finnerty scans it, then takes
a deep breath. Turns to address the room and the viewscreens.

FINNERTY
Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, we
have a problem.

RAPHELSON
Another one?

FINNERTY
The list of prisoners Bishop wants
released; they're not all in the US.
Gerry Burke is former Sein Fein and
is being held in London, Galezowski
is a Basque separatist, he's in France-

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Well, I'm sure all these countries
would cooperate if-

FINNERTY
Samir Al-Hafra's being held in Iran.
State Department's already reached
out, but they won't let him go.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
What did Al-Hafra do?

FINNERTY
Tried to assassinate their President.

RAPHELSON
There's a lot of that going around.

FINNERTY
It doesn't make sense. Why these
prisoners? What do they have in
common? A Basque separatist, an
Irish revolutionary--what's Krieger?
69.

AGENT KELLERMAN
Former MOSAAD.

FINNERTY
None of these guys are high value
targets, we've got bigger names
sitting in Guantanamo right now.

RAPHELSON
You think it's a diversion.

FINNERTY
I think it's something.

RAPHELSON
Tell State to try again. Linked or
not, we either need to release these
people or kick in the door in the
next 43 minutes, otherwise Bishop's
going to start executing hostages on
national TV.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
If the Iranians won't give up Al-
Hafra, maybe we go get him.

They look to the VP's viewscreen.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND (CONT'D)
The Nimitz is in the Gulf, they have
a detachment of SEALS onboard.

RAPHELSON
If we send men into Iran to get Al-
Hafra, we're committing an act of
war. Do you really want that on our
plate this morning too?

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
You don't think we're at war? Take
a look around you. Come on Eli,
Iran's our enemy, you said it yourself-

RAPHELSON
Just because I don't want to sign a
treaty with them doesn't mean I think
it's a good idea to invade! We need
to hold this together.
70.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Colonel, I want the SEALS briefed
and prepped for an assault on the
prison if we give the word.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Respectfully, sir, only the President
can give that order-

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
The President is behind enemy lines
and compromised. I'm assembling the
cabinet now to invoke the 25th.

Raphelson stares at him, in shock.

RAPHELSON
The President's still alive... You
won't get the votes...

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Wallace assures me I will. We've
already done the head count.
(to Colonel Janowitz)
It'll take about ten more minutes to
get everyone together. How long
till Delta Force arrives?

COLONEL JANOWITZ
They'll be here in fifteen minutes.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
By the time they land, I'll be able
to give them the go order.
(to Raphelson)
Get onboard, Eli.

He cuts the connection. Raphelson looks to Finnerty. Not
good...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING
Tyler's radio crackles:

BISHOP (0.S.)
How's it coming, Mr. Tyler?

Tyler, fingers flying on the keyboard. He curses, spits out
his lollipop and grabs the walkie. INTERCUT:

TYLER
I'm having a firewall problem...
71.

BISHOP
Meaning?

TYLER
You know what happens when they catch
you trying to hack the government?
They hire you. I'm working against
the best black-hats of the last twenty
years-

BISHOP
I'm going to need you to come to the
point here.

TYLER
I'm going to need more time, another
two hours at least-

BISHOP
Shit.

Tyler takes a deep breath.

TYLER
It would be a lot easier if you
brought me that passcode.

BISHOP
So noted. Everett, did you find
anything in the residence? Everett?

No response. Bishop frowns. Tyler, seeing something on his
monitor. One of the elevators is MOVING.

TYLER
I have movement. Central elevator,
coming down from the residence-

BISHOP
It's them. Can you stop it between
floors?
TYLER
(typing)
Absolutely. Halted between two and
three.
BISHOP

Lock it up, then send a team to--
actually scratch that. Stenz, would
you be so kind as to bring me the
President of the United States?
72.
Stenz hefts his M4 rifle with a grin and heads for the door...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR - CENTER HALL - MORNING
Stenz leads a team of three men towards the elevator bank.
STENZ
(into radio)
We're in the central lobby. Bring
it down.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING

Tyler punches in a few more keystrokes and onscreen the
elevator begins moving again...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR - CENTER HALL - MORNING
Stenz hears the machinery moving and the elevator car comes
to a halt on their floor. Weapons up, ready to for a
firefight. The doors ding and slide open to reveal...

The car is empty. Stenz keys his radio:

STENZ
It's a decoy! They're still upstairs!

He books for the stairwell, his team following. As they
bound upstairs...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTRAL ELEVATOR SHAFT - MORNING
Grimy and disgusting. Everything covered with grease. Cale
and Sawyer are shimmying down a narrow service ladder to the
base of the shaft.
CALE
I'm surprised nobody put this on the
tour.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I'll look into it.

They reach the recessed bottom of the shaft. Standing among
the elevator machinery, the bottom floor of the White House
at their chin level. Cale dials Finnerty...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Finnerty snatches up the phone. INTERCUT:
73.

FINNERTY
Are you okay?

CALE
Relatively. We're at the base of
the elevator shaft.

FINNERTY
You mean in the elevator?

CALE
Not so much, no.

Finnerty checks the blueprints.

FINNERTY
Okay. Okay, you need to pry the
doors open and get across the hall
to the stairwell - that'll lead you
down to the catacombs.

CALE
How are we going to open the door?

The President holds up a butcher knife from upstairs. Cale
smiles and takes it. Pries open the elevator doors a crack.

He STOPS. Footsteps on the hall. Someone rushing past
pushing a dolly loaded with wooden crates. The stamp on the
side says "SURFACE TO AIR"...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
That can't be good.

Cale waits for the sound to recede, then slides open the
doors the rest of the way. Climbing out into the

INT. WHITE HOUSE BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - MORNING

A low lit hall, filled with boxes. This is the Storage Level.
Cale, covered in grease. He pulls the similarly filthy
President up and they move across the hallway to the stairs...

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - THIRD FLOOR - MORNING

Stenz and his team sprint into the Main Room. Nothing.
They find Chen dead in the bedroom and Everett down in the
kitchen. Stenz looks back to the elevator. Realizing:

STENZ
Goddammit, they're in the shaft!
(MORE )
74.

STENZ (CONT'D)
(runs for the door)
Whoever this guy is, he's starting
to piss me off...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - STORAGE STAIRWELL - MORNING
Cale and the President descend a spiral staircase.

CALE
Did you know about this?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I just knew about the tunnel from
the pool house that leads back to
the Residence. Truman put it in
because he didn't want to be
photographed in his swim trunks
walking back to the house.

They reach a door at the bottom of the stairs.

CALE
(into satphone)
We're at the bottom of the stairs.

FINNERTY (0.S.)
That's the entrance to the catacombs.
Take the second tunnel on your right,
follow it all the way out. We'll be
waiting.

Cale takes the pistol out and hands it to the President.

CALE
I'm not going with you.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What?

CALE
I can't leave her. You get out, you
send the Marines back in to get me
and my daughter.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You have my word.

They shake. The President pushes through the door...
75.
INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING
Dingy, clearly built during the bomb-shelter era. The
President steps forward to a chickenwire gate that leads to
the tunnels. About to open when he notices --

PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES wired to the gate door. Beeping
transmitters and wires everywhere. He stares at it.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Cale!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Finnerty snatches up the ringing phone.

FINNERTY
You on your way?

INTERCUT with Cale and the President staring at the bomb:
CALE
The entrance to the tunnel has been

wired with explosives.

FINNERTY
What's it look like?

CALE
Like a shit-ton of explosives. Here.

He snaps a photo of it with the satphone and sends it. An
image of the device pops up on Finnerty's viewscreen.

FINNERTY
Oh, yeah, don't touch that.
(to Colonel Janowitz)

I need an explosives expert in here

now!
INT. WHITE HOUSE - MAIN STAIRWELL - MORNING
Stenz and his team, racing back down the stairs...
INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING

Cale and the President hear the footsteps approaching.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
They're coming...
76.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Finnerty, desperately flipping through White House blueprints.
INTERCUT:

CALE

We have to move, where are we going?
FINNERTY

Hold on-
CALE

I can't hold on, which way!

FINNERTY
I don't know, I- Just run!

Cale and the President BOLT back into the stairwell...
INT. WHITE HOUSE BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - MORNING
They burst out of the stairwell into the low-lit corridor...
FINNERTY
Central staircase should be fifty
yards in front of you. Delta's
inbound, ten minutes!
CALE
They'll have us by then! We need a
location!

The President grabs his arm. Says one word.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Stagecoach.

CALE
(into radio)
I know where we're going, Finnerty.
We're getting out of here.

They reach the central staircase, as behind them, the elevator
DINGS open...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
Raphelson leans over to her.

RAPHELSON
The cabinet's assembling right now...
77.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - MAIN STAIRWELL - MORNING
As they sprint up the stairs:

FINNERTY (0.S.)
(through satphone)

Cale, if you don't get him out of

there in the next five minutes, he

may not be the President anymore.

CALE
We're doing the best we can, but
thanks for the added pressure!

Sawyer pulls him to the left as a BURST OF GUNFIRE comes
from below! Stenz, coming for them. Cale and the President
bolt off the stairs onto the STATE FLOOR Stenz keys his radio:
STENZ
Contact in the Main Stairwell, they're
on the State Floor headed East!
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
BISHOP
East? Why would they-
(realizing)
Roland, they're coming to you!
INT. WHITE HOUSE - STATE FLOOR CORRIDOR
Bishop's man ROLAND, guarding a door.
ROLAND
(into radio)
Roger that, I'll be-

Bullets punch through him! Cale and the President! They
leap over his body and shoulder through the door into

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MOTOR POOL - MORNING

The PRESIDENT'S FULL MOTORCADE parked under the building.
Row upon row of black Yukons and Escalades. Cale and the
President bolt the door shut!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop, hearing Roland go down.
78.

BISHOP
Shit! All sweep teams, converge on
the Motor Pool!

He grabs his own weapon and races out the door...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - MOTOR POOL - MORNING

Bullets rip through the Motor Pool door - Stenz on the other
side, trying to get through!

CALE
Where are the keys?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
In the cage!

Sawyer begins tossing furniture in front of the door as Cale
races for the metal cage on the far side of the garage. He
finds a padlock on it and shoots it off! Rushing inside.

Dozens of keychains hang from hooks. Cale, about to ask the
President which one he should grab when he sees it --

A keychain with the Presidential Seal on it and these words -
Ground Force One. Cale smiles and snatches it up.

CALE
Got them!

The President abandons the door and they both run to the far
side of the garage where in all its glory sits

STAGECOACH - AKA "THE BEAST"

The Presidential Limousine. An eight ton military armored
modified Cadillac CTS, sitting on a Chevy Topkick wheelbase.
Each door weighs as much as a cabin door on a 747.

A hermetic HISS and CA-CHUNK as the doors UNLOCK. Cale gets
in the driver's side and the President runs for the rear.

CALE (CONT'D)
What the hell are you getting in the
back for?!

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Sorry, force of habit!

He slides into the passenger seat, and they closed the car
doors as the Motor Pool door crashes inwards!
79.

Stenz, running at them, EMPTYING a FULL CLIP into the five-
inch thick BALLISTIC GLASS in front of Cale's face! The
bullets just zang off! Cale points to his ear making the
universal "I can't hear you" gesture.

As Stenz reloads, Cale slams the keys into the ignition and
the Beast roars to life...

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
How do we open the garage door-

Cale hits the gas. The Beast peels out, SMASHING THROUGH
the closed Motor Pool doors out onto the East Entrance drive!

Bishop sprints into the Motor Pool just in time to see them
peel out!

BISHOP
We're going after them!

They grab keys and climb into the Yukon XL's to give chase...
EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - EAST DRIVE - MORNING
The Beast screeches around a corner, roaring up the East
Drive for the South Gate as the Yukons peel out of the garage!
Sawyer, seeing them coming.
PRESIDENT SAWYER
Shit, they're in the heavy-weapon
follow cars!

CALE
What do you mean 'heavy weapon'?

On cue, the Lead Yukon's sunroof retracts and manned .30
caliber M-134D DILLAN ROTATING MINI-GUN rises up out of the
car! (Seriously, these cars really exist).

The Gunner pulls the trigger and the cannon springs to life,
bullets tearing chunks out of pavement around the Beast!

CALE (CONT'D)
Are you kidding me?!

Cale yanks the wheel to the left, taking the chase off-road,
and ONTO THE SOUTH LAWN!

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

The Vice President sits, addressing the assembled members of
the CABINET on viewscreen.
80.
VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Ladies and Gentlemen of the cabinet,
thank you for joining me today. It
with a heavy heart that-
Wallace enters, interrupting him.

WALLACE
Sir, you need to see this...

He grabs a remote, clicking the TV on to CNN --

LIVE FEED of The Beast tearing across the South Lawn of the
White House, being pursued by three Black SUVs follow cars
each with roof mounted machine gun cannons...

INT. THE BEAST (MOVING) - MORNING

Cale tears through the Kennedy Garden, swerving...

CALE
Can we crash the fence?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
It's dual hardened steel and twelve
feet high, so no!

Until they have an exit, they're trapped on the White House
Grounds...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Raphelson and the others, watching the whole thing on TV
slack-jawed.

FINNERTY
We'll get a welding crew out there-

INT. THE BEAST (MOVING) - MORNING

PRESIDENT SAWYER
There's no time for that!

Cale swerves to dodge another hail of bullets and SMASHES
through the President's daughter's SWINGSET!

CALE
Get someone to blow a hole in it!
81.
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - MORNING
Three blocks up from the White House. TWO DC PATROLMEN sit
in their huge ARMORED RIOT-CONTROL VEHICLE on crowd control.
Watching with the rest of the world.

PATROLMAN
They're trapped in there...

His partner looks at him. They know what they have to do.
PATROLMAN (CONT'D)
Let's put some of this goddamn
Homeland Security budget to use!

He fires up the siren and the Riot Vehicle lurches forward,
tearing across the sidewalk towards the White House...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NORTH GATE - MORNING
The roar of an engine. The Guard looks up, then raises his
M4 to fire, but the Riot-Control Vehicle SMASHES THROUGH the
Gate and Guard House, FLATTENING HIM!
The cops whoop, victorious!
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - MORNING
Fist-sized CHUNKS OF CONCRETE are blown out of the White
House Fountain, as the Beast roars past it, being pounded by
the MINI-GUNS!
INT. THE BEAST (MOVING) - MORNING
FINNERTY (0.S.)
(through the radio)
There's a breach at the North Gate!
Go!

Cale yanks the wheel right, the car catching air as it
decimates the White House PUTTING GREEN...

INT. LEAD SUV (MOVING) - MORNING

BISHOP
Stay with him!

INT. THE BEAST (MOVING) - MORNING

Cale, trying to shake Bishop and figure out a way to the
North Side of the grounds.
82.
CALE
What's the quickest way to the North
Gate?

The President points. Dead ahead, the White House TENNIS
COURT. Cale hits the gas...

They chunk down onto the clay surface of the Tennis Court,
tearing across it, snapping through the net at center court.

Up a grass embankment on the other side, catching air,
slamming back down in time to smash through several sets of
PICNIC TABLES! Cale swerves left around a grove of trees,
the SUVs following, MINI-GUNS obliterating the foliage!

Up a hill, catching air again, then screeching onto the
President's BASKETBALL COURT, barely missing the basket,
which the Second SUV slams into, flipping over...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Mulachy, sighting the destruction at the North Entrance
through his scope...

MULACHY
(into radio)
They're going to make it to the Gate.
INT. LEAD SUV (MOVING) - MORNING

BISHOP
Use the ATR.

INT. ARMORED RIOT VEHICLE - MORNING
The Patrolmen seeing the Beast coming towards them:

PATROLMAN
Come on, you can make it! Come on-

WHOOMP! An ANTI-TANK ROUND goes through the windshield,
obliterating the Patrolmen, BLOWING THE VEHICLE APART!

INT. THE BEAST (MOVING) - MORNING

CALE
Jesus!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Mulachy retrains the huge gun on The Beast and PULLS THE
TRIGGER...
83.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - MORNING
Cale swerves in time and the First Lady's vegetable garden
is blown to smithereens! Cale zigs again as another anti-
tank round UPROOTS A TREE! Total destruction!
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING
Mulcahy sights them one last time...
EXT. WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS - MORNING
The anti-tank round SLAMS into the Beast's left rear axle,
blasting the tire off and LIFTING the car INTO THE AIR. It
hangs there for a heart-stopping moment, before FALLING.

Coming down on its roof with an enormous splash into the
WHITE HOUSE SWIMMING POOL!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Horrified gasps. Onscreen, the President's Limo sinking...
INT. THE BEAST (SINKING) - MORNING

Upside down. Through the windshield, we see the bottom of
the pool. Cale lies on the roof. The President hangs above

him, still buckled in. Smoke filling the cabin...

CALE
Wikipedia lies.

Sawyer releases his seatbelt and tumbles down onto the roof
beside him.

CALE (CONT'D)
You okay?

The President nods, coughing. Looks at him.
PRESIDENT SAWYER
You can't let them take me alive. A
sitting President cannot become aa
hostage... you understand?
Cale nods. Checks his pistol. Grasps the door handle.

CALE
Deep breath!

They both take one and Cale opens the door - WATER RUSHING
in to the car...
84.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE POOL - MORNING

Cale and Sawyer surface sputtering in the shallow end.
Dragging each other out of the water as the SUV's pull toa
halt. Bishop, Stenz, and the others stepping out.

BISHOP
Freeze!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Watching the LIVE FEED from CNN - a helicopter shot. Bishop's
men have the President and Cale dead to rights.

FINNERTY
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE POOL - MORNING

Cale and the President stand dripping in the morning sun.
Bishop holds his gun on them. Shouts across to Cale:

BISHOP
Who are you!

Cale looks up. Breathing hard. Shouts back:

CALE
I was on the tour!

Bishop bursts out laughing. Too much. Then:

BISHOP
Put the guns down! There's nowhere
else to run!

Cale and the President look at each other. A moment between
them. Butch and Sundance. And then Cale raises his gun and
OPENS FIRE.

Suddenly everyone is firing, and Cale and the President run
to the POOLHOUSE behind them as one of Bishop's men jumps on
the MINI-GUN and --

BISHOP (CONT'D)
No!

-- PULLS THE TRIGGER, the thing spinning to life, GRINDING
BULLETS through the poolhouse, and Bishop screams at him to
stop, as the structure is ripped to swiss cheese and there
must be a gasline in there because as Bishop runs towards it
85.

The Poolhouse ERUPTS INTO a FIREBALL. The whole building
consumed the explosion, Bishop blown backwards off his feet!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

FINNERTY
No!

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - TIMES SQUARE - MORNING

People gathered below the giant screen watch in horror as
the structure the President ran into becomes an inferno.

Some weeping. Others embrace. A terrible moment...
EXT. WHITE HOUSE POOL - MORNING

Bishop, streaked with ash. He slowly gets to his feet,
staring at the burning wreckage. Nothing could have survived.

BISHOP
Get me Finnerty.

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Finnerty pushing back tears herself when

AGENT KELLERMAN
Bishop's on the line for you.

She swallows and takes the phone.
FINNERTY
You son of a bitch. You swore to
protect him-
EXT. WHITE HOUSE POOL - MORNING
BISHOP
The President of the United States
is dead. You have 22 minutes.
He hangs up.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - CONFERENCE ROOM

Silence. The Vice President stares at the shocked faces of
the cabinet onscreen. Everyone shaken. He speaks softly:
86.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Ladies and Gentlemen... considering
what we just witnessed, I don't think
a vote is necessary, do you?

Heads are shaken. Several murmured "no's". Wallace turns
to Jenna, who is also crying.

WALLACE
Jenna, could you please find us a
bible?

TIMECUT TO - Hammond's palm being placed on a bible. As we
hear his voice, we begin CUTTING AROUND the country to images
of people watching the destruction at the WHITE HOUSE:

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND (V.O.)
I, Alvin Hammond, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute the
Office of President of the United
States...

EXT. PENTAGON - MORNING

Three sleek BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS cutting through the
restricted airspace, coming in for a landing on the roof of
the Pentagon...

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND (V.O.)
And will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

The choppers touch down and COMMANDER PAUL CAMERON (handsome,
30's) steps off, in full battle armor, flanked by Lieutenants.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...-So help me God.

As Cameron and his men descend into the building
CNN NEWSCASTER (0.S.)
Word coming now that Vice President
Alvin Hammond has been sworn in as
the 47th President of the United
States...
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Kellerman slaps down a medical file on the table.
87.

AGENT KELLERMAN

Medical records from Bishop's doctor
in McLean. He's got a tumor in his
head the size of a golf ball.
Diagnosed six weeks ago, inoperable.

(off their looks)
There's more. Forensic accounting
found this. 50 million was
transferred into Muriel Bishop's
account 12 hours ago.

They stare at each other.

RAPHELSON
That kind of money means this is
state sponsored. China, North Korea,
Iran-

FINNERTY
How does it benefit another country
to destabilize a nuclear superpower?

AGENT KELLERMAN
Maybe they weren't thinking that far
ahead.

Colonel Janowitz hangs up the phone.

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Delta's here.

The doors to the Bunker open and CAMERON AND HIS LIEUTENANTS
stride in, snapping off a salute to Raphelson.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Mr. Speaker, I'm Commander Paul
Cameron, Delta Force - I'm ready to
brief on the incursion plan?

RAPHELSON
Is this something you threw together
in the last half hour?

COMMANDER CAMERON
No, sir, this is long standing.
We've run drills on this.

FINNERTY
You've run drills on assaulting the
White House?
88.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Ma'am, we've run drills on everything.
Initially we thought we'd go in
through the tunnels, but you say
they've been wired?

A VOICE from behind them speaks up:
TED (0.S.
Yes, but I-I-I- may have a solution
to that.

They all turn to see a SHORT BESPECTACLED MAN in schlumpy
attire clutching a raft of papers standing there. Nervous.

FINNERTY
Who are you?

TED
I'm Ted.

FINNERTY
Ted?

TED

Theodore Lasky. I- I- you said you

needed an explosives expert in here?
(off their looks)

I'm from Homeland, I come up with

different ways to blow things up.

FINNERTY
How do you get a job like that, Ted?

TED
You really don't want to know. But
I think the devices in the tunnels
can be defeated.

COMMANDER CAMERON
You think.

TED
Hypothetically, yes.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Hypothetical doesn't cut it. Bishop's
going to start executing hostages in
18 minutes, so we're going to go in
over the top.

(MORE )
89.

COMMANDER CAMERON (CONT'D)

(points to blueprints)
We're going to land two Blackhawks
on the North and South Lawn here and
here, make them have to defend both
sides. Our guess is Command and
Control is located somewhere in the
West Wing, so we make that the choke
point.

RAPHELSON
What about the approach?

COMMANDER CAMERON
Satellite shows they only have anti-
tank capabilities on the roof, no
surface to air missiles, nothing
that can lock on to an aircraft. We
go in fast and hard, hose down the
roof, then make it a ground war.

From the Communications Desk:

COLONEL JANOWITZ
I have the President of the United
States on the line?

They all look up at this, surprised. Then the VICE
PRESIDENT's image pops up on the viewscreen.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Commander.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Mr. President.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
I'd first like to take a moment of
silence for President Sawyer. He
was a true patriot and a good friend-

RAPHELSON
With all due respect, sir, we don't
have time for a moment of silence.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Then let me ask this; why is this
option better than scrambling a couple
of F-15s out of Andrews and putting
a few sidewinders up Bishop's ass?

Raphelson blinks.
90.

RAPHELSON
You want to call in an air strike on
the White House?

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
I want an option that doesn't risk
the lives of American fighting men
and women.

FINNERTY
And what about the hostages, sir?
What are they, collateral damage?

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
They're dead anyway if this fails.
We level the White House with an air
strike, not only will we end this,
but we will show the world that we
will go to any lengths to combat
terrorism, both foreign and domestic.

WALLACE
You would be sending a very clear
message, sir...

RAPHELSON
Alvy, please, don't do this-

WALLACE
Mr. Speaker, you are addressing the
President of the United States.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Mr. President? This is Commander
Cameron.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Yes, Commander?

COMMANDER CAMERON
I don't want to write off any
Americans in there just yet. Trust
me, sir. We'll get your house back
for you.

Silence as Hammond considers this.

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Mission's a go, Commander.

COMMANDER CAMERON
Thank you, sir.
91.
Cameron races out of the room, Finnerty following...

VICE PRESIDENT HAMMOND
Colonel, get on the phone to Andrews,
I want three F-15s fueled and ready
to launch if this goes wrong.

EXT. PENTAGON ROOF - MORNING

Finnerty follows Cameron to his chopper as the rotor blades
spin up. Cameron, to his men:

COMMANDER CAMERON
Assault on Castle is a go, flight
time to the target is six minutes!

He looks at Finnerty, questioning. She struggles with it.

FINNERTY
I know Martin Bishop!

COMMANDER CAMERON
And?

FINNERTY
He'll be in the Oval Office! You
get close enough, mini-gun should be
able to cut through the glass! Good
luck!

She offers Cameron a hand and he shakes it. She steps back
as the Blackhawks lift up into the air...

INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING
Dark and musty. Deep beneath the earth.

Two figures come into view. Cale, supporting a limping
President Sawyer. Both very much alive.

CALE
Tunnel under the pool house. God
bless Harry Truman.

The President chuckles. It turns into a cough.

CALE (CONT'D)
Any chance this leads out of here?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I think just back to the Residence...
I gotta stop for a sec.
92.

Cale lowers the President down into a sitting position.
Sawyer coughs again into his fist. Looks at his hand. Blood.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
That's not good, is it?

Cale opens Sawyer's jacket, searching in. Finds the source
of the problem - a hunk of SHRAPNEL the size of a large pencil
sticks out of the President's side.

CALE
Shit. We're gonna have to take that
out.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You go to medical school in the last
ten minutes and forget to tell me?

Cale kneels down next to him.

CALE
It's not near a major artery, but if
it gets infected you'll die, and
that would look really bad on my
resume. I'm gonna remove it and
clean the wound, okay?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Okay.
(pause)
I'm scared.

CALE
Under the circumstances, I'd say
that's the correct response.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Your bedside manner sucks, you know
that?

CALE
Relax, I've done this before.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Where?

CALE
Afghanistan.

The President looks at him.
93.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I'm sorry.

CALE
I'm not. You ready?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Tell me when you're gonna pull it
out, okay?

CALE
Okay.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Wait, no don't. I don't want to
know.

CALE
So you just want me to do it.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
No. No, tell me.

CALE
All right, I'm gonna pull it out on
the count of three. One...

He yanks out the shrapnel. Blood. Sawyer SCREAMS.
PRESIDENT SAWYER

Goddammit! You're fired! You are
so goddamn fired! SHIT!

CALE
I have to clean it now. Don't pass
out.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Why not?

CALE
Okay, solid point.

His hands dip below frame and he begins to clean the wound.
PRESIDENT SAWYER
Talk to me, okay? Take my mind off
it...

CALE
What do you want to hear?
Oops.

94.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Baseball scores, I don't know,
anything, your daughter, tell me
about your daughter.

CALE
Her name is Emily. She's ten. She
loves you. A lot. She begged me to
vote for you.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You didn't vote for me?

CALE
Well, you know, you wanted to raise
taxes-

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Only on the richest one percent of
the--goddammit, you didn't vote for

me?

CALE
What can I say? She's smarter than
I am.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Clearly.

CALE
Yeah, I don't know when that happened.
Half the time it makes me proud, the
other half it drives me nuts. But
she's smarter. And she hates me.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I'm sure she doesn't.

CALE
I'm sure she does. She thinks I
left her. When I went overseas.
She's right. I did. She was six
years old and then poof! No Dad.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You did what you had to.

CALE
People say that. Doesn't change
anything, though, does it?

(MORE )
95.

CALE (CONT'D)

(pause)
And if she makes it out and we don't,
the last thing she's gonna see of me
is video of trying to get you out.
Leaving her behind. Again.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
That's not how this ends.

He means it. Cale smiles.

CALE
When they're young, they run up to
you and hug you, and shout "Daddy!"
And then one day it just stops. No
one tells you that. I'd give anything
to have that hug one more time.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You know what my daughter Paula wants
for her fifteenth birthday? A belly
button ring. Who the hell is equipped
to deal with that?

Cale laughs. Looking at Sawyer.

CALE
Daughters.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Yeah...

Cale leans back, work finished.

CALE
How are you feeling?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Surprisingly okay.

CALE
Told you I knew what I was doing.
(digs out satphone)
I'm gonna call in, let them know
we're not dead.

He dials the phone.
96.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Finnerty looks up at the ringing phone in disbelief. Looks
at the caller ID. Could only be one person. Answering it:

FINNERTY
Cale?

INTERCUT:

CALE
Alive and kicking. We're in the
tunnels under the pool house.

FINNERTY
And the President?

CALE
He's hurt, but he'll be okay.

Cheering in the Pentagon Bunker.

FINNERTY
That great news! Stay put, the
cavalry's coming!

CALE
Delta?

FINNERTY
They're in the air, should be hitting
the Residence in four minutes.

Cale smiles fades.

CALE
In the air? No, no, it's gotta be a
ground assault- Bishop's got surface
to air missiles, if they come in by
air, it'll be a turkey shoot!

FINNERTY
Satellite showed the roof was clear-

CALE
He's keeping them in the basement so
you can't see- you have to call
them off!
97.
EXT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS (FLYING) - MORNING
A COLUMN of BLACKHAWKS sweep across the Potomac. Through
the open doors we see the soldiers checking their weapons,
going through pre-battle rituals. Land coming up...
COMMANDER CAMERON
All right, hug the deck, we go in
low and quiet!

The Blackhawks drop down to fifty feet above the ground
rushing past below, swooping between buildings...

COMMANDER CAMERON (CONT'D)
Time to target is three minutes!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Finnerty curses and throws aside the radio.
FINNERTY
They've gone dark for the assault,
there's no way to raise them!
INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING
FINNERTY (0.S.)
(through phone)

There's nothing we can do!

Cale, realizing those men are going to die. He looks to the
President.

CALE
Sir...?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Go.

Cale grabs his assault rifle and RUNS. Booking down the
tunnel, back towards the White House...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop re-entering, talking into his radio to his men:
BISHOP

They'11 be coming now, so move the
SAMs to the roof. Mulchay, be ready.
98.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING
Mulchay, scanning the horizon with his scope...

MULACHY
Roger that.

INT. WHITE HOUSE CORRIDORS - MORNING

Bishop's men roll DOLLIES stacked with SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE
crates onto elevators. Men rush to their assigned posts.
Like a submarine preparing for battle...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - MORNING

The Guards checking their weapons. Emily hears the commotion
in the corridors. Whispering to Donnie:

EMILY
What's going on?

He shakes his head, no idea.

EMILY (CONT'D)
You think it's my Dad?

INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING

Cale, the Dad in question, running flat-out. Screaming into
the cell-phone:

CALE
If I can get to the roof before they
fire the missiles, I might be able
to stop them!

Coming up to the chicken-wire gate with the EXPLOSIVES wired
to it! He can't go through without setting it off!

CALE (CONT'D)
Shit! I'm gonna need some help here
with the bomb!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Finnerty spins around, scanning the room.

FINNERTY
Ted? Ted!

No sign of him.
99.

FINNERTY (CONT'D)
Where's Ted?

AGENT KELLERMAN
I think he went to the bathroom...

FINNERTY
Now?!

EXT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS (FLYING) - MORNING
Weaving through the streets of DC...

COMMANDER CAMERON
Two minutes to Castle...

INT. PENTAGON - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

Empty, save for a man sitting in the far stall. We hear
pages turning. Whistling. Serenity.

Suddenly, Kellerman bursts in. Kicks in the stall door
revealing TED, pants around his ankles, reading a copy of In
Touch magazine. He grabs Ted and hauls him out...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Stenz emerges onto the roof with the crates of SAMs. Mulcahy
raises a crowbar and cracks the first box open, revealing a
SHOULDER-MOUNT LAUNCHER...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Finnerty hustles Ted into a chair and hands him an earpiece
to speak to Cale with. INTERCUT:

TED
John Cale? This is Ted Lasky, I
work at Homeland Security-

FINNERTY
He doesn't care where you work, Ted!

TED
Okay, there are three possible ways
for you to disarm this particular
device. Do you by any chance have
an engineering degree?

CALE
No.
100.

TED
Okay, two possible ways for you to
disarm this particular device. Do
you see the yellow wire?

CALE
(reaches for it)
Yes.

TED
Don't touch it. It's the decoy.
What about the green wire?

Cale looks.

CALE
There are six green wires.

TED
Are some of them a lighter green
than others?

CALE
There are six green wires.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

The sound of helicopters approaching. As Stenz loads a
missile into Mulcahy's launcher...

INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING

TED
Okay, you need to pull the green
wires sequentially, starting from
the left, moving to the right. Don't
let more than two seconds pass between
pulling each one. Are you ready?

Cale exhales. Puts his hand over the first green wire.

CALE
Ready.

TED
Go. Wait.

Cale pulls his hand away.

CALE
Jesus Christ, what?
101.

TED
Is there writing on the side of the
device? A company name?

CALE
(reading)
"Snyder".

TED
This is Snyder? That changes
everything...

CALE
What do I do, Ted?

TED
Well, don't touch the green wires,
that's for sure.
INT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS (FLYING) - MORNING

One minute out. Cameron pops in a stick of gum and crosses
himself...

INT. WHITE HOUSE CATACOMBS - MORNING

TED
Do you see a power source, like a
battery?
Cale squints.
CALE
I think so.
TED

Unplug it. A bomb is like any other
electrical device, if you deprive it
of its power source, it ceases to
function.

CALE
And it won't explode?

TED
Probably not.

FINNERTY
What if you're wrong?
102.
CALE
Then hopefully the sound of me being
blown into a million pieces will
distract them. Finnerty, if I die?
She knows before he even asks.

FINNERTY
I'll get her out.

Cale swallows. Good enough for him. He reaches forward,
grabs the battery wire, and yanks it out...

No explosion. Cale pulls the bomb off the door, stuffs it
in his satchel, and is through the gate, running for the
stairs...

EXT. BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS (FLYING) - MORNING

Thundering down Constitution Avenue, turning North towards
the White House...

COMMANDER CAMERON
Twenty seconds!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING
Mulchay, hefting the launcher...

MULACHY
Come to Papa...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - MAIN STAIRWELL - MORNING

Cale, shooting two guards on the First Floor landing!
Bounding up the stairs, racing for the roof...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

As the Blackhawks crest into view, charging straight at the
Residence. The Launcher BEEPS...

MULACHY
We have missile lock.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

BISHOP
Fire.
103.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING
As the choppers come in over 15th Street, Humphries FIRES.
A MISSILE streaks out of the launcher, screams through the
air across the length of the South Lawn and enters the Lead
Blackhawk's cockpit at 150 MPH!
The AIRCRAFT BLOWS APART spectacularly, the burning husk of
the cabin smashing down into the White House Fountain,
cracking the concrete and obliterating the water feature!

INT. SECOND BLACKHAWK (FLYING) - MORNING

COMMANDER CAMERON
Holy shit, break left, break left!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

The pilots yank hard on the sticks and the Second and Third
Blackhawks split apart, going left and right respectively!

Stenz slides another missile into Mulachy's launcher, as he
tracks the Second Blackhawk across the sky...

INT. SECOND BLACKHAWK (FLYING) - MORNING
The cockpit's instrument panel goes red and an ALARM SOUNDS:

BLACKHAWK PILOT
They've got missile lock!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Mulchay pulls the trigger and the missile fires! The
Blackhawk Pilot tries to take evasive action, but the missile
SLAMS into rear rotor, ripping the whole tail section off!

INT. SECOND BLACKHAWK (FLYING) - MORNING

COMMANDER CAMERON
Auto-rotate, auto-rotate, we are
going dow-

WHAM! The chopper slams nose-first into the South Lawn,
crushing the cockpit and pilots!

ROTOR BLADES WHIPPING into the dirt, SHEERING OFF, sending
razor sharp debris slicing through the White House fence and
into the buildings across the street!
104.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Stenz reloads Humphries as the Last Blackhawk breaks hugh
and right over the White House...

The launcher BEEPS. They have tone. Missile lock. About
to pull the trigger. The roof door bangs open. They look.

John Cale! He FIRES A BURST through Mulcahy's chest, blowing
him off his feet! The sniper crumples, dropping the launcher!

Cale pivots and looses a burst at Stenz, who is already
running away, SHOOTING BACK at him...

INT. THIRD BLACKHAWK (FLYING) - MORNING
Swinging back around towards the White House...

BLACKHAWK PILOT
(to Gunner)
Take them out!

The Gunner jumps on the deck mounted .50 cal and pulls the
trigger and UNLOADS on the roof!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Cale dives away from the door as it's ripped to swiss-cheese!
Trying to take cover as the Gunner VENTILATES THE ROOF!
Bullets punching through everything!

The Blackhawk swings in high, the remaining Delta members,
getting ready to fast-rope down. The Gunner pauses for them
to get into position, giving Cale time to glance up and see

STENZ. Hoisting the fallen launcher, angling it straight up
at the belly of the chopper and

CALE
No!

Stenz fires. The missile flies and the last Blackhawk BLOWS
APART directly above them! Cale and Stenz both roll away,
trying to dodge the sizzling chunks of debris that rain down!

The FLAMING TAIL SECTION crunches down through the Third
Floor Roof into the Master Bedroom! The cockpit misses the
building completely and smashes down onto the concrete drive
in front of the North Portico four stories below.

And finally, blessed silence.
105.

Cale's eyes blink open. Amazed to be alive. Covered in
soot, grease, and oil. He tries to get to his feet...

WHAM! A bloody fist crashes into his face! Stenz. Alive.
Pissed. He smashes Cale's head into the gravel rooftop...

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - MORNING
Cameron pulls himself and several of his men from the
wreckage of the Second Blackhawk on the South Lawn. All of
them ragged and bloody. He tries to rally them.
COMMANDER CAMERON

We're kicking in the front door!

Come on!
The others bellow back at him in the affirmative and what
remains of the Delta Force charges up the South Lawn towards
the entrance to the West Wing...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop stares out the window. Watching the Last Charge of
the Delta Force. He raises the radio to his lips.

BISHOP

Finish it.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SOUTH LAWN - MORNING
Four of Bishop's men step out onto the South Portico Balcony
and level their weapons at Delta. A raised firing position.
The high ground. They unload.
And the Rose Garden becomes a killing field.
Cameron watches his men to the left and right of him fall in
slow-mo. Bullets rip through him. Still he pushes forward.
Trying to make it to the man in the window of the Oval Office.
Cordite and rose petals swirl in the air around him. He
falls to his knees. Pistol in hand. Firing at Bishop. The
bullets barely nick the glass in front of his face.
They hold each other's gaze for a moment more...

Fresh gunfire from above finishes it. Cameron goes face
down among the roses.

Dead ten feet from the White House.
106.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

Four stories above, Stenz hurls Cale into the side of a
chimney! Beating the shit out of him! Cale, gasping, picks
up a chunk of brick as Stenz lumbers towards him...

Cale turns and swings, connecting with his shoulder! Stenz
screams and Cale tackles him, catching him off balance,
sending both men careening over the side of the roof and

INT. WHITE HOUSE - THIRD FLOOR GREENHOUSE - MORNING

A GLASSED-IN GREENHOUSE on the Third Floor Promenade, just
to the right of the North Portico. Connected to the
Residence, it's where the First Lady grows her herbs.

Cale and Stenz tumble down onto the GREENHOUSE ROOF.
Squeaking and sliding on the glass, as they struggle --

The glass begins to SPIDER-WEB with cracks. They freeze.
Looking at one another. The glass, stretching, groaning...

BOOM. It shatters. Cale and Stenz plummet into the
greenhouse proper, smashing down onto herb beds! Cale is up
first, grabbing a piece of glass and slashing at Stenz!

On him, punching him, finally getting the upper hand!

CALE
You like that?

Stenz crashes Cale back into a shelf of pots, as the door
flies open and Bishop's Man MOTTS opens fire and Cale screams
as a bullet tears a chunk out of his shoulder!

STENZ
Give it to me!

Stenz grabs the rifle and wheels around to finish Cale, who
seeing no other option HURLS HIMSELF THROUGH THE GLASS!

Cale smashes outwards into space, legs kicking as he leaps
OFF THE THIRD FLOOR BALCONY!

Stenz screams in frustration and runs to the edge, FIRING
DOWN into the foliage below! But it's no use.

Cale is gone.
107.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

The TVs still playing the horrible aftermath of the Blackhawk
attack. Finnerty snatches up a ringing phone.

FINNERTY
Are you okay?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop, on the other end. Pissed.

BISHOP
That was stupid.

INTERCUT - Finnerty taken aback, not who she expected.

FINNERTY
Martin-

BISHOP
You knew I'd be ready for an attack
but you sent them in anyway. You
made me kill them-

FINNERTY
I didn't make you do anything. I
know about the cancer.
That stops him for a moment.

FINNERTY (CONT'D)
Nobody else had to die, Martin.

He looks at the bodies in the Rose Garden...
BISHOP
I didn't want them too. But because
of you, now I have to do this.

FINNERTY
Do what?

BISHOP
Retaliate.

Hr hangs up the phone and grabs the walkie.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Tyler, do you have his location?
108.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING
Lollipop in mouth, fingers flying, INTERCUT:

A beautiful mountain range. Sun shines. Birds chirp.

SUPERIMPOSE - NORAD - North American Aerospace Air Defense

INT. NORAD - CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN - OPERATIONS CENTER - MORNING

The whole Operations Center carved into the mountainside.
Dozens of TECHS man terminals. One Tech blinks in disbelief.
To his WATCH COMMANDER:

NORAD TECHNICIAN
Sir, my weapons system is coming
online! It's being accessed remotely,
I can't- Jesus Christ, it's targeting!

WATCH COMMANDER
Ch (sprinting over)
What?

NORAD TECHNICIAN
It's firing!

EXT. OHIO COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

THREE BALLISTIC MISSILES roar out of a mountaintop silo and
climb into the sky...

The whole place in an uproar.
NORAD TECHNICIAN
We have three away! Non-nuclear

ballistic missiles-

Holy shit, we have incoming! Three

super-sonic-

CAPTAIN DIX
I have the stick!

He grabs the stick as the plane bucks out of auto-pilot!
INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

The Vice President and others thrown to the floor as Dix

F-15 PILOT

They're going for heat signatures,

we're going to try and draw them

He and the other pilot break off as the missiles streak in!
One missile pulls away from the others, following the heat
signature of the F-15!
The pilot climbing as fast as he can, pulling 3G's, but --
THOOM! The F-15 FIREBALLS!
INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - COCKPIT - MORNING

CAPTAIN DIX
Two left! Deploying chaff!
110.
He stabs a button and...
EXT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING
A hatch on the tail opens and METALIZED GLASS fibers SPEW
out of the back of the plane! Spitting tons of the stuff,

hoping to distract the missile guidance system.

And it works! One of the missiles streaks left past the
plane and out over Lake Abram!

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - COCKPIT

CO-PILOT
One to go!

CAPTAIN DIX
We're gonna out-climb the son of a
bitch!

He hauls back on the stick, taking the plane to a seventy
degree climb...

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - CABIN - MORNING

People tumble through the cabin like dice, screaming and
crying as they try and claw their way to their seats!

Jenna weeping as she buckles herself in, her eyes finding
Agent Graham across from her...

The final missile zeroing in on them, as they tear into the
upper atmosphere, the missile's nose cone icing over...

INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - COCKPIT
CAPTAIN DIX
We dive and hit the chaff, he flies
right past!

He slams the stick forward, levelling the plane, smashes
down the chaff button and

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - MORNING

Chaff blasts out of the back as the plane goes into a CRASH-
DIVE! The missile miraculously keeps climbing!

He pumps his fist as Captain Dix whoops for joy!

EXT. OHIO COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

FIVE MORE MISSILES streak out of the silo into the air...

Oh, God.

CAPTAIN DIX

Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm so sorry...
INT. AIR FORCE ONE (FLYING) - CABIN - MORNING

People screaming, confused. Jenna looks at Graham. Knows
this is it. Her hand finds his. Their fingers entwined...

Fire blossoms as the first missile strikes Air Force One.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Raphelson, Finnerty, and the others staring at the Vice
President's viewscreen. No image. Just STATIC. Colonel
Janowitz speaks into a phone and then hangs up.
COLONEL JANOWITZ
(softly)
We have confirmation of ground impact.

Silence. Raphelson turns away. Finnerty looks for something
to punch. No one knows what to say.

Finally:
FINNERTY
We're going to need to swear you in,

sir.

It takes Raphelson a moment to realize she's looking at him.
112.

RAPHELSON
No. If President Sawyer's still
alive in there-

FINNERTY
It doesn't matter. Executive power
passed to the Vice President when he
was sworn in, which means... the
office now passes to you.

RAPHELSON
Jesus Christ...

The phone rings. Finnerty punches it through on speaker.

BISHOP
Did you get my message?

FINNERTY
You son of a bitch.

BISHOP
Name calling aside, our timetable
still stands. You have...
(checks his watch)
Six minutes to our deadline.

FINNERTY
What do you want these prisoners
for?

BISHOP

Not your concern-

FINNERTY
Why are you doing this?

Raphelson puts a hand on her shoulder.

RAPHELSON
We need more time, Mr. Bishop. We
can't release all the prisoners in
six minutes, one them's in Iran, for
Chrissakes!

BISHOP
Well, then you better go get him.

RAPHELSON
It's not that simple-
113.

BISHOP
It is exactly that simple. In fact,
let me show you how simple it is -
you're originally from Denver,
Colorado, is that right Mr. Speaker?

A beat.

RAPHELSON
Yes.

BISHOP
If I don't have confirmation in the
next six minutes that you are
liberating Sadaam Al-Hafra from his
prison, in addition to executing
hostages here, I will fire a missile
on downtown Denver. Sound fair?

Raphelson clenching his fists so hard they're shaking...

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Six minutes, sir.

Bishop breaks the connection.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Interrupted as STENZ strides into the Oval, cut and bloody.

STENZ
He's still alive.

BISHOP
Who?

STENZ

The tourist. He killed Mulchay and
Konner on the roof.

BISHOP
Alone?

Stenz nods. Bishop thinks for a moment.
BISHOP (CONT'D)
Maybe he's not. Who comes on a tour
alone?

A beat. Bishop grabs the walkie.
114.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Tyler, can you stream me video of
everyone who came in for the tour
this morning?

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Silence. Raphelson exhales. Looks up at the others.

RAPHELSON
I know what it looks like. But I
swear to you, we're not beaten yet.
Colonel, get me the base commander
at Andrews.

Finnerty looks up, surprised.

FINNERTY
Sir?

COLONEL JANOWITZ
General Pierce is on the line, sir.

RAPHELSON
General, this is Eli Raphelson. The
Vice President had instructed you to
fuel three fully loaded F-15s with a
target package for the White House,
is that correct?

GENERAL PIECRE

Yes, sir.

RAPHELSON
I want you to launch those planes,
General.

GENERAL PIECRE
Roger that, sir. Tower, you are
clear to launch.

We hear him giving more orders as Finnerty looks at Raphelson,
stunned.

FINNERTY
Mr. Speaker-

RAPHELSON
We have to end this, Carol. We give
him more time, who knows how many
more weapons systems they can control?
115.

FINNERTY
And the White House?
RAPHELSON
Look what we've already been through

today.

(hand on her shoulder)
Our country is stronger than one
house.

EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - MORNING

THREE F-15's fire up their thrusters and streak off from the
tarmac into the morning air, headed towards Washington DC...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop and Stenz, scrolling through security footage...

STENZ
There.

Bishop stops it - the IMAGE OF CALE AND EMILY coming in,
Emily shrugging off Cale's embrace. Father and daughter.

STENZ (CONT'D)
I know her. We have her in the
SitRoom.

BISHOP
Bring her here.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - MORNING

Emily sits with the Tour Guide. A small commotion near the
front of the room. Emily looks up to see Stenz standing in
the doorway. He points to her.

STENZ
Come on pretty, we got a date.

The others shrink away from him.

DONNIE THE GUIDE
What are you going to do to her?

Stenz ignores this. Moves for Emily. Donnie steps between
them, using every last bit of courage he has.

DONNIE THE GUIDE (CONT'D)
You're going to have to go through
me.
116.

Stenz pauses. Seems to consider this for a moment. Then
pulls out his pistol and SHOOTS Donnie in the stomach!

Emily screams. Donnie falls. Stenz grabs Emily and drags
her from the room...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING

Deserted hallways. Stenz pulls Emily along, on their way to
the Oval Office.

EMILY
You're going to go to jail for that.

STENZ
Yeah? Who's gonna make me?

Emily looks at him.

EMILY
Who did that to your face?

Pissed, Stenz pushes her along...
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
COLONEL JANOWITZ
Birds are in the air, sir! Time to
target is 15 minutes!
He sets the wall clock to count it down...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop's watch beeps. The deadline up. He picks up the
phone. INTERCUT with the Pentagon:

BISHOP
Your time is up, gentlemen.

Finnerty slides Raphelson a note "NEED TO BUY TIME".
Raphelson takes a deep breath.

RAPHELSON
We'll give you what you want.
(to Colonel Janowitz)
Tell the SEAL Commander the Iranian
incursion is a go.

As he says this, he shakes his head at Janowitz - don't do
it. Finnerty, playing along:
117.

FINNERTY
But sir, the Peace Accord-

RAPHELSON
That's an order!

Bishop smiles.

BISHOP
Very good. We'll wait for
confirmation the prisoners have been
freed.

RAPHELSON
And then?

BISHOP
Then you will receive further
instructions. You made the right
choice, Mr. President.

They hear Bishop break the connection. Pan up to the
airstrike countdown clock on the wall. 14 MINUTES...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

As Bishop hangs up, Stenz enters with Emily. She looks
around. The actual Oval Office. And a man sitting behind
the Resolute Desk. Not the President. He smiles at her.

BISHOP
Hi there, sweetie. Let's have a
conversation about you and your Dad...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - FLOWER SHOP - MORNING

The room in the basement where all of the floral arrangements
are put together. Deserted. Flowers lay strewn about the
different tables. The sound of GLASS breaking.

Cale slides in through a window. Cradling his machine gun.

Torn and bloody. He limps over to one of the tables. Finds
a roll of packing tape. Tries to wrap it around the bullet

wound in his shoulder. Stifles a scream as he does so.

He takes a breath. Gathering himself. Moves to the door.
Looks out into the hall. The stairwell down to the catacombs
down to the left. He moves for it...

The White house PUBLIC ADDRESS system crackles on:
118.

BISHOP (0.S.)
Good morning, Mr. Cale!

His voice echoes throughout the complex. Cale blinks - Bishop
knows his name.

BISHOP (0.S.) (CONT'D)
You've proved to be a quite a nuisance
this morning, so I wanted to let you
know that I'm sitting here with
someone who wants to say hello. Say
hello, Sweetie!

EMILY (0.S.)
Hello.

Cale's face - Oh, Jesus, no.
BISHOP (0.S.)
Would you like to tell your father
what I'm holding in my hand?

EMILY (0.S.)
A gun.

Oh God. Cale begins to sprint-limp through the hallway.
Doesn't even know where he's going, just trying to get to
the source of the voices...
BISHOP (0.S.)
Is there anything you'd like to say
to him before we do this?
EMILY (0.S.)
They're holding forty of us in the
Situation Room-
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Bishop claps a hand over Emily's mouth. Gives her a smile.

BISHOP
Not like that.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - BASEMENT HALL - MORNING

Cale looking at his cheap White House Map, desperately
scanning it for the location to the Situation Room...

INTERCUT:
119.

BISHOP
Mr. Cale, I'm going to count to three.
Wherever you are, I advise you to
start trying to signal one of my
men, because if they don't have you
in their custody by the time I reach
three, I'm going to shoot your little
girl in the stomach. One...

Cale can't believe it, it's all happening too fast...

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Two...

Cale opens his mouth to scream, but

VOICE (0.S.)
Hey, over here! Here!

Footsteps go running towards the voice - what the hell?
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

BISHOP
...Three.

A beat. Bishop looks Emily in the eye.
BISHOP (CONT'D)
Guess Daddy doesn't love you after
all.
Stenz raises his weapon when the radio squawks:
MOTTS (0.S.)
(through radio)
We have him, sir.
BISHOP
(into radio)
Cale?
INT. WHITE HOUSE - CENTER HALL - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING

MOTTS
No, sir. The President.

Motts and another man stand with PRESIDENT SAWYER who has
just surrendered himself. INTERCUT:
120.

BISHOP
Well, that changes things. Get him
up here.

They march Sawyer up the center stairs. Cale watches from
around the corner. He could shoot, but what if he hit Sawyer?
What if that made them kill Emily? He watches them go,
powerless. Curses. Pulls out the satphone...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Finnerty snatches up the phone. INTERCUT:

CALE
They have the President.

FINNERTY
Cale, you have to get out of there.
Help's not coming.

CALE
Didn't you hear what I said-

FINNERTY
They killed the Vice President. An
air strike's been called in on the
White House.

CALE
No-

FINNERTY
Yes. You have to go.

Cale takes a breath.

CALE
They still have hostages. They still
have Emily.

FINNERTY

Then you have 12 minutes to figure
out a way to get them out.

Cale doesn't respond. He's staring across the hall at the
painting of the White House in 1814...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Motts leads President Sawyer into his own Oval Office. He
stops in the door to see Bishop sitting behind his desk.
121.

Emily sits in the corner, guarded by Stenz. Motts offers up
a pistol to Bishop.

MOTTS
He had this on him.

Bishop takes the gun, tsk-tsking him.

BISHOP
Whatever happened to the pen is
mightier than the sword?

Sawyer looks at him.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
As President of the United States, I
want you to know that this comes
with the full weight, power, and
authority of my office - Fuck you.

Bishop smiles. President Sawyer looks to Emily.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
You okay?

She gives him a tight nod.

BISHOP
I made sure your family wasn't here
for this. So now I want you to do
something for me. Sit.

Sawyer doesn't move. Motts kicks him in the back of the
knee, driving Sawyer into a chair.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
Each President is given a twelve
digit passcode, it changes every
three months. I need yours.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
It won't get you access to the weapons
systems-

BISHOP
It's not the weapons systems I'm
after, sir.

Sawyer stares at him. Realizing:
122.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You're data-farming? That's what
this is all about?

BISHOP

You say that like it's some minor
goal. This building contains more
critical information onsite than any
other structure in the world. Defense
allocations, national security
protocols, troop locations and
movements in three separate ongoing
wars. Do you even comprehend what
those secrets are worth? We'll open
the bidding at 100 billion. I think
the Chinese will ultimately take it,
but the Russians will give them a
run for their money.

(off his look)
What? Did you think we were here
for you? Now. The passcode.

The President can't believe it.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You're did all this for money?

BISHOP
I have a tumor in my head that's
supposed to kill me before Arbor
Day. Who's going to take care of my
family, Mr. President? You?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
And your solution is to throw away
decades of service to this country?

BISHOP
Maybe spending the last twenty-five
years seeing what vain petty people
you are all helped. This country's
sole operating principal for the
last two hundred years has been "Get
as much as you can for yourself and
screw the other guy." So after twenty-
five years, that's what I'm doing,
Mr. President. I'm getting mine.
The American Way.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
What about your kids? What will
they think when you're gone?
123.

BISHOP
Money's the most important thing in
this country, right? Well, they're
about to have a lot of it.
(levels the gun)
Now. The passcode.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
You know I can't.

Bishop sighs and points the gun at Emily.

BISHOP
Do we really have to do this again?

PRESIDENT SAWYER
If I give it to you, our enemies
will know everything.

BISHOP
Just the ones who can pay.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Our country will be over.

BISHOP
There comes a day when all empires
must fall, Mr. President.
(cocks the gun)
I'm going to count to three...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(to Emily)
I can't give it to him, you understand-

WHAP! Stenz pistol-whips the President in the mouth! He
spits blood. Emily looks at him. Locks eyes.

EMILY
I understand.

BISHOP
One...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
(to Emily)
I'm sorry.

BISHOP
Two...

Emily closes her eyes...
124.
A KLAXON goes off. Sounding throughout the complex.

STENZ
What the hell?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - P.E.O.C. - MORNING
Tyler, staring at his screen in disbelief. Into the radio:

TYLER
I have thermal alarms going off in
two- wait, no, three different
locations! Third floor kitchen,
second floor hall, second floor East
Bedroom-

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

EMILY
(to President Sawyer)
What does that mean?

BISHOP
It means your father just set fire
to the White House.
(into radio)
Send teams to put them out, we can't
let the building go up yet-

STENZ
We don't have teams anymore, sir!

BISHOP
Then peel men off the Situation Room,
this building's a two hundred year
old tinderbox!

A new alarm wails.
TYLER (0.S.)
(through radio)
Fourth Alarm! Fire in the Lincoln
Bedroom!

As if on cue, the SPRINKLERS go off above them! Drenching
everyone in the Oval Office.

Bishop, furious, tosses Stenz and M4 rifle.

BISHOP
Kill him.
125.

STENZ
With pleasure.

He turns and bolts for the room. Bishop, into the walkie:

BISHOP
Shut those off!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING
Colonel Janowitz, in contact with the F-15's...

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Six minutes to target, sir!

AGENT KELLERMAN
Sir, you need to see this...

He turns the sound up on CNN - which now shows smoke pouring
out of the Second and Third floor of the White House!

CNN NEWSCASTER
Smoke began pouring from the structure
minutes ago, leading us to believe
that the upper floors of the White
House are in fact on fire...

Finnerty looks to Raphelson.

FINNERTY
It's Cale.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - MORNING

The door to the Situation Room opens and TWO MEN barrel out
of it, running to the stairs, turning the corner to find

Cale, who opens up with the machine gun! The men fall!
Cale races towards the Sit Room door. Humphries steps out
FIRING, and Cale dives to the ground, spraying back!

A waterford crystal vase explodes in the hallway as Cale
rolls sideways, strafing the door! Humphries goes down
screaming, bullets punching through his legs! Cale is up
and runs into

INT. SITUATION ROOM - MORNING

He pushes through the hostages, finding the wounded Tour
Guide being tended to on the floor.
126.

CALE
Where is she?

DONNIE THE GUIDE
They took her to the Oval Office!

Cale looks around to the others.
CALE
There's an air strike coming! Get
everyone out of here now!

Total panic now. People screaming, pushing through doors!
Cale running with them...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
Raphelson, eyes glued to the television.
FINNERTY
Something's happening in there! We

have to give him more time!

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Four minutes, sir!

EXT. VIRGINIA SKIES - MORNING

The F-15'S STREAK towards Washington...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - MORNING
As people pour out of the SitRoom, Cale runs for the West
stairs, bounding up them, to the First Floor. Rounding a
corner into

WHAM! A bloody fist to the face again!

Stenz. Cale's gun goes sprawling. Stenz sends another rib-
cracking punch to his gut, sending him hurtling back into

the Press Room!

STENZ
I'm gonna enjoy this...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop raises his gun and BLAM! SHOOTS the President in the
leg! Sawyer screams, doubling over!
127.

BISHOP
That's the femoral artery. Unless I
stop it, you're going to bleed out
in that chair. What's the code?

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

ON CNN - The hostages now STREAMING out of the building across
the North and South Lawns!

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Three minutes, sir!

FINNERTY
(to Raphelson)
Give the man a chance!

EXT. WEST COLONNADE - MORNING

SMASH! Cale is HURLED through the double glass doors by the
Briefing Room out onto the Colonnade! Landing in a bloody
heap. Stenz, advancing on him...

STENZ
Your daughter says you're going to
take me to jail. So are you?

Stenz KICKS HIM. Cale grunts as the force of it propels him
into a column. Stenz pulls a knife.

STENZ (CONT'D)
I'm gonna carve my fucking name into
your chest.

He leans down as Cale rolls and smashes both feet into Stenz's
left knee! The knee BUCKLES and Stenz screams, falling!

Cale yanks something from his satchel and slams it into
Stenz's chest. Stenz looks - it's the BOMB from the tunnels.
His eyes lock with Cale.

CALE
No jail for you.

He pulls all six green wires and RUNS. Stenz screams a second
before he BLOWS APART...

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

ON CNN - the ENTIRE WEST COLONNADE EXPLODES! Chunks of pillar
and roof are blasted out as far as the street!
128.

CNN NEWSCASTER
Holy shit!

Inside the Bunker, Finnerty gasps. Behind her is Ted.
TED
Looks like somebody touched the green
wire...

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop, Sawyer, and Emily are thrown to the ground as the
building rocks on its foundations!

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Emily, run!

The little girl bolts for the door! Motts smacks her in the
back of the head with his pistol, sending her sprawling! He
raises it to kill --

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
No! Wait! I'1l give you the code!

Motts looks at Bishop, who goes to his laptop.

BISHOP
Now, or she dies.

The President takes a breath and begins.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
7. 3. 5. 4...

INT. WHITE HOUSE RESIDENCE - FIRST FLOOR - MORNING

Cale stares at the twisted flaming destruction between him
and the West Wing - no way to get to Emily now. All he's
got left is his pistol. Pops the clip. Looks.

CALE
Three bullets.

Snaps it back. Mind racing.

CALE (CONT'D)
Think, goddammit, think!

His eyes fall onto a very particular doorway that he went
through once before in the film...
129.
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
FINNERTY
For the love of God, sir, you have
to stop this!

He looks at her.

RAPHELSON
What if it's a trick?

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

PRESIDENT SAWYER
3. 9. 4...

He doubles over as a coughing fit overtakes him. Spitting
up more blood.

BISHOP
What's the last number! Tell me!

The President tries to speak, but all that comes out is a
wheeze. Bishop curses and runs over to him. Kneeling down
next to him.

BISHOP (CONT'D)
The last number. Now.

Sawyer mumbling something...

BISHOP (CONT'D)
What?

He leans down, putting his ear to the President's mouth...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
I said, I'm sticking with the pen.

And he pulls the treaty signing PEN from his coat and STABS
BISHOP in the neck with it!

Bishop screams, rearing back against the Resolute Desk clawing
at his neck. As Motts levels his gun to kill Emily and the
President both, we hear an ENGINE ROAR. Motts looks up in
time to see

A BLACK SUV - Ripping through the Rose Garden, coming straight
for them. Cale at the wheel.

We barely has time to process what's about to happen before
130.

The SUV smashes THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW and INTO THE OVAL
OFFICE! Bishop diving out of the way, the desk obliterated
as it slams into Motts and drives him into the far wall,
crushing him!

Water gushes from burst pipes and sparks shoot from sockets!
Part of the roof collapses onto the SUV!

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER
The whole room, screaming at Raphelson:

COLONEL JANOWITZ
45 seconds to target! Pilots are
removing firing triggers!

FINNERTY
Somebody just drove a goddamn car
into the Oval Office, don't do this!

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Sir, I need a go/no go for payload
delivery!

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Bishop tears the pen from his neck and swings his arms out
wildly, grabbing Emily up as Cale collapses out of the vehicle
into the ruined office of the Chief Executive!

Bishop presses the gun to Emily's head, as Cale brings his
own pistol up, training it on him!

Silence. Mexican stand-off. Neither man moving. In the
distance, the roar of jet engines approaching...

Bishop opens his mouth.

BISHOP
I'm going to count to-

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! Cale pulls the trigger. Bishop pitches
back over, holes in his chest.

CALE
Three.

Cale falls to his knees as Emily runs to him. Wrapping her
arms around him.

EMILY
Daddy!
131.
Cale hugs her tight right back...
EXT. F-15'S (FLYING) - MORNING
Roaring over the Potomac, coming up on the White House...
INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

COLONEL JANOWITZ
10 seconds, go/no go!

Raphelson closes his eyes. God forgive him.

RAPHELSON
Go.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING

Cale turns to the hole in the wall to see the jets
approaching. Shoving Emily towards it. Too weak to follow.

CALE
Run, honey!

She looks back at him.

CALE (CONT'D)
Go, I'm right behind you!

Emily looks up at the jets, and suddenly knows what's about
to happen. She scoops up the fallen American Flag on the
office floor and RUNS.

Cale collapses to the floor. Watching her go. At least
she'll be safe...

INT. F-15 COCKPIT (FLYING) - MORNING

The PILOT arming the weapons systems, finger moving to the
trigger...

PILOT
Dropping in 5, 4, 3...

He squints as he sees

A LITTLE GIRL on the White House lawn. Twirling, doing a
flag girl routine. Red, white, and blue fluttering in the
breeze.

PILOT (CONT'D)
Abort, abort, abort!
132.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

The F-15's break formation, screaming over the structure!
Weapons intact.

INT. PENTAGON - BUNKER COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

COLONEL JANOWITZ
We have negative impact, repeat, no
weapons released on target.

Raphelson opens his eyes.

RAPHELSON
What?

Janowitz listening to the phone, then:

COLONEL JANOWITZ
Sir, we are getting multiple reports
in now that the hostages have reached
the police barricades and are saying
that Castle has been retaken. I...
(pause; listens)
The White House is secure.

The entire room BURSTS INTO CHEERS! Hugs and tears!
Raphelson, stunned. Finnerty squeezes his hand. It's over.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - MORNING
Emily steps back into the wreckage of the Oval to find her

father propped up against the remains of the desk. He smiles
at her. She shrugs, a little self conscious.

EMILY
You wanted to see my flag twirling...
CALE
You were beautiful, baby. You saved
us.
EMILY

You came back for me.

CALE
Always.

She hugs him again. Coughing from the other side of the
room. They look. Sawyer, watching them. Smiling. Coughs.
133.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Did you drive a car through my office?

CALE
Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
We have doors, you know.

CALE
A lot more now.

The President laughs.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Gonna take awhile to fix this place

up.
EMILY

You can come stay with us.
CALE

(looking at her)

Us?
EMILY

Yeah.

He hugs her close. Outside on the lawn, various emergency
vehicles gather and choppers land.

CALE
Medic! We need a medic in here!

A MEDICAL TEAM rushes in. Cale and Emily step back as they
swarm the President. Tasking his vitals, starting an IV...

Cale takes an offered blanket and wraps it around Emily's
shoulders and they step out onto

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - MORNING

Fire helicopters hover, dousing the top two floors of the
White House with fire-retardent foam. Dozens of news choppers
circle. Marines set a perimeter around the building.

Cale and Emily walk through the fray, almost forgotten.
Until

FINNERTY (0.S.)
Cale!
134.

Cale turns to see Finnerty step off a helicopter. Their
eyes meet. So different than they were a few hours ago.
Smiling as she approaches.

For a moment they don't even know what to say. Then Finnerty
steps forward and hugs him. Places a small kiss on his cheek.

EMILY
So, does he have the job?

Finnerty looks over to the gurney carrying the President out
of the Oval, then smiles.

FINNERTY
That depends. Does he have any
references?

Behind her, Cale sees Raphelson step off a chopper. Flanked
by MILITARY AIDES, he marches grim faced towards the White
House.

CALE
What's going on?

FINNERTY
He could have turned back the air
strike and didn't. He's taking it
hard. And...

She hesitates.

CALE
And what?

FINNERTY
We just found out the fifty million
in Bishop's account came from an
Iranian cut-out. This was state
sponsored terrorism.

Cale watches Raphelson step through the ruined facade into
what's left of the Oval Office.

CALE
What's he going to do?

FINNERTY
Retaliate.
135.
INT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDORS - MORNING

Raphelson marches through the ruined halls. Stepping through
glass and debris, over fallen bodies.

RAPHELSON
Somebody clean those up.

Headed for...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Empty, now that the terrorists are gone. Raphelson steps
over Humphries body as he enters. Exhales.

RAPHELSON
God forgive us for what we are about
to do.

He looks to the NAVAL AIDE carrying the Nuclear Football.

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
Open it.

NAVAL AIDE
Sir?

RAPHELSON
Our country has been attacked by a
rogue nuclear state, I have discussed
it with my advisors and this is going
to be our course of response; my
Presidential Authorization Code is
9983452776301, now open the football.

The Naval Aide programs the code into the keypad lock. The
tumblers click. Opens. Inside the Nuclear Football, a
manilla envelope, a phone handset with a red light, and a
small thumb-pad.

NAVAL AIDE
Place your finger on the pad, sir.

Raphelson does. A pin-prick draws a drop of blood.
NAVAL AIDE (CONT'D)
DNA verification, shouldn't take
more than a few seconds.

The light on the handset turns green. The Naval Aide picks
up the phone and hands it to Raphelson.
136.

NAVAL AIDE (CONT'D)
This is a direct line to CentCom -
would you please read the target
package into the phone, sir?

The Aide opens the manilla folder for him and Raphelson reads.

RAPHELSON
This is the President. Target package
is as follows - the cities of Tehran,
Mashhad, Isfahan, and Tabriz.

From the football:

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Target package is confirmed, sir.
The release of nuclear weapons falls
under the two man rule - the Secretary
of Defense must confirm your orders
in order to launch.

RAPHELSON
The Secretary of Defense went down
on Air Force One. I am here with
the Assistant Secretary who was held
hostage in the White House. Mr.
Secretary?

He offers the phone to a SHORT BALDING MAN who looks
terrified. A beat. The Assistant Secretary takes it.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Mr. Secretary, do you confirm the
President's orders?

ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I do, sir.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Will you please read me your
corresponding launch codes
alphanumerically?

Raphelson cracks open a plastic laminated card - "The Biscuit"
which contains the launch codes. Reading.

RAPHELSON
Bravo Victor Tango Seven Niner Zulu
Charlie.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Mr. Secretary?
137.

ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bravo Victor Tango Seven Niner Zulu
Charlie. I concur, sir.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Mr. President, you are authorizing
the release of strategic thermonuclear
weapons on the country of Iran. Do
you so confirm these orders?

RAPHELSON
I do.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Missiles are being spun up. We will
need final launch confirmation in
two minutes-

six? CALE (0.S.)
ir?

This voice from the door. John Cale. Raphelson blinks.
RAPHELSON

John. Jesus. Ladies and Gentleman,
this is John Cale, the hero of the

day.

CALE
I need a moment alone with the
Speaker.

RAPHELSON

Can it wait?
(gestures to the
football)

We're a little busy here-

CALE
Bishop had help, sir. Someone on
the outside.

Raphelson looks at him.

RAPHELSON
Give us the room.

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(uncomfortable)
Sir-
138.

RAPHELSON
He's my Secret Service, for
Chrissakes.

Fair enough. The others file out. Leaving the two men alone.
Nuclear football on the table between them.

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
Emily okay?

Cale eyes the blinking football.

CALE
Nuclear holocaust in the Middle East?

RAPHELSON
You think it makes me happy? They
tried to destroy our country today.

CALE
Did they?

He slowly moves around the table.

CALE (CONT'D)
See the whole board, isn't that what
you told me?

On Raphelson. Doesn't like his tone.

RAPHELSON
John, I'm going to have to ask you
to come to the point-

CALE
How do you assassinate a President
without making it look like an
assassination?

Raphelson stares at him.

CALE (CONT'D)

You pay a man who's got nothing to
lose. You send in a team of
terrorists with ridiculous demands,
you shoot down Air Force One, you
make it about everything but
assassination, so when the smoke
clears, no one realizes that you've
cleared the line of succession and
ascended to throne.
139.
Raphelson has gone very still.

RAPHELSON
That's quite a story.

CALE
Do me a favor and don't deny it.

RAPHELSON
What about Iran?

CALE
You never wanted the Peace Accord.
You paid Bishop, you told him this
was about data-farming. You made it
look like the money came from Iran.
You framed him to get your war.

RAPHELSON
This war was coming no matter what.
This way we save 10 years in the
desert and thousands of American
lives. We end it with one shot.

CALE
You committed treason.

RAPHELSON
You think I hurt this country?

Raphelson picks up the TV remote and clicks it on. CNN shows
people gathering all over the country. Candlelight vigils.
People coming together, comforting one another.

RAPHELSON (CONT'D)
This unified them. One nation,
indivisible once more. United behind
a common goal. Today made us stronger
than ever.

CALE
Under you, right? Let me guess, the
President's going to mysteriously
succumb to his wounds at Bethesda.

RAPHELSON
You're looking at the President,
son.

CALE

You're under arrest.
140.

RAPHELSON
I don't think so.

The Football squawks:

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Sir, we need final codeword
conformation for launch.

Raphelson reaches for the handset. Cale draws his gun.

RAPHELSON
What are you gonna do? Shoot the
President? There are a thousand
Marines outside that door and no one
will believe you.

CALE
Why not?

RAPHELSON
Because you're nobody. Despite your
heroics today, in the end you're
just a shell shocked little shit and
I'm the President of the United
States!

PRESIDENT SAWYER (0.S.)
No, you're not.

Raphelson turns to see Finnerty wheeling a very much awake
Sawyer in a wheelchair. He looks at Cale in disbelief.

President Sawyer picks up the handset for the football.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
This is President Sawyer, cancel all
launch preparations and return us to
DEFCON 2.

CENTCOM COMMANDER (0.S.)
Roger that, sir.

RAPHELSON
But- but, you can't! I'm the
President now!

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Then consider this a coup de'tat.
Take him onto custody.
141.

Finnerty moves to him when Raphelson screams, pulling the
gun she gave him from his pocket, levelling it at the
President...

BLAM! Cale fires once. The bullet rips through Raphelson's
left thigh. He goes down screaming.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
Hurts, doesn't it?

The doors fly open as everyone else rushes in at the sound
of the shot. Sawyer nods to Raphelson.

PRESIDENT SAWYER (CONT'D)
Please place the Speaker of the House
under arrest.

RAPHELSON
(moaning)
I need a hospital...

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Prisons have hospitals, don't they?

FINNERTY
Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
All right, then. Take him away.
(to Cale)
And you. Isn't this your day off?

CALE
Yes, sir.

PRESIDENT SAWYER
Then what are you still doing here?
Go take your daughter to lunch.

Cale smiles.

CALE
Thank you, sir.

He turns to the door. We depart with him, leaving the
President giving orders, back in charge:

PRESIDENT SAWYER
General, get me the President of
Iran on the phone...
142.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MORNING

Cale and Finnerty step out through the ruined Oval Office
and walk across the wreckage strewn South Lawn with Emily.

FINNERTY
I've been thinking.
CALE
Yeah?
FINNERTY
You're the worst Secret Service Agent
ever.
CALE

How do you figure?

FINNERTY
The President was shot once in your
care, you just shot another President
in the leg, and although I can't
prove it conclusively, I'm pretty
sure you set fire to the White House.

CALE
Well when you say it all out loud
like that...
Finnerty laughs. The three of them walk on.
All of Washington DC laid out in front of them. Smoke rising,
but already a sense of community. People pulling together,
a city rebuilding. Emily grasps her father's hand.

EMILY
Let's go home.

We begin to pull up and back. The building behind them looks
different. Battered, missing some pieces.

But it's still the White House.

A pair of F-15s ROAR OVERHEAD, flying Combat Air Patrol over
Our Nation's Capital. Safe once more.
