OPEN ON:

SWISS CURRENCY. Hundred franc notes. Fifty bills spread
across an oil-stained mattress. Serial numbers visible.

TERRY (VO)
“,..a final ransom settlement of 750
thousand dollars in non-sequential,
unaltered Swiss currency..."

FLASH! ~~ a picture of the money and --

WE'RE IN

AN OLD STONE BARN. Some shitty upstairs room. Bitter cold.

WIND howling through plastic draped over a broken window.

Splayed ancient floorboards. A frozen toilet in the corner.

TERRY (YQ)
",,,this was a fourth-round number,
down from an initial demand of three
million..."

TERRY THORNE is alone in this room. He’s forty-three.
English. Working-class makes good in British Special
Forces. He’s no longer a soldier but the smell of it
will stay on him. forever.

There’s A SUITCASE packed with Swiss Francs at his feet.
Blankets, hung from the rafters, draped like a tent over a
rusted iron cot. There’s a camera inside. TERRY is trying
to photograph this money as quickly and discretely

as he can -- FLASH!

TERRY (VO)
“,,..this placed us within six percent
of our original target figure, a number
consistent and in-line with recent
ransom final figures in the West-Asian,
post-Soviet republics..."

He’s scrambling -- it’s cold -- he’s not had sleep, hot
water or a decent meal in days -- checking his watch -~
fuck -- he’s running out of time --

TERRY (V9)

"...given the actively dynamic field
conditions and fluid nature of our
transfer schedule, normal photographic
documentation of the payment package
was unfortunately limited...”
W

co

Qo

So it’s TERRY talking and we‘re watching TERRY, and there
ig some vague similarity between what he’s saying and what
we're seeing, Sut that’s as far as it goes. The voiceover
could hardly be more calm and dispassionate. What we’re
watching is anything but...

TERRY (VO)
",,..the transfer itself, was for

the most part, routine and without
incident..."

cuT TO

OUTSIDE. THE STONE BARN one of several crumbling structures
parked here in the bleakness. This used to be a village.

CHECHNYA

Post-Soviet grim. Frigid shades of gray. Evidence of war
all over. Shattered trees. A dead tank.

TERRY (YO)
",..reports of local Russian command’s
aifficulty in delivering consistent
field support had been independently
confirmed..."

RUSSIAN SOLDIERS waiting around a some vehicles. Hangovers.
Weary nasty faces. Worn-in weapons.

TERRY (YO)

"...given the delicacy of transfer
protocol and based upon real-time,
on-site observation, it was determined
that local military command had
strengths that lay elsewhere..."

A RUSSIAN COLONEL standing at an armored personnel carrier
watching TERRY haul the money suitcase from the barn.
His driver must speak English, because --

TERRY
(over the wind)
YOU -- TELL THE COLONEL -- TELL
HIM HE’S RESPONSIBLE NOW, RIGHT?
TELL HIM ~- HE FUCKS ABOUT, I’LL
BE THE LEAST OF HIS PROBLEMS!

Translation in progress as THE SUITCASE is tucked into a
lockbox beside a machine gun housing and --

cuT TO
TERRY watching THE RUSSIAN CONVOY pull away.

TERRY (VQ)
"...given the region’s historical
unpredictability and in light of the
assessments described above, it was
determined that Russian military
command’s exposure in the transfer
be minimized..."

THREE SCRAWNY RUSSIAN SOLDIERS left behind to guard the
barn. A VODKA BOTTLE already passing from hand to hand.

TERRY (VO)
",..to that end, a back channel of
communication had been established
with group holding Mr. Lenoir prior
to the final proof of life..."

cuT TO

THE STONE BARN’S REAR DOOR. TERRY ducking cut the back
with a canvas duffel. Jogging toward a stand of trees.
There‘’s A JEEP waiting. A NERVOUS LOCAL DRIVER and --

TERRY (YO)

"...as Russian escort proceeded

to the primary drop area, I was
directed to a secondary position..."

cur To

AN UGLY MOUNTAIN ROAD. THE RUSSIAN CONVOY has pulled to
a stop. THE COLONEL watching impatiently as two soldiers
snap open the lock box and pull out the suitcase --

TERRY (VO)
",..given the prevailing apprehension
regarding Russian command, it was
determined that I retain possession of
the ransom payment until a later date..."

THE SUITCASE ripped open. Surprise. Nothing but bricks.
cut TO

A HUGE DEAD FIELD. Frozen farmland. THREE CHECHEN TANKS
parked for protection. A couple JEEPS. A FLATBED TRUCK.
CHECHEN SOLDIERS ready for everything.

TERRY (VQ)
"...rendezvous was engaged at the
secondary location as agreed..."
 

TERRY'S JEEP parked two hundred yards away. He’s got
binoculars and a walkie-talkie. The airwaves aiive with
INCOMPREHENSIBLE RADIO CHATTER and --

TERRY (VO)

“,..with the exception of some
last minute negotiations over
landing air transport, the protocol
was fairly straightforward..."

A CHOPPER angling in over the field -- landing another
hundred yards off to one side. --

cuT TO

TERRY WITH THE DUFFEL. Walking out across the field.
Totally wide-open. It would be so easy to die right now.
The set-up just sucks. His body language is tough as

Mails, but as we get closer there’s no hiding the dread
in his eyes.

TERRY (VQ)
",..assuming local complexities
described above, and based upon our
prior negotiations, a simultaneous
transfer was deemed necessary..."

cuT TO

A CHECHEN FLATBED TRUCK. THE HOSTAGE -- MR. LENOIR --
kneeling there. Blindfolded. Two AK-47s up his ass.

He’s recently lost an ear and three fingers. Bandages
brown with blood. He’s dazed -- bruised -- freezing --

TERRY (VQ)
“...Mr. Lenoir, was found to be in
an excellent state of health given
the circumstances..."

cur TO

: THE DUFFEL BAG -- as it’s ripped open -- THREE CHECHEN

OFFICERS tearing through the money --

TERRY (VO)
"...following a review of the ransom
payment, Mr. Lenoir was released into
our care...

LENOIR kicked off the truck. Face first.
cuT TO
We

THE RUSSIAN CONVOY speeding back past THE STONE BARN and --

TERRY (VQ)
",..apparently Russian military
liaison was confused by the lack of
information available..."

cur TO

THE DEAD FIELD -~ faster and louder -- TERRY and LENOIR
making for THE CHOPPER -- LENOIR is weak and disoriented --

TERRY all but carrying him -- it’s going to.be a long two
hundred yards and -~-

_....., TERRY (YQ)
...initiating an effort to confirm
that a parallel process was indeed
underway..."

CHECHEN SOLDIERS getting a bad report over the radio --

TERRY (VO)
“...abandoning the primary site,
Russian command endeavored to
reach our secondary location.

THE CHOPPER PILOT starting to freak -- rotors idling --
watching them come -~ let’s go -~

TERRY (VQ)
",..unfortunately, the situational
demands made it impossible to properly
debrief our hosts..."

OUT OF NOWHERE -- AN ANTI-TANK WEAPON -- rocketing in from
the horizon -- some completely unanticipated angle --

TERRY (VO)
",...as a result, some local residual
confusion is to be expected in future...
WHAM! -- A CHECHEN TANK just wiped off the screen and -~-
THE RUSSIAN CONVOY coming hard from the distance and --
THE CHOPPER PILOT looking ready to bail and --
TERRY -- fifty yards to go -~ SCREAMING FOR HIM TO WAIT! -~

WEAPONS ripping through the wind and --

on
NY

TERRY’S JEEP -- THE LOCAL DRIVER -- stuck in the mud -- : !

panic making it worse -- just finding traction as TRACER !
ROUNDS tear into nim and --

THE TWO CHECHEN TANKS searching for targets -~

TERRY still coming -- waving a sidearm at THE CHOPPER PILOT
-- "don‘/t move!" -=- dragging LENOIR in under the rotors --

A RUSSIAN JEEP EXPLODING behind them and --

INSIDE THE CHOPPER -- total chaos -- LENOIR scrambling in
-- THE PILOT SCREAMING IN SLAVIC -- he’s. freaking out --
pulling up already -- toe soon because --

TERRY hasn‘t cleared the threshold -- tossed back -- head
Slammed against the door as he falls -- rocked -- grabbing
at the doorframe -- hanging there! -- nothing but instinct
keeping him from falling and --

THE GROUND pulling away and --

LENOIR reaching for TERRY -- trying -- but THE PILOT --
there’s something wrong -- something new -- no time --
suddenly he’s jerking the stick and --

THE CHOPPER spilling sharply to one side and --
TERRY falling -- falling inte the cockpit and --

WHOOOOOSK! -- AN ANTI-TANK ROCKET -- a blur -- already on
them -- already past -- they’ve been hit! -- creased --
A LANDING SKID torn away from the undercarriage! -- the
helicopter tilting -- overreacting -- stalling -- for a
moment it looks like they’re beating it in and --

THE PILOT fighting to keep it up -- CURSING AND SPUTTERING
IN SLOVAK -- LENOIR rolling on the floor in pain -~ his
bandaged hand crushed in the turbulence and --

FINALLY TO

TERRY pulling himself into a window seat. He’s dazed.
Leoking down as the earth begins to pull away. As the
chopper starts to level off.

TERRY wiping at the blood from a deep cut above his eye.
Wiping it away so he can see. Tying to get a grip.
To focus. Something.
TERRY (YO)
.--following our departure, we
were made =5 understand there nad
been some difficulty implementing
local exit strategies..."

TERRY watching it all get smailer. Emptiness more than
relief. Exhaustion more than triumpn. The shock of still
being alive. Wiping at the blood pouring down into his eye,
wiping at it one last time before he passes out, and we --

cut To

A CASE BOARD. A big presentation-style chart. Eighteen
international kidnapping cases listed here. Actually it’s
only seventeen because the Lenoir/Chechnya case has been
crossed out. Boxes after each name -- categories and info
-- date of abduction -- first demand -- target figure --
last proof of life -- Ecuador, Philippines, Kenya, Mexico,
Guatemala, Pakistan, Colombia --

TERRY (OS)
..Mr. Lenoir was examined by mobil
medical and transported to Athens
yesterday for surgical treatment...

WE/RE IN

A CONFERENCE ROOM. Spare, efficient decor. Hi-tech and
a little shabby. Corporate logo along one wall:

R x iA AL

A DOZEN PEOPLE -- ten men and two women ~- seated around

the table. TERRY wrapping up his report. Bandage above
his eye. Wound still fresh.

TERRY
---Given the region’s historical
instability, and the fluid nature
of this most recent project..."

HARRY LUTHAN at the head of the table. Company Director.
Slick suit. Slick everything. Beside him, IAN HAVERY,
K&R Chief of Operations. He’s sixty and clear-eyed.

TERRY
.-..it’s recommended that further
extractions be studied carefully
and that all appropriate insurance
representatives be made aware of
increased liability and costs.

 
He’s done. Barely a beat, before --

LUTHAN
Eastern bloc -=- wnat was the total
insurance billing last year?

HAVERY
Aggregate?
PAMELA at the table. Thirty. Beautiful. sri Lankan.

PAMELA
Thirty-eight million dollars.

LUTHAN
And what was the ransom total?

PAMELA

Covered on policies?
(checking fast)
...twenty-six million.

LUTHAN /

Jesus...

(to Havery)
I think we need a meeting with
the insurance carriers this week.
Wave the red flag a bit. Let them
know our costs are rising.

(almost forgot)
Excellent job, Terry. Thank you.
As always. Outstanding.

(files before him)
All right, where are we next?
We've got Pakistan, Colombia...

TERRY folding up his shit. HAVERY catching his eye.
Wait for me.

cuT TO -

A CABLE CAR. Nothing fancy. Steel pipe, wood planks and
corrugated tin. Construction site pragmatism and quality.
We're ascending slowly and steeply. Half a dozen yellow
hardhats visible inside as the car passes.

TELACCA
PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A JUNGLE RIVER GORGE. Steep canyon walls. Lush vegetation
wherever it can grab hold. Sweet, fast-moving water below.

PETER (0S)
-- no, no, wait -- no, you wait...
Keith, excuse me, but <nat is pure
Oklanoma horseshit --

cuT TO

THE CABLE CAR. Pulling to the summit. A patch of green
shaved away to make room for quonset huts, warehouses and a
couple mobile homes. Headquarters for a large construction
project still in the preliminary stages. A ubiquitous
corporate logo: GEM-CARBON

PETER (0S)

-~ because I’ve got sixty people
sitting up here in the damn jungle
with nothing to do! --

The doors open. PETER GEHRIG cut-onto a timber platform.
He‘’s maybe forty. Texan. He’s an engineer. Cowboy. boots.
Glasses. Dirty hands. And a satellite phone --

PETER
-- blasting canopies, blades,
gantry assemblies -- we’re supposed
to be building a dam here and I
don’t have a working dragline! --

Behind him now, FIVE ENGINEERS. Multinational crew.

PETER
-- oh, screw the pipeline! We’re
down here making you guys look good
and I can’t even get anybody to
return my damn calls!

A WORK GANG -- twenty local laborers -- parked in the shade.
Dead eyes tracking the boss as he paces around.

PETER

Well, what the hell am I supposed
to tell my people? What the hell
is going up there anyway?

(dead air)
Keith? Keith.

(connection gone)
Goddammit.

PETER looks around. Dead silence. Everyone here is

counting on him. And he knows shit. Just standing there
as the pressure washes over him, and we --

RISK MANAGEMENT LONDON. TERRY with his bag and briefcase
coming through the office. The place is busy. Desks and
phones and cubicles -- clearly global and urgent -~

PAMELA
Terry...
(coming after him)
Ian wants to see you.

TERRY
I’ll give him a call.

PAMELA
What about me?

He stops. She’s smiling.

TERRY
What happened to your City banker?

PAMELA
I’m bored.

cuT TO

A BIG OPEN-AIR MARKET. The outskirts of Telacca City.
It’s all here. Meat, fish, preduce, clothes, hardware.
Too many colors and sounds to catalog.

ALICE GEHRIG is lean and tan. She wears local sandals
and a Cartier tennis bracelet. She smiles easily. Her
Spanish sucks and she’s the only Anglo face we’ll see here,

but she’s at home in a market. Parisian mesh bags packed
with produce.

Two men stand at a sheet of plywood covered with dozens of
varieties of chile peppers. Call them ABBOTT and COSTELLO.
Under discussion, a handful of black goathorn peppers.

MARIA is Alice’s housekeeper. She’s forty-five. Stern and

_ protective. She’s doing the talking with these two clowns.

MARIA
He says is too much for you maybe.
(translating)
Too strong. He says this is most
powerful chile in Telacca.

ALICE
Does he eat it?

MARIA in quick repartee with ABBOTT --
(Note: There’s Spanish in this story. Anything in the
film meant *o be subtitled, will appear in parentheses.
Everything else will be either paraphrased, <ranslated
-- as in this scene -- or assumed to be understandable.

MARIA
He says yes. He eats this chile
but he is a man. A country man.
(rolling her eyes)
He is the King cf Chiles.

ALICE smiles. Picks a pepper from the cluster. Pops it
in her mouth. Like nothing.

ALICE
Why don’t you ask His Majesty if
he‘’d care to join me?

MARIA throwing down the gauntlet. Con gusto. COSTELLO is
already laughing, mocking cut his partner, as we --

Terry! Terry! Hang on then...

cuT TO

TELACCA NATIONALE COUNTRY CLUB BALLROOM. As splashy as
it sounds. A garish approximation of a fantasy American
sunbelt golf club. A local fiesta on tonight. THE BAND
is great. The food plentiful. Buffet tables dripping
with flowers and ice sculpture. Service up the ass.

. TWO HUNDRED GUESTS grouped at big round banquet tables.

Two-thirds are wealthy Telaccans -- business elites and
drug traffickers masquerading as business elites. A few
high-ranking uniforms; blue for cops, green for military.
Heavy on the cabbage and epaulets. The women deep with
cleavage and latina perfection. Mixed into this crowd are
the ex-pats. Europeans, Japanese, Americans, and --

PETER and ALICE alone at a table for twelve. Centerpiece

says: GEM-CARBON OTL. ALICE taste-testing several plates
ef food. PETER drinking.
ALICE
You gotta try these panitos.

PETER
I’m not hungry.

ALICE
You wanna dance?

PETER
I want to know what the hell is
going on.
(beat)
And nobody called?

ALICE
I was home all day.

Here comes IVY with a plate of food. She’s a forty-five-
year-old bottle-plonde Alabaman. Ex-pat lifer.

Ivy
Hey ya’ll.- Sorry we‘re late.

ALICE
Where is everyone?

Ivy

Nobody called you?

(to Peter)
Are you shitting me? Unreal.
Fellner, Buddy, their whole group
had to go to Houston this morning.
Some kinda powwow.

(back to Alice)
Peggy said if he was going, she
was going and then I guess all the
girls jumped on that.

(c/est la vie)
So I guess it’s just us...

PETER
Is Jerry here?

Ivy
He was behind me... Probably off
doing a comparative cleavage survey.
(whispering)
I mean, do these women get into it,
or what?

PETER
What kind of powwow?

But here comes JERRY juggling a couple Dewars and a plate.
/

JERRY
Hey, hey, hey...
(Ivy helping him
lighten nis load--;
Alice, you iook stunning tonight...
(sitting down
with Peter--)
Ivy tell you?

PETER
Houston.

JERRY
This morning. All of them.
Fellner chartered a plane.

PETER
So what’s in Houston?

JERRY
Money.

PETER

That doesn’t sound good.

JERRY
Only if they don’t come back with it.

in London and Telacca. We're following two stories here.
Things will fall into synch as events unfold.}

HAVERY

So you’re all right then? still
in one piece.

TERRY
I’m a little wound up.

HAVERY

Of course you are. It goes away.
You know that.

TERRY
What do you want, Ian?

HAVERY
Am I that transparent?

TERRY
No.. You always want something.

LATIN MUSIC rising beneath this, as we --

cut TO

THE CLUB BALLROOM. Night. FRED and GINGER dancing --
laughing off the cobwebs -- it’s been a while -- but they
are really good. The dance some local cousin to the tango.
Dreamy and sexy and demanding all at once and --

ALICE reaching over for PETER. Her hand on his shoulder.
He reaches back, his hand covering hers, but he and JERRY
too wrapped up in their own urgent whispering to stop --

PETER
How did it get so bad so fast?

JERRY
Where the hell have you been?

PETER
I’ve been trying to build a dam.

JERRY
You oughta pick your head up every
now and then. Take a look around.
FRED AND GINGER starting to sweat and --

FRED leading ALICE to the dance floor and she’s laughing

LONDON/COVENT GARDEN CAFE. Oay. HAVERY has persuaded
TERRY =o sit down over coffee.

HAVERY
We picked up call from Telacca.

TERRY
You‘re not asking me to go down
there, are you?

HAVERY
I think if you hear me out...

TERRY
(his luggage)
I just got off the bloody plane.

HAVERY
Listen to me, I_need five days.
You saw the board. I needn’t tell
you how busy we are at the moment.
You heard about Jenkins and Clyde?
(obviously not)

They‘ve just left us to go work at
Vanguard.

TERRY
Didn’t you poach Jenkins from
Vanguard last year?

HAVERY
That’s not the point.
| TERRY
Look, I’m not good right now.
HAVERY
You‘re tired. It’s the jet lag

talking.

(flat out now)
Terry, I need you down there.
I’1l have Jules in to take over
in five days.

(a smile now)
I want you to consider this your
first management assignment.
The first of many.

TERRY

It’s not the first time.

TERRY
That was sort of my point.

TELACCA/RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAY. Night. A JEEP pulling in.
The house one of several large, newish homes on this street.
Mountains in the distance. .This could be a moneyed suburb

outside Denver or Phoenix.
cuT TO

INSIDE THE JEEP. SANDRO at the wheel. Peter’s driver.
He’s fifty. Quiet and solid.

SANDRO
Mafnana?

_ PETER and ALICE in back. Just getting out.

PETER
No. Take the day. Call me Sunday.

ALICE
Night, Sandro...

SANDRO nods, watching them go, and --

coT TO

THE KITCHEN. The house is large and modern and well-built.-
The kitchen is huge and open. Glass all at the back to the
garden and pool. And scorpions -=- we’1l see them etched
into glass, tile, drawer pulls, carvings -- anywhere and
everywhere -- this design motif so runs through the entire
property we will know this location as The Scorpion House.

ALICE and PETER have just come in. They’re both a little
drunk. She’s loose and horny. He’s quietly flipping out.

ALICE
Any messages?

PETER
Zip.
She passes.

Runs ner hand down his back. He pulls away.

PETER
Nothing Like dancing with a drug
lord to get a girl revved up.

ALICE
He’s a lawyer.

PETER
Right.

ALICE
They play tennis. ‘s ir.

She’s rooting in a cupboard. Something falls to the floor.
PETER in that place where everything is irritating.

PETER
What are you doing?

ALICE
Trying to find Maria’s cigarettes.

PETER
I don’t know, maybe you missed
it, but this happens to be a very
big deal for me.

ALICE
I think I know that.
PETER
You sure don’t act like it.
ALICE
By having a cigarette...,
.
Forget it.
ALICE

How should I act?

PETER
I don’t know. Maybe like you
understand what’s at stake.

ALICE
So we can both be freaking out?

PETER
You tell me. This thing falls
apart then what was the point?
Lo

ALICE
The point of what?

PETER
Of what? How about Africa?
How about Thailand? How about
eight years of shit postings?

She‘s pouring herself a glass of wine.

ALICE
You forgot Egypt.

PETER
And you’re saying what? Just flush
the whole thing? Is that it?
Because this was the payoff, Alice.
My project. My people. My budget.
This was the one. And if it’s 0x0?
If Jerry’s right? They take this
over and = am fucked.

° ALICE
Who knows, maybe OXO wants a dam
of their own.

PETER
They don’t build dams. They kick
ass. They’d rather have a civil
war than a water system. You know
what they call it? What we do?

ALICE
(raising her glass)
Here’s to flushing Africa...

PETER
You‘/re drunk.

ALICE
Maybe it’s a sign that it’s time
to go home.

PETER

Oh, that’s great, Alice...

(disgusted)
This thing craps out and I’m back
at a drafting table and you know it.
I’m losing my brass ring -- I'm in
the middle of a total professional
meltdown and you think now? -- you
make this as a good time to start
back promoting this agenda?
J

ALICE :
Going home is not an agenda.

PETER

Your timing’s impeccable.

: ALICE

You don’t like this place either.
PETER

ALICE

I don’t have a project!

PETER
and that’s my fault?

ALICE
I’m not getting pregnant again in
the third world. You want to have
a family, we’re going home!

Married silence. Some line has been crossed.

PETER
Maybe you should go home. Take
a break. Even if the project’s
dead it’s gonna take a while to
close it down.
(she is staring)
That’s what you want, isn’t it?

ALICE
I never said that.

PETER
Then I guess it’s me.

And he walks. ALICE alone with it, as we --

HEATHROW AIRPORT. Duty Free. Who knows what time it is?
A consumer casino. A high-end assault of neon and display
cases. TERRY walking through like he’s done a thousand
times before. Buttoned down for travel, with the carry-on

Oh, shit...

HIS POV

IT’S A ROADBLOCK. Twenty cars stopped here. Up ahead,
at the checkpoint, police lights turning. There’s a dusty
embankment along one side of the road. The other slopes

down to the cane fields that stretch all the way to the
mountains.

BLUE UNIFORMS working the line, searching cars. Drivers
spreadeagle against their vehicles. Thirty, forty people
standing around. Lots of guns. Lots of tension and --

PETER trying to stay calm. You’re boxed in. You’re going
nowhere. Stay cool. Keep breathing. Checking his watch.

What I’d like to do is get a proper
file going. I have questions.
I’m sure you do as well. I’11 try

Good. We need some explaining.
Maybe somebody can tell us why
nobody from the police has even
bothered to come by, or take a
statement, or try and find witnesses
from this roadblock.

inspector before I came over, and

TERRY
...Kidnapping is a business in
Telacca. You need to accept that.
Thirty years ago the TAL was a
serious revolutionary movement.
Those days are long past. They got
fat running protection for the drug
cartels. They got fat and hungry
for more. One day they woke up and
realized kidnapping was a better
profit center than propaganda tool...

to do -- is find a number -- a dollar
amount -- that gets him back in one

TERRY
All you’re going to get from th
embassy is a smile and pat on the

now is to keep their heads down,
keep things quiet, and get the oil
flowing. You don’t fit into their

TERRY
Truth is I don’t know. Last year,
things were much more predictable.

She‘s pouring wine. Her hand is shaking.

ALICE

We were supposed to go home -- we

So we were all set to go home and

very competitive -- these projects.

people’s houses and tell them how
it is and...

Too many.

TERRY
This is a good place to be kidnapped.

ALICE
So these two Brazilians they
found dead last month. They were
hostages. What happened there?

TERRY blindsided. Hanging for a moment.

TERRY
First of all, one of them was
Venezuelan. Second, they were
arms dealers. They were doing a
gun deal when they were taken.
It’s a little different.

SCORPION HOUSE DRIVEWAY. Night. Later. TERRY Leaving.
Opening the door to his rental Jeep. Tossing in his stuff.
Hesitating. Turning back toward the house. Listening.
Looking around. Sightlines. Perimeters.

Music playing from across the street. TERRY moving now,
in the dark around the house. A strictly professional
security survey. Checking angles. The gate.

And then he stops.

There -- through the window -- ALICE alone in the kitchen.
Smoking one of Maria’s cigarettes. Unaware she’s being
watched.

TERRY just staring. Free to stare. Even in this much
pain she’s beautiful. Or is it because she’s in pain?

But it doesn’t matter, he’s frozen there.
Startled -- the spell broken -- as A DOG STARTS BARKING

across the street. And when he looks back, she’s gone,

THE BARTENDER lays out a Black Bush with a Coke back.

THE BARTENDER points down the bar. TWO GUYS waving.

ANGLE ON

THESE TWO GUYS as TERRY comes around to join them. DINO

An old hand at thirty-five. WYATT is English. Fifty and

they‘re both K&R consultants.

DINO

We've been waiting for you.

TERRY
Yeah, I’m doing one side at a time.
You’re good?

DINO
Looks like shit, but he’s working.

WYATT
Thank God, you’re here, Terry, <=he

Could I please? old time’s sake.
You know the routine.

TERRY
Who’s the hostage?

WYATT
Canadian fellow. Geologist.

TERRY

And you?

DINO
Come on, dude. Where you been?
I’m working the biggest thing
down here.

WYATT
He’s doing the Italian. Calitri.
The banker. He’s very pleased
with himself.

DINO
And Ian’s got you off in fucking
Chechnya. Astounding.

WYATT looking for another drink now as --

DINO
You heard about Clyde and Jenkins?

TERRY
(lying)
No. What happened?

DINO
They’re back working for us.
(amazed)
What is Ian doing? Keeping you
under a fucking rock? You gotta
get informed. I’m gonna open your
eyes while you’re down here.

TERRY
Better do it quick. I’m just
passing through.
DINO
I thought you had this Gem-Carbon
thing going.

TERRY.
No, I’m just in holding hands.
Just waiting for the cavairy.

ALICE and JANIS directly in the line of this bullshit.
Also present, JERRY, and SEVERAL OTHER GUYS IN SUITS.

JANIS
Why isn’t Mr. Thorne here?
JERRY
The guy from Risk Management?
ALICE
We thought that’s what this was
about.
FELLNER

There’s been a change in plans.

JANIS
What kind of change?
FELLNER
We think it’s best -~ for all of
us -- under the circumstances --
to go with a local representative.

JANIS
Not use Risk Management?
ALICE
What circumstances?
A heavy pause.
FELLNER
There’s no insurance.
(dead air)
. None of us -- no one at Gem-Carbon

has been insured for kidnapping
since last July.

Heavier still.

ALICE
How is that possible?

FELLNER
They stopped paying premiums.
Some idiot in New York was trying
to cut costs and didn’t know what
they were doing and...

JANIS
That’s crazy.

FELLNER
That’s one way to describe it.
(I feel your pain)
Alice, please. This could be any
one of us.

ALICE
But it’s not, is it? It’s Peter.

FELLNER
Look, OXO is buying the pipeline.
What we need to do -- what we’ve
been trying to do -- is make sure
they’re aware of these important
obligations.

ALICE
I bet they can’t wait for that.
(flame-on)
I’m sure they’re just standing-by
ready to jump in and help out.
JANIS
This is absurd.

Where’s Gem-Carbon in all this?

FELLNER
Gem-Carbon is evaporating. They’re
selling off what they can. It’s
just a little late for miracles.

JANIS

We need to speak with an attorney

ALICE
Janis.

(freezing her)
Don‘t.

(to Fellner)
So you’re all out of work?

FELLNER
It would seem so.

ALICE turning -- there’s a guy sitting in the back of the
_Foom. He’s Telaccan. Fifty. Well-fed. Cheap suit.

ALICE
And who’re you?

FELLNER
(quickly)
Alice, this is Arturo Fernandez...

MR. FERNANDEZ on his feet. Like a puppet. Most gracious.

FERNANDEZ
Mrs. Gehrig...

FELLNER

Mr. Fernandez has helped out with
our local security coordination for
years. He’s yery well connected.
Very experienced. I think if you
give us a couple minutes to talk

it over, you’re going to realize
just how lucky we are to have hin
working with us.

ALICE
I can’t wait.

INTERCON HOTEL LOBBY. Front desk. TERRY checking out.
DESK CLERK handing him his bill, and --

ALICE
Boy, did you have me fooled.

TERRY blindsided. There she is.

TERRY
I was about to call you.

ALICE
Where? From the plane?
(she’s just raw)
You stood in my house and told me
I didn’t have to worry anymore.
You_stood there.

TERRY
Look, we all thought Gem-cCarbon was
still a client. A claim gets called
in. It‘s the weekend...
(off-balance)
It’s not a perfect system.

ALICE
What about us? We can’t be the
client?
TERRY

It’s not that simple.

ALICE
You get ten thousand a week plus
expenses. We checked it out.
How do you know we can’t pay?

TERRY
Really, I am sorry, but this isn’t
a good situation for us either.

ALICE

Us?

(savage incredulity)
You. You stood in my kitchen and
told me my husband was coming home!

TERRY
Look, Gem-Carbon’s out, okay?
OxO spends forty million a year on
K&R insurance around the world.
My company has a nice piece of that
and the last thing OxO wants is a
conflict.

TERRY
That’s the point. That’s how they
want it. No confusion. No exposure.
No liability.
(beat)
I’m not even supposed to talk to you.

ALICE
So this is what? This is you being
brave?
TERRY
No. This is me doing my job.
(hot now)

Look, I’m really sorry, okay?
But I haven’t seen my own bed in
five months. I’m two minutes off
my last job, they’re telling me
to hustle down here and I come.
Now I wake up this morning and
the phone’s ringing and they’re
telling me it’s over.

(point blank)
I don’t make policy, okay?

ALICE

Well, it’s good I came by then,
right? Let you get that off your
chest.

TERRY
I’m sure it’s going to work out.

ALICE
They’re giving me some local guy.
They’re giving exactly the kind of
guy you warned me about.

TERRY
I don’t know what else to tell you.
It’s not my call.

ALICE
Great, so when this is over and
my husband’s dead and I’m suing the
shit out of these scumbags, you can
tell the judge you did everything
you could to help me out!

TERRY has taken his fill. He’s walking. She’s so stunned,
for a moment she iets him go. And the next she’s after hin.
Pursuing him through the lobby --

ALICE ‘
Wait. Wait. Please, just -- just
please -- you can’t go -- just
listen to me, all right?

(he’s trying to
tune her out--)

I’m sorry to be like this, but I
mean, my husband is somewhere, God
knows where and I haven’t slept
in days and I’m at war with two
international oil companies and
my sister-in-law and some terrorist
group I don’t even know, and you’re
the first -- you’re the only person
I’ve met who knows what they’re
talking about and I’m begging you
-- I'm totally fucking begging you
to help me on this -- I don’t care
about the rules or the liability or
being right or whatever it is --
and if it’s the money -- really --
we could pay. Peter’s father isn’t
poor --

TERRY stops. Near the door.

TERRY
You asked me not to bullshit you,
right?

ALICE
Right.

TERRY
I’ve got a plane to catch.

She is immobilized. Stunned. Standing there in shock as
TERRY walks briskly for the door and --

THE STREET. There’s a cab waiting. His bag’s in the trunk
but he’s not even checking. TERRY forcing himself to not
look back. Forcing himself to get in quick and close the

powerless to change it, as the car pulls away and we --

Angry about all of it.

Behind her, LINDA. Sixteen. She’s small. The AK-47
strapped over her poncho looks ridiculous. Indian blood
that can walk forever. Speaks a little English.

Then PETER. He’s been given a poncho and a backpack.
He’s exhausted and soaking and hungry and terrified.
But what do you do? You keep walking.

Finally, JUACO. The little maniac in charge.

They‘ve reached a clearing. The whole soaking caravan
slows to a stop. Up anead, there’s a break in the
greenery. Some sort of vista. They’re stopping here.
CARA and JUACO arguing about mule-packs being so wet.

PETER pushing ahead, up toward the trail break, where --
HE SEES

A VALLEY below them. Simply incredible. A volcanic basin.
Huge, stone peaks rim the horizon. The valley floor --
what we can see of it -- a thick carpet of green. The rain
clouds trapped above. Beautiful and terrifying.

BACK TO

THE PLATEAU. PETER near the ledge with LINDA. CARA and
JUACO arguing with increasing fury in the background --

PETER
Aqui. Esta? Por nosotros.

LINDA
Si. We stay here.

PETER
How long?

She doesn’t answer, turning back because the argument
behind them has stopped and JUACO is pulling a rifle from
the mule pack and he’s coming toward them -- toward the
ledge -- pulling the safety as he comes and --

PETER

JUACO raising the rifle -- PETER with no place to go --

PETER

JUACO waves the barrel in PETER’S FACE -- smiles -- and

then, BANG! BANG BANG! -- three shots -- right over his ear
-- into the sky -- off over the valley.

PETER on his knees. Shaking with fear. Ears ringing.
Is he crying or is it just the rain?

JUACO laughing at him. The two women standing silently
as the rain keeps falling. All of them waiting...

And then -- bang -- bang -- bang -- the response, three
muffled shots from the valley below, and we --

’ CAMP INSANITY. That’s what we‘ll call it. Three simple
huts pitched around a clear patch of mud. A tin shed hidden
back under the trees. There’s a stream fifty meters down a
little slope. Two cows. A couple chickens.

Two teenage boys, ALEX and BERTO have been roused from a
three-day party. They’re both wasted and fucked out.
Shirts off. Cigarettes going. Rifles slung carelessly.

PETER slogging in behind the mules. Trying to remember the
trail. But he’s exhausted. Which way did they come from?
Where’s the sun? Where is he now? Pulled back, as --

JUACO

(Where’s the fire? We‘ve been
walking two days and you can‘t
keep a fire for us! You lazy
faggot bitches! Go! Put down the
guns and make the fire!)

straw slapped over a rusted tin sheet.

LINDA moves aside. PETER at the door. Looking in.

PETER

LINDA
Si. You wait.
(pushing him in)
Wait here. You will have fire.

NORICIA
They’re calling back -- to this

ALICE taking the phone. Looking back to Janis, as we --

THE SCORPION HOUSE. Half hour later. MR. FERNANDEZ with
the cell phone. It’s a clipped, hushed conversation and
rapid-fire Spanish. He’s making notes.

ALICE with a cigarette. JANIS pacing. ELIODORO and
NORICIA on the couch. Everyone waiting.

FERNANDEZ
Si. Si comprendo.

Ire yo mismo si fuera neccesiario.

Si, adios.

It’s over. FERNANDEZ puts down the phone. Gathers his
notes. He’s wearing a sweatsuit. He turns to then.

FERNANDEZ
He says Peter is alive. He isa
prisoner of war. They want two
million dollars for his release.

FERNANDEZ
Obviously this is negotiable.

He says to make a better condition
for Peter’s food and care, okay?
And also for them to prove far us
that he’s alive -- they want to
make a first transfer -- like a
good faith -- as soon as possible.

ALICE
First transfer being what?

FERNANDEZ
(his notes)
Six hundred thousand pesos -- is
maybe fifty thousand dollars.

ALICE
Can we talk to him?
FERNANDEZ
This guy? On the phone?
ALICE
No. Peter.
FERNANDEZ

I don’t think so. I doubt this.
This guy, he’s going to make one
more contact, okay? He’s going
to tell us where to go for this.
(deat)

But, Peter is okay. And this --
it’s very fast for a case like
this. Very fast.

Nobody quite sure what to say for a moment.

Okay, I’m making breakfast.

Anybody hungry? Mr. Fernandez?

FERNANDEZ smiles. Sure. He’ll eat.

JUACO staring. Like a challenge. Fuck with me.

that we waive the normal forty day
holding period. Correct?

ALICE
Yes.

SANTOS nods. Proud. Bored. Angry. Not into gringos.

SANTOS
Who is this, C. H. Gehrig?

ALICE
That’s my father-in-law --

JANIS

bank in Galveston. In Texas.

SANTOS
You have a choice on this form,
two choices, these monies are for
investment purposes or for living
expenses. You have marked both...

We made a mistake. We crossed-off

TERRY
Nobody else was gonna take your

ALICE
I know, but you came back.

TERRY
And we’re gonna do this my way,
right? Even if it’s tough, right?
You‘re gonna trust me.

ALICE
I’m trying to thank you for being
here...

She’s overwhelmed -- she’s on her feet -~ she’s embracing
him -- she’s holding him and she’s weeping and TERRY doesn’t
know what to feel or think or do with his hands or any of
it, and there’s --

CAMP INSANITY. Day. The sun fighting its way through the
valley haze. PETER stripped to shorts and rubber boots is
hanging some wet clothes over a length of rope.

ALEX vaguely guarding him. Kicking a soccer ball. Smoking
a joint. All while juggling a loaded submachine gun.

BERTO and LINDA bathing down at the stream. Those insane-
looking mountains rising through the fog behind then.

And JUACO on the steps of the cooking shack. Smoking cheap
brown cocaine paste -- basuco -- from an old homemade pipe.
He is wasted. Sucking down a filthy bowlful, as --

THREE RIFLE SHOTS echo over the valley.

PETER -- all of them -- turning -- CARA rushing out of the
cooking shack and --

JUACO
(Give me the gun. Bring it!)
(weaving toward
Alex with his
hand out--)
(Give me the fucking gun!)

ALEX is reluctant but what can he do? Glancing at CARA as
he turns over the rifle. JUACO aims skyward unsteadily,
launching THREE ANSWERING SHOTS, and then -~-

ALEX wandering back to PETER. Waving for him to come on.
PETER quick grabbing his shit off the line.

JUACO weaving toward PETER with the rifle --

Juaco, por favor...

PETER has had it. Staring back daggers.

You know what I’d love?

Five minutes alone with you without

JUACO
(You don’t tell to me, okay!
I tell to you!)

PETER
I’d take your whole fucking world

PETER
You point that fucking. thing at

JUACO snaps -- the gun starts firing -- BAM! BAM! BAM!

ALEX has been hit. His foot. He’s just realizing it now

JUACO turns to her. She yanks the rifle from his hands.
And then she slaps him. Hard.

She doesn’t answer. In her hand, HIS SHIRT, the one that
caused all the problems. She throws it down. Closing the

PETER waits. Making sure she’s gone.

And then -- he’s got the shirt -- working at the collar.
Some secret thing tucked into the hem -- pulling it out --

Mules pulled into che deep shadows and --

PETER‘’S FACE pushed down into the dirt and --

HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS -- three of them -- blitzing in low

Dead silence.

ELIODORO

Tell him that the people he spoke
with before did not represent the

CANON VERDE. Tucked in the highlands, a small guerilla
encampment. A river cuts hard against a stone plateau
that frames one side. Behind us, the foothills of those
big volcanic mountains that form the cordillera. Jungle
cover across the bottomland hides the tarp sheds and out-
buildings tucked here and shere. There’s a peasant farm
terraced up to the West. The valley opens <o the South
where the clouds sit much of ‘he time.

Maybe that sounds pretty. Now add mud and shit and stray
@ogs. Add thick camp smoke that hangs over everything.
Add twenty or thirty teenaged soldiers.

THE CAMERA FINDS

THE PLATOON slogging into camp. PETER limping. He‘s
weak. The beard is heavy by now. But he’s still going.
Marching across a swampy open yard. Trying hard to take

(You stay here. There’s food
coming later. You understand?)

PETER nods. And a mildewed piece of canvas falls down
over the door. And now this is home. It’s small, but
dry. Crumbling adobe walls. A thatched roof. Straw
bedding scattered in the corner.

PETER pulls off his boots. Blood everywhere. His feet
are just ragged. And now that he’s sitting down, he can

But the door’s open now. Campfires burning in the yard.

You came today from the mountain.

I’m Kezler. Erich Kezler.

KEZLER is fifty. Looks older. Matted white beard.
Bad teeth. He’s a German missionary. Another hostage.

Peter. Peter Gehrig.

KEZLER
Kezler. You know this name?
Something perhaps. My situation.
(hopeful)
Some news, jah? Something.

PETER
No. I. don’t know...
(confused)
You‘re a hostage too?

KEZLER blinks away his disappointment.

KEZLER
There is an Italian at the farn.
Up the hill. He came a week ago.
He’s your friend?

PETER
No. No, I was taken alone.

KEZLER
He was sick. I hear them talk.

PETER
What kind of camp is this?

KEZLER
It was once for only drugs. To
make cocaine at the river. Now
from the fighting, it’s all the
soldiers. And us.

PETER
How long have you been here?

SOUNDS from outside. Too close. KEZLER with his hand up
for silence. He’s gonna have to go. Really quiet now --

You need soap for your feet.
Maybe tomorrow. We/ll see.

TERRY opens his desk drawer. A little tool kit.

You’d like him. He loves to eat.
He’s a big talker. Very sweet.
Very smart. I look at him, all

desk.

Peter’s face staring back. That picture of the

two of them on the tennis court.

Her emotions on the brink of calamity. Guilt and fear
and all the rest.

TERRY opens his eyes. Finds her there.

ALICE
You’re a gocd sleeper.
(a brave little
snile--)
I took a shower. I’ve been trying
not to wake you.

TERRY
The power’s back on?

ALICE
Yup.

Guilty silence. More than enough to go around.

TERRY
Are you okay?
ALICE
I don’t know. What happens now?
TERRY
I don’t know.
ALICE
You’ve never done this before?
TERRY
No.

Sort of the cardinal sin.

ALICE

So I guess we’re breaking al] the
Yules then, right?

can respond--)
I’m trying to think if we‘’d just
met. If it wasn’t like this.
If it was just, I don’t know...
She does.

Somewhere else.

ALICE

What would that’ve been like?
If I was just in my life and you
came through.

(absurd)
Like we could know that, right?

(put she needs

to talk--)
This is just so not like ny life,
that’s all. Nothing that’s
happened is like my life anymore.
So I’m a little lost here...
Maybe for you it’s not that
confusing. .I mean, this is your
life, right?

TERRY
Is that what you think?

ALICE

Neo. I don’t know.

(new quick to

correct that--)
And I don’t -=- I’m not saying,
oh, I’m so stressed out, or I was
drunk, or it was late or anything

off the hook. Because this was me.
I know that. You never would’ve
made a pass at me. I know that.
So obviously, I’m--

The idea was I could clarify things.
I know how that sounds with me
sitting here like this but...

What is it? Want something bad

TERRY
Alice, look at me.

ALICE
I think about Peter.

I can’t help it. Where is he
right now?

You’re not hurting Peter. That’s

She nods. Trying to get with that for a moment. Desperate
for solid ground.

.--for the meals, some nights we
could eat together. But the food,
it’s just to keep you alive. Just
rice or sardines. Maybe for weeks
the same thing. But Peter would
say, “Tonight, Alice has made for
us..." -= and he would have this
menu, from his memory, you know,
describe this feast that we were
eating. So many wonderful dinners
I’ve had at your table.

Bouillabaisse and lentil salad and
cold Muscadet...

TERRY
I don’t buy it. Work that hard on

DINO
When was your last radio contact?
A week ago? Two weeks ago?

Maybe there are no more deals.
Maybe it’s all coming apart.

TERRY
And maybe he’s alive.

DINO
Yeah, well, here’s what’s for
sure. My guy’s still up there.
And they don’t know Kezler made
it out. Nobody does. He knows
every inch of that camp and he’s
willing to help. This has gotta
stay quiet. She’s gotta know that.

You’re not thinking about going

Big news. Hanging there.

FELLNER
How could you know that?

ALICE pulls an envelope from her bag. Hands it to him.
He glances at it quickly --

FELLNER
Who the hell is Erich Kezler?

cur TO

THE HANGAR HQ. Empty and forlorn. TERRY messing with an
assault rifle. Stripping it. Checking it. Something
he’s done a million times before. ALICE sitting there
watching him. Listening to the metallic sounds. Seeing
a side of him she’s only imagined. Finally, He stops --

TERRY
What the hell’s he doing?
(checking his watch)
I’m giving him five more minutes.

ALICE
I’ve never seen you nervous.

TERRY
Yes you have. —

DINO

You _must‘ve done a helluva ob.

(there he is,

smiling in the

doorway-~)
I’ve just had an urgent phone call
from our friend Dover Mcloon at
the Embassy.

(bingo)
Is it true what he’s been hearing
about a rebel offensive?

TERRY
They bit?

DINO
It’s on. They tracked down Kezler
in Hamburg. He laid it on thick.
(backing out--)
I gotta call the boys. We gotta
get prepped -- like now -- like
three minutes...
DINO racing off. TERRY and ALICE alone again.

TERRY
Sandro can come and pick you up.

ALICE
I can take a cab.

TERRY
Don‘t.
(beat)
I don’t want to worry about that

too.
ALICE nods. This just awful silence. And then --
He reaches for her. And she’s there. Kissing her with
everything. Both of them. Losing themselves. The whole
world falling around them. Until...
He pulls away.

It’s time to go. A BELL STARTS RINGING -- a familiar
sound -- only GETTING LOUDER and LOUDER, as we --

brutal. We are in the presence of real battle-hardened

professionalism. We feel this in everything all of these
men do.

All five wear light tropical camo reinforced with Kevlar
flak vests. All five have light pro-tec helmets fitted
with radio earplugs and a wraparound micrephones. Each
man carries a one-day battle pack. Sidearms, automatics,
all the rest are personal choices.

It’s loud in here. There’s a map taped to the floor.
TERRY pointing out spots to RICO and TOMAS. DINO ripping

lengths of gaffer’s tape, reinforcing A BIG BLACK DISC
