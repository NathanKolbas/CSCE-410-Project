PROLOGUE - TOP CREDITS
FADE IN:

SMALL TV FRAME OVER BLACK SCREEN: at an air force base
somewhere, a newS REPORTER in short sleeves and ear phones,
holding a microphone, stands under the burning sun.

He is breathless, excited, on the verge of hyperventilating -
this is the biggest story of his young life!

REPORTER
Good morning. On this day, July
lst, 2014, at this hour - 0600 - 78
countries have begun...

ROOOAAAAR - a Military Jet takes off in b.g. Reporter holds
a hand to one ear over his ear phone and shouts to be heard:

REPORTER (CONT’D)
78 countries have begun to disperse
CW-7. CW-7 has been the subject of
much controversy as environmental
groups have protested its
development and deployment.

ROOOAAAAR - another jet takes off as Reporter takes up a
soccer ball size plastic MODEL in his hand.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
CW-7. This is a core molecular
model of CW-7. CW-7 is the answer
to global warming...it has been
claimed.

ROOOOOAAAR - this one goes right over Reporter's head - he
ducks as if the jet will hit him; scared and exhilarated.

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Today, as we speak and as you can
see - here and around the world...

CUT TO: IMAGE of military aircraft, against the sky,
dispersing CW-7, leaving streaks of white behind them.

REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
CW-7 is being deployed into the
upper layers of the atmosphere
where it will bring down average
global temperatures to the optimum
levels of the last century. And we
are witnessing it!

REPORTER grows ever more flush with giddy excitement over the
roughly shaking image with an explosive noise of a succession
of jets taking off...
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 2.

REPORTER (CONT’D)

We are witnessing the very, the
very, the very avalanche of a new
dawn. Today will forever be known
as the beginning of the end - the
end of our long crisis; the end of
our suffering and our fear; the end
of the, the, the tyranny of global
warming! Good bye global warming.

ROOOOOAAAAR - the image has become so shaky, we can barely
see the REPORTER as he drops the CW-7 model and shouts:

REPORTER (CONT’D)
This is the end!

MAIN TITLE: SNOWPIERCER / LE TRANSPERCENEIGE

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE OLD WORLD

THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS: a foggy, dreamy image of white takes
shape into a white blizzard that blows ever more violently.

An AFRICAN ELEPHANT walks with difficulty, staggering and
growing faint. As the strengthening storm covers it ina
blanket of white, the elephant falters. Its massive body
tumbles solemnly to the ground...

INT. TRAIN - SOMEWHERE
At the sound of a heavy clang, a GIRL's eyes pop open.
TITLE: 17 years later, A.D. 2031

In the heavy darkness, her two eyes blink soundlessly. Ina
cramped space, the girl's body undulates to a regular rhythm.

GIRL (V.O.)
From the day I was born, there has
always been this rattling. Because
I was born on a moving train.

Over the sound of a train's wheels RATTLING:

GIRL (V.O.)
I'm seventeen. The train has been
rattling for the past 17 years.
Outside the train, I hear the sound
of snowflakes falling onto the
frozen earth. No one is out there.
Everyone is inside, the Train...
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 3.

INT. TAIL SECTION - ENTRANCE

A massive, iron Gate fills the screen. A SOLDIER holding a
rifle, pulls a lever. The Gate slides open to reveal:

Endless freight cars, dark and filthy, like alleys in a poor
village. TAIL SECTION PASSENGERS, shabbily-dressed, looking
like vagrants, stand in cramped, packed rows of five across.

SOLDIER 1
Head check!

Passengers sound off their Numbers - “One” “Two” - and crouch
into a sitting position, each in turn, row after row, further
and further into the next car, like a cave...

Soldier 1 clicks furiously at the counter in his hand: 251-
252-253...

CURTIS (34) does not count and he does not sit. With a sharp
glare of concentration, Curtis remains stiffly upright as the
waves of obedient Passengers count and crouch. Curtis - a
lone standing figure.

SOLDIER 2
Sit down!

Curtis shows no concern. He stares past the iron Gate to the
gate beyond and the one beyond and the next...

SOLDIER 2 (CONT'D)
(aiming his gun)
I said sit down!

Curtis does not budge an inch. Passengers flinch in surprise
at the sight of the leveled gun inches from Curtis. His
fingers count on his thigh - 2-3-4 - as gates close one by
one.

EDGAR (20), anxious, sitting, pulls Curtis' pant leg.

EDGAR
Curtis - sit down. Sit down...

Curtis sits suddenly - ignoring Soldier 2 and his gun.

EDGAR (CONT'D)
What the fuck are you doing?

CURTIS
Counting.

EDGAR
Can’t you sit and count? You wanna
get shot? You’re crazy...

CURTIS
Shut up, Edgar. I’m thinking.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 4.

Passengers in the far-off last row finish their count.
Hundreds of Passengers crouch in neat, silent rows, their
heads bob gently up and down with the movements of the train.

SOLDIER 3 steps forward and lifts a megaphone:

SOLDIER 3
Are there any experienced
violinists here? Raise your hands!

PEOPLE

SOLDIER 3
Violinist!
(mimics playing a violin)
Violinist!

The Passengers just look around nervously at each other.

EDGAR
Violinists? Fuck that. Bastards
in the Front Section listening to
string quartets, getting massages,
eating fucking steaks...

CURTIS
We will be different, Edgar. When
we get there. When we get there.

EDGAR
(beat)
I want steak.

As the soldiers continue to shout, an elderly couple (GERALD
and DORIS) hesitantly raise their hands.

SOLDIER 3
Tell us your background.

GERALD
My wife and I played Violin in the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. I was
first chair...

SOLDIER 2 grabs Gerald’s hands - startling him. He examines
the hands.

SOLDIER 3
Can you still play?

GERALD
Of course. You never forget.

The soldiers mutter amongst themselves - “Boston?” - and,
after smirking, call out to Gerald.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 5.

SOLDIER 3
Follow me. Leave your belongings,
we just need your hands.

GERALD
Not both?

SOLDIER 3
Yes. Both hands.

GERALD
(taking DORIS’ hand)
My wife, Doris, plays
beautifully...

SOLDIER 3
They just need one person.

GERALD
Then I won't go.

SOLDIER 2
(approaching)
Who the hell do you think you are?

Soldier 2 pulls Gerald away from Doris. She shrieks and
clutches Soldier 2's arm who whacks her in the face with the
butt of his rifle. Bleeding, Doris falls and lies, unmoving,
on the floor. Gerald yells out. Passengers gasp!

In the grim, shocked silence, Soldier 2 brutally stomps on
Doris’ left hand with his military boot. DORIS screams.

GERALD
Dory!

SOLDIER 2
Now she can’t play anyway.

Edgar, temper flashing, stands up. Now it is Curtis' turn to
grab Edgar’s pant leg and pull him back down.

CURTIS
Sit down, Edgar.
EDGAR
They can’t...we can’t just...
CURTIS
(steely)

No. This isn’t the time.
Gerald struggles as he is dragged away by Soldiers 1 and 2.
GERALD

Dory! I'll come back for you...
I'll write to you!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 6.

Gerald is dragged through the iron Gate. He calms as soon as
he is through the gate - a small smile of hope and
expectation crosses his face. CLANK - the Gate shuts.

EDGAR
Fucking bastards...

Curtis stares at the gates opening as Gerald is dragged
through - he counts on his thigh as Edgar prattles - 1-2-3-
4...

EDGAR (CONT'D)
..-always treat us like this and
always we just sit here in rows...

CURTIS
Shut up. I’m trying to count.

EDGAR
We don’t count.

SOLDIERS push a cart, with large wheels, filled with pitch
black 'protein blocks' that look like chocolate bars. Ina
familiar procession, Passengers line up in front of the cart
and receive their protein blocks.

Doris, bleeding, holding her mangled hand, rises and moves to
take a protein block. With bloodied lips she eagerly gulps
it down...her flushed, swollen red cheeks twitching.

INT. TAIL SECTION - MIDDLE

Curtis moves past squatting Passengers chomping protein
blocks. One after another, Passengers shake their heads -

“No, not me” - as Curtis passes. Edgar hurries to catch up.
EDGAR
Curtis...
(stares at his protein
block)

What does steak look like? I was
real young when I got on the train.
I don’t remember it at all.

Curtis: “...”

EDGAR (CONT'D)
Is it square like this? I bet it’s
damn fucking good, right?

LATIN MAN suddenly stands and holds up his hand. Curtis
grabs Latin Man’s protein block and finds a hole on the side,
like on a block of cheese.

LATIN MAN
The hole!

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 7.

CURTIS
(Hands it back)
Not it.
EDGAR
Not it.

Curtis continues on, Edgar on his heels. TANYA, a large
African-American woman, jumps up and down and waves.

CURTIS
Tanya!

TANYA
Curtis! Look!

Tanya points at TIM, her five year old son who holds up his
protein block. Curtis moves to Tim, looking at the block
carefully. There is a deep hole at the bottom of the block.

CURTIS
Tim-bo - did you find it?

TIM
I did. I got it.
(Curtis reaches for it)
And I'm keeping it!

Tim takes off running. Curtis runs after him. Tanya runs
after Tim. Edgar runs after Tim.

TANYA
Tim!

Tim leads us on a merry chase through the Tail Section - a
slum crowded with multi-ethnic residents - giggling and
holding his protein block aloft, through the cubbyholes, hung
blankets, passageways, pipes...

Tim barely evades Curtis’ grasp as he darts away. Passengers
shout and yell as Tim knocks into them - they jump out of the
way of the rampaging Curtis, Edgar and Tanya in hot pursuit.

Edgar and Tanya corner Tim only to lose him when he climbs
the wall and swings from the pipes over their heads. Tim
drops and runs - he looks back and laughs and shouts...

TIM
It’s mine. All mine...

.+-and runs smack into Curtis, lying in wait.

CURTIS
Got ya!

Curtis snatches up the boy and lifts him in the air, and
tickles him. Tim screams in delight and wriggles like a fish
on a hook.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 8.

TIM
No! No, Curtis...

CURTIS
Gimme, gimme - come on, Tim-bo,
give it up...

Tanya, winded, arrives, huffing and puffing and laughing.
Only Edgar does not think this is funny.

EDGAR
Give it up, kid.

CURTIS
What will it take? What do you
want?

TIM
In the whole wide train?

CURTIS
In the whole wide train.

TIM
(face lighting up)
The ball!

CURTIS
The ball? Oh, no. Not that.

TIM
Yes. Yes. I get the ball for a
whole hour.

CURTIS
Done.

Tim ceremoniously hands Curtis the protein block. To Edgar:

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Edgar! Get Tim the ball.

Edgar rolls his eyes and walks away muttering.

EDGAR
What am I - your fucking slave?

Tim hurries after Edgar jumping up and down in excitement.
Curtis shouts after Edgar:

CURTIS
You're my trusted number two!

EDGAR
Number two. Great, you know what
that is - number two...?

Tim holds up two fingers.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 9.

TIM
It’s two. I’m four hundred and
thirty three. You know how long I
have to wait to get the ball if
I...

EDGAR
Shut up.

Curtis examines the protein block: at the bottom, a thin,
deep hole. Curtis nods, satisfied. He smiles.

CURTIS
Thanks, Tanya.
INT. TAIL SECTION - TENT AT THE REAR

A sharp knife cuts the protein block, slicing through the *
hole.

WIDER - Curtis cuts carefully and removes a small capsule
made of metal and opens it: a rolled up RED PAPER inside.
Curtis unrolls the Red Letter and reads the silver lettering.

GILLIAM (0.S.)
Red letter? *

ANGLE - GILLIAM (70's), sits against the back wall of the
train, wrapped entirely in rag-like clothes with only his

face protruding. *
CURTIS
Yes. According to our informant, *
he’s in the Prison Section now. *
GILLIAM
So his name is... *
(reading) *

N, A, M, K, U...

CURTIS

Nam Kung Min Soo.
GILLIAM

Strange name. Nam Koo Soo what?
CURTIS

We'll just call him Nam. Like

Vietnam.

The tent flap opens and Edgar appears. Through the open flap
we get a glimpse of Tim kicking a makeshift ball made of old *
rags tightly wound. *

EDGAR
(grabbing the Red Letter)
What’s it say?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 10.

CURTIS
(grabbing it back)
Edgar!

Curtis takes the Red Letter to a metal wall where dozens of
others are posted. He puts the new one in the final
position.

EDGAR
(reading over Curtis’
shoulder)
The hell... he’s in prison?
CURTIS
Shut up.
EDGAR

If he’s such a great security
expert why can’t he just break
himself...?

CURTIS
(sharp)
Edgar!

Curtis motions with his head for Edgar to leave. EDGAR opens
his mouth to speak but CURTIS’ look is steely. EDGAR turns a
pleading face to GILLIAM.

GILLIAM
Out.

Edgar, pissed, hurt, reluctantly leaves the tent - he gets
struck in the head by the ball as he exits. The flap closes.

EDGAR (0.S.)
Tim!

Tim speeds off as Edgar gives chase, their clamoring quickly
subsiding.

CURTIS
(bitterly)
I’m sorry. He’s an idiot. But
he’s our idiot.

GILLIAM
Young. These train babies.

Again, calm silence hangs between them. Curtis takes a deep
breath then puts protein blocks onto a small table to
represent train cars:

CURTIS
OK. We’re here, Tail Section,
Quarantine section, Prison Section.
Gate, gate, gate.

(MORE )

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 11.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
According to what I saw today,
there were 4 seconds when all three
gates were open at the same time.
We have four seconds to go through
three gates and we'll be in the
Prison Section to get Nam out.

GILLIAM
Our fate depends on this Nam guy?

CURTIS
That’s right.
(draws in a deep breath)
If we can get him to cooperate, we
can seize control right up to the
front of the train.

GILLIAM
To the very front section...

CURTIS
Yes. Everything in one stroke. We
liberate the whole train. We
control the engine, we control the
world. If we don’t, we get
nothing. Past revolutions all
failed because they failed to take
the engine.

GILLIAM
So... what are you saying?

CURTIS
This time, we take the engine.

GILLIAM
Then what...?

CURTIS
(in a low voice)
We waste him.

A heavy silence falls between Curtis and Gilliam. They look
at each other calmly.

GILLIAM
«+. Wilford?

Curtis nods.
train floor:

CURTIS' POV:

Gilliam's gaze fixes on a metal plate on the
Property of Wilford Enterprises.

carved in relief on an impressive iron metal

plate on the wall: Wilford Enterprises

CURTIS

You should govern the train now,
not Wilford.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 12.

GILLIAM
I’m a shrunken old man. My day was
decades ago...

INT. TAIL SECTION

ANGLE: On Curtis’ face deep in thought, as he lies
uncomfortably in a cramped sleeping quarter, constructed out
of wooden freight boxes. Edgar lies right below him wide
awake, looking up at Curtis.

EDGAR
Sleeping?

CURTIS
...yeah...

EDGAR

Good night then...

CURTIS

Edgar's eyes stay on the compartment above. All of a sudden,
they hear the sound of a couple breathing heavily, then the
moaning sounds get louder...

EDGAR
...-thinking about Alice, aren’t
you?
CURTIS
No.
EDGAR
Bullshit.
CURTIS

(sighs) Edgar...

EDGAR
I guess it’s possible you don’t
remember her so well anymore. It’s

been what... 4 years since they
dragged her off? She was one fine
lady.

The ever more agitated movements of the couple cause the
boards to creak. Suddenly, scores of strange bugs crawl out
from the boards.

CURTIS
What would it be like?

EDGAR
Damn fucking good.

He HHH OK

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 13.

CURTIS
No. I mean the baby. What if nine
months later, the baby is born...
and the first thing he sees is
this... this place. How would he
feel?

Curtis squashes a bug. Splat.

EDGAR
.-.cold.

Edgar pulls a dirty rag up to his neck and lets out an icy
breath.

CURTIS
That baby is going to grow up
eating tasty soup and potatoes,
steak too, in a clean, warm room at
the front of the train. And he
will go to school.

EDGAR
School? What was that again?

The ear-splitting sound of clanking metal! Curtis, with
lightening speed, pokes his head into the hallway.

A SHORT SPOTTER runs the hall clanking a metal pan loudly
with a stick. Here and there, anxious heads look out from
their cubbyholes to check out the commotion.

CURTIS
Shit!

INT. TAIL SECTION - ENTRANCE

FLASHING RED LIGHTS signal an inspection. Curtis and Edgar
run full out toward the Tail Section Entrance, jumping over
people as they go.

At the entrance area, where the protein blocks are rationed
out, Soldiers shove Passengers into line. Curtis pretends to
join the rows while he keeps his eyes on the Gate.

CLOSE-UP of a woman's high heels as she walks through the
sliding gate. The camera moves up and we see CLAUDE (early
30's), pale face and bobbed hair. Behind, following
OFFICERS, SOLDIERS and armed POLICE.

FUYU, a Japanese Officer, carrying an enormous Atlas and a
briefcase, stands just behind Claude’s right shoulder.

FUYU
Quiet, everyone!

+H HK

*

He HHH OK *

 %
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 14.

Fuyu gives a signal and the Soldiers seize children at
random. Parents scream and clutch onto their children, but
they are ripped away. Several dozen children are lined up in
front of Claude: CHAN, a Chinese boy, a white toddler...

SNAP - Claude snaps her fingers and Fuyu unsnaps and opens
the briefcase. Claude pulls a tape measure from the case
without acknowledging Fuyu.

Claude steps forward and precisely, wordlessly, quickly
measures the children. Each time she finishes measuring a
child, the tape retracts with a loud “THWAK!” before she
pulls it out again.

Parents cry. Curtis is angry - but he puts a restraining
hand on Edgar’s arm to keep him in check.

Claude measures the arm of ANDY, six years old. His father,
ANDREW, cringes in fear and shouts...

ANDREW
No!

Claude's piercing, fierce look shuts him up. Claude looks at
the children - displeased. Then her eye catches something on
the periphery: in the front row stands Tanya. A round shape
bulges from her skirt.

CLACK CLACK - Claude walks straight to Tanya, right up to her
face. They stare at each other, the dark Tanya and the snow-
white Claude. Curtis stands a few rows behind, observing.

Claude pulls out the tape and uses it as a pointer - she
gently lifts the skirt with it. Tanya looks down nervously
to reveal: the makeshift ball.

Claude glances at Tanya before she lets go of her skirt and
turns to walk away. Tanya breathes a quiet sigh of relief.
Instantly, Claude signals to Fuyu. Two Soldiers run to Tanya
on Fuyu’s order.

TANYA
(tapping her skirt)
Run, Timmy!

Tim guns out from under Tanya’s skirt and runs to the end of
the train. Tanya blocks Soldier 1 but misses Soldier 2
rushing after Tim. Tanya and Soldier 1 wrestle as nearby
Passengers also get tangled up in the scuffle.

AHHHH! A scream breaks out as Soldier 2 drags Tim forward.

TANYA (CONT'D)
NO!!! TIM!!!

Tanya’s eyes go wide in fear but she is paralyzed. Curtis
tenses as Tim is dragged to Claude who quickly measures him.

CLAUDE
(points with her tape)
These two.

Tim and Andy are dragged off by the departing Soldiers.
Claude turns heel to follow. Tanya breaks her paralysis and,
in a wild frenzy, breaks through the line of shields with
Herculean strength. She chases after her son.

TANYA
Timmy! Mommy’s coming...

Combat Police surround her and begin to club her mercilessly.

CURTIS
NO!!!

DANCING CLUBS fill the screen - Tanya lies on the floor, cut
down like firewood. While Police focus on Tanya, Andrew
breaks through the line like an arrow. Taken by surprise,
the Police stare dumbly at him for a second.

ANDREW
(throwing his shoe)
Give me back my son, you fucking
bitch!!

Claude, at the Gate, turns back to the insulting voice as the
old shoe sails through the air and the heel smacks her
directly in the forehead. Her steely expression does not
change. Fuyu cries out in shock.

Soldiers grab Andrew and throw him to the ground. Soldiers’
boots kick and kick and kick the bloodied Andrew.

Claude touches a pinky to the trickle of blood on her
forehead. She looks at it, sucks the blood off and clicks
away on her heels.

Curtis' mouth hangs open in a shocked stupor. His eyes
narrow as he watches the back of the departing Claude.

INT. TAIL SECTION - PORTHOLE

Andrew, bruised and bleeding, kneels with his old shoe in his
mouth. He looks ridiculous. And weak.

Soldiers, armed Policemen and high-ranking Officers surround
Andrew to watch two gigantic men snip off his shirt with
scissors. They are - the FRANCO BROTHERS - that appear to be
a strange, well-oiled machine.

The Franco Brothers work on Andrew like a couple of butchers
dressing a dead cow, greasing his arm with a blue liquid gel.

Fuyu consults his thick “Atlas:” maps show the intertwining
rail lines. He speaks to himself.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 16.

FUYU
.--Longitude 10 degrees 45...

Fuyu closes his Atlas with a smack and writes calculations as
the Franco Brothers place a METAL RING around Andrew’s arm
just below his armpit. On the wall, above Andrew’s kneeling
form, is an identical metal ring.

FUYU (CONT'D)
At this high elevation, we need
only 7 minutes.

Tail Section passengers grimace in anger, pain and sympathy.
A few turn around to regard Curtis whose face also registers
pain and rage. Gilliam is glimpsed behind him.

Fuyu suffers a pang of remorse looking at Andrew, before
putting a hefty clock on Andrew’s neck. It’s a timer clock
being used for measuring cooking time. He pushes the button
to activate the clock.

Fuyu turns around and bows politely to a well-dressed, well-
groomed middle-aged man who comes forward. He is MINISTER
MASON who appears rather mild and cultured.

FUYU (CONT'D)
Seven minutes allotted for your
speech, sir.

Mason nods and picks up a wireless microphone, standing in
front of Andrew, whose face is distorted in great pain.

MASON
This is so disappointing.

Behind Mason, Fuyu and a FEMALE OFFICER repeat his statement.

FUYU
(in Japanese)
This is so disappointing.

FEMALE OFFICER
(in Spanish)
This is so disappointing.

FUYU
(in French)
This is so disappointing.

FEMALE OFFICER
(in Chinese)
This is so disappoint...

MASON
Cut that out - I only have seven
minutes.
(he lifts the shoe)
Passengers, this is not a shoe.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 17.

FUYU
(sullenly silent)

MASON
This is disorder. This is size ten
chaos. This - see this - this is
death.

No one pays attention to Mason, all are focused on Andrew’s
agony.

MASON (CONT’D)

In this locomotive we call home, we

have but one barrier between our

warm hearts and the bitter cold.
(waves the shoe)

Clothing? Shields? No! Order!

INSERT - the train races down the dark mountain side.
Andrew's arm exposed outside the train freezes in a raging
snowstorm.

MASON (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Order is the barrier that holds

back the frozen death. Order. We -
all of us Passengers on the Train

of Life - must remain in our
allotted stations.

ON MASON:

MASON (CONT'D)
We must each of us occupy...
(waves his hand in a
peculiar motion)
...our par-tic-u-lar, pre-ordained
position!

Mason places Andrew’s shoe on his head.

MASON (CONT’D)

Would you wear a shoe on your head?
Of course you would not wear a shoe
on your head.

The Tail Section PAINTER flips to a blank sheet in his
sketchbook and draws.

MASON (0.S.) (CONT’D)

A shoe does not belong on your
head. A shoe belongs on your foot.
A hat belongs on a head. I ama
hat and you are a shoe. I belong
on the head - you belong on the
foot. Yes? So it is.

ON ANDREW in agony. MASON checks the ticking clock. He is
warming to his task - his speech growing more florid:
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 18.

MASON (CONT’D)
Why am I a hat, you ask? What
prescribes order, you ask?

ANDREW
Aahhh!!!

MASON (CONT’D)

In the beginning, order was
prescribed by your ticket. First
class, economy, you get my drift.
Eternal order is prescribed by the
Sacred Engine. All life flows from
the Sacred Engine and all things in
their place, all Passengers in
their Section, all water flowing,
all heat rising pays homage to the
Sacred Engine...

MASON (CONT’D)
...in its own par-ti-cu-lar pre-
ordained position. Yes? So it is.

ON CLOCK ticking. ON DRAWING in Painter’s hand - Minister
Mason with a shoe on his head. Mason, intoxicated with his
own speech, gets louder with excitement...

MASON (CONT’D)

Now, as in the beginning, I belong
to the front, you belong to the
tail. When the FOOT seeks the
place of the HEAD, a sacred line is
crossed. Know your place! Keep
your place! Be a shoe!

Mason dramatically finishes - he expects applause but does
not get it. He checks the clock - oops...

MASON (CONT’D)

Mmmm... We have some time left.
Let us go to a special comment from
Mr. Wilford, the Divine Keeper of
the Sacred Engine...

Fuyu gives an order to the Soldier at the back who turns on a
speaker-type device - but its crackling noise fills the
train.

MASON (CONT'D)
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

SPEAKER
BZZ2Z2Z22Z....CRACKLE...BZ2ZZ

Curtis looks at the Speaker with curiosity.

MASON
He’s busy. So it is!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 19.

DING - clock chimes, indicating that seven minutes have
passed. Franco the Younger unfastens the metal ring and pulls
in Andrew’s arm.

Andrew screams with pain and stares at his arm: frozen solid
from metal ring to fingertips. Franco the Elder taps the arm
with a spoon. It produces a clear sound, like ice. He nods
to Mason who raises his arm straight up.

Andrew's frozen arm is laid on a chair. Franco the Younger
holds up a huge hammer.

All eyes - awash with fear and rage - focus on Mason’s raised
arm. The front row men, the Tail Section’s ‘Army,’ look to
Curtis for the word to attack. Edgar shows Curtis a sharp
blade he has hidden. He whispers:

EDGAR

Are we just going to watch?
CURTIS

Not now.
EDGAR

(furious whisper)
Not now? Why not now!?

CURTIS
Timing is everything.

Edgar seethes. Curtis looks at Andrew in fear and agony.
Curtis closes his eyes.

Mason drops his arm. Franco the Younger’s hammer swooshes
through the air and crashes down on Andrew’s arm, which
breaks apart with a sickening noise of something hard yet
squishy. Fuyu cringes and looks away.

Gilliam stands up, letting his rags drop. His entire body is
revealed for the first time. He has one arm and one leg
each. But he has no trouble balancing himself.

A lean, muscular YOUNG MAN gently squeezes a crutch
underneath Gilliam’s armpit.

Gilliam walks out towards Mason. Like the subjects of an
elderly king, the Tail Section Passengers noiselessly move to
open a path for Gilliam. The Young Man stays on Gilliam’s
heels - his eyes darting about to locate danger.

Other Passengers follow behind Gilliam, each of them missing
an arm or a leg. Soldier 1 suddenly points his gun at
Gilliam.

SOLDIER 1
What are you doing? Sit down!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 20.

Gilliam walks forward as if not hearing him. The Young Man
positions himself between the GUN and Gilliam. Mason puts
his hand up to Soldier 1.

MASON
Lower that useless gun, stupid.
(to Gilliam)
It’s a pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Gilliam.

GILLIAM
MASON
You look healthy.

Ignoring Mason, Gilliam walks to Andrew, unconscious, propped
up by the Franco Brothers. He touches Andrew’s face gently.

MASON (CONT’D)
Release him.

Andrew is released and collapses. Gilliam catches and
supports Andrew and passes him off to the Passengers missing
limbs, who bear him away.

GILLIAM
Minister Mason. Please deliver a
message to Mr. Wilford.

MASON
Of course. What shall I...?

GILLIAM
Tell him, he and I need to talk.

Mason is taken aback and cannot come up with a response.

MASON
(chuckles )
Well... you can talk to me. Mr.
Wilford has no reason to visit

here...

Gilliam moves away, not listening to Mason.

CURTIS
(to himself)
Not here... at the front.

Curtis, standing in the middle of the row and eyes glittering
coldly, stares at Mason who huffs and moves away. Music
starts like a low heart beat. A montage sequence commences.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 21.

INT. TAIL SECTION - SOMEWHERE

SCRAPE - SCRAPE - the sound of heavy iron scraping against a
metal floor is heard. One by one, men remove sections of the
pitch black sewer pipes left in the old freight box...

RUMBLE - RUMBLE - the sewer pipes are rolled forward.

INT. TAIL SECTION - ELSEWHERE

A MARRIED COUPLE lifts the wooden board that serves as their
table to reveal a base of sewer pipes standing on their
sides. A HEAVYSET MAN from the Army hoists up the pipes.

INT. TAIL SECTION - OLD THAI MAN’S DWELLING

Sewer pipes are neatly stacked for use as a display case. In
each round hole can be found crude household utensils. OLD
THAI MAN waves his walking stick at Edgar.

OLD MAN
(in Thai)
You can't have this! You rude
ingrates!

EDGAR
Thanks for your cooperation! We
really appreciate it.

Edgar signals the Army to carry off the sewer pipes. Hitting
the men's backs haphazardly with his walking stick, the Old
Man continues to shout in Thai.

INT. TAIL SECTION - MIDDLE

RUMBLE - RUMBLE - A group of BURLY MEN roll a line of sewer
pipes forward creating a heavy roar, making the whole Tail
Section reverberate. Edgar, counting, doesn't see a pipe
rolling towards his foot...

EDGAR
Thirty one, thirty two...
(after a shocked pause)
AAAAAAAHHHHHH! !

INT. TAIL SECTION - DARK PLACE

Curtis, in dim light, steps over a pipe to join a BLACK MAN
and ARABIC MAN trying to screw one sewer pipe into another.

CURTIS
Turn it around - you have it
backwards.
14

15

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 22.

The men lift the pipe to turn it around - Curtis dodges out
of the way of a small object whizzing by his head.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey!

Curtis looks into the shadows - DARK FIGURES scurry away into
the shadows and hide.

DARK VOICE (0.S.)
You're going to get us killed.

Curtis peers into shadows - a blinking, broken light flashes
to reveal several big, greasy barrels marked: “Danger -
Industrial Waste - Flammable - CHRONOLE.”

DARK VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
You’re no Gilliam...

CURTIS
You want to live in this filth for
the rest...?

DARK VOICE 2 (0.S.)
Better that than die for your
stupid scheme...

Curtis takes a protein block out of a cloth bag tied to his

belt. He holds it up and the Dark Voices go silent. In the
darkness, their eyes blink with longing. Curtis throws the

protein block and Dark Figures shriek and run after it.

We see now they are near naked, emaciated men streaked black
with filth. In a corner, they fight over the protein bock.

Curtis reaches into a Chronole barrel and scoops out a
handful of small lumps. He places them in the cloth bag and
ties it to his belt.

INT. TAIL SECTION - MIDDLE

Music and heavy booming sounds echo through the Tail Section
as the Army assembles the pipes in a row. At 80cm (2 1/2
feet) wide, the lengthening shaft becomes a giant battering
ram.

INT. TAIL SECTION - ENTRANCE
ANGLE - WE FLOAT along with the gun held by Soldier 1. The
focus moves from the gun’s magazine to close-ups of Curtis

and Gilliam.

Curtis' POV: Soldier 1 moves farther away beyond the steel
gate.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 23.
CURTIS
(quietly) *
They don’t have any bullets.
GILLIAM
Why do you say that?
CURTIS
Did you hear Mason? He said - put
down that “useless” gun.
GILLIAM
He meant he would not give the
order to shoot me.
CURTIS
No - I think the guns are literally
useless. They used up all their *
bullets four years ago, in the last *
revolt. Bullets are extinct. *
GILLIAM
If you're wrong, we could be *
finished before we start. *
CURTIS *
It’s a revolution. We have to be *
willing to pay the price. I'll die *
first if I have to. *
INT. TAIL SECTION - VARIOUS
STEADICAM SHOT: On the walls of this dwelling are countless *

drawings like illustrations in a history book:

People Climbing Aboard the Train; Stampede of Passengers;
Hungry Vacant Eyes; Gilliam Speaking to the Passengers...

Painter flips through old sketch pads. He finds what he is
looking for, jumps up and heads out through the crowd,
clutching the sketchbook, ignoring the loud conversations of

the milling crowds.

The Army grapples with leather straps tied to the gigantic

sewer pipe, rhythmically trying to lift it.

EDGAR
One, two, one, two...

PAINTER
(mumbling as he passes)
One, two, one, two...

Painter turns and approaches a small cargo box, marked with a

red cross.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 24.

Painter enters an impromptu hospital: a couple of bunk-beds,
make-shift medical tools and medicines are visible. Andrew,
now one-armed, lies on a lower bunk.

ANDREW *
Andy! *
PAINTER
This... *

(opening the sketchbook)
Is this your...son?

Andrew's eyes open wide. He takes the picture in his
remaining hand. NURSES also look at the picture with
interest - a portrait of Andy. *

PAINTER (CONT’D)

The picture’s no good, I... *
(mumbling) *

It’s just...something to make you

feel better...

Tanya’s huge head suddenly enters the frame, suspended upside
down. Tanya, eyes swollen and bruised, drops from the upper
bunk to the ground with a loud boom, like a grizzly bear.

TANYA
How about MY son? Do you have one
of Timmy?

Before Painter can respond, Tanya snatches the sketchbook and
frantically flips through looking for Tim. She finds it!

TANYA (CONT'D)
Timmy! My boy, my baby.

Tanya’s face contorts with sorrow and despair. She rips the
page with her son’s portrait out of the book.

PAINTER
Ah! Gentle! Tanya...

But Tanya is gone - the sketchbook dropped to the floor.

STEADICAM tracks Tanya’s bulldozing walk. She talks to the *
drawing:

TANYA
Look at your silly smile - I know
that look - you just got caught
doin’ something you’re not supposed
to do, didn’t you? Oh baby...Mommy
forgives you.

She passes through the Army and approaches Curtis. She
places Tim’s portrait in Curtis' face with a look of appeal.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 25.

CURTIS
No Tanya, I’m sorry.

TANYA
Oh, yes I am, Curtis, or you will
be sorry. I am going to the front
and make that bitch sorry she ever
set her hands on my baby.

Curtis shakes his head but Tanya is determined - she points
at the Army.

TANYA (CONT'D)
You know I’m stronger than all your
skinny ass soldiers put together.

Curtis looks at Tanya for a while then sighs with
resignation. He holds Tanya’s hand and walks to the front.
Curtis replaces a big man at the front of the sewer pipe with
Tanya. She grabs the grip and joins:

ARMY
One, two, one, two...

Curtis moves to the front of his Army. The excitement and
smell of revolt spreads over the crowd. He shouts:

CURTIS
OK, OK - huddle up.

Army sets the pipe down with a loud boom. We see the pipe
runs from here all the way up to the gate along one wall. At
the gate, Edgar, his chin on a cross bar, keeps watch.

Curtis stands above his Army - seated on the pipe. He speaks
low but with force:

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Check your weapons. Make sure they
are small enough to hide in your
clothes.

ON METAL ROD as ARABIC MAN slips it inside his belt and puts
his shirt over the top.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Keep enough distance between the
second and the third teams! At the
rear...

BLARE - BLARE - the alarm, the March tune and blinking lights
erupt surprisingly. Edgar comes running from the Gate.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
What...?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 26.

EDGAR
Schedule change! They moved it
up...they’re coming...they’re
coming!

In confusion, the Army lifts and drops the pipe with a boom.
Lifts and...

CURTIS
Stop! Don’t panic!

...drops - BOOM. Curtis climbs on the pipe and shouts:

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Stick to the plan! This is it.

The Passengers turn into a chaotic mass, running back and
forth and slamming into one another. Curtis moves to his
place - mid-line - while Edgar and Tanya hurry to the front.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
(muttering)
Four seconds, three doors...

CUT TO:
RUMBLE - RUMBLE - the train rumbles on.

The screen is filled with the image of the steel Gate as in
the introduction. A Soldier’s Hand pushes open the heavy
Gate.

Passengers stand in lines of five as usual, as if nothing was
amiss. Soldiers, likewise, push the carts of protein blocks
per the routine. Curtis eyes the cart’s wheels.

Edgar takes up position ‘five’ to obscure the pipe, Tanya
takes ‘six’ directly behind him. Edgar is agitated. If he
sits, the pipe will be revealed.

SOLDIER 1
Head check!

“One” “Two” - call out and crouch. Edgar is agitated. If he
shouts “Five” and sits, the sewer pipe will be exposed to the
Soldiers. “Three!” “Four!:” the man in front of Edgar shouts
and crouches.

EDGAR
Five, six, pick up sticks!

TANYA
Seven, eight, open the gate!

Soldier 1 steps forward towards Edgar.

SOLDIER 1
You're five.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 27.

Tanya and Edgar joyfully, loudly play the counting game:

EDGAR AND TANYA
Nine, ten - say it again!

SOLDIER 1
No, you're five - you're six...

EDGAR
You're Seven!

TANYA
(to approaching Soldier 2)
You're Eight!

CLICK - CLICK - Soldiers 2 and 3 step forward and point
rifles at the heads of Edgar and Tanya. Their eyes go wide
with fright - this wasn’t supposed to happen...

PAINTER
Let’s eat! Come on!

PASSENGERS
Let’s eat!! We want to eat!! Eat!
Eat! Eat! Eat!

Passengers shout and jump up and down - there is pandemonium.

Soldier 1 summons the other Soldiers for a huddle as the
shouting and stomping continues. We catch snippets of the
Soldiers’ argument:

SOLDIERS
..-head check...waste of
time...just give the shit...

SOLDIER 1
OK, OK.
(steps forward with arms
raised)
Quiet down! You will count off as
you get your protein blocks. Go.

Passengers move forward to take protein blocks, count off and
retreat to the rear. As Edgar moves to Curtis, Tanya takes
his space to obscure the pipe. The Army remains in place to
hide the pipe. All eyes turn to the nervous Curtis and
Gilliam.

GILLIAM
(in a low voice)
Still going for it, are we?

EDGAR
Now? Finally now?

Curtis observes the Soldiers, the Carts, the Gates - the
rifles. Edgar flushes with excitement and bloodlust.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 28.
CURTIS
The rifles.
EDGAR
Fuck ‘em. We outnumber their
bullets. Curtis.
Curtis weighs his decision - this is the moment of truth.
A LATIN WOMAN, chewing her protein block, suddenly clamps
onto something. She pulls out a metal capsule. The capsule

is passed hand to hand until it reaches Curtis.

GILLIAM
Red Letter?

Curtis stares at it in his palm without opening it.

EDGAR
What the fuck? Open it!

SCREECH - the gate begins to open...

Edgar, impatient, grabs the capsule away to open it but
fumbles it and it falls to the floor.

Curtis watches a Soldier’s back walking towards the prison
section opening the gates one by one.

Edgar kneels to retrieve the capsule rolling away from him.

At the moment when the three gates open at the same time,
Curtis, with lightening speed, bolts for the First Gate.

Edgar grabs the rolling capsule and tries to open it.
Gilliam and all others stare at him in shock.
Curtis charges at Soldier 1 who aims his gun:

SOLDIER 1
Stop! Stop!

Curtis grabs the barrel of the rifle, puts it to his own
forehead and reaches for the trigger with his other hand.
Soldier 1 is so taken aback that he turns into a blue-faced
statue. Everyone, paralyzed in shock, stares at Curtis.
With a roar, Curtis pulls the trigger.

CURTIS
Ahhhhhhhh!

CLICK - nothing.
EDGAR

(shouting)
THEY’VE GOT NO BULLETS!
17

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 29.

EDGAR drops the Red Letter: “No Bullets.”

Passengers overwhelm the Soldiers like a vast human tsunami.
Curtis viciously kicks Soldier 1 in the gut. The Soldiers
fall like leaves under a hail of fists, steel rods and
confiscated rifles used as clubs.

CURTIS
Go! Forward!

EDGAR
Go! Forward!

Tanya and Army lift up the sewer pipe-battering ram.

BANG - the ram smashes into the protein block cart. The
cart, stuck into the pipe, is propelled forward. Curtis
jumps on the cart as it passes through the first gate,
propelled by the awesome power of the Army.

BLARE - BLARE - alarms sound.

SOLDIER 1
Close the gates!

Curtis' POV: the second meshed-steel gate rapidly approaches.

The cart wheels spin intensely. Curtis and the battering ram
pass through the second iron gate.

SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
Close the gates now!

Soldier 5 runs like hell to push a button to shut the gates.

One of the cart wheels bounces off into the air! SCREECH -
the cart’s metal bottom sprays bright sparks from the
friction with the metal floor. Undaunted, the Army shouts in
defiance, letting out a deafening roar, and keeps pushing.

Soldier 5 jumps up to push the button but Curtis is faster.
He pushes Soldier 5 down and the ram goes through the Gate.

BOOM - the battering ram is abandoned. The sliding Gate
bites the pipe to no avail. The “mob” rushes through the
Gate, beating and subduing any remaining Soldiers with
primitive, makeshift weapons.

INT. PRISON SECTION

Curtis, atop the Cart, Edgar and Tanya survey the fallen
Soldiers with the bright sheen of the temporarily insane.

Heavily armed Prison Guards, equipped with shields, helmets
and dully threatening clubs flow out to meet the rabble.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 30.

CURTIS
(shouting)
Team 1 retreat!

EDGAR
Team 1 retreat!

CURTIS
Team 2 forward!

EDGAR
Team 2 forward!

Team 1, breathing heavily, falls back while Team 2, the
biggest men, move forward imposingly from the rear. Prison
Guards, unlike the scurrilous Soldiers, move in a tight,
streamlined manner to dominate the small Prison Section.

BANG - the two groups clash; the blows from Team 2’s steel
rods fall on the shields like rain.

KIIIII - the train takes a curve, the open Gate grates on the
battering ram. The screeching noise is soon lost in the
battle roars as Team 2 forces the Guards back in retreat.

PRISONERS confined in oddly designed chambers scream their
heads off, encouraging the Team 2 Rebels.

CURTIS
PUSH!

EDGAR
PUSH!

A MONGOLIAN GIANT appears from behind the Guards, as if
swimming against the tide of Team 2. He is a head and a half
taller than the Guards and carries a gargantuan spanner.

GIANT
(in Mongolian)
Ma ne kiris yava!!!
The Giant swings the spanner like a baseball bat, hitting
Team 2 Rebels left and right. The tide changes - Team 2 is
pushed back. Edgar, without intending to, comes up face to
face with the Giant.

EDGAR
(in a small voice)
Um... Curtis?
Curtis withdraws a steel rod and walks forward.

Gilliam, at the rear, observing coolly, turns to the YOUNG
MAN behind him.

GILLIAM
Grey... You go.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 31.

He drops his battered coat to reveal a body lean as a whip, *
strong as taut steel and covered with scars and tattoos - all *
words. He holds a peculiar steel rod. The Giant, breathing *
hard, swings the spanner as he stares at Grey. *
GILLIAM (CONT’D) *

*

«+. Now!

Grey jumps into the air, kicking the walls, and LEVITATES
gracefully above the Giant’s head who barely has time to look
up before Grey’s steel rod SLAMS into the crown of his bald
head.

The Giant goes down without a peep. CLANK - the prison keys
on Giant’s belt hit the metal train floor as he lands.

The tide changes for the final time as Team 2 goes berserk,
pushing the Guards forward into the next Train Section. When
the last Guard is kicked beyond the threshold, Edgar locks
the steel gate - CLUNK.

The Army, Teams 1 and 2, and Tanya jump up and down, roaring
with joy and triumph. Victory!

Grey picks up the bundle of keys from the Mongolian’s
waistband and presents it to Gilliam, bypassing Curtis.

CURTIS
(slightly stumped)

GILLIAM
(searching through keys)
So which one of these lead us to
our security expert?

TIME CUT - Curtis walks past the chambers looking at and
checking each prisoner, who scream their heads off, asking *
Curtis to get them out of the Prison Section.

At the very end of the Prison Section is the “Punishment
Ward” composed of a series of drawers, each big enough to fit
an adult body, in a design similar to a morgue.

Curtis reads the labels on the drawers.
ON LABEL: “Nam Koong Min Soo” with smaller writing beneath.

CURTIS
(reading)
“Nam Koong Min Soo...Chronole
Addict.”

EDGAR
Chronole? Fuck that - we don’t
want a Chronohead.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 32.

Gilliam passes the bundle of keys to Curtis who respectfully
takes it and then tosses it to grumbling Edgar.

CURTIS
Edgar, hurry up and open it.

EDGAR
(fingering the key bundle)
Why do you always give me the
shittiest jobs?

CURTIS
Because I trust you.

Edgar rolls his eyes - “how do I argue with that?”

Edgar, annoyed, tries each key on the keyhole this way and
that way. He inserts a small key and - CLICK. With an
expectant smile, he pulls open the drawer.

NAMGOONG MINSOO, a big-bodied, unruly-haired Asian man lies
inside, his face covered with an unshaven beard. Edgar pokes
him with the tip of the key, but Namgoong is as unmoving as a
log. Curtis shakes Namgoong who does not respond.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Hey, wake up!

Curtis holds up the cloth bag. He extracts a lump of
Chronole. Gilliam standing next to him, pensively takes a
sniff.

GILLIAM
Is this Chronole?

CURTIS
Yes. It’s an industrial resource
they used in the Cargo Section -
highly flammable. If you inhale
the stuff, you start to
hallucinate. Sort of like opiates.
I hear it’s big in the front

sections.
GILLIAM
Mmmm...
CURTIS
(to himself)

The best way to control a druggie
is - drugs.

Curtis places a lump of Chronole under Namgoong’s nostrils.
Namgoong suddenly wakes up, sniffing.

NAMGOONG
(waking)
Uhhh...

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 33.

CURTIS
Are you Nam Koong Min Soo?
(no response)
Kyungnam Corporation, security
specialist?

Namgoong looks at the faces hovering over him like a sleepy-
eyed, hibernating bear suddenly awakened. He projects a weird
vibe: goofy and mysterious at the same time.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Are you the guy who designed and
installed the door-locks and
security provisions on this train?

No response.

EDGAR
What’s wrong with you - you fry
your fucking brain with that shit?

CURTIS
Nam! Are you listening? Nam?

Namgoong, tired, regards Edgar, then reaches on the wall to
snatch up a small machine labelled “Simultaneous
Interpretation Service.”

Namgoong pushes a button and the readout declares “Language
Code 27 = Korean.”

NAMGOONG
(sighs, in Korean: )
Yes, I am listening... fuck...

INTERPRETER
Yes, I am listening, fuck.

The interpreter’s voice is that of a bright, clean young
woman. The bizarre contrast between the kind, polite voice
and “fuck” stops everyone in their tracks.

NAMGOONG
(Korean)
And my name is not Naem! Nahm!
And it’s Nahm-Goong! That's my
last name! Min-Soo is my first
name. Got that? Fucking idiots!

The interpreter beeps frantically: “Please repeat slowly.”
Everyone simply stares at Namgoong, utterly befuddled.
Curtis holds another interpreter unit in his hand.

CURTIS
Anyway, we want your cooperation.

NAMGOONG
For what?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 34.

CURTIS
You can open all the gates in this
train.

Namgoong is silent.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
We're going to the front and we
need you to open all the gates.

NAMGOONG
What if I say no?

Curtis stares at him intently and then shows him the lump of
Chronole. Namgoong tries to remain stoic but cannot hide
minute ripples of desire in his expression.

CURTIS

For every gate you open, one lump
of Chronole.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
It’s the best shit. Uncut.
Straight from the barrel.

Curtis flips the lump to Namgoong. Namgoong lets it drop to
the floor and stares at Curtis. Beat. He bends down,
seemingly to pick it up but instead removes a piece of
cigarette and a MATCHBOOK from his shoe.

“Wow!” - everyone looks with eyes rounded like saucers.

TANYA
Marlboro Lights?!

PAINTER
Holy shit - cigarettes have been
extinct for a decade now...

ON MATCHBOOK: a bright sun blazes over a beautiful sandy
beach, advertising “FIJI”

Everyone pushes forward to watch Namgoong open the matchbook -
FOUR MATCHES. He plucks one, strikes it, lights the

cigarette and sucks on it for a long stretch. Everyone is
dizzy in shock. Even Curtis’ eyes flutter as the smell hits
him.

NAMGOONG
(to Curtis)
You want some, asshole?

Namgoong blows smoke in the air. Several people breathe in
the scattered wisps of smoke, their eyelids fluttering.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 35.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
I bet you fuckheads never smoked
one before, huh?

CURTIS
You're a fucking Chronohead so let
me make this real simple for you.
Help us, you get your drug. Don’t,
we put you back where we found you.
What’1ll it be, asshole?

NAMGOONG

The People tense up. A Chinese boy suddenly runs to Nam and
snatches the matchbook from his hand. People shocked, stare
at Chan running off.

Namgoong stares at him and then throws the cigarette butt
aside.

“Yikes!” - all at once, the crowd dives toward the butt. The
space between Namgoong and Curtis fills with milling bodies.

POW - Namgoong’s fist lands squarely in the center of Edgar's
face - blood erupts. He kneels on Edgar’s abdomen and
snatches the keys from Edgar’s hands. He rises...

KAPOW! Namgoong knocks out each man who tries to stop him
from “escaping.” Curtis grabs Namgoong’s shirt. But
Namgoong stops before another drawer and locates a key.

Namgoong opens the lock and pulls the drawer out to reveal
YONA (17), an Asian girl, dead asleep despite all the
commotion in the section. He pokes at the girl’s head.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Get up.

YONA
Shit...

Yona reluctantly sits up - dirty and clad in short pants and
a T-shirt. She drapes herself in rags she used as a blanket.

NAMGOONG
My daughter, Yona. If I go, she
goes too.

CURTIS

So you're coming with us?

NAMGOONG
One gate, two lumps of Chronole.
Two people - two lumps.
18

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 36.

Yona completely ignores the curious stares from the crowd and
concentrates on dressing. She seems totally out of it;
carelessly yawns, then burps. Curtis considers her.

CURTIS

She’s an addict, too?

INT. PRISON SECTION - GATE
CLOSE UP of Yona’s strange, dreamy eyes.
YONA’'S POV: Namgoong manipulates complicated machinery inside
a wall panel with spider-dancing fingers. The Steel Gate is

flanked by the Rebel Army, ready to jump as soon as it opens.

Yona suddenly grins a little and mumbles:

YONA
Nobody there.

CURTIS
Nobody...?

Yona puts her hand out and shouts clearly in English:

YONA
No Chronole, no opening!

Curtis hands Yona two lumps of Chronole, while keeping his
eyes on Namgoong.

SWOOSH - the hydraulic gate opens. Edgar and the Army,
weapons out, flood into the next Section to find it totally
empty. Deflated, they move gingerly into the forward
section. Curtis regards Yona suspiciously...

CURTIS
How did you know...?

Yona rushes to Namgoong with her prizes - Chronole.
Namgoong, holding a lump in each hand, claps and rubs them
together with furious speed. The Chronole crumbles to dust
which Namgoong continuously and eagerly sniffs.

Yona, next to him, stamps her feet repeatedly waiting for her
turn until Nam passes the chronole to her. Sniffing,
sniffing...

Druggies. Curtis shakes his head and turns back to his Army.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Forward! Move!

EDGAR
Forward! Move!
19

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 37.

INT. GUARD SECTION

Edgar and the Army advance, repeating after Curtis. Gilliam
and Grey bring up the rear. Namgoong and Yona, playfully
kicking each other, move into a corner to sniff Chronole.
Edgar breaks the silence:

EDGAR
Where the fuck is everybody?

EDGAR’s POV: the Prison Guards have left in a rush. The
floor is strewn with shields and clubs.

PAINTER (0.S.)
This can't be a window, can it?

At that moment, the train moves out of a tunnel, and the
walls on the sides are revealed to be windows. Dazzling
sunlight pours into the section through the wide windows.

The Rebel Army is regaled with a sight that none of them has
witnessed for seventeen years: a mind-blowing vista of frozen
snowscape, that seems to stretch to eternity.

Everyone is frozen in place, mouths open, eyes wide open in
amazement.

EDGAR
Fuck me.

PAINTER
Oh my God, it’s so... so...
beautiful.

TANYA
So huge...

Gilliam is the only one who does not look like a deer caught
in the headlights.

GILLIAM
-+-and still cold.

The train races through the frozen snow plain. Then, a long
abandoned train station in a small town can be seen - on a
platform are piles of corpses, frozen to death in the middle
of a fierce struggle to get on the train to survive.

GILLIAM (CONT’D)
Dead. All dead.

The long-frozen landscape of the small town rushes past -
overturned cars frozen in place, helicopters suspended where
they crashed. A doomsday landscape preserved in the exact
state of their final moments, flickers past without end...
20

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 38.

Curtis is mesmerized but he pulls himself back from his
trance - he shakes his head violently to re-focus. He looks
away. He pokes, prods and pulls at his Army.

CURTIS
Enough! We didn’t come for this.
Everyone focus! Keep moving!

EDGAR
Keep moving!

Everyone tears themselves away from the endlessly unfolding
snowscape to look forward once again. Painter pulls out his
sketchbook and furiously captures what he has seen.

Namgoong opens a small panel on the floor by the next Gate.
Yona once again opens her palm to Curtis.

YONA
No Chronole, no opening!

CURTIS
(handing out the lumps)
How did you know there wasn’t
anybody in here?

Yona does not acknowledge Curtis. Like a zoo monkey with a
banana, she snatches away the lumps of Chronole and hastily
retreats. Namgoong’s efforts produce a bright spark.

Yona suddenly straightens up - her head cocked to one side as
she looks at the Gate.

YONA
Coming this way... He’s
running...??

CURTIS
(not understanding)
2?!
SWOOOOSH - a heavier sound this time as the steel Gate opens.
Everyone waits anxiously as Curtis steps into:

INT. PROTEIN BLOCK MANUFACTURING SECTION

HIGH-SPEED CAM: a slow motion image of PAUL, a man in a white
chef's uniform, running toward the bewildered Army.

CURTIS
Paul?

Paul jumps up and grabs a ceiling pipe. Hanging down, he
grunts and swings, turning one of the valves in a weird way.

EDGAR
Paul!

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 39.

Paul, barely acknowledging and bowing his head carelessly,
jumps down with a boom and breathlessly runs off to tend a
big machine resembling a fertilizer manufacturing device.

EDGAR (CONT'D)
Paul, man! I don’t believe it!
How many years has it been since
they dragged you...?

PAUL
Give me a second. It used to work
automatically...

Paul runs and jumps up onto another pipe. Grunting, he turns
a valve, twitching like a pig in a butcher shop. Curtis and
Edgar move to him as he drops to the floor.

CURTIS
What are you doing?

PAUL
(embarrassed)
The parts went extinct so I have to
do this manually...

EDGAR
Do what?

Paul hurries away to another valve which he turns once and -
WHOOSH - the machine kicks in and begins spitting out protein
blocks from its mouth. The Army gathers around the machine
watching with curiosity and affection.

TANYA
Ah ha - so that’s how it’s made...

Painter flips the sketchbook page from Frozen Landscape to a
blank page to draw the machine as he circles it. Behind, he
discovers a black powdery substance - the raw material for
the protein blocks - passing through a thick glass tube.

Curtis pulls Paul aside from the machine and the others.

CURTIS

So you're the informant?
PAUL

What? Hey!!

Paul sees Painter climbing to a platform to look inside the
tank feeding the glass tube. He runs after him.

PAUL (CONT'D)
No! No - get away from there.

Painter pulls back a hatch on top of the tank and looks
inside just as Paul arrives to shove him aside!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 40.

PAINTER
Yecch!

Painter bends over, ready to throw up. Curtis looks inside
the tank.

CURTIS

CURTIS’ POV: the tank is full of millions of cockroaches,
interlocked in a hellish vision of crawling, squirming
movement. They seem to be cannibalizing one another.

Crushed body parts are visible. The cockroaches are fed into
a grinder that turns them to black powder.

PAINTER
All this time, we’ve been
eating...?

PAUL
I eat them, too, you know...every
single day...

CURTIS

(to painter)
You can’t draw this.

Painter nods, still gagging, as he rips the page from his
sketchbook and tears it up.

ANGLE - the Army eats fresh protein blocks spewing from the
machine’s output belt. Tanya, her mouth full, shoves blocks
into her pockets.

TANYA
Oh my God, oh my God, they’re still
hot. Mmmm - fresh, yummy...

Painter, watching this, now vomits.

CURTIS
(looking at Tanya)
This is the last time. We’ll never
have to eat that shit again.

PAUL
What else would they...?

CURTIS
We're going to the front - come
with us Paul. Join us.

PAUL
The front? No - my place is here.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1,

CURTIS
Here - making that? Fuck that.
Come with us - we’ll change
everything.
(Paul shakes his head)
Isn't that why you’ve been sending
us the Red Letters?

PAUL
Oh - these?
(he takes a metal capsule
from his pocket)
I don’t write them. I just send
them on.

CURTIS
You don’t...?

Curtis snatches the capsule and opens it as he comes back
down the ladder. Gilliam moves to join Curtis.

GILLIAM
Red letter, lad?

ON RED LETTER: “W A T E R”

CURTIS
.--Water?

GILLIAM
The Water Supply Section?

PAUL
It’s only a few cars away. That’s
where the water is cleansed and
recycled.

GILLIAM
It’s one of the most crucial
sections in the train...

CURTIS
If we seize it - we'll have the
upper hand, yes?

GILLIAM
We won’t even have to get all the
way to the front. We control the
water, we control the negotiation.

Gilliam shrugs. Curtis’ eyes are ablaze as he looks ahead at

the next Gate.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 42.

INT. GATE - PROTEIN BLOCK MANUFACTURING SECTION/ABANDONED
SECTION

Namgoong works on a complicated panel, his eyes vaguely
unfocused. He frowns - things are not going his way. He
switches wires around but nothing happens.

EDGAR
(frustrated)
Come on already! You're keeping us
waiting?

Namgoong looks around, not a bit flustered, pushing the
sensor portion of the translator against his lower neck.

NAMGOONG
Am I?

EDGAR
That's right. You've been sucking
on Chronole so much, your brain is
probably protein gruel by now!

NAMGOONG
Hey, Chronole is the only reason
I‘m doing this shit.

EDGAR
That stuff’s the reason you’re such
a head case, man!

NAMGOONG
You're the one who gives me the
stuff every time I open the gate.

EDGAR
That’s the condition for opening
the gate!

NAMGOONG

So that’s what I’m doing, trying to
open the gate.

While this surreal verbal sparring through the electronic
sound of the translator machine is going on, everyone with
weapons in their hands is getting tired, waiting in front of
the door.

CURTIS
Yona?

Yona: “what do you want?”

CURTIS (CONT'D)
How old are you?

YONA
Seventeen.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 43.

CURTIS
You're a train baby, then?
YONA
Hee hee. It’s been rattling like
this all my life. ‘Bout you?
CURTIS

I lived in New York for seventeen
years. Then the Tail Section
seventeen years.

YONA
34. You're old. What was New York
like?

CURTIS

Not that different from the tail
section. Crowded and dirty.

YONA
So your whole life has been crowded
and dirty.

CURTIS

Yeah, pretty much. In New York, I
was drifting around like a lost

turd.
YONA
And now?
CURTIS
I'm different now.
YONA
How?
CURTIS
Now I know where I’m going.
YONA
Where?
CURTIS
To the front.
YONA
Mmm. .
CURTIS
Hey, Yona. Were you born
clairvoyant?
YONA
Clair... What’s that?

CUT TO:

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 44.

Curtis and Yona standing in front of the gate.

CURTIS
Can you see what’s beyond this
gate? Do you see anything?

YONA
I see sounds.
(he doesn’t understand)
I can even see the sound of snow
falling outside...

Yona lapses into silence - listening. She suddenly contorts
her face in fear.

CURTIS
What is it?

YONA
(quietly)
Don’t open it...

Yona, deathly pale, jumps up and screams shrilly at Namgoong.

YONA (CONT'D)
LOCK THE GATE!!!

Everyone is stunned by her unexpected scream which comes too
late:

WHOOSH - the Steel Gate opens and heavily armored Soldiers
carrying hand-axes flow in.

CURTIS
(rising and shouting)
Teams 1 and 2 Forward!

EDGAR
Teams 1...!

Edgar's command is drowned out as the Army rises up with a
roar and steel rods.

CLASH - axe blades clash against steel rods - sparks fly!
Bodies and blades clash and slice. The axe blades cut swaths
of silver in the air and push back the Army.

Grey stands protectively in front of Gilliam. Curtis moves
Yona back, handing her to the retreating Namgoong. He joins
the battle swinging a big metal bat down on a Soldier. He
snatches the Soldier's falling hand-axe and kills him.

SPLASH - blood is showered on Curtis' face. He does not
hesitate: eyes burning with savage bloodlust, he swings and
swings his newfound weapon.

Sunlight pours through the windows. The sweat and blood on
the galvanized bodies shine like jewels.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 45.

The screams, shouts and grunts gradually dwindle replaced by
the cold metallic clanging of axe-blades striking steel and
the rattling of the train.

Arabic Man fights a Soldier with one hand while stuffing his
face with a hoarded protein block with the other.

Fuyu enters with his Atlas and a Bullhorn. He consults his
Atlas, then his wristwatch and nods to an ATTENDANT who
sounds an enormous HORN - WAAAAA. Fuyu lifts the bullhorn.

FUYU
(beep from the bullhorn)
Passing Yekaterina Bridge!

Curtis and the Soldier he is fighting stop and peek outside
the window. It dawns on everybody what is happening.
Soldiers and Army alike, breathing hard, stop fighting and
drop their weapons to look out the window.

EDGAR
Yekaterina Bridge? It’s been a
year, already?

FUYU
Ten seconds to Yekaterina Bridge!
Ten, nine...

Everyone joins in the countdown in a babel of languages:

ALL
Eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one!

FUYU
(loudly, through bullhorn)
Happy New Year!

SOLDIERS
Happy New Year!

EDGAR
(abruptly shouting)
Fuck it, I hate getting old...

Fuyu leads the Officers chanting Buddhist-like prayers.

FUYU
Youkiguni dai zohachinen,
engine yo aei en ni.
(The 18th year of the snow piercer,
Engine be forever!)

OFFICERS
(like chorus)
Engine yo aei en ni! Wilford Ban
zai!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 46.

Curtis and Army stare at this ceremony, uncomprehending.

FUYU
Everybody down!

Edgar drops face down on the floor. Everybody follows suit.
A Soldier with a peculiar helmet prays.

FUYU (CONT'D)
(in French)
Everybody down!
(in Japanese)
Everybody down!

CURTIS
Get down! Watch your tongues!
Clamp your teeth!

Everyone gets down except Fuyu who walks to the window and
Curtis who, kneeling, glues his face to the window-pane.

CURTIS’ POV: as the train makes a stiff turn, the ENGINE CAR
can be seen - ridiculously far away. It’s silver, sleek
rounded, bullet-shape nose races along the frozen landscape.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Wilford...

The nose transforms into a sharp arrow-headed lance to pierce
the unseen snow and ice ahead.

The front section races onto a precarious-looking bridge over
a vast valley of frozen ice fields. It is God-knows-how many
hundreds of feet down to the valley floor in a descent almost
totally vertical.

FUYU’S POV: massive white boulders of snow and ice block the
path of the rapidly approaching engine - closer and closer...

FUYU
IMPACT!

Curtis flattens beside Edgar. The train shakes like a
submarine hit directly by a torpedo. Everybody screams and
tries to grab something to keep them from flying away.

The wheels jump into thin air for a half-second then smash
down on the rails amidst a rain of sparks. The train slowly
regains its stable rhythm. People sigh in relief.

FUYU (CONT'D)
Not yet! A second one!

CURTIS
Hold on!

Once again, the train crashes into a large block of snow,
shaking violently from the impact.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 47.

ANGLE - Soldiers and Rebel Army crouch low on the floor.
Beyond them - Yona and Namgoong stand straight up with
Chronole held to their noses. Edgar sees them and shouts:

EDGAR
Hey! Get down on the floor!

Namgoong crouches down as if to follow Edgar's advice but,
instead, hoists Yona up on his shoulders. High on Chronole,
he walks unsteadily towards the window as Yona laughs.

EDGAR (CONT'D)
That guy doesn’t follow the

rules...

CURTIS
He’s crazy - we have to watch out
for him.

Namgoong and Yona press their noses to the glass, they look
down at the dizzying depths below.

YONA
Wow!

NAMGOONG
Sure enough, a thrill that comes
once a year...

NAMGOONG’S POV: a dizzying glimpse of a gorge down below.
Yona, either from the drugs or the view, squeals in delight.

FUYU
Yukino katamarida~!

The train smashes through snow boulders - white, crystalline
fragments slide off into the valley, so far down they get
lost in the white. Lurching wildly, the train shakes left
and right, up and down...

Tumbling, the people roll and crash into each other. With
Yona on Namgoong's shoulders, the two become even more
excited and shout loudly.

NAMGOONG/YONA
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!

The wheels of the train shake so wildly that it seems it is
about to derail, but finally they take a precarious hold on
the tracks and become stable.

Fuyu pulls himself upright and, carefully looking out towards
the front of the train, pronounces:

FUYU
Safe passage!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 48.

The train moves off the perilous bridge onto solid ground.
Everyone - Soldiers and Army alike - rise and cheer; people
cross themselves, others embrace, some resume chanting:

OFFICERS
Engine yo aei en ni! Wilford Ban
zai!

EDGAR

We made it!

Curtis brandishes his axe in a fearsome gesture. Edgar and
Arabic Man, flanking Curtis, raise their weapons.

CLASH - the two sides form up and the battle resumes!

Suddenly, a spear flies in from out of nowhere and pierces
Arabic Man’s chest. As he falls, another heavy spear flies
through the air towards Curtis. At the last moment, Curtis
deflects the spear with his axe blade.

Everyone turns and looks in the direction from which the
spears came: the Franco Brothers.

With expressionless faces, the brothers advance. Directly
behind, Mason appears. In this strange lull in the fighting,
Mason walks forward with a hard expression and a microphone.
His cold voice issues from the speakers:

MASON
Happy Yekaterina Bridge, you filthy
ingrates!

The blood-spattered faces of Curtis and Edgar, and behind
them Gilliam, turn towards Mason.

MASON (CONT’D)
You people, who if not for the
benevolent Wilford, would have
frozen solid 18 years ago today!
You people, who have sucked on the
generous tit of Wilford for food
and shelter! And now... You
pathetic stowaways, you repay his
kindness with violent hooliganism?

CURTIS

MASON
You people...
(checks memo)
.+-precisely 74% of you shall die!

CURTIS
Fuck you! It is you who is going
to die!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 49.

Curtis' hand-axe, whistling through the air, somersaults
toward Mason’s head but is intercepted by Franco the Elder's
iron club with a loud clang. Mason regards Curtis, half-
insane with rage, with a preternatural calm.

MASON
My friend - you suffer the
misplaced optimism of the doomed.

Mason nods to Fuyu who comes forward opening a large canvas
bag: inside are weird-looking glasses.

CLOSE-UP reveals them to be infrared goggles.

CURTIS
?

The Franco Brothers and the Soldiers fit themselves with the
goggles. Mason follows suit.

MASON
I'll watch from here.

Edgar and the Army stare uncomprehendingly.

NAMGOONG
(in Korean)
You guys are fucked.

CURTIS

(putting the interpreter
earphone in)
What did you say?

Curtis turns to see: Namgoong, holding a pulled off panel, *
squeezing Yona into the gap in the wall. *
NAMGOONG

You Tail Section hicks. There’s no
way you could know there’s a tunnel
right after Yekaterina Bridge.

CURTIS
A tunnel?

NAMGOONG
That’s right. A fucking long one.

Namgoong swiftly puts the panel back on the wall over Yona’s *
confused face. *

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
(after taking a deep *
breath) *
Run, idiots!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 50.

The lights go off one by one until the Train enters the
tunnel. We are plunged into darkness. Soldiers, in frog-
like goggles, flash as green after-images, then are gone.

HMMMMM - a low hum is heard. *

A SOLDIER'S POV: everything is awash in sickly green: the
Rebels move frantically about, running into walls and each
other. The Franco Brothers and Soldiers charge at them. *

Screams and shouts emanate from every corner. A Soldier

creeps up next to an Army fighter entangled with another *
Soldier and lifts his hand-axe slowly above the fighter’s

head, grinning.

Franco the Younger aims his spear at another warrior who
swings his steel pipe blindly and desperately, without aim.
Franco the Younger pushes and pulls the tip of his spear
close to the latter’s face, having sadistic fun with it.

CURTIS
Light! We need light!
EDGAR
(feeling his way along the
wall)
Light!
CURTIS
Nam! Can you turn the lights back
on!?
NAMGOONG *
No... *
Namgoong is already running as fast as he can to the back, *
pushing and stepping over people. Horrible sounds of bones *
breaking, veins bursting, flesh tearing and the skin-crawling
sound of metal on metal fill the place. *

Fuyu follows close on the heels of the Franco brothers,

clicking a counter as each man falls down dead. He seems to

be smiling but, incongruously, his eyes behind the goggles *
are full of tears.

FUYU
Nana, Hachi...

Mason, like a school principal inspecting a children’s
exercise, watches calmly.

Curtis' face shows despair for the first time, as the bodies
of his Army pile up. Then, suddenly remembering:

INSERT - (from Scene # 17) image of Namgoong dropping the *
matchbook on the floor and Chan snatching it up.
22

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 51.

CURTIS

Chan! CHAN! We need fire!
EDGAR

Chan?
CURTIS

To the rear! Chan! We need fire!

EDGAR
Chan! FIRE! Pass it on!!

The call is taken up and relays back through the Sections.
Some do not even know what it means: “Chan!” “Fire!”

INT. TAIL SECTION - TENT

Chan, crouching by Gilliam’s tent, hears his name echo back
to him. He gets up, wondering; then he hears, “FIRE!” He

frantically reaches into his pockets to find the matchbook.
He opens it - three matches remain - and plucks a match.

PFFFT - a tiny flame lights up the consuming darkness,
reflecting on his face. He tears a piece of fabric of the
tent and ignites it with the burning match. He wraps the
burning cloth on a stick to make a torch.

Curtis, far away, closes his eyes and speaks calmly:

CURTIS
.--Run!

Chan runs!

INT. TRAIN SECTIONS - CONTINUOUS

Chan runs faster and faster, shaking and twisting, panting
and swinging the torch, getting faster and faster.

An adult hand grabs the torch from Chan. It’s Andrew. Naked
to the waist, he flies like a bat out of hell, holding the
flame aloft like an Olympic torch. The stump of the severed
arm shakes violently, drawing small half-circles in the air.

The screams and shouts from the bloody battle grow louder as
the torch moves forward. Suddenly, Andrew’s feet - only one
with a shoe - get tangled and he falls down!

Someone with the grace and speed of a tiger shark snatches
the torch from Andrew’s hand - and illuminates his
inscrutable face: Grey.
24

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 52.

INT. ABANDONED SECTION

SOLDIER'S INFRARED POV: a bright white spot grows larger as
it gets closer. Grey, Andrew, Chan and dozens following
them, bear torches. In an instant, the field of vision is
awash with an exploding nova, blinding the Soldier.

The Soldier, with a yelp, throws off the goggles. Grey's
fist, like a supersonic piston, hits his face. He staggers
back and Curtis' hand-axe buries itself deeply in his
shoulder.

SOLDIER
Aaaaah!

The surviving Rebels remove their shirts to use as impromptu
torches. Burning with bloodlust, they attack. Curtis swings
his hand-axe, dropping Soldiers left and right. He sees Fuyu
and Mason far away over the Soldiers:

Grey, jumping from head to head of Soldiers, lands on Fuyu’s
back. He puts the dagger on Fuyu’s throat and sticks his
forearm in Fuyu’s face - “Surrender.” Grey quickly shows
Fuyu his other forearm: “Die.” Fuyu, frightened, shouts with
absurdly clear diction:

FUYU
Surrender!

Everyone stops and turns their attention to Grey and Fuyu.

FUYU (CONT'D)
Surrender! He will kill me if we
don’t surrender!

Fuyu’s desperate eyes plead with Mason. Mason shrugs: “So
what?” Fuyu, disappointed, mumbles:

FUYU (CONT'D)
Anatawa hontoni ganbekki desune...

Grey slashes his throat in an instant and leaps towards
Mason. Franco the Elder blocks his path. Franco and Grey
engage in a spectacular fight-to-the-death battle.

Mason slinks towards the forward Section. Grey, while
fighting off Franco the Elder, finds a split-second to throw
his dagger at Mason, hitting him in the thigh.

MASON
Aaaaah.

Mason stumbles. His short AIDE-DE-CAMP helps Mason up as
Curtis charges shaking off Soldiers who try to block him like
raindrops on a wet dog. Franco the Elder is unable to break
away from Grey and stop Curtis.

Curtis is just about to capture Mason alive...
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 53.

EDGAR (0.S.)
Curtis!!

Curtis comes to a full stop and turns to Edgar’s voice:
Edgar, pale and trembling, is held by Franco the Younger from
behind, with a knife blade a millimeter from his throat.

Curtis' POV: time slows down. The flame on the nearby torch
dances languidly. Mason slowly seeps out of his vision, like
sloshing liquid. Franco the Younger’s ugly mouth pronounces
“S-U-R-R-E-N-D-E-R” in slow motion.

Curtis hesitates one microsecond before turning his back to
Edgar. Edgar has a microsecond to register despair in his
face, and then Franco’s blade punctures a hole in his neck.

Curtis, hearing Edgar's final scream, cannot look back.
Instead, kicks the Aide-de-Camp aside and captures Mason -
his hand-axe blade touching Mason’s pale throat.

CURTIS
EVERYBODY STOP!

MASON
Stop! Please, everyone...

CURTIS
(drags Mason to the front)
I SAID STOP!

Soldiers, realizing the situation, come to a stop. Franco
the Elder is the last to stop swinging his iron club.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Drop your weapons!

Curtis looks briefly at Edgar - expecting to have his command
repeated. A flash of anguish crosses his face but this is
not the time. His anguish is replaced by a savage look.

At that instant, the train exits the tunnel. Everyone
instinctively shields their eyes, squinting.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
Drop your weapons, I said!

Curtis pushes the axe-blade into the skin of Mason’s throat.
Beads of blood are drawn.

MASON
Do it! For crying out loud - do
what he says!

Soldiers drop their weapons one by one. Finally, the Franco
Brothers dump their clubs reluctantly on the floor.

The Rebels snap into action. With no cheers of triumph this
time, they silently make sure these monsters are bound tight.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 54.

CURTIS
Make sure they are tied together!

There is no one to repeat his words: Edgar is gone. The
soldiers are tied together like bulbs on a Christmas tree and
strung along a pipe.

Curtis holds Mason firmly making sure he does not gaze at
Edgar's body. He subtly twists his stance so that it lies
outside his field of vision.

Franco the Younger stares at Curtis' back as two Rebels tie
his hands in the back.

CLANK - the PANEL right behind Curtis opens. Yona pokes her
head out of her hiding place. Still not following what's
been happening, Yona steps out, stretching her body.

All of a sudden, Franco the Younger explodes in a blur -
snatching a hand-axe from a Rebel and lunging at Curtis'
head. Everyone catches this moment google-eyed, unable to
move...

Except Yona who stomps on a spear lying across a dead body.
The spear leaps up, levered by the body, and plunges through
Franco the Younger’s side belly like a knife through butter.

FRANCO THE YOUNGER
Aahhh!

Yona fall backwards on her butt. He is skewered straight
through - two feet of spear sticking out each side. He falls
and - THUD - lands face up, his eyes still open, at Yona’s
side.

FRANCO THE ELDER
(pupils dilate)

Franco the Younger, face contorted with pain, juts out a
bloody hand and grabs Yona’s face. Yona looks down on him
with a surprisingly calm gaze.

Far from the rear, Namgoong runs toward Yona, pushing people
away. He violently kicks Franco’s bloody hand off Yona’s
face.

YONA’'S POV: over Namgoong’s shoulder wiping blood off her
face, on Franco the Elder’s eyes. His cold, vacant eyes hold
Yona’s eyes for a long time.

Curtis finally allows himself to move to Edgar's body. He
kneels and comes face-to-face with Edgar - eyes and mouth
open in a silent scream. Curtis’ wet eyes shake
uncontrollably.

Gilliam appears out of nowhere and shuts Edgar's eyes.
Everyone watches the scene in silence. Gilliam straightens.

(quietly)
Survivors clean yourselves.

(pointing)
The Water Supply Section. Wash
your blood away...

No one moves until Grey breaks the line first and enters.

On the ceiling are hundreds of pipelines. Grey follows a
pipeline into a large tiled room. He turns on a faucet
allowing the water from a shower head to wash away the grime
and blood from his body.

The half-naked Rebel bodies appear fragile, amidst tall metal
columns, illuminated by golden sunlight peeking through the
grid-works of pipes above.

INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION - MIDDLE

Curtis walks through the gigantic water tanks and busy
networks of water pipes and machinery. He walks past
Namgoong trying to get the matchbook back from Chan. Curtis
keeps walking and gets to a corner that looks like a
separated place from the section.

ANGLE - in a far corner, Mason is bound to a chair, his
infrared goggles still hanging around his neck. Tanya shoves
the portraits of Tim and Andy in his face.

TANYA
Have you seen these kids?

MASON
TANYA
Where did you take them?

MASON
I don’t know anything about...

Tanya glances sideways to catch a glimpse of a hand-axe
swinging towards her - Andrew, enraged, swings at Mason as
Tanya jumps out of the way.

MASON (CONT'D)
No!

Andrew deliberately buries the axe in the wall, an inch away
from Mason’s arm. Tanya grabs hold of Mason.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 56.

TANYA
Where are they!? Tell us!

Andrew shoves his axe in Mason’s face and shows him his
severed arm. Mason shakes with fear.

ANDREW
Tell us or I’11 cut your fucking
arm off! Even shorter than mine,
you bastard!

MASON
Wilford... Wilford knows.

Curtis and Gilliam move to observe Mason.

MASON (CONT’D)
Wilford likes kids. That’s why
Claude brings him...well... It’s
Wilford you want, not me.

Tanya and Andrew look at one another, not sure how to
continue. Breaking the silence, Gilliam steps between them.

GILLIAM
Wilford, that sad man. Is he still
married to his God-forsaken engine?

MASON
The Engine is Sacred and Wilford
Divine...

CURTIS

(stepping forward)
Sent you to die for him, did he?

Mason flinches.

MASON
No. Wilford is merciful...
CURTIS
Call him - see if he will come and

save you.

Mason looks to Gilliam to stop this nonsense. Gilliam shakes
his head:

GILLIAM
Call Wilford.

Mason dismisses Gilliam as the leader and turns to Curtis.
MASON

He won’t come here. He won’t leave
his Engine...
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 57.

CURTIS
We're going to rip you into little
pieces... He still won’t come?

Mason struggles to maintain his composure.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
We control the water. He’1ll have
to come here if we turn it off.

MASON
Turn it off? You’d only be
condemning your own people. The
water comes from the front. The
nose breaks up the snow and ice and
converts it to water.

CURTIS

MASON
Like an elephant trunk, the water
comes in the mouth not the asshole,
Curtis.

Curtis flinches as Mason mentions his name.

MASON (CONT’D)
You look rather confused, Mr.
Curtis Everett.

Curtis, confused, stares at Mason sharply.

MASON (CONT’D)

Yes, Wilford knows you well. He
has been watching you. And we know
you won't harm your own people,
Curtis. Too bad you couldn’t save
your own second in command. What
was his name - Edgar?

CURTIS
Shut the fuck up!

Curtis draws his hand-axe and puts it to Mason’s throat with
a murderous look in his eyes.

MASON
Curtis! Curtis! I can help you.
CURTIS
You can fucking die is what you can
do.
MASON

I can help, I swear I can. Wilford

won't come to you. You’1ll have to

go to him and I can take you there.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 58.

MASON (CONT'D)
I know the train. I can guarantee
you safe passage...

CURTIS
Why the fuck would I trust you?

MASON
Because I want to live.

CURTIS
You'd sell out Wilford the
Benevolent?

MASON
If I take you to the front, you
have to kill him. I/’11 get you
close enough. Kill him and let me
live.

In stark silence, Curtis observes the pathetic Mason -
reduced to near tears. Beat. Curtis withdraws the hand-axe.
INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION - ELSEWHERE

Low singing is heard from the neighboring Section, a dirge
for the fallen Rebels. Gilliam and Curtis sit together.

GILLIAM
You're still determined to push
ahead?

CURTIS

Of course. We’re only half way.

GILLIAM
You've made it farther than anyone
else. Farther than MacGregor four
years ago...

CURTIS
Ten cars, twenty cars, it’s all the
same thing. It makes no difference
unless we make it all the way to
the front, to the engine. They'll
just regroup and attack us again.
We have to pull them out by the
roots.

GILLIAM
But, so many have been killed.
We've lost so many, and so have

they.

CURTIS
Yes, many have died... Our Edgar,
too.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
That’s why we have to move forward.
Or else he died for nothing.

GILLIAM
What about the rest of us? Have
you seen our men? They are
exhausted. I told them to wash up
so I could check the damage.

Curtis nods - sad but unshaken. Beat. Then, without looking
at Gilliam:

CURTIS
Let me go ahead.

GILLIAM
(sighs)

CURTIS
Let me take the strong ones. I’ve
got Mason now - I can move more
quickly. You stay here with the
wounded. Guard our prisoners.
When we have won - I'll bring you
forward to lead us.

GILLIAM
(in a low voice)
Do you want to kill Wilford that
badly?

CURTIS
I want to liberate the Tail
Section. And I want to see the
whole train, the whole world run by
you...

GILLIAM
(cuts him off)
Stop it, Curtis. Why are you doing
this? You know very well that
you're already our leader. You
have to accept that now.

CURTIS
No... I don’t have what it takes,
not yet... How can I lead when I
still have two good arms and two
good legs?

Gilliam looks at Curtis gently, reaches out to Curtis’ left
arm and rolls up the sleeve to see: an old but deep scar.

GILLIAM
Hasn’t faded much...

Curtis, shameful, avoids Gilliam’s hand and pulls his sleeve
down.

GILLIAM (CONT’D)
It’s better to have both arms. You
can’t do much with one, you know.
Especially when you hold a woman,
it’s much better with two arms.
Wouldn’t you agree?

CURTIS

GILLIAM
When you reach the Front, then
there’s Alice, too.

CURTIS
What...?

GILLIAM
She must be in the Front somewhere.
Aren’t you going to look for her?

CURTIS
It’s been too long. I don’t think
about her anymore.

GILLIAM
But, it’1ll be different when you
see her. And two arms will be very
useful when you hold Alice again.

ANGLE - on Curtis’ conflicted face. Gilliam reaches out,
Curtis instinctively avoiding him; but then remains still as
Gilliam pats Curtis on the cheek.

GILLIAM (CONT’D)
When you get there - don’t let
Wilford talk. Cut out his tongue.

Curtis opens his mouth to form the question that has been
eluding him but Gilliam turns away to Grey.

GILLIAM (CONT’D)
Grey - you will go with Curtis.

Grey looks at Gilliam - “no, please don’t make me” in his
eyes. Grey cannot bear this.

GILLIAM (CONT’D)
Grey, my loyal boy. Now you must
help Curtis.

Beat. Grey nods, reluctant but obedient. He holds up his
other hand - “Goodbye.”

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 61.

INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION - GATE
The music takes on the variation of the funeral dirge.

Mason, hands bound in back and missing a shoe, is led forward
by Curtis with Grey at his side. Andrew, with mismatching
shoes, Tanya, Namgoong, and Yona follow.

Painter and the wounded Rebels, solemnly watch Curtis pass as
they stand guard over the captured, bound Soldiers.

Curtis, reaching the Gate, stops to look back at Gilliam.
Gilliam holds out his hand - palm up - in a gesture that says
“Go forward.” Curtis nods - goodbye. The other limbless
passengers (from Scene 8), stand behind Gilliam and wave.

YONA
No Chronole! No opening!

Curtis jumps a little, turning to Yona with her hand held
out; Namgoong stands by a wall panel ready to open the Gate.

INT. GREENHOUSE SECTION

WHOOSH - the Gate opens to reveal bright sunlight. Even the
ceiling is made of a special kind of glass. Full of
vegetation and plants, this Section is ludicrously clean;
everything is a pleasant, mind-cleansing green.

Curtis and his rag-tag Army enter slack-jawed at the vision.
TENDERS in white lab coats, are equally surprised to see
Mason bound and pushed forward.

TENDER 1
Mr. Minister!?

MASON
(feigning normalcy)
Don't mind me. Back to work,
everyone, back to work.

Curtis rapidly passes the Tenders to pluck a ripe tomato from
the overgrown shrubbery. He bites into it, sloppily tasting
the red juice and pulp. Turning around, he sees Tanya and
Andrew eating tomatoes as well.

Tenders become agitated but Mason assures them:

MASON (CONT’D)
No - no - they’re friendly. They
won't bite. Well, they’1ll bite the
tomatoes...ha!

Namgoong reaches into the tomato plants but pulls out a
fistful of black soil. He pushes it in front of Yona’s face.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 62.

YONA
You eat this too?
NAMGOONG
Touch it. You've never felt it

before?

Namgoong hands the soil to Yona who is unimpressed and
displeased. She looks carefully into the clump and notices
something tiny moving in it: a small worm.

YONA
Yeah, well, it’s gross.

NAMGOONG
You grew up in this train so you
don’t know. Dad used to tread on
real soil all the time.

YONA
Why would you walk on this gross
stuff?

NAMGOONG

C’mon, it’s good stuff. The earth
is covered with soil.

YONA
(not paying attention)
Like hell. It’s all snow and ice.

NAMGOONG
(looking outside the
window)
Below snow and ice is soil.
Everywhere you go.

FLASH - Namgoong is distracted by something outside through
the window. He presses his face to the window and stares at -
nothing. He looks and looks... He turns back to Yona.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Did you see...?

YONA
Wow! Look!

Yona runs to the opened gate. Through the gate we see:

29 INT. AQUARIUM SECTION

A huge aquarium with large fishes, a turtle and a rayfish
swimming in blue water with bubbles. Yona runs, excited,
into the section with joy.

Mason is shoved forward - like a shield. Curtis and the
others enter, flabbergasted to see the aquarium.
30

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 63.

FRONT SECTION PASSENGERS do a double take, seeing the armed
and ragged Curtis and his entourage, and move quickly away.
Mason, to diffuse awkwardness, turns to speak to Curtis.

MASON

Do any of you feel like sushi?
CURTIS
TANYA

Sushi? Hell, yea. Line that shit

up.

INT. AQUARIUM SECTION - SUSHI BAR

At the small sushi bar attached to the aquarium, a pitch
black AFRICAN CHEF makes sushi out of the fresh fish. Mason,
his hands tied to the front, sits at the bar with Curtis,
Andrew, Grey, Namgoong, Yona and Tanya, salivating.

MASON
You people are very lucky. This is
served only twice in a year, in
March and September.

TANYA
Why? Not enough fish?

MASON
“Enough” is the wrong criteria.
Balance. You see, this aquarium is
a closed ecological system. The
number of individual units must be
controlled very precisely to

maintain the proper sustainable
balance.

While Mason gives his lecture, sushi plates are laid:

Tanya and Andrew eat with gusto; Grey gingerly peels the fish
from the rice before eating; Namgoong uses chopsticks
skillfully; Yona, puzzled seeing sushi for the first time,
sniffs hers and makes a face.

Rachmaninoff’s piano prelude plays in b.g. Everyone silently
eats while watching the white snowy vista of a frozen port
city unfold outside: no one seems too surprised by the
peculiar sight of large vessels toppled in the frozen sea.

Mason attempts to eat sushi with tied hands. Curtis shoves a
protein block under Mason’s nose.

CURTIS
No - you eat this. You know what
this is made of?

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 64.

MASON

CURTIS
Just crap. Eat it - every last
scrap.

Mason, frozen, stares at the protein block with a blank face.
Suddenly, Tanya reaches over and snares Mason’s sushi and
gobbles it up.

INT. ABATTOIR SECTION

Curtis pushes Mason forward - he looks green, ready to vomit -
into this Section awash in red: rows and rows of scarlet,
skinned animals - curiously indistinct in terms of shape -

are suspended from the hooks.

Bizarrely, a MOTHER and BOY are sightseeing, the Mother
explaining what meat is. As Curtis and his Army pass, the
Boy recoils, wrinkles his nose. Mother hustles Boy away as
the Army proceeds in awe-struck silence to the next Gate.

MASON
Curtis, my friend, can we do
without the restraints? Just for
this next Section?

CURTIS
I am not your friend and why would
I...?

MASON

For the sake of education.

Curtis: “2?”

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

WHOOSH - the shouts and clamor of children playing pour out.
The CHILDREN are revealed disguised in colorful arts and
crafts masks. Above the cacophony, we hear the near-
hysterical shouts of TEACHER, a young adult woman.

TEACHER
Quiet! Children! Oh!
(noticing the arrival of
Mason and the Army)
Minister Mason?!

The CHILDREN fall quiet, turning their masked faces to the
Tail Section Rebels. Mason, concealing his bound hands
behind his back, pretends to be in charge.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 65.

MASON
Good morning children. I am
pleased to present guests from the
Tail Section...

Mason exchanges a look with Teacher - “I’m fucked but please
play along...”

TEACHER
Yes. Yes! Guests! What do we say
to Tail Section Guests, children?

CHILDREN
(sing-songy )
Good Morning Tail Section Guests...

Before the children can finish, Tanya and Andrew fall upon
them, rushing from child to child unmasking them to find
their sons. Tanya zeroes in on a child with black arms and
rips the mask off to reveal a small black girl.

TANYA
(showing the portrait)
Have you seen this boy? His name
is Timmy.

The shocked Black Girl, frightened, shakes her head and
bursts into tears.

ANDREW
This is my son. Take a good look
at the picture!

The children are unfocused, lost in their own excitements,
shouting and making noise. A white KID jumps up with a hand
raised.

KID
I saw them!

The Children fall silent as Tanya rushes to the Kid.

TANYA
When? Where?

The Kid regards Tanya and Andrew with interest, then speaks
slowly, pointing to the rear Gate:

KID
Came through there...
(then the Front Gate)
went through there.

Tanya and Andrew wait: “Is that all?”

TANYA
Were they crying?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 66.

KID
No...but they looked like they
wanted to.

Tanya bursts into tears and suddenly hugs the Kid. Kid is
overwhelmed by her body odor and holds his nose, rolling his
eyes. The other kids break out in laughter. Andrew,
weeping, gently pats Tanya’s back.

YLFA (8) a sweet little girl with blond pigtails waves her
hand at Teacher. She jumps up without being acknowledged...

YLFA
I heard all Tail Sectioners were
lazy dogs who slept all day in
their own shit.

TEACHER
(embarrassed)
Ylfa!

MASON
No - they’re very nice and they’re
very just and merciful. So it is.
(to Teacher: )
Please don’t let us interrupt...

TEACHER
We were just about to show a video.

Teacher herds the children back to their seats as Curtis
rounds up the bereft Tanya and Andrew to move on.

VIDEO NARRATOR (V.O.)
The Great Pioneer!

Curtis turns to the sound - a large TV Monitor comes to life
with a burst of theme music and a big splash of logo: WILFORD
ENTERPRISES. Wilford's face comes up - curiously, it is
digitally blurred.

CURTIS
Wilford?

VIDEO NARRATOR
The Wilford Story - the First 82
Years.

The Rebels are transfixed by the images. The Children squirm
- they have seen this before and are bored.

VIDEO NARRATOR (CONT’D)
From a very young age, Mr.
Wilford’s love of locomotives was
apparent...
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 67.

ON MONITOR: 8mm home-movie footage of Wilford (6) playing
with a bright Red Toy Engine. He makes “choo choo” noises,
then holds the Engine up and shouts in a cute voice.

WILFORD
When I grow up, I want to live ina
train. Forever!

VIDEO NARRATOR
His early dreams were realized when
he founded his own transportation
empire - the Wilford Enterprises.

Wilford (about 40), face blurred, stands in front of a
massive building bearing his name.

VIDEO NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But his greatest dream was to
construct a luxury locomotive
‘cruise' line connecting the
railways of the entire world into
one!

A world map shows railway lines snaking across and connecting
into one tremendous circle, like an Ouroboros worm eating its
own tail.

VIDEO NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A circular railway that extends for
438,000 kilometers and completes
one circle every year. Impervious
to the extreme cold of the Arctic
and the scorching heat of the
African desert...

The train runs through various landscapes, from a desert to a
snow-bound plain to a jungle, shown in rapid montage.

VIDEO NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Wilford’s Miracle Train is self-
sustaining and possesses the most
sophisticated designs and advanced
technology known to man.

Wilford (60), face blurred, shakes hands with engineers and
corporate heads. Namgoong Minsoo, 20 years younger in a
“Kyungnam Engineering” uniform, is glimpsed briefly.
Namgoong pokes Yona but she misses the moment, yawning.

Curtis stares intently at the screen trying to decipher the
digital blur of Wilford’s image as Teacher stops the video
with a remote. The screen is covered with a PAUSE sign.

TEACHER
As hard as it is to believe, people
in the Old World made fun of Mr.
Wilford.

(MORE )
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 68.

TEACHER (CONT'D)
They criticized him for over-
engineering and over-equipping this
wonderful train. But Wilford knew
something they did not. And what
was that?

Several Children raise their hands. Teacher is about to
acknowledge one when Ylfa jumps up.

YLFA
Old World people were frigging
morons who got turned into
popsicles!

TEACHER
Well, sort of. Mr. Wilford knew
that CW-7 would freeze the world.
So what did the prophetic Mr.
Wilford invent to protect the
chosen from that calamity?

CHILDREN
(in a chorus)
THE ENGINE!

Curtis and the others watch, bewildered, as Teacher strikes a
chord on a small organ. The Children suddenly jump to their
feet startling Rebels who, thinking they are under attack,
pull their weapons.

GIRLS BOYS
(singing) (singing)
Rumble Rumble Rattle Rattle

CHILDREN (CONT’D)
It will never die!

Curtis gestures for the Rebels to lower their weapons. Mason
smiles broadly, his foot tapping away. Teacher plays along
though some keys no longer work.

TEACHER
(singing)
What happens if the engine stops?

CHILDREN
We all freeze and die.
GIRLS BOYS
But will it stop? No!
GIRLS BOYS
Oh will it stop? No!
TEACHER

Can you tell us why?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 69.

BOYS GIRLS
The engine is eternal! Yes!

BOYS GIRLS
The engine is forever! Yes!

TEACHER (CONT’D)
Who is the reason why?

GIRLS BOYS
Wilford! Yea!
BOYS GIRLS
Wilford! Yea!
TEACHER/MASON

Wilford! Wilford!

ALL
Hip hooray!

Mason joins in the cheering at the end. Curtis, no longer
able to stomach this nonsense, gives him a violent push.

HOOOOT - a whistle from the far off front blows. Children
run to the windows. The Rebels are again bewildered.

TEACHER
Don’t push there’s plenty of room.
Who can tell me what comes after
Yekaterina Bridge?

KID
(shouting out:)
The Frozen Seven!

The Children, truly excited, press against the windows.
Namgoong, surprisingly follows suit, dragging Yona to look at
an expansive blinding whiteness.

TEACHER
Pay attention. This tableau will
surely be on the exam!

Curtis and the Rebels wander over behind the children.

TEACHER (CONT’D)

Fifteen years ago, in the 3rd year
of the train, seven passengers...

(gets incredibly excited)
tried to STOP Wilford’s Miracle
Train!

(visibly calms down)
And what do we call this event,
Magdalena?
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 70.

MAGDALENA
The Revolt of the Seven.

TEACHER
Very good - long before you were
born. But of course, they failed
to stop the train. Instead, they
jumped out of the running train.
Here they come now.

NAMGOONG
You look too.

YONA
Why?

A huge hill comes into view. And on the back of the hill,
seven snowman-shaped white lumps are clearly visible.

Yona regards the Frozen Seven with curiosity.

TEACHER
There they are. That’s how far
they made it. What happened to
them, Sergio?

SERGIO
They froze and died.

TEACHER
(excited)
So, everyone! If we ever go
outside the train?

CHILDREN
We'd freeze and die!
TEACHER
If the engine stops running?
CHILDREN
We'd all die!
TEACHER
Who takes care of the Sacred
Engine?
CHILDREN

Sir Wilford!

TEACHER
Because all life is here - aboard
the train, within the great embrace
of Sir Wilford. And nothing can
live outside the train.

rays reflecting on the hill illuminate her and Namgoong’s

faces.

The white sun-

NAMGOONG
See the person at the very front...
She was the leader of the seven...

YONA
She?
NAMGOONG
Yeah... She was a maid in the

Front Guest Section...

YONA
You knew her?

NAMGOONG
Gana. She was Inuit. An Eskimo.
She taught me about different kinds
of snow, ice, constellations and
aurora. Her name meant falling
snow. Gana.

YONA
Gana.

NAMGOONG
She believed she could survive
outside the train. I didn’t
believe her. So I stayed in the
train.

Yona looks at the lead frozen figure... Namgoong transfixed
by the sight of the Frozen Seven receding into the distance.
Yona’s ears perk up at approaching sounds - too late...

WHOOSH - the front gate opens. The Rebels whirl around,
drawing their weapons only to find a single, bald Asian man
enter. EGG-HEAD, his head shaped like an egg, pushes a cart
full of baskets of white eggs.

Teacher herds the children towards Egg-Head’s cart.

TEACHER
Look children! It’s the New Year
Eggs from Mr. Wilford!

The Children cheer and surround Egg-Head and his full basket
of hard boiled eggs colorfully decorated with the Number 18
in various alphabets: Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, etc.

TEACHER (CONT’D)
New beginnings! New Life!

Egg-Head hands out a big basket full of boiled eggs to
Teacher who hands them out to the Children. Tanya pushes her
way to the front of the line.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 72.

TEACHER (CONT’D)

These eggs are boiled in water
heated by the Sacred Engine itself.
See? They’re still warm.

Egg-Head gives an egg to Curtis and pushes his cart out the
Back Gate.

TEACHER (CONT’D)

As a special treat, playing for us
today is world-renowned first chair
violinist of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, Mr. Gerald McInster!

Gerald, in old formal attire, enters (he was the one dragged
off in Scene # 3). He plays a violin with only one string:
Bach’s “Aria in G String.”

ON TV MONITOR: “Pause” gives way to CCTV video footage of Egg-
Head passing out eggs in the Abattoir and Aquarium Sections.

VIDEO NARRATOR (V.O.)
«+-join live coverage of the 18th
Annual Egg Festival...

As Children listen to the beautiful (if incomplete) violin,
Curtis holds his egg as if he were making contact with
Wilford. Tanya smacks the egg onto Ylfa’s head to crack it
open.

TANYA
(peeling the egg)
Let’s go, Curtis. To the Front.
CURTIS cuts her off. His attention is riveted on his egg.

TANYA (CONT'D)
I'll eat that if you aren't.

Curtis locates a pinhole at the bottom of the egg. He pulls
the egg apart and a small metal capsule falls out.

INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION

EGG-HEAD’S POV: as the gate opens with a rumble, he comes
face-to-face with Painter and the Tail Section Guards. They
look at Egg-Head’s smiling face suspiciously.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

Curtis unrolls the Red Letter: “B L O O D”

SNAP - the last remaining violin string breaks and the music

stops. The snapped string cuts Gerald’s cheek, drawing
blood. Curtis, overcome with dread, looks at the Monitor:

ON MONITOR: Egg-Head steps through the Gate bearing an egg.

INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION - ENTRANCE
Painter looks at the egg in his hand and mumbles:

PAINTER
I thought the chicken was extinct.

EGG-HEAD
Rumors. You know, there are many
things on board that are rumored to
be extinct.

PAINTER
Such as?

Egg-Head reaches beneath the eggs and pulls out a sub-machine
gun!

EGG-HEAD
This.

Painter raises his sketch pad like a shield.

ON SKETCH PAD: Drawing of Curtis standing atop the protein
block cart heroically leading the charge; in the drawing,
Painter himself is seen by the side, sketching...

BLAM - BLAM - BLAM - the sub-machine gun blasts fire tearing
apart the drawing and, as it drops, we see Painter, riddled
with bullet holes. He falls.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

Curtis watches the Monitor in horror as Rebel Guards are cut
down by the machine gun fire.

CURTIS
Nol!

Teacher pulls a handgun and a magazine from her basket.

TEACHER
Duck!

Mason dives for cover as Teacher opens fire.

BLAM - Andrew, just behind Curtis, is shot through the head.
The children scream and run to find cover.

BLAM - BLAM - Teacher swings the gun to aim at Curtis.
Grey, pushing Tanya out of the way, pitches the dagger at

Teacher burying it in her throat. She drops the gun and it
skitters away. The children’s shrill screams continue.
37

38

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 74.

Teacher, stunned, reaches for her throat and yanks the dagger
out. Blood runs crimson down her neck from the dagger’s
hole. As Curtis approaches her, she snatches up Ylfa and
holds her as a human shield - placing the dagger against
Ylfa’s throat...

TEACHER (CONT'D)
(rasping through a
punctured larynx)

Stay back. Don’t make me...

But she runs out of breath and faints. Teacher falls to the
floor; the dagger in her hand pierces her heart.

Mason quickly lunges for the fallen gun but Curtis kicks him
down. Curtis takes up the gun and smashes him with it on the
head. Blood gushes out from Mason’s head.

Tanya cries out, holding Andrew's dead body in her arms.

INT. WATER SUPPLY SECTION

Egg-Head easily dodges flying hand-axes as he moves forward
firing. Rebel Guards fall in his wake, covered in blood. In
his non-shooting hand, Egg-Head clicks a counter.

Egg-Head aims at the ropes binding the Soldiers. Freed
Soldiers run to their comrades and untie them. A Soldier
kicks over the cart. Eggs roll everywhere. Under the cart
are more sub-machine guns and magazines.

Soldiers quickly pick up weapons and fire: flames jump from
the guns, staccato ear-splitting sound of gunshots, screams
of the Guards as they are punched full of red holes!

Painter lies on the floor bleeding. An egg rolls in front of
him and he softly picks it up. CRUNCH - he barely takes a
bite as his breath runs out.

CLICK-CLICK-CLICK - Egg-head’s thumb on the counter.

Guards run wildly in retreat towards the back of the Section.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

Curtis' attention is riveted on the huge Monitor. Grey
slides up beside him, his eyes on the screen.

ON MONITOR: in grimy, low-resolution the Water Supply Section
appears as a wasteland. An old man is dragged out from the
back of the Section by two Soldiers. It is Gilliam.

Curtis and Grey turn deathly pale. Curtis holds his breath.

ON MONITOR: Soldiers, aware of the camera's position, force
Gilliam to kneel facing it. One pulls his head up.

39

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 75.

Gilliam looks into the camera - calm, composed, resigned - he
reaches out his one arm.

Curtis is about to run toward the rear gate but cannot take
his eyes off Gilliam. Grey moves to the Monitor as if he
could climb into it.

ON MONITOR: Arm extended, Gilliam turns his palm up - he
mouths “I am sorry." Franco the Elder enters the frame. He
aims a pistol at the back of Gilliam's head and pulls the
trigger.

CURTIS
NO!!!

Grey screams silently. He reaches out to touch the Monitor.

ON MONITOR: Gilliam gently tumbles to the ground. Franco the
Elder looks up at the camera.

Yona looks back at Franco’s empty gaze. Her face turns pale
in fear and outrage.

Grey slumps to the floor. He pulls out the stolen child's
mask and puts it on his face to hide his tears. The mask is
incongruously, a sunny, happy face.

Curtis' face goes blank - he is frozen, staring at the
Monitor that now fizzes out to snowy static. Tanya releases
Andrew and stands before Curtis. Beat. She slaps him.

TANYA
Curtis! Come on! You have to lead
us.

Curtis snaps out of it. He pulls the handgun from his belt
and strides towards the fallen, bleeding Mason.

MASON
It wasn’t me! I didn’t give the
order! I swear...

Curtis places the barrel of the gun to Mason’s forehead and
pulls the trigger.

BLAM - Curtis strides to the desk and snatches up a magazine
from the basket. He reloads the handgun.

CURTIS
We go forward!

Egg-Head leads the majority of Soldiers back towards the Tail
Section. But Franco the Elder and two Soldiers run the
opposite way - towards the front.

INT. PRISON SECTION - ENTRANCE

Tail Section Passengers, panicking, run from the sound of
approaching gunfire. In the stampede, Chan quickly moves up
to the higher spot.

CHAN'S POV: the flashing light of gunfire is seen behind the
rush of Passengers. Egg-Head and Soldiers appear pushing the
Passengers ahead with gunfire coming closer...

INT. GUEST ROOM SECTION

Curtis, with a fierce rage now, leads Tanya and Grey, wearing
his mask, down a corridor of extravagant guestrooms. FRONT
SECTION GUARDS approaching from the opposite side shrink away
with fear. One Guard, at the Gate, holds his ground.

NAMGOONG
(in Korean)
OPEN!

YONA
(in English)
OPEN!

Guard, trembling, places his palm on a small panel which
opens the Gate. Curtis, violently pushes the Guard away and
leads the others through. Namgoong reaches into Curtis'
pocket to take two lumps of Chronole.

Curtis stares at him with disbelief: “This guy still wants
that shit at this time?”

Curtis strides past rows of guest rooms containing milky-
white elderly people: a dentist cleans someone’s teeth, a Man
eats steak, a Woman gets a manicure, a couple plays cards...

Through their windows or open doors, GUESTS stare with
disbelief at Curtis passing through their luxurious, carefree
lives. Curtis, disgusted, hurries past without comment.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

Franco and the two Soldiers herd the crying Children into the
next section as the train makes a wide turn toward the right.

FRANCO’S POV: through the window, Front Sections are visible
as the train bends widely, almost forming a big circle.
Curtis' small team is visible in the Front Section.

Franco aims the rifle at Yona’s head and fires.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 77.

INT. SWIMMING POOL SECTION

BANG - CRACK - the bullet breaks through the two panes of
Plexiglass window but, its trajectory is altered and it
barely misses Yona's head. Strands of her hair, sliced by
the bullet, flutter in the air.

YONA

CURTIS
Everybody down!

The floor-to-ceiling windows, however, provide little
protection. Front Section Passengers, who were enjoying
their swimming, scream and come out of the pool, running this
way and that.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION

Franco sets his rifle across a chair placed on a desk before
the window - in full sniper mode. Soldier A runs from bullet
hole to bullet hole trying to plug them with Children’s
paste. Soldier B stands by - shocked:

SOLDIER B
Hey! Don’t you know the firearm
regulations? To minimize damage
to...

Franco smashes Soldier B in the face with the rifle butt.
Soldier B drops like road-kill.

BLAM - BLAM - Franco fires through the window. Soldier A
jumps aside and runs...

The train now swirls in a big circle, shaking intensely.

INT. SCHOOL SECTION/SWIMMING POOL SECTION - INTERCUT

BLAM - BLAM - shots hit the glass - most bouncing off and
leaving ugly pock marks surrounded by spider web cracks above
the heads of Yona, Namgoong and the others flat on the floor.

Curtis rises and shoots at the faraway School Section.
Curtis and Franco square off like gunslingers in a Western,
firing at each other as the curvature of the train becomes
more acute.

BLAM - Curtis' bullet penetrates the window and hits Franco
in the arm. Franco stops shooting. He looks at the blood on
his arm and then across at Curtis. Curtis reloads and fires.
Franco comes out of his trance and returns fire.

A snowflake gently flies into the train through a bullet
hole. It flutters in the air softly in slow motion.
46

47

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 78.

The gunfire and all sound fades away. Namgoong’s eyes follow
the falling snowflake as it lands on Yona’s shoulder.

NAMGOONG’S POV: the exquisite hexagon shape of the snow
crystal in extreme close up, as if through a microscope.
Then it melts away...

NAMGOONG
Gana.

BLAM - BLAM - the firing resumes, breaking the stillness.
Tanya’s earsplitting screams overlap the gunshots.

A BULLET breaks through the first pane of Plexiglass coming
straight at Curtis' face. Curtis’ eyes widen - the BULLET
gets stopped by the second pane but remains embedded in the
window just inches in front of Curtis’ face.

The train finally straightens out from its sharp turn.
Franco and Curtis grow further and further apart until the
train runs on a straight track once again.

Curtis, breathing hard, drops the gun that has run out of
bullets. Yona rises to her knees.

YONA
Coming! Three of them!

Curtis snaps to attention. Namgoong joins Curtis running to
the back Gate to jam it shut. Namgoong hastily attacks the
electronic controls of the Gate.

INT. GUEST ROOM SECTION

Soldiers A and B try to open the jammed Gate. Franco,
without human expression, comes up behind and opens fire on
the locked Gate. The Soldiers dive out of the way and roll.

SOLDIER B
What the fuck...?!

Franco fires until the Gate begins to teeter...

INT. SAUNA SECTION

WHOOSH - the front Gate opens just as Franco kicks the back
Gate inward. Curtis and his last Rebels rush through the
Gate and Namgoong closes it behind them.

The Rebels hurry past steam-bath units as the sound of Franco
firing on the Gate behind is heard. Namgoong sets to work on
the next Gate but becomes agitated as he is having trouble.
Namgoong sees a crowbar on the wall above the panel. He
grabs it and attacks the controls.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 79.

CURTIS
Hurry!

NAMGOONG
Shit, what’s wrong with this? *
Fuck...

Steam Bath CLIENTELE glance at the Rebels through opaque
glass doors.

CUT TO:

FRANCO’S POV: as he kicks down the Gate and enters. In the
thick steam, the Section appears empty.

Franco and the two Soldiers move cautiously forward. A face
flashes behind one of the steam-bath units.

BLAM - BLAM - Franco fires instinctively. The door swings
open and a ROTUND WHITE MAN rolls out, with his naked lower
body hidden by a white towel, bleeding profusely.

SOLDIER B
You just killed a Front Section
Passenger! I’m reporting you to...

BLAM - Franco blows Soldier B away. Soldier A, astonished,
lifts up his hands in the air.

SOLDIER A
I didn’t see a thing.

CLICK - Franco pulls the trigger but he is out of bullets.

Grey, masked, jumps out of a steam-bath unit, knocking
Soldier A away, and stabs at Franco’s neck with the dagger.
Franco's animal-like reflexes are too fast and the dagger
only catches his shoulder. He drops his rifle.

Curtis jumps out of another steam-bath unit, stomps on fallen *
Soldier A and takes his gun. He aims at Franco but his
target is intertwined with Grey in a deadly struggle.

Franco roars as he lifts Grey and spins him in a complete
circle, like a human windmill, so his mask goes flying away.
He throws Grey to the metal floor. GREY is knocked out.

BLAM - BLAM - Curtis fires and Franco drops to the ground
where he retrieves the fallen rifle of Soldier B.

Curtis and Franco fire at one another. Curtis' hand is
nicked by a bullet and he loses the gun. Franco aims his
rifle at Curtis' head.

Tanya comes roaring out of a steam-bath unit behind Franco.

TANYA
Ahhhhhh! You son of a bitch!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 80.

Franco swings the rifle around but is too late as Tanya uses
her heft to drive both the rifle and Franco backwards.

BLAM - Franco fires right into Tanya’s gut as she pushes him
against the wall.

CURTIS
Tanya!

Tanya, face to face with Franco, is surprised she is shot -
they are stuck together like dancers with the rifle between.

TANYA
Timmy.

Tanya collapses to the floor at Franco’s feet. Franco swings
the rifle to shoot Curtis. Curtis, face contorted with rage,
charges straight at Franco.

CLICK - the rifle is empty. Curtis dives at Franco who
catches his leg mid-air and throws him down like a rag doll.

CRUNCH - Curtis' head bangs on a metal ornament on the wall
and he instantly passes out next to Grey, blood coming from
the side of his head.

Franco pulls the dagger from his shoulder. He grabs Curtis'
shirt and pulls him up. He rears back to stab Curtis when
Grey suddenly comes awake and blocks Franco’s thrust.

The dagger goes straight through Grey’s hand - it’s tip
stopping just inches from Curtis' neck. The dagger has
pierced Grey’s tattoo: “Goodbye”

Grey, snake quick, puts his legs around Franco’s neck. He
performs a Judo maneuver spinning Franco around to the floor.
They struggle but Grey, with his hand stabbed, cannot fight
Franco off.

Franco twists Grey’s wrist so the dagger presses into his
chest. Grey emits an animal-like moan:

GREY
Ugggggh!

As Grey clutches at his chest, the dagger pierces on the
tattoo over his heart: “Gilliam.” Franco looks down into
Grey’s pale eyes. Franco presses down on the dagger and
shoves it into Grey’s heart.

Franco hears a girl coughing. His eyes widen - he turns to
survey the carnage - Soldier B, Grey, Curtis, Tanya - all
down. Franco removes a knife from a sheath on Soldier B’s
belt. He opens each steam-bath unit.

On the second try, he finds the unit occupied by a very
heavyset ITALIAN WOMAN, draped with an equally humongous
towel. She looks back at him with fear-stricken eyes.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 81.

Franco moves to the next unit, but suddenly stops. He comes
back and looks the Italian Woman up and down - something
unnatural about her sitting posture.

Franco flattens the knife’s blade on Italian Woman’s cheek
and pushes it to the side to reveal one of Yona's doe-eyes,
below wet hair and sweat-drenched brow. And poking out
behind her is Namgoong’s right eye.

Franco stares at Yona for a moment with a cold and murderous
look in his eyes. He lifts the knife and brings it down with
heaven-cleaving force.

CLANG - sparks fill the air as Namgoong’s crowbar stops the
descent of Franco's knife.

NAMGOONG
AAAAAHHHH!

Namgoong impossibly pushes both the Italian Woman and Franco
out of the unit. He brings down the crowbar down on Franco’s
head. The Italian Woman waddles away as fast as she can.

Franco swings his knife but Namgoong dodges it. With a
rhino’s strength, Namgoong head-butts Franco. Both men lose
their weapons. They struggle and thrash on the floor.

Franco gets his hands around Namgoong’s neck and strangles.
Namgoong’s face turns beet-red but, not giving up, he gets
his hands on Franco’s neck and strangles.

Yona approaches silently and takes up the fallen knife. Yona
swings the knife. THUMP - Namgoong removes one hand from
Franco’s neck and grabs Yona’s wrist. He holds on tight -
intent on keeping Yona from committing violence. Franco
chokes harder - Namgoong is about to pass out.

The knife wavers in the air - Namgoong holding Yona’s wrist
immobile. The knife is suddenly yanked from Yona’s hand - by
Curtis, bleeding, weak, pale - but awake and determined.

Curtis, in a swift motion, strikes - plunging the knife into
Franco’s side.

FRANCO THE ELDER
Aaaaah!

Franco releases Namgoong’s neck who falls back choking as he
tries to get his breath back. Yona runs to help him.

Franco turns to look into Curtis' eyes. Curtis twists the
knife in his side. Franco blinks, then collapses. Curtis
falls back, exhausted.

A moist silence envelopes the Sauna Section broken by Tanya,
still alive, holding the blood and guts in her stomach. With
great difficulty:
48

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 82.

TANYA
Where’s...my...Timmy?

CURTIS
We'll find him when we get...

TANYA
No, no...my...picture...

Curtis looks around at the bloody mess - no portrait. He
stands and looks in the unit Tanya was hiding in and finds
the portrait on the floor. He snatches it up.

Yona strokes Tanya’s head - comforting her as Curtis returns.

CURTIS
I found it.

Tanya’s eyes overflow with tears. Curtis kneels and holds
out the portrait. But Tanya does not take it. Instead she
pushes it back to Curtis.

TANYA
You... Curtis...

Tanya exhales - she dies. Curtis closes his eyes - feeling
the pain of losing too many friends. He opens his eyes and
looks down at the portrait of Timmy.

CUT TO:

INT. PASSAGE

Curtis moves along a dark and narrow passage filled with the
loud noise of a nearby machine. Blood from his hand wound
rolls down and drips to the metal floor.

INT. CLUB SECTION

CLUBBERS in bizarre make-up dance under colorful blinking
lights to loud throbbing music, rowdy shouting and
laughter...

WHOOSH - Namgoong and Yona enter carrying empty rifles with
bloodied Curtis on their side. Clubbers find them odd, but
keep dancing. Curtis has no interest in anything but the
next Gate.

A LADY spots Curtis and stops dancing. Her eyes track
Curtis.

LADY
(surprised)
Curtis? CURTIS!!
50

51

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 83.

The Lady yells in vain as her voice is drowned out by the
loud thumps of the club music.

LADY'S POV: the back of the Curtis’ head as he moves far away
to the front of the club.

Yona has fun aiming her rifle at Clubbers and making
threatening gestures. She grabs a bottle of alcohol ona
table and gulps it as she walks.

YONA’'S POV: naked couples, kissing, hugging, and making love
to each other are seen here and there in the shadows.

Namgoong sees a WOMAN sniffing Chronole, pierced at the end
of luxurious silver knife. He grabs her chin:

NAMGOONG
(in Korean)
Where did you get this from?

YONA
Where did you get this?

INT. OPIUM DEN SECTION

Yona, drunk and shouting gibberish, follows Namgoong through
the unhealthy smoke of this garish den of marble floors,
sculptures and littered with lumps of Chronole and ADDICTS.

Many Addicts are “fashionably” dressed in Inuit fur coats
over bare skin. Namgoong swings his rifle, smashing the
Addicts down and taking all their Chronole.

Namgoong beats an Addict and takes his Inuit fur coat. The
Addict’s skinny, naked body falls to the floor with a thump.
Namgoong shakes the coat and lumps of Chronole fall to the
floor like nuts.

Namgoong drapes the coat over his shoulder. He picks up
every lump of Chronole. The Addict, behind, tries to grab
Namgoong but Yona conks him with her rifle butt.

Namgoong pulls the coat off another addict. The Naked Woman
Addict grabs the coat and they engage in a tug-of-war.

Curtis keeps moving forward straight through the murky smoke
drawn to a plate above the next Gate: Wilford Enterprises.
INT. PASSAGE

We hear laboured breathing in the dark and narrow passage.

The camera slowly moves to the side to reveal Franco walking
straight ahead, expressionless with grotesque fish eyes.
52

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 84.

He gets snagged on something on the wall. He looks numbly
down at the knife sticking out his side. He grasps it with
both hands and pulls it out, his face still expressionless.

CUT TO:

INT. MACHINERY SECTION

CLANG - a Gate opens and Curtis enters to find a narrow
bridge stretching above a mass of unmanned machinery.
Namgoong enters bearing a stack of Inuit fur coats. Yona, in
a coat, follows - they laugh and stumble.

Curtis crosses the bridge. Namgoong and Yona follow but,
upon reaching the other side, drop down on the steel platform
below the next Gate. Yona, drunk as a skunk, flops over and
snores hard clutching her bottle and rifle.

Namgoong shakes the coats to release all the Chronole and
tosses the coats away into a heap. He sits and gathers all
the Chronole on the floor.

NAMGOONG
Isn't this crazy?

Namgoong sticks the lumps together into one big piece. He
takes out the Interpretive Unit and pushes the button.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
CURRIS... Just gimme all of your
Chronole now.

CURTIS

NAMGOONG
Aren’t you sick of it? Every
fucking door it’s two more stinking
pieces...

Curtis, disgusted, throws all the Chronole lumps at Namgoong.
The lumps hit Namgoong’s face and body and roll on the floor.

CURTIS
Chronole!? There. That’s all of
it. Now open the gate.

NAMGOONG
(giggles)
Son of a bitch, keep your temper

down.

Namgoong picks up all the Chronole pieces and then glances up
at the Gate - it is the most intimidating yet.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 85.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
So I open this door and your sacred
engine will sit on the other side,
waiting for you, is that it? Your
heart is beating hard imagining
Wilford rubbing it and feeding oil
to it, right?

Curtis murderously stares at Namgoong being sarcastic.

CURTIS
What do you know? All you care
about is your Chronole supply.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
Trash like you would never
understand what it means for us,
coming all the way from the Tail
Section to the front, to be
standing at this gate... After 18
fucking years, I’m finally face to
face with Wilford... You have no
idea how long I’ve wanted this.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
You ever been to the Tail Section?
Do you even know what went on back
there?

Amidst the sound of machinery, Namgoong loses his sarcasm and
stares directly at Curtis.

CURTIS (CONT'D)

No? Chaos. Total fucking chaos
when we boarded. Fine - we didn’t
freeze to death but we didn’t even
have time to be thankful before the
Soldiers - Wilford’s Soldiers -
came and took everything edible
from the storage crates. Left us
with nothing.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
More than a thousand people in an
empty iron box with no water, no
bread, nothing. Can you imagine?
No, you can’t.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 86.

Eventually becoming absorbed in the story, Namgoong's face
begins to take on a similar expression to Curtis'.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
After three weeks, we began to eat
the weak.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
We were hungry. We stopped being
humans. We became animals. Do you
know what I hate the most about
myself? I fucking hate that I know
what part of a human tastes good.
I know that young babies taste the
best.

As Curtis' voice begins to shake, Namgoong's gaze
intensifies.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
There was a woman in the Tail

Section who had a little baby. One *
day, some men with knives, pulled *
the baby out of his mother’s arms.

Put a fucking knife to his skull.

And then. And then an old man

stepped forward. No relation -

just an old man...

NAMGOONG

Curtis puts his hand out, palm up, like Gilliam.

CURTIS
“Give me the knife,” he said.
Everyone thought he’d kill the baby
himself. The man with the knife
gave it up. Then, the old man cut
off his own arm. “Here.” Held it
up. His arm.

+e * HF

NAMGOONG

Curtis holds out his palm - open.

CURTIS
“Here. Eat this! You are so
hungry. Eat this. Leave the boy.
Eat this.”

NAMGOONG
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 87.

CURTIS
I couldn't believe what I saw, it
was the most shocking thing I’ve
ever witnessed. Two days later, he
cut off his own leg. Same thing.
“Eat this. Here. Take it.”

Again - the open palm.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
You've probably guessed who that
old man was.

NAMGOONG
Gilliam...

CURTIS

The little baby was Edgar.

(face hardens)
And I was the man with the knife.
I would have killed that baby boy.
My Edgar. My number two. Gilliam
saved him. That was the most
important day of my life. After
that, everything changed. I
followed him. We all did. All of a
sudden, we became human again. One
by one, people began to follow his
example, offering their arm or
their leg. It was some kind of a
miracle Gilliam created.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
Those who gave their arm or leg
became legends in the Tail Section.
I wanted to be one of them but...
I...

Curtis pauses. He looks down at his arm with anguish:

CURTIS (CONT'D)
A couple weeks later, the gate
opened. Wilford’s Soldiers brought
us protein blocks... We’ve been
eating that shit ever since. But,
because of Gilliam we were able to
endure the last 18 years. And now
I am right in front of Wilford’s
door. This is what I’ve been
waiting for. This day. This
moment.

(a plea)
Open the gate.

Namgoong stares at Curtis. He takes the cigarette and
matchbook out of his shoes. He throws them to Curtis.

NAMGOONG
Here, have a smoke.

CURTIS

NAMGOONG
It's the last of its kind. Once
you smoke it, it goes extinct. You
better appreciate it.

Curtis smiles in spite of himself. He sits across from
Namgoong and opens the matchbook - two matches. He takes one
and lights the cigarette. He inhales deeply.

CURTIS
...open the gate.

NAMGOONG
I don’t want to open the gate.
(dead serious)
You know what I really want to do?

Curtis does not answer - he looks at the smoke as he blows it
out. Namgoong suddenly sits up straighter.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
I want to open the gate!

Curtis shakes his head - he doesn’t understand and he is
tired of Namgoong. Namgoong points.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Not this one.

Namgoong turns to his left and points to the exit door on the
side of the train:

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
But, that one.

ANGLE - AN EXIT DOOR on the side of the train.
This is the first time anyone even mentioned that there is A

SIDE EXIT to every section of the train. Namgoong moves
slowly to the door as if being pulled on a rope.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 89.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
We treat this like a wall because
it’s been frozen shut for 18 years.
But it’s a door. A fucking door!

Namgoong’s eyes become dreamy, almost hallucinatory.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Let’s open it and go outside.

CURTIS
And freeze to death? You're
fucking crazy.

Staring at Curtis, Namgoong reaches down to pick up a thrown
coat. He begins to put it on.

NAMGOONG
Yea? But what if we don't freeze
to death?
CURTIS
You freak.
NAMGOONG
What if we can live outside the

train?

Curtis, lost for words, stares at Namgoong putting on the
coat.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Heehee...you remember the
Yekaterina Bridge? Each year when
we pass over the Yekaterina Bridge,
I do the same thing. I look
down...

CURTIS
You were fucking high as a kite...

INSERT - Scene # 21. Namgoong carrying Yona on his
shoulders, walking towards the window.

NAMGOONG (V.O.)
Way down at the bottom of the
gorge...

Namgoong and Yona press their cheeks to the glass window and
look into the dark gorge.

Namgoong pressed against the glass looking down, believing.

disbelieving Curtis. Curtis pulls back, shaking his head.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
It’s melting. The snow and ice are
melting.

CURTIS
No fucking way, you're a lunatic.

INSERT - Scene # 45: a single snowflake flutters onto Yona's
shoulder. An extreme close-up, as if seen through a
microscope, of the beautiful crystallized hexagon.

NAMGOONG (V.O.)

Eskimos talk about "qanika", the
prototypical shape of spring snow.
Snow that's about to melt! All
this snow could come crashing down
any day!

ON YONA - snoring, her mouth hanging open.

ON NAMGOONG whose dreamy trance is suddenly broken. He jumps
up and shouts.

NAMGOONG
Today! Today, do you know what I
saw?!

INSERT - Scene # 28: Namgoong is distracted by something
outside the window. He looks and looks...

NAMGOONG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(voice rising, excited)

I saw something out there. I don’t

know what. Something moving.

NAMGOONG’S POV: between hills far away, something quickly
passes by - too fast, too blurry to have true shape...

ON NAMGOONG’s, eyes crazed, as he pulls on yet another coat.

Something alive.

CURTIS
You know what you saw? Wishes.
Frozen fucking phantom wishes.

NAMGOONG

CURTIS
You should go easy on the Chronole.
Look what it’s done to you!

Namgoong looks blankly at the brick-size lump of Chronole in
his hands.

NAMGOONG
(vaguely)
It's been two years now that I've
been storing up this Chronole...

CURTIS
Great. Open my gate and you can
snort that fucking brick of
flammable waste up into your
skull...

NAMGOONG
(grinning like an idiot)
Yes! Flammable. It is flammable
industrial waste...

CURTIS
Fine. Whatever. Open...

Namgoong pulls a WICK out of his pocket. Curtis is
flabbergasted.

NAMGOONG
It is a BOMB, you fuckhead!

Curtis' mouth drops open in shock. He drops the cigarette
and stomps on it afraid of its fire.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
(dreamily)
There's no door?... I'1l make one.

Namgoong drifts towards the door as he sticks the wick in the
Chronole brick. Curtis jumps up - alarmed - and stuffs the
matchbook in his pocket.

CURTIS
No! You crazy fuck! If you wanna
freeze to death, be my guest, but
don’t fuck up my revolution!

Look at this guy... Shut up and
give me the matches.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 92.

No way. No fucking way...

NAMGOONG
FIRE! I NEED FIRE!

WHOOSH - the steel gate suddenly opens...

BLAM - and a gunshot echoes. Namgoong is shot in the stomach
and drops to the floor with a yell. Claude enters in her
high heels and severe attire. She descends steps to Curtis -
putting her gun away.

CLAUDE
Curtis Everett. I have been asked
to extend...

Namgoong tries to rise, moaning.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
Stay where you are. We’1l deal
with you later.

Namgoong is too shocked to move. Claude sees the Chronole
brick. She uses her ruler to measure it. THWAK. She puts
the bomb in her overcoat. She takes the rifle.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
(to Curtis)

--. a formal invitation from Mr.

Wilford to join him for dinner.

Follow me.

Claude clicks up the stairs. A shocked Curtis follows. He
shoots a look back at Nam just before...

WHOOOSH - the Gate closes. Namgoong, moaning, checks his
wound. Yona snores - she has slept through everything.

INT. ENGINE SECTION

Curtis looks around in awe at the jungle of metal parts:
twisted pipes intertwined with machines like vines on a
trellis. The heat generated from these machines is
oppressive. The percolating sound is booming.

A massive boulder of metal dominates the Section: the Engine.

WILFORD (0.S.)
Curtis? Is that you?

Curtis searches for the source of the voice: his back to
Curtis and Claude, an old man cooks on a plate heated by the
hot boulder of metal. He turns to Curtis. WILFORD.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 93.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
(kindly smile, warm)
Curtis, dear boy, there you are.
Come in. Let’s have a look at you.

Claude leads him to Wilford. She points to a chair at a
table by the Stove, elegantly set for dinner for two.
Wilford sautes potatoes on a skillet.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
Hungry?
(Curtis is silent)
You did a man’s work coming all
this way.

Curtis glances at Wilford. He is just an old white man.
Claude takes up a high stool separate from the table.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
You are the first human to have
walked the total length of this
train. Tail to Engine. Did you
know that, Curtis? Well done.
Bravo. Gilliam has never been here
- to the Engine. I’ve never been
to the Tail Section.

CURTIS
Why not? Too dirty for you? Don’t
want to rub against the vermin of
the Tail Section? What?

Wilford expertly flips a steak and potatoes and adds a
handful of mushrooms. He uses his spatula to point to his
“station” - his Engine.

WILFORD
Do you think my station is without
it’s own drawbacks?
(Curtis smirks)
It’s hot. It’s noisy.
(beat)
And it’s lonely.

Claude doesn’t like that statement.

CURTIS
Right. Poor fucking Wilford.
Steaks, plenty of room, this whore
to bring you whatever you want.

At this, Wilford raises an eyebrow.
WILFORD

Curtis, every one has their own pre-
ordained position...
54

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 94.

Wilford does that peculiar gesture Mason did previously with
his one hand, the other hand flipping the ingredients on the
skillet this way and that.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
.»+-and everyone is in it. Except
you.

CURTIS
That’s what people in the best
place say to the people in the
worst place. There’s not a soul on
this train who wouldn’t trade
places with you.

WILFORD

Would you trade places with me?
CURTIS

Fuck you, you son of a bitch.
WILFORD

I see you have fight left in you.

(beat)
Curtis, dear boy, the fact is we
are all stuck inside this blasted
train. We are all prisoners in
this hunk of metal.

(suddenly)
Medium rare? And this train is a
closed eco-system. We must always
strive for balance. The water, the
air, the food supply, the
population - all must be kept in
balance.

Curtis remembers Mason’s speech about fish population.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
For optimum balance, however, there
have been times when more radical
solutions were required. When the
population needed to be reduced
rather...drastically.

INT. TAIL SECTION - ENTRANCE

Tail Section Passengers run to the end of the section like a
herd of sheep being chased by a pack of wolves. They pile
everything they own to block the Gate. Chan throws a chair,
as big as himself, up onto the barricade. The sound of gun
fire comes from the other side.
55

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 95.

INT. MACHINERY SECTION

BLAM - The distant echo of gunfire wakes Yona. Namgoong,
crouching painfully on the stairs, makes a bandage from his
torn trousers for his wounded belly. He doesn’t look good.

YONA
Huh? What happened?

NAMGOONG
(mumbles )
Brainless girl, NOW she wakes up.

Yona, concerned, runs to Namgoong, trips and falls awkwardly.
Reaching out to balance herself, her hand lands squarely on
Namgoong’s belly.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
YEEEYAHHH!

Yona tilts her head - she hears something - she looks at the
back Gate as it begins to be battered from the other side.

Namgoong points to where the stair rails meet the corridor.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Yona, open that panel. Right below
your left foot.

Yona lifts a heavy iron lid with a grunt, exposing a
circuitry panel as the Gate hinges begin to creak and break.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Okay, pay attention. There’s one
each of red, yellow and blue wires.
(Yona nods)
On the other side should be sockets
numbered one to twelve. See them?

Namgoong dismantles the stair rail into two long metal pipes,
keeping one and rolling one to Yona. The gate is nearly
broken apart.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Three wires, twelve sockets. So
how many combinations can we make
out of them, Yona?

Perhaps still drunk, Yona looks totally confused.

The Gate breaks down with a BANG. Brain-addled “ZOMBIES” -
addicts out of their minds - rush in from the Brothel/Opium
Den. Seeing Namgoong and Yona who beat them and stole from
them - they scream for joy!

ZOMBIES
KILL! KILL!
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 96.

They blast the air with, of all things, vuvuzelas! Namgoong
moves into the narrow corridor, meeting the rush of Zombies
head on, swinging his pipe.

WILFORD (V.O.)

We don’t have time for true natural
selection - we would all starve
waiting for that. The next best
solution is to have individual
units kill off other individual
units. This is what I call man-
made natural selection.

56 INT. ENGINE SECTION - WILFORD’S ROOM

Wilford sits at the table, chewing his steak. Curtis has not
touched his food but it is so very, very tempting.

WILFORD

From time to time, we need to stir
the pot. Historically, my pot
stirrings have taken the form of
uprisings. The Revolt of the
Seven. The MacGregor Riots.

(points his bloody knife

at Curtis)
The Great Curtis Revolution!

CURTIS

WILFORD
A blockbuster production with a
devilishly unpredictable plot! The
shelf-life of this narrative should
surely be more than a decade.

Curtis’ face hardens.

WILFORD (CONT’D)

Who could have predicted your
counterattack with the torch in the
Yekaterina Tunnel! Pure genius!
That wasn’t what we had in our
plan.

CURTIS
We? Our plan?

Curtis’ face loses its color as Wilford observes coolly.
WILFORD
Don’t tell me you didn’t know. We,
Gilliam and I. Our plan.

Mentioning “Gilliam” pricks up the hair on Curtis’ neck.
57

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 97.

CURTIS
Gilliam?

WILFORD
Yes, my dear boy. Gilliam. The
Tail and the Front are supposed to
work together. We are all
connected. Gilliam was more than a
partner, really. A friend.

CURTIS
Bullshit. I don’t believe you.

WILFORD
Our original agreement was for this
insurgency to end at the Yekaterina
Tunnel and then the survivors would
go back to the Tail Section to
enjoy much more space...but...

CURTIS
You're a fucking liar. Gilliam
would never...

WILFORD

(cuts off)
Calm down. Calm down. It’s all
worked out fine. Your
counterattack actually made the
insurgency ten times more exciting.
Unfortunately, the front suffered
greater losses than anticipated,
for which Gilliam paid the price.

(slashes his throat with

one hand)
He let you go on and broke our
bargain. Isn’t it ironic? How
people dramatically cross the thin
barrier between life and death?
Now, there is just one last thing
left to do - tally up the numbers.

INT. TAIL SECTION

The section has been totally seized by the Soldiers. Tail
section Passengers, face down on the floor with their hands
bound behind their backs, sound off for Egg-Head and
Soldiers.

Egg-Head goes to a plate that reads “Wilford Enterprises”
(the one behind Gilliam’s shoulder in Scene # 5) and slides
open a panel to reveal an old-fashioned phone.

Close up of Egg-Head on the phone.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 98.

EGG-HEAD
Finished here. We await your
instructions.

INT. ENGINE SECTION

Wilford holds an identical phone, standing beside a “Wilford
Enterprises” plate that has been opened.

WILFORD
Stand by.
(looking at Claude)
Is it still the same number?

Claude, still aiming her gun at Curtis, counts the numbers
with the fingers of her other hand on her thigh.

CLAUDE
(nods )
Yes, it still stands at 74 percent.

WILFORD
(to Egg-Head)
OK. Carry on. Shhh. Wait.
Spare 18 to celebrate our 18th
year.

CLAUDE
(adoringly)
Wise decision.

Claude yells out in the direction of Wilford’s phone,
confident her message reaches Egg-head.

CLAUDE (CONT'D)
(back to business)
Spare 18 per Wilford the Merciful.
INT. TAIL SECTION

EGG-HEAD
Yes sir.

Egg-head, still holding the phone, nods to the Soldiers.
RA-TA-TAT-TAT - Soldiers open fire on the immobile prisoners.
Screams pierce the air.

INT. ENGINE SECTION

Curtis shrivels as he listens to the sound of gun blasts and
screams through the phone. Enraged, his face reddens as he

grabs the fork instinctively. Claude swiftly draws her
handgun directly at Curtis’ temple.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 99.

WILFORD
(holding the phone)
I'll miss Gilliam. I’11 miss our
late night chats. Oh he could go
on for hours, all with only one
arm! Quite remarkable, don’t you
think?

Overcome with shock and rage, Curtis rises to lunge at
Wilford with his fork.

CURTIS
Shut up!

BLAM - Claude shoots the fork right out of his hand. PING -
the bullet ricochets off the engine.

WILFORD
(continues his eating)
Mind the Engine - she’s getting
sensitive, you know.

CLAUDE
(smiles)
Sorry...
(stern)
Sit down and mind your table
manners.

WILFORD
Please, try to keep your sense of
humor.

Curtis reluctantly sits down, his eyes burning with hatred.

WILFORD (CONT’D)

Well, now I see what Gilliam meant.

He told me you’re smart and

brilliant, but always so tense. He

worried about you, you know.

And... what was her name... Alice?
(exaggerated voice)

Alice, where are you? Maybe you

should go meet her and loosen up a

little.

Curtis is ready to collapse, his world crumbling in the shock
and confusion.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
(looking at Curtis)

What’s with that face? What’s the

matter? You look like a crazy

person. As if we need more crazies

on this train!

INT. MACHINERY SECTION

Insane Zombies keep coming at Namgoong. He crushes one but
another takes its place. They blast vuvuzelas and do not
retreat. Franco appears at the gate but stops to watch the
battle, waiting for Namgoong to tire himself out.

NAMGOONG
(fighting)
Yona, don’t rush! Try one at a
time! One color first and the
next!

Yona plugs nodules to multi-colored wires creating sparks but
the gate does not move. Namgoong half-crouches due to the
pain in his abdomen.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Enough - you insane freaks - stop
coming out already!

The Zombies respond with slurred commotion and vuvuzelas.
Franco, flanked by the insanely joyful horde, is devoid of
expression, looking towards Yona.

WILFORD (V.O.)
You know, I believe it is easier
for someone to survive on this
train if they have some level of
insanity.

INT. ENGINE SECTION

WILFORD
As Gilliam well understood, we need
to maintain a proper balance of
anxiety and fear, chaos and horror
in order to keep life going. If we
don't have them, we need to invent
them. In that sense, the Great
Curtis Revolution you invented was
truly a masterpiece.

Dazed and confused, Curtis’ eyes are empty as if each of
Wilford’s words is sucking the life out of him.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
Come here, Curtis. I have
something to show you. You deserve
it.

Wilford directs Curtis to follow him into a circular gate
where stands the Engine Core. Claude nudges Curtis’ back
with her handgun, pushing him towards the Core. Curtis
follows Wilford and slowly walks into the Core.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 101.

It is perfectly quiet - no engine noise, rumble of the
wheels, nothing. It is sound proof. Curtis takes it in: he
is awed by the mysterious and seductive isolation.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
Cozy, yes? Peaceful.

CURTIS
(nods )

WILFORD
You are now in the heart of the
Engine. I’ve devoted my entire
life to this - the eternal engine.
It is eternity itself.

Curtis’ eyes can’t lie as he takes in the stillness, which he *
hadn't felt for a long time. *

WILFORD (CONT’D)
Have you ever been alone on this
train? When was the last time you
were alone? Can’t remember, can
you. So please do take your time.

Wilford offers a gentle, fatherly smile to Curtis and,
together with Claude, retreats out of Curtis’ vision. *

Curtis, finally, stands alone in the silent Core: for the
very first time in the entire film, we see Curtis all alone
by himself.

Quiet. Desolate but cozy as if time has stopped. Curtis *
breaks down. He drops to his knees, shoulders trembling,
warm tears pouring down endlessly.

Curtis’ POV: Tears drain on the floor as Wilford’s foot *
frames in.

Curtis raises his head to see Wilford holding up a metal
capsule.

WILFORD (CONT’D)
I just wrote it. For you. Here.
Take it.

Wilford holds out the capsule in his upturned palm. Curtis
takes it and, his hands shaking wildly, opens it to read the
Red Letter: “T-R-A-I-N.” Curtis lets it sink in. *

WILFORD (CONT’D)
I am old. I want you to take my
station. It’s what you wanted all
along.

CURTIS
No...1...
63

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 102.

WILFORD
You must tend the Engine, keep her
humming.

Wilford helps Curtis up. As Curtis stands to look towards
the back of the train for the very first time, Wilford stands
behind Curtis and whispers in his ear.

WILFORD (CONT’D)

Look, Curtis. Look back. Beyond
that gate - section after section
precisely where they’ve always been
and where they’1l always be all
adding up to what? The train. And
now, once again, the perfectly
correct number of human beings all
in their proper places all adding
up to what? Humanity. The train
is the world, we the humanity.

Curtis, just as Wilford has been doing all these years, looks
to the back of the train. Curtis isn’t sure anymore, Wilford
has gotten into his head.

WILFORD (CONT’D)

And now you have the sacred
responsibility to lead all of
humanity. Without you, Curtis,
humanity will cease to exist.
You've seen what human beings do
without leadership. They devour
one another. You, Curtis, you are
humanity. You, Curtis, you are
eternity. You, Curtis, you.

INT. MACHINERY SECTION/ENGINE SECTION

Yona takes a deep breath, trying to focus. Beyond, out of
focus, Namgoong fights Zombies. Yona connects Red into No.
5, yellow into No. 1, blue into No. 4. The sparks are huge
this time; the gate rumbles and opens.

YONA
Ahhh! !

NAMGOONG
Yona, Chronole!

Yona grabs her steel pipe and rushes up the steps. She spots
the Chronole Bomb peeking out of Claude’s pocket. Claude,
keeping her handgun aimed at Curtis, aims her rifle at Yona.
Yona, knowing the rifle is empty, heads straight for Claude.

Claude pulls the trigger. CLICK - the rifle is empty. CLUNK
- Yona strikes Claude in the back of the head with the steel
pipe. Claude arches back to fall flat on the floor.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 103.

Wilford and Curtis watch the spectacle from inside the Engine
Core, looking down on the people with condescending faces.

Yona grabs the Chronole Bomb and handgun from Claude. She
opens fire on the Zombies who fall right and left. The
Zombies, under fire, run away screaming wildly, their
vuvuzelas finally silenced.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
Yona! Give me the gun!

YONA
No!

Franco does not move. Yona coolly lifts the gun at Franco’s
face and REALLY aims carefully.

BLAM - Franco's left cheekbone is shattered but he hardly
even blinks.

FRANCO
Got more ammo?

YONA

Yona throws the pistol away. Namgoong groans at her action
as Franco now saunters forward raising his knife.

FRANCO
Let’s end this.

Namgoong and Franco engage in a mano-a-mano duel. Namgoong
screams at Yona while trying to evade Franco’s blade.

NAMGOONG
There! Above that handle!

Yona pastes the Chronole brick into the cracks near the exit
door handle. Namgoong, meanwhile, fights like a mad dog.

CURTIS’ AND WILFORD’S POV: within the Engine Core, the noise
from the outside is muted as we watch Namgoong, Franco and
Yona fight to the death.

Wilford is still right on Curtis’ ear:

WILFORD
Look at them. That’s how people
are. You know - you've seen this -
you've been this.

CURTIS

WILFORD
But no more. Look at them -
ridiculous, pathetic, aren’t they?
(MORE )
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 104.

WILFORD (CONT'D)
You can save them from themselves.
This is what Gilliam saved you for.
Curtis, this is your destiny.

Curtis stands in front of the circular Engine Core. His
eyes, as he looks down on the humans, have turned into exact
replicas of Wilford’s. Curtis’ bleak and cold eyes blink.

NAMGOONG
Yona! Curtis has the last match!

Yona finishes pasting the Chronole bomb to the door and runs
up the stairs to Curtis who returns a cold stare.

YONA
Curtis! The Match!

Curtis coldly extends his arm to Yona’s neck and shoves her
down to the Engine Core’s entrance. She is shocked to see
his transformed face. She is frozen. Curtis reaches out to
slap her face with the back of his hand.

YONA (CONT'D)

CURTIS
Get back! How dare you come here!

Yona can’t understand. She stops in her tracks. She looks
down to see what she is standing on.

YONA’'S POV: her feet stand on top of the “WILFORD
ENTERPRISES” iron plate.

YONA
KYAAAA!

Yona’s sudden shrill scream catches Wilford and Curtis’
attention though they look at her with indifference.
Namgoong and Franco stop fighting to look at Yona.

YONA (CONT'D)
(looking down)
Cough...coughing!

Coughing?! Suddenly, a thought flashes through Curtis’ mind;
something he has forgotten. He blinks as if to clear Wilford
out of his head.

Curtis runs to Yona and pushes her aside. He lifts the small
but thick iron hatch to unveil a horrible, inhuman sight:

Within the complex, intricate moving parts of the engine is
Tim - head shaved and ribs showing emaciation - coughing
gently. He has been completely inserted into the Engine,
repeating the same movement over and over - the exact gesture
that Mason and Wilford made before.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 105.

CURTIS
...TIMMY!

Curtis and Yona stand in shock without a word but Wilford
quietly mutters.

WILFORD
Ingenious, yes? That piece of
equipment went extinct five years
ago. We needed a - replacement.

Curtis has trouble breathing. He trembles. Yona hides her
eyes and weeps helplessly. Wilford, standing next to Curtis
and Yona, looks down the hole and continues casually.

WILFORD (CONT’D)

The space only allows for a very
small person. Young Children - six
and under - have difficulty
learning the concentration and
patience required for such an
important station but Claude spent
a long time training these parts.

CURTIS
You...

WILFORD
The engine lasts forever but not so
all of its parts. Thank goodness
the Tail Section has manufactured a
steady supply of kids.

CURTIS
You fucking bastard!

Curtis hits Wilford’s face hard. Wilford falls to the floor
but wipes the blood away with ease.

WILFORD
Curtis, don’t disappoint me - I've
come to have such faith in you. By
now, you must realize that everyone
has their own pre-ordained
position...

Wilford makes that gesture yet again - EXACTLY THE SAME as
Tim makes now. Curtis watches Wilford finish and then kicks
him. Wilford is knocked out. Curtis is back to his normal
self, his eyes focused with determination and rage.

Curtis bends down to reach out to Tim stuck inside the hole.
CLACK - Curtis’ arm gets jammed by the Engine parts. Curtis
bites back excruciating pain to stop the machine’s movement
for a brief second.

Yona, crying out of control, comes to help Curtis but he
holds out his other hand.

*
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 106.

Curtis grabs Yona’s hand, palm up, just like Gilliam. She
feels something and opens her hand: the matchbook.

YONA

CURTIS
Go!

Yona runs to the Chronole Bomb, tears still streaming down
her face.

Curtis reaches out with all his might to grab Tim’s weak
shoulder. Tim looks up at Curtis but doesn’t recognize him
and keeps up his movement.

On top of the Machinery Section’s viaduct, Namgoong and
Franco are intertwined in a mortal, wrestling rumble to gain
control of the knife that lies far from the two. Namgoong,
the weaker of the two, suddenly grabs Franco’s BALLS.

FRANCO
AWWW!

NAMGOONG
Yona! Fire!

Yona stands by the Chronole Bomb pasted on the Side Exit.
She opens the matchbook to reveal - one single match left
inside. She closes her eyes and breathes out in her unique
way.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
What the fuck are you doing?!
Fire! Now!

Yona strikes the match. Nothing happens. She tries again
but the match refuses to ignite.

NAMGOONG (CONT’D)
(shouting in desperation)
Hold it near the tip!

Yona closes her eyes and breathes rhythmically.

Curtis, suppressing excruciating pain, extends his left arm
under Tim’s armpit and pulls him out. Curtis’ face is
completely contorted in pain as he holds Tim tight with his
good, right arm.

WANK WANK - an alarm sounds and red lamps around the Engine
Core lights up.

A pale, ghostly presence drops to the Engine Section floor
from cracks in the machinery. Another small child, emaciated
to the bones: Andrew’s son, Andy.
SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 107.

CURTIS
Andy!

Andy immediately repeats the same hand gesture. He walks
eyes blank, and opens another lid on the floor.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
No! Don’t go in there!

Andy, eyes empty, crawls into the hole and finds his place,
where Tim was inside moments ago. Wilford slowly pulls
himself up.

WILFORD
Don’t be so melodramatic. It’s not
as if they work 24/7. See, we do
change shifts. Right on time.

Claude - still bleeding, showing no emotion - wakes up and
stands up like a machine and holds up a long stick. She
shoves the stick inside the horizontal crack where Andy
appeared to scoop out a CAUCASIAN GIRL (6).

The Girl is still asleep, rubbing her eyes, as she
automatically walks toward the Core.

Alarms blare louder as the Engine Core protrudes like a
piston to reveal a LATINO GIRL (6) inside who walks out. As
the Caucasian Girl takes LATINO GIRL’s position, the piston
slowly retracts to its original position.

CURTIS
No...no!

Yona, opens her eyes, stops her rhythmic breathing and WOOSH -
fires the match. Yona puts the burning match to the fuse.
The fire wildly chases towards the Chronole Bomb.

NAMGOONG
GO UP YONA!

YONA
What about you Dad?

NAMGOONG
I’ll go after you. You go up now!

Yona goes up the stairs to Curtis who passes Tim carefully
into her arms. Curtis, his arm nearly torn off and gushing
blood, looks at Yona as he holds off his pain.

CURTIS
Go!

Curtis makes up his mind to give up his arm. He bites his
tongue as he prepares for the moment.
64

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 108.

CURTIS (CONT'D)
AAAAAAHHHHHH!

Namgoong and Franco pant hard almost running out of steam.

NAMGOONG
(to Franco)
Not that you understand me...

FRANCO
(moans )

NAMGOONG
You smell like shit!

Namgoong, with his final reserves of strength, breaks
Franco’s neck with a CRACK.

Namgoong runs for the stairs as the wick burns down. He
pulls down the lever to close the Gate to the Engine. The
Gate moves five inches but gets stuck - sparks erupt - and
stops in its tracks.

Namgoong is aghast: “Shit, now the blast will blow off the
entire engine section.” But it is too late.

Namgoong, out of instinct, runs to Yona who holds Tim tight
in her arms. The big mass of Namgoong holds the two of them
from behind.

Curtis, from the opposite side, walks toward them bleeding
from many wounds. With one arm gone, he resembles Gilliam or
perhaps a saint.

Namgoong and Curtis face each other to embrace Yona who holds
Tim in her arms. Namgoong, Yona, Tim, and Curtis together
form a single lump of human-beings.

B-O-O-M! The Chronole bomb goes off.

The flame swallows them all in a microsecond: Wilford and
Claude sit at the table slicing the steak oblivious to the
disruption only to be engulfed in flame. Namgoong, Yona,
Tim, and Curtis fly out as one great ball of flame.

Curtis' back and head crash with force into the iron mass at
the front of the engine.

EXT. EARTH

BOOM! The train shakes insanely, belching out of fire.

The mountain range beside the railroad trembles and the snow

on the top of the mountain starts to flow down in a great
avalanche, waves of snow cascading.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 109.

The train, running the tracks below, seems like a helpless
earthworm before this giant advancing tsunami of snow
producing an earthshaking rumble.

INT. TAIL SECTION

Chan, spared, looks up at the sound. Surviving Passengers,
Egg-Head and the occupying Soldiers look around wondering
what is happening.

B-O-O-M! - everyone flies up into the air.

EXT. TUNNEL - ENTRANCE

Just as the tsunami of snow is about to swallow the train, it
enters a tunnel - three sections only - before the rest of
the train is swept away down a sharp mountain slope. The
third and the fourth sections separate in a shower of sparks.
EXT. BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN

The avalanche spreads out to cover the entire mountain slope;
train Sections roll down to the very bottom under gigantic
masses of snow.

EXT. TUNNEL - EXIT

The first three Sections pop out the other side of the tunnel
and hit the heavily fallen snow. The train rises up in the

air and slides down before finally stopping.

Silence. Desolation.

INT. ENGINE SECTION

The Engine Section lies on its side. The burnt bodies are
strewn everywhere. Namgoong Minsoo and Curtis Everett,
released from their final embrace, lie side by side, burnt,
bloody and riddled with glass fragments and metal shrapnel.
Tim’s eyes are seen. They blink.

Yona’s hand pokes out.

YONA
Dad! Dad!

Yona shakes Namgoong’s body hopelessly, weeping. Tim stares
at Curtis' body. Beat. He starts the hand gesture again.

Yona looks through the blasted Exit Door at the blue sky
above. Snowflakes flutter riding a beam of sunlight.

SNOWPIERCER (Nov 1, 2011) 110.

EXT. TRAIN

Yona’s head pokes through the Exit Door. She inhales the
bright, icy air. The snowflakes and cold wind tussle her
black hair. She pulls Tim, clad in an Inuit fur coat, out
behind her.

CUT TO:

EXT. SNOWFIELD

Yona’s feet softly crush the snow as she walks. She puts Tim
down. He continues his hand movement. Yona surveys the
vast, white landscape; tears running down her cheeks.

Yona tilts her head - listening. She looks up a snow covered
hill where a figure comes into view: a polar bear.

The bear stands majestic and proud, regarding the humans.
His grunting breath rhythmically pounds Yona’s psychic
eardrums.

Yona breathes in and out, riding the rhythm. As Tim’s
attention is drawn to the bear, he finally stops the hand
gesture. Superimposed over his young face is his future
adult voice:

TIM (V.O.)
I've been cold since the day I was
born.
Tim’s mouth breathes white vapor.

TIM
Because I was born on the snow.

The rhythmic breathing turns into musical notes resembling
heart beats. Young Tim’s black face and white eyes fill the
screen.

FADE TO WHITE:

THE END
