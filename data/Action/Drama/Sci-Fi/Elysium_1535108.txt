ty

A YOUNG BOY, maybe 8, helps a NUN wash clothes. She hangs
them on the lines, as the hot LOS ANGELES sun beats down.

The little boy leoks up at the sky where he sees a majestic
floating SPACE HABITAT. A torus. Bigger than the moon but the
same effect against the blue sky.

MAX
Sister?

NUN
Yes Max?

MAX

Are the people from there, are they
different to me?

She looks over at the little boy for a moment, then goes back
te hanging the laundry, as we CUT TO--

EXT. SPACE

We see the TORUS as it sparkles in all of its glory. We fly
ever millions of mansions covering the inner habitable side
of the torus as it spins slowly in the sunlight.

NUN (V.0.}
They are not so different to you
Max. They are just rich. That's the
only difference. They are rich.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - DUSK

Gleaming rockets take off, tearing through the atmosphere and
into space from a run down SLUM in LOS ANGELES.

A LITTLE GIRL watches as they glow up into the heavens. Her
shirt is dirty and riddled with holes.

NUN (V.0.)
You see one day the rich decided
that Earth was too dirty for them
and they wanted a new place to
live, so they built Blysium.

EXT. ORPHANAGE - CONTINUCUS
Max lLeoks over at the nun skeptically.

MAX
But they look different.
NUN
I don’t think so. You think so?

 

Max nods, and we CUT TO--
A COMMERCIAL FOR THE NEW FALL LINE BY GUCCI.

Various supermodel-like faces come up on the screen. “A”
through "F” lettered next to each head. A FINGER selects the
“Cc” model, we realize it’s a touch screen,

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN takes her finger off the screen and walks
into a MEDICAL BAY that sits in a high-end designer store.
She lies down on an MRI looking machine.

The machine closes around her. A flash of light and then
GUCCI reads acress the image of the dazzling woman, her face
leoks instantly younger.

NUN (V.0.)
They just don’t get old the same
way as us...
EXT, ORPHANAGE -— CONTINUOUS

Max goes back to serubbing-

 

MAX
Do they get sick?

INT. GUCCI MEDICAL BAY

The MRI machine runs a laser up and dewn the woman’s body. A
computer monitor reads the diagnosis:

Trace amounts of CANCER. Certain smaller ailments. The laser
changes color. RE-ATOMIZING comes up on the screen,

NON (¥.0.)
They have machines to fix that.
They live longer. They are very
lucky.
BEEEP. Health check COMPLETED. 100% CLEAR.
The woman’s name and details come up: AGE 37. She looks 40.
EXT. ELYSIUM - DAY
ELYSIAN MOTHERS push strollers past a perfect lawn. They chat

as the curvature on the inside of the habitat stretches out
behind them. They look healthy, happy, perfect. ;

 
 

 

 

MAX (V.0.)
I don't want to get sick. I want to
go there like them. Then I won't
get sick.
INT. SPIDER'S LAIR — NIGHT

Lines of humans wait to buy illegal tickets to Elysium from
gun-strapped SMUGGLERS. We see a MOTHER and DAUGHTER.

NUN (V.C.)
Well, some people do go there...

We see the little girl get a fake ELYSIAN ID NUMBER burnt
into her wrist. She winces. A FATHER and his YOUNG SON on
crutches step forward. The father places the dirty cash down.
EXT. SPACE ~ DAY

A filthy graffiti-covered rickety old space-ship shoots away
from earth, heading toward the magnificent ring in the sky.

NUN (¥.0.)
Actually many people go there.

INT. IMMIGRANT SHIP
Throngs of illegal immigrants. The MOTHER strokes her
DAUGHTER'S hair. Coke bottles and garbage float in zero G.
The FATHER and his YOUNG SON lie waiting to land.
NUN (V.0.)

But it’s illegal, they don’t Like

us there.
EXT. ELYSIUM — DAY
As the ship pulls wp to the surface...
IND. PROTOCCE, ROOM

A very high-tech cylindrical room on the inside of Elysium. A
tiny scroll of text blinks on a computer monitor:

ILLEGAL ENTRY. DISPATCHING HOMELAND DEFENSE.

EXT. ELYSTUM - DAY

The graffitied ship touches down. The back bay doors open and
the immigrants emerge. The MOTHER helps her sick DAUGHTER out
onte the lawn of this new utopia.

NON (V.0.3
So they send us home...
a

 

The immigrants see HELICOPTER-LIKE VEHICLES dotting the LA
skies, getting closer, filled with IMMIGRATION POLICE DROIDS.

The immigrants run for their lives. The father and son get
caught, as a droid fires a net over them, trapping them.

MAX (V.0.)
All of us?

NUN (¥.0.)
No, not all...

The mother and daughter escape through a hedge. The mother
throws a rock through the window of a big empty mansion. She
epens the door and carries her sick child inside.

INT. MANSION ELYSTUM ~ MED BAY

fhe mother finds an in-house medical bay. Like a large
hospital MRI inside each of the Elysian homes. She puts the
child down on the machine and presses the button. The machine
scans the barcode on her wrist. The MRI closes around her.

NUN (V.0.)
Some people stay...

 

The mother watches a screen. The graphic on screen shows the
RE-ATOMIZATION PROCESS. The machine opens, and...

The girl looks healthy. The screen reads: 100% CLEAR. The
mother cries with happiness as she hugs her healthy daughter.

NUN (V.0.)
They stay as long as they can....

EX?. ELYSIUM MANSION - LAWN - DAY

The young girl and mother sit at a picnic, enjoying every
second, watching artificial waterfalls in the distance, but-~

They see little black dots on the horizon. Those helicopter~
Like vehicles. The mother wraps up fast, racing inside. i

NUN (¥.0.)
But sooner or later, they are
found...

INT. ELYSIUM MANSION - DAY
The mother and daughter hide. The doors BLOW OPEN. HOMELAND

DEFENSE droids raid the house, The mother is violently
handcuffed, the girl trying te protect her is held down.

INT. DEPORTATION HANGAR —- NIGHT

A huge hangar. ILLEGALS are lined up like cattle, waiting to
be deported. The massive space shuttle waits as orange jwmnp-
suited humans climb on board. ILLEGAL ALIEN on their backs.

The mother and daughter are among them.

the immense shuttle lifts up and departs. Pan with it, Earth
comes into frame. Huge and bright, it feels not far away.

NUN (V.0.)
And they are sent back here.

EXT. EARTH SLUM

The ship pulls up to a no name slum. The HUMANS are
repatriated. Thrown out by ARMED DROIDS.

MAX (V.0.)
It’s not fair.

EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY

NON
I know, € know my little Max. It’s
not fair. But one day if you become
a rich man you can go there.

Max nods, determined.

MAX
I will be rich.

NUN
Oh really. That’s good. How are you
going to be rich?

MAX
I will be a dealer.

The nun whips her head over, looking at Max.
NUN
A dealer? Who have you been
speaking to?
Max looks down and goes back to scrubbing.
MAX

Pedro, He said you can be rich if
you be a dealer.
NUN
Well you just stop listening to
Pedro. I don’t want to hear such
nonsense ever. Do you understand?

 

The nun turns back to her washing.

MAX
Yes sister.

Close-up on YOUNG MAX’s face as he scrubs the clothing.
Thinking, dreaming of ELYSIUM. We slowly DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MAX’S SHACK - MORNING

Adult MAX leans forward in front of a small dirty mirror. de
splashes water on his face. He is 30s, good locking, clearly
from a troubled past. We see gang tatts run down his neck and
arms. A small gold locket dangles from his neck.

EXT. LOS ANGELES FAVELA - MORNING

Max walks past serious GANGSTERS hanging out in the favela. A
few GIRLS hang out with them.

GANGSTER
Off to work?

 

CARLO
Gotta be up early to work that
line, man.

The gangsters laugh.
MAX
Yeah, laugh it up, remember you owe
me bail money Carlo.

Carlo goes quiet. Max keeps moving.

Wide shot of the FAVELA: we see the thousands of rickety
little houses and cinder-~block shacks all interconnected.

TITLE: LOS ANGELES ~ FORMERLY UNITED STATES 2109.

What looks like the layout of the Hollywood Hills,

overlooking a vast polluted population, seems to resemble
Tijuana more than Los Angeles. Women hang laundry, police
choppers fly overhead. Chickens squawk. Another day in LA.

Little favela CHILDREN suddenly appear, surrounding Max. They
try and go through his pockets. He slaps their hands away.

 
 

 

 

CHILD 1
You got money?

CHILD 2
We want money!

MAX
You think I got money? I NEED
Money, that’s why I'm going to
work. Wait...do YOU have money?

The children look confused. Max catches one of them and turns
him upside down, shaking him by his feet. A few coins fall
out of his pockets. The other children laugh hysterically.
Max puts him down.and grabs a five dollar coin.

MAX (CONT'D)
Uh huht Rich!

The kid grabs for it, the other kids dying with Laughter.
MAX (CONT‘D)
Now I can finally buy my ticket to
Elysium!
The kids laugh even harder. Max hands it back.

MAX (CONT’D)
Now fuck off.

The children run off laughing. Max continues down the sloping
favela. Up ahead he sees:

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE gathering. Ragged clothing, filthy and
starving. A flying machine heads toward the mob.

It slows and hovers overhead. The aixborne vehicle is mostly
blue and has a UN peacekeeper vibe. ELYSIUM FOOD PROGRAM
written on the side. Max keeps walking alongside the mob.

The rear bay doors open on the flying vessel and a robotic
DROID presses a release button on the cargo controls.

Food aid bags begin ejecting out of the jet. The huge grain
bags fall to the dusty ground. People fight over the food.

Max leoks up at the droid. its cold mechanical eyes looking
down con the humans. Max watches as the jet seals up and flies
away while the starving people fight fiercely over scraps.
INT. TRAIN — MORNING

Max stands in a crowded, filthy train. He watches LA skim by
out of the graffiti-laden windows.
He turns to see two ROBOTIC POLICE OFFICERS move through the
train. They check passengers, one of them carries a portable
scanner. They shine it at the HUMANS and their data comes up.

The Officers walk up to a bunch of decidedly dangerous
looking GANGSTERS. Each of them is scanned. The robots pat
the suspects down fairly violently.

GANGSTER
Itm clean, don’t fucking touch me!

POLICE DROID
(rebotic voice} Checked, move on.

The droids stalk through the train. They walk up to Max. He
watches them coming. They scan him. He smiles, cheery.

MAX
Good morning officers.

POLICE DROID
Multiple felonies. Extended history
of dealing. What’s in the backpack?

MAX
Ah, you know, a little of this,
littie of that--

One of the Officers tries to grab Max’s bag. Max resists.

MAX (CONT'D)
Guys seriously, I’m just on my way
to work, this is my stop here.

The Officer is not happy with Max hanging onto the bag. Very
quickly it whips out a telescopic BATON, as the train
suddenly comes to a stop. People start getting off.

MAX (CONT’D)
Look, your stick’s very scary, but
this is my stop, okay? ft don’t want
any trouble.

Max tries to walk. WHACK! The Officer lashes him across the
knees, he falls. The second Officer grabs his neck and holds
him down. The first one rummages through his backpack.

The train starts moving again. Max struggles to look up at
the Officers since his head is down.

MAX (CONT'D)
That was my stop!

They subdue him violently, giving him a crack to the ribs.

The DROID is satisfied there are no drugs in the bag. He
throws it next to Max on the ground.

POLICE DROID
You are scheduled for parole hearing
68 today. Thank you citizen.

They move on. Max lies on the floor, his lip bleeding now. He
watches his stop disappear behind him. Then he slowly looks
up, chin bloody, eyes staring at ELYSIUM, so far away...

EXT. BLYSIUM

the huge 100 km diameter ring spins ever so slowly. Birds of
paradise wave gently in the clean air. We pan over to--

A large government complex. THE CcB. Its metal exterior looks
like a shiny version of the Pentagon.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM

The control room is a large NASA mission control style room.
Many workers sit at computer terminals. All of them are aimed
at a huge wall-sereen of data which projects a map of Flysium
with incoming and outgoing shuttle flight paths, real time
police data etc. At the highest seat of authority sits:

SECRETARY RHODES. Powerful, beautiful. Her eyes are cold,
sharp, missing nothing. She is the head of the ccB.

CCB AGENT
Sixteen incoming ships, ma’am. We
have permits for nine of them,
Usual raw materials, cargo. Seven
unaccounted for.

Rhodes watches the screen. Small ships incoming.

RHODES
Normal Monday morning. Scramble
units for each of the landing
sites.

CCB AGENT 2
Ja, actually ma‘am, it looks like
fifteen of our operational units
were pulled offline last night.
Rhodes snaps her focus over to the agent.

RHODES
What?!

the agent is reading her terminal in real time.
10.

CCB AGENT 3
Looks like they were decommissioned
by Minister Patel. We have six
active units, Ma‘am.

RHODES
Five of which are dealing with
yesterday's squatters?

CCB AGENT 2
And the immigrants in delta
quadrant. Would you like us to send
the standard warning to the
incoming ships?

Rhodes just shakes her head, disgusted.

RHODES
Yeah, that always works.

CCB AGENT 3
(checking comm) First undocumented
ship just touched down.

A massive satellite-image comes up, looking down on the
gqraffiti-riddled ship as it lands and ILLEGALS stream out.

OVERHEAD VOICE
We are tracking...24 illegals.

CCB AGENT
Ma‘am, we need to dispatch our
available team to one of the
landing sites. Should we send them?

Rhedes looks at the little red dots on screen.

RHODES
Axe there any active weapons
satellites?

CCB AGENT 4
Negative ma'am. Also decommissioned
two days ago. Along with all
terrestrial batteries.

Rhodes slides back in her chair watching the satellite feed.

She considers, the red dots spreading. Finally...
RHODES:
How many of these incoming ships
are a debris danger?

Silence. A xoom of blank faces.

il.

RHODES (CONT’D)
Simple question. If we shoot them
down...how many...are...a....
debris...danger?

A flurry of typing. Rhodes keeps her eyes on the ships.

CCB AGENT 3
Uh....Based on current flight
paths, two of them. But again, all
systems are offline.

The wall graphic changes, two of the ships go red. With a
warning and a graphic showing potential debris spill.

RHODES
Not completely offline... What
agents are currently active that
have access te class $S weaponry?

CCB AGENT 4
We have two agents active that are
capable. R SMITH and M KRUGER.

REODES
Activate Kruger, He’s always
reliable.

CCB AGENT

Uh ma’am, that is a direct~-

REODES
I gave you an order.

CCB AGENT
Yes ma‘ am.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE LOS ANGELES — DAY

We see a man outside a dilapidated liquor store, his ragged
clothing covering his head like a Jedi. He picks at his
fingernails with a lethal looking knife. This is M KRUGER.

His wrist vibrates. He moves the burlap material to reveal a
shockingly high-tech device on his wrist built by RAYTHEON.

Ee clicks the ANSWER button, we see a wire running back up to
his ear. We cannot see his face. Not yet.

CCB AGENT 3 (ON COMM)
Agent 32 Alpha 21b. We are sending
a packet over.
 

12.

Kruger pulls the ear~piece out of his ear. He clicks the
wrist device, a large ipod style screen. INCOMING DATA.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM

The huge wall-screen is a satellite image following Kruger
into a deserted field. We see him overhead as he pulls a rope
that removes a cover from a hole in the ground.

EXT. DESERTED FIELD LOS ANGELES - DAY

Kruger pulls out a stinger MISSILE looking device. He gets
into firing position, the ugly snout of the giant bazooka
housing multiple rockets.

He presses a button on his wrist device which syncs with the
missile launcher. He aims at the sky.

KRUGER
System in place.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM
Rhodes leans forward, inhales.

RHODES
Shoot them down.

CCB AGENT 3
Greenlight, 2ib greenlight.

EXT. DESERTED FIELD LOS ANGELES

CLICK. He fires. Four small missiles snake up into the
stratosphere many times faster than the speed of sound.
Kruger is coughing on the rocket smoke. And laughing.
INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM

CCB AGENT 4
Missiles away.

EXT. SPACE

Four MISSILES speed into space. Like tiny pixels against
black, we see the ships hundreds of kilometers away.

We travel with one of the immigrant ships. We see Elysium up
ahead, a small snaking missile screaming toward us.

BOCOOOM!

The missile strikes, the ship implodes and jettisons
thousands of kilograms of shrapnel into space.

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

BET. SHUTTLE
We see another shuttle filled with immigrants.
INT. SHUTTLE

A FATHER looks out of the dirty porthole. Bis face goes white
as the missile snakes toward them. He holds his DAUGHTER.

EXT. SPACE

BOCOOM! The second ship is blown into oblivion. Sparkling
glinting shards of metal sprinkle into the universe.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM
The explosions fill the big wall-screen. One ship disappears.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Target neutralized.

The other one is gone.

OVERHEAD VOICE (CONT’D)
Target neutralized.

The screen is clear. the skies are empty again. Rhodes leans
back, exhales. The room sits in total silence. Then...

OVERHEAD VOICE (CONT‘D)
Secretary Rhodes please report to
the briefing center immediately.
Secretary Rhodes. To the briefing
center.

Rhodes stands up, straightens her jacket and confidently
walks out of the control room. The agents watch her go.

EXT. DESERTED PIELD LOS ANGELES

KRUGER looks over to see two YOUNG BOYS who witnessed him
firing the rockets. He tosses the weapon onto the ground.

KRUGER
Hey kids.

KID
Axe you like...the police?

He pulis a lethal knife from his coat.

KRUGER
Not really.
 

14.

 

As he approaches them with the knife, we CUP TO--

EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY

The hospital is old, dirty, run down. And very overcrowded.
INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL -— DAY

We move through the masses to find: MAX sitting, holding a
tissue to his lip, still bleeding.

A NURSE emerges. She is beautiful, but has the look of not
enough sleep and toc much stress. This is FREY, late
twenties. She slows when she sees him.

FREY
Max...? Max DaCosta...?

He smiles, but it pains him to smile.

MAX
Frey?! Long time.

FREY
Yeah.

 

She looks at his bloody lip, with a hint of disapproval.

FREY (CONT’D)
I see things haven’t changed.

MAX
This, this isn’t my fault.

FREY
Okay.

She takes out gauze, stitches, starts working.

FREY (CONT'D)
This might sting a little.

MAX
How long have you--

FREY
Don’t talk.

He keeps his mouth shut, as she stitches him up. He looks at
her, their faces close. She finishes. Max starts to talk but--

NURSE
Frey. They need you up on the third
flocr.

 
 

 

 

15.

FREY
Be right there.

She packs up her stuff to go.

MAX
Hey, you think maybe we could...

FREY
Bye Max, you stay out of trouble.

Max just smiles. It still stings a little.

MAX
You know mé...(she’s gone) I’m
clean.

He sits there a moment. Alone. Then he grabs his bag.
EXT. BIOSPHERE PACTORY - DAY

MAX walks towards the entrance of the immense plant. Its
smoke stacks pour pollution into the atmosphere.

The giant facility is ringed by a tatty chain~link fence with
barbed wire. Guards at the front wave him through.

INT. BIOSPEERE FACTORY

Max walks into a busy safety prep area. He grabs a respirator
MASK off a hook and is about to put it on when the FOREMAN
stops him.

FOREMAN
Third time this month.

MAX
Yeah I know, sorry sir, won’t
happen again.

FOREMAN
That‘s what you said last time. I’m
docking thirty minutes. Get your
act together, Da Costa.

MAX
Yes sir.

Max salutes, walks to the airlock separating the entry from
the factory. As he enters the airlock, the Foreman yells:

FOREMAN
You're lucky to have this job.
MAX
Very lucky sir. I always dreamed of
at.

fhe airlock hisses open, revealing:

16.

The interior of the factory is MASSIVE. Thousands of workers
slave over machinery. On the assembly lines, we see--

The familiar POLICE and MILITARY DROIDS of ELYSIUM. This is
where their army is built.

Max walks through the huge space. He looks up to the second
level office, where the CEO presides, standing at the glass:

INT. CARLYLE'S OFFICE ~ DAY

CEO JOHN CARLYLE is Elysian, rich. He watches over the
factory through thick bulletproof glass. He sees all his

little minions.

INT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY

Max grabs his dolly off the rack and walks to
end of an assembly line. He keeps his eyes on

WORKER
Dude, you crazy? Don't look at him.

MAX
Whatever. You think he had his face
peel this morning?

The worker laughs.

He watches Max with cold attention.

his spot at the
Carlyle.

Max uses a foot pedal to load the new ROBOTIC head. He pulls
the silicone cover down and stretches it over the steel skull
of the police droid. He puts the head into the pallet.

Jump cuts: more heads, more silicone, more pallets.

Max walks them over to the kiln. Unloads them. Goes back,

gets more.

Unloads them. Gets more.

He gets a fresh batch of robotic SKULLS, he starts pulling
the silicone over one, he completes it.

Max locks around the factory. He looks up at the CEO, to make
sure he isn’t watching. He’s not there.

Max grabs a permanent marker and writes “FUCK THE POLICE”
ever the droid’s face. He then covers it with

the silicone.

 

 

 
 

 

 

it.

The kiln is full. He shuts the door. He looks at the large
buttons on the wall. CLICK he pushes THERMOPLAST. A large red
light shines. Through the three-inch thick glass porthole, we
see the massive microwave fire radiation at the DROID heads.

Once baked, the HEADS slide out of the back of the kiln. The
light goes off. A warning comes up. COOLING.

And then SAFE TO ENTER.

Max disengages the door and opens it. The kiln is EMPTY,
ready for more...

EXT. CCB HQ - DAY
The government building gleams. Outer space seen beyond it.
INt’. CCB HQ BRIEFING ROCGM - CONTINUOUS

The room leoks like a military tribunal, all aimed at
Secretary RHODES who sits alone with a single microphone,
facing a panel of high-level POLITICIANS.

REP PATEL
Do you understand that this
administration was elected on the
basis we would be more
compassionate to Earth? Do you get
that? We promised a kinder, gentler
rule. Instead, now we have a PR
nightmare on our hands.

RHODES
Forgive me sir. I don’t speak that
language. I don’t know what a PR
nightmare is. I do however know
that if this administration keeps
dedging the real issue, then we
will actually have a real nightmare
on our hands.

REP BURRARD
The real issue?

RHODES
Jesus Christ. Yes the REAL issue.
The ungodly influx of illegal
immigrants into this orbital
habitat. That issue. Go get your
milk and cookies and go to bed,
junior.

REP PENNY
How old are you, Secretary?
18.

RHODES
I’m one hundred and eight, ma’am.

 

REP PENNY
Well perhaps that explains your
penchant for resorting to twentieth
century tactics.

Representative Patel lifte a file sitting in front of him.

REP PATEL
Then there’s the use of this agent.
A Mr M KRUGER. Fifteen human rights
violations, spanning four
territories, rapes, weapons charges,
misappropriation of military
resources, false flag operations,
human rights atrocities-~

REP PENNY
The guy’s been diagnosed with
serious psychological issues.

REP PATEL
We made it explicitly clear to you
that we were no longer using
sleeper agents. And this is the
kind of person you hire? Some crazy
sleeper agent hiding out on earth?
You are a reckless fanatic, Rhodes.

 

RHODES
A fanatic? Sir, I am a patriot. I’m
the one protecting our children
fxom the great unwashed.

REP PATEL
I vote for a complete dismissal.

Not enough hands are raised. it’s split.

REP PATEL (CON?’D)
Alright. Fine, let’s reduce her
classification to level two, make
sure she never fires another
missile. And let’s discharge this
{locking at paper) Agent Kruger
permanently. All in favour?

The majority hold up their hands. Rhodes clenches her jaw so
tightly we can see the muscles flexing under her skin. i

 
 

 

 

19.

REP PATEL (CONT’D)}
Good. Effective immediately. Let's
update the protocol.

Patel puts his hand onte a biometric screen in front of him
The screen reads his hand, BREEP. The other politicians do
the same on their screens. Beeeeep.

REP PATSL (CONT‘D)
Secretary R Rhodes. Demoted to
level two clearance only.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Accepted. Secretary Rhodes demoted.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM

The familiar high tech room. Two heavily-armed DROIDS stand
outside. Inside, we see a server array of computers, with
AIDEM written across them. A screen flashes:

SECRETARY RHODES DEMOTED - LEVEL TWO CLEARANCE ONLY.
Int. CCB HQ BRIEFING ROOM

REP PATEL
AGENT M KRUGER discharged from CCB.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Agent Kruger discharged
immediately.

The politicians take their hands cff the screens.

REP PATEL
Thank you everyone, dismissed.

The politicians get up and leave. Rhodes accosts Patel,
getting in his way. She speaks low, deadly.

REODES
Don’t come crying to me when there
are so many of them here that this
place looks like Farth, and you
need a nuclear weapon to restore
order.

REP PATEL
Den't worry, I will have moved.

The politician turns, leaves. Rhodes watches him walk away.
20.

BXT. KRUGER‘’S SHACK - DAY

A tin shack sits in the baking sun. Various feral dogs roam
around, barking. Poverty stricken children play.

INT. KRUGER’S SHACK - DAY

We see Kruger’s hands using a CRKT tactical knife to RIP the
boy’s red sweater apart, he pulls change out of its pockets.

His shack is stuffed to the brim with a mixture of absurd
Elysian weaponry, along with blades and swords and computer
tech. Various women’s high heels and clothing lie around.

Kruger’s wrist vibrates. He pulls his sleeve back, “incoming
encrypted NOTIFICATION.”

“BGEN? C M KRUGER immediate DISCHARGE from CCB. Please report
to HQ for debrief - repeat IMMEDIATE DISCHARGE.”

Kruger stands motionless.
A new text flashes: RETURN all weaponry to local EMBASSY.

Kruger punches the wall with immense power. Suddenly he grabs
a throwing knife and hucks it out of the open door. We hear a
dog yelp in dying pain. And then silence.

INT. PAROLE HEARING OFFICE - DAY

The office looks like the DMV. Throngs of plastic chairs line
the large room. Up in front of the reformed criminals are:

Booths where PAROLE OFFICER ROBOTS sit. Like a cheaply built
plastic robot version of a $1 kids ride outside a grocery
store, its mouth a simple speaker.

Tatoo-covered reformees sit and explain themselves to the
plastic bureaucrats.

MAX sits holding his paper number. BEEEP.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Four hundred and thirty five.

Max walks to the cubicle booth. As he adjusts the chair and
sits down, speakers in the booth begin playing.

CUBICLE SPEAKERS

MAX
WHAT?! No no wait, this is a--

ROBOT PARCLE OFFICER
Police officers noted violent anti
social behavior. We regretfully
must extend parole.

Max clenches his jaw. We see his hands under the table

adjusts its head to face Max for the first time.

ROBOT PAROLE OFFICBR (CONT’ D)

EXT. FAVELA OUTDOORS ~ DUSK

Max arrives home at the favela. RAP blares, GANGSTERS mill
about. YOUNG KIDS and single MOTHERS all over.

Max finally gets to his shack. JULIO, Max’s lifelong friend,
drinks beers outside his place with some other sketchy
looking GUYS. Julio follows Max in and grabs a beer for him.

INT. MAX’S SHACK ~ NIGHT

Max opens his closet and starts putting his stuff down. Julio
hands him a beer and slumps onto the bed.

JULIO
What up man? How was the line?

Max takes a swig on the beer. Julio sees Max's lip.

JULIO (CONT‘D)}
Dude! What happened?

Max feels his lip. He shrugs. i

MAX

Jelio leans forward and gets serious.

JULIO
Listen man...

Max anticipates what‘’s coming and stops him.

MAX
Can we just skip to the part where
i say no?

JULIO

Hear me out first, okay? Please.
Julio takes a zip lock bag of weed out of his cargo pants.

JULIO (CONT'D)
Tt got a new connection, giving me
this shit for nothing, for dirt.
I'm selling it like crazy, man.
We're making good cash right now.

A beat. Max waits for the rest of the pitch.

MAX
T’m sorry, was that it? Was that
the whole pitch?

JULIO
Shut up-~

MAX
No, I mean, did you rehearse that?

JULIO
Look homey, I don’t want to be
selling this shit, I don’t want
this life, just like you, but we
both want Elysium, right?

MAX

JULIO
So dude. Hello. You’re like the
best hustler on the block, let me
hook you up, we go back doing it
old scheol, the two of us. I swear
to you, within a year we'll have
enough cash for IDs and a flight up
there.

Max lifts his pants leg to show Julio a parole anklet.
 

 

MAX
i think you might have forgotten
this little guy. This fella means
ten-to-twenty next time. Got it?
Yeah I want to get wp there, live
in a big house, eat all I want. But
I gotta save up, man.

JULIO
And how you gonna do that? Your big
hip hop careex?

Julio laughs. Max laughs with him.
MAX

Shut up. I would have been awesome,
I had some sick rhymes.

 

JULIO
Ah, so it’s not the rap career.
MAX
No bitch, I got a job. Unlike some
people.
Julio shakes his head.
JULLO al
Pussy.
MAX
idiot.
JULIO
Puta.
MAX

Shut the fuck up, get out.

Max stands up to force Julio out.

JULIO
You wanna step out for some fun? We
met some nice ladies on the beach.

MAX
Oh yeah, I’m sure, like the last
ones you got, what was it again?
Herpes.

JULIO (CONT’D)
Seriously, these girls are reaily
fine, they said they want to meet
you, we all going to Raza‘s.

Julio takes the small zip iocked bag of weed and dangles it
in front of Max's face.

JULIO (CONT'D)
Sell me, sell me. Buy a ticket,
leave this shit hole.
Max laughs.

MAX
Get out.

JULIO
I will wear you down, you used to
be a LEGEND.
He pushes Julio out and shuts the door.
EXT. MAX'S SHACK - CONTINUOUS

JULIO
Now you make the po po!

Julio turns and leaves, meets up with the other guys.

SULIO (CONT'D)
No dice.

INT. HOSPITAL ~ LOCKER ROOM — DAY

Frey slides her RFID chip across a digital punch-card
machine. It beeps. Work is over. Frey stands there for a
moment. Another NURSE approaches her.

NURSE (0.S.)
Hey, you okay?

Frey turns, nods politely.

NURSE (CONT'D)
Well look, if you need anything
sweetheart, just lemme know. We all
wanna do what we can.

FREY
Thank you.
26.

INT. HOSPITAL WARD ~ DAY

Frey arrives at a ward that reads CANCER. She walks through
rows and rows of sickly children in creaking, rusted beds.

Frey goes into a private area with a curtain drawn. She finds
a YOUNG GIRL laying in bed. 6 years old.

Frey checks the girl's vitals, charts. And then Frey just
looks at her. And runs a hand through the girl’s hair.

This sick kid is her daughter MATILDA. A beat. And...

A DOCTOR arrives.

DOCTOR
Hey. I was wondering if we could
have a quick word.

INT. X-RAY LAB - DAY
The Doctor finds an empty room, and they go inside.

DOCTOR
Look, Frey, you know we've done
everything we could for your
daughter, right?

FREY
What do you mean COULD?

DOCTOR
I'm on your side, okay? But I had a
meeting today with the board and
they're recommending we send her
home with you.

Frey’s eyes well up. But she remains calm.

FREY
But...how can I work here and leave
her at home? You know that she
could...it could happen any minute.

DOCTOR
I know, I know. If she has a
seizure, you can bring her back to
the ward. But until then, she’s
discharged. We‘re not a rich
facility, we need that room back.

Frey slowly shakes her head as though this isn't happening.

 

 

 
 

 

 

27.

FREY
Can I just have till the end of the
week? There are more supplies I
have to get, please. Please.

bocrTor
Alright.

PREY
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Faizel.

The doctor turns and leaves. Frey leans back against the
wall. She puts her hands to her face.

EXT. LOS ANGELES FAVELA ~ MORNING
Morning light. The sound of dogs and chickens once more.
INT. MAX'S SHACK ~ MORNING

Max sits up as his alarm goes off. He splashes his face with
water, looks into the mirror.

INT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY - MORNING

Max walks along with many other slum doq FACTORY WORKERS.
They put on their MASKS and pass into the airlock.

INT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY ~ DAY

Max lifts yet another batch of HEADS onto the dolly. He
wheels them into the kiln, unloads them. He goes out, gets
one more, puts it in. He hits the button. The door shuts and
then JAMS. He looks inside: one of the pallets is skew.

He hits the CANCEL button, but it doesn’t open the door.

He looks around for help. He walks to the guy next to him.

MAX
Hey man, can I bug you for a second?

WORKER
What? They gonna dock our pay.

MAX
Yeah, it’s just, the door is
jammed. Have you seen that before?

He follows Max to his kiln, looks through the half open door.
WORKER

Huh, shit that’s weird. I think
it’s that skew one there, see that?
28,

MAX
Yeah, but I can’t reset it to open.
WORKER
Well just squeeze through.
MAX
What? Fuck that.
WORKER
Yeah, it’s fine, fuck it, 7 have to

get. back.
The worker goes back over to his assembly line.

Max looks around nervously. The Foreman at the far end of the
factory motions for Max to get back to work.

Max points at the broken door, but the Foreman doesn’t care.
Max looks back at the door, sees the skew palette.

MAX
Why the hell didn’t I take the
Burger King job?

Max takes a breath, and tries to squeeze through the gap. He
pops his body through and is inside the k He goes over to
the heavy palette and starts to straighte

 

BEEEEEEP. The door suddenly snags free and....SHUTS.

 

Max rushes to the door. He bangs hysterically on the glass.

The KILN fires up, we see WAVES OF HEAT DISTORTION as the
RADIATION engulfs us. Max screams and collapses to the floor.

An emergency alarm sounds. Computer monitors read “ORGANIC
TISSUE DETECTED K 34.” The factory shuts down.

UP ABOVE: CEQ Carlyle walks back to his window, he sees
workers run to Max's kiln. A large overhead siren wails. On
the window, we see holographic projections of BIOSPHERE stock
prices falling with each second of non-production.

Max struggles to stay conscious. We see the Foreman rush to
the door, other workers using CROWBARS to wrench it open.

they force it open and allow a smalij. BOMB DISPOSAL-STYLE
ROBOT to enter. It wheels itself up to Max and scans him. It
grabs Max with its robotic pincer and starts to drag him out.

Max lies on the floor unconscious as he is dragged.
CLOSE UP: Max’s face.

FLASHBACK:
EXT. CRPHANAGE - DAY

YOUNG MAX sits outside on a dilapidated merry go round in the
dirty, sunny orphanage playground. He has his head in his
lap. His eight year old knuckles are bloody.

The NUN we saw earlier walks out into the empty playground.
She calmly sits down next to him. He lifts his head and looks
over at her, he has a bloody nose.

MAX
It wasn’t my fault, sister.

NUN
Yes I know. I know, Max.

Max slumps his chin onto his knee, squinting in the sunlight.
We see BLYSIUM through his Pov.

MAX
I just want to go there.

The nun looks at the broken boy for a beat. She delicately
reaches around her neck and unclips a gold chain. At the end
of it is a smali spherical pendant. She points up at Elysium.

NUN
You see how beautiful it looks to
us from here?

The torus looks stunning, glinting in sunlight.

MAX
Yeah.

NUN
Well, look how beautiful we look
from there.

She opens the locket and it reveals a photo of BARTH from
space. The blue marble. Equally stunning.

NUN (CONT'D)
You keep this. This is yours now.
To never forget about where you
come from, Little Max.

She puts it into his hand. He closes his fingers.
30.

INT. PACTORY MED BAY — DAY

MAX POV: a blurred figure overhead. The image comes into
focus. It is the small optical array “head” of the HAZMAT
ROBOT. It runs a scan of him. A laser skims over Max.

MAX
What..... what....happened?

He locks over to see he’s in a gross little med bay, He sees
a porthole embedded in a thick blast-proof door. The Foreman
looks through it at Max.

EXT, FACTORY MED BAY - CONTINUOUS

Carlyle walks with purpose. Two heavily armed 24/7 security
droids walk with him. As Carlyle approaches the Foreman, he
takes out a Prada handkerchief, so repulsed by the setting-

CARLYLE
What the hell is going on? Why has
production stopped?

FOREMAN
Sir, an accident in one of the
thermoplast kilns, he’s been
exposed. (nodding at med bay)

CARLYLE
Don't breathe on me, cover your
mouth.

FOREMAN
Sorry sir.

CARLYLE
Are you telling me that our
assembly lines are down because
some worker got irradiated? Is that
what you're telling me?

The Foreman averts his gaze, turns to some SUPERVISORS. He
gives them a sign to start up. We hear machines rev to life.

FOREMAN
Sorry, sir.

Carlyle moves to the glass porthole and looks in at Max. Max
looks back. Their eyes lock.

CARLYLE
Zo assume he signed the usual
waivers. Does his skin fall off or
something?

(MORB)

CARLYLE (CONT'D)
I don’t want to replace that
bedding in there, just get him out,
get him out of there.

Carlyle turns and leaves.
INT. FACTORY MED BAY - CONTINUOUS

HAZMAT ROBOT
You have endured a level four
radioactive exposure.

Max is frozen as he hears the news.

HAZMAT ROBOT (CONT'D)
Your white blood cell count will
diminish rapidly, followed by
multiple organ failure. Finally
cardiac arrest, resulting
approximately twenty days from
exposure.

Max’s hand grips the bed linen and crushes it.

HAZMAT ROBOT (CONT'D)
For legal reasons we ask you use
the secondary exit from the factory
to avoid contamination of staff.

The robot drops a bottle of pills on Max.

HAZMAT ROBOT (CONT'D)
MIPOROL will abate symptoms.
Thank you.

the robot wheels itself out of the room. Max lies alone in
the tin bed. He looks over at the porthole. The Foreman
leaves the window. Max watches as he disappears.

Max lies back and slowly looks up at the roof. He tries to
control his breathing. He grits his teeth. Bites down hard.

EXT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY - DAY

Max hobbles out of a steel door into the LOS ANGELES
sunlight. His face is white and sick. His eyes black.

A wall of bulletproof plexiglass runs the length of the exit.
A thick yellow line shows the side WORKERS must stay on. Max
slowly puts one foot in front of the next, struggling.

Carlyle comes out of the factory on the other side of the
giass escorted by his security droids. A magnificent ELYSZAN
shuttle, like a Rolls Royce, sits waiting for him.
ue
S

Max sways with nausea, he loses his footing, steps over the
line, supports himself on the glass, INSTANTLY, sentry GUNS
aim at him, getting too close to Carlyle.

 

SECURITY SPEAKERS
You have stepped into a restricted
area. Please step back into the
approved area.

Saliva drips from Max's mouth as he looks up at the guns and
over at Carlyle, staring through the glass.

Carlyle is about to climb into his shuttle. He looks over at
Max. Then he covers his face with his handkerchief, and
climbs into the SHUTTLE. Max steps away from the plexiglass,
as the turbines spool up. The guns return to neutral,

INT. TRAIN ~ DAY

Max sits in one of the chairs. He is awkwardly slumped. His
face a sallow pale white. A thick glaze of sweat coats his
features. His black bagged eyes look out over the city.

EXT. FAVELA - DUSK

Max hobbles very slowly up the stairs into the favela. The
Little CHILDREN circle him, curious about what his ailment
is. Max is too weak to disperse them.

EXT. MAX'S SHACK - CONTINUOUS

Max is able to see his shack. Julio and the others are
crowded around the area. Julio looks over at Max.

Max hangs onte the wall to stay upright. Julio runs to his
friend. Max collapses and falls to the dirty favela floor.

JULIO
My god man, what happened? MAX!

INT. MAX'S SHACK ~ NIGHT

Julio has Max draped over his shoulder, other gangsters push
the door open as Julio brings him inside and slumps him down
on his bed. The others follow. Lots of noise and commotion.
Max looks over at the gangsters, weakly.

MAX
Get out, get the fuck out.

The gangsters all leave. Except Julio who sits on his bed.

 

 

 
 

 

 

33.
MAX (CONT'D)
Go.

JULIO
No. No man.

Max looks over at his backpack, tries to reach it, his hands
tremble. Julio leans and grabs it for him.

MAX
Water.

Julio runs out. Max slowly pulls the MIPOROL out of the bag,
Julio comes back with a coke bottle filled with water,

JULIO
What‘s going on, Max?

Max ignores him and swallows the pills, sipping the water.

MAX
Can they really cure anything up
there?

JULIO

Yeah, man...they fix it all.

MAX
I need to get up there. Now.

JULIO
Bo you have any cash?

Max shakes his head.

JULIO (CONT'D)
Listen, you can have everything I
have, but a ticket from Spider is
like 90, IE don’t even have halt
that yet, I been saving. Any other
coyote will probably be double.

MAX
I don’t want your money. I just
need to see Spider.

EXT. SPIDER‘S LAIR ~ NIGHT

In the baddest area of the LA favelas, we find Spider’s lair.
Thumping reggaeton spills cut into the night aix. Max and
Jalio push their way through the busy sidewalk to the lair.
34.

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR

A fat BOUNCER sits in front of a dented steel door. GANGSTERS
lounge with GIRLS in skimpy clothing, maybe prostitutes. Max
and Julio approach the bouncer.

JULIO
We need to talk to Spider.

The bouncer ignores Julio, keeps chewing on his toothpick.

MAX
Heey..-

Max's voice is breaking from the sickness.

MAX (CONT’D}
Hey, asshole. We need to get in.

The bouncer carelessly motions to another THUG who sits on a
plastic produce box, with an AK47 slung across his chest. He
gets up and uses a metal detector on Max and his chum.

THUG
Clean.

The bouncer waves his fat arm without looking at them. The
thug pushes the steel door open and Max enters.

Max and Julio walk into the lair. The halls are bustling with
people. Max and Julio walk past hookers and dealers.

Max knows where he is going, he’s clearly been here before.
They finally reach a door leading to a large room, and enter-~-~

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR MISSION CONTROL —- NIGHT

The mission control is where the illegal shuttles are
Launched from. The room is a strange combination of wall-
sized plasmas and a favela. Litter and exposed brick next to
super computers and monitors displaying flight routes.

TEN TECHIE GANGSTERS are working on computers.

It is the cpposite of the clean, pristine CCB CONPROL ROOM.
We see a MAN orchestrating the scene, he sits in a chair. He
leans back throwing a footbali up toward the roof and
catching it. This is SPIDER. A walking stick lies next to his
chair. One of his legs is paralysed. Despite his disability,
he is muscular, powerful, almost regal in his shabby throne.

As the ball lands in his hands, he looks over at Max.

 

 

 
 

 

 

SPIDER
You lock like shit.

Julio helps Max into the room. He collapses into an empty
chair, knocking over some cans and bottles and a keyboard.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
Goddamn, watch yourself.

Spider leans closer te Max, looking at him.

SPIDER (CONT’D)
What the hell's wrong with you?

 

MAX
T’m sick, I....i’m dying.
SPIDER
Interesting.
MAX

I need to get up there. I can pay
you back when I’m cured, when I’m
better. Then I can do whatever you
want. But I need to get up there.

Spider leans back in his chair. He starts laughing. Some of

the other techie gangsters start laughing with him,

SPIDER
Oh man, that is priceless. You
think you just waltz in here and
demand a ticket, and I’m going to
give it to you like I’m some kind
of magic genie that grants wishes
or some shit? Maybe I can lend you
my flying rug too.

He laughs. Max gets really close to Spider's face.

MAX
How many jobs did I do for you? How
many? I’m asxing for help here, I
need help Spider, please.

SPIDER
Do you have any idea how many
idiots come in here saying this
same bullshit? Do you think I’d be
able to put food in my children’s
mouths if I ran a fucking charity?
The fuel alone is more than 85% of
what I charge. And forging an
identity for you?

(MORE )
36.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
That‘s two progremers for six days
straight. Who's gonna pay for that?
SERIOUSLY get the fuck out.

Spider turns back to the tech guys.

JULIO
I teld you. Let’s ge.

Julio starts helping Max up. They are moving toward the door.
Spider returns to throwing his ball up in the air and
catching it. But suddenly he stops.

SPIDER
Wait... You said it’s terminal?
This disease thing?

MAX
Yes.

Spider tosses the ball in the air, catches it as he thinks.

SPIDER
You willing to take a chance then?
There’s something I always wanted
to do, but no one had the balls to
do it.

Spider grabs his walking stick and hobbles over to them.

JULIO
I don't like the sound of this.

MAX
What is it?

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR ARMORY

Spider leads them inside. Serious guns and ammo lie all over
the place. Spider goes over to a pile of tech and starts
cummaging for something. He finally’ pulls out a small device:

SPIDER
Here we go.

The size of a matchbox, it has a tethered tail of wire caked
in old blood. He puts it on the table in front of them.

SPIDER (CONT’D)
That my friend, is your ticket up
there. One last job for me, earn
your way up.

 

 

 

 

 
 

37.

MAX
What is it?

eans back against the wall, getting more comfortable.

Max shakes

 

 

SPIDER
Take an Elysian asshole, a
billionaire, he’s down on earth
doing some business, whatever. We
hijack him OK?

MAX
Fuck that.

SPIDER
Relax. It gets much worse. Forget
his watch, forget his ride, forget
all that shit. (he taps his brow)
This is what you take. Organic
Information right cut of his head.
Bank codes, passwords, log in data.
Aecess to billions. We got a few
hours before they figure it out and
switch the codes, you‘ve extracted
enough to fund your own army.

his head, points to the data-port.

MAX
You know what the failure rate is
with those?

SPIDER
Yeah. Tt’s why all these pussies
always bail on me.

MAX
We couldn't even get into a
hospital to install it.

SPIDER
No no, HOSPITAL? What the fuck? My
guys are very skilled. You don't
have to worry.

JULIC
Your GUYS? Are you kidding?

SPIDER
Hey. These boys can hot wire a car
in under ten seconds.
38.

JULTO
So that means they can perform
brain surgery?!

Spider looks at Max.

SPIDER
C'mon, you know it’s your only
eption. You do this for me, I
guarantee you a clean ID and a
ticket up there. All you have to do
is walk inte a house and use the
med bay. Bingo, you’re cured.

MAX
You swear?

SPIDER
on my children’s life. Once we
verify the data, I'll give you a
one way ride, all expenses paid.
I’ll even throw in snacks and a
drink.

Spider smiles, continues~~

SPIDER (CONT'D)
Sandro will do the surgery, he’s
good, we do it right here. But
actually...

He xummages through more tech for something. He finds it:

A HULC SUIT. A metal exoskeleton that fits to human limbs. It
looks like a clump of STEEL, a dirt~bike chassis with joints.

SPIDER (CONT’D)
You seem all weak and fucked up, so
I’d have them install this too,
you're already under the knife
right? Ensure mission success.

He slaps the HULC suit.

SPIDER (CONT’D)
Shit is hardcore. Last guy blinged
it up a little, but it runs real
good,

The HULC on second inspecticn has been “lowridered.” Chrome
and sparkle green paint with gang artwork. Max considers.

 

 

 
 

 

39.

MAX
E pick the team, I don’t want your
attack dogs turning on me when
things go bad, and small numbers,
just four of us.

SPIDER
Nah, I'm sending my own data
wrangler, I don't want to fuck this
up, brain to brain data is real
tough. Small numbers, yeah sure.
I'1l1 give you Manuel, BALLS oF
STEEL. You want him around. So
that’s two plus you.

MAX
Do you know who the mark is?

SPIDER
I got some ideas, some rich
business guys.

MAX
No. I know who it is. I know
exactly who it is.

SPIDER
Oh yeah? Who you thinking?

MAX
John Carlyle.

Spider starts laughing. Julio looks down shaking his head.

 

SPIDER
The CEO of Biosphere, CARLYLE?
That's better than any shit I
woulda came up with. Fucking guy
BUILT Elysium, built their
operating system, built the police
droids. You aim high son. Good job.

MAX
Yeah. He’s gonna pay.

SPIDER
Okay, you can shoot this
motherfucker, stab him, do whatever
you want, just don’t damage his
head, Then you plug into his brain,
Sandro copies the data to you, and
bingo. You’re sipping margaritas on
Elysium by sunset.
40.

 

Spider starts to move, but-~

MAX
T want another ticket.

Max points at Julio. Spider slows.

SPIDER
And if I say no?

MAX
Gocd luck finding somebody else.

Spider looks at Max, knows it’s non-negotiable.
SPIDER
Alright. Two tickets up there.
Thirty minutes, downstairs.

Spider leaves the room.

 

JULIO
You can’t seriously be considering
this.

MAX
You know a faster way to get up
there?

Jelio has no answer. Max gets close to him.

MAX (CONT'D)
This is it, man. This is our ticket.

EXT. SPIDBR‘'S LAIR ~- NIGHT

Gangsters mill about. Laughing. Smoking spliffs. A bevy of
young favalitas flirting with them. We see a wiry gangster
MANUEL among them. The fat guard sits with his AK47.

FREY approaches the lair. She wears a hoodie over her nurse's
uniform. She pulls out a crumpled piece of paper with an
address. She looks up at the lair and triple checks the
address. She watches the seedy patrons of Spider‘’s world.

She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a wad of cash. It's
clasped together with a rubber band. She looks down at it.

And then puts it back in her hoodie. One of the tatted thugs
suddenly spots her. He is swigging from a tequila bottle.

THUG
Hey, hey Baby.

 
 

 

 

4i.

Frey turns away.
THUG (CONT'D)
i ain't seen you around, Hey where
you going? Come back here.
He starts walking after her. He grabs her arm.

THUG (CONT'D)
I SAID....where you going?

She tries to tug her arm loose.

FREY
Please. Just let go.

THUG
C'mon, don’t be like that. I can be
real friendly.
Manuel sees what's happening.

MANUEL
Hey! Marco, let her go.

Prey rips her arm free and briskly walks away. The thug
laughs and holds up his tequila.

THUG
What? I just wanted to talk.
As Frey turns, she sees a silhouette in one of the windows of
the lair. It’s MAX. Their eyes meet. She's not surprised to
see him in this criminal world.

She lowers her head, and walks away. He watches her go in her
uniform, the one clean thing in this dark, dirty world.

INT, ELYSIUM - RHODES HOUSE - DAY

REODES enters her house. A ridiculous palatial mansion. She
puts her keys down on the marble center island. She tosses
her jacket over a chair as she walks out to--

EXT. RHODES HOUSE - DAY

Rhodes walks by the marble and granite infinity pool. Her two
little DAUGHTERS sit on the grass playing with dolls.

GIRL 1
Hi mommy!

RHODES
Hey sweetie.
42.

 

GIRL 2
How was your day?

REODES
Tt was...difficult, sweetheart.

GIRL 2
Do you want to play?

RHODES
In a minute. Mommy’s got to make a
call first.

She sits down at a patio. Her daughters go back to playing on
the grass in front of her. She dials into her wrist device.

RHODES (CONT’D)
I hope I’m not intruding. But we
need to talk.
INT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY - CEQ OFPICE - DAY

Carlyle stands in his office. Rhodes is visible, an image
projected in front of him.

CARLYLE
No intrusion. Go ahead.

 

RHODES
I’ve had a bit of a setback.

CARLYLE

Carlyle looks over at a computer server array.

CARLYLE

What do you think I’ve been doing

RHODES
t’m afraid that's not going to be

CARLYLE
Weil I don’t feel comfortable
moving this data if it’s not wired

too risky.

RHODES
Unfortunately, that’s how it's got

Carlyle tightens.

CARLYLE
I’m sorry, Secretary, was that an

Rhodes bites down, trying to stay calm, respectful.

confidence you can figure it ont.

CARLYLE

Well that’s very assuring, but it
took me decades to make that

supercede that. We're not dealing

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR - NIGHT

Julio and Max walk through dark, dirty halls following Spider
to a staircase descending deeper into the lair.

INT. SPIDER‘S LAIR SURGERY - NIGHT

Yhe basement level reom looks like a veterinary clinic,
covered in graffiti. In the center is a makeshift surgery bed
and several stainless steel tables of old medical equipment.

Around the table are three GANGSTERS wearing green medical
aprons over baggy pants. One of them pulls his mask down to
speak. His face is tattoced. He is smoking a joint. He takes
it out, looks at Max.

SANDRO
Is this the guy?

SPIDER
this is him.

The other gangsters laugh. Sandro takes a drag.

SANDRO
Shit, we gonna cut you up real
geod,

SPIDER

Play nice, Sandro, play nice. And
let’s get him an ID first.

Sandro yells back at the guys.

SANDRO
Ok man, let’s get the chief one of
them identification codes!

One of the “surgeons” hands Sandro a device that locks like a
nail gun. The end has a laser lens.

SANDRO (CONT’D)
Wrist up, bitch.

Max extends his wrist. Sandro places the device over it. He
clicks the trigger, the tip of the device burns the ID into
Max. There is a slight amount of smoke. Max grits his teeth.

SANDRO (CONT'D)

Sandro holds the small data port in his latex gloved hand. He
taunts Max with it. Max doesn’t respond. He just starts
taking off his shirt. Slow, steel. Resolved,

MONTAGE - MAX is naked in a tiled recom as they hose him down.
His hair is shaved. They draw incision lines on his bald
head. We see computer monitors of vitals and internal images.

SANDRO (CONT'D)
Move it over to vivisection.

MAX lies on a surgical table. Sandro stands over him. The
other gangsters are getting ready. We see carts wheeled in,
full of the most godawful looking saws and instruments.
MAX
When this thing is installed, will
it hurt?
The gangsters laugh.

SANDRO
Yeah bitch, it’s gonna hurt.

A gangster grabs Max's hand and shoves a needle in between
his fingers. Max winces in pain, but doesn’t make a sound.

SANDRO (CONT’D}
Yo, Pablo, d’you got the bone saw
down here?

PABLO
Nah, it’s upstairs man.

SANDRO screams up the stairs.

GANGSTER
You gonna be a cold blooded killa.

Sandro looks over at Julic.

SANDRO
You should take a walk now.

He looks at Max who looks back. Max smiles. He gives the
thumbs up. Julio nervously smiles back.

SANDRO
Ok...he’s out...bring in the ENDO.

A large robotic bone-saw comes down and saws off the top of

He points up to a shack high on the hill. A YOUNG GIRL leaves
carrying laundry.

OLDER BOY (CONT’D)

Make sure it’s something that makes

me believe it’s hers.
Max looks embarrassed. He leaves holding his head down.
He sneaks up the street. As he gets closer to the house, he
starts stalking, making sure the girl doesn’t see him. He
hides himself behind a wall, and sneaks into~-
INT. SHACK ~ DAY
Max creeps into the girl’s room. He starts looking through
her stuff. She has very little. He opens a drawer in the
dresser, a small worn woman’s WATCH sits alone.

He steals it. He turns to leave but...the GIRL stands at the
door holding the laundry basket looking at him.

YOUNG GIRL
Please Max. Please. Give it back.

Max runs for it and knocks her over as he races away. As he
disappears into the hazy favela, we return to....

Dogs bark, sirens on the horizon. The dawn air looks crisp.
INT. SPIDER’S LAIR

A smali window lets the morning light in. Max is lying on a
garney. His head is bandaged. He slowly painfully sits up.

The HULC suit servos whine as he moves. He feels the
aluminium cladding over his body. IV cables dangling.

He looks out the window, sees kids playing with a tattered
soccer ball. Feral dogs. He looks up into the morning sky to
ELYSIUM floating peacefully.

He slowly raises his hands to his bandaged head, he starts
pulling the bandages away. Julio enters the room.

JULIO
Whoa whoa, don’t do that, hang on.

Julio turns to yell up the stairs.

JULIO (CONT'D)
Hey HEY! He's up.

Julio walks over to Max, looks at him.

JULIO (CONT‘D)
You OK man?

Max shrugs.

JULIO (CONT’D)
Dees it hurt?

Max slowly nods.

JuMP CUP: a dirty GHETTO CHICK hands Max a glass of water and
a handful of pills.

GIRL.
They said you gotta take em all.

JUMP CUT: Sandro checks Max's eyes with a doctor‘’s penlight.

Spider enters the room. Max is looking at the joints where
the HULC is bolted through his flesh into the bone.

MAX
What is this...?

Spider looks at him, smiles.

SPIDER
Your way out.

EXT. FAVELA - MORNING

Julio stands in the morning light. A cigarette dangles from
his lips as he caresses the fresh ID on his wrist.

Manuel and Sandro lean up against their crime vehicles. They
all watch Max come slowly toward them.

 

 

 
 

 

 

MANUEL
What's up, partner?

He goes in for a gangsta style shake, Max reciprocates.

MANUEL (CONT’D)
I’m your wingman today, How's that
suit working out for you? I always
wanted one. Surgery scares me too
much. But fuck me. That is tight.

MAX
Where are the guns?

Manuel takes a final drag, flicks the cigarette and pulls out
his heavy duffel bag. He slams it down on the hood of the
car, ungips it and pulls out an old AK47. Hands it to Max.

MAX (CONT'D)
What is this? Family heirloom?

MANUET,
No no, wait for it.

Manuel ieans into the bag and pulls out a few magazines. He
pops some of the rounds out into his hand. They don’t look
like normal bullets at all, more Like miniature tank rounds.

MANUEL (CON'T’D)
Aix bursting ammunition.

He takes the gun from Max and hands him the bullets. He lifts
the AK and shows Max a crazy Russian attachment at the end.

MANUEL (CONT ’‘D)
Designate your enemy (click button)
and any round you fire will explode
around them, five meter kill
radius, that shit will fuck you UP.
Max takes the gun and practices hitting the button.

MAX
Emm. Yeah, this’11 do.

Max climbs into the GYR and Julio hops in the driver's seat.
Manuel hops into the pickup while Sandro fires up the engine.

wrist vibrates. She casually pulls her sleeve back revealing
a Patek Phillipe wrist iPod device. It reads:

INT. BIOSPHERE FACTORY - CARLYLE’S OFFICE

Carlyle sits down at the large server array. He opens a small
USB style socket in the computer. He plugs a wire into the
socket, he then feels around next to his ear. The same SOCKET
exists in his head. A wetware interface. He plugs it in.

A small blue LED lights up next to his ear.

No.

JULIO

Well I fucking am, ok? [T haven‘t

MAX slowly extends his newly augmented arm. The hydraulic
pistons hiss and whir, hinting at the immense power. He drops
his hand down into his lap. Looking at it.

MAX
Actually, maybe I am.

Julio looks at him, smiles.

JULIO
Yeah, see you’ve had this stone
cold thing going on since last

Carlyle looks out of the bulletproof glass. His judging eyes
watching the decrepit world of LA passing him by while stock

Burrito stands and beggars. Filthy children and feral dogs.
The LIMO slows at a stop. A donkey-—drawn cart wheels by in
front. Carlyle looks over to see a child at the glass window.
Hand outstretched. Carlyle turns away. The LIMO accelerates.
More kids, poverty, pollution pass. Then SUDDENLY~-

SCREEEEECH. SNAKE’s pickup truck SLAMS its brakes up ahead.
CRAAASHBH! The LIMO dives into the back of the truck.

The gun opens fire at Max, TEARING UP the hood and windshield

Manuel hops out of the pickup holding a SLEDGE HAMMER. He
hops onto the hood of the LIMO and wields the hammer behind
his head. He takes a MASSIVE swing, BANGGGGI

He smashes the gun off its turret, it sparks and blasts to
pieces.

He looks through the bulletproof glass at Carlyle’s terrified
face. Manuel smiles and taps the glass with the hammer.

I’ve got a situation here.

IN?, GTR - CONTINUOUS

Max dives back behind the GTR holstering his handgun and
getting the ferocious AK ready.

Suddenly, the DROID side door of the limo opens. The first
droid moves out like a combat veteran, firing at Manuel.

It targets his face in a millisecond. BANG BANG. Two shots
CRACK his face visor, in what would have been a killshot.

Manuel drops violently, locking owt through his cracked face
plate. He returns fire in a panicked spray. The bullets ping
off the droid's metal shell.

 

In one motion, the droid leaps behind the limo, unclips a
GRENADE and tosses it at Manuel.

MANUEL
YOU GOTTA BE SHITTING ME.

He dives as the grenade goes off, sending him flying back.

Max dodges the shrapnel. fhe droid turns and fires from
behind the limo. Max turns the proximity fuze device on.

MAX
Let’s see how you do against this.

Max targets and fires a burst in the direction of the droid.

ULTRA SLOW MO: the droid lifts his gun to fire back, but the
small bullets come spiraling in, each of them detonating into |
miniature airborne claymores. A magnificent shower of gold
shrapnel, as the droid is tern to smithereens.

Sandro ducks behind the PICKUP, he has the Laptop connected
to his chest armor, booting up. He gives a go sign.

Max gets up and runs toward the ravaged limo. Julio runs
around the back of the pickup, breathing heavy.

Manuel rises, gces for the pickup truck. Max looks over at
Sandro who is holding a LASER DEVICE.

MAX (CONT'D)
Go go go! Cut it open!

Sandro jumps out with the LASER. Manuel covers him. Sandro
lifts the beast cf a LASER and aims at Carlyle’s door. A
bright red circular target is projected onto the door.

MAX (CONT’D)
HIT rv.

Sandro presses the trigger. FIIZg4. The entire door area is
MELTED free in a millisecond, the shape of laser cutting

across door and body alike. The huge steel plates clang onto
the road, smoking, leaving Carlyle exposed, drenched in sun.

Suddenly the opposite side door opens and the second SECURITY
DROID hops out with amazing specd. BRRRR, he fires a burst
straight toward Manuel. Manuel dives behind the pickup.

He flips the VISOR down on his helmet. It synes with the
camera on his gun. The droid keeps firing at Manuel, but--

Manuel sticks the barrel of his gun AROUND the pickup. He
sees the droid in his visor, and he unloads on it, shredding
its mechanical legs. As it goes down, it lunges at SANDRO,
hurling its legless torso at him, grabbing the LASER DEVICE.

They wrestle with it violently, suddenly it goes off aimed at
the pick-up truck. The beam SLICES the truck in half FLIPPING
one half with glowing red edges over, almost onto Manuel.

Manuel fires wildly at the droid, chewing the entire area to
shreds. Bullets fly dangerously close to everyone.

MAX (CONT'D)
Don’t hit the mark!

Manuel holds his finger down, the 1000 round mag shredding
the street, pinging the limo. Hitting Carlyle in the chest.

MAX (CONT’D}
NOLLL!

Max aims and pulls the trigger, cliek, gun jam.

MAX (CONT’D)
Fuck!

Max tosses the jammed gun and leaps up toward the droid. The
enhanced power of the suit thrusting him through the air.
 

 

MAX (CONT'D)
JESUUUSSSSS!

Ee comes FLYING across and body-checks the droid, ripping it
away from Sandro, tearing the laser out of its grip.

Max and the droid smash up against the limo and struggle with
one another, thousands of pounds of pressurised hydraulic
pistons wrestling, suit vs droid

Max slams the droid up against the limo, using all of his new

synthetic might, he tears the head of the droid off its _
shoulders. Oii and lubricant spray everywhere. Ee tosses the

Kruger clicks his wrist off. He casually takes out a tactical
blade. Ye carves out the CITIZENSHIP CHIP in his wrist. He
pulls the chip out and throws it inte the weeds.

The RAVEN slows and hovers, blowing garbage. It gently
touches down. Like a cress between an Osprey helicopter and a

EOOOOOM!! Phe hood of the GFR is bit with the force of an
IED. It EXPLODES sending the vehicle FLIPPING onto its roof.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM

the satellite imagery of Kruger flipping the car plays to
open mouths in the control room. Rhodes watches silently.

CCB AGENT 4
Jesus. Who the hell is that?

A tracking program on the huge screen reads IDENTITY UNKNOWN.

CCB AGENT
Phat's military tech.

INT. GTR

The upside-down interior is smoky, filled with broken glass,
flames. Max comes to. He can baxely fit through the crushed
window, he uses his jaws-of-life pewer to crumple the car
like a coke can. He drags an unconscious Julio out to safety.

 

EXT, LOS ANGELES

fhe Raven descends, hovering a few feet off the ground.
Kruger hops out, and starts walking to the amoking wreckage,
watching Max pathetically try to save his friend.

Suddenly, another blast of STATIC PAIN grates through Max's
brain. He screams, holding his head.

Max can see the blurred figure of Kruger coming. He staqgers
to hie feet. Like a drunk in a bar, he clambers for a grip on
the concrete. Max pulls out his gun.

Kruger deliberately draws a large, lethal knife.
 

64.

Before Max even has time to realize what happened, Kruger
disarms Max, grabs him in a jiu jitsu position and stabs the
huge blade into his kidney. Max howls and drops.

KRUGER
And now my friend...I'm going to
cut off your head.

Kruger gets ready to lop off his head, but suddenly JULIO
fires a burst of bullets at Kruger’s side. Kruger evades the
bullets and sweeps the gangster’s feet out from under hin.

Max sees his friend go down. Max starts fumbling the magazine
out of his gun, trying to put a new one in.

MAX
Get it together get it together.

Julio takes one last SHOT at Kruger. He misses. And--
WHHM. Kruger drives his knife through Julio’s chest.

MAX (CONT’D)
NOOC0G00000000!

Max stands up and clicks the magazine in place, he cocks the
gan and fires a fresh batch of. fuzed ammunition at Kruger.

But Kruger drops his sword and pulls a device off his chest
armor, it is a DEFLECTOR. As he clicks it on, a faintly
visible force-field surrounds him.

BANG BANG BANG, the lethal rounds explode around Kruger like
Guy Fawkes, but they are violently deflected.

The force of the bullets is still enough that Kruger
stumbles, dazed, like being shot in the chest wearing a
bulletproof vest.

Max turns and runs back to his friend, rolls him over.
NOTHING. A pool of dark blood spills out.

MAX (CONT'D)
No no...nooescceoo!

He looks around in desperation, looks over at Kruger who is
steaming, rising again. Max looks back at Julio. He looks
over te see the RECOVERY TASK FORCE SHIP coming in fast.

MAX (CONT’D)
Please, JULIO, COME ON MAN!

But Julio's eyes flutter.. dead. Max rips himself away from
his best friend, pained, limping as fast as he can.

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

65.

Kruger staggers to his feet. The Raven descends for him to
climb aboard. He looks at CARLYLE, as the wheezing CEO gasps
a few remaining breaths. Kruger aims his gun, and--

BANG! He SHOOTS the billionaire in the middle of his head.
EXT. FAVELA - DUSK

Max runs, clasping his stomach. He darts between old shacks.
He turns back to see Kruger climbing aboard the RAVEN.

 

EXT. LOS ANGELES

As the RAVEN takes off, the smaller recovery SHUTTLE touches
down. Kruger watches as the droids start to leap out.

KRUGER
Good luck!

The droids move fast, guns drawn. They run to Carlyle and
begin treating him like paramedics. A DROID SLAMS a
hypedermic of adrenalin into him. NOTHING. He's dead.

DROID
Citizen has sustained irreversible
damage to multiple brain areas.
Time of death E-EST 17:45.

ON CCB SCREENS: CITIZEN DECEASED.

EXT. FAVELA OUTDOORS

Max limps and struggles through the run-down favela. He hears
the whine of the RAVEN behind him. A single OLD WOMAN leads a
pack of mangy DONKEYS. She stops when she sees Max.

He can barely walk. He drops to one knee, tries to keep
moving. The Gld Woman looks the blocdy gangster up and down.

CLD WOMAN
Policia?

Max looks at her with specks of blood on his face. Nods. She
waits a beat, hearing the sound of the Raven. She slowly
walks the pack of filthy beasts toward him and completely
covers him.

Max lies on the dirt between the horse hooves.

The RAVEN appreaches, hovering Low over the street.
66.

 

INT. RAVEN

Drake works a monitor as it scans all the faces in the area.
We see the targeting system scanning the surroundings,
instantly acquiring the Old Woman and a small herd of
donkeys. Everything shows up in thermo as a hot white blob.

DRAKE
Nothing sir, not showing up here.

EXT. FAVELA ~ DUSK

We see Max hiding under the hooves, the jet wash overhead
howling, dust swirling. He blinks hard, and...

The Raven leaves the area to search other places. Max watches
it disappear. So does the Old Woman. She clicks her tonque
and casually leads the animals away, not even looking back.

Max looks down at his wound. He slowly pulls himself up,
needing serious medical attention. He knows where he’s going.

INT. HOSPITAL ~ DUSK

Frey puts down a bundle of medical forms and stacks them in a
filing case, she punches her time card, done for the night.

 

INT. PEDIATRICS WARD - NIGHT

Frey goes into Matilda’s small area and pulls the curtain
shut sealing them in. She checks all the medical details, and
runs diagnostics on the machines linked to her daughter.

Then Frey caresses her daughter’s hair, and gazes at this
peaceful child. Slowly, Matilda wakes up.

PREY
Hey sweetie.
'
MATILDA i
Hi. t
:
FREY

So, remember how mommy said we
could go home when you get better?

MATILDA
Am I bettex? Can we go?

Frey nods. Matilda starts to sit upright excitedly.

PREY
Whoa, easy, remember we have to be
slow, take it easy.

 
 

 

 

57,

Frey starts undoing the medical gear, forcing a smile.
EXT. LOS ANGELES ~ NIGHT

Max hobbles through a shanty town. Fires burn. He sees the
dilapidated hospital up ahead. He keeps limping.

INT, PEDIATRICS WARD - NIGHT

Frey gently takes cut the IV from her child’s arm, leans
forward and gives her a kiss on the forehead.

FREY
i'm going to get the car, I‘ll be
right back, ok?
EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

Kruger’s Raven hovers over the city. The blanket of lights
twinkling under the VTOL jet.

INT. RAVEN

Kruger leans over a series of monitors. All FLIR infrared.
The images are scanning every single person. He whispers:

KRUGER
Where are you, peasant?

Kruger walks through the jet over to the control center.

KRUGER (CONT'D)
Alright, let's get surveillance up.

Three SURVEILLANCE UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) take off
and fly into the favela. They look like metal birds of prey _
with high-tech cameras fixed into their heads.

T. RAVEN

  

the camera feed from the UAVs is visible on the monitors.

KRUGER
Okay, let’s contain this fucker.
Put up a jamming signal across the
whole city.

Drake types into the keyboard. We see the satellite dish and
radar array on top of the Raven fire to life. The satellite
dishes orient themselves and lock in.
 

DRAKE
Grid is up, sir.

INT. SPIDER‘'S LAIR

SPIDER sits at a terminal eating crisps out of a bag. The
wall screen suddenly goes red with a warning: SIGNAL JAM.

SPIDER
What the hell...? They put up a
net. Ground all our flights!

The techie gangsters check commands on computers. A techie
slams his keyboard and lifts his hands in the air.

TECHIE
We're locked ont. The whole
system's down.
Spider lcoks stunned, confused.
EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS ~ DUSK

Max hobbles through people, on the verge of death. No one
seems to care about him. He gets closer to the hospital.

 

But he sees: A COP standing at the entrance. Max limps
forward, the cop seems to be looking away, the huge glass
doors open. Diseased people bustle in and out.

One of Kruger’s UAVs flies overhead, coming in low like a
hawk stalking its prey. Max sees it, and takes cover under a
garbage dumpster. The UAV passes right overhead, the Little
propellers kicking up leaves and dirt as it hovers.

Once satisfied, it takes off to search the next area,

Max gets up, he watches the cop with eaqle-like focus. He
moves over to the side of the hospital. Struggling with the
pain, he looks through the windows. He catches a glimpse of:
FREY as she walks in the opposite direction.

Max uses all of his energy to walk in that direction. He
heads down an ALLEY, holds onto the wall for support. He
tries to walk more, but he collapses onto a knee.

MAX
c'mon... get up.

Max looks down the alley. A rear exit door is visible.

MAX (CONT'D)
C'mon motherfucker... GET UP!

 
 

 

 

Be forces himself onto shaky legs. He stumbles forward a few
paces and collapses completely, smashing over garbage.

He rolls onto his back. He lies still, looks up into the sky.
He can see ELYSIUM. It’s never felt sc far away.

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Frey heads down a corridor toward a door. She swipes her iD
tag and the door buzzes. She opens it and walks out into-~

EXT. HOSPITAL ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
Frey heads for the garage, but she hears--

MAX
Frey...

Frey stops abruptly, spins and Looks down amongst the
garbage. Max lies curled up in blood. He raises hig hand.

MAX (CONT‘D)
Please...

Frey locks at his wounds and the unbelievable stitches at the
back of his head.

PREY
Max? My god, what happened to you?
Let me get the medics.

She heads for the decor.

MAX
Nol. (coughs) No please...don’t go.

FREY
You need serious help, Max.

MAX
Iocan’t. They'll kill me. Please. I
came here to find you. You have to
help me.

Frey shakes her head.

FREY
There are people in triage who can
help you. Much better than me.
I...F can’t get involved in your
oxime.
70.

MAX
Please...they’1l find me. Frey, I’m
begging you, please...don’t go in
there.

Frey looks at Max, his wounds.

FREY
i'm sorry, EI can’t get involved.
You need sericus attention.

MAX
Not...not in there.

He coughs. Frey looks at him, conflicted.

FREY
You've got to go through the system
to get treatment. I can get the
paramedics out here to carry you
in. IT can help you, Max. Let me.

MAX
No. (weakly) Please. I came here

for you. I need you, Frey...
Frey rises and walks away from Max. She looks straight ahead,

but then stops abruptly and looks back at him, this dying man
in a dirty alley. As she makes her decision...

INT. CCB HQ

Rhodes walks towards us, leaving the control room corridor.
In front of her is the PROTOCOL ROOM. Two armed DROIDS stand
on either side of the airlock. Rhodes walks between them.

She swipes her card and walks into the security airlock. She
types a cede and the second doors cpen.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM

The room is cylindrical and glossy. Housing the most
important computer in ELYSIUM. Rhodes walks across a glass
floor. BARTH is fully visible under her feet as she walks to
a central server database in the middle of the room.

She puts her hand on the biometric reader.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Recognized. Secretary R RHODES.

Rhodes looks around nervously.

 

  

 

  
 

 

 

REODES
E need all files from Biosphere CEO
J Carlyle moved to my data cluster.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Negative. You do not have clearance.

The doors suddenly open. REP PATEL steps in.

REP PATEL
Rhodes.

Rhedes turns, surprised to see him.

RHODES
Don't you have some fundraisers you
should be attending?

REP PATEL
I'm assuming because you're in
intelligence you know that the
weapons assigned to your attack-
dog Kruger were used at that crime
scene today.

Rhodes locks back at him defiantly.

RHODES
Okay.

They both stare at one another.

RHODES (CONT'D)
Do you actually have something to
say? Or can I get back to looking
for these criminals.

REP PATEL
PERHAPS Secretary...you are looking
in the wrong place?

RHODES
Tf you have something to say, just
say it.

Patel looks into her eyes. A beat. Rhodes turns and leaves.
The politician watches her ge.

EXT/INT. PREY HOUSE - DUSK

A small house with burglar bars. Looks like a rough
neighborhood. But at least it's a house and not a shack.
72.

Prey knocks the front door open with speed. She helps Max
ingide. She dumps him onto a couch. He's barely conscious.

The room is bizarre, part house, part hospital.

MAX
Are we.... in your house?

FREY
Stop talking.

Frey goes outside and comes back with Matilda in her arms.
She puts the little girl down in her room.

FREY (CONT'D)
Try and sleep, honey.

MATILDA
I want to see the man. What's wrong
with him?

Frey doesn’t answer. She goes back to Max. There’s a hospital
gurney in the corner of the room. She puts a new sheet on it.

MAX
It's like a...hospital.

Frey helpe him over to the gurney and lifts his legs onto the
bed. Frey starts moving faster, his situation deteriorating.

She grabs heart-rate monitors and medical equipment. She
links them up to Max with lightning speed.

She rips off his heavy tactical webbing, grabs medical
scissors and cuts his shirt off, revealing the knife wound.

FREY
My god.....

He tries to push the wound area shut with his hand. aut
becoming weak, his hand slides away and flops off the table.

FREY (CONT’D)
Max. This is a life threatening
wound. You need to put as much
pressure on it as you can okay?
Help me out here.

MAX
ok.

Max's eyes begin to roll back in his head. We hear the heart
vate monitor suddenly flatline.., BBEEEEEEEEEP.

 

 

NA

 

 
 

 

 

73.

Frey races into another room and comes back with electric
defibrillators. She jump-starts his heart. Again. Again.

Beep...beep...she looks panicked and...... beepbeepheepbeep,
his heart starts.

Frey exhales, knows Max will make it. She looks at him. His
head lies peacefully unconscious.

We slowly PUSH IN on MAX'S FACE. It blurs.
EXT. LOS ANGELES FAVELA — FLASHBACK

YOUNG MAX and YOUNG JULIO and other children play in a city
fire hydrant. They laugh and throw water at one another.

Max climbs up onto the top of a concrete wall. Lying in the
sun. Young Julio sitting down below him.

JULIO
What you doing?

MAX
Thinking.

JULIC

Bout who you can mug?
The other kids laugh. Max squints into the bright blue sky.
He sees ELYSIUM glinting in the sunlight. Although several
hundred thousand kilometers away, it is huge in the sky.

MAX
T‘m going to live there.

Julio and the other kids laugh.

JULIO
You're not going to live there,
SLUM RAT.
MAX
Yes I am. I'm gonna be somebody
someday.
~ JULIO

You think we'll still be friends?
Max turns and leoks down at Julio.

MAX
Yeah man, always.

They slap hands, the same way they did before the heist.
 

INT, FREY HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Max wakes up. He winces in pain. He feels his neck, it’s
neatly bandaged. He leoks down to see his stomach bandaged.

Frey stands at the entrance of the room sipping coffee. She
icoks as though she had no sleep. Max delicately puts his
hand on the bandages where the wound is.

MAX
Thank you.

Frey nods as she sips her coffee.

MAX (CONT’D)
You always see me at my best.

FREY
The blade went into your kidney.

MAX
You live here alone?

FREY
Tt’s a very serious wound Max. But
the more serious part is...your
kidney was already failing. The
wound will be okay, that doesn’t
concern me as much. The real
problem is whatever this is.

She points to his entixe body.

FREY (CONT'D)
I’ve never seen anything like it.
You’re okay now because I pumped
enough meds into your body that you
could get hit by a train and walk
away. But your organs are failing,
one after the next. Your body at
only has a few days before it just
stops running.

 

MAX
A few days?

FREY
At the very most.

Max hardens, snapped back to reality. He SLAMS his fist down
hits a tray of surgical utensils. Frey goes to pick them up.

MAX
I’m sorry, I’m...

 

 

 
 

 

 

75.

Another voice rings out from the next room.

MAPILDA (0,S.)
Mommy?

Max realizes he’s looking at drawings on the wall, a kid’s
painting of a girl in a field of blue flowers.

Suddenly Matilda enters the room. She holds a tattered doll.
The little girl is clearly very sick, small Iv’s still
attached to her wrists. Her hospital bracelet visible.

MATILDA (CONT'D)
This is the man...?

PREY
His name is Max. Mommy knew him
when he was just your age.

MAX
Helle.

Max holds out his hand, along with its HULC stainless steel
knuckle dusters.

MAX (CONT'D)
What's your name?

Matilda looks away from him and nuzzies into her mom’s chest.

MAX (CONT’D)
Too formal I think. The whole
handshake.

PREY
Baby, go watch cartoons, I‘ll come
lie with you soon soon, CK?

Matilda leaves the room, she stops at the door and gives Max
an evil eye. He locks kind of worried. Frey gets up and
closes the door gently. ¥rey stands there a moment.

FREY (CONT'D)
Matilda..... is her name.

MAX
She’s beautiful. Like you. Who‘s her
father? Where is he?

FREY
Dead. Ran around with the same kind
of guys you did... Look, Max, I

helped you. Now I need you to help
me.
 

Frey gets closer.

FREY (CONT'D)
She's in the final stages of
leukemia. I need to get her up
there. Up to Elysium.

Max locks at her, surprised.

MAX
And you think I can help?

PREY
Well... you know who to talk to,
right? T mean you're still involved
in crime obviously?

MAX
Obviously? What is it with you?
i've been--

PREY
Keep your voice down-—

MAX
itve been trying to live like a
decent person, ok? I’ve been doing
the right thing, and this, THIS is
what I got for it.

 

He motions to his wounds, his body.

PREY
Look Max, I don't care how you got
here, I really don’t. But you're
here now. And you have to help my
daughter. I've saved up enough to
get her a ticket up there and an
iD...but I don't have enough for
me, So you have to take her. Take
her with you and heal her as soon
as you land. Then when I have
enough, I’1l come too.

Max leans back in his hespital gurney.

MAX
How do you know I'm going?

She motions to the ID burned inte his wrist.
FREY

That’s not a gang tatt. And 1 saw
you at Spider’s.

  
 

 

 

V7.

Max looks away from Frey. Looks at the drawing on the walls.

MAX
You really have enough money?

PREY
I have enough for her.

Max considers. Slowly turns his head back to Frey.

MAK
Yeah. Okay. I can help.
FREY
fhank you... (she puts her hand on

his arm) Thank you.

MAX
Can T get up?

FREY
Yes. I need to get you some more
supplies from the hospital. I won’t
be long. Can you watch her?

MAX
Yeah.

Frey stands, tightens her sweater. She starts to go, stops.

FREY
MAX...

He looks at her. She tries to hold back her emotion.
FREY (CONT’D)

i think you were sent to me. That’s

what I think.
He has no response. He watches Frey leave the house.
INT, FREY HOUSE — LATER
Max stands, looks at himself in the mirror. He inspects his
body, Looks at the scars. He runs his hand over the bandages.

He moves in close to the mirror looking at his own face.

Suddenly he has a mini SEIZURE. The searing white light. The
migraine. His head wants to explode.

He collapses down onto the ground. Breathing heavy.

His fingers run up to the WETWARE socket in his skull, he
feels it. Like a USB plug in his flesh.
MAX
Gcddamn sons of bitches.

He smashes some medical paraphernalia that rattles about the
room. He lies there. Defeated. Head sideways against the
wall. Breathing slowly. Eyes shifting as he thinks.

His eyes slowly focus. And he gets up.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Max quietly enters the living room. Matilda lies sleeping on
the couch. He watches her for a beat and then...

INT. FREY’S ROOM - CONTINUCUS

Max walks into Frey‘’s room. He pulls open her cupboards.
Starts looking through her stuff. Shoe boxes. Drawers.

Fast jump cuts as he quietly rips the room apart. Finally he
finds a small box with a ballerina on it. He opens it.

We see a ton of MONEY clumped together in neat bills. He puts
the box down on the dresser and sits on her bed.

He looks at himself in the dresser mirror. Stares at himself.
He suddenly grabs the money and counts it. A beat.

MAX
Thank you god.

He puts his hoadie on and buries the money in a pocket. He
quietly walks out of Frey‘s room into--

INT. FREY HOUSE - HALL
Little Matilda is standing in the hallway.

MATILDA
Where's mommy?

MAX
She'll be back in a minute.

MATILDA
You have bandages.

She points to her own bandages on her arms.

MAX
Oh, yeah. We both have them.

The two stand awkwardly. She has a book in hand.

 

 

 
 

 

 

73.

MATILDA
Do you want to hear my story?

MAX
Your what?

MATILDA
My story, It’s about a meerkat.

MAX
A meerkat?

MATILDA
He was hungry. But he was small. So
small. And the other big animals
had all the food, cause they can
reach the fruits. So he had to
watch them eat all the nice foods
and berries cause he so small.

Max feels the money behind his back.

MATILDA (CONT’D)
So he made friends with a
hippopotamus, so he can stand on
the hippopotamus to get all the
fruits he wants. And they eat all
the fruit together.

Max just looks at her.

MAX
Yeah, I wish that’s how it ended.

MATILDA
It is, that’s how the story ends.

MAX
Not in the real world, kid. (moves
for the door) Be right back, ok?

Before she can answer, he’s out the door. He closes it behind
him. Pauses there. Conflicted. Then he walks away.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY

UAV. The computer facial recognition software ID’s him.

KRUGER
There you are.

EXT. LOS ANGELES
The hovering Raven drops fast down to the city.
EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS

Max moves fast, trying to lose the UAV, It flies over him,
fot letting him out of its sight.

Max dives under a concrete OVERPASS to a highway. We hear the
UAV hovering and scanning. Max crawls under the narrow
overpass, and gets away on the other side.

MAX
Christ! Leave me alone!

Max grabs basebali-sized ROCKS and starts hucking them at the
UAV, missing, missing, then PING! He cracks one of the
propellers. It dives onto the ground and bounces down a
filthy embankment. Max. scrambles away.

EXT. LOS ANGELES — DAY

The massive RAVEN flies down.

INT. RAVEN - DAY

Kruger grabs a gun off the weapons rack and loads it. Drake
and Crowe arm up behind him.

INT. FREY HOUSE - DAY

Frey comes into her house carrying medical supplies. Frey
throws the keys on the table and freezes. She slowly looks

She runs into her room. She is about to look in the drawer
when she sees the box with the ballerina sitting on the
dresser. She picks it up very slowly and opens it.

Frey collapses down the side of the bed onto the floor.

PREY (CONT’D)
Stupid stupid stupid.

Matilda is standing at the door.

MATILDA
What's wrong?

Frey uses every ounce of strength to hold herself together.

PREY
Nothing baby. Come here.

She hugs her kid, tears forming in her eyes.
EXT. SPIDER‘’S LAIR ~ DAY
Max arrives cutside the laiz. We notice an unusually large

number of people piled up. Throngs of them, on crutches, in
wheelchairs, sick, dying. Max moves past them.

 

INT. SPIDER‘'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

Max walks down the corridor, sweat beading off his forehead.
It’s loud and crammed with people shouting. Max checks each
room as he passes, searching for Spider.

¥inally he reaches the main room. Spider Looks over at him.

SPIDER
Oh god (moeckingly} somecne call the
POLICE. Jesus, that's the last time
E send you on a mission. Could you
have fucked up any worse?

Max tries te walk right in. A BODYGUARD attempts to stop him.
Max effortlessly chokes him out and tosses him into the hall.
Max marches right up to Spider.

MAX
You need to get me up there, Now.

SPIDER
Bullshit, Manuel said the data is
fucked. No data...no ticket. Now
get the fuck out, and go downstairs
so they can take back my suit.
a2.

Max slams ail the money down on the table.

MAX
$0. It’s all there.

Spider looks at the roll of cash.

SPIDER
Where did you get that?

MAX
Who gives a shit? Put the fuel in
the jet. Let’s go!

SPIDER
We CAN‘T.

Max shakes his head, the words don’t register.

MAX
Phat’s the right amount? That's a
one way ticket. Fuck our other deal!

Spider picks up the cash and hands it back to Max.

SPIDER
THE. ..FLIGHT...SYSTEM...IS JAMMED.

Max stares blankly at Spider, desperate.

MAX
I...f gotta get up there.

SPIDER
Join the club. I don’t mean to be
blunt but you need to get the fuck
out of here. I need to see if we
have a hope in hell, which I
personally don’t think we do, of
EVER getting back online.

Max collapses forward, holding his head. He instinctively
feels the data port scars on his head, rubbing them, in total
frustration and anguish.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
What happened out there?

Max doesn’t seem to hear him.

SPIDSR (CONT’D)
Answer me. How did you manage to
get everyone killed? And corrupt
the data.

MAX
Corrupt? CORRUP?T!? They came
looking for me because of this
fucking data.

SPIDER
What?

MAX
Some kind of CCB hitman came after
me. Said he was going to CUT OFF MY
FUCKING HEAD. For data which
according to you is apparently
fucking useless. Explain that,
genius.

Max starts hitting the side of his head.

MAX (CONT'D)
THIS! This! Stuff in my head.
Codes, numbers, PROTOCOL, every
time I think of it, I see it in my
eyes, like a fucking nightmare!

He forces his thumbs into his eyes, as if trying to stop a
migraine. Spider looks at him.

SPIDER
That‘s.... How can that be.

 

Spider looks back at the monitors flashing NO FLY INITIATED.
He turns back toward Max, putting the pieces together.

SPIDER (CONT’D)
We have to see what's in your head.

MAX
What?

SPIDER
I think we may have caused this.

Spider hobbles over to a computer console, grabs a long cable
and tries to plug it into Max’s head. Max siaps it away.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
Listen, Max...if they are hunting
you, don’t you want to know WHY?
Max considers. The words resonate. He lowers his hands.

Spider plugs in. He fires up a program and the computer scans
Max‘s head. Huge monitors display billions of lines of code.
 

SPIDER (CONT'D)
My god...

MAX
What, what is it?

Spider is speechless. He turns to leok at Max.

SPIDER
They will hunt you to the edge of
the earth for this.

He slumps back in his chair, stunned by the discovery.

MAX
What is it?

SPIDER
We could make every human a citizen
of Elysium. Vhat code gives us the
power to run their whole system.

Max looks down, holding the money he stole.
MAX

Humans could live there? Legally?
Medical? All of it?

 

SPIDER
Yeah. But I don't give a shit about
that, have a nice house, whatever.
I care about the larger picture...
WE CONTROL THEM.

MAX
How the fuck do we do that?

SPIDER
Well...we fly up there, break into
the central server and upload this
into it. This data lets us take
control of every single Biosphere
droid. They have no military, no
police, they only have these
droids. Which means, I control
them, I control Elysium.

Max looks at him
MAX
Break into the mainframe? |

SPIDER
Yes.

 
 

 

 

85.

MAX
The one in Elysium? The most
protected in the universe?
(chuckles coldly)
If you want to kill yourself, go
right ahead. Don’t expect me to go.

Spider hobbles closer to Max.

SPIDER
Listen kid, I can appreciate that
you don’t have the capacity to
understand how important this is.
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY.

MAX
No. You're the one who doesn't
understand.

Max stands up aggressively.

MAX (CONT’D}
I don’t give a shit about your
suicide mission. I just need a ride
up there. You're a taxi service to
me. Get it? You're a fucking BUS.

Max throws the chair out of the way and starts leaving.

SPIDER
You selfish sonofabitch. You hold
the key to flipping the whole
system, and you don’t have the
balls to man up and do it!

Max rips the door open to leave, we see Spider clumsily grab
a tiny stamp of technology off his desk.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
Hey! Don’t you leave! Where are you
genna go? Huh? Go curl up under a
bridge somewhere? YCU NEED ME!

Spider tries to stop Max, his uncoordinated hands feverishly
clawing for a grip on Max‘s chest. However, with a very fast
sleight of hand he sticks a tracking microchip on Max's HULC.

Max effortlessly pushes him back across the room, sending him
erashing into tables, computers. Max points to his own head,

MAX
If they want this thing so fucking
bad?

(MORE)
86.
MAX (CONT'D)
Then they will cut me a deal,
they'li give me WHAT I WANT. A
ticket up there.

SPIDER
Or WHAT?

Max leans down to the knocked-out guard, pulis a grenade off
his kevlar. He holds up the grenade and points to his head.
MAX
Or I'll blow it up.
Max walks out, Spider yells from the floor.
SPIDER
Come back here! You can’t give that
te them.

Spider desperately grabs for a walkie.

SPIDER (INTO WALKIE) (CONT’D)
Stop him!

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR - VARIOUS

We hear SPIDER'S crunchy RT voice echo off gangsters’
walkies. They attempt to step Max as he leaves, but--

He effortlessly takes them out, using the super-strength of |

the HULC, his metal enhanced Limbs flashing in the shadows.
Max leaves bodies in his wake. He turns a corner and faces:
A sea of destitute people.
Refugees waiting for Spider to save them. Fach one needing a
ticket to the land of salvation. They look at Max, deep into
his eyes. A big beat, and...Max starts walking through them.
We can hear Spider YELLING through the open door.
SPIDER
They will NEVER bargain with you,
IDIOT. YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!

Max walks out the front door. The guard knows better than to
puli a gun on him. He just puts his hands up.

INT. FREY HOUSE -— DAY

Frey tucks Matilda into a bed inside her room. The mess lies
about everywhere. Frey starts cleaning it up.

MATILDA
Why are you crying?
FREY
Oh, nothing sweetie just a bad day.
MATILDA
Is it cause of that man? Who was
he?
PREY
He was..... what I thought he was.

Suddenly, they hear whining jet engines. The sound of the
shuttle touching down outside. Frey moves for the door when--

BOOM. CROWE kicks the door open, DRAKE storms the room, guns
out. KRUGER enters behind them.

FREY (CCNT‘D)
What are you -- please no --

Crowe violently takes Frey to the ground, Drake goes to check
rooms. Kruger slowly steps toward Frey.

FREY (CONT’D)}
Who are you? You have no right.
Leave us alone!

KRUGER
Oh...my my...we have no right.

Kruger grabs Frey by the upper arms, pulls her close.

KRUGER (CONT’D}
Where is he?

FREY .
Are you looking for that criminal?
I hope you find him, I hope you
throw him in jail for the rest of
his life!

Kruger smiles, looks at his men.
KRUGER
Lot of anger there, lotaaaa anger
there boys.

Kruger gently feels her hair between his fingers. He lifts a
handful of it and smells. His eyes focus over to see MATILDA.

KRUGER (CONT‘D}
And who is this little one?
88.

PREY.
Please. He’s gone, just leave us. TI
don't know anything, I just helped
him, he was wounded.
Kruger silences her by putting his finger on her lips.

ARUGER
Sbhhhh, I know I know...

Kruger gently walks over and sits next to Matilda.

KRUGER (CONT'D)
And what’s your name?

MATILDA
Mommy...

Frey runs over and picks her up.

PREY
Please...you’re scaring her.

Drake returns to the room.

DRAKE
There’s no sign of him here, sir,

KRUGER
Well, that’s alright for now. I’ve
found something else...

Kruger motions for them to take Frey. Crowe grabs her.
FREY
Not No please! Listen! IE den’t know
anything. I don’t know where he is!
He took everything from me!

MATILDA
MOMMY

Kruger gently caresses the child’s head.

KRUGER
There there, don’t worry little
one.

FREY

LEAVE HER ALONE! I told you
everything I know! What the hell do
you want from me?

Kruger looks at Frey, smiles.

KRUGER
What do I want? Now I want...ycu.
He turns toward Matilda.

RRUGER (CONT‘D)
Both of you. I want a family.

EXT/INT. RAVEN - DAY
The back hydraulic bay doors open. Kruger’s men drag Frey and
Matilda inside. Frey is forced into a seat. A huge chest—
restraint bolts her in like a rollercoaster brace.
FREY
Please don’t do this, please just
let us go, I'm begging you.
Kruger ignores her, turns to his men.
KRUGER
Let's get. comms up with the embassy
team, need FMRI scan in twenty.
fhe rear hydraulic doors seal up. Frey looks to Matilda.
FREY
it's ok sweetie, it’s ok.
Everything’s going to be ok.

For the first time, her words are hollow. And the little girl
knows it. Frey reaches out, pulls Matilda close.

BXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS
Max walks fast through the streets. Suddenly, he sees-~

The shuttle rise up from behind some houses. Max begins
yelling, waving his arms.

MAX
Hey! Hey!! I’m right here. Come and
get me, you sack of shit.

Be realizes they are still leaving. Max runs down the road
toward the area where he escaped the UAV.

INT. RAVEN — DAY

Kruger steps close to Frey, almost kissing her cheek.

KRUGER
I always wanted a wife. I never
could quite settle down, if you
know what I mean. You’1l love
Elysium, feel right at home....and
you (to Matilda) you can have any
pet you want. Even a parrot.

 

Prey tries to push him, but she is bolted down by the chest
restraints. He violently pushes her arms back, laughs.

KRUGER (CONT'D)
You need to have more respect for
me, if we're going to be a happy
family.

BRT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

Max climbs down the embankment to find the UAV operational in
the weeds. He lifts it up. Looks into the lens.

INT. RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

MAX’sS FACE comes up on one of the monitors. They can see him
yelling into the lens but cannot hear any audio.

DRAKE
Holy shit. Sir, you better take a
look at this,

 

Kruger snaps his attention away from Frey. He walks over to
the monitor. He sees Max, then looks to his men.

KRUGER
TURN US AROUND.

EAT. LOS ANGELES
The RAVEN hovers for a second and then rapidly descends.
EXT. LOS ANGELES HIGHWAY - DAY i

Max throws the UAY to the dirt. He walks through a line of
weeds on the side of the highway and leaps onto the road.

The shuttle approaches head on. Max stands in the road.
The RAVEN lands, weeds and garbage spin in its vortex.
INT. RAVEN - CONTENUOUS

Kruger snaps his kevlar vest on, and hits the rear door
button, The hydraulic steel door whines as it opens.

EXT. LOS ANGELES HIGHWAY ~ CONTINUOUS

Max reaches into his pocket and pulls out the THERMAL
GRENADE. He pops the pin. Holds it closed with his hand.

Kruger emerges from the Raven. He walks out into the sunlight
towards Max. Max watches him coming like a hawk.

KRUGER
There‘s my favorite human. What's
that for? I am unarmed, my dear.

MAX
If you ever want to use this
bullshit (pointing to his head),
you're going to do exactly what I
say. You understand?

Kruger stops walking. They stand facing each other. The hot
gun beating down on the road.

KRUGER
it seems as though you hold the
upper hand my friend. Step on board
and let's discuss.

MAX
Boes it lock like I WANT TO DIscuss
THINGS?! Fly me up there. I need
medical attention now.

KRUGER
Fine.

MAX
You can have whatever this shit is
(pointing at head) when I’m healed.

KRUGER
OK. Let's go. Climb aboard partner.

Kruger points to the doorway of the RAVEN. Max's eyes dart
over to the large shuttle and back to Kruger.

MAX
I swear to Christ, you make one
move, I will blow this fucking
thing and myself into red mist.

Kruger nods and smirks.

KRUGER
Let’s go. Let‘’s take you up there
to your new existence.

KRUGER (CONT'D)
Leave this terrible latrine of a
planet. Leave all this behind you.
Get that horrible irradiated body
fixed.

Kruger heads for the Raven. Max grips his grenade and follows
him. Kruger walks into the shuttle. Max enters and sees......

FREY.

Max freezes in his tracks. His eyes transfixed on her. As she
comforts Matilda, she looks at him. Tears run down her face.

FREY
What.........

Suddenly her demeanor changes. She becomes ice cold.
FREY (CONT'D)
You backstabbing bastard. You did
this to us—-—

Kruger covers her mouth, she struggles, only angry muffled
sounds can be heard, Max stands speechless, stunned.

KRUGER
Okay, let’s head out boys!

The rear bay doors seal up with a hydraulic HISs.

EXT. LOS ANGELES

The RAVEN accelerates up into the sky at blistering speed.
INT, RAVEN

Max still holds his grenade. He sits opposite Frey. He looks
at her without blinking.

MAX
T’m....2....F didn’t...

He turns to look at Kruger.

MAX (CONT’D)
Let her go for god’s sake. What che
hell does she have to do with this?

kruger turns to Max and smiles.

KRUGER
Well, you two are obviously old
friends.

INT. SPIDER’S LAIR
Spider hobbles over to a computer. A techie operates it.

SPIDER
Ok, where is he?

TECHIE:
dust pulling it up sir.

The tracking point on Max shows up as a dot on the screen.
TECHIE (CONT'D)
Whoa... he’s airborne. Leaving
earth sir, bound for Elysium.
Spider looks shocked. Then snaps into motion.
SPIDER
Manuel, Rico, fire up the shuttle.
Get weapons, get kit. We're going
up.
INT. CCB HQ CONTROF ROOM ~- DAY

RHODES sits at her desk. Her wrist vibrates. She sees the
number, very calmly and quietly leans forward.

RHODES
Do you have it?

KRUGER
Protocol is onboard.

Rhodes looks around to make sure nobody is watching.

RHODES
t'1ll expect you in 19 minutes.

EXT. SPACE
fhe RAVEN hurtles toward ELYSIUM at 22 thousand kph.
INT. RAVEN

Max watches Frey. He attempts to say something.
 

 

MAX
Frey...

She doesn’t look at him. Max glances over at Crowe, who
stares back, getting uneasy in the Zero G.

MATILDA
Mommy I’m scared.

PREY
Don't worry, everything’s going to
be fine, I promise.
She slowly looks up at Max. Their eyes meet. He looks away.

He grips the grenade so hard his tendons fiex.

He looks around the craft. and his eyes slow on warning
logos: “warning pressurised hull.”

Max looks out the porthole at the vacuum of space. He sees
ELYSIUM coming into focus. Frey looks at him. Hard, bitter.

FREY (CONT'D)
this how you always imagined it?

 

He says nothing. Deeply conflicted.

Suddenly the jet hits the atmosphere of Elysium. Shaking and
reverberating through the whole ship. Matilda starts CRYING.

FREY (CONT'D)
It's ok sweetie. It’s alright.

Kruger goes and sits dangerously close to Matilda.

KRUGER
Tt’s just called reentry. We're
about to land. We’re home. I
promise you, you’re gonna love it.

Max looks out his window. The ship slows, rows of gorgeous
mansions extend forever. His dream, right there,

He looks back at Frey, Matilda. The child terrified, tears on
Frey’s cheeks. Max blinks hard, makes an impossible decision.

MAX
Puck it.

He reels back and tosses the GRENADE all the way up to the
cockpit. It clinks and rolis up to Drake.

SLOW MO: Kruger whips his head over, his pupils dilate. Drake
looks at the grenade at his feet in disbelief.

MAX (CONT'D)
(to Frey) Cover your earsill

Max is free in his seat, he moves fast and grabs Matilda. He
covers her ears and gets into a firm brace position as-~

EXT. ELYSIUM

BOOOCCCOOOCCCOM.

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION tears through the RAVEN cockpit. The
explosion sends the RAVEN screaming downward into the
mansions, crashing into the lawns.
SSSSSSMMMMMAAAAASHHHHHHEH. Frey is shaken around violently,
screaming, but she's held by her harness. Max hangs onto
Matilda for dear life as the impact sends everything flying.
EXT. ELYSTUM

THE RAVEN clips a MANSION, blasting cement dust out like a
meteor hit, it digs into the lawn sending clumps of dirt and
grass hundreds of feet in the air.

Martini sipping BLYSIAN women scream and PANIC, jumping cut
of their hot tub as the ship tears through their garden.

INSIDE THE RAVEN:
Crowe is shaken violently in his harness.

Kruger is unbelted and slammed into the cockpit with car-
crash speed, smashing his head on a steel railing.

Phe behemoth scrapes along, tearing up the Bel Air style
garden, finally smashing into a mansion and stopping.

INT. SPIDER’S UPLOAD ROOM - DAY
A techie sits watching a monitor. He speaks into a mic.

TECHIE
They just went down on the surface.

INT. SPIDER’S SHUTTLE
We find Spider in his own shuttle with Manuel and gangsters.

INT. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Rhodes spins her head around as an alarm rings ingide the CCB
control room. The huge wall screen in the CCB displays a
massive warning: FOREIGN VESSEL IMPACT, BETA QUADRANT.

CCB AGENT 4
What do you want us to do ma’am?

Rhodes abruptly stands and grabs her coat.

RHODES
Scramble a jet for me.

EXT/INT. RAVEN

The dust begins to settle. Electrical circuits spark and
hiss. Max coughs and pulls himself upright, the entire RAVEN
is on its side, the walls are now the floor.

Frey hangs suspended from the roof inside her harness.

FREY
MATILDA! WHERE IS SHE??

Max finds her still in his arms.

 

MAX ;
She’s fine, I got her. :

Matilda is crying.

MATILDA
Mommy !

FREY :
It’s ok sweetie, it’s ok. !

Max looks around the sparking smoked-up interior. He sees
Crowe beginning to stir.

Max goes to Frey, tries ta get her out of the harness, but--~

It won't budge. He runs over to a console of switches and
buttons at the back and hits them, one after the next,
accidentally the rear BAY DOORS hydraulically hiss open.

Sunlight spills inte the smoke-filled interior, along with
ash and embers. Fire from the jet fuel burns outside.

As Max tries to find the button to releage frey, Crowe begins
to rise. Max looks over at him, he looks back at Frey and
violently tries to rip the harness open. It won’t budge.

MATILDA
No! MOMMY: !

FREY
Run, Matilda! RUN I’LL COME FOR

Crowe stumbles to his feet.

CROWES
You’re dead.

PREY
RRRUUUNNNN! It

Matilda runs out the back into the garden. She hides in the
rose bushes.

SLOW MOTION: Drake grabs his huge SMART GUN and harnesses it
into a bracket connected to his chest armor.

Max dives and grabs the NEFLECPOR off a weapons rack.
Drake’s finger on the trigger. CLICK.
Max’s finger on the Deflector. CLICK.

Normal speed: the smartqun unloads an ungodly amount of lead
at Max, the deafening gun filling the interior with smoke.

ULTRA SLOW MO: the builets hit the force-field around Max and
deflect in all directions, knocking Max violently back. Crowe
keeps firing, walking toward Max, never letting up.

CROWE
Die, peasant.

Most of the barrage of lead is sent out of the Raven, tearing
up the lawn sending plumes of dirt up.

EXT. RAVEN

The force of the bullets knocks Max cut of the RAVEN onto the
dixt and the metal subsurface of Elysium exposed by the
crash.

Despite the violence, as soon as Max makes contact with
Blysium’s surface, the mainframe becomes aware of him:

HOLOGRAPHIC icons and data popup all around Max: “deal on
HUGO BOSS,” “amazon account - not registered,” etc.
 

98.

Max falls on his back, the deflector is knocked out of his
hand, the force-field goes away, Max moves like a lightning
bolt toward Crowe, grabbing the huge gun while the psycho
continues firing. Max uses his superior HULC strength and
smashes the gun in two over his titanium covered knee.

With awesome martial arts moves, Max grabs Crowe's arm, pops
his elbow. Crowe howls in pain. Icons and data pop up,
showing directions to the closest medical bay.

Max reaches over to Crowe’s tactical webbing, pulls the pin
out of a GRENADE and kicks him back onto the lawn.

Max moves back inside to help FREY, BOCOOCOOM! A cloud of
blood, dirt and grass is hurled into the air behind Max.

INT. RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Kruger stumbles up, very unsure on his feet. Frey looks at
him, trembles with fear. He slowly pulls two throwing knives.

KRUGER
The pain isn't real.

EXT. ELYSTIUM

Kruger huris the throwing knives with cobra-like snaps. But
Max moves so fast that he deflects the blades in the aix.

MAX
C'mon. You can do better.

Kruger throws a barrage of four, Max smacks three out of the
air, one digs inte his stomach, he stumbles backwards.

in the second it takes Max to pull the blade from his
stomach, Kruger draws his KATANA and comes at Max full force.

He swings his sword like a drunken pro. Max uses the exo-suit
on his wrists and shins as steel shields.

RLINK KLINK. Kruger‘s sword is stepped by Max‘s augmented
limbs. But the sheer aggressive onslaught is too much,
finally knocking Max back to the ground.

The maniac stands over Max, puts a boot on his chest.

KRUGER
I'm going to enjoy this. I’m going
to hand deliver them your head.

Xruger slowly raises the KATANA. Max's fingers outstretched,
feeling for anything, he feels the tactical webbing of the
remains of Crowe, and then his fingers find Crowe's SHOTGUN.

As Kruger brings the blade down, with bullet-like speed Max
grabs the shotgun and uses it as a shield.

ULTRA SLOW MO: the KATANA shatters like glass, glinting
pieces of titanium fracturing and splintering into the
sunlight.. Twinkling in front of Max’s face.

Max spins up and KICKS Kruger so hard, the kick PLINGS Kruger
back against the Raven like a rag doll. The coughing wheezing
maniac drops the remains of his sword, trying ta breathe.
INT. RAVEN ~- CONTINUOUS

Frey watches as the violence unfolds just outside the ship:
Max swings the shotgun up, cocks it and steps right up to
¥xruger who is now lying propped up against the Raven door.
Max puts the shotgun in Kruger’s face.

KRUGER
(Weakly) See you scon...

Kruger smiles, and licks the barrel of the shotgun.
CLOSE UP: Max’s trigger finger... CLICK.

The shotgun pellets BLOW Kruger’s face off.

EXT. MANSION ELYSIUM

An ELYSIAN FATHER comes out cf his house to see Max executing
Kruger. The man panics.

ELYSTAN MAN
Oh god! Sweetie call immigration,
get the kids!

Max drops the gun and suddenly remembers Frey. He goes into-—
INT. RAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Max walks into the smoky interior, and fires his shotgun at
the control panel. BOOM! The ship flickers, the harnesses all
snap open. Frey is released and falls against the wall. She
slumps down. Max moves toward her, but she pushes past him.

FREY
MATILDA!

Matilda races out of the bushes, rushes up to her mom. Frey
drops down and hugs her little girl tighter than ever.

Max turns to the rack of guns in the RAVEN and grabs a
RAILGUN. He sees a MEDPACK on the ammo shelf and grabs it.
100.

He runs over to FREY, about to pull the two girls to safety
when he realizes the beauty and scale of ELYSTUM.

Frey rises slowly, holding Matilda. The three earthlings take
a moment. They have never seen anything like this before. The
stunning torus creates a horizon that never ends.

But Max hears something. He snaps his head over to see: a
HOMELAND DEFENSE RAVEN incoming.

MAX
We gotta get out of here. Now.

He turns to grab Frey, she rips her arm away.

MAX (CONT’D)
Look. I know words mean nothing,
but T promise you right now if you
want to get out of this alive, you
have to come with me. Please.

The HOMELAND DEFENSE RAVEN is coming in fast. Max grabs
Matilda and pulls Frey. They run across the manicured lawn.
The smoking wreckage of the shuttle smoulders behind then.
INT. HOMELAND DEFENSE RAVEN ~ CONTINUOUS

Rhodes stands at the open door. IMMIGRATION DROIDS beer over
her shoulder watching the illegals run across the lawn.

DROID
Three suspects, ma’am.

CABIN SPEAKERS
Dispensing tear gas and net guns.
RHODES
Negative. Use live ammunition,
wound the male, but do not damage
his head. Kill the other two.

DROID

The droid shoulders his SMG and FIRES!
EXT. MANSION ELYSIUM

Matilda screams a3 BULLETS kick up the dirt behind then. They
kace up the stairs of a palatial mansion.

Frey tries desperately to get into the house. All the doors
are locked.

The droids fire again, tearing up potted plants and
shattering tiles. Max turns and fires his RAILGUN at them,
HYPERSONIC ROUNDS tearing straight through the Raven.

RHODES ducks as splinters of metal shatter through the cabin.
Pin-pricks of light poke through the punctured hull.

Frey keeps trying to find a way into the house.
MAX
This way!

Max and the girls run along the side of the mansion, and then
down stairs. The droids fire at them, blowing chunks out of
the earth, kicking up water from the pool.

Max turns and fires, he BLOWS one of the droids away. The
shattered droid boils across the cabin floor. Sparks and
bolts ping around the cabin. Rhodes protects her head.

RHODES
Take him out!

fhe droid mans a huge DOOR-GUN, and opens fire, trimming paln
trees with a beam of lead. Max trips and falls, Frey turns.

MAX
Go go! Keep going!
He lifts his rifle and takes a second to aim. He fires
straight into the wing turbine. The engine explodes! The
RAVEN immediately begins to lose altitude.

Max gets up. As he sprints after Frey and Matilda, we see the
Raven smack into the lawn, like a very hard chopper landing.

INT. RAVEN

Rhodes hangs on as it SLAMS tc the ground and comes to rest.
Warning alarms blare. Rhodes uncouples herself and steps out
of the smoke into the sun. She looks around for Max. Gone.

EXT. MANSIONS

Max and the girls keep running across mansion grounds. Max is
clearly in sericus pain, struggling. Frey looks back.

EXT. MANSION ELYSTUM
Rhedes walks over to the smoky remains of Kruger’s shuttle.

She sees KRUGER‘'S BODY. She takes a moment to look at the
sheer devastation. Then she hears-~
102,

The siow whine of a third RAVEN incoming. She turns to look
at it. She waves her arms, directing it down toward her.

EXT. ELYSTUM MANSIONS

Max and the girls break through a perfect hedge. They race up
marble steps. Max shatters a window and--

INT. MANSION ELYSIUM

Max lands on the marble floor. Frey and Matilda follow. They
hear the roar of the CCB RAVEN outside.

Max silently peers over the edge of the windowsill. He
watches as the Raven screams by overhead, departing with
Rhodes in it. He watches it disappear, then--

Max starts laughing, relief washing over him.

Matilda gets up and runs through the immense house. Max
slowly stands. He walks around taking it all in.

He and Prey walk onto a back deck that looks out at the
magnificence of Elysium. Bright flowers. Shimmering lakes.

PREY
I never thought it could be so....

MAX
Beautiful. Yeah.

A look between them. They made it.

An overhead computer voice begins reading features about the
house. It is for sale. Matilda runs into the children’s room.

MATILDA (0.S.)
Mommy! Come and see.

Frey walks into the children’s room, which is bigger than
their house. It is stuffed with brand new toys.

MATILDA (CONT'D)
Please can we stay?

Max enters the room. As he looks around, we see a FLASH of
his ORPHANAGE. We cut back to the room and-—

Suddenly Max DOUBLES OVER in pain. The barcode on his wrist
lights up for a second as the house scans it. BEEP.

 

 

 
 

 

 

OVERHEAD VOICE
RUNNING MEDICAL SCAN...completed.
Please report to the medical bay at

Frey rushes over to him. She feels for his vitals.

FREY

She lifts him up, he winces in pain.
INT. CCB HO

We follow Rhodes as the CCB droids waik behind her. They
carry KRUGER in a body bag. They move through a door to--

INT. CCB ARMORY

The large high-tech room is a mixture of equipment and
weaponry. Two CCB MEDICAL DROIDS stand waiting. Rhodes waves
the droids carrying KRUGER in. They dump the body on a table.

RECDES
Fix him.

The droids pull the bodybag off Kruger. His wound seems
beyond the point of repair. The medical DROIDS grab plastic
packages, they break the seals and pour the white powder
contained within all over Kruger’s destroyed face.

A robotic ultra-violet light begins interacting with the
powder. Magically we see Kruger’s face begin to regrow. As
this happens, the droids begins linking up IV’s and sensors.
Starting the heart again. Getting the body back online.

MED ROBOT
Blood flow is looking good.

The body starts breathing, then its eyes open. The droids
start pulling off all the medical sensors. KRUGER’S face is
complete. As good as new. In fact, better. No scars.

INT. MANSION ELYSTUM
Frey helps Max into the medical room while Matilda watches.

The room looks like a hospital MRE ROOM designed by
poggenpohl. There is a medical table.

  

Frey knocks the flower jars off and puts Max down. There
one large button. She hits it. A laser scans Max‘s FAKE ID.
A holographic menu pops up. A choice of cosmetic upgrades.
 

OVERHBAD VOICE
A variety of health upgrades are on
offer. We have a sale at the moment
in the Armani range. Please make

Max looks at Frey and Matilda. He touches the Armani logo.
The overhead cover begins coming down. Closing Max inside.

EXT. MANSION ELYSIUM

SPIDER‘S graffiti-ridden ship comes in fast and lands on the
lawn outside the mansion. Spider hops out. Manuel and Rico
hop out with him. Spider looks back into the shuttle.

SPIDER
fake off, give them some exercise.

The shuttle takes off behind them and leaves.

INT. MANSION ELYSTUM

Spider smashes the door open. He walks inside following his
tracker. it leads him to the MED BAY. He sees Max about to be
re-atomized and healed.

SPIDER,

 

NOULL

Spider lunges forward and uses his gun to jam the machine
from closing. He hits the CANCEL button.

MAX
What the fuck are you doing? What
are you doing here?!

SPIDER
You can't do that. Not yet. It'll
destroy the data.

MAX
I don’t care about your fucking
DATA. I'M DYING. Do you know what I
went through to get here?

i
!

SPIDER
Please....If you‘re re-atomized
now, it‘ll scramble the data. You
can‘t heal yourself, not yet.

MAX
Are you kidding? Get the hell out!

Max tries to push him away.

 
 

 

 

105.

SPIDER
Will you Listen? There's another
way. There’s another way asshole!
Matilda cries, the fighting getting to her.

FREY
Let's get you out of here.

Max throws Spider from the med bay. Spider knocks over plants
and vases, smashing them. Matilda starts trembling.

FREY (CONT'D)
Baby? Hey sweetie?!

MAX
Get out! GET the hell our!

fhe gangsters point their AK47s at Max.

RICO
I’m gonna waste this motherfucker!

SPIDER
NO! NO!! Don’t!

Matilda's eyes roll back. She is having a full seizure.

FREY
MATILDA? MATILDA! !

Max and Spider end the gangsters all stop and leok at the
little girl. Prey stands up frantically.

FREY (CONT'D)
No! Nott

She grabs Matilda, rushes to the medical bay and puts the
child down gently. Spider is helped up by the gangsters.

FREY (CONT'D)
Please god, don’t let this happen.

She hits the ANALYZE button. There is a loud error BEEP.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Error, no citizen detected.

FREY
NOOOO!!! PLEASE! !!!

She violently hits the button again.
106.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Error, no citizen detected,

Frey starts hitting the machine.

PREY
PLEASE!

She SMASHES the button again.

OVERHEAD VOICE
Exror, no citizen detected.

She looks at Max.
FREY
GIVE HER YOUR CITIZEN CHIP! YouR
ARM! GIVE IT TO HER!
Max looks down at the ID burned into his arm.

SPIDER
He can’t. It’s coded to his DNA.

Frey collapses onto her knees beside the table. She chokes
back tears. She strokes Matilda's hair.

PREY
Just hoid on baby, mommy will find
away. Just hold on.

Max looks out at the sprawling estate. The manicured lawns
extending for ages. The magnificent curve of Elysium.

Then he turns back to Frey and Matilda.
MAX
Ok... (turns to Spider) If f do
this, it‘ll help her right?
Spider nods. Max looks back down at his broken body.

MAX (CONT'D)
Let’s get on with it.

INT. CCB MED-LAB

KRUGER is now alive. The MED BOTS disengage the cables that
suspend him, and he collapses like a marionette. Slowly his
fingers uncurl. His muscles tremble as he rises to nis feet.

RRUGER
Christ I hate rehabilitation.

 

 

 
 

 

 

107.

He looks around, slowly walks over to a row of sinks and
mirrors. He checks out his reflection.

RHODES
Do you realize what you‘ve done?
You crashed a CCB vehicle into the
Bryanston sector!

Kruger continues to look at his new face.

KRUGER
I hate how new it is. Like a baby.

REODES
I hired you to be covert! You know
hew much I have to clean up now?

Kruger suddenly punches the mirror. The broken glass cascades
everywhere. Rhodes seems momentarily shocked.

RHODES (CONT'D)
Are you listening to me?

Kruger takes a shard of glass and cuts above his eyebrow.

RHODES (CONT'D)

That human is running around here

now, god knows where. We need to

get that data out of his head

before he realizes what he has, or

before the administration realize

what we were doing and hang us both

for treason. You understand?
Kruger admires himself in the mirror, his fresh scars. Ee
looks more like the old Kruger. Rhodes steps closer.

RHODES (COND)
xuger. Have you heard a word I’ve
said?!

Kruger cocks his head, then turns and with lightning speed
& '$_RHODES ‘ THROAT.

SLICE.

Rhodes chokes and falls to her knees gurgling. Kruger throws
the piece of glass, KLINK, it bounces off tiles somewhere.

The med robots stand by. Rhodes cannot form a sentence to get
them to help her. She falls, dead.
108.

KRUGER
Now nobody knows about that data.
Nobody but him and me. Which means,
when I get it, this place is mine.

Kruger grabs a weapon, and steps over Rhodes as he heads out.
IN?P. MANSION BLYSTUM

Max and Spider huddle over a tattered MAP OF ELYSIUM. It is
big, taking up the whole kitchen table. Gangsters look on.

SPIDER

We need to get that data out before
you're healed. The healing process
strips the atoms and realigns them,
it will corrupt the data instantly.
After we extract the data, then
we'll fix you up. Plan is, we break
in, download it, then get you here
right away. (points to map) They
have medical bays in the armory.

Max looks over at Frey and Matilda. Frey has a wet cloth on
her brow, cooling her daughter down.

MAX
You're sure this will work? This
will give them what they need?

SPIDER
Brother. If we do this, humans
become citizens of Elysium. She can
get cured right away. Along with
nine billion others.

Max contemplates the answer. Spider motions to the map.
SPIDER (CONT’‘D)
We drop in here. This is a back
entrance to the control room.
We follow his finger along the illegal map.
SPIDER (CONT'D)
All the way in here. Boom. This is
the protocol room.

MAX
How do we get through these?

He points at the airlocks. Spider reaches into his bag and
pulls out a swipe card connected to a handheld computer.

SPIDER
Run a bypass. I always come
prepared, son.

MANUEL
Goddamn suicide run.

Spider gives a rueful smile.

SPIDER
It's much worse than that.

He locks over at Frey.

SPIDER (CONT'D)
We could use your help.

FREY
I‘m not leaving her.

Spider holds up a headset and laptop.
SPIDER
Just guide us. Real time satellite
feed. When the shit hits the fan in
there, you can be our eyes.
Frey nods. Max stands, lifts an AK47, checks the breach.

MAX
Alright then.

JUMP CUTS: various guns/ammo loaded into pouches. Zipped up,
backpacks on.

They stand at the front door to the mansion. About to leave.
Max takes a headset and earpiece from Spider. He puts it on.
Frey walks over to Max. Quiet.

FREY
Thank you.

Max Looks back.

MAX
Listen... I/m.....0 just....

SPIDER
Let’s go, son.

It's ok...Max...Go.

INT. CCB ARMORY —,
Keuger sits on a medical bench as the MED BOTS BOLT a HULC

SUIT into his bones. Similar to Max. But more expensive. More

high-tech. Like an F22 vs an F14. it’s magnificent.

Once secured, Kruger goes to his LOCKER. Still has his name
on it, He opens the locker and starts pulling out his gear.

EXT. MANSION BLYSIUM - NIGHT

Manuel and the gangsters run ahead into the night. The huge
mansions flood-lit. Max and Spider follow. Guns drawn.

INT. MANSTON ELYSTUM

Frey wears the head-set. She watches them on the laptop. The
access hatch shows up in the satellite data.

PREY
It’s about 20 meters ahead of you.

EXT. MANSION ELYSIUM
They arrive at the still smouldering crash site. Using

flashlights, they find the hatch under the tipped-up earth.
They open it, and jump into the SUBSTRUCTURE of Elysium.

 

INT. CCB HQ

Kruger calmly walks out of the armory. He steps inte the
central corridor. He casually lifts a grenade from a pouch,
pulls the ring and throws it down the corridor. He walks back
into the airlock. BOOCOOGOOOOM!!!! Fire and smoke billow.

INT. SUB STRUCTURE

We hear the deep base rumblings of the explosion.

MAX
What the hell was that?

INT. CCB EQ CONTROL ROOM
Warning lights start spinning. All the ccs agents rise,
Rushing for the exits. The lighting blinks on and off, as
though the grenade has damaged the power source.
OVERHEAD VOICE
All agents, go to the nearest exit
and proceed calmly to ground level.

The panicked agents run out of the ccg headquarters.

 
 

 

 

an

SLOW MO: we see KRUGER move in the opposite direction to
them, walking toward us. He flips his hood down. Deadly.

Int. CCB HO

A hatch opens above the hallway. Manuel drops down and pulis
out his gun. He spins the other way. NO ONE.

He stands like a sentry as another gangster, RICO, hops down.
The CCR is smoky, burning embers floating through the air.

MANUEL
Where the hell is everybody?

Spider is Lowered down by Max. Max hops into the corridor.

FREY (IN COMM)
Okay. It’s to your right.

Spider leads the brigade to the first airlock sealed doors.
He slips his SECURITY CARD into the reader and scans the
code, he types and...ISSSHHHHH the doors open.

SPIDER
Come on, let’s move.

FREY (IN COMM)
Seems clear.

Spider opens the second dcors to be met by more smoke. Max
cautiously checks the reom, waves his gun from side to side.
Clear. They start moving into it. And suddenly~-

Max hears a blood~curdling SCREAM from RICO. They spin to see
him exploded by-~

KRUGER. The gangster is hurled across the room. Kruger's
deadly wrist device sparking and winding down from the kill.

Max lifts his gun and FIRES, but--

Kruger’s high-tech suit MELTS the gun in Max’s hand. Liquid
molten AK47 drips all over the floor.

MANUEL
RUUUUNNN!!! SPIDBR GO!!! TAKE HIM!

Spider tries to grab Max.

MAX
NO! Don’t leave him!

Manuel lifts his assault rifle, pops off a few rounds, but
the bullets just glance off Kruger’s billion dollar HULC.
112.

Kruger casually lifts his wrist, sending a beam that turns
Manuel's gun into ASH. Manuel screams as his hands are burnt.
Smoking embers of burning metal floating around the toom.

Kruger spin-kicks Manuel across the room, the gangster
bounces off the wall like a soccer ball.

MAX (CONT’D)
FUCK THIS.

Max summons his energy, runs toward Kruger and LEAPS.

lie smashes into Kruger, sending them both back, DENTING an
airlock door with 500 lbs of steal exo strength.

Max grabs one of the throwing knives off Kruger’s vest and
stabs it through Kruger’s wrist WEAPON. The device crackles
and sparks. Blood leaking across the white stark ccB.

KRUGER
That’s a cheap shot, that’s a
fucking cheap shot.

Max starts to take the upper hand when....

Max goes inte a white hot flash of cerebral pain. The
epileptic seizure of DATA-OVERLOAD hits him, he trips and
stumbles over desks and terminals, holding his head.

Manuel grabs Max and pulls him back toward Spider.

Kruger xises, whips out a deadly throwing knife and wings it
at Manuel. It digs into his sternum. He drops to his knees.

Spider looks back to see his friend go down, gasping for air.
Spider turns back, hacking the control-reom airlock.

Max sees Manuel die. Anger coursing through his veins, Max
uses every ounce of strength to will himself to his feet,

Kruger lunges at him. His knife comes flashing toward Max's
head like lightning, barely missing his jugular.

Max delivers a sequence of awesome martial arts kicks and
punches knocking Kruger back, giving him time to escape.

Max dives into the airlock and hits the SHUT button. The door
starts shutting. But Kruger leaps and wedges his steel
encased body in between the airlocked doors, jamming them.
He’s trapped there.

Max drags himself away, looking back as Xruger struggles to
free himself. Max and Spider hobble into--

IND. CCB HQ CONTROL ROOM

Max and Spider make their way through the immense, abandoned
CONTROL, ROOM. Walls still flicker with warnings:

ILLEGALS DETECTED ITN CONTROL ROOM.

They reach the next airlock. Max turns back to see Kruger
pulling free himself.

MAX
come on come on--

Spider disengages the door, and they move fast into--

Int. GANTRY ELYSIUM

The gantry is suspended hundreds of meters up, like a bridge
over the immense sub-structure of Flysium. It looks like

something out of STAR WARS. Suge volumes of wind swirl.

Max and Spider hobble along the gantry, MEDBAY and PROTOCOL
station writing in signs overhead. Max looks up, sees:

Kruger keeps coming, a relentless killer.

SPIDER
Come on, keep moving!

Max stops, watches this cold-blooded killer.

MAX
No, no... He’ll never stop.

A calm passes over Max, as Kruger hears down.

MAX (CONT'D)
You got nothing to fight for. I do.

Max and Kruger collide in 4 deadly sequence cf moves.
KRUGER
T have everything to fight for. =
have all this.

Max struggles. But he makes a desperate move, GRABBING hold
ef the NERVE CENTER on the back of Kruger‘’s BULC.

Max tears it off with all his strength. SPARKS explode and
shredded circuitry come out in his hand. We hear Kruger’s
suit power down, and--

Max kicks the living shit owt of him.
   

 

Kruger falls into a crumpled heap. They are at the end of the
gantry, where the ARMORY has MEDBAYS LINED UP,

Kruger looks at Max’s dying body. He looks into the ARMORY,
then back at Max, choking, laughing.

KRUGER (CONT’D)
Your....friend...didn’t tell you
everything, did he?

Max looks at Kruger, confused.

KRUGER (CONT'D)
You think...you can pull that data
out of your head and live? You
think you just carry on with your
little life?

Kruger is Laughing, choking.
KRUGER (CONT‘D)
You fucking idiot... That data will
kill you the second it‘s retrieved.

Max turns to Spider.

 

MAX
What..? Is that...true?

A beat. Spider looks back at him. Yes.
KRUGER
You wanna save...all your little
earthlings...then you’re gonna die.
INT. MANSION ELYSIUM
Frey covers her mouth as she hears them over che comms.
INT. GANTRY
Max looks at Spider.

MAX
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

Kruger laughs with his dying breath.

XRUGER
Dead.... You're dead.

Max gets up in a rage, he grabs Kruger’s BODY and HURLS him
off the edge of the GANTRY into oblivion. Kruger disappears
inte the darkness. For good. Max drops, devastated.

SPIDER
I'm sorcy man, I'm sorry. T didn't
xnow how to tell you. You can still
choose. It’s one or the other.

MAX
I’m not dying here.

Frey listens to the conversation. She looks toward Matilda.

SPIDER
You have the ability to save
everyone, everyone. But i'm not
going to force you, I Know I can’t.
It's right there (points at med
bay)... ¥ou choose.

MAX
And what? I have to die. That's my
goddamn choice?

Spider turns to see the security droids and politicians have
arrived at the end of the GANTRY.

Max gets up and stumbles toward the MEDBAY. Spider SHUTS the
security door behind them as they leave the gantry. He MELTS
the control circuit, sealing it.

 

Max stumbles over to a MEDBAY, and leans against the machine.
His fingers caress the “DIAGNOSE” and “HEAL” buttons.

We hear the sound of cutting metal. Spider locks up to see
CCB DROIDS cutting through the security door.

Max blinks hard. He wipes his face and turns away from the
machine. He looks back at the droids. He limps toward Spider.

MAX (CONT'D)
Let's finish this.

He motions to the final airlock before the PROTOCOL ROOM. He
steps away from the MED BAY, he has made his decision.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM

Spider runs a bypass on the protocol door. The hydraulic door
opens revealing the PROTOCOL CORE, Max stands for a moment,
stares at the space, the inner core of Elysium.

EXT. MANSION ELYSIUM

We Follow IMMIGRATION DROIDS as they load up guns with tear-
gas and run across the LAWN towards Frey in the mansion.
116.

 

IMMIGRATION DROID
Two illegals detected.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM

Max collapses next to the central computer. Spider closes and
seals the door behind them.

fhe glass floor of the protecol room is the final barrier
between the inside of Elysium and space. BARTH looms directly
under them. Max looks down at the world that raised him.

INT. MANSION ELYSIUM
Frey sees Max as a small infrared heat dot on the screen.

She is fighting back tears. She sees the Immigration Droids
coming across the LAWN. She leans over and pulls Matilda
closer. But doesn’t leave the monitor.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM

Spider walks over to the central console and takes out his
little computer, he plugs his USB wire into the PROTOCOL. He
gives the other end to Max. Max clumsily plugs it into his
ewn head. He calmly looks back down at Earth. He remembers
the locket on his neck. He snaps it off, holding it.

 

MAX
Prey.

She swallows and then adjusts her mic to speak into it.

PREY
Yeah.

MAX :
Remember, when I stole your watch.

SPIDER i
Ok, syncing.

PREY ‘
Yeah. :

MAX

i'm sorry about that. It’s just....
I don’t know why I took it, I
wanted to get into that stupid

gang. |

PREY
Tt’s ok.

 
 

 

 

alv.

Max opens the locket, looking at the image of Earth. The same
one he can see with his own eyes now.

Spider types furiously, hacking into the system core. He
looks up to see the DROIDS running to the final door.

SPIDER
Shit. Here they come.

MAX
You forgive me?

FREY
Yes, Max.

BANG. They hit the door. THUMP THUMP, sparks fly as the
acetylene torch starts cutting.

MAX
And then, I stole...... Matilda’s
money. I’m really sorry, I swear.

SLOW MO the sparks drizzle into the room. The security droids
raising guns.

PREY
I forgive you, Max.

MAX
For both times?

FREY
Yes, both times.

INT. MANSION ELYSIUM

The droids smash open the doors to the mansion and enter.
Frey looks up at them on the other side of the house.

INT. PROTOCOL ROOM
The computer screen reads: “PLEASE ENCODE NEW ADMINISTRATOR.”
SPIDER

Spider puts his open hand to the biometric reader. -SCAN-

SPIDER (CONT‘D)

BEBP. SYSTEM READY.
SPIDER (CONT'D)
We're good, we're good--

MAX
WAIT. Give it to me.

Spider hands the KEYBOARD to Max. Max takes it, With his
other hand he drops the locket on the glass fleor. Two
earths, one real one image, hanging there.

MAX (CONT'D)
Frey.

FREY
Yes?

Max looks at the ENTER key. His finger hovers over it.

MAX
Thank you.

SLOW MO: MAX hits the ENTER KEY.

His eyes close. His hand drops to the floor...... dead.

The computer screen fills with billions of lines of code.
BOOM. The door finally gives way. The DROIDS run in. They are
trailed by REP PATEL and a young politician, REP SMYTHE. The
droids GRAB SPIDER violently, beating him.

SPIDER
NO-—

Patel enters the room, aghast to see the immigrants in the
most secure zone.

REP SMYTHE
Kill him!

INT. MANSION ELYSTUM

The DROIDS smash the laptop in front of Frey and violently
rip her from the chair. Another one grabs Matilda.

INT, PROTOCOL ROOM
Computer screen: COMPILED. HUMAN STATUS: ..... + «LEGAL,
INT. MANSION BLYSTUM

tastantaneously, the DROIDS let go of Frey. The code on their
visors suddenly staris scrolling, like a DOS REBOOT.

ENT. PROTOCOL ROOM
The droids let go of Spider and help him up.

DROID

REP PATEL
Arrest him!

REP SMYTHE
Shoot him! Now!

DROID
I cannot harm a citizen of Blysium.

REP SMYTHE
A CITIZEN? A what?!

Spider calmly grabs his handheld computer off the deck.

SPIDER
Guess who Elysium belongs to now,
bitch?

He smiles at the politicians as he leaves. The men look at
each other, knowing their days are over. MAX’S BODY lays
there dead. And we see one final flash of memory:

INT. YOUTH PRISON - DAY

Young prisoners line up against the wall. The WARDEN makes
them stick out their tongues, while he checks for contraband.
He walks up to ELEVEN YEAR OLD MAX.

WARDEN
You again, back for more, hey? Open
your mouth.

Max sticks his tongue out at the Warden, the other kids
laugh. de punches Max in the stomach. Max collapses, lying at
the Warden’s feet gasping for air. The kids quiet.

WARDEN (CONT‘D)
No one knows your name.

The Warden leans down next to him.
WARDEN (CONT‘D)

No one will remember you. You will
never accomplish anything...
INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
Young Max cries. The Nun sits cn the edge of his ratty bed.

NUN
Everyone has one special thing Max,
one thing that they are meant to
do, one thing they were born for.

ENT. MANSION ELYSIUM

Frey gently places Matilda down on the med table. She presses
the ANALYZE button.

OVEREEAD VOICE
CITIZEN M SATIAGO. Female. Severe
epileptic edema.

A soft blue/white light moves up and down Matilda’s body. RE-
ATOMIZING. Frey watches in disbelief as her daughter is
mended. The machine gently opens.

Frey stands with baited breath. Matilda slowly opens her
eyes. She turns and looks over at her mom. 100% CLEAR.

MONTAGE:

Humans all over Elysium come out of hiding. The old, the
sick, all getting medical care in their Mansions.

Shots of humans on earth scrambling for tickets to ships.
SHUTTLES stuffed like Indian trains. Bound for Elysium.

Prey and Matilda play in their garden. The huge orb of Earth
floats behind them. Frey wears Max’s necklace now. She holds
it for a moment. And then continues to play with Matilda...
