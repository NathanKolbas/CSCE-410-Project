Abruptly, his eyes snap out the window. Scereeching arcund
the distant corner, a phalanx of FOLICE CARS.

Forgetting the lullaby, he moves.

# INT. ROOM - DAY
The man’s spiritual brechers sit here scattered. Long
braided hair some, tattened others, pierced all, they sit
telling jokes, playing cards, laughing with each other.

bDen't be deceived. They are, in fact, a rolling army. Wolves,
living on the move, taking what they need where they find it.

A wlance axchanged. Years of experience there.

Synchronized, like a machina, Presten and Partridge move
silently through the house.

A DESPERADO steps abrupely out of a doorway ahead, shotgun

mirroring their astonishment as they counk the fallen.

Werdlessly, Preston turna and exirs.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

The dust has sertled now. It is quiet. FPraston is meat in
the battle-scarred main hall by the Tactics Commander and his
team who have secured the upper fleer.

TACTICS COMMANDER

Preston nods, taking in every detail from floor fo ceiling.

PRESTOK

The Tactics Commander glances at Partridge - who nods with
gimpla gravity.

The Tactics Officer jumps to it, ushering his men streaming
out. Preston turns to look briefly to Fartridae ...

The Special Teams jump quickly to it; stripping away the rug,
splintering up the floerboarding with crowbar.

Revealing, within a jagged hole, atop many other similar |
fized canvasseas, the MONS Ligh. Smiling back at cham with
her quies smile.

Specisl Teams back off to let A MAN RITH GLASSES through. He
kneels at the edge of the hole, swabs an edgé of the painting
with 6 f+tip and dropa it inte a emall test tube.

He shakes it, studying the reactant chemicals. Turns,
nodding with gravity at Freston.

Preston turns wordlessly and walks cut.

He ip our hero.

PARTRIDGE lingers for a moment, Staring at Mona Lisa‘e amile
as it curls up in the flames along with a billion dollars of
mankind’s other greatest artworks.

INT. POLICE VERICLE - DAY

Preston and Partridge ride in ailence in the back of the ~
vehicle, watching the quaint, *ilent neighborhood go by.

Odd, but there isn’t a soul to be seen in this neighborhood.

Every door has been painted with a plaque-era black ‘T’, and
avery Ech or so house, has been buraed to the ground ...
 

Page 6

But it seems ta make no impression on Preston. He looks over
at Partridge, his partner's strong jaw tensed, contemplacive,
as he stares out the window at the empty, passing
neighborhoed. $

Preston studies his partner of many years.

Thare are things Preston can know by simply leoking 2t a
person that would border on mind-reading for the rest of us.

PRESTOR
You're thinking aomething ...

Partridge blinks over from the window.

PARTRIDGE
Oh... mo... nothing ...

He shakes his head, gesturing the vacan= neighborhood.

PARTRIDGE
Why don't wa just burn it all ta the
ground - and be done with it?

PRESTON
Resources are tight. An uneontrolled ©
fire im che gone could spread Eo the city.

Partridge nods. Sure ... Bure ...

Ahead, out the windshield, the suburhan neighborhood abruptly
ends, as though crushed in mid-thought by a giant stone iaor.

A MASSIVE GATE girded by MASSIVE WALLS some 75 feat tall and
stretching off out af sight in either direction like the
Great Wal] of China.

Ater the gate, carved in qramite, massive stone Hitlerfian
letters proclaim LIZRIA. And, in smaller acript below that:
Librium ast iibercas :

Standing atep the precipice, a SENTRY clad in white watches
through the featureleas biack glass of his helmet as Preston
and Fartridge's car is checked through the gate below.

Barrel of his white-metal machinegun following as the car
passes from the faded flower that is the Zone ...

Through the vast, opening doore ...

To the vista of a VAST WALLED CITYSCAPE.

Preston states at the dead man in his arms. Then Looks,
astodianed, to Brandt who nods.

BRANDT
Good grah, Cleric.

And, with a yell, he steps around the comer sheoting -
several Enforcement units blazing away with him.

Preston is left alene - in the ringing aftermath. Realizing

He quickly releases the body.

The guifire and ecreama are gone but fer the echoes now.
Every shot needed, has been fired. Every scream, silenced.
Now Preston does his wark. Wandering through the house *
alone. Searching. Smellirg our that place ...

He fixes on a wall. Approaching it, he gcratches at the
Plaster with a fingernail. It crumbles away easily and, a
moment later, he is stepping into a HIDDEN ROOM.

Instantly, the eye is assaulted with the uncustomary
gensation of COLOR. THINGS, jumbled everywhere. Pictures,
paintings, posters, wall paper, collages, teys. upholstered
furniture...

He looks around ... +

An old Singer sawing machine. A work of arr, really. He
picks up an embroidered pillow - “Bless this Mess" Tacky,
yes, but to eyes hungry for human expression. the highest art -

He allows his hand te fum along the edge of a‘long, ornately
carved table as he woves slowly through the room - past the
framed ciccures of unrelated people, long dead-

Stopping at an ILLUSTRATED CHILOREN:S BOOK. Picking it up.

He blinks, eyes losing momentary focus at the name's

He shakea it off, eyes catching something else. On the FLOOR
in the center of the room. Semething. A slight, almesc
unnoticeable BULGE beneath the shag carpet

Bending, he runs his fingers across it.

He looks sharply up. BRANDT stands there - surveying the

Amidst the carnage, SOMETHING scrambling between the

When he opens them, he finds tha eyes of the DRIVER, an

Preston stands at the open crunk of his Cleric-issued car.

Finally, with fingers that nearly tremble, he opens Ehea box,
picking owt a.bit of RIBRON, Nothing really. Something
you'd cast out without a second theught.

But it captivates him. Staring inte its czimeon depths,
feeling its supple pliancy.

Putting it down, he pulls out her ART BECO PERFUME DECANTER.
As he turns it in his hands, the cut glass splits the light,
creating a rainbow inside its diamond facets.

Tentatively, he sprays a tiny bit it into his palm and

Her death sentence. Through an act af will, he manages to

Then, something, some fissure, cracks behind her hard facade
and her hand reaches for her eyes.

Bur just as quickly, she wipes it away, drawing a crisp
breath - defiant again,

DuPont helds on him another steady beat. Then ncds, closing

DUPONT .

No Sir - I do nor.

Praston wavers - twisting to near-breaking inside. But
ultimately, has no choice but to say:

Security Forces stream ‘into the magnificent hall to meet him,
but lest we forget, Presten is a Grammaton Cleric. First

In a blaze of Fire, both guns bucking like pistons, he tolls
in blood the history of avery an who dares challenge him,
rolling like thunder down the mirrored corridor.

gUNS flowing with tha machine-like grace of a printing press,
a blur of Fire in hia hards, he fills the statistical
trajectories with blacing paths of lead.

Se accurate and so intuitive are they moth that’ every bullet
fired by one is parried - blasted gut of existence - by the
answering bullet of the other. -

Tn an instant, the air is thick with screaming shraonal as
their bullets explode together in & machine-gun staccato of
gtuttering collisions.

Meither man able to get toe edge over the other whose
