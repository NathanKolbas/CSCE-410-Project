KIN
BAGMAN
By

Daniel Casey

Based on the short film by
Jonathan & Josh Baker
OVER BLACK:

YOUNG VOICE (V.O.)

You don't get to choose family.
(beat)

You don’t. And just cause someone's

family, it doesn’t mean they can’t

hurt you. Doesn’t mean they won't.

EXT. DETROIT CITYSCAPE - DAY

ANGLE: straight down and moving. An infinite patchwork of
blasted cityscape in cubes and rectangles.

YOUNG VOICE (V.O.)

All you can do when it comes to the

people you love is brace yourself.
(beat)

That's just how it is.

The tops of buildings from way far up. Rolling out before us
like a gargantuan concrete blanket spattered in greenery.

INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - UNSPEC - DAY

 

ANGLE: we come in on a set of youthful shoulders. A KID,
seated, facing away from us. Beyond, behind a desk, is an
AGING WOMAN, dressed in conservative attire.

This boy is ELI (12), black, handsome. Quiet.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
How would you say the year has
been, overall?

Still facing away from us, Eli shrugs.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
Good? Bad?

ELI
Normal. I think.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
Normal for you, or for a regular
school year?

ELI
For a school year.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
How was your year?
Eli is quiet for a moment. Doesn’t answer that question. And
as he holds this silence -- we BEGIN TO TRACK around him --

ELI
Fine.

The Guidance Counselor doesn’t push any harder on this.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
And things at home? How’s your dad?
How’s he doing?

Another shrug.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
What about plans for the summer,
any vacations in the works?

Eli shakes his head. And now we’ve gotten our first good look
at him. Handsome for sure. Wise-beyond-his-years...

... the Guidance Counselor takes in his face and smiles,
pleasant. But there’s something preoccupied lingering.

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
It’s okay to talk to me, Elijah.
(beat)
It is. Sitting across from me I see a
young man who’s creative, and smart --
(then)
-- but who doesn’t want to be seen.

The Guidance Counselor waits another beat for Eli to take
this in. When he stays quiet, she lets him go --

GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
Be good out there. We’ll see you in
September.

ELI
Okay.

And over this -- we HEAR THE SOUND OF A SCHOOL BELL -- the
FERVOR of EXCITED STUDENT VOICES transitioning us into --

EXT. ST. FLORIAN’S - PARKING LOT - DAY

 

ON ELI as he moves. Apart from his CLASSMATES, celebrating
and WHOOPING as the school year ends --

SOME race for BASKETBALL COURTS, GIRLS Eli’s age flutter in
and out of GOSSIPY CIRCLES, OTHER KIDS opt for TRICKS on
SKATEBOARDS -- CUTTING past Eli -- who moves on his own.
Wading through all this. We see it clear as day. Eli doesn’t
gel with his peers. He’s not one of them. Setting out instead
for the neighborhoods beyond. Determined.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

A rusty garage door is YANKED open. Eli, with a backpack over
his shoulder, enters and crosses for --

-- a weathered BMX bike.

EXT. HAMTRAMCK - CITY STREETS - DAY

 

PEDALING. Sunshine. Wanderlust. Spokes WHIP past, as does a --
-- hodge-podge of low-rent signage in this heart of DETROIT's

former industrial corridor. Polish, Bangladeshi, Arabic and
more. Eli WEAVES westward up Caniff -- skids to a STOP at --

EXT. PRELLA METALWORKS - SCRAPYARD - CONTINUOUS

 

HASAN, a tattooed Arabic teen with a cigarette lit, sees Eli
coming, sweeping out front --

HASAN
You got another haul for us or what?

ELI
Almost there. What’s copper at?

HASAN
Copper and aluminum radiators.
Seventy cents a pound this week.

ELI
(re: up the street)
L & J says they’1l do 80.

Hasan looks at Eli. Beat. Then drags and smiles.

HASAN
That's what they said?
(Eli nods)
I'll talk to my uncle. Bring what
you got here first, okay?
(in Arabic)
Little thief.
EXT. HIGHLAND PARK - DETROIT - DAY

Eli makes his way across the 1-75 OVERPASS now. Into wide
swaths of DERELICT CITY which follow. Open expanses of VACANT
LOTS, ABANDONED HOMES and FACTORIES. Remnants of a different
era. Epic. Dystopic. Eli a SPECK in this wild.

EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - DAY

Interconnected shells of buildings TOWER past barb-wire gates.
Abandoned. Busted glass, scorched pavement and litter.

Eli SWOOPS PAST into view, stashes his bike near an overpass,
peels back a section of perimeter fencing --

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

 

Almost cathedral-like. Eli enters. Ahead, a wide section of
the roof has collapsed under decades of heavy snow.

Vines and greenery swallow fossilized machinery guts now in
the hot and humid months. Dancing across ruin.

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - SECOND BUILDING - DAY

 

ECHOES. Eli uses a CROWBAR from his bag to CHIP away at
walls. He slows -- peers into the hole he’s just burrowed.

He knew it. Begins TUGGING out dirty COPPER WIRE. Begins
excavating ALUMINUM PIPING next. Piece by piece. An expert.

ANGLES: stuffing his backpack. Searching. Hacking. REPEATING
the process. AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN. His haul growing...

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - THIRD BUILDING - DAY

 

SHIMMYING beneath a half-collapsed door. Further inside now.
Eli sets his nearly-full backpack down for a beat --

-- and reaches into his pocket to grab an INHALER. A PUFFER
we recognize as the type carried for asthma. Eli uses it.

Takes a deep BREATH reaches for his CROWBAR --
Then stops. Beat. His breath is visible. It's cold in here.

Eli turns. Spots a DARKENED CORRIDOR ahead. A small frozen
wind brushes past. Eli removes a MAGLIGHT from his backpack.
INT. DARKENED CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

 

MOVING through total blackness. Eli clicks on the flashlight
as -- KKAA-RRUUNG. A NOISE faraway -- dust shakes loose above.

-- Eli LOOKS. Listens a beat. Nothing follows.

His breath FOGGING the air thicker. It’s summer outside. It
should be an oven in here.

Eli shines his light -- crystalline formations of ice are

visible along the floor at his feet and along walls. He moves
around a final bend, frost crunching underfoot, into --

INT. MASSIVE FROZEN CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

 

A MASSIVE DERELICT CHAMBER. Enters. Cautious --

Eli sees something that takes him -- and us -- a moment to
process. This cavernous space like all the others except:

Whispers of light snow levitate past --

Adding an ethereal aura to what looks like DAMAGE done by
some kind of WEAPONS FIRE. Slits of natural light cut through
BLAST HOLES EVERYWHERE.

Not done by bullets. Something else.

Eli, heart beginning to thunder -- steps forward. And sees --

BODIES. A half-odd dozen of them or more --

All in ADVANCED, MENACING, OTHERWORLDLY ARMOR -- lying strewn
about the space in varying configurations of carnage.

Eli has somehow wandered into the aftermath of an O.K. Corral
scenario. Only we can’t be sure the players are from Earth.

HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.

This was an ugly fight too. Eli turns. Half expecting sirens
or some adult to burst into the room and take charge...

Only silence and frozen wind call back. Eli hesitates. Wades
even closer...

..-- from the look of these ARMORED BODIES, there were TWO
DISTINCT SIDES. ONE has sleeker-looking ARMOR, the SECOND is
rough-etched. Utilitarian beneath bits of battered garb.

Both sides WEAR MECHANIZED HELMETS. Concealing their features.
Eli sloooowly approaches the closest MOTIONLESS BODY, splayed
out across a pile of RUBBLE -- he stares at the helmet and
carefully wipes away a thin layer of frost from the visor --

-- and slows. At Eli’s feet: IS SOME KIND OF METALLIC DEVICE.

One of theirs. Its contours sleek and other-worldly. Eli
leans down... grips it. Cautious. Lifts it to INSPECT --

-- and the gesture ACTIVATES something. The device CHIMES.
Some kind of PROMPT, as though it’s POWERING UP. As it does --

-- the device OPENS. Or rather, the OUTER LAYER DOES. A self-
retracting SHIELD. Revealing the CONTOURS of what’s clearly a
SHOTGUN-SIZED ALIEN WEAPON beneath --

-- then the MOTIONLESS BODY he was just examining MOVES. Its
helmet turns, looks right at Eli --

-- and the ARMORED FIGURE THRUSTS A DYING HAND TOWARDS ELI.
Eli RECOILS. SLIPS on ice. FALLS. DROPS everything --

MAGLIGHT gone. THE WEAPON-SHAPED DEVICE TOO. It goes SLIDING
away from Eli and -- DOWN INTO an open ELEVATOR SHAFT --

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - THIRD BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

 

Eli SCRAMBLES. Slip-sliding. FUMBLES for his BACKPACK.

EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - DARKENED CORRIDOR - DAY

 

PIECES of piping clang and roll down the street as Eli PEDALS
away. Backpack not zipped up. RACING like FUCKING HELL --

PANTING. HYPERVENTILATING. PANIC. EYES WIDE -- only once he's
cleared a good few blocks does Eli skid to a stop --

GASPING. Sheer. Utter. Absolute. Disbelief. He reaches once
more for his INHALER, and as he does, USES it -- BREATHES --

Staring back at the ABANDONED COMPLEX -- we CUT TO:

B AG M A N

EXT. HAMTRAMCK - CITY STREETS - LATE DAY

 

Eli pedals, ghostly pale, scanning every passing face. Folks
concerned with daily commutes, deliveries -- the mundane...
EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DAY

Eli ushers his BMX up the drive of a tiny, sturdy home. Built
originally for auto-workers in the 1920s. Stashes his bike.

EXT. BACK OF THE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

 

And moves for the back of the garage to an overturned WHEEL-
BARROW. Lifts it to reveal a BOX FILLED with SCRAP metal. Eli
deposits what’s left in his backpack and --

INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

 

Eli. Quiet. Motionless. Mind still churning. Replaying events
in his head atop a sofa in this working man's living room.

HEADLIGHTS of an early nineties PICKUP TRUCK pull into the
driveway outside. Booted FOOTSTEPS approach --

HAROLD HROBSKY, or HAL (late 50s), white, enters. A battered
old Polack. Face and hands like granite. Hard lines. Wearing
a well-used Red Wings jacket.

HAL
Finish your homework?

ELI
Summer break started.

HAL
(recollects, looks around)
And now you've, what? Forgotten how
to read?

Hal points to a NOTE. Hand-scrawled in bossy all-caps: DO
YOUR CHORES!

HAL
Get your shoes on, I need help with
something.

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DRIVEWAY/GARAGE - DUSK

Eli straining, helping Hal move a shitload of cut lumber from
his truck to the garage in the dark. This sucks.

HAL
-- that rush gig in Corktown. They
change their minds every day last
minute, had to -- pick all this up
for tomorrow --
They set down the last piece. Eli realizes --

ELI
We gotta load all this back in?

HAL
At six thirty a.m. That is correct.
(off Eli’s look)
Somebody’'11 steal it.

Hal passes en route for the garage. Eli silently protesting --

ELI
Who’s gonna steal a buncha wood?

HAL
(sends him a look)
You seen my maglight?

That would be the flashlight Eli abandoned earlier. Oops.

ELI
Not lately...

Hal CURSES in Polish, scans the place one more time in vein
and crosses back to the truck for invoice slips.

Sits on the lift-gate. Squints and scribbles. Eli quiet.
Clearly annoyed and looking to slip back inside --

HAL
What’s with you today? Huh? You
forget your chores, I can see you
giving me lip --

Hal looks at Eli. Regards him. Motions him over.

HAL

You know if I’m hard on you, it's
cause the world’s hard. I’ve seen
that.

(beat)
And a good man? Accounts for himself.
He shoulders responsibility, even
when he doesn’t want to.

Eli nods, but it’s to get Hal off his back. Hal holds on that
a moment. Shifts. Preoccupied with something unsaid...

HAL
We need a third place for dinner.
(beat)
Your brother's on his way.
Hal HOLDS on Eli. Says this next part with significance.

HAL
Be careful around him.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - VARIOUS - NIGHT

 

Sizzling frying pans and simmering pots fog the air as Hal
COOKS. Eli removes a new plate and utensils from a cupboard --

The DOORBELL RINGS. Eli turns to Hal, who nods. Get it. Eli
goes. Opens the front door to get our first look at --

JIMMY HROBSKY (20s), white, handsome with a dash of scumbag.
Stands on the stoop, lean, tattooed and cool with a bag slung
over his shoulder.

Jimmy bears a familial resemblance to Hal -- genetic only.
JIMMY
Eli.
ELI
Hey.
JIMMY

Man. Six years didn’t seem like
such a long time until just now --

Jimmy brushes past. Rustles Eli’s hair as he goes -- Eli
wincing. Jimmy enters the living room, looks around as though
sizing it up, and slows. Then.

Jimmy sees, crosses toward Hal in the kitchen.

JIMMY
Pops.

Hal looks up, eyes his son standing in the doorway. Wary --

JIMMY
This is just for a week or two.

HAL
I know.

An unspoken sentiment hangs thick between these two. Hal
cautiously nods.

HAL
Eli can set you up in the office.
10.

JIMMY
Office?

HAL
Upstairs.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
ANGLE: a completely empty bedroom with a desk in it. Barren.

Jimmy shakes his head. Tosses his bag onto a dusty futon and
turns to Eli. Looks him over.

JIMMY
So. What's your deal these days?

Eli shrugs. Beat. Jimmy does the gesture right back.

JIMMY
That? That’s your deal? You
remember me at all?

ELI
A little.

JIMMY
How old were you when I left?

ELI
Which time?

Jimmy snickers. Looks Eli over and grins. A mischievous glint
flashing. Jimmy then pushes past Eli into --

JIMMY
Let’s see what you did, huh? To my
digs.

ELI'S ROOM. Enters without permission. Jimmy scans walls of
space charts, original artwork and drawings, sketches of
other planets and maps... huh...

JIMMY
Wow, okay...

.-». he turns to Eli’s CLOSET. Eli watches, cautious, as Jimmy

spots a set of NOTCHES. HEIGHT MARKS with corresponding DATES
scribbled to measure the growth of a child. Written atop is:

ELI.

Jimmy turns to a second set of NOTCHES on the opposite frame.
11.

JIMMY. He regards them a moment, looks down -- then --

JIMMY
What the hell are those?

He’s pointing at Eli's sneakers on the floor.

ELI
My shoes.

JIMMY
You wear those in public?

ELI
I’m saving up for new ones.

JIMMY
With what? Dad’s five-dollar-a-week-
allowance?

Jimmy slows. Notes the way Eli stays quiet --

JIMMY
Oh. You got a side thing going.
Little lemonade stand?
(then)
Good for you. I can respect that.

Jimmy throws an honor-among-thieves smile at Eli.

Eli nods.

JIMMY
Tell you what. I got some Chucks
somewhere around here in a trunk.
You can have em. They’re almost new.
Won't stink as much as those do.
(then)
Sound good?

There’s an outlaw charm to Jimmy.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmy, cleaned up -- takes in the space of the living room.
Catholic and Polish decor. Sayings in the latter.

Jimmy turns, eyes a full roster of RED WINGS BOBBLE HEADS on
a dusty shelf. Narrows in on an YZERMAN and BOB PROBERT.

Hal crosses out of the kitchen nearby. Bringing SERVING
DISHES to the table. Corn, baked potatoes and Golabki --
Hal looks

Hal turns
the shelf
a YOUNGER

12.

JIMMY
(points)
Still got the bobble-heads, huh?

up, regards the shelf a moment...

HAL
Your mother liked em. So.

back into the kitchen. Leaving Jimmy to consider
a moment longer. Just past them -- is a PICTURE of
HAL with his arms around JIMMY’S MOTHER.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

 

Eating in silence. Routine for Hal and Eli, but -- Jimmy sips
from his bowl -- slows -- revels in the moment.
JIMMY

Golabki. You guys got no idea, man.
None. Don't even get me started.

(to Eli)
Think you could ever miss the taste
of a baked potato? And I mean. Not
special. Just made right, like this,
with a little butter.

(then)
You get locked away you got no idea
the kinda shit you’1ll miss. If
somebody gave me a blue light right
now and some ice cream, there'd be a
high probability of me breaking into
tears like a little bit-

Jimmy sees Hal’s expression and stops just shy. Eli grins.

Hal nods,

HAL
Glad you like.

JIMMY
I do. So, uh. How's business?

HAL
Fine.

sips. Jimmy waits for him to elaborate.

Doesn't happen. So Jimmy nods. Chews.

Looks to Eli. Who’s watching both of them, eating. Beat.
JIMMY
You talk too much. Anyone ever tell
you that? Huh?

Eli grins again. Hal watches the way Eli sparks to that --

HAL
-- those are new. On your hands.

Hal motions. Stern. To a pair of Jimmy’s small prison tats.

JIMMY
Yeah? Like em?
(taps each)
This one wards off evil spirits,
and this one wards off Mexicans.

Eli abruptly SNORTS into his stew.

HAL

You think that’s funny?
JIMMY

Eli does.
HAL

He’s twelve.
Hal turns his gaze on Eli. Face buried in his meal.

JIMMY
Sorry. It’s not. Look --
(exhales )
I'm happy to be home, okay? I just
wanna talk and laugh and catch up
like a family. I don’t mean anyt-

HAL

This isn't a reunion.
JIMMY

I know --
HAL

You were just released. You’re here
cause you gotta sort your life out.

JIMMY
And I’m gonna --

HAL
So you wanna talk, let's talk about
that. What’re your next steps?
14.

JIMMY
I'll get a job.

HAL
Where? What kinda job?

Jimmy wavers. On the spot. Eli looks from Hal to Jimmy, then
back to Hal...

JIMMY

To be honest? I was thinking that,
with coming back, putting in some
time for --

(here goes)
Us to bond, show you I'm straight --
Maybe you could put in a good word
at whatever site you're working.

HAL
I can’t do that.
JIMMY
Why not?
HAL

Cause I can't clear an ex-con. It
doesn’t work like that.

JIMMY
But I'm your son -- I mean, you
just tell em --

Hal sends a look at Jimmy. This isn’t gonna be discussed.

Jimmy wavers. Hal stares right back. Beat. So Jimmy grabs his
fork. Fishing through his meal. STABBING carrots --

JIMMY
Great. So. Six years gone, no word,
no visit --

HAL
I visited.

JIMMY
Once. To let me know ma passed. Six
years! I come home, no complaints,
ask for one favor and it turns out
you'd rather see me flipping
burgers --

HAL
It’s a start.
15.

JIMMY
Flipping burgers?!

HAL
Anything's better than being a
thief. A low life.

Jimmy halts. That stung. Looks at Hal, staring back.

JIMMY
I think I'm gonna step out. Got a
few people to see.

Jimmy slides his chair back LOUD, brings his plate to the
sink. Grabs his coat, a spare key, and he's gone. Eli, head
still low, waits a moment... looks to Hal...

HAL

(growls)
Chores. Then bed.

EXT. TATTERED HOUSE - WESTLAND - NIGHT

 

WESTLAND. Just shy of Canton. Called wasteland by locals for
a reason. A downriver sprawl transformed by River Rouge plant
runoff into a hick meth paradise. A CAB pulls past us --

Jimmy gets out -- crosses the street. A group of TEENAGERS
across the street is going at it -- a BRAWL on a LAWN --

Two dead-eyed CONS lean off a stoop ahead. Tattoos depicting
valknots and the numbers 14 and 88. The SCARIER one eyes
Jimmy’s approach --

SCARY
What you looking for, man?

JIMMY
Just finished a bid out in Jackson.
Uh. Taylor's expecting me to come
through... he here?

INT. TATTERED HOUSE - WESTLAND - NIGHT

 

A SHIT HOLE topped off with a brand new PS4 and FLAT-SCREEN.
Cigarette-burned furniture everywhere. JUNKIES loiter like
zombies. Filthy. Swimming in drug paraphernalia. Cheery MUSIC
plays loudly.

Jimmy's led by a YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN. Either sleep-deprived or
high -- through a gross KITCHEN, passing YOUNG TEENS counting
CASH out on a folding table. To a STAIRWELL --
16.

INT. TATTERED HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Jimmy, doing his best calm walk, descends into an unfinished
cement dungeon. Oddly packed with SHIPPING CRATES and --

-- prying each one open with a crowbar is TAYLOR BOLEK (30s).
a grimy Aryan con with a leaning gate and cleft lip.

TAYLOR
(smiles)
Hrobsky! Welcome home, man -- you

remember my brother Dutch?

Jimmy nods to DUTCH (30s), seated atop a crate nearby -- the
bigger, Cro-Magnon version of Taylor. Staring murder.

JIMMY
Yeah. How’s it goin, I uh --

Jimmy's spotted this basement's THIRD OCCUPANT. A SHIRTLESS
GUY, beat to shit -- FACING the corner, bleeding from his
ear.

TAYLOR
Oh that’s Renny. Don't worry about
him, he's in time-out.

The guy wobbles. The recipient of a very recent beating --

RENNY
Tay man, come on --

TAYLOR
Hey! What'd I tell you??

RENNY
-- my ear's bleeding, man...

TAYLOR
PUT YOUR NOSE back in that corner
right fuckin now, you hear me??
Contemplate your shitty attitude.

Jimmy watches this exchange -- looks again to DUTCH -- who’s
GLARING at Jimmy. Taylor turns back to the shipping crate --

TAYLOR
So Jimmy. You wanna toast a spliff
or get right to it?

Taylor RIPS the top of the crate off -- pulls a MACHINE GUN
out into open view. This crate is FULL of them. Isreali-made.

Jimmy chokes out a tense smile --
17.

JIMMY
Not quite time to toast yet for me -
- I know, I uh. I owe you guys
money, which -- I'm taking real
serious...

The temperature of the room seems to drop a few degrees.

TAYLOR
So you don’t got the sixty?
JIMMY
No, but -- I want you to see, I’m

not dodging you guys --

TAYLOR
Man. That's a real bummer.

Taylor begins loading machine guns into smaller boxes labeled
SALSA -- where Dutch looks ready to take Jimmy’s head off.

TAYLOR

See, Jimmy -- me and my brother --

(lots and lots of guns)
We don’t, ah. Project illusions
about who we are and what we do,
you know? We made it clear from day
one, post charges or what have you,
how we operate on loans, cause
there are guys who do business like
you, and guys who do business like
us --

(turns )
Jail can be a nasty place. You
needed protection out in Jackson
and we were there for you.

Taylor slows. Takes a mag. Fishes for a box of rounds, starts
loading it. Smiling away.

TAYLOR
There some funny language about
that you didn't understand? Some
kinda fine print problem?

CLICK-CLACK. The MACHINE GUN in Taylor's hands is loaded now.
He takes a step in toward Jimmy --

JIMMY
N. No man -- that, that’s --

TAYLOR
We know you got that father, a
colored little brother...
18.

TAYLOR (CONT'D)
(postures )
We could go collect from them?

Jimmy's scrambling. FAST for a lifeboat here and --
JIMMY
-- Taylor. Man.
(-- folds)
I said I didn't have it here -- not
that I don't have it.

Taylor holds. Stays put. Right in Jimmy’s face. Smiling...

INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT - DREAM - UNSPEC

 

We're in what we can best make out at first as a dark space.
LIGHTS, unearthly, glow in abstract -- HUMMING. Brighter.
This glow gathers, PULSING upward along CONCRETE WALLS --
INT. ELI'S ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE: Eli wakes up. Lying in bed. The HUMMING still ringing
lightly in his ears...

After a moment -- he sits up, unable to shake the dream...

EXT. DETROIT - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

 

Eli PEDALS. A DUFFLE BAG slung over his shoulders. ADRENALINE
spiking. A kid who shouldn’t be out in a neighborhood this
tough this late. Scary --

A TRIO of HOODS CALL OUT from a GAS STATION as he passes,
faces lit only by the cherries of dragged cigarettes --

HOODS, ETC
Yo -- 1il man! Hey! Come here real
quick -- Yo!

EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - NIGHT

 

Eli skids to a stop. No one’s visible in sight. Street lights
don't work out here. VACANT STRUCTURES linger now like creaky
monsters dozing in hunkered down silence. Haunting.

The MASSIVE ABANDONED COMPLEX is right where we left it.
19.

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - MINUTES LATER

 

Eli enters. Moving through the MASSIVE SPACE. Every step an ECHO
in the black. Eli wades further --

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - O.K. CORRAL - NIGHT

 

ANGLE: HAL'S MAGLIGHT. Right where it was dropped. Eli picks
it up. CLICKS it on and TURNS, SCANS the open air and --

The aftermath of what we witnessed earlier is 100% GONE.

No ice formations. No strange, FALLEN ARMORED ALIEN SOLDIERS.
Like no one was ever here. Eli WHIRLS. Aims his flashlight at
the walls, the ceiling, the floor -- SCORCH MARKS and HOLES
left by the WEAPONS’ FIRE remain, but if we're being honest --
A naysayer could call those anything.

Eli turns to THE OPEN ELEVATOR SHAFT. Where THE WEAPON went
SLIDING... he crosses -- leans over the edge --

Three stories straight down into shadow. Eli wavers... GRIPS
his DUFFLE. CLIMBS down and in. SCALING.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

 

Eli DROPS to a safe landing, into decades of dust and debris.

Pitch black. Eli fumbles. CLICKS on the MAGLIGHT. Lighting up
the bottom of this space around him --

SEES THE WEAPON DEVICE. Still down here. Lying in the dirt.

Eli reaches for it -- but before he can touch it, LIGHTS
illuminate across the DEVICE. Eli recoils, startled for a
second, then -- slowly -- he reaches... picks it up.

Once again, it CHIMES. As though this thing has recognized
him -- THE WEAPON COMES TO LIFE.

Lighting up the darkness down here with an OTHERWORLDLY GLOW.
THE OUTER SHIELD OPENS.

RECONFIGURING. PIECES of its EXTERIOR RETRACT AND FOLD BACK
on their own to REVEAL a TRIGGER, BARREL -- a 3D TARGETTING
system flickers into view, glowing, summoned out of thin air.

Impossibly cool. The weapon HUMMING. Talking to him. Eli
takes in the sight of what’s now held in his hands...
20.
EXT. CITY STREETS - MOVING - NIGHT
ANGLE: that DUFFLE BAG NOW FULL. Slung over Eli's shoulders

as he PEDALS. THE WEAPON inside.

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - UP THE BLOCK - NIGHT

 

Eli comes RACING up the street. SWERVES for cover behind
bushes as -- a CAB pulls up to Hal's house ahead --

Jimmy. Eli watches Jimmy get out, his footsteps a tipsy
march. Climbing the front stairs of the house...

INT. HROBSKY HOME - NIGHT

Jimmy enters. Sees HAL. Still up watching Red Wings
highlights. Beat.

HAL
Where'd you go?

JIMMY
Ended up at the Polish Sea League,
um. Knew the bartender from ham
high, she --
(drunk, smiles)
Bought me some celebratory shots.

Another beat. Jimmy's fumbling a little with the sleeves of
his coat. Hal, watches this -- and --

HAL
You need anything?

Jimmy slows. Hal’s looked up from the TV at him. Jimmy’s
unprepared for the civility. Cautious.

JIMMY
Erm. Water? Tylenol?

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - CONTINUOUS

THE FOLLOWING IS ALL ONE SHOT: Eli silently walks his bike up
the driveway, DUCKS as Hal crosses past in the window above --

-- holds. Eli stashes the bike and crosses, climbs a nearby
garden stoop. Up along the back of the house. Up. Up. Up. Eli
reaches, grips the gutter above --

AND FREEZES. As Hal re-emerges in view. Slows to a STOP in
the window above the sink. Goes. Once he’s gone, Eli looks --
21.

Scales the rest of the way up to his bedroom window --

INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hal returns to Jimmy with the glass of water, offers it along
with two tablets of store brand ibuprofen. Jimmy accepts...

JIMMY
Gonna need, uh --

He fumbles. Smiles again. Stuffs the pills into his pocket.

JIMMY
-- these bad boys in the morning.

And Hal watches his own son. Drunk. Making hangover jokes...
something stirs deep down. Just trying to put it right.

HAL

Jimmy. I wanna help you, okay? I
do. But you got a decade’s worth of
bad decisions under your belt, and
you gotta make up for that first.
You gotta be ready to work jobs you
don’t like, earn experience, earn
trust --

Jimmy nods. Bleary. Pounding the glass of water. Hal eyes
this -- maybe now’s not the time.

HAL
But, uh. Let’s talk in the morning.

Hal nods, moves for the stairs. And as he goes --

JIMMY
No. We should talk now.

Hal slows. Something was different in Jimmy's voice right
there -- he turns back...

INT. ELI'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eli slides the DUFFLE BAG with THE WEAPON under his bed --
rises. Hearing VOICES in the living room below...

INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy thumbs that empty water glass a moment -- shaky... and

he looks back at Hal. For the first time in a while. Jimmy’s
eyes are glassy. With more than booze.
22.

JIMMY
Sixty K. I need to borrow sixty K.
Sorry but it’s gotta be you.

Jimmy's eyes are glassy with fear. Hal’s unsure how to react.

HAL
From me? Are you kidding? Jimmy I
don’t have that kind of --

JIMMY
It’s a whole thing. It's the reason
I'm alive right now. You gotta hear
me out —-

HAL
-- no. I don't.

Hal’s interrupted Jimmy. He holds on his son.

HAL
Not in my own home. Whatever this
is, I’m not interested. Not anymore.

Hal turns again. Moves determined up the stairs now --

JIMMY
What about the safe?
(beat)
The one you keep at work sites.

-- and Hal STOPS.

JIMMY
One time, cash goes missing. I'll
never ask you for a thing again, I
can even pay it back over time --

Hal MOVES decisively back down the stairs --

HAL
What exactly are you saying to me?
You want me to do what, exactly?
(approaching)
Steal for you? Let you steal?

JIMMY
It’s not for me, that’s what I’m-

HAL
Who's it for then? Huh? Let’s hear.
Go ahead --
23.

JIMMY

Dangerous people. Okay? For when I
was inside.

(imploring)
The kind you don't not pay back.
People who won't just stop with me,
you -- you --

(dire)
Understand what I'm saying to you?
I’m trying to protect you guys here!

UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Eli, now back in his pajamas, quietly
approaches the top of the STAIRCASE -- there’s silence, then:

HAL (0.S.)
Get the hell out. Now.

DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Hal’s anger now barely controlled --
jabs his finger at the door. Jimmy, plea still ringing in his
eyes, examines this -- and turns. Sets down the water glass --

JIMMY
It’s funny. Cause I came in here --
marvelling at this place like the
house time forgot, but you made
changes, didn’t you?

He grabs his jacket, moves for the door and slows. Motions.

JIMMY
(fumbles with his coat)
I don’t see myself in any a these
pictures -- not a one. My room?
It’s gone. You’ve got your
replacement son up there in my bed.

UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Eli, hearing Jimmy refer to him like
this, blinks -- and pauses. Those words hurt.

JIMMY (0.S.)
You erased every trace’a me. Didn't
you? That how proud I make you?
Would Mom’ve wanted that?

HAL (0.S.)
Your mother’d be disgusted right
now. Get the fuck outta my house.
I’m not telling you again.

DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS: Jimmy nods. Some father. SLAMS the
door as he GOES. Leaves Hal to watch him trail away alone...

We HOLD on Hal here. His face. All of this familiar.
24.

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - PRE-DAWN

Eli STRAINS again. Loading lumber back into Hal's truck. Hal
slams a piece into place. Visibly grumpier than usual.

Hal hands Eli a piece of paper en route to closing up the
garage. SLAMMING it shut.

HAL
Here. Things I need done today.
Before I get home.
Eli looks. It's a LIST of chores like a million miles long.

ELI
Today? Ever since Jimmy --

HAL
-- Jimmy's got nothing to do with
it. I'm keeping you out of trouble.
Hal climbs into his truck without another word, starts up and
pulls away. Eli watches him go a moment. What the hell?

INT. HROBSKY HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - BEDROOM - MORNING

 

IN THE HALLWAY: We HEAR THE WEAPON power to life behind Eli’s
closed bedroom door. PULSATING.

ANGLE: ELI in his room. Holding it up now. Its SIGHTING
SYSTEM flickers into view. He grins, inspecting its contours
up close...

And moves to a STANDING MIRROR ahead. MUGS at his reflection
with THE WEAPON. MASSIVE in his hands. Eli poses with it a
few times -- and grins. Begins QUICK-DRAWING with the SPACE
WEAPON on his own reflection. SHWIP! SWHIP! SHWIP!

He stops. Beat. Listening for the sound of Hal’s truck, and --

ELI
What’d you say?
(DRAWS REAL FAST)
Want summa this, huh?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

One of those dumps along 8 mile near Woodward. Jimmy, hungover
at the edge of a shoddy bed -- eyes the ibuprofin Hal gave
him. Looking like death. Searching the air for options.
25.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

 

The place is spotless. Eli’s watching TV when Hal ENTERS --

CROSSES and DROPS an arm-load of SCRAP METAL onto the CARPET.
Eli JOLTS --

HAL
My maglight mysteriously reappears
right where it's supposed to be --
and I'm not gonna get curious? Took
me all of five seconds to find that
stash behind the garage. Explain.

Eli’s trapped. Locks up -- debates denying it until he sees
the look on Hal’s face -- thinks better of it.
ELI

... there’s a couple scrap yards
that pay money for --

HAL
-- scrapping? You're scrapping?
Where did all this come from?

ELI
A place off Grand River.

HAL
Did this place, like my lot, have a
fence around it that said stay out?

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - DUSK

Eli STOMPS down the stairs of the front stoop behind Hal.
Both of them headed for Hal's truck --

HAL
I've got a directory of property
developers at the site. You're
gonna call every single one you've
broken into, tell them what you did
and pray to God they accept your
apology --

And Eli STOPS. In disbelief of how bad Hal is freaking out --

ELI
WHY? It’s just a bunch of old metal --

HAL
-- that wasn’t yours, Elijah! None
of it.
26.

HAL (CONT'D)
Now get in the truck, or do I call
the police instead? Your decision.

EXT/INT. HAL'S TRUCK - WOODWARD AVE - NIGHT

Hal and Eli ride. Eli not speaking. Angry, humiliated. After
a moment, he GRUMBLES something as we JOSTLE with potholes...

HAL
What'd you say?

Eli doesn’t respond.

HAL
I catch you stealing but I’m the
bad guy? That’s it?

ELI
I didn't hurt anybody -- it’s stuff
that’s been sitting there for years --

HAL
Everything that’s ever been stolen
ever was something that was just
sitting there.

ELI
I don’t even know why I listen to
you.

HAL
You don’t have a choice, I’m your
father --

ELI

No you’re not. Only reason I’m here
is cause you guys wanted some kinda
replacement kid --

Hal looks at Eli. HOLDS. Driving. Throws on his blinker.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - NIGHT

The epicenter of Detroit’s more recent gentrification. Hal
pulls up to a CONSTRUCTION SITE. A condo high-rise for rich
kids moving in from the burbs. His TRUCK rumbles to a stop --

HAL
Where’d you hear that? Someone tell
you that?

Eli doesn’t answer.
27.

Hal puts it in park. Collects himself.

HAL
I’m gonna say this to you once, and I
want you to hear me. You are nobody's
replacement.

Hal goes quiet a moment. Chooses his words carefully, but
with conviction.

HAL

You're not somebody’s guilt trip.
You're not some booby-prize.

(then)
You’re our son. But your mother’s
gone now, so it’s my job to pull you
as far back from the ledge’a bad
decisions as possible -- and I’m
doing the best I can without her.
This may not always make us best
buddies, but hopefully it’1l mean
the difference between you turning

out okay -- and you not. That’s why
we're here. That’s why I’m hard on
you.
Beat. Eli softens -- but only a little. Hal holds on him.

Silence passes. Eli’s unmoving. Hal shakes his head. EXHALES.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - CONTINUOUS

 

Hal and Eli get out, crossing up the street towards a sign
labeled SOUTH ENTRANCE. Hal pulls out HIS KEYS --

-- and sees the CHAIN around the GATE has been CUT. The
PADLOCK dangles imperceptibly off to the side.

Hal slows. Grave. Intercepts Eli, directs him back to the
truck. Hands him the keys.

HAL

Wait in the truck a minute.
ELI

Why?
HAL

Go. I‘’1l be back.

Eli TSKS, complies. Hal closes the door behind him, reaches
for a crowbar in the truck’s bed, heads for the GATE.
28.

INT. HAL'S TRUCK - CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

 

Eli, alone now, locks the doors and begins FLIPPING through
HIP HOP stations -- the street beyond quiet --
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS

Hal moves cautiously. Towering steel columns lift up and away
into darkness. He rounds a bend to see HIS WORK TRAILER.

The LIGHT is ON inside. Music can be heard. An ANCIENT RADIO
scratching out Joni Mitchell’s copacetic hymnal: HELP ME.

Hal moves for this, fast and --

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MANAGER'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

 

-- opens the trailer door. It SWINGS open and Hal lays eyes
on JIMMY and the SIX-ODD SHADY CRIMINALS in here with him.

A SAFE behind Hal’s desk has been BROKEN OPEN. The last of
the CASH that was in his safe is being stuffed into a BLACK
GARBAGE BAG --

JIMMY
Dad -- what the FUCK --

Beat. Hal grips the crowbar TIGHT at his side -- Taylor,
who’s taken Hal’s seat behind his desk, rises --

TAYLOR
This is dad? Hey dad.

HAL
(to Jimmy only)
What are you doing in here?

TAYLOR
Taking money from this safe.

HAL
(points the crowbar)
That's not yours.

JIMMY
Dad I'm serious -- turn around and
walk the fuck outta here NOW --
we'll talk about this later.

Hal’s not gonna do that. He zeroes in on Taylor. Nods to the
black garbage bag --
29.

HAL
I don't know what my kid promised
you, but that’s not his to give or
yours to take.

TAYLOR
It isn’t?

JIMMY
Please -- Dad --

TAYLOR

Shh. Jimmy. Your father’s talking.

And Taylor's no longer smiling. Sizing Hal up. A distant
glaze settling over his expression.

TAYLOR

You were saying?
HAL

I don't have a gripe with you.
TAYLOR

But we gotta put this money back.

Hal swallows a lump in his throat -- squeezes the crowbar --

HAL

-- Yeah.
TAYLOR

Huh.

BLAM. Taylor DRAWS his weapon and FIRES on Hal. Blood
spatters. The round catches Hal in the chest --

JIMMY
NO --

Taylor’s AIMING again. All instinct, JIMMY RUSHES. DESPERATE.
GRABS for TAYLOR’S GUN as it FIRES. SENDS a ROUND through a
window -- and --

BLAM. Taylor SQUEEZES the trigger again as he and Jimmy
STRUGGLE. BLAM. A SHOT EXPLODES right through DUTCH'S NECK.
Dutch goes gurgling WIDE EYED BACKWARD. SCREAMS of shock.

EVERYONE DRAWS THEIR WEAPON.

So Jimmy BEGINS SQUEEZING the TRIGGER of Taylor's gun. BLAM.
Renny SHRIEKS. SHOT through the WRIST -- BLAM. RENNY SHOOTS
the GUY NEXT TO HIM through the foot who BLASTS the ceiling --
all of this a whirling berzerko nightmare --
30.
Jimmy trying to DRAIN the CLIP -- FIRING -- WRESTLES --
INT. HAL’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
As Eli sits in Hal’s truck, nodding along to BLASTING HIP HOP

-- we can see what he doesn’t: faint, distant MUZZLE FLASHES
in the FARAWAY darkness behind him --

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MANAGER'S TRAILER - CITY STREETS

 

Taylor manages to WRENCH Jimmy’s hand DOWNWARD, trying to
grab the gun and BLAM. A ROUND goes through Taylor’s LEG.

Taylor SCREAMS -- Joni Mitchell’s ballad CRESCENDOS --

CRACK! HEAD-BUTTS Jimmy. Sends him backward. Taylor collapses
as well, grabbing his THIGH and SCREAMING --

And he SEES -- DUTCH. GURGLING in the corner ahead with blood
bubbling out of the dime-sized HOLE in his neck --
TAYLOR
(scrambles for him)
N-nn-no -- nnn-no-no-no --
Panting, fumbling, Jimmy looks -- sees Hal. On the ground.
Eyes open, motionless for good. And the world quiets.
JIMMY
Dad? Dad --
Panic surges in Jimmy. The room drops into a spin. He JOLTS,
scrambles over to shake Hal -- water rising up -- denial --
JIMMY
DAD --

Nothing. Jimmy WHIRLS. Looking for help.

Nearby, Dutch is bleeding out. Taylor’s RIPPED a piece of his
shirt away to JAM it against his brother’s neck. PLEADING as
Dutch drowns in his own blood -- Taylor looks. Sees Jimmy.
Beat. Taylor fumbles for his GUN. Hands slick -- Jimmy
blanches, spots the BLACK PLASTIC BAG -- GRABS IT and LEAPS --

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MANAGER'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

 

Jimmy BITES IT into gravel outside as BULLETS SHATTER the
door frame behind him. CLAMORING. All sloppy foot-falls and
hand scrambles -- RACING away through the CONSTRUCTION SITE --
31.

INT. HAL'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

MUSIC PLAYS, drowning out the OUTSIDE -- Eli distracted --

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MANAGER'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

 

Dutch's eyes don’t close, but the last of his gurgling
dwindles into silence. Still, Taylor tries to stem the
bleeding -- holding -- mumbling --

TAYLOR
Dutch? Dutch?

Nothing. Taylor lets out a weird SOB -- brings his forehead
forward into Dutch's...

TAYLOR
Dutch, Dutch, Dutch, Dutchy...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - CONTINUOUS

 

Jimmy SKIDS through the entrance gate -- moves to tear across
the street and hop a fence -- when he --

Sees HAL'S TRUCK. Parked up the block. Eli. Inside.

FUCK. This can't be FUCKING HAPPENING --

Jimmy turns back to the CONSTRUCTION YARD. The sound of
FRANTIC VOICES can be heard. Taylor and his guys. They’re
coming this way. They’re gonna spot Eli and they'll --

Unspeakable scenarios spin through Jimmy’s head. He looks
once more to his path of escape -- he could go, but he --

Turns back. Heads for the truck. Frantic. Trying to force
back the overwhelming emotion drowning him --
INT. HAL'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Eli JOLTS as Jimmy APPEARS at the driver's side door. Pale.
But he sends Eli a big shakey smile. Eli unlocks the door.

Jimmy clamors in FAST --

JIMMY
Whattup kid, ahh...

Jimmy STARTS UP the truck without explanation, frantically
shifts into drive and PEELS OUT -- SPEEDING AWAY --
32.

ELI
W -- wait, what’re you doing?

Jimmy looks at Eli. Racing. Everything spinning. Stammers. No
clue what to say to this kid --

JIMMY
Ah. Didn’t -- I mean --

Jimmy looks at Eli. Floundering. White as a sheet. Stuttering.

JIMMY
Dad didn’t call you, ah. Too? To --
(searching)
To let you know about -- what
happened?
ELI

Dad won’t let me have a phone.

Jimmy proffers an oh yeah smile but he just looks weird.
GUNNING it away. LOOKS to the rear view --

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CORKTOWN - CONTINUOUS

Taylor STAGGERS through the gate just in time to see HAL'S
TRUCK speed away in the distance. His leg streaming blood,
bleary with rage.

Renny, his arm gushing blood as well, is STRUGGLING to keep
up, full blown panic --

RENNY
Tay, TAY man we gotta go! Cops’1l
be coming -- Tay -- we gotta get
outta here we GOTTA --

BLAM. Taylor SHOOTS Renny in the face. Reaches for his cell.
Dialing. Turns back into the site. Moving. Into the phone:

TAYLOR
Get the boys. Get the boys and get
the guns.

JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
There was a, ah -- a break in...
INT. HAL'S TRUCK - SPEEDING - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

His attempts to appear normal are getting a little better --
but still, Eli's not vibing with it --
33.

JIMMY
At the site, the south gate, right
there...
(thinking)
You didn’t see the chain cut?

ELI
No --

Jimmy's forming all of this in real time.

JIMMY
Somebody broke in -- stole a ton of
gear, two trucks. And. Just trashed
the place -- get this, they -- ah --
(got it!)
Dumped something like -- twenty
thousand cubic yards of concrete at
the base. Twenty thousand -- can

you believe that?
Jimmy TAKES a HARD TURN, still gunning it --

ELI
And he called you to pick me up?

Jimmy eyes Eli’s skepticism. Feigns indignance.

JIMMY
Of course he did, why wouldn’t he?

ELI
I heard you two arguing last night --

Jimmy keeps it up. Dodges.

JIMMY
Yeah. We got into it --
(looks at Eli)
-- how much did you hear?

ELI
I saw you leave.
JIMMY
We can argue, but -- does that mean

he can’t call me when an emergency
comes up? We’re family, we can set
little stuff aside when there’s an
emergency. I mean -- right?

Eli shrugs. Looks Jimmy over...
34.

ELI
Why are you all sweaty?

Jimmy stalls a second --

JIMMY

-- cause I raced down there to get
you, smart ass. You know none’a these
neighborhoods are particularly great
for leaving kids around unsupervised
and shit.

(beat)
Am I right?

Eli holds a moment. True. But wary. Jimmy returns attention
to the road ahead. PUTS the PEDAL to the floor --

INT. HROBSKY HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

 

Silence. Jimmy's tending to his injuries. Trying to. The
facade is dropped in here. And Jimmy's reeling --

He looks to his expression in the mirror. Stems the tide.
His heart won’t stop POUNDING. Jimmy chokes back on emotion.

Tries to straighten. Next moves. Next moves. Next moves...

INT. HROBSKY HOME - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

 

Jimmy steps out. Can see up the hallway into the KITCHEN.

Eli's there, drinking ORANGE JUICE from the carton.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

 

Jimmy enters, holding his phone to his ear. Play talking.

JIMMY
No kidding. Yeah. Yeah. I mean -- I
guess so. Okay.
(nods to Eli)
Yeah, he's here. Wanna talk to him?
Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good.

Jimmy fake hangs up. Clicks his tongue as though digesting.
He’s had some time to work on his aura of calm now, but the
cracks are still slightly visible. He paces to the fridge --

JIMMY
This is gonna blow your mind.
35.

ELI
What?

JIMMY
It's fucked up down there. Like --
all hands on deck bad. This spill?
It’s gonna take like four to six
days to clean up. That’s pulling
round the clock shifts --

ELI

Did they catch the guys?
JIMMY

Who?
ELI

The guys who broke in.

JIMMY
Oh. Uh. No. I dunno. But listen.
Dad's gonna be down there all night
tonight and non-stop -- the next
couple days working on this.

Eli takes this in. Huh. Considering what this means...

JIMMY
And he says. This is what he said
to me -- he doesn’t want you around

here unsupervised causing a bunch
of trouble. Won’t have it.

ELI
Yeah, that sounds like Dad --

JIMMY
He was talking about doing some,
ah. Asking me to look into some
after-school type thing for you --
like a daycare thing --

ELI
Daycare?? I’m twelve, I’m not --

Jimmy HOLDS up a finger --

JIMMY
I talked to him. It wasn’t easy, as
you know -- cause he’s not exactly
super happy with me either.
(then)
I tied it into our whole thing. Me,
him and you. We’re in a state.
36.

JIMMY (CONT'D)

And in terms of family now, it’s
just us. Like. I’ve been away,
you've been working hard at school

and --

(guessing)
-- it’s been a minute since we did
anything like -- you know. Bonding.

Eli’s listening. Not disagreeing but waiting for the point --

JIMMY
So.
(then)
I said maybe it’d be good for us to
all take a little... vacation.

Eli slows. Takes in this development. Jimmy’s into his pitch

now. It took him a second -- but he’s pretty convincing...

ELI

Like. All of us?
JIMMY

Yeah, man! Me you and dad. Well.

Just you and me at first -- since

he’s got his thing to deal with,

but yeah -- a little road trip, you

know? And then, dad‘’1ll --
Jimmy strains.
Holding together the lie becomes hard with this next part --

JIMMY
-- he’1l meet us there.

ELI
Meet us where?

JIMMY
You remember that cottage we all
used to go to near Lake Tahoe? The
one we used to rent out on summers?
It was a while ago.

ELI
A little.

JIMMY
You were pretty young. Perfect
hideaway, I’m thinking.
37.

EXT. I-75 - CONTINUOUS

A scary ass DELTA 88 and a CUTLASS CIERA cut past us. Flying.
En route for the Caniff EXIT RAMP.

INSIDE the latter, packed in along a new group of PEERS,
Taylor and his entire crew are loading bullets into clips.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

ELI
Dad’s cool with this?

-- and so Jimmy makes his final gambit...

JIMMY
Yeah, man. You wanna call him --
ask him yourself? Go ahead.

+. Jimmy offers Eli his cell phone. Eli takes it...

JIMMY

Heads up, though -- I think I might
just go either way. I’ve been
locked inside too many small rooms
for too damn long.

(then)
So you want adventure or chores?
Your call.

Moment of truth. Eli eyes the phone in his hands...

«+. and doesn't call. Hands it back to Jimmy. Who CLAPS.

JIMMY
Get your shit. Five minutes. Go.
ELI
Now?
JIMMY
Let's go!
Eli moves. Jimmy watches him go... the veil receding.

INT. ELI'S ROOM - NIGHT

Eli sets to it. He stuffs a couple shirts, socks, tooth-brush
into his backpack --

INT. HROBSKY HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

 

Jimmy TUGS an OLD TRUNK free from storage. Pulls it open to
find -- clothing. A little dated but whatever. Boots. Shades.
INT. ELI’S ROOM - NIGHT

Eli drops down to peer beneath the bed. At the DUFFLE BAG. He

considers. Bring it or no... Eli does. Begins to PACK over
THE WEAPON.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

 

Jimmy searches out a satchel. STUFFS the PISTOL in first.
Then the BLACK GARBAGE BAG. Then clothing. Whatever fits --
EXT. HROBSKY HOME - NIGHT

ANGLE: Eli's backpack and the DUFFLE BAG with THE WEAPON are
tossed in the truck next to Jimmy’s satchel -- he strains --

JIMMY
Damn, Eli. Brought your whole room --

MOMENTS LATER: Jimmy's gunning it away. HAL'S TRUCK a set of
tail-lights just as -- the camera loiters -- PANS -- to the
OTHER SIDE of the BLOCK. The opposite direction...

TWO SETS OF HEADLIGHTS come TEARING AROUND the far CORNER.
The DELTA and CUTLASS come THUNDERING UP.

INT. HROBSKY HOME - NIGHT

The front door is KICKED OPEN. Taylor enters, still blood
spattered, dragging his leg along now, with EIGHT MORE
CRONIES at his side. It's quiet.

TAYLOR
Toss this shit.

SNICK (20s), a biker prospect looking type, STEPS forward --

EXT. HROBSKY HOME - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE: PULLING slowly off the porch as the sound of
destruction begins. As everything in this well-loved home is
SMASHED. LOUDER and --
39.

EXT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - NIGHT

 

Silence. And we return to this MONSTROSITY of a structure.
The MASSIVE CHAMBER where Eli first stumbled across THE
WEAPON. And we're not alone. TWO FIGURES move into frame.
Silent. Eerie. Hard to make out in the darkness --

ONE OF THEM tosses a fistfull of what look like MARBLES into
the air -- where they stay. Mechanical. HOVERING. Then. They
FAN OUT. ILLUMINATING the darkness. And WE REVEAL:

The two FIGURES are wearing the same type of OTHER-WORLDLY
ARMOR we saw on the ALIEN BODIES Eli discovered here earlier.

We'll call these figures THE CLEANERS. And we can take a
guess as to what they're looking for.

They move through the space, each using SCANNING DEVICES as
they go. One slows -- keys a command in and --

FOOTSTEPS in gravel and dust illuminate. Eli's footsteps.
SEVERAL of the marble-like devices SWOOP IN overhead, slow --
TRACING Eli's footpath forward. To the ELEVATOR SHAFT --

INT. DERELICT SHIPPING SITE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

 

One of the Cleaners DROPS STRAIGHT down to the bottom. A
WHIRRR sounds from his MECHANIZED BOOTS. SHOCK SUPPORT --

The Cleaner turns. No sign of THE WEAPON --

The other Cleaner approaches a window. Looks out through
broken glass. Over distant city lights and THE REST OF OUR
WORLD...

INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - FREEWAY - IOWA - PRE-DAWN

 

HAL'S TRUCK SAILS PAST us into wide horizons of midwest farm-—
land. The distance beginning to glow. A new day on approach.

Jimmy’s at the wheel, looking like straight up death.
A face that’s clearly just driven through the night. His

expression a void. His eyes lost. Alone with proverbial blood
on his hands. Eli sleeps peacefully, riding shotgun.
40.

INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - FREEWAY - IOWA - LATER

The truck JOSTLES a moment and Eli stirs. Groggy. Lifts his
head up off the hoodie he was using as a pillow --

JIMMY
Rise and shine. Welcome to Iowa...

Eli looks up. Sees infinite expanses of farmland. That's it.

JIMMY
.-- home of, ah -- fields? Lots of
fields... the amish, maybe? I dunno.

(sees, up ahead)
And... oh shit...

INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - DAY
Jimmy enters, smiles -- Eli following close behind --
JIMMY
All-in-one trucker paradise coves.
These places are really weird but
awesome. Need a shower? Nap? Fifty
different types of jerky? They got
you.

Jimmy pointing as he goes. Eli takes the strangeness of this
place in... like a sprawling compound for crazies...

JIMMY
Most importantly though --

Jimmy halts at the SIGHT OF THIS PLACE'S ANCIENT ARCADE.
JIMMY

Fully functional old school arcades.

INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - ARCADE - DAY

 

Jimmy and Eli are playing the TERMINATOR 2 ARCADE GAME. You
remember it. Don't even lie. Jimmy's enthralled...

JIMMY
You gotta picture coming up to this
thing in 94 at like a roller rink
or something -- a game that had
Machine guns you could use to shoot
evil cyborgs --

Eli doesn’t really get it. And maybe he’s got a point. In
truth, it really hasn’t aged well...
41.

JIMMY
-- this thing gave me sooooo many
nightmares, I’m telling you.

ELI
Really?

Jimmy shoves a fist full of quarters into Eli’s hand.
JIMMY
Here. Take over. I’ve gotta grab
something from the truck --
EXT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - DAY
Jimmy's HOISTED a clunky toolbox out of Hal’s extended cab.
Reaching for a SCREWDRIVER, he crosses the lot -- cautious.

He moves for a CAR parked in silence around the side --

-- leans down fast and begins unscrewing its PLATES.

INT. SUPER TRUCK STOP - CHECK-OUT - A SHORT TIME LATER

 

Jimmy now grips a carton of smokes, energy drinks and a bag
of chips on the counter. He turns as Eli walks up --

JIMMY
What'd you get?

-- Eli tosses in a bag of combos and a 20 oz coke. Jimmy pays
hurriedly with a new hundred dollar bill --

Eli idles, meanwhile, looks into a nearby dining area --

Where A FAMILY OF FOUR, a MOTHER, FATHER and TWO SONS right
around Eli’s age, are eating together. Gabbing.

Very likely also on vacation. But in a way that tells us:
This is a happy, functional family. The moment’s INTERRUPTED
as Jimmy slaps Eli’s combos and soda into his hands --
JIMMY
C’mon -- the open road is calling.

INT. TATTERED HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

 

ANGLE: we’re moving up the short hallway en route toward’s
Taylor’s gross and disgusting kitchen.

TAYLOR -- with his leg crudely bandaged, is seated atop his
battered, cigarette burned table, facing away from us.
42.
The curtains are closed. Light from outside fights its way in
via JAGGED SLIVERS here and there --

What sounds at first like LOUD BREATHS coming from Taylor
become SOBS. Weird whimpers GASPING out between --

WE MOVE around him now until we can see his face. Tears and
hurt and loss swilling outward past bloodshot eyes and a

tweaker’s stare. Taylor STANDS, PACES -- movements erratic.
Growing moreso. Caged. Until he turns, EXPLODES -- FLIPS his
TABLE -- as it CARTWHEELS we CUT TO --

INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - IOWA FREEWAYS - DAY

 

Jimmy and Eli DRIVE. TRAVERSING the featureless endlessness
that is this section of the country. MUSIC PLAYS. Eli wears a
pair of what look like Hal's sunglasses. Eating combos.

The silence gnaws a little at Jimmy, checks the rear view
again, and then --

JIMMY
So. You got a girlfriend?

Eli looks at him. Shrugs.

JIMMY
That's either the best or worst
response that's ever been given to
that question.
(beat)
Do you really not know?

Eli looks at Jimmy.

ELI
It's none of your business.

JIMMY
But I'm family. You can share that
shit with me --
(Eli stays quiet)
Don't get me wrong -- I'd be up for
telling you about my love life, but
I just got out of prison. All my
shit ranges from uncomfortable to
downright terrifying. No?
(still nothing)
Suit yourself -- so there was this
Spanish guy, right? Spanish-ish.
43.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Named Rafi -- who kept sneaking me
smokes all the time and I'm like,
why's this guy being so nice to me?
One day I’m in the shower, minding
my own business and he comes up to
me all like --
(sleezy)

Yo man, ay. Gimme a back rub, son.
And I’m like --

ELI
(interrupts)
Ahh -- STOP. Please. Just stop --

Jimmy looks at Eli. Beat. Shit-eating grin flashing forward
again. Eli, annoyed, goes back to his combos --

JIMMY
You don’t wanna hear the rest a’my
story? It’s got a happy ending --
(beat, grinning)
-- get it? Are you old enough to
get that?

Eli looks at Jimmy. Beat. After a moment, Eli shakes his head
and grins. Outside, they pass a SIGN: WELCOME TO NEBRASKA!
EXT. HOTEL - RURAL NEBRASKA - DUSK
ANGLE: We're parked. Carefully around the side out of view
from the road. Jimmy reaches into his satchel for the BLACK
PLASTIC BAG filled with money --
He makes sure Eli's not watching, removes a couple hundreds.
JIMMY (PRE-LAP)

Go to town. Sky’s the limit.
INT. VENDING MACHINES - HOTEL - RURAL NEBRASKA - DUSK
Jimmy and Eli are standing in front of a vending machine.

ELI
I had combos for lunch --

JIMMY
Heaven right? C’mon. Candy bars for
dinner. Go nuts.

ELI
Yeah... uh. I’m not six.
(nods to the machine)
44,

ELI (CONT'D)
You know all this stuff is bad for
you, right? Like. There’s zero
nutritional value here --

-- Jimmy's distracted. Listening to the sound of POLICE
SIRENS in approach. Holding until they pass. Jimmy watches a
HIGHWAY PATROL CAR RACE by the hotel -- and it’s GONE.

Jimmy sees that Eli noticed the whole thing. Offers a smile.
JIMMY
Old habits.
(then, turns)
Alright. Fine. Kid wants a Kale salad
apparently. Let’s go, Jenny Craig.
Jimmy motions Eli along. Out into the lot.
JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
How many can you do? I'm serious --

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmy and Eli in the hotel room. Dinner aftermath is
everywhere. Jimmy's pulling from a fifth of whiskey. Drunk.

ELI
I dunno, as many as I want.
JIMMY
No, like -- I'm talking about in a

row. All in a row.
Eli shrugs. Jimmy swigs, motions to the room in front of them.

JIMMY
Now's your chance, man. Go, go, go!

Eli smiles, beat.

ELI
Twenty bucks if I make it to six.

JIMMY
Pssh. Fifty.

Eli accepts. Crosses -- and BEGINS DOING CARTWHEELS across
the room. SPECTACULARLY DROP KICKS a lamp in passing.

Jimmy SPIT TAKES as it hits a WALL, SMASHES --

Eli looks -- relieved to find that Jimmy thinks this is
hilarious, then pauses -- sensing it. Eli crosses --
45.

JIMMY
(reaches )

The hotel’s gonna want their cut’a

this fifty -- be warned...
Jimmy watches Eli as he reaches for his coat pocket and the
inhaler inside -- Eli uses it. Laughs. Takes a BREATH --
INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT
With the shower running, Eli's brought the DUFFLE BAG into the
bathroom. THE WEAPON is out and TURNED ON. Eli’s using the
TARGETING SYSTEM to take aim at different objects --

-- Eli's hand grazes the trigger a moment. Doesn't pull.
Curiosity growing. Eli eyeballs THE WEAPON in his hands.

What are you?

On the left side of the gun, along the lower barrel, Eli
spots a blinking GREEN NODE. Not a trigger, something else --

-- cautiously, he runs his finger across it --

KR-SHRRR-VRRRP. The WEAPON JOLTS in his hands as he does. Two
sleek appendages extend sideways like recoil dampeners --

-- the BARREL SHORTENS. Like a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN --

Eli holds a moment in awe of this thing’s self-adjusting
design. Tries it AGAIN -- and THE WEAPON takes on YET ANOTHER
CONFIGURATION. Different MODES. Insane.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Eli exits the bathroom, THE WEAPON inside the duffle again.
Washed up, ready for bed. He looks --

Jimmy's passed out on his bed. The empty fifth now dangling
from his fingertips. BUT -- left out on the table stand:

Is a pair of CHUCK TAYLORS maybe one size too big. Beat. Eli
looks this gift over -- a note on hotel stationary reads:

HOOKED YOU UP AS PROMISED. BIG BROTHER.
Eli grins. Looks to Jimmy -- and spots his packed satchel at

the base of nightstand. Poking into view is the corner of a
framed PICTURE. Eli moves closer and pulls it into view...
46.

... it’s a familiar FRAMED PHOTO. The image of a YOUNGER HAL
with his arms around Jimmy’s MOTHER. Jimmy must've swiped it
from the living room before they left.

Eli looks to Jimmy, passed out -- why would he have this?
EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
ANGLE: Eli’s feet, clad in those Chucks. Stepping out of the

room, closing the door behind. They’re a pretty good fit --

EXT. HOTEL ROOMS - WANDERING - MOMENTS LATER

 

Eli moves through the space in early morning light. Weaving
through modest corridors of closed doors -- Eli slows --

-- finds himself on the SECOND FLOOR. Looking down into a
courtyard where a battered ELDERLY GROUNDSKEEPER is skimming
the hotel’s tiny pool. The GROUNDSKEEPER looks up, sees Eli.

GROUNDSKEEPER
Morning. Up with the sunrise, huh?

Eli shrugs. The Groundskeeper eyes him a moment. Smiles.
GROUNDSKEEPER
There’s never enough time in the
day, am I right?
The Groundskeeper goes back to his work -- Eli watches him
go, then sits, his legs dangling through the railing --
INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE MORNING

Piercing WHITE LIGHT stabs through windows even with the
curtains drawn. Eli's shaking Jimmy to wake up.

ELI
Jimmy. Jimmy.
Jimmy stirs. Eyes puffy and red and hungover -- groggy --
JIMMY

Hmmmm? Wha?

ELI
We're supposed to check out twenty
minutes ago.

Dammit. Jimmy mumbles, incoherent. Fumbles for the truck keys.
47.

JIMMY
Uh. Kay. Pull the truck around and
I'll be right out.

ELI
I can't drive.

JIMMY
Sure you can.

ELI
No. Like -- I don't know how.

Jimmy opens one eye at Eli, wiping away an eyelash booger.

EXT. DIRT LOT BEHIND THE HOTEL - MORNING

 

Jimmy, looking like death behind his sunglasses -- smokes and
grips a black coffee like a lifeline. Satchel is at his feet --

JIMMY
Now the trick to perfecting the
neutral slam --

Eli's BEHIND THE WHEEL of Hal's truck just ahead. REVVING it.

JIMMY
Is not panicking when you drop it
into gear! Crank the wheel to your
left, and keep your foot on the gas
no matter what! Don’t be scared!
(re: engine revving)
No matter what happens! More!

Eli does. He's in NEUTRAL. Revs the engine into the red --

ELI
Like this?? Are you serious?

JIMMY
Just trust me, okay?! HOLD IT AND --

Eli looks to the dash. HAL'S TRUCK ENGINE like a snarling
monster at the brink --

ELI JIMMY
NOW? NOW!

Eli throws it into DRIVE. HOLDS the WHEEL LEFT as the truck
LUNGES FORWARD and SPRAYS GRAVEL -- FISHTAILING away --

Jimmy, behind him, dodging the CLOUD of dust that's kicked up
in Eli's wake as he TEARS away behind the wheel.
48.
Doing 40 mph DOUGHNUTS. A CLOUD of DUST KICKING UP around the
truck.
ANGLE: Eli at the wheel of Hal's truck. The world a whirling
blur. Slow motion. Eli hangs on, having the time of his life
while gripping the wheel.

EXT. WYOMING - RURAL FREEWAY - DAY

Hal's truck, covered in dust now, SAILS past a SIGN: WELCOME
TO WYOMING! We’re on smaller roadways now. Discreet travel.

Eli, with his window rolled down, takes the sting of whipping
air against his fingers in and sees --

OUT THE WINDOW: a CROP DUSTER matching pace with Eli and
Jimmy in the air above -- spraying farmland dotted by WIND
TURBINES which pass like looming giants -- an aerial dance --

-- and Eli watches, enthralled.

EXT. BUSTED UP TRAILER - TRAILER PARK - ROCKIES - DAY

 

We’re most definitely not in Wyoming.

Overgrown reeds threaten to devour a half-collapsed and
rusted out number tethered to the underbelly of a COLORADO
ROCKY MOUNTAIN. Who knows which one --

-- KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK -—

INT. BUSTED UP TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

 

BONNIE (20s) a rough and rural-looking glam rock enthusiast
with a big black eye is BANGING away on this unit’s closed
back bedroom door --

BONNIE
You still owe me rent, bitch!

The door JOSTLES and opens to reveal the face of MILLY (young
30s), beautiful. Even having just-crawled-out-of-bed. Beat.

BONNIE
Really? Who the hell sleeps in this
late?

MILLY
Vampires.
(then)
What do you want?
49.

BONNIE
Lee’s on the phone and he says
you're not picking up.

Milly anti-responds.

BONNIE

He says he needs you to come in and
told me to remind you about what
happened the last time you avoided
him --

(off Milly’s look)
Please don’t put me between you and
that psychopath again. He doesn’t
want to hear it --

In Bonnie’s eyes now we see fear flashing. Milly takes this
in -- specifically Bonnie’s eye -- and holds...

EXT. BUSTED UP TRAILER - TRAILER PARK - ROCKIES - DAY

 

Milly, sporting MASSIVE SUNGLASSES, a short skirt and cowboy
boots, exits the trailer with a GYM BAG over her shoulder --

-- heads for the ACCESS ROAD beyond as a FARMER'S TRUCK
passes, then slows and reverses --

FARMER
Heading to work?

MILLY
Hey Memphis, yeah...

MEMPHIS
Well jump on in. Something mean’s
blowing in from the east we don’t
wanna get caught in it --

Milly climbs in and they’re off.

EXT. COLORADO - DENVER - DUSK
DENVER in approach from the east is not unlike approaching an

outpost at the edge of the world. HAL’S TRUCK BLOWS PAST US
with Jimmy and Eli inside. Out ahead, the ROCKIES loom tall.

EXT. ROCKY MOUNTAINS - SIDE OF FREEWAY - NIGHT

 

Eli and Jimmy have pulled over. Both brothers stand off to
the side of the road, taking a leak.
50.

JIMMY
I'm sacked. What do you think?
Should we call it in the rockies?

Eli nods, zipping up. Moves for Hal’s truck. A thought comes
to Jimmy. He calls over his shoulder--

JIMMY

What do you think of performance
art? You like that kinda thing?

EXT. MINESHAFT - SIDE LOT - NIGHT

Pulsing MUSIC echoes. Eli stands alone in a parking lot lit
by neon SIGNS. Jimmy, standing across the lot at the side
door of what’s obviously a STRIP CLUB, is discretely COUNTING
OUT a FEW HUNDREDS and handing it all over to a BOUNCER TYPE.
After a moment the guy nods. Opens the door wider for Jimmy,
who WHISTLES to Eli and waves him over...

INT. THE MINESHAFT - STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

This place is everything you'd expect a place named the
MINESHAFT to be. Local digs and local dregs.

Mountain girls with curvy, freckled edges and smiles pass a
wide-eyed ELI. NONE are wearing clothes.

ELI
Are you sure this is okay?

Jimmy, with the satchel at his side, takes a shot with a beer.

JIMMY
Definitely a million percent.

Eli looks around, there are maybe FIVE CUSTOMERS in here max.
That and a BOOTH of COWBOY-TYPES in the faraway corner.

JIMMY
Here.

Jimmy's pulled out a large wad of singles. Winks. Hands them
to Eli.

JIMMY
For the girls!

Eli accepts, confused, not sure what exactly he’s supposed to
do with this money but playing as though he does.
51.

JIMMY
(grins)
You do know that’s the whole point
of this place, right? You give the
money to the girls. Or your
favorite girl --

A scantily clad redhead strolls up --

GIRL
You want a dance, honey?
JIMMY
Just getting settled, maybe ina

minute?

She nods, departs, Eli sheepish as she passes, takes out his
INHALER and PUFFS as he watches her to go -- Jimmy grins --

JIMMY
You okay there?

ELI
It’s my asthma.

JIMMY
Your heart rate’s up. It happens.

Jimmy maintains his grin, Eli defensively hides the INHALER.
Aware of the fact that it doesn’t help his street cred. He
looks, pockets the cash Jimmy just gave him --

ELI
Dad would not be happy about this.
(re: around)
You talk to him today?

JIMMY
(watching the dancers)

We texted. He was crashing out, had
-- two back-to-back all-nighters.
He says hi and that we'd better be
behaving. I told him we were...

(smiles to a passing girl)
+. drink your coke, man. Watch the
show, it's what we're here for.

Above, the lights dim for the next act. MUSIC STARTS.
AHEAD: the battered contours of this building give way to an

antiquated stage. Perfect for what happens next -- as a YOUNG
WOMAN steps into view -- the kind that shuts you up.
52.

It’s MILLY. From the earlier scene. A pistol in go-go shorts
now, in costume, her eyes electric under stage-lights.

Moving under the sway of the music -- her clothing departs
one article at a time. And so it goes. And she sees --

Eli and Jimmy. Watching her, stupefied. Jimmy -- finishes his
beer, signals for another, watching -- he looks at Eli --

JIMMY
(over the music)
I like her! She seems nice!

INT. PRIVATE BOOTH - IN BACK - LATER

cuT TO: a private dance. Milly and Jimmy up close. Jimmy's
buzzing, Milly's green cat eyes working their charm --

MILLY
So who’s that with you?

JIMMY
My little brother.
(she eyes this)
Adopted. Obviously. But -- brother.

MILLY
He’s been out there himself a while --

JIMMY
He's a twelve-year-old surrounded
by an endless supply of pop and
half naked women, he’s just fine --
(grins)
-- what's your name?

She smiles back. Not even about to tell him that.

JIMMY
No wait. I can guess. Sparkles.

Milly maintains that grin.

JIMMY
Sparkles? I’m Jimmy.

MILLY
Hi Jimmy.

JIMMY
I'm gonna be direct with you,
Sprinkles, I have a lot of money on
me.
53.

JIMMY (CONT'D)
Tonight I'm gonna get really drunk
and my brother’s gonna get really
caffeinated and it'd be awesome if
you'd join us.

Milly maintains her smile. Doesn't say anything back, but...

INT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT

SHOTS. SHOTS. SHOTS. COCA-COLA for Eli. Milly's joined Jimmy
and Eli in their booth. Jimmy's flying, toasts --

JIMMY
Cheers! To the Hrobsky brothers. On
the road and making new friends!!

The commotion Jimmy's causing starting to draw attention.
That group of COWBOY-TYPES in the faraway booth are getting a
good look at him...

WE HONE IN: on one particular guy in their midst. Built. This
is LEE (50s), rugged with deep-sunk eyes.

cuT TO: Jimmy doing another round. This time with nearly
EVERY DANCER in here. A whole LINEUP of scantily clad women --

JIMMY
To the ladies of The Mineshaft!

INT. THE MINESHAFT - JIMMY & ELI'S TABLE - LATER

 

While Jimmy drinks and flirts with ANOTHER DANCER, Milly
chats up Eli. She’s thrown a shall across her shoulders. Both
are now sipping cokes.

ELI
Seventh grade. Next year.

MILLY
That's a big year --

ELI
Where'd you go to school?

Milly looks Eli over. Likes this kid, the old-soul quality
about Eli. Emerging now that he's gotten used to this place.

MILLY
Where I'm from.

ELI
Colorado?
54.

Milly's accent is more Carolina-bent.

MILLY
Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'm passing
through like you.
(beat)
Where you guys going?

ELI
A cottage. Near Tahoe. We used to
go there before my mom died.

Milly regards that, nods. Looks. At Jimmy --

MILLY
And your dad let you get in a car
with this crazy guy?

ELI
I guess --

JIMMY
(overheard that)
I will let you know this is only
his first gentleman's club -- he’s
here to become a man. We’re doing
life lessons.

Jimmy throws that imperceptible wink at Eli again. Grins. The
other dancer reels Jimmy back in -- Milly looks at Eli...

MILLY
Is it working? You feel manly now?

Eli smiles, but no. Milly nods. Approves of this kid now --

MILLY
I'll let you in on something.
(leans in close)
Walking into a strip club never
made anybody a man, ever. Your
brother's fun but he's just as much
a boy as you are. Don't tell him I

said that.
Eli looks to Jimmy. Laughing at some joke. Doing yet another
shot -- a VOICE calls out to Milly. She's up again next song.
MILLY
(smiles at Eli)
Be good.

Eli blushes. Milly turns to go --
55.
ELI
Oh. Hey!

Milly slows, looks back -- to see Eli’s pulling the cash
Jimmy gave him out of his pocket. All in a big tangled wad.

ELI
This is for you.
Eli gives Milly the clump of money -- in her hands -- and the
transaction is exactly as awkward as you can expect.
MILLY
... thanks.

OTHER DANCER
(leaves as well)
I’1l be back.

Jimmy nods. He and Eli alone again for a moment.

JIMMY
Having fun?

Eli nods. Watching Milly go. Jimmy lights up a cigarette and
lets the music take hold of the scene a beat. A comfortable
silence in the tradition of Vincent and Mia.

Then. Eli looks at Jimmy, curious about something.

ELI
How come you went to jail?

Jimmy looks at Eli mid-drag, considers. EXHALES and ashes.

JIMMY
Grand theft auto. It’s got a ring
to it, huh?
(Eli nods)
That and a few other things.

ELI
Like what?

JIMMY
Stuff you’re too young to hear.

ELI
According to you, I’m old enough to
be in here --

Jimmy grins. Touche. But still -- he’s not saying. So. Eli --
after a moment... looks to Jimmy and...
56.

ELI
I don’t got a girlfriend.

Beat. Jimmy perks up. Smiles. Breaking down barriers. Ashes.

ELI
The girls at my school are. They’re
nice. But. Um.
(beat)
I don’t know. I just don’t talk to
many kids in my grade.

JIMMY
Lone wolf, huh?

Eli shrugs.
ELI
I don’t know. I just -- never felt
like I fit in... anywhere.

Jimmy slows. Stews on the implication of that. Toasts small
in his rapidly accelerating drunk state.

JIMMY
Cheers to that.

Beat. He lets the topic go --

ELI

What’s with you and dad?
JIMMY

With us?
ELI

He never talks about you much. When
he does he’s always grumpy. And he
never took me to visit you.

JIMMY
Would you have wanted to?

Jimmy looks at Eli who shrugs. Jimmy adjusts in his seat.
Picks at his coat as though searching for lint a moment...

JIMMY
The trouble between me and him, you
know, it goes back to before you
were even in the picture...

Jimmy looks at Eli. Slows. Smiles a little more and shrugs...
57.

JIMMY
I don’t think he ever saw himself
in me. He was on one level, I was
on another --
(beat)
-- me having a thing for getting
into trouble only made it worse.

Jimmy sends Eli a look. The liquor now shining in his eyes.

JIMMY
By the time I was in my teens we
had our whole thing -- I mean the

entirety of our relationship --
down to a sad science. It was
arguments and screaming and
throwing shit with mom crying --
(Jimmy slows)
Telling him to go easy on me, then
him throwing me out of the house,
calling me a lost cause and whatnot.

His eyes suddenly searching inward now. He slows. Toasts.

JIMMY
«+. until one day I woke up a long
way from home and I was one. We
just couldn’t’ve been --
(bumps fists)
-- more different.

Jimmy stops. Emotion rattles up in his gaze. Beat. He looks
away. Silence. Forces a smile but -- he’s angry.

JIMMY
What are we even talking about this
shit for? We're on vacation -- why
are we digging up a buncha depressing
shit from back home? I’m --

MUSIC STARTS...
Jimmy's searching for distraction. Sees. Milly. Back on stage.
JIMMY
(pounds his drink)
Perfect. Sprinklers is up. I'm
gonna go cut a fuckin rug with her.

Jimmy JOLTS up out of his chair -- Eli's perplexion over this
response turning to worry as --

ELI
Jimmy --
58.

UP ON STAGE: Milly looks, sees Jimmy staggering this way.
Eyes dead set on joining her --

Jimmy moves to climb up the low seats to the stage when --

He’s GRABBED. By TWO OF THE COWBOY TYPES from the booth.
Pulling Jimmy down and whirling him right into the face of --

LEE. Who's giving Jimmy a perplexed but unnerving smile --
Beat. Jimmy looks at him. Sloppy now. Smiles right back --

JIMMY
Fuck me, it's Lyle Lovett --

LEE
Lee, actually. I own this club.

JIMMY
Nice place, Lyle. Do you mind? I'm
trying to join the lady on stage --

LEE
We don't allow Johns on the stage.

Beat. Jimmy eyes him a moment. Grins. Winks at Lee --

JIMMY

Ah. I get you --
(reaches )

Well how about --

Jimmy proffers a crumpled, gnarled HUNDRED. Drunk. Wands it
around in Lee's face like an asshole --

JIMMY
You and your friends just look the
other way. Go on. Buy yourselves a
nice round of sarsaparillas --

Eli -- across the room, can’t hear what’s being said but can
sense the energy turning bad -- cautiously getting up --

Milly, on stage, has approached to assert calm --

MILLY
Lee, I got it -- he'll siddown --

LEE
Shut your fuckin mouth, Milly.

And that's a scary order that's just come from Lee. He's dead-
staring Jimmy now. All the cordiality gone. Danger visible...
59.

LEE
Look at you. Making jokes like that
in my bar. How big’re your balls,
son? Pretty large?

JIMMY
Let me on stage and I’1l show you.

LEE
What if I just kicked your teeth in?

Okay. This is real. This is about to happen -- and Jimmy --
it’s scary to say, but in a way, he wants this fight.

JIMMY
You could. You really could...
(thinking on it...)
«+. won't help you with that sting
above your nose, though.

Jimmy LURCHES FORWARD and HEAD-BUTTS Lee between the eyes.
Lee SCREAMS and goes TOPPLING BACKWARDS and immediately --

-- the BEATING COMMENCES. FIVE COWBOY TYPES SWARM Jimmy and --
BEGIN PUMMELLING HIM. Eli's jaw DROPPING. Already cautiously
approaching, Eli comes RUSHING up. Milly tries to intervene,
gets KNOCKED DOWN as a result --

Jimmy's GANG STOMPED -- a total shitshow broken out --

ELI
STOP! STOP! Let him g --

Eli's grabbed. Hoisted into the air and carried. KICKING and
SCREAMING for Jimmy -- Eli’s able to watch as his brother
vanishes behind a flurry of BOOTS and PUMMELLING --

ELI
Let me GO! Get OFF ME -- LEMME -—-

Eli's jettisoned from the bar. The door SHUTS. And we remain
in here with Jimmy as he’s brutalized -- CUSTOMERS WHOOP --

Dancers recoil -- Jimmy’s hoisted up onto his KNEES -- Lee,
blood streaming down his face from the headbutt, steps in and
starts WORKING Jimmy over --

An ugly scene getting WORSE and WORSE until --

The sound of THE WEAPON POWERING UP is heard over the music.

Heads turn. Jimmy barely conscious -- looks up to see --
60.
ELI. Having re-entered. THE WEAPON is in his hands. Powered
up and HUMMING and MENACING.

Silence. Every face in the bar now taking in the sight of
what looks like a kid with some kind of VIDEO GAME TOY --

ELI
Let him go. Right now.

Eli's shaking to pieces. Terrified. But holds his ground...

Lee spits, smiles. Turns -- a couple snickers follow. Eli
takes this in, looks to Jimmy --

Swivels THE WEAPON toward a POOL TABLE AND ---

BLAAAAAAAMM !

LITERALLY EXPLODES THE FUCKING THING. BLASTING its FIERY GUTS
straight through a nearby wall -- AN ENERGY BLAST. SCREAMS
ERUPT -- Everyone THROWN -- even Eli RECOILS --

-- backward in flabbergasted shock. Flaming debris spews --
music STOPS --

Eli’s got their attention now -- gripping a WEAPON the likes
of which these people have never seen -- and --

Jimmy is DROPPED. Collapses to the floor -- heaving, a mess --
MILLY springs forward. HELPING Jimmy up in shocked silence --
Lee watching angrily as the trio hobbles for the exit --
LEE
(to Milly)
Bitch, where the hell do you think
you're going?
EXT. MINESHAFT - MINUTES LATER

HAL'S TRUCK STARTS UP, pulling out FAST -- Milly's at the
wheel and Eli, still gripping the gun, watches as --

-- the OTHER DANCER who was sitting with them earlier races
out into the lot. Gripping Milly’s GYM BAG. She HURLS it into
the back of HAL’s truck as it ROARS PAST out of THE LOT --

OTHER DANCER
Hope you know what you’re DOING,
Mill!
61.

EXT. ROCKIES - BACK ROADS - NIGHT
And HAL'S TRUCK RACES PAST --
JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
Stop -- stop the truck -- now --
EXT. BACK COUNTRY - GRAZING FIELD - COLORADO - NIGHT

Headlights break the surreal silence of high-mountain cattle
country -- Milly pulling over...

The extended cab door JOLTS open and Jimmy, looking like half-
mashed shit, tumbles out. White as a sheet -- stumbles off a
few steps. Stops. Milly following Jimmy out, Eli too --

MILLY

Hey! Get back in, we gotta --
JIMMY

No --
MILLY

You need to get to a hospital --

Jimmy's staring at Eli -- points -- to THE WEAPON --

JIMMY

What the fuck is that?!?

ELI
It's a gun.

JIMMY
That is not a gun. Guns shoot
bullets -- that thing just exploded
a goddam pool table --
(freaking out)
What is it?? Where did you get it??

ELI
I found it. In this old warehouse
where I'd been going for scrap...

JIMMY
You found that in a vacant?
(nevermind, crosses)
Let me see.

Jimmy grabs THE WEAPON and yanks it away before Eli can
protest. Still wobbling. He begins fiddling with it --
62.

MILLY
Jimmy. You're drunk and you might
have a concussion -- I don’t think --
JIMMY

I'm f-fine. Just wanna look --

Jimmy hoists THE WEAPON up. Aims sloppily at a nearby HAY
ROLL used for cattle grazing -- pulls the trigger --
instantly, the weapon seizes -- MAKES AN ALERT SOUND --

-- glows a BURNING RED and --

Jimmy SCREAMS. YELPS. Drops the weapon. Throws it down --
hands singed -- waving them off fast, cursing --

JIMMY
The HELL --

Jimmy looks at Eli. Not understanding. Then to Milly --

MILLY
Maybe it doesn’t like you.

JIMMY
You try then.

MILLY
I'm not touching that thing.

Beat. Jimmy's rubbing his hands. Eli crosses, slow and --
picks it up again. Sotto. Looks at Jimmy. Unburned.

JIMMY
So it likes you just fine, huh?

ELI
I told you, I just found it. I
didn't even know what it could do
until back there.

JIMMY
Had a pretty good idea though, didn't
you?

Beat. Jimmy holds there in stunned disbelief. Turns. Eyes
large HAY-ROLL...

JIMMY
Don’t just stand there, let’s see
it again -- in action. Go on.

the
63.

Eli blinks. Looks to Milly then back to Jimmy. Activates the

weapon, aims -- and BLOWS the HAYROLL into a sky-born TUFT of

EMBERS, some of the HAY on FIRE -- fucking awesome --

Jimmy recoils, and despite his injuries and state -- whoops.
JIMMY

(points to another)
Well don’t stop there, man --

Eli takes in his older brother’s floored but wowed expression
and grins as well. Okay. Takes aim and BLASTS THE HELL out of
another one -- Jimmy cackles -- looks at Eli, impressed --

JIMMY
I can't believe you just left that in
the back of the truck --

ELI
What? You want me walking around
with it?
Beat. And Jimmy HALTS mid-thought. Remembers -- WHIRLS,
looking back down the road -- begins stumbling --
JIMMY
Oh no. Please, no, no, no, no, no --
MILLY
What? Jimmy! WHAT?
JIMMY
My bag. The satchel I was carrying.
All my money's in it -- I left it

at the table --

Everyone exchanging looks.

MILLY
How much are we talking?
JIMMY
I dunno -- 60? 70? Thousand...
Eli looks to Jimmy -- surprised --
MILLY

Thousand?? In a satchel?

EXT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT

Smoldering smoke still wafts out of this place now.
A CRIME SCENE. FIREMEN linger but appear to be wrapping
STATE TROOPERS loiter, trying to look badass.

MORGAN HUNTER (40s), poised, dressed up as though for a
out on the town -- pulls up in an unmarked crown vic.

She gets out. High heels clicking. Badges an officer to
past police tape. Her badge is FBI. A MAN approaches --
(30s), her partner.

MORGAN
I was on a date, you know that?
First one since New York.

JAKE
Was it going well?

Morgan eyes him. Scans the setting --

MORGAN
We cooking meth on the dance floor?

JAKE
Statements recount an argument with
a disgruntled customer that led to
a fight -- and ended with gunfire.

MORGAN
Okay?

JAKE
Of some kind.
(points)
The most consistent description of
what was fired has been a bazooka.
Perhaps a rocket launcher. Which is
why we’re here.

Morgan looks at him. Perplexed. Rocket launcher?

MORGAN
Any casualties?

JAKE
Just a pool table.

64.

up.

night

get
JAKE

Jake nods to an AMBULANCE nearby. LEE, flanked by peers, his

nose broken, is getting patched up by a PARAMEDIC.

JAKE
See him? That’s Lee Jacobs. Owner
of this place. Guys got a rep.
Prostitution, gambling, suspected
of worse.
65.

JAKE (CONT'D)
This can be a scary place for a
girl to work -- which is why I’m
not surprised that none of their
security cameras are hooked up.

(beat)
You're looking good in that dress
by the way...

Morgan snickers. Asshole. And the two step forward into --

INT. THE MINESHAFT - CONTINUOUS

-- the aftermath of Eli's damage. The remains of the pool
table are everywhere -- mostly visible through the scorched
WALL behind the spot where it used to be.

Morgan taking in the scope of this. Steps up to the damage.

MORGAN
Wasn’t a rocket launcher. Maybe
something home-made, but --
(beat)
That's a scary thought. See these
burns... the way they --

(points)
-- ebb like that, consistent stop
and start patterns -- no clear
projectile entry point, just --
(then)
Almost looks like a chemical burn,
but -- no residue, noxious fumes --

Okay. This has its hooks in her. Morgan looks to Jake.

MORGAN
This is the part where I pray that
a room full of people in a strip
club with no working cameras --
were at least able to provide
descriptions of the shooter.

JAKE

The shooter was a boy. 12-ish. If
you can believe that. African
American -- with --

(checks his notes)
An older male, late 20s, Caucasian.
And apparently a dancer on staff,
also 20s, left with them.

MORGAN
Hostage?
66.

JAKE
Seems she went willingly.

MORGAN
That'll make em distinct as far as
traveling companions go.
She turns. Eyes the damage one more time --
MORGAN
See what you can dig up on the
pair. The two males.
Both of them moving to leave --
MORGAN

We'll need this area sealed off. No
one. Not a soul allowed inside.

EXT. FARAWAY INCLINE - ROCKIES - CONTINUOUS
ANGLE: we're looking out over the CRIME SCENE that's cropped
up outside THE MINESHAFT. On an adjacent incline. Looking out

over this via some kind of TACTICAL EYE-PIECE --

-- Morgan and Jake exit the structure. Walk-and-talking.
Their faces, bio-signatures and vital stats are LOGGED --

REVEAL: we're watching this through the POV of THE CLEANERS.
Through their HELMETS. Surveying and scanning the scene...
INT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

A creepy hotel in the middle of nowhere. Eli sits nearby,
uneasy in the shadowy lobby, while Jimmy and Milly stand at

the front desk -- Jimmy's counting out all the cash he's got.

CASHIER
It'll be 46.82.

Jimmy smiles through crusting cuts and swollen bruises as he
digs through pockets. The Cashier regards him. Unimpressed.

JIMMY
Forty... six... hang in there...
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A dump of a room. Jimmy's in the nearby bathroom. Eli and
Milly share the small table. Milly’s eyeing THE WEAPON --
67.

-- sitting out and open on the bed nearby, silent, until --

-- SHRK-CLACK! It JOLTS into STANDBY MODE. She JUMPS. The
HARDENED SHIELD exterior snaps into place over it --

ELI
It does that. Here.

Milly looks up. Eli’s offering her some more of the SPRITE
they're splitting. She nods --

He pours. As he does -- she spots -- the ugly scar on Eli’s
forearm. Beat. Then she motions.

MILLY
Where'd you get that? On your arm.

Eli looks. Down to his forearm. Covers it, awkward.

ELI

From my parents. Original ones.

Milly's smile drifts a minute -- but maintains. Polite.

MILLY

Mom or dad?
ELI

I don’t know. I was a baby --
MILLY

(re: Jimmy)

And that’s how you wound up with --

ELI
(nods )
-- from a shelter. They got me when
I was a couple months old.

Milly nods. Can sense the residual heartache in that. Shifts,
tugs at the sleeve of the hoodie she's borrowed from Jimmy --

MILLY
(pulls it back)
My parents gave me these for
crying... I was about three.

She's revealed a small set of dime-sized scars on the back of
her hands. Cigarette burns. Beat.

MILLY
Sometimes people who aren’t ready
to have kids have em anyway.
68.

ELI
You’re adopted too?

MILLY
Just a regular old runaway. I left
home when I was about... three

years older than you? Been on the
move ever since.

(holds up two fingers)
My whole life, I’ve had to say
peace to pretty much everyone I
meet. Sad, but. The way it goes.

Eli’s quiet. Doesn’t know what to say to the thought of that.

MILLY
(shrugs, re: Jimmy)
Is this step-dad of yours like him?

ELI
No. No way. He's like -- always
serious, but. He's okay.

Milly leans in closer, moves Eli’s hand from blocking it --

MILLY
Never hide a scar. It’s proof
you've been places. Done things.

Eli smiles. Small. Jimmy EXITS the bathroom. Showered and
having made shoddy attempts to bandage his face --

JIMMY
How do I look?

MILLY
(grins, shakes her head)
Bad. Should've let us take you to
the hospital.

JIMMY
No. No hospitals.
MILLY
Well -- you look hideous.
(rises)

Let me have a go.

INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Milly’s cleaning and re-dressing Jimmy’s wounds. One above
his eye-brow, another on the side of his face, a few more
atop his head -- Jimmy sits still, letting her work --
69.

JIMMY
So it’s Milly, huh? Is that what
your boss called you?

Milly stays quiet. Looks at him. Jimmy smiles. Nods. A
thought comes to him -- looking Milly over...

JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
So what’s your angle?
EXT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmy and Milly smoke outside on their room’s shoddy stoop.
Jimmy’s blotting his face with a plastic bag of hotel ice.

Milly looks at him --

JIMMY
Don’t get me wrong. You seem nice,
you're nice to my brother... but

you can’t tell me you joined our
little party here out of the
kindness of your heart.

Milly grins. Still eyeing him. Shakes her head.

MILLY
You got me. The plan was to rip you
off and bail in the middle of the
night. Oh wait. You’re broke.
(obvious beat)
All my evil plans were for nothing.

JIMMY
I’m just saying you wouldn’t be the
first girl to --

MILLY
That happens to you a lot?

JIMMY
No, just --
(changes subjects, motions)
-- we got wheels. You could be
after that.

MILLY
Ah. That’s right. Your Michigan
truck with Nebraska plates on it.

Jimmy slows. Milly’s pointing his tone right back at him.
70.

MILLY
Remind me. Which of us should be
worried about the other having an
angle?

JIMMY
I’m just looking, okay -- for an
honest answer as to what you’re
after so we can both be on the same
page.
(then)
That’s all.

Beat. Milly looks Jimmy over. A long moment. Considers...
++. and she nods. Something in Milly quiets a moment.

MILLY

I was stuck there, alright? No car,
no way out. Lee has ways of getting
girls he likes to stay as long as
he sees fit. Understand?

(pointed)
The two-a ya. Walking in and
handing it to em was the first time
I'd seen that happen and I figured
I better not waste the opportunity.

JIMMY
Did he hurt you? I mean, ever --

Milly looks at him. Non-plussed. This is exactly what she
didn’t want to get into.

MILLY

You wanted an honest answer, and I
gave you one. But I’ve got zero
interest in being either saved or
pitied by you. Hear me?

(then)
Plus I jumped in cause you’re not
scary. As in. If you did try
anything funny I’m pretty sure even
I could take you in a fist fight.

Jimmy takes in the sight of her. Can’t help but admire it.
Raises his hands in mock surrender -- reaches for the small
cup of sprite he’s brought out with him. Toasts.

JIMMY
To us bad apples.

Milly eyes him, but obliges.
71.

MILLY
That thing in there, your brother
has? You should be calling someone
about it.

JIMMY
(shakes his head)
Look. We can’t go calling people
about it for the same reason I
can’t go to the hospital, which is
the same reason there are Nebraska
plates on our truck. Follow?

She looks Jimmy over a long moment --

MILLY
(re: Eli)
He’s a smart kid. Whatever it is
you've gotten him into -- he’s

gonna figure it out. Hope you're
ready for that.

Silence. He knows she’s right. Shifts in his footing. And for
a moment, the weight he’s holding is visible --

She spots it. Acquiesces. Scans the lot -- a thought hangs in
her eyes. An angle. Quiet. Debating whether to say.

MILLY
What if I knew a way to get your
money back?

She wavers a moment. Looks back to Jimmy...

MILLY
And maybe more.
(holds )
If I tell you though, and this is
if you even want to do it, because

it won’t be easy -- I want a cut of
everything you get over the money
you need returned -- and you guys

give me a ride west.
Milly holds. She's serious.

JIMMY
How far west?

MILLY
Until I tell you to stop and let me
out. No questions asked. Whatever
it is you’re up to or running from?
72.

MILLY (CONT'D)
I don’t want to know, and I expect
the same courtesy.
(he nods)
You ever robbed anybody?

JIMMY
A couple gas-stations and a three
series -- the latter’a which I just

finished a six year bid on.

MILLY
Comforting. What about card games?
Lee runs one outside Leadville
every other week. Next one’s
tomorrow and if he's got your
money, it’1l be there.

And now, Jimmy's digesting that. Very seriously so.
MILLY
Oh. And there’s one other thing I'd
need.

OFF Jimmy listening, we --

EXT. HOTEL - COLORADO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

 

Eli and Jimmy are unloading bags from the truck -- Milly is
visible through windows ahead. Pacing, brushing her teeth.

JIMMY
I don’t get the weirdness here --
I’m asking you to do the same thing
you did earlier back at that club --

ELI
That’s different --

Eli's very, very unsure. Jimmy sees this --

JIMMY
No it's not. This is getting back
what they stole from us -- what they
stole from us by beating me up which
is what forced you to think fast,
which forced us to run. How’re we
supposed to be okay with that?

Beat. Jimmy spun that good -- but Eli’s still wary --

Eli is silent, debating.
73.

ELI
I just don’t wanna hurt anyone.

JIMMY
We won't. That’s what I’m saying.
Scout’s honor. We scare em, but we
don't hurt em. Promise. Promise.

-- and Eli HOLDS. Now weighing this. Considering. Nervous.

JIMMY
Hey. We’ve got a giant ray gun.
They'll be pissing in their pants.

INT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAWN

Eli wakes. He's on a roll-away cot. Able to see through slats
in the blinds. The sun's not yet up. Eli sits, mind churning,
looks -- Milly's on one bed, Jimmy’s on the other.

Eli sees -- Jimmy's cell and keys on the bed-stand. He
quietly reaches for them.

EXT. HOTEL - COLORADO - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAWN

Eli's in the driver’s seat. Cell phone in hand. Through the
windshield, MOUNTAINS roll away into forever. Eli dials
Jimmy’s cell. Waiting -- hoping for an answer.

HAL'S VOICEMAIL
This is Hal. Try the office or
leave a message.

Eli's features droop a little, but he listens for the BEEP.

ELI
Uh. Hey dad. Jimmy says you're still
busy. Hope everything’s okay.
(turns )
We’re in Colorado, so. There’s
mountains everywhere. Crazy. I
guess, see you in Tahoe.

Eli pauses. A thought coming to him.

ELI
I'm sorry. About me stealing, if.
You know, you’re still mad, and you
still want me to make those phone
calls I will. Okay. Miss you.
74.

Eli considers a bit longer. Hangs up. He looks down to the
keys in his hand, up the road beyond. Then back to the hotel
room. Wheels turning...

TAYLOR (PRE-LAP)

My brother -- prided himself on
being an imperfect man...

INT. THE RIPWIRE - DIVE BAR - MORNING

 

TAYLOR and his CREW, drinking in silence -- passing various
forms of smokable and snortable contraband -- are gathered
around DUTCH’S BODY. Laid out on a pool table like some kind
of Viking funeral. Taylor’s up front, giving a eulogy.

TAYLOR

He had demons, bad habits... but he
spent every day of his life doing
exactly what he wanted to do. He put
fear in his enemies, lived and worked
alongside his family, and he never
compromised. He stepped on the
throats of those he felt deserved it.

(emotion ringing)
My brother Dutch lived his life --
pure. Which is more than I can say
for anyone else in this room.

Pure vitriol and rage are brimming up Taylor’s gaze. So much

so that even as he speaks -- the effect becomes disquieting.

INT. TATTERED HOUSE - DAY

TAYLOR cooks a skillet’s worth of burnt lunch. Smoking over a
filthy stove. Strung out -- and staring hate at a neighbor's

mangy BARKING DOG...

YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN (0.C.)
Tay --

Taylor looks to his pistol nearby. Back to the barking dog --

YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN
Tay!

The young grubby Woman is behind him, holding a mobile phone.
YOUNG GRUBBY WOMAN

The cell you took off the dead guy.
It rang while you were out.
75.

Taylor dismisses the pistol. Kills the oven heat and crosses.
Walking now and from here forward with a visible LIMP --

-- Taylor takes Hal’s CELL PHONE, looks at it, sees JIMMY in
RECENT CALLS... sees that a NEW VOICEMAIL alert has come in.

TAYLOR
Tell Snick we need his phone guy.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

A countrified WALMART. Jimmy enters. Moves for the sporting
section -- five-finger discounts gloves, balaclavas...

INT. CUBICLE - FED REGIONAL OFFICES - DENVER - DAY

Morgan sips coffee, sorting through ballistics briefs. Her
desk a raging jungle of hard copies -- flicking through images
on her desktop as well. A FOLDER is slapped down --

JAKE
James Hrobsky out of Michigan. 26.
Suspect in the robbery and murder
of Harold Hrobsky, his own father,
site manager for a construction
company.

MORGAN
Alright?

JAKE
Suspect is missing, along with his
adopted twelve year old brother --
(eyes her desk, sidebars)
Your workspace is in a state --

Morgan FLIPS through the file, finds a Xeroxed image of Eli --

JAKE
-- description of the father's
truck also matches the make and
model of the one driven by our
shooter suspects --

MORGAN
Any mention of heavy weaponry?

Jake shakes his head. Motions to her desk, a little worried.

JAKE
And uh -- what is... all this?
76.

MORGAN

(re: the hardcopies)
Zero comps. At all. So. They leave
Michigan shooting off --

(checks the file)

-- pistols, and somewhere between
Chicago and Denver they get their
hands on -- something you can fire
in close quarters that has the
destructive capacity of a tank but
behaves like --

(searches )
-- a concentrated energy discharge.

Morgan looks at Jake, who nods. Morgan’s clearly exhausted.

JAKE
So look. You're going home at a
regular hour today, yeah? We were
doing really well the other night.
You were out on a date --

Morgan’s rising, searching for her coat --

MORGAN
We didn’t do anything. You were the
reason it ended early --

JAKE
Where are you going?

MORGAN
Back out to the strip club.

JAKE
You got cash on you? I mean? I’ve
got change for a twenty -- listen.
(Morgan's grinning)
If you want to meet a good dude --

MORGAN
-- that’s not what it’s about.

She finds her keys --

JAKE
Companionship?

MORGAN
Honest truth?
(she holds)
I just want a kid.
(you heard me)
77.

MORGAN (CONT'D)
Fella’s welcome to hang out as long
as he keeps himself useful.

JAKE
Really? Wow. That is cold...

MORGAN
(hands him the file)
Circulate this, would you? Get it on
TVs with a tipline. We need any and
every bit of information we can get.

INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - LEADVILLE - MOVING - NIGHT

ANGLE: on Eli, watching the darkened edifice of LEADVILLE
pass outside the window. A mining town tried and true.

MILLY
The back entrance'll take you through
the main corridor -- hallway to the

mess hall’s on your left.

Jimmy and Milly ride upfront. Milly's at the wheel. Jimmy
grips his pistol -- Eli eyes this.

JIMMY
So I can look scary like you.

Reassuring. Jimmy offers Eli a balaclava and gloves. Puts a
set on himself -- looks at Eli...

JIMMY
Boo.
INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT

A massive auction complex. Scuzzy. Huge. Hal's truck KILLS
its running lights in faraway approach.

Slows then idles to a stop at the shipping gate.
AHEAD: lights across the place's exterior shimmer. Silent.

JIMMY
Okay. We stay cool --
(to Milly, Eli)
-- and in fifteen minutes, we're
gonna be back on the road with money
in our pockets. Ready? You got this.

Jimmy smiles. Nods to Eli, pulse rising -- looks to Milly --
78.
JIMMY
Don’t go nowhere --

She nods, and Eli and Jimmy race off into the night.

EXT. LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Approaching. Balaclavas on. Eli gripping THE WEAPON. Slowing
at the gates. Jimmy scales first, Eli slides the weapon
underneath and climbs next --

Through the SHIPPING lot. TRUCKS with a company emblem
loiter. Silent.

Skirting to a stop at the shipping doors, a BACK ENTRANCE.
Jimmy moves for a nearby WINDOW --

BREAKS it. GLASS PANES fall inward to the floor. Jimmy and
Eli HOLD -- waiting to see if there's a response --

Nothing. So Jimmy motions Eli to stay put, shimmies inside,
vanishes. Eli alone, Heartbeat climbing --

SHK-CLICK. The hardbolt UNLATCHES on the nearby door. Jimmy
appears, motions Eli in, PROPS the DOOR OPEN with a rock.

INT. LOADING GARAGE - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT

 

It's dark. The TARGETING SYSTEM on Eli's weapon the only
thing illuminating -- we hear mooing ahead...

INT. PROCESSING - LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT

 

ROWS and ROWS of bovine. Cows huddled in pens in the dead of
night. Chewing, mooing and shitting.

Jimmy leads Eli forward... pulses climbing even higher...

MOVING through this massive corridor of fenced-off sections
toward -- a SOURCE OF LIGHT ahead... a DOORWAY...

Jimmy, pistol out, inches the door OPEN. VOICES UP THE
HALLWAY are audible. Gruff. Older...

Cigar and cigarette smoke wafts toward us. Just up ahead now.
This is it. Jimmy holds up fingers for a three count...

3--2--

Jimmy CHARGES forward. Eli right after. Gripping THE WEAPON.
TREMBLING but MOVING -- FASTER --
79.

INT. AUCTION ROOM - LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

 

Jimmy and Eli BREACH the doorway into a LARGE ROOM --

JIMMY
Alright -- hands up -- HANDS UP --
(gun out)
Up-up-up-up-up-UP!! NOBODY MOVES --
You know what THIS IS --

-- a room FILLED with four tables of HULKING, INTIMIDATING
RURAL MEN. Each gripping HANDS OF CARDS, drinks and tobacco.

JIMMY
Everybody reach for it! REACH for the
tits'a god and hold em there or get
FUCKIN blasted by my little friend --

LEE, his nose visibly broken, is seated at the head of the
farthest table. Glaring. Jimmy eyes him --

-- terrified, but holding ground and feigning calm --

JIMMY
Hey Lyle -- tell all your buddies
about what happened at the club?
You let us know if you need another
demonstration -- do ya?

Lee looks to Eli. Staring death. Eli, scared shitless but
managing his gameface, stares right back... holds...

... Lee shakes his head no.

JIMMY
Clever. Here's how this goes -- me
and this guy are gonna walk to the

pot...

Jimmy looks to Eli. Both are breathing HEAVY. Jimmy sends Eli
a shaky nod. This is your part now. Be cool.

JIMMY
And the rest of you are gonna play
the FUCKING STATUE GAME. Clear?
(then)
Lyle. I’d like my money back. On
your feet.

Jimmy MOVES. MOTIONS Lee up and forward. Keeps his distance.
Lee begrudgingly leads the way into a small kitchen beyond...

Leaving Eli alone with TWENTY ODD SCARY LOOKING MEN --
80.

INT. KITCHEN - LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

 

Lee leads the way. Hands out and visible at his sides.

JIMMY
Where we going? Tell me first
before you do shit.

LEE
There's a safe. Under the sink.

Moving for an INDUSTRIAL SINK against a nearby wall. Slow.
Lee has to crouch to get at the cabinet doors below, to
reveal -- sure enough -- there’s a SAFE. Lee moves --

-- and Jimmy inches the barrel up to the back of Lee's head.
Takes a DEEP BREATH.

LEE
I'm just gonna open it.

JIMMY
Two things first. One. I told you
tell me before you make any moves.
Do that again I'll blow your head
clean off. Two. My barrel's staying
right here until I see my money
coming outta that thing only. If.

If -- from one thief to another --
you've done what I’d do if I were
you -- and there's a pistol stashed

in there for just this occasion? I
want you to know: your life is
right now, at very serious risk.
(beat)
Now. I can give you a way out of
that scenario -- but you gotta let
me know before you open it so we
can work out a plan. So. Think real
hard about your buddies in there,
about any family you got -- and
tell me:
(another beat, re: safe)
Is there a pistol waiting for you?

Lee's quiet for a long moment. We can see a world of thought
churning in his expression...

WITH ELI: the pock-marked face of the room's SCARIEST PLAYER
is GLARING at Eli now. Clearly debating a MOVE for something
at his waistline -- the SILENCE BUILDING --

WITH JIMMY & LEE: Hovering over the safe...
81.

LEE
There’s a 38.

JIMMY
(nods, beat)
Okay. Dial the combo -- unlock it,
but don't pull back the door.

WITH ELI: The SCARIEST PLAYER'S hand FLINCHES. Eli sees it.
Looks at the player. Who glares right back. Without a word --
a mutiny is beginning to swell in this room... OTHERS saw
that gambit -- now contemplating moves of their own...

«+. without a word, we know it. Eli's losing control.

WITH JIMMY: The safe POPS open. Lee doesn't open it. He
slowly stands and steps aside. Able to see the pistol. Lee's
eyes waiting for Jimmy to make a false move so he can lunge --

But Jimmy doesn't take his eyes or aim off Lee. He maneuvers
and reaches backward with his free hand for the safe until
he's able to GRIP the PISTOL. Jimmy JAMS it into his coat
POCKET --

JIMMY
Take the bag behind you. Step back
over here and fill it.
-- Lee's expression now GLARING.
WITH ELI: Someone’s gonna reach for a WEAPON.

WITH JIMMY: watching Lee fill the bag with --

There's A LOT of money coming out of THAT SAFE. More than
what was taken from Jimmy. A LOT MORE. Jimmy HOLDING ON --

-- the sheer amount of money about to be his. Lee FINISHES.
OFFERS the TAKE OUT BAG to Jimmy. Murderous.

JIMMY
(motions)
I'll take that hat on your head
too.

WITH ELI: unspoken messages are now being conveyed everywhere
around him. Looks, then -- a nod from the SCARIEST PLAYER --

Eli nervously adjusts his aim -- from one heavy to another --

-- the SCARIEST PLAYER slowly and quietly easing a PISTOL out
from his waistline --
82.

Click. Jimmy reaches down. TAKES the pistol out of the
Scariest Player's hands, turns to the room --

JIMMY
Nothing's changed, folks! Keep em
UP! UP! UP!

-- Jimmy shakily nods to Eli. Sends Eli the all-good wink and
nods. Go first. Eli begins BACKING AWAY. Toward the exit --

And HAULS it. A fast walk down the exit hallway as Jimmy
ditches the Scariest Player’s gun and PUSHES Lee forward
toward Eli's former position at the door...

WITH JIMMY: Holding a pistol in each hand now. Jesse James
inspired. Staring down the room of SCARY CARD PLAYERS.

JIMMY
Now, sorry for the interruption,
fellas...

Jimmy keeps his gun aimed. Having given Eli enough of a head
start. Every second more and more terrifying. Jimmy looks to
Lee. Bracing to dart off after Eli --
JIMMY
One last thing, Lyle. Milly sends
her love.

WHACK. Jimmy sends a SHARP KICK to Lee’s nuts before he can
think fast enough to flinch -- he SHRIEKS -- drops --

Jimmy quickly turns -- RACING AWAY --

INT. PROCESSING - LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

 

-- RUNNING. FASTER. DIZZYING. Through the endless faces of
COWS in PENS. A few MOO as the DISTRESSED HUMANS RACE PAST --

Eli SLIPS coming around a TURN -- goes sprawling across the
dusty floor.

Jimmy, RACING UP, helps Eli to his feet. The two of them --

INT. LOADING GARAGE - LIVESTOCK CENTER - CONTINUOUS

 

TEARING forward. TOWARD the EXIT DOOR propped open ahead.
ALMOST THERE as --—

JIMMY
Go-go-go-GO!
83.

EXT. LIVESTOCK CENTER - NIGHT

BOLTING into the SHIPPING LOT. MILLY comes SWERVING UP just
past the FENCING AHEAD -- no time to CLIMB -- THE SOUNDS of
ANGRY VOICES CALL OUT behind them.

JIMMY
The GATE -- shoot the GATE!

Eli, running, takes SLOPPY AIM with THE WEAPON and --
BOOOOOM! INCINERATES the gate in their path. CHUNKS go
SLIDING away across asphalt in SPARKS -- Eli and Jimmy RACE
UP TO HAL'S PICKUP and --

Eli stops. He turns. Looks back toward the sound of their
PURSUERS -- Eli HOLDS --

JIMMY
Eli -- COME ON!
(clamoring in)
Let’s GO MAN WE GOTTA GO!!

-- Lee and the men with him, GIVING CHASE, emerge into view
on the other side of the parking lot. Seeing HAL’S TRUCK --

JIMMY
ELI GET IN THE CAR --

Here they come. Several men taking aim -- and this is exactly
what Eli was waiting for. Weapon ready, he takes aim at a
PARKED FARM TRUCK just adjacent to Lee’s APPROACH and --

BOOOOOOOM! Eli LIGHTS the TRUCK up. Literally sends it
airborne before CRASHING back down to Earth roof-side down.

Sending a crystalline message to Lee and the goons with him --

Do not follow us. And no one does. Eli makes a quick turn.
JUMPS into HAL’S TRUCK alongside a WHOOPING JIMMY --

JIMMY
Eli! You big-balled motherfucker!

-- MILLY GOES TEARING AWAY into pitch black RURAL roads.

INT/EXT. HAL'S TRUCK - PAVED ROAD - ROCKIES - NIGHT

 

Milly TURNS ON the HEADLIGHTS as Hal's truck SWERVES back
onto a paved roadway now. A glow exchanged between our heroes
as Milly breaches the silence --
84.
MILLY
Was I right? How much did you get??
Jimmy and Eli sweating bullets. Panting. Jimmy looks back,
without a word, opens the bag -- slaps Lee's HAT onto his
head -- and begins grabbing at BILLS, HOLDING them up --
smiling WIDE --

JIMMY
I dunno -- ah -- you tell me?

Jimmy looks at Eli, beat, breaking into a laugh, endorphin
rushed -- and THROWS a FISTFUL of bills at Eli.

Eli smiles, PANTING -- until -- he senses it.
Goes fishing into his pockets for the INHALER --
MILLY
Did you do it? Give him the

message?

No inhaler. Eli's now checking his other pockets. His breaths

beginning to RASP -- re-checking his pocket again --
ELI
Jimmy --
JIMMY

(still talking to Milly)
I fuckin did. Got him real good
too, it was --

ELI
(wheezing)
Jimmy --

That last rasp has gotten his attention. Jimmy turns around
in his seat to see Eli. His eyes wide --

JIMMY
What, what’s wrong?

ELI
My -- my -- haler --

Eli's gesturing at his chest. Having trouble talking now.
What transpires next happens fast --

JIMMY
Inhaler? What’s wrong with it?
Where’d you put it --
(off Eli)
-- where'd you put it? You lose it?
85.

Eli doesn’t know. And now he’s scared. Fighting to BREATHE.

Jimmy JUMPS. UP. SCRAMBLES. Over the seat and bails into the
back next to Eli, searching for it --

MILLY
What’s happening? What’s wrong?
JIMMY
He’s got asthma, he’s got -- this
inhaler, but I can’t -- he must've
dropped it --
MILLY
WELL -- is he okay??

Jimmy jolts. A MASSIVE WAVE of panic is JOLTING through him.

JIMMY
No HE’S NOT OKAY now just -- just --
DRIVE cause we can’t stop -- Eli?

Eli? Help me out, man. Where do you
keep it? Did you lose it?

Eli's breaths have now become very scary RATTLES. He gestures
frantic to his pocket --

Jimmy FREAKING at the sight of Eli. He’s starting to lose
color. Jimmy trembling. Eli PANICKING -- Jimmy slows --

-- Eli could die.

MILLY
What’re you gonna do?? What do we
do? JIMMY --

JIMMY

(exhales, focuses)
Calm down, we’re all gonna CALM
DOWN -- that’s what we’re gonna do.
(searching)
Okay. I know this, I’ve seen this,
we're gonna --
(gets in Eli’s face)
-- we’re gonna be calm. Right?
We’re gonna calm down and we’re
gonna let this blow right over.

Eli can’t. His eyes pleading. Very real fear. Jimmy nods,
rallies, REACHES. Rolls down the WINDOW --

-- and he PULLS Eli in. Hangs on tight and takes Eli’s hands.
GRIPS them hard --
86.

JIMMY
Look -- look. I know it’s scary,
but stay right here and breathe
like me --
(inhales, long)
In through the nose -- just -- like
I'm doing right here -- now you --

Eli can’t. His eyes watering up. Forces himself to try.

JIMMY
Good -- out through the mouth.
That’s it. Keep going...
(repeats it)

Again -- again -- we’re doing it
like that. With rhythm. Right?
(continues )

Breathe slow, breathe in that
outside air....

Eli's trying. Afraid, but copying the gesture --

JIMMY
Cause we’re all good. We're off and
away, all those guys?
(breathes )
They're behind us, they’re gone
now. We’re gonna get you a new
puffer, brand new, soon as we can.

-- and we see it. Jimmy’s got his rhythm now with Eli. Eli’s
BREATHING begins to steady again, still RASPY, still scary --

JIMMY
(smiles, mimes)
We’re just gonna chill -- we're
gonna take those long, vacation
breaths --
-- Eli's calming. The outside air, Jimmy’s words -- doing
their thing. And as Jimmy sees the progress -- sees Eli
coming back to him -- a surge of relief TEARS through Jimmy.
JIMMY

There he is. That’s my brother --
that’s my brother right there --

Jimmy plays back the emotion. He has to, as though all of
this was nothing. Up front, Milly’s chancing glances --

JIMMY
Hang on to my hand, man. I got you.
You just keep breathing. Like that.
87.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
(after a moment)
You scared me for a second --

Eli’s CHEST goes up and down. Up and down. Working on its own
accord, fighting its way back one slow breath at a time.

SHOOM. Hal's TRUCK goes past LIKE A MISSILE. ONTO a FREEWAY
ENTRY RAMP. A SIGN tells us we’re en route for UTAH --

INT. THE MINESHAFT - NIGHT

We're BACK in the DECIMATED STRIP CLUB turned CRIME SCENE.

MARBLE-SIZED DEVICES float through the air. ACTIVATING and
ILLUMINATING the scorched space. They SWIRL overhead.

THE CLEANERS are here. Stepping forward into this rubble.

The marble-sized devices flutter like mechanical bees. The
two Cleaners fanning out, SCANNERS in hand --

Approaching the POOL TABLE wreckage --

-- and setting up THREE BATTERED NODES in formation around
it. A CLEANER punches a command into his SCANNER --

SHUNG. And the THREE NODES activate. GLOWING with life --

Before our eyes -- the POOL TABLE and rubble are scanned and
mapped. Waves of light fanning out, measuring...

Followed by the location where Eli stood when he pulled the
trigger -- the height and angle of the weapon when fired,
then...

FOOM. The open space before THE CLEANERS explodes with LIGHT.
As though LIT BY THE BLAST that came from THE WEAPON at the
exact moment when Eli pulled the trigger. A moment frozen.

We can see feint depictions of Milly, Jimmy, Lee, his cronies
right where they were the moment THE WEAPON was shot --

-- but the clearest face we can see is ELI. Closest to THE
WEAPON’S discharge. The contours of his face recognizable.

The CLEANERS wade closer to Eli. Passing right through the
holographic image, leaning down to stare him in the face.
Threatening. Taking in the image of Eli holding one of their
POSSESSIONS. And --

BOTH CLEANERS TURN FAST -- on alert -- able to sense or hear
something we can't.
88.

Each reaches for back-mounted HOLSTERS. DRAWING WEAPONS
similar to the one Eli took from them --

EXT. MINESHAFT - IN APPROACH - NIGHT

 

Morgan is pulling into the lot outside. In doing so, she
spots the FAINT LIGHT coming from THE CLEANERS’ GEAR.

Morgan pulls up, the light vanishes -- someone's in there.

INT. MINESHAFT - MOMENTS LATER
She enters. Gun and flashlight drawn. Cautious. Calls --
MORGAN
FBI... anyone here better announce
themselves --

No one does. Morgan moves further in. Eyes the BLAST DAMAGE
in the dark. Flashlight illuminating this place in slivers.

A NOISE SOUNDS from the rear of the building. Morgan WHIRLS.
Starts forward. Another NOISE. CONFIRMS it.

She CHARGES. STRAIGHT through shadow towards the back of the
club. Through a super SHITTY KITCHEN -- towards a SERVICE
ENTRANCE -- SWAYING OPEN in the breeze --

We hear the start of ENGINES -- MORGAN SHOULDER CHECKS the
SCREEN DOOR, racing into the dirt lot out back as --

THE CLEANERS, TWO FIGURES atop STREET BIKES CUT PAST HER. A
FLASH of their STRANGE, INHUMAN ARMOR catches her eye --

MORGAN
Stop RIGHT --

VROOOOM. They TEAR out of view around the building. Morgan
WHIRLS to give chase. RACING back through the club --

EXT. THE MINESHAFT - FRONT ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

 

EMERGING out the front only to catch sight of TWO RED TAIL
LIGHTS on the way way faraway HORIZON. Already gone.

EXT. NEBRASKA GAS STOP - NIGHT
An IMPOSING VAN pulls into a 24-hour spot in the dead of

night. TAYLOR, SNICK and SIX IMPOSING MEN get out. All are
looking exhausted.
89.

TAYLOR
Gonna hit the head. Fill it up.
Taylor moves for a set of RESTROOM DOORS ahead -- leaving an
obvious question trailing across the faces of his guys.
SNICK
Tay, man -- we, uh.

(Taylor slows)
Planning on stopping to rest?

TAYLOR
Kid said Tahoe in the message.
Which means we’re racing time.
We'll sleep when they’re dead.

EXT. DRUG STORE - CLOSED - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - PRE-DAWN

 

ANGLE: Milly sits behind the wheel of the truck at the edge
of a cracked and weathered parking lot. Scanning the horizon.
No movement. She looks. Over to Eli, seated next to her --

MILLY
Holding up?

Eli nods. Low energy but better now. And we continue PULLING
BACK TO REVEAL --

AT THE OTHER END OF THE LOT BEHIND THEM: is a countrified
DRUG STORE with its front window SMASHED OUT. We can hear an
ALARM ringing faintly in the B.G. --

Jimmy is RUSHING up, his arms full of small prescription
boxes. Grinning, he gets in --

JIMMY
Go! GO!

Milly THROWS the truck into gear. PEELING away. Jimmy smiles.
Offers up the prescription BOXES to Eli. Inside each is a
different type of INHALER -- DIGGING through.

JIMMY
I didn’t know which one to get --
so I grabbed em all --

INT/EXT. UTAH HIGHWAYS - MORNING
Red dirt and swooping MESA now. Steadily traversing our way

into the American West. Jimmy's at the wheel, wearing Lee's
cowboy hat like a war trophy and humming to the radio --
90.

Milly's counting cash riding shotgun, dividing it into three
even piles -- and Eli's leaning over her shoulder, watching
her count.

MILLY
Two hundred forty five k -- and --
exactly three hundred and sixty
five bucks extra.
(looks up, smiles)
A dollar for every day of the year.
That’s a good luck thing, right?

INT. GAS STATION - UTAH - DAY

ANGLE: Milly's patrolling STORE SHELVES. Picks out a LOUDLY-
FASHIONED clutch purse, and nearby, a new PRE-PAID MOBILE.

AHEAD: Eli's at the register buying supplies.

ATTENDANT
Nine forty three.

Eli offers up a hundred dollar bill. The ATTENDANT regards
this a moment -- and reluctantly accepts. Moves to dig change
out of the drawer as Eli waits.

While digging, the ATTENDANT SEES IT:

ON THE NEWS playing directly over Eli's shoulder. IS A PHOTO
OF ELI. Next to a clear mug-shot of Jimmy.

Wanted for involvement in robbery/murder investigation.

From where he is, Eli can see Jimmy outside, palling around
with a group of small kids. He offers one the cowboy hat,
retracts it --

Eli turns back to the Attendant. Offering his change without
a word. Looking at Eli funny. Still, Eli accepts, nods a
thank you and moves to go --

-- outside, Jimmy gives Lee's hat away to one of the kids.
They wave and shout goodbye as HAL'S TRUCK PULLS AWAY.

JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
So we’re in Nevada now... you guys
know what’s in Nevada, right?

EXT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - NEVADA - AFTERNOON

An all-in tourist trap. Casino on the ground floor, hotel
above, flanked by a pair of bars, trinket shops and a pool.
gl.

INT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - AFTERNOON

 

A BELLHOP leads Jimmy, Milly and Eli to a set of elevators.
The three stand silently in a line, Milly and Eli looking out
towards the casino floor, while Jimmy looks at his feet.

OUT BEYOND: the CASINO FLOOR is alive with light and sounds,
but Jimmy is in another place. He looks, over at Eli, as
though suddenly realizing what he’s putting this kid through.
His eyes now debating as though whether he should maybe tell
him the truth.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - WOODEN NICKEL - AFTERNOON

 

Eli sits on the made bed in his own room. Deep in thought.
Beside him. His DUFFLE with the WEAPON inside and a PILE OF
MONEY sits out on the bed. He eyes the latter.

Another beat. Doesn't feel right about it. Isn't so sure he
actually wants it.

INT. HALLWAY/HOTEL ROOMS - AFTERNOON

 

Eli exits his room. KNOCKS on the next door over and pushes
it open to reveal Jimmy, cleaned up, finished shaving --

-- is seated at the edge of the bed. Off.

JIMMY
Glad you’re here, buddy. I wanted
to talk to you about something.

ELI
Okay?

JIMMY
Where do I start, ah --

Milly exits her room one door over. Strolls up --

And Jimmy halts upon seeing her. He looks from Milly -- back
to Eli --

MILLY
What’s up? You guys all settled in?
How about we --

JIMMY
Yeah. You know what --
(to Eli)
92.
JIMMY (CONT'D)
We'll talk later. I was thinking
about hitting the tables, anyway.

Jimmy turns and reaches for his bag. Pulls out what's clearly
a COUPLE GRAND and STUFFS it into his pockets --

Jimmy brushes past Milly and Eli, goes...

MILLY
Jimmy?
(he doesn’t answer)
Jimmy?

He makes his way down the hall. Milly blinks, looks to Eli --
and there’s something off. Eli’s watching Jimmy go --
unsettled. Sensing something’s wrong.
MILLY
Forget him. Pool or food?

INT. DENVER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - BALLISTICS - AFTERNOON

Jake weaves through LAB SPACES until Morgan comes into view
at a reference comp. Flicking through DIGITAL SLIDES --

JAKE
What're you looking at?

-- some kind of research data.

MORGAN
Nothing that wouldn't come across
as crazy.

JAKE

Something to talk about while you're
on the road --

MORGAN
Where’m I going?

He offers her a folder. Printed IMAGES from a SECURITY CAMERA.

JAKE
Forwarded out of Salt Lake. A gas
station on the fifteen, due south
toward Nevada. Three hours ago.

Morgan's looking at the photos. ELI, JIMMY & MILLY at the GAS
STATION earlier. She SCOOPS them up. Grabs her coat and keys --
93.

MORGAN
Call our office in St. George,
would you? Tell them I need a six
man detail on standby...

INT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - AFTERNOON

 

Jimmy wades through the casino floor, drink in hand, smiling
at PASSING WOMEN. Up ahead, he eyes a roulette table. Crosses
and SLAPS down ten hundreds --

JIMMY
Ten blacks. Right here --

A few heads turn. The DEALER, a looker, smiles, doles hundred
dollar chips out to Jimmy. Spins the wheel.

Jimmy eyes the ball ROLLING. Leans forward, Doles his chips
out across the left and right columns. The Dealer waves to
close bets. Smiles at Jimmy again -- as the ball LANDS on 35.

JIMMY
Ah.

Jimmy watches her take his money away. Beat. Finishes the
rest of his drink -- and reaches back into his POCKET...

EXT. OUTDOOR POOL - WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - AFTERNOON

 

ANGLE: we’re looking down bird’s-eye-view, perfectly framing
the rectangular pool from above as Eli treads water --

Silent. Eli considering the uneasy feeling growing. Watches
as Milly exits the hot tub, crosses to the deck chairs --

Eli EXHALES -- sinks slowly under the water’s surface --

INT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - SPORTS BAR - AFTERNOON

 

Eli and Milly, out of the pool now, eat at a SPORTS BAR-TYPE
restaurant. TELEVISIONS line the walls -- most have ESPN on.

MILLY
(re: Eli’s plate)
How’s those tenders? Good?
Eli nods. Shrugs. Preoccupied still.

MILLY
Everything okay?
94.

Eli lingers on that. Doesn’t say. Instead --

ELI
Can I use your phone?

MILLY
Who you calling?

ELI
My dad.

Milly eyes him. Eyes the look on his face.
MILLY
He’s coming to meet you guys,

right? Everything okay?

ELI
I just need to talk to him.

Milly eyes this. Silent a moment. Then she reaches into her
clutch, hands Eli her cell -- something in her knows.

ELI
Thank you.

MILLY
No worries.

Eli begins dialing -- and stops. He sees it.

The news story he just missed in the gas station. On a TV
just past Milly's SHOULDER above the BAR. Muted, but still.

Eli sees his own photo. Right there. Followed by Jimmy's
mugshot. A country-wide search. Involvement in a murder.

B-roll of Hal's JOB SITE. Of Eli's home. A picture of HAL.
Eli's jaw goes slack.

MILLY
What’s --

Milly TURNS to see what Eli's looking at --

Eli CLAMORS. Out of the booth, he collides with a WAITRESS,
who drops DISHES. WAITSTAFFERS turn. Eli CROSSES the length
of the floor for the nearest TELEVISION. Turns up the VOLUME.

BARTENDER
Hey kid you can't --

Eli turns the volume up.
95.

REPORTER

-- two individuals suspected of
robbing and killing a site manager
for a Michigan-based construction
firm. The twist here being that a
pair of suspects have been
identified as the victim's
biological and adopted sons --

Milly approaches. Taking this in -- holy shit. The reporter
CONTINUES. Detailing the cross-country search taking place --

Eli staring at Hal's picture as it returns to screen. Emotion
flooding up. The BARTENDER now spotting the eerie sight of a
fugitive watching himself on TV.

MILLY
Eli -- Eli -- we should go --

Milly tugs at Eli’s arm. Eli PULLS away and STARTS OFF --

INT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - AFTERNOON

 

-- racing for the ringing and flashing of the CASINO FLOOR
ahead. GUARDS at the entrance spot Eli coming. He CUTS past
them before they can step in to block --

GUARD
Young man -- YOUNG MAN --

Milly's right behind Eli. Placating --

MILLY
I'm so sorry -- I'll grab him, he's
with me --

UP AHEAD: Eli's storming forward. Putting distance between
himself and Milly. Anger and hurt and betrayal and panic
brimming up fast. Searching for Jimmy.

MILLY
Eli -- ELI -- wait --

Eli DUCKS and WEAVES through GAME TABLES. Can hear MILLY call
after him, but she's losing ground --

Further and FURTHER. Pasing rows and rows of SLOT MACHINES
FLASHING. PLINKING. JANGLING.

Everything SPINNING -- Dizzying -- and he spots JIMMY. Half-
leaning off a stool up ahead, WASTED at the ROULETTE TABLE.
96.

JIMMY
Hey man! What’re you doing out here?!

Eli LASHES OUT at Jimmy. Sends him STUMBLING back before he
can react. Jimmy maintains balance, drunk, the drink in his
hands SPLASHING away --

JIMMY
Whoa, whoa, WHOA --
(to the dealer)
-- it's okay. One sec --

Eli SWINGS on Jimmy. Tears in his eyes. The SWIPE shutting
Jimmy up as the DEALER behind them presses her silent call
button under the table.

ELI
He’s dead?? He’s DEAD --
(swings AGAIN)
Did you DO IT?!? HUH?! HUH?!

JIMMY
-- the fuck you talking about --

ELI
You lied -- you LIED -- he’s dead
and you lied --

JIMMY
Hey! Hey! Wait WAIT! STOP!

Jimmy PUSHES Eli away. Realizing what this is.
Sees it on Eli's face --
Jimmy looks. Spots Milly off beyond. Her eyes wide -- run --
SECURITY'S on approach. The BARTENDER who spotted Eli in tow.
POINTING right at them. An EIGHT MAN SECURITY DETAIL wading
through tables this way.
Eli comes at Jimmy AGAIN. Tears now STREAMING. SWINGING.

ELI

Did you DO IT?! I wanna hear you

SAY IT --

Jimmy GRABS Eli's arms. HARD. Panicking. Emotion rising up.
Pulls him in. Adrenaline now flooding his system soberish --

JIMMY
You wanna swing on me you can but
we GOTTA GO okay? RIGHT NOW --
97.

Still GRIPPING Eli, Jimmy YANKS him. FOR the EXIT -- right
into the PATH of an APPROACHING GUARD. Here we go.

Jimmy SWATS a standing TRAY of DRINKS -- upends the entire
thing at the incoming GUARD --

Glass SHATTERS and Jimmy BREAKS left -- DRAGGING ELI --
TOPPLING CHAIRS as GUARDS BEGIN RUSHING --

JIMMY
Come on!!

Jimmy's PULLING Eli along. Any direction. Every. ANOTHER
GUARD rushes up and -- Jimmy SLUGS HIM first. The guy CRASHES
away. TWO MORE come sailing in, Jimmy REELS back, SWINGS --

MISSING. Eli's GRABBED by a THIRD GUARD that's come RUSHING
up from behind. JIMMY IS HIT by a RETRACTABLE WAND -- CHIPS
go scattering -- Jimmy tries to rally --

JIMMY
ELI!!

Eli's RIPPED away. Watching now as MORE GUARDS LEAP on JIMMY.
He swings. Wild and futile. The gesture of it worth more than
the damage -- CLUBBED DOWN -- Straight TO THE GROUND --

FROM ABOVE: Jimmy's limbs are pinned as he SCREAMS out and
tries to wriggle free. Can't. Pinned. Clubbed.

AND ON ELI: As he watches -- pinned to the ground nearby, his
face held down against dirty carpet --

-- Eli just stays put. Eyes swimming. Lets it happen.

EXT. WOODEN NICKEL CASINO - DAY

CAMERAS roll news footage. A CROWD of spectators has gathered
to watch LOCAL POLICE handle the scene. POLICE CARS labeled
BLUE FALLS POLICE loiter.

Eli sits cuffed in the back of the nearest one. Eyes churning.
He looks. Jimmy's a short ways away in the back of a different
cruiser. Beaten up bad. He doesn't look back.

Several OFFICERS exit the building, carting Eli, Jimmy and
Milly's things toward a POLICE VAN ahead. Eli spots his
DUFFLE BAG with THE WEAPON inside, now tagged...

And in the crowd just past this -- Eli spots Milly.

Her face among those who’ve gathered -- long -- unable to
help him now -- apologetic --
98.
Milly, her eyes ringing an apology -- raises a hand, two
fingers -- into a peace sign. This is it. Goodbye.

Beat. Eli nods back. Understands. There’s nothing she can do
for them now anyway.

A POLICE OFFICER nears, shooing onlookers away -- and Milly
is forced to leave. Vanishes into the crowd. Gone.

EXT. RURAL NEVADA - LATE DAY

HIGH ABOVE: The TWO SQUAD CARS carrying Eli and Jimmy chug by
us. Tiny metal SPECS against an infinite landscape.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

ON ELI as he rides. Lost in silence.

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE LOCKUP - DUSK

 

Eli's DUFFLE BAG is unzipped. THE WEAPON, protective casing
in place, is removed and lifted up into the faces of a few
GAWKING COPS. It's turned, placed on its end, ominous...

A PHOTOGRAPHER steps in.

Raises a CAMERA and SNAPS a photo with a FLASH --

INT/EXT. IMPOSING VAN - RURAL HIGHWAY - MOVING - DUSK

 

The IMPOSING VAN sails past --

INSIDE: True to his word, Taylor hasn’t let the van stop.
Everyone's faces look wracked. TAYLOR rides shotgun. SNICK
wobbles forward and hands him a MOBILE PHONE --

SNICK
Tay -- look.
Taylor takes the phone. Looks at it. ON SCREEN -- a link to a
NEWSCAST has been e-mailed to Snick.
SNICK
Aud's canvassing all the news shit

back home --

Taylor WATCHES the link. Able to see the headline: Fleeing
suspects caught. In Nevada.

The IMAGE of Jimmy in the back of that SQUAD CAR plays.
Taylor pauses the video. Eyeing the INSIGNIA on the
the CRUISER Jimmy's inside...

TAYLOR
How far away are we from --
(squints, beat)
-- Blue Falls, Nevada?

door of

Morgan's crown vic ROARING en route for the state line.
Pushing it. On the seat next to her -- Morgan's phone CHIMES.
A TEXT has come in. Careful with the wheel, Morgan reaches --

-- checks it. The EVIDENCE PHOTO of THE WEAPON we just saw
taken pops into view. Morgan holds on her first look.

Takes in this thing’s contours. With the protective

shield

on, it’s hard to place exactly what it is -- the moment
interrupted when HER PHONE RINGS. She accepts the call.

JAKE (0.S.)
Scary looking thing isn't it?

MORGAN
What is it?

JAKE (0.S.)
Apparently that’s our mystery
weapon.

Morgan looks once more to the image --

MORGAN
Told you. This one wasn’t right.
(considers )

Tell them not to touch this thing
and that the suspects go nowhere --
nowhere until I arrive. And let
that tactical unit out of St.
George know I’1l definitely be
needing them. Just in case...

ELI (PRE-LAP)
They started hitting him, so --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT

 

Eli sits in a chair flanking an OFFICER'S DESK. This station

spacious, well lived in.
100.

ELI
I ran and I yelled for them to
stop, but they picked me up --

The YOUNG OFFICER (30s) seated at the desk takes notes.
YOUNG OFFICER
This was when you went to the truck
to retrieve the -- item?
Eli nods, the Officer scribbles. Eli looks. From where he's
seated, he can see HOLDING TANKS up a short hallway ahead --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - HOLDING - NIGHT

 

Jimmy sits alone on a concrete slab in this claustrophobic
space. Looks up as a folding chair is set down on the other
side of bars. Eli emerges, sits...

.»+. his jaw still clenched tight. Jimmy looks him over.

JIMMY

Are they treating you okay?
ELI

Yeah.
JIMMY

They haven't charged you with
anything have they? Cause they
don’t got anything they can --
Eli looks down. Jimmy slows.
ELI
Jimmy, they only gave me ten
minutes with you.
Jimmy doesn't respond. Wearing the guilt.

He rises, idle, moves to the back wall... eases his fists
into place against it a moment -- at the very bottom now.

Nothing is said. Jimmy wavers there, fists balled. Eyes
ringing. Stooped like a battered prizefighter out of rounds.

JIMMY
I didn't kill him, alright?

When Jimmy turns to face Eli, desperation is flashing.
101.

JIMMY
You can think whatever you want’a
me, but it didn’t happen like how
they're saying on TV. Dad walked in
on me and -- some dangerous guys
raiding his safe for the money.
That part’s true cause it’s money I
owed em or I was dead -- we all
were.

Water builds in Jimmy's expression. Rallying bravado --

JIMMY
And I told him. I pleaded with him,
to turn around and walk away -- and

he had to stand there and be fuckin
righteous as usual --

-- but the truth is clear. As clear as day in his eyes.
Desperately fighting its swell. Anger and HURT lashing out --

JIMMY
He had to make some point to god-
knows-who and get himself shot. He
wouldn’t just let it go -- he had
to --
(goes quiet, then)
I’m not a good guy, Eli... but I...

Eli, sits there, soul stirring -- staring back, defiant.
ELI
If he was hard on us -- it’s cause

the world is hard.
Jimmy knows where those words came from. Who they came from.

ELI
And a good man is -- he’s -- he
accounts for himself.
(beat)
Is responsible. Even when he
doesn’t wanna be.

Eli holds. Shakes his head. Rises. Leaves Jimmy in silence.
JIMMY
Eli. Eli, wait --
INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Eli exits away from the sound of Jimmy’s voice. Back to where
he was seated, his head lowered out of view --
102.

-- and as he does, we hear that familiar HUMMING. The HUMMING
OF THE WEAPON, getting louder and louder in his head...

EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

 

An AGING BLUE COLLAR DRIVER in a WAGONEER pulls up to a red
light. Waits. For a long moment, there’s no one in sight --

-- until our Blue Collar Driver spots a PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS in
approach through the rear view. As they near --

We can make out that this isn’t a vehicle. It’s THE CLEANERS.
Their ENGINES slowing into DULL GROWLS as they pull up --

-- both parties now waiting on the red. The Driver, after a
moment, looks over at the motor cyclists -- and sees THEIR
HELMETS. Then. The FUTURISTIC SIDEARM holstered on the
closest rider’s LEG --

-- and he stops. Looks up to see that he’s been spotted. BOTH
of THE CLEANERS are now STARING right back. The closest
reaches, covers the FUTURISTIC GUN with his COAT --

And on this cue, both BIKES REV THEIR ENGINES. RIPPING away
just as the light TURNS GREEN -- leaving the BLUE COLLAR
DRIVER in thier wake to ponder what the hell he just saw...
EXT. NEVADA FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

AND WE FOLLOW the two CLEANERS on the OPEN FREEWAY. WEAVING
and DODGING through TRAFFIC at unprecedented speed.

INSANE. MOTORISTS are being passed with such frequency they
might as well be standing still -- ENGINES GUNNING LOUDER --
INT/EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

VARIOUS: The lights of the station dimmed now. Eli sleeps on

a small sofa in the Sheriff's OFFICE. Everything quiet.

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - VARIOUS - NIGHT

 

OFFICERS linger. Still on duty in the dead of night. TWO in
the bullpen. Two kick back in the kitchen. Another works the
rustic DISPATCH ROOM -- lastly:

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - LOBBY - NIGHT

 

The CLERK mans his post up front. CLICKS away on facebook --
103.

-- until he spots HEADLIGHTS PULLING INTO the lot through
dirty glass doors of the STATION'S MAIN ENTRANCE ahead.

CLERK OFFICER
(calls out)
Our friend from Denver just showed --

He yawns. Goes back to his comp as the outline of Morgan
approaches from the lot outside. She enters --

VOICE (0.C.)
Scuse me.

The Clerk looks at the sound of a male’s voice. TAYLOR BOLEK.

CLERK OFFICER
Help you?

TAYLOR
I'm looking for a caucasian degenerate
featured on the news earlier. Got a
little black fella with him.
The Clerk Officer taking in the sight of this guy --

CLERK OFFICER
And who're you?

TAYLOR
They here?

Another beat. The Clerk matches Taylor’s intimidation play.
Dead-pan stares him.

CLERK OFFICER
I couldn't give out that info even
if they were.

TAYLOR
Gotcha.

Taylor draws the pistol concealed at his waist and --

AROUND THE STATION: OFFICERS freeze at the CLAP of GUNFIRE.
The icy realization of what that was up close and near --

IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE: Eli blinks out of his nap --
JIMMY also heard that --

BACK WITH TAYLOR: He moves -- SWINGS open the main entrance
with his boot. Waving SNICK and the REST OF HIS CREW in.
104.

TAYLOR
Yeah -- they’re here.

They ENTER, and hold a beat to begin divvying ear protection.

DISPATCH ROOM: Taylor BLASTS the lock and handle off. The
OFFICER on DISPATCH already RADIOING for HELP --

DISPATCH OFFICER
-- shots fired inside the station --
shots fired INSIDE --

BLAM. Taylor BLASTS him off his chair as --
BEYOND: The TWO OFFICERS emerge from the mess room and aim --

WITH ELI IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE: BRBRBRAKAKAKAKAKAKAK -- Eli
can hear BRUTAL GUNFIRE ERUPT up and down the MAIN CORRIDOR
beyond. The sound of it RAGING up the HALLWAY across the
other side of the BULLPEN -- fear rising up --

Eli moves toward the office door to get a better look and --
SLAM. It FLINGS open and Eli is GRABBED -- by the YOUNG
OFFICER he gave his statement to earlier.

ELI
What's happening --

YOUNG OFFICER
Get behind that desk now --
(pushing Eli back)
-- down. Stay here, DO NOT MOVE --

-- The Young Officer turns. PISTOL out. Showing fear. Shakes.
The RATTLING of MORE GUNFIRE EXPLODING --

ELI
But who's --

SLAM. The YOUNG OFFICER leaves again. Eli watches through
office windows as he joins the other BULLPEN COP -- MOVING
away out of sight. TOWARD the FIREFIGHT.

WITH JIMMY IN THE TANK: Jimmy's trying to see out into the
BULLPEN beyond. From where he is, he’s only got partial view --

JIMMY
HEY! What's going on!?
WITH ELI IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE: No one’s able to see what’s
happening. WE HOLD with Eli through the sounds of GUNFIRE as
it RETURNS. Louder and Louder. BRBRBRBRBRAKAKAKAK --

Eli's petrified -- watching -- now MUZZLE FLASHES CRACKLE --
105.

-- nearer. And NEARER. And FINALLY --

The YOUNG OFFICER STAGGERS back into view. Having been HIT
across his LEFT SIDE -- barely DODGING an ARC OF GUNFIRE as
it WEAVES past, chasing him into view. A clumsy dodge that
leaves him CLAMORING on the floor.

Eli, wide-eyed, watches the YOUNG OFFICER begin SCRAMBLING in
Eli’s direction -- SLAM. He COLLAPSES into the room. Color
draining as blood flows freely --

YOUNG OFFICER
(whispering)
Get -- g-get back behind the desk --
I’1l hold them --

But this guy's not protecting anyone. Eli looks -- frantic
for options. And he --

ELI
My bag -- where is it?

The Young Officer holds. Knows what Eli’s asking for.
BRBRBAKAKAKAK -- sounding out from nearby. Closest yet.

The YOUNG OFFICER acquiesces. Fateful. Motions. Fumbling for
his keys --

YOUNG OFFICER

(re: specific key)
Through the service door -- back of
the station. Ev -- evidence lockup.

THE BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER: Eli exits the SHERIFF’S OFFICE
and stays low en route to a SERVICE DOOR just as --

Taylor -- with blood trickling down the side of his face from
a head wound, a bullet graze maybe -- emerges into view.
Searching. Snick and remaining members of his crew, some of
them WOUNDED -- are right behind Taylor.

BACK CORRIDOR: Eli SCRAMBLES through the innards of the
STATION. Hard copy FILE ROOMS --

IN THE BULLPEN: the sheriff's office door is KICKED IN. The
YOUNG OFFICER dragged out by SNICK -- into the bullpen --

SNICK
Got a last man standing --

IN HOLDING: From his cell, Jimmy can see faint slivers of the
YOUNG OFFICER. Mumbling plea after plea --
106.

Jimmy sees TAYLOR. Here. Twenty feet away -- oh no no no no --

The YOUNG OFFICER is YANKED up to his knees. Jimmy watching
as Taylor crosses over --

TAYLOR
Sorry. Witnesses are a no can do.

BLAM -- Taylor GUNS down the YOUNG OFFICER.

Jimmy RECOILS in horror. Crabbing backwards. Color draining
from his face. Frozen as he slows. Quiet. Then.

HEARS footsteps. WHISTLING. A rendition of a familiar tune:
Joni Mitchell's HELP ME. And it's nearing. Louder...

Until Taylor limps slowly into view on the other side of the
bars. Sees Jimmy backed into the rear of his cell. Smiles.

Jimmy doesn't say a word -- stays where he is...

TAYLOR
Been lookin for you, Hrobsky.

Taylor saddles up close to the bars. Watching Jimmy. Caged in
here... Taylor chews. Aims the shotgun in his hands through
the bars. Taylor smiles...

TAYLOR

(to his guys)
Somebody grab me a set’a keys!

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - FRONT LOT - CONTINUOUS

 

At this moment, Morgan's arriving out front. PULLING INTO the
station’s lot. Followed by an SUV, reading ST. GEORGE PD --
Morgan eases into an IDLE, sees -- through the windshield:

The IMPOSING VAN parked strangely in the lot ahead.

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

 

ON JIMMY: DRAGGED now. Right into the center of the BULLPEN.
DROPPED to the ground -- right next to the body of the YOUNG
OFFICER. YANKED upward to his knees.

Taylor eases the barrel of his SHOTGUN right into Jimmy's
chin. Smiles.

TAYLOR
Your little brother around?
(smiles)
107.
TAYLOR (CONT'D)

I’m gonna do something to you I
want him to see...

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

 

Morgan's out of her car now. Something's clearly not right.
She looks to other OFFICERS with her -- the St. George TAC
SQUAD, getting out of the van nearby, when --

HIGH CALIBER ASSAULT RIFLE FIRE hoses down the lot. Morgan

and TAC SQUAD under fire from one of TAYLOR'S CREW inside the
STATION ENTRANCE --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

 

The GUNFIRE is heard from in here as well. The VOICE of one
of Taylor's men calls out from beyond --

VOICE (0.S8.)
Company!! More COPS!!

Taylor digs the barrel into Jimmy’s neck. Jimmy making his
peace in silence -- Taylor nods. Moves to pull back on the
trigger, and --

TAYLOR
Tell Dutch I say hi --

-- we hear THE WEAPON being POWERED UP.
Taylor looks -- to see Eli. Having re-entered. Taylor taking

in the shape and form of THE WEAPON in Eli’s hands, pointed
right at him -- perplexed --

TAYLOR
The hell is that thin-
BLAAAAAAAAM!
Taylor EXPLODES. Literally. BLASTED out of existence before
his gun can go off -- into a blinding flash of ENERGY and
viscera -- SNICK DRAWS on Eli --
JIMMY LUNGES. CLAMORS for SNICK'S GUN -- The SHOT SNICK

FIRES goes SIDEWAYS. SNICK FLINGS JIMMY AWAY --
Turns to fire directly at Jimmy as he falls -- BLAAAAAAAM.

Eli BLOWS Snick AWAY before he can shoot. Snick’s ashy
remains rain down. TWO OF TAYLOR'S MEN REMAIN IN THE ROOM.
108.

One's FIRING at JIMMY as he MAD DASHES on his hands and
knees. The OTHER DROPS for cover behind a nearby desk --
WHIRLING, MACHINE GUN in hand to -- BRBRBRAKAKAKAK --

FIRES at ELI -- who recoils. Looks. Idea. Eli AIMS at the
DESK the guy is HIDING BEHIND and --

BLAAAAAAAM. Eli BLOWS it straight to hell -- SENDS the GUY
behind it SAILING BACKWARD and AIRBORNE amidst tufts of
printer paper -- THROUGH a nearby WALL into the next room --
BRBRBRBRBRBAKAKAKAKAKAAKAK -- The guy who was shooting at
Jimmy WHIRLS on Eli, buckling in the weight of the moment,
going RAMBO with his AMMO --

Eli hunkers down -- aims UPWARD and BLLAAAAAMM -- FIRES OVER
Rambo's head INTO THE CEILING --

CINDERBLOCK AND FOUNDATION EXPLODE AND RAIN DOWN on the guy --

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Morgan WHIRLS as Eli's BLAST THROUGH THE CEILING sends CHUNKS
of the STATION'S ROOF SPEWING SKYWARD like a geyser --

What. The. Fuck. Was. That.

MORGAN
Tell me we've got backup coming --

NEARBY OFFICER
ETA's two/three minutes --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

 

Eli, with the silence having spread -- chances a glance --

-- A HAND REACHES. GRABS HIM -- YANKS him down behind cover
of a short cubicle WALL --

It's Jimmy. Who's pulled Eli into cover just as -- the GUNMAN
who was covering the front entrance -- APPEARS at the END OF
THE HALLWAY BEYOND -- FIRING --

-- what looks like an AR-15 -- BRBRBRRBKAKAKAKAKAKAKAAK --—

Both of them cover. Scared. As lead BURNS PAST. Jimmy takes
stock of what Eli just did to save him...

JIMMY
You okay?
109.

Eli manages a nod. Brave.

ELI
Are you?

Jimmy... motions to the GUNMAN. Still a ways up that hall.

JIMMY
I can. Uh. Give you some cover --

Eli nods again, and Jimmy drops low, scurries left. LEANS his
HEAD INTO VIEW --

JIMMY
Hey! Yo!

FIRE RETURNS on Jimmy, giving Eli the chance to drop RIGHT --

BLLAAAAAAAAM! Eli sends a BLAST down the corridor -- it
EXPLODES into CHUNKY DEBRIS, but RETURN FIRE sounds back a
second later -- he’s still up there -- well covered --

Eli tries again --
BLLAAAAAAAAM! Still no good --

ELI
I’m trying --

BRBRBRBAKAKAKAKAKAKK -- automatic FIRE POUNDS PAST overhead --
Eli and Jimmy COVER -- BRBRBRBRKAKAKAKAK --

JIMMY
He’s yours man -- take him out --

Then. Eli remembers The GREEN NODE. Lower left side of the
barrel. Eli jostles the WEAPON, finds it --

KR-SHRRR-VRRRP. The WEAPON JOLTS in his hands and two sleek
appendages extend sideways like recoil dampeners once again --

ELI
Come on --

Eli, rallying -- RISES fast into view as down the hall, the
LAST OF TAYLOR‘S GUNMEN SWINGS INTO VIEW -- AIMS --

Eli FIRES FIRST. Pulls the TRIGGER and THE WEAPON EXPLODES
with BLUE LIGHT. AMASSING in a SURGE before --

VVVVVVSSSSHHHHH!

EXPLODING forward in a tidal wave of BLUE ENERGY. Eli’s
THROWN BACKWARD by the recoil as --
110.

The ENTIRE HALLWAY around the remaining shooter IGNITES.
BLASTING A HOLE STRAIGHT THROUGH the SIDE OF THE STATION
beyond --

-- and silence. Jimmy turns. Pulls Eli to his feet. They
exchange glances --

JIMMY
Have I seen that one yet? That was
new, right?? Shit, Eli --

Eli, with the wind knocked out of him a little, nods. The
entire station now beyond them QUIET. Taylor & Co. gone...

JIMMY

Keep low, alright? I’1l --

(looks up, around)
-- go first I guess, just --

(re: the weapon)
-- there could be more of em. Keep
that thing handy -- maybe stick
with the first mode, yeah?

ELI
Okay --

Eli taps the node until the WEAPON RETURNS to normal. Jimmy
looks around again. The coast still clear, so. Jimmy moves,
cautious, motions Eli along --

Making for the scorched hallway. Darkened now -- overhead
lighting flickering inconsistently --

Eli sticks close at Jimmy's side, THE WEAPON ready -- the
moment building -- forward --

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
BACKUP HAS ARRIVED. LOCAL PD now SWARMING into position
around the station. OVER A DOZEN SQUAD CARS. Jumping in
alongside Morgan and the TAC SQUAD. Armed and ready.

So many POLICE the building is surrounded on ALL SIDES --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy and Eli move in close formation through the aftermath
of Taylor's gunfight. We see both fallen cops AND members of
Taylor's crew. Motionless...

Closing in on the FINAL TURN. We see dust and ash fluttering
through the air. The LOBBY and MAIN ENTRANCE just beyond --
111.

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy chances a glance into the lobby now. And sees it. Blue
and red lights. Flashing in through every window. Jimmy
curses. Inches forward, low -- peaks a look out to see --

A PARKING LOT FILLED WITH COPS.

JIMMY
Ah man --

Jimmy turns. Sinks down along the wall. Face wracked. No
clean exit. Beat. He looks to Eli. Face long --

OUTSIDE: and Jimmy can see them GEARING UP out there. Ready.
Morgan can be seen coordinating. Doling out ORDERS.
JIMMY
Looks like we’ll have more company

pretty shortly...

ELI
What’re they gonna do?

A long silence follows. Jimmy's expression far off and away.
Then. He looks back at Eli and smiles, sad.
JIMMY
They're probably gonna come in here
and take us away. Could be the last
time we see each other for awhile --

Beat. Jimmy looks at Eli.

JIMMY
-- I'll go away for good. You'll be
alone again. I’m sorry, I -- it was

never meant to be like this. Dad

was right. Be more like him, okay?
(then)

Less like me.

Eli looks up at Jimmy. Quiet. And there we have it.

Jimmy nods. Sober. Lays the pistol down. Like releasing some
great weight. Slides it away. Looks at Eli. Silence lingers.

JIMMY
You and me’1l always be brothers.
Like it or not. And I'll always be
there for you. Best as I can. Okay?
112.

Jimmy strains. Gets to his knees, puts his hands atop his
head -- ready to be arrested. Eli sets down THE WEAPON
nearby... gets on his knees...

JIMMY
They like it when you link your
fingers. Just like this.
(then)
They'll be everywhere real soon. I
want you to do everything they tell
you, okay?

Eli copies. Scared. Holding back tears.

JIMMY
Elijah. You’1l be fine.

AND WE HOLD: on two brothers. Side by side. Listening to the
sound of BOOTS like a gathering storm outside --

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - NIGHT

 

Officers RACE up. From EVERY SIDE. GUNS DRAWN, SWARMING --
and that’s when we hear it.

STREET BIKES. In BREAKNECK approach. Coming right this way --
Morgan, amidst the STORMING POLICE, turns --

NEARBY OFFICER
Ma’ am?

OTHER POLICE look as well. Taking in the TWO HEADLIGHTS as
they come SAILING IN. WAY TOO FAST AND --

It's THE CLEANERS. They DRAW WEAPONS. ONE PULLS and aims what
looks like a HANDGUN version of Eli’s WEAPON, FIRES --

BLASTING straight through BARRICADES. POLICE go LEAPING AWAY.
BULLETS BOUNCE OFF their ADVANCED ARMOR -- IGNORING incoming
fire. Heading right for THE STATION --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

 

Jimmy hears this -- looks -- Eli too --

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

 

Morgan CHARGES. YELLS to POLICE --
113.

MORGAN
GO!! Hit the DOOR! Don’t let them
past you into the STATION!

Morgan and POLICE RUSH THE DOOR as OFFICERS BEHIND them
attempt to SLOW the BIKES --

The SWAT BATTERING RAM SWINGS.
FOOOSH. The SECOND CLEANER FIRES SOMETHING past Morgan. Into
the POLICE STATION'S MAIN WINDOW. A CANNISTER or --

INT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

 

Eli and Jimmy watch as THE DOOR BUCKLES under the WEIGHT OF
THE BATTERING RAM --

-- as the GRENADE-SHAPED INCENDIARY ricochettes off the wall
beside Eli and --

BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM !
The PROJECTILE EXPLODES.

Jimmy is HURLED straight backward by the BLAST -- The POLICE
rushing in VANISH in BLINDING LIGHT --

As Eli’s form is CONSUMED BY SHOCKWAVE -- he cries out --
And halts.

Nothing happens. Beat. His eyes still closed. Eli opens them.
Chances a look around.

 

Not dead. The explosion didn't even scratch Eli. He turns
FAST -- to JIMMY -- and goes wide eyed.

Jimmy's just a few feet away. But he’s suspended in mid-air.
The gravity that should be tethering him to the floor gone.

As though the blast has hurled Jimmy backward in super slow
motion --

Eli turns. The same can be said for the POLICE who just
kicked the door in -- there’s Morgan -- also nearly frozen --

Dust and debris flung by the blast hangs --

Time has frozen around Eli. He looks. Down at the exploded
grenade-like device at his feet. Spent. As though it's
created some kind of force-field around just Eli.

Eli PANICS. He turns -- fast. Grabs THE WEAPON --
114.

ELI
Hello?

-- out the FRONT DOOR of the STATION. All of the POLICE
OFFICERS outside FROZEN too. No one to answer -- silence --

For a moment, the sight of all this comes with a bewildered
but very real sensation of awe -- and then --

MOVEMENT sounds behind Eli. He WHIRLS, takes FAST AIM at --
THE CLEANERS.

Here in the station. Their WEAPONS drawn as they step into
view. A standoff. Menacing --

Eli STAYS PUT -- terrified -- keeps his aim --

And here, as they approach -- we've got our best look at
these two figures yet --

The FIRST CLEANER is TALLER and LEANER where the SECOND is
STOCKIER with wide shoulders --

The TALLER CLEANER holds the silence. Takes stock of the
small human boy in front of him. A David to Goliaths.

And the FIRST CLEANER steps forward. Weapon up.

Eli SWINGS the barrel of THE WEAPON at him. The TARGETING
system LOCKS ON -- the weapon's power surging warning...

«+. the Cleaner raises his hand in response.

A gesture of calm -- wait -- we see the Taller Cleaner’s hand
has five fingers. Reaching slowly to tap a small console on
his neck -- Eli watches --

AS THE TALLER CLEANER’S MECHANIZED HELMET RETRACTS.

To reveal the face of a human. A man. A transparent breathing
apparatus wraps along his cheek into his nostrils -- aiding
his breathing in our atmosphere.

TALL CLEANER
It's okay, son. Hang on, let's just
talk a minute, alright?

Eli's blanching at the sight of what's behind that mask --
maintains his grip on the weapon -- fingers CLAMPED --

TALL CLEANER
Look. We’re not here to hurt you.
(then)
115.

TALL CLEANER (CONT'D)
But that weapon -- we need it back.
It doesn’t belong here --

Eli doesn’t waver -- gun still up. Overwhelmed, trembling.
Taking stock of the TALL CLEANER --

ELI
And what -- what happens to me when
I give it to you?

TALL CLEANER
Look at your arm, Elijah.

Eli slows at the mention of his name...
Eli looks. This guy's pointing at Eli's scar.

TALL CLEANER
That's your activator. It’s the
reason you’re able to operate that
thing and no one else.

(then, cautiously)

Your parents made sure you got one
before you left, so that some day
you can return.

And Eli stops.

ELI
My parents?

The Cleaner sees the emotion he's gotten from this kid. The
panic and the hope all at once --

A lot to take in. The Cleaner sees this, crosses closer.

TALL CLEANER
Your family have enemies -- the
ones who located you here, who
tracked you to that warehouse where
you'd been salvaging --

(beat)

We reached them before they got to
you, but not quick enough apparently.

The Tall Cleaner extends his hand now for THE WEAPON.

TALL CLEANER
Time dispersals are only temporary,
and this one’s about to collapse.
Sir. I’m gonna need you to hand it
over now. We don't have long --
116.

SECOND CLEANER
(in perfect Chinese)
Thirty seconds.

TALL CLEANER
(also in perfect Chinese)
This is important.

The Tall Cleaner motions. Eli turns, sees Jimmy -- still
suspended mid-air -- but we can now see the faint traces of
MOVEMENT accelerating -- same with Morgan and the POLICE --

Eli looks from the frozen forms of storming police -- down.
Studies THE WEAPON in his hand -- for the last time -- hands
it over. His eyes still swimming --
ELI
But I don’t understand -- am I

human?

TALL CLEANER
100%. And from Earth. Just not this
version.

The SECOND CLEANER steps forward -- takes the weapon, snaps
it MAGNETICALLY onto his back --

SECOND CLEANER
We gotta move.

The Tall Cleaner nods. Eyes Eli -- he can't just leave him
with that. So the Tall Cleaner acquiesces --

TALL CLEANER

We are at war, Elijah. An all too
violent war that threatens more
than you can imagine. And you're
too important to be caught up in it
right now.

(beat)
But just because you’re lonely, it
doesn’t mean that you’re alone. You
will see your parents again.
They're counting on it.

Then. Fateful.
SECOND CLEANER
And then you'll be giving us

orders.

The Cleaner offers his hand. A soldier's hand.
117.
Eli accepts. Head-spun. Shakes it. The Tall Cleaner grins,
rises. Falls in with the SECOND --

-- who draws what looks like a MECHANIZED BATON -- ACTIVATES
it. The BATON SURGES. CRACKLING with LIGHT --

Eli RECOILS, watches -- sees his BREATH BEGIN TO FOG, the
TEMPERATURE here dropping. FROST -- just like before --

GROWS in crystalline formations across every surface, the
ceiling and floor --

-- slivers of tiny snow, condensation in the air freezing --
begin to fall -- leading Eli's gaze to JIMMY. Still flying
backwards in ultra slow-mo but now quickly ACCELERATING --

The SECOND CLEANER WEAVES the baton through the air as though
TRACING A DOORWAY -- the TALL CLEANER locks eyes with Eli...

TALL CLEANER
Be seeing you.

And what can only be described as a HOLE TORN OUT OF THIN AIR
ERUPTS INTO EXISTENCE. Unreal. A doorway to another world --

The Cleaners step through -- the DOORWAY COLLAPSES behind
them. LIKE THAT -- they’re gone. And time rights itself.

Jimmy SMACKS the floor, YELPS -- POLICE BREAK IN -- from
EVERY ANGLE -- immediately and overwhelming --

YELLING ORDERS. Get down -- etc, etc --

Jimmy, on the floor, hands in the air -- yells back that he
and Eli are UNARMED. Eli’s knocked HARD to the ground. CUFFED.

PULLING BACK. From Eli’s view -- everything changed.

Morgan stands in view. Takes in the insanity of this scene.
The frost -- the carnage --

MORGAN
Clear the building! MOVE!

-- and Eli at the center. No Cleaners. No weapon. Gone.

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - NIGHT

 

Eli sits in the back of an AMBULANCE. The scene of the
shootout A FLURRY of ACTIVITY now --

-- every face betraying shock. Eli watches until --
118.

MORGAN (0.C.)
I found the statement you were
giving inside.

Eli looks up briefly to see Morgan standing nearby.
MORGAN
Your brother seems to be matching
it blow for blow.
Morgan nods across the lot where Jimmy speaks to LOCAL COPS --

MORGAN
With the exception of a few things.

Eli remains silent. Still in shock --

MORGAN
I'd say he’s covering for you.

Morgan looks to Eli. He looks up at her. Contemplates that.

MORGAN
Which... I might just advise you to
let him do, given you’re a minor
and you've got your whole life
ahead of you.

 

Eli slows. Digests that. Looks off to Jimmy --

ELI
What's gonna happen to my brother?

MORGAN
He’s gonna go away for a while.
(beat)
But if he keeps cooperating -- it
might not be for as long as he
thinks.

Morgan holds. Looks at Eli a little more dire now --

MORGAN
As an incident on public record,
you've managed to raise some eye-
brows. Crazy looking weapons and
men in armored suits vanishing into
thin air... there are people who’re
gonna want to talk to you.

Eli remains quiet.
119.

MORGAN
But we can go over that later. For
now, just sit tight --

Eli holds on this -- eyes Morgan as she rises, moves off. Eli
watches her go. And then sees --

-- Jimmy, still cuffed, is HOISTED to his feet. Lead away by
a detail of uniformed POLICE.

Jimmy and Eli catch each other's eye. Jimmy nods. Juts his
chin as he goes. Still Jimmy.

As he’s loaded into a CRUISER, Eli catches Jimmy's gaze,

standing there -- ELI offers up that now-familiar all good
wink. Jimmy, across the lot -- grins WIDE, sends it back...
ELI (V.0.)

You don't get to choose family.

INT. BACK OF THE CRUISER - MOVING AWAY - CONTINUOUS

 

Jimmy, with his wrists still cuffed -- raises them into a
little wave -- watches his little brother's figure recede
into the faraway distance behind him --

ELI (V.0.)
You don’t. Just cause someone is,
it doesn’t mean they can’t hurt
you. Doesn’t mean they won't.

EXT. BLUE FALLS POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

 

Eli looks -- out through the crowded lot -- just out.

ELI (V.0.)
All you can do when it comes to the
people you love is brace yourself.

Across the face of the world he can see beyond. Our world.
Eyes traversing its contours as though feeling for what's
beyond. For who. A light wind picks up.

_ ELI (V.0.)
That's just how it is.

And Eli holds... and we CUT TO BLACK.
