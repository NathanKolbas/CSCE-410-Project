DEAD DROP

FADE IN:
SHOT - CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAY

Muted, gray skies, the buildings seem drained of their
color. A sound of wind, softly rising, and then - what's
this? - the skyline starts to waver, ever so slightly and
the image is broken by tiny droplets and then, suddenly,
split apart with the roar of a

MOTORCYCLE

plowing through a street puddle into whose surface
reflection we have been looking. As the surface reforms
itself, we BEGIN TITLES.

EDDIE KOPEK

Rides the motorcycle, a pack on his back. He is in his
late twenties, working class and street smart, dodging
traffic, making time. And getting wet; it's raining.

NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Away from the proud high-rises of downtown, going to
seed. Eddie passes through on his bike.

EXT. STEEL MILL - DAY

A line of huge blast furnaces, rusting and abandoned.
Eddie steers the motorcycle past them to the one small
island of life - a few cars parked at the edge of a vast
empty lot - and pulls to a stop. He gets off, splashes
across the lot toward the mill entrance. He enters.

INT. STEEL MILL - DAY

No ordinary mill: it's been converted into a high tech
lab, holding tanks, mainframe computers, experimental
devices. A dozen TECHNICIANS are at work, drawn from
across the world - brown, yellow, black, white skins ina
casual mix and comfortable style that belies the high
seriousness of purpose in the lab.

EDDIE

nods as he passes techies at work in cubicles, stops at
an office, reaches into his coat and draws out a comic
book, slides it onto the desk of CHEN, about forty. Chen
looks up from his work:

CHEN
New Spawn?

EDDIE
Just out.

He continues down the hall, nearly running over LILY
NAUGHTON, roughly Eddie's age. She's wearing a lab coat
over her jeans, the kind of woman who would be stunning
if she took even a minute to think about it, which she
doesn't. Mostly she thinks about her work (she runs the
lab as Chen's assistant), and when she isn't thinking
about that, she thinks about the long backpacking trips
she wishes she had more time to take.

LILY
Do you have the new nozzle?

EDDIE
Right here.

He sets his pack down, begins rummaging through it.

LILY
Do we have a computer model?

EDDIE
Not yet.

This doesn't make her happy:

LILY
You'll have to make one. We're
testing at four thirty.

EDDIE
I haven't had time...

LILY
Make time. We're not going to
test without the model. Haven't
we gone through this before?

Eddie pulls the new nozzle from his pack. But when he
proudly raises it for Lily to inspect, she's already
gone, moving down the hall. He says, to himself:
EDDIE
(continued)
...It was a hand job.

LAB AREA - CONSOLE

Lily and Chen stand before the console. Chen speaks into
a microphone in thickly accented English:

CHEN
Okay, data recorders and
confirm.

A row of green lights illuminate one by one on the
console. The TV monitors flicker, then images of the
lab's machinery appear on various screens.

CHEN
(continued)
Main stage pressure, forty five
sixty by the mark. Fire and
safety lines to condition "A".

Chen glances over his shoulder.

CHEN
(continued)
We have a green board.

LAB AREA - WATER TANK

empty. Small jets spray water into the tank and it
begins to fill. The wavery image of Ernest

Bucholtz (BUCKY) appears through the water. He's nearing
seventy, a grand old eccentric man of science in rumpled
tweeds, drawing peanuts from one pocket of his coat,
munching absent mindedly and dropping the shells in the
other.

BUCKY
Let's begin.

He turns toward Chen and Lily, waves an imaginary baton,
as if he were leading an orchestra.

CHEN
Main power.
TECHIE

standing near a bank of capacitors, throws a switch. The
building begins to hum.

TANK

Small bubbles appear at the edges of the electrodes
ringing the tank.

CHEN
Injector...

A techie throws a switch as Eddie peers closely at the
injector he's recently installed.

TUBES

as mercury-like beads of catalyst enter and rise to
valves which begin releasing catalyst into the tank.
Eddie smiles in satisfaction. A bell rings, and another
figure appears beside Bucky -

TONY SHANNON, in his fifties, smoothly confident, a
private foundation executive equally at home in the lab
and in the board room. At the sound of the bell, he puts
on dark glasses.

Then he notices a pair perched atop Bucky's head. He
slides them down over Bucky's face.

The others in the lab put their glasses on.

CHEN
Activate the laser.

A techie flips a huge switch and a

LASER DEVICE

glows brightly, sending beams toward a series of mirrors,
which reflect the beams into the tank from different
directions.

LILY

peers at the tank through her dark glasses as the water

inside begins to roil. She crosses to the computer
readout and begins making notes on a chart she carries.
HYDROGEN TUBES

leading to a holding tank carry two ping pong balls,
which rise toward the tank as hydrogen flows and the

BURN OFF CONTAINER

ignites, sending a pure blue flame forward.

THE WATER TANK

begins to shudder as the water roils dangerously. Lily,
Eddie, and now Shannon are mesmerized as the shuddering
increases; Shannon turns quizzically to Bucky, who seems
to be waiting, waiting... then Bucky motions to Chen, as

if he were cueing the horn section.

CHEN
Cavitation sound waves...

A techie at the console moves a control forward and a hum
emanates from the nozzle in the water tank, reducing the
shuddering and causing the water to glow an eerie blue...
Eddie peers expectantly at his nozzle.

LILY

watching the Energy In and Energy Out meters on the

console: the Energy Out meter rises slowly. Chen reads
from the meters:

CHEN
We have a split. Output ratio
at point three... output ratio

at point four...

Lily crosses to a bank of computers, spewing printouts in
various graph forms. She studies them as Chen continues:

CHEN
(continued)
Output ratio at point five...

BLAST FURNACE
ignites: a smallish flame in the huge burner. Shannon

turns, stares into the fire but BUCKY seems mesmerized by
the bubbling water.
CHEN
Point six...

ENERGY METERS
The Energy Out meter stops its climb.

CHEN
Holding at point six...

It actually drops a little.

CHEN
(continued)
Point five five...

Disappointment an Shannon's face. He turns to Bucky,
still mesmerized by the activity in the water tank.

CHEN
(continued)
...and holding at point six...

BUCKY
Shut it down.

CHEN
System shut off.

The techies respond; the system shuts off, the flame in
the blast furnace falters, leaving the lab in silence.
Bucky is deep in thought, absently munching on his
peanuts. At last, Shannon speaks up:

SHANNON
Pizza's on me.

TITLES END as Bucky shuffles back toward the offices.
OFFICE AREA

A stack of pizza boxes on a main desk, Shannon, Chen,
Lily and Eddie sit eating. Eddie is busily sketching on

his pad, Bucky is pacing nearby.

BUCKY
It's music.

The others turn to him.
BUCKY

(continued)
Isn't that odd? We deal in
science, but in the end the
answers come to us from art.

Shannon rolls his unlit cigar in his fingers.

SHANNON
What do you mean, Bucky?

BUCKY
I want to change the frequency
of the acoustic nozzle. Can we
build a device which gives us a
variable frequency, Eddie?

Eddie is sketching, looks up from his pad.

EDDIE
(thinks: )
Sure. Why not?

He flips to another page, begins sketching, absently.

BUCKY
We need to think like children
making music. Excite the water
with music.

The others stare at him, not getting his meaning. Bucky
turns to Shannon:

BUCKY
(continued)
Are you worried Mr. Shannon?

Shannon grins:

SHANNON
No.

BUCKY
But your foundation is spending
a fortune on us. The least we
can do is worry you.

SHANNON
That's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you.
Bucky pats him on the back.

BUCKY
We're close. We're very close.

He turns to the others:

BUCKY
(continued)
We learned something very
important today. We found
another way that doesn't work.

He waves, shuffles off, lost in thought again as Shannon
stares after him. Chen stands, stretches.

CHEN
Lily, take a break. We go back
over it tomorrow.
Lily looks up from the computer readouts she's studying.
She's puzzled:
LILY
We're missing some input here...
EDDIE
(not looking up:)
I'll have it tomorrow.

LILY
No, it's not the nozzle, it's...

But Chen folds the printout, won't let her read.
CHEN
Tomorrow, Lily.
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Shannon emerges, finally lights his cigar, crosses to his
car. He sees Eddie moving toward his motorcycle.

SHANNON
Eddie how are the classes
coming?

EDDIE

Pretty good.
SHANNON
Are you keeping up? Doing the
reading?

EDDIE
Mostly.

Shannon eyes him skeptically. Eddie grins.

EDDIE
(continued)
Some.

Shannon opens Eddie's saddle bag, pulls out a half dozen
comics: X-Men, Spawn, Gen 13.

SHANNON
Part of the curriculum?

EDDIE
I've been trading with Chen.

SHANNON
Trading for what?

Eddie hands him a book from the same saddle bag:
Fundamentals of Physics.

SHANNON
(continued)
Good. You understand this
stuff?

EDDIE
Chen does. He doesn't
understand that stuff.

He means the comics. Shannon smiles, waves, and crosses
to his car; Eddie fires up the bike.

And as he drives out of the lot, we HEAR, VOICE OVER:

BUCKY (V.0.)
We have reached a new stage in
the history of man - a stage in
which the limits of the past can
simply be discarded as old ways
of thinking...
EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - DAY

Various shots: the halls of learning, students crossing
to their classes. Bucky's voice over continues:

BUCKY (V.0.)
We are within sight of an age
old dream of mankind. we will
soon have the capacity for all
peoples in all nations to
extinguish poverty. Simply
snuff it out, the way we've
conquered smallpox, or polio.
And what is the source of this
new wealth?

SHOT - WATER GLASS
half full. We are in Bucky's
CLASSROOM - DAY

and Bucky dramatically empties the glass into a tank and
places it on a small table top, where in a vastly
simplified fashion, he has recreated his experimental
device. The tank is bubbling, storing its oxygen and
hydrogen in small holding containers.

BUCKY
Water. H20. Two parts
hydrogen, one part oxygen. A
rather simple matter to separate
the two elements... we've done
it here. But here's the rub:
the energy required to make the
split, as we say, is for now
greater than the energy we
derive from the separated parts.
But, see the power of the energy
we have created...

Bucky crosses to a small tank of hydrogen, turns a valve,
lights a match... and BOOM - a small explosion startles
the

STUDENTS

watching in fascination. Nervous laughter. Bucky grins
slyly.
BUCKY
It is, after all, the power that
destroyed the famous blimp
Hindenburg. But what happens
when we have learned how to
separate those elements in a way
that requires very little
energy? I will give you the
answer. We will transform the
world. Think of it: fire from
water... We will have an
inexhaustible resource. For
water is everywhere, and it
doesn't matter whether it's
clean or dirty, salty or fresh.
And here's the truly exciting
part. It's a completely non
polluting resource as well. For
what happens when you burn
hydrogen? You get a waste
product that is... water.

And now Bucky drinks the collected water from the glass
he has placed on the table at the beginning of the
demonstration, and his

STUDENTS

laugh and burst into applause as the CAMERA moves up and
back and finds Eddie, in the back row, a dozen empty rows
between him and the rest of the class. Sketching.

BUCKY (V.0.)
But if we put an end to
pollution, perhaps we may also
put an end to war.

EDDIE'S SKETCH PAD
A new acoustic nozzle takes form under Eddie's pen...

BUCKY (V.0.)
For what is war, but an old idea
derived from the notion that we
must choose between my security
and yours. Why should it be me
or you? Why not both of us?
All of us? With a plentiful
supply of clean energy, we don't
have to choose at all. Truly,
we can all live like...
billionaires.

INT. EDDIE'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

...and as we pull back from the pad, we see we are in
Eddie's basement, crammed with gear, tools, gadgets, and
especially, sound equipment. Eddie puts a prototype
nozzle in place, switches on his amplifier...

BUCKY (V.0.)

(continued)
This glass contains not only
water, but a command, a demand,
that we develop new ways of
thinking, new ways of looking at
the world, new ways of being
human...

...and a low, rumbling HUMMMM emanates from Eddie's
speakers as we CUT TO

EXT. EDDIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT .

A working class neighborhood; the house practically
vibrates on its foundation from the SOUND pouring out of
Eddie's basement, drowning out Bucky's lecture and we CUT
TO

INT. MILL - EDDIE'S WORK AREA - DAY

As Eddie shapes his new nozzle on his lathe, carefully
crafting the nozzle's horn, feeling it with his fingers,
and there is

CHEN

peering over Eddie's shoulder at the work, until Eddie
turns off the lathe. Chen runs his fingers over the

nozzle, checking it out.

CHEN
You have made your model?

EDDIE
Not yet.
CHEN
Lily gonna shoot you. What means
necroplasmic goo?

Eddie removes his safety goggles, looks at Chen blankly.

Chen reads from his Spawn comic:

CHEN
(continued)
"His identity was now forever
lost, exchanged for an unholy
shell of necroplasmic goo."

EDDIE
Sort of tired blood.
(pause)
But clotted.

Chen doesn't get it.

INT. MILL - LAB AREA - DAY

Eddie is slumped inside the water tank, the door open,

installing the acoustic nozzle.

SHANNON
Eddie... can I interrupt?
Eddie looks up.
SHANNON

(continued)
This is Doctor Collier.

COLLIER has a wide grin for Eddie. He is in his fifties,

outgoing and confident, wearing a dark suit.

COLLIER
Hello, Eddie.

EDDIE
Hello.

SHANNON

Eddie's our machinist. He makes
the gadgets the rest of the crew
get to play with. what have you
got here?

EDDIE
A new acoustic nozzle.
SHANNON
We're treating the water with
sound, hoping to make the
hydrogen separation more
economical. We also use a
catalyst for the same purpose.
The two work together. Ah. Dr.
Buchaltz, Dr. Collier...

COLLIER
A great pleasure: I've been
looking forward to meeting you.

SHANNON
Dr. Collier is evaluating
research programs for the Office
of Technology Assessment in
Washington.

COLLIER
So much waste in government
programs, Dr. Bucholtz. I've
been wanting to see how your
program runs on private funding.

BUCKY
Well, stick around. You can see
if it runs at all.
COLLIER
(laughs)
I'd be delighted!
CONSOLE

as the board lights up. Chen leans into the microphone:

CHEN
We have a green board.

WATER TANK

The jets spray water into the tank. Collier watches,
fascinated. We HEAR CHEN:

CHEN (V.0.)
Main power.

Bubbles appear in the tank, near the electrodes.
CHEN (V.0.)
Injector...
Bucky is in his customary deepthink. Shannon rolls his
unlit cigar back and forth between his fingers. The bell
rings and Shannon has to slip Bucky's dark glasses down
from their spot on the top of his head.

CHEN (V.O.)
Laser...

LASER

fires its beams at the mirrors. The water in the tank
begins to roil.

BUCKY
watches... watches... then cues Chen.

CHEN (V.0.)
Cavitation sound waves...

Eddie moves closer to the tank, peers down through the
water at the new nozzle.

CHEN AND LILY
At the console:
CHEN
We have a split. Output ratio
at point three... output ratio
at point four...
Lily crosses to the computer printouts.
CHEN
(continued)
Output ratio at point five...
BLAST FURNACE

ignites. Collier turns his face to the fire.

CHEN (V.0.)
Point six...

ENERGY METERS
The Energy Out meter rises.

CHEN (V.O.)
Point seven...
Still rising. A new note of excitement in Chen's voice:

CHEN (V.0.)
Point eight...

Eddie turns to Bucky, but Bucky is absently shelling
peanuts, watching the water tank.

CHEN (V.0.)
Point nine... and one!

Lily drops the printout, turns, trying to make eye
contact with someone, anyone...

CHEN (V.0.)
One point two... one point
three...

METERS

The Energy In meter falls rapidly now, the Energy out
rising. And suddenly the

BLAST FURNACE

fires into a giant flame, a huge WHOMP that startles the
techies; all eyes on the furnace now:

CHEN (V.0.)
Two... two point one...

Collier and Bucky turn to the fire now, reflected flames
dancing in their dark glasses.

EDDIE
can't contain his glee. He practically runs to the
console, so he can see the meters registering this
amazing output.
CHEN

Two point five... two point

six...
BUCKY

looks up, as if from a dream, peers around the room.

BUCKY
Shut it down.
But in the roar of the furnace, the stunned techies don't
hear him. He shouts:
BUCKY
(continued)
Shut it down!

Chen manages to look up from the meters, realizes that
Bucky is shouting at him.

CHEN
System shut off!

The techies scramble to their tasks; the flame in the
furnace sputters out, the hum of machinery quiets. In
the silence that follows, no one moves. It is Bucky who
finally speaks:

BUCKY
Who brought the marshmallows?

The entire lab erupts in a joyous whoop.
LATER

Champagne and pizza; the techies are in a party mood,
music over the speakers. Lily has a full glass, an
instamatic in her hand.

LILY
Excuse me... Eddie, will you
take a shot of us?

EDDIE
Sure.

She slips her arm around Chen, smiles hugely for the
camera. Eddie shoots.

LILY
(continued)
Let's get everybody. Hey,
everybody! Let's get a shot!
Oh, Mr. Shannon.

She puts her arms around Shannon; she's a little tipsy:

LILY
(continued)
I just... I... thank you. I am
so thrilled!
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Bucky stands in the cold night air, shelling peanuts.
Collier crosses to his side.

COLLIER
Doctor Bucholtz...

BUCKY
Bucky.

COLLIER

Bucky. May I shake your hand?
I'll never forget this day.

BUCKY
Yes, a big day.

COLLIER
How long before you'll be ready
to announce your findings?
Weeks? Months?

Bucky chews thoughtfully.

BUCKY
Well. I suppose it belongs to
the world, now. I think I'll
just send it out on the
internet.

And as Collier registers his surprise, Eddie emerges from
the lab. He calls:

EDDIE
Bucky? They want you for a
picture.

INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT

The techies have gathered in a group, champagne bottles
in hand, silly grins plastered on their faces. Lily is
arranging them for the shot as Eddie sets up the camera
on a makeshift tripod.

LILY
Okay, Mr. Shannon here, Chen,
over there - oh, wait, no...

She's flushed with excitement.
LILY
Oh, it doesn't matter, just

anywhere... Bucky, you have to
be in the middle. Do we have
everybody?

She counts noses. Collier emerges from the shadows:

COLLIER
Why don't I take the picture?
Eddie, you should be in there.

LILY
Oh, right, Eddie... of course.
Forgive me.

As if it never occurred to her. Eddie crosses to Bucky's
side. Bucky turns to him, grins:

BUCKY
Congratulations, Eddie.

EDDIE
Thank you. Congratulations to
you.

And now Lily is at Bucky's side, inserting herself
between Bucky and Eddie:

LILY
Bucky, I'm so proud. Ever since
I was a child, I dreamed of
something like this. I never
imagined it would happen so
soon.

And she slips her arm around him, plants a big kiss on
his cheek as Eddie grins wryly to himself and a

FLASH
from the camera as Collier snaps the picture:
LILY

Oh, wait: I was... You have to
take another one:
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Eddie emerges from the lab, crosses to his bike. Not far
away, we HEAR the grinding of an engine. Eddie stops,
peers through the darkness, then crosses to a car, raps
an the window.

LILY
looks up, puzzled.

LILY
Won't start.

Eddie scans the dashboard.

EDDIE
You're out of gas.

She peers at the gauge.

EDDIE
(continued)
You shouldn't drive, anyway.
Come on, I'll take you home.

LILY AND EDDIE

cross the parking lot. It's cold, and she huddles in her
thin coat.

EDDIE
Where do you live?

LILY
Kimbark and 54th.

She's giddy and a little drunk.

LILY
(continued)
How come I don't know you
better? Are you shy? Or am I
just a snob?

EDDIE
You're a snob.
LILY
I bet you're smart, though.
Shannon wouldn't hire you if you
weren't.

EDDIE
Could've made a mistake.

LILY
Well, even so. You should be
proud. It takes everyone working
together to do a thing like
this. Just being on the team

is... it's a great thing, don't

you think? Even if you're

not... you know what I mean.
EDDIE

I know exactly what you mean.
They're standing at a bus stop.

LILY
Where are you parked?

EDDIE
Back there. I have a
motorcycle.

She turns, looks back into the parking lot. The bus
arrives, Eddie boards. He holds out his hand for her:

EDDIE
(continued)
You'd freeze to death.

She looks at the bus as if she's never seen one before.

INT. MILL - OFFICE AREA - NIGHT
Bucky sits at his computer. Chen pokes his head in:
CHEN
Big excitement today. You think

it happen?

BUCKY
Not so soon.
CHEN
You tell Shannon it happen soon.

Bucky grins.
BUCKY
Sometimes it's better to be

lucky than good.

CHEN
Ah.

A NOISE from another part of the lab.

BUCKY
Someone still here?

CHEN
I think we got rats. They gonna
eat our tubing.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

A bus moves through the late night streets.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

And in the nearly deserted bus, Eddie and Lily sit side
by side.

LILY
What do you carry in your bag?

EDDIE
Burglar's tools.

She laughs.
LILY
Okay, I am a snob. I can't help
it. You probably have a great
novel in there.

He pulls out a fistful of comics. Wrong again.

LILY
Why do you read these things?
EDDIE
I'm corrupting Chen. Making a
real American out of him.

Eddie pulls out his book on Physics, begins reading. She
looks at him oddly.

EDDIE
(continued)
Have you read it?

LILY
Ages ago.

He hands it to her.

EDDIE
Go ahead. Test me. Ask me
anything in there.

Lily eyes him with new interest. She opens the book,
skims a chapter or two.

LILY

(reads: )
Let the potential difference
between the inner shell of a Van
de Graaff accelerator and the
point at which charges are
sprayed onto the moving
belt be 3.40 MV. If the belt
transfers charge to the shell at
the rate of 2.80 mO0C/5, what
minimum power must be provided
to drive the belt?

Pause as Eddie considers the question. Then:

EDDIE
Ask me something else.
(pause)
Well come on, you picked the
hardest chapter.

INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT
Chen is on his hands and knees, baiting a rat trap with

cheese. He delicately slides the trap under a jutting
corner...
ANGLE - CHEN

...and we watch him as if through the eyes of an observer
as

CHEN

takes another trap and baits it, carefully sets it,
creeps toward us, slides the trap slowly, slowly... and a
sudden BANG... startles Chen and sends

BUCKY
to the doorway, peering into the shadowy lab:

BUCKY
Chen?

Chen looks up sheepishly: he's accidentally sprung the
trap. When he speaks, it's in his native Chinese:

CHEN
(untranslated)
Cocksucker.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Eddie is reading from the physics text, using his hands
to illustrate the problem:

EDDIE
See, you have this tuning fork
attached to a stretched wire,
and it generates transverse
waves. The vibration of the
fork is perpendicular to the
wire. Its frequency is 400 Hz
and the amplitude of its
oscillation is 0.50 mm...

He turns to Lily, who's out like a light, snoring gently
against his shoulder. Eddie puts the book away, peers
out the window.

EDDIE
(continued)
Hey. This is us.
EXT. LILY'S STREET - NIGHT

Eddie half carries Lily up the stairs to her apartment.
She's leaning into him, speaking into his neck.

LILY
Big key for this one. Little
key inside.

EDDIE
Can you stand up while I do
this?

LILY

No problema.

He lets her go to fiddle with the key, has to grab her as
she sags to her knees...

LILY
(continued)
Little problema.

INT. LILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

Eddie helps Lily inside.

EDDIE
Bedroom?

She points.

LILY
Do you think I'm too serious?

EDDIE
Not right now.

LILY
You understand why we need the
specs, don't you?

EDDIE
Yes.

He drops her gently onto the bed. Swings her feet up.
Slips her shoes off.

LILY
Poor Lily. She's too serious.
EDDIE

Who says?

LILY
Everybody. Never finda
husband.

He can't help noticing the half dozen or so framed
DIPLOMAS

not hung but propped modestly on an overflowing book
shelf: a BA from South Africa, graduate degrees from
schools in London, Paris, science awards from Sydney, the
Planck Institute. She's a heavy hitter.

EDDIE
You've been around.

But she's already asleep, her arms curled around her
pillow for comfort.

INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT

Chen has baited his last trap, is down on his hands and
knees, sliding it carefully under some tubing. He
pushes, pushes, can't quite get it where he wants it, has
to slide it through a small opening without the damn
thing going off... pushes ever so gently... ah. That's
it.

He's gotten his hands and clothes dirty from trying to
position the trap. Still on his knees, he dusts himself
off, then rises slowly, looks up...

Something he sees startles the hell out of him.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Eddie is back on the bus. Peering out the window,
thinking about Lily. Smiling.

EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

The bus pulls up and Eddie alights, heads for his bike
parked in the lot.
BIKE

Eddie hops on, fires it up, pulls slowly past the
entrance to the mill lab...

DOOR

is slightly open, lights shining dimly from the inside.
Eddie stops. Considers for a moment.

Then he turns the bike off. He crosses to the door,
enters.
INT. MILL - NIGHT

Eddie enters. Listens for a beat; then says, under his
breath:

EDDIE
Anybody home?

He crosses to the office area, sees a light shining from
the back - Bucky's office. He crosses.

And he pokes his head into

BUCKY'S OFFICE

where Bucky's feet are visible, propped on the computer
stand behind his desk, his head obscured by the high back

of the chair in which he sits.

EDDIE
Bucky?

No answer. Bucky's computer is on, the screen casting a
dim, green glow into the small office.

Eddie repeats:

EDDIE
(continued)
Bucky? You awake?

Still no answer. Eddie crosses to the chair, and what he
sees hits him like a hard blow to his chest, taking his
breath away:...
BUCKY

is slumped in the chair, his face blue, a plastic bag
tied tightly over his head and plastered to his skin with
his last inhalation of breath.

EDDIE
Oh, my god: Oh, Jesus...
He yanks the bag off Bucky's head with such force that
Bucky's inert body falls from the chair onto the floor.

EDDIE
(continued)
Oh, Jesus, Bucky!

He's down on the floor with Bucky, holding the old man's
head back, breathing into his mouth.

And then he begins pumping Bucky's chest.

EDDIE
(continued)
Oh, Bucky, come on... come on...

He breathes into his mouth again, pumps his chest, but
it's useless.

EDDIE
(continued)
Oh, shit, oh shit!

He scrambles up, searches wildly for a phone, lifts the
receiver: the line is dead. The cord dangles loosely to
the floor.

Eddie darts out of the room into the

HALL

walking quickly to another office, tries the phone there:
the cord is cut.

He stands for a moment, trying to make sense of this,
then his face darkens. He sniffs... He raises his head,
sniffs again...

LAB AREA
Eddie races in: a soft HISSING SOUND coming from

somewhere in the lab. He moves into the lab searching
for it's source, stops suddenly:
HYDROGEN STORAGE TANK...

is spilling hydrogen into the lab, it's valve wide open.
Eddie turns, almost stumbles, past an oxygen storage tank
nearby:

OXYGEN STORAGE TANK

is also hissing, sending a lethal mixture into the lab.
Eddie tries to turn the valve shut but it spins uselessly
under his hand.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

An unmarked van, bland, white, pulls to a stop an the
bridge. The door on the driver's side opens and a pair of
booted feet emerge into the night. In the distance, we
can see the hulking mill in the dim light.

INT. MILL - LAB AREA - NIGHT

Eddie is frozen with fear. The HISSING SOUND is louder
now, but perhaps it is just in Eddie's brain. Slowly, he
begins making his way out of the lab...

EXT. MILL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

...and once outside, he runs. He grabs the bike, fearful
of starting it so near the lab, he pushes it, sweating,
until he is willing to gamble. He lets out the clutch
and the EXHAUST sputters with a blue flame and EDDIE
cringes, expecting an explosion, but there is none. He
slips into low gear, speeds on a straight away, tearing
through the night as we CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

as the booted figure we saw earlier slides the panel door
open, reaches for a small detonator resting on the rear
seat. He holds the detonator in both hands as

EDDIE

puts his head down and roars away and
THE DETONATOR
is plunged down. From our view on the bridge...
THE MILL

erupts in a violent explosion that suggests a mighty
bomb, sending huge pieces of debris into the air anda

ROLLING SHOCK WAVE:

that threatens to overtake Eddie on his bike, and finally
does, sending him careening into the brush beside the
road as

PIECES OF THE MILL

begin to descend like shrapnel on the neighborhood,
raining destruction from the winter night sky...

A BOILER

crashing through the roof of an American Legion Hall...
LILY'S CAR

rolling like tumbleweed across the parking lot...

ROW OF HOUSES

ignited by flaming shards landing on the peaked roofs,
and WE CUT TO

A TELEPHONE

ringing in the night once, twice, a hand reaches for it,
we are in

INT. SHANNON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

as Shannon picks up the phone and says, groggily:

SHANNON
Yes...

We can HEAR a torrent of words spoken so loudly, so
rapidly, coming through the phone, it almost lifts
Shannon to a sitting position.
SHANNON
(continued)
... Eddie?

EXT. MILL SITE - EARLY MORNING

Utter devastation: the mill has been leveled, a shroud
of thick smoke diffusing the weak winter light and giving
an other worldly sense to the scene. Fire department
investigators comb the wreckage, as police maintain the
barricades set up to keep the crowds of curious away. A
television newsreporter (RITA BLISS) is doing a standup,
with the smoking ruins in the background:

RITA
The incredible devastation from
last night's blast is only now
becoming apparent, and has left
workers at this scene with a
sense of utter disbelief.
Just what was going on here and
what might have caused the -
powerful explosion is still not
clear, although according to
sources at the university, the
mill had been converted into a
site for the experimental
production of hydrogen fuel. It
was not, these sources say,
supposed to be dangerous.
But tell that to this once
peaceful neighborhood whose
quiet was shattered last night.
And tell that to the dozens of
local, state and federal
Investigators who have descended
on this spot, trying to make
sense from the bits and pieces
of what is left...

AGENT RAYMOND FORD

a tall, soft spoken man with a hint of New York Irish in
his speech moves through the gloom, led by an aide, to a
spot where Eddie and Shannon stand.

AIDE
This is agent Raymond Ford from the FBI, Mr. Shannon, who
runs the Franklin Foundation...
FORD
Mr. Shannon.

AIDE
...and Mr. Kopek.

FORD
Hello.

They shake hands.

FORD
(continued)
You were the one who was here
last night?

EDDIE
We were all here. But yeah, I
came back later.

FORD
And when you got here, Dr.
Bucholtz was dead?

EDDIE
Yes.

FORD
How do you know he was dead,
son?

EDDIE

He had a plastic bag over his
head. He was blue...

FORD
Could he have done it himself?

Eddie looks offended by the question:

EDDIE
No. He wouldn't have.

FORD

(to his Aide: )

Okay, I want everyone who worked
at the lab in my office. Mr.
Shannon, if you don't mind, I'd
like to have you, too. I want a
search of Dr. Bucholtz' office
at the University. I want a
search of Mr. Shannon's
foundation... Mr. Shannon, I
hope you'll make this easy for
us...

As he begins to move off, the newsreporter presses him:

RITA
Excuse me... Mr. Ford, may I ask
a few questions...

FORD
No, Ma'am.

He moves quickly, but she keeps up:

RITA
Do you have any leads?

FORD
No, Ma'am.

RITA
Can you tell us why the FBI is
involved?

FORD
Ma'am, we just had eight city
blocks disappear. That's why
we're involved.

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY

A half dozen TV news trucks are parked nearby as a group

of newsmen mill about, waiting for word.

INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - FBI OFFICES - HALLWAY - DAY

A madhouse: agents moving back and forth as, inside

various offices and cubicles we see the techies and

scientists from the lab being interviewed. We FOLLOW a

secretary into

FORD'S OFFICE

where Ford and other agents are interviewing Shannon:
SHANNON

They were scientists. Highly
trained, experts in their field.
Some technical assistants,
graduate students, mostly...

FORD
Suppose you start from the
beginning. How many altogether?

SHANNON
I'd have to think...

SECOND OFFICE
A large room where Eddie, Lily and a half dozen techies
from the lab are undergoing interrogation by a group of

agents.

EDDIE
I'd come back for my bike.

AGENT GRAY
You'd taken Miss Naughton home?

EDDIE
Yes.

AGENT GRAY
Why?

EDDIE

She couldn't get her car
started. She'd had a little bit
to drink.

AGENT GRAY
You have a relationship with
Miss Naughton?

EDDIE
No. She's a physicist.

A blank look from the agent.

EDDIE
(continued)
I'm a machinist.

He casts an eye across the room at Lily, answering
another agent's question. She seems stunned, red eyed
from lack of sleep.
LILY
I was hired by Dr. Chen.

AGENT MASTERS
Who is he?

LILY
He was Dr. Bucholtz's project
manager.

AGENT MASTERS
Where is he now?

LILY
He's home, I'd imagine.

AGENT MASTERS
You have a number for him?

LILY
Yes.

AGENT MASTERS
Let's get him in here. why did
he hire you?

LILY
Because I'm smart. And I speak
Chinese.
AND WE CUT TO:
FORDS OFFICE
SHANNON

I found Dr. Chen in China. He'd
run into trouble with the
Chinese authorities. I helped
arrange for him to come here.

FORD
What sort of trouble?

SHANNON
He was involved in the pro
democracy movement. Not a good
thing to be, in China.

FORD
And what about this Kopek guy?
SHANNON
What about him?

FORD
Is he one of your scientists?

SHANNON
No. But he's good at what he
does.

FORD

What do you know about him?

SHANNON
I've known him for a long time.
Dad was a plumber, and thena
union official. He had a union
scholarship to college, but he
had to leave school...

FORD
Why?

SHANNON
(shrugs: )
I think he was having problems.
Spent a couple years in the
army. I ran into him again
working in a machine shop. He
was good and I hired him.

AND WE CUT TO:

INT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION OFFICES - DAY
A pair of agents are with Shannon's worried secretary:

AGENT SCHMIDT
These are the entire foundation
offices?.

SECRETARY
In Chicago, yes. We have other
offices in Washington.

AGENT SCHMIDT
And the personnel at the lab
were technically employees of
the foundation?
SECRETARY
That's right.

AGENT SCHMIDT
Can you show us the personnel
files?

SECRETARY
They're over here. That drawer.

INT. CHEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door opens and two FBI agents enter, followed by the
building superintendent, who has a key to the door. The
agents split up, and we follow one into the

KITCHEN

where yesterday's dishes remain in the sink, unwashed.
The super appears in the kitchen doorway:

AGENT GRAY
When's the last time you saw
him?

SUPER
Yesterday.

AGENT GRAY
What time?

SUPER
He go to work same time,
everyday. Little Chinese guy.
Always said hello.
FORDS OFFICE

Ford's phone rings. Ford picks up:

FORD
Ford... yeah. Okay. Find him.

He hangs up, turns to Shannon.
FORD

(continued)
Your Doctor Chen is missing.
Shannon can't fathom this; he holds Ford's stare with his
own, his face clouding in confusion.

EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - EVENING

Eddie emerges, is immediately engulfed in a shouting mob
of reporters:

REPORTERS
Can you tell us what's going on
up there?... Excuse me, sir...
Do they have any suspects?...
Was it a bomb?... Who are they
talking to?

EDDIE
I don't know anything. I'm
sorry.

He makes his way through the mob, but they've already
spotted someone else coming out of the door: it's

LILY
nearly overwhelmed as the horde descends an her:

REPORTERS
Miss, would you speak to us?...
Pardon me, who are you?...
What's happening up there?...Was
this a terrorist attack?

LILY
I don't know... Please, let me
through...

REPORTERS
Do you work at the lab?...
What's your name?... Is Dr.
Bucholtz dead?... How many were
killed?

LILY

I don't know. I don't know
anything, please...

She makes it to the curb, looks up for a cab, finds Eddie
standing on the steps of a bus:
EDDIE
Need a ride?

The mob of microphones and cameras stalks her. It only
takes her a split second to consider.

She hops on the bus as it pulls away, leaving a sea of
cameras and microphones in its wake.

AND WE CUT TO:
SHOT - TELEVISION SET

A press conference, with Ford at the microphone, backed
up by Chicago police and a room jammed with reporters.

FORD
We have not ruled out an
accident, but our investigation
is proceeding on the assumption
that the laboratory was
sabotaged...

REPORTER
By whom?

FORD
We can't say at this point.

RITA BLISS
Mr. Ford, we have reports that
Dr. Bucholtz was killed in the
explosion...

FORD
We have a similar report. I
don't want to say too much about

that...

RITA BLISS
Can you tell us if he's presumed
dead?

The SOUND is abruptly MUTED. We are in
INT. SHANNON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

as Shannon puts the remote control down, picks up his
phone, dials. We HEAR the voice answering:
VOICE
Dr. Collier's office...

SHANNON
It's Tony Shannon for Dr.
Collier.

VOICE
I'm sorry... Dr. Collier is en
route from Chicago.

SHANNON
Have him call me when he gets
in.

He hangs up, sinks deeper into his couch.
the remote, points it at the set:

ANOTHER TELEVISION SET
as the press conference continues:

FORD
We're looking for one of the
employees at the lab, Dr. Lu
Chen...

Chen's picture appears on screen; we're in

INT. LILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

as Lily and Eddie slump with exhaustion in
set, steaming coffee cups in their hands.

FORD
(continued)
We'd appreciate help from anyone
who might know of his
whereabouts...

REPORTER
Is he a suspect?

FORD
No. Not at this time. we're
simply concerned with his well
being...

Lily snaps the TV off.

He picks up

front of the
LILY
They think he did it.

She rises, crosses to the kitchen, enters. Eddie
follows:

KITCHEN
Lily is making herself busy with the dishes.

EDDIE
Why would he do it?

LILY
He wouldn't. But he looks
different and he talks different
and they're going to think he
did it.

EDDIE
Where do you think he is?

LILY
I don't know where he is.
(pause: something
occurs to her:)
You don't think he did it...

EDDIE
No. I'm not saying that...

LILY
Well what are you saying?

EDDIE
I'm just wondering where he
is...

LILY

...because I don't know you very
well. I've only been here for
six months. I don't know anyone
very well. My family isa
million miles away... and I'm
scared.

Tears start down her cheeks. She tries to wipe them
away, angrily throws the sponge into the sink, pushes
past him.
LILY
(continued)
I think you better go.
And she disappears into her bedroom, closing the door
behind her.
EXT. STREET - NEWSSTAND - MORNING

A bundle of papers is ripped open by a news dealer.
Screaming headlines:

BLAST MYSTERY DEEPENS
Noted Professor Was Dead Before Explosion
And just below the fold, a picture of Chen:

WHERE IS LU CHEN?

INT. LILY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

The phone RINGS once, twice... automatically answers,
begins spitting out a fax message.

LILY

emerges from her bedroom, groggy with sleep, peers down
at the incoming

FAX

...it's in Chinese. Some movement across the room
catches her eye, startles her:

It's Eddie, staring at her bleary eyed, from the couch
where he's been sleeping.

LILY
What are you doing here?

EDDIE
I thought you shouldn't be
alone.
INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - FORD'S OFFICE - DAY

An agent scurries down the hall, carrying a folder in his
hands, enters Ford's office.

AGENT SCHMIDT
I think you better look at this.

Ford is on the phone, looks like he's just swallowed bad
food. He holds his hand up:

FORD
That's all you have?... How
reliable is it?... Thanks. You

better get me some paper on it.

He hangs up, looks at the folder the agent has opened an
his desk.

AGENT SCHMIDT
It's Kopek's file.

FORD
What about it?

AGENT SCHMIDT
Had to leave college for
disciplinary reasons.

Ford looks up into the agent's eyes:

AGENT SCHMIDT

(continued)
Broke into a science lab after
hours. Apparently doing some
sort of experiment. He blew the
hell out of the lab. I mean,
maybe this is a coincidence, but
Lord A'mighty...

FORD
I want his house searched. Get
hold of anybody who knows him,
family, friends. Let's find out
about this guy. Same with Lily
Naughton. Pick ‘em both up.
AGENT SCHMIDT
Lily Naughton?
A nod to the phone:

FORD
Central Intelligence has been
tracking this Chen guy for
months. They think he's in
China.

AGENT SCHMIDT
China:

FORD
Reported on a plane out of
Vancouver yesterday.

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY

Lily and Eddie on a bench beside the river; Lily is
studying the fax; she seems stunned, in shock:

LILY
This is a lie...

EDDIE
What do you mean?

LILY
It has Chen's name on it, but
it's not from Chen.

EDDIE
How do you know?

LILY
It uses a vernacular he couldn't
speak.

EDDIE

What does it say?

LILY
It says I should join him. It
says the information is in safe
hands.

EDDIE
Join him where?

LILY
In China.
She folds the fax, puts it in her pocket. She can barely

say the words:
LILY

(continued)
I'm being framed.

Silence as Eddie tries to make sense of this. She turns
to him.

LILY
(continued)
Look, you don't know me. There's
no reason for you to believe
me...

EDDIE
I do believe you.

LILY
...I don't know anything about
this. This isn't Chen... I
don't know who sent this...

She rises, starts walking away, quickly.

EDDIE
(continued)
Lily:

LILY
Don't follow me: Please don't
follow me.

EDDIE
Lily, I believe you:

She wheels, continues on, practically running. Eddie has
to sprint after her.

EDDIE
(continued)
Lily! wait...

He catches her, turns her to him, she's quaking with
fear:
INT.

EDDIE
(continued)
Lily, you have to trust
somebody. It might as well be
me.

FRANKLIN FOUNDATION OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ford and another agent have Shannon under fire:

FORD
You knew this kid had been
thrown out of school?

SHANNON
He resigned.

FORD
Under pressure, wouldn't you
say?

SHANNON
There was some pressure, yeah.

FORD
Kid practically blows down a
science building...

SHANNON
It was an interesting
experiment. It might have
worked.

FORD
How did you know about it?

SHANNON
I was on the science faculty at
the time.

FORD
Why didn't you tell us about it
yesterday?

SHANNON
I didn't think it was relevant.

FORD
You don't see some small
connection here?
SHANNON
No.

FORD
Mr. Shannon, I got something
here that doesn't smell right.
I got a big bang in the middle
of the night. I got a professor
dead. CIA tells me Chen might
be involved in espionage. This
Kopek guy has a past that makes
me nervous. All the threads run
right back to you...

INT. EDDIE'S HOUSE - WORKSHOP - DAY

Cons poke through the workshop, opening drawers, peering
into containers. Agent Schmidt is overseeing the work:

AGENT SCHMIDT
Any explosives, any fire
accelerants, anything at all...
be creative...

A VOICE comes from upstairs:

VOICE (0.S.)
Jim... you better get up here.

Schmidt climbs the stairs...

EDDIE'S BEDROOM

Schmidt enters with Agent Gray; a couple of cops are in
the bedroom, pulling apart the bedding, the drawers in
Eddie's bureau.

AGENT SCHMIDT
What've you got?

Gray leads him to a small black bag, which they've taken
from Eddie's closet. He hoists the bag onto the bed,
opens it:
BAG
stuffed with money.
AGENT SCHMIDT
Where'd you find it?
AGENT GRAY
Back of the closet. Under a
pile of old clothes.

AGENT SCHMIDT
How much?

Gray stands scratching his beard, estimating...

INT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The secretary opens the door, pokes her head in:

SECRETARY
Mr. Ford? A call for you.

Ford picks up the phone:

FORD
Ford...
(pause)
Okay. I want him. Get every
fucking cop in the city.
He hangs up, turns to Shannon:

FORD
(continued)
You know anybody who'd put fifty
thousand dollars in a black bag
and give it to your Mr. Kopek?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Shannon drives through rush hour traffic...

EXT. SHANNON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

...and pulls into the underground parking facility as
ACROSS THE STREET

an unmarked city car pulls into a parking space and

stops. The driver watches as Shannon's car disappears
into the garage...
INT. SHANNON'S APARTMENT HUILDING - PARKING GARAGE -
NIGHT

Shannon parks his car in his usual spot, emerges, crosses
toward the elevator. It's dark and a little spooky in
the garage. Shannon hears FOOTSTEPS coming from
somewhere - the echoes confuse him. He stops, turns: no
one behind him. He continues, is startled by two figures
stepping from behind a pillar; it's

EDDIE AND LILY
waiting for him.

EDDIE
Tony we need some help.
Someone's trying to frame Lily.

SHANNON
What do you mean?

EDDIE
She got a fax, supposedly from
Chen. It's not from Chen. It
makes her look like she's
involved in this...

SHANNON
What do you know about the bag,
Eddie?

EDDIE
What bag?

SHANNON
The cops found one in your
closet. Stuffed with cash.

Now it's Eddie's turn to be shocked:

EDDIE
I don't know anything about it.

SHANNON
Think, Eddie! Could someone
have left it there? Was it
someone else's?
EDDIE
No. No one's been in my
place... I don't know anything
about a bag:

LILY
Oh, Jesus: what's happening:

Shannon lets out a breath:

SHANNON
Alright, listen. I believe you.
I believe you both. I don't
know what's happening, but I'm
going to find out. I know some
people who might know the
answer. But for now, you're
both in danger. They've got
half the police in Chicago
looking for you. Do you have
someplace to go?

EDDIE
I have friends...

SHANNON
No good. They'll know your
friends. How about you, Lily?

LILY
Not here.

SHANNON
Friends here are no good. How
about someplace else?

She thinks:

LILY
Yes.

SHANNON
Can you get there? How much
money do you have?

He's already reaching for his wallet.

SHANNON
(continued)
Give me some time. Then call
me, I'm going to do what I can.
There's a car parked outside, a
cop. He's following me. Wait
five minutes before you go.

He turns to go, then stops:
SHANNON
(continued )

Be careful. We're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

INT. LILY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
...as cops' rifle through Lily's things. In the silence,
her phone RINGS, once, twice. The cops stop, listen:
Lily's answering machine picks up, but instead of a voice
on the other end, the machine begins printing a fax.
One, of the cops walks over, stares at the incoming
message:
CoP
What the hell is this? It's
Chinese...

EXT. SHANNON'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Shannon emerges; hurries away, pulling his coat up around
his face as if trying to hide.

in the unmarked car opposite, watching. He gets out,
follows Shannon at a discreet distance.

EDDIE AND LILY.

watch as the cop follows Shannon. Then they move quickly
on foot out of the garage and down the block in the
opposite direction.

INT. DRUG STORE - NIGHT

Shannon enters, picks up a paper, scans the headlines:
SEEK TWO IN SOUTHSIDE BLAST

Pictures of Eddie and Lily on the front page. Shannon
steps into a phone booth, dials. Waits.
SHANNON
Dr. Collier, please... It's Tony
Shannon.

VOICE (V.O.)
One moment.

COLLIER (V.O.)
Hello.

SHANNON
What the fuck is going on?

INT. COLLIER'S WASHINGTON OFFICE - NIGHT
Collier sits in the semi darkness behind a huge desk.

COLLIER
You tell me. You've got
termites in your house. I think
you better get back here.

SHANNON (V.O.)

Are you leaving it up to me?
COLLIER

No.

INT. BAR - NIGHT
Lily is on the payphone.

LILY
Eight fifteen... thank you.

She hangs up. She crosses to Eddie at the bar, sits
beside him.
LILY
(continued)
There's an 8:15 to Madison.

He speaks without looking at her:
EDDIE
Meet you there. Get out of

here.

He rises, heads to the men's room. She watches him,
uncomprehending, until she sees a guy down the bar with
the newspaper, casually studying the two of them, looking
at the pictures on the front page. He turns, watches as
Eddie passes to the men's room. When he turns back to
Lily, she's already gone.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

Lily hails a cab, enters.

INT. CAB - NIGHT

LILY
Union Station.

CABBIE
Yes, Ma'am.

He pulls away.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Eddie emerges from the men's room, moves past the man
with the paper, exits. The man stuffs his paper under
his arm, follows Eddie to the door.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

The man with the paper watches as Eddie melts into the
crowd on the street. He seems unsure, is about to re-

enter the bar, when a police car passes slowly.

MAN WITH PAPER
Hey:

He flags the car down, crosses, sticks his head in the
window and says something to the cop driving.

EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT

Eddie moves through the crowd. It's rush hour and the
sidewalks are jammed with people buttoned up against the

icy blast. A sudden NOISE startles him and we CUT To a

SQUAD CAR
southbound on the Avenue making a screaming U-turn across
six lanes of traffic, and sliding to a halt at the curb.
Two cops lump out and scan the scene.

Eddie tries to disappear into the crowd.
COPS

have spotted him. Eddie breaks into a run, but the
sidewalk is too crowded. He darts into the street,
running south into oncoming traffic, dodging taxis like a
broken field runner. The cops are in pursuit, chasing
him down the middle of the street.

In the distance are the sounds of APPROACHING SIRENS.

Then he hears another noise - the deep bellow of a SHIP'S
HORN, and the CLANG CLANG of the traffic barricades
coming down on the bridge ahead.

He turns: there are squad cars inbound on both side
streets. He's cut off. No choice but to make for the
bridge.

THE BRIDGE

is already in motion as Eddie slides under the crossing
arm and leaps onto the deck. One of the pursuing cops is
right behind him.

Eddie scrambles up the tilting incline, slipping and
sliding on the icy surface. The cop isn't doing any
better. Desperately, Eddie works his way over to the
side rail. He uses it like a ladder to claw his way up.

The cop is in reach. He grabs for Eddie - manages a grip
an Eddie's shoe!

cop

For just the briefest moment, the cop and Eddie hang
together - their eyes meet - and in the cop's agonized
expression we can see that he's slipping... slipping...
until his grip releases and he crashes onto the sidewalk
below.

INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

The BRIDGE TENDER moves to the window. He can't believe
his eyes. There's a man climbing up the side rail.
The Tender lunges for the brake lever...

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Eddie makes it to the lip of the rising bascule - now
eight stories above the pavement - just as it shudders to
a halt.

It nearly shakes him loose. Clinging by his fingers, he
grips the steel edge of the spar...

He looks down and sees a half dozen cops, guns drawn,
shouting at him from the pavement below.

INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
Two cops come pounding up the steps, enter the tower.

SERGEANT
How do we get him down?

TENDER
I dunno. We move it and well
shake him loose...

SERGEANT
Alright, don't move it.
(into his radio: )
Where the hell's the goddam
boat?

TENDER
Who is he?

SECOND COP
The guy who blew up the lab.

TENDER
Jesus!

He peers out at Eddie. And WE CUT TO:
EDDIE
clinging to the top of the span, barely able to hold an

in the icy wind. As he looks up, he finds himself
staring into the
WINDOWS

of the skyscrapers bordering Michigan Avenue, now filling
with spectators who suddenly find themselves with front
row seats for the unexpected drama, their faces awash in
the red and blue lights from the police and emergency
vehicles below.

Eddie manages a toe-hold on the side rail. With a final
effort, he inches up on top of the bridge. He looks down:

COPS

have gathered on Michigan Avenue. On the other side of
the raised roadway is the open mouth of the lower level -
and the icy river, 100 feet below. And in the window,
nearly at his own level, a SECRETARY holds a message she
has scrawled:

A sudden blinding light from below, and WE CUT TO:
STREET
where a TV crew has set up for business. Behind them, a
crowd gathers, faces turned upward like a field of
sunflowers.
EXT. CHICAGO RIVER - NIGHT
A police boat slows to maneuvering speed as it approaches
the open span. On the afterdeck, one OFFICER talks into
his radio as two other men adjust their fins and wet
suits.
OFFICER
Marine three-five. We got two
divers on deck.

INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

SERGEANT
Copy, three-five.

He looks up at Eddie, brilliantly lit against the black:
SERGEANT
(continued)
Alright, bring him down.
Slowly.

The tender moves to his machinery.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

The bridge shudders. Eddie is thrown off balance.

EXT. MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT

AS cops and the TV crew look on, Eddie teeters, then
disappears. A horrified GASP from the crowd as

EDDIE

falling, grabs a pipe running from the upper to the lower
level and slides down it like a fireman.

COPS

on Michigan Avenue scatter to the side rails to see if he
hit the water.

BRIDGE

Eddie lands on the lower level footbridge. He loses his
footing and begins to slide down the steep incline -
straight for the grinding gears of the bridge mechanism.
Desperately clawing at the side rail, he tries to catch
himself before he's caught in the churning gears. But he
can't hang on.

INT. BRIDGE MACHINERY ROOM - NIGHT

The immense gears interlock, meshing together like the
workings of a giant clock. It looks like time has run
out as Eddie falls into the machinery...

INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

The Tender grabs the brake lever...
INT. BRIDGE MACHINERY ROOM - NIGHT

...and the bridge shudders to a halt. Several cops rush
into the concrete chamber that houses the bridge
mechanism. Shining their lights into the gears, they
search for Eddie - but there's no sign of him. The cops
are mystified.

INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
Lily enters, crosses toward the ticket booths:

LILY
The eight fifteen to Madison.

TICKET AGENT
How many?

LILY
One.

Lily turns, sees a pair of cops strolling through the
station, scanning the crowds. She peers up at the clock:

CLOCK

It's a few minutes past eight. She turns back to the
ticket agent.

LILY
(continued)
You better make that two..

EXT. BRIDGE COUNTERWEIGHT - NIGHT

The shadows of the bridge structure work in Eddie's favor
as he inches along a beam set into the face of the
gigantic concrete counterweight. Below him - one false
step away - is the empty blackness of the dry well.

On the other side, cops are shouting at each other. As
their flashlights play across him, he sucks himself into
the channel of an I-Beam, and tries not to look down.

INT. BRIDGE CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

Ford comes pounding up the steps, joining the Tender and
the two cops.
FORD
(showing his badge)
FBI, Sergeant. Where is he?

SERGEANT
Damned if I know.

FORD
Let's get the bridge down and
find him.

TENDER
If he's down there in the
machinery, we'll squash him like

a bug.
FORD

What do you suggest?
TENDER

I only work here.
FORD

Take it down.

INT. BRIDGE SUPERSTRUCTURE - NIGHT

Wedged between two steel beams, Eddie is sweating bullets
as the cops sweep the area around him.

Suddenly, the ALARM BELLS sound and the WHIRR and GRIND
of machinery starts again. The bridge is moving.

Wide eyed, Eddie realizes that the two beams he's
sandwiched between are closing in on him.

A COP is right beside him, nearly close enough to touch.
Eddie is trapped. At last, the cop moves on and Eddie
eases clear at the last second.

He looks up. There is a narrow gap between the roadway
and the bridge but it's closing fast.

He makes a leap - catches the edge of the bridge - and
slithers through the opening as it closes like a
ponderous guillotine.
EXT. BRIDGE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

Emerging like a gopher onto the lower level roadway,
Eddie slides under the first car in line.

He catches his breath and looks around. There are cops
all over the place, but none right on top of him. Moving
on knees and elbows, he slithers on down the line under
the next car and the next.

INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

Lily steals another nervous glance at the clock: eight
ten. Two cops are approaching. She turns to an OLD
WOMAN nearby, slips her arm through the woman's arm:

LILY
Do you mind walking me to my
train? I get so nervous when I
have to travel.

OLD WOMAN
Aw, nothin' to it. Come on.
Where we goin'?

LILY
Oh, thank you. I'm sucha
goose.

She buries her face in the woman's shoulder and moves
past the cops.

EXT. LOWER.MICHIGAN AVENUE - NIGHT

The bridge is being sealed off and the cops are
frantically clearing the area.

A city salt truck idling in line is finally able to back
up:

CoP
Okay, move it, move it:

The driver slams it in gear and as it trundles past, we
see the tarp on top of the load has an extra hump. And
it's alive.
INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
The clock hand leaps to eight fifteen. We HEAR the
announcer:

ANNOUNCER
Final call for the eight fifteen
to Madison.
EDDIE

comes running into the station, moving through the crowd,
nearly knocking down a red cap with a load of luggage as

THE TRAIN
begins to move, silently...

EDDIE
Where's the train to Madison?

REDCAP
Track nine, but you too late.
Go ahead, run.

Eddie runs.

Ahead, chatting casually, watching the train, are the two
cops. No way for Eddie to make it past them.

The train is gathering speed.
Eddie slows, begins walking, casually, trying to hide his
face. It's agonizing. The train is simply outgaining

him, pulling away. The cops scan the platform area...

Eddie stops. Nothing to do now but watch the train
depart. It is moving further away, out of reach.

And suddenly, the train stops, brakes hissing, the cars
jouncing together noisily. The cops are on the alert.
They hurry to the train just as the

CONDUCTOR

alights onto the platform, turns, and helps the old woman
off the train.

CoP
What's the trouble?
CONDUCTOR
Had the wrong train. St. Louis
is track seven, Ma'am.

And the cops watch as the old woman makes her way across
the platform. The spot where Eddie was standing is now
vacant.

INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

Lily sits alone, staring at the two tickets in her hand
as the conductor makes his way down the aisle toward her.

There is a voice behind her. It's Eddie:

EDDIE
This seat taken?

He sits beside her.

EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT

The train plows through the night landscape. And WE CUT
TO:

EXT. MADISON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

A taxi swings around in a wide arc, illuminating the
Madison sign in it's beams, then pulls away.

EXT. MADISON ROAD - NIGHT

The taxi approaches an oddly shaped building, pulls up in
front and stops, its lights illuminating a sign saying
"Observatory". Eddie and Lily emerge, cross to the
building and enter.

INT. MADISON OHSERVATORY - HALL - NIGHT

Hall lights are on, but most of the offices are dark.
Eddie and Lily move down the hallway, come upon the night
WATCHMAN, dozing at his desk.

LILY
Excuse me... I'm looking for
Maggie Horner.
He blinks awake.

WATCHMAN
Might try the door down at the
end of the hall, around the
corner.

He points. Watches as Eddie and Lily follow his
directions. Then he settles back in his chair and closes
his eyes again.

INT. OBSERVATORY ROOM - NIGHT

Eddie and Lily enter. A huge telescope dominates the
room, at the base of which, a single seat is occupied by
a woman (MAGGIE) in her late twenties, wearing bib
overalls, her eye glued to the telescope sight.

LILY
Maggie?

MAGGIE
Hold on.

She makes notes on a board she holds on her lap.

LILY
Maggie...

Maggie finally turns, annoyed, is startled to see Lily:

MAGGIE
Jesus H. Christ!

The board slips to the floor. She leaps from the seat,
throws her arms around Lily.

MAGGIE
(continued)
How did you get here?

LILY
We took the train. Maggie, this
is Eddie.

Maggie looks from one to the other.
MAGGIE

It's bullshit, isn't it. The
whole thing. You guys have
nothing to do with what's going
on.

LILY
Nothing at all.

MAGGIE
I knew it. You're being framed.

LILY
Oh, Maggie, thank god for you.

MAGGIE
Everybody gets framed. Oswald,
the Rosenbergs, Alger Hiss, it's
nothing to be ashamed of.

LILY
We're not ashamed.

MAGGIE
You watch, they're gonna catch
the unabomber. Some poor
sonofabitch.
I've been calling you all
night...

Eddie interrupts:

EDDIE
Calling where?

MAGGIE
Calling Lily...

EDDIE
Did you leave your name? On the
machine?
MAGGIE
Well, yeah... my name, my
number... why?
She can tell from the look on their faces she's done
something wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.

EXT. DULLES AIRPORT - NIGHT

A jetliner lands. WE CUT TO:
INT. DULLES AIRPORT - NIGHT

AS passengers emerge through the gangway, Shannon among
them. A neatly dressed young man calls his name:

YOUNG MAN
Mr. Shannon? I'm your driver.

They move off together.
INT. OBSERVATORY - EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT

A warehouse, but it might be a museum - stacked with
obsolete gear from various physics and astronomy labs.
The door opens and Maggie enters, with Lily and Eddie
trailing.

MAGGIE
I think you'll be alright in
here. There's a sofa against
the wall. The grad students use
it for naps.

Maggie watches Eddie as he wanders into the room, peering
at the odd collection. Maggie turns to Lily, whispers:

MAGGIE
(continued)
Are you sleeping with him?

LILY
No.

MAGGIE
Why not?

LILY

Jesus, Maggie.

MAGGIE
He's cute.

LILY
I hadn't noticed.

MAGGIE
You hadn't noticed?

LILY
Maggie, somebody is trying to
wreck my life! Excuse me if I
haven't had time to work it into
my dating habits.

MAGGIE
You don't have any dating
habits.
A look from Lily.
MAGGIE

(continued)
There's only one sofa.

LILY
We'll work something out.

MAGGIE
Too bad.

EXT. VIRGINIA SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

A black government sedan pulls into the driveway and
toward the white frame house set back from the road. As
the car nears the house, a sensor registers its presence,
bathing the house and surrounding area in high intensity
light, revealing three other cars parked nearby.

Shannon emerges from the car, enters the house.

INT. VIRGINIA SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Shannon enters. Collier is there to greet him.

COLLIER
Hello, Tony. Good flight?

SHANNON
Good enough. .

COLLIER
You know Art Bentley from
Intelligence. This is Paul Ryan
from D.O.D and Arthur Coburn
from State.

Three men nod hellos.
COLLIER
(continued)
You know the drill. We have to
log you in.

He offers Shannon a standard form, which Shannon reads
quickly and signs under the gaze of the others. He looks
up when he's done:

SHANNON
What's up?

COLLIER
Better have a seat.

Shannon sits on the sofa.

COLLIER
(continued)
The short of it is you had a
leak. We think the Chinese
government had Chen's family
back in Shanghai. They put the
squeeze on him and he broke.

Shannon absorbs this without a flicker:

SHANNON
When?

COLLIER
Early on, from all we can tell.

SHANNON
Who else?

COLLIER
We think Miss Naughton. Maybe
Eddie Kopek.

SHANNON
Impossible.

COLLIER
You were close to him.

SHANNON
I hired him.
BENTLEY
We're checking on him, Tony. It
could be they set him up.
Planted the money.

SHANNON
Why?

BENTLEY
We're guessing. Maybe to hide
Naughton and Chen.

COLLIER
We need him.

SHANNON
You've got half the known
universe looking for him.

COLLIER
Tony, we have reason to believe
they can't get the damned thing
working.
We think they're missing a piece
of the puzzle. It's possible
Kopek has it.
Maybe it's Naughton. Maybe
both. If it's true, then they
like looking for him, too.

COBURN
If the FBI gets him, it'll be on
Ted Koppel by nightfall. we're
in a very sensitive situation
with the Chinese government. The
bureau wants to make it public.

SHANNON
Fuck the Chinese. They're
stealing secrets.

COBURN
When the time comes, we'll fuck
the Chinese.

SHANNON
Why don't you just call the
bureau off?
COLLIER
They'd look bad, they'd never go
quietly. We'd have a lot of
explaining to do. what kind of
guy is this Kopek?

SHANNON
Don't underestimate him.

COLLIER
Smart enough to keep the bureau
out of his hair?

SHANNON
I don't know. If he's that
smart, he's also smart enough to
keep you out of his hair.

COLLIER
We have an advantage.

SHANNON
What's that?

COLLIER
We have you.
INT. OBSERVATORY - EQUIPMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Lily lies on the couch, Eddie on a makeshift arrangement
on the floor nearby.

EDDIE
Lily? You awake?

LILY
Yes.
EDDIE
Do you have the fax from Chen?
LILY
Why?
EDDIE

Let me see it.

LILY
You want to brush up on your
Chinese?
And WE CUT TO:

INT. OBSERVATORY - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The watchman is making his rounds, checking doors.
EQUIPMENT ROOM

Eddie is studying the fax, Lily kneeling beside him.

EDDIE
There's a fax number here.

LILY
What about it?

EDDIE
So let's find out where it came
from.

LILY

You mean send a fax?

EDDIE
No. whoever sent the fax from
Chen would know exactly where we
are.
Some other way.

Lily thinks.
LILY
I send E mail to China all the
time. I could ask somebody to
check the number.
She peers at Eddie. New found warmth in her voice:
LILY
(continued)
You do believe me.
He puts his hand to her mouth, hushing her; they listen
as the watchman's FOOTSTEPS ring just beyond the door.
The door handle turns, but it's locked. The watchman's
FOOTSTEPS

fade down the hall, and Lily breathes at last.
EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - MORNING

A small, frame house, snowbound but for the neatly
shoveled walk, on the grounds of the observatory. Maggie
emerges, her arms loaded down with old clothes, a coffee
cup in her hand, a newspaper stuffed under her arm. She
crosses toward the observatory.

INT. OBSERVATORY - HALL - MORNING

Maggie enters. The watchman from the night before is
still there.

MAGGIE
Hi, George. You still here?

WATCHMAN
Frank went ice fishing. Doing a
double shift. You had some
visitors last night.

He eyes the clothes, the coffee cup. Maggie takes a gulp
of coffee.

MAGGIE
Yeah. I did. An old... friend.
From graduate school.

WATCHMAN
That today's paper?

MAGGIE
Yeah. I'll let you have it when
I'm finished. See ya.

INT. OBSERVATORY - EQUIPMENT ROOM - MORNING

Maggie enters, waking Eddie and Lily. She dumps the
clothes on a counter.

MAGGIE
I brought you a change of
clothes.

EDDIE
What for?

She tosses him the morning paper; Eddie scans the
headlines:
"DRAGNET FOR BLAST SUSPECTS WIDENS'

MAGGIE
They've got a pretty good
description of what you guys are

wearing.

LILY
Maggie, we need to send some E
mail.

Maggie takes a second to think:

MAGGIE
Student Union.

EXT. OBSERVATORY - DAY

Maggie's beat-up Plymouth is stuck in the snow and ice.
She is behind the wheel, Eddie and Lily pushing, but it's
no use. The watchman approaches, calling:

WATCHMAN
Need a hand?

MAGGIE
(under her breath: )
Shit.
(cheerily: )
Would you? George, these are my
friends Mary and... and John.

He crosses to the rear of the car.

WATCHMAN
Which one is Mary? Just
kidding. Let's give 'er the ol'
heave ho.

The three of them put their shoulders to the car, and it
slowly frees itself from the mush.

WATCHMAN
(continued)
There you are. Where you
headed, Miss Horner?

MAGGIE
The Union.
WATCHMAN
Oh, how about that paper?

MAGGIE
Oh, the paper. I'll get youa
new one.

She waves and pulls away. The watchman returns to the
observatory, just as a campus police car pulls up at the
door.

CAMPUS COP
Hiya, George. Looking for
Margaret Horner.

WATCHMAN
Just missed her.

There's a federal agent in the seat beside him. He hands
two photos to the watchman:

AGENT
Have you seen these people?

PHOTOS
Eddie and Lily.

EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

Awash in students, coming and going. In the parking area
outside, a half dozen charter buses sit idling in the
frigid air.

INT. STUDENT UNION - COMPUTER CENTER - DAY

Rows of personal computers: Maggie and Lily sit at one
of, them, waiting for a response.

Eddie is a short way off, peering out of the window at
the buses.

MAGGIE
(whispers: )
How'd it go?

LILY
Now did what go?
She looks

COMPUTER

MAGGIE
Last night.

LILY
I think we should split up.

MAGGIE
(appalled: )
Why?

LILY
Because they're looking for two
people.

MAGGIE
Oh. Yeah.

up, sees Eddie in his changed clothes:

MAGGIE
(continued)
God, he looks great in tweed,
doesn't he?

begins printing out the response to Lily's E mail; it's
in Chinese. Lily stares at the message, dumbfounded, as
Eddie crosses to them.

She looks

EDDIE
What does it say?

LILY
It says the fax number is
assigned to a personal residence
in Beijing.

EDDIE
What residence?

up, peers into his face before she answers:

LILY
The United States Military
Attaché.
INT. STUDENT UNION - HALLWAY - DAY

A bank of pay phones in a busy hallway. Maggie is at one
of the phones, Eddie and Lily hovering nearby.

MAGGIE
Anthony Shannon, please...

INT. SHANNON'S CHICAGO OFFICE - DAY
Shannon's secretary on the phone, as we intercut:
SECRETARY
I'm afraid he's not here. Who

may I say is calling?

MAGGIE
It's personal...

The secretary looks up at FBI agent Schmidt, sitting
beside some fancy electronic gear, listening in. He
shrugs.
SECRETARY
He's in Washington. Would you
like me to transfer the call?

MAGGIE
Yes.

Schmidt peers down at his gear, casually: the number on
Maggie's phone appears.

EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

A half dozen police cars pull up outside the union,
disgorge officers...

INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

Meanwhile, Maggie awaits the transfer; she whispers to
Eddie:

MAGGIE
He's in Washington...

EDDIE
Washington!
WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)
Mr. Shannon's office.

MAGGIE
Anthony Shannon, please.

WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)
Who's calling?

MAGGIE
It's personal.

WASHINGTON SECRETARY (V.0.)
Can you hold, please?

Maggie holds as
POLICE

enter the union, begin fanning out. We CUT TO:

INT. SHANNON'S CHICAGO OFFICE - DAY

as Agent Schmidt listens into the transferred call and WE
CUT TO:
INT. SHANNON'S WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY

as Shannon picks up a telephone: it is attached to an
electronic device, and when Shannon speaks...

SHANNON
Tony Shannon...

...the phones on

AGENT SCHMIDT

squawk and emit a pure digital static that makes Schmidt
wince and we CUT TO:

INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

as Maggie leaves the booth and hands the phone to Eddie,
who enters:
EDDIE
It's Eddie.

SHANNON
Eddie! Where are you?

EDDIE
I'm in Madison. Listen, this is
crazy: The fax from Chen came
from the US embassy in
Beijing...
He looks out of the phone booth at a hallway full of

cops:

SHANNON
Are you secure?

EDDIE
No. I'm not.

SHANNON
Eddie, listen to me carefully.
We're gonna pick you up. Stay
where you are...
The last of the cops pass, heading down the hall.

EDDIE
I can't stay where I am. I'll
come to you.
He hangs up as
SHANNON
is left hanging:
SHANNON
Eddie?
INT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
Eddie has Lily by the hand, leading her quickly down the
hall in the opposite direction of the cops, Maggie
hustling beside them.

Through the doors to the outside, we can SEE

TwO COPS
and the FBI agent we saw at the observatory taking up
positions where they can keep an eye on the entrance.

MAGGIE
Lily, wait. Let me help. Try
those buses.

She hugs Eddie; then she hugs Lily:

MAGGIE
(continued)
Good luck. Don't be such a
jerk.

And she's out the door.

EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY
Maggie emerges, crosses to the cops:

MAGGIE
Excuse me... you know those
people in the paper this
morning?

AGENT
Yes?

MAGGIE
I'm Maggie Horner. I think they
just snuck out the back way.

EDDIE AND LILY

watch this from their vantage point just inside the
entrance. Maggie points down the walk leading away from
the union, then follows as the cops and the agent head
off in that direction.

And then, Eddie and Lily burst through the doors...

EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

...and cross rapidly toward the buses. A young man
dressed incongruously in a raccoon coat and a straw
boater stands before a bus door with a clipboard in his
hands. He grins as he sees Eddie and Lily approaching:
RACOON COAT
Mr. Findlay?

EDDIE
(thinking quickly)
Yes.

RACOON COAT
(checking off a name)
You're the last. Get right on.

Eddie and Lily climb the bus stairs. And now we see the
placard in the window: YOUNG REPUBLICAN CLUB OF
WISCONSIN.

RACOON COAT
(continued)
Excuse me... are there two of
you?

EDDIE
Yeah. This is Mrs. Findlay.

RACOON COAT
Oh. I didn't realize you were
both coming.

EDDIE
Last minute thing.

RACOON COAT
No problem. Delighted to have
you both...

And as they turn into the bus, the man stops them again:

RACOON COAT
(continued)
Um... excuse me. You've only
paid for one ticket.

EDDIE
Oh, sorry. How much is it?

He fumbles for his wallet:

RACOON COAT
Well you've already paid for the
room. That'll be another ninety
dollars.
EDDIE
The room.

RACOON COAT
At the lodge, yes. Did you want
separate rooms?.

LILY
Of course not.

She slips her arm through Eddie's.

RACOON COAT
That includes meals, of course.

Eddie peers into his wallet.

EDDIE
Will you take sixty on account?
I'll have to get to a cash
machine.

RACOON COAT
Oh... what the heck. We're all
Republicans.

They board the bus, and the man in the raccoon coat waves
as the driver pulls away.

And as he heads for the union, a man comes running
through the parking lot, lugging a pair of boots and
skis. It is, of course, poor FINDLAY, desperately out of
breath:

FINDLAY
Where's the bus?

RACOON COAT
Just left.

FINDLAY
Goddamit: I paid for my ticket.

RACOON COAT
Who are you?

FINDLAY
Jack Findlay.
Raccoon coat turns and peers after the bus, now too far
away to hail. Then he turns back to Findlay, as if
something has just occurred to him:

RACOON COAT
Mr. Findlay... do you know where
your wife is?

EXT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY

A government sedan pulls up in front of a handsome town
house. Agent Ford emerges from the car, along with a
driver. They cross to the entrance. WE CUT TO:

SHOT - FILE FOLDER
As it drops on an elegantly polished desk.

FORD
The Franklin Foundation's file
at the IRS. Shall I tell you
what's in it?

We are in

INT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - SHANNON'S OFFICE - DAY
Shannon is at his desk, the file in front of him. Ford
stands before him as the other agent sits.

FORD
Your funding comes from a number
of different sources. But when
the checks are cashed, they end
up at the same bank. In
classified accounts.
Why do you suppose that is?

SHANNON
I couldn't say.

Shannon lights his cigar. Ford drops a second file on
top of the first.

FORD
Your resume. Very impressive.
Leaves out one important thing.

SHANNON
Which is?
FORD
Which is who pays your salary.

SHANNON
And who would that be?

FORD
Well, now, that's where it gets
interesting. I have a friend at
Langley who tells me they pay
your salary.

SHANNON
That is interesting. Have to
check into that myself.

A deep drag on the cigar, a cloud of smoke.

FORD
A man might be forgiven for
concluding that your foundation
is a front for the people at
Langley as well. Mr. Shannon,
do I need to tell you that
interfering with a federal
investigation is a crime?

SHANNON
I know the law, Mr. Ford.

FORD
Then perhaps you'd like to share
a little information with us.

SHANNON
Such as?

FORD
Such as what's going on here.

SHANNON
I have no idea. I'd tell you if
I did.

Ford leans over, until he is practically nose to nose
with Shannon.

FORD
Alright. I'm going to do you the
favor of being frank with you.
These people are suspects in
crimes of murder and espionage.
I'm gonna find them. If it turns
out you and your friends at
Langley are trying to get in my
way, I'll fry your ass so bad
you'll never sit down again.

He gathers up the folders and leaves Shannon puffing on
his cigar.

EXT. STUDENT UNION - DAY

Findlay and the Raccoon Coat are studying photos of Lily
and Eddie. Two cops and the agent await their judgment.

RACOON COAT
That's them.

AGENT
They got on the bus?

RACOON COAT
Just before it pulled out.

AGENT
Where's it going?

RACOON COAT
Lake Geneva. They oughta be
there pretty soon.

EXT. SKI LODGE - DAY

The bus pulls into the parking area and stops. The
Republicans alight and head for the registration desk
Eddie and Lily among them.

LILY
What do we do now?

EDDIE
We're the Findlays. We do
whatever they would do.

LILY
Which is?
EDDIE
I don't know. I think we
register.

And we CUT TO:

SHOT - REGISTRATION CARD

already made out to Jack Findlay. We are in

INT. SKI LODGE LOBBY - DAY

and there is bedlam at the desk as the busload of
Republicans registers. The clerk is eyeing
Lily:

CLERK
I'm sorry sir, we have you down
for a single.

A helpful Republican (MAXWELL) offers:

MAXWELL
Would you like my double?

EDDIE
No, it's alright.

He's already signing the card.

MAXWELL
It's no bother, really. My wife
couldn't make it. My name's
Maxwell.

EDDIE
(reading of the
registration: )
Jack Findlay.

MAXWELL
Jack Findlay? That's strange.
I know a Jack Findlay. He was
supposed to come on this trip.

LILY
Oh, that's the other Jack
Findlay.
Eddie has seen something outside:
P.O.V.

A state police car pulls up to the entrance, lights
flashing. And another. And another.

MAXWELL
There's two Jack Findlays?

LILY
We're the pro choice Findlays.

EDDIE
Excuse me.

He takes Lily by the arm, begins walking her toward the
rear of the lobby.

CLERK
Mr. Findlay? Your key:

But Eddie and Lily are already running...

EXT. SKI LODGE - REAR - DAY

...out of the back entrance and down through the snow, to
the lake where a half dozen ice boats skim along under
the brisk wind.

LILY
Where are you going?

EDDIE
I don't know:

They reach the frozen lake just as a man has finished
rigging his ice boat for a sail. Eddie turns, sees the
cops emerging from the entrance behind him. He shouts at
the boater:

EDDIE
(continued)
Hey: The cops are looking for
you!

BOATER
What for?
EDDIE
I don't know. They're pretty
steamed. Shall I hold your
boat?

The boater watches as the police come running down
through the snow, shouting and pointing.

BOATER
What the hell...

Eddie takes the boat as the boater crosses toward the
advancing cops. He shouts:

BOATER
(continued)
I can't hear you!

And when he turns, he is shocked to see Eddie and Lily on
his boat, sailing for the opposite shore.

BOATER
(continued)
Hey! Come back here!

EDDIE AND LILY

on the boat, sailing. The boat is picking up speed,
bouncing from side to side. They can barely hold on:

LILY
Do you know what you're doing?

EDDIE
I sailed a boat once.

LILY
An ice boat?

EDDIE
No. Gotta be the same thing,
right?

The boat nearly tips over, sliding crablike across the
slick expanse of ice. Then it spins, loses the wind as

TWO POLICE CARS

move down the packed snow beside the lodge and onto the
ice.
LILY
They're coming!

Eddie manages to fill the sails, and the boat takes off
again.

LILY
(continued)
Look out!

A fishing shanty looms ahead. An ice fisherman emerges,
sees the ice boat coming, barely under control, his eyes
widening as it WOOSHES past the shanty...

...and spins out of control. Eddie manages to regain the
wind and he takes off again, heading back toward the
shanty. The fisherman watches dumbfounded as the boat
seems bent on attacking

...but Eddie manages to avoid a collision just as one of
the police cars comes roaring along the ice, narrowing
the distance...

...Eddie swerves, the boat careening on one runner,
narrowly missing the police car and the cop hits the
brakes, the car doing a spinning 360 and wiping out the
shanty in an explosion of boards and fishing tackle.
FISHERMAN
Goddam sonofabitch!

EDDIE AND LILY

are now in the center of the lake, running before the
wind, but behind them, the second police car is making
headway along the ice, narrowing the distance between
them. Lily has to shout to be heard:

LILY
I'm freezing!

EDDIE
Me, too.

He aims the boat toward the opposite shore line,
approaching rapidly, but suddenly A SECOND ICE BOAT
barreling along an a perpendicular tack is bearing down
on them.

LILY
Eddie!
He sees the boat just in time to yank his rudder hard,
sending his own boat into a spin and clipping the other
boat with a sickening CRAACCCKK!!!...

EDDIE'S BOAT

is missing a runner, now, tipped at an odd angle, sliding
toward a snowbank on the far edge of the lake, spinning,
grinding a path across the ice with a painful SHRIEK...

...and dumping Eddie and Lily into the snowbank. Silence
for a long moment as

THE POLICE CAR

spins it's wheels against the slick ice, making progress
toward the wrecked boat and at last

LILY

rises, takes Eddie by his arm, almost drags him through
the snow, away from the lake.

And they run.

Behind them, the cop in the second car realizes too late
he's heading for an ice fisherman's large hole. He pumps
his brakes, the nose of the car dips, and then drifts
slowly and inevitably into the hole. Up go the back
wheels, spinning uselessly in mid air.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Eddie and Lily run. But the snow is deep and they are
exhausted, and the tracks they leave show how impossible
it is to keep to a straight line. Lily stumbles, falls.
They are both fighting for breath.

LILY
Wait...

It is a long moment before they can speak.

LILY
(continued)
This is insane...

A sudden CRACK through the trees, a rifle shot,
splintering wood near by and the two of them are off
again, scrambling...
LILY

racing through the trees, a look of terror an her face
now. And Eddie calls:

EDDIE
Lily!

He is burrowing into the snow, making a cave. He grabs
her, forces her down into the hole, scurries in behind
her, then brings a pile of snow down to cover the
entrance. Ina flash they are invisible.

And we HEAR FOOTSTEPS and HEAVY BREATHING; it is a moment
before

TWO HUNTERS
appear, slogging through the snow, rifles at the ready.

HUNTER #1
You sure it was a buck?

HUNTER #2
Hadda be. Big ol' hairy
sonofabitch.
And as they move an into the woods, WE CUT TO

EDDY AND LILY

stuffed like rabbits in a cozy hole, their noses inches
away, peering into each others' eyes.

INT. COSMOS CLUB - EVENING

An old-boys club (and now, old-girls, too) at cocktail
time: stuffed chairs, deep carpet, white coated waiters
serving drinks. A woman (FLORENCE) enters, attractive,
about 50, pauses briefly as she searches for someone,
then crosses to

SHANNON
sitting in an easy chair. He rises with a smile, kisses
her cheek.

SHANNON
I swear you get more beautiful
every time I set eyes on you.
She sits.

FLORENCE
Liar.

SHANNON.
It's the truth.

FLORENCE
It's okay, the lie will do.

SHANNON
What are you drinking?

FLORENCE
The usual.

He calls the waiter over:

SHANNON
Bourbon and soda.

FLORENCE
That was a test.

SHANNON
Shame on you.

FLORENCE
I've been reading about you.

SHANNON
I suspect you have.

FLORENCE
What's going on?

SHANNON
I need some help, Flo.

FLORENCE
And I thought this was purely
social.

SHANNON
I wish it were.

FLORENCE
Me, too.
SHANNON
Chinese physicist by the name of
Chen Lu

FLORENCE
The missing Chen...

SHANNON
..and his assistant, Lily
Naughton. Collier's been
tracking them.

FLORENCE
Collier: Is he involved in
this?

SHANNON
I need to find out what he
knows.

FLORENCE

He knows everything. He's kissed
every important butt in
Washington.

SHANNON
I've got egg on my face, Flo. I
found Chen. I brought him here
from China.

FLORENCE
I'll do what I can. Be careful
of Collier. He won't play with
you unless he can keep your
balls in a jar by the door.

Shannon grins:

SHANNON

I like to take mine with me.
FLORENCE

I wouldn't mind holding them

myself.

EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Nestled in among the trees, boarded up and closed for
winter.
INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

The SOUND of BREAKING GLASS, and then a hand reaches in
through a broken window and unlocks the door.

Eddie and Lily enter. Sheets shroud the furniture,
matching the cool white landscape visible through the
windows in the moonlight. Lily shivers violently.

Eddie grabs a blanket that's being used as a covering for
a chair, wraps Lily in it. She's making involuntary
sounds, her teeth chattering, her whole body shaking. He
rubs her back, puts his arms around her.

EDDIE
Come on, lie down.

She does. Eddie goes down with her, holds her tightly to
himself, whispering in her ear:

EDDIE
(continued)
Shhh... it's okay... you're okay
now...

She's weeping from cold and fatigue, but gradually her
shivering stops...

LATER

Lily has calmed down and warmed up. She lies beside
Eddie, wrapped tightly in her blanket.

In the dark, they speak in near whispers:

LILY
Can we stay here?

EDDIE
They'll have the dogs and
choppers out by daylight. We've
got to get to Shannon.

LILY
It's too dangerous.

EDDIE
It's our only chance.
LILY
Eddie, the fax came from the
embassy... whoever's involved in
this is in Washington.

EDDIE
He's the only one who can help
us.
LILY
You trust him.
EDDIE
Yeah.
Silence.
LILY
I don't trust anyone. I think I
trust you.
EDDIE

He's like my dad, Lily. After
my dad died, he gave me a job.
He made me go back to school.
He believed in me.

LILY
I hope you're right.

EDDIE
Get some sleep.
EXT. SHANNON'S HOUSE - WASHINGTON - NIGHT
A secluded house on a quiet, suburban street. A light
burns in the bedroom.
INT. SHANNON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
A phone RINGS on Shannon's nightstand. Shannon picks up:

SHANNON
Tony Shannon.

FLORENCE (V.0.)
Tony, it's Flo. Are you secure?

SHANNON
Yes.
FLORENCE (V.0.)
I've checked on Collier for you.
He's off the reservation.
SHANNON
What's going on?
INT. BAR - NIGHT

Florence is at a pay phone:

FLORENCE
I don't know. The Chen story is
a fake. Langley was never
tracking him.
Same with the Naughton woman.

SHANNON (V.O.)
What else?

FLORENCE
That's all I have.

Silence from Shannon. Then:

SHANNON (V.O.)
Thanks, Flo.

FLORENCE
Be careful.

She hangs up. AND WE CUT TO:

SHANNON

sitting an his bed. Rolling his unlit cigar through his
fingers.

INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

Lily is asleep on the sofa. A hand reaches down, touches
her shoulder gently. She wakens with a start, blinks her
eyes open: it's Eddie.

EDDIE
Sorry... we have to go.

LILY
What's the matter?
EDDIE
Sun'll be up in an hour.

And WE CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS ROAD - NIGHT

Running lights from a Chevy pick up cut a path through
the woods...

INT. PICK UP TRUCK - NIGHT
...as Eddie drives, Lily in the seat beside him.

LILY
How'd you get it started?

EDDIE.
Everybody knows how to do that
in my neighborhood.

LILY
And gas?

EDDIE
Drained the lawnmower.

LILY
We're criminals, now.

EDDIE
You were sleeping.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

The truck emerges from the woods, passes along a bluff
with a commanding view of the countryside.

EDDIE'S P.O.V.

Down the bluff, we can see squad cars parked an the road
leading away from the woods: a road block.

EDDIE
I was afraid of that. They'll
be all over these woods by sun
up.

Lily is studying a road map from the glove compartment.
LILY
If the lake is that way, there's
a freeway this way. They
wouldn't block the freeway,
would they?

EDDIE
Good point.

LILY
I don't see how we get there.

EDDIE
As the crow flies.

He swings the truck around, turns off the road and into a
farm lane, and WE CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STAGING AREA - DAWN

The sky is just light enough to make out the state police
cars, unmarked black sedans, and police choppers at the
ready. A dozen cops and FBI agents prowl among the
vehicles as the choppers rise like giant birds, head
toward the wooded area atop the bluff...

EXT. FARM FIELD - DAWN
The truck comes bouncing over the field, through the corn
stalks, turns down a tractor lane and pulls up to a snow
fence separating the farm field from a freeway, just up a
short rise on the other side.
INT. TRUCK - DAWN
Eddie puts the truck in gear:
EDDIE
Buckle up. And hold on to your
hat.

He backs the truck up for a running start, guns the
engine, and heads directly for the fence...

FENCE

closer, closer... and suddenly the fence shatters with
the impact of the
TRUCK

slipping and sliding now, into the icy ditch that
collects the runoff from the rise leading to the freeway.
Eddie tries to force his way through, but it's no use,
the wheels are spinning against the snow and slush. They
are stuck.

INT. CHOPPER - DAWN

The choppers are cruising the woods, peering down onto
the rooftops of the summer homes, one of which Eddie and
Lily have just left. Fresh tire tracks through the newly
fallen snow catch the eye of the chopper pilot. He
speaks into the radio:

PILOT
Chopper one... we've got some
tire tracks...

EXT. TRUCK - DAY
Eddie is pushing, trying to get the pick up unstuck.
Lily is behind the wheel.

EDDIE
Give her some gas!

She floors it.
EDDIE
(continued)
Not so much! Let it rock a
little...

She tries again. No luck.

INT. CHOPPER - DAWN

Following the tire tracks as they veer off the road and
into a farm field.

PILOT
Chopper one... we got somethin'
goin' on here...
EXT. TRUCK - DAWN

Eddie is straining with all his might. At last, there is
movement, the truck inching ahead slowly, along the
ditch, and then Lily points it uphill and gives it the
gas:

EDDIE
No! No... don't... not so fast.

He watches as the truck slips back down the incline,
then, miraculously catches hold, spins up the bank and to
the crest beside the road. Eddie runs:

INT. TRUCK - DAWN

Eddie opens the door, swings himself in.

EDDIE
Nice work.

Lily makes a muscle. She heads for the freeway, slides
into the trickle of early morning traffic as...
INT. CHOPPER - DAWN

...The chopper passes over the fields and hovers above
the broken snow fence.

PILOT
Chopper one... they made it to
the freeway.

EXT. STAGING AREA - DAWN

A federal agent stands listening to his radio. He
mutters:

AGENT
Sonofabitch.

And we CUT TO:
SHOT - BREAKFAST PLATE
Two poached eggs, beautifully arrayed with a sprig of

parsley and a neatly scalloped orange
slice. We are in...
INT. RESTAURANT - MORNING

...a fancy hotel restaurant, a jacketed waiter serving

Collier his morning fare. Shannon is opposite,

coffee.

SHANNON
Why the-bullshit?

COLLIER
No bullshit, Tony. You know
everything I do.

SHANNON
That's the bullshit. That, and
the story about Chen.

Collier looks up from his eggs.

COLLIER
What makes you say so?

SHANNON
Let's just say I have my
sources.

COLLIER

Alright. Let's just say he's
serving a larger purpose. So am
I. So are you.

SHANNON
Meaning?

COLLIER
Meaning we're just actors here.
We don't know how the play comes
out.
You might be the villain.

SHANNON
How so?

COLLIER
Chen was your boy, Tony. You
brought him to the party. You
brought in this Kopek kid.
You're a suspect. Hell, you
even lied to Congress. You said
the project was private, no
involvement from Langley. Who

drinking
do you think would believe you
now? Who do you think is going
to be responsible if it blows up
in our faces?

SHANNON
Except there was no espionage.

COLLIER
There is now.

SHANNON
I could make a hell of a mess
going down, George.

Collier studies him for a beat:

COLLIER
You could.

SHANNON
That makes me a pretty good
villain.

COLLIER
What do you want?

SHANNON
The truth.

Collier pokes his egg, watches the yellow run onto the
plate.

COLLIER
I'll see what I can do.
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

The truck takes the Zanesville exit off the freeway.

INT. TRUCK - DAY
Lily still drives, Eddie in the seat beside her.

LILY
Can't we just call him?
EDDIE
His phones are tapped for sure.
They'll be waiting for us.

LILY
How much money do we have?

EDDIE
Why?

LILY
I saw something in a movie once.

She turns onto the main drag.

INT. ZANESVILLE FLOWER SHOP - DAY

Lily enters, crosses to the counter. The clerk is an old
duffer in a plaid shirt.

LILY
I'd like to send some flowers to
Washington.

CLERK

LILY
Yes.

CLERK

I'd like to send something to
Washington. Wouldn't be

flowers.

LILY
May I include a message with
that?

CLERK

You can if you hold your horses.

As the clerk prepares his order form, Lily is suddenly
aware of the TV, it's volume tuned low, sitting down the
counter:

NEWSCASTER
New developments in America's
biggest manhunt in recent memory
- the two suspects being sought
in connection with the Chicago
blast eluded police today in a
daring getaway...

TV SET

now showing photos of Eddie and Lily just as

EDDIE

enters the shop with a bag of fast food. Lily shoots him
a look, nods to the Tv, just as the clerk snaps it off.

CLERK
Can't hear yourself think with
that damn thing yapping at you.
Now, who we sending this to?

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Shannon rides a cargo elevator down, accompanied by two
suited men - security personnel.

The elevator's open walls reveal a descent through rock
and steel girders toa...

INT. VAULTED CHAMBER - DAY

...where the elevator door opens and Shannon emerges.
Collier is waiting for him.

COLLIER
Hello, Tony. This way.

He ushers Shannon through a door into a...

INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

...modestly appointed board room: a large conference
table and chairs, in which Bentley, Coburn and Ryan await
his entrance.

SHANNON
Gentlemen.

They nod helloes; Shannon sits in the chair provided for
him.
Mirthless

COLLIER
I'm sorry we couldn't have been
more open with you from the
beginning.., we've pretty much
had to proceed on a need to know
basis. And until now, we felt
you didn't.

BENTLEY
Tony, before we begin, I'd like
to assure you that what you hear
today will remain inside these
walls.

SHANNON
You mean you won't tell or I
won't tell?

chuckles.

COLLIER
You're right about Dr. Chen,
Tony. There was no espionage.
Your lab was destroyed on our
orders.

SHANNON
And Bucky?

COLLIER
I'm sorry to say, also on our
orders.

SHANNON
Who are you?

COLLIER
We're an interagency team. We
advise the president on
technology and defense.

RYAN
Tony, we were in a crisis
situation. We had to act
quickly. None of us wanted to
see Dr. Bucholtz hurt. We had
no choice.

SHANNON
Why not?
BENTLEY
He was going to release the
information needed to duplicate
his machine on the internet. It
would have created chaos. The
oil business, the automobile
business would have been in
turmoil. There would have been
financial panic.
The relationships on which the
world has run for fifty years
would have been turned upside-
down. We couldn't let it
happen.

SHANNON
So you had him killed.

COBURN

It was very regrettable, Tony.
SHANNON

And Chen?
COLLIER

We took him. We made him an
offer.

SHANNON
Where is he?
COLLIER
He's here. You can see him.
SHANNON
And Eddie Kopek?
COLLIER
He and Chen were our cover
story. They were simply... how

should I put it? Convenient.
We were going to throw then to
the FBI and let nature take its
course.

SHANNON
Nature and some trumped up
bullshit from CIA.

COLLIER
If you like.
SHANNON
So why don't you?

COLLIER
Tony, the story we told you
about not being able to make the
thing work was true.

SHANNON
Only it's not the Chinese.

COLLIER
That's correct.

SHANNON
You think he's the missing piece
of the puzzle?

COLLIER
We hope so. We believe so. He
and Miss Naughton.

SHANNON
And I'm your Judas goat. I lead
Eddie to the slaughter.

COLLIER
If he cooperates, there is no
slaughter.

SHANNON
What if I refuse?
COLLIER
We don't think you can, Tony.
SHANNON
Why not?
COLLIER

We're in very deep. We're
playing for very high stakes.

SHANNON
That wouldn't be a threat, would
it?

BENTLEY
We've won the cold war, Tony.
We're not about to give the
trophy back.
The door opens, and a security officer enters:

OFFICER
A phone call for Mr. Shannon.
Shall I put it through?

SHANNON
Please.

The men and women around the table stare curiously at
Shannon. And WE CUT TO:

INT. SHANNON'S WASHINGTON OFFICE - DAY

Shannon's Washington secretary an the secure phone. She
has a box of roses an her lap and a card in her hand:

SECRETARY
I didn't know whether to bother
you or not... it's strange.
Shall I read it?...
(reading: )
Smithsonian, 5pm. Today. Eddie. That's it.

INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

Shannon hangs up. Looks around the room at the others.
Slips a cigar out of his coat pocket, rolls it in his
fingers, considering.

INT. TRUCK - DAY

Eddie drives, swings into the lane marked Route 70,
Washington. He looks over at Lily:

EDDIE
How come you speak Chinese?

LILY
I grew up in China. My parents
were missionaries.

EDDIE
Missionaries?

LILY
Yeah. Everytime I hear the
expression "missionary
position: I think of my parents
Oing it.

She reddens, embarrassed. Then she laughs:

LILY
(continued)
God, why did I say that? I'm
such a prude!

EXT. FRANKLIN FOUNDATION - DAY
A DELIVERYMAN exits from the foundation, crosses to his

truck - Dupont Circle Florists stenciled an the side. But
before he can enter, two federal agents stop him.

AGENT
FBI. Would you come with us,
please?

DELIVERYMAN
Me?

INT. SHANNON'S CAR - DAY

A black government sedan, a DRIVER in the front seat,
Shannon in the rear. From his position, Shannon can see
the driver's eye searching the traffic behind him in the
rear view mirror.

SHANNON
Are we being followed?

DRIVER
Yes, sir. Shall I try and lose
them?

SHANNON

No. There's a supermarket up on
the right a few blocks. Pull in
there.

DRIVER
Yes sir.

INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY

Ford and another agent talk to the OWNER:
OWNER
They were sent by phone. I do
remember that.

FORD
Do you recall where they were
sent from?

OWNER
I don't. I'm sorry. It's
probably on the receipt.

He crosses to his counter, opens a drawer, removes a pile
of receipts, begins going through them, slowly, licking
his thumb for traction.

OWNER
(continued)
Here it is. Zanesville Flower
Shop, Zanesville, Ohio.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - PARKING LOT - DAY

Shannon's car pulls into the lot and stops. Shannon
emerges as a second car, another unmarked sedan, pulls
into a spot nearby. Shannon crosses to the supermarket
entrance. Two agents from the second car follow.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
Shannon enters, takes a shopping cart, drops a few items
into it, then crosses to the meat counter. He says to
the man behind the counter (BUTCHER):
SHANNON

I'd like a special cut, I want

to speak to the butcher, if you

don't mind.

He walks quickly to the doors to the rear.

BUTCHER
I am the butcher.

But Shannon is already through the doors.
BUTCHER
(continued)
You wanna talk to the butcher,
you gotta talk to me. Can I help
you?

It's one of the agents who stands before the counter.

INT. SUPERMARKET - STORAGE AREA - DAY

Shannon walks quickly through and out the back door...

EXT. SUPERMARKET, LOADING DOCK - DAY

...and onto the loading dock, where a van, white,
unmarked, awaits. The van pulls to the dock and Shannon
enters; the van speeds away.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

The agent. Looks at his watch: something fishy. He shows
the butcher his badge:
AGENT
FBI...

And he crosses to the doors to the rear, enters, leaving
the butcher gazing after him. He points to himself:

BUTCHER

Butcher.
EXT. SUPERMARKET - LOADING DOCK - DAY
The agent emerges onto the dock, looks around. Shannon
is nowhere in sight.
EXT. SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION - PARKING AREA - DAY
The pick up truck pulls into the Lot and stops, Eddie and
Lily emerge, cross to the main building. Eddie looks at

his watch.

EDDIE
We're a little early.
INT. ZANESVILLE FLOWER SHOP - DAY
The clerk is on the phone:

CLERK
Yes, I do remember.... young
man, young woman, very nice
couple... alright, hold on...

He puts the phone down, crosses to his waste basket,
pulls out today's paper: Eddie and Lily's photographs on
the front page. The clerk returns to the phone.

CLERK
(continued)
It's them.

INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY
Ford is on the phone. He turns to the second agent:

FORD
They were in Zanesville.
(to the phone: )
Do you recall the time?

INT. ZANESVILLE FLOWER SHOP - DAY
CLERK
Earlier today... this morning,
it was. Sent a message, too...
He scratches his head:
CLERK
(continued)
No, I can't remember.
He holds the phone away from his ear as Ford squawks:
CLERK

(continued)
Well, now, I am thinking...

EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY

HIGH ANGLE
Far below, Eddie and Lily appear between the massive
marble columns and enter the museum.

INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY

Security guards everywhere. Eddie and Lily walk past the
looming dinosaur skeleton and head up the broad stairway
to the

SECOND FLOOR

where they emerge in a long gallery. A line of arched
openings overlooks the main hall, and as they move down
the colonnade, Eddie spots

SHANNON
just entering the building.

EDDIE
There he is.

But as Lily registers her relief, Eddie sees three men
who accompany Shannon. They stop, speak for a moment,
and then the men fade into the museum, take up positions
- apparently as visitors.

EDDIE
is frozen in his place, incredulous. A long moment
before he can say to Lily:

EDDIE
What is this?

INT. DUPONT CIRCLE FLORISTS - DAY

The owner is rummaging through the waste basket, Ford
still on the phone beside him:

OWNER
We don't keep records of
messages. I might've made
notes...

He draws a scrap of paper from the basket, reads it:
OWNER

(continued)
This is it...
He hands it to Ford, who scans it quickly, starts moving
for the door...

INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY

Shannon climbs the stairs to the second floor. He
reaches the gallery, sees Eddie, sitting on a bench.
Alone. He crosses to him, sits beside him.

SHANNON
Hello, Eddie.

EDDIE
What's going on?

SHANNON
You're safe. Relax.

EDDIE
Who are your friends?

SHANNON
What friends?

EDDIE
The ones you came with.
SHANNON
I'm here by myself. Where's
Lily?
EDDIE

She never made it.

SHANNON
What do you mean?

EDDIE
She hates Washington. She's
probably a thousand miles away
by now.
Those friends.

The men Shannon entered with have moved into the gallery,
still trying to blend into the stream of visitors.

SHANNON
It's complicated, Eddie. I can
explain...
EDDIE
Go ahead.

SHANNON
You'll have to come with me.

EDDIE
Why don't you explain here?
SHANNON
I can't.
Eddie stands.
SHANNON

(continued)
Eddie, take it easy.

But the men, seeing Eddie rise, move quickly. Eddie
turns, sprints down the gallery.

The three men pursue, as visitors turn, stare at this
breach of museum decorum.

SHANNON
Eddie!

PURSUER
gaining on Eddie. Suddenly, a display comes sliding
across the floor into his path, knocking him down. Lily

has pushed it.

EDDIE
Lily, run!

She turns, sprints down the gallery as Eddie grabs the
club from the hands of "Paleolithic Man", smashes the
second pursuer in the face.

SECURITY GUARDS

come running into the gallery, but are swamped by a
stream of visitors trying to get out of the way.

EDDIE AND LILY

with two pursuers on their heels, run through a maze of
display cases looking for a way out.

The door marked "BOTANY" is unlocked and they go through
it.
INT. ATRIUM - DAY

Several workers are startled by the sudden commotion as
Eddie and Lily race through, followed seconds later by
two pursuers.

A researcher grabs a phone and dials...

EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY

Ford pulls up in his car, a second car behind. Ford and
two other agents emerge, cross to the entrance...

...just as Shannon emerges from the museum.

FORD
Grab him: Mr. Shannon, I'm
going to ask you to wait here.

SHANNON
Are you arresting me?
Ford doesn't answer. Without looking back, he enters the
museum, leaving Shannon with one of the agents.

INT. SMITHSONIAN (SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY) MUSEUM - DAY

A locomotive, a race car, and a Boeing 727 dominate the
Hall of Transportation.

Eddie and Lily race into the hall, look around, and head
for the nearest stairway.

THREE PURSUERS

enter behind them, closing the gap, until the stairwell
suddenly fills with a group of eighth graders. One of
the men breaks off and heads for another stairwell.

SECOND LEVEL

Eddie and Lily race down the balcony alongside the Boeing
727. Then Eddie sees the

PURSUER

who took the other stairway blocking their path. Eddie
runs headlong into the man, knocking them both down. But
the guy is a brute and he is still blocking the way.
Eddie turns, heads the other way.
He looks around for Lily, but she's nowhere in sight.

EDDIE
Lily?!

Nothing.

The man he knocked down is closing in; the other two are
approaching from the other side.

Eddie is trapped. Desperate, he leaps up on the 727
ENGINE POD

then scrambles over the top of the fuselage, past the
tail, and slides down the other side onto

THE WING
suspended high in midair above the hall. Eddie dashes
along the wing to the tip and vaults over the railing on

the opposite balcony.

The men make an end run around the balcony but they're
too late. Eddie has vanished.

They backtrack to the jetliner, searching.

INT. BOEING 727 - DAY

The men enter the airplane, peering behind the seats,
into the cockpit. One of the men yanks open the lavatory
door:

LILY...

stands looking out, her face a mask of fear, as the man
closes in on her.

LILY
Don't touch me!

He pins her wrists as she struggles against him. Another
of the men appears at her side. He cracks a vial of
inhalant under her nose. She goes limp.

INT. SMITHSONIAN (SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY) MUSEUM - DAY

Eddie dashes into the darkened
BRIDGE OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER

in the middle of a full alert.
VOICE

(from speaker: )

Stand by to launch aircraft.

Eddie melts into the shadows and glances around. It
looks like he's lost his pursuers.

INT. ATRIUM - DAY: -

Ford and two agents are surrounded by a half dozen
workers, all of them shouting different directions:

WORKERS
There were four of them... they
went through there... no, that
way... there were only two of

them...

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Eddie is moving along the ground floor corridor with a
mob of tourists, looking around frantically for Lily and
trying to stay invisible.

Suddenly, he stops in his tracks.

P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW

Eddie sees Lily.

EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY
The three men support Lily as she stumbles along with
them, half conscious. They lead her to a white van...
INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY

...as Eddie slams his fist against the glass in
frustration. He spots an exit at the end of the hall.
EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM (FIELD MUSEUM) - DAY

Eddie comes running out and down the broad steps. The van
is moving away. Eddie runs after it, catching sight of
something scrawled in the dust on the back: Leesburg
Construction hires scab....

...but as Eddie gets almost close enough to touch the
rear, door, the van pulls away.

He stops, out of breath. Not far away, Eddie sees
security guards moving in. He turns, dashes back down a
ramp leading to door under the museum. He enters.

INT. STEAM TUNNEL - DAY

Eddie runs down the long tunnel, footsteps echoing in the
emptiness.

EXT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY

Ford emerges from inside, crosses down the steps to
Shannon and the agent he was left with.

FORD
Better get yourself a lawyer,
Mr. Shannon. I'm gonna bust
your ass.

And Ford continues on down the steps as WE CUT TO:

INT. CAPITOL BUILDING (MADISON) - DAY

A door marked "No Public Access" opens a crack. Eddie
peeks out. He steps into the marble hallway, gently
closes the door behind him. He has no idea where he is.
He eases into another tour group.

GUIDE
...and at the end of this hall
we will see the Capitol Building
rotunda where the bodies of
Presidents Lincoln and John F.
Kennedy lay in state...
EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING (MADISON) - DAY

Eddie emerges:

P.O.V. OF CAPITOL MALL (SECOND UNIT) - DAY

the bronze statues of generals on horseback are dusted
with snow and the Washington Monument stands stark white
against the crisp winter sky. All around, American flags

snap smartly in the breeze.

Eddie pulls up his collar and descends the steps.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Eddie walks. He seems aimless, his mood dark. He
hunches his shoulders against the wind and cold, his eyes
an the pavement in front of him.

Newspapers at a kiosk sport headlines:

ELUSIVE PAIR IN D.C.?

EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A sign says "Full Chinese Meal - $2". Eddie peers in
through the frosted window, reaches into his pocket. He
pulls out a handful of change - not nearly enough. He
continues on.

Down the sidewalk, a homeless man (LARRY) is panhandling.
LARRY
Pardon me, sir. Spare some
change?
Eddie doesn't even look up.
LARRY
(continued)
That's right. Don't even look.
Eddie continues on. Larry has to call after him:
LARRY

(continued)
Nobody looks at the homeless.
Another few steps, and then Eddie stops, turns, stares at
Larry.

LARRY
(continued)
Hey! Con...TACT!

Larry salutes:
LARRY
(continued)
Yes... SIR! Lawrence
Applewhite, ready for duty, SIR!

And WE CUT TO:

INT. SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT

A line of destitute men and women snakes through a dingy
church basement, where volunteers serve soup and
sandwiches. Eddie and Larry are among them, only Eddie
is wearing Larry's clothes and Larry has on Eddie's
tweeds. Somehow, Eddie looks right at home among these
people, and in Eddie's clothes, Larry looks like visiting
royalty.

LARRY
Thank you sister... set my man
up here with whatever he
needs... thank you brother...
Hey! One dinky ol1' baloney
sandwich for my man? Shame
on you! He's a growin' boy.

The volunteer dumps another limp baloney sandwich on
Eddie's plate.

LARRY
(continued)
You want that?

Eddie puts the sandwich on Larry's plate.
LARRY

(continued)
Thank you, bro.
EXT. LARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

A beat up Dodge Dart, circa 1968. The back seat is
filled with the odds and ends of Larry's existence. And
at the moment, it is also filled with Eddie, huddled
under a blanket. Larry is in the front seat, huddled
under his own blanket.

LARRY
Can't sleep in them shelters,
bro. Very low class of people
in there. Steal your goddam
teeth if you open your mouth to
snore.

EDDIE
Where's Leesburg?

LARRY
Leesburg? Only Leesburg I know
is in Virginia.

EDDIE
Your car make it that far?

LARRY
Hell, yes.

Suddenly, a light flashes inside the car, illuminating
first Larry's face.

A COP

stands beside the car, pointing his flashlight at the
occupants.

CoP
Can't park it here, boys.

LARRY
Yes, SIR! We'll move it, SIR!

The cop shines his light on Eddie.

EDDIE
Right away, SIR!

The cop douses his light, walks away, shaking his head.
LARRY
(continued)
Ass...HOLE!

EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
A glorious day; the Capitol Building stands proudly
against a blue sky.

INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - SIDE OFFICE - DAY

A small office adjacent to a committee room. Shannon
scans a printed statement; Collier sits nearby.

SHANNON
Who wrote it?

COLLIER
Does it matter?

SHANNON
It's nice to know who's
mouthpiece I am.

COLLIER
You're-investing in your future,
Tony.

SHANNON

Well, let's see. You've killed a
man, blown up his lab and walked
away without his secret, and you
can't put your hands on a kid
who's running around out there
without a clue. You want me to
trust in such competence?

COLLIER
Just read it, Tony.

INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - HEARING ROOM - DAY

A Senate committee hearing: a panel of Senators listens
as Shannon reads:

SHANNON
We don't know the cause of the
explosion, it's true. We don't
know the source of the
espionage, if indeed there was
espionage. But we know that we
are at risk. Every idea that
offers a competitive advantage
for Americans is subject to
theft. And that is the lesson
to be drawn from this disaster.
Security concerns must be
paramount. We must begin to
treat business secrets the way
we once treated military ones.
The cold war may be over, but we
are still at war.

SENATOR
Mr. Shannon, yours are the words
of a patriot...

EXT. LEESBURG CONSTRUCTION COMPANY - DAY

A yard brimming with trucks, vans, and at the far end, a
small office. Larry's car pulls in and parks, and Larry
and Eddie emerge, head for the office.

LARRY
I'd give my left nut for a job,
bro.

INT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE - DAY

A tough looking FOREMAN is giving Eddie and Larry a
disapproving look over:

FOREMAN
No jobs. Sorry.

LARRY
Man, how about a little
temporary work? Just a little
something...

FOREMAN
Sorry. You'd need security
clearances anyway.

LARRY
Security? What for?
FOREMAN

All our guys need clearances.
Tell your friend he oughta start

with a bath.

INT. LARRY'S CAR - DAY

Eddie and Larry are parked outside the construction yard.

LARRY
Man said no.

EDDIE
Never know. Let's
where they go.

LARRY
You da boss.

Larry pulls out behind a row
construction yard, follows.
EXT. ROAD - DAY

The trucks pull off the road

a large "No Admittance" sign
pulls up and stops along the

INT. LARRY'S CAR - DAY

Eddie and Larry watch as the

LARRY

Well, what's your idea,

trucks disappear into the

bro?

A sharp RAP on the window startles them both:

AN ARMED GUARD
has come up behind them.

LARRY
Looking for work.

Larry rolls down his window.
GUARD
Can't park here. They're hiring
down at the Leesburg yard.

LARRY
Yes, SIR! Right away, SIR!

And Larry swings around, heads back down the road. A
NOISY line of flatbed trucks, hauling huge construction
pipes and heading for the gate, makes Larry shout as he
concentrates on not getting sideswiped:

LARRY

(continued)
Ain't that the usual bitch?
Ain't hiring here, they're
hiring over there. And then you
get there and they tell you no,
it's the last place, and now you
Lost your place in line at the
last place...

And he turns to Eddie, discovers the car door open and
Eddie nowhere in sight..

LARRY
(continued)
What in the goddam...
EXT. GATE - DAY

The line of trucks enters the gate.

EXT. FLATBED TRUCK - DAY

A truck pulls to a halt beside the other trucks, near
some construction sheds. The driver crosses to a shed,
and once he passes, Eddie pokes his head out of a
construction pipe, then leaps out.

He sees a group of construction workers coming out of one
of the sheds, wearing jackets and hard hats, and he makes
his way to the door, enters.

INT. SHED - DAY

Slickers and hard hats hang on pegs; Eddie dresses. Ona
wall is a set of blueprints detailing the construction
site; Eddie takes it down, rolls it up, stuffs it under
his arm.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA - DAY

Eddie falls in with a group of workers, heading toward a
cargo elevator. As he goes, he notices that each of them
has a security identification badge. He looks down at
his own slicker: no badge.

EXT. ELEVATOR - DAY

The workers wait as a group of men exit the elevator,
apparently a shift change. Eddie awkwardly bumps into
one of the departing men:

EDDIE
Sorry. Excuse me.

Eddie has his badge. He pins it to his slicker and the
group enters the elevator cage. The elevator begins its
descent.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

The elevator cage reaches bottom and the men exit. Eddie
sneaks a look at a conveyor belt hauling rocks and earth
upward. The group moves down the tunnel to a truck.

They climb on and the truck and it heads down the long
tube.

TUNNEL - ANOTHER AREA

The men are walking again, past a huge hydraulic machine.
Eddie stops, looks it over, then unscrolls the blueprints
under his arm, tries to orient himself. When he rolls
the blueprints up again, the group has moved off, and he
is alone. He heads the other way.

TUNNEL - DOOR

Eddie comes to a huge door, blocking his progress. He
crosses to a ladder at the side of the door, climbs it,
where it gives way to a vent pipe. Eddie moves from the
ladder to the pipe and crawls through.
VENT PIPE
Eddie slips through the narrow pipe with some effort.

Ahead, a shaft of light suggests an opening. He
crawls... AND WE CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTER CENTER - DAY

a massive array of computers, run by a staff of
technicians. Just off the main room, there is a small

OFFICE
with a large window looking onto the main computer area.
Sitting before a small group of scientists is Lily.

SCIENTIST
We've been following your work
for some time. We're very
impressed.

LILY
Am I supposed to be flattered?

SCIENTIST
We'd like to check some figures
with you, if you don't mind.

SECOND SCIENTIST
Miss Naughton, we can offer you
a chance to continue the work
you've been doing with Dr. Chen.

LILY
Where is Dr. Chen?

SECOND SCIENTIST
I'm afraid he's not available.
He's quite ill.

LILY
Then let me speak to him.

SCIENTIST
We'd have to get clearance for
that.
LILY
Fine. Call me when you do.

PUMP ROOM

Eddie emerges from the vent pipe into a pump room - a
huge pumping station supplying the entire complex.
Several smaller tunnels lead off of this room; Eddie
opens a door to one of them, peers down:

P.O.V.

at the end of the tunnel, he can see workers moving past
an opening. They are lab personnel, dressed in casual
clothes. Eddie removes his slicker and hard hat, then
enters the tunnel.

SMALLER TUNNEL

with cables running the length: Eddie moves through the

tunnel as the CAMERA MOVES with him along the length of
cable and we CUT TO:

INT. - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lily is being led by a security GUARD along a corridor to
a

ROOM
which she enters. It is minimally furnished with a bed
and desk and nothing else; a door leads to a small
bathroom. She turns to the guard:
LILY
Sorry. I'd ask you in but the
place is a mess.

GUARD
Yes, Ma'am.

She closes the door in his face. AND WE CUT TO:

INTERSECTION

where the tunnel ends and a series of corridors lead in
different directions. Eddie enters from the tunnel; he
chooses a corridor and moves off.
CORRIDOR

Near the ceiling, a surveillance camera catches Eddie
unaware. We CUT TO

INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

A series of screens with odd, infra red images. One of
the screens reveals Eddie as he moves down the corridor -
an infra red picture of him that intermittently flashes a
warning sign:

UNIDENTIFIED. A security OFFICER checking the screens
picks up a phone:

OFFICER
We have an unregistered party in
corridor thirty four.

CORRIDOR

Eddie moves past doors announcing various research
projects. Through the window he can see a Saudi Prince
with a robed entourage playing with a deadly contraption.

SECURITY OFFICERS

move down another corridor, checking in rooms as they
pass.

EDDIE
rounds a corner, then stops. He is stupefied.

He is standing in the midst of a duplicate of the lab in
Chicago. It is a stunning sight.

Technicians move about, checking equipment. Eddie hears
something behind him. He wheels, finds a half dozen
armed security guards, their weapons pointing at him.

GUARD
Put your hands over your head.
Don't move...

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A war room: a world map - a mosaic of real-time
satellite images - dominates rows of empty desks and
consoles. Eddie sits under the watchful eye of a pair of
guards.

The door opens, and Shannon enters. He nods to the
guards, and they exit, leaving Shannon and Eddie alone.

SHANNON
Hello, Eddie. You did well.

EDDIE
Where's Lily?

SHANNON
Don't worry, you'll see her.
You hungry? Want something to
drink?

EDDIE
No.

Shannon crosses to him, sits.

SHANNON
How much have you figured out?

EDDIE
Only that you're a liar.

SHANNON
Partly true. The money for the
lab was coming from the CIA. I
couldn't be honest about it,
because we'd never have gotten
Bucky if he knew. I'm under
contract to them. I was
reporting our progress. I had
no idea they'd killed Bucky, and
no idea that they'd blown up the
lab.

EDDIE
They planted the money on me?

SHANNON
Yes.

EDDIE
Why?
SHANNON
You were just an accident. If
you hadn't gone back to the lab
and discovered Bucky, you might
have been left alone.

EDDIE
And Chen?

SHANNON
They needed a cover story. He
was convenient.

EDDIE
Why did they kill Bucky?

SHANNON
He's was going to make his
discovery public. It's why they
blew up the lab.

EDDIE
But they had a duplicate lab.
SHANNON
Yes.
EDDIE
From your information.
SHANNON
Yes.
EDDIE
What'll they do with Bucky's
invention?
SHANNON

Develop it. Make sure American
companies are ready for it.
Make sure they can profit from
it.

Eddie shakes his head:
EDDIE

Bucky was going to give it
away...
SHANNON
That's not the way the world
works, Eddie.

EDDIE
The world works the way we make
it work! Everything else is
bullshit!

SHANNON
The world is full of fear. Full
of greed. It's full of people
struggling for an advantage.
You still have to live in it.

EDDIE
And how do you do that?

SHANNON
You make compromises. You make
choices. Sometimes it's not
between good and bad, it's
between bad and worse. But you
still choose.

EDDIE
You lied to him. You betrayed
him, and now you're just looking
to justify it.

SHANNON
His way isn't the only way,
Eddie. Bucky was a dreamer. He
had a great way with college
kids, that's what he was good
at.

Eddie explodes:

Pause;

he

EDDIE
Then what are you good at?
Shannon. I trusted you! I
believed in you!
I made Lily trust you!

looks as if he might weep:

EDDIE
(continued)
Where is she? I want to see
her.
SHANNON
Eddie, I'm going to offer you
both a choice. They need your
help. To make Bucky's invention
work. You and Lily.

EDDIE
They can't get it to work?

SHANNON
No.

Dumb motherfuckers is what Eddie thinks. He shakes his
head.

EDDIE
What if I say no?

The doors suddenly swing open, and Collier enters,
crossing to Eddie and Shannon.

COLLIER
If you say no, Eddie, you'll
miss a chance at history.
You'll miss a chance at one of
the great discoveries of the
modern age. You'll miss a
chance at a long and prosperous
life. You and Lily. Think
about it.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A small conference room, a few chairs and a table, where
Lily sits. The door opens: Eddie stands in the corridor
with an armed guard. Lily's eyes widen with relief, then
fill with tears.

She draws him in, closes the door behind him, embraces
him tightly. Before he can speak, she puts a finger to
his lips, takes a pen and writes on the

PALM OF HER HAND

a single word: "bugged."

Eddie takes the pen, writes on

HIS OWN PALM:
"Don't trust them."

She embraces him again.

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Eddie and Lily are accompanied by Shannon and a small
group of scientists and technicians.

SCIENTIST
We understand the function of
the catalyst and the laser
application, which makes the
reaction self sustaining. But
we can't seem to control it, and
this makes the process highly
dangerous. We think the nozzle
you've built is what makes it
controllable. But for some
reason, we don't have the specs
for the nozzle, and we can't
seem to duplicate your work.

EDDIE
I want to see Chen. I can't do
it without Chen.

The scientist nods, then casts a glance at Shannon.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Eddie, Lily, Shannon and a pair of armed guards move down
a long corridor into an area marked "Hospital".

INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

The ward is equipped with two dozen beds, ready for the
disasters envisioned by Cold War planners. At the far

end, a single bed is occupied and attended by a NURSE.

Eddie, Lily, Shannon and the guards enter and cross to

the occupied bed.

CHEN

lies on the bed, his breathing aided by a an automatic
respirator, its mechanical INHALE and EXHALE EERILY LOUD.
SHANNON
How is he today?

NURSE
No change.

Lily takes Chen's hand in her own. It is nearly
imperceptible, but we can SEE Chen's hand squeeze Lily's,
twice.

LILY
Can we be alone with him? Just
for a minute?

Shannon considers. At last, he nods to the guards, and
he, the nurse and the guards exit, leaving Lily and Eddie
alone with Chen.

Eddie makes a rapid inspection of the bed, the walls, the
medicine cart nearby - no bugs. But he sees Chen's free
hand moving feebly along the bed to a spot near his
pillow. Eddie lifts the mattress just far enough.
There's the bug. And WE CUT TO:

INT. SURVEILLANCE CENTER - DAY

A security officer listens and as WE MOVE IN ON HIS
EARPHONES, WE HEAR the SOUND

of Chen's respirator, a deep, rasping inhale and exhale
and WE CUT TO...

INT. - HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

...Chen's bedside, only it's not Chen's breathing but
Eddie forcing air from an inflated hot water bottle to
simulate the raspy sound for the hidden bug as Lily bends
over Chen and listens to Chen's whispered words. And as
WE MOVE IN, we can HEAR them too: they're in Chinese.
She turns to Eddie, searching his eyes out with her
own...

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Lily emerges from the ward, crosses to Shannon, waiting
with the guards.
LILY
You bastards. Get him to a real
hospital and we'll help you.

Shannon peers into the hospital ward at Eddie, sitting
with Chen, holding onto his hand.

SHANNON
I'll see what I can do.

And we CUT TO:

MONTAGE

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

The machine shop is outfitted in a way that makes Eddie's
Chicago shop seem amateurish.

Eddie pokes through the various materials, neatly stored
on shelves as

INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

hospital personnel place Chen on a gurney and wheel him
to the corridor and

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Lily moves through the lab with Shannon, Collier and a
small group of scientists:

LILY
The laser timing?

SCIENTIST
Computer controlled, using your
data.

LILY

And auxiliary power?

SCIENTIST
Automatically, in the event of
main source failure.
LILY
I think you're using discarded
data here.

COLLIER
Can you update?

LILY
I think so.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
Eddie is at the lathe, turning his nozzle, shaping it
carefully. Two scientists watch over his shoulder as
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
Chen's gurney is loaded onto the elevator and it begins
it's ascent as
INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY
Eddie inserts the plunger into the nozzle and checks its
play: He passes the nozzle to the scientists, and while
they inspect it, we see Eddie slip a metal cylinder into

his pocket. And we

CUT TO:

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

Lily enters new data into the computers under the
watchful eye of scientists and

EXT. ELEVATOR - DAY

the elevator door opens and the hospital personnel wheel
Chen's gurney to a waiting ambulance and

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Eddie squirms under the water tank, placing the nozzle in
it's appropriate housing as Shannon, Collier and the

scientists observe. He removes the old housing, places
it on the floor beside him, and as Shannon and Collier
study the new nozzle in place, we see that the old
housing has disappeared.

INT. LUNCH ROOM - DAY

The scientists and technicians sit at a long table,
eating their cafeteria fare. At the far end of

the table, Eddie and Lily sit side by side. As always,
Lily's head is bent over a computer print out, which she
is checking with her pencil, making notes on the margins.

PRINTOUT

In the middle of her technical comments, she has scrawled
a note: "reprog okay".

EDDIE

nods, he's seen it. She overwrites the note with a
series of figures.

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - NIGHT

The lights are out, save for a few work lights that cast
eerie shadows over the equipment.

Standing in the half dark is Shannon. Thinking. He
crosses to the water tank, peers down at the nozzle,
newly installed. He runs his hand over it, but there's
no way that he can judge it's construction.

There's also no way that he can ignore his suspicions.
OFFICE AREA

Shannon is reading through a stack of computer print
outs, much like the ones we've seen Lily with.

He sits back in his chair, rubs his eyes. Then he
notices a the wastebasket nearby, filled with print outs.
Idly, he pokes through them.

PRINTOUTS
Lily's figuring on the margins. Something draws his eye

to one of the sheets: it's the note Lily has scrawled,
still legible through her overwriting.
COMPUTER CENTER

Shannon is watching as the computer spits out a series of
pages. He gathers a stack of them, sits down at a desk
and begins comparing a set of sheets with another set
already on the desk. He reads.

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - NIGHT

Shannon is in the lab, rolling his cigar back and forth
in his fingers. The door opens, and Eddie is led in by a
guard. Shannon nods to the guard.

SHANNON
Thank you.

The guard exits, leaving Eddie and Shannon alone among
the shadows.

SHANNON
You'll never get away with it.

EDDIE
with what?

He motions to a pile of computer printouts he has in his
hands.

SHANNON
I'm sure it's clever. I'm sure
it uses Lily's help.

EDDIE
I don't know what you're talking
about.

SHANNON

I don't know either, exactly.
They're not fools, you know.
They'll figure it out. Why
don't you tell me what it is?

EDDIE
Why don't you figure it out?

SHANNON
Are you that brave, Eddie? Are
you willing to risk that much?
EDDIE
Suppose we make it work. What
happens to us then?

SHANNON
They'll give you a new life.
Another name, another country,
if necessary.

EDDIE
You believe that?

SHANNON
They're not monsters. They're
just caught in a bad spot.

EDDIE
They've killed Bucky! They
destroyed his dream. It was my
dream, too.
What good would it do to get a
new life if I had to be a part
of that?

SHANNON
You have a lot to live for,
Eddie. You're like a son to me.
I never had a family, so I made
one up. You and Chen and Lily,
everyone at the lab. And Bucky,
like a crazy old uncle.

EDDIE
You threw it away. Don't you
understand? You threw it away!

SHANNON
You don't always get what you
want.

EDDIE
You lied! You want me to do the
same thing.

SHANNON
I want you to understand. I
wish I could make you.

EDDIE
You already have.
And their eyes meet and hold. Shannon's seem to harbor a
deep sadness.

EXT. TUNNEL EXIT - DAY

Workers emerge from the elevator as the next shift
prepares to descend.

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Collier, Shannon, and a group of scientists cluster
together as the technicians busy themselves with a test.
Not far away are Eddie and Lily.

SCIENTIST
Main power.

The odd hum of machinery again. In the tank, small
bubbles appear at the edges of the electrodes.

SCIENTIST
(continued)
Injector...

EDDIE AND LILY
move, as if by instinct, closer to one another. Eddie
slips his hand around Lily's; their fingers tighten
together, then intertwine. A BELL RINGS as
SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS

slip dark glasses over their eyes.

SCIENTIST
Laser...

The laser glows, bouncing its beams off the mirrors.
The water tank begins to shudder as the water roils.

SCIENTIST
(continued)
Cavitation sound waves...

A Technician at the console moves a control forward and
the

NOZZLE
hums, turning the water blue.
SHANNON AND COLLIER

cross to the tank, watch, expectantly, as the shuddering
continues. A long moment as Collier peers down at the
nozzle. He turns to Shannon, consternation growing.

SHANNON
Wait.

He's seen this before. He turns to Eddie, stares hard at
him, then back to the tank, which is shuddering
dangerously now. And Shannon knows:

SHANNON
(continued)
Shut it down.

TECHNICIAN

draws the main power switch to its off position. The hum
of machinery dies. In the silence that follows, Shannon
turns to Eddie again:

SHANNON
Eddie...

But before he can add another word, the hum suddenly
returns, and the roiling of water in the tank increases.

SHANNON
(continued)
Shut it down!

TECHNICIAN
It is down!

He maneuvers the master switch, but the hum and the
shuddering in the tank seem to grow.

TECHNICIAN
(continued)
It's not responding!

SHANNON
Eddie!

But Eddie is already moving, toward Collier, something in
his hand, shiny, metallic...
He grabs Collier, holds the object to Collier's temple
and now we can see what it is-a crudely shaped, lethal
looking pistol, fashioned from spare parts in the machine
shop.

EDDIE
Pull the alarm!

No one moves.

EDDIE
(continued)
Pull the alarm!

He cocks the hammer.

COLLIER
Do what he says:

A technician crosses to the emergency alarm, pulls the
switch. A loud WAILING SIREN suddenly adds its noise to
the shuddering tank.

EDDIE
Get these people out of here.
Clear the tunnel!

SHANNON
Eddie!

EDDIE
Do it!

COLLIER

Do it! All of you!

The scientists and technicians head for the doors.

EDDIE
Lily...

LILY
Eddie, no...

EDDIE

Time to go, Lily. Get out.

SHANNON
It won't work, Eddie.
EDDIE
You want to take a chance?

He points the pistol at Shannon.

COLLIER
What do you mean?

SHANNON
He's bluffing. I don't think he
has any ammunition in that
thing.

Eddie returns the pistol to Collier's temple.

EDDIE
Shall we demonstrate?

COLLIER
Tony, for Christ sake!

Shannon reaches into his coat, draws out a small
automatic pistol. He crosses to Lily, hold the
gun to her.

SHANNON
Go ahead. Let's see what's real
here.
EDDIE
Let her go.
SHANNON
Shoot, Eddie.
COLLIER
Don't shoot!
SHANNON
On three, Eddie. One... two...
COLLIER

Shannon; goddamit

SHANNON
Last call, Eddie.

Eddie drops his pistol to the floor. Collier lets out a
long breath, mops the sweat from his forehead.
COLLIER
Make him shut the damn thing
down.

SHANNON
How do we do it, Eddie?

EDDIE
Guess.

SHANNON
I've already guessed. You're
using auxiliary power. Lily,
isn't that right?
You reprogrammed the computer so
that when the main power was
shut down, it would read as a
power failure. Very smart. So
all we have to do is shut down
the back up!

LILY
It doesn't matter what you do.
This whole thing is worthless,
anyway.
You might as well let it blow.

SHANNON
Why, Lily?

LILY
Because Bucky was smarter than
all of you. He knew someone was
Stealing his information, so he
kept part of the data secret.
Not even Chen knew what it was.
The stuff you were sending to
this lab had a missing element,
and only Bucky knew it. And you
killed him.

SHANNON
The goose that laid the golden
egg. What about it, George?

COLLIER
I think they're lying.

SHANNON
I don't think so. Not this
time.
Collier crosses to a phone.

SHANNON
(continued)
What are you doing?

COLLIER
I'm getting the power shut down.

SHANNON
I wouldn't do that.

COLLIER
What do you mean?

He looks up to find Shannon's pistol pointed at him.

SHANNON
Get out, Eddie. Lily.

COLLIER
Are you mad?

SHANNON
Eddie, do me a favor. Pick up
that phone and call 911. Tell
them you want Agent Ford from
the FBI here.

COLLIER
Tony, don't be stupid...

SHANNON
Shut up, George. Go on, Eddie,
make the call.

EDDIE
We can all get out...

SHANNON
Make the call!

Eddie crosses to the phone, dials:

EDDIE
We've got an emergency here.
We'd like you to get Agent
Raymond Ford from the FBI...

EDDIE
Shannon!
SHANNON
Good, Eddie. Now go.

No mistaking his intent; Eddie grabs Lily by the hand and
they run. Shannon crosses to the hydrogen holding tank
still holding his pistol on Collier. He opens the valve,
and deadly hydrogen gas spills into the lab with a loud
HISS...

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Eddie and Lily burst through the doors to the lab and
head for the elevator. But rounding a corner and looking
up, they see the

ELEVATOR

loaded with lab and security personnel, ascending to the
surface.

EDDIE
This way!

They turn, race down the tunnel as
SECURITY GUARDS
from the lab area recognize Eddie and Lily:

GUARD
Don't let them get away!

They chase, one of the guards barking into his radio
ANOTHER PART OF TUNNEL

...asS Eddie and Lily reach a concrete form: they are
blocked by another pair of guards. Eddie grabs Lily's
hand, leads her down a narrow space between the wall and
the concrete form, barely wide enough for them pass.

EDDIE AND LILY

Inch their way forward. It's a tight, claustrophobic
squeeze, and Lily has to fight her panic.

EDDIE
Hold on... hold on...

He gives her his hand, tries to reassure her as
A GUARD
follows them into the space, a short way behind.
TUNNEL

Another guard, seeing Eddie and Lily behind the form,
throws the compression controls; the hydraulic arm starts
to move and the form closes to the walls as

EDDIE AND LILY

can barely edge forward, the space growing smaller and
smaller, the stuff of nightmares:

LILY
Eddie! I can't...

And at the last moment, Eddie clears the form, pulling
Lily with him. They leap down to the tunnel floor as

THE GUARD

following them through the narrow space is crushed, his
blood seeping down the wall below like an ugly paint.

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY
Shannon holds Collier at bay with his pistol.

SHANNON
Well, George, we're in a real
pickle, aren't we? If I shoot,
you're dead. But the shot would
set this whole place off, so I'm
dead, too. What are we gonna
do?

COLLIER
I don't know, Tony. Why don't
you put the gun down?

SHANNON
It's sort of like the arms race,
isn't it? What was the phrase?
Mutually Assured Destruction?

COLLIER
Yes, that's it.
Collier is sweating profusely.

SHANNON
What do you say we negotiate?
COLLIER
Yes, that's fine. That's a good
idea.
SHANNON

We'll both make a full
confession of how we happen to
be here. You write how it was
that Bucky died. I'll write how
it was I've been lying to
Congress. Then we'll exchange
confessions. I'll have yours
and you'll have mine. That way,
we'll each be protected if the
other decides to go to the FBI.
Is that fair?

COLLIER
Tony, I'm going to turn around
and walk out of here. You,
won't shoot.
Shannon cocks the pistol, loudly.

SHANNON
Are you certain?

Collier finds himself staring down the barrel of the
pistol.

COLLIER
You are mad.

Shannon places his pen on the table between them.
SHANNON
We have some paper here, don't
we?
INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Eddie and Lily race toward the conveyor belt, carrying
crushed rock upward from the tunnel to the surface.
EDDIE
Get on it:

She turns to him as if he's crazy:

EDDIE
(continued)
Lily, get on!

And he practically has to put her on it himself, before
leaping on behind her.

EDDIE
Get down!

GUARDS

chasing the two of them race past the conveyor belt and
on down the tunnel.

CONVEYOR BELT

Eddie and Lily ride the belt. Lily, ahead, looks
forward, sees that the rocks are being carried
toward a compressor. She turns, shouts:

LILY
Eddie!

And now, Eddie sees it too. He turns, looks behind him:
a guard has seen him on the belt. He jumps on, begins
moving up the belt toward Eddie and Lily. As he closes
in, Eddie notices a pipe stretching across the conveyor
belt:

EDDIE
Grab onto the pipe!
LILY turns, she is closing on the pipe:

EDDIE
Lily!

Can she do it? She reaches out, grabs for the pipe, but
her hand slips off. The belt carries her just beyond and
she turns and tries again - this time, she manages to
hold on:

Behind her, Eddie approaches the pipe. He reaches for it
and the two of them now hang side by side as

THE GUARD
riding the belt behind them approaches, trying to aim his
weapon at them. But the belt is unsteady and he can't
quite manage as he draws closer and closer and

EDDIE

holding onto the pipe, swings his boot at the guard,
catching him flush on the jaw and the guard goes down
onto the conveyor belt and is carried up toward the
compressor as

LILY

watches, over her shoulder, finally turns away, can't
bear to look as the guard is... compressed.

EDDIE AND LILY

make their way, hand over hand, away from the moving belt
until they are clear and can jump down onto the tunnel
floor. They run...

INT. DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Collier is finished writing. He puts Shannon's pen down.
Shannon picks up the paper and reads. And while he
reads, he chats:

SHANNON
You love science, George?

COLLIER
Very much. Yes.

He speaks to Shannon as if Shannon has lost his mind.
SHANNON
So do I. We could have been
famous. One of the great
discoveries of the modern age,
indeed. It's not enough, is it?

COLLIER
What isn't enough?

SHANNON
Science, George. It doesn't
make us better people. This is
excellent.
The HISS of the hydrogen leak seems like a howl now. The
water tank shudders with such force that a metal tipped
strap breaks loose, slams with great force against the
floor, again and again.

SHANNON
(continued)
That looks very dangerous.

Shannon folds the paper neatly, puts it in his pocket.

SHANNON
(continued)
Bucky was right, wasn't he? We
need new ways of being human.

COLLIER
Aren't you going to write your
confession?

SHANNON
Actually, I've change my mind.

And as Collier watches with growing alarm, Shannon coolly
rises and crosses toward the door.

COLLIER
Shannon!

EXT. TUNNEL - DAY

Eddie and Lily emerge from the tunnel into the daylight.
The RADIATION ALARM is still screaming as lab personnel
and construction workers scramble for safety. Eddie and
Lily join in the throng, running for the perimeter of the
site as

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE FACILITY - DAY

Agent Ford pulls up in his car and stops, gets out and
watches agape as the mob runs toward him.

INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE DUPLICATE LAB - DAY

Shannon runs for the huge submarine doors, now open at
the end of the tunnel. Behind him, Collier chases:

COLLIER
Shannon, for god's sake...
Shannon leaps through the doors, turns, manages to stare

into Collier's frantic eyes just before he slams the huge
doors shut. He grabs some construction rods piled by the
doors, inserts them through the door handles so that they
bar the door from opening.

OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS

Collier frantically presses the automatic controls,
trying to open the doors. They shudder, but the force of
the construction bars is too strong and the doors don't
open.

Collier races for the lab.
DUPLICATE LAB

as Collier enters. The loosened strap is banging with
incredible force now and it makes Collier stop in his
tracks. He's agonized, doesn't know where to turn. At
last, he crosses to the strap, hoping to grab it and
prevent it from striking a surface when his eyes widen in
horror and the

STRAP

bangs against the metal form of the water tank and the
tiniest spark flies into the thickening air and WE CUT
TO:

EXT. SECRET FACILITY - DAY

Workers streaming out of the site, onto the road, in
pickup trucks, on foot, Lily and Eddie among them and as

Ford sees them, the ground beneath them suddenly shudders
and WE CUT TO:

OVERHEAD SHOT

as a giant sinkhole is created from the explosion below,
dust and debris rising as after a powerful earthquake and

EDDIE AND LILY
can only hold onto each other in the confusion and
hysteria that follows as they make their way across the

rumbling earth to Agent Ford and safety...

And we DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PLEASURE BOAT - DAY

A modestly appointed sloop afloat on what must be the
blue green waters of the Caribbean. In the rear of the
boat is a figure in a captain's hat and white ducks, feet
up on the rail, writing on a small steno pad. It's
Shannon, and we HEAR HIM, VOICE OVER:

SHANNON
Eddie... delighted to read of
your return to work. Hope all
is well. I'11l be in touch.
Tony.

He calls into the cabin:

SHANNON
(continued)
Where's my first mate?

Florence appears carrying two drinks. He slips his arm
around her waist, hands her the paper from the Steno pad.

SHANNON
(continued)
Send this when we reach port.

FLORENCE
Send it yourself, you big lug.
She hands him his drink and kisses him lightly, on the
lips. And they settle in for the sunset.

END CREDITS.
