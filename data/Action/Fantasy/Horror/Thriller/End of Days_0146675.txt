wand it is written that when God made Man in
his image, he asked the angels to bow down
before his greatest creation. One amongst
them refused, and for that sin, Lucifer the
Angel of Light, was cast from God’s grace,
and imprisoned in the darkness of Hell.

But once every thousand years, when the
stars are right, Lucifer ig freed from his
prison seeking vengeance against Man. If he
can cross the threshold of Hell with his
chosen mortal bride, he shall be given
reign over earthly souls and all mankind
will be damned.”

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
The New York City daylight shines down on OUR LADY OF MERCY
HOSPITAL.
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY
A woman lies in stirrups, breathing rhythmically. Her husband
squeezes her hand while the obstetrician kneels between her
legs.
OB/GYN

Push... that's it. Push.
With a final push, the woman tenses her entire body and a
moment later the cry of a newborn fills the roon.

, OB/GYN (cont ‘d)

It's a girl. .
The cheerful NURSE gingerly wrapa the baby in a blanket and
presents it to the mother. ‘

MOTHER
Sho's... she's so beautiful.

Tears of joy £111 the mother's eyes as the NEW FATHER kisses
his wife on the forehead. They both beam at the miracle.

NURSE
I must take her down for her clean-
up, now.

WOMAN
No please. Not yet.

Oh, it's procedure. We'll have her
back to you before you know it.

The Nurse takes the baby from the room.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

The Nurse walks past the sick and dying. She clutches the
baby to her bosom as it were her own. Just before the
elevators, the Nurse ducks into the stairway.
Yy

INT. STAIRWAY - DAY

Darkness fills the stairwell as the Nurse descends... flight
after flight. Until it ends.

She pushes through a door, into a...
Dark corridor
«+. and with the crying baby she turns into...

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Sheet covered cadavers lie on metal slabs. FACELESS MEN,
wearing HOODED ROBES, gather in a small circle in the center
of the room. One of them, the HEAD PRIEST, steps forward and
takes the baby from the nurse. |

The room is lit by the glow of candles arranged in a...
Pentagram

The Head Priest unwraps the newborn girl and places her in
the center of the Satanic symbol.

HEAD PRIEST
To him, we commit your body. To him,
we commit your soul.

The Head Priest opens a box and removes a snake. He holds the
snake high, showing it to the others. Then he takes a silver
Gagger and cuts the snake open. It writhes as its blood drips
ento the baby.

HEAD PRIEST (cont'd)
You are promised to him. You are
given to him. You shall open the
gates and build him a temple on Earth. —

The Head Priest smears the blood of the snake on the
newborn's face and brings his bleod soaked fingers to rest in
the baby girl's mouth.

HEAD PRIEST (cont'd)
You are chosen.

. She suckles the fingers.

HEAD PRIEST (cont'd)
: (whispering)
You have tasted him. And now you are
his and you will hunger for hin.

The snake ignites into a flash of flame and disappears.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT -_

The Nurse walks back down the linoleum, clutching the baby.
She turns into...

THE MATERNITY WARD
and hands the little girl back over to her mother's arms.

NURSE
Here she is, all clean and fresh.
Have you thought of a name yet?

MOTHER
Christine. Her name's Christine.

NURSE
Happy Birthday, Christine.

EXT. VATICAN CITY - NIGHT

The majestic towers of the Vatican rise high into the night,
their shadowy faces lit from the glow of street lamps below.
The moon, not yet full, hangs low in the sky. But something's
@ifferent. Above the moon is a FAINT ARC of some kind.

In the window of one of the tower rooms, candle light a
flickers and a shadow moves across the pane of glass.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

Monastically spare - a wooden chair, table and bed. Open on
the table is an ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT. Beautiful lettering
adorns its worn parchment pages, and a rich illustration
leaps off the opposing page. The shadow moves across the
page. A Monk takes his seat at the table.

: MONK
All my life have I watched the skies,
waiting for the sign.

The monk points to the illustration in the manuscript. The
full moon hangs low in the sky. Across the top of the moon is
a comet, its tail sweeping in an arc over the glowing orb.
The effect is that of a giant eye. Beneath it, a child lies
inside a Pentagran.

MONK (cont'd)
(reading)
Under the eye of God the child is
born. She shall be marked by darkness.

. “
 

4.

Another SHADOW moves in the candle lit room. His vestments
rustle as he moves to the window balcony, stepping out into
the night air. Above him in the sky, THE VERY SAME SIGN. A .
comet arcing over the moon.

MONK (cont'd)
Your Holiness, there can be no doubt.
It has begun.

The shadow figure steps into the light. We see by his
vestments that he is indeed THE POPE.

POPE
Send emissaries out to all the cities
ef the world. She must be found.

In the shadows we see other religious leaders of all faithes.
They murmur amongst themselves. One among them, a CARDINAL,
steps forward.
CARDINAL
She must be destroyed. Let me convene
the knights.
POPE
If we sacrifice the innocent we do
not deserve to be redeemed.
The Monk turns the page of the manuscript. In the next
illumination, the Knight on the cliff is now surrounded by
fire. A Young Girl in rags is curled around his feet. The
knight's SWORDTIP points at THE DEVIL.

"New York City - Present Day"

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY .

A HOMELESS MAN prays to an open sewer hole churning out

steam. SIRENS blare in the background. POLICE MOTORCYCLES
pass by. Behind them a MOTORCADE -- half a dozen cars.
The homeless man looks up at the sky. A dark shadow falls
across his face, as a HELICOPTER SWOOPS overhead.

Along the helicopter’s side...
"HUNTER PRIVATE SECURITY"

HELICOPTER PILOT (V.0.)
This is Hunter One. Rooftops 125 to
136 are clear.

JERICHO (V.0.)
Keep them clear.

We swoop lower, singling out one of the limousines in the
motorcade.

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

JERICHO scans the crowd with his strong piercing eyes and the
mo nonsense attitude of a samurai. He and the three other
armed men in this limo are all dressed in dark business
suits, looking very much like Secret Service Agents, right
down to the radio earpiece in their ears. Jericho raises his
cuff and speaks into the small microphone sewn there.

JERICHO
Hunter Two, do you copy?

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

This black tar roof looks like it hasn't seen maintenance
since the WPA. Bracketed to building's edge, fifteen foot
letters extend high above us telling any New Yorker who
bothers to look up that once-upon-a-time this was...

THE BLUE ANGEL HOTEL.

A HELICOPTER rises above the edge of the building and circles
the rooftop perimeter.

-HELICOPTER PILOT TWO
Hunter Two, we copy.

In the open door of the chopper, a Commando scans the roof
with a spectral scope. No signs of heat, movement, or life.

HELICOPTER PILOT TWO (cont'd)
Sector One is clear.

JERICHO (V.0.)
Copy Two. ETA Three minutes. High
alert and counting down.
HELICOPTER PILOT TWO

Copy that.
Hunter Two veers away from the rooftop and pulls into tha sky.
A few heartbeats later, a SLIGHT CLICKING SOUND catches our
attention. It's coming from the L in BLUE. The bottom panel
of the letter drops down, and out slides a figure, his outfit
the same dark asphalt black as the rooftop.
With lightning efficiency the man in black pops open a small
black case and removes a gunstock and several sections of a

gun barrel. If we guessed it was a high power sniper rifle,
we wouldn't be wrong.

EXT. STREET - DAY
The motorcade cruises past, heading toward...

The UNITED NATIONS BUILDING
The very symbol of mankind's best intentions.

mvt. LIMOUSINE - DAY

Through the window, Jericho scans the crowd for anything out
of the ordinary.
JERICHO
Weapons check.
He and the three other men remove their handguns from their
holsters, check their loads and release safeties. One of the

men, a goateed wisecracker named CHICAGO, late thirties, re-
holsters his weapon and speaks into his mic.

CHICAGO —_
Python on approach. We are at Alert
Five. Cue the Potentate. He's on.
EXT. UNITED NATIONS BUILDING - DAY
The motorcade pulls to a halt between crowds of people.
.JERICHO and CHICAGO spring from the first limo and cross to

the door of the second. The rest of the security contingent
take up point positions, all eyes scanning the crowd.

JERICHO
(into cuff mic)
We're exposed.
7.

Jericho opens the door. A Diplomat steps out and crosses to
the crowd. Shakes hands. Jericho scans the crowd. A gun
barrel? No, it's an umbrella.

Then he checks nearby rooftops. Thinks he sees something on
one of them. No. Just a shadow. Scans nearby windows.

From one window, he sees a GLINT of light. He squints. It's
not coming from the window, it's a reflection of something on
the roof across the way.

An untrained observer wouldn't notice, a highly trained
observer would probably miss it. Jericho doesn't. His head
snaps around to the rooftop, but sees nothing once again. But
he senses something.

JERICHO (cont'd)
(into cuff)
Hunter Two, Reoftop Southwest Corner.

HELICOPTER P.O.V. - Looking down on the Rooftop. All we can
see is the black of the roof.

HUNTER TWO
Rooftop negative.

ON THE GROUND - Jericho runs .toward the Diplomat.

JERICHO
(into cuff)
You're wrong. Shooter! Evac! Evac!

Security swings into action. Guns are drawn. Jericho grabs
the Diplomat and pulls him toward the Limo.

GUNSHOTS! Jericho turns, and his suit jacket EXPLODES four
times as the ROUNDS HIT HIM squarely in the chest. As he goes
down, he shoves the Diplomat into the limo, slamming the door.

THE LIMOUSINE ACCELERATES knocking Jericho aside as it flies
through its pre-planned emergency escape route.

JERICHO (cont'd)
(gasping into mic)
Drive One. Status!
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
eee as it accelerates down the street. The driver glances in
his mirror at the anxious Diplomat. No bullet wounds though.

DRIVE ONE
Shaken, not stirred. Using secure
south entrance. .
,)

EXT. STREET - DAY

CEICAGO pushes through the crowd to Jericho, who lies
motionless on the cement.

CHICAGO
Oh, shit.

Chicago crouches and fingers the bullet holes in Jericho's
jacket. .

CHICAGO (cont'd)
How many times have I told you not to
* wear your good suits to work.
Jericho stirs. Chicago helps him to his feet.

Jericho pulls off his jacket. Beneath it... A Kevlar vest
with four bullets imbedded in its surface.

JERICHO
Where's the shooter?

CHICAGO
Cornered on the rooftop.
JERICHO ~
- Then what are we doing down here?

UNITED NATIONS - SOUTHWEST CORNER
Jericho and Chicago race toward the descending helicopter.
They don't break stride as they jump on the hood, then roof
of an NYPD patrol car, surprising the hell out of the officer
inside. The helicopter doesn't even touch down as Jericho and
Chicago climb onboard. It lifts off immediately.
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
The shooter holds position behind the scaffolding rails
holding up the letters. He shoulders his rifle, taking SHOTS
at the HELICOPTERS flying around hin.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Jericho and Chicago look out the side window, down at the
Shooter. The Sheoter swings his rifle toward them and FIRES.

The glass on the WINDOW EXPLODES as it's hit by a round.
Jericho and Chicago pull out their sidearms, lean out the

broken window and FIRE at the shooter. The Shooter snakes
back into the girdirons.
JERICHO
Get us closer.
ExT. SKY - DAY
The helicopter pulls up and circles around.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

The Shooter aims at the helicopter and squeezes off a FEW
ROUNDS. But Jericho's RETURN FIRE forces him into the open.
The Shooter fires again, but he's out of ammo. He runs, but...

The HELICOPTER descends in front of him, cutting him off.
Nowhere to go. The Shooter checks his options, glancing at
the edge of the building. As Jericho exits the helicopter,
gun drawn, the Shooter turns tail and runs toward the edge of
the building.

JERICHO jumps back onto the akid of the chopper. He yells to
the pilot.

JERICHO
+ Pollow!

The pilot complies. Chicago leans out the window.

CHICAGO
He's gonna pancake himself.

JERICHO
(to Pilot)
Faster!
The helicopter skims low and fast after the shooter. Jericho
stands, perched on the skid, his arm outstretched, ready to
grab the Shooter.

The Shooter's not letting up, running as fast as he can
toward oblivion. The helicopter closes on him quickly.

Jericho reaches out -his arm, just a few feet away from the
Shooter. Closing in. His fingertips almost touching. But...

THE ROOF ENDS

THE SHOOTER SUNPS...

JERICHO GRABS for him...
Catches a handful of fabric...
10.

The helicopter zooms over the edge, leaving Jericho staring
down at the dizzying sight of a hundred story drop, holding
the SHOOTER by the scruff of his shirt. .

JERICHO (cont'd)
Got him!

The Shooter turns. Raises a handgun at Jericho. Jericho's
eyes widen as the hammer pulls back. There's only one thing
he can do...

LET GO!

HE DOES.

THE SHOOTER PLUMMETS, continuing to fire.

Jericho can't believe what he's just done. Chicago pulls him
back into the helicopter.

CHICAGO
Better him than you, man.
EXT. SKY - DAY
The Shooter continues to fall, accelerating.

Then a streamer pops from his back...

Int. HELICOPTER - DAY
Jericho looks down at the plummeting Shooter.
JERICHO

He's got silk! Son-of-a-bitch's got

silk.
EKtT. SKY - DAY
Between the canyons of tall buildings a PARACHUTE BLOSSOMS.
Stunned New Yorkers look up in awe as the Man in Black
PARAGLIDES right down 42nd street.
“INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
Jericho checks his sidearm and grits his teeth.

JERICHO
Down.
ai.

EXT. SKY - DAY

The helicopter descends between the buildings chasing after
the chute. The Shooter pulls his steering lines and
accelerates toward mid-town.

INT. HELICOPTER ~ DAY

Jericho bangs on the wall of the cabin.

JERICHO
Lower...

HELICOPTER PILOT
Siz, I can't land a helicopter in the
middle of a crowded street.

JERICHO
I didn't ask you to land.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A CABBIE watches through his window as the Shooter glides
down the biock toward him.

When he's about ten feet from the ground, the Shooter cuts
his chute. He plummets onto the roof of the cab.

CABBIE
Hoy! Asshole. You batter have
collision.

The Shooter leapfrogs across cars toward a subway entrance.

As the Cabbie turns back around, he sees a helicopter descend
on him. Jericho poised at the door. As soon as the helicopter
is close enough to the ground, JERICHO JUMPS... hits the top
of oo sees the Shooter disappear into the dark hole of

He climbs down the side of the bus.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Against the protesting shouts of an MTA worker, Jericho jumps
the turnstile, his gun drawn. He races through the crowded
subway platform pushing commuters aside.

As he gets to the platform's edge, he sees the Shooter
disappearing into the darkness cf the subway tunnel.

Without a moments hesitation, Jericho jumps down on the
tracks, sprinting after the Shooter.
12.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

Jericho races through venting steam and dirty pools of water.
A hush falls on the tunnel. He hears whispers all around him.

‘VOICES
Jericho... Jericho....

The sharp SNAP of TWO GUNSHOTS sends him diving for cover. He
blindly returns fire down the tunnel. He listens a moment and
steps back into the open, moving stealthily, like a cat.

As he edges down the tunnel, the walls begin to glow with A
DEEP ROCKING CRIMSON and then slowly OOZE INTO FLAME.

The length of the tunnel becomes an abyss of swirling fire
and DESPERATE CRIES OF PAIN ring in our ears. The Shooter
steps into the open and turns toward Jericho, his face BLACK
AS SOOT, his eyes BURNING RED. His dark voice bellows over
the roar of the flame.

SHOOTER
Heed ma, Jericho. The thousand years
are over. The Dark Angel will be
leosed from his prison and the Gates
. of Damnation will open between Kell
and Earth. .

JERICHO
Get down on the ground! Hands behind
your head!

SHOOTER
You are powerless to stop it.

Jericho stares at the terrifying inferno and the dark shadow
down the barrel of his sidearm. The Shooter stalks toward
Jericho.

JERICHO
Stay back... I said STAY BACK!

Jericho changes the angle of his shot and fires twice.
Suddenly the tunnel GOES DARK.

The Shooter screams and falls to the ground. Everything's
back to normal, except Jericho has blown two holes in the
Shooter's left leg. Jericho looks around, locking for the
light show, wondering what the hell it was.

Footsteps behind him. Chicago and the NYPD coming to the
rescue. They blow by Jericho and swarm the Shooter, cuffing
_hdm and reciting Miranda.
13.

CHICAGO
Hey, you okay? You look like you saw
a ghost.

Indeed he has. He walks over to the Shooter. Gone is the
smoldering face and raging eyes.

JERICHO
Much worse.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

A sea of blue as New York's finest clear the station. The
Shooter is loaded up onto a stretcher. He tries to speak but
only unformed sounds escape his lips. DETECTIVE FRANCIS, 50s,
gruff NYPD, crosses to Jericho.

DTC. FRANCIS
Sorry, man. Whatever you thought he
said... Couldn't have been him.

JERICHO
Why's that?

: DTC. FRANCIS

Guy's got no tongue:
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER
Jericho searches the walls up and down.

CHICAGO

If it makes you feel any better, I

waw a UFO once at summer camp.
Jericho ignores him. Train rumbles echo from a distance.

JERICHO
This was real. I don't fantasize.

CHICAGO
But, there's nothing here.

Jericho touches the charred old walls of the subway tunnel,
rubs his fingers together.

JERICHO
There was.
14.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

Dark THUNDERHEADS roll ever the towering skyscrapers. Angry.
billows spitting down shafts of LIGHTNING.
Deep echoes of rumbling thunder roll up and down the avenues.

EXT. CITY - NIGHT

A quiet block of brownstones, darkly silent on this night.
with the exception of far away flashes and distant rumblings.
The blacktop on the street SHAKES, starts to CRACK.

A terrifying rumble as the earth tears open.

A WALL OF FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE CRACK. The entire block is
swallowed by flame. Windows blow out. A GIANT TONGUE OF FIRE
reaches high up to heaven... as if hell itself had erupted.

The wall of flames swirl down the streets and in the flames
we see A SHAPE, perhaps a monstrous wing, perhaps a giant
talon stepping forward, all covered by a shroud of fire. The
shape pushes further and further out until the fire parts and
out of the fireball steps...

A MAN

Handsome, elegant, aged, yet ageless... there is something
about him that is immediately frightening.

He looks around as if seeing the world for the very first
time. He takes a deep breath of air, removes a silver case
from his jacket, pulls out a cigarette. He takes a drag and
the cigarette IGNITES into a flame ON ITS OWN. The whole
block is in flames behind him, casting his long dark shadow
down the street.

From a dark alley, we see a homeless man, an ALBINO, peering
out the terrifying scene. He turns and runs. —_

As THUNDER CRACKS, rattling windows, Jericho bolts straight
up in bed, breathing hard.

ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING and the first thing we notice is
_the glass. Great wide windows. Great wide sky-lights looking
up to the heavens. The city stretches around us for 360
degrees. A flash of lightning illuminates the room and we
wee that the apartment is very spare. No art, minimal.
furniture.

Jericho clicks the light on. We can see large welts stretch
across his chest where the bullets hit. He checks the bruises
and when he touches one he winces.
15.

He rises and crosses to the window. On the night table is a “™)
single picture in a frame of Jericho, much younger, a woman
and young boy.

The storm outside intensifies and suddenly THE LIGHTS GO OUT.
DARKNESS.

A match is struck. Jericho brings the flame to light a
candle. But the candle's blown out. He lights it again. Again
it dies. He tries again, holding the match on the flame.

CRASH! Glass shatters. A rush of wind. The candle and match
blow out.

In flashes of lightning, we see that the driving winds have
blown one of his windows open. The wind billows into his room.

Another flash of lightning and he sees a WOMAN (not the one

in the picture) standing near him... ARMS OUTSTRECHED...

PLEADING.

Darkness again.

Jericho crosses to the window and pushes it shut.

He hears SIRENS outside. He crosses to the window, and

peering out, he sees FLAMES lick the sky a half-mile away and ~”)
hears the wailings of police and fire trucks. :
INT. LOBBY, THE PLAZA - HOTEL

The MAN crosses the Lobby to the front desk. The NIGHT CLERK,
a very elegant woman in her twenties, forces a smile.

CLERK
May I help you, sir?

The Man looks deep into the clerk's eyes. She sways a bit as
if swooning. He nods at her and she slides a key to hin.

MAN
Thank you.

The Man touches the girl's hand and then strokes her face.

MAN (cont ‘d)
Come up in twenty minutes.

The girl watches him walk away, her eyes change, darkening.
16.

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE/THE PLAZA - NIGHT

The Man stands before all of New York City overlooking the |
twinkling lights and gaps of darkness. He sniffs.

Something foul.

ANGLE ON ~ The bedside table. The Man sniffs again. He slides
the drawer open and removes a Gideon Bible. He holds it in
his hand and squeezes. BLOOD drips down from the Book and
runs down the Man‘s hand. Moments later it BURSTS INTO FLAME.
The Man doesn't seem to mind the fire as The Bible quickly
turns to smoke.

In the background we see the Hotel Clerk enter the room.

CLERK
I'm bere for you.

She begins to undress. The Man throws a backward glance at
her.

MAN
Call a friend... or two.

the smoke from the Bible drifts into the air dissolving
Ores .

i EXT. NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

No sign of last night's storm, RED DAWN breaks over Central
Park. But the dawn is a little too red. As if the clouds were
soaked in blood.

MORNING RADIO (V.0O)
And it's another scorcher here in the
Big Apple, or should I say the
rotting apple. Temperatures are
expected to hit a record ninety. two
@egrees. We're gonna have one blister
of a New Year's Eve in Times Square.

Jericho ducks into a busy deli and approaches the counter.
News Radio is on in the background.

MORNING RADIO (V.0)
And heap it on, a gas main erupted in
Bell's Kitchen last night sending

STAN WEISMANN, the Deli Man, blood stains across his apron,
-_ grins through his bad teeth at Jericho.
17.

WEISMANN
Jericho. Saw you in the paper. Save
another life?

Weismann hands Jericho his usual.

JERICHO
ZI don't save anyone. I keep them from
dying of unnatural causes. How's
Helen doing in this heat?

In the background, a frightened ALIBINO YOUNG MAN watches
Jericho, starts moving toward him.

WEISMANN
She's okay. She loves to bitch about
the leg.

JERICHO

Tell her I miss her coffee.

7 WEISMANN
You're the only one.

The ALBINO grabs Jericho and looks deep into his eyes,
pleading.

ALBINO
Find the girl! You must protect her!

Suddenly WEISMANN convulses. He leaps the deli counter
growling and grabs the young man by the throat, strangling
him, smashing his head through the glass in the meat counter.

JERICHO
Hey. HEY!

Jericho tries to pull the two apart. Weissman throws Jericho
back with bestial strength, his voice otherwordly.

WEISHANN
The righteous shall be destroyed.

JERICHO
Let him go!

Jericho grabs Weismann who writhes like a man possesed. The
Albino breaks free... and sprints toward the window of the
deli. He leaps through it, SHATTERING THE GLASS, and
disappears into the crowded New York sidewalk.

Weismann grabs at Jericho and slashes at him with his hands.
For a second the hands look different, like claws or talons
as they rip into Jericho's suit sleeve. Jericho shoves the

him back, and Weismann runs after the Albino. -

Jericho runs after them, but...

ON THE SIDEWALK

He sees no sign of them. Jericho looks down at the rip in his
Sleeve. No human hand could've done that.

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE/THE PLAZA - MORNING

Light leaks through the curtains and we see bodies writhing
dn the bed. In the darkness, the forms suggest several nude
women. One figure arises among them... the MAN.

MAN
It's good to be back.

He crosses to a closet door, opens it, revealing a long row
of suits. He picks one out. A nude girl comes over to him and
rubs her hand along his chest. He puts his hand on her head.

MAN (cont'd)
Go into the city. Find the girl and
bring her to me.

GIRL
Perhaps I am the one.

The Man strokes the girl's body.

MAN
If it were only as easy as you are.

. GIRL
What's so special about this "girl?"

MAN
Nothing. That's the beauty of it. It
could've been you. It could've been —
any of you. But I chose her. She was
baptised in blood and is mine.

GIRL
What can we do to find her? You're
the one with all the power.

The Man slaps her hard across the face. His handprint is
. burned into her cheek. It practically boils.

MAN .
Not ALL the power. Not yet.

The Man strokes her other cheek. She flinches.
19.

GIRL _,

(frightened)
How... How will we know her?

MAN
ZI will know her. Your eyes and the
eyes of ali who serve me are mine. I
need but one of you to glance at her
and she will be revealed.

He pulls her into a kiss.

MAN (cont'd)
I'm here. Spread the word.

EXT. LOBBY - DAY

Jericho crosses to a series of elevators, still looking at
the tears in his suit jacket, when Chicago exits the elevator.

JERICHO
Look at this. You ever seen anything
like this?

CHICAGO
* Yeah, but she moved to Europe. C'mon. aa

JERICHO
Where are we going?

CHICAGO
Cops found something juicy.

EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

The Man emerges from the Plaza Hotel onto the sidewalk in
front of Central Park as a horse drawn carriage trots by. The
Horse's eyes lock on the Man. The horse rears back.

The COACHMAN pulls back on the reigns, trying to regain
control, but the horse takes off in a lather. It leaps the
retaining wall of the park and plummets. The carriage smashes
against the wall and the horse flails in mid-air above the

A smug smile breaks across the Man's face as he walks out
into the city.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

A Nurse checks the pulse of the unconscious Shooter. Her EYES —s
GLOW RED. She closes her eyes. : }
20.

2xT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY

The Man stops, closes his eyes, then opens them. He's "seen"
the Shooter. He changes direction. He passes by a group of
fifteen year-old Catholic School Girls in their skirts and
uniforms. He turns to watch them walk away. He sees a
BUSINESS MAN admiring the jailbait and smiles.

MAN
What is it about Catholic school
girls?

The Business Man looks shocked at the Man's words.

BUSINESS MAN
That's disgusting.

The Man leans in and whispers.

MAN
Go on. Who's gonna know?

The Business Man's head turns and he watches the girls sashay
down the sidewalk. He thinks a beat, glances at the Man then
back at the girls. He trots after them and follows them
around the corner. The Man grins and walks away.

EXT. RUN DOWN APARTMENT BUILDING ~ DAY

Jericho and Chicago flash their IDs to the COP standing on
the stoop.

JERICHO
Detective Francis?

CoP
He's expecting you down below.

The Cop ateps aside as Jericho and Chicago push into the
buildiag.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

Flickering bare lightbulbs dimly light the peeling wall
paper. Jericho and Chicago find the ancient staircase, with
its loose and rotting floorboards. They descend to the...

Pipes drip water and cockroaches scurry out of the way as

. Chicago and Jericho make their way down a litter strewn

Yeah. Studied in Rome. One of their

The Priest up there said he had a
vision. Then he just vanished.

Jericho furrows his brow, disturbed.

A vision? What kind of vision?

DTC. FRANCIS
End of the world stuff.

Chicago notices a thick RED pentagram drawn on the floor. He
stoops to examine its lines.

I don't think this is paint.

DTC. FRANCIS

Get a sample.

Jericho turns his attention to the wall. It's covered with
drawings. Religous icons and symbols. Pictures of Angels and
Demons struggling over the broken bones of men. On another
wall is a meticulous colored chalk illustration of a city in
flanes, the sky red, the street running with blood, held in
the palms of two giant talons coming off of scaled arms that
Gescend down the wall to the concrete floor.

They're right in front of her. She quietly lifts the baseball
bat as they open the door...

from her while the other two wrestle her to the ground. They

back in the hallway, pivoting back in every moment or so to
return fire. The Commandos race across Christine's apartment
and dive out the window bearing the fire escape, leaving
Christine bound on the floor. Jericho rushes to Christine's
aid as Chicago and Detective Francis pursue the Commandos.

Jericho pulls the sack from Christine's head and removes tho
blindfold. She begins to scream again.

INT. CHRISTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jericho turns a few more pages, then stops. He's found what
he's looking for. The Herald. A black background with a white
sword, the image of the snake wrapped around it.

CHRISTINE
That's it!

Bis finger runs over to the text beneath it.

JERICHO
They're a sub-herald of the Templar
Fnights of St. John... Considered
themselves God's Warriors...

Jericho stops reading out loud. -
CERISTINE
What?
JERICHO

They claimed the Devil would return
to Earth and devour all men's souls,
even the righteous. See the Satanic
Prophesies, End of Days.

CHRISTINE
The people who tried to kidnap me
were Devil ppers?

JERICHO
Actually, no. They called thamselvos
the Army of Good. But it says here
they disbanded in 1375.

CHRISTINE
I don't believe this. What would they
want with me? I mean, I'm nobody
special.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The Man finishes pissing and zips up. He casually pulls out
a cigarette, sticks it in his mouth. Once again the cigarette

toward the van.

 

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Chicago crosses to the rear of the van, opens the door and...

Jericho bolts up from the Kitchen table. He rushes to the
window just in time to see the FLAMING VAN LAND ON TOP OF THE
POLICE CAR in a ball of fire.

JERICHO
Get down! Get down!

Christine drops to the ground.

The Man walks through the burning fire and to the building.
He stops briefly over Chicago's body, face down on the
cement. He stoops and touches Chicago on the neck. No
movement. He rises and heads into the building.

As they run to the front door...

Rachel grabs Christine's arm.

RACHEL
No. Wait.
CSRISTINE -
Are you insane?
RACHEL

Christine backs away, but Rachel holds onto her arn.
CHRISTINE

Rachel, let go. You're bruising me.

Rachel has grabbed Christine's other wrist. She pulls her
dato the middle of the apartment.

RACHEL
Finally, Chris. After all these
years, watching and waiting, he's
finally come.

JERICHO

Jericho grabs Rachel's arm to pull her fingers from
Christine's wrist. Christine, confused, twists away. Rachel
growls and claws at Jericho. But he frees Christine. They
rush toward the decor.

RACHEL (DEMON VOICE)

Rachel flies across the room and slams into the door baring
their way. Her eyes roll back in her head. Her voice deepens.

Jericho pulls out his sidearm. The DEMON strikes hin, sending
him flying across the room.

The Beast moves toward Christine. She backs away, cowering.
It recoils to strike at her, but as it does, Jericho fires,
SEVERAL TIMES. The beast SCREAMS the scream of a woman, then
falls.

The elevator opens and the Man walks down the corridor toward
Rachel's deor, and just as he gets there...

Rachel falls into the hallway, covered in blood.
The Man steps over her and enters the apartment.
No sign of Jericho or Christine.

The Man sniffs the air... he follows thea scent back into the

He hears sirens in the background.

A ring of cops surround Christine swinging their clubs as a
DOZEN suspects try tc break through their ranks.

Individual brawls break off the main melee as cops and
criminals square off. The Hooker and the Businessman manage
to grab Christine and pull her toward the door. The Hooker
waves a gun, fending off cops.

JERICHO
Christine!

Jericho sees her across the crowded precinct floor. He tries
to go to her, but he's attacked.

INT. POLICE STATION, RECEPTION - NIGHT

The Man pushes his way past sickos and psychos toward the

Hands cuffed together, Jericho fights off a sea of attackers
and bulls his way acrosrg the roo.

She struggles against her attackers, frees herself, only to
be tackled again.

Jericho fights like a man possessed, tossing bodies out of
the way, suffering blows from billy clubs. The Hooker spots
him and fires several times, Jericho dives behind a desk.

He grabs a desk lamp and throws it at the Hooker. As she
ducks, he leaps, slamming into her and knocking the gun from
her hand. The businessman grabs him, but Jericho smashes his
palms against the bridge of the man's nose, shattering it.

Jericho grabs a gun. But suddenly... everything becomes
quiet. Everyone stops fighting.

They all turn slowly and see the Man. Most of them eye hin
like dogs staring at their master. As the Man walks, he
touches their outstretched hands. One cops steps in front of
bin, but the Man touches him and the cop steps away.

The Man finds Christine half-hiding bebind Jericho at the
opposite end of the large room. Jericho's got the gun leveled
at Man.

aN
Hello Christine.

Christine's face flickers with a dull red light. The Man
calmly walks towards Jericho and Christine. He reaches out
his arms as if to embrace his long lost love.

MAN (cont'd)
Christine, there's nothing to fear.

Christine, entranced, moves from behind Jericho and reaches
out towards the Man. Jericho pushes down her arm and blocks
ber with his body.

JERICHO ,
Don't let him touch you.

I'm what you've been waiting for,

The man is getting closer. Jericho waves his gun at the Man.

JERICHO
Stay back.

You're wrong.

Jericho drops the gun, grabs Christine and throws his body
back...

Through the precinct window.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT . =~

Jericho shields Christine as he explodes through the glass,
falling half a story to the concrete. He's tucked so the two
of them roll when they hit the ground. He pushes Christine to
her feet. She sees he's normal again.

Christine looks around as though she's just come to. He
propels her forward, struggling up after her.

The Man nods in praise.

ExT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Running full speed. Jericho pulls Christine into Central
Park. Safely away from everybody, he grabs her and hides her
deneath an underpass. Sirens scream through the night.

CHRISTINE
It's like a nightmare.

JERICHO
Maybe when the sun comes up, we'll
find out it was.

CHRISTINE
I wanted to go to him. I had this
intense, overwhelming animal
attraction for him but at the same
time, there's a part of me that was
totally repulsed. Who is he, Jericho?

SERICHO
I don’t even want to guess. But until
we find out, we're going to keep you
as far from him as we can.

CBRISTINE
I hardly know you and my life's in
your hands.

JERICHO
I'm used to it.

CHRISTINE
I'm not used to trusting anyone. It's
nice. In the morning, if we do wake
up and none of this has happened, I'm
gonna look for you.

No time to contemplate that one. Just then a man emerges from
the darkness of the park. He raises his arm, points at
Christine and SCREAMS.

Other men and women emerge from dark alleys, lurching toward
Christine and Jericho like the walking dead. They too begin ©
to scream. Pointing at her.

Jericho grabs her arm as this circle of lost souls closes in
on them. The screaming masses rush after them as the two of
them rush into the darkness.

The Man walks along the outer edge of Central Park. He hears
a chorus of screaming in the distance. He closes his eyes and
listens. Then turns into the park.

Jericho and Christine push through the underbrush. Feet
scurry about. People running all around thea.

Jericho and Christine emerge in a small clearing. Blank faces
walk toward them, pointing and screaming.

CHRISTINE
What are they?

JERICHO
Z don't know.

Jericho and Christine duck back into the brush and run. Tree
branches seem to reach cut, grabbing at them.

ANOTHER CLEARING - they emerge... but the dammed faces are
still there. Bodies shuffling toward then.

They duck back into a wooded pathway and run. They push
through more bushes and emerge onto the Park Drive.

Caught in headlights. Tires screech.

A POLICE CAR alides to a halt, broadsiding Jericho and
Christine. Enough force to knock them on their ass, but not
enough to do serious damage. They're hit by a spotlight. -_
TWO COPS emarge, immediately drawing guns.

COP

Jericho and Christine shade their eyes and raise they're
hands. Jericho's still wearing the cuffs from the Station.

The Howlers keep coming. The cop fires a warning shot in the
air. The Howlers keep coming. Christine and Jericho tense.

Jericho tilts his head slightly motioning toward the police
car. Christine nods.

The Cop, nervous, fires a second warning shot. And still they
keep coming.

Tires squeal.

The cops whip around and see their police cruiser hauling ass
away, Christine in the drivers’ seat. When they turn back
around,

, they come face to face with the Man, who touches them
both.

The Howlers disperse as the sky cracks with lightnizg.

They're joined by FATHER PETERS, a priest in his mid-thirties.

FATHER PETERS

Not a cancer... It's a spider web

stronger he gets.

shifting eyes. :

Entering bars, drifting into subways, getting into fights,
shooting heroin, fucking in the dark shadows of the streets.

Father Murphy lays a leather bound manuscript down on a
worktable.

FATHER MURPEY
The Satanic Prophecies. The original
scrolls were written over seven
thousand years ago, and discovered by
Joseph of Arimathea, when he was
guardian of the Holy Grail.

Yather Murphy opens up the five hundred year old book. The
one from the opening Vatican scene.

FATHER PETERS
As you can see, they chronicle the
End of Days. The coming of the age of
darkness.

The age of darkness. You mean
Judgement Day.
FATHER PETERS -—
No. Something far worse. .

PATHER MURPHY
On Judgement Day, the righteous are
saved. They ascend to heaven. But at
the End of Days there is no
galvation, only a new hell brought to
Earth by the Devil himself.

JERICHO
I‘ve never heard of it.

FATHER MURPHY
fhe church isn't anxious for people
to know that in some scriptures, even
the righteous can be damned.

INT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

A crazed prophet waves the Bible around talking to anybody
who might listen.

PROPHET

A couple of red-eyed FRAT BOYS sidle up to either side of
him. The Prophet backs away. The Frat Boys pounce and begin
beating on the Prophet. A few pedestrians try to break up the
fight. Suddenly more people become involved.

Bricks sail... thrown into glass storefronts. People begin
looting. It’s an out and out riot.

In a matter of seconds, Times Square is rioting.

INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - NIGHT

Father Murphy turns the pages of the antique manuscript...
illuminated with different hand-painted illustrations of men,
through the ages, battling a GREAT BEAST with a GLOWING SWORD.

YATHER MURPEY
According to the prophecy, Satan
can't be imprisoned forever. Once a

FATHER MURPHY
God does not say he will save us,

He gave us free will. Evil is not his

JERICHO
We've been around for thousands of
years. We've yet to see Heil on Earth.

FATHER MURPHY

always come forth, a righteous
warrior, to keep the girl from harm.

Jericho looks at the illustrations in the book.

JERICHO
And how do they defeat the Devil...
with a sword?

PATHER PETERS
ie is not just a sword, it's a
metaphor for faith.

CHRISTINE
And who is the protector?

YATHER MURPHY
God only knows.

CHRISTINE

Maybe it's you.

Father Peters shakes his head.

FATHER PETERS
The Protector is a man of great faith
ana virtue. No offense, but I don’t
think he's a candidate.

Jericho, as sure as God is in heaven,
the Devil is real. And if Thomas
found this woman, she might very well
be the one he's coming for.

JERICHO
He had pictures of me tco.

FATHER MURPHY

The Vatican sent Thomas because he
was sensitive to certain spiritual
matters. He could see things others
couldn't. I don’t know what role you
play, if any, but my guess is -
you've already played it by bringing
her here. We'll protect her now.

JERICHO
Do you have weapons?

FATHER MURPHY
Of course not. This is a church.

Sericho looks at Christine.

JERICHO
Wait here for me.

He heads out the decor.

Father Murphy reaches under his collar and pulls out a
necklace chain with a cross on it.

FATHER MURPHY
I've had this since my confirmation.
It's always kept me safe.

He offers it to her.

CHRISTI
Think it'll help?

FATHER MURPHY

As it nears her, the metal begins to glow bright red. rather
Murphy pulls it away. The metal calms. Brings it in close to

Pops open. He pulls a bag out of his closet. He unzips it.

Clips and dumps them into the bag. He feels around on the
shelf above him and pulls down a small biack bag.

Where did you take the girl?

Jericho whips around, gun in his hand.

JERICHO
Stay where you are.

Jericho holds his gun level at the Man. The Man sniffs.

MAN
I can smell her on you. Where is she?

JERICHO
Somewhere safe. Somewhere where she

The Man strolls to the bureau and picks up the ola photograph

Emily... David...

Memory bit - BAN! A bullet hits Emily in the chest.

EMILY
Oh God. Jericho!

A mich younger Jericho dives for her. BAM! David falls,
covered in blood. David looks up at Jeriche...

Jericho opens his eyes. His apartment is back to the way it
was.

MAN

Very well. I°11 ask you once more,
and then I'll get violent. Where's

JERICHO
Go to hell.
MAN
Sometimes hell comes to you.

The Man moves swiftly, grabbing Jericho by the throat and
lifting him off the ground. This guy is unbelievably strong.

 
67.

MAN (cont'd) ”
She's mine. She's always been mine.

Jeriche dangles a foot off the ground. The Man slans Jericho
against the glass, presses his face up against it.

MAN (cont'd)
Leok down. See them. See the little
ants. Look at them. That's all you
are to me. Now tell me, where's the

girl?

The MAN smashes him against the glass. It cracks. He SLAMS
him again, and a webwork of cracks spread.

Exterior shot -
Jericho bounces off the window. Shards of glass buckle out
and rain down on the street, far, far, far below. We see that
we're a hundred stories up.

' Interior -

The glass begins to give in shards as the MAN slams Jericho
against it.

Jericho has no choice but to OPEN FIRE at the Man with his aa
GLOCK 17. The bullets explode into the MAN. Huge exit holes
rip through his flesh spewing not blood, BUT MOLTEN FIRE.

C The Man reels back, wounded, and then regains his balance and
knocks the gun from Jericho.
MAN (cont'd)
Do you know who I am? Do you know my
power?

Z'm not afraid of you. -_

You should be.
With a final burst of power, the Man smashes Jericho against
the window, shattering it completely. He lets go of Jericho
, and Jericho FALLS...

The EDGE OF THE WINDOW FRAME with his hand. He clings to the
frame, the GLASS SHARDS CUTTING into his hands.

JERICHO LOOKS DOWN. A 100 story plummet. Hanging by a thread.

So

Jericho tries pulling himself up, but a BOOT descends on his
blecdied hand. The MAN looks down on him, speaks in a caln
measured tone.

MAN (cont'd)
It's a long way down.

The Man takes a piece of glass and presses it into Jericho's
hand, drawing blood. :

Jericho's blood slicked hand slips even further. He's at a
dizzying height. Jericho's muscles bulge as he tries to
position himself into a better grip.

MAN (cont'd)
Look down.

The Man points. Jericho looks down, all the way down. The
street seems to split open and fiery vapors swirl below.
Jericho looks up at the man.
MAN (cont'd)
Now look into your heart. You know
you cannot defeat me. Join me.
A long beat. Jericho can't hold on much longer.
MAN (cont'd)
Take my hand and I will give you
everything God took away.

Jericho looks down. Thinks. Then slowly reaches his hand up
for help.

JERICHO,
Here.

The Man extends his hand to Jericho. Jericho has trouble
swinging his free hand up.

The Man reaches out for it, but Jericho can't quite bridge
the gap. The Man reaches further cut to him when...

Jericho pulls himself up with just the one hand
GRABS THE MAN BY THE FREE ARM and...
Pulls him out the window

The Man tumbles from the window and PLUMMETS TOWARD EARTH.
FASTER and FASTER.

The MAN roars a supernatural roar and SLAMS into the concrete
at TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR.
69.

The ASPHALT SHATTERS. The GROUND RUMBLES WITH INTENSITY OF AN
EARTHQUAKE. All the nearby windows EXPLODE from the force of
the impact.

Jericho, hands slicked with blood, uses all his strength to
pull himself up and through the window.

He falls back into the room and looks out tha window.
There's a crater in the middle of the street. As if a METZOR
had struck. Nothing could survive the fall.

INT. JERICHO'S PENTHOUSE - DAY

Jericho staggers to the kitchen, dripping blood from his
hands. He washes them under the faucet.

Jericho staggers to the kitchen and washes his hands in the
sink. Then wraps rags around then.

BOOM BOOM BOOM. He hears a pounding at the door.

Jericho recovers his GLOCK and checks the peephole. He's
shocked by what he sees.

He pulls open the door, partway, revealing... aa,

CHICAGO... bruised and battered and looking like he's
sporting a monster hang-over. Chicago tries to push his way
in, but the chain is on.

CHICAGO
Open the door, man. I need some help.

JERICHO
You're dead.

CHICAGO
Bo, but I'm gonna be if you don't
open thse door.

Jericho raises his gun.

JERICHO

Jericho keeps his gun pointed at Chicago.

Jericho closes the door. Mouths "shit" to himself, then
undoes the chain and opens the door again. He pulls Chicago
inside, keeping the gun to his head.

SERICHO
I can‘t trust you.

CHICAGO
Don't kill me, man. I'll go. I'll
leave.
Jericho shoves Chicago back and raises the gun.

JERICHO
I just need to know.

CHICAGO
You're whacked, man.

Jericho fires. The bullet skims the surface of Chicago's arn.
Blood spurts out.

JERICHO -
Ob Jesus, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I

Chicago winces in pain.
CHICAGO

He locks all the way up at the dizzying distance he fell. He
climbs up out of the pit. A TOURIST takes pictures with his
camera.

TOURIST
Hell of a fall there, Mister.

MAN
I've had worse.

INT. JERICHO'S PENTHOUSE ~ DAY

Jericho sees the crowd part for the Man. He backs away from
the window.

JERICHO
Come on. We can't stay here.

Jericho gathers up his guns.

Jericho and Chicago head down the stairwell.

CHICAGO

JERICHO

CHICAGO
Like hell you can't. Who's this girl

JERICHO
Z can't explain it.

CHICAGO
Okay, listen, we leave town together.

Looks into his clear oyes.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Dozens more people have entered the Church, and are praying.
Several Priesta stand vigilant watch around Christine.

CHRISTINE
What's taking him so long?

PATHER MURPHY
This is a House of God. We're safe
here. :

Shadows suddenly move all around them as dark figures drop
from the rafters of the roof, accelerating down ropes toward
the ground. HALF DOZEN of them, fleeting shadows.

PEOPLE SCREAM, panicked.

Moving quickly, the shadows pounce on Father Murphy and

Christine. Piano wire goes around Murphy's neck, another

around Christine's. She tries to scream, but her cries are

muffied. Black gloves, stitched with the cross. Modern day
ghts.

Sub-machine guns burst forth, covering the assembled prayers.
DARK FIGURE
You can't protect her, Father. She's
already lost.

The OLD CARDINAL, from the earlier Vatican scens, and the
leader of this small band of commandos, pushes back hia hood.

FATHER MURPEY
Who are you? What do you want?

The Old Cardinal withdraws a silver dagger, shaped very much
like the cross.

OLD CARDINAL
(to Christine)
Prepare yourself.

Christine fights her bonds.

FATHER MURPHY
Yor what? Prepare herself for what?
73.

OLD CARDINAL -_
If mankind is to be saved, we must ,
prevent the union from taking place.
She must be sacrificed before the
altar of our Lord.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

Jericho hands Chicago his gun.

JERICHO
Be careful.

Jericho heads down the alley. Chicago looks at the gun, looks
at Jericho and then slides the piece into his waistband.

CHICAGO
You too.

Chicago trots down the alley. Filled with urgency.

Chicago presses through a throng of pecple up to the Man. om

CHICAGO
He's holding her in a church. st.

INT. CHURCH OF SAINT JOHN THE DIVINE - DAY

Pour Knights each hold down one of Christine's limbs. One
knight restrains Father Murphy, while the Cardinal dips the
Gagger in the holy water. He holds the dagger over
Christine's breast. She struggles, tossing and turning
against her captors.

The gathered refugees in the church cower away.

On the DAIS - We see the manuscript from the opening scene.
The Cardinal reads from the Latin text.

OLD CARDINAL
In taking life, we restore life, in
sacrificing cur souls we save souls.
Fallen Angel, Lord of Darkness. Get
thee behind me: for it is written,
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
and him only shall thouv serve. . =

He raises the dagger.
.

74.

OLD CARDINAL (cont'd)
May God forgive us.

ALL OTHERS
amen.

The Old Cardinal swings the dagger down.

JERICHO
God may forgive you, but I won't.

The Old Cardinal hesitates just a moment.
BAM.

The dagger blade shatters from the force of a bullet round
from Jericho's gun.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Get away from her.

The Cardinal tries to stab Christine with the broken blade.
Jericho fires again. This time, he shoots A HOLE in the Old
Cardinal's hand.

Jericho, holding a gun in either hand, walks down the length
of the church. The Old Cardinal does not move. Blood drips
off his fingers

OLD CARDINAL
Are you her protector?

JERICHO
Step aside.

OLD CARDINAL
You have already failed.

From beneath their cloaks, the Knights level their automatic
weapons at Jericho. Jericho dives for cover as the Knights
open fire. Bullets chew up the wooden pews.

FATHER MURPHY
Yor Godsake. This is a church. You're
desecrating it!

Two of the Knights trot down the aisle, guns leveled. They
halt by the pew Jericho dove behind.

KNIGHT #1
He's gone.

CRACK. Behind the old Cardinal, two of his comrades fall
quickly as Jericho moves with lightning blows to their heads.
By the time the Old Cardinal reacts, there is a gun pointed
right at his temple.
The Knight holding Father Murphy realizes there is a gun to
bis head, also. Both of them are held by Jericho.

The unarmed Cardinal glances at the gun barrel against his

head.

JERICHO
What do you want with the girl?

OLD CARDINAL
If she is slain, his hope of creating
a kingdom of hell on earth will die
with her. .

JERICHO
You would sacrifice the lamb to
defeat the lion?

OLD CARDINAL
It is God's will.

FATHER NURPHY
No. It is your will. This can only
lead to our destruction.

OLD CARDINAL
He cannot be defeated. It's the only
way to win.

OLD CARDINAL (cont'd)
Yor a thousand years we have sworn
ourselves to this. We aren't afraid

JERICHO
And I'm not afraid to kill you.

Murphy shudders.

Something just went through me. Icy,

Father Murphy holds forth his crucifix in defense.

MAN (cont'd)
Save that for your exorciams, Father,
You can not drive me out of myself.

The crucifix bursts into flames.

FATHER MURPHY
This is the house of the Lord our
God. You are not welcome here.

The Man looks around with disdain, then...
The STAINED GLASS WINDOWS BLOW OUT in a rain of glass.

All the candles flair, burning intensely. The buttresses
shake and start to crumble. CHUNKS of GRANITE collapse from
the arches and a WALL OF FIRE rises behind hin.

The gathered faithful look on in terror. They rush out the
church doors trying to get to safety.

MAN
Christine...

He holds his hands out for her. Christine rises. Sho seems
almost in a trance. Turns toward him.

JERICHO
Christine... NO!

CHRISTINE
You don't understand. I feel him
daside me. I need hin.

OLD CARDINAL
Protect the girl!

The CHURCH shakes violently, collapsing. Jericho grabs
Christine and pulls her toward the back door. The Commandos
turn their weapons on the Man.

KNIGHT #1
Por The Glory Of God!

They cpen fire with automatic bursts, Bullet holes burst
through the Man, pushing him back like the driving rain.

He stops and stands perfectly still. Then TONGUES OF FLAME
sHOOT OUT from him, disemboweling the commandos.
77.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY ~)

But you wouldn't know it was day. Dark clouds have gathered,
tinged with red, blotting out the sun. More lightning flashes.

Jericho and Father Murphy pull Christine into the alley as
large chunks of stained glass rain down on the two of then.

FATHER MURPHY
God help us. It's his army.

But there are hundreds of people gathered in the darkness.
Hands reaching for them. Closing in on both sides of the
alley.

Jericho pulls Christine back, but they grab Murphy. He's
swallowed by the sea of people.

FPATHER MURPHY (cont'd)
Help me. Dear God, help me.

Jericho pulls Christine into the Church, all the time hearing
the sounds of Murpby scream as his limbs are ripped asunder.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Gothic. stones bleed, pews burn. Jericho pulls Christine =
through the church. They see the Man hovering over the ,
cowering Cardinal.

MAN
A thousand years you've waited for
this moment. And you have failed. She
will be mine after all.

The Man bas recovered the broken silver dagger, imbeds the
blade into the chest of the Cardinal. He cuts out the Old
Cardinal's heart and holds it, still beating, in his hand.
The Man bites into the still beating heart. The Old Cardinal
screams in pain and bursts into flame.

The Church begins to collapse all around them. Jericho pulls
Christine through a door by the rear of the church and into
a stairwell.

INT. STAIRWELL ~ DAY

Everything rumbles. It's like trying to run down the stairs
in an Earthquake. Jericho pushes through another set of doors
revealing the underground chamber. The stairwell collapses
_behind then.

Run!
C)

78.

They rush across the chamber as pieces of rock and plaster ,
tumble from the ceiling. They reach a set of doors on the far
side.

Jericho tries them. Locked.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET

The Cathedral COLLAPSES into a heap and is SWALLOWED INTO A
PIT OF FIRE. A crowd gathers staring into the pit.

INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - DAY

The ground shakes and rumbles. From the stairwell a tongue of
fire shoots out at them.

A wall of fire rolls toward them. They're trapped at the end
of the chamber. With all his might Jericho slams against the
door. It gives. They tumble through it, just as the tongue of
flame reaches then.

INT. SEWER - DAY

The fire bursts through the doorway, but Jericho and
Christine are out of its path. They hear the mighty structure
cave in bebind then.

Then all is quite. Jericho takes Christine by the hand as
they struggle through the muck.

CHRISTINE
I didn't think he could do that to a
church.

JERICHO
He did.

CHRISTINE
You mean you believe?

JERICHO
.He doesn't give me mich choice.

CHRISTINE
Uhg that smell. I think I'm going to
be sick.

JERICHO
You'll get used to it.

CHRISTINE
For how long?
79.

JERICHO =
As long as we can stay out of sight.
If what they said is true, we only
have to avoid him until midnight, the
New Year.
CHRISTINE
New Years Eve in the sewer system?
Well, anything's better than Times
Square. :

The two of them disappear into the sewers.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Prom the rubble of the church, the Man emerges and heads
toward his followers.

MAN
Find her.

INT. SEWER - DAY

Followers drop down from man holes and fan out in the sewer
system, carrying flashlights, ‘torches... anything they can —
muster. y

INT. ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY

Jericho hoists Christine up into a maintenance room off the
main sewer, and then pulls himself up. Christine leans
against Jericho, exhausted. They're both sweating buckets.

CHRISTINE
It's so hot. Must be over a hundred
Gegrees. a

JERICHO
We'll dehydrate if we stay down here
too long.

Jericho checks his guns. *

CHRISTINE
Y'know, I've always felt like there
was some kinda curse on me. Don't get
too fond of ms, Jericho. People I get
involved with tend to die.

JERICHO
I used to feel that way. . aan
80.

CHRISTINE
Did you lose someone close? *

4A long beat.

JERICHO
My wife and son.

CHRISTINE
I'm sorry.

JERICHO
It was a robbery. I couldn't protect
them. All I could do was watch.

CHRISTINE
Ah, so you do what you do out of
guilt. You'd make a good Catholic.

JERICHO
Any faith I had, I lost after my
family died. What kind of God allows
children to be murdered?

CHRISTINE
In my better moments I believe
there's a purpose. Still, sometimes
I can't help thinking "Why me?" What
did I do to deserve this? One point
five billion women on the planet and
this guy wants me.

JERICHO
Did it ever occur to you, you might
be special? =-

CHRISTINE
You spend your life trying to
convince yourself that you're
something special just to make it

Jericho puts an arm around her to comfort her. she rests her
head on his chest. Christine sighs.

CHRISTINE (cont'd)
I wish I could get him out of my
mind, leering at me. Wanting me.

JERICHO
Try not to think about it. *

Jericho slaps a new clip inte his backup Glock.
81.

CERISTINE
Maybe you could show me how to use
one of those things.

INT. SEWER - DAY

Groups of Followers make their way down the dark, dank
tunnels. Their glowing red eyes peer from their seemingly
lifeless faces.

INT. SEWER - DAY

Christine stares down the barrel of the Glock. Jericho's arm
reaches around her, his hand surrounding hers on the grip.

JERICHO
You just line them up in the
crosshairs and squeeze. But be ready
for the recoil. First time's always
a little painful until you find the
z

She squeezes. Click. Click. Click. Click.

JERICHO (cont'd)

Be hands her a clip and demonstrates how to slide it in.
SERICHO (cont'd)
And always remember to count your
rounds. You have ten left. Here's the
safety. Leave it on til you...
BAM! Jericho dives out of the way.

SERICHO (cont'd)
What are you doing?

One of the Followers falls out of the darkness at Jericho's
feet.

CHRISTINE
Nine left.

Jericho looks at the hole in the Follower's forehead.

JERICHO
Nice shot.

_ Jericho pulls cut his gun, checks the tunnel.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Come on. There'll be more coming.
82.

INT. SEWER - DAY

Jericho and Christine splash through the shallow water. They
hear echoes and shouts, seemingly surrounding them. The
hounds after the foxes. Up ahead the sewer splits at a
juncture.

JERICHO
Wait a minute.

Jericho studies the two paths. Christine hears the voices and
looks around. She takes aim at the darkness with her gun.

CHRISTINE
Does it matter?

JERICHO
If we can make it to the Westside, we
might have a chance of getting out of
the city.

He picks...

JERICHO (cont'd)
This way.

«+. and away they go. BAM! BAM! We see gun-barrel flashes in
the darkness of the tunnel. Jericho and Christine emerge a
beat later.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Wrong way.

They head down the other tunnel, the soulless creatures
behind then.

Dizzying shots as Jericho and Christine flee down sewage
tunnel, turning left and right... down narrow passage ways.

They hear the shouts behind them, see the dull glow of
torches and flashlights chasing then.

Christine tumbles. Jericho runs to her side. She's breathing
hard and gripping her side.

CHRISTINE
I can't keep running.

JERICHO
You have to.

CERISTINE
Z can't breathe. No air.

Jericho lifts her to her feet.
83.

JERICHO
I know it hurts. But you have to keep
moving.

The sounds are all around them now. The dull glowing lights
sear. A second set of lights appears further up the tunnel.
They're cut off.

CHRISTINE
You're lucky. They catch you, they'll
just kill you.

Jericho looks around for options. He sees a shaft of light
ahead. Problem is, the mob is closer to it than they are.

JERICHO
Manhole cover. We can make it to the
street.

CERISTINE
But...

JERICHO
Come ont

Jericho grabs her and pulls her along the sewer toward the
shaft of light and toward the approaching mob. Somewhere ~
Christine finds the strength to keep up. !

CHRISTINE
I... don't... think... we're...
gonna... make... it.

JERICHO
Come on... faster! Faster!

Another fifteen yards to the shaft, but the mob is almost
beneath it.

Jericho breaks out in front of Christine. He pulls bis gun
from its holster.

Almost there. Angry red eyes. BAM! BAM! Jericho fires a few
warning rounds, driving the mob momentarily back.

Jericho reaches the shaft of light and positions himself by
A WROUGHT IRON LADDER running up the side of the sewer.
_ Christine reaches him and he pushes her up the ladder.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Climb!

Exhausted, she pulls herself up... hand over hand. Jericho
scrambles up after her. But the mob is right on them. They =
jump, grabbing onto Jericho's leg. He's pyutied back down, but ‘
continues climbing. People hang off of hin.
84.

They bite into his flesh like rabid dogs and tear at him. Re
kicks and hits at then.

Christine reaches the top of the ladder. One hand clutches :
the ladder as the other pushes up on the manhole.

CHRISTINE
It's too heavy.

With a sharp elbow, Jericho knocks the last of the followers
off, but more are coming. Jericho climbs up over Christine,
presing against her.

The two of them together push aside the manhole cover.
Christine wriggles up the ladder and out onto...

EXT. STREET - DAY

Overhead the SKIES glow RED with fire. The crimson clouds
march against the sun, choking off the light.

As Jericho and Christine emerge from below, they see another
piece of hell. Ahead, a handful of men wearing business suits
drag a Buddhist Monk into the street and dump gasoline on hin.

The leader pulls out a match, ‘laughing. Lights it.

‘BAM! Blood erupts on the Leaders hand. Jericho re-ains his
gun at the leaders head.

JERICHO
(to the Monk)
Run!

The Monk scrambles to his feet and takes off.

CHRISTINE
Jericho!

Jericho turns they're coming out of the ground now. Christine
keeps her gun aimed on the hole, while Jericho covers the
approaching businessmen.

CHRISTINE (cont'd)
(muttering)
Goddamn hostile takeover.

JERICHO
Come on.

They back away. Many of the followers point and scream.
Jericho and Christine break into a run. They pursue.

Another wall of RED EYES approach from another direction
cutting them off. Jericho fingers his gun. They're surrounded.
85.

JERICHO (cont'd)
How many rounds?

CHRISTINE
Not enough.

Jericho smashes the window of a Buick, parked curbside.

JERICHO
Get in!

He unlocks the door. Christine jumps in and slams the door
shut, locking it. A moment later the followers are at her
window.

Jericho rips the cowling off the steering wheel. As he
attempts to jump the car, hands reach in through the smashed
window. Jericho fends them off but they get a grip on him and
try to pull him from the car.

SMASH! Christine turns. A guy is smashing a brick against her
window. SMASH! The saftey glass pebbles but does not give.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Christine... the ignition... the red
- and green wires.

Christine leans over to the ignition. Frantic, and not sure
what to do, she pulls wires and tries to connect then.

Bodies choke off all light as the followers crawl all over
the vehicle like a swarm of ants.

Jericho has been pulled halfway out of the window now.
Pighting... struggling to get back inside.

SMASH! The passenger window shatters and gives. Tiny shards
or. safety glass rain all over Christine. Hands reach in for

VROOOM! - The engine roars to life. Christine's wired it!
The minions unlock the passenger door.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Get us cut of here!

Christine pulls the car into gear and it starts to slowly
roll.

But the Minions pull the door open and dive into the car...

_ Christine lunges beneath the dash and slams her hand on the
accelerator.

—
+,

86.

SWARMED BY MINIONS, the vehicle springs to life. Tires spin
before finding their purchase. Then the vehicle lurches
forward, the followers tossed from it as it goes.

INSIDE THE CAR - Christine keeps one hand on the gas and one
band on Jericho's belt, trying to keep him in the car. She's
kicking at the other man hanging on by the passenger door.

OUTSIDE THE CAR - Jericho uses the momentum to wrestle the
swarm off him. He manages to toss the last person from him.
He looks up to see...

The car careening toward the edge of a building. Hanging
halfway out the car, Jericho's about to have his upper body
ripped off.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Christine!

Inside the car, one of the followers leaps from the doorway
at Christine. He lands near her and pulls himself to her by
tugging on the steering wheel.

OUTSIDE THE CAR - A split second before Jericho's upper body
slams into a building's edge, the car veers away. Jericho
clears the building corner by inches. He manages to push
himself back inside. -

INSIDE THE CAR - Jericho slips into the driver's seat and
with one swift punch, he sends Christine's attacker flying
out of the car.

Jericho floors it and heads the car west, toward the Westside
Highway, passing riotous carnage around him.

CHRISTINE
How could everything fall apart so
quickly?

JERICHO
It's New York.

Lightning explodes across the sky.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

Bonfires everywhere. Gangs attecking pedestrians, people
being beaten, a toppled bus on f.

A group of Cops are shooting at a frightened woman. Everytine
she tries to run, they open fire... pinning her down. she
mutters prayers under her breath.

Im the middle is... Detective Francis. Francis sees the Buick
drive by. He IDs Jericho and the Christine.
87.
Dore. FRANCIS
Son-of-a-bitch.
He waves to the other police officers. They huddle around
him. The woman uses that moment to make her escape down the
alley. None of the cops notice.
INT. BUICK - DAY

Jericho drives through the obstacle course of bodies, burned
out cars, and trash.

SMASH! They're jarred as they're hit from behind by...
A POLICE CRUISER.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Three POLICE CARS pull behind the Buick. One of them hangs on
its tail and the other two pull up around then.

Jericho swings the car back and forth, trying to slam the
cars out of the way. But they squeeze hin.

JERICHO
Get down!

Christine ducks.
The rear window explodes from a shotgun shell.

BAM. BAM. They're slammed around again. Jericho spots a lamp
post up ahead. He jockeys ahead of one of the police cars and
swings his wheel around hard. Metal grinds. The cruiser
swings over and...

SLAMS into the LAMP POST. _

The Buick bounces off the cruiser and Jericho steers it up
ento the sidewalk. The cops give chase. The police cruisers
shatter pnrming meter after parking meter as they xace after
the °

Jericho spins back onto the street at the next corner. One of
the police cars can't keep up. It takes the turn too wide and
smashes into a FLAMING CAR and explodes.

The last police car pulls side-by-side with Jericho.

Jericho glances over to see Francis at the wheel. Jericho
Jockeys with him. Francis swings his wheel, smashing into the
Buick. The Buick spins out, bounces off the curb and comes to
a halt in the middle of the street. Its engine dies.

J
()

Jericho tries to re-jump the car, crossing the ignition wires.

Meanwhile, Francis doubles back in his cruiser, eyeing the
Buick which sits dead in the road like a lame duck. .

Francis floors it. He going to ram the Buick. Christine sees
him coming.

CHRISTINE
Jericho!

Jericho leoks up and sees the police car bearing down on
them. He returns to the wires.

Just as the cop car is about to hit then...

The Buick's engine spring to life. Jericho slams on the gas.
The Buick lurches forward. The Police cruiser hits the curb,
and bounces onto the sidewalk.

Francis spins the wheel. The cop car skids, hits the side of
a building and accelerates after the Buick.

The Buick races down the dark streets, with the police
cruiser following.

EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - DAY

Jericho steers the car up the onramp. He has to slam on his
breaks to avoid hitting a mass of New Yorkers racing down the
parkway, carrying their children and clutching their meager
belongings. A stream of cars sits silently, abandoned hours
ago in a massive traffic jam.

CHRISTINE
The city... everybody's leaving.

JERICHO
Get out of the car.

Christine and Jericho bail. A moment later, Francis comes
barreling up the onramp and slams into the empty Buick.

Francis pulls himself from his deployed airbag and steps out
of the wrecked police cruiser. He holds a 12 gauge shotgun
and scouts for Christine and Jericho. Christine steps out
from behind the car.

CHRISTINE
Looking for me?

As Francis turns around Jericho pops up behind him and fires
several rounds. Francis goes down.
89.
Jericho picks up the 12 Gauge. Looking back at the skyline of
the city, they see New York is awasb in blood and flames.

JERICHO
Keep going...

Jericho looks north to the George Washington Bridge...

JERICHO (cont'd)
- It's another mile to the bridge.

CHRISTINE
We can make it.

A father and son run by them. The six year-old boy stumbles

and is almost trampled by the crowds. Jericho stoops to pick
him up, but the father snatches the boy away.

5ON .
(through tears)
Daddy... Why are we running?
DAD
God has abandoned us.
The two push on. Dozens of others race by.

JERICHO
Come onl

Christine and Jericho join the trail of refugees. But the
earth begins to rumble.

CHRISTINE
Look... there...

In the distance the George Washington bridge sways and
buckles. We can see it's teening with thousands of people
fleeing the city.

The water below bubbles, boiling and roiling. Steam rises off
its surface.

The George Washington Bridge COLLAPSES... thousands of bodies
drop into the boiling water. SCREAMS. SHOUTS OF HORROR.

JERICHO
He knows we're trying to leave.

CHRISTINE
He won't let me. —

90.
JERICHO
We'll try the tunnel.
They look DOWNTOWN - The boiling water parts and...
A giant concrete shell rises -

THE LINCOLN TUNNEL, cracked right down the middle. Cars spit
forth from its end and bodies float to the surface.

CHRISTINE
I can't watch.

She buries herself in Jericho's chest. The screams of the
people carry across the water.

CHRISTINE (cont'd)
Make it stop. Make it stop.

JERICHO
I can't.

CHRISTINE
There's no place safe, is there?

. JERICHO
We're gonna make it; Together.

CBRISTINE
We can't. They're everywhere. They're
everywhere.

Jericho leads Christine back to the Buick but his Followers
are already there. Dozens of them marching toward them. They
turns and run up the highway. The Followers break into a run
after then.

Jericho fires a couple of shots off as he and Christine race
Gown the highway.

Jericho veers off to the highways edge.

JERICHO
This way.
He clizmbs over the safety railing, then helps Christine. Just
as the Followers reach out to grab them, they jump falling
about twenty feet down an exbankzent.

The Followers chase them. But around the corner screams a
black Limousine, cutting off the Followers.

The rear doors fly open, and Jericho and Christine dive into
the back.

The doors close and the Limousine screeches away.
sl.

Int. LIMO - DAY
Chicago steers the limo past the mob of followers.

JERICHO
How'd you find us?

CHICAGO
ZI Gidn't. When I got to the Church it
was gone. I've been trying to get out
of town. But we're fucking trapped.
These crazies are everywhere. Jer,
this is something right out of the
bible, man. It's... it's like God's
wrath. Like Sodem and Gomorah.

JERICHO
God isn't doing this.
(beat)
Take us to the vault.

C8ICAGO
The vault? Are you kidding? We've got
to get out of town.
: OERICHO
There's no way off this island.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

A dark series of clouds march against Central Park. They
swirl overhead, casting lightning down.

Inside the Park, a giant structure begins to take shape.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

The three of them dash from the Limousine into a tunnel
corridor.

JERICHO
We should be safe here as leng as we
weren't seen.

INT. TUNNEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The three of them rush to the end of a metal and concrete
corridor. When they hit the wall, Chicago taps a code into
the keyboard. A panel slides open revealing another set of
elevator doors.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Please place your hand on the scanner.
92.

Chicago raises his hand to the scanner but hesitates.

JERICHO
What's wrong?

CHICAGO
Nothing. It's just... I don't think
I updated my clearance.

Jericho eyes Chicago suspiciously.

JERICHO
Put your hand on the scanner.

CHICAGO
Come on, man. We don't have time to
argue. Just do it.

CHRISTINE
What's going on?

° CHICAGO
Nothing. Just... Go ahead.

Jericho grabs Chicago's hand and forces it down on the
scanner.

CHICAGO (cont'd)
No. Stop. Hey, don't.

Jericho presses Chicago's hand against the scanner. Chicago
struggles, but the scanner passes over his palin.

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Subject identified. Leroy Chicago,
2223. Security alert. Subject is
deceased.

JERICHO
What do you mean, deceased?

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Subject has no pulse.

They all turn and lcok at Chicago. He smiles sheepishly.
Jericho slams Chicago against the wall. SPIKES lunge out of
Chicago's face. His skin turns brown, reptilian. His cyes
burn with fire.

CHICAGO
I didu‘t want to, Jer. Please believe
me. He made me do it.

JERICHO
IZ it is you, forgive me.

 
93.

a“

Jericho opens fire, blowing Chicago away. Every bullet blows
rotting flesh, smoke and molten lava down the corridor.

CHICAGO
He's coming, Jer. He's coming for
her. And there's nothing you can do
te stop hin.

JERICHO
- Ge to hell.

CHICAGO
Yeah, okay. Whatever you say. But he
knows where you are. They're all
ceming and there's no escape.

 

Jericho slams down on the scanner, the laser scans his hand...

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Authorization verified.

The elevator opens. He pushes Christine inside.

INT. SHELTER - DAY
The blast doors open, and the two of them enter. ~,

CHRISTINE
Where are we?

JERICHO
Hunter Security's nuclear shelter.
Four hundred feet below Manhattan.

Jericho flips on the central console.
CHRISTINE
What are you doing?
JERICHO
Seeing what's out there.

Security Video warms up showing the approach to the entrance
of the vault. He sees Followers crowding in.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Don't worry. They can't get down here.

He hits another series of switches. Snowy images of a
newscaster drift onto the main screen.

NEWSCASTER (T.V.)
eee am hundreds of thousands of
people flocked to the Hudson River
shore line to pray.
94.

Behind the Newscaster - Crowds of people watch the swirling
storms over Manhattan and the continuous thunderbolts that
rain down from above. Women count beads and men fall down on
their knees praying to heaven.

NEWSCASTER (cont'd; T.V.)
The tide of refugees which built
throughout the day ended abruptly
less than an hour ago, when all
routes in and out of the city were
severed. There has been no
communication from the island since.
With river temperatures now above
boiling, the National Guard has been
umable to send help via watercraft,
and helicopter attempts have been met
by hurricane force winds. Churches
across the nation have opened their
doors to the frightened masses
fearing the Apocalypse...

The screen goes black. Dead.

JERICHO
There's nothing to do but wait.

Jericho looks at the clock on the wall. Six hours to
midnight. Then he notices blood seeping through the back of
Christine's shirt.

JERICHO (cont'd)
You're bleading.

CBRISTINE
I got hit by some glass.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - EVENING

The Man walks down the street. Looting goes on all around
him. A group of followers walk behind him, becoming an army.

Iyr. VAULT - NIGHT

Christine leans forward with her shirt in her lap. The rear
of her back is streaked in blood. Jericho hovers over her
plucking the glass from her skin. She winces.

CHRISTINE
Why'd you stay with me, Jericho? You
@idn't have to.

JERICHO
This Protector of yours never showed
up. I couldn't leave you alone.
CHRISTINE ~
I think you're my protector.

JERICHO
You heard the Priest. It can‘t be me.

CHRISTINE
Maybe God has more faith in you than
you have in hin.

JERICHO
Hold still.

CHRISTINE
In case the world ends, I just want
you to know...

JERICHO
What?

CHRISTINE
That I wish we had more time.

He dips a wash cloth in water and swabs the wounds on her
back.

We'll talk about it over dinner
Qo tomorrow.

CHRISTINE
What if there is no tomorrow?

She stands, turns and searches his eyes for an answer. she
kisses him. He pulls away.

JERICHO
Don't.

She pushes away, then pulls her shirt back on.

CHRISTINE
I'm sorry. I shouldn't've done that.

JERICHO
Wo. Not here. Not now. We deserve
better.

CHRISTINE
Just as well. The others died
before...
(beat)
I guess ho was saving me for hin.
The glasses clatter together as a slight tremor goes through ~
( the Vault.
>

96.

They listen and hear the sound of metal bending and twisting
around then.

CERISTINE (cont'd)
Sounds like an earthquake.

Jericho heads to the security console. Checks on all the
cameras. His Followers crowd the screens. They're out there
by the hundreds.

The entire vault JOLTS as if something had slammed into it.
The two of them tumble to the floor.
CHRISTINE (cont'd)
Jericho, I can feel him.

Jericho claws his way back up to the video screens. Searching
them. And then one by one, each of the twenty video screens
goes black. They hear scratching and clawing at the metal.
Footsteps walking above them and then walking below then.

They follow the invisible creature with their eyes and ears
as the sounds scamper around the cutside of the roon.
Christine steps behind Jericho, standing close to him.
Jericho pulls out his gun.

JERICHO
We're surrounded by bedrock. Nothing
ean get to us.

The vault rocks back and forth violently. They're thrown
against the floor. Metal twists and buckles.

The lights go out. Eerie Red Emergency lighting comes on.
They wait, holding their breath.

ONE SIDE OF THE VAULT abruptly JERKS UPWARD, followed by the
other side.

It's as if...

JERICHO (cont'd)
He's pulling us to the surface!

The vault leaps and shakes. We can hear earth and stone and
metal twist and grind through the steel walls. As the floor
pulls up from under them, they slide down to what was the
side wall. Tables and chairs and video equipment tumble down
on top of them. Jericho covers Christine with his body and
takes the brunt of a heavy wooden desk and several computers.

The Vault jerks upward again, and again, accelerating in pace.
97.
JERICHO (cont'd) >
Grab hold.

Like the express elevator from hell, the earth spits up the
vault. Lights flicker, furniture tumbles, equipment shatters.

Then suddenly all is quiet.

A couple of the emergency lights are still lit. Dark and
gloomy though, as if in some crypt. Jericho has his body
wrapped around Christine.

JERICHO (cont'd)
Christine? Christine?

She blinks her eyes open. Looks up at him. Jericho has a cut
on his forehead. She touches it lightly. There's something
erotic about her touch. Jericho pulls away.

JERICHO (cont'd)
We sust be on the street.

CHRISTINE
He's out there.

JERICHO
The walls are reinforced steel. It'd —,
take a miracle to break through them. :

CHRISTINE
Remember who we're dealing with.

The VAULT rocks. In the dim red light we see an indentation
appear on the wall.

WWWHOMP I
Another bump erupts in the metal.

CSERISTINE (cont'd)
are you sure?

JERICHO
They're holding.

The SLAMMING STOPS. A few beats pass. The two of than wait.

CHRISTINE
Do you feel that?

JERICHO

What? —~

A

98.

CHRISTINE
It's getting warm in here.

JERICHO
He's melting his way through.

The wall before them begins to glow, a dull red at first, and
then a bright orange.

Jericho climbs over debris to the weapons locker, now face
down on the ground. He pulls it open. Inside are weapons.
Jericho pulls out a pump-action rifle and loads it.

CHRISTINE
What are you doing?

JERICHO
He was beaten before by other men.
Men with nothing better than a sword.
A hole appears in the steel as the liquid metal drips away.

CHRISTINE
He's coming through.

Jericho grabs and MP-5 FULL AUTO and slings it on.

JERICHO
Get behind me.

The lava hole in the metal grows. Beyond it is a dark
silhouette, his hands pressed against the metal.

CHRISTINE
Whatever happens... thanks for trying.

with a flash, the molten metal peels back, revealing the Man.
Jericho fingers the trigger on the shot gun.

A quiet moment as the two men regard each other. The Man
steps forward and...

Jericho fires.

BAM! The shell blows into the Man's chest, knocking him back,
but not down.

BAM! BAM! BAM! Jericho drives the Man back out the melted
opening and into...

EXT. STREET - EVENING

The house-sized vault rests beside a huge pit in the roadway

by the Hunter Security Building. Crashed cars are scattered
about the intersection.
99.

Hundreds of bis followers crowd the streets, like an Arny of —
the Damned.

The Man lies on the street, fallen.

The crowds look down at the fallen Man, and then at Jericho.
They cower away as Jericho swings the MP-5 around at the

But from the corner of his eyes he sees the Man rise.

Jericho turns and opens fire with the MP-5. The rounds drive
into the Man, but still he stalks toward Jericho. Jericho
backs away, keeping up the barrage of bullets, until he and
Christine are pressed with their backs against the wall.

MAN
Don't you understand. It's futile.

The Man reaches out and takes the gun from Jericho. He grips
it tight and the gunmetal melts in his hand.

Jericho throws a punch at the Man, landing firmly on his
chin. The Man glares at Jericho, insulted by the blow.

The Man grabs Jericho's fist and drives it back, slamming hin
against the wall. He smashes Jericho with his forearn.

Jericho falls to his knees. The Man looks to Christine. ™~
MAN (cont'd)
X can feel your fear. I can feel your
heart tremble. But look on me. Feel
me. I'm not here to hurt you. I'm
here to set you free... and give you
eternal life.

JERICHO
Christine! Try to resist. There's _
nothing he can give you.

Christine turns her head and backs away.

Jericho pulls himself to his feet, but he's grabbed and held
by several of the Followers. He tries to fight them off, but
with the sheer number of them it's almost impossible.

SERICHO (cont'd)
Christine, look at me.

MAN
Look at me. “
100.

o She finally does and cannot look away.

MAN (cont'd)
I know you've suffered. But was it I
who made you thus? Why did he bring
you into the world, if only to feel
sorrow.

CHRISTINE
I... I don't know.

MAN
I know your pain.

JERICHO
Leave her alone. Don't listen
Christine. Don't listen.

MAN
Everybody you loved, God took from
you. He murdered them. It was his
will.

CHRISTINE
Yos.

MAN
Why? Why did he do it? Had you
o angered him?

CHRISTINE
No.

MAN
Bad they done anything wrong?

MAN
Then why?

CHRISTINE
I don't know.

MAN
He took away your world. Help me take
away his.

He holds her with his eyes. She sways leans forward... and he
kisses her. Deep. Erotic. She kisses him back. Jericho is
defeated.
101.

MAN (cont'd)
(to Jericho)
My bloed's been in her veins for
years. You never had a chance, you
know. Neither did God. :

Jericho breaks free from the Followers and rushes the Man,
but he's tackled immediately and thrown down to the ground.

: MAN (cont'd) :
Show him the error of his ways.

They grab what they can find... Bricks, stones, lead pipes.
They beat hin.

Jericho tries to break away. He tries to run. But they swing
at him, they pelt him. He covers his head and pushes through
the crowd, but he's met by crushing blow after crushing blow.

They hound him like a pack of dogs and slowly they bring him
down, beating him senseless.

Pinally, JERICHO COLLAPSES.

MAN (cont'd)
- Enough!
The Followers slowly stay their blows. They part, pulling - ”
back in a circle, and leok down at Jericho's broken frame.

MAN (cont ‘d)
Don't let him die. If he dies, he
goes to God. But if he lives, when _
the kingdoms are joined, his soul too
shall fall, and he shall serve me...
forever.

Blood seeps from Jericho's wounds. He tries to crawl, but he
collapses.

JERICHO
Help me, please. For godsake.

MAN
Yor Godsake?

The Man looks around.
MAN (cont'd)
Where is God? Why has he abandoned
your

_We hold on Jericho. It's painful just to look at him.
102.

MAN (cont'd)
Look at you, Jericho. You're beaten.
You're forsaken. You've lost.

Jericho struggles to move. But can't.

JERICHO
You're gonna have to kill me.

MAN .
No... You will not go to heaven and
goon your soul, and every other soul,
will be mine... mine because you

failed. Failed to protect those you
loved.

Christine crosses to the Man and squeezes his hand.
CHRISTINE
Jericho, don't blame yourself. You
- aia everything you could.

(She points to Heaven)
He let you down.

MAN
Quite right. .
The Man bends down and whispers in his ear.
MAN (cont'd)
He made you weak. Now show him that
you're strong. Fight for me.
JERICHO

(almost inaudible)
No.

MAN
Join me and reclaim everything he
took away from you.
Jericho's wife Emily, emerges from the crowd holding their
son David by the hand. Jericho looks at them, and he is weak.
So close to death, so in need of something to hold onto.

EMILY
Jericho, please.

Jericho struggles to his knees. His son, David, comes up.

DAVID
Daddy, it's going to be okay.
The little boy holds his hands out to his father.
103.

CHRISTINE
Go ahead, Jericho. Embrace him.

MAN
It's everything you want.

Jericho lifts out hig hands and pulls the boy into him. Holds
him tight. He fights back the tears until he can't.

The Man glances skyward with a tiny smile and then looks down
at Jericho.

MAN (cont'd)
You chose wisely.

The Man takes Christine in hand and walks through the parting
crowd. The Man's followers line up behind him ina
processional following him. :

Emily and David help Jericho to his feet. The three of them
are pulled along the processional line.

We pull back, higher and higher, until the processional line
looks like a stream of ants snaking through the streets of
New York.

ON JERICHO - He holds his son as they walk along with the ~
processional.

DAVID
I love you Dad.

JERICHO
I leve you too.

He looks at Emily and then at David... Something's wrong. He
slows just a little bit. Sadly. He lets David down, lets him
walk on his own, and then lets the boy's hand slip from his
own. —

He slows slightly, letting them get ahead of him in the
throng. Once they're a few paces ahead, Jericho stops. People
stream by him as he silently watches his wife and child drift
away in the crowd.

Jericho pushes his way through the stream of humanity until
he breaks out and edges into a dark alley.

“He steals away.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Times Square teems with hundreds of thousands of people. The “~
crowds part as the Man arrives with Christine.

MAN
All this is for you.

CHRISTINE

The Man laughs.

MAN
No. It's New Years in Times Square.
Christine, still lost in her rapture, looks on the miltitude.
CHRISTINE
All these souls...

MAN
All these souls are ours.
(in Latin)
The time has come. Bring forth the
temple.

The ground heaves. Concrete comes alive rising in the shape
of twiating men... buildings bend to the Man‘s will.

And now we can see a structure starting to form...

A MIGHTY TENPLE

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT
Deserted.

Alone, Jericho staggers through the devastation left in the
wake of evil.

Buildings are on fire.

The streets run red with blood.

Jericho sees a fallen gargoyle lying on the ground. He lifts
the heavy carved stone and carries it up the steps of a
mighty building.

Jericho stumbles and falls before it's heavy doors.

It is THE ARMORY.

Jericho pulls himself up, takes the gargoyle and smashes it
against the door. The wood splinters.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The ground ceases its rumbling as the temple has formed.

A TEN STORY PENTAGRAM stands behind an ALTAR atop a pyramid.
Steps appear on the angle of the pyramid, seemingly formed
from the faces of tormented souls.

Iyfr. ARMORY - NIGHT

A door opens and in steps Jericho, his clothes in tatters,
his face bloodied. He smiles... :

The room is filled with a CACHE of MILITARY ARMAMENTS.
Quick cuts as he --

GRABS an MK19 MOD3 AUTO~FEED GRENADE LAUNCHER --
Pulls down a SHOULDER LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILE --
Straps on AMMO BELTS --

Slings on TWO M-16 MACHINE GUNS --

Jericho steps out of the driver's seat.

Reaches in back.

Withdraws the SHOULDER LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILE.

THE MISSILE FLIES from its launcher and...

BOOM!

The garage door blows open.

JERICHO
Tine to give the Devil his due.
Jericho slides back into the HUMVEE and peels out.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Jericho steers the Humvee through the obstacle course of post
-viot debris. In the distance he sees the glowing fiery light
of Times Square, but just up ahead is an archway. “-_
>

106.

You could say it was soaring and majestic if it weren't for
the twisted wrecked frames of men, piled atop each other like
some freakish car accident.

Jericho slows the Humvee and looks on at this horror. The
writhing corpses moan out to him in unison.

‘VOICES
Go back! Go back!

Jericho drives the Humvee through the arches...
Inside ...

Jericho sees the mass of humanity huddled before the Temple.
He floors it.

The Followers scatter as the Humvee plows them aside.
at the foot of the temple ~-

THE MAN TAKES CHRISTINE by the hand and leads her up the
steps. But...

Jericho skids the Humvee to a halt by the Temple's base.

Followers rush the Humvee, but when Jericho opens fire with
an M-16, they cower away.

The square falls silent as Jericho exits the Humvee,
clutching the Grenade Launcher.

Jericho looks around at the lost souls, at the temple of evil.
The Man walks toward Jericho.

MAN
What happened Jericho? I thought we

had a deal.
JERICHO

SHWUMP! He FIRES. The GRENADE IMBEDS in the Man's chest.

BOOM! It EXPLODES. The Man catapults backward twenty feet,
slamming into the concrete.

Shwump! shwump!

Jericho fires two more grenades at the Man as he struggles to
his feet.

BOOM! BOOM! They explode with unbelievable force.

The Man tumbles down the roadway like he was hit by a train
and collapses in a pile of broken flesh.

Jericho crosses to him and looks down at what used to be the
Man's face. But now it's all sinews and singed skin.

MAN
(seething whisper)
You think you've won?
(beat)
This is but flesh.
And then THE GROUND BEGINS TO TREMBLE...
Jericho loses his balance and falls to the ground.
The Man's legs rip open.... and MIGHTY TALONS extend from ~~
them. A monstrous evil unfolds from the skin of the Man.
WINGS unfurl from his back. SCALES burst forth from his skin.

Jericho launches the Stinger. It impacts in Satan's belly and
explodes. The flesh and scales blow back revealing...

A THOUSAND TORMENTED SOULS inside the belly of the beast. ,
Satan reels back. Screaming in pain.

A handful of followers charge at Jericho, but he opens fire
with the M-16's blowing them back.

SATAN pulls back his arm and a swirling ball of fire rises in
it. He launches it at Jericho.

Jericho dives out of the way. The fireball sails over
Jericho's head slamming into the side of a building.

Jericho mounts another Stinger and FIRES.

The missile flies. But the Dark Angel dodges and the stinger
impacts against a billboard of a broadway play.

"CATS - NOW AND FOREVER" topples, crushing several hundred of
the followers.

More followers attack, but Jericho lets loose a barrage of
bullets from both sub-machine guns.

Satan draws another ball of fire from the air, and hurls it.

Jericho grabs for his weapons and rolls for cover just as a
fire ball hits the Humvee, BLOWING it to kingdom come.

Jericho slams another Stinger into the launcher. He takes
some time to ain.

Satan flaps his leathery wings and lift into the air like
some ancient dragon.

Jericho fires. WHHEOOOOOSH! This time the Missile slams into
Satan's head. BOOM! Lucifer's head explodes, raining fire
down from the sky.

The crowd of followers scatter to avoid the hellish shrapnel,
as the Dark Angel plummets to the ground.

Jericho slides his last Stinger into the launch tube.

Whe HEADLESS BODY rises from the pavement, swaying back and
forth, hands grasping at the air.

JERICHO (cont'd)
You're going down.

Jericho unleashes his last Stinger. WHOOOOSH! BAM! It slams
into the Dark Angel's belly, among the writhing masses.

BOOM! It explodes in a massive fireball of flesh and fire.

When the smoke clears, Satan is gone.

Jericho eyes the lingering smoke and fire. He hears a massive
groan coming from the heart of the city.

A thick fiery smoke hangs in the air and then slowly twists
back into form and substance. Smoke trails snake out,
wrapping themselves like a tentacle around Jericho. The
tentacle grows until it is a BONY HAND.

SATAN (V.0O)
You think your armaments can defeat
the immortals? Who do you think
taught mankind to build weapons?

Jericho is enveloped now. He yells, fighting to break free.
He rises in the air, twisting and turning until he's face-to-
face with THE BEAST.

He opens fire with the M-16. But the bullets wounds are
barely pinpricks on Satan's horrific scaly body.

SATAN
Yor thirty thousand years I've walked
through the hearts and minds of men
and your downfall is my glory. .
I have built the gas ovens of —
Auschwitz, I have haunted the killing
fields of Cambodia, I've spurred good
Christians to rape and lect in the
name of their Lord, I've sent Muslims
on horrific Jihads, and I've
scattered the Jews to the four
corners of the world. I lit the fire
that made Troy burn and I stood by
and watched mankind nail the Son of
God to a wooden cross. I was there in
the beginning on the tree of life. I
am the beginning and the end. I am
light and I am death. I can not be
defeated. I am forever.

Satan tosses Jericho away.

Jericho sails through the air, arms flailing and SMASHES
through the STAINED GLASS WINDOW of a church.

Jericho pushes himself up onto one knee. He rests. The strain
is too much to bear. His head is bowed because he cannot hold

JERICHO
Help me. Please.

In answer to his prayer, there is silence.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

SATAN lays Christine on an altar below a massive STONE
PENTAGRAM. Demonic figures are carved around its face.

SATAN
(in Latin)
I command thee as the Lord of Man.
Open the Gates to my kingdom!
The stone pentagram rumbles and slowly slides open.

A FIRESTORM SWIRLS in its center. We see human shapes... the
vague outlines of the souls of the damned.

It's truly a churning pit of fiery death like nothing we've
ever seen before except in our darkest nightmare.

The GROUND RUMBLES as THE GATES OF HELL open.

Jericho sees the sword. He's transfixed by it. He picks it

He takes off his M-16s and tosses them to the ground.

EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

Jericho emerges from the fiery structure of the church to see
Satan reaching down for Christine on the altar.

Jericho bellows...

JERICHO
Lucifer!

Satan turns. He sees Jericho, beaten and bloodied, looking
like the Devil himself.

SATAN
Jericho, how many times must you be
beaten!

JERICHO

Until you finish me.

MAN
Step aside or I shall inflict
torments on you never known to human
souls.

Emily and David emerge from the crowd.

EMILY
Jericho, please. You can't defeat hin.

JERICHO

You cannot trick me!

SATAN _
You defy me, but can you turn your
back on your family again? Can you

eyes out and rip their flesh from
their bones while you watch helpless.

David comes to Jericho.
DAVID
Please, Daddy. Don't let him hurt us.
JERICHO
tides! My family is dead.
And Jericho swings his sword at his wife and son.

As tHe blade strikes flesh, the two become terrifying DEMONS.
They cry cut in horror as they melt into the air.

SATAN ~

Jericho, I am an Angel of the Lord.
You are but a man. How do you expect
to defeat me in all my glory?

Satan stalks toward him.

JERICHO
I may be just a man. But I am made in
the image of my maker.
(beat)
And I have faith.

Satan pauses and sits on his haunches, trying to leok into
Jericho's heart.

JERICHO (cont'd)
It is in my power to defeat you.

Satan's terrifying head swings over him. Jericho slowly
raises the bronze sword to the ready. Satan backs away.

SATAN
You will need more than a piece of
metal to defeat me.
JERICHO -_
- The weapon doesn't matter. The battle
is won within.

The Beast's claw swipes at Jericho. Jericho brings the sword
to bear. We see a flash of metal. A shower of sparks. The
Beast roars back, in real pain for the first time.

Jericho advances, thrusting at the Beast. The sword flashes
in the flames of fire and it becomes FORGED OF STEEL, ITS
HANDLE CRUSTED WITH JEWELS, just like the swords in the
illuminated manuscripts. THE SWORD OF FAITH.

The BEAST ROARS BACK.

His sharp tail whips around like a scorpion's, stabbing at
Jericho.

Jericho parries and thrusts back.

Jericho stabs the tail of the Beast. It recoils in pain and
siams into Jericho sending him flying through the air. He
lands on the steps of the temple, his momentum sending him
tumbling down.

THE BEAST claws down the stone steps.

The TEMPLE shakes with every step. Fires burn in satan's —
eyes. His body bristles with spikes.
>

114.
Satan raises his talon into the air above Jericho. Jericho —
zreolls out of the way, just as he slams his talon down.

The earth shakes and the stone steps crack. The Temple begins
TO BLEED.

Jericho rolls down the steps, trying to get away.

Satan raises his talon again, but this time as he brings it
down, Jericho stabs the sword upward and into it.

The Beast recoils and roars. WOUNDED. The blood of hell drips
from the wound and rains down, exploding like grenades as it
hits the earth.

Jericho runs for cover.

The Beast's tail swings round. A hundred serpents grow from
it, each head snapping out at Jéricho. Jericho swings his
mighty sword, striking through the viper's nest and severing
the heads of the snakes. The snake heads continue to snap as
they roll into balls of fire on the ground.

Jericho dives over the flailing tail, and raises the sword
just in time to deflect a blow from Satan, wounding him again.

And then the BATTLE IS JOINED.
We've never seen anything like it.

Jericho is possessed of faith and powers beyond our
comprehension as he drives into the breach.

HOLY STEEL against the FIRES OF EVIL, exchanging blow after
blow. Jericho battles like a righteous warrior, a one man
holy crusade.

Atop the Temple they fight, the darkness lit by the unholy
fires which consume the mighty towers of Gotham.

SATAN
Submit Jericho, and I shall make you
the king of kings.
JERICHO
You can offer me nothing.
Satan reels back. Jericho advances.

ATOP the TEMPLE - IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE, THE NEW YEARS BALL
BEGINS TO DROP.

JERICHO (cont'd)
I renounce thee.

Jericho takes the fight to Satan, driving him back, driving ”
him down on his knees and as he is about to plunge the
into Satan's chest...

The ball reaches bottom. Happy new year flashes and... .
A mighty trumpet roars.

SATAN ROARS a HORRIBLE CRY OF LOSS.

Jericho stays his sword.

Satan's wings unfurl as a great wind blows pulling him toward
the opening in the Pentagram.

JERICHO (cont'd)
It's over.

Satan struggles against the winds of heaven that drive him
back toward the swirling pit.

SATAN
Over? It's not over!

His scales bristle. His eyes alight with fire.
SATAN (cont'd) —_
A thousand years is nothing to me! :
JERICHO
To me, it's enough.

SATAN
You grow weaker every time.

Jericho crosses to Christine on the Altar. She wakes at his
touch. Looks up blinking... in disbelief... herself again.

CHRISTINE _
Sericho.

He gathers her up in his arms.

Behind him, as Satan tumbles back into hell, something snakes
out of the demon's body and shoots through the portal. A
tentacle of some kind.

SATAN
You dare to turn your back on me?

CHRISTINE
Jericho!

BATAN -~

Z shall have thee yet.
 

116.

The tentacle snakes out and wraps around Christine, pulling
ber from Jericho's arms. It drags her to the closing gate.

CHRISTINE
Oh god, help me. Please help me.

Jericho lunges to her and grabs her hand before she crosses
the threshold.

JERICHO
Hold on.

Christine's feet are pulled across the threshold. Everything
zumbles. The temple shakes.

Christine is caught in a tug of war between good and evil.

SATAN .
I have you now. Let go and come to me.

The suction from hell increases. Dying souls all over the
world are being sucked into the inferno screaming. All around
them the ghostly souls are pulled in creating a strong wind.

She still hangs there, as if she was hanging from a
precipice, dangling over a twenty thousand foot drop into
eternal darkness and damnation. Satan dangles in the hellfire
below clinging onto Christine. The stones are closing in
around her.

CURISTINE
Don't let me fall. Please, don't let
me fall!

JERICHO.
You're not gonna fall. Hold on!

Satan climbs up his own tentacle, coming closer. He reaches
out with his curled mangled fingers to grab her, but Jericho
lifts the sword and holding Christine with one hand, he
heaves the sword end-over-end into the underworld. It slans
right into Satan's gut.

Using all bis strength he fights the slipstream of evil as he
pulls Christine back through the Gates of Hell just as they
slam closed forever. As all the stones join, sealing the
entrance A STARBURST OF ENERGY RADIATES OUT.

BOOOOOM! :
The two of them are surrounded by fire.
Jericho rises to find Christine unconscious next to him. He

fights the thick smoke as he struggles to his feet. He looks
around but all he can see are flames.
117.

Be scrambles to pick up Christine and through the flames he
makes out a door of some kind.

He rushes through the flames to the doorway and pushes
through it out onto...
EXT. NEW YOR CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Jericho emerges from the front door of the CHURCH. The flames
and smoke are thick all around.

Fire trucks and police cars slide to a halt in front of then.

The firemen come rushing up to Jericho, who cradles Christine
in his arms.

FIREMAN
What happened?

Jericho looks around. Aside from the fire, the city is calm
and peaceful. Pedestrians walk the street as normal. The sky
above is clear and the stars shine down from heaven.
Jericho looks back at the Fireman.

SERICHO - -_
‘There was a fire.

He keeps walking, Christine in his arms.

JERICHO (cont'd)
But I put it out.

We rise up into the night, away from the fire and back

towards heavens. Everything in the city is how it was. Maybe
even better.

SYNOPSIS:

In 1975---shortly after a baby girl is born in an NYC
hospital, a nurse secretly rushes the infant to a Satanic ritual
where she's baptized in blood and “marked for darkness". When the
baby girl is returned to its mother, she's named CHRISTINE.

Today, NYC~--JERICHO is an officer who works for a private
security firm. Presently he and a partner, CHICAGO, are protecting
a diplomat on his way to the UN. As the diplomat arrives at the UN
lq, a SHOOTER is spotted on a nearby roof. Jericho shoves the
diplomat aside and takes several rounds of shots in his bullet
proof vest. The diplomat is safe, and Jericho and Chicago chase
after the shooter in a helicopter. As the shooter is about to jump
from the roof, Jericho grabs him. But as the shooter then begins
to blast Jericho, he's dropped from the 'copter----and a parachute
unfurls. The shooter ducks into the subway, and Jericho gives
chase again, finally cornering the guy and cuffing him. But...the
shooter suddenly transforms into a hideous monster and tells
Jericho that he's powerless to stop the dark Angel. As the shooter
transforms back to a human form, Jericho is stunned. He wonders if
he's going nuts as the shooter is taken off to a hospital.

Meanwhile...in Hell's Kitchen, flames shoot high from a
crack in the pavement. From the flames a mysterious MAN (Satan)
appears and walks away...and an Albino man witnesses the event.
Later, Jericho does some research on the shooter and discovers
that he's not only a religious nutball but a man who was not
targeting the UN diplomat but him. Jericho wonders why HE was
being targeted! In the shooter's possession is also pictures of an
unknown woman. -

That woman happens to be CHRISTINE BETHLEHEM---the same one
we saw being born in 1975 and baptized in blood. Christine is a
pre-school teacher with a sweet disposition, but lately she's been
experiencing terrifying visions that she can't explain. Satan, in
the meantime, goes to visit the shooter in his hospital room and
crucifies him to the wall. When Jericho and a detective go to
visit the shooter to ask questions they find him nearly dead.
Written in Hebrew on the shooter's body are two names---one is
Jericho and the other is Bethlehem. As the shooter dies, Jericho
realizes that he might be in danger. And he wonders who Bethlehem
is as well. Jericho pays a visit to the Church of St. John the
Divine and talks to FATHER MURPHY bout the shooter, whose name was
Thomas and who used to be a priest. Murphy is closed mouth, and
tells Jericho he wouldn't believe even if he told him.

Christine is on her way home when a homeless man approaches
and says "he's on his way”. And when she gets to her apartment,
two COMMANDOS are waiting for her and try to abduct her.
Meanwhile, Jericho has managed to track the identity of
"Bethlehem" to Christine, and he and Chicago arrive just in time
to rescue her. The commandos flee. Christine is frightened, and
her roommate RACHEL offers support. Jericho puts a guard on

SYNOPSIS (continued):

Christine for the night, and Chicago sets up a command post
outside. Christine wonders what's going on, and Jericho reads up
on Satanic heraldry...and he becomes aware of Satanic prophecies
about the End of Days, when Satan comes to claim a bride and take
over the world. Even the righteous will not survive. As Jericho
considers the meaning of this, Satan attacks the command post
outside Christine's place and blows it up. Chicago and the other
guards are killed. Jericho begins to drag Christine away to
safety, but her roommate Rachel then changes into a demonic beast
who tries to stop them. Jericho is forced to shoot Rachel dead. _
When the cops finally arrive on-the scene and see the destruction
(including the dead bodies of Chicago and the guards), they see
Rachel---in normal human form---dead from Jericho's gunshots. The
cops take Jericho to police hq and hold him and begin asking
Christine questions. But at the police hg, Satan arrives and tries
to get her. Jericho blocks him and flees with Christine into the
park----and they're chased by red-eyed minions of the devil. They
finally arrive at St. John the Divine Cathedral. Father Murphy is
there to help them hide, and he tells them of the coming of
darkness and that Satan is looking for a bride...the signal of
doom. But Father Murphy claims the bible tells of a PROTECTOR, of
great faith and virtue, who comes forth to safeguard and defend
the chosen woman. Jericho claims he's couldn't possibly be the
protector if he's someone of great faith and virtue.

Meanwhile...in the city chaos begins to reign. People begin
to riot and loot stores. As Jericho tries to secretly return to
his apartment, he's confronted by Satan who wants him to reveal
where Christine is hiding. Satan offers Jericho anything he wants
for this information...but Jericho refuses. Satan then tries to
throw Jericho to his death, but Jericho manages to grab Satan and
toss him to the street below. As Satan impacts on the pavement a
huge crater is made. It doesn't seem as if anything could survive
this fall, but Satan picks himself up and leaves. Jericho is then
approached by Chicago who claims he's not dead but alive; Chicago
wants to get out of the crazy city. Jericho isn't sure if Chicago
is a trick or not. Back at the cathedral, meanwhile, a Cardinal
decides to sacrifice Christine to prevent the devil from getting
her. But Jericho arrives and to protect and save her. And at the
same time Satan arrives and begins to entrance Christine. A fight
erupts between Jericho and Satan and the cathedral begins to
collapse into a pile. As Jericho and Christine are dragged into a
pit, they get away and escape into the city sewers. Christine and
Jericho are chased by not only the devil but his red-eyed
followers. Christine wants to get Satan out of her mind---he seems
to have entranced her.

Jericho and Christine escape the sewer, finding the city in
total chaos. The get into a car and are chased once again. As they
try to flee the city, the find that bridges and tunnels are
destroyed. They finally escape into an underground garage where
they encounter Chicago again----but Chicago is obviously possessed

and Jericho finally destroys him. Jericho drags Christine to the
nuclear shelter 400 feet below the surface of Manhattan. As they
wait there, Satan finds them and drags the shelter to the surface.
Satan then confronts Christine again, and she must try to resist
him. Jericho is then beaten by Satan's minions, and he cries for
help. Satan asks Jericho to join him, and finally Jericho
succumbs. Satan then addresses his followers and brings forth a
mighty temple in the city. But...Jericho slips away and goes to an_
armory where he drags out weapons and begins to attack Satan and
his new establishment. A huge battle erupts, and Satan claims he
canNOT be destroyed. Jericho is seen kneeling and praying---and
asking for help. Jericho then finds a Sword of Faith, and with it
he attacks Satan, now transformed into a beast. At the same time
Christine turns her back to Satan and renounces him. As the battle
rages on, Jericho is finally able to destroy Satan (at least for
now), and he caries Christine away from the scene in his
arms---just as the fire department and cops arrive to take over.

COMMENTS:
Marlowe has created an imaginative, exciting and very dynamic
supernatural thriller. While it contains some of the predictable
beats of a doomsday tale with a fairly static Satan figure
threatening to destroy the world, the battles that erupt between
the heroic security officer and the demonic forces are nicely
conceived and full of resourceful and inventive special effects.
The piece is, after all, special effects driven with NYC taking
the brunt of all the destruction and mayhem. Not only is there
chaos in the streets of the city as Satan and his minions try to
establish a foothold, but buildings collapse, others are pulled
from the underground and éfire and brimstonei makes its presence
known---on a very large scale. The heart and soul, so to speak,
of the drama lies in the characters of the heroic security officer
who becomes the iProtectori of the woman chosen by Satan to be his
wife. This character goes up against some of the most incredible
obstacles imaginable---demons, burning buildings, zombies, quakes,

. @tc.---and still manages to stand on his two feet. Touchingly, he

seems to succumb to the power of Satan and momentarily become one
of his minions, but this turns out to be only a trick to get
closer to the devil and destroy him---which he does in blazing
glory. And speaking of glory---the material also is not afraid to
bring up questions of faith and virtue; the heroic security
officer is not afraid to finally ask for help from God, and it is
in these final moments when he accepts God and renounces Satan
that the script has its most powerful emotional impact. The script
winds up succeeding on a couple of levels---the truly physical,
action driven one, and the more sensitive, holy one. The script
isnit entirely perfect, though. We wonder why the heroic officer,
Jericho, was targeted for destruction from the beginning----before
he even meets Satanis intended wife; and if this is the case, we
wonder why Satan canit simply remove Jericho as an obstacle. As a
result of many similar questions the script seems, from time to
time, to be overly manipulated and contrived. But the action
sequences seem to distract us from this, and the energy never
subsides. We also wonder why Satan canit just pick any woman he
wants as a wife, not necessarily one who had to be ébaptized in
blood{ 25 years earlier. Be that as it may, the script is dynamic
and offers both action and food for religious thought.
